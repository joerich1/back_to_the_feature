FIRST DRAFT
THE GUNBARREL OPENS ON --

EXT THE FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Amongst the mixture of lush vineyards and rolling mountains -- a
sleek streamlined train bullets past at over two hundred

miles an hour As soon as we take this in however the

wheels retract like the landing gear of an airplane -- the
train is now virtually flying bound to the track only by an
inch-high magnetic field As its speed increases we hear --

STATION AGENT (VO)
Control to Hamilton -- both Paris and
Bordeaux stations reported secure -- what
is your status -- over --

INSIDE THE ENGINE CAR OF THE TRAIN

A digital speedometer near the ENGINEER confirms the train is
moving at two hundred and fifty miles per hour and climbing --
next to him is a British agent named HAMILTON speaking into a
headset radio As he speaks an unctuous SOMMELLIER brings a
cart into the engine car - and hands him a cup of tea

HAMILTON

All secure at the engine car - the only
danger here is this bloody awful tea
Seems that we’ve turned out for a false
alarm -- over --

(we can’t hear reply)
-- no - he got the glamour end of the
assignment as usual

With that we move to --
THE REAR OBSERVATION CAR ON THE TRAIN

which is lavishly furnished -- the people who built this train
designed it for comfort as well as speed Windows everywhere
show the breathtaking view of the countryside at this speed
What’s notable here is despite the speed there is zero
vibration from the travel -- these people might as well be ina
room that’s sitting still A proud pompous French FINANCIER
finishes emptying a bottle of champagne into a pyramid of
crystal glasses to applause from the three dozen elegantly
dressed people on board As waiters pass out glasses --

FINANCIER
It does not feel like three hundred miles
an hour n’est pas
(crowd LAUGHS)
Now the wheels have retracted and the
MLV-9 is in flight -- the magnetic
levitation system will spare us and our
cars the interminable drive from Paris to
Bordeaux We reach Bordeaux in one hour -
(checks watch smiles)
-- just in time for the wine auction
(MORE)
FINANCIER (cont’d)
(crowd LAUGHS)
So a toast --
(raises glass)
To the maiden voyage of the MLV-9 -- to
you whose backing made it possible -- and
to many more swift smooth rides

The wealthy crowd responds by applauding and raising their
glasses as we MOVE to the fringe of the crowd -- a hand takes a
glass of champagne from a tray -- the hand belongs to a man
apart from the laughter and gaiety -- the man is --

JAMES BOND

who stands alone by a window the world whistling past him But
he is not here to celebrate the unveiling of a new train
Carefully he watches the crowd -- if trouble comes who will it
come from Bonds eye catches --

BOND’S POV - THE SOMMELLIER

who we saw a moment ago in the engine compartment - now he’s
opened a fresh bottle of champagne for the financier The
sommellier pours the financier a fresh glass first -- even
though there are several women nearby with empty glasses --

BOND‘S FACE

reveais he has noticed this -- but Bond’s observation is broken
by a voice -- the perfect English is lightly honeyed with a
Russian accent --

MARINA (0S)
You look concerned about the speed

Bond turns to face --
MARINA VAROSKAYA

And the promise of the voice is fulfilled The first glance
reveals the hard Slavic lines of her face framed by auburn hair
-- and the soft sloping curves of her body enveloped in a
black hourglass dress

Bond warms to her immediately This is a woman whose secrets
he’d like to discover

MARINA
You shouldn’t worry Every function on
this train is computer controlled There
is no safer way to travel

BOND
(amused)
I’m glad you’re sure of that
MARINA
(not to boast -- just a
statement of fact)
Entirely I worked on the train’s design
(doesn’t recgonize him)
You are one of the investors Mister --

BOND

Bond James Bond No I just appreciate a

smooth ride --
Bond looks away for a moment --
BOND’S POV - THE SOMMELLIER
leaves the front of the car pulling the bottle cart with hin
BOND
would prefer not to but he breaks away from Marina --

BOND
Excuse me --

Bond follows the sommellier into the next car -- meanwhile --
HIGH ABOVE THE TRAIN — A HELICOPTER

roars out from behind one of the mountains -- and begins to
track over the train -- and --

IN THE FRONT ENGINE ROOM OF THE TRAIN

The engineer -- and Hamilton - lie dead on the floor of the
car Worse as the speedometer digitally tracks up -- 301 MPH --
304 MPH -- 308 MPH - a packet of plastique attached to the
controls has a timer ticking down -- 0400 -- 0359 --

IN THE PASSENGER CAR THE SOMMELLIER

drags his cart through a lavishly designed but empty passenger
car -- the party is back in the observation car -- as the
sommellier moves through the next door Bond follows to --

THE AUTO FERRY CAR

which is stacked with the sort of automobiles one would
associate with the crowd in the rear car -- BMWs Mercedes
Jaguars and so on are stacked on two-tiered decks that are on
the right and left side of the car with an aisle in the middle

The sommellier moves ahead -- still pulling the cart -- but a
VOICE calls out behind him saying something in rapid
FRENCH -- the sommellier turns to see --

BOND
who is smiling non-confrontational standing halfway back in

the car He repeats himself -- but it’s clear the sommellier
doesn’t understand what Bond said

Blankly he nods and smiles as if Bond said something terribly
witty -- and he turns to move on

Bonds face darkens as he takes a Walther P-88 -- a 9MM
fifteen shot cousin of the PPK -- out of his jacket --

BOND
What I said monsieur was that a
genuine sommellier would have served
champagne for the ladies first -- not
for the host --

With that the sommellier KICKS the cart back at Bond pulling
his huge twin-function gun out of it first -- it’s a machine gun
on top a shell-firing shotgun underneath --

-- Bond FIRES at the sommellier but has to duck out of the way

of the hurtling cart -- he dives away onto the hood of one of
the cars rolling behind it as the sommellier FIRES a shell
straight down the middle -- the door to the passenger section is

SHREDDED with the impact of the explosive shell -

-- Bond rolls on the hood of a Lamborghini and behind it moving
back between the car and the train’s side and behind another
car -- just in time too -- a second SHELL pierces and
DETONATES the Lamborghini’s gas tank the flames shooting out
where Bond was a second ago and BLASTING out a window --

IN THE REAR OBSERVATION CAR - THE CROWD

is panicking -- at the sound of the shots and EXPLOSIONS and
the resulting shaking of the observation car champagne flies
and the crowd SCREAMS diving for cover «

-- except for Marina -- instead of diving down she runs into
the next passenger car toward the turmoil --

IN THE AUTO FERRY CAR - BOND

crouches behind the lower row of cars -- he can’t go forward
because two cars are blazing -- the sommellier FIRES an
explosive shell and Bond dives back again as a Ferrari
EXPLODES in a 400000 fireball right behind him --

-- now Bond is cornered between the rear of the compartment and
the last car on this row -- if the somnellier blows this car
Bond goes with it —-

IN THE PASSENGER CAR - MARINA

is thrown off her feet by the blast -- she’s scared but she
moves with determination to the front where this car joins with
the ferry car -- there she opens a panel that contains an
electronic control terminal with the train’s emergency safety
features She keys in an “emergency stop -- but the system
won’t -- she frantically keys something else -- meanwhile --
IN THE AUTO FERRY CAR - THE SOMMELLIER

knows he has Bond pinned -- he FIRES the machine gun at the
car that’s between him and Bond -- the car’s front and rear
catch fire -- when the flames join the car will explode --
CLOSE ON BOND

who opts to leave -- he knocks out the glass of the train window
with the Walther and climbs out --

ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE TRAIN - BOND REACHES

for the upper part of the window and pulls himself out the
DEAFENING wind tearing at him as he does -- at three hundred
miles an hour this is like hanging onto the outside of a
jet -- Bond grips the quarter inch of trim and swings to the
rear of the car an instant before --

-- the explosion of the nearest car blasts past Bond --

IN THE AUTO FERRY CAR THE FLAMING CAR

spreads the fire to the upper deck’s line of cars --

-- the sommellier knocked by the concussion loses his gun --
recovering he runs to the front of the train -- just as -

IN THE PASSENGER CAR - MARINA

terrified at the sound of the nearby BLAST desperately keys
something else into this terminal -- and this one works --

THE PASSENGER CAR’S COUPLING LATCHES

disengage from the rest of the hurtling train -- the steel
wheels drop down grinding and SPARKING and the disconnected
cars safely slow down -- the passengers now are safe --

ON THE END OF THE TRAIN - BOND

fights the wind that threatens to peel him off the train’s side
but he allows himself a split second to look back at Marina
intrigued -- who is this brave beautiful woman who’s falling
behind him --

AT THE DOOR OF THE SLOWING PASSENGER CAR - MARINA

stares at Bond too -- but she’s far more doubtful of this cold
bastard hanging on the side of a burning train --

ON TOP OF THE TRAIN - BOND CLIMBS UP
-- and crouching low starts to run up toward the front of the

train -- but as he does another of the autos this one on the
upper deck EXPLODES TEARING through the roof --

-- the force of it throws Bond ahead -- he lands badly

SKIDDING half off the train -- Bond desperately grips the smooth
siding of the train -- the design looks sleek but just try
getting a handhold on it --

LONG VIEW OF TRAIN

As it heads into a tunnel carved into the mountains the rear
end on fire and pouring smoke -- the helicopter moves down to
track closer with the train --

INSIDE HELICOPTER - COCKPIT POV
as it stays behind the train matching its speed and following

it into the tunnel -- the PILOT is busy with the controls
as a GUNNER readies a winch to pick up the faux sommellier -

CLOSE ON BOND

as he stabilizes and pulls himself firmly onto the roof -- he
stands and pulls out the Walther -- but a chain lashes at his
hand knocking the gun away - he spins to face --

-- the sommellier who is wearing a harness so the helicopter
can pick him up -- and wielding a heavy length of chain --
he swings it at Bond again --

INSIDE HELICOPTER - COCKPIT POV

There’s sufficient room in this tunnel for the copter to hover
over the train -- the co-pilot takes out a machine gun and
prepares to shoot Bond -- but the sommellier blocks a clear
shot --

ON TOP OF TRAIN - BOND AND SOMMELLIER
The sommellier slashes at Bond with the chain again and again

forcing Bond toward the front of the train -- now they’re on the
engine car and there’s nowhere left for Bond to duck back to --

IN THE AUTO FERRY CAR

Another car catches fire and the gas tank EXPLODES --

ON TOP OF THE ENGINE CAR - BOND AND SOMMELLIER

The force of it shakes the train enough that the sommellier’s

footing is uncertain -- Bond takes the split second to lunge
forward -- and both Bond and the sommellier fall and roll

toward the front of the engine and down the sloping nose --
FRONT VIEW - NOSE OF TRAIN AS BOND AND SOMMELLIER FALL

Bond stops himself grabbing a crevice under the train’s
windshield -- only his fingertips are holding him -- the
sommellier gets a better grip on the car’s trim over Bond -- he
prepares to knock Bond off with the chain --
- but Bond grabs the wine opener from the sommellier’s vest
and SLASHES his chain arm in mid-swing knocking the loose end
of the chain under the train --

-- the chain whips under the train and catches dragging the
sommellier down head first underneath the train --

BOND

hangs on wincing as the sommellier’s SCREAM is cut short and
segues to the sickening SOUND of a body being LIQUIFIED through
the inch high gap between train and track --

FRONT VIEW OF BOND ON HURTLING TRAIN

Bond reaches up for a two-handed grip on the crevice and
kicks at the train’s huge windshield -- the force of each kick

threatening to knock him off the train -- we can see but Bond
can’t that --

THE HELICOPTER IS MOVING OVER THE TOP OF THE TRAIN

and sweeping toward the front --

-- Bond kicks the windshield again -- finally it SHATTERS and
Bond climbs in -- just in time to get out of the path of --

-- the helicopter -- its skids mow inches from where Bond
was as he dives into the engine car tumbling behind the
controls --

INSIDE THE ENGINE CAR - BOND

lands amidst the bodies of Hamilton and the engineer -- and he
sees the timer on the bomb ticking -- 0040 -- 0039 --

-- Bond reaches for the bomb to defuse it -- but the engine

compartment is riddled with machine gun fire --
THE HELICOPTER

is flying ahead of the train -- the gunner is FIRING back into
the engine compartment --

INSIDE THE ENGINE CAR - BOND

has to choose between death now and thirty seconds from now -
he gets into a crouch and runs back into --

THE ADJACENT CAR

-- as the FUSILLADE still chases him back bullets penetrating
everywhere through the thin walls of the car -

IN THE HELICOPTER — THE PILOT AND CO-PILOT

seem pleased -- the helicopter pulls up far enough ahead of the
train to be beyond the bomb’s effects when it goes off --
CLOSE ON TIMER OF BOMB
-- 0027 -- 0026 --
CLOSE ON BOND

whose face betrays his hopelessness -- put he’s hit by a sudden
inspiration -- with new determination he runs back to --

THE AUTO FERRY CAR

- the roof is shredded by the explosions the interior is
shrouded in black smoke But the left half of the deck is
untouched by fire -- Bond looks to the upper row of cars --
IN THE HELICOPTER - THE PILOT AND CO-PILOT

seem to merely be waiting for the explosion --

CLOSE ON BOND’S HAND

which is turning an ignition key -- the steering wheel bears
the silver winged Aston Martin insignia -

IN THE HELICOPTER - THE COPILOT
looks back -- his eyes widen and his jaw drops --
FRONT VIEW OF TRAIN’S ROOF - BOND’S ASTON MARTIN DB7

drives o of a tear the roof that acts as a ram

on to
of the train’s roof RACING toward the nose of the train --
IN THE HELICOPTER THE CO-PILOT

comes to his senses and aims the machine gun firing back at
the car -- but --

BOND DRIVES THE CAR DOWN THE NOSE OF THE TRAIN
and onto the track driving under the line of strafing

fire and accelerating enough to stay ahead of the train -- he
speeds up and drives underneath the copter -- the car’s roof

CLANGS against the copter’s skids knocking the copter up and
out of control --

-- the helicopter SLAMS back colliding with the train and
flipping -- the copter doesn’t explode it just tangles with
the train’s torn engine compartment the skids and blade

DRAGGING against the track in a geyser of SPARKS that slow
the train slightly -- just enough to give a ten foot margin to
BOND

who floors the accelerator to get out of the tunnel before the
bomb goes off or the train runs him over or both --
INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - THE CO-PILOT

is now upside-down hanging from his seatbelt wishing he didn’t
have a window seat view of --

THE TIMER OF THE BOMB
-- 0002 -- 0001 -- and
THE TRAIN AND THE HELICOPTER DETONATE

simultaneously -- the force of it creating a surging FIREBALL
that just licks the exhaust of --

BOND’S ASTON MARTIN BURSTING OUT OF THE TUNNEL’S END

- the flames right behind him -- and flaming debris shooting
out all around the car --

INSIDE THE ASTON MARTIN BOND’S HANDS

are flying on the steering wheel and the gearshift trying to
slow down and not lose control on the track -- as --

ON A NEARBY COUNTRY ROAD - A GORGEOUS FRENCH WOMAN

named AIMEE is oblivious to the mayhem a few hundred yards
away -- she’s too upset by the fact that her Peugot has chosen
this deserted albeit lovely spot to overheat -- meanwhile -
IN THE ASTON MARTIN - BOND

barely maintains control as the car careens off the track and
onto a dirt road skidding in a cloud of dust toward ---

THE COUNTRY ROAD - AIMEE
can’t believe her eyes as the Aston Martin finally BRAKES to a

halt alongside her car -- she can’t believe her luck when Bond
gets out looking more like he’s stepped off a GQ cover than
out of an exploding train In short -- she’s interested
AIMEE
Thank you so much for stopping --
(anxious)
Are you going to Bordeaux
BOND
Not today apparently --
AIMEE
(hopes dashed)
Merde -- I shall never make it to the

wine auction in time --

(points to bottle in car)
That’s a Petrous ‘61 -- it’s worth at
least ten thousand francs -- now what am
I to do with it

Bond considers her problem --

BOND
My plans have gone off the rails too --
(in French)
-- wouldn’t it be a shame to waste both
that bottle and this afternoon

Bond draws the sommellier’s spike out of his pocket Aimee
considers it just long enough to smile an answer --

MAIN TITLES

EXT SEVERNAYA - RUSSIAN SECTION OF ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY

It’s the end of a very long night in this part of the Arctic --
the first dawn in six months is just starting to break Situated
in the middle of the endless white ice is a deceptively small
installation -- and a notably large dish antenna both painted
white for camoflage The only thing breaking the silence is the
distant WHOPPING of --

A PAIR OF TRANSPORT SIZE HELICOPTERS

that even at first glance appear to be of an unusual design The
cockpit is more enclosed like a tank’s and the metal finish
makes it appear that the body is an unusual compound as well
The PILOT mikes his radio --

(NOTE BOLD sentences in dialogue indicate subtitled Russian)

PILOT
Atomic Energy Control calling Severnaya
Station -- come in Severnaya Station --
urgent -

INT SEVERNAYA STATION - AT A RADIO CONSOLE

sits a bored young COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER who answers the call
As he speaks we note that the inside of the station is larger
than it appears outside -- it’s sunk into the ice housing the
array of electronic consoles that control radar monitoring
equipment - and four Soviet ICBMs housed nearby Near those
consoles against a wall we see a tightly sealed vault door We
note too that there is a sketeton crew for such an important
installation -- perhaps a dozen young men

COM OFFICER
Severnaya Station to AEI Control -- what
is “urgent -- over --

PILOT (0S)
Aerial scan of area indicates radiation
leakage from silotwo -- immediate evac
necessary -- over --
The com officer casts a look around at the crew and the
equipment No red lights No klaxons No leak

COM OFFICER
Our instruments show no such leak AEI --
you are mistaken -- over --

As he responds we find our way to --
A YOUNG RUSSIAN TECHNICIAN

named VICTOR who stands suddenly fearfully from his
monitoring station --

VICTOR
(shouts)
Housing breakdown in silo two

WIDER ON THE ROOM

as a status display screen for the silos flashes RED on the
graphic for silo two -- and a KLAXON starts clanging The other
officers inside decide Severnaya is a new way to spell
Chernobyl -- they start running up a metal staircase toward
the building’s exit --

ON HELIOPTERS

as they draw nearer to the installation flying low over the
endless field of ice --

PILOT
Evacuate station Severnaya -- transport
is on the way --

IN THE BASE - THE RUSSIAN OFFICERS

frantically get the hell out some grabbing codebooks others
just tearing up the stairs -- but the com officer stands
puzzled -- something’s wrong This is confirmed as he looks at
Victor -- who is notably not rushing out of the building The
com officer moves over to Victor and confronts him angrily in
Russian shoving him away from his console --

OUTSIDE THE BASE - THE RUSSIAN OFFICERS

run out of the building’s twin exits as if it were on fire
YELLING in Russian and waving at the helicopters -- which are
now practically upon the building and dip lower

INSIDE THE COPTER - COCKPIT POV OF THE RUSSIANS

We can’t see the faces of the men inside -- the pilot reaches
for a button -- but a gloved hand signals for him to stop --

TREVELYAN (05S)
Not yet

(beat)

Allow them a final look at the dawn

INSIDE THE BASE - THE COM OFFICER

hits the keyboard at Victor’s station - and his suspicion is
confirmed -- the radiation light goes out and the klaxon stops
The leak is a fake Victor gets up to attack the com

officer -- but he pulls his sidearm and shoots Victor twice --

INSIDE THE COPTER - COCKPIT POV OF THE RUSSIANS

The helicopter is almost upon them -- and inside the cockpit
the gloved hand waves -- now -

OUTSIDE THE BASE - THE HELICOPTERS

ire on the men with front mounted machine guns
cutting them down on the ice Some of them run -- but there’s
nowhere they can run to -- as the helicopters circle around
the building the Russian officers are cut to ribbons

INSIDE THE BASE - THE COM OFFICER

can hear the GUNFIRE above -- he rushes to the nuclear missile
controls punches in a code and throws destruct levers on the
consoles one by one -- the controls for silo one EXPLODE in a
shower of SPARKS -- he throws another lever EXPLODING the
controls for silo two --

OUTSIDE THE BASE - THE HELICOPTERS

land amid the bodies their last breaths STEAMING out in the
subzero air

As the copters touch down the last Russian officer alive --
wounded cursing -- pulls his sidearm and rushes one copter from
the side FIRING in a futile last gesture -- but he is cut down
by a single SHOT to the heart from

AUGUSTUS TREVELYAN

who exits the helicopter his automatic smoking unaffected by
all this death He is in his 60s -- unmistakably British -- yet
just as unmistakably at home in Russia If his face registers
any emotion now it’s probably only an appreciation for the
arctic dawn

INSIDE THE BASE - THE COM OFFICER

triggers the BLASTS on the third then the fourth silo

control and runs to the communications console reaching for
a red button on the panel -- the lettering is in Cyrillic but
it’s clearly the S0S button The com officer flips up the
plastic protector -- and pushes the button just as a BURST of
MACHINE GUN FIRE rattles out -- hitting the com officer in the
chest and finishing him

ATOP THE STAIRCASE - SAVATIER
a mute remorseless killer with a notably scarred throat

lowers his machine gun Behind him Trevelyan walks down the
metal stairs surveying it all

He is followed down by ALEXEI MAKVENIO -- a scientist who is
clearly rattled -- and a half dozen armed men Trevelyan moves
down to Victor’s body -- and removes a magnetic code key from
his pocket Alexei worried looks at the com officer’s console

ALEXEI
He’s sent out an alert to the Russian
military -- the air force will have jets
here in minutes --

TREVELYAN
Twelve
(beat)
The Nevsky is the nearest aircraft
carrier in the Siberian Sea At top speed
their Migs will arrive in twelve minutes

Trevelyan walks to the vault door -- and inserts the key
TREVELYAN
Which should be just about on time --
correct Alexei
The vault door opens revealing

THE TEMPEST CONTROL CENTER - A SMALL ROOM

filled with electronics -- notably three monitors and a
cryptography computer about the size of a laptop housed in the

control center Trevelyan turns to Alexei

TREVELYAN
Now - let’s see if your brainchild works

Alexei runs to the system and turns it on hurriedly
efficiently punching in the codes -- and --

IN OUTER SPACE - TEMPEST ONE

A satelite that’s been dummied up to look -- and broadcast --
like a simple communications satelite -- gets its wakeup call

On receiving the go code the satelite blows off its panels --
stops its broadcasts - and the core machinery that emerges
fans out a group of panels into a conical shape

AT THE TEMPEST COMPUTER - THE DISPLAY SCREEN

fills with two lines the location of the satelite in latitude
and longitude and a blank entry for the primary target

ALEXEI
(relieved excited)
It’s responding --

TREVELYAN
Then enter the target for today

Alexei looks afraid -- but this is not open to debate --

TREVELYAN
Nine minutes Alexei

Alexei punches in codes -- and a new targeting parameter of
longitude and latitude under the location --

IN OUTER SPACE - THE TEMPEST ONE

fires compressed gas jets -- and it purposefully steers toward
its destination --

IN THE CONTROL ROOM - THE TEMPEST LAPTOP SCREEN
shows this display

LOCATION 803116017
PRIMARY TARGET 780810758

But the location of the satelite is changing -- and the
display tracks with it as the numbers start to match that of
the target

EXT SIBERIAN SEA - AIRCRAFT CARRIER NEVSKY

As predicted by Trevelyan a quartet of Migs have been scrambled
- the last of the four SCREAMS in takeoff from the deck and
joins the formation to jet toward Severnaya --

INT SEVERNAYA STATION - TEMPEST CONTROL ROOM

Alexei quickly -- but carefully -- unfastens the switches that
hold the Tempest laptop in the docking station As he removes
it its display still works on battery power

LOCATION 791212462
PRIMARY TARGET 780810715

-— and the location number turns over at an amazing pace --
IN OUTER SPACE - THE TEMPEST ONE

silently streaks with missile like speed toward the target -—-
OVER THE ARCTIC ICE - THE SOVIET MIGS

BLAST over the Arctic -- and send out a threateningly toned
radio call in Russian --

AT THE BASE -— THE HELICOPTERS

are boarded by Trevelyan Savatier and Alexei -- the insistent
call from the Migs is repeated -- and unanswered Alexei glances
between the radio and the Tempest computer

As the helicopters take off Alexei’s eyes are fixed on
THE TEMPEST TRACKING SCREEN

- the numbers are locking into place like a slot machine about
to hit one hell of a jackpot --

LOCATION 780811439
PRIMARY TARGET 780810715

PILOT POV - THE SOVIET MIGS

TEAR the sky at top speed -- the base and the helicopters are
distant dots on the horizon -- the lead airman abandons the
radio -- and activates the heads-up display of the missile

firing system --
INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - COCKPIT POV

shows the jets are approaching fast Alexei is still unnerved
Trevelyan is unnervingly caln

TREVELYAN
(to pilot)
Activate shielding

OUTSIDE THE HELICOPTERS - THE COCKPITS

and every other exposed part of the copters are covered with a
mechanically lowered louvred shielding -- of the same finish
as the rest of the helicopter The odd design is starting to
make sense -- we go --

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

which is now sealed off -- the pilot is flying on instruments
alone -- Trevelyan turns to a shaken Alexei who’s sweating as
if he were in the Sahara rather than the Arctic

TREVELYAN

In the moments before the first atomic
explosion Oppenheimer was afraid too

(beat)
He was afraid he’d set the atmosphere of
the entire world on fire

(amused)
What are you afraid of at this moment
Alexei

Alexei is focused down on --
THE SCREEN - THE NUMBERS
are practically locked into place -- only seconds remain --

LOCATION 780810793
PRIMARY TARGET 780810715

WIDE SHOT OF ARCTIC SKY - THE MIGS AND THE HELICOPTERS

are clearly on a collision course --

INSIDE THE LEAD SOVIET MIG - PILOT POV

The pilot locks his missile targeting system on the
helicopters and is about to fire --

TIGHT ON TEMPEST COMPUTER SCREEN

as the final numbers lock into place location and
primary target now have the same numbers --

IN OUTER SPACE - THE TEMPEST ONE SATELITE

stabilizes its position -- points the cone of the shape charge
down to Earth -- and EXPLODES in a blindingly bright yet
totally silent blast --

WIDE SHOT OVER THE ARCTIC - THE DETONATION

is anything but silent closer to Earth -- and it almost looks
as if the sky has been set ablaze it’s lit up with the
sheer force of it which looks sounds and feels like a
thousand bolts of lightning --

CLOSE ON THE SOVIET MIGS

which are struck by the effects of the blast -- their jets stop
WHIRRING -- they stop period --

INSIDE ONE MIG

as the pilot pushes the missile firing button -- all of his
electronics short out and totally fail the heads-up

system blanks the controls won’t respond -- at the same time --
CLOSE ON THE HELICOPTERS

The effects of the blast that have crippled the Migs have zero
effect on the helicopters -- a blue flash SIZZLES harmlessly
around the helicopter’s shielding --

INSIDE THE HELICOPTERS

-- but that’s it -- the electronics inside these aircraft are
working just fine -- but elsewhere --

OUTSIDE THE SEVERNAYA STATION - THE RADAR ANTENNA

is destroyed as the detonation shorts out the electronic
equipment starting electrical fires that engulf the dish --

INSIDE THE SEVERNAYA STATION
The effects of the blast are totally felt here -- computers
spark and EXPLODE -- notably including the Tempest control

room -- within seconds the base is filled with fire --

WIDER SHOT ON THE ARCTIC - THE MIGS AND THE HELICOPTERS

The Migs with no operational systems at all drop out of the
sky as randomly and soundlessly as toy gliders -- and EXPLODE
into fireballs one after another cartwheeling on the ice --

-- as Trevelyan’s helicopters peacefully fly over the wreckage
The louvre shielding retracts --

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - FREVELYAN

looks out the window at the burning Migs -- and back at the
fireball of the Severnaya base -- as he takes the Tempest
computer from Alexei and puts it in a padded case Alexei’s face
is a blend of wonder and horror at what he’s created --

TREVELYAN
Congratulations Alexei
(contented smile)
Now let’s set the world on fire

WIDE SHOT ON THE ARCTIC

as the helicopters fly into the new dawn leaving the wreckage
and fire of the Tempest behind them

INT CHALET - PARIS - MORNING

In a well kept Paris chalet PETER a fit handsome Russian
man is in the open kitchen making two capuccinos We notice
here that the chalet is crowded with elaborate computers and
electronics -- apparently Peter’s field It’s also clearly the
morning after a very successful night before Billie Holliday is
on the stereo and the shower can be heard running in the
background -- but the real tipoff that Peter just had a night of
spectacular sex is the silly grin frozen on his face

XENIA (0S)
(from shower beckoning)

Peter --

PETER
Yes Xenia --

XENIA

(laughing)
I need you to wash my back please --

Peter giddy brings a tray with the cappucinos into the
bathroom and rests them on the sink as he takes off his
bathrobe and gets into the shower Inside the shower --

XENIA
waits laughing wet She is breathtaking with the kind of

beauty every man wants -- the kind every man fears And she
seems to want Peter as much as he wants her
a PETER

(smug)

Is that al you need darling
XENIA

(laughs)
Perhaps you can wash my front as well --

TIGHT ON THEIR FACES

Peter kisses Xenia and starts to do exactly that for a moment --

but Xenia breaks off the kiss suddenly teasingly --

XENIA
(smiling)
Peter -- you dg love me
He nods and tries to get back to business -- but --
XENIA

(teasing but insistent)
Then say it please -
PETER
(so happy he means it)

EXT LOS ANGELES - NEAR BURBANK - NIGHT

In a pouring rain just after rush hour traffic a gold Mercedes
560SL turns off Cahuenga and onto Mullholland to start the
serpentine upward As her car turns left --

-- a four wheel drive Ford Bronco starts its engine and
smoothly pulls in behind her

INSIDE THE MERCEDES - A RUSSIAN WOMAN

in her fifties names SASHA drives a little uncertainly on the
dark slick road -- she takesa pair of eyeglasses off of the
“PACIFITECH binders on the seat next to her -- as she puts them
on we see before she does that the HEADLIGHTS of the Bronco
behind her are coming up way too close way too fast --

OUTSIDE THE MERCEDES - THE BRONCO

slams into the back of the Mercedes with a frightening CRUNCH
fishtailing the rear end near the edge of a curve --

INSIDE THE MERCEDES SASHA

is terrified and thrown forward by the impact -- she accelerates
and tries to get ahead -- but the road is too winding and too
wet for her to really get moving --

the car is slammed again -- Sasha SCREAMS this time and
tries to regain control -- but she hasn’t got a chance --

ON THE ROAD

-- The Bronco hangs back and gets enough room to accelerate
and ram the Mercedes a third deadly time -- with the IMPACT of
this blow the Mercedes sails off the edge of Mulholland at
the edge of Overlook Park -

-- as it does the Bronco goes forward as if nothing happened --
INSIDE THE BRONCO - SAVATIER

is the driver -- and he doesn’t even bother to look back at the
SOUND of the explosion or the way the night is briefly lit up
by the FIREBALL He just keeps driving

Waiting at the steps of an expensive restaurant are a
well-dressed Russian couple in their 60s ANATOLY and his wife
LARISA a little giddy from the wine they had with dinner They
seem to be an older couple that’s still very much in love A
VALET brings up their Jaguar sedan -- and after stepping out of
the driver’s seat the valet moves to open the door for Larisa
With a flourish Anatoly moves in to open the door instead --
and Larisa gets in

As Anatoly walks behind the car to get in the driver’s seat a
odd look flashes interrupts his mildly drunken grin for a moment
-- but just for a split second -- as --
ON THE PASSENGER SIDE - THE VALET’S GLOVED HAND

smoothly surreptitiously slides under the door handle Anatoly

just touched -- and removes something --
THE JAGUAR

roars off -- leaving the Valet behind very very carefully
putting the small item in his coat pocket

INSIDE THE JAGUAR ANATOLY

is starting to look a little grey as he drives into the city
traffic -- Larisa notices this a little alarmed --

LARISA
Anatoly -- do you want for me to drive
Anatoly shakes his head no -- and tries to clear his head -- but

he hyperventilates and loses control of the car --

THE JAGUAR

is now just idling but totally directionless -- at five miles
an hour it pulls onto the sidewalk knocking over garbage
scattering the Londoners walking there --

INSIDE THE CAR - LARISA AND ANATOLY

Larisa frantic tries to grab the steering wheel -- Anatoly
sweating and beginning seizures -- with his last clear thought
presses his middle fingertip with his thumb --

CLOSE ON FINGERTIP - A SMALL PINPRICK OF BLOOD

can be seen --

ANATOLY

knows he’s finished now -- the last thing he says seems an
inarticulate croak --

Anatoly collapses into Larisa’s lap as --

finally stops with a gentle CRASH against a lamppost the engine
still purring as passerby run up to the car

EXT ST PETERSBURG RUSSIA - CITY STREET - DAY

This street near one of the many rivers that crisscross the
city is primarily made up of apartment buildings

At the curb in front of one of them a cab pulls up -- Marina
just back from France pays the driver and takes her two
shoulder bags out heading into the building As she does ——
A REPAIR VAN ACROSS THE STREET

opens its door -- a repairman in cap and overalls takes his
toolbox out of the cab and starts across the street --

INT MARINA’S BUILDING - LOBBY

The inside of the building looks run down -- the long hallway
from the door to the elevator is dark and dingy Marina
frustrated stabs at the elevator button -- it’s not working
Resigned to the climb she takes her bags and starts for the
stairs -- but turns at the sound of the door CLANGING open --
MARINA’S POV - THE REPAIRMAN IS SILHOETTED

against the light of the doorway -- he is clearly taking a long
barrelled pistol out of his toolbox --

MARINA

is surprised -- and frightened -- she runs for the stairs and
covers the first flight in seconds even with her bags --

THE “REPAIRMAN”

doesn’t even pick up his pace -- he just keeps walking through
the hall gun in one hand toolbox in the other -—-

MARINA - RUNNING

up the stairs -- she finds the common sense to drop her bags on
the second floor as she runs up toward the third --

THE REPAIRMAN
is still just walking slowly through the hallway --
ON THE THIRD FLOOR - MARINA

is running and trying to get out her keys -- and to get the
right one -- she looks down --

MARINA’S POV - THE REPAIRMAN

has just reached the lobby by the elevator --

MARINA

finally gets the key gets to her door and opens it --

-- once inside she slams the door shut double locks it and
leans against it gasping for breath --

IN THE LOBBY - THE REPAIRMAN

smiles Puts the gun back in the toolbox Takes out a
screwdriver And adjusts the elevator call box

IN THE APARTMENT MARINA

is still panicked and breathing fast -- she coughs And coughs
again harshly Something smells wrong -- she looks at --

CLOSE ON A GAS PIPE IN THE KITCHEN

which is punctured and HISSING -- we also see that

IN THE HALLWAY OF THE THIRD FLOOR - ANOTHER PIPE

is loose HISSING out natural gas --

IN THE LOBBY - THE REPAIRMAN

finishes his adjustment Reaches in the elevator car And

punches 3 before walking back through the hallway - the
ancient elevator WHIRRS upward --

CLOSE ON TOP OF ELEVATOR - A CONTACT CHARGE
is on the roof of the elevator car -- when it gets to a certain

point it will detonate and set off the gas --

INSIDE THE APARTMENT MARINA

is really panicked now -- she can’t go out the door -- but knows
she has to do something fast -- she crosses to a window grabs
a chair and SMASHES the glass -- as --

THE ELEVATOR

reaches the second floor -- and WHIRRS upward --

IN THE APARTMENT - MARINA

has knocked away the glass -- but there are iron bars in the
window -- ordinarily these would be for her protection but now

that’s not the way it’s working out -- she struggles with a
rusty jammed release latch -- meanwhile --

ANGLE DOWN ELEVATOR SHAFT - THE ELEVATOR

is coming up fast -- and from this angle we can see the contact

detonator is right at the top of the third floor --
AT THE WINDOW - MARINA

desperately bangs the latch -- it releases at last and the iron
bars CLANG down to fall sixty feet to the alley below --

- Marina looks at the iron bars fall all the way down -- and at
the roof of the building across the alley which is twenty feet

below -- and ten feet across -- from this window Marina climbs
into the window scared out of her wits -- as --

THE ELEVATOR
arrives at the third floor with a tiny DING -- and --
- the contact charge completes its circuit and goes off --
IN THE HALLWAY THE GAS

tes in a wa of blue flame that flashes for the door --
IN THE WINDOW - MARINA
has no choice -- she jumps out as far as she can -- there is
no comfort in the derring-do here this is as terrifying a leap
as if you or I were jumping from an exploding building --
IN THE APARTMENT - THE FRONT DOOR IS BLASTED IN
by the hallway gas and the entire apartment EXPLODES --
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - THE SURGING FLAME

of the explosion rushes just over Marina’s head as she
awkwardly falls to the roof of the building next door --

- the entire t ad floor of the building blows as --

IN THE STREET - THE REPAIRMAN

is in the van unaware of Marina’s escape as he drives off

ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING - MARINA

brushes off glass and looks up at the raging fire that used to
be her home She knows there is no reason for her to stop being
afraid She now knows she is a target

his distaste -- and turns his back on him

Really 007 -- Aston Martin only makes
one hundred cars a year -- you wind up
demolishing half of them --

IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM

The room is a mixture of old and new -- the conference table and
high-backed chairs are classically British and could have come
from the nineteenth century But the array of electronics -- a
world map on one wall and a group of three videocomputer
monitors against another is from the twenty-first

Bond and Q arrive to find M preparing a pipe and seated at the
head of the table On one side of him is SIR JAMES MOLONY (50s)
consulting neurologist to the secret service -- on another is
the MINISTER OF DEFENSE

M

Sit down 007

(motions around table)
You know Sir James Molony -- our
consulting neurologist -- and the Minister
of Defense of course

(Bond nods)
Are you familiar with Anatoly Razhnov

BOND
Of course -- a Russian scientist from the
Soviet Space Weapons Directorate Defected
to England recently I understand he was
debriefing us on their space program

M
Was is correct 007 He suffered a
stroke last night at 2130 GMT
(tamps tobacco in pipe)
Sir James

Sir James Molony opens up a medical report --

MOLONY

Razhnov is alive -- if you could call it
that But he’11l never be able to hold a
pencil again much less a briefing on
space propulsion systems What’s troubling
is that --

(eyes report)
-- the stroke was artificially induced

BOND
(doesn’t miss a beat)
Neurotoxin
MOLONY

An extremely subtle one Took me four

screenings to find it Wouldn’t have

bothered looking but the last thing

Razhnov said -- in fact the last thing

he’s ever likely to say -- was --
(checks report)

-- “kaggabe

Bond tenses at the Russian phrase --

BOND
Are you certain

MOLONY
I’m afraid so

The mood in the room takes a dark turn -- the Minister however
is one step behind --

MINISTER
(exasperated)
Well Who is kaggabe

BOND

(patiently)
Russian pronunciation of KGB Minister
This type of assassination used to he
their specialty

(turns to M)
But why would the Russians try to kill him
now

M
Razhnov was about to brief us on a program
he worked on called Beurya -—- which
translates to Tempest All we got out of
him was that Tempest was a space based
offensive weapon -- with the control
center in the Russian side of the Arctic

M nods to Q -- who activates --

THE COMPUTERVIDEO MONITORS

that dominate the end of the room The far right screen fills

with the digital image of the Arctic taken from a satelite --

from this height it looks just like a white blank screen --
M

These photos were taken via satelite two
nights ago --
Q zooms the image in on the center screen CLICKING a
computer mouse-type gadget -- the digital photo loses nothing in
detail or clarity as the VIEW drops dramatically through the
black smoke and the raging fire of the Russian base

M
-- that’s what’s left of the Russian
ICBM base in the Arctic
(contemptuous1ly)
The Russian government claims that an
electrical fire started in a silo
causing a small explosion Which is --

Q
(can’t contain himself)
-- poppycock
(looks to M)
If I may

M nods -- might as well there’s no stopping him -- Q gets to
his feet and points at the screens —-

Q
In the highly unlikely event that an
electrical fire would spread from the
silos here to the control center here --

Q CLICKS the mouse - and the left screen fills with a digital
image close up of the planes’ wreckage

BOND

-- no matter how large an explosion was
caused it couldn’t possibly have
claimed these four Russian Migs half a
mile to the east

stares at the wreckage photo -- noticing something --

BOND

Pull that image back a bit Q --

(Q does)
-- that’s a tight wreckage pattern --
those planes were destroyed on im act
not in mid-air Something caused their
operating systems to fail in flight --
like -«

(adds it up)
-- an electromagnetic pulse

Q
Precisely my thoughts 007

MINISTER
(confused)
An electro -- what
(peeved)
Do you ever read my memorandums

(patiently)
When a nuclear weapon is discharged it
creates a powerful electromagnetic pulse
that totally and instantaneously
destroys all non-shielded circuitry
such as in motors computers aircraft --
virtually any electronic device

(points to photos)
Now the pattern of the destruction
indicates that such a pulse may have been
created here -- without a nuclear
detonation If the Russians have figured
out how to generate such a pulse
artificially -- particularly from outer
space --

BOND
-- it would be categorized as a first
strike weapon Minister

MINISTER
My God -

M

(gravely)
And it could be easily directed at any
NATO base -- or any major city - with
devastating consequences

(stands)
We can’t be sure if the Russian government
is lying to withold this weapon from
disarmament talks -- or if some of the old
Communist hard-liners are building up to a
power grab The stakes are far too high
for us to just sit back and watch

(crosses to Bond)
Youre booked on the next flight to
Moscow 007 Find out precisely what

sudden interest in it

EXT COUNTRYSIDE NEAR MOSCOW - TREVELYAN’S MANSION - NIGHT

This is unmistakably a home of 19th century Russian royalty -—-
the grounds and the house are as enormous as they are ornate

INT THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The interior and furnishings are equally fit for a Czar -- which
is clearly how Trevelyan views himself As we MOVE toward the
long long dining room table we see we’ve arrived at the end of
dinner -- SERVANTS are silently clearing away the dishes

Trevelyan is seated at the head of the table -- twelve
luxuriously upholstered chairs run around the rest of it Some
of the dinner guests we recognize -- Xenia Savatier Alexei --
others we don’t But this is clearly a business gathering An
American named JORDAN is finishing his report --

JORDAN
The codes are hard to come by -- and even
harder to recode -- but we’1l be ready for
firing in two days Mr Trevelyan
TREVELYAN
Excellent Well -- now that we’ve

discussed the future of the Tempest I

want to make sure that its past has been

completely swept away

(looks to Savatier)

Savatier
(as he gets up)

At the same time I’ve arranged for a

little parlor game -- just to let you know

how much I appreciate the superb work

you’ve all done

With that Savatier draws along bladed carving knife from a
wooden box on the table Trevelyan smiles A perfect host

TREVELYAN
One of the twelve chairs you‘re seated
in -- even I’m not sure which -- has a

jewelled dagger that belonged to Nicholas
II sewn into the rear cushion Whoever’s
seated in that chair gets to keep the
dagger -- which is priceless
incidentally

(casually)
While we wait to see who’s won -- if you
wouldn’t mind reporting your progress --

Savatier steps behind Xenia who is not in the least disturbed
by this game -- she holds Trevelyan’s gaze as she reports --

XENIA
Software specialist Peter Oronov suffered
a fatal heart attack in Paris

Xenia doesn’t even shiver as the cushion behind her is knifed
with a RIPPP of tearing fabric -- nothing is there - so --

Savatier moves to the next guest - MORLEY - who we recognize
as the valet -- as he confidently reports -

MORLEY
Anatoly Razhnov suffered a very timely
stroke in London --

-- RIPPPP -- and again no dagger -- Savatier moves to --

TYSON -- who has the hawk-nosed face we saw on Bond’s computer
not too long ago This gentleman is sweating a bit

TYSON
The train attack in France meant to
eliminate cryptographer Marina
Varoskaya -- failed --

Savatier does not stick his knife in the chair Trevelyan’s
face is not pleased But it is otherwise unreadable a blank

TREVELYAN
- and why is that

TYSON
(really nervous now)
-- a British agent on board -- James
Bond -- discovered my men before --

Trevelyan’s poker face is split by a slight smile

TREVELYAN

-- James Bond
(interested now)
Tell me -- did your men kill him

TYSON
(sure he’s dead now)
-- no ---

RIPPPP -- the chair is cut up -- but Tyson incredibly is
not Nor is the dagger in this cushion -- Savatier moves on

TREVELYAN
Splendid I want to see Bond once more
before he dies

Tyson who can’t believe he’s off the hook wipes his forehead
in as dignified a manner as possible The next report is from --

-- ILLYA -- the repairman who attacked Marina He seems smug
as Savatier moves behind him

ILLYA
On the second attempt -- Marina
Varoskaya was killed in an accidental
gas explosion in her home

Trevelyan lightly shakes his head -- no --
TREVELYAN

There was no sign of her body in your
elaborately arranged accidental fire
This is news to Illya The color drains from his face

TREVELYAN

Marina Varoskaya is a brilliant woman who
is no doubt used to being spied on by the
KGB You underestimated her

(quiet building anger)
She now knows she is a target She has
gone into hiding That makes her a very
significant threat to our entire
operation

ANGLE BEHIND CHAIR - SAVATIER
changes his grip on the knife to cut more than fabric --
TIGHT ON ILLYA’S EYES

which register pure animal fear - as the SOUND of the knife
PLUNGING through wood skin and bone finally comes -—-

-- and Illya is alive He turns to his right --
TYSON

has been stabbed -- we don’t see the knife or the blood just a
very surprised look on his face as he is addressed by --

TREVELYAN
Had you used trustworthy people my dear
01d colleague James Bond would never have
even been on that train And we would be
spared a great deal of trouble

Savatier withdraws the knife - which was holding Tyson up in
the chair -- and he collapses forward onto the table

Illya jumps when Savatier with one stroke RIPPPS the
fabric in his chair -- and withdraws the jewelled dagger
which he gently hands Illya as he walks away Trevelyan smiles

TREVELYAN
This is your lucky night after all

Find Marina Varoskaya And kill her We
must leave nothing to chance

Chastened Illya nods -- and we move to a --

brightly lit with lines of limousines discharging stuffy
couples in black tie past military guards --

is the most important and opulent locale for Moscow’s affairs
of state The domed ceiling towers fifty feet over the enormous
room —- and tonight the room is packed shoulder to shoulder
with an international crowd of diplomats

Right now the crowd focuses on the podium which has a banner
in Cyrillic and English celebrating PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP The
American DIPLOMAT droning at the microphone is just as subtle --

I am pleased to be here on such an
historic occasion -- as our rivalry
blossoms into friendship Peace has been

weapons -- but through the destruction

There is much much more APPLAUSE -- the American diplomat

checking out the crowd

ROMALY
So they destroy a few of the warheads that
have not been sold on black market --

-- last week we received a report of a
man in Yakutsk with an operational warhead

stored in his living room --

Bond is only half-listening to the anecdote -- he’s more
interested in what’s caught his eye - by a window is

GENERAL LEONID PUSHKIN

of the KGB’s Counterintelligence Directorate talking to a pair
of Russians who probably have a less dangerous occupation

BOND

crosses through the crowd -- and as Pushkin sees him coming he
excuses himself from his chat and walks toward Bond

PUSHKIN
So -- James Bond --

BOND
(they shake hands)
General Pushkin -

Pushkin steers Bond away from some of the crowd and toward a
refreshment table although he’s guardedly friendly he’s
clearly very suspicious of Bond’s presence

PUSHKIN
It is always a pleasure to see you under
peaceful conditions --
(wary
-- if that is what they are What can I do
for you Bond

Pushkin takes a knife and stops in front of two silver jars of

caviar -- apparently he can’t decide which to try --
BOND
Just answer one question General --

- did you initial a termination warrant
for Anatoly Razhnov

Pushkin freezes between the silver jars astonished at the
question -- Bond remains cool -

BOND
(indicates jar helpfully) -
The royal beluga is superior General
fresh from the Astrakhan coast The other
one I wouldnt feed to a koshka

Pushkin snaps out of it and smears some of the better one on a
cracker -- and is a little steamed now --

PUSHKIN
We do not kill defectors Bond -
particularly not now --

BOND
Well someone did -- someone with access
to KGB toxins
(beat)
And it happened less than a day after that
nasty bit of weather you had in the
Arctic What’s the Russian word for it

Pushkin stops in his tracks -- his face ices over completely

I am very pleased that tensions between
our countries have eased to the point that
we can have a conversation inside the
walls of the Kremlin

But I must warn you that if you pursue
this conversation any further 007 it
will be finished inside the walls of the

better caviar and walks away --

-- revealing that Xenia is a few feet away -- and she heard
this exchange

Meanwhile --

EXT AN OUTER PART OF THE PALACE BOND

walks through one of the outer bridges that links the Grand
Palace to the surrounding palaces -- the crowd is sparser here
Bond walks past a window his attention is drawn toward an outer
balcony -- his icy demeanor shattered for a moment --

BOND’S POV - TREVELYAN

is standing by a railing He turns and sees Bond —- and abruptly
ends the conversation he was engaged in smiling invitingly

TREVELYAN
Well -- James Bond

BOND

walks toward Trevelyan regaining his aplomb as he does Two
things are crystal clear One is that Bond wants to kill this
man very much The other is that it’s taking all his
self-discipline to avoid attempting it here

Trevelyan on the other hand wears the smirking armor of a man
who feels he’s already decisively vanquished his opponent

BOND
Augustus Trevelyan --

TREVELYAN

I’1l miss this particular struggle --
wont you James As Frederick the Great
once said -- Diplomacy without armaments
is like music without instruments

(points to Kremlin wall)
Now that it’s over I can tell you -- part
of my charade is that I’m buried right
over there -- three plots down from
Khrushchev Seems childish now

(offers his hand)
You are surprised to find me still alive
I suppose

BOND
More than that -- I’m delighted
(doesn’t take hand)
It’s always been a great disappointment to
me that I wasn’t able to kill you
personally

Trevleyan laughs genuinely as if this were a bon mot instead
of the very real threat it is He withdraws his hand

TREVELYAN
Don’t be ridiculous Bond It was a
schoolboy’s game that we played a long
time ago Two empires battling to change
the world The battle is over --

(gestures around)
-- and it seems to me that the world has
not changed so much for it Now men like
you and I look for new games That is all

BOND
(with quiet contempt)
Is that how you live with betrayal and
murder Trevelyan By calling it a game’

Now Trevelyan seems genuinely disappointed in Bond

TREVELYAN

That question is beneath both of us
James I might as well ask you if the
vodka martinis ever completely still the
voices of all the men youve killed

(still conversational)
or if you ever find forgiveness in the
arms of all those women for the one that
you failed to protect

(dismissing him)
My conscience is clean James Yours I
think is rather crowded

Bond’s fury is silent -- controlled -- but unmistakable --

BOND
Certainly there’s room for one more --

TREVELYAN

Please James no embarrassing bravado no
vows to kill me -- you had your

opportunity some time ago

are both tense -- albeit for different reasons --
ROMALY

You were supposed to draw out the tigers

James -- not jump-start the Cold War back

into existance --

Bond takes out a cigarette --
IN FRONT OF

BOND
I thought Trevelyan was dead

ROMALY
You were meant to The KGB faked his death
after his defection so he could run the
Active Measures directorate in secret

BOND
(lights cigarette)
Active Measures -- the KGB euphemism for

assassinations --

ROMALY
Trevelyan has planned or approved every
KGB murder for years -- but he retired
eight months ago The government granted
him honorary diplomatic status

BOND
(a very dark laugh)
Diplomatic status - for that bastard --

ROMALY
The Russians don’t like him either James
But the only time his enemies in
government seem to surface is when the ice
breaks on Moskva River in spring

THE METROPOL HOTEL - THE LIMO STOPS

door opens and Bond gets out Romaly leans out --

ROMALY

Some advice my friend -- put Trevelyan
out of your mind Find some form of
amusement

(smiles)
-- and try not to provoke any more of the
opposition -- at least until tomorrow
morning

Romaly SHUTS the door and the limousine ROARS off as Bond -- who

is clearly still agitated -- turns toward the Metropol

INT STEAM BATH - CENTRAL POOL -— NIGHT - CLOSE ON BOND

as he THRASHES through the water trying to swim off the tension
“- and we see --

THE CENTRAL

which isn’t the tiny tiled closet Westerners are used to --
this steam bath is an Olympic sized pool surrounded by marble
columns and by the walls individual steam rooms The central

ROOM OF THE METROPOL’S STEAM BATH

room is completely fogged in with steam

The only illumination is moonlight coming in through the huge
skylight over the pool and Bond is apparently alone But as he
swims --

SOMEONE ELSE’S POV MOVES THROUGH THE STEAM

and the darkness silently --

IN THE WATER - BOND SWIMS

vigorously -- he doesn’t know he has company --
SOMEONE ELSE’S POV MOVES PAST THE COLUMNS

one by one toward the opposite end of the pool and the
individual steam rooms -

IN THE WATER - BOND

reaches the same end of the pool -- if anything he’s more wound
up than before -- as he starts to get out at the pool’s end he
looks to the side --

BOND’S POV - THE STEAM BEHIND THE COLUMNS
has been stirred by the backdraft of someone walking --

BOND GETS OUT OF THE POOL

in a single motion as if he’s seen nothing -- he walks casually
toward a steam room -- but when he reaches one column --

-« Bond abruptly grabs someone’s arm in the darkness applies
a leverage hold and THROWS whoever’s there into an individual

steam room - there’s the SLAM of someone’s body hitting the
room’s far wall --

-- and Bond hasn’t even broken his stride as he plucks his
Walther from under a bathrobe on a bench -- and steps into the
smaller steam room gun in position --

But Bond halts in his tracks at the door -- surprised -- he
looks at a towel lying in a heap in the doorway -- and at --

THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROOM - XENIA

has landed on the wooden cushioned seat of the steam room She
is illuminated only by the coals of the room’s stove and some
light reflecting in from the pool Just enough to ascertain

through the steam that her body is as flawless as it is naked

XENIA
Good evening Mr Bond

Xenia is smiling comfortably -- as if her nudity makes Bond
not her the vulnerable one It’s clear from Xenia’s almost
mocking attitude that she’s accustomed to using her body to
intimidate men Even the fact that she’s been thrown into the

room doesn’t matter To her - this is foreplay

BOND MOVES INTO THE ROOM

-- and instead of handing her the towel he drapes it around his
shoulders smiling He doesn’t have the gun pointed at her
anymore -- it casually dangles from his hand as he sits down
opposite her

BOND
Well -- the face is familiar And the rest
is exquisite
(refers to towel)
Generally I don’t undress a woman until
after meeting her --

XENIA
My name is Xenia Labyakova I understand
you are asking questions about Razhnov -
and Tempest
(beat)
I came to give you a few answers

BOND
Thank you for being so forthcoming --
(beat)
-- but the name’s familiar too Xenia You
work for the Active Measures directorate

(casually)
Thoughtless of your superiors to send you
up here to kill me -- unarmed

Xenia gets up with a small laugh - and crosses to Bond
slowly -- she wants him to get a good look Bond lets her -- the
Walther still casually hanging from his hand -

XENIA
Really James -- can I call you James --
if I‘d wanted to kill you -- I wouldn’t
need one of these --

Xenia’s face is now inches from Bond’s -- one hand dips out of
view -

XENIA’S HAND

gently takes the Walther out of Bond’s grasp --

CLOSE ON BOND AND XENIA - BOND

is as unshaken as he appears -- his eyes never leave Xenia’s

nor does his smile drop -- after a long second we hear the light
RAP of the gun being placed on the wooden bench -

XENIA
-- there are six ways I can kill you --
right here -- right now --

-- Xenia’s hand comes back up -- and both her hands find their
way to Bond’s chest caressing him there -- right over his heart
-- as if she were picking the right spot --

BOND
I knew Russian training wasn’t very
good --

Bond reaches up and gently takes her hands off his chest -- the
better to grab her back and draw her closer --

BOND
-- I can think of nine at least

Bond draws her closer still into a ferocious kiss -- we --

INT BONDS METROPOL SUITE NIGHT - A TRACKING SHOT

show clothing is strewn all over the Russian antiques - as we
MOVE IN we hear but don’t see Bond and Xenia their breath
quickened a bit -- this is either before or after sex --

XENIA (0S)
There are rumors all over about Tempest --
that the government wants to erase all
traces of it --
(impatient)
now

BOND (0S)
(cool but he wants it too)
-- not yet - is it because of
disarmament

-- we pass the large bed -- Bond and Xenia aren’t in it but the
sheets make this look like the violent ward instead of a luxury
hotel --

XENIA (0S)
Yes -- NATO does not know about the weapon
-- so it is to be kept in reserve -- in
case peace does not work out --
(breathless)
-- James please -- I can’t wait --

BOND (0S)
(firm)
You’1l have to --

At a large picture window we can see it’s lightly snowing and
cold as hell - but we see it’s a lot warmer in than out as we
MOVE UP the bodies of

BOND AND XENIA - INTERTWINED

and balanced on a daybed built for one dewed with post-coital
perspiration Bond checks and replaces a bottle of Dom
Perignon in the ice bucket -- the subject of the other
conversation Xenia’s head collapses on Bond’s chest in
exhaustion

BOND
-- this has a half hour left minimun
(beat)
What do you know about the weapon

XENIA
Nothing - but the Tempest files are
stored there --

She points out the window -- the view of central Moscow includes
an ominous grey complex --

XENIA

KGB headquarters

Perhaps you could get to them

BOND’S FACE

shows this is what he’s been waiting for the other shoe has
dropped -- he plays along --

BOND
Not a chance The security’s far too
tight The entrance is triple-doored --
there’s electronic surveillance on the
roof --

XENIA
Still -- there is a way in The outer
complex is two buildings built at two
seperate times -- the first was north and
east built after Revolution --

Xenia traces an L shape with a fingernail on Bond’s chest --

XENIA
The second was built in Stalin’s time --

Correct -- The buildings do not quite join

three levels and is blocked off --

BOND
Youll show me how to get to that

XENIA
Yes -- but first --
Xenia shifts slightly over Bond --

EXT LUBYANKA STREET - KGB HEADQUARTERSLUBYANKA - DAY

The grey nameless KGB compound is situated on a busy Moscow
street - the only clue to its identity is a glimpse of the
armed olive-uniformed guards behind the smoked glass

Bond -- who is wearing a roomy rugged jacket that fits in with
the winter wear of the Muscovites around him -- walks past the
Lubyanka and crosses the street just before an electric public
streetcar CLANGS past Bond passes the nearby World of
Children store turning a corner under a pair of uniformed
traffic sentries in an elevated booth -

-- at the corner he enters the glass doors of --

THE METRO STATION - BOND

fights the flow of pedestrian traffic to the down escalator -
“on the escalator Bond casually opens a note --

THE NOTE

is palm-sized -- there is a diagram on each side -

BOND REACHES THE BOTTOM OF THE ESCALATOR

and blending with the crowd moves toward a track maintenance

door in the station’s rear -- he opens it and slips inside
unnoticed -- meanwhile --

EXT LUBYANKA STREET - XENIA

walks to the end of the block and gets inside a waiting limo --
the door is opened by --

TREVELYAN
waiting in the back seat expectantly but confidently --

TREVELYAN
Any surprises

XENIA
(smiles gets in)
Nine of them
(beat)
Otherwise everything went as planned

TREVELYAN

(shuts door)
As I told you --

(as limo drives off)
-- there are two things James Bond
cannot resist -- a beautiful woman --
and an obvious trap

(smiles)
He is always willing to try to get into
the former -- and out of the latter

ON THE METRO TRACK - BOND

emerges from a maintenance corridor onto the track itself a
hundred yards away from the platform

Bond quickly crosses the track -- glances at the diagram -- and

the LIGHTS and BELLS of a train a oach Bond KICKS in
another door - and steps through it just as the train THUNDERS
by -- meanwhile --

IN TREVELYAN’S LIMOUSINE - TREVELYAN
is extremely pleased with himself --

TREVELYAN
You gave him the directions in a note
(she nods)
The British will now be certain that the
Russians are behind the assassinations --

We cut back to --
BOND - IN A CRAWLSPACE

Bond finishes making his way to --

A NARROW UPWARD SHAFT

that cuts between the KGB buildings at the misaligned juncture
of building 1 and building 2 The floor of the shaft is
covered with debris -- Bond lightly kicks away a wandering rat
and shines a penlight up through the total darkness

The shaft looks like the botched construction job it is -- there
are loose beams near the top and the doors that were supposed
to join are hopelessly misaligned The whole thing goes up
about fifty feet -- but it’s only four feet across --

-- so Bond grips the first loose beam on a floor division -- and

starts climbing up -- as --
IN TREVELYAN’S LIMOUSINE - TREVELYAN

TREVELYAN
-- just as the Russians will be certain
that the British are trying to steal their
technology when they find your diagram on
Bond

XENIA
Suppose Bond is as skilled with the
latter -- as he was with the former

Trevelyan’s grin grows wider -- as --

IN THE SHAFT - BOND

has quickly made his way up nearly to the top of the space --
straddling the beams that line the sides he’s about forty feet

from the bottom There are metal doors -- one on each side of
the shaft -- but they’re welded shut

Now the only decision to make is which side to enter Bond takes
out what appears to be an electronic dayplanner -- but when
he flips it open and hits the small keyboard a variety of
functions come up on the menu Bond chooses THERMAL SCAN and
holds the screen against the sealed left door --

INSIDE THE HALLWAY OF BUILDING 1 - KGB OFFICE WORKERS

move in and out of doorways --

ON THE SCREEN OF THE DAYPLANNER - THERMQGRAPHIC IMAGERY
reveals the workers there --

IN THE SHAFT - BOND

turns to the other side and presses the dayplanner against that
door - there is no thermal image here --

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR IN BUILDING 2 - A STORAGE ROOM
houses a variety of office junk --
IN THE SHAFT - BOND

pockets the dayplanner -- and takes out a felt-tip pen -- he
starts to trace a line in the metal -- as he does the trail of
the acidic ink SIZZLES and CRACKS through the metal --

TREVELYAN (V0)
Six years ago we caught the Chinese
trying to get into that shaft with some
listening equipment --

IN TREVELYAN’S LIMO - TREVELYAN

TREVELYAN
-- and I convinced the Internal Security
directorate to leave the access to the
shaft open
(beat)
With a little pest control installed

IN THE SHAFT - BOND

chemically carves his way through the door - he’s halfway
through -- as --
BOND’S FOOT ON THE BEAM

triggers a pressure sensor -- and there is the SOUND of an
engine starting cranking up something from the floor -—-

BOND

knows this can’t be good news -- he flashes the light down --
AT THE SHAFT’S BOTTOM - APLEXIGLASS CYLINDER

with dimensions that match the shaft -- there’s maybe an inch
clearance on each side -- slowly moves upward -- as it does --

twin nozzles hidden among the floor’s junk spray a yellow gas
into the cylinder keeping pace with the cylinder’s rise --

-- caught the rat SQUEALS in agony not understanding why it
can’t go through the clear plexiglass as it dies --

CLOSE ON BOND

who understands far too well as the SQUEAL abruptly ends --
IN TREVELYAN’S LIMO - TREVELYAN

serenely contemplates what’s happening now -—-

TREVELYAN

It’s a deriviative of Serin

(as if wondering what the

sensation is like)
When it makes contact with the skin -- the
nervous system tears itself apart Every
time I’ve seen it used it took about four
minutes

(beat)
A very very long four minutes

BACK IN THE SHAFT - BOND

shines the penlight up over him - at the top of the shaft
there is a now-obvious groove where the cylinder seals --
definitely not a way out --

VIEW DOWN SHAFT - OVER BOND AND APPROACHING CYLINDER

The cylinder -- and pumping gas -- are halfway up -- Bond goes
back to work on the door with the acid-pen -- the door still
needs one side finished and the acid SIZZLES at what now seems
a glacial speed -- finally --

-- Bond completes tracing the door -- he braces his feet
against the beams and SHOVES --

-- and nothing happens -- it doesn’t open - Bond
desperately THROWS himself against the door -- again to no
effect --

INSIDE THE SUPPLY ROOM - TWO HUGE FILING CABINETS

block Bond’s entrance -- there is a mountain of other junk
jammed against those -- we can just hear the SOUND of

BOND DESPERATELY SLAMMING AGAINST THE DOOR
- but it’s not moving not even an centimenter -- however -
THE CYLINDER

is still moving up at a steady pace -- the nerve gas swirling
around it just below the lip of the cylinder --

ANGLE ON BOND FROM TOP OF SHAFT

The cylinder is now ten feet below Bond -- truly desperate
now Bond leaps up to the top of the shaft and grabs a rotting
top beam -- Bond swings from it - and YANKS down on it --

- the beam breaks loose -- clutching it Bond falls twenty
feet toward the cylinder --

AT THE LIP OF THE CYLINDER - BOND’S FEET

land uncertainly on the edge -- the gas swirling inches beneath
him -- but --

BOND

gets his footing -- and plants one end of the four foot length
of timber against the edge of the rising cylinder and the
other diagonally against the cut door -- the cylinder’s
upward motion starts to SHOVE the door open --

INSIDE THE STORAGE ROOM - THE FILING CABINETS

start to move -- slowly almost imperceptibly -

IN THE SHAFT - BOND

THROWS his own weight against the beam and the door as the
cylinder PUSHES up -- the cylinder’s engine GROANS with this
new strain --

THE CYLINDER’S EDGE

notably slows its progress up - which does Bond more harm
than good because the gas is still swirling up on its own --
its now almost reached his feet -- finally ---

IN THE SUPPLY ROOM - THE FILING CABINETS

move further - SCRAPING a few inches across the floor
blocked by the other junk --

IN THE SHAFT - BOND PUSHES THE DOOR OPEN

and widens the crack another inch -- just enough to squeeze

through -- Bond climbs through the crack into --

THE SUPPLY ROOM - BOND

just gets his feet out as the gas and cylinder rise past in
the shaft -- the loose beam TUMBLING down into the cylinder --

Bond shoves his way past the junk and leans against the wall
shaken He takes a deep breath of the dusty air in the supply
room The easy part is over

Bond takes off his outer jacket - revealing he’s wearing an
immaculate black jacket and tie underneath Looking more like a
high-ranking KGB official than a spy crawling out of a hole
Bond heads for the door

INT LUBYANKA INTERNAL SECURITY ROOM - DAY

Several RUSSIAN TECHNICIANS monitor the security console for the
Lubyanka compound -- at least a dozen television monitors crowd
the console along with radios telephones and a central
computer schematic of the entire compound There’s also a
flashing red light -- as a technician picks up a phone --

-- we notice one monitor which unlike the others has a fast
moving rather than stationary point of view controlled by a
technician who’s working a joystick -- we follow that POV to --

INTEXT LUBYANKA COURTYARD - DAY - A MINI-HELICOPTER

that’s about four feet across takes us through and high above
the spacious compound area -- it’s equipped with an eternally
panning surveillance camera -- and a pair of machine guns
mounted under each skid

LOWER IN THE COMPOUND - BOND

has emerged from the building and moves into the courtyard
trying to blend in with a crowd of Russians going into work -
they generally look like any other crowd of people heading into
a huge office making for a pretty surreal sight as no one takes
notice of the surveillance helicopter -- to them it’s routine

Bond is at first astonished by the mini-helicopter -- but forces
himself not to look up at it as he heads across the courtyard --
he looks back at --

THE ENTRANCE TO THE LUBYANKA COMPOUND

as the doors swing open -- moving past the third door and coming
into the courtyard is Xenia --

BOND

opts not to confront her -- in his position the least it would
earn him is a jail cell Maybe a bullet He moves toward --

THE TOWER

which is built at the end of the courtyard and nestled inside
the rear corner of one of the outer compound buildings In
contrast to the outer compound -- which is a pair of buildings
that are between fifty and seventy years old -- the tower is
clearly a newer high-tech building It’s nine stories high --
and electronic dishes ring its roof Several covered corridors
bridge the small gap between the tower and the older building it
is nearest to

Bond reaches the tower’s entrance -- and walks --
INSIDE THE TOWER’S LOBBY

which is a huge lair of black marble -- there is a central
elevator a pair of staircases on either side and enough foot
traffic to make this look like a major office building first
thing in the morning Bond walks across toward the elevator --
it touches down in the lobb

-- and Pushkin exits angrily giving an AIDE some commands
in RUSSIAN -- the aide hurries to carry them out --

-- Bond pivots as inconspicuously as possible toward the
stairs -- he briskly walks up past a large window -- where
the helicopter hovers -- its camera seems to track Bond

as he moves up -- meanwhile --

IN THE COURTYARD XENIA

walks toward the tower but is intercepted by a young KGB AGENT
who’s obviously anxious to make points with Xenia (Again bold
sentences in dialogue indicate subtitled Russian)

KGB AGENT
Xenia -- Internal Security’s reported
there’s an intruder caught in the west
trap --
(smiles)
-- want to have a look

XENIA
It’s so gruesome --
(considers smiles)

-- well -- all right
As the agent leads Xenia off --
IN THE TOWER - BOND
is at the top level -- and eying his next problem --
BOND’S POV - AN ARMORED GLASS DOUBLE-DOOR CAGE
is the entrance he has to get past -- the first door is operated
by a magnetic key card with a slot at waist level The second is

opened by a DESK ATTENDANT with a full view of the cage who is
LAUGHING his way through a telephone conversation

BOND

walks up as nonchalantly as possible -- and takes out the
dayplanner --

-- when he reaches the door Bond presses the dayplanner
against the slot - a card EXTENDS into it -- it runs keycode

combination possibilities finding the right one in three
seconds --

- the door OPENS -- and Bond steps into --
THE PLEXIGLASS TRAP

as the door SEALS shut behind him The attendant still on the
phone hasn’t noticed Bond - so Bond makes himself noticed --

BOND
(kicks door angry)
Octrivahtsah Ceychass

The attendant is startled by the kick -- and Bond’s tone -- he
rapidly hits the BUZZER that opens the door Bond stalks to the
desk as imperious and furious as a KGB genera yanks the
phone from the attendant’s hand and forcibly hangs it up

BOND
(in his face)

Razbudeet urkhny

The attendant tries to look apologetic as Bond walks away -- as
soon as Bond is out of view --

ATTENDANT
(mutters to himself)
Veb vas --

BOND MOVES INTO A CORRIDOR

that’s long and sealed -- at the end of this stretch Bond
arrives at --

THE LUBYANKA’S FILE ROOM

which is as dark dusty and enormous -- it is jam-packed with
the most important information the KGB keeps on file

The room is tri-levelled -- each level provides its own
labyrinth of shelves packed with binder The floors are built
out of cheap translucent lucite -- it’s possible to see the
shape of office workers walking around the levels above There
are some fragile looking stairs -- and a central cage elevator

BONDS FACE

looks daunted Breaking in is one thing Finding the right file
here is clearly going to be something else Meanwhile --

ELSEWHERE IN THE COMPOUND - XENIA

stands next to the KGB agent waiting smiling expectantly --
the agent thinks she’s starting to like him -

KGB AGENT
The gas is completely pumped out now --

With a BUZZ we hear a door start to SLIDE open --
XENIA’S POV ON THE SLIDING DOOR

As it opens in front of four INTERNAL SECURITY GUARDS crouched

in firing position -- we see the bottom level of the shaft Bond
escaped from There is no trace of the yellow gas -- and the
cylinder lowers completely into the ground --

-- revealing nothing at the bottom but the broken beam
ON XENIA AND THE KGB AGENT
who are both disappointed -- in different degrees --

KGB AGENT
Just a false alarm -- that beam must have
set it off

Xenia quickly stalks out -- leaving behind the agent -- as --
IN THE LUBYANKA FILE ROOM - ON THE THIRD LEVEL

Bond is pointed down a tall claustrophobic corridor of files by
a young female FILE CLERK -- as Bond walks away from her --

BOND
Spasseba

She shyly hands him a note - obviously with her number on it --
and goes back to work pushing a cart with five huge file
boxes balanced precariously on it

Bond goes to work on the shelves which are filled with binders
Finding the right one Bond pulls it down -- but it’s too light
He opens it --

-- the binder is empty Bond’s thumb riffles the inside -- the
pages have been razored out

Bond replaces the useless binder - but tries another on the
shelf This one has pages of personnel dossiers for the space
directorate One page has a photo and information on Razhnov

Bond quietly clears an area on the shelf -- and takes out the
dayplanner again This time a cover on the bottom opens

revealing a rectangular camera lens

Bond uses the keyboard to zero in on the page -- and the
computer’s screen to focus -- as -

IN ANOTHER LEVEL - THE FEMALE FILE CLERK

we saw a moment ago wheels the very heavily laden cart down a
hallway and into the spacious office of --

PUSHKIN
who is seated at a desk - the clerk brings the cart up --

FILE CLERK
As you requested General --

Pushkin gets up -- and takes the lid off one of the boxes --

FILE CLERK
-- the complete dossier on British agent
James Bond

Atop the open box stapled to a file is a very clear eight by
ten photo of Bond -- the file clerk glances down at it her
eyes WIDENING with recognition -- as -

AT THE PLEXIGLASS TRAP XENIA

bursts through the second door - the attendant is excited and
afraid as he hangs up the phone --

ATTENDANT
There is an intruder in the file room —-

XENIA
(intense)
Send for internal security --

Xenia takes a gigantic automatic pistol out of her bag without
breaking stride -- most men couldn’t hold this with two hands
but she easily grips it with one -- she chambers a round with a
distinct CLICK as she heads toward the file room -- meanwhile --

IN THE FILE ROOM - BOND

is turning pages and RECORDING information as quickly as
possible -- we see the faces of the scientists who have been

assassinated fly by -- until Bond reaches the page with --

-- Marina’s photograph and dossier information

BOND

reacts to this -- but there’s no time to reflect on it He shuts

the binder and replaces it -- and as Bond hits a key on the
dayplanner we see the phrase ENCRYPTION COMMENCING
flashing on screen -- the image of Marina’s dossier and
presumably everything else Bond has recorded turns to a sea

of computer gibberish --

Bond quickly moves toward the elevator - when he gets there -

IN THE ELEVATOR XENIA

is coming up -- she sees Bond -- and STARTS FIRING UP through
‘ the cage -- she’s almost to the top and can fire between the
bars of the cage --

BOND RUNS

as the bullets IMPACT around him kicking up dust -- instead of
heading away from the elevator he runs past the front of it --

-- and rips opens the top cage gate as he runs past breaking
the electrical circuit -- the elevator stops --

Xenia who is momentarily trapped FIRES the rest of the clip in
vain as Bond runs out of range -- but below him --

BOND’S POV THE INTERNAL SECURITY GUARDS

are running into the main entrance of the file room -- the
commander looks up and sees Bond --

BOND

runs back along the top corridor -- stops by a window -- and
takes out the dayplanner -- the screen reads ENCRYPTION
COMPLETED Bond pulls up a TRANSMIT menu and chooses
STATION MOSCOW from a long list -- as it’s activated --

IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - A LIGHT
starts to flash on the computer schematic of the building --
TECHNICIAN
He’s trying to transmit out of the
compound --

TECHNICIAN 2
60 - use it to track him --

The second technician working the helicopter joystick flies
it up and does exactly that --

BOND

stands by the window -- the screen on the dayplanner is flashing
TRANSMITTING -- as --

- the smoked glass window he’s in front of is SHATTERED by
machine gun fire from the mini-helicopter hovering there --

Bond dives away from the flying glass and bullets -- and

runs behind a row of shelves BULLETS SHREDDING PAPER behind
him as he goes --

IN THE LEVEL BENEATH BOND - THE INTERNAL SECURITY GUARDS
see the shape of Bond moving above through the translucent

floor -- the commander runs to track with him YELLING for his
men to follow him --

CLOSE ON BOND

whos running like hell through the file corridor -- looking for
a way out -- as he moves we see --

OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - THE MINI-HELICOPTER

is tracking in the same direction --

IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY COMPOUND - THE TECHNICIAN

is using the transmission signal to guide the helicopter as
gleeful as if this were a video game -- on the schematic of the
building a flashing red light is moving --

CLOSE ON BOND

running through the labyrinthine stacks -- he’s coming up on a
cul-de-sac --

IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - A TECHNICIAN
watches as the red light moves toward the end --
TECHNICIAN
(into radio)
He’s cornered as soon as he reaches the
end of that hallway --
IN THE FILE ROOM’S LOWER LEVEL - THE COMMANDER

is running under Bonds moving shape -- and MOTIONS his men to
run ahead and take position under the ceiling to fire up --

OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - THE MINI-HELICOPTER

moves ahead too -- there’s a window at this position -- so it
HOVERS there -- the camera and machine quns PIVOT around in
preparation to fire --

IN THE FILE ROOM’S LOWER LEVEL - THE INTERNAL SECURITY GUARDS
get into firing position -- and the shape above them abruptly
stops -- and all of them OPEN FIRE with a devastating
four-way FUSILLADE through the ceiling that continues as --
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW - THE MINI-HELICOPTER

also BLAZES machine gun fire through the window -- but -- the
mini-helicopter’s CAMERA ZOOMS through the shattered window --

IN INTERNAL SECURITY COMPOUND - MONITOR POV

The shape the guards were chasing is a file cart -- which
has Bond’s dayplanner open on it -- as bullets from below FLY
everywhere knocking clouds of dust off the shelves and files
we hear a small BEEP under the deafening GUNSHOTS --
-- the monitor POV ZOOMS IN close enough to read the
dayplanner’s screen as the command reads TRANSMISSION
COMPLETED -- and is replaced by SELF DESTRUCTION —-

-- “INITIATED ——

OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - THE EXPLOSION

takes out an entire corner of this floor of the Lubyanka
compound -- the BLAST sears the helicopter knocking it back
and out of control -- just as --

IN THE LOWER LEVEL - THE INTERNAL SECURITY GUARDS

scatter as the roof falls in and a cascade of flaming binders
and shelving collapses on them -- meanwhile --

BOND

is at the opposite end of the chaos where the helicopter
first shot out a window -- obviously he doubled back after
putting the dayplanner on the cart

Bond moves to the window’s narrow ledge -- and jumps above --
IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - A TECHNICIAN

is looking desperately at the monitors and sensors --

TECHNICIAN
Where is he

The other technician taps him on the shoulder -- and points out

the window for an excellent view of Bond climbing ont
roof --

ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING - BOND

sprints across to get to the front of the compound -- as --
GUARDS ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE ROOF

spot Bond - and start firing at him --

-- but as Bond keeps running he goes past an array of
communications antennas and dishes -- the bullets TEAR them to
pieces as they momentarily shield Bond -

-- Bond reaches the end of the line -- and —-

AT THE ROOF’S EDGE - BOND

stops and looks down --

BONDS POV - WORLD OF CHILDREN

is across the street -- there’s a rat trap screen three stories

up that runs the length of the building -- it might be able
to hold him --

BOND

guesses the odds of surviving a jump that’s twenty feet across
and sixty feet down into a very uncertain net -- behind him --

THE INTERNAL SECURITY GUARDS

are bolstered as several more show up through a roof entrance
led by the commander -- all point their weapons at Bond --

BOND

-- the mini-helicopter rises over the roof’s ledge -- it’s
carbonized from the explosion but still extremely
operational -- the camera and the twin machine guns track
toward Bond as it rises up -- Bond looks back to

THE OTHER END OF THE ROOF —- XENIA

emerges behind the internal security guards -- and pulls out
her automatic --

XENIA
Shoot to kill --
(commander hesitates)
To kill commander --

The commander gives the order -- the men FIRE across the roof
at Bond --

BOND LEAPS FROM THE LEDGE

directly up toward the skids of the mini-helicopter -- which
also FIRES at Bond but he’s below the line of fire --

- Bond grabs the skids of the helicopter and hangs on - the
force of Bonds leap TWISTS the copter around --

-- the mini-helicopter’s GUNFIRE forces the guards on the roof
to scatter -- and --

IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - THE WINDOW

is shattered by the GUNFIRE -- the technicians dive under
the console and grope up to turn off the machine guns --

BOND GRIPPING THE SKIDS OF THE HELICOPTER

The helicopter is now facing the street -- the force of Bond’s
weight which is far more than the copter was meant to hold has
it diving directly down the street --

XENIA

won’t give up -- she runs across the roof FIRING her automatic
down at Bond some of the bullets SPARKING off the blade --

BOND ON HELICOPTER - EIGHTY FEET UP

Bond is heading straight down the street that leads to the
Kremlin eight stories over the traffic and dropping fast -- but
by extending his legs to direct his weight and by pulling on the
skids he steers the copter like an awkward hang glider --
XENIA

empties the clip at Bond to no effect -- and hits her radio --

XENIA
Cut off the helicopter’s power --

IN THE INTERNAL SECURITY CONSOLE

The technician throws a switch that shuts off the engine -
BOND ON THE HELICOPTER

is still five stories up when the engine’s WHIRRING is
silenced -- the rotor completely STOPS and the helicopter

goes dead -

-- Bond still clutching the skids starts to fall straight
down --

-- but the rotor reverses direction and goes into

autorotation from the drag of the fall -- it slows Bond just
enough for a relatively smooth landing --

BOND TOUCHES DOWN ON A MOVING STREETCAR

tracking down the street past the Kremlin and toward the Moskva
River -- Bond gets his footing on the streetcar’s roof as the
helicopter lands in a heap next to him --

THE HELICOPTER’S CAMERA LENS

INT NEAR GORKY PARK - CHESS CAFE - DAY

This dark dusty establishment is devoted to two things
drinking thick Russian coffee and playing chess There are
several dozen players inside mostly old men contemplating each
other’s moves There’s little conversation -- what can be heard
here is low and quiet At one table --

-- Romaly is alone -- but this hasn’t stopped him from playing a
game of chess anyway He moves a black piece -- and turns the
board around After a moment -- he moves a white piece -- as --

BOND ARRIVES
and sits down As they speak they keep their voices low --

ROMALY
Your move

rd BOND

(eyes sparse black pieces)
You haven’t left me much

After looking at the board for five seconds -- Bond decisively
moves a bishop up --

ROMALY

Youre in an unwinnable position James --
I’ve been replaying the 1962 game in which
grandmaster Botvinnik was defeated by
Petrosian

(makes move)
I know I said you should wait until
morning to provoke the opposition -- but
blowing large holes in the Lubyanka is not
what I had in mind

(beat)
M is furious You understand that London
has had to tell the Russian government
youve gone rogue We’re going to have to
get you out of the country in secret as
quickly as possible

Bond makes a simple pawn move -

BOND
Did you receive my transmission
ROMALY

Yes I checked on the scientists
personally All eight of them worked in
high positions at the Soviet weapons
research complex -- Arzamas Sixteen And
all eight have died in the last week --
in apparent accidents the Russians must
have engineered

(makes move)
All but one

Bond moves a piece up -- and tries to conceal his interest -

BOND
The woman Marina Varoskaya

Romaly moves again - claiming the piece Bond just moved -- and
shakes his head Bond tries to hide a flash of disappointment

ROMALY
A gas explosion
(beat)
The only survivor is Alexei Makvenio He’s
overseeing the destruction of the nuclear
warheads in Kazakhstan

(beat)
Do you think that’s why the Russians let
him live

BOND
This isn’t a Russian operation Romaly
Pushkin had no idea the assassinations
were taking place Someone’s playing us
and the Russians off against each other

ROMALY
Such as --

BOND

(considers board)
The woman who led me into the Lubyanka
used to work for Trevelyan Perhaps she
still does

(makes move)
Trevelyan said he was looking for a new
game I think this is it

Romaly -- who was moving his pieces by rote -- now seems
thrown -- Bond’s pieces have surrounded his king --
ROMALY

That’s a very broad leap James --
(finally makes move)

-- it is a bad idea to let hatred rule

your judgement

BOND
I’1l need some documentation Romaly
Before I leave Russia -- I have to make a

side trip to Kazakhstan
Bond makes a final decisive move -- Romaly looks all over the
board for an answer that isn’t there --

BOND
If it is Trevelyan -- and it’s a game he
wants - he’s going to get one

EXT KAZAKHSTAN - GEGELEN HILLS DAWN

With the desert behind and the mountains ahead it’s clear
there’s virtually no civilization in this part of the world
outside of the atomic testing installation in the hills A
single paved road leads along the desert up to one of the
hills -- with a matching railroad track that runs parallel

The track and the road part company when you reach one of these
hills -- the track runs down to the hill’s base and a freight
entrance -- and the road runs up to a monitoring station that’s
on the hill’s top Access to both is barred by a young Russian
guard name tagged ROSSKOVITCH manning a barricade

Today there’s interest in the area -- there are a lot of cars
and trailers camped out at the checkpoint Microphones and
satelites tell us they’re the press now swarming around a NATO
SPOKESMAN reading from a statement --

NATO SPOKESMAN

In two hours Dr Alexei Makvenio of the
Russian Defense Ministry will detonate
the nuclear device which has a twenty
kiloton yield underground at a depth of
thirteen hundred feet It will effectively
destroy three hundred warheads from the
former Soviet arsenal After that -- the
testing site will be closed for good

(a reporter shouts a

question)
No -- there’s no danger the blast can set
off any of the warheads -- the explosive

triggers are in the chamber but they’re

not directly wired to the warheads --
(to another)

-- yes -- the site has been thoroughly

inspected by a United Nations team to

verify that the warheads are there --
(to another)

-- no -- the monitoring station will not

be operated -- previous blasts have made

the hillside slightly unstable --

As the expositionary din continues we notice the dust of a
four-wheel drive vehicle driving up the road --

AT THE WHEEL - MARINA

heads toward the barricade -- as she does she yanks a
pull-out car stereo from the dashboard -- puts it on the seat
next to her -- and takes a screwdriver from the glove
compartment -

AT THE BARRICADE - ROSSKOVITCH
signals for Marina to stop She lowers her window --

ROSSKOVITCH
(bored)
No press allowed inside -- park there --

Marina officiously takes out an ID card with a younger picture
of her on it -- her Arzamas Sixteen identification --

MARINA
(offended)
I am not press --
(motions to seat)
-- I am delivering the bomb’s triggering
circuitry

Rosskovitch looks down at the seat - the stereo with its back
removed is a bewildering jumble of circuitry Rosskovitch
glances in turn at the trigger the ID card and Marina’s
glowering condescending expression as she lights a cigarette --

MARINA
Do you want to let me pass -- or do you
want me to tell Dr Makvenio that -
(reads name tag)
-- private Rosskovitch thinks a nuclear
weapon should be exploded with a
firecracker’s fuse

THE BAR ACROSS THE ROAD RISES

as Rosskovitch backs up in a cloud of cigarette smoke -- and
Marina’s car moves forward toward the main hill and up to --

THE MONITORING STATION

which is a relatively simple relatively small building that’s
on the hill’s top Near it is a no-frills cage elevator that
looks like something you’d find in a mine

Marina parks her car next to the only other vehicle -- takes a
shoulder bag out of her car -- and gets into

THE ELEVATOR

We ride it down with her -- all the way down to emphasize
that we’re going half a mile into the earth At the bottom is —-

THE NUCLEAR BLAST CHAMBER’S CORRIDOR

This central circular part of the underground center is huge --
a gigantic cavern surrounded by the seared remains of other
tests in the closed shafts that spoke outward A small rail
system for handcars runs in from the side -- the only other

way out of this place -- and an inch thick Corrtex cable hangs
from a shaft drilled through the rock’s ceiling weighted by a
massive seismic sensor

Only one test shaft remains open - test chamber twelve Marina
heads toward this shaft -- smiling with relief when she sees --

MARINA
Alexei

AT THE SHAFT DOOR ALEXET

making last minute preparations for the blast turns around
color draining from his face as Marina runs up to him

MARINA
Thank God you’re still alive

Meanwhile -- back at --
THE ROAD’S BARRICADE - BOND
drives up -- and rolls his window down for Rosskovitch -

ROSSKOVITCH
No press allowed inside -- turn around
and park there --

Bond produces an authentic looking United Nations ID card for
Rosskovitch to squint at

BOND
I am not with the press -- I’m with the
inspection team

Rosskovitch motions toward the real inspection team which is
fielding questions from reporters

ROSSKOVITCH
The site has been inspected already —-

BOND

(haughty)
and my orders are to thoroughly
inspect it again -- unless --

(reads name tag)
- private Rosskovitch -- you’d like to
tell the world press what the Russian
government wants to hide from the United
Nations

Rosskovitch -- exasperated at this point -- raises the bar --
and Bond drives past up to the monitoring station
INSIDE THE TEST CHAMBER - MARINA AND ALEXEI

Marina is wrapping up an animated explanation Alexei for his
part is obviously rattled by Marina’s presence not the story

MARINA
I checked Alexei Except for us
everyone who worked on the Tempest
program at Arzamas Sixteen has been
killed Theyve tried to get me twice

already

ALEXEI
If this is true Marina -- what can we
do

MARINA

There’s only one thing we can do --

She pulls out a diskette from her shoulder bag - which also
contains her computer

MARINA
There’s are reporters out there from all
over the world I’ve reconstructed enough
of the project data on this disk that you
and I can convince them that the weapon
exists With disarmament going on the
government will have to shut Tempest
down It’s the only way well both be
safe

Alexei pauses and doesn’t answer Doubt -- and a little
shame -- flicker across his face ---as --

-- from behind Marina gets a devastating crack on the back of
the head and crumples to the ground unconscious

FROM OUT OF THE TEST CHAMBER ILLYA

emerges with a machine gun wearing a Russian military uniform
and a satisfied expression Alexei looks down ashen as Illya
picks up the diskette

ILLYA
Trevelyan was right --
(snaps disk in half)
-- she did want to protect her old mentor

UP IN THE MONITORING STATION BOND

walks into the trailer where the monitoring equipment --
thermographic computers and the other end of the Corrtex cable
housed in a cylinder with a spool over it -- lays idle Ona
chair in front of one of the consoles is a jacket -- and a
briefcase Bond opens the case and rifles through it

Except for the fact that most of the documents are in Cyrillic
this looks pretty ordinary

H

Bond’s blank expression tells us there are no documents of
importance here -- he shuts the case and puts it back where he
found it But as he does -- something grabs his attention --

BOND’S POV - ON THE HANDLE
of the case -- one end of it bulges in an unusual way

Bond rips open the seam on the handle revealing the core of the
handle is a simple small ivory object with a design carved

into one end Nothing high tech at all But even though we have
no idea what this thing is Bond’s expression reveals he knows
exactly what it is -- and what it’s for Meanwhile —-

OWN IN ST CHAMB TWELVE - CLOSE ON MARINA’S LIMP BODY

being dropped by Illya into an empty coffin-sized bomb casing
cylinder Illya CLANGS the cylinder shut --

ILLYA
Don’t worry Makvenio -- she’s alive --

ALEXEI AND ILLYA - BY THE CYLINDER

Alexei looks sickened as Illya seals the cylinder shut with a
locking pin -- Illya is amused at Alexei’s squeamishness

ILLYA
-- at least until your bomb goes off

WIDE ON THE TEST CHAMBER ITSELF

We see the cylinder is on the handcart halfway down the test
shaft itself The entrance from the main chamber is about
seventy feet across -- the widest point As it moves down a
steep forty-five degree slope the chamber narrows as it gets
closer to the end about seventy five yards down where the
chamber is only six inches across Here is where the bomb --
and its timer -- is housed

The chamber is also notably segmented into five zones
seperated by irising blast doors that are at least four

inches thick and now open -- and a small cargo rail system runs
down the center of it

The other thing we notice about the chamber is that there are

three hundred atomic warheads inside -- some casings eight
feet long some shorter all neatly stacked horizontally like
cordwood in the wider parts of the chamber held back from

tumbling down the chamber by a network of steel chains

The chamber suddenly ECHOES with the GRIND of the elevator in
the outer chamber as Alexei and Illya move the casing with
Marina in with the other warheads Illya glares at Alexei --

ILLYA
Expecting anyone else

Alexei anxiously moves up to the main chamber --

IN THE MAIN CHAMBER - BOND
gets out of the elevator in a smock and with a clipboard --

BOND
Dr Makvenio
(arrogant)
I’ve come to talk about your rather
obvious attempt to misuse Russian military
technology

Alexei is all innocent surprise as he approaches Bond --

ALEXET
To what are you referring Doctor --

IN THE TEST CHAMBER - ILLYA

is behind one of the warhead clusters -- he slams the bolt
back on his machine gun --

BOND (0S)
Dr Burton I’m afraid you know perfectly
well what I’m talking about Dr Makvenio

BOND AND ALEXEI

head toward the chamber Bond essentially bulldozing his way in
Alexei trailing behind

BOND
The United Nations has learned that the
Russian government plans to detonate a
much larger nuclear device than approved
-- so you can monitor the information for
new weapons research

They reach the inside of the chamber -- Alexei tries to steer
him out but this only persuades Bond to press on -

ALEXEI

That’s ridiculous Dr Burton we have a
Corrtex seismic measurement for
verification purposes as you see but --

(points to computers)
-- the thermographic computers have been
disconnected We will receive no
developmental data from the explosion

Bond eyes the chamber with renewed interest as they move down --

BOND
-- and the blast doors Makvenio
ALEXEI
(concedes)
Well -- the chamber was designed for
weapons research -- it just has not been

used until now
ALEXEI

The doors were meant to stifle the
detonation at different levels

as they walk down)
The top zone would simulate a thirty mile
distance from the blast -- relative safety
-- this area simulates a ten mile distance
-- total devastation -- and this zone
would be three miles from the blast --

BOND
-- total incineration

Bond’s mask slips a notch as he considers --

BOND
You’re simulating the effects of a nuclear
blast at thirty miles -- in a conical

chamber for a shaped detonation --

(it clicks into place)
-- which enhances the effect of an
electromagnetic pulse That principle
transfers nicely into satelite weaponry
doesn’t it Doctor

(drops act draws gun)
Trevelyan must have paid you handsomely
for it Now let’s have a talk with --

There is a SOUND behind Bond -- he whirls but is too late --
Illya comes from behind one of the warhead casings and smashes
the back of Bond’s head with his machine gun

Bond collapses to the ground nearly unconscious -- Illya bends
down and takes Bond’s gun

ILLYA
I don’t want any more surprises Makvenio
Set the bomb to go off early

ALEXEI
But --

ILLYA
But what The Russians will fire you In
two days you’1l be able to buy half of
Moscow And your cover is already blown
(motions with gun)
Move Give us thirty minutes to get out

As Alexei moves down to the bottom where the bomb is housed in
the wall -- Bond starts to stir Illya is enjoying himself

ILLYA
So this is James Bond I can’t say I’m
impressed
AT “GROUND ZERO - ALEXEI
is at the bomb’s control panel -- he runs a magnetic keycard

through it then enters a code combination into a keypad --
IN LEVEL TWO - BOND AND ALEXEI
Bond sits up -- looks at Illya --

BOND

Illya Borchenko isn’t it

(he nods)
Haven’t heard anything about you since you
botched that Stasi job in Zagreb

(rubbing it in)
Trevelyan must be hard up for help to put
a cockup artist like you back to work

This hits a nerve -- Illya savagely kicks Bond in the face
forcing him back --

ILLYA
You look pretty clever down there Bond --
(steadies gun)
-- but in half an hour I11 be on my way
to St Petersburg -- and you’ll be
bleeding to death in the middle of ground
zero --

Illya aims the machine gun down at Bond’s legs --
CLOSE ON BOND’S HAND - AN IRON BAR

from the rail’s handcart is a centimeter away -- Bond’s grip
closes around it --

BOND AND ILLYA - LEVEL TWO

As Illya aims down and pulls the trigger - Bond swings the
bar up against Illya’s arm -- a BURST of machine gun fire goes
wild down the chamber’s center --

TIGHT ON ALEXEI’S FACE

which clenches in a terminal expression -- some of the bullets
have caught him in the back -- he collapses and sinks
down -- dead --

CLOSE ON THE BOMB’S CONTROLS

which have been spattered with Alexei’s blood -- as Alexei’s
hand slides off the keypad we can see he wasn’t able to enter

the last zero in 300000 -- the timer reads 30000 as
Alexei’s hand slides off and hits an initiator button --

-- the timer races down from three minutes in one-hundredth
second increments -- 25900 - 25800 - as --

FURTHER UP - BOND AND ILLYA

Bond slams Illya again with the bar knocking him onto the
handcart —- Bond swings the bar at the brake and the cart
runs down the rail - Illya is on his back but still FIRES his
machine gun up at Bond as the cart tracks down -- meanwhile --

INSIDE THE EMPTY CASING - MARINA

is awakened by the GUNFIRE -- she desperately starts banging
on the inside of the casing trying to get out -- as --

BOND

ducks behind the warhead casings -- Illya’s BULLETS ricochet
all over the warheads -- as Bond crosses up one level sticking
close to the warheads for cover we see -

ONE OF THE WARHEADS SIZZLING AND SPARKING

where it was struck by qgunfire -- there’s no risk of a nuclear
blast here but these still have high e osive tri

BY A CHAIN BARRIER - BOND

runs up through the third level -- above the blast door there
is a flashing red Cyrillic warning -- and a timer reading
24000 -- 13900 --

-- Bond realizes he has to get out of there fast - and starts
to run up the rest of the way -- but hears a banging in one of
the warhead groupings --

- Bond pauses trying to figure out which cylinder it’s coming
from -- when he finds the right one which is standing upright
and pulls a release pin he looks in astonished and pleased --

BOND
Youre alive --

THE CASING OPENS — MARINA

is inside -- and recognizes Bond -- frightened as she is she
actually looks more angry -- —

MARINA
(with hatred)
Keep trying -- ty negodiay --

Marina grabs the top of the casing - and bracing against it
she give Bond a powerful kick in the stomach --

BOND

wasn’t quite expecting this -- he reels back toward the rail
line of the chamber --

-- and subsequently into Illya’s line of fire -- BULLETS
stitch around the concrete and the warheads --

ILLYA
is running up the slanted path a level down from Bond --
BOND

dives back into the opposite warhead grouping for cover --

ON BOMB’S COUNTDOWN CLOCK

-- 05000 -- 04900 -- meanwhile --

MARINA

weaves up and through the maze of warhead groupings -- and

runs out of the top level to safety - as she runs out she
hits a button on a top level control panel -- and --

THE FIRST BLAST DOOR

at the chamber’s bottom irises shut in front of the bomb --

BEHIND THE OPPOSITE GROUP OF WARHEADS LEVEL THREE - BOND

is pinned as Illya comes up -- there’s nowhere for him to go up
or down -- the warheads are too densely packed here --

BONDS POV - THROUGH WARHEAD CASINGS ILLYA
is moving up to a position where he can shoot Bond -- as -

ON LEVEL TWO - THE SECOND BLAST DOOR

irises shut with an irreversible CLANG easily crushing the
handcart that was lying in its path as if it were made of
cardboard instead of steel -- as --

ILLYA’S POV - THROUGH WARHEAD CASINGS - BOND

is visible --

ON LEVEL THREE ILLYA

smiles and prepares to shoot Bond -- but just above them --

ON LEVEL FOUR - THE WARHEAD

that was SPARKING actually ignites an electrical fire -- the
high explosive trigger detonates --

-- the explosion SNAPS the chain that holds the warheads’
cylinders in place -- the warheads roll loose in an
avalanche breaking the chain of the grouping opposite them --

-- over a hundred nuclear warheads cascade down toward the
third level --

ON LEVEL THREE - BOND
lunges out at Illya knocking him back and away as the

warheads rol down their impact SNAPPING the chains t that hold

this level’s warheads -- as Bond struggles with Illya we see --

THE BOMB’S TIMER
races down -- 02500 -- 02400 --

ON LEVEL THREE - BOND AND ILLYA

-- Bond slams Illya back and away as above them the third
blast door -- the only avenue of escape -- starts to iris
shut -- Bond runs up toward it --

-- Illya is stuck on the rolling tide of missiles moving down --
but he still FIRES up at Bond --

-- bullets SPARK against the missiles that roll past Bond more
SHOTS impact on the closing blast door -- he’s running like
hell but he’s not even close to --

THE THIRD BLAST DOOR

which knocks away some rolling warheads as it closes -- it
momentarily jams on one of the casings -- just as the door
GRINDS shoving the casing loose closing in --

Bond dives through the hole and to the other side -
BULLETS still streaking past him as he dives --

ON LEVEL FOUR - BOND

hits the floor in a roll getting out of the way of a falling
warhead casing that BOOMS to the concrete nearly crushing him
-- he gets his footing and continues to run up the slanting
floor serpentining and dodging around the rolling missiles -
which is suddenly made more difficult as all the pyrotechnics in
here have the lights winking out --

BOND’S POV - THE FOURTH BLAST DOOR

is irising to a close -- and the timer mounted above it is
finishing too -- 00500 -- 00400 -- 00300 --

ON BOND RACING UP THE SLANTED FLOOR
Bond pours it on -- the gap is just under manhole size as
BOND DIVES THROUGH THE BLAST DOOR HEAD FIRST

as it CLANGS shut right after him -- instead of bracing to land
Bond cups his hands on his ears -- before he hits the floor --

THE BOMB’S TIMER
hits 00000 -- the screen fills with a BLINDING explosion --
NUCLEAR EXPLOSION POV - THE BLAST

tears through the first two doors in an almost unimaginable
fury of flame --

Illya has a tenth of a second to react to the SOUND of the
doors being torn apart -- before he can complete his turn or

start his scream Illya’s qun melts as he’s vaporized against
the third blast wall -- and it too is demolished --

IN LEVEL FIVE -— BOND
is still rolling from his leap the ground shaking under him

his hands over his ears from the DEAFENING blast -- he stares at
the outer blast door --
-- there is a SIZZLING molten sound from inside the

chamber -- the other side of the door is probably slag -- but
it’s held

Bond staggers out into the central chamber -- as
OUTSIDE THE HILL - MARINA

completes her run stumbling out of the hill’s freight entrance
She’s safe -- but the ground is stil shaking --

BOND

can feel it too as he moves out into the central chamber -- and
finds he’s not out of it yet -- he looks up --

BOND’S POV - THE CENTRAL CHAMBER’S CEILING IS CAVING IN
from the blast -- rocks are shearing off everywhere ——

Bond looks to the elevator -- it crumiples under the weight
of a cave-in --

-- Bond turns to the freight entrance -- but the tunnel to the
rail line also collapses from underneath -- the floor of the
chamber is opening too in a web of widening fissures --

BOND

looks around desperately -- there’s no way out -- but his eyes
lock in one direction -- and

BOND RUNS ACROSS THE CHAMBER

as the ceiling literally falls in around him and the floor
opens up underneath him -- one fissure is opening behind Bond’s
heels as he reaches the Corrtex seismic cable and jumps on top
of the sensor’s weight grabbing the cable with one hand and

pulling the connecting pin under his feet with another --
the weight drops off into the splitting floor -- as --

-- Bond hangs on to the cable standing on the small disk that
anchored the cable to the weight as the release of the weight’s
tension sends the cable reeling back to its spool --

BOND’S POV - THE CABLE
is swinging dangerously as it shoots up toward the rock

ceiling above - as rocks continue to fall around him the cable
is drawn into the metal pipe --

-- the inside of the pipe’s shaft rushes past Bond -- the only
light in here is the violent SPARKING of the disk scraping

against the inside of the pipe -- until finally -- there’s a
crack of light at the top of the shaft -—-
BOND ON THE CABLE

Bond braces as the cable roughly brakes and comes to a halt at
the top --

INSIDE THE MONITORING STATION ON THE HILLTOP - BOND

kicks open the door that houses the Corrtex cable -- and starts
out -- but the last thing he sees as he moves out is --

BOND’S POV - THE RIFLE BUTT OF ROSSKOVITCH

dropping like a drill press against Bond’s forehead -- and we
drop to --

BLACK SCREEN - THE HIGH-PITCHED WHINE OF A BUZZSAW

This annoying sound brings us back to --
BONDS POV - OUT HELICOPTER DOOR - THE URAL MOUNTAINS

are below -- beneath one of the mountains is a forest that’s
being assualted by a logging camp at the base of a river

complete with a timber mill and a small helicopter wielding a
dangli twelve foot rack of circular saws
BOND

groggy wakes up - something dark etched into his face shows he
recognizes this spot Bond is in a troop transport helicopter

in flight his hands cuffed through a bar over his head Ahead
in the cockpit a PILOT radios something in Russian -- we can’t
tell what’s being said but we do catch the word Pushkin

Sitting on a bench opposite Bond is Rosskovitch whose scowl
tells us he was chewed out for letting Bond through Next to
Bond is another Russian guard -- and sitting on the other side
of the guard is Marina also cuffed and now glaring at Bond

MARINA
(with hatred)
How many did you kill

BOND
I didn’t kill any of them Marina
Listen to me -- you’re still in danger
The control to Tempest has been stolen
from the Russians --

Rosskovitch gives Bond a warning kick to shut him up --

L x ROSSKOVITCH
Zatkneis --

BOND
I don’t think the Russians know how to
deactivate it -- and the Americans don’t
even know it exists --

Marina is rightly skeptical of Bond --

MARINA
Why should I believe you

The other Russian guard turns to Marina--

GUARD
(threatening)
Nyet Zatkneis --

Bond is frustrated - he knows there’s no reason she should
trust him but he has to convince her --

BOND
Believe anything you like -- but I just
heard them send for General Pushkin
They’re taking us to a safehouse for
interrogation Whatever happens tell them

how to shut the damned thing down --

The guard points a rifle threateningly in Marina’s face --
Bond kicks it away -- and the guard savagely slams Bonds
head with his rifle

Marina weighs Bond’s words -- as the helicopter reaches --
THE MOUNTAIN’S SUMMIT - A HUGE COUNTRY HOUSE

that’s three stories high is on the snowy mountaintop
surrounded by a forest that runs down the mountainside Near
the house is a frozen lake that is thawing -- the steep river
that flows down from the lake is fed from this -- a chunk of ice
breaks away from the lake and smashes down the rapids as the
helicopter touches down and is surrounded by RUSSIAN GUARDS

BOND
tumbles back into unconsciousness -- as we --

DISSOLVE TO
VIEW OF MOUNTAIN AND COUNTRY HOUSE - LOW POV - NIGHT
Something is off-kilter here -- this is the same mountain and
country house but we can see this isn’t the present because
it’s a different season -- there’s no snow no ice The POV of
the house lit up from inside is from behind several trees --
it belongs to
A YOUNGER BOND
who is in a camoflage outfit armed with a sniper’s rifle and

commando gear -- there are two other agents with him -- 003 a
man and 005 a woman -- but it’s clear that Bond is in charge

He signals for them to wait -- as he raises his binoculars --
BINOCULAR POV OF HOUSE - THROUGH A PICTURE WINDOW

Trevelyan -- also looking younger -- is inside a salon that
looks pretty comfortable except for the fact that he’s
surrounded by armed Russians -- and hooked up to a polygraph
Trevelyan looks nervous --

BOND

lowers the binoculars -- and gestures for the others to approach
the house at different angles --

WIDER ANGLE ON THE FOREST

as Bond and the other Double-Ohs move up through the treeline
staying low to the ground --

-- we move back to Bond -- who is creeping along another group
of wild strawberry bushes -- his eyes fixed on --

BOND’S POV - THE HOUSE’S SALON WINDOW

Trevelyan is removed from the polygraph’s wiring - and is
roughly shoved out of the room by the Russian guards --

BOND

fixes his position low on a ridge - and readies his sniper
rifle waiting -- as he does he nonchalantly picks one of the
strawberries and pops it in his mouth --

003 AND 005

move up too -- belly-crawling seperately through a flat wide
patch of strawberries --

AT THE HOUSE’S DOOR TREVELYAN

is handcuffed and accompanied by two guards -- who shove him
toward a transport truck to be taken elsewhere --

BOND
fixes his eye on the scope - his finger on the trigger --
NIGHTSCOPE POV - THE CROSSHAIRS

are on Trevelyan as he’s moved through -- he and the Russian
guards are right next to the truck --

CLOSE ON BOND’S FACE

as he hesitates -- his finger frozen on the trigger -- he
makes a decision --

NIGHTSCOPE POV THE CROSSHAIRS

shift from Trevelyan to one of the Russian guards -- Bond
fires and the guard falls -- the crosshairs move rapidly to
the other Russian guard who Bond also kills --

-- leaving Trevelyan standing frozen --

BOND
lowers the rifle -- knows there’s only seconds -- and takes out
a flashlight -- he flashes it twice at Trevelyan --

TREVELYAN’S FACE

is briefly illuminated by the light -- he bends down and takes a
gun from one of the guards -- he starts running forward --

-- but he stops at the truck’s cab -- he reaches in and turns
on the headlights which are aimed directly at --

BOND’S POSITION

which is completely illuminated -- as is his astonished look
of betrayal -

-- other Russian guards fire at Bond -- Bond dives back under

the ridge as it’s chewed by machine qun fire -

WIDE ON ENTIRE AREA AS FLOODLIGHTS ILLUMINATE THE FOREST
eaving 003 and 005 totally exposed and surrounded --

TREVELYAN

takes the machine gun and fires at 003 and 005 --

003 AND 005

are cut to pieces by the machine gun fire -- both fall dead
in their tracks in the strawberry field --

BOND
is driven back surrounded by gunfire from the guards -- he’s
forced to run through the forest to a position of safety -- from
behind a tree he takes his binoculars and looks up --

NOCULAR POV - TREVELYAN DA RUSST GENERAL

seem pretty chummy as the General takes off Trevelyan’s
handcuffs --

BOND

lowers the binoculars -- revealing that the shock of betrayal
has given way to hatred

Bond runs down and into the night as the CRACK of a gunshot
just misses Bond filling the screen with blinding LIGHT --

SMASH CUT TO
A CEILING PAINTING - A GROUP OF RUSSIAN NOBLES
are dancing around what appears to be a realistic balcony --
IN A GUEST ROOM - BOND

wakes up abruptly where he’s been dumped in a chair his hands
cuffed around a short marble column near a window It’s
mid-afternoon The room is a nicely furnished part of this
Russian safehouse Obviously it’s meant to hold the better class
of prisoner -- but it is unmistakably a prison

Bond looks around shaking off the past and moving into the
present He is more or less comfortably seated in the chair but
cuffed to the column he is immobile He’s right next to a
picture window -- but the flecks of metal in the glass tell us
this is armored glass Bond looks out the window -- there’s a
second-story view of --

THE FROZEN LAKE

And at the opposite end of the lake - a battered single-engine
seaplane is tied to a dock on the ice

BOND

plants his feet on the throw rug of the floor -- and uses it to
drag over the wire screen in front of the fireplace

INT COUNTRY HOUSE - SALON - DAY

This is the same room we saw earlier -- nicely furnished a fire
roaring in the fireplace a huge picture window overlooking the
lake and the rest of the grounds

But the room has some menacing fixtures as well The room is
attractively soundproofed -- the picture window’s glass is
armored -- a teacart holds a tray with drugs and syringes -- and
behind a couch is a polygraph Clearly this is a room that can
be as pleasant -- or as unpleasant - as the occasion requires

MARINA

is seated on the couch near the fire with the polygraph wired
to her arm Seated across from her is KOLKHAZHNA a smooth KGB
interrogator who calmly questions her in Russian Kolkhazhna’s
ASSISTANT -- who is wearing a sidearm -- watches the needle
flutter behind her Kolkhaznha’s manner is friendly avuncular
and well-trained -- clearly designed to put Marina at ease

KOLKHAZHNA
(switches to English)
Do you speak English fluently
MARINA
Yes --

KOLKHAZHNA
Did you speak in English with the other
prisoner while being transported here

MARINA
Yes -- but --

KOLKHAZHNA

(friendly)
Just answer yes or no -- this is only a
preliminary debriefing General Pushkin
will arrive soon for more thorough
questioning

(presses on)
Do you have any prior relationship with
the other prisoner

MARINA
(decisively)
No --
ON THE NEEDLE
-- it flutters widely across the scrolling paper --
KOLKHAZHNA

looks intrigued as his assistant shakes his head Meanwhile -—-

EXT WIDE ON URAL MOUNTAINS - A MILITARY ATTACK HELICOPTER
approaches quickly flying high over the range -- as --
INSIDE THE GUEST ROOM - BOND

has dragged the fireplace screen over and yanked a wire out to
pick the lock of the handcuffs but it’s a very awkward task --

INSIDE THE SALON - KOLKHAZHNA

paces around in front of the picture window -- he is behind
Marina and his assistant --

KOLKHAZHNA
(measured firm)
I ask again -- do you have any prior
relationship with the other prisoner

MARINA
No -- I yes we met once -- but --

KOLKHAZHNA
In that meeting -- did you and the
prisoner discuss your plans to murder
Alexei Makvenio

Marina is simultaneously angry and nervous -- it’s obvious
this is heading --

MARINA
No -- he tried to kill me --

KOLKHAZHNA
(amused now)
He tried to kill you -- are you certain
of that

MARINA
(falters)
-- yes - yes I am -

CLOSE ON THE NEEDLE

which flutters all over registering an eight-point-five on the
bullshit scale --

OVER THE HOUSE - THE HELICOPTER

begins a slow descent --

INSIDE THE SALON - KOLKHAZHNA

ices a bit -- and waves to the assistant to shut the machine

off The assistant does taking the wires off Marina who
notices the change in Kolkhazhna’s manner

MARINA
(incredulous)
You think I’m involved with him

KOLKHAZHNA

Miss Varoskaya --

(points to file)
-- your Zaprista shows you have a
history of security -- difficulties --
which were tolerated because of your
scientific and mathematical gifts

(picks up question sheet)
Now -- you admit meeting with the foriegn
spy prior to today You admit breaking
into a military installation to find Dr
Makvenio --

MARINA
(protests)
-- to warn Makvenio --

KOLKHAZHNA
-- in the same military installation the
other prisoner was captured at precisely
the same time you were discovered inside

As Kolkhazhna speaks -- the military helicopter HOVERS into
view in front of the window -- it can’t be heard due to the
room’s soundproofing

where

Kolkhazhna sees it and nonchalantly waves acknowledgement as it
looks like it’s landing -- then turns his back on it to continue
his theorizing --

KOLKHAZHNA
-- now Makvenio is dead -- and on your way
here you and the prisoner conducted a
conversation in English for secrecy

Kolkhazhna tosses the question sheet onto the couch -- as he
does -- the helicopter not only doesn’t land -- it pivots to
face the window head on --

-— we see but can’t hear as it fires a side mounted missile
that rockets toward the window --

KOLKHAZHNA

How would you add up this particular

equation Miss Varoskaya
Marina turns around to address this -- and sees --
MARINA’S POV OUT THE WINDOW THE MISSILE
speeding directly toward the window -- it’s inches away as --
IN THE SALON - MARINA
doesn’t even get time to scream -- the momentary silence in the
room is filled with the sound of the missile impacting against
the armored glass destroying it -- Kolkhazhna is thrown
across the room as is his assistant -- the room is a storm of
fire smoke and glass --
-- Marina is shielded a bit by the couch -- she is hurled
against a bookcase as furniture blows across the room like toys
in a doll’s house --
INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - TREVELYAN
is in the co-pilot’s seat not Pushkin -- behind him are
Savatier Morley and four other assassins each carrying
assualt rifles and dressed to kill --
IN THE GUEST ROOM - BOND
is several rooms away but can still feel the impact of the
explosion -- he goes to work on the handcuff lock with renewed
urgency -- as --
HIGH ANGLE ON HOUSE - THE HELICOPTER

fires another side-mounted missile low to the first floor of
the house -- it impacts against --

A COMMUNICATIONS CENTER

that is blown to bits killing most of the Russians inside --
INSIDE THE HELICOPTER TREVELYAN
smiles as the helicopter tracks left and upward -- he sees --
TREVELYAN’S POV THROUGH WINDOW BOND

is a perfect target handcuffed to the marble visible through
this window - his eyes lock on Trevelyan’s --

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER TREVELYAN
turns to the pilot --

TREVELYAN
You may fire when ready

INSIDE THE GUEST ROOM - BOND

desperately manipulates the wire in the cuff’s lock as behind
him the helicopter turns to face the window directly --

-- the missile’s exhaust FIRES -- it speeds toward the
window -- as it does --

-- a tiny CLICK tells us Bond has finally opened the cuff --
he rips it off his hand diving across the room as --

THE MISSILE IMPACTS AGAINST THE ARMORED GLASS
-- the glass rips through the room like grenade shrapnel -

-- Bond half-ducks is half-blasted behind a couch -- as part
of the ceiling falls in on him --

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - THE HELICOPTER

touches down as it does Savatier Morley and the other
assassins run out automatic weapons ready --

TWO ASSASSINS

move around the house mowing down Russian guards that are
positioned there -- as --

SAVATIER AND MORLEY

move into the house -- parts are on fire and emergency
lighting is on -

-- the two split up killing without question everyone in
their path - we note that Morley in addition to having a
machine gun has a flame thrower strapped to his back --

IN THE GUEST ROOM’S WRECKAGE - PART OF THE CEILING PAINTING

is shoved aside as Bond bloodied struggles from the wreckage
Bond heads for the door -- but before he reaches it --

-- Trevelyan moves into the doorway -- aiming a pistol at Bond
-- smiling easily Triumphantly

TREVELYAN
Pity destroying this place I still pay it
a visit every spring
(gestures outside)
The first strawberries of the season
always seem to show up over the graves of
005 and 003

There is the SOUND of rapid-fire shooting downstairs --
IN THE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - THE DOOR

is kicked in -- a female WORKER is frantic and at a radio
microphone frightened as --

MORLEY

aims the nozzle of the flame thrower at her -- and blasts her
with it --

BACK IN THE GUEST ROOM - BOND AND TREVELYAN

Trevelyan maintains his distance from Bond -- ready to shoot at
any time But Trevelyan is in no mood to rush things

TREVELYAN
I am genuinely sorry to have put you
through that charade years ago James But
when I defected the Russians were
skeptical The head of MI6 simply crosses
over They thought I was laying out some
sort of trap for them

Bond slowly edges back back toward the window back toward a
certain pile of rubble --

BOND
So to convince the Russians -- you set a
trap for ne

TREVELYAN

(nods)
I persuaded them to leak news of my
capture through a diplomatic frequency I
knew Whitehall had tapped I was certain
that you’d want to attempt a rescue

(smiles)
I’m much obliged After your visit the
Russians believed every recognition cipher
-- every safehouse location -- every
operative’s name I supplied them with

BOND
(quietly)
You bastard --
BOND’S HAND

edges closer to a small broken marble column atop some of the
rubble -- the perfect size for a club -- but --

-- Trevelan’s gun FIRES twice -- blasting the club away --
TREVELYAN
steps closer -- gun levelled at Bond --

TREVELYAN
(angered)
An embarrassing clumsy attempt I’d hoped
we could be more dignified than this As
you wish --
(hard)
On your knees -- face the wall

Bond has no choice -- he drops to his knees -- Trevelyan moves
behind him --

TREVELYAN
You must have had orders to kill me if I
couldn’t be rescued so the Russians
wouldn’t interrogate me I gave you one
clean shot You chose not to take it
(with finality)
Lock your hands behind your back

CLOSE ON BOND’S FACE

Bond winces as Trevelyan presses the gunbarrel against the base
of Bond’s skull --

TREVELYAN
Because you lacked the nerve to shoot me
back then James -- it’s your finger on
this trigger not mine --
BOND
(with contempt)
Go ahead -- shoot -- I only wish I could

see the look on your face two days from
now when you try to fire Tempest

Trevelyan hesitates -- as --

LOWER DOWN IN THE HOUSE - SAVATIER

systematically works through the house -- kicking in door after
door -- firing bursts of gunfire at anything that moves --

IN A HALLWAY - MORLEY

steps over the flaming body of a dead Russian GU --

IN THE SALON - MARINA

is stunned from the blast -- and terrified at the SOUND of the
shooting which is drawing nearer -- she pulls herself out of
the stone and wood that’s pinning her down --

-- and starts to dig in another pile of wreckage where
Kolkhazna’s dead assistant is covered --

IN THE GUEST ROOM - BOND AND TREVELYAN
» Trevelyan is a bit off-balance - Bond is playing for time -

BOND
Makvenio told me everything Trevelyan
Before I was picked up I called in
Tempest ’s control codes to our Moscow
Station By now the satelites have been
recalibrated-- or destroyed

Trevelyan smiles now knowing it’s a bluff --

TREVELYAN

If Makvenio had told you anything at all
you’d know that isn’t possible The girl
posed a minor threat --

(indicating gunshots)
-- that has now been eliminated I can
detonate Tempest at the time -- or
target -- of my choosing

BOND
Is that the threat you’11l make Global
blackmail

TREVELYAN
(beneath him)
So It’s been done

(disappointed)
Was your imagination always so limited I
intend to use the weapon James -- to
the fullest possible advantage

(beat)
I am sorry you won’t see that happen But
I promise to come back here next spring --
for your first crop of strawberries --

Trevelyan pulis the hammer back on the pistol -- but --
BEHIND TREVEYLAN - A RUSSIAN OFFICER

battered from one of the blasts -- shows up in the doorway and
points an automatic at Trevelyan --

Trevelyan turns at the noise and shoots -- nailing the
officer in the chest -- he falls over dead or dying but his

finger is locked on the trigger -- the machine gun’s entire
clip sprays around the room --

Trevelyan is forced to jump to one side of the room as the
bullets impact where he was --

-- Bond is driven forward -- he’ springs toward the broken window
and dives - the bullets from the dying Russian’s gun
) stitching a line under him on the floor --

-- the bullets from Trevelyan’s automatic blazing over and
under Bond in a crossfire that impacts on the window’s edge --

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - BOND DIVES OUT THE WINDOW

and lands rolling in the rubble breaking into a run -—-
bullets are everywhere as Bond tries to get out of range --

UP IN THE SECOND STORY WINDOW - TREVELYAN
is firing down at Bond - as --
IN THE SALON - MARINA

claws through the rubble -- and unearths enough of Kolkhzhna’s
assistant to get at his sidearm -- she stands up as --

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - BOND

is closely followed by Trevelyan’s shots -- to get away from
them he jumps into --

THE SALON’S BROKEN WINDOW - BOND
crashes into the rubble and stops short because he’s facing --

-- Marina -- standing on the other side of the room --
terrified and aiming the gun at Bond --

-- Bond holds up his hands calm - and tries not to appear
threatening -- he steps closer --

BOND
Marina -- we’ve got to get out of here --

Marina FIRES the gun once -- the shot goes over Bond’s
shoulder --

MARINA
(shouting frightened)
Don’t come near me
IN THE HALLWAY - MORLEY

hears the sound of the SHOT -- about thirty feet distant -- he
runs down the hall flame-thrower ready --

IN THE SALON - BOND AND MARINA

Marina’s hands shake violently on the gun -- Bond knows he has
almost no time to try to convince her - that time is cut even
shorter as --

IN THE DOORWAY - MORLEY
arrives aiming the flame-thrower’s nozzle directly at

Marina --
-- Bond sees it before Marina does -- he lunges toward her --

- she fires at Bond just missing him as he knocks her out of
the way of --

-- a gas-fed blast of flame that HISSES twenty feet across the
room -- the flame SINGES Bond’s clothes as it passes --

-- Marina is shoved in relative safety against a pile of
rubble --

BOND AND MORLEY

Bond has little time to react as Morley turns to face Bond the
flame arcing with him -- Bond grabs a poker from what’s left

of the fireplace and slams it against the nozzle of the
flamethrower diverting it for a moment -- the full-blast stream
of flame burning right next to Bond -

MARINA

-- hands trembling -- points the pistol at both men -- as --

THE STREAM OF FLAME

arcs around and over Bond -- Bond tries to control it with the
poker but the swordfight is over - Morley moves back beyond
the reach of the poker -- Bond is finished --

-- but Marina fires the gun once with shaky aim --

-- the flamethrower’s tank is hit -- but this is reinforced
steel -- the bullet has no effect --

-- Marina fires again - pointing more than aiming --
-- and this time she hits a weaker point --
THE JOINT

where the flamethrower’s nozzle is attached to the tank -- a
pressurized mist of flammable chemicals is released --

-- Morley turns to see this horrified -- Bond takes the
opportunity to rush Morley and kick him across the room -- as
Morley tumbles the tank spews a trail of flammable mist --

-- Bond grabs Marina’s hand and yanks her out through the
window -- right behind them --

-- as Morley rolls across the floor - across the room a
flaming piece of rubble ignites some of the airborne mist --
like a cheap bottle rocket the flame spirals through the air
igniting the mist along the same path Morley has taken until
the aerial fuse burns into the tank itself --

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - THE EXPLOSION
blasts some of the pre-exploded debris out the window --

-- Bond pulls Marina out of the way of the blast and shields her
body holding her against the wall - Bond’s hand is on Marina’s

wrist and he takes the gun away from her --

ON BOND AND MARINA’S FACES

which are inches apart breathless She’s terrified and
physically pinned by Bond -- if Bond wanted to kill her he
could do it easily Instead Bond releases his grip on her --
and lowers the gun

Marina is as confused as ever -- her eyes search Bond’s looking
for a reason to trust him --
MARINA
Who are you
BOND
My name is Bond -- James Bond --

(at sound of GUNSHOTS)
-- would you mind if we discussed the rest

later
Marina’s frightened look tells us she still doesn’t entirely
trust Bond -- but the approaching gunmen make up her mind for
her Bond and Marina start a run across the house’s yard toward
the lake -- but bullets kick up ice and snow around them --
FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW - SAVATIER
fires a machine gun down at them --
FROM BEHIND - TWO ASSASSINS
come from behind the house firing their machine guns too --
BOND AND MARINA

have no choice but to continue a very long run in a very exposed
position -- the thin cover of the ridge seems very far off --

-- bullets kick up around them as they run past the grounded

helicopter --

-- the helicopter PILOT takes a machine gun and fires from the
side of the copter at Bond and Marina as they reach the ridge --

BOND

stops running -- and points the pistol back at the helicopter as
bullets burst into the trees around him --

Bond fires back at the helicopter -- not at the pilot not at
the assassins who are catching up fast but at --

THE HELICOPTER’S SIDE-MOUNTED MISSILES

Bond’s bullets SPARK around the launch tubes -- until one shot
TINGS inside a launch tube igniting a warhead --

WIDE VIEW ON YARD - THE HELICOPTER EXPLODES

in a fireball of gasoline and munitions as the pilot runs ina
panic away from it -- the explosion flattens across the yard --

-- awall of flame separates the pursuing killers from Bond and
Marina --

AT THE LAKE’S EDGE - BOND

and Marina dash across the ice over to the seaplane’s dock --
-- Bond helps Marina into the passenger side door -- as --
BACK AT THE HELICOPTER - A RENEWED SERIES OF EXPLOSIONS

cause the assassins to scatter as more of the munitions carried
by the helicopter explode --

BOND MOVES AROUND TO THE PILOT’S SIDE
and opens the door smiling at the chaos behind him -- a

familiar look of triumph blooms on his face as he starts to get
in -- until he looks down --

THE PONTOONS OF THE SEAPLANE

are halfsubmerged and frozen into the ice -- this plane is
going nowhere - even if it could be moved the pontoons
certainly now weigh more than the plane can lift --

BOND’S FACE

reflects this sudden change in fortune -- he turns to the
renewed SOUND of approaching GUNSHOTS --

THE ASSASSINS

pass the helicopters wreckage and explosions -- one man runs
out on the ice firing a machine gun at Bond and Marina --

- another takes a shoulder-mounted stinger -- and aims it --
STINGER SCOPE POV THE PLANE AND THE DOCK

are in the crosshairs -- as --

AT THE SAFEHOUSE - TWO ASSASSINS

get on motorcycles from the safehouse’s garage -- and ride
them out through the fire and toward the ice --

INSIDE THE PLANE - MARINA’S POV OUT WINDSHIELD

In summary a shoulder-fired missile two motorcycles four
killers and who knows how many guns are on the way --

MARINA
justly looks terrified --
BOND

is half-in half-out of the plane -- he only has one idea and he
clearly doesn’t like it much -- he ‘turns to Marina --

BOND
Start the engine

As the plane’s ancient engine SPUTTERS to life and the prop
starts buzzing --

-- Bond takes his gun - and fires down at the ice around both
pontoons SHATTERING and CRACKING the ice -- Bond climbs into
the plane as --

THE STINGER

is fired by the assassin --

STINGER POV

it rockets low along the ice toward the dock -- as --

THE PLANE

GROANS under the strain of the iced pontoons as Bond revs the
miserable sounding engine to full --

-- the pontoons break away from the ice lake -- they still
weigh literally a ton and the plane can’t lift off -- but --

-- the plane moves ahead the pontoons SKIDDING on the ice --
it picks up speed and pulls away from

THE DOCK
justas the stinger arrives to SPLINTER it in a huge BLAST --
ON THE ICE LAKE - THE ASSASSINS

run toward the plane firing -- but Bond revs the engine and
steers the icebound plane toward the killers --

ASSASSIN POV - THE PLANE
is skidding toward them propeller first --

-- the two who were on foot instead of standing their ground
flee from the approaching propeller --

- Bond turns the plane -- and the left wing of the plane knocks
them to the ice unconscious --

-- as the plane skids further on the ice -- one of the
motorcycle assassins falls on his side to avoid the wing - the
motorcycle and the assassin slide out of control -- but --

ON THE EDGE OF THE ICE LAKE - A KILLER

on a motorcycle races along the lake’s edge keeping pace with
the plane -- he fires a machine gun at the plane as he does --

THE PLANE

is hit in the rear and is damaged --

BOND

speeds up the plane to try to get away -- he steers the plane
away from the motorcycle -- and toward --

THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

which presents the only exit -- the mouth where the lake drains
into the river rapids -- this is where ice chunks have been
breaking off and slamming down --

BOND

directs the plane toward this -- Marina SCREAMS as --

THE PLANE GOES OVER THE EDGE

and into the river rapids smashing down the pontoons driven
along by the current just like any other chunk of ice --
they’re steered only by Bond’s manipulation of the propeller and
the flaps --

BOND AND MARINA’S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - THE RIVER

is a swirling chute of whitewater and rocks -- an ice chunk

ahead of them the size of a rowboat SLAMS against a rock and
smashes into powder --

-- Bond desperately steers to try to avoid the same fate -- the
plane veers toward the side -- as --

ALONG THE RIVERBANK - THE MOTORCYCLE

appears running comfortably along a smooth slightly elevated
path that runs parallel to the river -- the assassin has a
relatively easy time firing down at --

THE PLANE

-- bullets stitch across the canvas wings -- and shatter the
rear windshield --

CLOSE ON THE ASSASSIN

as he pulls a grenade off his vest -- and removes the pin with
his thumb --

BOND’S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Bond sees this - and tries to steer away from the cyclist --

but the assassin throws the grenade toward the right side of
the plane --

THE RIGHT PONTOON OF THE PLANE IS BLOWN OFF

with a terrible SCREAM of metal as the grenade detonates under
it -- the wing moves up with the force of the blast --

- forcing the opposite wing to dip down - if it goes into
the water the plane will cartwheel --

INSIDE THE PLANE - BOND

frantically corrects again steering and manipulating the flaps
so that --

THE RIGHT WING STAYS EVEN

and compensates for the missing pontoon the plane is now
half-flying half-floating and still banging dangerously down
the river --

UP ON THE RIVERBANK - THE MOTORCYCLIST

can see what Bond has done -- he concentrates his fire --

ON THE RIGHT WING

-- pullets shred it -- if it gets much more shot up the wing
will tear off -- worse --

HIGH SHOT OF RIVER - A WATERFALL

is horizontally speaking a hundred yards distant -- and
vertically speaking is four hundred feet down --

-- at the same time we can see that the ridge the motorcyclist
is on will continue comfortably -- he’s in no danger -

-- the cyclist moves ahead of the plane pulling off another
grenade -- and thumbing off the ring --

IN THE PLANE - BOND

has to make a choice -- he deliberately steers the plane toward
arock -- Marina shrieks as --

THE LEFT PONTOON IMPACTS

against the rock -- and virtually tears off -- hanging on just
by a single bolt --

THE PLANE
is just seconds from going over the falls --
BOND

pulls back on the stick with all his might -- and revs the
engine into redlining --

THE PLANE
lifts off shakily -- drifting toward the left -- toward --
THE MOTORCYCLIST

who sees the plane approaching -- and tries to speed up -- but

-- as the plane lifts off -- the last bolt on the pontoon
finally tears off --
gl

THE PONTOON

drops like a bomb and skids along the path slamming into the
motorcyclist -

ANGLE ON WATERFALL THE PLANE

lifts off over the drop and sails above the river -- as the
motorcycle and the assassin are shoved off the edge to start the
400 foot fall --

-- the fall is cut short as the grenade detonates blasting
the cycle and the assassin into smaller pieces that finish the
drop to the icy water and rocks below

BACK AT THE WRECKAGE OF THE COUNTRY HOUSE - TREVELYAN

stands on a ridge -- as the SOUND of the explosion echoes back
he can just make out through the trees the shape of the plane
flying away -- and the sputtering and buzzing of the engine

TREVELYAN’S FACE

is an interesing blend of fury frustration and a little bit of
respect -- whatever his thoughts are he ends them to calmly
turn to his surviving men

TREVELYAN
They won’t get far in that plane When
they land -- see to it they get no
farther

The assassins rush toward a military vehicle left untouched by
the flaming wreckage of the house -- as we go back to --

THE PLANE OVER THE MOUNTAINS

The plane barely maintains altitude over the rocky mountainous
area - the wings are so shot up they’re certain to fall off
and the engine is sputtering and clearly will soon fail --
INSIDE THE PLANE BOND

looks down for a place to land The terrain below isn’t flat --
and has a number of sheer vertical cliffs Distantly visible
down one edge of the mountain is the logging camp -- and visible
beyond another edge in the valley below are railroad tracks

But there’s no chance the plane will make it that far Bond aims
down toward --

A SNOWDRIFT

that’s perched on the edge of a fifty foot deep canyon -- an
unused stable and workshed are nearby --

BOND
Brace yourself -

Bond cuts the engine -- and starts a low approach --

THE PLANE DROPS INTO THE SNOWDRIFT

- with the strain of landing the left wing tears off -- the
rest of the plane skids across the snow out of control
burrowing into the snowdrift at forty miles an hour --

-- but the spokes left over from the pontoons drag through the
snow gradually slowing the plane until it digs into the snow
drift and stops half-buried at the precipice’s edge

Bond’s door is blocked by the snow -- he heaves against it --

- as Marina unbuckles her seat belt -- and without waiting for
Bond she gets out and runs across the snowdrift -- as --

THE PLANE SHIFTS IN THE SNOW

-- partly due to its precarious position partly due to Bonds
pounding on the doorside -- it clearly will go over --

Bond sees this and pulls himself across the seat to the other
door -- and through it --

BOND ROLLS OUT OF THE PLANE

as it rolls off the canyon’s edge -- Bond lands safely in the
snowdrift as the plane cartwheels to the rocks below --

-- and the gas tank explodes starting a small fire

Bond turns to look for Marina -- she’s running away down the
snowdrift Bond crunches through the snow after her -- catching
up to her by the stables he grabs her -- and throws her -

INTO THE WORKSHED

which is full of rusted abandoned junk -- saws harnesses for
horses but nothing the previous user wanted to take Marina
lands in a wooden chair angry at the rough treatment as Bond
takes out his gun and starts to check out the workshed

BOND
I don’t expect any thanks for getting you
out of that abbotoir -- but I’d appreciate
it if you’d stop running away from me

MARINA
Youre a dangerous man to be with Mr
Bond Things have a tendency to explode
around you
(demands)
What do you want with me

AT THE LOGGING CAMP - THE MILITARY VEHICLE

pulls up through the dirt road leading in as a truck full of
LOGGERS pulls out The military vehicle tracks along the dirt
road -- until it reaches a wooden hangar -- where a couple of
WORKERS are putting away the camp’s helicopter

IN THE WORKSHED - BOND AND MARINA

Marina looks furious and indignant -- Bond is looking at the
junk trying to find something useful
BOND
You designed the control codes for
Tempest
(she nods)

Is there a destruct code as well as
activation code

Marina nods again as Bond gets some old run down wooden skiis
down from the walls Bond slams a pair down next to her --

BOND
You can ski I hope

MARINA
(right back)
Only a little better than you can fly --

BOND
Then we’re going to the nearest phone --
and you’re going to tell NATO how to shut
Tempest down

Marina pauses just a beat

MARINA
That is impossible

Off Bond’s look -- we go to --
THE LOGGING HELICOPTER - OVER THE MOUNTAINS

The helicopter is flown by Trevleyan’s pilot -- he is flanked by
one of Trevelyan’s assassins who points out the window at a
not-too-distant column of smoke from the plane wreckage

IN THE WORKSHED BOND AND MARINA

As Marina explains Bond realizes this isn’t going to be as easy
as he thought --

MARINA
The codes aren’t a collection of numbers
and letters -- they’re built into a hard
cryptography chip One is in each of the
three satelites -- and the only other one
is in the coding computer

(beat)

Without that chip -- there’s no way to
communicate with the satelites

BOND
What about tracking the satelites
themselves To shoot them down

’
MARINA
Makvenio camoflaged all of them -- one
might transmit weather data another might
seem to be a surveillance satelite And
even if they could be tracked they have
defensive lasers

Bond looks deflated

BOND
Congratulations I suppose You and
Makvenio seem to have thought of
everything Except what happens when that
thing detonates over a city

Marina is stung by this -- and responds furiously --

MARINA

As long as you’re interrogating me Mr
Bond I’11 tell you precisely what
happens when it’s fired at a city

(hard)
In a millionth of a second -- all
electrical power will cut out The surge
will start electrical fires in old
buildings petrol stations -- anywhere
that a spark can start a fire Backup
generators in hospitals won’t work - odds
are they’1l explode instead All engines
will fail -- in a dense city automobile
traffic will instantly halt -- and all air
traffic over the city will crash and
explode

(beat)
Fired at the right target it will create a
ring of fire one hundred miles wide

There is no pride no accomplishment in this description -- as
Marina forces herself through this she’s near tears She is
clearly angry and ashamed at her role in creating this device

MARINA
They had me run computer simulations on
every target Mr Bond The denser the
city the higher the kill probability In
Washington Dc the projection was four
hundred thousand In London six hundred
thousand In New York City it topped a
million

Bond realizes how much she wants to stop this thing -- and
softens his stance a bit --

BOND
(not an accusation)
Why did you build it then

MARINA

(bitter)
I suppose you became a killer for your
government of your own choice Mr Bond
Mine didn’t give me the option

(hard)
If you’ve come for me because your
government wants me to build another of
the weapons -- then you may as well kill
me now

Bond pockets his gun --

BOND
That’s not why I’m here

MARINA
Then what do you want

BOND
The same thing you do To make sure that
Tempest is never fired

Marina looks at Bond -- and finally believes him -- but the
moment is broken by the SOUND of an approaching helicopter --
Bond moves over to a window - and gets his gun out --

BOND
Get your skiis on --

Marina clamps on the skiis as Bond peers out a window -
MARINA
(anxiously)
Wouldnt we be better off staying in here

BOND’S POV OUT WINDOW THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER

can be seen on the other side of the stables -- the copter drops
a ten foot pendulum from clamps that held it underneath the
helicopter -- it starts swinging from a cable --

CLOSE ON PENDULUM — FOUR CIRCULAR BUZZ SAWS

are stacked in a long tree-trimming gadget held together with a
wire mesh --

-- the saws fire to life one by one top to bottom and are
moving toward the shack --

CLOSE ON BOND’S FACE
as he turns to Marina --
BOND
(an understatement)
No

Bond snatches up his skiis --

REAR VIEW OF WORKSHED - THE HELICOPTER MOVES TO THE STABLES

and the saws tear through them one after the other as if
they were made of straw --

-- rotting planks fly everywhere as Bond and Marina burst out
of the back of the shed the saws right behind them --

HELICOPTER POV BOND AND MARINA

ski down the slope toward a group of trees -- the helicopter
keeps pace with them swinging the saws behind them --

-- and the gunner on the right side of the helicopter fires
down at them --

ON BOND AND MARINA SKIING

-- the bullets spray up the snow between Bond and Marina --
Bond is forced by the line of fire to fork off away from
Marina into the trees --

-- Marina hooks around the trees and down the slope -- she can
see Bond is in trouble but can do nothing about it --

THE HELICOPTER HOOKS IN THE SAME PATTERN AS MARINA

and the saws swing from the wire -- easily SLASHING through
the trees topping several of them --

ON BOND SKIING THROUGH TREE AREA

-- severed tree tops tumble in his way -- he swerves around
them and is driven further from Marina --

MARINA SKIIS DOWN THE SLOPE

and hooks again -- this time going down a steep icy slope
that leads into the canyon’s floor -- it’s a long ribbon of ice
as solid slippery and unforgiving as a bobsled run --

HIGH VIEW OF CANYON - THE HELICOPTER

makes a hundred and eighty degree turn to follow Marina -- we
can see the canyon is at this point about forty feet deep and
about twenty feet wide -- it serpentines across a steep slope
with jagged rock formations everywhere -

-- the helicopter tracks with Marina -- because the canyon is
so narrow at this point it flies level with the top -- but --

THE DANGLING SAWS

nudge right behind Marina -- she’s bent over for speed but

the saws are gaining - she skiis past the wreckage of the plane
- the saws demolish it without slowing and swing across the
canyon against the rock and ice with an ear-splitting WHINE --
THE TOP OF THE CANYON - BOND

has cleared the trees -- but is well behind Marina and the
copter on the left side of the canyon --

- Bond skiis along the downhill slope of the canyon’s edge
bent over to accelerate and overtake the copter --

INSIDE THE CANYON - THE HELICOPTER IS RIGHT BEHIND MARINA
skiing a serpentine along the ice -- but now the gunner is
shooting at her -- if she gets ahead of the copter she’s a
perfect target - if she drops her pace she gets shredded -
behind her and the copter on top of the canyon we can see --
BOND

is catching up to and overtaking the helicopter -- as the
slope gets steeper Bond accelerates further and aims his
skiis directly toward the edge -- apparently on a collision
course with the helicopter -- but --

BOND JUMPS ACROSS THE CANYON JUST AHEAD OF THE HELICOPTER

-- and touches down smoothly on the slope’s opposite side --
Bond turns to maintain pace with the copter --

- the gunner fires his machine gun level at Bond -- snow kicks
up all around Bond as he gets out his pistol --

-- the grade is still steep -- but the canyon gets wider and
deeper -- so --

THE HELICOPTER

arcs down into the canyon to pace Marina -- the saws slash
just behind her chewing ice and spitting out rock -- as --

BOND KEEPS PACE WITH THE HELICOPTER

and diverts his skiis down a path along the rock wali that
runs down on an angle into the canyon -- both Bond and the
helicopter are moving down at the same angle and speed -
-- the gunner aims his machine gun at Bond -- and fires --

- bullets kick up snow all around Bond -- he takes aim without
slowing down -- he fires twice --

THE GUNNER
is hit -- he slumps and falls out the copter door -

-- and into the saws -- there’s no telling how many blades he
hits on the way down but he’s instantly reduced to a scarlet

spray --

BOND

aims at the pilot -- but the gun CLICKS empty -- Bond throws it
away and looks ahead --

BOND‘S POV - THE RIDGE

he’s skiing on is coming to an abrupt rocky end -- and Bond
is speeding toward it at forty miles per hour -- as if things
could get worse -

-- the helicopter edges over toward Bond and lowers -- the
helicopter blades crowd Bond and will soon decapitate him --

CLOSE ON BOND

- who has nowhere to go but down --

- he skiis off the path and jumps toward the helicopter --
Bond reaches out desperately diving and tries to grab the
helicopter’s skid --

CLOSE ON BOND’S HANDS

which miss the skid -- Bond is still falling --

HIGH VIEW ON BOND FALLING TOWARD THE SAWS

still reaching out -- with one hand he grabs onto the wire
mesh that’s part of the saws’ central support --

BOND CATCHES ON THE WIRE MESH OF THE SAWS

and his weight makes the saws swing wildly -- Bond’s grip is
halfway down the saws --

CLOSE ON BOND

his fingers are maybe an inch ahead of the GRINDING saws --
and slipping on the wire mesh which is slick with blood --

-- the bottom saw GRINDS against the stone canyon wall -- as
Bond swings out of control on the saw his skiis impact against
a saw blade and are shredded --

INSERT - AT TOP OF HELICOPTER - THE BOLT

holding the cable securing the saws pops halfway out --

FRONT VIEW DOWN CANYON - MARINA BOND AND HELICOPTER

Marina is still skiing just ahead of the saw blades -- Bond
steadies his grip but the saw is still swinging like a pendulum
-- and the helicopter BLASTS ahead swerving around obstacles in
the rock walls --

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - THE PILOT

looks down -- he’s almost on Marina -- he throttles the copter
ahead faster -- and smiles because he can’t lose --

HIGH VIEW - THE CANYON

is coming to an end soon -- or to be more accurate is getting
a hell of a lot deeper -- a fast approaching vertical drop makes
it about a thousand feet deeper --

CLOSE ON BOND
who has kicked off what’s left of his skiis and steadied himself

on the saws’ base -- he tries to climb up the wire mesh -- his
grip is fine but --

-- the wire panel in Bond’s grip tears loose -- Bond nearly
falls but shoots a hand up to grab another wire panel further

up Bond looks ahead --

BONDS POV - DOWN CANYON

Marina is skiing just ahead of the saws serpentining around
rocks on the icy slope -- Bond’s POV moves up to find a jagged
rock abutment sticking out of Bond’s side of the canyon --
BOND

climbs up the wire to the top and braces his legs against the
top of the saws shoving hard --

-- the saws swing and steer the saw and its cable toward the
jagged rock abutment --

CLOSE ON BOND’S FEET

which slip and catch themselves on the top of the saws’

base -- an inch off and the next thing Q’s making is a pair of
prosthetics --

THE HELICOPTER PILOT’S

attention is focused on Marina -- he doesn’t notice the abutment
until too late -- he pulls the copter up -- but as he does --

BOND LEAPS CLEAR OF THE SAWS
to fall twenty feet toward the ice --
THE WIRE

catches on a groove in the rock like an aircraft carriers
tripwire -- and it holds --

THE HELICOPTER

abruptly brakes -- and is yanked to the side -- its rotor
SLAMS against the canyon wall and shatters on one side --
as --

THE SAWS

are yanked by the impact up toward the rock abutment caught
on the wire --

THE BOLT
holding the saws to the helicopter BURSTS loose --
THE SAWS FALL TOWARD BOND

on the ice -- Bond just manages to hurl himself out of the
way -- as --

THE HELICOPTER FALLS TO THE ICE

impacting on its side and skidding down the sloping ice --
the top is on fire --

-- and the whole thing is coming down after Marina --

-- she brakes her skiis and flattens out against the canyon
wall just as the helicopter skids past -- and --

THE SAWS

also race down the ice like a runaway luge - all four of the
saws still running --

INSIDE THE MOVING HELICOPTER - THE HELICOPTER PILOT

is bloodied but alive -- he looks in one direction -- the end of
the ice and a thousand foot drop are coming up fast -- the pilot
looks in the other direction -

PILOT POV - THE SAWS
are coming up even faster --
THE SAWS OVERTAKE THE HELICOPTER

and carve through it -- you’d need THX sound to separate the
GRINDING from the SCREAMING as the tangle of wreckage
simultaneously explodes and shoots over the edge -- as --

INSIDE THE CANYON - BOND AND MARINA

A breathless Marina reaches Bond -- who is battered from the
fall -- and helps him up Marina stares down the slope as some
of the smaller bits of debris skid to a quiet halt

MARINA
(ashen)
My God -- are you all right

BOND
Yes --
(leans on wall winded)
-- but he certainly cut out of here ina
hurry

cuT TO

EXT MOUNTAINTOP SAFEHOUSE - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

Still-burning fires have left the house nothing but a charred
husk -- several military helicopters have arrived and a dozen
RUSSIAN SOLDIERS sift through wreckage In one helicopter --

PUSHKIN

riffles through the same razored-empty Tempest technical file
Bond had earlier Pushkin grimly looks to his aide as he runs up
with some charred papers

PUSHKIN
How many

AIDE

There are at least eight bodies inside

(holds up paper)
This is Varoskaya’s interrogation -- she
and Bond knew each other --

(flips through)
- it looks as if she and Bond were
working together on the assassinations

Pushkin can’t avoid the same conclusion --

PUSHKIN
Transmit to all civil authorities Bond
is to be captured If he resists -
(simply)
- he is to be killed

EXT TRAIN STATION IN URALS - NIGHT

The train sounds its WHISTLE for the final time - and pulls
away from the dingy station -- revealing on a wooden bench a
pair of elderly PENSIONERS who can’t believe their luck --
they’re wearing Bond and Marina’s outer jackets

INSIDE THE TRAIN - BOND AND MARINA

are in a private compartment -- both are now wearing the
pensioners’ tattered coats This isn’t a luxury compartment --
it’s the typical sleeper train found in Russia the only
furnishings a small table and two shelflike beds on the walls
Durable but that’s the nicest thing you could say for it

Bond is at the open door speaking in RUSSIAN to the
CONDUCTOR -- who nods and casts a friendly smile toward Marina
as he leaves

Bond locks the door and turns to Marina -- who pensively stands
in front of the window as the train slowly starts to move The
only illumination in here now comes from the small Russian town
as its lights pass by

MARINA
(meaning the conductor)
What was that about

BOND
I told him we were eloping -- and we
shouldn’t be disturbed

MARINA
(flatly)
You make an excellent liar Mr Bond

Bond abruptly pulls the shade down -- and moves her away from
the window --

BOND
And you make an excellent target Miss
Varoskaya
(faces Marina)
Weve only two days left Can you build --
or modify -- another computer to control
Tempest

MARINA
(shakes head hopelessly)
It took two years to design the first

Marina looks afraid now -- and vulnerable -- the enormity of
the trouble she’s in is collapsing in on her --

MARINA
They’re not going to stop -- are they
(looks directly at Bond)
Not until I’m dead

BOND
No They’re not

Marina is near tears - and looks out the window Bond takes her
shoulders in his hands and locks eyes with her --

BOND
So we’1ll stop them first I promise
Marina But I need your help to do it

MARINA
That is why you’re keeping me alive

Bond’s light smile is an invitation --

BOND
That’s the second reason

The ice is thawing -- Marina’s face almost breaks into a smile
that’s equally inviting --

MARINA
- and the first --

Bond and Marina stop for an instant -- unbreathing
unblinking -- sexual tension is winding them together --just
before their faces can start craning toward one another --

-- there’s a KNOCK at the door Marina rattled moves back
against the bed -- Bond tenses and crosses to the door --

BOND
Ktoh etoh

CONDUCTOR (0S)
(through door)
Kendvekte

Bond opens the door -- to reveal the smiling conductor standing
there with a small bottle of vodka and jar of caviar Precious
commodities on a train like this -- if ill-timed ones

CONDUCTOR
(proudly presenting)
Happy honeymoon

BOND
(graciously accepting)
It nearly was Spasseba

Bond closes and locks the door -- and turns to find Marina
sitting on her slim bed The mood is brightened - but her body
language indicates the fragile moment is nonetheless broken

Bond opts not to push -- sits on his bed -- and looks out the
window
BOND
Good night Marina
MARINA
(softly)
Good night James
Marina -- feeling safe for the first time in days -- shuts her
eyes -- exhausted -- and instantly finds sleep -- as --
THE TRAIN
slices through the mountainous Russian countryside -- and we --

DISSOLVE TO

EXT TRAIN STATION IN URALS - TWILIGHT

The place Bond and Marina started from -- but a pair of local
militiamen show Bond’s photo to a ticket agent -- and --

EXT ST PETERSBURG - TRAIN - DAWN

On the dark side of dawn the train GRINDS to a slower speed as
it moves through the city and nears the station --

IN THE COMPARTMENT - BOND

is sitting up awake -- his attention is focused across at

MARINA

lit up by the blue twilight fast asleep -- and still looking
beautiful in spite of the last twenty-four hours

BOND

allows himself a smile -- and looks out the window which is
opaque with frost Bond wipes at the inside and looks out --

BOND’S POV - THROUGH ICED WINDOW

Through cracks in the frost Bond can make out one militiaman —-
then two -- then three -- moving on the platform

IN THE COMPARTMENT - BOND

shakes Marina --

BOND
Marina -- wake up -- we’ve got to get off
the train -
ON THE PLATFORM - THE MILITIA
is out in full force -- at least a dozen show up rifles out --

TOWARD THE REAR OF THE TRAIN - BOND AND MARINA

jump out of a side compartment door as the slow-moving braking
train heads into the station Bond leads Marina behind the train
so the militiamen on the platform can’t see them --

-- and as the train comes to a complete stop Bond leads Marina
along the side edge of the raised concrete platform hidden from
the militiamen’s view

They move out toward the streets of St Petersburg -- but as
they round the corner of the concrete platform --

A MILITIAMAN

steps from behind it -- the double click of an automatic slide
informs Bond he’s there before the harsh voice does --

MILITIAMAN
Octahobka
The militiaman jams the barrel into Bond’s spine With no
option Bond puts his hands on his head —- as does Marina -- and

he starts to walk toward the opposite end of the station
platform But the militiaman insistently shoves Bond in
another direction away from the other militiamen --

MILITIAMAN
Ata bleezka -

BOND’S FACE

registers realization -- if he’s not being led to the militia
he’s being led toward Trevelyan --

-- as Bond and Marina pass the edge of the concrete walking
through cobblestones Bond “stumbles -- shoving Marina out of
the way -- and with a lightning stroke of his arm reaches
behind to grab the Militiaman’s gunhand and pull him forward
to disarm him --

-- Bond throws him against the front edge of the concrete
platform and is about to put out the lights -- when --

ROMALY (insistent)
Please do not hit him James --

Bond turns around to face the street --
ROMALY
is anxiously standing next to a silver Rolls Royce limousine

ROMALY
-- as it stands I already owe him a very
large favor
(impatient)
Now get into the car before you attract
the attention of a militiaman I am not
related to

Bond and Marina head for the back seat

BOND
Thanks for the lift Romaly --
(meaning car)
-- pity you couldn’t find something
inconspicuous

INSIDE THE ROLLS - AS IT PULLS INTO TRAFFIC

and drives through into the heart of St Petersburg’s busy
network of bridges and canals that lead to the Neva River --
waterways that at the moment are solid ice

ROMALY
Here this is inconspicuous Last year
they sold more of these in St
Petersburg alone than in England

BOND
How did you find us

ROMALY
(snorts)
You are joking -- such a swath of
destruction has not been cut through
Russia since the invasion of Napoleon
(MORE)
ROMALY (contd)
(beat)
I hope you are now ready to leave the
country -- while some of it yet

remains -

BOND
I am - but first --

Bond withdraws the small ivory object we saw him take from
Makvenio’s briefcase earlier

BOND
-- I need to pay a visit to a nearby bank

EXT NEVSKY PROSPEKT - DAY

The busy heart of St Petersburg’s growing financial district
crowded with foot traffic cars and streetcars It’s also the
home of St Petersburg’s best shops restaurants businesses --
and banks Capitalism has definitely arrived So have

BOND AND MARINA

who climb the wide steps up from the street toward the biggest
bank here -- from their new clothes we can see they’ve given
Her Majesty’s credit cards a thrashing at the local stores

Bond withdraws the ivory object as he and Marina enter
THE KRONSTADT BANK

which is as palatial as any of the best banks the West has to
offer Bond and Marina move through the crowded lobby to the
tellers’ windows --

MARINA
(low)
What is that thing

BOND

It’s called a chop Sort of a coding
device -- but a bit more low-tech than the
ones you used to make

(beat)
The Chinese developed them centuries
ago - and certain banks still use them
for their clients who want to hide a great
deal of money -- and their identity -- at
the same time

(smiles)
Works quite well -- right up to the point
when someone else gets his hands on it

As they reach a teller’s window Bond stamps the chop’s
intricate design end against a piece of paper leaving an
imprint -- and pushes that across the window to the TELLER

BOND
I’d like access to my safety deposit box
please

IN A REAR BANK HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

Bond and Marina walk past and into vault gates -- the
officious teller walking several steps ahead The teller stops
at a certain box and takes out her keyring --

TELLER
Your key please

Unfazed Bond twists the chop -- it unscrews into two halves --
and takes the key out Bond and the teller turn the twin
cylinders simultaneously -- and

A MOMENT LATER - IN A PRIVACY CUBICLE - THE DEPOSIT BOX

is on the table Bond pops it open -- and the only thing inside
is a small leather folder with a globe and the name GEOCOM
stamped on the front Bond opens this -- and inside it is a

single three-inch 144 megabyte computer diskette
Bond eyes it quizzically --

BOND
(thinking out loud)
People hide millions in these
accounts -- and Makvenio’s keeping a
computer diskette here instead --

Meanwhile --
UPSTAIRS IN THE BANK - IN A SEALED ROOM

that’s full of up-to-the-minute banking computers registering
wire transactions -- only one man is working -- it’s --

JORDAN

-- who we saw earlier having dinner with Trevelyan -- he’s
working at his desk typing at a computer terminal A window
tells us this room is in the bank’s top floor Jordan’s harried
appearance tells us he’s been busy for some time But his
satisfied look tells us that he’s done as he taps a final key --

ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN
the message appears

RECODING SEQUENCE COMPLETED
SYSTEM ON LINE

Jordan shuts off the computer -- and steps away from his desk
satisfied The job’s done But as he passes a sextet of
surveillance monitors Jordan’s look of contentment vanishes
like a morning haze --

ON ONE BLACK AND WHITE SURVEILLANCE SCREEN - BOND

is visible walking out through the corridor leading from the
safety deposit box vault

JORDAN

realizes what this means -- he grabs a qun from his desk
shoves it into his jacket and runs out the door toward the
side stairs of the main hallway -- as --

BY THE TELLER’S DESK - BOND AND MARINA

are shown out -- the teller opens the gate for them -- they
calmly walk out into the lobby -- as --

FURTHER BACK IN THE BANK’S MAIN LEVEL - JORDAN

hits the bottom of the stairs running breathless looking

fate -- there is the SOUND of a GUNSHOT over the --

SMASH CUT TO

lowers his smoking gun against the leather desk -- our view of
him is suddenly obscured as -

-- the lifeless form of Jordan topples to the ground his
blank face hitting the floor and filling the screen with a
bone-on-marble THUNK A black high heeled shoe gently tips the
corpse off its side and onto its back -- as we go to a --

HIGHER ANGLE - TREVELYAN AND XENIA
Xenia unconcerned steps away from the body -- and the blood

pooling on the tile Trevelyan has lost none of his certitude of
victory -- but he is definitely at minimum annoyed
XENIA
Chances are extremely slim that Bond will
figure it out

(beat)
And slimmer still that he will stop us

TREVELYAN
Don’t underestimate him Bond has an
appalling success rate with infinitesmal
chances

EXT PALACE SQUAREHERMITAGE - HIGH ANGLE SUNSET

The setting sun only enhances this spectacular sight -- on one
side is the yellow arch of General Staff Building -- across the
snow-carpeted square is the massive state museum of the
Hermitage which now has a group of classical musicians on the
steps playing Tchaikovsky

Scattered throughout the square is a huge crowd many of whom
are wearing Romanov era period costumes as part of a festival
celebrating the era with music and fireworks Royalty so long
forbidden in Russia is now back in style We’1l1 note too that
there is no shortage of people on horseback -- both festival
goers and the occasional militiaman

In the middle of it all are
BOND AND MARINA

who sit at the base of the Alexander Column -- a statue atop a
huge spire in the square’s center -- waiting as forty feet
away we can see Romaly approaching through the milling crowd
Unfortunately --

SOMEONE ELSE’S TELESCOPIC POV IS ON ROMALY

and it CLICKS in as Romaly reaches Bond and Marina -- we go
back to an ordinary POV of --

THE ALEXANDER COLUMN - BOND AND ROMALY

Romaly hands Bond several papers as the festival crowd
circulates around then

ROMALY
Follow these directions to Toksovo --
(Bond glances at them)
- and you’11 find a KRG-33 that a friend
of mine has liberated from the old
Kharofskav airfield

Bond smiles at Romaly’s resourcefulness -- Marina winces --

MARINA
My first job was in Air Defense
Directorate -- that plane is a terrible
design --

ROMALY

- but an excellent price Where else
but Russia can you buy a military plane
for two thousand dollars and a case of
American bourbon

(back to business)
I’ve checked on that name -- Geocom is a
new firm established eighteen months ago
to take satelite photographs for petroleum
and mining companies

BOND
That’s a perfect cover -- Trevelyan would
have all the equipment he needs to
activate Tempest Where is it based

ROMALY

A small island in the Carribbean called
St Latrelle

(beat)
There is something puzzling though
James You say Trevelyan will fire the
weapon tomorrow --

(Bond nods)
-- but London reports that no threat -- no
blackmail demand -- no communication of
any kind has been made on any
frequency to any government

Bond looks perplexed -- this doesn’t fit the usual pattern --

but his attention is drawn to the side --

BOND’S POV - SEVERAL MILITIAMEN

are shoving through the festival crowd toward Bond’s

position -- the POV shifts to reveal at least adozen more are
coming from other directions -- as one makes eye contact with
Bond he shouts in Russian and they start moving faster --

BOND
turns to Romaly and Marina --

BOND
(terse)

It’s me they’re after -- lose yourselves

in the crowd --

Marina and Romaly hesitate -- Bond angrily snaps at Romaly --

BOND

For God’s sake get her out of here

Romaly pulls Marina toward the Hermitage deftly zig-zagging

through the festival crowd

HIGH ON PALACE SQUARE - BOND RUNS THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION

toward the archway -- the olive-garbed militiamen cut through
the more colorfully dressed crowd toward Bond --

-- and finally Bond is grabbed by three militiamen as --

IN THE CROWD - ROMALY AND MARINA

slice through quickly -- Romaly skillfully cuts off a pursuing
militiaman by knocking a faux noble to the ground causing a
pedestrian pileup --

-- they serpentine through the crowd -- and pass the steps of
the Hermitage -- almost unnoticed --

- almost -
ON THE HERMITAGE STEPS - XENIA AND SAVATIER

see Romaly and Marina -- without a word to each other they
separate and begin to take a parallel path in the street
through the crowd -- as Xenia starts out she casually removes a

pair of hoop earrings --

IN THE GENERAL STAFF BUILDING ARCHWAY - BOND

is dragged into the domed passage by the militiamen to face --
-- a grim Pushkin

PUSHKIN
We had a surveillance team tracking your
accomplice -- Kosygyn Don’t worry 007
Soon he and the woman will join us --
(beat)
- and we will all have a lengthy
conversation about so many things

ON A SIDE STREET - NORTH OF THE HERMITAGE - ROMALY AND MARINA

are quickly moving through the crowd close to the buildings in
the direction of the Neva’s riverbanks -- night has now fallen
completely --

MOVING P LLEL ACROSS THE STREET - SAVATIER

keeps his full focus on Romaly and Marina slicing through the
crowd effortlessly with no pushing no running nothing that
would draw attention -- as he pulls a plastic shopping bag out
of a coat pocket he strides quickly to pass the position of
Marina and Romaly -- and he moves behind a column --

-- where he inobtrusively pulls out an automatic pistol --
with a silencer and a laser sight -- assuming a natural
position leaning on the column Savatier puts the gun in the
bag -- through a hole he can aim across the street --

SAVATIER’S POV - ROMALY AND MARINA
move briskly but are not running -- Romaly doesn’t want to draw
attention either -- they don’t notice the red spot of the laser
sight tracking behind them --
SAVATIER
calmly imperceptibly moves his hand -- there is nothing

suspicious about his appearance nothing to alert any of the
festival crowd --

TIGHT ON ROMALY AND MARINA —- THE LASER

moves behind their heads - illuminating the walls scattering
light on glass -- and overtakes them --

-- the laser sight rests on Marina’s temple -- and holds
steady --

SAVATIER’S FINGER
tightens on the trigger --
TIGHT ON ROMALY AND MARINA

as Romaly’s attention finally is caught by the laser sight --
knowing what it is he grabs her and shoves heraway as --

SAVATIER

squeezes the trigger twice - the only evidence is the muffled
PFFT-PFFT -- the effect is --

ROMALY IS HIT TWICE IN THE BACK

- his coat tears open from the bullets’ entry -- he falls to
the ground --

-- Marina screams -- and sees --

-- Savatier running across the street to finish the job
shoving through the crowd with no pretense of secrecy left --

-- Romaly looks up at Marina who is frozen with fear --

ROMALY
(weak)
Run --
(shouts now)
Bezhat

Marina snaps out of it and runs down the banks of the Neva --
-- as Savatier reaches Romaly -- and pauses -- aiming down his

gun -- the spot is on the bridge of Romaly’s nose -- he looks up
and spits out an unmistakably foul Russian curse --
ROMALY’S POV OF SAVATIER

standing over him remorseless -- all Romaly is to him is
unfinished work -- blank-faced he pulls the trigger as --

INSIDE THE STAFF BUILDING ARCHWAY - BOND

is being dragged at gunpoint by the militiamen -- they are now
well inside the public tunnel-like passage way as festival goer
move past them Pushkin walks alongside Bond -- he seems almost
disappointed in him --

PUSHKIN
Assassinating our scientists was
needless 007 -- the weapon has been

destroyed --
BOND
(angry)

Has it Did you find even a scrap of
the control computer when you combed
through the Severnaya wreckage

Pushkin’s badly conjured poker face answers no --

BOND

(urgent)
General -- I know you can’t deactivate
the weapon The only person alive who
can is that woman and if I don’t get
her to the control computer in the next
twenty-four hours the Tempest is going to
be fired

(beat)
Possibly against a Russian target

As Pushkin chews on that Bond drives it home desperate to
convince him --

BOND
-- and if your Tempest is used against a
Western city tomorrow -- how much longer
do you think peace will last

Pushkin shows little sign of concession - but he is thinking
about it -- even as his aide butts in --

AIDE
(contemptuous)
He is obviously lying General --

As the aide cites Bond’s sins Bond’s attention is drawn ahead
in the curving archway --

BONDS POV - A “ROYAL COACH

is slowly trotting in their direction -- with two attendant
costumed guardsmen on their own horses --

ON BOND

who considers this -- he has two militiamen at his back -- and
others surrounding him -- in order to let the coach pass
through the others move to the side -- as the coach and the
guardsmen’s horses are closest --

- Bond savagely sweeps an elbow back into a militiaman’s jaw

putting him out -- the second militiaman instantly aims his
pistol at Bond but Bond grabs his qunhand -- a SHOT is FIRED
up into the ceiling -- the instant it’s fired --

-- all of the horses terrified at the noise rear up
the guardsmen are thrown off their horses tumbling into
colorfully garbed heaps on the concrete -- the militiamen
endangered in the enclosed space back up in disarray --

-- Bond charges past the rearing coach horses -- and leaps onto
a riderless guard horse -- Bond reins the horse down and away
kicking the horse so that it tears away at full gallop down
through the arch tunnel --

-- the militiamen who aren’t ducking coach horse kicks are
blocked from shooting at Bond by the coach itself -- due to the
arch tunnel’s curvature Bond is nearly out of range -- but -
PUSHKIN’S AIDE

manages to get clear -- he draws a gun and aims it at Bond -- he
has a perfect shot --

- which is spoiled when Pushkin knocks his arm up toward the
ceiling -- Bond manages to get out of range rounding the
tunnel’s curve -- the aide astonished angered turns to
PUSHKIN

whose troubled face shows he isn’t sure he can believe Bond --
but he can’t afford to take the chance that it wasn’t true

Behind Pushkin militiamen are shouting into radios -- as --
HIGH SHOT OF PALACE SQUARE - BOND ON HORSEBACK

streaks through the square parting the crowd ahead of him -- as
the first set of fireworks booms out of the Hermitage and
blooms over the Neva River --

NEAR THE NEVA’S BANKS - THE SUMMER GARDEN

is a sprawling gorgeous park now blanketed with snow - aside
from dozens of classical statues no one is here -- except --

A TERRIFIED MARINA
- lit for the moment by the fading firework blast above --

she runs in from the street through a central trail and down a
side trail --

SAVATIER

is running not far behind -- it seems one stride of his equals
two of hers -- he follows her trail in the snow --

NEAR THE HERMITAGE —- BOND ON HORSEBACK

Bond halts his full gallop when he sees a crowd gathered
around someone - we can see the crowd obscuring the view -- we
can see the snow -- we can see the blood -- and we can see -

BOND’S EXPRESSION

when he sees what’s left of Romaly -- anguished furious he
spurs the horse on toward the Summer Garden -- as --

TIGHT ON MARINA

as she desperately stumbles through the Summer Garden trying to
weave through the thick trees and statues in the darkness --

ON SAVATIER

who is behind her -- calm and confident -- by using statues as
visual markers we can see he’s very near Marina following the
trail in the snow -- until he stops -- and looks down --

-- the snow -- and the trail -- ends in a stone clearing that
leads to another trail

Savatier considers for a moment -- and decides to move down that
clearing and the trail it leads to -- watching him vanish is

MARINA - HIDING BEHIND A STATUE

and doing her best to keep her heavy breathing silent -- as she
hears the SOUNDS of Savatier’s steps moving away she turns to
leave backtracking -- as she passes a statue another firework
display brightens the sky --

-- illuminating behind Marina Xenia -- she hooks the hoop
earrings together and draws out a wi ire -- now a perfect
garrotte that is wrapped around Marina’s neck as the firework
and the light dies out --

AT THE SUMMER GARDEN ENTRANCE - BOND

shows up on horseback -- he has no idea where to go in this maze
we can see as he enters that he’s spurring the horse in the

wrong direction -- as --
XENIA THROTTLES MARINA

-- Marina struggles and clutches at the wire but Xenia is far
stronger and isn’t even working up a sweat -- in Marina’s
thrashing she kicks at a statue -- the CRACK is heard by

BOND
who turns the horse around -- and gallo at fu speed
dodging through the statues and trees -- jumping over a bench --

leaping over a stone wall - until he sees --

BOND’S POV XENIA STRANGLING MARINA

beyond another stone wall -- the horse leaps the wall - and --
BOND LEAPS OFF THE HORSE

-- diving straight for Xenia -- Bond knocks Xenia off
Marina -- Xenia gets back up instantly --

- as Marina slumps to the ground limp and unconscious --

-- nearby Xenia pulls out a gun -- Bond lashes out knocking
the gun out of her hand and away --

-- but it’s the last good shot he gets -- Xenia pivots to
powerfully kick Bond in the head -- and applies a leverage
hold to slam Bond against the stone wall with a powerful
THUD -- and with another kick to Bond’s sternum she knocks
him totally breathless -- stunned at the relentless assault

Bond can’t move --

-- Xenia moves closer to Bond -- flushed breathing a little
faster from the exertion --

XENIA
(mocking her earlier tone)
Please James - won’t you kill me one
more way

Xenia rips open Bond’s jacket -- and with both hands pins
Bond against the stone wall -- applying the pressure point over

Bonds heart to induce a heart attack --

-- Bond is in agony -- and is too weakened to fight back -
XENIA

is getting a physical thrill from this -- killing men is
better than sex -- she presses harder against Bond’s chest -

- but her eyes close in pain with the SOUND of one

gunshot -- her grip relaxes and she has just enough time to
look surprised when the impact of the second gunshot knocks
her away from Bond -- she falls to the snow dead --

-- Bond turns to see

MARINA

weak but alive holding Xenia’s smoking gun in trembling
hands -

-- Bond moves over to her regaining his breath glad to be

alive -- more than that -- thrilled that Marina is alive --
Bond helps her up -- unaware that nearby --

SAVATIER

has heard the gunshots and is running back through the Summer
Gardens toward the source -- and elsewhere --

OUTSIDE THE SUMMER GARDENS IN THE STREET - MILITIAMEN

are racing toward the park - there are several cars -- and at
least a half a dozen men on horseback -

IN THE SUMMER GARDEN - SAVATIER

has his gun out and runs toward the source of the shots down a
main path -- but from the side the sound of galloping comes
just an instant too late to warn him -- he whirls around as --
BOND AND MARINA ON THE HORSE

leap over a stone wall on a side path - the horse’s front leg
kicks Savatier and knocks him to the ground --

-- Bond turns the horse to run down the main path and away --
Bond looks like he’s back in form -- but Marina clinging to his
back looks extremely weak -

-- Savatier takes just a second to recover -- he aims the
automatic pistol down after Bond and empties the clip -- a
dozen rapid SILENCED SHOTS chase

BOND AND MARINA RACING DOWN THE PATH

as the bullets splinter tree branches an shatter parts of
statues around them -- finally --

-- Bond steers the horse at full speed out onto a side street --
but there’s no relief here --

BOND’S POV - SIX MILITIAMEN ON HORSEBACK

are on a direct collision course down this street --
BOND

about-faces the horse and races up the street --
FRONT VIEW ON BOND AND MARINA

as Bond’s horse runs up the street - the militiamen behind them
start firing at them -- but they’re near —-

THE STEPS TO A MASSIVE CATHEDRAL
-- Bond steers the horse up the steps to the cathedral -- which
has a huge elaborate grouping of stone neoclassic columns --
fifty feet high irregularly placed close together that go on

for at least two hundred yards -- Bond kicks the horse for more
speed -- and tears into the columns --

BOND’S POV - SWERVING THROUGH THE COLUMNS

dodging left then right at top speed -- the darkness keeps
them hidden until it’s almost too late to cut away -- behind --

THE MILITIAMEN
arent faring so well -- several are thrown by their horses

who refuse to run this weird course -- several more manage to go
after Bond but can’t maintain his pace --

SIDE VIEW OF BOND THROUGH COLUMNS

Bond swerves left and right racing through -- the militiamen
who have stayed the course are getting the hang of it -- and are
catching up --

BOND’S POV - THE END OF THE COLUMNS

comes up fast -- but Bond will not give this horse a break
pushing it full speed down the opposite steps --

-- and reaching a side street with a frozen canal - Bond
races the horse down the street alongside the canal and toward
the Neva -- the horsemen still behind him -- however --

FRONT VIEW OF BOND

as he pushes the horse harder still -- what he sees ahead
doesn’t please him --

BONDS POV - A PAIR OF MILITIA CARS
-- are pulling off a side street in front of Bond --

effectively boxing him in --

HIGH ANGLE - BOND PINNED BETWEEN HORSES BEHIND CARS AHEAD

As the militia cars approach -- and the horses behind speed
up -- Bond d doesn’tlet up -- he races toward the approaching

cars until a collision seems imminent -- at the last possible
second -

- Bond abruptly veers the horse toward the canal’s wall -
Gown set of cut co ete s Ss -- and onto the frozen canal

itself --
ON THE STREET - THE MILITIA CARS COLLIDE
as they brake and skid to try to avoid running over the horses

-- the militia on horseback have similar trouble rearing up
their horses to avoid impact -- meanwhile --

BOND SPURS ON THE HORSE DOWN THE ICED CANAL

-- there’s no sign of him slowing down -- Bond and Marina crouch
down to go through a low bridge on the bank of the Neva -

CLOSE ON THE ICE

which seems just solid enough -- with each SLAM from a hoof
there is the sound of a CRACK in the ice --

THE MILITIAMEN

are agog and can do nothing but stare -- Bond is already out of
shooting range -- and none of these guys want Bond badly enough
to test the ice any further than Bond is --

MILITIAMEN POV - LONG SHOT OF BOND ON THE NEVA

As another firework display lights up the sky with a BOOM --
Bond and Marina ride out from under the bridge - and gallop
across the distant darkness of the Neva -- until --

AT THE OPPOSITE BANK OF THE NEVA - BOND AND MARINA

reach the shore -- the horse slows down to a trot -- but Marina
weakened is groggy and slipping off Bond quickly smoothly
dismounts -- and picks her up taking her off the horse and
leaning her against a tree on the riverbank

Bond takes her face in his hands -- and looks at her checking
her neck -- it’s bruised from the garrotte --

BOND
Marina -- are you hurt
Marina revives -- lightly shakes her head no -- and puts her
hands over the tear in Bond’s shirt -- their breathing is still

quickened but no longer because of the danger --
MARINA
(weakly)
I thought - you were --
Bond stops her -- tilting up her face he goes in for a light
taste of a kiss -- then a stronger one -- and as she throws
her arms around him they go into a kiss that will last for the
rest of the night

To that end a giant screen on one wall has a computergenerated

pinpointed at different positions on it and moving above the
earth Right now the place is crowded with technicians and

EXT BOND’S PLANE - ABOVE CARRIBBEAN ISLANDS - DAY

It’s morning -- the plane a long distance observer model looks
weathered but is hanging together as it flies low above a string
of islands that form a dotted line across the water --

INSIDE THE COCKPIT - MARINA

is seated next to Bond -- she’s intently working on a laptop
computer as Bond looks down at

THE ISLANDS
as they pass by underneath -- they are working definititons of

the term flyspeck islands -- small low-to-no technology not
even much in the way of population -- we cut back to --

MARINA’S COMPUTER SCREEN

which is a sea of scrolling numbers -- right now the display
shows a series of mathematical computations that move down the
screen in a speedy blur What’s happening is that sixteen digit
numeral groupings on the Jeft side of the screen are bein
converted into many more numeral groupings on the right side
This may not make sense to you but it’s ringing some bells for

MARINA

whose face shows she recognizes the type of program if not the
utilization

MARINA
Makvenio’s created some kind of intercept
cipher We used to use them on American
frequencies to --

BOND
-- intercept a coded transmission and
redirect it to the frequency of your
choice
(smiles)
We still use them in all sorts of
places

Marina keeps punching keys trying to make some sense of it -

MARINA
But this one is unusual Instead of
redirecting a single coded message to a
single receptor -- it redirects its
coded message in eight directions Or
four Or fourteen Or thirty There’s
no consistency to it

Bond motions ahead --

BOND
There it is --

POV OUT COCKPIT WINDOW - THE ISLAND

BOND (0S)
-- St Latrelle

This is the largest of the islands -- it’s covered with thick
vegetation and ringed by a jungle of massive seventy foot
trees Further in toward the center we can see the island seems
to be honeycombed with caves -- the mouths of caverns can be
seen in the sides of mountains and on the island floor itself

The most remarkable thing about the island however is the
Geocom complex ringed by guards and barbed wire fences
Probably a bit too much security for an installation like this
Its centerpiece is a gigantic radio dish antenna that’s sunken
into the island

A pair of bridges that house broadcast equipment criss-cross the

D dish -- perhaps six hundred feet across - and from the
intersection of the bridges to the bottom of the curved dish is
a drop of at least five hundred feet

INSIDE THE PLANE - BOND AND MARINA

stare down at the complex -- Marina seems a bit more impressed
than Bond --

MARINA
With an antenna that size he can
broadcast a signal to the Tempest
satelites on a long waveform frequency --

BOND
- instead of a short directed burst NATO
wont be looking for that So both the
satelites and the signal stations are
camoflaged It’s brilliant --

Bonds grim admiration is cut short by a sudden burst of
Machine gun fire tearing through the bottom of the right side of
the cockpit -- as Marina SCREAMS and moves back Bond veers the
plane left and away -- in time to see --

A SLEEK MILITARY FIGHTER HELICOPTER

WHIRRING up into view -- the copter with no rear rotor is
designed specifically for manueverability -- a feature it

shows off by zooming straight up out of the mountains to pull
level with Bond’s plane then pull a ninety-degree turn on a
dime to face Bond’s cockpit --

ON BOND

The helicopter is directly ahead -- Bond hits an overhead toggle
switch and punches a button on the control panel labelled FRONT
MACHINE GUNS -- he’s rewarded with nothing but a shower of
sparks from the panel --

-- and a hail of bullets from the helicopter --

-- Bond sharply steers away diving toward a group of
mountains -- the helicopter right behind --

BOND
(exasperated)
-- Who built this bloody plane --

MARINA
Air Defense Collective Nine -- in Minsk --
(as more SPARKS fire)
-- we lost more pilots in training
exercises than in entire Afghan war -—-

BONDS PLANE DIVES LOW OVER A SET OF MOUNTAINS

and his problems multiply --

THREE MORE ATTACK HELICOPTERS

shoot up vertically from the mountains -- behind to the left
and to the right -- and join the pursuit flying in formation
all around Bond’s plane --

- as one copter FIRES a side-mounted air-to-air missile --
Bond dodges -- the missile just misses his wing and BLASTS
against the ground --

INSIDE ONE OF THE COPTERS - THE GUNNER

focuses his targeting system on Bond’s plane -- finger about
to hit the red button --

BOND TAKES THE PLANE INTO A STEEP DIVE TOWARD THE DISH

-- as two copters follow Bond and two fall back Bond flies --

INTO THE DISH AND UNDER THE BRIDGES - BOND’S PLANE

follows the curvature of the dish as closely as possible -- it’s
a temporary refuge as they can’t fire at him here - and he
flies a tight spiral halfway down the dish - as --

ON THE DISH’S INTERSECTING BRIDGES - ARMED GUARDS

who are unlucky enough to be on the bridge fire machine guns at
Bonds plane -- but the plane is moving too fast --

WIDE VIEW ON DISH - AS THE PLANE AND COPTERS CIRCLE

-- one copter pulls out -- the playground is too crowded -- but
the other one hangs directly behind Bond‘s plane as it circles
around the inside of the dish --

BOND

struggles with the plane’s lousy controls -- and sees ahead --
BONDS POV - ON THE DISH’S INTERSECTING BRIDGES - A GUARD

has moved to a better position and is ready to shoot --

BOND

desperately pulls back on the rattling stick -- and

THE PLANE BLASTS OVER THE BRIDGE

and out of the dish as the guard FIRES at it -- unfortunately
as the copter is right behind Bond’s plane --

-- some of the guard’s machine gun fire CHEWS the copter’s
tail -- and -

THE COPTER GOES OUT OF CONTROL

as it tries to rise out of the dish -- it collides with the lip
ef the dish and EXPLODES cartwheeling up and over the edge --

BOND’S PLANE

gets no break whatsoever -- the other three helicopters
eagerly move in again left right and rear as Bond clears
the dish --

INSIDE THE PLANE - BOND AND MARINA

are surrounded by bullets that tear up the fuselage in a
three-way crossfire --

INSIDE ONE OF THE HELICOPTERS - A GUNNER
fires down an air-to-air missile toward Bond’s plane -
BOND’S PLANE DODGES

as the missile streaks past his wing to impact with the
ground --

-- the three helicopters now have Bond effectively trapped -- he
cant go up left or right -- and they’re driving him toward a
grouping of mountains --

CLOSE ON BOND

as he looks ahead for any avenue of escape --
BOND’S POV - THE MOUTH OF A HUGE CAVERN
is built into the slab of mountain rock that he’s being driven

toward -- it looks just big enough for a plane if you’re a
psycho -- or as desperate as
BOND

who focuses entirely on the hole even as bullets continue to
tear up the fuselage -- he steers away from his escort
helicopters -- and as Marina SHRIEKS --

OUTER VIEW - THE PLANE FLIES INTO THE MOUTH OF THE CAVERN

with a few feet clearance on each wingtip -- the left and
right attack helicopters shear off straight up the wall --

himt the rear attack copter remains on Bond’s six following

BOND

struggles with the miserable controls as Marina struggles with
her breathing --

BOND’S POV - THE CAVERN
angles upward at a forty-five degree angle -- and it’s not
getting wider -- it is however shifting the angle of its
width -- Bond has to delicately tilt the the plane left then
right to keep the wings from impacting against the cavern sides
-- and for all of this --
THE PLANE’S FUSELAGE

is still being ripped up by rapid twin machine gun fire from
behind --

BEHIND BOND’S PLANE - THE HELICOPTER

is pulling quite a stunt itself but as it’s smaller is having
an easier time than Bond -- the gunner keeps firing at Bond’s
tail -- in retrospect maybe this is not the best idea Bond’s
ever had -- but --

IN BOND’S COCKPIT - BOND

sees light at the end of the cavernous tunnel -- and he

reaches to the upper control panel to pul a handle -- it
doesn’t work -- Bond savagely YANKS it down again --

OVER THE WINGS OF BOND’S PLANE A MIST

flows over the top as a row of narrow vents open on the front
of each wing --

IN THE TRAILING HELICOPTER - COCKPIT POV

A cloud in Bond‘s trail filling the cavern is heading fast
for the helicopter -- the pilot panicked knows what this is --

PILOT
-- no -- stop shooting --

But the gunner keeps FIRING as they head into the cloud --
CLOSE ON HELICOPTER’S FRONT MACHINE GUN - THE FIRE

ignites the cloud -- and --

THE HELICOPTER IS ENGULFED IN AN EXPLOSION

as the gas cloud ignites itself and everything flammable inside
the helicopter --

VIEW OUTSIDE MOUNTAIN - BOND’S PLANE BURSTS FROM THE CAVERN

as the EXPLOSION and gaseous trail of fire follows him
out -- almost reaching his wings as he outdistances it --

IN THE COCKPIT - BOND

reaches up and pushes the handle back in -- as his hand moves
away we see it’s labelled FUEL DUMP --

OUTER VIEW - BOND’S PLANE

pulls up sharply - but is attacked by the two remaining
helicopters raining machine gun fire on the wings --

BOND

struggles with the stick -- but there’s no lift -- he looks
out --

POV shifts out the front windshield --

- helicopter is at twelve o’clock handmov in --
IN THE COCKPIT - BOND

gets out of the seat quickly -- and opens the storage
compartment behind the seats -- inside is --

-- one parachute --

-- Bond looks at Marina -- takes the parachute -- and straps it
on himself -- as he pulls on the last buckle --

MARINA
(desperate)
What are you doing

Through the front cockpit window we can see the helicopter
has fired an air-to-air missile - dead on target --

-- as Bond grabs Marina -- and runs the last parachute strap
through her belt lashing them together --

BOND
Hoping the workmanship was better at
People’s Parachute Factory Six --

- Bond pulls the release latch over the door --
OVERVIEW OF PLANE - BOND AND MARINA

hurl themselves out the door tumbling together into space as
the missile hits the plane and EXPLODES --

- blasting the entire plane into debris that shoots around --
BOND AND MARINA - FALLING

Bond moves over Marina to shield her from the smaller flaming
debris that’s everywhere -- they’re also not too far from the

partially-intact wingless fuselage of the plane that’s going
down ahead of them like a flaming missile -- Bond looks up -
129
BOND’S POV - THE HELICOPTERS
are menacingly not giving chase -- they’re keeping their
distance -- because when Bond pulls the ripcord he’s dead
meat -- Bond’s POV shifts down --

-- to the ground far below -- jungle foliage mountains -- and
some distance away the mouth of a deep vertical cavern --

ON BOND’S FACE

as he decides -- it’s their only chance --

OVERVIEW OF BOND AND MARINA

falling behind the streaking smoking fuselage -- Bond
stabilizes the fall flattening out -- he is aiming their
bodies toward the mouth of the cavern - as -

IN ONE HELICOPTER - THE PILOT

sees this and realizes what Bond’s up to --

CLOSE ON MARINA

as she looks down terrified this isn’t the best way to do
your first jump -- she looks up over Bond’s shoulder -- and
is not cheered --

MARINA‘’S POV —- THE HELICOPTER

is coming down fast on their six -- and firing twin machine
gunsat them --

OVERVIEW - BOND AND MARINA HELICOPTER AND FUSELAGE

are in a race to the ground -- the fuselage is a second away
from impact --

-- Bond and Marina are not far behind in the trail of smoke
from the fuselage - and about twenty yards behind them - the
helicopter is matching their angle of descent perfectly --
BOND’S POV - THE GROUND

is coming up fast -- there are only seconds to go -- but there
are still bullets blazing all around them --

BOND ROLLS OVER

so he is underneath Marina -- and draws out his qun FIRING up
into the helicopter’s cockpit - as underneath him --

THE E FUSELAGE

impacts against the ground with a blast of smoke and metal --

HELICOPTER COCKPIT POV - THROUGH THE SMOKE - BOND
is FIRING up as the copter is FIRING down -- one of Bond’s SHOTS
goes through the windshield shattering it into a spiderweb of
cracks -- another apparently hits the control panel because
it’s SPARKING like crazy --
OVERVIEW —- THROUGH THE SMOKE - THE HELICOPTER
takes a nose dive toward the flaming fuselage wreckage -- as
BOND AND MARINA BARELY CLEAR THE LIP OF THE HOLE
and fall into the unknown -- as
THE HELICOPTER IMPACTS AGAINST THE FUSELAGE

and the resulting tangle of flaming wreckage rolis and skids
toward the edge of the hole -- as

INSIDE THE HOLE - BOND AND MARINA

tumble -- they can’t see the bottom -- they can’t see the

top -- Bond pulls the ripcord -- and the chute’s canopy

opens -- and holds --

Bond and Marina spiral rapidly corkscrewing down the hole
definitely not out of danger -- the chute could snag on the
rocks or they could be crushed against the walls --

ON THE EDGE - THE FUSELAGECOPTER WRECKAGE

smashes to the lip -- and very precariously dangles there --
as rocks supporting it start to crumble underneath -- as --

BOND AND MARINA SPIRAL DOWN

- and small falling rocks prompt Bond to look up --

BOND’S POV - AROUND CHUTE’S CANOPY

Bond’s view is blocked by the chute’s canopy -- as they spiral
around once Bond can see high above the flaming wreckage
perched on the edge --

- as the next turn blocks his view there is the RUMBLING
SOUND of rocks collapsing -- when the canopy clears --

-- Bond sees tons of flaming wreckage falling into the hole --
BOND

desperately looks down --

BOND‘S POV - THROUGH THE DARKNESS - A SIDE CAVERN ENTRANCE

is twenty feet below -- and on the opposite side of the hole --

BOND ROUGHLY STEERS THE PARACHUTE

toward the cavern’s mouth -- and just under the falling
wreckage -- shooting into

THE SIDE CAVERN

just as two tons of flaming steel plummet past the hole like
a meteorite --

-- their speed unchecked Bond twists his body to keep Marina
from impacting against a cavern wall -- instead Bond painfully
SLAMS his side against a cavern wall -- he and Marina land in
a heap as the sound of the wreckage’s impact BOOMS several
hundred feet below -- and --

OVER THE HOLE - THE REMAINING HELICOPTER

lowers to the hole and hovers over it as smoke trails out -
INSIDE THE SIDE CAVERN - BOND AND MARINA

Bond has had the breath knocked out of him -- he winces in pain
as a worried Marina undoes the parachute’s latches --

AT THE EDGE OF THE HOLE - THE HELICOPTER

has landed -- and the pilot has secured a length of climbing
line to the edge -- the gunner harnessed to a motorized
ascentdescent device lowers himself into the hole with a

motorized WHIRR
INSIDE THE SIDE CAVERN - BOND AND MARINA

Bond weakly gets up with Marina’s help and leans on the cavern
wall --

MARINA
Are you hurt

Bond doesn’t answer -- he hears the mechanized WHIRR approach -

BOND
-- step back -- now --

INSIDE THE HOLE - THE GUNNER

descends swaying through the smoke -- his gun out looking down
for any sign of life that can be snuffed out --

-- as he nears the cavern -- some smoke clears and the gunner
sees Bond -- with one hand he brakes the AD mechanism with
the other he aims the machine gun --

OVERHEAD VIEW - BOND DIVES FOR THE LINE

SLAMMING into the gunner and grabbing the front harness -- the
gunner’s SHOTS go wild as the force of Bond’s leap swings them
back against the wall of the hole -- from the flames below we
can see they’re at least three hundred feet up -- -- as they

hit the wall Bond SLAMS the gunner’s hand against the stone

forcing him to drop the gun -- as they start a return swing
ack --

-- the gunner punches Bond loosening Bond’s grip on the harness
-- and the gunner withdraws a combat knife --

-- but Bond grabs the gunner’s wrist -- and forces the knife

down to sever the cloth harness - as the swing ends against
the wall with another SLAM

-- the gunner is stunned by the impact and falls out with a
SCREAM -- leaving Bond clinging to the AD mechanism --

ATTH ‘OPEDGE OF HOLE - THE PILOT

hears the nearing WHIRRING sound of the AD -- he’s crouched
over the edge peering into the smoke as --

-- the smoke and hot air lift out the empt arachute
-- the cloth flies in the pilot’s face -- annoyed he
tears it off and flips it away -- as --

BOND (0S)
Good morning --

Bonds arm lashes up -- grabs the startled pilot by the
shirt -- and pulls him into the hole with a YELL as --

-- Bond and Marina rise out of the hole on the AD Bond helps
Marina out of the hole -- and balls up the parachute throwing
it back into the hole
BOND
He should have kept that
(eyes helicopter)
Let’s have a closer look at that dish

As they step into the helicopter -- we cut to --

EXT OVERHEAD VIEW - ON DISH AND BOND’S HELICOPTER

The copter is flying low over the ground and foliage removed
from the dish’s perimeter --

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - BOND AND MARINA’S UPWARD POV

is of the huge triangularcircular metal configuration suspended
six hundred feet above the dish’s center by a trio of towers

MARINA (0S)
That’s the transmitter

ON BOND AND MARINA IN COPTER
Bond checks the electronic control panel --
BOND
There are no missiles left --
(considers)

-- if I tried to fly into it those guards

would cut us to pieces
Marina looks over to the ground -- and points --

MARINA
Take us down over there

ON THE COPTER TRACKING LOW TOWARD ONE OF THE TOWERS

Well notice there’s a key wire -- not a support wire -- leading
from the transmitter to the base of this tower

EXT BASE OF TOWER ON HILLSIDE - THE HELICOPTER

has landed behind it -- as its rotors slow and stop Bond and
Marina are at the door of the tower The tower itself looks like
a lighthouse -- tall cylindrical and narrowing as it rises
Bond pries the door open with a bar -- and --

INSIDE THE BOTTOM ROOM OF THE TOWER

is a bank of electronic equipment This is where the wire from
the transmitter leads to Marina eyes the equipment -- which is
booted up and operating

MARINA
If he’s using a long waveform to
broadcast this must be the signal
amplifier --
(beat)
-- this is the juncture between the
control computer and the dish

BOND
So if we destroy it --

MARINA
(shakes her head)
He’s certain to have backups He could
still send the signal out

Bond moves into the room -- part of the amplification equipment

is a systems maintenance computer terminal

BOND
This is hooked into the control
computer -- can you access it and activate
the destruct code

MARINA
(unsure)
Makvenio designed the defenses against
computer break-ins -
(eyes equipment)
-- and this junk is just used for systems
maintenance I don’t know James --

BOND
Youve got to try Marina It’s the best
shot we have

Bond gives her a light kiss -- and moves out the door --

BOND
I11 come back for you later --

MARINA
Where are you going

BOND
To shut this down at the source

Bond returns to the helicopter -- as we --

CUT TO

INT THE MAIN COMPUTER ROOM - HIGH ANGLE

This is the heart of Trevelyan’s control complex -- it looks
like the New York Stock Exchange as designed by Ken Adam The
room is filled with activity with COMPUTER TECHNICIANS at work
on a set of keyboards that control dozens of monitors installed
in banks four high along the walls -- each with a sea of numbers
and figures in dollars yen pounds and deuchmarks

TREVELYAN

enters - looking satisfied A man who wants to savor everything
about the day Savatier is behind him carrying a metal
briefcase - and the two cross over to a central computer that’s
not dissimilar to the one we saw in Severnaya Above it is a

visual targeting screen with a graphic of the world -- and
pinpoints that show where the Tempest satelites are in relation
to the rest of the world

Stopping there Savatier opens the metal briefcase -- and
removes the Tempest control computer from foam padding
turning it over to a head TECHNICIAN

In seconds the technician has installed it in its docking
station

TREVELYAN

Enter the target for today --
(smiling)
-- New York City

cuT TO

EXT SIDE VIEW OF ISLAND - THE HELICOPTER

circles around it -- further back from the dish is a cliff wall
over the ocean with numerous large caverns cut into it --

-- and on top of the volcanic rock behind one of the towers is
a flat clearing -- on a hillside near one of the support towers
is a small building that obviously serves as the entrance to the
underground compound and a maintenance catwalk that leads out
to the dish’s transmitter

IN THE HELICOPTER - BOND

pulls the copter up and toward the clearing -- he’s now wearing
the specs and helmet of the pilot

This is a landingmaintenance area for the helicopters --there
are four landing circles Bond hovers over the one nearest the
maintenance shed -- which we’1l note has a large tank of
aviation fuel near it with metal piping that runs into the
ground Bond lowers the copter as the sole GROUND CREWMAN runs
up to the door

GROUND CREWMAN
What the hell happened up there

Bond answers with a direct kick to the head -- the crewman
topples and Bond gets out dragging him to the shed

A MOMENT LATER - BOND

emerges from the shed -- wearing the crewman’s hat and jacket
Bond crosses the rock to

A CAGE FREIGHT ELEVATOR

that’s built into the edge of another vertical cavern -- a huge
natural elevator shaft Bond steps in -- and moves it do --

BOND’S POV - THE FIRST LEVEL

As the elevator grinds past fifty feet of rock Bond sees
through the cage wire a cave that’s been converted into a
military style storeroom -- crates piled four and five high
neatly arranged and stacked separated by wire divisions

BOND

gets out -- no one else seems to be here -- and has a look
around The storage level looks like Charles Foster Kane’s attic
-- it goes on and on -- and Bond looks with some alarm at one of
the crate groupings behind a wire cage --

-- it’s piled with crates full of metal cannisters and warnings
in Cyrillic and English script -- DANGER - NEUROTOXIC AGENTS

Bond moves ahead through the huge storage space looking left
and right and finding more of the same

i

Crates housing high-tech machine guns -- shoulder-fired missile
launchers fuel-air weapons -- land mines -- blocks of Semtex
plastic explosive -- and other weapons of mass destruction

Bond pauses at a crate of Semtex -- at the sound of some
approaching GUARDS he grabs a block -- and crouching low
behind other crates moves quickly to a ladder and hatchway that
take him down to

THE SECOND LEVEL

which is another huge cave that has been converted to a tight
but usable airplane hangar There is a wide opening at the far
end of the cave -- wide enough to allow planes to fly in or out
and a tripwire on a runway to allow aircraft carrier style
landings

The hangar is stocked with several dozen military fighters of
multinational origin -- Russian American Chinese German The
planes look new -- and well-maintained

BOND

moves through the hangar -- split between awe at this private
armory and horror at what someone like Trevelyan could do with
it Bond stops at one of the planes in the middle of the
hangar - and affixes the Semtex to it

Bond then removes his Rolex -- and takes off the back of it
The rear disc has a spike that extends from the center -- Bond

sticks it into the Semtex -- as --
IN THE MAINTENANCE SHED ABOVE - A PAIR OF GUARDS

have found the maintenance man Bond clobbered -- one gets out
his radio -- as --

IN THE SECOND LEVEL - BOND
pulls back a slide on the disc priming it -- a red light on

the disk is winking slowly but rythmically -- Bond looks to his
watch --

ON THE WATCH - A MATCHING RED LIGHT
is winking in perfect synch with that of the detonator --
BOND

backs away from the plane -- and runs toward the elevator doors
Bond opens the cage doors -- and as the elevator isn’t there he
moves into the shaft and climbs up a service ladder But as he
passes the first level and the elevator stopped there --

from inside the elevator there are the warning clicks of a
pair of machine guns from the quards inside Bond freezes --
and looks up --

-- at the top of the shaft two more guards wait -- both aiming
their guns down at Bond

INT UNDERGROUND COMPLEX - HALLWAY

This has a decidedly more high-tech look about it than the caves
-- with a pair of guards flanking him Bond is led from the
elevator entrance and through a hall to --

THE MAIN COMPUTER ROOM - BOND

is led down to the center of the tower of computer monitors --
where Trevelyan is waiting Whatever annoyance Trevelyan feels
at Bond’s presence is ultimately overcome by the fact that it
was expected -- and the fact that Bond is at his mercy

TREVELYAN
James Bond
(notes tattered appearance)
Even Rasputin had the courtesy to die
after the fourth attempt on his life
(beat)
Where is Miss Varoskaya

BOND
(grim)
Dead
Trevelyan doesn’t believe him -- he nods to a pair of guards
who exit
TREVELYAN

She will be soon enough

Bond steps further into the center of the computer room taking
it all in

BOND
Your armory is impressive Trevelyan But
I wouldn’t have bought so many Russian
airplanes

TREVELYAN

(casual)
Oh I have American weaponry as well It’s
as easy to find I’m stocking them here
and in several other locations for --

(searches for phrase)
-- an opportune moment The world is
changing James We must change with it

(beat)
I left the British empire just as it
stuttered to a halt -- and I had a
parade-view seat for the end of the Soviet
empire Both of them ended for exactly the
same reason -- for want of money

(beat)
It’s time to think perhaps about
building a new one With the money I’m
about to receive I will be prepared when
the next opportunity comes

Bond smiles pityingly at Trevelyan

BOND
It’s rather sad Augustus You used to
D have quite a mind

(eyes computer screens)
International banking codes -- you’re
preparing to launder your money a little
prematurely I think

(turns back to Trevelyan)

You can’t be so far gone that you think
you’ll actually be able to keep it Our
service will follow the delivery boy right
to your doorstep

(condescending)

At any rate I think you’11 find that ten
billion dollars hasn’t been adequate
empire-building capital for at least a
century

Trevelyan responds to this baiting with a booming laugh —-

TREVELYAN
Ten billion
(amused)
James -- you have lost your imagination
Bond eyes Trevelyan -- and the computers -- considering the
factors --
BOND
You’ve set up wire transfers to Tokyo

Bern the Bahamas Stuttgart -- but

they’re all sourced in New York —-
(starting to get it)

-- you have Makvenio’s intercept cipher to

redirect codes --

Bond turns to face a proud grinning Trevelyan as it hits him --

BOND
Of course -- you’ve broken into a
finance computer for a wire theft

Trevelyan moves into the midst of the computers with Bond

TREVELYAN

Credit is due James -- I’ve broken into
the finance computer for the wire
theft The clearing house computer for
overseas wire transactions in the World
Trade Center

(modestly)
I had one of my men in place as new
security protocols were created after the
unfortunate bombing there

D The enormity of it starts to hit Bond --
BOND

They must process over a trillion dollars
worth of wire transactions daily --

TREVELYAN

A trillion and a half But I’m not
greedy James I have my eye on a mere six
hundred billion

(motions around)
These computers can reroute the transfers
into thousands of accounts I control --
and reroute them again through a labyrinth
of deutchmarks yen and francs on the
international currency exchange -- all in
a matter of seconds

BOND

Just before the Tempest goes off over New
York

(Trevelyan nods)
It’1l1 destroy the proof of the theft --
the computer itself -- and all the
recorded data

(beat)
As well as a million people

Trevelyan is genuinely unconcerned

TREVELYAN

A matter of accounting We’re both men
whove had to make decisions about human
lives James What it costs to spare
them -- what it costs to take them -- what
it costs us to make that choice --

(shrugs)
Six hundred billion dollars balanced
against one million lives

(beat)
Merely dust on the globe

BOND
The theft will be traced --

Trevelyan laughs again --

TREVELYAN

To whom To what New York City in
flames from a terrorist attack --
Washington and Moscow scrambling to blame
each other for the incident and cover up
the true cause Searching for deposit
slips in the rubble will be the last thing
on anyone’s mind

(beat)
By tomorrow I1l have withdrawn the money
-- and in fact I expect to make a
handsome profit on the currency exchange

(smiles)
I’m playing a hunch that the dollar will
take a sharp drop this afternoon

Trevelyan turns as the door slides open through the cage
entrance --

AT THE DOOR - MARINA
is being brought in by Savatier and a pair of guards

GUARD
We found her in the west tower -—
(beat)
-- at a computer terminal

TREVELYAN

is rattled -- this is exactly what he’s wanted to prevent all
along He turns to the head technician at the Tempest console

TREVELYAN
Run a systems check -- on everything
(to Savatier)
Stay with the transmitter I don’t want
any more surprises

As Savatier leaves and Trevelyan works on damage control a look
passes between Bond and Marina -- a look that tells us she’s
unsure about how successful her tampering was Bond turns from
her not wanting to give anything away

Trevelyan returns his attention to Bond and Marina his friendly
demeanor vanished

TREVELYAN
I thought I told you early on in your
training James -- never bring a woman

into combat with you When you do you
bring a second heart

(beat)
A second target

A computer beeping turns Trevelyan back around --

TECHNICIAN

(cocky)
I’ve found it --

(as Trevelyan heads over)
-- it’s not very well done She linked the
go code to the satelite’s destruct code
If we signalled it to fire it would have
self-destructed instead

(hits some keys)
But now it’s deleted

TREVELYAN
(regaining composure)
Retarget the satelite for New York
As the technician taps it out we go to --
D THE TEMPEST CONTROL SCREEN

which shows among other things this display --

LOCATION 126235094
PRIMARY TARGET 73094113

As before the location number is starting to roll over rapidly
to match the target location --

IN OUTER SPACE TEMPEST TWO

fires compressed gas jets to speed silently toward the target --
IN THE COMPUTER CENTER - TREVELYAN

steps over to Bond and Marina again in control

TREVELYAN

(to Marina)
I expected more from you But I suppose I
owe you the opportunity to watch the
device you designed go to work After all
I couldn’t have managed this without you

(smiles)
Thank you Miss Varoskaya

ON RANSACTION COMPUTER SCREENS

We MOVE across them to get an idea of the scale of this
operation on this grouping of computer screens over fifty
thousand wire transactions are in place waiting to be
unleashed -- though the transaction figures are in different
denominations none of them are less than five figures --
ON THE VISUAL TRACKING SCREEN FOR TEMPEST

The Tempest Two is moving from a far west far north position
over Canada -- and is tracking south and east rapidly --

-- but to the technician watching this something’s wrong - he
nervously compares the satelite’s visual position with

THE TEMPEST CONTROL COMPUTER SCREEN
which shows

LOCATION 111233917
PRIMARY TARGET 73094113

As we watch the screen and the location number change the
target number also abruptly changes -- to lock in at --

LOCATION 111233917
PRIMARY TARGET 69131720

THE TECHNICIAN
looks up again - worried --

TECHNICIAN
-- the satelite’s trajectory -- it’s off
target --

Trevelyan turns --

TREVELYAN
How far off target

Another technician maps the trajectory on the visual display
screen --

TECHNICIAN 2
It’s headed for us sir --

Trevelyan looks at the visual display screen - which confirms
the truth -- the satelite is already south of New York and is
clearly headed do --

TREVELYAN
(angry)
Then shut it down -- and retarget --
TECHNICIAN
(bewildered)
- the access codes have been altered --
As this is going on Bond looks down at his watch -- the rythmic
flashing of the signal light has grown more rapid --
IN THE SECOND LEVEL - THE DETONATOR
on the block of Semtex is flashing at the same quickened pace --

IN THE CONTROL ROOM - TREVELYAN

furiously turns around to face Bond and Marina - Marina eyes
him directly --

MARINA
You’re welcome --
IN THE SECOND LEVEL - THE DETONATOR’S FLASHING LIGHT

becomes constant -- the detonator sparks the Semtex --

“- and detonates taking out the two nearest airplanes
creating a chain reaction of explosions in the hangar --

IN THE CONTROL ROOM

The effects of the blast are felt as the room rocks as if hit
by an earthquake -- catching everyone unaware -- except Bond --

-- Bond slams the guard behind him off his feet -- as the one

in front of him aims his gun Bond stiff-arms his chin with

enough force to break his neck -- the guard sprawls backward
into one of the banking computer terminals --

-- Bond grabs Marina’s hand and runs for the cage door -- as -

-- the first guard Bond knocked to the floor aims his machine
gun at them and fires a burst --

-- Bond’s left arm is hit but he and Marina make it behind
some of the computer machinery -- so no more shots are fired --
and they escape through the cage door

With the sound of another BLAST there is panic in the room --
technicians start to shout and get up -- but Trevelyan maintains
control -

TREVELYAN
(shouting)
Stay where you are --
(to head technician)
-- and undo whatever’s she’s done --
quickly --
(still sure of victory)
We have time

IN THE RISING ELEVATOR - BOND AND MARINA

Grimacing in pain Bond checks his arm -- the bullet’s gone
through Not a mortal wound but it’s already been a tough
morning Bond turns to Marina -- and manages a smile -

BOND
(through pain)
Nicely done Another intercept code

MARINA
(nods)
With an encryption on it so they can’t
reaccess the satelite --
(worried)
James -- your arm --

BOND
(cuts her off)
Is there a chance they can break through
that code and retarget the satelite

MARINA
The Tempest will get here in five
minutes --
(upset)
-- if they’re fast enough -- they might

OQUTER VIEW OF ISLAND - A CLIFF WALL

near the hangar explodes with devastating seismic force --
rattling one of the support towers --

THE TRANSMITTER CATWALK

- the support towers dangerously sway as if there were an
earthquake -- some of the metalwork of the upper transmitter
creaks and breaks -- and there’s a whipsaw effect on the
catwalk -- the catwalk’s side guide lines snap as the bottom
of it is thoroughly shaken --

a guard who was standing where the catwalk meets the
transmitter is thrown to his death -- as he falls he drops his
machine gun on the transmitter’s platform --

-- the guard falls five hundred feet into the dish -- his body
shattering a segment of the dish and punching a hole in it --

AT THE HILLSIDE ENTRANCE - BOND AND MARINA

Marina helps a weakened Bond out of the entrance —- in front of
them is the catwalk -- and the dangerously swinging
transmitter Bond looks ahead determined taking Marina’s arm
off him --

BOND
I have to make certain that Trevelyan
can’t transmit out

MARINA
James -- when the Tempest fires that
whole platform will be electrified --
you can’t --

BOND
(sharp)
There’s no other way -

Bond stops -- and softens a bit Resigned He knows there’s no
way he can get back off that platform alive

BOND
After it’s over -- find the helicopter
Try to radio out for help

With his good arm Bond draws Marina into a passionate kiss --
clearly a goodbye kiss Bond abruptly breaks it off -- Marina
ean only watch as he runs down the hill and

ONTO THE UNRAVELLING CATWALK

-- the guidelines on the side are useless as they’re severed
and dangling in several spots -- the bottom planks are pitching
up and down --

-- Bond weaves left and right to maintain his balance as he runs
toward the transmitter -- as he looks ahead he sees

BOND’S POV - SAVATIER

is ahead of him -- inside the girders of the triangular
configuration of the transmitter waiting for Bond as
unconcerned by his arrival as he is by the fact that the
transmitter is swinging all over --

-- the transmitter nonetheless is doing its thing -- the
half-moon segment of girders at the bottom is rotating around
a circular track for better brodcasting position --

-- Bond’s POV shifts up to the end of the catwalk above
Savatier where the loose gun slides on the edge of the
swaying catwalk --

BOND

staggers faster across the pitching catwalk to reach the
platform’s edge -- the gun slides along from side to side -- its
stock catches on the edge -

-- and finally the gun clatters off the platform as --
VIEW DOWN - BOND

desperately dives for it flattening out on the platform -- his
arm stretches down for it his fingers just brush it as it
falls irretrievably into the dish --

-- and Savatier appears in the girders under him -- he reaches
up grabs Bond’s arm and drags him down to hurl him against
the girders --

BOND

painfully collides against one of the upper triangular girders
the wind knocked out of him --

-- and he falls onto the circular rotation track of the

dish dazed and unmoving as the barrel-sized quide wheels
advance GRINDING toward him with enough force and weight to
erush him --

IN COMPUTER CONTROL ROOM - THE HEAD TECHNICIAN

is hacking his way through a maze of programming codelines -
Trevelyan watching over his shoulder --

TECHNICIAN
(sweating it)
Almost there --
(a few taps)
-- the blocking code’s off --
(more tapping)
-- starting the cancellation coding
sequence --

ON THE CIRCULAR RAILING - BOND

clears his head enough to roll out of the way of the advancing
wheel -- and into the moving half-moon girders underneath --

SAVATIER

easily swings down after him -- obviously in better shape than
Bond at the moment -- as --

IN THE HALF-MOON GIRDERS - BOND
gets his footing underneath the advancing wheel on the girders
there -- and testing a loosened steel bar YANKS it free -- and
shoves it up between the steel wheel and the guide rail --

the machinery GRINDS loudly trying to keep moving -- but it
comes to a reluctant stop as the engines keep pushing --

LONG SHOT OF HALF MOON GIRDERS

as they stop their rotation under the trangular section -- we
can Savatier is swinging down closer to Bond -- but

IN THE HALF-MOON GIRDERS - BOND
rapidly climbs down the girders to try to get to the fan

antenna at the end -- the broadcast point -- Savatier is close
behind --

CLOSE ON TEMPEST CONTROL COMPUTER SCREEN

The targeting and location numbers are rapidly intersecting --
lower text on the screen shows the words --

MISSION ABORT SIGNAL - TRANSMITTING
-- but this is followed on screen by a blinking --

SIGNAL INCOMPLETE
IN THE COMPUTER CONTROL ROOM - THE TECHNICIAN

is sweating -- things should be going his way now -- but -

TECHNICIAN
(really worried now)
There’s some kind of interference --

TREVELYAN
(furious)
Enter it again --

AT THE EDGE OF THE HALF-MOON GIRDERS - CLOSE ON BOND

who is the source of interference -- bracing himself at the
pointed edge of the half-moon girders he kicks open a

junction box which starts sparking -- he kicks at it again --
but Savatier arrives -- and delivers a powerful fly-swatting

backhand that sends Bond reeling against the opposite
girders -- as --

IN THE CIRCULAR RAILWAY ABOVE

-- both of the guide motors overheat and smoke straining
against the blockage --

IN THE HALF-MOON GIRDERS - BOND

is stunned -- but he’s also had enough -- adrenalin kicks in as
Savatier rushes him -- Bond grabs the girders above him and
braces to powerfully kick Savatier in the chest knocking him
back against the opposite girders --

-- behind them the junction box on the antenna sends up a jet
of sparks - it’s shorting out -

IN OUTER SPACE - THE TEMPEST

satelite’s gas jets cut off as it coasts to firing position -
its shape detonation cone fans out --

IN COMPUTER CONTROL CENTER - TREVELYAN

sees evidence everywhere that it’s over -- numbers are ticking
closer on the screen the visual tracker shows it’s right
overhead --

TREVELYAN
(furious)
Shut it down Now

TECHNICIAN
(panicked)
-- it’s impossible --

Trevelyan backs away from the console bearing a striking
resemblance to a captain on a rapidly sinking ship -- the
technicians at the other consoles panic and abandon their
terminals --

WITHIN THE HALF-MOON GIRDERS - SAVATIER

shakes off Bond’s kick and decides it’s time to finish the
job -- he crosses back to Bond and pins him against a girder
his forearm pressing firmly against Bond’s windpipe --

-- above them --

ILWAY

-- the engines straining against the blocked guide wheel win
out -- the wheel moves past the blockage --

LONG SHOT OF HALF-MOON GIRDERS

as they whip around the circular track a lot faster than
they’re supposed to --

INSIDE THE HALF-MOON GIRDERS - SAVATIER AND BOND
are knocked away from the girder -- and are thrown about like

dice in a cage -- Bond grabs hold of a side girder for
support - as --

ON THE CIRCULAR RAILWAY - THE BRAKES
that hold the half-moon locked in place give and -- there are
four of them -- as the first one snaps --

LONG SHOT OF HALF-MOON GIRDERS

as the whole thing starts to slide off their rollers the
entire thing is coming loose from the circular railway -- as
the second set of brakes snaps --

INSIDE THE HALF-MOON GIRDERS - BOND

keeps hold of the girder as the whole configuration accelerates
its slide down and off the track -- we hear the sound of the
third set of brakes snap -- as it picks up speed it runs
through the fourth and final set of brakes --

THE HALF-MOON GIRDERS COMPLETELY CLEAR THE TRACK

and are falling into the dish their speed taking them under
and parallel to the catwalk --

INSIDE THE FALLING GIRDERS - BOND

moves closer to the point -- and as the girders sail past a
severe ide line d ing from the catw --

-- Bond leaps off the girders and toward the line -- he grabs
it swinging to the side holding on with one hand and lashing
the rope around his forearm with the other -- as --

CLOSE ON TEMPEST CONTROL COMPUTER SCREEN

as the targeting and location numbers lock into place —-

IN OUTER SPACE THE TEMPEST

stabilizes -- aims the cone down -- and detonates -- as --
OVER THE DISH - BOND

helplessly dangles on the catwalk’s line --

-- under him the half-moon is still falling diving like a
downed plane --

WIDE VIEW OF DISH AS THE TEMPEST’S DETONATION

sets the sky on fire with a deafening BLAST -- and the
electromagnetic surge flashes toward the island and into the
dish --

-- electrifying every exposed metal surface -- lightning
cracks everywhere in whats left of the transmitter skeleton --
an electrical blue surge shoots down around the metal dish --

BOND

is still swinging from the rope surrounded by lightning
strikes -- as --

THE FALLING HALF-MOON GIRDERS

are totally electrified -- Savatier is electrocuted inside
the girders as they finally CRASH through the dish -- and
beyond -- ot

INTO THE CONTROL CENTER

-- as the three hundred ton mesh of steel rips through the
concrete caving in the roof the Faraday cage and the computer
center itself -- hitting the Tempest control computer dead
center --

-- the Tempest’s lightning surges through the room killing
technicians blowing up equipment --

ON THE BANKING MONITORS

Over a hundred screens crowded with six hundred billion dollars
worth of electronic cash on it explode --

UPABOVE THE DISH - BOND
dangles from the still-swinging line -- the worst of the surge
is already over -- there is random electrical crackling in the

transmitter and the dish itself -- but Bond’s problems are not
over --

THE REST OF THE TRANSMITTER

has been further weakened by all this - loud CREAKING and
SNAPPING of lines and girders signal an imminent fall --

-- Bond can do nothing but hang on as the line gives dropping
him in rapid ten foot increments down and back to the dish’s
edge --

ON THE CATWALK - THE LINE

is tearing loose toward a point where it’s severed again -- in
other words Bond is about to start freefall --

- the line tears loose --

WIDE SHOT ON BOND FALLING

near the edge of the dish at least thirty feet down the
useless line trailing above him -- until --

-- Bond slams into a panel twenty feet down from the dish’s
edge and starts sliding down the panels toward the center
out of control --

-- Bond grabs onto the mesh of a dish panel braking himself
just over an explosion that bursts out of the ground and
through the dish shattering panels and hurling them into the
air - as this goes on below Bond above him --

T s TFORM
is ready to go -- support lines from the towers snap --
IN THE DISH —- BOND

is in the shadow of the transmitter platform as he runs up the
dish’s slope which grows steeper as he gets closer to the
edge --

AT THE DISH’S EDGE - MARINA

sees Bond - she runs along the top of a barrier at the dish’s
edge to get to his position grabbing a downed line from the
transmitter -- as --

LONG SHOT - THE TRANSMITTER PLATFORM

finally falls -- as does the nearest crumbling support tower
-- with the wreckage of the catwalk streaming after it three

hundred tons of steel impacts against the far end of the dish

punching a fifty foot hole into the dish and through the
xplodi levels of the compo --

VIEW DOWN ON BOND

-- who is clinging to a panel thirty feet above the new hole
hanging on desperately against the shockwave which is sending
other panels flying loose to tumble into the new hole --

-- Bond looks up as a line lands alongside him --
BOND’S POV MARINA

has thrown it down from the barrier’s edge trying to secure
it -- but as she does -

Trevelyan hoves into view behind her - looking disheveled

from his escape from the lower levels -- but more than that he
looks enraged -- he forcefully grabs Marina by her arm -- and
intensely locks eyes with Bond as he holds her over the edge --

TREVELYAN
Tell me James -- do you ever tire of
watching the women you love die

Trevelyan hurls her over the edge of the dish --
INSIDE THE DISH - MARINA PLUMMETS

past Bond just beyond his outstretched arm before she hits
the aluminum panels and tumbles rolling down the dish’s
slope toward the jagged edges of the hole and beyond --

VIEW OVER THE HOLE - MARINA

falls into the hole and is ensnared in a tangle of the
catwalk’s shredded lines a very uncertain net over the
surging flames and the two hundred foot drop below her -- the
catwalk is snagged on two ends -- Marina’s weight pulls one of
the ends free swinging her down toward the flames --

BOND

furious takes the line thrown down by Marina and fiercely

yanks it down --

-- the line tangles around Trevelyan’s ankle -- pulling him
off balance and rolling him into the sloping dish --

ON DISH — TREVELY DBOND

-- Trevelyan rolls toward Bond and collides with him -- both
men roll down out of control to the last intact panels at the
jagged edge of the hole --

- Trevelyan lands on his side and brakes himself - stunned
but not too badly -- Bond on the other hand lands awkwardly
and painfully on a metal protrusion with a jolt against his
bullet wound -- an advantage Trevelyan presses --

-- Trevelyan braces himself on the panel and moves closer to
sadistically kick Bond in the face -- we can see that

THE PANELS

they’re fighting on are loose and can give at any time --
as --

DANGLING IN THE HOLE — INA UGGLES IN ECATWA

like a fly in a web -- she starts to move up but a new
explosion surges flames toward her and shoots debris around
her -- the bottom line of the catwalk ignites and starts to
burn up --

BOND AND TREVELYAN - ON THE PANELS

Bond stabilizes and punches Trevelyan back against a panel --
Bond’s effort and Trevelyan’s impact both loosen the panels
further --

-- bloodied Trevelyan steadies against the panel -- and draws
out his pistol to fire at Bond --

-- but Bond throws everything he’s got left into a final
powerful kick at the corner of the panel Trevelyan’s on --

-- the last bit of metal holding it onto the dish bursts --
TREVELYAN’S PANEL

tears loose and plunges off the edge into the hole and the
flames -- as he starts a two hundred foot fall --

BOND

looks down clinging to his panel -- which is close to going as
well --

BOND’S POV - TREVELYAN FALLING INTO THE HOLE

-- he’s just one more bit of debris as a new huge explosion
FLARES up an annihilating fireball that consumes him one
hundred feet down -

ON THE EDGE OF THE HOLE - BOND

climbs up to a slightly more secure panel -- and looks to

NA- ON CATW SHREDS
-- she’s climbing up -- but her swinging is loosening the few
strands supporting her as the catwalk burns underneath her --
BOND
runs across the panels -- jumping gaps and evading panels that

are collapsing just in time to throw himself at the edge of
the hole -

-- Bond flattens on the edge of the panel and extends his good
arm -- the wrecked panel is being tested not just by his weight
but Marina’s and that of the segment of catwalk --

-- Marina gets far enough up the strands to grab Bond’s hand
as -

THE CATWALK’S SUPPORTING STRANDS

tear off and fall away underneath her --

-- the entire catwalk spirals into the fiery abyss --

-- but Bond maintains his grip on Marina -- she grabs hold of
the jagged panel with another hand and climbs up onto the shaky
panel with Bond --

WIDE ON DISH - BOND AND MARINA

move up the dish as quickly as possible as the explosions
intensify BLASTING through the hole --

- they get to the edge -- and climb over the barrier --

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DISH EDGE BARRIER

D -- Bond helps Marina over -- as the sounds of blasts rumble
through the dish and under them --
- Marina looks like she’s in shock -- but Bond knows there’s no
time to waste and pulls Marina toward a gap in the hillside --
BOND
(shouting)

Come on -- this way --
As they run through the gap --
IN T ORY SUBLEV - EXPLOSIVE CRATES

are starting to go -- one segment detonates as above --

IN THE ROCK CLEARING - WIDE SHOT

- we see that this is perched exactly over the armory --
blasts rip through the ground making this look like a
minefield under siege -- at the far end of it is the helicopter
which is momentarily intact --

-- entering at the other end are --
BOND AND MARINA

D -- Bond leads Marina through a very dangerous hundred yard dash
zig-zagging through the new explosions ripping through the
earth and the fire and chasms left by the older ones -

finally they reach the helicopter and get in --
INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - BOND

allows himself a look of relief -- a premature one -- as he
pushes a start button -- nothing happens -- he jabs it
again --

BOND
Congratulations -- you’ve downed your
first American aircraft --
(tense)
-- the pulse has knocked out the
electronics

MARINA
But this has hardened circuitry --

BOND
Not hard enough apparently --
(sees switch)
-- there’s an auxilliary --

D Bond hits that switch -- and there is a wonderful sound of
electronics humming to life -- but Bond looks down --

THE CONSOLE -THE SYSTEMS MONITOR

has come to life -- with one word -- a blinking --
WAIT
IN THE ARMORY SUBLEVEL THE EXPLOSIVES
are not going to wait -- crates of explosive are going off

sequentially down a row --
WIDE SHOT ON CLEARING - THE EXPLOSIONS

are tracking in a straight unmistakable path toward the
helicopter --

INSIDE THE HELICOPTER - BOND

is trying not to look at them -- his attention is focused on
THE SYSTEMS MONITOR

which reads SYSTEM REBOOTING

with a bar graph 37 COMPLETED

MARINA

looks out her window -- which isn’t reassuring either --
ACHASM

is forming in the rock due to collapsing rock -- that too is

fast advancing toward the ground the helicopter is perched on --
BOND

is sweating it -- his eyes are locked on the monitor screen his
finger frozen on the start button -- until --

-- a BEEP and the bargraph announce that the system is
rebooted --

- Bond instantaneously pushes the start button --
-- and the rotors WHINE to life -- slowly picking up speed --
ON THE HELICOPTER - AS THE GROUND OPENS UP UNDER IT

-- the rotors create enough lift for the copter to rise up
slowly instead of fall down fast --

-- Bond throttles the copter out and up through the smoke and
flames outracing the advancing explosions -- as --

LONG SHOT OF ISLAND

Everything left over in the armory goes up in a massive
fireball -- as Bond’s helicopter flies out toward the other
islands -- and safety -- we --

INT NATO COMMANDCONTROL CENTER - DAY

In the monitoring center there’s a bustle of activity as the
tracking screen shows that Tempest has been fired -- Orbach
rushes up to M and Q with the details --

ORBACH
Well if it had to go off we couldn’t
have picked a better place --
(checks paper)
-- sixty-nine longitude seventeen
latitude -- right over the far end of the
Caribbean

M
My God -- that’s where 007s gone --

Q

(equally worried)
If the Tempest was fired there there’s no
electricity -- no telephones -- no
communications of any kind --

(this sounds awful to Q)
- heaven only knows what survival
conditions he’s being forced to deal with

EXT CARIBBEAN HILLSIDE - PRIVATE BUNGALOW - NIGHT

We MOVE in over a striking view of the hills and ocean from the
back deck flickering candlelight the only illumination -- past
trays of fruit and lobster on one table and a cocktail shaker
dewed with condensation on another --

BOND (0S)
Now this is intolerable --

Finally we reach
BOND AND MARINA - RECLINED IN A HAMMOCK
bandaged and rested in casual island clothes the candle
burning on the rail behind them Bond’s dismayed look is for his
martini glass --

BOND

I told the barman -- shaken not
stirred
MARINA
(laughing at him)
What is the difference
BOND

Bruised vermouth -
(smiles)

I know you’re Russian -- but don’t you
appreciate the finer things in life

MARINA
No James --

Marina takes Bond‘s martini hand and guides it toward the

rail -- pulling him closer to her --

MARINA
(smiles)
- I just appreciate a smooth ride
Bond returns the smile -- he moves over her and
extinguishing the candle with the martini glass
the rail -- off the darkness we retreat to a -
