MAGGIES PLAN

by

Rebecca Miller

Based on a story by Karen Rinaldi
EXT GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET - DAY 1

MAGGIE We see the back of her blonde head It’s a beautiful
winter day Now we see her from across the street We see her
feet making determined strides This is a young woman who
knows where she is going

Wide shot A blind man is tentatively making ready to cross
the street

Among the handful of pedestrians about to cross Maggie is
the only one to notice and helps the man across

EXT PRODUCE MARKET - DAY 2

TONY Maggie’s best friend looks a little like Art Garfunkel
as a young man fluffy hair glasses dressed in a suit
jacket and baggy chinos He’s pushing a stroller with a
reading fluffy-haired bespectacled four year old boy in it
wearing a t-shirt with “IMAGINE THERE’S NO FRACKING” written
on the front This boy is too big to be in a stroller and
too young to be reading Maggie rushes to them

MAGGIE
Sorry Sorry I’m late Hi Hi
Max
She snuffles the little boy’s neck
MAGGIE (CONT’D)
You still have one little corner of
baby smell Right (sniff) there

Max giggles and pushes her away so he can get back to his
reading Maggie straightens up

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
Ach I need a baby

She bites her fist
TONY
You need a baby You’re such an

impatient little fuss-budget

MAGGIE
I just don’t see why I should wait

TONY
For a father perhaps

( )

MAGGIE
Let’s face it I’ve never been in a
serious relationship that lasted
longer than six months

TONY

(paying)
We were together for two years

They walk

MAGGIE
In college And we made each other
miserable for the rest of the time

TONY
I admit it We were miserable But
we were also happy

MAGGIE
Yeah

They reach a stand of homemade jams Tony picks one up

TONY
Just so you know I have little
sperm tucked away in a facility
uptown if you’re in a pinch

MAGGIE
What Why I thought Felicia
didn’t want any more kids

TONY
Felicia does not want any more
kids I froze it in case I ever
meet anybody nice

MAGGIE
No you didn’t

TONY
I didn’t But I might you know
save it like ‘mad money’-style

Maggie has something to tell Tony and she wants to get it
over with fast

MAGGIE
(rushing this part)
Do you remember Guy Childers from
college

( ) 2
A moment as Tony searches for the name in his mind

TONY
Wasn’t he the Guyhe’s a pickle
salesman

MAGGIE
He’s a pickle entrepreneur And--
he’s agreed to make a donation so
I can inseminate myself

TONY
But he has no sense of personal
space

MAGGIE

So what He was a math major
Anyway I’m not marrying him I’m
borrowing his genes

TONY
But not his personality I hope Guy
Childers

MAGGIE
(shrugs )
Everybody has something a little
wrong with them You think
everybody’s honest who fills out
those questionnaires at the sperm
bank

TONY

I can’t believe you’ve been cooking
this up all this time and you
didn’t even tell me

MAGGIE
I knew that you’d yell at me

TONY

I’m not yelling at you Isn’t this
sort of thing for women who are
like forty-nine and desperate

MAGGIE
I don’t want it to be a last
resort I want it to be a choice
(MORE )

( )

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Because I’m ready be a mother

and

I don’t believe Ill find a man who
I can stay in love with-- or who
can stay in love with me-- for more
than six months I’m just facing

the truth about myself
Tony is morose at this news but he acce

TONY

pts it

So when’s the insemination Are we

gonna have a party

MAGGIE
In four months

As they walk away from camera

TONY
Do I have bad breath

He breaths into the air near her mouth

MAGGIE
No Do I

She breathes into his mouth

TONY
No

And they walk off Good friends unusual

INT GUY CHILDERS’ BROOKLYN PICKLE FACTO

She sniffs

friends

RY -— DAY

Hipsters in hats and Mexican technicians are creating pickles
in huge vats GUY is walking Maggie through aisle after aisle
of pickles Guy is wearing a Peruvian hat with flaps shorts

and clogs

GUY
I started production in my

apartment three years ago Now I
have twelve employees and I just

got an order from Whole Foods

If

that works out we’re taking off
But I’m still very hands on Every
pickle has my stamp of approval on

it

He withdraws a pickle from a vat

( )

GUY (CONTD)
Here try this one

MAGGIE

I love this
GUY

That’s the Bavarian Classic
MAGGIE

This is the best pickle I’ve ever

had
Guy looks at her beaming

Jump cut

INT FRONT DESK - DAY

Guy and Maggie are at the front desk of Brooklyn
takes off his gloves as Maggie notices a pair of
skates hanging from a coat stand

MAGGIE
You skate

GUY
Every Sunday I grew up on the ice

MAGGIE
Oh right You were on the ice
hockey team

GUY
Yeah

MAGGIE
I used to skate a lot when I was
little

A moment of awkwardness

GUY
So regarding our plan Here is
my bill of health

Brine Guy
hockey

With an air of pride he spreads his blood test results

across the desk

GUY (CONTD)
Read it

( )

MAGGIE
(scanning the results)
That’s great

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
Oh I have for you

Maggie takes an empty plastic specimen jar out of her purse

GUY
Ah

He takes it and looks into it as if for an answer

MAGGIE
You need to keep it warm when
youso just put it next to your
body underneath your shirtand
you can come right over

GUY
Okay

Guy places the jar on the desk They look at it together

GUY (CONT’D)
So when do you want to do this

MAGGIE
Marchtwenty third

Guy thinks about his schedule No conflicts come to mind

MAGGIE (CONTD)
I just want to build up some more
savings

Guy pulls out a stool for Maggie solicitously in
anticipation perhaps of her pregnancy

GUY
That’s smart

MAGGIE
I have insurance and everything
So I guess the question is how
much involvement do you want I was
going to suggest none but I’m open
to negotiation

A beat as Guy digests this

( )
A3

GUY
None isso cool It kind of takes
the pressure off doesn’t it

He takes a seat and leans back against the refrigerator
beside a large circulating fan

GUY (CONTD)
I can just relax and build my
empire
The fan blows Guy’s STD bloodtest result paper across his
desk they both move to stop it and their fingers touch

behind the desk with the air of a sage

MAGGIE
Hi Beverly I got two checks this
month Not that I’m complaining

BEVERLY
You sure they’re not for two
different payments

MAGGIE
I would love to think that but
they have the same date on them and
I was paid last month

JOHN
Excuse me

( )

The camera pans right to include a shambolic sleep-deprived

edgy man

JOHN (CONT’D)
I couldn’t help but overhear this
young woman got two checks And I
don’t have any

Beverly looks up at him displeased at this complication

BEVERLY
What’s your name

JOHN
John Harding

MAGGIE
Oh well my name is Johanna Hardin
I mean my name is Maggie but on
the check it’s Johanna Margaret
Hardin So maybe there was a mix-
up

Beverly is on the computer She looks a little put
hates this kind of thing

BEVERLY
Yep And it’s gonna take a minute
to figure this out

JOHN
It would be great if it could be
resolved soon

Beverly looks up at him with her final answer

INT NEW SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY 10

That’s so funny that you know John
Harding
FELICIA

(eating her soup)
We’re on a committee together He’s
a real panty melter Why

MAGGIE
No we just -- had a check mix-up
recently -- because of our names--
HardinHarding

FELICIA

He’s one of the bad-boys of Ficto-
critical Anthropology Apparently
he was a big deal in Chicago And
now he just does adjunct work here
but they’re really salivating for
him to teach full-time

MAGGIE
Why won’t he

FELICIA
I don’t know I think it has
something to do with his wife
She’s some kind of monster
apparently

MAGGIE
Where did you hear this

( )

FELICIA
(shrugging)
Around She’s got tenure at
Columbia Georgette Nergaard The
words ‘Glacial’ and ‘Terrifying’

have been bandied about Then again

I’ve heard myself described as a
psychotic bitch but I think I’m
actually pretty nice so you
can’t believe everything you hear

Maggie is distracted by John’s voice

JOHN
-if you say ‘she was like
terrified’ it’s nothing compared
to saying‘ she was terrified’
Like” is a language condom Trust
me

Maggie looks back at John now a far more mysterious

character
FELICIA

(searching in her salad)
Where the fuck is my chicken

EXT WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - FOUNTAIN - DAY

John is nursing a coffee sitting on a bench reading the
paper when he notices Maggie who is circling the fountain
with vigorous calisthenic strides He watches her circle a

couple times Calls out

JOHN
Hey Hardin

MAGGIE
Oh hi

JOHN

What are you doing

MAGGIE
I’m taking a little constitutional
before my next meeting

John gets up and walks over to her

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Did you get paid yet

( )

11 11

JOHN

MAGGIE
Youre kidding

JOHN
Beverly tells me the check is
coming any day now

Maggie and John walk past a man in a fancy suit kneeling to
scoop up his dog’s turd

JOHN (CONTD)

I knew this Masai from Tanzania He
was here to run in the Marathon He
took everything in New York City in
complete stride Nothing fazed him
until he saw a grown man following
his dog picking up its shit He
started laughing so hard he wept

MAGGIE
I guess that-- custom-- would be
strange like out of context
Whoops

JOHN
What

MAGGIE
I overheard part of your
conversation About ‘like’ being a -
- language prophylactic

He’s trying to remember saying that

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
What is ficto-critical
anthropology anyway

JOHN
It’s a way of writing about
anthropology that blends
ethnographic observation story
telling and like theory

A beat Two smiles

( )

11 11

JOHN (CONTD)
Do we have to walk in a circle or
are we allowed walk around the
park

MAGGIE
We’re allowed

They begin to meander

MAGGIE (CONTD)
(curious about him)
It’s so hard to find a full-time
position

JOHN
When my wife Georgette was
offered a tenured position at
Columbia I decided to put off a
job search just teach a few
classes and finally try to write
this novel I’ve had in my head for
years

They pass two bomb squad-looking men sharing a joke

MAGGIE
(intrigued)
So are you getting a lot of work
done on your novel

JOHN
They say every relationship has a
gardener and a rose Georgette is
definitely the rose

MAGGIE
And you’re the gardener

JOHN
And I don’t have a green thumb

MAGGIE
Maybe you’re a rose in disguise

JOHN
It would be a very good disguise

They walk along for a moment
JOHN (CONTD)

She’s wonderful It’s just she’s
kind of destroying my life

( )

11 11

Maggie isn’t sure how to respond to this remark dropped as a
kind of aside as John ambles along

MAGGIE

JOHN
No no It’s just been a bad week
(looking up at the sky) It’s
turning into a beautiful day

They come to a man performing Shakespearean soliloquies for
donations

ACTOR
Content with Hermia No I do
repentThe tedious minutes I with
her have spent Not Hermia but
Helena I loveWho would not change
a raven for a dove

John gives him a dollar

ACTOR (CONT’D)
Thanks man

13 EXT WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - BENCH - MINUTES LATER 13

A few minutes later They have cupcakes and are sitting on
the same bench John was on earlier They are mid-
conversation

JOHN
We have two of those Best part of
my life Who’s your guy

MAGGIE
No guy Actually the man I’ve
asked to be the father is named
Guy coincidentally

John tears a bite off
MAGGIE (CONTD)
(laughing)

You eat like Mr Fox

JOHN

( )

13 13

MAGGIE
There was a Roald Dahl book And
then it was a movie--

JOHN
Oh yeah My kids loved that movie

Maggie looks at her watch

JOHN (CONTD)
I really like what you’re doing
though--having a baby by yourself
Not that it won’t be hard because
it’s gonna be fucking hard But I
admire your courage And I love

babies

MAGGIE
I just don’t like leaving my
destiny

JOHN

To destiny

MAGGIE
Right

The Shakespearean actor from the park walks by them still in
his ruff He is with another man who is silent furious

ACTOR
(tearful)
But where will I go

The other man shrugs The Actor runs after his lover

ACTOR (CONTD)
You can’t just kick me out of our
house

JOHN
(to Maggie)
I have a question for you

MAGGIE
Yes

JOHN
Would you consider reading a
chapter of my novel

MAGGIE
Sure

( )

13 13

JOHN
I know that’s weird I really want
the first reader to be likeYou
know how you said you’re a bridge
between art and commerce Well I
need a bridge

MAGGIE
Perfect Give it to me I’ll read
it

John reaches into his backpack and pulls out about fifty
pages of a novel

JOHN
You really will I really would
appreciate it

Maggie takes it

MAGGIE
I don’t mind at all

She looks at her watch

MAGGIE (CONTD)
I gotta go Shoot

John looks at his watch
JOHN
(panicked)
Oh shit Shit Shit I gotta go I
gotta go

MAGGIE
Oh--

He grabs his bag and runs off

JOHN
Ill see you later Thank you

MAGGIE
(baffled calling after
him)
Okay Bye
14 INT COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - STAGE - DAY 14

John rushes to the wings and into a big close up as he looks
out at the stage with trepidation

( )

14 14
JOHN
(under his breath)
Fuck
KLIEGLER

What do you make of the use of
masks in the Occupy movement

High shot see John stride onto the stage GEORGETTE John’s
beautiful Danish wife and a moderator KLIEGLER have
started this panel on MASKS IN POLITICS without him His seat
is rudely empty As John does his walk of shame across the
stage Georgette speaks in a clipped Danish accent

GEORGETTE
The masked revolutionary is a
direct inversion of the face of the
demagogue-- the essentially fascist
ideal of the magnetic individual

As John passes Georgette gives him an extremely dirty look

JOHN
(into the mic)
Sorry I’m late

Laughter because he’s so damn charismatic Georgette isn’t
laughing

KLIEGLER
(holding up John’s book)
John Harding author of many books
most recently “Rituals of
Commodity Fetishism at the Tail End
of the Empire”

Applause He’s popular

KLIEGLER (CONT’D)
So John of course we have been
discussing the Occupy movement--

GEORGETTE
I can’t help mentioning the irony
that Warner Brothers owns the
copyright on the V for Vendetta
mask that became the face of the
Occupy movement

( )

14 14

JOHN
Like it or not in this country
the most potent totemic symbols
are cinematic or television-based
so it only makes sense that a
radical popular movement would try
to subvert them

GEORGETTE
Nevertheless the reality of Occupy
is to be found within the
capitalist narrative as a kind of
subplot

JOHN
This sweeping cynicism of yours--

GEORGETTE
If by sweeping cynicism you mean
not living in a dream then shoot
me now

KLIEGLER
Maybe the way we--

JOHN
Nobody ever thinks a revolution is
going to happen until three days
after it’s happened This was a
leaderless movement It wasn’t
going to happen on a schedule This
was a genuine populist uprising

Applause

KLIEGLER
Yes Because--

GEORGETTE
Absolutely But to return to the
use of masks in politics I am more
interested in the possibility of
anonymity and group affiliation --
the “I am Spartacus” maneuver --
which has been the primary tactical
explanation of the use of masks
among various 20th and 21st century
protest movements Including the
Zapatistas the black blocs of the
anti-globalization movement and
of course Pussy Riot

( ) 14

As her speech wears on we see John wilting like a daisy ina
sauna He radiates resentment and defeat

OMITTED 15

INT JOHN AND GEORGETTE’S APARTMENT - EVENING 16

Close up of Georgette’s manicured hand texting We go wide
to reveal a family dinner John is standing serving
Georgette pasta

JOHN
You don’t need to help but could
you please put that down

GEORGETTE
(texting)
One moment

She puts the phone down

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
Okay

John sits JUSTINE 13 in a school uniform sits beside her
dreamy brother PAUL 7

JUSTINE
I don’t get why you say the same
thing in the concluding paragraph
as you do in the opening paragraph

GEORGETTE
Youre repeating your thesis but in
a more developed form

JUSTINE
What’s the point of that

GEORGETTE
By the time you get to the
conclusion you’ve proven your
thesis

JUSTINE
So it’s basically just gloating

JOHN

(amused)
It is a form of gloating yes

( )

16

GEORGETTE
(To John )
They have fleas in Paul’s class
again

JOHN
They don’t have fleas They have
lice

GEORGETTE
Okay lice

JOHN
(to Paul)
Let me check your head

Paul walks over to John John checks his head

JOHN (CONTD)
You don’t have lice

Georgette catches Justine texting

GEORGETTE
No texting at the table

JOHN
I wonder where she gets it

GEORGETTE
I use my phone for work

JOHN
Sometimes I’d like to smash it with
a hammer

GEORGETTE
Ha-ha

Georgette’s phone rings She is dying to answer The kids
both watch their mother restrain herself as John fumes The
phone rings out as Justine speaks

JUSTINE
Way to go Mom

GEORGETTE
Salad

As Georgette serves her phone pings a text She glances at
the text and sucks in air shocked

( ) 16

JOHN
What is it

GEORGETTE
(flushed with excitement)
Theyve asked me to chair the
department at Columbia

JOHN
Congratulations That’s great

GEORGETTE
Itd be a huge time commitment

JOHN
Still it’s a high-class problem

GEORGETTE
When will I ever get my writing
done I’ve promised to deliver that
book by December

Georgette checks her reddening breast bone

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
Come on You’1l get a big bump in

salary--

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
Look -- I’m already breaking out in
a rash

JOHN
I’ve got an idea Why don’t you
call Caleb back and discuss it

GEORGETTE
I have to
JOHN
Justine you want to text your

friend
Justine nods mystified by this change in policy
JOHN (CONTD)
Paul you want to play Ninja

Revinja on your iPad Go

Paul jumps up to get the iPad John pulls out a flip phone

( )

16 16

JOHN (CONTD)
I myself even have a minor text I
would like to respond to We can
skip the pretence of having a close-
knit family dinner (looking down
at his phone)
And we can return to the bullshit
later

Justine texts Georgette is on the phone Close on his text
from Maggie “finished the first chapter”

GEORGETTE
(os)
What is it

17 EXT WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK BENCH - DAY 17
Close on John’s manuscript

MAGGIE
The tone is so unusual - sort of
screwball-surreal Is that right

JOHN
That sounds right Screwball-
surreal That’s it exactly

They are both freezing huddled on their bench

MAGGIE
And oh my God the characters
Martin Neems the colorless postal
worker in 1950’s Connecticut and
he’s married to this crazy
Brazilian woman who keeps breaking
out in rashes It’s hilarious

JOHN
(drinking in her praise)
Really Really
MAGGIE
Oh and the description of the
musical collection

JOHN
Oh yeah his records you mean

MAGGIE
Yes Oh that is so great

( )

JOHN
It’s funny right

MAGGIE
Oh it’s great I’m sorry I am
very very cold I feel like I’m
welded to the bench Is it okay if
we go get some coffee

The camera moves left to a westward path as if it knows

what’s going to happen next

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
(os)
Actually my apartment is like
three blocks from here I just need
to get another sweater I’m deathly

cold
They walk into shot and walk down the path through the frigid
wind
JOHN
I cannot tell you how much I
appreciate you doing this
MAGGIE
Oh it was so much fun to read
JOHN
Really Did you think the boil was
gross or funny
OMITTED

INT MAGGIE’S SUBLET - AFTERNOON

Maggie and John enter gasping with cold The tiny living

room is absolutely crammed with books

MAGGIE
I sublet from a poet

John looks around him at this charming apartment

MAGGIE (CONTD)
You want some tea OrI guess

whiskey It’s a little early

( )

JOHN

JOHN
Hot whiskey

MAGGIE
Oh thank you

She takes a sip

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Oh it’s so good

Medium wide they sit in silence for a moment

JOHN
So Tell me I’m curious about you

Maggie looks up at him

( )

He stands

MAGGIE
What about me What aspect of me

JOHN
Every aspect

MAGGIE
I don’t know where to start

JOHN
How about the beginning

takes off his jacket

JOHN (CONT’D)
I’m hot

MAGGIE
Oh I know

John sits down again

MAGGIE (CONTD)
(drinks)

Well I had a kind of unusual

start

JOHN

MAGGIE
My parents were married fairly
young and they never had kids They
were academics at the University of
Wisconsin Then eventually they got
divorced my Dad moved away but
then later years later they ran
into each other at a party And
they they got together that
night And that’s how I was
conceived On the bed with all the
coats My mom always says that it’s
because I needed to be born

JOHN
I love that idea That our unborn
children are the real gods
dictating the fates of us poor
clueless mortals Did theythey
got together after that

( )

MAGGIE
No My mother raised me on her own
in Madison She was a professor of
nineteenth century British poetry
She wasn’t very practical So I
ended up doing all the day-to-day
stuff I was organizing the bills
by the time I was twelve She came
from a Quaker family so she used
to take me to Quaker meetings with
her I still go sometimes

JOHN
A Quaker

MAGGIE
We had a nice life And then when I
was sixteen she died

Saying it still shocks Maggie and tears glimmer in her eyes

JOHN

MAGGIE
(matter of fact)
So I moved in with my Dad in
Philly

Maggie is surprised to feel that she’s crying

JOHN

How was that
MAGGIE

Um cordial And quiet
JOHN

Sounds lonely

MAGGIE
Yes

He finds her so touching

JOHN
I grew up in a house where
nobody ever stopped yelling at each
other

MAGGIE
(recovering laughing)
Heaven

B22

A moment

He stands 20

JOHN

MAGGIE
(trying to be positive)
My dad is a kind man And he made
the best of it We both did

The atmosphere has changed

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
So what about you Tell me about
you Background-wise

JOHN
My father worked at a blackjack
table in Atlantic City But it’s a
really long story And I have to
get back to my dysfunction

back up Puts on his coat Looks down at her

sitting on the couch

He rushes
falling in

JOHN (CONTD)
I believe it

MAGGIE
What

JOHN
That you had to be born

INT FELICIA AND TONY’S APARTMENT - DAY C22

Maggie looking a little tired but lovely in a tweed skirt
and sweater is eating a carrot as Tony tries to assemble a
piece of IKEA furniture

MAGGIE
It’s short and very strange It
might even be an allegory I like
everything I’ve read He’s asking
me for suggestions

TONY

Oh What does his wife think about
that

( )
C22

C22

MAGGIE
She doesn’t know about it To be
honest I don’t think she pays much
attention to what he does She’s
very self-absorbed She might even
be a narcissist

TONY
Of course she is

MAGGIE
Why of course He’s basically a
psychiatric nurse He can’t write
his novel under those conditions --
I think their marriage fell apart
after the second child was born

INT MAGGIE’S SUBLET - LATE AFTERNOON 24

It’s March twenty-third Guy is taking off his jacket Maggie
looks to see if the pockets are bulging He reaches into a
large pocket and produces a small mashed bouquet

MAGGIE
Oh Thank you

She puts the flowers in a glass then turns expectantly

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Did you bring it

GUY
Oh Fuck I’m sorry

MAGGIE
That’s why I gave you the little
container

GUY
Where’s your bathroom

( )

24

MAGGIE
Um

Guy looks around the room

GUY
So what do I deposit my genetic
gold mine into

Maggie rushes over to her cupboard and takes out a little
plastic jar like the first one she gave him

MAGGIE
(handing it to him)
It’s sterile

Guy holds it between his thumb and forefinger He takes a
step to the bathroom then turns back

GUY
Listen I feel it behooves me to
ah offer to do this the old
fashioned way Given the extreme
state of your beauty and my totally
free afternoon

A moment as the absolute awkwardness of this offer sinks in
MAGGIE
Nono thank you Guy I just
think that would be too
complicated

GUY
No sweat just being polite

MAGGIE
Should I go out for a while

GUY
Nah just read something I’1l be
back in a jiff with the jizz

He marches to the bathroom

MAGGIE
Guy

GUY
Hm

( ) 24

MAGGIE
Why didn’t you end up becoming a
mathematician

GUY
I liked math because it was
beautiful that’s all I never
wanted to be a mathematician

MAGGIE
(encouraged)
Really You think math is
beautiful

GUY
I don’t think I know Anyone who
has touched even a hem of that
garment knows it’s beautiful For
me the hem was enough I couldn’t
have taken the frustration

MAGGIE
What do you mean

GUY
Of never seeing the whole thing Of
always just getting little glimpses
of the whole picture Spending my
whole life hunting for scraps of
truth

Embarrassed by his own candor Guy turns and shuts the door
to the bathroom leaving Maggie bemused and oddly charmed by
this unique character Hearing the water run in the bathroom
she turns some Ska music up high on the iPod as a sound
buffer She is so happy she does a solitary dance After a
few beats Guy appears with the plastic jar Maggie gave him
a little cloudy something at the bottom He watches her dance
for a moment We can see how much he likes her Seeing him
Maggie stops dancing embarrassed

MAGGIE
Wow Swift

She tries to take the jar but Guy swoops it away from her
and washes it off in the kitchen sink then swaddles it ina
tea towel like a newborn

GUY
Of course when there’s an actual
lady involved it’s a different
story I made you extrajust in
case you spill some

( ) 24

He hands her the bundle gently as if it were already a baby

MAGGIE
Thank you Guy This is really
great

GUY
Super

He just stands there Now what He fishes his phone out of
his pocket and turns the lens on himself Maggie and the
container which he gets her to hold up Maggie is
embarrassed and confused

I had to push it to Thursday
Georgette was having one of her
crises I couldn’t get her off the

What happened

JOHN
She got offers from two different
UK publishers for her new book and
she couldn’t decide

MAGGIE
Wow She doesn’t have anyone else
to talk to about something like
this except her ex-husband
Especially since her new book is
all about our affair and how it
ruined her life

JOHN
I’m sorry I messed up your day

MAGGIE
Not just my day Komiko -- my
student She’s a fragile person
and I had a meeting set up to
discuss her meeting with the toy
company But I had to cancel that
meeting because you had a meeting
And then you don’t even go to the
meeting with the publisher because
you were talking Georgette out of
her tree Why does nobody ever talk
me out of my tree

JOHN
(with affection)
Because you’re never up a tree

your way back down all by yourself

deserve any attention is that it
Like the squeaky wheel gets the
grease and the cactus never gets
watered

Attempting to defuse her John takes off one of Maggie’s

socks and

starts giving her a foot rub

You have to start thinking of
yourself as indispensable John

JOHN
(removing the other long
knee sock)
But I’m not I’m totally
dispensable On a practical level
youd be fine without me

MAGGIE
Do you realize that Paul faked the
ankle thing today just so you would
pick him up from school and then
you didn’t even show

JOHN
What do you mean

MAGGIE
He ran on it when I asked him to go
check on Justine He forgot

JOHN
That’s weird

No It’s not weird You want to
know why Because his mother is in
Reykjavik right now studying the
maternal techniques of the
Icelandic He needs his father’s
attention So do I

at the back of the room Hearing the text Maggie immediately
hides behind a book case and they both grab glasses of wine
peeking out to watch Georgette has not noticed them

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
And what I gleaned from this
exquisite torture are the thoughts
which this act of betrayal to me as
a woman provoked in me as an
anthropologist I must ask myself
is the contemporary obsession with
exclusive possession ruining our
chances of marital happiness

been a burden I appreciate it

You’re -- you’re welcome They’re
wonderful kids

GEORGETTE
We should get together some time I
feel I have been rather childish
about this I have to face the fact
that we are raising them
together the three of us

Georgette has an imperious seductiveness which is impossible
to resist

MAGGIE
Oh yes Yes I would love to

GEORGETTE
Call me some time It’s easy to get
my number

Maggie is left standing there besotted and shocked She
moves to the end of the signing line beside Felicia who has
bought a copy of “Bring Back the Geisha”

MAGGIE
You bought a book

FELICIA
I couldn’t resist

MAGGIE
Do we need to get it signed

FELICIA
I think we do

MAGGIE
Georgette is fascinating She’s
vulnerable and powerful and warm
and charming all at once Now I
get why he was so obsessed with
her

FELICIA
I don’t think ‘easy to live with’
is on that list though

MAGGIE
I like her I actually like her
I’m such a blockhead I always
thought I was rescuing John from
this monstrous egomaniac so he
could finally write his book and
that I knew better how to run his
life -- I was going to fix
everything

But he’s totally self-absorbed
while I do every single practical
thing and make the money And on
top of that I if it weren’t for
Lily Id say I’d made a terrible
mistake

FELICIA
(joking--with a glance at
Georgette signing books)
Too bad you can’t just give him

INT QUEENS QUAKER MEETING HOUSE - DAY

So now it suits the captors for the
little prisoners to be moved

PAUL
Aren’t you excited to see Mama

JUSTINE
Of course I’m excited to see Mama
I’m just sick of never knowing
which house any of my stuff is in
I can’t wait to be a grown up so I
can have kids and push them around

Maggie not hearing this stands on the street scrutinizing
the parking sign Paul and Justine watch her speaking
Danish their secret language

JUSTINE (CONTD)

(in Danish w subtitles)
Sometimes I wonder if she is a
little dim-witted What is she
doing

PAUL

She’s nice

JUSTINE
(in Danish)
You’re like a dog You love whoever
feeds you

PAUL
(in Danish)

loafers Justine is very tender with her mother Another
person

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
(to the kids)
I made you a nice snack and you are
allowed to watch one single episode
of something ghastly while eating
it But no fighting about what it
is Paul Justine gets to choose

GEORGETTE (CONT’D)
The snacks are already in the den

They run up the stairs Georgette turns to Maggie who is
standing in her socks Her demeanor is chillier than it was
at the book store

tea

MAGGIE
Coffee would be great Thank you

INT GEORGETTE’S LIVINGROOM - DAY

While Georgette blends the butter next door Maggie walks
through the room drawn to a beautiful black and white image

Georgette coming up behind her

GEORGETTE
That’s a lovely photo don’t you
think

MAGGIE

(startled by her)
Yes Thanks

She sips the buttered coffee --ack Georgette sips hers while
maintaining eye contact with Maggie A sort of “OK Corral”
moment

MAGGIE (CONT ’D)
It’s good to finally meet you

GEORGETTE

I won’t pretend it doesn’t cost me
something

( )

MAGGIE
Of course

GEORGETTE
I’m not into fakery

MAGGIE
Me neither

GEORGETTE
I detest the role of the spurned
wife I won’t play it--

MAGGIE
You’re not

GEORGETTE
Am I not

MAGGIE
You still -- have such a deep
connection to John

Georgette invites Maggie to sit down
GEORGETTE
We have managed to remain friends

it’s true

Georgette is looking at Maggie with surprise and a little
suspicion

MAGGIE

I mean your phone calls
GEORGETTE

Do you disapprove of them
MAGGIE

No--
GEORGETTE

The marriage has dissolved but we
are still parenting together

MAGGIE
Well I mean it’s more than just
parenting you guys are on the
phone several times a day Don’t
get me wrong I think it’s great
SoI

( )

Georgette is looking at her carefully Maggie’s cheeks are
going hot her heart is speeding up

GEORGETTE
Yes

MAGGIE
Well it’s obvious you’re still in
love with him

A moment of silence of disbelief

GEORGETTE
What the hell are you playing at

Maggie decides to jump off the cliff

MAGGIE
John and I are in trouble And I
don’t think he realizes how badly
in trouble we are Or he doesn’t
want to know And then when I saw
you at the readingI realized--
that there might be an opportunity

an opening somehowto get the
two of you back together
GEORGETTE

I see I see
Maggie nods hopefully

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
So you’re tired of your little
affair You are all done with it
And now you want to make sure you
don’t feel guilty so you’re going
to manipulate us all into some
absurd happy ending

Georgette stands looking down at Maggie who is shrinking by
the second

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
I have met a lot of control freaks
in my life in fact I even thought
I was one -- but you make me look
like an amateur

MAGGIE
I didn’t mean to insult you

( )

GEORGETTE
Have the decency to leave him and
face the fact that you poisoned my
life and my children’s lives and
probably John’s life with your own
selfishness That’s your burden
You earned it

MAGGIE
Excuse me Wait a minute If you
had such a perfect marriage why was
John miserable You neglected him
You used him You didn’t respect
his talent

GEORGETTE
If I am so awful what the hell are
you doing here trying to get him
back together with me

MAGGIE
I just think that actually even
though I do think you were pretty
self-absorbed and extremely needy
he needs it -- it actually kept
John in balance Taking care of
you made him think about someone
other than himself

GEORGETTE

disgruntled

TONY
Life doesn’t work that way you
dufus You can’t stuff what’s
already happened back in the box
God I really think you need help

MAGGIE
Why are you being so hostile

TONY
Because this pisses me off The
whole thing pisses me off

MAGGIE
Why

TONY
Why can’t you just leave your
husband like any normal human
being

MAGGIE
Because it would be such a waste

TONY

She stands up and starts putting on her coat as Tony tidies
up the living room muttering to himself She is on her way
to the door when she stops filled up with emotion She
cries suddenly hard and sits down helplessly Tony notices
and kneels beside her

TONY (CONT’D)
Hey Maggie Hey I’m sorry

Maggie sits sobbing

TONY (CONTD)
(gently)
What about Lily huh Fathers are a
good thing too

He wipes away a tear from her cheek

MAGGIE

(through her tears)
I know that I know that But
I’m just as afraid of her growing
up inside a dead marriage as
growing up without her dad in the
same house Kids can tell when
people are pretending

TONY

I don’t know Maggie It’s a tough
one

Sixty percent of children have

helping them see what’s inside

They can draw on the organs

down on the bed again crushed by guilt barely able to get
the words out

JOHN

You know we were snowed in
MAGGIE

I know
JOHN

So Georgette and I were thrown
together for two whole days And
there was this atmosphere of --
I don’t know it was very strange
I found myself unearthing
things old stuff

Good stuff or bad stuff

I don’t know Emotional Nostalgic -
The same stuff

MAGGIE
The same as what

JOHN
Georgette and I slept together

A long pause This victory hurts

John sits his head drooping Maggie begins to cry Even if
this was her idea it hurts

MAGGIE
Georgette was right

JOHN
What do you mean

MAGGIE
We should’ve just been an affair
You were having a rough spot in
your marriage and I came along
and

JOHN
But then we wouldn’t have had Lily

MAGGIE
That’s right

JOHN
(genuinely torn)
It was real between us all real
When I met you I was lost I was a
fucking mess I was so insecure and
youyou saved me You rescued me
I’m sorry I don’t know what to

do
MAGGIE
You know what to do

FELICIA
I know I think it’s better to be
honest When you can

JOHN
I’m just so surprised

FELICIA

A fumbling at the lock Singing It’s Tony in a rumpled
suit Three sheets to the wind

TONY

Tony looks at Felicia She glares at him to keep silent

JOHN
So you won your case
TONY
We trounced them
JOHN
What was it about
TONY
Tainted pudding
JOHN
A lawsuit
TONY

What else Lawsuits keep my wife in
post-modern choreography and me in
self-loathing A good deal all
round

FELICIA
If you’re going to be in that kind
of mood you should just go to bed

Tony is fumbling around in a kitchen cabinet
TONY
I’m craving one little nip of that

vanilla whiskey you so lovingly
gave me for Christmas Fi

drink away)
I’m not really much of a drinker

FELICIA
No You’re not

MAGGIE
John

JOHN
Was it a test

MAGGIE

JOHN

To see if I really was in love with
Georgette as you apparently
suspected

A pause Maggie feels a little frightened

JOHN (CONT’D)
You happy now

MAGGIE
Happy isn’t the right word

JOHN
I don’t even know what to say I’m
speechless

MAGGIE

We were going to break up I had a
feeling you were still in love with
Georgette And you were as it
turns out

JOHN
What about Lily My daughter Where
does she fit into this plan of
yours

MAGGIE
If we’re going to break up it’s --
better to do it soon for her sake
So that’s all she remembers

( )

92 92

John flips

JOHN
But I didn’t want to break up
Because among other things I was
committed to you and we had a child
together

MAGGIE
Not because you wanted to be with
me

JOHN
(on a wave of his own
thoughts--packing all the

while)
So this is the fate you’ve picked
out for me -- to just ricochet

around the tri-state area ruining
one family after another I don’t
accept that I didn’t choose this
I can’t believe I let you make me
feel so -- so guilty about
betraying you and wrecking our
marriage when you masterminded
this whole thing manipulated me
into falling for my ex-wife
colluded with her to get me invited
to that conference to make me into
some absurd patsy a pawn in your
revolting little narrative Well
guess what Your puppet is cutting
his strings You can both fuck
yourselves

MAGGIE
You and Georgette never really
stopped being together the whole
time we were married

JOHN
What

MAGGIE
I mean you thought it was over
but it never really was This is
the proof isn’t it It’s what you
wanted Be honest

JOHN
I think the question really is what
do you want What do you want
Maggie Hardin

MAGGIE
I want to live honestly
JOHN
Well you’re not off to a very good
start
MAGGIE

I don’t want a marriage that’s a
lie I don’t want to tiptoe around
our disconnection anymore You
deserve to be with someone who

really -- gives herself over to
you I did what I thought was
right

JOHN

Youre very ethical

MAGGIE
Youre the one who slept with
someone else

JOHN
(laughing in spite of
himself )
Are you fucking kidding me

John zips up his bag

By the way just out of curiosity --
did you ever love me

GEORGETTE
Youre a funny person There is
something very pure about you

so -- unconscious Yet I can’t
help it I like you I don’t blame

I’1l never get involved with anyone
else’s fate again -- not even my

own I’ll become a completely
passive non-interventional --
Buddhist I just feel like you guys
were so close to--

GEORGETTE
You have to let this go Maggie
This story has its own momentum
apart from you It always did

MAGGIE
I’m so sorry I thought I was going
to do something really grand like
a coup I’m so sick of being me

GEORGETTE
You should really try the tapping

MAGGIE
What tapping

GEORGETTE
I went to a workshop on
biofeedback It’s amazing What you
do is you figure out the essential
thing you want to change and you
make a sort of dictum Like for
you “I am not controlling” maybe
Or whatever you want to change

( ) 103

MAGGIE
‘T am not controlling’ is good

GEORGETTE
And you tap like this--

Georgette taps herself on the top of the head between the
eyebrows under her nose on her chin her temple behind the
ear and on the wrist and Maggie imitates her repeating
after her emotion building in her still and brimming over as
she taps

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
I am not controlling (tap tap tap)

She takes a plastic baggie filled with ashes from her purse
and puts it in front of him

JOHN
Where shall I scatter these

GEORGETTE
Anywhere is fine

JOHN
I can’t believe you burned my
fucking book on top of everything
else

GEORGETTE
I burned a copy of your book

JOHN
You probably didn’t even read it

GEORGETTE
Of course I read it That’s why I
burned it You cannibalized our
marriage to write that story

JOHN
You didn’t even bother to
fictionalize us in yours

GEORGETTE
I don’t write fiction

JOHN

You think you painted a precise
portrait of us in “Bring Back the
Geisha” I can’t believe you’re
making me feel bad about the sins
of my unpublished novel -- are we
just going to gloss over your
actual lies and manipulation

GEORGETTE
I’m not a liar You know I never
lie I lied now I manipulated
I debased myself morally --
because I loved you so terribly
much Maybe you could be flattered

This reaches him a little He knows what it costs her

( )

105 105

JOHN
If you love me so much why not
just -- tell me

GEORGETTE
You were married

JOHN
Oh Georgette

GEORGETTE
So you won’t take any
responsibility for the state of
your life You’re just a victim of
our plot

JOHN
I’m not a victim I’m just a man
who has fucked his life up and is
now trying to find an airbnb to
live in

GEORGETTE
There is nothing more to say in
that case

She starts putting on her coat he makes ready to go It’s
over Then she stops She’s making one more tactical
military maneuver to conquer him

GEORGETTE (CONTD)
The reason your novel doesn’t work
is You put too much weight on the
allegory You’re trying to use
fiction to prove a thesis The text
is crying out for passages of pure
economic theory Narrative blended
with theory is your specialty Make
it into a John Harding book and it
could be a phenomenon

JOHN
You really think so

GEORGETTE
I know it John You just have to
accept it’1ll probably be published
by Yale University Press not
Scribners Mark my words youll
be shortlisted for a Bateson Prize
You might even get one

He stares at her

Fuck You did it again

conditions whenever possible in

escorts Lily to a clutch of little girls on skates

Happy Birthday Lily

This is Lily’s third birthday party It’s a skating party
The skating instructor calls out cheerful commands We follow
John as he skates over to Georgette who is holding onto the
railing for dear life She loses her balance John catches
her

JOHN
Winter sports aren’t really your
strong suit

GEORGETTE
It’s not fair On skates I’m not
able to defend myself

JOHN
I’m keeping you on ice for the rest
of your life in that case

He pushes her on the ice as she screams in fear and joy In

the stands Tony Felicia and Max watch this tender scene

Tony is lacing up Max’s skates Maggie skates up to them and
leans on the barrier

Youll never know if it was you or

MAGGIE
I’ve decided to embrace the mystery
of the universe and stop bossing
everyone around so much

MAX
Good luck with that bossy pants

Max walks off toward the ice Maggie stares after him

MAGGIE
He’s been listening to us this
whole time

Max is already walking to the skating rink

TONY
One day he’s going to write a book
about us all And we are not going
to look good

Max skates off--he’s a demon skater Felicia watches Lily
skate by in the gaggle of little girls

I’m not sure

Something is dawning on Felicia and then it dawns on Tony
But Maggie is skating away already

Maggie backs up on the ice alone happy Stay with her a
moment She’s a good skater

Then she sees walking over the crest of a hill making his
way toward the rink skates slung over his broad shoulders
is Guy The pickle entrepreneur Who skates every Sunday
Glowing with idiosyncratic appeal Backing up Maggie stares
at him in surprise then thoughtfulness then affection She
