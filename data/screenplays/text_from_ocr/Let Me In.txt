BLACK SCREEN
We HEAR the DREADFUL MOANING and HOWLING of ARCTIC WIND
FADE IN very slowly TO DISCOVER we are HIGH ABOVE

A SNOWY RURAL LANDSCAPE - NIGHT

An empty TWO-LANE HIGHWAY snakes through massive pines
MOUNTAINS loom in the distance A BLIZZARD rages all around

HOLD

HAZY GLOWS of FLASHING RED and BLUE LIGHT suddenly appear
way down the highway It’s a SMALL MOTORCADE We make out
two POLICE CRUISERS an AMBULANCE The wind is so fierce we
can’t even hear the sirens yet

Through the swirling VEIL OF SNOW the image looks surreal
it could almost be a painting or a dream

SMASH CUT TO
THE MOTORCADE
SIRENS BLARING as they race through the blizzard
INT AMBULANCE
THROUGH THE AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD

We SEE the HEAVY SNOW HURTLING toward us obscuring the road
ahead The STROBES from the roof periodically FLASH and the
SNOWFLAKES suddenly appear to FREEZE in mid-air for a
blinding instant It is completely disorienting We HOLD on
this as we HEAR TWO PARAMEDICS in the front seats (0S)

PARAMEDIC ONE (0S)
Jesus I can’t see -- I can’t see a
fucking thing --

PARAMEDIC TWO (0S)
(into radio)
One three one to dispatch come in

IN THE BACK - QUICK TIGHT SHOTS

THREE MORE PARAMEDICS wearing long RUBBER GLOVES work
feverishly on a completely naked PATIENT whose face is
obscured from our view The Unseen Patient THRASHES
VIOLENTLY as they work in complete agony --

UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV - HANDHELD

Twisting and turning looking straight up at the Paramedics
as they struggle fiercely to hold him down --

PARAMEDIC THREE
Hold him down Get his arms Get
his arms
The Unseen Patient GASPS and GAGS --
PARAMEDIC THREE
I need an irrigation lens and a

1000cc’s of saline --

PARAMEDIC FOUR

Got it
As he reaches for the Patient’s eyes -- right at CAMERA --
the GASPING ACCELERATES -- AND -- THE PATIENT’S WRIST swings
up into FRAME in panic -- it snaps short suddenly with a

CLANG It is HANDCUFFED TO THE GURNEY

UP FRONT
The RADIO CRACKLES to life as we watch the strobing blizzard

RADIO (VO)
Go ahead one three one

PARAMEDIC TWO (0S)
This is one three one We have a
male mid-fifties with burns over
nine to nine and a half percent of
his body Prior to our arrival on
scene patient apparently doused
his head neck and face with some
sort of highly concentrated acid
Patient’s airway is severely
compromised due to fume inhalation
Vital signs unstable Please
advise Patient is a criminal
suspect We’re coming in with a
police escort right now

IN BACK
The Paramedics wrestle with the Unseen Patient --

PARAMEDIC FOUR
OK -- it’s in The lens is in
PARAMEDIC THREE
Irrigate

UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV -- HANDHELD

MORE EXCRUCIATING GASPING and CHOKING sounds as our view
FLOODS with SALINE -- the IMAGE LITERALLY RIPPLES -- and WE --

CUT TO
A MOVING SHOT DOWN A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
We’re FOLLOWING ON THE BACK of a PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN as he
makes his way towards a HOSPITAL ROOM DOORWAY As he
arrives a PRIEST is on his way out The Policeman stops
allowing the Priest to pass The Priest nods to him gravely
We FOLLOW the PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN INTO
THE DARK HOSPITAL ROOM
where a HEAVYSET NURSE attends to a bed on the other side of

the room her body blocking our view of the Patient’s face
She turns hearing the Policeman approaches HUSHED TONES

POLICEMAN
Can I talk to him

NURSE
He can’t actually talk

The Policeman LOOKS OFF SCREEN past her sees the Unseen
Patient for the first time whatever he sees it knocks the
wind out of him He nods utters under his breath shaken

POLICEMAN
I see Jesus
(then)
Alright well can I just
have a few minutes

The Nurse nods and leaves the room The Policeman moves
toward the UNSEEN PATIENTS BED slowly apprehensive --

FROM THE UNSEEN PATIENT’S POV

We finally get a CLOSE LOOK at the Policemans face as he
steps up He’s mid-40s with soulful but determined eyes A
small town sense about him From his haunted expression you
get the feeling he’s never seen anything quite like this
MACHINE NOISE surrounds us A RESPIRATOR HISSES ominously

The Policeman unzips his jacket takes a POLICE NOTEBOOK out
opens it places it in front of the Unseen Patient

he takes out a PEN carefully places the Patient’s FINGERS
around it Then he looks up RIGHT INTO CAMERA struggling a
bit

POLICEMAN
We uh We wanna know who you are

Beat His eyes drift down to THE PATIENT’S HAND gripping
the pen There is a fresh ACID SCAR across the top of it
The hand remains perfectly still no intention of writing

POLICEMAN (CONTD)

We’ll find out you know Sooner or
later You could save us some
legwork by communicating with us now

(beat)
I just got off the phone with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Guess there’s an idea you been
involved in a whole lot more than
just what’s been going on around
here Like maybe this all goes way
back Other states Other cities

(stares at him)
Is that true

(then)
Are you a Satanist You in some
kind of cult Coz if there are
others involved we’ll find them
too believe me

The PACE of the HEART MONITOR speeds up a bit The Policeman
turns noticing he turns back trying to gauge the reaction

POLICEMAN (CONTD)

What’s the matter Is that it Is
there someone you wanna tell me
about People you’re involved with

(beat then)
Look I’m gonna be honest with you
Your prognosis here it’s not too
good What you did it’s a real
shock to your system There may not
be a lotta time left So maybe
Maybe you got some things here you
wanna tell me Things that are
weighing heavy On your heart
Maybe you could write ‘em down for
me Clear your conscience

The Nurse appears again in the doorway
NURSE
I’m sorry The Nurse at reception
downstairs is on the phone She wants
to talk to you Says it’s urgent

The Policeman turns to her nods then turns back stares
INTO CAMERA cautious searching wondering if maybe he is on
the verge of something here

POLICEMAN
I’‘1ll be right back Okay

He turns to go and we CUT FOR THE FIRST TIME TO REVEAL

THE PATIENT

Under bandages is a viciously acid-ravaged face -- almost
unrecognizable as human anymore Haunted eyes stare out from

mangled flesh gazing after the Policeman with a sense of
fear After a beat he looks down in front of him at

THE POLICE NOTEBOOK

where his hand rests holding the pen motionless We HOLD
FOR A VERY LONG BEAT Finally fingers trembling he lifts
the pen begins to WRITE

INT NURSES STATION - MOMENTS LATER

The Policeman is on the phone BEHIND HIM RONALD REAGAN
silently gives a speech on TV -- the sound is off

POLICEMAN
His daughter When was this -- is
she still here

Suddenly a BEEPING ALARM sounds from behind the station --
the heavyset Nurse checks the bank of patient monitors -- she
quickly starts for the suspect’s hospital room -- the
Policeman notices growing concerned we SLOWLY PUSH IN

POLICEMAN
(into phone distracted
eyes following Nurse)
Well did she leave any information
a phone number

The response on the phone suddenly focuses him again --

POLICEMAN (CONTD)
(into phone)
What do you mean a little girl
How little
JUST THEN a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM erupts (0OS) from the
hospital room The Policeman drops the phone and rushes --

BACK INTO THE HOSPITAL ROOM

WIND SWIRLS The Nurse is standing next to the OPEN WINDOW
horrified her head in her hands THE HOSPITAL BED IS EMPTY

The Policeman moves over to LOOK OUT THE WINDOW THE
PATIENT’S DEAD BODY LIES TWISTED STCKLY ON THE SNOW-COVERED
GROUND TEN FLOORS BELOW

POLICEMAN
(utters breathless)
Jesus Mary and Joseph

IN THE EMPTY BED
The POLICE NOTEBOOK lies open it’s pages fluttering gently

in the wind On top written in the dead Patient’s TORTURED
SCRAWL are the words “Abby I’m sorry” HOLD then --

TIMECUT TO
A WIDE TABLEAU SHOT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

We are INSIDE THE LOBBY LOOKING OUT through massive GLASS
WINDOWS POLICE CARS and FORENSIC TEAMS have gathered
CRIMSON SNOW drifts serenely over everything ILLUMINATED by
the SPINNING RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS on the vehicles A SMALL
CROWD -- the Policeman included -- watches as the Patient’s
body is zipped into a body bag

In the FOREGROUND over this we see AN OUT OF FOCUS IMAGE OF

RONALD REAGAN continuing his speech -- it’s a REFLECTION from
the LOBBY TV on the window in front of the body Down here
the sound is on -- it’s the “Evil Empire” speech

RONALD REAGAN ON TV
There is sin and evil in the world
and we’re enjoined by scripture and
the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all
our might Our nation too has a
legacy of evil with which it must
deal The glory of this land has
been its capacity for transcending
the moral evils of our past

The Policeman lifts his hand -- there’s something in it it’s
the POLICE NOTEBOOK he stares at it haunted

SUPER TITLE “JEFFERSON COUNTY COLORADO MARCH 1983”
A NURSE steps up behind the Policeman starts to say
something and just as he turns we

CUT TO BLACK THE SOUND WASHES AWAY INTO SILENCE

After a long beat we start to HEAR a CHILD’S VOICE QUIETLY
SINGING there’s something mournful about it EERIE

CHILD’S SINGING
Eat some now save some for later
Eat some now save some for later

ANOTHER SUPER TITLE FADES UP “TWO MONTHS EARLIER”

A DISTANT TRAIN HORN CRIES as we SLOWLY FADE IN TO REVEAL
EXT APARTMENT COURTYARD

A TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY HIS BACK TO US SEATED ON A JUNGLE GYM

We’re PUSHING IN ON HIM as he sings to himself completely
hidden in a HOODED METALLIC SILVER WINTER JACKET BREATH
STEAMS around his head in the dim blue TWILIGHT SNOW
BLANKETS the ground underfoot No one else is around

As we CREEP CLOSER the Boy reaches into his pocket pulling
out candies unwrapping them and popping them into his
mouth one by one in a constant stream The rhythm of his
song is periodically interrupted by the need to chew

BOY
(singing absently hushed)
Now and Later the really tasty
treat Now and Later the
flavor can’t be beat

Suddenly a WOMANS VOICE ECHOES distantly

WOMAN’S VOICE
Owwwwen

The Boy keeps on singing
BOY
Look at all those

(chews then )
pieces Flavors that are wow

Beat

WOMAN’S VOICE
Owwwwen

We STOP in CLOSE UP on the BACK of the BOY’S HEAD -- and he
finally TURNS TO US in the direction of the Woman’s Voice
BOY
(annoyed mouth full)

What
This is OWEN

On the verge of thirteen his face still has a delicate pre-
adolescent androgyny He looks innocent almost fragile

WOMANS VOICE
Dinner time honey

As Owen gets up to go he pulls a fistful of candy wrappers
from his pocket dumps them on the ground buries them in the
snow with his foot CUT WIDE to SEE we are in

A MASSIVE 1960’S ERA APARTMENT COMPLEX - COURTYARD - TWILIGHT
The jungle gym sits in a meager playground at the center of
the deserted courtyard Tall buildings surround us As Owen
trudges away through the snow toward his building we CUT TO
INT OWEN’S APARTMENT

LONG LENS CLOSE ON OWEN - AT THE DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

Owen sits head bowed holding his MOTHER’s hand as she says
grace in the FG SOFT FOCUS HOLD on OWEN throughout

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
Bless us O Lord and these Thy gifts
for which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty in the name of Jesus
Christ our Lord Amen

As they release hands Owen’s mother’s ARM reaches over
pours Chablis into a WINE GLASS in the FG -- OWEN’S EYES
flit a bit anxiously to the glass as it FILLS

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
How was school today

Owen scrunches his face shrugs a shoulder She laughs

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
That good huh

(notices he’s not eating)
Hey what’s this -- you didn’t go
and spoil your dinner on me now

He guiltily stabs a forkful of his Kraft mac and cheese

OWEN
No What I didn’t

The PHONE RINGS She stands and we FLEETINGLY GLIMPSE for
the first time she wears a POWDER BLUE NIGHTGOWN and ROBE --

OWENS MOTHER (0S)

She musses his hair affectionately EXITS FRAME ANSWERS PHONE

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)

Owen turns watching her OFF-SCREEN with growing anxiety

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
Look Look I’m not -- I’m not

We’re eating dinner

Owens EYES discreetly FOLLOW as she reaches into FRAME grabs
her WINE then paces OS -- the PHONE CORD stretches TAUT

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)

She SIGHS re-enters FRAME holds out the phone

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
Your father wants to talk to you

OWEN
(into phone uncomfortable)
Hello Hi I’m okay

Owen steals a final look at the WINE GLASS as his mother sets
it down again in the FG RE-FILLS it
INT OWEN’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Owen gingerly sets his plate in the sink which is piled with
dirty dishes He peeks THROUGH THE DOORWAY INTO

THE DARKENED LIVING ROOM

Where his mother partially obscured by the door jam sits
with her wine glass watching ranting televangelist Dr Gene
Scott on TV We HEAR the sound of her CRYING

Owen turns away hopeless He is about to go when he SEES

A LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE

Lying on the counter His eyes linger on it

CUT TO
INT OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

A model of the SPACE SHUTTLE hangs from the ceiling There’s
a TELESCOPE by the window Posters of the planets STAR
WARS toys “Beth” by KISS plays softly from a cheap RADIO

OWEN’S BARE FEET stalk slowly though the chaotic clothes-
strewn mess on the floor We HEAR his BREATHING

CLOSE ON THE LARGE KITCHEN KNIFE
As it pierces the air creeping forward threateningly

OWEN (0OS)
(very quiet menacing)
Hey little girl

REVEAL Owen as he steps up to his dresser MIRROR He’s
stripped down to his underwear holding the knife and
wearing a PLASTIC SEMI-TRANSPARENT HALLOWEEN MASK which
completely obscures his expression It’s a disturbing image

OWEN
(staring down his “victim”)
Are you a little girl

Just then a WOMAN’S SHRIEK echoes distantly Owen turns as

LIGHT SPILLS onto his ceiling from outside his window There’s

a MAN’S VOICE too Owen sets down the knife moves to

HIS WINDOW

Across the courtyard framed in one of the other apartment
windows a COUPLE having just come home are ARGUING
passionately We can’t make out what they’re saying

They are LARRY and VIRGINIA early 30s

Owen watches them motionless He turns his telescope
towards them cautiously presses his eye to the eyepiece

THE TELESCOPE

FOCUSES on Virginia as she yells at Larry She’s hot-tempered
Has a somewhat trashy small town sexiness Larry tries to
calm her to no avail reaches for her wrist she pulls away
At their feet a tiny LAP DOG BARKS incessantly

Owen just stares from behind the mask Slowly BREATHING
Finally he turns the telescope starts to peep into other
windows He finds

A FORTY-ISH SHIRTLESS MAN (JACK)

lying on a BENCH in his cramped living room lifting weights
His CHEST is OVERLY DEVELOPED

Owen pulls his eye from the telescope pushes up his mask
He looks down at his own scrawny chest ashamed Then he
notices something the courtyard is QUIET again He looks
up Swings the telescope back toward

LARRY AND VIRGINIA’S APARTMENT

Virginia has calmed Larry contrite rubs her arm
apologetically He tries to kiss her but she turns away
He touches her face tries again grudgingly she lets him

Owen watches with morbid fascination as the KISS builds
turns SEXUAL as Virginia gives in Larry starts to grope
her reaches into her shirt exposing her breast WHEN --
VIRGINIA’S STARTLED EYES SUDDENLY MEET THE TELESCOPE --

OWEN backs away terrified -- ducks behind his curtain He
stands there frozen heart racing HOLD

Finally he PEEKS back Virginia is closing the drapes
Humiliated Owen starts to turn away when he SEES --

A SILHOUETTED U-HAUL MOVING TRUCK

RUMBLE into the driveway between buildings A FIGURE climbs
out disappears behind the truck

After a moment he re-emerges struggling with a VERY LARGE
OLD STEAMER TRUNK along the passenger side

He stops looks up into the cab panting his breath misting
up into the freezing air He waits Finally ANOTHER MUCH
SMALLER FIGURE emerges climbing down Owen LOOKS

THROUGH THE TELESCOPE

It is A TWELVE YEAR OLD GIRL Wrapped in a dark poncho she
has mysterious somewhat coarse features like a gypsy She
doesn’t even acknowledge the Figure waiting beside her She
just starts into the courtyard

The Figure -- a MAN IN HIS MID-FIFTIES with HEAVY BURDENED
EYES -- finally follows resignedly with the heavy trunk
looking almost like her servant Or maybe her FATHER

Owen watches as they make their way toward his building As
they get close he notices something through the telescope --
despite the snowy ground THE GIRL IS COMPLETELY BAREFOOT

Owen cranes to look straight down out his window as right
below him the pair disappear into the entrance to his building

CUT TO
INT OWEN’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR 12
A NARROW VIEW THROUGH OWEN’S PARTIALLY OPENED FRONT DOOR
We look out at a STAIRWELL at the end of the EMPTY HALL
Approaching FOOTSTEPS ECHO Just as the TOP of the GIRL’S
HEAD starts to appear climbing up the stairs --
OWEN quickly and quietly SHUTS his front door He waits
pressed against the front door as the MUFFLED FOOTSTEPS grow
LOUDER Finally he gets the courage to PEEK --
THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

As the Girl and The Father pass distorted and obscured by
the LENS’ FISHEYE EFFECT We HEAR OWEN BREATHING RAPIDLY

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 13

The DOOR SLOWLY OPENS a crack and OWEN peers cautiously out
to SEE THE FATHER setting down the luggage starting to open
the door to the apartment RIGHT NEXT DOOR

Owen stares down again at the Girl’s bare feet as she waits
her face turned away Finally she steps inside The Father
picks up the luggage steps in after her

INT OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT 14

Owen lies on his bed eating Now and Laters LISTENING to the
SOUNDS of his new neighbors coming through the wall There’s
a STRANGE EERIE GROANING a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING

We MOVE IN ON OWEN as he leans close to the wall trying to
make out the INTENSE SOUNDS with a building sense of dread
We’re CLOSE on HIS WIDE OPEN EYES when we hear a SUDDEN LOUD
BANG FROM THE WALL -- and we FLASHCUT TO A HAUNTING VISION

A MURKY BLUE FIELD -- VERY SHALLOW FOCUS

CRIMSON-COLORED CLOUDS BILLOW and GROW disturbingly -- it
looks like BLOOD POURING into DIM BLUE WATER

We HOLD -- THEN SEE THREE LIGHTENING FAST CUTS OF TIGHT SHOTS

LESH TEARS --
ICIOUS DEMONIC EYES STARE --
LOOD SPRAYS --

i

OWEN GASPS sits up with a START CUT WIDE to REVEAL we are
INT OWEN’S ROOM — MORNING 15

Owen sits in bed in exactly the spot we left him last night
having just awakened from a nightmare He starts to get his
bearings looks around him at the room in the morning light
Finally he stares at the wall Everything is quiet now

EXT APARTMENT COURTYARD - MORNING 16

Owen steps out of his building wearing his heavy jacket and a
BACKPACK He starts across the courtyard when he SPOTS A
BARE FOOTPRINT in the snow He turns back looks up in
the apartment next to his the WINDOWS have been COMPLETELY
BOARDED UP from the inside with NEWSPAPER AND CARDBOARD

Owen stares at the creepy sight when he HEARS CRUNCHING
FOOTSTEPS and a HIGH-PITCHED BARK -- he turns to see LARRY
and VIRGINIA from across the way out walking their tiny dog

As they approach Virginia sees Owen -- he smiles meekly
self-conscious Her expression hardens she gives hima
cold pregnant stare as she passes Owen stiffens averts
his eyes hoping she won’t say anything about last night

But just then Larry unaware affectionately and
unconsciously slides his hand down onto her ass Suddenly
embarrassed she swats it away angrily Larry looks at her
confused as they continue silently to their building

Owen relaxes relieved he finally starts out of the courtyard
-- but has to take a last lingering look at the boarded up
windows as he goes -- as he stares we start to hear

CHILDREN’S VOICES
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America
INT OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL HOMEROOM - MORNING
We’re MOVING PAST about 30 STUDENTS giving the pledge
STUDENTS (CONTD)
And to the Republic for which it
stands

FIND OWEN hand over his heart reciting with the others --

STUDENTS (CONTD)
One Nation under God

SPLAT A huge SPITBALL slaps onto Owen’s jacket He turns
to see one of the students smiling cruelly This is KENNY
Resigned Owen starts to scrape the mess off and we CUT TO
INT INDOOR MIDDLE SCHOOL POOL - MORNING

Pre-class chaos KIDS IN BATHING SUITS scream splash push
each other into the pool Still fully dressed Owen walks up
behind his Serbian PE teacher MR ZORIC says meekly

OWEN
Mr Zoric

Mr Zoric turns sees Owen is not in his bathing suit

MR ZORIC
Owen -- c’mon serious again
OWEN

I have a cold My mom wrote me a note
He holds out THE NOTE clearly in Owen’s own handwriting
misspellings and all it reads “PLEASE EXSCUSE OWEN FROM
SWIMING HE HAS A COLD”

Mr Zoric stares at Owen for a long beat takes pity on him

MR ZORIC
Okay Go sit in bleecher

Owen sits looks out at THE POOL a bit miserably SEEING

KENNY

who along with TWO COHORTS circles and accosts a GIRL WITH
VERY DEVELOPED BREASTS the boys keep disappearing under the
water grabbing at her She backs away shrieklaughing
uncomfortably when Kenny appears behind her and undoes the
strap on her bikini with a tug -- she grabs it before it can
fall SCREAMS for Mr Zoric at the top of her lungs -- Mr
Zoric turns sees Kenny laughing hysterically --

MR ZORIC
Okay Kenny Ten laps Now

KENNY
I didn’t do anything

MR ZORIC
Now Or I make it twenty

Kenny pounds the water with his fist and as Zoric turns
away the Girl SOCKS him INCREDIBLY HARD in the arm Owen
can’t help but smile -- but it’s unfortunate timing because
at just that moment Kenny feels Owen’s stare turns -- Owen
stops smiling abruptly averts his eyes wishing he were
invisible but sadly he’s not Kenny glares and we CUT TO

INT POOL LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

Owen spins the tumbler on his locker as fast as he can -- he
pops it open quickly grabs his backpack when he HEARS --

VOICE (0S)
Hey little girl

Owen turns to see Kenny and his friends (DONALD and MARK)
surrounding him still dripping in their suits Kenny is
twirling a wet towel into a whip -- he SNAPS it suddenly into
Owen’s face --

OWEN
(recoiling in pain)
Ow Dont

KENNY
Are you a little girl

He SNAPS it viciously again -- Owen bends over covering his
face trying to protect himself -- as Kenny moves in closer --

KENNY
That’s why he won’t go swimming --
he doesn’t want everyone to see what
a little fucking girl he is --

Desperate Owen tries to make a break for it -- but they grab
him wrestle him violently to the ground -- he starts to
scream but Kenny covers his mouth -- Owen GASPS for air --

OWEN’S POV - HANDHELD
As he flails in panic -- Kenny giggles sadistically --

KENNY
Hold him down Get his arms Get
his arms

As they do Kenny reaches under the waistband of Owen’s
pants seizes his UNDERWEAR YANKS it upwards slowly
STRETCHING it into a brutal WEDGIE --

Owen SQUIRMS FRANTICALLY for an excruciating moment until
suddenly a PUDDLE starts to GROW on the ground by his legs --

DONALD realizes repulsed -- backs off --
DONALD
Dude shit I think he pissed
himself
KENNY

(laughing out of control)
Oh Shit

DONALD
(wiping himself with his
towel horrified)
He fucking pissed himself

The three of them scramble up -- Mark checks to see if he is
soiled too -- he kicks Owen’s side in disgust --
MARK

Jesus Fucking freak
Owen just lies there as they head off -- Kennys
uncontrollable LAUGHTER ECHOES A few CLASSMATES stare down
at Owen askance changing at their lockers
Owen gets up slowly picks his backpack off the ground
CUT TO
OWEN’S HAND GRABBING FIVE PACKS OF NOW AND LATER CANDIES

from a huge candy display -- WE ARE

INT JEFFERSON COUNTY VIDEO ARCADE - LATE AFTERNOON 20

Owen waits in line at the pay counter The after school
crowd is here and the DIN from the games is DEAFENING

Owen looks over at a TENTH GRADE COUPLE making out by the MS
PAC-MAN machine their tongues deep in each other’s mouths
Owen stares when suddenly he BARELY HEARS the VOICE of the
SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD COUNTERMAN calling him over the cacophony

Embarrassed Owen places his candy and a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL

on the glass counter As the Counterman grabs the money

Owen NOTICES something in the COUNTER DISPLAY CASE below it --
an OPEN PEN KNIFE among some knickknacks HIS EYES FIX ON IT

EXT APARTMENT COURTYARD - TWILIGHT 21

Owen sits on the jungle gym with his new PEN KNIFE He unwraps
a candy STABS it with the knife puts it in his mouth --

OWEN
(singing mouth full)
Eat some now save some for later

A metal DOOR THUDS shut -- Owen quiets turns to see

THE NEW NEIGHBOR GIRL’S FATHER

having just exited his building Owen watches as The Father
sets down a DUFFLE vainly attempting to light a cigarette in

the wind with his BIC LIGHTER -- “FLIT--FLIT--FLIT” The
Father’s eyes drift up suddenly feeling Owen’s gaze --

The two STARE at each other for an eerie suspended moment

From this closer vantage point we can see for the first time
that The Father has a LARGE DARK BIRTHMARK under one eye --
there’s something striking about it

Owen attempts a smile but The Father just picks up the
duffle starts out toward the street -- we WATCH FROM

A VERY HIGH SHOT LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN OVER THE COURTYARD
Owen remains motionless on the jungle gym watching him go
HOLD

Then just as Owen finally starts to quietly resume singing --

OWEN
Eat some now save some for --

WE SMASH CUT TO

EXT WAL-MART PARKING LOT - LONG LENS SHOT - NIGHT 22

HOLD on the quiet mostly deserted lot bathed in sodium
vapor light AFTER A BEAT we SEE some BLURRY MOVEMENT in
the FG -- we HEAR the familiar “FLIT-FLIT-FLIT” of the BIC
LIGHTER again SMOKE rises INTO FRAME and we realize we are
now WATCHING from THE FATHER’S POV over his shoulder

A BEATEN-UP DATSUN B-210 pulls into the lot parks A BARELY
SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID gets out heads toward the store

HEAR a LONG EXHALE a STREAM OF SMOKE blows into FG view
CUT TO

THE DATSUN’S DRIVER DOOR 23

Seen from the shoulders down The Father’s GLOVED HANDS slide

a tow truck driver’s “SLIM JIM” down the car’s window and
into the door DIGGING until the DOOR LOCK POPS UP

CUT TO
INT DATSUN - MOMENTS LATER 24

Total STILLNESS QUIET We’re in back looking toward the
empty parking lot through the windshield

The SIXTEEN YEAR OLD approaches We HEAR the VERY FAINT
sound of BREATHING from somewhere in the car

HOLD as the Kid gets in starts the engine drives out

After a few moments we NOTICE something BLURRY moving very
subtly in the FG the Kid does not CUT AROUND TO

THE REVERSE ANGLE

past the Kid as he drives Right behind him just visible in
shadow is a FIGURE (The Father) in a primitive looking CLOTH
MASK with the eyes cut out The Figure WAITS motionless
poised for a very long disturbing beat We HEAR a
PASSING TRAIN getting CLOSER LOUDER

Then as the Kid brakes -- a TRAIN HORN BLARES -- and the
Figure LUNGES forward JAMS the gear shaft into park with one
gloved hand -- uses the other to MASH a SMALL CLOTH RAG over
the startled Kid’s nose and mouth It’s messy brutal --

CLOSE ON the FIGURE’S IMMOBILE MASKED HEAD as the KID FLAILS
MADLY (0S) The utter terror in the Kid’s muffled SCREAMS
is excruciating -- like the primal squeal of an animal
experiencing the sudden incomprehensible realization it is
being slaughtered It goes on way too long

Finally he QUIETS from behind the mask we hear HEAVY RAPID
BREATHING -- as the breathing starts to slow we CUT TO
HIGH ANGLE - OUTSIDE THE CAR - AT A TRAIN CROSSING
AN AMTRAK TRAIN finishes passing in front of the Datsun

stopped on a sleepy two lane road no other cars are around
The CROSSING GATES LIFT but the car doesn’t move CUT TO

EXT THE ABANDONED DATSUN - LATER

On a SECLUDED MOUNTAIN ROAD the driver door is ajar PAN
SLOWLY to a SNOWY HILLSIDE WOOD beside the road We HEAR
RUSTLING SOUNDS from within the TREES up the steep incline

IN THE WOOD

Partially OBSCURED BY TREES we SEE the SIXTEEN YEAR OLD KID
SUSPENDED BY HIS FEET on a ROPE SLUNG over a TREE BRANCH
Now in a CLEAR PLASTIC RAIN SLICKER still wearing his mask
The Father finishes hoisting the boy’s body pulling the rope
with all his strength grunting panting hard --

CLOSE ON the DUFFLE The Father reaches in pulls out a
FOLDING HUNTING KNIFE(looking a lot like a much scarier
version of Owen’s pen knife) a LARGE PLASTIC JUG and a
FUNNEL

CLOSE PROFILE ON the UP-SIDE-DOWN SILHOUETTED HEAD of the
BOY BREATH steams from his nostrils he is still alive but
heavily sedated The Father ENTERS FRAME crouched on his
knees moves in close to the Boy’s face He opens the knife
presses it delicately against the Boy’s neck -- then all at
once THRUSTS the knife upward PUNCTURING an artery We
watch in SILHOUETTE as BLOOD DRAINS in a THICK THROBBING
STREAM TIP DOWN to see it FILLING the PLASTIC JUG below

Nearby FOOTSTEPS CRUNCH in the snow -- startled The Father
turns to see A DEER watching him They stare at each other

TIMECUT TO
THE WOOD - MINUTES LATER
The Father is carefully re-packing his duffle He has
removed the mask his face is red sweaty his eyes have a

far away look He looks numb Bitter His soul eaten away

He reaches down picks up the plastic jug now filled with
blood

Walking back toward the duffle he gently pulls the funnel
out of the jug just starts to screw on a lid WHEN --HIS LEG
SINKS SHARPLY through the snow into a hole hidden below -- he
loses balance DROPS the JUG -- it goes TUMBLING DOWN the
HILLSIDE -- He scrambles up and runs lamely down the hill
after it he EMERGES ONTO --

THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN ROAD 29

near the Boy’s abandoned car The mostly EMPTY JUG sits on
its side in the street BLOOD POOLING around it The Father
stares at it devastated out of breath in pain AS --

DISTANT HEADLIGHTS

appear way down the road -- The Father turns to see A SNOW
PLOW approaching Panicked he hobbles over grabs the jug
and clambers back up the hill DISAPPEARING into the woods

OVER THIS we HEAR as HUSHED MENACING VOICE

VOICE (OWEN)
What’s the matter Are you scared

CUT TO
EXT APARTMENT COURTYARD - NIGHT 30

Owen stands holding his OPEN PEN KNIFE threateningly
staring at something OFF-SCREEN

OWEN
Are you scared little girl Huh

As he lunges forward with the knife we PAN with him to
reveal his “victim” -- A TREE He THRUSTS his knife into the
bark with all of his might Again And again Finally he
stops As he catches his breath he suddenly feels a chill
as if someone is there -- he turns to see

THE NEW NEIGHBOR GIRL standing on the jungle gym watching
him expressionless Up close her face looks tired a
bit malnourished Her hair looks like it hasn’t been
washed in a very long time Her clothes look old ill-
fitting like they could have come from the Good Will

GIRL
What are you doing

OWEN
(suddenly embarrassed)
Nothing
(then)
What are you doing

GIRL
Nothing

Beat Owen tries to make conversation
OWEN
You guys just moved in didn’t you
Upstairs

She looks at him

GIRL
How do you know

OWEN
I live next door
(points)
Right there

Pause Finally she nods Jumps down from the jungle gym

GIRL
Just so you know I can’t be your
friend

OWEN

--Why What do you mean

GIRL
Does there have to be a reason
That’s just the way it is

And she goes He watches her for a stunned beat Then

OWEN
Well who said I wanted to be your
friend

But she’s already gone into the building
31 INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE OWEN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 31

Owen sticks his key in the front door lock when he hears
FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairwell they have an ODD CADENCE
Owen turns as The Father appears LIMPING up the steps with
his duffle Their eyes meet briefly Then Owen opens his
door disappears inside

The Father continues towards us as he passes Owen’s door he
STOPS for a moment stares at it then moves on CUT TO

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR 32

Owen has his eye pressed to the peephole breathing through
his mouth trying to be very quiet He slowly backs away
LISTENING to The Father’s IRREGULAR FOOTSTEPS the door
next door CREAKS OPEN then THUDS SHUT

INT OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT 33

Owen is taking off his jacket when he starts to hear
MUFFLED INDECIPHERABLE YELLING coming through the wall from
the neighbors’ apartment He jumps slightly as he hears a
SUDDEN STIFLED CRASH and a THUD The YELLING CONTINUES

Concerned Owen moves apprehensively toward the wall PRESSES
HIS EAR TO IT The yelling becomes a bit more intelligible
-- but it is not clear whose voice it is -- there’s something
unsettling almost FEROCIOUSLY INHUMAN about it -- maybe it’s
just acoustics or the way it distorts through Owen’s wall

VOICE (THROUGH WALL)
(near-hyperventilation)
--SUPPOSED TO DO AM I SUPPOSED
TO GO OUT AND DO IT MYSELF HUH
(long pause then )
SAY SOMETHING

Owen listens on pins and needles as the argument goes
SILENT for a LONG MOMENT we can just barely make out
someone HYPERVENTILATING

HOLD
Then finally we CUT TO
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL 34

We are CLOSE on The Father who sits at a table looking
down quietly despondent all of the gear from his duffle --
including the empty blood-stained jug -- is scattered across
the floor behind him like it has been hurled there We are
shooting PAST THE ARM of an OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE (could it be
the GIRL) standing in FOREGROUND -- the Figure is
HYPERVENTILATING waiting for a response

The Father glances up at the Figure then looks down again
bitterly ashamed Finally almost inaudibly he says

THE FATHER
-Maybe I’m getting sloppy Maybe
I want to get caught Maybe I’m
just tired of this

His eyes drift back up Exasperated the Figure STORMS OFF
WIPING THROUGH FRAME We CUT BACK TO

INT OWEN’S ROOM 35

his ear still against the wall anxiously waiting for more
But nothing more comes As he edges away from the wall we --

CUT TO
A MOVING SHOT DOWN A CROWDED MIDDLE SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING 36

We’re WITH OWEN as he passes through THRONGS of ARRIVING
STUDENTS -- there’s a HUSHED EXCITEMENT coursing through the
crowd something is going on Up ahead Owen sees kids
gathering in CLUSTERS outside the ADMINISTRATION OFFICE
whispering to each other spying into the windows --

As Owen reaches them he PEERS with the others INTO THE
OFFICE WINDOWS in the waiting area are several UNIFORMED
POLICE OFFICERS Their expressions are grave One talks to
a woman who looks like she could be the PRINCIPAL Behind
the counter SECRETARIES are crying

A MAN’S VOICE interrupts from behind the kids

MANS VOICE
‘Scuse me fellas -- can I get
through here

Owen turns -- IT’S THE SMALL TOWN PLAINCLOTHES COP FROM THE
OPENING OF THE FILM The group parts to let him into the
office -- as he passes we HEAR

POLICEMAN (VO)
As some of you may have heard
there was an incident last night
and one of your recent graduates
here was killed

Owen watches as our POLICEMAN steps up to the Principal -- the
other Cop turns introduces them he shakes her hand CUT TO

INT MIDDLE SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - MORNING 37
The ENTIRE STUDENT BODY listens to the PLAINCLOTHES POLICEMAN

as he speaks at a podium The PRINCIPAL stands behind him
with the other UNIFORMED COPS and VARIOUS FACULTY on stage

POLICEMAN (CONTD)
I know many of you knew Scottie Your
teachers tell me he was a bright funny
student and a real group leader who
many of you knew from his continuing
involvement with the Young Life
Christian association

ON OWEN in the crowd his backpack cradled in his lap

POLICEMAN (CONTD)
I want to assure you that we’re doing
everything possible to find those
responsible for this tragedy but in the
mean time we need you all to be on the
lookout for any suspicious activity

Owen HEARS a STRANGLED LAUGH -- he peeks behind him to see
KENNY MARK and DONALD a couple rows back they’re quietly
joking around unmoved by the proceedings Donald suddenly

glances in Owen’s direction -- Owen quickly turns away SLINKS

DOWN in his seat hiding from their view --

POLICEMAN (CONTD)
Your safety is our number one concern

INT OWEN’S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Owen sits on the floor by the newspaper opening a NOTEBOOK
packed with clippings scraps of paper We HEAR OWEN’S
MOM’S MUFFLED VOICE from the other room she’s very upset

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)

Owen ignores her turning the pages of his notebook INSIDE

MURDERS ASSASSINATIONS SERIAL KILLINGS

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
And I don’t want you going outside
the complex when you get home

In the book Owen’s eyes linger on his own CRUDE SKETCHES of
WEAPONS KNIVES GUNS -- and a few CHILD-LIKE DRAWINGS OF
BLOODY SEVERED HEADS with names scrawled underneath
“KENNY” “MARK” “DONALD” he smiles

OWEN’S MOTHER (0OS)
Owen

Finally Owen finds an empty page -- he slips the new article
into it closes the book satisfied He gets up goes to his

desk is about to put the notebook in an open drawer when he
glances OUT THE WINDOW AT

THE COURTYARD
He stares at the EMPTY JUNGLE GYM for a beat WHEN SUDDENLY --
Owen’s Mother’s voice grows LOUDER like she’s approaching --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
I want you to promise me honey --

We HEAR the sound of her trying to open Owen’s locked door --

OWENS MOTHER (0S)
Hey what’s --
(KNOCKS on door HARD)

Owen quickly buries the notebook deep in the drawer grabs
the cut up newspaper on the floor hides it under his bed --

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
Well did you hear me --

OWEN

She starts to CRY Owen immediately feels bad He moves to
her slowly hugs her We CONTINUE TO STAY ONLY ON HIM as
he speaks softly trying to comfort her as she begins to SOB

OWEN
It’s okay Mom Don’t worry
(then even quieter )
I‘1l just stay in the courtyard

OWEN’S MOTHER (0S)
(squeezing him emotional)
Okay sweetie Thank you

40 EXT APARTMENT COURTYARD - TWILIGHT

Owen exits his building Across the way he SEES JACK (the
weight-lifter we saw through the telescope earlier) he wears
an INSULATED RUNNERS OUTFIT stretching his legs against the
wall He looks over at Owen nods hello JOGS OFF

Owen starts for the jungle gym he looks up at the BOARDED UP
WINDOWS of the apartment next to his no signs of life

41 JUNGLE GYM - LATER
Owen sits by himself playing with a RUBIK’S CUBE struggling
with it After a long beat A FIGURE comes up quietly behind
him sits on the jungle gym It’s the GIRL Owen can tell
she’s there but doesn’t turn Finally she speaks

GIRL
Oh it’s you again huh

Owen doesn’t respond pretending to be occupied by the Cube

GIRL
You know I really wanna be left
alone

OWEN
Me too

GIRL

So leave

Owen doesn’t turn but decides to take a stand fires back

OWEN
You leave
(then a bit weaker)
I’ve lived here way longer than

Beat She just accepts that Sits there She looks at the
Rubik’s Cube tremendously curious despite herself

GIRL

She nods defensive He looks at her like it’s so obvious

OWEN
It’s a Rubik’s Cube

Finally she takes it Gets to work Beat Owen notices

OWEN
-You smell kinda funny

And she looks quite ill So pale Frail She glances up
self-conscious returns to the puzzle Owen sees her clothes
are thin worn out like a street urchin’s

OWEN
Aren’t you cold
GIRL
(eyes on the puzzle)
No
OWEN
Why not
GIRL

I dunno I don’t really get cold

Beat He watches her so absorbed in the Cube After a
while he gets up Waits for her to look up she doesn’t
So he starts to walk away watching her tentative

OWEN
-See you tomorrow then

And as Owen heads off WE STAY WITH THE GIRL totally focused
on the puzzle The door to the building CREAKS open and
SLAMS shut and she looks up turns to see Owen is gone

Just then we HEAR an INHUMAN GROWL and GURGLE The Girl
doubles over in excruciating pain We HOLD on her as she
struggles BREATHING SLOWLY Finally she looks up
glancing around the courtyard warily She gets to her feet
weary stumbles toward the street

EXT BRIDGE UNDERPASS NEAR ENTRANCE TO THE COMPLEX - NIGHT

A FIGURE JOGS towards us slowing as he approaches the
underpass It’s JACK out of breath on his way back to the
complex As he enters the dark underpass he hears a quiet
FRAGILE VOICE -- it’s EERIE

FRAGILE VOICE
Help me

It startles him he looks around but it’s dark under here

JACK
-Hello

FRAGILE VOICE
Please Help me

Finally just barely he SEES something against the wall ina
dark heap -- it’s the little Girl She looks terrible

JACK
Hey there Are you okay What

GIRL
I fell down
JACK

JACK

We WATCH the two of them their FIGURES in SILHOUETTE she
reaches out her TREMBLING ARMS tries to grab on to him --

GIRL

JACK
(lifting her gingerly)
You got it

GIRL
(struggling to hold on)
-eyeah
JACK
(feels her slipping)
You got it --
THEN -- ALL AT ONCE -- THE GIRL’S BODY CONVULSES VIOLENTLY

AROUND JACK WITH INCREDIBLE SPEED AND STRENGTH SHE BITES
VICIOUSLY INTO HIS NECK EASILY OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN THOUGH
HE’S THREE TIMES HER SIZE -- HE SCREAMS STAGGERING TERRIBLY
IN UTTER SHOCK AND HORROR --

JACK
JESUS CHRIST JESUS CHRIST

And he COLLAPSES the Girl on him like a vice HOLD as she
takes a LONG THIRSTY DRINK from JACK’S MOTIONLESS BODY

Finally she lifts her head BLOOD STREAMS DOWN HER FACE
She looks haunted disturbed Then in one swift move she
reaches down and TWISTS HIS HEAD SHARPLY SNAPPING HIS NECK

She gets up looks around to see if anyone has seen No one
is around And she runs off her body again moving just like
a little girl’s -- seeming frightened vulnerable fragile

CUT TO
INT OWEN’S ROOM

We’re LOOKING THROUGH OWEN’S TELESCOPE PANNING THROUGH the
empty living room lights still on The TELESCOPE SWINGS
OVER and REFOCUSES on ANOTHER WINDOW where LARRY AND VIRGINIA
sit in the dark in their pajamas watching DYNASTY on TV
Larry has a hand on Virginia’s BARE THIGH The TELESCOPE

HOLDS in anticipation of any exciting developments -- WHEN --
we start to HEAR MUFFLED ARGUING -- REVEAL
OWEN

He takes his eye away from the telescope and turns toward
his BEDROOM WALL The new neighbors are fighting again He
moves closer climbing onto his bed to listen concerned
This time it definitely sounds like THE FATHER is the one
YELLING the words are INDECIPHERABLE As Owen presses
his ear to the wall he can BARELY make out a FEW FRAGMENTS

THE FATHER (THROUGH WALL)
-EXPECT ME TO CLEAN IT UP NOW
DONT YOU
(more INDECIPHERABLE
WORDS then )
-BITCH

There’s a SUDDEN LOUD BANG Owen jerks away from the wall
startled He LISTENS catching his breath but the
neighbors have GONE SILENT again A thought occurs Owen
gets up slowly moves to THE WINDOW PEERS DOWN AT

THE COURTYARD

After a moment there is ANOTHER BANG (a DOOR SLAM) at the
BUILDING ENTRANCE below and THE FATHER STORMS OUT into the
courtyard He LIMPS with his DUFFLE toward THE STREET
HOLD as OWEN WATCHES then as it STARTS TO SNOW CUT TO
A FROZEN LAKE - NIGHT

Large expansive still We HEAR WATER TRICKLING PAN TO

THE SHORELINE Where fresh water from a SMALL AQUEDUCT PIPE
flows into an opening in the ice The Father DRAGS JACK’S
BODY through the snow toward the opening it’s tough work
with his bad leg and Jack was a big man Finally The
Father HEAVES THE BODY into the water It FLOATS

Winded angry The Father finds a LONG STICK and presses it
into Jack’s chest He limps precariously along the edge of
the shore GUIDING the FLOATING BODY with the stick toward
the SOLID ICE

As it reaches the perimeter The Father THRUSTS the stick
against the body attempting to submerge it under the ice --
but it SLIPS and The Father stumbles almost tumbling in
He recovers carefully repositions the stick --

DEAD BODY’S POV - FLOATING ON WATER

looking up at The Father as he gets the stick in place He
is seething Using all his might his face contorting in a
brutal grimace he lets out a VICIOUS ENRAGED GRUNT and we
PLUNGE UNDER THE WATER -- the SOUND GOES SILENT -- we CUT TO

THE HAUNTING VISION

BLOODY CLOUDS billowing in MURKY BLUE WATER -- as we HOLD on
the horrifically beautiful image we HEAR QUIET BREATHING
Something OUT OF FOCUS DRIFTS DOWN into view -- just as we
GLIMPSE it is a SEVERED HEAD -- we HEAR A GASP and CUT TO

Wilt thou be gone It is not yet
near day

INT OWEN’S ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

ZEFFERILLI’S “ROMEO AND JULIET” plays on a 16 MM PROJECTOR in
the darkened class -- JULIET lies naked in the sheets staring
at ROMEO in the early morning light as he dresses preparing
to leave There is quiet GIGGLING among the class at the
romanticsexual content on the screen The TEACHER glances
up from a book at her desk then back down oblivious

Paying no attention to the movie Owen sits copying
something out of a BOOK it’s the MORSE CODE ALPHABET He
writes out the dots and dashes for each corresponding letter
with a certain intensity an urgency

Across the room Kenny sits with a long broken-off
RETRACTABLE CAR ANTENNA in his hand -- smiling slyly he
stretches the antenna out to its full length reaches over
taps the shoulder of A CHUBBY GIRL WITH GLASSES in the next
aisle then quickly pulls it away retracts it again The
Girl turns annoyed can’t figure out who’s tapping her

Pleased Kenny turns looking for his next victim when he
spots Owen on the other side of the room copying The
sight of Owen so deeply immersed in something somehow irks
Kenny he stares at him darkly wondering what he’s up to

HOLD on Owen as he writes He starts to bounce his leg
anxious excited He pinches his crotch reflexively
Has to pee But keeps right on working On a mission

ON THE SCREEN Romeo kisses Juliet farewell --
ROMEO
I must be gone and live or stay
and die
INT BATHROOM STALL - DAY
CLOSE ON OWEN as he finishes peeing He zips his fly and

reaches out his leg about to flush the toilet with his shoe
when he hears a group of FOOTSTEPS in the bathroom -- the

sound of METAL SCRAPING echoes Owen freezes
There is a KNOCK at the stall door Owen remains perfectly
still Then a loud BANGING Finally Owen flushes

unlocks the door opens it steps slowly --
OUTSIDE THE STALL

Frustrated Kenny swings higher SLASHES OWEN’S FACE Owen
stiff as a board clenches his eyes shut his cheek BLEEDING

peeled back some of the cardboard and newspaper stands there
WATCHING He looks JEALOUS

INT OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT 53

Still fully dressed Owen lies studying his Morse Code cheat
sheet on his bed close to the wall listening for Abby
Suddenly he HEARS a MUFFLED COMMOTION from next door

ABBY (THROUGH WALL)
---Move

I have to get in there

Owen listens concerned
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL 54

We WATCH through a DOORWAY as The Father sits on a naked
mattress next to the wall newspaper in hand a SMALL
TRANSISTOR RADIO playing CLASSICAL MUSIC at his side He
stares up at Abby who waits impatiently for him to move

Finally looking almost wounded he picks up his little radio
and gets up limping away toward the doorway -- he starts to
close the door as BEHIND HIM we SEE Abby climb onto the
mattress with her cheat sheet -- she KNOCKS once a KNOCK
comes back --

CLOSE ON The Father’s face as he finishes shutting the door
in the FG He stands there listening very perturbed

BACK IN OWEN’S ROOM 55
Owen starts to TAP out his message on the wall to Abby

SWEE

CLOSE ON his cheat sheet as he continues -- on the paper he
has written out the code for the phrase “SWEET DREAMS”

his look of infinite compassion Owen stares back wary

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENTS - TWILIGHT

Owen quietly exits his apartment walks next door to Abby’s
He KNOCKS on the door when he hears IRREGULAR FOOTSTEPS --
he turns to see THE FATHER approaching from the stairwell
carrying an empty plastic trash can

As he sees Owen The Father slows to a stop stares stone-
faced menacingly Owen smiles at him unsure a little
afraid After a LONG BEAT The Father sighs slowly then
speaks very quietly ominously

THE FATHER
You know I was like you once

Owen stares at him uncomfortable Then even more quiet
THE FATHER
(almost to himself)
I was just like you

Beat Owen is bewildered Growing anxious he utters

OWEN
--Is Abby home

But The Father just keeps staring lost in thought -- just
as Abby opens the door She starts to smile seeing Owen --
but her smiles fades as she sees The Father too Wonders
what exactly is going on out here

Relieved Owen turns to her

OWEN
Hey

Her smile immediately returns

ABBY
Hey
And the two of them head off down the hall together as The
Father watches Abby steals a look back at him Glares
at him

INT JEFFERSON COUNTY VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT

Owen saw the Tenth Grade couple French kissing earlier
Abby watches fascinated as Owen plays with great intensity
As he dies Owen scrunches his face laughs he gestures it’s
Abby’s turn She takes the joystick unsure but smiling

THE CANDY COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

Owen puts down the TWENTY DOLLAR BILL to pay for a bunch of
PACKAGES OF NOW AND LATERS he gestures to the candy so
excited he has to SHOUT over the BLASTING VIDEO GAME SOUNDS

OWEN
Want some They’re really good
They’re my favorite

Abby looks at the candy oddly uncomfortable --

ABBY
(shakes her head waves
her hand)
No I don’t want it

Owen is a bit hurt she doesn’t want to at least to try some
but he makes the best of it points to the display

OWEN
Well What do you like

Abby tries to be polite it comes off colder than she means

ABBY
I don’t really eat this stuff

OWEN
(nods smiles a letdown)
Oh Okay

Owen turns to the Seventeen Year Old Counterman

OWEN
I guess that’s it

The Counterman takes the cash gives Owen the change Abby
watches as Owen collects his candy trying to hide his
disappointment She feels bad

ABBY
Well maybe I could try just
one

Owen looks up suddenly excited He opens a package gives

her a piece She puts it in her mouth He watches for her

reaction She smiles for him nods He grins so pleased --
CUT TO

EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER 61

Abby stands VOMITING VIOLENTLY bent over against the side of

a building Standing back a bit Owen watches feeling just

terrible Finally she looks up embarrassed sad

ABBY
-SOrry

Owen looks at her there seeming so thin so frail so broken

-- his heart aches He so wants to comfort her He
moves to her awkwardly and out of nowhere just puts his
arms around her holds her tight

Abby stands there stiffly arms at her side a bit stunned
Finally she relaxes her body gives in to him She rests
her head against his But her eyes look troubled Then

As she listens Abby’s EYES DRIFT to OWEN’S BARE NECK -- so
tantalizingly close to her mouth Her PUPILS WIDEN subtly
involuntarily -- she catches herself has to resist her
impulses She stiffens pulls away afraid

Owen looks at her confused

OWEN
- Why

She smiles sadly recovering looks down at her shoes shakes
her head

ABBY
No reason

apartment She watches as he shuts the door

Then she starts to open her own door

INT ABBY’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Abby enters to find The Father grimly packing up his duffle --

she watches unseen by him as he gently places the freshly
washed plastic jug in the bag next to the “Slim Jim” and a
SMALL JAR FILLED WITH CLEAR LIQUID he carefully checks the

jar’s lid making sure it’s secure Finally Abby speaks

ABBY
You going out

He looks at her Then gets back to work Not looking at her
as he finally speaks quietly bitterly The air is tense

THE FATHER
Is there a choice

She watches him growing anxious wary

ABBY
--You look tired Maybe you
shouldn’t go tonight

THE FATHER
(still not looking at her)
What else am I good for

Finally she moves over to him slowly He turns seeing her
there Despite himself he softens lowers himself to her
She touches his face He closes his eyes Then opens them
looks down vulnerable

THE FATHER
Please don’t see that boy again
Okay

He looks up at her But she can’t hold his gaze She looks
down He hardens again knows what that means He gets up

CIGARETTES on the counter Picks them up

CUT TO
EXT YMCA PARKING LOT - LONG LENS SHOT - NIGHT

OUT OF FOCUS SMOKE rises in the FG around The Father’s
BLURRY SILHOUETTED HEAD as he watches the YMCA in the
distance A group of TEENAGERS head for the entrance
laughing unaware of him

A powder blue CHEVY CHEVETTE chugs into the lot A lone
HIGH SCHOOL AGED KID gets out starts toward the building
PULL FOCUS to back of The Father’s head as he watches still
He takes a last long drag on his cigarette then FLICKS it
away the burning ashes sparkle briefly

INT CHEVY CHEVETTE - LATER
LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD from the back seat the lot
is mostly empty now it’s closing time The HIGH SCHOOL AGED

KID appears coming towards us

He reaches the driver door starts to unlock it THE CEILING
DOME LIGHT illuminates as the door creaks open --

REVEAL just out of the light hidden on the floor behind the

bucket seats THE FATHER lies face-up in the cloth mask
HOLD TIGHT on his eyes as he listens motionlessly to the
sounds of the Kid climbing in and shutting the door

In one gloved hand The Father holds a SMALL AMBER APOTHECARY
BOTTLE OF CHLOROFORM in the other a SMALL CLOTH RAG

The Kid starts the car -- The English Beat’s “Mirror in the
Bathroom” BLARES SUDDENLY from the cheap radio The Kid is
about to pull out when he SEES --

A LANKY TEEN

in the distance YELLING URGENTLY WAVING him down as he
makes his way toward the car

The Kid lowers the radio rolls down his window

HIGH SCHOOL KID
(calling across the lot)

What’s up man

CLOSE ON The Father’s eyes as they fill with alarm What
is this now

Finally the Lanky Teen arrives at the window out of breath
LANKY TEENAGER
Can I get a ride Kip’s going over

to see his girlfriend

HIGH SCHOOL KID
Yeah sure get in

THE FATHER

listens horrified as the Lanky Teen scrambles into the

passenger seat HIS EYES WIDEN as he sees the LANKY TEENS
ARM swing back between the front seats gripping a GYM BAG --
the arm blindly tosses the bag -- it lands right on top of

The Father’s legs

HOLD on The Father as they start to drive brief waves of
sodium vapor street light wash over him as his mind races --
SUDDENLY the Lanky Teen’s HAND reaches back fumbling for
something at the base of his seat right by The Father’s
head Panicked The Father tries to back away but the space

is very tight --

LANKY TEENAGER (0S)
(as his hand fumbles)
Kip is so fucking whipped man -- I
can’t even deal with it anymore --

HIGH SCHOOL KID (0S)
What are you doing --

LANKY TEENAGER (0S)
I’m trying to move the fuckin’
seat dude

HIGH SCHOOL KID (0S)
It’s in the front --

The Lanky Teen’s hand finally withdraws but his seat comes
sliding forcefully back thrusting violently into The

Father’s shoulder -- the Teen has to use some extra effort
before the seat finally locks into place crushing The Father
hard -- he clenches his eyes shut in pain

“Mirror in the Bathroom” keeps playing as more waves of
sodium vapor light pass by the tires ka-thunk ka-thunk over
a gentle bump in the road and as The Father opens his eyes
the car starts to flood with FLUORESCENT LIGHT -- it gets
BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER

LANKY TEENAGER (0S)
You need gas

HIGH SCHOOL KID (0OS)
Yeah

EXT GAS STATION CONVENIENCE MART - NIGHT 67
And The Father opens his eyes as the car comes to a STOP

We HEAR the sounds of one of the doors opening someone
getting out the door slamming shut

The Father carefully lifts his head peeks through the space
between the two front seats -- the High School Aged Kid is
walking away from the car through the quiet STATION toward
the CONVENIENCE MART The Father’s eyes drift down to the
dash -- the KEYS are still in the ignition --

A HAND (the Lanky Teen’s) suddenly reaches into view
punching the channel presets on the radio Asia’s “Heat of
the Moment” starts to play The hand turns it up

IN FRONT

The Lanky Teen bobs his head absently to the music He
glances around spots an open pack of cigarettes in the
center console He picks the pack up -- it’s empty He pats
the pockets of his coat looking for his own pack Nothing

Then realizing he turns slightly reaching his arm --

INTO THE BACK

toward his gym bag The Father remains perfectly still as
the Lanky Teen slips his hand into the gym bag feeling
around for his cigarettes can’t seem to find them

Frustrated the Lanky Teen twists to get a better look at his
bag -- when he spots THE FATHER’S SHOES With dawning
alarm he quickly cranes his head farther around to SEE --

THE FATHER staring at him from behind the cloth mask

In utter panic the Lanky Teen LURCHES for the door -- JUST
AS -- The Father LUNGES DESPERATELY forward up on his knees
reaching quickly around the top of the bucket seat pulling
the Teen into a FRANTIC CHOKEHOLD before he can escape The
Teen THRASHES his legs and arms -- it’s vicious ugly --

INT GAS STATION CONVENIENCE MART - PAY COUNTER - IMMEDIATELY 68

MUZAK softly plays as THROUGH THE STORE WINDOW partially
obscured through the MAGAZINE RACK we see the VIOLENT
THRASHING continuing inside the Chevette -- in the FG the
OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE of the High School Aged Kid pays for gas

HIGH SCHOOL KID
(handing cash to CLERK)
Can I have ten on number seven

PULL FOCUS and TRACK WITH HIM as he turns and starts for the
door surely about to see the mayhem WHEN HE HEARS

A FRIENDLY VOICE
‘Sup Jenner

He turns to see TWO MASSIVE GUYS in FOOTBALL JACKETS
approaching with SLURPEES and hot dogs

HIGH SCHOOL KID
Hey Guys -- what’s goin’ on

INSIDE THE CHEVETTE 69

“Heat of the Moment” BLASTS as the Lanky Teen’s feet dig
against the dash -- he slams his hands blindly against sides
of The Father’s head but The Father won’t let go --

Still clutching the bottle of chloroform The Father
struggles to unscrew the lid with one hand -- the Teen grabs
onto the cloth mask primitively twisting and pulling it and
the hair beneath it --

Grimacing in terrible pain The Father finally gets the lid
off the chloroform -- he tries to force the mouth of the
bottle up under the Teen’s nose but the Teen shakes his head
madly to avoid it --

SUDDENLY the cloth mask tears free in the Teen’s fists along
with large clumps of The Father’s hair We can now see The
Father he’s beet red sweating sneering foaming at the
mouth In total fury adrenaline surging he tightens his
chokehold and slowly forces the open bottle up under the
Teen’s nose as the Teen gags pitifully he holds it there
rigid trembling until finally the Teen SUCCUMBS
The Father’s muscles slump in disgust in the horrible
aftermath he glances furtively around to make sure no one
has seen --

INT GAS STATION CONVENIENCE MART - IMMEDIATELY

The three guys still chat near the entrance when one of them
suddenly notices THE FATHER STARTING THE CHEVETTE --

FOOTBALL GUY ONE
Hey -- isn’t that your car --

They turn --

HIGH SCHOOL KID
What the fuck --

INSIDE THE CHEVETTE
The Father puts the car into gear when he sees --
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The three guys RUNNING at him CONVERGING around the car --

One of the massive Football Guys BANGS on the driver window --
panicked The Father tries to hide his face as he thrusts

the car into reverse -- JUST THEN -- the other Football Guy
APPEARS on the passenger side suddenly spooked at the sight
of the Lanky Teen passed out --

The Father HITS THE GAS --

The Football Guys RUN WITH HIM SLAMMING THE WINDOWS --
But he keeps ACCELERATING -- as he starts to pull away one
of the guys furiously HURLS HIS SLURPEE at the windshield --
it SPLASHES BRIGHT RED ACROSS THE GLASS --

MADLY ACCELERATING IN REVERSE The Father BACKS OUT ONTO THE
STREET -- THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW we see AN ONCOMING PICK-
UPTRUCK --

The Father yanks the wheel to avoid it and the Chevette
SWERVES and SCREECHES and we CAREEN OUT OF CONTROL --

-- DOWN AN EMBANKMENT --

THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS STARTS TO SWIRL UP-SIDE-DOWN AS
WE FLIP SIDEWAYS -- AND TUMBLE -- SPINNING DOWN THE HILL --

GLASS SHATTERS

METAL CRUNCHES AND GROANS

UNTIL FINALLY the car comes to a REST

EXT BOTTOM OF EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

Completely dazed The Father looks around him Eerily “Heat
of the Moment” still plays on the radio The Lanky Teen lies
slumped against him battered and bloody The Father tries

to climb out of his seat but he can’t move -- he looks down -
- the dashboard and steering column have caved forward -- HIS
LEGS ARE TRAPPED He struggles fiercely but there is
nothing he can do -- JUST THEN --

-- he HEARS APPROACHING VOICES in the distance -- he peers
sideways out the broken and spidered windshield -- THE THREE

GUYS ARE CLIMBING DOWN THE EMBANKMENT

Distraught he starts to look around the vehicle He
turns starts frantically digging in the back seat grunting
reaching his arm as far as his trapped legs will allow

He tosses aside the Lanky Teen’s gym bag unearths his own
BLACK DUFFLE he reaches inside searching until
finally his hand emerges HOLDING THE GLASS JAR OF CLEAR
LIQUID WE SAW HIM PACKING EARLIER

The Father brings the glass jar forward reaches down
unscrews the lid -- he lifts the jar near his head breathing
hard HESITATING when -- he HEARS the VOICES of the HIGH
SCHOOL KIDS right outside -- NEARBY BRUSH CRUNCHES UNDER
THEIR FEET --

In total anguish The Father braces himself with not a
moment to lose -- he WHISPERS a final PAINED CRY --

THE FATHER
--Abby

-- then DOUSES HIMSELF WITH THE LIQUID pouring it over his
head -- and as it STARTS to SIZZLE and SMOKE -- we realize
it’s ACID --

EXT EMBANKMENT - WIDE SHOT - IMMEDIATELY

We are LOOKING DOWN OVER THE WRECKAGE as the three guys near
the car -- they stop in their tracks as they suddenly hear
THE FATHER’S HORRIFYING SCREAMS

CUT TO
INT OWEN’S ROOM - OVERHEAD SHOT - NIGHT
Quiet Dark Owen lies in bed staring up at the ceiling
deep in thought The faintest smile grows on his face then
fades away Finally unconsciously he reaches out his hand
gently touches the wall pressing his palm flat tenderly

against it --

INT ABBY’S ROOM - OVERHEAD SHOT - AT THAT SAME MOMENT

Abby lies on the mattress her hand already on the wall as
if touching Owen’s on the other side Still fully dressed
she lies there perfectly still when a LOW inhuman GROWL
breaks the silence Abby rolls onto her side clutching
her stomach looking frail Hungry Alone

INT OWEN’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - WEIGHT ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Owen lies grunting on a weight bench struggling hard with
some very light chest presses as Mr Zoric sits nearby
reading the NEWSPAPER -- the HEADLINE reads “RITUAL KILLER
CAUGHT IN THE ACT -- SUSPECT ATTEMPTS SUICIDE --
HOSPITALIZED IN CRITICAL CONDITION”

Zoric looks up from the paper sees Owen awkwardly battling
the weight -- puts down the paper helps him lift the bar
safely up Owen looks at him a bit embarrassed at how
weak he is but Zoric nods encouragingly

MR ZORIC

trying to adjust the reception as the Newscaster continues

NEWSCASTER
The suspect is hospitalized in

far for authorities to determine his
identity

EXT APARTMENT COURTYARD - NIGHT 80

Owen sits alone on the jungle gym with his Rubik’s Cube
He’s got two sides done and is working on a third Losing
interest he stops looks up at the boarded up windows of
Abby’s apartment stares for a long time Waiting
Finally he SIGHS disappointed wondering where she is

Oblivious the ADMITTING NURSE sits reading a magazine

After a moment Abby enters walks slowly to the counter she
puts on a bit of an act looking sad lost there are
snowflakes in her hair

ABBY
Excuse me I’m looking for my
father

ADMITTING NURSE
Is he a patient here

ABBY

ADMITTING NURSE
(suddenly realizing who

Oh I see

Abby looks up vulnerable looks like she might cry

ABBY
Do you know where he is

The Nurse looks at her for a beat feeling terrible for her
tries to be gentle

ADMITTING NURSE
He’s he’s on the tenth floor

Beat she looks at Abby with a sad smile picks up the phone
ADMITTING NURSE

Look -- why don’t I call them tell
them you’re here --

But Abby immediately starts to back off --

ABBY
-- Oh no -- that’s okay

And she heads for the door Surprised the Nurse watches her
go still holding the phone Then just before Abby exits
she notices something with horror -- Abby is barefoot

ADMITTING NURSE
(under her breath)
Oh my God -- you poor thing

She hangs up the phone and runs after Abby --

ADMITTING NURSE
Hey -- Sweetie --

EXT FRONT OF HOSPITAL - WIDE SHOT - IMMEDIATELY
The Admitting Nurse comes out to see that Abby is already

gone nowhere to be found She looks around confused
concerned Finally she turns heads back

As she re-enters the building we HOLD -- a SHADOW on the
FACADE three floors up suddenly STARTS MOVING -- STARTS
CLIMBING -- it’s ABBY

INT TENTH FLOOR HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

SNOW SWIRLS outside the window We HEAR the OMINOUS
RHYTHMIC HISSING of a RESPIRATOR just OFF-SCREEN After a
moment Abby appears crouching on the ledge She STARES
at something OS pained then knocks gently on the glass

HOLD

We HEAR a RUSTLING of SHEETS Abby waves sadly as a BLURRY
FIGURE starts to make his way slowly INTO FRAME It’s The
Father his face ravaged by acid he hobbles weakly to the
window wheeling his IV and HEART MONITOR with him AN AIR
TUBE snakes from his neck He pulls open the window

ABBY
-May I come in

He gestures to his twisted mouth his neck he can’t talk

Abby nods The Father leans his head out the window close
to hers She looks at him heartbroken her eyes start to

tear

She looks down terribly ashamed whispers
ABBY
--I’m sorry I’m so sorry
About everything

She looks back up at him tears streaming down her cheeks

Struggling he reaches out touches her face Gently wipes
away her tears She takes his hand in both of hers
presses it to her cheek Closes her eyes Trembling A
painfully deep history and connection suddenly apparent

Finally starting to recover she looks up at him
vulnerable At a loss She smiles sadly

ABBY
I don’t know what to do
(then kindly)
Thomas What would you like me to
do

He looks at her hesitating Then he reaches up to the tube
in his neck and YANKS it out -- an ALARM on the MONITOR
starts to BEEP The Father leans down vulnerably presenting
his neck to her gestures to it

Abby’s expression turns grave as she stares it him She
touches his head softly Then suddenly she bends down
and BITES into his neck -- BLOOD SPURTS she DRINKS DEEPLY

The WIND starts to pick up as The Father goes limp -- the
DRAPES are sucked out the window WHIPPING FURIOUSLY around
them as his body slumps -- Abby pulls aside blood dripping
from her mouth -- she watches as The Father starts to FALL --
he DROPS TEN FLOORS to the snow covered ground below --

A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM erupts from --
INSIDE THE ROOM

The HEAVYSET NURSE (from the opening of the film) has just
entered -- she RUSHES toward the open window where the DRAPES
TWIST WILDLY obscuring the view -- Realizing The Father
must have just jumped she puts her head in her hands
horrified --

The POLICEMAN bursts into the room and we REPEAT THE MOMENT
FROM THE OPENING OF THE FILM

EXT LEDGE OUTSIDE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

The Policeman leans out staring down at The Father’s body --
only now from this VANTAGE POINT we are able to REVEAL
something we couldn’t see before -- unseen by the Policeman --

ABBY

stands pressed to the wall watching terrified just out of
sight -- as the Policeman utters breathlessly --

POLICEMAN
Jesus Mary and Joseph

HOLD on ABBY as the Policeman retreats inside to GENERAL
CHAOS and YELLING As the OFF-SCREEN PANIC BUILDS Abby
moves to the edge of the ledge gazing solemnly down
Finally she LEAPS into the air and OUT OF FRAME

CUT TO
THE WORDS “ABBY I’M SORRY”

SCRAWLED in The Father’s handwriting in the POLICE NOTEBOOK
RED LIGHT STROBES over the paper -- we ARE

EXT FRONT OF THE HOSPITAL - LATER 85

The Policeman stares at words in his notebook haunted as
The Father’s body is lifted in the coroner’s van

A WOMAN’S VOICE
Excuse me Officer

The Policeman turns --

POLICEMAN
-YeSs

She moves up close visibly shaken by the proceedings

ADMITTING NURSE

She nods He turns to a fresh page in his notebook We
START TO PUSH SLOWLY IN ON HIM

POLICEMAN

INT OWEN’S ROOM - NIGHT 86

ledge The Father’s blood still stains her face She TAPS

on the glass

In bed Owen starts to wake up completely out of it Abby
whispers

He smiles Closes his eyes Abby stares at Owen’s back
gently caresses his shoulder running her fingers down his
arm and over his hand She takes his hand in both of
hers and lifts it puts is against her cheek closes her
eyes -- it’s a gesture eerily reminiscent of the one she made
with The Father just before he died And as they both
drift off into sleep

TIMECUT TO
THE VIEW FROM OWEN’S WINDOW - PRE-DAWN 87

HOLD for a LONG BEAT until the SUN just peeks over the
horizon FLARING CAMERA It’s beautiful lyrical

A THIN SLIVER OF GOLDEN LIGHT reaches over the bottom lip of
the window SLICES silently into the room projecting
patterns on the wall

REVEAL OWEN and ABBY bathed in SOFT BLUE AMBIENCE asleep in
bed like Romeo and Juliet The LIGHT reaches toward them

CLOSE ON ABBY’S ARM as the RAY of SUNLIGHT slowly spreads
out finally TOUCHING her SKIN -- the delicate surface
BLISTERS SUDDENLY starts to SMOKE --

ABBY’S EYES SNAP OPEN -- she yanks her arm instinctively out
of the light startled in pain She backs quickly away from
the light into the corner pulling the blanket around her
She looks around the room in horror stunned that she let her
guard down so low as to find herself right here right now
Beside her Owen remains blissfully in slumber

Her back to the wall Abby reaches over very very
carefully grabs the cord gently lowers the blinds

HOLD on her as she sits there catches her breath
CUT TO
THE WORDS “I MUST BE GONE AND LIVE OR STAY AND DIE”

WRITTEN on a small SCRAP OF PAPER lying on the pages of an
OPEN BOOK on Owen’s DESK Below the words a HEART has been
drawn LIGHT SUDDENLY SPILLS across the paper as we HEAR the
sound of metal BLINDS BEING YANKED OPEN A HAND enters
FRAME picks the paper up --

It’s OWEN having just gotten up he reads the note sleepy
He turns the scrap over -- it’s a fully ripped open package
of Now and Later candies He lifts the open book the scrap
was lying on looks at the cover -- it’s “Romeo and Juliet”
Owen looks back at the scrap -- SEES below the heart is
written “OWEN ABBY” Owen smiles

EXT OWEN’S WINDOW - MORNING

The window opens and out pops Owen’s head -- he looks around
at the great drop below to the narrow window sills covered
with undisturbed virgin snow How did she get up here
last night It’s impossible

INT SCHOOL BUS - DAY

Owen sits among a rowdy CROWD of MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS
silently reading his copy of “Romeo and Juliet” -- his brow is
furrowed the book is hard to understand The crowd starts
to get even more excited looking out the window -- Owen stops
reading looks out the window to see THE FROZEN LAKE as the
bus approaches It’s a school field trip Along the
distant horizon a PASSENGER TRAIN speeds

EXT BUS - MOMENTS LATER
The Students file off the bus carrying ICE SKATES some have

HOCKEY STICKS and HELMETS Mr Zoric and a FEW OTHER
TEACHERS supervise directing the student traffic --

MR ZORIC
If you play hockey you play this
side Free skate this side
Everyone careful for holes in ice
Stay Away From holes We be
watching So you play safe

As Owen starts to put on his skates with the others Kenny
Donald and Mark step up behind him -- Kenny puts his hand on
Owen’s shoulder leans in speaking to him quietly smiling

KENNY
I hope you been learning how to
swim Coz today you’re goin’

in

And the three bullies head out to the ice Owen watches them
go with a growing sense of trepidation and anger

CUT TO
A SMALL FROZEN AQUEDUCT PIPE 92

along the shore It looks like the pipe we saw the night The
Father dumped the body of the weight-lifter into the water --
only now the entire SHORELINE IS FROZEN SOLID

Owen’s feet trudge by the pipe in skates He is scouring
the area for something

A GROUP OF GIRLS skate into the area laughing trying out
their best (and not particularly impressive) figure skating
moves -- one of them is the girl Kenny accosted in the pool

Ignoring them Owen keeps searching he spots something digs
it out of the snow It’s a LONG STICK -- it could be the
same stick The Father used to submerge the body under the
ice though there’s no way to be sure

Owen BANGS the stick against his palm testing its strength
CUT TO

EXT MIDDLE OF THE LAKE - MOMENTS LATER 93

Kenny Donald and Mark make their way across the ice

Finally coming upon Owen who stands about twenty feet in

front of a HOLE IN THE ICE holding the long stick He

stares at them Kenny smiles

KENNY
Is she ready for a swim

Owen says nothing just sets his jaw but it is clear he is
very afraid He grips the stick harder raises it
slightly bracing himself for trouble Kenny notices

KENNY
Whattaya think you’re gonna do with

OWEN

(trying to be brave)
I’m gonna hit you with it If
you try anything
Kenny looks at his friends smiles mockingly

KENNY
Really Wow

NEAR THE EDGE OF THE LAKE

As he tries to organize a hockey game Mr Zoric suddenly
sees Owen surrounded by the boys near the hole in the ice
He watches them with growing concern

BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE

Kenny’s smile fades as he stares Owen down

KENNY
You know what I think

Owen remains silent

KENNY
I don’t think you’re gonna do a
fucking thing I think you’re

just gonna stand there like the

little girl you are And I’m

gonna grab that stick and ram it

right up your ass And then
(beat hardens)

You’re goin’ swimming

Donald sees something is growing uncomfortable with all
this says quietly to Kenny

DONALD
Dude -- Zoric is over there
checking us out -- let it go

We’ll beat his little ass later

But Kenny isn’t going to be the one to blink he just keeps
staring Owen is trembling

KENNY
Gimme the stick

Owen doesn’t dare move Kenny sensing weakness suddenly
lunges forward and Owen panicked SHUTS HIS EYES and
SWINGS THE STICK with ALL HIS MIGHT IT CONNECTS squarely
with the side of Kenny’s head and Kenny DROPS stunned --

MARK
Holy shit Are you fucking crazy

Owen opens his eyes shocked to see Kenny crumpled on the
ice gripping his ear in excruciating pain -- BLOOD GUSHES
Kenny starts to SCREAM --

MR ZORIC 96
turns hearing Kenny’s agonized screams -- one of the other
Teachers immediately heads toward the middle of the lake to
investigate -- Zoric is about to go too -- when he HEARS MORE

SCREAMS from the other direction --

He turns to see the GROUP of GIRLS at the shoreline by the
aqueduct -- the girl Kenny accosted in the pool is SCREAMING
and CRYING horrified -- Zoric starts in their direction

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAKE 97
The Teacher rushes to Kenny’s aid shocked by the amount of
blood -- Owen watches absolutely terrified at what he has
done -- He stands there frozen drops the stick
MEANWHILE AT THE SHORELINE 98
We watch in WIDE SHOT as Zoric arrives -- the girls are
huddled together comforting each other one of them points
to something by the edge of the lake -- Zoric looks and the
blood drains from his face He recovers starts to pull
the girls away -- then he turns back staring aghast

animatedly describes what happened to a MAN IN A SUIT who
has his back to us taking notes A PAIR OF COPS need to
squeeze by and Zoric steps aside still talking -- as he and
the POLICE OFFICER rotate switching places we SEE Zoric has

Owen looks up to see Mark the smallest of the bullies
standing there in his bathing suit -- he has a bit of a smile
on his face he’s hard to read

MARK
Look’s like you went for a swim

Owen glares at him wondering if this is going to be trouble
but seeing Owen’s expression Mark immediately backs off

MARK

And he moves off sheepish to the other side of the pool
jumps in Owen watches surprised is he afraid of Owen now

watches an OLDER TALLER KID (KENNY’S BROTHER) suddenly runs
up behind Kenny and playfully -- though brutally -- wrestles

pushes a shoulder hard into the door it opens REVEALING
INT APARTMENT COMPLEX - BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

A dim dingy concrete space but a secret world all its own
furnished with mismatched items salvaged from the trash a
SUNKEN ARMCHAIR an OLD COUCH a THREADBARE PIECE OF
CARPET BEER and LIQUOR BOTTLES litter the floor There
are PILES of DOG-EARED GIRLY MAGAZINES At the center of it
all is a BATTLE-SCARRED PING PONG TABLE a hole punched
through one side

Abby takes it all in walking around with a childlike grin

OWEN

There was this kid who used to live
in the building Tommy He used
to hang out down here with some of
the high school kids and they
would drink and smoke Anyway
sometimes when the older kids
weren’t around he’d play ping pong
with me He was pretty nice
but then he moved away

(beat looking around)
I kinda like it down here

ABBY

Owen quietly takes his PEN KNIFE out of his pocket He
glances at Abby then opens it presses his thumb carefully
against the SHARP TIP He swallows bracing himself
Then presses hard suddenly against the blade SLICING OPEN

HIS THUMB -- he GRIMACES silently in pain as it starts to
BLEED A LOT He smiles
OWEN
Okay let’s make a pact

Abby opens her eyes Owen holds out his BLOODY HAND

OWEN
--you and me

Seeing BLOOD Abby immediately FREEZES in HORROR and DREAD
Her PUPILS WIDEN like a FERAL ANIMAL about to POUNCE --

Oblivious to the brewing danger Owen steps toward her HAND
DRIPPING -- he offers the knife trying to allay any fears --

OWEN
It’s okay -- it only hurts for a
second it’s no big deal

Abby backs away her stomach GROWLING OMINOUSLY -- she holds
herself rigid FIGHTING VICIOUS HUNGRY URGES when
suddenly she SEES OWEN’S BLOOD PUDDLING on the floor --

-- HER EYES FIX ON THE BLOOD --

HOLD for a long suspended beat as --
SHE STARES MESMERIZED

LOSING HERSELF TO INSTINCT

Owen still doesn’t get it AS --

ALL AT ONCE Abby DROPS to the ground HOVERING FEVERISHLY
over the PUDDLE on all fours She SNARLS RAVENOUSLY --

OWEN watches in shock as ABBY STICKS AN EERILY LONG TONGUE
QUT of her mouth BEGINS LICKING THE BLOOD OFF THE CONCRETE

OWEN
(breath stolen)
--Abby

Abby suddenly LOOKS UP -- her FACE smeared with dirt from
the floor is TRANSFORMED She has DEMONIC EYES her
EXPRESSION IS TORTURED SAVAGE -- she doesn’t even look like
a child anymore QUIVERING PRIMALLY she HISSES arching
her back on the VERGE OF ATTACK

ABBY
Go away

But Owen can’t move he is terrified his eyes start to
well with tears Abby GLARES FURIOUSLY POSSESSED

ABBY

But he can’t Then -- knowing if she were to stay even an
instant longer it would be over -- she turns suddenly
making a break -- and RUNS WILDLY for the door --

CLIMBING SWIFTLY EERILY -- her nails SCRATCHING CLAWING at
the bark as she goes

AT THE TOP OF THE TREE

We FIND her settling in the branches RABID her SENSES
HEIGHTENED a HUNGER UNLEASHED NEEDING TO BE SATED She
peers around the courtyard below -- her pupils so wide her
EYES ARE SOLID BLACK Suddenly she HEARS a small dog’s
BARKING -- TURNS --

VIRGINIA is entering the courtyard walking her tiny dog
She’s moving fast angry like maybe she’s just had a fight --
fifty feet behind LARRY follows trying to catch up he

calls after her

LARRY
(out of breath)
Goddammit -- Virginia

But she keeps going towards her building -- and directly
into the path of -- ABBY -- who ABRUPTLY LEAPS DOWN KNOCKING
VIRGINIA FACE DOWN INTO THE SNOW

VIRGINIA SCREAMS THRASHING WILDLY as ABBY SINKS HER TEETH
INTO HER NECK TEARING FLESH -- BLOOD SPURTS out into the
snow as Abby begins RUTHLESSLY FEEDING SLURPING Beside
them the little lap dog growls and barks primevally --

Hearing the screams Larry begins to RUN He comes upon the
scene in utter panic and shock freaking out -- he LUNGES
suddenly at ABBY KICKING her FIERCELY -- and ABBY is KNOCKED
FREE TUMBLING into the snow --

Abby lifts her head stunned -- her MOUTH OOZES BLOOD PIECES
OF FLESH STILL IN HER TEETH

Larry sees the BLOOD pouring from Virginia’s shredded neck --
he starts for Abby in a blind rage --

LARRY
What the FUCK --

But before he can reach her Abby terrified snapping back
to reality TAKES OFF Larry SCRAMBLES after her SKIDDING
around in the snow but Abby’s agility and speed way are too
much for him -- and in an instant she’s gone

JUST THEN OWEN emerges into the courtyard dazed as
COMMOTION builds around him -- Larry RANTS desperately
totally out of breath as RESIDENTS APPEAR on their balconies
to see what’s the matter

LARRY
(crying hysterical)
Somebody call 9-1-1

He rushes to his girlfriend’s side as BLOOD STILL GUSHES
FREELY from her neck -- he’s in a complete frenzy --

Hangs up Leaving Owen back where he was Completely alone

CUT TO
ABBY’S NOTE “I MUST BE GONE AND LIVE OR STAY AND DIE”

Owen stares at it curled up on his bed He looks at the
HEART “OWEN ABBY” beneath it Finally he steels
himself and raises his hand to the wall He hesitates
then KNOCKS forcefully He waits heart racing
Nothing He turns away maybe relieved until a KNOCK
comes from the other side Owen turns back to the wall

INT ABBY’S APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 119

Abby opens the door slowly looking healthier than she has
been Sees Owen waiting there in his jacket The air is
charged They stare at each other Finally Owen says

OWEN
Can I come in

She smiles a bit wary nods He is about to enter then

OWEN
-You have to say it

She looks at him surprised by his tone her smile fades

ABBY
You can come in

He does she follows self-conscious as he walks down the
hall cautiously seeing her place for the first time It’s
desolate almost no furniture belongings in piles Spartan
The WORN OUT STEAMER TRUNK and LUGGAGE are piled in a corner
Owen takes it all in silently then he just stops where he
is hands in his jacket pockets not looking at her

OWEN
(quietly)
Are you a vampire

She glances down at her bare feet

ABBY
I need blood To live Yes
He looks at her
OWEN

Are you dead

No
(then)
Can’t you tell

OWEN

understand it herself)
But I been twelve for a very

long time

Owen glances around wary

OWEN
Where’s your dad

ABBY
(beat guilty)
--He wasn’t my dad

Owen looks at her nods He steps into the dining room

On an old table is a collection of STRANGE WORN OUT TOYS

from ALL DIFFERENT ERAS some looking like ANCIENT GAMES or
PUZZLES Owen picks one up -- it’s a VINTAGE INTERLOCKING
WOODEN CUBE almost like a Rubik’s cube from an earlier age --
there are faded RUSSIAN LETTERS painted on the sides

OWEN
What are all these

ABBY
(smiles sadly shrugs)
--I like puzzles

As Owen puts it down his eyes are drawn to a DOG-EARED
CRACKING BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOSTRIP tossed in among the
toys He picks it up to examine it It is a series of four
images shot inside an old photobooth probably circa 1940

There are VARIOUS POSES OF ABBY AND ANOTHER TWELVE YEAR OLD
BOY in front of curtain Abby looks exactly the same age as
she is now She and the boy look playful happy

Owen looks closer -- notices with a chill that the boy has a
PROMINENT DARK BIRTHMARK UNDER ONE EYE -- just like The
Father had Owen looks up at Abby but she doesn’t say a
thing just stares at him Suddenly uncomfortable he puts
the photostrip back down --

OWEN
(spooked starting to go)
I’m wanna go home now

But she BLOCKS HIS WAY sad doesn’t want him to leave

OWEN
I wanna go Are you gonna let
me
(then with an edge)
What are you gonna do to me

Stung she looks up at him then back down she steps out of
his way whispering heartbroken

ABBY
--Il told you we couldn’t be
friends

And Owen heads for the door She looks up watches him go
And as we HEAR the DOOR OPEN and SLAM SHUT we CUT TO

THE HALLWAY —- IMMEDIATELY 120

Where Owen stands outside Abby’s front door heart-racing
breathing hard through his nose trying to calm down

HOLD
Then --
CUT TO
EXT HOSPITAL - DAWN 121
HOLD as the SUN cracks over the horizon in the distance
CUT TO
A MOVING SHOT DOWN A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAWN 122
We FOLLOW a POLICEMAN approaching a HOSPITAL ROOM DOORWAY
As he walks we ARC in front of him to see it’s the SMALL
TOWN POLICEMAN he slows looks into
THE HOSPITAL ROOM 123
It’s DARK the DRAPES ARE DRAWN VIRGINIA SLEEPS in bed

she’s STARTLINGLY PALE ALMOST BLUE Her neck is heavily
bandaged an IV tube trails from her arm

Slumped but awake in a chair by the bed is LARRY he looks
like he’s been up all night He glances up at the Policeman
who SPEAKS VERY QUIETLY not wanting to disturb Virginia

POLICEMAN
Hi Are you Larry

Larry nods
POLICEMAN
You mind if I talk to you for a
minute

Tilts his head indicating the hall

LARRY
-Sure

Larry gets up EXITS FRAME -- but we STAY ON VIRGINIA we
PUSH SLOWLY IN on her sleeping as we HEAR the two men just
outside the door speaking in HUSHED TONES

POLICEMAN (0S)
Sorry to bother you
(then)
How’s she doing

LARRY (0S)
(grim shaken)
It’s been quite a night They
had to give her almost six pints of
blood We’re still waiting to
see if her body rejects it

As Larry speaks VIRGINIA’S EYES OPEN with a QUIET START as
if waking from a nightmare -- her PUPILS ARE SOLID BLACK

She looks around disoriented sees the IV DRIP looks down
at the line STUCK IN HER ARM A SPOT OF HER OWN BLOOD is
soaked on the bandage VIRGINIA STARES AT IT TRANSFIXED

IN THE HALLWAY

The Policeman nods sympathetic -- but there’s a sense of
quiet urgency as he speaks --

POLICEMAN
Well I won’t keep you too long I
just I need to ask you about the
description you gave Of the
little girl

BEHIND HIM OUT OF FOCUS IN THE DOORWAY we can just make
out some MOVEMENT in the shadows in VIRGINIA’S BED

POLICEMAN (CONTD)
(refers to his notebook)
You said she had dark hair was
around twelve years old and wasn’t
wearing shoes

LARRY
That’s right

The Policeman pulls something from his notebook shows Larry
POLICEMAN
Have you ever seen this man He’s a

suspect in a murder investigation

Larry looks at it it’s a SKETCH OF THE FATHER

LARRY
Yeah Maybe Looks like a guy
in our building Moved in a couple
months ago I think

POLICEMAN
Did he have a daughter Like the
girl you described

LARRY
I don’t I don’t know I’ve
only seen him a few times

As the Policeman listens the MOVEMENT in the room behind him
continues grows more active And now there are FAINT
SOUNDS in the darkness DRIPPING sounds

LARRY (CONTD)
(concerned)
Why You think this is related to
the murder case

POLICEMAN
Maybe We’re starting to think the
two of them may have been part of
some Satanic cult

LARRY
(aghast)
What
POLICEMAN
We found another body few days
ago Same MO The victim was

completely drained of blood

THE DAY NURSE appears silently behind the Policeman pauses
at the open door checking the patient file about to enter
unaware of the activity inside

POLICEMAN (CONTD)
But there were bite marks on the
victim’s neck Small ones Like a
child’s

LARRY
(horrified)
Jesus Christ -- what is that girl --
what’s going on

Over the Policeman’s shoulder WE SEE the DAY NURSE step
inside disappearing into the darkened room --

IN THE ROOM 125
She moves to the window OPENS THE DRAPES turns to SEE --
VIRGINIA

HUNCHED OVER GNAWING and SLURPING over her own arm like a
rabid animal -- suddenly feeling the light spill over her

body she TURNS --

BLOOD DRIPS FROM HER MOUTH -- and from a FRESH BITE WOUND ON
HER ARM -- SHE’S BEEN SUCKING HER OWN BLOOD --

Panicked the Day Nurse suddenly REACHES OUT TO STOP HER --

DAY NURSE
Oh my God -- what are you--

BUT VIRGINIA’S SKIN IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO BLISTER AND SMOKE
IN THE DAYLIGHT SHE SCREAMS IN AGONY and -- just as the Day
Nurse GRABS HER --

VIRGINIA SUDDENLY ERUPTS INTO FLAMES

THE INFERNO QUICKLY ENGULFS THEM BOTH -- WE HEAR A CHORUS OF
THEIR SHRIEKING IT’S A PURE VISION OF HELL

LARRY AND THE POLICEMAN

BURST IN from the hall -- the HEAT is so intense they are
forced to stop dead in their tracks They stare
helplessly at the scene in complete shock and horror

TIGHT SHOTS Reaching into the oven Owen gasps burning
himself trying to grab a tv dinner -- he waves his hand in
the air to cool it reaches for a pot holder in a drawer --

A NOTE on the refrigerator reads “HI SWEETIE MEETING WITH
THE LAWYER TONIGHT BE HOME LATER THERE’S A POT PIE IN THE
FREEZER I LOVE YOU GOD BLESS MOM”

The TV is on nearby -- Owen isn’t even paying attention

TV NEWSCASTER

One patient and a nurse died early
this morning when a five alarm fire
broke out on the tenth floor of
Jefferson County Memorial Hospital
The cause of the fire is still
unknown but authorities believe it
may have been electrical

Owen sits gets settled with his dinner just as --
There is a KNOCK at the door MORSE CODE

Owen stiffens CUT TO

THE FRONT DOOR

It opens revealing Abby She smiles hopefully

ABBY
-Hey
OWEN
(coolly)
-Hey

They stand there awkwardly Abby waiting to be invited in
Finally Owen opens the door a bit wider for her to enter

She smiles uncomfortably
ABBY
You have to invite me in
It’s your home
A quiet taunt
OWEN
What if I don’t
(then)
Why can’t you just come in

She looks at him smile fading

OWEN
Is there something in the way

She stares at him sorrowfully Finally she makes the
decision Steels herself Enters

Owen shuts the door and turns waiting skeptically

At first nothing happens She just stands there rigid
eyes fiercely locked on Owens

But then slowly something starts to happen her

breathing becomes labored and then she starts to BLEED
from her EYES her NOSE her MOUTH her PORES She
BEGINS TO SHAKE GRIMACING in UTTER TORMENT as BLOOD DRENCHES

her skin her clothes -- IT LOOKS LIKE SHE’S DYING --

Horrified Owen immediately regrets what he’s done -- lunges

forward grabbing her shoulders --

OWEN
No Stop You can come IN

Abby suddenly relaxes her muscles relieved Panicked Owen
looks at her to see if the bleeding has stopped It has He
immediately hugs her tight Closes his eyes Holds her
Then head on her shoulder still catching his breath he
utters to her anxiously quietly

OWEN
What was that -- what was going
on

ABBY

This is your home You have to
invite me in

OWEN
Why
ABBY
(simply)

I don’t know I just know that’s
what happens If you don’t

OWEN
(the unthinkable)
But what if I didn’t say anything
Would you have just kept bleeding
Would you have died

ABBY
I knew you wouldn’t let me

OWEN
(opens his eyes afraid of
the thought)
-But what if I did
Abby finally closes her eyes whispers quietly simply

ABBY
«eI knew you wouldn’t

INT OWEN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 128

Owen sits on the couch staring up at Abby who stands before
him clothes covered in blood Owen is still reeling

OWEN
--Who are you

Beat She looks at him a defiant look in her eye

ABBY
--I’m just like you

OWEN
What do you mean

Abby stares at him her demeanor changing she steps slowly
forward hovering menacingly brandishing an imaginary knife

ABBY
What’s the matter Are you scared
Are you scared little girl Huh

OWEN
(suddenly afraid)
-What are you doing

ABBY
Those are the first words I ever
heard you say Outside

Beat Owen grows self-conscious

OWEN
Yeah but I don’t kill
people
ABBY
But you’d like to if you could
To get back at them Right
OWEN
(quiet grudging)
yeah
ABBY

To get revenge --

OWEN
Because they hurt me because I --

ABBY
Because you want to live Just
like me
(then)
I do it because I have to To
survive

She looks at him becoming serious quietly pleading

ABBY
Owen Be me a little

She moves very close to Owen reaches out touches his face --

CLOSE ON OWEN’S EYES

AS HE SUDDENLY SEES QUICK FLASHES OF A VISION

We HEAR Owen and Abby QUIETLY BREATHING as we FLEETINGLY SEE --
DEMONIC EYES STARING at us --
A TWISTED MOUTH OPENS BARING ITS TERRIBLE FANGS --
ABBY (VO) (CONTD)
(whispers emotional)
Please For a little while
A CHILD’S SHOULDER IS RAVAGED FIERCELY BY THE TEETH --
THE CHILDS FEET KICK AND THRASH IN TERROR AND PAIN --

ABBY (VO) (CONT’D)
Be me

SUDDENLY WE SEE THE CHILD’S FACE -- IT’S ABBY --
EYES RED STREAMING WITH TEARS A LOOK OF UNSPEAKABLE PAIN --
IT’S THE MOMENT SHE BECAME A VAMPIRE -- SO MANY YEARS AGO

BUT AS HER MOUTH OPENS ABOUT TO SCREAM -- IT’S OWEN’S SCREAM
WE HEAR AS IF HE’S SCREAMING HER SCREAM FEELING HER PAIN

REVEAL OWEN --
Back in the living room His eyes red with tears

WE CATCH A FLEETING GLIMPSE OF ABBY’S EYES ANCIENT TIRED --
but before they fully register they are a child’s again

Owen and Abby stare at each other Silent Emotional

Owen raises his hand unconsciously rubs his shoulder in the
same spot where Abby was bitten in the vision

just had resonating in his head We can HEAR the SHOWER

Owen’s hand sets down the needle The Romantics’ “What I
Like About You” starts to play -- LOUD -- we are
INT OWEN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 131

Owen puts his hands in his pockets listens to the music
bopping his head subtly walking around the room He is
setting a mood trying to be nonchalant He spies a quick
look down the hall to see if Abby’s out of the shower yet

A moment later Abby appears wrapped in a towel clutching
her bloody clothes She slows hearing the music Glances
at Owen Smiles appreciatively Bops her head a little too

Owen sidles up to her hands still in his pockets He has to
yell over the music -- gestures toward his mom’s bedroom --

OWEN
You can borrow one of my mom’s old
dresses if you want

Abby looks at him nods appreciatively and disappears into
the bedroom Owen watches her go

After a moment Owen approaches the bedroom doorway drawn --
CLOSE ON HIM as he PEEKS in curious -- catches a FLEETING
GLIMPSE of ABBY dressing -- momentarily transfixed -- but --

Before she can catch him he ducks out of the doorway again --
walks back into the middle of the room

Abby emerges in an old out of date dress smiling She
spins shyly modeling it for Owen the first time we’ve seen
her in a dress she looks adorable Owen smiles blushing at
the sight of her -- when --

We HEAR the FRONT DOOR SLAMMING --

OWENS MOTHER (0S)
Hello

Panicked Owen grabs Abby’s wrist her bloody clothes and
they run into --
OWEN’S ROOM 132

Abby runs straight for the window opens it up -- she goes
right out on the ledge without hesitation --

OWENS MOTHER (0S)
Owen Where are you

Alarmed Owen turns toward his door --

OWEN
I’m in here I’11 be right
there
He turns back to the window -- and Abby is already gone A

bit stunned he sticks his head --
OUT THE WINDOW

To see Abby impossibly already sticking her head out her
window next door She smiles at him He smiles back

INT ABBY’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 133

Abby sits on the floor in her darkened apartment playing
with her puzzles bored lonely She stops for a
moment stares a bit longingly at the wall that adjoins
Owen’s apartment

INT OWEN’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 134

Owen stands looking at his mother who lies out of focus
passed out on the couch The only light in the room is the
blue pulsing from the TV SCREEN He stares to make sure his
mom is completely asleep as he slowly silently pulls on his
jacket Finally he tip toes past her OUT OF FRAME

As we HEAR the FRONT DOOR QUIETLY OPENING we CUT CLOSE ON
the TELEVISION it’s a local PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

TV ANNOUNCER
It’s ten o’clock Do you know
where your children are

We hear the DOOR CLICK SHUT as Owen leaves

A LONG ROW OF METAL APARTMENT MAILBOXES 136

as we MOVE ALONG them hearing FOOTSTEPS We STOP on ONE

A POV SHOT - MOVING INTO THE COURTYARD - EARLY MORNING 137
More FOOTSTEPS snow crunching underfoot as the CAMERA CREEPS
forward looking up at the WINDOWS in the BUILDINGS ABOVE
The CAMERA FINDS ABBY’S WINDOW BOARDED UP with CARDBOARD
The CAMERA STOPS So do the FOOTSTEPS

CUT AROUND TO
THE REVERSE ANGLE - POV LOOKING DOWN FROM ABBY’S WINDOW

THE SMALL TOWN POLICEMAN stares up at us forebodingly as he
stands in the courtyard beside the empty jungle gym

INT ABBY’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - EARLY MORNING 138
Lying in the middle of the floor covered in a blanket
surrounded by puzzles Owen wakes up Still fully dressed

he looks around disoriented Abby is not there

He spots a NOTE on the table “Hi Owen Good morning I am

in the bathroom Please do not come in Want to hang out

with me again tonight I really like you Love Abby”

Suddenly there’s a LOUD KNOCK at the front door Owen
turns He gets up moves very quietly into --

THE HALLWAY
He approaches the door carefully presses his eye against --
THE PEEPHOLE

The Policeman is right outside He KNOCKS HARD again

Owen FREEZES doesn’t know what to do He takes a step
backward and the floorboard makes a long sustained CREAK
underfoot

OUTSIDE
The Policeman turns hearing the creak knows someone is
inside -- he BANGS even harder on the door --
POLICEMAN
Hello This is the police
department

(bangs again)
HELLO OPEN THE DOOR

OWEN
stands there stiff trying not to make a sound WHEN --

THE POLICEMAN

suddenly DRAWS HIS GUN raises his foot -- and SLAMS HIS HEEL
into the door near the lock --

OWEN

JUMPS as the door STARTS TO CRACK -- He spins and RUNS --
INTO THE KITCHEN 139
FLATTENS HARD against the wall HIDING PANTING -- JUST AS --
THE FRONT DOOR 140

SLAMS OPEN and the Policeman enters gripping his gun --

POLICE OFFICER

He looks around straining to see in the DARK apartment --
INT ABBY’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN 141
OWEN

remains perfectly still against the wall as he hears
FOOTSTEPS CREEPING CLOSER And CLOSER

POLICEMAN (0S)
HELLO

The Policeman appears in the doorway to the kitchen RIGHT
NEXT to where Owen’s back is pressed -- we can see them both
but they cannot see each other

Owen holds his breath can feel the Policeman standing
nearby The Policeman GAZES in then moves on

Owen listens as he passes then he gathers courage darts
his head near the door jam and PEEKS

INTO THE DINING ROOM

where the Policeman continues his sweep He spots BOXES on
the side of the room peers in but it’s too dark to see

Owen watches with just one eye past the door frame as the
Policeman takes a hand off his gun and reaches up to the
cardboard and blankets covering the window -- he YANKS a
small section away LETTING SOME LIGHT into the room

The Policeman looks back in the boxes sees the WALLETS
WATCHES and CASH Then he sees SOMETHING BALLED UP on the
floor nudges it into the light with his foot -- it’s ABBY’S
BLOOD DRENCHED CLOTHING the Policeman looks at the blood

with growing alarm imagining the worst -- he puts both hands
firmly back on his gun -- fear creeping into his voice
POLICEMAN
HELLO

Owen watches in horror as --
THE POLICEMAN

turns spotting Abby’s NOTE near the table He reaches
with one hand picks it up reads it LOOKS UP AT --

THE CLOSED BATHROOM DOOR
Owen literally stops breathing for a moment staring with

dread as the Policeman RAISES HIS GUN and STARTS SLOWLY DOWN
THE HALLWAY TOWARDS IT

THE POLICEMAN’S POV

MOVING FOR THE DOOR We can HEAR his MEASURED BREATHING as
he CLOSES IN

OWEN

LEANS his head out into the darkened hallway watching the
Policeman’s back as he creeps away finally ARRIVING --

AT THE DOOR
The Policeman listens for noise from inside hears nothing

He reaches a hand down to the KNOB gently grips it tries
to TURN it slowly it MOVES

ALL AT ONCE he FLINGS OPEN THE DOOR GRIPS HIS GUN IN BOTH
HANDS AND GAZES IN --

It’s even DARKER inside He REACHES A HAND IN feeling
around for a light switch -- finds one FLICKS IT nothing

So finally he STEPS ABRUPTLY --
INT ABBY’S BATHROOM 143

looks around trying to see in the darkness As his eyes
adjust slightly he can just make out --

AN OLD STAINED BLANKET

spread over the top of the BATHTUB He leans in closer
still holding the gun the STAINS look like BLOOD

He reaches a hand free from his gun and quickly LIFTS off
the blanket underneath are MORE BLANKETS wrapped around
something in the tub -- something shaped like a BODY

The Policeman quickly PEELS those back too -- revealing ABBY

He stares at her moves his face close cannot tell if she is
dead or alive He glances above the tub now able to see
that the BATHROOM WINDOW is thoroughly covered with CARDBOARD
and BLANKETS SEALED along the sill with ELECTRICAL TAPE

He reaches a hand up feeling for the edge of the tape --
finds it -- and -- JUST AS he STARTS TO TEAR IT BACK --
LETTING A TINY BIT OF LIGHT IN -- A VOICE CRIES OUT -- AT THE
VERY SAME INSTANT ABBY’S EYES OPEN PAINED BY THE LIGHT AS
HER ARM SIZZLES --

OWEN (0S)

NO STOP
Startled terribly on edge the Policeman turns levelling
his GUN at OWEN standing in the HALLWAY behind him --

POLICEMAN
(spooked breathless)
Christ Almighty son --

-- AND BEFORE HE CAN FINISH ABBY LEAPS UP FROM THE TUB AND
ATTACKS HIM FROM BEHIND SINKING HER TEETH INTO HIS NECK

Owen watches horrified as the Policeman FLAILS VIOLENTLY
BLOOD SPRAYING as ABBY FEASTS GRUESOMELY VICIOUSLY --

THE GUN CLATTERS to the linoleum --

THE POLICEMAN GRABS A BLOODY HAND on the door frame to keep
from collapsing -- his TERROR-FILLED EYES LOOK UP LOCK ON
OWEN’S as he REACHES HIS OTHER HAND OUT -- PLEADING FOR
OWEN’S HELP --

OWEN stares back TORTURED

Unconsciously Owen’s HAND STARTS TO LIFT REACH OUT

HE STEPS SLOWLY TOWARD THE BATHROOM

The Policeman SEES OWEN’S HAND REACHING in his direction --
His BLOODY HAND LOSES ITS GRIP on the door frame and he
stumbles backward -- BUT HE PERSEVERES STILL REACHING
DESPERATELY WITH HIS OTHER HAND FOR OWEN’S -- WHEN IT SUDDENLY
DAWNS ON HIM THAT OWEN IS REACHING FOR --

THE DOORKNOB

OWEN GRABS IT YANKS -- AS THE POLICEMAN SCREAMS IN HORROR --

POLICEMAN
NOO--
AND THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT -- SEALING THE POLICEMAN’S FATE
INT ABBY’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY 144

Owen backs away from the door in complete terror listening
to the HORRIBLE SCREAMING AND BANGING from behind the door

It’s unbearable -- he TURNS AWAY TREMBLING

Finally he has to cover his ears

We HEAR GURGLING and then the tell-tale SNAPPING of the
Policeman’s neck -- and all of a sudden everything goes --

SILENT

HOLD

Abby emerges from the bathroom still wearing Owen’s mother’s
old dress from last night she has blood all over her face

Owen lowers his hands from his ears stands there stunned
Abby walks up behind him puts her arms gently around his

body Her expression is mournful no sense of victory at
all she utters sadly holding him tight

ABBY
Thanks
TIMECUT TO
THE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 145
Owen and Abby stare at each other silent A pained sense
of what is coming Neither sure what to say Finally

Abby the more experienced of the two speaks softly crushed

ABBY
Owen I have to go away

Owen looks at her at a loss vulnerable knows she’s
right but can’t even nod

She stares into his eyes it’s excruciating
Then she leans slowly toward him and for the first time

despite her blood-drenched lips they KISS a long last
tender embrace

Finally they part blood now on Owen’s lips too He stares
at his feet sadly knowing it is over she does too

Depeche Mode’s moody painfully sad “SOMEBODY” starts to play

continues “‘RITUAL KILLER’ SUSPECT STILL UNIDENTIFIED AFTER
SUICIDE” the POLICE SKETCH OF THE FATHER is pictured

Owen gazes at his desk dispirited no longer interested in
his clippings when he HEARS A CAR DOOR SLAM Suddenly he
fills with trepidation stands up moves to the window to SEE

A SILHOUETTED TAXI

IDLING in the driveway between buildings A FIGURE finishes
putting a LARGE STEAMER TRUNK into the trunk of the car
comes around opens the passenger door for a SMALLER
SILHOUETTED FIGURE who sits in -- Owen sees the outline of a
tiny BARE FOOT as it lifts up into the car just before the
door closes

PUSHING IN CLOSE ON OWEN

suddenly he HEARS YELLING -- his eyes widen seeing Kennys
Brother Kenny Donald and Mark storming into the room --
Kenny slaps the long row of light switches on the wall
THRUSTING THE HUGE SPACE INTO EERIE DIMNESS -- and the group
starts heading straight for Owen along the edge of the pool --

Everybody out Move lLet’s GO

Frightened KIDS climb out of the pool scampering away --

Owen panics -- lifts himself out -- and RUNS MADLY -- for the
LOCKER ROOM --

The bullies FOLLOW --
INT LOCKER ROOM 160

Owen skids on wet feet in front of his locker -- SPINS the
TUMBLER -- he rips open the door digging frantically into
his pants -- he finds his PEN KNIFE -- OPENS IT -- TURNS --

JUST AS -- Kenny’s Brother Kenny Donald and Mark all
stumble into the room converge around him

Owen looks at them holding his little pen knife trembling
shivering as he drips in his bathing suit

Kenny’s Brother smiles --

KENNY’S BROTHER
What are you gonna do with that

He starts slowly toward Owen who raises the knife his hand
visibly shaking As Kenny’s Brother closes in Owen stares
at him suddenly realizes he just can’t do it -- and attempts
to make a break ploughing straight into Kenny -- who GRABS
him -- they ALL GRAB HIM

Kenny’s Brother easily snatches the pen knife out of Owen’s
grip Then he SEIZES one of Owen’s legs and begins
VICIOUSLY DRAGGING HIM out of the locker room -- Owen SQUIRMS
in pain and panic -- as the others follow --

BACK INTO THE POOL AREA 161

Kenny’s Brother drags him straight toward the pool -- calls
out to Kenny and Donald --

KENNY’S BROTHER
Grab his arms Get his arms

They do and the three of them suddenly LIFT OWEN UP and
TOSS HIM INTO THE DEEP END OF THE POOL --

OWEN’S POV

PLUNGING into the water He FLAILS MADLY unable to SWIM

He GAGS VIOLENTLY BOBBING his head in and out of the water
GULPING for air Finally he manages to latch a hand onto
the edge of the pool He pulls his head up just out of
the water coughing

Kenny’s Brother’s feet appear beside him and he crouches
down next to Owen’s face holding Owen’s pen knife He
grabs Owen by the hair with his free hand -- Owen WINCES --

KENNY ’S BROTHER
(quietly)
Know who I am

Owen looks at him terrified nods yes

KENNY’S BROTHER
Good Then you know why I’m here

He stares at Owen Smiles

KENNY ’S BROTHER
We’re gonna have a little contest
Okay You stay under water for
three minutes

He moves the knife closer to Owen’s face

KENNY’S BROTHER
If you can do it I’1ll just give
you a little nick On your cheek
But if you can’t I‘1ll poke out
one of your eyes Got it An eye
for an ear

Owen looks at him filling with dread

OWEN
But that’s impossible

KENNY’S BROTHER
That’s your problem

Kenny still wearing a big bandage on his ear steps closer
over his brother’s shoulder getting a good look at Owen
He glowers at him preparing for revenge

Kenny’s Brother grips Owen’s hair hard Owen grimaces --

KENNY’S BROTHER
Three minutes Better take a deep
breath --

Owen starts to SUCK AIR IN -- AS -- WITHOUT WARNING --
Kenny’s Brother FORCES OWEN’S HEAD --

Owen PLUNGES DOWN EYES WIDE OPEN his CHEEKS PUFFED with
air BUBBLES trickle from his lips

KENNY

stares on bitterly as his brother holds Owen down

Seeing Owen’s arms flailing slightly under the water Donald
and Mark exchange a look suddenly worried that this may get
out of hand Mark looks at --

THE LARGE CHRONOMETER

on the wall as the SECOND HAND slowly sweeps

UNDER WATER

Owen starts to make WHINING sounds struggling to hold his
breath Panic fills his eyes -- a STREAM OF BUBBLES
flushes from his mouth --

THE BUBBLES

APPEAR on the water’s surface above Owen’s head -- seeing
them Kenny finally starts to get nervous too --

KENNY
(quietly)
Okay Jimmy

KENNY’S BROTHER
Shut up

Beat as they wait a bit longer then --

DONALD
C’mon man this is stupid --

KENNY’S BROTHER
I said shut up

They all STARE SILENTLY it’s starting to go too far

UNDER WATER

Owen is turning red it doesn’t look like he can last much
longer -- when SUDDENLY -- we hear a MUFFLED CRASH from above
water -- UNSEEN BY OWEN -- a SHADOW SWEEPS through the center

of the pool behind him -- as if something were flying over
the surface of the water -- we MOVE IN CLOSE ON OWEN’S EYES --

OWEN’S POV - SHALLOW FOCUS

staring into the MURKY BLUE WATER -- we BARELY hear what
could be SCREAMS from above the pool -- and we begin to SEE
BLOODY CLOUDS BILLOWING DOWN from the surface -- this is the
same exact image from OWEN’S NIGHTMARES -- THEY HAVE ALL BEEN
A PREMONITION OF THIS VERY MOMENT --

Something OUT OF FOCUS DRIFTS DOWN into view -- it is KENNY’S
BROTHER’S SEVERED HEAD --

BACK ON OWEN’S FACE

as he SEES it Behind him a PAIR OF WILDLY KICKING LEGS ARE
SUDDENLY DRAGGED just below the surface of the water all the
way across the pool TRAILING CLOUDS OF BLOOD as they go --

AT THE SAME TIME -- KENNY’S BROTHER’S HEADLESS BODY SLUMPS
into the pool right in front of Owen -- and the GRIP on
OWEN’S HEAD is RELEASED --

OWEN

SURGES to the SURFACE COUGHING FOR AIR SLAPPING MADLY at
the water -- he GRABS the WALL --

WE STAY CLOSE ON HIM AS HE GASPS FOR AIR PANTING HARD EYES
SHUT All around him we HEAR OFF-SCREEN SCREAMING MAYHEM
SPLASHING -- Then all atonce it finally STOPS

We hear only the sound of Owen as his breathing slows

A FIGURE quietly moves up next to him in the water He
opens his eyes SEES --

ABBY’S FACE

inches from his eyes staring lovingly at him to make sure he
is okay Flecks of blood and water spatter her face

She is like a vision

Owen smiles at the sight of her She smiles back Finally

she reaches over takes his hand in both of hers presses it

to her cheek Closes her eyes

We’re FOLLOWING on the back of a TRAIN CONDUCTOR He stops
FINDING OWEN alone in his seat backpack at his side --

CONDUCTOR
Scuse me son can I see your

ticket

Owen hands it over The conductor checks it then looks down
at the floor seeing the LARGE OLD STEAMER TRUNK among a few
other items of luggage the trunk stretches into the aisle --

CONDUCTOR
That yours

Owen nods The Conductor looks at it slightly annoyed but
then just walks off Owen stares out the window

Beat

A QUIET KNOCKING begins from inside the trunk MORSE

CODE Owen looks at the carton smiles He begins TAPPING a

message back as the TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE

Then he turns back to the window looking out as the TRAIN
GATHERS SPEED Outside it is SUNRISE

He takes out a piece of candy from his backpack puts it in

his mouth watching as the world moves past his BACK TO US

(sings quietly)
Eat some now save some for later

He’s leaving his old life for another
We see his FACE REFLECTED in the window he looks emotional

Eat some now save some for later

And as the TRAIN’S HORN RINGS OUT BUILDING -- we SUDDENLY --
