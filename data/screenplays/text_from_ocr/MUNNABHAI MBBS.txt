in atracksuit (GHANSHYAM) gets out for his morning walk As he is walking alone he notices a bearded man
sitting on the bench casually loading a gun Ghanshyam crosses him then looks back The man is walking behind
him still fiddling openly with the revolver Ghanshyam Seth’s walk becomes brisk which gradually turns into a
100 metre dash towards a taxi across the road its bonnet is open Ghanshyam rushes towards it shouting)

GHANSHYAM

(He sits down in panic inside the car There is no response from the driver behind the bonnet Ghanshyam leans
out and shouts He looks behind The bearded man draws a gun and shoots Munna dressed up as a taxi driver
looks out from behind the bonnet)

MUNNA

scream the bonnet is still up Munna breaks with a screech the car goes over a bump and the bonnet slaps down
on its own Munna looks terrified as he speeds on

Munna walks out with determination written large on his face He looks at a sign with a red
cross that says “Emergency” He gets a slight smile on his face Muttering the theme song
under his breath he faces the wall and runs slams into it The people around turn to see
Munna in a heap on the floor He gets up His head is bleeding He walks back To their
stunned surprise he repeats the act

As they stare Munna completely devastates himself He opens a door places his fingers in
and slams the door screaming in pain

Bleeding he gets up sees a stretcher and runs towards it not slowing down as it gets in his
path and trips him into a human canonball To the shocked disbelief of everyone around he
still manages to get up He sees a glass wall He smiles

MUNNA
Tum sab apun ko mil ke mamu banaya ha

SUMAN
(pampering a kid)
Jadu ki jhappi chahiye

Suman moves ahead and gives him a hug

phir kya munna ne chinki se yane suman se shaadi kar li us din dono bahut khush
the

Ek saal bad circuit ne bhi shaadi kar li ye uska beta hai sab ise pyaar se short
circuit bulate hai

Dean retire ho kar munna aur suman ka aspataal chalata hai Badi majedar jagah hai
mareejo ko davai ke saath saath carom board aur jhappi ke dose bhi milte hai Koi
naya patient aata hai to asthana kehta hai mamu lait ja form apun bad mein
bharenge

Ye rutom hai college ka naya dean isne abhi tak shaadi nahi ki Lekin iski papa abhi
tak rani ke piche pade hue hai

Munna doctr nahi ban paya phir bhi MBBS kehlata hai Miya bibi bacho samet

Aur ye main hu Main kal kolkata jaa raha huab vahi rahonga vaha in sab ki yaad
ayegi Khaas is munna ki mamu chalo ander chalte hai chalo chalo
