FIRST DRAFT
FADE IN
THREE JAGGED BOLTS OF LIGHTNING ARE FROZEN IN PLACE

Theyre etched in skin and fringed in blood -- they moves out
in slow motion -

-- and we PULL BACK and see the bolts are a crimson birthmark
on a well muscled arm thats lashing out --

-- and suddenly we crank back into real time -- the fist at
the end of the arm hits a face with a bone grinding CRUNCH --

- aS a very large man who is now tasting blood and reeling
backward we see where and when we are This is a makeshift
fighting arena -- just a small drawn square in the dirt the
same size as a boxing ring outside of a winehouse It’s
night and the ring has torches in each corner There are
about two dozen local men and women drinking cheering and
betting -- this is the working class date night in dark ages
Greece

The game theyre watching is called pancratium -- the ancient
Greek version of ultimate fighting The only rule is you hit
the other guy until he stays down - and instead of having
gloves that muffle blows these gloves maximize each hit
theyre leather straps with metal lining the fingers

As the large man straightens up his expression is marked
both by doubt and by those damn metal fingers -- hes got
four parallel slices on his face As he wonders what hes
gotten into the crowd shouts the name of the local kid

GREGOS is not as big as his opponent He is notably not as bloody as
his opponent But hes going to win and he knows it Gregos
stares at his opponent clicks the metal on his gloves
together almost musically and throws his head back come
and get it

The large man still cant believe this he tells himself hes
bigger hes stronger hes got to win He charges Gregos
with a wide blow --

-- and misses Gregos tucks under it and gives him a gut
punch that makes him taste the souvlakia he had for lunch
Gregos straightens him out with a blow to the chin --

the larger man is up and unsteady -- and Gregos drops him
with one last blow

GREGOS
(as he passes by)
You must do me the honor of a
rematch one day Just grant me
enough time to draw an audience

The almost unconscious fighter has no response as Gregos
cruises by

THE SPECTATORS GO WILD

and chant Gregos name We note that one person in particular
isnt cheering and looks a little out of place - a very OLD
MAN who tries to get toward Gregos but cant

GREGOS LEANS BY A TORCH

and cleans off the mud and blood with a goatskin of water A
friend of his LUCIAN walks up counting out coins in
his hand Gregos barely notices -- he is looking across into
the spectators at a beautiful WOMAN who is smiling at him

LUCIAN
An excellent bout Gregos Word
has spread to the other islands
that you are unbeatable at
pancratium Travellers whove seen
you always remember that lightning
mark of yours If we took your
game to them --

GREGOS
(smiling at woman)
Can you give me even one reason
why I would ever leave Thasos

LUCIAN
I can give you two Just as you
have run through all the women on
the island --
(gives him coins)
-- I have run out of people
willing to wager against you

GREGOS
(not listening)
Who is that girl

LUCIAN
Eh Shes the daughter of a spice
merchant Their ship sails on the
morning tide But thats not
important Think about the money
If we went beyond our shores I
could set up new matches --

GREGOS
Dont take life so seriously
Lucian
GREGOS
Pancratium is just a way to pay my
bill at the winehouse and I have
no plans beyond the next dawn
Lets leave it that way --

(smiles at girl)

-- and let me worry about setting
up my next bout

Gregos walks away from Lucian and crosses a crowd of
backslappers to get to the woman who caught his eye Gregos

takes her

hand and leads her away --

-- and the old man who was trying to reach Gregos fails -- he

cant get

through the crowd in time as Gregos and the woman

vanish into the darkness

DISSOLVE TO

EXT ALONG A COASTAL HILL ROAD - DAWN - GREGOS WALKS HOME

and its as perfect a morning as you could imagine Dawn is
spilling over the rocks and the sea -- and a dozen fishing

boats are
semi-vino
snatching

As Gregos

heading out Gregos is still enjoying a post-coital
buzz smiling as he walks the dusty road home
a fig off low branch without even breaking stride

eats his breakfast a horse drawn cart pulls by

DRIVER
Day has broken Gregos Why are
you not at work like your father

GREGOS

(puzzling over word)
Work Ive heard of it I think
Isnt it done by men whove grown
weary of emptying a skin of wine
or stroking the skin of a woman

(smiles)
The day may break you but Ive no
intention of letting it break me
Perhaps I will discover the joys
of this work you speak of --
perhaps ten thousand dawns from

now

(brightly)
Until then Herpaikos -- my very
best regards to your wife and your
daughters

The driver is past Gregos but he turns around at this last
bit -- what does he mean by that Gregos offers an unreadable
smile as an answer
So this is ancient Greece but this is a guy we all know
hes a kid who has no money no responsibilities and not a
care in the world and he wants to keep it that way for as
long as he can get away with it

He only gets ten more seconds before all that is gone

Gregos moves over the crest of the hill and looks down His
smile vanishes as he sees --

GREGOS POV - BLACK SMOKE IS TRICKLING UP FROM A FARMHOUSE

thats at the sloping bottom of this hill -- and its not
coming from a chimney The house is on fire

GREGOS SCRAMBLES DOWN THE HILL

as fast as he can running in between the olive trees and the
nets spread out below for harvesting --

-- and Gregos reaches an olive tree that is nearly at the
edge of the slope -- and he stops because he sees

GREGOS POV - A SOLDIER IS IN THE REAR OF THE HOUSE

and Gregos run sends down a dozen olives clattering onto a
wooden walkway The soldier looks up -- draws his sword --
and climbs up to investigate

GREGOS HIDES BEHIND THE OLIVE TREE

as the soldier trudges up Now Gregos is a little scared and
confused This isnt just a fire Why are armed soldiers at
his house

THE SOLDIER MOVES AROUND THE TREE

with his sword out -- but Gregos throws a punch with the
loaded pancratium glove on and knocks the soldier back

The soldier is knocked back but he is tough -- he swings
toward Gregos Gregos dodges and moves in close to grab his

sword arm -- they struggle for the sword and fall off
balance -

they roll down the hill each trying to get the weapon -

-and as they land Gregos has the handle -- and the soldier

rolls on top of the blade In an instant he is dead
GREGOS IS STUNNED

because its his first taste of battle and his first look at
death

Hes never been in a fight that had stakes higher than a
round of drinks

There is no time to reflect on this Because Gregos hears
this from the other side of his house

SOLDIER 1 (0S)
Hes returned Weve no more need
for these two

With that there are fresh SCREAMS of pain -- and Gregos
knows these voices Gregos pulls the sword out of the dead
soldier and runs into the house

INSIDE THE SIMPLE FARMHOUSE - TWO SOLDIERS RUSH IN

with their swords out Gregos wades into the battle without
hesitation - he is untrained but he is furious and he is
desperate to stop whats happening outside --

-- Gregos kills one soldier and sees out a window there are
more clouds of black smoke -- and more painful SCREAMS -—-

- blind to almost everything else Gregos hacks through the
second soldier and rushes outside --

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - GREGOS IS TOO LATE

We dont have to see this in great detail -- a glimpse of
stilled burning limbs at impossible angles tell us this is
over

The last SOLDIER moves into view - he is huge holding a
broadsword in one hand and in the other a blazing iron
torch that was the weapon used on Gregos parents The

soldier is charging Gregos from behind --

Gregos whirls around armed with nothing but rage --
CLOSE ON GREGOS EYE - THERE IS A CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY
that flashes across his pupil -- and --

A BOLT OF LIGHTNING CRASHES DOWN ONTO THE SOLDIER

and it locks onto the iron torch -- the soldier sizzles and
urns alive until the impact ocks him away from Gregos

The impact and the booming THUNDER knock Gregos off his feet
as well - and Gregos is stunned by more than just the
impact How could such a thing happen

Breathless and bloodied Gregos pulls himself to his feet --
no one else is left

He pulls down a simple tapestry from the houses entrance --
and he carefully lays it over the remains of his parents
GREGOS FACE

is a mask of rage and grief The carefree kid he was moments
ago is now gone forever

OLD MAN (0S)
I know why this was done

Gregos turns ready for another fight --
A VERY OLD MAN

stands nearby This is the same old man who was at the

winehouse before -- he is walking up the path
Gregos eases up -- this brittle character is clearly no
threat -- and he bitterly turns away
GREGOS
Theres no riddle here old man
Four thieves raided my home -- and

my parents’ only crime was being
so poor that they had nothing
worth taking

OLD MAN
Their only crime is not revealing
where you were last night
(off Gregos look)
There is much you must learn
Gregos and very little time for
the telling I know you loved them

as your parents -- but the truth
is you were not born of man and
woman

(beat)

The truth is this was done by the
will of the Titans

Gregos gapes at the old man incredulously He’s angry now
but he holds it in -- this is a harmless crazy old man

GREGOS
Go home old man Im in no humor
to hear the ravings of a religious
fanatic

But Oranos steps forward continuing --

OLD MAN
The Titans --
Gregos snaps now getting in his face --

GREGOS
The “Titans” jive only in
travellers tales -- a way for

children and drunkards to pass the
hours Now leave me in my grief
old man or you will tempt me to
dig seven graves rather than six

Even though Gregos is twice his size Oranos doesnt back
off - he grabs Gregos raised arm

OLD MAN
You have a lightning shaped mark
on your arm
(rolls back his tunic)
Did you find it odd a moment ago
that the lightning itself did your
bidding

Gregos pulls away clearly not ready to accept this

GREGOS
My “bidding That was -- an
accident A lucky one but an
accident all the same A storm
must be gathering nearby

The old man looks up at the perfectly blue totally cloudless
sky empty to the horizon of the Aegean -- and looks back at
Gregos

OLD MAN

You must lead an exceptionally
virtuous life to earn such luck as
perfectly timed perfectly aimed
strikes of lightning that blast
down from empty skies

(beat)
I understand you will not accept
my words or your fate easily No
sane man would But you must
believe in this Gregos You must

beat
These things are spoken of in
stories but they are the truth
These stories hint at the secrets
of everything in creation
Everything you see every stick
stone bird and mountain came
about at the bidding of Oranos
OLD MAN

All of creation came from his
mind - passing through his eye --
until it was realized perfectly
here He even created the Titans
themselves to help them rule the
world with benevolence -- to
control the world and its elements
for the good of all creatures

GREGOS
impatiently)
Yes yes -- and Cronus and the

Titans overthrew the rule of

Oranos and Gaea and banished

them -- beginning his own rule of

darkness and the end of paradise
(crosses to tree)

My father told me this tale when

I was five right under this tree

and I didn’t believe it as a child

either

OLD MAN

(a little angry)
And youve matured very little
since then So be silent now and
listen

(beat)
Cronus created six more gods to
help him rule But the Fates told
him that one day his creations
would rise up to kill him and take
over his rule Cronus tried to
destroy them - to scatter the
energy of his creations back to
the cosmos -- but --

GREGOS

(impatient)
-- but somehow someday the gods
will return - and overthrow the
Titans to rule in their place
Every child whos heard the story
writes his own ending to this and
makes up a new group of gods -- as
I did before I outgrew imaginary
friends and invisible heroes in
the sky Tell me your twist if you
must old man and be on your way
OLD MAN
There is a new turn to this story
(beat)

You are one of the six Gregos

Your true name is Zeus You have
not heard this name before -- no
one has -- but you shall be the

leader of the gods

Gregos stares at him What do you do with an old man who

breaks this news to you -- throw him out or laugh at him
GREGOS
And you are the leader of the
lunatics
OLD MAN

Cronus will hunt you and the
others until you are destroyed
Your only chance is to find the
others - join together -- and
fulfill your destiny by
overthrowing the Titans

The old man takes out a rolled map and opens it for Gregos
The map shows the Greek mainland and islands -- and there are
six symbols scattered around the map A lightning bolt A
trident A flame A rose A demons skull An eight point
star

OLD MAN
Just as you now bear the sign of
lightning -- the others will bear

these marks This map shows where
they may be found Their names are
Hera Poseidon Demeter Hestia
and Hades

Gregos takes the map

GREGOS

I cant believe your ravings old
man But I will search for those
bearing the mark if only to warn
them that fanatics are hunting
them too And when I find the
man - not a Titan not a god the
man who ordered this done --

(takes sword from

wali)
-- then I will do him the kindness
of sending him to his god at my
hand

OLD MAN

Hold that rage Zeus Fan the fire
of your anger that it may carry
you until you realize the truth
You must -- must -- accept your
destiny if you are to act upon it

(beat)
You and the others are not gods
yet You are still mortai - still
vulnerable -- and Cronus will try
to kill you before you reach full
godhood --

GREGOS
Stop it - Ill hear no more of
this madness

OLD MAN
Madness it is - madness that
shall enshroud the entire world
Have you sailed past your own
shores in the last year

CUT TO

INT CHAMBER OF TITANS - CRONUS

walks through a hallway and you dont have to watch for long
to see that hes a deity He is walking through what appears
to be a beautiful ornate stone palace --

OLD MAN (VO)
Beasts and monsters that have only
lived in nightmares of men are
becoming real It hasnt spread to
your home island yet but that
good fortune cannot last

(beat)
Oranos crafted every part of your
world piece by piece -- the seas
the mountains the skies -- for

beauty And just as Cronus meant
to destroy Oranos he plans to
obliterate that beauty -- piece by
piece -- in totality

-- but with a thought or a gesture his surroundings change
from the surface of the sun to an earthly meadow to the
bottom of the ocean

Literally the universe revolves around him

With a thought or a gesture a small hologram of a monster
appears over his shoulder -- and with a stroke of his hand
more grotesque features appear -- and he moves the monster
into the background hes in now the oceans bottom Once it
appears there we see its scale -- it is at least a hundred
feet high attacking a fishermans boat and shredding it

OLD MAN (V0)
From the skies to the center of
the Earth even as I speak to you
Cronus is sending these
abominations They are all
grotesque all different but they
have one thing in common they
prey on mankind Within months
perhaps weeks he will finish
transforming Earth into
Tartarus -- a nightmare dimension
where men will exist only as
tormented helpless victims

EXT AT GREGOS HOME - A CONTEMPTUOUS GREGOS
is still not buying this

GREGOS
Truly fascinating May you tell me
how you know so much about the
Plans of the gods and the Titans

The old man hesitates He knows what will happen if he says
these words He says them anyway

OLD MAN

I know all this because I am the
one who saved your life I am the
one who retrieved you from the
nothingness Cronus sent you to I
am the one who concealed all of
you I am the one who built every
single thing that surrounds you

(beat)
I know ali this because I am
Oranos

INT CHAMBER OF TITANS - THE SURROUNDINGS MELT AWAY
in a shockwave of energy around Cronus its like an alarm

has gone off one Cronus thought he would never hear Cronus
turns to the hallway --

-- and he doesnt move toward it -- it moves up fast at his
whim and he is suddenly standing in front of a statue of
Oranos crafted in a frozen tortured pose

A small whisper can be heard from the statue --

I am Oranos
EXT AT GREGOS HOME ORANOS CONTINUES
and Gregos is staring at him in disbelief

GREGOS
So the god of creation who
conjured our entire universe is
a brittle withered old man I
dont --

ORANOS

(urgently)
Listen to me now Speaking my own
name will mean my death If my
death convinces you of your
destiny it is a price I am glad to
pay

(quickly)
After you band together you must
use this chart to find the home of
the Titans You must destroy
Cronus or he shall certainly
destroy you That which wiil
destroy Cronus --

INT CHAMBER OF TITANS - CRONUS STARES AT ORANOS STATUE

and it begins to shudder under his gaze -- enamel peels off
stone slowly begins to flake and crumble -- the statue is
falling apart simply from Cronus focused furious stare The

whisper -- I am Oranos -- echoes and builds getting louder
and louder as we --

CUT TO

EXT GREGOS HOME - ORANOS IS CRUMBLING ‘T0O

as he is aging rapidly -- he already looked somewhere north
of one hundred but his skin withers whats left of his hair
is falling out his voice is a croaking gasp --

-- and Gregos amazed to see this is becoming a little more
open minded about the possibility of forces beyond our world

Oranos struggles to finish speaking but his skin and bones
are breaking down into powder -- his last dry gasp is

ORANOS
- will be forged in the fire --
of the sky --

And with that Oranos falls to the ground clutching the
chart -- and his body breaks into eax powdered ash A breeze
scatters Oranos through the worl e loved the most

Gregos bends down and picks up the chart -- a bit of ash
clings to it Gregos blows it off and looks at the chart
He may not believe everything hes been told -- but he is

going to follow this chart to his destiny From here on we
will refer to him by his true name

zeus
CUT TO
INT CHAMBER OF TITANS - CRONUS STARES
at the rubble of the statue of Oranos -- and the sound echoes

no more The chamber is silent But Cronus is troubled He
didnt realize Oranos was alive Now he must discover what
else he doesnt know

With just a thought the surroundings melt around him and
become --

ENDLESS CELESTIAL SPACE A TANGLE OF SILVER LINES

radiate out from a center moving in an infinite number of
directions Second by second the center shifts - and as it
does some lines break other lines start out the
surroundings change from day to night This is literally the
clockwork of time made solid

The only sounds here are murmurs of history whispering by
storms battles music cries blending as one The only

movements appear to be flashes of light zipping along the
lines out and back

Cronus stands at the center towering over it He looks at it
with frustration It is not under his control He calls out --

CRONUS
Fates
(no response)

Atropos --

From the light on the lines ATROPOS materializes by Cronus
She is beautful she is one sixth his size and she smiles -
she is not in the slightest afraid of Cronus

ATROPOS
Cronus Titan of Titans What more
of the future may we show you

The other Fates -- CLOTHO and LACHESIS -- materialize into a
human form They appear to get a sensual buzz from riding the
lines -- and they enjoy taunting Cronus chirping their

observations while flitting over the lines nearest Cronus
Their flattery is drenched in mocking tones

CLOTHO
We have already told you of your
end

LACHESIS

Those you created to serve you
will destroy you instead

CRONUS

No I killed them ail I sent each
of them back to the cosmos back
to the energy they were created
from

(a bit less certain)
But I heard a tale of a man
bearing the mark of lightning 1
thought it to be an earthly myth
and nothing more -- but I sent a
vision to human emissaries and
ordered that man killed --

ATROPOS
-- and you learned that Oranos
still lived Now the ail knowing
Cronus wonders about the others
who breathe only to overthrow you

As quickly as this line can be read the Fates zip onto the
lines travel over six of them into the past return and

reform As they finish each others sentences they mockingly
whiz around Cronus like dragonflies

ATROPOS
All six of them still live ail
powerful Cronus

CRONUS
That is impossible -- I destroyed
them

ATROPOS

And Oranos retrieved them and
recreated them Just as he created
you Monarch of The Universe

LACHESIS
Now these new gods are hidden on
Earth Scattered In face and
form you will not know them my
lord

CLOTHO
They live as humans They know not
who they are or what they shall
become king of all wonder

Cronus anger grows as they cheerily sing of his bad
fortune -- but he tries to hold it in He really has no power
over the Fates and can gain nothing by threatening them

CRONUS
Then you must tell me more of
their future You must tell me
where they may be found

CLOTHO
We must”™ —-

LACHESIS
- do nothing Cronus --

ATROPOS
- your power to command does not
affect the Fates Or time

Cronus locks eyes with Atropos

CRONUS
That may change Soon

Atropos flits in front of Cronus face And stops She nods
to the other two

ATROPOS
Follow me then If you can

As soon as she says the word can --
ATROPOS RIDES A LINE OUT INTO THE FUTURE

and she still appears human riding the line as it stretches
and zig-zags through all kinds of angles Cronus appears
motionless as he stands beside her -- but the fact that
everything around them is now a racing blurring streak tells
us theyre both moving at the speed of light maybe faster

CRONUS
Tell me what you see Tell me
where they go

ATROPOS
The further the future goes -- the
less solid it becomes

As Atropos moves along the line drawing knowledge from it
she becomes smaller less solid -- and more ethereal

The other Fates are riding other lines -- and they converge
onto parallel lines with the one Atropos is riding

CLOTHO
We can tell you that they will
learn who they are --

LACHESIS
-- and that they will find each
other --

ATROPOS

-- and they will come for you

LACHESIS and ATROPOS and CLOTHO
They will come for you

Cronus can’t hold his anger back -- he reaches out for the
Fates to crush them but the three beautful women burst into
light instead spreading around the wires --

and instantaneously Cronus is motionless standing next
to the center of the lines Atropos is now a giantess beside
him her lips just by Cronus whispering --

ATROPOS
They will come for you

The home of the Fates melts away --

-- and Cronus finds himself standing in his throne room
alone with her words echoing through the chamber

Another Titan -- RHEA -- is waiting to hear Cronus report
but she can see the truth in Cronus face

RHEA
The humans tell the story as a way
of nourishing hope that someone
will challenge us As an
entertaining lie

CRONUS
The Fates confirm the lie has now
come true Oranos treachery is
complete They will seek us out --
unless I find them first
1

Cronus crosses to a table -- and with a wave of his hand an
apparition of an island appears before him

CRONUS
I will destroy all six if I must
wipe every speck of dust from the
globe -- beginning with the island
where Oranos was found

Cronus sits down at the table staring at the apparition

LUCIAN
But why Gregos Why would these

Zeus holds back Hes not going to repeat the story hes been
told because hes still struggling to believe it himself

ZEUS

Madness and superstition The why

What matters is -- I need your

through everything

The effect goes beyond the islands wreckage it is
creating gigantic waves and howling wind --

AT THE BEACH - LUCIAN AND ZEUS

The beach shakes from this gigantic quake -- Zeus is thrown
to the deck Lucian is thrown to the ground --

- and one of the invisible fingers moves through the
beach digging a fissure between them --

Lucian is dragged into the fissure and is exrushed by the
travelling force --

determined than before He may still question his own destiny

sits on on the crest of the mountain Gated walls surround
the huge house and its enormous grounds Many wagons are

parked outside and the local wealthy crowd is there for a
feast

ON THE WINDING ROAD - A WAGON SLOWLY APPROACHES
but it is taking a wobbling path Zeus is a little nervous

about this so close to the edge of the mountain path -- he
takes the reins and stops the wagon

ZEUS
Perhaps I should drive Dionysus
Dionysus almost objects but he moves over -- Zeus takes the
reins
DIONYSUS

As you wish The gatemen are
mercurial bastards Once I arrived
with more wine in my belly than in
my cart and they made me enter
through the rear labyrinth It
took me three hours and four
bottles to find my way through

They approach the front gate of the mansion and the gatemen
wave them through Zeus steers the wagon - which is carrying
barrels of wine and ouzo -- toward the mansion itself

The wagon stops and Zeus gets off

ZEUS
Thank you for bringing me through
Dionysus I am in your debt

DIONYSUS
For gaining entry to a feast
Think nothing of it But you must
tell me Why are you so determined
to reach this spot

Zeus pauses a moment Tries to think of the least crazy
version of the truth He draws the “rose” symbol in the dirt
with a staff

ZEUS
I seek the woman who bears this
mark on her skin

Dionysus looks at him blankly -- you dont want to upset a
crazy -- and he almost smiles
DIONYSUS

When I met you in the port I knew
we would be friends Such talk
makes me seem sober

Your debt to me will be dug deeper
still Consider my eyes to be
yours

split up Zeus subtly checks out the women craning his neck
to see if any of them have the birthmark Dionysus is
assisting Zeus by checking women out moving in
uncomfortably close -- which is tricky since most of them
recoil when he comes by Some of the women laugh at Zeus
staring some wouldnt mind a closer look but none of them
seem interested in Dionysus -- its like the difference
between being ogled by Tom Waits or Tom Cruise

As Zeus moves through the crowd we hear bits of
conversation --

GREEK MAN 1
(a bit nervously)
The demons have already struck
Neopolis A village of two hundred
became a slaughterhouse
overnight --

GREEK MAN 2

Iil tell you what you should have
told the fool who spun that tale
Shut up and have another ouzo

(20s) with amazingly long flowing hair approaches Zeus with
a flirtatious smile

Dont say it Do not say that

is still pitching woo turning Zeus face back towards her

GREEK WOMAN
She always wins -- so lets find
something elise to do Gregos If
that is your real name

She takes his hand and places it on her shoulder Zeus

smiles -- hes getting distracted from the job
GREEK WOMAN
Dont you feel a spark -- some

electricity between us

There is actually a small crackle from Zeus hand -- he takes
it away with some regret

ZEUS
Wrong kind

Zeus walks outside -- and the Greek woman pouts her hair
blowing in the wind as she is rejoined by her friend

GREEK WOMAN 2
Hell get nowhere with Astrea and
hell be back in ten minutes
Dont let it worry you Medusa

EXT RACING TRACK - DAY - ZEUS WALKS THROUGH SPECTATORS

who are gathering behind the lines of the racetrack The
competitors line up -- there are three men on horseback
whove come to challenge Astrea Nobody here knows it but
these games are the precursors to the Olympics

The STARTER drops a flag and the race begins All four
horses pound the stone track --

-- and Astrea pulls out half a length ahead widening her
lead until theyve gone around three times All the horses
are fast all the riders are skilled -- but Astrea wins
easily and trots the horse around enjoying the CHEERS of
the crowd

ZEUS

smiles and makes his way through the spectators to talk to
her If there ever was a goddess on earth shes it But as
Zeus walks over a shadow falls over the track --

Zeus looks up and so do the spectators -
IN THE SKY - A HUGE BLACK CLOUD CROSSES THE SUN

but it doesnt look like one in nature It locks onto the
sun and it inverts collapsing in on itself until the sun

is blotted out --

DARKNESS FALLS ON THE CROWD

as noon becomes midnight and their cheering turns to
startled silence -- followed by frightened murmurs -- the
evil has come here -- this is how it began in Thrace --

- and the gasps and whispers of uncertain fear turn to the
terror and screaming of danger confirmed --

ZEUS PULLS OUT HIS SWORD

and looks up -- and his weapon is small comfort because --

IN THE SKY - DEMONS POUR OUT OF THE DARK PASSAGE

as if theyre coming from another plane of reality - theyre
hard to see in the darkness except for one thing --

-- their bodies are fringed in pinpoints of green flame --
there are three of them flying down toward the crowd and
the closer they get the more detail you can see theyre

fifteen feet tall they have taloned hands and feet and odd
quills in their sides -- these shoot out jets of green flame

TIGHT ON ZEUS STUNNED FACE

His expression tells us hes thinking the Ancient Greek
equivalent of holy shit -- up to this point hes seen a
couple of bizarre events but this is his first look at
actual monsters -- and its as shocking to him as it would be
to you or me

THE CROWD PANICS AND RUNS - THE GREEK MAN

we saw before who reported the news of a massacre knows the
name of these demons --

GREEK MAN 1
May the Gods save us -- theyre

pyrrhotaurs
He runs and gets about six steps before a low flying
pyrrhotaur swoops over him -- and its ills jet out
pinpoints of flame that converge and consume him instantly
ZEUS RUNS AGAINST THE STAMPEDE OF SPECTATORS
trying to leave -- hes trying to get to Astrea who is now
off her horse He gets onto the track twenty yards away from
her and shouts -

ZEUS
Theyve come for you We must

leave now

Astrea looks afraid but determined to survive -- she hears
Zeus and pounds track to get to him --

- but a pytrhotaur swoops low over the track -- it is
gaining on trea -—
ZEUS RAISES HIS SWORD

-- no way that demon is going to get her no way --

-- Zeus hurls his sword toward the demons chest --

24

THE PYRRHOTAUR EASILY SWATS THE SWORD AWAY

with a taloned hand -- and as it flies low over Astrea --

-- its firequiils jet out flame towards her -- the pinpoints
of flame dont move straight they zip and loop toward her
like guided missiles --

the flames converge and hit her in the back -- she is
consumed instantly five steps in front of Zeus —--

-- within a split second she is incinerated --

-- Zeus is horrified -- the woman he was to protect is gone
his best efforts not even close to good enough --

-- and as Astrea‘s burnt out husk falls to the ground he
sees this iseven worse than he thought --

-- the jets of green flame flow out of the mouth and eyes of
her skull and converge into a fireball -- they swarm like
fireflies they rejoin and rocket toward Zeus --

-- the fire is sentient

Zeus is powerless to do anything -- but instead of hitting
him the fireball tears off in pursuit of a woman striking
her and incinerating her

Zeus runs -- he picks up his sword and tries to swipe at
pyrrhotaurs who fly low but he cant hit them Zeus runs for
cover toward the stables --

- and we see the pyrrhotaurs are flying around trying to
corral the crowd They arent sparing the men -- but they are
definitely trying to kill the women there Theyre going to
kill all of them to find the one they came for

The crowd shoves into the house and those whove made it
inside find at least short-lived shelter -- the pyrrhotaurs

cant burn through stone -- but they are blasting fire all
over the place

AT THE STABLE - ZEUS LEAPS TO TRY TO KILL A PYRRHOTAUR

but he misses - as the pyrrhotaur loops around Zeus ducks
into the stable for very momentary cover

Panting Zeus looks anguished not because hes probably
going to die Hes miserable because hes blown it

In the stable there is a single horse WHINNYING in terror
at all the noise Zeus looks over and sees --

ELMA - THE STABLE GIRL

we saw before She has her hand on the horses head and her
touch calms the horse instantly She does not look like a
goddess at all -- her clothes are dusty rags not even as
nice as the horses saddle blankets and her face is plain

zeus stumbles over to her wondering if it could be true --

ZEUS
Whats your name girl
she doesnt answer)
Your name --

ELMA
Elma -
(scared annoyed)
I have to tend this horse and find
the others you must leave --

Zeus grabs her arm -- she is shocked at this and probably
thinks Zeus is here to attack her She struggles and Zeus
tears open a sleeve -- revealing the rose birthmark

ZEUS
No We must leave Your name is
Hera -- and I came here for you
(motions outside)
So have the pyrrhotaurs

Elma is stunned She cant believe it Shes never been of
importance to anyone outside this stable But even if she
cant accept it yet we will now

This is Hera

PYRRHOTAUR POV - HIGH ABOVE THE STABLE

A pyrrhotaur flies down low jetting out flame --
INSIDE THE STABLE - FIREFLIES BORE THROUGH THE WOOD

and are blazing through -- in moments theyll be inside

Hera as well now call her jumps onto the back of the horse
and turns to Zeus

HERA
Get on
he starts to in
front)
Behind me I taught Astrea
everything she knew but not
everything I know

Zeus jumps on behind her as the fireflies burn inte the
stable -

HERA
(bending to horse)
Ride Pegasus - now --

-- a few sparking fireflies swarm toward Hera -- several
flit over her birthmark -- and they all head toward her --

-- but as Hera urges the horse on they crash through the
stable door -- Zeus slams the door shut behind them and drops
a locking beam across it --

-- the swarming fire is stopped momentarily by the wood
ABOVE THE STABLE - THE PYRRHOTAUR IS WATCHING

as the horse carrying Hera and Zeus races out -- the

fireflies dont swarm after them though they race back up
toward the pyrrhotaur -

-- the fire surges back into the pyrrhotaur -- and a look of
recognition fiits over its brow Now 1t knows what the fire
has learned that this girl is the one they came for

The pyrrhotaur brays loud and shrill --

AT THE HOUSE - THE TWO OTHER PYRRHOTAURS CIRCLING OVER

are hurling fire down at the terrified people crowded inside

burning away their shelter bit by bit But as they hear the
other one yelling in pyrrhotaurese they fly away -

-- the good news is these bystanders have been spared The
bad news is the Pyrrhotaurs are all going for Zeus and Hera
now

ZEUS AND HERA RIDE TOWARD THE GATE

and the winding road thats the only exit -- but a pyrrhotaur
flies toward and perches on the gate

Hera wheels her horse around -- it races away from the gate

and back into the grounds The pyrrhotaur launches from the
gate flying after them

Zeus looks at the pyrrhotaur gaining fast and turns to
Hera -

ZEUS
Take us to that wagon as close as
you can

HERA
Thats not the way out --
ZEUS
Do it or we wont reach the way

out
HERA STEERS THE HORSE THROUGH THE WRECKAGE

of overturned tables and carts toward Dionysus’ wagon -- the
pyrrhotaur is coming up close --

UNDER THE WAGON - DIONYSUS IS DRAINING A BOTTLE DRY

with his eyes shut -- and its not the first hes had since
the attack began Hes terrified and hes dealing by trying
to convince himself its all in his head

DIONYSUS
(eyes firmly shut)
Fire bleeding dragons --
preposterous Too much coriander
in the ouzo -- thats it They
should be gone by now I can look
by now certainly --

The pile of empties by him rattles -- hoofbeats are drawing
closer Dionysus draws up his Courage and pries open his
eyes for a squint --

DIONYSUS POV - THE HORSE IS THUNDERING TOWARD HIM

and the pyrrhotaur is flying just behind - on the horse
Zeus is bending down to swing his sword at the wagon --

DIONYSYS SCRAMBLES OUT FROM UNDER THE WAGON

and runs -- tonight the bottle let him down

THE PYRRHOTAUR IS DIRECTLY ABOVE ZEUS AND HERA

and its firequills jet out a thousand points of flame -- the
flame shoots down toward them but -—-

AS THEY PASS THE WAGON - ZEUS SLASHES THE WAGON WHEELS

on one side -- the wagon collapses and the barrels stacked
on it roll and bounce off --

-- Many of the fireflies burn into a cask of wine they
extinguish with pops and sparks -

and the rest of the “fireflies” hit another bouncing cask

but this one contains ouzo -- the barrel ignites and
explodes setting off several others ina fage blast --
- and this BLAST disorients the pyrrhotaur sending it
crashing toward Zeus and Hera

Zeus swings around and decapitates the demon -- it crashes to
the ground in a heap of green and orange flame as Zeus and
Hera race into the grounds

Theres no break for them though as the other two
pyzrhotaurs launch after them -- the wind from their flapping
wings fans the ames amid the wreckage on the ground
ZEUS
Is there another way out of here

HERA
Yes We have to make a couple of
turns first

Zeus looks ahead to where shes steering -- and he cant
believe where shes going

ZEUS

You may be the goddess of

understatement
HIGH ANGLE - HERA IS RACING TOWARD THE LABYRINTH
which is a hell of a lot more than a “couple of turns” This
ornate outdoor maze usually just a way to pass the time for
the idle rich now is their only way out
The last two pyrrhotaurs fly into view --
ZEUS AND HERA RIDE INTO THE LABYRINTH
and get some very temporary cover the labyrinth is covered
by wooden trellises and vines and the walltops are decorated
by statues of gods and monsters held in place by ironwork

THE OTHER PYRRHOTAUR FLIES OVER THE LABYRINTH

and cant see much through the trellis and vinework on top
but thats easy to fix --

-- the pyrrhotaur jets out two firebursts -- the flame splits
in two racing along the trellis to burn it all away

FIREBALL POV - SIZZLING ALONG THE TRELLIS

zigging and zagging sometimes with a glimpse of their quarry
below sometimes not --

IN THE LABYRINTH - HERA RIDES THE HORSE

as fast as she dares racing it from one turn to another and
even if they werent being chased it would dangerous enough
to try to race a horse through all these turns --

HERA
-- the flames are pursuing us

ZEUS

The fire is guided by a mind of
its own --

Hera knows the maze -- she swerves the horse through turn
after turn --

FIREBALL POV - THE FLAMES BURN THROUGH THE TRELLIS
and drop down -- but theyre too late Hera and Zeus have
made another turn The fireball pursues them -- but makes a
wrong turn and is caught in a dead end The fireball pauses
visibly confused -- its intelligent enough for a chase
but maybe not for a maze
ZEUS AND HERA RACE AWAY THROUGH A STRAIGHT SECTION
and Zeus smiles --
ZEUS

- though apparently not a very

keen mind
The smile is wiped off Zeus face as a rxrhotaur bursts
through the trellis ceiling a few yards ciead of them
The pyrrhotaurs fringes of flame are the brightest light in
this darkness --

The horse rears and backs up -- Hera is terrified --

and without a word Zeus gets off the horse and leaves --
he climbs up a fixture and through the open ceiling

HERA
Dont leave me

No answer from Zeus And no sound in the labyrinth but the
pyrrhotaurs raspy breathing and the crackling of its
flamequills as it steps toward Hera

The terrified horse backs into a dead end -- and the
pyrrhotaur steps to the entrance It knows the game is over

It raises its wings high so it can use its flamequills with
no obstruction --

-- but before it can fire Zeus sword sticks in the
pyrrhotaurs wingtip

Zeus is crouched atop the labyrinth wall -- with all his
might he pulls the sword up
The pyrrhotaur BRAYS in pain and anger -- this hurts but it

is certainly not a mortal wound It swings up out of the maze
and onto the top of the wall --

-- facing Zeus This was the plan But his face tells us he
didnt have anything figured out beyond this

ZEUS
(shouts to Hera)
Ride on Ill meet you on the
other side of the labyrinth
(to himself)
Or perhaps the other side of the
underworld

The pyrrhotaur ROARS at Zeus who is holding his sword in a
defensive commanding coverofa-Robert-E-Howard-paperback

pose -- and he decides to try this out
ZEUS
(full bass hero
voice)

Dare you attack a god Begone
demon or taste the wrath of Zeus

Yup the pyrrhotaur dares -- with a swipe of histalon Zeus
sword goes flying back against another statue so hard that
the swords blade cracks Zeus bluster evaporates He
clumsily rolls back almost falling back into the maze and
scrambles behind a statue of a monster--

-- and even that is no shelter -- the pyrrhotaurs talon rips

through the statue just inches above Zeus’ head
IN THE LABYRINTH - HERA RIDES FURIOUSLY

to get through this dark maze as the pyrrhotaurs SCREECHES
echo throughout the maze -- where is it

THE PYRRHOTAUR STALKS ZEUS ATOP THE LABYRINTH WALL

and it is a terrifying figure fifteen feet tall fringed in
points of fire and easily able to leap across gaps while
Zeus scrambles back on the wall The only possible cover are
statues scattered around the walltops heid in place by
ironwork Zeus ducks behind another statue which is razed in
half and toppled by the pyrrhotaur --

and Zeus is exposed now There is nowhere for him to go
nothing for him to do but gape up at the pyrrhotaur which

moves over the jagged edge of the statue It is about to
swipe him with the talon --

-- and Zeus sees a way Directly above the pyrrhotaurs head
is a section of ironwork torn loose by the strike --

-- and Zeus jumps directly into the rrhotaurs face
reaching behind its head to get the bent iron bar —-

-- Zeus pulls the bar down behind the pyrrhotaurs neck
thrusting its chest onto the sharp edge of the statue it
stroyed

The broken statues point lances into the pyrrhotaurs
chest --

The pyrrhotaur flails and struggles howling madly -- its
firequills shoot out streaks o lame at head eve here
but that don’t join into a fireball -—

-- and Zeus struggles with all his might pulling the
pyrrhotaur down so that its hissing snarling snapping face
is an inch from his -- its talons try to reach around the
statue but cant quite grasp him --

and with one final pull the pyrrhotaur dies -- and the
fire in its flamequills go out quill by quill

ELSEWHERE IN THE LABYRINTH HERA RIDES ON

as guickly as she can - but the last pyrrhotaur flies into
the maze too directly behind her --

-- and shes driven into a cul-de-sac No way out -- and the
pyrrotaur lands and advances

ZEUS RUNS ALONG THE LABYRINTH TOP

as he hears Hera SCREAM Where in the maze is she He looks
down and sees only embers of burnt trellis --

-- until several turns away he sees the point of a
pyrrhotaur wing over the wall --

-- Zeus instinctively desperately reaches out and doesnt
even know what he’s about to unleash --

CLOSE ON ZEUS EYE - HIS CAPILLARIES CHANGE

from red veins to electical charges --

A DOUBLE LIGHTNING STRIKE IS SUMMONED FROM THE SKIES

and it strikes the labyrinth walls by the pyrrhotaur --

INSIDE THE LABYRINTH - THE PYRROTAUR

isnt directly hit but its knocked back as THUNDER ECHOES
through the walls -- and where the lightning struck the
walls cave in on top of the pyrrhotaur --

-- the entire section of labyrinth is becoming unstable and
could cave in on Hera -- sections behind her are cracking --

-- so Hera kicks the horse forward -- it rides up the
wreckage covering the rrhotaur -- the pyrrhotaur reaches up
through the wreckage for the horses egs but misses --

HERA RIDES THE HORSE UP ALONG THE WALL OF THE MAZE

and gallops toward the edge -- keeping the horse on a thirty
inch track is tough enough but the walls are cracking -- she

has to push the horse to leap over the gaps Meanwhile -

ZEUS RUNS ALONG THE DAMAGED WALL

and tries to avoid the cave-ins as he heads toward the edge --
THE LAST PYRRHOTAUR IS HALF BURIED BY WRECKAGE

and more slabs of wall are tumbling down on it - but it
Manages to ooze out jets of green flame that take off --

ATOP THE WALLS - ZEUS LEAPS OFF A COLLAPSING SECTION

of wall but reaches a corner that Hera is riding toward --
as the horse comes up Zeus leaps back on and Hera drives
the horse toward a corner so they can climb down a ramp

But as soon as theyre reunited a green fireball emerges --
it tracks toward Zeus and Hera and it obviously has a strong
advantage the horse has to zig zag along the top of the

walls but the fireball simply takes the straightest
shortest interception path it can

The fireball is xight behind them and gaining --

The horse is cut off from the ramp in the corner and is
driven toward a steep drop on the wall -
Hera urgently whispers to the horse --

HERA
-- fly Pegasus -- fly -

The green fireball has overtaken them -- but as it does --
IN THE LABYRINTH - THE PYRRHOTAUR IS STRUGGLING

under the weight of the collapsed wall -- and it finally
stops moving -- it is dead

ATOP THE WALL - THE GREEN FIREBALL OVERTAKES HERA AND ZEUS
but as the pyrrhotaur dies so does its fire -- the fireball

breaks up into fireflies that wink out like the aftermath
of a fireworks display --

The horse leaps off the wall -- its almost twenty feet up
but the leap goes on as if the horse were actually flying
or held up by magic

CLOSE ON HERA

She didnt know she could do this -- but it is clearly
happening because of her

THE HORSE LOWERS TO THE EARTH

and literally hits the ground running taking Zeus and Hera
into the woods

DISSOLVE TO
EXT GREEK COUNTRYSIDE - DAY - AT A TEMPLE AND POND - HERA

is bent before the pond cleaning herself as best she can

She looks down at her reflection and sees what she always

sees a plain unattractive girl She tries to do something
with her hair and it doesnt help She simply gives up

They are in the middle of nowhere the only thing around is

a huge temple in a clearing Hera walks to where Zeus

stands -- he is looking off to the mountains in the distance
HERA

I thank you for helping me escape
But I cannot believe what youve
told me about my birthmark The
only true gods are the Titans

HERA
(insistent)
I must return My duty is to help
the other servants rebuild the
house

ZEUS
(sadly)
Your only duty now is to yourself

Hera looks out into the distance and sees what Zeus sees
FAR OFF OVER THE MOUNTAINS - A SULFUROUS DARK CLOUD

has gathered over the settlement they came from The clouds
bulge and slowly rain begins to fall --

-- but the rain is not water We see it first as dots of
red - and as the rain really breaks the sky is filled with
a column of fire that annihilates the entire area

ON ZEUS AND HERA

Zeus is saddened Its the second time he’s seen such a
massacre But Hera is terrified She is religious and here
undeniably is the wrath of the gods Hera runs into the
temple

INSIDE THE TEMPLE - GIGANTIC STATUES OF THE TITANS

are there Cronus Rhea and others towering two hundred
feet high Quivering with fear Hera throws herself at the
enormous feet of the Cronus statue --

HERA
Mighty Cronus hear my prayer --
end your wrath and show mercy to
your subjects -

Zeus enters standing behind her

ZEUS
Get up

HERA
(ignoring him)
We will pay any tribute you wish --

ZEUS
Except our dignity so stand up --

Zeus roughly angrily pulls her to her feet

ZEUS

Tell me How did this temple get
built This enormous temple in the
middle of nowhere one of hundreds
like it

(contemptuous)
The Titans sent plagues monsters
and destruction to these lands --
correct And to make them stop
the people took everything --
absolutely everything they had to
build this temple -- to worship
the Titans to appease them but
most of all to make them stop
Children went hungry and lives
were destroyed to build this
temple -- so certainly the Titans
showed mercy to their subjects
Didnt they

(she doesnt answer)
They didnt The Titans ignored
every tribute and sacrifice and
continued to torment these
people -- until their village was
gone leaving nothing but this
temple behind So tell me this --
why would you - why would
anyone -- bend and bow and pray to
these murdering bastards

Hera is rocked back by this --

HERA
You speak blasphemy --

ZEUS

Eagerly All my life and with all
my heart But youve inspired me
I will worship after all

(to statue)
O mighty Cronus hear my prayer --
may all of mankind learn to revile
you rather than worship you

Hera recoils from Zeus and Zeus defiantly stares up up
at the face of the statue of Cronus his words echoing --

ZEUS
May all the anguish and horror
youve sent to us be returned to
you a thousand times over --

The statue shudders and creaks -- but Zeus goes on louder
and angrier --

ZEUS
-- and may the death youve earned
be equally agonizing and eternal

Something is going on within the statue -- is it going to
start moving

HERA BACKS AWAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TEMPLE
and shes shaken by all this - she looks back --
THE CRONUS STATUE BEGINS TO MOVE

but before anything can happen Zeus anger involuntarily

lets loose a bolt of lightning which strikes the statue -- it
is blown to pieces

Zeus backs away from the statue as mammoth pieces of it fall
down -- the hands and the head almost Crush him -- but Zeus
walks away from the wreckage still wound up and angry as he
approaches Hera

ZEUS
That is the only kind of prayer
that the Titans will understand

Hera moves away from him and to the door looking back at her
distant burning home

RERA
I was born on those grounds I
never travelled beyond the marble
walls It was magnificent It was
my whole world and I thought it
would stand a thousand years

(beat)
Now it is nothing but smoke and
ashes
ZEUS

I know your fears and I share
them My home is gone too My
family and everyone Ive ever
known has been taken from me
(beat)
We both have been forced to accept
things we couldnt imagine before
I never believed in any hidden
power -- any force that you
couldnt see or feel or hear or
touch

ZEUS
I never believed in the Titans or
the gods -- and I certainly didnt

believe the old mans claim that
I was destined to become one of
them I still cant But hour by
hour everything I see and
encounter is proving his story
right and my doubts wrong

(beat)
If you truly want to help other
people there is only one course
of action and it is not prayer
We must find the others who bear
the mark Perhaps just to warn
them -- but perhaps if the story
is true together we can make a
difference

(beat)
You are a servant no more Every
choice you make in your life is
now your own Will you help me

Hera looks up at Zeus Shes been a servant all her life --
and Zeus is showing her more respect than shes ever known

HERA
I have never heard those words as
a request only as a command

And I have always wanted to see
the world that lay beyond those
walis

(beat)
Lets find the others

Hera manages a small smile She is scared and uncertain -
but she will go with Zeus to find the others

CHLOE (AKA DEMETER) is happy with the result She moves the pot to a spot on the
table where the sun will dry the painting -- and she picks up
another pot very carefully wrapping it in cloth

Chloe is working in a simple but comfortable room The decor
is lower-middle class Dark Ages There isnt a lot of
furniture and the few comforts here are crude and homemade
We will note however that the house has an uncommonly
beautiful garden that’s a huge contrast to the simple home

We must fight this evil at the
source while our strength remains

DOWN THE BLOCK - CHLOE COMES OUT OF THE BUILDING

toward a horse and wagon She is about to take the horse but
is stopped by her father HYPAIKOS Hes around forty but he
looks more like sixty -- a lifetime of hard work and hard
conditions have bent his back and broken his spirit

HYPAIKOS
Chloe I need the wagon today

Chloe stops This and the look on his face tells her
something

CHLOE
Demons Again

HYPAIKOS
They ripped through six homes last
night I have to pick up whats
left and prepare them for ceremony
before the dogs claim them

CHLOE
Let me help you father -

HYPAIKOS
No Chloe This is no work for a
young girl And don’t go to the
necropolis today Stay home

HYPAIKOS
(wearily)
At the rate the demons are going
our entire village will itself
become a necropolis soon

Hypaikos rides off with the wagon Chloe is sorry to hear of
the fresh attack -- but shes still going She shoulders her
pack and starts walking down the road

As she does we can see there is evidence of demonic attacks
everywhere - some buildings are burnt some partially
collapsed Chloe heads out of the village as we --

DISSOLVE TO
EXT NECROPOLIS - LATE AFTERNOON - AT A GATED ENTRANCE

Chloe enters stepping into the resting place of the dead By
the entrance are the most honored spots for the dead There
are burial mounds and markers for those killed in battle
There are huge marble tombs with elaborate decorations for
those who died with money

Chice steps past those She didnt come for them She walks
toward the budget area where a hill dips down toward some
natural stone corridors The corridors have berths carved
into them allowing the dead to be stacked three compartments
high in a wall There are open berths waiting to be

filled -- and ones that hold bodies covered over by stone
slabs Some of them are cared for with markings and plants
Some are simply barren

The barren ones are Chioes concern She stops at one of the
lonelier budget crypts with no remembrance there -- and she
puts down the terracotta pot she was painting of a woman
playing with a child As she respectfully places it --

- we take a look through the stone corridor and see that

there are at least two dozen of her decorated pots lain in
front of otherwise untended crypts

Chloe takes the wrapped bundle she was carrying and walks
back to the edge of the stone corridors where this graveyard
ends She looks out at the woods certain shes being watched

CHLOE
You can come out now Im not
afraid of you You shouldnt be
afraid of me

as she puts down the wrapped bundle

CHLOE
All right Maybe next time

Chioe walks away -- and only after we hear the CREAK of the
gate closing do we see

MYLES (AKA HADES) EMERGES FROM HIS HIDING PLACE

He is a pale haunted but decidedly human boy He untwines

the wrapping from the package revealing a pot thats been
decorated with an etching of a boy and his dog

Remote as this is this is his first human contact in a very
long time Myles almost grins

MYLES
Look Cerberus -- she included you
as well

With an oddly whistling WOOF a dog comes bounding out --

-- this is CERBERUS a typically perky frisky dog He is
untypical in that he is recently but clearly dead The
whistle in his woof comes from the fact that there are holes
rotted in his flesh - bits of fur even fly off his wagging
tailbone

Until she sees a group approaching with a wagon They are not

carrying any dead but death is clearly on their minds

This is the proverbial angry mob led by Dimitrios the
rabble rouser from a few scenes back
4h

DIMITRIOS
Go home Chloe This is not for
you to see

CHLOE
What are you doing

DIMITRIOS

I think you know He speaks to the
dead When we came for him the
last time in the town we killed
his hound -- and he brought it
back to life in front of us

louder now)
When that happened the evil came

The NOISY MOB seconds that emotion -- in between SHOUTS of
agreement they get out their weapons Battered swords bows
and arrows -- certainly enough to grease a teenage boy

CHLOE
I dont know why the demons have
come for our town but hes
harmless -- hes hiding here
because hes afraid of you --

Dimitrios and the others shove past her

IN THE EDGE OF THE NECROPOLIS - MYLES RESTS

in the furthest bier from the entrance -- this is his home
His only belongings are a pile of scroils a plate and a
spoon and now this decorated pot going into an honored
corner Myles doesnt know whats coming --

AT THE NECROPOLIS ENTRANCE THE MOB IS ALMOST THERE

and the CAMERA EASES PAST them into the necropolis our view
floating on a breeze --

- the breeze passes cyrpts and graves and pleading urgent
voices leap onto the wind like aural passengers --

-- Myles
-- “you must leave now Myles --
-- “youre in danger Myles please --

- more voices male and female young and old layer onto
the wind until its a swirl of sound --

and the wind reaches Myles at the end of the necropolis -
suddenly the chorus of the dead goes directly into his head --

- and Myles leaps to his feet not because hes heeding the
warning but because hes miserable --

MYLES
(shouting)
- stop it -- youre not real --

But the voices persist as Myles runs down the necropolis
path -- you must protect yourself -- you are our king --

MYLES
- I am no ones king

Cerberus runs after Myles concerned about his master --

-- and Myles run ends and his hands come off his ears when
he sees Dimitrios and the mob with their swords out

DIMITRIOS
Do you see Do you see the dog

Cerberus hides behind a tree not quite understanding why
theyre mad -- his eyes are hollow but his expression is the
one your dog has when its caught whizzing on the carpet

DIMITRIOS
Can there be any doubt hes allied
with the dead
off SHOUTS of
agreement)
Then leave no pieces of either of
them to put back together

The others brandish their swords -- and Myles stiffens There
is nowhere for him to run

But in a split second of silence the only SOUND other than
bows creaking back rolls down the path --

-- at least a dozen obolos -- death coins - roll down the
stone path and tinkle to a stop because —--

THE CORPSES HAVE RISEN FROM THIER BIERS

and are moving toward Myles to protect him -- some stiffly
some smoothly depending on how recently dead they are --

- and between Myles and the posse the ground cracks and
opens - the well tended graves and tombs of soldiers bring
out the dead --

-- and they advance against the mob The swords of the dead
sweep away those of the mob --

A GROUP OF CORPSES FORM A PROTECTIVE CIRCLE AROUND MYLES

and they clearly revere him -- the ones that have enough of
a face for detectible expressions are smiling the ones that
arent are saying over and over “protect the king -- “you

are safe with us my lord —-

-- and Myles is as terrified or repulsed as you or I would
be Hed push them away if he could stand to touch them

MYLES
No -- get away from me I am not
your king -- or your lord

FURTHER BACK IN THE NECROPOLIS THE VILLAGE MOB

that was eager to carve up a teenage boy is now cowering
behind some statuary staring in disbelief --

A HUGE DEAD SOLDIER IS SPINNING AROUND A BROADSWORD

with amazing skill -- hes got more military decorations than
flesh but he could clearly take on ali of the mob himself

BEHIND THE STATUARY - ONE OF THE MOB DRAWS AN ARROW

and pulis the bowstring back his hands shaking -- but the
arrow flies out --

- the dead soldier is hit in the arm and the arrow chips the
bone to powder - the dead soldier almost drops his sword A
weakness has been found

DIMITRIOS
Stay back Use only your arrows

The mob takes heart and fights back -- maybe this can be done

ARROWS FLY THROUGH THE NECROPOLIS

and the first wave of the barrage is aimed at the few dead
soldiers -- the oldest corpses are the most vulnerable they
break like chalk and fall to dust but even the newer corpses
cant win in long range battle

THE SHIELD CORPSES TIGHTEN THEIR CIRCLE AROUND MYLES

but the arrows are striking here too -- the corpses are blown
apart by the arrows spraying bone dust and rotten oozing
flesh against Myles His protection is almost gone

One BOWMAN lets an arrow fly -- it pins Cerberus to the tree
An ordinary dog would be killed - Cerberus just whines in
discomfort
44

AT THE GATE - CHLOE RUNS IN BEHIND THE ARCHERS

and she sees that theyre about to let fly this time
undoubtedly taking Myles Chloe grabs Dimitrios’ arm --

CHLOE
- stop it Leave him alone

Dimitrios throws her to the ground and is ready to pull --
-- Chioe lands sprawled in the dirt screaming --

CHLOE
- dont --

And as she yells her hands in the dirt -- vines and roots

race from her fingers and toward Dimitrios ——

- the vines and roots spiral around Dimitrios legs and

chest lashing around his arm —-- Dimitrios’ arrow goes wild
nowhere near Myles

Gasping Chloe looks at the ground and her hands -- she
pulls them up in shock What she’s seen what she feels -- is
impossible

Chloe staggers to her feet grabbing the ivy covered earthen
wall of a necropolis corridor - leaning weakly against the
wall she cant see that an archer is now aiming at her --

- but with her touch the ivy slithers along the wall like
tentacles - one vine snatches away a bow and snaps it in
half --

-- and thats the limit for the mob they didnt sign on
for anything like this The archers run out stumbling over
the rocks and each other --

- one of them falls to the ground and he is immediately
covered in i -- if you think that doesnt sound scary
well consider this its tearing down his throat into his
ears and nostrils and tightening around his limbs with
enough force to almost shatter his bones -— his SCREAM is
MUFFLED by the vines -—

-- but Chloe hears it and raises her head -- she sees the
horror of whats happened and that its coming out of her --
she takes her hands off the wall and its like pulling out
the plug The vines drop and the ivy choking the archer goes
limp He staggers to his feet weak and coughing tearing the
ivy off and he casts a frightened look back at Chloe

Chloe looks at her hands terrified of what shes done As --

THE CORPSES AROUND MYLES COLLAPSE LIKE PUPPETS

because the threat has gone -- the voices whisper our king
is saved in the wind as they fall away in a heap of bones
surrounding Myles

Then its as quiet as a cemetary should be Myles and Chloe
gape at other neither knowing how this is possible

ZEUS (0S)
I dont believe it either But
maybe I can explain it

Myles and Chloe look up and see --
AT THE NECROPOLIS GATE ZEUS AND HERA ARE THERE

with horses and a wagon Zeus is holding the chart which
bears their true names

ZEUS
Your name is Hades And your name
is Demeter

EXT WILDERNESS ROAD - NIGHT - ZEUS HERA HADES and DEMETER

are riding out of town with Cerberus trotting alongside
them Hades is agitated and Zeus face shows hes irritated
with him already

HADES

So let me understand this
According to you you are the god
of gods supreme of supremes

(beat)
Ive heard better stories Can you
tell me why for example the man
who set you off on this hunt was
a little vague on this fire of
the sky” business I mean why
didn’t he just come right out and
Say what would destroy Cronus

ZEUS
Listen --
HADES
I wouldve told you up front You
seem like someone who needs very
simple very clear directions so
I wouldnt have waited until my
throat was collapsing to dust
before giving you the single most
important piece of information
that the fate of the entire
universe might rest on --

ZEUS
(finally interrupting)
Listen -- I only came to warn you

You dont have to believe it I
still cant

HADES

Oh I think you do believe it
Zeus You seem like the type who
would eagerly embrace the news
that lightning bolts shoot out of
your ass I know more about these
prophecies than you do I promise
you

(points to scrolls in

his pack)
One of the better educated
residents of the necropolis wanted
to be entombed with his scrolls --
and since his eyes rotted out
decades ago he kindly allowed me
to borrow them They’re not the
childrens versions of the Titans
story you know -- theyre direct
transcriptions of the words of the
fabled seer Mykalos So I know
what these names are supposed to
mean You tell me that I am
Hades -- the Lord of the Damned

(beat)
Here are my options If youre
wrong youre no god of gods
youre the maddest of the mad If
I go with you and youre rightIm
going to be wrestling one eyed
monsters and fleeing from giants
all in the name of reaching this
goal ruling for an eternity over
a world of death

(beat)
I dont want that job Would you
Im a little short on reasons for
following you

ZEUS
(annoyed)
Then dont let me keep you from a
greater destiny Go back to that
necropolis read legends instead
of living them and wrestle with
your own one-eyed monster --

HERA
Theres someone coming

Hades and Zeus stop arguing and see a torch and a horsedrawn
wagon coming down the road Is this trouble --

Demeter gets off her horse

DEMETER
Wait here Ill be back ina
moment

AT THE WAGON - DEMETER WALKS UP TO HER FATHER
who looks worried about her

HYPAIKOS
Chloe -- you live Thank the
gods --

BACK AT THE HORSES - HADES CANT RESIST

HADES
Oh youre welcome It was
nothing really --

HERA
-- be quiet -

AT THE WAGON - DEMETER AND HYPAIKOS

HYPAIKOS
I was so worried when I heard
about the battle here They said
that you --

Hypaikos trails off Doesnt even know how to say it

DEMETER
Its true All of it

RYPATKOS
So you were just going to leave
without saying goodbye to your
father

Hypaikos is hurt by this -- and Chloe is almost in tears
CHLOE
I dont know what else to do Its
ali happened so fast -- I dont

know whats happening to me or
how to control it

(tearful)
But I know I have to leave to find
out

With some hesitation but with finality Hypaikos accepts

this and moves closer for an embrace -- but she pulls away
CHLOE
Stop I dont know if my touch
would -- if --

pulls it together)
I might hurt you father

Hypaikos smiles -- and takes her hand

HYPAIKOS
(softly)
I dont know whats happening
either Chloe But I know you
could never hurt me

Hypaikos embraces Chloe -- and Chloe drops her hesitation
embracing Hypaikos tightly holding desperately onto this
last moment with the best part of her old life

They break off the embrace -- and Chloe looks into her
fathers eyes She smiles through her tears

Her touch did affect him And it proves that what she has
isnt a curse

Hypaikos now looks younger and healthier like a robust
twenty-five year old instead of a broken fifty year old He
doesnt realize yet whats happened

HYPATKOS
Why are you looking at me that way

Chloe shakes her head Shell let him find out later

CHLOE
Goodbye father I love you

Chloe turns and heads back to the horses As she walks back --

ON THE HORSES - A CAPTIVATED HADES IS WATCHING HER

walk back

ZEUS
So you have no reason to join us
(Hades doesnt answer)
Oh lord of bad breath and worse
hearing -- are you coming or not

Hades is watching her get on lost in her beauty But Zeus is
loud enough to break this spell and whip Hades back to his
caustic self

HADES
Yes yes your royal agony -- Ili
come If only to discover if there
really could be a hell worse than
this village

Hades pulls his horse into line as they all ride off Hades
steals looks at Chloe whenever he can For all his bluster
hes clearly coming along because hes in love with her

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE TRIREME SAILS AGAIN - DAY - ZEUS TRIMS THE SAIL

as Hera watches At least in her eyes Zeus cuts a heroic
figure up there -- hes handsome and confident Hera watches
from behind a cabin and almost - almost -- catches his eye
When he looks over she ducks back behind the cabin

Hera looks over her clothes -- still the dingy smelly rags
she wore in the stables The uncertain way she carries
herself tells us this is why she isnt engaging Zeus she
feels like shes not in his league

Hera sees Hades securing his pack full of scrolls on the
deck -- and she walks over

HERA
I heard you talking to Zeus
earlier

HADES

You heard me talking to that
musclehead on the mast Hes a
long way off from earning the name
of Zeus

HERA
What I mean is -- you told him
that these scrolls explain who we
are and what we will become
(uncertain)
Can you teil me who I am

Hades looks at her and picks up on her vulnerability She is
interested in his opinion about this and she is scared about
what the answer will be

HADES
(not unkindly)
No one can tell you that better
than yourself I can only tell you
what a seer wrote long ago
(unpacks scroll)
It says here that the woman
bearing the mark of the rose --
(compares her
birthmark with
scroll)
- is Hera the goddess of beauty

Hera takes this like a slap in the face -- like hes making
a terrible deadpan joke at her expense

HERA
I wanted your help not cheap
mockery

Hera starts to move away but Hades stops her looking
sincere

HADES
Im not joking This says that you
will be the goddess of beauty

Hera scans his face -- and finally believes him She steps

away from Hades and sees a sheet of polished metal on the
boat

Hera examines her face in the slightly distorted reflection
as best she can We can tell -- and ultimately she can too --
that her features have changed slightly Her features are
more delicate her face is more radiant

CLOSE ON HERAS FACE

as she smiles realizing this may be her gift She is growing
more beautiful

Zeus looks down at Hera catches her eye and smiles This
time Hera holds his gaze and smiles back

Hades breaks the spell

HADES
This also says youre to be the
goddess of matrimony
(beat)
Best of luck with that one Excuse
me

Hades walks to another part of the boat where

DEMETER IS PETTING CERBERUS

and the way shes doing it tells us shes not just petting
him -- shes trying to heal him Shes having a little bit of
an effect -- some of his ripped skin seams back together --
yet he still looks like what he is a perky but dead dog

HADES
Can you heal him

DEMETER
I dont know -- this is alli so new
to me

Demeter pets Cerberus again but to no effect Shes clearly
done all she can do for the patchwork pooch

HADES

I want to ask you something

she Looks up)
Why did you come out to the
necropolis all those times

(beat)
I mean I went because when I
started -- hearing the voices and
when I brought Cerberus back --

(with difficuity)
- the people of the village drove
mé out Even my family turned
against me I went to the
necropolis because I had nowhere
else to go

(beat)
I saw you with your father If I
had someone -- anyone --in my

life like that I wouldnt want
the company of corpses

(beat
So why would you

DEMETER
Id been out there scores of
times -- to visit the tomb of my

mother Later my father took the
job of hauling the dead up for
ceremony and I came with him when
hed take my help

(beat)
Each time Id see all the
graves -- some well tended some

decorated some not And that
didnt seem right

(beat)
For all the ones neglected I made
the pots For those who couldnt
afford it I placed an obolos in
the tomb --

HADES
An obolos The death coin to pay
the ferryman to take them to the
underworld
(disbelieving)
Its all a superstition A story

DEMETER
Maybe it is Maybe its real
Either way its only an obolos
(simple)
Someone should speak for the dead
dont you think

Demeter turns to look at the sunset Hades gapes at her
trying to hide it but he is long gone in love with her

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BOAT - ZEUS WATCHES THE SUNSET
but he looks a little pensive Hera joins him

HERA
Is something troubling you

ZEUS

I didnt start on this search
because I believed in what Oranos
said I thought it was nonsense
I set out on my hunt because my
parents were murdered in front of
me and I wanted to find the man
responsible

(beat)
But the further we go and the
more I see the more I have to
believe in what Oranos said

ZEUS
And if I believe that tale -- then
everything in my life is false My
mother was not my mother -- my

father not my father

HERA
Yet -- do you grieve less for
them knowing that
(beat)

Of course not They raised you as
their own because they loved you
Such love is even stronger than
blood Even now the feelings you
carry for them are proof of that
(beat)
We always choose those who we love
most

Zeus watches the sunset comforted a little as we --
DISSOLVE TO
EXT ISLAND - PREDAWN TWILIGHT - A SIGNAL FIRE

is roaring from a high position - it seems pretty big but
a VILLAGER shouts urgently to the few others there --

VILLAGER
More More it must be higher

The others throw on twigs and branches and the villager dips
two torches in the fire - he runs to a higher position in
the rocks and waves them away from him shouting --

VILLAGER
Stay away Do not sail this pass --
As he waves we see a ship is far out on the horizon -- very

far out Theres no chance it will see or hear this signal

Then comes the sound that they hoped would not come An
inhuman earsplitting WAIL from far out echoing everywhere

Fatigued from having seen this too many times the villager
drops his torches The others pour a bucket on the signal
fire quenching it All walk down the inside of the tower in
defeat

There is no longer a ship on the horizon -- but that
horrible unavoidable WAIL continues -- and we get a wider
look of what the villagers are inside --

ACOLLOSSAL STATUE STANDS ASTRIDE THE PORT

The statue -- about the size of the Statue of Liberty -- is
an amazing sight holding a gigantic beacon over its head
But as we MOVE IN through the port passing this symbol of
strength we see nothing but misery

AT A MARKETPLACE NEAR THE DOCKS - DAWN

We can see in a glance that this marketplace is built
entirely around the port But we can also see that it is
devastated Shops are shuttered and people freeze in horror
or despair at the ongoing WAIL Everyone hoped it would
leave This is proof that it has stayed

As we MOVE through a now barren marketplace we see and hear
townspeople desperately begging and bargaining for food --

WOMAN
-- there must be something -- some
figs or olives --

VENDOR
Not for months -- and not til
someone dares sail past the

Serraton

At another table a GRAIN MERCHANT has a virtually empty
wagon -- there is one sack left and hes wringing every
piastre he can from INIGO (50s) a corpulent slave merchant
who looks as if he hasnt missed any meals -- and he is
accompanied by an emaciated SLAVE

GRAIN MERCHANT
This is the last Inigo The price
for this is fifty drachmas

INIGO

Have mercy on an honest
businessman I have had scores of
slaves stuck in this miserable
port for two months -- keeping
them fed is an impossible burden

(motions to slave)
Let me offer you this slave in
payment His back is the strongest
on my ship --

GRAIN MERCHANT
His back is barely holding up his
own tunic and I cant afford to
feed him either
(holds out hand)
Sixty drachmas

Inigo reluctantly digs out the coins -- and the slave takes
the bag Inigo is frustrated and determined This has to end

EXT ONE OF THE PORT DOCKS - A LARGE SLAVE SHIP

is tied up there and it is packed with its human cargo all
chained together through links welded to the the deck

INSIDE THE SHIP THE GALLEY

is the most miserable place on the ship suffocating dark
and brutally hot As we follow a repulsive guard DONOS
(40s) we see the slaves are physically ruined and
spiritually broken All but --

CHRYSSA (AKA HESTIA) who is chained to an oar station She is not only unbroken
there is fire in her eyes and she doesnt seem affected by
the heat She looks up at Donos as he stops

DONOS
Perhaps your mind has changed
Chryssa I can make life very easy
for you -- or very hard You can
tend children in an Athenian
farm -- or I can seil you at a
bargain rate to dig in the
deepest blackest Thracian ore
mine

Something about that last bit bothers her But Chryssa
doesnt want to let Donos see Chryssa looks away
dismissively and defiantly Donos reaches down to gently take
her chin

DONOS
Forty days below decks Time
enough for you to think of the
many many more pleasant tasks you
could perform

Chryssa looks up at Donos with a genuinely smouldering look

CHRYSSA
There is one at least I dreamt
of it very very late at night
my first night here But you must
come closer to me

CHRYSSA

he bends down)
Closer still

a smile a whisper)
Closer It cannot be that my
master is afraid of his slave --
can it

Donos kneels toward her by the metal binder she is chained
to Chryssas hands are doing something under Donos tunic --
their faces are almost touching her lips are parting Donos
The Conquerer is ready to take posession -- but

- Chryssa suddenly violently yanks her chain through its
iron binder - and Donos SHRIEKS in agony --

-- the insert shot would buy us an NC17 so instead lets
just show from Donos arched back and the now bloody chain

that Chryssa has guided some part of Donos between the chain
an e binder and yanking the chain has stripped some of

his flesh away

Their faces are still almost touching - Donos is SCREAMING
in pain and through her laughter Chryssa gets this out --

CHRYSSA
May all my tasks be so supremely
pleasant -- master

Enraged but still stuck in the binder Donos swings to grab
Chryssas face but she quickly pulls her head back and
the chain around her collar goes with it stripping more
flesh off of Donos --

Donos SCREAMS get louder and so does Chryssas LAUGHTER --
several more GUARDS come and pull out Donos One hits
Chryssa hard as they pull Donos away but she still laughs
It was worth it The other slaves look up more afraid of the
consequences than amused at what happened

CHRYSSA
Do you see Do you We dont have
to live this way
(beat)
We can fight back We can stand
together We can be free

But there is no rousing response from the galley Theyre too
afraid too broken to fight

Chryssa looks up to the hatch -- the only source of air and
light in the hold Inigo has returned He is talking to
Donos who is very shaky on his feet We cant hear what
theyre saying But the conversation ends -- Donos smiles -

- and he points down unmistakably singling out Chryssa
CUT TO
EXT DOCKS - UNDERWATER - A YOUNG MAN SWIMS UNDER A SHIP

-- he moves through the water as effortlessly as a fish hes
clutching a trident and he looks like hes totally in his
element Theres no sense in playing around on this one --
his name is NISUS but this twenty year old man is going to
be POSEIDON Even now as he swims through the water
smiling he looks like a god --

- until we notice that he has a chain on his ankle -- a
chain that goes straight up to the surface There is a rough
yank on the chain that jerks him out of his reverie -- sree

a second brutal yank he swims back up
ON THE PORT - NISUS CLIMBS UP

and we can see him now for what he is A slave His owner
the port director VANKO (40s) angrily pulls the chain

VANKO
The ships have not moved for two
months so you know they are in
repair You have no reason to go
into the water

(angry)

Your first task each morning is to
rinse the dock Remember that well

As Nisus crosses to Vanko we see that he is lame -- his
chained ankle has been ruined by years of abuse and
infection Nisus looks up angrily but --

VANKO
Before you speak Nisus mind the
poor market for one legged slaves
Perhaps I will accept Inigos
offer of twenty drachmas for a new
oarsman after all

Nisus keeps his eyes down Its always easier to go along --
to not resist

NISUS
Ill wash the deck at once

VANKO
Youll do it later You have
another task first

Vanko motions to the side A small light sailboat moves
around steered by Donos and Inigo He jumps to the dock
ties the ship up and drops the sail revealing --

CHRYSSA IS BOUND TO THE SHIP

by chains that are loosely wrapped around her wrists ankles
and the sail mast She looks as if she has been physically
beaten she put up a fight before she wound up here She
defiantly stares up at Nisus and the growing crowd who has
come for a show

Nisus is frozen Vanko strikes his back

VANKO
Get to work Secure her to that
mast

Vanko shoves some tools at Nisus If hes thinking about
resisting the surly mob behind Inigo and Vanko changes his
mind with cries of “bind her well slave etc

As Nisus steps to the ship Vanko turns to Inigo

VANKO
He will finish the job -- but it
appears she is already bound so
she cannot escape

INIGO
Her escape has nothing to do with
it Were sending her out to keep
the Serraton occupied so the
stronger her chains and the more
tearing required to devour her —
the longer I have to sail past
this miserable damned island

Even Vanko pales -- this guy is cold
IN THE BOAT - CHRYSSA AND NISUS ARE FACE TO FACE

as Nisus takes a hammer and some hooks to bind her chains to
the wooden mast Doing this job is killing him but he has no
choice Chryssa hisses into his ear urgently -

CHRYSSA
- cut me free -- it is within
your power --

NISUS
hammers in a hook)
Theyll kill me if I refuse

CHRYSSA
-- dont do this --

NISUS
(bends to her ankles)
I can do nothing -- I am a slave
like you

Nisus is finished Chryssa is disgusted

CHRYSSA
No You are not at all like me
and you are not even a slave
(beat)
You are my executioner

Nisus stares at Chryssa Nisus leg is violently yanked back

by Vanko -- and the crowd on the docks laugh Vanko shouts --
VANKO
Very touching Nisus - and very

sensible Had you done anything
else you would both be nailed to
that mast

(commands)
Now drop the sail

Nisus limps off the boat and drops the sail The ship goes
directly out with Hestia bound to the mast As it sails
under the Colossus and to open water she doesnt cry for
mercy or scream over whats going to happen -- she just
drills one last burning look to Nisus

You are my executioner
NISUS STARES AFTER HER

and whatever his thoughts are end as Vanko strikes his head

VANKO
Oh no little Nisus -- you shall
miss this spectacle Fetch some
bass and do not return until you
have a netful

Playing to the crowd Vanko gives Nisus a rough shove -- they
laugh -- and Nisus gimps away He picks up a trident and
dives into the water But -

UNDER THE DOCKS - NISUS MOVES UNDERNEATH

and there is a new look on his face determination Hes not
going to let it happen

Nisus takes the trident -- forces one of the tines into his
ankle binder -- and with a strength from years of toil and
buried anger from years of forced obedience --

-- Nisus breaks a link off the ankle binder -- he is free

Clutching the trident Nisus swims out underwater darting
out as fast as a dolphin Its time to drop the Nisus stuff
He doesnt know it yet but from here on out he is Poseidon

As Poseidon swims through the water we see all kinds of
bizarre sea creatures that no one in our time or our world
has ever seen Poseidon is swimming fifty feet above the

ocean floor -- a surge of water swirls up and he looks
down --

IN THE WATER BENEATH - A TWENTY FOOT TALL MONSTER

is lunging up from the ocean floor toward Poseidon -- it is
a Clawed one-eyed Seaclops A talon reaches out for Poseidon
as he darts up -- the talon almost almost gets him --

-- and the Seaclops falls back to the ocean floor ROARING
underwater in frustration It can leap but it cant swim

As Poseidon swims past our view something else slithers
past alerted We cant make it out in the murky water but
its dark silhoette is nothing but teeth and serrated edges
whipping through the water like an eel

IN THE BOAT - CHRYSSA STRUGGLES AGAINST THE CHAINS

She is afraid and angry as she tries to tear loose Those

hooks were really hammered in well As she struggles we see
something that she doesnt --

as her body writhes against the mast it is burnin
wherever she touches it -- she is hot and getting hotter
UNDERWATER POSEIDON HAS CAUGHT UP TO THE BOAT

and is breaking the surface to climb on board --

-- and just off in the distance we can make out a dark shape
that is moving through the water towards them

ON THE BOAT - POSEIDON CLIMBS OVER THE SIDE
still clutching the trident He takes in a deep breath -- not

gasping just breathing Pretty impressive considering he
just covered two thousand yards underwater

POSEIDON
catching his breath)
I -- am not -- your executioner

Chryssa cant believe what shes seeing Poseidon steps up to
her and raises his trident to pry loose the hooks -- but as
he touches her wrist his hand is seared Poseidon recoils in
pain and stares at her -- its his turn for incredulity

Chryssa twists her neck around to look at the mast -- it is
smoking and blackened wherever she touches it Even more
bizarre the bindings around her wrist are melting on the
inside rivulets of molten iron trickle down her arm

Only now does Chryssa look scared

CHRYSSA
(quiet afraid)
Whats happening to me

As her mouth opens we can see a blossom of flames licking
her throat

Before Poseidon can ponder this - the boat is rocked by blow
after blow -- he looks down --

A SAWTOOTH SEA BEAST

about fifteen feet long is hammering the boat to knock it
over or punch a hole in it This is a Serraton a hideous
nightmare of a shark its body covered in barbs

Poseidon finds his footing and jabs it with his trident --
after a series of fast rough stabs the Serraton retreats
Poseidon wipes the sweat from his brow but hes relieved

POSEIDON
Dont worry -- if thats all the
fight the Serraton can muster we
will soon sail to freedom

But Poseidon looks in the other direction -- the sea is
virtually boiling with activity racing toward the boat --

ANENTIRE SCHOOL OF SERRATONS ARE RACING TOWARD HIM

There are at least two dozen of them moving as one No way
is he going to be able to hold them off They all are clearly
Serratons though there are subtle differences in the size
and shape of each one At the same time --

CHRYSSA IS BURNING UP

and this is not a pleasant experience She is burning from
the inside out Shes scared and it is physically painful
The chains are melting around her the wood is singing black
behind her whenever seaspray hits her it HISSES into

steam her hemlines are burning back like fireworks

fuses -- she SCREAMS in pain as --

A DOZEN OF THE SERRATONS PROPEL OUT OF THE WATER

toward Poseidon -- reflexively he raises his arm to protect
himself -

-- and as he does a wave comes from out of nowhere
battering the beasts back into the sea

Poseidons look of fear turns into a smile -- he looks down
at his hands realizing somehow I did that As he looks at
his hands turning them over in wonder --

-- this gesture accidentally creates a spiralling wave behind
the ship that knocks it over sending him tumbling into the
water

CHRYSSA CLUTCHES THE EDGE OF THE BOAT

in pain -- she is getting hotter -- and she looks at the
water The school of Serratons which had been zigging and
zagging as if they were one being pauses --

-- and it literally becomes one being Now we see why each of
these creatures looks roughly the same but with small
differences the dozens of seabeasts each of them fifteen
feet long knit together into a single hundred foot Serraton
The Serratons barbs interlock and beasts seamlessly blend
into one being The legs form then the torso and arms and
finally the monstrous maw and head It is now an amphibious
walking giant -- the seawater only comes up to its thigh --

-- and it is striding toward Chryssa in the boat The

terrible mouth opens and BELLOWS the same monster call weve

heard before When it bellows its not just the big mouth

atop the head eve mouth from eve se t of the

Serraton SCREAMS in a terrifying chorus as it reaches for
ssa

IN THE WATER NEARBY - POSEIDON SURFACES

and gasps for air -- he sees whats happening and has to try
to stop it He looks around the water and raises his hand --

A TREMENDOUS WAVE SHOOTS OUT OF THE WATER

toward the Serraton and its carrying a gift -- a school of
stingrays sail toward the beast Dozens of them land on the
Serratons back and they frantically sting the beast --

-- but even this is just a moments distraction for the
Serraton With a shudder and a shake it sends the stingrays
flying off him -- and it bends down ready for its version of
sushi

THE GIGANTIC SERRATON GRASPS HESTIA

who is struggling for freedom -- wherever she touches the
beasts hand it steams - and the beast doesnt seem to
understand --

-- it throws Hestia into its mouth -- Hestias SCREAM echoes
out of the monsters cavernous mouth until it closes its
mouth and swallows

ON THE BOATS WRECKAGE - POSEIDON

cant believe it -- he thought they were going to make it --
POSEIDON
(screams)
No

THE SERRATONS MOUTH TWISTS INTO A SATISFIED SMILE

and it stalks through the water toward the second course
Poseidon

Poseidon raises his arm in one last attempt to fight back --
he summons a gigantic wave to surge toward the Serraton --
its as big as he is --

-- but as the wave strikes the Serratons body separates
slightly into a mesh of smaller monsters -- its still
knitted together but loosely enough that Poseidons wave
washes through it without knocking him over

Poseidon knows hes finished now The Serraton is upon him --
it reaches down but it suddenly seizes up --

- the Serraton reaches up to its throat letting out a
horrible gasp -- and the gasp gives way to a HISS OF STEAM
coming out of an everwidening tear in its throat -

- flame and steam are jetting out of eve joint of the
beast — and every “segment” of the Serraton shrieks in

——
pain --

CHRYSSA IS NOW ENTIRELY MADE OF FLAME

and she bursts out of the throat of the monster flying
around in a dizzying circle as the Serraton dead on its
feet collapses to the water in a gigantic splash As it
dies it changes color - and it breaks up into the group of
smaller seabeasts all of them dead

Chryssa -- whose celestial tag of HESTIA is in effect from
here on out -- flies around in joyous circles as she quickly
gets the hang of this

IN THE TRIREME NEARBY - ZEUS HADES DEMETER AND HERA

watch this and Zeus rolls up the chart -- the ship is just
arriving into these waters

ZEUS
There are the last two Hestia and
Poseidon

HADES

(sarcastic)
Were lucky to have such an
omniscient leader

(beat)
O Wise One - should we pick him up
before he has to fight off another
sea beast

IN THE AIR - CHRYSSA FLIES AROUND

and her terror subsides as she starts to get the hang of
this -- she rockets out toward Inigos slave ship

INSIDE THE SLAVE SHIPS GALLEY - A DRUMMER BEATS OUT

the rapid pace for the slaves working the oars -- weak and
exhausted they cant keep up but Donos paces through
whipping all malingerers

DONOS
Row you curs Row

Donos passes an oar slave who looks ready to die -- unable to
move he glances out the crack in the boards

OAR SLAVE POV - THE MONSTER IS DEAD IN THE WATER

but the slave sees something else -- something even more
impossible A streak of flame is shooting toward them -- and
as it draws closer it lTooks like it has a face --

-- and a horrible SLAP turns the oar slave around --

DONOS
Weve passed the monster slave --
now you only need fear my lash

Donos raises the whip to beat hell out of the slave -- but -
HESTIA BLAZES THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE SHIP

and moves between Donos and the slave -- she is a pure figure
of fire retaining a human shape

Everyone is afraid but no one more than Donos because
Hestias fiery face is glaring at him Donos is frozen in
fear -- Hestia could easily kill him --

but she waves a hand over the whip Her hand gets white
hot - and the whip instantly incinerated dissolves into
ash as Donos drops it

Donos and the other guards scramble to the top deck --

-- and Hestia gleefully flies down the galley aisle -- shes
starting to enjoy this She holds her hands out liquefying
the metal chain bindings to slag one after the other --

-- the oar slaves find new strength in freedom -- they get up
and tear off their chains as -

ON THE TOP DECK - INIGO IS FEASTING

in his customary way under a shade with a full table in
front of him as two dozen chained starving slaves look on

But something interrupts the feast -- first a hint of smoke

then pain - Inigo jumps up and sees a flame licking the
boards under his feet

Texrified Inigo moves back again as the flame rises -- now
Hestia is getting some control -- she can move between the
boards just burning part of them --

-- but as she rises she reforms into a fiery angry
apparition Inigo is terrified -

INIGO
Crossbows -- crossbows now

A group of GUARDS move around Hestia loading crossbows --
and they let loose the arrows --

-- and a half dozen arrows shoot right through Hestia
igniting as they pass through -- two of the archers are

killed by the crossbow crossfire the rest drop their weapons
and run

Hestia is the calm center of this storm -- she throws out
several fireballs that destroy the chains holding the slaves
on the deck

The slaves begin to realize that this creature has come to
help them and they have freedom if they want it The slaves
rush their captors fight them and drive them overboard --

- until Inigo is the only one left driven to the front of
the ship The freed slaves appear to be ready to kill him --

- but Hestia rockets toward Inigo who runs to the edge and
jumps off as she passes him close enough for a goodbye singe

The slaves quickly take posession of the ship -- those who
know how grab masts and the wheel and others start fairly
dividing Inigos feast

Hestia flies around the ship in a victory lap burning
through a couple of ropes to let loose a small lifeboat
Inigo Donos and the crew cling to it -- and --

HESTIA LOOKS DOWN AND SMILES

not so much at Inigo and Donos’ trouble as the fact that
these slaves are free -- because of her

Like a comet Hestia streaks back toward the port town
THE SHIP APPROACHES THE PORT - AN ANGRY VANKO IS THERE

with a few WORKERS all clutching gaffes and fishing
equipment -- they dont look as sure of this fight as Vanko

ON BOARD THE SHIP - ZEUS STEERS INTO PORT

and sees this reception They have now picked up Poseidon
who is exhausted and dripping wet Zeus turns to Poseidon --

ZEUS
Is this going to be a problem

POSEIDON
No Its just a job I forgot about
(off Zeus look)
Rinsing the dock
Poseidon raises his outstretched hand -- and as he does --
THE WATER SURGES UP UNDER THE PORT

- slowly at first -- as the water moves past their ankles
the workers drop their weapons and run --

-- Vanko who isnt aware that his mob has just run out on
him stands ready for a fight - but the water keeps

rising - and Poseidon whips a small wave at Vanko knocking
him off his feet The water drains away washing Vanko off

Zeus steers the ship into port Poseidon climbs off and ties
the boat up

On shore others drag a sputtering Vanko out of the water
all gaping at Poseidon and the others No one is going to
give these guys any trouble

ON THE DOCK - ZEUS AND POSEIDON ARE TYING THE SHIP

as the air CRACKLES around them - still ablaze Hestia lands
on the planks singing the wet wood

CLOSE ON HESTIAS FACE

as she changes back from a thing of fire to a young woman -
her look tells us shes still on a delirious high from this

ZEUS
Very nice

HESTIA
It was - amazing

still overwhelmed)
To give freedom to those whove
never tasted it and justice to
those who deserve it

ZEUS
Ahhh - that also was very nice

WIDER VIEW OF DOCK - HESTIA REALIZES SHE IS NAKED

as her clothes have burned off her Hera shoves past Poseidon
and Zeus and hands her a tunic

CUT TO
EXT FOREST CAMP - DAY SLABS OF ROCK LIFT IN THE AIR
and move toward each other assembling into a shelter
HESTIA AND DEMETER ARE WATCHING IN AWE

but it isnt really the levitation that impresses them

HESTIA
That isnt possible Shes been
travelling a hard road for -- how

long

DEMETER
Ten days At least
(beat)

I dont know how but I think she
just got better looking in the
past half minute

HERA IS TESTING HER POWERS OF LEVITATION

and practicing her control -- sweat is beading on her her
muscles are tensing but her performance is flawless Whats
equally amazing is that shes now truly gorgeous -- she looks

more like a swimsuit model on break than a stable girl whos
been on the run for days

HESTIA
So shes the goddess of --

DEMETER
Beauty
(sighs)
Id trade How about you
HESTIA
in a second Shes lifting more
than rocks right now
CLOSE BY - ZEUS IS GAPING AT HERA

almost hypnotically Hera looks back at Zeus smiling a
little shyly gaining in confidence She cant believe who
she’s turning into

CUT TO
EXT IN A SECLUDED BEACH DAY - POSEIDON IS IN THE WATER

with his head sticking out He is alone and clearly wants to
try something not sure if it will work Finally deciding he
ducks down --

UNDERWATER - POSEIDON LETS ALL THE AIR OUT

ef his lungs he pushes it out until the last bubble trails
up from his mouth -- and after hesitating a moment --

- he draws in his first breath of seawater -- and --
POSEIDON ROCKETS BACK UP TO THE SURFACE
coughing retching and gasping It didnt work

CUT TO

EXT IN THE WOODS - DAY - HADES IS WITH CERBERUS

in a place hes been before outside of the party Hes also
in a place weve all been in working up the nerve to talk to
someone youre in love with

Hades looks at Zeus talking to Hera and Poseidon playing
around with his power for Hestia and Demeter Hades plucks a
few flowers for Demeter --

HADES
“Demeter -- I wanted to thank you
for leaving those flowers for me
so -- no thats pathetic --
(reset)

In the forest watching you I
always thought the flowers were
twice as beautiful by the way you

carried them - thats worse --
Before Hades can bolster his nerve any more -- the flowers he
picked wither and die in his hand -- they decompose into

compost and ooze through his fingers

Imagine that happening when you were getting ready to make a
move on your high school crush

His hands coated in black decomposition Hades wipes them on
a tree frantic to get it off --

and as it comes off Hades sees that just this slight
involuntary use of his power has changed him His hand looks
slightly more gnarled slightly more demonic

Hades looks to the camp -- Demeter is looking around
probably looking for him but shes still having fun with the
others

Hades looks at Cerberus who senses somethings wrong and is

trying to cheer him up He grins a bony smile and nuzzles
Hades

But Hades isnt cheered by this He knows if he continues
with this hes going to have an entourage of skeletons And

the party going on with the others is something hell never
really be a part of

EXT CAMP - DAY HESTIA HOLDS A FINGER UP

and is practicing -- one finger becomes flame and focusing
she narrows it to white-hot heat --

-- and she turns to Poseidon running the flame across his
shackle still wrapped around his ankle

HESTIA
Hold still --
(she looks at chain)
- how did you pry this link off

POSEIDON
(wincing at heat)
With a fishing trident

HESTIA

One that you used every day

he nods)
So you could have taken your
freedom any time

(incredulous

contemptous)
Then why would you waste so much
of your life at this chains end

POSEIDON
Because until you were in danger
I had no reason to break free

Hestia looks up at Poseidon Hes not kidding hes not

bragging -- hes just being honest But shes still burning
through the shackle -- it falls off and Hestia burns
Poseidons ankle He leaps back --
POSEIDON
-- owww --
HESTIA

Im sorry Im sorry
Hestias hand becomes a hand again Poseidon just took a

little singe but as hes leaping around in pain he notices
something

Hes leaping around Not limping Leaping
Poseidon flexes that ankle looking down No scars there now

POSET DON
- my leg -- its whole again

Poseidon starts LAUGHING and dances around with Hestia Of
all the side benefits of being a god so far this is the best

IN ANOTHER PART OF THE ISLAND - ZEUS IS GLOWERING
and extending his hands in a feel the wrath of Zeus pose

But thats all it is -- a pose Nothing happens Hes gone
off by himself to try this god and power routine out

Zeus shakes off that one -- too corny -- and raises an
eyebrow a little more self assured a little more heroic --
he thrusts his hands out at a nearby rock in a zap pose --

-- and nothing happens There is a just a hint of THUNDER
burbling in the sky above but no fireworks At this rate
Zeus is not going to make the bench in the Triple A God
league much less bécome the God of Gods

Zeus looks puzzled disappointed and a little sheepish Hes
got to nail this Zeus puts on his game face and begins to
cycle both his arms around in a magic pitch windup -- his
hands suddenly freeze by his head aiming at a rock ten yards
ahead of him --

-- and Zeus summons lightning but it strikes ten feet behind
him That startles the vengeful god look right off his
face - he spins around in surprise

Zeus takes a breath Still needs work but thats enough for
now He starts down the hill --

-- and sees that Poseidon Hestia Hera and Demeter are

looking up They heard the thunder but apparently didnt see
the problems Zeus had

Zeus walks down with a regal air as if it went perfectly
CUT TO
EXT CAMPSITE - DAY DEMETER MOVES HER HAND

over some barren bushes -- and berries sprout bloom and
ripen in seconds She picks them for a basket

Nearby Poseidon is coaxing a small “drinking fountain to
appear from an underground spring

Hestia is learning some control as well -- she creates a
campfire thats not too big not too small

Hera and Zeus are there too Zeus seems pensive -- and Hera

tries to give him a reassuring smile It’s not enough to
clear his mind

Poseidon looks out at their boat docked nearby and smiles
Zeus sees this

POSEIDON
Since I was a child my whole life
has been ships Bending wood and
curing it in the sun Nailing
planks without splintering them
Sealing them dry

POSEIDON

And then watching someone else
sail them away to every part of
the world before starting work on
another

(beat)
I always wanted to be on the
ships top watching the world
glide by instead of underneath
stuck in the same spot

ZEGS
Then the ship is yours
Poseidon reacts)
Regardless of how our quest ends
That ship is yours as of now

Poseidon is astonished Slaves arent used to getting gifts
of any size much less this magnitude

POSEIDON
I cannot grasp the gifts Ive
received in one day Half a day

(beat)
My freedom -- my leg restored to
me - and a ship Such gifts --

HADES (0S)
-- always come at great price
Your humanity for example

Hades walks to the camp with Cerberus in tow

ZEUS
Ah The god of gloom Did you have
to return so quickly

Zeus eats some of the berries Demeter has created Theyre
good but not really enough

ZEUS
This is your home Poseidon Can
you tell us where we can find a
meal fit for men or gods

CUT TO
EXT THE MARKETPLACE NIGHT - AN IMPROMPTU CELEBRATION
is going on -- since the port has been cleared a group of
ships have made into the docks This market was barren this

morning -- now it is full of traders food and goods and the
locals who arent gorging themselves are singing and dancing

Zeus Hera Demeter Hades Hestia and Poseidon walk in
trying to be inconspicuous -- but theyre wearing a certain
amount of pride especially Poseidon and Hestia this
wouldnt be happening if they hadnt slain the monster

No one is really noticing who they are and that doesnt suit
Zeus

ZEUS
Are there no thanks for the
slayers of the Serraton Lets
make ourselves known --

Hades stops Zeus before he pipes up

HADES

I know your thirst for applause is
matched only by your reluctance to
think -- but believe me If this
crowd gets even a hint of the
unknown they will not bow and
pray they will sharpen their
knives

beat)
For once in your life for the
good of us all remain quiet

Zeus is about to answer back but Hera defuses this with a
laugh and takes his arm dragging him away from Hades

zeus gets some wine from a merchant and drinks deeply he
looks over a few feet away --

HERA IS SMILING AND DANCING

next to some musicians -- she is drawing admiring glances
from the men there and she knows it Shes reveling in it
She didnt get this kind of attention as a stable rat

She catches Zeus’ eye and now shes more confident than
before -- she waves him over

Zeus makes his way through the crowd and hands Hera his
giass of wine

ZEUS
I have a message from your horse
(indicating her dress)
Hed like the blanket back

Hera almost frowns -- but Zeus pulls a bundle from behind his
back and hands it to her smiling Its a new beautiful gown
74

ZEUS
The finest silk fresh from the
east
she takes it)
Youre the goddess of beauty Its
time you had clothes that suited
you

Hera is thrilled -- shes never been within arms length of
a gown like this much less worn one Smiling she throws her
arms around Zeus and kisses him lightly

Zeus is surprised by the suddenness of this -- and Hera is a
little surprised she did this shes a little embarrassed
and a little excited All of this is new to her She steps
away to find some place to put it on

ELSEWHERE IN THE CROWD - SOME VILLAGERS ARE WATCHING

the new gods -- Hestia and Poseidon are nearby and Hestia is
discreetly but clearly heating some food with her hands The
vino drinking villagers are whispering among themselves

VILLAGER 1
-- but they rescued us from the
sea beast

VILLAGER 2

They did -- and for what I heard
one call another a god

(beat)
Can you tell me what the gods have
done lately other than ponder new
ways to slaughter us for their
amusement

The other villager cant refute this -- he nods in agreement
and drinks deeper Meanwhile --

ZEUS WATCHES AS HERA RE-EMERGES IN HER NEW GOWN

and she looks gorgeous She knows it too She makes her way
back through the crowd and Zeus is so entranced by her --

-- that he doesnt get even a seconds notice before a fist
plows into his chin - the sucker punch rocks Zeus off his
feet A little dazed he looks up and sees --

-- the same pancratium fighter from the beginning of the
movie and apparently a sailor on one of the arriving ships
His facial cuts arent healing so well -- and his menacing
words are undercut a little by the fact that his missing
teeth are giving him a whistle when he talks

FIGHTER
Ive accepted your invitation
Gregos
motions around)
Your audience is assembled But
where is your fight

The fighter flashes his new hockey-goalie grin Zeus a
little dazed starts to get up -- but his opponent savagely
kicks him back into the mud

The fighter grabs an oak paddle gives it a few test swings —-

FIGHTER
Well see if your latest whore
will still be interested in you
(swings plank
through the air)
-- after I grant you a face like
the one you gave me

CLOSE ON ZEUS BLOODIED FACE

Hes angry -- the crack about Hera made him madder than the
punch As Zeus struggles up his fist clenches --

-- and electricity crackles around the fist

Zeus stands and he raises his hand not for a regular blow
but for a lightning strike --

The fighter charges Zeus with the oak paddle ready to cave
his head in - but just as he swings --

-- Zeus summons a bolt of lightning and hurls it --

- and unexpectedly amerchants table tips over and flies
up between Zeus and the fighter -- it BrSces the fighters
paddle blow but it also takes the brunt of the lightning
blast

The lightning bolt blasts the table to splinters -- enough
leaks through to knock the fighter off his feet as the oak

paddle catches fire in his hand

HERA STANDS NEARBY

with her hands raised -- she threw the table up to end the
fight
Now everything has come to a halt -- everyone in the

marketplace is gaping at Zeus and Hera in uncomprehending
fear The only sound is the receding echoing THUNDER

THE FIGHTER

is terrified now A brawl is one thing but he was just
almost roasted alive His hand is burnt and he scrambles
backward running and shoving his way through the crowd

ZEUS LOOKS SURPRISED

at how far out of control he just was Smoke is pouring from

his hand and Zeus looks at the table - its been reduced to
ashes What really has Zeus thrown is the realization that he
almost killed someone over a sucker punch

Everyone in the crowd is moving away from Zeus in fear and
surprise Hestia Hades Poseidon Demeter and Hera come
together through the momentarily dazed crowd

HADES
I know you have a limited
education but this doesnt fit
any definition of the word quiet
(beat)
We must leave now while they are
still confused and afraid

ZEUS
hot)
Thats the second time youve
given me a command Hades -- I

will not abide such a challenge
from you or from anyone --

HADES

Should we remain here until the
crowd gathers courage and weapons
Will you summon lightning to kill
them all for daring to
challenge the mighty Zeus

(beat)
Tf thats the kind of compassion
and wisdom youll carry into
godhood then Cronus continued
reign is looking better and better

Zeus cant answer -- Hades is right but hell never admit it
Hera and the others pull him and Hades away to leave before
the crowd turns on them

EXT CAMPSITE - NIGHT - THE NEW GODS

are around a fire that Hestia is fueling The mood is very
different here -- not jubilant or optimistic but quiet and
uncertain Zeus in particular is lost in thought -- he wasnt
exactly the model of leadership a while ago

The only one missing here is Hades -- and he walks up to the
fire Everyone looks up He has his pack on and is clearly
ready to go

HADES
I want no further part of this
madness

Everyone is surprised by this and Demeter is particularly
stricken

HADES

To you this may be an adventure
or a quest or some other romantic
phrase To me its a curse

Have you noticed that the more you
use your abilities -- your
gifts - the more of your
humanity you surrender

In my case Im becoming ever so
slightly more demonic -- more
deathly -- every time I use magic
even without intending to

Your leg has been restored But
where will your transformation
end Will you become a fish or
will you dissolve into water
itself We have no idea what this
will do to us or where it will end

Zeus starts to speak up but Hades waves him off --

HADES
Youdo not know where this will
end Zeus -- and by the way I
Saw you in the woods before
(mocks spell pose)
Apparently you do shoot lightning
bolts out of your ass

ZEUS
Thats more than enough --

HADES
And for the first time were in
full agreement This is absolute
futility

Hades dumps the scrolls from his pack into the fire -- and as
the fire flares we see how much this surprises everyone
They were the only things Hades brought from what passed for
his home

HADES
Im not carrying the burden of
these wild ravings for you any
longer The rest of you can stay
and play god with this lunatic
Im leaving Come on Cerberus

Hades starts off and Demeter rushes up to Hades

DEMETER
Please -- wait Myles

I believe him We must stop
Cronus --
HADES

Why So I can be king of the
damned and that hothead can be
the lord of everything else

His rule isnt worth my life or
yours
DEMETER

If he’s right this will become a
world of monsters sent by Cronus
We must protect people from them

HADES

Ordinary people Like the

kill me for an evenings
entertainment

Poseidon)
The same ordinary people who
enslaved you two and tens of
thousands like you

Youre very sweet Chloe I will
miss you But the fact is this

How can that be How can I love

Do you hear how ridiculous that

The childs POV stops in front of one of the slaves -- and
the slave stops digging

appreciation for the drink but also with love The slave
reaches down to pick up the child --

EXT HESTIA AWAKENS WITH A START - DAWN

she was sleeping under a tree and she wakes up a little

DEMETER

No look --

HIGH UP ON A MOUNTAIN CLIFF - ZEUS STANDS

and holds his cracked sword over him -- the RUMBLE of thunder
builds to a crescendo --

- and six lightning bolts strike the blade at once -- not as

split second strikes these hold like six circuits hard wired
to the sky --

CLOSE ON ZEUS

who feels like hes mastered this force of nature -- and
still the lightning bolts are holding --

twilight -- but as Zeus sheathes his sword we can see its
crack has been mended

ON THE GROUND - HESTIA HERA POSEIDON AND DEMETER

look up at Zeus -- the THUNDER is still echoing -- and any

doubts they had about following him drain away Zeus is their

Zeus and Poseidon exchange a quizzical look This makes no
sense The wind is almost at storm strength --

- and the ship comes to a dead stop in the water
HESTIA
(off Zeus confusion)
Should we have shopped around for
a god of wind before setting sail

Suddenly the ship lurches as it begins moving again --

-- only now it is sailing against the wind and smashing
against the waves -- the strain on the sails is about to snap
the mast --

-- and the ship tilts -- everyone slides around the deck and
grabs for something anything to hold onto
THE SHIP SMASHES THROUGH THE WAVES BOW FIRST
with planks SPLINTERING from each fierce impact --
ON THE DECK ZEUS
struggles up from the water washing over the deck --
ZEUS
Poseidon -- clear a path through
the waves
gasps over water)

Hestia drop the sail

Poseidon was overwhelmed but on hearing this he climbs up
to the mast and starts up it --

-- even as the mast GROANS with the strain of being pulled
against the wind As the masts base Hestia hangs onto the
rolling ship and tries to undo the sail line -- but its
hopelessly fouled

Hestia impatiently aims up at the sail line and lets loose
with a half dozen fireballs --

ON THE MAST - POSEIDON CLIMBS UP AS FIREBALLS WHIZ BY HIM

singing his ears -- Poseidon looks down at Hestia like any
chance you could make this more difficult

But it works -- enough of the fireballs connect with the mast
line and burn through -- the sail loosens and whips off in
the wind letting some of the pressure off the boat --

Poseidon reaches the top of the mast and anchors himself
against the wind -- and from this vantage he can see a

gigantic wave sixty feet high is approaching -- if it
breaks on the boat theyre finished

ON THE DECK - ZEUS HERA DEMETER AND HESTIA

can see the wave too -- it is so high and so close its
casting a shadow over them --

ON THE MAST - POSEIDON THROWS OUT HIS ARMS
and focuses -- if he blows this theyre done -

-- the wave crests over them and is about to drop all of its
fury on the ship -- but just as theyre about to be swamped --

AQUIVERING TUNNEL PARTS IN THE WAVE

and the ship sails into the tunnel through the wave and
out the other side

As they pass through Poseidon struggles to keep this up but
along with the strain we can see exhiliaration on his face
He cant believe hes doing this -- but hes doing it

As the ship comes through the wave everyone looks
relieved -- if they can beat that they can beat anything --

-- but at that moment the ships bow lifts -- it points up --
THE SHIP LEAVES THE WATER AND SAILS INTO THE AIR

As the ship moves up it flips over -- everyone on deck is
desperately reaching for something to hold onto --

ON THE DECK - ZEUS CLINGS TO THE WHEEL

and looks down Everything that was loose on the deck has
been thrown off The wooden items -- casks and planks -- are
falling into the fast-receding water But the items that are

metal are sailing up through the air --

ZEUS
Its drawing the metal

Zeus looks up through this apparent storm and into the sky
Something too black to be a cloud is up there

ZEUS
shouts to others)
The island isnt in the sea -- it

is in the sky
ON THE WEAKENED MAST - POSEIDON HOLDS ON FOR HIS LIFE

But there is very little to hold on to -- the magnetism of

the island is drawing out the nails that hold the ship
together --

AT THE MASTS BASE - THE METAL COLLAR HOLDING THE MAST

is coming loose where Hestia clings to it -- she knows that
Poseidon will be thrown if it breaks off and she puts her

hand on the collar trying to weld the weakening seams shut --
ON THE DECK - DEMETER HANGS ON

Because thats all she can do at this point --

-- the ship GROANS under the pressure as each metal fixture
works its way loose -

At the ships figurehead Hera hangs on terrified --

ZEUS
(shouting to Hera)
-- hoid the ship together -
off her fearful look)

-- youre the only one who can do
re y
it

Hera snaps out of her fear and tries focusing her
telekinetic power --

ON THE SHIPS UNDERSIDE - THE NAILS POP OUT OF PLANKS

like bullets and the ship is falling apart -- but it slowly
starts to bind back together --

ON THE SHIPS DECK - HERAS HANDS DIG INTO THE DECK

And her face is a mask of concentration and strain -- this is
by far the biggest hardest task shes tried yet -- but --

THE MAST SNAPS OFF THE BOAT
and whirls off into the storm taking Poseidon with it --

-- the metal collar spins loose knocking Hestia away

-- Hestias SCREAM distracts Hera -- her concentration is
gone and so is the force holding the boat together --

B86

ZEUS
-- no --
THE ENTIRE BOAT EXPLODES IN A BURST OF PLANKS SAILING OUT

and down and metal sailing out and upward --

ZEUS TUMBLES FROM A DEBRIS CLOUD THAT USED TO BE THE SHIP

-- he grabs an anchor that is hurtling up past him --

- and Zeus rides the anchor up away from the ship and the
others

CLOSE ON ZEUS ANGUISHED FACE

as he hurtles up helplessly looking down at the falling

wreckage his eyes might be tearing from the wind and the
speed and they might be tearing because hes sure hes blown
it -- the others couldnt have survived that

As the wooden sections of wreckage fall away every bit of

metal - knives boits jagged and torn ironwork -- swarms up
toward Zeus -

-- with one arm hooked on the anchor hes riding Zeus raises
his other arm to his face guarding it against this shrapnel
which slices his arm as it passes up --

-- as the metal storm passes him by Zeus takes his arm away
from his face and looks up -- his eyes widen -

ZEUS POV - THE UNDERSIDE OF THE ISLAND IS COMING UP FAST

- the islands underside is lined pincushion style with
every imaginable nautical blade spike and mast drawn up from
other ships and Zeus is rocketing toward a grouping of them
that will shred him --

ZEUS LEAPS FROM THE ANCHOR HES RIDING

just before it SMASHES into the island and cleaves through
the blades --

-- Zeus is now hanging in midair -- his momentum takes him

up just barely up near the tip of a rounded mast sticking
out -- Zeus lashes out an arm grabs it and starts sliding
off but he hooks an arm around it Safe for a moment

Until he looks down

The rest of the ships metal wreckage -- nails bindings
anchor chains everything is bulleting toward him

Zeus swings off the mast hes gripping and begins a frantic
climb up grabbing other poles and wreckage to try to climb

up and dodge the flying pieces around him splintering rock
and clanging against metal

-- one pole tears out of the island rock -- Zeus slips back
and flails for another -- he climbs past skeletons of others
impaled on the masts - and ultimately Zeus makes it up the
rocks side The further he goes the better protected he is
by the forest of metal beneath him Finally --

AT ISLANDS TOP - ZEUS BLOODIED HAND GROPES OVER THE EDGE
zeus pulls himself over aimost collapsing The only sounds
beneath him are the thankfully distant clangs of metal
hitting stone and Zeus own gasps -- until -

CRONUS (0S)
You have taken a long journey to

kill me -- just as the prophecy
foresaw

(beat)
May I offer some advice to a young
god

Battered and exhausted Zeus looks up --
CRONUS STANDS BEFORE HIM

and he looks completely unworried about Zeus arrival He is
flanked by his guards -- a pair of DECONOCHIERES —-
monstrous reptilian giants with ten massive scaled arms
and a special backpack sheath that holds ten swords

CRONUS
When it comes to prophecies --
dont believe everything you hear

With a nod from Cronus the Deconochieres move toward Zeus --
their fanged grins and casual flexing of all twenty of their
arms indicate theyre not expecting any trouble from Zeus --

- and Zeus is a bent bloodied heap -- but he still manages
to raise an arm summoning a lightning bolt -

-- the bolt strikes directly in front of a deconochiere --
the bolt splits and electrifies five of his swords singing
him and throwing him backwards ——

-- the other deconochiere is on Zeus in a second rushing him
and drawing ten swords out of their sheaths -

-- Zeus draws his sword as well and ducks as five sword
strikes whistle over his head -- Zeus swings up with his
blade shaving off two of the creatures arms -- it HOWLS in
pain and reels backwards

Zeus runs from the beast running up a rock to launch himself
at Cronus -- he knows hell never get another chance Zeus
leaps toward Cronus sword first --

-- Cronus looks surprised and maybe just a bit frightened
as Zeus buries the sword to the hilt in Cronus’ chest

Cronus sweeps Zeus away with his arm and Zeus sails off to
crash against the rocks --

Cronus staggers back against a rock -- the sword which was
bathed in the fire of the sky unleashes its power in an
electrical storm that pours out of Cronus’ chest

Bloodied and now really drained Zeus looks up and smiles in

relief Hes won The others died but at least hes defeated
Cronus who is now gasping against the rock

But Cronus’ gasp becomes something else as the electrical
charge of the sword subsides -- it turns into a hoarse
rasping laugh -

CRONOS
What childs tale were you told
about my death

Cronus withdraws the sword from his chest leaving behind
no mark no wound

CRONOS
That I would be defeated by this
toy A magic sword forged in
lightning

ZEUS LOOK OF TRIUMPH MELTS

as Cronus recovers That was it That was everything he had
and it wasnt nearly enough Zeus is yanked up by a very
pissed off deconochiere as -

AT THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND - ANOTHER SURVIVOR CLIMBS UP

We see a female hand at first -- and as she drags herself up
weak and wounded we see it is Demeter

FURTHER BACK IN THE ISLAND - ZEUS STRUGGLES

but hes held fast by the deconochieres as Cronus strides
over reaches down and takes her hand
Cronus pulis Demeter up with one hand -- and with
thrusts Zeus sword into her chest - Demeter dies w

pained anguished look -- her eyes are locked on

-- Zeus who is furious and devastated struggling i the
arms of the deconochiere

Cronus grabs Demeters face and forces her to speta mis
final moment looking at him

CRONOS
What was I thinking when I created
you
(disdainful)

There will be no need for a
goddess of life on what Earth will
become

With that Cronus yanks the sword out of her ches
all thats holding her up and she plunges off the i
falling miles to the earth below

ZEUS
-- no --
Zeus struggles held by the deconochiere - and th»
he turned into an octochiere stalks toward him wit
arms each holding a sword -- the creature flips the

around so that its brandishing the hilt side anc
ZEUS POV - ALL FOUR SWORD HILTS SWING TOWARD HIS Face

and connect one after another - and each of the fou
blows gradually darkens the POV until we reach --

BLACK SCR
UP FROM BLACK

EXT A SMALL ISLANDS BEACH - WOODEN BOAT WRECKAGE

is everywhere -- it looks more like a plane crash
a boat wreck site Half buried in the sand we fi
who is out cold -- but as the waves lap over Pose
starts to come around Poseidon staggers to his fees

POSEIDON
- Hestia

Poseidon searches for her ripping every bit of w
from the sand and seagrass -- until finally he fi

- Hestia is perfectly still in a heap in the ceri-
own impact crater She looks as if she could be dear

Poseidon picks her up frantic --

POSEIDON
Hestia -
Hestias eyes flutter open -- and Poseidon smiles in relief
POSEIDON

I thought you were dead

HESTIA
(a little weak)
Didnt you hear Im a goddess We
dont kill so easily

Poseidon smiles at her -- but her smile fades She is looking
over Poseidons shoulder in disbelief Poseidon turns too -

ALL OF THE WATER SURROUNDING THE ISLAND IS RISING

but not the way water usually does lapping and advancing up
a shore --

-- this water rises vertically - ten feet then twenty then
thirty like a suspended circular tsunami frozen in time --

Poseidon and Hestia gape at this and turn around -- the
water keeps going up in each direction seventy and eighty
feet up yet leaving the island itself perfectly dry

HESTIA
If youre doing this to impress
me you can stop now -- please --
Poseidon looks up -- the ring of rising water is at least two

hundred feet up now blocking the sun --
POSEIDON
Its come for me I can handle
this but you have to leave right
away

HESTIA
I can take care of myself --

POSEIDON
Not unless you can burn underwater

Poseidon looks up -- the towering ring of water has stopped --

POSEIDON
Get out of here now

Hestia finally realizes it’s her only option she ignites --

HESTIA FLIES STRAIGHT UP THROUGH THE OPENING

as the water turns in and starts crashing down -

-- still ablaze Hestia flies up through the center of the
cascading water -- the mist sizzles around her but her flame
holds --

ON THE ISLAND POSEIDON STARES UP AT THE TONS OF WATER

rushing toward him -- he doesnt run because theres nowhere
to run to He raises his hand and concentrates --

ABOVE THE WATER - A FLYING HESTIA LOOKS DOWN

and its an amazing terrifying sight You cant even see the
island any more just a gigantic bulge in the sea dumping
down where Poseidon stands

ON THE ISLAND POSEIDON STANDS WITH HIS ARM RAISED

and hes trying to keep it raised in an act of courage but
he is clearly afraid Hes not raising his hand to stop the
water hes raising it the way a slave would to stave off a
beating

The first of the water reaches Poseidon -- and hes causin
are REGRESS FOSELCOR causing

the water to flow around him —-—

-- but the strain is too much -- the weight the pressure
the velocity of the water break through Poseidons defense --

THE WATER CRASHES DOWN ONTO POSEIDON

with one crushing blow after another hammering him down --

CLOSE ON POSEIDONS FACE

-- his eyes are shut and he looks haif dead from the impact
until he vanishes completely into the sand

SOME DISTANCE AWAY - HESTIA IS AFLAME

and shes flying far from this aquatic battle -- with the
water pouring down it looks like an imploding hurricane But
theres nothing she can do to help here -- so she flies to a

nearby island
ON A ROCKY LEDGE - HESTIA LANDS

and reclaims her human form Almost all of it anyway Her
clothes are burned away (again) but shes gotten enough
control to use flame as clothing Just enough of it covers
her ass to cover ours with the MPAA

As she stands on the rock ledge looking out at the fight -

-- the sheetrock ripples and shudders under her like a
horses flesh does when a fly lands on it

Hestia feels this and climbs up to the next ledge It
shudders too --

and slams shut on her like a trap --

-- Hestia dives out ahead of it just clearing the stone as
the rocks slam together throwing out dust and wind --

- Hestia falls to the ground just three feet ahead of her --

-- but before she lands the ground itself falls away under
her staying just ahead of her fall -- she falls ten more
feet then twenty --

-- until the ground stops receding and Hestia stops hard
landing at the feet of

COEUS - THE TITAN OF ELEMENTS

Coeus appears human But his skin is uneven and granular
Some is brown some is rust colored some is black And as he
cracks a smile -- that is literally what hes doing You can
hear his face muscles grinding When he speaks his voice is
like something echoing out of a cavern

COEUS
You wouldnt know it to look at
me -- but Im very very angry
(contemptuous)

This uprising is the most exciting
thing to happen in thousands of
years And Cronus wastes the time
of Coeus with a broken little
stick of a girl

(beat)
My only wish was to fight one of
you who would present a momentary
challenge

Hestia looks up at him angry Her flame is returning

HESTIA
Granted

Enflamed Hestia rockets toward Coeus and burns through him --
-- and Coeus is no longer laughing -- he is engulfed in flame

and the layers of his body seem to be stripping away -- there
are layers of granite metal bubbling liquid

ON HESTIAS FLAMING SMILE

as she turns around and moves in for more she rushes
Coeus and surrounds him with her flaming body --
HESTIA
Poor little Coeus -- shall I kiss
it and make it better
Hestia moves in and gives Coeus a blazing kiss -- and his
stone face is melting now - it looks like Muenchs Scream

In an instant Coeus is just a puddle at her feet Hestia
still ablaze looks down in triumph at the puddle --

- and the puddle looks back Hestias reflection becomes

Coeus smile Vapors rise from the puddle and swirl around
Hestia --

-- and whatever elements are in this gas are no good for
fire -- Hestias flame flickers out -- she cant breathe and
is forced” to go back to human form

As she stands there coughing and vulnerable Coeus reforms
from gas back to solid stone and metal -- and It’s obvious
his defeat was a trick He looks as strong as ever With a
flick of his hand --

METAL ORE TEARS UP FROM THE EARTH

in sheets strips and clumps and flies toward Hestia --

-- the metal binds to her body stamping out any flame she
tries to raise In seconds she is in a rough hewn
sarcophagus with just one slash across one eye allowing her

to look out

Coeus walks up to her Hes won

COEUS
Poor little Chryssa They told you
your destiny was in the sky -- and

you believed it

Coeus kicks Hestia over and she topples --

-- but she doesnt hit the ground The ground opens up around
her and ahead of her as she falls

CLOSE ON HESTIAS EXPOSED EYE AS SHE FALLS HEAD FIRST

Shes staring straight ahead straight down as the ground
burrows down ahead of her faster and faster --

- until suddenly the ground stops moving -- and the hole
at least a mile deep seais in above her

CUT TO
EXT RIVERBANK DAY - HADES AND CERBERUS ARE WALKING

by a winding river Cerberus is happily running from rock to
rock with sunbeams breaking through his tattered skin and
empty skeleton -- until a shadow blocks the sun Hades looks
up --

-- and there is clearly some bad weather coming There is a
huge thundercloud in the sky -- but it doesnt look like a
raincloud It looks like something that could swallow the
earth - and its growing

Cerberus looks up too - and he turns his open eyes to Hades

HADES
Stop it Cerberus I did the right
thing Id have been no help to
them anyway
(not convinced)
And try to stay in the shade
Youre getting a sunburn

Hades runs down the riverbank happily yipping wagging a
tail and losing another chunk of it But as they move
upstream into a mist -

-- a small dark boat moves from the mist and into view --
and a single shrouded OARSMAN steadily takes it through
There is just one item of cargo in the open --

- the unmistakably lifeless body of Demeter

HADES IS DEVASTATED

as the boat passes by He runs after it jumping from
slippery rock to slippery rock as Cerberus follows -

HADES
shouts at boat)
- Demeter -- Stop
But the oarsman doesnt even acknowledge Hades -- he drives
the boat relentlessly ahead through the mists Hades runs
after him but its like a chase in a nightmare there is

nothing he can do there are rocks and branches blocking his
every step --

and ultimately the ship steers into a dark cavern

Hades doesnt hesitate he runs as fast as he can clumsily
splashing into the cavern --

- with water running through his exposed ribcage Cerberus
runs in as weil and the moment theyre both in --

THE CAVERN IS A DISTORTED UNEARTHLY HOLE

that is vastly and impossibly larger than the outer passage
made it appear to be It appears to be an entire other world
not merely a tunnel The trickle that ran into the passage
outside is a raging whitewater river here -- the boat is
that much further away

Hades is frightened but he has to follow Demeter -- he runs
down the bank of this hellish river further into the
darkness further into Hell itself Even Cerberus sticking
close to Hades is whining fearfully

Hades runs slipping on the rocks further down the river
The only light comes from campfires as blue skinned demons
roast the living and eat them alive The only sounds are that
of the damned -- there are so many near and far young and
old men and women that their shrieks squeals and screams
blend together like terrifying music

Hades runs and runs not just to get to Demeter but to get
away from demons whove spotted him -- until finally he
reaches a calm cavernous area and he sees

DEMETERS DEAD BODY ON THE ALTAR OF THANATOS

and its a devastating sickening sight She doesnt look
like Sleeping Beauty She looks like a beautiful young woman
who was butchered Her face is frozen in horror The Altar of
Thanatos crafted from human and demonic skulis makes this
picture even worse

Hades stumbles to her in disbelief Leaning on the Altar he
reaches out to touch her -- he holds back -- and he realizes
theres no reason not to Shes already dead

Hades caresses her arm and his tears well up --

HADES
(quiet shattered)
I should have gone with you -- I
could have stopped this
(takes her hand)
I’m sorry Demeter --

Hades crying chokes off anything else he might have said --
and his grieving is ended as suddenly --

- a powerful green blast tears Cerberus from the ground and
huris him against a wa -- what little skin he had is
Vaporized 5 bones smash against the cavern like chalk
Shocked anew Hades looks up --

THANATOS ENTERS THE CAVERN

and he is the twisted demonic Titan who rules the reaim of
Death When he speaks his tremulous bass voice seems to come
from every direction but especially from underneath the
ground

THANATOS

I knew that though you would
scarcely dare speak to her in
life you would follow her through
her death - and directly to yours

(contemptuous)
Can Cronus be right That you were
to come and challenge the rule of
Thanatos

Forget the moments of magic hes had or his sardonic sense
of humor Hades is stripped to his core he looks like a kid
whos paralyzed with fear and grief

cuT TO
THE NIGHTMARE OF ZEUS

which is instantly recognizable as such -- its a dreamscape
of terrible unreality passing in flashes of images --

-- he sees Hera falling away in front of him her face
showing her trust in him was betrayed --

-- there is a BLINDING FLASH of lightning --

- and a nightmarish vision of a Grecian city attacked by
monsters from above and below shattering buildings and
shredding people --

and among the fleeing are Zeus parents -- horribly burned
and barely alive but shouting at Zeus --

FATHER
You could have stopped it
Gregos --
(beat)
why didnt you stop it

ZEUS EYES SHOOT OPEN

and he finds that he is in the Chamber of the Titans -- a
room that appears to glow as if the walls and floor were made
of light

Cronus is absently toying with the creation of a new monster
modeled in his hands from mere thought Its a demonic
abomination -- something about the aesthetics doesnt please
the deity -- so he tosses it toward one section of the wall
where it vanishes

Cronus glances at the images of Zeus nightmare projected on
the wall -- and Cronus is smiling at one of Zeus monsters

CRONUS
Thats a nice one May I

Cronus plucks the image of the monster from Zeus dream --
and places it into a wall showing a part of Earth The
monster goes from dream to reality as simple as that

CRONUS
Your mind is an open window to me
Zeus Would that the actual
extermination of mankind be as
amusing as your fears of it I
shall do my best to live up to it

beat

Hes right you know You could
have stopped me

Cronus moves around the room Images of the universe -- the
births of stars the destruction of worids -- follow him as
he walks
CRONUS
When I annihilated you -- Oranos

retreived the energy that you are
and reformed you He granted you
vastly more power than I had - if
and only if you chose to seize it

Images on the wall change to ones from Zeus mind -- he is
enjoying himself as a human with simple pleasures with
wine with women ultimately with Hera

CRONUS
But you did not You clung to your
humanity Like a child refusing to
grow taller

CRONUS
You failed to understand that your
godhood is the reality -- it is

your humanity that is an illusion
created by Oranos to hide you from
me

(beat)
Your tragedy is that the illusion
of humanity hid your godhood not
just from me - it hid the real
you from yourself Since you would
not accept your godhood -- now it
is gone

Zeus stands -- now ready again for a fight But Cronus laughs

CRONUS
Do not shame yourself by trying
again after youve lost so
completely Ive stripped your
power from you and applied it to
the elimination of all that Oranos
has built -- the recreation of my
new world -- Tartarus

Cronus waves a hand and the floor becomes transparent below
them revealing an enormous obsidian thunderhead beneath the
island Lightning flashes within it but it doesnt look like
an ordinary thundercloud -- it appears to be more solid It
is growing moving out in all directions -- and every few

moments a new monstrousity flies out of it heading toward
Earth

CRONUS

The spreading darkness will
envelop and eliminate the world
you knew -- and replace it with
one filled with far more spectacle
and entertainment than humans
alone could provide

(beat)
Men make poor protagonists But as
prey they provide an amazing range
of reactions And we do enjoy the
reactions very very much

Rhea enters smiling She definitely enjoys the show

ZEUS
You bastard

Cronus paces around again -- and flashes of the cosmos follow
him everywhere at a frantic dizzying pace

CRONUS

Correct So are you We both are
parentless creations of the
universe

(beat)
Oranos declared that we existed to
serve the cosmos I see it
precisely the other way around
And you couldnt be bothered to
decide at all So I thank you

This conversation is nearing an end As Cronus speaks he and
Rhea seem to grow larger and larger at least ten times Zeus
size

CRONUS

Since you couldnt accept your
fate and command it youve
guaranteed that I may do so in
your place for eternities Youve
granted me the power Oranos denied
me -- enough to remake the world
as I see it As the others are
defeated I shall drink in their
power as well -- and I shall gain
the strength to control time and
space itself None will challenge
me again

(beat)
Since you apparently want to
remain human the very least I can
do to repay you is to honor your
wish -- and send you where my
other disappointments dwell
Goodbye Gregos

Cronus and Rhea now tower over Zeus -- and with a dismissing

glance from Cronus Rhea casually kicks Zeus away as you
would a cockroach --

-7 the impact from Rheas small kick is incredible - Zeus
goes flying directly toward one of the walls But before he

can impact against it the image on the wall changes to that
of a dark forest --

-- and Zeus passes into and through the wall --
EXT TITANS ISLAND NIGHT- ZEUS ROLLS DOWN A HILL

thats made of sharp rock and fringed with tangled thorny
vines -- and every bump every hit is shattering He is
definitely mortal - by the time he lands with a pained cry
hes picked up some brand new lacerations

Zeus struggies to get up weakly He has hurt his leg and
moves with a limp But above him there is a low ROAR -- Zeus
looks up to see --

A GROUP OF BIZARRE MONSTERS

who are Cronus rejects -- malformed demons who failed to
pass muster and have been thrown into this celestial dump

One is a winged serpent with a lions head Another is a
reptilian wolf with the face of a cyclops Yet another is an
arachnid with as many heads as legs all whipping out and
snapping at Zeus

The beasts pick up the scent of Zeus biood smeared on the
rocks where Zeus fell The reptilian wolf sniffs the rocks --
then licks them -- and then howls loudly in delight --

-- the beasts race through the brush on the trail of blood
ZEUS RUNS INTO THE FOREST

and is now living out a classic nightmare -- he is unarmed
and helpless He runs but his feet slog in the mud and
thorned vines rip into his flesh --

THE BEASTS TAKE UP ZEUS TRAIL

and move through quickly -- their skin is so tough the vines
dont bother them and they are clearly overtaking Zeus --
until finally --

AT THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND - ZEUS IS CORNERED

as the beasts approach - they are snapping their jaws and
baring their teeth They know theyve won -- they just dont
want to lunge off the side as they make their play

Gasping from the run bloodied and beaten Zeus considers his
options There are none

Above the sound of the tearing wind and the low growl of the
gathering beasts Zeus hears a terrible hissing inhuman
GROAN rolling out of the islands growth --

HERA (0S)
-- Zeussss --

Zeus looks up to the rocks nearby --

HERA HAS CHANGED INTO A HIDEOUS REPTILIAN CREATURE

that is in the rocks - clearly Cronus last blow She is
toadlike and virtually immobile -- but the eyes tell us it is

Hera Now she too is surrounded by beasts and its feeding
time

HERA
- hellip me --

ON THE ROCKS - ZEUS IS DEVASTATED

but hes powerless -- he cant deal with his pursuers much
less hers Zeus turns to the islands edge and looks down --

-- beneath him the sphere of mystic energy created by Cronus
is churning and crackling like lightning The same energy
that Cronus stripped from him

And a look of realization crosses his face he can still win
He can reclaim his birthright His godhood

Zeus look of fear and defeat shifts to one of acceptance He
gives Hera an oddly peaceful reassuring look --

-- and moves to the edge of the island where he dives off
into the air miles above the earth

Howling and snapping the beasts run to the edge too late to
catch him --

as on her rock Hera begins to cry From where shes
sitting Zeus has just abandoned her and committed suicide

IN THE AIR - ZEUS IS DIVING A THOUSAND YARDS

toward the ball of churning lightning below him -- the wind
is tearing at his face but he shows no fear -- just
determination

Head first Zeus breaks through the barrier -

- and as he crashes through a mesh of lightning the bolts
strike and sear his body -- and it is as physically brutal as
if you or I were hit by multiple lightning bolts --

-- the bolts are stripping the flesh off of him and roasting

whats underneath --—

-- Zeus looks like hes gritting his teeth in determination
but its hard to tell since half his face is torn off --

- strike after strike pinballs Zeus around -- youd swear
the lightning is actually playing with him -- until --

CLOSE ON ZEUS FACE - ONE SEARED EYE OPENS
and whats left of his scorched mouth appears to smile --

ZEUS
Enough -

ZEUS MOVES TO THE CENTER OF THE LIGHTING CLOUD

and hes no longer being tossed around by the storm —- he is
moving himself He has tamed the lightning Zeus suspends
himself in the center and the lightning isnt randomly
striking him any more --

-- he is drawing it in -- its not killing him any more --
now its nourishment Now it belongs to him
ON THE TITANS ISLAND - THE HERA-BEAST IS SURROUNDED

by hungry snarling monsters -- they have driven her against
a wall The bloated thing shes become is almost immobile
but will make a decent meal She looks terrified But as the
reptilian wolf moves in three rows of teeth bared --

--a lightning bolt strikes the beast with surgical
precision -- it ips away smoking and you can smell the

burning scales --

-- the other monsters turn around as does the Hera-beast --
ZEUS RISES OVER THE RIDGE

and there cant be any more doubt -- he is the god of gods
forged in the fire of the sky He looks stronger and more
powerful than ever He is literally rising in a cloud of
lightning -- and he hurls another blast at the retreating
monsters --

-- a couple of monsters spin away burnt by the blast and
the rest run YELPING

With a wave of his hand Zeus cuts out the lightning that
supported him - and he drifts onto the ridge Hera is still
recoiling against the wall a tear welling in one eye

HERA
(a pained rasp)
I -- thought you -- left me --

because of what Ive become

Zeus puts his hand on her hideous face and gently caresses
it

ZEUS
(softly)
Never Not until the end of time

As Zeus caresses Heras horrible face she begins to
change -- from a toadlike monster back to the human stable
girl she once was --

- and finally fully into Hera The radiant goddess of
beauty Hera takes Zeus hand holds it to her cheek and
smiles

ZEUS
Now we must make the future our
own

Our time has come
CUT TO
INT THE UNDERWORLD OF THE DAMNED - THANATOS
is still enjoying his victory over Hades

THANATOS
I never would have dreamt that it
was so easy I never would have
dreamt that you would cling to
your soft worms body and
renounce the vast power that is
your birthright

Shaking Hades kneels at the altar

HADES
I renounce that power and I -- I
renounce that challenge I will be
your servant or your victim at
your whim master so long as you
spare her She has nothing
whatsoever to do with your realm --

Thanatos response BOOMS from every corner -

THANATOS

She is dead and that has
everything to do with this realm
Her torment will last a thousand
milieniums as will yours

(laughs)
Have you any more requests
Myles

Hades looks up He gets to his feet Something in his
expression has changed Hes still afraid but the fear is
beginning to drain away from him

HADES
Just one That you die whimpering

Hades isnt joking Thanatos freezes in anger -- and then
starts LAUGHING A soaking wet hundred pound teenage boy is
telling off the Titan who rules death As he LAUGHS we go

CLOSE ON HADES FACE

Hades makes a decision He leans down to Demeters face --
and desperately passionately kisses her cold blue lips

Thanatos LAUGHTER rumbles everywhere shaking the caverns of
the Underworld - the legions of the dead join in creating
a cacophony of a million demonic laughs

THANATOS
derisive laughter)
Stop -- I beg you O Lord of The
Damned spare me --
Thanatos doesnt realize it yet but --
CLOSE ON HADES - HADES IS FAST BECOMING MORE DEMONIC

as hes locked in a passionate kiss with Demeter -- and color
is returning to her body

Hades is drawing the death out of Demeters body But as he
uses his power to this degree he is cementing his destiny --
he is becoming what he feared what Thanatos is mocking
now he truly is the Lord of the Damned

Demeters eyes flutter open in mid kiss -- she sees Hades
who now looks like a nightmare Nosferatu might have had She
isnt repulsed -- he breaks the kiss off and Demeter sits

up She knows he just gave up his humanity for her Still
weak she touches his face

DEMETER
Myles -- you did this -- for me

Hades expression takes him through an emotional roller
coaster He knows from the way shes touching him that his
face has a monsters contours He knows hes condemned
himself to eternity as a demon But ultimately his face shows
relief and love Whatever hes given up -- he saved her

HADES
(shrugs off his loss)
Never utter that name again I am
Hades
(turns to Thanatos)
I am the Lord of the Damned

Hades waves a hand at the scattered shattered sketeton of
Cerberus -- it not only reforms but Cerberus becomes a full

bodied three headed demon dog the size of a grizzly bear

Hades demonic face splits into a serrated grin If this is
his fate he will enjoy it

HADES
Beg me again Thanatos Beg your
lord and master for mercy that I
shall not grant

Hades lets loose with a blast of magic straight from his
hands that huris Thanatos back against a wall Thanatos is
alive but badly hurt -- and surprised that this kid is not
only his equal he is his superior

Hades hits Thanatos with another blast searing him against

a cavern wall -- he is barely alive as Hades still approaches
HADES
(a coarse whisper)
Beg Me
CUT TO

EXT ISLAND SANDS - POSEIDON IS BURIED

in the sands with all the other debris of the island -- just
a part of him can be seen in the smoothed out sand He is
unconscious at the very least as --

- he begins to rise - a spring of water is pushing up
underneath him taking him from the sand --

- and it steadily pushes him higher until he is thirty feet
up held on the water as if it were a pedestal Poseidons
eyes open -- and he is face to enormous face with

OCEANUS

who is very literally the titan of the seas he is thirty
feet high but could be any size he wants His form is living
moving water -- the outline is that of a man but within him
the water is roiling and shifting in currents His speech is
deep and resonant as if rushing water could form words

OCEANUS
Have you no fight left
(pokes with watery
finger)
Disappointing but predictable
Most men lack the will to fight
or even to live but none more so
than a slave

Oceanus flexes his hand slightly and the spring abruptly
cuts off dropping Poseidon roughly to the ground gasping
and writhing in the sand

OCEANUS
You will not fight -- but I will
grant you a chance for life
(beat)
Bow before me slave

Poseidon weakly looks up at Oceans

OCEANUS
Swear allegiance to Oceanus and
I will permit you to --

POSEIDON
(physically weak but
decisive)

No

Oceanus looks down at Poseidon his watery features taking on
an angry look Hes not accustomed to being refused Oceanus
reaches down with giant hand and grasps Poseidon

- and the hand not only picks up Poseidon it submerges him
Poseidon coughs -- so far weve only seen him hold his
breath not actually breathe water

Oceanus holds his watery fist in front of his face dangling
him by his ankle like a fisherman with a shrimp

OCEANUS
What a miserable puny catch this
is I shall have to throw it back

On the word back Oceanus arm rapidly extends and drives

into the sea taking Poseidon with it --
UNDERWATER - THE WATERY ARM SHOOTS THROUGH THE SEAS

with Poseidon inside -- it is spinning around like one hell
of a riptide and Poseidon is powerless to do anything --

- the arm smashes through branches of coral -- and the
coral rips Poseidons flesh -- blood spirals away from his
body in scarlet pinwheels —-

-- the arm current drives him deeper deeper deeper
toward and down into an underwater chasm --

CLOSE ON POSEIDON - HE IS DROWNING

His eyes are bulging and the thrashing is knocking the air
out of his lungs --

The current smashes Poseidon against a sea cliff -- he

clutches for a grip hanging on as Oceanus current shoves
him back --

Poseidon is afraid -- but he finally realizes that he has to
embrace this change He breathes in the water -- deeply --

- and something changes about him His eyes no longer bulge
in fear -- theyre as calm as the seas as calm as the center
of a storm His lacerations seal up and the blood
surrounding him swirls away

He is not dying But he is changing
ON THE ISLAND - OCEANUS ARM RETURNS TO HIM

and he looks certain that the job is done But he doesnt
notice something --

-- in the waters nearby a wave is rolling in -- and its
building a peak Okay pretty normal so far --

-- but then it builds another peak -- and another and
another until there are five peaks bulging from the crest --

-- and all five peaks lash out into watery tentacles --

all five smash into Oceanus knocking him back against the
rocks in the strongest sucker punch in history --

CLOSE ON OCEANUS

as hes pinned against the rock wall by the full force of the

sea focused on him - the water is blasting the wall into
mud —-

- and abruptly it stops -- the water tentacles drop and
drain back into the sea

Oceanus struggles up as the water drains back -- the sea
level rises and as it does

Poseidon rises with it holding his trident appearing as a
mythic image strong powerful literally in his element
Theres no mistaking it now he is a god

And Oceanus now gets ready for a fight

CUT TO
CLOSE ON HESTIAS WIDE OPEN EYE
She is terrified - she is buried alive Flashes of flame
spark around her body -- you can see hints of it in the metal
shes encased in - but the flames are quickly extinguished

EXT MOUNTAIN PEAK ON ISLAND COEUS

is standing over the dirt and debris that is Hestias burial
mound He seems certain of victory but he really wants to
finish things off

Coeus glides over the top of the dirt and melts into it --
as he descends through the earth the dirt and loose rocks
behind and around him solidify to solid rock

HESTIA SHIFTS AROUND SLIGHTLY

and its useless -- there is very little wiggle room in this
dirt She writhes again in terror and the sound of the metal
brushing dirt changes -- it is now scraping solid stone
Hestias eye darts around in fear - and finds lightly
etched as fluid stone on the wall -- the face of Coeus
COEUS
How long I must wait for another
challenge -- for someone who might

study their enemy first To know
them As I know you little
Chryssa

(beat)
You remember your first burial
dont you When you were a water
girl serving your father as he
worked in the mines of Thrace
Then the tunnels collapsed -- they
dug you out three days later and
he never emerged at all

(face to face)
Ah that twitch tells me you do
remember I was there you know
I made it happen I heard every
scream every plea every whimper
that escaped your lips

COEUS
And your father slowly slowly
died in my embrace then -- just as

you shall now As a goddess I
expect your death to take about
oh ten centuries

Coeus stony LAUGH echoes through the ground he vanishes
up through the now solid stone -- and the stone begins to

move inward crushing Hestia like a giant fist

Hestias look of fear changes She is still afraid -- but she
knows she has to try again As the stone moves in --

- Hestias eye narrows in concentration -- and it
brightens -- capillaries go from blood red to fiery orange --

- and as this tomb begins to GLOW RED and ultimately flares
WHITE HOT we go to --

EXT MOUNTAIN PEAK - COEUS EMERGES FROM THE ROCK

as a part of it He smiles and stretches his arms in
triumph This is still his domain

But Coeus hears a RUMBLE underneath him His stone face
twists in puzzlement He didnt do that Coeus stretches out
an arm touching the earth --

- and he pulls his hand up Its blazing hot and softened
from touching the ground Coeus expression changes --
triumph is slipping away from him

The spot Coeus touched now glows red -- and its starting to
move back into the earth in a growing cavity --

Coeus falls down and has to scramble back to not be drawn
into this -- the fact that this is not his doing and he
cant reverse it seems to scare him more than this shift --

The cavity keeps growing back into the earth from the red
hot center until --

THE NEW VOLCANO ERUPTS

with a fiery salvo of lava that blasts open and seals open
the volcanos top From the fire thats rising up -- in the
shimmering heat --

Hestia rises She is white hot She doesnt look human she
doesnt even look like ordinary fire any more she looks like

she’s somehow formed from the blazing gases of the sun And
she looks angry
110

Coeus scrambles back from the volcanic core He raises a wall
of stone from the ground --

-- and Hestia goes through it as easily as if it were powder
her flames melting a hole in it before she even gets close --

and Hestia flies down to Coeus picking him up and tearing
him away from the earth

HESTIA HOLDS COEUS IN A BLAZING EMBRACE

and he is burning inside her - his expression shows this
time it isnt something he can bounce back from His stone is
melting to slag the slag evaporating to steam --

HESTIA
I think I know you now Coeus You
dont feel so well do you

(beat)
When youre separated from the
earth -- youre much much weaker

arent you

Coeus is SCREAMING -- the powerful stone-against-stone grind
of his voice is becoming a miserable HISS of steam --

HESTIA
Can I take that as a yes

Hestia flies Coeus directly into the vocanos jet of flame --

HESTIA
Then enjoy my embrace Coeus As
a titan I expect your death to
take oh about ten seconds

Hestia flies Coeus up through the flame -- and to her its
soothing and even nourishing -- but Coeus ripped away from
the earth and thrown into this slice of hell disintegrates
within seconds

Now one titan lighter Hestia flies around pausing to look
at the volcano It is blowing flame hundreds of feet into the

air As nearby --
OCEANUS HURLS A WAVE AT POSEIDON

and this is a very unnatural looking wave - water draws up

two hundred feet and it looks as if half the sea is feeding
it --

-- the wave peaks and begins to break over Poseidon --

-- but Poseidon raises his hand and the wave stops - it
holds still fluid but defying gravity —-

-and it disintegrates into droplets -- as the droplets
fall Poseidon waves again and they change into ice --

-- at Poseidons bidding the ice bullets swerve in mid-air
and shoot toward Oceanus -- Oceanus raises his hand to do
something but nothing happens -- the water will no longer do
his bidding

CLOSE ON OCEANUS FACE

as he realizes that the water will do Poseidons bidding not
his He looks like a general whose troops have defected to
the other side in mid-battle What happens physically is no
longer important this is where he realizes that hes lost

The ice bullets slash through Oceanus body with hundreds
of watery entry and exit wounds -- hes not leaking water
but he is full of holes and is clearly almost finished
Poseidon raises his hand -- and-the water rises around
Oceanus As it goes up it creates a cyclonic waterspout
moving up fifty a hundred three hundred feet

Oceanus is swept away spinning madly at the top of it --

Pointing his trident Poseidon waves the spout toward the

nearby erupting volcano --
OCEANUS AND THE WATERSPOUT COLLIDE WITH THE ERUPTION

with explosive results the water instantly vaporizes into
steam --

- Oceanus painfully but instantly is torn apart into a cloud
of steam -- the steam that used to be a Titan is scattered
everywhere as —-

- the volcanic eruption shoots higher and higher -- but the
rest of the waterspout reacts with that cooling the lava as

soon as it fires out --

-- what were watching is thé creation of the tallest
mountain ever seen Were watching the creation of Mt
Olympus

CUT TO

EXT UNDERSIDE OF TITANS ISLAND - LIGHTNING IS STRIKING UP

from the core of the Tartarus cloud -- the metal that juts
out of the bottom of the island is acting like thousands of
lightning rods and the lightning strikes themselves are
tremendously powerful --

-- the strikes are shearing off and annihilating whole
sections of the island while chipping away at the bottom

EXT IN THE WILDERNESS OF THE ISLAND - THE MONSTERS

that dweil here are scattering as the ground itself crumbles
under their hooves -- the reptilian wolves and other
nightmare beasts tumble with chunks of the island and
decononchieres fall too flailing their dozens of hands on
the way down

INT CHAMBER OF TITANS - A WALL IS BLASTED APART
by lightning -- and enter Zeus

ZEUS
Its come Cronus The moment
youve feared the moment you knew
was coming from the day you
overthrew Oranos Your reign is
over Mine has begun

Zeus throws a lightning bolt from his hand -- it sizzles
across the room toward Cronus --

-- but Cronus raises his hand and the bolt freezes before it
hits him -- with some effort he forces the bolt to travel
backwards toward Zeus --

- the bolt backfires on him throwing Zeus back against the
wall of the palace Something about this backfiring has hit

him hard -- as hes reeling against the wall --
CRONUS
Can that really be your best
effort
(beat)

You must do much much better than
that to overthrow a Titan

The walis display changes to a very close up view of the
sun —- and it gets closer and closer until its on the
surface of the sun --

CRONUS
Gods and Titans are elements that
live they are forces of nature

personified You cannot kill me
with a conjurers tricks

Cronus gestures -- and Zeus is shoved through the light wail
and into the core of the sun --

-- Zeus is half in half out of the palace wall and he is
being roasted by the fire -- Zeus would be screaming except
that the heat has ripped the air out of his lungs --

-- and Cronus gestures again taking Zeus back in as if he

were a puppeteer with invisible strings Zeus collapses at
the wall gasping

CRONUS
And nor can I kill you with mine

Taking a scythe down from the wall Cronus walks toward Zeus
who is coughing choking and helpless

CRONUS
We can only kiil each other blood
on blood
(beat)
You used to enjoy wagers I regret
we didnt place one before we
began

zeus is helpless and coughing -- and Cronus raises the scythe
over him As he swings it down -

Zeus reaches up and grabs the handle in mid swing He’s no
longer pretending to cough no Llongér feigning weakness to
get Cronus to come closer

ZEUS
I have a small regret too
(rises)
That my true parents arent here
to see me break you piece by
Piece

Zeus snatches the scythe away from Cronus and tosses it into
the wall -- it vaporizes as it passes into the suns core --

-- and Zeus savagely attacks Cronus He has ascended into
godhood but hes brought along the same street fighting
moves from his pancratium bouts

Cronus is taking some wild biows and hes momentarily

shocked -- how long has it been since anyone even gave him
backtalk much less a real fight But he comes back swinging
powerfully at Zeus --

-- and as only gods can they are drawing blood But Zeus
smiles through a battered face -- and throws his head back in
the same bring it on gesture we saw in the pancratium
fight Strip away the magic and the scale of it and this is
just another bout for Zeus

UNDERNEATH THE ISLAND - THE LIGHTNING STRIKES MULTIPLY

and continues to crumble the island from underneath huge

chunks are falling away and the island ultimately cleaves in
half --

THE TARTARUS CLOUD

is still hurling out the thunderbolts but it is also
collapsing in on itself like a black hole -- as --

WITHIN THE TITANS PALACE - RHEA AND HERA

have been battling but heralding the end of her power Rhea
is rapidiy aging -- she is changing from a cruelly beautiful
woman into a crone

That transformation accelerates as the palace crumbles around
them Rhea has no fight left She just wants to leave Hera
with a little bit of poison on the way out

RHEA

I heard your pitiful tiny prayers
about Zeus

(mocking voice)
Please guide him to love me --
but I know what will transpire in
your future - it is all written
out

(laughing)
Zeus will tire of you Zeus will
decieve you as no woman has ever
been deceived before Zeus will
betray you with goddesses he will
betray you with mortal women and
his infidelities and your
weaknesses will live forever in
tale and song

(beat)
So enjoy your godhood Hera and
cherish your victory

A piece of the crumbling palace almost falls on Rhea -- and
Hera telekinetically holds it up with a gesture She glares
at Rhea --

HERA
Youre wrong We shall write our
own future and build our own
world -- together

With a wave Hera breaks up the ground underneath Rhea -- it
shatters the palace floor and whats left of the island rock
underneath it --

-- Rhea falls through a hole that digs itself deeper the
faster she falls into it --

-- and ultimately she vanishes into the Tartarus cloud

Levitating above the falling rocks and crumbling island Hera
looks down -- Rheas words still trouble her a bit

HERA
to herself)
And if youre right -- then I
shall build a hell for him that
makes yours look glorious

CUT TO
ON THE VOLCANIC ISLAND - HESTIA AND POSEIDON

- get off the island -- Hestia flies up and Poseidon dives into
the water -- because its like a full blown meteor shower
here

IN THE PALACE - ZEUS SWINGS HIS SWORD

at Cronus and Cronus dodges back -- swipe after swipe Zeus
doesnt connect with Cronus --

- but you cant say that Zeus is missing because with each

stroke a Lightning bolt streaks from the sword and blasts
pieces out o palace --

IN THE PALACE - THE WALLS ARE CRUMBLING

and this is not a mere palace of stone it is the universe as
built by Cronus Just as Cronus could turn the walls into
whatever or wherever he wanted each segment breaking off
shows another part of Cronus’ world vanishing - each segment
shows a new monster or evil tearing out of our world
becoming embedded in the walls like a fly in amber and
falling into the void
CRONUS LOOKS AT HIS DREAMS LITERALLY CRUMBLING
His power is sapping away All he has left is anger

Cronus pulls a scythe from a piece of the palace that tears
by and he rushes Zeus Zeus swings up his sword and blocks
the scythe and the two gods are locked in combat as

THE REST OF THE ISLAND COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATES

and it can no longer be called an island -- now its just a

bunch of various sized rocks tumbling toward the Tartarus
cloud

Zeus and Cronus continue to fight on a large rock but their
battle continues without losing any ferocity -- their
clashing sword and scythe knock them from rock to rock as --

THE TARTARUS CLOUD DRAWS IN EVERYTHING

as if it had a strong black hole style gravitational
field -- rocks zoom in end over end -- so do the monsters
trapped in the palace wall segments - and so do the guards
of the island the decatonchieres and other beasts --

-- and oddly the more that is drawn into the cloud the
faster it collapses in on itself -- it is shrinking --

THE LAST CHUNK OF THE ISLAND IS FALLING PAST TARTARUS

and both Zeus and Cronus are on the chunk -- Zeus is off

balance and Cronus manages to sweep his sword away with the
scythe --

Zeus is down and though Cronus is barely hanging on he
vaises his scythe to strike Zeus --

- but theyre now parallel with the Tartarus cloud still
throwing out lightning as it collapses in on itself -- with
a glance and a gesture from Zeus --

-- a trio of lightning bolts burst out of the cloud toward
Cronus -- they strike his scythe and vaporize it and they
surround Cronus like a cage dragging him into the cloud of
Tartarus As Cronus is consumed by the cloud it continues to
collapse inward --

The huge chunk of island continues its fall past the cloud
of Tartarus streaking toward the volcano like a meteor Zeus
gets to his feet completely unconcerned -- a little thing
like this isnt enough to bother a god

Zeus summons a lightning bolt from the skies -- it strikes
parallel to the falling island and keeps pace with it --
il

-- and Zeus leaps from the island and onto the lightnin
bolt -- he rides the lightning down --

- and at this point Zeus is enjoying his godhood -- as he
rides the lightning bolt to the island he hurls smaller

lightning bolts ahead of him at every falling rock in his
path smashing them into powder

Zeus’ lightning bolt terminates on the island and Zeus
dismounts just as it impacts with the island the same
instant as the DEAFENING IMPACT of

-- the last chunk of the Titans island hitting the volcano
top and capping it

Unperterbed by the rain of debris everywhere Zeus raises his
hands some of the debris moves away from him but one
infinitesmal perfect black speck moves toward his finger --

-- the tiny speck lights on Zeus’ fingertip and he holds it
in front of his eye -- we ZOOM TOWARD AND INTO THE SPECK

THE MIGHTY WORLD OF TARTARUS

has been reduced to the size of a dot of pepper and it is
still collapsing inward -- we can see that it is perfectly
black and completely sealed --

-- and Cronus and Rhea are inside tearing at the barriers of

the nightmare msion to try to get out -——

ZEUS (0S

The fates were right Cronus You
shall be destroyed by your own
creations And you were right too
This world youve built is
entertaining —

(beat)
May you enjoy the spectacle for
all eternity

Cronus and Rhea are pulled back inside by the monsters that
populate this micro-dimension -- and WE ZOOM BACK OUT past
Zeus eye which looks like a galaxy at this point --

-- and Zeus blows the dust off his hands Its over

Hera lowers herself gently to Zeus side smiling She looks
improbably beautiful -- even radiant -- for someone who just
rode through a cloud of volcanic dust

Zeus takes Heras hand as she touches ground -- and she
embraces Zeus
She looks at him maybe with a little doubt -- mayne

bit of Rheas taunt ringing
reassuringly and takes her

ent

in her ears But Zeus
in his arms
