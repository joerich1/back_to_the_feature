TITLE SEQUENCE
EXT EUROPEAN VILLAGE - STREET - NIGHT

On a heavily shadowed street two enemy Guards patrol a
tactically important village block Inside the most
prominent building a Party is in progress music wafting
out into the street The two Guards meet at a corner near
the partys entrance one loaning a cigarette to the other
Then they reverse their directions walk apart the Second
Guard disappearing into the darkness of the night Titles
begin

Suddenly Jack Flack everything a spy should be swoops
into view riding a square American-flag parachute down
from a nearby rooftop Red white and blue cut through
the darkness as he lands directly on top of the First Guard

The parachute envelops them both Two bodies thrash within
the silk A moment later Flack steps out glances down the
empty street He wears a pair of tight pants and a beauti-
fully cut brown leather jacket molded perfectly to his
broad shoulders tapering to a tight fit around his slender
waist

He pushes a hidden button on his jacket and with a whoosh
the parachute repacks itself instantly back into the jacket
showing not even a lump

The Second Guard turns around heads back toward the party
building

Jack Flack strolls nonchalantly up to the Second Guard who
challenges him

SECOND GUARD
(in Russian)
Halt Identify yourself

A moment of tension is followed by Jack Flack suavely
responding by pulling out a silver cigarette case getting
out a cigarette

JACK FLACK
(in impeccable
Russian)
Do you have a light

(X) Rev 72283

The Second Guard looks suspicious pumps the action on his
rifle

Jack Flack blows a feather-tufted poison dart from his
cigarette and into the neck of the Second Guard who
instantly stumbles and falls TITLES CONTINUE

An expensive period limo pulls up Out of it steps a
villainous Iranian (with an uncanny resemblance to Khomeini)
arm-in-arm with the lovely Lady Gillingham a voluptuous
Englishwoman They are followed by a fat Soviet diplomat
who carries a thin black briefcase chained to his right

arm

From the shadows Flack makes his move just as the black
bag is passing him he whips out a cord from his Jack Flack
Spy watch with the same action used to start a chainsaw
Indeed he is starting a chainsaw a miniature one Its
tiny but effective blade running from his watch to his
other hand He instantly cuts through the chain grabs the
black bag and the flexible saw retracts back into his
watch

The Iranian lunges at him with a scimitar Flack deftly
kicks the knife high into the night sky then Kung Fu kicks
the Iranian Lady Gillingham draws a Luger from a bra
holsterette fires at Flack who cleverly doffs his
official hat with the shiny bulletproof-steel inner liner
He holds the hat shield between himself and the bullet
causing it to ricochet off and plant itself right between
Lady Gillinghams beautiful eyes

The Russian diplomat pulls one of those bowling ball-type
bombs out of his pocket its fuse already burning He
tosses it at Flack whose spy drill kit presents itself He
instantly drills three holes in the burning bomb inserts
his fingers into it and exhibiting pro bowler prowess
bowls it at the diplomat and a group of soldiers who are
running in pin formation to his aid The bomb explodes
sending them flying

Jack Flack knows enemy reinforcements are on the way so he
ducks around the corner the prized black bag safe in his
hands TITLES CONTINUE

case when suddenly a huge steel gate seems to slam down from
the sky sealing off the alley ahead of him

As Jack wheels and starts back the way he came the earth
rumbles beneath his feet

The source of the rumble becomes immediately clear as two
monstrous twenty-sided brightly colored geometric forms
come rolling around the corner and directly at Flack

Frantically the spy again reverses his direction runs for
his life back toward the newly dropped steel gate

Credits end as Flack seems destined to be crushed by the
frightening geometric boulders

But just then in the nick of time Jack Flack is invisibly
lifted out of the scene

Two men in dark suits Opbst and Haverman stop beside
them also waiting for an elevator Already threatening in
appearance we can see that Daveys imagination is running
wild about them

But then it stops being fantasy as Haverman shoves back
his suit coat and hikes his pants Davey is at eye level
to the mans waist and finds himself staring at a loaded
-38 in a belt holster His eyes widen

Davey tries to get Kims attention to tell her about the

radio aware that he has been shut off by his partner
He looks miffed

From 0S comes a strong resonant male voice

FLACK (0S)
Your friend cut off radio contact
did she

Davey stops sees Jack Flack materialize out of thin air

He looks real and man-sized Hes just as winded as Davey
but hes everything a spy should be at least as a child
would imagine it tall and slender wearing a black turtle-
neck and leather jacket with a bulge under the armpit where
his Walther PPK hangs ready and waiting But it is his

face that is most distinctive Chiseled granite with two
cold pitiless eyes

DAVEY
Oh hi Jack

FLACK
Some people just dont know how to act
on a secret mission Were better off
handling this one on our own

DAVEY
Yeah I guess so

Davey follows Jack Flack up the stairs Both spies draw
their Walther PPKs and proceed

FLACK
This reminds me of my assignment
down in Maracaibo
(pause)

We were surrounded by hordes of
angry mercenariesall I had on
me was my switchblade and a ball
of stringWhats the matter

Flack notices that Davey has lost interest in the story
momentarily The boy is distracted as he notices in

the opposite mirrored building that Jack has no reflection

INT SEVENTH FLOOR LANDING - FIRE STAIRS DAY 12

Davey turns the landing starts up the stairs toward the
eighth floor We no longer see Flack

In the reflection from the building across the way he sees
a struggle taking place in an office on the floor above him
One man breaks away from three others and runs from the room
the others in pursuit

Suddenly the fire door on the landing above crashes open and
a moment later a man Staggers down the stairs toward Davey

Blood stains are blossoming on the mans shirt from a chest
wound He staggers toward Davey

Davey freezes staring up at the dying man Murdoch

02160 12
Rev 8383

Murdoch sees Davey and stumbles to a halt reaching out to
support himself against the boy causing Daveys backpack to
spill much of its contents the lead Jack Flack his soft
ball his bottle of Monster Blood his radio etc Murdoch
stares at the frightened boy He speaks in a death rattle
his eyes burning into Davey

MURDOCH
Help me ---

The boy can only stare at him in horror Murdoch grabs his
shoulder He thrusts a tape cartridge into Daveys hand

MURDOCH
(dying)
Here Whatever happens dont let
them get it They have to be stopped

Davey glances down to find a Donkey Kong game cartridge in
his hand Before he can ask any questions Murdoch speaks
through a cough that flecks the side of his mouth with blood

MURDOCK
Tell the FBI one million two
hundred thirty-seven

The steel fire door bangs open on the floor above Murdoch
glances up fearfully then back at Davey

MURDOCH
(pushing Davey
down the stairs)
Run

Suddenly two silent slugs slam into the dying man They
whip him around and catapult him back first over the stair-
way railing As Davey watches in horror Murdochs body
falls seven flights down the stairwell bouncing off
railings and walls to land with a sickening thud at the
bottom far below

Davey looks up to see where the shots came from Peering
down at him from a railing on the floor above are Haverman
and Opbst the two men from the elevator Opbst has a Luger
with a silencer on it in his hand still smoking He aims
at the boy about to fire

Davey grabs his backpack and whatever spilled items he can
quickly salvage missing the softball He whirls and
plunges down the stairs spoiling Opbsts shot The
killers bound down the steps after him

Daveys attention goes up the stairs as he hears the hollow
sound of one man descending slowly

He looks up to see a Mr Rice coming down the steps Rice is
a trim conservative-looking gentleman in a pristine white lab
coat and necktie He wears a Data Point ID badge on his lapel
He looks oddly peaceful

can be heard The Guard takes Davey by the shoulder

of adults follows all except Mr Rice When he is alone

in their hands getting closer and closer to boarding

He looks around not kndwing what to do if they make it
aboard

Theres no way to run nbthing for him to do except plunge
into the water where hejLl make a slow moving target for
them if they decide to shoot

By the time the frustrated Captain gets the motor started

Opbst and Haverman are aflmost at the head of the line

And finally the last perBon between them and the boat steps

its almost identical to the one Davey grabbed

GEORGE
A simple mistake I asked the boy
to pick up my camera case and he
took the wrong one

Rice slams through the front door behind them and skids to
a halt when he sees Davey with the security Guard and the
nice couple Trying to preserve his anonymity he turns to
walk off toward the distant figures of Opbst and Haverman
The Guard holds up the camera case he took from Davey and
yells at Rice

Rice halts looking like hed like to deny it but thinks

way

GEORGE
Why dont you take the boy to our

very angry the killler listening almost contritely both

widen as the conversation suddenly ceases and the two
exchange camera cages

amused glance at the dispirited boy in the seat beside him

GEORGE
What makes you so sure I gave the
wrong case back

DAVEY
Pardon

GEORGE
(nodding at the
case in Daveys
hands)
Open it and find out

Davey opens the case hardly daring to believe the tape
might actually be there But there it is at the bottom of
the case black and rectangular with that stupid logo on

it Davey whips the tape out flashing George a joyous
smile

DAVEY
You got it

EUNICE

benevolently
at him)

good at making things come out right

He holds the tape out to her She primly removes one of
the gloves she always wears and grasps the tape with her
thumb first and second fingers The other two are
missing Davey stares at the mutilated hand in numb
horror Eunice frowns at the boy

EUNICE
Something wrong Davey

His terror-filled eyes lift to stare at her cold face

He makes a sudden dive over her for the door but George
grabs him and roughly yanks him back down in the seat

hurting him

sprinkles the perfume onto her handkerchief as Davey watches

Davey crouches in the darkness of the tunnel He stares
into the darkness as the spy passes Nearby a rat chirps
and scurries out from near Davey Opbst shoots him Then
there is silence again But Davey now looks around for
other rats that might be surrounding him He turns and
looks along the path There glimpsed for a moment in a
splash of moonlight is Rice

Davey takes a deep breath gulps and suddenly jumps up
shouting and waving his hands

DAVEY
Hey Ricey Whatsamatter Cant

Rices gaze is torn from the path directly ahead of him and
toward the boy in the tunnel All he sees is the kid jumping
around mocking him laughing at him He whips the Schmeizer
machine gun up and fires stitching a line of bullets along
the walk behind the boy slowly catching up to him as Davey
breaks into a run dashing through the tunnel after Opbst

Rice alarmed at the possibility of an accomplice with
Davey instinctively whips his Schmeizer around shoots a
burst of machine-gun fire at the super spy

The pyrotechnics are wild as a mixture of brightly glowing
tracer bullets and standard ammunition flies through
Flacks semitransparent body throwing him back as each
slug enters and passes through his body tearing through
his flesh and clothing then crashing into the wall behind
him It is a spectacular death and it horrifies Davey to
see his friend murdered

DAVEY
(standing
screaming)
No

Davey raises the Luger fires it at Rice the bullet
slamming into the killer right between the eyes
propelling him backward the part of his face which can
still be seen now looking stunned just before the blood
gushes Rice topples into the river and floats away

Davey runs over to where Jack had just been He seems to
have vanished

Jack materializes behind Davey in perfectly good shape
There is no sign of any physical damage Just a little

dust The kind you get playing guns He brushes himself

But it is too late Davey throws it right through Flack
causing it to bounce off the concrete wall and land back
near his feet Davey stomps on it bending the lead

more and more transparent His dying eyes are on Davey
taking a last glance at his friend A sweet sad wistful
smile wreathes his lips and an instant later the super
spy snaps out of existence gone into the night air
forever

Davey cant find the cigarettes and turns back to tell
Flack only to discover he isnt there any longer

Stunned Davey stops crying He looks around wildly
Rices body is there the path and the night are there

of Kim There is none His eye catches a computer screen
overhead listing all the arriving and departing flights

He has no trouble finding Flight to Mexico City

The word Boarding Now flashes on beside it He tears his
eyes away glancing at his watch Five minutes left till
the bomb goes off

He looks up and down the terminal desperately searching
for some sight of Kim

INT TERMINAL - SECURITY CHECKPOINT - NIGHT 145

The MacCreadys have just passed through the checkpoint and
are walking toward the entrance to the boarding area as
Davey skids to a halt before the guards the metal detector
to one side with a waiting line behind it

DAVEY
Pardon me have you seen a girl

He keeps glancing around even as he talks hoping to catch
sight of Kim Suddenly he see the MacCreadys walking with
stately steadiness toward their boarding area Davey
suddenly stops talking pointing at them and shouting

DAVEY
Stop them

The MacCreadys turn and stare at the boy as Davey tries to
dash around the X-ray machine only to be snagged by one of
the guards

Just a second there son

Davey frantically struggles to free himself still pointing
at the MacCreadys who watch him with looks of frozen horror
on their faces

DAVEY
But theyve got the tape ---

GUARD
Im sorry son but you cant pass
through here without being searched
first Who you with anyway

DAVEY
(hopping up and-
down with
frustration)
But the tape ---

GUARD
(pushing
him back)
Now youll just have to go around to
the other side of the metal detector
like everyone else ---

Davey looks at the long line By the time he is searched
and passes through the machine the MacCreadys will be long
gone They know that too and turn to go on their way
Davey watches them go not knowing what to do for a

moment Suddenly he wails at the MacCreadys like some
long lost child

DAVEY
Mom Dad please dont leave me

The MacCreadys freeze again glancing back as the Guard
turns around to look at them They hurry on their way

suddenly wishing they were invisible The Guard turns back
to Davey

GUARD
(bewildered)
They your folks

Davey stands there watching the MacCreadys getting further
and further away

Yes sir and they told me to wait

The Guard suddenly turns and calls loudly after the
MacCreadys

GUARD
Just a minute there folks Would
you mind comin back here

The MacCreadys stop exchanging glances George turns to
the Guard doing his best to smile

GEORGE
But our planes boarding ---

GUARD
Itll wait Lets get this
straightened out first

Holding Davey by the hand he walks him toward the
MacCreadys the couple walking back to meet them

Everybody is now glancing at them curiously They all stop
opposite each other the Guard nodding down at Davey

GUARD

GEORGE
(sarcastically) (Xx)

The Guard looks down at Davey none too pleased

to the camera bag hanging off of Georges shoulder

The Guard looks up at George and holds out his hand

GUARD
Could I see your bag sir

GEORGE
(getting very uncom-
fortable suddenly)
But I assure you officer this boys
lying Weve never seen him before
in our lives

GUARD
Ive still got to see that bag
Now please give it to me

Furious George glowers down at Davey Davey gives hima
huge smile in return Georges eyes snap to the trash can
with his pistol in it on the other side of the metal
detector suddenly wishing he handt ditched it

Suddenly the security office door to the side of the
checkpoint opens and Kim steps out followed by the Chief of
Security and the Guard that originally took her in there
She sees Davey and yells at the top of her lungs

KIM
Davey

He whirls seeing her at the same time They take off on
the run for each other

DAVEY
Kim quick give me the walkie-
talkie ---

George and Eunice glance up All they see is a little girl
rushing toward them followed by two security guards

Thinking theyve been discovered George goes crazy He
smashes the Guard beside him across the chest with his
overnight case slamming the man back against the wall As
the man slumps to the floor stunned George grabs his gun out

of his holster and whips it up pointing it at the approaching
security guards

GEORGE
Stand back

The guards skid to a halt their hands raised just as Davey
meets Kim in front of them

Before she can say anything he rips her backpack off paws
through it and grabs the walkie-talkie He looks around
wildly for somewhere to get rid of the bomb He sees a
door behind the MacCreadys with a glowing Exit sign above
it He vaults the inspection area stand and dashes for it

George reaches out and snags Davey on the way throwing a
choke hold on the boy and using him as a body shield
between himself and the guards yelling at them as he holds
the gun to Daveys head

GEORGE
Now just stay where you are

DAVEY
(struggling to get
free holding up the
walkie-talkie)

George tightens his hold on Daveys neck cutting off his
words and most of his air The boy gasps as hes dragged
backward by George Eunice beside him the gun and the
hostage holding the guards at bay

profusion cf colored wires red green white and blue

the bomb with its impossible profusion of wires sitting on
his small lap the seconds ticking away inside the digital

to go

dressed in his Air Force uniform walks into the plane

slipstream of the speeding jet dragging him back and off

He hits the soft ground at the side of the runway as the

fireball of incredible brightness and size roaring up out
of the blackness The concussion blows Davey back and off

his feet bending the grass and bushes around him almost to
their breaking point

He picks himself slowly up off the ground staring down the
runway at a night that has suddenly become brighter than

climbing into the night sky

He suddenly stops staring into the almost blinding
incandescence of the fireball A tall handsome figure of
aman backlit in burning orange shimmering against the
night sky and the rising fumes of the fire is walking
toward him slowly out of the conflagration

Davey just stares at the apparition watching the glowing
outline of the figure drawing closer and closer to him
something teasingly wonderfully familiar about it

And then he recognizes the figure that jaunty confident
walk the insolent slouch that aggressive lowered curve of
the shoulder

in disbelief)

And now the figure is closer almost recognizableand it
looks just like the super spy everything about him is the
same the walk the carriage even the faint smile Davey
can barely make out on the mans face

enough its Hal Osborne his face smudged with the smoke
of the wreck his hair singed by the fire discheviled and
battered nothing very romantic about him at all Davey
looks at him hard real joy and relief flooding his small

again holding him as tightly as he can
