OVER BLACK WE HEAR A WOMANS TERRIFIED BREATHING

THE SOUND OF HEAVY BOOTS COMING CLOSER FLOORBOARDS CREAKING

A MAN HUMS JINGLE BELLS DERANGED AND OUT OF TUNE
WOMAN’S POV -- As a black cloth bag is yanked off her head

Revealing a smiling almost maniacal SANTA MASK inches away
from her face Plastic bulbous nose stiff beard rosy
cheeks The mask is crooked bent --

The eyes of this CROOKED SANTA dart back and forth from
behind his mask staring at the woman head on His
breathing heavy Aroused

The woman looks down We see her hands are bound with
plastic ties her wrists raw --

Crooked Santa holds a crow bar in one hand a vodka bottle
in the other The woman tries to focus but all she hears
is his demented voice humming Jingle Bells

She tries to call for help but her mouth is taped shut

All around the woman blurry we see other respectable
adults -- their arms and legs bound with plastic ties duct
tape over their mouths They huddle on the floor like
animals

Two other ARMED MEN in similar Santa Masks stand nearby
Surveying the flock

Suddenly one of the bound men JOLTS up and LUNGES at
Crooked Santa The woman’s vision blurs as Crooked Santa
BASHES the bound man with a crow bar each hit harder and
harder still humming that damn song

The other men and women writhe muffled screams all around
as we --

BLACK OUT
SUPER TEN HOURS EARLIER
A JOYFUL VERSION OF JINGLE BELLS PLAYS as morning snow
sprinkles on a park in some New England town Children

build a lopsided snowman

In a suburban neighborhood giant candy canes adorn every
light-post

Storefronts with twinkling Christmas displays open for the
day Passersby rushing past about to do their last minute
shopping
Snow piles on the sidewalk as a boy and girl slide into
their yard on homemade trash can lid sleds They fall into
the snow face first laughing

FADE IN

EXT ALLIE’S MODEST HOUSE - DAY

Silence No Christmas decorations -- though the
neighbors’ lawns are decked out with plastic Nativity
scenes and candy cane jungles

We PUSH in through the window to

INT ALLIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

Walls plastered with band posters surround the massive
stereo system

ALLIE LANGFORD sits with headphones on lost in music
we can’t hear She’s pretty with purple-streaked hair
wearing a Fleetwood Mac T-shirt and old Chucks

A loud KNOCK on the door jostles her from her trance

ALLIE
Yeah

ALLIE’S DAD stands in the doorway eternally pre-occupied
with his Blackberry He’s all business all the time The
space between them might as well be the Grand Canyon

ALLIE’S DAD
Packed yet

ALLIE
Finished last night

Allie keeps her head low Her dad checks another message
barely making eye contact --

ALLIE’S DAD
Be nice to see the guys again
Excited to see Brian

ALLIE
(deflecting)
Shouldn’t we be leaving soon It’s a
long drive
Allie’s Dad’s Blackberry rings

ALLIE’S DAD
(on phone)
Rex-- yeah already on the road

Allie’s Dad turns and walks out of the room She shuts the
door behind him

After a moment she pulls out her CELLPHONE Thumbs
through some texts until she finds SAVED MESSAGES

There must be dozens of them All from BRIAN

Her thumb hovers over the delete button but then she puts
the phone down turning the music back up

INT BRIAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

A frantic morning in a bustling household overly decorated
for the season It looks like Hallmark puked in here

BRIAN MORRISON an All-American jock with blonde hair
and blue eyes stands at the counter sifting through a stack
of mail He’s nervous constantly glancing towards the
hallway

BRIAN’S MOM is busy at the stove whipping up eggs humming
Jingle Bells She’s pretty in a plain way

BRIAN’S MOM
Shane Eggs
(without turning to Brian)
Set the table please

Brian continues to furiously sift through the stack of mail
as his father enters from the hallway BRIAN’S DAD is an
overbearing former jock who runs a chain of sporting goods
stores He’s intimidating and determined to turn his son
into a better version of himself

BRIAN’S DAD
Smells good--
(to Brian)
Egg whites right

Brian finds the large ENVELOPE that he was looking for
RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGN written on the front in big
block letters

In one swift motion he folds it and stuffs it into the
back of his pants as he turns to his dad
BRIAN
It’s Christmas Eve

BRIAN’S DAD
You think USC gives a shit

Brian’s Mom fixes Brian a plate of scrambled egg whites

BRIAN’S DAD
Eat up

SHANE MORRISON Brian’s skinny younger brother enters
head down consumed by a game on his portable Nintendo Ds

Brian’s Dad shakes his head unable to hide his
disappointment

BRIAN’S DAD
Time to unplug

SHANE
What else am I supposed to do in
nowheresville

BRIAN’S DAD
Enjoy the scenery Go for a hike

Shane puts the video game away then shakes his head and
sits at the table Brian nudges him playfully --

BRIAN
(re video game)
I’1l show you how it’s done later

SHANE
Eat your egg whites fool

Brian grabs Shane playfully wrestling him into a headlock

INT TIFFANY’S GARAGE - DAY

Next to a beat-up old car and some rusty tools two teens
make-out And it’s heavy

When they take a breath we see a scruffy ROCKER DUDE and
TIFFANY REESE Tiffany is way too sexy for her age
Flowing hair revealing clothes and way too much make-up

ROCKER DUDE
Can’t you say you’re sick
TIFFANY
Every Christmas my parents like to
pretend they’re rich like their old
college friends I can’t get out of
it Believe me I’ve tried

ROCKER DUDE
But you’re gonna be so far away in
those mountains--

TIFFANY
(leaning in teasing)
And who’s going to keep me warm

The Rocker Dude smiles and moves back in for another round
when the garage door OPENS with a loud CLAAANK Standing
outside is TIFFANY’S MOM If she didn’t look so tired and
annoyed she’d be a beauty Not hard to tell that she was
a former college cheerleader

TIFFANY’S MOM
Dad’s waiting

TIFFANY
I gotta say goodbye to Johnny

Tiffany’s Mom stands there with a condescending look Ina
huff Tiffany gets up and storms towards the door

TIFFANY’S MOM
(as Tiffany walks by)
And put a jacket on

Tiffany keeps walking Her mom shakes her head and just as
the Rocker Dude moves for the door she closes it right in
his face

EXT JJS PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

Pacing on the terrace of a high-rise condo in the heart of
downtown Boston is JJ CHENG a good-looking Asian kid
wearing a private school uniform flipping through a stack
of hundreds while hustling on his Blue-Tooth

JT
(on phone)
It’s Hova and Kanye at the Garden
Backstage-- I don’t care auction to
the highest bidder I can’t I’m
gonna be at one of my properties-—-
just start the bidding at eight
JJ snaps off his Blue-tooth as his blonde-haired step-dad
REX MORRIS (40s) opens the patio door and approaches

JT
Yo Rex--

REX
Making deals

JT
Always

REX
Your mom’s almost ready

JIT
She complaining yet

REX
For the last hour

JJ smiles

JIT
Still glad you married her

Now Rex smiles

REX
Can’t get rid of me that easy

SARAH (0S)
We going or not

Enter SARAH CHENG (40s) Wrapped in a fur coat and
designer duds she seems a bit distant but there’s warmth
somewhere under that ice

SARAH
One call to dad and we could all be
having Christmas dinner in Palm
Springs or Cancun again--

REX
I really want to show our friends the
place It took a lot for your folks
to trust me with my first property

JT
I dig Rosewood It’s creepy--

SARAH
There’s no landline no cellphone
service--
eres
(playfully mocking her)
No butler-- no foot massages while
you eat caviar and gargle Moet

Sarah can’t help but crack a small smile as Rex leans in
and holds her hand

SARAH
Let’s get this party started then

Rex gives her a thankful kiss as they head inside

REX
This is gonna be great--

EXT BRIAN’S HOUSE - LATER

In the driveway of their upscale house the SUV is fully
packed for their trip Brian’s Dad and Mom wait by the
vehicle anxious to leave Shane’s in the backseat
secretly playing his Nintendo game when Brian exits --

BRIAN’S DAD
Lock it up

Brian turns and makes sure the door’s locked before he
jumps into the backseat of the SUV

Brian’s Dad pulls out of the driveway while Brian settles
in the back seat He puts his headphones on then flips
through some of his TEXT MESSAGES

Dozens of SENT MESSAGES but no replies

All of them to ALLIE

He swipes to his playlist and a soft melancholy song
begins It plays over the following

MONTAGE --

Where we see all the families driving deep into the
mountains snow covered forest for miles
EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD - EVENING

The sun sets over the pine trees casting an orange haze
over the freshly falling snow

After a moment Allie and her Dad’s SEDAN pulls into
view moving slowly as it struggles up this slippery pass

INT ALLIE’S SEDAN - SAME

Allie’s Dad drives white-knuckled eyes focused on the
ever-narrowing road Allie sits in the passenger seat
studying the empty landscape

A local radio weather report talks about a massive snow
storm headed for SUMTER COUNTY

ALLIE
Mom would love it up here Remember
in Park City when she insisted on
going down that crazy black diamond
run a million times

ALLIE’S DAD
Should be right over this hill

Allie shakes her head and sits back as more snow falls

They finally manage to crest the hill but the car SLIPS on
the ice swerving--

Allie grips the passenger side door as her Dad turns the
wheel gaining control of the car again They spot a turn-
out up ahead with a tattered WOOD SIGN that reads
“ROSEWOOD LODGE”

EXT ROSEWOOD LODGE - EVENING

What once was a luxurious New England mountain resort looks
more like a rundown mansion in the middle of nowhere

The MAIN BUILDING is three-stories high completely
constructed of wood that has long since become brittle and
cracked Some sections stick out at odd angles Around
back we see a frozen pond and some smaller dilapidated
sheds scattered about

Snow picks up as Allie’s Dad parks the car next to a row of
other cars

Allie steps out of the car the wind KNOCKING her back and
fiercely swaying the tree branches above her She spots
Rex and JJ hanging a string of Christmas lights above the
front door

REX
You made it

ALLIE’S DAD
Barely

REX
I checked the forecast Heavy stuff
won’t touch us But we gota
snowmobile if you need to run to town
and buy some panties

With a big smile Rex wraps Allie’s Dad in a massive hug
right before they jump into their old complicated
fraternity handshake like a couple of college kids --
ending with a chest bump

REXALLIE’S DAD
FOR LIFE

JJ and Allie scoff from the side

JI
I’1l never get use to seeing that
ALLIE
Still scamming freshman for lunch
money
JI

Love the hair Sort of Lady Gaga
meets Snookie You’re afraid of an
actual color found on Earth

ALLIE
Fear is my defining characteristic

JT
Hardly

JJ and Allie smile It’s obvious these two are good
friends

REX
JJ-- show Allie to her room

JT
Yes sir new-dad

ALLIE
“New dad”

As JJ walks by Rex grabs him and they playfully wrestle
for just a second

REX
(to Allie’s Dad)
Come on-- everyone’s in the back
grabbing drinks

Rex and Allie’s Dad head inside as JJ and Allie follow

JIT
Youre gonna love this place-- it
reminds me of you Weird

Now Allie grabs him and they smile --

INT MAIN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They enter the massive foyer of the lodge decked out with
last minute Christmas decorations It’s a cavernous space
lined with deep mahogany wood panels Giant oak beams run
the length of the ceiling A set of staircases branch off
and lead up to the second story

REX
Welcome to Rosewood

Everything about this lodge is a bit “off” The angles and
levels seem just a bit tilted different colors of stain
and wood clash even the design and architecture of each
section don’t quite gel It’s an oddity of craftsmanship
A Frankenstein of buildings

ALLIE’S DAD
You got yourself a real fixer-upper
here Rex

REX
Laugh away but in the early 20s
this lodge was an upscale ski-resort--

JIT
Gangsta’s paradise--

REX
(off Allie’s Dad’s look)
“New-son” speaks the truth

REX (CONTD)
Bootleggers used this place as a
stopover when they ran shipments
through the mountains There’s been
so many owners JJ and I are still
discovering all the secrets built
into these walls

ALLIE’S DAD
Not exactly the typical Cheng
property

REX
Want to bet
(off Allie’s Dad’s look)
I convinced Sarah’s parents and by
the end of the weekend I’1l1 convince

you too
JT
(to Allie)
Come on--

JJ leads Allie upstairs

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

JJ and Allie walk down a narrow corridor lined with dozens
of thin doors and antique furnishings The hallway forks
in two and they walk to the right where it almost
immediately forks again It’s a maze

ALLIE
Glad my phone has GPS

eres
Good luck getting reception

They continue to walk

ALLIE
So uh everybody’s here

JJ knows exactly what she’s asking

JT
You and the pretty boy on the outs

ALLIE
I thought you were the pretty boy

JJ smirks

ALLIE
(lying)
Besides I’ve moved on

JT
Too bad You guys were interesting
together in a Peanut Butter and Mayo
kinda way

JJ rounds another corner Allie tries to keep up She
turns the same corner and enters another long hallway but
JJs gone

ALLIE
JJ

Completely confused Allie scans the area No doorways
nearby or closets or stairs He literally just
disappeared

ALLIE
JJ

Allie walks forward slowly but there’s still no sign of
him

Suddenly a section of the wall slides over to reveal a
passageway that leads into a dark space between the walls
about two-feet wide

JJ stands there with a grin on his face

JIT
Told you this place was weird

Intrigued Allie checks out the claustrophobic secret
corridor It seems to go on forever Dank and dusty

JIT

There are passages like these
everywhere Must’ve been for the
gangsters to hide and get around
There’s even a bunch of old mining
crap in the basement

(off Allie’s look)
I know random And check this out --

JJ walks ahead and uses all his strength to slide over a
heavy table revealing an opening near the floor It’s a
hidden MINI-FREIGHT ELEVATOR with a grated door -- big
enough for a few crates of whiskey

JT
Booze could go right down to the
first floor

ALLIE
Convenient

JIT
Come on-- your room’s over here--

INT ALLIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

JJ leads Allie into the small guest room He sets down her
bags as she settles in

JT
We better hurry before Shane eats all
the food

ALLIE

Be down in a minute

JT
I get it You wanna freshen up for
the big reunion--

ALLIE
(as if she’s insulted)
I gotta use the bathroom

JJ gives her a little look

JIT
I’1l tell him you’re coming

JJ exits As soon as he’s gone Allie moves to the mirror
and regards herself checking her hair and make-up She
takes a deep breath

INT BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

Strings of Christmas lights a giant pile of presents and
a large evergreen tree aren’t enough to hide the decay of
what used to be an opulent dining area complete with
thirty-foot ceilings stone fireplace brick columns and
EXPOSED WATER PIPES

Everyone mingles eating Christmas cookies drinking wine
and laughing about stories from college and past trips

There’s JJ and his parents Rex and Sarah Brian Shane
Tiffany her mom and TIFFANY’S DAD
who we haven’t met yet
Christmas sweater and wire-rimmed glasses It’s obvious
that he does not wear the pants in that family

and their parents

He’s a slight man wearing a dorky

The conversation seems to be mostly about the lodge and
Sarah’s wealthy parents THE CHENG’S We catch a bit of it
as Brian moves towards the snack table

SARAH

ALLIE’S DAD

My parents were against it-- Rex can be very persuasive--

BRIAN’S DAD

REX

Bastard won’t take no for an
answer-- especially if it’s a You still owe me for that--

Patriot’s bet-—-

BRIAN’S MOM
(to Sarah)
It’s very unique--

REX
I’m telling you-- when
done with this place--

ALLIE’S DAD
There’s potential--

SARAH
JJ likes it-- sort of nice
for him and Rex to come up
here --

BRIAN’S DAD
It’ll be a damn money pit--

REX
Thank you

TIFFANY’S DAD
Potential to go broke--

REX
That’s it-- everybody outta my house

BRIAN’S DAD

Technically it’s her house

REX
Ouch--

They continue to laugh and joke In the corner Brian
talks to Tiffany while Shane keeps playing video games

TIFFANY

It’s like we’re in the cold version

of hell

BRIAN
It ain’t that bad Plus Dad could
use a vacation-- he just opened
another store in Lewiston

TIFFANY
My mom’s been working like crazy
too Doing these nursing conferences
every other weekend She’s terrified
of leaving me alone-- thinks I’m
sleeping with the whole town

BRIAN
Aren’t you

TIFFANY
Just half I leave the ladies to
you

BRIAN

What would your mom say if she knew

TIFFANY
Can’t all be perfect like her--

JJ (0S)
Youre perfect to me

JJ saunters over and goes right for Tiffany Sort of
charming in an awkward way Tiffany scoffs

JIT
This is the year we finally get this
thing going

TIFFANY
“Thing”

JT
The attraction-- the sexual chemistry
that bubbles between us I’m heating
up can’t you feel it

TIFFANY
I feel sick does that count

Brian can’t help but smile as all the parents suddenly stop
their conversations and turn to the entry way where Allie
stands stunning in a classic black dress and boots

She keeps her head low as she enters and all the parents
say their “hellos” and “you look so pretty’s”

Brian is transfixed But Allie stays on that side of the
room far away from him

JJ and Tiffany can see the tension

TIFFANY
(re Brian’s staring)
Lust much

Brian snaps out of it

Shane takes a minute from his video game and shakes his
head at his brother’s plight

SHANE
Just talk to her

BRIAN
If I want to I will--

JIT
Man you are officially in the
doghouse

Brian stares at Allie across the room Debating

INT BANQUET ROOM - LATER

Everyone is still in party mode eating drinking singing
terrible versions of Christmas carols But in the corner
it’s Allie and Brian He finally walked over

BRIAN
Hey

Allie doesn’t even look at him She stares out the window
through the trees and falling FLURRIES of snow where in
the distance she spots the faint figure of a man wearing a
SMILING SANTA MASK Allie leans in trying to get a better
look

BRIAN
You look nice

Allie glances Brian’s way and then out the window again
searching for that mask but all she sees is nature She
turns her attention to Brian

BRIAN
You didn’t text me back

ALLIE
I lost your number

Brian’s Dad sees Brian and Allie talking alone and frowns

BRIAN’S DAD
Brian Stop moping in the corner
Come join us

A tense moment

Allie walks away just as Brian reaches out to stop her
He’s interrupted by Rex who’s in the middle of the room
corralling everyone together --

REX
(looking at his watch)
Alright come on-- you know what time
it is

Tiffany groans loudly They all know what’s coming

REX
Time for a little game of hide and
seek

ALLIE

I think I’m gonna sit this one out--

BRIAN
I second that

SHANE
Me three

TIFFANY’S MOM
Oh come on it’s tradition

SHANE
A tradition that started when we were
losers who thought hide and seek was

fun
JIT

Let’s just play ‘Tis the season
REX

You know the rules Kids have to a
hundred to hide then the parents
have an hour to find them

ALLIE
Dad come on--

ALLIE’S DAD
(ignoring her as usual)
If we win kids are on clean up
duty for the whole trip

TIFFANY
And if we win we never play this
stupid game again
Tiffany’s Mom gives her a little look of disappointment

BRIAN
Let’s do it then

As the parents begin counting the kids reluctantly walk

off in separate directions Brian tries to follow Allie
but she hurries away from him

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER

Brian enters the living room and finds JJ standing by a
GRANDFATHER CLOCK against the wall

BRIAN
You seen Allie

JT
I’ve got my own lady to find

BRIAN
Don’t think she’s in there

JJ turns and smiles then PUSHES the clock It’s ona
creaky wheel system and slides over to reveal another
cramped passageway inside the walls

JT
Adios

JJ enters the wall and the CLOCK slides back into place

Brian just stands there for a moment dumbfounded

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER

Allie is alone walking down a narrow hallway towards the
back of the lodge It’s quiet and eerie

The boards below her feet CREAK as she moves
Something STIRS behind her

She turns but there’s nothing there

ALLIE
You’re supposed to count to a
hundred

No reply Allie shakes it off and keeps walking turning
corner after corner in this labyrinth until she enters --

INT TRIANGLE ROOM - SAME

-- which is empty save the desk and a couple of large
PAINTINGS on the wall

There’s something odd about the way one of the frames
hangs

Just as Allie reaches her hand up to touch it --
A HAND GRABS her shoulder
Allie screams and turns to find Brian standing there
ALLIE
(still freaked out)

Are you following me

BRIAN
You can’t be mad forever

Allie takes a moment to catch her breath
ALLIE
You obviously don’t know me very

well

Brian shakes his head frustrated Then he notices the
way the PICTURE FRAME is hanging crooked

He walks past her and grabs the frame tilting it away from
the wall to reveal part of a RUSTED METAL DOOR with a lock
at its center

Brian and Allie exchange a look before Brian opens the door
and peaks inside

INT SMALL BRICK HOLDING ROOM

Allie and Brian walk tentatively into the cramped area but
there’s no windows doors furniture nothing

Brian smiles mischievous

BRIAN
You know what I think this is

Allie inspects the wall a bit closer and is horrified to
see what look like frantic FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES

ALLIE
Some kind of cell

BRIAN
More like the perfect hiding place

Brian SWINGS the door closed All we see is Allie’s
alarmed face as the door SLAMS SHUT

INT KITCHEN - SAME

Tiffany sneaks a beer from the fridge when she hears a
slight TAPPING sound

It’s hard to make out but there’s something there

She stops to listen TAP TAP Like it’s coming from
behind the wall

Tiffany walks over and puts her ear next to a tall SHELVING
UNIT made of wood panelling when --

WHAAAAAAM 1

Something SLAMS into the wall and makes Tiffany jump back
alarmed

Then the shelving unit opens to reveal JJ

JT
That was way too easy--

TIFFANY
You’re a dick

JT
You can’t hide in here Come on--

JJ grabs her hand and drags her down the hallway towards
the stairs

INT SMALL BRICK HOLDING ROOM - SAME

Allie pulls out her cellphone and lights up the display
screen revealing her panicked face She searches for the
door handle Brian instantly looks sorry

ALLIE
Why would you do that

BRIAN
The handle’s right here It was a
joke

Allie pushes down on the handle releasing them back
into

INT TRIANGLE ROOM - SAME
Allie steps away from Brian

BRIAN
(apologetic)
So that didn’t go as planned

ALLIE
You sure know how to romance a girl

Her eyes fall on another one of the CROOKED MURALS and she
pulls it back to reveal a DARK HALLWAY filled with cobwebs
and dirt

BRIAN
Now this is the perfect spot

ALLIE
Have fun with that

BRIAN
Scared

Allie stares Brian down then moves past him and enters the

narrow corridor disappearing into the shadows Impressed
Brian follows her into the darkness

INT JJS ROOM - LATER

Tiffany sits on the bed bored while JJ rummages through
one of his suitcases

TIFFANY
I thought we were going to hide

JIT
We need supplies--

BAAAAAAM

From out of nowhere a hi-tech RADIO-CONTROLLED CAR slams
into JJs foot He jumps back pissed --

JT
Ow shit

Shane stands in the doorway REMOTE CONTROL in hand smirk
on his face

SHANE
Sorry--

JJ grabs the car and REMOTE from Shane --

JI
Get outta here

SHANE
This place sucks I need to
entertain myself--

JI
Go somewhere else

SHANE
Lame

Shane pulls out his Nintendo and goes back to playing a
video game as he walks out of the room

JIT
(to Tiffany)
Ready for a date with destiny

TIFFANY
I know your family’s like a bunch of
billionaires and they always get
what they want-- but you’re not
getting this

JJ smiles at the challenge --
JI

We’re successful for a reason-- we
don’t take no for an answer

TIFFANY
Not gonna happen--

JJ lifts his hand to show Tiffany what he found inside his
suitcase A JOINT

Tiffany takes a moment then slightly grins

INT NARROW CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Brian and Allie move slowly through the space which
becomes tighter and more cramped Their feet kick up dust
and grime as the light continues to fade

ALLIE
Are the walls closing in or is it
just me

BRIAN

It has to lead somewhere

ALLIE
We should go back

Allie claws through some cobwebs but Brian still pushes
ahead They hear a strange SCRATCHING sound

ALLIE
What was that

They both stop Silence Allie takes another step There
it is again

A long moment More SCRATCHING Allie breathes heavy as
the sound echoes around them

Allie backs away freaked out when a FAT RAT scurries in
front of her

She JUMPS as the rat darts into a small crack in the wooden
walls

They each take a deep breath then can’t help but laugh
Their eyes connect briefly -- the spark’s still there

ALLIE
Is that another door

The moment is broken Brian and Allie venture towards
another door Behind it are stairs that lead down into

INT ROOM UNDER LIVING ROOM FLOOR - SAME

It’s just a small space under the floorboards The ceiling
is only about six feet high Through a small crack they
can see directly into the living room

BRIAN
They’1l never find us in here

They both lean against the wall
A long awkward moment then

BRIAN
You ever hear from your mom
(no reply)
How long’s it been since she left

It takes Allie a moment but she finally answers

ALLIE
One year two months six days
Who’s counting though

BRIAN
Your dad still always working

Allie shrugs

BRIAN
Remember when we used to talk about
this stuff

ALLIE
Remember when you weren’t an asshole

She cringes That came out harsher than she intended
Brian takes a moment recovering

BRIAN
It’s cool I deserve that
(beat still trying)
Maybe it’s good your dad doesn’t bug
you Mine won’t let up He’s
obsessed with me getting that stupid
swim scholarship

Brian glances at Allie again It almost seems like she’s
going to say something but then she turns away

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

JJ opens an old door to reveal a dank STAIRCASE that leads
up to the darkness of the attic He FLIPS on a light and
an old fluorescent BULB flickers to life

TIFFANY
If you try anything--

JT
Ill be a perfect gentleman

Tiffany gives him a look then climbs up JJ takes a
moment to admire her backside as he follows her up the
stairs

TIFFANY
I can feel your eyes

Suddenly JJ FALLS through one of the broken steps He
steadies himself regaining his balance

TIFFANY
Smooth

JJ looks below the broken step where he can see a cracked
plaster floor which is the ceiling to the room below

JT
Maybe we shouldn’t go up

TIFFANY
Youre pussying out
JJ looks to the top of the stairs as Tiffany turns A bit
sweaty hair a mess she looks sexy-as-hell waiting up
there for him --

JT
No ma’am

Tiffany shakes her head in disgust as JJ climbs up --

INT ROOM UNDER LIVING ROOM - SAME
Brian continues to plead his case to Allie
BRIAN

I should have called after-- I wanted
to-- I mean Cancun was amazing and--
ALLIE
Message received You got what you
wanted

BRIAN
It wasn’t like that All that stuff
I said I meant it It’s just when
I got home--

ALLIE

Three weeks That’s how long I
stayed in my room waiting for you to
call My dad thought I had mono

And believe me the fact that he
noticed stop-the-presses huge

BRIAN
I’ve been trying to text you

ALLIE
Too little too late

Above them in the living room they hear someone enter and

their conversation is interrupted

Allie stands up and peeks through the ceiling into

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

It’s Brian’s Dad and Tiffany’s Mom They’re walking
on top of them oblivious

BRIAN’S DAD
You look great

He turns to Tiffany’s Mom A small smile

TIFFANY’S MOM
We should try upstairs

BRIAN’S DAD
I miss our little trips

TIFFANY’S MOM
Don’t

BRIAN’S DAD
I’ve got a store opening next month
You can go to another conference

Brian’s Dad moves in close

right

TIFFANY’S MOM
Not here

He grabs her seductively

BRIAN’S DAD
Where

She smiles a bit --

INT ROOM UNDER LIVING ROOM - SAME

Riveted Brian maneuvers to get a better look as his dad
KISSES Tiffany’s Mom

Brian can’t believe his eyes He falls back and sits
Stunned

Allie shifts beside him not sure what to say

INT ATTIC - SAME

The entire floor is made up of rotted wood Boxes and junk
crowd the space though there’s tarp and power tools along
one wall -- signs of a renovation

JJ and Tiffany carefully walk around a GAPING HOLE that
peers thirty-feet down into the banquet room below --

TIFFANY
Place is a death trap

After a precarious little journey they find a corner of
reinforced plywood to sit on JJ moves a few old pieces of
clothing and gets comfortable

TIFFANY
Are we gonna smoke or what

JJ lights up the little joint and takes a puff

JIT
(handing it to Tiffany)
Sure you can handle this It’s
medical grade--

Tiffany grabs the joint takes a massive puff and blows a
perfect smoke ring into JJs face
JT
God I love you

TIFFANY
Shut up

Tiffany hands JJ the joint as they both settle in

TIFFANY
What’s up with this shithole anyway

JT
It’s not a shithole

TIFFANY
You actually like him don’t you

JT
Rex Yeah He brings me up here
sometimes to help When he was a
foreman before he married my mom he
kept beggin’ my grandparents to buy
into this place After they got
married they finally did He’s
gonna fix it up and sell it for a ton
of dough

TIFFANY
How long’s he been working on it

JJ takes another puff --

JI
Long time

TIFFANY
Still looks like a shithole to me

JJ can’t help but laugh Then he starts COUGHING And
that makes Tiffany laugh

INT ROOM UNDER LIVING ROOM - SAME

Brian hasn’t moved He just sits there as his dad and
Tiffany’s Mom finally walk out of the room above their
heads

BRIAN
After all the shit he gives me-- what
a prick

ALLIE
They’re parents They’re supposed to
be pricks

Then -- there’s a KNOCK on the front door Allie and Brian
stand up trying to get a peek at who it is but it’s hard
to see everything through the cracks in the floor

ALLIE
Shhhh

FROM ALLIE AND BRIAN’S POV -- they watch as Brian’s Dad
walks back into the LIVING ROOM and moves for the door

He peeks outside through the peep-hole
TIFFANY’S MOM
(reentering)
Who is it

BRIAN’S DAD
Can’t see

Another gentle rap on the door Just as Brian’s Dad turns
the handle --

WHHAAAAAAAAAAAMMMM

The door BURSTS inward --

KNOCKING him to the floor

Before Tiffany’s Mom can even scream
TWO MEN IN SANTA MASKS

BARGE INTO THE ROOM -- GUNS IN HAND They wear blue-collar
jeans and jackets as a gust of WIND and SNOW swirls inside

All we can make out are those MASKS -- smiling perpetually
jolly -- even as the larger of the two men SHOVES Tiffanys
Mom to the ground ripping her shirt her hands scraping on
the floor

We don’t see the faces underneath the masks but the large
quiet man we’ll come to know as SPENCER

And the one in charge That’s MALCOLM

Brian’s Dad tries to defend Tiffany’s Mom until Spencer
RAMS his pistol into his head

Completely in shock Brian and Allie can do nothing but
watch from under the floor as the parents are manhandled
and pushed around

Brian has to put a hand over Allie’s mouth so she won’t
scream

MALCOLM
(to Brian’s Dad)
Where are they

Malcolm leans into Brian’s Dad’s ear Menacing

MALCOLM
Where

BRIAN’S DAD
Where what

Spencer ELBOWS Brian’s Dad in the back of the neck Before
Brian’s Dad can reply Malcolm hears some laughter in the
other room Spencer follows the laughter dragging Brians
Dad as Malcolm pushes Tiffany’s Mom towards the kitchen

Under the floor Brian and Allie are still frozen in
disbelief

Brian hurries back down the corridor Allie follows

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Brian and Allie quietly exit the hidden doorway behind the
painting and creep down the hall towards the kitchen

A second after they dart through another door Malcolm and
Spencer walk by mere feet away with Brian’s Dad in tow

Brian motions for Allie to follow as they sneak towards

INT KITCHEN - SAME

The rest of the parents including Rex and Sarah drink
glasses of red wine

SARAH
Shouldn’t we be looking for the kids

ALLIE’S DAD
Why would we do that

A brief moment of laughter when without warning Malcolm
and Spencer still wearing their smiling Santa Masks blast
into the room with their guns waving

Malcolm throws Tiffany’s Mom who’s now SOBBING into the
center of the room as Spencer rounds the rest of the
parents up like cattle

REX
Who are you people

ALLIE’S DAD
What do you want

BRIAN’S DAD
Money

Rex holds tight to Sarah Tiffany’s Dad makes a run for
it but Spencer FIRES his gun into the cabinets

Everyone goes deathly still Brian and Allie stay hidden
in the hallway watching everything

Malcolm looks at Sarah and moves towards her He nods to
Spencer --

REX
No-- don’t--

Malcolm grabs Sarah --

REX
NO

Rex PUSHES Malcolm back fighting with every ounce of his
strength but Malcolm SMASHES him in the face with the butt
of his gun Rex falls to the ground nose bleeding --

SARAH
Rex

BRIAN’S DAD
Leave him alone

Malcolm waves his gun again even more menacing --

Rex staggers to his feet as Spencer starts binding each of
the parents’ hands with plastic ties

SARAH
I’1l go with you-- just don’t-- my
parents-- they’1ll pay--

MALCOLM
Yeah We know

Just as Malcolm and Spencer have their backs turned Brian

and Allie are able to sneak away moving quietly up the
stairs

INT SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

On the far end of the lodge Allie and Brian tread
carefully down another long hallway careful not to make
too much noise

Allie breathes hard barely able to keep it together as
Brian steps ahead on the lookout --

ALLIE
What’re we gonna do

BRIAN
We gotta find the others

As they’re about to turn the corner there’s a NOISE up
ahead

Brian and Allie hide behind the opposite wall as the noise
moves closer

Tears stream down Allie’s face -- still fighting panic
Someone’s coming
ALLIE
(whispering to herself)

Thiscantbehappening

Brian scans the room then grabs a LAMP from a nearby
table holding it like a weapon

ALLIE
Brian-- don’t--

Brian puts a finger to his lips Be quiet

They both wait for an excruciatingly long moment holding
their breath as someone moves closer

Finally

Just as the person arrives Brian JUMPS out about to take
a ferocious swing --

JI
Whoa whoa

It’s JJ and Tiffany and they’re both baked out of their
minds

TIFFANY
What’s your problem

ALLIE
(frantic)
There’s these guys-- downstairs--
they have guns--

eres
Yo chill out --

BRIAN
They broke in-- they’re here for your
mom-—

TIFFANY

(to JJ)

Your mom’s hot What went wrong with
you

ALLIE

We have to do something --

BRIAN
Where’s Shane

JT
What are you talking about

BRIAN
They’re gonna kidnap your mom for
ransom--

JT

Dude you are high I’m gonna grab
some chips --

TIFFANY
Oooh munchies

JJ and Tiffany giggle

BRIAN
Listen They’ve got our paren--

But JJ and Tiffany just keep walking down the stairs

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

JJ and Tiffany make it down the stairs and into the large
living room when Brian grabs him from behind and PUSHES JJ
against the wall with brute force

JI
What the hell bro--

BRIAN
Goddamnit JJ--

TIFFANY
Let him go--

BRIAN

Listen to me These men have guns
They have our parents We need to
find Shane--

ALLIE
We shouldn’t be down here--

TIFFANY
This is so not funny anymore--

JJ breaks free from Brian’s grasp when they hear commotion
in the other room and Malcolm’s voice loud and gruff
JJs eyes widen attempting to comprehend

JI
Who the hell’s that

BRIAN
Now you believe me

ALLIE
What do we do

BRIAN
We get Shane and get out of here
Find the police

Brian and Allie push a startled JJ and Tiffany towards the
front door when it starts to open Someone else is coming
in

Stuck between the front door and the kitchen they dive
behind a large CABINET in the nearside entry way

The front door slowly opens and we see a PAIR OF BLACK
BOOTS step inside crusted with ice

Standing there is a thin spindly man a frantic energy
about him He clutches a CROW BAR in his grime-covered
hands and wears another SANTA MASK but his is dirtied and
bent Beneath the mask we can still make out his crazed
drug-fueled eyes and jagged stained teeth

This is FINN

Malcolm and Spencer drag Sarah in from the kitchen They
hold her still and duct tape her mouth shoving a black
cloth bag over her head

FINN
That her

Malcolm PUSHES Sarah towards Spencer furious

MALCOLM
You were supposed to wait--

FINN
Screw that You’ve been taking your
sweet time

MALCOLM
Pull up the car--

FINN
Can’t

MALCOLM
What do you mean-- you can’t

Finn walks to the refreshments table perusing the alcohol
finally settling on a Christmas inspired vodka jug

FINN
We’re stuck

He uncorks the vodka as Spencer and Malcolm exchange a
glance Malcom rushes to the window He opens it to see
nothing but WHITE Finn’s piece of shit truck’s barely
visible half-covered in snow

MALCOLM
Wasn’t supposed to hit for the next
two days

FINN

That’s the thing about weather
Shit’s unpredictable

Spencer distraught keeps looking out the window as the
snow falls

FINN
Them’s the breaks big boys Could
be a few hours or more till it
passes

Malcolm cracks his knuckles a nervous tic

MALCOLM
Bring the rest of them here --

Spencer doesn’t move still staring at the snow Still not
saying a word

MALCOLM

Do it

Finally Spencer tilts his head sizing Malcolm up
There’s a tense beat but then Spencer exits Finn takes a
seat kicking his feet up fiddling with that crow bar

MALCOLM
You leave it to me Understood

FINN
(flashing a smile)
Yes sir boss

BEHIND THE CABINET --

JJ and Tiffany are in complete shock they can’t believe
what’s happening fifteen feet in front of them

Brian motions for them all to stay down and stay quiet

INTERCUT

IN THE LIVING ROOM --

Spencer re-enters with the parents in tow They’re all
bound by plastic-ties scared

Rex and the others continue to plead with the masked men --

REX
Please-- just let us go--

BRIAN’S DAD
We won’t say anything-- just leave
now before something bad happens--

Finn laughs hard This makes the parents stop

FINN
You fools are doing this all wrong

He grabs the extra plastic ties and roughly binds Tiffanys
Moms feet together Finn rips off a piece of duct tape --

TIFFANY’S MOM
We don’t want any trouble--

He covers her mouth

FINN
Sorry sweetheart

Finn methodically moves on to the next parent

Soon all the parents’ mouths are duct taped shut and their
wrists and feet are tightly bound

Malcolm surveys the hostages overly anxious --

MALCOLM

(quietly)
Now we just wait till the snow stops
Then we bolt with Cheng

(to parents)
You hear that You behave and no
one gets hurt You don’t behave
that’s a different story

Finn isn’t even listening He kneels down and stares right
into Tiffany’s Mom’s eyes

FINN
Ooh I’m gonna party with you

Finn caresses her exposed arm Tiffany’s Dad squirms
trying to yell his voice muffled under the duct tape
Finn grins

FINN
Tell him to simmer down or I’11 put
my boot in his face Oh wait that’s
right

Tears form in Tiffany’s Mom’s eyes
FINN
A woman who can’t talk My kind of
girl

Finn touches her arm again

FINN

Bet you like it dirty
MALCOLM

Back off
FINN

Just playin’

Malcolm nods to Spencer and they both double-check the
restraints

FINN
What You don’t trust me

Racked with fear the teens can only watch as their parents
lie there bound and humiliated

Brian points backwards letting them know they should sneak
quietly into the adjoining room

JJ nods in agreement They wait for the right moment

As Finn and Spencer work Brian’s Mom spots the kids hiding
behind the cabinet Realizing Shane isn’t with them she
locks eyes with Brian

Brian nods at his mom He’1l find Shane

The teens slither backwards slowly one by one Tiffany
goes first then Allie

Just as JJ and Brian begin to move backwards Malcolm paces
in their direction

He’s about to stumble right onto them Brian’s Mom jolts
forward with a muffled SCREAM knocking a lamp off a nearby
table CRASH

Malcolm turns around as Finn BACKHANDS Brian’s Mom drawing
blood from her lip

Brian’s Dad reacts furious He throws his body at Finn

Finn jumps crow bar about to rain down but Malcolm GRABS
his arm and stops him from beating Brian’s Dad to death

MALCOLM
Back off

Finn yanks his arm from Malcolm and stares daggers at him

FINN
Don’t ever touch me

The tension is palpable as Malcolm backs off

MALCOLM
We’re on the same team Okay

FINN
Sure Yeah

MALCOLM
(to Brian’s Mom)
Do that again and I won’t be able to
stop him

Brian’s Mom cowers She looks over relieved that her son
is safe for now

INT LOWER HALLWAY - SAME

Tiffany Allie JJ and Brian regroup still careful to
remain quiet Brian points towards a back room

They all move towards the back when Allie turns to see
something that startles her This makes Brian turn

Down the hall he can see his brother SHANE walking
directly towards the living room

His head’s down engulfed in a game on his portable
Nintendo headplugs in

BRIAN
Nonononono

JI
I got him

JJ darts ahead turning the corner and doubling back
around

Brian and Allie try to get Shane’s attention because they
can’t walk towards him without being seen

BRIAN
Come on look up --

We can hear the commotion in the living room but Shane is
oblivious as he keeps walking forward

INT OPPOSITE HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

Shane is about to turn into the living room just a few
feet away from imminent danger --

When JJ appears from the opposite side and GRABS him

Shane rips off his headphones as JJ wraps a hand over his
mouth and YANKS him backwards out of harm’s way

JT
Keep your mouth shut

Shane wants to say something but the horrific look in JJs
eyes scares the hell out of him

As they both slowly move backwards we see Shane’s Nintendo
on the ground

He dropped it

INT BACK DEN - MOMENTS LATER

Brian Allie and Tiffany are frantic until JJ and Shane
rush in Brian gives his brother a big hug --

BRIAN
Stupid dick

SHANE
Love you too

TIFFANY
So what now

SHANE
This is really happening isn’t it

Brian nods and Shane nods too trying to process the
situation

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

The parents huddle beside each other as Finn goes through
nearby purses He takes a swig of his vodka Malcolm and
Spencer pace back and forth obviously on edge

After a moment Malcolm spots something on the floor near
the couch He walks over and quickly realizes what it is

Shane’s VIDEO GAME

But he doesn’t say anything When Finn turns around
Malcolm KICKS the game under the couch and out of view

MALCOLM
I’1l do a perimeter check--
(to Spencer)
Why don’t you check the doors Make
sure they’re all locked

FINN
(grinning)
You two gonna leave me here all
alone

Malcolm looks at the parents hesitating
FINN
(wicked smile)

You can trust me boss

Malcolm and Spencer walk out as Finn eyes the huddled
parents like fresh meat

INT HALLWAY - SAME

The moment they exit and are out of earshot of Finn
Malcolm pushes Spencer to a corner --

MALCOLM
How well do you know this guy

Spencer shrugs

MALCOLM
You said you did time with him
Didn’t say he was out of his mind

SPENCER

You needed a driver He was
available

Spencer gestures aggressively to the snow covered window

SPENCER
This wasn’t part of the deal

MALCOLM
You tell him about the kids
SPENCER
He knows about Cheng That’s it

MALCOLM
Christ

Spencer steps closer to Malcolm Sweat drips down

Malcolm’s neck his hands shake Spencer’s almost a foot

taller than him He leans over Malcolm gun raised

SPENCER
How many of these runs have you
actually done Boss

Malcolm stares Spencer down a creepy Santa Mask face-

but Malcolm’s hands tremble which is answer enough

MALCOLM
Go find the kids-- lock em up
somewhere secure I’1l stay with the
others-- make sure he doesn’t do
anything stupid

Spencer hovers over Malcolm for a second longer then
lumbers off As soon as he’s gone Malcolm relaxes

INT BACK DEN - SAME

The teens are gathered by the wall glancing out into
hallway as they try to formulate a plan

BRIAN
We have to get help--

TIFFANY
Can’t we just go to a neighbors or
something

JT
The closest house is over five miles
away--

ALLIE
They said they were gonna leave when
the snow stops--

JIT
Yeah with my mom

Brian has his CELLPHONE out -- no signal --

off

the

JT
I told you man-- no cell service

BRIAN
What about a landline

JJ shakes his head
JT
Rex wanted this place to be a real

retreat from civilization

But then he brightens

JIT
We have an emergency radio in the
kitchen

TIFFANY

We can use that to call the cops

JI
There’s a direct channel to the
Ranger station

ALLIE
How do we get down there

BRIAN
We don’t I’11 go--
SHANE
We should stay together--
Jd
Shane’s right Besides I know the

house
JJ sneaks out of the den and the others follow

BRIAN
Which way are we going

ALLIE
If the five of us try to sneak
through the halls--

JJ stops at a large PAINTING He shifts it to reveal
another narrow passageway that leads INSIDE the walls

eres
We’re not going through the halls

They all climb into the corridor between the walls --

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Finn samples the alcohol by the refreshments humming
Jingle Bells though it sounds hostile and off kilter He
opens an unopened bottle of Scotch ripping the cap off and
taking a big swig Malcolm watches him from the other side
of the room

FINN
Good shit

Malcolm glances out the window The snow’s still falling

FINN
Relax Have a drink

Malcolm shakes his head Finn scoffs then moves towards
Sarah and yanks the mask off her face Her eyes red from
the tears mouth duct taped shut

FINN
So you shit out diamonds

MALCOLM
Stop messin’ around--

FINN
(back to Sarah)
Sleep on a pile of cash at night rub
that shit all over your body I know
that’s how all you rich fucks live

Rex leans into Sarah trying to shield her

FINN
Who the hell are you

MALCOLM
What’re you doing

FINN
Just wanna get to know our friends a
little better

MALCOLM
Enough

FINN
Chill the hell out Malcolm--

MALCOLM
No names you idiot

Finn snaps up and glares at Malcolm --

FINN
What’d you say

A tense moment as Brian’s Dad keeps an eye on the
situation waiting for an opportunity He positions his
legs under him

MALCOLM
You said my name--

FINN
I ain’t no idiot--
Suddenly Brian’s Dad jolts up lunging at Finn In
response Finn BASHES Brian’s Dad with the crow bar He
resumes humming Jingle Bells as he SMASHES Brian’s Dad in
the legs and arms and back --

The parents writhe attempting to cry out their voices
muffled from the tape

FINN
You stupid boy

MALCOLM
Get off him

Finally Malcolm pulls him back

Finn almost smiles as Brian’s Mom slides over to her
husband who’s badly bruised and shaken

Finn takes another swig of Scotch

FINN
Just playin’

INT CORRIDOR BETWEEN WALLS - NIGHT

JJ leads Tiffany Brian Allie and Shane through the
confined hidden corridor behind the walls They move
slowly careful not to trip or cut themselves on exposed
nails and jagged corners

JJ can hear something through the walls Someone is on the
other side --

INTERCUT

INT HALLWAY - SAME

It’s Spencer Gun in hand he’s checking every room as he
walks down the hallway

JJ and the others hold their breath Allie sees Spencer’s
smiling Santa mask through a small crack in the wall It
almost looks like he’s staring right at her

Allie looks at Brian She wants to make a run for it but
he shakes his head

Spencer halts as if he heard something and JJ and Brian
exchange a glance

But then Spencer keeps walking stopping at another one of
those PAINTINGS on the opposite wall It’s a bit crooked
He reaches out and slides it over to reveal

Nothing No passageway behind this one

Finally Spencer turns and keeps walking

When the coast is clear the FALSE WALL across from where
Spencer just was slides open and JJ steps out The others

soon follow

JIT
Kitchen’s this way

They all sneak down the hall heading for the radio

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

They enter and JJ immediately moves for the cabinet and
pulls out a dusty EMERGENCY RADIO from a cardboard box

JJ fumbles plugging it in

BRIAN
Please tell me you know how to use
this thing

JT
(sheepish)
Weve never had an emergency before

Brian takes the radio from him He plugs it in turning
the knob but all we hear is static

SHANE
Fix it

eres
We just have to get a signal

JJ and Brian change the channels on the radio trying to
find a clear station

Frantic they all crowd around --

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Finn keeps drinking Malcolm is tense Brian’s Dad nurses
his wounds as the other parents cower in fear

FINN
How much you gettin’ for her

MALCOLM
You already agreed on your share

FINN
A hundred grand to drive For some
reason that don’t seem fair

MALCOLM
Stick to the plan

Malcolm glances down and spots Shane’s VIDEO GAME which
after the recent scuffle is now in plain sight

FINN
My brother used to do all our
planning He’d like you And by
that I mean he’d probably slit your
throat

Malcolm acknowledges what Finn’s saying but moves forward
and tries to slide the video game console back under the
couch without him noticing --

FINN
Whatcha got there

MALCOLM
Nothing

Finn walks over and grabs the VIDEO GAME His eyes flicker
back and forth becoming increasingly manic

FINN
A kid’s game

ALLIE’S DAD
That’s mine

Malcolm and Finn both ignore Allie’s Dad From the kitchen
comes a low BANGING

MALCOLM
Just relax--

Finn reaches around his back and retrieves A GUN as he
moves for the hallway

MALCOLM
Don’t--

The Parents attempt to SCREAM trying to warn the kids as
Finn rushes into the hallway Malcolm follows

INT KITCHEN - SAME

After another moment of turning the knob a station comes
in clear though there’s some static --

SHANE
Got it--

They all fight for control but Brian grabs the radio’s
receiver

BRIAN
(then)
Hello Hello There’s been a break-
in-- we need help--

They all listen quickly losing hope as the channel dips in
and out of static Then

RADIO
(static-filled)
This is Ranger station verify

location
Success They all jump up hugging each other relieved
BRIAN

We’re at the old Rosewood lodge JJ
what’s the address JJ

Brian freezes when he sees JJ and Tiffany wide-eyed
staring behind him Turning fast Brian sees Spencer
standing by the doorway gun drawn

Spencer walks over and THROWS the static ridden radio on
the floor STOMPING on it until it’s in pieces The other
kids move to the far corner with Brian

Brian hones in on the exit door but Spencer keeps a close
eye -- glancing at the door and then back to Brian as if
challenging him

Suddenly through the door Finn appears When he sees the
kids rage builds in his eyes --

FINN
You gotta be kidding me

When Spencer turns Brian uses the opportunity and pushes
Spencer towards Finn

BRIAN
Run

Completely panicked the kids race out of the kitchen but
not before Finn reacts and PULLS the trigger --

SHOOTING JJ IN THE SHOULDER

The force of the bullet SLAMS him against the wall --

TIFFANY

Brian grabs JJ leading him away

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

The parents struggle against their bindings reacting to
hearing that gunshot

INT HALLWAYFOYER - SAME

The kids sprint down the hallway Brian helping JJ along
as Finn chases them --

Shane grabs a VASE from a nearby table and throws it at
Finn’s head It BREAKS slicing Finn’s head and slowing
him down --

The kids all dart to the stairs taking two and three steps
at a time when Malcolm appears from another hallway

MALCOLM
Put the gun away--

Still enraged Finn shoves the gun right in Malcolm’s face
Finn’s hand trembles finger scratching the trigger --

FINN
Move

Malcolm backs off --

FINN
Ill take care of this

Finn bounds up the stairs --

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
Allie helps Brian with JJ as they all run down the hallway
Finn appears at the end of the hall --

ALLIE
Over there

Allie leads them to the old MINI-ELEVATOR --

ALLIE
Get in

They pile into the cramped space barely able to fit --

Brian’s the last one to get inside as they see Finn round
the corner and their eyes lock

Brian slams the grated door shut Finn feet away --

INT MINI-ELEVATOR - SAME

SHANE
What now

Finn BANGS on the door with so much force it rocks the
whole elevator

Finn watches the mini-elevator drop and then turns and runs
back the way he came

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

The elevator SLAMS to a stop on the first floor as they all
stagger into the hallway

This way

They sprint around the corner and past a small room --

BRIAN
Over here

INT TRIANGLE ROOM - SAME

Brian runs into the room and immediately pulls back the
painting that covers the secret door they found earlier

INT NARROW CORRIDOR - SAME

They all make it inside as Brian slides the painting back
in place sweating from the exertion Allie makes them
stop even though it’s a tight squeeze

As everyone catches their breath she motions for
silence

INT SMALL ROOM - SAME

Through the doorway we see Spencer run down the hall past
the triangle room

Then Finn shows up He looks into the triangle room then
steps inside staring long and hard at his surroundings

His gaze falls on the painting covering the secret door
though with that smiling Santa Mask it’s hard to tell what
he’s really focusing on

After a tense moment Finn moves back into the hallway

INT NARROW CORRIDOR - SAME

The kids stay still until they hear Finn leave the
floorboards of the house CREAKING under his feet

ALLIE

BRIAN
Keep moving--

Brian leads them all down the narrow hall Tiffany almost
hits her head on a rusted beam

TIFFANY
Where are we

Allie shushes Tiffany and points up ahead as they walk
through the room we saw earlier

Above them is the floor to the living room They can hear
their parents whispering as Malcolm mumbles to himself

There’s a wooden door that leads through another
passageway Brian helps JJ as they enter

INT MINING BASEMENT - SAME

A large room cluttered with old rusty mining equipment

Ain’t no way you get paid Ain’t no
way

Finn sits back down with his Scotch He eyes Tiffany’s Mom
and then winks Tiffany’s Dad sidles up to her

FINN
Someone needs to go find them damn
kids

Malcolm turns to Spencer

MALCOLM
Go

Spencer leaves begrudgingly

FINN
You two-- runnin’ around with your
heads cut off-- shit

Rex wobbling attempts to get up Sarah shakes her head
trying to stop him --

FINN
Sit down gold digga

Rex struggles to speak through the duct tape His eyes are
earnest pleading

Malcolm nods to Finn who RIPS off the duct tape Rex
gasps

REX
Money-- that’s what you want right
I’ve got it In my room

That gets Finn and Malcolm’s attention

FINN
How much

REX
It was a deposit for my contractor--

FINN
How much

REX
A hundred and fifty thousand

FINN
That’s it That won’t pay for shit

REX
You can just take it and go we won’t
say a word No cops no trouble
Just money

Finn and Malcolm exchange glances

MALCOLM
Show me

Malcolm drags Rex up and heads for the door Rex struggling
to keep up with his bound hands and feet

MALCOLM
Ill be back with the cash and then
were leaving

FINN
Sure boss

INT MINING BASEMENT - NIGHT

JJ is on the table Blood from his shoulder wound soaks
the “bandage” Allie tries to comfort a terrified Shane

ALLIE
How is he

JIT
I’m not dead yet
TIFFANY
He’s gonna be fine if we can close up

his arm
(off Allie’s look)
What

ALLIE
You’re pretty smart when you wanna
be

TIFFANY

Tell that to my mom

Shane spots something in a pile of junk in the corner
It’s a FLINT LOCK PISTOL

SHANE
Whoa--

ALLIE
Put that down

SHANE
Is it loaded

Allie examines the gun --

ALLIE
I don’t know Maybe

Allie thinks about it for a moment then sets the gun back
down Too afraid to even think about using it

SHANE
Shouldn’t Brian be back

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAYS - SAME

Brian slowly makes his way down the hall towards

INT REX’S BEDROOM - SAME

A massive room with exposed wood beams and tons of art
hanging from the walls By the windows there’s a wall full
of cabinets which Brian looks at with dismay

He begins opening cabinet after cabinet rummaging through
the junk in each one before he finally finds the FIRST-AID
KIT

Then he hears Malcolm and Rex approaching the floorboards
groaning under their feet

Thinking quick Brian moves for the PAINTINGS hoping to
find another secret passage but there isn’t one
Malcol

lm and Rex are getting closer

Brian more flustered now keeps searching behind

everything in the room

No hiding spot

Final

ly just as the door starts to open Brian dives

underneath the massive four-poster BED

Malcol

lm and Rex enter Malcolm pushes Rex right onto

bed as he slams the door

A long tense moment and then

REX
That psycho in there wasn’t part of
the plan Tying us up like animals

Rex stands up wobbly

MALCOLM
I had a driver but he got nailed a
few days back We needed someone--

REX
He’s gonna kill somebody

MALCOLM
We’re okay--

REX
Okay We’re screwed Please tell
me he doesn’t know I set this up

MALCOLM
He thinks it was all my idea

BRIAN shimmies farther back under the bed careful to
remain silent He can see Rex’s feet

REX
We need a new plan Fast

MALCOLM
Working on it

REX
Work harder I swear I should have
gone with that guy down in
Dorchester This would all be over
by now We’d all be rich and Id
have ten witnesses saying I was
trying to be a hero--

The clock the mirror the desk

the

MALCOLM
You’re the one who came to me--

REX
And you said you could handle it you
fucking idiot--

MALCOLM
I’m the idiot I didn’t decide to
have my own wife kidnapped to pay off
my debts

REX
No one was supposed to get hurt Not
Sarah JJ-- Oh God

Malcolm backs down Rex seems genuinely overwhelmed

REX
He’s down there right now with my
friends my family
(then)
We have to fix this

Malcolm pulls off his mask revealing his face for the
first time He looks nothing like we thought -- more
janitor than criminal

MALCOLM
Any ideas

REX
We knock him out-- tie him up

Malcolm takes a seat on the bed His gun at his side
dangling just inches from Brian’s face

BRIAN reaches his hand out for it If he snatches it
quickly he’1ll be armed and have the upper hand

MALCOLM
You distract him Make a run for it
I’1l catch him from behind It’ll
look like a grudge between us two

REX
Good-- good-- we can do this--

Just as BRIAN’S about to grab the gun Malcolm moves
slightly and Brian misses

But Malcolm feels his touch and jumps up gun raised
MALCOLM
Who’s down there
(off Rex’s look)
There’s someone under the bed
(no reply)
Fine

Malcolm aims for the middle of the bed but then Brian’s

hand reaches out

BRIAN
Please Don’t shoot

Malcolm drags Brian out from under the bed and Rex’s eyes

widen

REX
Brian-- it’s not what you think--

BRIAN
JJs hurt These guys shot him He
could be dying right now--

REX
What

BRIAN
They shot JJ

REX
Nononono that’s not what they said
would happen--

BRIAN
We need to help JJ

Rex is at the end of his rope --

MALCOLM
What do we do with him

BRIAN
You gonna shoot me too

REX
No-- of course not How bad is he

BRIAN
Bad I’m not a doctor but he’s lost
a lot of blood

Despair crosses Rex’s face but before he can respond

someone KNOCKS on the door

FINN (0S)
You in there

MALCOLM
Finn-- shit--

Rex pushes Brian back under the bed just as the door swings
open and Finn enters He immediately sees Malcolm without
his mask on --

FINN
The hell’s this

MALCOLM
Calm down--

FINN
Your mask

MALCOLM
Relax--

FINN
Where’s the money

MALCOLM
There is no money--

Finn has his gun in the air riled up like a snake --

FINN
You trying to cross me You know who
I am

REX

He’s telling the truth--

In a flash Finn SMASHES Rex to the ground with the butt of
his gun

FINN
Shut up

MALCOLM
This whole thing was his idea

This stops Finn He looks from Malcolm to Rex --

FINN
What

MALCOLM
He hired me We were supposed to
grab his wife and then mess him up a
bit Make him look like a hero
Like he fought for her After the
heat died down we were supposed to
meet up with him and split the
ransom

FINN
(to Rex)
This is a scam

REX
It can still work with my help

FINN
Why the hell would I need your help
(then)
How much were you gonna get
(no reply)

How much

REX
Ten million

FINN
Damn Now that’s a payday

MALCOLM
It’s enough money for all of us We
just need to work together--

Sensing an opportunity Rex LUNGES at Finn Malcolm goes
for the gun and the fight begins --

It’s Rex and Malcolm on Finn but Finn fights dirty He
claws and bites -- elbowing REX in the head and knocking
him back to the ground

Malcolm wrestles Finn when the gun goes off firing right

got

through the bed Bullet this close to hitting Brian who’s
trembling underneath it

Rex gets back on his feet and wobbles over biting Finn
The three of them fight for the gun with everything they’ve

During the brawl Finn’s SANTA MASK is ripped in half and
we see his lean hollow-cheeked face for the first time
Those crooked teeth and crazed eyes coupled with that

cheery St Nick grin

Malcolm and Finn both have the gun struggling for control

Then suddenly
The gun goes off again

And Malcolm falls to the floor

Finn gun in hand pushes Rex to the ground and looks down
at Malcolm who’s gurgling blood and convulsing For the

first time Finn seems a bit overwhelmed like he’s never

actually killed someone

FINN
Shit

REX
You killed him--

FINN
Yeah well-- I didn’t have a choice
did I
Finn paces back and forth staring back at Rex
FINN
Shit shit shit This is all your

fault Fuckin’ genius

REX
It’s over-- just let us go--

Finn PULLS Rex up by his hair and YANKS him out the door
like a sack of rocks

When the coast is clear Brian emerges from under the bed

He leans down as Malcolm tries to say something but only
blood comes from his mouth

Brian leans closer and he can hear Malcolm’s last word

MALCOLM
hide

This sends a shiver down Brian’s spine as he stumbles back
towards the door and exits with the first-aid kit

INT MINING BASEMENT - NIGHT

Brian has a hand over JJs mouth muffling his screams
while Tiffany pours hydrogen peroxide on the wound Allie
squeezes one hand and Shane squeezes the other

JT
Jesuuuuus--

TIFFANY
I’ve never done this before--

BRIAN
Keep going--

ALLIE
Youre doing great--

JJ SCREAMS again as Tiffany pours more --

TIFFANY
Just a little more

All we can see is blood seeping out of the shoulder wound

INT HALLWAYS - SAME

Spencer walks up and down the hallways He passes the
small triangle room with the secret door

He stops Like he heard something

INT MINING BASEMENT - SAME

Tiffany finishes cleaning the wound JJ’s sweating and
shaking Allie and Shane standby as Brian paces in the
background

JT
No more please

Tiffany steps back Tries to calm herself down --

TIFFANY
I have to sew it up--

ALLIE
And he’1l be okay

TIFFANY
(to JJ)
You’1l have to go to a doctor soon
and have it removed but at least
you won’t bleed to death

JI
Let’s go with that No bleeding to
death

Tiffany grabs a needle and thread

TIFFANY
(holding his hand)
You know you’re kind of cute when
you’re in pain

eres
You gonna make out with me now

Tiffany cracks another nervous smile Thankful for the
reprieve She takes a deep breath and gets back to work

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

With his mask hanging around his neck Finn enters
dragging Rex behind him

SARAH
Rex

Finn throws Rex to the ground as Sarah comforts him Finn
locks eyes with the other parents He can feel them
staring at his exposed face

Finn grabs the Scotch and takes another drink After a
moment Spencer enters from the hallway taking in the

scene —-—-

SPENCER
Where’s--

REX
He shot him He’s dead

This knocks Spencer back Completely caught off guard
FINN
(re Rex)
Did you know

Spencer looks at Rex Finn clenches his gun

FINN
Did you know about him

SPENCER
Wasn’t supposed to go down like this

Finn aims his gun at Spencer

SPENCER
All I know is we got the same bookie
One day he gave Malcolm a call said
he could make big money

The parents all turn to Rex Rex can’t meet their eyes
especially Sarahs --

SPENCER
We had it all figured-- hide-out
drop location But this guy
(nods to Rex)
He got it started

FINN
And those shit kids

SPENCER
He told us they’d be out of the way
We were just gonna grab Cheng and go

Tears stream down Sarah’s face Rex finally looks at his
wife then his friends Soaking in his guilt

He hangs his head in shame The others can’t believe it
Brian’s Dad lunges at Rex but Finn holds him down

Sarah collapses a complete mess The other parents stare
at her and then Rex the sting of betrayal in their eyes --

REX

I made some bad bets-- dropped too
much into this damn lodge

(to Sarah)
What was I supposed to do Tell your
parents I used their money to pay off
a bookie-- that I still owe him seven-
figures

Sarah curls up in a ball SOBBING not wanting to hear it

Rex just sits there drowning in regret The other
parents’ anger clouds the room

Spencer and Finn move to the side Talking quietly

SPENCER
I say we bail

Finn takes a drink considering --

FINN
How many kids still running around

SPENCER
Five

Finn sees all the parents looking at him He touches his
exposed face thinking

FINN
New plan

Spencer shakes his head Turns to door Finn cocks his
gun a warning

FINN
You want to piss me off

Spencer lurches towards him swiftly strong arming Finn
until he has Finn’s gun He’s nearly twice Finn’s size

FINN
Go ahead You sure you want to hurt
me Take that chance You know
who’ll come after you if you do
It’s happened before Pretty little
wife of yours might not be so pretty
when he’s done

After a long moment Spencer backs down Hands Finn back
his gun

FINN
Find those kids

Finn clenches his teeth Takes another drink and finishes
the bottle

INT MINING BASEMENT - NIGHT

Tiffany finishes bandaging JJs freshly sewn-up arm It
actually looks pretty good as JJ slowly stands up a bit
wobbly but okay

TIFFANY
Don’t ever get shot again

JT
Ill try not to

Brian keeps pacing
SHANE
Would you sit down already
ALLIE
Youve barely said a word since you

got back
Finally Brian turns to JJ --

BRIAN
It was Rex He hired those guys to
kidnap your mom for the ransom

JT
Bullshit--

BRIAN
I heard him say it It was right
before I saw one of them get shot

JIT
Youre lying

ALLIE
Why would he lie

TIFFANY
What about my parents-- are they
okay

BRIAN

Don’t worry My dad’1ll make sure
your mom’s just fine

TIFFANY
What’s that supposed to mean

BRIAN
All those conferences your mom was
going to-- my dad opening stores--
they were together

Tiffany’s taken back All of their lives falling
TIFFANY
Gross
BRIAN

Guess she’s not so perfect after all

JI
I’m gonna kill him--

The kids

TIFFANY
How could she do that to my dad

ALLIE
Stop I think we’re missing the
point here If we don’t do
something our parents could all be
dead by morning

exchange glances They know she’s right

TIFFANY
They’ve got guns

SHANE
So do we

Shane lifts up the Flintlock Pistol he found earlier --

BRIAN
Drop it

SHANE
We’1ll just shoot ‘em

JI
There’s no bullets in that thing

SHANE
Then what’s it for

JIT

One of the miners must have left it
back in the day It’s ancient Only
thing it shoots now is sparks

ALLIE
(then)
Snowmobile Your dad said--

eres
Shit I forgot There’s an old one
in the back shed The keys should be
hanging behind the door

TIFFANY
You can’t ride with your shoulder--

BRIAN
I can--

SHANE
Youre not going by yourself again--

ALLIE
I’1l go with you

Brian looks to Allie

BRIAN
Sure

ALLIE
It’s worth a shot

BRIAN
Okay me and Allie will go to town
and get help You guys stay here--

JIT
You think you’re just gonna walk out
and start ‘em up They’1ll hear you
from a mile away

BRIAN
Got a better idea

JJ takes a breath Checks his shoulder He pulls out his
cellphone sets the timer

JT
A distraction

TIFFANY
What kind of distraction

JT
Give us ten minutes

INT TRIANGLE ROOM - LATER

The PAINTING slides over as Brian and Allie sneak out
quietly carrying archaic mining equipment as weapons
They check the halls They can hear commotion at one end

They sneak down the other end towards the kitchen and out
the back door careful to not make too much noise

EXT ROSEWOOD LODGE - NIGHT

The blizzard has died down considerably but there’s still
a flurry of snow falling outside as Brian and Allie quietly
sneak into the back yard

They trudge through the two-feet of powder heading
straight for a small WOODEN SHED near the FROZEN POND

INT SHED - SAME

We see an old rusted SNOWMOBILE parked inside covered with
cobwebs and dust

BRIAN
Keys--

Allie looks behind the door There must be twenty sets

ALLIE
Which one

BRIAN
Try ‘em all

Allie and Brian grab keys and scramble to try them in the

snowmobile Brian checks the timer on his cellphone four
minutes remaining --

INT BANQUET ROOM - SAME

JJ Tiffany and Shane sneak into the room carrying their
own mining equipment weapons careful not to make too much
noise They can hear Finn and the parents a couple rooms
away No sign of Spencer

TIFFANY
What’re we looking for

JJ moves to the exposed brick wall and the WATER PIPES

He checks the timer on his phone and then TWISTS one of the
valves as water pours out of a nearby faucet Shane and
Tiffany get the idea and they start twisting faucets as
well

Soon there’s a flood of water pouring onto the floor

INT SHED - SAME
Brian finds a key that fits the snowmobile --

BRIAN
Got it

Allie hops on the back wrapped in blankets

BRIAN
You ready for this

ALLIE
(smiles )
No

Brian returns the smile and positions his shaking hand over
the keys

They both watch the timer on his phone tick down from one
minute --

BRIAN
Come on JJ

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

The tension in the room is palpable Rex is in the corner
by himself an outcast Finn’s drunk playing with his
gun staring lustfully at Tiffany’s Mom who’s huddled by
the rest of the parents

FINN
I’m Finn-- short for Finnegan

Finn swaggers towards her Leaning in close
FINN

How about you and me grab a little
alone time

Tiffany’s Mom tries to head butt him in a rage Her
husband writhes in protest

FINN
Alright hero What you gonna do
Gonna take a bullet for her

Tiffany’s Dad thinks about this He stops struggling

FINN
Didn’t think so

The second Finn uses his hand to caress Tiffany’s Moms
leg reaching up her inner thigh Brian’s Dad LUNGES --

Finn stares at Brian’s Dad then looks at Tiffany’s Mom
Connecting the dots

FINN
Damn How many of these boys you
bangin’

Panic flashes across Tiffany’s Mom’s face Tiffany’s Dad
and Brian’s Mom look over

Finn picks up on the confusion He laughs and points his
gun right at Tiffany’s Mom --

FINN
(to Brian’s Dad)
You love her

Brian’s Dad shakes his head He squirms trying to get
free

Finn presses the gun into her forehead She cries --

FINN
Do you love her No lying I can
tell

REX
Stop it

FINN
Answer or I put her brains on the
floor Do you love her

Brian’s Dad shakes his head flailing attempting to SHOUT
through the duct tape but it just sounds like guttural
grunts

FINN
I don’t believe you

Finn CLICKS the pistol Everyone screams The tension
amps to an unbearable level --

Then Brian’s Dad flings himself over Tiffany’s Mom trying
to shield her

He nods broken Crying He looks to his wife who sits
stunned

Finn uncocks his gun and leans back amused The parents
all stare The seams unraveling

FINN
Damn you rich kids More fun than a
bag of firecrackers

Allie’s Dad shakes his head mumbling something derogatory
towards Finn

FINN
(to Allie’s Dad)
Say something

Finn laughs in his drunkenness
FINN
Too much excitement for you Maybe
youre right Maybe I should find
another way to have fun
Finn leans right into Allie’s Dad --
FINN
I did see a couple cute girls running
around earlier Maybe when I find
them I can have some real fu--
Enraged Allie’s Dad attacks catching Finn off guard and
knocking him down where he CRACKS his head on the floor
Blood trickles down Finn’s face

But Finn is swiftly up his gun pointed at Allie’s Dad
who’s bubbling with anger --

FINN
You don’t think I’1l1 do it

Allie’s Dad stands firm
Finn has his finger on the trigger --

FINN
Don’t ever touch me

Finn pushes Allie’s Dad to the floor when he notices a
small river of WATER flooding in from the hall --

FINN
The hell

Finn follows the water to check it out --

INT BANQUET ROOM - SAME

He enters to find more water spraying out of the faucet
flooding the room Finn trudges through the water and
turns off the valve

Outside he hears a noise An ENGINE starting --

INT SHED - SAME
Brian and Allie watch the timer on Brian’s phone hit zero

Brian TURNS the ignition and it sparks for a moment then
gurgles and dies

BRIAN
Shit

ALLIE
What’s the matter

BRIAN
Frozen-—

Brian tries again The engine roars loudly then dies
again

INT FOYER - SAME
As soon as Finn enters --

JJ (0S8)
Hey stupid You slow or something

He turns to see JJ Tiffany and Shane standing at the top
of the stairs Finn immediately runs for them bounding up
two steps at a time --

FINN
Little shits

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

JJ Tiffany and Shane sprint down the labyrinth of halls
as Finn catches up behind them

JT
Come on

JJ pushes over a TABLE to block the hallway but Finn jumps
over it with ease

INT SHED - SAME

Brian and Allie continue to crank the snowmobile over and
over but it just won’t start

ALLIE
Can’t you do something

Brian has the hood popped desperate to get it working

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

Tiffany and Shane round a corner when Finn dives and KNOCKS
JJ to the ground Finn’s got him by the legs as JJ kicks
and fights --

TIFFANY
JJ

JI
Keep going

JJ finally lands a kick though he grimaces from the
exertion Finn lets go and JJ scrambles to his feet
nursing his hurt shoulder --

JI
To the right

FINN
You ain’t goin’ nowhere

Finn is back on his feet as he continues to chase them

JJ Tiffany and Shane run through a doorway into --

INT SQUARE ROOM - SAME

A half-finished room with exposed walls and FOUR CLOSET
doors Two of them are old and two new

JJ Tiffany and Shane enter the LEFT DOOR and slam it
shut

Seconds later Finn enters He opens the RIGHT DOOR and
looks inside but no one’s there

Then he moves to the left door The one they entered

That room is empty as well He notices that one wall is
broken and leads right into the next closet over

Just as he realizes it JJ Shane and Tiffany run out of
the CENTER CLOSET DOOR

Finn doubles back --

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

JJ leads Tiffany and Shane to the back STAIRWELL and they
run downstairs --

INT FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - SAME

Shane is the first one down but the second his feet touch
the first floor --

He’s ambushed by Spencer who pops up behind the bannister
and grabs him

TIFFANY
Let him go

Shane fights under Spencer’s grasp JJ and Tiffany try to
wrestle him free while fending Spencer off with their
mining equipment

But they can hear Finn coming down the stairs towards them

TIFFANY
He’s almost here

Shane ducks realizing he’s doomed

SHANE
Go Get out of here

JIT
No way in hell

SHANE
Hurry

Finn’s almost there At the last second Tiffany and JJ
back away running down the hallway and around the corner
out of sight

Finn sees them and gives chase But when he turns the
corner Tiffany and JJ are gone He kicks the wall

FINN
Shit

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

The parents huddle together They hear FOOTSTEPS OS
Finn YELLING

Brian’s Dad nods to Allie’s Dad They struggle to stand

The others attempt to loosen their plastic tie bindings
their wrists raw and bloody

INT SHED - NIGHT
Brian tries one more time to get the snowmobile started

He cranks the key and the engine roars to life but then it
starts smoking and dies This thing’s not moving

ALLIE
What now

Brian is at a loss He SLAMS his fist into the handlebars

BRIAN
We have to go back

ALLIE
They’1ll see us--

BRIAN
Either that or catch hypothermia

They hear the sound of an approaching vehicle --

Brian and Allie scramble to their feet and stare out the
frosted window

Outside they see a pair of HEADLIGHTS as a vehicle parks
on the far end of the driveway near the street

In the darkness of the night and the snow flurries it’s
impossible to tell what kind of car it is

BRIAN
(relieved)
You were right

ALLIE
Come on

Allie runs out of the shed Brian follows

EXT FRONT YARD - SAME

They fight through the still falling snow as a MAN exits
the BEAT UP TRUCK and moves towards them

BRIAN
Hey-- hello

ALLIE
We need help

Wrapped tightly in a thick jacket scarf and hat the MAN
approaches with a calm smiling face

MAN
You two okay

Suspicious Allie backs away --

ALLIE
Who are you

MAN
I live at the bottom of the hill
Wife thought she heard gunshots
Now what’s going on You two look
freezing

BRIAN
These men broke-in They have our
parents--

ALLIE
And guns--

MAN
Whoa slow down Guns What men

ALLIE
Please we need to call the police

The Man looks towards the house a bit nervous --
MAN
Let’s go to my place I have a

landline--

ALLIE
Thank you so much

The Man leads Allie and Brian to his truck

BRIAN
So where’s your house

MAN
About a mile down the road

Allie opens the passenger side door Brian slows
thinking

BRIAN
Strange
(off Man’s look)
It’s just our buddy said the
closest house was over five miles
from here

A heavy silence The Man smiles

Before Brian and Allie can even register what’s happening
the Man pulls out a flat black sawed-off SHOTGUN It’s
only about ten-inches long but it could put a ten-inch hole
in your chest

BRIAN
What’re you doing

Brian LUNGES at the Man but he gets SMASHED in the face
with the butt of the shotgun He spits blood

When the Man speaks it’s simple and straight Almost
inhuman

MAN
House Now

Brian looks at the Man then does the unexpected He
lurches up and KNOCKS the shotgun into the snow

BRIAN
(to Allie)
RUUUUN
Brian and Allie sprint back towards the shed and the FROZEN
POND as the Man casually leans down finds his shotgun and
wipes it off with his scarf

He just starts walking after them Slowly

BRIAN
Hurry

BOOOOOOOM I

He FIRES a shot Wood on the shed confettis

BRIAN
This way

They turn the other way trudging through the snow
stumbling towards the pond They’re exposed with nowhere
else to hide

After a struggle they make it to the shore line and just
keep running across the ICE

BRIAN
Keep going

On the bank the Man just stands there He lifts his
shotgun and puts Brian and Allie in his crosshairs
They’re like sitting ducks

And just as he’s about to pull the trigger

The ice CRACKS and they BOTH FALL THROUGH into the
freezing water

UNDERWATER -- Allie struggles to get back to the surface
but Brian stops her He’s a swimmer and he knows they
can’t just pop back up or they’ll get shot Panicked she
fights him

On the bank the Man stands there for what feels like
minutes his shotgun aimed waiting to pick the kids off
when they re-surface

UNDERWATER -- Allie pushes against Brian fading
The Man studies the calm waters of the pond
From the lodge comes an EAR-SPLITTING GUNSHOT BLAST --

The Man’s attention shifts With one last glance at the
pond he lowers his shotgun and heads towards the lodge

After another moment

Brian and Allie peak to the surface gasping for air
shaking from the cold

Brian helps Allie climb onto the ice dripping with water
as he helps her up and they stumble towards the shed

INT SHED - SAME

The second they get inside Allie falls to the ground
going into shock

Brian helps Allie out of her soaking wet jacket and outer
clothes and then takes off his outer clothes as well A
desperate attempt to stay warm

He grabs the tarp that covered the snowmobile and wraps it
around them both holding Allie close rubbing her arms
trying to increase their body warmth

BRIAN

(shivering)
Stay with me

INT NARROW CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Tiffany and JJ slip through the cramped passageway under
the main floor

TIFFANY
You think Brian and Allie got away

The keep moving forward until they’re in

INT ROOM UNDER LIVING ROOM - SAME

Before they pass through they hear something above They
sneak a look into

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Finn and Spencer enter They throw Shane to the ground as
his parents slide over to him Finn fires a SHOT to the
ceiling trigger happy The parents cringe

Spencer binds Shane with plastic ties slapping duct tape
over his mouth

SPENCER
Time to go

FINN
And leave all these witnesses running
around

And right on cue the front door begins to open

Finn and Spencer train their guns on the door but Finn
drops his gun and grins once he sees it’s THE MAN his
stare eerily calculating and cold

FINN
Oh it’s on

Spencer steps back

SPENCER
How’d you call your brother

This is GABE A full-blooded psychopath and everyones
worst nightmare Gabe just looks around the room studying
the parents watching him and Finn

FINN
Knew you’d show up

GABE
What took so long

FINN
Damn blizzard messed it all up-- then
Malcolm--

Spencer stiffens realizing --

SPENCER
What the hell You were gonna screw
us over all along

FINN
Just Malcolm We were gonna dump him
after getting the girl into town

SPENCER
What were you gonna do with me

GABE
Hadn’t decided

Spencer takes a moment He grips his gun but then he sees
Gabe watching challenging Spencer with that calm non-
blinking gaze Spencer relaxes his grip

GABE
Where’s Malcolm

SPENCER
He killed him

Gabe glances at Finn impressed

FINN
(fake bravado)
He had it coming

At this Gabe smiles slightly It’s enough encouragement
for Finn to get the pep back in his step

FINN
Oh and get this-- this whole thing
was a joke Turns out the husband
over there was the one who hired
Malcolm in the first place

GABE
Doesn’t matter

Gabe turns to Sarah He walks over and straightens her
top Taking his time She shudders repulsed and afraid
His hands lower to smooth out the wrinkles on her skirt

FINN
I know I messed up and took too long
but tell me you got some kinda plan
Somethin’ genius

Gabe just stares at the parents Brian’s Mom meets his
gaze eyes wide tears streaming down her face Gabe pulls
out a switchblade

GABE
Brother do you want to play a game

Finn claps his hands getting pumped

FINN
Aw yeah

GABE
(nods to Spencer)
Take off your mask

SPENCER
Hell no

Gabe leans down to Brian’s Mom thrusting the blade towards
her eye She tries to scream squirming but Gabe holds
her down The other parents struggle around her

GABE
Life dear brother is about choices
Will our friend go with choice A and
take off his mask Or choice B--

He brings the blade inches away from Brian’s Mom’s eye

GABE
(laughing good-naturedly)
Well shit What do you call knifing
someone in the eye and yanking out
their optic nerve

Finn can hardly contain himself

FINN
Youre all screwed You’re gonna get
it You’re gonna--

Gabe pushes the blade millimeters above Brian’s Mom’s eye
She’s hysterical floundering --

SPENCER
Jesus

Spencer throws off his mask and Gabe drops Brian’s Mom
who sobs on the floor

Spencer looks down Without his mask he almost seems
gentle his face soft and pudgy

GABE
All about persuasion brother
Compromise

Finn whistles soaking in every word

Gabe stands He sees the cut on Finn’s head and examines
it

FINN
(re Allie’s Dad)
Hero tried to kill me when I started
talkin’ about his daughter

GABE
(to Allie’s Dad)
The one I met outside With the
blonde boy--

Brian’s Mom and Allie’s Dad exchange a look

Gabe turns to Allie’s Dad who’s trembling now fearing the
worst He tries to speak but of course can’t through the
tape The other parents look on with dread

SPENCER
(resigned)
What did you do

Finn’s getting riled up again feeding off the fear Gabe
puts away his switchblade and takes out a cloth from his
jacket He picks up his shotgun cleaning it Brian’s Dad
still struggles to speak

FINN
Yeah brother Tell us

Gabe puts away the cloth He squats down next to Allie’s
Dad and then smiles

GABE
I watched ‘em drown

Rage fills Allie’s Dad He lunges forward but this time
there’s no hesitation --

GABE JUST FIRES HIS SHOTGUN INTO ALLIE’S DADS CHEST

He’s blown backwards -- BLOOD and GUTS splatter falling on
the other shocked parents

UNDER THE FLOOR -- JJ clamps a hand over Tiffany’s mouth
preventing her from yelling out

Even as blood drips through the cracks in the floor
trickling down on JJ and Tiffany

The parents murmur and sob completely horrified Spencer
and Finn are even stunned Gabe calmly wipes away bloody
chunks of Allie’s Dad off his jacket

GABE
Gas cans in my truck

SPENCER
What’re you gonna do

But Gabe just fixes his gaze on Spencer Spooked Spencer
nods and heads for the truck

INT ROOM UNDER LIVING ROOM - SAME
JJ pulls Tiffany back into the corridor
TIFFANY
He killed them-- Allie Brian
Allie’s Dad-- they’re dead--

JJ eyes a small dirty window at the end of the corridor
leading to the front yard

JT
Come with me--
TIFFANY
Where
JT

Can’t let them do this

Tiffany nods wiping away her fear as JJ leads her to the
window

EXT FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

The coast is clear as JJ and Tiffany run through the
freezing cold towards Gabe’s truck

From the front door Spencer plods through the snow to the
truck head down in the wind

JT
Hurry-—-

Tiffany lifts a tarp in the bed where she finds TWO LARGE
CANS OF GASOLINE --

They grab them and run ducking around the truck just as
Spencer walks up

INT SHED - NIGHT
Brian and Allie huddle in the corner shivering

ALLIE
Worst Christmas ever

Brian has no answer

BRIAN
I got accepted to RISD this morning
for graphic design

ALLIE
Your first choice

BRIAN
I hid the letter under my mattress so
my dad wouldn’t see I was too
afraid what he’d say Just like when
I got back from Cancun

BRIAN (CONTD)
My dad’s an asshole Allie He
didn’t want me to be with you He
wanted me to “sow my oats” That’s
why I never called You were right
I am an asshole Just like him

Allie tries to focus through the cold

ALLIE
(with warmth)
For the record even if you are one
youd make a great designer

Brian smiles slightly and that’s when they hear a noise
outside They lean up and look out the frosted window --

BRIAN
JJS-—-

He opens the door and calls out to JJ and Tiffany who run
over carrying those gas cans Tiffany hugs them both

JT
Youre alive

BRIAN
Barely Snowmobile wouldn’t start--

ALLIE
What happened inside Is everyone
okay

TIFFANY
You didn’t hear the

Tiffany and JJ exchange a look Before they can say
anything there’s another NOISE outside

JI
Get down--

They all crouch down and peek out the window as Spencer
checks the front seat and the bed of the truck but there’s
nothing

ALLIE
There’s something you’re not telling
us

JI

They wanted to use the gas to burn
the lodge down-- get rid of all the
witnesses-—
ALLIE
Oh my God We have to get our
parents out of there
Another look between JJ and Tiffany
JT
The guy the one that just got
here He shot your dad

Allie can barely register what they just said

ALLIE
What

TIFFANY
He was defending you I’m so sorry
He thought you were dead

Allie wants to scream or sob but she can’t The tears
just fall down her face as she lets it soak in

Allie takes a deep breath Motivated by anger Then

ALLIE
We gotta stop them

They look to her sensing her determination

BRIAN
Okay--

JIT
I’m with you

TIFFANY
Me too

JIT

(looks to Brian)
So what’s the plan

Allie glances down at the gas Without hesitation she
grabs the cans and heads towards the house

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Gabe and Finn surround the parents when Spencer walks in
looking confused

GABE
Well

SPENCER
Nothin’

GABE
Under the tarps

SPENCER
First place I looked

Gabe clenches his teeth annoyed

From a nearby hallway they hear a NOISE Sounds like
someone shutting a door

GABE
(to Spencer)
Go

Spencer pulls out his gun and exits Gabe turns to Finn

GABE
Get ready

INT HALLWAY - SAME

JJ stands in the corridor waiting He opens and shuts
another door creating that same noise

Just before Spencer rounds the corner JJ slips into a
three foot high secret doorway and disappears between the
walls

Spencer checks the area when he hears a similar NOISE
coming from the foyer

Spencer turns and follows the sound into

INT FOYER - SAME

Spencer stalks into the entrance room when he hears a sound
at the top of the stairs He looks up catching a glimpse
of Tiffany as she runs past --

Spencer bounds up the stairs after her --

INT ROOM UNDER LIVING ROOM - SAME

Allie sneaks quietly through the corridor carrying one can
of gas She soaks a pile of old cloth and papers then
lights them on fire

The blaze rages spewing thick SMOKE up into

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Gabe and Finn are caught off guard as the cloud of smoke
engulfs the room They cough and stagger back their
visibility slipping away

FINN
What are they doing

GABE
(re Sarah)
Grab her
Through the smoke Finn grabs Sarah

FINN
What about--

But Gabe’s already out the door Finn quickly follows

Shane Rex and the other parents are choking on smoke as
they cough and slither on the floor desperate for breath

After a moment the GRANDFATHER CLOCK on the far side of
the wall begins to wobble and move It slides over as
Brian holding a jagged mining knife enters from behind
the wall where JJ was earlier

He carries in WET SHEETS that he wraps around the parents
Brian’s Dad is hurt but beyond happy to see his son

SHANE
Brian

BRIAN
We need to get you guys outta here

Brian helps the parents to their feet using the knife to
cut through their plastic ties Once free the parents
pull off the duct tape covering their mouths

REX
Where’s JJ

Brian doesn’t even answer Rex as they all stumble into the
hidden corridor and heave the clock back in to place

INT HALLWAY - SAME

Finn grips Sarah’s arm jittery Gabe scans the area calm
and calculated

GABE
They wanna play

FINN
Let’s just go--

Gabe looks at his brother and he stops cold

Up ahead there’s another NOISE

Finn musters up his strength then walks forward with Sarah
in tow She struggles but Finn SLAMS her against the wall
until she stops fighting

Gabe looks back towards the living room and the growing
blanket of smoke

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Gabe immediately sees that the parents are gone when he
enters

He looks towards the back doorway and towards the kitchen

but just before he moves in that direction he hears
something from behind the walls

INT CORRIDOR BETWEEN WALLS - SAME

The parents are crammed in the tight space Brian’s Dad
winces coughing slightly

Brian tries to keep him quiet when --

BAAANG A spray of shotgun shells RIP right past Brian’s
neck piercing a hole in the wall as smoke and light spill
into the dark space

INTERCUT

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME
Gabe stands in the center of the room shotgun in hand
GABE
(yelling out)
IN THE WALLS

Gabe shoots again -- bullet nearly hitting Tiffany’s Mom as
Brian hustles them down the tight corridor

Gabe can hear them scurrying behind the wall like rats as
he fires a few more shots Then silence

INT CORRIDOR BETWEEN WALLS - SAME

Brian shushes everyone He pulls out his CELLPHONE and
presses some buttons then tosses it down the hall --

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Gabe hears the sound of the phone hit the ground and he
unleashes another barrage of bullets

Something is still moving behind the wall so he moves
closer still FIRING --

Shredding the wall like swiss cheese

After a moment Gabe walks over to the tattered wall and
rips the wood aside but there’s no one there

No blood No bodies
But there’s still a sound

Gabe looks down and finds a vibrating CELLPHONE -- the
alarm continually going off mocking him

INT KITCHEN - SAME

The shelving unit opens up as Brian escorts Shane and the
parents out the back door and into the yard Brian turns
to head back into the house His dad stops him --

BRIAN’S DAD
I’m not leaving you

BRIAN
Just go

BRIAN’S DAD
Listen--

BRIAN
No-- you listen Make sure Mom and
Shane are safe Get the others outta
here Now

Brian’s Dad is about to protest letting Brian go but he

can see the determination in his son’s eyes Turning
Brian’s Dad exits with the others

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Gabe reloads his shotgun and moves for the kitchen but the
second he enters --

Brian ambushes him STABBING Gabe in the side with the
mining knife Both of them take a moment surprised The
blade sticks below Gabe’s ribs Gabe drops his shotgun
grimacing It almost looks like he’1l fall down --

But then he grabs Brian by the neck even more angry Gabe
SLAMS Brian into the cabinets shattering wood and glass

Brian is strong but Gabe tosses the teenager back into the
living room like a rag doll --

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME

Spencer moves slowly down the hall gun in hand He hears
something behind a door

Spencer puts his finger on the trigger takes a breath and
swings the door open to reveal a ROOM ON FIRE

Flames lick up the walls and flicker the ceiling

Spencer backs up when he sees Tiffany running He chases
Tiffany as they sprint down the maze of hallways She
darts into the attic doorway as Spencer continues to chase
her

But the second he pounces up the steps his FOOT BREAKS
through the cracked wood and he falls through the plaster
floor where JJ nearly fell earlier
SPENCER
(in excruciating pain)
Ahhhh

He’s able to pull himself from the hole and get back on his
foot but he stumbles His ankle swollen like a balloon

INT BANQUET ROOM - SAME

Dragging Sarah with him Finn makes his way into the
cavernous room which is now swamped with smoke

FINN
Where are you kid Come on out

JJ (0S)
Let her go

Finn’s startled He can’t see JJ but he can hear him

FINN
Where are you

JJs voice seems to ECHO off the walls of the large room --

JJ (0S8)
You messed with the wrong family

FINN
Is that so

Finn turns but still no one

JJ (0S8)
I said let her go

Finn just starts SHOOTING He unloads his clip into the
walls of the room -- bullets RIPPING into wood and plaster

EXT BACK YARD - SAME

Shane Rex and the other parents make it into the snow
covered yard exhausted after their ordeal --

BRIAN’S MOM
The kids are still inside--

They look at the lodge which is filled with flames --

TIFFANY’S MOM
Tiffany Allie Brian

Suddenly Rex turns and runs back into the lodge right

through the fire The other parents try to follow but a
chunk of the porch ceiling falls blocking their way

INT KITCHEN - SAME
Rex fights through the flames He finds a KNIFE in a

drawer and runs down the back hallway towards the banquet
room --

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Brian spitting up blood struggles to get to his feet He
swings at Gabe but misses wildly

GABE
Had enough

Brian lifts his hands surrendering but Gabe ELBOWS him
across the jaw and sends him flying into the wall

GABE
Not me

Gabe storms towards Brian when he’s SMASHED across the back
of the head with a CHRISTMAS RUM BOTTLE Liquor SPILLS all
over him as he staggers for just a moment

Standing there trembling but strong is Allie

She SWINGS with the broken bottle again but this time Gabe
dodges and grabs her wrist

He BACKHANDS her across the jaw

Allie goes flying to the ground blood oozing from her lip

She looks over to see Brian lying there and next to him
her father’s motionless body

With a rage filled cry Allie gets up and tries to fight
again but Gabe KICKS her and she falls back down

INT ATTIC - SAME

Tiffany finishes laying a blanket over the gaping hole in
the floor Spencer appears in the doorway

SPENCER
You broke my ankle

She gives him a sexy little nod

TIFFANY
Thought you were tough

Spencer smiles then moves forward limping precariously
over the rotted wood

SPENCER
Dumb slut Messed everything up

TIFFANY
So come and punish me

Tiffany moves to the side steering Spencer towards the
hole But he keeps missing it She rushes around the
room attempting to dodge him --

And just as Spencer’s about to reach her he takes a step
forward PLUMMETING through the cloth --

INT BANQUET ROOM - SAME

Finn is there with Sarah when he looks up to see Spencer
falling thirty-feet to the banquet room floor

His neck SNAPS with a sickening crunch
INTERCUT
Suddenly the wood floor gives way and Tiffany falls

She reaches out grabbing a beam and catching herself her
legs dangling as she hangs there exposed

Finn senses an opportunity He points his gun at Tiffany
about to shoot when --

JJ (0S)
Hey douchebag

JJ pops out from behind the fireplace mantle Finn narrows
his eyes pissed

TIFFANY
JJ

Finn turns his gun to JJ when Sarah HEADBUTTS him breaking
his nose and makes her escape

FINN
Bitch--

JJ dives back behind the mantle but Finn chooses to go
after Sarah instead of him

JIT
(to Tiffany)
Hold on

Tiffany struggles but finally is able to pull herself up
and into the attic She yells back down --

TIFFANY
Find your mom

JJ nods and runs after Finn and Sarah --

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

Tied and gagged Sarah stammers down the smoke-filled
hallway bumping into tables and chairs desperate to get
away from Finn who’s gaining from behind

FINN
Get back here

Sarah keeps going until she hears a voice in the distance -

JT
Mom

JJ runs to his mom helping her along

JT
Come on

JJ leads his mom farther into the labyrinth when they turn
another corner and slam right into Rex

They both jump back scared Rex hurries to cut Sarahs
ties She pulls off the duct tape on her mouth A heavy
silence between them

REX

(sincerely sorry)
Go

Sarah and JJ look confused as Finn rounds the corner to see
Rex standing there blocking Finn’s way with a kitchen
knife

FINN
Outta the way

REX
It’s over

Rex doesn’t budge as Finn lifts his gun JJ and Sarah
slowly move back getting a head start

It’s just Rex and Finn now

FINN
Move

Rex charges him like a wild animal wielding his kitchen
knife

But before he gets close Finn FIRES and Rex falls to the
ground Dead

SARAH
Rex

JJ freezes horrified Finn looks at JJ and Sarah down the
hall and then bolts toward them

JT
Mom-- come on

JJ leads his mom down the hallway and into --

INT TRIANGLE ROOM - SAME

JJ grabs the REMOTE CONTROL from Shane’s car that rests on
the desk

JT
Hide

JJ moves for the HIDDEN CELL DOOR that we saw earlier

INT SMALL ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Finn enters the room He looks around but JJ and Sarah are
gone It’s empty save an old desk

Finn moves for the desk He knows they must be behind it
FINN
You ain’t leavin’ with my meal
ticket
Just as Finn’s about to round the desk he hears the sound
of someone moving He turns to see that hidden DOOR to the
CELL quickly shut

Finn moves for the door

FINN
Come on out

He opens it to see a SHOESTRING tied around the inside door
handle He pulls the string and finds a REMOTE CONTROL CAR
at the end of it used to shut the door from the inside
Before he can realize the trap JJ appears from behind Finn
and SHOVES him inside the room locking it closed from the
outside

Now inside the cell Finn SLAMS his fist against the door
but there’s no way out

He’s trapped in the tiny room
Outside the door Sarah stands up from behind the desk

JI
Let’s go--

JJ grabs his mom and goes

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Allie bloody and broken struggles to stand as Gabe walks
towards her In the background Brian fades in and out of
consciousness too weak to help

GABE
Enough games

Allie rises to her feet revealing the FLINTLOCK PISTOL in
her hand pointed right at his face

GABE
Well played

She has Gabe’s attention but he’s not scared
In a flash he GRABS the Flintlock Pistol from her hand

Allie SWINGS her arms -- CLAWING at Gabe’s face and ripping
skin from his cheek with her fingernails --

But Gabe just THROWS her on the floor --

GABE
Stay down

Allie tries to get up but she’s weak Giving it
everything she has she slowly stands Dizzy Swaying

GABE
(amused)
Stupid girl

Gabe points the gun at Allie’s forehead She manages to
steady herself staring right at him

ALLIE
Do it

She’s wrecked drenched in dirt blood and sweat

ALLIE
Shoot

Gabe COCKS the trigger

ALLIE
Come on You’ve already taken my
dad Shoot me
And then

GABE
Merry Christmas

Gabe PULLS THE TRIGGER and the antique gun SPARKS --

In a massive flash of bright light Gabe’s rum-soaked shirt
goes up in flames

GABE

His entire body is on fire as he writhes in pain

Allie watches him burn before she moves to help Brian get
on his feet --

ALLIE
Brian

Brian finally gets up as the fire RAGES around them

Flames and smoke growing in intensity with every passing
second

ALLIE
Im here--

From the foyer Tiffany JJ and Sarah enter

JT
The whole place is coming down--

They help Brian up barely breathing
The group of them head towards the back but they barely
get a few feet when the ceiling begins to CRASH to the

ground in front of them

TIFFANY
Go back the other way

They stagger into the foyer but it’s crumbling down too

There’s nowhere to turn as the flames and falling debris
block their path

They’re trapped
And just when it seems all hope is lost

SOMEONE jumps through the wall of fire wrapped in a wet
cloth It’s Brian’s Dad --

BRIAN’S DAD
Come on

That’s when the other parents rush in all wrapped in
soaking wet cloth

TIFFANY’S DAD
Hurry

Together they all fight back the flames and run outside

EXT ROSEWOOD LODGE - BACK YARD - SAME

Just as they exit the lodge part of the roof collapses in
a ball of fire

But they did it They escaped

Allie looks back to the burning house as we hear the sound
of SIRENS approaching

INT INSIDE HOUSE - SAME

As we move through the flames we see the dead bodies
GABE

REX

AND ALLIE’S DAD

EXT ROSEWOOD LODGE - BACK YARD - SAME

The rest of the group stands there exhausted and bloody
No words are spoken as they all just watch the lodge go up
in smoke consumed by fire

JJ stays close to his mother holding hands with Tiffany
as Tiffany’s Dad and Mom stand nearby the tension palpable
between them

A few yards away Brian’s Mom and Shane huddle together
Brian’s Dad on the sidelines by himself

And then there’s Brian and Allie kneeling down Brian
reaches for Allie’s hand and she embraces him Their bond
deeper than ever

WE PULL BACK from the destruction of the scene

THROUGH THE SMOKE AND FLAMES

And into the starry night air

Where that JOYFUL JINGLE BELLS SONG we heard in the opening
credits begins again

ROLL CREDITS

FADE IN

EXT ROSEWOOD LODGE - MORNING
The fire has subsided as emergency crews clean up the mess

On the far side of the building under a pile of rubble
some debris moves ever so slightly

Then a piece of wood slides down and we see a small SQUARE
BRICK “BOX” just sitting there

The small door opens and we realize that this box is the
HOLDING CELL from the triangle room

After a moment he exits

FINN His clothes are tattered and his skin burnt Eyes
filled with rage He looks like a monster now

Finn spots a gurney with a scorched and blistered body
being loaded into an ambulance

Fury in his eyes when he realizes it’s his BROTHER
Revenge on his mind
Finn prowls into the woods and we --

SMASH TO BLACK
