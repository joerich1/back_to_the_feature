Vampyr

A man is walking down the narrow riverside path that winds its way towards
the spot where a ferry crosses to the other bank It is a summer evening
after sunset The traveler Nikolas is carrying a rucksack and in his hand
a pair of fishing rods He wants to spend his holiday in solitude which is
why he has come to this remote region in search of peace

He arrives at the old inn and finds the door closed The inn is lying in
profound silence as if all its occupants have gone to bed Nikolas rattles
at the door but it is well and truly locked At this moment he sees a reaper
walking along with his scythe over his shoulder He looks at the man
curiously as he walks down towards the ferry He shouts after him

NIKOLAS
Hello you there

But the reaper not hearing his cry continues on his way The landscape is
bathed in a gray dim twilight every object has a tinge of unreality
Nikolas goes round to the back of the house There he discovers a window in
which a light can be seen He comes nearer knocks on the window pane and
listens but not a sound reaches him Simultaneously the light goes out
Nikolas knocks again Silence still But now a window is opened quietly on
the floor above and a timid childs voice asks

CHILDS VOICE
Whos there

Nikolas runs his eye up the facade of the house and discovers a little girl
of thirteen with a gentle frightened face She says to him

GIRL
Ill come down and open the door

She gestures indicating that he is to go to the front door Then she
carefully closes the window

As Nikolas stands waiting he glances down in the direction of the ferry The
ferryman - who has a white beard - boards the ferry-boat which begins
crossing the river He goes backwards and forwards pulling laboriously at
the iron chains which run rattling and squealing round the ungreased wheels

Meanwhile the little girl has opened the door of the inn She is a strange
child She looks rather small for her age and wears spectacles Her eyes are
moist as if she has just been crying When she talks to somebody she tilts
her head backwards

Nikolas enters and the girl shuts the door behind him He slips his rucksack
from off his shoulders As he is doing so a door opens a few inches and a
face appears staring inquisitively The little girl gives a sign to Nikolas
to follow her up the stair leading to the guest rooms She lights a candle in
a little enamel candlestick of the kind found in country districts and hands
him the candlestick

On the floor above the doors out onto the passage are standing open The
rooms are poorly furnished the beds without bedclothes the windows dirty
as if they have not been cleaned for a long time The little girl conducts
Nikolas to a spartanly furnished room On a table he finds a candlestick with
a half-used candle beside which are lying another candle and a box of
matches He lights the candle The girl who has remained standing in the
doorway says with an inclination of the head

GIRL
Good night sir

NIKOLAS
Good night

The girl disappears and shuts the door behind her He glances round the room
Over the bed hangs one of those copperplate engravings framed in glass that
are so common in the country Nikolas looks at the engraving for a moment It
represents something like Death pays a call Then from a neighboring room
he hears a woman sobbing

Close-up Nikolas turning and listening He opens the door a few inches A
mans voice is heard trying to calm the woman but she is incapable of
mastering her despair She breaks out in a voice choked with tears

WOMANS VOICE
Oh why did he have to die - why should I have
to lose him why why

MANS VOICE
(consolingly)
Dont cry

WOMANS VOICE
(in despair)
My little boy my little boy

The weeping eases off

WOMANS VOICE
Oh God oh God

We hear a door opening followed by footsteps then everything is quiet
again

Nikolas who had lifted the light to look at the engraving puts it down and
after locking the door crosses to the window to pull down the blind First
however he looks out across the river where he sees the reaper with the
scythe sitting on the railing of the ferry-boat while the ferryman continues
his monotonous progress up and down like the ferryman on the river separating
life and death Then Nikolas draws down the blind It is one of those blinds
often seen in the country that have some painted motif a temple a forest
or the like He takes out his watch The sound of the watch continues during
the following shot which shows the shadow of the house creeping slowly over
the ground - a symbol of time passing

A moment later we return to the room Nikolas has been asleep for some time
Somewhere in the house a clock strikes eleven then we hear the footsteps of
somebody approaching and knocking on the door two knocks - and again two

knocks In his deep sleep Nikolas seems to hear the knocking without taking
it in fully He reacts while still half asleep turns his head towards the
door and sees the handle slowly turning Then the door is opened inch by
inch as if by an invisible hand A man enters the room wearing a full-
length dressing-gown Without a sound he approaches the bed and leans over
Nikolas

MAN
Are you asleep

Almost unconsciously Nikolas opens his eyes and meets the strangers
enquiring gaze

MAN
Wake up

Nikolas looks at him in astonishment and asks almost in a whisper

NIKOLAS
Who are you

The stranger whose whole bearing and behavior indicate unease and
nervousness straightens up crosses the room pulls up the blind and stands
so that the moonlight falls on his face which shows traces of recent
suffering He takes out a handkerchief and mops his brow with a nervous
movement like a man dreading a catastrophe Then he says

MAN

Sh

Nikolas looks at him in growing amazement The stranger continues to stand
there as if his thoughts are somewhere quite apart Then he seems to
remember where he is and why he has come He again goes right up to the bed
and leans over Nikolas In broken syllables he stammers out the words

MAN
She mustnt die do you hear Shes
dying shes dying

The stranger speaks like a man in dire need one who in his agony doesnt
know where to turn for help Suddenly - without transition he turns away and
crosses to the door There he stops apparently absorbed in his own thoughts
Absently he raises a thumb to his lips looks at it and licks it Then he
puts

a hand in his dressing-gown pocket and takes out a parcel the size of a book
He puts the parcel down takes his leave with a polite inclination of the
head and goes out

Nikolas sits half up in bed tormented by doubt Has he been dreaming Has
there really been anybody in his room He lights a match and looks at his
watch It is five past eleven Then he gets up goes to the door and tries
it it is firmly locked He looks at the blind the blind is up And on the
table lies the parcel Some words are written on it

To be opened after my death

Nikolas is unable to go back to sleep A dying man has called on him He
cannot ignore this call He must go and look for the man who has asked for
help He starts putting his clothes on

Outside the shadow of the inn creeps further and further over the ground -
time is passing

Nikolas has crept stealthily down the stairs and stolen out of the door
without waking the people in the inn The moon is shining so that everything
is clearly visible He takes a few steps then stops irresolutely Which way
shall he go It is in truth a hopeless task that he has undertaken since
this stranger has given him no information whatsoever As he stands like
this
he suddenly catches sight of a shadow gliding down the white road It is the
shadow of a man - a man with a wooden leg - followed by the shadow of a dog
Nikolas stands stock-still for a moment utterly bewildered Yes it quite
definitely is a shadow - and only a shadow There is no man or dog to

be seen The mans shadow stops turns slowly and looks all round With
mounting astonishment Nikolas watches to see what will happen next

The mans shadow walks on and joins a group of other shadows engaged in
digging a grave in the shadow of a tree We see these shadows of grave
diggers as they dig their shovels deep in the earth and throw up shadows of
shovelfuls onto a heap of earth which likewise is a shadow One of the
shadows in the grave stops when the shadow of the man with the dog comes up
to him After a short conversation between the two men the shadow of the man
with the dog turns takes a few paces in the direction whence he came and
beckons to somebody

Z
pe

olas looks in the same direction and sees a weird procession two mens
adows sharply outlined against the light road walking slowly along
arrying a dead body The limply hanging arms and dangling legs show clearly
at it is a human body The whole procession of shadows is utterly

ntastic

olas follows the happenings with the keenest attention the shadow of the
an with the dog gives an order they start laying the body in the grave

en the shadow of the man with the dog moves away

ca Zactaoa
Bo

pe

olas has an impulse to follow this shadow A voice inside him tells him

at there must be some connection between the apparition in the room of the
nn and this phenomenon of the shadows He follows the shadow which suddenly
eaves the road and disappears through a door or opening in the wall of a
actory This factory is strictly speaking only the ruins of a factory

ich has been derelict for many years Half of the window panes are broken
nd those remaining are covered in dirt and cobwebs The tumble-down factory
ooks dismal and fantastic in the moonlight and makes one think of a gigantic
urchyard

QHMZmMrREHEAe

Nikolas enters the factory by the same opening through which the shadow
disappeared The room Nikolas enters is a small bare square room full of
rubble and stones through which Nikolas carefully threads his way There are
two doors Nikolas tries one which leads into a room with no other exit
then he opens the other and comes into a room with another door When Nikolas
opens this latter door he finds a steep staircase behind it Nikolas treads
gingerly on the stairs to see if they creak then he goes up the stairs When
he reaches the top he finds himself facing another door Just as he is about
to open this he hears through the door footsteps echoing over the tiled
floor Nikolas stands rooted to the spot The steps come nearer and as they
do so we see under the door a steadily increasing shaft of light He can hear

that they are the footsteps of a man He watches the door as if hypnotized
The man on the other side has stopped now the door handle moves and a key
is turned Then the footsteps die away

Nikolas who has hardly dared to draw breath for fear of giving himself away
tries the door handle To his surprise the door opens The man whose steps
can no longer be heard has evidently unlocked the door for an expected
visit

Nikolas opens the door wide and goes in He finds himself in a room
resembling

a corridor A little way along there is a door Nikolas tiptoes up to it and
opens it The room into which it leads is empty Nikolas is about to turn
back into the corridor when he hears a door slam He peeps out through the
partly open door There now enters by the door through which he himself has
passed a moment ago an old woman of erect bearing who holds her head high
and proudly She must be very old Her skin is pale as wax yellowish and
drawn tight over her cheek-bones Her movements are stiff and resolute she
supports herself on a stick which strikes the tiles with sharp regular
clicks The old woman is blind Her eyes are covered with a film and have a
dead look Her lips are thin Her whole face bears the stamp of cruelty

The moonlight shines through the window outlining its cruciform frame
sharply on the floor or the wall When the blind woman reaches the window
she opens it with her stick before continuing on her way and the shadow of
the cross disappears She goes through the door behind which Nikolas has
hidden and he decides to follow her Suddenly she stops throws her head
back and sniffs the air like a dog Nikolas stops too She turns abruptly and
says

BLIND WOMAN
Whos there

Nikolas waits as quiet as a mouse The blind woman is reassured and walks on
Nikolas follows But at the first turn of the corridor she vanishes

Nikolas stands speechless for a moment Then another remarkable thing
happens a sound which has no connection with the preceding scene reaches his
ear It is the sound of music and the tune being played has a dancing
rhythm faintly reminiscent of a slow mazurka Nikolas listens for a second
then takes a few steps in the direction of the sound and turns into a
corridor at the end of which there is a door When he opens this it is as
if the music cooped up behind the closed door now rushes at him like a wave
falling back to its original level The music seems to come from some
apertures in the wall They are like organ pipes at all events the music
swells from them as from an enormous organ The same blind woman now appears
in a corner of the room She stops She makes a sign with her stick and the
music stops

From the opposite corner of the room a curious figure now comes towards her
a lame man as thin as a beanstalk But in spite of his lameness he moves with
great agility he looks remarkably like a great wading bird Involuntarily he
uncovers his head and holds his hat in his hand while talking to the blind
woman She gives him a curt order and walks on finally disappearing in the
factorys labyrinth of passages and corridors

The shadow of the man with the wooden leg sits down on a bench on which his
real ego is also sitting A man comes up to him They whisper together
The new arrival is an unpleasant character with pigs eyes a flat nose a
low forehead and sparse stiff bristles He has an underhung jaw and a
powerful chin There is something bestial about his appearance The two men
walk over to a window niche where a man is lying asleep on the floor
huddled up like a dog As the one-legged man wakes the sleeper with a kick
from his wooden leg the man with the pigs eyes pulls out his knife and
tests the cutting edge with his thumb The sleeper has sharp features and a
hardened expression as if his face has been carved in wood As he gets up he
scratches his unshaven cheek with a bent forefinger Then all three
disappear

Nikolas catches sight of a little house an old deserted dwelling with
windows which have been painted over white and which in the moonlight
resemble glass eyes

He goes into the house and enters a corridor There is a smell of mold
Everything is old dirty and dilapidated Dust and cobwebs in every corner
Perhaps inhabited perhaps not very little furniture An old cupboard a
chair an umbrella lacking its cover a greasy hat on a hat rack In the
corridor there is a door with reinforced panes of glass the corridor leads
to a staircase descending to the gloomy depths of a cellar There is a death-
like hush in the house

NIKOLAS
Is there anybody here

asks Nikolas in a loud voice

No answer The silence seems even deeper after the sound of his own voice
Opposite the staircase a door is standing ajar Nikolas opens it cautiously
The room he looks into is peculiar in the extreme It is depressingly untidy
and dirty Collections of eggs birds and mussel shells distilling-flasks
and glasses of all sizes dusty and filthy some spiders under glass cases a
doctors scales with weights the color of verdigris books apothecarys
glasses containing leeches and other crawling things The skeleton of a
child A parrot on its perch But not a single living human being

Nikolas goes through a door into another room As he does so he gets the
feeling that there must have been people here quite recently In the middle
of the floor stands a black wooden coffin on two wooden trestles On the
floor wood shavings and bricks on the window ledge a bowl of dirty water
soap a brush and a comb and standing against the wall a saw and other
carpenters tools Nikolas goes through this room in turn The houses
inhospitable atmosphere is beginning to oppress him he has the feeling that
he is not alone even if the room is empty He walks on tiptoe looks all
round and opens and closes the doors cautiously

The third room is completely empty Dust is lying so thick that it muffles
the sound of his footsteps Flakes of plaster are lying on the floor they
have peeled off from the wall and ceiling on which there are rusty stains
made by the rain dripping from the leaky roof In the window there is a
potted plant hanging withered from its stake

Facing him a door This leads into a room with a tiled floor which makes the
echo sound harsh and cold Some large boxes bar his way Then he suddenly
thinks he sees directly opposite a long corridor opening out of a wall with
no door in it
When he reaches it there is no entrance after all but an uninterrupted
wall into which he has bumped he lights a cigarette by the light of which
he sees that he is standing close up against a whitewashed wall which is
split cracked and full of mold He turns round and discovers that he is now
in an old laundry room It has not been used since time immemorial
Everything is covered in dust On the copper are standing some rusty bird-
cages and mousetraps Old paraffin lamps are lying in a heap on the floor
but what astonishes Nikolas most is a collection of childrens clogs standing
neatly in rows They are not quite as dusty as the other things in the old
laundry room

For this reason he goes through the empty room and back to the spot where a
door leads out to the staircase There he stops and now he hears - in the
quivering stillness of the old house - hounds baying and a child weeping
Then a scream a half-suppressed childs scream as if a hand had closed over
the mouth of the screamer

It comes from the cellar but just as Nikolas is about to descend he hears
steps on the staircase above Somebody is coming down He sees only this
persons hand as it fumbles its way slowly down the handrail He can only
guess at the owner of the hand The hand continues to glide down and
Nikolas summoning all his courage says

NIKOLAS
Good evening

But the hand only rises and gestures to him to be quiet The person stops on
the staircase Not a sound Then the hand resumes its downward gliding
movement Nikolas realizes that it is the hand of an old man The figure
continues down to the staircase landing and Nikolas takes a few steps
towards him He sees that it is a slender elderly man His hair hangs in
tangled wisps He pokes his head forward in an attentive attitude He is
wearing spectacles and his face is marked by unctuous servility coupled
with relentless malignity He looks like a usurer This man is Marc At this
moment everything about him indicates that he is listening

NIKOLAS

But Marc interrupts him with a violent movement and bid him be quiet

MARC
Sh

He continues to the staircase leading down to the cellar descends two steps
and leans over the handrail - we see his neck - and stands there for a long
time listening as he leans towards the depths Then he comes back up to
Nikolas and his gaze is fixed and tense

MARC
Did you hear

NIKOLAS
Yes the child

But now Marcs bearing changes He looks as if he has woken from the hypnotic
state which his intense interest in the cellar has induced He suddenly
becomes aware that he is facing a stranger His face clouds over with
suspicion

MARC
(sharply)
The child
NIKOLAS
Yes
MARC

Theres no child here

NIKOLAS
But the dogs

During this exchange he has more or less pushed Nikolas before him to the
front door without ever actually touching him But his intention is clear
enough

MARC
Theres no child here and no dogs either

NIKOLAS
No
MARC
No
(opening the front door)
Good night

Marc has succeeded in getting rid of Nikolas and without further comment he
shuts the door

ikolas stands irresolutely for a moment outside the door while he reflects
n his visit to this extraordinary house Then he sets off slowly down the
oad until at a turn of the road he catches sight of the three disembodied
adows that took their orders in the factory from the blind woman The group
s recognizable by the man with the wooden leg Nikolas follows the three
adows feeling instinctively that they will lead him to the man who has
sked him for help

M9HEAKOZ

n the house meanwhile Marc has turned back to the stairs From the depths
f the cellar he hears steps approaching and the sound of a stick striking
e ground with great servility he greets the blind woman as she comes up
e stairs

atOowH

Marc follows her with exaggerated and ill-placed attentiveness He opens for
her the door into the consulting-room and closes it behind her The blind
woman continues on her way without taking any notice of him Her head is
tilted back slightly as is often done by blind people She moves forward
cold and unbending As she crosses the consulting-room she is on the point
of stumbling over a large box lying open on the floor Marc kicks it
hurriedly aside and draws up a chair for her at the table She ignores him
completely When she sits down he takes her stick and puts it carefully on
the table Marc stands motionless and expectant Then she slowly takes a

medicine bottle from her pocket With her bony hand she holds it out to Marc
When he takes it she raises her face towards him for the first time He looks
at her they appear to exchange a conspiratorial glance an order is given
and received

At this moment an explosion of laughter is heard from the parrot Marc tears
off his spectacles - which rest a little way down his nose - polishes them
and gives the parrot a near-sighted malicious and knowing look Then he goes
to a shelf on which he places the medicine bottle with the poison label

We go from the sinister house to a neighboring castle A shot of the road
where we see Nikolas on his way to the castle

The camera moves to a certain window on the ground floor of the castle
behind which we see a man getting up and taking a lamp This is the man who
at the inn visited Nikolas in a dream We can call him Bernard He leaves
the room

THE INTERIOR OF THE CASTLE

Bernard enters a room arranged as a sick-room A woman is lying there in bed
it is his daughter whose name is Léone A nurse is looking after her Léone
is a woman of twenty-six She is very pale as if suffering from anemia
Bernard goes up to the bed The nurse stands beside him and says

NURSE
The wounds are nearly healed

Bernard holds the lamp so that the light falls on Léones throat In the
middle of her throat where the jugular vein shows blue under the white skin
we see two small marks reminiscent of those that appear after a cat- or rat-
bite There have been two wounds but they are now closing and healing
Bernard prepares to go He turns in the door because Léone has stirred She
moves her lips as if in a horrible dream and her face takes on an expression
of terror She stammers out

LEONE
The blood The blood

Then she seems to calm down Bernard goes back to the bed Léone opens her
eyes recognizes her father gives him a feeble smile and takes his hand
Bernard looks at her with intensely serious eyes It is evident that even if
he does not know the cause of her condition he has his suspicions about it
He takes a last look at his daughter and goes In the door he turns to the
nurse

BERNARD
You mustnt lie down and go to sleep until the
doctor has been here

The nurse promises not to do so As he closes the door Léone moves again
The nurse watches her closely

THE CASTLE
Léones sick-room The nurse puts a chair by the bed

THE PARK OF THE CASTLE
Nikolas jumps up on the wall ringing the castle When he appears on the wall
his body forms a ghostly silhouette against the night sky (to suggest the
shadows he is pursuing)

THE COURTYARD
The three shadows emerge from the shadow of the trees steal across the
moonlit courtyard and disappear into the deep shadows of the castle

THE CASTLE
Bernard in the corridor outside the door of his room He still has the lamp
in his hand He goes into his room

THE COURTYARD

Enter Nikolas (from another direction than the three shadows we saw in an
earlier shot) He finds himself under the room that Bernard has just entered
Through the lighted window he sees Bernard putting down his lamp and
recognizes him as the man who visited him in his dreams At the same moment
he sees the three shadows going diagonally across the ceiling of the room at
that moment Bernard leaves the window and goes across to a bookshelf Nikolas
rushes to the main door of the castle He rings vigorously at the door The
bell gives a feeble ring The echo dies away and everything is quiet again
Nikolas rings again Now he hears behind the door an old persons shuffling
steps He tugs at the door and shouts

NIKOLAS
Open up open up quickly hurry

The door remains closed but inside he hears

A VOICE
Who is it
NIKOLAS
For Gods sake hurry theyre killing

him

Then the door opens but only a few inches Through the chink we see old
Joseph a faithful manservant He is wearing only trousers and a shirt which
is open at the neck His braces are hanging down his back He is carrying a
lamp in his hand The manservant wants to know more but at this very moment
a long-drawn-out scream is heard hideous and horrifying For a moment this
scream seems to paralyze the two men The manservant puts his hand to his
mouth in order not to scream himself Mechanically he opens the door wide
The two men rush into the house

THE STAIRCASE LANDING OUTSIDE LEONES ROOM

The nurse opens the door in terror Her facial contortions show that the
invalid has heard nothing but that on the other hand she dare not leave her
either

THE DRAWING-ROOM

This adjoins Bernards room The manservant and Nikolas try to open the door
into Bernards room but the body of the dying man is lying just behind the
door preventing them from opening it more than a few inches The dying mans
screams fill them with horror

MANSERVANT
The other door
He gives Nikolas the lamp and hurries out to the other entrance to the room
containing the dying man When the manservant goes into the room he finds
his master slumped up against the door with one hand still clutching the
door handle convulsively as if trying to escape the lethal weapon which has
struck him just as he reached the door His screams give way to gasps and he
has difficulty in breathing Nikolas has put the lamp on the piece of
furniture nearest the door Now he comes up and at a sign from the
manservant makes the murdered man release his grip on the door handle The
dying man tries desperately to open his eyes and speak Then it grows quiet
and in the silence only his labored breathing can be heard Suddenly he gives
a deep sigh at the same time opening his eyes and looking frantically
around He looks up at Nikolas An expression of surprise lights up his face
for a moment The manservant has intercepted this look and glances curiously
at Nikolas But the dying mans stare again becomes fixed and glassy He
stammers

BERNARD
Water

Nikolas gets up on a table he finds a tray with cups and a jug of linden
tea He pours out a little tea in a cup which he lowers to the dying man
With a teaspoon he moistens the dying mans lips

While Nikolas has been occupied with the tray an old serving woman has
arrived at the door connecting the death-room with the drawing-room It is
the housekeeper of the castle the wife of the old manservant they tell her
to come in by the other door She enters with the chamber-maid The old
housekeeper moves her hands incessantly under her motley apron

On the staircase landing the nurse is still standing terror-stricken
outside the open door of Léones room listening and staring out into the
darkness Then Giséle appears wearing an apron-like dress the sleeves of
which are gathered in a tight band round her wrists A very simple and
slightly old-fashioned dress which can easily be turned into a kimono She
thinks the scream has come from the sick-room and is surprised to find the
nurse on the stairs

GISELE
Wasnt it her

NURSE
No its down there

The nurse listens for sounds in Léones room while Giséle runs down the
stairs

BERNARDS ROOM

Enter Giséle She stops dead by the door paralyzed by the sight of her
father lying on the point of death She looks at the chamber-maid and the old
housekeeper who are clinging to each other while the tears run down their
cheeks Beside herself and with eyes dilated with terror she goes to her
father and kneels by his side He understands that she is there His face
lights up for a moment after which he closes his eyes again for a while as
if trying to draw breath for the few words he wants to say but he has not
sufficient strength left He uses his last ounce of strength to draw a ring
from his finger He hands the ring to Giséle who recognizes it It is a
signet ring the signet of which is formed like a tiny gold cross She holds
it in the hollow of her hand while her eyes fill with tears The dying man
catches Giséles eye and as it were guides it over to Nikolas as if to say
This man will protect you His gaze becomes vacant without consciousness
fixed and glassy His breathing comes in jerks Nikolas tries to moisten his
lips but the liquid runs down his chin and thence onto his breast His teeth
are firmly clenched and the corners of his mouth are sagging The brief
death-struggle has begun While we see the little group by the door which
has been joined by the old coachman we hear the dying mans death-rattle
Tears run down the coachmans furrowed cheeks

ON THE LANDING
The nurse is still standing there The death-rattle reaches her ears She
goes into Léones room and shuts the door behind her

BERNARDS ROOM

Here the silence of death prevails The group by the door follows with bated
breath the last spasms of the death-struggle Now the murdered lord of the
castle is drawing his last gasp The old housekeeper goes up to Giséle who
is no longer weeping but merely stares uncomprehendingly at her fathers
lifeless body The old housekeeper calls to her gently Giséle looks at her
in surprise

GISELE
Is he dead

The old woman nods Giséle looks once more at her fathers face then bursts
into tears and without offering any resistance lets herself be led across to
the wall where she collapses into a chair throwing her arms round the old

woman and clinging to her hand She says nothing She only weeps and weeps

The coachman goes out

Nikolas and the manservant carry the dead man across to a sofa While the
manservant is still in the room Nikolas goes up to Giséle He helps the maid
to lead Giséle away The latter is led out unresisting He takes her by the
arm She hides her face in her hands and weeps heart-rendingly The
manservant remains in the room He walks round in a curiously restless way
he makes a number of unconscious movements with his hands as if wanting to
make somebody or other keep quiet

THE COURTYARD

The coachman crosses the courtyard opens the door of the carriage entrance
and draws out a hunting carriage He pulls it slowly and carefully as if
wanting to muffle the sound

THE DRAWING-ROOM

The old housekeeper has gone on ahead in order to light a lamp Nikolas gets
Giséle to sit down Her gaze is vacant and the only sound that comes from
her is a suppressed sobbing

Nikolas walks to and fro in this ante-chamber of death deeply disturbed by
the scene he has just witnessed As he reaches the door the old housekeeper
is standing in front of him

HOUSEKEEPER
(in a low voice)
Couldnt you stay here until
Nikolas replies with a movement of his head then continues to pace the
floor

THE COURTYARD
The coachman leads a horse from the stable

THE DRAWING-ROOM

Nikolas stops in front of Giséles chair and looks compassionately at her
She is sitting as motionless as a stone Only her lips are trembling as if
she is praying quietly Suddenly she senses his presence She looks up at him
imploringly and says in a voice choked with tears

GISELE
Its so dark here

He takes out some matches and lights the lamps on an old piano which is
covered with a faded green silk cloth The only sound is the monotonous tick-
tock of an old clock which suggests the dull beating of an almost exhausted
heart

THE COURTYARD
The coachman is hitching the horses

THE DRAWING-ROOM

Nikolas lights another lamp and as he puts out the match he looks at Giséle
She is sitting with her hands in her lap rocking her head backwards and
forwards Her eyes are glazed She is doing all she can to prevent herself
from breaking down completely but when the first tears trickle down her
cheeks she breaks into sobs She lifts her clenched hands to her eyes and
weeps Nikolas goes over to her He knows that he can do absolutely nothing
however much he wants to quench her sorrow He bends over her as if wanting
to speak the words of consolation that she needs but before he can say
anything she bursts out

GISELE
How can anyone endure to live here

Nikolas strokes her hair and goes to the window from which he sees

THE COURTYARD
The coachman is putting on his cloak he sits up and drives the carriage out

THE DRAWING-ROOM

Giséle jumps up at the sound of the carriage In her anxious and overwrought
condition she endows every sound with meaning She goes to the window looks
out and asks

GISELE
Where is he going

NIKOLAS
To fetch the police

answers Nikolas

The sound of the carriage dies away but Giséle remains standing with her
face pressed against the window pane Nikolas goes to a lamp by the light of
which he takes out the sealed parcel that the stranger gave him in the inn
breaks the seal and finds a book Nikolas tiptoes over to a chair lifts it
carefully turns it towards the lamplight and sits down without a sound
Sitting there he begins to read the book from the beginning

LEONES ROOM

Léone is lying in bed The nurse is sitting in the room with her sewing
things Suddenly she raises her eyes A number of little furrows have
appeared on Léones forehead Her breathing becomes irregular and labored
Her face is twisted as if she is tormented by fear and uncertainty She
opens her eyes and her gaze is fixed and distant as if held by someone a
long way away She looks like a medium under hypnosis She is visibly no
longer master of her own will or she is under the influence of a power
stronger than her own In spite of her weakened condition she raises herself
on her elbow and shouts very loudly

LEONE
Yes yes

as if someone has called to her The nurse has put aside her sewing things
and is throwing off the blanket in which she has wrapped herself for the
night Outside the dog howls - penetrating long-drawn-out howls Léone
raises herself still further until she is sitting on the edge of the bed

LEONE
Yes Im coming

The nurse hurries over to her but Léone who moves just like somebody
hypnotized is on her way to the door The nurse blocks her path by pushing a
chair in front of her The nurse stands before her and stares hard at her to
catch her eye The chair prevents Léone from advancing The nurse tries
gently to wake her as one talks to a child crying in its sleep

NURSE
Youre dreaming youre dreaming

Now a remarkable change comes over Léone her tense expression relaxes The
hypnotic suggestion gradually seems to lose its hold on her as if the other
party has suddenly reconsidered and decided to wait for a better opportunity
She returns to her normal state of mind She looks in surprise at the nurse
who leads her gently back to bed Léone offers no resistance and even
cooperates actively in getting into bed The nurse sits down beside her

NURSE
What were you dreaming about

LEONE
A voice

NURSE
That spoke to you

LEONE
That called commanded

NURSE
What did it say
Léone makes no reply

Her eyelids close again To all appearances she is sleeping the deep sound
sleep of an over-tired child The nurse watches her anxiously This peaceful
and apparently quite normal sleep inspires her with fear rather than
confidence She goes into the adjoining room to rinse some medicine bottles
and the like At almost the same moment Léone wakes up with a start She
listens intently for the previous distant call without a word she hurriedly
throws off the blanket and steals out - so quietly that the nurse suspects
nothing

THE DRAWING-ROOM
Giséle at the window with her forehead pressed against the cold pane Nikolas

is sitting reading the book

Giséle suddenly raises her head and looks out in the park

GISELE
Léone
Nikolas looks up
GISELE
Look Look There in the park

Nikolas hurries over to the window The next moment they rush out into the
hall here they are joined by the manservant and the nurse who come down the
stairs in great agitation

NIKOLAS
Take the lantern

He points to the lantern which the coachman has left at the foot of the
stairs The manservants wife the old housekeeper comes in with her
husbands jacket He hastily puts it on Then they all hurry out to

THE PARK
By the time they are out there Léone is nowhere to be seen They begin a
thorough search of the park which looks ghostly with its moonlit sandstone
statues Some of the tree trunks are painted white They look like skeletons
swaying backwards and forwards Spiders webs shine like silver From time to
time a bird flies off in alarm We begin by following the manservant as he
makes his way through bushes and undergrowth with the lantern held high over
his head like a luminous hour-glass With his free hand he holds his jacket
tightly round his neck In the distance we hear Giséle shouting anxiously

GISELE
Léone Léone

We see the old housekeeper standing on the stairs and looking out into the
park Giséles cries can still be heard Now we follow Nikolas and Giséle
who are together Suddenly Nikolas stops and calls to Giséle He points out a
group at some distance from them On a stone table covered with ivy a white
figure is lying prostrate Bending over her a dark shape can be dimly
discerned - as far as can be judged that of an old woman The white figure
is lying in such a way that its head hangs over the edge of the table and
the attitude of the dark figure suggests that its lips must be in contact
with the prostrate womans throat

Nikolas and Giséle terror-stricken make for the spot Now the dark figure
appears to notice them Like a dog when it is disturbed the figure turns its
head irritably and stares at the newcomers with the dead eyes of a blind
person With a grimace resembling nothing so much as a snarl it bends down
again over Léone but straightens up once more as if abandoning its plan and
just as it looks as if it will turn away and go it dissolves into thin air
Nikolas and Giséle have reached the stone table It is indeed Léone Giséle
is already at her side She looks in perplexity at Léones thrown-back head
There is a gentle expression on Léones lips which are parted in a peaceful
smile Her hands are hanging down white and limp She looks in every respect
as if she is dead Nikolas puts his ear to her mouth to listen to her
breathing which is very weak Giséle cups Léones face carefully in
her hands and turns it towards her

GISELE
Léone Léone

Léone slowly opens her eyes and looks for a long time in astonishment at
Giséle who says in a disappointed imploring voice

GISELE
But its me Giséle

Léones eyelids close again Only a narrow strip of white can be seen between
the closed eyelids Giséle shows signs of wanting to call Léone back to
consciousness

NIKOLAS
Dont wake her

At the same moment the manservant comes up and Nikolas takes the lantern
from his hand letting the light fall on Léones face

GISELE
Look blood

And she points at Léones throat The manservant opens his eyes wide and
leans forward to look Then he takes Léone in his arms as if she was a
child and carries her to the castle At the entrance the housekeeper is
waiting The nurse brings her a shawl or blanket the housekeeper runs to
meet the group and wraps Léone in the blanket The little procession is now
approaching the house Nikolas runs on ahead to open the double door The
nurse goes up to the sick-room shuts the windows and arranges the bed
Meanwhile the manservant carries Léone up the stairs Giséle follows behind
Nikolas shuts the double door goes into the drawing-room and continues his
reading of the diary His jaw is set in determination A page of the book is
shown

LEONES ROOM

The manservant has laid Léone on the bed and now goes out The nurse settles
Léone and discovers the wound in her throat she takes a wad of cotton-wool
moistens it with a disinfectant rinse from a bottle and dabs the liquid on
the wound Léone shudders convulsively puts her hand on the wound and
groans The nurse goes out

GISELE
(calling softly)
Léone Léone

Léone wakes up but seems not to recognize Giséle She looks at her sister as
if she has just woken from an evil and hideous dream Then suddenly she seems
to realize where she is She shivers puts her transparent hands to her face
and weeps silently

GISELE
(bending over her)
Why are you crying

Léone continues weeping for a little then she says

LEONE
I wish I was dead

GISELE
No no Léone

LEONE
(still weeping behind
her white hands)

Yes yes yes I am lost I am sinking
deeper and deeper into the darkness I am
afraid I am afraid

Giséle gives her a comforting pat on the arm Léone takes her hands from her
face The nurse returns Léone glances round the room as if looking for
somebody

LEONE
Where is

Giséle hardly knows how to answer she looks enquiringly at the nurse who
asks

NURSE
Your father

LEONE
Yes

NURSE
The master is asleep

Léone smiles gives a sigh of contentment and closes her eyes She sighs
again with relief and lies peacefully for a moment with closed eyes Then a
remarkable transformation occurs A deathly pallor spreads across her face
Her breathing becomes more rapid Her mouth opens Her lips tighten Then she
opens her eyes They are now hard almost malevolent Her face takes on an
expression of lust when she sees Giséle The latter shrinks away
uncomprehendingly seized with fear and pain The nurse gives her to
understand that she had better go
THE DRAWING-ROOM

Nikolas is there with the old housekeeper who with old-world courtesy brings
him a cup of strong coffee Just as she is handing Nikolas the cup Giséle
comes in With a distracted expression she shuts the door mechanically and
goes and sits down The old housekeeper puts the other cup down beside
Giséle who is completely absorbed by her recent strange experience The
other two look at her enquiringly

GISELE
(back in the present)
I think Léone is dying

The old housekeeper goes Giséle shakes her head like somebody trying to get
to the bottom of an insoluble mystery Nikolas takes the cup and puts it in
her hand Mechanically she takes a gulp and puts the cup down then she gives
a sudden start as if she has heard a piercing death-scream She sits for a
moment with her mouth agape and her eyes wide open Then she stands up
rushes to the window and looks out She seems surprised at not seeing
anything and turns towards Nikolas

GISELE
Didnt you hear something

Nikolas shakes his head goes up to her and forces her to sit down on a
chair but she cannot refrain from turning towards the window

NIKOLAS
Youre tired

He glances at her and turns back to his cup of coffee which he put down a
moment ago Now he puts it very carefully on the table An oppressive silence
has settled over the house

GISELE
Oh the silence

She presses her extended fingers against her breast as if trying to free it
from the pressure of the silence Nikolas watches her for a little Then he
goes to the piano and begins to play At the first touch she rises goes
slowly across the room and stands behind him She stands there with her hands
behind her back until the music finishes Then she says very quietly

GISELE
Thank you

A moment later she adds

GISELE
Ill try to get a little sleep

She takes a few steps turns and says

GISELE
Youre not leaving us I hope

Nikolas rises and goes close up to her She looks into his eyes like a
trusting child He gazes at her with infinite tenderness Then he bends down
and kisses her impulsively on the forehead She gives him a smile of
gratitude and goes into the adjoining room where she lies down on the sofa
and draws up a blanket over her Nikolas stands gazing after her A tear
trickles from the corner of his eye down his cheek From the other room he
hears her voice

GISELE
Play something more

He turns back to the piano and plays the same tune again Giséles eyelids
close She sleeps

As the last notes die away the old manservant enters the drawing-room
Nikolas hastily turns towards him and puts his finger to his lips as a
warning not to make any noise The manservant says quietly

MANSERVANT
The police are here

Outside can be heard faintly the noise of a carriage rumbling over the
cobbles in the courtyard Nikolas leaves the room together with the
manservant

THE COURTYARD

The two men emerge from the house and stand at the head of the steps The
carriage drives up the last few yards The horse walks as if sunk in its own
thoughts then it stops abruptly Joseph takes the lantern which has been
left on the steps and slowly approaches the carriage After a few paces he
stops Now he can see the whole carriage clearly and the coachman is alone

MANSERVANT
Are you alone

No answer He takes a few more steps and repeats his question

MANSERVANT
Are you alone

Still no answer Joseph turns to Nikolas who in the meantime has come
nearer They look more closely at the coachman who is sitting in a curious
position with his legs stretched out stiffly against the dashboard of the
carriage He has the reins in his hand but they are hanging loose Joseph
goes still nearer to the carriage and lifts the lantern The coachman is
sitting as if asleep Nikolas clambers up behind the coachmans seat Joseph
hands him the lantern which he holds in front of the coachmans face He
sees two staring glassy eyes Half-paralyzed with terror Nikolas hands the
lantern back to Joseph In the hope that the coachman is merely asleep
Nikolas puts his hand on his shoulder to waken him But at the first touch
the coachmans head sinks on his breast and his whole body slumps forward

Meanwhile the manservant has placed the lantern on the ground and as soon as
Nikolas has got down from the carriage the manservant draws his attention to
blood dripping from the floor of the carriage - drip drip

Both men stand for a moment as if hypnotized by this fearful new discovery
Then Nikolas hurries into the house During all this the other servants have
gathered round the carriage They shudder at the sight of the dead coachman
and stare at the horse which - with a corpse at the reins - has found its
way home unaided Joseph gets up onto the carriage

THE DRAWING-ROOM

Enter Nikolas He shuts the door very quietly behind him as if afraid that by
making the slightest noise he will bring about still worse misfortunes He
tiptoes to the piano and extinguishes the two lights on it As he is doing
this he cocks an ear to listen for Giséles breathing then he resumes his
reading of the diary a page of which is shown As he reads we hear in the
distance the sound of horses hooves on the paving stones also the sound
of the carriage being put away Then silence reigns again around the old
house Nikolas listens out into the silence Is he awake or are all these
fearful happenings merely a long horrible nightmare The heart of the old
clock is still beating After a moment a deep sigh is heard from a corner of
the room Nikolas looks in that direction A cello is standing there One of
the strings has slipped and as he looks at it another string breaks Then
silence again wraps its mantle round the room

Nikolas begins reading again but now the hideous piercing screech of the
doorbell is heard throughout the house Nikolas puts down his book goes to
the window and looks out There he sees a man who turns his back on him
Joseph comes running from the stable buildings Nikolas gathers that the
stranger must be the doctor for he and Joseph start discussing Léones
condition

DOCTOR
How is she

Joseph explains to him that things are going rather badly The young lady has
been found in the park In answer to the doctors exclamation of surprise
Joseph explains that she has climbed out of a window

DOCTOR
Was she alone then

MANSERVANT
Yes just for a moment

Meanwhile the doctor has come in followed by the manservant who is carrying
his bag for him When the doctor enters the ante-room Nikolas opens the
door The stranger who has hung up his hat turns round It is Marc whom
Nikolas met in the little house behind the factory They look hard at each
other for a moment

NIKOLAS
Good evening

DOCTOR MARC
Good evening

answers the doctor and it is he who eases the tension of the situation by
saying to the manservant

DOCTOR
Lets go try its high time
The doctor hurries to get in front of the manservant As soon as his back is
turned Nikolas goes up to the manservant and makes him understand that he is
to go in to Giséle The manservant goes into the drawing-room Nikolas runs
up the stairs behind the doctor

THE SICK-ROOM

The doctor hurries in and goes straight to the bed The nurses face takes on
an expression of fear She is giving the patient camphor Léone is paler than
before Her features are hard and sharp her lips blue It is painful to see
her and hear her breathing Beside herself the nurse turns to the doctor and
says

NURSE
Its going very badly

DOCTOR
(curtly)
Her pulse

NURSE
Very weak

The doctor lifts the patients eyelids then examines her lips and gums Next
he takes Léones wrist to feel her pulse As he does so he glances towards
the door where Nikolas is standing An expression of surprise passes across
the doctors face then he smiles the most fleeting of smiles He lets go of
Léones hand and looks closely at her face The nurse who has been following
his slightest movement asks anxiously

NURSE
Is she dying
DOCTOR
(seriously)

Yes

He takes a few steps away from the bed and seems to fall into deep thought
then he says as if talking to himself

DOCTOR
Perhaps we could save her

Nikolas and the nurse follow him with their eyes He speaks as if adding a
link to the chain of thought he is forging for himself

DOCTOR
Will you give her blood

The question is addressed to Nikolas He looks across at Léone He feels
certain the doctor is right and if he does not immediately declare himself
willing it is because his feelings are divided between the obvious need to
save Léone and his fear and uncertainty about this man He looks at the
nurse Her anxiety has disappeared and a gleam of confidence and hope shines
in her eyes

The doctor comes a step nearer and says emphasizing each word
DOCTOR
Immediately this very moment

Nikolas makes no reply He almost fails to notice the nurse whose face
reflects disappointment and sorrow The doctor looks at him for a moment
then turns away and shrugs his shoulders

Nikolas straightens up takes off his coat and rolls up one of his shirt
sleeves The nurse gets up with a happy smile and crosses to the table on
which are bottles and instruments The doctor however closes the door
behind Nikolas who has the feeling that he has let himself be caught ina
trap

THE DRAWING-ROOM

Joseph goes to the door of the room where Giséle is His face shows surprise
when he discovers Giséle on the sofa she is sitting motionless with her
legs drawn up under her and her head leaning back against the wall staring
fixedly at him with wide-open startled eyes As if talking to herself she
says

GISELE
Why does the doctor always come at night

The manservant goes up to her in order to calm her

THE SICK-ROOM
By the time we return there all the preparations for the blood transfusion
are completed

THE DRAWING-ROOM

Joseph returns from the room where Giséle is He has evidently succeeded in
calming her He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat He rests his
head in his hand He sees the open diary and begins reading it

THE SICK-ROOM
The blood transfusion is now in progress The only words are curt orders
like Now - Quickly - Thats enough - Give it to me - Sit still etc

THE DRAWING-ROOM

Joseph is reading the diary which arouses his interest more and more It is
as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that
have taken place around him An extract from the diary is shown

THE SICK-ROOM

The blood transfusion continues Marc has positioned himself outside the
circle of light from the lamp so that he can see Nikolas in bright light
while he himself sits in the dark Nikolas watches Léones face anxiously and
closely during her struggle with death Life slowly seems to return to her
and her breathing becomes more peaceful She opens her eyes and looks at the
people round her but she is much too enfeebled to speak and closes her eyes
again Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas who grows paler and paler His
eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to Nikolas again

THE DRAWING-ROOM
Another fragment of the diary is shown having to do with vampires

THE SICK-ROOM
The blood transfusion is completed While Marc himself is looking after the
patient the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room where she makes him
sit down and prepares his bandage The doctor stands bending over Léone

DOCTOR
Is he in a bad way

NURSE
(as she bandages Nikolas
Yes rather

DOCTOR
Give him a tablet

The nurse brings a tablet which she gives to Nikolas with a glass of water
He puts the glass down on a table near him Then she covers him up puts out
the lamp and goes into the sick-room the door of which is ajar leaving a
strip of light visible Meanwhile the nurse has been moving about putting
Léones room straight The doctor looks at her for a moment then he says

DOCTOR
You can lie down now and sleep Ill keep watch

The nurse continues working with great zeal The doctor now says to her in a
cutting almost hissing tone

DOCTOR
Did you hear what I said

The nurse looks at him in astonishment and encounters a cold stare She
realizes that there is no use in protesting it would be in vain She puts
aside what she has in her hands and goes off The doctor closes the door
after her and looks round the room

In the adjoining room Nikolas has dozed off He feels very weak In this
weakened condition he feels as if he is fainting which is curious because
at one and the same time he is both fully conscious and far away Suddenly he
wakes from his doze and stares open-mouthed at his bandaged arm The blood
can be seen seeping through the bandage The wound is throbbing

NIKOLAS
Doctor doctor

From the next room can be heard the doctors cold biting voice

DOCTOR
What is it

NIKOLAS
The wound is bleeding

DOCTOR
Go to sleep

Nikolas lets his arm fall into the same position as before dangling over the
arm of the chair In his semi-conscious state he hears the doctors voice
which has taken on quite a different tone he whispers seductively and
reassuringly as if trying to convince a child and overcome its resistance by
means of gentleness - or as one talks to somebody one wants to hypnotize In
his drowsy condition Nikolas hears only a few isolated words of this
monologue which in its entirety sounds something like this

DOCTOR
You are suffering you are tired come
with me we shall become one bodies
souls blood there is only one way of
escaping from your suffering and finding peace
follow me you will not be freed until
you have taken your own life come I am
waiting for you

Then everything is quiet In the silence Nikolas hears a sound drip drip
He leans forward and looks down On the floor he sees the lantern - which
Joseph was carrying when the coachman arrived apparently dead The sound of
dripping comes from somewhere near the lantern and now he sees what it
is blood running from his wound down onto his fingers and thence to the
floor where a regular pool has already formed With an expression of
bewilderment he looks towards the door into the sick-room and calls

NIKOLAS
Doctor

Again the doctor answers in an ice-cold hissing voice

DOCTOR
What is it now

NIKOLAS
(desperately)
Im losing my blood

DOCTOR
Youre losing your blood

NIKOLAS
(urgently)
Yes
DOCTOR
(slowly and emphatically)
Nonsense Its here Your blood

Nikolas sits there for a moment - uncomprehending and irresolute then he

leans forward and looks down The sound of dripping has ceased the pool of
blood and the lantern have disappeared When he lifts his hand he sees that
it is completely white and that the bandage is in order With a weary smile
he settles himself comfortably in the easy chair He both sees and does not
see the light behind the door of the sick-room moving away and disappearing

THE DRAWING-ROOM

Here the old manservant is sitting completely absorbed in the diary
Suddenly he raises his head as if he has heard a sound He starts to his
feet with an overwhelming sense of dread and foreboding He is filled with a
presentiment of some horror or other He goes to the window and sees on the
paving stones the shadow of a window on the first floor There is a light
behind the window and the light is moving He goes cautiously into the hall
When he has climbed a few steps of the staircase he can see Marc in the
window In his hand he is holding a lamp which he moves backwards and
forwards several times The manservant stands there motionless and with bated
breath

A remarkable change is taking place in Nikolas His lips open His breathing
becomes more rapid He is apparently in the throes of a sort of paroxysm as
if some strangers will is trying to gain control over him

Now Nikolas wakes with a start filled with terror depression anxiety and
despondency He looks up The manservant is standing at his side with the
glass of water that the nurse brought for him earlier when he was on the
point of fainting At the same moment he realizes what has happened it was
his own blood that spoke to him in his dream which is therefore nothing but
a horrible mirror-image of what has occurred at Léones bedside He pushes
the glass of water away and makes his way past the manservant to the sick-
room which is almost completely dark being lit only by a single small
nightlight He tears the door open

On entering he sees Marc coming from the door leading out to the stairs
When he sees Nikolas Marcs expression becomes hard and malevolent and he
increases his pace Nikolas however reaches the bed first He turns ice-
cold with horror at the sight of Léone She is lying there almost lifeless
She is whiter even than the bed-linen covering her Her face is heavy with
sleep and relaxed as if from the caress of a gentle hand The little
medicine bottle with the poison label which we recognize from earlier
scenes is held in her hand and with her last remaining strength she is
trying to raise it to her mouth At the very moment when the bottle touches
her lips Nikolas succeeds in snatching it from her He throws it into a
corner of the room where it smashes Then he hurries to Léone and uses his
handkerchief to wipe a drop of poison from her lips

Somewhere in the house a crash is heard as if somebody has slammed the main
door violently to then another crash but less violent than before The
manservant seizes Nikolas involuntarily by the arm

MANSERVANT
Stay here

And he hurries out of the room From the staircase landing he sees a light at
the foot of the stairs The light is whirling round The shadow of the
handrail flickers nervously on the wall Nikolas is seized by a new fear he
is uneasy about Giséle and hurries down The nurse who has been woken by the
noise darts into Léones room Nikolas rushes through the drawing-room into
Giséles room She is not there He listens for her breathing but not a
sound reaches him He lights a match Her bed is empty The blanket has been
thrown back He hurriedly searches the adjoining rooms which are lying in
darkness behind closed shutters and returns to the hall

From the moment he set off down the stairs a penetrating continuous howling
has been audible outside He goes to the door under which at the same moment
a white paper appears He picks it up and reads the inscription Dust thou
art unto dust thou shalt return He opens the door just quickly enough to
see the shadow of the man with the wooden leg moving off the white paving
stones of the courtyard and disappearing into the shadows of the trees
Nikolas hurries off in the same direction

LEONES ROOM

The nurse stands leaning over Léone It is evident that the patients
strength is ebbing away The nurse and the manservant are aware that
everything will soon be over Léone realizes it herself She moans sobs and
wails The nurse consoles her as best she can As for the manservant he
appears to be maturing in his mind some great project or other Léone who
has great difficulty in getting the words out says

LEONE
I am damned oh God oh my God

The manservants mouth is twitching which shows clearly that he is faced
with an important decision and he gives a deep sigh like a man who knows
that he is playing with life and death Then he calls the nurse over to the
door and says

MANSERVANT
She must not die now you must keep her
alive until morning comes

The nurse nods Then the manservant goes On the threshold he stops

MANSERVANT
God help me

He makes the sign of the cross and goes The nurse returns to Léones bed
She puts her hands up to her face presses her fingers hard against her eyes
and sobs quietly

THE WOOD
Nikolas is running in the direction of the factory

THE CASTLE

The manservant comes pushing a wheelbarrow and stops in front of a tool-shed
from which by the light of a lantern he takes a pick-axe and a shovel he
puts these in the wheelbarrow He is just about to go when he realizes that
he has forgotten something He goes back into the shed and takes a long
crowbar and a wooden mallet These objects likewise he puts in the
wheelbarrow fastens the lantern on the handle of the wheelbarrow and sets
off

A FIELD
Nikolas enters at a run and suddenly falls headlong

OUTSIDE THE CHURCHYARD
The manservant pushes his wheelbarrow along the wall He makes for the
churchyard gate

A FIELD

Nikolas is lying on the spot where he fell Suddenly his body divides in two
One part (his ego) remains lying unconscious while the other (his dream)
gets up with evident difficulty He slowly comes to and looks round in
amazement Not far off he notices an object on the ground It is Giséles
ring - the ring with the cross which her father gave her He picks it up and
examines it carefully as if Giséle has sent him a message by means of the
ring he looks round in the hope of finding a clue which direction to go in
order to find her again Then he discovers some footsteps in the sandy earth
looking as if they have just been made before his very eyes by a pair of
invisible feet - Giséles feet He gets up and follows these footsteps They
lead him to

THE BLIND WOMANS HOUSE

He goes in at the door which opens easily and finds himself in a dark yard
at the back of the house He gropes his way forward in the shadow of the
house until he finds a door without a handle He opens this in turn He now
finds himself in the old laundry room which he recognizes from his previous
visit From here he knows the way into the house and goes straight to the
door at the other end of the laundry room He enters the empty room adjoining
it Here everything is as he last saw it His own footsteps are clearly
visible in the dust on the floor nobody has been here He listens Not a
sound in the house He looks for the door into the room where the coffin
stood before It is locked So something has happened since his last visit
He tries hard to open the door but in vain

He must and shall continue From the staircase landing he discovers that the
door into the consulting-room is open The moon throws a white beam on the
stairs

Is there someone in there He steals along on tiptoe holding on to the
handrail and reaches a point from which he can see most of the room Inch by
inch his view of the room increases but there is nobody to be seen On the
other hand a large box or something of the kind is standing in the middle of
the floor It is covered by a white cloth He goes into the room The door
into the adjoining room is open It was there that he saw the coffin before -
and this must be the coffin - surely it must be the coffin under the white
cloth He goes up to it The cloth is draped over somebody lying in the open
coffin The lid is leaning up against the wall Merciful God Giséle What
has happened Has he come too late He looks again at the lid of the coffin
standing by the wall Something is painted on it in large capital letters He
reads Dust thou art unto dust thou shalt return

So these words were intended for her not for him He must make certain he
goes back to the coffin and carefully draws aside the cloth covering the
corpses face But it is not Giséle that he sees It is his own face rigid
and open-eyed his own head that rests wax-pale on the shavings in the black
coffin In bewilderment he bends over his own corpse How can this be What
can it mean Tentatively he puts out a hand in the direction of the dead face
in order to make sure but his courage fails and he pulls away his hand He
gets up and stands there motionless paralyzed petrified Cold shivers run
down his spine

en we hear a key turning in a lock and a door opening and closing Next we
ear footsteps and the sound of a stick striking the ground at intervals The
ound at once disappears down to the cellar He rushes to the staircase
anding There is the door It is a door with reinforced glass panes The
lass is murky and dusty but sufficiently transparent for him to see that
ere is somebody in the room somebody who has been dumped hands tied
ogether on a large iron bed with no bedclothes It is Giséle The door is
ocked and he is just about to look for something with which to break it open
en he hears somebody unlocking the main door Through the murky little pane
t the top of the door he can see enough to ascertain that it is Marc coming
ere is nothing for it but to return to the consulting-room and from here

He erPaeatQreoayy

he sees Marc approaching the door between him and Giséle - he is just putting
the key in the lock - when we again hear footsteps of somebody with a wooden
leg or a stick The footsteps come down the stairs Marc abandons his plan
and slips the key back in its hiding-place which is evidently unknown to the
new arrival

The man with the wooden leg comes limping down the stairs Under his arm he
is carrying a small tool box The two men meet and together make for the
consulting-room from which Nikolas has followed everything through the half-
open door Now he is obliged to retreat further He has access only to the
room where the coffin stood before

Marc and the man with the wooden leg now stand beside the coffin

Nikolas has hidden behind the door of the next room and as he stands there
he discovers an open trap-door leading down to the cellar Standing right
beside the trap-door and peeping through the crack of the door he is able to
follow what the two men are up to

Marc finds the stump of a cigar on the edge of his writing-desk He looks
questioningly at the other has he any matches The other shakes the box to
show that it is not empty Marc lights the cigar The man with the wooden leg
searches for his screwdriver Obviously it must be with the other tools in
the room where Nikolas is The man goes into this room and makes straight for
the wall opposite the door To avoid being seen as the man returns past him
N

b

ikolas descends the ladder to the cellar and when he is alone in the room
gain he is able to stick his head up and see something of what is happening
eside the coffin

There the man is engaged in putting the lid on Nikolass coffin Marc stands
there enveloped in tobacco smoke rocking backwards and forwards on his
heels He has stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat and his
watchful malevolent gaze flits rapidly across the coffin and the dead body

NIKOLAS NEW POV - FROM INSIDE THE COFFIN
The lid of the coffin has a square pane of glass just over the dead mans
face

From down in the coffin Nikolas sees the lid dropped into position over him
He hears the dull blows first of a hand then of a hammer before the lid
slips into the groove He sees alternately something of Marc and of the man
at work Both of them peer down at him Marc is in high spirits whereas the
other mans face reflects only the craftsman taking care that nothing goes
wrong

Now Nikolas hears as he lies in the coffin the lid being screwed down
hears the cutting and screeching noises of the screws as one by one they
bore into the wood It is impossible to imagine a death sentence having a
more paralyzing effect than this sound At intervals he sees through the
glass the elbow of the arm turning the screw He hears the mens footsteps on
the floor then everything is quiet Now we hear the sound of the blind
womans footsteps and her stick She is in the room standing by the coffin
One hand holds a candle over the glass the other lights it with a match and
now the blind womans bony hand grasps the light She bends her hideous face
over the glass in the gleam of the candle Her blind eyes are unable to see
the dead man but he can see her she is taking her last leave of him
Nikolas sees Marc moistening two fingers with his tongue and putting out the

light The blind womans footsteps die away from the room and now various
men can be seen coming and stationing themselves on either side of the
coffin

The coffin is to be carried through the adjoining room where at this moment
Nikolas is hiding under the trap-door To clear the way the man with the
wooden leg goes over to the trap-door With his wooden leg he kicks away the
wooden block holding the trap-door open and the trap-door closes over
Nikolas The man gives the door a push so that it comes directly over the
trap-door which in consequence cannot be opened

Through the square of glass in his coffin Nikolas sees his surroundings
change and realizes that he is being carried out Ceilings damp patches
door frames cobwebs and more door frames pass rhythmically over his field of
vision Then open sky and branches he is being carried out of the house
round the church out of the village away across the fields

Marc remains standing in the doorway He throws away the butt of his cigar
and searches in his pocket for his pipe before going back into the room
from the window of which he takes a last look at the coffin

THE FIELD
Nikolas (his ego) is lying on the ground as when we last saw him He
begins to return to consciousness The dream he has just had enters his semi-
consciousness He opens his eyes a fraction as if drowned in sleep and sees
the procession from his dream - at first making straight for him but
presently turning away He turns to watch it and discovers that he is lying
on the ground outside the churchyard The funeral procession is making for
the churchyard

Suddenly he is awake - and the dream disappears the strange procession
literally vanishes into empty air He asks himself whether the whole of this
dream may not be a message from Giséle and if so what she is trying to tell
him He gets up and goes to

THE ENTRANCE TO THE CHURCHYARD

and looks in There he sees the old manservant who is pushing away a large
flat stone from over a grave The coffin in the grave is revealed It is an
old rotten coffin The manservant now throws away his shovel and uses his
pick-axe to try and get the lid off Nikolas has caught up with him The two
men exchange meaningful nods Then Nikolas jumps down in the grave to help
the manservant

LEONES ROOM

The dying Léone wakes up with a start Her great eyes stare up at the
ceiling and her face expresses unspeakable and speechless astonishment The
nurse bends over her and asks

NURSE
What is it you can see

Léone answers almost ecstatically
LEONE

Now death is coming for me I shall not
suffer any more
THE CHURCHYARD

Nikolas and the manservant have succeeded in getting the lid off the coffin
They look with horror at the sight that meets their eyes In the coffin is
lying the old blind woman Her face is completely untouched as if she is
still alive She is preternaturally pale and sallow Neither her breathing
nor her heartbeat can be heard Nikolas looks at her by the light of the
lantern

LEONES ROOM
Léone looks like somebody waiting and listening The nurse again bends over
her and asks

NURSE
What do you hear

Léone grips the nurses hand and answers

LEONE
My father is calling for me

Her face still has the same expectant startled expression

THE CHURCHYARD

The manservant gives the crowbar to Nikolas and himself takes the mallet
Nikolas lifts the crowbar and directs the point at the blind womans heart
He raises and lowers the crowbar several times in order to take careful aim
Then he lifts it and turning his face away plunges it with all his strength
into her heart Nikolas signals to the manservant who comes up and hammers
the crowbar further and further in with the mallet They both look very
serious Blow after blow echoes around As soon as the crowbar is hammered
home the two men break off from their work and take a step back They stare
down at the grave in consternation The blind womans body has disappeared
and in the place where she lay there is now only a bare white skeleton

LEONES ROOM
Léone as before The tension and suffering seem to have gone from her face
Staring straight ahead she whispers as if in a trance

LEONE
Now I feel strong my soul is free

THE CHURCHYARD
The gravestone is being pushed back into place In this shot we see only the
coffin the gravestone and the manservants hands at work

THE BLIND WOMANS HOUSE

There is a fire in the grate Marc is lighting another cigar The man with
the wooden leg brings him a cup of coffee Marc brushes some ash from his
trousers and takes a gulp of coffee Suddenly he raises his head and looks
towards the window The man with the wooden leg observes his movements and
goes up to him They both look at the window where a face now comes into
view It is Bernard the man who was murdered at the castle earlier in the
night under such mysterious circumstances The face moves and looks in
anxiously while Bernards hands protect his eyes against the moonlight The
two men in the room are seized with terror Marc bends forward and hastily
puts out the light at the same time signaling to the man with the wooden leg
to put out the fire in the grate The latter pours water over the fire which
gives out a hissing cloud of steam

MARC
Go and see the door is properly shut

The man with the wooden leg goes leaving the door of the room open but it
bangs behind him as if blown by a draught Above the door is a large window
Marc recalls the man with the wooden leg as if regretting his order The man
turns back hurriedly but finds the door closed In surprise he steps back a
pace and through the window above the door he sees a flickering light moving
to and fro in the room In his bewilderment he remains rooted to the spot
Then he hears a sound resembling that of a mother crooning a gentle lullaby
over her child or of a doctor trying to reassure his patient during an
operation At the same time one senses beneath the ingratiating and
affectionate tone something threatening hard and almost ironic - a threat of
revenge Then we hear Marcs voice

MARC
Oh Oh Oh

On the dirty white pane the shadow of the parrot can be seen in silhouette
rocking to and fro while the silence is suddenly shattered by the parrots
mocking teasing laughter The strangely soporific monotonous voice now
begins speaking again then there is a piercing cry of terror so frightful
and horrifying that the man with the wooden leg rushes in utter panic to the
door tugs at it hammers on it and throws himself against it with all his
strength Meanwhile scream upon scream resounds each more frenzied and hair-
raising than the last

Suddenly it is as if an invisible hand seizes the man with the wooden leg and
hurls him against the wall opposite the door The light over the door moves
again The door is opened violently Marc comes out with every sign of
consternation depicted in his face A sudden gleam of light illumines the
room The parrot terrified takes to flight Marc hurries through the house
rushes out and flees without pausing for a single moment

But the man with the wooden leg lies motionless on the spot where he was
thrown to the ground His hands grip the handrail convulsively His face is
white his look bewildered and his under-jaw hangs down His eyes are open
and have a fixed vacant expression as if still seeing the fearful events of
the night

THE CHURCHYARD

The manservant has tidied up the grave and is now putting back the tombstone
on which can be read the following curious inscription Here lies Marguerite
Chopin born 4 February 1809 died 13 June 1867 Then a catalogue of her
virtues

THE BLIND WOMANS HOUSE

We see Nikolass hand inserting the key in the door guarding Giséle He finds
it behind the piece of furniture where it is hidden and inserts it in the
lock The shot is taken in such a way that the spectator is uncertain whether
the hand is real or not

ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE
Marc is running at full speed like a man pursued He keeps turning round as
if expecting to see his pursuer at every moment
THE BLIND WOMANS HOUSE

Giséle is lying on her bed leaning against the wall with her legs drawn up
under her Her hands are tied behind her back Nikolass hands appear on the
screen attempting to loosen her bonds When the knot refuses to yield he
uses his teeth Both the hands and Nikolass profile are taken as in the
previous shot ie in such a way that the spectator is uncertain whether
they are real or not

ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE
Marc is running away like a man who has lost his reason Where he is running
there is no road or path

LEONES ROOM

Léone is at the point of death She is quite calm An angelic beauty suffuses
her face She smiles Then she slowly closes her eyes She gives a deep sigh
like a child just before it falls asleep She has expired A hand lays a
little gold crucifix on her closed lips

ROLLING COUNTRYSIDE

Marc has run right across the fields still pursued by his invisible pursuer
Suddenly he is enveloped in mist It is like steam rising from the earth The
mist gives everything a ghostly appearance Marc is seized with terror He
does not know where he is He can neither see nor hear He is so confused and
agitated that he does not know which way to take He runs first in one
direction then in another tries to retrace his steps but is unable to see
them because of the mist He runs in a more and more random manner He stops
for a moment Then he sees a short distance away a light which seems to
come from a lantern and the faint outlines of a gray shadow which might be
the shadow of a man He calls but instead of answering the shadow merely
moves away from him He runs in pursuit of it but in spite of all his
exertions the distance between them remains the same Speechless with terror
he pursues his frenzied course with his hands spread out in front of him as
if trying to scatter the mist

Out of the mist there suddenly looms up a great dense shadow - the shadow of
a house which the doctor recognizes it must be the mill beside the river
The doctor decides to try and hide in the mill He will be safe there
Listening intently he opens the door and ventures in step by step He
passes the room containing the great mill-wheel which sets the rest of the
mills machinery in motion At the moment the mill-wheel is completely at
rest So the doctor continues past it on into the mills interior where the
white walls look as if they have been seared by a white-hot fire Absolute
stillness reigns everywhere The doctor arrives at the little square room
where the sacks are filled with the finely ground flour He enters the room
and peers around The ceiling of this little room consists of a sieve which
can be made to oscillate backwards and forwards and through which the newly
ground flour must pass before it can fall into the open sacks

The doctor is about to leave this room when the grated door behind him bangs
shut At the same time the mill-wheel starts turning as if set in motion by
an invisible hand The grinding rhythm of the mill-wheel is transmitted to
the many other wheels in the mill and blends with them into a dismal
monotonous drone which penetrates to the marrow and strikes the doctor as
ominous He becomes still more uneasy on realizing that the sieve above his
head is beginning to oscillate backwards and forwards shaking one load of
flour after another over him with clockwork regularity Suddenly he sees

through the sieve the shadow of the old manservant Joseph to whom he calls
holding his hand over his eyes to protect them But Joseph remains silent and
ignores the doctor who is caught in his trap In his frustration the doctor
tugs at the grated door but all in vain

The flour drifts down and down It is already up to the doctors knees and
he is almost completely out of breath He is seized with ungovernable rage
and with clenched fists he threatens the silent and invisible pursuers who
are incarcerating him in this white terror He stares straight ahead as if
hoping to penetrate the flour dusts white darkness with his gaze The flour
rises higher and higher in the cage with its many gratings and has now
reached the doctors chest He writhes and struggles desperately with his
one free hand he digs like a madman All without result The flour has
powdered his hair and eyebrows completely white He shouts - is silent fora
moment - shouts again - but nobody answers His fate is inexorable He weeps
and screams for help The flour is up to his face he closes his mouth and
presses his lips together The flour reaches his mouth His head slowly
disappears His last expression is a malevolent grimace A reflection of
light gleams in one of his glasses When it too is extinguished

THE RIVER

Cross-cutting with the scenes described above recording Marcs death are
scenes showing Nikolas and Giséle on their way down to the river When they
reach the bank they find it veiled in a white mist so thick as almost to
blot out the opposite bank A boat is lying right at their feet They jump
down in it and Nikolas seizes the oars and starts rowing When he has taken
a few pulls out into the river the mist grows thicker but he continues to
row Now they cannot even see the bank they have just left Giséle stares
anxiously around and Nikolas rests on the oars to get his bearings But they
see that they are completely enveloped in mist They are somewhat uneasy and
confused Nikolas puts his hands up to his mouth as a megaphone and calls

NIKOLAS
Hullo

No answer
Nikolas calls again and Giséle joins in

NIKOLAS AND GISELE
Hullo

Far away a mans voice can be heard answering

THE VOICE
Hullo

Nikolas stands up and shouts

NIKOLAS
Were completely lost

After a short pause he adds

NIKOLAS
Where are we
The voice from the other bank

THE VOICE
This way

NIKOLAS
Thank you

He sits down again and begins to row He rows in silence for a moment without
getting any closer to the bank Giséle is kneeling in the bow keeping a look-
out The mist is now so thick that Nikolas can only distinguish her as a dark
shadow She says

GISELE
Do you think its that way

He rests on the oars and the boat drifts with the gentle current An eddy
catches it and it starts spinning round and round Nikolas shouts

NIKOLAS
Hullo

The reply comes from a completely different direction from what he had
expected and is much further away than the first time

THE VOICE
Hullo

Nikolas and Giséle shout together Hullo

THE VOICE
This way

GISELE
Where are you

THE VOICE

(very distinctly
a word at a time)
Wait we will light a fire

NIKOLAS
Good

Nikolas stays where he is but backs water so as not to be carried further
away by the current On the bank we see the ferryman whom we recognize from
the opening of the film he is signaling to a number of small boys to collect
straw and wood for a bonfire Presently a strong flame shoots up but the
light from the fire instead of piercing the blanket of mist seems able only
to make it shine like a white wall

In the boat Nikolas and Giséle keep their eyes fixed on the place where they
think the bank must be Nikolas shouts impatiently

NIKOLAS
Hullo
FERRYMAN

Can you see there

What did you

GISELE
say

FERRYMAN

Can you see the fire

No

The ferryman stands and pond
himself to throw a bit more

GISELE
