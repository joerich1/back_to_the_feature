INT COTTAGE - DAY 14

A DEAD MAN slumped against a wall Twenties blond
hair A halo of blood and brain matter about his head

from a single bullet wound

Pages from a book stuffed into his mouth “5 12”
painted in red on the wall above his head A pot-plant
balanced on his crotch

BOYLE and MCBRIDE survey the scene A PHOTOGRAPHER
taking photos with an archaic camera the bulb popping

BOYLE
What the fuck is he doing here

MCBRIDE
He’s the scene-of-crime photographer
What do you--

BOYLE
Are you soft in the head or what
(to the PHOTOGRAPHER)
Get out of here Mick before I tell
your Mammy what you’ve been up to

PHOTOGRAPHER
Sure it’s all good clean fun
Sergeant I have what I need anyways

He pats his camera and hustles out the door just as
BOYLE shapes to give him a kick MCBRIDE looks puzzled

BOYLE
I’m worried about that lad now
He has an interest in the photographic
arts that I can only describe as

unhealthy
(examining the DEAD MAN)
He looks like Brendan Foley

MCBRIDE produces a pad and pen noting the name

MCBRIDE
You know him

BOYLE
I knew his auld fella He ran off
with my second cousin I say “ran
off” the auld fella was ina
wheelchair He was awhat-d’ya-

his mouth and studies them

MCBRIDE
AhShould you ahShould you be
removing those

BOYLE
From the Bible looks like I knew
there’d be a fucking religious angle

He tosses them aside Looks at the DEAD MAN again

BOYLE
He was a good-looking lad
Lovely lips

MCBRIDE shoots BOYLE a look
BOYLE
The significance of the pot-plant
has me somewhat perplexed

MCBRIDE
Maybe it’s genus is a clue

BOYLE
“Genus” hah Fancy

He removes the pot-plant Places his hand on the DEAD
MANs crotch and looks up at the ceiling like some
kind of weird psychic

MCBRIDE
What the hell are you doing

BOYLE

MCBRIDE is confused

BOYLE
You never interfered with a corpse
before It’s great gas

MCBRIDE
Ah now listen I don’t think--

BOYLE

fuck’s sake

He pats the DEAD MAN’s crotch Stands up Lights a
cigarette

MCBRIDE

appropriate

Barack Obama

MCBRIDE
I was only saying--

BOYLE

MCBRIDE
What No I mean I haven’t checked

(pause)
Now what the fuck would that mean

MCBRIDE
There’s a film called 8 12 Fellini

BOYLE looks blankly at him

MCBRIDE
There’s another film called Se7en

BOYLE
Are you just going to list a load
of fucking film titles with numbers
in them I can do that sure Four
for Texas Robin and the Seven Hoods
Ten Thousand Bedrooms Is that your
idea of police work hah

MCBRIDE
I was only saying

BOYLE
Well don’t say

He blows smoke rings

MCBRIDE
Maybe this is the killer’s five and
a halfhalfth victim

BOYLE
(feigning interest)
Go on

MCBRIDE
Maybe he’s killed four people before
now and he’s maimed another lad
Cut off his legs maybe Which would
be the half So this would be victim
number five and a half

BOYLE
Interesting theory So what you’re
saying is we may very well have a
serial killer on our hands

MCBRIDE
It’s a distinct possibility

BOYLE
Well that’d be a first for Galway
Won’t the big-city boys be jealous
about that when they find out

MCBRIDE
They will indeed

SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 9TH 2009 8

BOYLE
Not such a backward little town then
hah

though

OLEYUWO
What do you say to them The family

BOYLE

to be sad that’s the main thing ©

OLEYUWO
I know Pretending to be sad is what
they pay me for I always think

BOYLE
Yeah Like newsreaders
OLEYUWO
I am sorry
BOYLE

Newsreaders They always put on their
sad faces and lower their voices when
they have to announce a calamity

as if they really give a shite
They’re all jolly at the end then
as if nothing’s happened

OLEYUWO considers this He nods

OLEYUWO
I would never have made that analogy
but you are right

BOYLE

OLEYUWO
(extremely pleased)
Yes Very good

He and BOYLE move in closer to the desk and start
setting up the game

OLEYUWO
I used to play this game with my
brother all the time when we were
children He used to cheat if you
can believe this

BOYLE
He used to cheat at Downfall

OLEYUWO

So what d’ya have planned for the day

EVERETT
Well obviously we don’t know who
killed McCormick or why There was
no useful forensic evidence found
at the crime scene so I thought we
might start by canvassing the area
around where the body was discovered
See if anybody heard anything some-
thing they might have thought was
relatively insignificant but which
in light of the murder may have a
far greater importance I mean when
I caught that sonofabitch Tyrell Lee
Dobbs it was a result of something
as seemingly inconsequential as a
laundry mark if you can believe that

that was almost pathological

McCormick was probably in the process
of reconnoitring drop-off points all
along the coast Our friends Sheehy

i do not understand Just because
his car is here why does that mean
he has killed himself

BOYLE
It’s a suicide hotspot A lot of the
locals have drowned themselves here
It’s well known

GABRIELA
But Aidan was not from here
We only arrived a few days ago

BOYLE
Good point But still

They look out over the lake

GABRIELA
Why do they kill themselves

BOYLE
Ah sure why does anybody kill
themselves It’s mostly young men
The drink Depression Lack of sex
Thats the main one in my view
I bet you now if I opened a brothel
around here I‘d cut the suicide rate
in half

GABRIELA
I do not think Aidan committed
suicide

BOYLE
Neither do I to be honest with you
He didnt seem intelligent enough

GABRIELA glances at BOYLE but he is totally oblivious
to the insensitivity of the remark

BLUE REVISIONS 26 NOVEMBER 2009

BOYLE
But you never can tell Nobody knows
whos going to outlive who these days
Of course if it’s not suicide it’s
foul play

GABRIELA
Foul play

BOYLE
Murder Malice aforethought

GABRIELLA
But I cannot think of anybody who
would have wanted to do something
bad to Aidan

BOYLE
Hes a guard somebody somewhere
probably had a grudge against him
It’s a more likely theory than
suicide in my opinion Is there
anything you can tell me about him
that might have a bearing on this
Anything personal or--

GABRIELA
He is gay

BOYLE
Hah

GABRIELA

He is gay You know when one man
puts his-—

BOYLE
Im familiar with the mechanics of
it yeah I just didn’t realise

Do you think he might have met
someone here who did something bad
to him Like aWhat do you say

SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 9TH 2009 55

BOYLE
Yeah So anyways I had what I thought
was a crank call saying the person
responsible for killing McCormick was
this lad Billy Devaney Devaney’s
alibi was that he was in Hanley’s on
the night battering the head off Joey
Brennan there

EVERETT
So

BOYLE
So maybe whoever made the crank call
was in there that night saw Billy--

EVERETT
--go crazy assaulting Brennan and
decided to put him in the frame for
McCormick as well

BOYLE
Eggszactly

CLOSE on the CCTV footage -- BRENNAN rears up in front
of DEVANEY who grabs a blunderbuss from off the bar
and swings it at BRENNAN cracking him over the head

BOYLE
Jesus he gave him a hell of a clout
He’s strong for a little lad

CLOSE on the CCTV footage - BRENNAN throws a few weak
punches but DEVANEY keeps battering him with the gun

EVERETT
Whats that he’s hitting him with

BOYLE
A blunderbuss

STANTON
Yeah I know that But does it mean
theyve actually been turned into

EVERETT
No just killed

STANTON
Yeah I suppose turning someone into
liquid would be too time-consuming
hah It’d take ages

He stares off into the middle distance EVERETT looks
blankly at him

GABRIELA appears in the corridor to the lounge dressed
in a staff uniform She approaches apprehensively
EVERETT stands STANTON remains seated

GABRIELA

Was he on the take

GABRIELA
I do not understand--

STANTON
McBride Was he taking money from
people Gangsters like

GABRIELA
He was a good man Why would he--

STANTON
Ah sure were all good men
The fact remains he shows up in the
West at the exact same time a bunch
of drug-smugglers are planning to
land half a billion dollars’ worth
of cocaine and then he suddenly
goes missing Sounds fishy to me

EVERETT looks at STANTON astonished

GABRIELA
You are saying my husband is a
criminal

EVERETT
Hold on now just a minute--

STANTON
I’m saying many a blind eye’1ll be
turned for that kind of money
And he is from Dublin after all
