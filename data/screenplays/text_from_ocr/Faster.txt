CORCORAN STATE PRISON CELL DAWN
THE DRIVER pacing In silhouette

GUARDS BOOTS Walking quickly Footsteps echo

WARDEN (VO)

(East Texas drawl)
In The Prophet Kahlil Gibran
writes of good and evil “Of the
good in you I can speak but not of
the evil For what is evil but
good tortured by its own hunger and
thirst”

Look at this face

Eyes Million-mile stare

Face Shiv-fight scarred Deep divot in cheekbone Shaped

seeks food even in dark caves and

when it thirsts it drinks even of
dead waters”

BROADWAY
Guard leads Driver down broadway

Pin-drop silence as Driver passes other prisoners More like
a cathedral than prison

with yourself”

Didn’t give you a snowball’s
chance

Driver sits opposite Warden GUARD hovers behind

WARDEN
What you been through I wouldn’t
wish on any man But by golly you
survived Was like you were born
to the darkness of this place

Driver staring straight ahead

WARDEN
But I hope to God that on this day
you put that darkness behind you

Driver rack-focuses on a SPIDER outside the window
SPIDER wraps trapped FLY in silk shroud
WARDEN
I want you to know that there is

help on the outside

WARDEN (contd)
Tf things start getting to you If
you feel like you just can’t handle
the pressure Please call one of
these numbers

Warden hands Driver a card Driver considers card An ape
contemplating quantum physics Help What the fuck is that

WARDEN
To be perfectly honest I have my
doubts but I hope you luck I
truly do

committed I wonder if I would have
ever been saved It’s fragile
isn’t it the moment that sets us
on our path Our road to Damascus

Driver continues pacing The Evangelist looks at him with
compassion

Whether you kill me or notlet
this be your moment
