Naomis Room

24 June 2008
EXT CITY - DAY

A vista of ancient towers and mosques as reflected in a
gleaming modern office block

Old and new - shimmering tensely together

Crying gulls lead us across more of this exotic skyline -
east and west past and present - held together by
spectacular bridges across a vast churning river

The city of Istanbul Turkey

The setting sun seeming impaled on the spikes of the Hagia

Sophia building is a fierce circle whose edges blur and
ripple into a consuming haze

INT NAOMI’S BEDROOM - DAY

The same blood-orange light flooding into a room tipped on its
side Everything is normal except the angle and the strange
filter distorting the view It is -

A bedroom as seen by five-year-old NAOMI as she pulls a sweater
over her head sharpening her view of the room

She turns at the sound of FAINT SCRATCHING and zeros in on an
antique model house resting on a table under a distinctive
round window

The toy house is a massive edifice handcarved in the style of
Turkish Gothic with a topsy-turvy roof

She goes over and reaches deep into the front door to click
some familiar hidden switch This snaps open a panel in the
roof making the scratching louder

She scrapes forward a stool and steps onto it - her feet
craning onto tip-toes - and peers into the house

From inside a small pair of lurid RED EYES gleam back at her

They belong to a baby mouse - pink-skinned without hair
almost translucent

Naomi peers inside unblinking but friendly

From down the hall a man’s voice calls out her name but she
ignores it

NAOMI
Here Wait I got you something
She extracts some bread from her pocket and pushes small
pieces inside

MANS VOICE
Naomi Let’s go
EXT HALLWAY - DAY
It is her father CHARLES HILDERBRAND passing down the

hallway The decor is equally Turkish but Charles like the
whole family is American He raps on her door which has a

florid cutesy sign - Naomi’s Room
CHARLES
We’ve got people arriving any
minute

He moves on to the next bedroom door

CHARLES (OS) (CONT’D)
Jessica How we doing

INT JESSICA’S BEDROOM - DAY

JESSICA is Naomi’s elder sister She’s about 12 Bright and
lively pleasantly self-conscious

JESSICA
I’m ready I’m ready

She’s not ready at all
CHARLES
Sweetheart we’ve got guests

arriving any minute

JESSICA
Who I can’t hear anyone

Right on cue the doorbell SOUNDS

JESSICA (CONTD)
Alright Two minutes

CHARLES
One

JESSICA
None
INT PARENTS’ BEDROOM - DAY

Charles’s wife LAURA applies the final touches of lipstick in
the mirror - her lips a pursed ‘0’

CHARLES
That’s probably the Adivas

LAURA
What do you think

She shows him her outfit

CHARLES
You look great

LAURA
You’re not even looking

He makes a point to stop and look her over approvingly

CHARLES
Oh wait There’s something missing

LAURA
What

He grabs her and kisses her extravagantly
LAURA (CONTD)
Thank you Very helpful
INT STAIRSFRONT DOOR - DAY

As they descend the stairs to the front door it’s Laura’s
turn to have a sudden thought

LAURA
You’re not changing

Charles looks over his jacket and calculatedly loosened tie

CHARLES
What for

LAURA
Sweetie it’s a house-warming not
a ceramics lecture

She takes his half-mast tie and removes it There that’s
better
INT LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

A rattling array of plates and glasses ascends in semi-
darkness coming to a halt It turns out to be a dumb waiter

We follow the tray of glasses as a MAID collects them and
ferries them past some traditional Turkish musicians setting
up in a corner

The guests are a sophisticated cosmopolitan crowd drinking
and smoking including the people Charles will be working
with at his new job like ANDRE and his WIFE

ANDRES WIFE
I still don’t see why the college
needs to bring someone over from
America to re-catalogue its
artifacts

CHARLES
Well it’s not just a warehouse
inventory I have to authenticate
everything too

ANDRES WIFE
Ah So you get to say what’s real
and what’s not

CHARLES
That’s me

THE MUSICIANS

Are now playing background music Glasses are refilled and the
conversations are more animated

Naomi and Jessica ferry over some dishes from the dumb waiter
to the buffet table

Charles checks to see how Laura is doing and she turns to
introduce a couple in their 60s the ADIVARS

They say hello shaking hands

MRS ADIVAR
We were just saying weve lived
next door for 30 years and never
seen inside

MR ADIVAR
No one’s lived here before
CHARLES
I couldn’t believe it either As
soon as we stepped inside I knew
wed take it

LAURA
Then it turned out we already had a
connection with the place

MRS ADIVAR
How so

CHARLES
From the top bedroom I looked out
and realized I could see the park
where Laura and I first met

LAURA
He was doing his postgrad I was
doing my backpack ski tour
(making a face)
Not an auspicious beginning

CHARLES
She thought I’d never leave and I
thought she’d never come back

This does not get a laugh from Mrs Adivar

MRS ADIVAR
I couldn’t move to another country
Not with children

CHARLES
The job just came up at the right
time that’s all

He looks to Laura for agreement She nods - a united front
But Mrs Adivar still radiates disapproval Mr Adivar
deflates the tension by offering up his glass to say cheers

MR ADIVAR
So you’ve come full circle
Sagliginiza

Charles we might notice now only drinks soda water
THE MUSICIANS
Discreetly pack up replaced by a hi-fi playing up-tempo

modern music at the request of a few tipsy guests who have
started to dance

Naomi joins in as the song enters its crescendo clapped along
by some increasingly tipsy guests looking on

Jessica too cajoles her Dad into joining in They hold
hands moving round in circle Nothing fancy just having fun
as the music gets more intense and the guests more
boisterous

INT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

The aftermath Guests tumbling home “Thank you Great night
See you on Monday”

Charles heads inside to face the mess A sigh It could be
worse

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

He finds the Maid tidying up the kitchen with Laura and
Jessica’s help

CHARLES
Well the early reviews are in Two
thumbs up Particularly those
little things with the You
know

LAURA
Your new colleagues seem nice

CHARLES
Really nice

He starts to help tidy up

LAURA
You want to make sure Naomi’s
tucked in It’s our big day
tomorrow We’ve got an early start

CHARLES
I thought today was our big day

JESSICA
Why what’s tomorrow

LAURA
Christmas shopping

Charles makes a playful grab for a bottle of half-drunk wine as
he leaves

Jessica takes in her mother’s amused reaction It’s something
she hasn’t seen for a while Her parents are really happy

INT NAOMI’S ROOM - NIGHT

The scratch of pencil across paper Stick figures taking
shape Naomi draws vigorously under her tiny lamp

Charles waits holding open her bed covers
She keeps on drawing very scratchily humming busily

CHARLES
Don’t mind me

When she glances at the toy house we realize she is covering
up the sound of something She swivels noisily on her chair
but not enough to cover the unmistakable sound of SCRATCHING

Even Charles hears this

CHARLES (contd) (CONTD)
Naomi Sweetie

She casually swivels round What An unmistakable SQUEAK
sounds over her innocent features

CUT TO

THE TOY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

as Charles roots around for the mouse’s hiding place He thinks
he’s found it Presses something But it only makes the front
door snap shut

CHARLES
All right where is it

NAOMI
It’s in the secret place

CHARLES
Oh the secret place Not the
regular place
(Naomi - not playing
along)
Come on where is it

She shrugs - palms out

NAOMI
I told you it’s a secret
CHARLES
Hey You want to go shopping or
not

NAOMI

We have to go I’ve got to get
presents for my friends

CHARLES
Which friends You haven’t started
school yet

She shows him her drawings - three stick children

NAOMI
They want dolls

CHARLES
Well they’re not getting anything
until you put this friend back
outside

He scoops her into bed
CHARLES (CONTD)
First thing tomorrow That’s the
deal

He gives her a goodnight kiss and switches off the light

NAOMI
You forgot the curtains
CHARLES
No I didn’t
(yes he did)

He goes to the window pausing before he draws the curtains
shut - lost in the view for a moment

She gives a cough

NAOMI
Don’t mind me

He ‘comes to’ and leaves knocking over her little chair in
the dark She goes to complain “Hey My chair -” but he
playfully yanks the blanket over her head
INT BEDROOMBATHROOM - NIGHT

Laura finishes up in the bathroom drying her face drying her
hands

She returns to find Charles already in bed

CHARLES
How d’you feel

LAURA
About tonight

CHARLES
Tonight Settling in The big move

She gets in alongside him taking a moment to consider with
immense gravity Then gives this airy verdict

LAURA
Hmmm Simdilik her sey iyi

CHARLES
Hey Me too
(beat)
Meaning

LAURA
So far so good The girls are
already picking up bits of the
language did you hear

CHARLES
Quicker than me

They look around their new bedroom Even with its unpacked
boxes and travel cases neither one of them can quite believe
their luck

He starts to meddle with her bathrobe

CHARLES (CONTD)
You’re not changing

LAURA
This is hours of work

He chases her under the covers as she reaches for the light
Click

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

We see their house properly for the first time - in
silhouette It has a familiar shape More than familiar in
fact

It’s identical to Naomi’s massive toy house with the same
topsy-turvy roof and circular top window

Their bedroom light goes off as we dissolve nearer to the
house Up the drive to the facade rising up past -

The front door Up over the stone walls centuries old
Past the upstairs bedroom window reflecting the city lights
down below and onto the distinctive circular window of
Naomi’s room - a reflected cityscape of silhouetted towers
and mosques

The peaceful image starts to wobble and vibrate gently
seemingly shattered by -

INT KITCHEN - DAY

The CLATTER of dishes and cutlery into the sink The cheerful
chaos of the family clearing up breakfast getting ready to
depart

Laura squeezes past Charles full of lingering playful
affection as she moves things along

Jessica takes her plate to the sink as -

INT NAOMI’S ROOM - DAY

Naomi’s own hands are extracting the mouse from the toy
house

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Laura with Charles -

LAURA
You got everything

He nods

LAURA (CONTD)
Cash Phone Keys

Charles nods Yes dear

LAURA (CONTD)
I’ll just get Naomi’s stuff then
we’l1l go
She leaves and he checks his pockets Cash Phone No keys

CHARLES
Shit

Jessica looks up “appalled”

CHARLES (CONTD)
You didn’t hear that

He looks for the keys trying to be systematic about it
Jessica saves him the trouble With a little magician’s
flourish she lifts up the newspaper Ta-da They’re
underneath
INT HALLWAY - DAY
Naomi descends the stairs hands cupped over her mouse
She threads her way through the family getting ready
clearing up heading off to find coats etc - unnoticed - to
the back door
INT HALLWAY - DAY
Laura buttons up her coat just so Shouts up the stairs
LAURA

Naomi Brush your teeth Wash your

hands We’re going
EXT HOUSE - DAY

But Naomi is outside She lays the mouse on the ground
Regards it without expression

It doesn’t move She lifts the head but it flops back
uselessly

LAURA (OS)
Naomi

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Charles Jessica and Laura are all ready and waiting looking
up the stairs

LAURA
Were ready

Behind them Naomi enters from the kitchen holding out her
palms

NAOMI
All gone

EXT HOUSE - DAY

The front door opens The family emerges excitedly - Laura
helping Naomi button up her coat and fix her red mitten
Clearly this is their little ritual

She extends her hands so Laura can put on her mittens - just
so

EXT RIVER - DAY

A PROW sharply slices through water A ferry heading across
the river

INT FERRY - DAY

Naomi watches the receding shoreline intently Her red
mittens discarded and forgotten on the seat

Some other KIDS throw bread off the side provoking a huge
swooping flurry of GULLS

Naomi turns back from watching the world go by Looks
innocently up at her parents One then the other Discussing
Christmas presents

LAURA
What if Jess you come with me so
we’‘ll get Dad his present first

CHARLES
“Presents” plural surely

LAURA
Then we’ll meet back up for lunch
and switch Then you go with Dad in
the afternoon and get my present
(pointedly)
(MORE )

LAURA (CONTD)
Just the one Something simple
Nothing lavish for me

Jessica watches their banter getting more used to this new
era of good humor

CHARLES

We’‘ll meet up at 12 under the main
clock at the mall

EXT FERRY DOCKS - DAY

The ferry arrives and docks chased by crying gulls

EXT DOCK - DAY

Back on dry land Laura makes a big deal of kissing Naomi
goodbye sprucing her up
LAURA
It’s Christmas remember Make sure
Daddy gets you whatever you want
CHARLES
Not that we want to spoil you or
anything
LAURA
(big hugs)
Oh no such thing

Charles and Naomi head off crossing the tram line Jessica
and Laura wave them off Laura suddenly realizes something

LAURA (CONTD)
Wait

She holds up Naomi’s RED mittens and shouts

LAURA (CONT’D)
You forgot your mittens

NAOMI
I’m okay

She demonstrates by tucking her hands up inside her sleeves

Charles smiles - “Can’t argue with that”

EXT SPICE MARKET - DAY

The bustle of merchants and shoppers intensifies Baskets
piled high with spices of every color imaginable Rows of
food - olives dates fish

Charles and Naomi move through the growing throng making
their way on to -

EXT GRAND BAZAAR - DAY

The high arched entrance to the Grand Bazaar - gateway to
another world

Charles and Naomi move into the covered hallways - some
narrow some wide - stuffed with shops stores vendors

merchandise - rugs plates jewelry evil eye bracelets
exotic animals and of course toys

INT TOY STORE - DAY

A MERCHANT shows off his rows of dancing dolls Thanks to
their cheap crudeness they’re a little creepy up close

CHARLES
Go on knock yourself out Whatever
you want Sky’s the limit
The Merchant understands enough English to see an
opportunity He brings down his fancy dolls too - the imports
- from the top shelf

But Naomi has a very specific idea of what she wants

Her hands rove over a range of dolls down below - the cheap
ones - making very considered selections

NAOMI
I want one for each of my friends

CHARLES
As many as you like

She tugs at the limbs testing them thoroughly Quite the
connoisseur

The Merchant failing to hide his disappointment

AT THE TILL

Naomi presents her final choice

CHARLES
Youre absolutely sure Those are
the ones you want

She nods decisively

CHARLES (CONTD)
Alright you got it

He hands them over to be wrapped

INT BAZAAR - DAY

On they go through the increasingly teaming corridor Naomi
clutching her own shopping bag

CHARLES
Make sure you tell Mom I offered

They browse trinkets clothes lanterns Nothing else much
interests her though

Not until they find the shadow puppet show Karag6éz and
Hacivat - Turkey’s answer to Laurel and Hardy - battling it
out

Hacivat as always says his pal has ruined his cunning
scheme Karag6z as always replies May my transgressions
be forgiven

A crowd of mostly kids laughs at the antics behind the
illuminated screen - not quite getting the subtext of the
supporting cast the drunkard Tuzsuz Deli Bekir and his wine
bottle and the flirtatious siren Nigar

Charles stops to watch too The sounds of the bazaar get
subtly abstract as he gets drawn into the show

These expertly animated figures darting behind a lit-up
screen

NAOMI

looks up at her father His low angled profile suddenly far
away caught up in show

The hurrying flow of shoppers barely notice as she
imperceptibly wanders off into the stream of people drawn
back to a SELLER with the exotic animals

He has a basket of writhing pink mice which he feeds to his
snake enjoying the reaction it provokes from all the riveted
onlookers

Charles is oblivious - caught up in the shadow play as a
Dragon enters Its fiery red eyes swooping around behind the
screen terrifying the cowardly drunkard

Customers wipe the frame Each time Naomi is a little
further back a little smaller Each time it feels like she
is going to disappear until -

Charles turns to share Naomi’s reaction

But she’s not there Just customers passing by He looks
left then right He turns around confused but she’s -

Right next to him On his other side Repeating herself more
loudly to cut through the rising noise

NAOMI
I said Come on Dad
INT CAVAHIR MALL - DAY

The muffled quiet of a cavernous 7-floor glass and steel
atrium - the city’s largest mall

For some reason Laura and Jessica both gaze straight
upwards heads tilted right back

Actually it’s the huge clock face which covers the whole
ceiling Two massive blue hands click together for 12pm

Just as Charles and Naomi arrive Bang on time

INT MALL - DAY

The family heads to the elevator leading up to the food
court Laura trying to peek in Naomi’s bag

LAURA (OS)
So what did you get I want to hear
all about it

Charles still seems pensively affected by the puppet show
more than feels right

It’s peaceful here There’s space to gather one’s thoughts -
lots of space

It takes the ‘ping’ of the elevator doors starting to close
to snap Charles out of it

He makes a dash and sticks out a foot The doors snap back

The family squeeze on and face the front His little victory
smile to Jessica is cut short by a polite cough from behind

Charles twigs and presses the ‘Close door’ button But
nothing happens

He shifts back farther into the elevator Now the doors can
shut which prompts a long-suffering cheer from among the
passengers as -

SUDDENLY AND INEXPLICABLY

Naomi steps back out Slipping her hand free of Charles’
grip as the doors close over

- her face as she gives what looks like a little wave

The doors SNAP shut and the lift rises noisily Laura and
Charles exchange a look “What was that about” It all
happens so quickly despite the moment being stretched out
with everyone’s reactions

Charles hits the button for the next floor
CHARLES

You stay on I’1l go down and get

her
Next to him a couple of MATRONLY ladies share an indulgent
smile “Kids”
THE ELEVATOR OPENS
Charles gets out Hits the button for the other elevator
going down not exactly in the mood for playing hide and
seek
THE ORIGINAL ELEVATOR FLOOR
He returns and scans the area and its more sedate flow of
shoppers He is mildly irritated now She must be here
somewhere But the longer he looks the more his expression

changes

Laura and Jessica emerge from the elevator wondering what’s
going on Charles shrugs They fan out widening the search

Amid the unhurried traffic of affluent oblivious faces

They speed up looking everywhere But there’s still no sign
of her

Charles turns into a shocking close-up So close we can see
every detail as the first hint of panic takes over his face
EXT MALL - NIGHT

Barking shouts The RED mittens are waved under the snouts
of a pack of German Shepherds Breath steaming in the night
air

INT MALL - NIGHT

The dogs trawl the now deserted shopping floors followed by
police staff Charles Laura Jessica

Their shouts of Naomi grow faint Unanswered

We pull up and back to show the full scale of the mall - as
big and high as a city block

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Naomi’s tiny face - now we see it now we don’t It’s the
photo in Laura’s locket as he fidgets with it

She sits by the desk of a detective INSPECTOR BEY a native
in his 40s He is a breed apart from the regular detectives
more astute more diplomatic

BEY
Eye color

LAURA
Green

He types in the details for the missing person’s report

BEY
Hair color

LAURA
Light brown

BEY
Distinguishing marks

The two hands on the wall clock tick apart this time to show
it is just after midnight

Charles paces up and down next to Jessica who’s huddled on a
bench

CHARLES
You want me to get a coffee or
something Something to eat

Waiting around is agony He has to do something But she just
wants to sleep
A COUPLE OF CLEANERS

head home for the night Passing some POLICE DOGS noisily
barreling through the door

Charles turns to see But the dogs are only excited for their
dinner Jessica pulls her coat tighter exhausted

CHARLES
Why don’t I get you a blanket

He looks around for someone to ask and gradually he begins to
sense something is not quite right The dogs also seem to
sense it He scans the station as we notice it too

All the sounds are disappearing

Laura is making sure Bey gets every little detail down
Probably more than he needs but her voice trails off

LAURA
She’s really friendly but she can
be a little shy with strangers (So
they have be gentle)

A busy typist but her keys are falling silent Conversations
a gesticulating wailing drunk all gradually without sound

He pop his ears discreetly but it has no effect

Charles sees Bey excuses himself to Laura - “Hold on one
moment” - as he takes a phone call But it’s all silent

Charles moves to the drinking fountain and gulps it down
That’s all we hear - water and him swallowing

And the monstrous ticking of the clock on the wall 1203am
And the ticking of his own watch 1203 And the ticking of
the wristwatch on a PASSING MAN’s arm placed on his

shoulder as the man steps round him 1203

MAN
Excuse me

(NOTE All foreign speech is shown in square brackets but
will appear in subtitles if needed)

Instead of the man’s voice Charles hears a SQUEAK like a un-
oiled hinge and a WHOOSH and then a sickening THUD

Then just as suddenly the noise of the station rushes back
up

People prisoners are trying to get past him Normal life
Normal hearing Detective Bey at his side -

BEY
I said We’ve just got a
description that matches your
daughter They’re bringing her over
now

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT
They head excitedly out to the car park

BEY
We got a report from one of the
ferry docks She was on one of the
boats going back and forth

LAURA
Who’s she with now

DETECTIVE
The Harbor Master Actually his
wife She wouldn’t go with anyone

else

LAURA
Like I said she can be a little
shy

Charles follows with Jessica relief bursting through as a
police car pulls up

BEY
Here they come

A DRIVER and POLICEMAN get out and open the back passenger
doors

Out comes the HARBOR MASTER then his WIFE who smiles as
releases her protective arm around Naomi lost under an over-
sized hooded coat

WIFE
She fell asleep

LAURA
Oh sweetie what happened to you
Where did you get to

Naomi sleepily clings to the Woman’s waist Laura crouches
down

LAURA (CONTD)
It’s okay No one’s mad at you

The Woman soothes the child and removes the hood

A feral looking gypsy face peeps out A girl Same age Same
hair But not Naomi

Laura’s face falls

The Child can’t feel like she’s done something wrong and
blurts out something alarmed In Turkish

Disappointment quickly seizes the onlookers It’s so
palpable the Child buries her face into the Harbor Master’s
Wife bursting into tears

HARBOR MASTER
But this is the child Like I told
you -
INT POLICE CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
The family in the back seat as Bey and a driver take them
home
EXT HOUSE - NIGHT
The familiar silhouette of the house The police car pulls to
a stop They get out
INT HALLWAY - NIGHT
The front door opens The family enters followed by Bey
BEY
First things first let’s geta

photograph for the missing persons
circular

But only Laura isn’t listening She’s moving towards the
kitchen drawn by the sight of Naomi’s coat over a chair in
the back room

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

She touches it to make sure it’s real And it is

She scans the room putting two and two together and tests
the back door nearby It’s unlocked

LAURA
She came home

She hurries back to the stairs giving the coat to Bey as
proof

LAURA (CONTD)
Naomi She’s here

She starts up the stairs

LAURA (CONT’D)
Honey

Jessica follows Bey too Every one that is except Charles
who is moving into the other room
INT - LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

It is very softly lit Just a small lamp But an angle of
spilled light leads to something

Under a bureau Easily missed Just a paper shopping bag
Just like Naomi’s from the store

Charles drifts through the partition doors as everyone
disappears upstairs

LAURA (OS)
Naomi We’re home

He reaches the bureau and uses his foot to inch the bag into
view

It’s definitely the bag There are the dolls they bought

Charles already knows it’s wrong He staggers back His hands
hit the wall to steady himself as -

Laura’s voice changes when she doesn’t find Naomi in her
room

LAURA (OS) (CONTD)
Naomi

Charles’s hands explore the wall behind him and the most
awful thought hits him

He turns to face what his hands are feeling -
The dumb waiter hatch
LAURA (OS) (CONTD)
Naomi
ABSOLUTE DARKNESS

Up high a thin band of light appears It widens vertically
to show we are looking up from the bottom of a brick shaft

The thin band becomes a square of light into which Charles
pokes his head He peers down at a dark round shape in the
foreground

Charles opens the hatch wider sending in more light so we
can make out the murky shape

It is Naomi’s head face down in a puddle An elbow sticks
spastically upwards behind it

Water drops plink down rippling shadows over her face

Charles runs for help unblocking the hatch A full square of
light shines down A split-second flash of Naomi’s features

Her eyes wide open beneath the red-streaked water - serene
smiling even as -

ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Detectives forensics policemen hurrying about in the cold
dawn Laura in the throes of an awesome hysteria trying to
block -

Two CORONERS carrying the tiny white body bag to a waiting
van The body bag is locked with a padlock and a sealed form
for the morgue officials

CORONER
It’s the regulation She can’t
ride in the van

Laura grabs the van door in a frenzy not understanding
Charles barely able to restrain her Jessica lost in the
chaos

Curious shocked FACES gather to watch as grief and
frustration boil over Her howls of grief are so painful
the detectives and drivers have to look away

INT MORGUE - DAY

The airless gloom of the waiting room

The family sits fidgets paces up and down Completely in
shock and disbelief

An OFFICIAL passes outside the ribbed glass and both parents
pounce

LAURACHARLES
What’s going onWhat’s
happeningWhere’s Detective
BeyWhen can we see her

The Official looks distinctly uncomfortable as -

INT MORGUE - NIGHT

Latex gloved hands unzip a large evidence bag and remove a
strip of iron covered in blood-flecked sewage

Bey watches as the Mortician sprays off the muck to reveal
the iron strip is about 2ft long and flat like a sword

MORTICIAN
This is what you found in the
shaft

BEY

Right where she landed

Bey draws a little diagram to show the iron strip bisecting
the shaft

BEY (CONT’D)
It was like a brace between the
pulley struts

MORTICIAN
How deep was the drop

BEY
I’d say about fourteen feet

The Mortician takes his latex-covered thumb and runs it
lightly along the edge of the cleaned up iron strip A test
to see how sharp it is

The taut rubber splits open instantly

INT MORGUE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

The Mortician enters to collect Charles from the waiting-
room but only Charles

LAURA
Why can’t I see her

Bey intervenes gently but firmly

BEY
We need to talk to your husband
first

LAURA
I want to see her

BEY
And you will When we have all the
details

LAURA

Iwant to see her NOW

BEY
Mrs Hilderbrand We need you to
wait here With your daughter

He means her other daughter Jessica watching from the chair
terrified

INT MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

The Mortician leads Charles until they stop at a set of swing
doors Bey steadies Charles for the ordeal ahead

BEY
It is for you to decide if your
wife should see this

Charles steels himself Only to find he can’t take the first
step The Mortician has to ease him gently forward

MORTICIAN
Please

In they go

INT MORGUE - NIGHT

A gauzy darkness gives way as a sheet is pulled away
revealing the Mortician and Charles standing over us

The Mortician waits as Charles finally finds the strength to
look down

His daughter lies there cold stark serene Barely five
years old

The two men stand by a row of sheeted bodies All six feet
long apart from this one

MORTICIAN
Don’t be alarmed if you think you
see her move It’s quite common

We push in on Naomi’s blue-white features - Charles staring
at her face willing her to come to life

But of course she doesn’t He puts a hand to his face
seemingly finished

The Mortician lifts the sheet back but Charles suddenly grabs
the man’s wrist Makes him pull the sheet back down All the
way -

Over her shoulders

Over her torso

All the way down over her waist

Charles’s gaze follows until revulsion floods his face
Images from the day before assail him Naomi tucking her
hands up her sleeve Her red mittens Her hand slipping

free of his Her waving hand as the lift door snaps shut -

He drops the sheet and staggers back into a trolley A metal
bowl CLANGS to the floor

CHARLES
Oh my God -

He collapses and we see a flash of Naomi’s corpse Her hands
have been cut clean off

EXT STREET - DAY

A bunch of kids make their way to school under a leaden sky
A new neighborhood Modern Geometric Functional Home is
now the sixth floor of a high rise apartment block with

security cameras and a doorman

“Six Months Later”

INT KITCHEN - DAY

We find the family is at the breakfast table Just the three
places now

The decor and furniture are equally nondescript The kind of
place you move into in a hurry

LAURA
Jess

Jessica doesn’t look up from her book
LAURA (CONTD)
Jessica You hear that I’m picking
you up today About 530
This means Jessica will have to wait - again
JESSICA
Why can’t I just get the bus I’‘1l
make sure I’m with someone
LAURA
I prefer you to come home with one
of us I’m sorry I do
Jessica dumps her breakfast barely touched and heads out

Charles doesn’t agree with Laura but he doesn’t press it

Another day in the new house

INT UNIVERSITY - DAY
At least he has his work
Charles goes through various artifacts checking them off

against a list He works with his team - seen at the opening
party He is no frills but they respect

One PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN even has a bit of crush But he shies
away from her glance

INT UNIVERSITY - DAY

A MAILROOM BOY pushes a card delivering the post Some
routine bills and memos etc for Charles Also a handwritten
envelope addressed to him - with no stamp

There is something about the jagged penmanship that makes
Charles open it immediately

But instead of the usual crank letters he finds a map of

Istanbul with a cluster of red dots forming a rough circle
over one part of the city

INT CHARLES’ OFFICE - DAY

Charles waits while ANDRE his colleague from the opening
party unfolds the map and attached note

ANDRE
I thought all the crank letters and
calls had stopped

CHARLES
They had This is new New
handwriting anyway

Andre reads the note his face betraying some uneasiness

CHARLES (CONT’D)
What does it say

ANDRE
It says every dot is a children who
died suddenly “that I know of”

Charles screws it up and tosses it into the trash

EXT COLLEGE - DAY

The colleagues the old limestone building heading out for
lunch Charles declines veering away on his own

INT CAFE - DAY

A bustle of coffee-making and cigarette smoke Charles sits

in a booth at the back - a regular spot for him judging by
the way the WAITER serves him

SONIA
Professor Hilderbrand

CHARLES
Yes

He looks up to find an ELDERLY WOMAN by his table

SONIA

My name is Sonia Debelka
CHARLES

Yes
SONIA

I tell you my name because I ama
serious person

He doesn’t recognize her

SONIA (CONTD)
I have to talk to you about your

daughter
CHARLES
Wait you’re not from the press
are you
SONIA
- No -
CHARLES

Because I’ve got nothing to say

SONIA
No

There is a heavy agonized pause as she searches for the right
words

SONIA (CONTD)
I know what you are feeling

CHARLES
You can’t have any idea -

SONIA
I know because I lost a child too

She speaks so simply Charles can’t help reassessing her
The drab pathos of her coat her wrinkled haunted face

fiercely lined from a lifetime of insomniac horror The
fingernails on her gnarled hands chewed to nothing

Her hands give an involuntary movement

SONIA (CONTD)
The same way as you

INT CHARLES OFFICE - DAY

She unfolds an old newspaper story and hands it to Charles
It has a photo of a boy - her son A boy who died after
catching his hands in a threshing machine

They have repaired to the privacy of his office From her
bag she removes a large worn manila envelope

It is stuffed with yet more newspaper clippings obsessively
preserved and ordered in clumps with rubber bands She starts
laying them out covering his work surfaces

SONIA
I come to you because youre a
professor They will listen to you
Charles surveys her clippings
A child who was hit into a bus A child who drowned A child
who fell onto a set of railings A child who was
electrocuted An orphanage burned to the ground

Death after death after death

SONIA (CONT’D)
None of these are accidents

She circles a finger over her evidence
SONIA (CONT’D)
This is the work of something
inhuman -

Charles is already wondering if letting her in was a mistake

SONIA (CONT’D)
Something evil

She looks in him in the eye

SONIA (CONT’D)
The closer I get to death the more
clearly I see it I think you see
it too

CHARLES
Look I’m sorry for your loss I
am But these are random tragedies -
accidents

SONIA
This is the work of a spirit -

CHARLES
No my daughter’s death was an
accident She fell She put out her
hands to break the fall and -

Sonia CLASPS his wrists with her gnarled bitten-down hands
as if divining for some special power in him

SONIA
You found her body yes

She tightens her grip - her bony hands are eerily strong

CHARLES
So

SONIA
How did you know where to look

He can’t answer this and she knows it Her piercing eyes burn
into his

SONIA (CONT’D)
Something told you didn’t it

He pulls away but she clasps his hands tighter rattling his
coffee cup spilling it

SONIA (CONTD)
Something you can’t explain

Her strength is alarming

SONIA (CONTD)
These are not accidents Your
daughter’s death was not an
accident -

He pulls free emphatically - more violently perhaps than he
intended - scattering her papers everywhere knocking over a
chair

SONIA (CONTD)
This is a cursed place You have to
know that

CHARLES
(heading out)
Alright that’s it I’m getting
security
She looks lost and panicked - helpless She was so sure hed
understand
INT UNIVERSITY HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
A SECURITY GUARD accompanies Charles back to his office
CHARLES
Let’s sort this out without making

a scene

But when they get to his office There is no sign of Sonia
Just a tell-tale fire exit door left ajar

And the flurry of hastily dropped clippings - death after
death after death
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

The pulsing red digits of the bedside clock Charles lies in
bed unable to sleep Laura curled up away from him

When he catches himself absently rubbing the inside of his
wrists - where Sonia gripped him - he realizes sleep is out
of the question

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

He gets a bottle of water from the fridge throwing light
over the photos of Naomi watching from the far wall

He gulps it down surprised at how dehydrated he is

As he drinks a strange light suddenly refracts and flickers
through the glass

He twists the bottle trying to recreate the effect

Is it coming from the outside He switches off the light so
he can see out the window

All is dark Just the distant view of the city bridge

Until in the distance a pair of headlights comes over the
hill

As they dip and reappear then swing round a bend and send a
wash of reflected light across the ceiling which reflects
off the dangling pots and pans and in turn hits the bottle in
his hand

A quick but definite flicker of refracted light

Satisfied he switches the room light back on and finds -

A TURKISH GIRL

Right in front of him

CHARLES
Jesus Chr-

This spectral face staring right at him lifeless blue-
white As stark and solid as day

The bottle smashes on the tiled floor A wash of shards
spreading around his bare feet

When he looks back the Girl is already halfway out the door

CHARLES (CONTD)
Wait

Charles moves after her but glass shards plunge into his
bare feet forcing him to pull up in agony

By the time he gets to the hall it’s empty and silent No
sign of anything unusual except the blood he is smearing on
the floor

INT KITCHEN - DAY
Sunlight and silence And Jessica picking at her breakfast
Laura enters pausing over the blood stains on the floor Two

dark red spots like a pair of eyes

And the scattering of glass pieces hastily swept to one
side

JESSICA
I didn’t do it
INT CAR - DAY
A leafy street Charles sits in his parked car deep in

thought watching something across the road It is we now
see their old house

On the passenger seat next to him are Sonia’s mass of
clippings gathered together in their tattered envelopes

He has kept one unfolded the girl who suffocated in an
abandoned refrigerator

Up close she looks eerily similar to the one he saw the
previous night

EXT STREET - DAY

The old house is now all lit up A police car turns into the
driveway and pulls to a stop

As the sound filters up it becomes clear Charles is thinking
back to the night Naomi died

STATION MASTER (VO)
She wouldn’t speak to me I think
my uniform scared her

LAURA (VO)
She can be a little shy with
strangers sometimes

STATION MASTER (VO)
That’s why I got my wife to come
take her home

Charles watches the Patrol Man knock on his old front door
accompanied by the Station Master’s Wife and the small
hooded Girl

The door opens and a glare of light leads him into -

INT OLD HOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

His own flashback Charles once again finds his way to
Naomi’s shopping bag under the bureau in the living-room

LAURA (OS)
Oh sweetie what happened to you
Where did you get to It’s
okay No one’s mad at you

He leans against the wall knowing what he’s seeing in the
other room is all wrong

STATION MASTER (OS)
But this is the child The one I
found Like I told you -

Charles looks round to see what his hands were feeling We
are much closer this time so we see every thought cross his
face as something tells him to open the hatch

SONIA (VO)
So how did you know where to look

He recalls hearing the SQUEAKING hinge at the police station
And the time on the three clocks 217 217 217 The
time of her death

And then he’s back in the living-room on the fateful night

making the same noise as he opens the SQUEAKING hatch and
peers in somehow knowing to expect the worse

EXT STREET - DAY

Back in the present his old house sits in thin sunlight
Deserted Locked up

SONIA (VO)
Something told you didn’t it

Charles starts the car and drives off chased by her words -
SONIA (VO) (CONTD)

Something you can’t explain
INT DEN - NIGHT
Items are pulled out one by one - toys clothes books
Charles is going through a chest of Naomi’s lovingly kept
things Half in remembrance half in the hope of finding a
clue
He looks over the sign to Naomi’s old bedroom He flicks
through her drawing book Unremarkable pages of stick men and

flowers Then blank pages

Charles gets to the last drawing Naomi did But it’s a
meaningless mess of squiggles roughly forming a circle

JESSICA

Has noticed him from the hall She watches quietly The
perfect sister she’ll never replace

He moves onto Naomi’s clothes The pockets of the coat she
wore on her last day but they’re all empty And of course
her red mittens

The only thing left is the brown shopping bag The three doll
she bought still in their wrapping

His mind flashes back to Naomi testing their limbs at the
bazaar

Charles opens her book again and finds her stick figure
drawings The one of Naomi with her “three friends”

He studies it more closely This time he notices none of
them has any hands Feet - but no hands

LAURA (VO)
Honey
INT DEN - MORNING
Laura’s blurred shape hovers over us in the early light

LAURA
Honey

He blinks awake in his chair as she opens the curtains He
has spent the night in a chair with a blanket watching the
spot where the girl appeared the night before

But everything is normal Nobody came The girl did not
return

LAURA (CONTD)
What are you doing

How can he begin to explain honestly

CHARLES
I couldn’t sleep

LAURA
I thought we were going to go over
vacation ideas

She puts down a couple of ski resort brochures
CHARLES
I’m sorry I got caught up with

work

She notices the trunk of Naomi’s stuff still open “That’s
work”

She puts Naomi’s things back in the trunk - just so - and
shuts the lid

LAURA
Come on We’re supposed to be
moving forwards

INT CAR - MOVING - DAY

The noisy ill-tempered crawl of Istanbul’s daily gridlock
Charles’ distant profile preoccupied with his own thoughts
as he drives Jessica to school

Up ahead two red traffic lights glare harshly in the stark
morning shadow

INT AMERICAN SCHOOL - DAY

They turn into the school driveway which circles around a
large tree and stop A swam of smartly dressed children
converge on the entrance To Charles everyone of them is a
potential ghost now

Jessica stares at her feet unable or unwilling to move He
is so distracted he doesn’t notice Finally -

JESSICA
I miss her too you know

It takes Charles a moment to process the intensity of what
she’s feeling Too long really

JESSICA (CONTD)
You know Naomi and me had a secret
plan for when you and Mom didn’t
get on We used to walk in front of
you and hold hands We figured
youd see us and want to be close
too

She desperately wants some reassurance from him but his own
emotions are in freefall too

Outside this babble of children Inside the heavy silence
of clogged grief

All he can see are these children closing in on him - getting
louder and more unsettling Giving him strange glances
Demanding his attention Especially one GIRL who comes right
up close to the window -

GIRL
You’re not looking You’re not
looking

She turns to show off her handiwork A pair of scissors
plunged into her neck Just like the story in one of Sonia’s
clippings

Spurting blood all over the windscreen

INT BAR - DAY

A dark smoke-laced bar Charles enters and sits on a bar
stool avoiding his reflection in the mirror

The BARMAN automatically places a glass of beer in front of
him

Charles looks around the murky room Nobody here knows his
history Nobody knows to stop him

So suddenly the glass is half empty and his day is bearable

A bottle of spirits is ferried over to a table of guys well
on the way to boisterous oblivion

Charles watches them forgetting their troubles happily If
they can do it why can’t he

He gulps his drink and slams the glass down A circle that
turns into -

EXT STREET - DAY

A bottle cap being spun loose Charles is in his car
clutching a bottle of spirits wrapped in brown paper He
takes a HUGE swig

He is about to swallow when he catches his face in the
rearview mirror

He turns away and shuts his eye but it doesn’t help He sits
there mouth full a man teetering on the precipice

Until finally finally he spits it out the window It looks
plain uncouth to a passer-by Charles doesn’t even notice
All he knows is that he has to get help and fast

His heart is thumping Sweat dots his brow He starts up the
car and pulls away

INT CAR MOVING - DAY

The open bottle he realizes is still in his hand It’s as
if someone else put it there

He spots a trash can on the opposite side goes to turn but
can’t The light is red He waits His indicator clicking
Telling himself to stay calm

The light goes green He swings a U-turn and heads back to
the trash car when out of nowhere -

A RED-HAIRED GIRL

runs RIGHT into his path He slams on the brakes but it’s
hopeless

He hits her full on SLAMMING her out of sight and under the
car

The sickening THUD of impact The terrible double-jolt of
instant death under the wheels
EXT STREET - DAY

The car SCREECHES to a halt with the WRENCHING of metal as
his side-view mirror is RIPPED off against a parked car

The bottle flies loose SMASHING against the side window - an
explosion of glass and booze
INT CAR - DAY

Fat red droplets slowly come into focus - dripping from the
steering wheel

Charles’ knuckles slowly release the wheel and wipe his dazed
face flecked with blood and booze

His hearing is muffled - distant shouts hurrying footsteps
Murderously harsh sunlight hurting his eyes

He slowly remembers there was a girl involved
CHARLES
Oh God no
EXT STREET - DAY
He gets out and runs back to the point of collision

But the body is not there Not under the car Not even
between the nearby parked cars

Onlookers inch closer baffled by his actions as he looks
around

Didn’t anyone see the child

CHARLES
You didn’t see that

See what The dog A dog is YELPING running free with no
owner in sight

The OWNER of the car that Charles hit inspects the damage -
his sense of violation building as he smells the booze

OWNER
Hey

Charles runs past him back to his own car and checks the
front grille

There are no dents on the front bumper no scratches
nothing Just a telltale reflection of a building above him

Charles stares up at the unmistakable icon of the Galatea
Tower - just like in the clipping

OWNER (CONTD)
I said Hey

ON-LOOKER
You want us to call 112

The irate Owner sees the bottle label amid the blood and
shattered glass

OWNER

Screw the ambulance You call the

police
INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Laura makes her way to a reception desk
Steeling herself for what she will find And for what she
will have to say
EXT HOSPITAL CARPARK - NIGHT

They walk to her car Charles is bandaged up - his cuts all
treated

They get in but she doesn’t start the engine just yet

INT CAR - NIGHT
She has something to clear up first

LAURA
The police said you swerved to
avoid a dog

It’s the official story now so he doesn’t disagree

LAURA (CONT’D)
They also said they had to
breathalyze you

CHARLES
It’s standard procedure

LAURA
Only if you’ve been in a bar

She looks across at him trying to contain her feelings

CHARLES
I wasn’t drunk I’d had one beer
One

The windows have begun to mist up shutting out the rest of
the world Just their breathing and the rustle of their
overcoats

CHARLES (CONTD)
Today was the first time I swear

it

LAURA
They said the car was drenched in
alcohol

CHARLES

I bought a bottle of spirits But I
was looking for a trash can to dump
it I did a U-turn I skidded It
smashed all over me

It sounds ridiculous

LAURA
Don’t make me drag this out of you

CHARLES
I took a swig I admit it It was
in my mouth But I didn’t do it I
spit it out

There He said it The truth

He looks her in the eye facing up to the depth of her sense
of betrayal

INT JESSICA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jessica gets into bed

JESSICA
Is he okay

LAURA
He’s fine It was just a dent

Jessica knows not to push it Laura says goodnight Closes
her bedroom door

Jessica sits it her bed Feeling lonely

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Laura finds Charles at the table fully expecting her next
announcement

LAURA
You know the agreement

He certainly does

LAURA (CONT’D)
We said if you ever slipped you’d
have 24 hours to get help or -

She steels herself to do something she’s never done before -
give him an ultimatum

LAURA (CONTD)
You’d have to leave

He holds up a business card for a psychiatrist Dr Ayshe

CHARLES
I already got a number from the
hospital

But it’s not enough to quell her anger

LAURA
I don’t understand You know you
can’t drink

(MORE )

LAURA (CONTD)
You know what it cost us before
You know it doesn’t solve anything

She’s unable to contain her anger
LAURA (CONTD)
What makes your day so much harder

than mine

She looks him in the eye She genuinely wants to know But
how can he begin to tell her without sounding insane

INT CHARLES’ DEN - NIGHT

He quietly shuts the door and uncovers Sonia’s newspaper
clippings

Specifically the story of the girl who fell from the town
tower A photo of the Galatea Tower is marked with the girl’s
fall

Charles unfolds the clipping to find the girl’s photograph
He angles his desk lamp for a clearer look There is no doubt
about it this time

She is identical to the girl Charles hit

INT PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

A worldly woman in her 50s studies pages of notes This is
DR AYSHE the name on Charles’s business card

Charles sits opposite a little like a defendant awaiting a
jurys verdict on his testimony Sonia’s bag and its contents
are even laid out like exhibit A

Finally just when he starts to look around -
DR AYSHE

How many of these strange children
have you seen altogether

CHARLES

Two That I’m sure of
DR AYSHE

And the premonitions
CHARLES

One The time in the police

station
(MORE)

CHARLES (CONTD)
But I hear other things a lot
strange noises ambient echoes that
don’t make sense

DR AYSHE
Not yet anyway

She lifts her head gives him a look It is impossible to
tell if she is joking

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
And you think your experiences are
connected with whatever ‘force’ is
causing all these deaths

She indicates the array of clippings he has laid out for her

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
“Lamia”

CHARLES
I’m not saying I believe it I look
at it logically and I know it’s
completely crazy

He rubs his face his eyes hollowed out from lack of sleep

CHARLES (CONT’D)
But trying to ignore it feels more
crazy

Dr Ayshe squeezes some lemon in a glass of tea He might as
well be talking about the flu

DR AYSHE
Well for the logical mind
supernatural experiences can be
very challenging If you’re wrong
you’re crazy And if you’re right
youre doomed

She resumes looking over her notes

CHARLES
(not wanting to press the
issue or anything -)
So which one am I

DR AYSHE
Neither

She takes a suck on her lemon without even a wince Charles
looks at her like she’s the crazy one an irony which she is
not averse to enjoying
DR AYSHE (CONTD)
What you’re experiencing is a
perfectly natural stage of grief
What we call the Affective Phase

She puts aside her notes now this is all textbook

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
When the pain of losing a loved one
becomes too great people often
suppress their feelings In the
case of a sudden seemingly
senseless death even more so In
place of their grief these people
create a new world for themselves
They can do it with drink or drugs
They can regress into childhood
fantasies or obsessive behavior
Or -

She gestures to show this means Charles

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
They can construct a parallel
universe with its own rules A new
world that is able to make sense of
their tragedy - like a supernatural

one
Charles
I didn’t construct this woman Sonia
Debelka
DR AYSHE
No -
CHARLES

And I didn’t construct these
children These deaths are all
documented -

DR AYSHE
As you’ve shown me but your
subconscious is ingeniously fusing
them together to supply the meaning
you need

She pauses
DR AYSHE (CONTD)

None of these children you see are
boys All of them are girls

stuff

She finds that very revealing Does Charles She flips back a
page to check a detail

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
This woman who contacted you -
“Sonia Debelka” What did she do
apart from read about Naomi in the

paper

CHARLES
She lost a child with identical
wounds

DR AYSHE

So this is a woman who has spent
her entire adult life collecting
local newspaper clippings searching
for her own explanation That’s -
what - 50 years spent looking for
someone who matches up until she
finds you I call that an
acceptable coincidence

CHARLES
But how could she know I would see
these children

DR AYSHE
You only saw these apparitions
after she’d told you about them

CHARLES
But the girl I hit in the road -
she was identical to the one in the
newspaper

DR AYSHE
Which you had already seen

He leaps from his chair and leans his forehead against the
cool glass of the window staring out over the city

CHARLES
Then why does it feel so real

She waits until he turns round before replying

DR AYSHE
Because you want it to

INT DR AYSHES OFFICE - DAY

Charles leaves her office clutching the box of clippings
That was not what he wanted to hear

DR AYSHE (VO)
The more terrifying you can make

the world the bigger excuse you
give yourself to drink

INT CAR - DAY

He throws Sonia’s envelope onto the front seat spilling the
contents slamming his dented door

He is tired indignant frustrated

And now he will be humiliated

A piece of paper is peeping from the inside of Sonia’s
envelope It is a brighter shade of white because it is not a
clipping but a prescription

He unfolds it and reads the patient’s name

“Sonia Debelka”

And her dosage

“Pedakin Reskalith-HF 900mg Effexin 20mg ”

INT PHARMACY - DAY
A white-coated DRUGGIST looks over the prescription

DRUGGIST
Reskalith is a brand of lithium
orotate It’s a mix of
anticonvulsants and emotional
stabilizers

CHARLES
Like an anti-depressant

To put it mildly

DRUGGIST
At these dosages it’s more likely
to be used to treat a severe mental
disorder Something like acute
bipolar or schizo-affective
syndrome

CHARLES
In other words you mean someone
who’s crazy
It is not the terminology he would use but the Druggist
shrugs Yes

EXT PARK - DAY

Charles walks slowly back to the office Overtaken by a group
of CHILDREN on some school trip

Happy normal children swarming around him No ghosts no
stark white faces no howls of agony The way the world is
supposed to be One KID smiles at him

Two more are even marching in front of him holding hands

Charles can’t help it He feels like a fool

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Charles feeds all the papers and clippings - all his mania -
into an incinerator Pouring on lighter fluid Setting it
alight

He makes sure everything get consumed by the flames even
Sonia’s bag Sparks crackle and pop forcing him to step
back

The roaring flames have a soothing almost hypnotic effect on
him Long after the last clipping has curled to nothing his
eyes are transfixed by the flames

His gaze pushing deeper into the ROARING fire as it dissolves
to -

EXT SKI RESORT - DAY

Pure white snow

Jessica Laura and Charles take a ski-lift up to the top -
the family’s long planned vacation

It’s a world away from the city - clear blue sky stretching
out across mountains - above it all

EXT SLOPE - DAY

Jessica snaps in her skis and sets off down the slope with
real abandon Chased by Laura - whooping with joy It’s like
they’ve never seen the snow before

Charles follows - a little more tentatively but only at
first

He skis faster and faster the wind pummelling his face It’s
a huge release for all of them
EXT WINTER RESORT - DAY

It’s a sleepy unhurried place The complete opposite of the
Bazaar

Charles ambles through with Jessica browsing for some
souvenir She hangs on his arm a bit and he likes it

EXT SKI RESORT CONDO - NIGHT

The remains of dinner They’re sitting together noisily
playing a card game - Cheat - complete with outraged displays

of wounded innocence and blatant bluffing

This is Charles coming alive again and back to his best -
playful deadpan super charming

Laura catches herself glancing at him It’s like falling in
love again
INT SKI RESORT CONDO BEDROOM - NIGHT

Laura - hair wet in a bath robe - brushes her teeth wiping
the away the steam to see herself

Charles emerges from the shower towelling down A half-look
as they prepare for bed

She rinses her mouth All done Gives him a proper look this
time

Well

INT SKI RESORT CONDO BATHROOM - NIGHT
She pulls him towards the bed not letting him even dry off

There’s something very hungry about it intensely needy

The towel and bathrobe only get in the way as they fall onto
the bed this huge eruption of repressed emotion

Her cheeks and throat are flushed as she pulls him close The
kissing is exciting Raw

But suddenly it’s too fast or too aggressive - for him
He’s trying to slow it down or worse stop it completely In
the intimate emotional eco-system of marriage she

immediately detects something’s off

She tries to continue - pushing him back taking more
control

But it’s no use It’s all wrong

INT BATHROOM - DAWN

Charles gulps down some bottled water What the fuck is the
matter with him

It’s like his throat is sandpaper And his forehead is
burning up
EXT SKI RESORT - DAY

Jessica waits for the chair lift yakking with some kids
mostly boys who like her

Laura watches from the terrace over breakfast It’s nice to
see this Jessica attracting attention encouraging even

She takes Charles’s hand sitting next to her somewhat
distant wanting to share her parental pride At least
they’ve got one thing right

CONCIERGE
Mr Hilderbrand phone for you

A CONCIERGE hovers into view with a phone Charles thinks
this is a mistake until -

CONCIERGE (CONTD)
A Detective Bey

Charles takes the phone

CHARLES
Yes

INT SKI RESORT CONDO- DAY

Charles closes his suitcase Gives Jessica a goodbye kiss
Clearly he is returning early

LAURA
If it’s so urgent they can at
least explain why

CHARLES
Whatever it is I‘’ll be right back

He kisses her goodbye at the door She holds on to him
wanting him to stay But in a strange way it’s a relief for
Charles to leave -

The jollity of the resort the harsh bright glare of the
snow It’s like he’s no longer comfortable in his own skin

As he goes we register the impact on Jessica

INT CEMETERY - DAY

A forest of crumbling headstones Charles is led by a
POLICEMAN past once lavish stone tombs now ruined and
strangled in dead ivy and misshapen fungi

Waiting up ahead is Detective Bey He doesn’t wave

BEY
You are friends with a woman called
Sonia Debelka

CHARLES

BEY
Well she knows you She has your
name and address

He is holding a see-through evidence bag A mad mess of torn-
out reference pages and scribbled notes

CHARLES
I met her once She came to my
office a few weeks ago

BEY
Any particular reason

CHARLES

Shed read about my daughters’s
death in the papers and decided we
had a kinship

(for want of a better

phrase)
She lost a child in similar
circumstances

How can he explain it further without sounding insane

BEY
So she wasnt a close acquaintance

CHARLES
No I met her once

This makes Beys next job a lot easier He gestures to a hive
of police activity up ahead “In that case see for
yourself”

BEY
We found her body early this
morning

They get closer and see the familiar white of a body bag It
lies on the ground still unzipped having its tag filled out
by a CORONER

Charles gets closer and sees Sonias petrified face -
bizarrely spotted with burn marks

BEY (CONT’D)
This is her the woman you met

Charles gets out a nod as he takes in the spattered blisters
on her clothes and skin

CHARLES
Christ What happened

BEY
Heart attack most likely

CHARLES
What was she doing

Isn’t it obvious

BEY
Digging

He indicates the Coroner can now zip up the bodybag

CHARLES
But the burn marks

BEY
Some kind of acetic acid She was
probably performing some kind of
purification ceremony when she
had a seizure She probably dropped
and smashed the jug of acid here

He leads Charles to the front of the grave and motions how it
would have splashed over her front

CHARLES
She was going to pour acid into the
grave

BEY

Not the grave exactly Cehennem
gegidi A “gateway” And not just
pour it Set it alight

They step aside as an oversized box of matches soggy from
the wet grass is bagged and taken away

BEY (CONTD)
It’s local folklore A gateway is a
hole that releases an evil spirit
If you find the hole you can burn
it “clean”

He shakes his head at the idiocy of it all

CHARLES
Did she
(trying to sound equally
dismissive)
Find a gateway

BEY
Of course not Bunlarin hepsi
sagmalik
(realizing Charles’
Turkish isn’t that good)
“It’s allnonsense Gibberish”

For further proof they two of them ponder the headstone all
in Ottoman Turkish dating back centuries

The stone is covered in moss except one part which - judging
by the scraper and moss remnants - Sonia must have scraped
clean to reveal some kind of engraved circular motif

Bey puts a hand on Charles’ shoulder mistaking his stillness
for bewilderment and confides an amusing little secret

BEY (CONT’D)
The good thing is she was an
escaped asylum inmate so no one
expects it to make any sense

Charles plays along “reassured” allowing Bey to barrel off
and shout at his team to wrap things up

But Charles is riveted by the engraved circular symbol He
moves closer so we can see it is -

Two SNAKES devouring each other

He doesn’t know what it means but there is something
naggingly familiar about it

INT LIBRARY - DAY

An ancient leather bound book opens up releasing a swirl of
dust motes

With no little effort Charles has tracked down a number of
reference books with examples of the same circular image from
the grave

Two snakes devouring each other’s tail Old ink drawings
etchings stone engravings

PROFESSOR (VO)
It’s the symbol of Lamia

INT COLLEGE - DAY

An owlish PROFESSOR enthusiastically shares his learning as
he looks at copies of the images

PROFESSOR
Vengeful child-killing spirit from
Byzantine mythology She could move
on the wind Drive people insane
Erupt from the earth unleashing
fire There’s lots of variations
but always associated with
murdering innocent children

He bends over with a magnifying glass

PROFESSOR (CONTD)
The variant on the snake motif is
fascinating One snake in a circle
is the ouroboros obviously - a
symbol of rebirth and renewal But
two snakes complete reverses the
meaning Suddenly it becomes good
and evil locked in a doomed
struggle of mutual destruction

He sighs in admiration Offers the glass for Charles to see
for himself

CHARLES
Any reason why it would be engraved
on a head stone

PROFESSOR
If it was a child’s headstone from
the Byzantine Empire - absolutely
So-called burning fever was known
as Lamia’s Disease

He excitedly gets to work digging up some old leather
volumes to share

PROFESSOR (CONTD)
She’s a minor figure in many ways
strictly indigenous but very
industrious and spectacularly
heartless

INT LIBRARY - LATER

Charles pours over the scattered references to Lamia’s
handiwork in the Professor’s library

Hours and pages of horrifying images have left him somewhat
numb But something makes him go taut with interest

It is a drawing of a burlap sack seemingly fished out from a
river being emptied upside-down by a farmer

It’s a stylized recreation of a startling moment - a dog
yelps at the farmer while onlookers are grouped around wide-
eyed

But no one looks more intently than Charles - his face frozen
in the gathering gloom

For tumbling out of the sack are half-a-dozen amputated
hands

EXT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Wisps of smoke blow across the street quiet and empty apart
from a NEIGHBOR burning leaves

A cab pulls up discharging Jessica and Laura back from
vacation They have weather tans It’s been a few days

The Security Guard comes to help with the luggage His
jollity evaporates when he sees Laura and Jessica’s
expressions

They look up and eye the tower block warily uncertain of
what they will find inside

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Charles is nowhere to be seen They put down their bags
Notice the kitchen hasn’t been cleared for a couple of days

LAURA
You go unpack I’1ll sort out
dinner

Jessica heads to her room Laura moves the other way to
Charless home office

INT DEN - NIGHT

Charles sits facing the door in the evening gloom his knee
bouncing up and down He has a book in his hand Like he’s
been waiting for her

LAURA
What happened to you You missed
everything

She switches on the light and sees the room is covered with a
mess of strange books on every surface print-outs old
files ledgers - strange inky drawings of gateways effigies
serpents

His features are haggard and drawn from lack of sleep
Unshaven too

CHARLES
The night Naomi died I had a
premonition At the police station
This feeling that something made
her do it

Okay

CHARLES (CONTD)
It wasn’t a dog I ran over It was
a girl Who’d fallen from the
Galatea Tower ten years ago I see
these children everywhere All the
time

He sees her subtly looking around the room Is that a jug of
acid

CHARLES (CONTD)
I haven’t been drinking

Somehow that doesn’t make it better

LAURA
Shouldnt you talked to Dr Ayshe
about this

CHARLES
I already have She thinks I’m just
trying to create an excuse to drink
again

That doesn’t seem so far off the mark to Laura

CHARLES (CONT’D)
Okay Read this

He gives her the book Indicates the spot

LAURA
“Lamia”
(he nods)
“Implacable child-murdering daemon
of Byzantine mythology whose
vengeful spirit scoured the land
driving children to their deaths”

CHARLES
Now look at her symbol

LAURA
Charles What does this have to do
with anything

CHARLES
Will you just look at it Please

He indicates the old ink drawing of two snakes in a circle
devouring each other’s tail
CHARLES (CONTD)

This was on the grave at the
cemetery where the old woman died
Sonia She came to me a few weeks
ago She’d lost a child too Just
like Naomi

(indicating his hands)
She was trying to tell me all this
But she didn’t have all the pieces

Charles retrieves another book

CHARLES (CONTD)
Look -

Shows her the drawing of the sack of amputated hands

CHARLES (CONTD)

This sack was pulled out of the
Bosphorus It had six severed hands
in it - childrens hands

(reading)
“When the bodies were never
found many competing myths and
legends sprang up to explain the
mystery - ”

He skips through all those myths to the relevant one

CHARLES (CONTD)
“One version even said the children
were killed by their own father
that he was possessed by Lamia
while building a home on top of the
gateway to her burial place”

LAURA
What does this have to do with our
daughter
He gets Naomi’s drawing book
CHARLES
Look at the children There’s three
of them right
So what

CHARLES (CONTD)
Now look at the hands

Or rather the absence of any hands

LAURA
Charles These are stick figures

CHARLES
Not these

He has the three dolls Naomi tested at the Bazaar - all their
hands wrenched loose “just to make sure”

CHARLES (CONTD)
And look at this

He flips through Naomi’s drawing book

CHARLES (CONT’D)
This is the last drawing she did

It is the rough circle with a V-shape at the top and at the
bottom like two rough arrows

Charles has made a tracing of the drawing which he lays over
the ink drawing of Lamia symbol

The two V-shapes on the top and bottom of Naomi’s weird
circle now make sense - they pretty much match up with the
two snakes’ heads

CHARLES (CONTD)
I think that gateway is under our
old house I think that’s where
those three children were buried I
think Naomi saw them I think she
was driven to jump by this spirit -

LAURA
She didn’t jump She fell -

CHARLES
Just like all these other kids that
have died here -

LAURA
Five-year-old girls don’t commit
suicide

CHARLES
That’s my point Something made her
do it

He taps the drawing of the two snakes “This”

LAURA
You can’t believe this

But he does

INT JESSICA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jessica reacts to the sound of her parents’ voices spilling
into the hallway

LAURA (OS)
This is insane You’re insane
INT FRONT DOOR - DAY

She is trying to stop him as he rummages for his carkeys and
jacket

CHARLES (OS)
No It’s all connected You’1l see

LAURA
What are you going to do Break
into our old house and start
digging up the basement

Actually that’s precisely what he’s going to do

INT OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

The SPLINTERING of wood as Charles jimmies open a window and
Charles drops into the dusty basement

He ascends into the empty house his old home plastic sheets
crackling underfoot The place is undergoing many changes
after months of no-one wanting to rent it

New coats of paint sheets draped over the floor and
banisters A renovation halfway through

INT GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

He picks up a hammer from among the workmen’s tools looking
for some kind of clue

Testing the floorboards the wooden panelling Checking the
back of closets

He passes one wall that’s being knocked through

He passes another one that’s being bricked up - the dumb
waiter shaft The scene of the original horror

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

He descends to the basement and its stone floors TAPPING the
walls and the floors hoping in vain for a hollow sound
Looking behind the big old furnace

Finally his gaze settles on a sheet covered item It’s the
antique toy house put down here for safe keeping

But it’s not the house that interests him It’s what behind

He drags the house aside to reveal the lower dumb waiter
entrance as yet unbricked up

He opens it up with a recognizable SQUEAK

INT JESSICA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Laura knocks and looks in on Jessica who’s hunched over
writing at her desk

LAURA
You okay You want some dinner

Jessica barely shakes her head

LAURA (CONTD)
You’ve got to have something

She stays hunched over her desk SCRATCHILY drawing just like
Naomi at the beginning But Laura doesn’t know to make
anything of it

INT DUMB WAITER SHAFT - NIGHT

A WORK LANTERN

flares into life as Charles clambers through and lights up -
THE DUMB WAITER SHAFT

Damp brick walls leaving barely any room to turn Just the
sound of his breathing and some echoed memories from the

fateful night

On each side of the shaft is the remnants of the steel bar
that broke her fall

The very spot where she died

INT DEN - NIGHT
Laura looks over Charles’s desk
His mad gallery of child mortalities gateways serpent
insignia phantom children with no hands in screams of
eternal despair

“a child with no hands unable

to knock at the gates of Heaven

was fated to wander the earth in

limbo
She unconsciously toys with her silver locket - flashing open
Naomi’s face

INT DUMB WAITER SHAFT - NIGHT

Charles finds himself quite overcome with emotion He finds
the strength to start moving again

Searching for some loose stone or tunnel It doesn’t take
long to finds something - a gap under an overhang

His light reveals a tunnel that runs off from the base of the
shaft He wriggles his way under pulling a hammer and cold
chisel with him

He is in a small low space with a sunken floor The size and
shape of a coffin

CHARLES

wedges the chisel and starts hammering prying away at the
brick

Working it loose

Drenched in sweat he has now switched to a sledgehammer He
swings as best he can in the cramped spaced and dislodges a
big chunk of brick

He swings again his palms blistering

Sending more bits of stone flying

With a final almighty swing a whole CHUNK of brick flies up

Panting and covered in sweat he fumbles for his torch and
peers in to find -

Absolutely nothing

The sunken ‘coffin’ if that’s what it was is as empty and
as hollow as a drum No secret openings No latches No
bones Nothing

EXT DR AYSHE’S OFFICE - DAY

Dr Ayshe considers the tormented exhausted mess sitting
opposite her with his raw and blistered palms

DR AYSHE
Are you familiar with the Thomas
Theorem It’s the basis for any
self-fulfilling prophecy

If he isn’t he soon will be

DR AYSHE (CONTD)

It says “If a man defines a
situation as real it is real in
its consequences”

CHARLES
They’re in there somewhere They
have to be

He has unearthed more evidence for her to study - old
property deeds civic registrar

CHARLES (CONTD)
Look - here’s the census entry for
the original owner See - three
children They’ve all got birth
dates but no recorded deaths They
just disappear

DR AYSHE
Maybe they simply grew up and moved
away

She extends a hand Stops him bringing out any more papers

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
We have a saying in Turkey Fall
not into the fire to avoid smoke

Which means want exactly

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
People only choose painful
solutions because facing up to the
real problem underneath is even
more painful -

CHARLES
I lost a child What could be more
painful than that

DR AYSHE
The feeling that you deserved it

She meets his eyes with a level gaze

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
It’s only natural You’re human
But you’ve moved beyond the normal
levels of guilt into a very
elaborate form of self-punishment
And the consequences are all
negative Which only makes you feel
worse and want to punish yourself
more

As she studies his face a hint of compassion creeps into her
manner

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
It’s a vicious cycle but you have
the strength to break it

We push deep into his eyes - wanting so hard to believe her -
as the sound of rhythmic footsteps rise up -

INT BEDROOM - DAY

He showers Shaves under his chin Knots a tie - not too
tight Careful not to disturb his sleeping wife

DR AYSHE (VO)
You have been looking for an answer
everywhere except the one place
that will actually help
The footsteps get louder and more insistent

DR AYSHE (VO) (CONT’D)
Inside your self

He inspects his reflection He’s ready

INT BEDROOM - DAY

He showers Shaves under his chin Knots a tie - not too
tight Careful not to disturb his sleeping wife

DR AYSHE (V0)
You have been looking for an answer
everywhere except the one place
that will actually help
The footsteps get louder and more insistent

DR AYSHE (VO) (CONT’D)
Inside your self

He inspects his reflection He’s ready

EXT SQUARE - DAY

He heads purposefully towards a vast modern complex -
gleaming in the rising sun

The footsteps weve been hearing are his own

INT BUILDING - DAY

Echoing across the cavernous atrium until he comes to a stop
at the reception desk

CHARLES
Charles Hilderbrand Dr Ayshe sent
me

VOICE

Mr Hilderbrand

A small round MAN in a Nehru suit walks over and shakes his
hand

SMALL MAN
Meyer R Schkolnic “Inhuman
resources”
(ho ho)
I’m your liaison for the day

He indicates a new direction
SMALL MAN (CONTD)
Your appointment’s been switched to

the building

The Small Man makes a weird twirly hand motion Turn around
and all will be revealed

EXT BUILDING - DAY

They cross another square two tiny dots increasingly bereft
of other people

SMALL MAN
As you can see it’s all very new
No signs No floor numbers

INT NEW BUILDING - DAY

SMALL MAN
And no help

The unmanned reception desk is still covered in plastic
sheeting

SMALL MAN (CONTD)
You have to be a mind reader to
work here

He gives a camp laugh

SMALL MAN (CONTD)
Which as luck would have it

He waddles over to the elevators agonizing over which side
to choose

SMALL MAN (CONTD)
Ahhh Un tiens vaut mieux que
deux tu lauras No
Subtitle “One certainty is better than two possibilities”

Finally he presses a button

SMALL MAN (CONTD)
Suite 12-07 if I’m not mistaken

Above them Charles notices a wall clock ticking towards
1203 The doors pings open and he steps onto the elevator
INT ELEVATOR - DAY

-- Only for the Small Man to step back as the doors snap
shut

SMALL MAN
Okay that was a lie

Charles realizes that all this strangeness is now very
familiar

The elevator is filled with the same people from the day
Naomi disappeared

MATRONLY LADY
Let’s get to it shall we It’s
quite a litany

It is one of the matronly Ladies who laughed about Naomi
one with the red earrings She steps forward with polite
menace

MATRONLY LADY (CONT’D)

You were drinking You were very
close to being fired - again You
were disappearing for days on end
You were screwing around You were
lying to your wife You were lying
to your daughter You’d just missed
her birthday Her second birthday
if that helps pinpoint it There
were other instances of
‘absenteeism’ but we’1ll confine
ourselves to the pivotal incident

(her glacial civility is

paralyzing)
If you have no objections

Charles is not quite sure where this is leading
MATRONLY LADY 2

(chiming in helpfully)
The miscarriage

Now Charles knows exactly where this is heading He starts

pressing elevator buttons Any one will do
MATRONLY LADY
Don’t by shy We’re all friends
here
The doors open and he exits only to find himself -

IN ANOTHER ELEVATOR

This is older - a vintage cage - with all the same people
facing him

MATRONLY LADY 2
It’s not like we’re telling you
anything you don’t already know

The

MATRONLY LADY
If you’d just manage to behave
yourself none of this would have
happened would it

MATRONLY 2
Would it

MATRONLY LADY
You wouldn’t have needed to run
away You wouldn’t have needed
to change countries sorry
continents -

CHARLES
- I didn’t run away -

MATRONLY LADY
So much baggage You had to go back
20 years in order to make a “fresh

start”

CHARLES
I didn’t run away I faced what I
did

MATRONLY LADY
Fine Whatever Very impressive
You owned up She forgave you You
made things right

She fixes him with a pitiless gaze

MATRONLY LADY (CONTD)
By coming here and losing another
child

MATRONLY LADY 2
You couldn’t even hold onto her
hand

The all laugh at this elemental howler

CHARLES
It wasn’t like that

MATRONLY LADY
It was exactly like that

MATRONLY LADY (CONTD)
Why do you think this thing chose
you Pure luck

The Small Man gives a Naomi-like wave as the doors snap shut

SMALL MAN
Guilty feet have got no rhythm”

The elevator suddenly drops flinging Charles against the
wall The freefall pulls back his jowls like some nightmarish
facelift

This amuses them no end When he makes a grab for the
emergency handle they laugh even more pitifully

MATRONLY LADY
You don’t get it do you He
doesn’t get it

MAN
Let’s see if we can spell it out
The toothpaste is out the tube

MATRONLY LADY 2
The genie is out the bottle

MAN
The noose is on and the chair
kicked away

Charles yanks the handle but it comes off in his hand The
sickening acceleration flattens his face against the wall

MATRONLY LADY
You just can’t see it can you

She grabs his chin forcing him to look at her
MATRONLY LADY (CONT’D)
It doesn’t matter what you do it’s

too late

The elevator screams to the bottom and certain impact as -

INT CAR - NIGHT

Charles blinks awake and tries to get his bearings His hand
is indeed on some kind of handle only this one opens

After a moment in this strange darkness he discovers the
nightmare is still going on

Shadowy FIGURES are closing in on him hovering over him
shaking him

He struggles but they grab him tighter He lashes out It’s
all too dark and close to see clearly They pounce dragging
him out into the cold

He lashes out more violently and hits something - a chin a
nose He makes a break for it only to crumple under the
immobilizing WHACK of some kind of stick

REAL DARKNESS THIS TIME

Charles ‘comes to’ - seconds later face down on the road as
something metal SNAPS tight on his hands

One of the Figures is inspecting out incriminating items from
Charles’ car strange old drawings bunches of recent
newspaper clippings and most alarmingly a bag with his jug
of acetic acid (just like Sonia’s) flashlight matches

Charles belatedly realizes the figures are PATROLMEN and he
is outside the Old House where he must have fallen asleep

INT DR AYSHE’S OFFICE - DAY

Dr Ayshe takes in Charles’s cut lip bruised scraped-up
face and the red raw marks on his wrists

DR AYSHE
I think we’ve reached the point
where we have to consider some
medication

She writes out a prescription and offers it to him It’s a
little like a declaration of surrender for him to accept

He looks and reads
Pedakin Reskalith-HF 100g
Is she kidding It’s the same stuff Sonia was taking

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
It’s a mood regulator -

CHARLES
(screwing it up)
I know what it is

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Laura tidies and cleans unnecessarily her habit when faced
with difficult emotions

LAURA
Were right back where we started
arent we First your disappearing
act Then the calls from work

Charles sits at the table His bruised face and ghosted
unshaven appearance do nothing to dilute her onslaught

LAURA (CONT’D)

Now we’ve got complaints from the
school

The kitchen is completely spotless now but still she cleans
LAURA (CONTD)
What’s the matter with you Every
time we look like making progress -
you have to fuck it up Why

It is more of an impassioned plea than an accusation But
what can he say She looks deep into his eyes

LAURA (CONTD)
Why
When she doesn’t get a reply -

LAURA (CONTD)

We’re not moving and that’s that

You want to run away Fine Go
CHARLES

I’m not running from anything I’m

trying to make things right

LAURA
Then start with Jessica

She indicates down the hall to her bedroom

CHARLES
I’1l go talk to her in a minute

He gets up and put his arms around her
LAURA
Why don’t you go now
INT HALLWAY - DAY
He taps on Jessica’s door slightly ajar

CHARLES
Jessica

INT JESSICA’S BEDROOM - DAY

It’s empty He hears the muffled DRONE of the shower
Realizes she’s in the bathroom He enters and sits on her
bed taking in her things books clothes - trying perhaps to
re-connect with who she is

He flicks over a “LIFE AFTER LOSS” pamphlet on her desk
suggesting “10 Way to Cope with Grief”

Read poetry or books
Engage in social activities
Eat good foods
Take time to relax
Listen to music
He gets as far as number 5 Tosses aside in disbelief

Finds himself inspecting her journals instead - without
judgement

“What did we do We didn’t do anything I didn’t do
anything

“Dad is mad Dad is bad Dad is sad Its like I cant
breathe”
INT HALLWAY - DAY

Unnoticed behind him the hall carpet starts to darken Water
creeping out from under the bathroom door

Laura sits in her spotless kitchen turning and turning a
coffee cup her face set firm

Above her the light flickers

INT JESSICA’S BEDROOM - DAY

Charles turns more pages and the schoolgirlish handwriting
give way to more recent drawings Harshly ground black pencil
making virulent swirls

A neurotic outpouring of undirected energy on every page A
mass of swirls - like waves maybe

No they’re more like flames - curling encircling
The sound of crackling of flames Suddenly he’s watching the

incinerator burning Sonia’s clippings - the sparks snapping
at his clothes

The light flickers above Charles too as the seeping water
spreads into Jessica’s room

But he is too engrossed in Jessica’s drawings as they leap
into color becoming more overwhelming and intense with every
page

Until the last page is a glistening still-wet impasto of
flaming red

Smudging it with his thumb - it’s blood

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Laura reacts as the light bulb blows out above her

INT JESSICA’S BEDROOM - DAY

Charles turns and sees a dark stain spreads stealthily across
the carpet

He steps forward and realizes the stain on the carpet is
water squelching under his feet

CHARLES
Jessica

Water is now glistening in a POOL by the bathroom door

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Laura hurries from the kitchen hearing the alarm in his
voice

CHARLES
Jess Open up

He rattles the handle expecting it to be locked But it
opens easily - until the door hits the build-up of water
behind the door

Finally he gets it open and pulls back the shower curtain
Laura following him in

LAURA
Oh my God

INT BATHROOM - DAWN

Jessica is slumped in the overflowing shower still in her
underwear a mess of vomit and watery blood

A pair of manicure scissors dangles from her fingers blood
leaking from her hacked wrists as -

ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

An ambulance a stretcher rushing medics frantically
loading Jessica into the van as the lights flash and the
sirens wail

INT AMBULANCE - MOVING - DAY

Charles and Laura next to their daughter in the back stuck
in a nightmare loop that never ends

INT INTENSIVE CARE - DAY
A hushed white room

Jessica in a room asleep - her face pale her wrists
bandaged as the IV drip is replaced and the heart monitor
checked

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Charles and Laura keep vigil outside Two profiles on the
bench just like at the police station

There are a few magazines and toys in the reception area But
the big draw - for a couple of restless KIDS at least - is a
low table with a model of the hospital

THE DOOR OPENS

And DR GAZIRI emerges to taken them aside and give them the
news He is an authoritative professional

DR GAZIRI
Jessica is doing very well for us
She’s physically stable with no
complications She needs to
rehydrate a little more but she
regurgitated most of the pills
before they could be absorbed into
her system We had to put a couple
of stitches into the cuts

(MORE )

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
But luckily the muscle in the
radial artery contracted and
limited the blood loss It probably
looked a lot worse than it was

They’re not too sure about that

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
You should know attempted suicide
is the biggest cause of hospitali-
zation among adolescents Even more
so in families that have already
suffered intense trauma

He gives them a reassuring look

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
There’s actually a lot to be
hopeful about

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Laura enters and takes in her daughter hooked up like some
captive alien Determined to be strong for her

A NURSE wheels in a fold-out bed and blankets

NURSE
If you need any help setting this
up just press this button The
bathroom and shower are through
there

She nods thanks as the Nurse leaves gradually becoming aware
of Charles’s quite different energy behind her She steels
herself waiting for the other shoe to drop and sure enough -

CHARLES
This is why we have to leave

Laura closes her eyes

CHARLES (CONTD)
If she stays here she’1ll die

LAURA
This is the best hospital in the
country

CHARLES

You didn’t see her drawings There
were pages of flames

LAURA
Dr Gaziri is the top specialist -

CHARLES
Page after page of fire You know
what they called burning fever
Lamia’s disease -

LAURA
She didn’t burn the house down She
didn’t set herself on fire She cut
her wrists

She is not going to argue in front of her daughter even if
she is unconscious She heads for the side-room

CHARLES
I know you think I’m crazy but I
don’t care This is just like Naomi
all over again -

She snaps turning on him

LAURA
This is nothing like what happened
to Naomi Didn’t you hear Dr
Gaziri This is our mess We did
this Weren’t you listening
Thirteen-year-old girls do commit
suicide All the time And not
because of some mumbo-jumbo
reasons For real reasons Because
it’s better than feeling let down
and abandoned It’s better than
watching your father fall apart

All her buried anger flares to surface

LAURA (CONTD)
This is your doing You did this

It is a terrible moment and they both know it If she says
any more there may be no taking it back

CHARLES
I’m not trying to hurt you I’m
trying to save you

LAURA
Then stop

She waits imploring him with her eyes But all he can see is
the veins on Jessica’s arms - tensing and standing out

And the flash of some ghostly CHILD outside in the hall -
SCREAMING in agony

CHARLES
This is a cursed place You have to
know that

He is even sounding like Sonia now

Laura reacts as if he means the hospital Here Really This
place with the blankets and vase of flowers

She retreats to the sideroom in exasperation shutting the
door on him

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL RESTROOM - NIGHT

Safely alone she can let out the emotions that reflect what
she really feels Her husband is going insane

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

On the other side of the door Charles is reaching his own
conclusion Sad but accepting

So be it

He sizes up the corridor seeing where the nurses are making
a decision

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Bare feet shuffle across the linoleum as Charles steers
Jessica wrapped in his coat to the fire exit

He wrestles with the door It’s tricky work keeping her
upright at the same time She is slurred and shaky Like a
happy drunk

JESSICA
Where’s Mom

CHARLES
She’s joining us later

JESSICA
Under the clock At twelve
oclock

She’s telling this to a JANITOR who’s coming out of the
stairwell

JANITOR
Is she a patient
He’s spotted the hospital tag on Jessica’s wrist
JANITOR (CONTD)
If she’s a patient she can’t
leave from here She has to be
checked out at the front desk

Charles nods as if it’s all fine

CHARLES
We’re just getting some air

But Jessica grabs the bannister to steady herself - suddenly
nauseated It’s like something takes her over from behind her
eyes

CHARLES (CONT’D)
Jess -

Out of nowhere her whole body arcs back as if zapped by a
massive JOLT of electricity

JANITOR
Holy shit

She is slammed backwards onto the steel stairs - her back
ARCHING violently

Laura grabs her head to protect it getting his knuckles
SLAMMED against the sharp metal steps

The Janitor races off for help Hitting an alarm button
MEDICS

leap into action Calling a “Code Blue”

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOMSIDE ROOM - NIGHT

Laura looks up from washing her face at the noise

She emerges to see Jessicas telltale empty bed sees the
ORDERLIES running past

INT HOSPITAL STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Dr Gaziri directs the Orderlies to contain the patient’s

flailing limbs moving Charles out the way But the violence
of Jessica’s SPASMS only increases

DR GAZIRI
Get me a flange before she bites
her tongue Prep 200mg of Exocin

A MEDIC snaps open the case rips open a syringe packet It’s
hard to focus next to the animalistic HOWLS

MEDIC
Ready

DR GAZIRI
Hold her arm still

The Orderlies make a concerted effort straining like a tug-
of-war team as the needle hovers to find a vein

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
I need her still

Finally the needle goes in and he depresses the plunger of
potent pink sedative

But it makes NO DIFFERENCE

Laura rushes up to see spasms rip through her daughters
body sending the men’s shoes slipping across the metal Her
knee SMACKS into an Orderly’s teeth

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
Where’s the flange

The flanged tube is inserted roughly into Jessica’s mouth
She is thrashing wildly it pops right back out

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
Hold it in

Jessica’s arm slips free grabbing an Orderly’s fingers -
bending them backwards He screams Jessica has BROKEN his
wrist snapping it backwards so it dangles uselessly

The Janitor throws up in his mouth

Jessicas hospital clothes ripped in the struggle reveal
her heart pounding against her rib cage Laura can clearly
see it thumping through the skin as if trying to break free

On the side of her rib cage the skin contorts getting
stretched into strange points

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
We need a brace The ribs are
fracturing

JUNIOR
Brace

Someone goes running Dr Gaziri takes an Orderly’s big hand
and jams it over the splintering bones - like holding back a
dam

DR GAZIRI
Press down here or the skin is
going to rip open

Dr Gaziri has to make a life or death decision

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
I need 400mg of Methoxilate

The Junior Medic already in way over his head hesitates
This stuff is never used on children

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
400mg Now

The Orderlies are running out of adrenaline Four of them and
it’s like wrestling a steer

MEDIC
Ready

Dr Gaziri takes the prepped syringe as another rib CRACKS
tearing the skin under the Orderly’s hand

She jabs in the needle and empties it Jessica’s spasm is so
violent the metal needle SNAPS clean off

INT HOSPITAL ROOM —- DAY
Silence The aftermath

Baffled doctors gathered round Jessica’s body strapped down
at the wrists and ankles She is unconscious now but still
breathing heavily Even through the chest brace her rib cage
heaves up and down

An Orderly shows a colleague the flange It is a piece of
rubber thick enough to stop a rottweiler Her 12-year-old
teeth have ground it flat

The doctors look at X-rays MRIs and PET scans

RADIOLOGIST
Her brain is swelling so rapidly
it’s causing diastatic fractures
along the suture lines

DR MUHREN
That’s impossible That only
happens in infants

The Radiologist shows him the evidence

DR MUHREN (CONT’D)
Why did you wait You should have
called me the moment this happened

DR MUHREN is the senior brain specialist studying the PET
scans

DR GAZIRI
We did This only happened 55
minutes ago

Dr Muhren returns to the thermal screens - a relentless
rampage of frenzied red

DR MUHREN
This can’t be right Check the
machine

INT INTENSIVE CARE - NIGHT

But the machines are working fine The Experts huddle to
collate their evidence

DR MUHREN
Is it possible she was exposed to
some kind of radiation leak Or
some kind of intense magnetic
field

He’s clutching at straws and they know it

DR GAZIRI
I gave her enough anaesthetic to
stop a racehorse Her heart has
been going at 195bpm for two hours
Her temperature is 108

Dr Muhren studies the latest thermal readings Looks at the
PET scan of her body

Jessica’s skin has gone a strange burnt red color The
surface is so acidic it has melted the fingertips off the
Orderlies’ latex gloves

DR MUHREN
I’ve never seen anything like it

He looks around None of them have

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Charles and Laura wait for more news sitting tensely trying
to decode the expressions on the Nurses who enter and exit

Laura won’t even look at Charles This is just as well
because SOMEONE is trying to get his attention - someone that
only he can see
GHOSTLY BOY’S VOICE
When are you going to understand
It doesn’t matter what you do It’s
too late
It is a GHOSTLY WHITE BOY tugging at Charles’ sleeve
GHOSTLY BOY
In fact the more you struggle
the worse you make it
The Boy tilts his head back with a sickly laugh

GHOSTLY BOY (CONTD)
Believe me I know

Across his throat is the raw rope burn of a noose

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Doctors react as another SPASM shoots through Jessica’s
body making her metal bed SCRAPE across the floor sending
ICE PACKS arranged around her overheating body to the floor
Jessica’s monitors spike Heart Brain Temperature All
racing out of control

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Laura reacts first as Dr Gaziri emerges

This time there is nothing to be hopeful about

INT DR GAZIRI’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Dr Gaziri gestures for Charles and Laura to take a seat and
shuts the door

DR GAZIRI
Sit down

He’s not asking He’s insisting

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
Please

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
Her heart is beating so violently
it’s causing fissures in the
arteries The swelling in her brain
is splitting the membranes Her pH
balance has gone haywire She is
producing so much acid she’s
corroding herself -

LAURA
Because she fell on some stairs

DR GAZIRI
This has nothing to do with falling
or stairs Or cutting an artery

CHARLES
Then what is it

Ominous cracks are showing through Dr Gaziri’s professional
confidence A 30-year veteran of the most extreme traumas
and he is overwhelmed

DR GAZIRI
We don’t know

They sit Terrified It feels like a death sentence Because
it is one

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
We have to make a decision Right
now We have the option if you
want to arrange what we call a
“lucid window”

They stare at him quietly

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)
It means we can disrupt her
anaesthetic so she regains
consciousness It would only be for
a few minutes I cannot risk making
it any longer The pain would be
excruciating But it would give you
a little time together to say
goodbye

LAURA
What do you mean “goodbye”

They try to take this all in This is all happening so fast

LAURA (CONTD)
What do you mean “goodbye” She was
perfectly healthy 24 hours ago

DR GAZIRI

At this point her condition is so
severe all we can do is make sure
she doesn’t feel any pain

LAURA
I don’t understand What are you
telling me

CHARLES
He’s saying they can’t save her

LAURA
No no no This can’t happen You
have to figure this out

She’s on her feet standing up to him grabbing him

DR GAZIRI
We’‘re doing everything we can

LAURA
Then get someone else

DR GAZIRI
There is no one else

Charles pulls her away

DR GAZIRI (CONTD)

You have to understand Everything
that should make it better makes
it worse It’s like she boiling
herself alive with everything we
give her - sedatives anti-
convulsant even water It’s like
her whole nervous system is
is

CHARLES
On fire

Gradually the stark reality sinks in and Laura’s strength
crumbles

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
It already feels like a tomb The injection of the anti-
anaesthetic is like the last rites solemnly watched by staff
and parents
The Anesthesiologist withdraws the syringe Notes the time
ANESTHESIOLOGIST

She should come around at 2am

Maybe a little before
Laura and Charles look at the clock - that’s just 45 minutes

The medical staff discreetly withdraw to give them some
privacy

One by one they quietly exit until Charles and Laura are
alone

Laura stares at her daughter - her features barely
recognizable thanks to the virulent swelling and bruising -
barely able to take a step towards her

CHARLES
You still think I did this

Laura doesn’t know what to think anymore
Charles takes his wife’s hand

LAURA
How can this be happening

Her only answer is the beep of the monitor And Jessicas
relentless breathing

And the unstoppable ticking of the clock

It is no longer a question of who’s to blame or right or
wrong They’re all victims now

Laura doesn’t know what to do so she tidies up the side
table with its gesture of some flowers in a vase But she’s a
wreck and she knocks over the vase

CHARLES
Ill get it

She insists on fixing it but only succeeds in dropping the
vase

CHARLES (CONTD)
Will you leave it

The tension in his voice is horrible What’s he attacking her
for Laura carries on regardless

LAURA
This is the last thing she’s going
to see

This bleak room full of apparatus

CHARLES
She’s going to see us You

He softens and guides her to a bedside chair

LAURA
God I’m a mess

CHARLES
You look fine

She touches Jessica’s lurid flaking arm

LAURA
She’s burning up
She gets a cold press from the ice bucket and dabs at
Jessica’s swollen forehead It’s more of a gesture than
anything

LAURA (CONTD)
Maybe we should get some more ice

Noise filters in from the hallway -

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

The two kids playing with the hospital model finally lose
it A TANTRUM Shrieking Tears The Grandparent out of her
depth

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Charles tries to shut it out as he faces his forlorn daughter
strapped down as if on some Procrustean table

He takes in this grim sight - strapped at the ankles
strapped at the wrists

Her thickened veins

Her bestially heaving chest

The minutes ticking by pitilessly

His distraught wife She flinches as the SHRIEKING TANTRUM
resumes outside at a higher more grating pitch

Charles storms outside -

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

A NURSE is trying to help the Grandparent take the flailing
thrashing kid outside

Charles stops Shouting at them isn’t going to help In fact
as it stands nothing is going to help

The Ghostly Boy hovers in the background “See What did I
tell you”

Charles turns back and re-enters but as he does so his step
falters and his face changes Not with defeat anymore With
an idea

He looks back at the miniature hospital - a scale model The
idea growing in his mind

LAURA
Reacts as Charles moves to the bed His energy changed

He goes and kisses his unconscious daughter - a long intense
kiss on her forehead He is moving with purpose now

LAURA
What is it

He crouches down - eye to eye with her- and takes her wrists
in his hands

CHARLES
We might still have a chance

She is confused by his sudden intensity Even more so when he
pulls her close and kisses her

CHARLES (CONTD)
Talk to her

He gets up moving to the door

CHARLES (CONTD)
Keep talking Don’t give up

It was she realizes a goodbye kiss She follows panicking
trying to stop him but he’s moving too fast

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

LAURA
What are you doing Where are you
going

But he’s already out of sight down the stairs Her gaze
lands on the scale model of the hospital confused

EXT OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

The jagged silhouette of their old house caught in the swirl
of clouds across a night sky

We hear the

SMASH of glass -

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT
As he kicks in the basement window only just repaired

The house feels strangely alive - like an oven - because the
builders are drying out the newly plastered walls still damp
under Charles’ touch

He moves past the huge old boiler roaring agitatedly - flames
flickering in the pilot light window - to the sheet-covered
shape he moved aside on his last visit

He pulls off the sheet to reveal the antique toy house as we
hear his and Naomi’s conversation from before

CHARLES (VO)
All right where is it

NAOMI (VO)
It’s in the secret place

CHARLES (VO)
Oh the secret place Not the
regular place
(Naomi - not playing
along)
Come on where is it

NAOMI (VO)
I told you it’s a secret

CHARLES (VO)
Hey You want to go shopping or
not

The antique replica toy house

INT BASEMENT - WORKSPACE - NIGHT

Under a work lamp Charles LEVERS off the roof to find a maze
of eerily accurate replica rooms

He pokes his way through sweeping out a dead fly a flurry
of dust He finds closets and corridors even the dumb waiter
shaft and chimney

But no secret place

Sweat dots his forehead as the pressure mounts

His attention shifts to the roof He flips it over and places
it upside-down like a turtle shell revealing a replica

ceiling

Charles pries this off to expose the innards of the topsy-
turvy roof - an elaborate crisscross of beams and struts

In the centre is one sealed section - the size of a small
room

Charles pokes around this section with a screwdriver looking
for a way in

Finally something SQUEAKS

His work lamp spotlights steps the back of a tiny closet
Using a screwdriver he finds a sliding panel of ridged wood
Except it only slides back and forth about half an inch

There’s no way in

He removes his screwdriver to ponder this setback when the
panel promptly flops open like a drawbridge

In the wall is a small square hole

Charles brings his lamp nearer and peers in

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Dr Gaziri arrives and introduces the Anesthesiologist

ANESTHESIOLOGIST
(to Jessica)
Not long now

He opens his case of chemicals starts preparing a syringe

INT CLOSET - NIGHT
A CROWBAR

wrenches off a brand new modern panel to reveal -

THE ORIGINAL RIDGED PANEL

behind it It is a little worm-eaten and threadbare but the
same as in the toy house Except it won’t slide to one side

Charles tries again and again sweat on his brow now but it
wont budge

Unlike the replica this one comes with sliding wooden locks
disguised among the ornamental ridges

He has to figure out the sequence and it’s not easy

Until Charles finally works out the sequence - the wooden
latches must be turned to form a circle

He heaves the panel to one side - just six inches across but
sure enough it stiffly swings down like an oven door

INT SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

A FLASH LIGHT

flares into life as Charles clambers through and lights up -
AN OLD WORKPLACE

With sloping rooftop walls untouched for centuries thick
with floating dust and hardened dirt

In the centre is a thick wooden workbench

He wipes away the crud and finds vicious gouges in the
corners Could this be the place where they were killed

His mind flashes to Jessica’s in hospital - laid out with her
wrists in restraints

His flash light scours the tiny room but there are no other
signs Just something irritating the back of his neck

He wipes it off - it’s like dust but more flaky And it
keeps coming

He ducks backwards out the way only to get snagged by thick
dangling mass of cobwebs

He swipes them away prompting even more flakes and something
worse which he now sees right above his head -

THREE PETRIFIED CORPSES
Fixed to the low ceiling

His light clatters to the floor as he falls backwards as -

INT JESSICA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Anesthesiologist accidentally jabs himself with a needle
as he prepares to inject Jessica

He’s a cool professional This is an very uncharacteristic
mistake seemingly nowhere

INT SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

Charles steadies himself and shines the light up again There
they are - the three children shrivelled and dried but

otherwise preserved

Bony feet Mortified faces Mouths agape Arm bones that end
above the wrist

The sound of SCRATCHING draws his light downwards to find -
A small pink mouse A few of them in fact Eyes glowing red
like in a camera flash before they scurry away slipping INTO

the extra thick single column that supports the tabletop

The column he sees is ornate and carved as if with a
thousand windows or vents Which means it is hollow

Is it Charles’s imagination or can he feel ripples of hot air
coming out of it

THE TABLETOP

Is smashed aside His light shines into the column to reveal
a straight drop down through the bowels of the house

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Anesthesiologist pulls our the needle for the “wake-up”
dose

ANESTHESIOLOGIST
Just a few minutes
INT SECRET ROOM SHAFT - NIGHT
A FLASH LIGHT
Makes its way down fixed to Charles belt
The SHAFT

Is rudimentary and rough which provides a good grip for
shoes but lacerates the hands

He gets to the bottom - sweat pouring off him now his shirt
soaked It is boiling like a furnace

He has we see lowered by rope a bag ahead of him

It is rough rock and dirt down here like a low damp cave -
slimy and fetid thick with swirling dust

But there is no doubt what the point of interest is - some
kind of low altar at the far end

Charles forced to crouch moves closer

Engraved in the stone ledge is a circle about a two feet in
diameter Wiping around the edge Charles scrapes away who
knows how many years of muck and dirt

Sure enough the symbol of the two SNAKES emerges

So what then is in the center

Then he brings his light closer and closer So he can take in
every detail as he wipes away the slop and muck to reveal

THE GATEWAY

It is a strange glistening slightly protruding STONE
ORIFICE seemingly formed by nature in the rock

Like a screaming mouth or some Freudian nightmare

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Jessica’s eyes gently open She takes it her surroundings
Looks at her Mother sitting there clasping her hand Or
rather looks through her

There is no sense of recognition

INT UNDER THE HOUSE - NIGHT
From his bag Charles eases out his jug of acid

He gasps for air in the stifling humidity fatigue and cramp
attacking his limbs

He sets the acid down by the altar - the jug almost falling
from his tired slippery grasp

He eases out the stopper avoiding too late the eye-stinging
wisps of smoke

He takes a breath to ready himself Maybe even a silent
prayer as -

The sight of the Gateway makes him falter

His hands are like lead around the glass jug as he tilts it
forward taking the plunge emptying the jug in one go

All he can see and HEAR are flashes of Sonia’s gruesome final
moments in the cemetery - SCREAMING in terror as her jug
smashes on the stone splashing acid all over her

The lethal torrent glugs into the hole wispy fumes stinging
his eyes and nostrils making his vision swim with yet more
flashes of Sonia’s death

He is braced for a similar reaction - the earth to shake the
walls to scream But the corrosive tide merely flushes down
into the bowels of the earth

And then the cave is silent And the house too Even the low
rumble of the boiler has stopped

Charles sits back on his haunches Waiting for what A sign
An explosion But there’s nothing Not a sound

Did it work Did it make any difference There’s no way to
tell

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Laura strokes Jessica’s hair

LAURA
Honey it’s me

But the light in her daughter’s eyes is fading away

INT UNDER THE HOUSE - NIGHT

Charles fumbles for his matches Strikes a light only for the
head to crumble They are the thick cooking kind of matches
but the damp from his sweat ruined

He strikes another And another Wet and useless Is it his
imagination or is the ground starting to rumble beneath him
like an earthquake tremor

He frantically finds a dry match and gets it alight only for
it to fizzle under a drop of sweat from his brow

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Laura grips her daughter’s hand

LAURA
Jessica it’s Mom

Jessica eyelids slowly fall shut as she slips away

INT UNDER THE HOUSE - NIGHT

Charles shakes out the box Picks out what looks like the
last dry match Gets it alight Keeps it alight

And moves hands cupped towards the hole The flame flickers
as his hands shake There is no question he is feeling a
tremor beneath him And now a

SHIMMERING LIGHT

Refracts through the empty jug It is too clear a light to be
from the match It can only be a ghost

He freezes feeling a presence behind him prickling his
neck But the flame is burning down in his cupped hands He
goes to drop the match onto the acid when he hears a child’s
disapproving tutting

It is Naomi Standing there Hands behind her back Frowning

The match is burning down His last one

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Jessica’s vital signs are all descending

INT UNDER THE HOUSE - NIGHT

Naomi is shaking her head Don’t do it But Charles turns
away shutting her out and puts the match to the hole just
in time to ignite the acid

The effect is a brief beautiful glow of fire running into the
earth then nothing

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Jessica’s arm and hand go limp in her mother’s grip The
Doctors quietly swap looks That’s that

INT SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

Charles watches the hole go dark as if the flames burnt out
Then nothing but silence And Naomi stepping forwarding

shaking her head in disappointment

NAOMI
All you did was make her mad

She takes another step forward Is she coming to embrace him
or attack him

NAOMI (CONT’D)
Here -

She steps up close - her skin drained of all blood - bringing
her arms out from behind her back into the beam of light

Charles recoils backwards smashing the light in a flash of
bloody stumps as

FLAMES

Erupt from the hole

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

And Jessica’s body SPASMS as if hit by electricity some
unholy noise coming out of her body

Her readings all SPIKE off the charts as her restraints SNAP
TIGHT

INT SHAFT - NIGHT

Charles scrambles up the SHAFT blasted by scorching heat
Hauling himself back into the secret room the ground shaking
under him It’s like the whole house is coming alive with
rage

INT CLOSET - NIGHT

He fights his way back out of the closet and onto the
landing Tripping slipping under this earthquake as
billowing black smoke spreads around him

INT LANDING - NIGHT

He gropes his way to the top of the stairs struggling to
stay upright

But before he takes two steps a grating SCRATCHING noise
makes him pause
INT JESSICA’S ROOM - NIGHT

It’s Jessica seen through the open door Carving a circle in
the wall using a piece of jagged glass

She is gripping the broken glass so tightly blood should be
flowing from her palm

JESSICA
What’s round and mean

Charles steps towards her

CHARLES
Here let me take that

JESSICA
A vicious circle

Well she thinks it’s funny

He takes her hand It is solid but there are no cuts or
stitches

JESSICA (CONTD)
You still think this is real
He gently pries away the jagged glass which certainly cuts
his skin and makes his wince
INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Jessica BUCKS so violently the stitches on her wrists start
to come apart

Now Jessica looks at her mother with real recognition She
is without a doubt in real pain

INT JESSICA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Charles leads Jessica towards the stairs - she smears a
bloody palm on the wall Black choking smoke is now

everywhere from below come huge eddies of dust and ash

JESSICA
I like it here I want to stay

Charles sees the ground floor is COVERED with fire - a
rippling carpet of flames crawling up the walls and
bannisters

JESSICA (CONTD)
See It’s a good pain

He turns back the way they came but the door to her room is
mysteriously now closed

He tries the handle but it is white hot

CHARLES
Come on Let’s go

He pulls her with him

JESSICA
Where to

He tries the handle on his old bedroom but it comes off in
his hand

She laughs

Flames creep up the stairs onto the landing gathering
shocking momentum

He retreats to the only door left The one still with the
faint outline of Naomi’s sign
He rattles at the door expecting trouble but it opens
easily
INT NAOMI’S ROOM - NIGHT

There is Naomi’s view - her circular window - and the rolling
night-time clouds beyond it

Behind him the door starts to close on Jessica as her hand
pulls free of his

He turns just in time GRABBING her wrist as the door shuts
on his knuckles trying to break his grip

The heavy door SQUEEZES remorselessly almost severing his
grip on Jessica as the hallway is devoured in flames

CHARLES
Hold on
INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Laura holds Jessicas hand as her body SPASMS again - like
another jolt being unleashed through her

JESSICA
Mom it burns

Jessica’s nails dig deep into the skin on her mother’s hand

INT NAOMI’S ROOM - NIGHT

With one final almighty heave Charles pulls Jessica through
onto the floor as the door SLAMS shut on the deadly FLAMES
outside -

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

The Doctors scurry to apply a painkiller as Jessicas
piercing SCREAM of agony fills the room

LAURA
You said she wouldn’t feel
anything

INT NAOMI’S ROOM - NIGHT

It is strangely peaceful in here No fires no flames Just
the distant glow of moonlight over a trestle table of paints
bottles brushes

Charles and Laura are both on the floor He looks into his
daughter’s eyes encouraged She looks like her old self
Like she trusts him

He gets to his knees loosening his already open collar
struggling for air

CHARLES
Let’s get outside Then well be
fine

He tries to help her to her feet

CHARLES (CONT’D)
Come on

But she shakes her head

JESSICA
She won’t let you

CHARLES
Who

She nods at the corner behind him

JESSICA
Her

He looks but there’s nobody there Just darkness

JESSICA (cont’d) (CONT’D)
Her

Gradually his eyes adjust and he makes out -
The inky silhouette of a terrifying BLACK FIGURE

The only details are the two points of moonlight reflected in
the piercing animal-fierce eyes

The eyes are red

Like two candles Like two red traffic lights Like two drops
of blood Like the red eyes of a mouse

Like the red eyes of the shadow puppet from the bazaar
swooping down on the terrified man

Like the red earrings of the woman in the elevator -
MATRONLY LADY
It’s right in front of you and you
just cant see it can you

And back to those two glaring RED EYES in the present
patiently waiting in the dark just for him

He puts an arm out to protect Jessica sizing up a path to
the window - the round window overlooking the park where he
and Laura first met
MATRONLY LADY (CONT’D)

You just don’t get it It doesn’t

matter what you do
He makes a dash for it dragging Jessica with him
Frantically unlocking the window and helping through it out
into the night air
Smoke seeps under the door filling the bedroom

JESSICA
Come on

She is waiting for him

CHARLES
Go go I’m coming

He heaves himself onto the window ledge then turns He
realizes the two Red Eyes have not moved - because they
don’t have to

He can flee but it won’t end this thing

He looks into Jessica’s eyes - a smile of reassurance

CHARLES (CONTD)
Go on Don’t wait

So she sets off along the ledge and jumps down dissolving
into the night air

As she as she’s out of sight he drops back into the room to
face this thing

But it’s not there It’s has moved

He scours the room choking back the rising smoke And of
course the Black Figure is right next to him

Before he can react this thing grips at his throat SLAMMING
him back against the wall
He thrashes and flails but its strength is remorseless

These flaming red eyes bore into his gaze his brain
unleashing a torrent of moment-of-death flashbacks -

Fiery drawings Flames The incinerator

Circles - everywhere Ticking clocks dripping steering
wheels glasses bowls bottles All smashing

Fingers tracing circles “It’s all connected” “You’re not
looking”

HIS FISTS
pound against this dark mass

As he remembers turning from the round window the first time
they saw the house “We’ll take it”

His wife’s loving look
His elevator ride from hell -
MATRONLY WOMAN
The more you struggle the worse you

make it

Charles tries to throttle it back clutching futilely at its
huge black throat

And sure enough the more he struggles the worse it gets
His feet lift off the floor as the life is choked out of him
He kicks out wildly knocking over a chair

Just like when he put Naomi to bed

It’s no use He is choking to death

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Just like his daughter

INT NAOMI’S ROOM - NIGHT
The round window recedes - seemingly miles away now

Just like Naomi’s last glance in the mall elevator

He screams Just like Sonia in her death throes Just like
Naomi as she falls putting out her hands

And tries one last desperate act - digging his thumbs into
the burning red of these remorseless eyes

It’s like plunging his thumbs into molten lava
The whole room seems to react - inflammable solvents igniting

to unleash a blood-red fireball that engulfs the room The
thing unleashes a Jurassic wail of anger

Blood splutters into his mouth as he starts to lose
consciousness - his sinews stretched tight in his neck Still
he digs his thumbs deeper gouging at these fiery sockets
with all his might

Amid the roar of pain he gets a final glimpse of his own
face reflected in these remorseless red eyes before they seem
to extinguish -

And everything is devoured by the terrible billowing beauty
of total annihilation

INT JESSICA’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Jessica’s panting slows down

Her monitors drop and settle and her spasm subsides The
Medics are assuming her system has finally given out now

But Laura can tell otherwise by the grip of her daughter’s
hand

And her eyes - screwed tight against the pain - gradually
open

She takes in her surroundings and can’t believe it The pain
has stopped

She’s still alive and looking at her mother with genuine
recognition

FADE OUT

EXT STREET - DAY

A shifting abstract pattern of white slowly reveals itself to
be falling snowflakes

The city going about its business in the cold Haggling
Selling Drinking coffee Smoking Fishing off the bridge
The river flowing out to sea Cars honking in traffic

We pick out a figure who hurries along bundled up against
the cold

INT HALLWAY - DAY

It’s Dr Ayshe She makes her way to her office sorting her
mail sifting to find the right key

LAURA (OS)
Dr Ayshe

Dr Ayshe turns to the figure emerging from the shadows of
the stairwell

It’s Laura

INT DR AYSHES OFFICE - DAY

The familiar room and chair now occupied by an unfamiliar
guest - Laura

Dr Ayshe stirring her steaming tea waiting patiently
LAURA
I’m sorry I can’t switch off about

this I’ve got too many questions

DR AYSHE
That’s okay Go ahead

LAURA

The verdict at the inquest - I know
it was misadventure But the police
only said the boiler “may” have
caused the fire They weren’t 100
per cent sure

DR AYSHE
How could they be The place burnt
to ground They could equally have
said it was arson but they didn’t

She considers Laura sitting there playing with the rubber
band on her folder her mind clearly going round and round

DR AYSHE (CONTD)
Your husband didn’t commit suicide
if that’s what you’re thinking

No that’s not what she’s thinking

LAURA
No It’s just

How to say this without sounding crazy
LAURA (CONTD)
You know the night he died my

daughter made a full recovery

DR AYSHE
I know she survived

LAURA

She didn’t just survive She came
back from the dead in a matter of
minutes It was a miracle The
doctors still can’t explain it
You know my husband’s theories
about the house this spirit

Dr Ayshe nods already knowing where this is going

LAURA (CONTD)
How can you not think there’s any
connection

A longer pause this time Dr Ayshe doesn’t want to upset
her but at the same time

DR AYSHE
Well there was no evidence for
one thing The house was bulldozed
to the ground What was left of it
anyway You saw it yourself They
didn’t find anything but ashes

Ominously Laura produces a folder Just like her husband
she has conclusive “evidence”

LAURA
These are Jessica’s medical records
from the night Charles died If you
look her readings dropped -
literally plummeted - at exactly
the same time the neighbors
reported the fire to the police -

She hands copies to Dr Ayshe

LAURA (CONTD)
Not only that there was a tremor
reported The first one in 12
years You see -

Dr Ayshe politely looks over the evidence beginning to feel
trapped in her own loop than never ends

LAURA (CONTD)
How can that just be coincidence

Dr Ayshe takes a moment to find the right tone and approach
DR AYSHE
Are you familiar with the Thomas
Theorem It is the basis for all
self-fulfilling -
INT HOSPITAL - DAY

The final inferno as predicted by Jessica’s drawings

Laura studies her daughter’s notebook for the umpteenth
time we sense She is sitting in reception waiting

Jessica emerges with a Nurse helping her with her one bag
which she hands to Laura

Jessica still bears traces from her physical ordeal but is
otherwise recovered

JESSICA
Did you talk to Dr Ayshe

Laura nods

JESSICA (CONTD)
What did she say

LAURA
That he loved you very much

Jessica knows this isn’t the whole truth

JESSICA
What else did she say

Laura thinks about answering then decides otherwise

LAURA
Who cares what they think

She steers Jessica to the exit

EXT HOSPITAL - DAY

The pair emerge into crisp clean sunlight

After a few steps Jessica takes her mother’s hand

Two increasingly small dots rejoining the throng of the city

and it’s shimmering jostling skyline beyond

THE END
