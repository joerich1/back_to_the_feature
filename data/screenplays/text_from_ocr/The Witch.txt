TO THE READER

This is a tale of witchcraft told as a simple family of
seventeenth century New England might have believed it to be All
of their folkloric and religious beliefs in this film are true
It was inspired by various folktales fairytales and recorded
accounts (journals diaries court records etc) of historical
witches and possessions from New England and Western Europe before
the Salem outbreak in 1692 Much of the dialogue in fact comes
directly from those sources

In order to effectively depict this world in which ordinary people
understood supernatural occurrences to be an expected part of
life it is essential that all aspects of the film to be carried
out with utter naturalism The characters must appear as real
farmers not actors with dirty faces Even the supernatural
elements must be photographed as realistically as possible Yet
with all this authenticity and “realism it is still a folktale
a dream A nightmare from the past

with painted faces and A ROUGH LOOKING WHITE MAN stand near
by with their goods

THOMASIN CALEB THE TWINS and FOWLER THE DOG watch the

two-wheeled CART

WILLIAM walks alongside the workhorse pulling a cart strapped
with a trunk a chair clinking pots and pans and few other
miscellaneous articles Surely not enough to survive on

KATHERINE takes his hand THE FAMILY is in a circle on
their knees in joyful silent prayer Their faces beaming

Before them is a BEAUTIFUL IDYLLIC NATURAL CLEARING OF
ROLLING HILLS

ANCIENT WOOD ITS ENORMOUS PINES STAND LIKE GIANTS ABOVE THE
FAMILY

EXT THE SAME CLEARING - DAWN - NOVEMBER

It is now late autumn Anorexic CORNSTALKS are scattered
across a muddy field

A FLEDGLING FARM sits on top of a hill at the foot of THE
WOOD MONSTROUS TREES loom over THE RAMSHACKLE COTTAGE Its
crooked clapboards to are beginning to grey and the gabled
thatch to brown Behind the house are a few shoddy structures
and scrap-wood fences for keeping in the small amount of
livestock The frame of the INCOMPLETE BARN looks as if it
will collapse at any moment Tools and raw lumber littler
the yard

INT FARMHOUSE - MORNING

CLOSE ON THOMASIN Her large blue eyes gaze earnestly
toward heaven Her chin rests on little dirty fingers She
says her words with surprising acceptance

THOMASIN
O most merciful father I here
confess I have lived in sin
I have been idle of my work
disobedient of mine parents
neglectful of my prayer I have in
secret played upon thy sabbath and
broken every one of thy
commandments in thought followed
the desires of my own will and not
the holy Spirit I know I deserve
all shame and misery in this life
and everlasting hell-fire But I
beg thee for the sake of thy Son
Forgive me Show me mercy Show
me thy light

I thank thee that thou hast
defended me this night and brought
me safe unto this day These and
all other graces I beg at thy
hands in that prayer which Christ
himself hath taught me

SLIGHTLY as if something had just run through it

EXT THE WOOD - NIGHTFALL

The autumn mist is thick Boney-fingered branches crack in
the wind

A SMALL HUNCHED FIGURE in a tattered RED CLOAK hobbles
quickly through the enormous mossy trees

A distorted old breath comes from under THE RED HOOD
wheezing trying to keep pace From a little lower in the
cloak comes the sound of a gargling BABY One of SAMUELS
HANDS pokes out

Dusk is at its end

INT THE WITCH’S HOVEL - NIGHT
DARKNESS It is almost impossible to see

Passing through the shadows extremely old and bent HANDS
with long dirty talons briefly catch the firelight They
place SAMUEL upon the center of a crude table Overwhelmed by
the dark he senses the danger His delicate baby FINGERS
open and close reflexively grasping at the air

Seen in flickering glimpses the greasy RED CLOAK falls to
the dirt floor TINY FEET step around THE CLOAK and kick off
square-toed shoes Jagged fungal toe-nails poke out of
soiled wool stockings

THE OLD HANDS grab the BABY’S COLLAR tear open his linen
shift and strip it off the child SAMUEL starts to cry

THE FIGURE steps away from the table her back to camera
Hobbling in and out of blackness of the hovel she takes off
her bonnet and scanty grey locks fall to her shoulders
snaking across her bent spine She removes the rest of her
filthy clothes and for an instant HER NAKED BODY is
revealed before she moves back into shadow

HER HANDS reach up to the low THATCH CEILING over THE BABY
and tear out a mossy clump Little bits of dirt and reed and
other natural scantlings fall on SAMUEL BRIGHT MOONLIGHT
shines through the hole bathing the child in its light

OFF SCREEN THE OLD WOMAN hums a haunting song Her HANDS
stroke the baby tenderly and pinches the fatty areas around
his thighs and biceps

Her HAND take a LARGE RUSTY KNIFE she holds it up over the
child’s breast she continues to hum her song

CAMERA ON The humpback and scabby head of THE OLD WOMAN
She brings the knife up and then down in a swift motion
(WE DO NOT SEE THE BABY only the back of THE OLD WOMAN)

AUDIO CHOP THE BABY WAILS
— LATER

Back to camera THE OLD WOMAN’S SILHOUETTE sits by a low-
burning fire

She grinds at her MORTAR AND PESTLE One can easily assume
its contents

Scattered beside her are a messy assortment of EARTHEN JARS
Each jar emits a more awful stench than the other

- LATER

THE FIRE IS OUT

Illuminated in the dimmest traces of moonlight THE OLD WOMAN
has A THICK BLOODY GREASE in her hands She rubs this UNGUENT
all over her NAKED BODY

- MOMENTS LATER

She rubs THE UNGUENT on THE WOODEN HANDLE OF A BROOMSITCK It
foams around her thumb and forefinger

- MOMENTS LATER

CAMERA ON HER BACK Barely visible THE NAKED OLD WOMAN
stands near the hearth

She mounts THE BROOM
She is still

Suddenly her head moves First a jerk then it slows Her
gaze going upward

Her eyes roll to the back of her head and her eyelids flutter
in and out of the moonlight Her face remains unseen

SHE TREMBLES AND COLLAPSES TO THE GROUND

SHE BREATHES HEAVILY AND RHYTHMICALLY GROANING AND GROANING
TREMORING IN THE DIRT AND DARKNESS

SHE GRIPS THE BROOMSTICK FIRMLY

EXT THE WITCH’S HOVEL - NIGHT

LOW WIDE Shadowed by a confusion of twisted branches THE
WITCH RISES AWAY FROM CAMERA - SLOWLY WEIRDLY PHANTOM-LIKE
— THROUGH THE THATCH SMOKE-HOLE OF HER ROOF ASCENDING INTO

THE NIGHT TOWARD THE MOON

Her naked body scrapes against the branches clicking
clacking and cracking as she rises “Clickety-clackety
clickety-clackety clickety-clackety”

BLACK HOLD

AUDIO A rooster crows Other quite farm noises

INT FARMHOUSE GARRET - DAWN
A WOODEN SHUTTER is unlatched from a small glass-less window
A WOMANS MUFFLED CRYING AND MUMBLING IS HEARD

Dim dawn light hits CALEB’S gaunt freckled face His light
eyes are full of worries Painfully anxious

The dawn glows red

CALEB picks up his homespun doublet He stumbles quietly over
and through the pile of sleeping SWEATY-FACED SIBLINGS and
straw mattresses on the floor Dwindling food stores hang
from the pitched ceiling almost knocking his head

MERCY is curled up with JONAS who sucks his thumb

THOMASIN has JONAS’ DIRTY FEET near her FACE

As CALEB takes a big step THOMASIN moves in her sleep

CALEB looks down and notices THE SIDE OF HIS SISTERS BREAST
in her somewhat open shift and her faint armpit hair

Pause

Embarrassed CALEB looks away
THOMASIN moves again Blankets rustle
CALEB look back

THOMASIN’S face is contorted in pain Her eyes twitch under
her eyelids SHE IS HAVING A NIGHTMARE

CALEB hesitates He kneels down and gently shakes her
shoulders

CALEB
(whispers almost
inaudible)
Thomasin

CALEB shakes her again
CALEB (CONTD)
(whispered)
Thomasin

THOMASIN’S EYES OPEN and she gasps clenching her fists

CALEB puts his hand gently over her mouth She jerks
disoriented

CALEB pantomimes a “shh” with his other hand They pause

THEY LISTEN TO THEIR MOTHER’S WEEPING AND PRAYING from
downstairs

CALEB uncovers THOMASIN’S mouth She looks at him
Pause

THOMASIN’S face is as mournful as their mother’s weeping Her
eyes beg for comfort

CALEB (CONTD)
(whispers almost
inaudible)
Sleep All will be well Sleep

CALEB keeps his eyes on his sister till she reluctantly lies
back in bed

Then he climbs down the rickety ladder to

INT FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

- the ground floor of the family’s extremely primitive one-
room home The stench of squalor and smoke hangs in the air

FOWLER THE DOG is near an EMPTY WOODEN CRADLE He is up too

CALEB steps over his parent’s chamber pot and pushes a
wandering HEN away from his shoes that are near his parent’s
bedside

He can still hear his MOTHER crying softly from behind the
shabby bed curtains THE DOG whines and tries to peek in
CALEB turns his head to the door and puts on his doublet

THE FRONT DOOR is half open

EXT THE FARM -— CONTINUOUS

CALEB walks out the door past a TALL PILE OF STACKED
FIREWOOD past the chopping block and AXE

EXT THE FARMCORNFIELD - CONTINUOUS

He continues toward THE SILHOUETTED FIGURE at the bottom
of the hill in the CORNFIELD It’s WILLIAM

CALEB approaches tentatively
He gently touches WILLIAM’S shoulder
He is startled and turns

He sees his son out of the corner of his eye peeking through
his long thinning hair HE TURNS AWAY

His smoky voice rumbles

WILLIAM
Caleb

CALEB tries to initiate contact

CALEB
God give you good morrow

(Pause )
WILLIAM frowns biting on a his mustache and beard
His coarse hand holds an EAR OF INDIAN CORN His wide-brimmed
hat is in the other THE CORN IS SHRIVELED HALF GROWN AND
ROTTING A DISGUSTING MALIGNANT FUNGUS is bursting between
its kernels

CHICKENS cluck several yards away

CALEB (CONTD)
All are still a-bed

(Pause )
Save Mother
WILLIAM

No ease to rise on a grey day The
Devil holds fast your eyelids

CALEB
Ill wake ‘em

WILLIAM
Let ‘em be
CALEB looks surprised
WILLIAM (CONTD)
Thy mother’s not slept a night
since
WILLIAM looks at the ground
WILLIAM (CONTD)
We can search no longer Caleb We
cannot If not a wolf hunger’d
have taken him yet

Pause

WILLIAM looks at the devastated cornfield Disfigured corpses
of infected corn-ears lay upon the grey soil

WILLIAM THROWS THE EAR OF CORN HE HAS BEEN HOLDING WITH ALL
HIS MIGHT It disappears into the hazy dawn

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Let’s to The Wood

CALEB looks very surprised

WILLIAM (CONTD)
I’ve been a-laying traps for some
while - before even this new
misery

CALEB
Within The Wood

WILLIAM
Will you not help thy father

CALEB
You and mother have always forbad
us to set foot there

WILLIAM
This is our home now Fear it not
Eh Did not we build our house of
timbers

(Pause )
We must conquer this wood It will
not consume us

Pause

CALEB
Perchance you snared that wolf

WILLIAM
Aye Fetch thy hat tis bitter
cold

WILLIAM smiles hopefully at CALEB again and touches his bare
head

CALEB smiles back and runs toward the house
WILLIAM (CONTD)
And the gun
EXT THE EDGE OF THE WOOD - EARLY MORNING
WILLIAM is only a small speck beneath the THREATENING TREES
The thick trunks moan and creak swaying ever so slightly in

the wind

He walks quietly into the darkness of THE WOOD

CALEB stands still several paces back with FOWLER THE DOG
HE HOLDS HIS FATHER’S MUSKET

CALEB looks up at the high treetops afraid to enter

FOWLER whimpers a little

WILLIAM calls from within

WILLIAM (0S)
Caleb

Caleb catches up and crosses THE FORBIDDEN THRESHOLD

EXT THE WOOD - EARLY MORNING

Father and son walk in the early morning mist FOWLER by
their side

Their wooden powder flasks clink and clatter against their
bony chests

Grey leaves crunch beneath their feet

A dense pine canopy bristles above them shadowing the forest
floor CALEB’S LESSON echoes through the trees

WILLIAM
Art thou then born holy and
righteous

CALEB
No nay My first father sinned and
I in him

CALEB wants to be serious however with all the danger and
excitement a small but uncontrollable grin has appeared on
his face He recites with pride

WILLIAM
Art thou then born a sinner

CALEB
Aye I was conceived in sin and
born in - iniquity

WILLIAM
Good Then what is thy birth sin

CALEB
Adams sin imputed to me anda
corrupt nature dwelling within me

WILLIAM
Well-remembered Caleb Very well
And canst thou tell me what thy
corrupt nature is

CALEB

My corrupt nature is empty of
grace bent unto sin only unto
sin and that continually

CALEB pauses for a moment THE WORDS OF HIS CATECHISM SINKING
IN

WILLIAM
Soft now

They come upon a LARGE OVERTURNED TREE Its sprawling root
system is far taller than WILLIAM

LEB watches WILLIAM find a TRAP he had laid near it

LLIAM kicks THE TRAP softly with the toe of his boot

IS SHUT THERE IS NO CATCH

LLIAM hides his disappointment

WILLIAM (CONTD)
We must lay’t again
CALEB goes to the trap He stops himself from touching the
big iron teeth He looks imploringly at his father May I set
it

WILLIAM nods and smiles affirmatively

CALEB bends down to open the jaws He struggles a bit
WILLIAM (CONTD)
Now mind thy hand Caleb Mind thy
hand
CALEB slows his work thinking again

CALEB
Was was Samuel born a sinner

WILLIAM pauses

He nods “yes”

CALEB was expecting that answer

CALEB (CONTD)
How might then -

WILLIAM
(overlapping)
We pray he hath entered God’s
Kingdom

Pause

CALEB
What wickedness hath he done

WILLIAM
Place faith in God - Caleb mind

(Pause )

We’ll speak no more on thy brother

CALEB

and who is not Who is good and who

Fain would I tell thee Sam sleeps
in Jesus that thou wilt that I
will but I cannot tell thee that
None can

CALEB looks down and starts fiddling with the trap again

CALEB
But you and Mother You have made
covenant You have a place in
Heaven

WILLIAM
I keep an unfeigned grief for the
want of grace I can do no more

(Long pause)
Caleb
CALEB keeps his eyes on the trap

CALEB
Where are these from

WILLIAM
Caleb list me

CALEB
I do

WILLIAM
From Indian Thom and Old Slater
when last they passed through Move

CALEB

Very long pause

WILLIAM
Thy mother’s silver cup

It is clear from CALEB’S face that this was not something to
be traded

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Let’s recover the rest

Cautious

Behind her MERCY rides JONAS like a horse JONAS makes GOAT
NOISES

THOMASIN stands in front of her parents’ bed The curtains

holes in the curtains

KATHERINE lies on the bed her hands clenched together her
eyes closed She whispers an inaudible prayer

A sadder face has never been seen

EXT FARMYARD - LATER

CLOSE ON THOMASIN still affected by the sight of her
mother

She carries a heavy pail of water on her head bracing it
with one hand She can’t hold it up very well and the ground
is muddy and upturned With every step across the farmyard
water sloshes out of the bucket on to her shoulders soaking
her She shudders with frustration

She puts the bucket down for a moment to wipe her cold nose
She picks it up again and keeps walking She’s used to it
but today it is too much

WILLIAM gives CALEB a look instructing him to be quiet

WILLIAM barks at FOWLER

WILLIAM (CONTD)

FOWLER runs after THE HARE

He chases it in a wide circle around the clearing Both
running hard as they can

CALEB hands his father the heavy MUSKET
WILLIAM (CONTD)

Praise God Look at the size Make

Rushing WILLIAM spills powder all over the barrel of the

gun

THE HARE STOPS RUNNING It breathes softly

FOWLER is panting

THEN THE HARE TURNS TOWARD WILLIAM AND CALEB AND STARES

IT STANDS THERE NOT MOVING GAZING WITH ITS HYPNOTIC AMBER
EYES

FOWLER barks at THE STRANGE HARE

CALEB can’t believe the sight

WILLIAM’S finger shakes

IT STARES RIGHT AT WILLIAM AND CALEB AS IF IT WERE ENCHANTED

FOWLER keeps barking ferociously
CALEB watches intently

THE MATCH CORD is burning steady

We are ye servants

Black Phillip eats the lions
From the lions’ den

WILLIAM
How now you two Stop this
mischief

WILLIAM runs in front of THE BILLY GOAT and CALEB pulls THE
TWINS aside

Poultry flies wild
THE GOAT runs toward WILLIAM

WILLIAM tries to grab its back legs He misses nearly
falling down

THE GOAT flies by chasing the chickens into THE HOUSE
KATHERINE runs out of the house the GOAT heading toward her
KATHERINE shrieks

She runs to THE CHILDREN

WILLIAM AND THE GOAT run into THE HOUSE A clatter is heard

WILLIAM THE GOAT AND SEVERAL CHICKENS BURST OUT OF THE
FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Ope’ the gate Caleb Ope’ the gate

CALEB opens the gate KATHERINE immediately grabs his arm
tearing him out of the way She holds him and THE TWINS close
to her

WILLIAM drives THE GOAT in to his stall by his legs THE GOAT
KICKS

WILLIAM SLIPS AND FALLS IN A BIG PILE OF DUNG

CALEB AND THE WHOLE FAMILY LOOKS AT HIM

THE BILLY GOAT is calm He eats some fodder near WILLIAM
Chickens cluck

JONAS and MERCY laugh

WILLIAM (CONTD)
I’1l have thee quiet

CALEB watches his father get up

WILLIAM looks at his wife Her eyes are cloudy from lack of
sleep She holds CALEB tightly She’s not laughing

KATHERINE
Whither were you and Caleb this
morn
WILLIAM rises to go towards her tenderly
She steps back and turns away from her husband

She calls

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Thomasin

WILLIAM goes toward her again

WILLIAM
Kate

KATHERINE
(overlapping)
Thomasin Thomasin

THOMASIN comes running to the farmyard out of breath

KATHERINE (CONTD)
(To William)
How could you disappear
(To Thomasin)
(MORE)

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
And thee I told thee to keep watch
of Jonas and Mercy

THOMASIN
I was and I bade them help me and
they paid me no mind I was a-
getting -

Beside her JONAS is pulling on MERCY’S cheek MERCY tries not
to laugh

WILLIAM
(overlapping calmly)
Stop that

KATHERINE
(to Thomasin)
What’s the matter with thee
Thomasin What’s the matter with
thee

Take thy father’s rags to the brook
and wash em

WILLIAM
Tis only dung
THOMASIN
They would pay me no mind -
KATHERINE
(overlapping)
And brush out his woolens Help

him
THOMASIN is shut down

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
(to Caleb)
My lamb

KATHERINE kisses CALEB’S head

CALEB WATCHES THOMASIN as she helps her father take off his
soiled clothing THERE IS SOMETHING TOO FAMILIAR IN THE WAY
THOMASIN TOUCHES HER FATHER’S BODY AS SHE UNDRESSES HIM IT
IS INNOCENT - IT IS SUBTLE - BUT SHE IS TOO OLD FOR IT

KATHERINE SEES IT TOO

She keeps with the problem at hand

KATHERINE (CONTD)
It gave me such a fright to find
thee gone

(to William)
Ill not be left here alone Dost
hear The morning’s work is well
behindhand Where were you

Meanwhile JONAS continues to pull at his sister’s cheek
With every tug MERCY’S eyes widen and he holds back laughter

MERCY can’t take it she lets out a scream followed by a
tearful giggle

WILLIAM
Jonas Leave thy sister be
JONAS
She likes it
KATHERINE
William
WILLIAM

Cannot a father spend Godly time
with his son

JONAS gives another tug on MERCY’S cheek and she screams
again

WILLIAM (CONT’D)
Jonas

THOMASIN

WILLIAM and KATHERINE
Thomasin

MERCY laughs

JONAS
She likes it

MERCY keeps laughing

JONAS (CONT’D)
See

THOMASIN
Stop it

WILLIAM
Stop it each of you Stop it

KATHERINE
As you like

KATHERINE turns cold and walks toward the house

WILLIAM is stuck He cannot tell her

CALEB looks at his father’s sad face
SUDDENLY CALEB calls out to his mother

CALEB
We went to find apples

(Pause )
WILLIAMS face goes white

CALEB (CONTD)
In the valley I had thought I had
seen an apple tree in the valley
Father brought the gun for if we
glanced that wolf again-

KATHERINE
(overlapping)
Why did you not tell me

CALEB
Father wanted it a surprise to
cheer you and so but there
were none I thought I had seen
them

KATHERINE looks at CALEB and WILLIAM She clearly doubts this
story

Pause
CALEB looks imploringly at her
She smiles hesitantly and she concedes barely
KATHERINE
I like you not outside the farm

Even to the valley Dost hear me

CALEB nods “yes”

WILLIAM
Caleb
(pause )
Be a good lad and fetch some water
for Mother Stray not from the

brook

CALEB looks knowingly at his father and runs away

EXT FARM CHOPPING-BLOCK - LATER

AN AXE HEAD splits a LOG

WILLIAM chops wood furiously He is half dressed with a linen
sheet wrapped round his waist like a skirt

Chop
CHOP

CHOP

EXT STREAM NEAR THE WOOD - AFTERNOON

The long dead tendrils of a WILLOW TREE hang around THOMASIN
She wades in a small stream scrubbing her father’s shirt and
breeches against some rocks quietly humming a psalm

CALEB is nearby filling buckets with water WATCHING HIS
SISTER

THOMASIN’S apron and petticoat are tucked into her belt
EXPOSING HER BARE LEGS in the water

CALEB WATCHES HER LEGS

AND HER SMALL CHEST RISING UP AND DOWN AT THE TOP OF HER
BODICE

THOMASIN shivers a bit in the cold water as she scrubs

CALEB holds the wooden bucket still in the stream and watches
her work

THOMASIN LOOKS UP AND CATCHES HIS GAZE

CALEB gasps silently and looks to his chores

THOMASIN
Why are you dallying
CALEB keeps his eyes on the bucket

THOMASIN (CONTD)
What then

CALEB slows his work again but keeps looking down

THOMASIN (CONTD)
What

THOMASIN splashes him with water

THOMASIN (CONTD)
Caleb

THOMASIN splashes him again

THOMASIN (CONTD)
Caleb

Big splash
CALEB looks up hurt and ashamed

CALEB
Stop it

THOMASIN
I meant no harm in it

CALEB turns to go

THOMASIN (CONTD)
Caleb I meant no harm What’s the
matter with thee Come hither
What’s the matter

CALEB goes to THOMASIN and she takes him in her arms

THOMASIN (CONT’D)
What’s the matter with thee Shhh

CALEBS eyes well-up with tears THOMASIN strokes CALEB’S
hair as he nestles up to her

THOMASIN (CONTD)
I have seen no apple since we went
from England I would thou hadst
found em I so wish for one

THOMASIN MIMES BITING CALEB’S SHOULDER AND MAKES A

GROWLINGGNAWING SOUND
They laugh a little though CALEB tries not to

THOMASIN starts humming her psalm again almost rocking
CALEB

They stay for a long time in this innocently incestuous
embrace

For once all is calm

Suddenly they hear something move in the tall grass and
bulrushes

It’s the crackle and snap of many branches (It sounds very
like the sound THE WITCH made when she ascended into the air
in the beginning of the film)

CALEB guiltily jumps out of THOMASIN’S arms

CALEB
Hear that

THOMASIN
Aye

The “clickety-clackety” sound again

CALEB
Who’s there

Long Pause
A child voice speaks pretending to be old and scratchy

MERCY (0S)
I be The Witch of the Wood

THOMASIN
Mercy come out

MERCY (0S)
I be not Mercy I be The Witch of
the Wood I have come to steal ye
Hear me stick a-flying through the
trees clickety-clackety-clickety-
clakety

CALEB
Mercy

THOMASIN
Show thyself

MERCY runs through the bulrushes

MERCY
Clickety-clackety-clickety-clakety

THOMASIN
Why is’t when thou dost a wrong I
am a-washing Father’s clothes like
a slave and thou art playing idle

MERCY comes out holding a long stick

MERCY
Because Mother hates you

THOMASIN
Spoilt child I’11 tell Mother you
have left the farm alone

MERCY
Black Phillip saith I can do what I
like
THOMASIN
Devil take your Black Phillip
MERCY
It’s your fault I cannot leave the
yard
THOMASIN
Quiet thee
MERCY

I could go to the brook before you
let The Witch take Sam

CALEB
It was a wolf stole Sam

MERCY
A witch I’ve seen her in her
riding cloak about The Wood

CALEB
Father showed me the tracks

MERCY
It was a witch

THOMASIN
Aye It was a witch Mercy You
speak aright

CALEB
Thomasin

THOMASIN
It was I

MERCY
Liar

THOMASIN

Twas I what stole him I’m the
witch of the wood

MERCY
Liar Liar

THOMASIN
I am

THOMASIN smiles the smile of an older sister who know’s her
fib is working And she’s not going to stop

CALEB
List not to her Mercy

THOMASIN
I am that very witch When I sleep
my spirit slips away from my body
and dances naked with The Devil
That’s how I signed his book

MERCY
No

THOMASIN grows more serious in her play

THOMASIN
He bade me bring him an unbaptized
babe and I stole Sam and I gave
him to my master And Ill make any
man or thing else vanish I like

MERCY
No

THOMASIN
Aye And Ill vanish thee too if
thou displeaseth me

MERCY
Be quiet

CALEB
Mercy she’s but telling fantasies

THOMASIN
Or perchance I’1l1 boil and bake
thee since we are lack of food

MERCY
Stop

CALEB
Stop Thomasin

MERCY starts crying

MERCY
It’s not true

THOMASIN seems very serious now

THOMASIN
It is thou thing How I crave to
sink my teeth into thy pink flesh

MERCY
I’m not afraid of thee

THOMASIN
I’1l make thee afraid before I have
done with thee

MERCY starts to run THOMASIN runs after her and grabs her
arm

MERCY
Let me go Let me go I am not
afraid for God hath kept me and
will keep me still

THOMASIN
If ever thou tellst thy mother of
this I will witch thee and thy
mother And Jonas too

MERCY
Caleb

MERCY cries and runs again THOMASIN stops her she pins
MERCY down to the ground THOMASIN SLAPS HER FACE
THOMASIN
Stop thy tears and swear thy
silence

MERCY
I swear it

THOMASIN
You will not tell Mother nor
Father

MERCY
I swear

CALEB

Thomasin let her alone
MERCY gets up

MERCY

Get away from her Caleb or she’1l

witch thee
MERCY runs away

CALEB looks at THOMASIN

CALEB
Why tell Mercy those horrible
fancies

THOMASIN

Dost thou hate me too

CALEB
It was a wolf stole Sam

THOMASIN
I know

She holds back her tears
THOMASIN (CONTD)
Leave me be Go tell Mother and
Father of my wickedness

CALEB walks toward her

THOMASIN (CONTD)
Dost hear me

CALEB
Thomaisn I-

THOMASIN
Leave

CALEB

THOMASIN
I hate thy pity I need it not

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

WILLIAMS eyes are closed With open arms his hands reach

above his head and up to Heaven His words are not

rhetorical They are in earnest

WILLIAM
and forgive us the sins we have
this day committed against thee

EVERYONE is at the table in prayer

Food is very scant

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Free us from the shame and torment
which are due unto us for them We
beseech thee increase our faith in
the promises of the gospel our
fear of thy name and the hatred of
all our sins that we may be
assured that thy Holy Spirit dwells
in us that we might be thy
children in thy love and mercy

For as we hunger for this food of
our bodies so our souls hunger for
the food of eternal life Finish
soon our days of sin and bring us
to everlasting peace through the
purifying blood of thy son our
Lord and only Saviour Christ Jesus

ALL
Amen

WILLIAM puts his arms down

CALEB looks at his father WILLIAM keeps his eyes to his

food

THOMASIN looks at Mercy MERCY looks away with fear
KATHERINE
Thomasin where hast thou put the
silver cup

CALEB looks up from his meal

THOMASIN
Is’t not on the shelf

KATHERINE
Nay

THOMASIN

In the six board then

KATHERINE
T’aint there neither It has been
disappeared for some while

(pause )
Didst lose it

THOMASIN
I haven’t touched it

KATHERINE
Where has it gone then

THOMASIN
I haven’t touched it

KATHERINE
I have caught thee trifling with it
before

WILLIAM
She sayth she haven’t touched it
Katherine

KATHERINE
How thou couldst lose my father’s
silver wine cup in this hovel I
cannot know

THOMASIN
I have no-

KATHERINE
(overlapping)
Peace child it is gone Did a wolf
vanish that too

THOMASIN’S stomach sinks

CALEB looks at his father

WILLIAM keeps his gaze down on his own dinner
The tension is VERY palpable
Sounds of the crackling fire fill the silence

WILLIAM
She haven’t touched it Katherine

WILLIAM takes another bite of food and wipes his beard Eyes
on his plate

Pause

KATHERINE
What is amiss on this farm

KATHERINE looks down

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
It is not natural

JONAS and MERCY look back at THOMASIN with accusatory eyes

WILLIAM
Caleb

CALEB look at his father nervously Will he make him
confess

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Will you read out the chapter of
The Word to-night
CALEB nods “yes” relieved
WILLIAM (CONTD)
We must find some light in our
darkness To-morrow we will have a
fast day but for our sins
Everyone is silent

From outside A GOAT BLEATS

KATHERINE
Thomasin

Another bleat Louder

KATHERINE (CONTD)
Didst not bed them down before
supper Thomasin

EXT FARMYARD - NIGHT

Another bleat even wilder The frightening sound echoes in
the night

THOMASIN walks alone with a lantern to THE GOAT SHED Her
cloak has been hastily thrown on

The darkness of the farmyard is heavy on her
She can faintly hear CALEB reading from The Bible
As she walks something moves in the trees

She turns her head to the treetops and hears the “clickety-
clackety”

Pause

Her breath quickens

She walks closer cautiously slowly

A terrible screeching and grunting coming from the GOAT SHED
She walks closer to the open door she holds up her lamp

INSIDE BLACK PHILLIP IS VIOLENTLY COPULATING WITH ONE OF THE

NANNY GOATS THE NANNY GOAT screams as she tries to pull away
from him He keeps her in the grasp of his strong legs and
muddy hooves BLACK PHILLIP keeps grunting and thrusting

THOMASIN gasps She doesn’t look away

INT FARMHOUSE CANOPY BED - NIGHT
WILLIAM is in bed staring wide eyed at the wall

The bed curtains are open and KATHERINE is kneeling on the
floor praying by candlelight

WILLIAM
Love put out the light

KATHERINE keeps praying

WILLIAM (CONTD)
You must sleep tonight Kate
KATHERINE finishes her parer and gets into bed
WILLIAM puts his arm around KATHERINE

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Thou dost remember I love thee

She KISSES his large farmer’s HAND

KATHERINE
I do

WILLIAM
List me Kate I fear thou lookst
too much upon this affliction We
must bend our thoughts towards God
not ourselves

(pause )
He hath never taken a child from
us Never a one Kate Who might
earn that grace We have been
ungrateful of God’s love

KATHERINE embraces her husband and buries her face in
chest WILLIAM comforts her the best he can

KATHERINE
He hath cursed this family

WILLIAM
No He hath taken us into a very
low condition to humble us and to
show us more of his grace

Still in his embrace KATHERINE turns away

KATHERINE
Was not Christ was led into the
wilderness to be ill met by the
devil

WILLIAM
KATHERINE

We should ne’er have left the
plantation

WILLIAM

KATHERINE

There is naught hither

WILLIAM

KATHERINE
How dare you chide me on a cup Tis
not for vanity that I am grieved of
it

KATHERINE closes the bed drapes

INT FARMHOUSE GARRET - CONTINUOUS

CALEB and THOMASIN are awake sitting around a burning
candle

JONAS and MERCY are tucked in to their bed awake too

They all listen intently to every word of their parents’
whispers

KATHERINE (0S)
(whispering)
She’s old enough she needs must
leave to serve another family

THOMASIN is stunned

WILLIAM (0S)
Nay I must have each our hands -

KATHERINE (0S)
And each our empty stomachs too

THOMASIN’S face sinks CALEB want to look at her but he
doesn’t

WILLIAM (0S)
Twas not her fault I must tell

She is crying into in her pillow

HOLD ON CALEB

INT HORSE BARN - PRE-DAWN
CALEB by candlelight unties THE HORSE’S REINS from a post
THOMASIN (whispering)

Caleb Caleb

He turns and sees THOMASIN walking around the farmyard She
sees him

THOMASIN comes into the barn and quickly hides from the view
of the farmhouse

CALEB drops the reins and scrambles away from THE HORSE

THOMASIN (CONT’D)
What are you doing

He’s caught He won’t look at her

CALEB
Go to sleep

THOMASIN
What’s this Tell me now

CALEB

THOMASIN sees that BURT THE HORSE has his work-saddle and
bridle on

THOMASIN
Running away then

CALEB
No

THOMASIN
Lie not to me

CALEB
I don’t

THOMASIN
Then what

CALEB

THOMASIN
Tell me I’11 wake mother and
father

CALEB ignores her

THOMASIN (CONT’D)
As you like

THOMASIN starts to head toward the house
CALEB gets scared that she’s not bluffing

CALEB
If thou wilt back to sleep and
keep silent of this I promise
thee you’ll need not leave to
serve the Tildens nor any family

else
THOMASIN
Caleb -
CALEB
(overlapping)

Tis not pity for thee so chide me
not I’1l1 be back by mid-day

CALEB goes over to the horse

THOMASIN
Let me along with you

CALEB
I cannot

THOMASIN gives him a look that she is not to be trifled with

EXT THE WOOD - EARLY MORNING
The Wood is still dark

THOMASIN rides BURT CALEB is on foot holding the reins and
leading the way with his flickering lantern

FOWLER trots along beside them

CALEB has the musket The match-cord is lit

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - MORNING

CALEB finds one of THE TRAPS by THE LARGE OVERTURNED TREE He
bends down

THOMASIN
Well

CALEB turns to her with a smile They’ve made a catch

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - DAY

CALEB and THOMASIN move now with a swifter more assured
pace

A muskrat and other small game hang from the horse’s tack

Their spirits are light

THOMASIN
Aye but we did

CALEB
Nay

THOMASIN
We did

CALEB
No

THOMASIN

We had glass windows in England We
have not been hither so long that
you can forget that

CALEB
As you like Thomasin

THOMASIN
You’ve gone mad

CALEB

THOMASIN
We did

CALEB

THOMASIN
Dost not remember Fowler laying on
the floor i’the sun You must And
the curious-curled shadows upon his
back

CALEB
Nay

THOMASIN
You do And where the sun would
shine would he warm himself(to
Fowler) Wouldn’t you thou idler

Remember once he lay upon the
table and Father saw him and he
saith “we will have him for meat
Kate Kate We will roast this
beast”(she laughs) You must
remember that

CALEB
I remember that day but no glass

Pause

THOMASIN
Well

THOMASIN is very frustrated that Caleb cannot remember and
finds herself surprisingly emotional about this window

THOMASIN (CONT’D)
-it was pretty

Suddenly FOWLER starts tracking something

CALEB
What is’t boy

FOWLER POINTS

CALEB and THOMASIN look ahead

Standing about fifty yards before them is same giant HARE
from yesterday

BURT IS SPOOKED He neighs and clomps around kicking up dirt
and tossing his head up oddly THOMASIN holds tight to the
work saddle CALEB tries to keep his footing

CALEB (CONTD)
Burt calm thee

THOMASIN pats BURT to calm him and CALEB gives her the reins
THE HARE stays motionless looking straight at CALEB

CALEB carefully prepares the musket

He takes aim He shouts

CALEB (CONTD)
Fowler thence

FOWLER RUNS toward THE HARE barking loudly

BURT neighs again going rampant nearly knocking THOMASIN
off

THOMASIN
Burt

THE HARE RUNS DEEP INTO THE WOOD
FOWLER FOLLOWS HIM AND DISAPPEARS

CALEB
Fowler Nay Fowler

CALEB RUNS AFTER FOWLER
HE SHOUTS BACK TO THOMASIN AS HE RUNS

CALEB (CONTD)
Stand here with Burt

BURT IS STILL ACTING FRANTIC

THOMASIN
Caleb he’s gone mad

CALEB
(overlapping)
I’1l straight back

BUT IT IS TOO LATE

THE HORSE REARS AND BUCKS AGAIN KNOCKING THOMASIN TO THE
GROUND AND GALLOPS OFF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF FOWLER

THUD

THOMASIN IS LEFT UNCONSCIOUS ON THE FOREST FLOOR

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - LATER

CALEB travels deeper into The Wood running

THE TREES have become more indiscernible from one another
Tall seemingly identical trunks stand looming in every

direction He stops panting He turns around

CALEB
Thomasin Thomasin

He hears nothing

He tries to whistle for Fowler like his father does It comes
out airy and quiet

CALEB (CONTD)
Folwer

He attempts to whistle again It doesnt work

EXT FARM YARD - LATER

JONAS AND MERCY are tethered to a long rope tied to the fence
so they cannot wander from the farm THE GOAT-BELLS from the
nanny goats have also been tied to them

TWINS
Caleb Caleb

THE BELLS CLANK as they walk

KATHERINE and WILLIAM are in the distant fields near THE WOOD
searching calling their childrens names

A light rain starts to fall It plinks on the GOAT-BELLS
KATHERINE and WILLIAM
(in the distance)
Caleb lad Thomasin

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - AFTERNOON

THOMASIN wakes

THOMASIN
Caleb
SHE stand uneasy She looks around

SHE knows where she is She is near OVERTURNED TREE where
Caleb set the first trap

How did she get there
She turns back
THOMASIN (CONTD)
Caleb Burt
Nothing

THOMASIN (CONTD)
Caleb

She runs on toward home

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - LATER

CALEB holds his musket ready THE TREES and underbrush have
become even more dense and tangled

He prays aloud as he walks
CALEB

O God my Lord I now begin
O help me and Ill leave my sin
For I repentant now will be
From evil I will turn to thee
None ever shall destroy my faith
Nor do I mind what Satan saith

O God my Lord I now begin
O help me and Ill leave my sin -

He hears the yelp of the dog It echoes in the wood

He runs fast after the noise He cannot see through the mist
He keeps running

Running

He trips and falls

IN FRONT OF HIM ARE THE BLOODY REMAINS OF FOWLER STILL HOT
STILL BREATHING HIS LAST BREATHS

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE WOOD - DUSK

THOMASIN clumsily weaves through crackling branches
Daylight is waning

She breaths heavily trying to run but she is exhausted
All of a sudden she hears something faint voices
They are almost inaudible

WILLIAM (0S)
Caleb Thomasin

KATHERINE (0S)
Caleb

She picks up her pace

EXT A WINDING PATH - DUSK

CALEB trudges through a strange winding path of dense
twisting vines and thorns

He tries to run but the rain fog and spiky terrain slow
him down

His stockings get caught on some thorns
He recoils in pain and drops THE MUSKET

He tries to disentangle himself further cutting his fingers
and legs

He tries to pick up the musket but it is caught in THE
THORNS He pulls and pulls and it only makes things worse

His hands bleed more He is crying

IN THE DISTANCE IS A SWEET MELODY A WOMAN HUMMING

He turns his head to find where the music is coming from
A few yards in front of him is THE HARE
THE HARE JUMPS AWAY

CALEB FOLLOWS LEAVING THE MUSKET IN THE RAIN

EXT THE EDGE OF THE WOOD - THE NEXT MOMENT

THOMASIN comes to the edge of the tree line and sees her

father in the last light of dusk

THOMASIN
Father Father

He hears her and runs toward her

WILLIAM
Thomasin

They meet WILLIAM picks her up in his arms

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Thomasin My girl

He hugs her tight in the rain He rubs his cheek on hers
WILLIAM looks into her glassy eyes
WILLIAM (CONTD)
Where is thy brother
EXT WITCH’S HOVEL - DUSK

CALEB emerges from the barbed path to see a faint warm light
The humming is more distinct

Through the mist and rain THE WITCH’S HOVEL becomes visible

The pointed structure sits up high on four knotted tree
trunks Matted branches overhang its sagging moss-—grown
thatch-roof upon which there is no chimney just a hole
puffing smoke The whole thing looks held together by ill-
omened weeds plants and sinister roots that grow all over
and through the muddy walls like a plague

A rotting foot-ladder leads up to the slightly open front
door Firelight glows from within

CALEB continues to walk toward the humming THE HARE is
nowhere to be seen

He stumbles through a large FIRE PIT with BONES strewn about
the ground Rain plinks on a huge IRON CAULDRON in the center
of the pit

Just then THE DOOR opens wider

CALEB stops short

Out steps a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN (20s) IN A RED CLOAK She smokes
a small CLAY PIPE

CALEB steps back He is soaking wet He tries his best to
stop crying to no avail

THE WOMAN comes forward and her very dirty but dainty bare
foot takes one step down the foot ladder

She leans forward She reaches her arms out sympathetically
toward CALEB

Her face is greasy but stunning Her filthy bodice is cut
quite low There are a few small moles on her ample breast

CALEB sees this all He stays still The rain falls

THE WOMAN beckons him

CALEB walks toward her he is drawn to her He can’t help
it

She crouches on the foot ladder
CALEB is now face to face with her
She smiles at CALEB

Some of her teeth are crooked and browned near the gums it
is startling but she is beautiful all the same

She strokes CALEB’S head and embraces him
Tears still fall from CALEB’S eyes He trembles

He looks at THE WOMAN’S face he looks into her hypnotic
AMBER EYES

She smiles so sweetly
She draws CALEB NEAR
SHE KISSES CALEB SENSUALLY ON THE MOUTH

SHE PULLS HIM IN TIGHTER

SUDDENLY HER HAND NOW OLD AND UGLY CREEPS AROUND AND GRABS
THE BACK OF HIS HEAD LIKE A CLAW SHE PUSHES HIS MOUTH
FURTHER INTO HERS

Guilty Soaking wet

KATHERINE
What’s the matter with thee

KATHERINE (CONTD)
I never wished to be a shrew to
thee I have become as Job’s wife
I know it but since Sam since
My heart has turned to stone

(KATHERINE swells but
keeps her emotions in
check) )

I had dreamed once - twas when I
was of Thomasin’s years - that I
was with Christ upon earth I was
so very near him and in many tears
for the assurance of the pardon of
my sins and was so ravished with
his love towards me I thought it
far exceeding the affection of the
kindest husband The impression of
it was so deep in my heart when I
waked my pillow had turned to
tears

WILLIAM

KATHERINE
And since Samuel disappeared I
have such a sad weakness of faith
that I cannot shake it I cannot
see Christ’s help as near I pray
and pray but I cannot I fear
I cannot ever feel that same
measure of love again

Thou shalt have of it in heaven

of the shed

-INTERCUT BETWEEN WILLIAM AND CHILDREN THE SHED-

WILLIAM throws the axe to the ground He whispers to God

WILLIAM
It is my fault

He falls hard to his knees His muscles shake with fatigue

WILLIAM (CONTD)
I confess it I confess it

He scoops up a hand full of earth and holds it tight in his
fist He looks to heaven

WILLIAM (CONTD)

O my God I am false I am bemired
with the filth of pride I am I
know it Dispose of me as thou
wilt yet redeem my children

They cannot tame their natural
evils

CLOSE ON THOMASIN listening She takes in her father’s
heavy words

WILLIAM (CONTD)

I lie before thee a coward and
thine enemy and lick the dust of
thy earth

WILLIAM brings the fist of dirt to his mouth and swallows
it

He takes another handful

WILLIAM (CONTD)

I beg thee wash them clean in thy
blood I beg thee my Christ save
my children Save them I beg
thee

CLOSE ON THOMASIN listening
WILLIAM (0S) (CONTD)

I beg thee I have not damned my

EXT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

THE FARM waits quietly in the moonlight

No one is outside

No candle light creeps through the cracks in the door
The wind blows

Brittle branches rattle and snap

The tall trees creek and moan

Far away is the faintest sound of “clickety-clackety-
clickety-clackety-clickety-clackety-clickety-clackety”

It echoes through the forest and the farm

INT GOAT SHED - NIGHT

JONAS AND MERCY lie awake in the hay and straw with the
sleeping goats

THOMASIN is asleep on the other side of the shed
“Clickety-clackety clickety-clakety”
THE TWINS HEAR IT IS IT GETTING LOUDER

THEY CLUTCH EACH OTHER TIGHT

INT FARMHOUSE CANOPY BED - NIGHT

KATHERINE lies on her pillow half asleep SHE FAINTLY HEARS A
GIGGLING BABY She opens her eyes

It is utterly black

She gets out of bed fumbling to light a taper She puts it
to a dying ember and the taper illuminates her face

In front of her is THE SILVER CUP How can this be
She leans toward it

THE BABY GIGGLES again

SHE GASPS AND TURNS behind her

CALEB sits on a stool holding SAMUEL on his lap They are
clean and healthy and illuminated by a dim ethereal light

SAMUEL wears a christening gown
KATHERINE gets up and goes to them
CAMERA STAYS ON KATHERINE

KATHERINE
My lambs My angels

Her face glows with joy Her happy tears wash the grief from
her face She is beautiful

CALEB (0S)
(whispering)
Mother We have longed to see you
so
THEY EMBRACE

KATHERINE goes to her knees and looks up at CALEB She takes
SAM from his arms SHE laughs

KATHERINE
As I to thee

Her eyes light up
KATHERINE (CONTD)
I must wake thy father He will be
so glad-
CALEB (0S)
(whispering) )

No let him sleep

CALEB strokes her hair

INTEXT GOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
JONAS and MERCY clutch each other
The wind blows

The clickety-clackety through the trees has grown louder
Closer

Pause

The clickety-clackety comes again this time they can hear
the branches breaking off and falling upon the roof of the
goat shed and on to the ground right next to them

Then they hear a light THUMP on the grass

Now footsteps in the grass

They see SHADOWS moving through the wooden slats of the goat
shed

They hear a SCRATCHING on the wall of the shed
Someone is trying to open the door
A figure scuttles around the shed

They hear the sound of something burrowing or digging

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

CALEB (0S)
(whispering)
We would see you oft mother Would
that please you

KATHERINE
Aye

CALEB (0S)
(whispering)

I have brought a book for you

Mother Will you look at it with

me

KATHERINE
Aye

KATHERINE (CONTD)
One moment yet Samuel is hungry
Come come my little Sam

KATHERINE PUTS SAM TO FEED AT HER BREAST She smiles and
closes her eyes She holds up the back of his head

She feels at home again

EXT GOAT SHED - NIGHT

MERCY and JONAS see something in the shed crawling around
with them They are squeezing each other’s arms in fear

Jonas lets out a whimper
JONAS

Flora Flora
Pause

There is something near the nanny goats

JONAS (CONTD)
Girl

THEY MOVE EVER SO SLIGHTLY CLOSER

THEY GO CLOSER

THERE IS SOMETHING UNDER FLORA MOVING AROUND RHYTHMICALLY
A BONEY SPINE OF SOME PALE BEAST IS ROCKING BACK AND FORTH

MERCY
Flora

MERCY leans forward

IT IS THE HUNCHBACK OF THE OLD WITCH SHE IS SUCKING ON THE
GOAT’S TEAT

JONAS AND MERCY SCREAM

THE WITCH TURNS AROUND HER BLOODY JAWS flash for a moment in
the scraps of moonlight within the shed

SHE REACHES HER BLOODY TALONS TOWARD THEM
THE CHILDREN KEEP SCREAMING backing away

THOMASIN WAKES UP AND SHRIEKS

THE SOUND OF JONAS AND MERCY’S GOAT-BELLS CLANK AND CLATTER

OVER THEIR SCREAMS

INT FARMHOUSE - THE SAME TIME

AUDIO OF THE SCREAMING AND CLATTERING CONTINUES

WIDE KATHERINE SITS IN THE DARK FARMHOUSE BREAST FEEDING A
LARGE BLACK RAVEN

THE RAVEN FLAPS ITS WINGS

BLACK

OVER BLACK A wooden bang Bang Bang

INT FARMHOUSE CANOPY BED - DAWN

WILLIAMS eyes open wearily
The banging is coming from the side of the house

With each bang the house shakes and wood cracks Bits of clay
crumble off the walls

WILLIAM hears BLACK PHILLIP bleating loudly
He leaves the bed and throws on his breeches and boots

KATHERINE sits up and follows him with her eyes not leaving
her bed

BLOOD SOAKS HER SHIFT AROUND HER NIPPLE

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAWN

WILLIAM leaves the house and goes into the misty farmyard
BLACK PHILLIP IS BUCKING THE SIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE WITH HIS
HORNS Clapboards splinter off He bleats and grunts kicking
up dirt

WILLIAM yells and shoos him away

WILLIAM
Back Back

BLACK PHILLIP starts running madly around the farmyard
WILLIAM looks ahead

The thatch on THE GOAT SHED is all torn up THERE IS A GIANT
HOLE IN THE ROOF

The door William boarded-up has been smashed open Fodder and
dung are spread out all over the ground of the farmyard

He walks closer
THE TWO NANNY GOATS LAY DEAD their udders bleeding
JONAS AND MERCY ARE GONE

THOMASIN LIES AWAKE shuddering in the fetal position
splashed in BLOOD

BLACK PHILLIP stands there He bleats again steam comes from
his mouth and nostrils

WILLIAM goes directly to THE CHOPPING BLOCK and grabs the
AXE

He marches over to BLACK PHILLIP
THE GOAT runs round him

WILLIAM runs after it he raises the AXE high

WILLIAM takes a swipe and misses THE GOAT

THE GOAT bucks WILLIAM and knocks him to the ground taking
the wind out of him then runs across his legs

WILLIAM heaves and then gets up

THE GOAT gallops toward THE WOOD PILE

WILLIAM runs after him limping He hacks at BLACK PHILLIP
slicing his shoulder

THE GOAT SCREAMS AND RAMS WILLIAM INTO HIS HUGE STACK OF
FIREWOOD

BLACK PHILLIP’S HORNS RUN THROUGH WILLIAM’S STOMACH ONE GOES
OUT HIS BACK

UPON THE IMPACT THE LOGS TEETER AND AN AVALANCHE OF LOGS
TUMBLE DOWN ON WILLIAM

BLACK PHILLIP runs off

WILLIAM struggles under the huge pile of wood BLOOD pours
from his mouth his abdomen and his head

He moves no more
THOMASIN walks ghost-like toward her dead father
She kneels down next to him
She reaches her hand out to touch his face
JUST THEN
KATHERINE (0S)
(screaming)
What hast thou done
KATHERINE grabs THOMASIN’S HAIR and yanks her to her feet
THOMASIN shrieks
She scrambles away from KATHERINE

KATHERINE looks at William’s corpse and the destroyed goat

shed and THOMASIN stained with blood
KATHERINE’S face is empty

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
Where are they

THOMASIN
I know not what I saw-

KATHERINE
(overlapping)
WHERE ARE THEY

THOMASIN
I did nothing She came from the
sky - she -

KATHERINE
(overlapping)
Devil You have their blood upon
thy hands

KATHERINE is half-laughing half-crying

KATHERINE (CONT’D)
It is you It is you

THOMASIN runs rapidly toward the side of the house
KATHERINE follows her

THOMASIN stumbles over a basket of corn she braces herself
against the side of the house

THOMASIN
I am your daughter

KATHERINE
The Devil is in thee and hath had
thee You are smeared of his sin
You reek of Evil You have made a
covenant with death

THOMASIN
Mother

KATHERINE
You bewitched thy brother proud
slut

THOMASIN

Stop it Mother

KATHERINE
Did you not think I saw thy
sluttish looks to him bewitching
his eye as any whore

THOMASIN
What say you to me

KATHERINE
And thy father next

THOMASIN
Mother

KATHERINE
You took them from me They are
gone

THOMASIN
No

KATHERINE

You killed my children

KATHERINE has THOMASIN pressed right up against the
clapboards

THOMASIN
No

THOMASIN pushes her mother back
KATHERINE slaps her in the face

KATHERINE
You killed thy father

KATHERINE slaps and hits her THOMASIN is forced down on to
the BENCH by the door

THOMASIN
(overlapping)
Let go Stop stop I love you
Please Mother I love you

KATHERINE
(overlapping)
Witch WITCH

THOMASIN
(overlapping)
Stop it Stop it STOP IT

THOMASIN is struggling to get KATHERINE off of her but she

can’t KATHERINE is using all her force THOMASIN reaches
behind her for something anything The first thing that
reaches her blind fingers is THE RUSTY BILLHOOK THOMASIN
unknowingly takes it up

SHE SWINGS IT AND SLASHES HER MOTHER IN THE HEAD

KATHERINE gives a stunned look and BLOOD gushes from her
wound

THOMASIN is in shock at what’s she’s done
THOMASIN
Forgive me Forgive me Mother

mother-

THOMASIN takes a step forward BUT THEN KATHERINE STARTS TO
STRANGLE THOMASIN

She squeezes her hands tight around her daughter’s neck
turning red trying to scream

THOMASIN TRIES TO GET HER MOTHER OFF OF HER SHE CAN’T

KATHERINE KEEPS STRANGLING HER

THOMASIN IN TURN HACKS AT KATHERINE WITH THE BILLHOOK
AGAIN HER EYES CLOSED

SHE HACKS AGAIN AND AGAIN UNTIL SHE CAN GET AWAY
THOMASIN escapes from her mother’s clutches

KATHERINE collapses on THOMASIN

THOMASIN lies there with her mother’s heavy body on her

Pause

THOMASIN is shaking uncontrollably breathing fast -
adrenaline still coursing through her body THE BILLHOOK
drops out of her hand

She tries to move KATHERINE’S head but it falls limp
KATHERINE is dead

Pause

THOMASIN lets out quiet deeply mournful cry

She hugs her mother’s corpse

Tightly

Pause

Then slowly slowly the hug releases and THOMASIN’S face
begins to fall numb

Still trembling on her back THOMASIN crawls awkwardly out
from under KATHERINE pushing her mother off her

THOMASIN gets up and walks slowly not looking at the bodies
She walks around the farmyard like a ghost

She looks out at THE OLD OAK TREE Out to CALEB’S GRAVE
Pause

She is alone

INT FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Entering the house THOMASIN takes off her bloody bodice and
skirt and leaves them on the floor

She takes a blanket from her parents bed and drapes it over
her shoulders covering her bloody shift She sits at the
table

She puts her head on the table Empty

She closes her eyes

BLACK

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
THOMASIN wakes in the same position

All is dark in the house The wind blows the door open and
shut Open and shut Open

THOMASIN turns to the door The blanket falls to the floor

The door beckons her

EXT FARM - NIGHT

THOMASIN holds a lit taper and walks barefoot out into the
night wearing only her shift

BLACK PHILLIP stands before her Breath from his nostrils

catches the moonlight
The wind blows

BLACK PHILLIP walks into the shambles of THE GOAT SHED

INT GOAT SHED - NIGHT
THOMASIN holds the candle up to see BLACK PHILIP’S face

NOTE CAMERA stays on THOMASIN (we never see BLACK PHILLIP’S
FACE )

THOMASIN
(whispers )
Black Phillip I conjure thee to
speak

Speak as thou dost speak to Jonas
and Mercy

(pause )

Dost thou understand my English
tongue

Pause Nothing

THOMASIN (CONT’D)
Answer me

Pause Nothing
THOMASIN is truly alone
She turns her head and takes a step away

BUT JUST THEN A DEEP RESONANT VOICE QUIET CALM AND COLD
REPLIES

BLACK PHILLIP (0S)
What dost thou want

THOMASIN tuns back astonished

THOMASIN
What canst thou give

BLACK PHILLIP (0S)
Wouldst thou like the taste of
butter

A pretty dress
(MORE )

BLACK PHILLIP (0S) (CONTD)

Wouldst thou like to live
deliciously

Pause

THOMASIN
Yes

BLACK PHILLIP (0S)
Wouldst thou like to see the world

THOMASIN
What will you from me

BLACK PHILLIP (0S)
Dost thou see a book before thee

BLACK PHILLIP’S hooves step around a massive RED LEATHER
BOOK Centuries old

AS BLACK PHILLIP’S LEFT HOOF LEAVES FRAME HIS RIGHT FOOT
CROSSES NOW IN THE SHAPE OF A GAUDY CAVALIER’S BOOT WITH A
JANGLING GOLD SPUR

THOMASIN looks up from the ground back to BLACK PHILLIP’S
face

THOMASIN
Aye

BLACK PHILLIP (0S)
Remove thy shift

THOMASIN hesitates she pulls the thin string on her shift
awkwardly and child-like She closes her eyes She thinks she
is ready She gives in

If falls off her body

(NOTE WHILE “APPEARING” NUDE TO THE AUDIENCE THOMASIN’S
BREASTS “ETC” WILL NEVER BE IN FRAME)

THOMASIN hears THE SPURS jangle around her

THOMASIN
I cannot write my name

BLACK PHILLIP (0S)
I will guide thy hand

BEHIND HER CROSSES BLACK PHILLIP NOW A BEAUTIFUL BEARDED MAN
WITH A DARK COMPLEXION

Only glimpses of his face and gleams from his gold buttons
and silk trimmings are seen

HIS LARGE RICHLY EMBROIDERED BLACK LEATHER GAUNTLETS TAKE
HER SLENDER WHITE SHOULDERS

HIS SHINY LOCKS OF SABLE HAIR COCKEREL FATHERS AND BLACK
LACE SLOWLY SHROUD THOMASIN’S FACE

BLACK

EXT EDGE OF THE WOOD - NIGHT

WIDE CAMERA ON HER BACK THOMASIN rides naked on the back of
BLACK PHILLIP (a goat again) her hair falls freely behind
her They journey deep into THE WOOD

INT THE WOOD - NIGHT

Now within the wood the “clickety-clackety” of broomsticks
flying through trees above their heads is heard

EXT THE WITCH’S HOVEL - NIGHT
AS THOMASIN emerges from the path she sees a freakish sight

Half-visible in the darkness still far from THOMASIN are a
dozen women old women women in their middle years young
women - all grotesque - some humpbacks and cripples All
appear misshapen and distorted by the night All of them are
filthy and nude or in strange patches and shreds of clothing
They hold broomsticks poles distaffs and pitchforks

THE WITCHES DANCE gyrating shaking and quivering in a
trance-like reverie around a cauldron and fire in front of
THE WITCHS HOVEL Depraved Subhuman Bestial

THOMASIN AND BLACK PHILLIP walk closer to the circle
WHEN THE COVEN OF WITCHES sees them they shriek and cackle

with delight - their faces contort from their laughter THEY
WELCOME THOMASIN with their eyes

THOMASIN still astride BLACK PHILLIP smiles SHE JOINS THE
CIRCLE laughing a little too blushing then laughs more
and more WITH EVERY GROWING MOMENT HER SORROWS MELT AWAY

VERY SLOWLY AS THIS LAUGHTER INCREASES THE WITCHES BEGIN TO
LEVITATE AROUND THE FIRE rising on their brooms and poles

THEN THOMASIN AND BLACK PHILLIP RISE TOO SLOWLY GOING

HIGHER AND HIGHER

THOMASIN KEEPS LAUGHING EVER INCREASING IN PLEASURE AND
FREEDOM TEARS ROLL DOWN HER CHEEKS AS SHE LAUGHS PURE
ECSTACY

THEY RISE HIGHER

BLACK THE END
