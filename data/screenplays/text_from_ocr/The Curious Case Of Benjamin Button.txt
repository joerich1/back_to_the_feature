THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON

Written by

Eric Roth

Based on the short story by F Scott Fitzgerald

103007

As all things do it begins in the dark EYES blink

open Blue eyes The first thing they see is a WOMAN

near 40 standing looking out a window watching the wind
blowing rattling a window

A WOMANS (V0O)
What are you looking at

CAROLINE
The wind Mother They say a
hurricane is on its way Youve
been asleep I was waiting to
see you

1 INT HOSPITAL ROOM NEW ORLEANS - MORNING PRESENT 1

Now we see were in a hospital room with layers of white
enamel paint trying without success to hide the years
An old WOMAN past 80 withered still regal with a green
turban around her bald head is propped by pillows her
blue eyes looking out at us from her bed Shes
connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
drip Her name is DAISY FULLER She speaks with a
Southern lilt

DAISY
If it wasnt for hurricanes we
wouldnt have a hurricane season

CAROLINE
Ive forgotten what the weather
can be like here Ive lived with
four seasons so many years now

We see a young Black Woman a caregiver DOROTHY BAKER
in a corner thumbing a magazine with one eye at the
window

DOROTHY BAKER
I saw on the news theyre
predicting trouble

DAISY
1928 they stacked people like
firewood to close a hole ina
levee

But Daisy has other things on her mind murmuring

DAISY (CONTD)
It all runs together like a
fingerpainting I feel like Im
on a boat drifting

CAROLINE
(tenderly)
Can I do anything for you Mother
Make anything easier

DAISY
Hmmm There is nothing to do
Caroline This is what it is
Im finding it harder to keep my
eyes open my mouth all filled
with cotton

And agitated feeling confined she scratches at her
nightgown as if it were sticking to her she starts to take
it off Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her

DOROTHY BAKER
There there Miss Daisy youll
scratch yourself to ribbons
(to Caroline)
Its their way of letting go
(the finality)
probly today

Caroline is well aware of it but the words her
admonition of death being so close at hand makes
everything even more present

CAROLINE
Do you want more medication
Mother The doctor said you can
have all you want

Daisy is quiet looking into the distance Caroline
seeking closure sits on the bed with her and starts to
cry Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter
comforting her

CAROLINE (CONTD)

A friend told me she never had a
chance to say goodbye to her
mother

(grateful to have the

chance)
I wanted to thank you Mother for
bringing me into this world For
raising me so well

(MORE) 1
CAROLINE (CONTD)

I wanted to tell you how much

youve meant to me Im going to

miss you so much
They hold each other for some time They separate
And theres an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
about nothing left to say to each other a hole in
their relationship Caroline fills it with the eternal

question

CAROLINE (CONTD)
Are you afraid

DAISY
Curious What comes next

She winces at some physical pain

DOROTHY BAKER
The pains coming more steadily
Her breathing will falter soon
No need for her to suffer
She raises the morphine level Daisy closes her eyes
drifting with the morphine and a thought a dream a
sound crosses her mind and she says

DAISY
They built that train station in
1918 Your father was there the
day it opened He said a tuba
band was playingOom-pah-pah

EXT THE NEW TRAIN STATION NEW ORLEANS - DAY 1918

And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting
ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
TRAIN STATION

DAISY
Oom-pah-pah oom-pah-pahThe
finest clockmaker in all of the
South built that clock

INT CLOCKMAKERS SHOP NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1917

We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless
array of clocks and watches

DAISYS (VO)
His name was Mr Gateau Mr
Cake

INT THE HOSPITAL ROOM NEW ORLEANS - MORNING PRESENT

The slightest of smiles crosses Daisys lips saying to
herself again Mr Cake

INT CLOCKMAKERS SHOP NEW ORLEANS - MORNING PRESENT

We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small
delicate hands Mr Cake working in his downstairs
workshop More than a few clocks stroke midnight a
handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop

3A

DAISYS (VO)
He was married to a Creole of
Evangeline Parish and they had a
son

Taking his arm she helps him up to show him to his bed

DAISYS (V0O) (CONTD)
Did I mention Mr Gateau was from
birth absolutely blind

6 INT CLOCKMAKERS SHOP NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1917
The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working

DAISYS (V0O)
And when their son came of age
like boys will do he joined the
army They saw him off at the old
train station

7 EXT OLD TRAIN STATION NEW ORLEANS - DAY 1917

An old wooden barn of a building Their son hugging his
parents getting on a flatbed train crowded with other
soldiers pulling away Mr Gateau blindly waving his
hat goodbye to his son

DAISYS (VO)
Oh how he worked for months he
did nothing but work on the clock
for the great train station

8 INT WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKERS HOME - NIGHT 1918

The sound of clocks constant ticking Mr Gateau at

work
DAISYS (VO)
One day a letter came
Blanche comes into the workshop a letter in her
hand She reads to her blind husband

BLANCHE DEVEREUX
I am sorry to inform you that
your son was killed fighting for
his country at the battle of the

Marne In the death of Sgt
Martin Gateau I lose one of my
most trusted men

(MORE )

BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONTD)
When I informed members of our
company he had fallen on every
face could be seen the mark of

sorrow we were in hope the
Lord would spare him to return
home together Alas this was not

to be I send along his pants
shirt cavalry pin kerchief and
haircomb

DAISY (V0O)
Mr Gateau done for the night
went up to his bed

Mr Gateau blindly feeling his way up the stairs

DAISYS (V0O)
And their son came home

EXT OLD TRAIN STATION NEW ORLEANS - DAY 1918

We see Mr Cake in his familiar hat his wife holding
his arm standing among the rows of coffins

DAISYS (V0O)
They buried him where the Gateau
family had been buried for a
hundred and seven years

EXT NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY - DAY 1918

An old New Orleans cemetery vines crawling the
sepulchers

DAISYS (V0O)
Mr Cake went back to work on his
clock laboring to finish

INT THE CLOCK WORKSHOP NEW ORLEANS - LATE NIGHT 1918

Mr Gateau blindly setting the last spring closing up
the clock back finished at last

DAISYS (V0O)
It was a morning to remember
Papa said there were people
everywhere

INT THE NEW TRAIN STATION NEW ORLEANS - DAY 1918

And we see a large throng gathered to watch the unveiling
of the clock Politicians citizens and pickpockets
alike

12

DAISYS (V0O)
Even Teddy Roosevelt had come

And we see the distinctive figure of Theodore Roosevelt
in overcoat and hat the war heavy on his shoulders We
watch Mr Cake with the aid of an assistant climbing
the scaffolding to his clock covered by a velvet drape
He stands for a moment and with a simple tug releases
the purple swath People gasp at the magnificent
clock Mr Cake winds the clock which chimes a
glorious chime Pushed by an angel the second-hand
begins its eternal journeygoing around Everyone
cheers until they realize the clock is going the wrong
way traveling backwards in time A man shouts Its
running backwards

MONSIEUR GATEAU
I made it this way so that
perhaps the boys who were lost in
the war might stand and go home

again
EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY 1918 13
And we see just that bullets leaving mens wounds
sailing back into the rifles from whence they came
limbs whole again cannon balls rocketing backwards
into the cannons breech Fallen come to their feet to

live and breathe again

MONSIEUR GATEAU (V0O)
home to farm to work have

children to live long full
lives

INT THE NEW TRAIN STATION NEW ORLEANS - DAY 1918

Teddy Roosevelt bereft removes his hat

MONSIEUR GATEAU
Perhaps my own son might come
home again

EXT OLD TRAIN STATION NEW ORLEANS - DAY ANOTHER TIME

And we see his own son Martin once again full of life
hopping backward off the train to land where his journey
started back in the arms of his loving parents

INT TRAIN STATION NEW ORLEANS - DAY 1918

MONSIEUR GATEAU
Im sorry if I offended anybody I
hope you enjoy my clock

And his wife holding his arm he makes his way across the
terminal and exits The crowd is motionless They look

to Teddy Roosevelt for guidance but he simply puts his

hat on and with his guardians is gone

DAISYS (V0O)
Mr Cake was never seen again
Some say he died of a broken
heart Some say he went to sea
EXT THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER - AT THE END OF A DAY

Mr Gateau blindly rowing away
INT HOSPITAL ROOM NEW ORLEANS - MORNING PRESENT

DAISY
He just rowedrowedaway

The wind loudly rattles the windowthey turn to look

DOROTHY BAKER
Do you mind if I make myself a
call Ive got somebody watching
my little boy

CAROLINE

Its quiet Caroline sitting on the bed with her dying
mother with the wind knocking at the window After
some moments

CAROLINE (CONTD)
I hope I havent disappointed you
Mother

DAISY
Oh honey you could never
disappoint me

CAROLINE
I wished I had more to show for
myself I know you would have

sand

CAROLINE

DAISY
(going on)

envelope

CAROLINE
An envelope

Caroline doing what shes asked goes over to one of the
suitcases by the bed She opens it and among the
clothes and the keepsakes there is indeed an old
envelope

CAROLINE (CONTD)
This one

DAISY
I tried to read it a hundred
different times but I couldnt
bring myself

CAROLINE
What do you mean

DAISY
Read it to me
Daisy closes her eyes Caroline takes out a sheath of
papers Its a journal of some kind written in
longhand Pages have come undone scraps of paper

even some napkins

DAISY (CONTD)
(murmurs)
Just the sound of your voice 18

And for her mothers sake she begins to read it with
no particular interest like reading to someone a
selection from a menus choices

CAROLINE

Its dated April 4 1985 It
says New Orleans

(after a beat)
This is my last will and
testament

(which starts to

engage her)
I dont have much to leave few

possessions no money really I
will go out of this world the same
way I came in alone and with
nothing

(finding herself

engaged)
All I have is my story Im
writing it now while I still
remember it

Shes interested She looks over at her mother But her
mothers eyes are closed

CAROLINE (CONTD)
My name is Benjamin

And Carolines voice becomes a young MANS voice
A MANS (VO)

Benjamin Button and I was born
under unusual circumstances

EXT NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918
THERES SUDDENLY AN EXPLOSION OF FIREWORKS
BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
The war to end all wars had ended
We see the streets of New Orleans are filled with
drunken singing revelers cars jamming the
cobblestones people kissing shouting joyful Another
burst of fireworks
BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO) (CONTD)
I was told it was an especially
good night to be born

9A
19

And we see in the fireworks light a young MAN in his
early 30s THOMAS BUTTON running up to the gate of a
fashionable town home He nearly collides with a PRIEST
who arrives there at the same time Thomas runs past
him up the steps

INT BUTTON HOUSE NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918 20

He runs past a solemn Maid and up a long staircase
barging into the MASTER BEDROOM

INT MASTER BEDROOM BUTTON HOUSE - NIGHT 1918

where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed
frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the
help of the small domestic staff the PRIEST enters

THOMAS BUTTON
(seeing him)
Why are you here

THE DOCTOR
Thomas Im afraid shes not going
to survive

And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty
young woman and the maids bringing bedsheets

futilely start to change her bloody linens

THOMAS BUTTON

Thats enough All of you
They move out of the way and Thomas kneels beside his
wife Shes pale white fear in her soft brown eyes

He takes her hand

THOMAS BUTTON (CONTD)
I came as quickly as I could
Im sorry I took so long the
streets are filled with people

As if to underscore it fireworks go off

THOMAS BUTTON (CONTD)
You are going to be alright my
dearest darling I will not let
anything happen to you

HIS YOUNG WIFE
Promise me Thomas

And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY But

Thomas cant take his eyes from his dying wife

HIS YOUNG WIFE (CONTD)
Promise me he has a place

He doesnt understand She looks up at him holds his
hand tight then she slips away The Doctor listening
for her pulse He covers her its quiet the
Priests murmured incantations the housemaids
crying

21

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
She gave her life for me And
for that I am forever grateful

Thomas still holding her hand is unable to let go
When we hear again the BABY CRYING The BABYS CRY is
not quite right It is not an infants cry for succor
or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs Its a
deep haunting cry from some primal soul They all
turn and the room stills listening as The BABY
continues its mournful WAIL Only Thomas goes to
answer The Baby in a basket swaddled in a thick
blanket its face covered with cloth Thomas goes to
lift it to see his sons face

MAID
Mr Button

He lifts the cloth anyway He recoils for he has
seen some kind of horror He makes the smallest of
sounds a whispered Ohhhh And then he suddenly
snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of
the room downstairs outside

EXT NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918 22

Thomas tears on his face carrying his CRYING BABY
through the streets Pushing through crowds

EXT A BRIDGE NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918 23

he comes along an old bridge over a waterway the
air heavy with the haze of fireworks the water dark
23A

brokenhearted he lifts the baby to throw it into the
black water He is just at the apex of this throw when
despite his sadness he cant bring himself to do it
Instead cradles the newborn

THOMAS
Im sorry Im so sorry

A LANTERN lights his face A POLICEMAN down the way

POLICEMAN
What are you doing there

The BABY starts to CRY

POLICEMAN (CONTD)
What do you have there

Thomas takes off the Policeman after him Thomas
carrying the CRYING BABY running

EXT NEW ORLEANS GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT 1918 23A
Thomas scuttling with the crying infant through narrow
streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the
large old moldering antebellum houses
EXT THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT 1918 24

He comes to an old three-story house with a screened
porch VOICES from inside PEOPLE TALKING and
LAUGHING The Baby soothed by the soft yellow light
by the music of the voices by the house itself -- stops
its mournful cry Thomas stops catching his breath
He looks in through the back porch the sounds of
VOICES coming Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back
porch steps He takes out every last dollar he has
tucking the money inside the Babys blanket We can
just see the figures of two people coming from inside
Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door And his
decision made he turns moving away from the house
leaving his child behind

A WOMANS (VO)
I couldve sworn I heard somebody
knockin

When a young Black Woman in a green dress comes onto

the porch A thin attractive woman in her late 20s
with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- Shes known as
QUEENIE Shes followed by a handsome Black man MR
WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY She looks out the
door and not seeing anything

QUEENIE
I guess not

She stands for a moment taking in the night air

QUEENIE (CONTD)
The air smells sweet

And she sings to herself a song from the time

TIZZY
You look very handsome tonight
Ms Queenie handsome as I ever
seen you The green matches
your eyes

QUEENIE
(fingering dress)
It isnt everyday a wars over
Mr Weathers
(MORE)

QUEENIE (CONTD)
We have to mark it somehow You
aint no slouch yourself

He smiles tips his hat And they stand in the quiet

TIZZY
Hamberts back in town came
home legless but he home were
gonna throw a party for him
help get himself situated

(beat)
I know you was sweet on him one
time

QUEENIE
Sweeter than I shoulda been
Lost his legs you say You never

know whats comin for you

And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head
out

OLD WOMAN
Ms Simone messed herself

QUEENIE
She got to stop doing that or
its diapers for her Ill be

right there Mrs Jameson

The woman disappears inside Queenie not anxious to
go

QUEENIE (CONTD)
It sure is nice out here Mr

Weathers

TIZZY
Awful nice Ms Queenie Come
out back for a moment take your

mind away from things
He pushes open the porch screen door

QUEENIE
(smiles)
Just a moments time

He offers her his hand She takes it He backs out of
the house holding her hand and he suddenly steps right
on top of the Baby The baby wails Tizzy stumbles
nearly falls 24
TIZZY
What in Gods name
QUEENIE
What is that A fish crawl out of
the river

She moves to it pushes aside the blanket and freezes

QUEENIE (CONTD)
God in heaven

IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY What we
see is the prominent bald head of any newborn but it
has the face the wrinkled skin the faded eyes of an
octogenarian Indeed if we didnt know any better it
would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed
old man

QUEENIE (CONTD)
My Goodness the Lord did
something here

TIZZY
Look like a milk wagon run over
it three times and back

And theyre both motionless not quite sure what to do

TIZZY (CONTD)
I didnt see it layin there I
hope I didnt hurt it none
steppin on it like that

The BABY wont stop its mournful cry

TIZZY (CONTD)
We best leave it to the police

Ill go --
Queenie hesitates a longing
QUEENIE
Its for sure nobody wanted to
keep it

And making up her mind she suddenly grabs up the crying
baby taking it inside Tizzy anxiously whispering
something going in after her

INT THE NOLAN HOUSE NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918 25
A pianos playing a standard people singing Theres
a myriad of old dark rooms heavy furniture and
carpets an eclectic mixture of the possessions of
those who have lived and died here over many years and

we see a parlor is crowded with Old People from sixty to

ninety-five in various stages of health various
contraptions to keep them afloat An Old Age Home We
see Queenie moving quietly along a hallway carrying the
crying baby so as not to be seen Tizzy following her
still anxiously whispering after her

A WOMANS (V0O)
Where are you Queenie

QUEENIE
Hold your water
(and to Tizzy)
Go see to them

He does what she asks She hurries the baby into a small
room literally like a mouse house under the stairs

INT QUEENIES ROOM OLD HOUSE NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918
A small room tucked under the staircase

A WOMANS (V0O)
Queenie Apple she went and
messed herself all over again

QUEENIE
Jane Childress start her a bath
and mind your business Mrs
Duprey Youll be messing
yourself soon enough too

Theres a KNOCK on Queenies door
A WOMANS (V0O)
(whispers)
Somebody stole my necklace
QUEENIE
Ill be right with you Mrs
Hollister

She whispers to The Baby soothing it And looking for a
place to put it she opens a dresser drawer

QUEENIE (CONTD)
You may be as ugly as an old
pot but you still a child of
God

A WOMANS (V0O)
Queenie Apple she wont go
take a bath witout you

QUEENIE
Mercy Ill be right there

And with that she puts The Baby into the top dresser
drawer with her unmentionables and shuts it
leaving it open just a crack enough to breathe
Turning she sees an Old Woman looking very lost
looking in the room

MRS HOLLISTER
My sister gave those pearls to

me I cant find them
anywhere People are stealing my
jewelry

QUEENIE

Theyre right here Mrs
Hollister right ‘round your
pretty white neck

(moving her)
Come on now

Theres a sound of a door chime

A WOMANS (V0O)
Dr Rose has arrived for his
visit

Queenie takes a concerned look back at the Baby and
closes the door And we stay behind for a moment
inside Queenies underwear drawer with the smell of a
lilac sachet is the Baby with the face of an old
man looking up at the sliver of light coming into the
dresser drawer

INT PARLOR NOLAN HOUSE NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1918

We see the Doctor an older man in a tired suit who has
done this longer than he cares to remember finishing
examining one of the elderly boarders He puts his
things into his doctors bag Queenie comes beside him
saying something

28 INT QUEENIES ROOM - THAT NIGHT 1918 28

The Baby is lying on Queenies bed Dr Rose
stethoscope ever dangling washes his hands in a sink

DOCTOR ROSE
Hes nearly blind from

cataracts Im not sure he can
hear His bones indicate severe
arthritis His skin has lost all
elasticity His hands and feet
are ossified He has all the

deterioration the infirmities
not of a newborn but of a man
well in his eighties on the way to
his grave

QUEENIE
You mean to say hes dying

DOCTOR ROSE
Of old age His body is failing
him before his lifes begun

Theyre still looking at the strange baby

DOCTOR ROSE (CONTD)
Where did he come from

QUEENIE
(after a beat)

ts my sisters child From
Lafayette She had an unfortunate
adventure

(whispers)
The poor child got the worse of

DOCTOR ROSE

babies like these Queenie
Theres no room for another mouth
to feed here The Nolan
Foundation despite their good
intentions thinks this place is a
large nuisance as it is A baby

QUEENIE
(appealing)

You said he dont have long

DOCTOR ROSE
Queenie -- some creatures arent
meant to survive

She looks at the Baby determined

QUEENIE
He is a miracle thats for
certain just not the kind of

miracle one hopes to see

INT PARLOR NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT 1918

The Old People are sitting around the parlor talking

playing cards Queenie brings the baby bundle into the
room

QUEENIE
You all listen

And they stop what they are doing

QUEENIE (CONTD)

We have a visitor that will be
staying with us for a little
while My sister had a child but
couldnt see right by it Hes
known as

(a hesitation naming him)
Benjamin

(she likes the sound

of it)
Benjamin Hes not a well
child so we need to take very
good care of him

We see Tizzys come out of the kitchen watching with an
air of strong disapproval And an OLD WOMAN says

ONE OF THE WOMEN
I had ten children theres not
a baby I cant care for let me
see him

Queenie hesitates and gives the Baby to her The Old
Woman pushes the blanket back from the babys face

THE OLD WOMAN
(startled)
God in heaven he looks just like
my ex-husband

And theres laughter

29
QUEENIE
Hes prematurely old Doctor

Rose said he dont have much time
on this earth

A MAN
Join the club

They all laugh Their laughter makes the baby seem to
smile the lonely smile of an old dying man

INT QUEENIES ROOM - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT 1918 30

We see Queenie unable to sleep lying in bed looking

out a small window theres a light KNOCK on the
door Tizzy
TIZZY
Hambert sends his remembrance to
you
She nods The baby cries out and then its quiet

TIZZY (CONTD)
(meaning the baby)
Are you right out of your mind I
know you dont got all the parts
it takes to make one of your

own but this isnt yours to
keep this isnt even human
kind

With nothing left to be said he starts to go

QUEENIE
(whispers)
Mr Weathers Stay with me
tonight
He slows Shes quiet And she whispers

QUEENIE (CONTD)
You never know whats comin for
you

And as they move to be with one another to make love we
look over at the dresser drawer -- open just a crack
Benjamin lying among the unmentionables looking out at
the world

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
I found a home

INT THE HOSPITAL ROOM NEW ORLEANS - DAY PRESENT 31

Caroline with the journal on her knees Daisy eyes

knocking

CAROLINE

Caroline shrugs She looks through the book
CAROLINE
Some pages seem to be torn out

She discovers inside

CAROLINE (CONTD)

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
I didnt know I was a child
I thought I was like everyone else
who lived there an old man in my
golden years

The boarders eating dinner Queenie in a white

uniform along with Tizzy wearing a chefs hat and
apron helping her serve We move across the ancient
faces until we come to one particular face Wearing
eyeglasses now but the same wrinkled face weve come
to know the face of a very old man

33

The face of Benjamin Button when he should normally be a
six-year-old Hes sitting in a wheelchair now small
shrunken hunched with age legs and hands crippled with
arthritis Eyeglasses are just one addition a
hearing aid a bulky apparatus of its time is in one
ear But if we look even closer we can see there are
sprouts of hair wisps of white what would be the
last hair for some seem to be growing in As we
watch him eat he uses his fork like a child might
banging it just for the hell of it making noise

QUEENIE
Stop bangin that fork
(fixing it in his
arthritic hand)

Its for eating not for playin
with And use your napkin
please Mr Benjamin

And he does as hes told A staff member helps one of
the old men feeding him Benjamin just another old man
having dinner with his contemporaries

EXT THE PORCH NOLAN HOUSE NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1925 34

A line of old people in rockers Benjamin like any six-
year-old bored wheels his chair back and forth between
them until one of the oldsters who has had enough
sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair making
him come to an abrupt stop Benjamin sitting with the
other oldsters on the porch the old people rocking
Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall children
playing people talking

BENJAMIN BUTTON
Whats there

Nobody says anything rocking Benjamin eternally
curious needing to know suddenly wheels himself
precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall

is lower and he just sees the street children running
on the street playing carriages dropping people off
for a party He leans forward to get an even better
view When Queenie suddenly grabs him
QUEENIE
Benjamin Thats dangerous Come

back here

-Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the
safety of the old people out of sight of the street

INT QUEENIES ROOM - NIGHT 1925 35

The small room with the small window We see Benjamin in
a bed made on the floor Queenie in her bed

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
I loved her very much She was my
mother

And he reaches to hold her hand She generously takes
his hand And they lay like that holding hands Queenie

in bed her son the old man on the floor

BENJAMIN BUTTON
Somedays I feel like Im different
from the day before

QUEENIE
Everybody feels different about
themselves one way or another
Were all goin the same way just
taking different roads to get
there Youre on your own road
Benjamin

BENJAMIN BUTTON
How much longer do I have to live
Mother

QUEENIE
Just be thankful you got what
youre given You already here
longer than you supposed to be

We see the door quietly open Tizzy coming in

He looks at Benjamin

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)

Some nights I would have to sleep
alone

sitting him in his wheelchair Tizzy

going back down into the room to be with Queenie
shutting the door

INT THE PARLOR NOLAN HOUSE LATE AT NIGHT 1925

An Old Womans fallen fast asleep in an easy chair a

book on her lap Benjamin sitting alone in his

wheelchair listening to the sounds of the house

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
I didnt mind I would listen to
the house breathing All the
people sleeping I felt safe

Be he still wants to know Whats over there He wheels
himself over to sit at the window looking outside
looking at the streetlights the world beyond the gate
trying to see whats dangerous

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO) (CONTD)
It was a place of great routine
Every morning at 530 no matter

the weather General Winslow
US Army Retired raised the
flag

37 EXT THE FRONT LAWN NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING 1925

a coat for him Theres the sound of SOMEONE SINGING

(Shakespeare)
Kind keepers of my weak decaying
age Let dying Mortimer here rest

of death Nestor-like aged in an
age of care Argue the end of

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
On Saturday nights I would go to
Queenies church

INT CHURCH TENT NEW ORLEANS - A SATURDAY NIGHT 1926

A sweltering shout em up Negro gospel tent Queenie
pushes Benjamin in his wheelchair past a line of people
looking to be healed bringing him face to face with a
mountain of a PREACHER pouring sweat and full of fire

THE PREACHER
What can I do for you Sister

And Queenie whispers something to him
THE PREACHER (CONTD)
Her parts are all twisted up
inside so she cant have little
children

He puts his hand on her stomach

PREACHER
Lord if you could see clear to

forgive this woman her sins so she

can bear the fruit of the womb
(and shouts)

Out damnable affliction

He presses on her stomach making Queenie nearly fall
over held up by a NURSE in a crisp white uniform
And once shes regained her balance

THE PREACHER
(at Benjamin)
And whats this old mans
irrediction

QUEENIE
Hes got the devil on his back
trying to ride him into the grave
before his time

THE PREACHER
(touches Benjamin)
Out Zebuchar Out Beelzebub
(after a beat)
How old are you

41

And he says what is only true

BENJAMIN
Im seven but I look a lot older

PREACHER
(laughs)
God bless you Hes seven

The congregation laughs

THE PREACHER
This is a man who has optimism in
his heart Belief in his soul
We are all children in the eyes of
God Now we are going to get you
out of that chair were gonna
have you walk

(his hands on Bens
shoulders)
In the name of Gods glory rise
up

And Benjamin doing what hes asked barely able to his
legs akimbo stands The people all applaud

THE PREACHER (CONTD)
Now God is going to see you the
rest of the way Hes going to
see this little old man walk
without the use of a crutch or a
cane Hes going walk by
himself on faith and divine
inspiration alone Well show
that Devil where to go Walk
on

And Benjamin takes two very precarious steps and his poor
arthritic legs give out and he sprawls to the floor
The Aides in white nurses uniforms move to help but

THE PREACHER (CONTD)
Dont touch him
(kneeling to Benjamin)
Rise up old man

But Benjamin stays crumpled on the floor The Preacher
comes to his feet standing like a mountain over him

THE PREACHER (CONTD)
Rise up like Lazarus

Benjamin still lies on the floor
( ) 41

THE PREACHER (CONTD)
I said rise up

And Benjamin slowly but surely makes his way to his
feet

THE PREACHER (CONTD)
Yes and say hallelujah
(Hallelujah)
Now walk my old friend

Walk on

And Benjamin one crippled leg at a time hobbles across

the stage The people urging him on a string of
Hallelujahs Queenie comes to join him urging
him

QUEENIE

Let the Lord carry you

The Preacher walking along with him more a dance

than a walk shouting the name of the Lord Queenie and
The Preacher walking Benjamin across the stage
Benjamin making it to the other end to a roar of
Amens

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
Now when I look back on it it
was kind of miraculous But you
know the saying the Lord
Giveth and the Lord Taketh
away

That mountain of a Preacher in full exaltation to
God

THE PREACHER
Praise be to the Lord on the
highest

Suddenly pitches over flat on his face Having had a
spontaneous coronary lying center-stage deader than
the proverbial doornail The crisp uniformed nurses
running to attend to him and poor old Benjamin
haplessly looking around

INT THE PARLOR ROOM NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY 1926

world

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)
We stayed at a small hotel with

the grand name The Winter
Palace

EXT MURMANSK STREET RUSSIA - NIGHT 1941

Snow covers the street outside of a turn-of-the Century
hotel a front window looks into its lobby The
Winter Palace Hotel

INT WINTER PALACE RUSSIA - NIGHT 1941

Theres a packed BAR off the lobby We see Benjamin
sitting with Captain Mike their crew and a mixture of
other seamen Russians and other ethnics all speaking
different languages sitting and standing around tables
cluttered with bottles and glasses Captain Mike
drunk his shirt off is telling a Russian sailor
another interpreting for him -- about a tattoo he has
over his heart an upside down hummingbird

CAPT MIKE
I saws this tattoo puts on a mans
back in Singapore by Sakumoro the
greatest tattoo artist ever lived

And now we know why its upside down

CAPT MIKE (CONTD)

times a second If you was to

CAPT MIKE (CONTD)
Does you know what the figure-
eight is the mathematical symbol

Pointing at the symbol

CAPT MIKE (CONTD)
Infinity

And for some drunken reason no matter what language they
might speak they all laugh

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)
Everybody no matter what
differences they had the
languages the color of their
skin had one thing in common
they were drunk every single

night
Then theres a shout -- and as if to underscore things
the Brody twins are kicking the shit out of each other

again

114 INT LOBBY WINTER PALACE RUSSIA - NIGHT 1941

We see Benjamin waiting for the small caged elevator to
take him to his room He gets in the elevator operator
about to shut the grill door

A WOMANS (VO)
Would you wait please

And we see a WOMAN in her late 40s getting on the
elevator Benjamin looks over at her

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)
Her name was Elizabeth Abbott She
was not beautiful She was plain
as paper But she was as pretty

as any picture to me

Plain as paper ELIZABETH ABBOTT Directly behind her
walks a tall tired man in his 50s By the look of his
ruddy face and her silent mien theyre both drunk

Benjamin finds himself looking at her
( )

114

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
What are you looking at

She has a distinctly English accent Benjamin doesnt say
a word

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
If you must know we have a long
standing agreement never to go to
bed sober Isnt that right
darling

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)
Her husband was Walter AbbottHe
was Chief Minister of the British
Trade Mission in Murmansk and
he was a spy

They ride up Elizabeth has her shoes offShe sees him
noting her stocking feet The elevator finally rattles
to a stop and George and Elizabeth get off Starting

down the hallshe abruptly turns to say to Benjamin
so that its completely understood

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
I broke the heel off of one of my
shoesI dont usually walk
around in my bare feet

And as he watches her saunter along the hallway the
way drunks do endeavoring to keep her dignity

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)
They were long days there

EXT MURMANSK HARBOR RUSSIA - DAY 1941 115

Benjamin on the tug but its less fun now not much
adventure just hard work Fighting the snow and the

wind they tow a large freighter into port

INT BENJAMINS ROOM - WINTER PALACE - NIGHT 1941

Benjamin in his small room cold air blasting through
the windows looking out the window into the snowy
night

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)
And longer nights

He lays on his bed looking out at the dark sky the
snow falling

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)
One particular night when I was
having trouble sleeping

INT WINTER PALACE RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT 1941

Benjamin trudges down the stairs stepping tentatively
into the empty lobby He slows seeing ELIZABETH ABBOTT
in her bathrobe sitting alone and lonely and its
not the first time for her

BENJAMIN
Im sorry I cant sleep
Shes quiet She finally looks up but doesnt say
anything Theres an awkward momentexacerbated by

the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
I was going to make some
teawould you like some

76A

She shakes her head no He crosses through the empty
bar into an old KITCHEN He looks for tea Puts
water in a kettle As he watches the kettle boil
Elizabeth her arms folded across her chest as if she
were chilled stands by the door Benjamin without
asking takes a cup for her

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Milk Honey

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
Some honey thank you

He finds a large honey jar and seeing some dead flies
in with the sweet syrup he asks

BENJAMIN
Do you like flies with your tea

She smilesfor the first time A thin smile He
starts to stir the tea Elizabeth stopping him

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
You must let it steep for a
minute

BENJAMIN

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
Sit Theres a proper way to make
tea
BENJAMIN
Where Im from they just want it

She doesnt smile He gives her a cup of tea She
cradles the cup Theyre quiet drinking their

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
Youre a seaman I dont mean to

She nods Theyre quiet again She sits at an old wood
counter

ELIZABETH ABBOTT

Its an invitation to sit with her He pulls a stool
over sitting across from her

BENJAMIN
I didnt know I did I usually
sleep like a baby Something kept
me up

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
I never sleep Well rarely
anyway

He doesnt say anything
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)

My father when he was in his
eighties was so sure he was going

to die in his sleep He would
only take naps during the
afternoon so that death

couldnt catch him

BENJAMIN
Did he

117 117

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
Did he what
BENJAMIN
Die in his sleep

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
He died sitting in his favorite
chair listening to his favorite
program on the radio

BENJAMIN
(smiles)
He must have known something

She smiles at the idea Another one that goes as
quickly as its come And its quiet again

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
My husbands the British Trade
Minister Weve been here fourteen

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO) (CONTD)

Elizabeth in her bathrobe sitting in the empty lobby
waiting for him

120 INT KITCHEN WINTER PALACE RUSSIA - BEFORE DAWN 1941 120
Elizabeth and Benjamin quietly talking
BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)

A hotel in the middle of the night
can be a magical place
And we see the empty front desk and tiny silver bell
The vacant lobby with its musty old rugs The open
elevator waiting The dining room with its crisp
white tablecloths

120

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO) (CONTD)
A mouse stopping and running and
stopping

A mouse crossing the lobby floor doing just that

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO) (CONTD)
A radiator hissing A sink
dripping A floor creaking A
curtain blowing

We see and hear it all All the little sounds a
symphony that make up life in a hotel in the middle of
the night Benjamin and Elizabeth sitting quietly

drinking their tea

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO) (CONTD)
There is something peaceful even
comforting knowing that people
you love are asleep in their beds
where nothing can harm them

121 INT VARIOUS BEDROOMS - DEAD OF NIGHT 1941

Queenie and Tizzy asleep together in her bed Their
child on the floor The old people in their beds in the
old house Ngunda Oti asleep in a room somewhere The
unnamed womans grave A different kind of sleep And of
course Daisy in a New York apartment loft with other
dancers sleeping peacefully

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)
Elizabeth and I would talk through
the night until just before
dawn
122 INT KITCHEN - WINTER PALACE - RUSSIA - DAYBREAK 1941

Daylight starts to creep in she gets up about to
go she slows

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
I may have given you the wrong
impression

BENJAMIN
The wrong impression

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
You must think I dont love my
husband

122

BENJAMIN
Why do you say that

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
Married women dont usually sit
with strange men in a hotel in the
middle of the night I certainly
dont

BENJAMIN
(honestly)
I dont know what married women do
or dont do

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
Lets get one thing straight I
love him very much I happen to
think he is one of the smartest
and most considerate men I ever
met It is not his fault I decided
to spend my life in his shadow

And with that she gets up and leaves Benjamin left
with that thought

INT DINING ROOM WINTER PALACE RUSSIA - NIGHT 1941

Benjamin and Elizabeth in the empty dining room at a
table with a white tablecloth with some wine and
cheese Shes laughing now measurably loosened up

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
He started to take his pants
off Im afraid he misread me
completely

He laughs She looks through her wine glass at him

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
Do you notice how people look
better through a wine glass

He holds his up looking at herShe moves her glass
just looking at him

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
Youre a good looking man with or
without a wine glass

She picks at the tablecloth with her finger next to
his She puts her finger over his making a cross

123

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
We are all just crossing in the
night Sometimes we intersect

She leaves her finger there for a moment lingering
She abruptly moves it away

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
I should go to bed hell be up
soon

She hesitates And she kisses him and then hurries out
of the dining room As Benjamin sits in the empty
dining room the kiss left on his lips

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
It was the first time a woman had
ever kissed me Its something you
never forget

INT THE HOSPITAL ROOM NEW ORLEANS - DAY PRESENT

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
Youre delicious just as you

She laughs taking his arm walking to the dining room as
if going to dinner They sit at a table which she
has set for them Caviar and Vodka

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
Dont bother with the cheese or
the wine here theyre quite
common but the caviar and the
vodka are plentiful and sublime

She feeds him a spoonful of the caviarUnaccustomed to
it he swallows it too quickly

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)

Take your time If you eat it

all at once there will be nothing

left to enjoy savor it
She gives him another spoonful and takes one
herself He takes his time They both do savoring
it

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
(pouring)

Now a swallow of vodka

Which they do She laughs Looking at him

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
You havent been with many women

BENJAMIN
No Not many At least none ona

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
(smiles)
I feel like Im with a virgin

She runs her fingernail along his face

ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONTD)
I can feel the wind on your
face

They look at each other And this time Benjamin kisses
her It lingers She stops herself

hour

She quickly gets up And shes gone As Benjamin sits
in the empty dining room

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)
It took me a long time to go to
sleep

flattered takes it metaphorically

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
Thats such a nice thing to say

BENJAMIN
What mistakes

ELIZABETH ABBOTT
I kept waiting thinking I would
do something to change my
circumstance Do something

been hit by a torpedo We were

silently slips into the water disappearing under the
sea

that far out to sea before

And as Benjamin stands at the railing looking at the
sea

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0) (CONTD)
In the spring of 1945 when I
was 26 years old I went home

EXT THE NOLAN HOUSE NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT 1945

We see Benjamin suitcase in hand going up the walk to
the old house Were struck by the difference the old
man who had left to see the world has returned a
strikingly handsome man in his fifties The old blind
dog smelling ham ambles off the porch to meet him
Nothing seems to have changed An old woman we dont

know is rocking on the porch A black girl just 14 is
hanging out wash

BENJAMIN
Is your mother home

THE GIRL
Shes gettin supper ready

He goes up the porch inside

INT THE NOLAN HOUSE NEW ORLEANS - TWILIGHT 1945

Some old folks are in the front room Nobody we know
He moves by them into the kitchen the stovetop smoking
and gurgling He goes into the dining room Queenie
is busy setting the table He watches her for a
moment
BENJAMIN
(quietly)
Queenie
She turns seeing him she drops a plate
QUEENIE
Lord have mercyyoure home
She runs to embrace him We see shes aged the eight
years hes been gone and the 25 years or so since
weve known her now in her fifties

THE GIRLS (V0)
(asks)
Who is that mama

The Girl comes inside curious

QUEENIE
Your brother Benjamin

THE GIRL
I didnt know he was my brother

QUEENIE
(laughs)
Theres a shit load of things you
dont know

But her interest is in Benjamin

QUEENIE (CONTD)
(studying him)
You look like youve been born

again youre younger than the
springtime I think that
preacher laid the hands on you
brought you a second life I
knew the moment I saw you -- you
were special Every night I got

on my knees asking the Good Lord
to bring you back safely Remember
what I told you

BENJAMIN
You never know whats comin for
you

And they both share a good laugh at her homily glad to
be together once again

QUEENIE
Did you learn anything worth
repeating

BENJAMIN

I saw a lot of things
She touches the scar from the bullet on his forehead

QUEENIE
You seen some pain

He nods

QUEENIE (CONTD)
Some joy too

He nods that too And she holds him again

152 BENJAMIN
Wheres Tizzy
QUEENIE

Mr Weathers died in his sleep one
night last April Hes sleeping
comfortably now in the cemetery on
St James street God rest his
soul

BENJAMIN
Im so sorry

She turns from him so as not to cry

QUEENIE
Theres only one or two of them
left now They all just about
new waitin their turn like
everybody else I am so glad to
have I you back Now we got to
find you some proper work and get

And as she goes about readying the table for dinner
humming to herself

153 EXT PORCH NOLAN HOUSE - EVENING 1945

Benjamin sitting with a row of oldsters And feeling out
of place out of time he gets up and goes inside

154 INT PARLOR NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT LATER 1945

We see Benjamin playing the piano in the parlor the

particular tune the Woman had taught him an old man
sitting nearby seemingly listening Queenie looking
in
QUEENIE
Youre wasting your time hes
stone deaf Youll be staying in

what was Mrs DeSerouxs room now
youre too much of a man to stay
in the attic anymore

She goes about her business And as Benjamin goes back
to playing the piano for the deaf man playing for
himself

155 INT THE PARLOR NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT 1945

We see Mr Daws much older now asleep in an easy chair

Benjamin standing at the familiar window listening to

the silence of the house

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)

Its a funny thing about coming
home Smells the same Looks the
same Feels the same

Mr Daws awakens Seeing Benjamin As if he never left

MR DAWS
Did I ever tell you Ive been
struck by lightning seven times
Once I was sitting in my truck
listening to the radio

And we see just that Mr Daws sitting in his truck

getting belted by lightning

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0)

You realize whats changed is
you

While Benjamin stands locking out the window

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO) (CONTD)

And one evening not long after I

had been back

INT THE NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ONE EVENING 1945

We see Benjamin coming down the stairs He happens to
glance out a casement window He slows He can just

see part of a TAXI coming to stop at the gate

He moves

to the next landingwhere he can see a figure is
getting out of the cab The figure of a young woman

wearing a beret a dark coat and lace up boots

She

strides through the gate It takes us a moment to
recognize her the leggy thirteen year old girl is
gone replaced by a confident woman in her early
twenties with her red hair and her blue eyes she could
be no one else but DAISY Benjamin follows her progress
moving through the parlor watching her out the screened
windows She moves gracefully past the porch with its

swings The unnamed womans old dog smelling her
comes to greet her Daisy going around to the back of
the house Benjamin moving to the back door and just
as Daisy starts to knock Benjamin opening it
Momentarily startled she doesnt recognize him and
asks

156

DAISY
Oh excuse me is Queenie
here
BENJAMIN
Daisy its me Benjamin

She hardly can believe her eyes
DAISY
BenjaminOh my God its you

Of course its you

They embrace and theres a moment when the touch is not

just of old friends but something different and they
both in that moment recognize that things will never be
the same Daisy over-hugging him the way young
people do

DAISY (CONTD)
Benjamin how are you Its been
such a long time Theres so
much I want to know When did
you come back

BENJAMIN
Just a few weeks ago

DAISY

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0)
When I had left she was a girl
and a woman had taken her place

BENJAMIN

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (VO)

INT BACK STAIRS NOLAN HOUSE - TWILIGHT 1945

Benjamin and Daisy going up the back stairs

Everything in that moment
had changed between us

DAISY
I cant get over youre home

awhile my grandmother you

course you remember her she

passed away

BENJAMIN
I heard that Im sorry

DAISY
Ive been wanting to get some of
her things

They go into her grandmothers room

INT GRANDMA FULLERS ROOM - TWILIGHT 1945

Her grandmothers things are in boxes neatly stacked ina

corner waiting to be taken away

Daisy starts to go

through them Benjamin gives her a hand As they go
through things

DAISY
I cant believe I open the door
and youre actually standing

thereIt must be fate What do

they call it Kismet I read a
book about a man named Edgar
Cayce a psychic everything is
predeterminedI like to think
its fate What do you think
Benjamin

BENJAMIN
I dont know how it works but Im
sure glad it happened

They inadvertently touch the electricity of
friction both aware of the closeness they move ever
so slightly apart

DAISY

(nervously)
Have you been to New York Its
just across the bridge from me
I can actually see the Empire
State Building if I stand on my
bed Where have you been Tell
me everything The last time you
wrote you said you were in Russia
I always wanted to go to Russia
Is it as cold as they say You
wrote you met somebody did it
work out

BENJAMIN
(holding out)
Remember this

Hes comes upon the BOOK her grandmother had read to
them Rudyard Kiplings Just So She sits on the bed

Benjamin sitting beside her the two shoulder to
shoulder Daisy looking through the book and
reading

DAISY

This is the picture of Old Man
Kangaroo at five in the
afternoon

She looks at him

159 159
DAISY (CONTD)

You dont look like an old man
anymoreYou always said you were

different I think you must
be

He doesnt say anything The two of them sitting with
their backs to us like the old friends they areThey
touch acutely aware of their proximity and before it
can go any further

BENJAMIN
Are you hungry Would you like to
get something to eat

DAISY
I would love that

And the moments gone
EXT A NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT

And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion
and Daisy dressed for the night glides out a man
helping her and we see Benjamin a step behind getting
out of the car dressed to the nines hair slicked
elegant but nonetheless a step behind And we hear
Daisys voice from somewhere else

DAISYS (V0)
I danced for a man named
BallenchineHes a famous
choreographer He said I hada
perfect line They asked
Ballenchine to describe what he
did He said Im a carpenter
Isnt that amazing In one of his
rehearsals a dancer fell He put
it into the production Can you
imagine that in a classical
ballet A dancer intentionally
falling He isnt the only one
Agnes DeMille Lincoln Kirstein
Richard Pleasant Lucia
ChaseTheres a whole new word
for dance now its called

abstract
The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy another
man showing her inside Benjamin forgotten for the
slightest of moments at the door going after her

161 INT NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT 1945 161

A crowded New Orleans restaurant Daisy as a maitre d in
slow motion is showing her to a table Mens and even
womens eyes following her

DAISYS (V0)
They have torn up all the

conventions the straight up and
down style all the things that
bound dancersIts not about the

formality of the dancethe
classical structureits about
what the dancers feelingthere
are no rules the movement can be
tense or relaxed abrupt or
flowing carefree or somber it
may suggest love or hate
attraction or repulsion The
unexpected shifts of weight or
energy -- not just to shock but to
reinvent traditionputting the
familiar form to new and
unexpected uses Its so basic
Just you alone with your body

They reach a table A chair in slow motion swept out
for her to sit another man in slow motion putting a
napkin in her lap

DAISY (V0O)
They understand Americas vigor
and physicality -- they understand
the freshness of the American
people at their most modern at
their best

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0)
And she told me about this world
that she was so attracted to
names that didnt mean a thing to
meI didnt really hear very
much of what she was saying

We watch them at the table Benjamin listening
appreciating her her face aglow with the intensity and
the passion of youth Caviar is brought over
vodka She screws up her mouth not wanting to eat We

can sense hes telling her what hes learned from
Elizabeth Abbott how to savor it He feeds her a
spoonful They drink the vodka washing it down she
laughs delighted And we now hear what she is
saying

161

DAISY
(realizing)

Oh my god Ive been just talking
about myself

BENJAMIN
Im enjoying listening

She takes out a cigarette He instinctively looks for
matches a man gets there first lighting her cigarette
for her he watches the smoke curl around her

appreciating her

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
I didnt know you smoked

DAISY
Im old enough Im old enough
for a lot of things

BENJAMIN
Yes you are

162 EXT A NEW ORLEANS PARK - NIGHT

We see Benjamin and Daisy their silhouettes walking

through the park She puts her arm around his
shoulder being close to him
DAISY
I have to go back tomorrow I

wish I could stay

They reach a GAZEBO Not a soul around They stand
for a moment in the silence

DAISY (CONTD)
In New York we stay up all
night I eat breakfast ina

diner on Houston with red booths
and watch the sun come up over the
buildings theres always
something to do

Which is in stark contrast to Benjamins life Daisy
takes off her shoes

DAISY (CONTD)
Dancers dont need costumes or
scenery

And showing him what shes been telling him about she
does a dance for him

( )

DAISY (CONTD)
I could imagine dancing completely
naked
Daisy dancing for him While she dances
DAISY (CONTD)
Have you read DH Lawrence his
books were banned The words are
like making love
He stands hands in his pockets appreciating her she
moves closer to him She comes next to him and she
kisses him and when he doesnt respond she tries a

different tact

DAISY (CONTD)

In our group you have to trust
people not be afraid Sex
is a big part of it A lot of
the dancers are lesbians A
woman wanted me to sleep with
her

Hes quiet

DAISY (CONTD)
Does that upset you
BENJAMIN
Which part

DAISY
That someone wanted to sleep with
me
BENJAMIN
People should want to sleep with
you Youre very desirable
DAISY
Lets go back to the house or
get a room somewhere we can put

down your coat

She takes his hand as if to lead him to the dark of the

park Theres nothing hed like more but
BENJAMIN
Its not that I dont want to I
just cant not tonightIts
just not

162 DAISY
Im old enough

And despite how available she is how desirable she is

BENJAMIN
Go back to New York Daisy Be
with the people you are so fond
of You can only be young
once
DAISY
Do you think you are too old for
me Ive been with older men
And when he still doesnt respond Daisy rejected
takes up her shoes And she starts off Benjamin
coming beside her but theyre not really walking

together anymore and the time for them this time has
gone away

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0)
You only get so many chances to be
with someone I let her go
and I missed it

163 INT HOSPITAL ROOM NEW ORLEANS - MORNING PRESENT

bandaged standing in the doorway

Welcome home my friend

165 INT DELMONICOS STEAK HOUSE NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT 1945

The bar and restaurant crowded with men many with
various kinds of handicaps from the war drinking away

their demons And we see Benjamin and Thomas sitting at
a table thick steaks baked potatoes drinks at their
elbows

BENJAMIN

whiskey instead of brandy

THOMAS BUTTON

165

BENJAMIN
(smiles)
Are you still visiting the house
on Bourbon street

THOMAS BUTTON
(smiles)
Not for a long time

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0)
I told him about my life about
my time at war and he told me
how he had devoted his business to
making buttons for the war
effort

THOMAS BUTTON
The war has been kind to the
button industry we had gone
from making forty thousand buttons
a day to making two hundred and
fifty thousand We employed ten
times the number of workers We
were operating around the clock

And he quiets the sound of the busy restaurant And
after some moments Thomas tells him

THOMAS BUTTON (CONTD)
dont know how much longer I
have to live

BENJAMIN
m sorry to hear that Mr
Button

And it seems like he is about to tell Benjamin the entire
truth but he cant bring himself and instead

THOMAS BUTTON

hope you wont mind but
whenever its possible I would
enjoy your company

BENJAMIN

kitchen just to look at her

169
He does just that Looking through the round window
into the empty kitchen as if she was there those years

ago as

if she was still there

THOMAS BUTTON (CONTD)
The happiest day of my life was

Benjamin looks at him

THOMAS BUTTON (CONTD)

the steps to the dock Theres an old wooden deck chair
He helps his father sit in the chair And as his father
sits for the last time watching the lake

We see Benjamin with an elderly woman MS SANDERSON

standing at the railing of a mezzanine above the factory
work floor looking down upon the workers exclusively
women and exclusively white women making buttonsThe
women seeing him look up and theres a sudden hush

BENJAMIN
My name is Benjamin Benjamin
(for the first time)
Button

They stare up at him

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
As you know my father

It still sounds strange to him

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
My father Thomas Button
recently passed

After a moment

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
He asked that I take over the day
to day operation of Buttons
Buttons

They silently stare up at him

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Well I dont know the first thing
about buttonsand I dont know a
thing about business

178
BENJAMIN (CONTD)
(after a beat)
Buttons Buttons has been in my
fathers family for over 100
years It could not have survived
without people like you My father
asked me to tell you how much he
appreciated the hard work you put
in for him and his company for so
many years

Dead still And after a moment

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
I have decided that all of you --
his loyal employees will have a
share depending on your length of
employment in the ownership of
this factory his legacy

ONE OF THE WOMEN
Were the owners now

BENJAMIN
Thats about it

Theyre literally dumbfounded

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Mrs Sanderson will explain how
everything works and will answer
any of your questions

And with that he turns walking awayHaving given away
the store the workers in disbelief looking up at
him

BENJAMIN BUTTONS (V0O)

flowers in hand daisies gets out hurrying into The
Majestic Theater the marquee telling us CAROUSEL is
performing

INT THE MAJESTIC THEATER NYC - NIGHT 1947

Benjamin coming in late being shown to his seat And we
see the production of Rodgers and Hammersteins musical
Carousel with Mielziners seminal stage design as

choreographed by Agnes De Mille And we see the dancer

He sees Daisy in a robe coming through the room

DAISY
Somebodys looking for me

And she sees its Benjamin And rather than excited to

altogether pleased about him showing up

DAISY (CONTD)
Benjamin What are you doing

fantasy is not the reality

BENJAMIN

They look at each other in silenceand they simply
smile so glad to see each other after all the missing
years They embracefor some time and kiss As
people who havent seen each other and have thought
about each other for a very long time And it just
isno big symphonies no endless skiesjust two
people at a kitchen door in the middle of their lives
and the simplicity just that is what makes it real and
breaks your heart

BENJAMIN
Are you sure
DAISY

Yes

He turns to her They look at each other And they kiss
A kiss that has waited for thirty years A kiss that has
waited a lifetime And yes there is passion and
need but most particularly the awkwardness of people
discovering each other for the first time While he
gently tenderly kisses her undresses her

moment before she opens the gate The house has fallen

habit goes around the back porch to the kitchen

being played by a child with no skill banging as
much as anything And Daisy follows the sound of the
piano into the parlor

INT PARLOR NOLAN HOUSE - DAY 1990

And she sees his back just a boy of 12 now hunched
over trying to play the piano trying to play the
tune the woman had taught to him

DAISY
Benjamin

He turns at the sound of her voice There is no
indication he recognizes her at all

BENJAMIN AT TWELVE
Do you know this song

And he tries to play what he thinks is the song but is
nothing more than a child playing random notes

DAISY
You play really beautifully

She comes and touches his back He shrinks from her
touch
THE MAN
He doesnt seem to like to be
touched

And while he tries to play

THE MAN (CONTD)
The doctors said if they didnt
know any better he goes in and
out of states of recognition as
if he had the beginnings of
dementia

eyes
