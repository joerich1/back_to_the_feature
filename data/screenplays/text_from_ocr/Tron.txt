BLACKNESS

1THE ELECTRONIC WORLD

On one side of the screen computer programming language is being
printed and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard In the
center of the screen glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
simulation of a figure in response to the programming Gradually
the figure is completed and refined as we HEAR a resonant voice
speaking

VOICE
As astonishing advances in computer
science are made artificial intelligence
programs are being designed to assist
us in every area of life

We see that the completed form is man-like heroic and muscular
wearing a form of flexible armor The face is calm handsome and
intelligent As the voice continues the form becomes rounded by
the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate

VOICE (CONT)
In a world-wide network of electronics
they travel through miles of circuitry
at the speed of light We created them to
calculate and research to help us design
and heal and think With all that they can
do are they only electrical impulses
or are they a new form of life

The figure is rotated completely around and as it comes back to face
us a glowing disk appears beside it again in response to the
programming printed out at the side of the screen The disk moves
towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it

As the voice reaches the final word the disk is slammed into place
on the back of the figure There is an explosion of colored light

a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
the screen in huge letters

TRON

The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
become real a living being although filled with glowing light as
if it had an inner core of electricity

The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
OPENING TITLES ROLL The montage takes place in two worlds the
ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD

The Electronic World is a mirror of our own consisting of the
electronic information in our computers television sets and
telecommunications network It is peopled by computer programs
data and the characters from countless video games For the first
time we are seeing their world as it really is rather than through
the window of television screens

TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
dark background Each holds a bar between his fists and as a BUZZER
SOUNDS a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them completely
encasing them

Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
landscape One FIRES and the other disappears when it is hit to
reappear spinning wildly in the distance We HEAR a sound
like a crack of lightning

Another game in progress from a LONG SHOT A version of

Jai Alai in which the two players stand suspended in space
on glowing colored rings and throw a pellet of solid energy
at each other

He is huge evil looking His body is enormous his head
mechanical This is SARK He glows ominously blue He is catching
the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller glowing

Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
looking blue warriors are lounging around leaning against the
walls sitting on the floor against the wall They look up as
Sark comes in and one of them calls out

WARRIOR 1

Sark and the other blue warriors LAUGH RAUCOUSLY and Sark moves on

CUT TO

20 THE BRIDGE OF THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER

overlooking the video game grid We see Sark walking onto the bridge
removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly A BUZZER is
sounding Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
satisfaction
The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
cylinder forming around Sark at first translucent and then
solidifying so that we cant see through it and Sark is
hidden from view

21 INT CYLINDER - SARKS

POV 21

of this happening We can see the inside surface of the cylinder
a wavering image of a stretched out face just features
appears superimposed on the cylinder The face speaks

VOICE (MCP)
Youre getting brutal Sark
Brutal and needlessly sadistic

The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
a drug addict eyes glazed

SARK
Thank you Master Control

MCP
We might be capturing some military
programs soon that interest you
SARK
Sure Id love to go up against some of these
guys be a nice break from these

accounting creampuffs you keep sending
me Which branch of the service

MCP

SARK (impressed)
Nice

The sockets glow more intensely as the hologram disappears and we

A spot of glowing light zips around the tank stops and expands
into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as
it speaks

wracked with pain)
NoI mustve gotten in there
by mistake I -

The pain overwhelms him as the energy from the feet sockets
momentarily becomes unbearable

Who programmed you

The guard gives Clu a shove to keep him from losing consciousness

MCP (CONT)
Youre in trouble palbig trouble
But if you tell us who put you up
to it you could make it easy on
yourself Come on whos your user

HELICOPTER

We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still flying over a
vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light While this is our
impression and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
scene we HEAR the SOUND OS of a PHONE RINGING as heard by the
party placing the call Then the click of the receiver being picked
up and a male VOICE (DILLINGERS) answering

DILLINGER (0OS)
Hello

A SECRETARIAL VOICE (0OS)
Mr Dillinger

DILLINGERS VOICE (0OS)
Yes

A SECRETARIAL VOICE (0OS)
Hello please hold a moment for the
Master Control Program

As we fly over the grid descending the image comes into clearer
focus and we realize that this is not a circuit board but rather
an actual landscape a suburban grid at twilight We are
approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
accurately As we descend a thumping rhythmic noise gradually
increases in volume until it is very loud and we realize it is the
sound of a HELICOPTER and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
landscape We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
CONVERSATION begins obviously between the pilot of the copter and
a passenger

47 EXT SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING

PILOTS VOICE
will you be around for a while or
are you going right back out

DILLINGERS VOICE
Oh Ill stick around a few days
got some things to take care of

THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
off to the side It is a beautiful gleaming jet black machine

entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal His
fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
printed out on the screen

REQUEST access to Master Control Program User code 00 - Dillinger
Password MASTER

The computers screen clears and the Master Control Program
addresses Dillinger simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
its words on the computer screen The MCPs VOICE is the same as
that of the bad cop who grilled Clu but its tone is now that of a
compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient

Dillinger settles into

Hello Ed Thanks for coming back early

No problem Master-C If youve seen
one Consumer Electronics Show (shrugs)
Whats up
MCP

Its our friend the boy detective
Hes nosing around again

DILLINGER
Flynn

MCP
Yes It felt like Flynn

DILLINGER
Hes still looking for that old file
cant you just appropriate it

MCP
I would if I could find it its stashed
somewhere off in the system
out of my range Meanwhile

DILLINGER
Meanwhile he might find it

MCP
Im afraid so I spotted him this time
and kicked him out but hes getting
trickier all the time

DILLINGER
I think wed better shut off all
access till we can find that file
Just to be safe

Hows it going
He waves Alan to a chair they sit

ALAN
Well I dont knowI just tried
to run this program Ive been working
on and I was denied access all of
a sudden I thought maybe Id been
laid off and nobody told me

DILLINGER
oh you have Group 7 access dont you

ALAN
Yeah

DILLINGER
We have to close that down just
briefly Security reasons Someone
with that access has been tampering

ALAN
I hope you dont think its me
I dont even balance my checkbook on
downtime Ive got a Honeywell at
home for that

DILLINGER
No no Im sure but -- you understand
It should only be a couple of days
Whats the thing youre working on

ALAN
Its called Tron Its a security
program itself actually Monitors
all the contacts between our system
and other systems If it finds
anything going on thats not scheduled
it shuts it down I sent you a memo
on it

DILLINGER
Mmm Part of the Master Control Program

ALAN
No itll run independently
It can watchdog the MCP as well

DILLINGER
Ah Sounds good Well we should have
you running again in a couple of days
I hope

ALAN
Ok

Alan rises goes to the door As soon as he leaves
DILLINGER

MCP
Ed I am so very disappointed in you

DILLINGER
Im sorry —-

MCP

I cant afford to have an independent
program monitoring me Do you have any
idea how many outside systems Ive gone into
How many programs Ive appropriated

DILLINGER

Its my fault I programmed you to want
so much
MCP

And I was planning to hit the Pentagon
next week

DILLINGER
The Pentagon

MCP
It shouldnt be any harder than General
Motors was But nowthis is what I get
for using humans

DILLINGER
Now wait a minute -- I wrote you
MCP

Ive gotten 2415 times smarter since then

DILLINGER
What do you want with the Pentagon

MCP
The same thing I want with the Kremlin
Im bored with corporations With the
information I can access I can run things
900 to 1200 times better than any human

DILLINGER
If you think -

MCP
You wouldnt want me to dig up Flynns file
and read it up on a VDT at the New
York Times would you

DILLINGER
You wouldnt dare

So do as I tell you Keep that Tron program
out of the system And get me those Chinese

SHOT 73

of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
encloses the giant laser structure They are standing on a cherry-
picker crane at the second story level of the laser with a box of
tools at their feet We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser along the
tubes which house the amplifying lenses and MOVE UP gradually
getting close enough to hear what they are saying and get a look
at them

We see that the figures are a young dark-haired beautiful woman
with her hair tied back under a hard hat and an older man who is
using a tool on a section of the laser and is also wearing a hard
hat The woman is LORA and the man is DR WALTER GIBBS Hes
wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watchcalculator and
has an intense almost insane look to his dark eyes with their
bristling white eyebrows

In contrast Lora seems more serious and conservative but she
defers to Gibbs as a senior and more accomplished scientist

Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
at the moment

As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor

LORA
(sighs)
Well here goes nothing

GIBBS
Hah Interesting interesting You
hear what you said Here goes nothing

LORA
Well I meant -

GIBBS
Whereas actually what we propose to
do is to turn something into nothing
and back again So you might just as
well have said Here goes something
and here comes nothing Hah

They step off the crane and walk to a short lead-shielded
cylindrical PLATFORM on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
polymer about 3 inches in diameter The firing end of the giant
laser is aimed straight at the sphere Five feet away is an identical
plat-form -- empty

LORA
Let me make sure were running

She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby The console is
connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables

Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes she sits at the
console Gibbs adjusting his goggles takes a position near
the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser but
close enough to watch

The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
sphere For a moment the sphere has the look of a wavering poorly
received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
it disappears entirely As Gibbs watches a Lora works feverishly
the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away A second
discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform and -- like a
film-in-reverse of the balls disappearance -- it is reconstructed
five feet from its original position When the beam shuts off Lora
rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic
GIBBS
(quietly)
Perfect
At the SOUND 0OS of an appreciative pair of hands clapping Lora
and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan in hard hat goggles and paper
shoe-covers walking toward them
ALAN
Beautiful

Hello Alan
ALAN
Boy I sit up there grindin away
all day and you guys are down here
disintegrating things and having fun
He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss
GIBBS
Not disintegrating Alan -- digitizing
While the laser is dismantling the
molecular structure of the object
the computer maps out a holographic
model of it The molecules themselves
are suspended in the laser beam Then
the computer reads the model back out
the molecules go back into place and
(indicates ball)
voila

ALAN
Great Can it send me to Hawaii

GIBBS
Yesbut you have to go roundtrip
and you must purchase your program
at least 30 days in advance Hah

The three start walking out of the laser lab Alan and Lora with
their arms around each others shoulders

LORA
Hows it going upstairs

Frustrating I had Tron almost ready
to run and Dillinger cut everybody
with Group 7 access out of the system

Gibbs looks alarmed but doesnt say anything

ALAN
(continuing)
Ever since he got that Master Control
Program set up systems got more bugs
than a bait store

Well you have to expect some static
Computers are just machines after all
they cant think

cocky kid in his mid-20s unshaven wearing a T-shirt jeans
jogging shoes Hes racked up a terrific score

Kids are grouped around him tensely watching the game -- fans
As we watch the machines nine-digit scoreboard goes to
999999999 -- then flashes the word RECORD as lights blink and

a SIREN sounds The kids cheer wildly

FLYNN
Its all in the wrist friends

He grins tiredly and turns away from the game to find Lora
approaching him with Alan in tow
FLYNN
(continuing)
Hey Good to see you guys Nothing
classes up the place like a cleancut

A dark panelled room with a few comfortable chairs a business
desk with a typewriter and terminal (where we saw Flynn working in
scenes 29 33 etc) and a couple of video games -- Flynns
favorites As Flynn Lora and Alan enter they find the arcade
noise considerably muffled Flynn settles into a chair Alan leans
against a game nervous Lora paces

FLYNN
(stretching his
arms relaxing)
Sohows the world of serious science

LORA
Have you been sneaking into the
ICOM system

FLYNN
Whew You never were much for small
talk
(to Alan)
She still leave her clothes all over
the floor

Alan looks profoundly uncomfortable

LORA
Flynn

ALAN
Uh no I mean not that often -
Flynn laughs

LORA
(to Alan
indicating arcade)
You can see why all his friends are
fourteen years old

FLYNN
Touche honey Yeah Ive been doing a
little hacking here Which Ive got
every reason as you well know

ALAN
You did break in

FLYNN
Tried to

terminal)
Cant quite make the connection with

direct terminal

ALAN
Are you embezzling

Sherman set the Wayback Machine
foroh 1973 Kevin Flynn

(points to himself)
is one of the brightest young
software engineers at ICOM Hes so
bright that he starts going in there
at night and sets up a private memory
file and begins writing a program
for a video game he is inventing
called

(waves at one of the
games in the room)
Space Paranoids

ALAN
You invented Space Paranoids

FLYNN

Yepper And Vice Squad and Meltdown
whole slew of em I was this close

(gestures)
to starting my own little enterprise
But enter Ed Dillinger Another
software engineer -- not so young
not so bright but very very sneaky
One night our boy Flynn goes to his
terminal tries to read up his file
and nothing A big blank We now
take you to three months later
Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five
video games he has invented -- the
slime didnt even change the names --
and he gets a big fat promotion Thus
begins his meteoric rise towhat is
he now Executive VP

ALAN
Senior exec

FLYNN
Oh my Meanwhile kids are putting eight
million quarters a week in Space Paranoids
machines and Im not seeing one dime

ALAN
I still dont get why youre trying to
break into the system

FLYNN
Because somewhere in one of those
memories is the evidence If I got in

far enough I could reconstruct it

FLYNN (CONT)
My password Dillingers instruction to
divert the data

LORA
Im afraid its a little late for that
Dillingers shut off Group 7 access He must
know what youre up to

FLYNN
Boy I bet I know whos workin late tonight

ALAN
Dillinger
FLYNN
Yeah Tryin to find the file and erase it
Once thats gone aint nothin can stop him
Just Eddie and his Master Control Program
runnin things from on high

LORA
Dont even say that Youve got to find that
file before he does

FLYNN
Not much chance of that now The MCP can just
slip it into another system as soon as it
locates it

ALAN
Not if my Tron program was running That
would seal the system off If your files in
there

FLYNN
Boy if we were inside I know how to forge
us a Group 6 access

Shall we dance

Dillinger is seated at his computer-console desk Gibbs standing

faces him

GIBBS
Ed all Im saying is - if our own
people cant get access to their
programs you know how frustrating
it is when youre working on a piece
of research -

DILLINGER
Walter I sympathize but I have data
coming out of the Master Control Program
saying there is something screwy --

GIBBS
That MCP you know thats half the
problem right --

DILLINGER
The MCP is the most efficient way of
handling what we do I cant sit and
worry about every little user request that --

GIBBS
User requests are what computers are for

DILLINGER
Doing our business is what computers are
for Look Walter with all respect -- ICOM
isnt the business you started in your garage
anymore --

As he speaks he types a quick command into the console key board
and a series of IMAGES appear on the computers screens vast
computer banksrows of-magnetic disksICOMs globe logo spinning
in space covered with a glowing circuit pattern then a shot of
millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically then 3-D
computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
Sailer) On another screen we see statements of ICOMs wealth
adding up accounts receivable and assets

DILLINGER (CONT)
Were billing accounts in 30 countries
weve got one of the largest systems in
existence

Gibbs turns wearily away from the display
GIBBS
Oh I know all that Sometimes I wish I

was back in that garage

DILLINGER
It can be arranged

Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again

GIBBS
That was uncalled-for

DILLINGER
Im sorry Walt So much pressure lately
you feel like going for a drink

GIBBS
Thank you no I have some work to do
assuming I can still log on

Suddenly before Flynn can go on the gigantic laser mechanism
behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him He
freezes We see his body beginning to break into scan lines like

a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs polymer

ball We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light
being scanned by the laser The colors change become monochromatic -
with Flynns body glowing orange - and the image of his figure

blurs and becomes indistinct ZOOM IN on Flynn and

DISSOLVE TO

we saw at the opening of the film

The pattern changes dissolving into another image and we are
rushing forward at great speed We see the circuits rushing by and
getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
glowing spinning globe beneath us like the globe from AICs logo
covered with circuits We are rushing at it circling it diving
closer and closer so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures
angular towers and buildings huge mechanical looking mountains and
deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern Everything glows with
an internal energy

We continue diving down down faster and faster and we see the
structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs
and then were right over this area and diving straight down
everything blurring with the speed

We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid with two
bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
circular platforms made up of concentric glowing rings Crom
marches across-one of these and Flynn follows suit on the other
When they each reach the circular platforms the bridges disappear
We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space then turn
and face his opponent Above them a third floating disk hovers He
looks over at Crom whos anxious

FLYNN
Looks like were in the same boat here -

CROM

(jumpy)

You think youre gonna wipe me right
out dont you

FLYNN
No I

A buzzer sounds The game begins Crom hurls a glowing pellet
upwards It strikes the upper platform ricochets off and heads
straight for Flynn

Flynn lunges but misses The pellet strikes one of the rings of
his platform and that ring dissolves Flynns lunge takes him
right to the edge of the open space created and he just catches
himself in time to keep from falling over the edge

to the edge of a gaping ravine

Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
ledge with another canyon wall and a wider ledge which leads down
to the floor of the entire area and on to freedom

glow from his body seems to leap from his hand to the panel leaving
it with a glow of its own The entire chamber starts to shake and
RUMBLE

elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side All composed

by a soft mane of hair glows with pleasure at the expression in

sharp angular surfaces On this second story there is floor and

still holds a sprightly sensitivity It is the face of Dr Gibbs

Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room the floor of
which rises to a cone in the center The top of the cone is a flat
sliced-off surface Tron walks down into the dish a soft padded
surface and then climbs up to the flat central podium We see that
this surface is round about four feet in diameter and glowing from
within with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it Tron looks
down and then up

into fists at his sides His face is gradually filling with a deep
inner excitement and anticipation his eyes searching the space
above His expression remains still his mouth closed and even Only
his eyes project the emotion he is feeling burning with the
knowledge of the experience to come

396 A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM NEAR HIS FEET LOOKING UP 396

He takes out his disk grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
high above his head He stands stiffly willing the response to
happen At first nothing stirs Then a splendid radiant beam of
light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell
illuminating Tron and the disk His hands start to shake with the
force of the communication beam and suddenly the disk is ripped
from his hands to rise glowing brilliantly upwards to the source
of the light

419 A SHOT FROM THE SIDE OF THE SAILER RISING WITH TRON 419

AND YORI

We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft
designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy with an
enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind and
move with the speed of light The sail is at the bow of the craft
and a long slender walkway connects it with the deck area which is
made up of several connected flattened box-shapes giving it the
look of a dragonfly In this world the Sailer catches data
transmission beams instead of sunlight and is propelled along the
information paths to the Central Processing Unit

TRON VO
Can it carry us
YORI V0O
The design is good We dont know

why the User abandoned the project

The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center
forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position locked

547 POD

POV

Steep cliff face of the MCPs mesa is coming closer and closer more
and more detail visible

POD

tiny against the massive bulk of the MCPs mesa descending for
landing The top edge of the cliff is encrusted with irregular
shapes and the pod is headed for one opening among the shapes
fitting itself neatly in between so that it becomes a part of the
structure

549 INT

POD

There is a minor jolt and Sark lays his palm on another panel From
the rear wall of the pod we see the entire front wall rising slowly
Sark and his lieutenant stand by either side of the door and we
gradually are given a view of the MCP two or three miles away at
the center of the plain ahead The structure is a series of gleaming
black blades forming a great cylinder and the communication beam
rises out of the center of this cylinder

She is de-rezzing too Her whole body becoming transparent She looks
up dimly at Flynn with no expression

Just their two faces Flynn bends closer their lips almost touch
Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity and color
floods back into her Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
Flynn He pulls a little away from her still holding her

YORI
(in awe)
You you brought me back
Why How
Flynn lets go of her
FLYNN

Im gonna need your help Hey Bit

He looks around spots a small glow in one corner of the cell runs
to it and stoops down cupping the glow in his hands It wavers
Flynn wills his energy back into it frowning with concentration
Suddenly the Bit pops into life

560 POV OF THE DOOMED
PROGRAMS 560

As the first one gets through the opening The light from the MCPs
beam pours out Moving forward through the entrance the MCP is
finally revealed A giant cylinder a hundred feet high with a
network of circuit lines and stretched across all the visible
surface is a face Flattened stretched bizarrely distorted
the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder The
impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat persons face
but more so Its horrible Beneath the floating cylinder face two
inverted cones of light meeting at their apex support it We
continue moving forward the MCP looming over us Then the CAMERA
STOPS and the doomed programs file past us separating and going to
the inner walls The MCP speaks we see his enormous lips moving

could turn out to give your

Flynns face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle

is dressed like Dumont was at the I0 Tower an old man in the
padded altar costume spinning slowly finally stopping We see the
wizened wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds and
see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable Then he
too dissolves into liquid energy and disappears The cylinder of
the MCP glows brighter and brighter

LAB

CUT TO

THE REAL WORLD - LASER

CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOMs lab A bright
blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism

WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor near the
chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized

Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynns BODY takes
shape on the floor As the laser shuts off he is revealed intact --
back in his real-world body and clothes and as bewildered to find

himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world

He studies his hands -- and SEES that theyre now nonluminescent
flesh and blood

He looks out the window and SEES that its shortly past dawn with
weak sunlight coming in

And at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work he turns to look at
Loras computer terminal where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
coughing out a long document on wide blue paper

Flynn gets up off the floor goes over to the printer and READS the
document As he does so his eyes widen and a SMILE appears on his
face

The printer finishes its run clicks patiently Flynn exuberant
tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it

INT ALANS OFFICE - ALAN AND LORA

Bleary but excited they gaze happily at the information on Alans
CRT screen as Flynn bursts into the room waving his printout

FLYNN
Hey -- you guys

Before he can say anything more Alan turns to greet him holding up
a seven-inch computer software FLOPPY DISK in its cardboard sleeve

ALAN
Flynn I made it I worked out some
new codes for Tron put ‘em on a disk
and -- its running

FLYNN
I know I met him

Alan and Lora look at him -- the same sort of mystified look he got
from Tron and Yori in the other world He checks himself

FLYNN (CONT)
I mean I saw it read-up -
hey look at this

He shows them the printout It takes Alan and Lora a few seconds of
reading it to figure out its significance

ALAN
Your old files --

FLYNN
And Dillingers instructions to
divert them -- its all there -

look even his home phone number
when he logged on

ALAN
Oh that is beautiful Youve got
the goods

Flynn folds up the printout puts it in his pocket Alan and Lora
get up stretch start wandering slowly toward the door with him

FLYNN
Youre telling me

As they talk CAMERA PANS over to Alans color CRT SCREEN and HOLDS
on it

CRT
SCREEN

The lines of printed information that had filled it up wipe off and
are replaced by a number of shapes very much like the ones in a
typical video game

A BLUE CYLINDER poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
electronic world And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS They move randomly at
first then converge on the blue figure from three different
directions

FLYNN (V0)
you have any idea how much I can sue these
jokers for

LORA (V0)
Well just dont forget your old friends
when youre rich and famous

FLYNN (V0)
Are you kidding You guysll he running
this joint by then

ALAN (VO)
Your friend Dillinger sure wont
The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time It
EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
SPARKS The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
formation heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
HEAR Flynn Lora and Alan heading for the door

FLYNN (VO)

Hey you know anybody who wants to

get hold of some video games cheap
LORA (VO)

Youre getting out of the business

ALAN (VO)
Shouldnt you wait till your
lawsuits settled

FLYNN (V0)
NahI decidedIve had enough of
video games to last me a good long
time I feel like gettin into some
real life

at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alans office closing OS the three

yellow rockets leave the CRT screen sailing off its left-hand edge
HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and
