TITLES OVER BLACK

1942 WORLD WAR II THE UNITED STATES BUILDS A MILITARY
BASE AT THE EASTERN-MOST POINT OF MONTAUK NEW YORK

IT SPANS 278 ACRES IT IS CALLED CAMP HERO

1972 THE COLD WAR AN ALLEGED SERIES OF TOP-SECRET
EXPERIMENTS BEGIN TO TAKE PLACE AT CAMP HERO

DECEMBER 1980 CAMP HERO IS SHUT DOWN FOR
UNDISCLOSED REASONS

TO THIS DAY ITS RECORDS REMAIN CLASSIFIED
EXT MONTAUK SKY - NIGHT
We FADE UP on the night sky Dark clouds swallow the stars

We hear a LOW-END RUMBLE It sounds almost like thunder only
it is somehow more alive Like the growl of an unseen beast

We TILT DOWN to find
CAMP HERO MILITARY BASE It is an imposing cement building in
a dense forest A LONG-RANGE SEARCH RADAR DISH rotates atop
its roof Around and around
Superimpose titles
CAMP HERO MONTAUK NEW YORK
OCTOBER 5 1980
TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN
INT CAMP HERO - TUNNEL SYSTEM - NIGHT
We move down a long windowless corridor
There is a STEEL DOOR at the end
We draw closer to this door
And closer
And
WHOOM THE DOOR SUDDENLY EXPLODES OPEN THE HINGES SHRIEK
A SCIENTIST staggers out into the corridor He is gasping for
breath A Hazmat suit melts off his body We can see some

skin beneath it is burned shredded bloody His entire left
arm is missing
He collapses to the floor Twitches Stills Dead

His eyes remain open Frozen in a look of sheer terror

We continue past him

Moving into

A LABORATORY

A DOZEN MORE SCIENTISTS lie dead on the ground

They too are burned many also missing limbs Some heads

We survey the lab around them There are BULKY COMPUTERS
MYSTERIOUS ANALOG EQUIPMENT and most striking of all

An ISOLATION TANK an upright metal cylinder filled with
water A tangle of electrical wires connect this tank to

A METAL DOOR FRAME The door leads nowhere there is just
empty white space behind it The base of the door is on fire

We watch as this fire begins to spread across the lab
The flames grow hotter

And hotter

And

HISS FIRE SPRINKLERS kick on

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

HISS LAWN SPRINKLERS kick on

We are now in a 1980s SUBURBAN CUL-DE-SAC Quiet Calm
A row of uniform houses wind up the tree-lined street
station wagons and other family cars fill driveways TV
sets flicker behind drawn curtains a few dogs bark

We hear the VOICE OF A YOUNG BOY Dramatic intense

MIKE (0S)
Do you hear that Listen

We focus on a TWO-STORY HOUSE at the end of the cul-de-sac
The mailbox reads THE WHEELERS
MIKE (0S) (CONT’D)

Something is coming something
hungry for blood
INT WHEELER HOUSE - MIKE’S ROOM - NIGHT
A GROUP OF BOYS 12 years old play DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS

They sit in a circle their knobby knees buried in carpet A
map is spread out between them along with an empty pizza
box canned cokes and the all-important DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS
MONSTER MANUAL

MIKE WHEELER 12 is the “Dungeon Master” He is a cute moppy
haired kid classically good looking except for a BIRTHMARK
on his left cheek

MIKE (CONT’D)
A shadow grows on the wall behind
you swallowing you in
darkness it is almost here

The other boys lean forward Riveted We survey them

LUCAS CONLEY 12 playing as a knight He is very small but
his loud mouth more than makes up for it

DUSTIN HENDERSON 12 playing as a dwarf He wears glasses

The boys scramble to look at the dice when --
WHOOM The bedroom door swings open
The boys look up to find

KAREN WHEELER late 30s Mike’s mom Short blonde hair
conservative blouse blue jeans hiked high above her waist

MIKE
Mom we’re in the middle of a

She taps her watch

KAREN

They reach
THE LIVING ROOM

Mike’s dad TED 45 is watching “CHiPS” Or trying to The
signal is terrible a snowstorm of static obscures the image

He smacks the TV

MIKE
Dad don’t you think --

TED
(not even listening)
I think you should listen to your
mother DAGGUM PIECE OF JUNK
He smacks the TV again The static flares
BACK UPSTAIRS IN MIKE’S ROOM

Lucas Dustin and Will stuff belongings into backpacks

WILL
Does the seven count

LUCAS
It was a seven
Will nods

LUCAS (CONTD)
Did Mike see it

Will shakes his head

LUCAS (CONTD)
Then it doesn’t count

THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Dustin and Will bound down the stairs

Lucas doesn’t follow He peers through a cracked door into
NANCY WHEELER’S ROOM This is Mike’s sister 16 girl-next-
door pretty She is on her bed in pajamas a phone in hand

fingers twisting its cord slender legs kicked in the air

Lucas angles himself in such a way that he can see Nancy in
the reflection of her vanity mirror

NANCY
I know I know but -- I don’t
think so -- yeah he’s cute but --
Barb -- BARB -- listen to me --
Nancy turns around on her bed Spots Lucas in the mirror

Her smile drops

NANCY (CONTD)
The HELL LUCAS GET OUTTA MY ROOM

She leaps out of bed and storms over to him

LUCAS
I’m not in your room --

NANCY
(into phone)
One of Mike’s loser friends --

LUCAS
-- Not technically --

WHAM Nancy slams the door
EXTINT THE WHEELERS GARAGE - NIGHT
Lucas explodes into the garage Excited

LUCAS
She knows my name

Dustin and Will are mounting bikes Mike is seeing them off

WILL

LUCAS

NANCY
MIKE

DUSTIN
Shes cool You lost your chance
Should’ve gone for her when she had
braces and no boobs

LUCAS
I’m playing the long game

DUSTIN
Oh yeah I’m sure a growth spurt
will really do it for you Lucas

The boys bike out of the garage arguing as they go Mike
takes his hands off his ears He can’t help but smile Then

BZZ2ZZ The light above him begins to flicker Strange
Mike switches it off and heads back inside

We return our gaze to the light
It sputters back on And

EXT MONTAUK NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

WHOOSH The boys bike home

Their handlebar lights wink in the night And good thing
because it’s dark out here as in very dark Montauk is
coastal but it’s more akin to living out in the country

Lucas peels off from the group

LUCAS
See ya ladies

DUSTIN
Kiss your mom ‘night for me

Lucas flips him the bird and bikes up a driveway towards his
TWO-STORY HOUSE Almost identical to Mike’s a little larger

Will and Dustin bike on in silence for a beat then
DUSTIN (CONTD)
Race to my place Loser gets a

comic

WILL
Any comic

DUSTIN
Yeah --

Will has heard enough He starts pedaling Fast

DUSTIN (CONTD)
Shit

Dustin pedals in pursuit But he’s already behind And
A FEW MINUTES LATER
Will whizzes past a house at the far end of neighborhood
He waves at Dustin Now fifty yards back
WILL
Ill take your X-Men Uncanny two-
six-nine
Dustin stops Out-of-breath
DUSTIN

(really bummed)
-Man

EXT FOREST ROAD - LATER
Will is now biking along an empty forest road All alone
He lives much further out than the rest of his friends It is
even darker out here and quiet unnervingly so Only the
sound of cicadas and a gentle breeze to keep him company
He bikes past a LARGE METAL FENCE A warning sign reads

AUTHORIZED VEHICLES ONLY NO TRESPASSING

We’re near Camp Hero
Will suddenly notices something strange the hair on the back
of his arms is standing straight up It’s like he’s in the
middle of a massive electrical storm And perhaps he is
A LOW-END RUMBLE reverberates above him He looks up
Sees nothing but darkness Clouds over the moon

He looks back down His eyes shoot wide

A TALL FIGURE STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD

Will spins the wheel -- loses control --
He veers off the road --

And explodes into --

THE FOREST

The bike flies down a steep hill and --

CRASHES Will flies off the bike He skids rolls eats dirt
As he lies there on the ground gasping for air he hears

STRANGE GUTTURAL SOUNDS COMING FROM BEHIND HIM

He pushes to his feet and turns to the sound

Foliage shudders The sounds grow Something is coming
Will abandons his bike --

And runs

EXT MONTAUK BEACH -- NIGHT

Will bursts out onto the beach

The wind whips his clothes Waves crash the shore Roaring

MOMENTS LATER
He races up a dune toward a house His house

It is small lower class and falling apart after decades of
abuse from the battering ocean winds But it offers safety

INT THE BYERS HOUSE -- NIGHT

Will slams the door shut behind him and bolts the lock
A shaggy mutt CHESTER races to greet him

Will ignores him calls for his family

WILL
MOM JONATHAN MOM

There is no answer

He checks his MOM’S BEDROOM His BROTHER’S BEDROOM

No one is home He is all alone

INT THE BYERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Will scrambles back to the living room window

He cups his hands to the glass and peers out into the yard
It is dark Murky Quiet A gust of wind blows and
Day-old laundry flutters on a clothes line to reveal

THAT FIGURE AGAIN JUST STANDING THERE AMONGST THE BILLOWING
LAUNDRY WE CAN’T MAKE OUT ANY FEATURES BUT ITS PROPORTIONS
SEEM OFF ITS HEAD IS TOO LARGE ITS ARMS TOO LONG ITS
BODY SWOLEN AND BENT IN A STRANGE TWISTED SHAPE

Another gust of wind The clothes flutters again and

The Figure is gone

Will pales His heart in his throat

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Will rips a phone off the kitchen wall Dials 911 But --
It does not ring Just hums with LOW-END STATIC

WILL
Hello HELLO --

Will pauses He hears something on the other line But not a
voice it is that GUTTURAL SOUND he heard in the forest
The pitch rises and falls making a series of strange sounds
Words It is as if the figure whoever whatever it is
is somehow speaking to him through the phone receiver

Behind him Chester begins to GROWL at the front door

Will lowers the phone And looks back at the door

A SHADOW fills the crack at the base of the door

And then somehow impossibly the chain bolt begins to slide
open as if drawn by an invisible hand The metal SHRIEKS

Will drops the phone and --

EXT BYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

WHOOM Will explodes out the back screen door

He sprints into an OLD WOODEN SHED and --

INT SHED - MOMENTS LATER

WHAM He slams the shed doors behind him Breathing hard
His eyes dart Searching for something

The shed is cluttered and dark lit only by a NAKED LIGHT
BULB hanging from the ceiling The bulb buzzes flickers

At last he spots it

AN OLD REMINGTON RIFLE DUSTY HANGING ON A WALL MOUNT

Will yanks it down retrieves a few AMMO SHELLS from a work
bench and loads the rifle as fast as he can which isn’t
very fast at all he is so scared his hands sweat and shake
THUD THUD THUD HEAVY FOOTSTEPS ECHO THEN GUTTURAL NOISES
Will looks back to the shed doors They shudder and moan

And then slowly ever slowly they begin to yawn open

Will finishes loading the rifle He snaps the chamber shut
and aims it at the door The rifle trembles in his hands

The shed doors slowly yawn open the rest of way
It whatever it is enters the shed

We still do not show it in full but we catch glimpses of it
in the flickering light Misshapen withered pale slick

Will doesn’t fire He just stares Paralyzed by fear
The hairs on his arms stand up again

His ears begin to drip blood

And then his nose

He fights tears

WILL
--P-please --

A HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEKING SOUND SUDDENLY FILLS THE SHED

WE DON’T SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO WILL WE JUST WATCH THAT NAKED
DANGLING LIGHT BULB IT GLOWS BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER AND

BRIGHTER FILLING THE SHED WITH OVERWHELMING WHITE LIGHT WE
THINK THE GLASS OF THE BULB IS GOING TO SHATTER BUT THEN --

The TERRIBLE SHRIEKING sound abruptly stops
The bulb dims Returning to normal wattage
We pull away from the light

The shed is empty

Will has vanished

Hop rubs his arms Getting cold now Enough beauty for now

He flicks his cigarette to the sand

INT HOPPER’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - A LITTLE LATER

EXT MONTAUK POLICE STATION - MORNING

An American flag flutters in the wind High on a flagpole
We are outside the MONTAUK POLICE STATION It is quaint As
in really quaint If the sign out front didn’t read
POLICE you’d probably mistake it for a gift shop

A CHEVY BLAZER POLICE CAR squeals into the lot

Hopper exits Dragging on another cigarette

Still hungover

EXT MONTAUK POLICE STATION - MORNING

Hopper lumbers inside Beelines for the coffee machine

DEPUTIES CALLAHAN and DEPUTY POWELL look up from a game of
five card draw their cowboy boots kicked up on their desks

The mood here is casual to say the least

DEPUTY CALLAHAN
You look like shit Chief

HOPPER
Your wife looked worse when I left
her
Hopper begins to make himself a cup of coffee
His secretary FLORENCE 61 approaches Pad and pen in hand
FLORENCE
Tell your boys to get their feet
off the desk This in’t a barn

Hopper snaps his fingers The Deputies roll their eyes but
oblige

Florence adjusts her glasses and consults a note pad

And she doesn’t look happy
INT HOOPER’S OFFICE - MORNING
WHAP WHAP WHAP Type hammers slam ink onto a police report
A single ominous word forms one letter at a time “MISSING”
Hopper looks up from the typewriter He now has on a pair of
reading glasses which lend him a more earnest look His

desk however shatters the illusion it’s cluttered with
PAPERS and MUGS and CANDY WRAPPERS like the desk of a child

Joyce paces Dragging on cigarette She’s on edge So far out
she might just fall right off

JOYCE
I’ve been waiting an hour --

HOPPER
And I apologize again --

Joyce hesitates This is an uncomfortable subject

JOYCE
He was in Philly last I heard That

nothing to do with this He doesn’t
give two shits about that boy

Hopper rummages around his desk Unearths a pen and a pad

HOPPER

Joyce sits down She snuffs her cigarette in an ashtray Then
she looks back up at Hopper Her eyes are bloodshot Glassy

JOYCE (CONTD)

responsibility he doesn’t want He finds his composure
nudges his glasses back on his nose and resumes typing

tunnel They wear gloves gas masks plastic overshoes

INT CAMP HERO - LABORATORY - DAY
The Agents enter the laboratory Or what still remains of it

MEDICAL OFFICERS IN HAZMAT SUITS place bloody body parts into
plastic bags mop up blood and remove charred equipment

AGENT ONE removes his gas mask
He has slicked back hair Piercing green eyes

AGENT TWO
Sir your mask --

Agent One ignores him He walks over to the ISOLATION TANK

He opens its cylindrical roof A ladder slithers down into
water A TANGLE OF WIRES and ELECTRODES float on the surface

This tank once held someone Something
He turns back to the others

AGENT ONE
Where is Eleven

AGENT THREE
We don’t know

Agent One considers

His gaze shifts to a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA on the ceiling
INT CAMP HERO - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

An ENGINEER toggles through SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE

The Agents stand behind him Making him nervous

ENGINEER
Okay this is it

The Engineer hits play
Low definition video shows us the LABORATORY from last night
only now we are back in time the scientists are still very

much alive huddled around that strange metal door frame

There is a confusion of activity shouting followed by a
VIOLENT BURST OF A LIGHT It looks like an explosion Then

HISS Static engulfs the surveillance image

Beneath this static we glimpse SHADOWED MOVEMENT But just
for a few frames And then the static dissipates to reveal

The scientists dead on the ground Blood everywhere
One of the scientists climbs to his feet Still alive
He staggers out the door and into the corridor
We are back to the beginning of our story
The video snaps to BLACK

ENGINEER (CONTD)

There’s nothing else All the
cameras -- they just cut out

AGENT ONE
Go back Ten seconds

The Engineer wipes sweat from his forehead Rewinds

AGENT ONE (CONTD)
There

The Engineer pauses the tape

AGENT ONE (CONTD)
Go forward Four frames

The Engineer complies One frame Two Three Four
There is someone SOMETHING captured on the video It is
obscured beneath static but we see enough to know that this
is the Figure that Will saw last night For the first time
we glimpse its small black eyes buried in pockets of pale
withered flesh
AGENT TWO
(Low)
-What the hell is that
A beat
AGENT ONE
Eleven will know
(beat)
Find her
Agent One strides away The door slams shut behind him

Agents two and three return their gaze to the monitor
Frightened The frozen video waves and undulates

Making the figure appear to bend stutter
Making it seem almost
Alive

ACT THREE
EXT WOODS - DAY
A YOUNG GIRL 10 emerges out of the woods
She makes an immediate impression on us Her hair is buzzed
close to the scalp Her feet are bare Her skin is pale She
wears a tattered white hospital gown spattered with BLOOD
She is more like a wild animal than a child
EXT EMPTY ROAD - DAY
The Young Girl pads barefoot down an empty road
She sees a RUN-DOWN RESTAURANT in the distance
A rusted sign reads “BENNY’S FISH ‘N FRY”
EXT BENNY’S FISH ‘N FRY - DAY
The Young Girl approaches the restaurant
She stands on her tiptoes and peers into a smudged window
BENNY HAMMOND late 40s lumbers past the window carrying
THREE PLATES OF FISH AND CHIPS He has leathery skin sleeve
tattoos and a greasy apron wrapped around his waist

He drops the plates off at a table of ELDERLY REGULARS

They chain-smoke speak with thick islander accents

Benny you hear ‘bout Earl and the
chickens

BENNY

The chickens What chickens
REGULAR 2
Earl see he wanted to bring a
crate of chickens ‘board Mundo’s

Benny guffaws as Regular 2 continues his yarn

But the Young Girl is only interested in their food

Shes starving

EXT BACK OF BENNY’S RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER
The Girl sneaks around the back of the restaurant

There is a GIANT ROTTWEILER lying out front of the back door
Its fat belly rises and falls Rises and falls It’s asleep

The Girl watches it for a moment Makes sure it doesn’t wake
And then sneaks inside
INT FISH ‘N FRY - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

The Young Girl finds herself in a greasy kitchen FRENCH
FRIES sizzle in a deep fryer Oil SPITS She startles

She hurries past and pushes through a door into

A STORAGE ROOM

A RUSTY FREEZER hums against the back wall

The Girl yanks back on the handle It yawns open

Her eyes shoot wide The shelves are packed with FRESH FISH
She snatches up a DEEPWATER COD So big that she can hardly

hold it in her tiny hands She turns it over onto its side

studies it smells it Has she never seen fish before

She bites its fat glistening belly and --

Freezes again Listening

BENNY (0S)
Sticking with Narragansett Earl

She grabs up as many fish as she can carry and --

INT FISH ‘N FRY - KITCHEN

The Girl charges back into the kitchen Fish in arms
Benny spots her Shouts

BENNY

The Girl bolts for the back door She knocks over the DEEP
FRYER and sends a RAIN OF HOT OIL splashing onto the floor

Benny leaps away Narrowly avoiding the oil

EXT BACK OF BENNY’S RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

WHOOM The Girl explodes out the screen door and --

Crashes to a halt THE ROTTWEILER stands in her path Awake
It bares its teeth and snarls angrily and --

WHAM Benny grabs the Girl by the shoulders

BENNY
Think you can steal from me boy

Benny whirls her around His expression promptly softens as
he realizes that this is no boy at all It’s also not a girl
either not exactly at least not like any he has ever seen

Regulars 2 drawn by the commotion steps outside

REGULAR 2
What’d you catch there Benny

Benny looks back at the Young Girl She writhes in his arms
He notices her hospital gown Spattered in BLOOD

BENNY
-I got no idea

They find Chester pacing in front of the shed Whimpering

HOPPER

Joyce leads Chester back to the house by his collar
But Hopper doesn’t follow Not yet

His eyes turn to the shed

INT SHED - MOMENTS LATER

Hopper opens the shed doors The wood groans

Even though it is now day it is still dark in here

Hop flips a light switch The naked light bulb hums to life

He walks up to the rifle wall mount The rifle is of course
missing He inspects the mount There are fingerprints in the
dust Someone was here recently

BZZZZ THE LIGHT BULB BEGINS TO FLICKER

Hopper turns and looks up at the light It fluctuates
growing bright then dim then bright then dim then --

WHOOM THE LIGHT CUTS OUT LEAVING US IN DARKNESS

WE HEAR A FAINT GUTTURAL SOUND LIKE SOME KIND OF GROWL

Hopper looks around The hell is that coming from

HOPPER
That you buddy You hungry

Hop removes a flashlight from his utility belt clicks it on
and slowly sweeps its beam across the darkness He makes out
nothing But that sound whatever the hell it is persists
It grows louder Louder LOUDER STILL Overtaking all sounds
The hairs on Hop’s slowly stand up And then --

The beam illuminates an APPROACHING FIGURE

Hop reaches for his gun but --

Deputy Callahan steps into the light

DEPUTY CALLAHN
You deaf I’ve been callin’ you

Hopper is too shaken to respond He looks back at the light
bulb It flickers back to life Returning to 48 Watts

The strange guttural sound is gone Like it never was

DEPUTY CALLAHN (CONT’D)
Jesus Chief Your ear

HOPPER

DEPUTY CALLAHN
Your ear

Hopper touches his ear It’s bleeding
EXT SHED - BYERS YARD - MORNING
Hopper upends the vial Dumping the pills onto the ground

DEPUTY CALLAHN
You sure you’re alright Chief

HOPPER

He shoves the empty vial back into his jacket
He strides to the Byers house Moving fast
Callahan struggles to keep up
HOPPER (CONTD)
I want you to call Florence have
her get a search party together as
many volunteers as she can muster
flashlights too --

DEPUTY CALLAHAN
Think we got a problem here

Hopper doesn’t answer Uncertain He turns and looks out at
the woods The sun is falling The sky is a bruised purple

He continues into the Byers house Callahan follows

But we don’t Instead we return our gaze to the shed We can
hear that GUTTURAL SOUND again Low but definitely there

We move

INTO THE SHED

The light bulb hums and flickers again Growing brighter

And that is when we see it There is something strange on the
far wall It looks almost like a SPOT OF BLACK MOLD Only it
is throbbing ever so slightly and slowly but surely

Spreading

Tears spills down her cheeks Mixing with the blood

She looks back at the agents Rolling on the floor in pain

ELEVEN
Bad

And then she turns
And runs

BEGIN ACT FIVE
EXT MONTAUK BEACH - TURTLE COVE - NIGHT
A BONFIRE RAGES ON THE BEACH FLAMES LICK THE SKY
A GROUP OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS are silhouetted against the
fire drinking smoking various substances screwing around
“Call Me” by Blondie blasts from an idling pick-up truck

We find Nancy and Barbara in the crowd

They look out of their element bobbing awkwardly to the
tune Nancy takes a sip of her beer Grimaces Not a drinker

She holds the beer out for Barb Barb waves it off

BARBARA
I don’t see him -- we should go

NANCY
We just got here relax

Nancy motions to TOMMY H 16 heavyset scraggly half-beard

NANCY (CONT’D)
What about Tommy H

BARBARA
Ew
NANCY
Oh come on -- he’s cute And I

heard he broke it off with Carol --
Nancy shrieks as a PAIR OF HANDS snatch her from behind

It’s Steve Of course it’s Steve His eyes are bloodshot and
flagging He’s drunk or stoned or both Probably both

STEVE
Where’s Mrs Kreitzberg

NANCY
Shut up

Steve grabs her hand and pulls her away

NANCY (CONT’D)
Where are we going You just got
here Steve STEVE

But Steve doesn’t stop He breaks into a sprint dragging
Nancy with him She laughs giddily her hair blowing in the
wind She glances back at Barb with a wide-eyed smile Sorry
Barbara sighs All alone now

She looks down at her watch And waits

EXT FOREST ROAD - END OF NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
Mike looks at his watch Waiting

He hears VOICES He looks up to find Lucas and Dustin
his way They pull up next to him

MIKE
What happened to ten minutes
LUCAS
Parents were watching MASH No
way past
DUSTIN

Mike passes Dustin a WALKIE TALKIE
MIKE
Stay on channel six just in case
but no splitting up or anything
stupid like that okay
Dustin nods “Okay” Mike climbs onto his bike

LUCAS
Where are we going

MIKE
Mirkwood

And with that Mike pedals out of the neighborhood
Lucas and Dustin share worried looks
And then race after him
EXT MONTAUK BEACH - TURTLE COVE - NIGHT
Steve and Nancy race across the moonlit beach
The bonfire burns dimly behind them Far away now
Nancy is out-of-breath
NANCY

Steve Can you just tell me where
were going Steve --

biking

STEVE
Right here

Steve shoves Nancy onto a sand dune She shrieks laughs
Steve drops on top of her Begins kiss her all over

Nancy is overwhelmed Her laughter fades

NANCY
Steve hey can we just talk for
a -- a second

Steve starts to pull her sweater off She tries to stop him
but it’s too late He tosses the sweater off into the sand

Nancy covers her bra with her arms Shy -- and cold

NANCY (CONTD)
It it’s freezing

Steve isn’t listening He unbuttons her jeans and yanks them
down below her waist Nancy’s breathing quickens Her heart
pounds

Steve removes a condom from his pocket

NANCY (CONT’D)
Steve I I’ve never

Steve still isn’t listening Or doesn’t care

He tears open the condom wrapper

EXT MONTAUK BEACH - WIDE SHOT

Their silhouetted bodies writhe in the moonlight
Waves CRASH the shore

EXT BEACH - TURTLE COVE - NIGHT

An EXPLOSION OF LAUGHTER

A very drunk Tommy H is urinating into the raging bonfire
Smoke coughs coals sizzle everyone think this is hilarious

Everyone but Barbara She stares in disgust
MOMENTS LATER
Barbara charges down the beach Call out into the darkness

BARBARA
NANCE I’M LEAVING NANCE

No answer Fuck it

EXT SIDE OF THE ROAD - NIGHT

Barbara storms back to her car It’s parked on an empty road
INT STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara leaps in Turns the keys

The engine revs coughs

BARBARA
Come one come on

Barbara turns the keys again Again And --

THE RADIO BLASTS TO LIFE BARB NEARLY JUMPS OUT OF HER SEAT
The radio begins to cycle rapidly through the stations The
songs are warped garbled static-y The speedometer rises
and falls the blinkers flash the dashboard light stutters
Barbara looks down Her arm hairs are standing straight up
She quickly shuts off the engine and --

Everything stops Returning to normal

Barbara stares in confusion Breathing hard And

SMASH THE WINDOW BEHIND HER SHATTERS

She screams and --

EXT VOLKSWAGEN - NIGHT

The VW headlights grow brighter and brighter so bright they
blind our vision We hear a SHRIEKING SOUND pitched so high
it’s almost painful Just when we think we can’t take it
anymore the sound fades

The headlights flicker and dim

The station wagon is empty

Barbara has vanished

EXT FOREST ROAD - NIGHT
VROOM Jonathan rides the moped up to his house

He dismounts and bounds up the porch As he does we turn our
gaze to the shed Chester is once again pacing by the door

Back and forth Back and forth Back and --

INT BYERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jonathan swings open the front door

He finds his mom sitting cross-legged on the floor She is
working on a MISSING PERSONS POSTER for Will Bold red
letters read “HAVE YOU SEEN ME”

PHOTOGRAPHS OF WILL are strewn across the floor

Joyce looks up at Jonathan Bleary eyed

JOYCE
Anything

Jonathan shakes his head “No”

JONATHAN
You

JOYCE
Hopper’s out looking a bunch of
people are but

Joyce fights back tears Returns to the photographs

Jonathan sits down beside her and looks over the photographs
They have been artfully taken by him over the years There is
a photo of Will building a sand castle riding a raft
eating a hotdog at Coney Island visiting the city

Jonathan fights back tears His voice emerges low choked

JONATHAN
-I’m sorry

JOYCE
Sorry What’re you sorry for

Jonathan says nothing Doesn’t feel he needs to
Joyce takes his hand Squeezes it

JOYCE (CONT’D)
Hey This wasn’t your fault baby
you hear me You hear me

Jonathan averts his gaze

JOYCE (CONTD)

He’s gonna come home soon I know

it I know it because I feel

him I feel him in my heart
(MORE )

JOYCE (CONTD)
He’s close He’s close You believe
me Jonathan right
Jonathan finally looks at his mom And nods

Joyce smiles faintly She holds up a pair of photographs one
in each hand Will on the raft Will at Coney Island

JOYCE (CONTD)
What do you think

Jonathan considers Chooses Coney island

JONATHAN
I I always liked this one
Joyce smiles softly
JOYCE

--Me too
An emotional beat Then
The kitchen phone BLARES TO LIFE
Joyce and Jonathan look up sharply News
MOMENTS LATER - KITCHEN
Joyce grabs up the phone Her voice tense strained

JOYCE
Yes -- hel--hello

There is no answer But she can hear the sound of LOW
BREATHING on the other end

JOYCE (CONTD)
Lonnie Hopper

Still no answer

JOYCE (CONTD)
Who is this

Jonathan stands up Getting worried now
The SOUND OF BREATHING grows louder

JOYCE CONT’D)
Who is this Answer me

At last we hear a voice It sounds very far away

It is the voice of a boy

DISTANT VOICE
«Mom

Joyce pales Tears rush to her eyes

JOYCE
Will will

Jonathan races over to his mom
JOYCE (CONTD)
Where are you baby Talk to me
WILL WILL
But Will’s voice is now gone In its place
Another voice GUTTURAL INHUMAN Shifting in pitch
JOYCE (CONTD)
WHO IS THIS WHAT HAVE DONE WITH MY
BABY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
Silence Then --
A HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK ERUPTS FROM THE RECEIVER
Joyce gasps in pain and drops the phone She looks at her
hand Her palm is seared and her arm hair is standing
straight up
She backs away from the phone Her eyes wide with dread

Jonathan grabs up phone His voice shakes

JONATHAN
Who is this WHO IS THIS

But the phone line is now dead
Joyce slumps down to the floor
She begins to sob

VOICE (PRE-LAP)
HEELLLLP

EXT UNKNOWN - NIGHT
Barbara stumbles out onto the beach
Her face is pale and blood pours from her nose and ears

She crashes to a halt Looks around for help Desperate

But there is no bonfire No kids No party Yet somehow
impossibly she can hear the sound of music of kids talking
laughing Only it all sounds far away Like a distant memory
A dense fog has drifted in from the Atlantic and the waves
roll in slowly much slower than normal as if the world now
moves at quarter speed The wet sand is covered in more of
those strange throbbing growths and the sky is shrouded in
dark clouds Electric blue lighting flashes streaking the
sky and --

Barbara hears something Something wet Guttural

She turns And pales Obscured beneath the fog

A HORDE OF SHADOWED FIGURES TALL DISFIGURED

One of them walks on all fours

They are coming this way

Coming for her

She screams

And

EXT MIRKWOOD - LATER

WHOOSH Our boys bike onto “Mirkwood”

They scan the trees Calling out

MIKE
Will WILL

LUCAS
WILL

DUSTIN

I’ve got your Uncanny 269
There is no response but the chirp of cicadas
They bike on in silence for a little while
Lucas grows impatient
LUCAS
Why are we even here My mom says
there’s a whole search party --
MIKE

But they don’t know Will and he
doesn’t know them He knows us

LUCAS
So

MIKE
So what if he’s scared and --

A SHADOWED FIGURE SUDDENLY APPEARS IN THE MIDDLE OF ROAD --
RACING ACROSS THE PAVEMENT -- RACING RIGHT FOR OUR BOYS --

Mike’s eyes shoot wide -- he spins the wheel to the left --
Too fast -- he loses control -- skids --

Dustin and Lucas crash into him --

They all tumble -- and --

WHOOM SLAM INTO PAVEMENT

They roll to stop Dirt coughs

LUCAS
What what was that Mike

Mike doesn’t respond Instead he climbs to his feet turns
around and looks back at the darkened road behind them

The SHADOWED FIGURE is standing there Staring right at him

Mike is wide-eyed Scared Slowly very slowly he raises his
flashlight and aims it at the figure The beam illuminates

A young girl Bald head Wild eyes Fish ‘N Fry T-shirt
ELEVEN

She looks at Mike He looks at her

Their gaze holds a beat And then

A LOW GROWL RUMBLES Mike hears it

He looks up at the night sky

INT BYERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Joyce and Jonathan hear it too

They look out the window with tear stained eyes

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Hopper’s radio crackles to life

CALLAHAN (0S)
(filtered )
You hear that Chief

Hopper doesn’t respond His eyes fixed on the sky
We follow his gaze
RISING UP
Over his head
AND UP
Over Camp Hero base
AND UP
Over the shadowed trees
AND UP

To the dark silhouetted clouds in the sky above

A LOW GROWL RUMBLES just like in the opening scene But this
time it grows louder and louder shaking our eardrums

An ELECTRIC BLUE light flashes behind the clouds
The storm is no longer coming
It’s here
