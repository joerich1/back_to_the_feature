INT COACH MOTORWAY MORNING

A large empty coach all dull beige seats and wood veneer
makes its way along a stretch of motorway

INT COACH MOTORWAY MORNING

At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger His eyes
closed head drooped Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the
bridge of his nose Its no use Chris 25 cant sleep He
pulls up a set of head phones puts them on and presses play
on his MP3

INT COACH MORNING

Long shot from the front of the coach the drivers gruff
face to the left empty seats filtering away from camera
Chris head peaking above a back seat We hear the music
from his MP3 begin to play Its Noel McKoys Brighter Day
a northern soul track thats reminiscent of Motown and
comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye

The track will play over the following opening scenes the
credits fading subtly in and out in white text

EXT STREET MORNING

We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent
through Dudlowe a sprawling new town built in the fifties to
house the east end after the Second World War

those morning streets He blows on his hands to warm them up

SHIFTY

Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a
fence making a short cut

INT TREVOR HOUSE BATHROOM MORNING
Birds eye view on Trevor Perry average looking thickset

pallid skin lying beneath the surface of the bath water
holding his nose

facial burns on the side of her face He injects the cocaine

paper with a scribbled address He finds the right house He
stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3 Our
soulful soundtrack comes to an end He pulls down his head

INT TREVORS HOUSE KITCHEN BATHROOM DAY

On Jasmines kitchen floor just outside the connecting
bathroom are stacked a variety of toiletry goods The sounds
of scrubbing and movement echo out Jasmine her dressing
gown grubby and soaked cleanses scrubs and cleans the
emptied bathroom like a woman possessed Shes purging her
haven washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum

echoing down the clinical looking hallway

INT VALERIES FLAT HALLWAY DAY

We follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and
colour Valerie who leads the way is considerably smaller
We open into the front room and Valeries revealed for the
first time At 55 with long arms book-ended by bony hands
and a sculptured face she smacks of an ageing Goth and is
clearly an old hippie her brain starched by LSD Sleeping
cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards

A BEAT
Valerie looks towards Chris

room Sleeping felines Chintzy ornaments of cats He picks
up a framed photo of her daughter Loretta in better days
fresh faced before the scars ready to take on the world He
looks slightly shocked to see this

Cut TO

Chris sits in a sunken armchair and looks around the room
He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair He moves
his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor not

moving just solid as if frozen It dawns on Chris that all
the cats in the room are stuffed

Chris sits back in the chair suddenly from next door the
deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the
wall Its so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat
ornaments rattle

INT VALERIES KITCHEN DAY

tea He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen He
places a hand on her arm

SHIFTY
Shell come back one day

They carry on making the tea

INT VALERIES FRONT ROOM DAY

The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall A
fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink
Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before
Val Chris watches with intent He almost cant believe what
hes seeing She opens the cellophane and places down a small
yellowy lump Then carefully she fashions the can into a
smoking utensil At that moment one of her cat ornaments
falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass Valerie
walks over picks up the china tabby and places it carefully
back on the side She sits back down clearly distressed by
the music

Were tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to
her mouth and takes a hit a small grimace etched across her
lips She gestures with her hand offering Chris some

CHRIS
No no Im fine thanks
though

a grotty front room On the TV a violent movie scene plays
out the sound turned down A wiry looking 18 year old

films images A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left Shifty
