Thats just one example My
reporting has made a difference

Let me guess retail sales of

gone through the roof

The school dumpsters used to

overflow to the point where the

The city added an extra weekday

Remember how you struggled through
that whole facts of life talk and
then found out I knew more than
you

DAD
Youre way ahead of me again

TED
(proving it)
It was the year of the rhizopus
rot Grandpa almost lost the farm
You sacrificed your dream to go to
the prize hog festival And in the
end you saved the peaches and you
didnt have to slaughter your sow

DAD
The lesson being

TED
Sometimes you have to do stuff you
dont want to do Its all part of
growing up And it usually works
out peachy in the end

DAD
Im getting so good at this

Dad chuckles but Teds still moping

TED
You guys are my parents

Of course we are

TED
They didnt want me when I was
born Why should I care

if theyre dead

Your mother was well a two-bit
stripper There was no place for a
baby

I guess

DAD
They did do one great thing They
gave us our boy

TED
Yeah

DAD
Be a sport How bad could spring
break in Los Angeles be

TED
I guess we could go to Disneyland
or something

DAD
Think of it as a rite of passage to
manhood

TED

Like one of those National
Geographic specials with the
topless chicks

DAD
Whatever helps you cope
TED
I guess its better than having
tribal patterns carved in my face

emerges

from the pool wearing nothing but a g-string Her skin

shimmers from the reflection of the pool lights
Rivulets of

water stream down her body She reaches for a towel
and pats

her body dry An incredible aura seems to surround her

Separating her from the other spectacular beauties
weve seen

already

Ted lowers the binoculars Entranced

Ted and Charlie awkwardly hide the panty halves behind
their
backs
TED
We were just--
BUTLER
--I completely understand sir

Good night
The Butler leaves Ted glares at Charlie Who shrugs
CHARLIE
A couple of boys fighting over a

GINGER
And who IS Ted Nelson

Teds not sure how to respond He smiles awkwardly

GINGER (CONTD)
Is he a small town boy destined to
live an ordinary life with an
ordinary wife and a tiny house with
a boring old white picket fence

The hamburger life Now he can defy it
GINGER (CONTD)

Or do you have a taste for the good
life Ted Its in your blood

TED
I always knew there was more I
felt it

GINGER

Then remember you are the heir to

staff of literally thousands
Multiply everything you ever
imagined by a million and you still

UNCLE BILLY
Wellfor one thingI think its
despicable that we exclude so many
women that only fit our western
notion of classic beauty

The world is a big beautiful
place We can open new markets in
Africa and Asia Imagine the Dali

Mafioso in his efforts to be hip He turns to the

Heaven magazine Preaching with an evangelical

PRINCIPAL MERKIN
This my friends this is not

propose this publication be banned

We cannot afford free speech if it
excises the moral fiber of this

If that were true this would be
one seriously constipated town
Most guys in Xenia have been
looking at naked girls in Heaven
since they were old enough to
figure out their dads hide it under
the mattress

A bit of an UPROAR from the crowd WOMEN eye their
HUSBANDS
suspiciously Julie makes a point

Isnt it true Principal Merkin
that you only care now because
Heaven is suddenly too close to

Indeed it is Miss Conroy I make
no bones about it Heaven has
gone too far

I wouldnt want to name names Mr

At least its not another 4-H

Amen to that

Their heads are very close together A conspiratorial
TED
Look at us Its one oclock in the

in a smoky nightclub hoping to
catch our principal with some big

summery dress And lets it fall to the floor Shes
completely naked and absolutely gorgeous

Ted gasps Hes been around dozens of naked women by

Being naked is no big deal It has
nothing to do with emotion nothing
to do with love You can be around

in his belly

What are you doing

My job Back off Benedict

Uncle Billy steps into the shadows as Ted looks out at

crowd Hes petrified But he takes a deep breath and

the courage to explain

TED

(CONTD)

The only man I called Dad owns a
little grocery store in Xenia
Ohio He learned a lot of cool

stuff from my

Grandpa who was a
peach farmer in his day Grandpa
knew the right thing to say in
every situation and it usually
involved peaches My dads a lot
like him And he taught me you
have to focus on the peachy side of
life not the pits

Dads eyes are filled with tears Hes never been so
proud

TED (CONTD)
There was a time when canned
peaches were the hottest greatest
thing ever invented
It was like a little taste of
summer anytime you wanted Grocery
stores couldnt keep them in stock
they were so popular And even
though other canned fruits like
pears plums and pineapples have
come along people still need to
know they can get their canned
peaches on the same shelf
whenever they want them Its
comforting you know It fulfills
their expectations

The stockholders are listening Uncle Billy grins
nervously
Unable to believe Ted is pulling this off

TED (CONTD)
Youre probably wondering if
theres a point to all this and I
guess its just that I goofed last
month I not only moved the canned
peaches I restocked the shelves
with kiwi guava and mandarin
oranges in heavy syrup I
challenged peoples expectations
And you cant do that to your
customers So I ask you for one
more chance to fix things and give
our readers back their canned
peaches

The stockholders APPLAUD enthusiastically giving Ted a
standing ovation Ted turns to Uncle Billy

TED (CONTD)
Thanks for teaching me an important
lesson What makes a family is
love not blood

jealousy when considering the young

for which we criticize him

Someone hands Ted a copy of Julies article He reads
