suddenly drops his hands to his side The organist
discontinues and the voices of the soloists trail off

LEWIE
Spruance would you like to show
me where its marked smearing
here
(hitting at the score)
because I swear I dont see

it
JOAN
Sorry I didnt know I was
LEWIE

Also Id be mildly content if I
could have a little less delirious
self-appreciation and some small
regard for remaining somewhere in
the vicinity of the goddamned note

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42391 2

He returns his attention to the score While Joan
grumbles to Helen a late arriving member of the chorus
(EDDY REVERE) can be seen taking his seat amongst the
others
JOAN
I wasnt smearing

HELEN
Sssh come on now

JOAN
No Im telling you this is
personally motivated Since I
moved out hes been doing this
making remarks and being
incredibly pricklike

LEWIE
Now if our lovely soprano would like
to stop grumbling for a moment Id
like to take it once again

JOAN

(under her breath)

See what I mean

LEWIE
Pardon me
JOAN
I said fine lets do it again
LEWIE

(with a cold stare)
From the beginning please

He signals a down beat and they resume somewhere near the
top of the duet

INT CAMPUS PSYCHOLOGY BUILDING - ON ADELE IWO JIMA
WATANABE BLISS - NIGHT

She speaks emotionally hoping to solicit sympathy
ADELE
He never says Honey I love you
youre doing a great job I
dont feel he respects me as a
person and Im just not that happy
with the stature of our
relationship
( )

THERAPIST (0S)
Uhm hmm I hear you

ON POST-GRADUATE MFCC THERAPIST
seated behind a desk in a large deserted classroom

THERAPIST
Now I want you to look at Harry
and tell him how you feel

She turns her gaze to EUGENE EARL AXLINE alias HARRY
BLISS He sits in an adjacent chair an abject hostage

Discomforted by her flinty stare he glances away to
the window where the faint sounds of the CHORAL REHEARSAL
can be heard
ADELE
I feel like hes not plugged into
my needs and Im not getting
enough positive feedback

Harry shakes his head shifting about uncomfortably
ADELE
See look at him shaking his head

THERAPIST
Well lets see what he wants to
say here Harry how do you feel
when she brings out this material

HARRY
How do I feel I feel she just
overheats on every little side

issue and when I go to try and
communicate with the woman for
some unknown reason she doesnt
believe a damn thing I say

ADELE
Oh thats a lie

HARRY
See what I mean

ADELE
No you know what this whole thing
hinges from He came to rent a
building from me which is now his
place of business

HARRY
So what hes not interested in
that thats not what hes asking

(to Therapist)

See what she does She wants to
dig up and haul out miscellaneous
things thats got nothing to do
with this I mean I agreed to
come here okay but I have to
tell you Iwo Jimas got a lot of
faulty notions in her head about
me that

ADELE
Alright there Right now
Thats another thing I want to
interject

HARRY
Pardon me I was making a
statement here

THERAPIST
Yes lets try and hear each other
out if we can Go on Harry

HARRY
Well I forgot the upshot of what
I was saying but

ADELE
Okay this syndrome where Ive
asked him to address me by my
given name and he just goes on
ignoring my wishes

THERAPIST
Alright Look at him and really
tell him how you feel about that
ADELE
I dont want you to ever call me
Iwo Jima again
THERAPIST
Thats a legitimate request isnt
it
Harry begrudges a slight nod

ADELE
If you cant call me Adele dont
call me anything at all

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42391 5 5
THERAPIST
So Can you look at Iwo Jima
Harry and tell her
She darts a confused frown at the Therapist

THERAPIST
Better yet can you take her by
the hand and say I hear what
youre saying

Reluctantly he reaches over and takes her hand mumbling
something which though indistinct causes Adeles
features to pucker with emotion and brings her to the
edge of tears

THERAPIST
Good Thats good because
theres a lot of love here isnt
there (stealing a quick look
at his watch)

Joan moving with nervous alert approaches a Mercedes
sedan parked next to an Econoline van Placing her key
in the lock she notes a flyer on her windshield She
removes it glancing briefly at this heading in bold
type WOMEN - DONT LIVE IN FEAR A low RUMBLING sound
causes her to lift her gaze over the top of the car
where an attack shepherd (DUKE) slowly unsheathes his
teeth and fixes her with a threatening stare through the
closed window of the van

Her eyes drop down to the legend on its door panel
House of Bliss Shepherds - Peace of mind - Twenty-Four
Hours A Day - Call 7-A-T-T-A-C-K

untoward She reaches to a wall switch turns on the

The living room has been completely savaged Pictures
have been pulled from the walls books have been swept
from the shelves chairs are upended and area rugs lie
rumpled and dislocated A vase of flowers atop a grand
piano is overturned and water from it stains the polished
surface

Her gaze moves to a bank of windows overlooking a garden
patio The glass pane in one of them is broken and the
window stands partly open

ON Joans stunned reaction as she fearfully scans the
room Then she suddenly reaches to the front door opens
it and disappears into the hallway shutting the door
after her

15 INT JOANS APARTMENTLIVING ROOM - DAY 15
A detective (MELVENOS) moves about glancing at the
devastation Joan seated on a couch addresses him

(In the bg Helen Dextra stands on her crutches near the
piano and beyond her a FINGERPRINTER dusts for prints

around the frame of the broken window)

MELVENOS
You sure nothing of value has been
removed from the dwelling

JOAN
No nothing Thats whats so
disturbing I mean why would
someone do something like this

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 5391 8

MELVENOS

mess here

(poking his toe

at some debris

on the floor)
It kinda looks like somebody
doesnt like you doesnt it

JOAN
What do you mean somebody doesnt
like me
The Fingerprinter interrupts

FINGERPRINTER

partials and a bunch of smears
MELVENOS
Check out the bedroom
As he moves to the hallway leading to the bedroom

JOAN

You think this is someone I know

Helen hobbles INTO VIEW seating herself in a nearby
chair

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42391 9 MELVENOS
Anyone whose displeasure you
mightve incurred in some way
Now thoroughly paranoid she frowns down at the carpet
scanning her memory for the commission of some past
offense

MELVENOS (CONTD)
For instance just the other day
we had a homicide concerning a
dispute over a parking space
JOAN
Who could it be

MELVENOS
Youre not married I take it
Her mind is still off searching for enemies and she
fails to respond

situations

INT JOANS APARTMENT - DAY

20 INT ANDYS HOUSELIVING ROOM - DAY

Joan is seated at the piano playing Ravels Reverie
She breaks off as she sees a dark young man (BALTO) move
past the living room window She resumes playing until

her attention is once again drawn to the window where

a middle-aged Hispanic woman SOCORRO moves past in the
opposite direction with a young man who now carries a
suitcase She rises and crosses to the windows to see

them get into a gaudy low-rider and begin backing down the
driveway

21 EXT ANDYS HOUSE - DAY

Joan hurries out of the house and runs down the drive-
way toward the low-rider calling out
JOAN
Socorro Wait a minute I want
to talk to you
The Low-Rider comes to a stop Joan approaches the pas-
senger window and leans down to Socorro
JOAN
Excuse me Socorro but do you

Joan straightens up sighing angrily and looking up at
the house

JOAN
Well this is just glorious
he low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap-
ears onto the street Joan moves to an electric box
top a metal column at the edge of the driveway She
resses the button and looks at the gates They remain
pen She steps over to the gates and tries to close them
manually The locking device fails to engage and a
portion of it falls off into the bushes

As she leans down to look for the fallen part a pickup
truck can be seen parked down the street The back of the
drivers head (BUTCH GABLE) can be seen and on the side

panel of the truck are the words Canyon Tree Surgeons
ANOTHER ANGLE

Giving up on the gates Joan turns and moves with evident

reluctance up the driveway passing a three-car garage in

which her Mercedes and another car hidden under a trap can
be seen

INT ANDYS HOUSEBEDROOM - NIGHT 22
TRAILER MUSIC Joan is asleep on the bed Lying beside
her is a fireplace poker and a mallet meat tenderizer

Across the dark room a trailer of Blood and Kisses plays
on the TV screen The scantily-clad woman previously
seen on the bus stop poster backs away from a steadily-
stalking camera Her eyes widen in the familiar
expression of helpless terror and as she opens her mouth
to scream
Joan flinches and sits up She turns the TV OFF which
descends into a wooden console At that moment there
is a VOICE from outside the bedroom window

BUTCH

Hey Andy

In the vicinity of the bedroom window a man in work
clothes can be seen pounding on the glass as he continues
yelling
BUTCH (CONTD)
Its Butch Get your ass in gear
and say hello to your old drinking
buddy
She calls loudly out to him
JOAN
Andys not here
He moves to the glass facade and peers inside looking
for the source of the voice

BUTCH

JOAN
Shes out of town and there
happens to be several other people
in here trying to sleep so

22A

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42391 20

JOAN
Im sorry but if you dont leave

Patrol

BUTCH
Well fuck you honey

He cups a hand over his crotch and sticking his tongue
out flicks it in an obscene manner across his lips

JOAN
Tch where does she find these

people

BUTCH
I was just trying to be nice
(moving backwards
to the flower
bed)
Go ahead an call em bitch I
dont give a shit
He leans down picks up a dirt clod from the flower bed
and throws it toward the window
BUTCH
Ill just come back and kick your
ass in for you

INTEXT ANDYS HOUSELIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Joan moves along the windows with her weapons in hand

watching as Butch wavers erratically up to the driveway

where the previously seen pickup can be seen She
waits until he gets in and drives off then she moves
back into the bedroom

INT ANDYS HOUSEBEDROOM - NIGHT

Joan pacing about in nervous distress She stops
abruptly throws her weapons onto the bed and moves
purposively to her handbag Rummaging through it she

finds the House of Bliss flyer unfolds it and looks at
the reassuring photograph of Harry and Duke

EXT ANDYS HOUSE - CLOSE ON DUKE - DAY

Posed in an alert stance Duke breaks into a run loping
gracefully across the lawn to Harry where he assumes a
sitting position upon the command

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42391 20A

(Al) 23
HARRY
Duke platz
(to Joan)
Always the name first and then
the command

She stands off to the side repeating the command and
studiously writing it down in a small notebook

23
HARRY
Now in regard to any aggressor
seeking to give youa bad time I
want to show you what you can
expect from a dog of this caliber

He takes hold of the dogs muzzle lifting the lips to
reveal the large scimitar-like canines
HARRY
Here we have the dogs arsenal so
to speak The animal is trained
to apply pressure to specific

points of the body until the bone
is more or less crushed
(releasing the
muzzle)
If the attacker is bearing a
weapon of any kind be it a gun a
club a knife or what-have-you
the dog will excuse me for
saying
(politely
indicating
his crotch)
automatically go for the
testicles
JOAN
Oh god what if I dont want him
to do that
HARRY
You want him to do that
JOAN
No I just want him to scare
someone
HARRY
Believe me this will scare them
as well as incapacitate their mind
and any ability to maneuver
against you

JOAN
You know I have an extremely
sensitive reaction to dog dander
so maybe I shouldnt

HARRY
Let me ask you something I like
to get a general picture of the
individual situation Im working

with

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42391 22 He pauses to light a cigarette making a quick reflexive
appraisal of her contours as he does

HARRY (CONTD)
Are you married single living
alone or with some other party

JOAN
Im in the process of a divorce

and I moved up here because my
apartment was burglarized and
(suddenly
mistrustful)
But Im not entirely alone
theres a housekeeper here and
several friends

HARRY
Well the hills are hit heaven as
far as burglaries go And right
up on Mulholland is where they
found the fifth victim of the
Westside Slasher

JOAN
No please dont tell me about
that

HARRY

Believe me I know what youre up
against being an attractive and
I take it unattached woman such
as you are
(flicking his
cigarettte away)
But were going to remedy that
situation right now and get you
to feeling as safe as a little
baby alright
(indicating her
notebook)
Whatve we got there so far
JOAN
(reading her
notes)
Ober platz geh am platz
bringen komm sitz fuss fahrt
and blieb

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42291 23

HARRY
Well thats enough for a start on
the basic control commands
He scans the grounds for signs of something we as yet
know nothing of

HARRY (CONTD)
Now lets do a little work with

the assailant

24 EXT ANDYS HOUSEEXPANSIVE GARDEN AREA - ON JOAN AND 24
HARRY

She holds Duke on a short lead and as they move along a
wooded area of the grounds he leans in close directing
her in confidential tones

HARRY
Alright now Joan give him the
command Duke wachen sie
JOAN
Duke wachen sie
HARRY
Good The dog is now on alert

As they walk Harry glances about impressed with the
appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds
HARRY
This is really a nice piece of
real estate youve got here
JOAN
(tense and
distracted)
Its not mine its my sisters

HARRY
Oh its your sisters
(pause)
And wheres she

JOAN
(looking down
at Duke)
Am I doing this right Shouldnt
I be prepared for something

HARRY
Never look at your dog

( )
MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42991 24

JOAN

Never look at your dog Okay

They move forward a few feet when Harry now slightly
behind Joan makes a covert hand signal in the direction
of some trees several yards ahead of them

June in a padded attack suit suddenly jumps out from
behind the trees assuming an aggressive stance and
emitting a repertory of menacing sounds

JOAN HARRY
Oh my God Duke fasse
Duke responds immediately lunging toward June pulling
Joan along with him June screams and starts to run
away Harry moves after Joan yelling ahead to June
HARRY
Dammit June dont exhibit fear
until I tell you
Seeing the dog still in pursuit June ignores the command
and as Duke continues to tow Joan behind him
HARRY (CONTD)
Get him under control now Joan
JOAN
Iam
(struggling
with Duke)
Good boy be nice

HARRY
Give him the off command

JOAN
I forgot it You tell him Duke
stop

He hurries up behind her grabbing her around the waist
to anchor her and addressing the dog
HARRY
Duke aus

The dog instantly assumes a sitting position Joan out
of breath and exhilarated with fear and excitement turns
to Harry

MAN TROUBLE - Rev 42991 25

JOAN

of the highlights in the life of Andy Ellerman

HARRY

interest as he looks at a photograph of Andy and a man

on a hunting safari in Africa

Feeling slighted she watches him move to a picture of
Andy descending the steps of a plane with Layls watching

her on the tarmac

HARRY

individual Id really like to meet

He leans in close to a photograph of Andy in a bikini

saying

to hear me out

HARRY

No you hear me out friend
He takes note of the driver (STURGE) coming around the
front of the car He stops a few feet off and unbuttons
his jacket revealing the cross-strap of a shoulder
holster

Harry steps over to the window leans down and
communicates in more politic tones
HARRY
Look I happen to have a very
high regard for this party And
maybe I even have some feelings of
a personal nature here

Well I dont want to appear to be
taking unfair advantage of you

But in developing certain

our attention that your name isnt

name is Eugene Earl Axline

HARRY
Wait a minute

MONCRIEF
And that both the IRS and an
impressive number of creditors in

(looks up
at Harry)
seem to be somewhat interested
in your whereabouts
Harry stands up leaving the vulnerable area of his
stomach framed in the passenger window When he leans
back down a deeply conflicted expression is apparent on
his face
HARRY

You know thats not necessarily
entirely accurate I mean I dont
know where you come up with these
so-called facts but

(at a loss

he looks

off shaking

his head)
I cant go sneaking around
stealing this ladys property

Id like to pose that the name

decent man is not the property
of Mrs Ellerman or her sister

He takes a voucher from the folder and sets the file

aside

lawyer

HARRY
Well hes right I couldve told

out from behind the sheet of plywood holding the ax in
his hand and as he moves toward the front of the car she
screams

He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio-

an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con-

ON HARRY AND JOAN
Seated at the dining table He is deeply morose and
makes a half-hearted attempt to enthuse as she tries to
secure the clasp (The empty box and the card rest on

into the house)

his fork and begins poking with disinterest at his food

Joans eyes remain on him trying to divine his mood
JOAN
Is anything wrong

HARRY
No Nothings wrong Everythings

She resumes eating Then desirous of drawing his atten-
tion she fixes her gaze on the table top and smiles
pensively making the assumption that he is looking at
her When no response is forthcoming she attempts a
verbal solicitation
JOAN

(without looking up)
Youre probably wondering why Im
smiling

He looks over at her

difficult excursion into the truth
