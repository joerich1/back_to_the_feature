A SLOE-EYED COW

staring directly at us her head framed by a round wooden
hole WIDEN to reveal

EXT SOUTH SEAS - DAY

The cow gazes from a porthole aboard the RMS Bristol a
homely schooner in Her Majesty mail fleet A stiff wind
blows The ship rides heaving swells under a dramatic sky

SUPERED TITLE SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN 1861
INT SHIPS STEERAGE HOLD - DAY

The cow munches hay unimpressed by the sight of the passing
ocean Milk SQUIRTS in a pail OS She drops her head for
more hay

JACK ROBINSON 8 appears in the porthole looking out with
an expression of boredom that matches the cows Thirty-five
days at sea does that to a kid

JACK
Theres a storm coming

The cow raises her head chews more hay

JACK (CONTD)
Its getting rough

His tone is blase He turns His mother HEIDI ROBINSON a
beautiful strong woman with clean features and intelligent
eyes doesnt look up from milking the cow

The floor is littered with hay A donkey two pigs chickens
and ducks share the Robinson familys cramped cabin along
with mail sacks and cargo

HEIDI
Mind your chores Dont forget the
captain needs his boots polished

JACK
Mother do I have to

HEIDI
Not if you want to be set afloat ina
lifeboat

JACK

Someday Im going to sail on a real
ship with a stateroom a dining
room

His eyes light up as he pictures it Heidi pushes the pail
across the floor with a look that says And until then
INT COMPANIONWAY - DAY

Jack lugs the brimming pail down the corridor the ship
rolling under his feet

INT MESS HALL - DAY

Jack enters TWO SURLY SAILORS are playing cards at one of
the tables Jack goes to the galley nearly collides with
the COOK as he comes out with a huge iron pot

COOK
Look out boy Youll be dinner
next

The surly sailors laugh Jack dodges past him to the galley
EXT DECK - DAY

Jack comes up onto the heaving deck His brother FRITZ 17
lean hot-blooded and restless to prove himself in the world
is on hands and knees scrubbing the deck

JACK
Its almost lunch Youll want to be
in line before the meat is gone

FIRST MATE GREER a gruff but fair taskmaster overhears it

GREER
Its lunch when I say it is Keep
working Fritz Robinson

Fritz rolls his eyes Jack sees ERNST 15 using a sextant
under the tutelage of CAPTAIN JONES at the helm Ernst is
slender and bookish with an eager expression

JACK
How come Ernst isnt working

FRITZ
He convinced the captain hes put to
better use as a navigator

Their father JOHANN sloshes water from a bucket and drops
to his knees with a brush A handsome guy of middle years
Johann looks out of place scrubbing a deck

JOHANN
And why not Let every man find the
thing for which he is put on Earth
John Locke

FRITZ
And you were put on Earth to swab the
deck

Johann looks amused by his sons challenge
JOHANN
Of course not But in necessity lies
invention Maybe after this Ill
come up with a new way to swab the
deck a machine that will free
thousands from drudgery and make us
rich in the process What would you
think of that

Fritzs face shows what he thinks of it but the ships BELL
sounds before he can put it in words

INT

CUT TO

MESS HALL - DAY

The CAMERA TRACKS the faces of the 14 OR SO PASSENGERS
(including the Robinsons) who sit elbow-to-elbow at a long
table eating watery soup and thin strips of salted meat

The passengers have the look of economic refugees worn out
by life and the long voyage They eat in silence
the exception holding forth

JOHANN
-- the key is freedom The freedom
to follow ones dreams To be
oneself to think for oneself Isnt
that why were all on this ship To
be free of the naysayers the civil
servants and fat loafing
aristocrats --

HEIDI
(embarrassed)
Johann please

JOHANN
Why Youre afraid Ill offend our
fellow passengers Hochstetter are
you a fat aristocrat

Johann is

HOCHSTETTER a gaunt youth with a YOUNG WIFE blushes

HOCHSTETTER
I should say not sir

JOHANN
And whats your plan when we get to
New Guinea

HOCHSTETTER
To buy a farm sir We got evicted
from ours by the county squire They
say theres land for everyone where
were going
JOHANN
And good luck to you sir In the
New World a mans future is as big
as his dreams

QUILTY a hard-bitten Bantam rooster of a man eyes Johann
skeptically

QUILTY
And what will you do with all this
freedom Mr Robinson Whats your
plan

Johann takes a beat before deciding to share it

JOHANN
Wheels Rubber wheels

Hochstetters wife lets out a braying laugh then clamps a
hand to her mouth in embarrassment

JOHANN (CONTD)
Its all right dear As I always
say if an idea doesnt get a laugh
or two a mans not thinking big
enough The fact is New Guinea is
full of rubber trees

QUILTY
(derisively)
And why in Gods name would anyone
want wheels made from rubber

JOHANN
Rubber wheels are the future
Wagons bicycles carriages --
someday theyll all run on rubber
wheels inflated with air

The passengers hoot with laughter Instead of being
offended Johann raises his cup

JOHANN (CONTD)
Mark my words A year from now we
wont be choking down old beef and
thin soup Well be rejoicing in our
success To following ones dreams

PASSENGERS
Hear hear

They drink Ernst and Jack drink and gaze at Johann proudly
impressed as always by his charisma Fritz doesnt drink and
looks like hes heard this spiel or one like it before

HOCHSTETTERS WIFE
You have such conviction Mr
Robinson Its a fine trait
JOHANN
Thank you Berta But Im no
different than any of you I simply
want whats best for my family

Johann looks over at Heidi who smiles supportively From
above comes a cry

LOOKOUT (0S)
SAIL HO

The passengers trade looks of surprise
CUT TO
EXT DECK - DAY

Johann and his family come up on deck along with a number of
other passengers They go to the railing

THEIR POV - A RIGGED STEAMSHIP

with all sails drawn aiming straight for the Bristol (A
rigged steamship is a ship with sails and a coal-fired
engine the smokestack placed between the masts)

BACK TO SCENE

Johann looks uneasy Notwithstanding the ship s Union Jack
theres something sinister about its dingy sails and belching
smokestack Heidi comes to his side

HEIDI
Its Royal Navy

At the Bristols stern Captain Jones is peering through a
spyglass at the ship speaking urgently with officers EZRA
a grizzled sea dog stands near Johann His face is drawn

EZRA
Aye shes Navy And a bad number
too

JOHANN

Why do you say that
EZRA
Look at her Been through a fire
Sails like brothel sheets
He shakes his head ominously Johann looks rattled
THEIR POV - THE SHIP
As it gets closer they can see that the stern (near the

captains quarters) is blackened by fire The ship is
raising a red and black pennant
BACK TO SCENE
Ezra breathes in sharply

EZRA
Blimey

JOHANN
What is it

Before Ezra can answer there is a BOOM and a cannonball
SCREECHES over the water passing before their bow

JOHANN (CONTD)
Get down

The Robinsons drop to the deck Johann shields Heidi and
Jack BOOM Another cannonball hits the water sends water
SPLASHING over them

JOHANN (CONTD)
Heidi get the children below

Heidi dashes below with Jack and Ernst Sailors are running
helter-skelter Captain Jones barking orders Greer passes
out muskets from a meager arsenal Fritz goes over

FRITZ
Ill take one

JOHANN
Fritz no Get below

Fritz looks at his father in disbelief

FRITZ
Father --

JOHANN
Now

Fritz sees Johanns face knows its useless to argue He
runs to catch up with his mother and brothers Johann takes
a pistol from Greer

INT STEERAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Heidi Fritz Ernst and Jack plow through the door Jack
runs to the porthole Fritz digs in a leather tool bag

JACK
Theyre coming alongside

HEIDI
Jack get away from there

Fritz takes a hammer from the bag hands it to Ernst and
takes a hatchet for himself GUNSHOTS ring out on deck
HEIDI (CONTD)
Oh my God

FRITZ

Quick everyone hide Mother you

and Jack in here Ernst over here
They all hide as the attacking vessel creeps alongside
EXT DECK - DAY
The battle it turns out was brief
Ezra and two sailors lie dead Captain Jones has a bullet
wound to his arm He stands stoically in a line with Johann
and the surviving crew weapons at their feet
Emblazoned on the bow of the attacking ship HMS ACTAEON
ON THE ACTAEON
BRITISH SAILORS aim rifles down at the mail ship There is
something unkempt and undisciplined in their manner Several

wear uniforms with fire and smoke damage

A dozen armed sailors swing on ropes over to the Bristol

CAPTAIN HORACE BRAGG lands on the deck A dark commanding
figure with flowing hair and malignant eyes he goes over to
Captain Jones

BRAGG
Captain Horace Bragg Her Majestys
Navy Which one of these men is your
navigator

CAPTAIN JONES
Youre the captain sure as Im the
Earl of Sandwich Lets see your
papers

Bragg eyes him with menace Captain Jones stands his ground

BRAGG
Say again

CAPTAIN JONES
Youre a mutineer and so are these
men Wheres your real captain Did
you kill him

BRAGG
Captain Teawell is dead Of an
accident As first officer I took
over I am the captain

He says it mildly but with eerie intensity his eyes never
leaving Captain Jones
BRAGG (CONTD)
And I believe I asked as to your
navigator

Captain Jones glares Bragg aims a pistol at his head
turning to the Bristols crew

BRAGG (CONTD)
Will the navigator please identify
himself or do I have to splatter your
captains brains on the deck

A bespectacled officer HENRY POINTER raises his hand
meekly

BRAGG (CONTD)
Your name

POINTER
(scared)
Helm Officer Pointer sir

BRAGG
Wheres this sorry tub headed

POINTER
The colonies in New Guinea Were a
mail ship

BRAGG
And you Youve kicked around these
parts how long

POINTER
I beg your pardon

BRAGG
I mean you know the place The
shipping lanes The islands The
reefs and shoals How long have you
sailed the South Seas

POINTER
Going on 11 years sir

Bragg nods to MAGGOT and KILROY two burly sailors

BRAGG
Hell do

Maggot and Kilroy take Pointer by the arms Pointer
protests but they march him across a gangplank to the
Actaeon

CAPTAIN JONES
I demand to know the meaning of -
Bragg FIRES Jones falls dead Johann and the mail ship
crew gasp with shock Bragg turns to his men led by
DONEGAL a coarse-featured powerfully built first mate

BRAGG
Mr Donegal go below bring me every
Map on the ship The rest of you
scare up anything worth your while

The raiders head below Braggs gaze shifts to Johann drops
to his leather boots

BRAGG (CONTD)
Misplaced your goat herd have you
How many passengers like yourself on
board How many women

His eyes glint Johann swallows

JOHANN
Im the only passenger Unless you
like reading peoples letters
theres nothing of value for you
here

Bragg eyes him darkly A bead of sweat rolls down Johanns
cheek

INT COMPANIONWAY - DAY

The raiders swarm belowdecks ransacking cabins and tossing
booty into the hall Hochstetters wife is pulled screaming
from her cabin

INT STEERAGE - DAY

The door bursts open and two raiders sweep in TREVELYAN is
small wiry and dissolute HOGG is a Frankenstein-like
giant seven feet tall and built like a privy

FRITZ AND ERNST

watch from their hiding places Fritz is behind a crate
Ernst crouched in a barrel peering out through the cork hole
as Trevelyan goes to a desk covered with his books and
papers

Trevelyan unrolls a painstakingly drawn architectural
blueprint

TREVELYAN
What is this rot

He looks at it with a scowl then sweeps the papers to the
floor Fritz shoots a look at Ernst shaking his head
silently urging him to stay calm Ernst fumes

A flutter of movement makes Fritz turn and look through a
porthole at the Actaeon across the water

FRITZS POV - A CABIN BOY
signaling from a porthole on the Actaeon Later well call

him ADAM Hes in his mid-teens a grubby urchin with
delicate features He mouths a frantic but inaudible plea

BACK TO SCENE

Fritz tries to make out what the boy is saying but a SQUEAL
seizes his attention away

Hogg is reeling about the cabin with a pig under one arm
trying to capture the other pig He smashes against the
wardrobe

IN THE WARDROBE

Concealed by hanging clothes Heidi clutches Jack and covers
his mouth as the wardrobe is buffeted Jack wields a
jackknife

Peering through the clothes Jack can see Hogg struggle with
the pigs and send a chicken airborne with a kick

The pigs squirm and flail Hogg loses his balance and falls
backwards into the wardrobe Jack thrusts with the knife

HOGG
Aaaagghh

Hogg drops the pigs He whirls and sweeps aside the clothes
to expose Heidi and Jack

At the same instant Trevelyan brings up his pistol as Fritz
and Ernst leap from their hiding places They freeze

TREVELYAN
Ha -- a coupla runts layin for us
Go on boys I dare you

The boys drop their weapons Hogg looks down at the
jackknife planted in his ass He glowers at Jack

HOGG
Youre dead boy

EXT DECK - MINUTES LATER

THUNDER rolls Its raining the seas rougher Raiders
bring passengers up on deck and carry plunder across to the
Actaeon

Chickens ducks and pigs erupt from the companionway in a
NOISY SENSATION Heidi and her sons follow brought up at
gunpoint by the renegade sailors

Johann watches with growing panic as the Actaeon crew HOOT
and SHOUT CATCALLS at the female passengers Jack looks at
his father with pleading eyes

JACK
Father Do something

Johann stands there helpless Ten feet away a raider is
bent over taking boots off a dead sailor He has a pistol
in his belt

Johann takes a step closer summoning his nerve Donegal
crosses to Bragg

DONEGAL
I sent the maps over Weve rum
dinner and good sport for the crew

BRAGG
Very well Show the women on board
the rest into the drink --

Johann lunges grabs the boot-stealers pistol and shoves him
to the deck He fumbles back the hammer aims at Bragg

JOHANN
Dont move

His hands tremble Bragg regards him coolly

BRAGG
So you captured Mr Vaughns pistol
Remind me to reproach Mr Vaughn for
his carelessness

JOHANN
Get off this ship

BRAGG
Are you aware Mr Vaughn was taking
boots from a man he killed with that
pistol And hes had no time to
reload

JOHANN
Youre bluffing

BRAGG
Then see for yourself Pull the
trigger Youre hesitating Why

Bragg smiles like a man who knows hes holding all the cards

BRAGG (CONTD)
Is it because if you do pull the
trigger youll know that Im not the
one whos bluffing

There is a GUTTURAL SOUND and Bragg turns

Quilty the passenger who challenged Johann in the mess hall
is aiming a fierce little derringer at close range

QUILTY
Get your hands in the air you sack
of shit His gun may be empty but
this one will blow your head to Siam
Tell your men to drop their weapons

Bragg takes his measure doesnt like what he sees and
indicates for his men to surrender their weapons Quilty
hands Braggs pistol to Johann

QUILTY (CONTD)
If he twitches shoot him Mr
Greer how shall we dispose of these
scum

GREER
Cast off lines men Hoist the
mainsail They can swim to their
ship

swim QUILTY
wim

GREER
Thats right Mr Quilty They may
be cold-blooded killers but my men
are still bound by the laws of the
sea Well report them soon enough

Quilty nods grudgingly The mail ship crew cast off lines
and the ships start drifting apart Lightning CRASHES rain
falls harder Bragg gives Johann a sulfurous look

BRAGG
Count your blessings goatherd Next
time there wont be anyone to clean
up your mistakes

Johann trains the pistol on him Rain beats on their faces
The mainsail gives a WOOF as it fills with wind Greer waits
until the ships are far apart then addresses the raiders

GREER
Over the side with you and may God
save your souls

The raiders leap into the sea and begin swimming for the
Actaeon Bragg looks at Johann with loathing Johann
gestures with the pistol

JOHANN
You heard him Dont test his
compassion

Sneering Bragg goes to the railing and steps off -- SPLASH
Johann lowers the pistol legs turning to rubber Heidi runs
to him and they embrace Jack runs to the railing

JACK
I hope you drown I hope a shark
bites your butt off

Johann laughs weakly Jack turns excited

JACK (CONTD)
We did it father We showed those
buccaneers

Theres a flash of lightning and a HUGE THUNDERCLAP Greer
comes over has to shout over the rising storm

GREER

Get your family below sir Were

sailing into weather
The Robinsons trade looks of concern

CUT TO

EXT BRISTOL - DAY - TWENTY MINUTES LATER
Lightning CRASHES The sky is black with thunderclouds
Rain and wind lash the ship Johann climbs the furiously
tilting deck Huge waves wash over the railing
The Actaeon is nowhere in sight The storms the danger now
The shorthanded crew works desperately to keep the Bristol
from foundering Johann helps a sailor secure a luffing

sail

He cleats a line but a sudden gust whips it free and the
boom swings in a lethal arc The sailor ducks just in time

Greer runs over staying low under the whipping boom

GREER
Mr Robinson I told you to stay
below

JOHANN

You dont have enough men

GREER
I need sailors not Swiss burghers
Get below man

Johann sees hes more hindrance than help moves aft

INT STEERAGE - DAY

Heidi and Fritz fight to close a porthole while Ernst and
Jack try to calm the animals The cabin is ankle-deep in
water Loose objects cascade on the seesawing flood

Johann staggers through the door A barrel sloshes downhill
against the bulkhead A cage flies open and ejects flapping
chickens

The donkey loses its footing yanks its tether from the wall
and goes sliding across the pitched cabin floor hooves
windmilling eyes filled with terror

At the same time theres a HUGE CRASH the sound of
structural failure somewhere in the ship Heidi screams
reaches out to her husband

HEIDI
Johann

He struggles toward her but the ship lurches suddenly and
SMASHES him against the bulkhead

EXT BRISTOL - NIGHT
The storm rages A 40-foot wall of water CRASHES over the
bow sweeping two sailors overboard while a third hangs on
desperately to a rope
INT STEERAGE - NIGHT
Jack sobs and buries his head in Heidis chest Fritz and

Ernst cling to a beam Johann can only watch in horror
powerless against natures wrath

EXT OCEAN - NIGHT

As the Bristol is tossed like a cork in the giant waves we
PULL BACK higher and higher until

AERIAL SHOT
The storm reaches a furious crescendo A BOLT OF LIGHTNING
illuminates the Bristol just a tiny speck in the angry

ocean

CUT TO BLACK

Blackness Silence Then a TINY CREAK

FADE IN

INT BELOWDECKS - DAY

Stillness The interior is dark More timbers CREAK

Sunlight enters through cracks in the planking We hear
SLOSHING GRUNTS then a RASP of shifting wood

EXT DECK - DAY

Johann slides away a hatch cover and climbs up into the
dazzling sunlight The ship is tilted over 30 degrees
Heidi and the boys follow squinting against the light

JOHANN
Hello Mr Greer
(pause)
Anyone

There is only eerie silence

The Robinsons look around in amazement The Bristol has run
aground on a jagged rock washed by the waves The crew is
gone Sails and rigging lie strewn across the deck

JACK
Where is everyone

One by one they turn until they are all facing
REVERSE ANGLE
the island

Its a lush wilderness ringed with sand -- paradise to a
modern tourist terrifying to a castaway A peak covered
with tropical foliage looms over the beach

ERNST
Maybe they set ashore

FRITZ
Like hell they did Look at this

He stands at the railing looking down at a gash in the hull
that runs nearly the length of the ship and stops just shy of
the Robinsons cabin

HEIDI
My God do you suppose were the only
ones alive

As they consider it the boat SHUDDERS and slides a few feet
off the rock tilting the deck even further Livestock BRAY
and SQUAWK belowdecks

JOHANN
We need to get ashore Go below get
everything you can -- food clothes --
HEIDI
Medicine
JACK

What about the animals We cant
leave the animals

JOHANN
All right the animals But hurry
Ill build a raft Go

They run belowdecks Johann grabs a hatch cover throws it
on the deck and searches for other pieces for a raft

INT STEERAGE - DAY
Jack hurriedly untethers and herds animals toward the door
INT CAPTAINS QUARTERS - DAY
Ernst throws papers and logbooks in an oilskin bag He grabs
a spyglass tugs out a drawer and finds pens protractors and
a magnifying glass It all goes in the bag
INT GALLEY - DAY
Heidi hauls foodstuffs from a locker and tosses them in a
sailors hammock She takes down the hammock knots the ends
together She grabs utensils from a drawer
INT COMPANIONWAY - DAY
Jack sends ducks chickens and pigs splashing ahead of him
down the corridor Fritz joins him and they use all their
strength to pull the donkey and cow up a ramp to the deck
EXT DECK - DAY
Johann heaves loosely joined planks and hatch covers in the
water jumps in and treads water as he lashes them together
to make a crude raft

CUT TO
EXT SEA - DAY

The overladen raft wallows as the Robinsons pilot it through
calm water to shore

Johann and Fritz keep weight off the raft by swimming
alongside and keeping it on course Heidi Jack and Ernst
kneel on the raft and stroke with makeshift paddles

Chickens perch on barrels lashed alongside The ducks paddle
happily The cow donkey and pigs bring up the rear of the
flotilla

Before them the dense green curtain of jungle looms

EXT BEACH - DAY

Johann and Fritz walk the raft in to shore through light

surf Ernst Heidi and Jack jump off and they all drag the
raft onto the sand The animals struggle ashore

Heidi and the boys drop to the sand panting Johann surveys
the beach Its pristine untouched by footprints

Johann looks out to sea The horizon is empty He looks up
at the peak Fritz stands follows his gaze the same
thought forming Off their faces --

CUT TO
A SCRAPED-UP HAND
reaches INTO FRAME and grips sharp volcanic rock
EXT PEAK - WIDER - DAY

Johann works his way up the hillside Ernst and Fritz are
behind him gasping as they climb the final grueling pitch

ERNST
If we can see over the ridge maybe
theres a village or were ona
peninsula part of a larger land
mass
Fritz loses his footing grabs a thorny plant

FRITZ
Aagh

They clamber onto the summit panting They turn slowly
taking in the 360-degree vista

THEIR POV

Ocean stretches to the horizon The island is small five
square miles or less Its in the middle of nowhere

BACK TO SCENE

They just stand there Its a grim sight No ships or signs
of human life They look at one another speechless

There is a CRY and they look down to see the tiny figures of
Heidi and Jack waving hopefully from the beach surrounded by
their ragged menagerie
Johann waves back weakly

CUT TO
INT BRIG - ACTAEON - DAY
Pointer the mail ship navigator sits in the grimy cell
jiggling one knee Keys JANGLE and he springs to his feet

backing against the wall Kilroy opens the cell flanked by
Maggot

KILROY
Capn wants you

Pointer swallows Kilroy gestures impatiently After a
beat Pointer steps warily into the hall

INT CAPTAINS QUARTERS - DAY

Maggot and Kilroy show Pointer in Bragg Donegal and a
third man CRUMLEY a snappish haughty officer are eating
around a table They barely look up at Pointer

KILROY
That be all Capn

Bragg nods eating Maggot and Kilroy leave Pointer just
stands there the men ignoring him as they eat

Pointer looks around amazed The cabin once handsomely
appointed has been damaged by fire Soot covers the stern
windows Burned maps and books are heaped in a corner

Adam the cabin boy enters with a serving dish Bragg
shakes his head pushes his plate away

BRAGG
Rum boy

Adam takes his plate Bragg wipes his mouth with a napkin
looks up at Pointer

BRAGG (CONTD)
I need you to find an island

Pointer blinks Adam takes Donegals plate goes to Crumley

BRAGG (CONTD)
Its small part of the Banda Chain
Theres two or three hundred islands
there --

CRUMLEY
DAMMIT BOY LOOK WHAT YOUVE DONE

He shoves back from the table raising his fist Adam
cowers Crumley indicates a drop of gravy on his sleeve
Adam hangs his head

ADAM
Begging your pardon sir It was an
accident

Crumley BELTS him Adam falls Choking back cries he
crawls across the floor to retrieve the dishes and runs out
Bragg goes on like nothing happened

BRAGG
The Bandas You know them

POINTER
(scared)
Yes

BRAGG
If you cooperate and youre
successful Ill let you go I might
even reward you If not

He leaves it unsaid Donegal chuckles Pointer trembles

POINTER
Which island is it
CRUMLEY
(snorting)

If we knew that we wouldnt need
you would we

Pointer swallows Adam returns his face red where he was
struck He sets a bottle of rum on the table and leaves

BRAGG
The island is uncharted Captain
Teawell was able to determine its
rough location But when I made
clear I intended to take over the
ship he barricaded himself in here
and set fire to his work rather than
share it

DONEGAL
And fricasseed himself while he was
at it You can still smell the
burned flesh

Pointer looks sickened Bragg reaches for a soot-covered
bottle on a shelf Something RATTLES inside He uncorks the
bottle and shakes out a cylinder of parchment He hands it
to Pointer

BRAGG
Take a look

Pointer hesitates then unrolls the parchment part of which
is burned away

ANGLE TO INCLUDE PARCHMENT

It features drawings of an island in different views as well
as diagrams showing the island in relation to different
celestial bodies Pointers head spins

BRAGG
He would have burned that too but I
got to it in time

POINTER
I I dont understand This is
what you have to go on You want me
to find an island with this

Crumley scowls
CRUMLEY

I told you he wasnt up to the job
To the sharks I say

POINTER
(quickly)
No -- I didnt mean that I can find
it I just
BRAGG
Yes
POINTER

These celestial observations
theyre all right but theyre
inexact done with the naked eye

BRAGG
Without instruments

POINTER
So even if we could narrow it down
wed be talking about a huge search
area We might have to visit
hundreds of islands

The officers trade glances Bragg seems pleased by Pointers
quick grasp of the challenge He looks at Donegal

BRAGG
Show him back to his quarters Give
him maps and anything else he needs
I want a guard on him day and night

DONEGAL
Aye sir

He rises and leaves with Pointer When they are alone
Crumley looks at Bragg with misgivings

CRUMLEY
You heard him Its a process of
elimination It could take months or
years to find Melvilles island

Bragg appears unfazed He takes the bottle and again we hear
a RATTLE inside He tilts it back and forth

CLOSE ON BOTTLE

revealing a WHOPPER OF A PEARL rolling back and forth inside

BRAGG
And worth every minute

CUT TO
EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Crates are stacked on the sand The farm animals stay close
as the Robinsons bow their heads and join hands around a
makeshift dinner table

JOHANN
Bless us Lord and these gifts which
we are about to receive from your
bounty Protect us in our hour of
need as we pledge to be strong and
of good courage We shall fear not
nor fail you nor forsake you Amen

They survey the unappetizing meal of soggy hardtack and
pemmican try a few tentative bites Ernst shivers

ERNST
Im cold How could it be cold in
the tropics

HEIDI
Youre wet

ERNST
No Im not

JOHANN
Youre sunburned

Ernst shivers again They eat some more in silence Fritz
grunts and stops chewing Heidi looks at him

HEIDI
Sand

Fritz reaches into his mouth removes a tiny crab and holds
it up by a claw Jacks face lights up

JACK
Its a fiddler crab Is it alive

Fritz eyes the crab and shakes his head tossing it away
Jack looks sad continues eating Johann expels a breath

JOHANN
Look its not all lost We have the
sextant With a little guesswork we
can get a rough fix on our position
I dont expect well be here too
long

FRITZ
(doubtful)
We wont

JOHANN
Sure Tomorrow well light a signal
fire Before long well see a ship

Fritz grunts skeptical Johann gives him a look

JOHANN (CONTD)
Yes Fritz

FRITZ
Nothing Forget it
JOHANN
You have something to say
A beat -- as Fritz weighs challenging his father then
FRITZ

There wont be any ships
Johann gives him a stern look

JOHANN
And whys that

FRITZ
You know why They steer away from
islands because of uncharted hazards
The captain said so himself dont
you remember

Heidi looks at Johann concerned

HEIDI
Johann Is that true

Johann works his jaw He doesnt like being contradicted
He clears his throat

JOHANN
Well theres always the exception
And in the meantime were not in
immediate danger We have food
clothing supplies

ERNST
Theres more on the ship father

JOHANN
Exactly Good thinking Ernst We
can fish We have a pistol so we can
hunt --

JACK
(excited)
You think there are animals here

JOHANN
Sure What kind of island doesnt
have animals

JACK
I want to see a lion Or a tiger
Maybe theres an elephant

HEIDI
Just dont go exploring alone

Johann smiles Heidi looks at him unsettled
JOHANN

The important thing is we keep our

heads We survived the worst of it

We may find things arent so bad
He looks at his family finding varying degrees of accord in
their faces Fritz wont meet his eye the tension
unresolved between them

CUT TO

EXT ISLAND - NIGHT
Lightning flickers in the distance
INT LEAN-TO - NIGHT
The CAMERA DOES A SLOW WANDER over the Robinsons as they lie

awake on the sand under a crude lean-to of palm fronds Wind
RUSTLES the leaves THUNDER rolls in the distance

HEIDI
(scared)
Johann
JOHANN

Its all right Just a squall

Theres a blinding flash BOOM Rain PELTS the structure
and drips through the fronds Jack whimpers

JACK
Mother

HEIDI
Yes Jack

JACK

Are we going to die

JOHANN
No

More LIGHTNING Rain falls in sheets Gusts tear at the
structure and send pieces of it flying away They have to
shout over the storm

HEIDI
We cant stay here

A huge wave CRASHES and floods the structure with foaming
surf The animals are fleeing to higher ground The
Robinsons jump up and follow Fritz turns pointing

FRITZ
The supplies

Johann looks over The surf is carrying away the wooden
crates they salvaged from the ship He shouts to Heidi

JOHANN
Take Jack Get under the trees
Fritz Ernst -- come on

Johann Fritz and Ernst run over to corral the boxes and move
them to higher ground Fritz gets his arms around a crate
but a surge of whitewater carries it away

He clings to the box The wave runs out taking him and the
box with it Another wave SMASHES down Johann runs into
the churning water grabs Fritz by the arm

JOHANN (CONTD)
Leave it

FRITZ
Its all we have

JOHANN
Leave it

A wave knocks them flat the box smashing into Fritz Johann
pulls him to his feet They stagger from the surf with
Ernst

EXT EDGE OF JUNGLE - NIGHT
Johann Fritz and Ernst join Heidi and Jack under a gigantic
tree Heidi moves to Fritz Blood has begun to flow from a

gash on his arm

HEIDI
Fritz are you all right

She tries to examine the gash but he shakes his head They
turn to look out at the storm

Rain falls in sheets hurricane-strength gusts whipping the
sea to a frenzy the crates tossed about on the waves

The Robinsons stand there soaking and dazed The livestock
huddle around them Rain drips through the leaves Johann
looks over at Heidi

JOHANN
Heidi

She looks away shoulders shaking Johanns eyes fill with
sadness as he watches his wife sob quietly to herself

SLOW FADE OUT
FADE IN
EXT EDGE OF JUNGLE - MORNING

With his face pressed to the ground Ernst stirs and opens
one eye A foot away a hen pecks for grubs amid the roots

Ernst sits up looks around His clothes are muddy Fritz
and Heidi sleep nearby Jack is curled against the cows
belly Ernst looks toward the beach

ANOTHER ANGLE

Johann is dragging wood from the shipwreck up the sand
tossing it in a pile The sky is a cloudless blue the bay
calm Johann doesnt notice Ernst watching him

ERNST
You building a fire

Johann looks up shakes his head

ERNST (CONTD)
So whats it for

JOHANN
A shelter

He picks up a cube made from bamboo lashed together with
vines He tosses it to Ernst continues stacking wood

JOHANN (CONTD)
Try to break it

Ernst shakes the cube tentatively It keeps its shape He
bangs it on a root The others are stirring

JOHANN (CONTD)
Strong huh

ERNST
Yeah it is Its really strong
You think we could build with it

JOHANN
Between bamboo and wood from the
ship I figure we can put a roof over
our heads We cant have another
night like the last right

Heidi sits up rubs her back Jack looks up into the tree

JACK
Hey

They follow his gaze and see a monkey sitting on a branch

JOHANN
Hes been watching you for hours
Jack I think he likes you

Jack looks at the monkey marveling The monkey suddenly
takes off through the trees Jack jumps up runs after him

JACK
Hey come back here

HEIDI
Jack

Johann gestures for her to let him go

JOHANN
(calling out)
Dont go too far Jack

JACK
I wont

He disappears into the trees Johann comes over sits on a
rock and takes Heidis hand

JOHANN
Look Ive been thinking This is a
chance to use our wits to use our
ingenuity Until were rescued why
not make the best of it Learn from
it The first thing we should do is
inventory our possessions take stock
of what we have --

Fritz rises starts walking away Johann looks over

JOHANN (CONTD)
Fritz
(a beat)
Fritz

He keeps walking Johann starts after him but Heidi
gestures
HEIDI
Let me talk to him

She heads after Fritz Ernst looks at Johann awkward
CAMERA FOLLOWS HEIDI
as she hurries down the beach after Fritz

HEIDI
Fritz

He keeps going Heidi quickens her pace

FRITZ
I cant help it mother Im sick of
this

HEIDI

Fritz stop
He does

FRITZ
I wanted to join the army I put in
my papers I bet he doesnt even
know that In another year I could
have been serving with the Guards

HEIDI
Were a family Your father is doing
his best for us

FRITZ
Were a family Were a family
only when it suits him to talk to
about it

He sees Ernst coming over

FRITZ (CONTD)
Ernst was going to study architecture
at university Heres your
classroom Ernst Look at all the
architecture

He gestures sweepingly

ERNST
Come on Fritz Dont make it worse

FRITZ
And how about you mother Youre
telling me you wanted to emigrate to
New Guinea

HEIDI
Absolutely I did Your father needed
a fresh start --

FRITZ
Sure he did Just like after all his
other grand ideas collapsed Im
tired of him going on about freedom
and destiny like his freedom and
destiny is all that matters

Heidi compresses her lips Fritz has struck a nerve
FRITZ (CONTD)
Face it mother Were starting over
in the New World because father
failed in the Old One And were all
paying for it
Their eyes meet Jack suddenly bursts from the trees
JACK
Mother Father Come quick I found
something
They all stare
CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER

The Robinsons stand at the edge of a clearing staring up in
amazement

THEIR POV - AN OLD TREEHOUSE

nestled in the branches of a huge banyan tree Its a crude
structure in serious disrepair covered with vines and
cobwebs Little sunlight reaches it through the dense
canopy (Anyone familiar with the treehouse in the 1960
movie would find this one decrepit and homely by comparison )
BACK TO SCENE

The Robinsons stand in silence Its an eerie sight reeking
of mystery and foreboding They speak in whispers

HEIDI
You think someone lives there

Johann is silent nervously thumbing the pistol stock

ERNST
What do you think Father

JOHANN
I dont know
(calling out)
Hello

Beat Silence

JOHANN (CONTD)
Anyone there

Theres a MUFFLED SOUND like a weight shifting in the
structure Johann tenses Heidi glances at him quickly

HEIDI
(soft)
What is it

Johann shakes his head no clue He looks at the trees

JOHANN
Maybe just the wind

He doesnt sound too sure of it Theres barely any breeze
Gripping the pistol he moves toward the tree Fritz
follows

Johann stops looks at him Fritz meets his gaze A beat
then Johann nods and they go to the bamboo steps leading up

JOHANN (CONTD)
(calling up)
Hello

A CREAK again Johann and Fritz trade a look A big hairy
spider on its web blocks the way up Johann gingerly sweeps
away the web with the pistol tests the steps and begins
climbing

INT TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Johann reaches the top step A crude door sags on its
leather hinges ajar He pushes on it steps inside Fritz
follows

With a SQUEAL a huge hairless rodent shoots across the
floor sends Johann stumbling into Fritz and plows past them
through the door

Johann clutches his chest He manages a weak smile exhales
They look around in amazement

The place is a shambles but built with obvious skill
Insects and rodent droppings are everywhere Vines grow up
through the floor

Heidis voice reaches them from the jungle floor

HEIDI (0S)
What do you see

JOHANN
(calling back)
Nothing yet Stay there
(soft)
Fritz

He indicates the back of the door where a big letter M is
carved in the wood along with a disconcertingly huge number
of little notches to mark the passage of time

Fritz and Johann trade an uneasy look

HEIDI (0S)
Do you see signs of anyone

Johann doesnt answer Fritz goes to a small straw cot
There are handmade utensils a coconut shell bowl and a
decomposing ruffled shirt on the floor

A table lies on its side Johann goes over takes a tobacco
pipe and moldering leather-bound book from the floor He
opens the book a King James Bible

FRITZ
Father look

Fritz is crossing to a pocket watch hanging on the wall He
reaches for it -- CRASH His foot goes through the floor

Johann shoots out a hand grabs Fritz by the arm Fritz
draws his leg from the hole Their hearts are pounding

HEIDI (0S)
My God

Fritz and Johann whirl Heidi is in the doorway looking
around in amazement Jack and Ernst climbing the steps behind
her

CUT TO
EXT TREEHOUSE - MINUTES LATER
Johann and Heidi examine artifacts from the treehouse while
the boys comb the bushes nearby Heidi feels the collar of
the ruffled shirt
HEIDI

Whoever this belongs to has expensive

tastes This is Savile Row What do

you think

Johann doesnt answer studying the pocket watch

CLOSE ON WATCH

The silver is tarnished the hands stopped but its intact
On the face LA BREGUET GENEVA He winds the watch holds
it to his ear and smiles with patriotic pride

HEIDI
Johann

JOHANN
I dont know From the looks of it
Id say just one person lived here
The question is wheres he now

ERNST
Well I think he got off the island

JOHANN
Maybe

HEIDI
You dont

JOHANN
I dont know He left his watch and
Bible Why would he do that

ERNST
Maybe he had no choice Maybe he
went out fishing in a canoe Then he
saw a ship and was rescued

Johann considers it

ERNST (CONTD)
Theres a fire ring here Anda
garbage dump where he threw his
bones and shells He must have been
here forever

Fritz is across the clearing

FRITZ
At least we know how he got through
the long hard winters

Johann and Heidi trade a look They go over find Fritz
standing over a primitive moonshine apparatus made out of
gourds and bamboo tubes Jack and Ernst join them there

HEIDI
What on earth is it

JOHANN
Its a still For making rum And
who can blame him

Heidi nods They return to the clearing and look up at the
treehouse Ernst turns to his father

ERNST
So what do you think happened

JOHANN
I dont know He could have gotten
off gotten rescued He could be
dead He could still be on the
island

They look up at the treehouse eyeing it appraisingly

HEIDI
Wherever he is it doesnt look like
hes coming back

The Robinsons trade glances as we --
CUT TO
EXT TREEHOUSE - THREE WEEKS LATER - DAY
Johann with a beard DRIVES nails in the broiling sun

He works high in the tree Sweat pours off his bare torso
He plucks a nail from his teeth and POUNDS it into a salvaged
ship timber to form the floor of a new treehouse room

The treehouse is growing The old shelter has been renovated
and spruced up the vines cut away New structures at
various stages of construction fan out on multiple levels

Heidi grunts with effort as she builds a walkway on a sloping
branch She wears a long-sleeved dress and keeps pushing up
the frilly sleeves only to have them slide down

ON THE GROUND

Jack uses a hammer to pry nails from salvaged ship timbers
then bangs them straight on a flat rock The monkey seen
earlier dubbed KNIPS now frolics nearby

JACK
I think his name was Old Black Mike
He was a pirate

HEIDI
A good pirate or a bad pirate

JACK
A good pirate With one arm The
other got chopped clean off by a
cannonball

He takes aim at a mangled nail -- BANG The nail flies away
KNIPS runs after it

JACK (CONTD)
Give it back Knips

Knips hands the nail to Jack

HEIDI
So howd he get shipwrecked

JACK
Maybe he didnt Maybe the other
pirates put him ashore after a fight
over a pirate queen Or maybe he was
battling a sea monster and it ate
his ship and his crew and hes the
only one who survived

Heidi smiles amused by her sons vivid imagination
EXT BRISTOL - DAY

The wreck lies heeled over on its side In the bow Fritz
and Ernst salvage wood and rigging with an ax and heave the
pieces onto a raft floating alongside Its strenuous work
Their shirtless bodies glisten in the tropical sun

ERNST
Fritz what if you found out youd
never get off this island What
would you miss most

FRITZ
I dont know Girls

ERNST
Besides girls

FRITZ
More girls

Ernst rolls his eyes Fritz shrugs relenting

FRITZ (CONTD)
Lots of things Snow skiing
chocolate

ERNST
Music

FRITZ
Sure And friends too I mean no
offense or anything

ERNST
I miss books Books and libraries
What I wouldnt give for just one day
in the stacks

Just thinking about it gives Ernst a dreamy expression
Fritz looks at him like hes nuts

FRITZ
Quit daydreaming Plato The old
mans waiting on us

Ernst nods resumes working His mind turning

ERNST
What do you think he misses
FRITZ
You mean father
ERNST
Yeah
FRITZ

I dont think he misses anything He
sure doesnt miss the creditors that
took our house

He says it bitterly They continue working He casts a look
toward the bow

FRITZ (CONTD)
Ill take those stacks

He goes over crawls out onto the figurehead Its a lonely
sailors fantasy a life-sized carving of a beautiful bare-
breasted Sea Queen He grins cups her breasts

ERNST
(rolling his eyes)
Cmon Fritz

FRITZ
What Im serious Lets take her

ERNST
Were supposed to be doing a job
Father said to salvage only what we
absolutely need

FRITZ
Well I absolutely need her Give me
the ax

Ernst shakes his head passes the tool to Fritz

EXT TREEHOUSE - DAY

Work continues on the treehouse Ernst and Fritz walk ahead
of the donkey as it drags a sled stacked high with lumber the

Sea Queen perched atop From her perch in the tree Heidi
registers it with amusement trading a look with Johann

JOHANN
Thats a good haul boys Youll
have time for one more before dark

Ernst and Fritz exchange weary glances
FRITZ
Father we were looking forward to
a swim Weve been hard at it all
day

Johann uses his last nail

JOHANN
Jack Im out Send me up some more
(to Fritz)

Weve a treehouse to finish You
dont see anyone else taking a break

Heidi is sawing at a limb high in the tree She looks at
Johann considers saying something but doesnt Instead
she continues working Her sleeve slips down again and she
pushes it up with a rasp of annoyance

ON THE GROUND

Jack takes a bunch of nails puts them in a pouch and hands
it to Knips

JACK
Go Knips

Fritz sighs starts stacking lumber at the base of the tree
FRITZ
Yes sir Well go back as soon as
we finishing unloading

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS KNIPS

as he climbs the tree swings branch to branch over to where
Johann is working and hands the pouch to Johann

JOHANN
Thanks pal

He resumes working There is a RIPPING SOUND He turns

Heidi is tearing the sleeves off her dress She tosses them
away and tests her new freedom of movement with satisfaction

She sees Johanns eyes on her shrugs and continues sawing
the branch With a CRACK the branch suddenly breaks away
opening a gash in the trunk Heidi cries out startled

HEIDI
Look out

The limb CRASHES TO THE GROUND narrowly missing the boys

Before anyone can react white pebbles spill from the gash in
the trunk and cascade to the ground CLICKING and BOUNCING
like hailstones scattering everywhere

FRITZ
What the hell

Johann and Heidi descend to the ground Ernst holds one of
the pebbles in his hand He looks at his parents

ERNST
These are theyre

HEIDI
Theyre pearls

They pick up more pearls and study them amazed The pearls
are the size of champagne grapes Johann looks up

JOHANN
(stunned)
But what were they doing in the
tree
HEIDI

They were hidden there they must
have belonged to

JACK
Old Black Mike

Johann nods dazed

ERNST
My God they must be worth a
fortune Were were rich
Father were rich

Johann holds up another pearl This ones even bigger They
stare in amazement

HEIDI
Where do they come from
JOHANN
Ive seen shells on the beach
Everyones eyes meet -- a simultaneous realization
ERNST
The bay

Off the Robinsons suddenly running toward the ocean --

CUT TO

EXT COVE - MINUTES LATER

Large banyan trees extend over the water In quick
succession Fritz Ernst and Johann swing out on vines
soaring high in the air then let go and splash down in the
bay

EXT UNDERWATER â- DAY

They swim through the translucent water

EXT SHORE - DAY

Heidi and Jack wait on a rocky point Heidis long dress is
too cumbersome for swimming Johann and the boys surface

HEIDI
(calling out)
Anything

They take deep breaths and dive without answering Heidi
looks annoyed

HEIDI (CONTD)
All right

She pulls off her dress Shes wearing a not-too-modest
petticoat underneath but her face says Screw this

HEIDI (CONTD)
Come on Jack

She takes hold of a vine and launches herself out over the
water -- SPLASH Jack cannonballs in

EXT UNDERWATER â- DAY
Heidi swims along the sloping bottom Oysters by the

thousands cling to the sea floor Johann and the boys are
trying to pry shells loose but theyre stuck fast

Johann looks over startled by Heidis sudden appearance and
attire Swimming past him she takes hold of an oyster
twists a few times and plucks it with a deft movement

She swims for the surface with the oyster Johann and the
boys copy her technique It works

EXT SHORE - DAY

Johann and the boys clamber onto the rocks after Heidi and
try to open their oysters Heidi gets hers open first They
crowd around

HEIDI
My God

Inside is a humongous pearl
DISSOLVE TO
EXT TREEHOUSE CLEARING - LATE AFTERNOON

Heidi and the boys are in high spirits as they eat oysters
and other island fare around a handmade table and toss pearls
into a bowl Even Knips has joined the party taking great
delight in licking the insides of the discarded shells

Nearby Johann takes a nip of moonshine from the rehabbed
still His face says whoa He fills two hollow coconut
shells from the spigot and carries them to the table handing
one to Heidi

JOHANN
(toasting)
To unexpected good fortune

She clinks cups with him takes a sip

HEIDI
I still cant believe it

JOHANN
All our dreams our wildest dreams
can come true now

JACK
We can sail the world like real
passengers In a cabin with a bed

ERNST
With cooks to feed us and servants
to wash our clothes

FRITZ
Why go on someone elses boat Well
buy our own

JOHANN
Thats the spirit

Johann laughs enjoying his sons enthusiasm As the boys
spin fantasies of riches Heidi speaks softly to Johann

HEIDI
We could go back to Switzerland
JOHANN
(caught off guard)
I guess We could
HEIDI

You dont want to

Johann hesitates In his mind Switzerland was the scene of
his failures He fumbles for a response

JOHANN
No of course We could go
home
ERNST
(overhears )

Home Really
This catches the boys attention

FRITZ
(pumps his fist)
Yes That would be better than
anything

As the boys chatter with excitement at the prospect of
returning to Europe Heidi detects a tinge of sadness in
Johanns expression

CUT TO
SAME LOCATION - NIGHT

Tiki torches cast a warm glow The celebration continues
now in the form of an archery contest -- kids versus parents
A target is drawn on a piece of sail Fritz tests the
tension on a handmade bow

ERNST
I made it tighter What do you
think

Fritz nods approval He notches an arrow aims and releases
The arrow misses He tries another same result Ernst and
Jack groan

JACK
Thats five in a row We havent hit
one yet

ERNST
Neither has father We still have a
chance

HEIDI

All right my turn
Heidi takes the bow while Johann offers instruction

HEIDI (CONTD)
Like this

JOHANN
Right But stand sideways to the
target More like three-quarters
(MORE )

JOHANN (CONTD)
And draw back like this Not too
far Now concentrate Take a deep
breath Hold it

ERNST
(teasing)
Careful mother Dont hit anyone --

Heidi releases the arrow It flies through the air and
THWACK -- hits the target dead center bulls-eye She turns
thoroughly enjoying their astonished expressions

HEIDI
Hmm Not bad for girl huh
(gestures)
Give me another of those Maybe its
just beginners luck

The boys warily hand her another arrow She notches it
pulls back her bow and THWACK -- another bulls-eye

HEIDI (CONTD)
Nope Guess I just have a knack for
it What do you think gentlemen

Johann and the boys stare speechless After a beat
deadpan

JOHANN
I think well save powder and shot

CUT TO
SAME LOCATION - LATER

The torches have burned out The boys are sound asleep in a
lean-to at the base of the banyan tree Its temporary digs
while the treehouse is under construction Several yards
away Johann and Heidi sit in front their own lean-to gazing
out at the ocean illuminated by a FULL MOON

JOHANN
Look at that So peaceful so quiet
Like a sheet of glass Hard to
imagine it almost killed us

Heidi nods snuggles up against him

JOHANN (CONTD)
After we get rescued Im buying you
an archery range

HEIDI
I see And a country manor to go
with it

JOHANN

Sure why not

HEIDI
Johann Im joking

Johann looks at her He turns stares out at the ocean
again a pensive expression Heidi studies him

HEIDI (CONTD)
Whats wrong

JOHANN
Nothing

HEIDI
You do believe well get off this
island dont you

JOHANN
Its not that Its just

HEIDI
What Were rich now Isnt that
what you wanted

JOHANN
I dont know I left Switzerland to
make something of myself If I go
back now Im just a failed inventor
who found a bunch of pearls

HEIDI
Youre more than that Youre my
husband and a wonderful father

JOHANN
And if I cant teach my boys how to
make something of themselves Create
something How wonderful am I then

Heidi takes his hand in hers looks into his eyes

HEIDI
Theyre already making something of
themselves Sometimes its our job
just to get out of the way

Johann stares at her unwilling to accept it

JOHANN
And theyll end up where A ship
needs a captain

She sighs smiles back at him She loves him deeply even if
he cant grasp what shes trying to tell him She takes a
breath cocks her head

HEIDI
I hear a waltz

He looks at her puzzled then smiles He rises and takes
her in his arms They begin to dance to imaginary strains of
music

JOHANN
Youre an excellent dancer Mrs
Robinson Best on the island

HEIDI
The feelings mutual Mr Robinson

Their lips meet in a kiss Heidi pulls him closer As it
starts to get passionate Johann sees something over Heidis
shoulder
JOHANN
(muffled through the kiss)
A ship
He breaks their embrace
HIS POV

several miles away a tall-masted ship is barely visible in
the shimmering moonlight

BACK TO SCENE

JOHANN (CONTD)
A ship I see a ship

Fritz Ernst and Jack snap awake and come running over

For a nanosecond everyone stares Then Johann dives into
his lean-to grabs the pistol and spyglass and takes off like
a bullet across the clearing Heidi and the boys follow

EXT BEACH - CONTINUOUS

Johann sprints across the sand the others following looking
out to sea at the sailing ship They run for the hilltop

EXT HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

They scramble up the steep slope slipping and gasping
leaving Jack far behind Its a mad dash family unity
yielding to desperation

EXT ISLAND PEAK - CONTINUOUS

Johann and Fritz reach the summit Kindling and wood for a
signal fire sits at the ready Johann drops to his knees
spills gunpowder from the pistol onto the tinder and strikes
a spark from the flintlock The tinder doesnt light

JOHANN
Dammit Fritz we need a flame

Fritz grabs two sticks and starts rubbing them together
furiously Ernst and Heidi arrive panting They
immediately assess the problem and join Fritz in trying to
start a fire by rubbing sticks

Johann spills more gunpowder from the breech and tries again
but no luck

FRITZ
I got it

Fritz has ignited a tiny flame but its enough The others
quickly crowd around feeding leaves and branches to help the
fire catch

Heidi picks up the spyglass from the ground peers out at the
ship Its quartering away from them silhouetted in the
moonlight

HEIDI
Its flying a Dutch flag

Johann and Fritz add fuel and blow on the fire until its
crackling Ernst watches the ship dismayed

ERNST
Its sailing away

Johann tosses handfuls of seaweed on the fire sending flames
and plumes of smoke billowing

ERNST (CONTD)
Father its sailing away

Ernst starts waving jumping up and down shouting

ERNST (CONTD)
HEY HELP HELP COME BACK

Johann throws more seaweed on the fire looks out to sea
The ship is four miles away sailing into the night

JOHANN
Goddammit

He loads the pistol Ernst continues shouting
ERNST
LOOK HERE LOOK AT THE FIRE TURN
AROUND

Johann FIRES the pistol in the air and immediately begins
reloading Ernst turns to the others snapping

ERNST (CONTD)
Why are you just standing there

Heidi and Fritz join in waving and shouting at the top of
their lungs their voices growing hoarse

ROBINSONS
OVER HERE HELP OVER HERE

Jack reaches the summit He sees the ship sailing away He
looks at his father anguished

JACK
Why is it going away Dont they see
us
Johann FIRES and begins reloading again The ship is getting
smaller Ernst stops shouting then the others too Johann
lets the pistol fall to his side deflated

They stand there like mourners watching in disbelief The
CRACKLING FIRE sends sparks aloft

JOHANN
Well see another

His tone leaves doubt Ernst turn devastated
ERNST
But weve seen one ship one

ship in six weeks

Johann says nothing They watch the ship dwindle away On
their forlorn faces

FADE TO BLACK
A TITLE CARD READS FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER
FADE IN
INT GONDOLA - DAY
A cramped bamboo enclosure Sunlight enters through the
slats Ernst sits with his knees pressed almost to his chin

He reaches between his legs takes hold of a lever

ERNST
Clear

EXT GONDOLA - DAY

The cage swings and bounces next to a tree then suddenly
jerks forward and accelerates away streaking up the hillside
on a rope track

Its like a high-speed ski lift -- built out of bamboo vines
and ships rigging

The car gains speed Leaves SLAP the outside It moves
faster and higher skimming the treetops

Ernst appears unperturbed by a stone counterweight racing
downhill on a parallel track It shoots past a few feet
away

EXT ISLAND PEAK (SIGNAL HILL) - DAY

The gondola slows near the summit then jerks to a halt at
the end of the rope track Ernst sets a brake climbs from
the swinging cage

A pyramid of kindling and logs rises 15 feet in the air

Behind a wind break a pilot torch burns nonstop always
ready to light the bonfire The torch is fed by a drip of
200-proof alcohol from the rehabbed moonshine apparatus

Ernst ladles rotting berries and sugar cane from a bucket
into the still

He takes out a spyglass steps to the edge of the cliff and
scans the horizon No ships He collapses the spyglass

He goes to a daisy chain of pulleys and blocks through which
the gondola rope runs in bewildering loops and figure eights

The daisy chain determines how leverage is assigned in the
system giving the car an effective weight lighter or heavier
than the counterweight depending on which pulleys are
engaged

Ernst loops the rope around another set of pulleys and uses a
deadeye to take in the slack granting mechanical advantage
to the gondola

He gets in the bamboo car releases the brake and descends
smoothly over the treetops

EXT TREEHOUSE - DAY
The treehouse has mushroomed in size and complexity

Bedrooms on multiple levels fan out around a central
multipurpose room (the parlor) and are connected by
walkways ratlines and ladders The Sea Queen looks down on
an outdoor sitting area There are flower-filled window
boxes a dumbwaiter a millstone turned by the donkey on a
circular track a vegetable garden and animal pens Flying
above it all is a Swiss flag

Its an enchanting sight All the more so because its
believable not a fantasy structure People could make this
Especially people who are clever and resourceful

INT PARLOR - DAY

The room is designed with one wall that can be raised on
pulleys so it becomes an open-air loggia

Jack sits at a desk receiving Latin instruction from Heidi
Knips plays with an abacus made of pearls

JACK

Agricola agricolae agrico
HEIDI

Agricolae
JACK

Agricolam agrico --

(breaking off)
Mother why do I have to learn this
Latins boring

HEIDI
Its the root of European languages
Keep going

JACK
But were not in Europe And no one
speaks it anyway except a bunch of
old monks

Knips chatters excitedly

JACK (CONTD)
(enunciating)
Monks not monkeys

Knips makes a face Heidi looks up sees Ernst coasting to a
halt in the gondola getting out

HEIDI
Im still waiting for that essay on
the English kings Ernst Robinson

ERNST
Youll get it mother Father wants
us to gather quail eggs in the
valley

Hes going over to talk to Fritz who is working in the
garden Jack stands calls out

JACK
Can I come with you guys

HEIDI
No Do your lesson Someday were
getting off this island and you boys
will be civilized if it kills me

She watches Ernst and Fritz head off together an indefinable
furtiveness in their manner that makes her frown

HEIDI (CONTD)
Ill be right back Keep going
agricola

She gestures vaguely heads away Relieved Jack goes to a
terrarium and lifts the lid Inside are spiders snakes and
other critters He takes out a huge snake grinning

Knips SCREECHES and leaps away He hates snakes
EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Johann stirs a bubbling cauldron over a fire Buckets
collect sap that drips from spouts in the trunks of nearby
latex trees Johann sees Heidi coming over smiles

JOHANN
What do you think Have I lost my
mind at last

HEIDI
I dont know Have you

JOHANN
Well its working a little bit
anyway Here

He hands her one end of a rubber string pulls on the other
end to show its elastic properties Heidi looks impressed

HEIDI
Not bad Whats it for

JOHANN
A slingshot if I can perfect it For
hunting But really any number of
things Take off your shoes
(off her quizzical look)
Come on I wont hurt you

Heidi removes her leather moccasins Johann takes them dips
the soles in the cauldron

HEIDI
Johann what are you doing It took
me two days to stitch those

JOHANN
Thats right And youre still
getting thorns in your feet
Johann raises the moccasins and displays their rubber soles
JOHANN (CONTD)
Dries off as it cools Give it a few
minutes
Heidi touches the rubber

HEIDI
Well thank you Thats amazing

Johann shrugs modestly obviously in his element here

JOHANN
Sometimes I wonder what people back
in Bern would say if they saw me now
Old Mr Schultz from the bank

HEIDI
(with a shudder)
Theres a name I dont miss

Their eyes meet Its a painful memory Johann regrets
bringing it up He looks at her senses something else

JOHANN
What is it

HEIDI
Its Ernst Hes neglecting his
studies

JOHANN
Really Well I cant say Im
worried Might get his head out of
the clouds

HEIDI
But its not like him Hes off with
Fritz again Did you ask them to
gather quail eggs

JOHANN
No But they can if they want
Well eat them tonight
(a beat)
Wait Did they say I did

Heidi nods Johann looks at her puzzled

CUT TO
EXT JUNGLE - DAY
Johann moves quietly through the jungle He stops to mop his
brow bats an insect away He cocks his head hearing
something
Theres a CHOPPING SOUND in the distance He moves toward it
stealthily As he gets closer he can hear VOICES He steps
into a clearing and his jaw clenches
ANOTHER ANGLE
Fritz and Ernst are building a dugout canoe in a secluded
cove Ernst uses an ax to chop wood from the dugout while

Fritz attaches an outrigger

Johann steps into view He fights to contain his emotions

JOHANN
Well very good

The boys look up surprised Johann inspects the boat

JOHANN (CONTD)
Youve done good work It must have
taken you some time

The boys are silent for an uncomfortable beat Johann looks
at them accusingly

JOHANN (CONTD)
So were you going to tell us or would
we just wake up to find you gone

FRITZ
Of course we were going to tell you
(a beat meeting his gaze)
We want to sail off the island

father

JOHANN
No Understand me The answer is
flat no

ERNST

We knew youd say that Thats why
we kept it a secret Weve gone out
past the reef twice --

JOHANN
In this Are you out of your mind

ERNST

And it worked Weve got a sail too
We tested it in high winds We can
do this

Johann starts to reply but Fritz gestures angrily

FRITZ
Look at what weve done We built a
treehouse a gondola Youre saying
we cant build a boat

JOHANN
Youre damn right you cant If a
house leaks you get wet You know
what happens if a boat leaks

FRITZ
It doesnt leak

JOHANN
And just where do you think youd be
going anyway
He starts

ERNST
New Guinea We know our position
more or less --

JOHANN
More or less

ERNST
Yes New Guineas a huge land mass
Even if were off by 300 miles well
hit part of it

JOHANN
And then what Wash ashore and
stumble around in the jungle Meet
up with headhunters

FRITZ
Well sail along the coast till we
find a settlement When we do well
send back help Youll be rescued
too

JOHANN
Its too risky I wont allow it

FRITZ
And what about the risk of staying
here This whole time weve seen one
ship One Who knows if well see
another We could die of old age on
this island

JOHANN
I said no -- thats final Youve
done a good job Now paddle it
around to the bay Well use it for
fishing

to leave
FRITZ

You dont want to get off this
island

Johann turns Fritz stands there defiant

FRITZ (CONTD)
Just because you dont want to live
in the world doesnt mean we
shouldnt get to try

JOHANN
Youll stop this instant

FRITZ
No I wont The fact is you like it
here

(MORE)

FRITZ (CONTD)
Theres no money no social position
No one to look down on you

Johann glares then SLAPS him across the face Ernst reacts
Fritzs jaw trembles but he stands his ground

FRITZ (CONTD)
Maybe back home you made the rules
but not here We dont need your
permission Were doing it
He gestures to Ernst

FRITZ (CONTD)
Come on

He turns and leaves Ernst hesitates looking regretfully at
Johann then goes with Fritz Johann looks shattered

CUT TO
EXT TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

Lightning CRACKLES in the sky A tropical storm drums rain
onto the roof of the treehouse

INT JOHANN AND HEIDIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Alone in the room Heidi looks out the window with a worried
expression

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Johann sits on a rock and nurses a flask of moonshine Fritz
and Ernsts outrigger canoe is pulled up on the sand out of

reach of the waves Johann eyes it bitterly heedless to the
lashing rain Heidi steps from the jungle

HEIDI
Johann

He doesnt answer She comes over He keeps staring at the
boat his speech slightly slurred

JOHANN
What kind of reckless damn fool would
sail a canoe like that across open
ocean

HEIDI
You would

He looks at her surprised He scoffs takes a swig of
moonshine

HEIDI (CONTD)
Johann what if years pass and
were still here

JOHANN
Then well still be a family
(beat)
They want to take that apart

HEIDI
Dont they deserve the chance to have
their own family To know the joy of
having children

JOHANN
(looks at her)
You want them to go

HEIDI
Of course not Theyre my babies
But Ill let them decide

He stares at her in disbelief

HEIDI (CONTD)
Dont you see this island is a prison
for them Fritz wants to make his
mark on the world He cant do that
here And Ernst With his
intellect who knows how far he can
go TI have nothing left to teach
him He needs a real education

JOHANN
I know about architecture I can
teach him This may not be the life
we chose but its better than
drowning

HEIDI
Dont you get it Theyre already
drowning Thats why theyre willing
to risk their lives to get away from
here

Johann looks at her angrily takes a final swig and tosses
the flask away He rises unsteadily goes to the boat

HEIDI (CONTD)
(concerned)
What are you doing

JOHANN
What I should have done before Im
launching it

HEIDI
No

She goes after him He takes hold of the boat begins
dragging it toward the crashing waves

JOHANN
Well see how goddamn seaworthy it
is And if they build another Ill
feed that one to the waves too

She tries to block his path He pushes her away

JOHANN (CONTD)
Get out of the way

HEIDI
No I wont let you do this

She blocks his path again but he gives her a shove and she
falls backwards He wheels on her

JOHANN
Get out of the goddamn way

HEIDI
NO YOU HAVE NO RIGHT YOU HAVE NO
RIGHT TO DESTROY THEIR DREAMS
He looks at her in astonishment Shes never spoken to him
like this before He grabs hold of the boat again and begins
hauling it toward the water

HEIDI (CONTD)
NO

She springs at him and seizes his arm pulling him around so
their faces are inches apart Her eyes burn with righteous
fury

HEIDI (CONTD)
You Will Not Do This

Johann stares -- blown away by her white-hot intensity

HEIDI (CONTD)
These are their lives

A beat as Johann sees he is no match for her iron resolve
Breaking her grip with a furious gesture he turns and heads
into the jungle
Heidi watches him go despairing

CUT TO
EXT OCEAN - NIGHT

The Actaeon plows through the stormy night Its bow climbs
the steep face of a wave and CRASHES down into the trough

INT COMPANIONWAY - ACTAEON - NIGHT

A RAT scurries ahead of Adam as he carries a dinner tray down
the tilting corridor stepping over a sleeping sailor and an
unshipshape pile of wet tangled rigging The condition of
the vessel has deteriorated after the many months at sea

Adam turns a corner finds Kilroy standing guard outside the
brig Kilroy bearded his uniform filthy holds up a hand

KILROY
Far enough boy Lets see it

ADAM
Its barely enough for one man sir

Kilroy examines the tray Its slim pickings -- a slice of
moldy bread a tiny square of meat a cup of water Kilroy
pops the meat in his mouth

KILROY
Go on then

Adam goes to the cell door and opens a slot through which we
glimpse Pointer working by dim candlelight over a map of the
South Seas Xs are drawn through islands on the map
scribbled papers strewn around the cell

ADAM
Your dinner sir

Pointer looks up his eyes burning Hes lost weight and his
clothes are in tatters Ulcers cover his face and hands He
snarls at Adam in a half-mad whisper

POINTER
The island doesnt exist boy Its
a scheme to drive me mad

Adam passes the tray through the slot Pointer holds up the
scorched parchment Bragg took from the bottle He jabs his
finger at the hand-drawn diagram of the stars in relation to
the island

POINTER (CONTD)
See Canis Major yes But it cant
be its impossible

KILROY
Pipe down there

Adam glances back at Kilroy and brings a duck egg from his
pocket Pointers eyes gleam as he takes this delicacy

ADAM
(hissing)
You have to wait --

Pointer cant help himself He CRACKS the raw egg on his
teeth and breaks it into his mouth He CACKLES with delight
yoke dribbling down his chin

KILROY
Whats going on there

Pointer wipes his chin and crushes the shell in his hands
just as Kilroy comes over shoving Adam aside and peering
through the slot Kilroy glowers at Pointer

KILROY (CONTD)
Back to work or its another beatin
for you

Kilroy returns to his post as Adam retreats down the
companionway Pointer sits at the desk brushing eggshell
fragments from his hands He looks down at the desk

CLOSER

The shell fragments have landed to one side of the scorched
parchment in such a way as to fill out the constellation
diagram Only now the constellation is different

Pointer frowns It isnt Canis Major anymore He nudges one
of the shell fragments with a pen then draws lines between
the points The resulting diagram is a centaur

Pointer jumps to his feet goes to the cells tiny porthole

CUT TO
EXT BEACH - DAY
The outrigger canoe sits at the waters edge Heidi and Jack

are seeing Ernst and Fritz off helping them load gear and
provisions

HEIDI
Remember your first aim is the
shipping lanes If you see a ship

light one of the smudge pots

FRITZ
We know mother It was our idea

HEIDI
I dont have to remind you you dont
have enough water

ERNST
We know that we have pots to collect
the rain Weve planned this a long
time

HEIDI
Youre sure you have enough pearls
You may need them to pay your passage
on a ship

FRITZ
Mother We have plenty With what
we have we could probably buy New
Guinea

Overcome with emotion Heidi fights back tears

HEIDI
Boys I need to know that you really
want to do this That this is more
important than anything that you
understand the risks because
because maybe your father is right

Ernst takes Heidis hand looks at her reassuringly

ERNST
We do want to do it Yes

She looks at Fritz He smiles fondly

FRITZ
Mother Were going to be fine

Heidi exhales She takes an oilskin bundle from the sand and
hands it to Fritz

HEIDI
Take this

Puzzled Fritz unwraps the bundle to find the pistol inside
The boys look at her amazed

FRITZ
Mother no This is all you have to
defend yourself

HEIDI
Keep it dry You can signal with it
if you see a ship
(meets their gaze)
Your father wants you to have it

Fritz looks at her nods He rewraps the pistol

ERNST
Will he ever forgive us

HEIDI

Its not you hes afraid to forgive
Its himself He loves you So much
that he cant bear to let you go

(a beat)
Someday I hope you have children of
your own Then youll know just how
much he loves you

Heidi embraces both boys tightly They drop to their knees
and give Jack a hug A tear runs down Jacks cheek

ERNST
Were leaving you in charge Jack
Take care of mother and father

JACK
When the ship comes do you think
theyll let me take Knips

ERNST
Sure they will If they dont the
hell with em Well wait for
another

Jack nods bravely Fritz and Ernst push the boat out through
the light surf and jump aboard Ernst waves

ERNST (CONTD)
Dont worry mother The first leg
is easy Well be in the lee of the
island all day

Heidi and Jack wave Fritz raises the sail and the boat
begins to move away

ANOTHER ANGLE

reveals Johann watching from behind a scrim of trees His
face is heartbroken his eyes moist He turns and heads
away
DISSOLVE TO
EXT OCEAN - A SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY
Fritz and Ernst coast along a mile from the dramatic

shoreline Steady wind fills the sail The boat rises and
falls on the large but orderly swells

DISSOLVE TO

EXT OCEAN - DAY

Fritz mans the tiller and drinks from a gourd canteen as they
sail Ernst tries to take a reading with the sextant but
the sideways swells are bigger making it difficult

ERNST
I cant get a reading Try pointing
us into the waves

FRITZ
What for We know where we are

ERNST
Because I need practice

Fritz moves the rudder aiming them into the waves He looks
at the island while Ernst tries again with the sextant

FRITZ
Were making good time

Ernst peers through the sextant Fritz eyes a rocky cape in
the distance

FRITZ (CONTD)
We come around that cape we could
pick up some wind

As if on cue a gust wallops the sail It happens so fast
that Ernst nearly drops the sextant

ERNST
Hey

FRITZ
Whatd I tell you Hang on

The boat rides up and over the waves After the initial
surprise its a kick in the pants Fritz pumps his fist

FRITZ (CONTD)
I told father she was seaworthy

Fritz laughs The sail strains from the force of the wind
The outrigger rises up out of the water

ERNST
Weve got too much sail

FRITZ
No we dont

Fritz lets out a howl of glee The boat is really flying

ERNST
We need to reef it

He crawls aft to reef the sail A sudden wind shift throws
him off balance and he grabs the outrigger boom to keep from
falling He ties off the halyard

Fritz is looking back over his shoulder troubled A long
slick of brown foam and leafy debris is being swept along on
the water A coconut bobs on the surface

ERNST (CONTD)
What is it

FRITZ
Current I guess And were in it

They turn to look the other way Although they are still a
half-mile from the cape the current is sweeping them toward
it Waves crash against the rocks Ernst looks concerned

ERNST
Aim higher into the wind Well sail
around it

Fritz moves the rudder tries to steer crosswise to the
current but theyre still being swept sideways by it The
rudder VIBRATES from the force of the water

ERNST (CONTD)
Cmon

FRITZ
Im trying Its pushing us in

Ernst looks toward the cape The boat is crabbing sideways
Theyre both scared now but trying not to panic

FRITZ (CONTD)
Dip your paddle Use it as a rudder

Ernst sticks his paddle in the water using it as another
steering device to stop the sideways slippage The far side
of the cape is revealing itself as they get closer

ERNST
(tensing)
Hey Fritz

Fritz follows his gaze reacts
THEIR POV - THE BREAKERS

coming into view as they round the cape These are no
ordinary waves Theyre 40 foot monsters that CRASH against
a barrier reef with a sound like LIQUID THUNDER From where
the waves break to the shore is a mile of churning white
water studded with boulders

BACK TO SCENE

Ernst and Fritz are being swept right toward the breaking
waves

ERNST
Turn us around

FRITZ
Too late Well smash against the
rocks Paddle

Ernst sees hes right Theyre committed He grabs his
paddle digs in

ERNST
Aim higher

Fritz hauls in the sail They are already impossibly close-
hauled vying desperately to steer away from the breakers
The rudder VIBRATES from the current

Ernst paddles for all hes worth The boat rides up the face
of a huge swell and teeters on the crest before the bow comes
down with a SPLASH

The current forces them closer and closer to the break zone

ERNST (CONTD)
Were not going to make it

FRITZ
Yes we will Stroke

Suddenly the rudder SNAPS clean off

Fritz gives a startled cry Ernst whirls registering the
sudden stall in forward motion The bow is swinging lazily
into the wind

They are rudderless out of control They stare dumbly at
the rudder floating a few feet away then look toward the
breakers and grab their paddles

They paddle like crazy But now the boat is totally at the
mercy of the current Theyre drifting right into the break
zone A huge wave looms They aim straight for it

Miraculously they ride up the face of the wave and SPLASH
down safely on the other side Another wave rolls toward
them This one is bigger Its starting to break

FRITZ (CONTD)
Well punch through it

They dig in with their paddles The wave is curling as it
reaches them For a moment it looks like they really will
knife through it

Then it CRASHES down on the boat

Just like that the boat is gone No sign of it Just
brilliant white water Two boys and a flimsy boat swallowed
by the sea

IN A SERIES OF UNDERWATER AND SURFACE SHOTS

The CAMERA is spun in a watery centrifuge A foot flies into
the air then is gone The pistol and sextant vanish in the
turbulence Pearls spill from a drawstring bag Fritz is
thrown to the bottom with a THUMP Ernst breaks the surface
gasps then is forced down again Fritz somersaults like a
rag doll and SMACKS a submerged rock blood misting away

ERNST

breaks the surface coughing and sucking for air Hes
pulled down again then shoots up 20 feet away He fights to
stay atop the boiling shore break

A swell picks him up hurls him like a cork against the
rocks He tries to hang on but is swept away and goes under
again The terrifying process repeats

He reappears closer to shore but the receding flow pulls him
back before another frothy swell launches him into the
shallows

He gets to his feet dazed and choking stumbles through the
rocks and collapses on shore He lies there chest heaving
clutching his battered sides

ERNST
Fritz Fritz

After a beat he sits up Scrapes and bruises cover his
body He looks seaward searches for Fritz

ERNST (CONTD)
Fritz

Fritz is nowhere to be seen Ernst staggers to his feet
Theres nothing but angry ocean

ERNST (CONTD)
Fritz

He supports himself against a rock In a moment he leaps
back to his feet This time his voice is filled with rage

ERNST (CONTD)
This isnt a joke goddammit Where
are you

He collapses against the rock again lets out a choked sob

ERNST (CONTD)
FRITZ YOU BASTARD ANSWER ME

Tears begin to roll down his cheeks
ERNST (CONTD)
Oh God please God dont let him
die

Fighting back his emotions he rises and starts to call out
again then goes still

ANGLE ON FRITZ
standing on the shore and looking out to sea 500 yards away
BACK TO ERNST

Ernst stares in amazement a huge smile spreading across his
face He makes a bullhorn with his hands

ERNST (CONTD)
FRITZ

Fritz looks over A beat as he appears to struggle to
convince his disbelieving eyes this is really Ernst calling
out to him

Then in a pantomime of thanks to God Fritz comically falls
back on the sand and thrusts his arms to the sky

Ernst grins and starts walking over
EXT SANDY COVE - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

Fritz lies on his back staring up at the sky His clothes
are shredded blood is caked in his hair and on one arm He
looks over as Ernst comes trudging across the sand

FRITZ
I thought you were dead

ERNST
I thought you were dead

Ernst sits They are silent for a beat Ernst pours sand
through his fingers

ERNST (CONTD)
(deadpan)
Hey Fritz I have an idea

FRITZ
Yeah

ERNST
Lets build a boat and sail off the
island

FRITZ
An outrigger with a sail So shell
be seaworthy

ERNST
Yes and well go to

FRITZ and ERNST
- NEW GUINEA

They crack up Ernst drops back against the sand
ERNST

For the record this was your
brilliant idea

FRITZ
Nonsense It was yours Youre the
genius

ERNST

And youre the one driven so insane
by the absence of girls on this
island you decided to risk my life
getting off

Fritz smiles They go silent Fritz reconsiders
FRITZ
You know actually I think the idea
was fathers

They crack up again Fritz exhales

FRITZ (CONTD)
Hes going to kill us

ERNST
No he wont Were coming home
safe arent we

FRITZ
Home

They turn somber reflecting on the meaning of it Fritz
stands He eyes the dense interior of the island

FRITZ (CONTD)
Lets get started We have a long
walk ahead
Ernst rises brushes off sand Fritz looks down the shore

FRITZ (CONTD)
Hey look

Ernst turns A piece of their shattered boat is washed up on
a finger of rocks

FRITZ (CONTD)
Lets see what else washed up

They go over Bits of rigging and sail are tangled together
with the shattered hull Ernst sees the gourd canteen

ERNST
We can use this

He picks it up Water gushes out of a hole in the bottom
He tosses it away

FRITZ
(suddenly)
Get down

Fritz shoves Ernst down behind a rock Ernst starts to
protest but Fritz is peering over the rock Ernst follows
his gaze

THEIR POV - A SHIP

anchored in a sheltered cove The ship has seen some rough
sailing but theres no question Its the Actaeon

BACK TO SCENE
Fritz and Ernst stare

ERNST
Thats the ship that attacked us
What are they doing here

Fritz shakes his head no clue He indicates for Ernst to
follow and they move closer staying low They duck behind
another rock

When they peer around it a dozen sailors are descending a
Jacobs ladder getting into a longboat Even at a distance
its clear the man in the stern is Bragg

ERNST (CONTD)
Thats him isnt it

Fritz nods The sailors begin rowing to shore Rifles
bristle above the rowers heads There are other faces we
recognize -- Donegal Crumley and Adam Pointer is holding a
map looking around

FRITZ
It could be a hunting party Maybe
they need fresh water

He doesnt sound too sure of it Ernst and Fritz trade a
look nod silent agreement and slip into the jungle

They begin working their way around to the cove

EXT COVE - DAY

The sailors get out in the shallows and haul the longboat
onto the sand They are rough and disorderly all decorum
shot to hell

Bragg moves past them onto the beach barking orders
ANOTHER ANGLE

reveals this is Ernst and Fritzs POV as they lie prone under
a mango tree too far away to make out any words

ERNST
(whispering)
What are they doing

Fritz shakes his head mystified They watch Adam set up a
folding table on the sand He places an oilskin bag on it

FRITZ
Thats the boy I told you about I
thought he was a prisoner

Fritz motions for Ernst to follow

FRITZ (CONTD)
Cmon lets try to hear what theyre
saying

Fritz and Ernst crawl forward on their stomachs staying
hidden in the brush

Without warning Kilroy raises his rifle and FIRES into the
trees He shares a guffaw with his mates turns impatiently
to Adam

KILROY
Well come on It wont put itself in
the boat you lazy git

Adam goes over picks up the bloody carcass of a tropical
bird and carries it to the boat

THE BEACH

Bragg looks on as Pointer uses a compass and studies his map
looking around at various geographical features Pointer
looks like hes aged a decade

BRAGG
Youre sure this is Melvilles
island

Pointer doesnt answer at first taking another compass
reading wetting his lips nervously

ANOTHER ANGLE

Ernst and Fritz lie prone in the bushes within earshot
Ernst looks at his brother mouths Melville Fritz shrugs

BACK TO SCENE
Bragg looks at Pointer impatiently

BRAGG (CONTD)
Well

Pointer summons his courage
POINTER
You said if I found the island youd
grant me my freedom

BRAGG
Yes so

POINTER
But I have no guarantee

BRAGG
(furiously indignant)
Are you actually questioning my word
as a gentleman

POINTER
No sir I would never

BRAGG
(biting off the words)
Then is this or is it not Melvilles
bloody island

POINTER
It is

Bragg eyes him a beat then draws his pistol and FIRES
Pointer falls dead the map in his hand

BRAGG
Insolent toad

FRITZ AND ERNST
react to the cold-blooded killing aghast
ADAM THE CABIN BOY

also reacts with horror PUSH IN on his face as he bites his
lip his eyes darting between Bragg and the dead navigator

BACK TO BRAGG

turning to his men

BRAGG
Very well men We begin searching
immediately --

He breaks off as Adam suddenly bolts across the sand seizes
the map from Pointers dead hand and runs for the trees He
stands there a beat astonished Then quickly recovers
roaring

BRAGG (CONTD)
STOP HIM

Adam feints around sailors trying to block his path and slips
into the trees Bragg and the sailors take off in pursuit

FRITZ AND ERNST

see their chance to make an overdue escape They leap to
their feet run for it

INT JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Adam sprints uphill through the thick brush fleeing for his
life

THIRTY YARDS AWAY

Ernst and Fritz run sideways up the same hill Fritz hears
BRANCHES CRASHING looks across the slope to catch glimpses
of Adam sprinting in the same direction

FRITZ
Hey Hey

Adam looks over alarmed by the sight of them He runs
faster climbing away

FRITZ (CONTD)
HEY

Adam runs for all hes worth Fritz kicks it in high gear
climbing to intercept the cabin boy

ADAM

leaps a stream and scrambles up the bank His feet slip in
the mud He struggles higher then freezes Fritz stands
before him blocking his path

FRITZ (CONTD)
Dont worry -- we wont hurt you

ADAM
No no you stay away

Adam backs away then sees Ernst coming up behind him
raising both palms in a placating gesture They can hear a
RIVER RUSHING beyond a rise just out of sight

ERNST
We can help you we know the island
Come with us

Adam swallows Theres fear in his eyes but hes beginning
to relent Ernst takes a step closer Adam hauls off SOCKS
him in the nose

Ernst stumbles backwards and Adam takes off again plunging
through the trees

Ernst jumps to his feet clutching his nose wipes away a
trickle of blood

ERNST (CONTD)
Im going to kill the little runt

Ernst and Fritz bolt after him

EXT RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

Adam jolts to a halt The river is a torrent Although only
20 feet across its set in a deep gorge He stares
gulping
Ernst and Fritz fly out of the trees and tackle Adam to the

ground behind a boulder Adam tries to break free but Ernst
pins his arms while Fritz cocks a fist in his face

ADAM
Let me go dammit

FRITZ
(hissing)
You can have us Or you can have
them

Ernst rotates Adam forcibly so he can peer through the brush
and see Donegal and two sailors grunting their way up the
hill 200 yards away

Adam stops struggling A beat then Ernst releases him

ADAM
(voice low)
Who are you

FRITZ
Fritz Ernst We were aboard the
Bristol I saw you through the
porthole

Adam looks at him the memory returning

ADAM
You look different

FRITZ
We shipwrecked here

ADAM
Theres more of you

FRITZ
Our parents and a little brother We
have to get back and warn them about
the pirates

A bullet RICOCHETS off the rock They whirl to see a BIG
BASTARD OF A SAILOR hurriedly reloading his pistol 100 feet
downhill

FRITZ (CONTD)
Cmon

They run to the edge of the gorge The river THUNDERS below
There are vines hanging from a tree near the gorge Some of
the vines have GOLD FLOWERS some have WHITE FLOWERS

Fritz grabs hold of a vine with gold flowers The sailor is
climbing toward them for a better shot

FRITZ (CONTD)

(to Adam)
Ill go first Remember use the
gold Gold is bold got it

ADAM
Gold is what

FRITZ
Gold is bold Use the gold

Adams head spins Fritz gets a running start swings on the
gold-flowered vine across the gorge and lands on the other
side

He grabs rocks from the ground and begins pelting the sailor
on the hillside Ernst grabs another gold-flowered vine
extends it to Adam

ERNST
Your turn Go

ADAM
(scared stalling)
No I cant

ERNST
Yes you can Its easy Watch

He pushes off swings across the gorge and sticks the landing
like Fritz They rain rocks on the advancing sailor

ERNST (CONTD)
Come on

Adam takes a vine realizes it has white flowers and trades
it for a gold-flowered vine Theres a GUNSHOT and a bullet
SMASHES into the tree

The sailor swears and charges up the hill

Adam takes a huge breath pushes off and swoops across the
gorge landing on his ass Ernst and Fritz help him to his
feet

The sailor reaches the gorge and grabs a vine to copy the
maneuver The vine has white flowers He gets a running
start swings out over the gorge

The vine SNAPS

The big bastard goes into a free fall Its a 150 foot drop
to the river He hits with a SPLASH and is swept over the
rapids

Adam watches the sailor being carried downstream clutching
his white-flowered vine like a prom bouquet

ADAM
(shouting)
Gold is bold asshole

He turns Ernst and Fritz are jogging into the jungle Adam
hurries to catch up

CUT TO
INT RIDGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Fritz stands atop a boulder and peers down the hillside
Satisfied no ones following he jumps down and goes over to
Adam who stands beside Ernst

FRITZ
Were safe for now Maybe you should
tell us what this is about starting
with your name

ADAM
Adam

FRITZ
All right So what are they doing
here

Adam eyes them guardedly Fritz and Ernst wait

ERNST
Look we did just save your life I
should think youd trust us by now

ADAM
Youre right sorry The fact is
theres a treehouse on this island
I need you to take me there Please
I have a map but the part showing
the location of the treehouse was
burned in a fire

ERNST
(suspicious)
Whats so special about the
treehouse

ADAM
Its where the pearls are

Fritz and Ernst trade a look turn back to Adam

FRITZ
What pearls

ADAM
Look if we could just get started
Ill tell you everything I promise

Fritz eyes him closely then nods and they begin walking

ADAM (CONTD)
Its like this Seven years ago an
explorer was shipwrecked here As
recently as three years ago he was
alive hoping to be rescued

ERNST
How do you know

ADAM
Because a bottle washed ashore in
Australia Inside was a dated letter
and a pearl

Ernst holds back a branch Adam ducks under it

ERNST
I heard them talking about someone
named Melville Thats his name

ADAM
Thats right Andrew Melville Lord
Melville really Hes an explorer
geographer any number of things

FRITZ
How come he put the pearl in

ADAM
As an incentive He promised more
pearls to whoever rescued him
(MORE)

ADAM (CONTD)
He said he had a whole kings ransom
of them

ERNST
(figuring it out)
Clever Because without coordinates
he couldnt direct anyone to the
island He knew it would take a lot
of time and effort to find him

ADAM
Exactly All he could do was
describe the island and include rough
celestial observations He figured
it would help his cause if he offered
a reward to anyone willing to
undertake the search

Ernst nods appreciating the ingenuity of it Fritz stops

FRITZ
Hang on

He undoes his fly to pee Ernst does likewise Adam takes a
step away looks around at the exotic setting

ADAM
At any rate the bottle was found and
sent straight to the Royal Society in
London where cartographers went to
work figuring out the location of the
island and dispatched a ship to
rescue him

FRITZ
This Melville guy must be pretty
important

ADAM
(shrugging)
I guess To some he is

He continues looking around at the jungle Fritz and Ernst
shake off and stow their gear Ernst looks thoughtful

ERNST
So really its the pearls that caused
all the trouble Melville wanted to
induce people to rescue him Instead
he induced the crew that was supposed
to save him to mutiny

ADAM
Thats right Once Bragg found out
there was a fortune waiting he led a
takeover of the ship The captain
knew Bragg would kill Melville and
make off with the pearls so he
burned the maps and only a scrap of
Melvilles sketch remained

(MORE)

ADAM (CONTD)
Your navigator was pressed into
service to recreate the work that was
destroyed

Fritz and Ernst look sobered reflecting on Pointers fate

ADAM (CONTD)
So you can see why I ran off Once I
realized this was the island I knew
had to run ahead and warn Lord
Melville

FRITZ
Well it was a good try Too bad

ADAM

ERNST
Because Melvilles dead Probably
anyway Weve been here two years
and havent seen him

FRITZ
And we live in his house

Adam stares Fritz and Ernst turn and start walking again
but Adam just stands there dazed a look of disbelief and
sadness coming over him Ernst looks back

ERNST
You coming

Adam nods slowly follows
CUT TO
EXT SHORE - DAY

Bragg and several of his men are gathered around the sailor
who was swept down river The big bastard looks like a
drowned rat One arm is skewed grotesquely behind his back

He grimaces through the excruciating pain as Crumley tries to
ease the arm back into its socket

BIG BASTARD
There was three of em there was
Not just the one Bloody hell that
hurts

BRAGG
Three

BIG BASTARD
Aye It was the ow damn you

BRAGG
(getting in his face

Melville

BIG BASTARD

Bragg shoves Crumley aside grabs the mans arm and yanks
hard There is a POP The big bastard screeches

BIG BASTARD (CONTD)
AAAAAGHHHH

BRAGG

The big bastard pants recovering

BIG BASTARD

Them boys from the mail ship You

He works his arm Much better Bragg glowers darkly

CUT TO
EXT RIVER â DAY
Adam appears lost in thought as he follows Fritz and Ernst
through the jungle Fritz and Ernst come to a halt jolting
Adam from his reverie He looks past them at a wide muddy

river

ADAM
Can we wade it

FRITZ
Its that or swim

Fritz is already splashing into the river It gets deep
fast Ernst follows Adam stays on the bank uneasy

ADAM
You dont think there are snakes do
you

FRITZ

Could be No crocs though Crocs
are night-feeders

Adam blanches Fritz smiles to show hes kidding
ERNST

Youll be fine My brother thinks
hes funny

Adam manages a half-smile and starts wading across placing
his feet carefully Fritz is already up to his chest

FRITZ
The truth is we havent seen any --

In the blink of an eye Fritz is gone swallowed up by the
river in one gulp Adam gives a start Fritz breaks the
surface treading water

FRITZ (CONTD)
Well I guess were swimming

He strokes across Ernst and Adam push in and swim Fritz
clambers onto the far bank He shakes like a wet dog slicks
water off his limbs He looks down and his face drops

FRITZ (CONTD)
Oh no

Theres a fat black leech on his chest Fritz lifts his
shirt and we see there are more leeches on his torso Hes
covered with leeches

He turns Ernst and Adam are emerging from the water with
irregular black polka dots One look at Fritz and they wise
up to the revolting situation

In an instant everyone is shrieking tearing at the leeches

ERNST
Get it off Get it off

They pluck madly at the leeches Fritz and Ernst strip
naked Fritz tries desperately to reach a leech on his back

FRITZ
Get this one

Ernst yanks it off The leeches leave red welts Fritz sees
Adam feeling under his clothes

FRITZ (CONTD)
Take your clothes off

Adam keeps his clothes on Fritz points

FRITZ (CONTD)
Get them off before they burrow into
your skin Take your shirt off

ADAM
(flustered)
No

FRITZ
Youll never get them off like that

He goes over tries to raise Adams shirt

FRITZ (CONTD)
Ill get it

Adam parries his hand away

FRITZ (CONTD)
What are you doing Take your
clothes off

He tries to remove Adams shirt again Adam suddenly whirls
raising a fist to slug him Their eyes meet and time stops
Fritz just stares and in that instant he knows

She runs behind a stand of trees
Fritz turns to his brother Ernst is slack-jawed having

realized the same thing at the same moment The brothers
stare at each other They look over

Abby (thats her name) is behind the trees undressing
Fritz and Ernst take a few steps to the side peering
furtively around the side of the trees and are rewarded with
a tantalizing glimpse of bare skin

Shes unwrapping a band of cloth from around her chest For
an instant the side of a breast is visible She whirls
grabs a rock and lets fly

ABBY
GET AWAY

Fritz and Ernst duck away With a shock they realize theyre
naked too They cover their privates dart away

CUT TO
EXT RIVER - FIVE MINUTES LATER

Fritz and Ernst fully clothed sit on a rock and talk in
hushed voices mortification sinking in

ERNST
We peed in front of her

FRITZ
We did more than that We stripped
naked

ERNST

I pulled a leech off my

He points helplessly He clutches his head rocking Hes
never going to live this down

ERNST (CONTD)
I think Im going to die

There is a COUGH Fritz and Ernst turn Abby stands there
How they (and we) could have mistaken her for a boy is beyond
imagining Shes not just sort of pretty shes very
ridiculously pretty And without corset shes stunningly
curvy too

Fritz and Ernst stand formally

FRITZ
Hello
ABBY
Hi
ERNST
(mumbling)
Lo

He stares at the ground shuffling

ABBY
My name is Abby

FRITZ
Im Fritz This is Ernst

ABBY
I know

Fritz winces at his stupidity They stand there awkwardly
Abby clears her throat again

ABBY (CONTD)
I impersonated a boy because I wanted
to go to sea I dont think its
fair only boys get to have
adventures

FRITZ
You kept it a secret from everyone
all this time

ABBY
No The captain was a family friend
He said a ship could be dangerous for
girls I pleaded with him and he
agreed to take me on as cabin boy
He alone knew the truth

Fritz considers it then turns to the six foot-high dirt wall
leading up out of the river basin

FRITZ
We should get going Ernst

He laces his fingers and boosts Ernst up the wall then turns
to Abby They look at each other suddenly feeling the
physical intimacy of it awkward

ABBY
Thats all right I can

FRITZ
No here I

Avoiding eye contact she puts a foot in his laced fingers
and he boosts her up For a moment her hip presses against
his cheek the electricity of it registering in his eyes
She pulls herself up Fritz is suddenly short of breath

ERNST (0S)
Hey Fritz get up here

Fritz looks up Ernst sounds alarmed Fritz takes hold of a
root and clambers up the dirt wall to find Ernst and Abby
standing on a knoll looking out to sea

ERNST (CONTD)
Theyre searching for the treehouse

Fritz goes over follows their gaze
THEIR POV - THE ACTAEON

sailing along the coast

BACK TO SCENE

Fritz Ernst and Abby look at one another registering the
urgency

FRITZ
Cmon

They head off at a run

CUT TO
EXT TREEHOUSE - DUSK
Smoke curls into the sky Heidi stirs ingredients into the
pot over a crackling fire Jack shells peas Johann chops
wood with morose efficiency bringing the axe down with more

than necessary force A heavy mood prevails

Knips plays on the woodpile Johann splits a log Knips
jumps closer Annoyed Johann kicks dirt at the monkey

JOHANN
Beat it Knips

Knips moves away Johann gets ready to swing but Knips hops
onto the cutting stump Johann check-swings to avoid hitting
him

JOHANN (CONTD)
Dammit
(looking over)
Jack you want to tell your monkey to
get out of here so I dont take his
damn tail off

JACK
Knips

The monkey runs over and sits in Jacks lap Jack looks
wounded by his fathers angry tone He trades a glance with
his mother

Johann resumes splitting wood then utters a rasp of
frustration and tosses the ax into the woodpile He looks
over at Jack

JOHANN
Sorry I

He gestures extenuatingly Jack nods Johann goes to the
treehouse Jack looks over at his mother for reassurance
but shes watching Johann her face worried

Johann climbs the treehouse steps He hesitates on the
landing outside Fritz and Ernsts room

INT OLDER BOYS ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Johann enters The room feels empty but is still imbued with

the boys contrasting personalities He goes over to Fritzs
bed

On the wall are clamshell replicas of army medals regimental
ribbons woven out of reeds a motto carved on a plaque
SEMPER VALOREM

Johann goes to Ernsts desk opens a notebook Inside are
stunning drawings of faraway places -- landscapes city
scenes the Arc de Triomphe Johanns eyes glisten He
turns the page to find a loving portrait of Heidi

A step CREAKS Johann looks up to see Heidi in the doorway

JOHANN
He never showed me these
(a beat)
Did you know about them

HEIDI
Yes
JOHANN
Why didnt he show me

HEIDI
He didnt want to disappoint you

JOHANN
(disbelief)
Disappoint me But these are
incredible

HEIDI
Its not what he thought you wanted
from him

JOHANN
With his intellect I planned on his
being an engineer a scientist

HEIDI
He would have agreed with you once --
he still likes those things -- but
hes changing
(a beat)

Ernst has a gift from God He is
anything he wants to be

JOHANN
How could I not know this

HEIDI
You never asked him

Johann stares into space

HEIDI (CONTD)
We cant plan our sons lives All
three of them are whatever they want
to be

JOHANN
But I tried I tried to plan your
life too I took you halfway around
the world away from Switzerland
your friends everything you loved
I didnt even ask if you wanted to
go

Heidi says nothing He looks at her

JOHANN (CONTD)
Why didnt you refuse Why didnt
you dig in your heels fight

HEIDI
Because some things arent done Im
your wife I dont get to make those
decisions

He sits there staring

HEIDI (CONTD)
And you didnt take me away from
everything I love Johann I had
you I had our boys

He casts his eyes down ashamed filled with sadness and
guilt feeling unworthy of her love She moves to him puts
her hand on his shoulder tenderly He gazes up at her
choked up barely able to continue

JOHANN
Heidi what I have done to us

VOICES float up from the jungle floor

Johann and Heidi look at each other blinking The VOICES
are animated Theyre out the door in a flash

EXT TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Johann and Heidi come flying down the steps Ernst is
tipping the cookpot on the fire Steam and ash billow
Fritz runs over with a water basin heaves it into the fire

JOHANN
(overjoyed)
Fritz Ernst

FRITZ
Father put those torches out

HEIDI
But what --

She breaks off registering Abbys presence What the hell
Ernst caps off the torches Abby and the boys are winded
drenched with sweat

ERNST
Bragg and his men theyre here We
were coming over the ridge we saw
the ship

FRITZ
Wheres Jack

Johanns head spins He looks at Heidi

HEIDI
Hes he went fishing

Fritz takes off running for the cove Ernst chases after
him Johann and Heidi stare at Abby She smiles weakly

ABBY
Hello

Johann and Heidi trade a baffled look Then they all run
together for the water

EXT COVE - MOMENTS LATER

Fritz comes flying out of the trees and sees Jack
spearfishing from a dugout canoe 100 yards from shore

FRITZ
(shouting)
Jack Get down

Jack looks over His face lights up

JACK
I caught two already What are you
doing back

FRITZ
Get out of the boat

Fritz runs into the shallows and swims for the canoe
gesturing furiously as he gets closer Jack reaches down and
proudly displays his catch

FRITZ (CONTD)
GET OUT

Fritz reaches the dugout and tips it over spilling Jack into
the water

JACK
Hey hey What are doing --

Jack turns sees the Actaeon appearing around the jutting arm
of the cove He blinks then cops to it suddenly and stops
protesting

Fritz rotates the dugout entirely upside-down and they tread
water behind it

FRITZ
Stay down

ANOTHER ANGLE

Johann Heidi and Ernst stay out of sight in the trees and
watch as the Actaeon slinks past the cove the empty dugout
in the foreground

ERNST
Theyve come for the pearls Theyve
been searching for the island all
this time

Johann and Heidi glance over to where Abby is hiding behind
some rocks They still have no clue who this girl is

EXT CROWS NEST - ACTAEON - CONTINUOUS
The LOOKOUT peers through his spyglass at the island
HIS POV - THROUGH SPYGLASS

panning the shore then backing up to focus on a log floating
in the cove It looks peculiar floating there

BACK TO SCENE

The lookout lowers the spyglass and studies the log with his
naked eye then shrugs and continues glassing the shore

EXT EDGE OF JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS

The Actaeon passes behind a headland Fritz and Jack wait
till its completely gone before wading ashore Johann
Heidi and Ernst step from the trees

FRITZ
Mother father -- we didnt make it
to New Guinea

Heidi hugs both boys

HEIDI
I guess we figured that much

JOHANN
Cmere boys

Giddy with emotion he pulls Fritz and Ernst into a bear hug

JOHANN (CONTD)
Can you ever forgive me for being
such a horses ass

Fritz looks at Johann solemnly

FRITZ
Father Im the one who needs to
apologize You were right It was
foolish what we did We didnt get
five miles before we wrecked on the
coast We lost everything including
the pistol

Johann laughs and hugs them again tears rolling down his
cheeks Abby appears from behind the rocks Ernst shoots
her a look embarrassed

ERNST
He isnt always like this

Abby laughs nervously Fritz steps away

FRITZ
Father mother Id like you to meet
Abigail

HEIDI

How do you do miss

ABBY
Very well thank you maam

JACK
I dont get it You brought a girl
back from New Guinea

ERNST
(laughing)
Abby escaped from the Actaeon She
was posing as the cabin boy
Johann and Heidi trade a look finding it hard to fathom
HEIDI
Those must have been some blind
sailors Welcome to our home
ABBY
(blushing)
Thank you maam
Fritz looks out to sea
FRITZ
We should get out of sight Theres
a lot we need to tell you
They move back into the trees

CUT TO
SPYGLASS SHOT
of the Actaeons anchor plunging soundlessly into the sea
EXT HILLTOP - ANOTHER ANGLE - EVENING
Johann lowers the spyglass and hands it to Fritz They lie
prone on the hilltop with Ernst The Actaeon is in a cove
two miles away
ERNST

Theyll split up into search parties

It wont be long before they find us
Johann eyes the ship nods grimly

CUT TO

EXT TREEHOUSE - NIGHT

Light glimmers behind drawn curtains MUFFLED VOICES drift
from the parlor Another faint light comes from Heidi and
Johanns bedroom

INT HEIDI and JOHANNS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Abby sits alone before a mirror She has bathed and wears
Heidis dressing gown Her wet hair lies flat against her
scalp

She studies the girlish face in the mirror with wonder like
someone encountering a long-lost acquaintance

She looks at the vanity table There are clamshells
containing cosmetics made from berries and plant extracts

She applies a dab of red powder to her cheek It goes on too
thick She tries to rub it in but it gets worse She grabs
a cloth and rubs till its gone

She rises from the vanity Heidi has laid out clothes for
her She holds them up then notices the thousands of
notches carved on the back of the door

Abby goes over crouches Sadness washes over her and her
eyes begin to fill as she traces the carved M with her
finger

EXT PARLOR - NIGHT
The Robinsons engage in heated discussion around the table

FRITZ
We need to be bold Look at the big
idiot who chased us today He took
the wrong vine Thats how we can
defeat them

ERNST
By their making dumb mistakes
FRITZ
No -- because we know the battlefield

and they dont Its a basic
principle of warfare

HEIDI
Battlefield Were an unarmed
family

FRITZ

We dont have to be We have tons of
weapons Ernst even knows how to
make gunpowder

HEIDI
(to Ernst amazed)
You do
ERNST

Actually you werent supposed to
know that But yes its pretty
simple Charcoal bat poop and
sulfur

JACK
Bat poop

Ernst shrugs Heidi and Johann trade a look that says Is
there anything this kid doesnt know Fritz picks up the
argument again

FRITZ
Well I say we fight them And I say
we can win Right father

Before Johann can answer the door opens and Abby enters
Everyone stares Heidi draws an audible breath

Abby might as well be a different person She wears a simple
dress thats modest enough but doesnt hide her figure Her
skin glows her hair is brushed to a sheen

ABBY
Uh hi

She stands there self-conscious Her eyes meet Fritzs
Heidi clears her throat Johann and the boys shoot to their
feet

HEIDI
Abby come in My family seems to
have lost its manners You look
lovely

ABBY
Thank you maam It feels good to
be clean again

Heidi shows Abby to a chair They all sit

ABBY (CONTD)
Im afraid Ive brought nothing but
trouble to this island

HEIDI
Dont be silly Its not your fault
Youre with us now

ERNST
Well with us or without us we still
dont have a plan Father what do
you think

All eyes turn to Johann He has been silent till now He
measures his words carefully

JOHANN
Well I think were a family And
we need to agree as a family Our
lives are at stake I cant make
this decision for us

The others exchanges glances Fritz speaks for the group

FRITZ
But we cant agree Cmon father
what do you think we should do

A beat -- as Johann weighs it

JOHANN
It seems to me if we fight them
well lose

ERNST
(vindicated)
See I knew father would take my
side So its settled well head
for the interior --

JOHANN
On the other hand if we hide out
theres no guarantee we wont have to
fight anyway if Bragg comes looking
for us He might decide he doesnt
want any witnesses

The Robinsons look confused
HEIDI
I dont understand Johann Then
what are you suggesting

Johann looks at Abby

JOHANN
Abby you know the Actaeon Ina
pinch how many could sail it

ABBY
In a pinch I dont know I
suppose using just the mainsail

six
Johann nods looks around the table
JOHANN

So how about it Whos for stealing
their ship

The Actaeon is anchored in the cove Three longboats row
toward shore each with seven or eight armed men Bragg in

INT HEIDI and JOHANNS BEDROOM - DAY

Bragg KICKS open the door and steps inside Theres no one
here His surly gaze takes in the clever homemade decorating
touches He turns goes to the landing

EXT TREEHOUSE LANDING - DAY

Bragg takes in the scene below Sailors are scavenging the
site carrying away plunder He scans the treetops
suspicious Hogg the hulking giant climbs the steps toward
him

HOGG
Beg your pardon sir Ill just see
if theres any valuables worth
taking

He squeezes past Bragg goes to Heidis dresser Bragg
descends the stairs

INT PARLOR - DAY

Sailors ransack a cabinet for provisions rip into sacks and
release airbursts of flour and sugar A bear of a sailor
gorges on dripping honeycomb Another samples from a cask

RUM SAILOR
Gor Its rum

The sailors ditch everything and fight for turns at the
spigot They stop suddenly as Bragg appears in the doorway
They clear a path

OBLIGING SAILOR
A drink Capn

Bragg says nothing Another sailor chimes in
SYCOPHANT SAILOR
Cleared out in a hurry they did
Didnt want no truck with you I
should say not sir
Bragg turns and leaves The sailors resume squabbling

VARIOUS SAILORS
Hey its my turn I had it next

EXT SWIMMING HOLE - DAY
An obese sailor floats on his back and another scrubs his

pits under the waterfall while a third pisses in the
shallows Bragg eyes it all with a brooding expression

EXT TREEHOUSE - DAY

Donegal gnaws a stick of jerky Bragg comes over crouches
and holds his hand over the ashes in the fire ring

DONEGAL
Aye sir it hasnt been long What
do you think

Bragg shakes his head doesnt know what to think He
stands A HAIRY APE OF A SAILOR indicates the treehouse

HAIRY APE
Its not half-bad you know Built
out of spare bits I always wanted
to build something with me hands
never had the time

Bragg gives him a withering look

HAIRY APE (CONTD)
All Im saying its ingenious
really And someones got a real
eye You should see what they did
with the curtains

He trails off Bragg is really glaring now

Braggs gaze returns to the treehouse He frowns at
something goes over and peers up at the underside of the
parlor

Nails have been pulled almost completely from the joists

His eyes narrow A length of sturdy twine runs from a wooden

block under a joist The twine joins with others coming from
elsewhere in the structure and disappears into the foliage

Bragg reacts jumping away

BRAGG
LOOK OUT

ON A BRANCH HIGH IN THE TREETOPS
Fritz yanks hard on a whole braid of twine
THE FLOORS

of the multi-room treehouse swing open all at once like trap
doors and send the sailors into free-fall

The startled sailors CRASH to the ground furniture bedding
and crockery raining down on and around them Hogg SMACKS
the turf wearing Heidis nightie over his clothes

Bragg leaps away from the wreckage whipping around
searching the trees He points suddenly

BRAGG
THERE

Donegal and another crewman FIRE their rifles into the trees
IN THE TREES
Bullets POCK the trunk Fritz takes hold of a vine and
pushes off swinging out over the jungle grabbing another
vine and swinging again
ON THE GROUND
Bragg barks at his men as they stagger from the wreckage
BRAGG
On your feet After him Harrow

signal the men in from the ship

HARROW a hatchet-faced sailor runs to the cove Bragg
looks at Donegal jabs a finger at the treehouse

BRAGG (CONTD)
Burn it

Donegal smiles happy to oblige

IN THE SWIMMING HOLE

The sailor who pissed in the shallows looks up as Fritz
swoops out of the trees aiming a furious mid-air penalty
kick to his jaw

Fritz connects -- CRACK The pisser drops

The other sailors splash ashore The obese sailor sees Knips
climbing a tree with their clothes

OBESE SAILOR
HEY

The naked sailors give chase
JUNGLE

Fritz drops to the ground and takes off through the jungle
dashes across a rope bridge spanning a broad riverbed

Under the bridge the river is barely a trickle Heidi lurks
behind a rock on the other side ready with an ax to eighty-
six the bridge

Bragg and a dozen men run for the bridge At the last
instant Bragg sees the trap and jerks to a halt motioning
the others to stop

He raises his rifle but Heidi ducks out of sight He looks
down at the piddling stream

BRAGG
This way

They pick their way down the bank splash into the stream
When theyre halfway across Heidi lets rip with a SHRILL
WHISTLE through her fingers

UPSTREAM

Johann touches off a fuse hightails it

NEAR THE ROPE BRIDGE

Heidi Fritz Ernst Abby and Knips scoop up handfuls of rock
and rain them down on the sailors In a moment Johann
arrives and joins in Jack fires arrows from his bow

The crewmen shrink away trapped in the riverbed shielding
themselves A flimsy arrow glances off Braggs arm a stone

strikes his chest He snatches a pebble from midair stares
at it

He wheels on his men disgusted

BRAGG
THEYRE PEBBLES DAMMIT

Suddenly there is a FIERY EXPLOSION

The sailors pivot to see the dam above them fly to pieces in
an eruption of rock and dirt followed by a ROARING WALL OF
WATER pushing huge chunks of debris downstream

The panicked sailors bolt for safety

Some are carried away instantly Others jump to the bank and
cling to trees Another takes off downstream ahead of a cart-
wheeling tree stump like a rabbit trying to outrun a train

Bragg leaps in the air and grabs the rope bridge his feet
hanging in the torrent Knips dashes out BANGS Braggs
fingers with his fists

JACK
Look out Knips

Sailors are arriving across the river FIRING Bullets
strike near Knips He runs off the bridge takes off with
the Robinsons through the jungle

EXT SIGNAL HILL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The Robinsons reach the summit panting They drop behind a
parapet of boulders Jack suddenly points down the hill

JACK
Look

They turn peering past the boulders

ERNST
They didnt have to do that

THEIR POV - SMOKE AND FLAME

rising above the treehouse

BACK TO SCENE

They look on in silence Knipss eyes express the sadness
they all feel their resolve turning to tempered steel in the

flames

JACK
Its payback Knips

Knips seems to nod Johann looks up sees the gondola cable
wobbling like a line with a fish on the end

INT GONDOLA - DAY

As flames consume the treehouse a SNAGGLE-TOOTHED CREEP sits
in the gondola and wrenches the control stick Nothing
happens

SNAGGLE-TOOTH
Come on damn you Bloody âell you
piece a --

The gondola takes off with a WHOOSH The sailor is thrown
back in the seat gives a shriek of surprise The car races
over the treetops

After the initial shock the creep starts enjoying the ride
The car rockets higher really picking up speed He cackles
with demented glee Then his smile fades

The stone counterweight is racing downhill on its parallel
track but somehow it seems too close He tilts his head
like a puzzled dog eyes it crookedly

The counterweight BLASTS into the gondola

EXT SIGNAL HILL - DAY

The Robinsons witness the impact without comment no one
shedding a tear for this jerk Fritz quickly secures a heavy
chain to the gondola rope Johann looks down the hill

JOHANN
Theyre coming Everyone in

He drops down behind the boulder The Robinsons move to
assigned stations behind the parapet

DOZEN MONKEYS scamper over and join their cousin Knips on the
firing line
BASE OF HILL

Bragg raises his sword in the air

BRAGG
CHARGE

Three dozen sailors emerge from the trees and start running
up the rocky slope yelling WAR CRIES and brandishing rifles
sticks and clubs

ON THE HILLTOP

A bullet SINGS off the rock The Robinsons stay low
waiting The HOWLS are closer Jack hands out bulging
leather sacks to the monkeys

JACK
All right men Its like this

He takes a handful of pearls from a sack and flings them down
the hill The monkeys love this Leaping about and
somersaulting with glee they fan out to chuck pearls down
the hill

ON THE SLOPE

Bragg leads the assault higher Tiny projectiles begin to
BOUNCE and CLICK off rocks One lands at his feet He picks
it up eyes widening as he sees its a pearl

He looks around in dismay Sailors are behaving like giddy
suckers chasing after the pearls

VARIOUS SAILORS
Its the pearls I got one Thats
mine This ones a honker
BRAGG
YOU IMBECILES CANT YOU SEE ITS A
TRAP
The sailors ignore him grabbing pearls
HILLTOP

Johann sees the enemy fall into disarray

JOHANN
Right flank fire

Heidi and Ernst remove a wooden barrier and send a heap of
boulders rolling and bouncing down the hill

ON THE SLOPE

The men see the rock slide heading toward them and run
sideways on the hill to avoid it the boulders CRASHING down
on stragglers

ON THE HILLTOP

Johann watches them run

JOHANN
Left fire

Abby and Fritz yank away supports and a stack of logs rolls
down the hill gaining speed

ON THE SLOPE

The sailors change directions running back to the middle
the logs OBLITERATING more slowpokes Bragg rages

BRAGG
Go you fools Get them

ON THE HILLTOP

Johann sees them moving higher grouped in the center of the
hill Ernst stands ready at a giant rubber slingshot
stretched between two trees loaded with a squirming sack

JOHANN
Artillery fire

Ernst yanks a cord The slingshot bucks and the sack flies
through the air opening in mid-flight to release snakes
spiders and scorpions

ON THE SLOPE

The attackers freak as critters rain down serpents wrapping
around necks tarantulas and scorpions landing on bald pates

Another sack flies through the air and sends forth more
creepy crawly mayhem Trevelyan howls and dances in a circle
as a black mamba shoots down his bib-front overalls

A third airborne sack fails to eject its payload It lands
like a snug hood on Hoggs massive head and sends him
screaming and running blindly away

ON THE FAR LEFT FLANK

A SNEAKY GOON stays low to the ground and picks his way up
the hill away from the main battle moving rock to rock with
a cutlass between his teeth

ON THE HILLTOP

Johann runs to the gondola mechanism pulls a lever and the
heavy chain we saw Fritz attach earlier begins to pay out
descending on the gondola rope

JOHANN
Anchors away

The gondola rope sags as the Bristols anchor is hauled off
the hilltop and glides downhill at an accelerating clip

ON THE HILLSIDE

Donegal sees the anchor Its moving fast down the slope
just off the ground twirling and bouncing crazily

DONEGAL
GET DOWN

The spinning flukes BASH sailors left and right Bragg goes
flat and the anchor clears his head by inches BLASTS into a
tree and turns it to wood chips

ON THE HILLTOP

Johann lights the fuse on a coconut filled with gunpowder and
hurls it -- BOOM

JOHANN
Fire at will

Its a free-for-all Fritz and Heidi pick off attackers with
bows and arrows Ernst launches hornet nests with the
slingshot Abby and Johann fling coconut bombs

Jack dips feathered darts in a vial of inky fluid and fires
them with his pea-shooter -- PHWT

He almost doesnt see the sneaky goon approaching on his
flank till its too late The goon leaps up utters a WAR
CRY and charges

Jack swings around fires the blowgun The dart sticks on
the guys nose He peers at it cross-eyed Then his eyes
roll back and he falls

DOWN THE HILL

Bragg hunkers behind a rock and takes slow aim with his
rifle He FIRES

ON THE HILLTOP

Johann staggers hit in the shoulder a coconut bomb tumbling
from his hand and rolling away Heidi whirls

HEIDI
Johann

He grits his teeth against the pain pointing frantically at
the coconut The fuse is burning down

JOHANN
Get it get it

Ernst dives for the coconut and flings it down the hill --
BOOM Heidi starts toward Johann but he gestures

JOHANN (CONTD)
Theyre on the move Keep firing

He rips his shirtsleeve for a tourniquet

ON THE HILLSIDE

Bragg shouts to his men as they fan out and begin to advance
on a broad front up the hill

BRAGG
Fan out Surround them

ON THE HILLTOP
Fritz sees the change in tactics and runs over to Johann

FRITZ
Thats it father Theyre flanking
us Lets go

Johann rushes toward the cliff edge looks down to see a
longboat with more crewmen rowing in from the Actaeon

JOHANN
Its too soon We have to wait till
the rest of them reach shore

FRITZ
We cant Theyll circle the hill
and cut us off Take Jack mother
and Abby Ernst and I will hold them
off

JOHANN
But how will you get away

FRITZ
I know a way Father please I
know how to do this You just have
to trust us

A long beat as their eyes meet An understanding passes
between them Mutual respect Father and son as equals

JOHANN
Good luck Im proud of you son

They shake hands Fritz beams and runs back to the parapet
Johann turns away

JOHANN (CONTD)
Heidi were moving out

He goes over to her
ON FRITZ
Fritz drops down next to Ernst behind the parapet and notches

an arrow Ernst sees Johann Heidi Abby Jack and Knips
leaving Abby looks back with misgivings

ERNST
Whats going on

FRITZ
Theyre leaving --

ERNST

He fires the arrow notches another Ernst just stares A
bullet KERPOWS off the rock Ernst winces resumes firing

EXT BACKSIDE OF HILL - DAY

It drops off steeply here Johann Heidi Abby and Jack
descend a bamboo ladder to a ledge Johann takes the ladder
lowers it down to another ledge Abby looks up torn

EXT HILLTOP - DAY

Fritz and Ernst put up a furious fight Fritz rapid-fires
arrows Ernst hurls a coconut bomb reaches for another and
finds the arsenal exhausted

ERNST
Were out

Fritz is too busy picking off attackers to answer Ata
loss Ernst loads the slingshot with loose rocks runs over
to grab some more from a pile

A garrote closes around his neck Hes yanked off his feet
Crumley pulls the garrote tight Ernst thrashes and aims

feeble oxygen-deprived punches His face turns crimson
Crumley grins with sadistic pleasure

Fritz continues to shoot arrows down the hill

FRITZ
Ernst cover your flank

Ernst SLAMS his heel on the dirt but Fritz has his hands too
full to notice Ernst gropes for a rock but there is none
Hes close to passing out

Then a shadow falls Crumley looks up Abby stands over
him

ABBY
Hey Crumley remember me

Crumley looks at her frowns

CRUMLEY
Wait a minute Youre the cabin

Hes about to say boy but trails off confused Abby nods

ABBY
girl

She swings a rock at his head Crumley goes flat Ernst
sits up gasping and coughing Only now does Fritz look
over Hes surprised to see Abby

FRITZ
What are you doing here
ABBY
I dont turn my back on a fight

Ever
She jumps down behind the parapet lets fly with rocks like
an Amazon warrior Fritz looks at her with awe Ernst
points

ERNST
Look out

Fritz turns A band of men are moving laterally across the
hilltop flanking them Fritz turns sees the last of the
Actaeons longboats coming ashore

FRITZ
This way Lets go

Fritz Ernst and Abby run toward the cliff edge

ON THE HILLSIDE

Bragg and his men climb toward the undefended hilltop

EXT EDGE OF CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

Fritz watches waves roll against the headland Ernst and
Abby stand with their backs to Fritz keeping an eye out for

the attackers who will appear any second

Fritz tosses rocks down from the cliff his lips moving as he
silently counts the seconds before they splash into the sea

ERNST
Explain this again What are we
doing

FRITZ

Waiting for a wave

ERNST
So pick one For Gods sake theres
nothing but waves out there Lets
do it

FRITZ
We cant Its too shallow We need
the right one

Fritz tosses another rock counts silently

ERNST
What difference does it make Its a
wave

FRITZ

They come in sets of five The
thirds the biggest except every
other time then its the first We
have to time our drop

Ernst stares Hes trusting his life to this

FRITZ (CONTD)
Tell me something Does a heavier
body fall faster than a lighter one

ERNST
No Of course not Thirty-two feet
per second per second What the hell
were you doing in school

FRITZ
Thinking about girls

Ernst rolls his eyes Abby cracks a smile Fritz turns to
her suddenly

FRITZ (CONTD)
Kiss me

ABBY
What

FRITZ
Were about to jump off a cliff And
I dont know if this is going to
work

She looks in his eyes Theyre the only people in the world

FRITZ (CONTD)
Please If it doesnt I dont want
it to be without ever you know
(a beat)
One kiss before I die

ERNST
Before you die

Fritz and Abby ignore him Their lips come together Its a
long indescribably beautiful kiss

ON THE SEA BELOW

Johann Heidi and Jack have paddled a dugout canoe around to
the base of the cliff Knips is in the bow Everyone stares
upward watching Fritz and Abby kiss high above

HEIDI
Oh my God

ON THE CLIFF EDGE

The kiss goes on and on Ernst stares then reacts as
Bragg and his men mount the hilltop 100 yards away

ERNST
Oh no oh no Hello Fritz
Hello HEY

The kiss finally ends Braggs men are running toward them
Fritz looks at the waves takes Abby and Ernsts hands

FRITZ
Now

They jump off the cliff
The fall seems to last forever The guano-speckled cliff
rushing past is a blur Fritz Abby and Ernst hit the peak
of a super-big swell with a HUGE SPLASH

UNDERWATER

They knife through the water deeper and deeper and come
within an inch of hitting the bottom so close that the shock
wave leaves an imprint of their bare feet in the sand
SURFACE

They break the surface gulping air

JOHANN
This way Hurry

Abby and the two brothers turn swim for the canoe
EDGE OF CLIFF
Maggot is the first to get there He doesnt hesitate

geronimos off Another sailor follows Then a third sailor
jumps This one has a PEG LEG

UNDERWATER

There are THREE SPLASHES in rapid sequence and the men plunge
toward the bottom

SURFACE

Fritz Abby and Ernst climb into the canoe and grab their
paddles Maggot breaks the surface screaming bloody murder
Then the second sailor bawling

As for Peg Leg he doesnt surface
UNDERWATER

Peg Leg struggles to pull his wooden leg from the sandy
bottom Its stuck like a pushpin in a corkboard He yanks
on it in a frenzy

UP ABOVE ON THE CLIFF

Bragg reaches the edge and looks down his face contorting
with rage The Robinsons are paddling away as his own men
tread water and howl like babies

He aims his pistol and FIRES but the shot splashes wide He
hurries to reload sees more of his men running over

BRAGG
Shoot them

They FIRE A bullet gouges a splinter from the dugout the
others miss Bragg stabs his finger at a POTBELLIED SAILOR

BRAGG (CONTD)
You -- jump

POTBELLY
Sir theyve nothing to show for it
but broken bones

BRAGG
JUMP

The sailor gestures wants no part of it Ina fury Bragg
tries to march him to the edge but the guy twists away

BRAGG (CONTD)
Damn you I said jump

WEASEL-FACED SAILOR
Well Ill be Jack Tar theyre
stealing our ship

Bragg lets go of Potbelly whirls The Robinsons are making
a beeline for the Actaeon Bragg stares

Everyone stares If the Robinsons get to the ship theyre
screwed Pearls or no pearls Potbelly stands at the edge
mouth agape

Bragg looks at the longboats a quarter mile away on the
beach He gives Potbelly a push turns to the others

BRAGG
On the double

Potbelly falls Bragg and his men run for the beach
DOWN BELOW

The Robinsons paddle for the Actaeon and dont look back as
Potbelly does a GIGANTIC BELLYFLOP in the waves

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Bragg and his men run pell-mell down the hill and through the
jungle meeting sailors coming the other way

BRAGG
No This way

The sailors look confused but reverse direction
EXT CANOE - DAY

Blood seeping from his shoulder wound Johann grimaces
through every stroke He shoots a look toward the beach

JOHANN
Faster Theyre coming

The Robinsons paddle mightily
EXT BEACH - DAY

Bragg leads the pack racing down the beach The sailors
arriving from the Actaeon are pulling their boat onto the
sand Bragg points at the Robinsons

BRAGG
Theyre stealing the ship

The sailors take one look shove the boat back in the water
and grab the oars Bragg and two more men jump aboard They
row like crazy

EXT SEA - DAY

The canoe and longboat are in a do-or-die race to the
Actaeon

The Robinsons paddle like hell Bragg and his men row like
hell The Robinsons have a head start but their crude
dugout is a pig and the enemys longboat is sleek and fast

They started from different points but the two boats are on
converging courses as they get closer to the Actaeon

EXT BEACH - DAY

Sailors leap in the two remaining longboats (that have been
sitting here) into the surf and grab the oars

DONEGAL
Row hard men Stroke Stroke

They pull on their oars Water shoots up out of holes in the
floors of the boats producing an effect like a whale spout

VARIOUS
What the blazes They put holes in
us
EXT CANOE - DAY
The dugout crashes through swells Spray flies over the bow
A rifle CRACKS Johann turns sees Bragg in his longboat
handing a rifle to a sailor to reload taking another
JOHANN
They cant hit us Were out of
range
Not for long Another BANG He ducks despite himself
INT GALLEY - ACTAEON - CONTINUOUS
A cramped compartment Meat and cheeses hang from hooks
The cook a bloated creature in a greasy apron stirs
ingredients into a huge steaming pot His name is LE BOEUF
He tosses scraps into a barrel teeming with flies

Theres a MUFFLED BANG Le Boeuf frowns goes to a porthole
and looks out His jaw drops He runs from the galley

INT CREW QUARTERS - DAY
Le Boeuf bursts in

LE BOEUF
REPEL BOARDERS

An invalid GORMAN bolts upright in his hammock His face
is swollen from an impacted tooth wrapped like a mummy in
filthy gauze

EXT SEA - DAY

The Robinsons paddle like mad Braggs longboat is closer
now the men rowing with long machine-like strokes

A bullet SHATTERS Abbys paddle and she yelps in alarm

Heidi looks across the water with simmering hatred She
thrusts her paddle to Abby takes Fritzs bow and arrow and
stands in the pitching and rolling boat
FRITZ
Get down mother Its too far you
cant hit them

Heidi ignores him She draws back the arrow aiming high for
distance She squints adjusts fractionally

HEIDI
(quietly to herself)
Dont you dare shoot at my family
A deep breath then she unleashes the moonshot
LONGBOAT
Bragg sees the arrow fly up on a steep trajectory At this
distance hitting anything but water would be a miracle And
yet its coming down coming down coming

BRAGG
LOOK OUT

He ducks and the arrow STICKS in the floor of the boat OS
the rower behind Bragg letting rip with an ungodly scream

UNDERWATER

The arrow juts through the bottom of the longboat

IN THE CANOE

Everyone stares at Heidi in awe The longboat has stalled
sailors missing strokes and jumbling oars as the wounded guy
flails and bellows

Johann looks toward the Actaeon reacts

JOHANN
GET DOWN

There is a CANNON BOOM and grape shot lashes the canoe and
turns the water frothy white Fritzs hand flies to his
temple and comes away bloody

ACTAEON BELOWDECKS

Smoke billows Doing the work of six men Le Boeuf and
Gorman juggle gunpowder grape shot and a flaming torch as
they reload the cannon

IN THE CANOE

Johann digs in with his paddle

JOHANN
Its grape shot Quick paddle
Before they reload

They paddle straight for the ship putting themselves at
point-blank range

BELOWDECKS

Le Boeuf touches off the fuse

IN THE CANOE

Johann slices the water with his paddle throwing his weight
and purposely capsizing the canoe away from the ship
spilling Knips and everyone else into the water The cannon
ROARS

UNDERWATER

Grapeshot SPLASHES in the water and quickly loses velocity
drifting down past the Robinsons

BELOWDECKS

Le Boeuf and Gorman see the Robinsons surface and swim for
the ship

GORMAN
Theyre swimming for the ladder

Le Boeuf smothers the torch in wadding and they run out the
CAMERA staying just long enough to see a wisp of smoke rise
from the wadding

GALLEY

Le Boeuf wrestles the barrel of rotting food scraps to a
hatch and tips the contents into the sea He does the same
with a barrel of putrid meat feathers and bones

SEA

Food scraps litter the surface The Robinsons swim for the
ship Knips riding on Ernsts shoulders Suddenly Knips
CHATTERS points at a shark fin cutting through the water
UNDERWATER

Scraps sink past the Robinsons stroking limbs A fish head
stares at us as it wafts downward A shark SWEEPS INTO FRAME
and scarfs it

DECK

Gorman pulls up the Jacobs ladder just as Ernst swims up to
the hull and makes a grab for it

GORMAN (CONTD)
Ha Try to come aboard now

He cackles sadistically dashes to a longboat davit and reels
in the pair of ropes dangling in the water He runs to
another davit sees Fritz climbing the rope

He pulls back the ratchet and the rope spins out of the
winch plunging Fritz back into the shark-infested water with
a SPLASH

GALLEY

Le Boeuf throws open a porthole and heaves a pot of fish guts
down on Abby Spluttering with disgust Abby sees dorsal
fins slicing through the water toward the oily chum slick

LE BOEUF
Come little fishies

IN THE LONGBOAT

With his men rowing again Bragg grins with amusement at the
Robinsons vain efforts to get aboard the ship

SEA

The Robinsons fan out around the ship Johann swims for the
bow anchor Fritz shouts to Ernst

FRITZ
Give me Knips

Treading water Fritz takes Knips from Ernsts shoulders and
does a water polo throw with the monkey sending him up and
over the railing to skid on his ass across the deck

STARBOARD BOW

Johann climbs the anchor chain A wooden boat hook LANDS
across his shoulders He falls back but catches himself and
clings to the chain

Reaching out over the railing Gorman SMASHES him with the 16-
foot pole Johann catches the pole twists it away and lets
it fall He begins to climb again

Gorman runs to the anchor capstan and releases the brake
The capstan spins The heavy anchor chain rushes out and
SPLASHES Johann back into the sea

PORT SIDE
Knips operates a davit winch and lowers the rope down to Abby

and Fritz Sharks are converging around them in a feeding
frenzy She indicates for him to climb first

ABBY
You go

FRITZ
No you go Go Go dammit

Abby begins to climb
STARBOARD BOW

Treading water Johann reaches up with the boat hook catches
the railing and begins to climb the pole

Gorman runs over tries to pry the hook off the railing but
the weight on the pole makes it impossible and Johann climbs
higher

Gorman waits till Johann is within reach then SMASHES his
knuckles with a belaying pin Johann clings to the pole a
huge shark waiting below Gorman SMASHES his knuckles again

Without warning Abby appears behind Gorman spins him around
and drives a fist into his bandaged jaw Gormans eyes bulge
and he screams She follows it with a kick to the balls

In the next instant Fritz rushes across the deck seizes
Gorman by one arm while Abby takes the other and they send
him flopping backwards over the railing into the sea

Johann clambers onto the deck Heidi Ernst and Jack are
climbing the Jacobs ladder (lowered down by Knips) and
pulling it up after themselves

JACK
We did it Knips youre a hero

They laugh giddy with victory Then Heidi looks out to sea
The longboat has changed course and is making a beeline for
the stern Her face falters

HEIDI
I dont understand They cant come
aboard at the stern can they

The longboat passes out of sight as it maneuvers up to the
stern Suddenly it hits them how the pirates are coming
aboard

JOHANN
Run below grab any weapon you can
We have to fight them on the ship

They run across the deck

EXT STERN - DAY

Bragg climbs a skein of knotted bedsheets hanging down to the
longboat from the window of the captains quarters Le Boeuf
reaches out and helps him over the sill into the stateroom
Down below in the longboat the next sailor begins to climb

INT BELOWDECKS - DAY

The Robinsons tear open lockers in a frantic search for
weapons Jack runs to the gun deck

INT GUN DECK - DAY

Jack comes flying through the door stops dead The cramped
space is filling with smoke Flames spread across the floor

The fire has nearly reached the gunpowder magazine
EXT DECK - DAY
An assortment of last-resort weapons CLATTERS on the deck --

tools empty bottles a bullwhip prosthetic leg fishing net
and other junk

The Robinsons rummage in the incredibly lame arsenal Ernst
tries out a cat-o-nine-tails with a look of dismay Hes
going into the battle of his life with this

Jack comes running up breathless
JACK
Theres a fire in the magazine We
have to abandon ship
They stare at him
INT CAPTAINS QUARTERS - DAY
The last sailor climbs the bedsheets into the stateroom
leaving the longboat to drift away on the current Bragg
loads his pistol
BRAGG
Were taking this ship back No

child Everyone load up

Shadows flit past the window followed by SPLASHES Bragg
and his men rush to the window

THEIR POV - ABBY AND THE ROBINSONS

swimming after the drifting longboat clambering aboard All
except Johann that is Hes nowhere to be seen

BACK TO SCENE
Bragg and his men stare in amazement

WEASEL-FACED SAILOR
Well Ill be Jack Tar now theyre
stealing the longboat

Bragg lets out a growl of animal rage

BRAGG
Fire at will

He aims his pistol out the window Theres a FURIOUS
WHIPCRACK and the tip of the bullwhip flies down and stings
his face He stumbles back from the window roaring

ON THE POOPDECK

Directly above Johann leans out from the railing and CRACKS
the bullwhip down at the window keeping Bragg and his men
from firing at the longboat

Fifty feet from the stern Abby and his family climb into the
longboat Fritz and Ernst dig in with the oars

HEIDI
Johann jump

JOHANN
Row Get out of range

He CRACKS the whip raises it again KAA-BOOOM

The Actaeon ERUPTS IN A BLAST that cracks it open amidships
like a pipe bomb and sends a huge fireball billowing in the
air

Debris flies everywhere A huge column of smoke shoots into
the sky The stern and bow sections form a V and sink toward
the middle

IN THE LONGBOAT

A massive concussion wave races toward the longboat lifts it
up like a bathtub toy and sends it splashing down Heidi
makes a grab for the gunwale searches in vain for Johann
horrified

HEIDI
Where is he Does anyone see him

Ernst points suddenly at the sinking ship

ERNST
There he is

ERNSTS POV
Johann staggers to his feet on the tilting sinking deck
IN THE LONGBOAT

ERNST (CONTD)
Father Were coming

Ernst reaches for his oar but its gone In fact both were
swept away by the tsunami-like wave

ON THE STERN SECTION

Johann grabs hold of the railing signals weakly to his
family Loose objects tumble down the deck and SPLASH into
the water

A hand closes around his ankle yanks him to the deck

Bragg is emerging from the jagged blast hole in the deck He
is scorched and bloody clothes nearly burned off He belts
Johann across the jaw

Bragg stands over Johann panting Johann tries to get to
his feet but Bragg boots him savagely Johanns head snaps
sideways Bragg boots him again then heaves a heavy piece
of the shattered mast and rigging on top of him pinning him
to the deck

Bragg looks over The Robinsons are paddling toward the
Actaeon with their hands The longboat barely moves making
for a pathetic spectacle

Bragg draws a huge knife rests his boot on Johanns chest
Johann struggles but hes pinned helplessly Bragg nods
toward the longboat a malignant smirk

BRAGG
Theyre going to watch you die
goatherd The only question is
whether I let you drown with this
sinking wreck or have the pleasure
of killing you by my own hand

Johann strains with all his might

JOHANN
Go to hell

BRAGG
You first And then your family

IN THE LONGBOAT

Heidi screams as she sees Bragg kneel on top of Johann raise
the knife and start to swing it down for a death blow

ON THE STERN SECTION

Johann manages to barely deflect the blow with his forearm
Bragg raises the knife tries again to plunge it in again
but Johanns face fills with righteous fury

Straining with all his might he frees one arm and hammers
Braggs face with his fist Bragg yowls Johann seizes him
by the hair and smashes his head against the mast -- once
twice three times Bragg stumbles backward shrieking

Johann wriggles free of the mast gets to his knees draws

back a fist and PUNCHES Bragg so hard across the jaw that it

sends him toppling unconscious to the deck

An instant later --

A SHIPS HORN

lets rip with an EARSPLITTING BLARE

BACK TO SCENE

Johann nearly leaps out of his skin whirling

A HUGE RIGGED STEAMSHIP bears down on them fast SAILORS

crowd the railing shouting and waving life rings A Union

Jack flies from the mast

Johann stares Heidi and the children stare Knips stares
CUT TO

EXT DECK - BRITISH NAVY STEAMSHIP - MINUTES LATER

BRITISH SAILORS in spotless uniforms help Abby and the

Robinsons onto the deck The ship sparkles with newness

representing the cutting edge of naval technology

protectively Johann moves to the railing Sailors in

lifeboats are fishing Bragg and a handful of survivors from

the sea taking them into custody

CAPTAIN EVERETT (CONTD)
Captain Miles Everett Her Majestys
Navy I believe you know the Lord
Chancellor

ABBY
How do you do Captain Sir Peter
its so good to see you

The Lord Chancellor bows

LORD CHANCELLOR
The pleasure is ours Mlady Ive
felt for months we were just a step
behind your ship I regret it took so
long

The Robinsons look blown away Ernst looks at Fritz and
mouths Mlady Fritz shrugs clueless

ABBY
Captain Sir Peter -- Id like you to
meet the Robinson family of Bern
Switzerland I owe them my life

LORD CHANCELLOR

It is indeed a pleasure On behalf
of Her Majesty may I express our
gratitude Your ministry in London
will be informed of your service at
the first opportunity

JOHANN
(head spinning)
Well of course great

Abby turns to the Robinsons

ABBY
Mr and Mrs Robinson please accept
my apologies Ive done nothing but
deceive your family I hope youll
let me explain

Sailors bring Bragg aboard the ship in shackles The Lord
Chancellor looks at him with contempt ushering Abby and the
Robinsons away

LORD CHANCELLOR
If I may Mlady there will be time
for that later A matter of vital
importance awaits you

Abby looks puzzled The Lord Chancellor ushers Abby and the
Robinsons head across the deck

INT STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The Lord Chancellor leads Abby into a large well-appointed
stateroom Abby stops in her tracks

ABBY
Father

LORD ANDREW MELVILLE is propped up in bed attended by a
DOCTOR and NURSE A bluff hearty aristocrat with a booming
voice Lord Melville has the look of a classic British
adventurer He breaks into a huge grin

LORD MELVILLE
Oh my gorgeous child

Abby flies into his arms

ABBY
Youre alive

LORD MELVILLE
More so now that Ive laid eyes on
you My God look at the size of
you

Abby clings to her father Her eyes fill with tears

ABBY
I thought you were dead

LORD MELVILLE
And I thought the same of you What
on earth were you thinking joining
the search for me

ABBY
I only wanted to see you father

She turns The Robinsons have been standing in the doorway
watching with amazement

ABBY (CONTD)
Please come in Father these are
the Robinsons They were shipwrecked
on the island They saved my life

LORD MELVILLE
By Jove did you really Outstanding

He struggles from his bed The doctor and nurse react

DOCTOR
Mlord you mustnt tax yourself --

LORD MELVILLE

Oh would you stop Dont you see
its indolence that makes a man
unwell

He stands

ABBY
This is Mr and Mrs Robinson Johann
and Heidi This is my father Andrew
Melville

They shake hands Abby indicates the Robinson boys

ABBY (CONTD)
And this is Ernst Jack And
this this is Fritz

She blushes a little as she says his name A beat as Lord
Melville eyes her trades a knowing look with Heidi and
Johann

LORD MELVILLE
I see I see Well excellent Most
delighted to meet you all

HEIDI
But tell us Lord Melville just how
did you get off the island

LORD MELVILLE

I was blown off course while fishing
one day and spent 55 days at sea
until I was picked up by a trading
junk out of Penang From there I
hopscotched my way back to England
arriving just after this young lady
got it into her head to join the
search for me Fortunately Id been
snacking on oysters the day I was
blown out to sea so I had a few loose
pearls to pay my passage

The mention of pearls has a visible effect on the Captain and
Lord Chancellor who press forward wetting their lips with
anticipation Lord Melville indicates them winks
mischievously

LORD MELVILLE (CONTD)
Speaking of pearls these two lofty-
minded chaps might like to know what
all the fuss is about Purely
scientific of course You did find
that stash I left behind

The Robinsons exchange glances

JOHANN
Yes sir And we harvested quite a
few more of our own

CUT TO
INT CAVE - DAY

Darkness gives way to light as the Robinsons enter with
torches Captain Everett the Lord Chancellor and several
officers follow Lord Melville walks assisted by a cane and
two sailors on either side He stops His jaw hangs open
The others stare also astonished

LORD MELVILLE
Good heavens

CAPTAIN EVERETT
There must be two or three

The Lord Chancellor shakes his head at a loss for words

LORD CHANCELLOR
bajillion

ANGLE ON PEARLS

Far too many to count At least a bajillion maybe even a
kazillion The pearls overflow from buckets spill in great
drifts across the floor shimmering in the torchlight It
boggles the imagination

Lord Melville looks on reflecting

LORD MELVILLE
Funny how these things work The
whole time I was here eating oysters
endlessly collecting pearls I might
have been the richest man in the
Pacific and what good did it do me
I didnt have what mattered most

He looks over at Abby fondly She and Fritz have moved some
distance away and are speaking quietly together

LORD MELVILLE (CONTD)
My my

Their attention is suddenly seized away

ERNST (0S) JACK (0S)
You cant do that Theyre And this is our island
our pearls

Johann Heidi and Lord Melville rush over find Jack and
Ernst trying to defend the pearls as sailors move to
transport them from the cave

JOHANN
Whats going on

JACK
Theyre stealing the pearls Theyre
just as bad as the pirates

The Lord Chancellor looks at Lord Melville apologetic

LORD CHANCELLOR
I tried to explain to them Mlord
This island is the property of the
Crown

(MORE)

LORD CHANCELLOR (CONTD)
Your tenancy made it legally binding
That goes for the pearls too

Heidi looks at Johann with concern

HEIDI
Johann is that true

LORD MELVILLE
No Mrs Robinson It is not

He gives the Lord Chancellor a severe look conjuring the
image of a Headmaster scolding a First Former

ORD MELVILLE (CONTD)
Not sporting Peter You know as
well as I do my tenancy ended when I
left the island --

LORD CHANCELLOR
But Mlord --

ORD MELVILLE

Now if the Robinsons wish to forfeit
ownership of this island and its
pearls only then would possession
transfer to the crown Mr Robinson
its your choice Would you like to
surrender all this to the Queen

Johann and Heidi exchange a look

JACK
What you think were nuts

Melville the Robinsons and even some of the sailors laugh
The Lord Chancellor reddens shuffling cravenly

CUT TO
EXT TREEHOUSE - DAY

Jack speaks to Knips through the bars of a too-small bamboo
cage Knips is the picture of sadness Jack doesnt look so
happy either

JACK
Dont be sad Knips Its just till
we get to Switzerland The captain
says you cant run around on the ship
But youre going to like Switzerland
There are streets and tons of houses
and factories and smokestacks and
freezing cold snow and maybe you
wont like Switzerland

Knips looks at him morosely

WIDER

Johann and Heidi pack their belongings outside the remains of
the treehouse Johann wears a starched shirt and frock coat
and tugs repeatedly at the collar Heidi wears a borrowed
dress that is heavy and concealing

Sailors transport crates of the Robinsons belongings down to
the beach Ernst rummages for his notebooks in the charred
structure talking a mile a minute

ERNST
If that ships as fast as it looks
well be in Europe no time Father
do you think well stop at many ports
of call

JOHANN
(tugging at collar)
I dont know some God what is
it with this thing

ERNST

Well I hope not If we hurry I
could be back for the International
Paris Biennial Do you know Paul
Gauguin is exhibiting there Lord
Melville says hell introduce me
Wait till old Paul hears where Ive
been these past two years

HEIDI
Thats wonderful darling

Ernst finishes packing Sailors are transporting crates down
to the beach They carry away the cage with Knips inside
Jack walking alongside

ERNST
Ill scare up Fritz and tell him
were going Hes off with Abby
again See you down at the beach

He gives a cheerful wave and heads off leaving Johann and
Heidi alone Johann eyes the remains of the treehouse

HEIDI
(re treehouse)
It held up pretty well didnt it

Considering
JOHANN
Yeah
HEIDI

You dont like leaving it like this
do you
JOHANN
Not really But what the hell
Its just a treehouse We can always
come back and visit Its our
island right

Heidi smiles He tugs at his collar again

JOHANN (CONTD)
I dont get why this doesnt fit

HEIDI
It doesnt fit because you put on
muscle

JOHANN

Yeah I guess
They resume packing Then Heidi stops looks over

HEIDI
I need to confess something

JOHANN
(concerned)
What is it

HEIDI
Sometimes I used to think you were
full of hot air

He stares

HEIDI (CONTD)
I cant help it All your talk about
freedom and destiny being your own
man swimming against the
current Honestly I thought it was
a crock

He continues staring wounded She shrugs helplessly
HEIDI (CONTD)
Sorry but its how I felt I didnt
say anything because well it
wasnt my place to disagree
A beat

HEIDI (CONTD)
But then I realized

She looks in his eyes

HEIDI (CONTD)
This is a place where I can be free
-- where I can dress how I want pick
up a hammer and drive a nail and
swear like a soldier when I hit my
thumb Where I can raise my boys
without snobbery and go swimming in
clothes that wont make me drown
This is a place where I can tell my
husband hes a blowhard and where I
can tell him to make love to me under
the stars

Johann looks at her a curious expression

JOHANN
Heidi Robinson what are you saying

She locks eyes with him the hint of a smile forming
HEIDI
I think you damn well what Im
saying Mr Robinson

A beat as a silent understanding passes between them Heidi
moves to him holding his gaze

As their lips come together in a kiss --
DISSOLVE TO
THE BOW OF A SLEEK YACHT
slicing through tropical water
EXT YACHT - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY
Fritz and Abby stand at the bow railing with the wind in
their hair looking several years older dressed casually but

fashionably for the times Fritz holds their lovely two year-
old daughter ROSE

Ernst stands at the starboard railing peering through a
spyglass He lowers the spyglass gnaws his lip

ERNST
I dont see the island

FRITZ
I dont either

They look at each other worried

ERNST
Do you think its changed much

ABBY

FRITZ
Well it cant have sunk below the
waves We know that much right
They trade a look They all seem nervous the way people are
when theyve been away for a long time from a place and
people they love dearly

LOOKOUT (0S)
LAND HO

They turn and look up The LOOKOUT is pointing off the
starboard quarter Ernst raises the spyglass reacts

ERNST
I see it I see it I see it

TIME CUT TO
EXT PORT OF ROBINSON ISLAND - DAY
The yacht glides into this small port Treehouses are
visible here and there in the trees A new dock bustles with
life Workers unload cargo from a small trading vessel
moored there Children play on the sand and splash in the
waves
ON THE YACHT
Fritz kneels beside Rose at the railing directs her gaze
FRITZ
Do you see it sweetheart Do you
know what thats called

A beat -- as Rose forms the word

ROSE
Island

Fritz beams with pride He stands with Abby and Ernst They
search the dock Ernst reacts

ERNST
I see them

THEIR POV - THE DOCK

Johann and Heidi stand on the dock waving They look hale
and hearty Heidi holds Knips by the hand

BACK TO SCENE
Fritz Ernst and Abby wave Ernst looks troubled suddenly
ERNST
I dont get it I see mother and
father I see Knips Wheres Jack

A look of concern crosses Fritzs face

FRITZ
You dont suppose something happened
to him
A beat -- as they look at each other Then a SHRILL WHISTLE

pierces the air They whip around look toward the cliff

ERNST
Oh my God

JACK
stands at the highest point of the cliff He is shirtless
tan and positively brawny He raises his hand in a salute

takes a running start and sails off the cliff

A flip a tuck two somersaults a layout and he
knifes into the water without a splash

ON THE YACHT

Fritz Abby and Ernst stare jaws hanging open Jack is
swimming to the surface grinning and waving

They look toward the dock see Heidi and Johann laughing at
their amazed reactions Knips clapping his hands and jumping
with glee

WIDER

As the yacht glides into the idyllic harbor we PULL BACK
higher and higher until

AERIAL SHOT

We see the tremendous natural beauty of Robinson Island a
tropical jewel in the South Pacific

FADE OUT

THE END
