First Draft
To love is to suffer
To avoid suffering one must not love But then one suffers from

not loving

Therefore to love is to suffer not to love is to suffer to
suffer is to suffer

To be happy is to love
To be happy then is to suffer but suffering makes one unhappy

Therefore to be happy one must love or love to suffer or suffer
from too much happiness”
- Woody Allen Love and Death 1975

The heart wants what it wants You meet someone and you fall in

love and thats that
- Woody Allen as himself Time Magazine August 1992

INT SOME RANDOM WOMANS APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

ANDY MASON opens his eyes He rubs them orients himself and
gets out of bed This is not Andy’s bedroom It belongs to
the sleeping WOMAN by his side Andy is careful not to wake
her as he gets out of bed and puts on his pants

Instead of just you know leaving Andy finds a pen and
paper and writes the girl a note

INSERT “Dear”

Andy stops writing He realizes he doesn’t know the girl’s
name Shit

Andy looks around the room for some clues seeing none
Finally his eyes fall on a small blue Tiffany box on her
night stand Tiffany

Maybe that’s it Andy writes “Dear Tiffany great meeting
you Take it easy Andy” He leaves that on her desk grabs
the rest of his clothes and walks out the door

EXT RANDOM WOMAN’S BUILDING - SAME

Andy emerges half-dressed from the building and walks to his
car In the light we get a good look at him He’s approaching
30 Attractive Charming Guys like him Girls like him a
lot

Andy checks himself in the rearview mirror Likes what he
sees Outside a GUY IN A SUIT passes talking on a cell
phone Guy seems real agitated Andy smiles shakes his head
Turns up the radio Drives off

sleeping lump next to him Remembers

Careful not to disturb her he gets out of bed He looks
around the room -- frilly bedspread pink wallpaper stuffed
bear on the bed -- a real girly girl lives here Andy puts on
his clothes as quietly as possible and heads out the door

On the way down the stairs he passes several hanging photos
of the girl as a child including one with her father HAROLD
late 50s (even in pictures an intense son of a bitch)

Andy smiles -- cute kid Then for a second merely having
these pictures up seems kinda strange Andy blinks Whatever

Braden’s eyes fall on handsome chiseled athletic
homecoming King TIM COOLEY in a crowd of people He seems to
be showing them something from his IPhone A steely resolve
comes over Braden as she heads towards Tim to find out what’s
up Tim doesn’t see her until the last second

TIM

Braden grabs the phone to see what everyone’s looking at
It‘s a video file of Tim in bed He’s not alone And the girl

hallway she tries to keep from sobbing

Biting her lip something catches her eye She stops Stares
Its a picture on the wall of the school’s soccer team from

Braden but he does see all sorts of very young-looking kids
Andy can’t handle it He drives off

ANDY
We should take you seriously

SERIES OF SHOTS ANDY WATCHING CHICK FLICKS

JUMPCUTS of Andy and Braden watching TV in various positions

Braden always seems delighted Sometimes she wipes tears
Andy on the other hand is less enthralled

In the first few cuts Andy just looks bored He‘s falling

asleep

Braden nudges him to pay attention In others he

literally watches with the XBOX controller in hand pressing
buttons like he’s playing a game just to make himself feel

better

ANDY
So painful

BRADEN
Shhh

As it goes along Andy watches the movies and just gets more
aggravated by what he sees For example

the moment where something would happen But here they both
look away Neither one knows what to do

ANDY

to your after party You don’t have
to stay here

BRADEN

quasi-romantic but totally unacceptable way She reapplies
the ice

ANDY

But you know what Somehow I did

Silence for a beat
HAROLD

Andy I can’t say I support this
thing you’re doing with my
daughter But I‘m willing to
tolerate it long as I come home
and see that smile on her face You

ANDY

HAROLD
I’m saying this girl doesnt need
another disappointment in her life
Whatever happens between you two

EXT SHOPPING MALL - LATER

BRADEN
Whatever you want

ANDY
Ha spoken like a 17 year old kid

BRADEN
No Spoken like someone who knows
you And believes in you Who
thinks youre amazing even if

Andy can’t help but be moved by this No one’s ever spoken to
him this way Andy isn’t even sure how to respond He just
turns his attention to the road They drive listening to
more 90s indie rock Braden tries to deal for a few beats
Can‘t

BRADEN
(grabbing Ipod)
( Oh my god give me this
(c ANDY

Hey
Braden hooks her own Ipod up to the connector

ANDY
Don’t even think about putting on
some of that teenybopper crap Not
in this car

BRADEN
Teenybopper Bitch please

ANDY
I‘m serious

BRADEN
Shut up and listen

The song selected is called “She’s Got You High” by Mumm-Ra
It is definitely not what Andy was expecting Braden shoots
him a look that says “try not to like this”

Andy doesn’t say a word He drives As the song picks up
speed Andy finds himself kinda digging it

Still we stay with them Driving in silence Listening to the
song The windows are down and it’s beautiful out

Andy’s right hand taps along with the beat on the gear shift
Its very close to Braden’s on the armrest They may even be
touching

The song builds They dont look at each other But theyre
both smiling

At which point we COMMENCE MONTAGE The song continues over

- Andy and Braden stay in and cook dinner together The
kitchen looks like a disaster area seeing as how neither of
them knows what they’re doing

- Andy changes his “Relationship Status” on Facebook from
“Single” to “In a Relationship” He then changes “In a
Relationship” to “Its Complicated”

- Andy and Braden playing Rockband Guess what -- theyre
awesome now

- Braden nervously parallel parks The DMV TESTER nods in
approval Bradens passed the test She runs out of the car
to celebrate Andys there waiting for her

- Back in the car Only it’s sometime later The song ends
with both Braden and Andy harmonizing the last bit singing
as loud as they possibly can After which they burst out
laughing One might even think they were a real couple
They arrive at Braden’s place and she gets out

BRADEN
Call you later

ANDY
Sounds good

Andy drives off Braden goes to her mailbox Theres a stack
of mail Sorts through it on her way to the house Stops in

Now Andy bounds up the escalator at a much faster clip (but
he‘s still not running) He gets to the same security
checkpoint which is now of course completely packed

tries to push through cutting everyone ahead of hin

ANDY

At the checkpoint Andy tries to pass but he’s told to take
off his shoes He throws them on the belt and sprints to the
other side And then he waits

ANDY
Cc’mon c’mon

Andy extends his arms to grab his shoes as soon as they
appear from the rubber flaps His shoes poke out for a second
but then the belt goes back the other way

ANDY
Really That‘s how it’s gonna be

Back and forth they go on the belt a few more times Andys
frustration mounts He looks at the GERIATRIC HOMELAND
SECURITY AGENT who is studying the monitor

ANDY
Theyre just shoes

The Agent continues to look at the X-Ray Andy just sighs
shakes his head turns towards the gates

most likely I love you I do
But whatever Thats not important
What‘s important is that this

love shit is complicated It’s not
enough to just meet the right
person You gotta meet them at the
right time as well And we didn’t
And that’s not gonna change

(now Andy starts to tear)
But the thing is Braden meeting
the right person at the wrong time

never meeting them at all So Ive
come here more than anything
else just to say thank you
Thats it Thank you for
everything

(beat)
Youre the best mistake I ever
made

Braden laughs as she wipes away the tears They hug Andy
holds it an extra beat

BRADEN
