STOCK FOOTAGE OF COLD WAR EVENTS

Russian missiles Cuban missile crisis Vietnam Americans
in bomb drills An uneasy time

TITLE 1974
A History Channel-type NARRATOR begins

NARRATOR (VO)
The year was 1974 The United
States was locked in the cold war
always hungry for a new advantage
in the war against the Red Menace --
Communism It was an anxious
time A time when the United
States military went to
extraordinary lengths to protect
our country creating secret
weapons that now seem monstrous

INT PENTAGON PROVING GROUNDS

A CIA AGENT puts an array of cool James Bond-type devices
through their paces Gunfire Explosions Exciting spy
stuff Through the bulletproof window a few GENERALS and a
CIA scientist DR LEWIS watch It’s impressive

DR LEWIS
Well I didn’t call you here to
waste your time with this cloak-and-
dagger nonsense Are you ready to
see the future
They step into an elevator and after a few hundred feet
straight down
INT TOP SECRET LABORATORIES
Dr Lewis leads them on a tour
DR LEWIS
Gentlemen the cutting edge of
military research

They pass testing rooms where we see

- Psychics attempt to move a ball with their minds
- A CIA man rubs a communist flag with a sausage then shows
it to an attack dog

- A sign reads “Psycho-active Drugs” Below it lab
technicians observe as subjects feel each others faces in
ecstasy

The Generals raise eyebrows

TOP GENERAL
Are you kidding me

DR LEWIS
Granted not all of our work will
bear fruit

In the “Psychoactive drugs” room the lab techs have to
separate two subjects with a hose

DR LEWIS (CONTD)
But we can not afford to ignore any
areas of research even those on
the fringes of science The battle
for the American way of life is too
important

The Generals can’t argue with that

DR LEWIS (CONT’D)
Which leads us here We often talk
about that one weapon that might
tip the balance Inside this room
is that weapon Deployed properly
it could wreak more devastation
than the hydrogen bomb

The Generals look very interested We go inside

INT TOP SECRET BRIEFING ROOM
The Generals sit Dr Lewis works a slide projector
DR LEWIS
Gentlemen the most powerful weapon

we have ever designed

He clicks on the first slide -- an average-looking guy The
military guys react -- huh

TOP GENERAL
That’s it
DR LEWIS
Let me explain Our men in psy-ops
believe there is a tremendous
opportunity to exploit a high-
output social irritant This
irritant could be bred from birth
with no knowledge of his training
or mission -- a useful quality
should he ever be captured or
tortured The irritant could then
be introduced into a foreign
entity And if we pick our
target correctly

The next slide shows a universal human (like on a men’s room
sign) labeled “IRRITANT” being inserted into a “TARGET
ENTITY”

DR LEWIS (CONT’D)
He would have a crippling effect on
infrastructure and daily life

The next slide shows a pictographic flowchart Simple
diagrams show how the introduction of the irritant leads to
buildings on fire people killing each other -- complete
CHAOS The Generals look totally confused

TOP GENERAL
In layman’s terms doctor What
are we talking about here

DR LEWIS
We are talking about a man so
irritating he has the ability to
make any situation chaotic and self-
destructive A living time bomb so
annoying he makes an enemy lose the
capacity for rational thought We
are talking about the world’s
biggest asshole Hence

He clicks his final slide PROJECT A
A beat

TOP GENERAL
How soon can we have him
EXT ORPHANAGE PLAYGROUND

Kids at play JOHN an adorable 5-year old plays with a red
toy car John plays nicely with the other kids Hes a nice
little boy

DOWN THE BLOCK

Two CIA agents male and female watch John with binoculars

FEMALE AGENT
Target acquired

MALE AGENT
Let’s go
EXT ORPHANAGE PLAYGROUND
A kindly ADMINISTRATOR takes John by the hand
ADMINISTRATOR
John I want you to meet some
special people

John takes his car and follows

INT ORPHANAGE OFFICE

The administrator leads John in The CIA agents now dressed
as perfect parents greet him and gush over him

ADMINISTRATOR

John this is Mr and Mrs
MALE AGENT

Smith And aren’t you a special

boy

FEMALE AGENT
Didn’‘t I tell you he was perfect

EXT ORPHANAGE
The agents walk towards their car John follows -- but

lingers a beat The Administrator sees he’s scared He puts
a comforting arm around him
ADMINISTRATOR
Don’t worry John Mr and Mrs
Smith are very nice people who are
so excited to have a little boy of
their own Just be a good boy and
try to do what your new mommy and
daddy tell you and you’1ll be fine
okay

John nods

JOHN
I’1l be good

He walks to his new parents He turns back one last time --
but “Mrs Smith” sees his hesitation and with one deft move
tosses him in the back of a black Crown Victoria

He’s face to face with his OLDER BROTHER

MR SMITH
Youre a part of our family now
John I know it’s always hard for
an adopted child to adjust so I
just want you to know -- we’ll
never love you a much as your
brother but we’ll try

The brother slugs John gives him a dead-arm The parents
laugh indulgently

As John rubs his arm in surprise Mrs Smith grabs the toy
car out of his hands

JOHN
My car

MRS SMITH
It’s kind of gay

JOHN
(confused)
“Gay

She tosses it out the window

They pull away Out the back window John watches his little
red car get smaller and smaller and finally disappear

A single tear rolls down John’s face
INT KINDERGARTEN
John plays with the other kids Our narrator returns

NARRATOR (VO)
And so began the process of
creating the perfect asshole The
method was called “inverse
parenting” At every opportunity
John’s natural instincts were
subverted and re-directed Nature
had made him an impressionable
little boy Nurture would make him
the world’s biggest asshole

A kid walks over to John and takes John’s toy John upset
looks to the teacher

TEACHER
Sorry John That toy is his now

John considers He walks up to another kid -- then knocks
over the other kid and takes his toy The other kid tries to
grab it back

TEACHER (CONTD)
No -- that’s John’s now

John smiles He walks through the room knocking the other 5-
year-olds over and taking their stuff He looks back at his
teacher who smiles -- warm approving

We pull back to reveal The entire classroom is a controlled
CIA environment buried underground The room is filled with
two-way mirrors concealed cameras Behind the glass CIA
agents monitor the scene

NARRATOR (VO)
Over time the training had its
devastating effect The tabla rasa
became the tabla asshole-a

INT JOHNS FAMILY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

John has both hands in the cookie jar He shovels cookies
into his mouth His mom enters -- John quickly closes the
cookie jar and tries to look innocent His mom sees the
almost-empty jar
MRS SMITH
Huh I thought there were more
cookies in here What happened to
the cookies John

A beat His mind races

JOHN
(mouth full)
Billy ate them

He waits for his mom’s reaction Will she buy it She
smiles

MRS SMITH
Oh If Billy did it you’re not in
trouble In fact as a reward for
telling mommy about Billy

She hands him a cookie John gets an idea

JOHN
Billy also took the money out of
your purse

Mrs Smith smiles and hands him some money from her purse
She leaves John pumps his fist and helps himself to the
rest of her money

THROUGH A TWO-WAY MIRROR CIA agents watch approvingly and
scribble “deceit” on their clipboards

INT THIRD GRADE CLASS

Note throughout these school scenes all of the
environments are similarly CIA-controlled

John now eight stands at the head of the class “SHOW AND
TELL” is on the board John holds a very ordinary rock

JOHN
This is my favorite rock It’s
smooth on this side and shiny on
this side I found it at the
ocean

No one cares -- kids talk to each other The teacher does
paperwork John sadly takes his seat
INT JOHNS FAMILY’S HOUSE - THAT EVENING

John sits with his rock sad His mom enters

MRS SMITH
I heard you had a tough day at
school

JOHN

I don’t have any friends
She sits puts a comforting arm around him

MRS SMITH
It’s true You don’t You know
why

He shakes his head

MRS SMITH (CONTD)
You don’t have anything they want
Why would they waste their time

JOHN
What do they want

MRS SMITH
Oh honey There’s one thing
everyone wants

INT THIRD GRADE CLASS
Yet another show and tell

JOHN
This is money I’m rich Who
wants money

The kids cheer John gives them money They’re his friends
now -- they invite him to play with them tell him they like
him The teacher smiles at John John slips him a couple
bills

TEACHER
Wonderful A plus
INT FIFTH GRADE CLASS

John sits in the back -- he has to go to the bathroom
Badly He’s got his hand up his legs bounce but the
teacher just ignores him

He makes noises he waves his hand -- nothing Finally
after an agonizing wait -- John wets his pants Everyone
laughs at him

We see the same scenario happen again And again

INT JOHN’S FAMILY’S HOUSE

John’s mom puts his wet pants in the washing machine

JOHN
But why did they laugh at me
MRS SMITH
Because it was funny
JOHN
It was
MRS SMITH

You’re weak something bad happened
to you that’s what funny is

JOHN
Oh Why didn’t they help me

MRS SMITH
Because you see John Deep
down no one cares about you If
you want something you’d better
take it Because if you don’t the
world will screw you You’1ll spend
your whole life getting laughed at

INT FIFTH GRADE CLASS
John has to pee again It looks like he’s going to have

another accident when John realizes something He gets
up and walks out of class right past the teacher

OUTSIDE THE BOY’S BATHROOM
John walks out looking relieved John takes a step back

towards class but it’s a beautiful day He sees the fire
alarm

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY

The fire alarm RIIIIINGS Kids file out of the building
One of the smaller kids trips and falls down John looks at
the kid and forces out a single laugh Ha

The kid looks at John John forces more laughter Soon
other kids are laughing at the fallen kid along with John
John feels pretty good

The principal walks by

PRINCIPAL
Okay everyone single file let’s
go

He notices John standing suspiciously near the fire alarm

PRINCIPAL (CONTD)
John

JOHN
Billy did it

PRINCIPAL
Oh Good Thanks for the tip
Billy is in big trouble

He hands John a candy bar

INT JOHNS FAMILY’S HOUSE - DINNER

The family eats dinner John’s brother has an enormous pile
of chicken in front of him

JOHN
Can’t I just have one

MRS SMITH
Your brother likes chicken breasts

JOHN
He’s not gonna eat all of that

MRS SMITH
They’re his favorites And
favorites get favorites

John’s brother finishes eating Mom immediately swoops in
grabs the platter and dumps the remaining chicken in the
trash

INT FIFTH GRADE CLASS

“Life Skills” is written on the board A teacher in a
jumpsuit works with an assistant

LIFE SKILLS TEACHER
Let’s say one of your friends is
having a bad day and you want to
help him take a nap You just take
Mr Finger and poke him right in
Mr Jugular like so

The teacher demonstrates a vulcan-nerve-pinch technique on
the assistant The assistant drops

LIFE SKILLS TEACHER (CONTD)
Now Say your friend is being
really mean and you think he needs
a really really long nap

INT JOHN’S FAMILY’S HOUSE - JOHN’S BEDROOM
John’s dad sits with him on the bed

MR SMITH
John you’re growing up I know
you’ve been noticing changes in
your body and in girls’ bodies and
you’re probably curious about how
boys and girls are different You
see when girls become women
chemicals take over their brains
and make them crazy When that
happens they can’t think for
themselves anymore They get so
silly and confused they need a man
to tell them what to think

JOHN
Really

MR SMITH
Of course If you want to learn
more about women here are some
scientific pamphlets

He hands John a stack of pornography

MR SMITH (CONTD)
That’s everything you need to know
about women right there

INT CLASSROOM

A social studies class “WORLD CULTURES” is on the board
John stands at the front of the room giving a report

JOHN
In conclusion As you can see
there are many different cultures
around the world and they are all
worse than ours If you are ever
in one of these countries be sure
to point out what is wrong with
them Because it’s the only way
they’1ll get better

The teacher leads the class in applause

TEACHER

MR SMITH

A poem For a girl Why

JOHN

MRS SMITH
Then you’re going about it all
wrong son Girls don’t like
poems They’re not smart enough to
understand them

MR SMITH
If you like a girl you need to
spell it out for them Say
something like “got any Irish in
you Want some” Or “Nice tits”

MRS SMITH
“Nice tits” That’s the line that
made me fall in love with your

father

INT HIGH SCHOOL LUNCH ROOM

drivers license

NARRATOR (VO)

It had been many years John’s
creators were eager to see if their
weapon was ready for action

INT LAWYER’S OFFICE
John and his brother sit with the LAWYER

LAWYER

Very sorry for your loss Now
there was a will

(reads )
To Steve our golden golden boy
we leave everything Fly Golden

EXT LAWYERS OFFICE

John and his brother walk out The brother has his arms full
of money

BROTHER

JOHN
But I’m their son too

BROTHER
Yeah kind of I guess

The brother walks to a sports car and struggles to stuff the
money in the car He takes off John has a COMPLETE FURIOUS
MELTDOWN

JOHN
Damnit Damnit

John notices a STREET MUSICIAN playing a guitar John grabs
the guitar and smashes it to pieces He starts to laugh

STREET MUSICIAN
What’s funny about that

JOHN
I smashed your guitar You’re
probably poor and stuff

STREET MUSICIAN
That’s not funny

John grabs the guy’s collection bowl and takes the money

JOHN
You like that Is that funny

Across the street in a car -- Dr Lewis who started it all
watches with an assistant

DR LEWIS
Look at that anger That
sociopathic disregard for the
welfare of others

BACK ON JOHN People start to gather

CONCERNED GUY
Hey what’s the deal Did you just
smash that guy’s guitar

JOHN
Me No it was that retarded guy

John points at an innocent bystander The Concerned guy
turns his attention to him

retarded guy

CONCERNED GUY

The three guys start to fight John smiles and watches --
he’s in a better mood now

BACK WITH DR LEWIS Who watches as more people get drawn
into the melee

DR LEWIS
When Oppenheimer first tested the
atomic bomb he didn’t know if the
reaction could be contained or if
he would set the world on fire I
know how he must have felt

He admires John for a beat then

DR LEWIS (CONTD)
He’s ready

NARRATOR (VO)
John had become a powerful living
weapon capable of unleashing
havoc And so the CIA sent him out
into the world careful to place
him in an environment where an
asshole of his magnitude would not
be too conspicuous

EXT NEW YORK CITY

TITLE New York City Present Day

A city filled with assholes We move from asshole to
asshole looking for John Then we find him
STREET CORNER

A BLIND MAN attempts to cross the street

The coast is clear The blind guy takes a step but then a
CAR NOISE makes him jump back to the curb

Reveal -- John the source of the noise laughing himself
stupid The blind guy tries again John makes another noise
laughs and heads happily to work

NARRATOR (VO)
Keeping John battle-ready proved to
be a challenge He required an
environment which would allow him
to stay in top condition but where
few would question the presence of
a military-grade asshole

EXT TECH SUPPORT CENTER - ESTABLISHING

INT TECH SUPPORT CENTER - JOHN’S CUBICLE
John’s on the phone

She worms out of it and hurries away
JOHN (CONTD)
I’m not giving up on you I’1l
never give up on you

INT BOSS’ OFFICE

The BOSS calms a bunch of pissed-off-looking employees

BOSS

The boss doles out cash He gives a double share to the

JOHN

the truth It never goes out of

(for benefit of zaftig
woman )
And you never get too fat to fit
into it

Rick walks away John can’t believe it

JOHN (CONTD)
All of a sudden the truth is bad
I’m just trying to help you

John turns to the remaining co-workers

JOHN (CONTD)
Can you believe that guy I’m the
one who should be mad I mean can
you believe I’m still stuck here in

The party stops cold as John rants

JOHN (CONTD)
This go-nowhere hell is fine for
you people I mean none of you

ME I’ve got a destiny And it
ain’t this

In the BG someone grabs the cake knife and takes a step
towards John The boss quietly taps the guy on the neck --
the guy drops John done ranting storms out in disgust

INT BAR - THAT EVENING

John enters and once inside feels better-- Cock of the walk

into his earpiece
JB

JB (CONTD)

JOHN
When has The Stallion ever gone
home empty-handed
John squeezes his hands in a sleazy grope-y move They
laugh

Never
They exchange an annoying frat-boy soul handshake
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAR

A CIA agent talks to a woman -- her body language is
unmistakable -- she’s trying to back out of something

AGENT
Look we went over this 1000 times
That was the deal You -- ahem --
show him a good time And we count
the last seven years of your
sentence as time served And maybe
there’s some money waiting in your
savings account when you get out

She thinks Looks at John A long pained beat as she
watches him ogle women scratch himself

AGENT (CONTD)
This is a chance at a new life

And she grabs a very large drink and downs it
BACK WITH JOHN
The ex-con woman walks up

JOHN
Well hello

John looks her up and down not bothering to be subtle

JOHN (CONTD)
Nice dress It would look great on
my floor

He waits for the line to work its magic She sighs Downs
the rest of John’s drink

WOMAN
Let’s go

John smiles He turns to the bartender and pantomimes
blowing on two smoking “finger-guns” and holstering them

They leave Bartender immediately into earpiece

JB
Package en route

INT JOHNS APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

John’s place is decorated in the “posters of hot girls lying
on cars” school To the bed Where John looks very pleased
with himself The woman looks stricken

JOHN
Damn I was good

The woman suppresses a dry heave

JOHN (CONTD)
Oh a lot of woman get that with
me It’s the body’s natural
reaction to too much pleasure
Anyway got a little parting gift
for you m’lady

John gets out of bed On the floor are twelve identical gift
baskets They all have cards that say “To a special lady”
He grabs one at random and hands it to her

JOHN (CONTD)
It’s expensive but I think you’re
worth it

He hands her the basket

JOHN (CONTD)
Anyway you should probably take
off Because you know I’m done
and it’s weird when women stick
around in the morning

EXT JOHN’S APARTMENT

The woman gets into a waiting CIA car

AGENT
So how does it feel to get your
life back

WOMAN

The memories of this unspeakable
night will haunt my dreams forever

INT CIA CONFERENCE ROOM

These guys all look like serious no-nonsense guys But one
in particular is a Dick Cheney among Dick Cheneys -- GENERAL
SCHILLER Dr Lewis older now looks over reports on
Project A -- John’s file

DR LEWIS
We had high hopes for Project A
but it looks like another cold war
dinosaur It’s getting too tough
to contain him We’re pouring in
millions Id rather put somewhere
else Shut it down

Everyone mumbles agreement

GENERAL SCHILLER
I’ll take care of it

INT BLACK OPS SECRET BUNKER

A motley crew of the baddest badasses These are the BLACK
OPS guys you hear about -- they work on the fringe of the
government and the law and they look scarier than the CIA

Schiller enters The room comes to order as he walks to a
map He points to a tiny country nestled in Eastern Europe

GENERAL SCHILLER
To review Hazbakistan has been
reliably unstable for years
Giving the US a reliable excuse
to maintain a military presence in
the region But there is talk of a
peace treaty

Angry murmurs about the peace treaty
GENERAL SCHILLER (CONT’D)
If that happens the President will
withdraw and a democratically
elected government will follow
The dominoes begin to fall Peace
will spread like a cancer through
the region And that is very bad
for us The peace treaty must be
stopped

MAN IN EYEPATCH
Of course That is nothing new

GENERAL SCHILLER
We must create a situation where
the US is compelled to supply a
military presence For example if
the US Ambassador were to be
assassinated In the ensuing
chaos a civil war would follow
The President would be forced to
send in the troops to preserve
peace The President with world
opinion on his side would be
forced to abandon talk of
democratic elections

BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES
We’ve been through these scenarios
There’s no way to do it without
leaving our fingerprints on it

GENERAL SCHILLER
Ah But there’s been a
development There is a way for us
to get our assassination

The group reacts -- good news

GENERAL SCHILLER (CONTD)
The locals will rise up of and kill
our ambassador And they will do
it of their own accord They will
never know that they are in
effect working for us

The group reacts -- this is bold maybe impossible

BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES
But how The ambassador is a
saint Who would kill him People
will smell a rat

GENERAL SCHILLER
Well then-- he’s the wrong
ambassador isn’t he

Everyone looks at each other -- what does that mean

GENERAL SCHILLER (CONT’D)
What if the ambassador were a
different sort of man A man so
ill-suited to diplomacy he could
get Ghandi to kill him

Schiller smiles

GENERAL SCHILLER (CONTD)
Gentlemen we have that man

INT JOHN’S CUBICLE
John is at his desk on the phone

JOHN
(in perky “computer”
voice)
For English press one For
English press one No you go to

understand that Good-bye

JOHN’S BOSS
There’s a gentleman here to see
you John Conference room

INT CONFERENCE ROOM

John enters General Schiller greets him with a big
handshake

GENERAL SCHILLER
Had enough of tech support John

JOHN
Who are you How do you know my
name

GENERAL SCHILLER
My name is Bob Jones and I know a
lot about you The government has
been watching you and we’re very
impressed
That hits

JOHN
Watching me That’s gay

GENERAL SCHILLER
We have an offer for you

JOHN
What kind of offer

GENERAL SCHILLER
The kind that would help you to
finally reach your potential

home

JOHN
Reach my potential As in no
more tech support As in

GENERAL SCHILLER
Your destiny

John can’t believe it

GENERAL SCHILLER (CONTD)
We think you’re meant for something
a lot bigger than this

JOHN

That’s what I’ve been telling
everyone You can not believe the
jealousy

GENERAL SCHILLER
I bet But we understand how
special you are It’s a crime the
way you’ve been wasting your life
here Doing what these people do
Doing what a woman does

John is nodding along - sold

GENERAL SCHILLER (CONTD)
And to correct that injustice and
in recognition of your excellence
at tech support I would like
to offer you a very important
government job where a man like you
can make a difference in the world

JOHN
A chance to show everyone what I
can do A mission

GENERAL SCHILLER
Exactly

JOHN
I’1l be good

GENERAL SCHILLER
We have no doubt

INT TECH SUPPORT

They walk through the office John triumphantly makes his
good-byes

recognize from the shadows of Schiller’s secret bunker --
BLACK OPS AGENTS

BLACK OPS AGENT
Did you enjoy being the ambassador
Make a lot of good memories

BODNER
What are you talking about

off their calm spooky smiles--

BODNER (CONTD)
Are you going to kill me

BLACK OPS AGENT
No no no That would make you a
martyr

(MORE )

we

BLACK OPS AGENT (CONTD)
No we were thinking you might
retire so that no one finds out
about how your wife paid to smuggle
her family into the United States

BODNER
I don’t know what you’re talking
about

2ND BLACK OPS AGENT
Then you should see these pictures

They toss him a pile of photos We see just enough to know
it’s of a woman in compromising positions

BODNER
Getting her family out was a matter
of life and death it was long

before I met her

BLACK OPS AGENT
I know If you ask me she’s a
hero

2ND BLACK OPS AGENT
(re pictures)
Anyone who can do that sure is

The two agents laugh

But not everyone is as open-minded
as we are

They share a creepy belly laugh

What can I say Sometimes life
throws us a curve ball One day
Ambassador Bodner is one of the
most beloved members of the

tendering his resignation

Not a good time for this
Country’s taking its first steps to
independence Need the right man
for this job

got him A rising star John
Smith

Schiller presents the President with a cooked-up file on

LINDA BURNS an attractive serious ivy leaguer with ten
years in the diplomatic corps welcomes John

LINDA
Ambassador Smith I’m Linda Burns
your deputy chief of mission

John gives her his signature handshake which as usual turns
into a grope She looks alarmed but not quite sure what’s
going on -- surely this couldn’t be happening in broad
daylight She waits for it to stop but it goes on for quite
a while

JOHN
Yeah nice to meet you

She gives him the benefit of the doubt -- tries to be
professional Finally she wriggles out of it

LINDA
So um welcome
John gives her a slow once over Up down Up down
JOHN

Nice So you’re like my secretary

LINDA
No I’m deputy chief of mission
More like your right hand

JOHN
My right hand Then I know what
youll be doing a lot of

Nothing

LINDA
Um what is that

JOHN
My right hand

LINDA
I don’t understand

JOHN
The thing my right hand does

Long awkward pause

JOHN (CONTD)
Oh right That’s my left hand

LINDA
So let’s get you briefed Theres
a lot to talk about

INT CONFERENCE ROOM

There are various charts maps displays all relating to
Hazbakistan and the situation Linda organizes her
presentation John uses the light from the Power Point
projector to look down her shirt She realizes what he’s
doing and laughs nervously trying to convince herself it was
an accident or a joke She begins

LINDA
Hazbakistan is going through a
period of historic transformation
(MORE )
LINDA (CONTD)
For the first time the warring
factions have laid down their arms
Peace has come to the region

JOHN
Want to bring your piece to MY
region

LINDA

Um I’m not sure I understand what
that means

JOHN
I’m going through a historic
transformation in my pants

LINDA
Okay got it If I may

JOHN
Look I’ve spent a lot of years in
an office environment and one
thing I’ve learned is there’s no
better way to keep things running
smoothly than for co-workers to
have sex That’s a proven fact
You see it releases endorphins
But we can get back to that Keep
going You were saying something
about cooking or cleaning or your
feelings or something

LINDA
Uh as I was saying the factions
are getting along for the first
time Here are the ones you should
know as they will all be players
in the new government The King
of course His Royal Highness Alon
Codru the Third

We see a picture of King Alon

LINDA (CONTD)
King Alon has never gotten along
well with Chief Bessar who leads
the warlords in the badlands of
outer Hazbakistan

We see a picture of Chief Bessar a tough leathery guy
holding a rocket launcher He looks like many pictures
youve seen of anti-soviet Afghans

LINDA (CONTD)
And of course General Adnab chief
commander of the military whose

loyalties have shifted
political climate

with the

A shot of a General looking Saddam-like

LINDA (CONTD)
We’‘ve been working closely with
Prime Minister Obasz who is
something of a figurehead but will
most likely take on a leadership
role in the new government

We see PM Obasz a veteran politi

cian

LINDA (CONTD)

What is truly astounding is that

all of these parties have finally
put their differences aside Of

course it’s not going
to maintain this peace

to be easy
It will

take a great deal of ego-stroking

to keep everyone happy

JOHN
Stroking

LINDA
Yes

JOHN
Stroking

LINDA
Yes

John pushes a pen off the table
Linda

JOHN
Oops

She just stands there

Lets it roll in front of

JOHN (CONTD)
Would you mind My back

Linda bends over to pick it up
obviously

John gawks fairly
JOHN (CONTD)
Very nice

LINDA
Sir I’m sorry but I am talking
about life-and-death issues here
I am going to put aside what is
obviously gross sexual harassment
because you need to get to know
these people well and you need to
make sure they all feel valued or
this treaty will not stand This
job is about give and take
respect sensitivity

John looks horrified Something dawns on him
JOHN
Wait a second Are you saying
they want me to act like a pussy

assignment and I need to brief you

JOHN
Oh really You want to get into my
briefs

LINDA

I didn’t say anything that
remotely sounded like that
(MORE )

LINDA (CONTD)
Now can we get back to work You
need to take this seriously

JOHN
I am taking this seriously Do you
think we should look like pussies
to these people Is that good for

America
LINDA

I no of course not But--
JOHN

That’s right That’s why I’m the
ambassador and you’re my secretary

LINDA
I’m not--

JOHN
Listen to me When I saw you were
a woman I knew we were starting
with a handicap

LINDA
A handicap What are you saying

JOHN
Right woman forgot A handicap
is like something that makes it
harder for us to do a good job
Like a guy with no arms or severe
gayness or in your case being a
woman We’re just gonna have to
work that much harder But don’t
you worry We’re gonna show
everyone that a woman and a guy
from tech support can do an amazing
job

LINDA
You came from tech support

JOHN
And I am not going back there
I’ve spent enough of my life
getting pushed around being told I
wasn’t good enough It’s John’s
time now And John is going to
show everyone that he can
ambassador the ass out of this
Are you with me Are you ready to
fix that bass-ackwards little
country

She sighs Her duty comes before her personal feelings

LINDA
Are there any other questions I can
answer

JOHN

Yeah you know how a lot of
Mexicans are maids

LINDA
I don’t see how that’s I mean --
while there are certain demographic
clusters of certain er

PRIME MINISTER OBASZ
Don’t worry Ms Deputy Chief New

JOHN
Especially when the new one is
worse Hey it’s not their fault

used to it Sometimes it takes an
outsider to explain to people how
bad they smell And I’m proud to
be that guy

Just keepin’ it real here They
deserve the truth Don’t you think
they deserve the truth I do

PRIME MINISTER OBASZ

Yes

I think what Ambassador Smith is
saying is let’s focus on the one
million dollars in cultural aid the
united states is going to allocate

for the national museum

PRIME MINISTER OBASZ
Of course Well We hope you will
enjoy this residence Some of the
more important architectural

features I can point out--

share resources with the

attractive country and I bring her
back here and no TV How is she
going to respect me then How is
anyone going to respect a man
without a TV And if they don’t
respect me how do I clean up your
mess

Yes I’m sorry you’re
disappointed

No It’s my fault for expecting
you to be good at your job what
with your ethnic background But

themselves into your brain

Yes

LINDA
Well we can’t let them do this
We need you back

I don’t see how These are

been feuding for centuries Blood
has been spilled You can’t just
stick a man next to the man who
tried to kill his son and expect
them to get along

Let me just drop a little Dr Phil
on you “Get over it”

at a mall

JOHN
They do now The 500 dollars you
guys had for every citizen to go to
high school Gift Certificates
And I rolled all that retirement
BS -- which no one lives long
enough to collect -- into coupons
for makeovers at the day spa

LINDA
Youre kidding

JOHN
What I’m doing is thinking outside
the box okay

LINDA
Please tell me it’s not all gone

What’s going on We follow the pipes through the streets
past a group of protestors in a candlelight vigil up to

EXT JOHN’S MANSION - BALCONY

Where John’s new hot tub is full of water He keeps sloshing
around the water is running over the side -- no matter
fresh water keeps pouring in As always -- The air
conditioners are on lights on music on Linda stands next
to the tub looking uncomfortable

John addresses his camera crew

JOHN
After a long day saving the world
nothing beats a hot tub

LINDA
You do understand that by living
like this you are only making these
people resent you

JOHN
I think you’re a little naive about
how the world works Come on get
in

LINDA
No I’m only here because I want
to discuss how we can avoid a
disaster--

JOHN
You don’t even need a suit I’m
not wearing one C’mon These

Another paramilitary meeting It’s more crowded than the
previous ones A knock at the door They open it and a

They close the door -- but there’s already a new person
trying to get in Reveal several people we recognize from

has benefited from a recent makeover

much that can be done with slogans

Linda is surrounded by John’s files

In the background John’s show is on TV We see John
asking Linda to get in

Did I give my secretary a little
extra work You be the judge

Close on Linda’s face then -- quick cut to a much longer
shot of a near-naked woman getting into the hot tub A
clumsy attempt to make it look like it was Linda She reacts
-- disgusted -- she quickly turns off the TV

She goes back to her investigation

We see her notes -- next to each “previous employer” or
“contact” on John’s resume are notes like “no record” or
“possible CIA”

She now turns her attention to her internet screen where a
recent picture of John’s parents appears They’re very much
alive and doing dinner theatre She looks from the picture
to John’s file where his parents are clearly marked
“DECEASED” She dials the phone

INT WASHINGTON DC OFFICE

Bodner sits in his office looking depressed Drinking even
more He looks at a picture of his wife and winces

He answers his phone -- it’s Linda

BODNER
This isn’t a secure line

LINDA
Understood I have a message
concerning the package The
package was made by the company
I’m sure of it

BODNER
Youre sure

LINDA
Positive

BODNER
Then these are dangerous people
you’re messing with

LINDA
And all the more reason why the
package must not reach its
destination

He nods -- of course she’s right

LINDA (CONTD)
You must know someone who can get a
look at the package’s file

BODNER
(suddenly explodes)
Maybe I should send my wife
(then)
Sorry No of course I’m oon it

INT LINCOLN MEMORIAL

Bodner talks to a CIA agent who we recognize as JB the
bartender

BODNER
You personally saw them train this
man John Smith

JB
Oh no His security clearance was
wayyyy above me But I heard some
things They trained him ina
special environment Some of the
psy-ops people were in on it
Here’s all I could get from his
file

The agent coughs up a piece of paper that he takes out of a
baggie and unrolls It’s the title page of a file “PROJECT
A - SOCIAL IRR” and the rest is cut off

JB (CONTD)
Just the front page All I could
get

BODNER
So he’s CIA

JB
That’s the weird thing CIA says
he was terminated

Bodner processes this

BODNER
Thank you You may have saved many
lives

working for What are you up to

JOHN
Shh shh take it easy it’s OK

He gives her an open-robe hug She pushes him away

LINDA
I know you’re CIA I don’t know
what you’re doing but there’s only
two options -- you’re either an
operative or a patsy

JOHN
Babe I don’t know what you’re
talking about But women who think
as much as you do tend to wrinkle

I thought some of the people in
your file looked familiar Turns
out I was right -- only they all
used to have different names back
when they were field operatives

promoted from Tech Support to

brief you on what is about to
become a financial crisis We have

Everything that was supposed to
rebuild this country You spent it

John takes this in very seriously He taps his head

What do you think of that new
“thinking noise” It’s so you
think I’m considering your idea

John looks at her -- his eyes full of wonder He thinks it
through Is she crazy Or a genius

LINDA (CONTD)
Don’t you see Putting air in your
spare tire It’s like helping the
homeless Sure you don’t get
anything out of it But don’t you
feel better knowing your tire is
better off And when you wash
under the bumper in that spot that
no one sees but you doesn’t that
feel good

He nods He knows that feeling

EXT SMALL TOWN - A FEW WEEKS LATER

LINDA
That’s right

He puts a lascivious arm on her--

JOHN

You know what else would feel good
LINDA

John
JOHN

I’m sorry Groping you would uh
NOT feel better than giving money

to steal it and spend it on booze
Which is just an assumption

quo

LINDA
It looks delicious

She hands him the bag

JOHN
What’s this

LINDA
I called in some favors from some
of my old diplomatic connections

JOHN
It wasn’t sexual favors because
not all women are prostitutes
Because
(thinks )
not all women are glorified
whores

LINDA
Thanks John very good So what I
have here is everything you need
to start a new life with a new
identity

John looks at the stuff -- passport money He’s

LINDA
He made you ambassador because he
wanted you to fail

JOHN
Why would you choose me if you
wanted to fail I’m John baby
I’m

He realizes

JOHN (CONTD)
An asshole

LINDA

LINDA
You can’t just get rid of it

JOHN

LINDA
You have to right your wrongs

JOHN
Of course I can’t just run away

poor people who only seem retarded
because they grew up in that
crappy uh different country with
it’s um special smells

LINDA
That’s right And I’m proud of you
for realizing that But there’s no
way you can take them on

JOHN
Yes I can I ruined the country
Why can’t I fix it

LINDA
How

JOHN
I‘1l use what you taught me Being
nice Which is just another way of
saying “statesmanship” Isn’t that
what a real ambassador would do

LINDA
I suppose--

JOHN
Then I’m going back there and I’m
going to do it I don’t know how
but I’m going to save that retarded
country

LINDA
But there’s a hit out on you
Probably several It’s suicide

JOHN
I don’t care I owe it to them

Beat

LINDA
Then I’m going with you

They hug John’s hand wanders up but in an incredible test
of will he keeps the embrace chaste Will he be able to keep
it clean He battles his own hands as if they have minds of
their own After an eternity of fighting his urges-- She
breaks away He looks incredibly relieved
She looks at him
