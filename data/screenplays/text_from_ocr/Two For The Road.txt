TEASER
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT 1
WE SMASH RIGHT BACK IN ON -- MICHAEL

In the flesh and looking like death warmed over He lies
unconscious on the JUNGLE FLOOR as a concerned KATE
illuminates his battered and scraggly face with a TORCH --

KATE
Michael Michael

No response -- his eyes stay closed his condition worsening
by the second Kate looks to JACK

KATE (CONTD)
What’s wrong with him

But Jack’s attention is on the TREELINE His mind’s been
racing since the moment Michael appeared FULLY AMPED He
SCANS for signs of movement Reaches for his GUN -- not
about to be satisfied until he gets what he came here for --
QUALITY FACE TIME WITH THE OTHERS

Kate’s totally focused on Michael --

KATE (CONTD)
Jack

But Jack’s still looking out at the jungle --

JACK
Maybe they let him go

KATE
Let him go -- he’s alone

JACK
We don’t know that

KATE
I know he’s sick -- and I know he’s
been gone two weeks -- stop looking
for (fucking) them

Jack turns looks at her Kate’s still pissed but she’s
focused on Michael’s UNCONSCIOUS FORM as --

( )
1

KATE (CONTD)
They didn’t just push him out of
the jungle Jack --

And as much as Jack’d like to get down to business with the
Others right now as much as he hates being turned around
again HE KNOWS KATE’S RIGHT

KATE (CONTD)
-- He’s alone

Jack holsters his gun walks back over to them

Kate scuffles aside as Jack leans over Michael checks his
pulse -- his BREATH A beat then --

JACK
C’mon let’s go

And YEAH -- we did detect a hint of DEFEAT in Jack’s voice
there But he’s already throwing Michael over his shoulder
in a firemans carry and WALKING OFF

And OFF KATE as after a beat she FOLLOWS --

hands tied together in front of him feet bound staring
blankly at the wall This is a man who has clearly GIVEN UP
A bowl of NOW OLD FRUIT sits a few feet from him

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)

How long you gonna keep up the
hunger strike man

A SILENT BEAT NOTHING FROM HENRY Not even a FLICKER from
his eyes Ana Lucia decides to do the talking --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)

I ever tell you I was a cop

(no response)
Y’know I’ve been around a lot of
killers

(Henry remains silent)
And you know what surprises me
about ‘em How much they like to
talk

Ana Lucia goes to take the bowl of old fruit replacing it
with the fresh mangoes --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
(looks at him)
But I guess you’re different huh
Henry Quiet
(beat)
Well don’t tell anyone but that’s
just the way I like you

And then -- Henry MUMBLES something It’s barely audible
but it’s the first sound he’s made in days Ana stops with
the fruit Looks at him --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
What was that

Henry MUMBLES again Ana Lucia LEANS IN closer --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
If you’re gonna say something
you’re gonna have to --

And before she can fucking process anything Henrys SWINGS
HIS TIED HANDS UP AND SMASHES THE PORCELAIN FOOD BOWL RIGHT
INTO THE SIDE OF HER FUCKING HEAD

SMAAASSSHHH CRAAACCKK Porcelain pieces shatter and halo
off her HAIRLINE

Ana Lucia falls back stunned Henry’s eyes are fierce as he
seizes the moment and lunges toward her GRABBING her NECK
between his bare hands --

That’s right HE’S GONNA STRANGLE HER HIS HISSES INTENSE -- 3
HENRY
You make me sick
Ana’s eyes go WIDE -- she tries to fight back but she’s
dazed from the blow and lack of oxygen -- Henry knows he’s

got the advantage And despite what he’s doing he is ODDLY
CALM And that Is fucking DISTURBING --

HENRY (CONTD)
You killed two of us Good people
who were leaving you alone and you
murdered them

Ana Lucia knows this is going bad She gathers her remaining
strength and KNEES HENRY right in the GROIN And you know
what It doesn’t stop him for a second His grip TIGHTENS
on her NECK and he SLAMS HER UP AGAINST THE WALL

And as her head BANGS against the CONCRETE it hits her all at
once she’s going to fucking DIE here --

HENRY (CONTD)
You’re the killer Ana Lucia
You’re the killer

Ana Lucia teeters on the brink of consciousness her body
beginning to go limp when --

THWACK Henry collapses in a heap AS HE FALLS WE --
RACK FOCUS AND FIND -- LOCKE

Holding the CRUTCH he used to SMASH HENRY OVER THE HEAD He
looks to Ana Lucia GASPING FOR AIR --

smile to cover --

SCHTHUNK A STEEL METAL HANDLE SLAMS DOWN -- A SHINY
STAINLESS STEEL DOOR IS PULLED OPEN and A METAL SLAB IS

PULLED OUT OF THE DRAWER On it --

A SHEET COVERING WHAT IS CLEARLY A DEAD BODY Yeah We’re
in a fucking MORGUE

Cortez stands over the body Ana Lucia right next to her
Intentionally AVERTS her eyes as Cortez pulls back the sheet

The DEAD GUY is a young white man His CHEST is riddled
with GUNSHOT WOUNDS If you’re a loyal viewer you recognize
this guy as JASON -- the man Ana Lucia shot in “Collision”
If you’re NOT Cortez is about to explain it to you

CORTEZ
Found him in a parking lot just
after three in the morning He was
dead an hour before anyone saw him

ON ANA LUCIA She blinks Maybe a shred of GUILT

CORTEZ (CONTD)
Crime scene pulled the gun from a
dumpster Registration filed off
No prints No witnesses
(beat)
He was executed

Ana finally looks up to see her mother looking right at her
And it’s with a completely STRAIGHT FACE that she says --

ANA LUCIA
Any idea who did it

A beat Another beat Cortez’s eyes UNBLINKING Finally --

CORTEZ
Yeah Ana You did it

A TENSE BEAT as Ana Lucia’s eyes fill with emotion

Ana Lucia opens her mouth to protest but before she can --

CORTEZ (CONTD)
This man -- he confesses to
shooting you in cold blood But
you You refuse to ID him So we
have to cut him loose

(pointed)

And a week later he turns up with
five bullets in his chest because
somebody shot him In cold blood

And that IS guilt on Ana Lucia’s face And her eyes are
starting to water But she fucking CHOKES it down --

ANA LUCIA
Guess I better get a lawyer

And Ana turns to go but --

Cortez grabs her by the wrist PULLS her around And we can

see that there is MUCH more than anger here -- this is a
mother who is DEEPLY FUCKING WORRIED about her daughter

CORTEZ
Look you and I both know this is a
dead end investigation
(beat emotional)
But if you If you did this I
have to help you Ana I just --

ANA LUCIA

(pulls away then)
But I’m fine

But Cortez isn’t giving up Really REACHING OUT here --

CORTEZ
You won’t let me help you Then
you’re gonna need to get it from
somewhere else
(beat measured)
You’re a police officer Ana If
you don’t respect me respect that

see that part of her WANTS to ask for help WANTS to

We can

collapse into her mother’s arms and apologize WANTS to tell

her what this man -- what this FUCKER -- really did to her

But Ana She can’t do any of that So without a word she
removes her BADGE UNHOLSTERS her gun And hands them both
to her mother

ANA LUCIA
I quit

AND OFF ANA LUCIA as she throws open the door and begins what
will be a LONG WALK away from everything she’s ever known --

INT HATCH - BATHROOM - DAY 6

hair back to reveal the BLOODY WOUND RIGHT ABOVE HER EAR

LOCKE’S REFLECTION appears in the mirror Ana Lucia
continues to clean her wound PISSED OFF AT HERSELF

defense

ANA LUCIA

night to take our kids

(beat)
I hit her with a rock

Listening as Ana continues --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
The second one was pretending to be
one of us Said his name was
Goodwin I jammed a spear through
his chest

Okay Not exactly self-defense We eagerly await

Locke’s thoughts on all this But all he does is point to

the GASH

on Ana’s forehead --

it over her shoulder Manages to bring him to a SITTING
POSITION Jack looks at her understands the gesture --

LIBBY (0S)
What happened

WIDEN TO REVEAL Ana Lucia’s got a needle and thread and is
about to sew up her own fucking head using a propped up
COMPACT MIRROR

ANA LUCIA
Cut myself shaving

LIBBY
Stop that Let me

Ana Lucia looks up -- HARDCORE Part of her WANTS to go
through the suffering of stitching herself but after a beat
she hands the needle to Libby

A beat as Libby sits across from her studies the GASH Ana
can feel her eyes on her waiting for an explanation

ANA LUCIA
Guy in the hatch tried to kill me

LIBBY

You okay
ANA LUCIA

Yeah I’m fine

Libby clocks her -- she’s not fine she’s fucking ANGRY

LIBBY

Ana
ANA LUCIA

LIBBY

Ana says nothing -- but their eyes meet hold a beat Libby
shakes her head then LEANS IN --

LIBBY (CONTD)
Okay This is gonna hurt

And OFF ANA GRITTING HER TEETH before the needle PUNCHES IN

INT HATCH - LIVING AREA - DAY 10

Locke leans on his crutches as he stands in the ENTRYWAY to
the living area Reaches his fingers as high as they’1ll go
to touch the TEETH of the BLAST DOOR that resides in the wall
above him The blast door with the fucking MAP on it

A BEAT Another BEAT And Locke finally turns towards the
ARMORY DOOR PUSHING IN And although Henry’s a liar
someone who just tried to KILL one of our castaways

He’s John Locke’s only fucking shot at ANSWERS

INT HATCH - ARMORY - DAY 11

TOTAL DARKNESS as THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN casting a SHAFT OF
LIGHT on Henry sitting on the COT

Henry is not only bound by his wrists but he is also
TETHERED to the bed And fucking TIGHTLY too

ON LOCKE Backlit Very fucking NOIR Just looking at
Henry Trying to make sense of him The silent moment
PLAYS Then --

HENRY
If you’ve come to apologize I
forgive you for hitting me with
your crutch
(beat)
I’m glad my head didn’t break it

Boy is he fucking smug And Locke ain’t one bit amused --

LOCKE
Why

HENRY
Now there’s a broad question

LOCKE
Why did you try to hurt Ana Lucia
and not me

ON HENRY His eyes dance with intelligence But -—-
HENRY

I’m not sure I know what you’re
getting at John

LOCKE
I was trapped under that blast
door Helpless You could’ve
crushed my skull And you didn’t
doa thing Why didn’t --

HENRY
Because you’re one of the good
ones John

LOCKE
Good whats

HENRY
(shakes his head)
None of it matters I’m dead

anyway

Locke listens with deep skepticism

HENRY (CONTD)
The doctor went out to make a
trade and you and I both know
he’1ll come back empty-handed And
then
(simple cold)
I have lost my value

Locke’s mind spins with the implications And Henry is
ROLLING now --

ON LOCKE

HENRY (CONTD)
So either Jack comes back and kills
me or my people find where I’m
being held and they do it

LOCKE
Why would your own people --
HENRY
Because the man in charge He’s a
great man John -- a brilliant man

(a flash of FEAR)
But he is not a forgiving man

Forgetting why he even fucking came in here

Totally caught up in Henry’s download

HENRY (CONTD)
They’1l kill me because I failed
John I failed my mission

11 11
LOCKE
What “mission”
HENRY
When that woman caught me in her
trap I was on my way here John

SUDDENLY A COMMOTION CAN BE HEARD FROM THE HALLWAY -- MUFFLED
VOICES -- SEVERAL PEOPLE ENTERING THE HATCH -- KATE’S VOICE --

KATE (0S)
JOHN

Locke looks towards Kate’s VOICE but quickly turns back to
Henry And we are SUPER TIGHT on him as he softly says --

HENRY
I was on my way here John because
I was coming for you

HOLY FUCKING SHIT NOW JACK’S VOICE --

JACK (0S)
LOCKE Get out here

ON HENRY Laid bare Not a shred of the Lecter bullshit --
he’s as GENUINE as we’ve ever seen him

ON LOCKE Head SPINNING Doesn’t know whether he’s being
fucked with or he’s just been given the meaning of LIFE

JACK (0S) (CONTD)
JOHN I NEED YOU

And as Locke turns to see Jack and Kate hauling MICHAEL into
the living area he SNAPS OUT OF IT

And with one last look at Henry -- DESPERATE Henry -- Locke
SLIDES the door SHUT -- snuffing out that single stream of
light and plunging us into --

BLACK

MAN (0S)
Nice to see you again

And Ana Lucia turns to see

CHRISTIAN SHEPHARD

Yup Jack’s Dad Dr Fucking Shephard Here he is in the
flesh smiling at Ana Lucia and draining a SCOTCH while
indicating to the bartender that he’d like another

But while we can’t believe our fucking eyes remember he’s a
stranger to Ana Lucia He SMILES --

SHEPHARD
You wanded me At security

Ana gets her drink sucks on the LIME And Shephard seems to
be AMUSED by the fact that she’s completely IGNORING him

SHEPHARD (CONTD)

So how does somebody get into
wanding

13 13

ANA LUCIA
I used to be a cop

SHEPHARD
What a coincidence I used to be a
doctor

Shephard gets his drink Takes a BIG gulp And Ana -- well

ANA LUCIA
Why’d you quit

SHEPHARD

Ana shakes her head what the hell is UP with this guy

Christian moves over a seat

definitely

ANA LUCIA
Why would I go to Sydney with you

SHEPHARD
Why wouldn’t you

ANA LUCIA
Because you’re a stranger And
youve had two drinks just since
I’ve been talking to you And I
don’t go to (fucking) Australia
just to go

more INTIMATE

SHEPHARD
I always have two drinks for the
road because it’s good luck and I
don’t want to crash And if you
need a reason to go to Australia
here’s a great one --

(beat)
What I’m doing down there is
dangerous I need someone to

protect me A bodyguard Perfect
for someone who “used to be a cop”

ANA LUCIA
Protect you from what

SHEPHARD
Does it matter

Ana Lucia just looks at him He looks back

KINDRED SPIRITS

CARRY-ON

Pulls out a worn MANILA ENVELOPE

Reaches inside roots around -- and extracts
HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS Pushes it across to Ana

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Payment in advance

ANA LUCIA
You’re crazy man

Not sexual at all

-- but

Somehow
After a beat he reaches into his leather

a WAD OF
Lucia 13

SHEPHARD
Maybe
(then)
But maybe I’m not and fate has
thrown you and me together Two
drinks in at an airport bar

ANA LUCIA
And why would “fate” do that

SHEPHARD
Same reason fate does anything
so we can help each other
(beat)
Don’t you need help

And this time when he looks at her it’s a REAL MOMENT

Bonding

She can see the same thing in his eyes we can -- a

real level of SADNESS AND DESPERATION

And Ana Lucia is actually fucking CONSIDERING THIS She

looks down at the money Back up at Shephard points to
herself and then to him --

And if we

She SMILES

Ana Lucia

ANA LUCIA
That ain’t gonna happen

don’t get her gist Shephard certainly does --

SHEPHARD
Darlin’ -- I couldn’t if I tried

- Charmed by his honesty

ANA LUCIA
I don’t even know your name

SHEPHARD
Let’s not use our real names That
keeps it nice and professional
Tell you what you pick mine
I’ll pick yours

shakes her head -- can’t believe she’s fucking

getting into this But she IS getting into it So --

ANA LUCIA
You look like a “Tom” to me 13

SHEPHARD
Tom is an excellent name
(thinks then)
And you should be “Sarah”
Ana nods So fucking be it She raises her eyebrow --

ANA LUCIA
You said two was good luck huh

Shephard SMILES back --

SHEPHARD
I believe I did

And Shephard raises his finger to the bartender --

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Another drink for the lady

And OFF ANA LUCIA a FLASH OF AMBIVALENCE -- not exactly sure
WHY the fuck she just agreed to WHAT she just agreed to
but that doesn’t really matter right now

Because she’s going to fucking SYDNEY

Ana Lucia just looks at him He GRINS --

SAWYER (CONTD)
That’s the one about guns

ANA LUCIA

Funny

Ana Lucia keeps her expression even but Sawyer clocks
something Whatever she wants it for it ain’t GOOD

SAWYER
Hey here’s an idea Why not go to
your buddy Jack He’s got himself
a gun
(snaps his fingers)
Oh right -- he’s still traipsing
through the jungle with Kate

ANA LUCIA
If you’ve got a problem ‘cause he’s
making time with your girlfriend
don’t take it out on me man

Sawyer looks at her his eyes cold -- he can throw out wise
ass remarks all day but Ana just hit him where he LIVES
And she doesn’t let up Takes a step forward Eye to EYE 14

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
So how about you just give me a
gun

SAWYER
Here’s another idea -- scram

Ana blinks A beat But Sawyer’s OVER IT now --

SAWYER (CONT’D)
You heard me Not git

She eyes him like she just might bite his fucking nose off
But after a beat she breaks away Turns around And walks
off AND OFF SAWYER watching her go --

So it worked

Jack turns to see Locke standing in the door observing them

JACK
What are you talking about John

LOCKE
Your deal -- the trade If they
gave us Michael back

JACK
They didn’t give us anything

Locke is slightly CONFUSED Not to mention his head is
still fucking TRIPPED OUT from his conversation with Henry

LOCKE
So it’s just a coincidence that he
came wandering out when you --

JACK
I was shouting He heard my voice

Locke nods noncommittally Jack getting DEFENSIVE now --

15

JACK (CONTD)
What They sent Michael back just
hoping we’d keep up our end of the
bargain You think they’re on the

ON SAYID digging a hole A VOICE calls out to him --

HURLEY (0S)
Dude nice hole

Sayid looks up and see Hurley approaching

SAYID
What is it Hurley

HURLEY
Hey Man you remember that radio
we made I thought maybe I could
like get it to play some music
yknow for Libby

Ah There it is Sayid nods sympathetic --

SAYID
It worked only once and then just
for a minute I’ve tried numerous
times since and gotten only static

HURLEY
I know but here’s the thing
even that’d be good ‘Cause then
Libby’1l be all like “It’s the
thought that counts” Then I score
Major points Especially when she
sees me holding it over my head

Sayid looks at Hurley -- confused

SAYID
And why would you hold a static
generating radio over your head

HURLEY

They didn’t have “Say Anything” in
Baghdad

(off his blank look)
It’s awesome This dude like gets
a boom-box and holds it over his
head outside the chick’s window
and he plays some Peter Gabriel
song And bam The girl’s like
his I mean after her father goes
to jail But then he gets her
And he’s a kickboxer --

SAYID
I think I get the idea

HURLEY
You should check it out sometime
I mean if we ever yknow get off
the island

Sayid shakes his head Charmed by the site of young love

SAYID
If you want to do something nice
for Libby there’s a beautiful
beach maybe three kilometers from
here Pack a picnic basket and
take her there

HURLEY
You think that’d work

Sayid nods Yes he does Hurley’s starting to dig this
plan Then Sayid resumes digging his smile fading as --

SAYID
I took Shannon there once

Oh yeah Shannon Remember her Hurley does Suddenly

feels for Sayid But Sayid quickly lets him off the hook --

SAYID (CONTD)
Would you like directions

As Hurley NODS back

ON SAWYER as he walks through the jungle He stops Looks
around Produces a papaya from his pack and takes a bite
Chews Then he starts moving again

A BEAT Then he SUDDENLY STOPS There it is -- that
RUSTLING behind him And then it stops Yup there’s
somebody out there He turns --

SAWYER
Come out come out whoever you
are

Nothing Not a sound And now Sawyer draws his GUN --
SAWYER (CONTD)
I know you’re there -- don’t make

me come in after you

A beat then -- Ana Lucia emerges from the brush

SAWYER (CONTD)
Well well well -- look what we
got here Was Little Red Riding
Hood gonna follow the Big Bad Wolf
to his stash o’ guns

ANA LUCIA
Why not gimme that one right there

Sawyer puts the gun back in his waistband --

SAWYER
I ain’t gonna gimmyou nothin’

But Ana Lucia isn’t taking no for an answer starts moving
towards him --

SAWYER (CONTD)
You and me been over this Lucy --

-- She keeps right on going getting right in his face --

SAWYER (CONT’D)
Hey --

And WHAM Ana Lucia fucking PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE Sawyer
stumbles backward -- goes down like a sack of wheat

SAWYER (CONTD)
What the --

17

Ana Lucia jumps on top of him tries to hold him down --

And while Sawyer doesn’t exactly hate being this close to her
he ain’t letting this little chickie get the best of him He
wastes no time in using his superior strength to flip her
over BOOM Her BACK SLAMS AGAINST the jungle floor Now
HE’S ON TOP and pinning her down He leans in close She
feels his breath on her face --

SAWYER (CONTD)
What’cha gonna do now Muchacha

They’re sweaty nose to nose Heat and anger burning from
their eyes their bodies pressed tightly together And just
as we wonder what she’s going to do Ana Lucia suddenly jerks
her head up and meets Sawyer’s lips with her own

Holy shit Her mouth is hungry she’s more biting and
grabbing at him than kissing him And even in his surprise
Sawyer wastes no time in opening his mouth to her and giving
it right back

She reaches for his head and SMASHES IT between her hands in
a VICE GRIP Her hands slide down his scalp PULLING HIS
HAIR BACK as she ROLLS ON TOP OF HIM

ONCE THERE she puts one hand on his neck while pulling his
hair back with the other All the while KISSING HIM And

quickly he’s had enough FLIPS HER OVER AGAIN and HOLDS HER
HANDS DOWN OVER HER HEAD

HE RUNS HIS HAND down her TORSO and then in ONE DEFT MOVE
HE PULLS HER SHIRT OFF She squirms beneath him IN ONLY HER
BRA Now it’s her turn -- SHE FLIPS HIM OVER GRABS HIS
BELT YANKS IT OFF and FLINGS IT out of the way

They KISS angry HARD and it’s impossible to tell really
whether they want to FIGHT OR FUCK He looks at her
wondering how far this is going to go And Ana’s response is
to unbutton SAWYER’S PANTS

WE PAN OFF TO THE BELT LAYING ON THE GROUND PARTIALLY
COVERED BY ANA LUCIA’S SHIRT

AND AS SAWYER’S GUN FALLS ON TOP OF THE PILE

SMASH TO BLACK

END OF ACT TWO

ACT THREE
EXT JUNGLE - DAY 18

TIGHT ON A PAIR OF JEANS laying on the jungle floor as a
HAND reaches into FRAME and grabs them

WIDEN TO REVEAL shirtless Sawyer Getting dressed in all his
post-coital glory HE STEALS A GLANCE AT --

Ana Lucia’s BACK as she throws on her familiar black tank
top She turns around catches him looking at her --

ANA LUCIA
What

Jesus This is AWKWARD And now Ana Lucia simply takes off
Not a word or a look to Sawyer who can’t believe his usual
role of loving ‘em and leaving ‘em is being reversed This
is the PERFECT SCENARIO -- she’s fucking leaving

SAWYER
Don’t you want my phone number

Ana Lucia turns around her eyes smoldering --

ANA LUCIA
If you tell anyone about this I’11l
kill you

SAWYER
Guess that takes cuddlin’ off the
table

And we PUSH IN TIGHT on Ana Lucia’s FACE as she goes not
even a hint of a smile --

INT SYDNEY HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 19

Ana Lucia lies on top of the kicked out sheets of her bed
Insomnia-ville CANNOT FUCKING SLEEP She looks at the
CLOCK RADIO 351 AM FUCK

She gets up out of bed opens the MINI-BAR Cracks open a
mini bottle of tequila and pours it in a glass She mixes in
some tonic but doesn’t drink She whirls it with her finger
instead as she moves to the window and looks out at the
twinkling lights of Sydney Harbour

She stares out wonders how in fuck she got here SUDDENLY
-- POUNDING ON HER DOOR -- only one person it could be She
puts the drink down and moves to the DOOR --

19

SHEPHARD (0S)
Saarrah Open the damn door

Yeah Christian She opens the door TO REVEAL A VERY DRUNK
Christian Shephard holding the door frame to steady himself --

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Good you’re up Protection
duty It’s time Let’s go

Ana Lucia looks at him suspicious and skeptical --

ANA LUCIA
After four days of drinking
doing nothing -- now in the middle

of the night you’re ready to go

He nods Damn STRAIGHT --

SHEPHARD
That’s exactly right Now
c’mon It’s time Get dressed

OFF ANA LUCIA pondering What the fuck Sooner started
sooner finished AND AS THUNDER CRASHES --

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - SYDNEY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 20

RAIN POURS DOWN AS A LONE CAR cruises ghost-like down the
street in a working class neighborhood of modest homes

INT CAR - DRIVING - FLASHBACK 21
Ana Lucia drives Christian swigs from a MINI BOTTLE of

scotch He scans the street points to a RUN-DOWN HOUSE with
a RUSTED OUT JEEP parked in the driveway --

SHEPHARD
That’s it -- that’s the one Pull
in

ANA LUCIA

This is what I’m protecting you
from The suburbs

SHEPHARD
Just stay here

ANA LUCIA

(pissed)
Should I keep the meter running

21

But Christian’s out of the car SLAMMING the door and
heading up the front walk He’s INSTANTLY SOAKED

WE STAY IN THE CAR WITH ANA LUCIA WINDSHIELD WIPERS GOING --
watching from HER POV as --

CHRISTIAN RINGS THE BELL AND KNOCKS ON THE DOOR Aman ona
mission

Finally a light comes on Then the door opens revealing
LINDSEY an attractive but weathered blonde in her FORTIES

She’s surprised to see Christian and not very happy about it
Christian -- DRUNK AND IMPASSIONED -- tries to explain

something to her -- and from the looks of it it’s something
that’s been weighing on his mind for a long time

Whatever the explanation it ain’t working Lindsey starts
to CRY cinches her robe tighter and SHAKES HER HEAD NO

Christian starts to YELL in frustration his voice RISING TO
A LEVEL where Ana Lucia can NOW HEAR --

SHEPHARD LINDSEY
Tell me where she is --
-- Go home Christian
You’re drunk

SHEPHARD LINDSEY
She’s my daughter I have a
right to see her -- You don’t have any rights
Get OUT

Lindsey tries to SLAM THE DOOR CLOSED but Christian sticks
his foot in it She pushes hard against the door and
Christian APPLIES A SHOULDER AND -- BLAM -- IT BASHES OPEN
That’s enough for Ana Lucia --

EXT LINDSEY’S HOUSE - SYDNEY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 22

She’s out of the car and rushing for the house as --

Christian tries to PUSH IN PAST Lindsey but she HOLDS HER

GROUND GRABS HIM -- PUSHING -- SCREAMING --
LINDSEY SHEPHARD
GET -- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE --

-- This is MY house I pay
your mortgage Let me --

Christian GRABS Lindsey TRIES TO MOVE HER SHE SCREAMS --

22

Ana Lucia rolls up and pops Christian with a forearm to the
side of the head -- STOPS HIM -- grabs him in AN ARM BAR

SHEPHARD
OW What (the fuck) are you

doing Let go of me

Lindsey clearly has no idea who this WOMAN is who has come to
her aid but she doesn’t really care SHOUTS at Shephard --

LINDSEY
DON’T EVER COME BACK HERE

Ana Lucia’s got control of him This is cop 101 She uses
her arm bar leverage to turn Christian around --

ANA LUCIA
It’s okay We’re leaving

LINDSEY
You get him away from me He’s
poison He’s poison

That sentiment LANDS on Ana Lucia as she marches Christian
across the LAWN both of them getting DRENCHED in the rain --

SHEPHARD
Let me GO I was just having a
conversation --

ANA LUCIA
Your conversation’s (fucking) over

SHEPHARD
You work for me

She TORQUES his arm harder gets him to the car --

ANA LUCIA
Shut up

She opens the CAR DOOR and shoves him inside Gives one last
look back to the house --

And as Ana Lucia locks eyes with Lindsey a MOMENT And as
Lindsey shakes her head a sense of PITY from this complete
stranger Pity that Ana is now saddled with the same man
she clearly fucking HATES

LOCKE (CONT’D)
I must’ve left the tap on in the
bathroom sink it flooded over
Ana wiped out banged her head on
the counter

(to Ana)
Again -- I’m sorry about that
A moment ON LOCKE -- long enough to realize that he knows

what might happen to Henry if his attempted murder came to
light And that he ain’t done TALKING to him

Ana Lucia is SURPRISED he covered her but grateful too

ANA LUCIA
Yeah Don’t worry about it

And Jack He’s NOT sure what the fuck is going on but why

INT HATCH - GEODOME - DAY 27

Locke sits at the computer working on his MAP as Jack enters
And there’s something about Jack right now He is actually
PENSIVE Awkward He’s got something to say and now he just
fucking says it --

JACK
You were right

LOCKE
Right about what

JACK
About Henry

Locke looks UP Whoa This is fucking big

JACK (CONTD)
What you and Sayid did to him when
you first found him You were
right I never should’ve
(beat owning it)
I don’t like how you did it but I
shouldn’t have got in your way

And that’s about as close to SORRY as Jack Shephard ever gets

LOCKE
You did what you thought was right
at the time you thought it Jack

Jack NODS relieved that Locke is being so chill And then --

LOCKE (CONTD)

But I hope the next time you decide

to do something you include me
(beat pointed)

And something tells me that’s gonna

be soon

27

THERE IT IS Fun time over Locke and Jack are at least
for the next two minutes BACK IN BUSINESS together Jack
gets off the couch IMPASSIONED NOW --

JACK
You heard what Michael said We
can take them

LOCKE
(devil’s advocate)
Our friend with the beard told us
not to cross the “line”

JACK
These people are liars John -- why
the hell should we take their word
for anything

A beat as Locke looks across the hatch to the ARMORY DOOR
And the man fucking BEHIND it And then --

LOCKE
I couldn’t agree more

ON LOCKE fierce DETERMINATION twinkling in his eyes --

LOCKE (CONTD)
So now what

INT HATCH - LIVING AREA - DAY 28

ON KATE as she fills a bottle of water at the sink Feels

(then points)
It’s just -- that’s my shirt

Uh what Kate looks down at the shirt she’s wearing
instantly self-conscious --

KATE
Oh I found it in the luggage

ANA LUCIA
Looks good on you You keep it

4l
28

(Producer’s note And before we get busted on this the prior
scene where we played this gag was cut from that show) Ana
Lucia SMILES at the absurdity of the situation And now Kate
smiles BACK Wow could they actually be bonding

That’s when Jack and Locke enter -- and you can feel the
TENSION -- they’re READY TO MOVE -- PACKS ON THEIR SHOULDERS
KATE
Where are you going
LOCKE
To get our guns back from Sawyer
JACK
(to Kate)

And we’re gonna need you to help

ANA LUCIA

Now Kate grabs HER pack and the three of them exit out And
as soon as they’re gone we PUSH IN ON ANA LUCIA as she
TURNS TO LOOK TOWARD THE ARMORY DOOR --

INT CAR - DRIVING - EARLY MORNING - FLASHBACK 29
Ana Lucia’s behind the wheel Quiet

Next to her Shephard dishevelled from their TOUSLE on the
front lawn tips his mini-bottle all the way back draining

the very last drop into his throat He reaches out to the
car radio --

29 29

SHEPHARD
We need some damn music in here

Shephard finds something mournful and bluesy The two drive
on silently for a few beats Then --

ANA LUCIA
Who was she

SHEPHARD
Who was who

ANA LUCIA
(“don’t play around”)
That woman

SHEPHARD
She Is a very long story Sarah

ANA LUCIA
My name’s Ana Lucia

Shephard acknowledges that Ana no longer wants to play his
game A beat And then --

SHEPHARD
Well I’m still “Tom”

She shakes her head getting pretty SICK of this --

ANA LUCIA
You’re pathetic is what you are

SHEPHARD
You bet your sweet ass I am

He reaches over to CRANK up the radio but Ana’s had ENOUGH --
FRUSTRATED -- she CRANKS THE WHEEL -- SCREEEEECH -- PULLS
OVER TO THE CURB SLAMS it into PARK -- TURNS ON Shephard --

ANA LUCIA
What the hell are we -- Why are
you here man

SHEPHARD
Why are you here

ON ANA Shit Well that’s a GOOD FUCKING QUESTION

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Because I know exactly why I’m
here

(MORE) 29
SHEPHARD (CONTD)
I’m here because I can’t apologize
to my son He tried to help me and
I I thanked him by cutting him
off By hating him
(beat pointed)
Your turn Ana

OUCH Ana feels like she’s been SLAPPED

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
You fly halfway around the world
with a stranger at the drop of a
hat and I’m “pathetic”

ANA LUCIA
You said you needed someone to
protect you Not just sit around
and watch you (fucking) drink

A beat Shephard looks at her And here’s that terrible
part of him we’ve seen in the past That MEAN part

SHEPHARD
You came here for the same reason I

did kiddo You ran away

That’s pretty much a verbal KNOCKOUT PUNCH Ana Lucia looks
away pissed and sad that this fucker is right

A BEAT then Shephard suddenly SMILES as he CLOCKS SOMETHING
ACROSS THE STREET

SHEPHARD (CONTD)
Well Look where fate’s delivered
us this time

Ana follows his eyes There across the street aBAR --
“THE LAST CALL” Shephard offers a sad smile

ANA LUCIA
It’s five-thirty in the morning

SHEPHARD
Good we won’t have to fight the
crowds Let’s go have a drink or
ten and be pathetic together
C’mon

Ana Lucia looks at him -- a mixture of PITY and ANGER And
her answer JUST COMES OUT --

ANA LUCIA
No 29

She’s having herself an EPIPHANY HERE A moment of CLARITY
where she SEES that SHEPARD is MERELY HERSELF four steps down
the road More FORCEFUL now --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)

SHEPHARD
If that’s your call

He seems disappointed but turns the DOOR HANDLE to leave
As it swings open -- SLAM -- it CRASHES into a PEDESTRIAN --

PEDESTRIAN (0S)
Hey I’m walking here

And the fucking voice is damn familiar HOLY FUCKING SHIT --
were on HIS BACK BUT WE SEE ENOUGH OF HIM TO KNOW THAT IT’S
FUCKING SAWYER HEADING INTO THAT BAR

Ana Lucia turns back towards Shephard as he gets out --

ANA LUCIA
Wait

Because her gut is telling her that if she lets this guy go
in that bar something fucking terrible is going to happen
And we know she’s right because after Christian Shephard has

aheart-to-heart with Sawyer in that bar he is going to die
in the fucking alley behind it

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
Don’t You don’t have to -- let’s
just get the hell out of Sydney
(beat emotional)
Let’s just go back

Shephard looks at her Then softly BECAUSE IT’S SO FUCKING
HARD FOR HIM TO SAY --

SHEPHARD
I can’t ever go back
(then)
See ya kiddo

And with that Christian Shephard gets out of the car And
WALKS OFF across the street And into that bar like a man
to the gallows And OFF ANA LUCIA as she watches him go

EXT BEACH - DAY 30

ON A MANUSCRIPT WE READ THE TITLE “BAD TWIN” WIDENING to
find it in the hands of Sawyer in front of his CAMPFIRE
Totally ENGROSSED --

JACK (0S)
Sawyer

Sawyer barely looks up as Kate Jack and Locke (on crutches)
approach his tent Just turns the page --

JACK (CONTD)
Put the book down

SAWYER

It ain’t a book it’s a manuscript
and I’m gonna be the first and only
guy to find out who-done-it

(turns another page)
I think I might’ve figured it out
so just cool your damn jets and
take a walk around the coconut
trees Only got ten pages to go

JACK
You wanna figure it out

But Jack’s jets ain’t gonna cool so he GRABS THE MANUSCRIPT
RIPS OUT the last several PAGES and THROWS THEM IN THE FIRE

SAWYER
HEY

He leaps up GRABS a stick -- KNOCKS the flaming pages out of
the fire -- STOMPS THEM OUT Takes a knee to find that the
pages are half ASH

SAWYER (CONTD)
What the hell d’you do that for

JACK
Time to give us the guns back

SAWYER

SAWYER
(to Jack)
What You brought her along for
the sympathy vote Well she ain’t
in my head Doc so go screw

Qw ON KATE uncomfortable that Sawyer has crossed into this
territory Jack deals with it another way -- pulls out HIS
fucking gun sticks it in Sawyer’s face --

JACK
Take us to the guns Right now

Now Sawyer has a moment of realization He doesn’t have his
fucking gun He forgot about it He involuntarily reaches
anyway for the back of his waistband like you’d check for
your missing wallet Nothing Double fuck

SAWYER
That bitch She stole my damn gun
(off Jack’s look)
Ana Lucia

JACK
How’d she do that

Sawyer’s not about to tell Jack that --

SAWYER
Sonofabitch

JACK
What does she need a gun for

Locke knows why to get fucking revenge He realizes he
might have seriously fucked up

LOCKE
Jack I need to tell you
something
INT HATCH - LIVING AREA - DAY 31

CLOSE ON THE GUN Sticking out of the back of Ana’s jeans

31

She pulls it out Slips out the cartridge checks the load
Uses the back of her hand to wipe the beads of sweat off her
forehead Blinks Then SMASHES it back in

INT HATCH - ARMORY - DAY 32

SWOOSH The door slides open Ana Lucia reaches into her
pocket pulls out her KA-BAR and SLIDES IT ACROSS THE ROOM
PAN OVER as the KNIFE SKIDS ACROSS THE FLOOR and LANDS AT
HENRYS FEET He looks up to Ana Lucia questioningly --

ANA LUCIA
Pick it up and cut yourself loose

HENRY
What

ANA LUCIA
Just do it

HENRY
Why

Ana Lucia ain’t about to EXPLAIN the situation to him --

ANA LUCIA
You know why

Her tone is dead fucking serious Henry picks up the knife
with his BOUND HANDS HIS EYES WIDEN with recognition --

HENRY
I remember this knife
(beat)
The woman you took it from The
woman you murdered Her name was
Jennifer

Ana Lucia looks at him knowing damn well she got that knife
off the body of the WOMAN SHE KILLED WITH A ROCK

Henry starts to CUT THROUGH HIS ROPES shakes his head --
HENRY (CONTD)
He kept saying you were

“misunderstood”

ANA LUCIA
What’re you talking --

HENRY
Goodwin

32 32

Henry knows she’s captivated -- milks it for all it’s worth --

HENRY (CONTD)

Yes He told us all about you
Ana He thought you were worthy
that he could change you

(off Ana Lucia)
But he was wrong

(goes back to cutting)
And it cost him his life

ANA LUCIA
(shaken)
He he was gonna kill me

Henry looks up to her his eyes as innocent as a lamb’s --

HENRY
Was he

Ana Lucia blinks Because she’s asked herself that same
question over and over again But this is not a woman who
psychoanalyzes herself No She fucking TAKES ACTION

ANA LUCIA
You finished

ON HENRY as he lifts up his hands now free from the ropes
Opens them in a gesture of surrender

HENRY
Yes Ana I’m finished

And now she reaches around to the back of her jeans And
removes her gun Holds it at her side Henry looks at her
with a sense of acceptance Completely FEARLESS

HENRY (CONTD)
So this is it huh

ANA LUCIA
Yeah Henry This is it

AND AS ANA LUCIA RAISES HER GUN POINTS IT RIGHT AT HENRY’S
FUCKING HEAD --

END OF ACT FOUR

ACT FIVE
INT SYDNEY AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER - DAY - FLASHBACK 33
We’‘re in the SYDNEY AIRPORT
And here’s Jack Wearing the very same SUIT we saw him

wearing in the PILOT He stands at the OCEANIC CUSTOMER
SERVICE COUNTER And he is fucking losing it

JACK
What do you mean you won’t put it
on the plane

That’s right folks We are back in the scene where Jack is
screaming at the TICKET AGENT to get his FATHER’S CASKET on
the PLANE Jin waits in line behind Jack SUN in the bg
deciding whether or not to leave Jin We stay ON JACK --

JACK (CONTD)
I want you to listen to me okay
Because I am asking you a favor
(reads her name-tag)

“Chrissy” I am standing in front
of you wearing the same suit I’m
wearing to my father’s funeral and
I’m asking you a favor

And now we PAN the CROWD the CAMERA SEARCHING SEARCHING
until it LANDS ON -- ANA LUCIA

She’s watching Jack listening to him And even though we
knew she overheard the conversation now we get to SEE HER
WATCH IT AND JACK IS FUCKING YELLING NOW --

JACK (CONTD)
And I need that coffin to clear
customs because there is going to
be a hearse waiting there And
that hearse needs to take me and
that coffin to the cemetery Why
Chrissy Why can’t I just land and
bring him to a funeral home and
make all the arrangements there
Why can’t I really take my time
with it Because I need it to be
done I need it to be over

And of course she has nary a fucking idea that the man in
that coffin is her friend “Tom”

But still Ana Lucia can understand Her features soften
We see the sympathy in her eyes as she watches Jack

33

Suddenly Ana Lucia pulls out her CELL PHONE and DIALS She
brings the phone to her ear WE HEAR RINGING ON THE OTHER
END THEN --

ANSWERING MACHINE
This is Captain Teresa Cortez
please leave a message

Ana Lucia is calling her mother

But she doesn’t leave a message With a conflicted look on
her face she simply HANGS UP --

UPCUT TO
INT SYDNEY AIRPORT - BAR - DAY - FLASHBACK 34

Jack’s at the bar nursing a cocktail Ana Lucia sits down
next to him --

ANA LUCIA
Tequila and tonic with a wedge of
lemon

Yes We’re back in that scene The scene where Jack and Ana

Lucia met for the first time ONLY THIS TIME -- WE KNOW
EVERYTHING

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
Why were you yelling

ON JACK -- Is she talking to him
ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
The girl at the check-in counter
You were yelling at her

Jack turns not quite ready for this invasion of privacy --

JACK
I’m sorry -- do I know you

The Woman smiles undaunted
ANA LUCIA
I’m on your flight L A
(sips her drink then)
So your dad died huh

AND WE FUCKING CRINGE because we know even what they do not

Ana Lucia came to Australia with Christian Shephard and met
him in a bar just like she’s meeting Jack

34

We also know Ana Lucia now And as the scene plays out we
recognize that this tough-guy-bravado covers a sad and hurt
and lonely woman So we play the scene out in full because
it’s a different scene now that we know what lies beneath

And she SMILES actually cracking Jack’s veneer

JACK
Yeah my dad died

ANA LUCIA
How

JACK

(hesitates then)
Heart attack

Jack lifts his cocktail to his lips takes a healthy GULP
but he makes a FACE as it goes down

ANA LUCIA
Not a drinker huh

JACK
(owning it)
No No not really

She downs the rest of her drink and gives Jack the once over

JACK (CONTD)
So what’s your name

ANA LUCIA
Ana Lucia

JACK
So tell me Ana Lucia why’re you
drinking tequila and tonics at ten
‘til noon

ANA LUCIA
I hate flying And they stuck me
in the back of the plane where the
wheels come down right under your
damn feet So where are you
sitting

Jack takes out his ticket Checks it --

JACK
23B 34

ANA LUCIA
42F
(smiles )
Wanna trade

Jack smiles back -- but before he can answer her phone
RINGS Ana Lucia checks the caller ID FLIPS IT OPEN --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
(into phone )
Hey Yeah I’m in Sydney
Hold on

She sups the phone

ANA LUCIA JACK
Sorry -- k
-- Jack

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
Jack I gotta talk We’ll have
the next drink on the plane okay

JACK
42F

ANA LUCIA
42F right

She smiles touches his arm ON Jack fully fucking
intrigued And right before she turns away --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
And Jack Worst part’s over

And now we know that maybe just maybe she means that for
herself too So Jack smiles and then we go where we’ve
never gone before WE FOLLOW ANA LUCIA OUT OF THE BAR

INT SYDNEY AIRPORT - TERMINAL - DAY - FLASHBACK 35

Now entering the terminal Ana Lucia’s smile fades and her
face fucking falls as she stops brings the phone to her ear

ANA LUCIA
Hi mom No I didn’t leave a
message Yeah that’s right

Australia

Ana Lucia’s mystery call WAS HER MOTHER And now we hear
her MOTHER’S VOICE on the other end of the phone --

35

CORTEZ
Why are you in Australia

No fucking easy answer to that question --

ANA LUCIA
I don’t know I uhm

And now we start to PUSH IN TIGHTER AND TIGHTER ON ANA LUCIA
as all of her efforts at holding it together crumble beneath
the weight of her pain and the sound of her mother’s voice
Her mouth quivers her eyes fill with floods of tears --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
-l did something bad

A LONG BEAT THEN she chokes out --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
»You knew and I got as far
away from you as I could but
now I wanna come home Mom

It’s a child’s plea for help and her mother hears it A
beat then --

CORTEZ
So come home

ANA LUCIA
I’m at the airport right now
I’m on Oceanic Flight 815

CORTEZ
Ill be there when you land
querida

ON ANA LUCIA still crying but now her face floods with
relief and something altogether new to her HOPE

INT HATCH - LIVING AREA - DAY 36

CLOSE ON A GUN THE gun And it’s SHAKING PANNING UP TO
FIND IT IN THE HAND OF --

Ana Lucia She sits on the couch eyes down Holds the gun
against her thigh And we see now why it’s shaking --

It’s because SHE’S fucking shaking

And since the last time we saw her was in the armory pointing
that gun at Henry’s fucking HEAD we have a good idea why

36

VOICE (0S)
Where is everybody

Ana Lucia instantly stiffens turns to see Michael Wobbly
but on his feet Still looking like hell Ana becomes self-
conscious tries to play cool Tries

ANA LUCIA
Whatever you said got ‘em worked
up They went to get all the guns
from Sawyer

MICHAEL
(processes this then)
Sawyer Has all the guns

ANA LUCIA
Long story

Michael shakes his head Limps over Settles down on the
couch next to her Nods to the gun in her hand --

MICHAEL
At least he didn’t get that one

ANA LUCIA
Yeah
(then)
Too bad I can’t (fucking) use it

Ana Lucia looks up at Michael a mixture of anger
vulnerability and SELF-FUCKING-DISGUST

MICHAEL
Use it on what

Ana nods towards the ARMORY DOOR We see now it is still
tightly CLOSED Yeah Henry is still ALIVE AND WELL

ANA LUCIA
We caught one One of them The
Others Got him locked up in
there

ON MICHAEL as he turns to look at the door And SOMETHING in
his eyes -- maybe DISBELIEF -- or maybe the idea that he is
THIS close to one of those FUCKERS

MICHAEL ANA LUCIA
How long has he --

-- Over a week 36

MICHAEL
And youre taking care of him

Feeding him

ANA LUCIA
Yeah I’ve been I --
(then looks away)
He tried to kill me today I saw
it in his eyes He wanted me dead

Michael turns back to her Speechless Ana takes a breath
STRUGGLING with this Continues --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
So I wanted him dead Because
people like that They -- they
should be

And now the TEARS are starting to come She hates it
HATES it But she can’t fucking HELP it either

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)

He called me a killer but I
can’t I can’t do it I can’t
even kill him

(losing it)
I couldn’t do it -- I I looked

down at him and he

And Ana Lucia looks up at Michael laid completely bare In
this moment To this relative STRANGER She just says it --

ANA LUCIA (CONTD)
I can’t do it anymore

Michael just looks at her Not without empathy but there
is a HARDNESS here now Something he brought back with him
from the jungle A long Long BEAT Then finally --

MICHAEL
Then let me do it

Oh Shit Fuck WOW

Ana Lucia BLINKS Just as surprised as we are Michael
moves closer to her His OWN eyes watering now --

MICHAEL (CONTD)
They’re animals I’ve seen
these people and they’re animals

(anger rising)
They took my son
(MORE) 36
MICHAEL (CONTD)
Right out of my hands They took
him and they
(stops himself measured)
I’ll do it Give me the gun and
I’11 kill him
(finally chilling)
Because that’s what they’d do

ON ANA LUCIA TORN But knowing Michael is right And
knowing of all the people on the island no one more than him
has more REASON to fucking do it

So Michael puts out his hand

And after a long beat -- a long moment of DECISION -- Ana
Lucia slowly hands him the fucking gun Jesus

MICHAEL (CONTD)
What’s the combination

ANA LUCIA
Eighteen to the right One to the
left Thirty-one to the right

BACK ON MICHAEL -- And his expression changes -- as if he’s
in great EMOTIONAL PAIN that he can’t restrain anymore A
single TEAR slips down his cheek And then very very
softly he says --

MICHAEL
I’m sorry

ANA LUCIA
(confused)
For what

Michael abruptly STANDS Points the gun at Ana Lucia

BLAM
He shoots her POINT BLANK

And Ana’s eyes barely register surprise as she slides off the
couch SLUMPS into a seated position

She looks up at Michael still pointing the gun at her as she
opens her mouth -- but it’s not drawn out No Because a
moment later her body just goes SLACK

Her eyes stay open but the lights are out

Ana Lucia Cortez is dead 36

VOICE (0S)
(confused)
Michael --

BLAM BLAM

And Michael is fucking SHOOTING before he even sees what he’s
shooting at -- INSTINCT now as he WHIPS AROUND towards the
sound of that voice and REVEAL --

LIBBY

SHOCKED HOLDING THE BLANKETS SHE WAS GETTING FOR HER PICNIC
WITH HURLEY A BLACKENED HOLE now permeates in the center of

those blankets as Libby’s knees fucking BUCKLE --

She hits the ground like a back of rocks Over DONE
Oh sweet fucking CHRIST

TIME STOPS ON MICHAEL FREAKING OUT SWEATING BLINKING
HIS GUN HAND FUCKING TREMBLING FROZEN

And then he BREAKS it Pulls his eyes away from the dead
women as he TURNS -- INTENSE -- walks over to the ARMORY --

GIACCHINO MUSIC starts to POUND now as his SHAKING HAND spins

the COMBINATION DIAL -- eighteen to the right -- one to the
left -- thirty-one to the right HE PULLS DOWN THE HANDLE --
INT HATCH - ARMORY - CONTINUOUS 37

THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN DARK IN HERE Michael the gun at his
side BACKLIT by the living area behind him as we REVEAL

Henry Sitting in the corner Untied

And considering he just heard three gunshots and a STRANGE
MAN is now standing in the doorway of his “cell” the look on
Henry’s face is not one of FEAR

It is one of ACCEPTANCE

He stands up Faces Michael

And Michael looks at him ANOTHER tear slides down his face
as he raises the gun

And turns it on HIMSELF -- PUSHING IT AGAINST HIS COLLARBONE

37

BLAM
SMASH TO BLACK
HOLD ON BLACK FOR THREE FULL SECONDS THEN --
FADE UP
EXT BEACH - DUSK 38

A static frame WIDE Beautiful Pastoral It’sa
beautiful night A warm breeze riffles the PALMS

Hurley sits on the sand The picnic basket A bottle of
WINE next to him

Just holding this frame Holding on Hurley Waiting

And although our heart is already aching for him let’s allow
the guy one final moment of PEACE

Before it all goes to fucking shit

SMASH TO BLACK

END OF SHOW
