Beauty and the Beast

NARRATOR

Once upon a time in a faraway land a young prince lived ina
ining castle Although he had everything his heart desired
e prince was spoiled selfish and unkind But then one
inters night an old beggar woman came to the castle and
ffered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter
old Repulsed by her haggard appearance the prince sneered at
e gift and turned the old woman away but she warned him not
o be deceived by appearances for beauty is found within

nd when he dismissed her again the old womans ugliness
elted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress The prince
ried to apologize but it was too late for she had seen that
ere was no love in his heart and as punishment she
ransformed him into a hideous beast and placed a

owerful spell on the castle and all who lived there

shamed of his monstrous form the beast concealed himself
nside his castle with a magic mirror as his only window to

e outside world The rose she had offered was truly an
enchanted rose which would bloom until his twenty-first

year If he could learn to love another and earn her love in
return by the time the last petal fell then the spell would
be broken If not he would be doomed to remain a beast for
all time As the years passed he fell into despair and lost
all hope for who could ever learn to love a beast

as well as BEAST shredding his portrait The camera slowly zooms
out from the castle and we see the title Fade up on the home of BELLE She
exits the front door and begins her walk into town)

inviting route then begins to go left)

MAURICE This cant be right Where have you taken us Phillipe Wed

avoiding

everything until he almost runs over the edge of a cliff)

MAURICE Back up Back up Back up Good boy good boy Thats good
thats--back up Steady Steady Hey now Steady (PHILLIPE
finally bucks him off) Phillipe (PHILLIPE runs away leaving

MAURICE on the edge of the cliff) Phillipe Oh no (He looks
up and sees WOLVES growling at him MAURICE runs away being
chased by the WOLVES He stumbles down a hill and lands at

the

gate of a castle He grabs the locked gate and tries to shake
it

open)
MAURICE Help Is someone there

(The gate opens and MAURICE runs in He slams the gate in the faces of the
WOLVES Leaving his hat on the ground as the rain begins to fall MAURICE
runs

to the castle and bangs on the door It creaks open and he enters

cautiously)
MAURICE Hello Hello
(Watching from a table near the entrance are LUMIERE and COGSWORTH)
LUMIERE (Barely whispering) Old fellow must have lost his way in the
woods
COGSWORTH (Also whispering) Keep quiet Maybe hell go away
MAURICE Is someone there
COGSWORTH Not a word Lumiere Not one word
MAURICE I dont mean to intrude but Ive lost my horse and I need a
place

to stay for the night
LUMIERE (looking at COGSWORTH like a child having just found a lost
puppy)

Oh Cogsworth have a heart
COGSWORTH Shush shush shhhhh (COGSWORTH puts hand over LUMIERES mouth
who promptly proceeds to touch his lit candle hand to

hand)

(Taps MAURICE on the side of the head MAURICE looks at

Allo
Oh (Startled he drops LUMIERE onto the floor)

(hopping over) Well now youve done it Lumiere Splendid
just peachy--aaarrrgghh (MAURICE picks up COGSWORTH)

How is this accomplished (He fiddles with COGSWORTH)

Put me down At once (MAURICE tickles the bottoms of
COGSWORTHs feet He laughs He begins to wind the spring on
the back of COGSWORTHs head twisting his face around with the
clock hands MAURICE opens the front of COGSWORTH and begins

to play with his pendulum COGSWORTH slams the door shut on

his finger) Sir close that at once do you mind

I beg your pardon its just that Ive never seen a clock
thataahi meanaah aah aah-chooo (MAURICE sneezes in
the face of COGSWORTH who proceeds to wipe his face off using
his clock hands in a very anachronistic windshield wiper

MAURICE sniffles indicating the cold he has caught from being
in the rain)
Oh you are soaked to the bone monsieur Come warm yourself

the fire
Thank you

(LUMIERE and MAURICE head towards the den with COGSWORTH running after

them )
COGSWORTH

COGSWORTH

No no no do you know what the master would do if he finds

and rushes off as the trio enters the den) I demand that you
stoprightthere (COGSWORTH tumbles down the steps

takes a seat in a large chair in front of a roaring fire) Oh
no not the masters chair (FOOTSTOOL rushes past COGSWORTH
barking up a storm) Im not seeing this Im not seeing this
(As FOOTSTOOL rushes up to him) Well hello there boy

props himself up under the feet of MAURICE COATRACK enters

removes his cloak) What service

All right this has gone far enough Im in charge here and
(COGSWORTH is run over by the (once again) anachronistic
IndyCar sounding teacart of MRS POTTS)

(Arriving by the side of MAURICE) How would you like a nice
spot of tea sir Itll warm you up in no time (Pours tea

cup (CHIP) which hops over into MAURICEs open hand)
(from face down position on carpet) No No tea no tea
CHIP (As MAURICE sips the tea) Ha ha His moustache tickles
momma

MAURICE (Startled by the cup) Oh Hello

(The door to the den slams open and a strong gust of wind blows into the
room

extinguishing LUMIEREs flames and the fire in the fireplace COGSWORTH
dives

for cover MRS POTTS begins to shake CHIP jumps back onto the tea cart
and

takes refuge from behind his mother)

CHIP Uh oh

(BEAST enters We see him in full for the first time He is on all fours
He

looks around in the darkness)

BEAST (Growling his words) Theres a stranger here

LUMIERE (who has relit his flames) Master allow me to explain The

gentleman was lost in the woods and he was cold and wet
(LUMIEREs last sentence is drowned out by the very loud growl
of BEAST which puts out his flames once again LUMIERE looks
down dejected)

COGSWORTH (Coming out from under a rug) Master Id like to take this
moment to sayI was against this from the start I tried to
stop them but would they listen to me No no no (Again
BEASTs growl drowns out COGSWORTH)

(MAURICE looks to one side of the chair then to the other and sees BEAST)

BEAST Who are you What are you doing here
MAURICE (Very scared and backing away from the advancing BEAST) I was
lost
in the woods and(stares at BEAST)
BEAST (Advancing on him) You are not welcome here
MAURICE Im sorry
BEAST What are you staring at
MAURICE (Cowering under BEAST) Noth-noth-nothing (Turns to leave)
BEAST (Racing around and blocking the entrance with surprising speed)
So youve come to stare at the beast have you
MAURICE Please I meant no harm I just needed a place to stay
BEAST Ill give you a place to stay (BEAST picks up MAURICE
carries

him out of the room and slams the door plunging the den along
with COGSWORTH LUMIEREMRS POTTS and CHIP into darkness
Fade out)

(Fade in to BELLEs cottage seen from POV of GASTON and LEFOU)

LEFOU Heh Oh boy Belles gonna get the surprise of her life huh
Gaston
GASTON Yep This is her lucky day

(GASTON lets go of a branch which swings back and hits LEFOU in the mouth
GASTON turns to the band wedding guests and others apparently just out of
sight of BELLEs cottage)

GASTON Id like to thank you all for coming to my wedding But first
I

better go in there and propose to the girl (MINISTER
BAKER

and OTHERS laugh heartily Camera pans quickly to show
BIMBETTES

crying their eyes out To LEFOU) Now you Lefou When Belle
and
I come out that door--

LEFOU Oh I know I know (He turns and begins directing the band in
Here Comes the Bride GASTON slams a baritone over his head)

GASTON Not yet

LEFOU (From inside the instrument with his lips sticking out the

mouthpiece) Sorry
(Cut to interior of cottage BELLE is sitting in a chair reading her new
book

There is a knock at the door She puts the book down and walks to the door
She reaches up and pulls down a viewing device She peeks through and sees
an
anachronistically accurate fish-eye view of GASTON She moans and pushes
the
door open)
BELLE Gaston what a pleasantsurprise
GASTON Isnt it though Im just full of surprises You know Belle
Theres not a girl in town who wouldnt love to be in your
shoes
This is the day(GASTON pauses by a mirror and licks his
teeth
clean) This is the day your dreams come true
BELLE What do you know about my dreams Gaston
GASTON Plenty Here picture this (GASTON plops down in the chair
and
props his mud-covered feet up on BELLEs book He begins to
kick
off his boots and wiggle his toes through his hole-y socks) A
rustic hunting lodge my latest kill roasting on the fire and
my
little wife massaging my feet while the little ones play with
the dogs (BELLE looks positively disgusted GASTON gets up
next to her face) Well have six or seven
BELLE Dogs
GASTON No Belle Strapping boys like me
BELLE Imagine that (She picks up her book places a mark in it and
puts it on the shelf)
GASTON And do you know who that wife will be
BELLE Let me think
GASTON (Corners BELLE ) You Belle
BELLE (Ducking under GASTONS arms) Gaston Im speechless I really
dont know what to say
GASTON (Pushing chairs and things out of the way until he reaches
BELLE
and traps her against the door) Say youll marry me
BELLE (Reaching for the doorknob) Im very sorry Gaston but I just
dont deserve you (She twists the knob and the door opens

(this
time outward) BELLE ducks under GASTON as he tumbles out the
door and into the mud)

(The wedding band begins to play Here Comes the Bride GASTONs boots are

thrown out of the door (now opened inward) and the door is slammed shut
LEFOU

who is directing the band looks down and sees GASTONs legs sticking out of
the

mud and a PIERREs head sticking up LEFOU cuts off the band and GASTONs
head pops up with the pig on top of him He tilts his head and the pig
slides
down his back)

LEFOU So howd it go
GASTON (Picks up LEFOU by the neck) Ill have Belle for my wife make
no
mistake about that (GASTON drops LEFOU into the mud)
LEFOU (To PIERRE) Touchy
PIERRE Grunt Grunt
(GASTON walks off dejected and the focus returns to the cottage BELLE
pokes
her head out the door)
BELLE (To the chickens) Is he gone Can you imagine he asked me to

marry him Me the wife of that

boorish brainless

Madame Gaston cant you just see it

Madame Gaston his little wife

Not me no sir I guarantee it

I want much more than this provincial life
(BELLE walks into the pen and feeds the animals then runs off singing into
an
open field overlooking a beautiful valley)

I want adventure in the great wide somewhere

I want it more than I can tell

And for once it might be grand

To have someone understand

I want so much more than theyve got planned
(PHILLIPE runs into the open field BELLE looks at him disturbed that
MAURICE
is not with him)

BELLE Phillipe What are you doing here Wheres Papa Where is
he
Phillipe What happened Oh we have to find him you have to
take me to him
(BELLE unhitches the wagon from PHILLIPE Cut to exterior of the castle
gate
(How PHILLIPE brought BELLE there is a mystery seeing as PHILLIPE never made
it
to the castle with MAURICE) )
BELLE What is this place
(PHILLIPE snorts then begins to buck as if something is scaring him BELLE
dismounts and comforts him)
BELLE Phillipe please steady (She enters the gate and sees
MAURICEs
hat on the ground) Papa
(Cut to interior of castle with COGSWORTH and LUMIERE discussing events)

COGSWORTH Couldnt keep quiet could we Just had to invite him to stay
didnt we Serve him tea sit in the masters chair pet the
pooch

LUMIERE I was trying to be hospitable

(Cut back to door opening and BELLE entering castle)

BELLE Hello Is anyone here Hello Papa Papa are you here

(We follow as BELLE ascends the grand staircase and searches for her father
Cut

to kitchen where MRS POTTS is standing next to a tub of hot water CHIP hops
in)

CHIP Momma Theres a girl in the castle

MRS POTTS Now Chip I wont have you making up such wild stories
CHIP But really momma I saw her

MRS POTTS (Disgusted) Not another word Into the tub (She lifts CHIP
into the tub FEATHERDUSTER- enters)
FEATHERDUSTER
A girl I saw a girl in the castle
CHIP (poking his head out from the water) See I told ya
(Cut back to LUMIERE and COGSWORTH bickering)
COGSWORTH Irresponsible devil-may-care waxy eared slack-jawed--
BELLE Papa
(COGSWORTH and LUMIERE turn to look at the new arrival)
LUMIERE Did you see that (Running to the door and poking his head
around
the corner with COGSWORTH) Its a girl
COGSWORTH I know its a girl
LUMIERE Dont you see Shes the one The girl we have been waiting
for

She has come to break the spell (He chases after her)
COGSWORTH Wait a minute wait a minute
(BELLE advances down a narrow hallway COGSWORTH and LUMIERE sneak up behind
her and open the door that leads to the tower where MAURICE is being kept
The
door creaks open and BELLE hears the sound)
BELLE Papa Papa (COGSWORTH hides behind the door and LUMIERE
rushes
off) Hello Is someone here Wait Im looking for my
father
(She begins up the stairs but doesnt realize that LUMIERE is
watching her) Thats funny Im sure there was someone
I-I-Is there anyone here

(MAURICEs voice echoes from his cell)

MAURICE Belle

BELLE (Rushes up to the cell to find him) Oh Papa

MAURICE How did you find me

BELLE Oh your hands are like ice We have to get you out of here
MAURICE Belle I want you to leave this place

BELLE Whos done this to you

MAURICE No time to explain You must gonow

BELLE I wont leave you

(Suddenly BEAST grabs BELLEs shoulder and whips her around She drops the

torch she was carrying into a puddle and the room is dark except for one beam
of
light from a skylight)

BEAST What are you doing here
MAURICE Run Belle
BELLE Whos there Who are you
BEAST The master of this castle
BELLE Ive come for my father Please let him out Cant you see

BELLE Oh there must be some way I canwait Take me instead
BEAST You You would take his place
MAURICE Belle No You dont know what youre doing
BELLE If I did would you let him go

BEAST Yes but you must promise to stay here forever
(BELLE ponders the situation and realizes she cant see the captor)

BELLE Come into the light

(BEAST drags his legs then his whole body into the beam of light BELLE
looks

her eyes growing wider until she can stand no more and falls back to
MAURICE )

MAURICE No Belle I wont let you do this

(BELLE regains her composure then steps into the beam of light giving her a
very virgin-ish look)

BELLE You have my word

BEAST (quickly) Done

(BEAST moves over to unlock the cell and BELLE collapses to the floor with
her

head in her hands We hear the door being unlocked then MAURICE rushing
over

to BELLE)

MAURICE No Belle Listen to me Im old Ive lived my life--
(BEAST grabs him and drags him downstairs

BELLE Wait

MAURICE Belle

BELLE Wait

(Cut to ext of castle BEAST drags MAURICE towards PALLENQUIN)

MAURICE No please spare my daughter

BEAST Shes no longer your concern (BEAST throws MAURICE into the
PALLENQUIN) Take him to the village

(The PALLENQUIN breaks the ivy holding it to the ground then slinks off like

a
spider with MAURICE inside)

MAURICE Please let me out please

(Cut to BELLE looking out cell window at the PALLENQUIN crossing the bridge
over

the moat She begins to cry Cut to BEAST walking up the stairs LUMIERE is
still at his post)

LUMIERE Master

BEAST (angrily) What

LUMIERE Since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time I
was

thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable
room (BEAST growls angrily at him) Then again maybe not
(BEAST enters the cell where BELLE is still crying)

BELLE You didnt even let me say good bye Ill never see him again
I
didnt get to say good-bye
BEAST (feeling bad) Ill show you to your room
BELLE (surprised) My room (Indicating the cell) But I thought--
BEAST You wanna you wanna stay in the tower
BELLE No
BEAST Then follow me

(BEAST leads BELLE to her room As they proceed BELLE begins to lag behind
She looks at the hideous sculptures on the walls and the light casting
shadows

on them Frightened she gasps and runs to catch up with BEAST who is
carrying

LUMIERE as a light source BEAST looks back at BELLE and sees a tear form at
the corner of her eye)
LUMIERE Say something to her

BEAST Hmm Oh (To BELLE) Iumhope you like it here (He
looks
at LUMIERE for approval He motions BEAST to continue) The
castle is your home now so you can go anywhere you wish
except
the West Wing
BELLE (looking intrigued) Whats in the West Wing
BEAST (stopping angrily) Its forbidden

(BEAST continues and BELLE reluctantly follows Cut to int of BELLEs room
dark The door opens and light spills in)

BEAST (Tenderly) Now if theres anything you need my servants will
attend you

LUMIERE (whispering in his ear) Dinner--invite her to dinner

BEAST (Growing angry) Youwill join me for dinner Thats not a
request

(BEAST leaves slamming the door behind him BELLE terrified runs over to
the

bed and flings herself onto it finally breaking down and crying Fade to
tavern in the town)

GASTON Who does she think she is That girl has tangled with the
wrong

man No one says no to Gaston
LEFOU Darn right
GASTON Dismissed Rejected Publicly humiliated Why its more
than
I

can bear (turns chair away)
LEFOU (Runs in front of him) More beer
GASTON (Turns chair away again) What for Nothing helps Im
disgraced
LEFOU Who you Never Gaston youve got to pull yourself
together

Gosh it disturbs me to see you Gaston

Looking so down in the dumps

Every guy hered love to be you Gaston (cheering from the
gallery)

Even when taking your lumps

Theres no man in town as admired as you

Youre everyones favorite guy

Everyones awed and inspired by you (LEFOU turns chair back to
forward)

And its not very hard to see why

No ones slick as Gaston no ones quick as Gaston

No ones next as incredibly thick as Gaston

For theres no man in town half as manly

Perfect a pure paragon

You can ask any Tom Dick or Stanley

And theyll tell you whos team theyd prefer to be on

And his sanitys only so-so

Since I looked at that loony old man
See I promised myself Id be married to Belle
And right now Im evolving a plan

whispers)

cup)

We all think so

dress) Ah There youll look ravishing in this one

what is a Prince living on his own doing with a wardrobe full

womens clothing Maybe he wants to be a lumberjack
Thats very kind of you but Im not going to dinner
WARDROBE Oh but you must

COGSWORTH Ahem ahem ahem Dinneris served

LUMIERE looking on)

BEAST Whats taking so long I told her to come down Why isnt she

MRS POTTS Oh try to be patient sir The girl has lost her father and
her freedom all in one day

LUMIERE Uh master Have you thought that perhaps this girl could be
the one to break the spell

Again)

MRS POTTS Oh its not that easy Lumiere These things take time

LUMIERE But the rose has already begun to wilt

BEAST Its no use Shes so beautiful and Im sowell look at

MRS POTTS Oh you must help her to see past all that

BEAST I dont know how

MRS POTTS Well you can start by making yourself more presentable
Straighten up try to act like a gentleman

(BEAST sits up then straightens his face very formally)

LUMIERE (adding in) Ah yes when she comes in give her a dashing

debonair smile Come come Show me the smile (BEAST bears

his
ragged fangs in a scary and yet funny grin)

MRS POTTS But dont frighten the poor girl

LUMIERE Impress her with your rapier wit

MRS POTTS But be gentle

LUMIERE Shower her with compliments

MRS POTTS But be sincere

expectantly)

BEAST (growling) Well where is she

COGSWORTH (buying time) Who Oh The girl Yes the ah girl Well

COGSWORTH Your grace Your eminence Lets not be hasty

(Cut to ext of BELLEs room BEAST runs up to it and bangs on the door)

BEAST (Yelling) I thought I told you to come down to dinner

BELLE (From behind the door) Im not hungry

BEAST Youll come out or IllIll break down the door

LUMIERE (interrupting) Master I could be wrong but that may not be

the
best way to win the girls affections

COGSWORTH (pleading) Please Attempt to be a gentleman
BEAST (growing angrier) But she is being sodifficult
MRS POTTS Gently gently
BEAST (very dejected) Will you come down to dinner
BELLE No
(BEAST looks at the OBJECTS very frustrated)
COGSWORTH Suave Genteel
BEAST (Trying to act formal bowing at the door) It would give me
great
pleasure if you would join me for dinner
COGSWORTH Ahem ahem we say please
BEAST (once again dejected) please
BELLE (Mad at BEAST) No thank you
BEAST (furious) You cant stay in there forever
BELLE (provokingly) Yes I can
BEAST Fine Then go ahead and STARVE (To OBJECTS) If she doesnt

eat with me then she doesnt eat at all
(BEAST runs back down the hall slamming a door and causing a piece of the
ceiling to fall on LUMIERE)

MRS POTTS That didnt go very well at all did it

COGSWORTH Lumiere stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there
is the slightest change

LUMIERE (Taking guard position next to door) You can count on me mon
capitan

COGSWORTH Well I guess we better go downstairs and start cleaning up

(Cut to int of BEASTs lair BEAST enters knocking over and destroying
things
in his path)
BEAST I ask nicely but she refuses What awhat does she want me
to

do--beg (Picking up the MAGIC MIRROR) Show me the girl
(The MAGIC MIRROR shines then glows green and reveals BELLE in her bedroom
talking to the WARDROBE)

WARDROBE (in mirror pleading) Why the masters not so bad once you get
to

know him Why dont you give him a chance
BELLE (still disturbed by the attack) I dont want to get to know
him

I dont want to have anything to do with him
BEAST (setting down MAGIC MIRROR speaking tenderly) Im just fooling
myself Shell never see me as anythingbut a monster
(Another
petal falls off the rose) Its hopeless
(BEAST puts his head in his hands as in a depressed state Fade outFade in
to
ext of BELLEs room Door creaks open BELLE silently emerges We see her
feet
go by as three bright spots shine through a curtain at floor level Behind
it
are LUMIERE and FEATHERDUSTER )

FEATHERDUSTER

Oh no
LUMIERE Oh yes
FEATHERDUSTER

Oh no

LUMIERE Oh yes yes yes
FEATHERDUSTER

(LUMIERE and FEATHERDUSTER have emerged and LUMIERE takes her in his arms
Suddenly he looks up and sees BELLE walking down the hall He drops

FEATHERDUSTER )
FEATHERDUSTER
Oof
LUMIERE Zut alors She has emerged
(Cut to kitchen where we find COGSWORTHMRS POTTSCHIP and the STOVE)
MRS POTTS Come on Chip Into the cupboard with your brothers and
sisters (helping him in)
CHIP But Im not sleepy

CHIP No Imnot (He falls asleep and MRS POTTS shuts the
cupboard
door)
(A banging of pots and pans comes from the STOVE)
STOVE I work and I slave all day and for what A culinary
masterpiece
gone to waste
MRS POTTS Oh stop your grousing Its been a long night for all of us
COGSWORTH Well if you ask me she was just being stubborn After all

MRS POTTS But if the master doesnt learn to control that temper hell

(BELLE enters and COGSWORTH cuts off MRS POTTS before she can say spell)

COGSWORTH (interrupting) Splendid to see you out and about mademoiselle
(LUMIERE comes running in) I am Cogsworth head of the
household (He leans over to kiss her hand but LUMIERE butts
in front of him) This is Lumiere

LUMIERE En chante cherie

COGSWORTH (trying to talk around LUMIERE who is still kissing BELLEs
hand) If theres anythingstop thatthat we canplease
(finally shoving him out of the way)to make your stay more
comfortable (LUMIERE burns the hand of COGSWORTH) Ow

BELLE I am a little hungry

MRS POTTS (excited to the other tea pots) You are Hear that Shes

hungry Stoke the fire break out the silver wake the china

(The fire on the STOVE roars to life and drawers open to reveal silverware

standing at attention)

COGSWORTH (secretively) Remember what the master said
MRS POTTS Oh pish tosh Im not going to let the poor child go hungry
COGSWORTH (thinking he is giving in to the ultimate demand) Oh all
right Glass of water crust of bread and then--
LUMIERE Cogsworth I am surprised at you Shes not our prisoner
Shes
our guest We must make her feel welcome here (to BELLE)
Right this way mademoiselle
COGSWORTH Well keep it down If the master finds out about this it will
be our necks
LUMIERE Of course of course But what is dinner without a little

music
(LUMIERE has started out the swinging door He lets it close
hits

and the door

COGSWORTH and sends him across the room to land in a pan filled with (what

looks
like) pancake batter He screams his line as he is in flight)
COGSWORTH MUSIC

(Cut to dining room where BELLE is seated at the end of a long table
LUMIERE

is on the table and a spotlight shines on him)

LUMIERE Ma chere mademoiselle It is with deepest pleasure and
greatest pride that I welcome you tonight And now we invite
you to relax Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly
presentsyour dinner

Be our guest be our guest

Put our service to the test

tie your napkin round your neck cherie

and we provide the rest
(The CHAIR has wrapped a napkin around the neck of BELLE who takes it off
and
places it on her lap The CHAIRs arms put its hands on its waist as if
it
were mad

Soup du jour hot hors doeuvres
Why we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff its delicious
Dont believe me Ask the dishes
(LUMIERE offers BELLE a plate of hors doeuvres She dips her finger in one
and tastes it)
They can sing they can dance
After all miss this is France
And a dinner here is never second best
Go on unfold your menu take a glance and then youll
Be our guest be our guest be our guest
(A cabinet at the end of the table opens to reveal a large CHINA collection
which rolls out and begins to perform LUMIERE hands BELLE a menu which she
begins to read)
Beef ragout cheese souffle
Pie and pudding en flambe
Well prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret
(Plates of food go dancing by with COGSWORTH in the pudding LUMIERE sets
his
torch to it and it explodes turning COGSWORTHs face black with soot)
Youre alone and youre scared
But the banquets all prepared
No ones gloomy or complaining
While the flatwares entertaining
(The FLATWARE enters a ‘Busby Berlkley-esque swimming scene)
We tell jokes I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks
(LUMIERE standing on a plate is elevated and begins to juggle his candles
MUGS enter the shot)
MUGS And its all in perfect taste
That you can bet
(The MUGS begin a gymnastics routine hopping over one another and passing a
beverage from one to the next)
ALL Come on and lift your glass
Youve won your own free pass
To be our guest be our guest be our guest
LUMIERE If youre stressed its fine dining we suggest

ALL Be our guest be our guest be our guest
(ALL leave except COGSWORTH who looks scared then begins to inch away
LUMIERE
enters and holds him there)
LUMIERE Life is so unnerving

For a servant whos not serving

Hes not whole without a soul to wait upon
COGSWORTH Get off
LUMIERE Ah those good old days when we were useful

Suddenly those good old days are gone
(LUMIERE sings as if he were reminiscing Snow begins to fall COGSWORTH
looks
up and sees the salt and pepper shakers doing their thing)
LUMIERE Ten years weve been rusting

Needing so much more than dusting

Needing exercise a chance to use our skills
(LUMIERE dusts the salt of the head of COGSWORTH who tries to escape He
trips
and falls into the gelatin mold)

Most days just lay around the castle

Flabby fat and lazy

You walked in and oops-a-daisie
(LUMIERE jumps on a spoon in the gelatin which catapults COGSWORTH out of
the
mold Cut to kitchen where MRS POTTS is surrounded by soap bubbles)
MRS POTTS Its a guest its a guest

Sakes alive well Ill be blessed

Wines been poured and thank the Lord

Ive had the napkins freshly pressed
(MRS POTTS continues to dance around the kitchen)

With dessert shell want tea

And my dear thats fine with me

While the cups do their soft shoeing

Ill be bubbling Ill be brewing

Ill get warm piping hot

Heavens sake is that a spot

Clean it up we want the company impressed

Weve got a lot to do--

Is it one lump or two

For you our guest
(MRS POTTS is cleaned off by a napkin She hops onto the tea cart and rolls
into the dining room where she offers tea to BELLE)

ALL Shes our guest
MRS POTTS Shes our guest
ALL Shes our guest

Be our guest Be our guest

Our command is your request

Its ten years since we had anybody here

(The CHINA and CANDLESTICKS perform an elaborately choreographed dance
sequence
ending in a cu of LUMIERE)

ALL (esp LUMIERE)

Course by course

One by one

Til you shout Enough Im done

Then well sing you off to sleep as you digest

Tonight youll prop your feet up

But for lets eat up

Be our guest Be our guest Be our guest Please Be our
guest
(A fantastic ending comes of the song with SILVERWARE flying through the
air
PLATES and FEATHERDUSTERS dancing and COGSWORTH the focus of attention
until
LUMIERE comes sliding in and sends him flying out of camera range)

BELLE Bravo That was wonderful
COGSWORTH Thank you thank you mademoiselle Yes good show wasnt it
everyone (Looking at his own face) Oh my goodness will you

look at the time Now its off to bed off to bed
(LUMIERE comes up next to COGSWORTH )

BELLE Oh I couldnt possibly go to bed now Its my first time in
an enchanted castle

COGSWORTH Enchanted Who said anything about the castle being enchanted
(He tries to cover it up just as a fork runs past To

LUMIERE)
It was you wasnt it

BELLE I um figured it out for myself (COGSWORTH and LUMIERE have

been
fighting They both look at her then stop COGSWORTH dusts
himself off and LUMIERE fixes his wax nose) Id like to look
around if thats all right

LUMIERE (excited) Oh Would you like a tour

COGSWORTH Wait a second wait a second Im not sure thats such a good

idea (Confidentially to LUMIERE) We cant let her go poking
around in certain places if you know what I mean

BELLE (Poking COGSWORTH in the belly (like the Pillsbury doughboy)
Perhaps you could take me Im sure you know everything there
is to know about the castle

COGSWORTH (flattered) Well actually ah yes I do

(Fade to COGSWORTH LUMIERE and BELLE walking down a hall with FOOTSTOOL

COGSWORTH is lecturing)

COGSWORTH As you can see the pseudo facade was stripped away to reveal a
minimalist rococo design Note the unusual inverted vaulted
ceilings This is yet another example of the neo-classic

baroque
period and as I always say if its not baroque dont fix it
Ha ha ha Now then where was I (He turns to find the heads of
the SUITS OF ARMOR have turned to follow BELLE) As you were
(They all snap back to face forward) Now if I may draw your
attention to the flying buttresses above the--mademoiselle

(COGSWORTH turns back to the group and is one girl short He sees her
beginning

to climb the grand staircase He and LUMIERE run up to her and jump in front
of

her blocking her progress upstairs)
BELLE Whats up there

COGSWORTH Where Up there Nothing Absolutely nothing of interest at
all
in the West Wing Dusty dull very boring

(LUMIERE has been shaking his head but COGSWORTH nudges him and he nods in

agreement)

BELLE Oh so thats the West Wing

LUMIERE (To COGSWORTH) Nice going

BELLE I wonder what hes hiding up there

LUMIERE Hiding The master is hiding nothing

BELLE Then it wouldnt be forbidden

(She steps over them but they dash up and block her again)

COGSWORTH Perhaps mademoiselle would like to see something else We have
exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to

BELLE (again stepping over them) Maybe later

LUMIERE (with COGSWORTH again dashing and blocking) The gardens or

the
library perhaps

BELLE (Now with incredible interest) You have a library

COGSWORTH (Thrilled that he has found something to interest her) Oh yes
Indeed

LUMIERE With books

COGSWORTH Gads of books

LUMIERE Mountains of books

COGSWORTH Forests of books

LUMIERE Cascades

COGSWORTH »-0f books

LUMIERE Swamps of books

COGSWORTH More books than youll ever be able to read in a lifetime

Books on every subject ever studied by every author who ever
set pen to paper

(LUMIERE and COGSWORTH begin marching off and BELLE begins to follow but
her

curiosity overtakes her and she turns back to the West Wing Her excitement
begins to dwindle though when she enters the hallway leading to BEASTs
lair

As she walks down the hall she stops to look in a mirror that has been
attered into several pieces each one reflecting her concerned look She
eaches the end of the hall and finds a closed door with gargoyle handles

e

akes a deep breath then reaches out and opens the door Cut to int of

air

ere BELLE begins to explore She is truly shocked by everything she sees
e wanders around looking and knocks over a table but she catches it

fore

crashes to the floor She then turns her head and sees a shredded picture

dato

e wall We can only see part of a portrait It is the same portrait that

EtOrRTNE HANK DA

o
ia)

shredded in the opening BELLE reaches out and lifts the shreds of the
picture

to reveal the prince We never see this however for then she turns her
head

and sees the rose under the bell jar She walks over to it her eyes
transfixed She reaches out then lifts off the jar leaving the rose
unprotected She reaches up brushes back the strand of hair that has been
repeatedly falling on her forehead then reaches out to touch the rose As
she

nears it a shadow falls over her BEAST has been on the balcony and sees
her

He jumps back into the roomthen slams the jar back on the rose He then
turns

his attention to BELLE)

BEAST (growing angry) Why did you come here

BELLE (Backing away scared) Im sorry

BEAST I warned you never to come here

BELLE I didnt mean any harm

BEAST (Angrier) Do you realize what you could have done (Begins to
thrash at the furniture)

BELLE (Pleading but still scared) Please stop No

BEAST (Screaming) Get out GET OUT

(BELLE turns and flees the room BEAST calms down then falls into despair
finally realizing that he may have destroyed his chances with BELLE She
reaches the stairway and grabs her cloak She rushes down the stairs
wrapping
the cloak around her and bursting past a confused LUMIERE and COGSWORTH )

LUMIERE Wh- Where are you going
BELLE Promise or no promise I cant stay here another minute
COGSWORTH Oh no wait please wait

(LUMIERE tries to respond but BELLE slams the door behind her He and
COGSWORTH both bow their heads in sadness Cut to BELLE outside in the
forest

on PHILLIPE She begins to ride through the forest but PHILLIPE comes to a
stop She looks up and sees the WOLVES She gasps then pulls the reins and
begins to flee She runs from side to side making the WOLVES hit the trees
(a
la Speederbike chase in Return of the Jedi) PHILLIPE runs out on a frozen
pond but his and BELLEs weight collapse the ice The WOLVES chase her into
the water Some begin to drown but PHILLIPE is able to get out of the water
before anything serious happens He runs into a clearing but becomes
surrounded by WOLVES He bucks throwing BELLE off and wrapping the reins
around a tree branch The WOLVES begin their attack on PHILLIPE but BELLE
comes to his rescue and beats them away with a stick One WOLF grabs the
stick

in its mouth and breaks half of it off leaving BELLE defenseless Another
leaps at her grabbing the corner of her cloak and dragging her to the
ground

She looks up and sees a WOLF about to jump on top of her It leaps and is
caught in mid-air by BEAST He throws the WOLF away then stands behind
them

and BELLE They lunge at each other One rips a hole in BEASTs shoulder
and

the others focus their attack on that spot Finally BEAST throws a WOLF
against a tree knocking it out The others turn and run in fear BEAST
turns

back to BELLE looks at her despairingly then collapses BELLE grateful to
be

alive turns back to PHILLIPE and begins to get on but her conscience takes
over and she walks over to the fallen BEAST Fade to BELLE and PHILLIPE
walking back to the castle with BEAST on the horses back Fade to int of
den

with BELLE pouring hot water out of MRS POTTS She soaks a rag in the
water

then turns to BEAST who is licking his wounds)

BELLE Here now Oh dont do that (BEAST growls at her as she tries
to

clean the wound with her rag) Justhold still

(She touches the rag to the wound and BEAST roars in pain The OBJECTS who
have been watching jump back into hiding from the outburst)

BEAST That hurts

BELLE (In counterpoint) If youd hold still it wouldnt hurt as
much
BEAST Well if you hadnt run away this wouldnt have happened
BELLE Well if you hadnt frightened me I wouldnt have run away
BEAST (Opens his mouth to respond but has to stop and think of a
good

line) Well you shouldnt have been in the West Wing
BELLE Well you should learn to control your temper (BEAST raises
his

hand to bring out another point but finds he has none so he
bows his head down again The OBJECTS emerge from their hiding

as BELLE has conquered the ferocious temper of BEAST BELLE
moves the rag closer to the wound) Now hold still This may
sting a little (BEAST gives a surprised grunt then grits his

teeth as the rag is applied BELLE speaks tenderly) By the
way

thank you for saving my life
(BEAST opens his eyes looking surprised)
BEAST (Also very tenderly) Youre welcome
(Camera zooms out and we see the OBJECTS looking on with interest Fade to
GASTONs tavern which is empty except for GASTON LEFOU and MONSIEUR
DARQUE
who are all sitting at a table)

DARQUE I dont usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night
but
they said youd make it worth my while (GASTON pulls out a
sack of gold and tosses it in front of him He takes out a
piece
scrapes it on his chin and continues) Aah Im listening
GASTON Its like this Ive got my heart set on marrying Belle but
she
needs a little persuasion
LEFOU (butting in) Turned him down flat
(GASTON slams a beer mug on his head)
GASTON Everyone knows her fathers a lunatic He was in here tonight
raving about a beast in a castle
DARQUE Maurice is harmless
GASTON The point is Belle would do anything to keep him from being
locked up
LEFOU Yeah even marry him

(GASTON gives him another threatening look and he ducks back under the mug)
DARQUE So you want me to throw her father in the asylum unless she
agrees
to marry you (They both nod in agreement) Oh that is
despicable I love it
(Cut to int of BELLEs cottage MAURICE is packing to leave)
MAURICE If no one will help me then Ill go back alone I dont care
what it takes Ill find that castle and somehow Ill get her
out of there

(MAURICE leaves on his journey Seconds later GASTON and LEFOU arrive with

Belle Maurice

Oh well I guess its not gonna work after all

They have to come back sometime and when they do well be

dont move from that spot until Belle and her father come home
But but aww nuts (He pounds the side of the house and a

of snow falls on his head)

looks at him questioningly) Its a surprise
her eyes and BEAST waves his hand in front of her Then he

the door He leads her in)

No no Not yet Wait here

spills into the room BELLE flinches reflexively as the light hits her

face)

I

would you look at that
a ha I knew it would work
at What works

ts very encouraging

Isnt this exciting
I didnt see anything
Come along Chip Theres chores to be done in the kitchen
CHIP But what are they talking about Whats going on
(OBJECTS walk away Fade to breakfast table with BELLE at one end and BEAST
at
the other with MRS POTTS between them BELLE is served breakfast and as
she
begins to eat she looks at BEAST gobbling up his food with no table manners
whatsoever CHIP laughs but MRS POTTS shoots him an admonishing look
BELLE
turns away and tries to ignore it but CHIP comes to the rescue He nudges
the
spoon with his nose and BEAST reaches out for it (very 3-D-ishly) BELLE
looks
at him in wonder as he tries to eat with the spoon but he has little
success
Finally BELLE puts down her spoon and lifts her bowl as if in a toast
BEAST
looks at the compromise and does the same They both begin to sip their
breakfast out of their bowls Fade to courtyard where BELLE and BEAST are
feeding the birds)
BELLE Theres something sweet

And almost kind

But he was mean

And he was coarse and unrefined

But now hes dear

And so unsure

I wonder why I didnt see it there before
(BELLE is trying to attract some birds to BEAST who shoves a handful of seed
at
them Finally she takes a handful and gently spreads it out creating a
trail
One lands in his hands and he looks up thrilled)

BEAST She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched
She didnt shudder at my paw

No it cant be
Ill just ignore
But then shes never looked at me that way before

(BELLE has ducked around a tree leaving BEAST with the birds She begins to
look doubtful again but turns her head around the tree and laughs BEAST is
covered with birds)

BELLE New and a bit alarming
Whod have ever thought that this could be
True that hes no Prince Charming
But theres something in him that I simply didnt see

(BELLE throws a snowball at BEAST who had looked at her proudly after the
birds

flew away He begins to gather a large pile of snow We cut to the OBJECTS
looking out of a window at the two In the background BELLE throws another
snowball at BEAST who drops his huge pile of snow on his head He chases
her
around a tree but she ducks around the other side and sneaks up on him from
behind)

LUMIERE Well whod have thought

MRS POTTS Well bless my soul

COGSWORTH And whod have known

MRS POTTS Well who indeed

LUMIERE And whod have guessed theyd come together on their own
MRS POTTS Its so peculiar

ALL Well wait and see

A few days more
There may be something there that wasnt there before

(Fade to den where BELLE sits in front of a roaring fire and reads to BEAST
OBJECTS inc CHIP watch from doorway)

COGSWORTH Yes perhaps theres something there that wasnt there before
CHIP What

MRS POTTS There may be something there that wasnt there before

CHIP Whats there mama

MRS POTTS Tll tell you when youre older
(Cut to int of BEASTs lair He is in the tub getting washed up for the big
night with BELLE LUMIERE is there with him)

LUMIERE Tonight is the night
BEAST (hesitantly) Im not sure I can do this
LUMIERE You dont have time to be timid You must be bold daring
BEAST Bold Daring (BEAST has emerged from the tub and shakes
himself

dry)
LUMIERE There will be music Romantic candlelight provided myself
and

when the time is right you confess your love
BEAST (Inspired) Yes I -- I con--No I cant
LUMIERE You care for the girl dont you
BEAST More than anything
LUMIERE Well then you must tell her (COATRACK has been cutting
BEASTs

hair It finishes and steps back) Voila You look soso
(Cut to shot of BEAST in pig-tails and bows)

BEAST Stupid
LUMIERE Not quite the word I was looking for Perhaps a little more
off
the top
(COATRACK begins to cut and chop again COGSWORTH enters)
COGSWORTH Ahem ahem ahem Your lady awaits

(Cut to grand staircase where BELLE descends from the West Wing side ina
glittering gold ball gown She reaches the landing and looks up at BEAST
who
is standing at the top of the stairs in his dress clothes He is nudged on
by
LUMIERE from behind the curtain and he descends and meets BELLE at the
landing
Arm in arm they descend the last section of stairs and continue on their way
to
dinner stopped momentarily by FOOTSTOOL MRS POTTS sings from her cart
with
CHIP on board)
MRS POTTS Tale as old as time

True as it can be

Barely even friends
Then somebody bends unexpectedly

Just a little change

Small to say the least

Both a little scared

Neither one prepared beauty and the beast

(BELLE and BEAST have moved into the ballroom where they move through a
computer perfect dance sequence BEAST occasionally looks over at LUMIERE
and

COGSWORTH for their approval MRS POTTS and CHIP are in the ballroom on
their

cart)

MRS POTTS Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bittersweet and strange
Finding you can change learning you were wrong

Certain as the sun

Rising in the east

Tale as old as time

Song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast

Tale as old as time

Song as old as rhyme beauty and the beast

(To CHIP) Off to the cupboard with you now Chip Its past
your bedtime Good night love

(CHIP slides off the end of the cart and hops out of the room but comes
back

for one last look BELLE and BEAST have adjourned to the balcony under a
starry

night)

BEAST Belle Are you happy here with me

BELLE (Hesitantly) Yes (She looks off into the distance)

BEAST What is it

BELLE (Looks at him desperately) If only I could see my father again
just for a moment I miss him so much

BEAST (Looks disappointed for a moment then excited) There is a

way

(The pair adjourn to BEASTs lair where BEAST hands BELLE the MAGIC MIRROR)
BEAST This mirror will show you anything anything you wish to see
BELLE (Hesitantly) Id like to see my father please

(The MAGIC MIRROR shines into life and BELLE turns her head away as it
flashes

Then it reveals MAURICE fallen in the woods coughing and lost BELLE is
shocked BEAST looks at her with concern)

BELLE Papa Oh no Hes sick he may be dying And hes all alone
(BEAST turns then looks at the rose deep in thought)
BEAST Thenthen you must go to him

BELLE What did you say

BEAST I release you You are no longer my prisoner

BELLE (In amazement) You meanIm free

BEAST Yes

BELLE Oh thank you (To MAGIC MIRROR) Hold on Papa Im on my
way

(BELLE turns to leave then turns back and pushes the MAGIC MIRROR back to
BEAST)

BEAST Take it with you so youll always have a way to look back and
remember me
BELLE Thank you for understanding how much he needs me

(BELLE turns to leave and BEAST looks down in depression She touches her
hand
to his cheek and rushes out We see BELLEs skirt fly past COGSWORTH who has
entered the room)

COGSWORTH Well your highness I must say everything is going just
peachy I knew you had it in you

BEAST (Very sad) I let her go

COGSWORTH Ha ha ha yes Splend-- (COGSWORTH stops in the middle of his
sentence) You what How could you do that

BEAST I had to

COGSWORTH (Still amazed) Yes but why

BEAST Because I love her

(Cut to COGSWORTH telling the rest of the OBJECTS about BEASTs decision)
ALL (ex COGSWORTH)
He did what

COGSWORTH Yes Im afraid its true

CHIP Shes going away

LUMIERE But he was so close

MRS POTTS After all this time hes finally learned to love
LUMIERE Thats it then That should break the spell

MRS POTTS But its not enough She has to love him in return
COGSWORTH And now its too late

(Cut to BEAST watching BELLE leave from above He roars in sorrow and anger
His roar turns into the sound of the wind BELLE is out in the snow calling
out Papa Finally she finds him face down in a snowbank They return
home
where LEFOU is still waiting disguised as a snowman)
LEFOU Oh theyre back
(Cut to black POV of MAURICE as his eyes open He sees BELLE)
MAURICE Belle

BELLE Its all right Papa Im home

MAURICE I thought Id never see you again

BELLE I missed you so much

MAURICE But the beast How did you escape

BELLE I didnt escape Papa He let me go

MAURICE That horrible beast

BELLE But hes different now Hes changed somehow

(There is sound coming from BELLEs pack The flap opens and the MAGIC
MIRROR
falls out with CHIP rolling to a stop on it)

CHIP Hi

BELLE Oh a stowaway

MAURICE Why hello there little fella Didnt think Id ever see you
again

(CHIP turns to BELLE with a look of question on his face)
CHIP Belle whyd you go away Dont you like us anymore

BELLE Oh Chip Of course I do Its just that--

(There is a knocking at the door BELLE opens it and MONSIEUR DARQUE stands
on

the porch)

BELLE May I help you

DARQUE Ive come to collect your father (He steps aside to show the
Asylum DLoons wagon behind him)

BELLE My father

DARQUE Dont worry mademoiselle Well take good care of him

BELLE My fathers not crazy

LEFOU (Emerging from the crowd) He was raving like a lunatic We all

MAURICE Belle

LEFOU Ah Maurice Tell us again old man just how big was the

LEFOU Well you dont get much crazier than that

MAURICE Its true I tell you

(DARQUE waves his arms and ORDERLIES move in and pick up MAURICE)
LEFOU Take him away

MAURICE Let go of me

(GASTON has been watching from the sides standing near DARQUE)

BELLE (To DARQUE) No you cant do this (DARQUE shakes her off

and
walks away)

GASTON Tsk tsk tsk Poor Belle Its a shame about your father

BELLE You know hes not crazy Gaston

GASTON I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding if

BELLE If what

GASTON If you marry me

BELLE What

GASTON One little word Belle Thats all it takes

BELLE Never

get)

MAURICE (Being thrown into the wagon) Belle (She runs back into the
house) Let go of me

BELLE (Comes back out with MAGIC MIRROR She yells to the crowd) My
fathers not crazy and I can prove it (To MIRROR) Show me the

beast (MAGIC MIRROR again shines then produces the image of
the still depressed BEAST The crowd oohs and aahs at it)

WOMAN 1 Is it dangerous

The beast will make off with your children

Hell come after them in the night

No

Were not safe til his head is mounted on my wall

I say we kill the beast

im and repeats the words kill him)

Were not safe until hes dead

Hell come stalking us at night

Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite
Hell wreak havoc on our village

If we let him wander free

So its time to take some action boys

Its time to follow me

s a torch into a haystack creating an instant bonfire He

und it warning of the dangers of the horrible BEAST)
Through the mist through the woods

Through the darkness and the shadows

Its a nightmare but its one exciting ride

Say a prayer then were there

At the drawbridge of a castle

And theres something truly terrible inside

s LEFOU around mimicking a monster)

Its a beast

Hes got fangs razor sharp ones

Massive paws

Killer claws for the feast

shows the face of BEAST to LEFOU which GASTON exaggerates

Hear him roar see him foam
But were not coming home
‘Til hes dead good and dead kill the beast

(Interjecting) No I wont let you do this

If youre not with us youre against us Bring the old man
Get your hands off me
s them into the basement and bolts the door)

We cant have them running off to warn the creature

Let us out
(To the CROWD) Well rid the village of this beast Whos with

I ams comes from the CROWD)

Light your torch mount your horse

Screw your courage to the sticking place

Were counting on Gaston to lead the way

Through a mist to a wood

Where within a haunted castle

Somethings lurking that you dont see every day

the MOB through the town and out into the forest where they

s in preparation for their assault on the castle)
Its a beast

One as tall as a mountain

We wont rest

‘Til hes good and deceased
Sally forth tally ho
Grab your sword grab your bow
Praise the Lord and here we go

GASTON Well lay siege to his castle and bring back his head

(Cut to int of basement where BELLE is prying at the window with a stick)
BELLE I have to warn the beast This is all my fault Oh Papa
What

are we going to do
MAURICE (Comforting her) Now now Well think of something
(We see CHIP looking in through the window He turns around thinking and
then
he sees MAURICEs contraption with the axe on the end of it)
MOB We dont like what we dont
Understand it frankly scares us
And this monster is mysterious at least

Bring your guns bring your knives

Save your children and your wives

Well save our village and our lives

Well kill the beast
COGSWORTH I knew it I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up
LUMIERE Maybe it would have been better if she had never come at all
(FOOTSTOOL comes in barking They rush over to the window expecting the
return

of BELLE)

LUMIERE Could it be

MRS POTTS Is it she

LUMIERE (Realizing the MOB is not BELLE) Sacre bleu invaders

COGSWORTH Encroachers

MRS POTTS (Seeing GASTON) And they have the mirror

COGSWORTH (Issuing orders) Warn the master If its a fight they want
well be ready for them (Turns around from window) Whos with
me Aahh (The door is slammed as the rest of the OBJECTS

leave
COGSWORTH behind)

GASTON Take whatever booty you can find but remember the beast is

mine

(Cut to stairway where OBJECTS are marching down to do battle with the MOB)

OBJECTS Hearts ablaze banners high

We go marching into battle

Unafraid although the danger just increased
MOB Raise the flag sing the song

Here we come were fifty strong

And fifty Frenchmen cant be wrong

Lets kill the beast
(Cut to int of BEASTs lair where MRS POTTS is briefing him)

MRS POTTS Pardon me master

BEAST Leave me in peace

MRS POTTS But sir the castle is under attack
MOB Kill the beast kill the beast

(The OBJECTS have tried to block off the door but it is being bashed in by
the
MOB)
LUMIERE This isnt working
FEATHERDUSTER
Oh Lumiere We must do something
LUMIERE Wait I know

MOB Kill the beast kill the beast

(Cut to BEASTs lair)

MRS POTTS What shall we do master

BEAST (Still very sad) It doesnt matter now Just let them come
MOB Kill the beast kill the beast kill the beast

(The MOB succeeds in breaking in and finds a grand entrance filled with
assorted pieces of furniture teacups candlesticks featherdusters and
clocks

They tiptoe in and LEFOU unknowingly picks up LUMIERE )

LUMIERE Now

(All the objects spring into life attacking their human enemies Cut back
to

BELLEs home where CHIP has readied the invention)

CHIP Yes Here we go
(MAURICE looks out from the window and sees the advancing axe)
MAURICE What the devil Belle look out

(The invention crashes into the door and a red cloud of smoke poofs out of
the

basement BELLE and MAURICE emerge from the wreckage to find CHIP swinging
on

a

loose spring)

CHIP You guys gotta try this thing

(Cut back to the castle where the attack continues Meanwhile GASTON has
broken off from the mob and is searching out BEAST BELLE MAURICE
PHILLIPE
and CHIP are making their way to the castle Finally the invaders are chased
out and the objects celebrate their victory)

COGSWORTH And stay out
(LUMIERE pulls over COGSWORTH and kisses him once on each cheek COGSWORTH
shakes it off Cut to GASTON who finds BEASTs lair He raises his crossbow
and takes aim BEAST looks up at him then looks back down in sadness again
GASTON releases the arrow and it strikes BEAST in the shoulder He screams
in
pain and stands GASTON rushes him and they fly out the window onto the
balcony where it has begun to rain)

GASTON Ha ha ha ha ha

(GASTON corners BEAST on the edge of the roof BEAST simply sits there in
despair)

GASTON Get up Get up Whats the matter Beast Too kind and gentle
to

fight back
(BEAST looks down ignoring him GASTON walks into the foreground and breaks
off
a piece of the roof He is about to smash it on BEASTs head when BELLEs
voice
drifts up She is on the bridge and is yelling to GASTON telling him to

stop)

BELLE No

BEAST (Hearing her voice and giving him new life) Belle
BELLE Gaston dont

(GASTON swings down at BEAST but he catches the weapon in his hand BEAST
rises up and roars in GASTONs face They proceed through a fight on the
rooftop Finally BEAST takes a hiding place among the gargoyles in the
darkness Meanwhile BELLE enters the castle on the ground)

BELLE Lets go Phillipe
GASTON Come on out and fight Were you in love with her beast Did
you

honestly think shed want you when she had someone like me
(BEAST has been provoked enough He emerges and they fight again)
GASTON Its over beast Belle is mine
(This time however BEAST picks up GASTON by the neck and holds him out over
the edge of the roof GASTON pleads with BEAST)
GASTON Put me down Put me down Please dont hurt me Ill do

anything Anything
(BEASTs anger slowly melts off his face and the look of compassion returns
He pulls GASTON back onto the roof)
BEAST Get out
(He shoves GASTON to the ground Above BELLE comes out on a balcony)
BELLE Beast
BEAST Belle
(BEAST begins to climb the tower (very much like King Kong) until he reaches
the
balcony He hangs over the side)
BEAST Belle You came back
(BEAST and BELLE stare passionately at each other but the moment is
interrupted
when GASTON sneaks up and stabs BEAST in the back BEAST roars in pain and
BELLE is helpless GASTON pulls the knife out and swings back for another
shot
BEAST starts to fall knocking GASTON off his balance BELLE reaches forward
and pulls BEAST back while GASTON falls off never to be seen again BELLE
h
t

e injured BEAST up onto the balcony where he lies down on the floor The
OBJECTS come rushing out but stay out of sight)

BEAST You came back

BELLE Of course I came back I couldnt let themOh this is all my
fault If only Id gotten here sooner

BEAST Maybe its better this way

BELLE Dont talk like that Youll be all right Were together

now

Everythings going to be fine Youll see
BEAST At least I got to see you one lasttime
(BELLE pulls BEASTs paw up to her cheek He holds it there for a second
then
drops it His head falls back and his eyes close BELLE drops the paw and
puts
her hands to her mouth She cant believe this has happened)
BELLE (Crying) No no Please Please Please dont leave me I
love

you
(Cut to OBJECTS who watch the last petal fall off the rose They all look
down
at the floor and COGSWORTH puts his arm around MRS POTTS Cut back to BELLE
and BEAST The rain continues to fall But one beam of light falls like a
shooting star Then another comes And another and another BELLE finally
notices what is happening She stops crying for a second then starts to
back
away We cut A fog begins to enshroud BEAST We see the OBJECTS looking on
in
extreme anticipation BEAST rises up into the air magically and begins to
turn
He is enveloped in a cloud of light and becomes wrapped in his cloak
Underneath we can see BEASTs body shifting and forming A fore paw comes
out

and the claws turn into fingers A hind paw emerges and develops into a
foot

Finally a wind blows across his face and the fur melts away to reveal a
young

prince He gradually descends and is laid on the floor again The fog
disappears and BELLE reaches out to touch him She jerks her hand back
however when the figure begins to move It stands then looks at its hands
then turns to face BELLE It is a human with the same blue eyes as BEAST
It

is obviously BEAST transformed BELLE gives him a mysterious look)

PRINCE Belle Its me

(She continues to look at him skepticallybut then she sees the blue eyes
and

instantly knows it is him)

BELLE It is you

(They kiss A fireworks display explodes around them The gloom surrounding
the castle disappears revealing a blue sky The castle is transformed with
the gargoyles changing into cherubs Finally we return to the balcony
where

the OBJECTS hop out to meet the PRINCE and BELLE One by one they are
transformed back to their original human conditions)

PRINCE Lumiere Cogsworth Oh Mrs Potts Look at us

(CHIP comes riding in on FOOTSTOOL)

CHIP Mama Mama (The pair transforms back into a boy and dog)
MRS POTTS (Picking up her boy) Oh my goodness

LUMIERE It is a miracle

(The PRINCE picks up BELLE and swings her around The ruffles of her skirt
wipe

to the ballroom where all are gathered to celebrate The PRINCE and BELLE
dance around the room as the rest of the characters get in their last lines)

LUMIERE Ah lamour (He says this and a maid obviously the former
FEATHERDUSTER walks by brushing him on the chin) Heh heh
(He
starts to chase after her but COGSWORTH stops him)
COGSWORTH Well Lumiere old friend Shall we let bygones be bygones
LUMIERE Of course mon ami I told you she would break the spell
COGSWORTH I beg your pardon old friend but I believe I told you
LUMIERE No you didnt I told you
COGSWORTH You most certainly did not you pompous parrafin-headed
pea-brain
LUMIERE En garde you overgrown pocket watch (He takes off his glove
and

slaps COGSWORTH across the face with it They begin to fight
Cut to BELLE and the PRINCE who continue to dance around the
floor The camera stops on MRS POTTS CHIP and MAURICE who
is beginning to cry)

CHIP Are they gonna live happily ever after mama
MRS POTTS Of course my dear Of course
CHIP (Looks happy for a moment then puzzled) Do I still have to

sleep in the cupboard
(MAURICE laughs and MRS POTTS hugs her child and laughs Cut to a camera
looking over the entire ballroom with all in the shot It slowly zooms out
with
BELLE and the PRINCE dancing around the room and fades into the final
stained
glass window this one with BELLE and the PRINCE in the center
the rest of the characters)
CHORUS Certain as the sun

Rising in the east

Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme

Beauty and the beast

Tale as old as time song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
