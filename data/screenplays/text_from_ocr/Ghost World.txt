an

elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction
devices

SPEAKER

High school is like the training
wheels for the bicycle of real life
It is a time for young people to
explore different fields of interest
and to hopefully grow from their
experiences After all that which
we learn from our mistakes can be as
valuable as what we learn from our
textbooks and often we can turn the
negative experiences that are common
to all high-schoolers into positive
steps toward personal growth and
achievement In coming to terms with
my own personal setback which Im
sure youve all heard about Ive
been able to learn a lot about myself
Ive learned for one thing that I
dont need to rely on drugs and
alcohol

(APPLAUSE)
and that Im very lucky-that more
people besides Carrie and myself
werent hurt in the accident Ive
learned that Im blessed with
wonderful parents teachers and above
all the best classmates in the world --
I love each and every one of you

from TV)

REBECCA

classic piece of vintage taxidermy
Nobody alive today knows how to do
work like that

ENID
(looking underneath
it)
How much is this

JOE
Umm Thats not officially for

Joe shuts off the TV He turns to the girls not

lose the rapport hes established with two potential
customers
childs

name

laughter

JOE
So are you looking for anything in
particular Theres a lot of other
stuff in storage

He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitarkeyboard (a
toy) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks

JOE
Perhaps the Jam-in-ator appeals to
you Absolutely no practice
necessary You shread like a giant
Just press a button

ENID
Thats okay

She notices several modern jazz LPs on Joes table

ENID
Do you have any other old records
besides these

JOE
Seymour does

ENID
Who does

JOE
Him Seymour Hes the man with the
records

Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible

Seymour Rebecca snorts unable to control her

and turns away from the table Enid keeps her cool

ENID
Do you have any old Indian records

SEYMOUR
Indian records

ENID
You know like weird 1960s Indian
rock n roll music

SEYMOUR
I dont have anything after about
1935 I may have one Hindu 78 from
the twenties in my collection but
its not really for sale I dont
really collect foreign

Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of
78s

SEYMOUR
Those are all 78s Can you play
78s

ENID
Sure Wait maybe not 78s but I
can play regular records

He points her to a nearby box of LPs

SEYMOUR
Theres some good stuff in here
do you like old music

ENID
Sure I guess

SEYMOUR
Well theres a few choice LPs in
here that re-issue some really great
old blues stuff

Rebecca tugs on Enids sleeve Enid gets free and
continues

looking through the records She stops on one with an

especially wacky cover

ENID
Is this one any good

SEYMOUR
Nah its not so great Heres the
one Id recommend

He pulls out a bland-looking record COLLECTORS
ITEMS
VOLUME THREE Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her

SEYMOUR
This track alone by Memphis Minnie
is worth about 500 if you have the
original 78 She was one of the
greatest guitar players that ever
lived and a great singer and
songwriter as well I know the guy
who owns the original and lent it
for use on this reissue

ENID
Wow

Rebecca snorts at Enids over-exuberance Enid kicks
her

ENID
How much is it

SEYMOUR
A dollar seventy-five

ENID
Okay

She pays him

SEYMOUR
If you dont like it bring it back
for a refund Were here every
Saturday

He puts the record into a bag

ENID
Im sure its fine

INT QUALITY CAFE - DAY

Enid and Rebecca sit in their usual booth Rebecca is
reading
THE FREE WEEKLY

REBECCA
That was truly pathetic

ENID
I know I still cant get over
that his name was Seymour

Rebecca starts looking through the APARTMENT LISTINGS
She
takes a pen out of her purse

REBECCA
He was so excited when you bought
that record -- youre a saint
God these apartments are super
expensive

ENID
It was so cute how he had his own
little bags I thought I was going
to start crying Do you think
theyre gay

REBECCA
What about the striking redhead in
the yellow dress

ENID
Oh yeah

REBECCA

He should totally just kill himself
Hey heres one

(circles it)
Oh wait

(crosses it out)
you have to share it with a non
smoking feminist and her two cats

ENID
I dunno I kind of like him
Hes the exact opposite of everything
I really hate In a way hes such
a clueless dork that hes almost
cool

REBECCA
That guy is many things but he
definitely isnt cool This one
would be okay but theres no
kitchen

ENID
Yeah but you know what I mean

REBECCA
Not really

ENID

Forget it I cant explain it
Awkward silence Melorra enters
MELORRA

Melorra leaves quickly

REBECCA
Funky

ENID
What is she black now

They watch her cross the street - shes dressed in
expensive
casual clothes with a fancy backpack
REBECCA
Ive been thinking about when we
look for our apartment how we have
to try and convince people that were
like these totally rich yuppies

ENID
What are you talking about

REBECCA
Thats who people want to rent to
Its a known fact that its way easier
to get a job and everything if youre
rich All we have to do is buy a
few semi-expensive outfits and act
like its no big deal itll be
fun

ENID
You just want an excuse to dress
like some stupid fashion model without
me making fun of you

REBECCA
Just promise youll do it

ENID
Okay okay I promise Jesus youre
out of your mind

INT ENIDS BATHROOM - DAY

Loud water running PUNK ROCK blares from adjoining

the

bedroom

INT ENIDS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

STORE in
a distinctive old building that looks as if its been
there

forever They stop and peer through the window

ENID
We still have to go in there sometime

REBECCA
Its always closed

ENID
I bet they have tons of incredible
shoes hidden in the back

They continue walking
ENID
Hey look its the pants

We see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk

REBECCA
Where are we going

ENID
Lets go hassle Josh

REBECCA
Hassle

They see a MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in a shabby

threadbare
suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop The
rusty
sign has a red sticker on it that says No longer in
service
REBECCA
There he is
ENID
As always
REBECCA
Waiting for the bus that never
comes
ENID
I wonder if hes just totally insane
and he really thinks a bus is coming
or --
REBECCA
Why dont you ask him
Enid sits next to THE MAN Rebecca stands behind the
bench
taken aback that Enid is going to end the long standing
speculation
ENID
Hi whats your name

wrist then down the
street)
Norman

ENID

He exits Rebecca walks over to Enid

INT ENIDS BEDROOMBATHROOM - EVENING

Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the
bathroom

She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the
right box

(black hair dye) She wets her hair then goes into the

bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box The
punk

rock song we heard earlier plays She yanks out the
tape and

flings it away She skims through her records and CDs

dismissing them all She notices Seymours bag in the
corner

She takes out the record and puts it on The first tune
is

an upbeat instrumental number She returns to the
bathroom

Several minutes pass TRACK TWO begins on the LP She
(and

we) slowly begin to take notice Its a strange
haunting

old BLUES RECORD We see that the tune has struck a
nerve

INT ENIDS BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

The song continues Enid sits in her bean-bag chair
Her

hair is now dyed back to black As the song ends she
picks

up the needle and starts it again

INT SEYMOUR and JOES GARAGE SALE - DAY
ENID
Yeah it took a while before I got a
chance to play it but when I heard
that song it was like --

SEYMOUR
So you really liked it Yeah theres
some really rare performances You
liked that Memphis Minnie huh

ENID
Yeah thats good too the whole
record was good but that one song
Devil Got My Woman -- I mostly
just keep playing that one over and
over Do you have any other records
like that

SEYMOUR

The Skip James record Yeah thats
a masterpiece There are no other
records like that I actually have
the original 78 of it in my
collection Its one of maybe five
known copies

ENID
(nearly sincere)
Wow

SEYMOUR
Do you want to see it I can run
upstairs and get it

ENID
Yeah sure I guess

SEYMOUR
(to Joe he always
says this when he
leaves his table)
Watch my stuff

Seymour exits An uncomfortable pause as Enid stands at
the
table She touches the mongooses tooth

JOE
(not looking up)

You still interested in that

ENID
holds it

school
traced

table

I thought it wasnt for sale

JOE
Im thinkin maybe I could let it
go

ENID

Its kind of falling apart

Seymour returns with the 78 holding it like a precious
object

SEYMOUR
Here it is Its only about V minus
and has an incipient lam crack but
plays decent as I recall
Seymour passes the 78 to Enid who follows suit and

carefully by the edges

ENID
Wow

Enid pretends to drop the record

ENID
Oops I dropped it

SEYMOUR
NO

ENID
Hey I was only kidding

She hands the record back to Seymour whos shaken and
embarrassed

ENID
Jesus Seymour are you all right

INT ART CLASS - DAY

Starts with a PAN ACROSS a wall of unimpressive high
art dumb drawings of fighting Chuck Norris-types
centerfolds highly sexualized horses etc And ona
a wire sculpture made from two coathangers

ROBERTA
Im not going to start a discourse
on the subject of good art vs
bad art these judgments are for
each person to make on his own I
merely want to help each of you find
the best way to look within yourselves
the best key to your particular lock
Last week I asked you to-try and
create a piece of artwork that
responds to something that you have
strong feelings about

Enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table

ROBERTA
And it looks like we have some really
interesting work up here

Roberta peruses some of the art then points to a very
violent
drawing

ROBERTA
What can you tell us about your
piece uh
(struggles to read
signature)
Phillip

PHILLIP
(very stupid and
nervous)
Uh its uh its about The
Mutilator

ROBERTA
My goodness

PHILLIP
Its this really great video game
about a guy who kills people with a
big hammer

ROBERTA
(trying to make a
joke)
I thought maybe this was supposed to
be your father

No response from Phillip Roberta nicks up Enids
sketchbook
and leafs through it
ROBERTA
And what can you tell us about this
(searches for name)

ENID
Enid Its sort of like a diary I
guess

We see several sketches including the drawing of the
SATANISTS Roberta shows a few pages to the class

ROBERTA

I think that Phillip and Enid can
help us to see that there are-many
different ways we can express
ourselves We can do things like
these cartoons that are amusing as a
sort of light entertainment or we
can do work that is more serious in
scope and feeling and that deals
with issues emotional spiritual
political of great importance I
hope that you will each have the
tools to do that type of work by the
end of this class

(pause points at

WIRE SCULPTURE)
Who is responsible for this

MARGARET
I am

ROBERTA
Talk to us about it

MARGARET
Its my response to the issue of a
womans right to choose its

something I feel super-strongly about

ROBERTA
Isnt this a wonderful piece class
This definitely falls into that higher
category of art I was speaking of
earlier

MARGARET glances over at Enid Enid gives her a dirty
look

RECORD
COLLECTORS mill about

JEROME
There are some records I will pay
serious money for provided theyre
a sincere V plus Other than that
Id prefer to just have them on CD

STEVEN
CDs will never have the presence of
an original 78

JEROME
WRR-ONG A digital transfer adequately
mastered will sound identical to the
original Do you have a decent
equalizer

STEVEN
I have a Klipsch 2B3

JEROME
Obviously the problem You expect a
ten-band equalizer to impart state
of-the-art sound Dream a little
dream etc

Enid and Rebecca are sitting nearby

REBECCA
I totally totally hate you

ENID
Aw cmon this is a fun party
ANGLE ON Joe stands talking to GERROLD an obnoxious
pushy

fast-talking guy who keeps eyeing Rebecca He shovels
food

into his mouth as he speaks

cheerleaders over here

to PAUL - a humorless middle-aged guy in a suit and
tie

whos contemptuously examining one of Seymours 78s

SEYMOUR
but it plays like new Theres no
groove wear

PAUL
Oh please It has an enlarged center
hole and a hair crack

Enid approaches them

SEYMOUR
But the crack is so tight its
completely inaudible

PAUL
A tight hair crack is just that - a
crack I dont collect cracked
records
(walking away)
I only pay a premium for mint records
Seymour you know that Please

ENID
What was all that stuff about enlarged
holes and tight cracks

SEYMOUR
I I didnt think you would have
any interest in this get together
containers

about

EXT CITY STREET - DAY

As Enid and Seymour walk A 20-ish secretary-type
passes

ENID
What about her Would you go out

SEYMOUR

irrelevant because a girl like that
would never be caught dead with me

ENID
But putting that aside for now would

SEYMOUR
I really didnt get a good look at
her

A breasty overweight 40-year-old walks by

Enid and her dad are eating breakfast A 13 TV sits on

wetlands it comes in the form of a
sanctuary provided by people who

Thats why at Chevron were just as
concerned

DAD
Are you still looking for a job Do

ENID
Look I told you Im not going to
college

DAD

Well I think its good to keep all
your options open You can always
enroll for the winter quarter You

city college part time and still
get a job if you wanted to

INT COLLEGE COFFEE HOUSE DAY

Enid and Rebecca sit in a semi-crowded college hang-

out
REBECCA
you dont have to make a million
dollars -- just get any stupid job

so we can at least start looking for
an apartment

ENID

(thoughtful pause)
I wonder if I hang around with you
because youre like my surrogate
mother figure or something Like I
have this subconscious biological
need to be nagged and bitched at
constantly

REBECCA
You hang out with me because nobody
else can stand to be around you

ENID
Or maybe did you ever think that
deep down we really might be lesbos
Maybe thats why we spend so much
time together

REBECCA
Youre gross
(pause)
See that guy

ENID
Which one

REBECCA
He gives me a total boner

ENID
Hes like the biggest idiot of all
time

The guy a COLLEGE SOPHOMORE walks by them with two

INT ENIDS FANTASY - EVENING

Starts on full moon in night sky framed right --

a dark moonlit room Enid lies on her stomach in
MOVE IN CLOSER to her head as though entering her
which slowly fade in WE MOVE TOWARD a vertical sliver
light -- a cracked-open bathroom door

WE MOVE into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower

enters dressed in a black suit holding a large
flowers CUT We start again exactly as before only
the flowers He starts to take off his clothes CUT He

again and gets right in the shower fully clothed

They begin to kiss After a passionate moment the door
Rebecca stands there stunned
CUT BACK TO

We see only the slightest trace of Enid in the
sighs
INT ART CLASS - DAY
CLOSE-UP ON a charcoal portrait of DON KNOTTS

Who is this Enid

ENID
Its supposed to be Don Knotts

ROBERTA
And what was your reason for choosing
him as your subject

ENID
I dunno I just like Don Knotts
ROBERTA
I see interesting
She moves on
ROBERTA

What do we have here Margaret

MARGARET
ts a tampon in a teacup

Class GIGGLES

ROBERTA
can see that now what can you
tell us about it First of all what
ind of sculpture is this

MARGARET
ts a found object thats when
an artist takes an ordinary object
and places it in an artistic context
and thus it becomes art

ROBERTA
Very good Now what can you tell us
about it in regard to your artistic
intent

MARGARET
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol
for womanhood because of tea parties
in the olden days but instead of
an

tea I was trying to kind of confront
people with this like

ROBERTA
This shocking image of repressed
femininity

MARGARET
Right exactly

ROBERTA
I think its really a wonderful piece
Margaret

Enid gives Margaret another dirty look

ROBERTA
This illustrates perfectly what I
was saying about not being afraid to
use controversial imagery class

EXT SEYMOURS CAR - DUSK

piercing and loud - its like someone
jabbing me in the face

DJ voice)
KFTO comin atchya on this beautiful
evening

She changes the subject and holds up a 78 record

ENID
So why did you bring this along

SEYMOUR
I brought it for him to autograph
Hes going to be amazed to see it -

opening act and not the headliner
What an insult

ENID

Hes
good but hes being politely ignored for the most part
by
the TWENTY-SOMETHING PATRONS Most of them are more

sports game until hes done playing

if to say

SEYMOUR
Yes that would certainly do

ENID
Well offer her a seat You want me
to do it

SEYMOUR

GIRL who 1

Seymour a

ooks back at Seymour and smiles She goes to

walks off in the direction of the bar
thumbs up

CUTE GIRL
Hi

SEYMOUR
Hello Uh that was great music
huh

CUTE GIRL

(sitting down)
Yeah I just love blues

SEYMOUR
Actually technically what he was
mostly playing would more accurately

giving
be classified in the ragtime idiom
Although of course not in the
strictest sense of the more classical
ragtime piano music like that of

Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb Authentic
Blues has a more conventional twelve-
bar structure in its stanzas

CUTE GIRL
Oh if you like authentic blues youve
just gotta see Blueshammer Theyre
so great

ANGLE ON Enid standing alone at the bar We see
Seymour and
Cute Girl from her POV Her gaze drifts to the other

people
in the bar WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and
stop
on a skinny introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue
He
makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious
cue
twirling routine Her gaze drifts on
She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes
off
her hat reconfiguring her hair She reaches into her
purse
and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses This is
interrupted
by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage Young white cocky
pretty
boys
LANCE
(LEAD SINGER)
All right people Are you ready to
BOOGIE Cuz we gwine play you some
authentic way-down-in-the-delta
blues to rock your world One Two

A din of loud noise CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her
feet
boogeying to the music
Several horny ALPHA MALES press in on Seymour (whos
still

sitting) spilling his drink as they vie to dance with
her
Seymour extricates himself from the table and walks
toward
the bar where Enid sits

SEYMOUR
What did you tell that girl

ENID
I told her you were a big record
executive and you were thinking of
signing that band to your label

SEYMOUR
Jesus

INT SEYMOURS CAR - NIGHT

SEYMOUR
Now I remember why I havent gone
anywhere in months Im not even in
the same universe as those creatures
back there I might as well be from
another planet

ENID
We just need to figure out a place
where you can meet somebody who isnt
a total idiot thats all

SEYMOUR
Look I really appreciate your help
Enid but lets face it this is
hopeless

ENID
Its not hopeless

SEYMOUR
Yeah well its simple for everybody
else - give em a Big Mac and a pair
of Nikes and theyre happy I just
cant relate to 999 of humanity

ENID
Yeah well I cant relate to humanity
either but I dont think its totally

hopeless

SEYMOUR
But its not totally hopeless for
you Ive had it I dont even

have the energy to try anymore You
should make sure you do the exact
opposite of everything I do so you
dont end up like me

ENID
Id rather end up like you than those
people at that stupid bar At

least youre an interesting person
at least youre not exactly like
everybody else

SEYMOUR
Hooray for me

INT SEYMOURS APT - NIGHT

Enid walks in behind Seymour

SEYMOUR
Im not sure I have anything to
drink there might be some --
ENID
It doesnt matter Im not staying
long I just want to make sure I

convince you not to give up yet

SEYMOUR
yet

INT SEYMOURS BEDROOM - NIGHT

They both have drinks now He puts on a jazz record an
instrumental

ENID
(picks up an antique
knick knack)
Wow this is so cool

SEYMOUR
If you dont mind my asking -- why
do you care so much if I get a date
or not

ENID
I dunno because I cant stand the
idea of a world where a guy like you
cant get a date

Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff
against the
stereotype

smile

Chicken

then

Cooks

90s

labels

wall in the corner Its an old-fashioned cartoony

of a black mans head with big lips and a huge toothy

ENID
What the fuck Seymour What is
this

SEYMOUR
What Oh that I borrowed that

from work about fifteen years ago
I guess its mine now

ENID
What are you a klansman or something

SEYMOUR
Yeah right Im a klansman - thanks
a lot Do you know the Cooks

Chicken franchise

ENID
(quoting TV commercial
in deep voice)
Four-piece Cooks special deep fried
with side n slaw its OUT RAY-GEOUS

SEYMOUR
Yeah well Cooks is just a made
up name When they originally opened
back in 1922 they were named The
Coon Chicken Inn -- thats an early
painting of their first logo
He takes out a scrapbook

SEYMOUR
Im obsessed with all this stuff -
this lost culture of the 20th century
She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon
logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man

into an older distinguished black chef with the logo

Chicken Inn Then to a white version of the same chef
followed by a female white chef then to a streamlined

version On another page is a collection of cosmetic
tracing the design evolution of a different company

ENID
Why doesnt everybody know this

The record ends Seymour gets up to take it off the
turntable

SEYMOUR
(somewhat bitterly)
Its ancient history The same reason
nobody knows about this Lionel Belasco
record

He puts on another record

SEYMOUR
Actually I was a whole lot more
interested in the Cooks phenomenon
when I was about your age Ive kind
of lost interest since Ive been
working for them

ENID
You work at Cooks Chicken

SEYMOUR
For nineteen years

ENID
What are you a fry cook or something

SEYMOUR
Nothing so glamorous actually
Im an assistant manager at their
corporate headquarters

ENID
Jesus Id go nuts if I had to work
in an office all day

SEYMOUR
Hey I get good benefits a good
early retirement plan nobody ever
bothers me

ENID
Yeah but still

SEYMOUR
I make enough money to eat and buy
old records what more do I want
by

Enid puts down the scrapbook stares at the painting

ENID
So I dont really get it -- are you
saying that things were better back

then
(points at painting)
even though there was stuff like

this

SEYMOUR
No in a lot of ways things are better
now I dunno its complicated

Everybody still hates each other
but they know how to hide it better
or something

ENID
(suddenly)
Hey can I borrow this

SEYMOUR
What Why

ENID
I promise Ill take good care of it

SEYMOUR
I dunno theyre very sensitive at
work about all this stuff Maybe it
would be better if you --

ENID
Dont you trust me Seymour

INT ART CLASS - DAY
We see another wall of student art dominated this time
Enids (Seymours) 3 x 4 painting

ROBERTA
Lets address some discussion to
this piece

SNOTTY GIRL
I dont like it

ROBERTA
Can you tell us why
More kids

SNOTTY GIRL
I dont know

HIPPY-ISH BOY
I think its totally weak

BLACK GIRL
Yeah its not right

respond at once Even Margaret is confused

ROBERTA
These are all valid comments but I
think we should see if the artist
has anything to bring to this

ENID
Well I got the idea when I was doing
some research and I discovered that
Cooks Chicken used to be called
Coons Chicken and so I decided to
do my project based on this discovery
as kind of a comment on racism
and the way racism is whitewashed
over in our culture

ROBERTA
Did you actually do this painting

ENID
Well no - its more like a found
art object

ROBERTA

And how do you think this addresses
the subject of racism

ENID
Its complicated I guess Im trying
to show how racism used to -- more

out in the open and now its hidden
or something

ROBERTA
And how does an image like this help
us to see that

ENID
Im not sure I mean
(thinks)
I guess because when we see something
like this it seems really shocking
and we have to figure out why its
so shocking

A long pause as Roberta and the class stare at the
painting

ROBERTA
I dont really know what to say
Enid
(another over-long
pause)
Its a remarkable achievement

INT REBECCAS ROOM - EVENING

Enid is lying on her back with her head on Rebeccas
stomach

Both stare blankly at the ceiling

REBECCA
Are you kidding Its a dream job
I cant believe you got a job like
that without even trying God I
wish that was my job

ENID
(trying to generate
some enthusiasm)
Yeah maybe itll be okay At least
Ill get to see every movie for free
I guess I had to lie and tell
them I already graduated

REBECCA
When are you finally going to get
your diploma

ENID
I dunno but next week is my last
class

REBECCA

Anyway now we can start looking for
the apartment

(waits for some

response from Enid

but there is none)
Do you remember when we first came
up with that whole idea of renting
our own apartment
ENID
Wasnt it like eighth grade

REBECCA
Seventh you wanted to move out
right then

ENID

That must have been when my dad was
married to Maxine

REBECCA
I remember our big plan was as soon
as we got the apartment we were going
to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming
over and then fuck him

ENID
We were such desperate sluts back
then

INT PACIFIC THEATER - AFTERNOON

Enid is behind the candy counter dressed in a brown and
orange
uniform

MANAGER
Im gonna let you handle the four
thirty crowd by yourself - that way
I can evaluate your performance while
its slow and ease you into the bigger
crowds

ENID
You can count on me sir

A customer an ALCOHOLIC LOSER approaches the candy
counter

LOSER
Do you serve beer or any alcohol

ENID
I wish actually you wish after
about five minutes of this movie
youll wish to God you had about ten
beers

LOSER stares blankly hesitates then goes into
theater
MANAGER
(pulling her aside)
What are you doing You dont ever
criticize the feature

ENID
Why What difference does it make
You already got his money

MANAGER
Look thats the policy if you
want to make up your own rules you
can open your own theater

ENID
But I was only trying to be
friendly

MANAGER
Look we dont pay you to be a movie
critic -- just do your job

ENID
Okay okay I wont say a word

ANOTHER ANGLE - an hour has gone by

CUSTOMER
Medium popcorn

ENID
Thats three dollars

CUSTOMER
Let me have plenty of butter on that

ENID
Ewww
(making a face)
Here you go -- smothered in delicious
yellow-chemical sludge

MANAGER
(pulling her aside)
What the hell is wrong with you

ENID
What Im just kidding around with
the customers Its my shtick
MANAGER

Well lose it And why arent you
pushing the large sizes Didnt you
get training about upsizing

ENID
But I feel weird its so sleazy

MANAGER
Its not optional

ENID
Jesus

CUSTOMER 2
Can I get a medium sprite

ENID
A medium sprite Why sir do you not
know that for a mere twenty five
cents more you could purchase a large
beverage that has a volume of over
twice that of a puny medium drink
(she gives MANAGER a

look)
Im only telling you this because
were such good friends -- Medium is

strictly for suckers who dont
understand the concept of value

INT THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY
Rebecca is behind the counter glaring at Enid

REBECCA
What are you talking about What
kind of loser gets fired after one
day

ENID
I told you - my manager was a total
asshole Dont worry Im going to
get another job and anyway I
have some ideas for how to make money
in the meantime

An angry CUSTOMER returns with her drink
CUSTOMER
Im not at all happy with this latte
what do you intend to do about it

EXT ENIDS GARAGE SALE - DAY
Its the next day Enid has set up a GARAGE SALE in

front of
her apartment building Rebecca arrives
REBECCA
This is it I cant believe youre

ENID
Fuck it Everything must go
REBECCA
Oh my god I remember this hat

A trendy young HIPSTER happens along and looks through
the
clothes then to the table where he picks up a
ridiculous
looking stuffed animal
HIPSTER
How much is this
ENID
Thats not for sale
HIPSTER
(noticing price tag)
Wait it says five dollars
ENID
Oh thats a mistake -- I decided
not to sell it
The HIPSTER looks around a little more and then leaves
REBECCA
What was that all about I thought
everything must go
ENID
Oh yeah right like Im gonna let
some asshole with a goatee own Goofy
Gus
A couple is browsing The GIRL a severely skinny
CLUBHOPPER

ENID
(long pause)

ENID
Five hundred

GIRL

ENID
I was wearing that dress the day I
lost my virginity

GIRL
Well why do I care about that

ENID

look stupid on you

GIRL
God fuck you

Enid turns to the boy - hes holding some records and a

book
ENID
Put that stuff back its not for
sale
BOY

What is this Some fuckin joke

ENID
Yes Go away

They stomp off

REBECCA
Now are you going to get a regular

ENID
(defeated quiet)
Dont worry

REBECCA
If it makes you feel any better I
dont think you couldve gotten more
than ten bucks for all this stuff

ENID
Yeah thanks

EXT ENIDS GARAGE SALE - DAY

Twenty minutes later Most of the stuff is gone Enid

Well are we still going shopping

ENID
Yeah I guess call me
She heads toward the stairs with the box Rebecca
watches

REBECCA
Since when can you make a cake
INT SEYMOURS ROOM - EVENING
Enid presents Seymour with a HOSTESS CUPCAKE with a
single

lit candle in the center The lights are off

ENID
You can open your eyes now

SEYMOUR
Oh uh thanks a lot Enid I
really appreciate it

ENID
No Doofus blow it out

He leans forward and blows out the candle then
abruptly

straightens up and holds the small of his back in pain
Enid

turns the lights back on

SEYMOUR
Arrrghhh Ah Jeez Christ

ENID
Are you okay

SEYMOUR
Its just my stupid back Ill be
all right in a minute

She notices him adjust something under his shirt

ENID
What is that

SEYMOUR
Oh uh Its just this elastic
thing I have to wear for lumbar
support

ENID

What like a girdle

SEYMOUR
Maybe now you understand why I cant
get a date

ENID

Yeah well youre not the only one
Everybody I know has totally fucked
up problems It seems like only
stupid people have good
relationships

SEYMOUR
(sarcastically cheering
her on)
Thats the spirit

ENID
I mean Im eighteen years old and
Ive never even had a real steady
boyfriend for more than like two
weeks

SEYMOUR
Really

ENID
Never

SEYMOUR

Im starting to think that even if I
did get a girlfriend it really
wouldnt change anything

ENID
I know Its not like it makes all
your problems go away

SEYMOUR
Then again thats easy for me to
say since Ill never even get a
date Im sure you have hundreds of
guys who are interested in you

ENID
Actually Ive got a total crush on
this one guy right now but its a
really fucked-up situation

SEYMOUR
Oh yeah
ENID
Oh wait you met him remember

that guy Josh Im like practically
obsessed with him but I cant do
anything about it because Becky would
freak out

SEYMOUR
Why

ENID
Never mind its way too
complicated

(pause)
Did you have problems like this when
you were my age - where youre totally
confused all the time

SEYMOUR
I wont even dignify that witha
response

He gets up and looks through his shelves for a record

ENID
(looking at his records)
I wonder if you really like all these
old records or if you only like the
fact that nobody else likes them

SEYMOUR
(a sore subject)
Who knows

The phone RINGS Seymour ignores it

ENID
Arent you going to get that

SEYMOUR
Let the machine get it I have no
desire to talk to anyone who would
be calling me

After several more RINGS the machine picks up and we

hear
Seymours message After the BEEP theres a long
fumbling
pause
SEYMOUR
I knew it its my mother

VOICE ON MACHINE

ENID
That didnt sound like a joke to
me what did you write a personal

ad or something

SEYMOUR
(still confused)
Uh yeah A long time ago she called

trying to humiliate me

ENID
Seymour I promise you that wasnt a
joke -- you have to call her back
SEYMOUR

How can you be so sure

ENID
Well uh Im an expert-about stuff

INT ENIDS APARTMENT - ABOUT 10 PM
Enid enters - a light is on in the kitchen

DAD (0S)
Pumpkin Could you come in here for
a minute

She walks slowly to the kitchen - a suspenseful moment
She

sees first her Dad (wearing an apron) and then a
hauntingly

familiar MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

DAD
Pumpkin do you remember Maxine

(another silent pause)

What are you studying You were always
such a smart little girl

ENID
Im taking a remedial high school
art class for fuck-ups and retards
INT ART CLASS - DAY
A toothy zit-covered 14-YEAR-OLD BOY poses with a very

made sculpture A flash goes off and he jumps slightly
sending pieces of his sculpture flying

Its Roberta taking photos She moves on to Enid in
of her big painting

ROBERTA
Smile Enid

Enid ad-libs a weird expression as the flash goes

Roberta now turns to address the class

ROBERTA
Im going to miss you people I
feel that weve all done a lot of
growing this summer I hope that
each of you feels as though youll
be taking away something from this
experience I know I certainly will
be

A long poignant pause as she smiles admiringly at
them

ROBERTA
Remember the art show is this
Saturday at seven-thirty sharp Try
to get there at least 15 minutes
early

The students get their things together and file out

ROBERTA
Enid can I talk to you for a minute

ENID
Uh-oh

ROBERTA
Dont worry - its nothing bad I

ENID

seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish
the first time)
DIRECTOR

have to take that painting down
Several of the parents have

complained

ROBERTA
I will do no such thing

DIRECTOR
Then you leave me no other choice
than to remove it myself

She marches towards it Roberta runs after her

ROBERTA
I think we should give the artist a
chance to talk to the parents about
her intentions with this piece

We should be promoting discussion as
a solution not censorship

Roberta sees Margaret and grabs her

ROBERTA

like a little kids room
SEYMOUR
I could never move - Ive got too
much stuff
Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the
corner

She goes over and picks it up

ENID
Where did you get this

SEYMOUR
Dana bought it when we went antique
shopping She said it didnt go with
her stuff so she gave it to me
she thought it fit in better with my
old time thingamajigs

ENID
Jesus how can you stand her

Seymour takes another slug off the bottle
SEYMOUR
God shes going to kill me this
bottle is half-empty

ENID
Thats great Half-empty - thats

a natural pessimist

SEYMOUR
If you expect the worst youre never
disappointed

ENID
What are you talking about Youre

disappointed every minute of your
life

SEYMOUR
Im just being realistic

ENID
At least youre not like every other
stupid guy in the world - all they
care about are guitars and sports
theyre all such fags

SEYMOUR
I hate sports

ENID
How come in all that time I was trying
to get you a date you never asked
me out

SEYMOUR
Youre a beautiful young girl I
cant imagine you would ever have
had any interest in me except as an
amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity

ENID
Yeah but still its kind of
insulting for a girl to be ignored
like that

SEYMOUR
I mean of course I why wouldnt
I want to go out with you

ENID
I dunno I always feel like
everybody secretly hates me Im

just paranoid I guess I mean you
like me dont you Were good friends
right

SEYMOUR
Yeah sure Of course

ENID
(contemplative pause)
-Maybe I should just move in here
with you I could do all the cooking
and dust your record collection and
stuff until I get a job

SEYMOUR
What about Joe

ENID

Oh yeah and Dana

(says her name with

whiny disdainful

voice)
You were a lot more fun before you
met Dana Youve been acting way too
normal lately youre a bitter
twisted fucked-up guy Seymour
thats why I like you

SEYMOUR
(more drunk than before)
Yeah well I like you too

TEN MINUTES LATER
The bottle is empty

ENID
You know what my number one fantasy
used to be

SEYMOUR
(pause)
What

ENID
I used to think about one day not
telling anybody and just taking off
and going to some random place
Do you ever think about stuff like
that
SEYMOUR
I guess I probably used to when I
was your age

ENID
It would have to be some totally
average day when nobody was expecting
it and Id just disappear and theyd
never see me again

SEYMOUR
Sounds like a healthy way to deal
with your problems

ENID
You know what we should do Lets go
get in your car right now and just
take off We could just drive away
and find some new place and start a
whole new life fuck everybody

SEYMOUR
I dont think Im in any condition
to drive

ENID
Ill drive then -- well go out in
a blaze of glory

SEYMOUR
So where would we go

ENID

SEYMOUR
ENID
Whats the matter with you Seymour

merciful
brevity

away somewhere

ENID
What Maybe no I dunno

SEYMOUR

ENID

She could at least have the decency
to call me back
JOE
Maybe she was just using you to try
and get back at some guy Who knows
It could be a million things Its

Again no answer from Seymour he stares off into space

JOE
Maybe shes got another boyfriend

SEYMOUR
(bummed out wants
Joe to stop)
Yeah well thanks for cheering me

for him

EXT SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON
Seymours car screeches into the parking lot He bursts
the store ready for once in his life to make a scene
INT SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON
Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee
with his back to the entrance as Seymour storms in
over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine
SEYMOUR
I hope you had a good laugh at my
expense
Josh turns around - whats going on He recognizes
JOSH
Huh oh hi uh
SEYMOUR

INT ENID and REBECCAS APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT

The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh annoying
streetlight Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat

exasperated She goes to look out the window Cars with
radios can be heard driving by She goes to the phone -
checks it and hangs up Pause She picks it up again -
last try She dials the number and waits We hear the
of the answering machine Rebecca hangs up

She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center
cold linoleum floor) She zips the zipper all the way
her head and curls up into a whimpering ball

FADE TO

TITLE CARD SEVERAL MONTHS LATER
INT THERAPISTS OFFICE - DAY
The dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card
We slowly fade in to see Seymour lying on a pink

psychiatrists couch as he speaks to his THERAPIST a
handsome well-coiffed woman in her late 40s

SEYMOUR
I have to admit things have really
started looking up for me since my
life turned to shit

THERAPIST
So tell me more about this job
What exactly will you be doing

SEYMOUR
Well mostly archival research
cataloguing old records and writing
liner notes for their CD reissues
Its really I cant believe it

THERAPIST
Remember what I said when we first
started -- this little breakdown
might turn out to be the best thing
that ever happened to you

SEYMOUR
It doesnt pay very much but I should
be able to afford my own place ina
few months Do you think thats
too soon Im really anxious to get
my record collection out of storage

THERAPIST
Why dont we start with that next
week

Seymour looks up She nods toward the large wall clock
behind

her thirty seconds after five Re gets up and she
walks him

slowly toward the door

SEYMOUR
Thank you doctor

THERAPIST
(as she opens the
door)
Dont thank me Youre doing all the
work

A pause They stand facing each other

THERAPIST
Seymour

SEYMOUR
Yes

THERAPIST
Do you have a check for me

Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket

In
the waiting room we see SEYMOURS MOTHER
MOTHER
Seymour Are you done Did you have
a chance to think about what you
might want for dinner while you were
in there
SEYMOUR
We can talk about it in the car
Ma
As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at
the
doctor
INT QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON
The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles
Wowsville
more than the old Quality Cafe There are no
neighborhood

characters

anymore only well-heeled twenty-
somethings We

see that Rebecca is now a waitress here She tears off

a
check and places it in front of a super-muscular polo
shirted
EUROPEAN HIPSTER who is too busy tapping away at his
POWERBOOK to notice
She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her
receipts She looks up and sees Enid wearing tasteful
1930s

style clothes sitting across from her

ENID
Hi
REBECCA
Oh hi I almost didnt recognize

you -- I think I need to get glasses
out

then

youre all blurry

ENID
(nodding toward
muscular HIPSTER)
Youre lucky then you cant see the
veins on that guys biceps

REBECCA
Actually hes a really nice guy

We see at this point that Rebecca and Enid are no longer
friends but there are also no hard feelings evident

REBECCA
Do you want anything

ENID
Maybe an orange juice

Rebecca goes to get it Enid looks around bemused and
saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become

ENID
Hey look what I got

She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls
her DIPLOMA

REBECCA
Wow finally

ENID
It just came yesterday

Pause Josh enters Enid turns around

JOSH
Hi Enid

ENID
Hey Josh

JOSH

Are you ready to go

For a moment its not clear who hes talking to and

REBECCA
(still counting
receipts)
Yeah just one second

She finishes takes off her apron and emerges from

behind
the counter She kisses Josh perfunctorily
REBECCA
(to Josh)
Did you remember to pay the phone
bill
JOSH
Yeah
REBECCA
(to Enid)
Call me sometime
ENID
Definitely We still have to go to
that shoe store sometime
Rebecca and Josh leave Enid is totally alone in the now-
alien
world of the Quality Cafe A momentary pause as she
calmly
stares into her orange juice We see a small round
TRAVEL
BAG at her feet
EXT CITY STREETSACME SHOES - EVENING
We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her
world
Its early evening quiet except for distant street
noises
She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE
It
looks the same miraculously preserved until she
stands
right in front of it She looks through the partially
papered
over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new
fixtures
a modern counter and several small tables all made
from a
FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC A sign in the window reads
Coming

Soon Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE

EXT CITY STREET - EVENING

She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a
stillness to the city She turns a corner and is

her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass
stops and looks at herself Everything about her looks
for once no need to change a thing She moves closer
glass and shading her eyes tries to look inside

She continues walking Darkness is just setting in and
has the street all to herself

EXT COMMERCIAL AREABUS STOP - NIGHT

We see Enid at NORMANS BUS STOP sitting on the bench
looks at the apartment building across the street A
who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV
her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT The same
happens in another window down the street then

Enid looks down the street In the distance A BUS
corner and heads toward her

From a third-story window across the street we see the
as it arrives and stops blocking Enid from view A
later it pulls away leaving an empty bench The CAMERA
upward farther and farther away as the music swells
credits roll

EXT BRIDGE - EVENING

The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge

THE END
