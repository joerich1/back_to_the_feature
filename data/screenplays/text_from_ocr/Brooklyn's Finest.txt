INT APARTMENT 5A -— NIGHT

Beamer cleans a set of high powered GUNS KRock weighs
cocaine on a hand scale

Sal breezes in gun in hand but it’s dangling by his side
More helpless than dangerous Beamer and K-Rock not sure
7 what to make of the lone cop Beamer stands Tec-9 ready
Sal closes his eyes Ready for the bullets Ready to die

BANG

Beamer DROPS the Tec-9 Raises his hands signaling his
surrender K-Rock not one to be out of place surrenders
too Sal opens his eyes Cant believe what he’s seeing
The bathroom toilet FLUSHES Sal heads to

At that moment Sal realizes the foolishness of his half-
baked suicide plan

With no time to dwell on that Sal desperately searches
around he’s running out of options Sees the bedroom door
The last hope Kicks it down -- empty Sal staggers
backwards SLAMS against the closed hallway closet Drops to
the floor Dejected Failed again

We HEAR a COLLAPSE in the closet followed by HUNDRED DOLLAR
BILLS protruding from the open slots al opens the closet --
