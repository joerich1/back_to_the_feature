desperate with each failed effort

Norah watches Rose struggle with the window

Pigeons gather at her feet and she gives a little kick

the strawberry flavoring If you
eat a whole lot of it it gives you
bionic strength

The girl gives Oscar a long stare

The girl ties a strand of hair to her pigtail then loops the
invisible strand over a pencil She glances over to Oscar
Oscar doesnt flinch

With school girl slight of hand the pigtail rises and falls
It is a magical flirtatious pigtail greeting

Oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal
the Lil Bastard tattoo The girl smiles Oscar smiles
INT GORILLA FOUNDATION - ONE MONTH LATER - DAY 174
Norah walks down a corridor The kitten clings to her She
turns the corner and walks though a set of doors to what

Blocks and brightly colored plastic toys litter the ground
Sitting in the middle of the play area is an enormous black
gorilla KOKO She turns her massive head and looks at Norah
KOKO

KoKo responds with thick hands
NORAH
