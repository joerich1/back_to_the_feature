2080 AD UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

EXT CHINATOWN - DAWN
A sleepy morning in this cramped Chinese ghetto

A SHOPKEEPER rolls his shop door open reveals his 400 sq ft
“shop” is also his “home”

He sees --
MEN IN FULL SWAT GEAR pass rifles drawn

The Shopkeeper pulls his door closed again knows his place

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING CHINATOWN - MOMENTS LATER

A BLACK-GLOVED HAND secures a quarter-sized device to the
center of the back door A soft CRACK and the door spiderwebs
and shatters in an instant

The SWAT TEAM moves in VOICES SHOUT - chaos within

GUNFIRE rings through the street

But this is Chinatown Nobody notices Nor do they do
anything but stare as the SWAT TEAM emerges with a shirtless

TATTOOED MAN with a black bag over his head and shoves him
into the back of a van

We watch now from a CAR ACROSS THE STREET

INT CAR - SAME

AGENT WILSON black suit in the front seat On the passenger
side ANNE REEVES (30 sad) She’s in plain clothes

AGENT WILSON
I’11 be damned

On Anne’s face countless regrets
AGENT WILSON
(into his bluetooth)
Yes Sir Rathbone is in pocket
coming your way Her intel was spot
on

Whatever is said on the other line makes Wilson look at Anne

AGENT WILSON

You sure about that --
(then)
Yes sir

Agent Wilson starts the car

EXT ANNE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
Agent Wilson parks Looks up at the skyscraper apartment

AGENT WILSON
What a shit hole

He reaches over and UNCUFFS Anne

AGENT WILSON
Get outta my fucking car

Anne’s confused

AGENT WILSON

Director’s orders If it were up to
me I’d put you behind bars ‘til
you pissed yourself to death

(beat)

Get out you’re getting your rebel
stink all over my fuckin’ leather

Anne does as she’s told Wilson drives off

TITLE 8 WEEKS LATER

EXT STREET DINER - NIGHT

A LONG CHOW LINE of minorities and welfare cases At a street-
facing window they’re handed a bowl of soup and old bread -
but only after they show a passport or immigration papers

Anne shows her PASSPORT The word DEFECTOR is stamped in red

She collects her dinner hustles off These past 8 weeks have
not been kind to her

EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Anne walks down a thronged street gulping her soup She
tosses her empty bowl on the filthy street

There are so many people they pour over the sidewalks and
into the road

POLICE OFFICERS patrol with loaded weapons It’s like a scene
from a 3rd world city

Except of course for the obscene skyscrapers and high-tech
shops with HOLOGRAPHIC SIGNS that scan each passerby to
tailor their message to the individual

She passes a CLOTHING STORE - a hologram dress model appears
in front of her face But that’s not what interests her --

In the reflection off a window a HOODED MAN watches her

EXT METRO STATION - LATER

Anne exits into acid rain Droplets sizzle as they hit her
jacket She throws her hood up jogs across the street

The HOODED MAN emerges follows her

Anne gets buried in the crowd of umbrellas and raincoats The
HOODED MAN picks up his pace -- hurries into

AN ALLEYWAY

And is slammed into the wall The GUN in his jacket now
presses against his chin

ANNE
Jesus Charlie

She backs off shakes out her nerves

ANNE
You scared the holy shit out of me
CHARLIE
I did

The sweet-faced blonde takes his gun back

CHARLIE
You had that crazy look in your
eye

Anne smiles and smacks him They’re old friends

ANNE
Stalker You could just y’know
call

CHARLIE

No I couldn’t

INT DARK ROOM - LATER

Anne stands staring at us Dressed now in a pressed suit -
she’s intimidating Also conflicted about being here The
sadness has returned to her eyes

DIRECTOR AMOS (50s salt and pepper hair a politician) enters

DIRECTOR AMOS
Thank you for coming

ANNE
You already said that

DIRECTOR AMOS
It bears repeating

ANNE
I didn’t really have a choice did
I Sending Charlie was a nice
touch

DIRECTOR AMOS
A friendly face

ANNE
Why the things you do still
surprise me
She snatches a TABLET (an iPad with more finesse) from him
exits without another word

Amos steps up and we realize Anne was staring through a TWO-
WAY MIRROR at the Tattooed Man (JAMES RATHBONE 25)
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

-He dangles from chains in the middle of this dark dank
terrible place Cement walls His own piss shit and blood on
the floor

He’s set to balance all his weight on the balls of his feet
His naked body is gory and bruised from weeks of torture We
notice now his TATTOOS are all Revolutionary and Anti-American

Anne enters He stirs at the sound body weak The sight of
him breaks Anne’s heart But before he can see that her
expression changes she’s impossible to read now

When Rathbone sees her he cries But he quickly composes
himself and forces his lips into a bloody smile

RATHBONE
Must be bad If they’ve sent for
the Whore of Babylon

Anne pulls up a chair Reads through the tablet

ANNE
Would you like something to drink

RATHBONE
How have you been Annie

ANNE
Water Whiskey You still drinking
Bulleit

RATHBONE

You look like shit
He laughs but gets nothing from her The coldness hurts

RATHBONE
I have nothing to say to you
This hurts Anne hard She tries not to let it show

ANNE
Well that seems to fit perfectly
with our information actually
(scrolling)
Our informant close to your leader
this Michael Holmes says --

RATHBONE
Did you know that I knew

ANNE
He says that you are little more
than a lackey

RATHBONE
I knew for months Maybe I thought
you’d tell me yourself

ANNE
You find kids off the streets
teach them some party rhetoric and
hit the front lines A pimp for
cannon fodder

RATHBONE
I guess in your own way
(gestures to this
hellhole)
You did

INT DARK ROOM - SAME

A man

more like a snake than a man
His face is hidden in shadow

DIRECTOR AMOS
She can’t be trusted

THE DOCTOR
You really think patriotism is the
only kind of loyalty

DIRECTOR AMOS
(containing anger)
It’s the only kind that matters

steps up beside Amos
We’11 call him THE DOCTOR
From the intercom

RATHBONE
(re the tablet)
Those pictures are fakes

ANNE
You know the reason your father
sees you as a mediocre son Because
of this right here James Your
brothers all made it up to the top
Regional leaders of this so-called
“party” of yours And you gave it
all up because I smiled pretty for
you Look at you now I mean what
has your dad to be proud of

Rathbone looks at Anne heartbroken in spite of himself

RATHBONE
What have they done to you Annie

Anne doesn’t skip a beat Continues her interrogation as --

THE DOCTOR
Your faith in nationalism is
exactly why we’ve failed before
Prep her

He walks out

Amos goes on watching

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

ANNE
You’re sitting here because we
could put you here Because you’re
a fuck up James Rathbone the
Third Not even worthy of that
name Just like your father always
said

She lets that sink in Knows it’s a button
ANNE
You’re right I am wasting my time
I always was with you

She gets up to go

RATHBONE
I’1l take that Bulleit now

Anne stops at the doorway she’s got him

INT DARK ROOM - SAME

Amos sighs Doesn’t like Anne but damn she’s good

INT OUTSIDE DIRECTOR AMOS’S OFFICE - LATER
Charlie walks Anne up

CHARLIE
(pause)
You okay

ANNE
Are you my escort

CHARLIE
You’ re technically a visitor now

Anne looks around like things are different since she was
last here

ANNE
You’re nervous

CHARLIE
I’m always nervous You know that

ANNE
What’s different about today

CHARLIE
Sometimes I think you can just
smell it Like some kind of feral
beast

(MORE)
CHARLIE (CONTD)
(beat)
How

ANNE
You shaved your beard You only do
that for two reasons

CHARLIE
(touches his clean neck)
When I want to look pretty

ANNE
You forgot cologne Which usually
goes with pretty

Charlie sniffs himself unconsciously

CHARLIE
Shaving calms me

ANNE
I know

CHARLIE
(pause gets quiet)
I justI don’t think you should
take --
Amos’s door opens An ASSISTANT walks out
Charlie instantly goes quiet
Anne notices his reaction but there’s no time to ask -
ASSISTANT
You can go in Miss Reeves

INT DIRECTOR AMOS’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Amos sits at his desk before a circular window that overlooks
a dirty city making him look like the Emperor of Purgatory

The Assistant pulls the door closed behind Anne Being in a
room alone with Amos makes her uncomfortable

DIRECTOR AMOS
Not nervous are we Agent Reeves
Anne shifts

ANNE
Uncertainty is always
discomfiting

(afterthought)
Sir

The SOUND OF AMOS’S PEN scribbling notes on a digital page

ANNE
To be honest I don’t appreciate
what you just made me do

Amos’s pen stops He looks up

DIRECTOR AMOS
That’s not really my concern

Amos’s desk acts like a giant tablet computer He pushes a
digital file across the desk It hits the edge and pops up
a floating HOLOGRAM It’s ANNE’S FILE video photos

documents from her life as a secret agent

DIRECTOR AMOS
You’ve been reinstated Effective
this morning

ANNE
(sighs)
I thought we agreed I wouldn’t
come back Ever

DIRECTOR AMOS
Things change

ANNE
What things

DIRECTOR AMOS
I’d like to offer you a new
assignment

He pushes a NEW FILE across the desk It replaces Anne’s

holographic file It’s video news articles

photos of a

prison in the middle of an ocean -- RAVENSBROOK PRISON

as

DIRECTOR AMOS
Two months ago our chief operative
in Moscow learned that the Russians
are diverting an inordinate amount
of funds to Ravensbrook Prison
Global Lucent Technologies built
owns and operates the prison and

is --

ANNE
The world’s leading defense
contractor

DIRECTOR AMOS
Yes

ANNE
Did he say what they’re building
for the Russians The agent

Anne is at the hologram now scrolling through the interface

DIRECTOR AMOS
Before any intel could be gathered
the agent was burned Sent by the
Russians to Ravensbrook as a
political prisoner

ANNE
The lion’s den Intentional then

DIRECTOR AMOS
That was the assumption But last
week our man on the inside lost
contact It’s like the agent just
disappeared

ANNE
How do you disappear in a prison

Amos throws out his hands His sentiment exactly

DIRECTOR AMOS
We’d like you to pick up where our
agent left off
ANNE

(laughs)
You’ve got to be kidding me You
fire me and call me a traitor I
can’t get a job an apartment or
credits to buy food And now you
want to put me in deep cover after
making me do what I just did in
there

(beat)
Fuck you How about that

Anne walks out Almost at the door --

DIRECTOR AMOS
Your sister is the agent

Anne stops

DIRECTOR AMOS
The one our contact lost seven days
ago

Anne can barely process this

DIRECTOR AMOS
We don’t know your sister’s state
If she’s even alive we assume
she’s been tortured maybe even

turned
ANNE
(too quickly)
Not Beth

DIRECTOR AMOS
Well you know her best and with
your background in psychology your
on-site evaluation could be very
useful You have a gift shall we
say of getting into the heads of
prisoners

He’s referring to Rathbone Anne wants to murder him

ANNE

We need to know if and when the
Russians are going to wipe us from
the map This mission saves lives
Agent Reeves Plain and simple

(beat)
You may not believe in me or your
country anymore but at least we
can agree that innocent people
should not be annihilated

Anne hates that he’s making sense

DIRECTOR AMOS

And of course if you accept your
record will be expunged You will
be a full-fledged citizen again

Anne scoffs at the added blackmail

Amos hands her a new TABLET

DIRECTOR AMOS
You have the day

EXT AGENCY HEADQUARTERS - SUNRISE

A nondescript building built to be incognito Charlie walks
Anne out

ANNE
Is it weird To have wanted this I
mean your whole life to have
wanted this Are we sick

CHARLIE
I don’t know I just learned
languages to pick up chicks Figure
it increases the odds if I can be
charming in more than one tongue
Double entendre intennnnded

Charlie always makes her feel better Not this time
ANNE
Thing is I did want this Ever
since my sister and I were kids
it’s what we wanted There was
never anything else to want My dad
made sure of that I just didn’t
know it was going to look like
this

CHARLIE
Like what

ANNE
(pause)
Like it doesn’t matter

She instantly regrets saying it

She walks

CHARLIE
Don’t let anyone but me hear you
say that Especially now

ANNE
I know You’re right I didn’t mean
it

CHARLIE

You’re just upset

ANNE
Yeah

off

CHARLIE
Hey Annie I really am sorry about
Rathbone I wish this all had gone
differently

ANNE
Yeah Me too See you tomorrow

INT ANNE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Entirely white Perfectly clean Very small

Anne sits on the floor in Harvard sweatpants watching
HOLOGRAMS of old family videos They dance around her some
in the foreground some in the back

A half-drunk bottle of Pinot Noir next to her
ON VIDEO

7-YEAR-OLD BETH and 8-YEAR-OLD ANNE hold rifles Anne looks
like a kid just forced away from video games to do homework

Beth jumps up and down a ball of excitement
Their DAD is behind the camera --

DAD (OS)
OK Place the stock of the rifle
against your shoulder Anne c’mon
sweetheart

Anne mutes the video

ON SCREEN Dad now leaves the camera to fix Beth’s stance
Little Anne just watches her dad spend all his time on Beth
Still she stands attentively waiting to be seen

ANNE’ S APARTMENT

Grown-up Anne hits a new file on the tablet A video pops up
in HOLOGRAM in front of her

This video is of adult Beth The caption ENTRANCE INTERVIEW
BETH REEVES

BETH
No I have never committed a crime
he only person who ever has in my
amily is my sister She stole
ruit once Just like that Like it
elonged to her I always remember
hat when I think of the rebels
hey think the world belongs to
hem and they can just take it
ike an ignorant child
(hears the interviewer)
Why am I here There is an entire
world out there living in darkness
(MORE)

Pt aet ohms

BETH (CONTD)
And I see the Agency as this great
light This great light in that
darkness You are the good I want
to see in the world

Anne plays a new video This one very different

Here Beth’s face is beaten her nose bloody Chunks of hair
are missing She’s being fed lines 0S by someone in
Russian

BETH
I am a devious traitor I have lied
to my family and friends I am not
a student in Moscow I ama

(sobs)

-I am a capitalist rebel I have
killed three Russian citizens and
yesterday I tried to assassinate
the President

She SCREAMS in terror as someone knocks her off her chair A
RUSSIAN NATIONALIST gets right in the camera now

Anne pauses it Mind far away
BETH (VO)
You’re sorry
EXT BETH’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK

Their childhood house from the family video A colonial house
with a yard Where Beth and Anne now fight

BETH
You think that word means anything
right now You have sided with a
traitor

ANNE
It’s not like that

BETH
So you’re just fucking him

That stings

ANNE
I’m not seeing him anymore We’ re
done

BETH

That’s not enough This isn’t about
you Anne When are you going to
get that through your head The
world is not about you and what you
want You --
(pause takes a breath)
I don’t have time for this I’ve
got a flight Because unlike you I
still do my job

Beth goes back into the house

ANNE
What do you want me to do Beth

Beth turns over her shoulder

BETH
You know what you need to do And
until then I don’t want to see
your face again
Beth disappears inside the house

Anne is left outside heartbroken

RETURN TO

INT ANNE’S APARTMENT - DAY - PRESENT
Anne surrounded by holographic files photos the video of
them as children of Beth’s entrance interview Beth’s bloody

face in the interrogation video

She makes her decision

INT DIRECTOR AMOS’S OFFICE - MORNING

Anne stands at Amos’s desk

ANNE
I’11 do it But Beth isn’t going to
like that I’m the one going in
after her She might not even go
with me

DIRECTOR AMOS
I think you misunderstood This is
first and foremost a gathering of
intel The extraction of Beth and
even yourself are secondary
priorities

ANNE
Right Of course it is

DIRECTOR AMOS
Do I have to remind you of your
duty --

ANNE
No

DIRECTOR AMOS
(pause)
Was I wrong to ask this of you

ANNE
No sir Country Corps God
Family

DIRECTOR AMOS
Good Then let’s get you in there

EXT RAVENSBROOK HELIPAD - DAY

A HELIPLANE approaches a landing dock in the middle of the
Pacific Ocean There are a few buildings above water but we
can see a giant structure beneath the surface

DIRECTOR AMOS (VO)
Ravensbrook Prison except for a
few administrative offices is
built completely underwater

INT RAVENSBROOK INTAKE - DAY

Anne shuffles in chains led by TWO FEMALE GUARDS Her photo
is taken against a white brick wall

LATER

DIRECTOR AMOS (VO)
We don’t know how deep it goes But
it’s rumored that it can hold up to
100000 prisoners at one time
making it the largest prison in the
world

Anne strips naked as FEMALE GUARDS search her

DIRECTOR AMOS (VO)
The reason we know very little is
because the prison itself is one of
Global Lucent’s most classified
technologies Not even the warden
is permitted to see the entire
prison

Anne’s long hair is cut to a short bob

INT

DIRECTOR AMOS (VO)
When you have gathered intel on
what the Russians are developing at
Ravensbrook you will report back
to our man on the inside He will
arrange for you to be transferred

ANNE (VO)
How will I know him

DIRECTOR AMOS’S OFFICE - DAY

Anne looks at pictures and news footage of the prison One
headline reads IS PRISON UNDER-THE-SEA REALLY IMPENETRABLE

DIRECTOR AMOS
You won’t He’1ll find you

INT RAVENSBROOK INTAKE QUARANTINE ROOM

Anne now in a prison jumpsuit is tossed into a clean white
room One wall is a mirror She looks at it suspiciously --

Up at the ceiling -- there are CAMERAS in the corners
So it begins
DIRECTOR AMOS (VO)
Once you’re in Agent Reeves it’s

best you think of yourself

Anne sits against the wall and stares across the room at a
reflection of the new her

DIRECTOR AMOS (VO)
»as alone

INT RAVENSBROOK INTAKE QUARANTINE ROOM - LATER

Anne has fallen asleep seated A SCRAPING wakes her --

The mirrored wall retreats into the floor to reveal a
hospital room beyond

A MAN in a white lab coat enters with a tablet and a smile
He’s kind the way all fathers should look

DR MARSH
Hello Anne My name is Doctor
Benjamin Marsh Please step right
this way

Anne does as she’s told She sits on the hospital bed
according to Marsh’s gentle gesture

DR MARSH
Are you tired

ANNE
I’m okay

DR MARSH
Of course you are Now what do we
have here Let’s take a look at
you

He SCANS HER WRIST with is tablet Her report immediately

pops up He scrolls through

DR MARSH
A travel agent out of Los Angeles
First degree murder Your
boyfriend Repeated calls to the
police about abuse go unheeded

Anne notices an old blood stain on the bed sheet

A shadow draws her gaze to a window in the ceiling

someone was just up there watching her

ANNE
This doesn’t look like a prison

DR MARSH
Hmm What does it look like Anne

ANNE
A psych ward

DR MARSH
(smiles)
Yes Well it does take a certain
psychology to be in here don’t you
think When was your last period

ANNE
The seventeenth

He notes this on his tablet

DR MARSH
This is quarantine Blood pressure
is a little high Not nervous are
we All our incoming inmates must
be thoroughly checked before
they’ re permitted into general
population

He sticks a thermometer in her ear

if
DR MARSH
We have a very special and delicate
system here Anne and unlike
government prisons you’ll find we
have and maintain very high
standards to uphold the balance
Your temperature is normal

He notes this

DR MARSH
Well you’re in safe hands All
things considered You’1l find none
of the usual transgressions that
occur in government prisons

He sticks a tongue depressor in her mouth

DR MARSH
Say “ahh” We have had no fights
No riots No homicides No male
guards are allowed on the women’s
side no female guards on the male

ANNE
Is this your way of telling me I’11l
never see another man for as long
as I live

Marsh chuckles

DR MARSH
I think that’s the negative spin
don’t you Besides you’1ll always
have me every six months And I’m
quite a treat No STDs Genetic
illnesses

ANNE
No Breast cancer My grandma

DR MARSH
That’s too bad

He makes note of this

DR MARSH
Well your heart looks healthy Your
internal organs are all working as
scheduled for someone your age and
weight You seem normal

The emphasis makes it sound like a bad thing

DR MARSH
Your bruises I’m guessing are
from the uh event

Anne nods

DR MARSH
They seem to be healing normally

He presses her bruises and the cut on her eye not even
seeming to notice how Anne winces in pain

DR MARSH
The boyfriend that you killed He
was much taller than you

ANNE
By about eight inches or so I
guess

DR MARSH

How did you murder him

ANNE
You have my file

DR MARSH
Please remove your shirt

She does He examines the muscles in her back like he’s
looking for something particular

DR MARSH
You stabbed him 18 times

He doesn’t find what he’s looking for Seems confused
DR MARSH
What’s interesting is that the
array and depth of the wounds
suggests someone taller and
stronger than yourself

ANNE
If only you could’ve spoken for me
at my hearing

DR MARSH

(smiles)
Yes

(then serious)
You’re here because you fought
back An admirable trait I think
But that’s why they don’t let me
make policy You’re all normal You
can put your shirt back on

He opens the door for the WARDEN and TWO FEMALE GUARDS

DR MARSH
Let’s put her on Grade Yellow watch
for now

Marsh exits like he’s already forgotten about her

INT PREP ROOM

WARDEN (40 kind like a college counselor) piles a towel
of bed sheets and a blanket in Anne’s arms Wrists cuffed to

her hips it’s hard to hold it all
He hands Anne TWO BLUE PILLS in a dixie cup

WARDEN
It’s just like the real world Only
smaller And without sunlight
Welcome to Ravensbrook Anne
Reeves

He walks out leaving BURKE (35 female guard) in

Anne downs the pills

charge

set

INT ELEVATOR
Anne watches Burke swipe her wrist on the DOOR SCANNER

BURKE
Level four

“Voice Recognized R Burke” appears on the scanner

Burke notices Anne watching the scanner count out how many
feet below sea level they descend 50 feet

BURKE

(smiles)
Level Four is 100 feet below the
surface That’s 60 pounds of
pressure on every square inch of
your body That’s about four times
what gravity feels like Feel ita
little bit don’t you Kind of like
you’re suffocating Kind of like
you’re trapped

(beat)
You’1l get used to it

89 feet 90

BURKE
The pills will make it so your
lungs don’t contract You’1l be
able to breathe just fine The
suffocation is your head telling
you you don’t belong 100 feet
underwater

ELEVATOR
Level Four

BURKE
Because you don’t

The elevator door opens

INT LEVEL 4 GUARD STATION - CONTINUOUS

Anne shuffles in to find the hub of the Women’s Prison

ARMED FEMALE GUARDS stand by guns ready or sit at the wall
of flat-screen monitors the eyes of Level 4

Through the observation windows we see everything If it
wasn’t a prison it might be called beautiful --

- Two rows of pristine cells Clear sliding doors Privacy is
a pipe dream here

- Cells encircle a CENTRAL REC COURTYARD It’s like an
affluent playground Fake grass Tables Sports equipment

MIRANDA a guard grabs Anne’s wrist Scans a TRACKING
BRACELET across it

BEEP - it’s activated

She clasps it around Anne’s wrist

BURKE
So you don’t get lost

She nods to a screen with 100 RED DOTS Each in their cells

One LONE RED DOT in the Guard Station Anne

INT LEVEL 4 REC COURTYARD - MINUTES LATER

Cell doors open INMATES flood out into the courtyard --
Some kick soccer balls Play catch Shoot hoops

Crowds form around tables that act as flat-screen TVs and
gaming systems

Anne joins them

She’s stared at Sized up by killers and thieves

For the first time in years Anne feels in over her head
In the corner Anne finds a place alone

From here she has a better view of all the INMATES some
cutthroats others too wholesome for these walls

But no Beth

One WOMAN does catch her eye though

She too stands apart She too watches the others like she
doesn’t belong Her long blonde hair is braided tightly back

She bears herself like an ex-soldier

Her gaze sweeps the yard Like she owns it And everyone in
it

That gaze finally lands on Anneand holds

FISHER (0OS)
They call her Jane

Anne turns to find FISHER (19 a younger Rihanna) sitting at
Anne’s feet She draws nervously on her skin with a plastic
paper clip deep enough to leave scars Tattoos without ink

ANNE
Call her

FISHER
Nobody knows her real name

ANNE
Maybe she doesn’t have one

FISHER
Heh Maybe Who you lookin’ for

ANNE
Excuse me

FISHER
“Excuse me” Where you from a
fuckin’ boarding school I said who
you lookin’ for bitch

Anne smiles at the kid’s gall

FISHER
It’s okay Fuck-ups friend other
fuck-ups It’s the way we work We
all the same You got someone here
Someone from the outside you knew
ANNE

What are you in for

She notices Fisher’s gesture
gaze The answer makes her u

FISHER

ANNE
What do you mean

Fisher a glance at Jane Sh

FISHER

e stands brushes herself off

What do you call yourself

ANNE
Anne Anne Reeves

FISHER
Well like I said
all the same You

Fisher walks right to Jane
and walks off again

Anne Reeves we
figure that out

whispers something in her ear

Jane doesn’t move Her expression is unchanged by Fisher’s
news Her eyes still lock on Anne

INT LEVEL 4 DINING HALL

Three squares on a tin plate Like soap bars Green white
and brown soap boars

Everyone digs in Anne nibbles

Jane sits at the most crowded table She eats like a
disciplined soldier straight quiet efficient

Fisher is among her lackeys chats animatedly But nobody
talks to Jane

DREADS
You got a death wish

DREADS a pretty middle-aged South African woman

DREADS
Don’t even look at her

ANNE
Look at who

DREADS
You don’t want to become of
interest to her Even the guards
leave Jane alone

ANNE
What’s her story

Dreads laughs like Anne’s got nerve She likes that

NADIA (20 Russian) shreds her bars into bite-sized pieces
She’s haggard like she hit the Moscow streets young and
they hit back hard

NADIA
Never mind all that What’s it like
out there Who’s famous these days

ANNE
Same kinds of people I guess
But Nadia and Dreads are a rapt audience

ANNE
Uh boys who look like girls Girls
who look like hookers There’s this
midget that’s become a sex symbol
in Britain

Nadia and Dreads laugh Warming up to Anne

Anne nods

DREADS

So who’d you kill

(beat)
They only send the murderers to
this hellhole Some fuck face beat
your ass one too many times That’s
the usual story Women be in here
‘cuz they fight back that’s all
In a world run by assholes with
dicks --

NADIA
(snort laughs)
“Assholes with dicks”

DREADS
Focus Jesus I’m saying most of us
wouldn’t even be in here if we
weren’t fucked with to begin with
(beat)
So who fucked with you Boyfriend

DREADS
Told you cunt

Nadia sticks out her tongue throws a green bar at

NADIA
Broccoli tastes like mud anyway

DREADS
Nadia thought you’d --

Dreads

NADIA
Drowned your kids You look like a
baby killer
(pause)
They’ re always the quiet ones

ANNE
(pause)
hat about political prisoners

NADIA
(laughs)
They don’t last very long

ANNE
What do you mean

A glare from Dreads shuts Nadia up

ANNE
What do you mean

DREADS
She means nothing usually Look
friendly new girl advice

(beat)
Be invisible Be nobody And you’1l
be fine

INT LEVEL 4 REC COURTYARD

Same activities Same cliques

Anne does sit-ups in the corner But really she’s watching --
The changing of the guard

The patterns of the inmates

Jane

Then a SCREAM pierces the yard It’s coming from a WOMAN on
the 2nd floor cell block

Anne joins Dreads and Nadia at an online poker table

ANNE
What’s going on

DREADS
(without looking)
The man
NADIA

Random cell checks

All faces turn up to the spectacle now Not just curious
faces horrified ones Like they’re watching a dead woman
walking

WOMAN
You fucking whores You can’t just
do this to people Fuck you Fuck
youuuuuuuuuuu

The GUARDS get her to the ground fast

But then Anne’s attention moves to a LITTLE BRUNETTE standing
with Fisher There’s something strange about her reaction

She FLINCHES at the screams Bites back tears She’s the only
one besides Anne not watching the scene

ANNE
Who’s that

DREADS
Who

ANNE

The new girl

NADIA
hat’s Lily

ANNE
She wasn’t here this morning

DREADS
You memorize everyone in a day

ANNE
I’m good with faces

DREADS
Lily was searched last month Same
deal Didn’t even have contraband
But she threw a stink

NADIA
They say it’s like your body feels
death But because of those pills
you can’t die It’s as close to
hell as a person can ever go The
lowest level
(beat)
The Hole

ANNE
Solitary That’s what’s on the last
level

Dreads and Nadia share a look it’s more than that
But to Anne this is hope - maybe Beth is there

WOMAN
No Please no I’m sorry please
I’m so sorry please don’t make me
go there Please I swear to God
I’m so sorry I love you I love
youuuuuuu

LILY has lost it now She falls down weeping
Anne watches as

Fisher tries to comfort her but recoils when she touches the
girl as if Lily’s skin were electrified

Jane is suddenly there Nods for Fisher to get away
Fisher rubs her sore hand leaves
Jane whispers something into Lily’s ear

Anne sees now half of Lily’s face is charred disfigured as
if melted by fire

The GUARDS drag the Woman away

INT LEVEL 4 ANNE’S CELL
Inmates file into their cells for the night

WARDEN
(over the PA)
Alright Lights out ladies The
only sound I want to hear from now
on is snoring

Anne can’t climb into her bunk without stepping on the bottom
bunk

But that could be suicide judging by the death stare coming
from RAMONA a chola with tats creeping out of her collar and
shirt sleeves

Anne jumps up into the bunk instead

The agility and SHRILL SQUEAK of the bed springs makes
everyone turn to look at her

Dreads at a neighboring bunk shakes her head

A white girl with cornrows (ANDY 23) grabs Anne’s hand
Sniffs it Turns to the group

ANDY
Smells like pussy

Anne jerks her hand back Everyone laughs and settles in
Silence eventually takes over

In the hushed darkness Anne realizes for the first time -
she’s BREATHING FAST She’s not as calm as she pretends

RAMONA (0S)
I better not hear you fucking
crying noob

Anne gets a swift kick from Ramona below
Her training takes over -- she controls her breathing

FADE TO

ANNE’S CELL - DREAM

Anne wakes Senses something’s off

One of the Inmates is crying in the corner

Anne creeps out of bed goes to THE GIRL

As she approaches she sees the girl has carved up her arm
with a paper clip Blood everywhere Symbols etched deep into
her skin

Horrified - Anne reaches to stop the girl She turns --

It’s Beth As if possessed she lunges at Anne and stabs her
in the stomach

INT LEVEL 4 ANNE’S CELL - MORNING

The MORNING ALARM BLARES Anne is already awake taking
frantic breaths after that nightmare

WARDEN
(on the PA)
Morning glories Rise and shine
It’s Sunday July 29th and yes
contrary to popular belief you are
alive and no that was not a
nightmare you are in Hell

REC COURTYARD

Something different today

Everyone gathers in a circle around a mat on the floor
Everything’s been cleared out to make room for this -
whatever it is

Anne climbs a bench at the edge of the crowd

In the CIRCLE Fisher and Lily look like they’re about to
start a school yard brawl

Dreads climbs up with her Nadia refuses to watch

Anne sees -- WARDEN and DR MARSH step up to the windows of
the Guard Station

She realizes now that this entire level is rimmed with
windows GUARDS male and female crowd around to watch

This is a modern-day gladiator match

Anne sees Burke look up at the Station - Dr Marsh (not the

Warden) gives the signal to begin

ANNE
What’s going on

BURKE
(steps into the circle)
Today we only have one grievance
That between Kim Fisher and Lily
Thomas It will be settled here as
agreed by both parties Yes

Fisher and Lily nod
Anne notices in Lily’s face - relief

BURKE
Then let’s begin

When Burke steps out of the Circle Fisher and Lily attack
The crowd goes wild

Anytime they step out of the Circle they’re pushed right
back in

The fight is uneven Lily is weak and unskilled Fisher
fights wild and savage like the gang banger she is

Lily’s BLOOD SPRAYS the mat

Anne’s on high alert - senses something’s not right here

She sees

- Marsh watches intently Like he’s studying something here
- The Warden disturbed by the violence

- Guards rimming the room place bets with each other

- Jane the only face here that looks sad

Then Fisher glances at Jane as if for instruction

Jane nods Barely perceptible But for some reason it makes
Lily smile

Fisher beats Lily until her knuckles are broken and Lily’s
face is smashed in

The little brunette crumples lifeless
The CROWD GASPS Silence Then a burst of SAVAGE APPLAUSE

ANNE
Jesus Christ

BURKE
The undisputed winner is Fisher

TWO GUARDS drag Lily’s body away

Anne notices Fisher’s hands and knuckles -- they’re not just
bloodied they’re scalded and blistered

BURKE
Anyone have any grievances to air
this week we’1ll put you on the
list for next Sunday Go with God

Anne notices that Jane and Marsh exchange a look before he
walks out

Off Jane seeing Anne has noticed her

INT LEVEL 4 DINING HALL - LATER
Nadia doesn’t eat Everyone’s a bit quieter than usual

Anne looks over at Jane’s table - Fischer has cloth wrapped
around her injured hands

ANNE
Why didn’t they stop her

DREADS
Anything goes in The Circle You
fight anywhere else you get The
Hole Most people wait ‘til Sunday

NADIA
No one’s died in a long time

DREADS
Maybe it was a show for the new
girl Make sure you know not to
step outta line

ANNE
Whose line

DREADS
Youre askin’ for somethin’ I
don’t know what but you’re askin’
for it Be careful

NADIA
(snickers)
Yeah Hole on your first week would
be a record
INT LEVEL 4 ANNE’S CELL - MORNING
Everyone files out Another day

Ramona and her THUGS push Anne back so she’s last to exit

Anne eyes the cell the Woman with contraband was taken from
earlier Gets an idea

The cell empties out But Anne doesn’t budge

MIRANDA
Let’s go newbie Slow is not a
pace that makes me happy

Anne doesn’t move
MIRANDA
(sigh)

It’s too early for this Reeves

No change

MIRANDA
(another sigh reports)
A little help in Cell Five

Miranda takes a step back as TWO GUARDS enter
Anne sizes them up quickly
THE FATTER GUARD broad-shouldered slight limp in left knee

THE SKINNY GUARD fingers unbutton baton on her belt chews
gum

They try to grab her

Anne slaps the SKINNY GUARD’S hand away - slips her BATON
out Knocks her in the face with her elbow

The baton goes right into FATTER GUARD’S knee She drops to
the ground

Elbow to the temple incapacitates her

Anne ducks SKINNY GUARD’S punch Grabs her -- slams her face
into a bunk

SKINNY GUARD bites her tongue Blood pours out of her mouth

Anne is about to knock MIRANDA down too when FOUR MORE GUARDS
tackle her

Finally Anne is subdued

ELEVATOR (PRELAP)
Level Seven

DING

INT THE HOLE - DARK
Anne falls hard on the concrete

A dixie cup with TWO YELLOW PILLS slides through the thin
slit at the bottom of the steel door

Footsteps outside disappear She’s alone In utter silence
Except for her own labored breaths
Her nose bleeds She wipes it swallows the YELLOW PILLS

Weak she slips to the floor Waits for the pain to subside

Her wheezing eases Her nose stops dripping blood

In the enveloping quiet and darkness comes a far away ROAR OF
AGONY It’s hollow muffled male

She holds her breathwaits for it again It never returns
Maybe just her imagination
The silence envelops her She closes her eyes

ANNE (PRELAP)
No I have never committed a crime

FADE TO

INT INTERVIEW ROOM - FLASHBACK

A slightly younger more innocent Anne sits giving her
ENTRANCE INTERVIEW

ANNE

I stole a strawberry once But I
was a child You know when you’re
an innocent child the entire world
seems like it’s for you And I
remember seeing this beautiful
strawberry I’d never seen one
before Have you ever tried to
explain a strawberry to a child
It’s impossible You can describe
it all you want It’s red The only
fruit with its seeds on the
outside Kinda tastes like bitter
sugar But that’s not what it
is It’s just what draws you to it
So thinking it was just part of
the world I took it and bit into
it

(chuckles)
The grocer was so angry he slapped
me

INT THE HOLE - NOW

Anne crawls to the slit at the bottom of the door A tiny
source of light

She pushes her face up to the gap tries to get any kind of
bearing It’s impossible to see anything

DERANGED MUTTERING floats out of a neighboring cell

ANNE
Hello Hello

The DERANGED MUTTERING slows to silence

ANNE
Beth
(silence)
Beth Is that you

The DERANGED MUTTERING resumes

FADE TO

INT INTERVIEW ROOM - FLASHBACK

ANNE

That’s why I’m here I know it
soundsI don’t know I want to be
a part of something that’s trying
to make the world like that again
Does that sound naive When you’re
a child evil doesn’t exist All
you see when you look out is “the
world” It’s benign And it’s
beautiful

(pause)
But we’re not children anymore Are
we

Anne listens to the interviewer

ANNE
The strawberry
(smirks)
It was the best thing I’d ever
tasted

INT THE HOLE - NOW
BLINDING LIGHT
THE HALLWAY

The openness of sound is painful as Anne’s pushed out in
chains She holds her ears Glances back at a row of cells

Fingertips stick out of one

Just before being pushed on she sees the prisoner’s slim
finger point down at the floor

INT SOLITARY REC ROOM - LATER
A barren concrete space
Anne sweats as she does pull-ups on a welded pull-up bar
Outside the window a GUARD observes Checks her WATCH
GUARD
Alright time’s up Put your back
to the door Reeves

Anne just keeps doing pull-ups

GUARD
Reeves Back to the door exercise
time is up

Anne ignores her keeps pulling

The GUARD sighs and gestures for ANOTHER GUARD

They storm the room Anne gets in a few punches before they
put her down

INT THE HOLE - LATER

Anne is thrown in

When the Guards’ footsteps disappear Anne scurries on all
fours to the slit at the base of the door

In the sliver of light we see her newly bruised and bloodied
face

She pulls out the Guard’s WATCH She must’ve taken it during
the tussle

She edges the watch out the slit uses its face as a mirror

ANNE
C’mon

A door down the hall opens Anne hears
Chains trailing Heavy dragging
She angles the watch face to see

An UNCONSCIOUS GIRL in chains is dragged by TWO GUARDS In
place of the prison jumpsuit a hospital gown

The gown hikes up - reveals 4th degree frostbite on her leg
and foot her skin just black and swollen and red Her
bleeding blisters leave a smear of puss and blood outside
Anne’s door

Anne edges the watch face furthercatches the reflection of
a PRETTY NURSE She has a deep scar across her face from
forehead to jaw

The Pretty Nurse’s eyes lock on Anne’s in the reflection
Anne quickly retreats
LATER

Anne sits against the wall The silence is unbearable The
kind that drives you insane

Finally

WHISPER
(faint)
Annnnnnnnne

Anne holds her breath Listens Just when she thinks she has
gone crazy --
44
WHISPER
Anne
Anne spins falls --
A BLONDE GIRL stands over her with a SYRINGE Her hair is wet
and she shivers like she’s freezing But instead of dripping
water a pool of blood forms at her feet

Anne backs to the corner afraid --

ANNE
Beth

The BLONDE GIRL raises the syringe like a knife and jams it
hard into Anne’s neck

SECONDS LATER

Light pierces the darkness to find Anne crouched in the
corner SCREAMING She’s not even taking a breath

NIT HOSPITAL WING LEVEL 2

Anne slowly opens her eyes to find a NURSE pulling a needle
out of her arm

She becomes alert fast Takes in the room

DR MARSH
Fear is a chemical reaction in the
amygdala of your brain It’s not
real

Marsh is at a holographic monitor typing notes
Anne tries to move - she’s strapped to the bed

DR MARSH
They’ re for your protection

ANNE
What did you put in me

Marsh nods to the Nurse She leaves
DR MARSH
It was just a vitamin boost

He checks his stethoscope against her chest

DR MARSH
You feel weak

Anne ignores him takes stock of the room Looks like
normal hospital room

DR MARSH
Because you’ve been unconscious for
the last 28 hours You haven’t
eaten a thing A normal human body
would be weak disoriented

He watches her casing him and the room

DR MARSH
Headaches Nausea

ANNE
I’m fine
DR MARSH
(interested)

Yes I see
He gently applies a salve to the cuts on her face

DR MARSH
The Hole is a primitive form of
torture I don’t like it myself

Anne notices his cuffs stained black with blood

DR MARSH
But evidence tells us that there is
nothing more terrifying to a human
being than isolation “It is a
special way of being afraid” As
the poet Philip Larkin said

ANNE
He meant being nothing That’s most
terrifying

DR MARSH
Is it

ANNE
Am I fit to go

He stands Tosses her bandages Washes up

DR MARSH
I’m going to make sure you have
extra protein supplements for the
next three days But yes I think
you are “fit”

He hits an intercom button

DR MARSH
Nurse She’s ready
(to Anne)
You have a very strong mind Miss
Reeves
The NURSE returns with a FEMALE GUARD

DR MARSH
Move her up to Grade Orange watch
please

And he’s gone

HALLWAY

Anne is led out A standard-looking hospital

They pass rooms with flu patients etc All is normal until --

SCREAMING AND CRYING - a Woman is wheeled in strapped to a
gurney

Anne recognizes her -- the Woman who was taken away for
contraband

As she struggles strips of blood along her stomach seep
through her hospital gown

She breaks through a strap breaks her NURSE’S nose

Anne’s Nurse rushes to help

Her Guard presses her face-first into the wall

FEMALE GUARD
Don’t move You got me

She hurries to help the Nurse subdue the Woman
That’s when --

WHISPER
Go

What

WHISPER
Go

Anne books it She takes off down the hall --

WHISPER
Left

Anne takes a left It dead-ends at a locked door

WHISPER
Hide

Anne ducks behind a gurney

The locked door opens TWO NURSES walk out chatting They
miss Anne

WHISPER
The door

Anne rushes for the closing door -- slips in just as it
locks behind her

INT SICK BAY LEVEL 2

This is a very different place

More like a military hospital This section is built for
disaster and crisis not comfort

Just rows upon rows of beds some separated by pale curtains
Behind some misshapen silhouettes and eerie sounds of
suffering

Anne walks down the aisles barely able to understand what
she’s seeing So many patients sick in ways she’s never
seen

An EMACIATED MAN His body completely atrophied
On the Man’s shoulder - a US MARINE TATTOO Below that a

strange mark a circle with 2 pillars and a curved line
connecting them so it resembles an H

ae

Another patient -- covered in 3RD DEGREE BURNS On her arm
circle tattoo with an UPSIDE DOWN ARROW
Another -- a SICK MAN sobs as he vomits INKY BLOOD His veins

are all black

Arms thrash at a curtain a few beds over The curtain tears
off Reveals --

A WILD WOMAN Her body thrashes Her maw open wide as if
screaming without sound Her nose bleeds uncontrollably

ON HER ARM - a tattoo of the Greek letter PST inside a
circle

GUARD (OS)
Stop Stop right now and raise your
arms

Anne does as she’s told almost grateful at being caught so
she can get out of this nightmare

CUT TO

INT LEVEL 1 GUARD LIVING QUARTERS - BATHROOMS

Dirty mops across a feculent floor
Anne Dreads Fisher and a few others mop and clean

Anne is sallow and exhausted She stares daggers at the
GUARDS chatting outside the door

FISHER
I’d be careful if I were you

That sounds like a threat

FISHER
You get to The Hole means you on
their radar And if you thought The
Hole was bad then you don’t wanna
do anything to be on their minds

ANNE
Like Lily She get on their radar
She go somewhere worse than The
Hole

Fisher clams up Like she somehow slipped

ANNE
Where’d Lily go Fisher
Dreads casually gets between them protective
FISHER
Dreads I didn’t hear a dog
whistle
DREADS
Smelled a rat Whatcha ladies up
to
FISHER
Just givin’ the noob here some
advice
DREADS

Funny I didn’t know you were an
authority on more than how to suck
dick in dark alleys

FISHER
Bitch you better --

Fisher’s advance is stopped by a shiv against her rib cage

DREADS
I better what

Fisher backs away

FISHER
Watch your back

Fisher walks off

ANNE
Wait
(dammit )
You didn’t have to do that

DREADS
You’ re welcome

ANNE
She knows doesn’t she

Dreads tucks her shiv back into the lining of her pants

DREADS
What are you babbling --

ANNE
The Hole There’s something beneath
it

DREADS

The Hole’s the last level
Everybody knows that

ANNE
Everybody
(beat)
Don’t you feel it That there’s
something nobody’s talking about
That everyone’s afraid

Dreads looks at her sadly Anne’s losing it
DREADS
Why don’t you take a break I can

finish this side

Anne looks after Fisher wants to know her secrets

INT LEVEL 4 SHOWER
A large dark communal chamber Rubber floors with drains

Women stand in rows beneath shower heads in the ceiling

Anne spots a RAGGED BLONDE ahead Someone new And she has
the CIRCLE TATTOO with the Greek letter PSI on her shoulder

Anne loses sight of her is shoved into a different line
Anne spots the blonde again

Her back is to Anne She turns her face up into the shower
fall Everyone else cowers at the freezing water

nq

Then suddenly her eyes OPEN and stare right at Anne

t’s Beth

t takes all her strength not to run to her sister Anne
smiles but Beth doesn’t react

Like a vacant shell Beth just scans the room seeing
nothing then turns her face into the water again

NT LEVEL 4 ANNE’S CELL

Everyone crowds the door where an INMATE LIBRARIAN hands out
books and porn magazines from a cart

SPANISH WOMAN
Que es eso

INMATE LIBRARIAN
Stephen King-o Carrie It’s a
classic Classico Scary Ahhh
(beat)
It’s the only one left in Espanol
deal with it

Everyone distracted Anne sits next to Beth Holds her hand
Beth doesn’t even act like she feels it

ANNE
Beth Can you hear me

Beth just stares at nothing

ANNE
I’m getting you out of here We’re
going home

She gently sweeps Beth’s sweat-soaked hair behind her ear

ANNE
Jesus what did they do to you
Bethy

Beth scratches at her right arm obsessively It’s strange at
first but quickly becomes frightening as she digs bloody
streaks into her arm

ANNE
Beth stop Stop it What are you
doing
(tears coming)
Bethy stop it You’re okay You’ re
safe Please Beth stop

She forces Beth’s arms down Grabs a shirt off her bunk and
ties it around Beth’s bloody scratches

ANNE
(touches Beth’s face)
Baby Can you hear me

Beth just stares off emptily A body not a person

Anne checks her tears Someone has taken her sister

INT LEVEL 4 OUTSIDE JANE’S CELL

Fisher and CYBIL a Chinese thug with a shaved head flank
the cell

They get in Anne’s way as she approaches
ANNE
(to Fisher)

Tell me what’s going on

FISHER
Turn around And walk away

Anne is not in the mood

She grabs Fisher and slams her against the wall
Cybil goes after her -- Anne kicks her in the face

her down

ANNE
What are they doing to them down
there I know you know

Cybil is up Now with a SHIV

knocks

She charges Anne who swings Fisher around -- the shiv goes

right into her shoulder

Suddenly Jane is there -- her hand on Fisher and Cybil

They instantly back off

Jane nods to Cybil She instantly gets to dressing Fisher’s

flesh wound

A look around to make sure the Guards haven’t noticed them

then Jane gestures for Anne to follow her inside

JANE’S CELL

Walls are covered in 3D paintings of the outside world

Rivers city blocks life

Once inside Jane turns her back to Anne Stares
painting of a window on the back wall

ANNE
Where do they go when they’ re
taken
Jane doesn’t budge
ANNE
The mark on your arm What’s it
mean
SlowlyJane turns
ANNE

I know you have one too

Jane steadily closes the distance between them

at

ANNE
You protect the ones who come back
don’t you Because they did it to
you too

Jane is so close she breathes down on Anne now

ANNE
The girl Lily In The Circle You
let her die

JANE
(shakes her head)
I saved her life

Anne digests this

ANNE
I think they have my sister
(at Jane’s look)
Beth Olsen

There’s sadness in Jane’s eyes as she recognizes the name

ANNE
I want to know what they’re doing
to her

JANE

No you don’t

ANNE
I want to make them stop

Jane smirks Turns her back to Anne

On instinct Anne grabs her to stop her Jane REACTS and
slams Anne in the face with the force of a sledgehammer Anne
is on the floor in an instant with a bloody mouth

Jane backs off ashamed
Fisher is about to come in

Jane holds a hand out to stop her

Jane sighs She rolls up her sleeve to reveal the Circle
tattoo with 2 pillars and a curved line between them The
same Circle and H tattoo on the EMACIATED MAN

JANE
The Circle He watches

BURKE (0OS)
Tea party ladies

Burke is ready for a fight with Jane but Jane backs off

INT LEVEL 4 ANNE’S CELL - LIGHTS OUT

The Inmates take their BLUE PILLS from Burke and go to bed

Anne and Beth’s bunks are head to head She climbs up and
stares at her sister She’s already asleep

A million questions run through Anne’s mind

The INMATE LIBRARIAN stands in the corner with her carts and
crates of books

Anne peruses the options

INMATE LIBRARIAN
Looking for anything in particular

ANNE
I don’t know Symbology History

Her heart stops at a book spine with ASTROLOGICAL SYMBOLS
One of them is the UPSIDE DOWN ARROW

Anne snatches the book and finds a bench Flips through
Astrology and You finds a page with the upside down arrow

Vulcan a hypothetical planet once thought to exist inside

Where’s everyone else

Burke shoves Anne on

INT LEVEL 4 GUARD STATION - SAME

Anne’s RED DOT is led by a BLUE DOT away from the other RED
DOTS Led into a room where aSINGLE BLUE DOT waits

INT LEVEL 4 SHOWER
Burke shoves Anne inside locks the door quick

In the corner a male guard taps a stun stick against his
thigh WAKE is stitched to his shirt pocket

Wake emerges from the shadows the face of a real
sonofabitch

ANNE
Shit

WAKE
My name is John Wake

Wake approaches Slowly as if for effect Anne’s not
impressed

WAKE
There are cameras in the corners at
ten o’clock and five o’clock

Huh

WAKE
I’m not going to hurt you

He backhands Anne Shoves her into the wall His mouth is
right in her ear --

WAKE
Have you made contact with Beth

ANNE

Wake kicks Anne’s legs wide

WAKE
I don’t know when I’11 be able to
next make contact So tell me
quickly what intel you’ve acquired

Struggle

Anne pushes back
Wake slams her hard against the wall

WAKE
Good

He unbuckles his belt

ANNE
What the fuck are you doing

WAKE
Shut up We don’t have much time
Have you found her

Still shocked and confused but --

ANNE
Yes They just put her back in
general yesterday

This surprises Wake

WAKE
What has she told you

ANNE
Nothing They did something to her
The trauma - I think she might have
selective mutism It could take
months to undo We need to get her
out of here

He tugs at her pants

WAKE
Don’t be afraid

ANNE
I’m not afraid

The camera in the corner watches

Wake’s chin rests on Anne’s shoulder as they struggle against
each other It’s mortifying even if it is just an act

WAKE
I’m sorry
(beat)
What intel have you gathered of
Ravensbrook’s operations

ANNE
I don’t know I think they’re
experimenting on prisoners

WAKE
You think To what end

ANNE
I don’t know Can you get us out of
here

WAKE

Focus Agent Reeves I’m asking you
to report

ANNE

(breathes thinks)
I saw chemical burns A lot of sick
people Like I’ve never seen

(realizes)
Weapons experiments Right If
Global Lucent’s developing weapons
for Russia they could be new
biological and chemical WMDs What
better place to test them than on a
population nobody cares about

WAKE
Can you prove it

ANNE
Whatever they’re doing is in Beth’s
head She’s seen it

WAKE
And she’s mute

ANNE
She just needs help We need an
extraction now

WAKE
I don’t think so

Wake shoves her head into the wall She crumples to the
floor

He steps back and buckles his pants which he never really
took down

WAKE
I’m not risking this mission
because you hope your sister will
return to reality You prove she
knows something or you find proof
yourself That’s when we talk
extraction

ANNE
Are you insane You have to pull us
out

WAKE
You better start crying

A METALLIC GROAN from outside

No Wait

She presses against the clear gate Tries to find Beth as the
lights go out around the prison
INT LEVEL 4 DINING HALL

Anne is out of it A new resolve or hate in her eyes She
pays no attention to Dreads and Nadia’s idle talk

She examines the room instead eyeing inmates

The crazies Did something make them crazy

The strangely scarred Torture scars Medical scars Fights
Jane with her lackeys

ANNE
When did Jane go to The Hole
Dreads and Nadia stop mid-conversation

NADIA

NADIA
Almost 10 months Longest I ever
seen someone go to the Hole and
come back

ANNE
Some don’t come back

NADIA
You’ve been there

DREADS
Those that do usually come back

Dreads and Nadia share a look

DREADS
How do you know about Beth

ANNE
They took her again Last night
For no reason Why would they do

Now Nadia also shares Dreads’ concern for Anne’s sanity

ANNE
(gathers her thoughts)
Jane never went to The Hole

DREADS
Here we go

ANNE
You were right

DREADS
About what

ANNE
Neither of you should ever mess
with Jane

Anne dumps her food bars onto Dreads’s plate Stands Takes

ANNE
To find out where she did go

Anne walks up to Jane’s tablebut then passes it Still it
draws Jane’s attention

Jane watches Anne walk right up to

senses her but finishes her story anyway

Finally she turns ready to curse the fuck out of --

The word “challenge” whispers through the room fast

INMATE
There’s been a challenge

INT LEVEL 4 REC COURTYARD

Anne rises Lowers Rises We see her only at the top of her
push-ups

She senses danger Several INMATES nonchalantly take a stance
around her intimidating others nearby to walk off

She keeps doing push-ups as several MORE appear They’re
starting to form a circle around her

Finally a pair of feet stop inches from Anne’s face
It’s Jane
She kneels so only Anne can hear her

JANE
Be noticed

ANNE
Thank you

JANE
She said you would come That you
were like her
(beat)
I prayed you were not

Don’t thank me

Wake is among the guards shuffling in excitedly making bets
He tries to hide his concern

MALE GUARD 1
Yeah but Wake’s got dibs He had
her first

MALE GUARD 2
You wanna sell her Wake

WAKE
(forced smile)
Not a chance

MALE GUARD 1
She’s not gonna win anyway Look at
that gang banger bitch She looks
like she’d kill both of you then
bite off your cocks when you’ re
dead just to make your soul cry

GUARD STATION

BURKE

Marsh steps up to the window greets the Warden A GUARD hits
a few buttons on her keyboard and two screens pop up with
Anne’s profile and stats on one Ramona’s on the other

Marsh gives the go-ahead nod to

-- who walks to the center of the blood-stained mat Right
between Ramona and Anne

BURKE
Today we have one grievance That
between Ramona Esperanza and Anne
Reeves It will be settled here as
agreed by both parties yes

RAMONA
Hell yeah
Anne nods

She glances at Jane who looks up at Marsh “Be noticed”

Anne knows what she has to do --

BURKE
Begin

Burke steps out

Ramona charges

IN ONE MOVE - Anne sidesteps elbows Ramona in the jaw bends

her arm back snaps it

And there’s a momentwhere Anne looks down at Ramona her

life entirely in Anne’s hands

FLASHBACK

7-YEAR-OLD BETH with her rifle Smiles excitedly over at 8-

YEAR-OLD ANNE

Beth smiles innocent at her Entrance Interview
BETH

I see the Agency as this great
light This great light in the
darkness

FLASHBACK

Beth staring A body not a person

BACK TO THE CIRCLE

Anne brings her foot down and crushes Ramona’s head
death

Silence
Anne looks up at Marsh

Marsh smirks and exits

Instant

Jane looks at Anne with a new kind of dread There’s no
turning back now

INT GUARDS QUARTERS “WINNER’S CIRCLE”

Anne’s thrown in The room is empty but for a plush bed and
an elegant wet bar with a food basket

Wake enters locks the door

ANNE
What are you doing here

WAKE
Are you out of your fucking mind

ANNE
I thought I was going to Marsh

WAKE
Marsh What do you think just
happened here

ANNE
got his attention

WAKE

You got everyone’s attention
That’s one hell of a way to call a
meeting This is a recon mission

ANNE
didn’t mean to call it with you
Where’s Marsh

WAKE

Highest bidder gets the winner In
return they get certain
“amenities” I think I was the only
one who knew you’d win

The gift basket and bed suddenly make sense

ANNE
I need to get down there Wake
They’ ve taken Beth

WAKE
Is that what this is about

She let it slip This is personal

ANNE
Look Throughout history doctors
have used prisoners for
experimentation to test biological
andchemical weapons The Nazis
Japanese Koreans Hell we’ve done
it If that’s what Marsh is up to
for the Russians then we need to
know And the only way to do that
is to go see for myself
(beat)
If Beth has been tested on she’s
living evidence We need her
(trying to convince
herself)
This isn’t personal

She starts wheezing

ANNE
What level are we on

Wake digests all this Knows Anne is right

WAKE
We need more than just Beth Bring
me data
(beat)
I can’t help you down there

Anne’s nose starts to bleed

WAKE
Send me proof Then I can get you
an extraction

ANNE
You can get me down there

Anne wipes her bloody nose

ANNE
(fading)

WAKE
I won’t need to

Wake just watches her stumble back She gasps for breath He
just watches

As she’s about to pass out he opens the door to reveal the
PRETTY NURSE and ANOTHER NURSE already waiting

INT WARD 8 CELL BLOCK
Anne wakes in a black-walled room

Her wrist locator is gone But in its place just under the
skin a tiny BLINKING RED LIGHT

What the fuck - She claws at it

She looks out the wall of glass in front of her tries to get
her bearings --

OUTSIDE THE CELL - we see she’s one of a whole row of similar
black-walled cells It’s like an empty zoo and she’s the
only caged animal

Her training overcomes fear -- she takes in the room
- Camera in the corner

- Smooth ceiling

- She bounces a little feels heavier

ANNE
We’ re lower than the Hole

- Her arm the red blinking light

INT LEVEL 4 ANNE’S CELL - FLASHBACK

Beth scratches at her arm leaving furious marks

Anne checks her shoulder No tattoo
A DOOR OPENS off

Dr Marsh flanked by TWO NURSE GUARDS (yes armed nurses)
appears He smiles warmly

DR MARSH
I must admit Anne that when we
first met I did not expect to see
you here

He scans his tablet

DR MARSH
Ramona Esperanza Broken nose
three broken ribs and neck that’s
facing the wrong way Very precise
work for a travel agent

He glances at her amusement dancing in his eyes

DR MARSH
But what I found most fascinating
was that throughout the ordeal
your heart rate was perfectly
steady

ON HIS TABLET - real-time diagnostics of Anne as video of The
Circle fight plays on his screen

DR MARSH
A fantastic example of mind
controlling matter I would say
(smiles)

Anne plunges into a tank of freezing water Her arms and legs

are cuf

back to

fed with weights She surfaces shivering spitting up
she can through a mouth guard She tilts her head
breathe above water

Marsh stands to the side with monitors and an AIDE

Fahrenheit

Marsh eyes Anne closely Her shivering gets worse He looks

like he

s hoping for a miracle

AIDE

Everything looks normal no signs
of hypothermic aptitude

Anne tries to control her erratic breathing

DR MARSH
Good girl

He walks right up to the glass to better observe her

AIDE
Body temp at 89 degrees Fahrenheit

DR MARSH
You feel it don’t you The mild
confusion

DR MARSH (CONTD)
Your vital organs can’t function at
these temperatures so your body
diverts blood from the less
necessary parts of your body Toes
Fingers

(beat)

Fascinating isn’t it The extent
your body is willing to sacrifice
to save the whole

He’s talking more about her than about her body
She looks at him now Stares deep into him

Marsh smiles like a proud father He knows the amount of
control that takes

DR MARSH
Take her down to 80

AIDE
Risk losing the subject on the
first test

Marsh stomps back to the monitors

DR MARSH
Do it

The Aide lowers the temp

A pain-filled tear runs down Anne’s face

Marsh takes a proud breath relieved He hits the intercom

DR MARSH
Extraction please
He pats the Aide excited

Doors open and four large MALE NURSE GUARDS enter to pull
Anne out like she’s no more fragile than a sack of bricks

As she’s conveyed out the familiar FLAT-LINE SOUND

DR MARSH
No

DISSOLVE TO

Wooden walls and floors Like a giant steam room

Anne’s naked body on the ground covered in sweat A tube
pumps a CLEAR LIQUID down Anne’s throat

She jolts upright vomits Pulls the tube out gags as she
drags out more and more tube Finally it’s out and she’s on
all fours coughing up

INT WARD 8 EXAMINATION ROOM

A sterile frightening place devoid of humanity

Anne’s limbs are cuffed to the cold metal table Marsh
examines her frostbitten body with no bedside matter

Done he throws a gown over her

He jots notes on his TABLET doesn’t look pleased

DR MARSH
How’s the pain On a scale of 1-10
10 being unbearable

She tries to speak It hurts

DR MARSH
Shh Not yet

A second before she understands then holds up 7 fingers
He nods Makes a note

He prepares something at a table off Returns with a CLEAR
SERUM She struggles

DR MARSH
This will help the pain
(gently)

Trust me
He means it Anne has no choice but to let him inject her

He strokes her forehead as her EYES ROLL BACK and she passes
into a drug-induced oblivion

A NURSE GUARD leads a shackled Anne down a cellblock that
looks part psych-ward part prison One prisoner per cell
And on each door asign illumes a different symbol

Through the windows of each door Anne spies glimpses of the
patient-prisoners

A MAN long black hair deathly pale skin stands in the far
corner singing to himself A straight-jacket keeps him bound

On his door THE SYMBOL OF HADES

ANNE SCREAMS

PRETTY NURSE tightens her restraints Anne writhes on a
table desperate to be free

DR MARSH
Hold her

He forces a tube down her throat BLACK SERUM pumps into her
With the Pretty Nurse’s help he forces Anne to swallow
Marsh gets behind his holographic computer

Anne’s body spasms

PRETTY NURSE
Doctor --

Anne’s skin thins For a moment we see her veins muscles

PRETTY NURSE
You gave her the Clear

DR MARSH
Of course

Marsh rushes to Anne’s side
The pain is so severe she fades in and out of consciousness

PRETTY NURSE
Well it’s not taking

DR MARSH
(whispers to Anne)
We are the stuff of stars you
know But even the Universe cannot
exist unless you perceive it

PRETTY NURSE
We’ re losing her

Marsh leans close to Anne strokes her hair gently

DR MARSH
Believe Use your mind You are not
dying Pain is an illusion You
exist because you believe you do

Anne closes her eyes tight to get through the pain

A MAN sits on his bed head bowed His arms and legs are
bound with thick cuffs On his door THE SYMBOL OF HERCULES

SYMBOL OF BOREAS (God of Winter)

NURSE GUARDS carry a screaming Anne into the room Her body
is covered in 3rd degree burns and blisters

Anne approaches a cell whose window LIGHTS UP then goes
cold as if someone inside is turning on and off a bright
orange light

Anne passes the cellTHE SYMBOL OF VULCAN on the door

INT WARD 8 EXAMINATION ROOM

Anne wakes to find her body swaddled in a cold wrap Her face
is red and blistered like she’s been given an acute sunburn

Marsh’s voice is distant blurry

DR MARSH
(to his Aide annoyed)
No She didn’t respond to any of
those treatments There’s only some
slightly accelerated healing after
the Clear Serum

He shakes his head Like none of this makes sense to him

AIDE
Should we put her back in General
with the other fails then

Marsh really examines the data on his TABLET Thinking

Marsh looks back at Anne He hands the Tablet to the Aide We
catch a glimpse of video of Anne in her Level 4 cell

DR MARSH
Prep her for the Blue

Sir I thought we agreed there’s
still work to be done with the
blues after the last --

DR MARSH
Do it

FADE TO

Inside Vulcan’s cell SCORCH MARKS on the walls

And a MAN standing naked back to the door We can’t see
what he’s doing but the source of the orange light is in his
hands as if he’s lighting something on fire then putting it
out lights it puts it out

The AIDE swabs Anne’s arm INJECTS A BLUE SERUM This makes
him nervous

Anne’s passed out on the table He tightens her restraints

Anne and Beth sit together holding hands

BETH
How do you feel

ANNE
My heart -- my heart is racing

Beth nods the feeling familiar to her

BETH
It slows Or you stop noticing
And the headache

Anne nods

BETH
That doesn’t go away

What is it

BETH
I don’t know But ever since
nothing’s been right Nothing at
all It’s justfuzzy Like a
painting left out in the rain

They sit in silence a moment

BETH
I knew they’d send you

Anne looks suddenly ashamed

BETH
But I didn’t know if you’d come

ANNE
Of course I came I’m getting you
out of here

BETH
That’s not your mission

I don’t care

BETH
No You never have

Anne tears up

I got him to give up his father I
betrayed the Agency then I
betrayed him

BETH
Because of what I said

ANNE
(yes)
It doesn’t matter

BETH
Oh Annie

ANNE
You’re all I have left I’m not
leaving you

BETH
You can’t stop everything bad in
the world from happening Sometimes
the bad things need to happen for
the good things to be

Anne takes this in Then suddenly --impossibly-- she hears
FOOTSTEPS outside And a MUFFLED VOICE hard to make out

BETH
What is it
Anne is confused by how she knows this but

ANNE
It’s him He’s coming

BETH
Forget about me If you can save
yourself

Are you okay Did they hurt you

ANNE
We’ re going to die here

BETH
No You’re not dying here you

They’ ve created the perfect prison

(taps her head)
Like children our lives are
entirely in their hands They can
inject us with that black stuff and
we could be dead in a minute if
they just say “yes” when yesterday
they said “no We depend on them
And they’re lunatics

”

BETH
They’ re getting into your head

ANNE

No they’re IN my head I can hear
hem Or things I don’t know
What’s wrong with me

Beth watches her sister break down Watches her bow to the
ground and we hear just FLASHES OF SOUND -- chains manic
yelling cell doors locking Dr Marsh’s voicescreaming
Sobbing Pleading People dying

She covers her ears tries to stop the cacophony

-But all there really is is SILENCE It’s all in her head

When you feel like it’s hopeless
what do you do Anne What do you
do

ANNE
Start with what you know

she’s too focused to let it overwhelm her now

werethe upside down arrow The
book said that was Vulcan

You come from a world that expects
you to be a cog I am telling you
You can be more than that

(on intercom)
No It’s a collection of molecules
Of energy set in a pattern that our
mind interprets as “table” “Wood”
But I have given you an
extraordinary gift Anne

(beat)
The gift of mind over matter

Anne looks at the table Wonders

DR MARSH
You are the only one to survive the
Serum of Psyche Everyone else has
lost their minds

Anne knows he refers to Beth

DR MARSH
I’m telling you you can move that
table without touching it Break it
into pieces if you wanted

ANNE
You’re insane

DR MARSH
The world could be yours just like
youve always wanted Wouldn’t you
like that

Something in her actually does but --

recorded

ANNE
You’re a murderer and a traitor I
would like you to pay for your
crimes

DR MARSH

(almost angry)
Stop pretending you’re one of them
You’re not your sister You’re not
other people You never were And
now your physiology proves it And
once you believe it yourself no
one will be able to deny it To
deny you Are Special

(beat)
Don’t you see Anne I’m finally
asking what do you want

To kill you

Anne’s asleep by the door

A tray of food SLIPS through the door wakes her The tray
door remains open

ANNE

Where’s Beth What have you done

with her
The tray door closes
Anne thinks Flexes her hands dares to believe
She steps right up to the door Concentrates on it
-and IT OPENS
Holy shit did she just do that

She creeps up to the doorpeeks out

CELL BLOCK HALLWAY

RED LIGHT LOCK INDICATORS above a half dozen cells in the
cellblock suddenly turn green
She didn’t do it Some of the doors are just unlocking
As those cell doors slowly open an ALARM BLARES

Anne is about to make a run for it but then senses
somethingand ducks

Her own cell door EXPLODES off its hinges - narrowly misses
taking her head off

A man wide as the doorway stands heaving with adrenaline
On his arm the H TATTOO

This is HERCULES if the demigod was insane with rage and
testosterone

He charges -- impossible speed -- slams Anne into the wall
Concrete crashes around them in shards

Herc gets up easily his body unaffected

Anne is cut up aches all over

As she gets to her feet Herc find a heavy slab of concrete
and he HURLS IT like a tennis ball

She’s smashed to the ground again

His massive hands find her neck choke her to an inch of life
in seconds

Anne’s head is forced back - she sees the TWISTED DOOR She
focuses tries to move it It quivers or did it

She tries to pry Herc’s hand loose He’s too strong --

-- back to the door She’s about to die At that thought --
the DOOR FLIES AT HERCULES smashes him back

Anne gasps for life can’t believe what she’s done but can’t
stop now -- she gets up smashes her foot down on the door
crushing Herc’s head She smashes down again and again

Until blood runs onto the concrete and the giant is dead

No time --

She sneaks to the open doorway looks out the hall is empty
SOUNDS OF CHAOS from beyond another corridor

Anne takes off in the opposite direction

END OF THE HALL

The seamless door to the next corridor requires a KEY CARD

Anne looks back -- a few escaped PATIENT-PRISONERS stalk
towards her One has the VULCAN TATTOO

She backs to the door no escape
Then - Anne falls to her knees in extreme pain

The door opens and a NURSE GUARD emerges his REMOTE pointed
at her

He sees the others coming Clicks it at them too
They fall Pain
The NURSE GUARD steps over Anne

NURSE GUARD
The doctor’s going to be so
disappointed

He lifts his WALKIE TALKIE to his lips - but suddenly drops
it Then the REMOTE

Anne is instantly released from pain

The NURSE GUARD’S skin pales lips turn blue The moisture in
his hair on his skin FREEZES

Behind him - a girl with icy wet hair pale blue eyes --
presses her hand against the Nurse Guard’s back

It’s BOREAS

And she’s freezing him

Anne snatches the fallen REMOTE She hurries through the now
open door locks it behind her -- just as BOREAS’S PALE FACE
smashes against the window

BOREAS
Open the door Open the dooooor
You’re next You hear me

Anne’s confused by her blood lust

But there’s no time -- she runs off

INT WARD 8 CORRIDOR

Anne runs down a row of hospital rooms just to find herself
in another similar corridor She’s lost

ANNE
Goddammit

TWO NURSE GUARDS round the corner weapons drawn

Anne finds the nearest thing she can throw - a chair - and
heaves it at Guard 1 on the right

She rushes Guard 2 as the other goes down

Guard 2 is on the ground and disarmed before Guard 1 can
get to his feet The deft work of a SERE-trained soldier

Anne points his partner’s gun right at him

ANNE
Drop it

Guard 1 drops his gun

ANNE
Slide it over here

He kicks it over

ANNE
You Over there with him
(then)
Where’s Marsh’s office

She notices Guard 1 smiling

ANNE
What’s funny

GUARD 1
You

Guard 2 with his hands up seems to be taking Anne pretty
seriously

The emergency lights are on leaving an eerie blue glow But
no whispers

Anne turns and runs right into the pale face of HADES His

Before Anne can get her REMOTE he grabs her arm A snake of

She SEIZES INSTANTLY unable to breathe or move --

He likes the way she looks dying

Anne looks around for something Anything She sees the
sprinklers overhead

HADES
You die so easily This isn’t even
a challenge Why does Marsh think
you’re so special
She closes her eyes tight --
The sprinkler overhead EXPLODES It startles him he lets

Anne punches him on the inside of the knee dropping him
Then takes off running back to Marsh’s office

She explodes hospital windows behind her as she goes It
slows Hades just enough for Anne to get into the --

NEXT CORRIDOR

She locks the door behind her

go

Through the window she sees Hades turn the corner stringy
black hair wet cuts peppering his face He smiles
HADES
(sings eerily)
Hush little baby don’t say a word

Daddy’s gonna cut you and make you
hurt

Anne elbows the KEY CARD lock smashing it She returns to
Marsh’s office

She focuses on the door - it’s too heavy for her telekinesis

She scopes for resources An ULTRASOUND MACHINE is plugged in
down the hall

Anne unplugs it
Breaks the plug off the end Pulls out wiring
MARSH’S DOOR

Anne uses a makeshift lockpick on the door

INT MARSH’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

The office from her vision

She enters 4776 into the keypad on the wall

The bookshelf slides open reveals the SECRET ROOM
SECRET ROOM

All the SERUMS are here Even the YELLOW (Herc) and SILVER
(Boreas) that we haven’t seen used before

Anne throws a few of each in a backpack slings it over her
shoulder

Anne gets on his COMPUTER

She pulls up an inmate list Finds Beth’s name

BETH REEVES (aka OLSEN) - MATERNITY WARD

ANNE
Maternity Ward

INTERNED 78 DAYS
TREATMENT PSYCHE and HERA
She clicks on the NOTES icon

DR MARSH (VO)
The initial Psyche Serum failed
and seems to have induced a state
of mental instability in the
patient However upon the arrival
of her sister it became clear that
deep underneath the psychosis is
the ability to teleproject

A video pops up
ON VIDEO
It’s CCTV footage of Anne in her cell on Level 4

ANNE
(on video)
Jesus what did they do to you
Bethy

ON VIDEO - Anne’s hands press through the air like she’s
trying to hold an invisible person down There is no Beth

DR MARSH (VO)
The prisoner Anne Reeves whom we
later learned to be the patient’s
sister exhibited no telepathic
abilities of her own but Beth
seems to be able to appear to her
sister and thus far only her
sister as though real However if
you observe closely it appears
Beth could only appear ina
weakened state

ANNE
(on video)
Beth stop Stop it
(MORE)
ANNE (CONTD)
What are you doing Bethy stop it
You’re okay You’re safe Please
Beth stop

DR MARSH (VO)
However the channel seemed to get
clearer with proximity

Another video footage of Anne in her Ward 8 cell
ANNE She can’t believe what she’s seeing here
She types in her own name

VIDEO PLAYS of Anne in the Assessment Room

DR MARSH (VO)
Just two days after the Psyche
Serum was administered the patient
is not only of sound mind but
already exhibiting encouraging
signs of telepathy
(beat)

It is my belief she may be our
first true Hopeful

ANNE
(on video)
You’re a murderer and a traitor I
would like you to pay for your
crimes

Marsh doesn’t respond His lips don’t even move
ANNE
(on video)
To kill you

ANNE steps away from the screen in disbelief

ANNE
Son of a bitch

Needs a minute to process So she’s a telepath

Then she gets an idea She closes her eyes

No Beth

ANNE
Okay Beth can you hear me
She goes silent
ANNE (VO)
Bethtell me where you are Help

me find you

SHOT - looking up through a clear tube Up at an ODD PAINTING
on the ceiling

SHOT - our hands in pink liquid

SHOT - double swinging doors with the SYMBOL OF HERA (circle
like a sun on top of a cross)

Anne opens her eyes Has seen where to go

INT WARD 8

Anne comes to a corridor that dead ends at the DOUBLE
SWINGING DOORS

INT MATERNITY WARD

A huge circular room with PODS around the edges

On the ceiling a painting of the HERA SYMBOL

All the women are in some kind of forced stasis Their stats
project on the glass windows of the tubes containing them
Their bodies lay in some kind of pink viscous fluid

At the foot of each bed a symbol shows the combination
attempted here (ie Hercules Boreas)

ANNE
Oh my god They’re breeding them

Then Anne sees --

ANNE
Beth

The symbol at the foot of Beth’s bed PSI PSI

Anne scrolls through the readings on her glass Comes to a
live ultrasound of a 2-month old fetus

Beth’s face is serene but bruised sallow It’s
heartbreaking to see her sister this way

ANNE
Beth can you hear me I’m getting
you out of here You understand me

She looks desperately for a way to unplug Beth
But then senses something Someone’s coming

She finds a command on Beth’s pod the cover pulls back She
drags Beth to the floor just as

HADES
Stop hiding little dovelette

He strolls in

HADES
Oooh what kind of sick place have
we here

He sees the empty pod But no Anne

HADES
Dovelette

He looks under the empty pod - Beth is there covered in the
pink gel No Anne

HADES
I am told That you’re my ticket
out of here

Hades stands over Beth not quite sure what he’s looking at
Beth’s fingers twitch
Hades looks around for Anne He checks hiding spots

HADES
I killed 9 people to get thrown
down here Funny how things work I
make it an even 10 I go home
(MORE)

HADES (CONTD)
(laughs)
Simon says show yourself

Hades senses someone behind him He turns to see

BETH stands before him like a demonic apparition Her eyes
are completely white

HADES
What the

He turns back -- Beth’s body is still by the pod So how can
she be --

He looks back and VISION BETH is right in his face
Hades freaks stumbles back against Beth’s pod

HADES
Jesus Christ

Anne REACHES across the pod and pulls Hades into it He
reacts fast - grabs her hand poisoning her instantly

Anne bears into the sudden pain can’t reach the IV - focuses
and the IV moves on its own plunges its needle into him

Hades’s inky poison courses through Anne’s body She just
barely has the strength to activate the IV - it pumps PINK
SERUM into Hades

At first there’s no effect As Anne’s eyes blacken and her
throat closes

THEN Hades screams -- his black veins turn red His skin
bruises instantly as ALL HIS VEINS BURST

Red blood drips from his eyes and nose his body convulses
and finally he dies

Anne crumples to the floor Her eyes are black with poison

Across the floor Beth coughs up pink liquid comes to As
one sister returns to life the other fades

Beth opens her eyes to see Anne dying She just stares
There’s an emptiness behind her eyes

DR MARSH (VO)
Believe Use your mind You are not
dying Pain is an illusion

A momentthen

ANNE’S BLACK EYES slowly fade to green It takes effort but
it’s as if she’s willing her body to reject the poison

The black in her veins recedes
She crawls over to Beth

ANNE
Beth Beth can you hear me
(it doesn’t seem like it)
Hang onto me Beth Hang onto me

INT WARD 8 - LATER

A NURSE GUARD reports into his walkie talkie

NURSE GUARD
Corridor Four clear Psyche Patient
451 has the girl Hades Patient 327
is down in the Hera Ward over

He cocks his pistol

As he walks down the hall towards us we see Anne and Beth
hiding behind the next corner

Beth whimpers -- Anne presses her hand over her mouth

As he rounds the corner Anne GRABS his gun hand It’s as if
she can hear his thoughts because she predicts his every
move dodging effortlessly as if sensing it before it
happens

She sweep kicks his legs out from under him and breaks his
wrist back as he goes down Gun falls She has another
already right in his face

INT WARD 8 ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Anne holds the Nurse Guard at gunpoint
Beth stands in the corner spaced out

ANNE
Take us to the top

NURSE GUARD
You really think this is going to
work

Anne concentrates - the Nurse Guard’s throat contracts He

can’t breathe Can’t move

ANNE
Top floor

She lets him go
NURSE GUARD
(coughing)
Surface Level
“Voice Recognized H Little” appears on the scanner

The elevator ascends

NURSE GUARD
You don’t get it do you

Anne ignores him Checks on Beth watches the scanner
out their ascension

NURSE GUARD
You’re the Hopeful He’11l never let
you leave

ANNE
A Hopeful What does that mean

NURSE GUARD
It means maybe he finally did it
Created a God

He laughs like a fated man

NURSE GUARD
Thing is this place was built to
keep gods in

count

The elevator comes to a crashing halt The Nurse Guard makes
his move -- grabs the gun is about to shoot

Anne ducks and CLENCHES HER FIST - it causes the gun to crush
in his hands She slams him into the wall

He slumps to the floor unconscious

ELEVATOR
Authorities have been alerted
Please remain where you are
INT LEVEL 2 - SICK BAY
Anne forces the elevator doors open She helps Beth out
By the time she climbs out too Beth is gone

ANNE
Beth Beth

She rounds the corner

BOREAS
Is this what you’re looking for

BOREAS stands on Beth’s back pinning her to the floor
At the touch Beth is freezing to death

BOREAS
Pretty cool huh Just from
moisture in the air I can feel it
It’s suffocating

ANNE
Let her go

BOREAS
Don’t Don’t talk to me like that
Show me your arm Your mark Show
it to me

Anne lifts her sleeve

ANNE
Please just let her go

BOREAS
She has the mark too Maybe I’m
supposed to kill both of you
(beat)
What does that mark even mean

She nudges the PSI TATTOO on Beth’s shoulder

ANNE
Don’t

Boreas looks down at Beth Hypothermia has set in

BOREAS
She’s dying

Behind Boreas Anne sees Jane sneaking up with a PIPE

BOREAS
I can almost feel daylight on my
skin again I want you to die do
you understand I’ve never wanted
anything more

Boreas sees Beth dying Releases her to come after Anne now --

Before she can Jane knocks her in the head with the pipe A
SICKENING CRACK

Boreas falls dead
With Boreas gone the ice melts around Beth
Anne instantly hugs Beth into her arms to warm her

ANNE
(to Jane)
Thank you

JANE
The guards are distracted trying to
find the other patients If you’re
to get out with your sister you
need to go now

GILL-OXYGEN GENERATOR and HYDROGEN-COOLED TUBE

And finally to the door MAINTENANCE ROOM

INT LEVEL

2 MAINTENANCE ROOM

Divers suits hang on the wall A TWO-MAN SUBMARINE floats in
a pool of water that leads to the ocean

JANE
The decompression pills should be
in here

She breaks open the lock on a medicine cabinet with the ease
normal people use to open Coke cans

Jane stops

JANE
They need divers to maintain the
exterior So we can take the same
route they do all the way to the
top

ANNE
What did he offer you

JANE
You’re strong Stronger than she
was Beth could never read
thoughts

ANNE
How long have you been working with
him

JANE
I just keep my eye out For
Hopefuls It’s the price I pay

ANNE
(gets it)
To stay out of the Ward

BETH
(oblivious)
Hot

ANNE
And he offered you freedom if you
could kill me

JANE
I wish I could believe we would all
make it together But he controls
everything This thing in our
bodies - we’re his Anne

She shows Anne a vicious scar on her forearm

JANE
I tried digging it out once
(beat)
It doesn’t come out

BETH
It’s hot

ANNE
You don’t really believe he’1ll give
you your life back Jane you know
it would never be that easy

JANE
This isn’t easy But I have no
other choice but to trust him

BETH
It’s hot

A second -- then Anne gets it

She grabs Beth and throws her away from the door just as it
warps and twists Anne’s reflection into grotesque shapes

It’s melting

With Anne distracted Jane takes a swing with her PIPE -- it
knocks Anne back breaks a rib

The door warps enough that two hands are able to reach
through the space and pull the door right off its hinges

Anne uses her mind to fling the molten door at Jane It
crushes and melts onto her skin She screams falls back

And now VULCAN stands in the doorway He is grotesquely
scarred from hundreds of burns

VULCAN
Our Father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name Thy Kingdom
come thy will be done

He throws his arms out and a wave of hot fiery air hits Anne
in the face BURNS her

VULCAN
On earth as it is in Heaven

Anne backs out the door Past the OXYGEN GENERATOR door

VULCAN
Give us this day our daily bread

He seems to grab hold of the air around him and as he
collects it in his hands it begins to heat up and CATCH FIRE

He throws the burning burst of air at Anne Her shirt catches
fire

VULCAN
And forgive us our trespasses

The look in his eyes - he truly is asking for forgiveness
But like an automaton he can’t stop

He goes in for the death blow - but is suddenly yanked back
It’s Jane Wounded and blistered she’s still strong enough
to pick Vulcan up and throw him into the wall He crashes

right through it

Now Jane comes at Anne

JANE
The one who can kill you goes home
And I can’t stay here anymore
Anne I hope you understand

Just as Anne quells the flames on her shirt Jane hits her
The force of the blow throws her back against the wall

Anne dodges another punch which leaves a hole in the wall

ANNE
Think about it Why would he let us
all go like this Pit us against
each other This isn’t real to him
It’s a game

Jane and Anne spar and with Jane wounded the fight is
almost even Anne finally ducks under a punch and kicks Jane
right in the gut

She stumbles a step back falls to one knee

A sense draws Anne’s attention to the place where Vulcan fell
-- a sound or a thought neither of which Jane can hear

ANNE
And I’m sorry Jane But I need to
get Beth out of here I can’t let
you win

Vulcan explodes back into the hallway and throws a blast of
blazing air at Anne

But Anne uses her telekinesis to harness the flame so it
changes direction and hits Jane She’s suddenly burning
alive

Jane doesn’t cry out maybe her body doesn’t even feel pain
anymore She just watches herself as if confused that she’s
dying Then she looks up at Anne and there’s a kind of peace
in her eyes as the flames consume her

Anne looks behind her up at the ceiling - where a CAMERA
WATCHES She knows Marsh is watching somewhere and that
deep threatening stare she gives is for him

VULCAN

-- Steps over Jane already dead and as he does the flames
absorb back into him like he’s just sucking up the heat
wherever he goes

He swipes at Anne She uses his momentum and PUSHES his fist
into the door labeled HYDROGEN-COOLED TUBE GENERATOR

Anne’s palms BURN from touching him but she shoves him
harder The door finally BREAKS OPEN and Vulcan stumbles into
the room

Anne shuts the door fast With her telekinesis she bends the
door hinges so it won’t open

As expected Vulcan tries to melt the door

ANNE
I wouldn’t do that if I were you

As the door glows red Anne runs back to Beth Within the
room Vulcan’s heat EXPLODES the hydrogen and himself with
it

ALARMS BLARE

The pressure blows the door off its hinges The fire escapes
into the hallway now

Anne runs back to the Maintenance Room
INSIDE THE GENERATOR ROOM

The explosion has caused a breach in the retaining wall
WATER sprays through the breach then suddenly the wall just
breaks open letting in the sea

MAINTENANCE ROOM
Anne shoves pills into Beth’s mouth then her own

Atmospheric pressure is changing -- water bursts through
screws in the wall

The pool where the sub sits starts overflowing into the room

ANNE
C’mon Beth C’mon

Anne gets Beth through the sub’s door the water already up
to their knees --

EXT RAVENSBROOK HELIPAD - MOMENTS LATER

All seems quiet up here Too still
The submarine is already docked door open empty
Anne is already helping Beth inside the HELIPLANE

Beth feels safe for the first time But the moment is
fleeting - something over Anne’s shoulder terrifies her

Before Anne can turn her body crumbles to the ground in
perfect pain She is in control of nothing

ANNE’S POV clean white shoes approach
It’s Marsh
He slips the REMOTE back into his pocket And he claps

DR MARSH
That was actually incredible There
were times I wasn’t sure you would
make it

We see live CCTV footage from prison cams on his TABLET
before he tucks it away

Anne groans can’t move through the pain but tries
He’s enjoying how Anne still fights to crawl at him

DR MARSH
Even now you don’t accept it do
you Failure It’s why the Psyche
Serum made your sister go crazy I
think Like most people she
operates in failure You have to if
you love your country You have to
accept a glass ceiling to your
potential But not you right Agent
Reeves Ever the rebel

(thrilled)
(MORE)
He stands

He steps over her

Meanwhile
before

DR MARSH (CONTD)

See I knew all you needed was the
impetus of fear and hope to unlock
the full potential of what your
mind can do And look what it’s
done

(pause)
We are more alike than you wish I
think

over her
DR MARSH
You are my monster
(beat)

Yes we have lots to do don’t we

DR MARSH
I need a team on surface level to
escort Miss Reeves and Miss Olsen
back to Ward 8 please

heads for Beth He speaks into a pager --

we see Anne FOCUS Like she’s never focused

As Marsh makes his way for her sister Anne musters all her
strength and digs through the pain

and stands

His voice
He turns

It hurts

DR MARSH
(to Beth sweetly)
Come down from there my dear --

vanishes

slowly Involuntarily

but Anne walks towards him She points at him and
lowers her finger As she does Marsh lowers to his knees

She reaches into her backpack and sticks the syringe of

SILVER SERUM into Marsh’s neck Like a wash of ice

quickly through his body

it moves

ANNE
(in incredible pain)
Mind Over matter

A flicker of a smile crosses Marsh’s face Pride

Then pride quickly gives way to fear as his heart quickens
His breath lets off puffs of chilled air He tries to walk
away but he stumbles falls to one knee

ANNE
Boreas God of Winter

She kneels down next to him Reaches into his pocket and
slips out his REMOTE

ANNE
You can feel it can’t you

She crushes the remote releasing herself from pain

ANNE
The mild confusion

Regaining her strength she reaches into her backpack Pulls
out the RED SERUM

ANNE
If just one of these kills most
people I imagine all of them at
once is probably a bad idea

He’s about to grab her to stop her but she predicts his
move He’s too weak to fight anyway She holds his hand down
and slowly injects him with the RED SERUM

He WHIMPERS

ANNE
Vulcan God of Fire

The veins in his skin just burst as if burning from the
inside His flesh turns red and bruised He SCREAMS in agony

She pulls out the YELLOW SERUM (Herc) injects him A moment
then we can actually see his muscles breaking down as if the
life is being sucked out of him from the inside

ANNE
Hercules God of Strength

Now the BLUE SERUM Injects him His body arches his mouth
open in a silent scream

ANNE
(emotional)
Psyche The soul

Finally she pulls out the BLACK SERUM
Marsh’s eyes widen in fear

ANNE
Hades God of Death

She injects him The inky poison spider webs through his
veins His breath catches His throat constricts

ANNE
It hurts doesn’t it From the
inside out Inevitable inescapable
pain

He falls to the ground The spider web of black poison moves
up his neck winds through his face

ANNE
You still think you weren’t
creating monsters How could you
create anything else

Marsh is paralyzed now dying on the tarmac

Anne stands over him one last look at this man who in some
ways really has become her creator

She leaves him as the poison makes its way to his heart and
stops it

BETH
(like a child)
Are we going home little monster

ANNE
Yes I’m taking you home

The prison doors open and GUARDS come running

Anne jumps into the plane with Beth

INT HELIPLANE
Beth watches through the window
BETH
You did a bad thing They’1l1 be

mad

watches Marsh’s dead body and the Guards all get smaller
and smaller

BETH
Goodbye monsters Goodbye

Anne looks at Beth wonders how much sanity is left in her

CHARLIE walks with DIRECTOR AMOS

DIRECTOR AMOS
Initial analysis --

CHARLIE
Initial analysis tells us nothing
but that the child is perfectly
healthy I mean perfectly

DIRECTOR AMOS
What did you expect And the

CHARLIE
None yet that we’ve been able to
decipher She’s pretty heavily
sedated though Her mind is doing
just enough to stay alive really
If we had gotten to debrief them a
little more before --

DIRECTOR AMOS
The risk was too high

They finally stop at the window of a room Beth lays within
hooked to an IV A MONITOR shows a live ultrasound of her
baby

DIRECTOR AMOS
And the other

Charlie gets choked up

CHARLIE
The doctor’s in with her --

WAKE
The other is doing just fine

They turn to find WAKE in doctor’s whites Their own version
of Dr Marsh And our DOCTOR from the opening

WAKE
By bringing back themselves they
both brought us more data than
we’ve ever been able to glean
otherwise

Charlie stares at Wake like he’d like to kill the man

DIRECTOR AMOS
What were they told

CHARLIE
Nothing The nurse believed she was
giving her a routine physical So
she didn’t suspect anything when
she was administered the sedative

DIRECTOR AMOS
Because the nurse believed

CHARLIE
Exactly sir

They stand outside Anne’s room now It’s equipped just like
the Ravensbrook rooms but with some Agency touches

Anne lays unconscious with an IV

Charlie can barely look in A man of duty before love And
ashamed of it

he has enough tranquilizers to put
horse down I don’t imagine she
as the wherewithal to hear
nything Let alone what you’re
hinking Still our tests are only
reliminary It’s impossible to
ell how much Marsh succeeded
ootage of her escape perished in
