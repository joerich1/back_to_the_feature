EXT COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN NORTH CAROLINA DAY
ON A BLACK SCREEN Credits

A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMERS) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE
LANGUAGE

A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES shrouded in a blue mist
like a Chinese water color Below them close to a small

town YOUNG MEN armed with vicious sticks and stripped to

the waist come charging in a muscular steaming pack

Their opponents also swinging sticks attach the pack

A ball barely round made of leather emerges smacked
forwards by INMAN who hurtles after it and collides with a
stick swung by SWIMMER a young and lithe American Indian
Inman falls clutching his nose The ball bobbles on the
ground in front of him He grabs it and gets to his feet

the blood pouring from his nose

His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge

A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse comes
down towards the town It has to pass across the temporary
field of play parting the teams Some of the contestants
grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and

its two exotic passengers passes by

The driver is a man in his early fifties dressed in the

severe garb of a minister MONROE And next to him a self-
conscious girl in the spotless elaborate architectural skirts
of the period is his daughter ADA Inman using his shirt

to staunch his battered nose looks at Ada astonished by
her An angel in this wild place

Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins more hesitantly to
translate into English

SWIMMERS VOICE (VO)

You will be lonely You will howl

like a dog as you walk alone You
will carry dog shit cupped in your
hands You will be smeared with dog
shit Your spirit will wane and
dwindle to blue the colour of
despair

As the Cabriolet passes SWIMMER takes the ball an with a
whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal The game
resumes Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other
sticks and fists flailing

EXT COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN NIGHT

A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue The battered teams
eating drinking hard liquor rehearsing victory and defeat
illuminated by a roaring bonfire Swimmer is sewing up a

gash in Inmans cheek as he continues to translate

SWIMMER
This is your path There is no
other Thats a curse you can use on
the Yankee before battle

INMAN
And that works

SWIMMER
You have to say it in Cherokee

INMAN
You said it to me in Cherokee

During this Monroe and Ada have arrived escorted by SALLY
SWANGER a local woman middle-aged kindly and her husband
ESCO a glorious curmudgeon The Monroes are introduced to
various locals Inamn watches them on the other side of the
crowd The Reverend Monroe his daughter Ada Up from
Charleston bringing Gods word to you heathens Is Escos
preferred introduction Building a church Inman watches

Ada moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches
and winces with pain

SWIMMER
So keep your head still

Sally collects plates for the Monroes Hands them to Ada and
her father who wait patiently for silverware Esco takes

a plate picks up a skewer of meat bites on it Monroe
pluckily follows suit

INMAN

(to Swimmer)

Anyway there wont be any war And
if there is they say it wont last

a week

END OF CREDITS AND FADE TO
EXT CONFEDERATE LINES PREDAWN

CAPTION PETERSBURG VIRGINIA JULY 30TH 1864 IN THE FOURTH
YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR

A STAND OF TREES The pastoral lush green Virginia A RABBIT
surfaces from its hole Peace and beauty

A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground darts into

open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE
CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER
ON

THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG Massive wooden barricades in

the shape of crosses rows of Xs define the two lines The

Federals have been laying siege for months So early and

its already hot The trees are an oasis of green in a world

of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches

IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES the men are rousing boiling water
for coffee or to shave smoking stiff from night Theres a

large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the
stub-nosed cannon Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole
Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling

INT TUNNEL PREDAWN

A dark hole Some evil place A scraping sound Shapes
burrowing forwards at a crouch A silent purpose

EXT CONFEDERATE LINES PREDAWN

Young OAKLEY freshly recruited approaches a group of men
like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina
Regiment He doles out breakfast Inman loading his heavy
LeMats pistol its nine rounds is not hungry Oakley serves
another ROURKE last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain
Oakley keeps his head low as he serves
ROURKE

Dont worry son Those Yankee boys
keep store hours They aint open
yet

INT TUNNEL PREDAWN

Shadows and shapes A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel It
reaches a kneeling figure who rolls it forwards A relay

team At the end of the tunnel where it widens a man naked
to the waist crouches stacking the barrels

EXT CONFEDERATE LINES PREDAWN

A RABBIT scared up darts along the trench Rourke sees it
beckons to another Cold Mountain boy Butcher

BUTCHER
Thats fresh breakfast Shoot him

ROURKE

Im not firing start the damn war

off

Butcher chases after the rabbit Rourke in raucous support
INT TUNNEL PREDAWN

The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last
barrel and now retreats paying out the wire as he does so
as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him
EXT CONFEDERATE LINES DAWN

Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements laughing

ROURKE
Thats my rabbit
Great sport Inman fifty yards away looks over amused
goes back to his gun

INT TUNNEL DAWN
The fuze wire is lit It fizzes towards the barrels
EXT CONFEDERATE LINES DAWN

Rourke is running BUT NOW THE GROUND BUCKLES UNDER HIM AND
HES BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR the earth swelling

AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE
GROUND
OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG 90 FEET ACROSS 30 FEET DEEP

HORSES GUNS MEN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES AND THROWN UP INTO
THE
AIR

INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS

Pandemonium The Confederates are in complete disarray The
Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND through the
peaceful oasis of trees roaring the roar of attack They

flood towards the crater hundreds of them charging into a
dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE

THEN THEYRE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CANT GET
OUT AGAIN arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud

The Confederates regroup Orders are yelled Chaos developing
into battle

The Confederates begin firing into the crater Guns and mortar
wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death
trap
Inman gets to his feet Oakley with him and rushes through
the smoke to the pit emptying his LeMats into the crater

LATER A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack Bodies
falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their

comrades even tighter The Confederates make a pincer movement
outside the Crater forcing all the Federals in Its

Medieval

No escape

THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals
Hand to hand fighting Too close for rifles just bayonets

and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that

hell tiring the nine rounds then the shotgun charge which

does a terrible damage Primitive Unutterable carnage Men
killing each other in embraces soldier crushed against

soldier desperate to survive to kill to live An oozing

layer cake of bodies dead and frantically alive drowning

in slick

YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case
clubbing his opponent then slips onto him and is stuck with
a bayonet the pain of which makes him squeal

INMAN GOES AT IT Hes a warrior punching and stabbing and
firing A coldly efficient killer Hes grabbed from behind
and crushed a hand gouging at his face an almighty struggle

He falls and lands on top of Oakley and he and his Federal
opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their
pillow The slaughter continues over and around them the
sound the sound of hell and madness The boy has his arm
around Inman like lovers

LATER The Confederates run after the retreating Union
soldiers firing cavalry riding them down Inman stands
the boys blood all over him exhausted and appalled The
crater behind him an abattoir of men The victors are

yelling pumped mad with adrenaline Butcher comes alongside
Inman

BUTCHER

That was something Thats hell and
weve been there Kicked old Nicks
asshole

A WOUNDED BLACK SOLDIER sits up as Butcher celebrates

Butcher runs over but cant find a charge for his musket
He looks around in the stack of corpses pulling out weapons

tries one not loaded throws it down tries another not
loaded The wounded man cant get up tries to drag himself
like a crab away from Butcher Inman yells at him appalled

BUTCHER
You got a charge

He picks up another musket It fires The wounded Federal
slumps back dead

EXT CONFEDERATE LINES DUSK

THE AFTERMATH The dead being piled up for burial divided
into allegiance Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away

A great deal of casual looting Of boots of equipment of

personal items Inman sees a soldier in the crater lining

up wounded Federals putting their heads in a row THE MAN

EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND SATISFIED HE HAS AN
ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENT PROCEEDS DOWN THE LINE SMASHING
EACH

SKULL
Inman turns away sees another Rebel extravagantly costumed

a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack This is

STOBROD THEWES Hes bent over a dead Federal examining his
mouth He reaches behind his back and roots around in the

knapsack producing A PAIR OF PLIERS WHICH HE INSERTS INTO
THE CORPSES MOUTH Hes yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT
connects with his head and knocks him to the ground

Startled he looks up to see Inman hovering over him

STOBROD

Thats gold in his mouth he got no
need for

(shrugs)

We take his boots

He examines his fiddle for damage Some orderlies pass
lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney

Oakleys pale as a maiden the life leaking from him Inman
walks a way with him Oakley looks up desperate to be brave

OAKLEY
got a few You saw

INMAN
saw

OAKLEY

know you dont recognise me Im
Mo Oakleys boy

(Inman finds this

incredible)

Its okay was thirteen when you
all left Am going to die

Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly whose look confirms
the boys wounds are certainly mortal
INT FIELD HOSPITAL NIGHT

Inman sits on the ground beside Oakleys cot Around them
the wounded are certainly dying makeshift care oil lights
groans

OAKLEY
Id like to hear some music while
go

EXT CONFEDERATE LINES NIGHT

Inman walks around the campfires He hears some fiddle music
Its Stobrod

Stobrod sees Inman Inman stares his expression an
instruction the turns and walks away

INT FIELD HOSPITAL NIGHT

Stobrod stands over Oakley Consults with Inman
STOBROD

What about Bonapartes Retreat Thats
one play

OAKLEY

Play me something sweet Like a girls
waiting for me

Stobrod looks at Inman confused
OAKLEY

Play me something like theres nothing

to fear from a merciful Lord

INMAN
(to Stobrod)
You heard him

STOBROD
(nervous)
only know a couple of tunes

OAKLEY

Like when youre thirsty up at
Bishops Creek and the water is so
cool

Inman glares at Stobrod And Stobrod starts to play

Hesitant then with gathering confidence improvising
increasingly expansive as if hes as surprised as everyone
else Oakleys lips move A whisper Inman leans in

OAKLEY
Im reaching Cold Mountain before
you

Stobrod plays Its wrenching Oakley stills Inman abruptly
puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle stopping Stobrod
The boy is dead Inman gets to his feet and walks away

INT CONFEDERATE TENT NIGHT

A dozen men in the tent Inman has a BOOK its cover gone

rolled up and tied with a leather strap His bookmark is A

FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman He unwraps
the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next

to his bedroll An OFFICER comes into the tent approaches

Inman who makes a stand

OFFICER
Dont get up soldier You are
mentioned tonight in my report You
are a credit to the Highlands to
North Carolina and to the Cause

INMAN

(tight)

Do you have news sir on my
application for transfer

OFFICER

General said Good thing war is so
terrible else a man might end up
liking it too much

INMAN

Sir It was my understanding the
medical corps was desperate for
volunteers

OFFICER

Right now soldier its me who is

in need of volunteers Theres a
dozen Yankees in that stand of trees
between us Stuck there from the
retreat Come daylight they can shoot
us down for sport

EXT CONFEDERATE LINES NIGHT

A beautiful night Lots of stars Inman and three others
including Butcher slide over the top of the trench far to

one side of the stand of trees The plan is to cast a wide

arc that will bring them around back of the trees closer to

the enemy side than their own The four men slither over the
ground They pause Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses

He slithers over them
They work their way towards the trees THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN
FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES They are
dozing

Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate

lines the others have their backs to the enemy sitting

against the trunks grabbing a few minutes sleep

As the four rebels approach still crawling one of the

Federals opens his eyes sees the attack shifts for his

rifle INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP FIRING INSTANTLY killing
him and two others while Butcher throws himself at another

The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inmans party
and all of the Federals lay dead Then the rebels break from
the trees

A FLARE goes up then another both from the Confederate
trenches INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A
BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT Shots follow from both sides aimed

at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own

lines As they get close voices cry out rippling down the

trench joining their own admonitions Dont shoot Hold

your fire theyre our boys Hold your fire Theyre almost

home Butcher is laughing whooping Then just as suddenly

he falls wounded Inman stops turns back runs to him

Inman collects Butcher drags him carries him Theyre fifty
yards from their lines A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK

He goes down like a tree blood pouring from his neck Lying
on the ground he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly
fade to black all sound fading with them

EXT CHAPEL COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN 3 YEARS EARLIER DAY
A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge Men

are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL below

workers armed with nails and hammer knees clutching a
rafter is Inman fresh and a whole lifetime younger Rourke
and Butcher are also there hammering building kidding around
and Oakley barely a teenager

Below them women are setting up a lunch for the workers

At the piano she unwraps the leather lace from the package

of music Inside the first book of music theres a

DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats a typical Confederate

continues to say something to Rourke who says something to
Butcher the news spreading like wildfire Rourke gets up

sweethearts embracing

ADA

the boxcar flashing on Inmans face as he drifts in and out

STOBRODS FIDDLE Stobrod is serenading him accompanied by
an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man PANGLE whose
grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic

Whatd he say
PANGLE
Says he aint about to die

STOBROD

(to Inman)

rhythm the two musicians grinning at each other Inman lapses
back into unconsciousness The rhythm becomes a hammering
sound

stuffs it into his mouth cutting this diatribe short And

then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree cursing
through the handkerchief

EXT SUNKEN FOREST DAY

Inman finds himself in ASUNKEN FOREST OF PINE He moves
warily his beard longer his figure gaunt his clothes
weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal

He hears DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE FAINT SHOUTS He picks
up his pace skirts round the swampy lake

EXT CAPE FEAR RIVER DUSK

Inman comes to the bank of a HUGE RIVER The water as the
light begins to go is the color of mud with bubbles

belching to the surface full of ugly prominent Inman is

almost jogging now an ear tracking his still distant

pursuers The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and
now it begins to curve left forcing him -- against his

judgment to circle back He approaches A SMALL JETTY

A sign Ferry 5 Yell Loud
On the far bank theres A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater
mark Inman calls out reluctantly his voice still a kind
of growl Then again

A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping
into a small canoe The canoe heads against the current the
rowers back bent with the effort As the canoe approaches
Inman sees that the ferryman is in fact A YOUNG GIRL not
eighteen She doesnt look at him He produces five dollars

She eyes the bill with contempt

FERRYGIRL

For five dollars wouldnt give a
parched man a dipper of this
riverwater

INMAN
Sign says ferry five dollars

FERRYGIRL

This look like a ferry My Daddys
dead or gone off to the Federals
dont matter which Im the way across
now

INMAN
Whats the name of this thing

FERRYGIRL
Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear
River is all

A dog barks in the distance Getting closer Inman turns to
the sound The Ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage

FERRYGIRL
Nobody crosses this water unless
theyre running from someplace Some
cross one way some the other makes
no difference theyre all running

You want to wait for your friends

INMAN
can give you thirty dollars script

FERRYGIRL
Lets go

VOICE (0OS)
Hey Hey Wait

Inman is astonished to see VEASEY stumble out of the trees
His head is shaved his face bruised and swollen his clothes
castoffs and ill-fitting cinched at the waist with rope He
stumbles towards Inman urging him to get on with the journey

VEASEY
Keep going Were both in trouble

He gets straight into the canoe

INMAN
No Get out

VEASEY
Its Homeguard Made me tell them
all about you

INMAN
should have shot you when had
the chance

Shouts more barking Inman jumps in the canoe and theyre
off The Ferrygirl turns the boat around rows them away
from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for
the thousandth time

VEASEY

Im not looking for revenge by the
way For what you did to me No Im
a Pilgrim now like you traveling

the road paying our dues relying
on the kindness of strangers

INMAN

Youre nothing like me and the last
thing want right now is a
conversation

VEASEY

(to Ferrygirl)

You recall Job in the scriptures

will give free utterance to my
complaint will speak in the
bitterness of my soul Thats our
friend here

(to Inman)

They cut off my hair Which was hard
was vain about my hair

(to Ferrygirl)

had good curls But deserved it

Im the Reverend Veasey Have seen
you in church

Inman sits scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers The
sun is sinking fast

FERRYGIRL

Im saving for a cowhide and when
get it aim to get a saddle made
and when get me a saddle Ill save
for a horse and when got a horse
Ill throw on the saddle and then
you wont see my sorry ass round
this swamp again

She has no love for the river Another gurgle of viscous
bubbles around the canoe

VEASEY
Whats that

FERRYGIRL

Catfish gator Keep your hand in
the boat Already looks like some
critter chewed his neck

(she looks at Inman)

Thirty more dollars we can go to
the cabin Ill pull this dress over
my head

VEASEY
(excited)
Have we got thirty dollars

A sharp sound a tiny thwack of ball on meat The Ferrygirl
SUDDENLY SLUMPS BACK and falls into the water

Veasey grabs out at the oar but it goes too The girl sinks
quickly A BLOODY GAP to the side of her head Inman on his
knees and stretching cant help her Then a second noise as
A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST appears in the canoe just at
waterlevel Water pours into the canoe Dogs bark and now
FIGURES are visible at the jetty HOME GUARD One of them
has a snipers rifle and is loading for a third shot Inman

can see him sighting the rifle They lie flat in the canoe

ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out Now the boat is
almost full of water Veasey spits out a foul mouthful INMAN

ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM Veasey
surfaces from under it clutching the wood as a raft but
the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks
Veasey hauls him to the surface and surprisingly strong

holds him with one fist the boat with the other lets the

current take them pulling them under then up under then

up but clinging on as the rifle continues to deliver its

assault another shot into the boat another into the water

near to Veaseys arm

THE GIRLS BODY comes by them carried by the river the
dress billowing out almost covering her head The sun has
gone the light fading the canoe sliding downriver away
from their aggressors

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPE FEAR NIGHT

In the moonlight the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and
Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land both of them
retching with the vile river water AN ALLIGATOR eases into
the river not ten feet from where they lie lungs heaving
They get up Veasey to his feet Inman to his knees

VEASEY
You okay

Inman nods coughs And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inmans head
knocking him back into the mud

INMAN
Jesus god

VEASEY

history Otherwise Id bear a grudge
on our journey

INMAN
Theres nowhere Im going with you
except to Hellfire

Inman carefully scouts the track then with great caution
edges towards the river bank
A HEAVY SET MAN labours in the water Hes contemplating THE

The Home Guard ride bent under their oilskins as the rain

tips down Between the horses unprotected and drenched
their prisoners trudge along the muddy path Inman and Veasey
among them Veasey has grown some beard
AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES lies where he falls not moving

Theres a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him He
picks himself up then tries to pull up the older man He

INMAN
This mans dead

Nobody pays any attention He has to drag the body
EXT VEASEY TOWN DAY

THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEYS OLD
CHURCH

More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners
Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced The
Home Guards stop for food a wash a break chain the
prisoners to a horse rail

Citizens go by Veasey knows them all Some of them spit
contemptuously at the Deserters None of them recognise
Veasey

VEASEY
Am so altered that they dont see
me

Somebody walks by with a young child
Veasey looks at Inman

VEASEY

The child stops looks without recognizing is tugged away
from the chain gang by his mother One of the other prisoners
SHEFFIELD leans in to Inman his voice low

woman recognizes her

VEASEY

In daylight its apparent that Rebecca is a real beauty She
turns at the sound of her name stops is confused She sees
Veasey and approaches appalled at his condition

cares about him And seeing her has somehow broken his heart

He turns away from Inman towards Sheffield

VEASEY

EXT RAILROAD TRACK DAY
THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK horses on either side
of them steep banks forming a V for the railroad A TRAIN

IS COMING Brown rides up to the prisoners herds them off

the track The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars

full of wounded soldiers Some of the Home Guard dismount

take out pipes The prisoners wait one of them sits down

Sheffield says something to Veasey who casually yanks up
the sitting prisoner Inman suddenly understands whats going
to happen The train is almost on them

INMAN
No

But its too late SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE
TRAIN PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM their reluctance
tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming

train

SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK stumbling
and

chaotic the chains yanking tight then loose the tight

causing a collapse the loose a recovery

They run alongside the train blocking themselves from the
fire of the Guard Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then
as the train starts to pull past them they run up the bank
now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE
REMOUNTED

THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT Then they
have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top

of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along

the ridge Sheffields yelling with adrenaline Veasey joins

in elated One of the guards raises a rifle steadies himself

on his horse FIRES He catches Veasey who crumples spinning
round and falling down the bank until Inman uses all his
strength and practically lifts him in the air The chain
recovers and works back up the bank

But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this

time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS

OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK The Home Guard approach
firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch

by the side of the track Until all movement ceases Inman

has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely almost

completely covering his face Brown arrives considers the

carnage

BROWN
Get these sacks of shit under the
ground

INT BARN BLACK COVE FARM DAWN

EXT RAILROAD TRACK MORNING

THE SOUND OF TINY BELLS A misty drizzle A GOAT snuffles
around in the freshly turned dirt A hand pale and wet

protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies

of the murdered Chain Gang

SOMETHING SHIFTS UNDER THE DIRT breaking the surface Inman
wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains

wrapped around him has regained consciousness He coughs

cant breathe properly tries to work himself some air

spitting out dirt He makes a noise to distract the goat

rattling the chains Inman rears up the bodies slithering

off him but even then the animal only retreats a yard or

two VEASEY SLIDES FACE UP A BULLET IN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A
MYSTICAL THIRD EYE Inman feels a surprising loss and
tenderness He heaves again groaning with the pain of new
and old wounds

and nuzzles into her hand She strokes it and scratches under
the chin The creature gets increasingly tranquil

INMAN

INMAN
Twenty six years

MADDY

Charleston Youre going somewhere

difference

Shes still stroking the goat It looks as if its asleep

MADDY

Ive learned a person can survive

off pretty much of a goat cant

abide a chicken but a goat gives

you company and milk and cheese and
then when you need it good meat

In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT

THE THROAT OF THE GOAT putting the bowl underneath its neck
to catch the blood still stroking the goat which blinks as

if it were only surprised and not dying

MADDY
So youve been fighting

INMAN

(as if he might break)

could be at killing for days
sometimes in the hand to hand my
feet against the feet of my enemy
and always killed him and he never
killed me

MADDY
He gave it a try to look at you
INMAN
I guess he did

MADDY

See think theres a plan Theres

a design For each and every one of
us

During this shes shucked the skin off the goat with the
authority of someone whos done this a thousand times

MADDY

You look at nature a bird flies
somewhere picks up a seed shits
the seed out a plant grows Birds
got a job seeds got a job

And the goat is now thin and pink eyes bulging a piece of
meat

INT MADDYS CARAVAN EVENING

A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which
pieces of the goat meat sprinkled with herbs are sizzling
in a pan

INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED WRAPPING THE MEAT IN
CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH Maddy
watches

him adds another mound of meat to his plate Inman nods in

thanks but -- doesnt look up

She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads
puts them near the stove then dips into another jar and
pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs

MADDY
Take one of these now with your food
Inman is circumspect views the stub lozenge with suspicion

MADDY
Swallow it If you die Ill give you
your money back

Inman puts it in his mouth gags at the taste of it She
hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down

MADDY

Our minds arent made to hold on to
the particulars of pain the way we
do bliss

She starts steaming the poppies

Maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium then
hands Inman the liquid

MADDY
Now drink this It visits the pain
And youll sleep

He drinks the laudanum shes made

INMAN
Ive had to put myself in the way of
peoples kindness

MADDY

She dips a cloth in the steaming water unbuttons his shirt
She has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline She
smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp
Inman surrenders to the drug

INMAN

The passenger pigeons fly south the
berries ripen Whether see them or
not whether a man dies or a war is
won

MADDY
Thats the laudanum getting to you

(she kneels to his

leg)
Raise that up for me

He obliges She grimaces at the state of it where the chain
has chewed into the flesh Gets to work

INMAN

She gave me a book Ada Monroe Man
by the name of Bartram Wrote about
his travels carried that book

through every battle left it
someplace got to get it back
Sometimes just reading the name of a
place near home -- Sorell Cove Fire

me to tears Thing is Ive been
thinking -- those places belonged to
people before us to the Indian --

and he had a different name What
did he call Sorell Cove How cana
name not even the real name break
your heart Its her shes the place

So how can a person whos maybe not

over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes
over him

the same business of walking him singing the while an odd
lament Inman eats looks at her at the child and the fire

exchange seems to contain a promise a sexual charge

SARA

things out into the freezing morning He has his pants on

but is otherwise naked He swings over the window and down
onto the frosty ground

EXT SARAS CABIN EARLY
Inman picks up his stuff and at a crouch runs for cover to

the wood which borders the property He can hear horses and
a commotion at the front of Saras cabin but doesnt look
round until hes sheltered by the trees

FEDERAL SOLDIERS a raiding party have dismounted and are
already wrangling with Sara Inman watches pulling on his
shirt shivering then his boots

Sara is standing in front of the hogpen as if to protect

the animal but one of the soldiers PISTOL barges her to
one side toppling her and opens the gate starts herding
the hog out into the yard A second soldier NYM emerges
from the cabin carrying Ethan Sara starts up struggles
with him is again knocked down

INMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST
AND

ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT
ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD

Then Sara starts to scream

Inman is dressed Boots on He looks back at the yard The
men sitting smoking prepared to wait their breath coming
out in gusts in the freezing air Flakes of snow fall

PISTOL

SARA

Behind Inman Sara stands with a rifle
EXT SARAS CABIN LATE DAY

THERES A HUGE FIRE GOING WITH A CAULDRON HUNG OVER IT
THE

HOG HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM A TREE BLOOD DRIPPING INTO A
BOWL

Theres a sense of ritual and order the chapters of
transforming the hog into food

Sara is inside the cabin the door open onto the yard She
holds the baby by the fireplace swaddled up tight

She tries to put him to her breast but he wont feed She
puts Ethan back in his crib comes outside

Now Inman is butchering the hog chopping down either side
of the spine to make two sides of meat Now Sara is holding
up a sheet of hog fat as if it were a lace shawl Now shes
rendering the fat into lard Now Inmans salting the two
hams Now Saras washing the intestine She sings all the
while -- dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and
my bride bed full of blood -- they dont really converse
Inman continues to work

Sara goes back inside to Ethans crib Inman glances back
but can hardly bear to her anxiety so palpable THE BABY IS
DEAD She looks at it She takes it up in her arms Kisses

its forehead

Makes a strange stifling noise Inman doesnt look at her
She comes out again shovels some of the food into a plate
serves it up to Inman gently touching him as she does so
Then serves out food for herself Inman starts to eat

SARA
Good

Inman nods She collects up the knapsacks including Inmans
and goes back inside the house with them Inman squats
eating glancing back towards the cabin Theres the sudden
shocking report of a revolver

Inman knowing what it is goes slowly towards the house and
its two dead bodies His own face is a rictus the eyes thin
slits If he gave into his grief it would never cease

boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse He puts his
hand into the ashes of Rubys fire cant feel any warmth

Its getting dark He takes a drink from the stream shudders
at the cold

snow falls

He starts to move more quickly racing the snow as it seeks
to erase the tracks The snow thickens

around him He cant quite identify its source but he runs
again heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him

EXT TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE MORNING

Ada collects the two turkeys the first creatures shes ever

shot Doesnt quite know how to hold them She straightens

up and sees at the other end of the tree tunnel backlit by

the morning sun THE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN She drops the
turkeys tires to reload the shotgun

Inman comes down the tunnel approaching the hunter he sees
through the snow at the other end of it

ADA
Turn round and go back where you
came from

Inman is bewildered by this womans voice in a mans outfit
keeps walking peering through the snow Ada fires a warning
shot Inman still some distance suddenly understands

of trees

INMAN

ANGRY CROWS FLYING TOWARDS HER AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IS A
SMALL HIEROGLYPH OF A MAN

FINALLY THE IMAGE FROM THE SWANGER WELL EXACTLY AS SHE
FIRST
SAW IT

THE FIGURE RAISES A HAND BRIEFLY THEN PITCHES FORWARD
INTO
THE SNOW
She runs her heart broken towards the body of Inman Hes
dead the red flag of his life ebbed away in the snow Ada
falls to her knees and pulls him over the snow crusted on
his face which she wipes away with great tenderness then
sits his head in her lap as Ruby slowly comes up the hill
towards them

A VIOLIN PLAYS quite raucous
INT KITCHEN BLACK COVE FARM EASTER DAY

A GIRL about five or six with Adas curls sits at the

table cradling a tiny lamb which wont feed from the nippled
bottle she offers it She tries again Ada comes in suddenly
takes a knife from the kitchen and hurries out

The girl gets up carries the lamb out into the field

cat on the ground She approaches Grace takes the live lamb
from her arms the girl resistant frightened
