An intricate piano piece - GEORGE FREDERICK HANDEL

INTERCUT WHITE ON BLACK CREDITS WITH BELOW

INT RUSTIC STUDIO OF AN ARTISAN DAY 1
A series of shots
Blue sky through shabby windows

Run down walls A paint splashed pine floor Tens of paint
brushes soaking in stained jars

An artisan’s hands - weather-worn swirling a paint brush
in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars

A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde blue eyed
as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster
girl for 18th century portraiture (We will later
recognise her as ELIZABETH MURRAY)

CAPTION ENGLAND 1766

EXTINT DOCKSSLUM ROOM ENGLAND - DAY 2

A swallow cuts across a red tinged sky SOUND of footsteps
trudging through mud

EXTREME CLOSE UP a small figure being dressed by someone —
a shoulder an arm little hands We do not see a face

CLOSE heavy naval boots move at sombre pace through slums
Against a stone floor a child’s feet are laced into boots
A starving dog barks darts between tradesmen sailors

Hold this image as Handel comes to an END

INT SLUM ROOM - DAY 2

A CHILDS POV as the door opens We see a gentleman in
ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
aristocratic handsomealarmed at the sight before him

His eyes close with some sad internal pain and as they re-
openWe see what he sees

A fragile girlaround six years old stands in shabby
surroundings Her terrified eyes stare back leaving
LINDSAY at a loss He takes in her features - delicate
with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity

She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLEpart black part white
He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
Hello little girlLittle Dido
(pause)
I am your father

Silence Then a tear rises to the surface and as her
confused tears spill so too do LINDSAYS

His POV a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar

CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT’D)

(xe Dido)
How lovely she is So much of her
mother

(his eyes sting)
I triedbut howhow could I
separate a mother from her child
(he restrains tears)
And now nature has deprived me of
such a dilemma

He composes himself - feeling futile

CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT’D)
Thank youfor taking her

He reaches into his pocket holds out money to the woman

CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT’D)
You may leave us

The WOMAN hesitates scurries to DIDO placing her lips to
the child’s head in a prolonged kiss Then she is gone
DIDO is left frightened and stunned

CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT’D)
Do not be afraid sweet thing I
am to take you to a good life
The life you were born to

He takes out a cube of chocolate shows it to her She is
reluctant He takes a bite - delicious DIDO moves
forward He puts the chocolate in her hand She tastes
it Sweet cocoa and sugarand now her tiny mouth is
filled It makes LINDSAY laugh out loud

EXT DOCKS - DAY 2
A driver HARRY - seated at a fine carriage

As HARRY becomes alarmed - from his POV LINDSAY moves
towards us - the mulatto child in arms
EXT KENWOOD HOUSE LAWNS DAY 2

Silence except bird song - the splendor of the English
countryside - A neoclassical estate stretches before us

The figure of a LITTLE GIRL running across the lawns - her
giggle fills the air her outline faded by the sun

At French doors to the nursery a furious greying woman -
LADY MARY MURRAY (40s) waves a wooden spoon and yells

LADY MARY
Elizabeth Murray bring yourself
back here this very moment
The child crashes to the grass in fits of laughter She is
no more than 6 years old — Hair the colour of bleached hay
and delicate pale skin

She rolls on to her back squinting at the sunlight as
The SOUND of horse and carriage at the front of the house

ELIZABETH bolts upright Her POV As CAPTAIN SIR JOHN
LINDSAY guides DIDO from the carriage

WIMBRIDGE the butler steps out to receive them

A tear spills and DIDO’s little fingers come up to wipe it
from his cheek He presses his lips to her hand sobbing a

moment and then he is gone - to stay any longer would be
too much to bare

gently takes DIDO’S hand in hers leads her off to run
between the trees As their delighted screams filter

LADY MANSFIELD enters - observes LORD Mansfield a moment

LADY MANSFIELD
Born on English soil
LORD MANSFIELD
Indeed He discovered her mother
aboard a captured Spanish slave
ship He was charged with
conveying it back to these
shores he tells me

LADY MANSFIELD
Evidently he had somefeeling’
for the woman

LORD MANSFIELD
(ary)
And there I was believing it was
sheer lack of ‘self control’
(scathing)
He has been at sea six years
All of this child’s life

LADY MANSFIELD
Well he clearly saw to their
wellbeing The child is not
altogether uncivilized
(she breathes deeply)
Sonow we have two nieces in
our guardianship

LORD MANSFIELD
(xeticent)
Elizabeth was much in need of a
companion

LADY MANSFIELD
And that is what we shall say
when questions are asked of us

LORD MANSFIELD
We shall say that in accordance
with her birthright she is
entitled to live beneath this roof
(with irony)
Suchis the nature of ‘order’

LADY MANSFIELD
And where in this ‘order’ should
her colour be placed Below or
above her Murray bloodline
(off his silence)
May she dine with us

LORD MANSFIELD
She may(pause)NOTin
company We cannot escape
society’s confines on etiquette

LADY MANSFIELD
Marriage

He shakes his head at the complexity of it all

LORD MANSFIELD

Impossible Any match her’other

origins’ may attract would surely

disgrace her and the family rank
LADY MANSFIELD

And when we are no longer here No

husband - who will take care of her

Darkness DIDO and ELIZABETH lie in separate beds Only a
shaft of moonlight illuminates their faces

ELIZABETH
He must have loved you Dido

DIDO
He did not know me

ELIZABETH
My father’s new wife wishes him
to leave me not a thing and he
obliges her

DIDO
Then it is her cruelty you should
lament Bette not his stupidity

ELIZABETH
I think he might have loved me
more if Mamaa had not died

DIDO

complicated thing

EXT KENWOOD HOUSE LAKE - DAY4 20

A blaze of rhododendron azaleas DIDO strolls with LORD
MANSFIELD along Kenwood’s lake orange sunlight glistens

DIDO
She is a most disagreeable
hideous old maid - I hate her

LORD MANSFIELD
You do not She is only managing
the dictates of the household

DIDO
Papaahowhow may I be too high
in rank to dine with the servants
and too low to dine with my family

LORD MANSFIELD
Dinner with guests is a formal
proceeding Dido - we simply
cannot impose the disregard of
those formalities upon visitors

DIDO
ButPapaa am I not’wealthy’
nowan heiress Surely that
changes matters

LORD MANSFIELD
(softly)
My dearI wish it were so
simple Finances may go some way -
but Society has a habit of
disregarding even one of their
own when opportunity provides

DIDO
(stung)
Of course(trailing off)

LORD MANSFIELD
BUT after dinnerwhen formality
is of less consequencewell
your presence can raise no
defendable objections

ELIZABETH emerges from the house breathless

ELIZABETH
There you are I have been
searching for you

LADY MANSFIELD
(to Dido)
What a wretched countenance
LADY MARY
She deplores my authority What
am I in this household if not
the ‘observer of rules’

ELIZABETH
I would rather dine with Dido

She links arms with DIDO in solidarity

LADY MANSFIELD
What a great pity

LADY MANSFIELD and LADY MARY feign nonchalance

LADY MARY
Indeed

LADY MANSFIELD
Our young gentlemen guests shall
miss you Elizabeth

Both girls’ eyes widen - DIDO’s with disappointment

ELIZABETHDIDO
Young gentlemen

LADY MARY
Very good connections

LADY MANSFIELD
And most agreeable by all accounts

both have inherited her striking looks

ELIZABETH whispers in JAMES’ ear LADY MARY glares

JAMES ASHFORD
What excellent French Though I
have not an idea of what you said

ELIZABETH
I said ‘Your hands have the
suggestion of a sensitive man’

She wrinkles her nose minxish Across the table

LADY ASHFORD
I must say the entire country
barely breathes awaiting your
judgement on this appeal
Terrified you shall destroy
England no doubt I know Lord A
is He does wonder though what
can be taking youso long

LORD MANSFIELD
(mild condescension)
The law Lady Ashford It is to be
interpreted — not merely administered

LORD MANSFIELD (CONT’D)
Your husband of all people knows this

LADY MARY
My brother is not a man of rash instinct

LADY MANSFIELD
For that we are all grateful

LADY ASHFORD
What a lot of fuss over dead cargo

LORD MANSFIELD
It is a fuss over the bread and
butter of a great many in these
isles A great many Lady Ashford

OFF LORD MANSFIELDS distaste

EXT KENWOOD HOUSE LAWNS - NIGHT 4 23

The windows glint with candlelight DIDO sits at a bench
alone Laughter from the house carries in the breeze

A rustle in the branches behind her She stands startled
A beat then she turns on her heels and sprints - fast

INT KENWOOD HOUSE ENTRANCE HALL NIGHT 4 24
Breathless DIDO races inside as WIMBRIDGE appears

DIDO
Wimbridge

WIMBRIDGE
Miss Lindsay

DIDO
There are poachers wandering

The sound of the echoing doorbell jolting DIDO Her eyes
dart to the door WIMBRIDGE hesitates then answers

A YOUNG MAN stands damp brow and as breathless as DIDO
We recognise him as the YOUNG MAN seen earlier in the
church He is JOHN DAVINIER son of REVEREND DAVINIER

JOHN
Good evening to you I am John

Davinier II believe I may have
disturbed a lady of this house

He sets eyes on DIDO peering from the great staircase

JOHN (CONTD)
she is there

(calling out to her)
Please forgive methough you
barely gave me a chance

Ah

DIDO turns her back horrified How dare he address her
without formal introduction

DIDO
Sir I do not believe we have
been introduced

JOHN takes hold of himself half mortified half irritated

JOHN

Indeed II

(to Wimbridge feeling

foolish)
Please inform the lady of my
apologies for startling her I
took advantage of the back
fields by way of a short-cut to
deliver this to Lord Mansfield
from my father

WIMBRIDGE
Sir

He hands WIMBRIDGE an envelope

JOHN
Reverend Davinier

WIMBRIDGE
Of course sir I will see that
he gets it immediately

DIDO can’t help but interfere She calls over her shoulder
DIDO
You shall not interrupt him at
dinner Wimbridge

WIMBRIDGE
Immediately - after dinner sir

JOHN resists rolling his eyes - ghastly female

JOHN
Yes of coursethank you

He backs away DIDO still shows him nothing but her back
JOHN (CONTD)
(to Wimbridge awkward)
Good night

WIMBRIDGE
Good night sir

He moves off and is gone as DIDO finally turns stares at
the closed door flushed

INT KENWOOD HOUSE DRAWING ROOM CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 4 25

A single figure - at the farthest end of the crimson
drawing roomDIDO’S heart skips a beat at the SOUND of
the approaching dinner partySuddenly the doors open
DIDO stands quickly — nervous

LORD MANSFIELD
Didomy dear

LADY ASHFORD
(whispers to her sons)
Good Lord - the negro She really is

JAMES ASHFORD
(quietly disturbed)
vsea lady

OLIVER
Capital

LADY ASHFORD
I hadn’t expected her to look
so black

OLIVER
Mamaa did you not listen to the
rumours when you were spreading
them

DIDO curtseys respectfully to LORD MANSFIELD

LORD MANSFIELD
May I present to you the second
of my nieces - Miss Dido Lindsay

DIDO curtseys LADY ASHFORD nods graciously OLIVER bows -
has to nudge his troubled brother do the same

OLIVER
A pleasure Miss Lindsay

She curtseys once again then moves to sit with ELIZABETH

ELIZABETH

(sotto - re James)
He is the eldest - to inherit the
entire Ashford fortune He is
also to inherit from his uncle -
a healthy man who shows little
sign of departure

DIDO
How do you know

ELIZABETH
Lady Ashford herself She seems
rather despondent at her
brothers robust constitution

JAMES catches DIDO’S soft brown eyes resting on him

DIDO
He has much to recommend him And
a second fortune in life should
please any wife

ELIZABETH clocks the gaze between DIDO and JAMES

ELIZABETH
Dido You are not to be a
coquette with him You already
have your fortune

DIDO
Are you suggesting I now
condescend to a gentleman without
means Bette What should good
society think of us

OLIVER moves to his brother follows his gaze to DIDO

OLIVER
She is intriguing is she not

JAMES
I find her repulsive

OLIVER
I suppose she isif you find a
most rare and exotic flower so
She is quite something to behold

ON DIDO as she falters under the brothers’ stares

ELIZABETH
(flustered to DIDO)
Good Lord They are appraising me

ELIZABETH composes herself JAMES’ eyes remain on DIDO
swallowing hard at her undeniable beauty

JAMES
One does not make a wife of the
rare and exotic Oliver One
samples it on the cotton fields
of the Indies

OLIVER
So far when it is right at my door

JAMES
-Then finds a pure ENGLISH rose
to decorate one’s home

OLIVER smiles OFF both men - trained on DIDO

INT KENWOOD HOUSE DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT 4 26

ELIZABETH is at the pianoforte She sings plays hard for
JAMES’ attention gazing up at him as he stands beside her

LADY ASHFORD
Is she ‘OUT’

LADY MANSFIELD
(embarrassed)
Not quite

LADY MARY
(awkward)
Any day now

LADY ASHFORD raises an amused eyebrow - precocious creature

OLIVER offers DIDO a discreet smile as she sits beside
LORD MANSFIELD His mother quietly moves across to him

LADY ASHFORD

You will refrain from any
intercourse with the negress

(beat)
Lord and Lady Mansfield may find
it fascinating to have a Lady
Mulatto running around their
household but I will not have
one running around mine

OLIVER
She is an heiress

A seamless change of heart for LADY ASHFORD

LADY ASHFORD
Although exceptions can be made

OLIVER
It is said that her father left
her a rather vast fortune

LADY ASHFORD
I mean to say if that is your
inclination

OLIVER
She is rather soft on the eye - I
have thought no further Mamaa
LADY ASHFORD stares across at DIDO

LADY ASHFORD
From where did you receive your
information

OLIVER
Her sister-cousin has a rather
fast tongue

ON LADY ASHFORD as she studies DIDO ELIZABETH finishes
amid a smattering of polite applause led by JAMES

OLIVER (CONTD)
And what of you Miss Lindsay
Are we to hear you play tonight
DIDO looks up to find OLIVER smiling across at her
DIDO
Well
(deferring to her father)
Papaa
LORD MANSFIELD hesitates DIDO is embarrassed
OLIVER
Oh do not be selfish with your
good fortune m’lord

A beatthen put on the spot LORD MANSFIELD caves
throwing up his hands helplessly

DIDO is tentative ELIZABETH less pleased

LADY ASHFORD
This will be most interesting

DIDO moves to the pianoforte settles her fingers on the
keys A beat then Handel’s Suite No9 fills the room

LORD MANSFIELD closes his eyes irritated with himself
LADY MARY whispers to LADY MANSFIELD

LADY MARY
She has never played in company

LADY MANSFIELD is silent - stiff with anxiety

DIDO is raising a beautiful and fluent sound - as skillful
as the most gifted of Georgian young ladies

LORD MANSFIELD’S eyes spring open - sees all held hostage
OLIVER moves forward utterly fascinated

Relief floods LADY MANSFIELD - she sighs with pride as LADY

MARY lends LADY ASHFORD a smug look

LADY ASHFORD
(conceding)
She ismost accomplished

LADY MANSFIELD
(with deep satisfaction)
Hers was a most diligent governess

INT KENWOOD HOUSE UPSTAIRS CORRIDORS - NIGHT 4 27

Echoing footsteps LORD and LADY MANSFIELD move toward

better intentions towards her

She stops in her tracks briefly suddenly unsure

LADY MANSFIELD (CONT’D)
Can he

They round a corner

LADY MANSFIELD (CONTD)
-His family name will no doubt
entice her to take him seriously

LORD MANSFIELD
She must not delude herself Such
decisions are not hers to make

LADY MANSFIELD
Then spell it out to her Before
she renders herselfsport to
some ‘gent’ of cruel promises

LORD MANSFIELD
She has no reason Hers is an
inheritance that renders her free
of the usual inducements to marry

LADY MANSFIELD
Well that at least is true
(burdened grave)
Indeed it is Elizabeth who needs
to secure her bread and butter

INT KENWOOD HOUSE GROUND FLOOR CORRIDORSSTUDIO DAY 5 28

Feminine feet move along the corridor REVEAL DIDO making

to SEE me before deciding

She throws her hands up woefully and finds another face
staring back at her - It is JOHN DAVINIER He regards her
from a huge law book She stands mortified

DIDO (CONTD)
(to Lord M)
I am sorryI did not know you

LORD MANSFIELD
(ary)
Mr Davinier I believe you have
already had the pleasure

JOHN
(ironic)

Insome way - yes

Miss Lindsay

She curtseys brief and stiff - a smile to match
LORD MANSFIELD
Decide what

She is hesitant now awkward in JOHN’S presence

DIDO
If he shouldshould WANT to
paint me

LORD MANSFIELD
The man is to be paid a fortune
What is there to decide

DIDO
But

LORD MANSFIELD
Dido you are to simply sit
still Not a challenging task

DIDO
(anxious)
Nextnext to Elizabeth

LORD MANSFIELD
As you always are - right beside
one another

DIDO’s chest heaves with distress

JOHN
Shouldshould not any lady be
flattered to be such a subject

His tone is impatient irritating her

DIDO
How should any male know the ways
of a lady when he has not even
mastered the ways of a gentleman

JOHN
Quite Though one should be
forgiven for thinking he was in
the presence of a lady - when she
is in fact still a juvenile

DIDO
Papaa may we do this in private

LORD MANSFIELD
Not now no You may return the
books to the library

DIDO
Papaa
LORD MANSFIELD casts her a stare and she is silenced
DIDO begins collecting giant hardbacks exasperated

LORD MANSFIELD
Upon her husbands death a widow
may receive

JOHN
-her marriage portion and
inheritance at once She has forty
days to leave her husbands home

LORD MANSFIELD
Hummm
(contemplation)
Yours are grand ambitions

JOHN says nothing - swallows hard DIDO steals a glance

LORD MANSFIELD (CONT‘D)
What is the purpose of the law in
your eyes Mr Davinier

JOHN
To to provide certainty where
there might otherwise be none

LORD MANSFIELD
Example

JOHN
The Zong ship and those drowned

LORD MANSFIELD stiffens He looks uncomfortably at DIDO
piling books JOHN’S eyes follow

LORD MANSFIELD
It is one of the few trades
acceptable to a gentleman

JOHN
I am no member of the nobility -
I have little butwhere my
father relies on the bible II
wish to rely on the law courts

LORD MANSFIELD
You aspire to the judiciary

LORD MANSFIELD laughs at him DIDO stares at the ground -
cringing on JOHNS behalf John asserts himself

JOHN
One dayyesmlord I wish to
make the laws not only administer
them - for thatthat is how I may
truly change this world I mean to
say make it a better place

A beat His words force DIDO to look up affected

LORD MANSFIELD
Noble if not pompous A country
lawyer you may make - perhaps If
you pay every regard to what you
are taught - but you have neither
the rank nor finances for any more

JOHN
(tentative)
If I may m’lord - neither did you

LORD MANSFIELD
I beg your pardon

JOHN
Wellas a fourth son you had
rank but not the income to pay for
your qualification to the Inns

DIDO’s wide eyes take in JOHN astonished by his chuzpah

JOHN (CONTD)
Without the sponsorship of Lord
Foley and William Hamiltonthe
English courts may not have
benefited from your brilliance -
and the title Lord Chief Justice
could not be yours todayM’lord

LORD MANSFIELD
You believe you are worthy of
such considerations Such are
your capabilities

JOHN
That I do not know M’lord I
have not yet been afforded those
considerationsbut I know a
country life does not suit me

LORD MANSFIELD’s gaze is trained on JOHN DIDO has finished
gathering the books and is quietly slipping from the room

LORD MANSFIELD
The Reverend has requested I take
his son into my tutorage Dido
(Beat)
What do you think

DIDO freezes in the doorway - all eyes locked on her

INT KENWOOD HOUSE GALLERY - NIGHT 5 31

DIDO moves along the hallway lined with enormous artists’
interpretations communicating a certain lifestyle

She slows caught by one of the paintings - an English rose
stares out as a black domestic submissively fastens a
priceless bracelet around her lady-master’s wrist

DIDO’s POV CLOSE on the domestic Suddenly
JOHN
Thank you for your gracious
support
DIDO jumps - finds JOHN standing beside her
DIDO
I neither spoke for or against
you - since neither is my place

JOHN
Silence speaks volumes

Elizabeth approaches calls out as she curtseys

ELIZABETH

Papaa’s new student
JOHN

Indeed
DIDO

Mr Davinier my cousin Elizabeth
JOHN

A pleasure
DIDO

(to John)

Papaa has never taken a pupil
you realise

ELIZABETH
Someone to keep you company while
you take Papaa’s dictation Dido
(to John)

Truth is there have been more of
your sex at Kenwood this week
than I’ve previously seen in all
my entire life

DIDO flushes

JOHN
Hopefully we have not disappointed

ELIZABETH
On the contrary

She raises a minxish eyebrow and moves off Awkward silence
DIDO
Mr Davinier whatwhat is the
importance of the Zong why is

the case before Papaa’s court
the supreme court

He searches her taken aback Why is she asking him

JOHN
Well
(he struggles tentative)
It is a cargo ship

DIDO
I am aware of that

JOHN
A human-cargo ship

DIDO hesitates tentative

DIDO
Oh You said those who were
drowned

JOHN

It lost most of its slaves before

arriving at its destination
(hesitant)

Drowned - by the crew on the

captain’s order

JOHN watches as DIDO falters

DIDO
Butwhy

The SOUND of the MANSFIELDS gathering with the ASHFORDS A
maid approaches hurrying about her duties

MAID
Miss your supper is served
now in the ladies’ parlour

DIDO
Thank you

JOHN hesitates struck with confusion at the maid’s words
DIDO becomes awkward LADY MANSFIELD emerges disappearing
into the dining room

LADY MANSFIELD
Mr Davinier will you be joining
us for dinner

JOHN’s eyes dart to DIDO - sees her unease It pierces him

JOHN
IerI thank you Madam but I
am promised to the company of my
aunt this evening She has recently
moved to the cottage at Belsize

LADY MANSFIELD
Of course - as you wish

She moves off and DIDO and JOHN are left in tense silence

JOHN
Permit me to ask why you do not
dine with your family — ever

DIDO
That is not correct

JOHN
Forgive mebut twice now I have
seenI have seen you separated
from the gathering

DIDO’s cheeks begin to burn

JOHN (CONTD)
I am confounded

DIDO snaps her shame over-spilling

DIDO
And well you might be - when the
son of clergy is permitted to the
table before a lady of the house

JOHN
Is that a reminder of my place
Miss Lindsay

She holds back frustrated tears pained

DIDO
No It’s a statement of mine

Both of them are smarting JOHN moves off stung

EXT KENWOOD HOUSE DIDO AND ELIZABETH’S BEDROOM NIGHT5 32

DIDO steps into the room expressionless She sits on the
chaise longue allows her gaze to settle on her reflection

Something terrible resonates through her - some awful
thought or feeling that leaves her breathless with
emotion And then her fingers come up to the skin on her
chestand she begins to pinch and pull with self-hatred
rubbing the heel of her palm across her cheek her
forehead as her face crumples and she begins to cry

EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH DAY 6 33

New day LORD MANSFIELD and JOHN ride through Kenwood’s
lands on horseback slowing under the shade of trees

JOHN
(he pats his animal)
There is much speculation on your
decision Anticipation seems to
be turning to panic m’lord

LORD MANSFIELD
I cannot disagree

JOHN

One hundred and thirty two drowned
on route from Africa to the West
Indies Your ruling could bring
the slave trade to its knees -
entirely destroy an economic
foundation of these lands

(off Mansfield)
Is that pressure not maddening
m’ lord

LORD MANSFIELD reigns in his horse He quotes in Latin

LORD MANSFIELD
Justitia fiat ruat coelum Mr
Davinier - Let justice be done
though the heavens may fall

JOHN
The insurance claim states the
slaves were thrown overboard for
the safety of the ship - that
there wasnt sufficient water for
the cargo and crew to survive the
rest of the voyage

LORD MANSFIELD

It does

JOHN
Then if I am correct the case
hangs on

LORD MANSFIELD
-IT HANGS on ‘Absolute

necessity’ If the cargo was
spoiled

JOHN
Cargo

LORD MANSFIELD adjusts his language

LORD MANSFIELD
If the killing of thenegros was
truly ‘necessary’ in order to save
the ship - as the captain contends

A difficult silence JOHN is careful but sceptical

JOHN
Butis that where it hinges

LORD MANSFIELD does not welcome the challenge

LORD MANSFIELD
The ships journey was thwarted
by impossible weather conditions -
what should have been weeks
became months What once appeared
enough water may not have been

JOHN
I am sensible of this mlord

LORD MANSFIELD

Then do you know what a hundred
thirsty slaves are capable of I
can tell you no man happily
disposes of his cargo even in
the face of rebellion

(O£f Johns silence)
So now tell me - were you to
dock at port with barely a piece
of merchandise left to trade -—
what would you do Swallow
financial ruin - or claim your
due from the insurers

John is conflicted - to speak up or not

JOHN
With due respect I should
question whether human life
should have been insurable as
cargo - at all

The air turns cold

EXT KENWOOD GARDENS DAY 6 34

LADY MARY clips flowers from a bush of sunset pink Dahlias
DIDO holds a basket collecting them LADY MANSFIELD and
ELIZABETH stroll beneath parasols

LORD MANSFIELD and JOHN can be seen approaching the stables
on horseback - JOHN trailing

LADY MARY
A gentleman rather like him once
paid me much interest

ELIZABETH
Mr Davinier

LADY MANSFIELD
(matter of fact)
Really Mary

DIDO lays each Dahlia carefully

LADY MARY
Do not look at me like that It was
my Mamaa who intervened I thought
he had a very great sense of duty
Overly kind at times but

LADY MANSFIELD watches as though she knows the rest

DIDO
(gently)

Butwhat Aunt Mary

LADY MARY hesitates and LADY MANSFIELD cuts in saving her

LADY MANSFIELD
HE is engaged you know

DIDO follows her gaze to JOHN as he climbs from the horse
hands it to a STABLEMAN

LADY MARY
Engaged

ELIZABETH
Is he

LADY MANSFIELD
Mr Beresford’s daughter

Through a half open doorway his POV DIDO sits on stool
before ZOFFANY The sight draws JOHN to a halt

He attempts to move off - but cant He observes DIDO
quietly She is somehow tranquil under Zoffany’s gaze

A beat before her eyes fall on JOHN’S outline in the
doorway - his stare penetrating and compelling

ON ZOFFANY - he follows DIDO’S gaze to JOHN Then he
sketches madly filling in DIDO’S eyes in great detail

ON JOHN embarrassed - he moves away quickly DIDO is
affected She jumps up Goes after him

As ELIZABETH’S eyes follow uncertain

DIDO
Wait

She is upon him in the CORRIDOR They stand silent awkward

JOHN
II was curious

DIDO
Quite a task - to sit for so many
hours (beat)
Congratulations I learned of
youryour match yesterday

JOHN
Thank you

He falters slightly swallows hard - not all is well

Her eyes hone in on a pamphlet under his arm JOHN shifts
uneasy at what it shows - the last few letters of THE ZONG

can be seen and LORD MANSFIELD depicted with large butt

DIDO
I appear the only one to have
just learned of this affair

JOHN
Perhaps yours is a life less
concerned with such matters

DIDO
Why do you judge me so

He studies her She is tentative

DIDO (CONTD)
It is a fact that I have
contemplated on the matter for
many hours and II do not
think the slaves could have been
drowned in the way you say

ON his disbelief - irritation slowly turns to dawning
JOHN

Are you at utter disconnect from
everything

He searches her making her feel very small and ashamed

he moves off she stares after him distressed

DIDO
Mr Davinierplease Tell me
Tell me what you know

He stops stares back at her What to do

DIDO (CONTD)
(earnest)
Do not render me your amusement

He traces her vulnerability It roots him

JOHN
I can only tell you what I believe

DIDO
(trying to understand)
And whatwhat is that

JOHN
The slaves were intentionally
drowned that is not in question
Chained Thrown into the waters -
chained together as one

(MORE)

As

JOHN (CONTD)
They were diseased - worth more as
dead insured merchandise than as
alive spoiled goods
(stark)
The captain hoped it would ‘pay’
to kill them

ON DIDO as colour drains from her face Nausea rises

His eyes try to read hers becoming sensitive As he moves
back towards her She struggles to take it in

JOHN (CONTD)
Miss Lindsay

DIDO
But the insurers are appealing

JOHN
Yes They are challenging the
decision of the lower court —
refusing to pay for murdered
slaves

Her eyes sting JOHN can see she is having difficulty - he
touches her hand absentmindedly startling her but their
eyes remain locked She attempts weakly to return self-
possession Then almost a whisper

DIDO
Thank you

That is thank you for telling me what nobody else has

She turns walks away ON DIDO as her pace quickens

moves urgently to the next pamphlet and the next

drowned

JOHN
Because they were Those slaves
were diseased - some were already
dying - yes But it was essential
they die ON the journey or they
would not come under insurance
consideration Neither too if
they had expired of their diseases
- That is why they were killed -
this we all know

LORD MANSFIELD
You have entered my home and
utterly taken advantage of the
confidential matters afforded you

JOHN
These ‘matters’ have been for
public consumption for months
Miss Lindsay is no childno
fool

LORD MANSFIELD

(incandescent )
Her precious care is in my hands
and I will decide when she is
ready for such realities Not the
son of a vicar A vicar who
incidently purchased his living
from me

I shall gather my belongings

LORD MANSFIELD
Do so

LORD MANSFIELD turns his back on JOHN to glare at the lawns
JOHN calmly collects his books jacket hat He hesitates

JOHN
Your Lordship a question

LORD MANSFIELD swings round ready to bite

LORD MANSFIELD
WHAT Mr Davinier

JOHN
As the mere son of a vicar - I
wonder whether the value you
extend to your very precious
mulatto niece - well I wonder if
it amounts to MOREor LESS than
the thirty pounds insurance the
traders are asking for each life
they murdered

ON LORD MANSFIELD’S cold stare He swallows hard

Good day M’lord

That he should compromise a
ladys reputation by stepping out
with her - scarcely having made

Ah now how do I know this is not
just another tactic in your
battle to conquer

takes at the sight of her hovering at the edge of the
concert He stands alarmed negotiates his way to her

JOHN
(dismayed)
Miss Lindsay you are alone

DIDO
I did not have the chance to see
you before you leftMr Davinier
to convey my apologies

JOHN
Apologies

DIDO
Your pupilage Father would
never have ended ityouyou
never would have had to leave
Kenwood were it not

His eyes soften as he looks at her

JOHN
He would make mine a living hell
were he to know of us speaking

DIDO tugs him into a quiet lane away from the concert and
promenading

Hardly a breath and BAM She is slammed against a walled
maze suddenly JOHN pressed against her tightly

Confused her gaze darts around her finds LADY MANSFIELD
and LADY ASHFORD ambling past along a cross path oblivious

DIDO freezes - held tightly against JOHN She stares
panicked into his eyes and he into hers

615CUTAWAY So they do not see ELIZABETH as she strolls by
with JAMES - Her gaze falling on JOHN and DIDO instantly

ELIZABETH is stunned But doesn’t falter

614 CONT’D As DIDO and JOHN look back - nothing but
anonymous strangers leaving them none the wiser to being
discovered JOHN pulls away embarrassed

JOHN (CONTD)
Forgive me

She nods equally bashful They regard each other

DIDO
What are you doing here in London
Mr Davinier

JOHN
I am under a third cousin - a
solicitor here Nothing more
than petty disputes between
unsavoury landlords and debauched
tenants but I cannot discount it

DIDO
Not what you wished for

JOHN
I havent given up on The Inns
Nothing worth having in life
comes easily

DIDO
(flushed)
Where are my manners I trust
the future Mrs Davinier is well

JOHN
very wellthank you
DIDO is unexpectedly struck - recovers herself

DIDO
I have tried to keep up - with
the Zong These past weeks

JOHN
(agitated)
Tis pitiful Such inability to
simply know what value to put on
anothers life

DIDO
(bitterly)
What price a worthless Negro

JOHN

(frustrated)
You utterly misunderstand me
I am saying that no man may have
the value of that of cargo
Human beings cannot be priced
since we are priceless Freemen
and slaves alike

Her eyes begin to sting at the ‘integrity’ in his words

JOHN (CONTD)
(enthused)
I am with others here We are
all students in law - applying
pressure on the insurance companies
to refuse from here on to insure
slaves on any ship A simple clause

DIDO
But that would require a change
of law I know nothing but

JOHN

A change in law - something the
insurance companies can lobby for
IF they can be persuaded to band
together

(softly )
We may only be students
butchange is most always
precipitated by the young

(shrugs - poignant)
Someone has to have the courage
How can we expect to be civilised
if we live in a barbaric world

His words wind her as JOHN shakes his head frustrated She

takes him in - he is so very handsome
JOHN (CONTD)
It is the utter injusticethe
industrial slaughter of so many

DIDO stares at him earnestly
DIDO
No It is more than that It’s
the shame of a law that would
uphold a financial transaction
upon that atrocity
She is scathing and accepting all at once affecting him

JOHN
That is indeed the truth

Their eyes are locked An intimate beat that perturbs her

DIDO
I have never heard anyone speak
like you

JOHN

Nor I you Miss Lindsay
He is emotional it perturbs him too now
JOHN (CONTD)
You must return They will be
anxious Should I follow to see
you safely

DIDO
No we cannot risk it

He nods - studies her

JOHN
Good bye Miss Lindsay

I suspect we will never see each
other again

The thought strikes DIDO uneasily

DIDO

searching hard for OLIVER or the others Her pace quickens as
a hand comes down on her shoulder taking her breath away

Mansfield without you

Satisfaction washes over her As DIDO and OLIVER appear LADY

it will therefore fall upon

Your situation can attract so
much better James She brings
nothing but name A real lady is
blessed with SO much more

OLIVER
(sardonic)
Do you hear that James A lady’s
good breeding alone will not do

LADY ASHFORD
(to Oliver)
Your brother needs a wife who
will bring him further land

LOTS if he is ever to exert
more political influence than your
father has

JAMES

But what of her own father

LADY ASHFORD
The Seventh Viscount Stormont is a
scoundrel Ensconced in Vienna
with the girl’s vicious step-mamaa
and his new offspring - who I am
told is to inherit EVERYTHING

She shakes her head stares through the carriage window

LADY ASHFORD (CONT’D)

I must say pen-ni-less
Thankfully her cousin is not
It is true that on each occasion
I lay eyes upon that girl she
becomes more beautiful

OLIVER shifts perturbed - DIDO indeed on his mind

JAMES
She has the colouring of a farmer

LADY ASHFORD
James we do not talk about that
any longer

JAMES
Is this really the very best you
aspire to Oliver To introduce
some woman of obscure birth into
the family lineage

LADY ASHFORD

James - you are my first boy -
blessed by law to inherit your
father’s wealth Be sympathetic
to your brother Like the
unfortunate Miss Murray - a good
family name and empty pockets
will only get him so far

it was too diseased to achieve a

on your adopted girl

Which one

LORD ASHFORD
You have raised a lovely young
ladyAnd though I understand she
is kept under interesting rules
She raises questions

LORD MANSFIELD
Spit it out

LORD ASHFORD
Her introduction to society comes
at a key time in the insurance
appeal Parliament is nervous that
your ‘family situation’ will
colour your judgement

LORD MANSFIELD
I will neither be pressured from
the inside - or the outside

LORD ASHFORD comes to a stop

LORD ASHFORD
(calm)
You are the highest judge in the
land

LORD ASHFORD (CONTD)
In you they see a man who is of
the persuasion and position to
bring down the major trade of our
time and the commercial health of
this country Some will say next
to our king you are the most
powerful man in England And the
same will ask how you our Chief
Justice can be fair

LORD MANSFIELD
How RULES are in place to
dictate how we live — were that
not the case I would not have
had the mandate to give shelter
to my nephew’s child

He struggles with his emotion

LORD MANSFIELD (CONT’D)
She is his blood - MINE And
rightfully had entitlement to
grow up on the family estate

(aggrieved)

The parliamentarians may challenge
me - let them I can tell you all
if the law supports the Zong’s
slave owners as strongly as Murray
blood runs through Dido Belle’s
veins - make no mistake - the
insurers will be forced to pay up

LORD ASHFORD is affected He regards LORD MANSFIELD

He raises an eyebrow Then

LORD ASHFORD (CONT’D)
I have reason to speak with you
on another matter

LORD MANSFIELD
Oh

LORD ASHFORD
(tentative)
I have a wish to seal the bond

ON DIDO as OLIVER chats to others She moves past as

LADY ASHFORD
A pity Lady Mansfield and I could not
do business on James and Miss Murray

LADY MARY
A greater pity you rejected her

LADY ASHFORD
Let us not dwell on the
unfortunate Oliver and Miss
Lindsay are a blissful match
Tell me when exactly does she
receive her inheritance

As DIDO observes her reflection in waters - easy laughter
floats by - a group of gentleman josh

A figure beside her turns - icy blue stare takes her in as
she meets his gaze and finds herself staring into the eyes
of JAMES ASHFORD

JAMES ASHFORD

Miss Lindsay Not Husband
hunting are we

(off Didos disdain)
Good Lord I forgot - you have
ensnared my brother Now is he to
share his dining room with you as
well as his bed

His words bury deep and painful

DIDO
Oh Mr James your manners are as
poor as your brother’s finances

JAMES
And you are foolish enough to marry
him I on the other have no better
use for your impoverished
cousin(beat)Though she does
make for rather amusing sport

She follows his gaze through trees to ELIZABETH breathing
in the scent of the azaleas beside MR VAUGHAN The joshing
gentlemen trickle away leaving only DIDO and JAMES

She goes to move off JAMES grabs her arm spitefully

DIDO
That is painful sir

JAMES
Have you never been manhandled

DIDO
It is not in my repertoire to
keep company with beasts

He regards her - her disdain reflected in his eyes His
free hand comes up fingers rest on her lips then spread
as he crushes her beauty in his hand

Her eyes fill as he brings her close So close She is
afraid angry She struggles desperately spirited both
arousing and alarming him As she tears herself from him

DIDO (CONTD)
How dare you HOW DARE YOU

He stares at her - takes her in calmly Then

JAMES
With ease

DIDO wavers nauseous with contempt JAMES moves off She
watches incensed humiliated

ELIZABETH strolls with MR VAUGHAN as JAMES passes OLIVER
he whispers to his brother

JAMES (CONTD)
You will destroy us You will destroy
the entire order of our family
Nearby DIDO emerges from the trees

LADY ASHFORD

Her eyes dart suspiciously to JAMES as he approaches

LORD MANSFIELD
Whether the ‘jettison clause’ of

to bear in this appeal This is
the question That is first
whether the slaves were drowned

avoid the disease caused by their

journey killing them once on shore
and at their destinationdepriving
the slave owners of any compensation

He takes in the gaze of a free black man in the gallery

LORD MANSFIELD (CONT’D)
Or secondly whether they were
‘jettisoned’ as cargo To save
captain and crew from certain death
when the extended journey threatened
shortage of drinking-water

(steely eyed)
Let me be clear loss of water on a
ship constitutes a singularly
dangerous affair - insurrection of
thirsty and hostile slaves at its
extreme —- and an impossible task to
share diminished water reserve among
all those living at best Each
implies severe threat to the lives of
the seamen In such circumstances our
law is transparent and equivocal -
the jettisoning of enslaved cargo
I8 legal
(he spells it out)

And in these circumstances combined
with unavoidable loss of water our
laws leave the ship-owners securely
within their rights to make a claim
and behoves the insurers to pay
losses

DIDO
No

‘packing fashion’ to transport
the slavesA popular fashion of
transportation that is known for
causing death and disease

His voice is raised over the sounds of a chaotic court

LORD MANSFIELD (CONT’D)
This choice of laying the slaves
tightly together is undertaken at
the Captain’s own risk In the
event that over packing renders
an avoidable lack of drinking water
on board a protracted journey
such a decision may be viewed as
simple ‘bad management’ on a

from a ship into the waters to
prevent those lives dying on land
and to facilitate insurance
compensation Whether they be the
lives of horses or human beings
Slaves or otherwise - It is
not legal neither is it right

DIDO lets out a gasp - breathless relief

LORD MANSFIELD (CONT’D)
Further the claim of shortage of
water is illegitimate shown by the
evidence put forward To my
mind it is clear a fraud has been
committed in claiming insurance on
slaves who weredrowned solely
for financial gain

He looks around the room - sees LORD ASHFORD’s acceptance

His eyes fall on DIDO now and here they remain

LORD MANSFIELD (CONT’D)
It is my opinion that the state of
slavery is so odious a position that
nothing may support it This case
has displayed with searing clarity
the depravity of any such nation
whose choice is to practice it You
may be certain that I have laboured
over my judgement and statements
today and am in full understanding
of all of the ramifications Justice
be donethough the heavens may fall

JOHNS eyes brim at the realisation of those words

LORD MANSFIELD (CONTD)
I find in favour of the insurers
and overturn the decision of the
lower court I order a retrial

Stunned confusion in the courtroom Then all kinds of

commotion - anger cheers amid shock LORD MANSFIELD stands

CLERK
All rise

JOHN jumps up desperate for eye contact through the
commotionbut LORD MANSFIELD fixes ahead moves off
DIDO stands caught by her own breath JOHN turns to her
She begins to sob For the first time he pulls her close

WIDE on the court room - JOHN holding DIDO as she sobs

Through the judges’ exit - a figure in the shadows REVEAL
LORD MANSFIELD taking in DIDO and JOHN affected

EXT WESTMINSTER HALL STREETS - DAY26 124

JOHN watches as DIDO races back to the carriage ON their
reaction - LORD MANSFIELD stands waiting

As DIDO and LORD MANSFIELD come before each other Everything
in their eyes - restrained emotion over a long beat

DIDO
You may not blame Mr Davinier
My attendance today is
absolutely at my own volition
for matters which concern me

LORD MANSFIELD
I am fully aware Dido

He fixes on JOHN JOHN is apprehensive
JOHN
MLordI am inspired by your
decision today We will not go
backwards from here

LORD MANSFIELD

(burdened)
History will judge if your
optimism is warranted(beat)

You are a man of conviction
JOHN swallows hard emotion rising stinging his eyes

JOHN
I am trying to be

LORD MANSFIELD
Then your efforts are not in vain

DIDO moves to JOHN’S side taking his hand LORD
MANSFIELD’s eyes drop to their clasped fingers

LORD MANSFIELD (CONTD)
I have not changed my mind She
is to marry a gentleman

He turns and begins to move to the carriage JOHN stares
at the ground humiliated DIDO is incensed

DIDO
And Mr Davinier is not a gentleman

Her voice rings out furious LORD MANSFIELD stops

LORD MANSFIELD
He isindeedDido
(he speaks carefully)
And that is why he ought to have
a job befitting one

DIDO
(a whisper - defiant)
My affections are with him Papaa
I wish for nothing
nothing if not to be his wife

She stares into LORD MANSFIELD’s eyes - he takes in JOHN

LORD MANSFIELD
If you would Mr Davinier I would
like you to attend my chambers in
the morning There are matters I
would like you to assist me with

JOHN
Your Lordship

LORD MANSFIELD
And if you think it a good
ideaI wish to facilitate
your entry to the Inns of Court

JOHN
(tentative)
That is to serve my qualification
to The Bar

The question LORD MANSFIELD once put to JOHN is now answered
LORD MANSFIELD
Indeed (humbled)Capabilities
such as yours are clearly
deserving of such considerations
JOHN breathes heavily also humbled as his tears surface

JOHN
II think it a very good idea sir

LORD MANSFIELD nods then finally moves off JOHN can’t
take it in DIDO is breathless eyes brim

JOHN (CONTD)
Can it be true
DIDO
Of course He sees what I see
His words were as clear as

JOHN
No That your feelings for me are
so That you would be my wife
(off her reaction )

Because I cannot conceive of a
life without youand ifif
such were all that were before
me Miss Lindsay then my heart
would never beat the same again

DIDO
It is not It is not all that is
before you Mr Davinier
(begins sobbing) I love youfor
all that you are and with
allall that I am

He breaks down now too wiping her tears before kissing her

through his own sobs

Then tears turn to laughter

We draw back on the couple - two fragile figures amid the
bustle of London town

ON the MANSFIELD crest as LORD MANSFIELD’S carriage moves
off a solitary figure inside staring straight ahead
