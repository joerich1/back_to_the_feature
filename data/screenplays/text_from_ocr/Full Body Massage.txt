DISSOLVE TO
2 EXT PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY — HIGH ANGLE — DAY

A Gods-eye view of a long winding stream of traffic
curling along the coastline wrapping itself around the
Santa Monica Mountains flowing north to who can say where

Somewhere in the middle of it all little more than a
droplet in the stream is a CADILLAC ALLANTE CONVERTIBLE
with its top down

CUT TO
3 IE CADILLAC ALLANTE — MOVING — DAY

As the California sun beats brilliantly down as the rush
of wind eddies and swirls inside the car we take our place
directly behind the driver

From here there is little to be learned about the driver
other than the obvious fact that she is a woman For a
moment we see nothing of the world other than her wind-
blown hair billowing and curling And so the mystery of
who she is and why we are traveling with her only deepens

Then abruptly VARIOUS CUTS of her hands on the wheel of
the speedometer of her hand on the stickshift etc
Occasionally we sweep up to the mountains or down to the
ocean or past the fence of some tony piece of real estate
overlooking the water But always we return to our point
of departure — behind the driver speeding up the Pacific
Coast Highway

EXT COUNTRY ROAD — DAY

The Cadillac Allante rolls silently toward us before
turning into a driveway that leads up the hill toa
contemporary house

CUT TO
EXT CONTEMPORARY HOUSE — DAY

Pitched on a rolling hillside more evocative of Provence
than Malibu is the dramatic sharply angular two-story with
its eclectic exterior mix of corrugated walls and mirrored
glass

As Allante approaches on the driveway we begin to sense
something slightly askew about this house and this place
and not all of it has to do with architecture

CUT TO
EXT ALLANTE — DAY

The drivers door opens and out swivels NINA 38 years old
bright attractive But more than merely intelligent she
is shrewd more than simply beautiful she is alluring

And perhaps more to the point she is shy about neither

So one senses power as she rises out of the car just as
one senses insight as she takes a long penetrating look
around just as one sees poise and grace as she glides
toward the house

CUT TO
NINA — MOVING
from the car up the walkway up to the front door
with the mirrored glass She slips her key into the lock
without so much as a glance at her reflected image

CUT TO
INT CONTEMPORARY HOUSE — DAY
From the dramatic slope of the roof to the exposed rafters
to the open loft-like rooms seemingly suspended in space
this house has been designed with an eclectic vengeance

Tasteful mind you But nonetheless a conspicuous scheme
a captivating diversion for the restless eye

( )

All this has long ago ceased to impress Nina who
immediately ducks inside the BEDROOM to her right and slips
off her shoes before continuing barefoot down the HALLWAY

The days mail awaits her stacked tidily on a chest midway
down the hall Taking the mail in hand she begins sorting
through it even as she ascends the short staircase to the
MAIN ENTERTAINING AREA of the house

There she stands in the middle of the floor absorbed in
some letter or other when footsteps come quickly down a
staircase and DEE DEE appears

Dee Dee a very young very eager very uncertain 24-year-
old lets out a slightly startled gasp at the sight of
Nina who looks up coolly from her letter

DEE DEE
(painfully self-conscious
perhaps with a frantic
glance at her watch)
Youre home
(suddenly talking to
herself)
Great DeeD
(just as suddenly talking
to Nina again)
I mean there you are standing right
in front of me

NINA
(doing nothing to put her
at ease)
Hello Dee Dee

DEE DEE
Hi Nina

A few tentative steps forward

DEE DEE
How was your day

NINA
Very pleasant — in a grim sort of
way

As Nina returns to her letter Dee Dee moves quickly into
the kitchen

CUT TO

INT KITCHEN — DAY 10

From a bucket of ice Dee Dee removes a chilling bottle of
white wine and pours a glass

CUT TO
INT ENTERTAINMENT AREA — DAY 11

Dee Dee now appears with a glass of wine which Nina takes
from her With the wine glass in one hand and her mail in
the other Nina sprawls leisurely on a sofa

NINA
And how were things around here

But before Dee Dee can utter even syllable Nina cuts her
off

NINA
Oh did that whats-his-name the
strange bald lawyer call

DEE DEE
No

NINA
How about Douglas — did he reconfirm
for this afternoon

DEE DEE
No no one called

NINA
If he ever does call me here its
fine to give the number for the car —
the lawyer He represents Merkey
the artist Im showing next month
Douglas already has

the number Which must mean hes
still coming — if he didnt call

DEE DEE
(not knowing if this
requires a response)
Well yeah

Nina looks up nothing like a response was either expected
or desired

( )

11
NINA
(back into the mail)
So
DEE DEE
What
NINA

How were things around here You
were about to say

DEE DEE
The gardener came

NINA
And how is Mr Li

DEE DEE
He cleared out that underbrush where
you asked about

NINA
Good

DEE DEE
Did the deep-root fertilization too

Dee Dee hovers a little too near the sofa prompting Nina
to gaze up at her expectantly

DEE DEE
I paid all the bills the checks are
on your desk you just have to sign
them And I bought some haddock from
the fishman this morning I made a
curry sauce to go with it all you
have to do is pop it in the oven I
left the directions

NINA
And youd like to go home now

Dee Dee nods sheepishly

NINA
Go

Dee Dee crosses slowly to the staircase
DEE DEE
Mr Li said he wont be back again

for three weeks He has to go to
(MORE )

( )

DEE DEE (contd)
Taiwan I think he was trying to tell
me Some family thing

NINA
No doubt

DEE DEE
He wanted to know if you wanted his
nephew to come the next two weeks

NINA
And you told him yes I hope

Dee Dee nods

NINA
Youre a good little wife Dee Dee
Every woman should have one

Taking this as a compliment she smiles and disappears
After a moment the front door opens and closes After a
moment more Nina rises with wine glass in hand and goes to
the BACK DOOR She gazes pensively through the glass
perhaps watching Dee Dee go perhaps not

The goal of the massage is to

INT HOUSE — DAY 13

Nina slips a CD into the compact disc player and we hear
the first deep barely audible bars of Albinonis Adagio
inG-Minor
As the music continues ethereally UNDER we

CUT TO
INT BEDROOM DRESSING CLOSET — DAY 14
Standing in front of a full-length mirror Nina takes a

moment to study herself in her suit her uniform if you
will

( )

After a moment after drinking off a little too much wine
for one sip she puts the glass to one side Then without
taking her eyes off herself she begins removing her
clothes

It is a slow and sultry dance and her eyes rapt
hypnotically never leave the mirror as she slides out of
her skirt her blouse her nylons her bra
Only gradually does it occur to us that there may be
something other than prurience at stake here This strip
is not a tease but a conscious peeling away of layer upon
layer of her well-ordered well-practiced life If she
stares its only because she is making certain that
absolutely nothing of her accustomed life is left
Once all her clothes are off she takes another moment to
study herself Then after retrieving a robe from an
adjoining bathroom she starts into the hallway

CUT TO
EXT HOUSE — JACUZZI — DAY 15
She tests the steaming bubbling water with the graze of a
foot Then dropping her robe she eases her body down
penetrating the water until she is submerged to the neck
Allowing her head to fall gently back she gazes heavenward
at the starry night She is drifting now her mind is
soaring across space and time

CUT TO
INT BATHROOM — DAY 16
Standing in the shower allowing the water to cascade over
him is a handsome rugged man in his middle 20s a man we
will later come to know as DOUGLAS

CUT TO
NINA 17

still in the jacuzzi still gazing heavenward still
drifting

CUT TO
EXT STREET — IN FRONT OF THE CONTEMPORARY HOUSE — DAY 18

Turning into the driveway is a SMALL UNASSUMING CAR — a
Yugo perhaps — the sort of car that must have always

( )

looked as rickety as it does now even rolling off the
assembly line

CUT TO
EXT JACUZZI — DAY 19

So far adrift is Nina that it takes her a moment to realize
that the car is pulling up the driveway But when she
finally does see the car she inches forward curiously

As she watches the car disappear around the front of the
house she reaches for her robe and climbs out of the
jacuzzi

CUT TO
EXT DRIVEWAY — DAY 20

As he slides out from behind the wheel and unbends himself
onto the driveway we get our first clear look at FITCH

At 44 he seems to be in equal parts showing his age and
hiding it Yes his face is deeply lined Yes he is as
grey as he is not Yet at the same time he is as lean
and agile as he was 20 years earlier

With hair that seems a day or two shy of its next trim and
clothing that is — in a word — utilitarian he resembles
nothing so much as the publisher of a natural foods
catalogue

From his place by the car he eyes the house for a moment
Then pushing forward the drivers seat he leans in and
dislodges a long rectangular object (his unassembled
portable massage table) that is wedged diagonally across
the interior of the car

Along with the massage table he pulls out what used to be
known as a gym bag He then glances at his watch locks
the drivers door and with massage table and bag in hand
circles around to the sidewalk leading up to the house

CUT TO
INT HOUSE — DAY 21
Nina moves quickly down the HALLWAY tying her robe as she
goes When she reaches the end she ducks into the BEDROOM
and goes to a window for a better look

EXT HOUSE — WALKWAY — DAY 26

Fitch walks deliberately toward the house his eyes
surveying the exterior the corrugated walls the
impenetrable mirrored-glass windows
CUT TO
FITCH — MOVING 27

toward ANOTHER HOUSE small rural eerily still the
perfect setting for — well who can say just what

CUT TO
EXT HOUSE — AS BEFORE — DAY 28
When Fitch reaches the front steps he removes a business
card (not his own) and matches the hand-written name
scrawled on the back of it with the name by the door He
takes another look at his watch then presses a button on
the intercom

CUT TO
INT HOUSE — HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER — DAY 29
With the push of a button Albinoni falls silent

CUT TO
INT HOUSE — FRONT DOOR — DAY 30

Nina opens the blinds and peers curiously Whomever she
was expecting Fitch is obviously not he

CUT TO
EXT FRONT DOOR — DAY 31
Fitch stands in front of the mirror-glass seeing
absolutely nothing of Nina glancing inadvertently at his
reflected image perhaps adjusting his hair slightly when

he does

CUT TO

32 INT FRONT DOOR — DAY 32
She peers at him a moment longer then

NINA
Can I help you

FITCH
(through the door)
Hi

She opens the door

NINA
(eyeing him with
suspicion)
Yes

FITCH
Im Fitch Fitch

NINA
Fitch

FITCH
Im here for your appointment

As if to introduce some physical evidence in his defense
he points to the portable massage table at his side

NINA
Wheres Douglas

FITCH
Didnt he call you He said he was —
he would — call you He
didnt call you

NINA
To tell me what

FITCH
That he couldnt make it

NINA
Douglas

FITCH
He said

Its difficult to tell which has Nina puzzled more Fitchs
presence or his appearance Whoever the much talked about

( )

32

Douglas is he definitely doesnt wear Birkenstock sandals
With sox

Nina then takes an absent-minded step back giving the
impression — more or less unintended — that she would like
Fitch to come right in
Without giving it a second thought he squeezes by her into
the house And so hes well inside before she even
realizes what has happened
FITCH
So where would you like me to set up
Nina

Without waiting for a response Fitch starts for the
adjoining bedroom but Nina intercepts him

NINA
Were usually this way

She extends a hand indicating the end of the hallway is
their intended direction of travel With a bemused shake
of the head Nina closes the front door and follows

CUT TO
OMIT 33
INT HALLWAY — DAY 34
As she closes the door Fitch confidently walks to the end
of the hallway and turns into the large open studio
Seeing him disappear she takes off after him

CUT TO
OMIT 35
INT STUDIO — DAY 36
Fitch is already in the middle of the room by the time Nina
appears in the doorway He puts his massage items to one

side and begins to wander curiously through the room
examining things that he comes across

NINA
Where is he do you know

FITCH
Who

( )

36

NINA
Douglas

FITCH
Didnt come up

He picks up a book that he finds lying on a table She
crosses to him and takes it from him

NINA
The Sun Also Rises
FITCH
I liked it
A brief beat then
NINA

You see Im really very
accustomed to him — Douglas

Fitch nods a small noncommittal nod

NINA
I like him

Fitch nods again

NINA
I really like him

Fitch nods yet again
NINA
And it takes time — for a woman at
least — it takes time getting
comfortable really comfortable with
a man whos
She doesn’t finish her thought

FITCH
Dougs got the touch

He pulls open a sliding glass door that leads out to the
deck He steps outside After a moment she follows

CUT TO
ANGLE ON THE DECK 37

as Fitch appears at her side

( )

NINA
But without even picking up the phone
or

Fitch peers at her having temporarily lost the train of

thought

NINA
Douglas When you have a
relationship with someone — a
business relationship — we go back
he and I — you expect some
consideration

FITCH
He seemed to be in a rush Hes very
young

NINA
Hes not so terribly young

FITCH
No not so But he is young A lot
younger than he thinks he is anyway
Besides he could have not called
either one of us

A beat as he walks farther onto the deck drinking in the
surroundings

At this

she

NINA
Hes very talented

FITCH
He is Good-looking kid too Women
seem to go for him A lot of his
clients are women Most really

says nothing

FITCH
Outsides nice Especially if you
have some privacy And you have some
privacy

NINA
Douglas does me outside

FITCH
A little cold tonight

NINA
Where would you suggest then

( )

FITCH
Some dark and quiet place
She nods her head
FITCH
You know I was in such a hurry
getting over here Ive got my oils
and things but sheets and towels

She nods then they steps back into the house

FITCH
I left some stuff in the car

CUT TO
INT HOUSE — UPSTAIRS — DAY

Nina opens a linen closet removes the sheets and towels
that Fitch has asked for then closes the closet door

CUT TO
EXT FITCHS CAR — DAY

He removes another small bag or two from the car then
closes the trunk

CUT TO

INT STUDIO — DAY

When Nina comes back however Fitch is nowhere to be seen

CUT TO

INT HOUSE — HALLWAY — DAY

Walking out of the studio she sees the massage table just

where he left it still leaning against a wall still not
set up

Now a little curious — perhaps even a little concerned —
she starts out of the room in search of Fitch

CUT TO

NINA — MOVING 42

through the house picking up speed until she at last
walks into a bedroom where she discovers Fitch examining
some jewelry that is scattered across the top of a dresser

CUT TO
ANGLE ON THE BEDROOM 43

as Fitch turns to see Nina eyes locked on him coming
closer Without the slightest hesitation he resumes
studying the diamond bracelet that he spreads across his
palm

FITCH
Im fascinated with things That is
Im fascinated with the fascination
with things

NINA
This is my bedroom

FITCH

I thought it might be My mother had

a spectacular jewelry collection as I

recall

A dubious beat as she wonders just what he may be up to
FITCH
(sensing her distrust)
I wanted to wash up And when I
happened to walk by

She hands over the sheets and towels which forces him to
hand over the bracelet

FITCH
Well I wanted to wash up

She leads him into the bathroom which we recognize as the
one that Doug was showering in earlier

The Massage Table
The table should be tall enough
to elevate the subject toa
comfortable height

CUT TO

INT HOUSE — STUDIO — DAY 45

From a chair Nina looks on as Fitch goes about the ritual
of setting up his massage table And it is just that a

ritual

Each piece each bolt each nut and washer he

assembles with devotion and ceremony all of it perhaps as
unconscious as not

FITCH
What massage is about in the end is
healing There are ways people can
heal without drugs or words or
prayers Thats it thats the
essence

NINA
I never really gave it much thought

FITCH
Healing

NINA
Massage — in those terms I try not
to intellectualize things too much
It makes life so grey Im more
intuitive I think

She watches as Fitch again immerses himself in his ritual

then

NINA
How old are you
FITCH
(smiling)
Why do you ask
NINA

I dont know why not ask I mean
you never learn anything without
asking do you

FITCH

(still smiling)
Older than you

( )

45

She is now staring at him as we

CUT TO

A PARK-LIKE PLACE 46

where a BEARDED MAN approximately Fitchs age assembles
an easel with the same sense of ritual and attention The
man looks up when we hear

FITCH
(vo)
The laying on of hands — theres
power in it

CUT TO
THE SUN ROOM — AS BEFORE 47

Fitch looks up briefly from his work seeing her staring at
him But clearly he doesnt give it a second thought as
he once more focuses his attention on the table

FITCH
But in our culture there are so
many Western prejudices about illness
and healing Were really pretty
tight-assed medically speaking
Just think about it when was the
last time your doctor actually
touched you not probed or examined
but touched you

NINA
If it never happened it was too
recent I dont like doctors — mine
or anyone elses

FITCH
Because they consult with you they
talk with you over the phone they
prescribe drugs for you But they
dont actually — personally — heal
you They leave that up to time or
chemistry

NINA
I dont like doctors because I
dont like doctors

A beat then

( )

47

NINA
Youve known Doug for how long

Fitch shrugs Doug is a topic of conversation that he can
either take or leave And right now he feels more like
leaving it than taking it

NINA
Long enough to like him
FITCH
How longs that
(beat)
It goes back to the ancients you
know
NINA
Whats that
FITCH

Massage Maybe even earlier some
historians think The Greeks were
into massage mainly as a treatment a
healing art Theyve got records of
people like Socrates and Plato being
massaged daily And Plato lived to

be 104
NINA
Socrates did not
FITCH
(undeterred)

But the Romans being who they were —
essentially Italians without the
loafers — they were the first to come
up with the idea of massage as a form
of foreplay Courtesans got pretty
handy at it It was part of the
transaction finally

NINA
Well its not like you have to have
a degree in molecular biology to see
a connection Massage is sexual
Very sexual

FITCH

It can be It doesnt have to be
It shouldnt always be

( )

47

NINA
I wasnt talking about sweating
screaming orgasmic epiphany Its
just that youre lying there naked
someones touching you in places you
sure wouldnt let your father touch
you and its arousing

FITCH
Its a form of communication You
just have to make sure youre both
speaking the same language

Fitch makes a few final adjustments to the table

Seeing that he is nearly finished Nina she sheds her robe
It takes a moment for her to locate a towel during which
time Fitch gets an eyeful

He says nothing She says nothing But neither her
complete lack of embarrassment nor his utter professional
disinterest strikes us as entirely authentic Finally
spotting her towel she draws it carelessly around herself

Fitch stands up

NINA
Looks like were ready to start

FITCH
Weve already started

NINA
What do you mean

Fitch reaches for his massage tool bag and begins
removing items

FITCH
Well most of any massage worth having
takes place in your head And Im sure
youve been preparing —
(suddenly a thought
occurs to him)
Why are you in a hurry

Before she can reply he pulls an extremely odd and not
easily explained item out of his bag of tricks He holds
it up for her to see

FITCH
Funny thing hunh

( )

47

He puts that item back and pulls out one or two more

FITCH
You might want to have some music
What was that music you were playing
before you turned it off

NINA
Ill find something

She crosses out of the room After a moment he follows
her

CUT TO
INT HALLWAYENTERTAINMENT AREA 48
From the doorway Fitch watches as she climbs the stairs
and goes to the stereo system Its only when she makes
her music selection and turns back that she sees him

looking at her

A puzzling slightly unsettling beat then

ANGLE ON THE MASSAGE TABLE 51

Nina now lies prone on the table Fitch is from all
appearances ready to go to work He peels back the towel
so that it doesnt quite cover her butt

FITCH
So what are we working on Nina

( )

51

FITCH
Any complaints maladies any part of
your body that needs special
attention

NINA
The part that begins at my hair and
ends at my toes

From his bag he removes an impressive assortment of
bottles and jars He selects one then begins applying oil
in long slow sweeping strokes until the whole of her back
is slick and glistening

CUT TO
A SERIES OF SHOTS — THE ART OF THE MASSEUR 52
Hands float fingers unfold forearms bunch
biceps flex shoulders tauten as IN and OUT OF FRAME

his body glides with power and grace

Watching we are witness to nothing short of Fitchs
complete mastery of his art he is nothing short of the
Baryshnikov of massage

CUT TO
A PAIR OF HANDS 53

Younger Slightly more muscular Noticeably less
accomplished Decidedly less poetic More ballroom than
ballet More James T Farrell than Marcel Proust

And when the CAMERA moves slowly BACK we see that it is
not Fitch massaging Nina but the handsome rugged man
Douglas

Every now and then she lets out a small involuntary sigh
which after a time begins to sound very much like a moan
This goes on for a moment or two growing in intensity
until the spell is broken by

NINA
(os)
Its my job you know

CUT TO

ANGLE ON THE MASSAGE TABLE 54

Fitch continues with warm luxurious circulating strokes
beginning at the small of her back and flowing up to her
shoulder blades

NINA
You were going to say something about
how tense I am

Maybe he was More likely he was undergoing some out-of-
body experience so deep is his concentration on the area
of her back that he massages

NINA
Douglas always does Hes always
telling me how much tension I have
Especially in my upper back my
shoulders Its all because of my
work

A beat of expectation as she waits for him to question her
about her work Then when he does not when he simply
continues massaging her in intense silence she answers
anyway

NINA
I own a gallery A couple of them
actually One here in town off
Melrose Another in New York
Tribeca And when its your business
your baby — well you know what they
say about responsibility falling on
your shoulders It does — literally

A beat then

FITCH
Its best not to talk so much

NINA
Was I talking too much

FITCH
Well its your massage You can do
anything youd like But you really
should take some time to relax I
mean you cant keep going all the
time Or is that what the people you
work with do

( )

54

NINA
The people I work with limit their
relaxation to what they can purchase
in a vial

After he performs a series of long deep strokes she
visibly loosens up She seems to be taking his advice
Half-joking he lifts one of her feet and lets it drop to
the table

FITCH
Working already see

CUT TO
THE PARK-LIKE PLACE 55

where the bearded man paints at an easel The painting
that he labors at is perhaps more naturalistic than what is
fashionable these days The work is nevertheless
accomplished

Just then Nina drives by in her CAR For some reason the
sight of the man at his easel captures her imagination
She makes a u-turn and drives back

After a moment she is out of the car and over his
shoulder He turns surprised to see anyone anywhere near
him She continues studying the painting even as he
studies her

PAINTER
(as he continues painting)
So what do you think of it

Nina gives an approving nod of the head

CUT TO
ANGLE ON THE MASSAGE TABLE 56
After a brief contempative beat —
NINA
How long have you been doing massage
Fitch
FITCH

Almost 20 years — off and on

NINA
Interesting work Im sure you meet
all kinds of people Gives you a lot
(MORE)

( )

NINA (contd)
of freedom too I bet I mean its
so portable have table will
travel

A brief beat then

NINA
I travel a lot — in my work Too
much Im starting to think I guess
it just depends how badly you want
what you want

Another brief beat then

NINA
Do you like art You seem like the
sort of person who does

FITCH
And what sort of person is that

NINA
Well an
(catching herself)
What do you mean

FITCH
(more musing than
argumentative)
Just that I never thought there was a
type thats all But I suppose
youd know more about that than I

would
NINA
Well do you enjoy art
FITCH
(after a moment of
consideration)

Who do you consider to be the great
artists of this century

NINA
How do you mean

FITCH
I mean who are the five greatest — or
four — or three

NINA
Im really not in that business

( )

56

FITCH
Would you say Picasso Would he be
one Or maybe Chagall —

NINA
- I dont think you can quantify
artistic achievement -

FITCH
- or would you say Braque or Klee

NINA
Whats your point Fitch

Instead of replying Fitch retreats for a moment again
massaging her in silence His strokes now become a tease —
although from all appearances an inadvertent one — as his
hands move nearer and nearer her ass

Finally in a series of deep slow strokes he slips his
hands under the towel and withdraws them then slips them
under again — to which she visibly succumbs Her eyelids
close heavily

CUT TO

now in Fitchs place leaning over the massage table as

his movements more or less echo the strokes that Fitch has
just performed

on the table as she sighs deeply

CUT TO
ANGLE ON THE MASSAGE TABLE 59

Nina emerges slowly from her reverie

NINA
What was it you were going to say

No response
NINA

You were going to say something and
then you just stopped

( )

When there is still no response she looks up to see that
Fitch is gone Then as she slides off the table to go in
search of him she hears a strange CLICKING sound coming
from the hallway

CUT TO
INT HALLWAY — DAY

Returning from his car Fitch is clicking together TWO
LARGE MAGNETS as he walks down the hall Suddenly a
painting hanging on the wall catches his eye Its about
then that Nina emerges from the studio

FITCH
This is just me now this is just my
opinion But so much of what passes for
art today — contemporary art — is without
any kind of reference point moral
historic nothing Its not about
anything

NINA
Oh I disagree Modern art is
critical Thats what makes it
modern
CUT TO
THE PARK-LIKE SETTING

The bearded painter sits at the easel preparing his palette
as Nina continues to linger over his shoulder

NINA
Where do you show

The painter laughs

CUT TO
INT HALLWAY — AS BEFORE
Nina sees the magnets

NINA
What are those

FITCH
(deadpan )
I dont know I just found them in
the trunk of my car

( )

62

She looks askance at him she takes him at his word

FITCH
Theyre magnets

NINA
Magnets

FITCH

About 400 gauss potency — perfect for
those hard-to-treat areas

Without pausing to explain further he moves into the
kitchen

CUT TO
INT KITCHEN 63

Nina follows Fitch in as he crosses to the stove There
he turns on a burner and begins warming the magnets

Then as she looks on with a mixture of curiosity and
apprehension —

NINA
You really must visit my gallery
Weve got a very interesting
installation coming up next month I
think you should see

FITCH
And whats that

NINA
A history of womens fashion as a
form of bondage

Fitch cocks an amused eyebrow
NINA
Come and see it I think youll
enjoy it It has a certain point of
view Its funny Ironic Satiric

FITCH
A point of view

NINA
Exactly

( )

63

FITCH
Ill tell you — and this is why so
much of art today is so pointless I
think — what we suffer from our
society is a kind of bankruptcy of
spirit

NINA
Im sure people have said something like
as long as there have been people to say
it

FITCH
Except this time its true

few steps behind him Taking note the massage chair by the
window he crosses to it

FITCH
Is this yours

She nods He indicates that she should sit in it which
she does He then kneels before her placing a warmed
magnet beneath either of her feet

NINA
Fear of change Fear of the future

Bad faith
NINA
What is
FITCH
Blaming someone else — something else
— technology — as if we had no
responsibility for ourselves our
actions
NINA
So what would you suggest
FITCH
I suggest we look inward all of us
for starters And then I suggest we
look outward
NINA
And then do we all sit cross-legged
on the floor humming like gnats
FITCH
We might We could Why not Or
else we could just go out and kill

resembling nothing so much as controlled violence

Yet the harder he massages her the more she grunts and
groans and gasps for breath and — from all indications —
just generally enjoys herself

Although Fitch continues his acupressure strong and hard

the mood — in contrast to Nina and Douglas — seems
downright pacific

Fitch shakes

Gone now Theyve been dead a while

Call it what you like The essence
is that weve lost our way Asa

FITCH
Although there is the matter of
compensation

NINA

People understand that when they come to
me Usually thats why they come to
me Artists are rarely as troubled by
the idea of their earning a living as
everyone else seems to be

78

FITCH
(puzzled)
So then whats the spiritual side
to your work

But before she can respond the strength of his acupressure causes
her to exhale hoarsely suddenly

FITCH
(as he persists in
applying pressure)
This isnt too hard for you Nina

NINA
(breathless)
Why do you ask

Fitch lays off on the acupressure smoothing over the area
with lush soothing strokes

NINA
I had aspirations artistic
aspirations Except that I saw
myself up onstage somewhere a
performer Only problem was I
couldnt sing or dance I could
audition I mean my gift is I know
how to sell and so I sold myself
And in rehearsal come to think of
it I was okay passable

FITCH
Would I have ever seen you in
anything

NINA

No Lucky man

She laughs at this But if what she says is an
exaggeration there clearly remains some element of truth
to it

NINA
It was in school mostly But once
or twice in an otherwise
professional theatre I actually got
up in front of a paying audience
and made them pay

CUT TO
ANGLE ON FITCH AND NINA 86
In contrast Fitchs contact with her strikes us as far
more sexual — superficially at least — than Douglass
But appearances can as they say be deceiving
For as erotic as this foot massage may seem it is for
Fitch far more transcendental than sexual Once more his
eyes close his mind soars and his hands seem to assume a
will and intelligence of their own

With Fitch continuing to stroke her feet Nina is very
nearly purring — until she is jarred back to reality by her
own hyperactive intellect

NINA
I like what I do where Ive ended
up who I am It gives me an

enormous amount of satisfaction

A brief beat then

( )

NINA
Are you happy Fitch
FITCH
Happy
NINA

You said youve spent all this time
traveling around I was just
wondering if it made you happy

FITCH
Its made me a better person Sure
I suppose Happier than most people
If thats what its about

Nina seems puzzled

FITCH
Theres more to happiness than being
happy

NINA

Meaning what

Suddenly we are back into the foot massage with it near-
eroticism in CLOSE UP

We take a beat then

FITCH
You see with most people — cultures
— civilizations — this idea of
happiness — its not some frivolous
thing Its not a good job Its
not a new car in the driveway Its
something else entirely

NINA
Something spiritual

FITCH
(with a reflexive nod)
The Hopi Indians believe the body of
a person and the earth are formed in
the same way along an axis

Fitch gives up her feet for a moment and glides his hand
upward along her legs until he reaches her spine which he
then gently massages

( )

FITCH
The axis for you and me is our
backbone our spine And along this
axis are various centers of force -

NINA
Centers of force

FITCH

(vo)
Theyre all very important these
different body centers the brain the
throat the solar plexus But the most
important of all is the heart Follow
its sincere purpose the Hopis say and
youre of one heart But if you allow
evil feelings to enter they say you are
of two hearts

CUT TO
ANGLE ON NINA AND FITCH 90

With his hand reaching under her belly resting below her
solar plexus he pauses for a moment

NINA
It all sounds very Eastern

Fitch withdraws his hand and takes a step back

FITCH
Well it is in a way

NINA
Is it

FITCH
The Tibetans and Hindus believed in
an almost identical series of centers
in the body

NINA
(smug)
Its like some shared subconscious
Almost like people are programmed to
invent them

( )

90 90

FITCH
Almost

A beat as he sizes her up wondering if she has even an
inkling as to what hes been saying Then

FITCH
Now to me personally the most
interesting part of this is how
the Hopi medicine man takes these
centers of force and treats someone

CUT TO
91 A DOUBLE BED 91

Fitch lies on his back as the young woman ALICE lays her
hands upon him He listens intently rapt by the words she
speaks the lesson she teaches For if Fitch is a student
of the Hopi culture this may very well be his first
lesson

ALICE
You see he can tell whats wrong
with just his hands He can feel the
vibrations from each center and find
in which one life runs strongest or
weakest

CUT TO
92 THE MASSAGE TABLE 92
as Fitch continues the laying on of hands
FITCH
Sometimes whats wrong is what youd
call illness But other times it
comes from outside drawn by a
persons own evil thoughts or from
those of a Two Heart
CUT TO

ALICE

half across and look through it at
each of the centers

FITCH
And that way he can see the source
of the trouble and the Hopis say
the actual face of the Two Hearts
whos causing it

A beat then Fitch returns his hands to Ninas feet and
resumes massaging them

NINA
(mocking)
Tell me youve got a crystal in that
bag of yours

FITCH
(with an unamused laugh)

NINA
Because I could stand to know which
Two Hearts are causing me my pain

Fitch is visibly annoyed noticeably tired of humoring her
smugness He wanders away from the table

FITCH
It works though you know this kind
of healing What we forget is modern
medicine — any science when you think
about it — is a belief system a
religion like any other religion
Medicine works because we believe it
will work

NINA
Sometimes it just works

FITCH
And lots of times it doesnt

NINA

I like clergymen even less than
doctors

( )

FITCH
Thats because you worship in the
temple of Art Which is a whole lot
like the temple of Science when you
get right down to it Your God is a
jealous God — the most jealous God of
all in fact — the God of Reason

NINA
I see So youre suggesting — what
— I convert Become a Hopi mystic
Can you do that by the way Convert
to another race

FITCH
The point I was making really is
that we have — without even realizing
it — given up one kind of mysticism
for another more socially acceptable
form of mysticism I dont know
about you but Ive never seen a
black hole or a quark They may
exist they may not I personally
have no way of knowing I have seen
Hopis walk away healed though by
nothing more than a medicine man
using his hands and a few crystals

NINA
Christ youre patronizing

FITCH
All Im saying is we — everyone —
weve gone and replaced a system of
belief with a system of disbelief
And that its found its way into
everything we do and think Weve
lost the capacity for wonder And no
one — and this is the insidious part
— no one even knows that its
happened

hard-won beliefs And so

Not as much of a kid as he thinks he
is

So its a risk

He guides her off the table which seems to surprise her

As she looks on curiously he pours oil across the top of
the table and begins working it in like a Japanese steak
chef

FITCH
Complexity

She seems not to understand

FITCH
Just now you said he wouldnt risk
knowing you on a more complex level
So is complexity dangerous

romantic — one

Well Im just not sure there is this
huge difference I havent seen it
anyway

You are trying to get a rise out of

Does it sound it I didnt mean it

Its like that old thing we used to
debate of what drives a man after
sex whether its nature or nurture
that makes him want to run for the
door while the woman will lie there
forever

difference The etiquette of sex

as he continues working on her inner thigh

NINA
But he never owned any of his
inventions his company did So he
never made any money to speak of
And the things he created went inside
other things So no one outside that
company even knew who he was He
just did his thing

FITCH
Maybe he liked it that way Maybe he
didnt want any recognition

NINA
Everybody wants recognition

FITCH

The Hopis have a word pintu It
means I am I

NINA
With my mother it was pretty much
the same thing

CUT TO
NINAS MOTHER 131

Like her father her mother is smiling perfectly happy
perhaps slightly more self-conscious in front of the
CAMERA home movie-style

NINA
(vo)
She had the only acceptable job any
woman had in those days — a nurse
And a good one

CUT TO
THE MASSAGE TABLE — AS BEFORE 132
as Fitch works thoughtfully on her thigh

NINA
But like every other nurse she was
totally ignored stepped on by any
doctor she ever worked with

Another beat then

NINA
It used to break my heart to see it
two people like that as gifted as
they were as caring I swore I
wouldnt live that way

CUT TO
ANDY 133

The scuzzy bohemian palette in hand is rapt at his easel
in the soft amber light of late afternoon a portrait of
the artist as a not-so-young man

NINA
(vo)
Which is what led me to Andy I
guess Andy was on the faculty of
the art department at the college I
was going to

CUT TO

134 ANGLE ON NINA AND FITCH 134

Closing his eyes Fitch continues massaging her inner
thigh searching her by sense of touch only

NINA
And for someone like me — eighteen
small-town girl anonymous — it was
liberation It took about three
years but we did it finally — got
married — my parents werent too
pleased

FITCH
How long were you married

NINA
Good question Lets see Two
three weeks anyway
He smiles believing that shes joking Shes not

FITCH
What happened

NINA
Well as popular as my husband was on-
campus he was revered south of the
border

NINA
I was eighteen nineteen twenty

years old I was a child -

FITCH
- eager for attention

NINA
Andy was charming but the truth is
he wasnt very smart He made one
trip too many through customs

CUT TO
137 A HARSHLY LIGHTED WALL 137
As a UNIFORMED MAN shoves Andy up against it
CUT TO
138 NINA AND FITCH — AS BEFORE 138

NINA
I guess I should be grateful it
wasnt on our honeymoon

A thoughtful beat then

NINA
Yeah I did it for the attention
sure Which cant be said about my
second husband Because I took my
parents advice after that I
settled down with a decent
honorable hard-working young man
It was like taking a four-year nap

A brief beat then

NINA
They were mistakes

FITCH
But you learned from them

NINA
Not really Well maybe I did
decide the only men you should ever
seriously consider marrying are the
ones who already are For the most
part theyve had some experience at
it

FITCH
Lets take a break

As Nina sits Fitcjh prepares his Japanese acupressure
heating pads

FITCH
This is a kind of Japanese
acupuncture that uses heat instead of
needles

He places the pad between her thumb and index finger and
lights it

FITCH
We put it here for nervous tension

A beat as she observes him then

NINA
How about you

FITCH
How about me what

NINA
Married

FITCH
No

NINA
Never

FITCH
No

NINA
Close

FITCH
I suppose Maybe Depends how close
you mean

NINA

A serious relationship A
meaningful relationship Youve
had one of those I would hope

FITCH
I would hope

( )

A CAMPFIRE

NINA
But nothing that stirred up the old
conjugal instinct

FITCH
An instinct is that what it is

NINA
The desire to mate — sure

FITCH
The desire to mate is not the desire
to marry

NINA
No I suppose not

FITCH
No more than standing in a firing
squad is the same as standing in
front of a firing squad

NINA
Right

FITCH
Whats getting married about anyway
Two people swept up in the most out
of control
delusive kind of passion swearing to
God theyll stay that for the rest of
their lives

NINA
Oh so youre a romantic

FITCH
For me what comes out of an
experience isnt nearly so
interesting as the experience itself

He then blows out the pad and

Fitch starts in again massaging her legs

FITCH
People drift apart

NINA
Not always

FITCH
More often than not You get toa
certain point of knowing a person and
you start asking yourself whats
left

NINA
Or maybe you just think youve gotten
to that point

FITCH
Well thats what Ive found At
some time you just realize there are
not going to be any more suprises

NINA
And you like surprises

Fitch smiles ambiguously

NINA
Or is it variety

( )

155

Fitch remains silent

NINA
I dont I dont like surprises
And I dont like variety Variety is
a guy in a leather jock strap whos
just had his nipples pierced And
dont think I havent dated them

A long beat as he slides his hands up to her knee and
begins massaging the lower thigh

CUT TO
NINA AND THE PAINTER 156
Nina in a pose as the painter paints

PAINTER
Im seeing something for the first
time looking at you

NINA
And what are you seeing

PAINTER
An empty room with a locked door

Ninas eyes open wide She is hurt The painter continues
painting as if he hasnt uttered a single word

CUT TO
ANGLE ON THE MASSAGE TABLE 157
as Fitch continues to massage her lower thigh

NINA
I guess I really shouldnt blame
people for what they think of me No
more than I should blame myself So
much of what people do is just
invention anyway inventing
themselves inventing their

friendships -

FITCH
And is that what you did invent
yourself

NINA

Didnt you Poor little rich boy
runs off to join the Indians

( )

157

FITCH
Is that what it seems like

NINA
Its what it is

Fitch quite obviously disagrees with this He nevertheless

resists objecting instead massaging her in pensive
silence

CUT TO
NINAS BEDROOM 158
The painter sits on the edge of the bed as Nina approaches
seductively Then when she is virtually standing over
him

NINA
Am I really an empty room

PAINTER
Yes
She peels off her blouse

Especially now
CUT TO

NINA

Were alike I guess you and me

FITCH
You dont know anything about me

NINA
Dont I

FITCH
Not a thing

NINA

I know that self-indulgence is not
self-fulfillment

( )

159

FITCH
I dont hide behind things at least

NINA
Yes Yes you do In the worst way
of all You hide behind your soul
behind this ooga-booga bullshit

Fitch is stung sufficiently that he stops working Nina
shifts her weight to look up at him

CUT TO
NINAS BEDROOM 160

The painter rises from his position on the bed and walks a
few steps past Nina

PAINTER
In some strange way youre
pretending At liking my work At
being involved with me At wanting
to go to bed with me right now At
everything

NINA
No

PAINTER
I couldnt tell you what it is but
theres just something you cant let
go of

CUT TO
ANGLE ON THE MASSAGE 161
At first Nina seems ready to apologize to Fitch if an
apology is what the situation calls for Instead she says

nothing

A long beat during which he gradually immerses himself in
the massage again

Fitch is now massaging the inside of her thigh working his
way up from the knee to very near her crotch where he
concentrates his strokes

For the first time he seems fully cognizant of what hes doing to
her Clearly shes not in the least uncomfortable with this

FITCH
Is this how Doug does it

( )

NINA
Excuse me

CUT TO

TITLE CARD 10

which reads

The Chest
When massaging the chest of a
woman do not avoid the breasts
Trying to work around the breasts
will disrupt the rhythm of your
strokes

CUT TO

ANGLE ON THE MASSAGE TABLE

Fitch has positioned himself at the head of the table as he

begins a series of broad circular motions just below the

collarbone

FITCH
Maybe the whole things a question of
perception

NINA
What is

FITCH
Its not the way people see you
thats the problem but the way you
see them seeing you

NINA
How do you mean

FITCH
Well like Doug He said you were —
the word he used was
adrift He never mentioned anything
about being single or not being
single He never mentioned anything
at all Beyond the initial
observation that is

NINA
Im not sure I follow

( )

163

His fingers drift nonchalantly lower down her chest
suggesting that he would be the last person to let
something like a breast break the rhythm of his strokes

FITCH
You like things nice things

NINA
I do
FITCH
And you have nice things lots of
them
NINA
A few
FITCH

And yet you feel like a failure

NINA
Did I say that

FITCH
Dont you

With his palms he gently strokes the sides of her breasts
steadfastly refusing to move his hands any closer to her
nipples

CUT TO
NINA AND DOUGLAS 164
as he moves his hands slowly around her breasts encircling
the nipples coming teasingly close to touching them only
to pull away
He repeats this pattern once or twice more until finally
he lets his fingers caress her nipples Her back tenses
He gently pulls at them twisting them slightly as he does
She exhales loudly He pinches them between his thumb and
index finger Her body stiffens

CUT TO
NINA AND FITCH 165
as he brings his hands back to her collarbone never having

touched her nipples directly leaving her visibly
frustrated

( )

NINA
Are you going to hold up your
crystals and tell me Im of Two

Hearts

FITCH
No But you see what I believe is
not ooga-booga bullshit It comes

from first-hand experience There
are people who have possessions lots
of possessions and they are made
miserable by them

NINA
And there are people who live in
refrigerator crates whod trade
places in a second I buy things I
admit it But Im not a materialist
Not really Because to me things
are things They mean nothing

FITCH
Not true They carry memories
Thats the way theyre meaningful —
as a link to other people

NINA
Well all I know is I usually end up
just getting frustrated by all that
conspicuous consumption angry even

FITCH
Because you think whatever it is
youre buying will make you happier
Or younger Or sexier

NINA
I see what youre doing you know
Youre trying to convince me how
miserable I am

FITCH
And am I succeeding

NINA
No just pissing me off

FITCH
Whys that

Because unlike you nothing was ever

NINA (contd)
given to me thats why And its
not money Im talking about not
just Everything I own — everything
I have — Ive earned one way or
another So dont tell me Im wrong
— dont tell me Im immoral — just
because I decided to make something
of my life and you didnt I mean
shouldnt a man your age be
something

FITCH
I know youve made something of your
life Im just asking you what that
is

Nina bolts upright

NINA
No youre not Not anymore

A long beat as they remain eye-to-eye for a moment
then slide herself off the table rising to her feet

NINA
You know what they difference is
between you and me Really The
difference is you have spent so much
time completely rationalizing your
life that you actually believe it
You are a very lonely man Fitch

FITCH
You let him touch you

NINA
Who

as he spider-walks his fingers around her breasts
encircling the nipples

as she backs off slightly
FITCH
Thats what its about isnt it

Doug and you — its about sex

Nina doesnt respond

FITCH
Isnt it
NINA
I dont know
A beat then
NINA
Did he say something to you
Douglas
Fitch shakes his head no
NINA

Oh Christ That obvious hunh
She slouches back toward the massage table

NINA
I know its nothing to him Hes
very discreet about it And its not
like he does anything more than touch
me Its about as safe as sex gets
these days

She now drops herself on the table and sits
NINA
I try to be too discreet We never

talk about it We just pretend its
part of the massage

( )

169

FITCH
Which it is

A brief beat then

NINA
All relationships are a kind of
currency Ive come to the
unfortunate conclusion Im using
you just like youre using me using
you using me On and on it goes
The money part — its at least
honest

A long beat then the TELEPHONE RINGS

Both heads snap in the direction of the phone as it rings
again and again and again until Ninas
answering machine CLICKS ON

NINAS VOICE
(from the answering
machine)
Hi this is Nina At the sound of
the tone the voice you hear will be
your own

We hear the shrill BEEP then

As the answering machine CLICKS OFF Fitch and Nina share
another look She then reclines on the table propping
herself up on one elbow

NINA
This is not the most relaxing massage
Ive ever had

FITCH
But its the best

She half-laughs at this then lowers her shoulder lying
back on the table until she is completely supine

He stands back for a moment as if not quite knowing what
to do next He then reaches for a bottle and spreads oil
thickly across her belly from just below her breasts

He now begins some short deep strokes across her abdomen
careful to avoid even the slightest contact with anything
like an erogenous zone

Sexual contact would in any case be totally extraneous at
this point For in some perceptible though indescribable
way the two are now connected more completely and more
intimately than sex would ever have allowed them to be

NINA

I wasnt being totally honest
FITCH

About what
NINA

Men Men and me As much as I
choose not to believe it the truth
is Ive been involved with a lot of

Two EMTS are in the midst of pulling Alice from the
wreckage They are in no particular hurry to get her up

CUT TO
THE STUDIO 194
Fitch stops for a moment and Nina turns to face him

FITCH

I came to a place once not long ago
It was a lonely place an empty place
with no hope and I thought no way
out Its a place I could have
easily been lost in forever But
slowly I began to understand
something — that I put myself in that
place and that it was up to me to
get myself out And so I chose hope
I chose belief

(physically referring to

his various mystical

items )
You see its all true God has to
be all things to all people To be
anything less would be less than
perfect — human What you believe in
isnt nearly so important as
believing in something But just
dont wait too long or you may find
yourself believing in nothing

FITCH — MOVING 195
through the doorway into the rural house
Once inside he is met by a towering HOPI dressed in
cermonial garb The Hopi extends an arm in the direction
of the center of the room Its there that Fitch sees a
casket with its top open
Fitch leaves the Hopi and crosses reluctantly to the

casket He looks down There lies the perfect lifeless
body of the young woman Alice

melancholy smile Fitch is ashen at the sight of it

I want you to think about not
dropping it and thats all I want
you to think about

NINA
Not dropping it — okay

But on the count of ten the chip is
going to fall from your hand and
youll have absolutely no power to

stop it

NINA
All right
