INT CAVE - NIGHT

The rustic yet comfortable dwelling of a 16-PERSON CLAN All
are dressed in fur and leather their hair long and braided
Small fires burn for warmth and cooking

Women clean up after a meal Men smoke pipes and converse in
a language at once foreign and familiar a blend of Nordic
tongues and English Children chase one another and play with
simple wooden toys

A young BOY intrudes on the adults to tug on the arm of
TERGEHL an elder of the clan

BOY
Come grandfather tell us a story

A weary Tergehl gently declines

BOY (CONT’D)
Please Please tell us a story

Tergehl soon finds himself surrounded by a riot of begging
faces The adults look on with amusement quietly sharing the
children’s eagerness

MAN
Yes Tergehl it has been many
lochnars since we have heard one
(to all)
Shall we hear a story

All chime in vigorously -- “Yes Yes A story

TERGEHL
All right I will tell a story But
then you must all promise to go to
bed

The adults chuckle the children shriek in delight and all
vow to be good

LATER --- The clan have gathered around Tergehl the children
at his feet eyes glimmering

Grasping a gnarled staff Tergehl scratches his chin as if the
story he knows so well were difficult to recall

TERGEHL (CONTD)
Long long ago the world was very
different Giants walked the land
There were so many giants that you
could not count them all even if you
counted for your entire life

(MORE )
TERGEHL (CONTD)
These giants had enormous brains
They could speak to one another
across great distances They taught
themselves to fly and traveled
wherever they wished even to the
moon and the stars Yet despite
these great powers the giants were
not happy They spoke in different
tongues worshipped different gods
and fought bitterly against one
another No matter how much they
ate the giants always wanted more
They killed all the animals chopped
down all the forests fished all the
seas And their fires warmed the
entire world making it unbearably
hot

As Tergehl continues we are transported to --

EXT EDVARDSEN INSTITUTE - DAY
A small tranquil “campus” of buildings

EDVARDSEN INSTITUTE
Bergen Norway

TERGEHL (VO)
But in one of their lands there
lived a clever wizard named Asborgo6n

INT LABORATORY - DAY

DR JORGEN ASBJRNSEN -- fifties balding closely trimmed
beard -- works in his private lab weary and alone

TERGEHL (VO)
Saddened by his greedy fellow giants
Asborg6n wished to change their
harmful ways and end their needless
suffering For years he labored with
his powders and potions until one
day

Dr Asbjrnsen sedates a rat then gives it an injection
before placing it inside a stainless steel device the size of
a microwave

He makes notes flips a switch and watches a timer count
down to zero DING
Long accustomed to failure Dr Asbjrnsen opens the door of
the device with little expectation Today however his eyes
widen in amazement

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Dr Asbjgrnsen sprints down a corridor and into a stairwell

INT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - DAY

Bypassing the secretary Dr Asbjrnsen bursts into the inner
office of institute director DR ANDREAS JACOBSEN

DR JACOBSEN
(Norwegian)
Yes Jorgen

DR ASBJRNSEN
We’ve got it It works

Dr Jacobsen rises from his desk The men embrace

EXT ASBJRNSEN HOUSE - DAY

Electric cars and bicycles are parked outside

EXT ASBJRNSEN BACKYARD - DAY

Thirty-five conscientious SCANDINAVIANS -- natural fibers
beards Birkenstocks -- eat drink and mingle on a crisp
sunny afternoon

INT ASBJRNSEN KITCHEN - DAY

Dr Asbjgrnsen looks out the window at his happy guests
Unlike them he seems troubled and uncertain

Handsome wife ANNE-HELENE approaches to place a comforting
hand on his chest

DR ASBJ®RNSEN
What if it’s a mistake A terrible
mistake

ANNE-HELENE
Don’t be afraid Jorgen You know
it’s the right thing We all do You
were born to make this happen

Dr Asbjrnsen nods slightly Summoning confidence he takes
Anne-Helene’s hand and leads her outside

EXT ASBJRNSEN BACKYARD - DAY

Standing on the deck Dr Asbjggrnsen clinks a knife to a glass
and speaks now in English

DR ASBJRNSEN
Thank you everyone Thank you for
coming today but more importantly I
want to thank you for your dedication
and hard work these past many months

Smiles and applause

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONTD)
Now then You have probably guessed
that I have something very exciting
to announce -- very exciting indeed
(then --)
It is time

A moment of hushed jubilation

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONT’D)
No doubt the generations to come --
perhaps all of humanity -- will thank
you for your bravery and commitment
But today each of you must ask
whether you are truly ready to enter
this new world for there will be no
turning back So I ask you -- are
you ready

THE GROUP
Yes Yes We are ready

PAN around the eager faces of all gathered

INT CAVE - NIGHT
MATCHING PAN of the troglodytes

TERGEHL
So Asborg6n cast a spell over his
brave young warriors and together
they set out to live as none of them
had ever lived before These were
the first of our kind

The children look up at the elders who nod knowingly

The voice belongs to conference president DR PAOLO PEREIRA
who addresses a crowded hall

DR PEREIRA
--and today I’m sure you will agree
they have far exceeded even their
many impressive achievements of the
past It gives me great pleasure to
welcome the director of the institute
and my old friend Dr Andreas
Jacobsen along with his colleague
Dr Jorgen Asbjgrnsen

Al4

Dr Jacobsen emerges carrying a wooden box which he sets atop
the podium

DR JACOBSEN
Thank you Dr Pereira Seventy-five
years ago Mrs Nellie Edvardsen
overcome with guilt by the fortune
her late husband’s family had amassed
producing mustard gas during World
War I founded our institute so that
the wonders of science could instead
be used to help mankind Our mission
is to combat poverty disease
natural disasters and other
calamities that arise over time In
the 1950s the institute identified
over-population as mankind’s single
greatest long-term threat the source
of all the catastrophes we are seeing
today -- extreme climate and weather
events and the devastating impact on
food and water security Among the
many solutions we conceived so many
years ago one which seemed then so
ambitious so outside our grasp has
at last borne fruit Today we are
proud to unveil what we fervently
believe to be the only practical
humane and inclusive remedy to
humanity’s gravest problem Dr
Jorgen Asbjrnsen will now present
his findings Are you ready doctor

DR ASBJRNSEN (0S)
(muffled distant)
I am ready

Jacobsen opens the front of the box to reveal --
DR ASBJ®RNSEN NOW JUST FIVE INCHES TALL

As this miniature human walks out onto the podium gasps of
astonishment ripple throughout the room Many stand to get a
better look

DR JACOBSEN
Everyone please take your seats
Please

As the audience quiets Dr Asbjgrnsen takes his place behind
a tiny podium dons reading glasses and removes a speech from
his jacket pocket
DR ASBJRNSEN
Dr Pereira esteemed colleagues
Five years ago building on the
research of our predecessors at the
institute my team and I discovered a
process by which all organic material
can be reduced at the cellular level
by a ratio of approximately 2744 to
one Such a process converts a man
of 18 meters to just 129
centimeters A wide array of flora
and fauna were subjected to this
process and with the exception of
some fish and shellfish absolutely
no side effects were detected
Please lights

The room dims A GROUP PORTRAIT of the gathering at the
Asbjrnsen home appears on a screen above the stage -- the
first image in a PowerPoint presentation

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONTD)
Once the safety of the procedure was
confirmed thirty-six brave
volunteers joined my wife Anne-Helene
and me as the very first humans to
undergo cellular reduction

A NAKED SUBJECT poses before reduction arms extended like Da
Vinci’s Vitruvian man Next he shows off his new TINY BODY
beside a metric a ruler held by enormous fingers

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONTD)
The exact science behind reduction
itself falls outside of our
discussion today but the process is
short and painless with only the
mild discomfort of removal and
replacement of dental and other
prosthetics

Now we see a RECOVERY ROOM where wrapped in blankets
volunteers recline on miniature Le Corbusier lounges One
tiny man drinks from an enormous eye-dropper

DR ASBUJRNSEN (CONTD)
Subjects are placed under light
sedation and after a brief rest
perhaps some crackers and applesdft
fully recover within an hour or two

Now a normal-sized SHORT-HAIRED DOG on a leash The next
slide shows the same dog standing next to the ruler while a
GIANT HAND restrains him with a tiny leash

DR ASBJRNSEN
Of course some of our community
could not bear to leave behind their
four-legged companions

Now shots inside a WORKSHOP Volunteers construct small
houses and buildings Others sew tiny clothes

DR ASBJRNSEN
As the subjects of our own study our
aim was not only to confirm the long-
term viability of the process but
also to investigate the social and
psychological implications Thus we
set about to live together in the
world’s very first self-sustaining
community of the small

The next images show the building of a small VILLAGE Group
members secure dollhouse-size dwellings onto foundations Then
we see the hoisting of a TRANSPARENT DOME over the new
community

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONTD)
Once complete our little village
just seven meters by eleven meters
was placed inside a gas-permeable
enclosure designed to protect us from
the hazards of weather animals and
insects

INT CONFERENCE CENTER - DAY

Learning of the exciting news other CONFERENCE-GOERS clamor
to gain access to the auditorium

INT AUDITORIUM - DAY

As Dr Asbjrnsen concludes his talk a FINAL SLIDE shows the
downsized group playing volleyball

DR ASBJRNSEN
--and finally my colleagues and
I are happy to report new founts
of energy and vitality Future
studies may support our suspicion
that decreased mass and volume
correlate directly to an increase
in longevity

As the lights come up a beaming Dr Jacobsen strides from the
wings holding aloft a half-full GARBAGE BAG

DR JACOBSEN

I hold in my hand all of the

uncompostable waste produced by 36

people over four years

(holding for applause)

In this afternoon’s session we will

outline our proposal for a two- to

three-hundred year transition for the

world to transform from big to small

We believe that with a timely embrace

of miniaturization our seemingly

unconquerable problems of over-

population climate change and

insufficient food and water can

become a thing of the past and human

life may safely thrive for millennia

to come

(motioning off-stage)

Now we’d like you to meet some very

special people
As the piéce de résistance a cart is wheeled out carrying the
ENTIRE SMALL COMMUNITY smiling and waving Among them a
MOTHER nurses an infant while at her side stands her four-
year-old son RONNI

DR ASBJRNSEN

And look -- there’s little Ronni the

first small baby ever born and his

new little sister Ulrikke

All stand applaud and stamp their feet in unison -- an
astounding reception

his search for love and the quest to
fulfill his destiny

KAY
Bullshit

Kay focuses on eating and watching TV

PAUL
(smelling)
Did you have a cigarette

KAY

INT PAUL’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 29

Paul watches TV in a recliner of his own The phone rings
and the machine picks up It’s Paul’s on-again-off-again
girlfriend AUDREY

AUDREY (ON MACHINE)

Paul it’s Audrey I know we’re not
supposed to be talking but I thought
you should know I had to put Bodie
down today His seizures came back a
couple months ago and I could have
had him operated on but they cut
back my hours at work and he was
getting really old and

Look I’m worried about global
warming as much as the next fellow
but let’s not throw the baby out with
the bath water

INT LA CASA RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The TV over the bar shows a Fox News-style debate

TALKING HEAD 1
This whole downsizing thing is
another example of runaway-train
technology leading us down a blind
alley With all the holier-than-
thou talk about saving the planet
we can’t ignore the devastating
economic impact that’ll lead to
more poverty which’1ll lead to more
downsizing and then more poverty
and the whole world economy going
right down the toilet Billions of
dollars in consumer spending are
already starting to vanish --
construction and housing the
automobile industry the airline
industry defense

(MORE )

It’s

TALKING HEAD 1 (CONTD)
And then all the political abuses --
Israelis shrinking Palestinians
African dictators shrinking rival
ethnic groups --

As the opposing speaker interrupts we realize he’s SMALL

TALKING HEAD 2
Look Ron Ron In any major
transformation of society are there
serious growing pains You bet But
we have to focus on the long term
The fact is that at current mass and
volume human life on Earth just
isn’t sustainable and dealing with
that head-on makes good economic
sense no matter how you cut it

We find a balder paunchier Paul seated in a booth enjoying
happy hour with buddies KEVIN and TIM

KEVIN
The one guy’s got a point This
family on my block just moved away to
get small and their house is just
sitting there Making everybody’s
value take a dive is what they’re
doing Just when I’m trying to
refinance

EXT MCMANSION FOR SALE - DAY 38

He pauses at the door turning to look back at Audrey -- all
she does to complete him all she does to diminish him

INT DUPLEX BASEMENT - NIGHT 41

In boxers and T-shirt Paul sits at a desk going through a

I have small hands which they say
is a real plus Hey we might have
wound up working together You
could’ve been my anesthesiologist

ANESTHESIOLOGIST
Hey how about that

PAUL
Yeah Wild

LATER -- Dinner has not yet begun There’s still a fair 44
amount of mingling but many are finding their chairs

Seated at his table Paul takes a moment to look around and
his eyes fall upon felt banners with inspirational sayings --
“The door to happiness opens outward” and “The best way to
find yourself is to lose yourself in service to others”

NEAR THE ENTRANCE a flurry of excitement suggests someone
special has arrived It’s just a GUY in his mid-20s but
judging from reactions -- gasps pointing -- it’s the
ACRYLIC BOX he carries that’s causing the commotion

The guy passes Paul and Audrey’s table and like everyone
else they gawk at what’s inside the box --

A TINY COUPLE smiling and waving at old friends

PAUL (CONTD)
That’s Dave Dave Johnson And
Carol I heard he was coming but I
had no idea Man I never would
have pegged him for someone whod go
get small Did you see that

AT A TABLE
The guy carrying the box -- Dave Johnson’s younger brother
ANDY -- sets it down and removes the top and front

Paul and Audrey join the onlookers many of whom are taking
photos with their phones

Dave and Carol walk out onto the table and speak through
little hand-held MEGAPHONES

DAVE
Hey everybody Hope we’re not
intruding

Warm greetings all around Dave places two tiny glasses where
his brother can retrieve them

DAVE (CONTD)
Andy could you get Carol a
Honey what’re you having

CAROL
Gin and tonic

DAVE
A gin and tonic and for me You
know what That sounds good I’11
have a gin and tonic too

Andy slides the impossibly small tumblers onto his palm and
heads toward the bar

DAVE (CONT’D)
With lime

ANDY
How am I supposed to do that

DAVE
Just figure it out okay

As many migrate toward the new arrivals a JESUIT turns on a
mic at the podium

JESUIT
Don’t mean to break up the party but
the silent auction closes in fifteen
minutes and there are still some
very attractive items with no takers

EXT FRIENDS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

A nice middle-class home

INT FRIENDS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

At this informal after-party for an extended group of old
friends the camera makes its way through the living room
where little Carol Johnson holds court standing on a coffee
table Friends lean in to hear better

CAROL
We weren’t going to come at first
but then we started getting all the e-
mails plus my sister was having a
lump removed She’s fine thank God
but I still needed to see her

SOME FRIEND
So what’s traveling like How’d you
get up here from New Mexico

CAROL
Oh we flew Airlines are getting
more and more small-friendly
(MORE )

CAROL (CONTD)
They make it really easy and all the
seats are first class

We continue on to --
THE KITCHEN

-- where Paul is amid a heart-to-heart with Dave
a box of Ak-Mak Crackers

DAVE
So after a couple years in Florida I
moved out to Vegas and --

PAUL
I remember I think that’s about the
last time we talked

DAVE
Yeah Vegas wasn’t such a good
choice for me as it turns out Got
into some real bad habits Pretty
much hit rock bottom

PAUL
Sorry to hear that

DAVE
Any other woman would have run for
the hills but Carol man she’s a
saint She stuck with me But I
really had to come clean about
everything And I mean everything
You know almost

PAUL
And the decision to
(makes a shrinking motion)

DAVE
Well that’s the thing We both
needed a change You know start all
over

PAUL
It must feel good knowing you’re
making a real difference too

DAVE
You mean all that crap about saving
the planet Downsizing is about
saving yourself Takes the pressure
right off especially money pressure

seated atop

DAVE (CONTD)
I’m just not you know driven and
ambitious like the rest of my family
It’s not who I am Now Carol and I
we live like kings -- a hell of a lot
better than my brothers and my
sister I’ll tell you that I send
them pictures all the time but they
never respond

PAUL
Well I’m still living in the same
house I grew up in Audrey’s dying
for us to move but we’re pretty
strapped Plus my mom’s end-of-life
care really took a toll I mean
shit I just finished paying off my
student loans

DAVE
Well listen if you ever start
thinking about it seriously here’s
my two cents There are lots of
small communities cropping up out
there but don’t mess around
Leisureland’s where you want to be
They are a little pricier but they
were the first and they’re still
way ahead of the curve

PAUL
They’ve sure got a big marketing
budget

DAVE

Lots to brag about Best houses
best appliances best doctors they
book all the big concert tours got
all the great restaurants The kids
love Cheesecake Factory and
Leisureland’s got three of them And
I’m not just saying all this for the
referral credit

(off Paul’s laugh)
Hey sorry could you back up a
little I think there’s too much
garlic in that salsa

PAUL
Oh right

DAVE
Or floss or something I don’t
know

Suddenly a child’s SCREAM Alarmed Paul heads into the
living room where he finds the HOSTS comforting their four-
year-old DAUGHTER who has wandered downstairs and is scared
out of her wits by the sight of little Carol

Hi guys Milo here from Goodman
Mortgage

VOICEMAIL (CONTD)
Hate to say it but your application
at First National bounced back The
underwriter didn’t like the
adjustments in the appraisal Like I
said the market for a hundred-year-
old duplex with structural issues is
pretty soft and there are red flags
from an underwriter’s perspective I
can try somewhere else but frankly I
think you’re going to need more cash
up front if we want to get approved
on the type of property you’re
looking at

Paul and Audrey share a weighty defeated look

INT SMALL PLANE - DAY

In the copilots seat Tony turns around and speaks as though
we’re in the back

TONY DALE
The first order of business was to
find the perfect location -- not too

cold in the winter not too hot in

tornados no hurricanes And no
pesky mosquitoes Yep everything
had to be just right

TONY DALE (VO)
Each dwelling would be a dream house
a genuine estate within anyone’s
reach Mass transit would be free
and efficient The streets would be
neat and orderly offering easy
access to shops schools parks
medical services and of course all
the recreation and entertainment you
can imagine

returning us to --

INT LEISURELAND THEATER - DAY

Stage lights illuminate theme music begins and a platform
thrusts past the rising screen On the platform sits a
downsized MANSION with swimming pool and tennis court

Tanned sales professional JEFF LONOWSKI steps out of the front
door wearing a headset mic trailed by a tiny CAMERAMAN who
transmits Jeffs image onto a large screen

JEFF

Thanks Mr Dale Welcome
everybody I’m Jeff Lonowski Senior
Product Specialist and happy
homeowner here at Leisureland
Estates Are you having a good time

(off initial response)
Come on guys You’re a heck of a
lot bigger than I am Make some
noise Are you having a good time

Paul and Audrey join the enthusiastic response “Yes”

JEFF (CONT’D)

That’s more like it So what do you
think of my place Pretty nifty
huh It’s the house of my dreams
Heck I’d say it’s the house of
anybody’s dreams Why an average
guy like me might have to work
twenty thirty even forty years to
be able to afford a spread like this
And just wait until you see what’s
inside

The house splits open to reveal the massive family room
enormous bedrooms airy kitchen In the master suite
upstairs and with a CAMERA GUY all her own Jeffs “wife”
LAURA sits in a bubble bath

LAURA
(headset mic)
Jeff you’ve got to stop inviting
guests over without telling me

JEFF
Sorry Laura I was only --

LAURA
I mean I finally got in the tub to
relax after such a busy day

JEFF
Busy doing what sweetheart

LAURA
Oh no end of things First I took a
tennis lesson and had a massage
Then after a gourmet lunch with the
girls we just couldn’t help
ourselves and popped into that new
Loget’s store downtown

JEFF
Uh-oh Loget’s What’s that going to
cost me

LAURA

Now Jeff you hush I was really
good Just a diamond bracelet

The cameraman zooms in for a close-up of the sparkling
jewelry eliciting admiring “oohs” from audience members

JEFF
Just a diamond bracelet That
doesn’t sound like you

LAURA
(pulling her hair back)
And matching diamond earrings And
the matching diamond necklace
(as Jeff crosses his arms)
Oh Jeff they look so good on me
Wait till you --

JEFF
How much Laura

LAURA
Now Jeff --

JEFF
I said how much

LAURA
(sheepish)
Sixty-two dollars

JEFF
Sixty-two dollars Are you crazy
Why that’s practically our food
budget for two whole months

INT VIEWING CORRIDOR - DAY 62
The exit doors of the theater snap open

Along with the rest of the audience Paul and Audrey step onto
a wide walkway Floor-to-ceiling windows offer a first
glimpse at the actual city of Leisureland

The initial impression is both impressive and banal It’s
partially like a miniature theme park and partially like any
other mid-sized city

But a couple of unusual features stand out One is a giant
FERRIS WHEEL Another is the CENTRAL TOWER which functions
both as a “tent pole” for the overhead netting and as the
transfer station for an innovative and fanciful mass transit

system -- GONDOLAS traveling on cables above the city

MOMENTS LATER -- Paul and Audrey peruse model homes ranging 63
from one-story ranches through three-story McMansions -- “The
Regency” “The Barrington” “The Aristocrat” “The
Mediterranean” “The Sportsman”

At the top end like a sumptuous Bel-Air estate is “The
Versailles” boasting a sticker price of 129999

INT SALES AREA - DAY 64

A tracking shot through an ocean of sales desks ends on Paul
and Audrey where a chipper SALESPERSON walks them through a
print-out of their finances

SALESPERSON
So putting it all together if you
liquidate your current home vehicles
and other assets and purchase a
Regency-level estate -- that’s a
12000-square-foot-equivalent home on
a 15-acre-equivalent lot -- at the
base price of 63000 Plus 4500
for the Health and Fitness package
That’s the gym pool saunasteam
hot tub and tennis court Then the
medical procedure for two adults
That’s 15000
PAUL
Does insurance cover any of that

SALESPERSON
No but at Regency level youre
already qualifying for a substantial
discount And don’t forget the federal
tax credit So figuring in your
current debt your retirement accounts
and your savings you’re looking at
approximately 152000 in equity which
is a very comfortable number

AUDREY
Comfortable That doesn’t sound like
nearly enough

SALESPERSON
You have to look at this column
Audrey Equivalent value You’re
solidly inside the Blue Chip zone
In Leisureland your 152000
translates into around 125 million -
- to live on for life

AUDREY
Hold on If this is such a great
thing how come you haven’t done it

SALESPERSON
I would in a heartbeat but my
husband had a hip replacement so
he’s ineligible But look around
you If you come back in a month
you won’t see most of my co-workers
still here People take jobs just
for the discount Did you see Jeffs
little show upstairs -- the house
that opens up He used to sit right
over there Of course he doesn’t
have to work anymore but he’s a real
ham -- just loves the attention
Anyway how’s all this sounding
Would the Regency be your first
choice Or should we be looking at
something a little more deluxe

Audrey looks at Paul
PAUL
Honey pick anything you like I
just want you to be happy

She beams

AUDREY
I mean sure I was on the fence
about it for most of the year It’s

pretty scary when you think about it
at first But then when my college
roommate Patty Loomis called to say
she and her husband were doing it
and all the reasons why I turned to
Paul and said okay you win Let’s
go for it

GINA
(hugging her)
I’m just going to miss you so much

AUDREY
Oh Gina I’m going to miss you too
But you know it’s not like we’re
dying We’re just relocating and
changing things up a bit We’ll be
back at least once a year And you
and Tim can come down and stay with
us anytime We have like five guest
rooms Open invitation Stay as
long as you like

Gina laughs through tears at this joke
LATER -- BARRY talks with Paul and Audrey

BARRY
And you guys didn’t consider Treasure
Island out in Palm Desert

PAUL

Yeah we checked it out but

(looking at Audrey)
I mean I liked it all right but
Audrey thought they were a little
stingy with the amenities especially
for what they charge in monthly
maintenance

AUDREY
And too hot And really provincial --
everything is golf golf golf And
almost no diversity Super white
bread

PAUL
Yeah no diversity

72 LATER -- Audrey’s father LARRY LUSTIG walks in Audrey greets 72

you the truth I was pretty skeptical
myself at first You remember Jerry
Gross Well I called him up the
other day He and Bev retired down
there did the whole shrinking thing
you kids are doing He says they’re
getting along just fine never
better Says he feels younger every
day says one dollar buys a thousand
dollars worth of stuff

medication Bev takes But yeah they
play nine holes every morning Even
taking a two-week cruise up to Alaska
next month First class stateroom
gourmet food whole nine yards Says
the whole thing’s costing around 150
No I see the appeal And apparently
there’s zero crime That’s what I
keep telling your mother

73 LATER -- The party has wound down and Paul and Audrey enjoy
a final nightcap with close friends including Tim a friend
of Paul’s we’ve met before A DRUNK GUY wanders over

DRUNK GUY
Hey you guys are getting small
right

PAUL

That’s right My wife and I

DRUNK GUY
My friend over there has a question
No offense but do you think if
you’re that small you should still
have all the same rights as the rest
of us Same right to vote

PAUL
Why wouldn’t we

DRUNK GUY
Well let’s see You’re not buying
as many products you’re not paying
as much income tax not really
participating in our economy In
fact you’re costing us money And
jobs

TIM
Hey hey That’s enough We’re all
just having a good time here

DRUNK GUY

question If anything a quarter-
vote At most

What about helping me You’re so
goddamned stubborn You did this

Hey hey hey that’s completely
unfair You’re the one who’s never
satisfied with anything You’re the
one who says I spend too much time at
work You’re the one who wants to
live in a palace
You’re the one who says we can’t have

Snazzy

Well sir here’s the key to your

They stock the kitchen with some
standard items but one thing I should
warn you about is the dairy -- it takes
a while for your stomach to adjust to
milk and cheese so go easy Something
about the bacteria And careful with
the hot water It’s all on one central
system and they keep it cranked up
pretty high I’m surprised they
haven’t had a lawsuit yet

Thanks Matt You’re a nice guy

Paul gets out and trudges toward his new house

An ANCHOR speaks to camera while behind himher a GRAPHIC

question mark rising out of it

NEWS ANCHOR

For years both the Department of
Homeland Security and the INS have
been warning about the ease with
which downsized persons -- from
illegal immigrants to potential
terrorists -- could penetrate US
borders Last week’s discovery in
Eugene Oregon provided tragic new
evidence to support that claim

BRIAN FAKLER
This Costco is just one of thousands
of big-box stores around the country
that import almost a million tons of
goods weekly most of it from Asia
Last week workers here in Eugene
opened a suspicious TV box and
discovered seventeen downsized
stowaways from Vietnam fourteen of
them already dead two more dying
hours later at a local hospital

On Friday the lone survivor a 45-
year-old woman named Ngoc Lan Tran
was transferred to a hospital at
Leisureland Estates in New Mexico

medical center for the small

BRIAN FAKLER (VO)
Yesterday US officials were able

time According to a statement from
the Department of Homeland Security
Ms Tran claims to have been jailed
for her environmental and political
activism and along with dozens of
other dissidents was miniaturized
against her will in a Vietnamese
prison facility If true this would
bolster accusations by human rights
groups that repressive governments
around the world are forcibly
downsizing scores of prisoners and
political undesirables

Can you imagine wishing to remain
among the giants With all of their
fighting and all of their hunger
Trampling the ground with their huge
feet

To the children’s squeals of delight Tergehl mocks how a

despise their smaller brethren They
already hated one another Why would
they not hate us even more

pale I hate her I barely know
her and you may not hate her but
I hate her You just have to get

You didn’t have to do that

She spots a huge yellow ROSE in a vase

Wow is that a real flower Where’d
you get that

PAUL
Full-Sized Flower Mart Just opened

Paul and Kristen enjoy dinner

KRISTEN
Paul this is so good

PAUL
Thanks The recipe called for
chervil but you can’t get chervil
here yet I used dill

KRISTEN
Well whatever it is it’s super-
yummy

PAUL

It’s the little things I mean
except for no birds and insects
you’d almost think we’re in the
normal world Then something
happens and you realize we’re not
Not that substituting dill for
chervil’s a big thing but you
know

They smile and shake their heads Life sure is strange

KRISTEN
Like last month when my parents came
down to visit Jonah and me --

PAUL
Uh-huh

KRISTEN
-- and it’s like this whole
production with the carrying boxes
and Jonah gets freaked out by
Grandma and Grandpa being so huge
and scary One night they took us
for dinner at Fleming’s you know
real nice and of course Jonah and
I are sitting on the table in those
special seats and the big people
wouldn’t stop staring at us

(MORE )

KRISTEN (CONTD)
Plus the restaurant brags about
how small people are welcome but
then they charge a huge minimum

PAUL
They should be charging big people
extra They’re the ones dragging the
world down

KRISTEN
I know Big people look at us like
were the freaks They’re the
freaks I mean sure I brought
Jonah here mostly for the schools
but I also know I’m at least trying
to do something good Oh did you
hear about all that gas being
released in Antarctica From the
ice

PAUL
Haven’t really been following the
news much lately

KRISTEN
Yeah apparently it’s a big deal A
lot of scientists are saying we’re
already way beyond --

through the ceiling followed by raucous LAUGHTER Paul
offers an apologetic grimace

don’t hear a peep -- I guess he
wasn’t even here -- then suddenly

DUSAN
Paul You came And you bring the
rose

PAUL

Peace offering

DUSAN
Look everybody This is Paul my
neighbor Look at what he brings me -
- a real rose A real fucking rose

(to Paul)

Do you think any of these other
ungrateful sons of bitches think to
bring something to Dusan Only you
I like you What about your blonde
American friend

Paul shakes his head Dusan nods in approval

DUSAN (CONTD)

Why bring sand to the beach

(escorting Paul)
Look I know I said it was going to
be a small party but it’s not my
fault I make two or three phone
calls to close friends and look what
happens Everyone comes Nothing
else to do in this fucking city after
10 o’clock This I do not
understand It’s not as if so many
people have work in the morning Is
the worst trait of small people --
they are lazy Not all but most
Like this lazy guy Konrad

KONRAD is an older German in nautical attire -- turtleneck
double-breasted blazer -- helping himself to a splendid buffet
of both normal-sized and small gourmet foods

KONRAD
What’s that you say about me What
lies are you telling

DUSAN
Just that in the small world no one
wants to work

KONRAD
What did you expect That is the
wonderful thing about becoming small
You are immediately rich Unless you
are very poor Then you are only
small
A135

PAUL
Actually I wouldn’t call myself
poor but I have a job --

DUSAN

than ten meters from his boat

Locking arms with Paul and speaking with sudden intimacy
Konrad leads him onto --

Konrad points out a YACHT in the marina below

KONRAD
There she is -- Sonja my beauty An
exact replica of an English yacht
from 1927 You see I am from many
generations all the way to my
grandfathers and my father — all sea
captains I remember very well I was
seven years old when my grandfather
took me for the first time on his
boat I will never forget the
rocking of the waves the sound of
the wind the blackness of the water
From that moment I knew I would be a
sea captain too

PAUL
What brings you to Leisureland

KONRAD
Dusan He even convinced me to become
small mostly for the women and the
parties And frankly my wife had
all the money so after she left
things became let’s say tricky

PAUL
I can relate

KONRAD
It’s really quite wonderful to be
small don’t you think

PAUL
I’d say it has its pluses and
minuses

A135

KONRAD
I am here in your city about once a
year always with Dusan Next week I
will be in the Seychelles and two
weeks after that I’1l meet friends for
a month of sailing on Lake Titicaca
Can you believe I’ve never been to
Lake Titicaca

than I do

meet at a jam-band concert Paul returns her enigmatic smile
She hugs him and whispers in his ear

PAUL

The woman begins dancing Paul gamely joins in

PAUL (CONTD)

She removes a pill from a tiny case and offers it to him

PAUL (CONTD)

She wiggles her eyebrows suggestively

PAUL (CONTD)
I need to know what it is
Allergies

She places the pill on her extended tongue sweetening the
offer Paul demurs She shrugs and turns away

the pill deeply into his mouth He assumes there’s more fun
in store but she just nods approvingly strokes his cheek and
dances away

Good morning Mr Dusan We come

Paul watches the legs of a small cleaning crew enter his
interest piqued by one person’s crude PROSTHETIC FOOT

141 INT DUSAN’S KITCHEN - DAY
Paul shuffles in to find Dusan rooting around

DUSAN
Fucking hyenas ate everything I am
surprised there is even still water
when I turn on the sink

Paul sits on a stool and Dusan pours him coffee From the
next room comes the sound of vacuuming

DUSAN (CONTD)
So you had fun last night yes You
did not know you were so lucky to
have exciting neighbor such as me

PAUL
Never been to a party like that So
many Europeans Did you know Little

Ronni was here I mean he’s
historic

DUSAN
And boring Good looking dumb
Norwegian guy goes around the world
having sex with everybody -- women
men hermaphrodites dogs goats
monkeys He’1ll be the first small
baby to die of syphilis But yes
okay historic

Glancing into the next room Paul notices that the one-legged
woman is the one steering the vacuum cleaner

PAUL
Apparently he still lives in the
original colony you know over in
Norway I’ve always wanted to see
that

DUSAN
It’s all right

PAUL
You’ve been there

DUSAN
I go once or twice a year
Konrad too We make business there
Good business

PAUL
Man that really must be something to
see You can’t even find pictures of
it online

Dusan studies Paul

DUSAN
Yes my friend The world is filled
with things to see I don’t know
you Paul but I like you I like
you very much And my advice is to
get out of your disgusting little
fucking apartment and open your eyes
Don’t be so American Why you even
are small if you live like that like
a rat in a cage And that ugly
woman

PAUL
Kristen She’s not ugly

DUSAN
Only your furniture is more ugly
You are nice guy Paul but little
bit pathetic guy You need help --
you know how to think about life
Last night you dance and you laugh
but inside you cry

PAUL
Hey who are you to talk to me like
that

DUSAN

I am your neighbor Dusan Mirkovic
And neighbors are friends And
friends tell friends the truth

Okay maybe sometimes I’m a little
bit asshole but the world needs
assholes Otherwise where would shit
come out

INT DUSAN’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Paul sits with Dusan on the sofa Dusan smokes a cigar At
some point Konrad wanders by on his way to get coffee

DUSAN
When I see big people becoming small
all the new small cities I see
opportunity I ask myself Dusan
why the people they become small To
help the environment Please They
become small to have the things which
until now were only for the rich
which by the way is the genius of
the concept So I say to my brother

Srdjan -- I work with my brother
He’s still big
(low)

My wife too by the way

PAUL
(also low)
Your wife How does that work

Dusan gives a quick furtive “thumbs-up” sign accompanied by a
satisfied nod

DUSAN
So I say why not bring very special
items luxury items to the small
consumer The things no one else is
thinking to bring

PAUL
Such as

Dusan holds up his cigar

DUSAN

Cohiba Espléndido Cuba The best
cigar in the world How much you pay
for this when you are big

(Paul shrugs)
Forty-five fifty dollars But when
you are small I will sell you this
cigar for one dollar

PAUL
Still seems like a lot I mean a
pack of cigarettes is what twenty
cents most of it tax

DUSAN
Not if you remember paying fifty
dollars for the same cigar If now

you pay only one dollar you say I
am so happy to be small And from
one Cohiba we make more than 2000
cigars Okay maybe the cigars are
not actually made in Cuba Maybe
they are rolled by little Albanians
in Podgorica but who cares And
this is just the one thing Also
perfumes and colognes wines Bordeaux
and Burgundy brandies and Port and
Calvados caviar jamdon ibérico
truffles My brother and I are now
in seven small cities All around
the world Seven

PAUL
Is all that legal

DUSAN
Baby this is Wild West time Who
has time to chase after some fucking
Serbian guy five inches tall over a
few cigars and some wine And

Again Paul notices with concern the one-legged cleaning woman
as she hobbles upstairs on her way to another room

PAUL
(rising)
Excuse me a minute

INT DUSAN’S BATHROOM - DAY 143

Paul appears in the doorway and finds the woman rummaging
through Dusan’s medicine cabinet and putting some items into
her smock

PAUL
Hello

She spins around startled We may recognize her from the
news report -- Vietnamese dissident NGOC LAN TRAN Her
green cap reads “Jade Palace Cleansing Service”

PAUL (CONTD)

NGOC LAN

clean take away for you
(holding out a bottle)
Na-pro-shien What this do

PAUL
Naproxen That’s an anti-
inflammatory

(off her blank stare)
It helps with pain and swelling

She pockets the bottle and picks up another

NGOC LAN

And this one what this one do
PAUL

pain killer but it’s well you want
to be careful with that one

NGOC LAN
(pocketing it)

PAUL

of pain but I don’t think you

NGOC LAN

(closing the cabinet)
Okay I finish now Bathroom clean

She pushes past Paul and he follows her into --

A144 INT DUSAN’S SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS A144

PAUL

“friend” I see you have a really

Dusan and Konrad share a big laugh

144 INT DUSAN’S DINING ROOM - DAY 144

Ngoc Lan sits in a chair while Paul cups a kneecap and
manipulates the foreleg then repeats the process with the
other leg Dusan and Konrad watch as do from afar the rest
of the cleaning crew

Ngoc Lan submits to the exam but seems more interested in Paul
himself than in what he’s saying

PAUL
Okay I’m going to push down and you
try to push up Mm-hm You’ve got
some pretty severe asymmetrical
muscle compensation

DUSAN
Paul you are full of surprises You
can do this but you work shit job
answering phones

PAUL
When I moved here I didn’t think I’d
be working so I let my license
expire And to get a license now in
a different state it’s a boring
story

NGOC LAN
(to the other cleaners)
Hey you no look me You work now
Trabajo Trabajo

As they scatter Paul places Ngoc Lans hand on her own knee
and moves her foreleg up and down

PAUL

You feel that crunching That’s
arthritis It’s already pretty
bad

(releasing it)
I hate to say it but if you don’t
take care of it pretty soon you’re
going to need a new knee And that’s
just for starters Maybe a new hip
too You should see a specialist as
soon as you can and get a whole new
foot

Ngoc Lan says nothing Does she understand

PAUL (CONTD)
In the meantime I could make a few
adjustments to your existing
prosthetic and give you some pointers
on how to walk better I hate to see
you suffer needlessly after all
you’ve been through

NGOC LAN
Okay I finish work you come with me

PAUL

NGOC LAN
Clinic no good I take her clinic

Paul looks to Dusan for help but Dusan just shrugs

INT GONDOLA - DAY

Paul now cleaned up rides with Ngoc Lan in a crowded car
The other PASSENGERS many in work uniforms are mostly
Latino

EXT GONDOLA STATION - DAY

Ngoc Lan and Paul exit the station amid a flow of humanity

PAUL
You live near here
NGOC LAN
Still far
PAUL

Maybe we should grab a car

NGOC LAN
No car This way

Ngoc Lan limps past him pointing toward a shuttle stop where
three BUSES are taking on passengers

EXT FAR SIDE OF LEISURELAND - DAY

The bus drives away from central Leisureland and enters a very
modest section of town -- smallish houses LATINO CHILDREN
playing in the streets

INT BUS - DAY

Ngoc Lan and Paul have found a seat but the aisle is packed
Buoyant RANCHERA MUSIC on the speakers contrasts with the
weary faces of the passengers

PAUL
If you don’t mind my asking you

Everybody was talking about you I
would’ve thought you’d be writing
books and making speeches I mean
how’d you wind up cleaning houses

NGOC LAN

PAUL
But after all you’ve been through I

(MORE )

NGOC LAN (CONTD)
Female dog okay Vietnamese but
female dog English very bad name

Paul nods politely at the outburst Glancing outside he
notes that the bus is now passing through --

EXT NO MAN’S LAND - DAY

An area of undeveloped lots and fields

One entire square block has been removed the resulting hole
surrounded by safety barriers NORMAL-SIZED MEN in hard hats
work down below only their heads visible above ground

INT BUS - DAY

Paul now cranes his neck to look through the front windshield

and discovers that the bus is headed directly toward THE WALL
encircling Leisureland

EXT FAR SIDE OF LEISURELAND - DAY

The bus disappears into the wall’s shadow and heads toward a
TUNNEL in the wall Graffiti around the entrance has made it
look like the pupil of a giant eye

INT BUS - DAY

The bus motors through the darkness of the tunnel finally
emerging into the light

EXT WORKERS’ CITY - DAY
The bus comes to a stop and Paul follows Ngoc Lan off

This is essentially a BORDER TOWN Here the protective
overhead netting hangs much lower and is poorly maintained --
Paul notices the sagging weight of a BIRD CARCASS

As Ngoc Lan leads him he continues to take in a world he had
no idea existed Most imposing is the sight of --

NORMAL-SIZED TRAILERS

of the sort used for portable classrooms or construction
offices Here they’ve been re-purposed into apartment
buildings with rows of tiny windows and crisscrossed bootleg
wiring

Ngoc Lan leads Paul up the entrance ramp to one particular
trailer named ALONDRA dodging Spanish-speaking CHILDREN
tobogganing past on normal-size bottle caps

INT ALONDRA APARTMENTS - DAY

Stepping inside Paul pauses to absorb the extraordinary
interior view Like inside an Embassy Suites or a high-
security prison walkways on every floor surround an ATRIUM

On the ground floor RESIDENTS watch a 26” television which
in this context rises three stories tall The sound of a
garish Spanish-language program echoes throughout

Ngoc Lan heads toward a staircase and begins to climb her
speed impressive

PAUL
(catching up)
Can I ask how high we’re going

NGOC LAN
Seven floor

PAUL
Isn’t there an elevator

NGOC LAN
Elevator broken You walk with me

INT ALONDRA SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY
Paul arrives out of breath but Ngoc Lan seems fine

As they proceed down the walkway Paul and Ngoc Lan navigate
around chatting NEIGHBORS and CHILDREN at play Murals and
graffiti adorn the walls and the rickety railings are
reinforced with dental floss

INT NGOC LAN’S APARTMENT - DAY

Ngoc Lan and Paul enter this tiny apartment decorated with
improvised furnishings -- a table made from a spray can lid
chairs carved out of champagne corks curtains fashioned from
old handkerchiefs

Most striking are the images of BUTTERFLIES cut from normal-
size magazines used to cover the walls

Ngoc Lan pulls back a curtain to reveal GLADYS a barely
conscious Salvadoran woman lying on a piece of foam

NGOC LAN
This lady Gladys Gladys my friend
She very sick

(loudly)
Gladys how you feel éCdémo esta
éComo esta I bring food for you I

Gladys offers Paul a weak hopeful smile

NGOC LAN
Husband head explode Head explode
From teeth She come here alone no

(pointing)
Okay you take care for her

As Ngoc Lan goes to fill a pail from a crude faucet Paul has
a wave of panic and pulls her aside

PAUL
I can’t do anything for her That
woman is really sick She looks like
she might die

NGOC LAN
Oh yes she die soon Cancer Cancer
all over stomach I be with her die
Most bad thing die alone

Ngoc Lan kneels at Gladys’s side and gives her water

NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
(loud whisper)
Come on be like doctor Make her
feel good
(to Gladys)
Hombre médico

Paul draws a deep breath and assumes the role he’s been asked
to play squatting down and dredging up his medical Spanish

PAUL
Hola senora éDonde le duele

GLADYS
Ay doctor me duele todo todo Ya
no me queda mucho tiempo en esta
vida

Ngoc Lan reaches into her sack and begins placing bottle after
bottle of drugs onto a table

NGOC LAN
Which pill good for her How much
she take

PAUL
I have no idea

NGOC LAN
But you know things One two five
what Which one most strong

PAUL
That one Percocet

NGOC LAN
(opening it)
Yes Percocet Very good for pain

PAUL

NGOC LAN

Paul helps her administer the pills

PAUL
These are for the pain

GLADYS
Gracias doctor

PAUL
You rest now

Gladys closes her eyes

PAUL (CONTD)
Have you been moving her around You
know like every few hours You
don’t want her to get bed sores

Ngoc Lan shakes her head

PAUL (CONTD)
Here Let’s move her

He instructs Ngoc Lan with gestures and they begin to roll
Gladys onto her side

NGOC LAN
See You know things

LATER -- Gladys now lies in a narcotized state

NGOC LAN (CONTD)
Thank you Mr Dusan friend You help
Gladys good

PAUL
Now let’s make those adjustments for
you
(reaching for his tools)
I’1l just need you to remove your
foot

NGOC LAN
Not now I very tired You go

With no further ceremony Ngoc Lan goes and busies herself in
the kitchen

PAUL
Well Some other time I guess I
just don’t know when I’m going to see
you again

NGOC LAN
You come Thursday okay Thursday
morning you fix leg You come ten
oclock

At a loss Paul opens the front door
PAUL
My name’s Paul by the way Paul

Safranek

Ngoc Lan glances up and gives a little nod Paul takes a last
look at this strange creature then leaves

EXT ALONDRA APARTMENTS - NIGHT 158

It’s dark now As Paul exits the building his attention is
drawn by whooping and shouting

A jubilant GROUP OF MEN have just rolled up a normal-sized can
of TECATE BEER On the count of “Uno dos tres” they hoist
it up and begin to spin it and shake it

Finally they drop it on the ground and with practiced ease
one of them punctures the can with a screwdriver sending a
geyser of beer high into the air

They roll the can this way and that to guide the spray into
their mouths Others laugh as they are hosed down with beer

Paul watches wistful at the spectacle of this simple
pleasure

INT TOLL-FREE CALL CENTER - DAY 159

Paul squints at his monitor painfully aware of the
senselessness of his job

PAUL
Let’s see Extra Large is still
available in glacier pebble tulip
cayenne moss and aubergine

WOMAN (ON PHONE)

PAUL
More of a brownish red Like brick

WOMAN (ON PHONE)

PAUL

Paul tosses his headset on his desk and walks away

INT ALONDRA SEVENTH FLOOR - DAY 160

Carrying a small canvas bag Paul knocks on Ngoc Lan’s door

PAUL

NGOC LAN

PAUL

loosens her leg

PAUL

make a few adjustments and I can

Ngoc Lan slides the prosthesis off and hands it over
LATER -- Paul works on the crudely constructed foot pushing 162
and pulling on the hinges and springs Now on CRUTCHES Ngoc

Lan manages to bring him a cup of tea

PAUL (CONTD)
Oh thank you Very nice
NGOC LAN

stubborn coupling and -- KKRCH -- the joint pops apart and
the entire prosthetic collapses in his hands

NGOC LAN (CONTD)

Paul tries awkwardly to shield the broken foot from view

PAUL
Nothing I think I just --

A spring and a bolt or two drop noisily onto the floor

clutches her crutches

them a fully uniformed and humiliated Paul

makes out a SKIFF pulling alongside the yacht and TWO NEW
PASSENGERS helped off the skiff and onto the yacht

EXT KONRAD’S YACHT - DAY 182

An unshaven Paul emerges onto the deck and is about to head to
the wheelhouse when he notices --

seated on the rear deck conversing The woman leans forward
to clasp one of Ngoc Lans hands in empathy and consolation

Paul makes his way astern

NGOC LAN
Look Paul This Jorgen Asbjrnsen

It’s humbling no Nature is such a
patient sculptor -- grinding a tiny
bit each day slowly slowly for
thousands of years to make such a
supremely beautiful thing

(overcome with sadness)
What a waste What a dreadful waste

Dr Asbjrnsen rises and shuffles away muttering to himself
in Norwegian

ANNE-HELENE

You’1ll have to excuse Jorgen These
past few days have been especially
hard Such a big decision to make
And so quickly Normally when we
visit the Colony we like to take the
train and spend a few days in Narvik
But then the news came and well
here we are suddenly imposing on
you We scarcely had time to pack

PAUL
I’m sorry but what news

ANNE-HELENE
Why the methane release In
Antarctica You must know about the
methane

PAUL
Sure But that’s not new right I
mean --

ANNE-HELENE
New or old it’s the end The end of
everything
(rising)
I’m sorry I should check on
Jorgen

183 INT GALLEY - DUSK 183

All aboard have gathered for dinner around a table and listen
intently to the great man in their midst

DR ASBJRNSEN
The Earth has already seen five
major extinctions and now there
will be another I didn’t want to
believe it none of us did But
there we were in Helsinki big and
small -- climatologists biologists
physicists demographers
immunologists 26 Nobel Prize
winners among us We built all the
models did all the math and the
conclusion was consistent Homo
Sapiens will soon vanish from the
Earth The only question is when
Some say 500 years Some say sixty
Now with the terrible spike in
methane release it’s out of our
grasp Regardless how the end will
come -- unbreathable air impotable
water incurable disease
environmental catastrophe nuclear
winter likely a combination of them
all -- relatively soon the Earth
will indeed purge itself of human
life and God knows how many other
species It is now an actuarial
certainty

His mind reeling Paul looks at Ngoc Lan She has been
listening quietly but tears flow down her face

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONTD)

(pouring himself a drink)
Not a very successful species these
Homo Sapiens even with such great
intelligence Barely 200 thousand
years Alligator has survived 200
million years with a brain the size
of a walnut

PAUL
Do you really mean extinction What
about downsizing

DR ASBJRNSEN
Yeah yeah too little too late Only
3 of the world has miniaturized
There simply isn’t enough time Yes
extinction is exactly the correct word

EXT DECK - DUSK 184

Paul and Ngoc Lan lean against the railing soothed by the
stars and the wind

PAUL
People have been predicting the end
of the world for thousands of
years and now it’s really
happening I guess somebody had to
be right someday

NGOC LAN
So sad Very sad

They gaze at the moonlit landscape The moment is ripe for
love Ngoc Lan looks at Paul hoping he’1ll sense her need
but he seems oblivious and she starts to walk away

NGOC LAN (CONTD)
Sleep now Good night Paul

PAUL
Good night Ngoc Lan

Surprised by her abrupt departure Paul watches her go Then
she pauses emitting a barely audible grunt of pain

PAUL (CONTD)
You okay

NGOC LAN
I fine

PAUL
Maybe I should take a look

NGOC LAN
Okay Yes You look
INT NGOC LANS CABIN - NIGHT 185
Ngoc Lan lies on the bed with one pant leg rolled up
PAUL
Yeah that peg’s making the socket
chafe a little

Paul squeezes lotion into his palm and begins to massage the
tender skin of Ngoc Lan’s stump

PAUL (CONTD)
You know if someone had told me five
years ago that one day I’d be four
inches tall divorced helping a
famous Vietnamese dissident get a new
foot and cruising up a fjord in
Norway discussing the end of the
world with Jorgen Asbjrnsen I would
have said he was crazy

Paul notices she hasn’t been listening Her eyes are closed
and her head is tipped back She moans slightly

Paul stops massaging Ngoc Lan opens her eyes just enough to
give him a look then closes them again Summoning his
courage he lies down next to her and plants his lips on hers
She’s stiff and unresponsive so he stops
PAUL (CONTD)
I’m sorry I thought Jesus I’m
such an idiot

Ngoc Lan opens her eyes and gives Paul a look at once fierce
and vulnerable

NGOC LAN
No Please I want

Paul draws a deep breath eases his way close again and gives
her a few gentle kisses Ever so slowly she reciprocates

FADE OUT
UNDER BLACK -- 186

A STRANGE SOUND -- OOOOEEEEOOOOO

EXT KONRAD’S YACHT - MORNING

Zipping up parkas as they emerge onto the deck Ngoc Lan and
Paul discover a different landscape The walls of the fjord
are narrower the terrain even lusher

INT WHEEL HOUSE - MORNING 187

As Paul and Ngoc Lan enter Konrad and Dusan exchange a
knowing look There are no secrets on a boat

OOOEEEEOOOOOO

PAUL
What’s that sound

KONRAD
A greeting

Konrad blasts the foghorn in response When Ngoc Lan looks
away Dusan gives Paul a wink and makes a crude gesture Paul
responds with a glare that says “Cool it”

EXT ISLAND IN THE FJORD - MORNING 188

A tiny BEARDED MAN in rustic clothing stands on a cliff
blowing into a lacquered SNAIL SHELL OOOEEEEOOOOOO

EXT PORT - DAY 189

Motoring into a bay the boat approaches a loading dock A
few downsized fishing boats are moored in the harbor their
prows carved into dragon heads as an homage to Viking
heritage

No dwellings are in sight -- just the dock two cargo cranes
and a road leading away from port HORSE-DRAWN CARTS with
DRIVERS await the yacht’s arrival

EXT KONRAD’S YACHT - DAY 190

Dusan stands with Paul and Ngoc Lan at the railing

EXT HILLSIDE ROAD - DAY 191

Harnessed horses pull a wooden cart up a steep series of
switchbacks Paul Ngoc Lan Dusan and the Asbjgrnsens ride
together in back In the distance below cranes unload the
yacht’s cargo

EXT CART - DAY 192

Ngoc Lan is staggered by the immediacy and immensity of nature
from a small perspective -- trees tall as mountains leaves
broad as sails Paul shares the feeling but even more
delights in watching Ngoc Lan

NGOC LAN
I think never in my life I will see
some place so beautiful again

EXT HILLTOP - DAY 193

The cart crests a hill and pauses to enjoy the remarkable
view A lush valley cradles a village surrounded by tiered
fields Near the village are larger more modern buildings

ANNE-HELENE
All this land -- everything you see --
belonged for centuries to the
Edvardsen family It was Nellie
Edvardsen’s granddaughter Solveig who
arranged for us to use this place for
our settlement

DR ASBJRNSEN
Solveig will remind you of this many
times

ANNE-HELENE
Jorgen

DR ASBJ®RNSEN
(with distaste)
Solveig

PAUL
So that’s it The colony And
that’s the original dome Wow

DR ASBJ®RNSEN
We use it now as a social hall and
fitness center but yes this is
where we started

ANNE-HELENE
It was a wonderful time Remember
Jorgen

DR ASBJ®RNSEN
(wistful)
I remember

EXT VILLAGE - DAY 194

The cart passes through a gate and into the settlement a
marriage between a traditional Scandinavian village and a
modern eco-commune

The residents’ appearance suggests a life of communal values
and harmony with nature -- long hair sandals beards ruddy
cheeks rustic garments ALL RACES are represented

There’s a sense of urgency among the villagers as they bustle
about but they’re not too busy to cheer the Asbjgrnsens as
they pass The couple respond humbly with smiles and waves

CROWD
Papa Jorgen Mama Anne-Helene

195 EXT THE SHED - DAY 195

The cart stops near a large weathered SHED built into the
side of a hill A small welcoming party of SCIENTISTS and
ENGINEERS greet the new arrivals

SOLVEIG (0S)

Jorgen Anne-Helene Oh thank God
you’ve arrived Why didn’t anyone
tell me

All turn to see SOLVEIG EDVARDSEN running toward them A plus-
sized Norwegian woman in her 60s she’s hiking up the hem of
her long flowing garments to avoid the mud

DR ASBJ®RNSEN
(smiling stiffly)
Solveig

Solveig makes a big show of embracing the Asbjgrnsens drawing
them into her ample bosom

SOLVEIG
I love you I love you both so much
Ever since the decision I didn’t
feel right without you here And you
know how I am when I worry I can’t
eat I can’t sleep Ask anyone
here they’1l tell you My stomach
has been so upset like I want to
throw up all the time but can’t
And I’ve had an awful headache that
just won’t go away I know you know

about my headaches I love you so
much Thank God you’re here -- I
feel so much better now like a big
release

A FELLOW SCIENTIST comes to the rescue

FELLOW SCIENTIST
Sorry to interrupt Jorgen but we
need your advice immediately

DR ASBJRNSEN
Yes yes Excuse us Solveig

SOLVEIG
Of course darling You’ve got
important things to do I love you
You’re a genius

ANNE-HELENE
(heading away too)
You look wonderful Solveig

SOLVEIG
Really I do You really think so

ANNE-HELENE
Wonderful

SOLVEIG
(grateful )
Oh honey

Unplugged from the attention she craves Solveig latches onto
the other new arrivals

SOLVEIG (CONTD)
Dusan Dusan dear Dusan Bless
you for coming so quickly I love
you

DUSAN
(kissing her cheeks)
Solveig my darling I am always
happy to help -- in difficult times
in easy times in happy times Is
always a pleasure to visit you and
your lovely village

SOLVEIG
It is lovely isn’t it I can’t bear
to think I won’t see it again
(to Paul and Ngoc Lan)

You know I’m the one who made this
colony possible in the first place
I’ve been coming since I was just a
baby Papa used to fly us here every

summer in his float plane I
remember one time --
(to Paul)

Wait I know you

PAUL
Me

SOLVEIG
(gripping his arm)
I’m sure of it
(MORE )

SOLVEIG (CONTD)
You were in my dream last night I
was a little girl and I was afraid
and lonely but there you were
walking beside me

PAUL
Are you sure it was me Because
weve never --

SOLVEIG
You were a horse or a pony --
something very strong -- and I

instantly felt better Then I
mounted you and rode you through a
dangerous forest And here you are
Right before we leave Another
miracle You are coming with us
aren’t you

DUSAN
(jumping in)
Solveig darling listen we love
you but my friends and I are just
here for the delivery and then we
must go home

SOLVEIG
That’s really so sad We’d love it
if you’d join us

PAUL
I’m sorry did you say you’re
leaving

SOLVEIG
Oh Yes All of us Didn’t anyone
tell you

PAUL
Where are you going

Solveig points at the shed -- isn’t it obvious

SOLVEIG
In there Would you like to see
(leading them to Dusan)
You did remember my hand cream
didn’t you I couldn’t survive
without it

INT THE SHED - DAY

Solveig escorts the group inside To Paul and Ngoc Lans
surprise they find that the rustic shelter conceals the

entrance to --

A LARGE TUNNEL disappearing into the mountain like a mine

shaft

NGOC LAN
Where it go

SOLVEIG
To China

(giggling)

I’m sorry forgive me Sometimes I’m

so silly No to the vault

PAUL
The vault

SOLVEIG
Oh yes We’ve been working on it
almost since the very beginning
Actually not many people know this
but it was my idea

DUSAN
Of course it was You’re always
thinking ahead

SOLVEIG
When Jorgen made his big discovery I
said look Jorgen you’re a genius
and downsizing is a genius idea No
one’s questioning that No one But
what if people don’t accept it What
if it doesn’t catch on in time Look
at me -- you know it took me years
before I did it I had to sell my
antiques and find homes for my cats
They’re very old and one of them is
diabetic needs two shots every day
It was a complete nightmare Anyway
this is what they came up with On
my suggestion

Solveig leads Ngoc Lan and Paul toward TORVALD
seated at a control panel

SOLVEIG (CONT’D)
Torvald be a sweetheart and give our
friends a little tour

an engineer
TORVALD
The tunnel leads to a vault 16
kilometers inside the Earth’s
lithosphere and encased in a double
layer of Inconel 625

Torvald points at an array of MONITORS displaying high-angle
views of streets homes farms and pastures

TORVALD (CONTD)
In addition to maintaining a broad
spectrum of biodiversity the vault
is equipped with fields for growing
foods forests for lumber livestock
for animal husbandry The
residential areas are spacious and
easily expandable to provide for
future generations

PAUL
Wait that’s not underground

SOLVEIG
Of course it is Our new size makes
it possible Otherwise we never
could have dreamed of preserving so
much of the world in a single safe
place

PAUL
This is brilliant
(to Ngoc Lan)
Isn’t this brilliant Like Noah’s Ark

SOLVEIG
That’s exactly what I told Jorgen
It’s Noah’s Ark

PAUL
What kind of power are you using
nuclear

TORVALD

No no 100 geothermal
Interoperable organic systems
manage production of artificial
sunlight oxygen CO2 elimination
water purification and so forth

As Paul soaks everything up Ngoc Lan takes his hand
PAUL

So how long will you stay down
there

SOLVEIG
What is it Torvald Eight thousand
years

TORVALD

(lips pursed)
Something like that Until the
surface environment stabilizes

INT COMMUNITY DINING HALL - NIGHT

All the villagers -- perhaps 250 -- dine together at long
wooden tables Tonight the atmosphere is electric

Paul and Ngoc Lan sit near the Asbjrnsens and other
SCIENTISTS who between chews dispassionately explain the
project at hand Konrad and Dusan sit nearby

ONE SCIENTIST
You know it’s not unprecedented what
we are doing Less than a hundred
thousand years ago humans experienced
a near-extinction Maybe 2000
survived And from that handful came
all the billions of people you see
today

ANOTHER SCIENTIST
Rebooting the species Nothing new

Glasses clink Dr Asbjrnsen rises Never a comfortable
public speaker he scans the faces turned his way

DR ASBJRNSEN
My friends Many years ago when we
discovered cellular miniaturization
the world which had seemed so doomed
felt suddenly so full of
possibilities We knew we had found
the portal to the next stage of man’s
evolution So until very recently I
maintained hope that the contingency
plan we embark upon tomorrow could
remain simply that -- a plan

He pauses reigning in his emotions

DR ASBUJ®RNSEN (CONTD)
But history has spoken and this is
our final dinner in the place we’ve
called home for so many years And
here on this beautiful little island

(MORE)

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONTD)
(noticing Solveig’s look)
-- this island which Solveig
Edvardsen had the vision and
generosity to provide us

Solveig nods proudly

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONTD)
-the very survival of mankind rests
in our hands Yes we are sad to
leave and terribly sad for the
reasons why but man is too beautiful
too improbable a life form to be
allowed to disappear forever from the
cosmos

(Norwegian)

It is no shame to look into the warm
spring sun and regret a lost limb

The Norwegians present nod and murmur in agreement Someone
uses the moment to hand Asbjgrnsen a note

DR ASBUJRNSEN (CONTD)
Ah yes The kitchen staff wishes to
remind everyone that after you scrape
your plates you should place them in
the stacking carts not the dish
washing belts

(clearing his throat)

Now then I would like to ask the
surviving members of the original
colony to stand

Twenty people solemnly rise Most are in their fifties or
older but among them we recognize one handsome young man

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONTD)
Look at him -- Little Ronni how he’s
grown

As Ronni smiles we note a herpes sore on his upper lip

DR ASBJRNSEN (CONT’D)

(addressing the originals)
I ask you again as I asked you so
many years ago Generations to come -
- perhaps all of humanity -- will
thank you for your bravery and
commitment But you must ask
yourself whether you are truly ready
to enter a new world For there will
be no turning back Are you ready
LITTLE RONNI
I am ready

ORIGINAL COLONY MEMBERS
Yes I am ready Yes

Tears and embraces throughout the room

DR ASBJRNSEN
Is everyone ready

Shouts of “I am ready” coalesce into an ebullient group chant
of “We are ready”

Konrad Ngoc Lan and Dusan are moved to witness these
momentous proceedings but Paul’s reaction is even more
profound Something deep inside him is awakening

198 EXT VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

Residents throw furniture into a BONFIRE Drunken men sing
Viking songs A hypnotic drum beat inspires dancing

DUSAN
Konrad what do you think Is the end
of civilization really coming so
soon

KONRAD
Look here My uncle used to say he
was born during the Austro-Hungarian
Empire then outlived both the Third
Reich and Communism all three of
which were supposed to last forever
In the 1930s they discovered a
pyramid in Egypt -- a pyramid --
when a camel stubbed its toe How
does one lose a pyramid Or look up
at the sky So many of those bright
bright stars went dark before humans
even existed -- we just don’t know it
yet All things come to an end Why
shouldn’t we But look at the
positive side -- if our world really
is coming to an end it’s fascinating
to be watching

199 EXT HILLSIDE ABOVE VILLAGE - NIGHT

Paul sits alone deep in thought looking down at the tunnel
entrance

The shed has been dismantled and work lights illuminate a
parade of carts heading inside loaded with supplies

Ngoc Lan approaches struggling up the hill

NGOC LAN
Where you go I look many place for
you
PAUL
I’ve been here
NGOC LAN
(sitting)

I talk with Dusan he say fat lady
pay he ready go back I happy for
that Too long time away from Senor
Cardenas and Mrs Lopez I worry too
much for them

PAUL
Ngoc Lan you can’t just be worried
about a few little people thousands
of miles away You have to look at
the big picture

NGOC LAN
Why you say like this

PAUL

Because Mr Cardenas Mrs Lopez
they don’t stand a chance none of us
do

(gesturing)
All of this -- it’s over Can’t
you see what’s going on This is a
defining moment in human history
More than that -- in the history of
the universe And for some reason
you and I are here

NGOC LAN
You want go with them

PAUL
And I want you to come with me

NGOC LAN
You crazy man Always I know you
stupid Now I see you crazy too

PAUL
How am I crazy You heard them
This is the only chance for the
survival of our species -- that’s
huge You want to help people
These are the people you should be
helping The future of humanity is
down that hole

NGOC LAN
Who you help down there People here
needs help not down stupid hole

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT

Ngoc Lan pulls Paul by the hand toward Dusan and Konrad by
now quite drunk

NGOC LAN
Dusan Konrad talk to crazy Paul
He say he want go down hole me go
with him

DUSAN
Paul Paul Paul Paul Why would
you do such a silly thing

PAUL
Why not

DUSAN
Because you will live the rest of
your life in a hole in the ground
Like a worm

PAUL
These people are saving the human
race and I want to help

DUSAN
Okay fine you want to help Then
do what I did -- give them a semen
sample

KONRAD

I did too That’s a much more
pleasant way to help

PAUL
If I’m not supposed to be a part of
this thing then why am I here I
look at my life and I I’m a nobody
(MORE )

PAUL (CONTD)
But now I connect the dots and see
it’s all been leading me here Why
didn’t I become a doctor Why did I
downsize Why did my wife abandon me
Dusan how did you just happen to be
my neighbor Ngoc Lan why were you
the only one to survive that box and
just happen to be cleaning Dusan’s
place that day And if you hadn’t
lost your leg I wouldn’t have tried
to help you -- which as usual I
screwed up And why did I screw up
So I could wind up here at exactly the
right time to go into that tunnel I
finally have the chance to do
something that matters

DUSAN
Paul come on you really are
talking crazy These people
they’re wonderful but --

KONRAD
It’s like a cult

DUSAN
It’s like a cult And the
extinction’s not happening for you
know maybe few hundred years Has
nothing to do with you Forget it
Have a drink Besides you think they
won’t behave as people always behave
They’re all going to go insane down
there and kill each other They will
go extinct long before we do

Paul searches the faces of his three friends seeing them as
both allies and enemies Then he turns and marches off into
the night Ngoc Lan watches him go her heart breaking

DUSAN (CONTD)
Don’t worry darling He said it
himself Nothing he ever wants to
do works out

EXT FIELD OUTSIDE VILLAGE - DAY
The Bacchanal continues on a beautiful sunny day Around a
pond villagers sunbathe picnic and skinny dip Others

siphon vodka from a bottle lying on its side

Now dressed in “native” loose-fitting clothes and clogs Paul
dances with a group near the drum circle
Ngoc Lan approaches shyly stopping a few feet away
notices and heads over

PAUL
Beautiful day huh Knowing it’s the
last time I’1l see the real sun makes
it so vibrant

NGOC LAN
I ask you question You say me
truth Okay
(he nods)
Other night on boat what kind of
fuck you give me

PAUL

PAUL

NGOC LAN

PAUL
Look I don’t know where you heard

NGOC LAN
Third host family

PAUL
That’s just stupid There’s a
whole spectrum of emotions
and motivations And you
shouldnt say “fuck” It’s vulgar

Say “make love” or something I

NGOC LAN
So was love fuck
PAUL

Paul
NGOC LAN
You look for me you want help me

NGOC LAN
You Paul Safranek You good man

VILLAGERS (0S)
Look Look

BUTTERFLIES big as kites flutter overhead

PAUL
Look Ngoc Lan Butterflies Kon
booyem Kon booyem

Even this miraculous sight cannot lift her sadness

202 LATER -- The villagers have amassed to watch the SUNSET No 202
one moves No one speaks

A WOMAN atop a rock sings a haunting Viking song of farewell
SOLEMN FACES many streaked by tears are lit by the golden

setting sun Among them we see the Asbjgrnsens standing with
great dignity and Solveig sobbing a bit too loudly

Despite wounded feelings Ngoc Lan recognizes it’s the last
time she will see Paul and she allows herself to slip her arm
around his waist He places an arm over her shoulder

The sun vanishes its amber light now streaked by pinks
greens and blues Spontaneous applause Now the residents
turn to walk slowly toward the tunnel

EXT TUNNEL - NIGHT 203

The departure nears completion The last of the carts
disappear inside the final residents following on foot
Torvald waits nearby preparing to seal the tunnel

Ngoc Lan Dusan and Konrad stand with Paul

PAUL
I guess this is it

DUSAN
It seems so

PAUL
Konrad Very nice to have met you

KONRAD
Pleasure was mine Good luck in
there Paul

Paul turns to Dusan and pulls him into a firm embrace

DUSAN
Take care of yourself

PAUL
I will You too

DUSAN
I will miss my funny neighbor

Paul nods then turns to face Ngoc Lan At a loss he
tries hugging her but she remains limp in his arms

PAUL
Ngoc Lan

She places something into his hands

PAUL (CONTD)
Your bible
(off her nod)
But it’s in Vietnamese

NGOC LAN
Words not matter Remember me

Paul leans in to kiss her but she offers only her cheek He
looks at the tunnel then back at Ngoc Lan her eyes downcast

NGOC LAN (CONT’D)
You go now

Paul turns and heads resolutely toward the tunnel clutching
the bible and dragging his wheelie suitcase

204 INT TUNNEL - NIGHT 204

Lit by lights strung along the walls a stream of villagers
march silently and steadily toward their destiny

At the rear Paul walks with an erect dignified bearing
Nothing in his life approaches the magnitude of this moment He
feels many things at once -- pride fear excitement regret

Soon the tunnel begins an incline and Paul trots forward to
speak with a fit Nigerian guy named TUNDE

PAUL
Excuse me Why are we going up I
thought the vault was --

TUNDE
Prevents flooding
(offering his hand)
Tunde

PAUL
Paul

TUNDE
Just a few hours climb before we
begin the descent to the vault

PAUL
And how long is the whole walk

TUNDE
Eleven hours Something like that
(pulling ahead)
See you down there Stay hydrated

Paul slows to a stop as the last villagers pass him by
Suddenly he hears a SIREN and senses a flashing RED LIGHT He

turns to look back at the tunnel opening now 100 meters
behind Torvald is there cranking the tunnel door shut

EXT NEARBY HILL - NIGHT 205

From a vantage point atop an incline Dusan Konrad and Ngoc
Lan somberly watch the door closing

EXT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 206

The door is nearly shut when from behind it comes a muffled
panicked cry

PAUL (0S)
WAIT

The door stops then reopens slightly Paul squeezes out

PAUL (CONTD)
Thanks Torvald Thanks
(jerking something)
My bag Do you think you could --

TORVALD (0S)
Leave it

PAUL
But --

TORVALD (0S)
You need to get away from here

PAUL
Okay sure Yeah

TORVALD (0S)
Run

Paul releases the bag and sprints away

EXT NEARBY HILL - NIGHT 207

Dusan Konrad and Ngoc Lan have taken cover behind rocks
Dusan peeks out and breaking into a smile invites the
others to witness Paul scrambling up the hill in a panicked
zig-zag

DUSAN
What did I tell you Nothing ever
works out for this guy

NGOC LAN
Paul

Paul spots his friends runs straight into Ngoc Lans arms

PAUL
(out of breath)
I was thinking about what you said

and I realized you’re right
I am Paul Safranek And what
you were asking It was a love
fuck

Ngoc Lan bursts into tears of happiness and embraces him
tightly

KA-BOOM An EXPLOSION above the tunnel entrance creates a
landslide which tumbles down to conceal it forever Our
friends take cover but they needn’t have -- it’s all small
scale so the dirt falls pathetically

Soon they emerge from behind the rocks

NGOC LAN
Okay now we go back Leisureland
Okay Dusan Konrad Paul You
promise Nothing more here We go
now

The three men stare at her reminded once again what a
monomaniac she can be

EXT KONRAD’S REAR DECK - DAYBREAK

Paul Dusan and Ngoc Lan watch the island recede as the yacht

sails out of the harbor amid the rising sun

TERGEHL (VO)
And so it was that Safraptil the
Good forsook salvation in order to
return to Lohserlund with Princess
Noc to care for the sick and
crippled of our ancestors

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Tergehl has reached the end of the story and sits back to
gauge its effect on his listeners

LITTLE BOY
Then what happened

TERGEHL
That is the end little ones
There is nothing more to tell
(MORE )

TERGEHL (CONTD)
We know nothing more of Safrapiil
nor of Princess Noc nor of
Drooshan the Cunning nor of the
sacrifices they made

EXT CAVE - NIGHT

Across a moonlit desolate landscape we see the cave high on
a hill illuminated by the fire within

TERGEHL (0S)
But that is why each year at the
feast commemorating the Great Exodus
we leave an empty seat for Safrapiil
so that we remember all those who
remained behind and suffered through
the hell to come

INT AIRPLANE —- DAY

Paul looks out the window He seems now genuinely clear-
headed aware awake

PAUL
To think one day all of this --

NGOC LAN
Now maybe you understand little bit
how I feel after survive TV box

Paul looks at her takes her hand
NGOC LAN (CONT’D)

When you know death come soon you
look around things more close

INT LEISURELAND SHUTTLE - DAY

A PORTER slides Ngoc Lan and Paul’s carrier into place and
locks it down

Paul glances over at MELANIE and CJ a normal-size couple
seated exactly where he and Audrey sat so many lifetimes
ago They look like nice people honest and bright-eyed

PAUL
Hi there
