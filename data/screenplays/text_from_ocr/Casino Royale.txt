cable heading for the top of the crane Bond makes the
precarious leap onto the concrete block

Crowds of workers are riveted by the spectacle They watch
as Bond goes after Bomber two small specks hundreds of

feet in the air Bomber is at the top climbing into the
arm Bond knows he has to get up there fast so he kicks
the quick release lever on the side of the pulley mechanism
