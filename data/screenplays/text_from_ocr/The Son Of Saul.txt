IE GROVE UNDRESSING ROOM PASSAGE -— MORNING
IN A GROVE
Trees

A gentle warm light shines on the face of a 40 year-old
looking man as he walks in what seems to be a grove

His name is SAUL AUSLANDER He wears a white shirtunder his
dark jacket with a half-hidden number on it B-7005On the
back of his jacket a red X is painted He wears a flat
civilian hat He walks with determination at a regular pace
his lips tight The trees around give some shelter from the
sun birds sing amidst the branches

He stops for a while and glances around at some older people
around taking off their heavy winter coats sitting on the
grass The voices of children calling for water can be
heardA YOUNG BOY stands on the side carrying a water can

Sounds of branch cracking of steps on the ground Footsteps
of many more people Pieces of words can be heard ina
continuous humming of different voices and languages

Behind Saul children play Someone comes to him and talks to
him he mumbles something looks away and moves on

Four other SONDERKOMMANDO PRISONERS pass Saul by They all
start instructing the civilians to get up and leave The
civilians are gathered in rows of 5 and pushed to the road

Three SOLDIERS appear on the side waiting

Orders are shouted and the group starts advancing on the
slight slope of a dusty road

The Sonderkommando prisoners accompany the civilians who
carry suitcases bundles cans and other objects Some people

carry infants We only catch glimpses of some of the faces
and clothes These are weary slightly disorientated faces
most of them in dark-colored heavy clothes

On Saul’s right a large GROUP OF PEOPLE walks as well
quietly

Saul looks in the direction of the people beside him as if
to check His pace slows down other people catch up with
him Some of them stare at him Saul doesn’t engage with
them

The group comes to a halt Saul faces them but keeps on

walking quietly Further down some of the people have taken
off their heavy winter coats and sit on the grass

Saul advances in the midst of a CROWD of agitated people and
briefly looks to the side at kneeling crying figures

The road turns to an open range where isolated PEOPLE in gray
and green clothes point in one direction at the chaos of
whirling humans in heavy dark clothes and carrying suitcases
or bundles

Orders are shouted and repeated first in German followed by
other languages

In the background civilians get off from wagons of a
merchandise train Smoke rises from afar Heaps of personal
belongings pile up next to the train OLD and CROOKED PEOPLE
are put onto one TRUCK The truck departs and draws nearer
Another truck is loaded with personal belongings

The rhythm of the advancing accelerates Sonderkommando
prisoners reacting to German orders by pushing the people
further

Suddenly Saul and his comrades from the Sonderkommando
suddenly stop They take off their flat hats and lower their
heads Two SS OFFICERS pass them by

Saul goes on
Saul walks faster advancing in the large crowd

Near the crowd OLD PEOPLE disembark from a military truck

He passes a group of people undressing

Saul walks down a few steps that lead to a large underground
hall

IN THE UNDERGROUND HALL (UNDRESSING HALL)

A feeble artificial light replaces the sunlight that fades
away People from behind enter the hall

In a distance the voice of an SS MAN catches the attention
of the people around Saul - a long quietly uttered monologue
in German Saul remains on the side of the underground he
watches the people His face barely reflects any expression
but tiredness

The voice stops talking The people next to Saul start doing
something Next to Saul a MAN puts two fingers on the
highest button of his messy shirt and hesitates Saul looks
at the man who finally undoes his shirt Saul leans and
picks up the man’s clothes on the ground He gathers more of
the clothes lying on the ground and puts them on the side

A MAN in a jacket with a painted red X over it is helping an
ELDERLY WOMAN to remove pins from a shawl Next to them
other people go on undressing Naked women pass him by and
pudently hide in a corner

Reassuring voices speaking in different languages can be
heard but only fragments make their way to him “hot meal”
and “hurry up”

MAN IN THE CROWD (0S)
(in Hungarian)
You have to remember the number

Saul goes to a corner in the corridor and stands still He is
soon joined by other MEN IN WHITE SHIRTS They don’t talk
Next to him naked people walk further down Saul’s face is
blank as we catch a glimpse at the huge crowd passing him
by Voices rise questions in various languages then fade
away

The last naked people agitated are being pushed into the
other hall by men in uniform

The sound of a heavy door closing
The men in uniform leave

Saul and the other men in white shirts collect the clothes
hanging on the racks and throw them on the ground Cries
surround them

A bald MAN comes near Saul still taking the clothes out of
the racks The bald man speaks in a low voice to the man next
to Saul a strong man in his thirties LANDESMAN The bald
man looks at Saul

BALD MAN
(in Yiddish)
You too
Saul leaves with Landesman They enter a smaller corridor
The cries are louder Landesman opens a door on the right
They go inside There await several other MEN IN WHITE SHIRT
faces turned to the ground

CUT TO
INT KREMATORIUM - GAS CHAMBER PASSAGE TUNNEL - DAY

A gas chamber with plaster walls Artificial light comes down
from a low ceiling

Shooting Draft April 25 2014

A low long noise of a heavy industrial fan before stopping
with reverberation

Saul is hosing the ground mechanically slowly directing the
hose here and there his face focused

In the BACKGROUND human FIGURES come and go rapidly Some
draw nearer Saul and start pulling backward and then OFF
SCREEN heavy loads

TWO MEN around Saul seem to struggle with something below
Saul turns off the hose and leans toward the ground He helps
the men

The men carry away their load

The figures around Saul move increasingly fast quietly as
if commanded by invisible fear and discipline

A low whimper can be heard from underneath

Saul tries to look for the source of the whimper

He freezes

A light-haired man comes near him He is 30 but looks 50 his
name is HIRSCH He wears the same clothes as Saul His deeply
set eyes look down with worry at the source of the whimper
Hirsch waves at someone OFF SCREEN

Another prisoner who seems to have more authority draws
closer He is a short but strong young man in his late
twenties and a foreman in the Kommando He is called

FEIGENBAUM He looks towards the source of the whimper and
hurries away

Saul watches as Hirsch lifts up the bruised corpse of an
ADOLESCENT BOY with dark-brown hair Hirsch carries it to one
corner of the tunnel and puts it onto a bench that another
MAN has grabbed from the undressing room

Saul follows Hirsch with his eyes

Behind the scene dozens of PRISONERS rapidly carry out their
routine regardless of the agonising boy Some are pouring
water Some others take heavy loads to a freight-elevator A
WELL DRESSED MAN walks around stops now and then writing
down information assisted by a prisoner A few SS GUARDS
dressed in green and gray armed watch over the scene

Behind them Feigenbaum comes back with a short man in a
white gown a Jewish doctor called MIKLOS From closer his
gown looks less maculate it is full of stains and dirt

Shooting Draft April 25 2014
He walks towards the bench Saul walks closer to them On the

bench lays a boy around twelve years old Mikldé6s looks at
the boy with weary eyes

He hardly has the time to put a hand on the boy’s body that
from behind a tall SS DOCTOR arrives a white medical gown
over his SS uniform Miklos steps aside He talks quietly in
German with a Hungarian accent

MIKLOS
(in German)
Still breathes

The SS Doctor takes a stethoscope out of his pocket and
coldly examines the boy He invites the Jewish doctor to
touch the boy’s throat

The members of the Sonderkommando working behind have
somewhat slowed down their pace some seem to glance
furtively at the scene

The SS doctor puts his gloved hand on the boy’s mouth Miklos
looks up at the SS doctor The hand moves to recover the nose
as well

The whimper stops

The SS doctor whispers in Miklos’s ear
Orders are shouted behind to accelerate the processes
An SS GUARD is drawn to the little group
SS GUARD I
(in German to Hirsch)
Back to work fast
He lifts up his stick but Hirsch already hurries back to the

gas chamber The guard then turns to Saul who gets back to
work

The SS doctor takes off his glove and puts it into his
pocket He looks around vaguely observing the members of the
Sonderkommando who accelerate their work Lost in his
thoughts as if he had already forgotten the incident he
goes away

Saul looks back at the scene and draws towards the bench
His eyes are focused on the body

Miklos steps back

Shooting Draft April 25 2014

MIKLOS
(in German)
I only saw this once before that
girl some time ago

He looks at Feigenbaum Feigenbaum stays quiet waiting for
orders Behind Saul is already very close

MIKLOS (CONTD)

(in Germanto Feigenbaum)
He ordered an autopsy Bring it to
the room will you

Miklos leaves

Feigenbaum sighs and approaches the bench Saul stands up in
front of him and tries to utter words in Yiddish

SAUL
(in broken Yiddish)
I’1l do it

Saul turns his back on Feigenbaum and seizes the body
Feigenbaum stands before him - he looks at Saul

FEIGENBAUM
(in Yiddish)
What’s it to you

Saul doesn’t answer and goes into the corridor with the body
in his arms

Saul enters the autopsy room of the Krematorium carrying the
lifeless body and stops

The autopsy room is a room with a tiny window on the side and

a door half open on another room where FIGURES seem to be
moving at times

Shooting Draft April 25 2014

In the middle of the room stands Miklos the Jewish doctor
On a stained stone operating table he examines the insides
of a corpse laid out An ASSISTANT prisoner of the
Sonderkommando stands next to him taking notes and assisting
him

Barely glancing up at Saul Miklos signals to Saul a bench on
the side of the room Beside the bench all sorts of medical
instruments can be seen

Saul seems to stiffen upon seeing these instruments

MIKLOS
(in German)
Just put it there

Saul does not move

MIKLOS (CONTD)
(in German)
Just put it there Now

Saul looks at the doctor

SAUL
(in Hungarian hesitating)

Miklos looks at Saul
MIKLOS
(in Hungarian)

He keeps dissecting

The assistant comes to Saul and takes the body from him and

brings the body to a bench

Saul follows the body to the bench

The assistant keeps looking at Saul then returns to the
table

Too much smoke

Prisoners drag corpses

The visibility decreases The guards on the side are
engulfed the men around become figures

In the smoke the excited shouts of Mietek the Polish kapo
can be heard He swears in Polish

KATZ

Damn Mietek

Katz opens the wooden case turns to Saul and hands him a
screwdriver

KATZ (CONTD)
(in Yiddish)
Repair the door but look out You
understand You watch

He shows where to use the screwdriver on the door and
disappears inside

Saul looks around and back at the door He starts to undo
the large lock but keeps looking at the field as a
sentinel

On the field the smoke is lifted by a sudden breeze and
everything becomes clearer the excited kapo the prisoners

of the Sonderkommando burning bodies under the sun

In the shadow Katz is kneeling on the floor assembling a
device he takes from his case It is a small homemade camera

Saul withdraws and looks back at the field

In the distance Biederman looks in Saul’s direction soon
engulfed by smoke as it spreads again

Saul turns to the door and finishes to undo the lock
SAUL

Saul looks back at the field

smoke

Inside Katz orients the camera toward the field He waits
for the smoke to clear

Saul looks back at the field Biederman has disappeared
Only smoke can be seen

Silence All the voices have died out

He rushes inside the house

He snatches the camera from Katz’s hands who looks at him
stunned

The dark-faced man doesn’t seem to understand Saul

Watched by an SS GUARD the men climb onto the back of an
open truck A heavy canvas covers the load of the truck so
the men have to stand on the edge of the platform

Saul mechanically turns a bit his head upon hearing the notes
of a violin in the distance Other men do the same

The music ceases as the engine of the truck is started

The field is left behind as the truck enters a quiet wood in
the soft autumn light under clear skies

The men are standing together against each other Saul
closes his eyes for a brief moment

An SS GUARD pushes his stick against Saul’s ribs Saul looks
back at the guard A blue-eyed young man looks back at Saul
with an innocent gaze

Saul looks at the truck moving behind them full of
prisoners In the crowd stands a man reddish scars below his
ears It’s the RENEGADE

CUT TO

EXT “ASH” RIVER AND WOODS - DAY
Saul is throwing ashes into the river

Behind him many prisoners are unloading enormous quantities
of ash onto trolleys that are taken to the edge of the water
Around him men use shovels to disperse the ashes into the
water Underneath them thick canvasses are being put down
keeping the ashes from the ground

Shovels plunge at regular pace and throw the ash into the
air rapidly creating a thick and gray curtain of dust before
reaching the surface of the water in tiny whirlpools The
rapid flow of water takes away the dust in seconds A few
coughs here and there can be heard

Saul glances around He sees the Renegade working
relentlessly a little further along the river bank

Shooting Draft April 25 2014

His feet in the water Saul manages to swap his position with
another prisoner so he can be next to the Renegade who keeps
a low profile With a harsh gaze and tight lips the Renegade
throws the ashes into the river

Saul also keeps workingwith his feet in the water He gazes
at the Renegade

SAUL
(in broken Yiddish in a
low and excited voice)

The other goes on as if he had not heard He doubles his
effort

He looks for a reaction
SAUL (CONTD)

The last words have been covered by the sudden outburst of
shouting by an SS GUARD

Saul discreetly looks back

Armed SS guards watch over the operations while on the side
a few SS officers are gathered in a group

Mietek and a KAPO supervise the work

Behind a PRISONER of the kommando has spilled some ash onto
the ground

hands

Saul throws the shovel in the water

The Renegade with blank face advances in the water that
quickly reaches his shoulders

Saul at first shocked finally lets his own shovel fall onto
the ground and enters the water He swims towards the
drowning man

Behind the SS guards start shouting They shoot at the two
men in the river

One prisoner runs to them to help He is shot and fallsto
the water

Saul reaches the renegade his arm keeping the man’s head
above the water But the renegade tries to free himself as
if to drown

The two heads disappear below the surface for a few seconds
Saul’s head emerges again as he carries the barely conscious
renegade back to the bank

A tall SS officer appears on the bank his name is BUSCH

BUSCH

Saul pulls the renegade toward the shore The man’s eyes
slowly return to life Saul grabs the man to his body keeping

his head up

The renegade closes his eyes

On the bank two kapos already wait for Saul and the
renegade

Saul is almost out of strength

The two men barely have the time to rise to their knees they
are lifted and taken by the SS guards to the officers BUSCH
looks at the two dripping men with curiosity

BUSCH

He points at the renegade

The renegade is completely in distress and mutters something
incomprehensible in Greek

camp prisoners dressed in rags coming back from road work
barely alive carrying heavy tools and covered in dust

Saul’s group stops in front of the checkpoint

Not far from them on the other side of the road the battered

group also stops

From the other side of the checkpoint a civilian Mercedes
approaches In order to give way to the vehicle the battered

group is split into two groups Many battered prisoners
suddenly mix with the Sonderkommando

Mietek starts arguing with the group’s KAPO a BALD MAN
wearing glasses

Saul looks at these weak thin men They look at the
Sonderkommando with envy

The kapos and the guards frantically start shouting

Saul with no forces left almost drowning lets the body out
of his control

He watches helplessly as the wrapped body is taken by the
waters and slowly disappears

Saul starts drowning
Frankel reaches Saul and helps him to the other side

Saul does not resist but his face is now transformed
engulfed by helplessness

CUT TO

IE WOODS BARN - DAY

Saul is pushed forward by Frankel who trails the other
fugitives in the woods

They come upon a derelict barnThe men enter
Saul is the last to enter

Feigenbaum is on the floor one of the fugitives attend to
his wound He looks battered

Some fugitives look at the scene worried
Others try to dry their clothes with straw
FEIGENBAUM
(in Yiddish)
Five minutes we have to go on

Frankel looks at Saul who stands still silent

Two men are in a heated discussion about their plans to reach
the Partisans

The entrance door is suddenly opened

The men are stirred up most of them jump up

A YOUNG BOY dressed in peasant clothes slowly enters the
room He must be 12 at most but already robust His hair is
fair and he contemplates these ragged men with uttermost

interest

The men look at him amazed

The boy takes a few steps in the room as if he were a
general in a review of his troops He curses in Polish as if

imitating his father He smiles He examines all the men
some from a close distance

He arrives near Saul and looks at him

Saul looks up at the boy The boy is now suddenly serious

Scared the boy runs out of the hut

IN THE WOODS

The boy keeps running in the woods

A sudden upheaval of voices and footsteps An SS squad passes
him by and go in the direction of the hut He is pushed onto
the ground

The soldiers quietly take position around the hut

As the soldiers besiege the hut and open fire on it the
child is frightened and runs away further deep in the woods

The camera stops We see further and further away the child
running and finally disappearing among the trees
THE END
