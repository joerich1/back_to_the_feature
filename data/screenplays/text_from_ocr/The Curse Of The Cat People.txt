THE CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE
Screen Play
by
DeWitt Bodeen

The MAIN and CREDIT TITLES are SUPERIMPOSED on a series of
line drawings of elves small forest creatures tree limbs
and other grotesqueries drawn in the delicate fanciful and
yet frightening style of Arthur Rackham The DISSOLVES from
one card to another are accomplished by a gust of wind
blowing autumnal leaves past the title as the card begins its
dissolve The drawing on the last card shows an oddly shaped
tree trunk

EXT FOREST PATH - DAY

CAMERA IS SHOOTING PAST the actual tree which we have seen
depicted in the last card Up the path marching two by two
are a dozen children of kindergarten age At their head is
Miss Callahan a young pleasant-looking teacher The
children are singing rounds and she directs this operation by
blowing a pitch pipe and extending her hand first to the left
hand column which starts the first lines of the round

CHILDREN
(singing)
The goldenrod is yellow The corn is
turning brown

Miss Callahan extends her arm toward the right column They
take up the words the left column has just finished while
the left column now goes on with the second part of the
round

CHILDREN (CONTD)
(singing)
The trees in apple orchards ‘With fruit
are bending down

Miss Callahan smiles in satisfaction at her pupils and
turning around continues along the pathway waving time with
her hands as the children go on and on with their musical
round

EXT BRIDGE CROSSING A SMALL STREAM - DAY

With Miss Callahan at their head the children march onto the
bridge Here Miss Callahan halts and the children stop with
her She turns to face them and makes a motion for them to
gather around her With them grouped about her she half
turns facing the sunny glade on the other side of the stream
MISS CALLAHAN

Take a good look children It may seen
just a little valley with a stream
running through it But no Its Sleepy
Hollow Just because you are lucky enough
to be the kindergarten class of
Tarrytown you can run and play in Sleepy
Hollow --

(glancing at her watch)
for exactly fifteen minutes

Almost with the grace of a child she rises and begins to run
As if this were a signal for them to begin their play the
children run after her

MED SHOT of children as they begin to run past the camera
laughing end shouting Finally one little girl comes
running past the camera and the CAMERA TRUCKS WITH her This
girl is Amy Reed There is a haunting quality about her
childishness almost a feeling such as Wordsworth expressed
that her youth still keeps her in touch with the memory of
another world a memory which fades with each passing day
and whose fading leaves a sense of emptiness and loss

MED CLOSE SHOT - Amy Apart from the other children she
raises her arms and looks up to the sun and the sky A
butterfly perched on a stalk of mullen attracts her
attention and she tiptoes softly toward it kneels beside
it and begins to speak to it Her voice can be heard but
the words cannot be distinguished Suddenly the butterfly
spreads its wings and flies away Amy rises with a smile and
runs after it

MED CLOSE SHOT - a stand of goldenrod in the meadow The
butterfly flies into the scene and lights on one of the
blossoms A moment later Amy comes and kneels beside it She
whispers but only a word or two can be heard

AMY
Where are you going — why do you fly
The whole wide world -- -- my friend --

youre my friend

The butterfly flutters its wings and soars into the air Amy
chases after it

MED CLOSE SHOT of several children ruthlessly pulling up the
goldenrod The butterfly goes fluttering past them Amy
her face rapt and concentrated runs past in friendly
pursuit One of the boys a stocky heavy-set youngster
named Donald looks after her and begins to run

The CAMERA DOLLIES WITH Amy as she pursues the butterfly
From behind her comes a shout

DONALDS VOICE
Ill get it for you Amy
Donald enters scene and runs past her

DONALDS VOICE (contd)
Ill get it for you Ill get it

He runs ahead of her and before she can protest snatches
off his cap and with a quick sweeping movement catches the
butterfly and presses his cap closely to him As Amy and tho
CAMERA HALT together he opens the cap with a smile puts in
his hand and brings out the torn crushed body of the
butterfly He offers it to Amy

CLOSEUP of Amy The shock and hurt have hit so deep in her
childish mind that her face is almost expressionless

TWO SHOT - Amy and Donald He still stands stupidly smiling
at her Amy makes a quick movement with her hand and slaps
him hard across the face

INT SCHOOLROOM CORRIDOR - DAY

In the long echoing corridor of the Tarrytown Public School
Amy a small and pathetic figure stands forlornly before the
closed door of a classroom From behind this door can bo
heard the murmur of adult voices deep in conversation

INT KINDERGARTEN SCHOOLROOM - DAY

A kindergarten schoolroom in one of the public schools of
Tarrytown In the room are blackboards and tacking boards on
the walls it is antiseptically clean and cheerfully light
with afternoon sunlight The little chairs and tables are
arranged in an orderly semi-circle facing the teachers desk
Grouped around this desk are Miss Callahan and Oliver and
Alice Reed

MISS CALLAHAN
(smiling and with the air of
one who tries to bring calm)
to a situation)
Really Mr Reed there isnt anything to
worry about It was only a slap --

ALICE
(brightly and trying to put
the whole discussion on a
social footing)
Thats exactly what I told Mr Reed but
he insisted upon remaining home from
business to talk to you Miss Callahan

OLIVER
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it
Miss Callahan disregards this

isnt the slap Im worried about -- its
the reason

MISS CALLAHAN
Something to do with a butterfly-- they
were quarreling about it

OLIVER
No Amy slapped Donald because he had
hurt the butterfly -- and it was her

friend

MISS CALLAHAN
Well that seems a harmless fancy --

OLIVER
(interrupting)
Amy has too many fancies -- too few
friends It worries me It doesnt seem
normal

ALICE
(apologetically to Miss
Callahan)
You know these fond fathers with their
only chicks

Olivers face

She makes
abruptly

Oliver is

MISS CALLAHAN
I can see youre worried And she is a
very sensitive and delicately adjusted
child

a slight pause as if hesitant to go on
resumes talking

MISS CALLAHAN (CONTD)

But a good deal of the blame for that may

lie with you Mr Reed Perhaps youre

over- anxious -- watch her too closely --
worry too much The childs bound to feel

it

about to answer but Amy who has been in

corridor suddenly comes into the room

AMY

Its late Mommy -- you havent forgotten

my birthday party

MISS CALLAHAN
Your birthday Amy --
(crosses the room talking) as
she goes)
-- and I have something for you in my

She looks seriously into

then

the
locker A present

AMY
Mommys having a party for me I asked
Robert and Donald and Lois --

By this time Miss Callahan has taken Amys hand and is
leading her to the door

MISS CALLAHAN
(over her shoulder)
Amy and I will meet you at the car

She takes the child out of the room Alice and Oliver follow
at a more leisurely pace

INT CORRIDOR OF THE TARRYTOWN SCHOOL - DAY

Miss Callahan and Amy go down the corridor The teacher
walks quickly and the child trots along beside her The two
parents walk along sedately Alice pausing now and again to
examine the pictures crude childish daubs displayed on the
tack-up boards Ore drawing catches her eye She stops

ALICE
Heres a drawing by Amy

Oliver goes over toward her

ALICE (CONTD)
She certainly doesnt seem to have
inherited any artistic abilities from
either of us Look at that

Oliver peers over her shoulder at the drawing

OLIVER
(grinning)
Well it shows imagination anyhow

ALICE
(turning to face him)
I wonder if you dont resent that in her

OLIVER
Im sure I dont Alice Its something
else -- something moody -- something
sickly --
(pauses)

She could almost be Irenas child
Alice studies his face for a moment

ALICE
And thats what worries you

He nods
OLIVER
Id hate her to grow up like that

ALICE
Shes not Irenas child -- theres
nothing of Irena in her Shes my ch

ild

Oliver smiling reaches over to take her hand and pat

affectionately

OLIVER

All I have to do is look at Amys eyes

blue and deep like yours

ALICE
Im not a jealous woman Oliver

OLIVER
I know that

ALICE
Thats why I can tell you straight
you think too much about Irena -- bl

yourself for her death And its you
thinking and brooding about her that
makes you so unnaturally concerned a
Amy

OLIVER
No Its not that Its because I

and cap is raking leaves into a pile The pile is already
alight and burning He is singing as he works an old sad

Dutch-English song of the district (Johnny Has Gone For a
Soldier)
EDWARD
(singing)

Who can blame me if I cry my fill Johnny
has gone for a soldier

An auto horn sounds in the street - a succession of short
squawky joyous toots Edward looks up

LONG SHOT - ANOTHER ANGLE of the street in front of the Reed
Cottage The Reed car comes down the street and draws up to

together Oliver pauses to watch the burning leaves

EDWARD
Everything all right down there at the
school Mr Reed

OLIVER
Yes everythings all right Edward

EDWARD
(shaking his head)
When I first heard all that talk about
you going down to the school to see the
teacher I got really afeard I thought
maybe you night call off this birthday
party -- and me with the cake already in
the oven

OLIVER
I imagine a child would have to commit
murder or rob the Seventh National Bank
of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday
party

He takes a final lick at the pile with the rake picks up
another implement that he has there and carrying this and the
rake he starts off around the driveway Oliver goes in at
the front door

dining room

INT DINING ROOM - REED COTTAGE - DAY

INT KITCHEN - REED COTTAGE - DAY

As Oliver comes in one door Edward comes in at the other
There is a huge birthday cake on the kitchen table Edward
takes off his cap and sweater and hangs them up in a broom
closet At tho same time he takes out a white butlers
jacket He begins to put this on and as he struggles into
the freshly starched sleeves Oliver extends his hand and
helps him to get it on

OLIVER
I thought we were going to save those
leaves you were burning for the compost
bin

EDWARD
Got more leaf mold now than well ever

up and get the yard clean

It is at this moment that Amy comes in dressed in a Kate
Greenway style party dress Edward quickly whips a tea towel
from the rack and covers the birthday cake

AMY
Is that my birthday cake May I see

OLIVER
Youll see it when its all lit and ready
for you

EDWARD

(with a glance at the clock)
You wont have long to wait In just a
few minutes this house will be
overflowing with boys and girls Off with
you now Amy Go out and watch from the
gate for all the children wholl be
coming

OLIVER
Go on -- out with you

He gives her a little shove from behind to propel her toward
the hall door With s backward look at the covered cake Amy
goes out the door Oliver and Edward stand watching her go

Oliver crosses over to the sink and runs himself a glass of
water He leans against the sink drinking it while Edward
takes up a handful of birthday candles already mounted in
their candy sconces and begins to put them into the cake
Edward suiting the action to the word half singing half
speaking but avoiding any musical comedy feeling

EDWARD
One for the one year
Then she didnt say a word
One for the two year
That was whooping cough we heard
One for the three year
She got lost then for an hour
One for the four year
She turned pretty as a flower
One for the five year
Best child I ever did see
One for the six year
I dont know what thatll be

to him

damp slightly mouldy invitations He holds them out to Amy

Well there they are
(kneels down beside Amy)
Look darling Mother and daddy keep
telling you over and over again but you

INT REED DINING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE UP of a party favor held between two hands - Olivers
and Amys The hands pull and the party favor explodes with
a loud snap

The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO show a pathetic little party in
progress Amy sits at the head of the table with Oliver and
Alice on each side of her

Almost as if the snap of the party favor were a signal for
his entrance Edward comes in from the kitchen bearing aloft
the huge birthday cake with its six shining candles and
places it before Amy

EDWARD
Youve got to blow ‘em all out in one
blow Amy

Amy prepares to blow gathering herself for the effort

OLIVER
Amy make a wish Wish real hard and
then blow out the candles and your wish
will come true

(perplexed)
But wishes dont come true

OLIVER
Certain wishes do

AMY
But you told me in the garden-- that the
wish about the tree couldnt come true

OLIVER
But this is different Go on blow

He looks at her for a second the strange inconsistency of
adult counsel to children completely lost to him

Amy blows mightily The candle flame streams out and
flickers As her breath is exhausted she inhales sharply
and the candles go out

ALICE
You get your wish

AMY
(looking at her father)
You know what I wished Daddy I wished I
could be a good girl
EDWARD
Now its all ruined you shouldnt speak
your wish

Amy looks hurt Alice comes quickly to the rescue
ALICE

But Edward in this kind of a wish that
doesnt matter

AMY

just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the
other children -- not sit around by myself —

nice pleasant world of everyday things

EXT SUBURBAN SIDEWALK - DAY

Amy lets herself out of the gate and starts skipping down the
sidewalk humming to herself She skips along sometimes
hopping on one foot as if she were playing a game of
hopscotch sometimes swinging herself diffidently around the
trunk of the tree and continuing on in the sunlight Up the
sidewalk toward her comes Jack on his tricycle Amy sees him
and stops As he passes her she calls out to him

AMY
Hello Jack

SHOT of Jack as Amy sees him He passes her on his tricycle
but turns his head and makes a face at her

MED CLOSEUP of Amy as she reacts to this new slight She is
distinctly troubled Thoughtfully she starts walking on down
the street Occasionally she turns and looks after Jack
frowning She reaches a corner where she stops for a second
pulling herself backward and forward contemplatively as she
holds on to the cornerpiece of a fence She still is looking
after Jack puzzled She shakes her head giving the problem
up and turns down the side street She stops almost
immediately her face brightening again with the anticipation
of new joy
FULL SHOT as Amy sees them of three little girls sitting on
the sidewalk playing a game of jacks One of them looks up
sees Amy motions to the others and they whisper very
briefly They all turn around look at Amy and then return
to their game of jacks devoting their entire attention to
it

MED SHOT as Amy walks down the street toward the three
little girls the CAMERA PANNING WITH her She stops when she
reaches the three children They do not look up but go on
with their game as if it were the only thing taking place in
life Evelyn the little girl whose turn it is makes a grand
final play throwing the ball catching up eight jacks
knocking with her forefinger knuckle on the pavement and
catching the ball

EVELYN
What comes next

LUCILE
Double knocks of course

Evelyn starts on double knocks but misses almost at once
EVELYN
I just seem to stay in double knocks
forever
She passes the ball on to Lucile observing as she does so
EVELYN (COND)
Of course its very hard to do anything

with somebody breathing down your neck

LUCILE
What was I In

DOROTHY
You were in threes of over the fence

LUCILE
Oh yes

She starts to do threes in over the fence but misses at
once She looks in exasperation at her two companions

Simultaneously all three little girls turn and glare at Amy

REVERSE SHOT of the three little girls in the fg Amy in
the bg takes a step forward

AMY
May I play too

DOROTHY
Why dont you go home

AMY
Im a good player

LUCILE
You might just as well stop being nice to
us Amy Reed Were mad at you

AMY
Why

LUCILE
Because you said you were going to invite
us to your birthday party

EVELYN
And you didnt

AMY
But I did I did invite you

The three little girls simply look at Amy to them she is a
complete liar They put their heads together and whisper One
of them giggles Dorothy looks up and points down the street
behind Amy

DOROTHY
Look at the giraffe

Amy turns her head and the minute she turns around the three
little girls scramble to their feet and with screams of
laughter start running down the street Amy turns around
puzzled and then starts after the children The three little
girls can be heard screaming to one another

GIRLS
Run
Run faster
Ditch her

AMY
I invited you to my party I did I did
I did

SHOT of the three little girls running They turn the corner
Amy can bo seen running up to the corner still shouting

did I did

She finally gets to the corner still running and makes the
same turn the other children did

EXT FARREN HOUSE and GARDENS - DAY
A late Victorian house with gables and cupolas and a wide

piazza stands on the fringe of the forest It is overgrown
with ivy morning glories and wild honeysuckle The yard
too which had once been a formal garden is a tangle of wild
growth The house is silent no sign of life about it A
very low crumbling and in some places completely broken
iron rail sets the garden off from the dirt pathway There
are ornate statues in the garden and in front of the
entrance is an old elaborate carriage post The children
come running into the scene screaming and laughing

CHILDREN
(ad lib)
We ditched her
Serves her right

CLOSER SHOT of the children Suddenly they notice where they
are and they immediately grow more quiet Their whispers can
be heard as they go past on tiptoe

CHILDREN
(ad lib)
The old house
Theres a witch in it
Its haunted
Count three count four
Run past the door
Thats the best thing to say for witches

LONGER SHOT of the children as they near the other end of the
fence Their courage suddenly leaves them and they all make
a frantic run for it

SHOT of Amy as she comes up to the old house She is out of
breath and quite evidently her playmates have gotten out of
her sight She looks with interest at the strange house and
the overgrown garden She stands gazing about her A voice
from an upper window begins to call her The voice is sweet
professionally trained and full of enticement

VOICE
Little girl Little girl Come into the
garden Its pleasant and cool here --
ever so pleasant -- ever so cool out of
the hot sun --

Amy is fascinated She looks up and still looking up slowly
and hesitantly begins to go into the garden She passes under
the pergola and peers at the frightening heraldic lion in the
bushes With an occasional glance in the direction of the
voice which still can be heard calling she goes on to the
path and approaches the sculptured figure of Comedy On the
porch steps from above her the voice calls

VOICE
Little girl step back away from the
house so that I can see you Step back
little girl

Amy looks puzzled but to get a better view she takes one or
two natural steps backward looking up

CLOSE UP of an open window A gentle breeze is blowing the
lace curtains Through the opening between the curtains a
womans gnarled hand appears in a velvet sleeve This hand
holds a handkerchief weighted at one corner and tosses the
handkerchief out the window

EXT FARREN GARDENS -- DAY

Amy watches as the handkerchief flutters down She makes a
futile effort to catch it It falls near her She picks it
up and examines it

INSERT AMYS HANDS as she holds up the handkerchief
One corner of it has been drawn through a silver ring She
removes the ring and tries it first on one finger and then
another It fits her thumb

MED CLOSE SHOT of Amy She puts the ring on her thumb and
stands a moment holding the handkerchief up between her two
hands Suddenly and silently from behind a bush beside her a
thin white arm and hand appears The hand grasps the
handkerchief

TWO SHOT of Miss Barbara Farren cadaverously tall and thin
with only her bright hair to speak of a beauty which is
quickly fading as she steps out into the sunlight from
behind the bush As she does so she tears the handkerchief
from Amys hands Amy stunned and silent relinquishes the
handkerchief and watches while Barbara Farren paces stately
across the garden and around the corner into the house From
above her the voice can be heard calling

VOICE
Go away little girl Go away

Amy looks up and starts to move away At first she walks
slowly with many and backward glance but upon reaching the
protective shadows of the pergola she breaks into a run

INT REED KITCHEN - DAY

Edward wearing a blue and white striped denim apron has a
fat roasting chicken on the table and is dexterously
proceeding to stuff and truss it As he works he solemnly
addresses the fowl

EDWARD
Oh you were a lordly fellow handsome as
a king and full of pride Struttin and
showin off and scratchin up the earth
and callin all the hens to account for
this and that

He pats in a bit of stuffing

EDWARD (CONTD)
A lordly fellow -- a lordly fellow -- and
now you lie on your back with your legs
in the air and you dont even know what
the score is -- no sir you dont even
know what the score is

Amy comes in from the back yard She is hot and breathless
as if she had been running Edward takes a look at her anda
quick look at the kitchen clock He leaves his former
companion lying on the table and crosses to the icebox

EDWARD (CONTD)
Guess youll be wanting a glass of milk
Amy

She nods He opens the icebox door and takes out a glass of
milk which has been standing waiting covered with a saucer
As Amy takes the glass with her right hand she holds up her
left thumb

AMY
Look at my ring

EDWARD
Thats a fine-looking ring

AMY
A lady threw it to me

EDWARD
Most surely that was a nice lady to give
a ring to a little girl

AMY
Its a pretty ring

EDWARD
I wouldnt be surprised if it were a true
wishing ring

Amy looks at it

AMY
A ring that I can wish on like I wished
on the candles

EDWARD
Maybe if its a real mourning ring like
we have in Jamaica All you got to do is
turn it on your finger close your eyes
and make a wish
AMY
(holding) the ring up to him)
Whats a mourning ring

EDWARD
Theyre given to the living in memory of
the dead If this is a real one -- I
cant be sure -- you can make a wish and
it will come true in the twinkling of an
eye

AMY

Well if its a real mourning ring Im
going to think hard for something I want
more than anything else in the world
before I wish

EDWARD
Thats the clever way to do it

Edward looks at her appraisingly

EDWARD (contd)
You look good and hot and good and tired
Guess youve been playing real hard with
your friends

AMY
I didnt play Edward They wouldnt
play with me

Edward looks up in concern and Amy hastens to bury her face
in the glass of milk

EDWARD

Your daddy isnt going to like that He
ad his heart set on your playing with
the other kids

He shakes his head uttering a clucking sound of disapproval
Amy takes her face out of tho glass long enough to say

AMY
(thoughtfully)
Id better tell him

She drinks the remainder of her milk thinks a moment and
evidently feels it better to get the worst over right away

She starts toward the door

INT OLIVER REEDS WORKSHOP - DAY

This is a pleasant many-windowed room with a neat array of
shelves nail bins work benches and small power tools
Oliver in an old sweater flannel trousers and moccasins
is working on a ship model It is a planked model of the
Half Moon Oliver very carefully fits a plank and drives
in two brads to hold it Amy comes in and stands watching
until he has finished

OLIVER
Your daddys so pleased with you hes
building a model ship for your very own
Come take a look at it

He takes her by the hand to show her the model on the bench
Amy looks at it but she is not particularly happy Her
fathers kindness makes it all the more difficult for her to
tell him what she has to say

OLIVER (CONTD)
You see when you are a good girl and
play with other children instead of
moping and dreaming by yourself your
daddy wants to do everything he can to
make you happy

This has not helped Amy any She stands still staring at
him wondering how to begin

OLIVER (contd)
How you run along and join your
playmates

Turning away from her he turns on the electric saw Amy
still stands watching him He is about to feed a piece of
wood to the saw when she finally summons up courage enough
to tug at his sleeve

AMY
Daddy --

Oliver looks at her and tries to hear what she is saying but
cannot because of the noise of the machinery With an
impatient gesture he turns it off

OLIVER
What do you want Amy

AMY
I wanted to talk to you I wanted to
tell you about the other children

OLIVER
Cant you tell me later

AMY
But I didnt play with them Daddy They
wouldnt play with me

Oliver is annoyed at having been interrupted and further
angered by the fact that he had jumped to his own conclusion
of the childs goodness He sits down on a little stool to
bring himself on the same level with the child

OLIVER
What do you mean you didnt play with the
other children

AMY
It was on account of the birthday party

OLIVER
Because you didnt ask them I dont
blame them for being angry Why didnt
you explain what happened

AMY
They ran away

OLIVER
Why didnt you run after them

AMY
I did I came to an old dark house and
a voice called to me -- a lovely sweet

voice ---

Oliver cocks his head apprehensively

OLIVER
Now Amy

AMY
Its true

OLIVER

And who did the voice belong to

AMY
It was just a voice

OLIVER
(completely angry)
Now look this is the last time you come
to me with any such stories — Im sick of
this sort of thing

AMY
Daddy its true

OLIVER
Let me be the judge of that

His voice has been rising As Amy starts to steal out of the
workshop into the yard Alice dressed for gardening pokes
her head in at the open doorway

ALICE
(trying to pour oil on the
troubled waters)
My my what a coil were in Whats this
all about

OLIVER
Amys been lying again

AMY
No I didnt

OLIVER
(scornfully)
Voices from an old dark house

ALICE
Did you hear the child out

OLIVER
Well it seemed to me --

ALICE
You mean you didnt It seems to me the
least you could do You cant just jump
at conclusions that way Youre being
unfair

OLIVER
Im never unfair

ALICE
(almost tearfully)
Youre shouting at me

OLIVER
(roaring)
Im not shouting at you but theres no
doubt in my mind that you spoil this
child

Amy who has been listening intently shrinking away with
mingled embarrassment and hurt suddenly begins to cry
Oliver is the first to kneel beside her

OLIVER (CONTD)
Im sorry Daddy and Mommy are a little
upset

AMY
Youre upset about me -- I made you fight
--I hate for you to fight

ALICE
Were not really fighting darling -- just
a little argument You run out and play --
go on now -- Well make up

She shoos the child out of the door
EXT REED YARD -- DAY

Amy still dabbing at her eyes comes a few feet out of the
workshop door and turns back to look at her parents In the
background Alice is dabbing at her eyes with her
handkerchief but she is smiling Amy starts down the path
Edward trundling a wheelbarrow toward the front yard passes
her notices the tears and stops

EDWARD
Been crying That wont please your
Daddy Youd bettor cheer yourself up

AMY
Im trying to

EDWARD
(remembering)
Let me take another look at that ring

She lifts it up and he looks at it

EDWARD
Sure enough thats a real mourning ring
and its got wishing power Youd better
sit down and think of some good wishes to
make

Edward with a kindly pat on her shoulder picks up his
wheelbarrow and starts off Amy looks after him absorbed
Then she turns

ANOTHER ANGLE Amy ambles along the walk In one hand she
carries the hoop and stick Idly she kicks up and pebble with
the toe of her shoe As she passes a bush she tears off a
leaf and chews on it She reaches a snail pond and drops
down beside it with a sigh Amy locks down into the pond

INSERT THE SURFACE OF THE POND A large goldfish is
lazily swimming around

BACK TO SCENE Amy smiles and leans over tho pond She puts
one hand in the water and ripples the surface Then staring
at her hand she stops fascinated

CLOSE UP of Amys hand under the surface of the water The
silver ring glistens brightly

Amy draws her hand out of the water and stares at the ring A
smile lightens her face She knows now what she will wish
for She sits down on a large rock closes her eyes and
firmly turns the ring on her finger as she makes her wish

AMY
I wish for a friend
For a second she remains with her eyes closed then slowly
she opens her eyes looks about her

EXT THE WOODS -- DAY

LONG SHOT The trees stand still and quiet At first no
breeze rustles the leaves the yaddo lying on the lawn is
motionless Then a whisper of a breeze moves the branches of
the trees and the yaddo flutters gently coming to life

EXT REED YARD - DAY

Amy is standing up and looking with anticipation at the
moving sunlight and shadow

Through the picket fence on the fringe of the woods a
cluster of dandelions grow The breeze blows the dandelions
and they incline their tufted heads toward the yard The
little spears of dandelion fluff are loosened in the air and
enter the yard sailing on the wind The musical motif of
Irenas song sounds faintly growing stronger

Amy looks about her as the dandelion tufts come dancing by
her

She laughs happily and in the moving sunlight and shadow
begins to roll her hoop Irenas song which fills the track
is gay and happy

INT OLIVER REEDS WORKSHOP - DAY

Oliver is at his handsaw He is feeding a long thin strip of
wood into the saw and Edward stands behind him holding up the
other end of the stick Ho has on a carpenters apron
Through the window Amy can be seen playing happily racing
along the path

The saw cuts to the end of the stick and Oliver turns it off
Both men look out of the window

EDWARD
Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she
were playing with another child like
somebody else were running with her and
playing

OLIVER

(simply)

I like to see her happy

EDWARD
So do I Mr Reed

Oliver reaches over for the next stick of wood to cut The
two men take their positions at the saw Oliver turns it on

down at the empty plates

OLIVER

OLIVER
Thats because she made a promise and

You saw the way she played this
afternoon Edward

EDWARD
Indeed I did Up and down the garden she
went laughing and singing to herself

Alice comes in and stands watching smiling

AMY
I wasnt singing to myself

EDWARD
Oh I suppose it was to the wind you
sang or maybe to the sun or the clouds
or maybe it was to the flowers in the
garden

Oliver goes to the sink to wash his hands Amy puts aside her
dish and spoon wipes her mouth with her napkin and climbs

down from her chair

AMY
All through

Her mother takes her hand and they start out of the kitchen

INT REED LOWER HALLWAY AND STAIRS - NIGHT
Amy walks along the hallway holding Alices hand She is
humming a song

ALICE
(turning to her)
What are saying darling

AMY

ALICE
I suppose any note no matter how sour
is a song if you hold on to it long
enough

Amy frowns pursing her lips and shaking her head

AMY
I thought Id never forget that song

They have reached the stairs and start up

ALICE
What song dear

AMY
The song I was trying to hum The song my
friend taught me
ALICE

Oh youll remember it some time

They go on up the stairs and into Amys room

INT AMYS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Alice comes into the room with Amy and switches on the light
while Amy pulls off her bathrobe On the dressing table is a
small basin of water and a wash cloth Amy stands patiently
while Alice dabs at her face with a soaped cloth

ALICE
Oh lots of times

INT REED LIVING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE SHOT of one of Olivers model sailing craft the sails
flutter and stir as if it were sailing before a strong
breeze Over this shot is the sound of Edwards voice
singing Blow The Man Down

The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO show him working with a vacuum
cleaner blowing the dust from the model Suddenly there is a
click The wind that filled the model sails dies abruptly
leaving them flat and becalmed Edward turns to look at the
body of the vacuum cleaner which lies on the floor Amy is
kneeling beside it She has a shy smile on her face It was
she who had turned it off

EDWARD

her knees her chin in her hands and watches him patiently
Suddenly she flicks off the switch again The vacuum cleaner
stops

EDWARD (contd)
(protestingly)

EDWARD

I do suppose so But if you were there

thoughts — things they love

As she finishes speaking the two women come abreast of the
Goya painting of the three cats with their mad staring eyes

ALICE

Miss Callahan shakes her head

ALICE (CONTD)
But it is a part of our lives too --a
part of our past Its a Goya
reproduction Those three cats --
(points)

drawn cats in Western art

MISS CALLAHAN
But you dont keep a cat do you

Ive often thought of giving it away but
Oliver wouldnt stand for it It was his
first wifes favorite picture She was
an artist

MISS CALLAHAN

ALICE
Yes As a matter of fact I was on the
point of telling you about it yesterday —

Amy with the serious mien of one intent upon an errand
comes down the street and turns in at the pergola of the

Farren home

EXT FARREN HOUSE -- DAY

Amy crosses from the pergola to the porch She climbs the
steps knocks and waits a moment The door opens and Miss
Farren stands there

AMY
Can I see the lady who gave me this ring

She holds up the ring Without a word Miss Farren lets the
child pass in and closes the door behind her

INT HALL -- FARREN HOUSE -- DAY

The great heavy draperies of this room are drawn As the
door closes behind Amy the twilight of this somber ante
chamber closes around the child The weird ornaments the
rococo furniture the angular stairway loom darkly around
her In front of her tall and pale stands Barbara Farren

BARBARA
What is it

AMY
My mother told me to give back the ring
to the lady who gave it to me
Barbara stretches out her hand Amy shakes her head

AMY (contd)
Youre not the lady
Barbara points to a tall high-backed chair

BARBARA
Sit there

Frightened and keeping her eyes on Barbara Amy hoists
herself up into the chair Without a word Barbara turns and
goes out The child looks around She glances at the sphinxes
that guard tho stairway and the grinning statue of a Negro
serving maid She tries to see beyond into tho darkened
living room She moves trying to find a more comfortable
position in this stiff high chair

EXT REED FRONT YARD -- DAY

Edward is gardening At least he has on his gardening
outfit the brown sweater and cap and he has a pair of
pruning shears in his hand but at the moment he has stopped
to survey Miss Callahans bicycle His inspection of this
vehicle has brought him to the books and he leans against the
bicycle reading from one of the books

INT HALLWAY - REED HOME - DAY

Alice and Miss Callahan are coming out of the dining room
into the hall

ALICE
(as if continuing a
conversation)
Its almost as if there were a curse on
us I wouldnt care if it were on me but
it seems to be directed against the
child Irena haunts this house

Alice starts to open the door

EXT REED FRONT YARD - DAY

Alice opens the door and she and Miss Callahan step through
Edward puts the book back into the basket on the bicycle

ALICE
(to Edward)

house she was talkin about yesterday

ALICE
Thats the Farren house

EDWARD

ALICE
But I told her to go with you

EDWARD
She said something about that Mrs Reed
— but she didnt tell me it was the
Farren house Ill get my other hat and
coat and go over there

ALICE
You do that Edward

He starts out for the side driveway and goes around the
corner of the house

MISS CALLAHAN
(wheeling her bicycle around)
That the old actress -- Julia Farren

ALICE
Yes Shes a little odd I understand

MISS CALLAHAN
But quite harmless Im sure

Miss Callahan wheels her bicycle down the drive eases it off
the curb and prepares to mount She waves Alice waves
back

INT FARREN HALLWAY - DAY

Amy is sitting a tiny figure in the big chair She looks
around her The hallway is still silent She slips the ring
on her finger and then slides down off the chair and starts
toward the door A slight rustling sound attracts her
attention and she turns

The entrance to the drawing room as Amy sees it A portiere
like curtain separates the drawing room from the hallway
Inside the drawing room in the half-light are weird shadows

Amy timidly steps forward to the drawing room She reaches
the curtain gently pushes it aside and steps within the

room

INT FARREN DRAWING ROOM -- DAY

The drawing room like the hallway is deep with shadows The
drawing room is cluttered with useless Victorian and
Edwardian antiques Amy moves slowly into the room her
attention going from one baroque object to another On a
small mahogany table there is a glassed dome enclosing a
stuffed dove that flutters over a mossy column of artificial
forget-me-nots A low cackling laughter sounds os
Startled Amy looks up
A corner of the room In the dim light the furniture throws
large shadows An amused cackling laughter is heard

Amy frightened listens a moment The laughter ceases Amy
takes a step toward the hallway Suddenly there is a sharp
quick rattling sound and sunlight floods the scene Amy
cowers hiding her eyes from the bright light

Julia Farren stands at the window one hand still resting on
the center rod of the old-fashioned shutter through which
bright sunlight now pours Mrs Farren is a fabulous
creature Her face is painted rouged and powdered and she
wears a thick wig of outrageously red hair There are jeweled
pendants glittering in her ears rings on her fingers
bracelets on her wrists She wears a diamond necklace and
around her throat is a grosgrain ribbon with a huge ruby
shining in the center Her gown is of the period 1915 and
was once a very elaborate Worth model It is a tea gown of
gold lace over velvet but some of the panels of lace are
torn and sagging She leans on a black walking stick that has
a diamond top Her scarlet lips open in a smile as she looks
down at Amy

Amy slowly lets her hands fall from her face and stares up
at Julia Farren blinking her eyes in the unaccustomed light
Julia Farren adjusts the rod on the shutter so that the light
is softer and no longer glaring She smiles at Amy

MRS FARREN
I agree with you God should use a rose
amber spot The sun is not kind

Mrs Farren moves a few steps to her chair and sits down in
it as if it were a throne With a wide flourish of one hand
she indicates the sofa across from her

MRS FARREN (contd)
Sit down my child

Amy moves to the sofa and slides up onto it A large white
cat leaps onto the lap of Mrs Farren who caresses it
gently Amy is unable to take her eyes from the fabulous
woman before her Mrs Farren smiles a glittering smile

MRS FARREN (CONTD)
Ive been watching you You couldnt see
me but I could see you It was like
peeking through a slit in the curtain
before the play began You would be a
very good audience I can see that

AMY
If you were the lady who gave me a ring
my mother says I have to give it back to
you

MRS FARREN
Return it to me Indeed you may not I
gave it to you as a present

AMY
But my mother says I mustnt accept
gifts from strangers

MRS FARREN
Stranger Julia Farren a stranger
Why Ive played every theatre from
Boston to San Francisco Ive been
to London and Paris Those days —
those beautiful shilling golden

days

AMY
But I only came to give back the
ring

MRS FARREN
The ring Well have no more
nonsense about the ring

She turns to the tea-table upon which a silver teapot cups
and tea-things are laid

MRS FARREN (CONTD)
Lets have tea shall we The tea
will be good and strong and red now
— the way I like it

She starts to pour but there is a light sound of footsteps
in the hall Mrs Farren looks around Her whole body seems
to freeze An icy hateful gleam comes into her eyes Amy

looks at Mrs Farren then apprehensively glances around

Barbara Farren stands in the doorway staring at her mother
Barbara is a woman of around thirty-five tall blonde
beautiful Her eyes lynx-like glint as she stares she
looks as if she might pounce like a panther into the room
Her lip curls with faint contempt and turning she quits the
room

Mrs Farren looks at Amy

MRS FARREN (CONTD)
Shes always spying on me She
creeps into the room She lives
upstairs yet shes always watching
me — always

AMY
Who is she

MRS FARREN
That woman is an imposter a liar
and a cheat How do you like
your tea
AMY
Well sometimes I got a spoonful of
tea in a cup of hot milk

Mrs Farren hands the teacup to Amy

MRS FARREN
There you are Take some cake why dont
you

AMY
No thank you

MRS FARREN
One little piece of cake wont hurt you
Go ahead take one Its full of

fruitcitron cherries and ginger
Itll make you dream Yes wonderful
dreams

Obediently Amy takes a piece of cake and munches on it Mrs
Farren is stirring her tea Suddenly she puts her teacup
down and leans forward with new interest to the child

MRS FARREN
Child have you ever seen a play

Amy shakes her head

AMY
I like stories

MRS FARREN
Then Ill tell you a story — a lovely
story Do you know the story of Rapunzel

AMY
Mommy read it to ne

MRS FARREN
Do you know the story of The Headless
Horseman
Amy shakes her head
MRS FARREN (contd)
You live right here in Tarrytown and
dont know the legend of Sleepy Hollow

Amy shakes her head again

MRS FARREN (CONTD)
Well then you must hear it I shall tell
it to you

Amy claps her hands together gleefully Mrs Farren gets up
takes Amy by the hand and leads her to a little chair which
she places at the entrance of the alcove off of the living
room

MRS FARREN
You sit here and well pretend thats a
stage

She starts toward the alcove

MRS FARREN
(as she walks)
The Headless Horseman --

AMY
Why hasnt he got a head

MRS FARREN
It was shot off long ago in the great
battles that were fought here with the
British on one side and the Americans on
the other

She has reached the alcove and draws the curtains a little
and stands in the arch-way turning to face the child

MRS FARREN (CONTD)
At night the Headless Horseman rides

There is a banging on the outer door and she stops abruptly
Both she and the child look off at the door

MRS FARREN (contd)
I hear a knocking at the South entry
Knock knock knock --- never at quiet
Wake Duncan with thy knocking --- I would
thy couldst

INT FARREN HALLWAY - DAY

With light graceful steps Barbara Farren crosses the hall
and opens the door Edward stands there hat in hand

EDWARD
Is my little miss here -- A little girl
with hair about the color of yours

maam
Without a word Barbara steps back to let him in He comes
forward hesitantly With a white hand she points toward the

living room

INT FARREN LIVING- ROOM - DAY

Edward comes in Mrs Farren and Amy have gone halfway
the room to meet him

EDWARD
About time for you to come home Amy

AMY
But Mrs Farren just started to tell me a
story Please

MRS FARREN
(imperiously)
Let the child stay

EDWARD
(beginning to hesitate)
Now I dont know Amy --

AMY
(quick to take advantage)
Hell let me stay Mrs Farren Hell let
me stay

MRS FARREN
Good

She starts back to her impromptu stage
EDWARD

(protesting)
Now Amy I didnt say --

down

Amy is already engrossed in the idea of the performance to
come She takes her seat again Edward is forced to fellow

her and stands beside her Before he can resume his
protestations Mrs Farren begins her recital

MRS FARREN
On the dark nights — on the stormy nights
-- you can hear him He passes like the
wind The flapping and fluttering of his
great cloak beating like gaunt wings The
thunder of his horses hooves is loud
loud and louder beating hard beating
strong on the frozen ground as he comes
riding riding riding

EDWARD
(whispering)
Little miss you cant stay here Youve
got to come with me

Edward tries to take Amys hand but she puts her fingers to

her lips shushing him

MRS FARREN
-At the hour of midnight down the road
that goes through Sleepy Hollow across
the bridge he goes galloping galloping
always searching always seeking

EDWARD
Come away Amy

The child is too engrossed to even hear him hanging on every
word of the old ladys recital

MRS FARREN
-- If you stand on that bridge at the
wrong hour -- the hour when he rides by
his great cloak sweeps around you he
swings you to his saddle bow and you
have to ride forever your eyes seeing for
his blind eyes your ears listening for
his ears long deafened and dead and
always his cold arms around you crushing
you into the cavity of his bony chest
Then forever you must ride and ride and
ride with the Headless Horseman

Amy shudders Mrs Farren is delighted with the effect on the
child All her emotions spent on the narrative she goes back
to her chair picks up her tea cup and sips

MRS FARREN (contd)
My tea has gone cold -- bitter cold

EDWARD
Come along now

He takes Amys hand and starts out of the living room The
old lady pays no attention to their departure At the door
Amy turns back

AMY
Ive had a nice time but I have to go
home now Good-bye

Mrs Farren pays no attention

AMY
Good-bye

Edward has succeeded in getting her to the hall door and they
go out into the hall

INT FARREN HALLWAY - DAY

Amy and Edward come out of the living room and go down the
hallway to the front door Edward fusses with the numerous
bolts and chains which hold this structure closed Suddenly
two slender white hands come into the scene and with a
single twist effortlessly unbolt the door Amy and Edward
look around
Barbara Farren as Amy sees her There is no expression on
her face yet her eyes glint mysteriously as she looks down
at the child

Barbara Farren opens the door Amy looks at her and smiles

AMY
Thank you

She goes outside and Barbara Farren closes the door after
her and Edward She turns back and starts toward the living
room

OMITTED
INT PERGOLA - FARREN HOUSE - DAY

Edward holding Amys hand comes halfway down the length of
the pergola and leans over to talk at the same level as the
child He talks in a low voice

EDWARD
Little miss dont you never come here
alone You gave me a fright you did

AMY
But shes such a nice lady

EDWARD
But I dont want you coming here alone
You get me to go with you when you want

to come here You promise

The child nods solemnly without understanding He wags his
finger before her

EDWARD (contd)
You be sure of your promise

Amy nods again

INT FARREN LIVING ROOM - DAY

Barbara Farren enters and stands in front of her mother She
stands silently for a moment then in a tone of terrible and
suppressed bitterness she speaks

BARBARA
A liar -- an impostor -- your own
daughter You call me that and yet you
are sweet and kind to the little girl --
a stranger --

The old lady doesnt even look up

BARBARA (CONTD)
Look at me Im your daughter
Without lifting her head the old woman replies

MRS FARREN

My daughter Barbara died when she was
six That was long ago Youre only the
woman who keeps care of me I know you

BARBARA
Look at me

The old woman keeps her eyes fixed on the carpet Barbara
reaches down and firmly takes her mothers chin in her hand
drawing her face up The old woman despite the fact that she
is forced to face her daughter averts her eyes

MRS FARREN
Youre an impostor

Barbara drops the old womans chin turns and silently leaves
the room

INT AMYS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Amy is in bed asleep Moonlight fills the room Amy lies
perfectly still in quiet sleep her hair tousled on the white
pillow At the window a branch of a tree is beating its
leaves against the panes of class In the distance muffled
and faint issuing from no known direction comes the beat of
horses hoofs Mrs Farrens voice can be heard

MRS FARRENS VOICE
He comes riding riding riding On the
dark nights-- on the nights of storm

The words are repeated in and out of sequence a mad and
irritating cacophony of verbiage

In the darkness of the window against the background of
beating boughs great hooves appear striking at the air
bright shoes flash the calks catching the light The hairy
fetlocks are dank and wet The chest of the horse his
flaring nostrils the wildly rolling eyes the mane wind
tossed and merging with the agitated branches of the tree
come into terrifying CLOSE UP Then suddenly the Headless
Horseman in Hussar uniform the braid white and ghastly
stretched across the darkness of his uniform comes into
view Crooked in bias arm is his dead head surmounted by a
Hussars cap The eyes are closed and drooping The cheeks
hang putrescent and flabby Only the spiked mustaches are
upright and give the lie to death Around this horse and
figure whips the great black cloak One fold of it swoops
across the face of the sleeping child and she wakens sits up
in bed and screams

INT AMYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Amy is huddled in bed badly frightened There is only the
pitiful sighing sound of the branch of the tree outside
swaying in the wind Amy clutching her hands together looks
down and spies the ring on one finger She turns the ring
whispering

AMY
My friend Im frightened

FULL SHOT of Amys window The soft curtains billow out far
into the room In the moonlight the leafy branches of the
trees seem to dance throwing shadows into the room The
shadows dance across to Amys bed the CAMERA FOLLOWING them

Amy smiles and settles down under the covers Her eyes are
heavy with sleep

AMY
(softly)
Im glad you camemy friend sing me
that song again

Her eyes close in sleep and as she nestles her head back
against the shadow the shadow gains the vague gray outline
of a womans figure holding the sleeping child against her
breast Very softly a womans voice sings the old French
lullaby In her sleep Amy smiles in contentment

INT REED LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The four people are still playing cards Olivers attention

there

Oliver nods and sits down on the arm of the chair He starts
to turn the photos over

ALICE
Some day Im afraid were going to have
to tell her about Irena

OLIVER
I suppose so

Over the scene from outside sounds the gay childish
laughter of Amy Oliver raises his head and listens for a
second He then begins sorting the photos

EXT REED GARDEN - DAY

As Amy walks along the garden path she is bouncing a large
gaily-colored ball She is bouncing it at first in an aimless
sort of way then she throws it up into the air and catcher
it Over the scene comes the strain of Irenas song and
Amy with the ball in hand looks up Her eyes brighten with
a curious interest and her lips part in a friendly smile
She tosses the ball toward the camera After a second it
comes back to her This time the CAMERA TRAVELS WITH the ball
to show Amys friend who catches the ball and tosses it back
to Amy Amys friend is a woman in gray chiffon garments
This is the first-complete materialization of the friend and
it is evident that she has the pretty kitten-like face of
Irena Olivers first wife

that Alice is in the dining room and has her back to him He
weighs the photograph a moment in his hands and looks up at
the bookshelves near by There is a thick photo album on one
of the top shelves

Quickly he inserts the photograph between its leaves He
moves away from the bookshelf as Alice re-enters the room
She looks at him and then at the fireplace

The last part of the last picture that was thrown into the

It stands so still

IRENA
Because it knows it can move with the
swiftness of strong wind

Its a warm breath -- warm and strong —
warmed by the sunlight that shone on the
deers back in the hot summer sweet with
leaves and mosses

AMY
May I pet the deer

IRENA
It is wildness and freedom No one can
touch it

I want to touch it

tosses it carelessly onto the table and fits the new ring to
her finger

Listen There it is again Its the horn of Herne the
Huntsman

AMY
Whos Herne the Huntsman

MRS FARREN
Dont you read Shakespeare
Amy shakes her head

MRS FARREN
(eyes shining rising)
There is an old tale goes that Herne
the hunter Sometimes a keeper here in
Windsor forest Doth all the winter time
at still midnight Walk round about an
oak with great raggd horns And there
e blasts the trees (with a sigh)
Ah well its a bad generation --
forgetting all the beautiful words Ill
tell you plainly -- theres a wild
untsman who scours the forest with his
dogs and his men He winds his horn and
the woods echo with it Everywhere he
passes the animals are slaughtered and
lie dead beneath his trampling feet If
e should catch up with anyone walking in
the wood forever and forever they would
ave to hunt with Herne the Huntsman and
is wild rout Hear his horn

The question is addressed to both persons Amy nods and
Edward shakes his head

AMY
And does he kill people

MRS FARREN
No not people -- just deer and game but
the people he catches can never be free
again They too must kill and kill
covering themselves with blood

Edward getting alarmed by now decides that the visit has
lasted long enough He looks toward the shuttered windows

EDWARD
Its dark Wed better be getting on The
family will be waiting

Such a brief visit but dear child it
has made my Christmas very merry

She takes Amys little hands and presses them against her
withered cheek tenderly From the doorway Barbara watches
bitten deep with jealousy and hurt

starts to lead her from the

Very slowly holding onto the banister Mrs Farren starts
ascending the stairs Barbara stands watching her

EXT ROAD - DUSK

Early winter darkness is in the air It is not snowing but a
wind is blowing rustling the garments of Edward and Amy who
walk down the road The colored man is leading Amy by one
hand in his other hand is a pocket flash which he now turns
on The ray of the flashlight cuts through the darkness the
beam falling upon the snowy road Suddenly Edward stops
short staring down before him

The CAMERA PANS ALONG the ray to where it discloses lying
upon the snow in a pool of blood the mangled body of the
little deer

Edward quickly tries to hide the pathetic sight of the dead
deer from Amys eyes by switching the flashlight off the
object and by putting an arm around the child shielding her
from viewing the carcass

EDWARD
Mustnt look little miss Mustnt look

AMY
But I saw what it was Its the little
deer

Edward has passed by the deer and is walking along more
rapidly now with Amy

EDWARD
Bad luck to see death in the snow

AMY
But what happened to the little deer
EDWARD
Probably hit by a car Hard to see things
in the twilight

AMY
Why is it just lying there Why doesnt
it get up

EDWARD

Because it cant Its dead
AMY
But it was alive — it was fast and

strong

EDWARD
It got hit

AMY
But where has it gone Wheres all the

strength and the quickness

Edward cannot answer the childs question so he makes a
secret of it He raises his finger to his lips He shrugs

AMY
(pondering a moment)

Ill ask my friend Shell know

Amy immediately dismisses the whole project from her mind and
walks along with Edward

she has offended her father She has no way however of
knowing the reason for that offense Alice has come over and
is staring down at the picture which she has taken from
Oliver Oliver kneels down so that his eyes are on a level
with Amys

OLIVER (CONTD)

Olivers and Amys Alice raises her eyes upward and sits
listening Miss Callahan listens a second then continues in
an effort to be doubly gay

MISS CALLAHAN (CONTD)
We were such a large family that I
remember one Twelfth Night there was no
pine branch left for me to wish upon but
my brother who was nearest me said
Dont you worry Ill wish for both of
us

The voice upstairs reaches a climax in its anger Miss
Callahan cannot continue to feign joy Alice looks upstairs

bitterly

ALICE
Forgive me but it was superstition
foolish childish wishesthat
started all this

MISS CALLAHAN
What do you mean

ALICE
I can see it allthe very day it began
Amy was lonely she was desperate for
friendship I remember the night she told
me she had wished on her ring That must
have been the day she first wished for a
friend

MISS CALLAHAN
Its perfectly normal for a child
to dream I can see how a sensitive
little girl finding this portrait would
take the image of this woman and make of
her an imaginary friend That image
dwells only in her imagination and that
image can go as quickly as it was born

ALICE
How

MISS CALLAHAN

(quietly)
Once the emptiness in Amys life is
filled the dream will go of itself If a
up to you both of you Only you two can
bring her into a real world You must
give her the friendship and love she
craves

OLIVER
But we have Shes wanted for nothing

MISS CALLAHAN
Perhaps shes wanted for understanding

Miss Callahans words silence Oliver He looks from her to

of Amys shoes as she plows her way through the heavy snow
She looks from side to side as she walks along

CLOSEUP of Amys face as she walks along looking from left
to right Suddenly she looks ahead and stops abruptly

The snail bridge that crosses the frozen stream as Amy sees
it The bridge is blanketed with snow and is illumined by the
full glare of the cold moonlight

CLOSEUP of Amys face as she looks at the bridge Over the

Amy swallows hard and then steps forward onto the bridge

The CAMERA PANS WITH her as she walks along About the time
she has reached the halfway point in her journey across the
bridge she stops stilled with terror In the distance is a
sound that seems very much like that of the hoofs of an
approaching horse galloping closer through the winter night
Amy turns and looks behind her

The post road as Amy sees it stretching out into the
shadows There is nothing stirring but the sound of the
approaching horseman grows louder and louder

Amy turns her head away and starts to run The sound grows
louder closer filling the screen Amy stumbles and falls
She cowers against the side of the bridge as the rider
thunders down upon her The sound tears past her anda
shadow brushes by her and is gone Timidly she looks up

REAR SHOT of an old automobile as Amy sees it driven as
fast as possible across the snowy road The car has no
lights

CAMERA PANS DOWN TO a CLOSEUP of a back tire of the
automobile It is covered with a chain but the chain has
become loose and is flapping rhythmically against the road
making a sound like that of horse hoofs

REAR SHOT of the automobile as it disappears into the forest
Amy rises to her feet She brushes the wet snow off her coat
and continues on across the bridge As she reaches the end of
the bridge a few snowflakes begin to fall upon her It is

snowing again Amy looks up

Amy hesitates a moment looking at the tulip tree
EXT ANDRES TREE - NIGHT

Major Andres tree with its gnarled branches covered with
snow and ice stands black and forbidding against the
background of white snow

EXT POST ROAD - NIGHT

Amy hesitates reluctant to pass the tree It is snowing
hard now and a shrill wind is blowing The gaunt tulip tree
is even more dreadful now with the wind waving the branches
about against the snow The shadows are long and wavering
Suddenly with a gust of wind the branches blow downward like
long thin arms reaching to ensnare Amy Amy terrified
turns leaves the road and runs into the adjoining snow
covered meadow

EXT MEADOW - NIGHT

curtained window looking out at the storm The wind sounds
shrill With a shiver Barbara drops the curtain and comes
back into the room She picks up a decanter and pours herself
a drink which she downs quickly

Julia Farren is sitting by a lamp going through an old
prompt book She looks up and the faintest shadow of a smile
shows on her face as she looks at Barbara The wind beats
against the house Nervously Barbara pours herself another
drink and is about to drink it when she discovers her mother
watching her Mrs Farren smiles and a little chuckle
escapes from her lips

MRS FARREN
Dont you like the wind Regan Or is

But I am Barbara I didnt die

MRS FARREN
My Barbara was killed I killed her Yes

raging wind that night and snow and ice
All was well until we got to the Sleepy
Hollow bridge Barbara was singing a
little song and then I dont know how
it happened when I awakened they told
me the car was overturned and they
wouldnt let me see Barbara Barbara was
dead

Barbara comes close to her mother and leans over her

BARBARA
But I didnt die Dont you understand
It was you Your mind was dead for nearly
ten years after that accident You didnt
know anybody you couldnt remember
anything And then when memory returned
you called for me and I came into your
bedroom to see you I was sixteen years
old then ten years older than when you
last remembered me You said I wasnt
your daughter I loved you I wanted
you for my motherbut you denied me
You said they were playing tricks on you
that your daughter was a little girl

She takes the old woman by the shoulders and stares at her
intensely

BARBARA (CONTD)
Look at me now Look into my eyes Tell
me Im Barbara your daughter Barbara

Mrs Farren looks at Barbara for a moment then shakes her
head and withdraws back into her chair tearing the girls
fingers from her shoulders

is a lie Youre a poor drunken woman
Youre not my Barbara

Her breath is icy

Amy stumbles onward through the snowstorm She falls and lies
for a moment her cheek against the cold whiteness Then she
drags herself to her feet and stands wearily swaying with
fatigue She forces herself on and reaches a great boulder
She rests there for a moment leaning hard against the frozen
rock of ice and snow She slips to her knees and leans back
against the rock She can go no further The snow falls
relentlessly upon her

bark again far away Amys eyelids flicker Over the scene
as in Amys mind is the voice of Mrs Farren saying
repeatedly

Again the hounds bark and the captains shrill whistle
sounds in the distance Amy is jolted suddenly out of her
sleep She rubs her eyes and listens Far away once more
