Most remain unexplored
They represent the last great frontier on Earth

INTEXT EXECUTIVE HELICOPTER PAPUA NEW GUINEA — DAY

An out of focus light reflects the deep blue sparkle of the
ocean The scene has a washed out bright feel as if froma
distant memory

TIGHT on the face of JOSH MCGUIRE He’s gazing through
the copilot window of an AUGUSTA EXECUTIVE HELICOPTER

He’s tall slightly built and slovenly dressed in skater-punk
gear He has a wisp of a goatee beard and Optic Nerve shades
He looks fidgety apprehensive His voice carries the trace
of an Australian accent

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
I took off So what I can do what
I want I’m not a kid anymore It
aint all about you

Suddenly the scene comes sharply into focus snapping into
bright color as the ROAR of the engines grows louder

The DELVENETCOM HELICOPTER banks sharply as it clears the
coastline of Papua New Guinea

Lush rainforest as far as the eye can see In the distance a
range of mist-covered mountains No sign of civilization The
edge of the last great wilderness

CARL (AMERICAN ACCENT)
They’re calling it what

Flying the chopper is self-made billionaire CARL HURLEY
(30s) Faded jeans and a t-shirt with ‘MY OTHER HELICOPTER
Is A JET’ printed across the front
VICTORIA
“Hurley’s Hole”

Josh smirks at this He turns around to see VICTORIA ALLAIN
(30s) sitting in the rear passenger seat reading the WALL
STREET JOURNAL She looks tired and jet-lagged in her
crumpled business suit but still manages to retain a
natural understated beauty

CARL
Goddamn it

VICTORIA (READING)
“Carl Hurley’s latest ‘ego tour’
to dive the ‘Mount Everest’ of
underwater caves in Papua New
Guinea has already cost over three
million dollars and leaves many
shareholders questioning his
loyalties

CARL
They can all go to hell

VICTORIA (READING)
“The thirty-six year old CEO of
Delvenet”

JOSH
Jeez that’s old man

CARL
Shut it

VICTORIA (READING)
“whose previous stunts include
scaling Everest diving Brittanic
and base jumping the Eiffel Tower
is furious at the lack of media
coverage his latest expedition
yada yada yada There’s a cartoon
as well

CARL (TO JOSH)
Take over Keep the horizon above
the dash like I told you

Josh flashes a quick look at Victoria lowering his shades as
he grabs the CYCLIC STICK He’s obviously trying to impress
her
CARL
No problemo

VICTORIA (NERVOUS)
Carl

CARL
Give me that piece of crap

Victoria shakes her head wearily and tightens her seat belt
Carl snatches the newspaper and gazes down at the headline

DELVING INTO DEBT A caricature of Carl wearing SCUBA
EQUIPMENT as he studies a FINANCIAL FLOW CHART hung outside a
cave Another DIVER informs him “That ain’t your dive
profile it’s your share value”

Josh glances at the cartoon and shares a smile with Victoria
The chopper wobbles slightly Josh blushes as he snaps his
attention back to flying

CARL
This expedition’s been a cluster
fuck from start to finish No
disrespect Josh but your father’s
full of shit

JOSH (AWKWARD LAUGH)
Yeah

CARL (SARCASTIC)
The world’s greatest cave diver
All he can find down there are dead-
ends No wonder we lost press
coverage

VICTORIA
Youre insane Frustrated
astronauts all of you

Carl gazes down at the rainforest

CARL
There could be miles of unexplored
passage down there Just waiting to
be discovered

VICTORIA
Yeah well You’d better discover
it quick Here’s your schedule for
next week

She hands him a sheet of paper covered in colored bars
CARL
Shit

Carl RIPS up the schedule in frustration

CARL
Shit shit shit

A long and uncomfortable silence Victoria leans forward
toward Josh a smirk on her face

VICTORIA (DRAMATIC VOICE)
Looks like ‘Hurley’s Hole’ may
remain foreverunprobed

Josh cracks up LAUGHING

VRRRROOM The helicopter LURCHES VIOLENTLY as Carl grabs the
CONTROL STICK and flings them 500ft down a steep sided
valley Victoria SCREAMS as Carl expertly puts the helicopter
through a 360’ BARREL-ROLL Josh clings on for dear life as
the valley walls flash by

Carl levels off thirty feet above a huge river the engine
WHINING in protest Carl is LAUGHING

VICTORIA (FURIOUS)
You reckless son of a bitch

JOSH
That was sweet Do it again
INTEXT RIVER VALLEY - DAY
VARIOUS SHOTS as the helicopter winds its way down the

valley following the surging river Victoria tries to engage
the recalcitrant Josh in conversation

VICTORIA
How’d you wind up here Josh
JOSH
Court makes me see my Dad twice a
year
CARL

Bit like boot camp

VICTORIA
Whats Frank like I‘ve heard
conflicting reports
JOSH
Yeah

CARL
“Conflicting” pretty much sums him
up (beat) Alright folks We’re
here

Suddenly the ground falls away The helicopter drops over
the edge of a waterfall that cascades 1000ft into a DOLINE a
vast circular hole in the valley floor A beautiful rainbow
hangs above the waterfall

The helicopter powers forward toward BASECAMP a cluster of
PORTACABINS and large MACHINERY perched at the far side of
the cliff

Josh suddenly looks sad He stares down at the base of the
waterfall where the river disappears through a gaping
vertical crack in the rock

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
I can feel your hatred

EXT SERENITY CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

At the bottom of the cliff a thick COMMUNICATION CABLE winds
its way into the darkness following the river BATS and
SWALLOWS flit and dart in the dark zone

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)

Every hundred feet or so a HIGH INTENSITY DISCHARGE (HID)
LIGHT has been clipped to the wall illuminating the tunnel

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
Breathe it

INT SANTO CAVE SYSTEM

HIGH SPEED as we follow the cable through miles of cave
slowing occasionally at key points The cable leads us
through tight tunnels air-filled chambers surging rivers
and over powerful waterfalls rigged with rope bridges

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
-through miles of rock

Finally at the end of the tunnel a dance of light
INT FORWARD BASE

The river spills out into a vast chamber three quarters
filled with water An island rises above the water
illuminated by powerful HID LIGHTS Forward base looks like
an explosion in a dive store SCUBA EQUIPMENT is littered
everywhere WETSUITS hanging on a line REBREATHERS and DIVER
PROPULSION VEHICLES

In the center of the island sits a large TENT The glow from
several COMPUTER MONITORS can be seen through the fabric A
FIBER-OPTIC cable leads from the tent toward a DIVE PLATFORM
that extends into the water

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
--I hope you never come out

Australian cave diver FRANK MCGUIRE (early 40s) stands alone
in the gin-clear water He wears a scuffed and worn WETSUIT
Frank exudes a quiet confidence A man who keeps his own
counsel He’s as hard and as cold as the caves he explores

Frank’s eyes are closed in meditation as he rehearses
emergency BAIL-OUT DRILLS He moves with fluid clarity as if
practising Tai-Chi

JUDES Yeah (beat) Just tired You know

Sitting on the edge of the dive platform is CRAZY GEORGE

George is a tall and wiry Texan who looks like a hippy Hes
busy operating the joystick control of a CAVE MAPPING ROV

JUDY JUDES TREBLE (30s) stands in the water beside him
She is wearing a CLOSED CIRCUIT REBREATHER and CAVE DIVING
EQUIPMENT Judes is a serious-minded diver who likes to do
things by the book She also looks great in a wetsuit

CRAZY GEORGE
You wanna cancel the dive

JUDES

CRAZY GEORGE
No onell blame you Judes He’s

Frank “Anyone can call the dive at

Judes deliberates She looks yearningly toward her SLEEPING
BAG at the rear of the cave She looks tempted when
FRANK
You all set

FRANK wades toward them zipping up his suit His face is set
with an intense determined look He grabs his REBREATHER
from the dive platform and fires up the electronics

JUDES (FORCED CHEERFULNESS )

FRANK
You were assigned rope man You’re
supposed to be working here as part
of the team not off on some joy

Josh stares at his feet and snorts derisively it’s pretty
obvious he thinks his old man is a total dick

Josh reaches forward and defiantly flicks a switch The
screen suddenly goes blank Frank stares in disbelief Crazy
George tries hard not to laugh

INTEXT BASECAMP OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

a few seconds later She finds Josh around the back of the

the back

the water His voice sounds tense and strained

DIVER PROPULSION VEHICLES (DPVs) and STAGE CYLINDERS have
been clipped to a DECO LINE that descends into the inky
depths The DPVs look like miniature torpedoes fitted with
handlebars The divers collect their DPV‘s clip on their
STAGE CYLINDERS and power away into the inky depths

INT SUMP ONE

VRRRRR Powerful HID lights from the DPVs flit across the
walls of an enormous underwater cavern Frank follows a thin
GUIDELINE that snakes its way across the calcite-covered
ceiling The water is crystal clear visibility a hundred
feet or more The REBREATHERS lack of bubbles give the
divers the appearance of astronauts exploring inner space

Frank’s voice begins to relax becoming deep and reverent as
he recites Coleridge’s famous poem

FRANK (INNER MONOLOGUE )
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan
A stately pleasure dome decree
Where Alph the sacred river ran
Through caverns measureless to man
Down to a sunless sea

Frank’s lost the fucking plot

The KAMOV touches down creating a huge cloud of dust Jim
approaches one of the local villagers who is supervising the
unloading of OXYGEN CYLINDERS from the CRANE

still relatively calm “out of air”

Frank duck-dives down to her He removes his own mouthpiece
and offers it Judes gulps down several BREATHS They are
sinking fast Judes struggling to locate her WING INFLATOR

pulls the mouthpiece away from Judes She’s reluctant to let
it go Frank pulls harder

blind panic on her face She claws at Frank’s face ripping
off his mask

grows weaker and weaker until

EXT KASTOM VILLAGE - NIGHT

A huge bonfire in the center of the village DRUMS beat a
solemn rhythm as the LOCAL SHAMAN leads a dozen VILLAGERS in
a DEATH RITE around the fire Their painted bodies glisten in
the firelight Other VILLAGERS watch from the shadows
Scattered among them are several EXPEDITION MEMBERS looking
utterly defeated A couple of them are still crying

Josh Carl and Victoria sit inside an open hut Luko sits
with them preparing coconut shells of KAVA He chews on the
root from a pepper plant and SPITS the intoxicating residue
into the shells

CARL (TO JOSH)

--until youve experienced it
youll never understand Any fool
can climb a mountain Who knows
where this cave leads

JOSH (ANGRY)
Who fucking cares Death toll’s up
to three now

You never told me that

CARL
Ten years ago two divers stumbled
across this system Real
experienced I mean they’d been
pushing caves for thirty years

VICTORIA

CARL
No-one knows Their equipment was
washed up twenty miles away In the
ocean

JOSH
Whofuckingcares

CARL
Its a tired old world Josh Where
else do you get to shine a light
where no man has been before

JOSH

You wanna see something no-one’s

CARL
Judes thought so

A moment as they consider this
VICTORIA (TO CARL)
You think Frank1ll cancel the
expedition
CARL
He cant He needs it(beat) More
than any of us
Luko SPITS into the shell and offers them the kava

CARL (DISGUSTED)
He expects us to drink that

JOSH
Kava To honor Judes

Josh takes the shell and gulps down the intoxicating brew
Carl watches in horror as Victoria reaches for the shell She
shrugs at Carl

VICTORIA
I’ve swallowed worse

Victoria downs it in one
VICTORIA
Wow I can feel my lips going numb
already

Carl reaches forward and nervously takes the shell

JOSH
Just do it

Carl sips it gingerly holding his nose as he does so
Victoria takes perverse satisfaction in watching his
discomfort Carl GAGS and races out into the bushes

VICTORIA
(continuing)
Lightweight

Victoria staggers to her feet and follows Carl

VICTORIA
(continuing)
Oh man That shit is really good

Suddenly the DRUMS stop beating Silence descends upon the
village Joshs intoxicated mind reels from the kava as he
turns to see

Frank stepping out of the shadows looking utterly
exhausted He is caked in mud and looks like a primordial
nightmare George appears behind him The villagers WHISPER
nervously as they watch Frank approach the expedition
members Jim steps forward and offers his condolences Other
team members walk away in disgust Josh closes his eyes

A shadow falls across Joshs face He looks up to see Frank
standing above him Josh tenses as Frank sits next to him A
long awkward silence The drums continue their mournful
heartbeat building in intensity over the following

JOSH (FINALLY)
Look If youre gonna bollock me

JOSH (MUMBLING)

A distant CHANTING carried on the wind Curious she
staggers to the edge of the clearing to investigate

Victoria stumbles her way through the thick jungle She’s
still pretty intoxicated from the kava An owl SHRIEKS
startling her She listens again Silence Then a twig SNAPS

The CHANTING starts again Victoria nervously pushes forward
She emerges into a clearing at the edge of the doline

At the edge of the doline the KASTOM SHAMAN is surrounded by
several villagers performing an ancient PURIFICATION RITE
The Shaman’s grotesque DEATH MASK glints in the moonlight as
he incants a solemn PRAYER Victoria turns to leave

BLAM Luko suddenly looms over her swaying in a kava-induced
trance He doesn’t seem to recognize her Victoria GASPS in
fright After a few seconds Luko staggers past her toward
the ceremony

Josh steps out of the shadows grabs Victoria’s hand and
pulls her back into the jungle

VICTORIA (HUSHED WHISPER)

above his head The villagers WHISPER to each other as the
PRAYER continues Some of them look really frightened

He’s warning them to stay out of

out over the cliff wall plunging violently into the cave
below Josh deliberates He stares down at the maelstrom of
white-water CRASHING its way into the cave It looks scarey
as hell

Looking up Josh notices a figure watching him from the
opposite side of the doline The grotesque MASK of the Shaman

him down into the tunnel CRUNCH The BOULDER slams into the
tunnel entrance sealing it shut

They SLAM into Frank knocking him over the edge of the

base of the cliff and drags himself out of the water

winded

Josh fights his way back to the surface at the far side of
the pool and is almost sucked downstream He grabs a rock at
the edge of the pool and pulls himself out of the flow

all you need to know

Crazy George eyes the rising water

CRAZY GEORGE
(continuing)
One thing’s for sure stay here and
y’all better start growing gills

CUT TO

In the far section of the cavern Josh wades through the
water grabbing anything that looks useful Suddenly he
freezes in front of him wrapped around a rock is Lukos
body Its a ghastly sight The river has broken every bone
in his body His jaw is almost hanging off Josh shudders

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
I‘m sorryI’m sorryI’m
SOLry

Luko opens his eyes Josh jumps in fright

JOSH
Over here Someone bring the
medical kit

The others wade over and stand horrified Frank takes one
look at Luko and throws the medical kit away He leans
forward to examine him Luko tries to speak Bloody froth
pours from his broken jaw

FRANK
Easy Dont try to talk

CARL
How bad is it

FRANK

JOSH

FRANK
Theres nothing we can do

JOSH
What do you mean

FRANK

VICTORIA (HORRIFIED)
Oh Jesus no No

Carl puts his arm around Victoria She shrugs him off

JOSH
You have to help him

Josh turns to the others
JOSH

(continuing)
Tell him He has to do something

FRANK
What do you want me to do Hes
broken every bone in his body He
cant hold a reg in his mouth

JOSH
You cant just leave him to die

FRANK

CRAZY GEORGE
Cmon Josh let’s go

JOSH
Get your fucking hands off me

FRANK

JOSH (TO FRANK)
Youre going to kill him arent

Frank suddenly explodes in anger and frustration

FRANK (FURIOUS)
You havent a fucking clue have
you Any of you You’ve spent your
whole lives wrapped in cotton wool
You wanna play at being
adventurers Well welcome to the
show First prize - you get to
live second prize you don’t Boo-

Silence as they consider this Victoria steps forward leans
toward Luko and kisses his hand Luko MOANS in pain Victoria
starts to WEEP Carl leads her away

JOSH
George Im begging you Please
dont let him do this

CRAZY GEORGE
Come away Josh

JOSH (PLEADING)

There must be something we can do
Anything

CRAZY GEORGE
There is you can do as Frank says

Josh stands helpless After a few seconds he follows Crazy
George into the darkness Frank approaches his old friend
Though barely conscious Luko seems to understand what must
be done

cut TO
Josh flashes his light back toward his father Frank is
holding Lukos head beneath the surface of the water Josh
shudders and turns away
INT UNDERWATER DECO HABITAT - ONE HOUR LATER
The team float upon the surface of the moon pool wearing
full DIVE EQUIPMENT Frank surfaces Josh still cant bring
himself to look at him

FRANK (GRIM)
Thats it It’s totally flooded

A moment as they take this in
CRAZY GEORGE (TO VICTORIA AND CARL)
Alright Lets start the buddy
checks
Frank swims over to check Josh’s REBREATHER
FRANK
So I finally managed to get you
into one of these

JOSH (FLINCHING)
Get the fuck off me

An awkward silence Frank reaches forward and tugs on Josh’s
harness tightening his straps Josh avoids eye contact

FRANK CRAZY GEORGE
Keep hold of the line at all All gasses on Okay Start
timesI taught you how to callin the numbers
clear your mask

JOSH CARL
Yeah A hundred times Oxygen 200 Trimix 220

FRANK CRAZY GEORGE

Josh SIGHS and demonstrates the technique

FRANK
Good You keep your
mouthpiece in at all times
Flood the breathing loop and
it’s all over

JOSH (PROVOCATIVE)
Like Judes you mean

FRANK (NOT BITING)
Yeah Just like Judes

JOSH
Look I remember how to dive
Carl has already taken me
through it

FRANK
Well now you get to hear it

JOSH

No ‘cause I’m stupid

CARL

VICTORIA (ANNOYED)

CRAZY GEORGE
Trimix set to 1080 Gradient

Crazy George suddenly leans over and grabs Josh

CRAZY GEORGE
Hey You wanna end up like me

Josh says nothing

CRAZY GEORGE

Then you better smarten up

You get

bent down here it’s gonna ruin

your whole day

VICTORIA (SARCASTIC)
And our day was going so well

FRANK (TO JOSH AND VICTORIA)
Well have about four hours of
decompression to do once we reach
the other side Stay at the same
depth as me or your bloodll start
fizzing like a dropped soda

VICTORIA
Nice(acid to Carl) You actually
choose to do this

FRANK
All right lets visualize the
dive Visibility’s gonna be stirred
to shit so we can’t use the DPV’s
We have a long swim to the
restriction Stay behind me at all
times and pace yourselves The
tunnel gets real tight in places
Dont freak out if it silts up
Just stay on the line and wait for
it to clear

CRAZY GEORGE
You want me to bring up the rear

FRANK
I‘1l lead followed by Josh then
Carl then you (beat) Victoria at
the back

Victoria glares at Frank The implication is clear Franks
worried shell panic

FRANK
(continuing)
Focus on breathing Deep and slow
One person loses it down there we
all die
Victoria looks sick with fright

CARL (PATRONIZING)
You can do this baby Be brave

Victoria glares at him murderously

FRANK
Everyone clear on the plan

JOSH
Basically we follow you keep
breathing and hope nothing beeps
Frank and Crazy George exchange a look

CRAZY GEORGE
Thats about the gist of it

FRANK
Any questions

No one says a word

FRANK
I’1l1 see you on the other side

VICTORIA (DEADPAN)
Not literally I hope

Frank flashes the “down” signal They sink beneath the
surface

INT UNDER THE DECO HABITAT

The water turns a dirty blood-red ochre as the divers follow
Frank into the mixing zone Their powerful HID LIGHTS
barely penetrate the thick clouds of silt that dance and
swirl across their face masks A surreal descent into a
pinkish cloud of ghostly shadows

Frank locates the GUIDELINE and wraps Joshs hand firmly
around it Josh follows Franks fins into the murk

INT UNDERWATER SUMP
VARIOUS SHOTS as a thick shroud of silt cocoons the divers

Frank appears out of the gloom his thumb and forefinger
circled around the GUIDELINE He sweeps his arm up and down
through the murk like a blind man using a cane He passes
several plastic CAVE ARROWS clipped to the line at
intervals pointing the way back out Suddenly the cave wall
materializes in Franks HID LIGHT

Josh jumps in fright as Frank’s face suddenly looms out of
the dark They exchange “okay” signals and descend along the
cave wall

CRUMP Carl bangs into the cave wall dislodging a huge
STALACTITE He YELLS a muffled warning into his mouthpiece

Crazy George CURSES as the STALACTITE whizzes by narrowly

missing him Victoria tightens her grip around Crazy George’s
wrist They continue onward

INT DEVILS RESTRICTION

Frank leads the divers along the GUIDELINE until they reach
the claustrophobic tunnel It’s barely visible through the
milky white-out

Victorias eyes widen when she sees how tight the restriction
is We hear her BREATHING increase as she fights the rising
wave of panic Frank circles his flashlight okay He
receives a shaky signal back from her

Frank and George remove the EQUIPMENT PACKS from their
harness and clip them around their ankles so they can be
dragged through the tunnel Silt swirls

Frank removes his REBREATHER and holds it in front of him
The others nervously do the same Frank signals for Josh to
‘buddy up’ with him Pushing his REBREATHER ahead of him
Frank disappears into the hole After a few seconds Josh
follows

INT BODY TUBE - DEVILS RESTRICTION

POV Josh He follows Frank into the tunnel keeping his hand
on the line at all times Franks pack and fins can just be
seen scraping along the tunnel ahead Breathe Push Breathe
Push

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
Stay green Please stay green
Don’t beep Please Don’t fucking
beep

INT UNDERWATER TUNNEL - DEVILS RESTRICTION

Back at the entrance Carl disappears into the tunnel Crazy
George turns toward Victoria and taps her on the shoulder
She jumps George shows her a message on his WRIST SLATE
YOU CAN DO IT next to a SMILEY FACE Victoria nods her
head grateful Crazy George squeezes her hand reassuringly
Then he disappears into the tunnel

INT BODY TUBE - DEVILS RESTRICTION

A nightmarish sequence as the divers crawl down the body tube
in near-zero visibilty

Frank glances behind him The dull orange glow of Joshs
light approaches They exchange ‘okay’ signals

Further back in the tunnel Carl wedges stuck He tries to
turn around but cant move His BREATHING skyrockets Carl
braces himself and STRAINS against the ceiling White
fragments of rock break free and dance like snowflakes
against his helmet He eventually manages to pull himself
forward

Crazy George freezes as the ceiling starts to CREAK and

GROAN He glances back and sees Victoria waiting patiently
for him They exchange ‘okay’ signals After a few seconds
George continues his eyes glued nervously to the ceiling

Victoria claws her way forward following Crazy George’s
EQUIPMENT BAG Her eyes are fixed with dogged determination
Shes HUMMING a tune “ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS” to calm
herself down

INT UNEXPLORED ABYSS

Darkness Then the hazy glow of approaching lights A thick
cloud of silt billows from the tunnel in the cliff wall Like
free-fall parachutists emerging from a cloud the divers
break through into the gin-clear waters of the abyss

Victoria finally appears a victorious grin on her face
Crazy George swims over shakes her hand and then helps her
back into the REBREATHER Frank shows Josh his VR3 DIVE
COMPUTER

DEPTH 102M TOTAL DECO 245 MINS

Josh neds his understanding Frank flashes everyone the ‘up’
signal

VARIOUS SHOTS as the team slowly work their way up the cave
walls decompressing every few feet

Frank swims over to check on the others periodically The
TOTAL DECO TIME slowly ticks down on their DIVE COMPUTERS

Crazy George hovers next to Victoria adjusting her buoyancy
as required Victoria is SHIVERING from the cold George rubs
her hands trying to warm her up

Carl swims away from the others far out into the abyss He’s
busy exploring the far side of the cave

Frank signals for Josh to ascend to the next deco stop His
eyes narrow in concern when he sees Josh isn’t moving He
swims over and catches him playing the OCTOPUS video game
on his VR3 DIVE COMPUTER Frank MUMBLES angrily into his
MOUTHPIECE and signals “up”

Finally Crazy George flashes his beam to get everyones
attention the team visibly relax as their lights reflect off
the surface far above them

INT UNEXPLORED CAVERN
VARIOUS REACTION SHOTS as the team surface

They remove their MOUTHPIECES and gratefully suck down great
gulps of air Then they gaze around them in wonder The
cavern is huge an endless dessert of sand dunes rising from
the water and disappearing into the darkness A sunless
Sahara with no sign of the walls or ceiling

Crazy George throws back his head and emits a WHOOP of
delight His voice ECHOES into the darkness

INT UNEXPLORED CAVERN - THE NEXT DAY

Blackness Josh wakes with a start and stares up at the cave
ceiling It takes him a moment to remember where he is

Frank is busy changing the batteries in the FLASHLIGHTS
George is filling a DRIED FOOD PACK with water Carl is sat
alone on a rock staring out into space Victoria lies
SHIVERING inside her SPACE BLANKET she’s hypothermic and
utterly miserable GEORGE offers her some food

Josh crawls toward the EQUIPMENT BAGS and starts rummaging
through the SUPPLIES He pulls out a food bag and walks down
to the water Frank crouches by the shoreline his flashlight
fixed upon a submerged rock far out in the water He’s
watching listening feeling the cave

FRANK
How are the supplies looking

Josh is still angry He ignores his father

FRANK (ANGRY)
I said

JOSH
Theres food for a couple of days

FRANK
This place will be underwater in a
couple of days

JOSH (DERISIVELY)
How do you know

FRANK
See that rock Last night it was
above water

Frank marches over to the EQUIPMENT BAG and pulls out several
items A ROPE COMPASS and VERTICAL GEAR Carl shuffles over

CARL
How long before they come and get
us

FRANK
Who

CARL

The rescue party
Frank smiles at this

FRANK
Theres no rescues down here mate
Only body recoveries

CARL
But when word gets out Im

FRANK
Then what No amount of money is
gonna save you now Folk up there

CRAZY GEORGE (DEADPAN)
Reckon I should of sold my Delvenet
shares

Frank smiles as he shoulders the rope

CARL (FUMING)
I just want to know what the plan
is

FRANK
No plan ever survived contact with

the enemy And this cave just shat
out every plan I had

CARL (SHOUTING)
Then what pray tell do you
suggest we do

Frank marches over to him

FRANK
You could try calling your lawyers
so they can sue me Oh no I
forgot

Frank lowers his voice to an angry whisper

FRANK
Some fucker switched the comms off

Carl goes white as a sheet as Frank storms off

FRANK (TO JOSH)
Stay here I’m going to scout
ahead

Carl shouts after him

CARL (CALLING AFTER HIM)
I still think we should sit tight
and wait a few days

FRANK (OVER HIS SHOULDER)
For what The lights to go out
Batteries wont last forever

Carl considers this Then reaches up and switches his HELMET
LIGHT off

CARL
Fucker

Josh watches his fathers light disappear into the distance
After a few moments he decides to follow him

INT SUNLESS SAHARA

An expanse of sand dunes stretch along the banks of an
underground lake Frank follows the shoreline flashing his
light around the cave Josh follows keeping out of sight
Frank pauses to take a compass reading Josh ducks as Frank’s
light swings toward him When Josh looks up Frank is gone

Josh considers following Then gazes nervously around him

JOSH
Fuck it

He stumbles back the way he came

INT UNEXPLORED CAVERN

Back at the sump Victoria is still SHIVERING uncontrollably
A single light casts gloomy shadows across the walls

CRAZY GEORGE (TO VICTORIA)
How you doing

VICTORIA (SHIVERING)
I-I still cant feel my feet

Crazy George lifts the space blanket and pulls off Victorias
soaked WETSUIT BOOTEES

CRAZY GEORGE
Theyre like blocks of ice

Crazy George starts rubbing Victorias feet and legs Carl
casts a glance but decides to say nothing

VICTORIA
T-Thank you George

CRAZY GEORGE
Aint nothin’

VICTORIA
I mean back there The way you
h-helped me It waswas

Victoria stops herself before she gets upset

CARL (TO GEORGE)
Pity our illustrious leader doesnt
share your humanity

CRAZY GEORGE
Franks got Josh to think about
now

CARL
That man only thinks about himself
Hed leave us all to die if he had
to

CRAZY GEORGE
Dont go sayin that (trying to
convince himself) Franks gonna get
us out of here

CARL
Christ George Wake up You saw
what he did to Luko What makes you
think he values our lives any
differently

CRAZY GEORGE
He just lives by a different set of
rules that’s all He did what
needed to be done None of us had
the stomach for it

CARL
Precisely And thats what makes us
human beings

VICTORIA (ANGRY)
Spare us the morality lessons
Carl You have no right to judge
anyone least of all Frank It was
a mercy killing

CARL
Yeah Lets see if the authorities
agree when we get out of here

VICTORIA
You can be such an asshole

CARL
I cant believe youre taking his
side in this

VICTORIA (BITTER)
Hes not the one who got us into
this mess

CARL
Whats that supposed to mean

VICTORIA
You know damn well
INT SUNLESS SAHARA
Josh scrambles BREATHLESSLY to the top of a boulder pile He
looks confused and scared when his light fails to reveal the

others waiting on the other side Instead a vast GAPING
TUNNEL leads further into the cave

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
Fuck (beat) Keep going you ain’t
lost (beat) They have to be through
there

Josh stumbles on deeper into the cave

INT UNEXPLORED CAVERN
Victoria pulls herself to her feet and staggers towards Carl

VICTORIA
You turned off the comm
system (beat) Didn’t you

Crazy George looks up

CARL
Why the hell would I do that

VICTORIA (EXPLODING)
“Uncontactable until further
notice” Well we’re pretty un-
fucking-contactable now

CARL
Youre delusional

VICTORIA
Delusional Look where we fucking
are You may have just killed us
all

A voice from the shadows

FRANK
It dont matter now

Frank steps out of the darkness Hes overheard everything

FRANK
(continuing)
None of it What matters now is
survival

CARL
Youre enjoying this arent you
Making life or death decisions
Playing God

FRANK
Theres no God down here mate
This cave doesnt give a flying
fuck about you me or Christ-all-
mighty Were specks of dust to
her passing through

CARL
What the hell was I thinking
letting you talk me into this
Youre a fucking animal Even your
gon cant stand the sight of you

Frank glances around

FRANK
Where is Josh

INT SUNLESS SAHARA

Josh reaches the top of another dune A vast expanse of
nothingness lays before him

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
Fuck it Give them a shout they‘re
bound to hear you (beat) You’d
never hear the last of it (beat)
Admit it you’re lost (beat)
Alright retrace your steps

Josh turns and flashes his light back the way he’s come
Three identical-looking tunnels lead into the rockface behind
him

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
Oh shit

CUT TO

Frank and George are following Josh’s footprints They end
abruptly at the edge of a shingle collapse

FRANK
Josh Josh

His voice ECHOES eerily around the walls of the cave

CRAZY GEORGE
Quit freakin’ out He’ll be fine

FRANK
Goddamn it George You were
supposed to watch him

CRAZY GEORGE
The boy wanted to go off

exploring(grinning) Remind you of
anyone

Frank scowls and storms away Crazy George smiles as he
watches him disappear into the darkness

CRAZY GEORGE (IN PAIN)
Gnnn

George suddenly winces in pain He lifts his arm and flexes
it a concerned look on his face

CUT TO
Josh is about to enter the largest tunnel when
FRANK (DISTANT 0S)
Josh
He freezes as he hears Frank’s voice But he can’t tell which
direction it’s coming from

JOSH
I‘m through here

A few seconds of silence

FRANK (CLOSER 0S)
Don’t move Keep talking

JOSH (SLOWLY CIRCLING)
What do you want me to say (beat)

I think I’ve found the way forward

(beat) I was just coming to tell
you

BLAM A hand shoots out of the dark and grabs Josh by the
shoulder Frank spins him around and shakes him

FRANK
I thought I told you to stay with
the group

JOSH
I-I

FRANK
You get lost down here and it’s all
over Dont ever wander off again
Understand

Josh bristles in anger and SLAPS Frank’s hand away

JOSH
Get off me

Joshs voice ECHOES into the far distance Frank’s head snaps
up it sounds like the cave goes on forever Crazy George
steps out of the shadows still flexing his wrist He grins
through the pain and slaps Josh on the back

CRAZY GEORGE
Shoot I reckon the boys done
found the way forward

INT FOOTBALL FIELD CHAMBER

A vast chamber larger than several football fields No sign
of the walls or ceiling Three specks of light appear in the
distance Two more lights trail behind them

Josh plods along next to Crazy George They both struggle
under the weight of their REBREATHERS and also carry a heavy
EQUIPMENT BAG between them Crazy George keeps flexing his
hand every few seconds a worried expression on his face

JOSH
Asshole Hes a fucking asshole

CRAZY GEORGE
Hell hes just tryin’ to look out
for you Easy enough to get lost in
a place like this

JOSH
Nothings ever good enough I
remember writing a school project
for him once A cave diving
adventure He hands it back to me
with a list of technical notes

CRAZY GEORGE (A KNOWING SMILE)
Yeah Frank sure likes to give a
lotta notes

JOSH
I was seven years old George

CRAZY GEORGE
Did you hear about the time Frank
really fucked up

Josh tries to conceal his interest

CRAZY GEORGE
(continuing)
Couple of years ago he’s in the
outback checking out this massive
hole name of

Crazy George grinds to a halt confused and then a little
scared as he struggles to remember the name

CRAZY GEORGE
Damn what was that place called

He drops the EQUIPMENT BAG and leans exhausted against a
large rock Josh looks at him bemused

CRAZY GEORGE (SHAKING HIS HEAD)
Anyhow he backs his truck right up
to the water so he can tie off his
line Then he does his dive

Crazy George takes a long pull of water from his flask

CRAZY GEORGE
On the way back out he sees the
entrance is blocked by a vehicle
sixty feet underwater And hes
like Shit that licence plate
looks familiar (beat) Hed only
gone and left the handbrake off

Josh smiles

CRAZY GEORGE
(continuing)
Had to smash open his back window
just so he could swim out

Josh LAUGHS

CRAZY GEORGE (CHUCKLING)
And then he has to haul his sorry
ass back over 60 miles of desert
(beat)
Hes a hell of a guy your old man
Once you get to know him

Josh considers this

CRAZY GEORGE
(beat) Take the bag will ya Go on
Ill catch up directly

Crazy George waits until Josh has gone then starts
scribbling numbers onto his WRIST SLATE His hand is SHAKING
uncontrollably as he writes 101-7

Crazy George struggles to do the math After a few seconds
he realizes he can’t work out the answer

CRAZY GEORGE (SCARED WHISPER)
Ah shit

He opens the MOUTHPIECE on his REBREATHER and flushes the
loop with the button marked OXYGEN Breathing from the
REBREATHER he staggers after Josh’s light

INT BOTTOM OF BOULDER PILE FOOTBALL FIELD CHAMBER

Football Field chamber ends in a huge mountain of rubble that
disappears into the higher reaches of the cave Victoria
collapses SHIVERING on a rock She watches Carl’s light
ascending up the debris slope far above her

VICTORIA (ANNOYED)
Carl Wait for me

A voice in the darkness startles her Frank steps out of the
shadows

FRANK
Are you okay

VICTORIA (SHIVERING)
Hot bath and a brandy and Id be
fine

FRANK
Well camp here

Frank nods toward Carl’s distant light

FRANK
(continuing)
Im guessing this is a little more
adventurous than his usual
excursions

VICTORIA

Next year were sticking to
Disneyland

FRANK
Howd you ever wind up with a guy
like that

VICTORIA
I ask myself that question every
day (beat) I was one of his guides
on Everest (smiling) Bastard had
me fired so I‘d come and work for
him How about you How’d you get
involved with the dot-com devil

FRANK
Usual sponsors would have turned
this into a circus Twenty guys
all with different agendas Ive
dealt with enough of those
fucksticks to last a lifetime

Rocks CLATTER down the slope as Carl reaches the top

FRANK
I figured your boy up there was the
best way to get some real
exploration done (beat)
This wasn’t quite what I had in
mind

Victoria smiles as she gazes into Franks eyes

VICTORIA
Well I’m glad youre here to look
after us

FRANK

Don’t go fooling yourself Down
here youre on your own

A voice from the darkness above them
CARL
Victoria You have to see this
Its incredible
Victoria shakes her head sadly and starts climbing the
boulder pile
EXT TOP OF BOULDER PILE

Carl stands on top of the highest boulder The team stagger
up the final few yards to join him

CARL
Welcome to ‘Carls Cavern

Frank and Crazy George exchange a withering look FLASH
Carl’s powerful CAMERA STROBE reveals the vastness of the
chamber they have just walked through The walls and ceiling
are covered in millions of delicate white straws

CARL (CLICKING PHOTOS)
Hey Josh Get up here Well make
the cover of ‘National Geographic
yet

CRAZY GEORGE (TO FRANK)
National Lampoon more like

Josh scrambles up to the highest boulder and poses for Carl
Frank storms over and snatches the camera off Carl He hurls
it far over the edge of the boulder slope After a few
seconds we hear it SMASH apart below

A moment of tension as Carl and Frank face each other
Suddenly Carl launches himself at Frank George stumbles
between them

CRAZY GEORGE
Whoa Lets calm it down

CARL (SCREAMING)
You fucking asshole You fuck
fuck fucking asshole

FRANK
Yeah yeah yeah

CARL
Why the fuck would you do that
What gives you the fucking right to
do that To me

Frank pushes past George and grabs Carl by the throat
SLAMMING him against the boulder

FRANK
You listen to me When they pull
our bodies outta here they aint
finding no Goddamn tourist shots
Not of me and not of my son
grinning like an idiot Understand

JOSH
Let him go

CRAZY GEORGE
Jesus Frank Youre choking him

VICTORIA
Frank please Let him go

Frank releases Carl Carl slumps to the floor clutching his
throat

FRANK
They’1l find us with our tanks
empty and our fingers scraped to
the bone

Frank turns to Josh
FRANK
(continuing)
They aint handing your mother a
Goddamn photograph

Frank storms away back down the boulder slope

INT BOTTOM OF BOULDER PILE - NEXT MORNING

TIGHT on Frank looking grim as he fits the last set of
BATTERIES into the flashlights He shoulders his pack and
starts KICKING everyone awake

FRANK
Cmon Let’s move

Various GROANS as everyone rolls over in their SPACE BLANKETS
in a vain attempt to go back to sleep

FRANK (ROARING)

NOW
INT TUNNELS
VARIOUS SHOTS Frank leads the team along a series of narrow
tunnels winding ever upwards Several smaller tunnels branch
off Frank ignores them and continues moving forward
INT THE DROP
The tunnel ends abruptly at the edge of a sheer drop No way
forward The team collapse to the floor utterly exhausted

Frank crouches at the edge of the precipice and launches a
rock

After six seconds we hear a distant SPLOSH

CARL
Maybe we missed something We could
always go back

FRANK
We ain’t going back

Frank tosses the rope down into the drop and secures it

FRANK (TO VICTORIA)
I want you to start ferrying the
others down as quickly as
possible

VICTORIA (SHIVERING)
I-I‘1ll try I’m just not sure I c-
can hold a r-ope anymore

JOSH
Ill do it Give it to me

Frank casts a quick glance at Carl

FRANK
No

Josh sags and slouches away Frank calls after him

FRANK
I need a good rope man below

Josh swells slightly at this veiled compliment and starts
eagerly prepping his vertical gear Victoria flashes an
approving smile at Frank Frank shrugs as if to say “yeah
yeah”

Carl ambles over to Crazy George who is resting further down
the tunnel breathing oxygen from his REBREATHER He quickly
conceals his SHAKING ARM as Carl approaches

CARL (CONCERNED)
You okay

CRAZY GEORGE
Hell yeah Just catchin’ my
breath

CARL (WHISPERING)
Why the fuck is ‘Captain Caveman’
taking us deeper Makes no sense at
all

CRAZY GEORGE (SHRUGS)
Guess he’s following the river

CARL
All the way to the ocean

CRAZY GEORGE
If that’s what it takes

Crazy George goes back onto OXYGEN Carl calls over to Frank

CARL
Weve been climbing for six hours
now Surely we must be close to the
surface

FRANK (STUDYING THE ROCK)
I reckon we are aboutthirty feet
from the surface

Carl gazes up in astonishment And hope

FRANK
But unless you brought some
dynamite that aint gonna help us
much

CARL
We could at least split up and
search those passageways we passed

FRANK
They’re too small We go back down
And hope the lower cave ain’t
flooded yet

CARL
I say we vote on it

FRANK (LAUGHING)
You wanna wake up and have a word
with yourself This ain’t no
democracy

Frank steps off the edge of the drop and rappels down into
the darkness Josh clips himself onto the rope

CARL
Josh Help me search those tunnels

Josh deliberates

CARL
You don’t have to do everything he
says Josh You and I can find our
own way out of here

FRANK (0S)
Josh Get down here

Josh glances down at his father’s light far below He shrugs
and casts Carl an apologetic look Josh disappears over the
cliff Carl glowers after him

CARL (ANNOYED)
Idiots

Carl shoulders his pack

CARL (TO VICTORIA)
Cmon Lets go

Victoria glares up at him shivering and miserable She
slowly shakes her head

VICTORIA
I-I‘m staying with them Carl

TIGHT on Carl an angry and betrayed look upon his face as he
struggles to deal with this rejection

INT BELOW THE DROP

Frank stands waist deep in an underground lake holding onto
the bottom of the rope He gazes up at Josh’s light far above
him ZIIIIIIP Josh zooms down the rope and breaks hard
bouncing to a halt only inches above Franks head Frank
shoots him a disapproving look

FRANK
Quit showin’ off Wait here and
help the others I’11l scout on
ahead

Frank shoulders his EQUIPMENT BAG and wades out into the
water

JOSH (DISAPPOINTED)
When do I get to scout

FRANK
Soon as you stop getting lost

INT THE DROP

Crazy George is rappeling down a particularly steep part of
the shaft His REBREATHER dangles several feet below him
acting like a pendulum His face is screwed up in pain as he
edges his way down the sheer cliff wall

CRAZY GEORGE
Gnnnng

His body suddenly spasms his fist clamping up into a tightly
balled fist

CRAZY GEORGE (SCARED WHISPER)
Oh Christ Not now Please not
noW

A SHOUT from above causes him to look up Victoria peers down
at him a concerned look on her face

VICTORIA
Are you okay

CRAZY GEORGE
I-Im fine

Momentarily distracted he doesnt notice his LONG HAIR
slipping into the FIVE-BAR RACK George pushes himself weakly
off the wall ZIIIP He plunges several feet down the rope
his hand too weak to operate the brake His hair gets YANKED
VIOLENTLY into the rack almost scalping him In extreme
pain he grits his teeth and remains silent reluctant to let
the others know he is in trouble

CRAZY GEORGE (ANNOYED TO HIMSELF)
That’s just great George Call the
fucking rope police

He swings himself painfully toward a rocky ledge Tries to
transfer his body weight Success A SIGH of relief Reaching
toward his DIVE KNIFE he carefully starts sawing away at his
trapped hair

INT BELOW THE DROP
Josh spots something floating on the surface of the water

Fishing it out he realizes it is a clump of HAIR Curious
he flashes his light up the shaft

INT THE DROP
Crazy George has almost freed himself from the tangle As he
goes to cut the final strand of hairCRACK The rock ledge
supporting him suddenly crumbles
SHNICK His knife SLICES clean through the descent rope
Crazy George starts to fall his hands scrambling to find
purchase his fingernails SCRAPING the rock until
CRAZY GEORGE

Josh gazes up in horror as the rope coils into the water
around him

INT THE DROP

Victoria feels the rope go slack She shouts down the drop

VICTORIA

Crazy George shakes his head at the irony

CRAZY GEORGE
No shit Im off rope

A SHOUT from below

JOSH (0S)

Victoria leans over the edge and sees Crazy George clinging
to the ledge far below The severed rope hangs several feet
above his head No way he can reach it

VICTORIA (TO CARL)
Fetch the rope Quickly

Carl scrambles toward the EQUIPMENT PACK As he tears through
it a dreadful realization hits him

CARL
Frank has the rope bag

Crazy George’s hand SHAKES uncontrollably as he tries to pull
himself back up Its impossible He peers down and sees
Josh’s light far below him He closes his eyes in terror and
mumbles a quiet PRAYER
EXT BELOW THE DROP
Josh yells out into the darkness

JOSH
Dad Dad

No reply Josh’s eyes narrow in fierce determination He
steels himself grabs the end of the severed rope and ties it
to his harness

JOSH
Hold on Im coming up

VICTORIA (0S)
No Josh Stay where you are

Josh starts to free-climb the sheer walls of the shaft

cuUT TO
In a last desperate effort Crazy George swings his legs
toward a narrow crevice Transferring his body weight he
manages to unclip the carabiner supporting his REBREATHER It
falls away into the darkness below

CUT TO
Josh navigates his way up a vertical crack in the rock his

feet slipping on the treacherous walls of the shaft He leans
precariously toward a handhold just out of his reach

SMACK The rebreather smashes into him spinning him off the
wall Josh starts to fall Lightning reflexes as Josh manages
to grab a narrow ledge The rebreather SMASHES apart on the
rocks below Josh spots a ledge on the opposite side of the
shaft and LEAPS toward it just managing to cling on
JOSH (GASPING)

This is tough enough without you

throwing things at me
A voice from below

FRANK
Josh Theres a ledge to your left

Josh gazes down at his fathers light far below him Then he
starts to climb

CUT TO

Victoria and Carl can see Josh edging his way up the walls
toward Crazy George

VICTORIA
Hes nearly there Hold on

CUT TO
Crazy Georges grip is finally about to give way

CRAZY GEORGE
I-I cant hold on

JOSH
Two more seconds while I rebelay

Crazy George peers down and sees Josh HAMMERING a BOLT into
the smooth cliff wall several feet below him

CRAZY GEORGE
Im slipping

FRANK (0S)
No Josh is right beneath you

JOSH
Below

Josh lets the hammer fall into the darkness

CUT TO

Frank leaps to one side as the hammer SPLASHES into the
water He gazes up at Josh flinching with every movement the
boy makes

CUT TO

Josh CLIPS his COWS TAIL into the BOLT then reaches out
toward Crazy George Crazy George swings tantalizingly out of
his reach Adjusting his footing he leans out further

JOSH
(continuing)
I-Ivegot you

Josh grabs Crazy Georges harness Just as George’s grip
gives way

CRAZY GEORGE
Ahhhhh

Crazy George tumbles away into the darkness taking Josh with
him Josh keeps a firm grip on George’s harness and after a
few feetTWANG His COWS TAIL snaps taut SLAMMING them
both violently against the walls of the shaft

CRAZY GEORGE
Gnnn

Crazy George spins inverted Josh clutching his harness He
looks up at him clearly terrified

JOSH
Pass your safety

Crazy George’s hand shakes as he reaches below him and grabs
his cows TAIL

JOSH (CONTD)
(continuing)
Now pull yourself back up Quickly

Crazy George slowly inches the rope toward Joshs
outstretched fingers Josh finally grabs his carabiner
andCLICK Snaps him into his own harness

With a GRUNT of relief Josh releases his grip They both
swing free hanging suspended in mid air BREATHLESS and
exhausted

CRAZY GEORGE (SMILING GRATEFULLY)
And I thought they called me crazy

Josh threads the severed rope into the bolt and rappels down
with George dangling below

INT BELOW THE DROP

Frank is performing a full NEUROLOGICAL EXAM on Crazy George
who is breathing oxygen from Franks REBREATHER His own
REBREATHER lays smashed on the rocks around him Crazy George
is having trouble focussing on Frank’s finger as he waves it
in front of his face Josh watches from a few feet away
supervising the rope as the others rappel down

FRANK (TO JOSH)
See how his left eye is tracking
much slower than the right

Josh nods his head

FRANK
Helium bubble Wedged in his spine
(to George) You’ve bent yourself
good and proper this time

Crazy George takes the MOUTHPIECE out and pats the OXYGEN
CYLINDER in the REBREATHER

CRAZY GEORGE
Ah quit worrying Couple more
hours of this shit and I’1l be
right as rain (beat) Just remind
me not to smoke

FRANK (SMILING)
Soon as we find some deep water
well recompress you

CRAZY GEORGE
(beat) That was a hell of a thing
your boy just did Frank
Frank walks over to Josh and places a hand on his shoulder

FRANK
Yeah It was

Josh cant believe it A compliment From Frank Frank

shoulders one of the REBREATHERS and wades out into the
darkness He pauses below the drop and gazes up

FRANK (WITH A WINK TO GEORGE)
Course I’d have stuck to the left-
hand side of the shaft Much better
hand-holds

Josh and Crazy George exchange a look Josh rolls his eyes

INT RIVER TUNNEL

The deafening ROAR of a waterfall can be heard close by
Frank and Josh are busy rigging the easiest route downstream
Josh looks back to see Crazy George staggering through the
waist-deep water

JOSH (CONCERNED)
What’s gonna happen if he can’t
walk any more

FRANK (DEADLY SERIOUS)
Ill have to kill hin

Josh looks shocked Then realizes Frank is joking Frank
casts an admiring glance back toward Crazy George Badly
injured yet still helping Victoria navigate the river

FRANK
(laughing)
Well stick the poor bugger on
oxygen at 10 meters He’ll be right
as rain

They walk on for a few paces
JOSH
You think we could do something
safer next year Like climb the
North face of the Eiger
FRANK (GRINNING)
Yeah sure I reckon I owe you
that (beat) No ropes though
Josh walks on Frank watches him for a few seconds
FRANK
I havent been the greatest father
Josh I realize that

Josh stops in his tracks

FRANK
I guess I just got too hooked into
all of this

Josh turns and stares at him

FRANK
But it was never really about
exploration This place is my
church

Frank gazes reverently around the cave

FRANK
My sanctum The only place I get to
hold a mirror to my soul
(beat) I do this because I have to

JOSH (BITTER)
Yeah (beat) Must be real nice for
you

Josh walks off Frank sags visibly as he is overcome with an
enormous sense of guilt and loss He reaches out and grabs
the cold cave walls for support Then gazes sadly after his
son

INT WATERFALLS

The river suddenly disappears over a series of three
waterfalls A steep cliff borders the edge of the falls no
easy way down A thick MIST fills the air Frank has to SHOUT
to be heard above the ROAR of water

FRANK
Reckon you can find the way down

JOSH
Piece of piss

Frank flashes him a disapproving look

JOSH (WEARILY)
Ill be careful

FRANK
Well rig the zip line

Frank wades back over to the shallows at the edge of the
falls and pulls a 50 METER ROPE out of the equipment bag

Victoria sits on a rock a few feet away SHIVERING
uncontrollably Shes helping Crazy George keep his
MOUTHPIECE in place

Franks eyes register concern Crazy George’s condition has
worsened considerably He’s turning blue and his facial
muscles now droop like a stroke victim

FRANK
(continuing)
How you doing tough guy
George weakly flashes him an okay signal
FRANK (POINTING)
(continuing)
Looks like there’s a deep pool
below the falls Hang in there
Wont be long now
cuT TO

On the far side of the river Josh navigates his way down the
treacherous rocks lining the falls Its a torturous descent

CUT TO
Frank and Carl brace themselves against the flow and wade
toward a rocky island that sits midstream above the
waterfall

FRANK
Pass the cams

Frank slips a large CAM into a crack in the ceiling while
Carl prepares the drop rope

CUT TO
Josh arrives at the pool below the last waterfall it’s deep
and crystal clear Josh quickly fixes a CAM into the wall and
flashes his light up toward Frank

CUT TO

Frank receives the signal and throws the rope far over the
falls Josh grabs the rope as it floats past him He secures
it to the CAM and ties it off

CUT TO

Carl and Frank HEAVE on the rope The rope tightens forming
a ZIP LINE above the three waterfalls

CARL (TO FRANK)
I have it Start sending the
equipment down

Frank clips the REBREATHERS and EQUIPMENT BAGS to the rope
The first REBREATHER is launched over the waterfall and ZIPS
down the line SPLASHING into the plunge pool beside Josh
Another REBREATHER zooms down the line seconds later The
EQUIPMENT BAGS soon follow

FRANK

Victoria helps Crazy George to his feet They stagger
forward

lurches toward the edge of the falls

His world continues to kaleidoscope untilSPLASH Crazy
George faceplants the water and is washed toward the edge of
the falls Victoria is dragged into the water with him

CARL (POINTING)
Frank

Frank leaps into the water As Crazy George sweeps by Frank
grabs him and heaves him toward a BOULDER midstream Crazy
George clings weakly to the bouider as Frank flashes his
light around looking for Victoria

CARL
Over there

Victoria is clinging to a rock at the edge of the falls
buffeted by the cascade of water Frank wades out toward her
bracing himself against the ferocious flow He manages to
grab her SAFETY ROPE just as her grip gives way

Victoria disappears over the edge of the falls She hangs
inverted from her harness engulfed by the torrent of water
that pounds her against the rock Frank struggles to keep
hold of her safety rope

CUT TO

At the bottom of the falls Josh is about to unclip the
REBREATHERS from the rope when he hears Victoria SCREAM Josh
races back up the waterfall

CUT TO

Frank is slowly being dragged over the edge of the falls his
hands and feet scrambling to find purchase Carl releases the
ZIP LINE and staggers over to help them

FRANK (TO CARL)
No Stay on the rope

Carl turns back but it’s too late TWANG The ZIP LINE
whiplashes through the ANCHOR BOLT and disappears downstream

cur TO

Josh is climbing the waterfall below Victoria when he sees
the ZIP LINE suddenly go limp A glance downstream confirms
his worst fear the two REBREATHERS clipped to the end of the
rope are being washed away A shout from above

FRANK Josh Grab the rope We’re losing
the equipment

Josh spots the rope in the pool below him It’s slowly being
washed downstream Josh glances up at Victoria still hanging
inverted fifty feet above him He deliberates does he help
Victoria or save the equipment

Josh makes his decision He continues to climb up toward
Victoria

CUT TO

Frank CURSES in despair as both REBREATHERS disappear
downstream

FRANK
Josh Goddamn it

cuT TO
POV Victoria Through the savage jets of water she can see
Josh’s light approaching from below She manages to pull her
head out of the ferocious flow and into an airspace behind
the waterfall Gasping for breath she calls down to Josh

VICTORIA (HALF DROWNING)
Josh No

Josh draws level with Victoria He edges his way toward her
clinging perilously to a narrow ledge behind the falls Water
pounds his body His foot slips and he only just manages to
save himself Josh glances down fearfully at the rocks fifty
feet below him

Victoria pulls her head back up toward Frank COUGHING and
SPLUTTERING as the water pounds her face

VICTORIA (PLEADING)
Frank Let me go

Frank gazes down at Victoria a cold look on his face Carl’s
grip tightens on the rope

CARL
No We have to save her

Victoria SCREAMS at the top of her lungs as she sees Joshs
light edging it’s way toward her Frank spots it too

VICTORIA (TO FRANK)
Ygot toet me go Frank
You‘lllose us both
TIGHT on Frank as he coldly accepts her decision
CUT TO
Victoria swings her head back into the airspace behind the
falls Josh has reached the point of no return He’s reaching
precariously toward Victoria Eye contact is made

JOSH

Frank releases the rope It is violently ripped from Carls
hands and disappears over the falls

cuT TO
Josh is left staring at the space where Victoria used to be

JOSH
Nooooocccco

CUT TO
Victoria plunges 50 feet into the ‘washing machine a

ROARING cascade below the falls Buffeted from all sides she
is unceremoniously spat over the second waterfall

BLAM She hits the water hard and is immediately dragged down
by the cascade of water CRACK Her head dashes against a
rock below the surface Blood clouds the water

BADOOSH Victoria is thrown over the second waterfall and
dragged below again

Beneath the water Victoria struggles weakly toward the
surface but cannot move Looking down she sees her SAFETY
ROPE has jammed between two rocks trapping her underwater

A wave of euphoria washes over her as her hypoxic brain
starts to shut down Victoria desperately tugs on the rope
weaker and weaker until BLIP A final cloud of bubbles is
exhaled

CUT TO

Josh is slipping and sliding his way back down the rocks
toward the bottom of the falls

JOSH
Victoria Victoria

He reaches the final 30ft drop His flashlight reflects off
Victorias body beneath the surface There is no quick way
down

SPLOOSH Josh leaps off the cliff into the pool below His
light flicks through the water to reveal Victoria’s lifeless
body floating a few feet away
She is suspended in mid-water hanging by her safety rope
Josh tries to swim toward him but the current is too strong
He claws his way across the bottom RAGING in anger and
frustration With a CRY of despair Josh is forced to
release himself He floats back to the surface

DISSOLVE TO
A DREAM-LIKE SEQUENCE as the team react to Victoria’s death

Carl is hysterical Sobbing uncontrollably Punching the
water in anger and frustration and CURSING Frank

Crazy George looks utterly defeated He crawls weakly to the
edge of the river and collapses next to Frank

Frank gazes down at Josh from the top of the falls

Josh drags himself out of the water and clings to a rock
GASPING for breath He stares up at his father A murderous
hatred in his eyes

DISSOLVE TO

INT RIVER RAPIDS

VARIOUS SHOTS as the team stumble their way downstream
following the raging river

Frank leads the way A grim look on his face as he navigates
the best way downstream He is wearing the last remaining
REBREATHER

Carl flashes his light back toward Crazy George and Josh He
considers returning to help them but is too exhausted He
staggers downstream past Frank his face set in stone

Crazy George is in a bad way Josh has to support him as he
stumbles across the rocks Frank waits for them

Frank helps drag Crazy George across a set of rapids He
reaches back to offer Josh a helping hand Josh refuses A
moment of tension as they confront each other Josh pushes
past him into the darkness

Four lights continuing steadily downstream until finally

INT SUMP BELOW CHIMNEY

The tunnel ends abruptly at another sump a shallow pool
where the river disappears beneath a cliff A small entrance
beneath the surface marks the continuation of the underwater
cave The team wearily pull themselves out of the water and
crawl up the muddy shoreline

Everyone is physically and emotionally exhausted A depressed
silence engulfs the group Josh gently eases Crazy George to
the floor Crazy George curls himself up in a ball feverish
and MOANING in pain Josh lifts his head clear of the mud

JOSH (ANGRY TO FRANK)
He can’t go any further He needs
oxygen Goddamn it

Frank lifts the REBREATHER off his back and shoots Josh an
accusing look

FRANK
I already told you This is all we
have left Now

JOSH (BRISTLING)
What’s that supposed to mean

FRANK
(beat) It means we need it to get
out

Frank flashes his light around A dry tunnel leads upwards

FRANK
Up there We’ll be safe up there

JOSH
From what A nuclear fucking
attack

CARL (EXCITED)
Over here

Frank staggers forward Carl’s light has revealed several
FOOTPRINTS in the entrance to the tunnel Carl begins to SOB
with relief and excitement

CARL
Footprints This must be the way
out

JOSH

A-Are you sure
Carl races back and starts shaking Josh
CARL
We’re getting out of here You
hear We’re gonna live

Carl staggers drunkenly back up into the tunnel

CARL
Oh thank-you Thank-you Jesus thank-
you thank-you thank-you

Frank continues to examine the footprints a grim look on his
face

JOSH (TO FRANK)

You look disappointed Pissed off
someone beat you to it

Frank glares at Josh Then turns his attention to Crazy
George

FRANK
Help me get him somewhere dry

Frank hauls Crazy George to his feet He gazes at Frank ina
half-conscious daze

CRAZY GEORGE
S-Sorry to be such a b-burden
Frank

Frank smiles sadly at his old friend

INT CHIMNEY

Frank and Josh drag Crazy George up the narrow tunnel The
river has become a DISTANT ROAR below them They stagger out
of the tunnel and emerge inside a tall dry chimney-like
room

Carl is kneeling in the center of the Chimney Josh staggers
forward flashing his light around the walls

CARL
Don’t bother There’s no way out

JOSH
How can you be sure

Carl directs the beam of his light toward the back of the
cave

Josh reels in horror The skeletal remains of TWO DIVERS lay
on the floor their bones held together by their WETSUITS

The bodies are arranged to suggest a violent struggle took
place DRIED BLOOD stains the wall and floor One of the
diver’s skulls has been SMASHED apart by the others STAGE
CYLINDER

CARL (RESIGNED)

Frank is on the far side of the cavern busy checking over
the remaining REBREATHER His FLASHLIGHT casts ghostly
shadows over the cavern walls

Crazy George lays in Joshs arms MOANING in a feverish
sleep Carl glances down at his cracked TAG HEUER DIVE WATCH
Broken now

JOSH
Why’d you keep looking at that

CARL
Im wondering when it stopped

JOSH
Its been four days now Itll just
be getting dark outside

CARL
I should be flying home right now

Josh and Carl hear the faint wisps of COLERIDGE echoing
around the cave

CARL (URGENT WHISPER)
He’s out of his mind Josh
Just listen to him We should
have checked out those
tunnels We could have been
out of here by now instead
of being forced on some
suicide mission

FRANK (0OS WHISPERED)
In Xanadudid Kubla Khan

JOSH
He’s convinced theres dry
cave on the other side of the
sump

FRANK (0S WHISPERED)

TIGHT on Carl he can’t take his eyes off the remaining
REBREATHER

FADE TO BLACK

concerned look on his face

INT SUMP BELOW CHIMNEY

Frank and Josh stand by the water The last REBREATHER is
missing No sign of Carl

FRANK

JOSH
Maybe hes scouting ahead

Frank flashes him a look
JOSH

have to head back

FRANK
Either way we lose

JOSH
What are we going to do

Frank gazes around the cave Then marches back up to Chimney

FRANK
We find another way out

INT CHIMNEY

Frank sits in a depressed trance CLICKING his fading
FLASHLIGHT on and off repeatedly as he stares at the SKELETAL
REMAINS of the two divers

Josh watches him from a distance as he tends to Crazy George
Crazy George’s condition has worsened overnight He lays in
Joshs arms barely conscious

CRAZY GEORGE (DELIRIOUS)
F-Frank

JOSH
It’s Josh

Crazy George suddenly starts to CRY

CRAZY GEORGE
I-I can’t move my legs anymore

Josh says nothing He glances over at his father

CUT TO
Suddenly Franks eyes narrow as he notices something unusual
about the SKELETONS Scrambling like a crab he clambers over
the rocks to investigate

cuT TO
Josh scrutinizes Frank’s unusual behavior from a distance

CRAZY GEORGE (SCARED WHISPER)
L-Luko was here Last night I

reckon he came for me Josh

JOSH
Dont talk like that Try and rest

Crazy George suddenly grabs Josh

CRAZY GEORGE
Don’t let themcome for me Josh

JOSH

Crazy George points into the dark Macabre shadows dance
across the walls Sinister shapes Josh’s imagination prefers
to ignore Josh shudders

JOSH
Nothing’s going to hurt you I
promise

CUT TO

Crouching down Frank examines a curious DARK STAIN on one of
the SKULLS His fingers come away dirty He SNIFFS his
fingers and casts his beam toward the ceiling

CUT TO

Crazy George lapses into unconsciousness Josh checks to see
he is still breathing struggling to fight back his tears
Suddenly Frank looms over him a manic look on his face He
throws the SKULL down into Josh‘s lap Josh jumps

FRANK (INTENSE)

A Samurai prepares himself each day
for his own death Thats what
makes him invincible

Josh gazes up at him a worried expression on his face Frank
suddenly grins at him

FRANK

Cmon Were getting out of here
JOSH

H-How
FRANK

Well float up through the ceiling
Josh suddenly looks scared His father is clearly insane
Frank wipes the DARK STAIN off the skull with his finger and
waves it in front of Joshs face Josh wrinkles his nose

JOSH (DISGUSTED)
What the fuck is that

FRANK
Bat guano Follow me

CUT TO

Frank and Josh focus their beams high on the ceiling of
CHIMNEY

JOSH
Youre saying there’s a tunnel up
there

FRANK
Yeah Trust me

JOSH

Frank hands Josh a large BOULDER from the floor of the cave
Then grabs one for himself

FRANK
We don’t climb We float

INT SUMP BELOW CHIMNEY

Frank and Josh carry the boulders down toward the sump
BADOOSH Frank heaves his boulder into the water and watches
it sink toward the entrance of the underwater tunnel

JOSH
Youre going to dam the river

FRANK
We’ll flood the cavern The water
will carry us right up to the
ceiling

JOSH
That’1l take forever

Frank is already on his way back up to Chimney

FRANK
You got something better to do

SPLOSH Josh throws his rock into the water and reluctantly
trudges after his father

DISSOLVE TO

VARIOUS SHOTS as Frank and Josh carry rock after rock down
toward the river Its backbreaking work

Josh seems determined to select bigger rocks than Frank

WETSUITS are removed as the sweat starts to pour down their
bodies

Josh crawls over to check Crazy George’s condition

Frank collapses at the edge of the sump and starts GULPING
down the muddy water like a parched beast Josh gazes down at
him in revulsion

Frank gazes guiltily at Crazy George as he staggers past him
but he’s too focussed on the task at hand to stop

Frank and Josh are soon caked in mud They look like primal
beings barely human

Josh starts GULPING down the muddy water along with his
father

The pile of rocks continues to grown until

SPLOSH Josh tosses the last rock in place and collapses into
the mud next to Frank A massive pile of boulders now seals
the underwater cave

FRANK (GRIM SATISFACTION)
Its working

Frank shines his fading beam toward the shoreline The water
is already creeping up toward them Josh rolls over onto his
back and WHOOPS for joy

JOSH (LAUGHING)
Not bad(beat) For an old man

Frank’s face almost cracks a smile Almost Frank offers Josh
a shaky handshake Josh is about to grasp his hand when

BADOOSH The river SMASHES its way through the dam
scattering their efforts downstream Josh gazes in horror as
his world collapses

JOSH
No Nononononononono

Josh sags to the floor and starts to SOB Hes finally
reached his breaking point Frank gazes at the cave walls a
resigned look on his face Suddenly he bursts into HYSTERICAL
LAUGHTER Josh explodes into a fierce rage

JOSH
Goddamn you You made me believe

Josh starts hurling rock after rock at the uncaring cave

walls Frank can’t stop laughing Josh starts throwing stones
at him instead It only makes Frank laugh more

JOSH

Josh collapses onto the floor sobbing uncontrollably Frank
eventually calms down He approaches his son wiping the
tears from his eyes

FRANK
Cc’mon get up

Josh rolls onto his back and lies there GASPING for breath
Frank watches him dispassionately

Frank disappears into the darkness leaving Josh in the mud
After a few moments Josh starts CRYING Great wracking SOBS
shudder through his body leaving him a quivering mess
devoid of all humanity Josh closes his eyes

CUT TO

Josh open his eyes They are caked in mud tears and sweat
He sits up and gazes around him unsure of his surroundings

down to the sump

POV Josh the rock TRANSFORMS into a SCHOOL BOOK “DADS
DIVE” by Josh Mcguire aged seven A hand-drawn picture of a
diver with Frank’s NOTES scribbled in the margin

The COLERIDGE POEM becomes an annoying nursery rhyme
building in intensity over the following

Frank gazes up at Josh Josh lifts the rock and SMASHES it

into Frank’s face SPLOSH The water shatters as Franks
reflection disappears

Luko’s reflection appears in its place Then Victoria’s They

The dam is completed The water level has already risen
several feet and is working its way into the Chimney tunnel

Josh and Frank are unrecognizable covered from head to foot
in mud their fingers and faces cut and bloody

They collapse into each others arms sharing a significant
moment of accomplishment and achievement

Then they stagger back up toward Chimney

Frank nods and kneels next to his friend holding his hand
CRAZY GEORGE (SMILING)
Don’t look sosad JoshYou
can’tget burieddeeper
The sentence hangs in the air Crazy George is dead
A ROAR of water Frank turns and flashes his light towards
the tunnel The river is already pouring into the chimney In
seconds they are waist deep

Josh and Frank stand in silence and watch Crazy George’s body
disappear beneath the water

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE )
You have no control over this
Accept it

Frank and Josh stare long and hard at each other as the water
continues to rise

Then Frank starts grabbing their remaining items of DIVE
EQUIPMENT MASKS FINS

A wave of water hits them They start spinning around the
cavern carried higher up the walls

The ceiling suddenly looms close sure enough a small exit
tunnel can be seen above their heads

Frank reaches up and makes a grab for the ceiling He can’t
reach He tries again Fails

FRANK
It’s no good I-I can’t reach it

Suddenly Frank‘s FLASHLIGHT flickers and dies

FRANK
Pass me your light

As Josh passes Frank the final FLASHLIGHT Frank’s eyes
narrow in concern The dull beam reveals a black TIDAL MARK
around the walls of the chimney left by the falling water

FRANK (SCARED WHISPER)
The dam’s giving way

JOSH
H-How can you tell

FRANK
Tidal mark The waters dropping

The same thought crosses their minds at the same time they
reach up toward the ceiling It’s already further away
Suddenly a grotesque GURGLING SOUND fills the air In the
center of the Chimney a mass of floating debris suddenly
starts to spin

Josh sees it too a BLACK WHIRLPOOL is steadily forming
around them as the water subsides

FRANK
Quickly

Josh swims over to Frank who wedges himself into a crack in
the cave wall Josh clambers up onto his father’s body and
manages to grab an outcrop of rock on the ceiling

Clinging to the ceiling like Spiderman Josh inches his way
across the roof and up into the escape tunnel He reaches
down toward his father Frank is already fighting to stay
afloat as the whirlpool spins him around the cavern

Josh goes to grab his father Misses Grabs again Just
manages to clutch his hand Neither of them speak A simple
look indicates the sudden shift of power

Josh hauls his father up out of the water They gaze down as
the water in the chimney gets NOISILY flushed away

Then their final FLASHLIGHT flickers out Total darkness A
long unbearable silence

FRANK (DEADPAN)
Christ It’s blacker than the
inside of a dog

After a few seconds Josh starts to CHUCKLE at Frank’s line
Then he LAUGHS out loud This causes Frank to burst out
LAUGHING Their hysterical gales of laughter fill the cave
ECHOING off the walls

DISSOLVE TO

INT BATS BELFRY ENTRANCE TUNNEL

TIGHT on Josh’s face as he crawls along a narrow tunnel The
only light now comes from his cheap INDIGLO DIVE WATCH Josh
pauses and points his watch back down the tunnel Frank’s
face eventually appears in the dim BLUE GLOW

JOSH (PANTING)
Wewe canrest here There’s
not much battery left

Frank nods understanding The light snaps out Suddenly we
hear Frank SNIFFING the air

JOSH
What is it

FRANK
Fresh air

After a few seconds Josh realizes he can dimly see his
father

JOSH
Is thatdaylight

The sound of them both SCRABBLING forward in the dark
GLIMPSES of elbows hands then their faces appear as the
light in the tunnel grows steadily brighter

INT BATS BELFRY

Josh reaches a small body tube in the cave wall Dim light

can be seen through the tunnel Josh SHIVERS in delight as a
gust of wind HOWLS through the hole ruffling his hair Josh
closes his eyes and INHALES deeply He smiles at his Father

FRANK
After you son

Josh crawls into the hole

INT BATS BELFRY - DAY

Josh pulls himself out of the body tube and gazes in
disbelief

An enormous dome-shaped cavern the size of an Olympic
stadium Sunlight pours in through a skylight in the ceiling
200 feet above their heads A tantalizing glimpse of blue sky
as the Godly shafts of light pierce the gloom Swallows and
bats SWOOP around Josh dancing in and out of the sunlight

Josh flashes his light around the walls and ceiling they are
sheer smooth and impossible to climb

JOSH (DEVASTATED)
There’s no way out

Frank appears next to him He notices Josh’s expression of
bitter disappointment

FRANK
C’mon Let‘s check out the other
side

They stumble forward into the light
cuUT TO

Josh and Frank scramble up the pile of debris that’s formed
directly below the skylight As they clear the top they
freeze

A M4-A2 SHERMAN TANK lays at the bottom of the slope resting
on its side It’s covered in 60 years of bat guano but
otherwise it’s perfectly intact

FRANK
Now there’s something you don’t see
every day

They scramble down to investigate

FRANK
There was a tank battalion
stationed here during the
war (beat) We must be close to the
ocean

Josh glances up at the skylight far above them

JOSH
Christ D’you think anyone survived
the fall

Frank HEAVES open the turret hatch The SKELETAL REMAINS of a
crew member falls out The SKULL rolls toward Josh

FRANK
Guess not

Frank reaches inside the tank and pulls out a pack of
S-RATIONS He throws the pack to Josh with a big grin on his
face

FRANK
Hungry

cUT TO

A ROARING FIRE burns brightly in the center of the cavern
illuminating the walls and casting a cheery glow Frank
douses another FALLEN BRANCH with gasoline from the Tank’s
JERRY CAN and hurls it onto the flames WHOOMPTH

Josh sits on top of the tank wolfing down a bar of
CHOCOLATE He SIGHS at the indescribable pleasure of each
mouthful as he basks in the heat from the fire

JOSH (MOUTH FULL)
This Is Fucking Amazing

Josh glances up at the skylight Billowing smoke rises up
into the blue sky

JOSH
You think someone will see us

FRANK
Hope can be a dangerous thing We
find our own way out
Josh gazes at the cave walls

JOSH
It’s almost like it’s teasing us

FRANK
Caves do that

JOSH
Yeah This one’s really starting to
take the piss

FRANK
Dont take it personally We’re
here now And that’s all that
matters Until we accept that
were never getting out of here

INT BAT’S BELFRY - NIGHT

Darkness A dim BLUE LIGHT bathes Josh’s face He snaps awake
and gazes around him a confused look on his face

JOSH
D-Dad

FRANK
What

Josh spots the STARS and MOON shining down through the
skylight

JOSH
Nothing Just checking

Josh gazes up at the stars After a while he closes his eyes

INT SHINGLE SLOPE BAT‘S BELFRY - DAY

Joshs improvised TORCH splits the darkness Narrow strips of
uniform soaked in gasoline and wrapped around a RIFLE BUTT

Josh is searching the shadows at the far side of the cavern
Frank’s torch can be seen in the distance Early morning
sunlight pours down through the skylight Josh arrives at the
bottom of a steep shingle slope and scrambles up to
investigate

INT BELFRY EXIT TUNNEL

At the top of the slope Josh finds a small tunnel in the
cavern wall It leads steadily downwards

JOSH
Dad Over here

INT BODY TUBES

The tunnel soon narrows Sweat beads Josh’s brow as he
squeezes his way down the tight body tube The torch SINGES
his hair and almost burns his face

Josh turns back toward his father Frank is crawling through
the tunnel a few feet behind him

JOSH
Listen

INT CONNECTING SUMP

The sound of RUNNING WATER Joshs head pops out of a small
hole in the ceiling of a medium-sized cavern He throws his
torch to the floor before gracefully easing himself down

Josh stands on the shoreline of a small lake The river
GUSHES out of the deep pool and disappears down a half-
flooded tunnel Josh eagerly starts exploring the room while
Frank struggles to get down from the hole

CRUMP Frank enters the room far less gracefully than Josh

Josh’s torch reflects off an object laying on the muddy
shore Carl’s REBREATHER Josh bends down to inspect it Both
GAUGES read “EMPTY”

JOSH
Carls

Frank nods grimly Shining their torches ahead of them they
cautiously enter the tunnel

INT DEBRIS TUNNEL

Josh and Frank wade through the waist deep water following
the sluggish river Their torches reflect against the
obsidian black walls

Josh wrinkles his nose in disgust Floating in the water
around them are dozens of DROWNED RATS Josh pushes them
aside and continues onward

The tunnel becomes filled with debris that has been washed
down by the river TREE BRANCHES VEGETATION and the rotting
carcasses of several DEAD ANIMALS Josh starts recognizing
REBREATHER PARTS and DIVE EQUIPMENT smashed and broken along
the rocks lining the tunnel
INT DANTES NIGHTMARE

Rounding a corner the tunnel ends abruptly in a small room
filled with half-submerged rocks The rocks act as a drain
collecting any debris that’s been flushed into the cave Josh
covers his nose and fights the urge to retch the stinking
effluent has formed a festering lake A MOAN in the darkness
causes them to spin around

Carl sits SHIVERING in the darkness He is almost
unrecognizable his face is covered in blood mud and
bruises Madness rages in his eyes as he raises his hands to
protect himself from the harsh glare of their torches

Half-eaten RAT CARCASSES litter the shoreline around him A
pile of dead FLASHLIGHTS lay discarded at his side Carl
staggers toward them as if in a drunken stupor

CARL
Y-You came for me I-I knew you
would

Carl lifts his hand toward the torch and caresses the flame
CARL (HYPNOTISED)
Sobeautiful Beyond price I’d
have givenanything Everything
Just to see again
Josh pulls the flame away from him
CARL
H-How long have I been in the dark
A week A month
Frank and Josh exchange a glance

JOSH
You left us three days ago

Carl’s face registers confusion Then fear He slumps to the
floor and starts to CRY

CARL
Youhave to help me We have
tohelp each otherhelp each
other get out of here

Carl grabs Joshs leg Frank observes stony-faced

CARL
I only went toscout ahead Josh
I wasgoing to come back for you
But the current wastoo strong

Josh kicks Carl away from him

CARL
Youyou have to believe me Ask
the othersif you don’t believe
meask the others

JOSH
What others

CARL (MANIC WHISPER)
Them

Carl backs up against the cave wall SHIVERING in fear He
casts a terrified glance toward the far side of the cavern

CARL (TERRIFIED)
They’re hereAll of them

Following Carl’s gaze Josh and Frank shine their torches
into the dark reaches of the chamber

It’s a scene from Dante’s own nightmare

Scattered among the debris are the hideously mangled remains
of Judes Luko Crazy George and Victoria

The river has pummeled them into a twisted mass of skin and
bone Their lifeless eyes stare accusingly at them Carl lies
in the mud ranting at the darkness

CARL (MUTTERING INCOHERENTLY)
Nowwere all here I should
callthe office

Frank ignores Carl He wades toward Judes and starts tearing
her REBREATHER apart so he can salvage both her CYLINDERS

CARL
TellTell them were delayed You
brought the phone with you I have
a meeting in just over an hour We
should arrange a press conference
Send photos

Frank coldly sifts through Judes DIVE RIG He finds four
CYLUME CHEMICAL LIGHT STICKS tucked behind her WRIST SLATE

He coldly reads the words he had written onto her slate
“TRUST ME” Frank throws the LIGHT STICKS over to Josh

FRANK
Cmon We’re getting out of here

Carl crawls over to Josh and grabs his hand

CARL
Taketake me with you Please

Josh pulls his hand away
CARL
You are not to leave me here I
demand you take me with you

Josh and Frank cast a final glance down at Carl They look at
each other Then turn and walk down the tunnel

CARL (0S)

INT CONNECTING SUMP

Frank and Josh are kneeling by the shoreline fitting Judes
cylinders into the REBREATHER

FRANK
I reckon we’re only a couple of
miles from the ocean

Frank nods toward the water
FRANK
We can buddy breathe through the
sump Follow the river That will
lead us out

Suddenly a strange look crosses Frank’s face He glances
down in confusion and fear

JOSH
Are you okay

FRANK
Ohfuck

Josh reels back in horror The tip of a DIVE KNIFE is
sticking out of Frank’s ribcage Frank slumps to the floor

Carl kneels behind Frank holding the bloodied knife He lifts
it toward Josh’s throat

CARL
Give me those fucking lights

Carl grabs the CYLUME LIGHT STICKS off Josh

CARL
Wewe can still get out of
herealive Josh You and me Now
we have theseI want you to
fitfit the oxygen tank

Josh stares down at his father’s body in shock Carl pushes

the knife hard against Josh’s throat A sliver of BLOOD
appears

CARL (SCREAMING)
DO IT

Josh nods obediently He reaches down and grabs the OXYGEN

CYLINDER Lifts it into the REBREATHER

CARL (A GLANCE AT FRANK)
Thatson of a bitchhad it
coming Josh He’d havekilled us
all Even you You realize
thatdon’t you I was acting
inself defense

Josh slowly nods in agreement
CARL
Life’snot a dress rehearsal
Josh Sometimesyouyou have
to

Suddenly Frank MOANS Carl’‘s eyes narrow in concern He
lifts the BURNING TORCH to take a closer look

JOSH (COLD)
Seize the day

Josh cracks open the OXYGEN CYLINDER VALVE

WHOOOMPH A SHEET OF FLAME engulfs Carl Carl is on fire
reels backwards SCREAMING in pain

Carl flails around the cavern floor in agony his skin
blistering

FSHHHHHH A cloud of steam as Carl rolls into the sump to

douse the flames Carl surfaces gazing around in fear and

confusion just as

He

BADOOSH Josh leaps onto him in a primal brutal fury

VARIOUS QUICK CUTS as they roll through the muddy water
reduced to animals in pure savage survival mode

Biting Clawing Gouging Its ugly Visceral Almost
unbearable to watch

Carl sees the DIVE KNIFE laying in the mud where he dropped
it He crawls toward it Josh drags him deeper back into the
sump

Carl SCREAMS in fear clawing the mud He KICKS Josh in the
head Josh releases him

Carl grabs Josh by the throat and forces his head under the
water

SMACK Josh’s knee thuds up into Carl’s ribcage winding him

Carl slumps into the water GASPING for breath He turns
around just as

CRACK Josh smacks Carl in the face with the rock Carl drops
to the floor

Josh SCREAMS in rage as he leaps onto Carl and starts
pounding his head with the rock

JOSH
PUTYOURFUCKINGNAMEON
THIS

Suddenly blood spatters Josh’s face Josh gazes down in
horror and drops the rock He collapses to the ground and
crawls through the mud to check if Frank is still breathing

Josh starts RESCUE BREATHING Franks gaping chest wound
HISSES noisily with each breath Frank eventually COUGHS up
blood and opens his eyes Gritting his teeth in pain he
reaches toward Josh

FRANK
The-the rebreather

Josh glances toward the sump The REBREATHER is smouldering
by the water’s edge the oxygen cylinder still on fire Josh
shakes his head sadly

Frank MOANS in despair and pain Josh uses the knife to cut a

strip from his WETSUIT He starts padding Frank’s wound
Frank gazes toward Carl’s unconscious body

FRANK (IN PAIN)
Is hedead

JOSH
I-I dont think so

Frank suddenly grips Josh’s hand and looks him dead in the
eye

FRANK
Kill him Do it Quickly Before he
wakes up

Josh considers this Then heaves Frank toward the sump

JOSH
Let’s just get out of here

Josh pulls the DILUENT CYLINDER from the smouldering remains
of the REBREATHER and clips it onto his harness

FRANK
T-There’s not enough gas forboth
of us Take it Josh Leave me
andahhhhh

Frank cries out in pain and fear

JOSH (FIGHTING BACK TEARS)
I’m-I‘m not leaving you here Dad

Frank gazes around at the cave walls He’s suddenly fighting
for breath

FRANK
Listenlisten to meYou have
totrust me on this Trust the
cavefollow the river It’ll lead
you out

JOSH
Tt’ll lead us out

Josh drags Frank out into the water As he pulls Franks mask
into place a GROAN from the shadows causes Josh to look up

Carl is crawling through the mud toward the dying torch His
face is covered in blood and burns He reaches for the flame

Just as it flickers out
CARL

No Nocoooocce

Carl is plunged into eternal darkness

INT UNDERWATER CHAMBERS

An eerie YELLOW GLOW fills the underwater sump as Josh CRACKS
open a LIGHT STICK

Frank and Josh bounce their way down the underwater cliff
wall into the depths of the sump As they hit the sandy
bottom they see a small tunnel disappearing into the dark

PFFT Josh cracks open the DILUENT CYLINDER and snatches a
breath directly from the valve Bubbles EXPLODE and POP
around him He offers the cylinder to Frank cracking the
valve open so he can take a breath Then Josh grabs Frank’s
harness and pulls him into the tunnel

Josh swims directly above Frank orchestrating the task-
loading job of BUDDY-BREATHING from the DILUENT CYLINDER
while pulling them both along the wall

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE )
Open Breathe Close Pull Open
Breathe Close Pull Open
Breathe

After a while the routine becomes fluid like a beautifully
choreographed ballet Two people working as one

VARIOUS SHOTS The tunnel soon narrows into a tight
restriction Josh swims through then reaches back and pulls
Frank after him

A lazy current carries them down a widening passageway

They drift through a huge chamber spectacular speleothems
connecting the ceiling to the floor

Franks RATTLED BREATHING is growing steadily weaker as they
continue

Josh and Frank ascend up an underwater cliff wall
They surface inside a tiny air bell only six inches of
airspace Josh tilts his head back and gulps down several
DEEP BREATHS
JOSH (BREATHLESS)
YouYou got water in your
maskHerelet me

Josh removes Frank’s mask Frank lolls unconscious

JOSH
Dad Dad

Josh has to SHAKE his father back to consciousness Frank
blinks spits blood and gazes around weakly

JOSH
You gotta stay with me

FRANK (WEAK)
N-no more Please Leave me
hereIthurts so bad

Josh drags his father’s mask back in place

JOSH
Just hang on It can’t be much
further now

Josh CRACKS open another LIGHT STICK with his teeth They
descend

They enter another beautifully decorated room breaking
through the shimmering HALOCLINE from fresh water to salt
water

Josh glances up their exhalation bubbles break the glassy
surface of an air-filled chamber Josh kicks weakly toward
the surface

INT DRY CAVE

Josh drags Frank high up the shoreline and collapses into the
thick black clay covering the floor Josh gazes around
another vast and featureless air-filled cavern his LIGHT
STICK barely pierces the dark

JOSH
Hello

Josh sags wearily as his voice echoes into the far distance
The cavern is huge No obvious way forward Frank suddenly
COUGHS up more blood He’s struggling for breath and
SHIVERING in pain Josh gazes down at him numbly

Josh shuffles over and opens Frank’s WETSUIT ZIP to inspect
his chest wound His eyes widen in fear as he removes the
blood-soaked dressing Frank’s lost a lot of blood a red
river trickles down the shoreline Frank MOANS in pain

FRANK
J-Josh L-L-Leave me
JOSH
Shhh Easy now (obviously lying)
Can you feel it There’s a breeze
coming from somewhere We must be
close

Josh staggers to his feet He CRACKS the third CYLUME STICK
and hands Frank the old one

JOSH
I’m going to scout ahead (smiling
grimly) Don’t worry I won’t get
lost

Josh wades his way along the shoreline his feet SUCKING and
OOZING into the knee-deep clay After a hundred yards
something makes him stop and look back Josh suddenly looks
very frightened He retraces his footsteps to find

Frank has gone Josh follows the trail of blood down to the
waters edge

JOSH
Dad

Frank is laying with his face in the mud desperately trying
to suck water into his lungs in an attempt to kill himself
dosh races over and pulls Frank’s face clear of the water
Frank RAGES in anger and frustration as Josh drags him back
up the shoreline

FRANK
Unnng Goddamn it Kill me Do this
for me Josh Kill me Please
You have tohave to

Frank suddenly reaches up and touches Josh’s face

FRANK (INTENSE)
-Forgive me

JOSH
What for

Frank lapses into unconsciousness His head lolls against
Joshs knee only inches from the water Josh stares down at
his father shaking in fright

Suddenly Josh grabs Franks head and holds it above the
water

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
Do it Do it Do it

Josh stares at his hand transfixed as it inches Frank’s
mouth down into the water The water is about to cover
Frank’s nose when

Josh pulls Frank’s head back up into his lap He throws back
his head and WEEPS openly cradling his father’s head in his
arms He can’t bring himself do it

DISSOLVE TO

LONG CONTINUOUS SHOT as we follow a set of muddy footprints
along the shoreline of the river Next to the footprints can
be seen the deep imprint of an object being dragged The
footprints go on for what seems like miles We hear a MANTRA
echoing across the distant walls Spoken lyrics from an old
song

JOSH (0S)
“Tt aint easyLivin’ free
Season ticket on a one-way
rideAskin’ Nothingleave me
beTakin’ everything in my
stride”ShitHowHow’s
the next bit go

We follow the footprints over a huge DEBRIS SLOPE Then down
the other side back into the river

JOSH “Don’t need reasonDon’t need
rhymeAin’t nothing that Id
rather do” Goddamn it Help me
outThis was yourstupid
song

Finally the dim yellow glow of Josh’s LIGHT STICK can be
seen in the distance Josh staggers along the knee-deep
river his father hoisted across his back in a firemans
carry The DILUENT CYLINDER drags in the water behind them
It’s backbreaking work

Josh is mumbling to himself close to a complete emotional
and physical breakdown The sound of a WATERFALL can be heard
directly ahead

JOSH “Going downParty timeMy
friends are going to be there
tooI’m on a”

Josh emerges into
INT CRYSTAL PALACE

A cavern of magnificent wonder and beauty The chamber is
finely decorated with millions of delicate CALCITE STRAWS
hanging from the ceiling Joshs LIGHT STICK reflects the
exquisite crystal formations that cover every inch of the
walls A fine mist fills the air

The river disappears into a vast circular pit in the floor of
the cave Around the pit several other rivers cascade out of
the cavern walls to form one great one big circular waterfall
plunging into infinity

JOSH (HUSHED WHISPER)
“Highway to hell”

Josh gently lowers his father to the edge of a shallow pool
Then stumbles to the edge of the precipice and gazes down He
throws his fading CYLUME STICK over the edge and watches it
disappear into the darkness

A bottomless pit No way down No tunnel leading on
Josh CRACKS open the final LIGHT STICK and falls to his
knees Josh smiles as he gazes around the cavern finally
accepting his reality His face reveals a peaceful reverence
Hes breathing the cave in Feeling it Finally getting it
DISSOLVE TO
Josh sits in a shallow pool overlooking the falls Frank is
cradled in Josh’s arms unconscious Josh gazes around at the

cavern Then leans over and kisses his father

Franks eyes flicker open He gazes up at Josh a serene look
on his face Frank closes his eyes Then nods once

Josh gently lowers his father’s head beneath the surface of
the water

There’s no panic No drama Josh watches his father die as if
it’s the most natural thing in the world After a few seconds
it’s over

JOSH (WHISPER)
I love you Dad

Josh closes his eyes Darkness engulfs us

DISSOLVE TO
Josh stands confidently at the edge of the cliff clutching
the DILUENT CYLINDER and the LIGHT STICK He turns and takes
a final look at his father’s body floating lifeless in the
pool Josh steels himself turns and steps out into the
darkness

INT FREE FALLING CLIFF

POV Josh staring at the yellow glow from the LIGHT STICK as
he falls through the darkness The occasional glimpse of the
CLIFF WALL and the WATERFALL flashing by The sinister HOWL
of wind as the air rushes past him

JOSH (INNER MONOLOGUE)
Here Now This is who I am Who
you made me

INT FINAL RIVER

BADOOSH Josh plunges into a deep pool of water at the base
of the falls He breaks the surface COUGHING and SPLUTTERING
before being whisked away by a fast flowing river

Boulders loom in the dark Josh steers himself around them as
best he can A cliff wall suddenly materializes The river is
being sucked underground at a ferocious rate Josh takes a
final deep BREATH just as

INT OCEAN TUNNEL

Josh is sucked down into the inky blackness He allows the
river to sweep him along CRUNCH He is slammed against the
side of the tunnel DING His DILUENT CYLINDER scrapes along
the ceiling CRACK His facemask shatters Josh rips it from
his face

Josh tumbles head over heels bouncing off the walls ona
roller-coaster ride into hell itself Josh grabs a desperate
BREATH from the DILUENT CYLINDER and waves his LIGHT STICK
around POV Josh in the dim beam he can see the hazy
outline of MARINE CORAL covering the tunnel suggesting he
may be close to the ocean wall

INT OCEAN ENTRANCE

The current suddenly subsides and Josh finds himself drifting
down a wide tunnel filled with beautiful CORAL SPONGES He
allows himself to be carried by the current He has a calm
look upon his face No fear at all

PFFFT Every few seconds he reaches down and takes another
BREATH from the DILUENT CYLINDER Bubbles dance and POP
against the ceiling of the tunnel PFFFTFFFFT
Suddenly the DILUENT CYLINDER is empty Josh smiles shrugs
and lets it fall

Inverting himself so he’s staring up at the ceiling Josh can
see BUBBLES from his previous exhalations forming a tiny AIR
POCKET in the ceiling of the cave He sees his hazy
reflection in the bubble Josh takes a SIP of air from the
bubble and watches it trickle further down the tunnel like
mercury

Josh follows the bubble gazing in wonder as it gets smaller
and smaller with each breath he takes His reflection
steadily reduces untilSHLOOP A final breathand the air
pocket has gone

Josh turns away from the ceiling A school of YELLOW-TAILED
JACKS suddenly darts into his light The fish CIRCLE him
becoming temporary escorts as they lead him further down the
tunnel

POV JOSH a DREAM-LIKE AURA clouds his vision slowing his
every movement He’s suffering from hypoxia severe lack of
oxygen His HEARTBEAT can be heard hammering in his chest

Josh’s vision finally starts to narrow Shapes WARP and SPIN
around him The sound of his HEARTBEAT grows steadily louder
until BLOOMPTH Josh exhales his final breath

Josh relaxes He releases the LIGHT STICK and watches it
float away into the darkness As he sinks to the floor of the
cave he is convinced he can see his father gazing at him
from the shadows

Josh reaches toward him

Then blackness engulfs him

INT SEA CAVE — DAY

Darkness The distant echo of waves SHUSHING against a shore
Another sound less defined The sound of CHILDREN’S
LAUGHTER

Suddenly a tiny shaft of brilliant white light pierces the
gloom The dime-sized beam tracks slowly across a rock and
illuminates Josh’s hand The light moves slowly up his arm
and across his chest until it finally caresses his face

Joshs eyes flicker open

Staring down at him is the smiling face of six-year old LOCAL
BOY wearing a SNORKEL MASK The boy LAUGHS and waves a YELLOW
TAILED SNAPPER in Josh’s face

LOCAL BOY (PIDGIN ENGLISH)
Yes Mista You wantem pem sum blue
fish Hem ee good tu-mahs

Josh slowly sits up He’s laying on the shoreline of a sea-
cave a dome-shaped room connected directly to the ocean via
a gaping underwater entrance Blue shafts of light from the
ocean flicker across the walls

Josh gazes up a skylight in the ceiling casts a brilliant
beam of sunlight down into the cave It’s stunningly
beautiful Josh smiles

The local boy takes Josh by the hand and leads him back into
the water Other children can be seen in the ocean entrance
SPEAR FISHING with snorkeling gear

The boy continues to LAUGH and CHATTER as he pulls Josh
across the surface toward the blue window

Josh ducks beneath the surface

EXT PAPUA NEW GUINEA COASTLINE - DAY

The glassy ocean is rent asunder as Josh breaks the surface
A LOCAL FISHERMAN gazes down at him from his DUGOUT CANOE a
surprised expression on his face

Josh gulps down a deep BREATH of air He throws back his head
and floats gazing up at the sun
