doesnt stop It only goes one way

gathered around a kind-looking MAN with bright blue eyes

Whats it going to cost me

LENNY COLE

First let me make clear how much we
can help you benefit from this deal
With out me it will take you five
to ten years to get the permission
to erect your arena

Second with Government policy as it

that youd ever get that consent

and building consent youd be paying
6 to 12 million without any real
guarantee of that result

see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and
sweat he seems unstoppable One Two gets confident and
starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on CHECHNYAN 2
is a good runner but not good enough Deep hate fills his
eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him CHECHNYAN 2 will
remember this man One Two is taking complete liberties he
almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
him and then he tears off the CHECHNYAN keeps coming

One Two sees in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
a distance its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
machine However hes moving and its moving faster than
One Two One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall the
moped gets nearer At least when he gets over the wall the
moped wont follow right One Twos over He can hear the
moped on the other side One Two looks over his shoulder he
can see the moped being lifted over the wall Oh shit
This is where One Twos zone comes into play He drifts
in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and
runs and runs Up down through and in
