EXT AIKEN MEMORIAL LIBRARY - DAY 1

The first few minutes of the morning darkness receding like
a curtain pulled back

Balancing a cardboard box on her hip is GAIL BISHOP mid 40s
black upright and unyielding
EXT BLODGETT HALL - DAY Al

She cuts across the courtyard flats sinking into dew-wet
grass

EXT MASTER’S HOUSE - DAY Bl

The Belleville Master’s House rises up before Gail like a
fortress She steadies herself before approaching it

She struggles a while with the lock almost as if someone is
blocking it from the other side Gail turns from the door
whipping her phone from her pocket
GAIL (ON PHONE)

Buildings and grounds Yes this

is Gail Bishop The lock’s

jammed Well of course I --
Exasperated Gail turns back

The door has been pushed open Beyond it lies an unlit chasm
She hangs up hesitating on the threshold of her new home

And steps forward into the darkness

EXT BELLEVILLE —- DAY 2

FRESHMEN COUNSELORS outfitted in Ancaster College t-shirts
scream their welcome as new FRESHMEN and PARENTS arrive

One wields a clipboard as she approaches JASMINE MOORE 17
black impatient for life

FRESHMAN COUNSELOR
We’ve got a live one

JASMINE
Barely After that flight

FRESHMAN COUNSELOR
Last name first name
Moore

Green Rev

JASMINE
Jasmine 1A
The Freshman Counselor’s finger traces the clipboard

FRESHMAN COUNSELOR
Alright you’re in room

She pauses when she sees the room number looking from the
page to Jasmine The Freshman Counselor turns the clipboard
to the other Counselors

FRESHMAN COUNSELOR (CONTD)
She got the room

The Counselors gather something sharp beneath their knowing
laughter Jasmine smiles hesitantly

JASMINE
What’s wrong

A glance is passed between the Counselors and then scattered
as their features reassemble in benign masks

FRESHMAN COUNSELOR
Welcome to Ancaster

She takes Jasmine’s bag

INT DORM ROOM - DAY 3
A dorm room door is decorated with photos of Jasmine and her
soon-to-be roommate It opens onto a corner room one end of
the ceiling slanted to accommodate the pitched roof

There’s space enough for two twin XL beds one lies under the
angled ceiling The other has been claimed

Jasmine heads for the bed selected for her by default She
lies back on the mattress gingerly

Rafters criss cross the low ceiling that slopes overhead The
wood is rough and uneven She rises unsteadily to touch its
pocked surface

A sharp inhale at the door

Jasmine turns to see her new roommate AMELIA MILLER 18
white a conquistador in a strange new land

Amelia catches her breath explaining

AMELIA
You scared me

INT MASTER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 4

Living room furniture bulges under plastic sheeting Kneeling
on the hardwood floor Gail unpacks from a cardboard box

The muddy outline of a shoe mars the aged oak floors
Sighing Gail checks the underside of her shoes pausing when
she finds them dry

She glances around the room eyes catching on the stone gaze
of a MARBLE BUST distorted beneath a cloudy cover of plastic
She holds its stare before looking away

INT MASTERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 5

Gail tears off a ream of paper towels Somewhere nearby a
bell chimes

Gail follows the sound to a narrow staircase that leads
directly off the kitchen At the top of the flight is a door
left slightly ajar

Pushing aside her unease she climbs the stairs

INT MASTER’S HOUSE - MAID’S ROOM - DAY A5

A stuffy room lonely and claustrophobic crammed with the
boxed detritus of former masters

On the far wall hangs a row of BRASS BELLS Inscribed
underneath them are the names of different rooms of the house
-- Master Bedroom Dining Room Parlor

Gail studies the bells for a moment before stooping to gather
documents scattered on the floor The documents are aged and
fragile On top is an original blueprint for the home

Gail moves to place them in a cardboard box but pauses at
the sight of a photograph A black and white snapshot from
the 1950s it shows an unsmiling PAST MASTER and his family

It takes Gail several moments to notice the BLACK MAID at the
margins of the photo half hidden by darkness She is turning
her head at the moment of the photograph features lost in a
blur

INT BELLEVILLE - COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 6

Gail stands before the BELLEVILLE FRESHMEN gathered cross
legged on the floor like overgrown children
Green Rev GAIL
Legends Ancaster College is
crowded with them

(MORE)

3A
GAIL (CONTD)
When you go to a school nearly as
old as the country you’re bound to
hear a few Like maybe you’ve
heard that FDR was rejected by
Ancaster and had to settle for his
safety school Harvard

The Belleville Freshmen cheer

GAIL (CONTD)
While I can’t confirm that I can
say that two US presidents and a
small army of senators count this
school as their alma mater Or
maybe you’ve heard about Margaret
Millett a woman hanged for
witchcraft not too far from where
this building stands That part’s
true but believe me when I say the
only thing that will haunt you this
year is that extra slice of pizza

The Freshmen hang on her every word

GAIL (CONTD)
I consider it a huge honor to be
stepping into the role of
Belleville House master for the
first time As master I’m more
than just a professor -- consider
me a confidante an ally a friend
And if you need anything I live
right there --

She gestures

GAIL (CONTD)
So I’m easy to find And even
though it’s a new position for me
Id love to share some facts I’ve
picked up in my many years at
Ancaster

Gail counts off on her hand

GAIL (CONTD)
The best seat in the school is the
right corner carrel on the second
floor of the Aiken Memorial
Library Trust me on that As a
related point no one calls it the
Aiken Memorial Library For reasons
that will become clear you’1ll soon
know it as “The Ache”
2nd Blue Rev 5

Jasmine sits beside Amelia shimmering with excitement

GAIL (CONTD)

There’s a vending machine in the
basement of Belleville House Only
feed it coins We start and close
every semester with something
called the Primal Scream Get your
lungs ready now This year you’ll
fail at something Rejoice it
means you’re challenging yourself

Gail pauses glancing around the room

GAIL (CONTD)
And my last fact you’ll never go
back home again

Gail savors the quizzical silence

GAIL (CONTD)

Don’t get me wrong - Thanksgiving’s
in two months You’1ll be allowed to
leave But when you head back to
your hometowns over break it’1l be
as visitors There’s no returning
to what came before So for now
all I can say is welcome home

INT KATIE’S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 7
Pop music drones relentlessly

Jasmine sits amongst a small group of Amelia’s friends all
18 and white subtle variations on the same

KATIE FUCHS is a pint sized social operator while her
roommate CRESSIDA CARROLL-BLAKE lets her posh British accent
do the heavy lifting LIBBY NIELSEN drunk spills beer

CRESSIDA
Can someone clean that up The
kitchen roll’s over there

JASMINE
Wait so how do you guys all know
each other

Katie points to Amelia as she explains to Jasmine
KATIE

We went to the same school Libby
went to Dalton --
2nd Blue Rev LIBBY
What No I went to Dwight Dwight

5A
AMELIA
Libby’s my friend Camp
Chappaquiddick

KATIE
Oh Dwight Dumb White Idiots
Getting High Together

CRESSIDA
Can we keep on Never have I ever
joined the mile high club

Libby slurps her shot laughing It dribbles down her shirt
Amelia clocks that Katie has also downed a drink

AMELIA
Yeah right You weren’t like that

KATIE
It happened on Birthright

Cressida turns to Jasmine with the cool ease of one used to
giving commands

CRESSIDA
It’s her go

LIBBY
Yes girl Show us what you got

Jasmine is out of her depth

JASMINE
Never have I ever had sex

Incredulous the girls wait for her to continue

JASMINE (CONTD)
- in a hot tub

Disappointed the other girls take shots in quick succession
LIBBY
I have an actually good one Never

have I ever pissed my pants

CRESSIDA
Tonight’s not too late to start

The girls look in surprise as Jasmine throws back a shot
Amelia is mortified Jasmine laughs unembarrassed
2nd Blue Rev 7

JASMINE
Wait Listen I can explain So I
sleepwalk right Sometimes not
all the time

KATIE
Do you ever sleep eat

JASMINE
No I don’t think so So anyway
last spring I slept over at my
friend’s house after prom with a
bunch of people --

LIBBY
We had the sickest after prom
Amagansett

JASMINE
Usually I’11 sleepwalk if I’m
stressed or in a new place or
whatever So I guess that’s what
happened because the next thing I
know her mom is waking me up and
I’m sitting on top of their open
dryer no joke just peeing

Jasmine can barely get the words out around her laughter
It’s infectious spreading first to Cressida and then quickly
to the rest

JASMINE (CONTD)

So it’s like I didn’t just piss
my own pants I pissed everybodys
pants

Cressida surveys Jasmine appreciatively

CRESSIDA
Who found this girl

They are interrupted by a shriek from somewhere outside The
girls’ eyes shoot to the window wide with concern

Other voices add themselves to a chorus of screams

KATIE
The primal scream

Leaping to their feet with glee the girls race to the
window Jasmine reaches it first flinging it open as across
the school others do the same

They throw their heads back and wail

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 8
Warm afternoon sunlight seeps into the room

Gail poses for her official portrait perched delicately at
the edge of a chaise A PAINTER sketches her the sound of
graphite on canvas tickling the air

PAINTER
Congratulations

Gail struggles not to move as she speaks

GAIL
Thank you

PAINTER
I painted Dean Maroney when he
started as master of Peabody House
It’s a huge step

The trill of a bell sings softly somewhere in the next room
Gail jerks her head searching

PAINTER (CONTD)
Tired

GAIL
No I that sound --

PAINTER
This is a good place to stop
anyway We can pick back up next
week

As the Painter packs up Gail sneaks a look at the unfinished
work Only the faintest outline of Gail can be made out just
the trace of a faceless woman

EXT DINING HALL - NIGHT AQ
The Ancaster dining hall a modern structure made of glass
glows in the thick darkness

INT DINING HALL - NIGHT 9
The Ancaster dining hall is ornamented with a portrait of the

school’s founder Jasmine stares up at it mesmerized The
founder peers back imperiously
Buff Rev 8A

For one moment the portrait appears not as a man but
something demonic all waxen skin and bloodstained lips Her

head jerks in shock

A group of JOCKS swagger by one jostling Jasmine
A10

2nd Yellow Rev 9

Uneasily moving on she queues up for the hot meal where a
black DINING WORKER puts on a folksy act for the students

DINING WORKER
Don’t be shy now I know you can
do better than that Here you go
load up that plate now Mmhmm Now
were talking Alright now child
eat up

When Jasmine makes it to the front of the line the Dining
Worker’s expression slams shut

INT DORM ROOM - NIGHT Al10
Amelia and a group of UPPERCLASSMEN have commandeered the
dorm room and sprawl on both beds TYLER 21 defacto leader

tries to teach Amelia to blow smoke rings

As Jasmine lets herself into the room an Upperclassman moves
to hide their weed Amelia laughs

AMELIA
She’s not gonna do anything

With no room left on her bed Jasmine squeezes next to Tyler
who sizes her up approvingly

TYLER
Who are you

JASMINE
Guess

TYLER

Um Beyonce

Jasmine beams inwardly at the compliment though her glee is
cut short as Tyler rattles off the names of several more
famous black women who bear no resemblance to each other

TYLER (CONTD)
A Williams sister Venus and or
Serena No wait Megan the
Stallion

Jasmine watches in slight discomfort as the guessing game
spreads to the others NICKY jumps in

Nicky looks at Jasmine
NICKY

2nd Yellow Rev 10

TYLER
Seriously it’s real The Witch

Amelia flicks her middle finger

AMELIA

NICKY

Tyler focuses all his attention on Jasmine She listens
transfixed not sure if he’s flirting or serious

TYLER
I mean it doesn’t always work
People go nuts drop out withdraw
The lucky ones This girl my year
Treasure —-

NICKY
Holy shit I forgot about Treasure

TYLER
She lost it Jumped out the window

Tyler gives a pointed look out the window

JASMINE
What happens

TYLER
The Witch shows herself to one
person Chooses them And on
December 3rd - the day she died -
at 333 on the dot she takes them
with her

Jasmine looks on disturbed despite herself

JASMINE
Takes them where

TYLER
To hell

Jasmine surveys the laughing faces of the Upperclassmen from
behind the fog of her first smoked joint Bad vibes a-plenty

2nd Yellow Rev 10A

A sinister haze of weed smoke clouds the room Jasmine
stumbles through it maneuvering around Upperclassmen who
block the way

JASMINE
Excuse me Sorry ‘Scuse me

Amelia murmurs something to Tyler They both laugh

All INT BATHROOM - NIGHT All

Steam hangs thick clouding the long mirror Jasmine emerges
from the fog wrapped in a towel When she gets to the sinks
the lights cut out

JASMINE
Can you get the lights

SOMEONE is standing in the corner only the darkest outline
visible

JASMINE (CONTD)
Really fucking funny

Her eyes have adjusted enough to see a bit more of Someone
the white teeth of a wide smile

Irritated Jasmine stomps to the door and flips on the
lights stopping short to find the bathroom empty

A bathrobe hangs from a corner hook Jasmine stares long and
hard at it before accepting the explanation

Turning towards her bag of toiletries at the sink she spots
a note left nearby on the gleaming steel counter Its hurried
scribble reads Clean up DISGUSTING

Beside the note is a small clump of kinky hair

EXT SEMINAR ROOM - DAY Al2

ANCASTER STUDENTS hurry to class oblivious to the CUSTODIAL
STAFF MEMBER emptying a garbage can

They scamper by carelessly tossing garbage into the bagless
can as they go

INT SEMINAR ROOM - DAY 12

A freshman seminar led by LIV BECKMAN late 30s black with
pale skin she wears like a cross on her back

A dozen STUDENTS gather at a table Jasmine amongst them

LIV
Hawthorne went ham I think we can
all agree I mean just take a look
at Pearl This little girl is like
90 symbolism 10 precocious
statements

The Students chuckle Liv is the academic equivalent of the
“cool mom”

LIV (CONTD)
What do y’all make of her

The Students hang back loath to put themselves on the line
Jasmine tentatively raises her hand

JASMINE
Professor Beckman

LIV
Call me Liv And just chime in
Raising hands is for high school

JASMINE
Oh Sorry I think it’s kind of
ironic that Hester named her Pearl

LIV
How so

JASMINE
Pearls are associated with the
color white so we connect her with
purity innocence and all --
2nd Pink Rev 12A

LIV
Pearl should be read as innocent
because of her association with
white Who agrees

The Students are silent spineless bastards that they are
Jasmine begins to raise her hand again then drops it

JASMINE

Well Professor Beckman --
LIV

Liv
JASMINE

Um Liv I think at the time at
least the color white was
connected with purity
Symbolically But then there’s that
part where she’s like shouting at
the village kids in tongues So
obviously some of her behavior
isn’t supposed to be innocent

Jasmine gets a laugh from the room Cressida senses the
opportunity to play to Liv’s sympathies

CRESSIDA
Or that’s exactly the point and
Pearl is basically the white woman
come to bring Hester down Hester
representing all non-conforming
women of course

LIV
Brilliant Cressida Let’s go into
that some more

Cressida’s bluff has been called She deftly deflects

CRESSIDA
Id actually defer to Jasmine on
this one

JASMINE
I guess I think it doesn’t have to
be a contradiction Her hatefulness
is a kind of purity The Puritans
the hidden twisted way they lived -
- that’s what Pearl grew out of
Shes the truest expression of her
environment

Liv sizes Jasmine up like a worthwhile adversary
LIV
Alright let’s check out this
passage on page 103

INT MASTERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 15

Gail empties a bottle of Pinot Noir into Diandra’s glass
crimson specks sloshing out and freckling the counter

There’s one last sheet of paper towel She holds the paper to
the spill wine blooming on its white surface like a wound

When she lifts the glass she notices that it’s chipped

Searching the kitchen she is clearly unfamiliar with she
hunts through a cupboard under the sink Stiffening she
pulls out something a mammy cookie jar She holds it
uneasily in her hands

Liv steps out onto the porch hugging Gail

LIV (CONTD)
Girl you look like you’ve seen a
ghost Where were you

GAIL
I had the other masters over some
faculty too A small thing

LIV

GAIL
You’re right I’m overreacting I
just felt --

LIV

Like a house nigger
Gail recoils

GAIL
No That’s not

LIV
You think I don’t know Us sisters

GAIL
This is heaven The semester’s
barely started and I can’t get out
of Ancaster fast enough

Gail sighs relaxes
GAIL (CONTD)
I’ve been waiting all week for

this

Gail hands a glass of wine to MICHELLE BAIRD early 30s
white her casually rumpled style as studied as her politics

MICHELLE
The wine or me

Gail sniffs her glass

GAIL
Definitely not the wine

Michelle crawls over to Gail on the couch nuzzling her

MICHELLE
Babe that’s a really good wine
Plus it’s a woman run vineyard

Michelle plucks a wad of gum from her mouth and hands it off
to Gail in what is clearly a routine gesture

GAIL
I didn’t know I needed that

MICHELLE
You need that

Michelle resumes scrolling through her computer

MICHELLE (CONTD)

INT AIKEN MEMORIAL LIBRARY - CIRCULATION DESK - NIGHT 22

Jasmine glances nervously at a portrait of a solemn Puritan-
era woman labeled “Margaret Millett”

Pulling herself from the portrait’s glare she turns towards
a smiley LIBRARIAN who scans Jasmine’s books

JASMINE
Is that for the anniversary

LIBRARIAN
Clever girl We’re doing a whole
series on the witch trials ahead of
the anniversary on December 3rd

JASMINE
December 3rd I heard about that
They said she died at 333 in the
morning

Jasmine passes the Librarian her books

LIBRARIAN
According to the legend
Supposedly Margaret Millett was
about to be granted a stay of
execution by the governor of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony But
before that could happen the town
rushed her execution 333 AM

A chill passes over Jasmine The Librarian smiles brightly

LIBRARIAN (CONTD)
Anyway that’s all in the past

JASMINE
Right

The Librarian takes stock of Jasmine’s books
Cherry Rev LIBRARIAN
No procrastinating here I see
Youve clearly got a good head on
your shoulders

JASMINE
Figuratively maybe but dragging
these books around has completely
wrecked my posture and whole head
shoulder and neck alignment

LIBRARIAN
How funny Gosh you’re well
spoken Your family must be so
proud of you

Jasmine’s smile flickers as she crams the books into her bag

JASMINE
Have a good one

The security gate beeps when Jasmine goes through She turns
back to meet the uncomfortable expression of the Librarian

JASMINE (CONTD)
Ugh this happened last time too

LIBRARIAN
Could you come back and we’1ll
just We just have to be sure

Jasmine returns to the desk Embarrassment creeping over her
she passes the books to the Librarian to crosscheck them

JASMINE
Maybe I should take this as a sign

Jasmine forces a chuckle but the Librarian is wholly focused
on the books She checks the last one All clear

JASMINE (CONTD)
Yeah I don’t know what it is

The Librarian gestures to Jasmine’s backpack suspicion
narrowly edging out her extreme discomfort

LIBRARIAN
Can I just

Jasmine chews her lip as the Librarian paws through her
backpack searching thoroughly When her search turns up
empty she offers Jasmine an abashed grin

LIBRARIAN (CONTD)
Sorry we just --

INT BELLEVILLE HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT B23

Jasmine descends the stairs beneath Belleville’s giant
windows The building gives off a lonely and deserted
sensation

Reaching the second floor landing Jasmine continues towards
her room Behind her looms a darkened corridor with
intermittently flickering lights

A bizarre noise reverberates through the space - a
squelching stabbing sound

On high alert Jasmine turns

At the end of the dark hallway is a stooped squatting
SILHOUETTE its back to Jasmine Wielding some kind of long
weapon it jabs violently at something on the ground

Slowly it stands back hunched head down It moves backwards
towards Jasmine with jerky unnatural movements

Jasmine looks on frozen with terror a scream strangled
before it can leave her throat

Briefly flickering light illuminates the hood pulled over the
Silhouette’s misshapen form

Jasmine stumbles backwards several feet but can’t pull her
gaze The Silhouette is nearly upon her

Jasmine’s feet get tangled and she tumbles to the ground The
Silhouette turns to face Jasmine as she screams

Taken aback the Silhouette - a CUSTODIAL WORKER (black) -
brushes the hood from her head Pulling some airpods from her
ears she looks at Jasmine in equal fear and alarm

Jasmine begins to take in the scene The Custodial Worker in
an Ancaster hoodie the mop and bucket the glistening floor
the yellow caution sign she tripped over

Embarrassment floods Jasmine’s face

Cherry Rev 20aA
CUSTODIAL WORKER
My bad I didn’t even hear you
JASMINE
Sorry I just --

The Custodial Worker gives Jasmine a deferential nod before
awkardly moving on leaving Jasmine horrified and alone
INT DORM ROOM - NIGHT 24

Jasmine is fast asleep one arm flung over the edge of her
bed The sound of heavy breathing echoes through the room

Her digital clock ticks to 333 AM

It’s just possible to see a GNARLED HAND slowly reach from
under the bed and drag a jagged nail across Jasmine’s arm

Jasmine flinches shifting slightly
The pale hand extends again scratching harder this time

Jasmine is jerked from her sleep The breathing rattles on
She glances over at Amelia’s bed and finds it empty

Embarrassed Jasmine gets her bearings She slowly gets to
her feet looming over Amelia who uneasily draws back

Jasmine checks under the bed finding nothing

When she looks at her arm there are two bloody scratches

The room is empty save for a PASSED OUT PARTIER slumped on

Tyler pokes his head into the room and does a quick sweep
with his eyes Having found Jasmine he approaches her
casually

She jumps at the sensation of a hand on her back He lifts
his hands as if protesting innocence

She holds back for a second uncertain Then she leans into
the kiss hungry for affection belonging When she pulls
away she spots Amelia across the room hatred frankly
coloring her features

Moving at a dreamy pace Jasmine wanders the quad The
deserted college is eerily bereft of sound and people

Jasmine walks past a dormitory oblivious to the WOMEN who
peer at her from the windows as well as the SHADOW that
reaches a thin arm towards her as she trudges steadily into
the night

Jasmine observes her illuminated dorm room window

As she draws closer she detects what looks like a figure
standing in the window The HOODED WOMAN is silhouetted pale
features indistinguishable

Jasmine stops still paralyzed with fear The Hooded Woman
slowly extends her hand finger pointing at Jasmine

A faint knocking echoes Jasmine realizes with dread that the
Hooded Woman isn’t pointing at her but behind her

She turns to face a HANGING WOMAN dangling from a tree her
leather boots rhythmically knocking into its wood

The rhythmic knocking picks up in pace as Jasmine watches in
terror The sound of a throaty phlegmy laugh haunts the
courtyard

Jasmine looks to her bedroom window but the Hooded Woman is
gone Crimson blood trickles down the window pane

When she looks back at the tree an empty noose swings like a
pendulum

Before Jasmine can react the Hooded Woman appears out of the

darkness from behind Jasmine and zooms towards her Her pale
and rotting hand grabs Jasmine by the throat

Glimpses of the article paint the picture of the 1965 suicide
of a student named LOUISA WEEKS who died in a Belleville

sepia toned photograph is wedged inside Jasmine looks
uneasily at the portrait of Louisa Weeks

She sets the photo down and thumbs through the datebook The
early entries are packed with dates and short observations

“Lunch with Alice Tomato bisque - delicious”
“World Lit exam 96”

The entries become sparse with time One engagement is
crossed out the word “uninvited” written beneath it

Louisa’s handwriting grows sloppier A November entry simply
reads TIRED

WOMAN somewhere nearby her clear and resolute voice
punctuated by the beat of a shovel striking the earth

As darkness falls Gail spies the Singing Woman across the
cemetery She holds a lantern that illuminates her solemn
face and hand-sewn black dress Beside her is the bent form
of a GRAVEDIGGER

Gail strains to understand the unfamiliar tongue of Singing
Woman’s plaintive song

Gail goes ice cold with fear when around the cemetery
MOURNERS step forward the shivering flames of their lanterns
glowing like fireflies in the night

Gail sinks to the ground and presses herself against a
tombstone going unnoticed by the Mourners

Gail flinches with guilt

GAIL
Oh

The student actually escalated her
grade dispute into a faculty
conduct complaint

GAIL
What

LAM (ON PHONE)
I don’t know too much yet but it
has to do with race and the way
Liv’s handling it in class

Gail hangs up She takes a few deep breaths before quietly
pulling herself to her feet

Gail takes one last look at the Mourners before turning to go
and nearly colliding with -- the Singing Woman Gail draws
back fearfully not understanding how she can be in two
places at once Or is it a different woman

The Singing Woman smiles and gestures towards the group but
Gail is already stumbling away tripping over herself to get
as far away as possible

A guttural moan echoes somewhere in the night Gail pauses
ears pricked She glances around but finds nothing

As her eyes adjust she spies a pale figure writhing in the
darkness Gail can’t quite grasp what she’s seeing

She strains to listen but the woods have grown silent

Two WHITE MEN burst from the darkness Gail reels in fear as
they push past her shoes untied and loose belt buckles
singing to the night

GAIL
Hey

She watches as their silhouetted forms retreat

Looking back to where they came from Gail takes a tentative
step forward

She creeps onward not noticing Amelia until she’s nearly
upon her The freshman is huddled at the foot of a tree She
turns a mascara stained face towards Gail

to a faint whisper of what it was

Amelia heaves her suitcase upright

Jasmine keeps to her side of the narrow room as Amelia double
checks the closet and under the bed

A BLOND WOMAN has materialized in the doorway like an

A large yellow envelope is addressed to Jasmine in ornate
gothic calligraphy She digs it open

CRESSIDA

weren’t taking me to Dominica I
wouldn’t want to spend break with

Jasmine reaches her hand into the envelope and then yanks it
back out Cressida paws through her closet oblivious

Jasmine goes into the envelope once again pulling out thick
clumps of tightly coiled hair Jasmine stares in
incomprehension at the mass of dark hair in her hand

Cressida screams

CRESSIDA (CONTD)

The hair writhes as if alive A garter snake has emerged from
the depths of the hair and wound itself around Jasmine’s

ecstasy breath accelerating

Through her parted eyelashes Gail can make out the stern gaze
of a FORMER MASTER pictured in a black and white class photo
He seems to watch her from the corner of his eye

Gail looks back at the photo the Former Master is staring

system

Weeks haunting Louisa Weeks witch With mechanical
repetition she closes tab after tab

She pauses to flick dust from her screen instead smearing
blood across a webpage bearing am illustration of a gallows

Her laptop displays the time 333 AM

Jasmine checks her thumb the nail bitten down to the bloody
quick She puts it in her mouth and sucks

Closing her computer and gathering her things Jasmine stands
up to go We catch a brief glimpse of a HOODED WOMAN further
down the hall behind her

Before we start I have to say how
much I enjoyed your editorial The

LIV
Thank you Thanks so much

JULIANNE
Incredibly thought provoking

VICTOR
I think I read that you’ll be
leading an intracollege conference
next week
LIV
Yep Yeah At Amherst Title is
“Addressing Cultures of Violence in
Institutions Hostile to Modernizing
Demographics Pathways to Change”
Kind of a mouthful so if anyone
has any suggestions

Light chuckles from the group

LAM
Well we really do appreciate you
making yourself available
Obviously something like this is
rare but we felt it was the best
course forward in addressing the
portfolio

From Gail’s vantage point Liv looks pale fragile

LIV
Absolutely I appreciate the
opportunity to lend my voice to the
dialogue

DIANDRA
This editorial Will it lead to
further publishing on your part
Books I mean

LIV
Not in the immediate future I’m in
the early stages of the notes
collection process for --

DIANDRA
Published work obviously is only
one factor in tenure review
Usually in instances where
publishing is light an application
will lean more heavily on other
factors such as classroom
performance and engagement

LIV
Understood completely I place
classroom instruction above
everything else

DIANDRA
So you can understand why the
current dispute filed against you
is of particular concern

LIV
I well --

Has that reached a resolution

LIV
Not yet

Liv glances at Gail hoping for a lifeline

GAIL
Maybe you can expand a bit on the
substance of the issue

Liv flails for a good response After a long silence she
looks up cheeks flushed

LIV
The issue is this school

The committee members exchange a look

LIV (CONTD)
Why is the administration spending
more energy on undermining my
application for tenure than on
ferreting out the racist who’s
terrorizing the student body

DIANDRA
I don’t see how the two are --

LIV
Last week someone lit a cross on
fire This isn’t an incident it’s
an emergency

Liv presses on gaining strength with each word

I will not allow myself to be
scapegoated by a school that is
unable or unwilling to see itself
for what it truly is

The Academics are cowed uncertain of how to respond

Green Rev 67

If anyone really wanted to help
that girl it would be by ending
the culture of hatred that

The aged documents are once again on the floor As Gail puts
them away she notices her new portrait propped up on a stand
in a corner Gail processes the portrait with confusion
There’s something strange in her painted expression

It takes her a moment to see that the eyes are chewed out as
are a few other patches of the mottled moth bitten canvas

Gail leans in horrified as the portrait’s mouth twitches A
single moth crawls out from the canvas tensing its wings
before taking to the air

Gail touches the painting peeling a corner of the canvas
aside Moths and larvae pour from the portrait’s mouth Gail
recoils stumbling into the hanging bulb The bulb swings as

So you go back home and then what
Transfer to another college hoping
it’ll somehow be different

JASMINE
It’s that school It’s that room

Gail lectures Jasmine as if coaching herself

GAIL
It’s not I wish I could tell you
it was but it’s not It’s not
ghosts it’s not supernatural It’s
America and it’s everywhere So you
need to toughen up I know I went
through it I was one of three
black women in my whole class They
couldn’t tell us apart But I stuck
in there I didn’t let anyone push
me out

JASMINE
I just want to get away from there

GAIL
You can’t get away from it
Jasmine It will follow you

Jasmine blinks away tears

GAIL (CONTD)
Believe me I know

INT CAR - DAY

Liv’s voice is piped in over speakerphone as Gail drives back

to campus
Green Rev LIV
Holy shit A broken arm Is she
okay

GAIL
She will be We’re lucky it wasn’t
worse

LIV

What the hell’s in the air today
I’m saging my house later

GAIL
So the police checked everything
out

LIV (ON PHONE)
Yeah but they basically shrugged
No sign of forced entry nothing
taken I’1l change the locks just
in case

Gail shakes her head

LIV (ON PHONE) (CONTD)
Gail don’t get mad at me but do
you think --

GAIL
No

LIV (ON PHONE)
Listen you’re under pressure You
couldve misheard something or --

Gail clocks smoke pluming from the hood of the car

GAIL
Fuck Seriously Liv sorry my
car is -- I’1ll call you back okay

2nd Pink Rev 78

EXT RURAL ROAD - LATER 112

Gail pops the hood waving away billowing smoke Stepping
away from the car she dials AAA

The purring line competes with the clop of horse hooves Gail
looks down the road surprised to see a horse and buggy
slowly headed towards her

Gail waves but receives no response As the buggy nears
Gail observes uneasily that no one drives the empty carriage

She watches as the horse continues pulling the buggy to
destination unknown
INT OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT - NIGHT 113

The Comm Director frets over a printer that slowly spits out
a page while the DEAN OF STUDENTS paces texting wildly

Gail opens the door onto a room bubbling with barely
contained frenzy The Comm Director thrusts a sheath of pages
at Gail before she can even get her bearings

The College President tie loosened face flushed leaps up

COLLEGE PRESIDENT
Gail finally What took so long

GAIL
I can’t even begin to tell you

DEAN OF STUDENTS
How’s the girl

GAIL
Broken arm but she --
Unintelligible bleating comes from a desk phone

GAIL (CONTD)
Sorry what is that

COMM DIRECTOR
Rick from the Board of Trustees

The Comm Director turns to the phone

COMM DIRECTOR (CONTD)
Speak up Rick

RICK (ON SPEAKER)
We need to get out ahead of this
quick We’re in the heart of the
admissions cycle This could be
disastrous

COMM DIRECTOR
I’m working on a statement right
now We need to deemphasize the
student’s race and avoid connecting
it to the previous events

Something approaching hysteria grips the room

DEAN OF STUDENTS
Truthfully Gail this falls under
your responsibility This girl is a
Belleville resident she’s --

GAIL
This is the responsibility of the
police

COMM DIRECTOR
A police report in the news would
be fatal

The College President lifts a silencing hand

COLLEGE PRESIDENT
Everyone take a breath Racism has
no place at Ancaster So what we
need to do is find the person
behind all this and deal with them
swiftly

The others nod sagely

COLLEGE PRESIDENT (CONTD)
Gail we’re counting on you

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT 114
Jasmine sleeps bandaged arm awkwardly bent across her chest

A moan drifts over the air Jasmine stirs eyes fluttering
open She listens in dread to another other-worldly croak

Her eyes search the dimmed room finding only a muted
television

Turning with difficulty Jasmine studies the other side of
the room A curtain blocks her roommate MRS DENNIS from
view Jasmine can see her sitting upright in bed Without
warning the groaning resumes at a louder pitch

Jasmine watches as Mrs Dennis’ shadow begins rocking back
and forth slowly at first then picking up speed

JASMINE
Are you ok

The shadow stops moving and Jasmine watches uneasily as its
head turns slowly towards her

JASMINE (CONTD)
If you want I can call a nurse

Mrs Dennis’ voice is small and pitiful

MRS DENNIS
Help me

Jasmine pushes herself off the bed padding cautiously across
the room She hesitates before slowly pulling aside the
curtain Mrs Dennis is 80s white both child-like and
withered Her eyes search Jasmine

MRS DENNIS (CONTD)
Virgie

Blood seeps through the Mrs Dennis’ bandaged temple She
resumes rocking picking violently at her arm

MRS DENNIS (CONTD)
We’re too late They’re almost
here

JASMINE
Let me get someone

Jasmine rests a hand on Mrs Dennis’ shoulder Instantly
Mrs Dennis transforms face grotesque with hatred
Yellow Rev 81

MRS DENNIS
Get your black hands off of me

Jasmine yanks her hand back Her voice a hiss Mrs Dennis
continues her tirade

MRS DENNIS (CONTD)
You think you can touch me I let
you get too comfortable Gary
warned me about this

Mrs Dennis seems ready to spring at Jasmine who edges
backwards in terror

JASMINE
Someone help

An RN hurries into the room Mrs Dennis flips emotions
suddenly distraught Jasmine is pressed against the wall

RN
Is everything --

MRS DENNIS
Her smell is everywhere I can’t
get it out of my house

RN
Youre in the hospital Mrs
Dennis Why don’t I help you get
back in bed

The RN makes apologetic eye contact with Jasmine as she
settles the sobbing older woman back in bed

As she inches backwards Jasmine doesn’t move her eyes from
Mrs Dennis

MRS DENNIS
It’s not right It’s not right

Jasmine backs into her bed She watches as the RN comforts
Mrs Dennis the sound of her wails filling the room
INT MASTER’S OFFICE - DAY 115

Gail sits at her massive desk photographs and records of
Jasmine’s attacks assembled like a jigsaw puzzle

Liv lets herself in She holds out a cup of soup

LIV
How are you holding up
Green Rev 82

GAIL
I’m not

Liv perches on a corner of the desk gazing down on the
evidence Gail’s collected

LIV
Lord a mercy Look at this shit

She picks up the photo of Jasmine’s door her thumb tracing
the letters carved in the wood

LIV (CONTD)
How did those girls not notice this
as soon as they got home

GAIL
Amelia never went home And
Jasmine it happened while she
was sleeping

Liv gives the slightest indication of a frown before laying
down the yellow envelope Jasmine received in the mail She
freezes staring at it

Finally she speaks

LIV
Where’s the stamp
GAIL
What
LIV
This envelope -- is that the one

Jasmine got in the mail

GAIL
Yeah

LIV
Gail it doesn’t have a stamp How
did it end up in her mailbox

Gail looks in surprise at the envelope addressed in elaborate
and old fashioned penmanship It bears no stamp

LIV (CONTD)
Her roommate

GAIL
Every student gets their own
mailbox Their own key
Green Rev 82A

Gail grasps at a reasonable explanation
Green Rev 83

GAIL (CONTD)
I keep a master key in here It
opens all the mailboxes

LIV
Who would have access to that
beside you

GAIL
There’s got to be another way this
got there

LIV
What if she put it there herself

Gail studies the photograph the black void where a face
should be and the eerie minstrelsy of the hand drawn smile

LIV (CONTD)
Was anyone else in Belleville the
night of the fire

GAIL
She told me she saw the Witch

LIV
The Witch

Gail puts her head in her hands bent under the weight of
this new information

GAIL
She seemed so sure it was real
116 INT DINING HALL - NIGHT 116

Gail eats at a long dining table crowded in by STUDENTS on
either side

She eavesdrops on a nearby conversation

KATIE
literally sick to my stomach A
hoax Way to discredit real
suffering
A116

CRESSIDA
I’m not sure I believe it What I
can’t get is why

KATIE

I read that self-victimization is a
really big problem right now

INT CAR - DAY A116

Jasmine rides in the back of a taxi staring impassively out
the window as the landscape flies by

EXT QUAD - DAY 117

Liv bends against a gust of freezing wind leaning into the
frosty breeze as she crosses the quad

She stops suddenly surprised to see Jasmine

LIV
Jasmine

Jasmine turns Her coat is draped over her shoulders
accommodating her broken arm

LIV (CONTD)
Does Gail know you’re here Anyone
from the school

Jasmine shrugs

JASMINE
I came on my own

Liv sizes her up

LIV
What are you trying to do

JASMINE
I figured it out I understand now

Liv scans the quad then turns her attention back to Jasmine
LIV
I don’t think this is the right

place for you to be right now

JASMINE
You’re wrong
840A

Jasmine takes off addressing Liv over her shoulder

JASMINE (CONTD)
It doesn’t matter where I go It’s
everywhere

Yellow Rev 85

Liv watches as she recedes into the distance growing smaller
with each step
EXT QUAD - NIGHT A117

Gail makes her way back to Belleville moving slowly despite
the cold

The wind whistles through the trees that flank the courtyard
A faint cry adds itself to the chorus

The cry picks up in volume all along Belleville windows
fall open Students thrust their heads outside their dorms
and let loose with an unbridled scream

Gail stops in the middle of it all as the noise devours her
like a wave

EXT BELLEVILLE COURTYARD - NIGHT 118

When Gail opens her eyes she notices a steady light ina
familiar window and in its center a strange sight

Through the slanted blinds she can detect a silhouette To
Gail’s eyes it looks like a woman suspended in air

INT FRESHMAN CORRIDOR - NIGHT 119
Gail pushes a key into Jasmine’s dorm room door She pauses a
moment with her hand on the knob terrified to see what
awaits her on the other end

INT DORM ROOM - CONTINUOUS 120
Gail pushes the door open slowly staring blankly at what
lies ahead Then her face cracks and she doubles over arms
hugging her sides as if to hold herself together

Across the tiny room two feet dangle mid air stiffly
pointed downwards floating almost daintily

INT DORM ROOM - DAY 121
From behind Gail looks like she’s praying

Jasmine’s room is cleared out Kneeling on the bedroom floor
Gail is bent over a cardboard box Treating each item with a

delicate reverence she packs Jasmine’s clothes She folds
and refolds a shirt until she gets it just so
Yellow Rev 85A

Closing the box Gail tapes it shut It is addressed to the
Tacoma home of Carol Moore
A122

Salmon Rev 86

Gail moves to the next box carefully loading Jasmine’s
schoolwork and books Louisa Weeks’ journal goes in amongst
other notebooks its significance lost on Gail

Gail picks up a high school yearbook and opens to the front
page It is littered with inscriptions from friends excited
for the summer and all that lies ahead

Gail reads them tears dropping onto the page She takes a
deep breath and closes the box alone in the empty room
EXT BELLEVILLE HOUSE - NIGHT A122

MOURNERS ferry candles in a somber vigil

Faces lit by the flickering light they deposit the candles
at the foot of a memorial to Jasmine

The College President and Dean of Students are unnerved and
eager to leave Katie and Cressida are red-eyed and
disbelieving

Liv appears blank elsewhere as she leaves her candle
behind Gail watches her with surprise

Feeling Gail’s gaze Liv turns towards her Emotion floods
her face features crumpling into the picture of sorrow
INT MASTERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 123

Huddled on the sofa Gail hugs her knees to her chest Liv
watches her nervously

LIV
You look like you haven’t been
sleeping

GAIL

How can I

Liv searches gingerly for the right words

LIV
It wasn’t your fault I mean
obviously but -- don’t blame
yourself

GAIL

I didn’t listen to her I didn’t
listen to what she was really
saying

LIV
Gail how could you know There was
so much going on with her that we
didn’t realize

GAIL
Why did you do it

Liv’s face grows serious

LIV
Do what

GAIL
You told someone You told someone
about the envelope that she was
behind everything How did anyone
find out

LIV
I didn’t think It came out by
accident I --

Gail snarls finger pointed

GAIL
You had no business doing that

Liv withdraws startled Gail presses a palm to her face

GAIL (CONTD)
I’m sorry Fuck I don’t know why
I’m blaming you I don’t even know
what I’m feeling anymore

LIV
I get it Look I’m here for you

GAIL
I know it’s been hard for you too
And at a time when normally wed be
celebrating You did it Tenure

Gail lifts a mug Liv clinks her mug against Gail’s

LIV
Tenure

Liv shakes her head
LIV (CONTD)

I don’t think they had the stomach
for any more scandal

Gail stares into her tea

GAIL
I started to believe her

Liv watches Gail closely

GAIL (CONTD)
It’s crazy but I started to wonder
if this place could be haunted

Liv exhales

LIV
Jesus

GAIL
I always thought this was the
prize Sticking it out and
surviving Enduring But what if I
fooled myself What are we doing
this for

Liv turns Gail’s words over in her head as if tasting them

LIV
I know what I’m doing this for

Gail looks at her surprised

LIV (CONTD)
I belong now I have a place Maybe
belonging is something youve
always had Well I didn’t

Liv grasps Gail’s arm for emphasis

LIV (CONTD)
I haven’t found a home since the
day I left mine And of all the
programs all the positions I
applied to this was the only one
that took a chance on me And I
never get chances

Her pointed nails dig into the skin

LIV (CONTD)
I never fit in growing up Never
The things I went through It would
make your blood run cold Nothing
has ever come to me easy My own
brother used to lock --
A123

Green Rev 89

GAIL
Your brother

Gail shrugs free

LIV
What

GAIL
You told me you were an only child

Liv stares into her lap breathing heavily When she
eventually looks back at Gail her eyes shine with tears

LIV
I say I’m an orphan too sometimes
They’re not my family anymore
That’s why this matters to me
Gail I don’t have anything else

INT MASTERS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER A123

Gail lifts Liv’s mug from the table frowning at the ring it

has left behind She leaves the room returning with cleaning
supplies Gail wipes down the coffee table arms moving with

muscular vigor

A faded footprint on the buffed oak floor catches Gail’s eye
Getting down on her knees she scrubs it from the ground

Under the watchful gaze of ANCASTER MEN framed in pictures
around the room Gail cleans with increasing fervor

The faint ring of a bell stops her dead in her tracks

INT MASTERS HOUSE - MAIDS ROOM - NIGHT 127
The lights are on Wind swirls through an open window the
bells chiming in response Papers fly from an open storage
box spiraling around the room like a tornado

She crosses to the window and pushes it shut The bells
quiet

Gail gathers the aged forms one catching her eye It is a
1797 bill of sale for a black woman Sinking to the ground in
disbelief Gail reads and rereads

The lights flicker out dropping the room into complete
darkness

A sound adds itself to Gail’s breathing hushed crying

The weak light of a gas lamp illuminates a woman - ELISHEBA -
in a corner of the room She scrubs the floor back turned

Gail jerks back in surprise Elisheba slowly turns to face
Gail Tears course her lined and tired face She gapes at
Gail with incomprehension

Gail scrambles backwards looking wildly around the room
Light blooms from gas lamps scattered around the room The
space is transformed as if from another time Clothes hang
from a line A tattered blanket covers a cot

A gust blows through the room and the bells begin to ring

Elisheba crawls towards Gail in surprise while Gail inches
backwards in fear The lights dim sporadically with the wind

As Elisheba approaches Gail can make out a gruesome scar on
her face

Gail is backed against the wall Tears stream from her eyes

GAIL
No no no no no

As the bells roar Elisheba reaches out extending her hand
towards Gail

The lights cut out

Gail huddles in the corner eyes squeezed shut hands
covering her ears

Green Rev 91
It’s a long while before she opens her eyes again The lights
are on She lowers her hands from her ears

The phone is ringing

INT MASTERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 128

Gail stands in the kitchen doorway warily observing the
ringing phone She stares mesmerized by its insistent ring

At last she strides ahead and picks it up

EXT DINER - NIGHT 129
A fluorescent diner shines like a mirage in the middle of

nowhere Gail emerges from her car a hollow haggard version
of the woman she once was

INT DINER - NIGHT 130

The place is mostly empty A TRUCKER guzzles coffee a
SALESMAN orders breakfast and an OLDER COUPLE share the
paper

A black woman LORNA heads directly for Gail

GAIL
Esther hi I --

Lorna raises an eyebrow Gail takes in her waitress uniform
the name “Lorna” stitched into her blouse

LORNA
Booth or counter

GAIL
booth

Lorna leads Gail to a corner booth Gail turns feeling
herself being watched
Yellow Rev 92

She turns to look out the diner window and finds herself
looking directly at a WOMAN IN BLACK slightly hunched her
pale face offset by her gloomy clothing

131 LATER 131

The woman ESTHER BICKERT white 60s looks plucked from the
canvas of American Gothic

They face each other in the booth neither very comfortable
with the other

GAIL
You’re Esther Bickert

ESTHER
I knew I would have to meet you for
this to make sense

Esther speaks English with the formality of a second
language

ESTHER (CONTD)
Here

Esther pulls a photograph from her cloak A young girl ina
bonnet and long dress smiles uncertainly into the camera

It takes Gail several moments to recognize her as Liv

GAIL
Is that Liv

ESTHER
Elizabeth

Gail looks back at the photograph aghast

ESTHER (CONTD)
It’s as if she walked off the edge
of the earth Left and never came
back In our community that’s not
unusual it’s unheard of We don’t
leave not like that Our world is
our own Of course there was no way
to find her

Gail struggles to follow along

ESTHER (CONTD)
And then one day there she was
Right there in a newspaper our
Elizabeth

(MORE)
Yellow Rev 93

ESTHER (CONTD)
But they were calling her Liv And
they were saying that she’s black

It’s unclear who is more baffled

GAIL
Liv is not black

ESTHER
Of course not She’s my daughter

GAIL
But her father

ESTHER
No god rest his soul No

This is getting a bit too weird for Gail

GAIL
This is a lot Why would you
How did you even find me

ESTHER
I saw you You were outside her
house one night I could tell that
she trusts you A friend I

thought

GAIL
I don’t -- this is between you and
Liv

Esther makes a strange noise that Gail realizes is a sob

ESTHER
She won’t speak to me The devil is
inside her She turned me away from
her own home Me her mother

GAIL
So what do you want from me

Esther pulls a leather bible from her bag

ESTHER
She loved this I remember the day
I gave it to her She sat right
down and signed her name So proud

Esther runs a wistful finger over the inscription page
ELIZABETH BICKERT is inscribed in ornate calligraphy that
weve seen before
Yellow Rev 94

ESTHER (CONTD)
She always had such beautiful
handwriting

She pushes the bible towards Gail

ESTHER (CONTD)
Will you bring this to her And let
her know that we love her her as
she is and not whoever she thinks
she has to be

132 EXT DIANDRA’S HOUSE - NIGHT 132

Gail hesitates before pushing the bell finger hovering
midair After a prolonged pause Diandra throws the door
open the sound of voices spilling into the night

DIANDRA
Gail you made it Thank goodness
This party needed a little more
flavor

133 INT DIANDRAS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 133
The party has reached a rapturous pitch

Faculty and Masters gulp down wine lips stained blood red
They hack at crimson soppresata dangling quivering chunks of
meat over open mouths They shriek with laughter

Liv is in her element by the stereo talking animatedly to
Master Foote

LIV
Gail get over here Help me DJ

Gail braces herself before heading over

MASTER FOOTE
I can’t believe it This is a
hostile takeover

LIV
Brian I love you but your music’s
not cutting it It’s time for us to
turn up

GAIL MASTER FOOTE
Liv do you have a minute For us to what

LIV
Get turnt Lit Gail can you
please educate this man for me

GAIL
I need to talk to you

Liv scrolls through a phone engrossed
LIV
In a sec Let me just show these

white folks what music is

A booming hip-hop track comes over the speakers The
Academics look over in amusement as Liv begins to sway

MASTER FOOTE
Well I’m out Two left feet You
can dance to this Gail

LIV
Of course she can

Liv reaches for Gail who pulls away

GAIL
Stop it

Laughing Liv grabs Gail by the hand pulling her close as
she dances

GAIL (CONTD)
Stop

Gail pushes Liv who staggers back a few steps The Academics
watch in stunned silence

Gail turns off the stereo

GAIL (CONTD)
You liar

LIV
What the fuck Gail

GAIL
I met your mom tonight Yeah

Liv blanches quietly processing the information

MASTER FOOTE
Okay let’s --

Gail turns to face the room
GAIL
Her mother is a white woman A full
on white woman

DIANDRA
So was Obama’s

JULIANNE
Biracial erasure is a big issue in
that community

GAIL
She’s not biracial She’s not

DIANDRA
So what are you saying

GAIL
What I’m saying is you’ve been
getting tutorials on blackness from
a white woman

Liv looks nervously at the Academics then back at Gail

LIV
Gail how could you

GAIL
How could you You fraud

The Academics look at each other uneasily

MASTER FOOTE
This is a huge accusation

LIV
It’s insane I don’t need to prove
my blackness to any of you

JULIANNE
You definitely do not And I’m not
comfortable honestly with the
direction of this conversation

GAIL
Oh fuck you What are you
comfortable with

JULIANNE
Wow that’s --

GAIL
Yeah wow Exactly Wow You people
are so --

Yellow Rev 97

LIV
You people

GAIL
-- divorced from reality that you
literally can’t tell black from
white That’s what this place does

MASTER FOOTE
Hang on --

GAIL
I know what happened to Jasmine If
she did all that to herself I
know I get it This place oozes
hate It might not be white hoods
and minstrels but it’s there It’s
like a ghost You can’t catch it
you can’t prove it And sometimes
you just want to have proof

DIANDRA
Gail calm down

The Academics watch in discomfort as Gail continues to spin
out

GAIL
She died And I could’ve helped
her I could’ve set her free But I
kept her here because that’s all I
knew That’s what I did that’s how
I got here But look at me

Gail spreads her arms wide then drops them

GAIL (CONTD)
I was never master I’m the maid
They brought me here to clean up I
didn’t change anything I didn’t do
anything I failed her So now she
haunts me And she will haunt me
forever

The sob that bursts from her throat surprises Gail and she
can’t stop the rest from following The room watches
awkwardly

Liv sighs watching Gail with weary empathy

LIV
Gail Oh Gail Come on
Cherry Rev 98

Drained Gail allows herself to relax into Liv’s embrace and
be led out the room

134 INT DIANDRAS HOUSE - BILLIARDS ROOM - NIGHT 134
Liv leads Gail into the room

LIV
Breathe

Gail warily obeys Liv hands her a glass of water

LIV (CONTD)
Gail what happened

GAIL
I had to talk to you

LIV
So you had to do it at a party You
had to lose your shit and drag my
personal life through the mud with
all those white folks looking on

GAIL
You’re white too

LIV
No I’m not Ill tell you who I am
even though you don’t deserve to
know the first thing about my
struggle

Liv fights back tears

LIV (CONTD)
You ever stop to wonder why I cut
her off Why this woman needs to
stalk a stranger to tell all her
private business to You ever
consider the source

GAIL
Liv --

LIV

That woman abused me That woman
raised me believing that I would go
to hell for being the bastard child
of a black man That’s the woman
you sat down with That’s the woman
youre trying to bring back into my
life How dare you
Cherry Rev 99

GAIL
She said your father’s white

LIV
Is that her story now Well did she
tell you about the beatings The
scripture memorizations Did she
tell you how I got this scar --

Liv holds out her arm which is crisscrossed with scars

LIV (CONTD)
-- or this one or this one

Chest heaving Liv catches her breath Cowed Gail brings a
tentative hand to Liv’s shoulder

GAIL
Liv Oh my god I’m so sorry I’ve
been so crazy stressed lately And
then she calls me and I see her
and she’s telling me about you and
she gives me this bible to give
you and I just -- I was just
trying to make it make sense

Liv snatches her black hoodie and coat from a nearby chair
and pulls them on

LIV
It doesn’t have to make sense to
you You didn’t live it it’s not
your story

She flips up her hood turning back at the door

LIV (CONTD)
Consider yourself lucky

Liv disappears into the party Diandra comes in just as Gail
is getting her coat

DIANDRA
Gail don’t go

GAIL
Oh god Diandra I --

DIANDRA
You don’t have to explain anything
I can’t imagine what you’ve gone
through this semester But please
don’t go Ancaster needs you We
need you We need your voice

INT DIANDRAS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 135

Gail sits on the sofa motionless mute Diandra and Julianne
carry on a conversation over her head

Master Foote takes a seat across from Gail smearing a
cracker with brie He bares wine-stained teeth

MASTER FOOTE
I don’t know if I’ve ever seen
anything like that

Gail looks past him an UNFAMILIAR PROFESSOR holding her
attention There is something off-putting in his half smile
and dark suit

Gail looks from the Unfamiliar Professor to an 18th century
portrait of an identical man

Nearby hangs a tintype photograph of THREE OLD MEN bent over
a desk Across the room the same Three Old Men appear to
huddle over a table One turns suspiciously towards Gail

GAIL
It’s always been this way

A photograph rests on the side table beside Master Foote It
shows him stern faced and unsmiling in a 19th century photo
outside an Ancaster building

GAIL (CONTD)
And it’s never going to change

Gathering her things she walks out the room

EXT QUAD - NIGHT 136

Gail crosses the quad face determined She pauses halted by
the unsettling sensation of being watched

She turns finding herself looking square at a SECURITY
GUARD He clips his walkie talkie

SECURITY GUARD
Faculty Mind if I take a look at
your ID
Yellow Rev 101

GAIL

SECURITY GUARD
‘Preciate it I’ll just give ita
quick scan and then --
GAIL
No I mean I don’t work here I was
just on my way out
The Security Guard pauses his demeanor icing over

SECURITY GUARD
Oh Well the exit’s that way

GAIL
Thanks

Jaw set she turns and walks away A small group of
OVERACHIEVERS tumble from the library One recognizes Gail

OVERACHIEVER
Master Bishop

Gail gives no sign that she even heard

OVERACHIEVER (CONTD)
Master Bishop

She doesn’t turn around

As Gail walks away slowly shrinking in the distance a
GROUNDS WORKER comes into view salting the path

Two DINING WORKERS hurry by pulling on their coats They
briefly stop to talk with the Grounds Worker

A group of DRUNK STUDENTS cross the quad
A JANITOR empties the trash
