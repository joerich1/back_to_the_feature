WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 1

BLACK

FADE UP SHACKLED FEET CHAINS drag along the ground PIRATES
led to their final reward -- the gallows FOOTSTEPS climb the
wooden steps An air of expectancy TILT UP to REVEAL --

EXT FORT - DAY

A PIRATE CABIN BOY stands on the gallows A noose is fitted
around his neck Among the PIRATES in line a TUNE begins
hummed low

Then the Cabin Boy begins to sing low and wavering focused
only on the song and not those who have come see him hang --

CABIN BOY (0S)
Yo ho haul together hoist the
colours high heave ho thieves
and beggars never shall we die

The Cabin Boy closes his eyes --
INTHE BLACKNESS a SILVER COIN FALLS tumbling slowly It is a

SILVER PIECE OF EIGHT irregular golden light glinting off its
rough surface --

CABIN BOY
The king and his men stole the queen
from her bed and bound her in her
bones

BACK TO SCENE as a PIRATE waiting joins in sings low

PIRATE
The seas be ours and by the powers
where we will -- well roam

In the crowd stands SIR CUTLER BECKETT among OFFICERS of the
EAST INDIA TRADING COMPANY He frowns at the waiting
prisoners as more pick up the song

PRISONERS
Yo ho haul together hoist the
colours high heave ho thieves
and beggars never say we die

Beckett gives a nod A wood-SQUEAK THUNK as the gallows
trap-door opens --

IN DARKNESS the SILVER PIECE OF EIGHT tumbles and turns

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 2

AT THE GALLOWS the line of Pirates watch with dread and

fascination as the young man dances his final dance Another Pirate

is led to the noose --

OLD MAN (0S)
Some men have died and some are alive

And others sail on the sea -- with
the keys to the cage and the
devil to pay we lay to Fiddlers
Green

AT THE GALLOWS another SQUEAK THUNK and CRY as the hapless
Pirate falls to his doom --

ALL PIRATES
Yo ho haul together hoist the
colours high -- HEAVE HO THIEVES
AND BEGGARS NEVER SHALL WE DIE

A lever pulled Another pirate SWINGS A rope tightens
Another pirate HANGS Faster and faster Beckett smiles A
DOZEN PIRATES now dangle at the END of their ROPES -- and a
FINAL PIRATE drops down boots CLOSE IN FRAME --

The SILVER PIECE OF EIGHT lands on a table spins and wobbles to
a stop TEAGUE Pirate Lord of Madagascar stares out a window
the weight of ill news in his eyes

Behind him on a table lies the Silver Piece of Eight next
to a candle an open envelope and letter

Teagues hand picks up the coin clutches it -- and the candle
GOES OUT --

CUT TO BLACK
A PAUSE then a WOMANS VOICE out of the DARKNESS
ELIZABETH (0S)
The bell has been raised from its
watery grave do you hear its

sepulchral tone

A small boat emerges out of the gloom Elizabeth moves it
with a long pole through a maze of pylons We are --

EXT SINGAPORE - HARBOR - NIGHT

Junks crammed together around ramshackle docks Criss-crossing
shadows from hanging lamps

UNDER THE DOCKS Elizabeth moves past raised platforms sees
an OLD LADY crouches gutting fish an ARTISAN blows glass

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 3

over a coal FIRE a LAUGHING BOY outside a FIREWORKS SHED
lights a pinwheel it spins sparks flying --

The SHADOW of a MONKEY races past Elizabeths apprehension
grows Its all weird surreal She keeps singing --

ELIZABETH (0S)
A call to all pay heed the squall --

EXT SINGAPORE - DOCKS - NIGHT
On the dock Elizabeth ties the bow line

ELIZABETH
-- and turn your sails toward home
Yo ho haul together --

EAST INDIA COMPANY MEN including MERCER approach She re-
ties the line as they pass Then resumes the song

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Raise the colors high Heave ho --

HUANG (0S)
-- thieves and beggars never say we
die

THREE GUARDS appear out of the darkness of a huge sewer pipe
Their leader is TAI HUANG

HUANG (CONTD)
A dangerous song to be singing for
any who are ignorant of its meaning
Particularly a woman Particularly a
woman alone

BARBOSSA (0S)
What makes you think shes alone

The Guards turn BARBOSSA stands behind them smiling

HUANG
You protect her
ELIZABETH
What makes you think I need

protection
Huang shouldnt have turned away her knife is at his throat

BARBOSSA
Your master is expecting us
(to Elizabeth)
And an unexpected death would cast a
slight pall on our meeting

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 4

Elizabeth lowers the knife

HUANG
Youre Captain Barbossa

BARBOSSA
Aye And she be Elizabeth Swann And
Sao Feng has promised us safe passage

HUANG
For as long as it suits him

Huang turns to lead them away -- stops holds up a hand

East India Company AGENTS go past Huang gestures ‘follow
me and leads them toward the huge sewer pipe --

EXT SINGAPORE - BRIDGE - NIGHT

The East India Company Agents keep a look out DROP DOWN to
the water below --

IN THE WATER a dozen or so COCONUTS float lazily with the
current And then one rises up -- the TOP of PINTELs head
Others rise out of the water -- coconut shells worn like
helmets by GIBBS RAGETTI COTTON and MARTY

They carry oilskin bundles take out large rasps wait poised
to file through the bars of a metal grate --

ON THE AGENTS as they hear wheels SQUEAKING turn to see

TIA DALMA pushing a cart carrying bird cages with twittering
canaries potions bottles and bags of flour Cottons PARROT
perches atop JACK THE MONKEY turns the crank of an ORGAN --

BENEATH THE DOCK -- Gibbs and his crew begin filing through the
grate the noise covered by the music --

EXT SINGAPORE - BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

As Huang leads Barbossa and Elizabeth toward the door of a
low-slung decrepit bath house The two confer in whispers

ELIZABETH
Have we heard anything from Will

BARBOSSA
The whelp is more than capable of
taking care of himself But you in
the presence of Sao Feng youll be
wanting to show a bit more diffidence
than is your custom

ELIZABETH
Hes that terrifying is he

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 5

BARBOSSA
Hes much like myself absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair
play

Huang raps out a signal on the door A slit opens eyes scan
him the slit closes the door opens --

EXT SINGAPORE - UNDER THE DOCKS - NIGHT

Pintel and Ragetti keep filing -- until suddenly the music
STOPS Ragetti files one stroke too many oops --

ON THE DOCKS one of the Agents regards the Monkey holding it up
with the tip of his sword The other pokes at the cart

AGENT
(to Tia Dalma)
You cant be here

Tia Dalma lifts her face -- they see she is BLIND
TIA DALMA
Your mother always knew it be you
who threw the linens down the well
But she forgave you for it

AGENT
How did you know that

TIA DALMA
The canaries

She grins a black-teeth smile The Agents jump back Jack
the Monkey goes back to grinding the music picks up --

BELOW Pintel and Ragetti return to sawing --
INT BATH HOUSE VESTIBULE - NIGHT
Huang stops bars Barbossa and Elizabeths way

HUANG
No weapons Remove them please

BARBOSSA
Of course

Barbossa and Elizabeth lose their swords pistols Huang
holds up a hand to stop Elizabeth He gestures to her coat

HUANG
Did you you think because she is a
woman we would not suspect her of
treachery

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 6

BARBOSSA
When you put it that way

HUANG
Remove please

Elizabeth strips off her coat Huang takes it and reveals
two swords in hidden scabbards in the lining Again they
start past -- Huang stops Elizabeth AGAIN Smiles

HUANG (CONTD)
Remove Please

Elizabeth looks indignant --
INT BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

ON ELIZABETH self-conscious in a short robe and nothing
else She and Barbossa follow a DRAGON TATTOOED half-naked
pirate into the bath house They move past algae-covered
tubs and leaky rusted pipes Elizabeth notes all of the
men have the same DRAGON TATTOO

SAO FENG steps out of a tub two attendants -- LIAN and PARK
(in corset-like outfits) -- dress him in full pirate garb

Sao Feng does not acknowledge Barbossa and Elizabeths
presence Barbossa gets it he must speak first

BARBOSSA
Captain Sao Feng Thank you for
granting me this audience

SAO FENG
Captain Barbossa Welcome to
Singapore
(to a guard)
More steam

The Guard bangs on the wall twice --
INT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

Two short ATTENDANTS work the boiler and bellow system that
feeds steam to the bathhouse above Gibbs crawls out of a

tunnel followed by Pintel Ragetti Cotton and then
Marty who did not have to crawl They see the attendants
smile at each other -- no problem --

A HUGE ATTENDANT comes into view Problem Ragetti moves to
crawl back into the tunnel Gibbs grabs his collar --

GIBBS
(sotto)
None of that
(MORE )

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 7

GIBBS (CONTD)
If things dont go the way we want
then were the only chance we have
it wont go as bad as we expect

520 INT BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

STEAM issues from the pipes Sao Feng leans over a vent
waving it into his face

SAO FENG
I understand that you have a request
to make of me

BARBOSSA
And a proposal to make to you Ive
a venture underway and I find myself
in need of a ship and a crew

SAO FENG
And you consider me worthy of such
an honor A ship and crew
(a chuckle)
Huh Thats an odd coincidence

ELIZABETH
Because you happen to have a ship
and a crew you dont need

Barbossa gives her a warning glance

SAO FENG
No Because earlier this day not
far from here a thief broke into my
most revered uncles temple and
tried to make off with these

Sao Feng crosses to a wizened OLD MAN who clutches ANCIENT
CHARTS to his chest Sao Feng tries to take them -- but the
Old Man really does not want to let them go

A look from Sao Feng and the man releases them

SAO FENG (CONTD)

Navigational charts The route to
the Farthest Gate

(Barbossas smile

falters slightly)
Wouldnt it be amazing if this venture
of yours took you to the world beyond
this one

BARBOSSA
It would strain credulity at that
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 8

Sao Feng gazes at him levelly He nods to two GUARDS near
one of the baths The Guards haul a FIGURE out of the tank --

Its WILLIAM TURNER He gasps for breath Sao Feng grabs him
by the hair displays his face to Elizabeth and Barbossa

SAO FENG
This is the thief Is his face
familiar to you

Both play it cool neither have ever seen him before Sao
Feng studies them shrugs -- and picks up a huge FID --

SAO FENG (CONTD)
No Then I guess he has no further
need for it

He prepares to stab Will with the fid -- Elizabeth tenses --
Sao Feng spots the tell His pleasant demeanor is gone

SAO FENG (CONTD)
You come into my city you seek my
indulgence and largesse and you
betray my hospitality You betray

me

BARBOSSA
Sao Feng I assure you I had no
idea --

SAO FENG

-- that he would get caught
Sao Feng stares Barbossa shrugs yeah okay

SAO FENG (CONTD)
You intend to attempt a voyage to
Davy Jones Locker And I cannot
help but wonder why

Barbossa tosses something to Sao Feng who catches it -- a
silver PIECE OF EIGHT Sao Feng examines it

SAO FENG (CONTD)
A piece of eight
(looks up at Barbossa)
Its true then

BARBOSSA
Aye The time is upon us We must
convene the Brethren Court

He BANGS twice on the wall No steam

SAO FENG
More steam

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 9

INT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

Marty sits atop the huge Attendant tightening a knot Cotton
puzzles out the boiler mechanism Gibbs Pintel and Ragetti
move out of the room further under the bathhouse --

INT BATH HOUSE - NIGHT
Sao Feng leans over a vent breathes in the soothing steam

SAO FENG
The Court has not met in my lifetime

BARBOSSA
Nor mine

Sao Feng toys with a Captains knot pendant at his neck

SAO FENG
And when last it did my father told
me it ended badly

BARBOSSA
But the time before that it produced
the Code which has served us well
and it was the very first meeting
what gave us no less than rule of
the sea herself didnt it And now
that rule is being challenged

SAO FENG
The East India Trading Company
BARBOSSA
(nods )
Lord Cutler Beckett is a pox on us

all
INT BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

Oilskin bundles are unrolled swords pistols and grenades
The pirates place the grenades in the floor joists

Ragettis attention is drawn to a knothole He peeks through
Gets a better angle with his wooden eye It catches Pintels
attention Ragetti point up mouths Elizabeth

INT BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

SAO FENG
There is a price on all our heads
it is true It seems the only way a
pirate can turn a profit anymore
(he regards Will)
is by betraying other pirates
(MORE )

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

SAO FENG (CONTD)

(back to Barbossa)
But pirates are either Captain or
crew and nine squabbling captains
trying to chart a course is eight
captains too many Against the
company what value is the Brethren
Court What can any of us do

ELIZABETH
You can fight

She realizes she said that out loud All eyes on her

INT BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

Pintel shoves Ragetti aside peers through the knothole --
INT BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

Elizabeth steps forward

ELIZABETH
You are Sao Feng the Pirate Lord of
Singapore You command in the Age of
Piracy where bold Captains sail
free waters where waves are not
measured in feet but increments of
fear and those who pass the test
become legend

A huge dragon TATTOO GUY steps forward to put a hand on
Elizabeths shoulder She shrugs him off continues

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Would you have that era come to an
end on your watch

INT BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

Pintel flinches at the sight gives Ragetti a dismayed look
what are you smoking dude

INT BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

ELIZABETH
But here you are your ships crowd
the harbor rotting on their lines
while you cower in your bath water

Sao Feng regards her makes a circle around her

SAO FENG
Elizabeth Swann There is more to
you than meets the eye isnt there
And the eye does not go wanting

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07
He smiles charmingly at her -- she cant help but smile back

SAO FENG (CONTD)
(to Barbossa)
But I cant help but notice you have
failed to answer my question What
is it you seek in Davy Jones Locker

WILL
Jack Sparrow

Sao Feng freezes The room goes dead still too

WILL (CONTD)
Hes one of the pirate lords

Park one of the twins giggles at the name -- stops smiling
when Sao Feng glares at her LIAN hides her own smile Sao
Feng works to hide his rage

SAO FENG
The only reason I would want Jack
Sparrow returned from the realm of
the dead is so I can send him back
myself

BARBOSSA
Exactly why we preferred his name go
unmentioned

UNDER THIS Sao Feng spots The DRAGON TATTOO of one of his
Guards is MELTING -- STENG

SAO FENG
So you admit you have deceived me

BARBOSSA
Jack Sparrow holds one of the Nine
Pieces of Eight He failed pass it
along to a successor before he died
And so we must go and fetch him back --
Sao Feng catches Huangs eye directs him toward Steng

SAO FENG
WEAPONS

Sao Fengs men (and women) produce weapons from beneath the
water in the tubs --

529 INT CRAWL SPACE - BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE

Gibbs and the others exchange a glance -- its gone bad --

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 12

INT BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

Barbossa and Elizabeth are suddenly at the center of a ring
of weapons pointed at them

BARBOSSA
I assure you our intentions are
strictly honorable --

He has his hands spread wide -- and then suddenly SWORDS
are pushed up through the floor boards and Barbossa finds
himself holding a sword in each hand Crap Elizabeth has

two swords she tosses one across the room to Will

Sao Feng holds the point of the fid to Stengs face
SAO FENG
Drop your weapons or I kill your

man

Barbossa frowns Confused looks from Barbossa to Will to
Elizbeth Back to Sao Feng Barbossa shrugs

BARBOSSA
Kill him Hes not our man

WILL
If hes not with you and not us
who is he with

The question is answered as suddenly EAST INDIA TRADING
COMPANY AGENTS storm in -- CRASHING through windows --

Instantly the Pirates turn back-to-back to face this new
threat Sao Feng spins away from Steng to fight

Will grabs another sword from below and wades into the battle --
INT CRAWL SPACE - BENEATH THE BATH HOUSE

Pintel and Ragetti light a fuse to a grenade attached to
one of the joists -- EXPLOSION --

INT BATH HOUSE - NIGHT

THE BATH HOUSE IS ROCKED and half the floorboards drop down
making a ramp Gibbs Marty Cotton Pintel and Ragetti rush
in firing pistols join the fighting --

As MERCER strides in with a phalanx of SOLDIERS Lian attacks
him with a sword he fires at her killing her point blank --

Park pulls a steel chopstick out of her hair sets out for
vengeance Pirates flee and scatter --

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 13
533 EXT SINGAPORE - DOCKS - VARIOUS - NIGHT 533

Our heroes flee down ramps up ladders swing on ropes East
India Trading Company AGENTS fire pistols engage with swords --

Amid the fighting a stack of crates is knocked over Pintel
pushes Steng out of the way saving him

Steng grins his thanks -- then suddenly slashes at Pintel
who jumps back

PINTEL
Hey Youre a pirate

Steng slashes Pintel falls backwards over a rail --

Elizabeth and Barbossa Cotton and Marty take on an array of
East India Trading Company AGENTS --

534 Agents crouch behind the push-cart of Tia Dalma The canaries fly 534
away from it through open doors of their cages The Agents realize
something is wrong and run --

Just as the cart EXPLODES --

535 ON A PLATFORM a wall collapses and Mercer is knocked back into 535
the shadows He pulls a steel chopstick out of one shoulder
then the other Looks up and sees --

Will comes around a bamboo scrim -- where Sao Feng grabs
him He puts a knife to Wills throat Fighting gunfire
explosions can be seen past them through the scrim

SAO FENG
Odd coincidence isnt it The East
India Trading Company finds me the
day you show up in Singapore

WILL
It is coincidence only

Will twists away flashes his own knife Sao Feng blocks it
Mercer unseen grins and draws his pistol aims --

WILL (CONTD)
You want to cut a deal with Beckett
You need what I offer

ON MERCER ready to fire -- but hesitates

SAO FENG
You crossed Barbossa youre willing
to cross Jack Sparrow -- why should

I expect any better

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 14

WILL
They are in the way of what I want
Youre helping me get it

Sao Feng accepts this logic but has a final point

SAO FENG
You betray me and I will slit your
throat

WILL

Then we have an understanding
They each lower their knives Sao Feng hands Will the charts

ON THE DOCKS Jack the Monkey lights a rocket The rocket shoots
across the water into the fireworks shed EXPLOSIONS and the
shed TILTS OVER SPLASHES --

ON THE PLATFORMS Barbossa and Elizabeth arrive see Will holding
the charts standing with Tai Huang

BARBOSSA
You have the charts

WILL
And better
(indicates Huang)
A ship and a crew

ELIZABETH
Wheres Sao Feng

WILL
He will cover our escape -- then
meet us at Shipwreck Cove

HUANG
This way Be quick

Barbossa nods he and Will follow Tai Huang away followed
by Elizabeth Pintel Ragetti Cotton ON MERCER still hidden
he recedes back into the shadows

EXT HAI PENG - DECK - NIGHT

The Chinese Junk sails out of the harbor The night sky GLOWS
from FIRES burning in Singapore Barbossa confronts Will

BARBOSSA
You werent supposed to get caught

WILL
It worked out the way I wanted

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 15

He moves away -- past Elizabeth who looks out from the rail --
there are dozens of ships clustered on shore Beyond them
the glow of Singapore as it burns

ELIZABETH
Theres no place left for him to
cower Do you think he will honor
the call

Tia Dalma steps up behind her
TIA DALMA

I cannot say There be something on

the seas that even the most staunch

and bloodthirsty pirates have come

to fear --
EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY
The Dutchman SURFACES CANNON PORTS open CANNONS FIRE --
rapid no time for reloading -- PIRATES SHIPS are hit
BROADSIDES Their cannons return fire

The Dutchmans cannons go silent Smoke drifts from the
barrels becoming

EXT CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY - LATER

» smoke that the Flying Dutchman sails through regally
smoke issuing from burning wreckage It sails past revealing

IN THE DISTANCE the Endeavour rides majestic on the horizon --
INT ENDEAVOUR - CAPTAINS CABIN - DAY

A MAP of the world ship models representing squadrons
Several officers pore over it

A PIECE OF EIGHT spins on a desktop a hand slams down on
it Becketts He picks it up examines it The Dead Mans
Chest is on the desk as well

BECKETT
A piece of eight Nine of them you
said

MERCER

Our new friend in Singapore was very
specific sir nine pieces of eight

BECKETT
What is the significance of that I
wonder

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

MERCER
Does it matter Theres nothing can
hold against the armada
(taps fingers on chest)
not with the Flying Dutchman at the
lead

BECKETT
Nothing we know of Did our friend
happen to mention where the Brethren
Court is meeting

MERCER
He was mum on that sir

BECKETT
Then he understand the value of
information Speaking of best

keep all this to ourselves

He glances across the room where SWANN sits at a table
signing orders one after another

BECKETT (CONTD)
We cant have anyone running off to
Singapore can we Ah Admiral

Now-Admiral NORRINGTON has entered the cabin

NORRINGTON
You summoned me Lord Beckett

BECKETT
Yes Something there that better
suits your new station

He nods to a long wooden box on a sideboard Norrington thinks
he recognizes it opens it Inside is his SWORD A glance

back at Beckett who nods Norrington lifts the sword
considering what it means

UNDER THIS

BECKETT (CONTD)
The Brethren know they face
extinction All thats left is for
them to decide where they will make
their final stand

ON SWANN - a clerk sets a sheaf of documents before him

SWANN
Not more requisition orders

CLERK
No sir Execution

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 17

Swann is distressed by that briefly he makes eye contact
with Norrington Both men quickly look away Swann picks up
his quill resumes his distasteful task

GROVES enters salutes Beckett

GROVES
The attack is ended sir

EXT ENDEAVOUR - DAY

Governor Swann stares out at sections of blasted hull
floating barrels and bodies Beckett and Norrington arrive
gaze out at the carnage

NORRINGTON
Appalling

Beckett raises his spyglass

BECKETT
Bloody hell Theres nothing left
(to Norrington)
Prepare to lower the boat Fetch the
chest

Swann wants to turn away but forces himself to look --
INT FLYING DUTCHMAN - CAPTAINS CABIN - DAY

Music plays Jones gazes at the locket with the picture of
hanging from the pipe organ He lifts it gently

A tear forms in his eye Jones touches a knuckle to the tear --
and is stunned by its presence by his own emotions He knows
the cause glances toward the deck --

EXT FLYING DUTCHMAN - DECK - DAY

The Dead Mans Chest is brought over the rail guarded by
MARINES including MURTOGG and MULLROY and led by Norrington

Norrington takes in the ship the crewmen not happy to be
there He notes the fear in his men

NORRINGTON
Steady men We stand aboard a
seagoing vessel no more and no less
You will comport yourself as marines

Murtogg puts a hand on a rail snatches it back disgusted

MULLROY
Oh now its not all that bad A
little bit of elbow grease is all
she needs

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 18

MURTOGG
We set the grease on fire

MULLROY
And get away as fast as we can

MURTOGG
Its a two-part plan

MULLROY
Thats how you know its a good one

Jones strides up but keeps his distance from the chest

JONES
Go the lot of you -- and take that
with you I will not have that
infernal thing on my ship

BECKETT
Oh Im sorry to hear that Because
I will Because it seems to be the
only way to ensure this ship do as
directed by the Company

Jones grips the ships rail with his claw Beckett nods
indicates Norrington should continue away with the chest

JONES
The Dutchman sails as its Captain
commands

BECKETT

And the Captain is to sail it as
commanded This is no longer your
world Jones The immaterial has
become immaterial I would have
thought youd learned that when I
ordered you to kill your pet

Swann steps forward

SWANN
Did you give those ships opportunity
to surrender

JONES
We let them see us Methinks that
opportunity enough

SWANN
My daughter could have been aboard
one of them That alone is cause to
exercise restraint

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

BECKETT
We need prisoners to interrogate
Which works best when they are alive

JONES

I am exterminating pirates As
commanded by the Company

(to Swann)
And your daughter is dead Pulled
under with the Black Pearl -- by my
pet Did Lord Beckett not tell you
that

Swann is taken aback with shock -- then whirls and runs for
the cabin Beckett gives Jones a dark look follows --

INT FLYING DUTCHMAN - CABIN - DAY

The chest is set in place The key inserted into the lock by
Norrington He opens the chest the BEATING HEART is inside

Swann comes into the cabin purposeful The MARINES
immediately point their rifles at the heart Swann grabs one
of their bayonets intending to plunge it into the heart --
Norrington grabs his wrist

NORRINGTON
Governor

SWANN
Did you know Did you

He doesnt know what hes talking about

SWANN (CONTD)
Shes dead Elizabeth is dead

Norrington is stunned Swann breaks down Norrington jerks
his head to the marines leave They do

Swann regains his purpose --

SWANN (CONTD)
Let me go Let me do this

JONES (0S)
Let him go

Jones is in the doorway

SWANN
Stay back I will kill you

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

JONES
And are you prepared for what comes
after When I carved that traitorous
vessel from my body I cast upon it
a terrible geis If you stab my heart
then yours will take its place

The import of that is not lost on Swann and Norrington

JONES (CONTD)
The crew is not bound to me they
are bound to the Dutchman and
the Dutchman must have a captain
Will ye serve

Swann hesitates -- Beckett and Mercer arrived in time to
hear the end of Jones speech Beckett is none too pleased

BECKETT
Governor Your daughter is still
alive

MERCER

Saw her myself in Singapore

Thats news to Jones he snaps an angry look at Beckett
Beckett waves him off

SWANN
Youre all liars

BECKETT
No Jones is merely cruel But perhaps
I am guilty of sin by omission For
which I apologize

NORRINGTON
Governor Weatherby theres
still hope
Swann searches his face -- he at least is sincere

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
I have hope

The anger drains from Swanns face He releases the bayonet
to Norrington To Beckett

SWANN
Our association is ended

Norrington escorts him out past Beckett -- he gives Beckett
a narrow look he does not like what he just heard

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

BECKETT
Youre dismissed Captain

Jones gives him the same narrow look exits Beckett
contemplates his options as he shuts the chest softly

MERCER
Hes a sly one that Jones Whos
going to kill him if they become
him

Beckett considers that not good

BECKETT
I can order Admiral Norringtons
silence Hell obey its what he
does

MERCER
And the governor

Beckett considers he is genuinely regretful
BECKETT
Yes Well Every man should have a
secret he carries to his grave

546 EXT HAI PENG - DECK - DUSK

Will makes a line fast -- notices a speck of water on the
back of his hand Looks up --

Many SNOWFLAKES are falling down onto the ship
547 EXT BETWEEN WORLDS - ICE PASSAGE - DUSK

The Hai Peng sails into a frozen glacial landscape
548 EXT HAI PENG - DECK - DUSK

The monkey shivering Ragetti shivering Pintel shivering
Tia Dalma stands nearby not shivering

PINTEL
No one said anything about cold
RAGETTI
Im sure theres good reason for us
suffering
PINTEL

Why didnt the obeah woman just bring
back Jack the way she brought back
Barbossa

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 22

TIA DALMA
Because Barbossa was only dead

He didnt know she was standing there

TIA DALMA (CONTD)
Jack Sparrow be taken body and soul
to a place not of death but
punishment The worst fate a person
can conjure for himself stretching
on forever Thats what awaits in
Davy Jones Locker

She moves away

RAGETTI
I knew there was a good reason

549 CLOSE ON THE MAP as Will moves the circles within circles of
the chart In the center a drawing of a ship rotates

WILL
(to Huang)
Nothing here is set It cant be as
accurate as modern charts

HUANG
No But it leads to more places

Will stares after Huang as he moves away Wills focus moves
to one of the inscribed poems He frowns

WILL
Over the edge back over again
sunrise sets flash of green Do
you care to interpret Barbossa

BARBOSSA
Ever gazed upon the green flash
Mister Gibbs

GIBBS

I reckon Ive seen my share

(to Will)
Happens on rare occasion at the
last glimpse of sunset a green flash
shoots up into the sky Some go their
whole lives and never see it Some
claim to have seen it who aint
Some say --

PINTEL
-- it signals when a soul comes back
to this world from the dead
(Gibbs glares at him)

Pintel slinks away joins Ragetti

RAGETTI
Dont they get it Its a riddle
Riddles are fun Over the edge
back over again --

PINTEL
Riddles are not fun The way it always
goes is some poor bloke ends up dead
but just beforehand he realizes no
I wasnt supposed to listen to the
sirens I wasnt supposed to take
the pot gold but by then its too
late and he dies in a horrible and
ofttimes ironical manner and in
this case you and I be the poor
bloke

By the time Pintel is done with his rant all on deck are
staring at him Barbossa grins

BARBOSSA
See Mister Turner We will find a
way Its not getting to the land of
the dead is the problem -- its
getting back

EXT HAI PENG - DECK - NIGHT

Elizabeth stands beneath a lantern at the rail She stares
out at the dark sea The icebergs are gone Will joins her

The ocean before them is a mirror stars above and below

A silence between Will and Elizabeth Finally

WILL
How long do we continue not talking

In fact Elizabeth doesnt want to talk But --
ELIZABETH
Once we rescue Jack everything will

be fine

There are many ways to intrepret those words and Will runs
through them all Finally concludes

WILL
Then we will rescue Jack
Elizabeth nods steps back from the rail -- turns and leaves
Will leans forward arms on the rail and notices

Far away a line of white mist stretches to infinity

Barbossa Ahead

BARBOSSA
Aye these be the waters I know
Were good and lost now

ELIZABETH
Lost

BARBOSSA
For certain you have to be lost to
find a place as cant be found
Elseways everyone would know where
it was aye

Barbossa laughs Gibbs looks over the rail --

GIBBS

The ship gathers more speed and the SOUND of RAGING WATER
is heard

WILL (CONTD)

and keep her trim

Pirates scramble to comply -- Barbossa strides forward
BARBOSSA
Belay that Let her run straight and
true

Will climbs the rigging looks out --

WILL
Hard a-port

FROM ABOVE we see the Hai Peng as it fights the pull of the
current turning -- but not sharp enough

PULL BACK AND REVEAL an endlessly long WATERFALL where the
ocean itself flows over and down into nothingness

Tia Dalma appears on deck Unlike those around her she is
calm and serene She tosses her crab claws down onto a barrel
head Leans over them murmurs an INCANTATION

She repeats the phrase faster and then slower Moves the
claws around in an intricate repeating pattern --

The ROAR is now DEAFENING Will wrestles the wheel Elizabeth
whirls to Barbossa as he pulls himself to his feet

ELIZABETH
Youve doomed us all

BARBOSSA
Dont be so unkind Ye may not
survive to pass this way again --
and these be the last friendly words
yell hear

FROM ABOVE the Hai Peng continues to turn fighting to escape
near sideways now to the edge

The hull of the Hai Peng sticks out into the air and
then the entire ship TILTS over and TOPPLES DOWN --

Elizabeth SCREAMS Barbossa LAUGHS all the Pirates CRY OUT
as the ship plummets down into --

BLACKNESS

And SILENCE Then SINGING and LAUGHTER Various pirate voices
distant eerie Yo ho yo ho a pirates life for me

And just as quickly as they came the voices FADE
FADE UP

then stops and looks down There is a problem
JACK (CAPTAIN) (CONTD)
Mister Sparrow come here

JACK (BOATSWAIN) (CONTD)
Aye Captain
Jack drops down from the rigging Captain Jacks demeanor is
rigid with a gaze that could wither Captain Bly
JACK (CAPTAIN) (CONTD)

What say ye about the condition of
the knot on this bow line

JACK (BOATSWAIN) (CONTD)
It be proper to my eyes sir

As he speaks Captain Jack tugs on the line and it unravels

JACK (CAPTAIN) (CONTD)

Proper It is neither proper nor
suitable sir It is not acceptable
nor adequate It is in obvious fact

an abomination

Another Jack steps forward -- earnest well-meaning

JACK (HONEST) (CONTD)
Begging your pardon sir Perhaps if
you gave the man another chance --

JACK (CAPTAIN) (CONTD)
Its that sort of thinking that got
us into this mess

Jack pulls a pistol and SHOOTS honest Jack who goes stumbling

backwards over the rail Jack turns back --

CLOSE ON Jacks face close enough to see the spittle fly

JACK (CONTD)
You have caused us to lose speed and
therefore time Precious time which
cannot be recovered once lost Do
you understand Aye Captain DO YOU

NOW

PULL BACK to see that there is no one speaking to Jack and
he speaks to no one He carries both sides of the argument

Madness in his eyes

JACK (CONTD)
It will have to be redone All of
it All of it And let this serve as
a lesson to the lot of you

PULL BACK MORE We see the true state of the Black Pearl
Sails flat No crew No movement No other Jack Sparrows
The Black Pearl sits alone in a vast desert With Jack
Sparrow alone raving on the deck

JACK (CONTD)

Its the doldrums sir it has the
entire crew on edge -- Stow it I
have no sympathy for any of you
feculent maggots --

(steps up onto rail)
-- and no more patience to pretend
otherwise

He steps off the rail -- on the wrong side
EXT DAVY JONES LOCKER - BLACK PEARL - DAY

Jack drops down into the sand next to the Black Pearl Picks
up a rope and pulls -- his feet dig into the sand he goes
nowhere The rope angles up behind him to the ship Hes
trying to pull it to no avail He slumps down

JACK
No wind

Nearby are several SMOOTH ROUND STONES Jack picks one up
and FLINGS it skipping it across the sand Jack sits down
Looks over Weirdly the stone comes rolling back

The stone rocks back and forth an egg hatching Cracks
appear The stone transform into a crab

The Crab turns toward Jack Clicks like its laughing

JACK (CONTD)
Perfect What would my torment be
without unusual crabs here to mock
me

Jack grabs a handful of sand and flings it The crab flinches
back Jack collapses

The crab scuttles forward looks at Jack Scuttles sideways
looks at the ship The crab moves away to the pile of stones

Jack sits with his head lowered to his knees alone in the
dunes of the vast desert

RAGETTI

Jack steps up to the rail and ceremoniously pulls out a
telescope the way a Captain would do it

But I did bear it Didnt I I just

ON THE STERN DECK Ragetti surreptitiously readies a fishing
pole Moves to the railing looks down Drops the line --

IN THE WATER a pale BODY hurries past face up eyes closed
hands crossed over its chest Ragetti lets out a cry jumps
back He edges back to the rail --

A STREAM of BODIES flows past underwater Old young men

and women at different depths and moving at different speeds

Pintel has joined Ragetti watching over the side

PINTEL
Eerie Downright macabre

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 36

(musing)
I wonder what would happen if you

dropped a cannonball on one of ‘em
They look at each other -- lets find out

Pintel picks up a cannonball turns -- Tia Dalma is there
fixes them both with stern look Frightened Pintel drops
the cannon ball

PINTEL
Be disrespectful it would

TIA DALMA

(looks out to sea)
They should be in the care of Davy
Jones That was the duty he was
charged with by the goddess Calypso
to ferry those who died at sea to
the other side And every ten years
he could come ashore to be with she
who loved him truly But he has become
a monster

RAGETTI
He wasnt always all tentacle-y

TIA DALMA
No he was a man once Poor
unfortunate souls now they must
find their own way

Ragetti nods spots something ahead a small boat coming
toward them lit by a lanterns glow

RAGETTI
Now its boats coming

EXT BLACK PEARL - FORWARD DECK - NIGHT

He looks to Tia Dalma for confirmation
TIA DALMA

We are but ghosts to them They heed
us not

past an eerie surreal sight Elizabeth looks at the nearest
boat peers closer Recognizes the passenger

Jack puts a consoling hand on Elizabeths shoulder

JACK

He looks her in the eye Elizabeth stares at him -- and
realization dawns Her next cry is one of anguish

ELIZABETH

half his face leaving the rest in shadow

SWANN

Are you dead

ELIZABETH
No

Swann nods at that Elizabeth has to move along the rail of
the Pearl toward the stern to keep pace with him

SWANN
I think I am

ELIZABETH
No You cant be

SWANN
(has trouble recalling)
There was a chest you see How
odd At the time it seemed so
important

ELIZABETH
Come abroad
(to the others) )
Someone -- cast a line
(to Swann)
Come back with us

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 38

Crewmen prepare a line too slowly for Elizabeth She grabs
it from them casts it out It lands neatly in Swanns boat
but he makes no move toward it

SWANN
And a heart and if you stabbed the
heart you would have to sail

forever Thats how it worked Stab
the heart and take his place The
Dutchman must have a Captain Silly
thing to die for

Will makes note of that Jack makes note as well Glances at
Tia Dalma But Tia Dalma is focused only on Will She
whispers just loud enough for Will to hear --

TIA DALMA
A touch of destiny

Due to the action of the two vessels passing the rope begins
to slip toward the edge of the boat

ELIZABETH
Take the line

SWANN
(suddenly this is
important)
Elizabeth

She gives him her full attention

SWANN (CONTD)
When I would reprimand you to obey
rules it was because I did not want
you to ever be unhappy But I should
have recognized in your willfulness
» your courage I am proud of you

Jack to haul her back

Ill give your love to your mother
then shall I
Elizabeth stares after him Watching helpless

Elizabeth turns toward Will into his arms He confronts her
but his eyes drift toward Tia Dalma

» then opens it further until it is much longer It droops
at the end Barbossa looks at him He smiles Barbossa snaps
his telescope closed

EXT BLACK SAND BEACH - DAY

Pintel and Ragetti crawl out of the surf as the other boats
land Jack and Barbossa step onto the sand spot something
The rest of the pirates see it too

PINTEL
Criminey

Jack and Barbossa walk toward it Pintel and Ragetti hustle
past them toward --

The KRAKEN It lies dead on the shore Pintel finds a
driftwood stick pokes it

RAGETTI
Careful

PINTEL
Ahh not so tough now are you Stupid
fish Serves you right

Jack approaches the Kraken almost reverently

RAGETTI
Hello I bet folk would pay a shilling
to see this And a second shilling
for a sketch of ‘em sitting atop

PINTEL
Kraken slayers We could carve
miniture Krakens out of coconut and
sell those too We could give ema
slice as a souvenir

RAGETTI
Or fried For lunch

PINTEL
I wonder which of the parts is edible

Jack stares into the huge eye of the beast his image
reflected back Barbossa appears behind him

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

BARBOSSA
Still thinking of running Jack
Think you can outrun the world The
problem of being the last of anything
by and by there be none left at
all

JACK
Sometimes things come back Were
living proof mate

BARBOSSA
Aye but thats a gamble with long
odds aint it Theres no guarantee
of coming back But passing on --
thats dead certain

Jack contemplates that one Barbossa regards the beast

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
The world used to be a bigger place

JACK
Its still the same size Theres
just less in it
(reluctant)
Summoning the Brethren Court is it

BARBOSSA
Our only hope
JACK
Thats sad commentary in and of

itself
INT BLACK SAND BEACH - WELL —- DAY
Marty stoops to drink -- jumps back with a shout A BODY
lies dead in the water face down Barbossa samples a handful

of water spits it out

BARBOSSA
Poisoned Fouled by the body

The body is turned over -- Steng the betrayer in Singapore
The wooden fid has been driven through his eye

PINTEL

EXT BLACK SAND BEACH - DAY

They rush outside Ragetti yells something but words are
lost He points --

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

OUT PAST THE REEF floats the Black Pearl -- and next to it
a Chinese fighting ship the EMPRESS

Jack and Barbossa stare There is a loud CLICK Their eyes
go sideways to find -- Tai Huang holds a pistol on them
backed by his men

JACK

Hes the Captain

EXT BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - LATER

The landing party climbs on deck CHINESE PIRATES -- too
many to fight -- have taken over the Pearl Theyve stripped
the crew of their weapons shackled them together

Elizabeth is held by TWO GUARDS One of them rubs a swelling
eye the other has a bloody lip

Jack and Barbossa spot Sao Feng at the same time Jack
recognizes him and tries to be inconspicuous behind Barbossa

BARBOSSA
Sao Feng You showing up here ‘tis
truly a remarkable coincidence

SAO FENG
Fortune smiles upon those prepared
to meet its gaze
(moves toward Jack)
Jack Sparrow You paid me great
insult once

He SLUGS Jack in the jaw Jack staggers his knees buckle --
but he keeps his feet Holds up a hand to Sao Feng to wait
searches for his hat Finds sets it back on his head

JACK
So now we can call it square
SAO FENG
Hardly
Will strides up -- he spots Elizabeth in chains --
WILL
Shes not part of the bargain Release
her
BARBOSSA

And what bargain be that

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 50

SAO FENG
(to his men)
You heard Captain Turner Release
her

JACK
Captain Turner

GIBBS
Aye the perfidious rotter led a
mutiny against us

JACK
Its always the quiet ones

Elizabeth unchained now eyes Will warily

ELIZABETH
Why didnt you tell me you were
planning this

WILL
It was my burden to bear

BARBOSSA
The only way a pirate can make a
profit these days is by betraying
other pirates

SAO FENG
I can live with that as long as
I am not the other pirates

JACK
But youve no acrimony toward
mutineers

SAO FENG
He did not mutiny against me did
he

WILL
I need the Pearl Thats the only
reason I came on this voyage

JACK

He needs the Pearl --

(to Elizabeth)
-- and you felt guilty --

(to Barbossa)
-- and you and your Brethren Court
Didnt anyone come to save me
just because they missed me

Gibbs Marty and Cotton raise their hands -- Pintel and
Ragetti see and follow their lead

Im standing over there with them

Sao Feng grabs his arm

SAO FENG
Im sorry Jack but theres an old
friend who wants to see you first

JACK
Im not certain I can survive any
more visits from old friends

SAO FENG
Here is our chance to find out

He nods his head toward a spot over Jacks shoulder --

Rounding the island is the ENDEAVOUR Jack is yanked roughly
away by Sao Fengs men

INT ENDEAVOUR - CAPTAINS CABIN - DAY

Jack has been escorted into the room Beckett signals his
guards to leave without turning He stands at the window
peering out at the Black Pearl Jacks effects are on the
table -- including the Compass So is a decanter and two
glasses of Sherry Jack searches the room surreptitiously
under the following

BECKETT
Remarkable The last I saw of that
ship she was on fire a blackened
hulk sinking beneath the waves

JACK
Thank you for that memory

BECKETT
We had a deal I contracted you to
deliver cargo on my behalf You chose
to liberate it

Jack glances toward his right wrist

JACK
People arent cargo mate

BECKETT
And you incurred a heavy debt to
raise her back up didnt you Its
not here Jack

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 52
He turns Jack assumes an air of questioning innocence

JACK
What is not

BECKETT
The heart of Davy Jones Is safely
aboard the Flying Dutchman and so
unavailable for use as leverage to
satisfy your debt to the good captain

Jack clocks that

JACK
By my reckoning that accounts been
settled

BECKETT
By your death And yet here you
are

JACK
Close your eyes and pretend its all
a bad dream Thats how I get by

Becketts control lapses momentarily he says something hes
wanted to say for a long time

BECKETT
Your good deed cost me much Jack

JACK
And you spared me any possibility of
ending up as anything other than
what I am And for that I thank
you

He picks up a couple of the model ships from the table
pretends to sail them

JACK (CONTD)
Will someone be in soon to draw you
a bath

Beckett takes them from Jack puts them back in their places

BECKETT
It would be nice if all of us could
be on holiday year ‘round but someone
must ensure that the world turns
properly
(looking over his
world )
People are what they love Jack and
what they love is cargo
(MORE )
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 53

BECKETT (CONTD)
They love spices and linens silks
» plantains and as long as it
arrives on time and in sufficient
supply they are content to be nothing
more than figures in a ledger Youre
a smart man you know Im right

JACK
If youre offering me a seat on the
board I am neither depraved enough
nor drunk enough to accept

Beckett hands one of the GLASSES of sherry to Jack whos a
bit surprised Beckett toasts him

BECKETT
Then perhaps youll consider a
different arrangement One that
requires nothing from you but
information

Jack has spotted the Pieces of Eight on Becketts desk

JACK
Regarding the Brethren Court no
doubt In exchange for fair
compensation Square my debt with
Jones guarantee my freedom

BECKETT
Of course Its just good business

JACK
Were I in a divulgatory mood what
might I divulge

BECKETT
Everything Where are they meeting
Who are the Pirate Lords What is
the purpose of the nine pieces of
eight

JACK
I think Id prefer to maintain my
monopoly on those answers Its just
good business

BECKETT
You havent changed Enjoy the
gallows

JACK

Ive been Once youve taken in the
view theres not much else to it

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 54

JACK (CONTD)
Now far be it for me to give advice
to you but if I were me and you
were you and we each had the same
lack of trust in the other imagine
you are me You would propose that
rather than you telling me where the
Brethren Court is meeting you lead
me there instead whereupon you could
serve up to me the Pirate Lords the
Nine Pieces of Eight and the whole
of the Brethren Court on a silver
platter And you being me I would
likely accept such an offer

BECKETT
On a silver platter

JACK
With a frilly linen napkin and a
spicy banana on the side

shackle his arms

Will is hauled away Sao Feng turns to Mercer

Lord Beckett wouldnt give up the

Sao Feng looks around The sailors outnumber his men and
all are armed watching for trouble Sao Feng nods sharply
to his man at the wheel -- he steps aside for the sailor

Mercer gives Sao Feng a half-salute and ambles away Barbossa
sidles up next to Sao Feng

BARBOSSA
Shame theyre not bound to honor the
Code of the Brethren Isnt it Of
course honors a hard thing to come
by nowadays

SAO FENG
There is no honor to remaining with
the losing side Leaving it for the
winning side thats just good
business

BARBOSSA
The losing side says you

SAO FENG
They have the Dutchman And what do
the Brethren have

He sees Sao Feng is considering his words He leans close

BARBOSSA
We have Calypso
Soa Feng is surprised unbidden his eyes cut toward Elizabeth --
Barbossa clocks it -- then Sao Feng adopts a skeptical mein
SAO FENG
Calypso An old legend
BARBOSSA
No the goddess herself bound in
human form fury or favor you
not be knowing but when the mood
strikes her and its her favor she
bestows upon a lucky sailor well

youve heard legendary

Barbossa and Sao Feng exchange knowing smirks

There was a time when the seas be
untamed the world a rougher place
and a sailor made his own fate

I need the Brethren Court

Barbossa taps the knot pendant Sao Feng wears

SAO FENG

Sao Feng nods -- it seems a reasonable price to him

BARBOSSA
No No Out of the question

SAO FENG
It was not a question

Elizabeth has been thinking it through

He reaches out to take her arm but she yanks it out of his
grasp holds up a warning finger ah-ah

SAO FENG (CONTD)

your favor

Elizabeth is a bit surprised by his respect but shes willing

to take it

Jack extends his hand Beckett smiles at it

BECKETT
Jack I just recalled I have this
wonderful Compass that points to
whatever I want So for what do I
need you

JACK
Points to the thing you want most
And thats not the Brethren Court

BECKETT
No Then what is Jack

JACK

Dead

He gestures to the compass try it Beckett opens the compass
From his reaction it points to Jack Jack scuttles sideways
From Becketts reaction the needle follows him

BECKETT
Damn

He flings the compass to Jack Then realizes

BECKETT (CONTD)
Although it occurs if I got what I
wanted most then wouldnt what I
wanted second most become the thing
I wanted most If I killed you I

can find Shipwreck Cove was it
On my own Cut out the middleman as
it were literally

JACK

With me killed then youll arrive

at the Cove find its a stronghold
nigh impregnable able to withstand
blockade for years and youll be
wishing oh if only there was someone
who you had not killed inside to
ensure that the pirates come outside

insult me Who am I

Beckett turns looks -- Jack wraps a rope around the cannon
wheel a burning fuse lighter in hand

BECKETT
Youre mad

JACK
Oh thank goodness Because if I am
in fact not living some wretched
fever dream I doubt this will work

Jack lights the cannon -- Beckett dives out of the way as it
FIRES -- the ball hits the mast behind him cracking it The

Like rats on a line crew members crawl across to the Empress

NORRINGTON
One at a time Quickly now
(to Elizabeth)
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren
I fear there is a traitor among them

ELIZABETH
It is too late to earn my forgiveness

NORRINGTON
I do not ask it I had nothing to do
with your fathers death But that
does not absolve me of my other sins

Elizabeth looks at him -- and finally believes him

ELIZABETH
Come with us

Norrington wants to come

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
James Come with me

Norrington really wants to Nearly all of the Chinese crew
members are across Elizabeth implores him Then there is a
sound from the deck -- a FIGURE shuffles toward them

BOOTSTRAP (0OS)
Who goes there

The moment is broken A lingering look -- and then Norrington
draws his sword turns Elizabeth stands beside him

NORRINGTON
GO I will follow

ELIZABETH
Youre lying

NORRINGTON
Our destinies have been entwined
Elizabeth But never joined

Norrington gives in -- and kisses her He breaks the kiss --

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
GO NOW

He shoves her away Turns The Figure grabs a pike for a
weapon Steps out of the dark It is Bootstrap Bill

NORRINGTON (CONTD)
Back to your station sailor

Elizabeth upside down crawls along the line Bootstrap
sees her Something isnt right Not quite sure what

BOOTSTRAP
No one leaves the ship

NORRINGTON
Stand down Thats an order

BOOTSTRAP
Part of the crew Part of the ship

Bootstrap stares like hes trying to figure it all out

NORRINGTON
Steady man

Something snaps in Bootstrap
BOOTSTRAP
All hands All hands Prisoner escape
all hands

Norrington races toward Bootstrap

NORRINGTON
Belay that

Bootstrap shuts up Too late The SOUND of running FOOTSTEPS
approach Crewmen appear --

Elizabeth hanging upside down is halfway across She sees
he is in trouble

ELIZABETH
James

She starts back toward him --
Norrington draws his pistol aims upwards FIRES --

-- hitting the tow line severing half the strands The other
strands quickly strain and SNAP --

Elizabeth swings down and away SPLASHES into the water as
the EMPRESS drifts free She hangs on pulls hand over hand --

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07
Norrington spins back --

AND IS RUN THROUGH stabbed by Bootstrap Bill Norrington
cries out in pain --

NEAR THE EMPRESS Elizabeth grabs a rope dangles near the
hull As the two ships part as she disappears into darkness
she looks back in time to see --

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
NO JAMES

-- Norrington collapse to the deck Bootstrap stands over
him doesnt understand what he has done Crewmen appear
crowd the deck staring

CLACKER
The Admirals dead The Admirals
dead

The phrase echoes through the Crewmen Davy Jones appears --

CLACKER (CONTD)
To the Captains Cabin Aye

Crewmen race away past Jones past Bootstrap knocking him
back Bootstrap still doesnt understand Jones leans down

JONES
James Norrington do you fear
death Do you fear judgment on the
other side

Norrington suddenly lurches upwards thrusting his sword
into Jones shoulder Jones frowns unaffected unhurt
Norrington stares then collapses dead

JONES (CONTD)

I take that as a -- ‘no

Jones pulls Norringtons sword out of his shoulder Regards
the blade with genuine appreciation

JONES (CONTD)
Nice sword

He slashes it through the air --

INT FLYING DUTCHMAN - CAPTAINS CABIN - NIGHT

Pirates crowd in and before them is a tableau The chest is
open Murtogg and Mullroy trembling and several other
SOLDIERS have their rifles pointed directly at the heart

And behind them stands -- Mercer Next to him is a small
cannon The Pirates pull up short They part as Davy Jones
enters Jones is scared

JONES
Close it CLOSE IT

Jones nods Mercer closes the chest locks it with a KEY on
a chain He tilts the cannon into place -- pointed squarely
at the chest

MERCER
Nothing has changed

Jones watches as Mercer puts the chain around his neck
EXT BLACK PEARL - DECK —- DAY
Jack and Gibbs on the aft deck Cotton at the wheel

GIBBS
Look alive and keep a careful eye
Not for nothing its called Shipwreck
Island where lies Shipwreck Cove
and Shipwreck City

JACK
You know for all that pirates are
clever clogs capable of the most
underhanded and duplicitous thinking
- we are an unimaginative lot when
it comes to naming things

GIBBS
Aye

ON THE FORWARD DECK Tia Dalma finds Barbossa

TIA DALMA
Barbossa why you not giving the
order to man the guns All the
Brethren be gathered in this place
You can force them do as you want

BARBOSSA
What I want is not to act the fool
and what youre suggesting is nought
but fools folly

Tia Dalma caresses Barbossas cheek seductively

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 76

TIA DALMA
If you no longer want my favor
Barbossa then perhaps I should be
calling a different captain to my
cause Witty Jack would not turn
down the promise to survive the coming
storm I think

BARBOSSA
I do not renege on a bargain once
struck but we agreed to ends only
the means are mine to decide

Tia Dalma catches his wrist She squeezes and his forearm
and hand become decayed skeletal -- dead

TIA DALMA
Caution Barbossa Do not forget it
was by my power you be returned from
the dead or what it means if you
fail me

She moves away but he catches her arm and pulls her close

BARBOSSA
And dont you forget why you had to
bring me back and why I could not
leave Jack to his well-deserved fate
and why I could not give Sao Feng a
second smile in his throat to match
that ineffably smug one he wears on
his face It took nine Pirate Lords
to bind you Calypso -- and it takes
no less than nine to set you free
Til then Ill not be taking commands
from you nor risk you reaching accord
with someone else Mr Pintel Mr
Ragetti Take this fishwife to
the brig

Pintel and Ragetti hurry to comply

PINTEL
Right this way Missus Fish

Theres some dangerous cross tides
ahead that will prove a trick to
navigate

If you knew how many died making it
deep enough -- youd believe
They sail toward a distant light The ship passes outside --
EXT SHIPWRECK COVE - SHIPWRECK CITY - DUSK 611
FROM ABOVE Shipwreck Island is hollow with a round water
cove In the center is Shipwreck City constructed of broken
derelict ships
Moored around the city -- PIRATE SHIPS of all types from
all over the world PULL BACK to find Pintel Ragetti and

Jack as they stare out

PINTEL
Look at them all

BARBOSSA
Theres not been a gathering like
this in our lifetime

JACK
And I owe all of them money

INT ENDEAVOUR - CAPTAINS CABIN - NIGHT 613

The door is opened by Groves who steps out of the way
(quickly) to let an angry Jones pass

JONES
I cannot be summoned like some mongrel
pup

BECKETT

Apparently you can I believe you
know each other
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 78

He gestures to Will who holds a teacup and saucer He nods
to Jones

JONES
Come to join my crew again Master
Turner

WILL

Not yours His
(suddenly ‘remembers )
Jack Sparrow sends his regards

Beckett is surprised by that -- just as Will intended
JONES
Sparrow
WILL

(to Beckett)
You didnt tell him Jack was rescued
from the locker Along with the Black
Pearl

(tsk tsk)

Jones absorbs this turns his ire on Beckett

JONES
What else have you kept from me

BECKETT
There is another issue
(pointed toward Will)
far more troubling
(to Jones)
You are familiar with a person called
Calypso

Jones tries for a measured response but is not quite
successful

JONES
Not a person A heathen god Who
delights in cursing men with their
wildest dreams and then revealing
them to be hollow and nought but
ash The world is well-rid of her

WILL
Not quite so well actually
(sips his tea)
The Brethren Court intends to release
her

JONES
No They cannot
(MORE )
WHITE REVISION 7-4-07

JONES (CONTD)
The first court promised to keep her
imprisoned forever That was our
agreement

BECKETT
Your agreement

JONES
I told them how to bind her She
could not be trusted She gave me no
choice
Will clocks that the words are familiar --
JONES (CONTD)
(to Beckett)
We must act before they release her

-- and Will realizes

WILL
You loved her

Jones snaps a look at him

WILL (CONTD)
Shes the one And then you betrayed

her

JONES
She pretended to love me She betrayed
me

WILL

And after which betrayal did you cut
out your heart I wonder

Jones hurls the table out of the way slaps away Wills tea
cup gets right in his face

JONES
Do not test me

WILL

(re his tea)
I wasnt finished with that

(down to business)
You will free my father

(stands to Beckett)
And you will guarantee Elizabeths
safety and my own

Will considers that briefly shrugs sure makes sense

WHITE REVISION

BECKETT
Your terms are steep Mr Turner We
will expect fair value in return

JONES
There is only one price I will accept
Calypso Murdered

WILL
Calypso is aboard the Black Pearl
Jack has sailed the Black Pearl to
Shipwreck Cove

BECKETT
-- with you no longer aboard it How
do you proposed to lead us there

Will holds up Jacks Compass

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 81

GIBBS
Aye the original plan called for
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso
but when the first Court met the
Brethren were to a one skint-broke

PINTEL
So change the name

GIBBS
What to nine pieces of whatever we
happened to have in our pockets at
the time Oh yes that sounds real
pirate-y

BARBOSSA
(holds out his hand)
Mr Ragetti if you will

RAGETTI
I kept it safe like you said when
you gave it to me

BARBOSSA
Aye you have but now I need it
back

Ragetti hesitates Barbossa holds his hand under Ragettis
eye gives him a slap on the back of his head -- the eye
falls into his hand Barbossa drops the eye into the bowl

MISTRESS CHING
Were missing two By the sound of
it

Jack reaches for the coin circlet on his headband considers
Barbossa takes note of the gesture -- Jack drops his hand

JACK

Im content to wait until Sao Feng
joins us

Elizabeth stands in the doorway with Huang behind her She
starts in Huang touches her shoulder gestures to the globe

Before he died he named me captain
of the Empress and passed his
lordship onto me

Listen Listen to me Our location
has been betrayed Jones under the
command of Lord Beckett -- they are
on their way here

JOCARD
Who is this betrayer

BARBOSSA
Not likely anyone among us

Elizabeth realizes --

ELIZABETH
(to Jack)
Wheres Will

JACK
(shrugs)
Not among us

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 83

BARBOSSA
And it matters not how they found
us The question is what will we do
now that they have

ELIZABETH
We fight

The other pirates laugh dismissive

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Good men have already given their
lives to this cause

AKSHAY
(playing to the other
pirates )
And so what matters the lives of a
few bad ones quips Sri Sumbhajee

More laughter

ELIZABETH
They died in defiance of the Company
Thats my measure of good

That silences them Jack regards Elizabeth calculating

MISTRESS CHING
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress a well-
supplied fortress There is no need
to fight if they cannot get to us

Others of the Court give that consideration

BARBOSSA
There be a third course
(gathers them by eye)
In another age -- at this very spot --
the first Brethren Court captured
the Sea Goddess and bound her in
her bones That was a mistake

BARBOSSA (CONTD)
We tamed the seas for ourselves
aye yet opened the door for Beckett
and his ilk Better were the days
when mastery of seas came not through
bargains struck with eldritch
creatures but by the sweat of a
mans brow and the strength of his
back alone And you all know this be
true

They do

free Calypso

Shoot him and then cut out his tongue
And then shoot his tongue And trim
that scraggly beard

HUANG
Sao Feng would have agreed with
Barbossa

ELIZABETH

Sao Fengs judgment in matters Calypso
shouldnt be trusted even if he
were here

The last is directed primarily to Huang Huang takes her
point steps back

VILLANUEVA
Nonetheless I would have agreed
with Sao Feng

JOCARD
Calypso was our enemy then she will
be our enemy now

CHEVALLE
And her moods not likely improved

Villanueva pulls out his pistol SLAMS it on the table

WHITE REVISION 7-4-07 85

I do not love you

His words sting her
TIA DALMA
Many things you were Davy Jones
but never cruel You have corrupted
your purpose and so yourself
She reaches a hand out through the bars toward his chest --
TIA DALMA (CONTD)
and you hid away what should

always have been mine

She touches his chest where his heart should be -- and he
is REVEALED now the MAN he once was

He reaches back through the bars to caress her face

TIA DALMA
I will be free And when I am I
would give you my heart and we

would be together always
He traces his hand down the contours of her face

TIA DALMA (CONTD)

She removes his hand from her chest and now the hand that
was at her throat is his CLAW

tings against the bars of the cell trapped inside

BARBOSSA
It was the first Court what imprisoned
Calypso We shall be the ones to set
her free And in her gratitude she
will see fit to grant us boons

JACK
Or at least grant em to the one of
us who summoned the rest of us and
connived all of us to set her free

Barbossa shoots him a glare The other pirates eye Barbossa
suspiciously

JACK (CONTD)
Its not impossible Is it so
improbable

BARBOSSA
If you have a better alternative
please share

Pen em up together and theyll
devour each other without a second
thought So yes we could hole up
here well-provisioned and well-armed
and half of us will be dead within
the month and half of the other
half dead the month after that

The pirate lords cant argue with that

JACK (CONTD)

Or we can release Calypso and we
can pray shell be in a merciful
mood But can we pretend that she
is anything other than a woman
scorned like which fury hell hath
no No we cannot Res ipso loquitur
tabula in naufragi we are left with
only one option I agree with --

(gets it out)
Captain Swann we must fight

Slander and calumny I have only
ever embraced that oldest noblest
of all pirate traditions My fellow

where the map has been cut out

circle revealing a new map On it A drawing of a fountain

Inscribed on the curve Ponce de Leon

That cant be right He looks around -- and finds a bottle

of rum tucked away behind the seat He picks it up checks
the compass again whatever he sees makes him smile --
