INT SPORTSMANS LODGE - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - DAY

A large crowd has gathered to watch two WHITE BOXERS square
off in a temporary ring in the center of a converted banquet
hall One is BOBBY the other is RICKY They are drawn
together to start the bout by a bell and a hand gesture as
the REFEREE backs away Immediately the two fighters unload
a relentless barrage of POWER PUNCHES Neither man is
holding back and the punches all find purchase in the
swelling faces of their opponent The crowd rises to its
feet in appreciation of this rare level of competition in
the lower strata of the heavyweight division

CUT TO
EXT BOBBYS CAR - COLDWATER CANYON - LOS ANGELES - SUNSET

Bobby drives Ricky home through the winding twists of LAs
landmark canyon Both their faces are swollen verging on
the grotesque Bobby drives a black Special Edition 1979
Trans Am with the gold Firebird stenciled across the hood
The car is not in great shape but in its day ruled the
road A Hawaiian mini warrior mask hangs from the rear view

The T-top is out and Ricky struggles to light his
cigarette in the wind He finally ignites the whole book of
matches in frustration lights up then tosses it out

It lands still flaming at the base of a No Smoking in
the Canyon sign They drive down the palm tree lined
stretch of road bordering Beverly Hills They turn East on
Sunset Boulevard The Strip lights are first flickering to
life

EXT RICKYS APARTMENT - YUCCA CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The opening SCORE dies away as Ricky sits beside Bobby The
neighborhood is awful The light of the corner liquor store
and a menthol cigarette billboard make up for the broken
street lamps Ricky smooths out his running suit and steals
an instinctive cautionary look scanning all the blind spots
for predators The swelling has now truly set in Hes a
mess

full of coke

WELSHMAN

He opens it with drunken abruptness sending part of its
contents onto Bobbys jacket

WELSHMAN (continues) (CONTD)

He starts rubbing the spillage from Bobbys lapel onto his
gums Horrace prevents any more waste by taking the envelope
away

WELSHMAN (continues) (CONTD)
Sorry mates Now there isnt even
enough to go around

HORRACE
Dont worry man Its all for you

WELSHMAN
(touched)
No really mate

Horrace positions himself so that the Welshman can sniff
from his hand The four large men all reposition themselves
in the tiny stall inevitably stepping on each other and
banging heads

RICKY

OUTSIDE THE STALL the attendant watches the feet shuffle
as they curse from within INSIDE Tom snorts a pile of
cocaine from Horraces outstretched hand

claws his way into the bathroom and rinses his face in a
meagre attempt to wash away the cobwebs He looks awful The
COLORS are beginning to INTENSIFY as sleep deprivation sets
in

The car crosses the Brooklyn Bridge and drives through
Brooklyn

INT LIMOSINE - BROOKLYN - SAME

Bobby is watching and thinking as Brooklyn goes by Horrace
seems distant
EXT ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - BROOKLYN - DAY

The limo passes the corner and settles in front of the time
worn Icarus Tavern

A young IRISH MAN stands out front smoking a fag The place
is open but the neon OPEN sign is off

INT LIMOSINE - IN FRONT OF THE ICARUS - CONTINUOUS
They pop the doors

HORRACE

The two guys get out and enter the pub Horrace carries the
case of cash The guy at the door watches them enter and
snuffs out his smoke

INT ICARUS TAVERN - RED HOOK - CONTINUOUS

They enter the old world gin mill Its dark Theres a
long aged wooden bar and oak booths The floor boards are
faded and bowed A middle-aged BARTENDER reads the Post by
the oversized beer taps He looks up over his reading
glasses without expression Two young Irish TOUGHS stand up
from a booth and lead the men into the back room There is a
silent tension No sign of Ricky

INT BACK ROOM - ICARUS TAVERN - CONTINUOUS

Even darker They slowly walk in sending cautious looks to
every corner A simple round table sits in the center of
this sparse dining room Three ROGUES sit around it all
facing the door Tom the Welshman sits with his back to
the door They all have pints before them A muted
conversation ends as Tom follows their stares over his
shoulder to see Bobby and Horrace enter Silence for a BEAT
then

WELSHMAN
Here they are then

HORRACE
(falsely relaxed)
Hows it going

WELSHMAN
Brilliantly Care for a pint

HORRACE
No thanks man We got to head out

WELSHMAN
Come now You just got here

HORRACE
Thats alright man Its a little
early for me to drink

This draws an uncomfortably bass chuckle from the seven
dark characters now surrounding them

WELSHMAN
Nonsense Well have three half
pints of lager

One Irishman goes to fetch the drinks Two of the Irishmen
pat them down for guns

WELSHMAN (continues) (CONTD)
Sorry about that Wheres your mate

HORRACE
Couldnt make it Heres the money

Horrace places the case on the table Its weight makes a
loud thunk as it hits the hardwood He pops the catch and
lifts the lid Wow Thats a lot of money The toughs lose
their poker faces as their knees weaken from the sight of
it Even Bobby has to swallow as the Devil blows on his
nape Tom fingers the stacks

HORRACE (continues) (CONTD)
(anxious)
Give me your marker and well be
on our way

Tom begins to write out a receipt

Then

WELSHMAN
I cant yet vouch for the amount
unless you want me to sit here and
count

HORRACE
No man thats fine Just put that
you took delivery

in what takes only a matter of seconds Bobby has a

LOCKBLADE to his THROAT and Horrace takes a truncheon to the
gut flooring him

Tom is

WHACK

HORRACE (continues) (CONTD)
What the fuck man Why The
moneys in your hand Why you

WELSHMAN

spics took the bag Understood Grab

He takes one in the gut violently losing his wind

HORRACE

(to Bobby)
If you and your boy set this up
youre way out of your league
ROGUE

Shut up

VOICE (OS) (0S)
Maybe youre the one who better
shut up

They all turn to see RICKY standing tall with a PISTOL to
the head of a tough with two beers Ricky sips the third
lager

ROGUE
Hes only got six shots hes bound
to miss

RICKY
Or maybe Im real lucky Ill tell
you one thing Ill waste every
bullet making sure youre dead if
you dont take that knife away from
my friends throat

The thug removes the blade from Bobbys neck His eyes
narrow as he looks at the gun He notices something

THUG
Thats a starter pistol

RICKY
(covering)
What

THUG
His guns a starter pistol I can
see the red plug in the barrel

The toughs begin to relax and converge

RICKY

(nervous)
Are you willing to risk your life
over-

But the moment proves enough of a distraction for Bobby to
unload a damaging COMBINATION to his captor He may not have
what it takes to cut it as a professional boxer but these
untrained goons are way outclassed He drops one like a lead
weight Its about to get ugly as weapons are raised
Then The melee is cut short by a resounding VOICE calling
from the door

JIMMY
Thats enough

Jimmy the driver stands in the door aiming a Glock 45 at
the crowd

They all freeze

JIMMY (continues) (CONTD)
You guys over in the corner Leave
the hardware and your wallets on the
table

(to bartender)
Make out an invoice on damages You

him a card)
E-mail it to me A check will

bottom and tell them the Rook is

split

Horrace nods

INT MAXS OFFICE - VAN NUYS - DAY

Bobby and Ricky sit before Max They look the worst weve
ever seen them Theyve obviously not slept or changed yet
and flew right out after the melee

Maxie looks at the open case of cash

A long tense BEAT of unclear reaction Is Maxie mad or
happy Finally

MAX
You did good

He throws them each a bundle off the top of the pile of
bills Ten grand stacks

MAX (continues) (CONTD)
I never intended to test you two to
that extent but you both came

Bobby trots up the stairs Ricky lights a smoke and watches
him go We linger on his look

INT JESSICAS HOUSE - BLACKBURN - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The door opens The living room looks like a disaster area
The sink is full of dishes stacked high above the counter
Dirty clothes are strewn all over Half eaten plates of food
are on the coffee table and bags of carry-out containers and
pizza boxes lie about In the center of it all Chloe sits
alone watching a Hollywood Hills brushfire on the news She
looks up with the solemnity of one much older

BOBBY
Wheres mommy Did she leave you
alone again

Chloe looks to the back room as she sips from her juice
box Bobby sees a MIRROR and COKE laid out on the table He
grits his teeth and goes for the bedroom door

INT BEDROOM - JESSICAS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Bobby bursts in to find Jess in bed with the HORNY BACHELOR
whose nose he broke the week before The guy jumps in fear

Jess is startled and coked out of her mind

HORNY GUY

JESS

Before he can finish his stammering is cut short by her
bolting across the room and into his arms

She squeezes him with all her might
We see Bobbys relief and happiness over her shoulder

FADE TO
EXT BOBBYS CAR - SMALL DESERT HIGHWAY - OUTSIDE LOS
ANGELES - NEXT MORNING

We FADE UP on a beautiful sunny morning travelling on an
empty desert road The only car visible is Bobbys Trans Am
in the deep background leaving the mountains behind The
CAMERA TRACKS BACKWARDS along the road as the car closes
slowly We hear Chloes angelic voice as she sings a melody
As the car draws closer we see Bobby still in the clothes
from the trip driving There is luggage packed for a
journey Bobby looks content When the car finally settles
into a TWO-SHOT through the windshield we notice SMOKE
coming from the back seat A moment later Ricky sits up
behind them He is half awake and cranky

RICKY

Princess

She ignores him

RICKY (continues) (CONTD)
