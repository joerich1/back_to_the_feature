INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
HANDHELD VIDEO CAMERA POV UNDER A BRIGHT LIGHT

Were in a crime scene The camera POV reveals police
officers moving around a small house

Glimpses A couple of partial footprints in blood
circled in white chalk A trampled bloodstained pizza
box spilling cold pizza

RAINS (0S)
Hey Steiner

The shot swings up quickly to reveal LIEUTENANT JOE
RAINS early 50s heavy set and gritty looking

RAINS (CONTD)
Get a shot o’ this

He points toward the fireplace cold with gray ash The
camera leans for a closer look at a broken gold chain
then picks up something else A pendant a couple of
inches away A dolphin

OFFICER AIMES (VO)
Lt Detective Martin is here

The camera swishes up again finding Rains turning to
look at DETECTIVE BEN MARTIN early-40’s just outside
the front door shaking off a wet coat Rain falls behind
him Martin is good looking under a few day’s worth of
five o’clock shadow

RAINS (V0O)
You look like shit You just wake up

MARTIN
Gotta sleep to wake up

RAINS
You get a night off I figure maybe
youd sleep

MARTIN
Youd figure

RAINS
I guess that means no call from Gina
yet

MARTIN
No
RAINS
How long’s it been since you heard
from her

Martin glares at the cameraman OFFICER STEINER

MARTIN
Would ya get that thing out of my
face

STEINER (0S)
Sorry Detective I--

RAINS
(to the cameraman)
It’s all right
(to Martin)
Captain’s orders He wants everything
recorded No 0J in the footprints

Martin gives in with a half sneer Looks around the room

MARTIN
They here For sure

RAINS
(grimly )
One The boy In the bedroom

MARTIN
(a painful sigh)
The girl

Rains shakes his head indicating he doesn’t know

RAINS
Maybe she got away

MARTIN
Maybe

Martin’s face looks less than optimistic

MARTIN (CONT’D)
I came here on the canvas Recognized
it when I drove up

RAINS
I know

MARTIN
I wrote down the guy’s name What the
fuck was it Dressed like a golfer
He takes out his note pad starts to flip through it but
Rains has the answer first

RAINS
Edward Applegate The address popped
your file at the station No record
No prints Not even a driver’s
license Gave you a fake name

MARTIN

Fuck FUCK I was here Joe
RAINS

We’re not having beers Ben
MARTIN

Sorry Lieutenant I was here
RAINS

I know
MARTIN

Those kids were here They were
fucking right here They were
probably alive

RAINS
Don’t go there You don’t know--
MARTIN
Don’t do that
RAINS
What
MARTIN

Don’t pacify me I was here

RAINS
You were at a hundred houses You
don’t know who was alive in this
house who was dead You wanna sit on
a pity pot do it out in the rain
Otherwise let it go ‘cause it ain’t
helping

Beat Martin takes that in nods

RAINS (CONTD)
All right then Tell me about this

Rains produces a business card Martin recognizes it
MARTIN
I gave it to him on the canvas Maybe
he dropped it

RAINS
I don’t think so

Rains flips the card over Something is written on the back
Martin takes it for a closer look

MARTIN
(reading)
“He knows how I feel” What the fuck
is this

RAINS
You tell me

MARTIN
I have no idea what this means

RAINS
You ever talk to him again after the
day you were here

MARTIN
No

RAINS
You sure

MARTIN

I’m sure I came on the canvas I
wrote down his name I left I wish
Id blown his brains out but I left
Haven’t been back till now and I have
no idea what this is about

He means the business card Rains takes it back

RAINS
Come on There’s something else

Martin follows him into the BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS) The
camera trails from behind Rains nods toward a closet

RAINS (CONT’D)
You want a look at the kid

Martin looks that way shakes his head

MARTIN
Later
He follows Rains out of the bedroom into a hallway

Steiner stays behind and pushes into the closet with the
camera POV The bright light splashes on the face of a
dead young man about 20 worn pale suggestive of much
suffering before death One wrist and one ankle are
chained to a concrete wall

INT HALLWAY SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

The bright light of the handheld camera bounces down a
short hallway toward another bedroom

MARTIN (VO)
What’s all this

Entering the room the shot reveals a desk set up with a
computer and monitor

RAINS
Computer’s clean except for one file
A video

MARTIN

You watch it

RAINS
Not yet

MARTIN
Why

Rains nods toward officer ANNA LORENTO late 20’s who
presses a button on the keyboard A PASSWORD box comes
up The text above it says “Who is missing”

MARTIN (CONTD)
“Who is missing”

RAINS
What do you think

MARTIN
Maybe Ellen Ellen Fowler

RAINS
Tried it I also tried “Gina”

Martin’s eyes snap over to him flaring
RAINS (CONTD)

He called you here Ben Asked for
you by name
He flips the business card between his fingers

RAINS (CONT’D)
I gave it a shot Didn’t work

Silence hangs

RAINS (CONTD)
So what do you think he means

MARTIN
I don’t know

RAINS
The guy’s clearly got a thing for
you Come on Ben Who is missing

MARTIN
I don’t know
RAINS
What’d you talk about when you were
here
MARTIN
Nothing the Fowler kids and kids
RAINS
Kids What kids
MARTIN
He asked about Gina and told me

about
A memory comes to Martin’s face Realization

MARTIN (CONT’D)
Aaron

RAINS
Who’s Aaron

MARTIN
His kid Aaron’s who he’s missing

Rains nods to Lorento who types “Aaron” into the password

box It’s accepted

RAINS
Guess you talked about more’n you
recall
The monitor begins to show a roughly edited home-movie
dark images shot within this very house glimpses of
walking legs turning shoulders bodies in shadow

Cheep horror music high pitched riffs

An amateur graphic gives the title “KILLER” The credit
sequence continues “Written by ME Produced by ME
Directed by ME” All over a montage of frightened victims
of the Killer

MARTIN
Youve got to be kidding me What is
wrong with people

RAINS
The list is too long to enumerate

Horrifying shots of the young victim we saw in the closet
when he was alive and another a girl the same age Both
screaming Crying Pleading More bad title graphics
“Starring HIM and HER”

Then another woman appears about 30 in an extreme close
up hyperventilating and terrified “And HER” A hand
reaches into frame and knocks her down then the shot
cuts to the bathroom mirror APPLEGATE’s face comes into
frame dripping with water

APPLEGATE
(on the monitor)
And me

RAINS
That the guy

Martin nods The shot changes to a hand-held close up of
Applegate cleaned up mid-to-late 30’s average looking
wearing a Polo-style golf shirt

APPLEGATE
Hello Detective Martin

Everyone’s attention perks up again

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Do you ever go to the movies A lot
of people think movies are just to
entertain but that’s bs I mean what
is entertainment Just distraction
A lot of things are distracting

Through Applegate’s speech Steiner’s camera will move
between the monitor Martin Rains and Lorento
APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Distraction is meaningless No for a
movie to have meaning to really be
worth your time it has to make you
feel That’s what people are missing
in their lives Feeling They cover
up their feelings with distractions
Video games drugs sex fast food
loud music late nights crime
perversion All because they think
those things will make them feel
something anything but numb We’re
all so numb She’s feeling right now

He spins the camera around and shows a woman about 30
bound and gagged terrified

APPLEGATE (VO) (CONT’D)
She’s feeling fear That’s a feeling

MARTIN (VO)
Who’s she

The shot swings back on Applegate

APPLEGATE
You feel don’t you Detective
Martin I hope so It’s why you’re
here I need your help I need an
ending that’s gonna be meaningful and
by meaningful I mean really make me
feel something Can you help me with
that Detective Martin Help me find
feeling If you can you might be
able to save her

Applegate moves so that he and his captive are in the
shot together

APPLEGATE (VO) (CONTD)
I’m mean killing is just a distraction
like all the others Why am I a killer
if not to fill my empty life with
meaning But hell if I can get the
meaning from you maybe I won’t have to
kill for it What do you think
Detective Can we help each other

RAINS
He sure took a liking to you

The image dissolves from Applegate’s face to shots of
weddings Several shots of different couples at different
altars The music segues to sappy wedding video music
MARTIN
We know who the woman is

RAINS
(to Lorento)
Let’s get a frame grab out See if we
can ID her

MARTIN
She might not even be alive Who
knows when he made this He could be
completely fucking with us

RAINS
He might be doing that also I guess
well find out

The wedding videos become a collage of different wedding
pictures from different weddings all layered over each
other Then a “film burn” effect starts in the center and
burns up all the photographs

The police camera pushes into the monitor and we go FULL
FRAME into Applegate’s film

INT DINING ROOM - DAY 3

Two fixed camera angles No movement One from the front
door shooting down through the house toward the back The
other closer from within the dining room showing a
couple TODD and STACY late’s 20 standing as if waiting
for something looking around

Stacy is the woman that Applegate has bound and gagged in
his video She idly plays with a pendant on a gold chain
around her neck

The room is very clean Just the table with a plant An old
painting on the wall Nothing personal Nothing “homey”

Applegate dressed like a golfer in dockers and a
brightly colored Polo-style knit comes out of the
kitchen carrying a cup of coffee

APPLEGATE
You sure I can’t get you anything

STACY
No Thank you though

APPLEGATE
It’s fresh

TODD
We’re good

Applegate exits the dining room They follow

INT SECOND BEDROOM - DAY

The very room the cops are in Again fixed camera
positions though in here each shot shoots the opposing
camera on a tripod They fit right in among the shelves
of other video equipment We start to get a feel for how
Applegate has filmed himself

STACY
I’m so excited

She holds onto Todd’s arm bubbling He smiles down at
her Gives her a quick kiss

APPLEGATE
It’s not as far along as I hoped it
would be
STACY
Oh Well how far
APPLEGATE
About half
TODD

Half We wanted to show it to our
parents this weekend

APPLEGATE
I’m sorry Just see what you think
and if you like where I’m going
youll understand why it’s taking so
long Do you mind if I um

He picks up a handheld video camera
APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Sometimes it’s nice to get your
reactions when you first see the
video
They are very awkward with this
STACY
I’m not really prepared to be on

camera

She shies behind her husband touching her hair awkwardly

APPLEGATE
It’ll be okay I promise If it’s not
it won’t get cut into anything
There’s a ton of footage from every
wedding that never gets used Id
never get hired again if I did

They begrudgingly acquiesce He lifts the camera and this
adds a third angle to the scene

Applegate presses a button on the keyboard and a WEDDING
VIDEO begins to play on the monitor It shows Stacy
putting her wedding dress on in a nice bedroom She
curtsies for the camera Then Todd in his tuxedo making
the “Hang Loose” sign with both hands

Stacy elbows him

STACY
Goose

Fancy graphics on the monitor show the images come together
in a split screen then the title “Todd and Stacy September
19 2009 Married in a moment Happy for a lifetime”

ON THE HANDHELD SHOT OF THEM

STACY (CONT’D)
Oh that’s so cute Did you make that
up

APPLEGATE (VO)
You like it

STACY
It’s adorable
(to Todd)
Married in a moment Happy for a
lifetime Isn’t that cute

TODD
(teasing her)
It’s adorable

She scowls at him He kisses her

APPLEGATE
What’s that you’re playing with

He means the pendant on the chair
STACY

Isn’t is cute It’s a dolphin My
favorite A wedding gift

Clearly from Todd She gives him a kiss Applegate ZOOMS
IN on the dolphin pendant

APPLEGATE (VO)
I’1l try and work dolphins into the
video

STACY
Oh that’d be great

The handheld shot swishes to the floor and cuts back to
the wide angle

APPLEGATE
You like dogs You want to meet my
dogs They’re in the other room
Cutest things You want to meet ‘em
Come on

STACY
Can we just keep watching

APPLEGATE
Sure I’m just gonna check on ‘em Be
back in a sec

They keep watching the video He exits

INT HALLWAYBEDROOM - DAY 5

Cutting back to the handheld shot on the hallway carpet
then rising into Applegate’s POV as it enters the BEDROOM
(CONTINUOUS)

The shot turns toward the CLOSET where we saw the dead
body Applegate’s hand reaches in and opens the closet

Inside are two captives One is the dead man we saw
CHRIS and the other a girl ELLEN also around 20 (we
saw her in the “title sequence” Both are alive though
gaunt and weak with unhealed wounds on their faces Each
has a leg and an arm chained to a concrete wall

Their clothes are dirty Torn in places Both are barefoot

A shelf too high for them to reach has another camera
mounted on it When the handheld angle cuts to a shot of
Applegate holding the camera behind him we see a third
camera in the room on a tripod that has a wide angle of
the whole room and closet

APPLEGATE
Good “quiet” Good “quiet”
He reaches into his pocket and tosses a piece of beef
jerky to each of them

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Wait

A pause for a few beats then

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Okay

Each grabs for the jerky and eats it ravenously
APPLEGATE (CONTD)
We’re having company tonight Are you
going to be good

Neither answers

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Speak Are you going to be good

ELLEN
(timid slow)
Yyes
APPLEGATE
No talking
ELLEN

No
The handheld swings onto Chris

APPLEGATE
Are you going to be good

Chris nods

APPLEGATE (CONT’D)
Speak

CHRIS
I’1l be good Quite

APPLEGATE
Good

He tosses in two more pieces of jerky

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Wait Okay

They eat Applegate closes the closet door The shot cuts
to one INSIDE THE CLOSET low on the two captives lit by
the daylight from a small high window Chris and Ellen
pause Look at each other So much said between their
eyes They keep eating

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
Applegate is at the front door with Todd and Stacy

STACY
I love it He’s mad that it’s not
ready but I love it

APPLEGATE
I hope you love it I made you look
like a princess

STACY
What What does that mean

APPLEGATE
I told you a lot of stuff doesn’t
get used You had your moments

STACY
—
APPLEGATE
Don’t worry What matters is you love
it right
TODD
When will it be done
APPLEGATE
Next week
TODD

You said that last week We paid you
cash man come on don’t string us
out like this

APPLEGATE
You wanna meet my dogs They’re so
cute

TODD

We don’t want to see your dogs We
just want our video Okay

Applegate nods

APPLEGATE
Okay I promise Next week She loves
it Focus on that Don’t focus on the
meaningless stuff She loves it It
makes her happy That’s a feeling
That’s what’s important

Stacy is all smiles and pulls Todd out Applegate closes
the door

JUMP CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The same wide angle from the far corner though now it is
night On the jump cut Applegate literally disappears
from where he is standing at the door and reappears in
nicer clothes on the other side of the frame walking
toward the door We hear knocking

He opens it for SHEILA early 30s attractive in a “nice
girl” kind of way Jeans A sweater Cute

SHEILA
Hey

APPLEGATE
Hey

SHEILA

Sorry I’m late Traffic Ugh

A peck on the lips She lays her purse on the lamp table
looks around

SHEILA (CONTD)
Nice place I was beginning to think
you had something to hide

APPLEGATE
No I just like to be sure before I
invite someone over

SHEILA
Oh What are you sure about

APPLEGATE
(teasing charming)
I’m not sure

She smiles likes the flirting

SHEILA
Smells good What’re we having
APPLEGATE
Surprise
SHEILA

I like surprises

APPLEGATE
Oh I’ve got plenty in me

SHEILA
I like that too

She pulls him in for a deep kiss

MARTIN (VO)
Who do we think she is

RAINS (VO)
Looks like they’ve known each other
for awhile

LORENTO (VO)
So gross

The kiss ends

SHEILA
No fair

APPLEGATE
What

SHEILA

You opened that bottle of wine

APPLEGATE
How do you know

SHEILA
I can taste it

APPLEGATE
You can taste the wine on my lips

SHEILA
Yes Get me some

He heads out of the room toward the kitchen

SHEILA (CONT’D)
Can I put on some music

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 8

A smash cut to Applegate in the kitchen looking toward
the living room waving the finger back “through” the
wall and mouthing angrily “fuck you fuck you fuck
you” cranking his arm each time for emphasis

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 9
A different camera angle from near the front door shows

Applegate returning from the kitchen with two glasses of
wine Sheila is at the stereo

SHEILA
It’s not working

APPLEGATE
No

SHEILA

Am I doing it right

MARTIN (VO)
Hold on

INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT 10
On Martin Rains and Lorento watching the video

MARTIN
Go back

Lorento hits rewind The image shows Applegate flipping
his girlfriend off in reverse then gets back to the
original living room shot

MARTIN (CONTD)
Stop it

The shot freezes just as Applegate was walking out

MARTIN (CONTD)
Where’s the camera

RAINS
What

MARTIN
When he was in the bedroom we saw the
camera on the shelf in the closet and
the one behind him on the tripod
(MORE )

MARTIN (CONTD)
But that angle of him coming out of
the kitchen that was from the door

Sure enough the corner near the door is empty

Martin runs out of the room Rains follows The cameraman
runs after them the shot bouncing erratically all the
way into the LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 11

The shot hurries in and settles on Detective Martin’s back

near the corner by the door It pushes in closer to see his
fingers prodding along the wall until one finally pushes in
some fresh putty A hole goes all the way through

MARTIN
He hid the camera
(to Officer Aimes)
Look in that corner

The shot swings around to show Aimes go to the far corner
where the other living room shot was coming from It only
takes him a moment to find another hole in the wall

AIMES
Yep

The camera swings back onto Martin and Rains

MARTIN
He had the whole house rigged Hidden
cameras all over the place I bet
(to Aimes)
See if you can find more holes like
this

AIMES
Yes sir

Aimes moves off for the search Martin takes in the house

MARTIN
He’s a sick fuck

RAINS
No more’n the rest of ‘em I guess

INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT 12

Martin Rains and Lorento come back to the editing desk
The movie is still frozen Lorento hits play We see
Applegate walking out of the living room again

SHEILA
Can I put on some music

RAINS
Fast forward

It fast-forwards through the flipping-off in the kitchen
then Applegate coming back into the living room with the
wine They fast-talk through a few lines then it cuts
into the DINING ROOM where they are having dinner

RAINS (CONTD)
There

Regular “play”

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 13
A nice meal Candle light Static shots

SHEILA
(agitated)
I was clearly waiting for that spot
for like five minutes Zip right in
front of me Took me ten minutes to
find another spot and then--

The audio cuts out and bad white title graphics appear on
the screen “BLAH BLAH BLAH” as Sheila continues talking
MOS “BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH” on the screen plastered
over her face like tape Then the audio returns

SHEILA (CONT’D)
the store is closed Can you
believe it after all that Ugh I
was so pissed--

APPLEGATE
Ugh

SHEILA
What Are you making fun of me

APPLEGATE
I would never

SHEILA
I’m just sharing my day with you No
need to get hysterical

APPLEGATE
Do I look hysterical Do you know
what hysterical looks like

SHEILA
I know what hysterical means

APPLEGATE
It means delirious manic raging
mad Do I look raging mad to you

Though he’s not “raging mad” there is an intensity and
directness to his question She just stares at him

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
You ever consider the word “hysterectomy”
Same root as “hysterical” Hyster Which
means womb Look at that The medical term
used to describe a woman’s reproductive
organs is the same term used to describe
someone as delirious or mad You know why
Because doctors believed that it was a
woman’s reproductive organs that gave rise
to the unstable emotions we associate with
hysteria And that by removing a womans
womb in a hysterectomy you’d also be
removing the thing that makes women nuts

A long beat staring her down She’s frozen Then he
smiles letting her off the hook

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Ready for dessert

SHEILA
You’re an asshole sometimes

APPLEGATE
You like it

He clears the plates leaving us on her face A twinkle

in her eye She does like it

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT 14
They are in bed having sex Straight mish Blankets over

them His face tucked into the nook of her neck She
looks a little bored

APPLEGATE
Good quiet

SHEILA
What

APPLEGATE

I said it’s good Quiet

SHEILA
Yeah

They move like that He looks over at the closet door and
smirks ever-so-subtly

SHEILA (CONTD)
You want to try something else

APPLEGATE
Something else

SHEILA
We’ve been seeing each other more
than a month I thought maybe
another position

APPLEGATE
You don’t like it like this

SHEILA
I do It’s just you know why not
move around a little

She eases him up and rolls over onto her stomach His
eyes go wide More than shocked Perhaps even offended

APPLEGATE
In your--

SHEILA
-- No Just regular but like this
From behind You’ve never done it
like this

He looks so scared So innocent She puts a hand him

SHEILA (CONT’D)
You’re so sweet sometimes It’s okay

He awkwardly lays down over her back and they start
grinding slowly She reaches an arm back behind his head
and moans He starts to like it

SHEILA (CONTD)
You like it

APPLEGATE
Uh huh

He’s moving faster Harder She likes it

SHEILA
Uh oh Have I created a monster

APPLEGATE
You just opened the cage

SHEILA
I wish I had sooner

Moan Moan He’s thrusting hard now

APPLEGATE
What else do you like

SHEILA
What do you like

APPLEGATE
I bet you want another girl here with
us don’t you

That breaks her rhythm but he doesn’t stop

SHEILA
Another girl

APPLEGATE
Don’t you want another girl here You
could eat her pussy while I fuck you
from behind
He wraps her hair in his hand and pulls on it

SHEILA
Ow Stop

APPLEGATE
What’s a matter

SHEILA
You’re hurting me

Thrust Thrust Thrust

SHEILA (CONT’D)
Stop Get OFF

She throws him off and scrambles out of bed

SHEILA (CONTD)
What the fuck

APPLEGATE
What

She’s reaching for her clothes
APPLEGATE (CONTD)
I’m sorry It was just I thought

you wanted it

SHEILA
For you to hurt me

She pulls on her jeans

APPLEGATE
sit

She pulls on her top

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
I said sit

SHEILA
What am I a fucking dog

She’s out into the living room He follows The shot
stays in the bedroom showing them by the door

APPLEGATE
I’m sorry Come on I thought you’d
like it I’m sorry

He holds her shoulder She shrugs him off and opens the
door

SHEILA
I’1l1 call you later

And out He stands there in shock and shame fury rising
He marches back into the bedroom past the shot so that
all we see is the empty bedroom looking toward the empty

living room We hear the closet door open

APPLEGATE
Bad Bad

The sound of beatings The sound of crying and fear
Mabye only 20-30 seconds of it but it seems like forever

THEN CUT TO

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT 15

The girl Ellen is in a blood-filled bathtub naked
Applegate bathes her arm gently A high wide shot over
their backs

APPLEGATE
I love you You know I love you
right
(she doesn’t answer)
Do you love me
(still no answer)
Speak

Still no answer We finally realize she is dead

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
I love you

He lowers the one arm into the bloody water Lifts the other

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 16

Applegate sits on the bare wood floor in the middle of
the living room in front of a lit fire Legs curled up to
him in a ball Sobbing

Then a very melodramatic FADE TO BLACK with horribly over-
the-top self-romanticized music

RAINS (V0)
Turn it off

INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT 17

The handheld shot pulls back from the black monitor It
swings past a close up of Lorento her face showing how
shaken she is then falls on Martin and Rains Both of
their faces register that they know now that Ellen didn’t
get away

RAINS
What say we take a little break

Lorento moves out of the room Rains takes out a pack of
gum and offers a piece to Martin

He doesn’t even register it He takes out his cell phone
and exits Martin turns the proffered stick of gum toward
the cameraman Steiner

RAINS (CONTD)
Why don’t you give that a rest too

The cameraman lays the camera on a table still on but
with the shot skewed and sideways

OFFICER STEINER mid-20’s is seen for the first time as he
moves into the shot with Rains to take the chewing gum

STEINER
Pretty fucked up huh

RAINS
Yup

STEINER

What’s up with him
A nod over his shoulder out the door

RAINS
You mean “Detective Martin”

STEINER
(a bit rebuked)
Yeah He seems edgy

RAINS
Can’t reach his daughter She’s
upstate in college Hasn’t heard from
her in a couple of weeks

STEINER
Shit Gotta make it hard to see all
this

RAINS

Now you know why he’s edgy

STEINER
Right I’m a

RAINS
You do that

Steiner exits squeezing through the doorway past Martin
as he returns

RAINS (CONTD)
You call her

Martin nods

RAINS (CONTD)
Anything

Martin shakes his head

RAINS (CONTD)
Shell turn up Probably skiing or
something You know up in the
mountains no cell coverage She got
a boyfriend

MARTIN
Can we get back to it

RAINS
Yeah Sure

Rains goes to the computer futzes around a little until
he figures out the play button

INT BATHROOM - DAY 18
Going FULL SCREEN The black FADES UP ON

Applegate looks at himself in the bathroom mirror We can
see the camera on the tripod behind him He’s been crying
all night He rinses his face and lets it drip

INT SECOND BEDROOM - DAY 19

Shooting over Applegate’s shoulder onto the editing
station where he is working on Todd and Stacy’s wedding
video The shot on the monitor is of Stacy breaking down
into tears yelling at one of her bridesmaids

STACY
This isn’t blue Come on Jen it’s
not blue does this look blue to you

JEN (0S)
It looks blue

STACY
It’s not fucking blue It’s lavender
or Navy or something but it’s not
blue

JEN (VO)
Navy is blue

The shot on screen cuts to Todd with his BEST MAN
tuxedoes on toasting with a couple of beers

BEST MAN
Married

TODD
Married

BEST MAN

How’s it feel to know you’1ll never
get another blow job

TODD
What are you kidding Stacy love to
suck cock

BEST MAN
When you say “I do” they say “I
don’t”

TODD

Fuck that She stops sucking my cock
I walk And licking my balls Ball
licking is mandatory

It’s playful guy talk Not like an asshole We like him
They toast and smile

Like before in the “cute” video the two shots come
together in a split screen Stacy and Todd side-by-side in
a two-second loop where she says “Blue” and he says
“Balls” “Blue” “Balls” Faster and faster “Blue balls
“Blueballs”

The doorbell rings Applegate stops the playback

He spins on his chair so his face comes into view His
eyes are red and puffy from crying last night He stands
and exists frame

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 20

Applegate answers the door Todd and Stacy She notices
his weary face

STACY
Hey you okay

Applegate just nods

TODD
So is it ready

APPLEGATE

Yeah Just finished Coffee
TODD

We’re good
APPLEGATE

I’1l meet you back there I’m gonna

He slumps toward the kitchen dragging his feet
shoulders hunched Stacy gives Todd a concerned look

INT SECOND BEDROOM - DAY

Applegate is in the room with them They’ve clearly
already seen the footage Stacy is crying Todd is
furious

TODD
What the fuck Seriously Are you

APPLEGATE

STACY

TODD
No we’re not going We paid him five
thousand dollars Cash For this

APPLEGATE
Money This is about money for you
Here Here’s money

He opens a desk drawer that’s full of cash He pulls it
all the way out and throws it at Todd spilling cash all
over the place

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
People and their fucking money Life
isn’t money Money is an illusion
The same illusion you want this video
to be A vanity A falsehood

TODD
Fuck you man

He gathers cash from around him quickly counting about
what he’s owed

TODD (CONT’D)
Let’s go

He turns a little bit to take Stacy’s hand When he turns
back Applegate smashes him across the face with the
coffee mug It breaks cutting him and dousing him in
scalding coffee He screams hands to his face

Stacy screams

Applegate throws Todd to the floor (where his body falls
just off the bottom of the frame) He kicks at him Stacy
is the main shot behind Todd curled into the wall
wailing crying

Applegate looks around spots a crystal paperweight and
palms it He brings it down on Todd (also off screen)

When his hand and the paper weight come back up they
have blood on them Stacy scream and cries Another blow
Hand back up into the foreground more blood

Smash smash smash and stop

Reverse onto Applegate bloodstained fire in his eyes
staring at Stacy who is in shock

APPLEGATE
I’m sorry It’s been a rough day One
of my dogs died last night
Beat then
APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Want to see her

Applegate tosses Stacy into kitchen She’s scared

STACY

beneath the counter and fits a key into a U-bolt on the
handles He opens the cabinet to reveal Ellen’s body
stuffed inside He pulls her out Stacy SCREAMS

ear He waits for the ring For the answering message

MARTIN
Gina it’s dad Baby I really need
you to call me

He’s trying to keep it together Trying to hold in the
emotion The handheld shot zooms in for a close-up

MARTIN (CONT’D)
It’s been two weeks and I’m freaking
out I really need you to call me
okay baby Gina Okay
(turns back into the shot
wiping his face)
Okay I love you

everyone else is looking at him He walks out of the
kitchen

As he shoves her down the hallway Stacy sees Todd dead
on the floor in the editing room behind them

Applegate palms the side of her head and smashes it
against the wall She stops screaming but keeps crying

The blow broke her gold necklace which falls to the
floor with the dolphin pendant

Applegate opens the closet Stacy sees Chris inside and
the open chains beside him

screaming and pleading

He slams the closet door shut On the slam we cut into

INT CLOSET - DAY
Chris and Stacy

STACY

Why Why the hell aren’t you

screaming
(loud out the door)
Let me out you fuck Goddamn you

CHRIS
Hell beat me Shh Shh please
When one of us isn’t quiet he beats
the other Please Please

He’s almost in tears with the memory of his last beating
whenever that was She sees the wounds all over him and
calms down

STACY
I’m sorry I

She gives a little nod The first step of acquiescence
Her hand goes reflexively to where the pendant would be
and she realizes it’s gone She panics a little looking
around her

CHRIS
What
STACY
(still teary)
Nothing How long how long have

you been here
His face says he doesn’t know exactly

CHRIS
I sleep a lot It’s--

Whatever thought that was he doesn’t have words for it

CHRIS (CONTD)
What day is it

STACY

getting an anniversary video for our
parents They were married on

Stacy’s free hand jerks involuntarily to her mouth and
her face shows regret He reads it

CHRIS (CONTD)

She nods

STACY
I’m sorry

Chris’ eyes show the pain
CHRIS
It’s better She’s better she’s
better now Ellen My little
ballerina We’re twins Were She
used to dance
He makes a finger twirl as if referencing a ballerina
CHRIS (CONTD)
When we were kids She pretend to be
a ballerina and I’d be her audience
A distant smile of recollection Then more pain a few
sobs which he covers with his free hand Then he stops
wipes his eyes looks at Stacy

CHRIS (CONT’D)
You came with someone I heard a man

Reality comes back to Stacy now No tears Too much shock

STACY

wall It’s strong She sinks A beat Then looks up

STACY

Still shakes his head

CHRIS
No He doesn’t think of us like that

He brought her back and---

He drifts off

STACY

tightening like sail-ropes in a hurricane He shakes his
head cannot speak

paper the lease Rain falls behind them

MRS BIJAN
I only met him the day he signed the
lease He was a nice man Dressed
like a golfer Reminded me of my
nephew the doctor

RAINS
Charles Winters Moved in eight
months ago

MARTIN
Think this one’s real

Rains shrugs hands the paper to Aimes

RAINS
Run it
(to Mrs Bijan)
Did you ever do a walk-through while
he lived here Notice anything
personal Mail Pictures Anything at
all

MRS BIJAN
Last time I was here was the day I
met him He paid his rent on time In
cash No complaints from or about
him You know I bet you hear this all
the time but I just can’t believe he
did the things you say

MARTIN
Did he give you any ID when you
rented to him

She shakes her head

MARTIN (CONTD)
A social security number

Another shake

MARTIN (CONTD)
You didn’t do a credit check

MRS BIJAN
He paid cash Six months in advance
You know how many tenants with great
credit have skipped out on me

RAINS
All right Anything else you think we
should know

MRS BIJAN
Well I sold the place

RAINS
Sold it When

MRS BIJAN
Just last month Escrow closes in
sixty days New owners applied for re-
zoning I think they’re building low
income apartments on the whole block

MARTIN
(to Rains)
So he’s getting kicked out

RAINS
Why not just disappear Why leave the
video

Martin doesn’t have an answer Then his cell phone rings
He looks at it moves off the porch into the front yard
remaining in the background We can hear that he is
speaking but not understand anything he’s saying

RAINS (CONTD)
All right ma’am Thanks for coming
out so late

MRS BIJAN
Do you know when I’1ll get to rent the
house again

RAINS
For two months

MRS BIJAN
Two months rent is two months rent
Vacation renters pay by the week

A “low battery” light begins to flash in the corner of
the screen

STEINER (VO)
Shit

RAINS
I don’t know ma’am It depends on
how long the investigation takes
This is a crime scene now A murder
scene

MRS BIJAN
Thank God I already sold it I can’t
imagine what that would’ve done to
the market price

Martin comes back up the steps

RAINS
All right thanks again for co--

The screen goes black

MARTIN
Heather Please She didn’t trust me

RAINS

Thank you

RAINS
But you’re a great father And even
your bitch of an ex knows there’s no
one on Earth who’s gonna work longer
or harder to make sure her daughter
shows up safe

MARTIN
(more humbly)
Thank you
RAINS

Martin walks away Applegate closes the door and looks at
the business card He takes a pen from his pocket and
writes on the back of it

INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT
Rains is looking at the business card reading the back

RAINS
“He knows how I feel”

MARTIN
Fuck that
(to the monitor)
Fuck you I don’t know how you feel

Martin rips the monitor down smashing it to the floor
where it breaks in a spark The handheld swishes down
onto it then back up onto Martin furious

MARTIN (CONTD)
Get that thing the fuck out of my
face

He reaches in at the camera and the image is blackened
and blurred in the struggle

STEINER
Hey what are you doing

RAINS (VO)

The image clarifies as Rains pulls Martin back away from
the camera We see Lorento in the side of the frame
frightened
RAINS (CONT’D)

MARTIN
It’s fucking annoying

STEINER (0S)
I’m just doing my job

MARTIN
You have no fucking idea what is

RAINS

But so is this

A longer beat The tension ebbs

RAINS (CONTD)
And I’m sure she’s fine Maybe her
cell phone’s out Maybe she went
somewhere on vacation But she’s
fine And I need you to focus

Rains reaches out a comforting hand toward Martin’s arm
He shrugs him off and exits the room

STEINER (0S)
That guy’s losing it

RAINS
Don’t start

STEINER (0S)
He attacked me

RAINS
He’s under a lot of stress

STEINER (0S)

The way he’s messing with him
Taunting him I mean all of this is
for him it just seems so obvious that--

RAINS
Shut if off

STEINER (VO)
How can you ignore--

Rains puts a hand over the lens The camera powers down

INT HOUSE - NIGHT 39

The shot comes back WITH NO LIGHT looking out a window
into the backyard showing the garage in the background
with a light above the doors illuminating the area The
rain has stopped

In the foreground standing near a patio table is
Detective Martin on the phone We realize that Steiner is
shooting him without his knowledge

MARTIN

RAINS (CONTD)
I ah I’m sorry about asking this
sorry before I even say it

MARTIN
Then don’t say it

RAINS
Have to According to your notes you
came to Applegate’s door seventeen
days ago When was Gina supposed to
come home

MARTIN
He doesn’t have her

RAINS
The guy’s clearly taken a interest in
you You said Gina was coming home
from school then she disappears
Maybe she got here and he--

MARTIN
He doesn’t have Gina Just drop it
all right He doesn’t have her

He bumps past Rains angry shaken

The shot lowers down from the window and bounces as if
Officer Steiner has just sat with the camera on his lap
The frame is just of the wall and an edge of the window
he was just shooting through

STEINER (VO)
Fuck

The shot goes black as he turns the camera off Then it
comes back on in the same spot but no longer in record
mode Now in video mode A double “rewind” arrow appears

The shots plays backward through the candid shot of
Martin through the window until it reaches the shot of
the broken monitor on the floor by Steiner’s feet

The indicator becomes a “stop” square The camera turns
off Black again

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 41

A wide shot from the door shows the dining table is set
for dinner Candlelight Soft music

Another angle shows Sheila on the couch She is dressed
nicely but her mood is cool She sips at a glass of wine
as Applegate finishes setting a log on the fire

APPLEGATE
I’m glad you came over

SHEILA
I’m still mad You hurt me You
scared me

APPLEGATE
I know That’s why I invited you
over To apologize

He hands her a small wrapped present That softens her

SHEILA

APPLEGATE
Open it

She unwraps the gift It’s a long jewelry box We should
see this coming She opens it and of course it is the
gold chain with the dolphin pendant

SHEILA

silverware He agrees with a little nod

STACY (CONT’D)

CHRIS (CONTD)
No Just be quiet Good quiet

STACY
Don’t “good quiet” me I’m not a
goddamn dog and neither are you We

CHRIS
And what

He yanks on the chains in the wall

CHRIS (CONTD)
So whoever it is comes to the closet
and sees this And what do you think
he’s going to do He’s going to kill
them You want to kill them

She knows he’s right She slumps down and emotion
returns Fear

STACY
We can’t just what do we do just
stay here and wait to die

A long beat of silence She starts to cry

STACY (CONTD)

I miss my dad He walked me down the
aisle he was so proud He had he
had this tiny little yellow box I
love yellow He gave it to me just
before we walked out You know what
it was A Cracker Jack ring

(she laughs through her tears)
He said “some rings a groom gives to
his bride and some a daddy gives to
his little girl”

INT EDITING ROOM - NIGHT 43

The camera swings off the monitor to Martin’s stoic face
Whatever he’s feeling he’s not showing it The camera
swings back to the monitor

The scene has cut to the dining room

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 44

Sheila is seated at the table set beautifully Applegate
comes from the kitchen with the main platter of the meal
Roasted chicken pasta vegetables He really went all
out It looks great

SHEILA
Wow Impressive I’m going to get mad
at you more often

APPLEGATE
Please no
SHEILA
I didn’t know you cooked
APPLEGATE
You don’t know a lot of things about
me
SHEILA

Like you like threesomes
It’s a dig He pauses looks at her

APPLEGATE
Do you want to have a nice dinner

A beat She nods Puts on a smile Scoots a little closer
to him The coolness dissipates

SHEILA
I’m sorry This looks amazing

APPLEGATE
You look amazing

SHEILA
Thank you

She leans him to kiss him A longer one than on the
couch She breaks away with a smile then reaches for
her glass of wine There’s just a sip left She finishes
it and stands

SHEILA (CONTD)
There more wine

APPLEGATE
Ill get it

SHEILA
It’s okay

She takes his glass also and exits

45 INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 45
Entering the kitchen messy with pots and pans Sheila
spots the wine bottle on the counter She also spots the
U-bolt on the cabinet handles below the counter

46 INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 46

She returns to Applegate with the wine and curiosity on
her face She sits at the table He’s eating She’s not

APPLEGATE
What’s a matter

SHEILA
Nothing

APPLEGATE

Eat I mean try it Dig in
She takes a couple of bites

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Good

She nods

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
What is it

A beat She takes a sip of her wine The U-bolt is
clearly on her mind though she won’t spit it out

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
What

SHEILA
It’s nothing

APPLEGATE
Come on we just made up don’t put
something else between us

SHEILA
Well it’s ah

She glances at the locked cabinet behind him He looks
over his shoulder and sees what she’s looking at

APPLEGATE
A man can’t lock a cabinet in his own
house

SHEILA

No of course you can It’s just it’s
a big ol’ lock It makes me curious

APPLEGATE
Whatever it is if it’s locked it’s
probably private

SHEILA
Of course

A few bites of difficult silence

APPLEGATE
We’re not going to get to enjoy this
are we

SHEILA

I just I mean I could see a man
wanting to keep some things private
but maybe you’d put them in a drawer
or in the closet

APPLEGATE
In the closet

SHEILA
But that big lock out in the open it
almost well not almost it draws
attention to exactly the thing you’re
trying to hide

APPLEGATE
I’m not trying to hide anything I
don’t lock my closet

SHEILA
Right So I’m not curious about the
closet

APPLEGATE

But you’re curious about the cabinet

SHEILA
Well yeah

A beat Then he stands irritated
APPLEGATE
Fine Let’s go see what’s in the

cabinet

He turns toward the kitchen

SHEILA
No it’s okay

APPLEGATE
What’s okay

SHEILA

We don’t have to look I’m sorry I
didn’t mean to make such a big deal
about it

She stabs some pasta on her fork He takes his keys out
of his pocket and extends them to her

APPLEGATE
Go see what’s in the cabinet

A beat then she takes the keys and heads back into the
kitchen He turns and stands in the doorway watching her
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 47

Sheila bends down toward the cabinet He’s leaning at the
kitchen door silently watching her

She opens the bolt and slides it out pausing for a moment to
look over her shoulder at him His face is impassive She
opens the cabinet

There’s a box inside She looks back over her shoulder at
him A question on her eyes “Can I”

APPLEGATE
Open it But don’t be upset if you
find something you don’t like I had
it locked for a reason

She slides the box out onto the floor

SHEILA
It’s heavy

She opens the box Her eyes light up

SHEILA (CONTD)
Oh my God

She pulls out pictures Handfuls of old snapshots Even
an album that she flips through

SHEILA (CONTD)
What wouldn’t I like about this
(beep) All your old oh my god
you’re so cute

She looks at him

SHEILA (CONTD)
Why would you want to hide these
These are great

APPLEGATE
Good pictures Bad memories

Her face clouds

SHEILA
What bad memories

His face goes back to some ugly place He takes the
pictures from her hands and stuffs them back in the box

APPLEGATE
Can we put them away now You’ve seen
them Let’s put them away

SHEILA
Come on You can’t hide them away
now I’1l just be more curious

She pulls more pictures out even while he’s trying to
pack them up

SHEILA (CONTD)
Look at your hair I love it Is that
your mother

He freezes She looks at him with the question He nods

SHEILA (CONTD)
She was beautiful

APPLEGATE
Please let’s put them away

He’s trying to keep it together

SHEILA
What’s her name Where does she live
APPLEGATE
She’s not far from here
SHEILA
Can I meet her
APPLEGATE
You want to meet my mother
SHEILA
Id love to
APPLEGATE

Fine I’ll take you to meet my mother

SHEILA
Yes that’d be--

He smacks her hard across the face knocking her to the
tiled kitchen floor Blood breaks from her mouth She

sputters He lifts her by the hair and throws her into
the wall She bounces and falls He kicks her twice in
the gut leaving her in a ball gasping for air

Calmly he crosses off screen and a second or two later
comes back holding a large kitchen knife

She looks up in time to see him coming at her with the
knife In time to realize her danger to feel the fear

SHEILA (CONTD)
“(beep)” no I’m I’m sorry I--

She can only scramble further into the corner He stabs
at her

SHEILA (CONT’D)
No No No

The blade cuts her arm her hand Then his other hand
blocks her defenses and he gets a jab through The knife
sinks deeply into her shoulder She coughs in shock Her
face tightens She can barely expresses the pain

She looks down at the knife sticking out of her shoulder
He has let go of it so it’s just sticking there She
reaches for it

APPLEGATE
I wouldn’t--

Even as she touches it she feels the pain surge and pulls
her hand away crying now

SHEILA
What are you why what are you
doing

He falls back to a seated position just looking at her
there with the knife in her shoulder bleeding down her
blouse

APPLEGATE
January 16th 1991 was the day I lost
my virginity It wasn’t much I wish I
could say I had a girlfriend and we’d
spent two years falling in love and
all that but love wasn’t taught very
well in this house No one really
liked me in school I didn’t have any
friends Or girlfriends I was a
virgin They made fun of me for it

During his speech blood begins to pool around Sheila
Her face becomes more pale Her breathing slows

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Then on this day January the 16th a
guy comes to me and says if I pay him
50 that this girl would have sex
with me It wasn’t like he was a
teenage pimp of she was a teenage
prostitute or anything like that
There was a bet He bet her fifty
dollars that she wouldn’t sleep me
with me so she said she would

(MORE )

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
He knew he’d have to pay her the
fifty dollars if she did so he
figured he’d get it from me Well I
paid of course And we had sex I
wasn’t circumcised I didn’t know I
wasn’t circumcised I didn’t know
what circumcision was so when she
said “you have a foreskin” I didn’t
know what she meant I asked her to
explain but she just laughed at me
She laughed the whole time we were
having sex

Sheila slumps to her side Still alive but life fading

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
That night I asked my mother I said
“whats a foreskin” You know what
she said She said “why don’t you
want yours” I still didn’t know what
it was so I said “I don’t know” She
said “well if you don’t want it
that’s fine” She took knife from the
kitchen that one in fact She told
me to lie down on the floor She told
me to remove my pants And she
circumcised me I bled everywhere my
God I bled so much When she’d
finished she held the piece of skin
up to my face and said “There
that’s a foreskin”

He leans forward and pulls the knife from Sheila’s
shoulder Blood pulses out over her chest She crumbles
eyes fluttering gasping for air for life

Applegate rips off the gold chain with the dolphin
pendant He exits the kitchen She tries to crawl tries
to move but can’t really go anywhere

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Come on Let’s go meet my mother

He scoops her up into his arms and carries her out of the
room out of frame leaving us to look at the blood
stained floor

INT BASEMENT UNDER GARAGE - NIGHT

The trap door in the ceiling of the basement opens
revealing light above though it is dark below

The light is obscured as Applegate rolls Sheila’s body
over the hole then drops it She thuds to the floor

APPLEGATE
Mom Sheila

The trap door closes extinguishing the light

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 49

Applegate throws the broken chain into the fireplace and
just stands there

Lorento after wiping her face stops the playback

LORENTO

Rains nods She exits

MARTIN
It’s the mother down there The
skeleton
Rains nods again
RAINS

I think I’1ll take five myself

He heads out leaving Martin in there with Steiner A
long beat where the camera just holds on Detective Martin
as he stares at the computer monitor saying nothing
Then he looks directly at the camera

MARTIN
Lemme see that thing

STEINER (0S)
What

Martin holds his hand out

MARTIN
Gimme the camera

The shot swishes during the handoff then settles on Officer
Steiner squinting from the bright light in his face

MARTIN (0S) (CONTD)
How’s it feel

STEINER
I don’t--

MARTIN (0S)
You don’t like it do you

STEINER

of your footage by including your
personal pain on it

He gets it

STEINER
I’m sorry I shouldn’t have shot you

The camera swishes as Martin hands it back to Steiner
who sets it down on the couch so the shot is just of the
door and wall

STEINER (VO) (CONTD)
Ill turn it off

MARTIN (0S)
Pick it up

STEINER (0S)

MARTIN (0S)

Swish again and settle on Detective Martin who takes a
long beat gathering some words

MARTIN (CONTD)

STEINER (0S)

MARTIN

His head is held low staring down Then he stands and
walks out of frame

MARTIN (OS) (CONTD)
Erase that Erase it

STEINER (0S)
Yes sir

The camera stops

INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT 51

The camera is back on again Rains and Lorento re-enter

RAINS
They’re ordering some pizza Putting

Martin keeps his head turned away Just grunts a “yeah”

Lorento presses play

INT CLOSET - NIGHT 52
Stacy and Chris are silent tense

STACY
I don’t hear anything Do you hear
anything

He won’t speak

STACY (CONT’D)
We should--

The door opens Applegate is there covered in blood He
reaches in with his keys and unlocks Stacy’s arm She
kicks at him

STACY (CONT’D)
No no no

He smacks her hard across the face One two three
times She’s goes unconscious Chris just pulls back into
the wall as far as he can Applegate unlocks Stacy’s leg
and drags her out of the closet The door closes Chris
is alone again

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 53

A static shot Applegate sits at the dining room table
still set with the meal though the candles have burned
lower Stacy is in the other chair slumped still
unconscious

He shakes her awake She slowly comes to Gathers her
surroundings She jerks startled

APPLEGATE
It’s okay It’s okay Eat

She settles down frightened and cautious but not kicking
and screaming She looks at the meal

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Eat

She doesn’t move

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
It’s okay Eat

She’s nervous Hesitant There’s a fork She picks it up
slowly Takes a bite

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Is it good

A nod

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
How good is it

STACY
Very good

APPLEGATE
I’m glad you like it

He brushes a hair back from her face Looks at her

LORENTO (0S)
He’s elevating her

MARTIN (0S)
What

LORENTO (0S)
We did a case study like
this Serial killers
dehumanize their captives
so there is no moral issue
with how they treat them
Applegate thinks of his as
pets dogs but he’s
elevating her Sitting her
at the table Letting her
eat like a person Asking
her questions geared toward
validating himself

The off screen chatter stops

APPLEGATE

Would you like something to
drink Wine

(a beat Stacy doesn’t

answer)
ts my mother’s recipe
hat chicken She used to
ake if for me all the time
hen I was a kid I loved

bea ctH

(beat)
Maybe a soda You want a
soda

Stacy shakes her head

APPLEGATE
I had a son you know He died of
Cancer I didn’t cry His mother

cried She left me

I didn’t kill her

or anything in case you were
wondering My mother cried That
perplexed me I’d never seen my
mother cry over anything

(MORE )
APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Certainly never for me The very
woman who taught me what it looked
like to feel nothing was here
feeling over my son Maybe she was
faking it I don’t know All I know
is that I didn’t feel anything What
kind of a man doesn’t feel anything
at the death of his child You think
I’m crazy

A beat Her face shows her contemplation on whether to
answer or not

APPLEGATE (CONT’D)
You can answer

STACY
For real

He nods

STACY (CONTD)
I think you’re a fucking fruit bag

He laughs a little a quick snort with a smile

APPLEGATE
(somehow charming)
That’s colorful I should’ve expected
something witty after seeing all that
wedding footage of you

She drops her fork with a clatter

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
You don’t like it

STACY
Just enough with this stupid small
talk You’ve got me chained to a wall
in a closet What What Are you
going to kill me like you killed my
husband with a fucking coffee mug
You want me to be scared I’m scared
okay

Fear shows up in a few tears that she fights back

STACY (CONT’D)
I just
(wipes her face)
I want to go Can I go

She looks straight at him A long beat What’s he going
to say

APPLEGATE
How about dessert

She closes her eyes tightly The insanity He goes into
the kitchen

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
It’s good Chocolate cake Not my
mother’s Her chocolate cake was
never very good Too dry It’s just
out of a box but I made it myself

We hear the clatter of plates and silverware He comes
back out with a large piece of chocolate cake and a glass
of milk Sets both in front of her

STACY
Seriously You want me to eat
chocolate cake

APPLEGATE
Yes Eat

STACY
I’m not a fucking dog and I don’t
want any chocolate fucking cake

She throws the plate of cake against the wall It clatters
to the floor Applegate remains seated unreactive placid

APPLEGATE
You think I don’t know I’m a monster
I know People think that people like
me are totally disconnected from
reality

STACY
You’re a fucking lunatic

A beat Will he react to that He smiles As he speaks
he gets up to clean the chocolate cake

APPLEGATE
You know where that term comes from
Lunatic From the moon Lunar Luna
Early psychiatrists thought that
people’s emotional disturbances were
caused by lunar cycles like the tides

He sets the plate and most of the cake on the table He
takes napkins to wipe the rest of the cake and frosting

from the wall and floor

APPLEGATE (CONT’D)

It was usually applied to women whose
menstrual cycles were also thought to be
influenced by lunar cycles because they

came once a month
(he finishes sits)

Don’t you find that fascinating

He pauses for her answer but she says

nothing

APPLEGATE (CONT’D)
It’s not rhetorical I’m rarely

rhetorical

STACY

I’ve never thought about it

APPLEGATE

I’m not a lunatic Not in the padded-
room howl at the moon sense I’m
self-aware I know you’re not a dog
I know that I have human beings
chained in my closet who I treat like

dogs And I know that doing
things consciously makes me
monster

STACY
So why do you do them

He sighs eyes closing for a moment reflective

APPLEGATE

those
a

I have asked myself that question so

Many times

He stands collects the plates and goes back into the
kitchen She can see him through the kitchen door his

back to her as he does the dishes

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
I wasn’t a crazy kid I didn’t
torture animals or anything

Cutting to an angle showing Applegate’s face with a
glimpse through the kitchen door of the dining table

behind him Stacy nervously tries to stand without moving

her chair at all contorting herself up very slowly

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
My dad hit me but what dad doesn’t hit
his kid now and then I guess I deserved
it a couple of times Accidentally
busted the TV once running through the
house What dad wants to see his TV get
busted by his kid

She’s up shaking as she looks at him She moves slowly
around the table and out of frame

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
My mom wasn’t kind That’s true I
guess I had it worse than some kids but
not as bad as others She didn’t like
being talked back to that’s for sure
You wouldn’t have lasted very long in
this house

He tosses a smile over his shoulder as if he’s sharing
something cute with her but stops when he sees the empty
chair

REVERSE ANGLE

Of the dining room with him in the kitchen He runs out
fury on his face the faucet still running behind him He
looks one way then the other Runs that way

ANOTHER ANGLE

Across the dining table the back door is open Applegate
pushes through

We hear trash cans banging Frightened yells Dogs
barking A distant struggle

STACY (0S)
(far off and muffled)
No let me go Let me go Help

The cries get closer More trash cans banging louder
Applegate finally drags her back into the house
struggling and screaming and crying

STACY (CONT’D)
No please Please let me go I
won’t tell anyone I promise Please
please

He drags her off screen and

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT 54

into the bedroom still kicking and screaming He
opens the closet Chris looks up scurries back into the
wall as Applegate throws Stacy down and re-chains her

STACY
Please please

She keeps screaming and fighting

APPLEGATE
Quiet now QUIET

He kicks her She stops screaming and tries to suck up
her tears Still sobbing

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
(yelling)
You tried to run away

CHRIS
You ran

APPLEGATE
Why would you try to run away Don’t
I love you Don’t I

He takes a key from his pocket and unlocks Chris’s chains

CHRIS
What’d you do What did you do No No
I didn’t do anything I’ve been good

Applegate drags him from the closet As he pulls him up
Chris’s kicking hits the shelf that has the video camera
on it The camera gets knocked off and falls to the
floor landing in a skewed angle looking at Stacy

CHRIS (08 ) (CONTD)
No I didn’t do anything No

The shot stays with Stacy in the closet listening to Chris
scream watching as Applegate drags him out of the bedroom

She pulls herself into a ball crying as Chris’s screams
get bigger more intense more pain-filled

Then the screams just stop Silence Stacy rocks herself
knees pulled up arms across her chest in tears

STACY
No no no no no no no no no no no

She hears footsteps and tries to catch her breath The
bedroom door opens Then the closet door

The wider full room shot There is Applegate with Chris
He’s a mess Severely beaten He drops him to the floor
Thud Barely breathing

Applegate resets the fallen camera then puts the
shackles back on Chris’s ankle and wrist While he’s
still squatting there he looks right at Stacy

APPLEGATE
Maybe you’re right Maybe I ama
fucking lunatic

He stands and closes the closet door Stacy slowly
reaches out for Chris Touches his leg

STACY
I’m sorry I’m so sorry

His eyes flutter Weak and delirious

CHRIS
Ellen

Her lips pout and tremble His eyes close again A last
breath He dies She cries in pain and fear and sadness

STACY
I’m so sorry

She continues to cry until one of the policeman’s voices
breaks the scene

OFFICER AIMES (VO)

The video stops Goes black

INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

OFFICER AIMES
Sorry to interrupt

Everyone takes a deep breath Aimes hands a set of papers
to Rains

OFFICER AIMES (CONT’D)
The file on Charles Willard And the
food’s here Rain stopped so we set
it up outside

EXT BACK YARD - NIGHT 56

The shot reveals Rains and Martin in the backyard where
there are a few pizzas set on the patio table Neither
Martin nor Rains eat Rains reads the papers

RAINS

MARTIN
What
RAINS
Born October 6 1943
MARTIN
‘43 That’d make him almost seventy
RAINS
Another fake
MARTIN

No one at Motor Vehicles noticed this
guy wasn’t seventy when he came in to
get his picture taken

RAINS
They don’t exactly have PhD’s at
those counters

Martin grits his teeth in frustration His hand rests on
the back on his neck again

RAINS (CONTD)
What do we think about all that stuff
about wombs and moons

MARTIN
He’s obsessed with menstruation

RAINS
You just gonna crack wise detective

He rebukes Martin’s sarcasm with a glare Martin gives
in grabs a piece of pizza

MARTIN
Med school English major Or maybe
he just watched a lot of TV

LORENTO
He was in the system

RAINS
Hmm

LORENTO

Lunatic Hysteria Colorful old terms
for insanity Probably heard it all
on the psych wards

RAINS
And there’d be records of him on the
psych wards

MARTIN
If we knew his real name

Rains scowls Grabs a piece of pizza himself

RAINS

Here’s what I think about the Death
Penalty I say give the scumbags all
their due process Full jury trial
the right to an attorney all that
scumbags rights shit If they’re
convicted give ‘em a full sentencing
trial The whole nine yards jury of
their peers make it all tight as a
drum In the cases where there’s any
doubt I’m talking a shred of a hint
of a possibility of a mistake I’m not
talking reasonable doubt I’m talking
reasonable inkling no death penalty

He finishes up his pizza Wipes his hands Pours a coffee

RAINS (CONTD)
But in the cut and dry cases the
one’s where the school video camera
shows the shitbag smiling when he
unloads his modified AR-15 into a math
class in those cases when not a neck
in the world can even have a hair go
up when we say “that’s the guy who did
it” Then when that jury comes back
and says “death” you take him right
out back and shoot him in the head
Right then Right there No appeals
No twenty years eating on the tax
payer’s dime and getting better health
care Just bang Done Dead

MARTIN
Where’d that come from

RAINS
I don’t know Just felt like I had to
say it

MARTIN
Well you’re more generous than me

RAINS
A bullet in the head is generous

MARTIN
I’ve never been a big fan of due
process I’m gonna shoot this guy in
the head the second I see him

He takes a cup of coffee off the table and heads inside

Steiner turns the camera toward Rains

It’s in the closet
SAM
What
APPLEGATE

Just open the closet

Sam opens the closet There is Chris’s dead body dried
blood all around him And Stacy alive chained to the wall

SAM
What the fuck Yo dude what the
fu--

He spins to see Applegate swinging a metal pipe at him
He clocks him right across the face dropping him hard

Angle of Applegate walking toward Sam He grabs his sack

APPLEGATE
Look at the nuts

He moves in and starts beating him with the pipe Stacy
watches in numb fear No more tears No more screaming

Finished Applegate drops the pipe to the floor and hefts
Sam over his shoulder then walks out

Stacy is alone She hears the footsteps get further away
She hears the back door open and close

She sees the pipe on the floor a few feet away

She’s nervous Frightened She leans toward the pipe but
cant reach it She shifts and stretches her unchained
leg Not quite not quite then she gets a toe on it

It takes a lot of effort but she manages to slide ita
little bit enough to get her whole foot over it and draw
it towards her

She hears a dull “thud” from the distance and freezes No
other sound She picks up the pipe and tries to slip it
through the bolt on the lock It won’t fit too wide She
can fit it through a chain link though She puts it
through near the bolt and tries to pull

Nothing No matter how hard she strains it will not
budge the bolt No leverage

She begins to twist it knotting the chain up into a

ball When it gets tight enough she has some leverage on
the bolt in the wall and with effort begins to turn it
Concrete dust starts to flutter down She strains

grunts and gets it to loosen She tugs and it comes out
She fights back a gasp of joy One more bolt for the

chain on her arm She slides the pipe into the ring and
twists it up also

INT BASEMENT UNDER GARAGE - NIGHT 62
Sams body lays in the foreground of a shot in the
basement The trap door above closes The light around

the edges of the door goes out

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 63

Applegate comes back into the house through the back door

INT CLOSET - NIGHT 64

Stacy is still fighting with the bolt It’s not moving

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT 65
Applegate washes his hands in the bathroom sink Blood

and dirt run over the white porcelain basin

INT CLOSET - NIGHT 66

The bolt breaks free It seems really loud Stacy freezes

INT BATHROOM 67

Applegate hasn’t heard over the running water He turns
it off Dries his hand Looks at himself in the mirror

APPLEGATE
Look at the nuts

He smirks and laughs

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT 68

Stacy starts to ease the closet door open

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT 69

The doorbell rings Applegate goes through the hall
disappearing into the dining room

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT 70

Stacy moves very slowly out of the closet and into the
bedroom She can see light under the door that leads to
the living room and hear Applegate’s footsteps She looks
toward the door that leads into the hallway

In the silence the chains sound as loud as a train She

finds a jacket on a chair and wraps it around them as best
she can lugging the bundle as she crawls toward the door

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 71
Applegate opens the door to see the PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
(Whom we also recognize as the other dead male in the
basement the Latino with curly hair) He’s carrying one
of those thick padded “hot-sleeves” for delivery pizza
PIZZA DELIVERY GUY

Hey man I know this took forever

Traffic was like ugh They told me

to give you 25 off

APPLEGATE
No worries Lemme get my wallet

He reaches toward the bedroom door

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT 72

Stacy freezes when she sees feet block the light beneath
the closed door

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY (VO)
That it there
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 73

He points to the dining table where Applegate’s wallet
still sits near the poker chips and cards

APPLEGATE
Oh yeah We had a card game

He walks that way and fishes money out of his wallet

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT 74

Stacy opens the door looking into the dark hallway

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 75
Applegate gives the pizza guy a big tip

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
Thanks

APPLEGATE
Woulda cost me that anyway

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
That’s cool of you Most customers
just get pissed off when it’s late
blame me instead of the kitchen or
the traffic and chintz the tip

He starts to unzip the insulated carrying sleeve

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT 76

Stacy crawls toward the dining room

INT DINING ROOM LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 77

She eases herself through the door hugging the wall that
blocks her from the line of vision at the front door She
can see the back doors from where she is

She gets her head low and peeks around the corner She
sees Applegate from behind

The guy hands the pizza box over to Applegate

PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
Have a nice night huh And thanks
again

APPLEGATE
You got it

Stacy bolts for the back door One of the chains falls
loose from the coat and hits the floor with a clank

Applegate tosses a look over his shoulder sees Stacy
running around the dining table then looks back at the
Pizza Guy whose eyes are wide confused

Applegate drops the pizza and reaches for him just as he
runs down the porch Applegate runs after him

Stacy fumbles with the deadbolt on the back door but gets
it open and runs outside

The shots remains in the house empty Pizza box on the
floor We hear the pizza guy yelling and Applegate
grunting in the front Chains rattling in the back

Then the yelling stops A few seconds later Applegate

drags the guy back into the house trampling the pizza

He throws him to the floor bleeding unconscious maybe
dead either way not moving He runs out the front door

again

Just the still house now Pizza Guy on the floor back
door open Silence

Then the image goes black

MARTIN

STEINER (0S)
I’m just--

Martin pops to his feet and waves Steiner away angrily
MARTIN

I said get out of here Get that
goddamn thing out of my face already

He pushes Steiner aside The image swishes around the
room showing the faces of Aimes and Lorento all
unnerved by Martin’s outburst

RAINS (V0)
Take it easy Ben

MARTIN (VO)
Take it fucking easy Who’s the kid

RAINS (VO)
Ben Ben Tell her what

The camera turns off Blackness

INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

The camera comes back on at an odd angle as if it is
resting on the couch

RAINS (0S)
with us

Steiner lifts the camera onto Rains who watches Lorento
look around the back of the computer at a security cable
that chains it to the desk

LORENTO
Ill get some cutters

Rains nods Martin is at the door

MARTIN
I’1l meet you at the station

RAINS
Sounds good We’re just going to get
this thing out of here

He puts a comforting hand on Martin’s shoulder They
share a look and we know that Martin told him everything

Just as Martin turns we hear Stacy’s voice

STACY (VO)
Please help me Please

They all look back at the computer Steiner swings the
camera that way

It’s a close up of Stacy looking right at the camera
full frame crying sniffling

(This is the shot of her we saw at the very beginning of
the “movie” when Applegate first appeared on the video)

RAINS
You said it was done

LORENTO
It was

STACY

(on monitor)
He’s going to kill me I know he’s
going to

RAINS
Rewind it

She presses the buttons Nothing happens

RAINS (CONTD)
Well

LORENTO
This isn’t on the drive It’s live
It’s a live feed

STACY
(continuing on monitor)
-kill me He already Oh God
don’t let this happen He killed my
husband He killed them all Please
help me

She goes on like that Martin and Rains look at each other

RAINS
Live How can it be

Martin dives down under the editing table

MARTIN
Gimme a light

Lorento hands him a flashlight from her utility belt He
looks behind the computer and finds a cable feeding into
it He detaches it Stacy’s pleas cut out mid-sentence

He follows the cable to the wall

MARTIN (CONTD)
Screwdriver

Steiner hands a multi-tool into frame Lorento hands it
down to Martin who props open the screwdriver and removes
the switch-plate from the wall exposing the cable
inside

MARTIN (CONTD)
It goes down

He pops out from under the desk and runs from the room
Rains on his heels The camera bounces out after them
then the “low battery” light flashes on screen again

STEINER
Oh gimme a fucking brea--

It goes black

EXT SIDE YARD - NIGHT 81

They’ve pulled a grate off the crawl space that goes
beneath the house Martin is already underneath looking
back at the camera

MARTIN
Come on you’re coming with me

STEINER (VO)
Seriously All right um

He hands the camera to Lorento She films him bending
down face nervous as he looks into the darkness below
Head in Hips Feet

The camera POV leans in swishes as the camera gets
handed off to Steiner BENEATH THE HOUSE (CONTINUOUS)

INT BENEATH THE HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 82

It steadies on Martin laying on his stomach in the soft
dirt with less than a foot of headroom He’s looking
around spots something about fifteen feet away that gets
his attention He crawls toward it Steiner crawls after
him the camera bouncing

Martin finds a box top open A cable runs down to it
from a hole in the boards above He pulls out a video
camera

It’s still playing He pops open the little screen and
sees Stacy in the extreme close up Not talking now Eyes
down Wiping tears

APPLEGATE (VO)
(on the tape)
What’s your middle name

STACY
Margaret

APPLEGATE (VO)
That’s pretty What’s your favorite
color

Martin snaps the viewing screen closed
MARTIN
Come on Let’s get out of here
INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lorento is connecting the video camera to the larger
monitor for playback

RAINS
It could’ve been there the whole
time

MARTIN

Battery’s full He had to be down
there to press play ten minutes ago
Who the hell’s watching the outside
of this place

ON THE MONITOR
The playback comes on Stacy’s face in close-up

STACY
Yellow

APPLEGATE (VO)
Yellow’s pretty Why yellow

STACY
Reminds me of the sun Sunshine

APPLEGATE (VO)
Reminds me of mustard

The camera swings around onto Applegate’s face

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Hello Detective Martin How do you
like the movie

(MORE )

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
I left some popcorn in the kitchen
somewhere Go make a batch This next
part’s great

The shot on the monitor cuts to a shot of the second
bedroom from above in a high corner looking down on the
detectives as they are watching the playback of the poker
game in the movie

Martin’s eyes snap up to the corner where he sees a small
motion detector for an alarm system He pulls the couch
over steps up and removes it There is a spy camera set
into the wall

MARTIN
Son of a bitch I told you he was
fucking with us

He pulls it out so the cable just hangs not pointing at
them anymore

RAINS (0S)
Ben

Martin turns and looks down His expression changes
dramatically

Steiner’s shot follows Martin as he steps down from the
couch and looks at the monitor again

ON THE MONITOR

It is a shot of the living room but not from the corner
as we’d seen before from straight on at the couch It
shows Rains and Martin delivering lines we only heard off
camera earlier

RAINS (CONTD)
Take it easy Ben

MARTIN
Take if fucking easy Who’s the kid
think he is

RAINS
Ben Ben Tell her what

On the playback Martin sits Rains sits next to him A
pause as Martin collects himself

RAINS (CONTD)
Tell her what Ben

Go to full screen

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 84

RAINS
Look I’m not the lieutenant now I’m
just Joe I’m your friend I’m your
partner What’s going on

Martin takes a deep sigh

MARTIN
I know Gina’s dead

RAINS
No come on that was stupid what I
said before There’s no reason to
think--

MARTIN
She’s dead I got the call two weeks
ago She got hit by a bus A bus I
woulda jumped in front of that bus
In a hot fucking second I woulda
jumped in front of that bus For my
kid For Gina

He starts to cry Deep painful sobs Rains puts a hand
on his back

MARTIN (CONT’D)
How am I going to tell her mother
Oh God how’m I going to tell her
mother

He sobs for a long time then finally catches his breath
in slow gasps

RAINS
You all right Need some water

Martin shakes his head wipes his eyes on his sleeve

MARTIN
Why

RAINS
No reason Why this

He means the house the case they’re on
RAINS (CONTD)

No reason Life and death It is what
it is Doesn’t add up to anything
MARTIN
It’s got to Why do why do we do
what we do It’s got to mean
something

RAINS
It “means” sure We save someone
that means a lot Means a life But
there’s no score keeper No arbiter
of success or failure We save some
We lose some Some people live to a
hundred and ten and some get hit by a
bus Just sucks it had to be your
daughter

MARTIN
Yeah Yeah it does

He snorts up snot Exhales

MARTIN (CONT’D)
I’m gonna save this one Joe

RAINS
That’s the goal

MARTIN
No I mean it Whatever it takes
This girl Stacy the Newlywed she
gets the life my Gina didn’t get I
swear it to you to God to everyone
This girl lives

Rains just nods slowly

RAINS
Let’s get some coffee

Martin nods They stand and exit frame

The shot fades to black

INT SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

MARTIN
He’s been watching us the whole time

RAINS
(to Lorento)
That it

LORENTO
(reaching for the machine)
I don’t--

Then the image returns Applegate holds the camera on his
own face in what looks like the same shot he first
appeared in when he gave the speech to Martin

APPLEGATE
That was awesome Wow Really

He claps his free hand against the camera hand shaking
the image

APPLEGATE (CONT’D)
Well walk the aisle together man
I’m talking Oscar I mean I thought
I had talent in my movie the kids
were great Sam was the perfect
villain but you Detective yes
yes That’s what I was hoping for
The heart The real emotion You made
my movie and I thank you for that
really Most people talk about such
meaningless drivel Parking spots and
wedding cakes Gawd it’s torture
They’ve got more gas coming out of
their mouths than I do coming out of
my ass It’s so refreshing to hear
someone talk about real life To show
real feelings Thank you You have
inspired me Detective so much so
that I’m going to give you an
opportunity I’m going to give you
the chance to jump in front of the
bus that is roaring down on this
young lady

He moves next to Stacy again so they are both in frame
She is bound and gagged Seated on the floor Terrified

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Say hi honey it’s your close up

She tries to scream “Help me” through the gag tries to
struggle against the ties Then Applegate moves away from
her and puts the camera back on himself

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
Here’s what I’m going to do If you
go back into the living room and
stand in front of the couch where I
can see you put a gun into your
mouth and blow your brains out I’1l
set her free and surrender I’11
surrender peaceably or if you like
I’1l throw a knife at you guys and
you can use that as an excuse to blow
me away Is that a deal or what She
goes free I get killed and you get
to be the hero to save her to give
your life for another just like you
say you wish you could have done for
your daughter You get to make
meaning out of a meaningless world
What’s it going to be

He spins the camera back around to show Stacy again She
sees something off screen and gets even more terrified

She scoots herself backward with difficulty until her
back is against the wall and she can go no further The
large kitchen knife used to kill Sheila reaches into
frame and strokes her cheek her throat The tip of the
blade cuts through the gag She starts pleading and
crying

STACY
Help me Oh God please please help
me Oh my God

She breaks down in tears The screen goes black

RAINS

That was fifteen minutes ago when we
were on the couch He’s can’t be that
far

(to Lorento)
Radio the helicopters to sweep the
neighborhood again And get uniforms
to start going door to --

Martin suddenly spins and rushes out of the room

RAINS (CONT’D)
Ben Ben

He runs out after him The camera follows Steiner
running the camera bouncing

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 86

The shot picks up Detective Martin kicking a coffee table
out of the way Officer Aimes has pulled a cable a few
inches out from the wall

OFFICER AIMES
I found the cam--

MARTIN
Put it on me

Standing in the middle of the living room he faces the
camera and draws his gun

RAINS
Ben stop

Martin puts the gun to his temple He’s frightened torn
but clearly wanting to do this

RAINS (CONTD)
Come on You think he’1ll do it He’s
not gonna let her go not gonna give
himself up

MARTIN
He’ll do it

RAINS
It’s bullshit

MARTIN
He needs this That’s what the whole
movie is What his whole life is A
search for meaning This is
meaningful to him He wants this He
needs this

RAINS
He’s gonna let you blow your brains
out then he’s gonna kill her and
disappear and he wins Ben Come on
think

MARTIN
And if I don’t If I set my gun down
now what he’s gonna do He’s gonna
kill her I can’t do that to her
Joe You want me to do that to her

Rains moves cautiously forward

RAINS
Whatever that guy does you’re not
doing anything to that girl It’s not
you Ben You’re trying to help her
but you can’t help her if you do

this You can’t Put down the gun
Come on you know you don’t want to
do this

Martin’s face tightens His hand shakes The finger
starts to squeeze trigger The hammer pulls back

RAINS (CONT’D)

Ben Ben don’t She could already
be dead for all we know Ben God
dammit

Martin screams in agony and frustration then aims the
gun forward at the wall and pulls the trigger several
times Officer Aimes practically craps his pants as the
bullet holes appear in the wall just inches from him

Martin’s yell lasts all the way through the shots then
tapers off into silence He snatches the camera cable
from Aimes’s hands and looks right into it

MARTIN
I’m going to find you and I’m going
to kill you You fuck You hear me
I’m going to kill you

He rips the cord from the wall Everyone stands stark and
still The tension slowly ebbs

RAINS
(exhaling)
Jesus

Rains walks out of the shot Martin just stands there
tense heavy Then he walks toward the back door

RAINS (VO) (CONT’D)
Where’re you going

MARTIN
Call Heather

As Martin exits through the back door the shot swings
back around to find Rains sitting in a chair

RAINS
Give it a rest

The camera turns off

EXT BACK YARD - NIGHT 87

It comes back on looking at the ground then swings up
catching sight of Martin under the light over the garage
He got the phone to his ear and has been crying

MARTIN
(from a distance)
Yeah baby I know I know

Officer Lorento enters frame from beside the camera

LORENTO
Detective I’m sorry Couple of
morgue guys are outside Want to know
if it’s okay to take the body

MARTIN
What body

LORENTO
The boy Chris Fowler

MARTIN
No I haven’t seen him yet
(into phone)
Heather Heath I’ve got to go
Ill come by later Okay Okay

He hangs up sniffling wiping his face He follows
Lorento back into the house The camera turns and goes in
behind them (CONTINUOUS) into the LIVING ROOM

Near the front door Martin sees two MORGUE ATTENDANTS
walking past Rains with a gurney

MARTIN (CONTD)
Hold up a sec

He pushes past them into the BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS)
Rains goes in with him the camera behind them

Martin kneels down door for a closer look at Chris in the
closet Beaten Dried blood on his face and on the floor

He looks at where Stacy ripped the bolts from the concrete
then up at the shelf where the camera used to be

MARTIN (CONTD)
Gimme some more light

Steiner moves in closer with the camera

It’s the first time we really get to see the inside of

the closet clearly There’s nothing else in here Just a
wood floor and bare walls The two side walls where the
captives were chained are concrete The back is drywall

Martin stands feeling up along the walls looking for
anything of note He finally tilts his head all the way
back to look at the ceiling He taps Steiner who tilts
the camera up

STEINER (VO)
Sorry

In the ceiling of the closet is a two foot square cut out
crawl hole that leads to the attic Martin looks around
for something to stand on but there’s nothing

MARTIN
There’s was a chair in the other
room

LORENTO (VO)
Ill get it

RAINS
God knows what’s up there

MARTIN
God and him They can take the kid

Rains nods off screen The two Morgue Employees enter
with the gurney which they lay down next to Chris’s
body They ease him on Martin looks at his pale face

MARTIN (CONT’D)
(distantly)
I was here

They carry him out Lorento has returned with the desk
chair The camera shuffles as it gets slid into the
closet It’s a swivel-type desk chair not very sturdy as
Martin steps on it and pushes at the crawl space cover

RAINS
Let us get you a ladder

Martin nearly falls steadies himself jumps to grab the
edges of the crawl space and pulls himself up

MARTIN
Gimme the flashlight

Lorento hands her flashlight up to him His other hand
takes out his pistol and he disappears

RAINS (VO)
Can you get up there

STEINER (VO)
Seriously

The camera swings onto Rains’ face

RAINS
Yes seriously what the fuck

STEINER (VO)
Yeah
(off Rains’ scowl)
I mean yes sir

Swish-shot as he hands the camera off to Lorento

It goes OFF

INT ATTIC - NIGHT 88

The camera comes back on searching around for Martin
The spotlight drifts off into darkness

STEINER (0S)
Detective Martin
(silence)
Detective Martin

The light finally settles on Det Martin about ten feet
away peering down at something He looks back at Steiner
and the camera whispering harshly

MARTIN
Turn if off

STEINER
What

MARTIN
The light Turn it off
(beat)
Do it

The light goes off first leaving us in near absolute
darkness just the hint of light coming through cracks
here and there We hear movement then Martin’s voice
much closer

MARTIN (CONTD)
Let’s go back You can turn it off

Full blackness

EXT FRONT YARD - NIGHT 89

It comes back on to find Martin and Rains standing in the
front yard Martin is finishing a rough sketch of the
layout of the house on a pad of paper A box walls
drawn for the living room dining room kitchen Two
bedrooms with the hallway connecting them and the
bathroom in the middle

Only between the bathroom and the bedroom is an empty
rectangle that Martin circles

MARTIN
I paced it out The bedroom closet
ends here the bathroom starts here
There’s about four feet in between
He’s in there I know he is

RAINS
Youre saying he’s in the house You
saw him

MARTIN

No But he’s there It makes sense
It’s his last stand

RAINS
With the girl

MARTIN
Safe bet

RAINS

So what do you want to do just smash
our way in I wish we could see him
in there

STEINER (VO)
We can

They both look at the camera curiously
STEINER (VO) (CONTD)
Weve got a couple of his remote
cameras We can hook one up to this
drill a hole in the wall

Martin looks at Rains for the go-ahead Gets a little nod

RAINS
But if he moves on the girl we pull
back And none of that “no due
process” cowboy shit you were spewing
earlier Now I’m the LT again A
clean bust you got it I don’t want
this one getting away

MARTIN
Neither do I

Rains grimaces They walk off Steiner tilts the camera
up for a shot of the moon After a beat

MARTIN (0S) (CONT’D)
Hey Marty Scorcese you coming

The shot jerks down from the moon to Martin on the porch

STEINER (VO)
Um yeah sorry

INT BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

Officer Aimes holds a drill up to the wall A pregnant
pause They all listen closely Then Martin nods at him
The drill starts It’s loud It grinds into the drywall

When the drill comes out it leaves a 12” hole looking
into darkness Martin holds a cautious hand up for
everyone to be quiet They listen Nothing

MARTIN
You in there Mr Applegate You hear
me

Martin nods at Aimes again He pokes one of the small spy
cams on a cable into the hole The image switches to the
POV of the spy cam in the closet Grayish dark

STEINER (VO)
It’s just dark There’s not enough
light to pick up any--

He stops when he gets a glimpse of a body Then the
camera tilts upward (as if Applegate himself grabbed the
cable and moved it up) until we are looking right at his
face in extreme close-up

APPLEGATE
Hello Detective

The shot switches back to the main camera image of Martin
and Rains leaning to the wall listening at the tiny hole

APPLEGATE (CONTD)
You disappointed me back there

MARTIN
Stacy Stacy can you hear me This is
the police You’re going to be all
right

Stacy’s muffled pleas rise then we hear a loud hit
followed by silence

APPLEGATE
I wasn’t bluffing If you’d killed
yourself I’d have let her go

MARTIN
There’s nowhere for you to go Bruce
No hiding any more

APPLEGATE
Go I don’t want to go anywhere This
is my home I was born here I’1l die
here So will you So will she

Stacy starts to scream again Loud Terrified More than
just fear Pain Martin pounds a fist into the wall
making a dent in the plasterboard

MARTIN
God dammit no

The screams are blood-curling Still muffled from the
gag Then it seems to fall away

STACY
Help me Help me oh god please
help Daddy

Martin pounds his fist into the wall over and over

MARTIN
Noshewon’t

He finally punches through The screams continue no more
words just pain Martin and Rains tear at the drywall
until Martin finally puts his whole body into it and
crashes through A cloud of drywall dust fills the air

We see Martin but not Applegate or Stacy both of whom
are still hidden by the remaining wall Then a large arm
darts into frame and yanks Martin back behind the wall

Gone We hear the struggle See the wall shake The
camera pushes forward into the closet

We see Martin’s face with Applegate’s arm wrapped around
his neck like a vice and the other hand holding a gun to
his head Applegate has Stacy pressed back behind him
completely trapped against the wall

MARTIN (CONTD)
Turn the camera off

APPLEGATE
No This is my ending This is why
youre here

MARTIN
God dammit Steiner turn the fucking
camera off

APPLEGATE
I’1l kill her

STEINER (VO)
What do I do

APPLEGATE
Keep filming

MARTIN
Turn it off

Martin struggles to raise his own pistol but can’t get
it high enough to get a shot behind him at Applegate

STEINER (VO)
What do I do

RAINS (VO)
Ben

MARTIN
Don’t give him the satisfaction

RAINS (V0)
Turn it off

APPLEGATE
No I need my ending

Applegate takes the gun away from Martin’s head and
presses it to Stacy’s head She screams

MARTIN
Here’s your ending

Martin presses his pistol to his own chest over his
lung and pulls the trigger BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG

Five times

The camera jitters as Steiner is startled from the gun
shots It settles on Ben Martin’s face still alive but
in shock and pain Martin slides down revealing Applegate
behind him his chest also a bloody mess on his Polo-
style shirt

He tumbles down over Martin landing at Steiner’s feet

Stacy is seated against the wall behind Martin She’s
screaming

Rains wants to get in the closet but there’s no room

RAINS (VO)
Ben Ben

MARTIN
(to Stacy)
Shhh Shhh now Okay

She quiets down He looks at Steiner’s camera lens

MARTIN (CONTD)
Is he dead

STEINER (VO)
What

MARTIN
Is he dead

The camera moves from Martin’s face onto Applegate’s back

STEINER
I don’t I can’t tell Wait

A tiny breath

STEINER (VO) (CONTD)
No He’s still alive

Another gun shot Applegate’s body bounces right at
Steiner’s feet No more breathing

STEINER (VO) (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ

RAINS (VO)
Get the hell--

He shoves Steiner back and enters frame climbing over
Applegate and leaning in to Martin

RAINS (CONT’D)
Ben

He sees he’s alive but in bad shape Then he sees Stacy
behind him unharmed terrified relieved overwhelmed

STACY
Oh God Oh God

RAINS

She nods in tears Officer Lorento reaches in helping
Stacy to climb over Martin and Applegate and leading her
out into the living room The camera swings over to follow
them for a moment then swigs back onto Martin and Rains

MARTIN
She made it She lives
RAINS
Yeah Ben she made it
MARTIN
It means something Joe It means
something
RAINS

Yeah buddy It means something

Martin’s eyes flutter closed and he dies A long beat
Rains stands Steiner steps back to show Rains standing
over the bodies of Martin and Applegate

RAINS (CONT’D)
I wish I knew what

He walks out of the room The camera follows him into the
LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) Rains stops to see Stacy
kneeling near the fireplace Lorento is holding onto her
shoulders trying to ease her away Stacy comes up with
the gold chain and dolphin pendant She clutches them in
her hand as Lorento leads her outside where her father
waiting on the lawn pushes past two uniformed officers
and pulls her into his arms

RAINS (VO) (CONT’D)
You can turn that off now
