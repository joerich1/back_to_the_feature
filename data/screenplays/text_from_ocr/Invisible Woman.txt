EXT BEACH MARGATE KENT DAY 1885

The STEADY FOOTFALL OF A WOMAN’s BOOTS sinking in wet
sand-

The RISE and FALL of a WOMAN’s breath-

MRS GEORGE WHARTON ROBINSON aka ‘NELLY’ head down consumed
by thought etching a line across the sand like charcoal
on paper until-

NELLY stops looking out at the endless grey Margate
coastline beyond eyes dark and lost in some deep troubled
distraction a sense she has walked as far as the landscape
will let her-

Heart beating chest rising she stands until-

She turns head down once more walking as she picks up
her pace-

The swoop and call of gulls skimming the pier
overhead

INT SCHOOL HALL SCHOOLHOUSE MARGATE DAY 1885

A school hall-

On a raised stage a YOUNG SCHOOL BOY in fake
moustache dressed as a waiter stands in waiting Two
more SCHOOLBOYS dressed in climbing costumes sit at
a cafe table close by A back cloth of the Swiss Alps
strung up behind A young male teacher MR LAMBOURNE
late 20’s hovers distracted clearly trying to
organise an errant backstage

In the wings just visible PROP MAKERS and STAGE MANAGERS
adjust collars on SCHOOLBOY ACTORS An angelic LION 6 yrs
waits with OTHERS bored and tired in floormop wig and
painted nose yawning as he peeks out to the auditorium
beyond to see-

REVEREND WILLIAM BENHAM mid 50’s sits silently waiting
in the makeshift stalls reading through a playscript
entitled-

No Thoroughfare A Drama in Five Acts by Charles Dickens
and Wilkie Collins

Beyond a small orchestra of SCHOOLBOYS just visible ina
makeshift orchestra pit a JOLLY SCHOOLBOY PERCUSSIONIST
tightens a nut on a wide drum A TEENAGE VIOLINIST waxes
the strings on a viola a SCHOOLBOY OBOIST and PIANIST
quietly tune up looking to the clock overhead

The SENSE OF TIME TICKING ON-

DISTANT MURMUR OF VOICES PASSING-—

MR GEORGE WHARTONearly 30s headmaster clergyman and

distant corridor

GEORGE
Here is the theatre The boys
always perform a short play at the
end of term highly popular with
the parents Theatre is an abiding
interest of my wife’s Which of
course I delight in

He smiles at BENHAM a shared look of quizzical concern
clock ticking overhead

GEORGE (CONTD)
Is she still not here

BENHAM shrugs smiles benignly

GEORGE (CONTD)

Mr and Mrs Featherstone may I
introduce Mr Benham Mr Benham is
invaluable to the school He
assists my wife with penny readings
and other charitable events You
will often find them in corners
plotting their next money raising
venture

The CAST ORCHESTRA and BENHAM wait on-

next to BENHAM

BENHAM

confident that Mr Dickens would
have let it pass-
NELLY deflects with a smile

NELLY (CONT’D)

NELLY nods to an OLD STAGE MANAGER

The OLD STAGE MANAGER nods hurrying to drop a scenery cloth
revealing a mountain landscape

INT SCHOOLHALL MARGATE DAY 1885 7

NELLY seemingly lost in watching the play oblivious to
BENHAM’s brief gaze quietly observant noting little to
give away her state of distraction bar the steam of her wet
boots and the sense that her mind is always elsewhere-

SCHOOL BOY 3
Fair weather or foul I have no
time to lose And I am for
pushing on-

But still BENHAM clocks it looking back resuming watching-
The SCHOOL BOY MOUTAINEERS climbing a mountainous pile of
plaster and cardboard Alp The endless icy landscape beyond
and SWIRL of the PERCUSSIVE STORM DEAFENING IN THE

A YOUNG PERCUSSIONIST SWILLS peas in a tin tray creating the
noise of falling rain It builds and builds-

NELLY walks forward a little clutching a few pages of
script

NELLY
This is a tale of woe This
is a tale of sorrow A love
denied A love restored to
live beyond tomorrow Lest
we think silence is the
place to hide a heavy heart
remember to love and be
loved is life itself
Without which we are nought

touching DICKENS momentarily lost until-

MRS TERNAN

heartbreak

NELLY (CONTD)
Until now I thought Bleak House was
the novel that would stay with me
the most It has this alarming
spirit of unease Lady Deadlock
haunted by her pastI am drawn
back to those pages again and
again And yet there is so much
that also makes me smile

CATHERINE
It is a fiction designed to
entertain

NELLY
Nonosurely it’s more than that
It makes us think It changes us
CATHERINE considers NELLY with thoughtful gaze then looks
back at DICKENS a sudden heavy sadness overwhelming her
which she deflects witha smile-

He will be up all night and
cross all day

upon that every human creature

is still with us

NELLY suddenly stands the scrape of her chair sudden and
surprising blowing out a candle on a table

chapters of his novels I am sure
Mrs Wharton Robinson would not
mind if you cared to borrow-

NELLY
Of course Of course

My wife has nearly every edition
We have run out of shelves

MARY enters with more refreshment-

Ah good Thank you Mary

They nod their thanks in passing GEORGE once more drawing
the GOVERNOR and his WIFE into conversation BENHAM reaches
for a copy of the Frozen Deep playtext-

NELLY turns suddenly on edge BENHAM’s eyes already grazing
over several notes made in some folded pages slipped between
the pages of the playtext On these papers the lines are
scored through the sense of this as a once worked text And
just visible pressed in the folds of the these pages-

A tiny lock of hair

NELLY
Yes It is not a good play

NELLY with gentle precision takes the playtext out of
BENHAM’s hands snapping it shut and sliding it once more

clinging to it -when a green vast
hillside of water moving on
shoreward from beyond the ship he
seemed to leap up into it with a
mighty bound and the ship was gone

exhilarated as if she has been in the very same storm

aware of his gaze travelling over the garish and rather
threadbare fixtures and fittings-

DICKENS
Thank you This is warm and
charming-

LATER-

DICKENS talking to a tired and lazy audience on the edge of

MARIA
And then what did you say

DICKENS
What I should have said was “Mr
Anderson though your Ugly Duckling
has delighted you have slept in
this room for five weeks now You
must go home “

FANNY
But you did not

DICKENS
I did not

NELLY
Why didn’t you

DICKENS
It would have broken his heart So
instead I inscribed a volume of my
latest work From his friend and
admirer Charles Dickens Though I
should have addedMay you never
outstay your welcome so long
again”

DICKENS keeps walking passing an almost hellish world of

By ‘those’ he meant the many fallen
women that we see around us every
day and their offspring many who
rely on this hospital today I
replied

That is a silly question He
is Mr Charles DickensEven
in those early years
together even I could not
fail to be impressed But
you will find you must
share him with his public
They will be the constant
and in truth you will never
absolutely know which one he
loves the most You or them
I do not believe he knows
himself But they will not
give him up of that you can

doorways slowly dimming to darkness as shutters are closed
by a MAID DICKENS packs the last of his things close by

DICKENS
Have you left the keys on the
table

NELLY absently nods

Only I promised Monsieur
DuboitThere is a very nice
family from Rouen who wish to
winter here

DICKENS passes her

DICKENS (CONTD)
Say something
(silence)
SAY SOMETHING

NELLY silent until-

She caves her body suddenly overwhelmed with grief DICKENS
looking on unable to help her wanting to but stricken by
the overwhelming pain and grief that he sees Her sobs
audible fighting her way out of this agony Her tears at
last subsiding she slowly gathers herself

NELLY

hands briefly touch NELLY nearly misses her footing NELLY
quietly reassuring DICKENS following her on the train-
A TICKET COLLECTOR punches their tickets-
TICKET COLLECTOR

Rokesmith and be done

DICKENS smiles clutching a sheaf of papers blotted with
familiar scrawl title Our Mutual Friend just visible

DICKENS
Perhaps the next chapter

The squawk of gulls overhead

INT CARRIAGE TRAIN NEAR STAPLEHURST KENT DAY 1865 91

The TEARING STEADY RHYTHM OF TRAIN WHEELS AGAINST STEEL AND
TRACK-—

The STREAK of countryside FLEETING and ABSTRACTED a BLUR of

Then just visible in the glass NELLY’s reflection indistinct
yet rippling in the glass-

Blue Revisions dated 11th June 2012 95

PULL OUT TO REVEAL NELLY quietly absent face pale staring
out of the train and seated opposite her-

PULL OUT TO AT LAST TO REVEAL THE SHADOWY FIGURE CAUGHT THE
GLASS AS DICKENS lost in correcting papers blotted with
familiar scrawl the title Our Mutual Friend just visible

A distant GUFFAW from the neighbouring compartment
DICKENS looks over at NELLY-

DICKENS
Sleep and when you wake we shall
be home

NELLY catches on this she looks at him Then closes her

eyes trying to sleep grief ever present the ruby
bracelet on her wrist

INT CARRIAGE TRAIN NEAR STAPLEHURST KENT DAY 1865 93

The TEARING STEADY RHYTHM OF TRAIN WHEELS AGAINST STEEL AND
TRACK-—

The SCRATCH SCRATCH of his pen against paper

CLOSE UP ON NELLY looking out of the window trying to sleep
eyes catching on the fleeting landscape

DICKENS lost in total concentration-
Suddenly the train violently jolts-

The scream of PASSENGERS and screech of metal as carriages
visibly buckle-

The smash of glass hands reaching out NELLY at once
WHIPPED out of her seat arms thrown forward in useless
protection FLUNG through a split carriage and HURLED
through splinters of glass a world upturned-

DICKENS OOV

(shouting out)
Nelly-

EXT GRASSY BANK NEAR TRACK STAPLEHURST DAY 1865 94

NELLY eyes flickering open her body twisted her arm at an
odd angle perhaps broken-

Around the scatter of luggage a trunk split open silk
undergarments caught on a rowan bush
Blue Revisions dated 11th June 2012 96

NELLY’s POV of the buckled wreckage of the train DICKENS
clambering out of a severed carriage scrabbling down the
grassy bank towards her

Around him the TWIST OF WRECKAGE BODIES LITTERED the
GROANS OF THE WOUNDED SMASHED UP SEATING LUGGAGE HURLED
ACROSS THICK GRASS AND BRAMBLES CHAOS ALL AROUND

PORTER
Sir-

Beyond the screams and shouts of the injured a PORTER
dazed but in charge moving amongst them

PORTER (CONTD)

We are asking everyone able
bodied if they could help with
the most injured

DICKENS
Yes of course I must help Water
People will need water

PORTER
(beat)
Is it Mr Dickens Sir

DICKENS hesitates nods looking to NELLY concerned not
wanting to leave her-

DICKENS
Yes

PORTER
Were you travelling alone Sir

NELLY’s eyes catching on DICKENS willing him to turn away

NELLY
(hushedexhaled)
Gogo

NELLY’s heart beat thumping in her head until-

DICKENS OOV
YesYes Quite alone This young
lady is in need of assistance

DICKENS turns with a look of absolute despair as he walks
away as he turns his head away from view

PORTER
We are dealing with the most
injured first

NELLY’s vision fades the blurry figure of DICKENS walking
away

Blue Revisions dated 11th June 2012 97

DICKENS OOV
I’1l do what I can

NELLY’s hands clasp the PORTER not wanting to let him go
slipping in and out of consciousness

PORTER
Madam I will get one of the
ladies to attend to you as soon
as

The PORTER nods to two YOUNG LADIES on the approach

PORTER (CONTD)
(moving off)
This way Sir

The two YOUNG LADIES pass coming quickly to NELLY’s aid
with DICKENS seen following the PORTER

YOUNG LADIES
You poor dear

Beyond the young TICKET COLLECTOR wide eyed and dead
thrown across the twisted track NELLY with the two YOUNG
LADIES comforting her

YOUNG LADIES (CONTD)
We are hereWe are here

DICKENS moving amongst the dead the dying and the wounded
offering brandy

A page of Our Mutual Friend caught in the grass of the

embankment DICKENS flattens it out splattered with ink
and blood pocketing it before moving on-

INT SCHOOLHALL MARGATE DUSK 1885 95

A thin pamphlet programme No Thoroughfare A Drama in Five
Acts by Mr Wilkie Collins placed down on a chair by a
SCHOOLBOY methodically moving a long a row of seats The rows
of chairs being laid out by two SCHOOLBOYS beyond-

The back of the hall a MAID hurries to finish last minute

table laid out with a magnificent buffet-—

The first PARENTS arriving led by MARY GEORGE coming forward
to greet them offering brief exchange gesturing towards a
table

EXT CHURCH MARGATE 1885 DUSK 96

NELLY walking fast A small church ahead of her We might
sense the sea Spiky winter trees her breathing as she
walks

EXT CHURCH MARGATE 1885 DUSK 97

NELLY enters a small graveyard She is a lone figure
standing amongst the gravestones

BENHAM (0S)
Ellen Ternan

NELLY turns surprised BENHAM standing near the entrance of
the church caught in the half light His face slightly
shadowed by a hat

NELLY
(nods)
Yes That was my name You have
always known this

BENHAM
Suspected Things you said
comments memories of Mr Dickens
that were not a child’s memories

NELLY stands distracted BENHAM sensing she needs something
from him BENHAM gestures to a bench to one side of the small
cemetery

BENHAM (CONTD)
I saw him read once It was
magical Row upon row craning
forward marvelling at this
transformation One forgets that he
was more than writer more than
actor He would pull you soaring
spinning into the heart of another
world

BENHAM smiles betraying his utter admiration
BENHAM (CONTD)
I have lived my life in the pages
of those novels
BENHAM smiles suddenly moved
BENHAM (CONTD)
I should not have expected their

author to live so quiet a life

BENHAM quietly considers NELLY
Blue Revisions dated 11th June 2012 99

BENHAM (CONTD)
You inspired him

NELLY

Perhaps I don’t know I would say
Maybe we inspired each other It
was not easy our friendship Never
quite knowing when one would see
him when or even if he would
arrive It was often fragile -And
yet there were days of such
joysuch celebrationWhen we
would talklaugh together But
there were moments towards the end
when I dreaded his visitsperhaps
even his touch But we needed each
other In our secret life I was
his magic circle of one

(beat)
There was a day when he took me to
the house where I was to live

She gets lost in her thought

BENHAM
Mrs Wharton Robinson-

NELLY trying to make sense of it searching for words

NELLY
I have thought about it often The
moment when I finally accepted what
our life was to be
(beat)
He knew he would leave me first
That he would die first

NELLY lost deep within herself

NELLY (CONT’D)

Charles understood that however
painful it is we are alone
Whoever we are with we are alone
And he was right Great
Expectations He wrote an ending -
It was his first instinctive
ending A good ending the best
ending- Pip and Estella do not come
together Pip sees that she will
never be his Later they wanted him
to change it Some people thought
it too brutal So instead Pip
finals words are - “I saw the
shadow of no parting from her” - He
ends the book in shadows you see
a place of uncertainty of
haunting And that is where I have
been living Do you see-

NELLY stares out at the castle floating far off across the

Everyone has their secret And
this is ours

DICKENS
Yes

NELLY reaches over to him awkwardly her arm giving her
discomfort She kisses him gently on the forehead - almost as
if he were a boy

NELLY
So much more complicated than
anything one could write ina

Yet he seems aged and frail vulnerable depleted leaning
into NELLY
