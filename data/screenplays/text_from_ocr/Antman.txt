1989 — Hank Pym enters a SHIELD facility

Dr Hank Pym Stark

Mitchell Carson He doesn’t seem happy

Howard Stark Hello Hank You’re supposed to be in Moscow

Dr Hank Pym I took a detour he places a vial containing a red serum on the table Through
your defense lab

Peggy Carter Tell me that isn’t what I think it is

Dr Hank Pym It depends if you think it’s a poor attempt to replicate my work Even for this
group that takes nerve

Mitchell Carson You were instructed to go to Russia May I remind you Dr Pym that you’re a
soldier

Dr Hank Pym I’m a scientist

Howard Stark Then act like one The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever
developed help us put it to good use

Dr Hank Pym I let you turn me into your errand boy and now you try to steal my research
Mitchell Carson If only you’d protected Janet with such ferocity Dr Pym

Dr Hank Pym Oh god suddenly Pym slams down Carson’s face on the table in anger Peggy
pulls him away

Peggy Carter Easy Hank

Dr Hank Pym You mention my wife again and I’ll show you ferocity Carson looks at Stark
as he wipes blood from his nose

Howard Stark Don’t look at me you said it

Dr Hank Pym I formally tender my resignation

Howard Stark We don’t accept it Formally Hank we need you The Pym Particle is a miracle
Please don’t let your past determine the future

Dr Hank Pym As long as I am alive nobody will ever get that formula Pym turns and leaves
Mitchell Carson We shouldn’t let him leave the building

Peggy Carter You’ve already lied to him now you want to go to war with him

Mitchell Carson Yes Our scientists haven’t come close to replicating his work

Howard Stark He just kicked your ass full size You really want to find out what it’s like when
you can’t see him coming I’ve known Hank Pym for a long time he’s no security risk Unless
we make him one

Pym drives up to Pym Technologies

e Pym Tech Gate Guard Dr Pym

e Dr Hank Pym Yes I’m still alive

e — the guard smiles and lets Pym drive through the gate Pym then enters the building

e Pym Tech Security Guard 1D

e Dr Hank Pym referring to the massive painting of Pym in his younger days hanging
behind the guard Perhaps that will suffice

e Pym Tech Security Guard I’m very sorry sir Please come in

e Pym Tech Employee Is that Hank Pym

e¢ Hope van Dyne Good morning Hank

e Dr Hank Pym Hope Would it kill you to call me dad

e Hope van Dyne Well Dr Cross will be so please that you could find the time to join us
today

e Darren Cross More like thrilled

e Cross walks over to Pym and shakes his hand

e Dr Hank Pym I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you Darren

What’s the occasion

e Darren Cross Oh you’ll see Won’t he Hope

e Hope gives Pym a cold look

e¢ Hope van Dyne We’re ready for you inside

e Hope walks away

e Darren Cross Ouch referring to Hope I guess some old wounds never heal huh

Don’t worry she’s in good hands You’re in for a treat

e Carson comes over to Pym as they are about to enter the lab

e Carson Long time no see Dr Pym How’s retirement they shake hands

e Dr Hank Pym How’s your face

e Carson enters the lab

e Hope van Dyne After you

Pym enters the lab

Darren Cross Now before we start I’d like to introduce a very special guest this
company’s founder and my mentor Dr Hank Pym everyone in the lab claps at the
same time Pym notices the miniature building of Pym Technologies has now got the logo
Cross Technologies on it When I took over this company for Dr Pym I immediately
started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while
increasing density and strength Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the
dust and cobwebs of Hank’s research I couldn’t tell you But just imagine A soldier the
size of an insect The ultimate secret weapon he shows everyone footage reel of soldiers
getting killed but with a tiny costumed figure also every footage An “Ant-Man”
pointing to Pym That’s what they called you Right Hank Silly I know Propaganda
Tales to astonish Trumped up BS to scare the USSR Hank will you tell our guests
what you told me every single time I asked you was the Ant-Man real

Dr Hank Pym Just a tall tale

Darren Cross Right Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real
Cross leads everyone into another room Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-
Man And with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material I thought could it be
possible to shrink a person Could that be done Well it’s not a legend anymore
Distinguished guests I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it the
Yellowjacket he shows them a yellow insect sized suit The Yellowjacket is an all-
purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat
advantage he puts on a video

Video Voice Over We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves
are undermined by constant surveillance It’s time to return to a simpler age One where
the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests An all-
purpose peace-keeping vessel The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the Geo-
political landscape completely unseen Efficient in both preventative measures and
tactical assault Practical applications include surveillance industrial sabotage and the
elimination of obstructions on the road to peace A single Yellowjacket offers the user
unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon an army of
Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world The
Yellowjacket

Frank So it’s a suit

Darren Cross Don’t be crude Frank It’s not a suit it’s a it’s a vessel What’s a
matter you’re not impressed

Frank Oh I’m impressed I’m also concerned Imagine what our enemies could do with
this tech

Darren Cross We should have a longer conversation about that Frank I really value
your opinion Thank you for coming Hope

Hope van Dyne Thank you very much everybody I will escort you out now Thank
you

Darren Cross You seem a bit shocked

as everyone leaves the room Pym walks over to Cross

Dr Hank Pym Darren there’s a reason that I buried these secrets

Darren Cross So you finally admit it We could’ve done this together Hank But you
ruined that That’s why you’re the past and I’m the future
e Dr Hank Pym Don’t do this

e Mitchell Carson Dr Cross Cross goes over to Carson You sell to me first twenty
percent of your asking price I can have the cash here in two weeks

e Darren Cross Deal

e Hope van Dyne after everyone leaves Cross’ presentation Hope goes over to Pym We
have to make our move Hank

e Dr Hank Pym How close is he

e¢ Hope van Dyne He still can’t shrink a live subject Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all

e Dr Hank Pym No

e¢ Hope van Dyne have Cross’ complete trust

e Dr Hank Pym It’s too dangerous

e Hope van Dyne We don’t have a choice

e Dr Hank Pym Well that’s not entirely true

e Hope van Dyne think I found a guy

e Dr Hank Pym Who

e Hideous Rabbit You’re my bestest friend

e Scott Lang No wait it’s my daughter’s birthday

e Paxton It’s my house

e Scott Lang So what it’s my kid

e Maggie walks over to them

e Maggie Lang Scott You can’t just show up here you know that Come on

e Paxton Hey watch your language Okay

e Scott Lang Oh what language I said hat

e Maggie takes Scott out of the house

e Scott Lang Really Maggie That guy Come on you could marry anyone you want

e Scott gets into Luis’s van Cassie waves goodbye to him as he drives off honking the
musical horn

Frank is in the bathroom taking a leak

e Darren Cross I’m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket Frank

e Frank turns back in surprise to find Cross standing there watching him

e Frank Yeah well uh unfortunately we can’t just do whatever we want Would be nice
though right

e he chuckles as he washes his hands

e Frank But there are laws

e Darren Cross What laws Of man The laws of nature transcend the laws of man and
I’ve transcended the laws of nature

e Frank Darren I don’t think you understand

e suddenly Cross uses a small device on Frank which vaporizes him into a blob of goo

e Darren Cross Hm We still haven’t worked out all the bugs

e Cross uses a tissue to wipe the goo off the sink and dumps it into one of the toilets

e Darren Cross Goodbye Frank

e he flushes the toilet and washes his hands
Cross and Hope are having dinner at a restaurant

Darren Cross You know I’ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately and today
during my morning meditation an interesting thought occurred to me and I think it might
apply to you too

Hope van Dyne How’s that

Darren Cross Gratitude can be forgiveness I spent years carrying around my anger for
Hank Pym I devoted my genius to him I could’ve worked anywhere I chose my mentor
poorly You didn’t even have a choice He never believed in you It’s a shame what we
had to do but he forced us to do it didn’t he But we shouldn’t be angry we should be
grateful Because his failures as a mentor as a father forced us to spread our wings
Hope van Dyne Youre a success Darren You deserve everything coming your way

after sitting outside in the van trying to figure how many days he’s got left to see Cassie again
Scott returns to Luis’s apartment

Luis Hey what’s up hotshot

Scott doesn’t reply

Dave Maybe he didn’t hear you

Luis How was the party

Scott goes to the fridge takes out a beer bottle and takes a swig from it

Scott Lang Tell me about that tip

Luis What

Scott Lang I want to know about that tip

Luis Ooh baby it’s on

Dave Hot dog

Luis It’s so on right now

Dave Look who grew a pair

Scott Lang Calm down alright I just need to know where it came from it’s gotta be
airtight
Luis Okay I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto which was mainly reds and
you know I don’t love reds man you know But there was a rosé that saved the day it
was delightful And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with it was
actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched
Scott Lang It’s the wrong details It’s wrong It has nothing to do with the story Go
Luis So uh he tells me that she’s working as a housekeeper now right And she’s
dating this dude Carlos who’s a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about
the dude that she’s cleaning for Right That he’s like this big-shot CEO that is all
retired now but he’s loaded And so Carlos and Emesto are on the same softball team
and they get to talking right And here comes the good part Carlos says “Yo man This
guy’s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement just chillin’”” Of course Ernesto
comes to me cause he knows I’ve got mad thieving skills Of course I ask him “Did
Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was And he says “Nah
dog All she said is that it’s like super legit and whatever’s in it has gotta be good
Scott Lang What

Kurt Old man have safe

e Luis And he’s gone for a week

e Scott Lang Alright There’s an old man he’s got a safe and he’s gone for a week Let’s
just work with that

e Luis Y’know what I’m sayin’

we see the group getting prepared and gathering the right gear for the robbery

e Kurt Landlines cut cell signals jammed No one will be making for distress call tonight

e Luis All check

e Kurt Check

e Dave Check

e Luis If the job goes bad you know I got your back right

e Scott Lang Don’t worry it’s not gonna happen Scott leaves the van

e Luis I love it when he gets cocky as they guys stay in the van they watch Scott hop the
fence into the house

e Dave Damn through his earpiece Alarm is dead

e Luis Nice

e Scott Lang Alright I’m moving through the house

e inside the house Scott finds a door with a thumbprint scanner

e Scott Lang There’s a fingerprint lock on the door

e Luis It’s got a what Ernesto didn’t tell me nothin’ about that Aw man are we
screwed

e Scott Lang Not necessarily

e Scott quickly uses several household items to get a fingerprint from a door knob and
uses that to successfully pass the thumbprint scanner

e Scott Lang I’m in

e Kurt No alarms have been triggered He’s in like the Flynn

e Scott opens the door and immediately sees the safe made of strong metal

e Scott Lang Oh man

e Luis What is it

e Scott Lang Well they weren’t kidding this safe is serious

e Luis How serious we talkin’ Scotty

e Scott Lang It’s a Carbondale It’s from 1910 made from the same steel as the Titanic

e Luis Wow Can you crack it

e Scott Lang Well here’s the thing It doesn’t do so well in the cold Remember what that
iceberg did

e Luis Yeah man it killed DiCaprio

e Dave It killed everybody

e Kurt But not the old lady She still threw the jewel into the oceans

e Scott gets to work to try and open the safe

e Luis What are you doing

e Scott Lang I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen Ice
expands metal doesn’t

e Luis What are you doing now

e Scott Lang Waiting Waiting

e the safe door breaks open
Scott Nice

Scott looks inside the safe

Luis What is it cash Jewels

Scott Lang Well there’s nothing here

Luis What’d you say

Scott notices some blueprints and the original Ant-Man suit
Scott Lang It’s a suit

Luis What

Scott Lang It’s an old motorcycle suit

Luis There’s no cash no jewelry nothing

Scott Lang No It’s a bust

Luis I’m really sorry Scotty I know you needed a score
we see an ant with a camera on its back nearby recording Scott take the suit inside his
lab Hank is watching Scott

back at Pym Technologies Cross is about to perform the shrinking experiments with a lamb

Hope van Dyne I thought we were using mice

Darren Cross What’s the difference Commence experiment 34C organic atomic
reduction

Hope van Dyne Darren maybe we should think

Darren Cross Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology I can’t go
to the buyers with half a breakthrough

Cross initiates the experiment and the lamb is vaporized to goo to Hope’s shock
Darren Cross Experiment 34C results Negative to the lab tech Sanitize the
workstation bring in subject 35C

back at Luis’s apartment in the bathroom Scott looks at the suit he took from the safe

Scott Lang Why would you lock this up

he takes out the suit and looks at the helmet

Scott Lang So weird

he tries the suit on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror
Luis Scott what’s up man

Scott closes the shower curtain then looks at the buttons on the gloves

Scott Lang I wonder what is this

he presses the buttons and shrinks down to a tiny size

in his tiny form Scott stand and looks around him in shock Scott then hears Hank’s
voice speaking through the mask

Dr Hank Pym The world sure seems different from down here doesn’t it Scott
Scott Lang What Who who said that

Scott sees Luis open the shower curtains to take a shower

Scott Lang Luis Luis down here

Dr Hank Pym It’s a trial by fire Scott Or in this case water

Luis turns on the water after getting splashed around Scott falls out of the bathtub and
onto the floor

e Dr Hank Pym Guess you’re tougher than you thought

e Scott hears Luis about to get undressed

e Scott Lang Oh I don’t want to see this

e as Luis drops his trousers onto the floor it knocks Scott through a hole in the apartment
below

e Scott Lang Luis Ahh Son ofa

e Scott falls into an apartment where a party is going on he narrowly avoids getting
stepped on before falling through the vent into another apartment gets sucked into a
hoover breaks out encounters a mouse then runs into a trap and is launched out the
window where he returns to his normal size on top of a cab

e Cab Driver What the hell

e Dr Hank Pym Not bad for a test drive Keep the suit I’ be in touch

e Scott Lang No no No thank you

Scott packs the suit up and sneaks it back into house and returns it into the safe but the police
are waiting for him as he goes to leave

e Cop on Speaker Put it down on the ground You are under arrest

e Scott Lang No I didn’t steal anything I was returning something I stole

e Scott realizes he’s admitted to stealing and reluctantly kneels on the ground as he’s
arrested

Paxton visits Scott as he’s sat in his cell

e Paxton You know you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your
ways They were really rooting for you It’s gonna break their hearts

e Detective You got a visitor

e Scott Lang Who

e Detective Your lawyer

e Scott Lang My lawyer

e Scott is taken to a room where Pym is sat waiting for him

e Dr Hank Pym I told you Id be in touch Scott I’m starting to think that you prefer the
inside of a jail cell

e Scott Lang Oh man

e Dr Hank Pym Sit down

e we see ants crawling over the camera in the room to obscure the conversation

e Scott Lang Sir I’m sorry I stole the suit I don’t even want to know why you have it

e Dr Hank Pym Maggie was right about you

e Scott Lang How do you know about

e Dr Hank Pym The way she’s trying to keep you away from Cassie The moment things
get hard you turn right back to crime The way I see it you have a choice You can either
spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions

e Scott Lang I don’t understand

e Dr Hank Pym No I don’t expect you to But you don’t have many options right now
Quite frankly neither do I Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place

e Scott Lang What
flashback to Pym giving money to his housekeeper Emily so that she can tip Luis’s friends to
tip off about the job

Dr Hank Pym Second chances don’t come around all that much So next time you
think you might see one I suggest you take a real close look at it

Pym rises and leaves the room

Maggie Lang referring to the ugly rabbit toy Scott gave her as Maggie is putting Cassie
to sleep Are you sure you don’t want a different toy

Maggie Lang Are you sure you don’t want a different toy

Cassie Lang No I love this one

Maggie Lang Okay Well get some sleep then I love you Maggie kisses Cassie on her
head

Cassie Lang Mommy

Maggie Lang Hm

Cassie Lang Is daddy a bad man I heard some grownups say he’s bad

Maggie Lang No Daddy just gets confused sometimes you know

as Scott is sat in his cell thinking several ants bring Scott the suit in its tiny form then enlarge it
so that Scott can wear it he quickly slip into it zaps himself small to escape

Dr Hank Pym Smart choice You actually listened for once
Scott runs out of the cell

Dr Hank Pym Under the door

as the prison alarm goes off Scott runs out of the building
Scott Lang Okay Where to now

Dr Hank Pym Hang tight

some ants approach Scott

Scott Lang What What

inside the police station

Paxton Where the hell did he go

Detective I have no idea he just vanished into his radio Set up a five block perimeter

Scott Lang Huh You got a camera on an ant Yeah sure why not Where’s the car

a large winged ant flies over Scott and lands in front of him

Dr Hank Pym Put your foot on the central node and not the thorax

Scott Lang Are you ki How safe’s this

Dr Hank Pym Get on the damn ant Scott

Scott gets on the ant and as it flies off the police go on a manhunt for him

the winged ant has landed on a police car that’s looking for Scott

Scott Lang Why am I on a police car Shouldn’t I not be on a police car

e Scott Lang Whoa Alright Now what’s the next move

e as the ant flies up

e Scott Lang No no no no Vertigo vertigo

e Dr Hank Pym No I think it’s 2-47

e Scott Lang Wait

e Dr Hank Pym Hang on Scott

e Scott Lang Yeah I’m getting a little light it’s funny hit me and

e as the ant continues to fly Scott feels dizzy and falls off the ant’s back

Scott wakes up in a bedroom and jumps up in shock when he sees Hope watching over him

e Scott Lang Hello Who are you Have you been standing there watching me sleep this
whole time

e Hope van Dyne Yes

e Scott Lang Why

e Hope van Dyne Because the last time you were here you stole something

e Scott Lang Oh Oh Hey look

e Scott goes to get out of bed but recoils when he sees insects crawling all over the floor

e¢ Scott Lang Whoa

e¢ Hope van Dyne Paraponera clavata Giant tropical bullet ants Ranked highest on the
Schmidt pain index They’re here to keep an eye on you when I can’t Dr Pym’s waiting
for you downstairs

e she turns and walks out of the room

e Scott Lang Who calling out to Hope Hey um whose pajamas are these gets no
response How am I supposed to do this
Scott puts his foot down tentatively onto the floor and the ants make space for his foot
Scott Lang Right just one step at a time

he slowly stops towards the door as the ants make room for his feet

Scott Lang Ugh You don’t bite me I don’t step on you deal

in the dining hall

Hope van Dyne Take down the servers and Cross wouldn’t even know it We don’t need
this guy Scott enters the dining room where Pym and Hope are sat

Dr Hank Pym I assume that you’ve already met my daughter Hope

Scott Lang I did She’s great

Dr Hank Pym She doesn’t think that we need you

Hope van Dyne We don’t We can do this ourselves

Dr Hank Pym I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit and then Hope has you
arrested

Hope van Dyne Okay we can try this and when he fails Ill do it myself

Dr Hank Pym She’s a little bit anxious It has to do with this job which judging by the
fact that you’re sitting opposite me I take it that you’re interested in

Scott Lang What job

Dr Hank Pym Would you like some tea

Scott Lang Uh sure Pym pours Scott some tea

Dr Hank Pym I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security
system Freezing that metal was particularly clever

Scott Lang Were you watching me

Dr Hank Pym Scott I’ve been watching you for a while ever since you robbed Vista
Corp Oh excuse me burgled Vista Corp Scott see Hope smile to herself Vista’s
security system is one of the most advanced in the business It’s supposed to be
unbeatable but you beat it Would you like some sugar

Scott Lang Yeah thanks he sees two ants pushing two sugar cubes on the table
towards his cup You know what I’m okay referring to the ants How do you make
them do that

Dr Hank Pym Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight They build farm they
cooperate with each other

Scott Lang Right But how do you make them do that he sees the ants returning the
sugar cubes into their bowl

Dr Hank Pym use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center I
speak to them I can go anywhere hear anything and see everything

Hope van Dyne And still know absolutely nothing I’m late to meet Cross Hope gets
up and leaves Scott raises his hand to ask a question

Scott Lang Uh Dr Pym

Dr Hank Pym You don’t need to raise your hand Scott

Scott Lang Sorry I just have one question Who are you Who is she What the hell’s
going on and can I go back to jail now

Dr Hank Pym Come with me Pym takes Scott to his lab Twenty years ago I created a
formula that altered atomic relative distance

Scott Lang Huh

Dr Hank Pym I learned how to change the distance between atoms that’s what powers
the suit that’s why it works they enter Pym’s lab
Scott Lang Whoa

Dr Hank Pym But it was dangerous It was too dangerous So I hid it from the world
And that’s when I switched gears and I started my own company

Scott Lang Pym Tech

Dr Hank Pym Yes I took on a young protégé called Darren Cross

Scott Lang Darren Cross He’s a big deal

Dr Hank Pym But before he was a big deal he was my assistant I thought I saw
something in him a son I never had perhaps He was brilliant but as we became close he
began to suspect that I wasn’t telling him everything He heard rumors about what was
called the Pym Particles and he became obsessed with recreating my formula But I
wouldn’t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company
Scott Lang How could he do that

Dr Hank Pym The board’s chairman is my daughter Hope She was the deciding vote
But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula
The process is highly volatile What isn’t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the
brain’s chemistry I don’t think Darren realizes this and you know he’s not the most
stable guy to begin with

Scott Lang So what do you want from me

Dr Hank Pym Scott I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption Do you
Scott Lang I do

Dr Hank Pym If you can help me I promise I can help you be with your daughter
again Now are you ready to redeem yourself

Scott Lang Absolutely My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done What
do you want me to do

Dr Hank Pym I want you to break into a place and steal some shit Paxton receives a
text from his partner Gale as he’s sat having breakfast with Maggie and Cassie
Maggie Lang You going to be home for dinner tonight Paxton reads the text “Lang’s
“Lawyer” is Dr Hank Pym as in Pym Tech

Paxton Uh yeah I’ll pick something up text you

Maggie Lang Okay Good news Paxton gets up to leave

Paxton Uh I don’t know It’s news

Cassie Lang Are you trying to find my daddy

Paxton Yeah I am sweetheart I just want your daddy to be safe

Cassie Lang Hope you don’t catch him Pym is showing Scott photos of the people he
used to worked with

Dr Hank Pym This isn’t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game
changing weaponry That’s Mitchell Carson ex-head of defense at SHIELD presently in
the business of toppling governments He always wanted my tech and now unless we
break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data Darren Cross is gonna
unleash chaos upon the world

Scott Lang I think our first move should be calling the Avengers

Dr Hank Pym I’ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of
a Stark I’m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now This is not some cute
technology like the Iron Man suit This could change the texture of reality Besides
they’re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky

Scott Lang Okay then why don’t you just send the ants
e Dr Hank Pym Scott they are ants Ants they can do a lot of things but they still need a
leader Somebody that can infiltrate a place that’s designed to prevent infiltration

e Scott Lang Hank I’m a thief Alright I’m a good thief But this is insane just then
Hope enters the lab

e Hope van Dyne He’s right Hank and you know it You’ve seen the footage you know
what Cross is capable of I was against using him when we had months now we have
days I’m wearing the suit

e Dr Hank Pym Absolutely not

e¢ Hope van Dyne I know the facility inside and out I know how Cross thinks I know this
mission better than anybody here

e Dr Hank Pym We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work

e Hope van Dyne We don’t have time to screw around

e Dr Hank Pym Hope please Listen to me please

e Hope van Dyne He is a criminal I’m your daughter

e Dr Hank Pym No Pym turns and sits down Hope walks off in disappointment

e Scott Lang She’s right Hank I’m not your guy Why don’t you wear the suit

e Dr Hank Pym You think I don’t want to I can’t I spent years wearing it It took a toll
on me You’re our only option Before Hope lost her mother she used to look at me like I
was the greatest man in the world And now she looks at me and it’s just disappointment
It’s too late for me but not for you This is your chance The chance to earn that look in
your daughter’s eyes to become the hero that she already thinks you are It’s not about
saving our world it’s about saving theirs

e Scott Lang Damn that was a good speech

e Dr Hank Pym Scott I need you to be the Ant-Man
we see Scott wearing the Ant-Man suit with Pym and Hope training him

e Dr Hank Pym In the right hands the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic
The suit has power the man harnesses that power You need to be skillful agile and
above all you need to be fast You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime so your
size always suits your needs Hope closes the door Now dive through the keyhole
Scott You charge big you dive small then you emerge big Scott puts on the helmet and
charges for the keyhole

e Scott Lang Ow we hear him fail several times as he continues to shrink and dive
through the keyhole Ah Ow

e¢ Hope van Dyne to Pym Useless

Hope trains Scott

e Hope van Dyne When you’re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two
hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide you’re like a bullet You
punch too hard you kill someone too soft it’s a love-tap In other words you have to
know how to punch

e Scott Lang I was in prison for three years I know how to punch

¢ Hope van Dyne Show me she puts up her hands and Scott hits her hand Terrible
Scott Lang You want to show me how to punch he puts up his hand like hers Show
me suddenly Hope punches him in the face knocking him back

Hope van Dyne That’s how you punch

Dr Hank Pym She’s been looking forward to this

Scott Lang No kiddin’

Dr Hank Pym Hope trained in martial arts at a uh difficult time

Hope van Dyne Oh by difficult time he means when my mother died

Dr Hank Pym We lost her in a plane crash

Hope van Dyne It’s bad enough you won’t tell me how she died could you please stop
telling me that lie We’re working here as Scott is still recovering from her punch
Alright princess let’s get back to work

Scott Lang Were you going for the hand

Pym finds Scott playing around with the suit’s regulator

Scott Lang You know I think this regulator is holding me back

Dr Hank Pym Do not screw with the regulator If that regulator is compromised you
would go sub-atomic

Scott Lang What does that mean

Dr Hank Pym It means that you would enter a quantum realm

Scott Lang What does that mean

Dr Hank Pym It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and
space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity Everything that you know and
love gone forever

Scott Lang Cool Yeah I’m if it ain’t broke

return to training

Dr Hank Pym You’ve learned about the suit but you’ve yet to learn about your
greatest allies the ants Loyal brave and your partners on this job

Pym and Hope watch as Scott shrinks in their back garden and goes running under the earth

Hope van Dyne Paratrechina longicornis commonly known as crazy ants they’re
lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy
electronics Scott comes across a crazy ant

Scott Lang Oh you’re not so crazy the crazy ant jumps on him knocking Scott back
Hey You’re cute suddenly a herd of crazy ants crawl all over Scott Oh Aaah Scott
turns himself back to normal size and he pops up through the ground That was a lot
scarier a second ago

as they look at Pym Technologies building map

Scott Lang It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply
Hope van Dyne There’s a security guard posted around the clock we’ll need you to take
him out to deactivate the security systems
shrunk again and back under the earth Scott goes looking for more ants

e Scott Lang Okay Who’s next a massive ant comes up behind Scott

e Hope van Dyne Paraponera clavata

e Scott Lang I know Bullet ants right Number one on the Schmidt pain index to the
ants Hey guys Remember me from the bedroom as the ant goes to attack Scott pops
back up the through the ground in his normal size Whoa

return to the Pym Technologies building map

e Hope van Dyne The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point
is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter

e Scott Lang Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach

e Hope van Dyne The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down
for fifteen seconds

e Dr Hank Pym You’re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers
retrieve the suit and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on

return to training

e¢ Hope van Dyne looking at another ant Camponotus pennsylvanicus

e Dr Hank Pym Alternatively known as a carpenter ant Ideal for ground and air
transport

e Scott Lang Wait a minute I know this guy I’m going to call him Ant-thony

e Dr Hank Pym That’s good That’s very good because this time you’re really going to
have to learn how to control him we see the ants pushing sugar cubes on the table Tell
them to put the sugar in the teacup

we see Hope and Scott fight training this time Scott lands a painful blow to Hope

e Scott Lang Oh you okay d Hope suddenly punches Scott in the face and then
knocks him down with her legs

later as Scott is tending to his wound

e Hope van Dyne Hank wants you outside for target practice

e Dr Hank Pym The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs Red shrinks Blue
enlarges

e¢ Hope van Dyne referring to another species of ant Solenopsis mandibularis

e Dr Hank Pym Known for their bite the fire ants have evolved into remarkable
architects They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places

back to Scott trying to get some ants to put the sugar cubes into the teacup

e Dr Hank Pym You can do it Scott come on one of the ants flies off and Scott takes
off his earpiece in frustration
e Scott Lang They’re not listening to me

e Hope van Dyne You have to commit you have to mean it No shortcuts no lies

e Dr Hank Pym Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good Hope

e Hope van Dyne We don’t have time for coddling

e Dr Hank Pym Our focus should be on helping Scott

e Hope van Dyne Really Is that where our focus should be Hope picks up the earpiece
and uses it to instruct the ants to put the sugar cube into the teacup then she gets a herd
of ants to appear

e Dr Hank Pym Hope looking upset Hope walks over to Pym

e Hope van Dyne I don’t know why I came to you in the first place Hope leaves

e Dr Hank Pym We can’t do this without her

as Hope is about to leave in her car Scott gets in

e¢ Hope van Dyne Oh God

e Scott Lang You gotta lock your doors I mean really There’s some weird folks in this
neighborhood

e Hope van Dyne Do you think this is a joke Do you have any idea what he’s asking you
to risk You have a daughter

e Scott Lang I’m doing this for her

e Hope van Dyne You know when my mother died I didn’t see him for two weeks

e Scott Lang He was in grief

e Hope van Dyne Yeah so was I and I was seven And he never came back not in any
way that counted He just sent me off to boarding school You know I thought with all
that’s at stake just maybe we might have a chance at making peace But even now he still
wants to shut me out

e Scott Lang He doesn’t want to shut you out He trusts you

e Hope van Dyne Then why are you here

e Scott Lang It proves that he loves you Hope Look at me I’m expendable that’s why
I’m here You must’ve realized that by now I mean that’s why I’m in the suit and you’re
not He’d rather lose than fight than lose you Anyway Scott goes to get out of the car

e Hope van Dyne You know I didn’t know you had a a daughter when I called the cops
on you What’s her name

e Scott Lang Cassie

e Hope van Dyne It’s a pretty name You have to clear your mind Scott You have to
make your thoughts precise that’s how it works Think about Cassie about how badly
you want to see her and use that to focus she gives Scott the earpiece back to talk to the
ants and places a coin on the dashboard Open your eyes and just think about what you
want the ants to do couple of ants arrive and Scott gets them to pick up the coin That’s
good they watch as Scott gets the ants to spin the coin

Hope and Scott enter back into the house where Pym is waiting
e Dr Hank Pym Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions They

called her the Wasp She was born to it And there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t
regret having said yes It was 1987 separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk
and launched an ICBM at the United States The only way to the internal mechanics was
through solid titanium

in flashback we see Pym in his Ant-Man suit and his wife in her Wasp suit intercepted the
missile

e Dr Hank Pym I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile but
my regulator had sustained too much damage Your mother she didn’t hesitate

we see Janet shrinking herself to stop the missile
e Dr Hank Pym Janet No
flash-forward

e Dr Hank Pym She turned off her regulator and went sub-atomic to deactivate the
bomb She was gone Your mom died a hero And I spent the next ten years trying to
learn all I could about the quantum realm

e Hope van Dyne You were trying to bring her back

e Dr Hank Pym But all I learned was we know nothing

e¢ Hope van Dyne It’s not your fault She made her choice But why didn’t you tell me this
sooner

e Dr Hank Pym I was trying to protect you I lost your mother I didn’t mean to lose you
too Hope begins to cry

e Hope van Dyne I’m sorry

e Scott Lang This is awesome It’s awesome you know You guys are breaking down
walls you’re healing It’s important Hope and Pym turn to look at him I ruined the
moment didn’t I

e Dr Hank Pym Yes you did yes

e Scott Lang I’m gonna make some tea Scott turns and leaves

we see Scott finally shrink down and dive through the keyhole
e Scott Lang Nailed it
he then goes under the earth gets to fly on an ant
e Scott Lang That’s a good boy Ant-thony
we see him successfully work with the ants getting them to follow him

e Scott Lang The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion

we see Scott in his shrunken form on the side of a plane

e Scott Lang It’s freezing You couldn’t make a suit with a flannel lining
back in Pym’s lab

e Dr Hank Pym We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy it’s a device that I
invented from my SHIELD days

e¢ Hope van Dyne We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed
in the Futures vault

e Dr Hank Pym It’s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark’s old storage
facilities in upstate New York Should be a piece of cake

back to plane
e Scott Lang You’re over the target area Disengage now Scott
back on the plane Scott instructs the ants

e Scott Lang Squadron A go B go C go Alright Ant-thony please don’t drop me this
time they jump off the plane Ah it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this

e Dr Hank Pym Stay calm

e Scott Lang Uh guys we might have a problem Hank didn’t you say this was some old
warehouse It’s not we see that the warehouse is the new Avengers base You son of a
bitch

e Hope van Dyne Scott get out of there

e Dr Hank Pym Abort Abort now

e Scott Lang No it’s okay It doesn’t look like anyone’s home Ant-thony get me to the
roof

e Dr Hank Pym He’s gonna lose the suit

e Hope van Dyne He’s gonna lose his life

Scott lands in the roof of the new Avengers base

e Scott Lang Alright I’m on the roof of the target building

e¢ Hope van Dyne Somebody’s home Scott just then Sam Wilson in his Falcon flies in

e Voice over Radio on Sam’s radio What’s going on down there Sam

e Scott Lang It’s the Falcon

e Sam Wilson into his radio I had a sensor trip but I’m not seeing anything Wait a
second

e Dr Hank Pym Abort Scott Abort now

e Scott Lang It’s okay he can’t see me

e Sam Wilson I can see you

e Scott Lang He can see me Scott enlarges himself back to normal size and waves to
Falcon Hi I’m Scott

to Pym back in the lab as they listen to Scott

e¢ Hope van Dyne Did he just say “Hi I’m Scott”
back to Avengers HQ

e Sam Wilson What are you doing here

e Scott Lang First off I’m a big fan

e¢ Sam Wilson Appreciate it So who the hell are you

e Scott Lang I’m Ant-Man Sam smiles Ant-Man

e Scott Lang What you haven’t heard of me No you wouldn’t have heard of me

e Sam Wilson You want to tell me what you want

e Scott Lang I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days and then
return it I need it to save the world You know how that is

e Sam Wilson I know exactly how that is into his radio Located the breach Bringing
him in

e Scott Lang Sorry about this just as Sam goes to grab Scott he shrinks himself hits
Sam and runs off

e Dr Hank Pym What the hell are you doing Sam chases after Scott

e Sam Wilson Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech Sam flies in
and lands to stamp on Scott but Scott manages to intercept it and fights off Sam

e Scot Lang Sorry Sorry about this Sorry Scott jumps around Sam while punching him

e¢ Sam Wilson That’s enough Sam punches Scott as he jumps at him

e Scott Lang Ant-thony a little help Ant-thony flies in Scott jump on his back and they
fly into a vent and Sam goes to find him

e Dr Hank Pym I’ve lost visual suddenly Sam bursts through one of the facility doors

e Sam Wilson He’s inside my pack

e Scott Lang Sorry You seem like a really great guy they fight but Scott gets manages
to disable Sam’s flight pack then flies off on Ant-thony into his radio

e Sam Wilson It’s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this

back to Pym house

e Dr Hank Pym That was completely irresponsible and dangerous You jeopardized
everything Scott takes Pym’s signal decoy out of his pocket and places it on the table

¢ Hope van Dyne You got it Scott nods his head

e Dr Hank Pym Well done

e Scott Lang Wait a minute Did you just compliment me He did didn’t he

e Hope van Dyne Kind of sounded like he did

e Dr Hank Pym I was good wasn’t I

e Scott Lang Hey how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn’t die

e Dr Hank Pym Now let’s not dwell on the past We gotta finish our planning Pym
turns and leaves with the signal decoy

e Hope van Dyne Don’t mind him You did good Pym enters his living room to find
Cross standing there

e Dr Hank Pym Darren How the hell did you get in here Pym closes the door

e Darren Cross You left the front door open Hank It’s official You’re old Hope and
Scott hear them from the kitchen

e¢ Hope van Dyne The plans He will kill him back with Cross and Pym

e Dr Hank Pym Well to what do I owe this pleasure
e Darren Cross I have good news

e Dr Hank Pym Really What’s that

e Darren Cross Pym Tech the company you created is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world We’re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow
alone Pym says nothing at the same time Scott gets some ants to roll up their plans on
the nearby table You’re welcome I know this is odd but I’d like you to be there This is
my moment I want you to see it

e Dr Hank Pym Sure Darren Yeah sure I’ll be there

e¢ Darren Cross What did you see in me

e Dr Hank Pym I don’t know what you mean

e Darren Cross All those years ago you picked me What did you see

e Dr Hank Pym I saw myself

e Darren Cross Then why did you push me away

e Dr Hank Pym Because I saw too much of myself Cross turns and leaves after Cross
leaves

e Hope van Dyne He knows he’s baiting you We have to call it off

e Dr Hank Pym We’re all taking risks

e Hope van Dyne What if he saw me here

e Dr Hank Pym He didn’t There’s no way

e Hope van Dyne How do you know that just then Hope gets a call from Cross Darren
hi

e Darren Cross Hope where are you right now

e Hope van Dyne I’m at home why

e Darren Cross I just saw Hank I still get nothing but contempt from him

e Hope van Dyne Don’t let him rile you up he’s just he’s just a senile old man

e Darren Cross We need to start everyone working around the clock get the assembly
line up and running And I’m tripling security Full sensors at all entrances and exterior
air vents fitted with steel micro mesh

e Hope van Dyne Great Good idea

e Darren Cross Thank you Hope I’m so lucky to have you on my team

e Hope van Dyne He’s tripling security he’s lost his mind and he’s on to you

e Dr Hank Pym But he is not on to you

e Hope van Dyne He’s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior
vents How are we gonna get Scott inside

e Scott Lang The water main You can’t add security to a water main The pressure is too
strong but if we can decrease it that’s how I get in

e Hope van Dyne Somebody would have to reach the building’s control center to change
the water pressure I mean Hank and I will be beside Cross how are we supposed to do
that

e Scott Lang So we expand our team What do we need A fake security guard on the
inside to depressurize the water system somebody else to hack into the power supply and
kill the laser grid and a getaway guy

e Dr Hank Pym No no No no no Not those three wombats No way

Hope provides three cups of coffee for Luis Dave and Kurt
e Luis Thank you for the coffee ma’am It’s not too often that you rob a place and then
get welcomed back Because we just robbed you

e¢ Hope van Dyne to Scott You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie
machine right

e Luis Two smoothie machines

e Hope van Dyne Are you sure they can handle this

e Luis Oh we can handle it we’re professionals

e Dr Hank Pym You’ forgive us if we’re not instilled with confidence

e Dave Wait everybody Just kick back and relax a little bit man we know our business
We broke into this spooky-ass house didn’t we

e Dr Hank Pym I let you

e Dave Well one could say that I let you let me

e Scott Lang Look it’s okay They can handle this

e Luis Yeah we can handle it

e Scott Lang You got their credentials

e Hope van Dyne He’s in the system

e Luis I’m in the system

e Dave The system

e Luis The system

e Dr Hank Pym Yeah We’re doomed

e Scott Lang Alright there’s something you guys need to see

a little while later as Pym is showing Luis Dave and Kur their plans Scott walks in wearing the
Ant-Man suit

e¢ Luis Damn Whoa That’s so cool bro

e Scott Lang Now look this is gonna get weird alright It’s pretty freaky but it’s safe
There’s no reason to be scared

e Luis Aw no no Daddy don’t get scared

e Scott Lang Really

e Luis Yeah

e Scott Lang Good Scott shrinks himself freaking out Luis Dave and Kurt

e Luis Oh

e Kurt This is the work of the gypsies

e Dave That’s that’s that’s witchcraft

e Luis Oh that’s amazing That’s like some David Copperfield shit

e Dave That’s some kind of wizardry

e Kurt Sorcery

e Luis Ahh Ahh Get off Get off Ahh Luis runs off trying to get Scott off his
shoulder

e Scott Lang I thought daddy didn’t get scared

Luis Dave and Kurt have all fallen asleep on the couch

e Hope van Dyne I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the
suit to them Fell right asleep
e Scott Lang Hey look I want to thank you for

e Hope van Dyne No please don’t We’re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any
one of us I’m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off

e Scott Lang Hey Thank you you know for that pep talk

e Hope van Dyne You know the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to
almost liking you

e Scott Lang You really should write poetry Hope laughs

e Hope van Dyne Get some sleep Scott Hope leaves

later that night Scott uses the Ant-Man suit to go and visit his daughter in her room as she
sleeps outside Pym Technologies

e Scott Lang Alright just so we’re clear everyone here knows their role right Dave

e Dave Wheels on the ground

e Scott Lang Kurt

e Kurt Eyes in the sky

e Scott Lang Luis

e Luis Aw man you know it You know what I get to wear a uniform that’s what’s up

e Scott Lang Luis

e Luis I’m sorry I mean I’m good I’m good I’m just excited and plus you’re
girlfriend’s really hot so you know that makes me nervous too to Hope And you are
very beautiful ma’am

e Dr Hank Pym Oh my lord

e Scott Lang She’s not my

e Luis Hey you know what I was thinking of a tactic like when I go undercover like a
whistling you know I’m saying To like blend in

e Scott Lang No don’t whistle No whistling It’s not the Andy Griffith Show No
whistling

on the night of the charity event Luis makes it in employed as a security guard outside Dave
and Kurt are in their van with Scott in the back dressed in his suit

e Kurt We’re set

e Scott Lang Wish me luck Scott gets out shrinks himself as he goes through the water
main

e Kurt Utility is online

inside the building Luis starts whistling

e Alpha Guard Hey What are you doing

e Luis Uh boss-man said to secure the area So I’m securing

e Alpha Guard I’m the boss

e Luis Oh

e Alpha Guard into his radio Utilities work room three Luis suddenly punches him
knocking him out unconscious and then lowers the water level

e Kurt Water level is dropping
Scott floats along on the water with the ants through the pipes

e¢ Kurt Coming up on extraction pipe

e Scott Lang I see it to the ants Alright come on I gotta get up there That’s it that’s it
guys yeah the ants help him climb up to the extraction pipe That’s it yeah Yes You
got it You got it come on Scott makes it through one of the handwash sinks in the
bathroom Alright let’s fly Ant-thony Scott and the ants fly off

e Kurt The Ant-Man is in the building

as they see Pym pull up outside the building where the charity event is taking place

e Dave Phshh Got a Crown Vic right outside over there

e Kurt This is problem

e Dave Considering the Crown Vic’s the most commonly used car for under-cover cops
man Yes this is a problem inside the Crown Vic is Paxton and Gale

e Paxton That’s Pym they get out to go after Pym

e Kurt Oh no

back with Scott and the ants

e Scott Lang I’m employing the bullet ants Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna I don’t
remember what it’s called but I feel bad for this guy using the ants Scott takes down one
of the security guards with Luis also punching him

e Luis See that’s what I’m talkin’ bout That’s what I call it an unfortunate casualty in a
very serious operation you know Hope then comes along and enters the room and
places the signal decoy

e Kurt Signal decoy in place Mean pretty lady did good Scott

e Dave Looks like Pym’s getting arrested

e Kurt Scott we have problem

e Scott Lang Problem What’s the problem just then Dave gets out of the can

e Kurt Dave Dave that’s not part of plan

e Dr Hank Pym as Paxton and Gale are trying to arrest Pym Listen to me if I don’t get
into this building people will die

e Gale That’s awfully dramatic

Dave creates a diversion by stealing Paxton and Gale’s car

e Paxton Are you kidding me they run after Dave as he drives off in their car
e Kurt Problem solved

inside the building Cross finds Hope

e Darren Cross Well How do I look they then find Pym as he enters the building
There he is Just in time Come on Cross takes them to vault where he’s keeping the
Yellowjacket suit and uses an eye scanner to open the door

e¢ Computer Twelve point verification
Dr Hank Pym Little over the top don’t you think Darren

Computer Confirming authorization

Darren Cross No you can never be too safe

Computer Access granted they enter the vault

Dr Hank Pym I gotta hand it to you Darren you really did it

Darren Cross And you only know the half of it Hank at the same time Carson arrives
with his men

back to Scott and the ants

Scott Lang Arriving at second position Alright top speed Ant-thony Let’s go Scott
and Ant-thony fly towards where the Yellowjacket suit is being kept Proceeding to
command position Scott jumps off Ant-thony I’ll be right back Ant-thony Alright
guys I’m in position I’m going to signal the ants Paxton and Gale find their car
dumped can crashed into a tree

Paxton No no no no Dave gets back into the van with Kurt

Dave Did you see that he honks the musical horn which Paxton recognizes from Scott
using it earlier

back to Scott instructing the ants

Scott Lang Assume formation Alright you cute little crazies let’s fry these servers the
ants fry the servers and Scott jumps back onto Ant-thony Let’s go get ‘em buddy
Kurt Servers are fried Data backup completely erased

Scott Lang Headed to the particle chamber

Carson and his men enters the vault where Cross is with Pym and Hope

Mitchell Carson Hello Dr Cross My associates agree to your terms

Darren Cross Wonderful to Pym They’re not what they were they’re doing some
interesting work And I’m enjoying myself You tried to hide your technology from me
and now it’s gonna blow up in your face suddenly Pym punches Cross in the face
Wow Wow I mean I saw the punch coming a mile away but I just figured it’d be all
pathetic and weak

Dr Hank Pym Well you figured wrong

back outside Paxton and Gale walk over to Luis’s van

Paxton I know this van he bangs on the van door Anybody home

Dave to each other inside the van Shh

Kurt Shh

Dave Shh

Kurt Shh

Scott Lang Alright guys I’m here Setting the charges Scott set the explosives to the
ants Great job guys I’ll take it from here Ant-thony sets Scott down Good boy Ant-
thony Final position to Kurt and Dave Guys how we lookin’ on that laser grid
Kurt Almost

Dave No you’re not

Kurt I’m getting close

Dave No you’re not Paxton keeps banging on Luis’s van door

Paxton San Francisco PD Man in the van I know you’re in there inside the van as
they wait for the laser grid to be disabled

Dave Make it go faster

Kurt Dude seriously

Scott Lang Ready to jump Do you read Kurt

Kurt It’s so close

Paxton suddenly the van door opens Paxton and Gale point their guns at Kurt and
Dave Freeze

Dave Okay wait a minute wait a minute there was a black guy that looked exactly like
me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van

Paxton Get out

Dave Take it easy

Kurt Paxton pulls Kurt out of the van at the same time the laser grid is disabled to
Scott Go Go now Scott jumps to get to the Yellowjacket Wait

Scott Lang What What do you mean wait Kurt manages to struggle free from
Paxton’s hold to press a button on his computer to fully disable the lasers and just as
Scott goes to grab the suit it’s pulled away What What Cross sees Scott and taps on
the glass

Darren Cross Hi little guy to Pym I always suspected you had a suit stored away
somewhere which begs the question who is the new Ant-Man Who is the man that my
beloved mentor trusted even more than me pauses a moment Scott Lang The martyr
who took on the system and paid the price losing his family and his only daughter in the
process Exactly your kind of guy Hank He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue
as to how and then he disappears magically despite having no money to his name and
now he brings me the Ant-Man suit the only thing that can rival my creation

Dr Hank Pym Darren don’t do this If you sell to these men it’s going to be chaos
Darren Cross already have and for twice the price thanks to you It’s not easy to
successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility Thankfully word travels fast Oh Pll sell
them the Yellowjacket but I’m keeping the particle to myself They don’t run on diesel
If you want the fuel you’ll have to come to me What do you call the only man who can
arm the most powerful weapon in the world

Dr Hank Pym The most powerful man in the world

Darren Cross You proud of me yet

points their gun at Pym

Hope van Dyne Darren what are you doing

this causes Cross to go subatomic and disappear

Cassie Lang Daddy where are you Scott floats through the quantum realm and
remembers Pym’s word

Dr Hank Pym voice Go sub-atomic go sub-atomic Scott tries to grow himself
back to normal size but realized he can’t
e Scott Lang Oh no he continues to float in the quantum realm

e Dr Hank Pym voice You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant And as you shrink for all eternity everything that you know and love
gone forever Scott hears Cassie’s voice echoing as he floats in the quantum realm

e Cassie Lang voice Daddy Where are you Daddy

e Scott Lang Cassie

e Cassie Lang voice Come on daddy Scott remembers the discs Pym had given him
and takes one out
