FIRST ROUGH DRAFT - ODYSSEUS11 21809

FADE IN

WRITTEN Twenty have passed since Odysseus king of Ithaca
hero and freedom fighter left home to fight in the Trojan War
and never returned He is believed to be dead

BOY’S VOICE(VO)
They were told the great Odysseus
would never come back That he’d
abandoned his home for glory in
battle His name was no longer
spoken His exploits soon forgotten
by all except a few Now Ithaca
the jewel of the Aegean was
without a king Odysseus’ throne
lay open and was the much desired
in the ancient world

EXT ITHACA - PREDAWN

HELICOPTER SHOT OF THE SLEEPING ISLAND as the sun’s first
rays catch the craggy hills encircling the undulating
central plains Ithaca is barren and rocky the soil dry and
unforgiving Patches of green - olive and pomegranate groves
pastures Goats and sheep graze Crudely built houses made of
sharp rocks here and there

PAN TO a PRIMITIVE SHRINE to ODYSSEUS with the name written
in gold relief lettering on the portico overlooks the sea
Down below a stretch of beach

A strikingly beautiful woman of regal bearing scans the
miles of ocean This is PENELOPE (thirties) queen of Ithaca
She is simply clothed

A holy man ACLINOUS the SEER attends her She unwinds a
brilliant purple cloth from around her and plucks out a
single thread which she casts onto the breeze

It’s a daily ritual for her

INT ODYSSEUS’S PALACE - DINING HALL - DAY

TWO WOODEN THRONE-LIKE CHAIRS crudely carved side by side
These pieces of wood are the chairs of a king and queen

Penelope’s FIVE DRUNKEN SUITORS are sitting at the long table
eating and drinking noisily They’re loud uncouth and horny
PENELOPE sits at a loom piously weaving
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 2

It’s obvious to us she’s putting on an act - she’s too
beautiful and regal to genuinely enjoy such a dull pursuit
The suitors are too stupid and arrogant to get it

SUITOR 1
(slurred)
How much longer must we wait for
your hand The king is not alive
Were impatient to know your will

He points at the LARGER of the TWO THRONE CHAIRS

She replies a mischievous sparkle in her eye She’s jerking
them around

PENELOPE
(graceful)
Ah Lucas We all know that not
just any man can be king of Ithaca
Not just any man can take the place
of Odysseus not so

She prompts a SERVANT GIRL with her eyes to ply them with
more drinks

SUITOR 2
(amorously)
My sweet Penelope

PENELOPE
A new king must know right from
wrong Lupus A new king will have
to fill the shoes of Odysseus

LUCAS smiles He’s drunk and now he’s enchanted by the
servant girl He gives her breast a little squeeze

LUCAS
(distracted)
Of course my queen

PENELOPE
(coyly indicates the
cloth)
See Almost there Be patient
lords Your time is coming

They’re turned on by this She gives them a seductive smile
We know it’s fake They don’t Underneath lies the pain of
not knowing Odysseus’ fate

EXT SEA OFF ITHACA —- ON BOATS - A NEW DAWN

MEN in peak condition bearing GRUESOME SCARS of battle
thrust their oars into the sea with perfect precision Their
disfigurements - gouged out eyes hacked off ears stumps for
noses jagged scars depressions in foreheads and skulls -
mark them with an inhuman look The disparate features and
skin colors - and their armor - speak of FOREIGN lands

Every RIGHT BICEP sports a tatoo of an A encircled with
leaves

PULL BACK and THREE LONG BOATS manned by TEN oarsmen apiece
tows a heavily laden SUPPLY BOAT behind it The supply boat
sits low in the water weighed down by HORSES and provisions
The boats cut an arrow straight course towards an island that
rises out of a flat sea on the horizon

At the helm of the lead boat a man has his sights set on the
island which at this moment with the rising sun behind it
seems to shine like a jewel And so it is - the jewel of the
Aegean THIS IS ITHACA

The sight of it elicits a roar and fires them with enthusiasm
to plunge their ores in and cut through the water

The LEADER is ANTONINUS(late thirties) His face obscured by

a metal MASK with only his eyes and mouth revealed - the
philtrum split in half by a seam of shiny keloid The skin on
his CHIN is puckered and shiny tugging his chin to his neck -
evidence of burning His mighty shoulders criss-crossed with
scars

CUT TO

The boats gliding in on the waves that break onto a remote
beach at the rear rocky side of the island Reaching the
shallows a HAND SIGN from Antoninus passes from boat to boat
- the signal for a detachment from each boat to put up their
oars and leap over the side and guide the boats in

One of them is a NUBIAN This is ARCHEAS the gladiator
ALL COMMUNICATIONS ARE BY HAND SIGN Instant clear silent
CUT TO

Blindfolded horses clatter off the boats They are huge

battle steeds rippling with muscle They barely hit the
ground when their blindfolds are ripped off their mounts are
in the saddle and their massive hooves are grabbing the sand -
urged on by the riders who aim for the hills swords and
spears unsheathed
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 4

Antoninus on a black horse watches his men spring into
action It’s seamless Clearly this has been planned Every
man knows his part

CUT TO
EXT ITHACA - DAWN - LATER

Houses here and there No sign of smoke from the chimneys
All is quiet Unsuspecting

THE THRUM OF HOOVES heralds the arrival of RIDERS Archeas’
distinctive head crests the hill first The riders fan out
and sweep their way across the sleeping island

CUT TO
A cluster of squat stone cottages next to an olive grove A
bucolic scene Chickens still in their crofts Sleepy eyed
goats quietly nuzzle the dew laden grass
A POOR PEASANT exits a house and crosses to the WELL
muttering soothing sounds to the animals He starts pulling
water from the WELL
The SOUND OF HOOVES He looks up with shocked surprise as
dozens of men in all different styles of armor - but equally
terrifying - appear out of nowhere and bear down on him The
riders are led by a burly BLACK MAN

The farmer drops the bucket and tears towards the house He’s
cut down before he reaches the front door

SCREAMS
CUT TO
RIDERS chasing down fleeing people and cutting them to
pieces A FRIGHTENED CHILD watches the riders TORCHING
HOUSES
AN OLD MAN stands in the path of the horses
OLD MAN
Stop This is the island of the
great Odysseus

He is mowed down

CUT TO
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 5

A DEAD SHEPHERD is impaled with a SPEAR as riders round up
his horses and livestock and herd them away

CUT TO

A MAN with his terrified family gathered behind him watches
through their doorway as the soldiers slaughter some men who
try and fight back The man is PATROCHLUS a childhood
friend of Odysseus and he’s not so much afraid as he is
taking stock of these strange invaders He grips onto his hot
headed son PHEMIUS PATROCHLUS
(shoves him)
Tell Emmeaus Go

The boy takes off
CUT TO

Phemius arms pumping races through the woods clearing
fences clambering somersaulting streaking along

CUT TO

Phemius arriving at a hut - there’s already a solid column of
smoke coming from the chimney Nearby a pen houses a small
herd of PIGS

PHEMIUS
Emmeaus Emmeaus

An elderly man pokes his head out of the door He’s holding
his firing tongs This is EMMEAUS foundryman and swineherd
loyal servant of Odysseus

CUT TO

Emmeaus and Phemius springing into action - snatching up
swords and spears from the cooling racks They toss them into
a large hole hiding them and then cover it over with a pile
of firewood

CUT TO
The soldiers chopping the FOUNDRY to pieces sending the
anvils flying scattering coals and instruments Emmeaus
watches expressionless from under hooded eyes his hand on
Phemius’ shoulder

CUT TO

Riders descending upon the bay where Ithacan FISHING BOATS
are getting ready for the day’s catch
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 6

A bustle of activity as FISHING NETS are strung between
poles splayed out to dry DRYING RACKS are thick with salted
FISH drying This is the lifeblood of Ithaca Clearly a
thriving industry

USING THE HAND SIGNS the invaders attack in disciplined
groups THEY slash the nets overturn the drying racks cut
the dock lines overrun the boats hack fishermen and the
boats to pieces

One by one the vessels sink under the water leaving a trail
of bubbles gurgling to the surface BODIES bob face down on
the swells

On the shore the water is a smoky red with blood

CUT TO

A WIDE SHOT OF ITHACA Murder happening everywhere Dead
bodies littering pathways

CUT TO
STATUES OF ODYSSEUS face the rising sun and look down on the
sea below The riders sweep in amongst the forest of statues

smashing them to pieces

Odysseus’ eyes stare lifelessly out of his decapitated marble
head on the gravel

CUT TO
Soldiers cordoning off the WELLS and tall brick GRANARIES
SCREAMING AND CRYING

CUT TO
MID MORNING The sun blazes down on a horrifying SCENE
VILLAGERS are being herded to an open field for SELECTION
They’re weeding out the old and sick taking the pretty
girls separating the strong men from their families
All around us women are keening children clinging to their
mothers Husbands separated from wives Old people culled

like they’re vermin

Antoninus walks through the carnage unmoved He smells the
air It smells like death He turns to

A FAMILY - a young BOY (TIRESIUS) his mother and PRETTY
SISTER the father
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 7

A SOLDIER grabs the girl (TYRO) and throws her over his
shoulder The girl is kicking and screaming

TYRO
No no Help me

The father launches himself at the soldier who cuts him down
with one thrust of his sword He collapses dying and the
mother runs to her husband cradling him as he dies

MOTHER
Marcus

The mother turns to Antoninus

MOTHER (CONT’D)
Please

Antoninus approaches her Walks right up to her She looks up
at him He is backlit by the sun and just a silhouette We
cant tell if he is feeling any mercy The woman bows her
head

MOTHER (CONTD)
In the name of Odysseus spare my
family

HER POV Antoninus armored legs Suddenly A SWORD PLUNGES
right in front of her face down into her cradled husbands
chest She looks up in horror and within a heartbeat
Antoninus pulls his sword out of her husband and thrusts it
right into her face

The soldier makes off with the screaming daughter who yells
to her younger brother who has witnessed this with
dumbstruck horror

TYRO
Tiresius

Tiresius mad with desperation rushes at the soldier biting
kicking yelling The soldier thinks this is hilarious as he
swats at the flailing boy He gives Tiresius a hard kick that
sends him flying

MOMENTS LATER

THE BRANDING OF THE MEN

All ADULT MEN woman and child is BRANDED on their LEFT
SHOULDER with the letter A

A WARRIOR questions a newly branded man
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 8
WARRIOR
How many guards did you say
The tortured man is in extreme pain
MAN
(rasps)
I told you five
FIND Patrochlus as Archeas brands him and his son Phemius
ANGLE ON A ROCK high and behind the mayhem
Concealed EMMEAUS watches
CUT TO
Soldiers jogging with loads of sharpened fence poles on their
shoulders makes their way along the well beaten track that
leads up to
THE PALACE OF ODYSSEUS
Strategically situated atop a prominent hill - back to the
ocean face to the valley This stone edifice is stark

lacking all embellishment - fittingly for the abode of a
warrior king It is lightly but proudly guarded

THE CHINK OF ARMOR
CUT TO

A DETACHMENT of FIVE mounted soldiers lead by Antoninus
descends on the palace Their faces are hidden behind MASKS

Their arrival draws PALACE GUARDS out weapons unsheathed

PALACE GUARDS
Yield Or die by the hand of
Odysseus

Antoninus’ men dismount They calmly approach the guards

ON ANTONINUS who stays on his horse a silent mysterious
figure

SOLDIER
(stays on his horse)
Yield Or die by the hand of
Antoninus

The Ithacan guards react immediately They attack Antoninus’
men The defenders seem at first to have the advantage
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 9

But they’re quickly decimated by the superior fighters Soon
only one palace guard is left He is beheaded

Antoninus calmly rides his horse through the carpet of dead
bodies

CUT TO

INT ODYSSEUS’ PALACE - CONTINUOUS

Alerted by the NOISE outside the terrified suitors are
panicking They run for their WEAPONS piled at the side wall
Nobody thinks to protect Penelope

Penelope grabs a SWORD herself

SUDDENLY the doors CRASH open and SOLDIERS storm into the
room All hell breaks loose

The suitors are too shocked to react

Within seconds all five of them are slaughtered and the floor
awash with blood

Penelope stands back shocked by the carnage All around her
INVADERS are streaming into the palace

She wields her sword facing the men
TELEMACHUS rushes to his mother’s side

TELEMACHUS
Mother

At that moment a COMMOTION at the door and ANTONINUS
clatters into the hall mounted on his huge horse The horse
raises its tail and shits loudly on the stone slabs

He sees Penelope

ANTONINUS
Greetings Queen Penelope Widow of
Odysseus

He makes an exaggerated gesture indicating the butchered
SUITORS

ANTONINUS (CONTD)
Look at the riff raff courting a
king’s wife disgracing the great
man’s house and home
(pointedly)
You’re welcome madam
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 10

Telemachus steps protectively in front of his mother

TELEMACHUS
I am Telemachus Son of Odysseus
the king of Ithaca

ANTONINUS
(matter of factly)
The king of Ithaca is dead

Antoninus removes the BREAST PLATE he’s wearing A soldier
hands it to Penelope

Her knees almost give way as she touches his name Odysseus
imprinted on it The finality of it

PENELOPE
When Where

ANTONINUS
The word is after the battle of
Priam he set sail for home but
got uh ‘waylaid’

Loud laughter from the soldiers confuses and frightens
Penelope

ANTONINUS (CONTD)
Trust me He’s not coming back
(smile)
My queen

Mother and son are instantly aware that Antoninus is no
savior but the enemy They draw back from the soldiers who
have formed a threatening circle around them

PENELOPE
Who are you Why are you here

ANTONINUS
To claim what is mine

Telemachus with a flourish draws his sword

Within milli-seconds the soldiers have Telemachus disarmed
and thrown on the ground with a foot on his neck sword at
his throat

Penelope fearlessly throws herself at the soldiers with her
sword hacking them She stabs a soldier in the leg They
roughly subdue her
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 11

ANTONINUS (CONTD)
Drop your sword or your son dies
It’s your choice

She is breathless Cornered She flings the sword away

ANTONINUS (CONTD)
Good choice

Antoninus struts on his horse in the high ceilinged Great
Room Directs his speech at Penelope While he speaks his
horse pees and we watch the spreading puddle creep towards
Telemachus’ face pressed into the floor tiles

ANTONINUS (CONTD)
Queen of Ithaca no need to mourn
Odysseus died happy in the loins of
the goddess Calypso I am your
protector now and unlike Odysseus
I will never abandon Ithaca

Penelope stares at Antoninus She’s holding down violent
emotions Then she drops the breast plate at his horse’s
feet

PENELOPE
You are no protector You’re a
savage

He kicks her in the mouth (he is on his horse) She falls on
the ground next to Telemachus

Antoninus feels his own keloid skin on his face in a strange
almost sexual way as his eyes travel over Penelope’s exposed
thighs

ANTONINUS

A pleasing view

(beat)
Fatherless Telemachus I take you
as my lieutenant and I will teach
you how to be a man Husbandless
Penelope I’1ll teach you how to be
a wife again

She spits out the horse piss and blood
CUT TO

Archeas his platoon covered in blood and gore assembled
behind him reports to Antoninus

ARCHEAS
Long live the new king of Ithaca
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 12
ON PENELOPE chained and defiant Telemachus impotent beside
his mother

Antoninus turns his face to her a look of manifest
malevolence

ANTONINUS
Take her below

Two soldiers jump to his command She’s clutching the breast
plate They tear it off her She’s kicking and screaming

Telemachus forgets his own life fighting for hers He’s
pulverized in seconds

ON ANTONINUS as we HEAR her SCREAMS recede He’s unmoved
From now on the breast plate will always on Antoninus
TITLE SEQUENCE EVERY SHOT IS TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY AS WE
WATCH TWO YEARS PASS BY ON ITHACA

An eight foot fence grows around the perimeter of the palace
cutting it off from the island

CUT TO

Hanged men and women their bodies pecked at by crows In
time lapse the bodies decompose to skeletons

The statues are pulled down boulder by boulder reduced to
rubble

CUT TO

BACK TO REAL TIME

DEAD QUIET A child’s filthy hands scrabble in the dirt They
grasp at bounty - a bird’s egg From hand to mouth The lips
gobble and crunch The tongue licks the trickling yolk

WIDER and it’s TIRESIUS the boy He’s gone feral Wild
child Orphaned Abandoned Foraging

This is what it has come to

Darkness descending on the land

INT ODYSSEUS’S PALACE - MAIN HALL - DAY

Antoninus sits on Odysseus’ throne at the banquet table He’s
eating
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 13
Across from him standing is Penelope Her ankles are
SHACKLED
He throws a block of bread to her It lands on the floor
Penelope turns her face away

ANTONINUS
Not hungry

He laughs

Her eyes drift to the window She looks out

INT PENELOPE’S CELL —- DAY

PENELOPE’S FACE looking out of a small slit in the wall Her
only view of the world - the blue sea

EXT SEA - DAY
THE BLUE SEA A BRILLIANT SUN BEATS DOWN
SOUND of thrashing in the water

In the distance we see a swimmer struggling to tow something
through the waves

As it comes closer we see that he’s towing a large piece of
flotsam - a ship’s beam Draped over it is the body of a man
who lies motionless He looks half dead

CLOSER

The swimmer frog-kicks Holding onto the beam with one hand
he forges through the water with the other The body of the
other man is slipping off the beam The swimmer grunts with
the effort of trying to push the man back onto it

The swimmer yells at the exhausted man trying to force his
limp fingers to grip onto the log

GLAUCUS
(groans )
So many miles I don’t want to die
at the end

Glaucus lets out an exhausted sigh and slips under the water
We RECOGNIZE the TATTOO on the man’s shoulder - an O inside a
circle

The swimmer hauls Glaucus back onto the beam Unconscious
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 14
The swimmer squints against the glare The SUN a fiery ball
high in the sky

ON HIS FACE as he scans the deserted ocean around him He
weighs it up Do or die

CUT TO

IT IS NOW STORMING

The swimmer tries with all his might just to stay afloat He
loses his grip on the beam It is swept away by the waves

The swimmer races after it grabs the beam and the limp man
on it

CUT TO

CALM WATERS

The swimmer wakes How long has he slept The man next to him
is livid Barely alive

In the sea below the swimmer he sees a SPARKLE LARGE FISH
reflect sunlight as they swim underneath

And then in the distance the swimmer sees an ISLAND

SWIMMER
You’re home Glaucus You’re home

The swimmer is ODYSSEUS erstwhile king of Ithaca

As he swims with the beam away from us we observe his leaden
arms fight the downward drag It’s an impossible distance In
his weakened state he absolutely must drown

EXT ITHACA - SEA SHORE - SUNRISE - THE NEXT DAY

SILENCE Water laps softly

ECU the Odysseus tatoo PULL BACK to reveal Odysseus prone
flat on his belly his cheek squashed into the sand beached

in the shallows

Odysseus stirs The eyes open His fingers embrace the sand
lovingly His own

ODYSSEUS
Ithaca
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 15

Odysseus pulls his aching body upright His long hair and
beard is matted his skin salt caked skin his lips cracked
lips His body is covered in fresh scrapes and gouges - all
speak of hardship a long and arduous journey

The BEAM is lodged into the sand No sign of Glaucus He
whips around his eyes scanning the sea He plunges back into
the water stirring up the shallows for any sign of his
friend

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
Glaucus Glaucus

But his friend is long gone

LATER

He staggers towards the cliffs that rise up from the beach
At the rock face his hands find TWO NAMES in childish
letters gouged into the chalky stone Odysseus and

Patrochlus He remembers

CLIMB WITH HIM His hands know these rocks well He wolfs
down some berries finds a BIRD’S EGG and slurps it down

LATER

Odysseus pulls himself over the top He’s breathing hard
exhausted from the climb He drags himself to his feet

This is the moment From this vantage point his land lies
before him He readies himself for it

Then he sees it - everything laid to waste He can’t believe
his eyes

IN THE FOREGROUND - the remains of a hamlet Barren fields
smashed walls burnt out cottages

He crosses through the dried ruts of a FALLOW FIELD

His feet kick up something smooth and grey He reaches down
to pick it up A human SKULL splinters in his hands

He drops to his knees and sweeps away the soil - more crushed
skulls broken long bones A baby’s skull He’s come upon a
family of skeletons

He HEARS the sound of hooves

He dives for cover inside the shell of one of the houses and
waits
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 16

A single rider a SOLDIER rides up to the WATER WELL next to
the house Dismounts UNLOCKS the cover to the well Waters
his horse while he takes a pee

He’s so close Odysseus can smell him He takes in the
strange garb the weaponry the taut physique the mask

The soldier pulls back his mask to reveal brutal features and
a blunt stump for a nose He bends over and dunks his head

Odysseus is eyeing the SWORD in the scabbard on the horse
He’s about to make a grab for it

The horses suddenly lifts its tail and farts loudly
SOLDIER
(shoving it away)

Hey

The soldier locks the well cover Then gets back on his
horse Trots away

Odysseus emerges from his hiding place He has no idea what
is going on But he’s parched

He rushes to the well and tries to break open the cover He’s
mad with thirst

Finds a rock and bashes the cover until it breaks
He gulps down the water

He looks around No sign of anybody

ANGLE ON THE ROOF OF A HUT on the top of far hill

He breaks into a run towards it crossing the expanse of
fields

He passes more burnt out farms A skeleton hangs from a tree
ANGLE ON MEN ON HORSEBACK patrolling the ridge

They see Odysseus out in the open

A CRY goes out

RIDER
Hey Who’s that Get him

Odysseus turns Sees them Changes course He aims for the
shelter of the surrounding hills

The horses thunder towards Odysseus
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 17

He’s running as fast as he can
He makes it to the wall of boulders He’s scrambling up them

One rider throws out a lasso that whips back in an arc the
tail coiling around his ankles in a vice-like grip He pulls
and Odysseus is YANKED hard onto the rocks His face SLAMS
onto the crags

The men vault off their horses Odysseus puts up a struggle -
but he’s unarmed against four men with swords and daggers
They overpower him and throw him to the ground

While they hog tie him and hoist him over a pole one of the
soldiers spies Odysseus’ TATTOO

SOLDIER
Look He’s a soldier from the army
of Odysseus

SOLDIER 2
I thought they were all dead

SOLDIER
(laughs)
He soon will be

They haul Odysseus away He lapses into unconsciousness

EXT THE VILLAGE - LATER

Odysseus tied onto the pole is carried through the main
thoroughfare of the village

WE EXPERIENCE THROUGH ODYSSEUS’ EYES

Starved and ragged villagers step back cowed as they stare
at the captive

MEN laboring under the whip of soldiers

A starving old man BEGGING for food is kicked out of the way
by a soldier

SOLDIER
Get up you lazy old bastard

His eyes follow a MAN (EMMEAUS) pushing a cart of butchered
hogs Emmeaus stops to stare at the captive

A soldier prods Emmeaus with his sword
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 18

SOLDIER (CONTD)
Move along

Odysseus recognizes Emmeaus but he does not recognize
Odysseus

They enter an encampment outside the village

They stop next to a CAGE with a man inside it

EXT COMPOUND - INSIDE THE CAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Odysseus his hands are chained together is thrown into the
cage with the other captive who groans and begs for water

Odysseus can SEE Archeas the gladiator who is sparring with
an imaginary opponent

The fisherman is delirious He mutters randomly at Odysseus

FISHERMAN

Who are you This is my house I’m
in my bedroom and this is where my
children sleep And this is where
my wife sleeps Get the fuck out of
my bedroom

(moans )
Water Give me some water you
bastards

A guard comes to the cage and pees into the cage The
fisherman tries to lap it up

Then the fisherman stumbles up to Odysseus He pokes the
tatoo on Odysseus’ shoulder

FISHERMAN (CONT’D)
But you all died in the war didn’t
you Gone All gone to the worms
(squints at him)
Are you Thanatos come to take me to
Hades

The guards poke pointed sticks through the bars of the cage
tormenting Odysseus Odysseus bears the blows silently

FISHERMAN (CONTD)
(wild staring eyes)
He is Thanatos messenger of death
Be wary friends or he will take
us all
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 19

The man collapses

CUT TO

LATER

The guards return They look in and see the fisherman lying
motionless

The one guard pokes the man with a stick No response

Then ANOTHER GUARD KASSIUS approaches He is a senior guard
and approaches with a JUNIOR

KASSIUS
(referring to Odysseus)
Is this him Show me

JUNIOR GUARD
Yes sir

The cage is opened and the JUNIOR GUARD walks up to Odysseus
Odysseus stares up at the man The Guard pulls on Odysseus’
arm

JUNIOR GUARD (CONT’D)
Get up

Odysseus doesn’t move So the guard tries to drag Odysseus
but can’t

JUNIOR GUARD (CONT’D)
Stubborn

He pulls on Odysseus again Odysseus won’t budge The guard
raises a whip which he brings down onto Odysseus back

JUNIOR GUARD (CONT’D)
Up

He whips and whips Odysseus doesn’t move

KASSIUS
(smile)
Stop No need to be brutal

Kassius enters the cage

KASSIUS (CONTD)
(sarcastic)
It’s only fitting that after such a
long journey I do you the courtesy
of coming to you
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 20

Kassius steps up to Odysseus and regards him carefully

KASSIUS (CONTD)
Hold up his arm

The guard holds up Odysseus’ arm The tatoo is revealed

KASSIUS (CONTD)
How many of the soldiers of
Odysseus are left

Odysseus is silent Kassius nods to the guard The guard
swings his arm and WHIPS Odysseus HARD

KASSIUS (CONTD)
Speak soldier

Kassius grabs Odysseus’ face Turns it roughly to him
Nothing The guard whips Odysseus while Kassius holds his
face Odysseus shows no pain Kassius smiles

The whipping continues throughout the scene

KASSIUS (CONTD)
Youre no soldier you’re just
another beggar Did you know the
coward Odysseus let all of his men
die Do you still want to be a part
of his army Beggar

Odysseus is now barely conscious

KASSIUS (CONTD)
He’s going to fight Archeas now

ON ARCHEAS the monster gladiator in the BG as he
practices swings his sword into a wooden beam THUD

The guards stare at the scrawny and bedraggled Odysseus - a
poor match for the monster man

GUARD 3
(grumbles)
He’s half dead That’s no sport

KASSIUS
It’ll be over fast

He gives Odysseus a hard kick The guards bring Odysseus
shakily to his feet They drag him out of the cage and chain
his ankles
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 21

KASSIUS (CONT’D)
(barks )
Lukas cut that fucking tattoo out
of the beggar’s arm Leave it ona
rock to bake

Two guards grip Odysseus pinning his arms One takes a KNIFE
and brings it to Odysseus bicep The BLADE penetrates
Odysseus’ skin

GUARD
(chuckle)
I haven’t seen a death match in a
while

ON ODYSSEUS He looks in terrible shape But his eyes are
casting about for an escape

In a split second Odysseus seizes the moment He pulls
himself free from the two guards

GUARD (CONTD)
Hey Get him

Odysseus can barely walk and the guards are young and fit So
they watch and laugh - he’s got no chance - and they lose
crucial seconds

In a flash Odysseus is scrambling up the hill It’s rocky
and steep He attacks it like a mountain goat He’s fighting
pain and exhaustion The ropes tying Odysseus’ ankles
loosen

His three pursuers are catching up on him The steep
unstable grade is giving way under Odysseus’ feet Rocks are
flying down the hill Odysseus heaves a BOULDER loose and
sets it in motion at the oncoming guards

The boulder roars down the hill The three guards scramble to
dodge its path

One guard is too late A boulder hits him square on the
forehead and he drops

Odysseus heaves more rocks at the others They fall back

Odysseus claws his way up to the top of the cliffs His chest
is heaving He drags himself up and moves on

LATER

Odysseus making his way through the bush He suddenly stops
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 22
Hears the SOUND of BOYS voices and the THWOCK THWOCK of
somebody throwing stones
Odysseus presses his face against the rocks and looks

THREE BOYS are pelting the DECAPITATED STATUE of ODYSSEUS
with rocks

Odysseus stares He is exhausted and depleted
The boys suddenly see this beggar and are shocked to silence
The oldest one we RECOGNIZE as PHEMIUS scoops up a rock and
hurls it at Odysseus who dodges out of the way The boys
scatter and scramble away
The youngest one is curious He lingers
BOYS (0C)
(yell)
You idiot Come away The soldiers

will kill us Come on

Suddenly a stone whistles through the air and hits him on the
cheek He screams

BOY
Ouch

He holds his bloody cheek as tears spring into his eyes

Odysseus’ hard stare shows no sympathy as he watches the boy
run to join the others

Odysseus takes in the vandalized statues His eyes burn with
anger

EXT ITHACA - EMMEAUS’ HUT - EVENING - LATER

POV SOMEONE WATCHING from a few yards away concealed
Emmeaus former servant of Odysseus is a bent man in his
sixties THROUGH THE DOOR we can see him tend a fire in the

hearth He nurses a painful hip

The watcher stumbles over the stony ground His body brushes
against some bushes We HEAR rasping breath

DROPS OF BLOOD drop on the dry ground and stain the earth

ON ODYSSEUS as he stumbles towards the hut
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 23

MOVE WITH ODYSSEUS as he tries to focus on the hut his
vision BLURRING

He drags himself into the open clearing

Emmeaus looks up to see the figure of a man swaying on his
feet He grabs a stick and approaches cautiously

Odysseus’ ankles start to crumple and he keels over slowly
dropping with a final thump onto the gravel

Emmeaus approaches the stranger warily Kneels down His eyes
travel over the bloodied and ragged figure The long curls
and matted beard

His eyes alight on the TATOO They widen with concern and
flick up and around vigilantly - checking if someone saw the
man

He quickly sets about dragging Odysseus by the ankles inside
the hut

Odysseus’ eyes are shut He looks half dead

Emmeaus pulls him into the hut and closes the door

EXT ITHACA - LATER

The one guard and Archeas have been joined by another guard
They huddle over the dead body of their comrade They’re
terrified Whispering

GUARD 2
(trembling)
How was I supposed to know he could
run like a fucking jack rabbit

GUARD 1
You better find him or you’re dead

on their horses

INT HUT - NIGHT - LATER

Odysseus lies prone on the floor like a corpse Emmeaus is
methodically cleaning his wounds His hand stops on the
tatoo He peers at it Then moves on Under the ribs he
finds a JAGGED SCAR This gives him pause His eyes travel
over Odysseus’ face A current of emotion - shock disbelief
then anger - jolts him He puts a lid on it Gets to work
feverishly

Emmeaus feeds a barely conscious Odysseus water
DISSOLVE TO

Under Emmeaus’ watchful gaze Odysseus sleeps deeply on a bed
of goat and sheep skins

EXT EMMEAUS HUT - A NEW DAY

Odysseus wakes up He jumps to his feet Adopts a defensive
position ready for anything

Then he sees Emmeaus sitting in the corner watching him
broodingly

EMMEAUS
Relax I couldn’t hurt a fly - even
if I wanted to Save your strength
for the others

He cocks his head towards the door

EMMEAUS (CONTD)
They’1l be back make no mistake
(Odysseus says nothing)
If I were you I’d swim back to
where I came from But we’ll have
to get that chain off you first or
youll sink

He chuckles to himself It’s a mirthless chuckle
DISSOLVE TO
FLAMES An iron prong glows red
EMMEAUS (CONTD)
(smiles)

They thought they’d destroyed all
my tools Idiots
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 25

Emmeaus uses the red hot prong to burn off the links of the
chain that ties Odysseus’ wrists together Odysseus grimaces
as the heat singes his skin

The chains drop to the ground

ODYSSEUS
Thanks

EMMEAUS
Don’t thank me Thank my master
Odysseus Even if he did leave us
in the lurch I still stand by him

ODYSSEUS
(directly)
Why

EMMEAUS
Only a fool would ask why

(he points at the tatoo)
There’s no place for one like you
here - not with that thing on your
arm It marks you for death

(a beat)

Eat You’ll need it For the swim
back

Emmeaus laughs at his joke Odysseus serves himself food and
eats hungrily He looks like he’s not listening But he is
Emmeaus is curious

ODYSSEUS
Maybe Odysseus didn’t ‘leave you in
the lurch’ Maybe he wanted to get
back but couldn’t

Emmeaus bursts out laughing

EMMEAUS
Then you are a fool No one could
stop Odysseus from doing what he
wanted

ODYSSEUS
So you don’t believe he’s dead

Emmeaus thinks for a long time His lids are heavy

EMMEAUS
I don’t believe he wanted to come
home He had more important things
Such as glory
(a sardonic smile)
(MORE )
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 26

EMMEAUS (CONTD)
But who am I a humble swineherd
to sit in judgment of the great
Odysseus

Odysseus bites down on the question he’s dying to ask

EMMEAUS (CONTD)

(throws him a titbit)
He had a wife

(Odysseus looks up)
But no one’s seen her for two
years No matter - I’m sure she’s
forgotten by Odysseus As for his
son - he sucks at the teats of the
invaders

ODYSSEUS
(appalled)
His son’s a traitor

EMMEAUS
What can we expect The boy was
abandoned by his own father and
Antoninus treats him like a son

Emmeaus lets this sink in

EMMEAUS (CONTD)
(a sly smile)
Have you had your fill sir

Is Emmeaus jerking his chain Emmeaus slyly indicates the
empty plate of food

Odysseus pushes the plate away He goes within himself
Tortured with guilt - and worry about Penelope

ODYSSEUS
Tell me Odysseus’ wife

Emmeaus sneaks a shrewd look at Odysseus

EMMEAUS
You speak of Penelope brother
The pearl of Ithaca More beautiful
than ever Indeed if Odysseus saw
her he’d fall in love with her all
over again

ODYSSEUS
(painfully)
Did she mourn his absence
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 27

EMMEAUS
Most grievously All joy was torn
from her

ODYSSEUS
(huskily)
Was she faithful to her husband

EMMEAUS
(ruminating)
Twenty years is a long time
Odysseus agonizes
EMMEAUS (CONTD)
She was faithful - to his memory -
before the invaders But after I
have no witnesses Perhaps
Antoninus charmed his way into her
heart Apparently he calls her his
queen
Odysseus suppresses a groan
EMMEAUS (CONTD)
So When are you leaving soldier

EXT ITHACA - SAME

A LONG SHOT of the two soldiers and Archeas coming upon the
three boys

Archeas places the point of his sword at the throat of
Phemius and asks if he’s seen a stranger

The smaller boy quickly speaks up Points towards the cliffs
where they’d seen Odysseus

The boys watch the soldiers ride away

Phemius cuffs the smaller boy on the side of the head

EXT CLIFFS - LATER

The soldiers are leading their horses looking at the ground
The one stops He sees tracks

He gets down on one knee and examines the bare footprints in
the sand

He communicates with SIGNS their tracking strategy

The three soldiers tether their horses and follow the tracks

EXT EMMEAUS’ HUT - LATER
Emmeaus looks up alert Did he hear something

He crosses lightly to the door and presses his ear against it
and listens We HEAR VOICES

Odysseus grabs the heated prong from the fire Emmeaus
gestures for him not to move

POUNDING ON THE DOOR
VOICE (0S)
Hey old man open up or we’ll break
it down
CLOSE ON EMMEAUS as he opens the door to find the two
soldiers and Archeas They look dangerous under their flaming

torches

They shove Emmeaus aside and barge their way into the hut

INT EMMEAUS HUT - MOMENTS LATER

NO SIGN OF ODYSSEUS

The leader’s eyes do a quick scan of the interior for
anything incriminating Sweeps stuff away using his long
sword Pokes at the fire

Then sees the empty plate of food

SOLDIER
What’s this

EMMEAUS
Food

The soldier bats him sideways to the floor He struts around
the small space noting everything

THE CHAIN

His eyes seize on it He becomes very still Unsheaths his
short stabbing sword The other two follow suit

They all turn on Emmeaus
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 29

SOLDIER
(to Archeas)
Take his head

Archeas grabs Emmeaus’ head and yanks it back exposing his
neck He raises his sword He’s about to behead Emmeaus

Odysseus air born from the rafters launches himself at
Archeas thudding into him with all his weight He sends the
massive gladiator flying onto the floor

In one quick movement Odysseus stabs Archeas and kills him

The two soldiers (one of them had tried to cut out Odysseus’
tattoo) stare in shock at Odysseus One charges his sword
straight out Odysseus hits the blade HARD with his hand the
sword vibrates out of the soldiers hand In one move
Odysseus uses the momentum of the charging soldier and
pushes him past Odysseus then picks up the sword and
thrusts it backwards right into the soldier who had now
turned back toward Odysseus The soldier SCREAMS Odysseus
pulls the blade from his stomach The soldier collapses to
the floor and is SCREAMING

The second soldier drops his sword and raises his arms in
surrender Odysseus brings his sword to the man’s throat

ODYSSEUS
Lower

The soldier gets down onto the ground

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
Lower

The soldier lies on the ground Odysseus has the blade to the
man’s throat

SOLDIER
Spare me

Odysseus slowly pushes the blade into the soldiers throat He
dies a gurgling death

Emmeaus rescued from the brink of death His face cannot
conceal his adoration

EMMEAUS
(with emotion)
Thank you brother

EMMEAUS
Of course not What do you take me

A roar of joy They bear hug holding onto each other
Emmeaus has tears streaming down his face

LATER

ODYSSEUS
Tell me everything

Emmeaus sits down and relates to Odysseus what happened when
the invaders came

EMMEAUS
They came at dawn with slashing
swords They showed no mercy Babes
and men were slaughtered alike

Odysseus listens intently with rising fury

LATER
THE TAIL END OF THE STORY

EMMEAUS (CONTD)
and that was the last time I saw
her my king

ODYSSEUS
My whole kingdom is devoured by
brutes I’ve lost my wife and son
By Zeus if I’d been here these
Barbarians would never have had the
gall to overrun my island
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 31

EMMEAUS
(gravely)
You did abandon your island That
is true
ODYSSEUS

(shoots back)
I was called to Troy I had to go
There was no choice in the matter

Emmeaus says nothing Makes no attempt to exonerate Odysseus

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
(a challenge)
You think it is too late That I
should go and never come back

EMMEAUS
(nodding soberly)
Maybe you should

ODYSSEUS
If I stay there will be blood

EMMEAUS
Your people will bleed rivers

ODYSSEUS
One man against forty

EMMEAUS
(fiercely)
One man who is worth thousands

Odysseus’ eyes flick up into Emmeaus’ eyes that eyes burn in
his wizened old face

EMMEAUS (CONTD)
(visceral)
Once a king always a king Come
let’s spread the news

ODYSSEUS
Not yet Let the invaders think
it’s some stranger who washed up on
their shores I will attack them by
stealth I will make them fear
their own shadows

POV A WATCHER Odysseus and Emmeaus drag the bodies to the
cliffs and throw them over

The bodies land in the tumultous seas

They watch the bodies bobbing in the water drawn by the
current

ODYSSEUS
The current will wash them around
the island

EMMEAUS
And onto the beach

ODYSSEUS
(smile)
For all to see Let this Antoninus
wonder and worry who the stranger
is
They HEAR a rustle behind them Odysseus whips around
THE WATCHER sees him and flees

Odysseus takes off after the figure that nimbly disappears
into the bush

RUN WITH THE WATCHER - deep puffing breaths as Odysseus gains
on him He comes to a hidden copse and dives into a crevice
in the rocks and starts climbing upwards

Odysseus appears at the copse and sees

THE THREE TETHERED HORSES belonging to the dead soldiers

Odysseus skids to a stop He realizes he’s been led here He
scans 360 degrees

A rock suddenly stings his cheek He lets out a bellow
A childish laugh answers

Odysseus looks up The boy Tiresius grins down at him
LAUGHTER from

Emmeaus who limps into the clearing laughing at Odysseus’
ignominy

He calls up to the boy
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 33

EMMEAUS
Well done boy The king will
reward you

ODYSSEUS
(quietly)
By ringing his neck

TIRESIUS

What king He looks like a smelly
old beggar

Odysseus takes a second look at the youngster

EMMEAUS
Beggar or king - what’s the
difference eh boy
(quietly to Odysseus)
His name’s Tiresius They killed
all his family He’s my eyes and
ears on the island

Tiresius appears in the clearing He and Odysseus regard each
other disdainfully

TIRESIUS
You look like shit

Emmeaus laughs

EMMEAUS
(sparkle in his eye to
Odysseus )
He reminds me of a boy I once knew
(tousles the boy’s head)
Now to the horses Good thinking
boy

Odysseus untethers the horses They each take one As he
hands the reins to Tiresius he gives him a hard look

ODYSSEUS
You’ve never seen me I’m not your
friend do you understand
Tiresius nods

Odysseus signals for them to follow him

They walk the horses away

The soldier with trembling hands opens the bag
THREE SEVERED MIDDLE FINGERS lie in the bag

Antoninus shows no emotion He plucks one up and holds it
between finger and thumb

ANTONINUS
Why this finger

He gives the finger as he says it He’s realizing something
Processing that he’s been sent a message fuck you

His eyes flick up to the terrified soldier
SOLDIER

He signs to his platoon They jump off their horses and grab
aman They string him up and hang him

There are screams and cries from the villagers

TELEMACHUS (CONTD)
This is what will happen to anybody
who helps the stranger

He waves at his men to move out

Why are you still doing Antoninus’s
dirty work for him

TELEMACHUS

PATROCHLUS
At least I can hold my head up

TELEMACHUS
Thanks to me you’ve still got one
Step aside Patrochlus Or you’1l

Emmeaus watches Odysseus quickly gather up a sword and a
dagger and then fasten the belt around him sheathing them

EMMEAUS
And now

ODYSSEUS
Motherfucker needs a length of rope
and the blood of a swine

Emmeaus asks no questions Hands him the rope Picks up a
bowl of blood lying underneath a butchered pig hanging from

Odysseus under cover stealthily bypasses a cluster of
houses Four bloody bodies are laid out Women are keening
over them

ON ODYSSEUS as watches the soldiers killing villagers in
twos They’re systematic and brutal

He betrays no emotion They keep on killing We’re wondering
if and when he’s going to act

The soldiers grab hold of the young boy who threw the stone
A tightening of Odysseus’ features betrays that he recognizes
the boy

Odysseus readies himself

MOVE WITH HIM as he picks up speed running down the slope
towards the group in the clearing

He breaks from the cover of the bushes and by sheer momentum
launches himself at the soldiers

They are startled to inaction by the bloody apparition

Quickly Odysseus approaches a soldier on the outside of the
rest - stabs him through the back Odysseus places his hand
over the soldiers face and pulls breaking his neck

The two other riders turns to Odysseus He stands before
them covered in their comrade’s blood Odysseus reaches for
the boy and drags him back to his parents

The soldiers are apprehensive

Get him you cowards

One solder takes a step forward and then the other rushes

Odysseus pulls the first man past him by the blade of the

Odysseus snaps his arm taking the sword and plunging it into
the man’s back pinning him to the ground

ODYSSEUS
Go look for mercy in Hades

Both soldiers writhe and groan in agony on the ground

Odysseus walks up to their horses He takes the reigns and
leads the horses to a couple of SHOCKED men in the watching
crowd

The leader is still on horseback watching Odysseus uncertain
of what to do He addresses the crowd

SOLDIER
If you stand by this man you will
all die Kill him

No one moves Like a tired lion Odysseus approaches the
soldiers screaming in agony

stop just short of them He watches unseen

POV TELEMACHUS Odysseus in action Within minutes he’s
despatched the soldiers It’s an amazing sight - this
ostensible ‘puny beggar’ battling these young fit fighters
From his practiced moves the man is clearly a seasoned
fighter

One by one he breaks their necks - under the shocked eyes of
the leader Their dying screams faded to an eerie SILENCE

ODYSSEUS
Aah much better

Then Odysseus gets up and approaches the leader His horse
fidgets uneasily Odysseus’ hands are raw from handling the
blade of the sword

LEADER
You have doomed this island to the
wrath of Antoninus

The gathered crowd looks to Odysseus for a response
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 41

ODYSSEUS

(raises his hands)
The wrath of Antoninus is but a
puppy compared to wrath of these
hands They thirst for your blood
Leave now before I rip your head
off of your shoulders and feed your
brains to the fishes If you doubt
me ask the Thebians how I tore out
their tongues at the root and hung
them on the tip of my spear to wag
at them as their souls seeped into
the sand

The leader’s eyes are wide with terror as he fearfully backs
his horse away

Telemachus jerks his horse’s head around and gallops away

ON ODYSSEUS attracted by the sound of hooves turns at the
crucial moment - just enough to see the departing horseman

But Odysseus has gone Patrochlus becomes suspicious Quietly
draws his sword and waits

Odysseus returns holding the two oars Patrochlus raises his

Patrochlus yells with fury and makes a dart towards Odysseus
with his sword But Odysseus - who is laughing - is too

in seconds has him disarmed his foot on his neck

When I was ten years old I went
hunting rock rabbits with my best
friend We were having such a good
time that we didn’t notice how late
it had got Before we knew it the
sun had set and it was pitch dark
I fell down the cliffs and broke my

He bends down and points at a bony bump on his shin
ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
A piece of bone was sticking out

right here

Patrochlus stares at this disbelievingly

My friend was a real jerk to me He
yelled at me to quit crying like a

his back in the dark He saved my
life The next day we made a vow
to be brothers We sliced our arms
here

He shows the scar on his wrist
ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
And mixed our blood together and

swore eternal allegiance

waiting for us A bitter battle
but we won the day

He is burned that is true

ODYSSEUS

of mine

Patrochlus looks at him enigmatically

PATROCHLUS
(wistfully)
I wish I had been by your side in
the war that you had not ordered
me to stay behind in Ithaca

ODYSSEUS

(smile softly)
Brother who else could be the

keeper of my sword

This draws a smile from Patrochlus

PATROCHLUS
Your sword awaits you lord

CUT TO

THE SWORD OF ITHACA stuck in a cairn of boulders The
crevices have been packed with pebbles and sand which have
formed a protective shell as hard as steel

Odysseus grips the handle to the hilt and pulls with all his
strength

The sword bends and creaks as if it might crack in half Loud
creaks and crunches as the casing starts to give Finally it
splits and the sword slides out

Odysseus wipes down the encrusted blade with his hand He
holds it in the air

ODYSSEUS
The sword of Ithaca lives

Odysseus grips Patrochlus by the shoulders and engages his
eyes

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
Loyal Patrochlus Thank you Now I
must gauge their strength and
decide if we can two can take them
on alone without allies

PATROCHLUS
There are only two allies we can
count on Memories are short lord
And most are like Medon They say
you abandoned us for glory

ODYSSEUS
What say you Patrochlus

PATROCHLUS
I will die for you my lord

says their name

ANTONINUS
We came upon a detachment of Trojan
youths at the crossing point of the

AFTERNOON - LATER

Telemachus and a platoon of soldiers searching for the

They come upon the ODYSSEUS SHRINE They burst inside A

worn leather amulet fallen off someone’s wrist He picks it
up Examines it MILITARY INSIGNIA

Emmeaus comes to his door His face is hard and unsmiling
when he sees it is Telemachus

TELEMACHUS
Where is he In the name of Zeus
tell me - before more blood is
spilled

Emmeaus’ gaze is unyieldingly critical

TELEMACHUS (CONT’D)
Don’t look at me like that
Emmeaus You think I’m a traitor
Judge me if you will but tell me
where the stranger is so I can end
the bloodshed

Emmeaus’ lips are a straight line

TELEMACHUS (CONTD)
Nothing happens on this island
without you knowing Tell me
Emmeaus before it’s too late I
want to save my people from more
suffering Do you hear me

Emmeaus starts to withdraw into his house slowly closing the
door

TELEMACHUS (CONTD)
If you’re helping him Emmeaus I
swear I won’t be able to protect
you any longer Don’t force my
hand

The crack quietly closes - infuriating Telemachus

TELEMACHUS (CONTD)
I spoke up when Antoninus was going
to kill you I saved your life
(viscerally)
You don’t walk in my shoes

fighting wars - as a king should

AGATHA

home from the wars why not him
Where was your Odysseus

Reading his doubt and uncertainty she lays it on

AGATHA (CONTD)

one left - except your great king

Now her turns on her

PATROCHLUS
Never speak like that in front of

him He abruptly grabs up his weapons and exits

She yells after him

AGATHA
May Zeus curse Odysseus and send
him back where he came from

FROM A HIDING PLACE Odysseus and Patrochlus watch the

PATROCHLUS
There are rumors lord

Odysseus looks at him knowingly
ODYSSEUS
Control your wife Patrochlus Her
mouth runs away with her

Patrochlus shrugs

Odysseus engages his eyes He has this way of seeing into
him It unnerves Patrochlus

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)

people’s demands

A LONG BEAT as Odysseus tries to read him

They part The one gets on his horse and rides away
We get a glimpse of the other’s face MEDON

Telemachus reining in his horse at the base of the hill He
jumps off and scrambles up the crags to the top

Telemachus arrives at the broken CAIRN where the sword of
Ithaca had been planted

He takes in the pile of rocks now strewn aside and the EMPTY
HOLE that had housed the sword

In the BG Tiresius sits in a corner wolfing down food

EMMEAUS

It’s a simple equation If you
leave the bloodshed ends If you
stay it continues You can’t argue
with it

(Odysseus does not

respond)
I fear the revenge you come back to
take will recoil on your head a
bitter deadly blow

ODYSSEUS

Emmeaus my house is plagued with a
swarm of enemies What king would
turn away from such an outrage

(pounds the table)
I will put my fighting strength to
proof in my own halls Emmeaus and
be master of my own house

A smile breaks through Emmeaus’ troubled visage

EMMEAUS
Spoken like a true king

MOMENTS LATER
Tiresius looks up
TIRESIUS

EXT A HOUSE - NIGHT

Under the cover of darkness - her face illuminated by a small
oil lamp Tyro speaks to Odysseus

PATROCHLUS
Tell my lord what you saw

Tyro is innocently and bravely beautiful She is patently
terrified when she speaks

TYRO
It was exactly three months ago to
the day I remember because it was
the feast of Athena I was sent to
clean the under passage I’d never
been there before I was scared It
was dark and quiet I heard
something A tapping sound I put
my ear to the wall Taptap taptap
I answered taptap taptap I heard
it again We went on back and forth
then I called out ‘who’s there’ No
one answered I thought I was
imagining it I was about to go
when I found this

She pauses overcome with fear and emotion Odysseus is
hanging on her words

ODYSSEUS
Speak up girl What did you find

She opens her fist A small braid made of purple threads
sits in her palm

TYRO
I don’t know if it means anything

Odysseus stares at it He knows this thing He picks it up
and handles it with the utmost care Emotion floods his face

Patrochlus jerks his head at her to exit

She slips swiftly away and merges with the darkness the pin
of light from her lamp moving away through the inky night

ODYSSEUS
Well get into the palace and find
her Then we kill Antoninus

PATROCHLUS
The guards
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 56

ODYSSEUS
Cut the head off a snake and the
body dies

Patrochlus thinks about this He shakes his head

PATROCHLUS
We’re outnumbered It’s impossible

ODYSSEUS
That’s what they said about Troy

LATER

PATROCHLUS
(awkwardly respectfully)
Lord it’s not my place but
tell me others came home from the
wars Those who survived found
their way back to Ithaca Those who
wanted to

ODYSSEUS
(a burdened look)
Did I not come back brother

The unspoken accusation hangs in the air

PATROCHLUS
You did lord

ODYSSEUS
One day I’1l tell you of all the
trials It’1ll take more hours than
we have now Let me promise you
this brother - in twenty years
not an hour went by when my heart
did not burn with longing for my

She struggles to get free from his grip He won’t let go He
pulls her face close up to his They’re nose to nose She’s
repulsed almost gagging with disgust

EXT ITHACA - AFTERNOON - LATER

TITHE DAY

A procession of CARTS loaded with produce rolls slowly up
the road to the palace

UP AHEAD the SENTRIES patrol the perimeter ramp inside the
wall

FIND AMONGST THE CARTS Patrochlus pushes a cart load of
butchered hogs

Alexis has a cart piled high with water melons

A group of laborers and serving girls reports for work FIND
LEODAMAS and ALEXIS amongst them

The procession halts at the GATE

The sentries step out to body search the men and get the
servant girls to show the contents of their baskets

The sentries turn this into vulgar sport

ON TYRO as a soldier body searches her She flinches
recoiling as he gropes between her legs and squeezes her
breasts He grips her chin and forces his tongue into her
mouth He laughs when she gags

THE CARTS One sentry drives his spear into the melons
spearing one on its tip He drops it and it pops open with a
sharp crack - like a skull - splashing blood red juice all
over the girls
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 58

A sentry decapitates one of the hogs and uses the hog head
act like a talking puppet - presses it’s snout against
Leodamas and ‘smooches’ him
The sentries find this hilarious
Eventually they wave them through

CUT TO
CLOSE ON PATROCHLUS as he pushes the cart into the palace
compound He’s in a state of high alert sweat beading on his
forehead

ANGLE ON TELEMACHUS appearing on the entrance steps

Patrochlus raises a nervous hand in greeting Telemachus nods
his head unsmiling

UNDER THE EYE OF THE SENTRIES
THE CARTS proceed around to the back of the palace
They roll to a stop at the back entrance

The serving girls file inside the palace The men gather at a
pile of rocks for breaking They are each handed a MALLET

Tyro exchanges a look with Leodamas who nods at her
Alexis and Patrochlus start unloading their consignments
PATROCHLUS
(to a palace guard)

We need help over here
The guard beckons to the stone breakers Leodamas primed and
ready immediately breaks away from the group and comes to
Patrochlus’ aid
They’re slinging a carcass over each shoulder

ANGLE ON ALEXIS and his cart of melons

CLOSE ON HIS HAND as he surreptitiously reaches down to the
WHEEL and removes the lynch pin

A CRASH as the cart collapses under the weigh of its load
spilling the melons all over the ground

ANGLE ON THE HOG CART

From under the pile of hogs Odysseus suddenly breaks to the
surface and hops out He grabs one of the hogs from Leodamas
and the two hurry side by side past the palace guards

MOVE WITH ODYSSEUS his face obscured by the hog carcase as
he enters the palace

CUT TO
Odysseus and Patrochlus drop the hogs onto the floor in the
larder Odysseus slips his hands inside the gutted carcase

and pulls out swords and knives

As they pretend to exit they split off and dart down a side
passage and hide

Guards walk by a hair from them
Odysseus signals to Patrochlus They set off again

Leodamas waiting outside nervously They’re ‘helping’ Alexis
fix his wheel - but they’re really delaying their exit

Odysseus runs down the hallway ducking into recesses to avoid
detection

ANGLE ON TYRO at the end of a hallway sweeping She sees
Odysseus and signals that it’s safe to come She immediately
hurries down some steps Odysseus quickly follows after her

MOVE WITH ODYSSEUS

Down the narrow winding stairs into an under ground passage -
an ancient granary and storage area

Tyro stops and point towards the end She’s not going any
further Odysseus nods at her

She flees back up the stairs with her broom

left turn into a small alcove where he waits for a second
then darts into a smaller side passage

A long beat of silence Odysseus is about to turn away
disheartened when we hear a TAPPING sound

Odysseus taps furiously in return

The tapping answers at the same tempo

Odysseus expels a relieved breath All his pent up pain and
fear dissipates He presses his cheek and hands against the

stone He whispers her name over and over again

along the open passage which runs above the large hallway
below They stop and peer over the edge of the balustrade A

As the girl said - Antoninus will
be alone with the seer

Odysseus waves Patrochlus forwards

He grips hold of the handle Opens it slowly

He turns around to signal to Patrochlus

But Patrochlus is not there Odysseus does a double take
Patrochlus is walking backwards away from him a terrible
look on his face

ODYSSEUS
Patrochlus Where are you going

Suddenly guards step out of the shadows on both side of the
passage way swords drawn

Odysseus whips around to see
The door of Antoninus’s chambers flung open to reveal Tyro
held fast and struggling by a guard He pulls her head back
and slits her throat Lets go of her and she crumples to the
floor in a pool of blood

Odysseus’ horse thunders up to Alexis who leaps onto the back

Odysseus gallops away from the palace

walks across the yard to the well

Pumps some water into the bucket

Walks over to the pig pen Opens the gate Pours the water
into the trough

He suddenly stiffens The point of a sword sticks into his
back He drops the bucket Raises his hands Slowly turns
around to see

Patrochlus is shocked like he’s seen a ghost

Odysseus throws him a sword Patrochlus catches it He stares
at it confounded

Besides I wanted you to know it
was me

Patrochlus blows up at him

Heed what I am saying Emmeaus
Every living thing There will be
nothing left of Ithaca but stones

Emmeaus turns slowly and gives him a withering look

EMMEAUS

TELEMACHUS
I do what he tells me to keep my

EMMEAUS
Or to spite the father who loves

horse tumbles head over heels throwing Telemachus off onto
the ground with a thud

Before he can spring to his feet his head is yanked back and
a dagger held to his throat

Telemachus stares into the face of Odysseus who holds him in
his lethal grip

ODYSSEUS
Know this son of mine that I
could have killed you had I wanted
to I choose to show you mercy

TELEMACHUS
Kill me I don’t give a shit You
can shove your mercy up your ass

Telemachus emits a furious growl and struggles free Odysseus
loosens his grip and lets go Telemachus dumps all his anger
onto Odysseus

Don’t you point a finger at me I’m
the one who’s trying to save this
island while you try to bury it
Why did you come back Don’t you
get it No one cares about the
great hero Odysseus anymore They
hate him Not half as much as I do

Odysseus throws his dagger and his sword on the ground And
offers his wrists and a length of rope

ODYSSEUS
You save your island then

Telemachus looks at him Then leans down and gathers up the
sword and dagger

TELEMACHUS
Odysseus never surrenders What

Odysseus walks behind Telemachus’ horse tethered by a rope
attached to Telemachus’ saddle

ODYSSEUS

That was an easy trick The way I
caught you back there Child’s
play

We did that to a whole army once
Ten thousand Persians brought to
heel with some rope

Telemachus says nothing - but he’s listening

Do you know where I got the idea
for the Trojan horse Right here on
the island When I was a boy we hid
under some sacks in a cart inside
that orchard

something to show you

Odysseus follows Antoninus through the phalanx of soldiers

surrounding him

INT ODYSSEUS’ PALACE - GREAT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Odysseus looks around the large room In the center

gladiator’s ring has been set up

FLAMING TORCHES illuminate the room

a large
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 71

Overhead is a grand CANOPY (like a tabernacle) held in place
by thick ropes at four corners Secured to rings embedded in
the stone floor

ANTONINUS
Your son has been a great comfort
He’s kept the peace Until you came
along and spoiled it all You
shouldve stayed with that woman
What was her name Calypso

ANGLE ON PENELOPE is ushered into the light Her regal
bearing undiminished by her captivity Her ankles are
shackled

ANTONINUS (CONTD)
So my queen Tell us is this
withered old beggar your dead
husband Your son believes he is

She stares at Odysseus Her eyes travel over him
disdainfully

PENELOPE
You insult me to suggest I would
share my bed with this puny old
goat He’s disgusting My husband
was a real man

ANTONINUS
(amused)
Look again It’s been twenty years

She walks in a circle around Odysseus looking at him

PENELOPE
(sensually)
Odysseus’ eyes burnt mine when he
looked at me See this hand My
husband’s veins stood out blue as
rivers

CLOSE ON HER as she sees the SCAR under his rib Their eyes
meet for a second But hers quickly move on

Her finger traces a line down his back

PENELOPE (CONT’D)
(touching his skin)

Between the shoulder blades he had

a birth mark in the shape of

Ithaca And here I once bit him

too hard - a game we were playing

in the tunnel
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 72

Antoninus who is turned on by this talk

PENELOPE (CONT’D)
You think I don’t know my own
husband whose every inch of flesh I
mapped out with my tongue The
stupid beggar has fooled all of
you Throw him back in the sea
where he came from

ANTONINUS
Seems like your wife has forgotten
you captain Sorry

PENELOPE
If you think my eyes deceive me
let your sword be the judge
Antoninus Go on Smite the
impostor

Antoninus smiles He likes this game He removes his sword
from its sheath He nods at one of his guards They hand over
a sword to Odysseus

Odysseus stands ready

ANTONINUS
I won’t sully my sword with a
beggar’s blood My lieutenant can
do the honors

He turns to Telemachus and throws him his sword Telemachus
catches it

PENELOPE
Yes kill the beggar

Antoninus is unnerved by her reaction He hesitates for a
second

PENELOPE (CONT’D)
Go on

Alcinous falls at Antoninus’ feet

ALCINOUS
Antoninus no If he is Odysseus
you invite the vilest anger of the
gods to set a son against a father

ANTONINUS
(kicks him away)
I’m not afraid of any gods old
man
(MORE )
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 73

ANTONINUS (CONTD)
I’ve already been to hell - in the
Trojan bonfires Odysseus watched
us burn Crackle crackle crackle
Squealing like pigs we were
(campy sarcastic)
Oh those Trojans

Telemachus intervenes
TELEMACHUS
(barks )
I’m ready

Odysseus and Antoninus glare at each other

ANTONINUS
Swords out

The signal for Odysseus and Telemachus to raise their swords
touch the tips and launch into the fight

THEY FIGHT It’s a terrifying fight Telemachus is on top
form - lithe and fit Odysseus although slower on his feet
a formidable swordsman

Antoninus watches from Odysseus’ throne He’s loving this

Telemachus and Odysseus hurl epithets at each other as they
fight

TELEMACHUS
You abandoned your people

ODYSSEUS
I fought the Trojans and won

TELEMACHUS
You don’t deserve to be king

ODYSSEUS
You don’t deserve to be my son

The soldiers are going wild They’re excited that Odysseus’
strength is flagging

Telemachus is chasing Odysseus out of the ring The fight is
spreading all around the room

Telemachus seems to be controlling the fight They’re both
swinging wildly

Telemachus forces the fight to the door Odysseus has his
back to it
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 74
Odysseus takes a deep lunge and seems to drive his sword into
Telemachus’ side Telemachus falls on one knee
A LOUD ROAR of excitement
ALL
(chanting)
Kill him Kill him Kill him

Suddenly Odysseus reaches out with his sword and chops at
the ropes securing the huge canopy

The canopy falls down on top of the flaming torches which
catch fire with a whoosh - enveloping the room in flames

PANDEMONIUM - SCREAMS SMOKE

Telemachus springs to his feet Now we see the plan They’re
in it together

ODYSSEUS
Lock the doors

Telemachus races to the doors and clamps them shut
The men flee for the doors but can’t get out Odysseus and
Telemachus lay into them with their swords chopping them to

pieces

ON ANTONINUS as he realizes what’s happening He grabs
Penelope and bolts

Odysseus sees But he can’t get to her

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
Penelope

The flames are too high - the conflagration forming a barrier
between them

ON TELEMACHUS as a soldier comes from behind and stabs him in
the side He drops to the floor

Odysseus despatches the soldier
Odysseus is appalled at the sight of his wounded son

TELEMACHUS
Father Leave me Go

THROUGH THE SMOKE AND FLAMES we see figures falling around
us
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 75
Odysseus heaves Telemachus over his shoulder supporting his
weight

MOVE WITH ODYSSEUS stumbling under the weight of Telemachus
who is holding his bleeding side

The fire and smoke follows them down a warren of passages

Odysseus is coughing as he dislodges a square of rock that
reveals the hidden tunnel

He scrambles into the tunnel Replaces the rock
He carries his son through the darkness

CUT TO

EXT ITHACA - SOME ROCKS - MOMENTS LATER

Odysseus emerges from the secret tunnel where it opens out of
the hill

He lays Telemachus gently down onto his back Telemachus is
breathing stertorously His tunic soaked with blood

Odysseus holds his sons’ head up trying to help him breathe

ODYSSEUS
We nearly did it I’m sorry Your
mother

TELEMACHUS

(a whisper)
Her love is undimmed Go get him
father

Telemachus weakly raises his wrist showing Odysseus the
amulet he’d found at the temple - the one belonging to
Odysseus

ODYSSEUS
Ill be back

TELEMACHUS
I waited twenty years What’s
another hour

The emotion breaks through

ODYSSEUS
What a son
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 76

INT CAVE - LATER
Odysseus arrives at the cave
A VOICE calls out of the gloom

VOICE (0C)
Father

Phemius appears looking terrified

ODYSSEUS
It’s me Odysseus

PHEMIUS
Where’s my father

Odysseus grips his shoulder and engages his eyes

ODYSSEUS
You need to be strong

Tears spring up in Phemius’ eyes He breaks down crying
PHEMIUS
I hate them Give me a sword I’1l
kill them all
Odysseus smiles at the boy’s bravery
ODYSSEUS
In the name of Zeus revenge will

be sweet

They quickly set about gathering up the CACHE of weapons
hidden in the cave

CUT TO

EXT ODYSSEUS’ PALACE - LATER

Antoninus stands before his remaining soldiers They’re on
horseback their horses skittish from the smell of blood and
smoke

ANTONINUS
(to Alcinous )
What of the storm

ALCINOUS
Not yet master
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 77

ANTONINUS
If the storm won’t come to
Antoninus Antoninus will come to
the storm

He laughs Then raises his hands to the soldiers
ANTONINUS (CONTD)
(yells)
Odysseus will be the king of
nothing No prisoners

A LOUD ROAR raises up from their throats The soldiers take
off at a gallop

PIGS SQUEAL

EXT ITHACA - LATER

As the soldiers plunge into a herd of pigs and chop them to
pieces

BLEATING

As the soldiers drive a herd of SHEEP over the edge of the
cliffs into the sea

SCREAMS

As the soldiers pull every living soul from their homes and
slaughter them

SMOKE AND FLAMES as the soldiers torch the houses and lands

PAN TO ODYSSEUS and Emmeaus with Alexis and the two boys
Phemius and Tiresius They observe the carnage

EMMEAUS
What now great king

ODYSSEUS
To the river

EMMEAUS
What for To drown ourselves Maybe
a good idea

ODYSSEUS
(to Emmeaus pointing)
Build a fire Up there For all to
see

They all stare at him Confounded Mistrustful
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 78

EMMEAUS
A fire What for

ODYSSEUS

When you are near make it look

like you’re far away
(to Alexis)

Get the heads How many do we have

ALEXIS

My runner will deliver it He can

run like a hare

Tiresius smiles proudly

EXT THE RIVER —- LATER

Odysseus digs a trench at the base of the hill leading down
to the river He’s using his sword and dagger Anything he
has The river sand is soft and it comes away easily It’s
deep enough trench to snap a horse’s legs - and a man’s

He covers the trench with branches

He strings the rope across the path

THE HILL ON THE OTHER SIDE
A fire blazes like a beacon

Silhouetted against it the HEADS

Odysseus sends Tiresius on his way

ODYSSEUS
Go

Tiresius takes off up the hill
CUT TO

At the river Odysseus waits under cover holding one end of
the rope Tied to a tree on other end

We hear the horses hooves approaching as they thunder down
the hill

ON THE ROPE as the hooves approach

Sweat beads all over Odysseus He’s holding the rope to the
last second

CUT TO
In amongst the riders

THEIR POV Silhouetted against the fire on the hill HEADS
are moving back and forth

Blood lust excites the riders all the more

CUT TO
Odysseus as the hooves bear down on him
He raises up the rope tripping the horsemen

CHAOS as the whinnying horses go flying tossing their riders
off their backs and into the trench

The riders scramble to recover their weapons - but are set
upon by Odysseus He plunges into the fray chopping the
unarmed men to pieces

CUT TO

THE TOP OF THE HILL

Alexis and Phemius waving their fake platoon (wooden heads on
sticks) cheer as they witness the carnage below

Tiresius does a triumphant jig

THE SOUND OF HOOVES makes them turn around
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 80
To their horror three riders are storming up the hill from
behind
The two drop their sticks and run for their lives

Phemius is chased down by a mounted soldier He fights back
bravely

Another rider joins in Now he’s fighting two He’s
hopelessly overwhelmed The soldiers run him through one
after another

Phemius drops to the ground dead

CUT TO

Tiresius running as fast as he can down the hill back to
Odysseus

The third rider sees him Pulls away from the group and takes
off after him

RUN WITH TIRESIUS Breathing hard the eight-year old tears
down the hill

ANGLE ON ODYSSEUS seeing this

ODYSSEUS
Tiresius

Tiresius looks behind him Terrified he sees the rider
coming after him

Odysseus running towards him his sword raised and ready
trying to intercept the rider

Tiresius is just ten feet away

The rider catches up with him raises his sword

Odysseus launches himself at the horseman He swings his

sword wildly unseating the rider He stands over the fallen

soldier stabbing and stabbing at him

Odysseus is covered in blood He looks wild and crazy

Tiresius is staring at him in shock

Odysseus picks him up Holds him in his arms with relief
ODYSSEUS (CONTD)

Brave lad One more thing for your
king
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 81
PULL BACK as Odysseus gives him instructions The boy takes
off running away through the hills

ODYSSEUS (CONTD)
Antoninus

PULL UP AND OUT on this as the CALL ECHOES over the island
WIDER LOOKING DOWN ON THE ISLAND

As the remaining soldiers down to their last men decimate
the population

CUT TO

A BABY mewing in the grass Blood smeared Dropped beside
his dead mother - Agatha Patrochlus’ wife

CUT TO

EXT ODYSSEUS’ PALACE - LATER - EVENING
A deathly silence

The gate is wide open The gatekeeper lies dead in his own
blood

ON ODYSSEUS standing in the gate way

Inside the compound an eerie stillness No one is about
It’s like a ghost town

Smoke still burns from the blackened RAFTERS of the MAIN
HALL

Odysseus stands ready with his sword He repeats his call to
arms

ODYSSEUS
(a bellow)

Antoninu-uuuus
His voice echoes
Suddenly HOOVES invade the silence spooking us
A crazed riderless horse clatters into the compound He’s
got blood on his flanks his eyes rolling with terror his
sides heaving He stands in place stamping his hooves

Beached Rudderless

He’s Antoninus’ horse
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 82

MOVE WITH ODYSSEUS as he enters the palace
UP THE STEPS INTO THE MAIN HALL

The burnt out main hall - where the canopy ignited - charred
bodies are littered about in grotesque death poses

FEET swing slowly into his eye line He dodges his head to
avoid them We recognize the soft slippers of

Alcinous the seer He’s hanging from a HOOK
Odysseus touches the foot lightly
ODYSSEUS (CONTD)
(huskily)
Brave Alcinous

TRACK ALONG THE PASSAGES

Odysseus wields his sword ready for an attack He makes his
way defensively his eyes scanning from side to side

Down the stairs to the under passage

Along the narrow passage to the large WOODEN DOOR which is
OPEN

He steels himself with dread He goes in

Gloom

A SLANT OF LIGHT from a narrow rectangular slot cut out of
the rock illuminates

A bed A candle A stool An ankle shackle opened

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
You bastard

On the floor the PURPLE shawl He drops down picking it up
Holds the shawl to his face Breathing in the smell of her

He’s maddened with anger

CUT TO

HIGHEST POINT OF THE PALACE

Odysseus’s eyes search the empty landscape under the
reddening sky
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 83

ODYSSEUS
(urgently to himself)
Zeus where is she

A rush of wings and a PELICAN launches itself from the roof
and flies slowly over the island

ODYSSEUS POV

On the sky line A figure tied to a pole Like a sentinel
Even from here we can see it’s a WOMAN her skirt flapping
in the breeze

Odysseus is horrified to the core His worst fear

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
No No

Odysseus running down the steps of the palace
CUT TO

Odysseus grabs the horse by its halter and swings himself
onto its back

He digs his heels in and gallops out of the compound

EXT ITHACA - CONTINUOUS
Odysseus urges the horse towards the figure
He passes some villagers slaughtered They call out to him

VILLAGERS
Help us Help us

Odysseus yanks in the reins pulling the horse to an about
turn

But the FIGURE on the hill pulls his eyes He can’t stop
He kicks the horse’s flanks and takes off ignoring their
cries

CUT TO

Odysseus closing in on the figure He slows the horse to a
trot

He can’t bear to go closer He gets off the horse and
approaches with trepidation His breath is shallow his heart
racing
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 84
ODYSSEUS
Penelope
She is backlit by the setting sun We can’t make out her
features Her head is slumped onto her chest Her body limp -
supported in the standing position by the ropes securing her

to the pole

Odysseus reaches her He slowly walks around her fearing
what he might see Clearly she is dead

He lifts her head up

It’s not Penelope It’s a young girl Her neck slit from ear
to ear

Odysseus gasps and let’s her head slump back onto her chest
He whips around Realizing he’s been led into a trap
Then he sees

A moving figure running down the path to the sandy inlet
below It is Antoninus

The sound of a horse approaching Odysseus braces himself
It is Alexis

ALEXIS
Lord there are women and children
sheltering in the temple The
soldiers are burning them out
Come I beg of you

ODYSSEUS
(bellows )
Antoninu-uuuuus
ALEXIS
The people lord What of the

people
But Odysseus is already half way down the hill
CUT TO
ANTONINUS is dragging Patrochlus’ boat out of the sea grass
He looks up

POV ANTONINUS Odysseus hurtling down the winding path to the
beach
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 85

Antoninus unhurriedly drags the boat into the shallows

CUT TO
Odysseus bursts onto the beach He races towards Antoninus
Antoninus has one foot in the boat about to launch it
Odysseus plunges into the water

ODYSSEUS
Where is she

ANTONINUS
Gone to Hades to be ravished by all
the men you slaughtered

Antoninus grabs an oar and swings it at Odysseus’ head
batting him sideways into the water

Odysseus’ sword falls into the sea

Odysseus surfaces and grabs onto the side of the boat
Antoninus hammers at his hands with the oar

Antoninus overbalances the boat starts rocking and turns
over throwing Antoninus into the water

A fight to the death in the sea as the two men with water at
waist height wrestle with each other with their bare hands

They’re half drowning and strangling each other A wave
breaks over them and washes them onto the sand

Their swords and daggers churn about in the sand They
scramble to retrieve them

Now they’re chopping and stabbing each other Odysseus dives
for Antoninus and plunges his dagger into Antoninus’ chest

He rips off his mask

Odysseus is shocked by the disfigured monster he sees
Antoninus’ face has been burned off - he’s a blackened skull
with shiny puckered skin

Antoninus lies back cackling a ghastly ghoulish laugh

ANTONINUS (CONTD)
Do you remember me now captain
The platoon from Pylos You sent us
back to fetch the brave king’s
breastplate Our lives were
expendable not his

(MORE )
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 86

ANTONINUS (CONTD)

No we could burn

(a beat)
Feast your eyes on what you took
from me captain Remember me in
your dreams - that I took all from
the hero Odysseus - his wife his
son his island

Odysseus drops next to him shaking him

ODYSSEUS
(holds the dagger)
Where is she Ill peel you like a
fig

ANTONINUS
(gagging and laughing)
Hail the king of Ithaca The king
of nothing

ODYSSEUS
Hear this Antoninus You dog You
never imagined I’d return from
Troy You bled my house to death
ravished my serving women abused
my wife No fear of the gods who
rule the sky no fear that men’s
revenge might arrive someday Now
your doom is sealed May the
vultures eat your corpse

Blood is spurting out of Antoninus’ mouth
Odysseus grabs his sword and plants it into the sand
ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)

Better the king of nothing than

king without honor
Antoninus chokes in his blood and dies
Odysseus staggers to his feet He’s bloody and exhausted He
wades into the sea Dunks his head in the waves and washes
all the blood off himself

He pulls up his sword and makes for the cliffs

As he looks up he sees someone standing on the lip of the
cliffs

A woman

He breaks into a run
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 87

EXT ITHACA - LATER - SUNSET

Penelope and Odysseus They stare Taking in everything They
banter with each other

ODYSSEUS
Puny old goat Thanks

She smiles

PENELOPE
‘Puny’ was a bit over the top I
guess

ODYSSEUS

Odysseus has no birthmark on his
back But I know someone else

He walks around her Pulls the top of her dress gently down
her back to reveal a birth mark

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
who does

She turns to him They’re up close

PENELOPE
I never bit him on his arm I bit
him

They both touch the same spot next to his nipple

ODYSSEUS
Here

He holds onto her hand Kisses the fingers

PENELOPE
I always feared someone might come
to Ithaca and beguile me and
pretend to be Odysseus I had to be
sure

ODYSSEUS
You are the craftiest of women

PENELOPE
I had a good teacher

They drink in the sight of each other

EXT ITHACA - LATER

Against the backdrop of pockets of flames lighting up the
night the survivors gather

Telemachus his bloodied chest wound bound with cloths
leans on his mother’s arm

Emmeaus bends over the body of Phemius whom he has laid out
on a slab and is anointing with burial oils The mortal
wound an oozing gash Tiresius is helping to bind the wound

Odysseus surveys the attrition all around

ODYSSEUS
What price freedom

EMMEAUS
Priceless my lord

Odysseus looks at him skeptically

EMMEAUS (CONTD)

When the faces of our buried dead
plague your dreams and their cries
disturb your sleep remember this
it is the duty and the burden of a
king to despatch evil no matter
what the cost in blood or land or
kin

(all encompassing gesture)
Their blood will nourish the seeds
of freedom

Alexis appears out of the darkness with two of Antoninus’
soldiers he’s taken captive The men are bloody and beaten

ALEXIS
When they heard Antoninus was dead
they had no fight left in them

ODYSSEUS
If you cut the head off the
snake
Alexis nods
ALEXIS

Ill finish them off

Odysseus holds up his hand
ODYSSEUS11FIRST ROUGH DRAFTAEPFEB1809 89

ODYSSEUS
Put away your sword Our quarrel is
ended We will shed no more blood

He picks up his sword and holds it out to Telemachus

ODYSSEUS (CONT’D)
Telemachus To whom I give the
sword of Ithaca Take it It’s
yours

ON TELEMACHUS as we pull away from the scene

BOYS VOICE (VO)
Odysseus was true to his word He
never picked up his sword again
Peace and prosperity came to
Ithaca the flocks and herds
replenished He had a dream that he
would die peacefully And he did
in his old age

My father Telemachus told me the
story of my grandfather the hero
Odysseus
