What happened

Someone probably hit him with their
car He came too close to town

They walk away into the woods

EXT FOREST PARK ENCAMPMENT - AFTERNOON 4

They arrive at a spot where they toss down their packs
They’re home Will lights a lantern which emits a low light

He pulls back some large branches which they’ve used to
obscure their dwelling constructed with a tent and tarps
In front of it they’ve set up a small cooking area A
camping stove is perched on a flat rock and two tree stump
stools are arranged around a small table fashioned from a
board

Will stashes their groceries in a buried food cooling cache
Tom lights a lamp

He processes wood - splitting it with his knife

Tom feathers the tinder sticks

Will ignites the tinder with the ferro rod

They sit together and eat their soup

Will is reading Tom arranges her sleeping bag

WILL
Need a second layer

TOM
I’m fine

She gets in and comfortable He turns out the light

TOM (CONTD)
See you in the am

They make their private clicking communication sound

After a moment they hear the sound of snapping branches as
some dogs run through the brush and through their camp One
dog stops to sniff around their tent Will switches on a
flashlight and they can see the outline of its snout
protruding through the shelter wall Will reaches for a pan
and bangs it with a spoon which sends the dog away

TOM (CONT’D)
I named the head dog Layla

WILL
If she’s such a good friend of
yours you could tell her that
were trying to get some sleep
around here

TOM
I don’t speak dog

Will smiles

WILL
Let’s try to get back to sleep

He settles in attempting to fall asleep again but is wide
awake
EXT FOREST PARK ENCAMPMENT - DAY 6

Tom walks along a fallen tree to a small garden covered by a
transparent plastic tarp She pulls back the tarp and weeds

As she works she gets distracted by pill bugs and centipedes
under a log She uses a magnifier to look closely at the
centipede With the knife on her belt she cuts deeper into
the log and reveals more bugs

EXT FOREST PARK - DAY 7

Tom forages in the forest for edible plants She uses a small
pair of field glasses to identify a bird she hears

She pokes around a fallen tree and discovers the yellow tip
of a chanterelle mushroom hidden underneath

TOM
Yes

She investigates further and finds a small patch of the
mushrooms and begins snapping them off at the base In the
distance she can hear her father make a a bird sound

Tom answers him with an owl sound

She gathers the mushrooms puts them in the pocket of her
hoodie and heads back to camp

EXT FOREST PARK ENCAMPMENT - DAY 8

She cuts through some low brush to get to Will He’s
immersed in building a solar cooker using the scrap metal
they collected as a base

TOM
Look what I found

He glances up to look at the mushrooms but he’s absorbed in
what he’s constructing

WILL
Excellent Good haul Give me a
hand here

She holds pieces of foil while Will tacks them in place over
the frame of an umbrella

She looks at the book he’s using to learn about solar
cooking

TOM
Do you think we’ll ever be able to
cook on this It seems better for a
sunny state

WILL
There’s radiant energy even when
you can’t see the sun

TOM
Maybe so but I couldn’t wait 2
weeks for an egg
He’s in thought about improvements

TOM (CONTD)
This’1ll be good in summer

TOM (CONTD)
I’m hungry Can we finish this

later
WILL
Yes
He smiles at her
EXT FOREST PARK ENCAMPMENT - DAY 9

Will in his city clothes conservative neutral colored
garments combs his beard He clicks to get her attention

TOM
Code Brown

After a moment Tom comes from behind the privacy tarp
dressed in her clothes for town She washes her hands

WILL
Clean your nails

He passes her a sharpened stick She notices a long pine
needle in his clothing and picks it off

He tidies up their dwell space and she coves the lids of
cache buckets

They check each others’ clothing and do one last preening

EXT FOREST PARK - DAY 10

Tom and Will walk parallel to each other through the trees
At one point Will stops crouches down and looks back from

WILL
Weve been this way one time too
many New route needed

They continue on

TOM
It’s only Tuesday Why are we going
to town today

WILL
Schedules and routines are fine
but you don’t want to be
predictable That’s when you get
hit by being overconfident

growing
TOM

I’m growing

WILL

Al3

She smiles at him

EXT FOREST PARK PUBLIC PATH - DAY 11

streets Tom and Will exit using one of the public paths and
stairs looking like any other folk leaving the park Tom
spots a necklace on the ground She picks it up looks at it
and puts it back on the ground

One of the men living in the camp LARRY a vet who knows
Will from the VA greets them Larry opens the package of
pill bottles tearing off the warning labels that are affixed
to the bottles and the suicide literature that the VA packs
in every bundle Two of the bottles are smaller than the
others

LARRY
They’ve changed the cocktail again

Larry checks the label on the small bottles

LARRY (CONT’D)

Less Roxi’s less bars Figures
they’re cuttin’ back on the ones
that have any value to us

He checks the big bottles

LARRY (CONT’D)
Looks like someone’s tryin’ to
unload the sleep meds -- Seroquel
it really has no value to me Id
have to find someone who wants to
sleep all day and gain 70 pounds
(rifling through the bag)
Prazosin - when’s the last time
that stopped a nightmare They
must be gettin’ a deal on these

Will nods Larry takes all the bottles and pays Will

WILL
They’re harder to get

7A

LARRY
First they give ‘em out like
candy and now they’re yankin’ the
leash back

Will makes a small parting gesture
LARRY (CONT’D)
Whatever they’re givin’ you I’ll
take ‘em off your hands
He looks over at Tom
WILL
Let’s go
EXT FOREST PARK - DAY 20

Tom and Will walk away from the men’s camp up a curving path
into the trees

TOM
It’s weird going there

WILL
If you’re going to say something
be specific

TOM
It makes me feel sad to be there

WILL
That makes sense

TOM
Then why do we go

WILL

We don’t need the meds but we can
use the money

EXT FOREST PARK ENCAMPMENT - DAY 21

Will clears the air shaft for the dakota pit He maintains
the water catchment system

EXT FOREST PARK - DAY 22

camp and closer to the public hiking paths In the trees she
can see the orange vests of an inmate WORK CREW AN OFFICER
walks back and forth supervising Tom spies from behind the
trees She moves closer staying in the shadows

The worker closest to sees Tom through the branches and
stares They lock eyes for a minute

Tom steps back and hurries away

EXT FOREST PARK ENCAMPMENT - DAY 23
Will’s working on a fire but the dampness makes it hard to
start Tom chops the mushrooms She’s hungry and the fire is
taking a long time

WILL
This is all so wet

TOM
Can we use the propane

WILL
Heard your stomach growl

He nods that propane is the way to go in this instance

She turns on the propane camp stove and the mushrooms cook
quickly She gives Will one to taste They enjoy

Will now hears the sound of the power tools from the work
crew in the distance

TOM
I saw them earlier it’s OK it’s a
work crew They’re way down by the
pathways

WILL
Drill

She pops the last of the mushroom into her mouth He shuts
down the stove moving quickly fueled by adrenalin
EXT FOREST PARK FERN GROVE - DAY 24
He hustles Tom along to their emergency hiding area Will
watches her hide in the foliage of a large fern He checks
from all angles to see if she’s truly covered but she’s
slightly visible
WILL
The pattern of the face is the
first thing someone can recognize

She pulls herself deeper into the fern

TOM
Dad I know how to do this

Her hiding is not precise enough

WILL
Then be good at it

He covers himself in the foliage in a way that makes him
imperceptible
EXT FOREST PARK HIDING SPOT - DAY 25

Tom relaxes in her hiding spot which she uses as a look-out
She’s reading the section on sea horses in the encyclopedia

From below the sound of cracking sticks can be heard and
soon the huffing and puffing of a man An off-trail RUNNER
comes into the clearing He stops and puts his hands on his
knees spitting on the ground

As Tom scoots farther back on the hiding spot to be out of
his sight she knocks a book off The runner doesn’t see the
book fall but hears it and turns around craning his neck to
see if he can spot someone Tom contracts into a small ball

RUNNER
Hello Somebody up there

He steps back a few paces trying to see more catching a
glimpse of her

RUNNER (CONTD)
Hello

Tom holds her breath She remains utterly still waiting until
she can hear him resume his run and leave the area

She peers over the edge to confirm that he’s gone

EXT FOREST PARK HIDING SPOT - DAY 26

Tom back on the ground moves quietly in the direction where
the runner took off to check that he’s no longer in sight

It hits her that an outsider has seen her She sits for a
moment to collect herself

At the base of the log she’s sitting on she finds an odd
looking mushroom which she picks and heads home

EXT FOREST PARK ENCAMPMENT - DAY 27

As Tom approaches their camp she finds Will looking at the
Forest Park map She sits near him still shaken from the
runner encounter When he looks up she hands him the weird
mushroom to examine

Tom looks through the Wild Edible Mushroom Guide and tries to
match it to one of the photos

TOM
Fairy ring mushroom --no
ink cap hexagonal-pored polypore
common puffball Avenging Angel

She stops on the next page and double checks the mushroom
against the photo

TOM (CONTD)
I think I found it The Prince

WILL
Double check that it has no deadly-
poisonous lookalikes

TOM
I did

WILL
Check again

Tom sketches the mushroom in her mushroom and fungi
and writes the number 21 on it

TOM
We’re up to 21

A lot of people think it looks
dangerous to move the pawn in front
of the King but as long as you
Castle it will be safe fora
while

It’s Tom’s move They both hear unfamiliar distant sounds
Will listens intently detecting the muffled sounds of a
walkie-talkie Will and Tom look at each other knowing this
is not a drill The sound gets louder As Tom starts to sweep
the chess pieces back in their box Will grabs her arm and
they run through the trees

Will hears one of the book crates topple over followed by a
dish crashing

WILL (CONTD)

Jean leads Tom to sit down on a log Tom keeps her eyes on
her dad as the officer turns him around so Jean can talk
privately to her

dream board Valerie is upset

TIFFANY
Howd it go

VALERIE
So they couldn’t find a placement
for me in that district so I won’t
be able to go to the school I
wanted to

TIFFANY
What’d Jean say

VALERIE
She was like “I’m really sorry I
tried really hard and blah blah
blah”

Valerie looks down Tiffany gives her a sympathetic look

VALERIE (CONTD)
She says I’m too high risk to place
and nobody wants a kid that’s my
age

Tiffany tries to divert Valerie’s attention She passes
Valerie an image that she thinks she’1ll like for her board

Valerie looks at the dream boards and experiences a wave of
frustratoin and disgust She sweeps the boards and magazines
off the table

VALERIE (CONTD)
This is bullshit

Tiffany and Tom watch as Valerie crosses the room and grabs a
stuffed teddy bear She sits back down at the table and pulls
a needle out of the bear She starts poking her finger with
the needle

TOM
So what are you gonna do

VALERIE
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
okay If I knew what I was gonna do
this wouldn’t be such a big deal

Tiffany shoots Tom a look Valerie anticipates Tom’s question
and stops her from asking more

VALERIE (CONT’D)
No one is coming to get me
29-29AB

Tiffany is concerned that Valerie is hurting herself

TIFFANY
Did you sterilize that

VALERIE
Of course I sterilized it No one’s
used it since the last time I used

it
TIFFANY

VALERIE

Yes
TOM

My dad says it’s important that if

out to prevent an infection from
spreading

VALERIE
Your dad knows everything

thing for her
Tense silence
WILL
Don’t let the little light go out
in her

Jean and James exchange a look jot a note

your well being

I liked your notes about mushrooms

TOM
That doesn’t make it okay
JEAN

found a place outside the city
where you and your dad can stay
until we can get you into permanent
housing I’11 be checking in with
you regularly to see how you guys
are doing

She cuts to the chase

JEAN (CONTD)
What do you think about going to a
regular school

Let me ask you this What would you
do if you had a hundred sheep and
one of them wandered off Wouldn’t
you leave the ninety-nine on the
hillside and go look for the one
that had wandered away I’m sure
that finding him would make you
happier than having the ninety-nine
that never wandered off That’s how
it is with the almighty your
Father in heaven He doesn’t want
any of his sheep to stray from the

He turns to face her
WILL

Some people get comfort from church

Sunday people believe certain
things about us

Like what

WILL
That we’re more like them and that
they understand us And then they
don’t ask too many questions

TOM
Why’d you shake hands with people

WILL
It’s the custom

TOM
But maybe you could make a friend
with someone there

WILL
Could be but Church is not the
first place to find a friend

TOM
I feel like I could make a real
friend at 4-H

WILL
What about on the other side of the

Larry shakes his head no good

LARRY
They’re patrolling everywhere
There’s no place they don’t look
for you

The bull dozer sound escalates with the crushing of Larry’s
belongings Will and Tom look at what Larry is watching the
dozer shoves his structure down

LARRY (CONT’D)

Let me see it

He looks at her hand roots through his bag and pulls out a
band-aid

He wraps it around her finger

The sound of wheels squeaking on the neighboring track is
piercing Their car hasn’t moved yet

Why’re we doing this

WILL
To save our money for food

The yard is quiet for a moment Exhausted they wait A
freight goes by on the upper track A cop siren and bull

of clothes Will does the same

My feet are stinging too

under his shirt to warm them up

They put on the dry socks Will wraps plastic bags around her
feet She struggles to get her boots back on

They look around trying to get their bearings as to what
direction to choose but it all looks the same

TOM
Do you see any power lines
The’d lead us somewhere Wouldn’t

He hands the last of their water to her She takes a few sips
and passes the bottle back to him

WILL (CONT’D)
You need it It’s important to
drink Finish the rest
She takes a few more sips

In the distance they see that the power lines just keep
going and won’t lead them anywhere

TOM
Dad my legs are stiff

She looks to him for help
TOM (CONT’D)

Not to this exact place

The fact that he had no specific location hits her hard
TOM
There’s no cabin

105 EXT FOREST - DAY 105
Will sets down his pack Adrenaline is coursing through He
looks behind them and into the void ahead trying to decide
how to gamble

TOM
I can’t feel my feet

He follows his gut about which choice gives them a better
chance of surviving

WILL
Collect branches

Tom so stiff that she can only move slowly collects
branches and boughs Will drags over a large fallen branch

Will props one end of the branch against a stump creating a
spine for a structure He then starts leaning branches and
sticks against the spine

WILL (CONTD)
Keep adding to this

He drags another bough from a fallen tree breaking off
pieces with his foot He shows Tom how to layer the boughs
over the sticks to create the debris shelter He cuts sword
fern branches with his knife and gives them to Tom to layer
on

WILL (CONTD)
Line the bottom We can’t let the
moisture reach us

She’s adding pine needles He tosses her some cedar She
doesn’t take it

WILL (CONTD)
Use cedar for that

TOM
What does it matter

WILL
It matters Cedar keeps back the
moisture

She stops moving He wraps her in a mylar rescue blanket
that’s been in his pack since the park days

They change into dry pants adding whatever layers they can
He starts to stuff debris into his coat -- his sleeves his
hat He puts some in her hat and passes a bundle for the
inside of her coat

Will gathers moss and squeezes it tightly to get some drops
of water Squeezing it takes all his strength He drips
water into Tom’s mouth

opening with boughs and sticks

the flames

He takes out the three cans of soup in the kitchen cabinet
and heats one up

Tom can see that he’s limping a little Will draws the
curtains and lights a few candles

They sit at the table eating the soup While Will looks at a
map Tom puts her hand over the flame until it’s too hot to
keep there Will gets up to check the map that’s on the wall

Will nods

WILL
(tracing route with his finger)
Cut across this ridge here and if
not hitch from the road

TOM
I wish we could just stay here for
a while

WILL

We need provisions

TOM
This is kind of perfect

appreciating the remote cosy tranquility

TOM (CONT’D)
Maybe we can build ourselves a
place like this

WILL
Need to own a little land

TOM
What about a small house that’s in
a tree We wouldn’t need land for
that We’d just need one tree

Will smiles at the rare moment when he is amused by her kid
logic He keeps the optimistic planning going

WILL
In the Spring we can find a place
where nobody will bother us

Will double checks the cabinets to see if they’ve missed any
food supply He reaches to the back of a cabinet turning up
only condiments

TOM
Do you miss the things we had back
at the farm

WILL
Those were never really our things
INT CABIN - NIGHT

Will looks over and sees that Tom has already fallen asleep
He finally looks relieved He sits on the chair across from

Sleep tight Yellow

He blows out the candle

INT CABIN - MORNING

She draws a big mushroom on the list He smiles

Tom brings over a wool sweater for Will to layer

Tom gives him a hug
TOM (CONTD)
Dad you’re sure I shouldn’t come
with you

He puts the socks in his pocket

under his
socks

WILL
No it’s important for you to let
your feet recover

TOM
What about yours

WILL
They’re fine

TOM
But you’re still limping

WILL
Bad blister can do that

She looks at him wondering if he’s leveling with her

Tom cooks the second half of the can of soup She cleans her

blistered toes wrapping them in gauze She puts on two pairs
of socks and her shoes

She ties a rope to a small metal pot on one end and a
colorful patterned table cloth on the other

EXT FOREST CABIN - DAY 118

Tom surveys the land around the cabin trying to see which
direction Will might be coming from She decides on a tree
that stands alone from the others and attempts to throw the
metal pot over a branch so it will catch the tablecloth in
the tree After two attempts the object flies high enough
for the cloth to get snagged in the tree

She stands back wondering how far away the colorful waving
fabric can be seen She shifts from foot to foot trying to
keep warm Branches creak the wind stirs no sign of Will

She heads back to the cabin

INT CABIN - DAY 119

With no soup left Tom stands on the counter and looks into
the very back of the highest cabinet shelves to see if they
might have missed something She finds nothing edible

She opens the lower cabinets On her hands and knees she
almost crawls inside From the way back she pulls out a box
of pancake mix There’s only a little in the box and she
taps out every drop and adds water When she pours it into
the skillet it makes one large pancake

She eats the pancake slowly

INT CABIN - DAY 120
Tom stuffs her clothes into her pack

She walks over to a pile of Will’s belongings things he’d
removed from his pack when he set off across the ridge

She is hesitant to touch an envelope that is filled with
documents but peers in decides it is important

From the things he left behind she takes the pouch of
documents his notebook a well worn map of Forest Park

When she looks again inside the pouch she finds a snap shot
of Will her mother and herself as a baby There’s another

photo of a soldier in a hospital one of a soldier in dress

uniform and a newspaper article

She finds a couple of her drawings along with poems and
passages that he’s torn out from books and folded into his
sketch book She opens a folded page taken from the Iliad

TOM

(reading the page)
Achilles went on grieving for his
friend whom he could not banish
from his mind Sleep refused to
visit him He tossed to one side
and the other thinking always of
his lossAs memories crowded in
on him the warm tears poured down
his cheeks

She finds a little plastic capsule with some small teeth
inside A folded paper has been inserted with the teeth

TOM (CONTD)

Tom’s baby teeth
She looks at the objects holding back tears

Tom lights every candle in the cabin

EXT FOREST CABIN - NIGHT 121

On the front railing of the porch she drips wax and lines

of the candle flames

bundles back up putting on layers

EXT FOREST ACCIDENT SITE - DAY 123

Tom walks deep into the woods looking for tracks
Periodically she stops to listen for sounds

In the distance she hears an engine sound and quickens her
pace in that direction As she nears the edge of a ravine a
spot of color catches her eye She sees her father at the
bottom She scrambles down the ravine to where he lies

TOM
Dad

No answer She swallows hard

TOM (CONTD)
Dad

She runs over to him and shakes him gently He’s slightly
responsive not fully conscious but still breathing She
runs her fingers across his forehead which is scraped and
smeared with dried blood

TOM (CONTD)
Oh Dad

She puts her hands on his face trying to warm him

She hears the engines again but they stop before she can
figure out what direction they’re coming from

TOM (CONTD)
Someone’s in these woods I heard
engines before

Tom opens her pack and layers the remaining garments over her
father She puts water to his lips She stows the water
bottle inside his sweater She opens her father’s pack and
sees that he had gotten their provisions

She holds her father tight

TOM (CONT’D)
I’m getting us some help

Will nods She walks away backing up afraid to turn her
back on him

Tom turns to concentrate on where she should be heading but
she finally breaks down She leans against a tree wiping
stinging tears from her chapped cheeks

She doesn’t know which way to walk She turns 360 waiting
for the sound again

The engines resume she moves as fast as she can She can
hear human voices music and the engines

EXT FOREST ATV SITE - DAY 124

This is from the bees from right
here When you can walk I wanna
show you

Will manages to lift his leg a little After a second he
puts it down

TOM (CONTD)
It’ll take a little while Dad

Will sighs His mind races ahead

WILL
What have you told these folks
about us

TOM
Not a lot They haven’t asked me
much

WILL

What have they asked you

TOM
Dale asked me if we’re in trouble
I said no We’re not right

Will uses his arms to try again to lift his leg

WILL

Do you think they called anyone

TOM
Called who

WILL

People who will try to move us

somewhere

TOM

I don’t think they’d do that here

WILL
What makes you say that

TOM
It’s a feeling I get

Sitting on the edge of her father’s bed she lifts the honey
jar off the window sill and adds a spoonful to her tea She

dips the spoon again and turns to Will

TOM (CONTD)
Want to try it

WILL
Yes

She drizzles a long strand of honey into his cup

who she senses won’t use it against them

TOM
He wants to leave

Blane nods understanding He runs his hand over Hector’s

head and brings him closer

BLANE
This is Hector He’s helped me a
lot

BLANE (CONTD)
You wanna take him for a couple of

days

so Blane can hug him He lets Hector jump back to all fours

BLANE (CONT’D)
I think your dad might like having
him around Let him sleep in your
dad’s room

want to stay

She shows Dale the money in her hand Dale pushes the money
back to Tom

DALE
You’re welcome to stay down there

So is this enough

breath You can stay

Tom leans into the trunk to get another grocery bag Dale is
stuffing some of the cans she bought into a canvas bag When
the bag is full she ties it shut and rolls it into a forest
patterned tarp

TOM (CONT’D)
What’s that for

comfortable she is The bees cover Tom’s arm like a long

Tom approaches the RV humming a line from the song at the
shindig She joins her dad Tom puts her arms around him
Together they are 50 agony 50 hope

few items of clothing are on the bed along with the map and
some food

He finishes rolling a blanket
TOM (CONTD)
It won’t heal right I don’t want
to leave

Last time you almost died-

He raises his eyes to look at her
TOM (CONTD)
And you would have if I hadn’t
found you

He looks down thinking

WILL
It won’t happen to us again

She wants him to understand she tries again

TOM
The people here aren’t very
different from us Don’t you see
that

WILL
Yes They’ve been very good to us
but we need to go back to our own
way of life

TOM
Why can’t you stay

Will shuts his eyes wishing he had words for it He packs
food Tom is frustrated She watches him pack the few last
things

Well find a good spot

Will passes Tom some of the bread he packed He’s brought her
jar of honey with the label that she’s decorated She takes
the jar but doesn’t open it Will reaches for the jar and
drizzles some honey on the bread

She looks out into the expanse of woods She knows why her
dad loves being in the forest

A gust of wind rustles the branches A wild hare forages
unafraid The trees sway He stands up ready to continue the
search for their new place

He starts to walk Fighting heavy resistance Tom follows her
father She lags behind him He looks back at her Tom is
distant and upset wildlife image He slows down until she
catches up The leaves rustle loudly She looks at him

TOM (CONTD)
Dad -

In the silence it becomes clear what she’s about to say

WILL
Can you find your way back

TOM
Yes

Will’s eyes well up

TOM (CONT’D)
You taught me

him They stand in arm’s reach neither able to make the

until her dad becomes small in the distance When she can no
