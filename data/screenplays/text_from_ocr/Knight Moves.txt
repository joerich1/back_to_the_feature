INT AUDITORIUM - 1972 - DAY

TWO BOYS sit on opposite sides of a chessboard One is NINE
the other FOURTEEN The room is SILENT the tension between
the two young players severe All the ADULT PLAYERS that have
been eliminated from this match by the two boys stand around
watching On the wall is a BANNER that reads 1972 WASHINGTON
STATE TOURNAMENT

The FOURTEEN year old moves and hits his TIMER Frustration
fills the NINE year olds face He moves The FOURTEEN year
old moves and calls CHECK The NINE year old frantically
searches the board for a solution He moves Again the
FOURTEEN year old moves and calls CHECK The NINE year is
stunned He picks up his KING to lay it on its side and
signal defeat Suddenly he rakes the pieces off the board
grabs his fountain pen and lunges at the FOURTEEN year old
stabbing him repeatedly in the chest They fall to the floor
The ADULTS try to pull them apart The NINE year old struggles
ferociously SCREAMING and kicking like a mad man

INT HOSPITAL WARD - 1972 - DUSK

In the bg we see the Nine year old Boy sleeping A DOCTOR
and the boys FATHER a hard-looking MAN in his forties walk
through the door We MOVE with them down the hall

DOCTOR
The pressures and demands players with
your sons abilities put on themselves
to win are incredible The stress and
tension are difficult enough for adults
to handle yet alone a nine year old

FATHER
I cant afford to keep him in here
forever you know

DOCTOR
Id just like to keep him here over
night then start sessions with a child
psychologist

FATHER
I knew this would happen This is his
mothers doing Shes not strict
enough with him I work all day She
lays in bed drunk and the boy does
whatever he wants

DOCTOR
After hes released its crucial that
hes supervised The most important
thing is that during his treatment hes
not allowed anywhere near a chessboard

EXT HOUSE BACKYARD - 1972 - DUSK
A small tract home The Boy sits on the ground drawing in
the dirt with a stick He does not notice as his Father walks

up and stands behind him

her wrist and pools on the floor The CAMERA moves up the arm
A WOMAN in her forties lays in bed The blood flows from her
other wrist soaking into the mattress Her eyes are closed
head titled away from him

The Boy shows no sign of emotion He walks over to the
nightstand and starts to open her purse There is a MOAN from
the WOMAN as she opens her eyes and turns her head toward the
boy They lock eyes for a moment then slowly her eyes close
The boy removes a key from the purse and walks to a dresser

He unlocks a drawer and removes a box then leaves the room

handsome man in his early thirties Well-dressed in an
expensive suit there is an air of confidence about him Peter
makes a move then hits the timer Peters opponent
GRANDMASTER LUTZ a quirky-looking little man in his fifties
makes a tentative move

JEREMY EDMONDS Peters trainer a distinguished-looking man in
his fifties watches from his WHEELCHAIR He grins and nods
his head knowing that Peter has got the game

Lutz studies the board makes a move then hits his timer

side signaling defeat Peter stands shakes his hand waves to
the crowd then leaves the stage

Yurilivich who is only two games behind
Sanderson in this match

INT POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
Frank and Andy stand before several UNIFORMED OFFICERS

FRANK

First of all Id like to say that a
lot of us havent got to know each
other since I replaced Captain Waters
last month A lot of you think that
Im an outsider who came over and took
away a job that should have gone to a
local but thats the way it worked
out So all I can say is tough shit
You want to bitch about it thats fine
-- but you will tow the line in my
department That means the next time
an Officer is responding to a homicide
call he seals off the crime scene and
nobody -- nobody but but Detective
Wagner and I go in

(Beat)
Also if anyone talks about the message
on the wall or the blood Ill
personally cut their balls off with a
butter knife

(to Andy)
Get em going - then meet me at the

together

because she took a bath

FRANK

FRANK
You mean no prints but hers

PETER
She called to give me my schedule for
tomorrow

FRANK

Whats interesting about it is you say

says on her message for you to call her
at home and she doesnt leave a number
That would imply you already knew the
number

PETER
I got it from the tournament directory

Frank takes out a small book

chess I dont have the patience for
it When did you start playing

PETER
When I was very young

KATHY
It seems like such a complicated game

PETER
Not really You see your goal and you
go after it Anything that gets in the
way is an obstacle and must be
destroyed

Sounds very violent

Chess is a reflection of life Life is
violent The strong win The weak
perish

polite conversation What shall we

fatal mistake in chess

You

PETER
Each circumstance requires a different
tactic

each other The moment is broken as the PHONE RINGS LOUDLY
Peters head snaps towards the phone

FRANK
Remember try to keep him on as long as
you can Dont confront him Let him
answer the questions I gave you

The Technician starts his tape machine and tracing equipment
Peter picks up his CORDLESS PHONE

PETER
Hello

We HEAR the CALLERS distorted VOICE

CALLER (OS)
Hello Peter

PETER
(stalling)
Just a second
(a beat then)
Hello

CALLER (OS)
Very amateurish Peter Im surprised
you would use such an obvious tactic
(there is anger in his

voice)
Im not an idiot Dont treat me as
one Ill call you everyday You get

one minute whether you put me on hold
or talk is up to you Are you ready to
play

PETER
Yes Why did you kill Debi Rutlege

CALLER (OS)
To get your attention

PETER
Did you know her

CALLER (OS)
No only the path she chose to travel

Peter is trying to keep the conversation moving

PETER
And -- what path is that
CALLER (OS)
We all have paths to follow You hope
yours will lead you to me

PETER
Why did you write remember on the wall

CALLER (OS)
Thats something youll have to figure
out for yourself Really Peter you
cant expect me to answer such direct
questions

PETER
Why not

CALLER (OS)
You dont want to think and thats why
Ill win Im already two points
ahead

PETER
What

CALLER (OS)
I did another one last night You
might have saved her but you didnt
want to play

PETER
Where is she

CALLER (OS)
Youll find her

PETER
If you got something to say to me just
come out and say it

Andy picks up the extension phone

Theres a

Frank angrily motions Andy to get off

ANDY
Where is she you sonofabitch

chuckle from the Caller

CALLER (OS)
Ah Detective Wagner Im sorry but
youll have to get off the line and go
back to your tracing equipment If I
wanted to play the game with a moron I
would have called you

Andy hangs up

CALLER (OS)
I suppose you want to know where Im
going to kill tonight Peter

PETER
Youre not going to tell me that

CALLER (OS)
Wee Willie Winkie runs through the
town Upstairs and downstairs in his
nightgown Crawling through the
window At the end of Miss Emmas
street Her God has gone and left his
home So her and I can meet

The line goes dead A beat Everyone reflects on what they
have just heard

FRANK
(to Andy)
Are you out of your fuckin mind
picking up the phone

ANDY
Sorry
FRANK
(to Technician)
Anything
TECHNICIAN

Nothing Wed have a better chance if
we could tap in at the junction box

FRANK
Thanks Mister Sanderson
(to Kathy and Andy)

Lets go

PETER
You want me to go with you Maybe I
can help

FRANK
Thats alright Well take it from
here

EXT HOTEL GROUNDS - MORNING

Kathy Frank and Andy leave Peters room and walk back towards
the hotel

ANDY
You should be an actor Frank You
looked like you were really mad The
veins popping out on your neck was a
really nice touch

KATHY
You werent mad at him for picking up
the phone

FRANK
No I told him to I wanted to make
sure there was someone on the other
end

KATHY
But we heard him

FRANK
It could have been a tape A
prerecorded conversation between
Sanderson and himself

INT POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

A room set up to deal with the murder PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned
to a cork board Frank is at a table with Kathy Andy and
Nolan On the chalkboard in the rhyme the Caller recited
earlier

ANDY
The FBI has nothing remotely similar
to this guy I think hes a first-
timer

FRANK
Check with the State If hes never
killed outside of Washington the FBI
wouldnt have it Nolan

NOLAN
He tapes their mouths shut We found
traces of adhesive around the victims
mouths Were doing a chemical
analysis for components but its
probably a standard brand you can buy
in any hardware store

FRANK
Theres only two hardware stores on the
whole Island Well check that out
What about the blood

NOLAN
Not a drop Maybe the guy works for
the Red Cross
Frank looks at Nolan askance

FRANK
Kathy

KATHY
Well the fact that he views this as a
game suggests that he is trying to
prove some sense of superiority -- and
the way he murders confirms a need to
be in complete control of his victim

FRANK
What about the way he arranged the
body

KATHY
That would indicate hes playing out a
fantasy Power-control killers usually
fantasize about their actions long
before they commit them Once they
become a reality though they reach a
sense of euphoria and need to repeat
the act to sustain it But in all the
research Ive read on Serial Killers
Ive never heard of one moving so fast
Its as if the game is the catalyst for
the murders -- not the other way
around

FRANK
Anything else

KATHY
Yes Why disguise your voice if no one
knows it

FRANK
I was thinking the same thing He must
be local Its logical for him to
assume that the police would be there
but he recognized Andys voice and
called him by name

(points to the rhyme)

What about this

KATHY
I would think its some type of clue as
to where hes going to kill next

ANDY
Why does he call Sanderson

KATHY

Hes one of the best Chess players in
the world Who better to play a game
with

FRANK
(to Andy)
You still having a problem with this

ANDY
Yeah I am I think hes playing us
If I was a killer and the police were
trying to make a case against me what
better why to draw them off than to put
their attention on someone else

KATHY
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the
mail is one thing -- but who called him
today
ANDY

I dont know Maybe theres two of
them Maybe he hired some Wino to make
the calls

KATHY
Maybe youre reaching a bit I think
Sanderson should be in on this
Theres a reason why the killers
calling him

A UNIFORMED OFFICER KNOCKS and enters

EXT WAREHOUSE - WIDE SHOT - AFTERNOON
Several BLACK and WHITE UNITS are parked in the rear of the

ridiculous hat with sheets of aluminium foil sticking out

(LUTZ
Theyre trying to control my thoughts
(points to the hat)
Aluminium foil It repels the thought
rays

Peter stares at him In the bg Kathy enters looks around
then walks over to Peter

KATHY
They couldnt break the riddle

PETER
Did you think it was going to be easy
You think he was going to lay it out at
your feet

KATHY
We need your help

PETER
I offered my help this morning and
Sedman turned me down

KATHY
But youre the key The one he wants
to play the game with

PETER
I cant right now Ive got a game

KATHY
She could be dead after the game

PETER
She could be dead now

KATHY

What if she isnt Where are your
priorities You have to think between
someones life and a chess game
(raising her voice)

The girl he killed last night was only
twenty one years old He dumped her
body behind a warehouse like a sack of
garbage

Everyone is now staring at Kathy and Peter who are staring at

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Peter sits across from GRANDMASTER KRIKORIAN He makes a move
then hits his timer On the BOARD behind him the move is
duplicated Krikorian studies the board Peter is staring out
over the AUDIENCE deep in thought Krikorian makes a move and
hits the timer Peter continues to stare unaware that it is
his move A beat All eyes are on him

Peter turns around and stares at the big board then walks over
and makes a move Krikorian studies his position Peter
reaches into his pocket for a cigarette He removes the
envelope Kathy gave him then his cigarettes A beat He
stares at the envelope flicking his finger against it
Krikorian looks up annoyed Peter opens the envelope

CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS We see several PHOTOGRAPHS of Christie
Eastman before her death Peter turns through them Next we
see the grisly PHOTOS taken at the crime scene He is a man
struggling to make a decision Krikorian makes a move Peter
does not react He replaces the PHOTOS and stares at the
envelope then looks up at Krikorian who is watching him A
beat Peter replaces the envelope in his pocket then makes a
move

INT POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

SO HER AND I CAN MEET

Her God has gone and left his home

Everyone shakes there head indicating they dont understand the
reference

KATHY
Why these girls How does he pick
them

Frank points to a LARGE MAP of the CITY on the wall with TWO
RED PINS in different locations

FRANK
(pointing to the map)
I dont think it matters Last nights
victim Christie Eastman was found ina
warehouse on the outskirts of town
The night before Debi Rutlege was
found in the center

KATHY
Meaning

ANDY
Meaning it looks like his victims are
chosen at random

PETER (OS)
No

Peter is standing in the doorway He enters the room

ANDY
What do you mean no

PETER
He says its a game All games have a
strategy

ANDY

All you gotta do is look at the map

PETER
His victims arent random It only
means that they appear to be random
Theres a connection we just have to
find it

Peter turns his attention to the blackboard
PETER

What have you come up with on the
riddle
FRANK
Wee Willie Winkie runs though the
street We think he might be making a
reference to himself

PETER
Maybe but I dont think so I think
its just a tease

FRANK
Upstairs and downstairs in his night
gown -- He could be saying the house

hes picked is two stories

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT - KILLERS POV

As he approaches a TWO STORY house The POV stops moving as
if to decide which way to go then goes around the right side
of the house

breaks We see two GLOVED HANDS open the window

INT POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Peter has taken his jacket off and is pacing the room Kathy
Frank and Andy stare at the board

PETER
Thats it

FRANK
We think he might be making a reference
to drugs Miss Emma is a street term
used by junkies for Morphine

PETER
Could Emma be the name of the girl hes
going to kill
ANDY
Weve checked Theres no one with the
last name of Emma on the Island

FRANK
Maybe hes going to drug her

KATHY
Hes killed both girls exactly the same
way Its almost ritualistic Why
would he change now

PETER
Morpheus
ANDY
What
PETER
Not what -- who Morpheus The Greek

God of dreams Look at the next line
Her God has gone and left his home

His home would be Mount Olympus

KATHY
You sound like my mother

PETER
It wasnt intentional

KATHY
Does whats going on bother you at all
Or are you just wearing your game face

PETER
I think its interesting

KATHY
Another kind of game

PETER
In a way

KATHY
This isnt a game

PETER
Oh but it is Hes killing a person
everyday and challenging us to catch
him Thats a game It has rules and
objectives

KATHY
How can you look at it so clinically

PETER
Take your average cop They deal with
death everyday If they let emotions
get in the way it would cloud their
judgement

KATHY
Thats true -- but the emotion is still
there They just learn to control it

PETER
What about you Arent there times
when a young child is telling you a
story so sad you just want to cry

KATHY
Of course

PETER
Do you

KATHY

(uncomfortable)

Lets change the subject

PETER
Okay So tell me about yourself Are
you married

Kathy stops

KATHY
How did we get to that subject

PETER
Im just curious

KATHY
(uncomfortable)
I think its best if we dont ask too
many personal questions -- I want to

keep things on a professional level

PETER
You mean like in the steam room

KATHY
Thats not fair

PETER
Are you going to tell me you didnt
feel something in there

Kathy is growing more uncomfortable by the moment

KATHY
Youre projecting your own desires and
reading more into what happened than
what actually did

PETER
Very good Spoken like a true
psychologist When confronted with the
prospect of your own reality hide
behind quotations What is that
Masters and Johnson

The tension breaks Kathy smiles

KATHY
You have to win every point dont you

PETER
I just wanted to know if youre
involved with anyone
(Beat)
Let me ask you something Do your
colleagues know if youre involved or
not

KATHY
Of course

PETER
Why

KATHY

Because I work with them

PETER
Arent you working with me

Kathy smiles again amused by Peters tactics

KATHY
No

his knees at the base of a window On the floor beside him is
a RULER and a SHEET OF RUBBERIZED PAPER

NOLAN
(proudly)

This is where he forced his way in We
found some fibers on the windowsill
probably particles of clothing that
rubbed off when he climbed through
Ill know more once I get it under the
microscope

FRANK
(not impressed)
Thats great

NOLAN
Wait Ive saved the best for last
Andy hit the lights will you

Andy looks for the light switch Kathy realizes shes standing
in front of it and moves out of the way Andy turns off the
lights and the room goes dark Nolan turns on a FLASHLIGHT and
gets down on his knees then SHINES the LIGHT at a LOW ANGLE
across the floor

THE FLOOR - CLOSE SHOT We can clearly see the impression of a
SHOE PRINT

NOLAN
Its a tennis shoe Pretty old by the
individual characteristics About a
size ten or eleven This guy is big

NOLAN

in the sole of the shoe Well blow it
up back at the lab

Kathy stares at the sight horrified She starts to gag and
runs from the room

FRANK
Same as the others

NOLAN
Yeah
FRANK
How long she been dead

NOLAN

FRANK

out pretty quick didnt he Maybe
its not to hard if you wrote it

INT PETERS HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Peter enters in his SWEATS to find Erica Jeremy and David
sitting around a computer

PETER
(to Jeremy)
We got a problem

Our computer went on the fritz again
David came up to fix it

Naw its all fixed I also loaded up
a program thatll analyze your games
three hundred percent faster

PETER
Whats this

DAVID
Oh I put a few games on for your
daughter I hope you dont mind

Of course not

DAVID
Well Ive got to go over Lutzs room

they come Then Ive got to practise
In case you forgot Im in the middle of
a match right now
JEREMY
Youre always in the middle of a match

PETER
I want to be the best I can

JEREMY

Sometimes I think youd rather be the
best chess player than the best
father Instead of thinking about what
kind of day your daughter had you
would rather think about the Sicilian
Najdorf opening or a counter to the
Tartokover Bondarevsky System

(Beat)
A relationship is not a chessboard
You cant walk away from it and come
back whenever you want and still expect
all the pieces to be there

Peter enters from the bathroom wearing only his jeans He goes
over to his briefcase and starts to take out a paper He
stops then slowly takes out an OLD WORN ENVELOPE He stares

She walks into the room

KATHY
They found the third girl Her name

Peters frustration grows He decides to try a different line

say

PETER
Then call them

Peter slams down the phon
that Peter would end the

ANDY
Are you crazy

always fair and just

CALLER (OS)
So is mine within the framework of my
rules

The line goes dead Peter hangs up

ANDY
What in the hell do you think youre
doing Slamming down the phone in the
middle of the trace

PETER
You think youre going to catch him on
a trace Everything he does is planned
out well in advance The only way
were going to get him is to rattle him
-- make him slip up

FRANK
You never know how youre going to
catch a suspect

KATHY
Peters right Captain Hes got to be

forced into making a mistake

ANDY
We didnt ask for your opinion Doctor

PETER
Maybe you should

Peter stares at Andy defiantly
ANDY
You dont tell us how to run our
investigation You got that
PETER
You dont have an investigation without
me You got that

The two men lock eyes hostilely

FRANK
What were you going to say Kathy

KATHY
Well I think you have to play to his
ego He thinks hes superior The
more secure he feels the more chances
hell take

FRANK
What did he mean by Huxley

PETER

He was referring to a quote by Thomas
Henry Huxley

(quoting)
The chess board is the world the
pieces are the phenomena of the
universe the rules of the game are
what we call Nature The player on the
other side is hidden from us We know
that his play is always fair just and
patient But also we know to our
cost that he never overlooks a
mistake or makes the smallest
allowances for ignorance

EXT PUGET SOUND - AFTERNOON

Peter and Kathy are sitting on the beach Peter draws squares
in the sand like a chessboard and starts moving shells and
rocks around Kathy grins

KATHY
Are you playing chess

Peter smiles like a boy with his hand caught in the cookie-jar

PETER

When I was little Id watch the other
kids playing baseball from my room In
the evening when their parents would
call them in to put their bats and
balls away Id watch them from my
window forcing expressions of
disappointment trying to gain another
few minutes outside so they could play
-- but no one could stop me from
playing

(he closes his eyes)
All I had to do was close my eyes and
my whole world became a chessboard I
could see the pieces and sometimes it
felt like if I reached out I could
almost touch them I ordered them and
they obeyed

Kathy stares at him for a moment unsure what to make of his
speech

Peter opens his eyes there is a beat as he seems to
bridge the gap back to this world He smiles

KATHY
Can you go fifteen minutes without
thinking about it

PETER
(thinks for a moment)
No But Im open to distractions

KATHY
Im sure you are

He smiles at her He destroys the pattern in the sand
her hand and they start walking

PETER
You know youre not the easiest person
in the world to get close to

KATHY
You always want to talk about me What

KATHY
Nobody could attack you You set your

Youre impregnable -- but at the same
time youve become trapped behind your
own defenses Youre cut off from
everyone around you

PETER
This frightens me -- because Im

KATHY
Youve got to face the things you feel

PETER
(a little grin)
I thought you were the woman who didnt
want to get involved

KATHY
I said I didnt plan on getting
involved

He moves closer She takes a step back

PETER
(moving closer)

feel

KATHY
(giving in)

easily This is not just another game

kisses her again Their passion builds until they throw their
arms around each other and embrace passionately

INT PETERS LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Peter pins her against the wall and kisses her She wraps her
legs around his waist as he holds her against the wall They
continue to kiss as they move along the wall knocking pictures
off the wall Peter carries her over to a LARGE CHESSBOARD
With one hand he sweeps the PIECES off onto the floor then
sits her down on it They kiss each other furiously each of
them groping at the others clothing Their hands move along
each others bodies exploring touching feeling He un-
buttons her blouse then kisses her neck working his way to
her breasts Kathy closes her eyes submitting to the pleasure
of his touch

the room retracing in his mind what could have happened He
sees the open PHONE BOOK on the dresser next to him He stares
at it for a moment then back at Kathy

PETER

She doesnt answer Peter appears disappointed

PETER
I was looking for correlations between

Behind him Lutz is pacing back

Yurilivich is waiting for him at the

CHESSBOARD The other two tables are vacant The President

addresses

the audience

PRESIDENT
Since Grandmaster Sanderson leads the
tournament with nine wins and
Grandmaster Yurilivich is in second
with eight -- it as become apparent
that with only four games remaining
the other players should they win all
four of their remaining games would
still not be in a position to win the
tournament Therefore we have decided
that the remaining games between
Grandmaster Sanderson and Yurilivich
will be held separately

FIGURE OF A MAN stands up out of one of the high-backed chairs
Peter senses something and spins around A LIGHT on the desk

ANDY
Scare you
Peter doesnt answer He stares at Andy hostilely

ANDY
You know I figure thats pretty much
how these girls feel just before they

PETER
I wouldnt know

ANDY
Thats right I guess only the killer
would know that

PETER
Howd you get in here

ANDY
The door was open

PETER
No it wasnt

ANDY
Of course it was Otherwise Id be
breaking and entering Thats a
felony

PETER
What do you want

ANDY
You ever do any hunting Peter

PETER
No

ANDY
I used to With my old man He taught
me how to hunt and trap Trappings a
lot harder than most people think We
used to go after Raccoons mostly
Theyd get into our garbage our
fields When an animal cant live
peacefully with those around it it has
to be destroyed But theyre crafty
little devils You see the trick is
you can put your trap down but no
Raccoon is going come near it unless
you lay down the scent You ever smell
Raccoon scent Smells like shit but
to a male Raccoon it smells just like
pussy Hell walk right up to that
trap even though it dont look nothing

like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam
head right in it You know why Cause
he cant help himself The scent
drives him So if you want to catch a
Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out
where he is -- lay down the scent --
and sooner or later hell walk right
into the trap

PETER
What if he doesnt bite What if hes
an exceptionally bright Raccoon

ANDY

Well then you just gotta find out
where he is -- and once youre sure
where he is -- you shoot the fucker

A beat They stare at each other Andy walks to the door and
leaves

You like to brag dont you

CALLER (OS)
Credit should be given where its due
Im not worldly like you Peter Im
not an internationally known figure

determination covers Peters face

PETER
So why were you looking for Doctor
Sheppard today

PETER
You heard me Why did you go out to
the institute looking for her

CALLER (OS)

Well Im closer than you think pal --

The line goes dead Peter hangs up his frustration shows

INT POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

Peter sits across the desk from Frank Kathy stands by the
window The room is crowded with the Callers clues The MAP
with colored pins in it The words REMEMBER EVENTUALLY
REVENGE IS A copy of the Callers NOTE written on the
blackboard It reads

PETER
IN A FIERCE MAGAZINE YOU WILL FIND A HINT OF MY ACTION TO COME
AS LARGE AS YOU MAYBE IN THE WORLD OF PAWNS AND CASTLES YOU ARE

STILL LIGHT YEARS FROM REACHING ME INVISIBLE AS THE AIR ONE
HUNDRED MEN WITH THEIR DESPERATE PLEAS TO STOP CANT MOVE ME

Peter walks over to the BLACKBOARD and studies the note

PETER
(reading)
In a fierce magazine youll find a hint
of my actions to come Why does he
set this line apart

KATHY
For emphasis

PETER
Exactly Its the key

KATHY
But what does he mean by a fierce
magazine Violent

PETER
A fierce magazine brutal
(thinking aloud)
An angry magazine A war magazine
a mercenary magazine fierce
(he gets it)
Mad

KATHY
What

PETER
Wheres the note

ANDY
You got it on the board

PETER
No I need the original note

ANDY
Theres a photostat of the original on
the wall

Peter gets up and takes the note off the wall and studies it
for a moment then starts to fold it in half

PETER
My daughter reads Mad Magazine all the
time If you fold the back cover a
certain way the text reads
differently

Peter moves the crease of the paper in and out until it forms
the correct margin

The NOTE now reads
IN A FIERCE
AS LARGE AS

STILL LIGHT
ONE HUNDRED

Kathy looks

ACTION TO COME
CASTLES YOU ARE

AS THE AIR
MEN CANT MOVE ME

at Peter impressed

PETER
(reading)

As large as castles You are still
light as air one hundred men cant
move me

FRANK

It doesnt make sense

KATHY

It doesnt make sense because we dont
understand it

ANDY

But a hundred men could move him

PETER
(losing patience)

Hes not talking about himself

ANDY

Then whats he talking about

PETER
(on edge)

If we knew that wed know the answer to
the riddle wouldnt we Hes telling

us where hes going to kill tonight and
we cant see it

FRANK

Maybe we should back up a minute and
take a look at what we do have All
the girls that have been killed have
been killed at night Theyre all the
same type All moved into their homes

within the last three months -- and all
of them found their homes through
Homesearchers

KATHY
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead

end

FRANK

It cant be a coincidence The woman
that owns it has a son She says hes
been on vacation in Montana for the
last ten days Were trying to locate
him Theres also a cleaning service
that comes in once a week Were
checking that out too

KATHY
He moves around a lot Why

ANDY
He finds his victims through
Homesearchers He goes where they are

Peter is only half-listening to the conversation He appears
deep in thought

KATHY
But they rent lots of apartments He
could probably find them all ina
localized area Why move all over the
Island

Peter slowly comes to a realization His eyes open wide as a
thought crashes into his mind

PETER
Jesus It cant be that easy

Peter walks to the MAP of the victims locations on the wall

He moves his finger from point to point examining each
location Kathy Frank and Andy watch him Peter continues to
move his finger in various GEOMETRIC LINES across the map

ANDY
You want to tell us what the hell
youre doing

Peter doesnt answer He stares at the MAP for a few more
seconds as the excitement of his realization grows He takes
a step back and turns to Kathy

PETER

He told us and we missed it He said
hes never been anywhere Therefore
this Island is the world to him

(pointing to the map)
As far as hes concerned this is a map
of the world Thats why he quoted
Huxley The chessboard is the world

Peter takes a MARKS-O-LOT off Kathys desk and DRAWS a LARGE
SQUARE BORDER on the MAP OUTLINING THE GRIDS EIGHT BY EIGHT
PETER
Hes using the map as a chessboard
The sonofabitch is playing chess with
me

FRANK
How can he be playing Chess with you
Youre not making any moves against

him

PETER
Maybe I already have

Peter rushes towards the door

INT AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

DAVID

PETER
Okay Run a search to see if there are

thousand that live on the Island

David enters the commands on the keyboard

DAVID
Nope Nothing

PETER
Set up some pieces on the big board

FRANK
I still dont see how he could be
playing chess against you Theres
only enough grids on the map to be half
a board

PETER
Thats all he needs Hes making the
moves Its an opening I just cant
remember the name
(looks at the board)
Okay its a game Hes starting it
so he moves first Hes white e2-e4

The pieces on the board move following Peters instructions

PETER

D2-d4 bl-c3 and cl-f4

(he studies the board)
Its the number two variation of the
Tarakoss opening

(thinks for a moment)
David can you bring up the tournament
records for the last ten years

DAVID
Mister Sanderson theyll be hundreds
of thousands of games

PETER
Were only interested in people who
have played against me

David enters the data

DAVID
Now what

PETER
Have computer search for anyone thats
used that opening against me There
cant be more than a handful

David enters the information and waits

DAVID

INT PETERS LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Peter Kathy and all stand around a map of the Island
looks at a PRINTOUT

Hes replaying the game I played
against him move by move using these
girls as the Chess pieces
(Beat)
All the girls have been found in their
homes except Christie Eastman who was
found in back of a warehouse Why

KATHY
(making the
connection)
Because to follow the game he played he
had to move to that grid

PETER
Right
(he searches the map
and points to a spot)
Here c-4

FRANK
Its a commercial area No one lives
there

PETER

But he had to dump the body there to
make the move

KATHY
Now that you know what stage of the
game hes at can we figure out where
his next move is going to be

tates

Peter
Peter walks over to the MAP and traces his finger over it then
looks at the computer printout

PETER
His last move was cl-f4 I would move
fÂ£8-g7 His next move using the

Tarakoss would be e2-e3 that
would be

(points to a spot)
Right here

There is a moment of silence as Kathy Frank and Andy both
digest what they have heard

KATHY
Each of those grids represents almost a
square mile

FRANK
Thats a big area to cover

PETER

signaling for him to come in Kathy sits down on the arm-rest
of a chair Peter stands A beat

PETER
The other night -- I said some things
that maybe I shouldnt have I mean
you havent known me very long and I
can see how you thought what you did

KATHY
Im not looking for an apology Peter
PETER
I was thinking that maybe when this
is all over we could

KATHY
I want someone I can get close to I
dont know if thats possible with you

PETER
You really havent seen my best side

KATHY
Peter

PETER
No listen You have no idea of the
kind of pressure Im under right now

KATHY
Thats still no excuse You treat
everything like a game

PETER

I cant think any more unless its
about you Ill be in the middle of a
match and instead of thinking about my
next move I think about how you look
when you smile

(Beat)
Remember how you said that I hide
behind my chessboard Ever since my
wife died Ive been

(this isnt easy)
Ive been afraid of getting too close
to someone again -- afraid of losing
them

KATHY
Youre wife died You cant feel
responsible for that

PETER
You dont understand

KATHY
Then help me to understand I want to
understand

PETER
Its not that easy

KATHY
Of course it isnt Its always
difficult when someone you love dies

But you cant feel responsible because
she had a car accident

PETER
But I do

KATHY
Why

PETER

Because she killed herself

(softer)
She killed herself

(Beat)
She drove her car over that cliff

(Beat)
Oh the police said it was an accident
-- but I knew Ive always known I
closed myself off to her and after I
found the letter I closed myself off to
everything else Beating Yurilivich
and playing for the title was all I
could think about -- but I snapped I
had a breakdown in the middle of the
match I dont remember too much about
it

He removes the envelope from his pocket

PETER
This letter Ive never opened it

KATHY
Why not

PETER
Because I know what it says

KATHY
Maybe youre afraid of what it says

A beat Peter walks to the couch and sits down He stares at
the envelope then starts to open it He stops and looks up at
Kathy who nods her head Kathy starts to leave

PETER
Will you stay with me

Kathy sits beside him He opens the envelope and starts to
read

WOMANS VOICE
Peter There are many pains we feel in
this world -- but loving someone who
has shut you out of his life has to be
His eyes fill with tears

the most unbearable of them all I
knew when we married that you were a
man consumed with ambition but
somewhere along the way your
chessboard became your wife and I
became your mistress

(Beat)
I know now that you cannot change
cannot give me the things I need You
may think that Im a coward for what I
am about to do but it is my choice
My release I only ask that you shield
Erica from the truth and that you
forgive me for being so weak

Doctor Sheppard what goes on in the
mind of someone like this

KATHY
Thats a very difficult question to
answer

REPORTER

Is there a usual scenario

KATHY
Well -- yes usually we find theyve
had a traumatic childhood He was
probably abused by a dominant female
figure That coupled with the fact
that these girls have not been raped
leads me to believe that he is either
impudent or a latent homosexual
Regardless hes acting out some type
of revenge fantasy that fulfills some
sick sexual needs

The guilt he has carried for so long
is released Kathy puts her arm around him He turns to her

He does not notice the door open
Jeremy notices Peter He turns off the TV

actions of this department by sharing
knowledge with someone who is
emotionally involved with the prime
suspect

KATHY
(pointing to Andy)
And what if hes wrong If you were
one hundred percent sure it was Peter

CALLER (OS)
Dont beg Peter She has to die I
cant win unless she dies

Peter hears the SOUND again

CALLER (OS)

but Ive decided its better if you
dont know exactly when I kill her
Good-bye Peter

PETER
No Wait

The line goes dead Peters mind races

PETER
A few seconds Where could he have
gone in a few seconds Think Think

He looks towards the window
PETERS POV of the wind blowing through the trees outside
Peters face floods with realization

PETER
Steam pipes

Peter dials a THREE DIGIT number on the phone

INT HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT

The MAN wearing a black rain-coat walks across the room towards
an alcove The door to the alcove is OPEN and we see Erica who
is tied to a chair and gagged WATER FLOODS in through cracks
in the foundation flooding the room

THE PHONE RINGS He stops startled by the sound his head
snapping towards the phone The MAN is stunned His mind
races He thinks for a moment He walks back to the phone and
slowly lifts the receiver

PETER (OS)
I know where you are

CALLER
Very good How did you know

PETER (VO)
The pipes

The MAN looks at the PIPES They RATTLE The realization of
his mistake dawns on him

CALLER
Excellent It doesnt matter You
still lose Shell still be dead
before you can get down here

The MAN slams down the receiver CLICK The blade snaps out of
the STILETTO He walks quickly back towards the alcove the
KNIFE clutched tightly in his hand He stops for a moment at
the door as he prepares for the act ahead

Erica stares at him as he approaches with wide-eyed terror
The MAN moves towards her then stops sensing something is
wrong

The door slowly CLOSES revealing Peter standing behind it
Franks gun aimed at him in one hand the CORDLESS PHONE in the
other

PETER
(dryly)
Checkmate

Peter turns on the LIGHTS The MAN turns around It is David
the computer technician He slowly brings the KNIFE to his
side hiding it behind his leg

CALLER
Howd you know I wouldnt be in the
same room with her

PETER
You told me When you called you said
she was in the other room Drop the
knife

The Caller shrugs his shoulder then drops it They stare at
each other David takes a little step closer

PETER
Computers Thats how you got into
Homesearchers records You can get
into anything But why Why

DAVID
You still havent figured it out have
you You think that Ive put you
through an ordeal My scars run so
much deeper than yours

PETER
What scars

DAVID
(moving closer)
The scars on your chest From where I
stabbed you with my fountain pen
Shock pours over Peters face as his mind drifts back to a
tournament twenty years ago

PETER
We were only children

David lunges at Peter Peter raises the gun Too late David
is too close He pushes Peters hand away They struggle over
the gun

the air At the same moment a CLAP OF THUNDER BOOMS overhead

EXT HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT

towards her

INT HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT
David repeatedly smashes Peters hand into the wall THE GUN
FIRES INTO THE AIR SEVERAL TIMES A bullet hits an over head

INT HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT

David smashes Peters hand into the wall until the gun falls to

is unleashed He slams Peters back into the wall knocking
the wind out of him

INT HOTEL UTILITY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Frank races through the hallway

INT HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT

The fight continues STEAM SWIRLS through the room David
slams his elbow into Peters face Blood pours out of Peters
nose David raises his knee kicking Peter in the stomach
Peter doubles over David picks up a lamp off the desk and
smashes it over Peters head Peter drops to the ground
David picks up his knife and walks over to Peter then lifts
his head out of the water

DAVID
They took everything from me -- because
of you -- and now Im going to take

everything from you

David opens the door to the alcove then walks back to Peter
He bends down and presses the BLADE to Peters neck Fora
moment we sense he is going to kill Peter then he grabs him
by the hair lifting his head up so he can see

PETERS POV Erica is sitting in the alcove tied to the
chair

Peter is only semi-conscious David starts to leave David is
just about at the alcove door when Frank enters the room his
weapon drawn Then looks at Peter then David

DAVID

(moving towards Frank)
Thank God youre here I heard Erica
scream and came in to see what was
going on Mister Sanderson was going
to stab her

(holds up the knife)
With this

Frank looks at the knife

FRANKS POV There is a DEEP CUT on Davids wrist exactly
like Peters

Franks face registers the cut David notes it Before Frank
can even look at him David thrusts the blade into his stomach
The force drives Frank back against the wall His gun drops
from his hand as Frank slides to the floor

Peter tries to grab Davids leg as he heads towards the alcove
Frank pulls up his pant leg revealing his backup gun He tries
to reach for it

INT HOTEL BASEMENT ALCOVE - NIGHT

David enters the room Through the STEAM he sees Kathy trying
to untie Erica David stares at them his lips spread into
maniacal grin The OVERHEAD LIGHTS FLASH on and off
intermittently

KATHY
This isnt going to help David
Youre mothers dead You cant undo
it

DAVID

You dont understand

KATHY
Yes I do I found your file I know
what happened

DAVID
They took away the game because of him
My father left and my mother There
was so much blood It covered
everything
KATHY
I know but this isnt going to bring
her back

DAVID

Dont you see I had to make it right
I ignored my mothers crossing I sat
with them all I held their hands I
stroked their hair I was with them to
the end I took away the blood I
washed them Their crossing was
peaceful

KATHY
I think your mother knows that now
Why dont you put the knife down Put
it down David

For a moment it appears he is thinking about it He lowers the
blade but his need to kill is to strong He raises it again

DAVID
She has to die

His face tenses He lunges towards Erica
BANG A shot tears through his chest The impact blows him
off his feet He falls back into the murky water and
disappears

Peter stands in the doorway straining to stay conscious
Franks GUN aimed at David

Kathy quickly finishes untying Erica They run to the corner
of the room Kathy holds her close

Peter slowly staggers forward He probes the water with his
feet checking for Davids body The MURKY WATER THE STEAM
and the BLINKING LIGHTS dont make it easy Peter leans over
pointing the gun at the ground

PETERS POV The MURKY WATER Suddenly a HAND streaks out of
the water

The hand grabs Peter around the neck David stands up quickly
They struggle over the gun They both fall backwards into the
water Peter surfaces and crawls backwards David stands up
They locks eyes Peter stares back with a deadly calmness

PETER
The games over asshole

David starts to lunge for him Peter empties the GUN into him
His body jerks backwards violently smashing into the wall
then he slides down and dies slowly disappearing under the
surface of the water

EXT HOTEL GROUNDS - LATER - NIGHT

BLACK and WHITE UNITS fill the area their RED LIGHTS FLASHING
UNIFORMED OFFICERS hold back the CROWD of on-lookers

Peter sits off to the side He looks worn to the point of
exhaustion A PARAMEDIC attends to the wounds on his face
Erica sits beside him clinging to his arm TWO MEN carry a
STRETCHER the body on it is covered Peter stares at it
blankly as it passes

Kathy is standing at the rear of an AMBULANCE The doors close
and it drives off She walks over to Peter and Erica

KATHY
Franks going to be alright They
dont think any major arteries were
severed

The information doesnt seem to register with Peter He
continues to stare ahead blankly

KATHY
Peter you beat him
He slowly looks over at her but says nothing

KATHY
You beat him

PETER
I got lucky

KATHY
Theres a girl in the hospital who is
going to live because of you You made
a difference

Peter just continues to stare at her

KATHY
Peter Im sorry I doubted you but--

Peter reaches forwards and places his fingers on her lips

PETER

KATHY
I just wanted you to know in case you
thought about it in the future

PETER
