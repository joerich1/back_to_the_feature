FADE IN
EXT A SENTRY TOWER --

-- in the middle of the night in the middle of

nowhere

Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the
tower

cut through the ground mist We HEAR all the
unidentifiable

sounds of night in the woods We also HEAR very very

faintly a slow deliberate drum cadence And as this
starts

we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER more becomes
visible

now the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high
the

steel fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the
structure

and leading to the lookout post and finally THE
LOOKOUT

POST maybe forty feet off the ground

Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE Hes
holding

a rifle and staring straight out

The drum cadence has been building slightly

The drum cadence continues and we

INT A MARINE BARRACKS

We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR

where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and
two young marines who well get to know later They
when they get to a certain door The drum cadence is
growing DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns
slowly He openss the door and they walk into

INT SANTIAGOS ROOM - NIGHT

WILLY SANTIAGO a young very slight marine lies

his bunk

DAWSON kneels down by the bed puts his hand on
shoulder and shakes him gently SANTIAGO opens his yes
at DAWSON and for a moment theres nothing wrong --

-- and then SANTIAGOs eyes fill with terror He lunges
of the bed -- but forget about it In one flash DAWSON
DOWNEY grab him out of bed and before the scream can

out DOWNEYs shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGOs

Yes

JO
This last letter to the Naval
investigative Service --

it to KAFFEE who hands it to Sam --

JO
(continuing)
-- where he offers information about
Corporal Dawsons fenceline shooting
in exchange for a transfer was just
a last ditch effort

KAFFEE

to kill Santiago

KAFFEE
Gotcha
(beat)
And Santiago is who

JO
(beat)
The victim

KAFFEE

(to SAM)
Write that down

(to JO)
Am I correct in assuming that these
letters dont paint a flattering
picture of marine corps life in
Guantanamo Bay

JO
Yes among other --

KAFFEE
And am I further right in assuming
that a protracted investigation of
this incident might cause some
embarrassment for the security counsel

guy

JO
Colonel Jessep yes but --

KAFFEE

KAFFEE
Twelve years I can get it knocked

reasons such as feeling dizzy or
nauseated but on May 18th Id fallen
back about 20 or 30 yards going down
a rocky unstable hill My sergeant
grabbed me and pushed me down the
hill Then I saw all black and the
last thing I remember is hitting the
deck I was brought to the hospital

exhaustion and was explained to by
the doctor that my body has trouble

SANTIAGO (VO)
PS In exchange for my transfer
off the base Im willing to provide
you with information about an illegal
fenceline shooting that occurred the
night of August 2nd
And as these last words are spoken we PULL BACK TO
REVEAL
COLONEL NATHAN R JESSEP who drops the letter hes
been
reading on his desk where it joins a stack of other
letters

just like it

JESSEPs a born leader considered in many circles to
be one
of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps Hes smart

asa
whip with a sense of humor to match As soon as he
drops the
letter he says
JESSEP
Who the fuck is PFC William T
Santiago
Hes talking to his two senior officers CAPTAIN
MARKINSON
is in his late 40s Hes a career marine and a nice
guy in
a world where nice guys may not finish last but they
sure
as shit dont finish first Lt JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK
is
26 from Georgia and an Academy graduate
If you asked him hed tell you that the gates to heaven
are
guarded by the US Marine Corps
KENDRICK
Sir Santiago is a member of Second
Platoon Delta
JESSEP
Yeah well apparently hes not very
happy down here at Shangri-La cause
hes written letters to everyone but
Santa Claus asking for a transfer
And now hes telling tales about a
fenceline shooting
He tosses the letter over to MARKINSON MARKINSON is
looking

it over JESSEP is waiting for a response

JESSEP
(continuing)
Matthew
MARKINSON

Im appalled sir

JESSEP
Youre appalled This kid broke the
Chain of Command and he ratted ona
man of his unit to say nothing of
the fact that hes a US Marine and
it would appear that he cant run
from here to there without collapsing
from heat exhaustion What the fucks
going on over at Windward Matthew

MARKINSON
Colonel I think perhaps it would be
better to hold this discussion in
private

KENDRICK
That wont be necessary Colonel
Ill handle the situation

MARKINSON
The same way you handled the Curtis
Barnes incident Youre doing
something wrong Lieutenant this --

KENDRICK
My methods of leadership are --

MARKINSON
Dont interrupt me Im still your
superior officer

JESSEP
And Im yours Matthew

The room calms down for a moment

JESSEP
(continuing)
I want to know what were gonna do
about this

MARKINSON
I think Santiago should be transferred
off the base Right away

JESSEP
Hes that bad huh

MARKINSON

Not only that but word of this
letters bound to get out The kids
gonna get his ass kicked

JESSEP

Transfer Santiago Yes I suppose
youre right I suppose thats the
thing to do Wait Wait Ive got a

better idea Lets transfer the whole
squad off the base Lets -- on second
thought -- Windward The whole
Windward division lets transfer
em off the base Jon go on out
there and get those boys down off
the fence theyre packing their
bags

(calling out)
Tom

The ORDERLY cones in from the outer office

ORDERLY
Sir

JESSEP
Got me the President on the phone
were surrendering our position in
Cuba

ORDERLY
Yes sir

JESSEP
Wait a minute Tom

The ORDERLY stops

JESSEP

(continuing)
Dont call the President just yet
Maybe we should consider this for a
second Maybe -- and Im just spit
balling here -- but maybe we as
officers have a responsibility to
train Santiago Maybe we as officers
have a responsibility to this country
to see that the men and women charged
with its security are trained
professionals Yes Im certain I
once read that somewhere And now
Im thinking that your suggestion of
transferring Santiago while
expeditious and certainly painless
might not be in a manner of speaking
the American way Santiago stays
where he is Were gonna train the
lad Youre in charge Jon Santiago
doesnt make 41 on his next fitness
report Im gonna blame you Then
Im gonna kill you

KENDRICK
Yes sir

MARKINSON
I think thats a mistake Colonel

JESSEP
Matthew I believe I will have that
word in private with you now Jon
thats all Why dont you and I have
lunch at the 0 club well talk
about the training of young William

KENDRICK
Yes sir Id be delighted to hear
any suggestions you have

JESSEP
Dismissed
KENDRICK is gone
JESSEP
(continuing)

Matthew sit please
MARKINSON sits

JESSEP
(continuing)
What do you think of Kendrick

MARKINSON
(beat)
I dont know that --

JESSEP

I think hes kind of a weasel myself
But hes an awfully good officer

and in the end we see eye to eye on
the best way to run a marine corps
unit Were in the business of saving
lives Matthew Thats a
responsibility we have to take pretty
seriously And I believe that taking
a marine whos not yet up to the job
and packing him off to another
assignment puts lives in danger

the cars pull up As soon as they come to a stop all
doors swing open and various uniformed and non-
officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where

escort DAWSON and DOWNEY in handcuffs out of the car
HAROLD DAWSONs a handsome young black corporal

controlled and utterly professional
LOUDEN DOWNEYs a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm

Hes
happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to

KAFFEE

JO walks up from behind the backstop

JO
Excuse me

KAFFEE
You want to suit up We need all the
help we can get

JO
No thank you I cant throw and
catch things

KAFFEE
Thats okay neither can they

JO
I wanted to talk to you about Corporal
Dawson and Private Downey
KAFFEE
Say again

JO
Dawson and Downey

KAFFEE
(beat)
Those names sound like they should
mean something to me but Im just
not --

JO
Dawson Downey Your clients

KAFFEE
The Cuba thing Yes Dawson and
Downey
(beat)
Right
(pause)

Ive done something wrong again
havent I

JO
I was wondering why two guys have
been in a jail cell since this morning
while their lawyer is outside hitting
a ball

KAFFEE
We need the practice

JO
That wasnt funny

KAFFEE
It was a little funny

JO
Lieutenant would you feel very
insulted if I recommended to your
supervisor that he assign different
counsel

KAFFEE
Why

JO
I dont think youre fit to handle
this defense
KAFFEE
You dont even know me Ordinarily
it takes someone hours to discover
Im not fit to handle a defense

Jo just stares

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Oh come on that was damn funny

Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of
confidentiality

JO
I do know you Daniel AlliStair
Kaffee born June 8th 1964 at Boston
Mercy Hospital Your fathers Lionel
Kaffee former Navy Judge Advocate
and Attorney General of the United
States died 1985 You went to Harvard
Law on a Navy scholarship probably
because thats what your father wanted
you to do and now youre just
treading water for the three years
youve gotta serve in the JAG Corps
just kinda layin low til you can
get out and get a real job And if
thats the situation thats fine I
wont tell anyone But my feeling is
that if this case is handled in the
same fast-food slick-ass Persian
Bazaar manner with which you seem to
handle everything else somethings
gonna get missed And I wouldnt be
doing my job if I allowed Dawson and
Downey to spend any more time in
prison than absolutely necessary
because their attorney had pre-
determined the path of least
resistance

KAFFEE cant help but be impressed by that speech

KAFFEE
Wow
(beat)
Im sexually aroused Commander

JO
I dont think your clients murdered
anybody

KAFFEE
What are you basing this on

JO
There was no intent

KAFFEE
The doctors report says that Santiago
died of asphyxiation brought on by
acute lactic acidosis and that the
nature of the acidosis strongly
suggests poisoning

(beat)

Now I dont know what any of that
means but it sounds pretty bad

JO
Santiago died at one am At three
the doctor was unable to determine
the cause of death but two hours
later he said it was poison

KAFFEE
Oh now I see what youre saying
It had to be Professor Plum in the
library with the candlestick

JO
Im gonna speak to your supervisor

KAFFEE
Okay You go straight up Pennsylvania
Avenue Its a big white house with
pillars in front

JO
Thank you

KAFFEE
I dont think youll have much luck
though I was assigned by Division

Im a good lawyer So while I
appreciate your interest and admire
your enthusiasm I think I can pretty
much handle things myself

DAWSON

a Cuban counterpart Theyre called
mirrors The corporals claiming
that his mirror was about to fire at
him

KAFFEE
Santiagos letter to the NIS said
you fired illegally Hes saying
that the guy the mirror he never
made a move

DAWSON says nothing

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Oh Harold
SAM is staring at DAWSON

KAFFEE
(continuing)
You see what Im getting at If

DAWSON

He went outside his unit sir If he
had a problem he shouldve spoken
to me sir Then his Sergeant then
Company Commander then --

KAFFEE
Yeah yeah alright Harold did you
assault Santiago with the intent of

DAWSON

KAFFEE

DAWSON

himself To respect the code

SAM

JO
(to JESSEP)
I was wondering if youve ever heard
the term Code Red

KAFFEE
Jo --

JESSEP
Ive heard the term yes

JO
Colonel this past February you
received a cautionary memo from the
Naval Investigative Service warning
that the practice of enlisted men
disciplining their own wasnt to be
condoned by officers

JESSEP

I submit to you that whoever wrote
that memo has never served on the
working end of a Soviet-made Cuban
M1-Al6 Assault Rifle However the
directive having come from the NIS
I gave it its due attention Whats
your point Jo

KAFFEE
She has no point She often has no
point Its part of her charm Were
outta here Thank you

JO
My point is that I think code reds
still go on down here Do Code Reds
still happen on this base colonel

KAFFEE
Jo the colonel doesnt need to answer

that

JO
Yes he does

KAFFEE
No he really doesnt

JO
Yeah he really does Colonel

JESSEP
You know it just hit me She outranks
you Danny

KAFFEE

Youre the luckiest man in the world
There is believe me gentlemen
nothing sexier on earth than a woman
you have to salute in the morning
Promote em all I say

JOs not upset JOs not mad But shes gonna ask her
question
til she gets an answer

JO
Colonel the practice of code Reds
is still condoned by officers on
this base isnt it

JESSEP
You see my problem is of course
that Im a Colonel Ill just have
to keep taking cold showers til
they elect some gal President

JO
I need an answer to my question
sir

JESSEP

Take caution in your tone Commander
Im a fair guy but this fuckin
heats making me absolutely crazy

You want to know about code reds

On the record I tell you that I
discourage the practice in accordance
with the NIS directive Off the record
I tell you that its an invaluable
part of close infantry training and
if it happens to go on without my
knowledge so be it I run my base
how I run my base You want to
investigate me roll the dice and
take your chances I eat breakfast
80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who
are trained to kill me So dont for
one second think youre gonna come
down here flash a badge and make
me nervous

A moment of tense silence before --

Santiago Now is that true I want
you to speak freely

DAWSON

INT THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

ROSS is playing a game of full-court basketball with

other OFFICERS

A door at the far end of the court opens and KAFFEE and
JO

KAFFEE shouts --

KAFFEE
Jack

But ROSS is into the game

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Jack

ROSS
(waving him off)
Hang on

KAFFEE
They were given an order

ROSS stops cold and looks over at Kaffee The game
flies by

him He motions to the locker room door in the corner
of the

gym and the three of them make their way to privacy
JO
How long have you known about the
order

ROSS

I didnt --
(to KAFFEE)

Who is this

KAFFEE

lawyer Shes very pleased to meet

you

ROSS
What exactly are you accusing me of
commander

JO

Im accusing you of --
Theyre in the
LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT
and KAFFEE slams the door shut behind them

KAFFEE
Jack didnt know about the order
Because if he did and he hadnt told
us Jack knows hed be violating
about 14 articles of the code of
ethics As it is hes got enough to
worry about God forbid our clients
decide to plead not guilty and testify
for the record that they were given
an order

ROSS
Kendrick specifically told the men
not to touch Santiago

KAFFEE
Thats right And then he went into
Dawson and Downeys room and
specifically told them to give hima
code red

ROSS
Thats not what Kendrick said

KAFFEE
Kendricks lying

ROSS
You have proof

KAFFEE
I have the defendants

ROSS
And I have 23 marines who arent
accused of murder and a lieutenant
with four letters of commendation

KAFFEE
Why did Markinson resign his
commission

ROSS
Well never know

KAFFEE
You dont think I can subpoena
Markinson

ROSS

You can try but you wont find him
You know what Markinson did for the
first 17 of his 21 years in the corps
Counter Intelligence Markinsons
gone There is no Markinson

Some of the wind has been taken Out of Kaffees sails

ROSS
(continuing)
Jesseps star is on the rise

spare Jessep and the corps any
embarrassment

KAFFEE

me by the balls out here Dan knows
that in a courtroom he loses this
case Dannys an awfully talented
lawyer and hes not about to send

general court-martial stand forward

Alexander Randolph is presiding God
save the United States of America

RANDOLPH raps the gavel

RANDOLPH without objection the sworn confessions of
the two
defendants have been read to the jury and entered into
the
court record

ROSS
No objection your honor

KAFFEE
No objection

RANDOLPH
Is the Government prepared to make
an opening statement

ROSS
(standing)
Yes sir

ROSS walks to the jury box

ROSS

(continuing)
The facts of the case are this At
midnight on August 6th the defendants
went into the barracks room of their
platoon-mate PFC William Santiago
They woke him up tied his arms and
legs with rope and forced a rag
into his throat A few minutes later
a chemical reaction in Santiagos
body called lactic acidosis caused
his lungs to begin bleeding He
drowned in his own blood and was
pronounced dead at 32 minutes past
midnight These are the facts of the
case And they are undisputed Thats
right The story I just told you is
the exact same story youre going to
hear from Corporal Dawson and its
the exact same story youre going to
hear from Private Downey Furthermore
the Government will also demonstrate
that the defendants soaked the rag
with poison and entered Santiagos
room with motive and intent to kill

(beat)
Now Lt Kaffee is gonna try to
pull off a little magic act hes
gonna try a little misdirection
Hes going to astonish you with
stories of rituals and dazzle you
with official sounding terms like
Code Red He might even cut into a
few officers for you Hell have no
evidence mind you none But its
gonna be entertaining When we get
to the end all the magic in the
world will not have been able to
divert your attention from the fact
that Willy Santiago is dead and
Dawson and Downey killed him These
are the facts of the case

(beat)
And they are undisputed

ROSS walks back to his seat

RANDOLPH
Lt Kaffee

Before KAFFEEs even stood up these words are coming
out of
his mouth

KAFFEE

There was no poison on the rag and
there was no intent to kill and any
attempt to prove otherwise is futile
because it just aint true
(beat)
When Dawson and Downey went into
Santiagos room that night it wasnt
because of vengeance or hatred it
wasnt to kill or harm and it wasnt
because they were looking for kicks
on a Friday night Its because it
was what they were ordered to do
(beat)
Let me say that again Its because
it was what they were ordered to do
Now out in the real world that
means nothing And here at the
Washington Navy Yard it doesnt
mean a whole lot more But if youre
a marine assigned to Rifle Security
Company Windward Guantanamo Bay
Cuba and youre given an order you
follow it or you pack your bags

(beat)
Make no mistake about it Harold
Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting
before you in judgement today because
they did their job

KAFFEE walks back to the table and takes his seat

RANDOLPH
Is the Government ready to call its
first witness

ROSS
Please the Court the Government
calls Mr RC McGuire

While McCGUIRE a civilian in his late 30s is being
sworn
in KAFFEE has sat back down

He leans over to DAWSON and whispers

KAFFEE
How you doin

DAWSON doesnt change his expression

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Good

ROSS
Mr McGuire would you state your
full name and occupation for the
record please

MCGUIRE

MCGUIRE
That a member of Private Santiagos
unit had illegally fired his weapon
over the fenceline

ROSS

letter

MCGUIRE
No sir I notified the barracks CO
Colonel Jessep that I would be coming
down to investigate

ROSS
And what did you find

MCGUIRE

For the shift reported only one
sentry returned his weapon to the
switch with a round of ammunition
missing

ROSS
And who was that

MCGUIRE
Lance Corporal Harold Dawson

ROSS
(continuing to KAFFEE)
Your witness

ROSS goes back to his table KAFFEE stands

KAFFEE
Mr McGuire have you questioned
Corporal Dawson about the fenceline
shooting

MCGUIRE
Yes He claims to have been engaged
in some manner by the enemy

KAFFEE
But you dont believe him

MCGUIRE
Its not my place --

KAFFEE
Corporal Dawsons been charged with
a number of crimes why wasnt he
charged with firing at the enemy
without cause

MCGUIRE
There wasnt enough evidence to
support such a charge
KAFFEE
Thank you

KAFFEE sits

ROSS
Mr McGuire I dont understand what
you mean when you say there wasnt
enough evidence to support such a
charge You had Willy Santiagos
letter

MCGUIRE
Santiago was the only witness but I
never had a chance to interview him
So I dont know what he saw

ROSS
And now we wont ever know will we
Mr McGuire

MCGUIRE
No

KAFFEE
Please the Court is the judge
advocate honestly asking this witness
to testify as to how the defendant
felt on August 6th

RANDOLPH
Sustained

ROSS
Corporal did Lt Kendrick leave a
standing order at that meeting

RANDOLPH
Yes sir

ROSS
What was it

HAMMAKER
Well it was clear that he didnt
want us to take matters into our own
hands sir

ROSS
What was the order

HAMMAKER
Sir he said that Santiago wasnt to
be touched

ROSS
(to KAFFEE)
Your witness

KAFFEE
Corporal Hammaker were you in Dawson
and Downeys barracks room ten minutes
after this meeting

HAMMAKER
No sir

KAFFEE
Thanks I have no more questions

HAMMAKER gets off the stand and KAFFEE watches while
walks

past DAWSON and DOWNEY A barely perceptible exchange
occurs

between the eyes of DAWSON and HAMMAKER

KAFFEE makes a decision

ROSS
The Government calls Corporal Raymond
Thomas --

KAFFEE

Please the Court I understand Lt
Ross is planning on calling all the
other members of Rifle Security
Company Windward to testify

ROSS
In light of the defense that Lt
Kaffee is planning to mount the
explicit instructions of the platoon
leader seems particularly relevant
testimony

KAFFEE
The defense is willing to concede
that all 23 witnesses will testify
substantially as Corporal Hammaker
did if the Government is willing to
concede that none of them were in
Dawson and Downeys room at 1620 on
August 6th

RANDOLPH
(to ROSS)
Lieutenant

ROSS
The Governmentll agree to the

stipulation sir

RANDOLPH
Then well adjourn for the day You
can call your next witness in the
morning

CUT TO

SHOT OF WASHINGTON AT NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO

THE PARADE GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING two SAILORS are

raising

the flag
CUT TO

INT THE COURTROOM - DAY

COMMANDER STONE a Navy doctor in his mid-40s is on
the

stand

STONE
And he was pronounced dead at
zero-zero-thirty-seven

ROSS
Dr Stone whats lactic acidosis

STONE
If the muscles and other cells of
the body burn sugar instead of oxygen
lactic acid is produced That lactic
acid is what caused Santiagos lungs
to bleed

ROSS
How long does it take for the muscles
and other cells to begin burning
oxygen instead of sugar

STONE
Twenty to thirty minutes

ROSS
And what caused Santiagos muscles
and other cells to start burning
sugar

STONE
An ingested poison of some kind

KAFFEE
Your Honor we object at this point
The witness is speculating

ROSS
Commander Stone is an expert medical
witness in this courtroom his opinion
isnt considered speculation

KAFFEE
Commander Stone is an internist not
a criminologist and the medical
facts here are ultimately
inconclusive

RANDOLPH
A point which Im confident youll
illustrate to the jury under cross-
examination so Im sure you wont
mind if his opinion is admitted now

KAFFEE
Not at all sir Objection withdrawn

KAFFEE sits
ROSS
Doctor Stone did Willy Santiago die

of poisoning

STONE
Absolutely
ROSS
Are you aware that the lab report
and the coroners report showed no
traces of poison

STONE
Yes I am

ROSS
Then how do you justify --

STONE
There are literally dozens of toxins
which are virtually undetectable
both in the human body and on a
fabric The nature of the acidosis
is the compelling factor in this
issue

ROSS
Thank you sir

KAFFEE gets up

KAFFEE
Commander you testified that it
takes lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes
before it becomes lethal

STONE
Yes

KAFFEE
Let me ask you is it possible for a
person to have an affliction some
sort of condition which might in
the case of this person actually
speed up the process of acidosis
dramatically

STONE says nothing for a moment

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Commander is it possible

STONE
Certainly

KAFFEE
What might some of those conditions
be

STONE
(beat)
If a person had a coronary disorder
or a cerebral disorder the process
would be more rapid

KAFFEE
Commander if I had a coronary
condition and a perfectly clean rag
was placed in my mouth and the rag
was accidentally pushed too far down
is it possible that my cells would
continue burning sugar after the rag
was taken out

STONE
It would have to be a very serious
condition

KAFFEE
Is it possible to have a serious
coronary condition where the initial
warning signals were so mild as to
escape a physician during a routine
medical exam

STONE
Possibly There would still be
symptoms though

KAFFEE
What kind of symptoms

STONE
There are hundreds of symptoms of a --

KAFFEE
Chest pains

STONE
(beat)
Yes

KAFFEE
Shortness of breath

STONE
Yes

KAFFEE
Fatigue

STONE
Of course

KAFFEE has gone back to his table where JO has handed
him
some documents He shows then to STONE

KAFFEE
Doctor is this your signature

STONE
Yes it is

KAFFEE
This in an order for Private Santiago
to be put on restricted duty Would
you read your hand written remarks
at the bottom of the page please
sir

STONE
(reading)
Initial testing negative Patient
complains of chest pains shortness
of breath and fatigue Restricted
from running distances over five
miles for one week

KAFFEE
Commander isnt it possible that
Santiago had a serious coronary
condition and it was that condition
and not some mysterious poison that
caused the accelerated chemical
reaction

STONE
No I personally give the men a
physical examination every three
months And every three months Private
Santiago got a clean bill of health

KAFFEE

And thats why it had to be poison
right Commander Cause Lord knows
if you put a man with a serious
coronary condition back on duty with
a clean bill of health and that man
died from a heart related incident
youd have a lot to answer for
wouldnt you doctor

ROSS
Object Move to strike

RANDOLPH
Sustained Strike it

KAFFEE
No more questions judge

ROSS stands immediately

ROSS
Dr Stone youve held a license to
practice medicine for 21 years you
are Board Certified in Internal
Medicine you are the Chief of
Internal Medicine at a hospital which
serves over 8000 men In your
professional opinion was Willy
Santiago poisoned

Jo stands

JO
Your Honor we re-new our objection
to Commander Stones testimony and
ask that it be stricken from the
record And we further ask that the
Court instruct the jury to lend no
weight to this witnesss testimony

KAFFEE and SAM are dying but theyre trying to keep
their

poker-faces RANDOLPHS gonna try to be polite about
this

but he thought he made himself clear

RANDOLPH
The objections overruled counsel

JO
Sir the defense strenuously objects
and requests a meeting in chambers
so that his honor might have an
opportunity to hear discussion before
ruling on the objection

RANDOLPH
The objection of the defense has
been heard and overruled
SAM

JO
Exception

RANDOLPH
Noted The witness is an expert and
the court will hear his opinion

ROSS
Doctor in your expert professional
opinion was Willy Santiago poisoned

STONE
Yes

ROSS
Thank you sir I have no more
questions

RANDOLPH

Commander you may step down

ROSS
Please the Court while we reserve
the right to call rebuttal witnesses
if the need arises the Government
rests

RANDOLPH
Well stand in recess until ten-
hundred hours this Monday the 19th
at which time the defense will call
its first witness

RANDOLPH raps his gavel

SERGEANT AT ARMS

And the courtroom begins clearing out KAFFEE JO and
are packing up their various papers

SAM
I strenuously object Is that how it
works Objection Overruled No no
no no I strenuously object Oh
well if you strenuously object let
me take a moment to reconsider

JO
I got it on the record
SAM
You also got it in the jurys head
that were afraid of the doctor You
object once so they can hear you say
hes not a criminologist You keep
after it and it looks like this great
cross we did was just a bunch of
fancy lawyer tricks Its the
difference between paper law and
trial --

KAFFEE
Sam --

SAM
Christ you even had the Judge saying
Stone was an expert

KAFFEE
Sam she made a mistake Lets not
relive it

Sam starts to leave JO turns and says

JO
Why do you hate them so much

Sam stops and turns around

SAM
They beat up on a weakling and thats
all they did The rest is just
smokefilled coffee-house crap They
tortured and tormented a weaker kid
They didnt like him And they killed
him And why Because he couldnt

that it would actually matter to
this jury that the guys were given

HOWARD
Being late for platoon or company
meetings keeping his barracks in
disorder falling back on a run

KAFFEE
Have you ever received a code red

HOWARD
Yes sir We were doing seven man
assault drills and my weapon slipped
Its just cause it was over a hundred
degrees and my palms were sweaty and
Id forgot to use the resin like we
were taught

KAFFEE
And what happened

HOWARD
That night the guys in my squad threw
a blanket over me and took turns
punching me in the arm for five
minutes Then they poured glue on my
hands And it worked too cause I
aint never dropped my weapon since

KAFFEE
Was Private Santiago ever late for
platoon meetings

HOWARD
Yes sir

KAFFEE
Was his barracks ever in disorder

HOWARD
Yes sir

KAFFEE

August 6th receive a code red

HOWARD
No sir

KAFFEE

(beat)

Never

HOWARD
No sir

KAFFEE

You got a code red cause your palms
were sweaty Why didnt Santiago
this burden to his unit ever get
one
HOWARD
Dawson wouldnt allow it sir

KAFFEE

emotions take control of his professional skill

SAM will have files and documents ready to hand Kaffee

needs them
KAFFEE
Lt Kendrick in your opinion

Private Santiago a good marine

KENDRICK
Id say he was about average

KAFFEE

was
Lieutenant you signed three fitness
reports on Santiago On all three
reports you indicated a rating of
Below Average

KENDRICK
Yes Private Santiago was Below
Average I didnt see the need in
trampling on a mans grave

KAFFEE
We appreciate that but youre under
oath now and I think unpleasant as
it may be wed all just as soon
hear the truth

KENDRICK
Im aware of my oath

KAFFEEs handed some more files

KAFFEE
Lieutenant these are the last three
fitness reports you signed for Lance
Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey Downey
received three straight marks of
Exceptional Dawson received two
marks of Exceptional but on this
most recent report dated June 9th
of this year he received a rating
of Below Average Its this last
report that Id like to discuss for
a moment

KENDRICK
Thats fine

KAFFEE
Lance Corporal Dawsons ranking after
Infantry Training School was perfect
Records indicate that over half that
class has since been promoted to
full corporal while Dawson has
remained a lance corporal Was
Dawsons promotion held up because
of this last fitness report

KENDRICK
Im sure it was

KAFFEE
Do you recall why Dawson was given
such a poor grade on this report

KENDRICK
Im sure I dont I have many men in
my charge Lieutenant I write many
fitness reports

KAFFEE
Do you recall an incident involving
a PFC Curtis Barnes whod been found
stealing liquor from the Officers
Club

KENDRICK
Yes

KAFFEE
Did you report private Barnes to the
proper authorities

KENDRICK
I have two books at my bedside
Lieutenant the Marine Code of Conduct
and the King James Bible The only
proper authorities Im aware of are
my Commanding Officer Colonel Nathan
R Jessep and the Lord our God

KAFFEE
Lt Kendrick at your request I can
have the record reflect your lack of
acknowledgment of this court as a
proper authority

ROSS
Objection Argumentative

RANDOLPH
Sustained
(to KAFFEE)
Watch yourself counselor

KAFFEE
Did you report Private Barnes to
your superiors

KENDRICK
I remember thinking very highly of
Private Barnes and not wanting to
see his record tarnished by a formal
charge
KAFFEE
You preferred it to be handled within
the unit

KENDRICK
I most certainly did

KAFFEE
Lieutenant do you know what a Code
Red is

KENDRICK
Yes I do

KAFFEE
Have you ever ordered a code red

KENDRICK
No I have not

KAFFEE
Lieutenant did you order Dawson and
two other men to make sure that
Private Barnes receive no food or
drink except water for a period of
seven days

KENDRICK
Thats a distortion of the truth
Private Barnes was placed on barracks
restriction He was given water and
vitamin supplements and I assure
you that at no time was his health
in danger

KAFFEE
Im sure it was lovely for Private
Barnes but you did order the barracks
restriction didnt you And you did
order the denial of food

KENDRICK
Yes

KAFFEE
Wouldnt this form of discipline be
considered a code red

KENDRICK
(beat)
Not necessarily
KAFFEE
If I called the other 8000 men at
Guantanamo Bay to testify would
they consider it a Code Red

ROSS
Please the court the witness cant
possibly testify as to what 8000
other men would say We object to
this entire line of questioning as
argumentative and irrelevant badgering
of the witness

RANDOLPH
The Governments objection is
sustained Lt Kaffee and I would
remind you that youre now questioning
marine officer with an impeccable
service record

ROSS
Thank you judge

KAFFEE looks over at DAWSON They share a brief moment
before
KAFFEE turns back to KENDRICK

KAFFEE

Lieutenant was Dawson given a rating
of Below Average on this last fitness
report because you learned held been
sneaking food to Private Barnes

(to ROSS)
Not so fast

(to KENDRICK)
Lieutenant

KENDRICK
Corporal Dawson was found to be Below
Average because he committed a crime

KAFFEE
What crime did he commit
(beat)
Lieutenant Kendrick
(beat)
Dawson brought a hungry guy some
food What crime did he commit

KENDRICK
He disobeyed an order
KAFFEE
And because he did because he
exercised his own set of values
because he made a decision about the
welfare of a marine that was in
conflict with an order of yours he
was punished is that right

KENDRICK
Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order

KAFFEE
Yeah but it wasnt a order was it
After all its peacetime He wasnt
being asked to secure a hill or
advance on a beachhead I mean surely
a marine of Dawsons intelligence
can be trusted to determine on his
own which are the really important
orders and which orders might say
be morally questionable
(beat)
Lt Kendrick
(beat)
Can he Can Corporal Dawson determine
on his own which orders hes gonna
follow
(pause)

KENDRICK
No he can not

KAFFEE
A lesson he learned after the Curtis
Barnes incident am I right

KENDRICK
I would think so

KAFFEE
You know so dont you Lieutenant

ROSS
Object

RANDOLPH
Sustained

KAFFEE

Lieutenant Kendrick one final
question if you ordered Dawson to
give Santiago a code red
ROSS
-- please the court --

KENDRICK
I told those men not to touch
Santiago

KAFFEE

-- is it reasonable to think that he
wouldve disobeyed you again

ROSS
Lieutenant dont answer that

KAFFEE
You dont have to Im through

ROSS doesnt even wait before he says --

ROSS
Lieutenant Kendrick did you order
Corporal Dawson and Private Downey
to give Willy Santiaga code red

But KENDRICK isnt listening -- hes glaring at Kaffee

No I did not

that night Jessep was telling the
truth The six am flight was the
first plane out
KAFFEE lets the ball drop out of his hands

KAFFEE
Let me see that

EXT A MOTEL - NIGHT
A SEDAN with US MARSHALL stenciled on the door sits
front of one of the rooms and the two FEDERAL AGENTS
the car are reading the newspaper as KAFFEES CAR pulls
to them and KAFFEE jumps out
AGENT 1 sticks his head out the window and calls to
AGENT 1
Workin late lieutenant
KAFFEE pays no attention and bangs on MARKINSONs door
door opens and KAFFEE walks into
INT MOTEL ROOM
HE tosses the log book on the table
KAFFEE
There was no flight out at eleven
oclock What the fuck are you trying
to pull
MARKINSON
The first flight stateside left
Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived
at Andrews Airforce Base Maryland

at a few minutes past two

KAFFEE
Then why the hell isnt it listed in
the Tower Chiefs log

MARKINSON
Why the hell did you think it would
be

KAFFEE is silent And now it begins to sink in

KAFFEE
What are you telling me
(beat)
He fixed the log book

Setback Big setback

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Well maybe he can make it so a plane
didnt take off but I can sure as
hall prove that one landed Ill get
the log book from Andrews

MARKINSON says nothing But his face says that KAFFEE
was
born yesterday

KAFFEE
(continuing beat)
He made an entire flight disappear

MARKINSON

Nathan Jessep is about to be named
Director of Operations for the
National Security Council You dont
get to that position without knowing
how to side-step a few land mines

(beat)
And putting me on the stand isnt
gonna make him step on one

KAFFEE stares at him

Then shakes his head sighs and picks the log book up
off

the table and heads for the door

KAFFEE
Youre taking the stand Thursday

KAFFEE leaves

HOLD on MARKINSON
CuT TO
INT KAFFEES APARTMENT

KAFFEES APARTMENT later that night and SAM and JO have
just

Theres gotta be someone who can
testify to the flight A ground crew
member Someone

SAM
Do you have any idea how many planes
take off and land every day A kid
from the ground crew isnt gonna
remember a flight that landed four
weeks ago

KAFFEE
Forget the flight Well put Markinson
on the stand and well deal with
Jesseps refusal to transfer Santiago
and hell testify to the forged
transfer order Thatll be enough
That and Downeys testimony really
oughta be enough

And while we continue to HEAR Markinsons voice writing
the
letter we begin a SERIES OF SHOTS MARKINSON is
getting
into his class A dress uniform complete with medals
side

arm and military dress sabre
MARKINSON (V0O)
In a matter of time the trial of
the two man charged with your sons
death will be concluded and seven
men and two women whom youve never
met will try to offer you an
explanation as to why William is
dead For my part Ive done as much
as I can to bring the truth to light

MARKINSON is finished dressing He stands in the middle
of
the motel room

MARKINSON (V0O)
(continuing)
And the truth is this your son is
dead for only one reason I wasnt

EXT THE COURTROOM - DAY
Kaffee is at the end of his examination of Downey

KAFFEE
Private I want you to tell us one
last time Why did you go into Private
Santiagos room on the night of August
6th

DOWNEY
A code red was ordered by my platoon
commander Lt Jonathan James
Kendrick
KAFFEE
Thank you
(to ROSS)
Your witness

ROSS
Private for the week of 2 August
the switch log has you down at Post
39 is that correct

DOWNEY
Im sure it is sir they keep that
log pretty good

ROSS
How far is it from Post 39 to the
Windward barracks

DOWNEY
Its a ways sir its a hike

ROSS
About how far by jeep

DOWNEY
About ten fifteen minutes sir

ROSS
Have you ever had to walk it

DOWNEY
Yes sir That day sir Friday The
Pick-up Private -- sir thats what
we call the fella who drops us at
our posts and picks us up also
cause he can get girls in New York
City -- the Pick-up Private got a

flat

At the defense table KAFFEE poker-faced scribbles

something

down on a piece of paper and slides it to JO JO looks
at

it

Wheres he going with this JO scribbles And
hands it

back to KAFFEE

DOWNEY
(continuing)
-Right at 39 He pulled up and
blam A blowout-with no spare
The two of us had to double-time it
back to the barracks

ROSS

And if its ten or fifteen minutes
by jeep Im guessing it must be a
good hour by foot am I right

DOWNEY
Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat
sir

ROSS

Not bad Now you say your assault on
Private Santiago was the result of
an order that Lt Kendrick gave in
your barracks room at 1620

KAFFEE knows whats coming Theres nothing he can do

about
it And he cant lose his cool in front of the jury
DOWNEY
Yes sir
JO Helpless Panicked
ROSS
But you just said that you didnt
make it back to Windward Barracks
until 1645
DOWNEYs confused These are questions he hasnt been
asked
before
DOWNEY
Sir
ROSS

If you didnt make it back to your
barracks until 1645 then how could
you be in your room at 1620

DOWNEY
(pause)
You see sir there was a flat tire

ROSS
Private did you ever actually hear
Lt Kendrick order a Code Red

KAFFEEs world is falling down around him and theres
nothing
he can do about it And he knows it

DOWNEY
(pause)
No sir
Jo leaps to her feet
JO

Please the court Id like to request
a recess in order to confer with my
client

ROSS
Why did you go into Santiagos room

JO
The witness has rights

ROSS
The witness has been read his rights
commander

DOWNEY
(confused)
Hal

RANDOLPH
The question will be repeated

ROSS
Why did you go into Santiagos room

JO
Your honor --
DOWNEY
Hal
ROSS
Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do
it
Everyone is frozen
ROSS
(continuing)

He did didnt he Dawson told you

DOWNEY looks at DAWSON

DOWNEY
Hal

ROSS
Dont look at him

DOWNEY
Hal

DAWSON
Private Answer the Lieutenants
question

The room is still silent DOWNEY does something weve
seen him do before He straightens himself up and says
with the pride of a man who believes hes done the
thing

DOWNEY
Yes Lieutenant I was given an order
by my squad leader Lance Corporal
Harold W Dawson of the US Marine
Corps And I followed it

ROSS lets it hang He looks over at KAFFEE KAFFEE
meet his eyes

INT KAFFEES APARTMENT - NIGHT

JO and SAM are sitting in silence Its dark outside

JO
Where do you think he is

SAM doesnt know JO is beside herself and trying to
it together

JO
(continuing)
As far as Downey was concerned it
was an order from Kendrick It didnt
matter that he didnt hear it first
hand He doesnt distinguish between
the two

SAM understands but he doesnt say anything The door
opens
and KAFFEE walks in

JO
(continuing)
Danny Im sorry

KAFFEE seems to be in an incredibly normal mood

KAFFEE
Dont worry about it

JO
Sam and I were just talking about
how all we really have to do is call
some witnesses wholl talk about
implied orders or maybe we put
Downey back on the stand before we
get to Dawson

KAFFEE
Maybe if we work at it we can get
Dawson charged with the Kennedy
assassination

JO studies KAFFEE for a moment

JO
Are you drunk

KAFFEE
(a simple answer)
Pretty much Yeah

JO
(pause)
Ill make a pot of coffee We have a
long nights work ahead

KAFFEE
Shes gonna make coffee Thats nice
(beat)
He wasnt in his room
(Kaffees amazed)
He wasnt even there
(beat)
That was an important piece of
information dont you think
JO
(pause)
Danny it was just a setback Im
sorry But well fix it and then
move on to Markinson

KAFFEE
Markinsons dead

JO and SAM are frozen

KAFFEE says this with no particular feeling one way or

the
other

KAFFEE

(continuing)
You really gotta hand it to those
Federal Marshals boy

(he almost has to

laugh)
Its not like he hanged himself by
his shoelaces or slashed his wrists
with a concealed butter knife This
guy got into full dress uniform
stood in the middle of that room
drew a nickle plated pistol from his
holster and fired a bullet into his
mouth

Jo and SAM dont say anything

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Anyway since we seem to be out of
witnesses I thought Id drink a
little

JO
still think we can win

KAFFEE
Then maybe you should drink a little

JO

Look well go to Randolph in the
morning and make a motion for a
continuance 24 hours

KAFFEE
(beat)
Why would we want to do that
JO
To subpoena Colonel Jessep

KAFFEE
What

JO
Listen for a second --

KAFFEE
No

JO
Just hear me out --

KAFFEE
No I wont listen to you and I wont
hear you out Your passion is
comforting Jo Its also useless
Private Downey needed a trial lawyer
today

JO
(pause)
You chicken-shit Youre gonna use
what happened today as an excuse to
give up

KAFFEE
Its over

JO
Why did you ask Jessep for the
transfer order

KAFFEE
What are you --

JO
In Cuba Why did you ask Jessep for
the transfer order

KAFFEE
What does it matter --

JO

Why

KAFFEE
I wanted the damn transfer order
JO
Bullshit You couldve gotten it by
picking up the phone and calling any
one of a dozen departments at the
Pentagon You didnt want the transfer
order You wanted to see Jesseps
reaction when you asked for the
transfer order You had an instinct
And it was confirmed by Markinson
Now damnit lets put Jessep on the
stand and end this thing

KAFFEE
What possible good could come from
putting Jessep on the stand

JO
He told Kendrick to order the Code
Red

KAFFEE

He did Why didnt you say so
Thats qreat And of course you have
proof of that

JO

KAFFEE
Ah I keep forgetting You were sick
the day they taught law at law school

JO
You put him on the stand and you get
it from him

KAFFEE
Yes No problem We get it from him
(to SAM)
Colonel isnt it true that you
ordered the Code Red on Santiago

SAM
Look were all a little --

KAFFEE
Im sorry your times run out What
do we have for the losers Judge
Well for our defendants its a
lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth
And for defense counsel Kaffee Thats
right -- its -- a court -- martial
desk A

breathing

slams

the

couch

Yes Johnny after falsely accusing
a marine officer of conspiracy Lt
Kaffee will have a long and prosperous
career teaching typewriter maintenance
at the Rocco Columbo School for Women
Thank you for playing Should We or
Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of
the Galacticly Stupid
And with one motion he knocks everything from his
ton of papers books files etc falls to the floor
Theres dead silence Maybe just the sound of KAFFEE
after this exhausting outburst
Finally
JO
Im sorry I lost you your set of
steak knives
Jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out The door
behind her
KAFFEE walks into the kitchen without a word
SAM gets down on the floor and begins picking up all
stuff that Kaffee knocked off the desk

KAFFEE comes back in with a bottle of Jack Daniels

KAFFEE
Stop cleaning up

But Sam continues
KAFFEE
(continuing)
Sam Stop cleaning up
SAM stops and sits in a chair KAFFEE sits on the

You want a drink

SAM
SAM takes

KAFFEE

SAM
Dont do this to yourself

KAFFEE
Ill bet he is Ill bet he bores
the shit outta the neighbors and the
relatives Sam made Law Review
Hes got a big case hes making --
Hes arguing making an argument
(pause)
I think my father wouldve enjoyed
seeing me graduate from law school
(beat)
I think he wouldve liked that an
awful lot

SAM
Did I ever tell you that I wrote a
paper on your father in college

KAFFEE
Yeah

SAM
He was one of the best trial lawyers
ever

KAFFEE
Yes he was

SAM
And if I were Dawson and Downey and
I had a choice between you or your
father to represent me in this case
Id take you any day of the week and
twice on Sunday You should have
seen yourself thunder away at
Kendrick

KAFFEE
Would you put Jessep on the stand

SAM
No
CUT TO

doing

KAFFEEs

down

with

KAFFEE
You think my father wouldve

SAM
With the evidence weve got Not in
a million years But heres the thing --
and theres really no way of getting
around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee
nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel
for the defense in the matter of
US versus Dawson and Downey So
theres only one question What would
you do

We HOLD on the two of them for a moment then

EXT A SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

JO is walking through the night at a brisk pace Shes
her best not to fall apart

TWO HEADLIGHTS appear coming down the street and

CAR with SAM driving and KAFFEE riding shotgun slows
alongside JO KAFFEE rolls down his window

KAFFEE
Joanne

JO ignores them and keeps walking The car crawls along

JO starts walking faster
KAFFEE

INT KAFFEES APARTMENT - LATER - AFTERNOON
A nerf ball bounces off the wall
KAFFEE JO and SAM are sprawled out in the living room

hours now theyve been trying to come up with an idea
KAFFEEs mind seems to be on his basketball game

JO
I say we hit him with the phoney
transfer order

SAM
Whats the transfer order without a
witness

KAFFEE
We have a witness

SAM
A dead witness

KAFFEE
And in the hands of a lesser attorney
thatd be a problem

SAM
Look at this Last night he was
swimming in his Jack Daniels now he
can leap tall buildings in a single
bound

KAFFEE
Im getting my second wind Siddown
Both of you

He sees that SAM and JO were already sitting down

KAFFEE

(continuing)
Good

(beat)
Jessep told Kendrick to order a code
red Kendrick did and our clients
followed the order The cover-up
isnt our case To win Jessep has
to tell the jury that he ordered the
code red

SAM
And you think you can got him to
just say it

KAFFEE
I think he wants to say it I think
hes pissed off that hes gotta hide
from us I think he wants to say
that he made a command decision and
thats the end of it He eats
breakfast 80 yards away from 4000
Cubans who are trained to kill hin
and no ones gonna tell him how to
run his base Least of all the pushy
broad the smart Jew and the Harvard
clown I need to shake him and put
him on the defensive

SAM and JO are silent for a moment

SAM
Thats it Thats the plan

KAFFEE
Thats the plan

SAM
Youre gonna trip Jessep and hes
gonna confess

KAFFEE
Im not gonna trip him Im gonna
lead him right where hes dying to
go

officers is that right

JESSEP
Yes

KAFFEE
The Executive Officer Lt Jonathan
Kendrick and the Company Commander
Captain Matthew Markinson

JESSEP
Yes

KAFFEE
And at present Captain Markinson is
dead is that right

ROSS
Objection Id like to know just
what defense counsel is implying

KAFFEE
Im implying simply that at present
Captain Markinson is not alive

ROSS
Surely Colonel Jessep doesnt need
to appear in this courtroom to confirm
that information

KAFFEE
I just wasnt sure if the witness
was aware that two days ago Captain
Markinson took his own life with a
-45 caliber pistol

And from the back of the room SAM enters Hes

escorting

two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms SAM shows
the

AIRMEN to a seat near the front and takes his place at
the

defense table
Over this we HEAR --

RANDOLPH (0S)
The witness is aware the Court is
aware and now the jury is aware We
thank you for bringing this to our
attention Move on Lieutenant

SAM scribbles something on a piece of paper KAFFEE

walks

over looks at the paper on which are wrttten two
names

Cecil OMalley and Anthony Perez then turns back to
RANDOLPH

KAFFEE
Yes sir Colonel at the time of
this meeting you gave Lt Kendrick
an order is that right

JESSEP
I told Kendrick to tell his men that
Santiago wasnt to be touched

KAFFEE
And did you give an order to Captain
Markinson as well

JESSEP
I ordered Markinson to have Santiago
transferred off the base immediately

KAFFEE
Why

JESSEP
I felt that his life might be in
danger once word of the letter got
out

KAFFEE
Grave danger

JESSEP
Is there another kind

KAFFEE holds up a document from his table

KAFFEE
We have the transfer order that you
and Markinson co-signed ordering
that Santiago be lifted on a flight
leaving Guantanamo at six the next
morning Was that the first flight
off the bass
JESSEP
The six am flight was the first
flight off the base

KAFFEE nods and decides to move on

JESSEP steals a quick glance at the two AIRMEN sitting
out
in the courtroom

KAFFEE
Colonel you flew up to Washington
early this morning is that right

JESSEP
Yes

KAFFEE
I notice youre wearing your Class A
appearance in dress uniform for court
today

JESSEP
(continuing)
As are you Lieutenant

KAFFEE
Did you wear that uniform on the

ROSS

KAFFEE

The defense didnt have an opportunity
to depose this witness your honor

latitude

fq

RANDOLPH
A very little latitude

KAFFEE
Colonel

JESSEP
I wore fatigues on the plane

KAFFEE
And you brought your dress uniform
with you
JESSEP

Pairs of camouflage pants 6
camouflage shirts 2 pairs of boots
1 pair of brown shoes 1 pair of
tennis shoes 8 khaki tee-shirts 2
belts 1 sweater --

ROSS
Please the Court is there a question
anywhere in our future

RANDOLPH
Lt Kaffee I have to --

KAFFEE
Im wondering why Santiago wasnt
packed

That landed On the JURY RANDOLPH ROSS

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Ill tell you what well get back
to that one in a minute

JO hands KAFFEE the computer printout

KAFFEE
(continuing)
This is a record of all telephone
calls made from your base in the
past 24 hours After being subpoenaed
to Washington you made three calls

Handing Jessep the printout --

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Ive highlighted those calls in
yellow Do you recognize those
numbers

JESSEP
I called Colonel Fitzhughes in
Quantico Va I wanted to let him
know Id be in town The second call
was to set up a meeting with
Congressman Ramond of the House Armed
Services Committee and the third
call was to my sister Elizabeth

KAFFEE
Why did you make that call sir

JESSEP
I thought she might like to have
dinner tonight

ROSS
Judge --

RANDOLPH
Im gonna put a stop to this now
Jos handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of
letters

KAFFEE
Your honor these are the telephone
records from GITMO for August 6th
And these are 14 letters that Santiago
wrote in nine months requesting in
fact begging for a transfer
(to JESSEP)
Upon hearing the news that he was
finally getting his transfer Santiago
was so excited that do you know how
many people he called Zero Nobody
Not one call to his parents saying
he was coming home Not one call to
a friend saying can you pick me up
at the airport He was asleep in his
bed at midnight and according to
you he was getting on a plane in six
hours yet everything he owned was
hanging neatly in his closet and
folded neatly in his footlocker You
were leaving for one day and you
packed a bag and made three phone
calls Santiago was leaving for the
rest of his life and he hadnt called
a soul and he hadnt packed a thing
Can you explain that The fact is
there was no transfer order Santiago
wasnt going anywhere isnt that
right Colonel

ROSS
bject Your Honor its obvious
hat Lt Kaffees intention this
orning is to smear a high ranking
arine officer in the desperate hope
hat the mere appearance of
mpropriety will win him points with
he jury Its my recommendation
ir that Lt Kaffee receive an
fficial reprimand from the bench
nd that the witness be excused with
he Courts deepest apologies

BBdtoO

P ON dtE

RANDOLPH ponders this a moment

RANDOLPH
(pause)
Overruled
ROSS
Your honor --

RANDOLPH
The objections noted

KAFFEE
(beat)
Colonel

Jesseps smiling
and now he cant help but let out a short laugh

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Is this funny sir

JESSEP
No Its not Its tragic

KAFFEE
Do you have an answer

JESSEP

Absolutely My answer is I dont
have the first damn clue Maybe he
was an early morning riser and he
liked to pack in the nq And maybe
he didnt have any friends Im an
educated man but Im afraid I cant
speak intelligently about the travel
habits of William Santiago What I
do know is that he was set to leave
the base at 0600 Now are these really
the questions I was called here to
answer Phone calls and footlockers
Please tell me youve got something
more Lieutenant Please tell me
theres an ace up your sleeve These
two marines are on trial for their
lives Please tell me their lawyer
hasnt pinned their hopes to a phone
bill

(beat)
Do you have any other questions for
me counselor

The courtroom is silenced Jesseps slammed the door

KAFFEE looks around the room sees that the world is
waiting
for him to do something

RANDOLPH
Lt Kaffee

KAFFEE says nothing He glances over to AIRMEN OMALLEY
and
PEREZ

RANDOLPH
(continuing)
Lieutenant do you have anything
further for this witness
KAFFEE doesnt respond JESSEP gets up to leave
JESSEP
(standing)
Thanks Danny I love Washington

And JESSEP starts to leave but hes stopped by --

KAFFEE
Excuse me I didnt dismiss you

JESSEP turns around

JESSEP
I beg your pardon

KAFFEE
Im not through with my examination
Sit down

JESSEP
Colonel

KAFFEE

Whats that

JESSEP
(to RANDOLPH)
Id appreciate it if he addressed me
as Colonel or Sir I believe Ive
earned it

RANDOLPH
Defense counsel will address the
witness as Colonel or Sir

JESSEP
(to RANDOLPH)
I dont know what the hell kind of
an outfit youre running here

RANDOLPH
And the witness will address this
Court as Judge or Your Honor Im
quite certain Ive earned it Take
your seat Colonel

Jessep goes back to the stand

JESSEP
(continuing)
What would you like to discuss now
My favorite color

KAFFEE
Colonel the six am flight was
the first one off the base

JESSEP
Yes

KAFFEE
There wasnt a flight that left seven
hours earlier and landed at Andrews
Airforce Base at 2 am

RANDOLPH
Lieutenant I think weve covered
this havent we

KAFFEE gets the two log books from his table as well as
the
piece of paper that SAM scribbled on

KAFFEE
Your Honor these are the Tower
Chiefs Logs for both Guantanamo Bay
and Andrews Airforce Base The
Guantanamo log lists no flight that
left at eleven pm and the Andrews
log lists no flight that landed at 2
am Id like to admit them as Defense
Exhibits A and B

RANDOLPH
I dont understand Youre admitting
evidence of a flight that never
existed

KAFFEE
of

We believe it did sir

(glancing at the paper

then motioning to

the AIRMEN)
Defensell be calling Airman Cecil
OMalley and Airman Anthony Perez
They were working the ground crew at
Andrews at two am on the seventh

ROSS
Your Honor these men werent on the
list Rebuttal witnesses Your Honor
called specifically to refute
testimony offered under direct
examination

If you looked closely at JESSEP you could see a drop

sweat

RANDOLPH
Ill allow the witnesses

JESSEP
This is ridiculous

KAFFEE
Colonel a moment ago --

JESSEP
Check the Tower Logs for christs
sake

KAFFEE

Well get to the airmen in just a
minute sir A moment ago said that
you ordered Kendrick to order his
men not to touch Santiago

JESSEP
Thats right

KAFFEE
And Kendrick was clear on what you
wanted

JESSEP
Crystal

KAFFEE

Any chance Kendrick ignored the order
JESSEP
Ignored the order

KAFFEE
Any chance he just forgot about it

JESSEP
No

KAFFEE
Any chance Kendrick left your office
and said The old mans wrong

JESSEP
No

KAFFEE
When Kendrick spoke to the platoon
and ordered them not to touch
Santiago any chance they ignored
him

JESSEP
Have you ever spent time in an
infantry unit son

KAFFEE
No sir

JESSEP
Ever served in a forward area

KAFFEE
No sir

JESSEP
Ever put your life in another mans
hands ask him to put his life in
yours

KAFFEE
No sir

JESSEP
We follow orders son We follow
orders or people die Its that
simple Are we clear

KAFFEE
Yes sir

JESSEP
Are we clear

KAFFEE
Crystal

KAFFEE speaks with the quiet confidence that comes from
knowing youre about to drop your opponents

KAFFEE

(continuing beat)
Colonel I have just one more question
before I call Airman OMalley and
Airman Perez If you gave an order
that Santiago wasnt to be touched
and your orders are always followed
then why would he be in danger why
would it be necessary to transfer
him off the base

And JESSEP has no answer
Nothing

He sits there and for the first time seems to be
lost

JESSEP
Private Santiago was a sub-standard
marine He was being transferred off
the base because --

KAFFEE
But thats not what you said You
said he was being transferred because
he was in grave danger

JESSEP
(pause)
Yes Thats correct but --

KAFFEE
You said He was in danger I said
Grave danger You said --

JESSEP
Yes I recall what --

KAFFEE
I can have the Court Reporter read
back your --

JESSEP
I know what I said I dont need it
read back to me like Im a damn --

KAFFEE
Then why the two orders
(beat)
Colonel
(beat)
Why did you --

JESSEP
Sometimes men take matters into their
own hands

KAFFEE
No sir You made it clear just a
moment ago that your men never take
matters into their own hands Your
men follow orders or people die So
Santiago shouldnt have been in any
danger at all should he have
Colonel

Everyones sweating now Everyone but KAFFEE

Jessep is

JESSEP
You little bastard

ROSS
Your Honor I have to ask for a recess
to --

KAFFEE
d like an answer to the question
Judge

RANDOLPH
The Courtll wait for answer

fq

KAFFEE
f Kendrick told his men that Santiago
wasnt to be touched then why did
he have to be transferred

looking at OMALLEY and PEREZ

KAFFEE
(continuing)
Colonel

JESSEP says nothing
KAFFEE
(continuing)
Kendrick ordered the code red didnt
he Because thats what you told
Kendrick to do

ROSS
Object

RANDOLPH
Counsel

KAFFEE will plow through the objections of ROSS and the
admonishments of RANDOLPH

KAFFEE
And when it went bad you cut these
guys loose

ROSS
Your Honor --

RANDOLPH
Thatll be all counsel

KAFFEE
You had Markinson sign a phony
transfer order --

ROSS
Judge --

KAFFEE
You doctored the log books

ROSS
Damnit Kaffee

KAFFEE
Ill ask for the forth time You
ordered --

JESSEP

You want answers

KAFFEE
I think Im entitled to them

JESSEP
You want answers

KAFFEE
I want the truth

JESSEP
You cant handle the truth

And nobody moves

JESSEP

(continuing)
Son we live in a world that has
walls And those walls have to be
guarded by men with guns Whos gonna
do it You You Lt Weinberg I
have a greater responsibility than
you can possibly fathom You weep
for Santiago and you curse the
marines You have that luxury You
have the luxury of not knowing what
I know That Santiagos death while
tragic probably saved lives And my
existence while grotesque and
incomprehensible to you saves lives

(beat)
You dont want the truth Because
deep down in places you dont talk
about at parties you want me on
that wall You need me there

(boasting)
We use words like honor code
loyalty we use these words as the

backbone to a life spent defending
something You use em as a punchline
(beat)
I have neither the time nor the
inclination to explain myself to a
man who rises and sleeps under the
blanket of the very freedom I provide
then questions the manner in which I
provide it Id prefer you just said
thank you and went on your way
Otherwise I suggest you pick up a
weapon and stand a post Either way
I dont give a damn what you think
youre entitled to

KAFFEE
(quietly)
Did you order the code red

JESSEP
(beat)
I did the job you sent me to do
KAFFEE
Did you order the code red

JESSEP
(pause)
Youre goddamn right I did

Silence From everyone RANDOLPH ROSS the MPs

theyre
all frozen JO and SAM are likewise JESSEP seems
strangely
quietly relieved KAFFEE simply takes control of the
room
now
KAFFEE

Jack
ROSS looks at KAFFEE then JESSEP then nods his head

RANDOLPH
The Sergeant at Arms will take the

The SERGEANT AT ARMS begins leading the JURORS out of
the

JESSEP

No one will say anything until the jurors are out of
the
room

JESSEP
(continuing to captain)
Captain what the hells going on I

RANDOLPH

The MPs are tentative Theyve never heard a marine
colonel

referred to as the prisoner before They sure as hell
have

never been asked to guard one

ROSS
Guard the prisoner

JESSEP
What the hell --

ROSS
Colonel Jessep you have the right
to remain silent Any statement you
do make can be used against you in a
trial by court-martial or other
judicial or administrative proceeding
You have the right

ROSS continues reading JESSEP his rights over --
JESSEP

job)

JESSEP

KAFFEE

shakes

KAFFEE stays on JESSEP a moment longer

for the three MPs whove leapt in to restrain

JESSEP
(continuing to Kaffee)
Im gonna tear your eyes right outta

your head and piss in your dead skull

You fucked with the wrong marine

ROSS is done reading JESSEP his rights

ROSS
Colonel Jessep do you understand
those rights as I have just read

JESSEP
I saved lives That boy was -- there
was a weak link I saved lives you

The courtroom is silent from Jesseps outburst

JESSEP
(continuing)
You fuckin people

nation

All you did was weaken a country
