ELIZA
Good one Grampa
HAROLD
Maureen wont even walk that path
anymore She was mauled by a
buck

DANNY
A buck In the Berkshires

HAROLD
A male deer

DANNY

HAROLD
Maybe it was a big dog or a small
boy In her indomitable way she
survived with just a nasty
raspberry on her knee but her
wallet was gone

He takes Elizas hand and leads her further inside They
pass the living room where the TV is on the baseball game

HAROLD
The Mets just relinquished the
lead
DANNY HAROLD

HAROLD (0S)

Her hair is graying and she doesnt dye it She wears a
blazer with an abstract pin on the lapel and big hanging
earrings and glasses She dresses how she probably dressed
twenty-five years ago

JEAN

in dog shit

She hugs Eliza and Danny

JEAN

ELIZA JEAN

ELIZA

JEAN
Dad keeps saying he wishes he
hadn’t retired now so that you
could take his class If that’s
even allowed at Bard

ELIZA DANNY
I couldn’t make sculpture Shes very excited which Im
that’s too intimidating trying not to take
personally Im bad with
transitions
JEAN

You dont leave the house There
are no transitions

(whispers to Danny)
Maureens plastered

HAROLD
(yelling up the stairs)
Maureen every one is here Come

(to the group)
Shes making shark

ELIZA HAROLD
I dont think Ive ever had Maureens a real gourmand
shark

JEAN
(meeting Elizas eyes)
Well youre in for a treat
HAROLD
(loud whisper to Danny)
Maureens been sober for six
weeks

DANNY
Oh OK

HAROLD
I tell her I dont like you when

different person

(to Eliza)

I made her a deal I told her if
you stop drinking well get a
dog

INT DINING ROOM

CLOSE A bowl of bouillabaisse All the clam and mussel

shells are still closed shut A fork picks through the

uncooked slab of shark

HAROLD (0S)
This is very handsome shellfish
Maureen

Eliza makes a face
MAUREEN

The Dad says youre going to study
film at college

The family sits around a wooden table Maureen
looks plastered She wears an Indian patterned caftan and

50s

a big bulky necklace she probably got at a craft fair

ELIZA
Yeah

MAUREEN
That seems to be what everybody is
doing these days I think the Dad
hoped you’d follow in his
footsteps and take sculpture--

HAROLD
No I think it’s good she’s doing
her own thing Since Clarence had
his stroke and I retired the art
department at Bard has really
suffered

DANNY
Shes quite a good editor

Danny is trying to pry open a clam shell Eliza moves the
food around on her plate Harold eats quickly and messily

HAROLD
So now we have a sculptor and a
filmmaker in the family

ELIZA
(re Danny)
And a musician

HAROLD
And an accountant which sounds
uninteresting but Matthews in
fact the only one in the family
whos figured out how to make
money Sign of the times

He laughs at his own remark

HAROLD
I would have thought wed have had
more artists in this family

ELIZA
What about Dad

Eliza looks over to Danny who listens closely perhaps
waiting to be mentioned himself

DANNY
(finally)
Im artistic

HAROLD
Matthew showed interest in fine
art and Danny had musical talent
But Matthew was also talented
musically and a wonderful mimic

He looks at Jean and hesitates

HAROLD
Jean you showed interest in
photography

JEAN
At Montessori yeah In my office
at Xerox Im known as the resident
auteur I make funny movies for my
co-workers birthdays

ELIZA
They’re really good

Danny finally breaks open his clam shell He meets eyes
with Eliza She slowly shakes her head at him Dont do
it He drops the shell back into the bowl nodding OK

MAUREEN
We have no idea what Jean does at
Xerox
JEAN MAUREEN

hand on Elizas back)

none

MAUREEN

but OK
HAROLD
(excitedly)
Matthews coming out from the
coast in a few weeks He

corresponded with me about meeting

Danny looks up surprised

DANNY
Matt is

Danny absentmindedly puts some shark in his mouth and then
takes it right back out

MAUREEN
He has some wealthy clients who
are coming here on Sunday to look
at the Dads work

DANNY
Matt does

HAROLD
Apparently theyre both admirers
of mine

MAUREEN
We never hear from him and then
suddenlypoof

HAROLD

DANNY

Life
HAROLD

Hes only here for a day to see a
client and he wants to see me
during that time Eliza have
more shark Maureen give my
granddaughter more shark

Maureen heaps more shark on Elizas plate

MAUREEN
You kids dont eat

Jean starts clearing Maureen and Danny help her Eliza
remains with her grandfather pretending to eat her shark
We MOVE between the adjacent kitchen and the dining room

JEAN
Its amazing how much Matthews
clients make when you think about
what a teacher or nurse earns--

HAROLD
I think I would have had greater
success if I had been more
fashionable

MAUREEN
Well you were always out of step
with the times

HAROLD
Thats true I was a vanguard
LJ Shapiro said that about me

Jean reenters from the kitchen bringing out coffee cups
JEAN
You know LJs having a
retrospective at MOMA

HAROLD
(didnt know)
Is he LJ was always very
political Hes not untalented
but hes a very skillful operator

MAUREEN (0S)
You didnt play the game

HAROLD
You know LJ and I showed
together at Paula Cooper in the
late 60s And believe it or not
I was the headliner

Danny still distracted by discussion of Matthew says
Jean

DANNY
Do you think I should e-mail Matt
about his visit

JEAN
Why not

DANNY
I dont want to be presumptuous

JEAN
Hes your brother Dan

DANNY
(shrugs )
Half
Maureen reenters
MAUREEN

Isnt that when the Whitney bought
a piece of yours

HAROLD
Yes They were going to buy more
work too but Bernie my dealer at
the time didnt like the deal I
probably shouldnt have listened
to him

to

DANNY
(continuing to Jean)
I dont know he didnt respond
the last time I reached out

Harold pries open another clam and eats it Eliza makes a
disgusted face to herself

JEAN
When I called and wrote the
Whitney about it they couldnt
find it

HAROLD
Its there

JEAN
They cant find it

HAROLD
Jean damnit they have the work

JEAN
(chastised)
OK OK

Jean takes Elizas full plate rescuing her from eating
anything more and says in her ear

JEAN
Its lost

INT HALLWAY

We hear family conversation from the other room Danny
turns the knob on the bathroom door It opens and Maureen
immediately comes out wearing rose tinted glasses but
where you can see her eyes

DANNY
Ohsorry

Maureen mumbles something Danny enters

INT BATHROOM

Danny flushes A strange rattling sound He lifts up the
back of the toilet Inside bouncing around the chain are
several small pint-size liquor bottles

INT LIVING ROOM

Danny and Eliza sit at an upright piano Danny plays the
top keys Eliza the bottom

DANNY
This is a MeyerowitzMeyerowitz
composition

ELIZA
We wrote it when I was nine

CUT TO CLOSE on a book of Harolds work

HAROLD (0S)

The work looks stunning all
together like this Danny you
made this

Harold sits with Jean on a old corduroy couch They eat
cookies Jean made Harold hands the book to Maureen

MAUREEN DANNY
(reading) Jean and I did it yes
Harold Meyerowitz A
Retrospective
JEAN

You send in the pictures and they
make it for you

DANNY
(from the piano)
Oh Dad Jean and I spoke with a
woman at the museum at Bard--

Danny looks at Jean who nods for him to continue

HAROLD
Is that Hilma Federman

DANNY
Hilma yes And theres some
interest at Bard in doing a show--

MAUREEN
Thats the least they can do for
you after all those years youve
given them

Maureen randomly clears a plate and leaves the room

DANNY
I think with Eliza going this fall
and your history there as a
teacher we have a good shot--

HAROLD
Danny make sure Hilma sees the
book A retrospective at this
point would be a real feather in
my cap And I think bring
attention to the new work

Jean looks at Danny who stops playing

DANNY JEAN
Well the thing is Dadit Bard Faculty
would be part of a group
show
HAROLD
A group show No Thats
essentially an insult I think

Hilmas angry because I voted
against her chairmanship Tell
Hilma No

DANNY
Hilma hasnt offered it yet

HAROLD
Well when she does tell her No

Danny continues playing Eliza and Danny finish the song
JEAN
That sounded great Youve gotten
good Eliza
ELIZA
(putting her head on
Dannys shoulder)
I had a good teacher
EXT HAROLDS HOUSE BLEECKER STREET NIGHT

Eliza waits with Danny outside the house

DANNY

ELIZA

Dad it was raw The rice was
hard the shell fish was closed

Danny removes a piece of trash thats blown up on the walk
He walks uneasily over to a trash can and chucks it

ELIZA

sitting I need to stretch it

ELIZA

ELIZA
I still havent wrapped my mind
around it You not being

with Dad while Maureen’s away You

with him growing up After he left
my mom and married Julia and they
had Mattwe didn’t see so much of
him Its an opportunity to get
closer now

ELIZA
Its nice you and Jean are getting
him this show

DANNY
I know its just a college show
but I think it could really put
him back on the map The work is
good and deserves more exposure

A car has pulled up at the corner A bearded guy
behind the wheel

DANNY
Hey Marcus

MARCUS

DANNY

Youre a truly wonderful girl

opens the fridge and takes out a carton of orange juice and
pours himself a glass He drinks and spits it across the
kitchen floor

DANNY
Oh God

I just realized is possible

HAROLD

belonging to Maureen’s late ex-
husband

INT MOMA LOBBY DAY

pretty women consult iPads

DANNY

INT MOMA RECEPTION AREA

Danny again assesses the very non-tuxedo crowd and
attempts to wander the premises as unself-consciously as
possible He nervously hums an indecipherable tune

Amongst the sculptures and old high 8 video of a young
girl (Loretta) on monitors he sees a woman 40s ina
simple elegant dress

INT MOMA GALLERY ROOM

Harold has a red wine now LJ drinks his Zubrowka and is
approached throughout by well-wishers

HAROLD
The work looks good I dont know
that the presentation is helping

Danny laughs
DANNY
Yeah I secretly hoped that about
Eliza but unfortunately she seems

Loretta laughs Danny smiles broadly pleased shes so

HAROLD (0S)

Danny startles Harold is right behind him

DANNY
Dad--
LORETTA

Loretta hugs him and kisses him warmly on the cheek

HAROLD

GUEST

Loretta is swarmed by more well-wishers

HAROLD
(to Danny)
I want to go

DANNY
(trying to keep it light)
Just a few more minutes roomie

HAROLD
Im leaving

Harold hurries toward the EXIT Danny looks at Loretta
who is distracted by the bigger group--

Danny gazes toward the EXIT where his father is wrestling
open one of the big glass doors Danny hesitates

DANNY
Um Loretta--

She doesnt hear him He politely waits for a moment

DANNY
Loretta

She smiles at him still talking to the group

DANNY
(strangely pantomiming
leaving)
I have to go

LORETTA
Oh no You sure You guys

DANNY

She kisses him on the cheek

DANNY LORETTA

DANNY

Danny hesitates She turns back to her group Danny knows

hes blown it He hurries after his father
EXT MOMA5TH AVENUE NIGHT

Danny is hit by a blast of cold air His father is gone
He looks around to see

Harold running toward 5th Avenue

Danny takes off after his father but with his limp and the
jump Harold has already gotten hes quite a bit behind

DANNY
Dad
Danny turns onto 5th Avenue Harold is crossing the
street Danny hurries dodging traffic Horns
DANNY
Dad

Finally Danny catches up to him out of breath

DANNY
(out of breath)
Dad Did you hear me

Harold doesnt answer Danny holds his hip

DANNY
Shit

They slowly walk together in silence Then Harold lets it
rip

HAROLD
Ultimately LJ is a popular but
minor artist Theres a
superficial bravura but theres no
unconscious no discovery

(MORE )

HAROLD (CONTD)
I know you like the bears but its
a reshuffling of obnoxious cliches
like listening to music played
slightly off-key

DANNY
I didnt get to see it

HAROLD
And the video work is embarrassing -
- Ive never forgiven LJ for
using Loretta in those pieces You
dont do that to a child And its
a disturbing commentary on the
culture that truly ordinary work
made mostly by his assistants gets
reverent reviews by critics who
ought to know better Hes a
talented pretentious enigma

Silence as they continue to walk past the bright lights of
5th Avenue stores and office buildings

DANNY
It was nice to see Loretta

HAROLD
(brightening)
She was very happy to see me She
gave me quite a kiss

DANNY
I did well I was pretty funny I
think I didnt get her number or

anything Maybe I can get LJs
e-mail from you--

HAROLD
I don’t feel comfortable giving it
out Maybe there’s a work one

DANNY
OK

HAROLD
I met Sigourney Weaver who was very
friendly She said Hi Im
Sigourney I said Hi Im
Harold

Danny waits but there isnt more He looks for a cab

HAROLD
Have you thought about getting a
job
Danny shrugs
HAROLD

Youve essentially never worked in
your life

Danny nods

HAROLD
I think youd feel better about
yourself
Danny nods
HAROLD

Do you ever think about playing
music again

Danny shrugs

HAROLD
Maureen will be back next Thursday
and you should think about where
youre going to live I mean you
can stay a while longer but--

INT HAROLDS HOUSE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

A clock reads 940 Danny still in his tux walks by the

He eats a sandwich and makes up the living room couch with
a sheet and pillow Harold appears in the doorway He

MATTHEW
TEXT
Matthew had just arrived on the red-eye from LA

INT RANDY’S APARTMENT
The BLAST of JACKHAMMERS

CUT TO An apartment wall comes crashing down The white
plaster and dust billows and clouds the room

As it settles we reveal Matthew Meyerowitz mid-40s
crouched and holding his ears his face still clenched in
anticipation of the explosion He wears a suit and tie

The man next to him Randy 30 is dressed in a white V-
neck and white karate pants with white wrestling sneakers

RANDY
Is that OK Is that OK Is
that OK that that just happened

MATT
It’s OK
(to a workman)
Right

The guy says nothing

RANDY
I dont know Im scared Matt
Randy walks through the rooms Matthew following him

Workmen swirl around them under them above them

RANDY
These guys are six months behind

Matt hands him a piece of paper

MATT
Thats why Im here I put
together a document that
anticipates where youll be at the
end of the year vis a vis the
overages

RANDY
(takes the sheet)
Oh for Christ Really Have we
already spent this much

MATT
Thats the first page

RANDY
(turns it around)
Suck a dick Oh God Really

Another crashing sound Matt looks around

MATT
The change orders are adding up
We didnt budget for the salt
water pool

RANDY
(smiling)
But were getting a salt water
pool In New York City Matty
Every time I think of that pool I
do a Snoopy dance

He does a Snoopy dance

MATT
Below youll see I made a list of
things I think you should consider
cutting back on

Randy looks at the list

RANDY
(jumping up and down)
No The steam room makes me so
happy

MATT
(consulting the sheet)
You realize you have a steam room
and a sauna

Randy nods innocently

MATT

We have to make some decisions

(wiping plaster dust off

his shoulder)
Its too late to take out the
sauna but the Italian marble --
the wine vault alone is a hundred
grand

RANDY
You look tired

Matts phone rings

MATT
I can’t sleep on the red-eye

RANDY
Lets get you a coffee

Matt checks his phone Dad

RANDY
I’m glad you’re here Matt

MATT
I’m not leaving until we’ve
figured this out--

Matt doesnt answer his phone and they step into a shell of
a room thats sealed off with plastic More workmen
Hammering Plaster dust drifts down on them

RANDY
(marveling)
There are different people here
every day

The coffee machine sits alone atop a folding table Randy
pours the beans into the grinder and presses the button

RANDY
(shouting over the
grinding)
Hows your kid

MATT
Good Im in a fight with my wife
right now but
(re the sheet)

Randy I dont want to sound
alarmist but youre not going to
be able to sustain your lifestyle
if things continue like this

Randy frowns like a child

MATT
And youre not going on tour any
time soon --

Randy hands Matt a coffee Matt sips the coffee and
smiles

RANDY MATT
Right Its nice

RANDY
Its my own espresso bean SEE
Im doing everything I can to make
a buck The coffee will pay for
the pool

MATT
That might be too much pressure to
put on the coffee--

Matts phone rings again He looks at it

MATT
Here’s what we’re going to do
We’re going to get you the pool

RANDY
Yes

MATT
But not this year We’re going to
rent out the bottom floor which is
zoned commercial anyway and we’1l
get a tenant for the second floor

RANDY MATT
But can’t I afford-- The income from the rentals
will cover the real estate
taxes and you’1ll live on the
top two floors in the
meantime Everything else
you can have

MATT

Let me just

(answering)
Hello

RANDY
Coffee makes me so happy

A saw screams loudly in the other room Matt plugs one ear
with his finger and goes to the window

EXT WILLIAMSBURG RESTAURANT INTERCUT

Harold stands outside a restaurant He wears a camel
colored blazer with a black turtleneck and baggy slacks A
denim flat cap on his head He holds a poster roll and
some envelopes and folders under his arm He still has a
slight bruise on the side of his face from his fall
Theyre jack-hammering in the street next to him

notebook He turns to Matt and says decisively

Matt puts his hand on Randy’s shoulder

RANDY
(re the phone)
Everything OK

MATT

MATT

No now its easy When I was

Randy fishes into his pants-pocket and retrieves two loose
different sized pills He picks some additional lint out
of his palm

RANDY
--one brings you up and the other
brings you down but Im not
totally certain which is which

MATT
You have a guess

RANDY

while

He hands them to Matt Matt puts it in his breast pocket

RANDY

envelopes and papers and the Vuarnet sunglasses Matt
frowns

HAROLD

Harold starts walking away Matt hesitates

MATT
OK let me think

A man 30s Gabe is trying to get Matts attention from a
table inside the restaurant Matthew indicates for him to
follow them

Matthew and Harold walk There seems to be construction
everywhere they go They pass wild-posting of ads for LJ
Shapiros retrospective at MOMA

HAROLD
Not too far because at three I
have to put money in the meter

Gabe sprinting catches up to them

HAROLD
This man is treading right on my
heels

MATT

No Dad hes with me This is
Gabe he works at my firm in New
York

Gabe joins them on the sidewalk

GABE
Nice to meet you Mr Meyerowitz

Gabe reaches out to shake Harolds hand but Harold doesnt
take it

MATT
I thought Gabe could join us for
part of lunch His specialty is
in estate planning--

HAROLD
I have an accountant

MATT GABE
Barry Sukenick doesnt work Ive had a chance to review
on this scale Dad some of the documents--
MATT

And as we move toward selling the
house I think it might be a good
time to get some affairs in order

HAROLD MATT
If we sell the house it Well Brian and James who
will be my decision you met--
HAROLD

They were a very charming
interracial homosexual couple

And smart about the work They
were familiar with Gilded Halfwing

offer

HAROLD

prominent place in the gallery

MATT
(politely)
Sounds good Congratulations

Gabe gets out some papers from his briefcase

GABE
You purchased the property in 1973
for 60 thousand dollars But
since youve borrowed against the
house a couple of times the net
proceeds have diminished--

HAROLD
Danny thinks after this show my
work could appreciate considerably
in value and that we should wait

MATT
(annoyed)
You just told me Danny doesnt
want to sell at all Dad
whatever happens at Bard you
cant afford the real estate taxes-—

GABE
Youre paying two grand a month in
utilities Even things you
wouldnt think the housekeeper

MATT HAROLD
Gabe-- (sternly to Gabe)
Mercedes has been with us
for years And although I
deplore her politics Im
not letting her go

GABE HAROLD
Im just giving examples-- (re Gabe)
Am I paying for him

MATT
No hes doing this as a favor to
me Gabes specialty is not my
specialty Im in personal

wealth
HAROLD MATT
Something I wouldnt know Gabe would only get paid
about when we sell

HAROLD
Im not giving Gabe anything
Absolutely not And I’m not
having this conversation with him
This is a private family matter

GABE
OK I understand

HAROLD
Normally a conspiracy is mounted
by people close to you I dont
even know this asshole

Harold stands up and walks toward the door
MATT

(to the waiter)
Well get a check

MATT
(sighs to Gabe)

poster

INT NEW FANCY RESTAURANT

the end of a crowded banquette

HAROLD

client thats why we could get a
table so last minute

Matt continues looking to impress his Dad even just a
little

MATT

My name is Sigourney I

said My name is Harold

MATT HAROLD
Uh huh LJ says hes going to try
to come to the show at Bard
MATT
(politely)

Thats great

HAROLD
Im sure LJ would like to see
you there

MATT
(vaguely)
If Im in town
HAROLD
I think Im going to show the
bronze sphere Its an early

piece I made when you used to sit
on the floor and watch me work
You remember that

MATT
Youve told me this before and I
dont remember it

HAROLD
You would hand me tools and make
suggestions as if you too were the

artist
MATT HAROLD
Well I wasnt It was originally untitled
but Im going to call it
Matthew

MATT
(changing the subject)
Id like to see Eliza too She
sent me her movie which I thought
was really good Did you like it

HAROLD
At that time I thought you might
be interested in sculpture Or
maybe an actor or a comic You
were a very talented mimic

MATT
I do the voices of a lot of my co-
workers which cracks people up at
the firm
(doing a voice)
Im going to run downstairs for

an esmoke You dont know Ezra
but thats a pretty good
imitation

HAROLD

You were also very musical like
Danny

MATT
But Danny could really play

HAROLD
He was chubby as a kid but
surprisingly dexterous No thats
true Danny was quite gifted I
dont know why he didnt pursue it
I know he raised a child but in
this day and age its possible to
do both

MATT
There are so many other things
that factor in dont you think

HAROLD
I suppose thats true he had a
difficult mother

MATT
And poor Jean I feel like she
just opted out oflife Has
Jean ever had a boyfriend

MATT HAROLD
Or girlfriend Apparently her office-movies
show real ability

HAROLD
I thought youd do something
artistic

MATT
I work with artists I understand

the temperament

HAROLD
Maybe Eliza will be my heir in that
department Although she seems
more commercially minded And
potentially a lesbian

MATT
Really I didnt get that
(clears his throat)
You know I think I mentioned to
you I left the company I was with
and me and a couple of other
people started our own firm
HAROLD
Maureen is talking to a
friend who works at the
Times about getting someone
to come up and review the
show In recent years Ive
been essentially ignored by
the Times and I think this
might put me back on the
map

MATT

MATT
It was scary and a big
change but things have
settled and were doing
really well A lot of our
old clients came with us
think were a great
alternative to some of the
bigger firms

(showing Harold an image

on his phone)
This is our logo

Harold unfolds his collapsible drugstore glasses and puts

them on

HAROLD

Fifty-five dollars for a steak

MATT

Theyre known for their meat here

HAROLD

(reading the menu)
And thirty-five dollars for a

salmon

Do you get the salmon to

blow you for that price
(Matt smiles politely)
Do you want to split a salmon

MATT

Im going to get my own steak I
didnt eat on the plane

HAROLD

A whole portion is going to be too

much food for me

MATT
Then eat what you can

MATT
(pause)
Im paying

The waiter comes

HAROLD
Im just going to have a
starter

I

WAITER

before Do you have any
questions

HAROLD
We have answers

Matt takes out the pill from his pocket He nibbles off a
corner and tucks the rest away

HAROLD
Im going to have the salad--

WAITER
The little gem OK

HAROLD WAITER
(hesitates ) The six ounce or the twelve
--to start and then the
steak
HAROLD

Twelve And

(turning to Matt)
Maybe a spinach for the table
The potatoes sound good

MATT
Sure

HAROLD
Shall we get a wine

MATT
Live it up

HAROLD
And maybe this Brunello

MATT
Ill have the steak And the
market salad And we dont have a
ton of time so if you can bring
everything at once

The waiter leaves

HAROLD
Hows my grandson who I never get
to see

MATT

Here

He shows a photo on his phone to Harold

HAROLD
Hes quite handsome His hair is
so blonde

MATT
No thats his friend Sebastian

HAROLD
Oh hes the one with his hand in
his trousers

MATT HAROLD
He was tucking in his shirt He looks like the child in
Kubricks The Shining

MATT
Thats the sweater I think

HAROLD
Handsome boy Has the Meyerowitz
eyes Does he like the Knicks I
suppose hell be a Laker fan since
youre essentially an Angeleno at

this point
MATT HAROLD
Yeah but New York isn’t Ive never forgiven Kobe for
what it was My artist what he did
clients are all moving out
west now
MATT

Its hard to have a relationship
AND a child

MATT
I imagine youve felt that too

HAROLD
No not really I didnt find
that difficult

MATT
Dad youve been married FOUR
times

HAROLD

Three The first was annulled

MATT
I married her because of Tony
but

(MORE )

MATT (CONTD)
I dont know I think about what
it would mean to leave buteven
contemplating it makes me feel
guilty

HAROLD
Guilt is not a useful emotion It
blocks feeling My advice is to
go to work Start a new project

MATT
I work every day Dad I go to an
office

HAROLD

Well I havent met his mother so I
cant advise you in that
department

MATT
You could have met her if youd
come to our wedding

HAROLD
You did it in LA
MATT HAROLD
There are planes I always felt you should

have invited your brother
and sister

MATT
Theyre half I dont talk to
them or know them really

HAROLD
You and your brother were quite
close as kids I remember you

dressing like him

MATT
He lived with us for one year
until you kicked him out

HAROLD
I didnt kick him out He needed
to go back with his mom and Jean
Your mom felt we didnt have
enough space

MATT
Well anyway I didnt invite a
lot of people but everyone I
invited including Mom came
except for you

HAROLD
Well if you break up what does it
matter anyway

A fashionable European man and woman are eating at a
smaller table next to Harold and Matt in the same
banquette The European man while in conversation puts
his glasses case on the Meyerowitz table

HAROLD
Its so brazen

MATT
What

HAROLD
This jerk placed his glasses on
our table

MATT
I dont think he realizes

HAROLD
No he knows exactly what hes
doing

MATT

Dad in terms of your estate I
dont want you to make mistakes
that can be avoided

HAROLD
Then they will be my mistakes

Theyre served their wine

HAROLD
Before she dried out Maureen
drank half my wine cellar so I
havent had any good wine ina
while But shes been sober now
for six weeks

MATT
Is she still going to AA

HAROLD
She’s doing it her own way
Maureen is made uncomfortable by AA
which I can understand Its quite
infantilizing giving away your
control like that

MATT
I think thats the idea

HAROLD
I tell Maureen I dont like you
when you drink You become a
different person I say
(exasperated)
Do we look like we need two
ketchups

MATT
What are you talking about

HAROLD
This son of a bitch just put his
ketchup on our table too

The ketchup bottle is now next to the glasses case at the
end of their table

HAROLD
Before you know it hell be
sitting in my lap

The man balls up his napkin and puts it next to the ketchup
and glasses case on their table

HAROLD
I want to punch this guy in the
nose

MATT

Its fine Dad we have the bigger
table Just let it go

The man now places his wine glass on their table Harold
reaches over and takes a sip from the glass and puts it
back Matt looks horrified

MATT
Dad what the fuck--

The Man doesnt notice however He and his date are
finishing up and preparing to leave

MATT
Please dont do that again

HAROLD
Its my protest

MATT
You better hope he doesnt have a
cold

The European man grabs his jacket from the shared banquette
bench as Harold and leaves with his date

MATT
Theyre gone Can you relax now
Id like to relax now

HAROLD MATT
So brazen (changing the subject)
I think the Knicks might be
interesting this year--

HAROLD
Wait a minute Wheres my jacket

MATT
Right next to you

HAROLD
This isnt my jacket
(he looks around)
That son of a bitch took my

jacket
MATT HAROLD
What do you mean He has my jacket Matthew

Outside the window the European man and his date are
talking Their steaks are brought to the table

MATT
Hes still outside-- I1l get it
back

HAROLD

Shit its three oclock I have
to put money in the meter

MATT
Forget it

HAROLD
(sternly)
Im not getting a ticket Matthew

MATT
Fuck it Im going to grab the
guy you get the check and settle
up

HAROLD
I thought you were paying I
wouldnt have ordered that wine
otherwise

MATT
Well what do you want me to do

HAROLD
Wheres our waiter
(loudly to the waiter)
Excuse me Excuse me

People look over at them

MATT HAROLD
Dad-- Can we get a bill

Matt is given the check and he instantly hands over his
credit card

HAROLD
(standing)
Youre not going to look at the
bill Make sure that it all adds

up

MATT
We dont have time Dad hes
getting away

HAROLD
We never got the spinach Or any
of the free stuff you suggested
they might give us--

EXT STREET NEAR FANCY RESTAURANT

Matthew is running after the couple who is about a half
block ahead Matt keeps stopping and waiting for his
father to partially catch up pointing in the direction
hes going and then running ahead again

MATT
Excuse me

EUROPEAN MAN
(immediately
confrontational)

MATT
Sorry There was a mix-up back
there You seem to have taken my
Dads jacket

EUROPEAN MAN

What

MATT
You have his jacket We have
yours

(looking over his
shoulder at Harold in
the distance)

Its on its way

CUT TO Harold is moving as quickly as possible He stops
to catch his breath He watches his son up ahead talking
heatedly with the European couple

He puts his hand into the jacket pocket and retrieves a
small piece of white paper He stares at it

CUT TO The European man removes his right glove with his
teeth and feels the material of his jacket with his bare
hand

EUROPEAN MAN
This is my jacket man

MATT
I think it isnt Just wait until
he gets here

EUROPEAN MAN
I know what jacket I took

He and the woman start to walk away
MATT
(forcefully)
I understand that but you took
the wrong one

EUROPEAN MAN
Youre crazy man

Matt is now furious

MATT
Listen just wait a second OK
Jesus what does it cost you
Where you got to be

EUROPEAN MAN
So crazy man

The couple walks briskly ahead Harold is approaching
Matt

HAROLD
Wheres he going

Matt turning it on now catches up to the man and touches
his shoulder

MATT
Hey Turn around

The European Man turns around violently his fist clenched

EUROPEAN MAN
You want to get hit man

MATT

problem

Matt looks back at his father who is staring at the small
piece of paper

MATT

called Fault In Our Stars

EUROPEAN MAN

MATT
Of course you do It has kids

MATT
(incredulous )

Stars

HAROLD
In the country at the Triplex It
was quite affecting actually
Those kids are tremendously
winning

Matt and the European man stare at Harold

HAROLD
Tell the man I want my jacket
back

MATT

(to the man)
Listen give my father his jacket
back and stop being such--

A look of realization passes across his face He stops and
turns around to his Dad

MATT
Dad how would this guy have your
ticket stub to Fault In Our Stars
in his jacket

HAROLD
I guess that wouldnt make sense
Maybe this is my jacket

EXT STREET NEAR FANCY RESTAURANT HAROLDS CAR
Harold approaches the car smiling

HAROLD
No ticket A stroke of luck

Matt trails behind exhausted and still worked up

MATT
That guy was a real asshole

HAROLD
He was And we never really had

MATT (CONTD)

Matt hesitates he doesnt want to have to say

MATT

INT MATTS MOMS APARTMENT

Were in the midst of a conversation between Julia (early
70s and Matts Mom) Harold and Matt The place is warmly
furnished with books on shelves old rugs photos of
family

JULIA HAROLD
--and that was the summer on We were staying at the Knapp
Marthas Vineyard with LJ house the one with that
and Maya and Paul and Lori peculiar blind dog
JULIA

And Matthew you were making up
all of those card games do you
remember And there was one in
particular where I asked if it was
based on luck and you said it was
based on “hope”

Harold gives Matthew a warm squeeze on the neck Matthew
smiles too

JULIA
You “hope” you get a good card
And that’s what we would say all
summer “It’s based on hope”

HAROLD
I was commissioned to make Gilded
Halfwing that summer LJ was
very jealous I had already sold a
piece to the Whitney

MATT
Where do they keep that piece

HAROLD
(defensive)
Its not lost They catalog these
things

MATT JULIA
I didnt say it was Harold did you see

She points to a framed sketch on the wall Harold goes
over to it

HAROLD
You still have one of the sketches-

JULIA HAROLD
Yes --of Gilded Halfwing It
looks good here

JULIA
Yeah Cody really admires it He
says it gives him ideas

HAROLD
I thought Cody was a gym teacher

JULIA
He taught Spanish at PS 182 and
coached the soccer team Matthew
Codys sons are coming for dinner
Im making a meatloaf

MATT HAROLD
OK good Im starving I told Matthew this seems
like an elaborate ruse just
to get his parents back
together

Julia laughs

MATT
You didnt tell me that

Matts phone is ringing He checks it

MATT
This is Tony on Face Time do you
mind if I--

JULIA
Harold do you want a coffee or
tea or anything

MATT HAROLD
He has to go-- Tea would be nice I cant
have coffee after four And
if you have a Triscuit or
something Im also
starving

Matt steps away somewhat hesitantly as he doesnt like
the idea of leaving his Dad alone with his Mom He answers
the phone holding it out to see his son on the other end

MATT
Hi sweetheart

TONY
Im playing a game for a minute
its called All The Animals Are

Dead
MATT
Can you move the phone up so I can
see-- The other way
TONY MATT
Thats down Down then honey

Matt watches his father and mother talking Julia serves
Harold tea

JULIA
Sorry Im in the middle of
cooking for a big clan tonight

HAROLD
Is this my Buddenbrooks

JULIA
What

Harold removes a book from the shelf
HAROLD

I think this is my copy of
Buddenbrooks

Harold looks back at the shelf for other books that may
have been his Matt distracted by his parents frowns

TONY
Would you rather a beard made from
paper or a beard made from a tree

MATT
Whats a beard from a tree

TONY
A beard made from a tree is like
beard that is like a tree

MATT TONY
(to Tony) Yeah But like a beard
Like the leaves on a tree

MATT

I guess a beard made from a tree
TONY

Me too

(new one)

Would you rather die from old age
or kill yourself

Matt watches his Dad sloppily blow his nose into a
handkerchief

MATT
(almost to himself)
Old age I guess

TONY
Me too

VICTORIA
Did you give him regular milk

MATT
(startles)
Victoria I didnt know you were
there
VICTORIA

Of course Im here he doesnt
know how to use the phone himself

TONY VICTORIA
Yes I do He has red all over his
cheeks and chin he said
Daddy gave me regular milk

MATT VICTORIA
He likes it better-- He cant have dairy
MATT
We dont know that for a fact--
TONY
Im going to press the button now
MATT VICTORIA
OK I love you baby Yes we do know that--
TONY

Im pressing the--
And theyve hung up

Harold pages through the edition of Buddenbrooks Julia is
cooking at the stove in the background

JULIA (0S)
We were very thorough when we
divided the books That I
remember

MATT
(approaching his father)
Me too Put it back Dad

He kind of half places it back

HAROLD
Ive been looking for this
edition

MATT

Youve lived without it now for
thirty years I think youll
manage

JULIA
(walking back into the
living room)
You can take it Harold if you
want Ive mostly stopped reading
fiction

MATT
Dad Ill walk you to your car

HAROLD
I can stay a bit longer

Julia embraces Harold

JULIA
It was so nice to see you again I
think the last time was Matt’s
graduation You know Ive always
wanted to say and Ive thought
about writing or calling but I
just never did it I have huge
regrets about how I was with Danny
and Jean I was a kid too in many
ways and they were so angry at me
I took your lead frankly and we
were starting over -- we had
Matthew -- and we didnt want to
look back which was
understandable butI wish Id
been more nurturing of them more
generous more mothering really
I think theyve suffered in part
because of that and I feel
terrible Anyway I just wanted to
say that

EXT MATT’S MOM’S APARTMENT COBBLE HILL NIGHT
Matt walks briskly a step or two ahead of his father
HAROLD
Its called flirting when youre

young Im not sure what its
called when youre over seventy

MATT HAROLD
(pointing up ahead) She still has my drawing on
Youre just up here-- her wall next to the gym

teachers doodle

MATT
Codys a good guy

HAROLD

Your mothers more comfortable
ultimately being with men who are
half-smart men she can dominate
I was much too formidable After
our separation and before Cody
she was with a homosexual and
before that a man who had no foot

They stop at the car

HAROLD
Her fraudulent claims about not
reading fiction I find offensive
(MORE )
Matt sees
frowns

You taking the bridge or the

tunnel

HAROLD (CONTD)
Shes masquerading as a populist so
as not to threaten Cody but its a
clever yet bogus subterfuge Its
a shame your mother who knows
better has succumbed to this
fashionable anti-art movement
This is why we have a Republican
congress

that Harold carries the copy of Buddenbrooks

HAROLD
She said I could have it It was
mine originally

MATT
(annoyed)
You have your keys

HAROLD

She was clearly very happy to see
me When it ended we werent on
speaking terms but now you see
that big hug she insisted on
giving me

(pause)
You know Maureen always says your
mother was the love of my life

MATT HAROLD

tomorrow Thats why I
drove all the way into

Brooklyn
MATT
Im staying a few days
(coughs )

I was around all this plaster dust
earlier

HAROLD
We have lots of room Maureen is
keen on seeing you as well You
know shes your step-mother as
much as Cody is your step-father

MATT
I told Mom Id stay here

HAROLD
Maybe you split half the time
there and half with us

I thought you were leaving
(with growing anger)

MATT
(snapping)

Im not splitting the time like I
did at fifteen

HAROLD
It was very important to me after
our separation that I see you
half the time I wanted to make
it up after Danny and Jean

MATT HAROLD

Then make it up to them you Danny and Jean

Really

could have done better

I dont see anything

significant I could have

done better with you

MATT HAROLD
Nothing You feel Come on Matthew

like that all was great

MATT
Danny definitely got shit and
Jean didn’t EVEN get shit But I
got your focus and that fucked me
up in a whole other way

HAROLD
Matthew we never see each other
lets not fight

MATT

(furiously)
I keep thinking I know how to
handle you now but then I see you
and I get suckered into your shit
all over again Your career your
jacket And when I try to actually
help you like today you WONT
LISTEN

Harold opens the car door and hesitates

Right--

HAROLD
I dont know how I could be such a
bad father look how successful
you are

MATT HAROLD
I could never be the
businessman you are

I made a real effort with

MATT HAROLD
OK-- Ive said to Maureen I
dont know who Matthew takes
after I certainly didnt
know how to make money

Matt shouts across the vehicle

MATT
That’s right I don’t take after
you None of us do You had to
be the only artist in the family
And it doesn’t matter that I make
money because you dont respect
what I do

Harold climbs in the car

HAROLD
What do you need my respect for
the world respects you because you
make money

MATT
(throws up his hands)
Ugh I want to punch YOU in the
nose

Matt runs around to the drivers side

HAROLD
I know you think you can treat me
this way because of your money

MATT
It doesnt matter how much money I
make you make me feel like a big
piece of shit because YOU DONT
CARE ABOUT IT

Harold starts the car

MATT
But you also actually DO Youre
privately obsessed with it You
know that I BEAT you I BEAT YOU

The car pulls away

MATT
What the fuck am I talking about
Im so angry at myself for getting
sucked into THIS

TITLE
The Opening
TEXT

In her twelve years as a neurosurgeon Dr Malini Soni had never
seen such a dramatic shove

INT NURSES STATION PITTSFIELD HOSPITAL DAY
The sucking and periodic beeping sounds of a hospital

DR SONI (VO)
Its quite startling

CUT TO CLOSE on a CAT SCAN

DR SONI (0S)
A collection of fluids on the left
side of the head was shoving the
brain clear to the right

A finger enters the frame pointing

DR SONI (0S)
His brain experienced so much
pressure and irritation that he
was in an almost comatose state
before we operated

Dr Soni an Indian woman in her 40s and Pam 30s a
nurse hover above a computer screen at a terminal

DR SONI
There was still some bleeding in
the left frontal lobe but no
tissue was lost The head trauma
clogged up the spinal fluid
absorption pathways which slows
speech causes lethargy
headaches

Dr Soni straightens up and heads for the door Pam
follows her into the --

DR SONI
(shakes her head)
Honestly this should have been
taken care of immediately after
the trauma

PAM
Did you notice his wife was
heavily perfumed but I think I
smelled alcohol on her breath

DR SONI
Yes Im worried about her as
well

They both stop at a hospital room doorway

INT HOSPITAL ROOM

Danny and Jean sit in adjacent chairs Danny slumped in
his soft leather jacket and shorts stares into space He

has a brown grocery bag of clothes in his lap Jean reads

a book They both look exhausted

Harold lies unconscious in bed an oxygen mask on his face
and a drain protruding from a shaved portion of his head

PAM
Oh I didn’t realize anyone was
here
The siblings startle and both stand immediately Dannys
bag slipping from his lap and hitting the floor the
clothes spilling out

DANNY
Shit Sorry

He starts collecting his underwear and socks

JEAN DANNY
Sleeping Not doing muchsleeping

Pam checks his blood pressure and oxygen readings

PAM
Good Youre family

DANNY JEAN

JEAN

me not to talk to anyone else

DANNY
Well thats not right obviously
Were his kids

JEAN
You can talk to us

DR SONI
No thats what Im saying since

sorry

They both stare back at her desperate

DANNY
He has an opening on Monday

JEAN
(oddly )
This is our first real hospital

DR SONI
Talk to your step-mother

EXT PITTSFIELD BAR DAY

Maureen furtively exits the local bar wearing her rose
tinted glasses and heads briskly down the main street

DANNY (0S)
Why did you tell the doctor not to
talk to us

She spots Danny and Jean out of the corner of her eye and
picks up the pace

JEAN
Maureen

Danny and Jean run to catch up Danny limping worse than
before

MAUREEN
(re his limp)
Are you moving that way on
purpose

DANNY
What No Its always worse
after Ive been sitting

MAUREEN
I thought you were mocking me
DANNY
You dont walk that way

him

MAUREEN
I thought it was a bad imitation
DANNY JEAN
Maureen We need to be able to talk
to Doctor Soni
MAUREEN
Doctor Soni looks very much like a
chum of mine from university who
became an art looter but thats
of no use to you
DANNY JEAN
No Absolutely none
MAUREEN
Ill get the information and you
can ask me E-mail might be best
if youre going to be in
Rochester
JEAN
Im here Dannys here
DANNY
Im here
JEAN
You have to tell her its OK to
speak to me or Danny or Matt
who’s on his way
DANNY JEAN

DANNY

He texted you You texted him

They reach Maureens car

MAUREEN
Do you think Im not going to tell
you the truth

She opens the drivers seat door

JEAN
I can drive Maureen

MAUREEN
(getting into the car)
Jean you were wearing that same
sweater that last time I saw you

JEAN
(baffled)
Was I

Maureen starts the car the siblings stand outside

DANNY

(emotional)
Maureen weve been sitting in
that room with him and hes
attached to those machines and
theres a drain in his head and
hes unconscious and we dont know
where you are or whats going on

(snapping)
TALK TO THE DOC--

EXT PITTSFIELD HOSPITAL PARKING LOT SUNRISE

In the dawn light a rental car pulls up Matt climbs out
of the back holding a leather overnight bag He wears his
suit rumpled from the flight with a T-shirt

INT HOSPITAL ROOM

Matt sits across from his father who sleeps Pam comes in

PAM
Oh hi
Matt smiles tiredly
MATT PAM
Hey Hes still sleeping Im
Pam the nurse
MATT

Im Matt the son

PAM
Oh I met your brother and sister

MATT
Half brother and sister yeah Is
he OK
PAM
Dr Soni spoke with your step-
mother and then with your siblings
-- half-siblings -- and its all
been cleared up and she can talk
to you freely now

MATT
OhOK Hows he doing

PAM
Your father was brought to us the
night before last but because he
was taking baby aspirin which
thins the blood Dr Soni had to
wait until the morning to operate

MATT
What happened

PAM
He had a chronic subdural
hematoma which in his case meant
there had been steady bleeding in
his head for some time

MATT
How did he get this

PAM
Something like this generally
comes from a fall or if he hit his
head--

MATT
He fell about four months ago
Bruno pulled him onto a path

PAM
Honestly Im surprised he had
such a delayed response He must
have a real tolerance for
discomfort

MATT
Will he be OK

PAM
Well because he waited so long
there was quite a bit of
irritation in the frontal lobes
and now that the pressure is off
the brain it causes severe
agitation

(MORE )

PAM (CONTD)
The frontal lobes are language
(pause)
But it’s potentially a hundred
percent recoverable

Harold opens his eyes and looks up at Matt

PAM
(backing out the door)
Ill leave you guys

MATT
Thanks Pam

Harold smiles brightly almost innocently
back awkwardly

MATT
(to his Dad)
Do you know my name

HAROLD
Of course its Matthew

Matt encouraged holds up his phone

MATT
What is this

HAROLD
Blackberry

MATT

(smiles)

Yes

HAROLD

MATT

MATT

HAROLD

Matt hesitates

Matt smiles
MATT

quiet the brain

Were putting him in a barbiturate
coma with a combination of Propofol
and Pentobarbital or Phenobarbital
Probably Pento I want to be
aggressive

computer and then restarting Or
if youre a luddite like me like
a grain of sand becoming a pearl

strangely

another family and then he finds
me when he’s twenty-one Let him
come to me

Danny gets up to grab napkins from another table
DANNY
He’s not a girl you’re trying to

EXT MAUREENS DRIVEWAY LATE DAY

Maureen pulls into the gravel nodding hello to Matt who
stretches before a run

MATT
Hi Maureen

She drives past Matt Matt continues to loosen up as we
watch her car slowly veer onto the grass and roll down into
a tree Matt turns when he hears the soft impact

INT MAUREEN’S HOUSE KITCHEN

Its filled with dusty appliances yogurt containers full of
tacks and coins faded photos and outdated menus crookedly
affixed with random refrigerator magnets Matt finds a musty
water pitcher with an old filter and fills it
MAUREEN
Its a shame the Dad is going to

miss the opening tomorrow He was

really looking forward to it

MATT
Dad asked me to say something I

was going to ask Danny and Jean

too

He removes some mismatched bowls from a cabinet looking
for glasses A Popov vodka bottle is stashed in the back
He turns around Maureen quickly averts her eyes Matt
hesitates and takes the bottle

MAUREEN
He never would have expected you
to have shown up We were trying
to figure it out have you ever
even been to this house before

MATT
No

He pours her and him a glass of vodka She hesitates but

takes it
her face

She holds a frozen pack of peas to the bruise on

MAUREEN
The Dad always hoped for a visit
but I guess you always had a lot to
do in the City when you came to
town And us not being A-list
parents and all Danny and Jean
of course are here all the time
but that’s less exciting for the
Dad

Matt drinks his vodka

MATT
I reached out to some of his old
friends who are going to come
visit

MAUREEN
(rising)
I hope they understand theyll be
looking at a sleeping man Hello
Andy Warhol

MATT
I explained that In so many
words
MAUREEN

I spoke to the neurologist Dr
Diebert who seems very
knowledgeable but has no upper lip
to speak of and if Harold survives
the infection they have no idea
what person will be there when he
wakes up Maybe hell be Brad
Pitt Or Neruda Or Joe the
Plumber

(with real feeling but

dramatically)
I just want him to be Harold

MATT
(changing the subject)
Have you looked over the documents
I sent you

Maureen rises and retrieves an envelope from

She hands

MAUREEN
Yes and given where we are with
the Dadand the Manhattan house
is more than we need right now
I’ve taken your counsel and I
think selling the house and art to
James and Brian is the right thing
to do I signed the places you
marked for me

the manila envelope to Matthew

MATT
Then it’s done

MAUREEN
Some of those pieces are quite
large how will they be displayed

MATT
(abashed)
Well you know Jamess family
owns a series of retirement
communities around the country and
theyre going to donate the art to
these facilities as a write-off

MAUREEN
(hesitates)
OhOK I can’t believe Danny is
happy about that and Jeanwell
who knows what Jean feels about
anything

a drawer
MATT
(trying to rationalize)
Well with Dad’s illnessI
thought I’d wait until after the
show to tell them anythingI
don’t know there’s been so much
going on

MAUREEN
Really they have no power anyway
I don’t know what happened to them
as children -- Harold says he
tried his best -- but they’re
really such disappointments

MATT
(sadly)
Nobody took care of them

Maureen nods

MAUREEN

I say that as a disappointment
myself I was neglected too
during my childhood It’s funny
I was never interested in having
kids Maybe once No not even
once

(drinks)
You’re very good at getting the
most for your clients

MATT
It’s what I do

realized someone was watching me

almost politely and then he lowered
his tight bathing suit took out
his penis and started stroking it

MATT DANNY

Paul did

JEAN
I watched him until he finished
Then he walked away

DANNY
Did you tell anyone

JEAN
I told Dad that night and he asked
if Paul had touched me and I said
No He thought we should probably
just leave it then they were going
back to the City soon anyway But
that if Paul did it again hed
punch him in the nose The next
day when I was leaving I looked
around for Dad to say goodbye but
he was playing tennis I thought
about telling your Mom Matthew
but I was afraid shed get angry at
me I remember crying on my way to
the ferry

Matt and Danny look stunned

MATT
Jean can I ask you a question
Why do you always show up for Dad
Why are you always HERE

JEAN
(shrugs and says matter-
of-factly)

I could smash every car in this
parking lot and burn the hospital
down and it wouldn’t un-fuck me
up

(silence)
You guys will never understand
what it’s like to be me in this
family

(opening her door)
Lets go to Bard

INT BARD GALLERY DAY
A mix of faculty students artists and out-of-towners
mingle amongst the work Eliza gathers with her friends

and Jean

And older woman Hilma Federman says to another teacher
HILMA
He voted against my chairmanship
but I always liked him

From across the room an attractive woman 30s talking
with a group smiles at Matt

Matt in his suit with a tie smiles back He stands in
front of Harolds bronze sculpture which is prominently
displayed

DANNY (0S)
This toast is really stressing me
out

Danny appears and hands Matt a champagne Danny wears his
leather jacket over a shirt and tie and khakis with a
hummus stain on the fly Jean passes by on her way to the
bar

DANNY
Jean you sure you dont want to
say anything

JEAN
Fuck no

Matt fishes into his pocket and produces the two pills

MATT
Ive had these for a while but I
think they’re still good Want
one

DANNY
What will it do to me

MATT
It will either bring you up or
down Hopefully down I guess

DANNY
(inspecting it)
Someone took a bite already

MATT
That was me I had a crumb when I
last saw Dad

DANNY
Oh OK
(pause)
What did it do to you then
MATT
Made me annoyed at Dad I dont
know

Matt and Danny each take a pill and down it with champagne
A blonde kid drapes his arm around Elizas neck Danny
frowns

DANNY
What about Marcus

MATT
They broke up
DANNY MATT
How do you know that-- This woman keeps smiling at
me

The attractive woman is smiling at Matt

MATT
Im getting a real energy from
her

Suddenly she excuses herself from her conversation and
walks toward them

DANNY
Shes walking over here

Matt runs his hand through his hair

MATT
I look OK

DANNY
Yeah you look handsome

Matt places his drink on Harold’s sculpture Danny quickly
removes it She approaches Matt her face blushing

WOMAN

MATT
Yes
(pause)
This is Danny also Harold
Meyerowitzs son

WOMAN

MATT
(not what he expected)
Oh
WOMAN MATT

EXT BARD GALLERY DAY

Matt pursues Danny outside

MATT
Dont beat yourself up
DANNY
I should never have left that
opening at MOMA It was
justDad I felt obligated

MATT
You thought you were doing the
right thing

DANNY
You wouldve stayed

MATT
I probably wouldve yeah But I
would have felt bad about it But
its a good lesson Dad can take
care of himself You have to take
care of yourself

DANNY
No he cant Matt Thats why
hes where he is now
(beating himself up)
I shouldve been able to tell
something was wrong I just
thought he was getting old

MATT
Shit I yelled at him The guy
was suffering and I screamed at
him on the street Theres no
catharsis in shouting at an old
person whos dying

DANNY
Do you think hes going to die

ELIZA (0S)
Dad I want you to meet someone
this is Robin

Eliza and Robin the blonde boy stand by the door with

drinks

Robin smokes Danny approaches Matt behind him

DANNY
(shaking hands)
Nice to meet you

ROBIN
(trying to sound adult)
You too Eliza speaks very highly
of you
DANNY
OhOK
(to Eliza)
You speak highly of me

ELIZA
You know what he means

Eliza cracks open a beer

DANNY
Eliza youve had two wines
already dont have a beer too

ELIZA
I can handle it

DANNY
Eliza its not good to mix wine
and beer Youll feel cruddy
tomorrow Im telling you

ELIZA
Ive done it before Dad

MATT
Maybe shes right maybe she has a
constitution that can handle the
grape and the grain

DANNY
Please juststay out of this

ELIZA
Matts right I have the fortitude
for it

DANNY

Im telling you youre going to
feel like crap

Eliza takes a swallow Danny grabs the beer from her and
chucks it Robin looks scared

ELIZA
What the fuck man

She storms back inside the gallery Robin trailing behind
MATT

What does it matter if she drinks
wine and beer

DANNY
Stop interfering with my
parenting Matt

MATT
Shes eighteen What parenting
do you need to do here Shes
just a person now

DANNY
This is something I do and Im
quite good at it OK She and I
have a very good relationship when
youre not around So stop
ganging up on me

Matt reaches out and takes Dannys shoulder

MATT
(trying to diffuse)
Im sorry You know Ive enjoyed
hanging out recently

DANNY
Yeah Me too You know Ive
wanted to apologize for a long
time

MATT
For what

DANNY
Im pissed at myself because when
Dad kicked me out of the house and
I moved back with my mom you
really made an effort to hang out
and I kind of blew you off And I
feel like I fucked that up I
think its really my fault that
were not close

Danny hugs Matt strangely

DANNY
It was hard for me to be around
Dad and your mom at that time too
They were so critical of me and I
was just FAILING

MATT
(trying to end it)
We should go back in give our
toasts

DANNY
(oddly )
Are you disappointed in me

MATT
What No no

They both wander moving circling -- theres restless pent
up energy thats slowly being released by both of them

DANNY
I know Dad is But I felt like
you maybe also were critical of me
for quitting piano and--

MATT
No no no You were my big
brother I looked up to you

DANNY
I quit because it was my protest
OK

MATT

OK Like McEnroe

DANNY
And alsobecause it was
likeit was like walking
barefoot through broken glass to
get to a milkshake I loved the
milkshake but you know my feet
werebleeding

MATT
I can understand that

DANNY
Can you Cause my feeling about
you is you cant Its not your

fault but like Dad you make me
feel really bad about myself

MATT
Im sorry

DANNY
I said its not your fault

MATT
(leaning back toward the
gallery building)
Lets go in
DANNY
Can I ask you something

MATT
(uh-oh )
What

DANNY
A few years ago when Karen and I
had you over to our house when you
were in town and I never heard
from you afterwards Maybe you
didnt like the food or Karen or I
insulted you in some way Karen
maybe had too much grappa--

MATT
No That was nice I went back
to LA I dont know

DANNY
Were you bored Most people seem
to find us interesting enough
weve had no complaints

MATT
Its nothing like that Its
justlifeits not more than
that

DANNY

Well even in life you can make an
effort Write an e-mail from one
of your phones But I guess
youre fine making no effort with
family You say you have guilt
but

MATT
(angry)
Im here now Im in fucking
Rhinebeck I was just in
Pittsfield Ive been HERE

DANNY
(emotional)
It shouldnt come to that And if
Dad survives youll go back to LA
and Im going to be taking care of
him for a very long time

MATT
Well all help out
DANNY
Nowe wont ALL Itll be me
And Jean And mainly me

MATT
Ill come more often

DANNY
Thats what you said when you ate
dinner with Karen and me
(walking away)
Youve made your priorities clear

MATT
You know what Im tired of
apologizing for doing well

DANNY
Ptolemy asked me why you never
talk Dads work up to your wealthy
clients He says you could be
really helpful that its all
perception You know hes a good
artist and theres no reason he
isnt as well known as LJ

MATT
Maybe its not my responsibility
to help Dad Maybe THAT

DANNY
No its what you DO

MATT
And ALSO maybe hes not so great
Maybe hes undiscovered for a
reason Maybe THAT The truth is
we DONT KNOW Danny We were
brainwashed

DANNY
Why are you so angry at him
anyway He loves everything you
do

MATT
Does he He doesnt tell me that

DANNY
He tells ME I should be angry at
him I should hate him for
treating me and Jean like second
class citizens
MATT
Then why dont you You SHOULD

He holds Dannys shoulder again and says more tenderly

MATT
Listen you and Jean are going to
get some money We got a great
deal on the house and all of the
art and I’m giving my share to both
of you It doesn’t make up for
everything but you guys really
deserve this

Danny slips from Matts grasp angry

DANNY
Dad said this was a family
discussion Waitdid thisdid
this happen already

MATT DANNY
Yes It’s done He told me we’d decide
together And you do this
when he can’t say
anything He told me
Matt You weren’t there

MATT
If we didn’t do something wed be
spending the next few years
throwing his work in dumpsters
This way we get something for it

DANNY
I don’t care about money That
house that work MEANS something

to me

MATT
You should embrace this I should
be the one who cares I grew up
there That’s MY house I SHOULD
care

DANNY

Then why don’t you

MATT
BecauseI don’t know You’re
probably right I should care
Maybe I do Maybe I do
(hesitates)

(MORE)
MATT (CONTD)
But this makes sense theyre going
to donate the art as a tax write-
off Jamess family owns a series
of retirement communities around
the country--

DANNY
How could you do this to him Who
could even dream up such a plan

MATT
Me Its what I do for a living

Danny shoves Matt Matt shoves him back

DANNY
Ptolemy said you guys make
yourselves indispensable to
vulnerable rich people

MATT
Why dont you tell me more about my
business Danny I really want YOU
or DAD or FUCKING Ptolemy to tell
ME about what I do every day for a
living

Matt pushes Danny Danny kicks him in the leg

MATT
Oww You kicked me in the shin

And now theyre scuffling awkwardly

MATT
(blurting out)
I WAS disappointed in you for
quitting piano

Danny swings wildly at him

MATT
What the fuck is wrong with you
I know its hard its hard for
all of us GET IT TOGETHER

DANNY
(now just shouting
insults)
And youre doing with Tony just
what Dad did with me and Jean

Matt slaps Danny hard across the face then slips on the
grass and lands on his ass Danny tackles him and they
topple onto the lawn hitting each other awkwardly

People emerge from the gallery College kids surround
them

COLLEGE KID 1
Hey hes beating up an old guy

COLLEGE KID 2
No theyre both old

COLLEGE KID 1
(shouting at the
brothers)
Whats wrong with you two

Theyre rolling on the grass Eliza and Jean try to stop
them but cant get close with the flailing arms and legs

LJ comes running out and lifts them both up and holds
them apart in headlocks

LJ
Goddamn it Meyerowitzes

Both are covered in dirt and grass and blood Danny
clutches the side of his leg

DANNY
My hip

He collapses on the ground

MATT (VO)
We want to thank Bard for making
this show happen

INT BARD GALLERY

Matt bloody his suit torn and still picking grass out of
his hair addresses the crowd He consults note cards and
talks smoothly and professionally despite his appearance

MATT
And thank many of you for making
the trip My Dad and Im sure
every artist involved in this
show would be really pleased

Jean indicates for him to address the bleeding coming from
his nose Matt wipes it on his arm

MATT
My father was a teacher here for
thirty-three years so this is
particularly special for him And
this piece is special for me as
its called Matthew My father
tells a story of how this piece
came to be How I would sit on
the hardwood floor of his studio
getting nails in my ass and hand
him tools and make suggestions and
he would let me help or let me
THINK I was helping and when it
was done he said we had made it
together Even though I don’t
remember this time he does But
I remember that feeling Of being
very proud Of wanting to be an
artist like my dad Of being

included -- he was interested in
me heloved me
(he wipes tears from his
face)

Im sorry I dont know why Im
Ive been angry at him for so much
of my adult life I guess I was
trying to outrun him But I didn’t
-- I’m still that boy helping my
Dad And he loved me Even if it
wasn’t how I wanted him to love me
he loved me And I’ve given away
his life’s work--it’s gone

(to Danny and Jean)
I’m sorry And if Dad doesn’t
make it he and I aren’t OK We
never got to be OK

Danny is there beside him now holding Matt in his arms
Matt continues to cry like a baby

MATT
(to the audience trying
to sound intelligible
but just crying)
Danny do you want to say a few
words

DANNY
Yes thank you Matthew

He holds out the mike for Danny to take Danny flinches
anticipating a punch

MATT
No Im giving this to you

DANNY
Oh I see OK

Danny takes the mike Eliza and Jean help Matt to a bench

Now Danny also bloody clothes torn looks petrified
hums an indecipherable tune He leans on the back of a
chair for support

DANNY
Youll have to bear with me as Im
not a good public speaker and also
Ive never done it Its something
Ive gone to great pains to avoid
When I used to perform music in
front of an audience it was just
too excruciating The reward was
just not worth the self-hatred
Not to mention unlike my brother
Matthew I find this particular
piece painful because it was during
a time I wasnt really speaking to
my Dad He had left my mother and
Jean and me gotten remarried to
Matts mom whom we did not like
Again unlike Matt I was NOT
included in the art-making process
it wasnt MINE too This piece
is NOT called Danny In fact
there are NO Dannys

JEAN (0S)
Or Jeans

DANNY
(nods )

For me its a symbol of what I
will NEVER be able to do A club I
will NEVER be admitted to But Dad
and I have gotten to spend more
time together as adults and thats
been good I think we have gotten
closer Weve certainly watched a
lot of Mets games Some of you
know my Dad is in a hospital in
Pittsfield and we dont know how
its all going to go Our doctors
in China and the only really good
nurse got reassigned to a different
floor Maybe I need to believe my
Dad was a genius because I dont
want his life to be worthless

(MORE )

He
DANNY (CONTD)
If hes not a great artist that
means he was just a prick I think
hes good though I think he
deserved more attention than he
got I think thats true Matt

Matt eyes bloodshot face splotchy shrugs

DANNY
I wish hed had more success
because it would have made his
life easier Even if that kind of
thing doesnt ultimately mean
much I dont know LJ

LJ
(shrugs)
I dont know either If I did
Id tell you
DANNY
Also Im really proud of my
daughter Eliza who is a freshman
here and a really talented
filmmaker
Elizas friends WHOOP Eliza smiles embarrassed
DANNY
Thank you
(awkwardly)
Peace

food Bruno barks Maureen greets him She wears round
clear glasses

MAUREEN
(to the dog)
Bruno--
(to Matt)
Did you change your scent
MATT MAUREEN
I dont have a scent-- Maybe a new shampoo

MATT
(mussing his hair)
I dont think--

MAUREEN
The Dad is being very stubborn I
cant get him to do any of his
exercises Bruno

MATT
Hows he doing

MAUREEN
The earliest appointment we can
get with the neurologist is next
month Its a lot for me to do
by myself here

She enters the house through the kitchen Matt follows

MAUREEN

Fortunately we have a little more
money from the sale James sent
photos of the sculptures at one of
the retirement homes in Arizona
They look quite stunning

(pause)
I have to say I was very surprised
that you tried to stop the deal
after you went through all that
trouble setting it up

MATT
I just thoughtI changed my
mind

MAUREEN

Well it was my decision as I’m
the next of kin It’s too late
now

She retrieves the black Vuarnet sunglasses from a pile of
odds and ends and hands them to Matt

MAUREEN
I found these in the Dads things
I think theyre yours

MATT
Theyre Dannys

He puts them in his jacket pocket Maureen enters the
dining room There are papers strewn across the table

MAUREEN
I just have to finish these
insurance forms which seem to be
written in a foreign language--

MATT
Maureen why didnt you ask me
someone at my company will do
that

She looks up tears falling from her eyes

MAUREEN
(emotionally)
I dont like to ask for help

MATT
(softly)
Let me do it OK

He steps forward about to place his hand on her shoulder
but she quickly recovers and heads for the door

MAUREEN
But its a big day its the Dads
first meal off of the feeding
tube
INT MAUREEN’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM
Matt follows into the living room Harold is watching TV

MAUREEN
Hes watching TCM

Matt hesitates His Dad looks older and wears a knit cap
Theres a weariness and frailty he carries now

MATT
Hey Dad

HAROLD
Hi

MATT

What are you watching

HAROLD
I dont know

Matt sits down next to him and they watch
HAROLD
In these 30s movies the men wore
tuxedos all the time Things have
gotten much more casual

MATT
Maybe they dressed up because they
lived shorter lives back then
They wanted to celebrate life

LATER
INT MAUREEN’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM

Matt and Maureen sit beside Harold who lies in a bed made

from the pull-out couch Bruno sleeps on the floor They
eat take-out Chinese food Harold eats quickly his bites
large

MAUREEN
We spent three hours today at
Goodwill The Dad had a funny
joke

HAROLD
What was that Oh

MAUREEN
Ill set you up again We spent
three hours today at Goodwill

HAROLD
Which pretty much destroyed mine

MATT
Ha Thats good Dad
HAROLD
Thank you
MATT

You should see the other dog
Harold has no reaction

MAUREEN
Thats true the Dad got very
impatient And as we were handing
over the boxes I saw that I had
accidentally included my good wok
And I hesitated But I thought I
havent made Chinese food in ten
years

(MORE )

MAUREEN (CONTD)
I wont make Chinese food
againbut you have your idea of
yourself and you want to hold onto
that

Harold erupts with a guttural cough

MATT
Dad are you OK

HAROLD
(spitting food back on
his plate)
Yes

MATT
Take it easy

MAUREEN
We just got you out of the
hospital we dont want you to go

back
HAROLD
It was very unpleasant in the
hospital
MATT
Uh huh
HAROLD

You know I was there for a couple
of months

MATT
I know

HAROLD
Maureen has been my savior

MAUREEN
Harold youre getting brown sauce
all over the sheets

Harold wipes at the sheet

MAUREEN
Youre just rubbing it in

Maureen sighs and gathers the plates
MAUREEN

Matt can you help the Dad get
ready for his nap

MATT
Sure I’m going to try to come
visit more It’s hard because

Tony starts kindergarten this
year and I want to be around for
that but I’11 try to be here
more

HAROLD
LJ is coming for lunch ina
couple of weeks you should come
for that

Maureen heads into the other room

HAROLD
He left me a very effusive message
about my show And someone wrote
a rave on my Google It was quite
inspired of you to set that up

MATT
Jean and Danny organized it Dad
HAROLD
Is that right But you made the
sale
MATT

Yeah that was me But I bought
a piece back from Brian and James
at a significant mark up I might
add It’s the piece from the
show “Matthew” because
Matthew” and we did it together
(formal but from the
heart)
Thank you for letting me be part
of your process It had a big
effect on me Dad Your

confidence was contagious I
think it’s why I’m able to do what
I do now

HAROLD

I remember I made “Matthew” in
1966 the year the Whitney bought
my piece

CLOSE on Matthew

MATT
It couldnt have been 1966

HAROLD
It was I didnt work in bronze
after that
MATT
I wasnt born yet
HAROLD
(the impact of this lost
on him)

Ohthats right isnt it then
it couldnt have been you watching
me could it Maybe it was your
brother

Matthew hesitates

HAROLD
I guess I wanted it to be you

MATT
You should have called it “Danny”

HAROLD
You’re right I should have Im
going to sleep now Can you close
that shade

MATT
OK

Matt rises and pulls the shade

HAROLD (0S)
It’s OK if you want to sit here
longer while I fall asleep

MATT
Sure

Matt comes around to his fathers bedside His dad removes
his hat and balls himself up in his sleeping position like
an infant

MATT
I love you Dad

HAROLD
Love you

Matt tucks the covers up to his neck leans down and kisses
his Dad on the forehead He sees hidden in his father’s
hair the scar from the surgery
INT LENOX HILL HOSPITAL ROOM MORNING

Danny opens his eyes The room is empty except for Matthew
who sits by his bed He wears his trifocals and looks over
various financial documents

Hey my broth-a

MATT

DANNY
Thanks for paying for this The
private room isits not
necessary

MATT

I can get work done this way

DANNY
How is Dad

MATT
I don’t know still Dad But I
was sitting there and I just kept
having this thought This is my
Dad This is myDad This is
the same guy as all the other
times And that thought which has
made me so angry also made me love
him

DANNY
I said goodbye to him so many times
in my head its strange in a way
I wasnt prepared for him to
survive

MATT
Well now we’1ll know what to do
the next time The three of us
had a real rhythm going

DANNY
I just dont want to have to speak
publicly again You know
sometimes I wish Dad had done one
horrible unforgivable thing
Something specific I could be
angry about But it isnt one
thing Its tiny things every
day Its drip drip drip

MATT
Im sorry I couldnt stop the
house and the art from being sold
In the end Maureen was
determined

DANNY
(shrugs )
Im over it

MATT
Im not

Matt rises and removes the Vuarnet sunglasses from his
coat

MATT
I think these are your Vuarnets
DANNY MATT
(takes them) (hesitates )
I thought they were yours Maybe they were mine
DANNY MATT
No I think youre right (reaching for them)
theyre mine Im remembering now owning
them
DANNY

(pulling them away)
They look like a pair I probably
had

Danny puts them on Matt regards him

MATT
You can have them anyway

DANNY
Can you help me walk The nurse
is supposed to be here to do it

Matt helps Danny climb out of the bed

MATT

They continue into the hospital hallway
INT LENOX HILL HOSPITAL HALLWAY
