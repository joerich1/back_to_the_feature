1 EXT FOREST FLOOR - DAY 1

Winter Silence on the forest floor Snow falling Then the
sound of breathing The soft footfall of a person running
HANNA fourteen years old long hair eyes like blue ice
glides through the trees a bow strapped to her shoulder

is dressed in animal skins and fur shoes She blends almost
completely into the landscape of trees and snow

She stops dead Her breath visible in the freezing air
Suddenly alert she has spotted her prey A REINDEER

the snow trying to unearth a patch of grass to eat Its
pops up - danger Too late The sudden swoosh and the snap

an arrow piercing its skin
The deer flops to the ground with a thud It whines its

dig at the earth Its mouth gnaws at the icy air Steam
pouring from its nostrils

HANNA approaches removes a fur glove She bends to her
knees

She reaches out and gently pets the animals frightened face
She runs her hand down along its neck in towards the wound

HANNA
I just missed your heart
She stands and pulls out an old pistol from her waist
holster
She fires two shots directly at CAMERA
CUT TO TITLE HANNA
2 EXT FOREST FLOOR - LATER 2

A knife enters the deer near its anus

HANNA
(WHISPER)
Remove the penis and scrotum make
a deep circular cut around the
rectum
HANNA pulls the knife up towards the brisket

HANNA (CONTD)

(WHISPER)
Cut from the rear to the brisket
She works calmly without expression

3 EXT FOREST FLOOR - LATER 3

The deer lies on its side

HANNA breaths hard She reaches deep into the body cavity
and pulls out intestine stomach liver

She freezes sensing danger

Her hand deep inside the animal She listens She looks out
into the still forest No sound

ERIK mid forties a mammoth with leathery face stands
behind her like a ghost

ERIK

Youre dead Right now Ive

illed you

HANNA spins spraying deer-blood on to the snow and brings
her fist right to ERIKs face He blocks and thumps an open
palm on to HANNAs shoulder sending her sprawling into the
snow

She leaps to her feet as ERIK aims a kick at her head She
dodges punches below his knee cap and goes for her
pistol ERIK slaps the hand away

ERIK (CONTD)

Use your hands

She goes for the gun again and again he stops her

He moves in tight pulling the gun from its holster and

tossing it deep into the forest

HANNA clips ERIKS temple sending him to the ground

She wraps her arms around his neck preparing to snap
but she cant
shows

the

He throws her over his shoulder into a pile of snow
ERIK stands and wipes the snow from his pants His face

a touch of frustration
He plods into the forest

ERIK (CONTD)

Drag it back yourself

HANNA drags herself to the deers side She stares at its
dead face

4 EXT FOREST FLOOR - LATER 4

HANNA clears the kill site Wipes the last dots of blood on
to a stick No sign she was ever there

5 EXT FOREST FLOOR - EVENING 5

HANNA drags the 200 lb deer on a makeshift sled She lifts
her knees high and moves at a steady pace

Hidden among the trees a little way off ERIK is watching
her

6 EXT LOG CABIN NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - EVENING 6

A log cabin built around an ancient tree surrounded by the
thick forest HANNA is standing in the snow stripping the
deer with a knife Its a tough job but she does it no fuss

7 INT LOG CABIN - EVENING 7

Almost everything ERIK and HANNA own theyve made themselves
using what can be found in the forest What few possessions
that have been brought in from the outside world are old and
worn

HANNA is making a fire using a bow drill The friction of

drill produces an ember which HANNA carefully transfers to
some dried leaves

8 INT LOG CABIN - LATER 8
HANNA and ERIK sit either side of a small fire still
dressed

in furs

HANNA swirls a spoon around in a dish of stew ERIK takes a

mouthful watches HANNA not eating

ERIK

HANNA nods

9 INT HANNAS ROOM LOG CABIN - NIGHT 9
HANNA is in bed under fur covers listening while ERIK reads
to her from an old encyclopedia

ERIK
The Great Blue Whale is the largest
animal to have ever existed A blue
whales tongue weighs over two and
a half tons and its mouth is large
enough to hold 90 tons of food and
water

HANNA
How much is that

ERIK

Its bigger than the cabin Its
heart weighs thirteen

hundred pounds and a male has seven
gallons of testicles

HANNA smirks

ERIK (CONTD)

The Blue Whales music can be
heard for over 500 miles

He shuts the book

ERIK (CONTD)
Time for sleep

HANNA
Good night
He stands by her bed looking down at her

ERIK
Did you forget something

HANNA
No
ERIK takes HANNAS gun out of his pocket and puts it on the
table next to her bed

HANNA (CONTD)
Sorry

ERIK
Good night
He walks to the door HANNA stops him with a question
HANNA
Whats music like

ERIK
Its difficult to explain

HANNA
Try
He opens the encyclopedia again leafs through the pages and
reads

ERIK

(READING)
a€Music A combination of sounds
with a view to beauty of form and
expression of emotion

HANNA
But how does it feel
Erik is not equipped to answer such esoteric questions

ERIK
Good It feels good Its uh

HANNA
Tell me properly Can you play
music

ERIK

Your mother could She used to sing
very well

HANNA

ERIK
You will soon enough

HANNA
How soon
Erik looks away from her questioning eyes

ERIK
wattle

out

When youre ready

HANNA
Im ready Im ready already
They look at each other- he weighs it up

ERIK
Just go to sleep now Ill see you
in the morning

Hanna covers herself in an animal skin as ERIK pulls a

screen across her bed strokes her hair gently for a moment
and leaves the room

HANNA reaches under her bed and takes out an old battered
photograph taken 15 years ago of a YOUNG WOMAN with eyes
like hers - her MOTHER JOANNA ZADEK

10 EXT LOG CABIN - MORNING 10

The morning sunlight slants through the forest

ERIK is walking through the trees He stops raises his
pistol at a tree trunk some distance away and fires
The tree breaks apart

11 INT HANNAS ROOM LOG CABIN - MORNING 11

HANNA wakes with the sound of the GUNSHOT She is still
holding her mothers photgraph

HANNA pushes the photograph under her mattress and climbs

of bed

12 EXT LOG CABIN SHOOTING RANGE - MORNING 12

Another GUNSHOT breaks a tree apart

Hanna fires Another tree breaks apart She rolls and
fires

She rolls and fires She reloads And fires

ERIK watching

HANNA attacks ERIK Hand Knee Elbow Fist He defends
easily

ERIK

They reset She repeats the motion Hand Knee Elbow Fist

ERIK (CONTD)

Hand Knee Elbow Fist Shes getting faster Her strikes
are solid

14 EXT LOG CABIN - DAY 14

A medium size log nailed along two pillars of the cabin
acts as a chin-up bar

Erik and Hanna do chin-ups Both are fit Neither will give
up ERIK observing HANNAs power Both have the sense that
he is judging her HANNAs face fiercely determined

15 EXT LOG CABIN - DAY 15

ERIK and HANNA sit with their backs to a tree in the huge
forest as they breathlessly recover from the exhaustion of
the exercise HANNA speaks fast reciting

HANNA
I live in Leipzig German city
Population 07 Million people We
live at Number 7 Weissingerplatz I
go to school at the Klaus Kohle
Gymnasium and my best friends are
Rudi Gunter and Clara Schliess I
like literature and sport in
particular tennis and athletics I
have a dog called Trudi

16 EXT NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - DAY 16

HANNA is running racing ERIK Fierce determination almost
anger in her eyes They reach the river and dive in
the

17 EXT RIVER - DAY 17

HANNA and ERIK are swimming hard against the current of the
fast-flowing river working at full pelt just to stay still
They swim and swim their muscles busting their lungs
bursting

ERIK
Dont give up Dont give up
HANNAs arms flails as she fights against the stream and she
screams in pain She is grabbed under by the undertow and is
pulled downwards For a second she is underwater and in
darkness but ERIKs hand pulls her back up and she breaks

surface with a gasp of relief
18 EXT NORTH SWEDISH FOREST RIVER BANK 18

On the bank HANNA climbs out ERIK approaches her but
moodily even angrily she pushes him away

HANNA
I didnt need your help

Her face sullen she walks away into the forest He stares
after her

19 EXT CABIN - NIGHT 19

Outside ERIK stands alone thinking An OWL swoops down to
catch a mouse then flies back up into the tree tops

20 INT CABIN HANNAS ROOM - NIGHT 20

HANNA is asleep

ERIK enters the room

ERIK approaches the bed and solemnly takes out a pistol and
aims it at HANNA He is tense with expectation

Suddenly HANNA bursts from her covers smashes the pistol
from ERIKs hand and smashes him down on to the bed She
grabs the pistol and points it at his face She is alert
eyes intense face proud She speaks quietly
flint

HANNA
Im ready now

ERIK
Maybe
ERIK relaxes Its a false beat
He lunges again at her really violently He seems to be
really trying to hurt her
But HANNA has reached under her mattress and there is a

knife - in an instant it is at ERIKs neck She pricks his
neck slightly It bleeds just slightly Stillness and
silence HANNA breathless angry

ERIK (CONTD)
You didnt tell me you had a knife

HANNA
You told me to think for myself
Isnt that what you want
She is angry for the first time ERIK does not answer Just
stares at her

HANNA (CONTD)

I want to see things I cant stay
here forever

21 EXT LOG CABIN - NIGHT 21

ERIK takes long lunging strides straight out from the cabin
He counts his paces

ERIK
One two three four

22 EXT FOREST FLOOR - DAY 22

ERIK and HANNA are racing through the forest
Over this we continue to hear ERIK counting his paces from
the previous scene

ERIK (VO)
five six seven eight

23 EXT LOG CABIN - NIGHT 23

ERIK

mine ten
After 10 paces ERIK makes a 90 degree turn and enters the
tree line The snow and mud crunch under his boots
We continue to inter-cut the following with more close-ups

of

HANNA training climbing fighting chin-ups shooting All
the while we continue to hear ERIK counting out his paces
After 40 paces with the cabin light distant ERIK falls to
his knees He unsheathes a large knife and jams it into the
frozen earth

24 EXT NORTH SWEDISH FOREST - MORNING 24

HANNA comes out of the cabin rubbing her eyes and yawning
eating a hunk of cold meat

She looks up to see a snow fox staring at her from the tree
line She crouches and holds out whats left of her
breakfast

The fox approaches gingerly delicately

HANNA
Hello little foxy foxy loxy
come on come and share my

breakfast

The fox comes to her and nervously accepts the scrap
withdrawing a few feet to eat it HANNA shuffles forward
carefully and gently pats the snow fox - it is only a cub

As the fox eats it makes low grunting noises which HANNA

expertly mimics - causing the fox to look up puzzled - they

seem to have a genuine connection - as if theyve done this

before

Suddenly the snow fox freezes pricks up its ears looks up

HANNA looks up too

An aeroplane is approaching overhead The fox darts back
into
the undergrowth as the roar of the plane reverberates

through
the forest
HANNA jumps to her feet and with incredible speed and
dexterity climbs to the very top of a near by tree The
plane

roars over her head and disappears over the snowy
wilderness

oblivious to HANNAS tiny presence

Its only now that we see the full extent of HANNAS

isolation

25 INT CABIN - MORNING 25

HANNA enters breathless with excitement ERIK sits pensively
with his back to the door

HANNA
Did you see it Wasnt it
beautiful like thunder I had to
stick my fingers in my ears it was
so loud Did you hear it
She stops sensing ERIKS mood

HANNA (CONTD)

Whats wrong

Sitting in front of ERIK is a metal case caked with frozen

dirt ERIK pops open the case Inside a tangle of
technology

HANNA looks at the case mesmerized

HANNA (CONTD)
What does it do

ERIK
It tells Marissa Wiegler where we
are
He looks at her a hint of a challenge

ERIK (CONTD)

When you want to leave here all you

have to do is flip that switch

She approaches the box and places a single finger on the
small red switch

ERIK (CONTD)

But once its done therell be no
going back Shell never give up
until youre dead or she is You
understand I wont be there to hold
your hand So be sure Be sure its
what you really want

HANNA
Youre not scaring me
He looks at her disbelievingly
She shakes her head in protest but simultaneously moves
away
from the switch
He softens towards her

ERIK
Its here Theres no rush Take
your time
HANNA turns her back on the box but cant help taking
another look at it over her shoulder

26 INT CABIN HANNAS ROOM - NIGHT 26

HANNA is under the covers again while ERIK reads more from
the encyclopedia

ERIK
Laika a mongrel dog from the
streets of Moscow was the first
animal to orbit the Earth She was
launched into outer space on the
third of November 1957
Scientists believed humans would be
unable to survive conditions of
outer space so flights by animals
were viewed as an experimental
precursor to human missions Her
rocket was not designed to be
retrievable and Laika had always
been intended to die

HANNA
Thats sad
ERIK awkwardly turns the page to change subject

ERIK
When a star collapses the supernova
explosion is 10 billion times
bolts

and

brighter than other stars
HANNA shuts her eyes and tries to imagine how bright that
might be

27 INT LOG CABIN - MORNING 27

ERIK straps the bow to his chest and grabs a quiver of
ERIK

Will you hunt with me
Hanna is sweeping the ground

HANNA
If you want

ERIK
Its up to you

HANNA
Me

ERIK
Yes

HANNA eyes the box sitting open its waiting for her

HANNA
Ill stay

ERIK
Fine
ERIK leaves abruptly
HANNA continues to sweep the ground her movements bring her
closer to the metal box She stops sweeping and looks at the
box She turns and walks out of the cabin

28 EXT LOG CABIN - CONTINUOUS 28

HANNA comes out of the cabin and sits down on a tree trunk
She sees the snow fox cub but says nothing It comes over

noses around the cabin but HANNAS mind is elsewhere

She finds herself in the specialist Military DNA Laboratory
The MILITARY DOCTORS stare at her One of them reaches for

alarm but HANNA is too fast She flies across the desk and
smashing a glass test tube she cuts the doctors neck then
turns and does the same to the other one

HANNA looks round trying to find a way out Then she sees
something on the desk It is a file with a photo of herself
clipped to it and a collection of papers - she scans it and
reads in several places the letters A€eDNAa€l

But before she has time to read properly she hears a female
voice from outside the lab

FEMALE GUARD

The FEMALE GUARD radios off then enters She senses
something

buzz of the labs lighting and the whir of the air-

HANNA is sweating exhausted blinking in the darkness
trying to make out what the light source is

The gradient has got steeper and she starts to slide
backwards on the smooth metal surface She digs her fingers
into the rivets joining the plates of stainless steel

to get a purchase
She summons the last of her strength and reaches a crest

rests a moment then hauls herself over the crest and
immediately starts sliding she tumbles gathering pace
falling down a long chute into the blackness She has no

where she is or whats happening but shes covering a lot

ground

She hits the bottom with a crunch and cries out
When she opens her eyes she sees more tunnel - and at the

light She crawls quickly towards it and stops at a kind of
manhole cover with a sprung lever - she wrenches the lever
and pushes against it After a little effort the cover gives
way and light floods in blinding her

HANNA recovers and tentatively pokes her head out into

81 EXT MOROCCODESERT CONT 81

BLAZING SUN - HANNAs pale face appears eyes crinkled shut
Wider - HANNA emerges from a hole in the ground in the

of a sandblasted desert and slams the cover closed Total
silence now except for the whistle of the wind on sand It
for

takes her eyes a moment to adjust to the blinding light
Blearily she looks out across this alien environment

After a moment her ears prick up She turns just in time to
see a column of Military Jeeps rise over a sand dune in the
distance behind her The jeeps are crawling straight towards
her ominously shimmering in the desert heat She quickly
ducks back down into her rabbit hole and waits

82 EXT MOROCCAN DESERT 82
In the middle of the desert the soldiers convene looking

HANNA A military truck is stationery Nothing around for
miles We hear a military voice on a radio

MILITARY VOICE (VO)

473 are you receiving me Can you
confirm your position Subject has
escaped

83 EXT MOROCCAN DESERT DAY 83

The truck moves off a short distance and stops again
Meanwhile a large convoy of Military Vehicles passes right
over HANNA When it has past she sees the first vehicle
crawling to a halt right near the hole - just yards away
One of the MILITARY PERSONNEL in the jeep gets out and goes
over to the hole lifts the lid inspects the darkness

The Truck radio is on and we hear the voice

MILITARY VOICE
Can you confirm your position 473
Banks Banks can you hear me

Once BANKS is satisfied he walks away a few paces gets out

pair of high powered binoculars looks this way and that
He walks up a dune and scans the dunes with his binoculars
Finally he walks back and climbs into the Jeep gets on the
radio

BANKS
Im at a perimeter opening at the
far east wing Somethings not

quite right

He doesnt notice but the lid is open now and the air-
conditioning duct is empty

CUT TO
As the Jeep moves off we see HANNA is clinging to the axle
hanging upside down underneath Her face is pressed to the
oily metal her back just an inch from the desert floor
flashing beneath her
The jeeps now take a track along the edge of a steep dune
HANNA takes her chance and lets go of her grip She clenches
her eyes shut as the jeep passes over her As soon as the
jeeps clears she rolls herself over the edge of the dune
HANNA rolls down the sand dune at speed until finally she
slows and stops She lies still and shocked by the quiet as
the Jeep disappears into the distance Then she sits up and
looks around herself She has no conception of this
landscape no idea where she might be

ERIK HELLER crawls out He is holding a two year old child

his hands The childs coat is covered in blood
MARISSA stares at the shocked child and takes the rifle to
her eye to shoot again As she does ERIK senses her

and throws himself to the ground

Through the rifle viewfinder we see just a glimpse of ERIK
and the red glare of the coat covered in blood ERIK HELLER
grabbing the child and sprinting for the forest

MARISSA taking aim at HELLER and then firing as HELLER

The sun has dipped a little now the shadows of the dunes
longer but the heat is still intense

HANNAs throat is parched by the dry heat her pale eyes
scorched by the angry sun She walks purposefully but with a
growing awareness of her tiny scale in this seemingly

sea of sand She has no conception of this landscape no
where she might be

HANNA climbs a steep dune eyes down feet pounding A

falls across her path and she looks up to see the shape of a
GIRL standing at the top of the dune silhouetted by the sun
HANNAs hand goes to the concealed gun

The GIRL stares at HANNA They must be about the same age
but there the resemblance ends HANNA dusty bloodied and
bruised in military top trousers and boots stares at this
perfect image of western adolescence Dressed head to toe

in pink and drinking a can of coke no concession to where
she is whatsoever This is SOPHIE LYALL

SOPHIE

HANNA stares at her then abruptly turns to walk in opposite
direction until she sees another convoy of US military

in the distance

HANNA turns back Looks at SOPHIE Like a wary animal

SOPHIE (CONTD)

HANNA is unsure how to speak to this strange person

SOPHIE (CONTD)

assailed by the smells of dried fruit meat tagines

cooking at market stalls fresh fish and meat still bloody
and twitching hanging in the sun for the flies She listens
to the babble of Arabic her ears nose and eyes sensitive

every conversation and twitch of life It all overpoweringly
exotic and visceral to her

An old broken-backed woman inches her way to market HANNA
stares at her in astonishment Her wrinkled skin

She eyes the abundance of animals - animals shes never seen
before in her life Chickens Goats A camel which Hanna
finds bizarre and hilarious

strange encounter and leaves
She just sits there staring at the TV as its volume seems

increase
Meanwhile the electric kettle begins to boil Steam pours
from its spout and the whole contraption starts to rattle
violently

HANNA gets up and approaches the kettle very warily She
tries the light switch in an attempt to stop the kettle but
it keeps boiling and making its strange rattle HANNA tries
another switch the ceiling fan begins to turn confusing
HANNA even more

On the TV the news shows footage of war in the Middle East
the sound of gunfire

The ceiling fan is at its top speed its blades cut the air
like a helicopter

A telephone beside the bed starts to ring

Combined the noises rise to a terrifying crescendo

HANNA backs away towards the bathroom She stumbles and

through the bathroom door straight into the shower
inadvertently turning the taps on Water pours down on her
HANNA springs up and turns to face the stream of water as if
it were an attacker She runs back into the bedroom

In the bedroom the kettle is still having a violent tantrum
the TV is still screaming the fan still cutting the phone
still shouting

waist she doesnt like it He tries to open her mouth with

him to the ground She falls to his side and with one knee
on his back she holds his head about to snap his neck

closest DANCERS also stop dancing and stare

HANNA looks up at SOPHIE Now that she has FELICIANO on the
ground she doesnt know what to do with him

let him go
HANNA leans in to whisper into FELICIANOS ear

HANNA

FELICIANO

HANNA
It was nice
And shes gone pulling SOPHIE away through the crowd

land on a lower container on the other side

HANNA running across the tops of the containers sees the
HENCHMAN appear at the far edge She grabs a discarded

and throws it at the man catching him in the side of the
head - a perfect aim - and he tumbles to the ground

the ground

playground long since reclaimed by nature There are huge
fibreglass dinosaurs toppled over with heads missing and
abandoned dinosaur legs Rising above the park surrounded

a muddy moat is the big wheel now standing at a vertiginous
angle In front of the big wheel is the WILHELM GRIMM HOUSE
The house is a Grimm Brothers fairytale theme 4€Fun House
Its windows long since shuttered vines growing through its
roof

HANNA stands in front of the house in deep anticipation She
walks up the small steps that lead to the front door and
knocks She waits heart sinking at the thought of there
being no-one home Then ever so slightly the door opens and
peering out at her is a man with the sad face of an out of
work clown

HANNA sees the photograph of JOANNA With some trepidation
she moves round the kitchen table and sees the body of

ZADEK The back of KATRINS head is blown clean away The
flies have laid their eggs in the bloody mess of her brain
that spreads across the cheap lino floor

HANNA steps back and gags

She backs out of the kitchen and into the hall Turns and
goes through into the lounge

The lounge has been over thrown Cushions ripped shelving
pulled down HANNA stares at the destruction wrought by
MARISSAS hunt for information

HANNA turns walks back down the hall and passes a door to a
tiny second bedroom She stops and enters

The room had been turned into a home office there are
newspaper clippings relating to JOANNAS MURDER and
photographs of JOANNA herself covering every available wall
space A testament to KATRINS unremitting search for the
truth behind her daughters murder

HANNA begins to search the room for clues Anything that

help her understand who she is and where she came from
Then suddenly she hears a quiet familiar voice

himself on barbed wire He sprints round a corner and sees a
doorway ahead of him He walks towards the doorway

HANNA kicks his foot out of the door Hard

BUSINESSMAN (CONTD)

He barges into the room and grabs her Tries to push her on
to the bed He is strong His words and tone contrasting
violently with his actions

BUSINESSMAN (CONTD)
Be nice Be a nice little dolly
HANNA is thrust on to the bed but suddenly turns him over
her head and smashes him against a cupboard BUSINESSMAN
grabs her hair and throws her on the bed
But now HANNA snaps She starts to roar Its like an

like nothing we have seen before She rips at his face

a glass smashes it and cuts his face with it Pure animal
rage BUSINESSMAN starts to scream blood pouring from his
eyes He collapses on the floor She kicks him punches him
repeatedly in a grief-fuelled rage until she is spent of her
primal fury and falls panting to the floor
next

When she looks up she sees his mangled bloody body lying

to her Not quite dead

HANNA suddenly recoils in horror Shocked by the viciousness
of her actions

Tears begins to run down her cheeks as HANNA grabs the mans
wallet and leaves the room

189 EXT POLISH STREET - NIGHT 189

Shaking in shock HANNAH walks out of the hotel and down the

run faster and faster just running to run out of herself
Finally she stops and is sick She looks up A taxis yellow
light blinks in the darkness She looks at the businessmans
wallet to see how much money is in there She approaches the
taxi

HANNA
I have this much Can you take me
to Galinka

190 EXT POLISH HILL ROAD - NIGHT 190

HANNA is in the taxi as it travels a lonely Polish forest
road through undulating snow-covered hills Cold dawn is
arriving Grey skies lightening through the windscreen Tall
snowy pines tower above the car No one else on the road
just a horse drawn cart guiding cows to pasture It is as if
from a different age Quiet solitary HANNA checks the
paper in her pocket Still there Blood on her hands from

businessman A cut in her arm Carefully secretly she

it clean
Suddenly the taxi stops

DRIVER
This is as far as the money gets
you
HANNA looks out Middle of nowhere

HANNA
How much further

DRIVER
Twelve miles

HANNA
Please
But no smile from him nothing HANNA gets out Starts to
Just

walk as the taxi turns and drives back the way it came

She is alone in the forest freezing shattered hungry

about dawn Cold as hell

She hears a car approach Tries to hail it but it flies past
fast Blows icy air in her face

She continues in the freezing cold - sees the road ahead
ts hilly winding she isnt going to make it Too tired
oo shattered

Time passes Still she walks Dead on her feet Gathering
every ounce of energy

Then the sounds of another car But it too just flies by
ignoring her waves and cries

HANNA almost collapses in frustration But carries on
Carries on walking

Time passes Freezing cold HANNA alone on the road Can she
make it

Then another car HANNA turns waves cries out And almost
magically the car slows and stops The window winds down

old iron gate Rusted locked It has not been opened in a
long time

She stares at the sign tries the gate - yes locked Then

walking towards her The same shoes as in Wilhelms house

MARISSA WIEGLER
HANNA raises her torch beam to see the face of the woman

MARISSA has her gun pointing at HANNA but her expression is
the same sunny uncomplicated smile as earlier Dead

HANNA breathing fast MARISSA speaks in English

MARISSA
Dont worry sweetie I dont want
to hurt you
MARISSAS tone has turned into a twisted interpretation of
maternal care
HANNA does not move Like a wild animal cornered

MARISSA (CONTD)

I could have killed you already

when you were asleep in the car

HANNAS still shaking

HANNA now sees ISAACS and his HENCHMEN three of them all

with hunting rifles All ready to shoot her should she
attack

or run They are some distance away not coming any closer

HANNA
Where are the other children

coming

A HENCHMAN treads carefully down the tunnel We see his

of view through his night vision sight just the dark tunnel
stretching on
Like a ghost HANNAS face appears up close her eyes a

white

She slams the gun back in the HENCHMANS face

Still in night vision we see the fight quick and hard The
flash of a single bullet illuminates his death

Silence once more

HANNA now has the first HENCHMANS rifle

From around the corner into the next tunnel she hears the
sound of feet on dirt She presses herself against the
tunnel waits listening hears the feet again and in one
movement raises the rifle and spins round the corner
Through her night vision sight she sees a deer scared eyes
staring back at her

She releases her grip on the trigger and the deer scampers
into the darkness

HANNA comes into the old laboratory Through her night

sights we see the white tiles and smashed equipment

She senses someone coming after her and ducks behind a lab
bench

A HENCHMAN enters the lab carrying a hand gun and a small
torch His footsteps make a crunching sound as he steps
through the broken glass that litters the floor

HANNA rises from her hiding place and stands straight into
the torch light

She fires but is off target and only catches the HENCHMANS
left arm

He drops his torch which slides across the floor

HANNA comes round the lab bench to where the HENCHMAN should
be lying but hes gone Theres a trail of blood which she
follows to a metal cabinet

She stops at the cabinet and fires three shots into its
flimsy doors

The dead HENCHMAN slides out from the cabinet

HANNA takes the dead mans hand gun and goes to retrieve the
torch
She switches the torch off

203 INT TUNNELS GALINKA 203

ISAACS unnerved presses himself against the wall of the
tunnel He feels something at his legs Points his torch to
find the deer pulling at his trouser leg He shoots it Then
runs further down into the tunnel

Alerted by the sound of ISAACS shot HANNA starts to pursue
her prey

204 INT DORMITORY GALINKA 204

ISAACS is back in the dormitory With torch in hand he
searches under the beds Behind him he hears HANNA enter He
switches off his torch and crawls under a bed

HANNA walks slowly between the beds Under the bed ISAACS is
preparing to fire now watching her feet

Suddenly the bed hes under is lifted straight up in the air
and off him - HANNA has summoned enormous strength and is
clutching the end of the bed He fires hits nothing and she
the

lets go - the bed comes crashing down on him again

His torch rolls away His arms are trapped under the bed
hes unable to move

With all his might ISAACS pushes at the bed and lifts it off
himself

They fight

HANNA picks up the torch and slams the torch across his
temple She grabs him by the hair and smashes his head
repeatedly into the floor - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM - BAM
Silence - hes dead

HANNA sits back on the bed and looks at her bloodied hands -
looks down at what shes done Shocked by her own violence
she begins to cry hot tears of bewilderment

She gets up and runs from the dormitory
