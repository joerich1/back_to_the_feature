matriarch of the Cleary family Next two groomsmen walk the
mother of the bride KATHLEEN-CLEARY to her seat She has the
glow of someone who has been drinking every day for the
last twenty-five years

A cute FLOWER GIRL about seven walks up the aisle
concentrating hard on what shes supposed to be doing She
takes two deliberate steps and them tosses some flower petals

FLOWER GIRL

Noticing that she still has a lot of petals left she empties
the rest of the flowers unto the floor and sits down in the
first aisle

Thank you sir

SEC CLEARY
Maybe you can help explain
something to me
(nedding towards the
corner of the deck)
See that young man over there

John looks to see a young man about 22 Hes an intense
morose artiste

He’s plucking petals off a rose and tossing them into the
ocean watching each petal intently as it falls This is
Secretary Clearys son TODD

FRANKLIN

SEC CLEARY
continuing
Thats my son Todd
(shaking his head
Twenty-two years old The whole
world in front of him Every

‘advantage in life Advantages I

never had Well thats not
exactly true He had the same
advantages I had which is a hell
of a lot of advantages So heres
my question what does he have to
be so morose abeut

I dont know sir Maybe he hasnt
found anything to believe in yet

SEC CLEARY
Oh he says he believes in
(with disdain)
art But all Ive seenhim do is
dribble his own blood on a canvas
then smear it around with a stick
Well some people think thats art

SEC CLEARY
its crap Whatever happened to
public service our obligation to
our fellow man
(noticing a waiter
he holds up his

glass)
Um Franklin My daigquiris at
half mast

the waiter grabs the glass

Jeremy and Gloria are siting in a deserted cove

completely smitten

GLORIA
And so you dove into the icy water
to save him

JEREMY °
Yeah well Im sure anyone would
do the same

GLORIA
Ive always wondered about this
Its so amazing to me Why would
aman risk his own life to save
-the life of someone he doesnt
even know

JEREMY
Well the great 19th century
philosopher Schopenhauer asked
that very question and this is how
he answered it He said that at
that moment when a person sees
another in danger there is a
breaking in of a metaphysical
awareness You know what that
awareness is

GLORIA
(expectantly)
What

JEREMY
That we are all one That
separateness is an illusion That
I am one with everyone

Shes

JEREMY (contd)

The Prime Minister of England my
great Uncle Harry you me the
fat kid on Whats Happening We
are all one

We see a few people slap Sec Cleary on the back and share a
laugh with him

CLAIRE
(continuing)
See Suckling

John laughs Hes finding Claire completely adorable

come to weddings even this one
because they want to believe
theyre in the presence of true
love that true love is possible
Even the lawyers And the sucklers

CLAIRE
True love huh And what is true
love John Ryan

JOHN
Welltrue love is your souls
recognition of its counterpoint
in another

This obviously moves her but she tries to wave it off

CLAIRE
Well that’s a little grandiose

JOHN
Perhaps So are you giving a toast

CLAIRE
Yes Normally Im terrible at
these things but I think this
ones pretty good

She hands John a piece of paper He reads it over
