BEN
- and today it is right that we
should ask ourselves the one most
important question What is the
purpose of these years the purpose
for all this demanding work
the purpose for the sacrifices
made those who love us Were
there NOT a purpose then all of
these past years of struggle of
fierce competition and of uncom-
promising ambition would be mean-
ingless But of course there
is a purpose and I must tell it
to you I ask you to remember
this purpose always and I pledge
that I shall endeavor to carry it
with me forever

apparatus in it

SOUND the rythmic PUMPING of air obliterating the
SOUND of the people around the pool who seem to be
applauding and chattering noiselessly

We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool Mr Braddock
is running back and forth clapping his hands and
delivering his now soundless pitch

We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the
pool Mr Braddock is moving along the side of the pool
motioning toward us to come down to the deep end He
joins Mr Arnold at the far end of the pool They both
begin to motion us toward them

We get to the deep end of the pool Mr Braddock signals
us with his hand to go under He kneels down by the edge
of the pool and reaches out with his hand and pushes us
under He has a big smile

We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look The
figures through the slightly distorted glass of the mask
of Mrs Arnold and Mrs Braddock watching and smiling

the neighbors on each side of the house looking over their
fences and laughing and pointing Mr Arnold nodding

encouragement and talking Mr Braddock on his knees
smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us
under We GO UNDER and SINK to the bottom of the pool
