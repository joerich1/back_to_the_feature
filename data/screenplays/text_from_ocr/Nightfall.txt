On her dresser is some shampoo soap and a box of tampons

MOTHER (OS)

On the wall is a LUNAR CYCLE CALENDAR A large red X is
marked on Today’s date which notes the FULL MOON

Jenny slips on her nightgown and climbs into bed She opens
the bedside drawer and takes out something heavy

She lays back on her pillow and stares out the window eyes
open completely awake

On the bedside table is a 45 MAGNUM

A pair of headlights peak over the hill The car rambles down
the road toward the gas station

He watches as the A BLACK ESCALADE slowly pulls into the
station

Leo cocks the hammer and readies for hell The doors swing
open

A FATHER and his two children get out and run into the mini
mart for some late night rations

Leo stows the gun and tosses the smoke

LEO
Everything’s going to work out

meadow in the woods Nestled between a few trees and behind

The cabin is only one story the foundation made of large
rocks with thick logs constructing the walls A small porch
runs around the perimeter and a stone chimney peaks from the
roof

perfect safe house

They go to the front door

ANGEL
Leo

The outside padlock has been ripped off Leo draws his gun
He grabs the door handle but it’s locked from the inside

It was the blood I could smell it
And once you catch the scent of it
instinct takes over Nothing can
stop it Not even your own flesh
and blood You are all going to die
in this room

Mary screeches out in pain and rips one of the cell bars
free She flings it at the ceiling hitting the overhead
lights They burst in a rain of sparks

The whole room goes dark

Mary collapses on the ground Her skin turns a ghostly white
as the black veins spread over her entire body

Her finger nails pop off replaced by long razor sharp
claws

Long fangs erupt from her jaws but the most unsettling trait
are her eyes

Unnaturally big and wide bulging from the sockets the color
and pupil swallowed by the whiteness They glow as if the
full moon was beaming from inside her head

Mary turns to the ceiling and HOWLS out at the FULL MOON
shining through the SKYLIGHT A demon possessed by its power

SHERIFF LAW
Jesus Buddha and Allah

ANGEL
Let us out I’m pregnant for god’s
sake

Sheriff Law and his Deputies just stand there in a daze
Vincent is amazed by Mary He moves closer and closer

VINCENT

Mary turns her sights on Leo and Angel She lets out a low
growl ready to pounce

ANGEL

LEO
Shoot her

Sheriff Law and his men snap out of it They raise their guns
and fire until their ammo is spent

Mary’s bullet riddled body splatters against the wall

ANGEL (CONT’D)

off an entire herd of cattle ina

He called it the monster with the
full moon eyes

VINCENT

Dell is crushed under the bars from the raw force

Sheriff Law and Deputy Ronny start to reload

Mary leaps on Ronny and tares out his throat

Vincent grabs his gun from the desk and loads it

Leo snatches the shotgun from the wall He turns to Angel

At the moment of impact she leaps and lands on top of the
roof Her claws clamp into the ceiling holding her secure

Leo swerves the car but she’s embedded like a tick
MARY

Rips open the SUNROOF

VINCENT

Fires round after round in to her face It doesn’t even faze
her

Mary reaches in and yanks Leo out of the drivers seat

The Escalade banks out of control right for a massive
REDWOOD TREE

WHAM

Leo and Mary launch from the roof and disappear into the
forest

EXT WOODS -

Leo hits a tree then the ground He rolls out of control
headed straight for

THE EDGE OF A CLIFF -
Below is the freezing rapids of WOLF RIVER

Leo claws at the ground but has to much momentum He falls
over the edge swallowed up by the rapids

MARY
leaps from a tree She looks down at the river from the
cliff no sign of her prey She smells the air catching

another scent and races into the darkness

LEO

ANGEL
But the Sheriff He said there are

LEO
I’d rather face this thing toe to
toe then hide and wait for it to
swallow us

ANGEL
You’re suppose to protect us

LEO
That’s exactly what I am doing You
are just going to have to trust me

He pulls her close and kisses the top of her head

ANGEL
Why is this happening to us Leo

LEO
Sometimes things don’t need a
reason Come on

Leo grabs the duffle bag and turns to exit

BANG

ANGEL

He turns slowly to face Angel His hand is on his stomach
BLOOD seeps through his fingers

Vincent is confused by this but Angel hears him loud and
clear Behind her on the wall impaling Hawaii on the map

The SILVER DAGGER

VINCENT (CONT’D)
More like Sayonara

Vincent points the gun at Leo’s head

Angel grabs the dagger and drives it into Vincent’s shoulder
He drops his gun and Angel knocks him over

LEO
Go

Angel races out the back door
Vincent grabs his gun and fires a spray of lead after her
VINCENT
You can’t escape me I’11 always

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Angel races through the moonlit forest She hides next to a
large redwood and catches her breath

Something moves in the bushes next to her and she freezes

A gentle DEER scampers out into the moonlight scavenging for
fresh vegetation

Angel watches the peaceful creature

MARY

leaps on the DEER and rips its throat out She feeds on the
poor animal unaware of Angel

Angel slowly backs away from the gruesome scene

She turns to run away Her foot catches a root and she trips
Mary’s head snaps up from her feast She sniffs the air
Angel doesn’t move

Mary goes back to eating

Angel grabs a thick sharp tree branch for a weapon and crawls
away on all fours as quietly as she can
EXT TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

Angel crawls from the thick woods and finds the trail She
gets to her feet and heads North

About 20 yards behind her on the trail a FIGURE rises froma
crouched position

It runs up behind her in total silence The glowing eyes let
us know one thing

It’s MARY
She pounces
ANGEL

Turns at the last second The spear-like tree branch braced
against the ground

MARY impales herself on the branch
Angel races into the woods

Mary digs her claws into the branch and pulls it free from
her chest howling in pain

Her wound heals and she leaps after Angel

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Angel runs for her life She can hear Mary crashing after
her She’s getting closer

Angel spots a large rock formation

BUZZARD ROCK

Angel climbs to the top of the rock and has to fight back
the urge to scream when she sees

JENNY SILVER’S remains

Angel hears Mary at the base of the rocks She’1ll be up there
any second

Angel crawls into a crack between the rocks She’s just small
enough to fit inside

MARY

arrives at the peak She freezes when she sees the body of
her dead daughter Mary crawls to Jenny

Angel watches as Mary cradles Jenny running her fingers
through the few strands of hair left on her skull She makes
a primal moan and gently lets her go

Mary climbs off the rock

Angel waits listening for Mary

After an eternity Angel crawls from her hiding place
MARY

blocks the entrance

ANGEL

cowers into the corner of the tiny cave

Mary is to big to fit inside so she reaches in with her arm
Lethal claw swipes are mere inches from Angel’s face

Mary switches to the other arm but Angel is still out of
reach

Mary tries to pry the stones apart but even she isn’t that
strong

Mary slams the stone in one last attempt to break through
but the rock won’t yield

Angel is safe She’11 wait there till morning if she has to
Mary screams at her one last time then leaps away

CUT TO

INT CABIN - NIGHT

Vincent yanks the dagger out of his shoulder Leo watches
fading fast

VINCENT
That stings Not as bad those two
arrows I took in the leg What was
it that crackhead said he was

LEO
An Apache

VINCENT
That’s right He free bases a pound
of rock candy covers his body in
dog shit and is magically
transformed in to a native American
legend If that isn’t a reason to
“Just say no” I don’t know what
is

LEO
Aren’t you suppose to take me in
It’s the law

VINCENT
You know I don’t follow the rules
That was one of the things you
liked about me That’s why we were
able do some much good

LEO
Remember that human trafficking
ring we broke up

LEO (CONTD)
And you let all those little slave
kids attack the two bastards that
ran it

VINCENT
hat’s justice

H

LEO
hey ripped them to pieces

H

VINCENT

Who wouldn’t Stolen from your
family your life to be a sex
slave or worse Those men got what
they deserved

LEO
What was the last good thing you
did

VINCENT

Not giving up on my marriage
Leo chuckles

LEO
Man you’re like those crazy little
kids just trying to get your pound
of flesh

VINCENT
This makes you happy You broke my
heart Leo

LEO
Do you think we’1ll ever get what we
deserve

VINCENT

You’re paying your debt I’m sure I
will too one day But I have the
rest of my life to see that

Leo chuckles again

VINCENT (CONT’D)
What’s so damn funny

LEO
I maybe dead but you’re dinner

Leo nods behind Vincent
MARY
cuts a menacing sight in the doorway She growls at Vincent
VINCENT
Well look at what the wind blew
in Welcome to Grandma’s house
bitch

Vincent opens fire

Mary pounces on Vincent She thrashes him flinging him
across the room

Leo crawls into a corner and watches the carnage unfold

Mary play’s with Vincent tossing him around the room like a
rag doll

Vincent fires his last round at Mary and throws the gun at
her in frustration

VINCENT (CONT’D)
I’m open to suggestions Leo

LEO
Tell her you love her That usually
scares them away

She stalks Vincent into a corner seconds from devouring him

Vincent backs against the wall And that’s when he notices
it

THE SILVER DAGGER
on the ground
Vincent grabs it his last line of defense

Mary stops in her tracks She sniffs the air a moment
There’s something about the dagger that she fears

Vincent picks up on it He smiles looking at the dagger

VINCENT
Don’t like silver do you

Vincent charges

Mary holds her ground

Vincent leaps at her dagger pointed like a missile
They slam against each other and tumble to the ground
Vincent rolls away

Mary turns to attack him but falters

THE SILVER DAGGER

sticks out of her side The poisonous effects taking hold
immediately

Mary falls to all fours
Vincent stands over Mary

VINCENT (CONT’D)
I’m the big bad wolf

Vincent kicks her in the side Mary slams against the wall
and slumps on to the floor

Vincent grabs his pistol and reloads it Then he pulls the
dagger from Mary’s gut and stows it

VINCENT (CONT’D)
Well Leo I have to admit after
everything that has transpired
tonight I think I’ve had a change
of heart I don’t believe I can
save my marriage I am going to end
it

LEO
Vincent

VINCENT
I’1l see you in hell Leo

LEO
Don’t

Vincent exits the cabin heading after Angel

LEO (CONT’D)
Vincent Come back Vincent

CUT TO

EXT BUZZARD ROCK - NIGHT

Angel can’t wait any longer She squeezes out of her hiding
place and looks around

The coast appears clear

EXT WOODS - NIGHT
Angel finds the trail again and heads north for the truck

She doesn’t take three steps before Vincent appears from
behind a tree

VINCENT
Lovely night for a walk

Vincent grabs Angel by the hair

Angel reaches around digging her nails into Vincent’s wound
He screams out

Angel pulls away from Vincent but he won’t let go

They lose their balance in the struggle and fall over
tumbling down the hillside

They come to a stop at the edge of a creek

Angel just missed getting impaled by a sharp stick erupting
from the ground

Vincent wasn’t so lucky He’s smacked his head on a rock and
is slowly coming too

Angel gets to her feet and runs into the woods

CUT TO

INT CABIN - NIGHT

Mary chokes up more silver fluid Her breath labored eyes
glazing over

Leo crawls to her

She looks at him the human part of her returning Mary lets
out a deep pained howl One last breath

They will die with each other on this cold dirty floor

With his last ounce of strength Leo reaches out his arm
pleading Mary to bite him

LEO
I made a promise

Mary turns away not wanting to pass the curse to Leo

She growls at him He has no idea what he is asking If she
couldn’t control it how could he

Leo raises his arm to her jaws

LEO (CONT’D)
God damn it bite me Bite me

Mary closes her eyes and bites deep into his arm

The thick black salvia enters through the puncture marks
running into his blood stream

Mary has passed the CURSE

Leo’s body begins transforming instantly The bullet in his
gut falls out and the lethal wound heals

Shirt and pants tear open hair grows from his flesh teeth
and claws razor sharp and deadly

As Leo changes in to the hulking monster Mary reverts back
into her human form

Leo larger and more fierce stands over Mary’s dead body He
roars out at the cold night

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Angel tumbles through some bushes falling to her knees Her
eyes go wide

It’s the path
She looks up the path and can see the two trucks

VINCENT
Angel

Vincent runs up the trail behind her

Angel scrambles for Leo’s truck

INT LEO’S TRUCK

The drivers side door flies open and Angel climbs in She
puts the key into the ignition but they slip from her hands

Vincent is seconds away

Angel grabs the keys off the floor and puts it into the
ignition

She turns it over
Nothing

She tries to start the truck again and again but all she
gets is a dull clicking sound of the starter

There’s a knock at the window

VINCENT

holding a fist full of wires She’s not going anywhere At
least not in that truck

EXT WOODS - THAT MOMENT

Vincent smashes the window with his pistol and grabs a
handful of Angel’s hair

With one violent tug he rips her out of the drivers seat
and through the window

Angel falls into the dirt Vincent standing over her

VINCENT
You were right There’s no way we
can make this work Too much damage
has been done It is over

ANGEL
Couldn’t you have figured that out
before you ruined my life

VINCENT
It’s all part of the grieving
process
Angel lunges at him but is backhanded with stunning force
Before she can register the pain Vincent grabs her again
slamming her over the hood of the car

Angel tries to get free but he slams her head into the hood
knocking her out

VINCENT
I’m still going to take you for one
last spin around the track before
I trade you in
Vincent starts on her pants then his own

He is just about to pull into her when he senses something A
raw smell hot breath on his neck

There’s someone behind him
Vincent turns quickly gun in one hand cock in the other
A massive form stands before him

It’s a man only twice as big as any he’s seen before It
growls at him

Vincent fires a few rounds into the creatures chest but it
has no effect

LEO
steps out of the shadow revealing the monster he has become

VINCENT
You But

Vincent can’t fathom what happens next
Leo makes two quick swipes with his claws

Vincent’s GUN and COCK fly off into the darkness Vincent
looks down at where his manhood used to be he cries out

VINCENT
No

Leo bites in to Vincent’s throat Blood sprays everywhere

Leo thrashes Vincent flinging his dead body off into the
deep woods He’s never coming back again

As gruesome as this is Angel can’t take her eyes away She
slowly gets to her feet staring in awe at the massive beast
glaring at her

Leo stalks toward Angel who remains frozen against the
truck

Leo comes right to her smelling her body He stops at her
belly sensing the baby inside

She is petrified with fear
Leo snorts at her becoming agitated

ANGEL
Please

Leo shakes his head fighting the urge to rip her apart He
nudges her with his head

Angel is pushed away from the truck She falls to the ground
crawling backwards away from him

Leo snorts and motions his head to the Sheriff’s Truck

Angel looks at the vehicle and back at Leo He makes the same
motion again She understands and gets to her feet

She goes to the Sheriff’s truck and opens the driver-side
door Before climbing in she looks back at the Beast who’s
obviously at odds with himself

She at the beast There is something familiar about him

ANGEL
Leo

Leo howls at the full moon It’s him Somehow she knows it’s
him

ANGEL
Oh god no Leo what have you
done

Angel goes towards him but he growls at her Stay away lady

Leo cocks his head sensing something out in the woods He
raises his nose to the wind and catches a scent

He looks quickly at Angel making the same motion and bark to
get inside the truck then with lightning speed he tears into
the darkened woods

Angel climbs in the Sheriff’s truck and locks the doors

n

he scans the moon lit woods searching for a sign of him
he listens but all she can hear is the soft chirping of
crickets

n

The crickets go silent

It’s an eternity for her in the truck The silence the
waiting

Then she hears it

Somewhere in the woods It sounds like something large
Crashing roaring a battle

And it is getting closer

The truck is shaking

Then silence The stillness of night returns

Angel searches the darkness But there is no sign of Leo
SLAM

Leo crashes onto the hood of the truck His arms and chest
are slashed open He’s hurt bad

ANGEL (CONT’D)
Leo

Angel goes to open the door when she sees it

Erupting from the branches of a mighty redwood tree is an
another MONSTER

BLOOD RED EYES SALIVATING FANGS PIERCING CLAWS

It lands on top of Leo the steel and bone crushing under the
force Grasped tightly in the Monster’s claw something long
shimmering

It is the SILVER DAGGER

The Monster raises the dagger overhead ready to deal the
death blow

ANGEL (CONT’D)
No

The Monster looks from Leo to inside the truck at Angel She
meets the Monster’s eyes and knows just by looking into
them

It is VINCENT

The curse passed into his blood before death could take him
away

Vincent’s eyes narrow with pleasure He’11 kill Leo then eat
her for desert

Angel climbs into the back looking for something

ANGEL (CONT’D)
Come on I know you’re in here

The driver side door swings open

ANGEL (CONT’D)
VINNY

VINCENT looks at her
Angel raises the SHOTGUN
She fires blasting the silver dagger out of his hand

Vincent roars at her

Angel fires another round into his chest knocking him off of
Leo

She continues toward Vincent firing round after round into
him

He yelps with pain as each blast knocks him closer and
closer to the edge of the overlook

Vincent is right on the cliff edge One more blast and he’s a
goner

Angel aims for between the eyes
CLICK
She’s out of ammo

Vincent flexes his entire body The bullets squeeze from his
flesh and he heals

His eyes go red with rage He leaps right for Angel to tear
her head off

LEO

blind-sides Vincent and they tumble into the woods

The two titans go at it in the ultimate battle to the death
They leap between trees clashing biting and thrashing each

other

Leo grabs a boulder and throws it into Vincent’s chest
knocking him senseless

Vincent recovers seconds before Leo pounces He counters with
a fallen tree smashing Leo across the clearing

The two beasts wait for their wounds to heal They take deep
breaths and stalk each other like boxers in a ring

Angel watches from behind a tree when something catches her
eye

Directly between them In the moonlight a glimmer of silver
THE SILVER DAGGER

Vincent sees it too

He charges for the blade Leo catches on and he charges as
well

The two creatures barrel toward each other like runaway
freight trains

WHAMMMMMM

They crush each other fighting with a renewed vicious
energy No creature getting the upper hand

Their attacks and counters are too fast for the human eye
They are a tornado leaving a trail of blood and teeth

Angel sets it in her mind and charges into the fray She just
misses getting her head lopped off by a swipe from Vincent

and reaches for the Silver Dagger
Vincent kicks it away before she can grab it

The silver dagger tumbles deeper into the woods

Angel goes after it as Leo and Vincent continue to tear each
other apart

Vincent gets Leo in a head lock and slams him into a boulder
again and again His skull breaking open blood everywhere

Leo is just a rag doll at this point Vincent lets him fall
on the ground

Vincent snarls He’s going to finish it right here and now

Vincent rips the boulder out of the ground showing his
incredible superhuman strength

Leo wounds begin to heal but it won’t be in time

Vincent holds the arrow shape boulder over Leo’s head He’s
going to crush him like a bug

The moonlight catches a gleam of silver racing through the
air

THUNK

Vincent looks up from Leo to see Angel standing a few yards
away She’s just watching him waiting for him to realize

THE SILVER DAGGER
is sticking out his chest

Just like the map in the cabin Angel threw another bulls-
eye

ANGEL
Sayonara

Vincent steps towards her but his body is already failing
The boulder is to heavy for him He loses his grip and it
falls on top of him

Angel runs to Leo He is still out of it
She goes to Vincent who struggles under the crushing weight

of the boulder As the silvers poison spreads through his
body Vincent transforms back to human form

Angel looks down at him his last word on his last breath

VINCENT
Angel I love

Angel rips the silver dagger out of Vincent’s chest He
expires before he can finish his sentence

ANGEL
No you don’t

Vincent is dead
Angel looks at the silver dagger gleaming in the moon light

She turns to Leo but he’s not there Angel scans the woods
in all directions but there’s no trace of him

ANGEL (CONT’D)
Leo we can figure this out You
can control it I know you can

Angel moves through the woods
ANGEL (CONT’D)
Leo come back Please I can’t do

this without you

Nothing but silence

Angel continues searching in the woods

EXT CABIN - NIGHT

The full moon hangs low in the sky minutes away from falling
behind the mountains bring with it the safety of daylight

Angel approaches the cabin She looks around for a sign of
Leo but finds nothing

She walks up the porch and pauses a moment before stepping
inside

INT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

On the floor is MARY

Her small frail form betrays the monster she had locked
inside Her eyes are wide open looking right at Angel

Angel crouches down next to her and shuts Mary’s eyes

Angel moves over to the map on the wall She runs her hands
over it fingers finding the slice mark finding her new life
in Hawaii

The reality of that dream and the life that could have been
sets in She weeps wishing it were all just a nightmare

Angel quiets herself sensing that she isn’t alone

A massive figure stands just outside the doorway

ANGEL
Leo

The only answer she gets is a growl and the glowing white
eyes

ANGEL (CONT’D)
You can control this I know you
can We can still have our new
life Leo

Leo stalks into the cabin no trace of the man he once was
no recognition like before He is all monster

He ROARS at Angel bares his fangs

ANGEL (CONT’D)
Leo please

Leo lunges for her

Angel dives clear and scrambles into the

KITCHEN

Angel considers running out of the back but an idea takes
hold

She looks at the darkened stairway leading down into the
hidden room
BASEMENT

Angel waits in the darkness for Leo to find her And after a
few moments she hears him

His heavy frame making the wood steps creak under his weight

Angel sees his hairy foot step down on the stair just
overhead

She strikes clamping the IRON SHACKLE around his ankle
Leo jumps over the side demolishing the staircase
Angel scurries to the far corner of the room

Leo lunges for her but she is out of reach and the iron
shackle holds

Her plan worked He’s trapped

ANGEL (CONT’D)
You made a promise Leo To protect
us And you did You saved us

Leo rages but the chain holds

ANGEL
The sun is almost up baby We’11
make it I promise Everything will
be how we want it to

Leo goes to the wall in an attempt to rip the chain free
when his foot catches something on the ground

Angel realizes a moment before he does

She reaches into the small of her back It’s not there
anymore

THE SILVER DAGGER

on the cold dirt floor between them
ANGEL

dives for it

LEO

lunges too

They converge on the dagger

Leo lands on top of Angel

Silence Both of them frozen in time

Leo rolls off Angel his chest frothing with black puss

ANGEL
Leo no

Leo turns back into the man she loves

Angel takes Leo in her arms comforting him in these last
moments

ANGEL (CONT’D)
It’s okay baby I’m here

Leo looks her in the eyes a million things to say

LEO
Angel

ANGEL
Quiet baby You saved us You
saved us

Leo reaches in his pocket and hands her the red ring box

LEO
Surprise

Leo rest his hand on her belly and dies in her arms
Angel weeps rocking back and forth wishing away the pain

A faint glow comes from the staircase followed by beams of
light

DAWN has arrived They were so close

Angel opens the ring box A simple DIAMOND RING Classic
timeless true

She puts the ring on her finger and that’s when she feels
it

Angel runs her hand up the side of her arm till she finds
the source

BLOOD
Somehow someway in the chaos
Leo bit her
CUT TO BLACK

THE CURSE CONTINUES
