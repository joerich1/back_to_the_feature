Crowded Filled with oriental and British merchants
You can buy anything here Electronics Food Any-

RAND PELTZER

walks through the owd An American businessman1-He

wears a tas eful g3y suit Hes thin with distinguished
good looks and thin brown hair Hes 56 years old

Rand looks around fascinated by the vast array of people
and merchandise He stops at a booth A tiny ORIENTAL
WOMAN stands behind the counter Rand gives her a polite
smile

RAND

Hi Im from out of town
on business from the US
The woman nods and smiles

AN ORIENTAL MAN

passes by He is very old Deep wrinkles Long white
hair Ragged clothes A rotted smile Overhearing
Rand the man stops to eavesdrop

RAND

(explaining to

Oriental woman)

Im looking for a present

for my son

The woman nods She searches through her wares She
holds up a basketball Rand shakes his head

RAND

Hes not really involved in

sports

The woman puts away the basketball She picks up a Sony
Walkman Rand again shakes his head

RAND
No I want something unusual
something he cant get at home
something different

A HAND

reaches out and grabs Rands arm Startled he turns

The Oriental man stands before him He stares into Rands
eyes

ORIENTAL MAN
I can help you
He leads Rand away from the booth

ORIENTAL MAN

I offer something very different

Very unusual

Rand is puzzled The Oriental leads him to a doorway

ORIENTAL MAN

Follow me

He opens the door motioning for Rand to follow Rand
pauses skeptical

ORIENTAL MAN

Come Take a look It will cost

you nothing

(a beat)

You wont be disappointed

The Oriental enters Rand shrugs and follows

INSIDE
Rand follows the man up a narrow dark set of stairs
At the top they enter a room

INT ROOM

Dark No windows No furniture Filled with cardboard
boxes and wooden crates

Rand crinkles his nose It suQlls bad in here

The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb He leads the
nervous apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room
The Oriental picks up a small metal box A HIGH PITCHED
GIGGLE echoes from inside the box

Rand is very puzzled

The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates He opens
the box

A TINY CREATURE is inside

The animal is eleven inches tall and stands upright on
two legs It has two arms with small four-fingered
hands Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur The
piercing eyes are big sad Its ears are long and pointed
A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth with small
square teeth
The creature is smiling It lets out a giggle
Rand is delighted and surprised Hes never seen anything
like this The animal is more charming than a Disney
character
The Oriental claps his hands
he creature leaps from the box onto Rands shoulder
he animal licks Rands cheek He laughs amused by the
creature
The Oriental claps his hands again

he creature hops back into the box It stares at Rand
with those cute green eyes

RAND
(to the Oriental)
What is it

ORIENTAL MAN

It is called Mogwai

(a beat)

A very rare and intelligent animal

I found it in the fields near my

home It will obey all orders

It learns fast

The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands

ORIENTAL MAN
(Chinese English

SUBTITLES)

--Mogwai leaps to the ground It scurries across the floor
to a wooden crate

Mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate It tears offa
chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man

He takes the fish Mogwai hops back into the box

Rand shakes his head Amazed by the animal

he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish Juice runs

own his chin He smiles at Rand

ORIENTAL MAN

And if you are ever in need of

a song

He claps his hands to the creature

ORIENTAL MAN
(Chinese English

SUBTITLES)

Music

Mogwai begins to hum in an unearthly falsetto Its
beautiful

Rand watches with wide eyes He feels like a child again

RAND -
How much

ORIENTAL MAN

One hundred American Dollars

Cash

Rand removes five twenties from his wallet He gives
them to the man

The Oriental smiles and claps his hands Mogwai jumps
onto Rands shoulders Rand pets it Mogwai emits a cute
giggle

ORIENTAL MAN
It never sleeps It will eat any-
thing but prefers raw meat

(PAUSE)

It must always be kept indoors during

the day It lives in shadow It

hates bright light Direct sunlight

will kill it

Rand nods He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it
into the box Rand puts the box under his arm The
Oriental smiles
ORIENTAL MAN

Your son will enjoy his new friend

Rand smiles and exits The Oriental takes a bite from
his raw fish
