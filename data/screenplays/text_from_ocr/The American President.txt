SHEPHERDs walking with his personal assistant JANIE a shy
professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old

Hey Cooper

AGENT COOPER
Morning Mr President

SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator As the doors close

JANIE
Mr Rothschild asked to have a moment
with you this morning

SHEPHERD
Is he upset about the speech last night

JANIE
He seemed concerned

SHEPHERD
Well it wouldnt be a Monday morning
unless Lewis was concerned about
something I did Sunday night

The elevator doors open revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD At 32
LEWIS is the Presidents chief domestic policy advisor It
would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night
though that doesnt seem to slow him down

LEWIS
You skipped the whole paragraph

SHEPHERD
(to Janie)
And Monday morning it is
LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
double doors leading to the South Lawn

LEWIS
American can no longer afford to
pretend that they live in a great
societyand then nothing You
dumped the whole handguns paragraph

SHEPHERD
This is a time for prudence Lewis

LEWIS
That was the kick-ass section

The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down
the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West
Wing

SHEPHERD
I thought what with being the
President and all

LEWIS
Sir of course I didnt mean to
imply--

SHEPHERD
I thought youd be turning cartwheels
this morning Lewis -- 63 percent job
approval

LEWIS

Thats great news sir but

They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER whos at work at a patch of
grass

GROUNDKEEPER

Before hes even completed the last syllable of the greeting
JANIE quickly and quietly said--

JANIE

SHEPHERD
Morning Charlie

LEWIS
Sir the press is gonna need an
explanation

SHEPHERD
For what

SHEPHERD LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held
open by an AGENT The conversation continues as they make
their way through the corridors of

INT THE WEST WING - DAY

They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS AIDES
AND OFFICE WORKERS

LEWIS
Because you dropped the whole kick-ass
section now weve got this thing hanging
out there

SHEPHERD
Theres a thing hanging out there

LEWIS
Americans can no longer afford to
pretend that they live in a great
society Then nothing No
explanation No context So now its
just this thing

SHEPHERD
And its hanging out there

LEWIS

SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway calls to a STAFFER--

LEWIS
Mr President I really feel we need
to focus on

SHEPHERD
Lewis however much coffee you drink
in the morning I want you to reduce it
by half

LEWIS
I dont drink coffee

SHEPHERD
Then hit yourself over the head with
a baseball bat would you please

Another STAFFER crosses their path--

JANIE
Happy birthday Laura

SHEPHERD
Hey Laura happy birthday

STAFFER (LAURA)
Thank you sir

Once out of earshot--
SHEPHERD
(to JANIE)

I should send her some flowers

JANIE

And with that they walk through a doorway and into

INT THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

In the OUTER OFFICE MRS CHAPIL the Presidents secretary
is hard at work on a word processor She stands as SHEPHERD
walks in--

MRS CHAPIL
Good morning Mr President

SHEPHERD
Howre you Mrs Chapil

MRS CHAPIL
Fine thank you sir Mr Kodak left
the detailed breakdown of the approval
poll for you He seemed to indicate that
it was very good news

SHEPHERD
Sixty-three percent of it at any rate

And by now theyre in the OVAL OFFICE itself SHEPHERD has
gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight
briefing memos that have been left for him As someone used
to doing six things at once he has no trouble reading
listening and talking at the same time

MRS CHAPIL
Lucy called just a moment ago You
forgot to sign her permission slip
for her class--

JANIE

SHEPHERD
(to JANIE)

WOMAN (0S)
Buenos dias Senor Presidente

This from ROBIN McCALL a strikingly tall black woman and the
Presidents press secretary as she strides into the room

SHEPHERD
Too-tall McCall how was Mexico
ROBIN
I didnt truly appreciate it until I
came back and discovered that America
isnt a great society

LEWIS
(to ROBIN)
He dumped a whole section

SHEPHERD
Now theres a thing hanging out there

ROBIN
Not a great society sir

SHEPHERD
Well with you out of the country it
wasnt Robin Now that youre back
were great again

ROBIN
Theres a press room full of people
saying What did he mean by that

LEWIS
See

SHEPHERD
(re a memo hes been
looking at)
AJ did you get one of these

This is said to A J MACINERNEY as he walks through a
separate entrance on the left side of the room In addition
to being the Presidents Chief of Staff and closest advisor
hes the Presidents closest and oldest friend

AJ
s that the letter from Solomon at
the GDC
SHEPHERD

t would appear to be a letter from
the entire environmental community
These people are outta control

AJ
think theyre just frustrated
Mr President

ROBIN
Are they blaming the President for
global warming

AJ
Well they dont think he caused it
if thats what you mean

(continuing

to SHEPHERD)
Sir Im on the phone with these
people twice a week I honestly
dont know what they want at this
point

LEWIS
What they want is a 20 percent reduction in
fossil fuel emissions

AJ
It wont pass at 20 percent

LEWIS
We havent really tried

AJ
Lewis McSorley McCluskey and Shane
hold too many markers If we try to
push this through and lose there will
be a very loud thud when we hit the
ground and thats not what you want in
an election year

SHEPHERD
Talk to the GDC again AJ Tell them
the President resents the implication
that hes turned his back on the
environment Tell them Ill send 455 to
the floor But were gonna ask for a
10 percent reduction If they want to pull
their support fine At 63 percent job
approval rating I dont need their help
getting a bill passed We gotta get going--
wheres Leon

AJ
(to an AIDE)
Would you call Mr Kodak and tell him
the Presidents--

AJs sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on
pedestrian collision in the outer office--
MRS CHAPIL (0S)
Aaagh

KODAK (0S)
Sorry Sorry my fault

AJ
(to the AIDE)
Never mind

LEON KODAK comes into the oval office The White House
pollster is a likable if clumsy numbers whiz He along
with AJ LEWIS and ROBIN are regarded as the Presidents
Starting Team The people in this room have grown very close
over the past few years

KODAK
Excuse me Good morning Mr President

SHEPHERD
You all right

KODAK
They keep moving that big ficus plant

AJ
Were all here Mr President

SHEPHERD
Okay First I wanted to say
congratulations Three years ago we
were elected to the White House by
one of the narrowest margins in history
and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
registered voters think were doing a
good job

KODAK
Wait a second You wanted me to poll
registered voters

Everyone LAUGHS even SHEPHERD smiles

SHEPHERD
But the poll also tells us what we
already knew We dont get this
crime bill of ours through Congress
and these numbers are gonna be a
memory So starting today were
shifting it into gear

ROBIN
Can I tell my morning press gaggle
that gun control--

AJ
Crime control Robin Gun control
means were wimps and were soft on
crime

LEWIS
Hang on are we not--

AJ
Lewis--

LEWIS
Are we not putting back the handgun
restrictions

AJ
Were leaving em out

LEWIS
Sir we campaigned on this issue
Now I understand we took it out when
we were in the low forties but we
can push it through now

SHEPHERD
After the elections

LEWIS
Sir we may never have an opportunity
like this again Lets take this 63
percent out for a spin and see what
it can do

SHEPHERD
We cant take it out for a spin Lewis
We need it to get re-elected For
reasons passing understanding people
do not relate guns to gun-related crime

AJ
Robin you can brief the press this
afternoon As of today the crime
bills priority one on the Presidents
domestic agenda

ROBIN
Got it
Leon youre gonna run the war room
Were gonna need detailed projections
for all the target districts by the
end of the week And Leon dont be
a nice sweet guy from Brooklyn Do
what the NRA does

KODAK
Scare the shit out of em

AJ
Yeah

KODAK
I can do that

AJ
Lewis we want you to be legislative
liaison on this Youre gonna run
the show on the hill

LEWIS
Can I just say to return to the
subject for one moment that it might
be easier to fight a war on drugs if
we werent arming drug dealers

SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a
temper

SHEPHERD
Lewis weve gotta fight the fights
we can win

LEWIS
Yes sir

AJ
We want to announce the crime bill at
the State of the Union which is 72
days from today The last nose count

Sydney we should leave Mr MacInerney

SUSAN
Sir Ms Wades been thrown into the

CUT TO
deep end of the pool on her first day

She hasnt
the report

SYDNEY -- whose b
check her swing

instead to hit t
this as if they w

Youre rig

even had a chance to read
of the Quebec Conference

rain is telling her to slam on the brakes
smile and leave the building -- decides

he gas and swing away The OTHERS are watching
ere watching the evolution of a train wreck

SYDNEY
ht I havent read it If

someone had asked me yesterday Id
have told them the Quebec Conference

was made u
teams But
time for t

p of six professional hockey
what I do know is that its
he President to run for

president again Leon Kodak is as good

as it gets
strategy

when it comes to electoral

and Im certain hes told the

President exactly what Id tell him
Nail down Michigan and California

where they
and burn p
I had read

make cars and airplanes --
lenty of fossil fuel But if
these eight hundred pages

I would have discovered that its the

burning of

fossil fuels thats been

mostly responsible for global warming and

that the 2
by the GDC

0 percent reduction recommended
is a necessary first step

toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse
effect that has gone unchecked by this
administration

SUSAN
(to SYDNEY)

Its really time to--

Susan I p

SYDNEY
romise you the White House

Chief of Staff will not let us leave

here until

hes broken the bad news

No one in the room really understands whats going on

except AJ who
SYDNEY but of co

Im afraid

would like to take the time to admire
urse cant

AJ
(pause)
Sydneys right Although

not about Michigan and California
The President has asked me to convey
to you that hes sending his energy
bill to the floor with a call fora
reduction of 10 percent

Theres an uncomfortable silence in the room

AJ
(continuing)
The President is willing to go it
alone on this but hes asking for
and frankly hes expecting the full
support of the GDC

SYDNEY
The Presidents expecting our full
support

AJ
Yes he is

SYDNEY

The Presidents dreamin AJ

SUSAN
Sydney

SYDNEY
--the President has critically
misjudged reality If he honestly
thinks that the environmental
community is going to whistle a
happy tune while rallying support
around this pitifully lame mockery of
environmental leadership just because
hes a nice guy and hes done better
than his predecessors then your boss
is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland

VOICE (0S)
Lets take him out back and beat the
shit out of him

SYDNEYs blown out her speakers because shes turned in the
direction of the private office entrance to see live and in
person The President of the United States

She is frozen Mortified If she were capable of thought
process she would be preying for something heavy to fall on
her head right now

AJ
Good morning Mr President How are

I apologize for the interruption but

intimidating
(calling)
Janie
JANIE

SHEPHERD
(to SYDNEY)

This is my personal assistant Janie
Basdin Janie would you show Ms
Wade into the rec room Ill be there

SHEPHERD enters a doorway off of the hall SYDNEY continues
down the hallway

JANIE
(to SYDNEY)
This way

JANIE leads SYDNEY into

INT THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

where SYDNEY just stands uncomfortably not knowing
whether to sit or stand Waiting Trying -- the way a jumper
on a window ledge tries not to look down -- trying not to
notice things like the JFK Desk the Seal of the President of
the United States the bust of Lincoln

SHEPHERD strides in--

SHEPHERD
Sorry to keep you waiting

SYDNEY
Mr President--

SHEPHERD
Is it okay if I call you Sydney

SYDNEY
Of course Mr President--

SHEPHERD
Have you ever been in the Oval Office

SYDNEY
Ive just been on the regular tour
It didnt include

SHEPHERD
I hear its pretty good

SYDNEY
Mr President what you saw in there
was nothing more than vanity run amok
I was showing off for a colleague who
doesnt think very much of me Itd
be a real injustice for you to hold the
GDC accountable for my behavior today
On top of which Im monumentally sorry
for having insulted you like that

SHEPHERD
Are you under the impression that Im
mad at you

SYDNEY
(pause)
Well

SHEPHERD
Sydney seldom does a day go by that
Im not burned in effigy

SYDNEY
Not by a professional political
operative standing 30 feet from the
Oval Office

SHEPHERD
No Ill give you that

SYDNEY
Mr President--

SHEPHERD
Did you know that when the City
Planners sat down to design
Washington DC their intention was
to build a city that would intimidate
and humble foreign heads of state
ts true

SYDNEY
didnt know that

SHEPHERD

he White House has the single
greatest home court advantage in the
modern world

fq

SYDNEY
Learned that one the hard way

SHEPHERD
Sydney this bill is important to me

SYDNEY
Yes sir Ill convey your message
SHEPHERD
But you dont believe me

SYDNEY
The GDC is asking for 20 percent sir

SHEPHERD
Its not gonna pass at 20 percent
Its a long shot at 10

SYDNEY
How do you know that until you put
the full weight of the White House
behind--

SHEPHERD
Sydney at 20 percent we are 34 votes
shy in the House It cant be done
But I tell you what Ill make you a
deal with you If you can get 24
votes Ill get you the last 10

SYDNEY
Twenty-four votes

SHEPHERD
If you can swing 24 votes by the
State of the Union Ill promise you
full White House support

SYDNEY
Do I have your word on that sir

SHEPHERD
Absolutely Listen are you hungry
I skipped breakfast You wanna have
some coffee A donut or something

SYDNEY
Sir Im a little intimidated by my
surroundings and yes Ive gotten
off to a rocky and somewhat stilted
beginning but dont let that
diminish the weight of my message
The GDC has been at every president
for the last decade and a half that
global warming is a calamity the
effects of which will be second only
to nuclear war The best scientists
in the world have given you every
reason to take the GDC seriously
But Im gonna give you one more If

you dont live up to the deal you
just made come New Hampshire were
gonna go shopping for a new candidate

SYDNEY heads for the door--

SHEPHERD
You cant do that Sydney

SYDNEY
With all due respect Mr President
whos gonna stop me

SHEPHERD
Well if you go through that door
the United States Secret Service
Thats my private office
(pointing)
You need to go out that way

SYDNEY

(beat)
Ah

SYDNEY with as much dignity as she can muster leaves the
Oval Office SHEPHERD muses about what has just transpired

INT THE BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

SHEPHERD has converted one of the rooms on the second floor
residence His expert shot demonstrates that playing pool is
something he does almost as well as being President AJ
stands to the side with his pool cue

AJ
McSorley McCluskey and Shane know
were making our move on the crime
bill Theyre circling the wagons on
the assault weapons

SHEPHERD
Should I meet with them

AJ
Let Lewis take a pass at them first

SHEPHERD
Fine 2 in the side

SHEPHERD sends the two-ball flying into the corner pocket
AJ
Nice shot Mr President

SHEPHERD
Nice shot Mr President You wont
call me by my name when were playing
pool

AJ assesses the table

AJ
I will not do it playing pool I will
not do it in a school I do not like
green eggs and ham I do not like
them Sam I am

SHEPHERD
At ease AJ and get away from the
pocket 9 in the corner

SHEPHERD makes the shot

AJ

Leo Solomon phoned He said he was
thrilled with the deal you made this
morning

SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a momenttrying to think it
there was something he was supposed to tell AJ

SHEPHERD
forgot to tell you

AJ
ts a waste of time

SHEPHERD
Not our time GDC makes a big
push for the votes and when they
come up short we move in with the
softer bill to get passed were
everybodys hero 3 in the side

AJ
Also Sydney Wade called

SHEPHERD a hair too excited by this news misses by a mile

SHEPHERD
Sydney Wade
AJ
(beat)
She wanted to apologize one more time
for her behavior 3 in the side

SHEPHERD
Did she say anything about me

AJ
(beat)
Sydney Wade
SHEPHERD

When she called

AJ
Did she say anything about you
13 in the corner

SHEPHERD
No its just that we had a nice
couple of minutes together She
threatened me and I patronized her
and we didnt have anything to eat
but I thought there was a connection

AJ is staring at him in disbelief

SHEPHERD
She didnt say anything about me

AJ
(quietly)
Well no but I could pass her a note
before study hall and--

SHEPHERD
Tell me this Hypothetically what
would happen--

AJ
I feel a nightmare coming on 1 in
the corner

He misses the shot

SHEPHERD
--if I called Sydney and asked her
to be my date at the State Dinner
Thursday night

AJ
Youre not serious

SHEPHERD
Dont I sound serious

AJ
The President cant just go out on
a date

SHEPHERD
Why not Jefferson did Wilson did

AJ
Youre not--

SHEPHERD
Wilson was widowed during his first
term He meets a woman named Edith
Gault He dated her courted her
married her and somewhere in there
managed to form the League of Nations

AJ
Mr President this is an election
year If youre looking for female
companionship we can make
arrangements thatll insure total
privacy and--

SHEPHERD
I dont want you to get me a girl
AJ What is this Vegas

AJ
No sir this is the White House

SHEPHERD
And Im talking about something
that in no way is at conflict with
my oath of office Im a single
adult and I met a woman that Id
like to see again socially Hows
that different from what Wilson did

AJ
The difference is he didnt have to
be the president on television
Youve said it a million times
If there were a television set in every
living room 60 years ago this country
does not elect a man in a wheelchair
SHEPHERD
What are you saying

AJ
Well take a hit

SHEPHERD
How big

AJ
I dont know Five points Maybe
more

SHEPHERD
Five points were standing here
talking about

AJ
It could be more

SHEPHERD
I drop five points when Wisconsin
doesnt make it to the Rose Bowl
5 in the corner

AJ
Do you want me to have Kodak put
together some numbers so we know
what were talking about

SHEPHERD

Yeah
(beat)

No No I dont want to check a
polling sample to see if this is
okay like Im asking permission
to stay out an hour past curfew
This isnt the business of the
American people

AJ
Mr President the American people
have a funny way of deciding on
their own what is and what is not
their business

SHEPHERD
I like her AJ
(pause)
Stop being my chief of staff for one
minute
AJ
(beat)
Give her a call

SHEPHERD
(calling out)
Janie
(to AJ)

AJ

MADAME DASTIER

SHEPHERD
Sydney you didnt dissolve the NATO
treaty did you

SYDNEY
I just said that were sitting in this
beautiful room listening to the music
of this wonderful orchestra and I
wondered why nobody was dancing

DASTIER
And I informed Ms Wade that in my
country a guest at the palace of
Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would
soon find their head in a guillotine
if they made the impertinent gesture
of dancing without so much as a
by-your-leave from the King and the Queen

AJ
Ill bet no one accused Louis of
being soft on crime

SYDNEY
Theres a lesson there Mr President

RUMSON
Because it couldnt Our polling
told us that attacking his character
less than a year after hed lost his
wife was gonna be a turn-off and was
gonna make people feel sorry for him
We couldnt run the campaign we wanted
because the opponent was a widower

SYDNEY
Thats not what I

SHEPHERD
didnt think so Listen

SYDNEY
ve really enjoyed the time weve
spent together but this has
catastrophe written all over it
Please Mr President dont pursue
me outside the political arena

SHEPHERD
Well I have no intention of pursuing
you inside the political arena so
that leaves everything out and
thats unacceptable to me
SYDNEY
If I were on your staff I would tell
you that the absolute worst thing you
can do coming into an election year
is to open yourself up to character
attacks and the fastest way to do
that is to prance around like the
playboy of the Western world

SHEPHERD
Lets clear up a couple of things
Number 1 I seldom prance
Number 2 I have no intention of
engaging in a character debate and
Number 3 Youre not on my staff

SYDNEY
Yes of course but if youll follow
the immutable--

SHEPHERD
Why is that by the way

SYDNEY
Whys that

SHEPHERD
Why arent you on my staff

SYDNEY
You cant afford me

SHEPHERD
How much do you make

SYDNEY
More than you do Mr President

SHEPHERD

you make

SYDNEY
What the hell does it matter how
much money I--

SHEPHERD
You would raise your voice to the
President

SYDNEY
Im only thinking about the health
of your Presidency You think this
mornings press conference was the
end of it Bob Rumsons gotta be
drooling over this

SHEPHERD
Are you attracted to me

SYDNEY
I beg your pardon

SHEPHERD
I asked if--

SYDNEY
(of course she is)
Thats not the issue--

SHEPHERD
Well I tell you what Lets make
it the issue Lets try something
new ‘cause I know that most couples
when theyre first getting together
are inclined to slam on the brakes
because theyre concerned about Bob
Rumsons drool

SYDNEY
Youre not most people

SHEPHERD
You know what your problem is

SYDNEY
Whats my problem

SHEPHERD
Sex and nervousness

SYDNEY
Sex and nervousness is my problem

SHEPHERD
Yes Last night when we were
looking at the different place
settings in the dish room I
realized that those place settings
were provided by the First Ladies
And Ill bet none of those First
Ladies were nervous about having
sex with their President husbands
And you know why
SYDNEY
No but Im sure youll explain it
to me

SHEPHERD
I will Because they werent
presidents when they met them Not
the case here

SYDNEY
Ahhhhhh

SHEPHERD
You see what Im getting at

SYDNEY
Yes May I use your bathroom for a
moment

SHEPHERD

Sure Its right through there

SYDNEY
I want to freshen up

SHEPHERD
As you pass through youll see a
large closet on your left And if
you feel comfortable hang up your
coat and when you come back Ill
have fixed up a drink well sit on
the couch and I will explain to
you my plan

SYDNEY
You have a plan Dont make me
wait Youre ona roll

SYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOMDRESSING ROOM area
SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a
couple of drinks

SHEPHERD

(speaking up)
Okay Youre attracted to me but
the idea of physical intimacy is
uncomfortable because you only know
me as the President Its not always
gonna be that way and the reason I
know that is because there was a
moment last night when you were with
me and not the President and I know
what a big step that was for you
So Sydney Im in no rush Heres
my plan Were gonna slow down

When youre comfortable thats

when itll happen

SYDNEY comes back into the roomshes wearing one of
SHEPHERDs dress shirts and nothing else She walks toward
him

SHEPHERD
(continuing)
Perhaps I didnt properly explain
the fundamentals of the Slow Down
plan

SYDNEY
You explained it great

She moves closer to him
SHEPHERD

(pause)
Are you nervous

SYDNEY
No

SHEPHERD
Good My nervousness exists on
several levels Number 1 -- and

this is in no particular order --

I havent done this in a pretty

long time Number 2 Any expectations
you might have due to the fact that
Im you know

SYDNEY
The most powerful man in the world

SHEPHERD
Exactly thank you Just so you
remember thats a political
distinction that comes with the
office I mean if Eisenhower were
here instead of me hed be dead by

AJ
Lewis shut up

Theres a horrible silence in the room SHEPHERD has locked
eyes with LEWIS

SHEPHERD
You got something to say to me

LEWIS
Respectfully sir I think we should
examine the new poll for more than
its value as a box score

SHEPHERD
Examine what They dont like that
Im going out with Sydney

LEWIS
Its not that simple sir I think
this poll helps bribg a murky problem
into specific relief

SHEPHERD
Whose problem we talking about
Lewis Yours You worried about
your job This poll isnt talking
about my Presidency This poll is
talking about my life Two hundred
and sixty-four million people have
decided--

LEWIS
Mr President two hundred and sixty-
four million people dont give a damn
about your life They give a damn about
their own

AJ
All right thats enough

LEWIS
Mr President youve raised a
daughter almost entirely on your own
and shes terrific What does it say
to you that in the last seven weeks
59 percent of this country has begun
to question your family values

AJ
The President doesnt answer to you
Lewis

LEWIS
h yes he does AJ Ima citizen
his is my president and in this
ountry it is not only permissible to
uestion our leaders it is our
esponsibility But you already know
hat Mr President because you have
deeper love of this country than
ny man Ive ever known and I want
o know what it says to you that in
he past seven weeks 59 percent of
Americans have begun to question your
patriotism

tar eeatkgackoe

SHEPHERD
Look if people want to listen to Bob
Rumson-—

LEWIS

They dont have a choice Rob
Rumsons the only one doing the
talking People want leadership
And in the absence of genuine
leadership they will listen to
anyone who steps up to the
microphone They want leadership
Mr President Theyre so thirsty

fq

for it theyll crawl through the
desert toward a mirage and when
they discover theres no water
theyll drink the sand

SHEPHERD

(evenly)
Lewis weve had Presidents who were
beloved who couldnt find a coherent
sentence with two hands anda
flashlight People dont drink the
sand cause theyre thirsty Lewis
They drink it cause they dont know
the difference

The room is slightly stunned by what their President has just
said

SHEPHERD picks up the polling data and heads to the door

be able to get me a job

SHEPHERD
When did you decide to get a new job

SYDNEY
Not long after Leo Solomon fired me
from my old one Beths gonna kill
me She loves that--

SHEPHERD
Why did he fire you

SYDNEY
Total failure to achieve any of the
objectives for which I was hired I
told him he was being unreasonable
After all I did get to dance with
the President and ride in Air Force
One a couple of times But you know
those prickly environmentalists
Its always gonna be something with
them If its not clean air then
its clean water Like it isnt good
enough that Im on the cover of
People Magazine

SHEPHERD
Ill call him

SYDNEY
Youll call him You mean youll
call him yourself Personally
Itll come from the President
Thats a great idea I think you
should call Leo and make a deal He
hires me back for say 72 days I
go around scaring the hell out of
Congress making them think that the
Presidents about to drive through a
very damaging and costly bill
Theyll believe me right cause Im
the Presidents Friday Night Girl
Now I dont know if you can dip into
this well twice especially since
ve lost all credibility in politics
but you never know I might just be
able to pull it off again I might
be able to give you just the leverage
you need to pass some ground-breaking
piece of crime legislation -- like a
mandatory three-day waiting period
before a five-year-old can buy an Uzi
Fuck the sweater -- shell have to
learn to live with disappointment

She starts to exit

SHEPHERD
What do you think went on here today

She stops

SYDNEY
I know exactly what went on here
today I got screwed You saw the
poll you needed the crime bill
you couldnt get it on your own
so I got screwed
SHEPHERD

The environment got screwed Nothing
happened to you today Sydney
Governing is choosing Governing is
prioritizing Ive made no secret of
the fact that the crime bill was my
top priority

SYDNEY
Well then congratulations Its
only taken you three years to put
together crime prevention legislation
that has no hope of preventing crime

SYDNEY heads out the door--

SHEPHERD

Sydney Please I dont want to
lose you over this

Has he lied
SHEPHERD

Other than not knowing the difference
between Harvard and Stanford has he
said something that isnt true Am
I not a Commander-in-Chief whos
never served in the military Am I
not opposed to a Constitutional
amendment banning flag burning Am

I not an unmarried father who was
sharing a bed with a liberal lobbyist
down the hall from my twelve-year-old
daughter

AJ
And you think youre wrong

SHEPHERD
I dont think you win elections by
telling 59 percent of the people that
they are

AJ
We fight the fights we can win

SHEPHERD
Dont--

AJ
You fight the fights that need
fighting

SHEPHERD

Is the view pretty good from the
cheap seats AJ

AJ
I beg your pardon

SHEPHERD
It occurs to me that in 25 years Ive
never seen your name on a ballot
Why have you always been standing a

Youre not hungry

LUCY

SHEPHERD
Yeah

LUCY
We never have oatmeal

SHEPHERD

LUCY
Im from Wisconsin I need food

SHEPHERD
Youre not from Wisconsin Im from

Washington your whole life

He glances toward the TV screen ROBINs standing up there
doing what shes been told No commentNo this President

is not participating in character debates He mutes the
volume
SHEPHERD
(continuing)

How are you doing in your
Constitutional debates

LUCY
Were done

SHEPHERD
Youre done

LUCY

We ratified it last week

SHEPHERD
Ohwellthats good Why didnt
you tell me

LUCY
Its not a big deal Dad
SHEPHERD
Okay I give up I dont care why
youre not happy in social studies
I care about why youre not talking
to me about why youre not happy in
social studies

LUCY
Dad Im perfectly--

SHEPHERD
Youre not perfectly happy You
dont think I know when somethings
bothering you

LUCY
Damnit Dad

SHEPHERD
Hey

LUCY
You know-—

SHEPHERD
Talk to me

LUCY
Look--

LUCY winds herself up It would appear shes about to burst
Shes about to say the hardest thing shes ever had to say in
her life--

LUCY
(continuing)
--sometimes when you talk you say
things I disagree with

SHEPHERD is stunned and totally confused

SHEPHERD
Almost every time I talk I say
things you disagree with

LUCY
I mean politically

SHEPHERD
(pause)
Politically
LUCY
Yes

SHEPHERD
(pause)
What do you mean

It just starts spilling out in a stream--

LUCY
Yes Okay Yes Sometimes I mean
Im not sure You know a lot more
than I do -- but still I have these
feelings and I dont think theyre
wrong Like okay for instance Im
not so sure its all right to burn a
flag I mean it really bothers a lot
of people and I dont know why you
think its okay I hear Senator
Rumson talk and some of the things
he says sounds right to me and I
think God am I like Bob Rumson
I mean Dad thinks hes a jerk Dad
hates this guy
Why am I agreeing with him And then
I think Well maybe Im not really
like Bob Rumson but maybe Im not
like Dad either But the point is
Im the Presidents kid and people
pay attention to what I say and if
I say something different from what
you say itll be embarrassing for
you So I cant just get up in social
studies class and say whatever I want

SHEPHERD is silenttotally blown awayhe had absolutely
no idea

He stands up slowly and moves toward herLUCY doesnt know
whats coming

SHEPHERD
(quietly)
Stand up please
LUCY gets up slowly

Shes never seen her father like this

SHEPHERD
(continuing)
I want you to pay very close
attention to what happens now

SHEPHERD knees down cups her daughters face in his hands
and gently kisses her forehead He pulls her to him and
holds her in a tight embrace

SHEPHERD

(continuing)
In your lifetime you will never
embarrass me It could never happen
Youre not the Presidents daughter
Lucy youre mine
And no ones gonna vote me out of
that job Youre my daughter and
everything else is a distant second

School is for you Lucy You say
what you want The only thing you
have to do to make me happy is
come home at the end of the day

LUCY squeezes her dad tightthey hold the embrace for a
long moment

SHEPHERD

(continuing)
One more thing I dont dislike
Senator Rumson because of his
political views And even if you
voted for everything he would vote
for that wouldnt make you like him
Theres a fundamental difference

between you and the Bob Rumsons of

the world

LUCY
Whats that

SHEPHERD

The difference is that he says he
loves America Saying you love
America is easy What takes
character -- and this is what you
have--

SHEPHERD trails off realizing hes about to quote Sydney

SHEPHERD
(continuing)
What takes character is loving
Americans
(beat)

And now its as if SHEPHERD is waking himself up from the
longest trip of his life

-he looks over at the TV monitorNo comment
No I dont know how many other ways I can say it The
White House isnt getting involved in

Robin will the President ever
respond to Senator Rumsons
question about being a member of
the American Civil Liberties Union

But instead of hands going up the PRESS CORPS suddenly
stands ROBIN turns to see SHEPHERD stride in and step up to
the podium

SHEPHERD
Yes he will Morning

ROBIN
Good morning Mr President

SHEPHERD takes the podium Theres a palpable BUZZ in the
room as video operators adjust their equipment etc People
starts to stand

SHEPHERD
Thats all right you can keep your
seats For the last couple of
months Senator Rumson has suggested
that being president of this country
was to a certain extent about
character

ANGLE - ROBIN

whos picked up the receiver from a wall phone and punches in
four numbers

She turns in to the wall to shield her conversation from the
rest of the room

ROBIN
(into phone)
Lewiscall AJ and come on down
hereI dont know but
somethings happening

SHEPHERD
and although I have not been
willing to engage in his attacks on
me Ive been here three years and
three days and I can tell you
without hesitation Being President
of this country is entirely about
character

LEWIS enters with AJ and KODAK

SHEPHERD

(continuing)
For the record Yes I am a card-
carrying member of the ACLU But
the more important question is why
arent you Bob This is an
organization whose sole purpose is to
defend the Bill of Rights so it
naturally begs the questions

SHEPHERD
(continuing)
Why would a senator his partys most
powerful spokesman and a candidate
for president choose to reject
upholding the Constitution If you
can answer that question then
folks youre smarter than I am
because I didnt understand it until
a couple of minutes ago Everybody
knows American isnt easy America is
advanced citizenship

SHEPHERD

(continuing)
You gotta want it bad cause its
gonna put up a fight Its gonna
say You want free speech Lets
see you acknowledge a man whose words
make your blood boil whos standing
center stage and advocating at the
top of his lungs that which you
would spend a lifetime opposing at the
top of yours You want to claim
this land as the land of the free
then the symbol of your country cant
just be a flag the symbol also has
to be one of its citizens exercising
his right to burn that flag in
protest Show me that defend that
celebrate that in your classrooms
Then you can stand up and sing about
the land of the free Ive known Bob
Rumson for years Ive been operating
under the assumption that the reason
Bob devotes so much time and energy to
shouting at the rain was that he simply
didnt get it Well I was wrong

SHEPHERD
(continuing)
Bobs problem isnt that he doesnt
get it Bobs problem is that he
cant sell it Nobody has ever won
an election by talking about what I
was just talking about

SHEPHERD

(continuing)
This is a country made up of people
with hard jobs that theyre terrified
of losing The roots of freedom are
of little or no interest to them at
the moment We are a nation afraid
to go out at night Were a society
that has assigned low priority to
education and has looked the other
way while our public schools have
been decimated We have serious
problems to solve and we need
serious men to solve them And
whatever your particular problem is
friend I promise you Bob Rumson is
not the least bit interested in
solving it He is interested in two
things and two things only Making
you afraid of it and telling you
whos to blame for it That ladies
and gentlemen is how you win
elections You gather a group of
middle-aged middle-class middle-
income voters who remember with
longing an easier time and you talk
to them about family and American
values and personal character Then
you have an old photo of the
Presidents girlfriend You scream
about patriotism and you tell them
shes to blame for their lot in life
you go on television and you call her
a whore Sydney Ellen Wade has done
nothing to you Bob She has done
nothing but put herself through law
school prosecute criminals for five
years represent the interests of
public school teachers for two years
and lobby for the safety of our
natural resources

SHEPHERD

(continuing)
You want a character debate Fine
but you better stick with me cause
Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your
league Ive loved two women in my
life I lost one to cancer and I
lost the other cause I was so busy
keeping my job I forgot to do my job
Well that ends right now

SHEPHERD

(continuing)
Tomorrow morning the White House is
sending a bill to Congress for its
consideration Its White House
Resolution 455 an energy bill
requiring a 20 percent reduction of the
emission of fossil fuels over the
next ten years It is by far the
most aggressive stride ever taken in
the fight to reverse the effects of
global warming The other piece of
legislation is the crime bill As of
today it no longer exists Im
throwing it out Im throwing it out
and writing a law that makes sense
You cannot address crime prevention
without getting rid of assault
weapons and handguns

I consider them a threat to national
security and I will go door to door
if I have to but Im gonna convince
Americans that Im right and Im
gonna get the guns Weve got

serous problems and we need serious
men and if you want to talk about
character Bob youd better come at
me with more than a burning flag and
a membership card If you want to
talk about character and American
values fine Just tell me where and
when and Ill show up This is a
time for serious men Bob and your
fifteen minutes are up My names
Andrew Shepherd and I am the
President
