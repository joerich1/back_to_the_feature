TAPAS

EXT THE DESERT - SOUTHERN SPAIN - AFTERNOON
Late summer in the year of a drought Hot dry wind DUST
everywhere

IN THE DISTANCE - a BUS appears trailing thick black smoke Stops
in the far corner of the frame A LONE PASSENGER steps off stands
in the dust of the departing bus

The BUS disappears The LONE MAN trudges across the frame

A WOMANS VOICE sounds Spanish accent MARAVILLA

MARAVILLA VOICEOVER
My father started driving me crazy five years
before I was even born

The FIGURE draws closer The windblown DUST stings his face coats
his glasses with grit

ENGLISH PHIL 20 years old Too wild hair Too white skin Too
red ears His glasses are held together by tape As is his
suitcase

He pushes his glasses up his nose blinks against the sand and
passes OUT OF FRAME --

MARAVILLAS VOICE
Of course he got off at the wrong stop

PULL UP --
to reveal the IMMENSITY AND DESOLATION OF THE DESERT

And ENGLISH PHIL a black speck moving with purpose across its
face

The sun bears down

MARAVILLAS VOICE
My father later claimed that somehow from his
home in Manchester -- the beautiful city of Manchester
in the north of England -- that somehow he had
heard there was a small but dedicated group of
scientists in the south of Spain studying how to bring
water to the desert He told anyone who would listen that
he had come to join them
LATER - THE SAME

A NIGHT SKY A CLOUD PASSES OVER THE STARS

IN THE DESERT - MIDNIGHT
ENGLISH PHIL lies asleep on a heap of brush
A DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER
MARAVILLAS VOICE
Nobody believed him of course There had
been no such scientists for ten years And the

town they had worked in was a hundred miles away

Another closer RUMBLE ENGLISH PHIL frowns and twitches in his
sleep

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING CLAP OF THUNDER And RAIN pours down on
ENGLISH PHIL Soaking him before he has time to wake and hide under
an overhanging boulder

SAME - DAWN

ENGLISH PHIL sleeps mouth open sitting up clutching his suitcase
to his chest He SNAPS abruptly awake adjusts his glasses and
without fuss resumes his purposeful trek

As he passes out of frame --

MARAVILLAS VOICE
My father was never very good on details

AT THE EDGE OF A RAVINE - DAY

ENGLISH PHIL trudges forward suitcase in one hand TORN MAP in the
other

UP AHEAD - A TWO LANE HIGHWAY

A LORRY rumbles up it ENGLISH PHIL looks at his map looks at the
highway which disappears into the badlands

AT THE HIGHWAY
ENGLISH PHIL stands thumb outstretched A CARAVAN OF DEUX CHEVAUX

CARS passes him by The bourgeois FRENCH TOURISTS within ignore
him
His EYES NARROW dangerously as he watches them go

ANOTHER CAR appears As it comes closer it is clear it is contains
two members of the GUARDIA CIVIL It PASSES the SPOT But ENGLISH

PHIL has DISAPPEARED
UNDER THE HIGHWAY BRIDGE

ENGLISH PHIL huddles hiding A HORDE of MOSQUITOS engulfs him
He swats at them swearing But sees they come from a STREAM

A MOMENT LATER - AT THE STREAM

Holding his deteriorating pointy-toed shoes in one hand he studies
the map while he bathes his blistered feet in the water Spotting
something on the map he snaps to with a decision wading out of the

stream toward a donkey track
ON THE DONKEY TRAC

ENGLISH PHIL looks at his map continues to limp forward

UP AHEAD - ON A MOUNTAIN TOP - CASTLE RUINS

ENGLISH PHIL squints at this

TIGHT CLOSE UP ON THE MAP

A tiny notation RUINED CASTLE
ENGLISH PHIL marches forward determined DUST BLOWS

MARAVILLAS VOICE
Another thing about my father He always loved
a shortcut

ENGLISH PHIL stumbles on his blistered feet His SUITCASE pops
open

A GUN falls out Looking around to make sure he is unseen
he scoops the GUN back in resticking the TAPE And travels on

MARAVILLAS VOICE
As usual what should have taken one hour took
him five

AT THE RUINED CASTLE - from its heights we can see ENGLISH PHIL
limping ever more painfully into the SMALL WHITE TOWN
MAIN STREET OF THE TOWN

A SCOOTER whines past ENGLISH PHIL up into the town CHILDREN and
DOGS play move to let the RIDER past

A DONKEY wanders across the street
A huddle of black clad OLD WOMEN gossip at the town fountain

All is animation loud shouts braying barking etc SUDDENLY ALL
GOES COMPLETELY SILENT

ENGLISH PHIL walks by Everyone human and animal STARES

Unnerved he hobbles up the street The CHILDREN and the DOGS
silently follow The DONKEY trails behind

UP AHEAD - A SIGN BAR PEPE

Ignoring his entourage ENGLISH PHIL heads for it

EXT BAR PEPE - AFTERNOON

A fly-specked grease-stained SIGN taped to the window says TAPAS
FAMOSAS And another ENGLISH SPOKE HERE

ENGLISH PHIL considers this Pushes open the door The CHILDREN
and DOGS scatter behind
INT BAR PEPE

A fly-specked grease-stained room Under a fingerprint-marked
glass counter a REVOLTING SELECTION OF OILY TAPAS

DON PEPE owner of the bar ignores ENGLISH PHIL instead polishing
a FRAMED PORTRAIT OF GENERALISSIMO FRANCISCO FRANCO

A FLOWERED CURTAIN hangs in a doorway at the end of the bar
ENGLISH PHIL clears his throat DON PEPE does not look at him

DON PEPE
jRafaela jCliente

No one appears
DON PEPE
RAFAELA

The FLOWERED CURTAIN twitches

POV - FROM BEHIND THE CURTAIN

t opens an inch to reveal ENGLISH PHIL Who puts down his
SUITCASE It of course busts open again the GUN clattering

to the floor ENGLISH PHIL dives for it shoving it back in

The CURTAIN whisks shut

N THE BAR

ENGLISH PHIL

(sits babbling nervously)
I was delighted to see your sign Sefior
as Im afraid my language skills arent
yet up to the standards of this wonderful
though impoverished country

(pause)
You havent seen any otherturistasaround
here lately

(pause)
Have you

DON PEPE turns and stares at him suspiciously ENGLISH PHIL holds

out a hand to shake DON PEPE ignores it

DON PEPE
RAFAELA

ENGLISH PHIL shrugs winces as he removes his boots
ENGLISH PHIL

I hope you dont mind my rudeness in removing
My shoesIve walked a long way and my

feet are -- well I know you understand
Everywhere in Spain Ive encountered the most
extraordinary --

A BEER is slapped down on the bar in front of him ENGLISH PHIL

looks up and is STRUCK DUMB

ENGLISH PHIL
-- warmth
MARAVILLAS VOICE
My mother

PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
RAFAELA A clear-eyed beauty
ENGLISH PHIL
(attempting to recover)which is all
the more surprising considering the REPRESSIVE
DICTATORSHIP under which you suffer
RAFAELA turns to serve up a TAPA
MARAVILLAS VOICE
She was supposed to be the most beautiful girl

for three towns Everyone said so

As ENGLISH PHIL stares at her open-mouthed RAFAELA serves him a
plate with a lone hairy chicken wing in a separated red sauce

At that moment their EYES MEET
The DOOR TO THE BAR SLAMS OPEN Startled both look up

At a drop-dead handsome young man who stands aggressively in the
doorway

MARAVILLAS VOICE
I never saw it myself

JOSE MARIA
jRafaela

RAFAELA gives a little sniff and flounces away disappearing behind
the FLOWERED CURTAIN ENGLISH PHIL looks after her forlornly

DON PEPE rushes to greet JOSE MARIA to make up for RAFAELAS
apparent rudeness

DON PEPE
Jose Maria iMi amigo

JOSE MARIA
(with respect)

Don Pepe

BEHIND THEM - ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS

Appear TWO TURISTAS A big blond German KLAUS And a shrimpy
intellectual JEAN-MICHEL They gesture frantically at ENGLISH
PHIL

He turns back to his beer and spots them Pulls on his boots and
hobbles out still holding his beer

We -- and DON PEPE and JOSE MARIA -- can see KLAUS JEAN-MICHEL
and ENGLISH PHIL argue silently as they pass around the lone beer

Finishing the beer and continuing the argument they disappear out
of frame as they go down onto the street

DON PEPE and JOSE MARIA look at each other And go to the window to
see more

MARAVILLAS VOICE
These were the Sixties and hippies were often
unfairly thought of as criminals by the mean-
spirited locals

INT RAFAELAS HIDEOUT - ABOVE THE BAR PEPE

RAFAELA twitches back a FLOWERED CURTAIN at the window She watches
as the THREE MEN walk down the road still arguing Behind her can
be seen the decoration of her private space Pinned to the walls
are MAGAZINE PICTURES of FAROFF PLACES Of THE BEATLES Of CHE
GUEVARA

MARAVILLAS VOICE
Of course in this case they were right

EXT TOWN STREET

ENGLISH PHIL
Look I got lost okay Im here now arent I
As anarchists I think we shouldnt get too hung
up on this bourgeois time thing

KLAUS
All Im saying is that if you want to rob a bank
for the benefit of the Revolution you have to
maintain a certain discipline

JEAN-MICHEL
(worriedly)
But Klaus isnt discipline fascistic (CONT )
JEAN-MICHEL

(CONT )
I ask this because in theory weve agreed
not to take on the qualities of those who
oppress us because in doing so

ENGLISH PHIL
The bullion truck gets here at five oclock
Weve plenty of time

KLAUS
SSHHH

DON PEPE and JOSE MARIA walk by looking at the three men with
suspicion

JOSE MARIA
(in SPANISH subtitled)
What crime are those damn hippies planning

DON PEPE and JOSE MARIA greet two members of the GUARDIA CIVIL

All four converse in low tones staring at the three men who try
to look unconcerned KLAUS strikes a match against a streetsign
that says this is the PASEO DEL GENERALISSIMO Lights a cigarette

DON PEPE JOSE MARIA and the GUARDIA CIVIL back track to the bar
still watching the THREE MEN warily

KLAUS
(mutters)
Bastards

ENGLISH PHIL
Dont worry Klaus This evening we will
liberate their payroll -- the payroll of
Francos hated Guardia Civil not only making
a powerful symbolic gesture against the forces
of imperialism but also providing funds for
certain hand-picked leftist charities

CAMERA DROPS to a LOW HEROIC ANGLE on the THREE MEN

KLAUS
(searching his pockets)
Anyone got any money I could use another beer

JEAN-MICHEL
And of course we will do all this in the spirit
of nonviolence
ENGLISH PHIL
Of course Were agreed were utterly
against violence

(to KLAUS)
No Ive run out This countrys more
expensive than I thought it was going to be

KLAUS
(darkly)
Death to Franco
ENGLISH PHIL and JEAN-MICHEL
(nodding agreement)
Death to fascism

They all PASS OUT OF FRAME

KLAUSS VOICE
What about you Jean-Michel

JEAN-MICHELS VOICE
We spent it all on cigarettes remember

ON THE PLAZA IN FRONT OF THE BAR PEPE

JOSE MARIA DON PEPE and the TWO POLICEMEN confer in low voices
Above them in the window RAFAELA listens

DOWN THE STREET

ENGLISH PHIL gives one last look back at the BAR PEPE before he and
his friends disappear again around a corner

He looks at his watch also A DARK-HAIRED GIRL passes by and he
looks up for a moment hopeful But its not RAFAELA He frowns

THE MUSIC INTENSIFIES

JEAN-MICHEL rises The THREE REVOLUTIONARIES converge

CRANE UP to reveal JOSE MARIA the GUARDIA CIVIL DON PEPE and the

behind him hurrying after carrying a WICKER BASKET FULL OF
SHOPPING

RAFAELA
(hisses)
iSssssstttt

ENGLISH PHIL intent on his task doesnt hear

RAFAELA
(whispers)
jOye Companero

Startled ENGLISH PHIL turns and TRIPS AS HIS SHOES FINALLY COME
APART

He looks down as RAFAELA comes up and grabs his arm She follows
his look and GASPS His socks worn to tatters reveal a BLOODY
MESS OF BLISTERS
RAFAELA

ENGLISH PHIL

trouble but when youre focussed on business

RAFAELA hangs onto ENGLISH PHILS ARM

RAFAELA
Put your gun in my basket

ENGLISH PHIL
WHAT I mean what gun What are you

RAFAELA
Jose Maria and my father think youre trying to rob
the bank Theyre up on the roof with shotguns
(meaningfully)
But youre NOT robbers ARE you

The SOUND of a SHOTGUN being pumped ENGLISH PHIL looks up at the
roof

ANGLE ON JEAN-MICHEL and KLAUS - staring at ENGLISH PHIL who STARES
up at the roof

The GUARDS go to unlock the BULLION TRUCK
JEAN-MICHEL and KLAUS gesture furiously at ENGLISH PHIL --
ENGLISH PHIL

He gestures at JEAN-MICHEL and KLAUS points at the ROOF

RAFAELA

ENGLISH PHIL
No yes thats right A mistake

He signals to his PARTNERS running his forefinger back and forth
across his throat

JEAN-MICHEL

KLAUS
Why is he pointing at the roof

BOTH MEN LOOK UP They see the PRIEST with his SHOTGUN
The PRIEST vanishes

They look to the side of the PLAZA The OLD MEN in GREY SWEATERS
begin to walk toward them

A BUS arrives at the far side of the PLAZA

AT ENGLISH PHIL AND RAFAELA - as a MEMBER OF THE GUARDIA CIVIL
heads toward them

RAFAELA

RAFAELA

She hurries away ENGLISH PHIL looks back MEMBERS OF THE GUARDIA

runs after RAFAELA Seeing him go KLAUS heads for a FRUIT DELIVERY
TRUCK left idling on the square commandeers and drives off in it
knocking over a STACK OF EMPTY CRATES as he goes JEAN-MICHEL
turns tail and jumps onto the BUS

MARAVILLAS VOICE
My fathers French friend never returned The
German remained in the vicinity Over the years
he continued to cause problems for my family and
our town

ANGLE ON THE BULLION TRUCK

Leaving town the way it came slowing to let ENGLISH PHIL apparently
chase RAFAELA across the street toward the BAR PEPE She appears to
be angry but with her hand motions him on

MARAVILLAS VOICE
As you can see for everything that happened
my mother had only herself to blame

INT UPSTAIRS STOREROOM - RAFAELAS HIDEOUT - BAR PEPE â DAY

OUT THE WINDOW - on the TERRACE below JOSE MARIA appears with the
PRIEST They look disappointed

ENGLISH PHIL

She gives an EXCLAMATION OF ANNOYANCE as she drops the items she
carries and has to gather them up again
JOSE MARIA and the PRIEST look up at the window

The SUITCASE explodes again But this time as ENGLISH PHIL
swears gathering his belongings back up there is NO GUN

the door
EXT GARBAGE DUMP - DAWN

ENGLISH PHIL sleeps on a discarded sofa He wakes to a scrabbling
sound

Sits up RAFAELA climbs on the garbage heap searching intently
After a moment she digs And holds up ENGLISH PHILS GUN She
sees hes awake and ducks her head shyly

THE SOUND OF SPANISH SQUAWKING THROUGH A BULLHORN

Startled RAFAELA drops the GUN It SLIPS down under a PILE OF
ROTTEN FISH

The TWO GUARDIA CIVIL drive up the ravine in a PICK-UP blasting
RAFAELA and ENGLISH PHIL with the BULLHORN RAFAELA gives up on
the GUN and goes to meet them

As ENGLISH PHIL watches she gestures wildly scolding the TWO
POLICEMEN They look back at her sulky And drive away

He climbs onto the refuse pile digging at the smelly pile
RAFAELAS VOICE

He looks at her astonished and KISSES her AGAIN She KISSES HIM
MORE FERVENTLY BACK

They look at each other And holding hands turn and hurry away
AT JOSE MARIA DON PEPE AND THE GUARDIA CIVIL

Watching as RAFAELA and ENGLISH PHIL scramble away

ENGLISH PHILS STORY
As MARAVILLA talks we see ENGLISH PHILS VERSION of the tale
Three MEN IN BLACK MASKS overtake a MERCEDES and KIDNAP the RICH
FAT CAT INSIDE

MARAVILLAS VOICE
He claimed to have kidnapped some rich American
industrialist who was about to rape the English
countryside

IN A SHACK - One of the MASKED MEN is revealed to be A HEROIC
ENGLISH PHIL

FLASH FORWARD

He offers the FAT CAT his own food to eat The FAT CAT looks at him
admiringly

ENGLISH PHIL holds forth reading to the FAT CAT from KARL MARX as
the FAT CAT eats

MARAVILLAS VOICE
He says there had been no request for ransom
His and his friends goal had been the
reeducation of the man When this was achieved they let him
go

The FAT CAT tears in his eyes embraces all of the MEN He
reserves his warmest embrace for ENGLISH PHIL

MARAVILLAS VOICE
The industrialist promised to mend his ways

The FAT CAT scampers off as the MEN watch proudly He disappears
over a hill

After a moment the HILL IS SWARMING WITH COPS
The GANG scatters ENGLISH PHIL running hard
MARAVILLAS VOICE
Never trust a rich industrialist my father said
PRESENT DAY - AT RAFAELA AND ENGLISH PHIL

INT RAFAELAS ROOM
RAFAELA and ENGLISH PHIL enthusiastically make love
ENGLISH PHIL

His FRIENDS egg him on

ON THE STREET TO THE BAR PUENTE

ENGLISH PHIL once again carrying the shopping walks down the
street with RAFAELA

ENGLISH PHIL
Cattle ranching is nothing but a wastage of resources
But you can use every part of an ostrich And it
doesnt strip the land The ostrich is a low maintenance
high yield bird

She nods The OLD MEN IN GREY SWEATERS stare at them
DON PEPE pushed forward by his friends blocks ENGLISH PHILS PATH

DON PEPE
(reads)

ENGLISH PHIL and RAFAELA stop ENGLISH PHIL looks puzzled Then he
sees the SPANISH-ENGLISH DICTIONARY

ENGLISH PHIL

He takes the DICTIONARY from DON PEPE who helpfully points out the
word
ENGLISH PHIL
Malcriado Well There you are Theres no
literal translation of the word Its likelaggard

We could bring in an airport Turn the town into
an internationally famous tourist center Like Stratford
