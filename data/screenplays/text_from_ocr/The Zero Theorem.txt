The Zero Theorem

by
Pat Rushin
FADE IN

A rim of swirling light appears circling helplessly into a
gigantic BLACK HOLE It spirals inward

A phone RINGS

INT RUN-DOWN CHAPEL - NIGHT

Dim high-ceilinged Gutted of half its pews Broken
stained glass windows Vandalized statues of saints
Iconoclastic clutter lies beneath rusted wrought iron stands
of votive candles

At the chapels front a decapitated Jesus hangs from a
charred wooden cross above where an altar once stood

The altar space converted to a computer work station Piles
of carelessly stashed discs and printouts abound

Sacristy doorways lead to kitchen and bathroom An unmade
brass bed sits off to one side

In an alcove off to the other side a SHRINE Candles burn
in a votive stand Framed pictures hang above it their
faces turned to the wall

A tormented FIGURE sits at the computer

Meet QOHEN LETH 40s gaunt pale and completely hairless

His hands clench and unclench above his keyboard as he stares
mesmerized at the swirling image of a BLACK HOLE SCREENSAVER

His rotary phone RINGS

Qohen blinks out of his trance a look of panic on his face
and reaches for the phone too late

The phone stops ringing before he can answer it

Qohen MOANS softly and turns back to his computer He taps a
key and the screensaver disappears replaced by a scrolling
flurry of esoteric symbols

He types frenetically eyes focused intensely

The phone RINGS Qohen snatches the receiver

QOHEN
Hello Hello

No answer

Qohen SIGHS slowly hangs up the receiver and returns his
attention to the computer screen He begins typing again
His wind-up clock RINGS Its hands read 509

Qohen jumps He slaps the alarm off rubs his eyes as if
hes just awakened Standing and stretching he raises his
eyes to the disfigured crucifix before him

INT KITCHEN - LATER

Qohen stands in his small galley kitchen waiting for the
microwave to finish an open container of generic INSTANT
OATMEAL on the counter in front of him

An open cupboard above reveals various food products all
bland all tasteless all generically packaged in white with
block black lettering

Qohen methodically sets the counter with plate napkin
spoon and after retrieving the spoon from its drawer
notices a steak knife

He picks it up studies its edge then gently traces a
forearm vein like an architect drawing a blueprint

The knife draws blood
Qohen stares at it
The microwave BEEPS
The wall phone RINGS

Qohen looks confused for a moment Then frantic and
hopeful he lunges for the phone

QOHEN
Hello

He listens face turning bland
QOHEN (CONTD)

No Were sorry Were afraid you

have the wrong number
Qohen hangs up takes his steaming bowl of oatmeal from the
microwave He stands at the counter spoon in hand staring
at the bowl with slight distaste just another job to do
He absently brings his wrist to his mouth tastes the blood

His face sours

He grabs his napkin and wipes his tongue clean
INT BATHROOM - LATER

Qohen stares at himself in the mirror as he brushes his
teeth He spits takes a deep breath

INT CHAPEL - LATER

Clad in black sleeves and collar buttoned Qohen pops a disc
out of his computer and slips it into his shirt pocket

SHRINE - MOMENTS LATER

Qohen lights a candle He stares at one of the picture
frames then carefully turns it to reveal its hidden photo

INSERT - PHOTO

Standing on the front porch of a suburban home Qohens WIFE
holds their baby SON in her arms both smiling at the camera
She holds the babys hand up in a pudgy-fingered wave
Standing behind the two YOUNG QOHEN beams with pride

BACK TO SCENE

Qohen gazes at the photo then bows his head fighting his
emotion He turns the pictures face to the wall again

He walks down the long aisle to the chapel door opens it
INT DILAPIDATED VESTIBULE - MOMENTS LATER

Qohen approaches a great oak door He hesitates as he
touches the doorknob bracing himself then opens it

-to a blast of light and STREET NOISES
EXT INNER-CITY STREET - MORNING

Qohen exits Colorful graffiti mars words etched in stone
above the door THE BROTHERHOOD OF THE INEFFABLE NAME

He hurries past caged storefronts eyes downcast

Near his bus stop Qohen sees a GIRL 10 sitting on the curb
beside a toppled bicycle She holds a skinned knee CRYING

Qohen hesitates looks around No one else is there to help
He approaches the Girl cautiously

QOHEN
We hate to impose ourselves but may
we assist you in any way
The Girl covers her face with her hands still CRYING

Qohen stares at her helplessly then moves to her bike
A bent fender scrapes the front wheel when he tests it He
tries to pry the fender back into shape

The Girl drops her hands from her face

GIRL
Leave my bike alone Leave it alone

A SIREN sounds close by and a helmeted MOTORCYCLE COP skids
up to the curb engine ROARING He turns off the siren
dismounts slowly approaches Qohen and the girl

MOTORCYCLE COP
Please step back from the child sir

QOHEN
We were simply attempting to --

MOTORCYCLE COP
Put down the bike and step back

Qohen gently lays down the bicycle
His bus passes and he hastens to his stop

The bus door opens Qohen looks at the Motorcycle Cop
comforting the crying Girl His face tightens

INT CITY BUS - MOMENTS LATER

Qohen sits alone in the rear seat The bus jumps and
jostles Qohen shuts his eyes hands folded as if in prayer
TRAFFIC NOISES BLARE in a crescendo of anxiety

INT QOHENS WORK CUBICLE - AFTERNOON

Neat and orderly No sign of personal belongings

One poster adorns the wall a mans torso in a sharply-
tailored taupe suit Bold letters proclaim MANAGEMENT
Smaller script reads Everythings Under Control

A video camera (labeled MANCAM) records Qohens every move

Except Qohen doesnt move He simply sits staring at his
computer monitor trancelike

The image on the monitor shows Qohen from behind staring at
an image of himself on his monitor staring at an image of
himself ad infinitum

His phone RINGS

Qohen slowly comes back to reality as the phone continues
RINGING Finally he picks up the receiver
A female COMPUTERIZED VOICE speaks

COMPUTERIZED VOICE (VO)
Hello -- Qohen Leth -- Corporate Health
Maintenance has approved review of your
disability request for today at 1440
Please be prompt

QOHEN
We are nothing if not prompt

Qohen hangs up glances at his watch He touches his
keyboard the image of himself shrinks to the screens upper
corner replaced by a column of flashing signs cryptic

symbols formulae and numerals

Qohen frowns and with some effort begins typing

MR JOBY 20s appears in the cubicles doorway scratching

an elusive itch inside his ill-fitting suit coat
soft manic-looking man with shaggy hair and beard

JOBY
Hows it hanging Quinn

QOHEN
(without looking up)
Its Qohen Mr Joby and as weve told
you before it isnt hanging at all well
Were dying

JOBY
Again Better see the medics about that

QOHEN
We have an appointment this afternoon

JOBY
Not this afternoon Quinn

QOHEN
You approved it

JOBY
Cancel it You got that Transfinite
Quantum Paradox Project due today

QOHEN
We attached it to you yesterday

JOBY
Good work But you still have that
Whatchacallit Project due next week

QOHEN
The Neural Synaptic Intervention
Project Also finished

(MORE )
QOHEN (CONTD)
Tautologics Division is running the
standard redundancies

JOBY
Whoa You did all that this morning

QOHEN

We did it all at home last night As
weve told you repeatedly we find our
work environment distressing The
people the lighting the noise the
interruptions the the people

(taking a deep breath)
Considering our at-home output we cant
begin to imagine why you insist on our
coming here each day

Joby removes his suit coat and reaches over his shoulder to
pursue a particularly shy itch

JOBY
Thats a Management decision Quinn

QOHEN
Qohen Q--no U--O-H-E-N

JOBY
Out of my hands

QOHEN
Perhaps we should talk to Management

Joby stifles a guffaw then casually drapes his suit coat
over the ManCam

JOBY
(voice lowered)
Nobody talks to Management Quinn No
way no how nuh-uh nyetskis Take my
advice Knock off the bitching and
moaning Its not all that bad here

QOHEN
Its worse than you can imagine
Mr Joby but we could suffer the wear
and tear on our nerves if only we werent
afraid of missing our call

JOBY
Your call

QOHEN
Yes our call Weve mentioned it a
number of times

JOBY
Aint ringing a bell
QOHEN
Were expecting a certain phone call a
call weve been waiting for all our
lives a call that will give our lives
purpose and meaning and each minute we
spend here we fear we may be missing it

JOBY
Oh Right That call Um How about
letting your machine take it Or get
call forwarding I guess I could bend
the rules on personal calls in your case

QOHEN
We have to be home to receive it

Joby shakes his head stumped He moves behind Qohen
massages his shoulders

JOBY
I feel for you Quinn but theres
nothing I can do

QOHEN
(stiffening)
We prefer not to be touched

Joby stops steps back

QOHEN (CONTD)

Weve been extremely patient Mr Joby
but were afraid we must now issue an
ultimatum Either you let us work at
home or we will be forced to resign

JOBY
You cant quit Quinn Youre the best
cruncher I got
Qohen turns back to his computer and resumes typing
QOHEN
If our meeting with Health Maintenance is
successful the issue will be settled
If not you leave us no choice

JOBY
Youre killing me Be reasonable

Qohen ignores him
Joby grabs his coat and turns to leave frustrated

JOBY (CONTD)
Ill see what I can do Quinn

INT HEALTH MAINTENANCE BOARD - DAY

Three doctors sit at one end of a long table grayish light
from an overcast day sifting through the window behind them

At the head sits DOCTOR 1 a prim woman in a drab business
suit She polishes her bifocals with a tissue

To her right sits DOCTOR 2 a middle-aged man in hospital
scrubs that reveal a NicoDerm patch on his upper arm He
chews a wad of Nicorette gum while perusing Qohens file

DOCTOR 3 slouches to Doctor 1s left A handsome young man
in a white lab coat stethoscope draped around his neck he
gazes out the window with the soulful look of a bored poet
Qohen sits stone-faced at the far end of the table

Doctor 1 puts on her glasses to appraise him

DOCTOR 1
And this is

Doctor 2 nervously clicks his pen chomping on his gum

DOCTOR 2
Qohen Leth Ontological Research
Division requesting Disability Leave

QOHEN
Or reassignment to work at home

DOCTOR 1
Thats a Management decision Mr Leth
We only deal with health issues here
What seems to be the problem

QOHEN
Were dying

DOCTOR 3
Whos we

QOHEN
Us Ourselves

DOCTOR 3
But theres only the one of you

QOHEN
So it would appear

Doctor 3 SNIFFS returns to gazing out the window
DOCTOR 2
(consulting file)
Subjects had five physicals in the last
year Hes healthy as a horse

Doctor 1 takes the file from him scanning it

DOCTOR 1
What makes you think youre dying

QOHEN
We can feel it Deep inside us

DOCTOR 2
Hearts strong as an ox
(a frustrated puff on pen)
BP and cholesterol I could only dream of

QOHEN
Our hair has fallen out

DOCTOR 3
Idiopathic

DOCTOR 2
Perfectly harmless The tests dont lie

QOHEN
Then the tests are merely mistaken

DOCTOR 1
According to your file youre the most
productive number cruncher in your --

QOHEN
Entity cruncher Our data is much more
complex than mere numbers

DOCTOR 1
Dying people are rarely so productive
QOHEN
Nevertheless were dying
DOCTOR 2
No youre not
QOHEN
Yes we are
DOCTOR 2

No youre not

QOHEN
Yes we are
Doctor 2 grabs the Nicorette pack savagely rips loose a
piece of gum and shoves it in his mouth

Doctor 3 supremely bored now uses his stethoscope to
listen to his own heartbeat

QOHEN (CONTD)
Perhaps we should get another opinion

DOCTOR 3
Oh let me do this one Please

Doctor 1 nods Doctor 3 sits up clears his throat

DOCTOR 3 (CONTD)

From the moment were born we all begin
to die Sooner or later beggar or king
death comes to all

DOCTOR 1
That will do Doctor

DOCTOR 3
But its true

DOCTOR 2
Whered you get your degree

DOCTOR 1
Disability request denied Its back to
work for you Mr Leth

Qohen rises to leave defeated Doctor 1 takes off her
glasses studying him

DOCTOR 1 (CONTD)
This board must also recommend that you
seek psychiatric evaluation

Doctor 2 waves a CD-ROM

DOCTOR 2
I saw this coming a mile away

QOHEN
Weve seen psychiatrists in the past
Its proven to be a waste of our time
We must stay home to wait for our call

DOCTOR 2
Youll have time for this one

He slides the CD-ROM down the table Qohen picks it up
cover reads DR SHRINK-ROM INTERACTIVE PSYCHIATRIST

INT QOHENS WORK CUBICLE - LATER
Joby stands in Qohens doorway arms folded

JOBY
Didnt figure the medics would help but
Jobys here I can get Management to see
you Hell be at my party tonight

QOHEN

JOBY
(sheepishly)

Guess you missed your invitation Whole
office is coming including Management
himself Just show up I1l take care
of the rest

QOHEN
Were afraid we cant

JOBY
What gotta stay home and shampoo

Joby playfully musses Qohens hairless head but seeing his
frigid expression quickly stops

QOHEN
We fear parties We especially fear
living rooms at parties We never know
quite where to stand
Joby stares then suddenly LAUGHS slapping him on the back

JOBY
You kill me Quinn See you tonight

Joby leaves Qohen takes a deep breath to calm himself

QOHEN
Its Qohen

INT JOBYS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Qohen uncomfortably plods his way through a room crowded with
CO-WORKERS He is lost amid the LAUGHTER AND CONVERSATION

He passes a couple of CO-WORKERS who eye him derisively

CO-WORKER 1
Whos the geeky goth

CO-WORKER 2
Cube zombie Some kind of Einstein

Qohen bumps into BAINSLEY 20s wearing a loudly-patterned
dress her buxom figure seems to be bursting out of

Qohen steps to his right just as Bainsley steps to her left
She steps to her left just as Qohen shifts to his right

Bainsley GIGGLES still blocking his way
BAINSLEY
I love the look Fifty-first century
human the final evolutionary product
Maximum brain minimalist body
Qohen stares at her then clumsily makes his way past her

Qohen finds Joby obviously tipsy laughing with a crowd

JOBY
Party boy You made it

QOHEN
Is Management here

The group looks at Qohen strangely Joby LAUGHS
uncomfortably takes Qohens arm and moves him away

JOBY
(whispering)
You wanna start a rumor riot

QOHEN
Where is Management

JOBY
Probably on his way Soon as I spot him
Ill let you know Meantime

Joby slaps Qohen on the back Qohen flinches
JOBY (CONTD)
(loudly)
Lighten up have a little fun for a
change Mingle Quinn mingle

QOHEN
Its Qohen

JOBY
Of course it is

Joby gives Qohen a push on his way

As Qohen looks for a place to retreat from the party crush
NOISES FADE He enters a quiet corner of the room

DIMLY-LIT CORNER

Two wing-back chairs flank a table with a reading lamp

In the furthest chair sits MANAGEMENT dressed in the same
taupe suit featured in the poster in Qohens office a suit
that chameleon-like matches the color of the chair He
blends in so well that at first Qohen doesnt even see him
But when he does Qohen stops takes a step back

Management holds a book at eye level With his other hand
he balances a teacup and saucer on his knee Apparently
engrossed in his reading Management lifts the teacup takes
a delicate sip and returns the cup carefully to its saucer
Qohen quietly turns to leave

MANAGEMENT
I take it youre not happy Mr Leth

Qohen hesitates startled

QOHEN
Do we know you

Still not looking at Qohen Management turns a page

MANAGEMENT
I know you Mr Leth Sit

Qohen grimaces in the direction of the party then nervously
perches on the edge of the empty chair

Management sips from his teacup eyes riveted on the page

MANAGEMENT (CONTD)
What seems to be the problem

QOHEN
We We simply want to go home

Qohen notices Managements bland disinterest

QOHEN (CONTD)
We could easily double our output there

Management turns another page
Qohen drums his fingers on his knees
QOHEN (CONTD)
Our chief concern is that we might miss

our call You see we have been waiting
for a certain call all our lives now

Management stops reading slowly looks up from his book

Management studies Qohen for a moment then blinks and

QOHEN (CONTD)
and although the nature and origin of
our call remain quintessentially a
mystery to us we cant help but hope it
will provide us with a purpose weve long
lived without

returns his attention to his book

Qohen stands cowed by Managements bland disinterest

MANAGEMENT
Youre quite insane Mr Leth

QOHEN
Were sorry to have disturbed you

He turns and flees to the

Suddenly a drunken Joby snags Qohen

JOBY

QOHEN

JOBY

QOHEN

People nearby overhear and turn to stare quizzically
makes a show of LAUGHING skeptically

JOBY
Better watch the cocktails Quinn
(pulling him aside whispering)
Are you crazy Management parties
incognito

QOHEN
This isnt working Mr Joby

JOBY
No shit Youre blowing his cover

of hors doeuvres stuffing her

Joby

QOHEN
Were afraid we must go now

JOBY
Wait Ill get you a meeting with him

Joby steers Qohen to the buffet table

JOBY (CONTD)
Youre not leaving without eating Quinn

QOHEN
Its Qohen Weve apparently had our
meeting And our diet dictates against
all foods with perceptible flavor

JOBY
Eat Thats an order

Qohen surveys the food tray grimly He SIGHS selects an
olive and tucks it into his mouth frowning

JOBY (CONTD)
(loudly)
Plenty of eats
Joby slaps Qohen on the back
Qohen GULPS lodging the olive deep in his throat

JOBY (CONTD)
Plenty more Plenty for everybody

Joby moves off drunkenly glad-handing other guests
Qohen stumbles away struggling for breath
HALLWAY

Away from the crowd Qohen falls against the wall panic-
stricken He pounds his chest trying to free the olive

He lurches to an open doorway

STUDY

As if by magic Management sits behind a mahogany desk
reading his book and sipping his tea His eyes move from the

book to Qohen with an expression of mild amusement

MANAGEMENT
What is the meaning of life Mr Leth

Qohen clutches his throat eyes bulging

MANAGEMENT (CONTD)
So close to its end and still no answer

Management closes his book
MANAGEMENT (CONTD)
I have a special project for you that
might prove to be mutually beneficial
The room blurs
MANAGEMENT (CONTD)
But theres not much time Mr Leth Not
much time at all

Qohens knees buckle

And then he is suddenly lifted off his feet from behind and
dragged back into the

HALLWAY

Bainsley performs the Heimlich maneuver on Qohen She loses
her balance stumbles down the narrow corridor with him She
hangs on fiercely heaving him off his feet again and again
The olive SHOOTS from his mouth ricochets off the wall and
rolls to a stop by the baseboard Instantly a scruffy rodent
appears grabs the olive and disappears back into the wall
Bainsley releases her hold Qohen gasps for breath

BAINSLEY
I thought I smelled trouble

The neckline of Bainsleys dress is tugged low She blithely
plumps her breasts while rearranging her clothing

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Everybody hates to make a scene but the
worst thing you can do is go off by
yourself Embarrassments the number one
cause of choking deaths

Qohen stares into her eyes speechless He suddenly beelines
for the bathroom Closes the door Locks it

BATHROOM

Qohen splashes water on his face He stares at himself in
the mirror He reaches to touch his reflection then
staggers backward with a look of pain

He sits on the toilet seat face buried in his hands

A loud KNOCK at the door Qohen jumps to his feet startled

BAINSLEY (V0O)
Still alive in there

Qohen quickly dries his face and opens the door Bainsley
squeezes past him hands him her wine glass

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Hold this

She heads for the toilet hiking her dress to the top of her
thighs Qohen stares Bainsley smiles

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Care to join me

QOHEN
Excuse us

BAINSLEY
(winking)
Close the door I wont be long
HALLWAY

Qohen closes the door and stands uncomfortably wine in hand
He sniffs it distastefully then eases to the study

STUDY

Qohen scans the room puzzled Management is gone
HALLWAY

Qohen stands obediently outside the bathroom door
The toilet FLUSHES The faucet RUNS

The door opens Bainsley exits smoothing her dress She
flashes Qohen a sexy smile takes the wine glass from him

BAINSLEY
So I saved your life No big deal

QOHEN
Forgive our ambivalence Thank you

BAINSLEY
You owe me Im Bainsley

She takes his hand in hers looks him up and down

BAINSLEY (CONTD)

She tugs at her dress as if uncomfortable with its fit

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Youre staring at me You think my dress

QOHEN
We -- we really should be going --

BAINSLEY
Its my daddys fault He used to buy me
these incredibly ugly clothes to keep the
boys away Didnt work Only made me
want to get naked and thats no way to
keep the boys away So I never developed
a fashion sense Are you on drugs

QOHEN
No

BAINSLEY
Have you tried them

QOHEN
We have tried many pharmaceuticals both
therapeutic and recreational but weve
discovered none with sufficient potency
to treat our essential condition

BAINSLEY
I hear you You should try natural
herbs Im happy with the herbs Way
happy They should put St Johns Wort
in the drinking water like fluoride

She leans close and rests an elbow on his shoulder

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
--Are you here alone

QOHEN
We are generally everywhere alone

BAINSLEY
The we thing royal or plural

QOHEN

She trails her fingernails over the skin of his scalp
BAINSLEY
Love it Youre the enigmatic workaholic

BAINSLEY

Her lips move close to his Qohen pulls back flustered

QOHEN
We cant imagine your interest in us

BAINSLEY
I saved your life Thats a turn-on

QOHEN
We really must be leaving

Bainsley touches a finger to his lips

BAINSLEY
Seriously We could have some fun

She caresses his chest pulls a felt-tip pen from his pocket
and scrawls her name and number on the palm of his hand

BAINSLEY (CONTD)

Qohen stares at his hand

Young Qohen is buried in the sand up to his neck

His Wife tamps the sand down LAUGHING while his Son

Joby pulls Qohen past Bob turning another corner

JOBY
Bob calls everybody Bob Says its a
waste of brain cells remembering names

QOHEN

They reach a row of file cabinets Joby opens a drawer

JOBY (CONTD)

Joby gives him more disks Overwhelmed Qohen struggles to
keep from dropping them Joby reaches into the drawer again

JOBY (CONTD)

wanted Everythings under control

Joby holds up the last disk stares through its hole

JOBY (CONTD)

Your wife and son were a source of joy
Werent they Qohen

Qohens eyes cloud

DR SHRINK-ROM (CONTD)
Why dont you ever talk about them

QOHEN
What good is joy when it doesnt last
We havent felt joy in years

DR SHRINK-ROM
Tell me what youre feeling Qohen

QOHEN
We feel nothing

DR SHRINK-ROM
Youre a tough nut to crack Qohen and
of course I dont mean nut in the
pejorative sense Perhaps youd like
to start over Lets return to --

The phone RINGS interrupting Qohen looks at it with a
mixture of hope and despair He picks it up

QOHEN
Hello

COMPUTERIZED VOICE (VO)
Hello Qohen Leth Your next
installment of data is due for upload in
one hour If the target timetable is
attainable press one If not --

Qohen presses 2 interrupting the voice
COMPUTERIZED VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
Please enter estimated number of minutes
needed for target overrun
Qohen hesitates considering then presses 1-2-0
COMPUTERIZED VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
A moment please ManCom will allow 70
minutes Goodbye Qohen Leth

QOHEN
Thats not enough time
The line has gone dead Qohen hangs up

DR SHRINK-ROM
Perhaps you should get back to work

QOHEN
What difference does it make Well

before weve finished with the old ones
Weve never worked with data like this
It refuses to stay crunched

DR SHRINK-ROM
Deep breaths Qohen deep breaths

Qohen stares up at the crucifix ManCams red light shines

QOHEN
All we want is our call

DR SHRINK-ROM
Yes Your call Lets continue our
discussion next session I find your
feelings fascinating and look forward --
Qohen clicks on exit and Dr Shrink-ROM vanishes

He types a command and a menu bar reads ZERO THEOREM
PROJECT A stream of signs and symbols scroll

With a pained expression he goes to work
INT CHAPEL - NIGHT

Qohen at his computer feverishly typing A STORM rages
outside and his driven eyes are lit by LIGHTNING FLASHES

He stops typing freezing the scrolling signs and symbols

QOHEN
This cant be right

Qohen types a command and the entities begin scrolling in
reverse He slows the stream of symbols stops

QOHEN (CONTD)
Nothing adds up

He resumes his typing the symbols scrolling faster and
faster as he works himself into a frenzied pace

Suddenly LIGHTNING FLASHES and the PHONE RINGS

With a cry of pain Qohen snatches up the receiver

QOHEN (CONTD)
Hello Hello

COMPUTERIZED VOICE (VO)
Qohen Leth Data is overdue for upload
Please enter estimated number of minutes
needed for target overrun

Qohen savagely punches numbers

COMPUTERIZED VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
That time frame is not authorized
Please enter estimated number

Qohen drops the phone The message repeats itself Symbols
scroll in a dizzying blur

Qohen stares at the monitor in despair
Then his eyes narrow in anger
He opens a file drawer rummages through it wildly and pulls
out a ball-peen hammer He looks at it eyes full of doubt
He hesitates a moment then -- decided -- lifts it high
Dr Shrink-ROM suddenly pops up on the monitor
DR SHRINK-ROM

Deep breaths Qohen Perhaps a mild

sedative is in order I can arrange --
Qohen SMASHES the monitor shorting out Dr Shrink-ROM
The storm looses a LIGHTNING BOLT
Qohen turns the hammer to the phone SMASH

Qohen looks around wildly His gaze moves to the shrine and
lingers a moment He lifts his eyes to the crucifix ManCam

He raises the hammer A look of despair crosses his face

All is quiet except the distant RUMBLE of thunder and the
soft PATTER of rain on the roof The storm has passed

Qohen lets the hammer drop to the floor
INT CHAPEL - DAY
Qohen lies on his bed his expression blank

The intercom BUZZES repeatedly Qohen slowly rises walks to
the door and presses the intercom

QOHEN
Yes

MANS VOICE (VO)
Phoneman Management says you got a
problem Let me in buddy

Qohen buzzes the street door open
MOMENTS LATER

QOHEN opens his door to a white jump-suited Joby who wheels
in a hefty duffel bag and throws an arm around Qohen

JOBY
Quinn Long time no hug

Qohen goes rigid awkwardly backs away

JOBY (CONTD)
Still dying I see

QOHEN
What are you doing here

JOBY
Field work I love it Gets me out of
the office and into a snappy uniform

Qohen follows Joby to the work station CHUCKLING Joby
genuflects before the crucifix He rises looks around

JOBY (CONTD)
You could use a womans touch Quinn

Qohen closes his eyes jaw clenched

JOBY (CONTD)
ManCom cant reach you Whats up

QOHEN
At present we are having difficulty
maintaining our upload schedule Our
entities are acting strangely

Joby pokes at the broken monitor eyebrows raised
JOBY

Personnel meltdown Seen plenty of it

Me Id yank you and go to the bullpen

Joby glances at the shattered phone then picks up the ball-
peen hammer from the floor shakes his head

JOBY (CONTD)
But Managements giving you another
chance Dont ask me why

Qohen takes the hammer from him puts it in a file drawer
Joby shrugs pulls a new phone from his duffel bag

JOBY (CONTD)
Its all about connections Quinn Wires
and wireless weaving a world wide web
Cant do anything if youre disconnected

He plugs in the phone then pulls a new monitor from his
duffel bag He wipes imaginary sweat from his brow

JOBY (CONTD)
Whoa Manual labor makes me parched
Got a spare beer for a working man

QOHEN
We have tap water

JOBY
Yum

INT KITCHEN - LATER
Joby guzzles a tepid glass of water BURPS

JOBY
Ive missed you Quinn A supervisor
doesnt make many friends you know

QOHEN
You consider us a friend

JOBY
Sure do
(conspiratorially)
So tell me whats the real problem

QOHEN
The Zero Theorem is unprovable Were
dying We havent received our call

JOBY
(nodding)
You dont trust Management

QOHEN
Nothing adds up

JOBY
Or maybe everything adds up to nothing

QOHEN
What do you mean

Joby slaps Qohen on the back making him jump

JOBY
Poor bastard All stressed out I
know someone in the decompression
business who might be able to help
Might even help you get that call of
yours Who knows Let me see what I
can do Quinn

QOHEN
Its Qohen Q--no U--O-H --

JOBY
No need to spell it out Jobys here

THE BLACK HOLE
Light swirls violently around the inky blackness
INT CHAPEL - NIGHT

Qohen sits up in bed struggling to orient himself
computers glow illuminates his face He tilts his

There is a distant BUZZ
INT CHAPEL - DOOR - DAY
Qohen presses the intercom

QOHEN
Yes

WOMANS VOICE (VO)
Troubleshooter Buzz me in babe

MOMENTS LATER

The
head

Qohen opens the door revealing BAINSLEY Dressed all in
white with plunging neckline and short skirt she looks like

a nurse outfitted by Fredericks of Hollywood

BAINSLEY

Surprise
QOHEN

- You Youre Bainsley
BAINSLEY

You never called I waited forever
QOHEN

She steps in inspecting Qohen closely

BAINSLEY
You look awful poor thing Jobys
right You need me

QOHEN
Mr Joby sent you

BAINSLEY
Joby doesnt send me anywhere
(pausing looking around)
Were just neighbors

She walks up the aisle in wonder Qohen follows

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
I cant believe you live in a church
How otherworldly I feel so holy

QOHEN
Its a chapel actually

Bainsley turns to him grasping his arm

BAINSLEY
(singing off-key)
Go-ing to the chap-el of loooove

She marches him up the aisle clutching his arm

QOHEN
(flustered)
We prefer not to be touched

Bainsley makes no move to turn him loose

BAINSLEY
The rent must be outrageous

QOHEN
Actually we own the building We bought
it from an insurance company Thered
been extensive fire damage

Qohen glances toward the shrine troubled

QOHEN (CONTD)
The previous occupants were an order of
gnostic monks whod sworn vows of
poverty chastity and silence
Apparently No one broke his vow to
yell Fire

BAINSLEY
Holy frying friars

They reach the work station but Bainsley pulls Qohen to the
bed She places a hand on his chest and pushes him backward

Qohen plops on the mattress Smiling coyly Bainsley leans
over him fingernails grazing his bald head

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
You have the most intriguing bone
structure so polished so pure

Qohen opens his mouth to speak but Bainsley puts a finger to
his lips She spins around and strides to the computer

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Mighty big hard drive you got here

She sits in front of the computer begins typing

QOHEN
Mr Joby seemed to think you might help
us get our call

BAINSLEY
Yeah he mentioned the call thing
(without looking)
Youre staring at me

QOHEN
Were terribly sorry

Bainsley squints at the screen typing rapidly

BAINSLEY
This is the goopiest software Ive ever
seen But your hardwares dreamy I can
definitely work with your hardware

QOHEN
Our problem is not with our computer

Bainsley suddenly SQUEALS swiveling away from the computer
She sucks on her middle finger teary-eyed

BAINSLEY
I just broke a nail on your big fat
stupid keyboard

Qohen jumps up and goes to her

QOHEN
Well get our first aid kit

BAINSLEY
(pouting)
Could you please just kiss it

QOHEN
Excuse us

BAINSLEY
Whenever I hurt myself my daddy would
kiss it and make it all better

Qohen stands wringing his hands

QOHEN
We fail to see how --

BAINSLEY
Please

Qohen hesitates then bends to place a hasty kiss on the tip
of her outstretched finger

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
You call that a kiss

Bainsley takes his hand slowly sucks his middle finger into
her mouth Her lips slide down and up lingering on the
fingertip in a soft kiss Her eyes dance with mischief

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
There all better

Puzzled paralyzed pitiful Qohen stares into her eyes
Dr Shrink-ROM pops onto the computer

DR SHRINK-ROM
I realize Im not authorized to present
an opinion but I couldnt help noticing
this womans attempt to project issues of
paternal abandonment onto you Given the
age difference between the two of you as
your psychiatrist I must warn you --

Bainsley grabs the mouse clicks on exit Dr Shrink-ROM
vanishes

BAINSLEY
Nosy bitch My daddy didnt abandon me
He died
Qohen opens his mouth as if to speak

Bainsley touches his cheek

Qohen stares into her eyes a moment then draws away
breaking the spell He turns his back to her

Bainsley rises wanders toward the shrine gazing about
BAINSLEY (CONTD)

I can help you Qohen but youre going
to be a challenge

She reaches for one of the pictures goes to flip it forward

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Whos your interior decorator

Qohen snaps to attention rushes toward her

QOHEN
Dont Dont touch those

Qohen pulls her away The picture falls face-down on the
floor glass CRACKING Qohen quickly picks it up carefully
re-hangs it face to the wall He breathes heavily

BAINSLEY
I prefer not to be manhandled

Regaining control Qohen turns to her

QOHEN
We didnt mean to hurt you

Bainsley rubs her arm

BAINSLEY
In case you got the wrong idea I should
tell you I dont do sexual intercourse
any more I dont care if a guy wraps
himself up like a latex mummy nothings
going inside me Way too dangerous

She shrugs it off smiling slowly

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Im into bioteletantric interfacing now
Its smart and safe and -- oh my God --
it feels so super-tingly

She spins away on a spiked heel short dress flaring
BAINSLEY (CONTD)

Got anything to eat around here Im
starving my butt off

INT KITCHEN - LATER

Bainsley perches prettily on the counter feet dangling
devouring a microwaved meal Qohen leans against the sink
watching her She licks her fingers mouth full

BAINSLEY
How can you stand this stuff

QOHEN
Weve grown accustomed to it

She stops chewing swallows
BAINSLEY
Youre staring at me again

QOHEN
(looking away)
Forgive us

BAINSLEY
Youre forgiven already

QOHEN
In our experience forgiveness doesnt
come so easily

BAINSLEY
What kind of guilt trip are you on

Qohen doesnt answer

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Here you are locked up all alone
waiting for what A phone call
Whats that all about

QOHEN
We prefer not to speak of it Our past
is painful

Bainsley hops down from the counter

BAINSLEY
Whos isnt

She touches his arm Qohen flinches She strokes his tense

neck Qohen visibly uncomfortable
BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Im here to help Qohen Trust me
Confessions good for the soul

QOHEN
Assuming we have a soul

BAINSLEY
Everybody has a soul

QOHEN
That remains to be proven

Bainsley draws away studying him

BAINSLEY
So I saved your life for nothing

Qohen wilts with guilt

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Come on Qohen How can I help if you
wont tell me anything

Qohen meets her eyes then looks away He takes a deep
breath

QOHEN
We we cant tell you

BAINSLEY
Why not

Qohen looks away embarrassed

QOHEN
Youre staring at us

MOMENTS LATER

Bainsley pokes through cupboards and drawers trying her best
not to look at Qohen

Qohen stands in the middle of the kitchen eyes closed hands
clasped nervously His voice is low on the edge of
breaking

QOHEN
We suffered a great loss and we
struggled for a long time to understand
the reason for it the reason we were
chosen if chosen we were to go on
living with this misfortune We came
to this place It seemed to suit us
We stopped eating We dulled our pain
with drink and drugs We lost all
hope We came to this place to die

Qohens face glows with a tortured fervor
Bainsley glances at him Her eyes fill with tears

QOHEN (CONTD)
One night a storm struck We lost power
We lit candles And in the flickering
shadows we decided to end our lives We
ingested every drug we could find

Bainsley stands at the sink turning the water on and off

QOHEN (CONTD)
Then the phone rang We answered A
voice said Qohen Leth and suddenly we
felt a flash of light We felta
current of pure energy connecting us to
something something greater
(MORE )

QOHEN (CONTD)
We suddenly knew clearly that we only had
to answer say Yes and the voice would
reveal the purpose behind our loss
would give us a reason to go on

Bainsley turns from the sink

BAINSLEY
-And then

Qohen opens his eyes His gaze is bland lifeless

QOHEN
We awoke in a hospital emergency room

BAINSLEY
And youve been waiting for a callback
ever since

Qohen nods

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
What kind of drugs did you take

QOHEN
You think were insane
BAINSLEY
It couldve been somebody selling time
shares I mean Life goes on Qohen
QOHEN

So it would appear The question is
to what end And we doubt you can
help us in providing an answer

Bainsley goes to him She worries the buttons on his shirt
head lowered She raises her eyes

BAINSLEY
I can try Let me try

Gently Qohen pulls her hands from his shirt
QOHEN
We told you We prefer not to be
touched
Bainsley bites her lip

BAINSLEY
I can get around that

INT CHAPEL - LATER

Lying scattered about the work station open boxes computer
parts accessories and cables

Bainsley models a VIRTUAL REALITY SUIT a tight translucent
shimmering red sheath that covers her from head to toe

She pirouettes seductively showing all her curves Sequin-
like transistors sparkle all over A braid of wires hangs
from her hood down her back ending in a computer jack

BAINSLEY
This thing is years ahead of the
competition It works on all the nerve
endings of course plus its synched
directly to the brains synapses

She pulls off the hood shaking her hair free
BAINSLEY (CONTD)
What do you think Joby said its based
on one of your projects
Qohen sits stiffly on his bed staring doubtfully
QOHEN
We never imagined our projects actually
had any purpose
BAINSLEY
Dont put it on your resume yet Top
secret Im the cyberspace test pilot

She pulls an identical and incredibly tiny-looking suit from
a box drapes it across Qohens lap

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
For you

QOHEN
Were supposed to wear this

BAINSLEY
One size fits all

She strokes his head

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
I can help you Qohen Trust me

She turns suddenly efficient and marches for the door

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
I bookmarked my website for you Just
put on the suit plug in and click on me
at midnight

QOHEN
Youre going out dressed like that

BAINSLEY
They can look but they cant touch
(blowing him a kiss)
Oh I cant wait Dont be late

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Qohen stands before the mirror wearing the virtual reality
suit He tugs uncomfortably at the crotch

QOHEN
(muttering)
One size does not fit all

INT CHAPEL - LATER

Suited up with braid of wires connected to his computer
Qohen sits before his monitor Bainsleys website features a
picture of lingerie-clad Bainsley and the words ENTER ME

Qohen moves his cursor to ENTER
DR SHRINK-ROM pops up on the screen her face troubled

DR SHRINK-ROM

QOHEN

DR SHRINK-ROM

QOHEN
We have no intentions of --

DR SHRINK-ROM
(interrupting)
Youve built a wall around yourself Is
she prepared for what shell find inside

Qohen slowly removes his hood

DR SHRINK-ROM (CONTD)
Shes an emotionally damaged girl You
are emotionally bereft Listen Qohen

QOHEN
This interruption is unacceptable We
insist you run a scan on your program

Dr Shrink-ROM frowns nods slowly Her movements run in
reverse for a moment -- RESET -- then snap back to normal

DR SHRINK-ROM
So sorry The glitch is fixed Dont
mind me Carry on Qohen

Dr Shrink-ROM disappears

Qohen stares perplexed Bainsleys sexy image awaits

Qohen hesitates then pulls down the hood clicks on ENTER
EXT TROPICAL ISLAND - BEACH - SUNSET

Swaying palm trees reach for a deep blue sky above

Wearing swimming trunks Qohen lies on a blanket spread over
the sand He gazes skyward puts a hand to his head to

discover a full head of hair

BAINSLEY
Like it

Bainsley kneels beside him wearing a skimpy bikini

They lie on a beach ocean before them lush jungle behind
them The sun sets the horizon awash with color

Bainsley pulls food from a picnic basket -- stone crab
chilled asparagus spears a loaf of bread -- arranging it on
the blanket Champagne chills in a bucket beside her
BAINSLEY (CONTD)
I made it just for you -- the hair
Something special for a special guy
Qohen runs his hands through his hair eyes distant

QOHEN
Were not sure its quite us

BAINSLEY
Dont be silly

Bainsley hands the bottle of champagne to Qohen

QOHEN
Actually we dont drink any longer

BAINSLEY
You can do anything you want here You
can drink and never get drunk You can
eat and never get full
She picks up a crab claw produces a ball-peen hammer
Qohen flinches as she SMASHES the claw open

She pulls a huge chunk of crab from the shell takes a
savage giggling bite brings the morsel to Qohens mouth

Qohen recoils but Bainsley insists pressing it to his lips

He takes a tentative nibble and despite himself shivers
with pleasure He grabs the rest and fills his mouth

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Good

Qohen looks at her swallows regains his reserve

QOHEN
Where is this place

BAINSLEY
All in your mind from my mind My
father used to clip pictures from travel
Magazines and put them on the fridge
When he saved up we were going to take a
vacation to some exotic tropical island

A fleeting look of sadness crosses Bainsleys face but she
GIGGLES suddenly and it is gone

She takes Qohens hand kisses his fingertips

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Do you feel this Qohen

Qohen melts for a moment then freezes up

QOHEN
Its not real

Bainsley sits back

BAINSLEY
Its better than real Youre in your
computer Im in mine Were connected
by memory chips and fiber optics Were
safe here Qohen This is my place

QOHEN
But what about our call

Bainsley puts a finger to his lips

BAINSLEY
You worry too much

She takes an asparagus spear nibbles its tip eyes dancing

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Trust me Qohen

Qohen looks at her in wonder

She grabs the champagne and thrusts it in his hands

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Lets get this party started

Qohen holds the bottle awkwardly Bainsley guides his hands
kisses him lightly on the lips

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Pop your cork boyfriend

Qohen looks into her eyes then struggling POPS the cork
Foam bubbles out of the bottle

Bainsley lunges over him to lap at it She grabs the bottle
and pours into his upturned mouth

Bainsley LAUGHING and Qohen SPUTTERING they roll and wrestle
in the sand champagne pouring all over them

MONTAGE - JUNGLE BEACH

1 Qohen and Bainsley walk a jungle path Bainsley plucks a
flower puts it behind Qohens ear He touches her hand

2 Bainsley climbs a tree beckoning Qohen to follow He
shakes his head She showers him with handfuls of leaves
then gives a TARZAN YELL and swings down on a vine colliding
with Qohen and knocking them both tumbling LAUGHING

3 Qohen and Bainsley sit at the shore watching the sunset
Bainsley stands stretches wades into the surf She turns
motions for Qohen to join her He shakes his head She
folds her arms sternly He shakes his head again She
splashes him Qohen stands dripping then WHOOPING dives
in surfacing before her and locking her in an embrace

END MONTAGE -- STAY IN SCENE

They gaze into each others eyes She kisses him He kisses
her back Bainsley takes a breath

BAINSLEY
Whoa Who knew

Qohen holds her eyes troubled

Bainsley kisses him again the passion building
Self-consciously Qohen breaks away wades out of the water
Bainsley follows him with her eyes SIGHING

EXT TROPICAL ISLAND - BEACH - LATER

Qohen and Bainsley wrapped in a blanket before a campfire
She bites into a tropical fruit He stares out to sea
The sun is still setting into the ocean

QOHEN
Shouldnt the sun have set by now

BAINSLEY
I like to keep it this way

Bainsley puts the fruit to Qohens lips He takes a bite
chews slowly Tears well up in his eyes

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Whats the matter

QOHEN
We dont deserve this

BAINSLEY
Dont deny yourself Qohen

She grabs his arm excitedly

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Hey Want to have some fun Take us

will do the rest

QOHEN
Were not at all certain --

BAINSLEY
Oh you Youre never certain Come on

controls Qohen Relax close your eyes
Reluctantly Qohen reclines closing his eyes
BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Now take us someplace special Picture

Qohens face tenses with effort
Bainsley leans over him strokes his forehead
BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Easy Qohen Dont strain your brain
Just imagine
Qohen grits his teeth his expression turning tortured

CUT

SPACE

Bald naked and curled tightly in the fetal position Qohen
floats amid a backdrop of brilliant stars His eyes open
wide staring as he fights the dread inside him

BAINSLEY
Wow What an imagination

Bainsley also naked slowly orbits around Qohen revelling
in the freedom of zero gravity

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
And what a dirty mind Wheres my
bikini Mr Leth
Oblivious Qohen continues to stare past her

Bainsley floats closer facing him

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Whats wrong

She reaches for him draws his rigid body close then turns
her head to follow his gaze

THE BLACK HOLE

A maelstrom of blazing interstellar dust and matter spirals
into its black depths carrying Bainsley and Qohen with it

Bainsley freaks She hugs Qohen tight and now they are
tumbling end over end

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Jesus Qohen stop it Make it stop

With great effort Qohen tears his gaze from the spinning
fiery black hole and shuts his eyes tight

INT HOUSE IN FLAMES - FLASHBACK

Qohen lands with a whiplash effect seated before his
computer Trembling he slowly removes his hood

COMPUTER MONITOR Error messages flash Symbols speed to a
HUMMING blur Suddenly -- POP -- the screen goes black

Qohen stares at his reflection in the screen his face in
shell-shocked torment He slowly reaches for the screen

As his finger nears a static spark CRACKLES He jerks his
hand back his face turning blank as a zombies

DISSOLVE TO
INT CHAPEL - THE DISFIGURED CRUCIFIX - LATER
Qohen lies in bed staring up at the crucifix

Qohen turns away from the intercom returning to his bed

BOB (VO)
They look at you funny unless you buy

The intercom BUZZES several more times then falls silent

The sound of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS from the vestibule Qohen
rises from bed just as the deadbolt turns and the door opens

Two acne-scarred young men SLIM CLONE and CHUBS CLONE stand
in the doorway dressed in white short-sleeved shirts with
bulging pocket protectors sloppy ties thick glasses High-
belted trousers show white socks in black wingtips Hair
slicked to the side frazzled strands sticking up in back

One is fat and the other skinny but they could be twins
They enter flank the doorway look around suspiciously

Suddenly Bob races in Hes dressed in sneakers untucked T-
shirt and long baggy shorts with huge cargo pockets
Headphones hang around his neck

He rushes up the aisle toward Qohen face twisted in agony

BOB (CONTD)

Qohen stands gaping

BOB (CONTD)
Bathroom-bathroom-bathroom

Bob charges through the door to the kitchen He WHIMPERS
He reappears in the doorway face desperate

Qohen slowly points the direction

Bob races into the bathroom the HISS of piss on porcelain

Qohen looks at the Clones bewildered They walk down the
aisle side by side toward him

Bob exits the bathroom wiping his brow dramatically
BOB (CONTD)

Bob types rapidly the screen changing re-configuring
Suddenly his own image appears on the screen as recorded by
the ManCam hanging from the crucifix

BOB (CONTD)

QOHEN

Bob types a series of commands He stops finger poised
above the Enter key He grins up at ManCam waving His
image waves back on the monitor

BOB (CONTD)
Bobs on the job Dad

He hits Enter and his image disappears ManCam blinks out
Bob begins typing and clicking at superhuman speed

BOB (CONTD)
Now I gotta clean up your mess Pop

code or getting ass-banged by a troop of
rabid baboons Be sure to phrase your
answer in the form of a question

Qohen blinks Blinks again

QOHEN
We wish you would curb your liberal use
of profane language Its unseemly
BOB

Excuse my freaking Fortran Wouldnt

LATER
Qohen lies in bed staring at the ceiling

Bob pushes himself back from the computer rubbing his eyes
He COUGHS SNIFFLES SNEEZES

QOHEN

BOB

Bob wipes his nose on his sleeve WHEEZING

BOB (CONTD)

QOHEN

BOB

Bob SNEEZES again He pulls an asthma inhaler from his
pocket takes a quick blast

INT CHAPEL - NIGHT
Qohen at his computer in a session with Dr Shrink-ROM

QOHEN

assigned his son to get us our call We
fear hes much too young to be entrusted
with a responsibility of such paramount
importance We fear that he --

DR SHRINK-ROM
Dont be such a wuss Q

Qohen is speechless with surprise
DR SHRINK-ROM (CONTD)

Bobs a genius whiz-kid super-brain And
if you dont believe it

Dr Shrink-ROM stands A RAP BEAT plays in the background

DR SHRINK-ROM (CONTD)
Yo look Shut up and listen

Qohen stares at her incredulous

DR SHRINK-ROM (CONTD)
We cannot wont not help you Q
We wanna help you aint it true
But we wont help you get your call
We will not help you not at all
Until you first shed verbal truss
First-person plural Qs-R-Us

We got a plan for your sure cure
That gives you singular allure

But help from this computer whiz
Must come without the plural biz
We do not like first-person plural

INT CHAPEL —- MORNING

Qohen hesitates glances toward the shrine
QOHEN (CONTD)
A former therapist suggested it as a
temporary coping mechanism

BOB

QOHEN
(suddenly stern)
How did you tamper with Dr Shrink-ROM

Bob grins still typing

wolfish bite while typing one-handed

BOB (CONTD)

He tosses the crust over his shoulder Instantly a scruffy
rodent bags it drags it through a crack in the floor

Bob nods toward the pizza box

BOB (CONTD)
Help yourself to the rest

QOHEN
Were afraid our diet precludes pizza

BOB
Put it in the fridge then

Bob attacks the keyboard with both hands

Qohen retrieves the pizza box carries it toward the kitchen
He absently licks a bit of sauce from his finger and halts
eyes closed A look of fleeting pleasure crosses his face

He opens his eyes frowns making sure Bob hasnt noticed

INT CHAPEL - NIGHT

Qohen lies in bed tossing and turning unable to sleep
He goes to the shrine lights a candle stares at its flame
As if against his will he turns a picture face forward

It is a close-up profile of his wifes face Shes looking
at something off camera LAUGHING

The picture comes to life and she turns to face Qohen her
LAUGHTER DYING She looks at him with pity

Qohen replaces the picture face to the wall
He trudges to his work station sits at the computer

Qohen touches the mouse the menu appears He sees
Bainsleys icon hesitates then clicks

A live video of Bainsley fills the screen Barely dressed in
white lingerie she stretches seductively on a bed with red
satin sheets eyes closed She MOANS passionately into a
headset microphone her hands caressing her corseted breasts

Raunchy CHATROOM MESSAGES scroll below her image
Qohens head spins

Bainsley smiles wickedly her eyes slowly opening She licks
her lips with a sultry smile then sits up smile freezing

BAINSLEY (V0O)

Bob scrolls and types at lightning speed as Qohen stands back
in awe The symbols re-configure in tidy rows

BOB (CONTD)
There See Easy Now you do it

Bob stands and Qohen hesitantly takes his place He stares
helplessly at the screen fingers poised above the keyboard
Qohens shoulders slump in despair

Bob leans over him coaxing He touches Qohens shoulder
Qohen stiffens

QOHEN

They all leave

INT CHAPEL - NIGHT

Qohen sits at his computer scrolling through page after page
of neat and orderly signs and symbols his lips unconsciously
forming soundless words as he strives to comprehend

The Intercom BUZZES Qohen raises his eyes to the crucifix

MOMENTS LATER

Qohen opens the door and Bainsley is in his arms Her
trench coat flashes open revealing shes naked underneath

Qohen pulls it closed She GIGGLES
QOHEN

She wraps her arms around his neck kisses him

Qohen resists at first but then closes his eyes and despite

himself begins to kiss her back
And now Bainsley breaks away hot and flustered
BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Easy killer Let a girl catch her

Qohen turns away struggling to contain himself

Bainsley pulls a VR suit from her coat pocket shakes it out

BAINSLEY (CONTD)

Qohen stares at the suit aghast

BAINSLEY (CONTD)

Bainsley wraps the VR suit around Qohens neck pulls him

Bainsleys eyes blaze
BAINSLEY
Im starting to wonder myself I just

She turns to go
BAINSLEY (CONTD)

Maybe you really dont have a soul
But Im ready to find out when you are

She leaves closing the door behind her

Qohen stares at the closed door then shoulders slumping
he slowly returns to his computer

He stares at the screen rubs bleary eyes tilts his head as
if listening His eyes light on the crucifix and slowly
widen as a thought occurs to him

QOHEN
(under his breath)
Impossible

He sits up straight scrolls through the columns of signs and
symbols faster and faster eyes sharp and swiftly moving

INT CHAPEL -— DAY

Qohen stands by the door signing a receipt He gives it to

purpose of the Zero Theorem

Bob pauses

BOB
Youre shitting me

QOHEN
Language

BOB
(smiling pleased)
Give it up Q-dog

Qohen rubs his forehead stares up at the crucifix

QOHEN
As far as weve been able to ascertain
the Zero Theorem employs a densely
compacted language that seeks to codify
all known phenomena in the universe

BOB
Try it in English Q

QOHEN
The Zero Theorem seeks to explain the
purpose of existence

Bobs eyes widen
BOB
You are fuh-reaking shitting me Holy
crap Holy crap That is just too cool
Bob turns back to the computer types frantically
QOHEN
We nail this bad boy were talking
groupie chicks from arts and sciences

Qohen remains silent glumly staring Bob looks at him

BOB
Whats the matter Lets roll Q

QOHEN
The project is impossible

BOB
No way to know without trying

QOHEN
But if we try and fail then you and your
father wont help us to receive our call
Bob whirls around suddenly impatient
BOB

Qohen takes a step back

QOHEN

in the face water trickling down his cheeks like tears
INT CHAPEL - SHRINE - LATER
Qohen quietly exits the bathroom and stops

Bob stands in front of the shrine looking at the photos all

Qohens breath catches His eyes burn But then he breathes
deeply He goes to the shrine stands quietly next to Bob

Bob looks at Qohen Their eyes lock

BOB

Qohen stares at the photos his Wife his Son his former
self in various family poses various degrees of happiness

QOHEN
There was a fire

He gazes up to the chapels charred beams jaw set stoically
QOHEN (CONTD)
And we can never understand the reason
until we receive our call
Bob tears up He touches Qohens arm drops his hand
Qohen turns a pictures face to the wall again then another
QOHEN (CONTD)

memories are painful

Bob turns away from Qohen overwhelmed with emotion

BOB
Oh Jesus Q I feel so bad

Qohen nods hesitates

QOHEN

Our problem is its pointless
BOB

What is
QOHEN

The Zero Theorem Follow the math

Dont you see The point is to prove
that there is no point All of existence
is a cosmic accident It started from
nothing and will end in nothing

Bob moves about the work station idly picking up objects

BOB
I guess thats not good

QOHEN
It would make our lives meaningless

Bob nods distracted He shrugs

BOB
So lets prove Zip-Ts wrong

QOHEN
Then your father wont give you a car

BOB

Fuck him I gotta prove something Q
Lets do it

QOHEN
How

BOB
I dont know Use your imagination

Qohen stares at the monitor thinking

QOHEN
Energy begets matter Matter begets
energy According to the theorem
everything must be accounted for In
order to disprove it we must find
something that cant be counted
something outside the equation

BOB
Such as

Qohen closes his eyes then suddenly opens them realizing

QOHEN
Our soul

BOB
Is that all

QOHEN
It may be all weve been waiting for

Bob opens the box and pulls out the VR suit which now sports
even more wires and transistors and a crudely sewn big gold
Q on its chest He hands it to Qohen pushes him out of
his chair takes his place and begins typing rapidly

Qohen eyes the suit in his hands with dismay

QOHEN
More virtual reality

BOB
Nope I rewired it This babys a real
live inner-space soul-search suit All I
gotta do is rig an interface with ManCom

QOHEN
What are you talking about

BOB
Energy Q-dude Everything inside you

Bob SNEEZES wipes his nose on his sleeve
Qohen stares at him
BOB (CONTD)
Dont look at me like that Q It sounds
crazy but I got it all figured out
QOHEN

Qohen delicately traces the Q on the suit with a fingertip

QOHEN
Is it dangerous

Bob meets his gaze

BOB
Jesus Q ManComs the biggest
baddest neural net computer ever made
Your brain could come out like a carrot
in a blender for all I know
He looks away helplessly

Qohen steps back
Bainsley enters Spotting Bob she raises puzzled eyes
QOHEN

» and Qohen stares at her in disbelief
BAINSLEY (CONTD)

Qohen raises his eyes to the chapels charred rafters A
pair of pigeons nest atop a crossbeam softly COOING

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
You and me -- we connected

Qohen looks deep into her eyes

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
We can be together for real

Qohen breaks away looks at Bob as if for an answer Bobs
face is a study in torn emotions

BAINSLEY (CONTD)
Qohen

Qohen gazes toward the shrine all the pictures there He
hesitates then hugs Bainsley close whispers in her ear

QOHEN
Were afraid we cant

Bainsleys eyes brim with tears She kisses him softly

BAINSLEY
(desperately)
Oh run away with me Qohen Please

Qohen kisses her eyes shut tight
Then his eyes snap open
- and he backs away from her mastering his emotions
Bainsley searches his stoic face A SOB escapes her
She turns away and walks out
Qohen closes the door

Emotionless he turns to Bob

BOB
Damn Q You got any heart at all

Qohen doesnt answer

BOB (CONTD)
Um Want to suit up

Qohen closes his eyes

BOB (CONTD)

Qohen and Bob sit under a big oak tree backs against its
trunk Bob looks at Qohen looks away hesitates

BOB
Whats it like getting old Q

Qohen gazes into the branches eyes clouding voice robotic
QOHEN
You will question the worth of your life
Nothing will satisfy you You will be
alone You will feel empty as a gourd

Qohen snaps out of it sees Bobs consternation

QOHEN (CONTD)
Excuse our nihilism

Bob shrugs watches Lacy and Bonnie The kite crashes to the
ground again Lacy and Bonnie MOAN at the failure GIGGLING

BOB
A little tail would make that thing more
aerodynamically active And speaking of
a little tail that girl is hot

Bonnie tries again to get the kite airborne She shoots Bob
a fleeting look smiling shyly

BOB (CONTD)
(wistfully)
I dont know any girls my age
(snapping out of it)
Think I should get a tongue stud

The question draws Qohen out of his despair

QOHEN
For what purpose

BOB
Chicks dude Chicks dig the metal

Qohen stares into the distance trying to take the question
seriously searching for the proper response
QOHEN
In our experience the female is
attracted to the male in direct inverse
proportion to the males misguided
efforts to attract her attention

BOB
Fuckin huh

Qohen smiles

QOHEN
Chicks dig the real you

Bob reaches over squeezes Qohens shoulder

BOB
I bet you were a good dad Q

Qohen attempts to speak but his emotion overcomes him

Bob pats his arm and looks away embarrassed He spies a HOT
DOG VENDOR and jumps to his feet losing his balance

BOB (CONTD)
Whoa I need food Do us a coupla dogs
Q Coupla wieners for a coupla weenies

Eyes misting Qohen watches Lacy and Bonnie playing

QOHEN
May we have relish on ours

Bob grins trots off towards the hot dog vendor

MOMENTS LATER

Qohen sits deep in thought gazing into the oaks branches
The LAUGHTER of Lacy and Bonnie echoes He looks at them
They cant get the kite airborne but theyre having fun

Qohen wrestles with a sudden impulse

Bonnie holds the kite while Lacy at the other end of 50 feet
of string prepares to run with it

Qohen stands takes off his sunglasses takes a deep breath
and tries on a smile It fits nicely He approaches Bonnie

QOHEN
Beautiful day for kite flying isnt it

Bonnie looks at him the way one might look at a quadriplegic
in a wheelchair She smiles uncertainly

BONNIE
Except theres not enough wind

Lacy eyes Qohen suspiciously drops the string and moves
toward them

QOHEN
Well fix that

Qohen produces a clean handkerchief from his pocket shakes
it out with a flourish then bends down and ties it to the
tail of the kite

Bob returns with one-and-a-half hotdogs the missing half in
his mouth He stops and stares at Qohen fixing the kite for
the grateful girls then quickly swallows shoves the other
half of his hotdog in his mouth

LATER

Qohen sits beneath the oak tree eyes closed savoring the
final bite of his hotdog

He opens his eyes with satisfaction watches Bob and Bonnie
holding onto the string of the airborne kite

Lacy strolls down by the pond leaving them alone She looks
up waves to Qohen smiling He waves back

Bob pulls the string the kite dips barely missing the
ground soars skyward He and Bonnie LAUGH with delight

Qohens eyes brim with joy then slowly darken

Bob spots Qohen looking at him He hands Bonnie the string
whispers in her ear She smiles and squeezes his hand

Bob ambles to Qohen plops down next to him beaming

BOB

Q-dog How you doing bud
QOHEN

Well You
BOB

Whoa You know

Qohen smiles puts a hand softly on Bobs arm

QOHEN
We know
BOB
Look About that soul-search thing

Bob looks off at Bonnie The kite is losing altitude She
scrambles backwards to keep it in the air

BOB (CONTD)
You dont have to do it I will

QOHEN
But Why

BOB
Just to show the bastard

QOHEN
No Youre much too young Were not at
all certain --
Suddenly Bob pokes his finger sharply into Qohens forehead
Qohen winces
BOB
Wake the fuck up Q You think youre
the only one who wants a call

Qohen sits dazed

QOHEN
Sorry I never thought

Bob stares at him

BOB
What did you say

QOHEN
I said Im sorry I --

BOB
Q Dude You just turned singular

QOHEN
(confused)
I did
(hearing himself smiling)
I suppose I did

BOB
Jeez I shoulda slapped you upside the
head the day we met

Bob looks at Bonnie again The kite has crashed and shes
untangling herself from a swirl of string He sighs

BOB (CONTD)
I guess we better get back to work

Bob stands Qohen rises too puts a hand on his arm
stopping him

QOHEN
No Not yet Theres theres someone
I have to see first
Bob stares at him uncomprehending then breaks into a grin

BOB
Youre going after Bainsley

QOHEN
If you dont mind me leaving you here

Bob looks over at Bonnie smiles

BOB
Meet you back at the tomb later

Qohen hesitates Bob playfully rubs Qohens bald head

BOB (CONTD)
Go get her Q I can wait

INT CAB - MOMENTS LATER
Qohen gets into a cab slams the door

DRIVER
Where to

Qohen views him from behind short-sleeved white shirt tie
sticking out of collar unruly hair slicked to the side In
the rearview mirror a flash of thick glasses

Qohen catches his breath The driver looks like a Clone

DRIVER (CONTD)
Nowhere to go

EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Qohen runs from the cab dodging traffic to the other side of
the street He races down the sidewalk heart pounding

INT BUS - LATER

Qohen sits in the rear of a nearly-empty bus gazing out the
window as they travel through an upscale suburb

He closes his eyes and rests his head against the glass

When he opens his eyes he spots a rider up front short-
sleeved shirt and tie thick glasses

He looks around acne-scarred faces slicked hair too-short
trousers white socks in scuffed wingtips

He ducks down this cant be real

The bus WHEEZES to a stop

A line of Clone-like men board through the front door

Panicking Qohen jumps up and pushes through the rear door

EXT UPSCALE STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Qohen runs lungs aching GASPING Everywhere he looks
Clones driving their cars walking their dogs watering

their begonias Clones and more Clones fat skinny short

tall but all strangely identical in demeanor and dress

all stopping what theyre doing to stare at Qohen

He veers off the street cuts through

BACKYARDS

dodging trees and flower beds koi ponds and patio
furniture running running running in desperation

He vaults a fence catches his foot sprawls on the ground

He lifts his face to the sky with a strangled SOB Then his
eyes harden He gets to his feet sets off running again

EXT JOBYS HOUSE - LATER
Out of breath and dishevelled Qohen pounds on the door
Joby opens it all jovial
JOBY
Well if it isnt my old pal Quinn Come
in Have a beer Have some tap water
Joby stops deep in thought
JOBY (CONTD)
Wait a minute Youre supposed to be
baby-sitting your little buddy Bob You

QOHEN
Where is Bainsley

JOBY
Management wont like that No Itll

QOHEN
Bainsley Where does she live

Joby squints in thought taps his lip

JOBY
Bainsley Nope aint ringing a bell

Qohen grabs Joby by the shirt-front
Joby snaps to attention eyes narrowing
JOBY (CONTD)
She packed up and took off Chasing the

wind Shes the least of your worries

QOHEN
Youre lying Youre Managements tool

JOBY
You poor bastard Were all tools Get
used to it Quinn
Qohen slowly releases him
QOHEN
(helplessly by rote)
My name is Qohen Q
His voice dies out

JOBY
I know I know who you are Do you

Joby steps back looks at Qohen with pity shakes his head

JOBY (CONTD)
Go home Q

The door closes Qohen stares at it wracked with
indecision then suddenly takes off running down the street

INT CHAPEL - NIGHT
Exhausted Qohen lets himself in looks around fearfully

QOHEN
Bob

The room is dark gloomy lit only by the sputtering candles
at the shrine and the ghostly glow of his computer

Holding pews for support Qohen drags himself to the shrine
He falls to his knees buries his face in his hands

QOHEN (CONTD)
Bob

After a while he rises wiping his face He staggers to his
bed and collapses with a GROAN exhausted and disheartened

QOHEN (CONTD)
Oh Bob

A RUSTLING from under the bed Qohen jumps to his feet
BOB (0S)
(voice weak gasping)
Dust bunny biosphere down here

Bob crawls out from under the bed shivering and COUGHING

Qohen beams with joy wraps Bob in a bear hug

BOB (CONTD)

Clones came by twic

e Theyll be back

Bob SNEEZES WHEEZES teeth chattering Qohen releases him
smooths Bobs sweaty hair from his forehead

QOHEN
Youre burning up

Bob pushes Qohens hand away

BOB

pulls out his inhaler

Just a fucking fever Q Dont wig out

QOHEN

You need medical attention

Suddenly dizzy Bob sits on the bed

BOB
Nah Just get me

No way I wanna see

BATHROOM - LATER

And bar the door

Bob lies in the tub in his boxers Qohen kneels beside him

BOB

She gave me her number Her names

Bonnie Shes the

Qohen soothes Bobs forehead with a washcloth silent

BOB (CONTD)

So howd you score

QOHEN

BOB

Wish she was here giving me a bath

QOHEN

So do I But I seem to have lost her

Bob COUGHS at length closes his eyes

BOB

Nobodys ever really lost Q-dog Well

your fucking call

Bob drifts off mid-sentence

excuse my

His ragged breathing softens

Qohen smooths back his hair presses a cheek to his forehead
lingers there then lifts him from the tub He drapes a
towel over him steps back struggling under Bobs weight

Qohen slips and falls against the mirror keeping his hold on
Bob Righting himself Qohen glances to the broken mirror

Amid the shattered glass a red light shines
CHAPEL - MOMENTS LATER

Qohen tucks Bob into bed Hand on Bobs brow he checks his
temperature He draws back his hand still worried

BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Qohen raises the ball-peen hammer and SMASHES the ManCam
Its red light blinks out

CHAPEL - LATER

Qohen drags a pew down the aisle stacks it against two
others blocking the door

CHAPEL - MORNING

The doors deadlock CLICKS open

Qohen awakens with a start sitting in a chair next to the
bed where Bob still sleeps softly SNORING He removes his
hand from Bobs head listening disoriented

The door shudders moves Pews GROAN as they move

Qohen springs up Bob still sleeping and rushes to the door

A THUD from outside moves the blockade The door opens a
crack Qohen throws himself against it with all his might

The THUD and GRUNT of shoulder on door pushing Qohen back
The door opens a foot Qohen looks around in a panic
Bob sits up in bed bleary-eyed with fever

BOB
Q

Qohen sprints to the shrine picks up the candle stand in
both hands and runs back down the aisle Candles fly
landing in piles of computer printouts igniting them

With a STRANGLED SCREAM Qohen hurls the stand at the door

Wrought iron wedges The door THUDS and THUMPS stuck

But when Qohen turns around to check on Bob he sees
FIRE

Its a small paper fire but in Qohens eyes it turns to
FLASHBACK - BURNING HOUSE

Qohen fights through smoke and flames CRASHES through a
window rolls on the ground smoldering SOBBING

BACK TO SCENE

Qohen throws himself on the pile of burning printouts eyes
clenched tight mouth open in a soundless scream He rolls
over and over burning himself but putting out the fire

Bob gets out of bed wobbling with fever He COUGHS
WHEEZES then collapses on the bed unconscious

Qohen rushes to him

The door bursts open pews and wrought iron SCREECHING
against the floor Slim and Chubs push through breathless

Qohen cradles Bob in his arms The Clones walk up the aisle

QOHEN
Take him to a hospital

Chubs reaches for Bob Qohen hugs him closer for a moment
then carefully places him in Chubs arms Bobs breathing is
ragged Qohen smooths the hair from his eyes

QOHEN (CONTD)
Please Hurry

The Clones turn to go Slim glances at Qohens work station
SLIM
Your times up Well be back for the
hardware tomorrow Dont touch anything
They head out the door with Bob Qohen stares after them
CHAPEL - LATER

Qohen kneels before the wrecked shrine a single burning
candle in his cupped hands

He stares through the flickering flame at the photos
LATER

Qohen sits at his computer dressed in the soul-search suit

MONITOR MANCOM READY FOR INPUT

Qohen traces the Q on his chest then pulls on the hood
He hits the enter key

A low-pitched HUM as the program powers up
Monitor fills with STATIC White noise HISSES
Qohen sits rigid waiting

Five long seconds pass

HISSING stops HUM winds down Monitor blinks The BLACK
HOLE SCREENSAVER appears

Silence
Qohen raises his face to the crucifix in despair

He touches the braid of wires at the back of his hood
adjusting them and suddenly

A FLASH OF LIGHT

SPACE - MANCOM MAINFRAME - CONTINUOUS

Qohen spins weightless through labyrinthine corridors There
is no up or down Only a dizzying expanse of computer banks
stretching as far as the eye can see

Qohen weaves his way through a BUZZ of circuitry

As he approaches a computer bank its lights FLASH and
MANCOM PORTAL -— CONTINUOUS

-- Qohen is spinning headfirst through a SPARKING rainbow-
lit tunnel of circuits Qohen is inside ManCom

His braid of wires flies behind him shooting FLAMES

Electrical currents arc from every passing circuit board to
the trailing wires creating a comets tail of voltage

Qohen clutches his head in pain turning sharp angles amid
explosions of color accelerating at every turn a bolt of
SCREAMING lightning

Up ahead spinning toward him the end of the tunnel Space

And spinning in the center of Space The Black Hole

Qohen closes his eyes in terror
SPACE -— MANCOM CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

Qohen opens his eyes to find himself motionless standing on

solid flooring ManComs computer banks behind him the

control console in front of him opening onto starry space

and beyond that the Black Hole looms

A dark Figure hunches over the control console

Qohen removes his hood catches his breath He steps closer

QOHEN
Bob

The Figure swivels to face Qohen It is Management dressed

in his taupe suit the Black Hole rotating behind him

MANAGEMENT
Im afraid you wont find my son here
Mr Leth Hes been hospitalized

QOHEN
Is he Will he be all right

Management stands turns to face the Black Hole his voice
low and hoarse as if speaking to himself

MANAGEMENT
If I believed in miracles Id be praying
for one now My son is not well

Hes never been well Ive tried to
protect him but hes always chafed at my
touch Eventually a father must let
go Surely you know that Mr Leth

He turns to face Qohen smiling sadly
Qohen looks around

QOHEN
Where precisely am I

MANAGEMENT
This is your mind Mr Leth This is
your mind in ManCom

QOHEN
Then are you real or just in my mind

MANAGEMENT
Is there really a difference Youre
part of the Neural Net now All of your
knowledge all of your being has been
incorporated into ManCom

Qohen stares in despair
QOHEN
What is the answer

MANAGEMENT
That depends upon the question

Qohens jaw clenches

QOHEN
What am I living for

MANAGEMENT

(amused)
Good question Mr Leth but posed to the
wrong person Youve apparently mistaken
me for an entity of considerably higher
power I am not the source of your call
I am neither God nor Devil I am simply
a man who seeks the truth

QOHEN
And what is the truth

MANAGEMENT
Youre looking it dead in the eye

He sweeps his hand toward the Black Hole behind him
MANAGEMENT (CONTD)
Chaos encapsulated This is all there is
in the end as it was in the beginning

Qohen stares at the Black hole in dismay

QOHEN
Then youve proven the Zero Theorem

Management sits on the edge of the control panel frowning

MANAGEMENT
Not quite ManCom is still as you put
it crunching the data But its only
a matter of time

Qohen struggles to control his anger

QOHEN
Why would you ever want to prove that all
is for nothing

Management adjusts his tie with finicky precision

MANAGEMENT
The saddest aspect of mankinds belief in
a purpose beyond this life is that it
makes this life meaningless -- a way
station on the road to eternity

The black hole swirls behind Management a yawning maw of
emptiness framing his head like a dark halo

MANAGEMENT (CONTD)
Youve persisted in believing that a call
could give your life meaning Youve
waited and waited for that call to come
And as a result youve led a meaningless
life We give our own lives meaning
even if we cant understand the reason
Every rose has its thorns Mr Leth

Management approaches Qohen puts a hand on his shoulder

MANAGEMENT (CONTD)

(sadly)
Im sorry Mr Leth Were not really
all that different you and I But

ultimately you must find your own way
Qohen stares at Managements hand
and suddenly Management disappears
Qohen slumps for a moment staring at the Black Hole

Then eyes burning he seats himself at the control panel
He locates a keyboard begins typing desperately

Nothing

Frustrated Qohen leaps to his feet rips the keyboard from
the panel and hurls it at a nearby computer bank

The keyboard shatters without doing any damage but suddenly
the computer bank lights up like a flashing pinball machine

Qohen stares at the light-show in wonder

Frantically he begins demolishing the control panel hurling
pieces at the computer banks He heaves up the desk-top

and something falls CLANGING to the floor
It is a ball-peen hammer Qohen stoops to pick it up
He holds it in hishand flexing its weight smiling coldly
And then he goes berserk throwing himself against bank after
bank of computers wildly swinging SMASHING swinging
grinning like a demon on fire
He rampages down the corridor of computer banks hammering
And while each machine remains undamaged all flash wild

lights after he hits them a frenzied flashing and WHIRRING
that seems to match Qohens unbridled anger

He finally falls to his knees weary and raises his eyes

All the way down the endless corridor ManComs computer
banks are powering up

He turns and still on his knees gazes at the Black Hole
It seems to loom closer larger

Qohens eyes light up like fire as the realization hits him
Qohen gets to his feet He pulls up his hood places a hand
on the Q on his chest pats it for reassurance raises his
hammer high

then takes off at a sprint up the corridor

Computer banks flash spark explode in his wake

He vaults the control panel in a single bound and is suddenly
soaring through

SPACE

Arms outstretched hammer leading the way a comets tail of
fire and light trailing him Qohen flies straight toward

THE BLACK HOLE

It spins closer and closer an open mouth of darkness as
Qohen streaks toward

IMPACT
EXPLOSION OF COLORS
DISSOLVE TO
EXT TROPICAL ISLAND - BEACH - SUNSET
A brilliant sun is setting half-submerged in the ocean
Qohen stands on the beach mesmerized by the sunset
He drops his hammer comes back to himself turns around

The island is just the way he and Bainsley left it so long
ago Their footsteps dot the sand The campfire burns low

He walks to the campfire picks up the rumpled blanket hugs
it to his chest remembering

QOHEN
(softly)
Bainsley

He drops the blanket stands staring at the sunset

He lowers his eyes closes them and when he opens them

He sees his Wife and Son sitting nearby on the beach
His wife helps his son build a sand castle

Slowly they both turn to look at Qohen His Son waves
goodbye to him his face joyful His Wife raises a hand in
farewell smiling and nodding slowly as if offering him
absolution as if releasing him to live his life

Qohen smiles back his eyes filling with tears

He turns to face the nearly-set sun again The horizon is a
riot of crimson reflecting off the sea

He raises his outstretched arms hands seeming to cradle the
sun Slowly he lets his hands descend

The sun begins to set Qohen lowers his hands to his sides
and the last of the sun dips into the ocean

Qohen turns around Stars twinkle in the darkening sky above
the jungle He stares up at them

FADE TO WHITE
A phone softly RINGS and RINGS
FADE IN
INT CHAPEL -— DAY

Qohen sits at his work station fully suited and still
plugged in though the computer is dead

The phone RINGS and RINGS

He slowly pulls down his hood stares at the RINGING phone
He reaches for it then stops

QOHEN
(under his breath)
No No more

He rubs his eyes His fingers trail down his cheeks With a
look of surprise he feels the top of his head

His face and head show the trace of stubble
The phone stops RINGING

Qohen unplugs his braid of wires from the computer and
stands weak and dizzy

He makes his way to the Shrine gazes at the pictures there
He touches the one with the broken glass a sad smile curving
his trembling lips then wipes the tears from his eyes

He smashes the frame slips the photo under the torso of his
suit next to his heart

He takes a candle back to his work station He touches the
flame to a pile of computer printouts starting a small fire
He watches as the fire grows

The phone RINGS

Distracted irritated Qohen snatches it up

QOHEN (CONTD)
(into phone)
Im afraid you have the wrong number

BOB (VO)
Jesus Q I been calling for the last
hour Where the fuck you been

QOHEN
(joyfully)
Bob Where are you

BOB (VO)
On the way I just left the hospital

He watches the flames grow He eases back from the fire
trailing the phone cord behind him

QOHEN
Youre youre all right then

BOB (VO)
Miraculous recovery the docs refused to
believe I had to wait till everybody
took a smoke break to escape

Qohen backs further away from the fire

BOB (VO) (CONTD)
Listen Q dont put on that VR suit

QOHEN
Um Im wearing it right now

BOB (VO)
Well dont plug in I heard from one of
the Clones ManCom had a meltdown last
night Fucking things babbling like a
baby on acid Not a safe trip at all

Qohen smiles

QOHEN
Ill keep that in mind

BOB (VO)
Good Go outside and wait for me Ill
be there in a minute
The line CLICKS dead
The fire is raging now the computer in flames spewing
noxious smoke Qohen backs away as far as the taut phone
line will allow then punches 9-1-1 on the handset
QOHEN
(into phone)
Yes Id like to report a fire
EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Qohen stands on the sidewalk face aimed at the sunny sky

PASSERSBY stare at his costume but Qohen doesnt notice

He turns to look at his chapel Smoke billows out the
windows He walks to the curb

and suddenly spots Management flanked by Chubs and Slim
standing in a shop doorway across the street

A sports car comes screeching to a halt in front of Qohen
The tinted window rolls down and Bob pokes his head out

Get in 1 stole this from the old man
Every Clone in townll be after me

Qohen circles the car to the passenger side

Hand on the door he hesitates

Across the way the Clones move forward eyes menacing

But Management stops them with a motion of his hand

He nods to Qohen puts a finger to his lips and smiling
sadly takes one last look at Bob

Then he turns and goes into the shop the Clones following
BOB (CONTD)
(frantic)
Come on Q

Qohen gets in the car

INT CAR -— CONTINUOUS
Qohen puts on his seatbelt
A fire engines siren WAILS in the distance getting closer

BOB
The bastard has the heat after me

Bob hits the gas and peels out steering wildly

QOHEN
Please dont refer to your father as a
bastard Its unseemly
(hesitantly)

Are you old enough to drive

BOB
Who cares Were on the lam Q

Bob comes to a jerky stop at a red light He rests his
forehead on the steering wheel

BOB (CONTD)
Jesus Q I cant believe what Ive gone
through lately Im totally wiped

QOHEN
Perhaps you and I should take a vacation

BOB
Where to

QOHEN
Im picturing an exotic tropical island

Bob looks at him skeptically

BOB
You really think we can find her

Qohen gazes out the window into the distance
BOB (CONTD)
You know how many tropical islands there
are in the world
Qohen turns to Bob smiling
QOHEN
As it happens I know the exact number
Youre not the only genius in this car

Bob looks at Qohen and slowly breaks into a huge grin

The light turns green

BOB
What the fuck are we waiting for

Bob floors it the tires squeal and Qohens eyes widen
EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

The car careens down the street barely missing a fire engine
going in the other direction

Qohens wailing voice rises above the SIRENS

QOHEN (VO)
Un-fucking-seemly

FADE OUT
