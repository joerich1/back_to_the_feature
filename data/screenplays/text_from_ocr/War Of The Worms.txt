OPEN ON THE NIGHT SKY

JACK (VO)
I got my first telescope when I was
ten I was pretty disappointed when
I heard ninety percent of the stars
in the sky couldn’t be seen because
their light was drowned out by the
light of cities Well tonight the
cities have gone darkand the
sky’s on fire

TILT DOWN REVEALING
EXT SKI CABIN - NIGHT

JACK’S POV Crouching behind a BIRDBATH looking OVER THE
SIGHTS OF A SHOTGUN scanning the DARK WOODS

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
Too bad I can’t really enjoy it
Neither can the guy I just shot

A BLOODY CORPSE draped across a picket fence

JACK (CONTD)
Robbie Bialowicz Sophomore Nice
kid big smile I hope I don’t have
to kill him again

BOOMBOOMBOOM

The FULL MOON in the birdbath WAVERS with faint deep
impacts like the footsteps of giants

JACK (CONTD)

Yeah it’s like that One of those
billion stars came knocking That’s
the primal biological urge right
to spread your genes These are the
thoughts that run through your head
when your Facebook status changes
to Last Man on Earth

ON JACK behind him TWO SILHOUETTES HOLDING SHOTGUNS in
the cabin window behind them the silhouettes of THREE GIRLS

JACK (VO)(CONT’D)
Actually there’s three of us And
three girls And the same full moon
that was hanging around a month
ago the night it all began

PUSH IN on the MOONthen PULL BACK and TILT DOWN ON
EXT HADLEYVILLE VARIOUS - NIGHT
Big townsmall city in the foothills of some mountains

JACK (VO)
Hadleyville An average American
town There’s some decent ski runs
on Mount Hadleythe Hadley River
runs through town under an old iron
bridgethere’s a national guard
camp and a high school named after
astronaut Buzz Aldrin

Ending on a SHOT OF BUZZ ALDRIN HIGH SCHOOL

JACK (VO)(CONT’D)
Tonight the bros and hos at the top
of the Aldrin social structure were
kicking it at a house party

INT SUBURBAN BACKYARD - NIGHT

The house throbs with music as high schoolers drink smoke
grind hookup ornone of the above ON THREE GEEKS

BURTON BORON (manic brainiac with complex braces producing a
profound sibilance) WHITMAN CROSBY (sensitive hippie kid)
JACK PFLUGER (funny and funny-looking) - sociosexual outcasts

BORON
I dont know why any sentient being
would define this as “a good time”
I mean they’re just standing
around babbling like they do at
school but with music

JACK
And alcohol And hooking up

WHITMAN
Yeah I tried to use the bathroom
and Zack Hobel and Amy Finn are
making twins in there

JACK
It’s like I know I’m the only one
not getting any vag you don’t have
to rub my nose in it

WHITMAN
You can rub my nose in it
BORON
Coming to this party was a fatal
error

JACK
You ungrateful douche You begged
me to beg my brother to let us
come I had to promise to clean and
service his bong for a year

BORON
You should check my calculations
retard that’s the scientific
method The result is a total fail

WHITMAN
It’s like we have the superpower to
remain totally unnoticed

JACK
Well what did you think was going
to happen Everybody stops dancing
and says “Wow those badass sci-fi
club kids are here Let’s give ‘em
high fives and blowjobs”

BORON
They despise us because were
brilliant

JACK
They despise you because you
discovered fungus in the astroturf
and got Homecoming cancelled I
don’t know about you guys but I
only got 2340 on my SAT’s Ive
still got a shot at being human
Sitting around talking to each
other and drinking a lite beer
apiece is junior high bullshit I
say none of us leaves this party
until each of us has successfully
conversed with at least one female

WHITMAN
I say I have the complete second
season of Berserker Odyssey at my
house with director commentary

JACK
Whit fight the darkness Look
Ashley just walked in The girl of
your sick degraded dreams dude

ASHLEY BIEDERMEYER floats in attended by lesser hotties

WHITMAN
My dreams aren’t degrading I mean
she starts out as an alien slave
girl but she earns her freedom

JACK
Whatever She’s here In all eleven
dimensions dude Talk to her

WHITMAN
I can’t She’s too tasty-fine

JACK
She is hot to the nth And the
legend is she gives mint jobs

WHITMAN
Whats a mint job

JACK
A girl chews a whole box of winter-
mint Altoids and gives you a
blowjob and when you’re about to
come she opens her mouth and sucks
in cold air and whooshyour cock
freaks out

WHITMAN
Whoa

BORON
There’s footage of a guy doing it
to himself on Youtube but I think
it lacks the element of surprise

JACK
Check it B-ron The star of your
whack-off fantasies is on the red
carpet And the award for Best
MegaBitch goes to

FLURRY OF SQUEALS and air-kisses heralds the arrival of
MACKENZIE GOLD Dragon Queen of the Drama Dept

Boron attempts a cool-casual pose Looks palsied Notices the
Diet Coke can in his hand Ditches it picks up an unattended
tumbler of liquor Downs a mouthful tries to look cool

So just as Mackenzie passes he CHOKES and SPIT-TAKES THROUGH
HIS BRACES creating a complex Dancing Waters-like fountain
JACK (CONTD)
Smooth

BORON
I don’t see you spending any face
time with your fantasy fuck Where
is Emily anyway

Jack points EMILY MARINO is a pretty girl with major drive

BORON (CONT’D)
OK Initiateinterfacehookup

JACK
Emily is not an easy hookup
Straight A’s I can deal with but
she’s president of five clubs
she’s diving champbesides she
never hooks up with anybody

BORON
Because she’s a lesbian
JACK
She’s not a lesbian She’s
selective
WHITMAN

She’s a virgin goddess

JACK
I tried to grind on her at a Cancer
Dance and she’s like “No thanks
I already do enough charity work”

BORON
She’s a painmistress

WHITMAN

If they trash you at least they
know you exist dude

As the nerds move off ZOOM on MACKENZIE Smiles an evil
smile Starts whispering to Ashley and Emily
INT BACK YARD MINUTES LATER

Partiers hookup on every piece of lawn furniture Boron Jack
and Whitman sit on stone planter watching Pause
WHITMAN
Soyou decide on your project for
Intel Science Talent Search

BORON
Algorithmic dark matter oscillator
The only problem is if it works
it might stop time

JACK
Fucking fine with me

BORON
Copy that I am majorly fucstrated

WHITMAN
“Fucstrated”

JACK
As in “If you don’t fucceed at
fucking you’1ll be fucstrated And
youll never know the sweet smell
of fuccess”

ASHLEY (0C)
Heywhat star is that

CROSSING THE YARD Ashley and Mackenzie have paused to look
up in wonder at the night sky

ASHLEY (CONTD)
The sparkly kind of orangey one

WHITMAN
That’s Aldeberan

BORON
Type K star low metal content
That’s why it’s orange

MACKENZIE
So you’re the really smart one

BORON
Not in all fields but in most
yes With my new 14-incher I can
see Jupiter’s rings

MACKENZIE
Fourteen incher I’d like to see
that

Everybody laughs
ASHLEY
Y’know we should spend more time
with guys who are are interested in
like planets and shit

JACK
Planets Really

ASHLEY
Yeah like space ships and
Chewbacca and shit

BORON
Killer Even though you have your
astronomy confused with a popular
movie franchise I can tell your
heart’s in the right place

EMILY walks by carrying towels

EMILY
Guys are we doing this

MACKENZIE
We’re talking to the geniuses

EMILY
Bring ‘em

And she vanishes AROUND A HEDGE leading to the next yard

MACKENZIE
You guys want to come hang next
door where it’s quieter

JACK
Who lives next door

MACKENZIE
Who cares I just know they’re out
of town and they’ve got a hot tub
If you’re down c’mon

Ashley follows Mackenzie around the hedge into the next
yard nerds left staring at each other

BORON
Hells yeah We’ll be there my
voluptuous temptress ere leviathan
can swim a league

Jack grabs his collar
JACK
Do not fuck this up by talking like
that

BORON
Okay

JACK
You can think it just don’t say
it

EXT ADJOINING YARD
PITCH DARKthe guys grope their way forward

MACKENZIE (0C)
Over here

ACROSS THE YARD we can dimly make out a HOT TUBswathed in
vapor Mackenzie’s head is just a silhouette

MACKENZIE (CONTD)
Hang your clothes on the bush

A BUSH dangles TOWELS and GIRL’S CLOTHES Whitman stares at a
thong awed Jack’s out of his pants Boron tosses his
underwear over the face of a garden gnome

BORON
You don’t need to see what we’re
about to do This party pwns

Naked the geeks go to THE TUB the girls’ heads are
silhouetted in steam The boys slip into the hot tub

JACK
‘Sup ladies

MACKENZIE WHISTLES DEAFENINGLY Blinding FLOODLIGHTS come on
The nerds realize 1 THE GIRLS AREN’T IN THE HOT TUB but
crouching behind the rim 2 The GIRLS ARE FULLY CLOTHED And
3 DOZENS OF KIDS FROM THE PARTY have surrounded the tub
including Mackenzie’s dumb bro-toy BRENT He POINTS

BRENT
Check it bros FLOATER

Horrified the NERDS ROCKET from the tub clutching their
genitals and RUN A GAUNTLET of jeering peers

Mackenzie and Ashley laugh Emily shakes her head in disgust
INT MALL FOOD COURT - DAY

The three guys sit in silent depression

Beat

JACK
I can’t fucking believe we fell for
that

BORON
Again

JACK
We’ve achieved a new quantum level
of humiliation

BORON
It’s like we’re at the center of a
neutron star and one teaspoon of
our humiliation weighs a hundred
thousand pounds

WHITMAN
This is worse than when they told
us Shatner was in that bathroom
stall at the movies signing auto-
graphs How could we not see that

BORON
What’s really counter-fucking-
intuitive is the worse they treat
us the more we want them

WHITMAN
Know what I think I think maybe
by fucking with us they’re really
saying they want to fuck us

JACK
Know what I think I think you put
the idiot in idiot savant

Pause Boron is intense yet distant

BORON
I thinkI have lived too long
among the shadow people I think
this is the struggle of knowledge
against ignorance I think I need
to pass on my DNA somewhere other
than a copy of Maxim

(MORE )

BORON (CONTD)

Copulating barbarians relentlessly
squirt their sperm into every girl
they meetand the last best
chance humanity has of evolutionary
progress is congealing in a boot by
my bed

Pause

JACK
You beat it into a boot

BORON
Fur-lined I stole it from that hot
babysitter I used to have

JACK
Wow I was gonna say that’s
disgusting but can I borrow it

BORON
No I need some Coldstone

He gets up and exits frame Pause

WHITMAN
This gets better when we go to
college right

JACK
No Because by the time we get to
college we’ll be socially retarded
Face it girls are going to hate us
until we get rich And even then
they’1ll be faking it

INT COLDSTONE CREAMERY - MOMENTS LATER
Boron watches the COUNTERGIRL mix fixings into his ice cream

BORON
UmI think if you alternated
horizontal and vertical foldings
you’d get a more even distribution
of gummi bears

COUNTERGIRL
You know Im not listening right

BORON
Im completely cognizant of that I
just have to be careful about
getting stuff caught in these

He displays his incredibly complex braces

BORON (CONTD)
I have hypertrophic trilateral
infundation They have to move my
teeth in six different directions
or my canines will grow into my
brain

BEHIND HIM IN LINE Jack and Whitman

WHITMAN
I got banned from World of Warcraft

JACK
I tried to play last night but the
server was crashed That was you

WHITMAN
I created a Reconciliation Virus
It was pretty amazingall these
gnolls singing folk songs orcs
picking flowers but then the
fascist admin drops the banhammer
and declares me a Peace Terrorist

INT MALL COUNCOURSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eating ice cream the trio looks out over three levels of
stores and shoppers lots of teens many in pairs

BORON
Float me a hypothesis Why do smart
guys fail with women

JACK

The real question is why are
idiots so good with women

(points)
See Meeker fingering Mimi on that
bench He’s working her like a
ventrilquist’s dummy Guy’s gonna
be in summer school til he’s like
forty and he’s up to his elbows in
vag

WHITMAN
Chris Twilley ate paste until he
was a sophomore and he’s gotten
like five girls pregnant
BORON
Women are attracted to physical
traits that only make sense in the
hunter-gatherer past

JACK
That’s why violent stylin’ idiots
get VIP backstage access to pussy
The only way these girls would fuck
us is if we were the last men on
earth

BORON
This isn’t how evolution is
supposed to work Why do our
genetic inferiors do all the
reproducing Look at them It’s the
blind fucking the blind Hot idiot-
on-idiot action They don’t deserve
sex They deserve to work in mines
as slaves to superior intellects
“That one pleases me Have her
hosed off and brought to my
pleasure pod” FUCK ME

He walks away Long pause

INT

JACK
Remember our deal if he suggests
shooting up the school to either of
us we tell the other one right

WHITMAN
Fo sho

CLASSROOM DAY

CUT TO

Jack is standing in front of his class reading a paper

JACK
“the Scarlet Letter is a
desperate cry of unrequited human
desire and a grim warning of the
hideous lengths to which men will
go in the pursuit of an unholy
passion”

ENGLISH TEACHER
Superb I’m sure we all enjoyed
hearing what an A sounds like

Jack returns to his seat classmates throw him dirty looks
MACKENZIE
I’m sure we all enjoyed watching
you take a bath with a floater

BRENT
Faggotcock

JACK

INT BORON BASEMENT - NIGHT

Nerd HQ a deskful of computers a mini-fridge a circle of
recliners Lining the walls tropical terrariums home to a
HUNDRED SNAKES The only light is the RED GLOW of heat lamps
Boron is shirtless an emerald boa twined around his torso
BORON

They say the human aversion to
snakes is hardwired from back in
the arboreal primate day but I
think they’re beautiful

(pause)
Premise Mackenzie Ashley and
Emily wouldn’t sleep with us unless
we were the last men on earth

JACK
Fuck are we gonna do this again

BORON
I wouldn’t waste your time on
Battlestar Galactica night
Pfluger

JACK
OK I stipulate to your assumption
these girls wouldn’t introduce
themselves to our dicks unless they
were the last three dicks on earth

BORON
But what if we were What if we
really were the last men on earth

JACK
You have been fooling around with
anthrax It’s a nice idea dude
but did you think about the cost

BORON
I’m not talking about planetwide
genocide -- yet -- I’m talking

about what if they thought we were
the last men on earth You saw War
of the Worlds right

WHITMAN
The Tom Cruise is an Alien movie

JACK
Tom Cruise fights the aliens bro
Cause they invade Earth remember

WHITMAN
Whoa I majorly misinterpreted that
plot

BORON
The point is the first time that
story was broadcast was on radio
back in the day October 30 1938

WHITMAN
(calculating)
Which was aSunday

Boron clicks FADE UP the unmistakable voice of Orson Welles

30S RADIO REPORTER (WELLES)
---Mt Jennings Observatory reports
explosions on the planet Mars Now
a special bulletin a huge flaming
object believed to be a meteorite
has fallen on a farm in Grovers
Mill New Jersey

BORON
Ten minutes later it’s total war

30S RADIO REPORTER 2
it’s rising out of the metallic
cylindergoing higher and higher
Its -- its standing on three
legs reaching above the trees

30S RADIO REPORTER 3
7000 men pitted against a single
fighting machine of the invaders
from Mars a hundred and twenty
survivors the rest strewn over the
battle field trampled under the
metal feet of the monster or
burned to cinders by its heat ray--

JACK
This is already better than
“Cloverfield”

30S RADIO REPORTER 4
Advancing at express-train speed
the invaders uproot power lines
bridges and railroad tracks Their
objective to crush resistance
paralyze communication and
disorganize human society

(EXPLOSION STATIC)

As I set down these notes I am
obsessed by the thought that I may
be the last living man on earth

WHITMAN
And people thought this shit was
really happening

BORON
(reading from screen)
“The broadcast created a panic in
central New Jersey as residents
fled the area”

JACK
“When a town in Washington State
experienced a transformer explosion
and blackout during the broadcast
citizens fainted fled and fired
guns at low-flying aircraft”

WHITMAN
“When an Ecuadoran radio station
broadcast a Spanish version a riot
resulted in the burning of the
station and ten deaths” Whoa

BORON
You isolate the girls -- like at
my Uncle’s cabin -- control their

imputs phone net TV radio

JACK
once you got past telling them
their families were dead yeah
youd be into that post-apocalyptic

pussy

WHITMAN
End-of-the-world sex Too bad it’s
only a dream
(belches )
Let’s book to my place In the next
ep of Berserker Odyssey the
Valkyries get naked

BORON
Hold up Why couldn’t we do it

JACK
Cause it’s tough to get into
college with a felony on your
transcript Baby Einstein

WHITMAN
Yeah it’s a lot safer to drown our
sorrows in wenches and mead
Pause

BORON
FUCK BESERKER ODYSSEY Fuck
imaginary worlds and fur thongs We
could do this Real world And
catch no shit at all

WHITMAN
Becausethe ladies will fall in
love with us and they won’t want
to report us

BORON
Nice try Whit They won’t report
us because they’1ll be so fucking
embarrassed they’d spontaneously
combust Think about it

JACK
It wouldn’t be cheap

BORON
No worries I pulled my bar mitzvah
bank out of the market in ’08 and
went short on GM

WHITMAN
Butif it was a fail

JACK
The public humiliation would be
fucking exponential It would be a
suicide situation

BORON
Agreed But if it worked they’d be
too embarrassed to rat us out

JACK
Humiliation would finally be our
friend

BORON
Affirmative Because we carry the
stench of the uncool The musk of
the misfit Well I say we embrace
our geek heritage That’s right
we’‘re chicken head biters Rat
eaters We’re guys who do shit that
isunthinkable
