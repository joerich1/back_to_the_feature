A WORD ABOUT THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF THIS SCRIPT

Many people tend to use terms like universe and cosmos and galaxy
rather loosely This script will remain true to the STAR TREK trad-
ition of scientific reality With a few possible exceptions the STAR
TREK series and films take place within our own galaxy The galaxy is
vast but finite (as opposed to the universe which is infinite) As
Gene Roddenberry has pointed out ony 115 of this galaxy will have
been explored by the 23rd Century

Because the galaxy is finite however it has a center It is unlikely
that by the time of this tale this central are distant and dangerous
will have been explored Nor can anyone say for sure what we may find
there

These basic assumptions evolve from our on-going discussions with the
staff of IPAC (Infrared Processing and Analysis Center) of JPLCal
Tech Their incredible computer graphics obtained by advanced infra-
red satellite telescope photography will be made available to use to
enhance not only the accuracy but the incredible beauty of this
latest STAR TREK voyage

FADE IN
EXT DESERT - DAY 1

Shimmering waves of heat A flat unforgiving landscape
stretches to infinity A storm of dust gathers on the
horizon small at first increasing in size as it
rolls toward us Hoofbeats fill the soundtrack Just
as the storm threatens to engulf us A RIDER ON
HORSEBACK emerges

Superimpose NIMBUS III
IN THE NEUTRAL ZONE
(THE PLANET OF GALACTIC PEACE )

CLOSER ANGLE - STRANGE HORSE AND RIDER 2

A twisted rhino horn juts from the snout of this odd
creature The Rider spurs the beast driving it onward
His white robes flare out behind him like the wings

of an avenging angel He rides like a man possessed

CUT TO
EXT DRY LAKE BED - DAY 3
Camera pans an arid expanse of scorched earth JONN
a ragged and malnourished homesteader of some alien
race toils beneath a blazing sun his back to camera
He sinks an augering device into the ground drilling
in vain for water There are many hundreds
of holes in the earth around him
Jonn reacts to the clop of approaching hooves He
tenses then whirls around clutching a crude home-made
pipe gun
JONNS POV 4
Horse and rider thunder toward him
ANGLE 5

Jonn raises his pipe gun and fires a warning shot
The Rider reins his horse to a halt ten feet short
of Jonn The beast snorts and stamps its hooves

impatiently while the Rider studies the frightened
homesteader and removes a breathing device from his
mouth Finally he speaks

RIDER
I thought weapons were forbiddeen on
this planet

The Rider swings down from the saddle Hes tall power-
fully built beneath his dusty robs his face shadowed by
a hood He indicates their bleak surroundings

RIDER
(continuing)
Besides I cant believe youd kill
me for a field of empty holes

JONN
(pathetic)
Its all I have

Jonn sags under the futile weight of his existence
The Rider approaches him without fear He gently
removes the weapon from Jonns trembling hands Its
all the homesteader can do to keep from sobbing

RIDER
Your pain runs deep

JONN
(turns away in
embarrassment )
What do you know of my pain

RIDER
Let us explore it together

The Rider collects himself and concentrates deeply
Jonn is immediately transfixed He begins to tremble
Tears flood his dirty cheeks

RIDER

(continuing soothing

tone)
Each man hides a secret pain It must
be exposed and reckoned with It must
be hauled from the darkness and
forced into the light Share your
pain with me and gain strength from
it

Jonn whimpers and cries out in anguish Finally the
catharis ends Jonn drops to his knees then looks up
He opens his eyes and blinks in wonder and amazement
at the Rider The Rider helps him to his feet

JONN
(as if reborn)
Where did you get this power

RIDER
The power was within you

JONN
(trying to find
the words)
I feel as if a weight has been lifted
from my heart How can I repay you
for this miracle

RIDER
Join my quest

JONN
What is it you seek

RIDER
What you seek What all men have
sought since time began -- the

ultimate knowledge To find it well
need a starship

JONN
A starship There are no starships on
Nimbus III

RIDER

Perhaps I have a way to bring one here
JONN

But how
RIDER

Have faith my friend There are more
of us than you know

CLOSER ON THE RIDER

as he throws back his hood to reveal rugged charismatic
features Hes bearded his hair is shaggy He has the
piercing eyes of a zealot and to our surprise pointed
ears His name is SYBOK

JONN
(OS amazed)
Youre a Vulcan

Sybok nods and does something weve never seen a Vulcan
do He smiles And as he does the first faint bars of
the Star Trek Theme well up on the soundtrack

LONG SHOT 7

The Vulcan his convert and the horse are tiny figures
in a overpoweringly bleak landscape Camera tilts up
through waves of heat to the blazing sky and the galaxy
beyond

SLOW FADE TO
SPACE 8

Music and credits play over a dazzling journey through
the cosmos Planets stars and solar systems flash by
No doubt about it Were in for a rousing Star Trek
adventure As the final credits appear we tilt down
to a breathtaking shot of Earth

CUT TO
EXT YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK —- DAY 9
CLOSE UP - A HAND

as it clutches a sheer rock groping for purchase
Camera pulls back to reveal CAPTAIN JAMES T KIRK
eight hundred feet above the surrounding forest He
climbs the face of El Capitan without ropes gromets
or equipment Just man against mountain Using the
cracks in the rock face for hand and foot holds Jim
Kirk struggles up the treacherous incline one
painful inch at a time We hold our breath afraid
hell fall

CAMPSITE BELOW

DR LEONARD BONES McCOY watches Kirks progress
through futuristic binoculars with mounting unease
From this distance Kirk resembles a small fly ona
big wall

McCOY

(muttering toward the

mountian)
Youll have a great time Bones
Youll enjoy your leave and be able
to relax

(lowering binoculars)
You call this relaxing Im a damn
nervous wreck

(a beat)
If Im not careful Ill end up talk-
ing to myself

EL CAPITAN - KIRK

He inserts the pads of two fingers into a narrow crack
above his head He exhales focusing concentration
Kirk pulls himself up balancing on a ledge barely an
inch wide Exhilarated he pauses to admire the view

KIRKS POV

A breathtaking but vertigo-inducing high angle shot of
Yosemite This may be the 23rd Century but the park
looks the same as it did three hundred years ago There
is a soft whooshing sound and SPOCK suddenly rises into
frame

SPOCK
Greetings Captain

WIDE SHOT
Spock hovers in mid-air along side the startled Kirk
kept aloft by means of levitation boots His hands
are clasped behind his back typically Spock-like
KIRK
Spock -- what brings you to this neck

of the woods

SPOCK

I have been monitoring your progress

KIRK
Im flattered Twelve hundred points
of interest in Yosemite and you pick
me

Spock doesnt take Kirks hint to get lost

SPOCK
I regret to inform you that the record
time for free-climbing El Capitan is
in no danger of being broken

KIRK
(as he climbs)
Im not trying to break any records
Spock Im doing this because I
enjoy it Not to mention the lost
important reason for climbing a
mountain

SPOCK
Which is

KIRK
(with a smile)
Because its there

SPOCK
Captain I do not think you realize
the gravity of your situation

Kirk slips but manages to gain a handhold and save
himself Beneath his feet a mini-avalanche of rocks
is dislodged tumbling to the valley below

KIRK
(glaring at Spock)
On the contrary Gravity is foremost
on my mind Spock Look Im trying
to make an ascent here Why dont
you go pester Dr McCoy for a while

SPOCK
Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods

14 CAMPSITE BELOW

McCoy still watching Kirks progress is getting an-
grier by the second

McCOY
(grumbling)
Goddamn Irresponsible Playing
games with life
EL CAPITAN - KIRK AND SPOCK
Kirk strains for the next handhold
SPOCK
Concentration is vital You must be
one with the mountain
KIRK
Spock I appreciate your concern but
if you dont stop distracting me
Im liable to be one with the
CAMPSITE

McCoy lets out a gasp as he watches Kirks tiny figure
drop down the face of El Cap

ANGLE - SPOCK

He dives after Kirk firing boosters to increase his
speed

ANGLE - KIRK

Twisting and turning end over end as he hurtles down-
ward He thrashes at air unable to defeat gravity

CAMPSITE
McCoy turns away unable to watch
ANGLE - KIRK

Dropping dropping the ground rushing up like a
hungry mouth A split-second before impact

ANGLE - SPOCK

The Vulcan swoops into shot His powerful fingers grab
Kirk by the ankle and jerk him upward in the nick of

time
CAMPSITE

McCoy hasnt heard the expected splat He turns to
look and what he sees is

WIDE SHOT

Kirk is supended in air bobbing upside down at the
end of Spocks arm

CLOSER - KIRK AND SPOCK
The top of Kirks head is practically touching the
ground Thats how close he came to being pizza Kirk
blinks in disbelief
SPOCK

Perhaps because it is there is not

a sufficient reason for wanting to

climb a mountain

Kirk dangles -- undignified but lucky to be alive

KIRK
Im hardly in a position to disagree

McCoy is heard in approach
KIRKS POV

McCoy is seen upside down

KIRK
Hello Bones Mind if we drop in for
dinner

McCOY

Thats right turn it into a big joke
Dammit Jim are you that anxious to
meet your maker

EXT NIMBUS III - DESERT - DAY

Sybok and his mount ride majestically to the top of a
dune and halt They are followed by Jonn Hes on

CUT TO

foot but he clambers over the dune with determination
Behind Jonn comes another tattered homesteader And
behind him two more Without warning a virtual army
of ragged settlers swarm over the dune They fill the
screen aliens of every different race the poor and
downtrodden -- united in their devotion to Sybok

ANGLE - SYBOK

His army draws up beside him dust rising Sybok points
into the blurry middle distance

SYBOK
My friends behold Paradise

Camera pans off Sybok Below them sprawls the single
outpost of civilization on this desolate world -- a
small ramshackle village smack in the middle of no-
where surrounded by high walls A lone rider on
horseback crosses the desert headed for the outpost

CLOSER SHOT - MAIN GATE

Across the top of the arch broken letters spell out
Paradise Some cynical jiker has added the word
Lost The lone rider signals the lookout sentries
who open the heavy iron gate Camera cranes up over
the arch as the rider passes beneath and rides toward
the sleazy-looking saloon at the far end of the street

INT PARADISE CITY SALOON - DAY

A 23rd Century equivalent of a frontier saloon Fut-
uristic honky tonk music The patrons are rugged
unpleasant types Klingons Romulans Andorians you
name it Much drink and boistrous talk Arguments
Fistfights Two men play futuristic pool on a table
filled with water

A SEXY CATWOMAN dances atop the bar flicking her
long striped tail and hissing seductively at her
rowdy audience

ANGLE ON SALOON DOOR

A STRANGER coming from outside approaching familiar
western-style doors But instead of swinging open

CUT TO

like youd expect they whoosh apart automatically
The stranger steps into the bar and the doors whoosh
back into place

WIDE SHOT

Talk and noise go dead as the entire saloon turns its
attention to the newcomer The stranger seen only
from the back steps into the squalid bar The Bar-
tender jerks his thumb in the direction of the back
room The stranger crosses to the back room door and
dissapears inside Talk and noise resume

INT BACK ROOM

The stranger lowers the breathing device from her face
and is revealed to be a young woman A Romulan Her
name is CAITHLIN DAR and she stands on the threshold
of the room trying to adjust her eyes to the murky
surroundings Shes a little nervous and a long way
from home

The back room is an area for unwanted odds and ends A
ceiling fan swishes overhead pushing hot air around
TWO MEN are sprawled in chairs at opposite ends of a
table Theyre too busy drinking to notice Caithlins
entrance

CAITHLIN
Gentlemen Im Caithlin Dar

The man seated closest to Caithlin slowly swivels his
head in her direction He wearily extracts himself
from his chair and comes forward Hes a Terran (spec-—
ifically an Englishman) named ST JOHN TALBOT Thin
and dissipated alcoholic Talbot is a veteran of the
diplomatic corps He pats down his unruly hair and
straightens his soiled suit He gives Caithlin a tired
smile and extends a limp hand

TALBOT
Ah yes Our new Romulan represent-—
ative Welcome to Paradise City Miss
Dar capital of the so-called Planet
of Galactic Peace Im St John
Talbot the Federation representative
here on Nimbus III and my charming
companion is the Klingon consul
Korrd

Caithlin regards the hulking figure on the other end

of the table KORRD is an old overweight Klingon
once great warrior now past his prime He doesnt

a

rise to greet Caithlin Instead he takes a swig from

a flagon and emits an earth-shaking belch

CAITHLIN
I expect thats Klingon for hello

Reacting to Korrds stench Caithlin holds her breathing

device in front of her mouth

TALBOT
He doesnt speak English

CAITHLIN
And I dont speak Klingon

TALBOT

Im relieved to hear that Please sit

down Miss Dar Can I offer you a
drink

Caithlin brushes the dust from a chair at the opposite

end of the table from Korrd

CAITHLIN
(boldly)
I must say Im shocked at what Ive

seen Hunger Poverty No law enforce-

ment And here the two of you sit
drinking

Without warning Korrd drunkenly lets loose with a
barrage of his native tongue (It is subtitled in

English for those who dont speak Klingon )

KORRD

(Romulan woman belong on their backs)

CAITHLIN
What did he say

TALBOT
He says he hopes youll enjoy your

tour of duty here Might I ask Miss

Dar what terrible thing you did to

get yourself banished to this armpit
of the galaxy

CAITHLIN
I volunteered

TALBOT
(spewing grog)
Volunteered

Talbot turns to Korrd and translates her answer
Klingon Korrd chortles derisively

CAITHLIN
Nimbus III is a great experiment
Twenty years ago when our three
governments agreed to develop this
planet together a new age was born

TALBOT

Your new age died a quick death The
great drought put an end to it And
the settlers we conned into coming
here -- the dregs of the galaxy
They immediately took to fighting
amongst themselves We forbade them
weapons -- they fashioned their own

CAITHLIN
Then it appears Ive arrived just in
time The policies that the three of
us agree on will have far-reaching
results

TALBOT
My dear girl were not here to agree
Were here to disagree This great
experiment as you call it was
instigated to satisfy a bunch of
bleeding hearts whining for galactic

peace It was intended to fail
CAITHLIN
Im afraid I dont share that view
TALBOT
(pleased)

There you see We are disagreeing
already

into
CAITHLIN
Im here to open discussions for a
solution to these problems

Korrd comes to life He roars with laughter and spits
back a disgusting mouthful of Klingon Talbot winces

CAITHLIN
(losing patience)
What did he say I want his exact
words

TALBOT
He said the only thing hed like to
open is your blouse Hes heard
Romulan women are different

Caithlins embarrassment turns to anger

CAITHLIN
You tell Consul Korrd -- never mind
Ill tell him myself in the only
Klingon I know

Caithlin lets loose with a Klingon epithet No trans-
lation necessary Sputtering with rage Korrd hurls
his flagon aside and clambers to his feet

KORRD
(in perfect English)
Screw you too

CAITHLIN
He does speak English

TALBOT
(surprised)
Sly old bugger

Further argument is interrupted by shouts from outside
and the whine of a warning klaxon

A handful of sentries brace themselves against the gate
It suddenly gives way Camera climbs up over the top

of the arch to reveal Syboks army on the threshold

of the city In their midst towering majestically
above them is Sybok on horseback He urges his mount
forward With quiet determination he and his army pour
under the arch and proceed up the main drag

Townspeople scurrying for protection anticipating an
attack Those who consider challenging Sybok are
allayed by the crude weapons and intimidating looks
of his followers Sybok intends to take this town by
show of force without having to fire a shot And it
looks like hell succeed

OMITTED
EXT STREET OUTSIDE SALOON

Korrd Caithlin and Talbot emerge to see what the hub-
bub is about When they see the approaching forces
Korrd and Talbot immediately turn tail and run back
inside After a moment Caithlin follows

INT SALOON

Korrd fearing the worst goes behind the bar and
opens a bottle He upends it and pours the contents
down his throat He prefers to die drunk

Talbot runs to the far side of the room and yanks a
dusty sheet off a primitive communications screen
Caithlin rushes to his side as he desperately tries
to get it working

The saloon doors are forced open Jonn and several
soldiers pour in brandishing weapons

JONN
Get away from that screen

The klaxon winds down to eerie silence as the soldiers
herd Korrd Caithlin and Talbot together Sybok enters

SYBOK
(appraising them
one by one)
Romulan Terran Klingon Consider
yourselves my prisoners

TALBOT
(scoffing)
Prisoners Were already prisoners on
this worthless ball of rock Of what
possible value could we be to you

SYBOK
Nimbus III may be a wonderous ball of
rock but it does have one unique
treasure Its the only place in the
entire galaxy that has the three of
you

Korrd reaches for the pistol at his side But before
his fingers can grasp it Syboks soldiers noisily

cock their weapons and point them at his heart Korrd
is outgunned and he knows it He sputters impotently

CAITHLIN
(to Sybok boldly)
I dont know who you are or what you
want but I can tell you this our
government will stop at nothing to
insure our safety

SYBOK
(with a smile)
Thats exactly what Im counting on

On Caithlins confused look

EXT SPACE - THE EARTH - SPACEDOCK

Hanging in space like a big Christams ornament The
big blue marble called Earth is visible in the
distance

INT SPACEDOCK

A huge cavernous area designed as a high and dry for
space vessels Among this warehouse of ships is the
one we know best -- USS ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-A

INT ENTERPRISE BRIDGE

A meager repair crew lazily overhauls consoles and
monitors Some things work most do not One thing
that does work is CHIEF ENGINEER MONTGOMERY SCOTT
who looks up as COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER UHURA enters
stepping around cables

SCOTTY
(grumbling to himself)

CUT TO

Lets see what shes got the Captain
said And then we found out didnt
we

UHURA
Im sure youll whip her into shape
Scotty You always do

SCOTTY
(realizing)
Uhura why arent you on leave

UHURA
I thought we were going together
SCOTTY
(indicating the
ship)
I canna leave her when she needs me
the most
UHURA

I had a feeling youd say something
like that So

(produces a food

pack)
I brought you some dinner

SCOTTY
(touched)
Lass youre the most understanding
woman I know

The Bridge light starts to flash red An ear-splitting
klaxon sounds

COMPUTER VOICE
Red alert Red alert

SCOTTY
(exasperated)
I just fixed that damn thing Turn
it off will you

Uhura goes to her console to switch it off but sees
something odd She punches a button and responds

UHURA
This is Enterprise Identify your-

self

COMMAND VOICE
Enterprise this is Starfleet We
have a Priority Seven situation in
the Neutral Zone

UHURA
Stand by Starfleet
(signalig Scotty)
Scotty its for real

SCOTTY
(aghast)
You canna be serious The ships in
pieces and weve less than a
skeleton crew on board

UHURA
Starfleet are you aware of our current
status

COMMAND VOICE
Current status understood Stand by to
copy operational orders and recall key
personnel

Uhura and Scotty share grim looks

EXT EARTH - FOREST - DAY

COMMANDER SULU and CHEKOV tramp through dense woods
From their weary expressions its clear theyve been
hiking a long time Sulu leads the way Chekov
trudges behind him

CHEKOV
Admit it Were lost

SULU
All right were lost
(with a smile)
But were making good time
Sulus communicator beeps

SULU

CUT TO

I dont believe this
(flips it out)
Commander Sulu here

INTERCUT WITH
INT ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

Uhura studies a monitor showing Sulu and Chekov as two
blips on a grid

UHURA
Commander Sulu this is Enterprise
Bad news gentlemen Shore leaves
been cancelled

CHEKOV
(with relief)
Rescued at last

UHURA
Return to the prearranged coordin-
ates for pickup

Sulu and Chekov look at each other

CHEKOV
(whispering)
Dont tell her youre lost Youll
never live it down

UHURA
Is there a problem gentlemen
SULU
Er yes Weve been caught in a
blizzard
CHEKOV

(playing along)
And we cant see a thing Request
you direct us to the co-ordinates

Chekov provides blizzard noises
On Enterprise Uhura listens to the blizzard and

checks her graphics display for weather report She
smiles
UHURA
Im sorry about your weather My
visual says sunny skies and seventy
degrees

CHEKOV
(improvising)
Sulu Look The suns come out Its
a miracle

UHURA
(chuckling)
Dont worry fellas Your secrets
safe with me Ill send the shuttle-
craft to pick you up

SULU
Uhura we owe you one Sulu out

Sulu and Chekov sit down on a boulder to wait

SULU
(continuing)
I should have gone to Yosemite with
the Captain

CHEKOV
Whats the difference If youve
seen one national park youve seen
them all

Camera tilts up to reveal Mt Rushmore in the back-
ground We pan the granite faces of Washington
Jefferson Roosevelt Lincoln and -- surprise -- the
face of a fifth president (who happens to be a woman
A black woman )

EXT YOSEMITE - CAMPSITE- NIGHT 42
McCoy stands over a blazing campfire A covered pot
simmers on the coals McCoy picks up a pan and bangs
on it with a spoon Hes slightly tipsy
McCOY

(calling out)
Come and get it
Camera pulls back to reveal Kirk and Spock two feet
away

KIRK
Knock it off Bones Were right here
and were starving

McCoy grins and crouches beside the covered pot He
revels in their undivided attention

SPOCK
Bi-podal seeds Doctor
McCOY
Beans Spock -- but no ordinary beans

These are from an old Southern recipe
handed down to me by my father And
if you turn your Vulcan nose at
these youre not just insulting me
youre insulting countless gener-
ations of McCoys

SPOCK
In that case I have little choice
but to sample your beans

McCoy ladles out the beans Kirk tears into his Spock
tries a forkful He finds the taste strangely exciting

SPOCK
Surprisingly good However it contains
a flavoring I am not familiar with

McCOY
Thats the secret ingredient

Spock eats with enthusiasm

KIRK
Got any more of that secret ingredient
Bones

McCOY

You bet your buns

McCoy grins and pulls out a bottle of bourbon Spock
stops in mid-chew and McCoy fills Kirks cup

SPOCK
Am I to understand that your secret
ingredient is alcohol

McCOY
Bourbon Spock Kentucky bourbon
Care for a snort

KIRK
Bourbon and beans An explosive combin-
ation Do you think Spock can handle
it

McCOY
Couldnt possibly affect his Vulcan
metabolism

SPOCK
As you are so fond of pointing out
Doctor I am half human

McCOY
Certainly doesnt show

SPOCK
Thank you

McCOY

This guy never changes I insult him
and he takes it as a compliment
(pouring himself
another shot)
You know the two of you could drive
a man to drink

KIRK
(innocent )
What did I do

McCOY
You really piss me off Jim Human
life is far too precious to risk
on crazy stunts Maybe it didnt
cross your macho mind but when you
fell off that mountain you should
have been killed

KIRK
It crossed my mind
McCOY

And

KIRK
Even as I fell I knew I wouldnt
die

McCOY

(indicating Spock)
I thought he was the only one whos
immortal

KIRK
Its not that Bones I knew I wouldnt
die because the two of you were with

me
SPOCK
I do not understand
KIRK
(darkly)
Ive always known Ill die alone
McCOY
(frowning)
Ill call Valhalla and reserve you a

room

(shaking his head)
Its a mystery that draws us together
All that time in space -- gettin on
each others nerves -- and what do we
do when shore leave comes along
Spend it together Other people have
families

KIRK
(wistful)
Other people Bones Not us

They dwell on this thought for a moment Then Kirk
notices that Spock has removed a sack from his back-
pack Spock reaches into the sack and takes out a
marshmallow which he attaches ot the end of a pointed
stick

KIRK
What are you doing Spock
SPOCK
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon

Marsh melon Kirk and McCoy hide their smiles as Spock
holds the marshmallow over the fire

McCOY
Well Ill be damned A marsh melon
Where did you learn that

SPOCK
Before leaving the ship I consulted
the library computer to familiarize
myself with the customs of camping
out The evening meal is tradition-
ally followed by the toasting of
marsh melons

Spock offers sticks and marshmallows to Kirk and McCoy
who play along amused by Spocks dead serious approach
to frivolity

McCOY
Tell me something Spock What do we
do after we toast the marsh er
melons

SPOCK
We consume them

McCOY
I know we consume them I mean after
that

SPOCK

I believe we are required to engage
in a ritual known as the sing-a-long

KIRK
I havent sung around a campfire since
I was a boy in Iowa What should we
sing Bones

McCOY
(thinking)
How about Camptown Races

KIRK
Pack Up Your Troubles
SPOCK
Are we leaving Captain

McCOY

Its a song title Spock
SPOCK

Ah
KIRK

Moon Over Rigel Seven

McCOY
Row Row Row Your Boat

KIRK
Excellent Do you know it Spock
SPOCK
I did not encounter that song in my
research
KIRK

The lyrics are simple Row row
row your boat gently down the
streammerrilymerrily merrily
merrily life is but a dream
Bones and I will start it off and
when we give you the signal jump
in Doctor if you please

McCoy takes a hit of booze and clears his throat

McCOY
Dont say I didnt warn you

McCoy starts to sing Kirk joins in Maybe its the
bourbon but the two of them sound pretty good

KIRK AND McCOY
(overlapping)
Row row row your boat gently down
the stream merrily merrily merrily
merrily life is but a dream

They signal Spock that its his turn to jump in but
the Vulcan merely regards them quizzically The
sing-a-long grinds to a halt
KIRK
Whats wrong Spock Why didnt you
join in

SPOCK
I was trying to comprehend the mean-
ing of the words

McCOY
(losing patience)
Its a song you green-blooded son of
a Vulcan You sing it The words
arent important Whats important is
that you have a good time singing it

SPOCK
(sincere)
I am sorry Doctor Were we having a
good time

McCOY
(giving up)
I liked him better before he died

McCoy rolls out his sleeping bag

KIRK
Why dont we call it a night and get
some sleep Im anxious to have
another go at El Cap in the morning

McCOY
Over my dead body

They prepare for bed
LONG SHOT - CAMPSITE
Under a twinkling sky the three men settle into their
sleeping bags Faint night sounds Crickets An owl
Then
SPOCK
(toubled)

Captain

KIRK
Were on leave Call me Jim

SPOCK
Jim

KIRK
Yes Spock

SPOCK
Life is not a dream

KIRK
(with a sigh)
Go to sleep Spock

They go to sleep Stars twinlke overhead

EXT SPACE

A NASA Pioneer probe tumbles through space Ancient
forgotten the device is flotsam On its side is a
plaque showing image of two humans and simple mathe-
matical and scientific symbols It comes past camera
and out of this distortion a Klingon Bird of Prey
materializes

INT BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE

Doors seperate to admit KLAA the Bird of Preys
swashbuckling young captain He is met by VIXIS his
first officer a statuesque Klingon female Its
clear she adores Klaa

VIXIS
(Captain Klaa we have a target in
sight A probe of ancient origin)

KLAA
(Difficult to hit)

VIXIS
(Most difficult)

KLAA
(Good )

Klaas crew watches with excitement as their captain
straps himself into his command chair which has been

CUT TO

equipped with an elaborate gunners rig allowing
Klaa to do the shooting himself

KLAA
(All weapons to my control)

A periscope-like device swings into position in front
of Klaas flashing eyes

PERISCOPE - KLAAS POV 46

The probe is a tiny traveling speck in the distance
Its course is erratic

EXT SPACE 47

The probe tumbles through space as the Bird of Prey
swoops down for the attack Machine gun-like phasers
are mounted on the Birds wings They come to life
and swivel blasting a flange off the front of the
probe A second blast destroys a fin on the rear of
the craft A third shot blows away the antennae
Klaa is toying with the target

INT BIRD OF PREY - BRIDGE 48

The crew cheers each hit They admire their captain
and his deadly skill But Klaa seems dissatisfied
He hesitates finishing the probe off

KLAA
(Shooting space garbage is no test of
a warriors mettle I need a target
that fights back)

VIXIS
(Captain we are receiving a priority
message from Operations Command )

There was a young student except-—

intelligence It was assumed that
one day he would take his place
amongst the great scholars of Vulcan
But he was a revolutionary

The knowledge and experience he sought
were forbidden by Vulcan belief

KIRK
Forbidden

SPOCK
He rejected his logical upbringing
and embraced the animal passions of
our ancestors

Why

He believed that the key to self-
knowledge was emotion not logic

Kirk is no match for the Vulcans superior strength
but he fights with everything hes got He manages to
knock the weapon from Syboks hand It skitters
across the floor and stops at the feet of Spock who
has emerged from the shuttle

Spock looks down at the weapon then back to Kirk
whom Sybok is rendering helpless with one hand With
his incredible strength Sybok forces Kirk to the floor

KIRK
(in pain)
Spock pick it up

Spock obediently picks up the weapon like it was a
distastful object Kirk collapses on the floor
conscious but no longer able to fight Sybok faces
Spock

SPOCK
Sybok you must surrender

SYBOK
(approaching Spock)
Spock you cant stun me with that
weapon and Ive always been
stronger than you Im afraid
youll have to kill me

Spock raises the weapon as Sybok advances
KIRK
(desperate)
Spock -- shoot him
But Spock cant shoot The emotional price is too great
He lowers the weapon in shame and defeat Sybok takes
it from him with a smile

For a moment I thought you might
actually do it

What you have done is betray every

SPOCK
Worse I have betrayed you I do
not expect you to forgive me --

KIRK
Forgive you I ought to knock you
on your goddamn ass

SPOCK
If you think that will help

McCOY
You want me to hold him Jim

KIRK
You stay out of this
(to Spock)

Why Spock All you had to do was
pull the trigger

SPOCK
If I had pulled the trigger Sybok
would be dead

KIRK
I ordered you to defend your ship

SPOCK
You ordered me to kill my brother

KIRK
The man may be a fellow Vulcan
but thats no reason --

SPOCK

You did not hear me Captain
Sybok too is a son of Sarek

Kirk and McCoy cant believe it

KIRK
Hes your brother brother
(flustered)
You made that up
SPOCK
I did not
KIRK

Sybok couldnt possibly be your
brother because I know for a fact
that you dont have a brother

SPOCK
Technically you are correct I
do not have a brother

KIRK
You see

SPOCK
I have a half brother

KIRK
(suddenly weary)
I need to sit down

McCOY
Let me get this straight You and
Sybok have the same father but
different mothers

SPOCK
That is correct Syboks mother
was a Vulcan princess After her
death Sybok and I were raised as

brothers

KIRK
But why didnt you tell us this
before

SPOCK

I was not prepared to discuss
matters of a personal nature For

that I am sorry

KIRK
(still fuming)

Hes sorry Well I guess that makes
everything all right doesnt it

Quit it Jim Spock couldnt kill
his brother any more than he

could kill you If you want to
punish him for what hes done why
dont you throw him in the Brig

Consider the questions of existence
Who am I Why am I here Does God
exist These are the questionsd man
has asked ever since he first gazed
at the stars and dreamed My Vulcan
ancestors were ruled by their
emotions They felt with their hearts
made love with their hearts
and believed with their
hearts Above all else they believed
in a place where these questions of
existence would be answered Modern

lect I have ever known

debate Sha Ka Ree until youre
green in the face Until then
youre either with me or youre
not

(as if its obvious)
I am with you

Thats a little vague Spock --

An infrequent almost inaudible tapping sound comes
from the back wall of the cell

KIRK

What is that damn noise

They turn and regard the back wall The tapping continues

KIRK
Spock
(when he doesnt reply
to Sybok)
What have you done to my friends

SYBOK
Ive done nothing This is who they
are didnt you know that

The question hits Kirk with force

KIRK
(realizing)
No I didnt

SYBOK
Now learn something about yourself

KIRK
No I refuse

McCOY
(imploring)
Jim try to be open about this

KIRK
About what Thay Ive made the wrong
choices in my life That I went left
when I shouldve gone right I know
what my weaknesses are I dont need
Sybok to take me on a tour of them

McCOY
If youd just unbend and allow your-
self --
KIRK
To be brainwashed by this con man
McCOY
I was wrong This con man took away
my pain
KIRK

Dammit Bones youre a doctor You
know that pain and guilt cant be
taken away with the wave of a magic
wand Theyre things we carry with
us -- the things that make us who
we are If we lose them we lose
ourselves I dont want my pain
taken away I need my pain

A tense silence broken by
UHURAS VOICE
Sybok this is the Bridge We are in

approach of the Great Barrier

Sybok is filled with excitement eager to go to the
bridge

SYBOK
Captain Im afraid youll have to
remain here Spock Doctor

come with me

Sybok and McCoy start for the exit but stop when they
realize that Spock is remaining with Kirk

SYBOK
(puzzled)
Spock

SPOCK
I cannot go with you
SYBOK
(cant believe it)
Why

SPOCK
I stand with my captain

SYBOK
I dont understand

SPOCK

You are my brother but you do not
know me I am not the outcast boy
you left behind Since that time I
have found myself and my place in
the world here among these
people my shipmates This ship
is my life

McCoy reacts to this speech After a moment he takes
his place with Kirk and Spock

McCOY
I guess youd better count me out
too

this unique part of the galaxy

Sybok regards Kirk Spock and McCoy with affection
This is only a temporary setback He knows the
ultimate win will be his

SYBOK

Sybok heads for the exit Doors whoosh open to reveal
the guards outside

KIRK
Wait
(Sybok turns)
You know well never make it through
the Barrier

SYBOK
But if we do will that convince you

that my vision was true

KIRK
What vision

SYBOK
Given to me by God
(as the others react)
He waits for us on the other side

KIRK

You are mad
SYBOK

The fiery look in Syboks eyes might be confidence
it might be madness He turns and exits

EXT SPACE - THE GREAT BARRIER 188

Enterprise is poised on the edge of the giant starcluster
known as the Great Barrier It is visibly stunning and
equally dangerous We see giant regions of star form-
ations as well as expanding blast waves from exploding
stars Beams of radiation from pulsars sweep the tiny

and insignificant ship bathing her in color

INT BRIDGE - ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN 189

Sybok is on the Bridge Uhura Chekov and Sulu are at
their stations Caithlin Korrd and Talbot are also
present They and the rest of the crew are transfixed
by the viewscreen awed by the vista of a sky filled
with thousands of stars each a fiery orange

But what really draws their attention is the black
thundercloud looming directly ahead Here starts the
ring of gas and dust that enshrouds the center of
the galaxy hiding it from view Behind this black
veil lies a region that emits ten times more energy
than our sun Through the chinks in the wall we see
flashes of blue light -- hints of the fires blazing
within

The ships monitor screens go blank

SULU

They say no ship can survive it

SYBOK
I say theyre wrong I say the danger
is an illusion

We have no instrument readings Is
it there or isnt it

And with that the ship plows into the Barrier straight

Enterprise again

ANGLE - INSIDE THE BARRIER

Surprisingly there is no turbulence no buffeting The
Enterprise travels through a fantastic passageway of
light and color Then quite suddenly the gas clouds
part and the ship enters a region of incredible calm and

serenity like the clear space at the eye of a hurricane

herself were trying to break free Without warning
a pillar of sheer rock rips up through the surface

As if responding to McCoys question the energy shaft

throbs From the swirling dust within it a living form
begins to take shape The shape is powerful beautiful
enticing

Sybok and the others watch in wonder The wind it kicks
up causes them to stagger back

begins to take shape And it takes on many forms each

injured tries to rise

for his own pleasure

The Being is on the verge of zapping McCoy when Sybok
interrupts

SYBOK
Stop The God of Sha Ka Ree would
not do this

By way of reply The Being smiles a truely wicked smile

and Sybok realizes to his horror that hes been tricked
