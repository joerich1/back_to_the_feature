touched it

But whenever I go and check —
there’s nothing there

RACHELLE
And you’re sure your just not
imagining things

INT JONES HOUSEHOLD — UPSTAIRS HALLWAY — DAY

Zoé walks up to her bedroom door and opens it

VISION
Zoé sits in a chair inside a room made out of four glass walls
It is quite squashed

A glass roof which seems to blocks all of the oxygen out from
the room

Zoé looks up She mouths some words towards the camera
A deafening high pitched noise can then be heard
The glass around shatters into a million pieces
Zoés eyes brightly flash
The glass floats around her head
The glass then fires itself towards the camera

ZOE
SHUTUP JUST SHUTUP

The room goes extremely silent Zoé stands up and looks into the
standing mirror

Before she can dry her face a female figure stands behind Z0é’s
reflection — wearing a long white hospital patient gown

This figure has dirty mud-ridded dark blond hair which reaches
her shoulders

Zoé looks behind her — nothing

The figure remains in the reflection — her face mangled green
and bruised as if possessed by the devil itself

ZOE
Sadie

The figure descends towards the glass — towards Z06’s
reflection

ZOE
Come Take me Sadie

The figure lifts her arm up and moves forward
The arm soon ascends out from the glass and into the real world
The mirror around this bruised-scaly arm shatters

Zoé falls back onto her back and backs up to the wall She
breathes heavily

ZOE
Take me Sadie

Zoé puts her hands round her eyes
ZOE
(whispering to herself)

It’s not real

— finger pointed straight at Zoé
