1 EXT SCHOOLYARD - NIGHT 1

Gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible

A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link fence

and on the other by the one-story public school buildings
Spray-can hieroglyphics A Los Angeles public school in
a blue collar neighborhood

ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS where a trash dumpster
looms in a LOW ANGLE A CAT crosses FRAME

CLOSE ON CAT which freezes alert sensing something just
beyond human perception

A sourceless wind rises and with it a keening WHINE
Papers blow across the pavement

The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster

Windows rattle in their frames

The WHINE intensifies accompanied now by a wash of frigid
PURPLE LIGHT A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-
head blows in all the windows facing the yard

CU - CAT its eyes are wide as the glare dies

ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES arc from the dumpster to a water
faucet and climb a drain pipe like a Jacobs Ladder

2 EXT SCHOOLYARD NIGHT 2

SLOW PAN as the sound of stray electrical CRACKLING subsides
FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling
faced away in the previously empty yard

He stands slowly

The man is in his late thirties tall and powerfully built
moving with graceful precision

He is the TERMINATOR

He glances down taking calm inventory of himself and
notices that a fine white ash covers his skin He brushes
at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence scanning
his surroundings

Without warning Terminator hammer-punches him in the temple
flinging him with a CLANG into the jungle gym He drops
to the ground in a still heap

The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one
motion Terminator catches the knife-wielders wrist in
an inhuman grip the punches the leader with piledriver
force just below the breastbone

ANGLE - PAVEMENT as the knife clatters down The punks
combat boots are on tiptoe barely touching the ground

ANGLE - TWO SHOT Terminator and the leader close together
The punks eyes are wide his veins distended with an
agonizing pressure Terminator jerks his fist back with a
WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME

The last tough is stumbling away gaping with terror He
backs into a chainlink fence turns to run along it finds
he is in a corner

Terminator takes a step toward him his gaze ominous

The punk begins shakily stripping off his clothes
Thunder peals overhead

razor-knife reaches full extension in Terminators hand
right above him

It slashes viciously downward

Matt rolls and the pillow is SLIT OPEN where his throat

had been

Whoah

Terminator catches him by the hair and slashes down again
Matt grabs his wrist in both hands

The enormous muscles of his arms which seem capable of
bench-pressing a Chrysler strain and knot against the
pressure of the killers single arm

And still the blade moves closer to his throat

With a final heave Matt deflects the down-pressure sideways
and the blade snaps with a CLINK against the headboard

his fists together into Terminators temple He picks up a
brass deco lamp and brings it down with piledriver force

machine-pistol from beneath his overcoat where it has been
hanging on a shoulder strap

A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood
An orgy of shattering glass

a burst of 9mm fire meant for her

Picks up the fallen assault rifle

Runs with powerful strides to his motorcycle
