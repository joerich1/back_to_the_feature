TEASER

FADE IN

EXT FOREST HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

A PICKUP TRUCK barrels straight toward us kicking up dust in

its wake

We swing around to the bed of the truck where a scruffy-
looking MAN and WOMAN (20s) lean against their overstuffed

backpacks Her foot nudges against his
seductively and he grins right back

INT PICKUP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

She smiles

The DRIVER (late 30s husky) sings absently along to loud

BLUEGRASS MUSIC

Behind him he hears TAPPING - the Man knocking persistently

on the glass between them

DRIVER
(kind of a dick)
No potty breaks

MAN
(barely audible)
You can drop us here

DRIVER

I’m not kidding Whip it out and

go off the side

MAN
But--

DRIVER
I won’t watch

MAN

Dude no Let us off here

Well uh--
(to the Woman
mischievously)
Walk

JUMP CUT TO

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 2

BACKPACKS hit the pavement with a THUD followed quickly by
the Man and Woman

The Woman nods toward a SIGN in the distance - “Black Lake
Wildlife Area”

WOMAN
How far’s the lake

DRIVER
(leaning out his window)
‘Bout a mile east

WOMAN
(to the Man)
Perfect
(with a wink)
Because I need a bath

Off the Man’s stupefied grin

CUT TO
EXT FOREST - TWILIGHT

The Man pushes through a thicket trying to keep up with the
Woman

MAN
Not that I don’t love this sexy
impulsiveness thing but what are
the chances we get lost and die
horribly

WOMAN
(smirking)
Keep talking like that youre
gonna start lactating

They’ve arrived at
EXT BLACK LAKE - COVE - TWILIGHT

A secluded inlet of BLACK LAKE the setting of the first two
Lake Placid movies She steps towards the water

MAN
Fine Make fun of my fear but
when a wolverine jumps out and
mauls you you’re
(eyes wide)
Youre getting naked

(CONTTNURFD )
LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 3

Yup she sure is Before the Man can even comprehend it
she’s STRIPPED DOWN splashing the cold water on her face
down her arms and onto her chest She cleans up well The
Man frantically unbuttons his jeans In his hurry he trips
over his pants and FALLS face first into the water

The Woman LAUGHS When he surfaces she pushes him back
down straddling him We see as much of their lustful
splashing as standards will allow

UNDERWATER - SOMETHING MOVES

BACK TO THE COUPLE They hear a GURGLE coming from behind
them The girl stands covers herself up

UNDERWATER - OUR POV MOVES SWIFTLY TOWARDS THEM

MAN (CONTD)
Ow

We follow his foot as he lifts it out of the water There’s
a tiny insignificant drop of BLOOD on it A bite

WOMAN
(laughing)
Wolverine

The blood DRIPS from his injury into the pond An instant
later something KNOCKS him on his ass He tries to swat the
creature away but his arm is TUGGED into the water The
Woman takes a step towards him but he holds his hand out to
stop her - and he’s MISSING THREE FINGERS

MAN
No No wait--

Before the Woman can get a hold on him he disappears into
the muck She splashes in after him to no avail In shock
she starts hyperventilating

WOMAN
(too scared to yell)
Help gotta-- gotta get help
someone--

Without warning both the girl and our POV are PLUNGED
UNDERWATER Writhing she tries to get free of the SWARM OF
CREATURES around her forms that never quite become clear
All we can make out is a whirl of flicking tails and biting
mouths Blood blossoms out of her wounds like crimson
explosions

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 4

As she’s torn to grisly pieces fading into the murky
distance

SUPER LAKE PLACID 3

We rise back towards the surface and see something there
TOES

EXT BICKERMAN CABIN - DOCK - MORNING

As we break the surface we realize that we’re in a different
place Same lake but this time next to the BICKERMAN
CABIN A boy CONNOR BICKERMAN sits on the dock
dangling his toes into the water

AN SUV is parked in the driveway
SUPER Black Lake Maine - 2007

CUT TO
INT BICKERMAN CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

NATHAN BICKERMAN (early 40s the kind of guy who gets his
hands dirty) carries an EMPTY BOX through the front door (we
notice the “Welcome to the Bickerman’s” door mat)

The place is cluttered with the possessions of the former
owner who apparently was way into animals A taxidermied
squirrel hangs on the wall next to an empty lizard cage and a
book called “Mammals of Maine” Nathan seems right at home

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
How can this place smell like
cookies and foot cream at the same
time

Nathan’s wife SUSAN BICKERMAN (late 30s) walks in behind
him She’s beautiful but frazzled (in a Nancy Botwin sort of
way) and totally out of place in the rustic environment

NATHAN
Aunt Sadie’s two favorite things
besides dropping F-bombs

SUSAN
I’m not gonna miss that at
Thanksgiving

Nathan picks up an old family photo - SADIE BICKERMAN (Cloris
Leachman) age 40 standing on the dock with a 10-year-old
Nathan who wears a life-jacket Written in sharpie on the
bottom “Sadie and Nathan Summer ‘75”

(CONTTNURFD )

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 5

NATHAN
Everything’s just how I remember
it

Nathan’s smile disappears for a moment Say whatever you
want about Sadie but he misses her He puts the photo
gently into a box then moves on to a picture of Sadie and
DELORES BICKERMAN (Betty White)

NATHAN (CONT’D)
Never thought shed
(trying not to say “die”)
I never thought I’d be cleaning out
her house

Susan sees his expression tries to lighten the mood

SUSAN
I’ve got a pop quiz for you mister
EPA scientist
(re lizard cage)
What kind of animal lives in a tank
like this

He points at her feet

NATHAN
Smart money’s on that lizard

SUSAN
Wha--

Susan tries to kick off the reptile but there’s nothing
there She can tell from Nathan’s smirk that he’s messing
with her

SUSAN (CONTD)
Nice Freak out the city girl

NATHAN
I’m giving you material for your
book The attack of the rogue five-
inch reptile

SUSAN
I don’t share the Bickerman
infatuation with--

NATHAN
(playfully interrupting)
Nature

(CONTTNURFD )

FH

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 6

SUSAN
Disgusting creatures

He nods It’s a fair assessment

NATHAN
(deadpan)
Seriously though there is an
escaped lizard somewhere in the
house Just a heads up

CONNOR
Can we keep it

Neither of them noticed that Connor had come in

SUSAN
Absolutely not If we see it your
dad is going to take care of it--

NATHAN
(“come on”
We do have the tank

SUSAN
--and by take care of it I mean
he’s going to smash it to death
with a hammer

Someone KNOCKS Nathan and Susan share a confused look
SHERIFF TONY WILLINGER (30s) stands at the door with his hat
in his hands looking like he just ran over their dog His

Brooklyn accent betrays his big-city roots

WILLINGER
Youre Sadie’s nephew

Nathan nods

NATHAN
Nathan Bickerman

WILLINGER
Willinger Tony Willinger

Willinger pauses for a second finding the right words
WILLINGER (CONTD)
I’m afraid you haven’t been told

the whole story About what
happened to your aunt

(CONTTNURFD )

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 7

Concerned about where this is going Nathan looks back at
Connor

NATHAN
Hey buddy why don’t you run out
to the lake give us a few minutes
to talk

WILLINGER
(grim)
Actually Mister Bickerman you’re
gonna want him to stay inside
Off Nathan’s troubled expression

TIME CUT TO

INT BICKERMAN CABIN - LATER

Willinger sits Nathan paces Susan stands off to the side

hands on her temples

NATHAN
(WIF”)
A crocodile In Maine

WILLINGER
Crocodiles Plural

FLASH TO
LAKE PLACID 2 - SADIE BICKERMAN IS KILLED BY A CROCODILE
FLASH BACK TO

Nathan who looks away from Willinger overwhelmed Susan
puts her hand on his shoulder

NATHAN
This is Unreal

WILLINGER
It sounds just as crazy to my ears
But I had to tell you the truth
not that garbage on the news about
a boating accident

NATHAN
(dead serious)
Tell me they aren’t still out
there

Off Susan looking out the window

INT BICKERMAN CABIN - KITCHEN - SIMULTANEOUS

Connor sits at the kitchen table just out of earshot A TOY

DINOSAUR in his hand another on the table He hears
MUMBLING from the living room

With a swift motion he attacks the dinosaur on the table
with the one in his hand making a dinosaur GROWL

One of the toys falls off the table Connor drops to the
ground searching for it but instead he sees the LIZARD
It scurries to the open back door and disappears outside

Connor briefly glances at the door to the living room then
follows the reptile outside

INT BICKERMAN CABIN - SIMULTANEOUS
Back to the adults

WILLINGER
I can assure you there’s nothing
bigger than a trout in that lake
Rangers came down with sonar rigs
checked the whole lake back to
front

SUSAN
(to Nathan)
We can’t tell Connor It would
give him nightmares for weeks

NATHAN
So we just lock him in a cage
stop him from ever swimming again

SUSAN
If we find a cage that’s big
enough

EXT BICKERMAN CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

Connor hurries towards the lake following the lizard

Just as he’s about to catch up with it a small CROCODILE
tear out of the water grabbing the lizard and pulling it
underwater

Connor steps back shocked But then a tail FLICKS in the

water He cautiously steps closer to get a better look
Then starts following the swimming beast

INT BICKERMAN CABIN - SIMULTANEOUS
Nathan Susan and Willinger

NATHAN
I guess moving here is out of the
question

Willinger looks a question

NATHAN (CONT’D)
(distractedly)
I’m doing a research study for the
EPA Elk migration

WILLINGER
Like I said lake’s been cleared
But I wouldn’t let your son run
around out here just to be safe
Maybe find a place in town instead

Susan walks to the kitchen door opens it and is faced with
her worst nightmare

SUSAN
Where’d he go

EXT BLACK LAKE - COVE - CONTINUOUS

Connor’s made his way to the COVE we saw earlier Remnants
of a torn-apart BACKPACK litter the ground but Connor’s
oblivious He’s following the CREATURE

CONNOR
Come here little guy I won’t
hurt you

A TINY CROCODILE scampers out of the water Maybe a foot and
a half long it’s nowhere near big enough to be scary

Connor is bewitched and moves in to pet it It SNAPS at
him

CONNOR (CONT’D)
Whoa

Thinking fast he pulls a piece of JERKY out of his pocket
and tosses it to the croc As it’s devoured another TINY
HEAD appears in the water And ANOTHER But he’s not scared
- Connor’s making new friends and he couldn’t be happier

CONNOR (CONT’D)
I guess I get a pet after all

(CONTTNURFD )

SUSAN (0S)
(yelling)
Connor

The crocodiles dart under the water Connor turns around
just in time for Susan to grab him by the arm She’s not
angry just relieved to see him in one piece

SUSAN (CONT’D)
We told you to stay inside big

guy
He looks back at the water filled with curiosity
Off of that we pan a few feet over out of Connor’s view -

to the Man’s SEVERED HEAD most of the meat chewed off

ACT ONE
INT BICKERMAN HOUSE - MORNING

The Bickerman House is a modestly decorated suburban home
Much more inviting than the cabin but it lacks the rustic
charm

Nathan Bickerman races around the house getting ready for
work He’s buttoning up his khaki shirt which bears the EPA
logo Susan is eating a bowl of cereal staring at some
MANUSCRIPT PAGES

SUPER TWO YEARS LATER

SUSAN
It’s six AM and you’re not on the
trail you going soft on me
Thought you had a big day

No response

SUSAN (CONT’D)
Can I get a “good morning”

NATHAN
We lost another one

That’s all he had to say She’s instantly more sympathetic

NATHAN (CONT’D)
Signal from the elk’s radio collar
became erratic then stopped
entirely yesterday afternoon
(with authority)
I plan on making this the last one

SUSAN
Meaning you know what’s been
happening to them

NATHAN
I think we’ve got a poacher
bringing hunters onto state land
He quickly laces his shoes and grabs his keys
SUSAN

Promise me you’ll remember one
thing they’re just elk

(CONTTNURFD )

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 12

NATHAN
(smiling)
And it’s just a book you’re
writing huh

SUSAN
(joking)
Of course not this is important
(serious)
I hope you find your bad guys

She plants a kiss on him that momentarily stuns him

NATHAN
I forgot what we were talking
about My brain turned off

She smirks then goes back to her cereal
As Nathan’s walking out the door

SUSAN
Don’t forget the little monster

NATHAN
(remembering)
Connor
(yelling)
Hey Connor I’m walking out the
door you planning on saying
goodbye

SMASH CUT TO
A CROCODILE’S TERRIFYING JAWS

-a stuffed crocodile Connor (now age 10) carries it out
of his bedroom half-asleep

CONNOR
(confused)
Goodbye When did you get home

NATHAN
I got in late something came up at
work I’11 tell you all about it
tonight
Nathan steps out the door

CONNOR

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 13

NATHAN
(in a hurry)
Gotta go buddy

He’s out the door Connor stares after him for a beat
CONNOR
(to the door)
Bye
Off Connor’s disheartened reaction
CUT TO
INT BICKERMAN HOUSE - LATER

Mid-morning Susan sits at her laptop typing She’s worlds
away

Our POV starts approaching her stealthily Closer and
closer yet she’s completely oblivious

Suddenly Connor’s STUFFED CROCODILE lunges at her scaring
the crap out of her

SUSAN
Mother of--

Connor LAUGHS happy to get any reaction out of her Susan
just SIGHS

SUSAN (CONT’D)
(jokingkind of)
Next year you’re going to summer
school Or boarding school

CONNOR
You’ve been working all morning
when are you going to be done

SUSAN
Never I’m a writer
CONNOR
Can I turn on the TV
SUSAN
I need to concentrate just for a
little bit--
CONNOR

That’s what you said yesterday

(CONTTNURFD )
LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 14

SUSAN
--after that you’ll have my full
attention Can you please--

CONNOR SUSAN
Get out of the house --get out of the house

Clearly this is a conversation they’ve repeated many times
Connor’s already sullenly grabbing his backpack He waits
until she returns to work then goes into the kitchen
EXT BICKERMAN HOUSE - MORNING

It’s just as boring on the outside

Connor jumps on his bike starts pedaling then sees some
OLDER BOYS also on bikes

CONNOR
Hey
The Boys make some disparaging remarks about Connor that we
can’t quite hear then LAUGH Connor starts moving towards
them but they start pedaling away

CONNOR (CONTD)
Wait up

But they’re going too fast Defeated Connor turns around
and bikes away in the opposite direction

EXT BLACK LAKE - COVE - DAY
It’s dark overcast and depressing Equally depressing is
the look on Connor’s face as he pushes his bike through the
forest That is until he sees his reptile friends
REVEAL FOUR CROCS each 10 feet long Things have changed
CONNOR
(perking up)
Feeding time

Connor dumps out his backpack near the water’s edge Some
chicken a few packages of dripping thawed-out ground beef

and A DEAD RABBIT

CONNOR (CONTD)
I caught the rabbit myself

The crocs lunge at the food

(CONTTNURFD )
LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 15

CONNOR (CONTD)
I guess the semi did most of the
work But I scraped it off the
highway

They’ve already ripped through every scrap of meat and are
starting to claw and bite each other trying to steal the
last bits from each others’ mouths Connor gets a thrill
from seeing the giant reptiles fighting

He checks his bag for more meat but it’s empty

CONNOR (CONT’D)
That’s all I’ve got

Then one of them SNAPS AT HIM and he falls backwards

CONNOR (CONTD)
Hey no eating the cook

They don’t look like they’re listening He scrambles away
from the shore

CONNOR (CONTD)
I’ll I’11 try to bring more

The look of concern on Connor’s face grows as the crocs
slither menacingly under the water We hear prelap STATIC

CUT TO
INT SUV - DAY

Nathan Bickerman is in the driver’s seat tuning the radio as
he drives down a forest road

RADIO VOICES
-- lots of activity on the
waterfront this morning people
boarding up --
(he switches stations)
-- less talk more music --
(he switches stations)
-- the storm is smashing its way up
the east coast with record
rainfall predicted for some areas
What does that mean for Maine
Find out after--

Nathan flips off the radio and dials his cell

(CONTTNURFD )

NATHAN
Sheriff Willinger
(beat)
I’ve got a lead on my missing
elk
He notices something along the side of the road
NATHAN (CONTD)
(into phone)
it seems like he’s migrated
right into Sadie’s backyard What
do you think the chances are that--
(beat)
I know Can’t be Gotta go
He hangs up his cell as he pulls the SUV to the shoulder
EXT FOREST HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
Nathan gets out of the SUV and grabs a RADAR ANTENNA from the
back seat He switches it on and it immediately starts
BEEPING He’s tracking something and it’s close
He walks into the forest right past the “Black Lake Wildlife
Area” sign from the teaser
CUT TO
INT BICKERMAN HOUSE - DAY

Connor slips in unnoticed behind VICA his busty
Bulgarian nanny She’s watching “Deal Or No Deal” on TV

VICA
(to the TV wary)
I would not be trusting this man
with his boxes There could be
snake in box

Her POODLE barks ineffectually at Connor causing Vica to
notice him

VICA (CONTD)
Oy Boy-child Where have you
been

CONNOR
Where’s my mom

Just then Susan walks in from the other room coat on
laptop bag slung over her shoulder

(CONTTNURFD )
LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 17

SUSAN
I’m leaving you with Vica for the
rest of the day

CONNOR
But you said--

SUSAN
I don’t have time for a tantrum
Connor

He looks at her something weighing on him heavily

CONNOR
I just-- I need to show you
something

SUSAN

(with a fake smile)
Once the book is done

Even Susan knows that’s like saying “never” Before he can
comment she’s out the door leaving him alone with Vica

CUT TO
INT BICKERMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Connor opens the freezer finds it empty His face falls
VICA
You should not be in out-of-doors
you catch bird flu
She feels his forehead
VICA (CONTD)
(dead serious)
You have been touching birds

Connor rolls his eyes

CONNOR
Can you take me to the store

Vica spends a moment looking at her fingernails

CONNOR (CONTD)
Vica you know how I promised not
to tell my parents about your
boyfriend and that disgusting
thing you were doing to him on the
porch

(CONTTNURFD )
LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 18

VICA

CONNOR
(insistent)
You’re driving me to the store

CUT TO
INT GROCERY STORE - LATER

Connor (wearing his backpack) and Vica wander the aisles
Vica’s brow is furrowed She stops a passing STOCKBOY

VICA
Where I might find banitsa

Connor sneaks past them to the meat freezer

STOCKBOY
Is that like a little banana

Connor slips a steak into the backpack looks back and sees
Vica and the Stockboy are still distracted He steals a few
more

VICA
From Bulgaria Banitsa Baaa--

STOCKBOY
(really confused)
Lamb chops are in the deli ma’am

The backpack will barely shut Connor smiles
Until a hand GRABS HIS BACKPACK STERNLY

WOMANS VOICE

(angry)
What did I tell you

Connor looks up in terror at SUSAN BICKERMAN Vica backs
quietly away from the confrontation

SUSAN
(sotto)
Connor you get caught stealing
meat again and-- And I never came
up with a punishment but you can
bet your little klepto butt that
I’m going to think of one now
(about to throttle him)

(CONTTNURFD )
LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 19

SUSAN (CONTD)
Side note I don’t even want to
know what youre doing with all
this raw meat

OWNER
What’s the problem here

The OWNER of the store saunters up a permanent smile stapled
to his face We may recognize him - he’s the DRIVER from the
teaser

SUSAN
No problem

She shoots a glare at Connor that says otherwise and the
Owner sees it

OWNER
Wait
(squints at Connor)
This kid is on our shoplifter wall
of shame He’s the meat-fiend

While they’re talking Connor plays with a display of
CIGARETTE LIGHTERS Totally uninterested in what the adults
are saying He pockets one

SUSAN
I promise you he’s not a meat-
fiend he’s just my son
(desperate)
And he was just leaving

The Owner considers letting the whole thing go but Connor
gives him a “fuck you old man” grimace

OWNER
Let’s all step into the back room

As Susans forced smile slips into hopelessness
CUT TO
EXT FOREST - DAY
The clouds roll menacingly overhead Nathan’s holding the
ANTENNA scanning it slowly back and forth across the forest
all around him Every few seconds it BEEPS softly
NATHAN

Come on you’ve gotta be out here
somewhere

(CONTTNURFD )

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED 20

Suddenly the antenna BEEPS LOUDLY A signal

Nathan moves quickly in that direction crawling over a
downed tree He takes off in a cautious run moving faster
and faster as the BEEPS get louder and louder

As he clears a thicket BAM Nathan runs into something at
full speed and is knocked on his ass

ELLIE
Oh my God

Nathan looks up and finds himself surrounded by COLLEGE KIDS
Four of them 2 girls and 2 boys One of the girls ELLIE
is helping the boy AARON who Nathan ran into All of them
are carrying big backpacks

As Ellie touches Aaron’s arm to lift him up they share an
intimate look She lets go embarrassed

AARON
(to Ellie soft)
Thanks
(to Nathan)
I think you knocked out a filling

NATHAN
Sorry about that I have an
alright orthodontist

CHARLIE
(sort of a douche)
Thanks for the tip Speedy
Gonzales
(points to the antenna)
Maybe we can call him from your
space-phone

Nathan looks at the antenna - it’s bent in half and
completely non-functional

NATHAN
It’s a radar antenna I’ma
zoologist doing a study with the
EPA Elk

ELLIE
Elk Like deer with big antlers

NATHAN
Yeah pretty much

The kids exchange a knowing look

CUT TO
EXT BLACK LAKE - FAR SHORE - LATER

Nathan and the Campers stare down at something which is
obviously unsettling The other girl TARA chimes in

TARA
Are they usuallylike that

Nathan looks at her dumbfounded

NATHAN
«--NO

FROM OVERHEAD

We see the DECAPITATED HEAD OF AN ELK still wearing its
RADIO COLLAR Its grizzly entrails lead into the water

NATHAN (CONT’D)

Unless there’s a species of flying
elk heads that I haven’t heard of
I’m gonna say this isn’t normal
The EPA’s been trying to
reintroduce Elk to this area hence
the collar My job is to figure
out why they’re dying off

They hear THUNDER in the distance
NATHAN (CONT’D)
Some day you guys picked to go

camping

ELLIE
You’re telling me

She looks at Aaron but he looks away
Nathan’s cell BUZZES

NATHAN

INTERCUT
EXT GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT

Susan sits on the curb fiddling her KEYS between her
fingers

SUSAN
I’m going to recap the day I’ve
had My publisher called to tell me
my novel’s not commercial enough to
sell Two years of living in the
middle of nowhere working my ass
off practically ignoring my family
for nothing And now our sirloin-
addled son just got caught
shoplifting Again

Nathan is silent for a second

NATHAN
(deadpan)
Is that it

Susan’s mouth hangs open whether to laugh or cry she’s not
sure

SUSAN
He stole a backpack full of I
don’t know pork chops and rib
roasts and Anyway my publisher
wants their advance back so don’t
buy anything expensive except
maybe flood insurance Do we have
that

NATHAN

SUSAN
Of course
(beat)
Did we not feed Connor the right
things as a baby Did I eat too
much curry when he was in the womb
and now he’s a sociopath

NATHAN
He’s not a sociopath Susie he’s a
little boy Put him on the phone
Ill let my paternal presence be
felt

(CONTTNURFD )

He’s not here I sent him home with
Vica

NATHAN
(earnest)
I’m sorry about the book I
thought it was great

SUSAN
You fell asleep reading it

NATHAN
(joking)
And it haunted my dreams

SUSAN
Ill see you at home

NATHAN
Bye babe

As Nathan hangs up he furrows his brow A lot’s on his

mind but he has to deal with one thing at a time

He

rejoins the College Kids who are huddled around the head

AARON
What could have eaten the body A
bear

CHARLIE
I told you I saw cougar tracks
back there

TARA

He wasn’t asking you Charlie he
was asking the zookeeper

Again Nathan is dumbfounded

NATHAN
-zoologist

TARA
(quietly to Ellie)
What did I say

Nathan takes a closer look at the severed elk head

winces from the smell

NATHAN
This is the thirteenth Elk that’s
been killed around here

NATHAN (CONTD)
And if I’m right it wasn’t a bear
or a cougar It was a trigger-
happy hick named Reba

CUT TO

INT WINCHESTER BAR - DAY

REBA THRACE a firecracker disguised as a woman slams back a

beer with TWO MEN

NATHAN (VO)
- a hunting guide who poaches
endangered species on state land

As the teenage WAITER sets down another round of drinks Reba
slaps him on the ass

CUT BACK TO

EXT BLACK LAKE - FAR SHORE - RESUME

CHARLIE
Sounds like a cougar to me

ELLIE
Wait wait Why would a hunter
chop off the head

TARA
Yeah isn’t head-meat delicious

Charlie raises his eyebrows If there was another pervert
around to high-five he’d do it

NATHAN
One because she’s a lunatic if
her reputation is to be believed
Two because there’s a giant radio
tracker around its neck and unless
you want me following you home it
has to come off This is the
easiest way

They all stare at the head for a beat

ELLIE
Hunters are weird

NATHAN

(no kidding)

little spurts of blood shooting out of it

HOLY HELL - A TWENTY FIVE FOOT CROC TEARS OUT OF THE WATER
LITERALLY BITING THE BOAT IN HALF

We lose Nathan and Willinger in the chaos somewhere under
the float of debris

Susan flinches from the sound of the EXPLOSION followed

underwater for crocs but the rain makes it difficult to see

He takes a moment to steel himself then DIVES IN with
determination

SPLASH SPLASH SPLASH - he moves as quickly as he can
through the waves the cabin in his sights

But then he sees something on another piece of wreckage

closing in He only has a few seconds

He reaches out - and GRABS the sharkstick

The massive Bull Croc opens its jaws behind him water
funneling into its mouth like a black hole

The jaws CRUSH DOWN on Willinger but they’re held open by a
piece of BOAT DEBRIS (think Luke using the bone to hold open
the Rancor’s mouth in “Return of the Jedi”)

Willinger’s been given two seconds to get away and he takes
it swimming fiercely to the shore and taking off running
sharkstick in hand

The Bull Croc SNAPS the boat debris in half then recedes
back into the water

his shuddering hands

He TURNS THE KEY and before the engine has even turned
over

its way in Nathan uses every ounce of strength to keep it
out but its a losing struggle It BURSTS through snapping
and lunging at all of them Nathan Connor and Susan all
back away but Vica’s in shock - and it costs her The croc

Before he can ask his question he realizes the answer Lets

more wells out of his nose and the cut he got from the bull

He looks at the ignition - the keys are still there

He comes into a CLEARING at the edge of which

from exhaustion Reba is kicking twisting trying to

scramble out of the croc’s clenched jaws

Brett doesn’t have time to aim - he raises the rifle and
FIRES

With her free leg Reba KICKS the knife deeper into the
croc’s head and in response it FLIPS HER OVER trying to
break her legs

She’s able to PULL her leg a few inches out of the beast’s
mouth but the motion SHREDS OPEN A GASH on her leg

The croc lets go for one fateful instant trying to get a
better grip and Reba starts to BOLT but

Brett FIRES again
in SLOW MOTION the bullet RIPS THROUGH REBA’S SHOULDER
then TEARS INTO THE CROCODILE’S EYE The croc GROWLS in
pain then forcefully BASHES its way through some foliage and
out of sight

Susan makes eye contact with Willinger as he starts to drive
off--

Only to have the Bull Croc GRAB the back of the car and DRAG
IT BACKWARDS Susan’s eyes are still locked with Willinger’s

NATHAN (CONTD)
And we are certainly not in control
of our planet
Nathan joins Susan and Connor The family reunited
CUT TO
EXT BLACK LAKE - COVE - DAY

Connor walks cautiously out to the cove this time with
Nathan in tow

He points to where he first fed the crocodiles They talk
but we don’t hear them

NATHAN (PRELAP)
There are no rules of nature No
system that we can catalogue and
analyze that will predict what
animals will do or where they’1l

go

LAKE PLACID 3 - 3RD DRAFT - 051509 - D REED

Connor kneels down

One lone remnant of the mighty family

Without even looking at Nathan he STOMPS ON IT

He sees something - a BABY CROCODILE

CUT TO

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Nathan stands in front of a group of COLLEGE STUDENTS
is among them

NATHAN
So with that out of the way let me
regale you with the story of a
unique species The Maine River
Crocodile And for the record
it’s extinct

The class LAUGHS

EXT FOREST - DAY

ELLIE

CUT TO

The day after we last saw him Aaron stumbles through the
forest completely lost He’s starving thirsty and

desperate

OUR POV SUDDENLY SHOOTS TOWARDS HIM

and the last thing we see are JAWS SMASHING SHUT

THE END
