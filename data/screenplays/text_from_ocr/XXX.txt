TRIPLE X
FADE IN
EXT PRAGUE - NIGHT
On a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL The night is
spooky with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones
and medieval walls

A NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley

There is a DOOR at the end of the alley MUSIC can be
faintly heard from inside

EXT ROOFTOP - NIGHT

High above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies
from the roof Hes watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES

He pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES

A BOLT flies trailing CABLE

THUNK It sticks into the alley wall below
EXT THE ALLEY - NIGHT

As he passes by the ominous Cathedral the Hacker spins sure
hes heard something

But theres nothing there He continues on
Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above
WHAM He kicks the Hacker into the wall knocking him out

The Intruder pulls off his mask revealing the chiseled
features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT His name is
STERLING

STERLING
I hate to drop in unexpectedly

Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE
from his coat Inside the case is a DATA CHIP Sterling
tucks it away

Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit revealing a crisp TUXEDO
underneath He pulls out CAR KEYS In a quick insert we see
the “ASTON-MARTIN” LOGO

As he strolls back out the alley he HEARS something and
flattens against the wall
A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop blocking his exit
The SUVs HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker
BAD GUYS get out to investigate pulling out weapons

Cornered Sterling heads deeper into the alley staying in
the shadows He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading
towards

As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside He
smooths his hair and prepares to blend in with the crowd

INT CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

Sterling comes through the door and his face falls Hes
stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT

We see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX Onstage is PvAMMSTEIN a
bizarre German industrial-metal band

The tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix over
their heads Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted with
fiber optic lights Its a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE
OUTFITS

Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the
crowd With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin ina
chicken coop

ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young
GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL
with multi-colored hair They look like a post-Apocalyptic
Bonnie and Clyde They are YORGI and PETRA

Yorgi checks his watch His delivery is late Then his CELL
PHONE rings Hes getting the news from outside

He looks down spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd With
that’ look that tux theres no mistaking what he is

They make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod
Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone

Immediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterlings direction
Viktor is huge with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE

Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit pushing
through the freaky crowd
EXT CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

Sterlings ASTON-MARTIN VANTAGE screeches away from the curb
INT ASTON-MARTIN - MOVING - NIGHT

Sterling is at the wheel of his spy car He plugs the DATA
CHIP into the dash and punches buttons A computer screen
says “DATA DOWNLOADING

He sees a BLACKED-OUT SUV racing up behind him

He accelerates and hits a SWITCH

ARMORED PLATING slides up over the rear window-

EXT COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT

The SUV is right behind him Viktor rolls down the passenger
window readies his PISTOL

The rear bumper of the spy car opens SMOKE BOMBS drop out
They explode in MASSIVE CLOUDS obscuring the narrow street
Sterling skids around a corner

The blinded bad guys drive straight into a STOREFRONT Glass
and merchandise flies as the SUV gets stuck

The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop
Blocking the road ahead are two more SUVs

A MOTORCYCLE slides to a stop in front of them The rider is
ANDERS a leather clad biker who looks half Viking

Anders pulls out a SILENCED SUB-MACHINE GUN and starts
BLASTING

BULLETS SLAM into the Aston-Martin cracking the bullet-proof
glass shattering headlights and BLOWING OUT THE FRONT
TIRES

Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on
the RIMS

INT ASTON-MARTIN - IDLING - NIGHT

Sterling notices an ERROR MESSAGE now flashing on his
computer screen TRANSMISSION ERROR-DATA PARTIALLY SENT

Sterling looks around desperately Somehow hes got to get
this data out of here
Straight ahead is the RIVER Chugging up the river a PARTY
BARGE

PARTYGOERS in formal attire dance to an orchestra A
SWIMMING POOL is in the middie of the deck for a perfect
water landing

STERLING
Time for a slow boat to China

He hits a BUTTON
EXT COBBLESTONE STREET - NIGHT

The rear license plate folds down revealing a ROCKET ENGINE
Flames spew as he jams down the accelerator

Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the G-forces

SPARKS fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at
ever increasing speed

Anders FIRES with his gun but Sterling is getting away
But then KIRILL steps around the corner Hes academic
looking a CHAIN SMOKING intellectual with COKE-BOTTLE
GLASSES Hes also a highly proficient and cold-blooded
SNIPER

Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE LAUNCHER from his shoulder

The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes AIRBORNE It
ROCKETS through the air towards the party barge

We see the car REFLECTED in Kirill’s glasses as he AIMS

On a little SCREEN we see the missile launcher HOME IN on the
HEAT SOURCE of the jet engine

The missile locks-in and FIRES

HEATSEEKER POV - we see a GREEN CAR with all its hot spots
GLOWING RED Camera ROARS towards the flying car

INT ASTON-MARTIN -— FLYING - NIGHT
Sterling sees the missile streaking at hinm

STERLING
Oh bloody hell
EXT THE RIVER - NIGHT
WHOOMPH The Aston-Martin EXPLODES in mid-air

Partygoers shriek as the AXLE and FLAMING RIMS rain down cn
the deck

Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear PUFFS IT

Finally Sterlings flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands
on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD
BUFFET

CUT TO
EXT WASHINGTON DC

A STRAFING SHOT over the city We make a sudden left turn
and SPEED OUT OF TOWN

We shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA In
the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK
BUILDINGS

INT UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Inside its modern cold and high tech An elevator COUNTS
DOWN to a deep basement level

The doors open and a TALL MAN man with a PROSTHETIC LEG

strides down the empty hall AGENT GIBBONS is African-

American a battle-scarred WARRIOR Even with a limp he
looks sturdy confident deadly

At the end of the hall is a METAL DOOR
INT ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - NIGHT

GIBBONS

life

SAM TANNICK

GIBBONS

lot of firepower Its only a

matter of time before they figure
out how to deploy Silent Night

on our hands

SAM TANNICK
Silent Night in the hands of a
bunch of impertinent cowboys

GIBBONS

Those CIA boys couldnt find a
clown in a field of cactus Let me
take care of it

SAM TANNICK
How will you fix it

GIBBONS
Ill go in with a team But first

coming One of their own
SAM TANNICK
So youll dredge the bottom again
Youve done that before The
results were uneven

GIBBONS
You wanna find out about rats ask

Gibbons snaps on the giant FLATSCREEN on Sams desk He
starts cycling through PHOTO AFTER PHOTO of TOUGH LOOKING
MEN

GIBBONS (CONTD)
The usual prospects Convicts
contract killers mercs

SAM TANNICK
The scum of the Earth

GIBBONS

SAM TANNICK

One Guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle SWINGS DOWN
from the ceiling TAGGING KIM IN THE FACE He falls back
TASERING another Guard

Jacket Man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the
chaos before the Guards know what hit them Theres a CURVY
PIECE OF ART in the room some kind of modern art statue

Jacket Man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a
TABLETOP AERIAL over a DIVIDER He hits the ground
pedalling the Guards hot after him

in the middle He bunny hops onto a desk and SLIDES TO A
STOP He tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him

heavily cut even dangerous looking

The Guards charge at him and he HOPS up onto the top of the

FEET TALL

He pedals across the top of the cubicle wall the Guards
scrambling after him

Xander bunny hops over one guy’s head onto the next set of
cubicles and pedals hard The Guards fall all over
themselves trying to catch him

At the other end Xander catches air and lands on a CONFERENCE
TABLE He does a WHEELIE across its length with Guards
closing in

Xander springs up and does a TAIL WHIP knocking them back
with his rear wheel He lands and pedals to the stairwell
untouched

EXT THE ROOF - NIGHT

Xander bursts out of the stairwell to the top of the TALLEST
BUILDING IN DOWNTOWN LA He climbs on a RAISED PLATFORM
From here he can drop down onto another level that is strewn
with SATELLITE DISHES and MICROWAVE RELAYS

Guards rush onto the roof and try to corral him

Xander tears off his jacket revealing a BACKPACK on his back
and VIDEO CAMERA on his chest He pulls out a ROAD FLARE and
SPARKS IT We see there are SOAKED RAGS tied to his SPOKES

CAMERAS OUT and start filming

He spins through the air his bike on fire Hes doing end
over end backflips One Two Three Four

Hes looping through space on his bike a crazy man on a
flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and
night lights

The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander’s

plummets towards the ground

At the last moment he throws out a bucket and his PARACHUTE

GIBBONS
Looks like a diner

XANDER
Diner huh Let me tell you what
the problem is I wake up drugged
to find what Youve got a
salesman over here reading a
three week old newspaper Hes
pulling a 211 with a “trucker” who
happens to be packing a cop issue
HandK 9mm I get tipped that
something is going down when she
passes me a note Hows that for
twisted logic How did she know
there was trouble unless they
pulled the guns before I walked
in And if thats true why’d they
stop and wait until I woke up to
gaffle the money Then I notice
how beefy they both are Hell
even the waitress is cut All
three of them look like they went
through the same training program
Ergo they aint strangers and this
isnt what it seems Thats how I
knew yo-yo wouldnt get a round off
even if I gave him all day Why

XANDER (contd)
Cuz theres nothing but blanks in
these guns And no offense but
their performances were terrible

GIBBONS -
Not bad Not bad at all Havea
seat

Shes startled but

Xander sits across from him

Gibbons gives a sly

In

the background the Waitress helps the Trucker and Salesman

up

GIBBONS (CONTD)
Most guys we ran through this
either took off or helped them rob
the place I expected you to do
the same
C)

ST

XANDER
That shows me already that you
dont have a clue Whats it to

you anyway

GIBBONS
Whether you thought this was for
real or not you jumped in and
helped the waitress on instinct
That tells me something about your
character

XANDER
Good for you Now why dont you
stop wasting my time and tell me
what you want You didnt go
through all this for my benefit

GIBBONS
Its your lucky day You just
might get the chance to pay back
our wonderful country for all the
freedom you enjoy

XANDER
A Fed I shoulda known Who else
would have this kind of budget
Now you’re gonna hit me with the
sales pitch

GIBBONS
Alright Cage youve got me This
is one of those moments Many are

called few are chosen that kind
of thing Your government needs
you Are you up for the challenge

XANDER
If youre trolling around for «
narks man have you got the wrong
guy

GIBBONS
Why is that

XANDER
Look at me dude do I look like a
fan of law enforcement Forget the
tests you shoulda just asked me
I woulda saved you a lot of
trouble

GIBBONS
Oh I dont know 1 think the tests
work pretty well Sometimes they
give me answers you wouldn’t admit
to in a million years

XANDER

nothing on me So if you aint

booking me Im walking

GIBBONS
Youve got this wrong Youre not

haircut can get one of those tin
stars and suddenly they think

GIBBONS
(smiles )

the assholes that pass the tests

Theres a POP and Xander clutches his stomach Gibbons
tosses his DART GUN onto the table Xander blinks at him

He pulls another CHROME DART from his gut and examines it

up looking at each other Xander chuckles

VIRG

The three laugh realizing theyre all in the same boat

TJ

They quiet down as they notice for the first time THEY ARE
NOT ALONE

Sitting silently on benches facing them are SOLDIERS DRESSED
IN BLACK They wear BLACK MASKS over their faces They are
a nasty looking BLACK OPS TEAM

One of the Soldiers opens the JUMP DOOR The rest of the
team advances on Xander Virg and TJ

VIRG

They drag Virg to the door and THROW HIM OUT TJ goes
next kicking and fighting

Then they turn on Xander

XANDER

Xander jumps out on his own

We see him tumbling away from the airplane Far below his
chute BLOSSOMS OPEN

EXT A FIELD - TWILIGHT
We see three chutes coming down The first two HIT HARD
We ROCKET IN on the last chute as Xander lands like a pro

The other guys run up to him Then they hear SHOUTING in
SPANISH

VIRG
Jee-zus man What the hell now
Another damn test

TJ

XANDER
Dont look at me brother Its
every man for himself

They wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as
they TAKE OFF IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

Xander runs low down a culvert Theres SHOUTING all around
He flattens down and crawls up over the rise What he sees
stuns him

XANDER (CONTD)
You gotta be kidding me

We crane up to reveal A FIELD OF POT PLANTS Theres a
COCAINE PROCESSING PLANT along the field’s edge The whole
place looks exactly like a Central American DRUG FARM
NARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47s

Xander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING
A squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move

He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the
HEADLIGHTS of a truck

Narcos hop out and charge forward
Xander raises his hands
XANDER (contd)

You boys are too good for me

Guess I failed this one huh
They grab him and haul him away
INT TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT
We see a RUSTY MEAT HOOK A CHAIN is wrapped around it
Attached to the chain his arms over his head is Xander
Hes in the middle of a bleak looking room There are
BLOODSTAINS on the wooden walls the floor strewn with filthy
HAY

Behind him against the wall Xander sees TJ and Virg both
HOG-TIED

XANDER
So much for ‘“every man for
himself Nice to see you again

TJ

up

VIRG
Check the table in the corner

Then they hear talking outside and the door is UNLOCKED

A very nasty looking Marco comes in By his look hes the
LEADER

XANDER (contd)
This must be el jefe Hows it

Narco Guards bring in one of their PARACHUTES and toss it on
the floor They exit closing the door behind them

Jefe goes to the table throws back the towel Beneath it are
HIDEOUS BLOOD ENCRUSTED TORTURE DEVICES a HACK SAW a BOLT
CUTTERS KNIVES CHISELS a BLOW TORCH

XANDER (contd)
What’s on the menu tonight The
old blowtorch-to-the-family jewels
routine Ill bet Hey you want
roasted nuts lets break out the
Planters

TJ and Virg both crack up Jefe gives them a withering
look

JEFE
Do you know what we do with people
come round here You know what we
do with people come in our
business

Jefe passes his hand over the various tools He finally
settles on a crude MACHETE He walks amongst them
brandishing it

JEFE (CONTD)
We cut the Achilles tendon Your
feet flop around like a marionette
You ain’t walkin nowhere no more
Sound good tough guy Or maybe
instead you wanna tell me

A low THUMPING is heard outside Its the sound of
approaching HELICOPTERS lots of them

Then the night ERUPTS in GUNFIRE It sounds like a full
scale assault outside

JEFE (CONTD)
Whats that eh I thought you
didnt have no friends

Jefe goes into a fury He SWINGS his machete at Xander’s
legs

Xander JUMPS UP grabbing on to the chain above and KICKS
Jefe in the chest

Jefe falls back and Xander climbs up to the roof BEAM

He grabs onto the beam with his legs and UNHOOKS his chain
from the meat hook

He drops down six feet of chain still hanging from his
cuffed wrists and Jefe comes charging at him

Xander dodges a few wild swings

He grabs Jefes PANT CUFF and dumps him on his ass

Jefe scrambles to his feet drawing his PISTOL

Xander swings his chain and WHIPS the gun out of Jefes hand

With another swing he WRAPS the chain around Jefes neck and
pulls it taught

XANDER
Keys You got ‘em

Jefe nods choking and reaches into his pocket

XANDER (contd)
Hand ‘em to me

Instead Jefe hurls them out the window
XANDER (cont’d)
I hope you’ re getting paid extra
for this

Xander jerks the chain slamming Jefe head first into the
wall Jefe drops knocked out

Outside it sounds like a full scale FIREFIGHT Xander gets
the machete and CUTS the ropes holding TJ and Virg

Then a HAIL OF BULLETS sprays through the room
All three guys hit the deck but TJ gets shot He clutches
his side BLOOD all over his hands
Im hit Im hit
VIRG
Theyre shooting for real This is
all real

Xander knows this is true

XANDER

Virg bolts for the door

XANDER

EXT DRUG FARM - NIGHT
Narcos are shouting running to and fro

TRACER ROUNDS cut through the air They are trying to repel
an UNSEEN ASSAULT FORCE

Overhead SIX MILITARY HELICOPTERS buzz the compound like
Apocalypse Now their NIGHT SUNS lighting up the place

Xander comes out of the torture building holding TJ ina
fireman’s carry His hands are still CUFFED the length of
chain dragging

Xander crouches behind some equipment putting TJ on the
ground

XANDER
You alright

TJ
I used to be a SEAL its not the
first time Ive been shot Thanks

XANDER
Keep your head down Ill be right
back Im gonna steal us some
wheels

Xander moves on finds cover under the camouflage netting

He can see Narcos shooting into the trees at the UNSEEN
ENEMY

Looking the other way he spots Virg running back his way
Hes been corralled by one of the Helicopters

He’s zigzagging trying to stay out of the beam of its Night
Sun

Xander darts out and GRABS him pulling him under the
camouflage netting

VIRG
Theyre all over the place What
the hells going on

XANDER
Looks like were in the middle of
the drug war

The Helicopter BEAM lights up the camouflage netting
Theyre pinned down

XANDER (CONTD)
Alright Mr free-for-all you go
that way Im gonna go this way
They cant follow us both

They squat down in runners stances the helicopter kicking up
DUST all around them

XANDER (contd)
Go

They jet off in opposite directions

Xander books running for all hes worth His cuffed hands
and the dangling chain make it difficult

Hes heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS
Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out

XANDER (contd)
Shit

The CHOPPER swoops down after him
Its big GATLING GUNS turn aiming right at him

BRAAAAAAAAPPP The guns cut loose tearing up the ground
right behind him

Xander sprints the chopper after him like Cary Grant in
North By Northwest except instead of corn fields Xander’s
running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS

Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him

Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the
plants

All around him its a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE

Two choppers attack the factory building BLASTING it with
their guns Narcos run terrified

Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front
of him He SNAPS IT OFF

XANDER (CONTD)
Im gonna need to hit the trees
after a night like this

He tucks it into his shirt and takes off through the POT
FOREST

Xander finally spots a vehicle Its a TRUCK LADEN WITH
BAILS OF COCAINE He heads for it

Then the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings
around The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around
him

Xander hauls ass heading for the truck

Bullets chew up the dirt all around him

As the helicopter passes overhead its guns RAKE THE TRUCK

There is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up

WHOOOOPPHH A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts
into the night air

Xander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH He tumbles down into
FILTHY WATER

A powdery cloud washes over him dusting the trees white

Near him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage Xander crawls
inside

The Chopper makes another pass overhead
The big spotlight plays over the area then moves on

Xander gives a sigh of relief He crawls out of the
drainpipe

JEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN
flood the compound Theres no going back

Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line

The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now Things are
quieter here and he starts to relax Bad idea

As he goes by one of the TREES moves

He takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on
EXPLODES UPWARDS ARMS reach out tackling Xander from
behind

Another TEAM of BLACK OPS SOLDIERS bursts from the weeds the
bushes all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape
l

They fall on him like a curtain

XANDER’S POV - Soldiers hold him down while a BLACK HOOD
is pulled over his head

FADE TO BLACK
INT AIRPLANE HANGER - DAY

As the MASSIVE HANGER DOORS CLOSE we can see CHOPPERS taking
off and landing MEXICAN SOLDIERS load Jefe and his Narcos

onto a FEDERALE BUS Virg resists and is BEATEN TJ can

be seen being loaded into an AMBULANCE

The hanger doors slide shut with a THUD
We see Xander’s HANDS as the CHAINS are cut away

Xander sits in a chair with the BLACK HOOD still over his
head He blinks when the hood is torn off A Black Ops
Soldier smirks as he walks away

Xander looks around sees the Black Ops Team unpacking some
STRANGE GEAR Two of them are dumping bottles of a CLEAR
LIQUID into a RUSTY CLAWFOOT BATHTUB

XANDER
Nice of you to draw me a bath Is
it Saturday already

The Black Ops guys grin knowingly

On the other side Xander sees a FLIGHT CREW readying a
GULFSTREAM for travel Gibbons steps up from behind him

GIBBONS
Congratulations youve just
graduated at the head of your
class

XANDER
Youre a cold piece of work You
almost got three people killed out
there

GIBBONS
Good thing you were there to save
the day Come walk with me

Xander gets up and Gibbons leads him on a stroll around the
hanger
GIBEONS (contd)

Youve really got me confused
Cage On the one hand you showed
leadership courage under fire a
willingness to protect men you
hardly knew and on the other you
have an arrest record that pegs you
as near sociopathic Help me out
here Im not following your
evolution

XANDER

You want the cheap backstory The
runaway mom the suicide dad and
the foster homes Gimme a break
Youre not interested in my past
you’re interested in my future as
some kind of spy

GIBBONS

Youre perceptive too I forgot to
add that to the list of surprises
Im with the National Security
Agency And unlikely as it may
sound I need your help

XANDER

Im not interested Ive already
got a job

GIBBONS

Youre an adrenaline junkie with
one foot in the penitentiary You
risk your ass building a daredevil
myth that means nothing and you’ re
not getting any younger

XANDER

I plan on getting a lot older And
playing spy games sounds like a
quick way to get yourself dead

GIBBONS

Thats too bad I thought a guy
like you would appreciate the
challenge

As they walk by the Black Ops guys

getting busy

One spreads out a plastic DROPCLOTH

plugs in a BONE SAW

Xander sees theyre

Another
XANDER
Whats this Youre gonna try to
scare me now

Gibbons grabs a CHICKEN LEG from a guy eating lunch

GIEBONS
Do you know the reason why I try to
recruit guys like you There’s no
risk

He tosses it into the tub Instantly it starts to SIZZLE and
BUBBLE The tub is full of ACID

GIBBONS (contd)
Theres nobody back home whos
gonna ask questions if you just
disappear for a while

In seconds the entire leg has been consumed leaving only a
oily cloud of residue

Gibbons eyes him coldly nailing the point home

XANDER
Now Im the one whos nauseous So
whats the deal What do you need
me for

GIBBONS

Theres some folks I want to keep
tabs on Dirty tattooed
uncivilized Your kind of people

XANDER
What do I get out of it

GIBBONS —
If you find out what I want toe
know and if Im able to
successfully use that information
you get to go back to your
degenerate little life If not
you take a bath

XANDER
Youre one sick bastard A sadist
with a badge looking to rope me in
to a suicide mission I think no
matter which way I go Im likely to
wind up face down on a sheet of
plastic So heres my answer kiss
my ass Hop-along

Gibbons kicks the back of Xander’s leg and dumps him on his
ass Gibbons was so quick Xander never saw it coming

The Black Ops guys clap and cheer always interested in a
fight

XANDER (contd)
Not bad for a gimp

GIBBONS
What’s with that “X” on the back of
your head Does that mean youre
extreme Ive got some news for
you Mr X youre a three time
loser So maybe you should tattoo
another couple of Xs on your head

Xander gets up

XANDER
Ill take that under advisement
Maybe I can be like you and lose a
leg for the old Stars and Bars I
bet the flag’s a great comfort
every time you need help climbing
stairs

Gibbons lunges and grabs Xander’s throat in the vice-like
grip of his thumb and middle finger

GIBBONS
One twitch and my finger and thumb
will meet inside your esophagus
Believe me Mr X Ive put foot to
ass for my country on many
occasions and I dont feel the urge
to stop just yet So think
carefully before you tell me Is
“kiss my ass Hop-along your final
answer

The fingers are so powerful that Xander is paralysed He
looks over sees the bone saw start revving

XANDER
(choking)
No

Gibbons releases his grip

GIBBONS
I thought you might see it my way

Then Xander starts walking away

GIBBONS (CONTD)
Where you going X I said where

The Black Ops guys grab weapons ready to stop him

One of the metal boxes has been dropped by a Cop The rest

are spread out in front of Xander

GADGETS laid into the molded carbon fiber lining

XANDER

The metal ball unrolls into a six legged ROBOT INSECT

SHAVERS (contd)
An all-terrain mobile video
monitoring system for surveillance

SHAVERS
Terminator climbing claws

He CLAMPS the claw onto the metal case It holds fast

SHAVERS (cont’ d)
Miniature power cams set in on

He tosses the glove aside pulls out a DART GUN

SHAVERS

the grounds

Xander aims at the shooting range

BINOCULAR POV - we see through the clothes of the FEMALE
COPS on the shooting range (PG-13 style of course) We can
even see the INNER WORKINGS of their GUNS One of the Female
Cops turns and gives Xander an approving look

XANDER
I think Ill hang on to these

SHAVERS

SHAVERS

XANDER
I thought that was in detail

As Shavers drones on Xander hangs his head
EXT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY

The TEN BLACK MARKET EUROPEAN SPORTS CARS are loaded on two
TRANSPORT TRUCKS Mafiya BODYGUARDS keep watch

He nods for Kirill to stand down
OUTSIDE - the two transport trucks are driven off by the

XANDER
Youre alright Yorgi

Next door to the warehouse sits an ABANDONED BUILDING Up on
the sloped roof Slovo spies down on the transaction He’s
got a camera with a big zoom lens

SLOVO
Smile bychara

Slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured To get
a better vantage he JUMPS DOWN onto a lower part of the
roof

CRUNCH His foot BREAKS THROUGH THE SHAEBY ROOF TILE
Down below Kirill hears the noise

KIRILL
Yorgi

They all look to the abandoned building

Through the second floor window they can see Slovo’s leg
poking through the ceiling

Xander is taken aback

YORGI
What in the hell

Yorgi turns to Xander goes for his pistol

Thinking fast Xander does the same

They draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each others
heads as they sit in the car Petra Kirill and Anders draw

as well all of them covering Xander

YORGI (contd)
Whats going on my friend

XANDER

Yorgi stares finally believes him He lowers his gun

YORGI
Get him Find out who he is

By now Slovo is down the fire escape He hits the ground and
goes running down the street

The Anarchy 99 crew heads for their cars Xander SPINS the
cylinder on his REVOLVER

XANDER

The GTO peels out
EXT STREET - DAY

Slovo is huffing and puffing as fast as he can when Xander
comes skidding around the corner He looks back and sees the
speeding GTO

YORGI
Thats the cop from the club

Xander does the only thing he can He puts the car sideways
and aims out the window as he slides to a stop

Slovo turns and BLAM Xander SHOOTS Slovo right in the
chest

IN SLOMO a spray of BLOOD erupts from his chest and Slovo
falls backwards his face frozen in a look of shock and
betrayal

The smoking shell clatters to the ground

Slovo blinks up at Xander gasping for words then lays
still

Xander hops out rifles through Slovo’s pockets The other
Anarchy 99 cars pull up the whole group looking on
Oo

YORGI (CONTD)
What are you doing Get in the
car

Xander heads back to the GTO and the cars peel out
INT GTO - MOVING - DAY
The rest of Anarchy 99 follows behind the GTO

INT NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Its a crowded basement rave club Hot and sweaty RAVERS
dance in provocative outfits The Anarchy 99 group is

standing on the best booth right on the packed dance floor

Surrounding them are a handful of MAFIYA BODYGUARDS who stand
at attention like the Secret Service

Anders swings from a water pipe and then drops onto the
table smashing glass

A DRUNK GUY tries to pull Petra onto the dance floor and she
PUNCHES him The Bodyguards drag the dude out for a proper
thrashing Yorgi shatters a BOTTLE against the wall

YORGI
Total chaos man Welcome to

YORGI
Thats what Im talking about man

Yorgi rolls up his sleeve revealing an Anarchy 99 tat (a
circled A with 99 underneath)

YORGI (contd)
To us it means no walls no speed
limits no jails Its everybody
does what he wants People think
democracy is freedom but they dont
have a clue Theres an old punk
song It says America stands for
freedom but if you think you’ re

free”

XANDER
try walking into a deli and
urinating on the cheese ‘Anarchy

Burger by the Vandals

YORGI
You got it man Its stupid but
it’s true True freedom is when
you do whatever you want anytime

XANDER
Kow you gonna do that with
government and rules everywhere

YORGI
Easy You get enough money that

whole world to kiss

Yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor The X-
ed out ravers swat it around like confetti

YORGI (CONTD)
You hang with us buddy taste some
freedom Petra Dance with this

Yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd leaving Xander alone
with Petra She gets up grumpily and starts dancing Xander
joins her but she wont even look at him

XANDER
This is great dancing with the
back of your head

She reluctantly turns around

XANDER (contd)
If you got a problem with me why
are we dancing

PETRA
Yorgi asked me to

XANDER
You do everything Yorgi says

PETRA
Go to hell

XANDER

PETRA
Mind your business

XANDER

She glares at him and walks away Xander follows

XANDER (convt’d)
Where are you going

PETRA
Why are you still hanging around
Your business is finished you
should go home

XANDER
I was invited Whats your story

PETRA
I dont know who you are or where
you come from but I dont like

Theres a big line outside the ladies and no line at the
“men’s” Petra heads into the Mens Room

Some DUDE whistles at her She pushes him out of the way and
enters a stall Xander leans on the sink

XANDER
Come on dont front like that
Youll put a guy right off you

PETRA
Dont even bother X man Im not
your type

XANDER

That right Whys that
The stall door flies open and Petra marches out

PETRA
My chest is too small and my brain
is too big

She shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall
Xander walks back out shaking his head and laughing

Across the room Viktor shoves the DJ out of the way and
puts on ANARCHY BURGER by the Vandals The rave dance is
interrupted by the pounding punk beat

YORGI
Xander check it out The
revolution begins

Viktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent
mosh pit Xander cant help it he actually likes these

guys

YORGI (cont’ d)

Yorgi and Xander head outside A moment later Kirill
hurries out another door

EXT PRAGUE RIVERFRONT - NIGHT

kid My old man was in the
service we used to live on the
Army base in Hamburg

YORGI
You an Army brat I dont see

Hell no My dad was a straight up
tin soldier Somehow he pissed

dishonorably discharged Had a
court martial and everything The
charges were total bullshit so he
was sure hed get his name cleared
but it didnt happen

YORGI
Connections and politics its the
same everywhere

XANDER
My old man he bought into the
system and it screwed him So he
swallowed a bullet Me I dont
believe in nothing I cant see and
touch

The camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city flying over
streets and houses until half a mile away it finds Kirill
in a window with his SNIPER RIFLE

POV THROUGH SCOPE - Xanders head is in the crosshairs

The scope pans over to Yorgi who looks INTO CAMERA and gives
a small signal calling off the hit

BACK ON YORGI AND XANDER
Yorgi looks up at a PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banner

YORGI
Next week these idiots are having a
Peace conference here What the
hell are they going to talk about
Its the system itself that causes
all the worlds problems Youre

slams the door Xander scratches his head and picks a room
The others shuffle off to their beds with their Strippers

INT MEDIEVAL MANOR - XANDER’S ROOM - SUNRISE

Flak Jacket is out of sight in the bathroom Xander talks to

He trails off as she steps out of the bathroom Shes
wearing just a G-string and the flak jacket

XANDER (contd)
You dont understand a word Im

She just smiles at him sweetly and pulls his shirt off She
looks at the ENGAGEMENT RING still pierced through his nipple
and gives a puzzled look

XANDER (contd) oe ° °
Stupid right Thats what I was

trying to tell you I just got out
of this heavy thing

She kisses him and lets the flak jacket fall (PG-13 style)

XANDER
The people I know want facts the

EXT ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY

Xander’s timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the
door a BUS passes by

Kirill keeps focussed waiting for the bus to pass

POV THROUGH SCOPE - Xander’s head is sporadically visible
through the bus windows

Kirill’s finger tightens on the trigger

As soon as the bus passes he FIRES

But Xander’s not there hes ducked down to tie his shoe
CRASH The glass door behind him shatters Feigning
surprise Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down
the block

He runs bent low the parked cars protecting him from the
sniper Kirill fires anyway taking out car windows

At the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL RAIL
down the middle

As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the
SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER sending food and drink
flying

Ke hops on the serving tray like its a skateboard and does a
RAIL-SLIDE down the length cf the stairs Hes moving too
fast for Kirill

He jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE AIR
Kirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon

By now Xander is out of sight Kirill pounds his rifle in
frustration

Petra gets to the top of the stairs She gives Kirill a
Where did he go look Her nose is bloody helping to sell
her performance

Then she turns and looks off after Xander She sees his GTO
speeding away

FADE TO
EXT NORWEGIAN FJORDS - LATE AFTERNOON

Were looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord seen
from high above Its towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it An
airplane No were at the top of the Trollveggen Norways
legendary Troll Wall Its a near 5000 foot sheer drop to
the ocean

Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff They wear
webbed “squirrel” jumpsuits helmets and parachutes On each
thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have

silenced MP-5 sub-machine guns Together they stare down at
the ship
Petra is among them She looks down at her watch It is

precisely 559PM She glances around The top of the cliff
is rocky and flat Xander is nowhere to be seen

FIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military
style Hes got his stakeout suit on and is keeping low

He checks his watch 6 PM

The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and without
saying a word they leap off the Troll Wall

Xander runs to the edge and looks down He sees the group
freefalling down the sheer cliff face
74

XANDER
Very nice

The six plummet away from him at incredible speed In a hard
arch they peak at 120 mph

Then using the webbed wings under their arms and between
their legs they go into aerodynamic track positions and
rocket away from the wall

Like dark angels they soar out over the water in formation

ON THE SHIP BELOW -

The ship below is a scientific research vessel On the deck
a few SAILORS and SCIENTISTS watch the sun set

The six dark figures close in rapidly

At the last moment they pull their chutes and deftly glide
towards the ship

A sailor looks up and spots them
Before he can shout hes SHOT IN THE LEG and goes down
Seconds later theyre on the deck tearing off their rigs

They race across the deck taking over the ship in a surgical
manner They herd everyone back heading for the bridge

Petra hangs back She looks back at the cliff up towards
Xander

XANDER’S POV

Through his SUPER BINOCULARS we see them storming the bridge
As they head inside they disappear from view

Xander hits a button on the side of the binoculars

XANDER (contd)
Lets see whats going on inside

“PENETRATOR” POV
Now he can see THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE SHIP

He sees THE CREW herded into a room and LOCKED IN by Anarchy

INT SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

Anarchy 99 seals the door locking the crew away They slap
five and bump chests still totally amped up

EXT SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

ANGLE ON - a LARGE SUBMERSIBLE VEHICLE Its white and
twelve feet long There are MOTORS on either side and a
PANEL OF SOLAR CELLS on the top of a periscope-like
projection rising from the back

This is the AHAB DEVICE It sits in the WET WELL at the back
of the ship ready to be launched out the back sea doors

YORGI
Ready the boat

There is a SMALLER BOAT moored to the back of the ship
Kirill and Viktor hop onto its deck They start to WHISTLE
as they work Sounds like the Andy Griffith theme

XANDERS BINOCULARS POV
He takes DIGITAL PHOTOS of the Ahab device

XANDER
What the hell are you guys
stealing

BACK ON THE SHIP

The smaller boat is launched and ready to do Yorgi goes to
the WET WELL CONTROLS and hits a switch

The aft doors open letting water into the wet well In
seconds Ahab starts to float Anders loosens it from its
moorings and they TIE AHAB TO THE BACK OF THE SMALLER ‘BOAT

KIRILL
Ready

Yorgi hits another switch opening the BALLAST DOORS on the
port side of the ship Air flows out causing the ship to
list to one side

PETRA
What are you doing

YORGI
It all happened so fast Suchan
unfortunate accident

Yorgi MACHINE GUNS the wet well control panel

YORGI (contd)
Lets go

They climb onto the boat Petra is the last to board She

looks up towards Xander and MACHINE GUNS the panel some more
making sure he notices

XANDER‘S POV

He sees the smaller boat pulling away the Ahab device being
towed behind He pans over and ZOOMS IN on the shot-up
control panel

XANDER
What the hell

He pans over to the wet well and sees its flooding

With the ballast open on only one side the ship starts
LISTING The thing is going down

He pans over clicks into penetrator mode and sees the
Crew pounding on the walls below decks Theyre trapped
their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS
EXT TOP OF TROLL WALL - LATE AFTERNOON
Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up
XANDER
No way man no way Im just
supposed to be an observer Aw
shit This job sucks
He pats his jumpsuit checking for the buckle
XANDER (contd)
Toby Lee Shavers if this thing
dont work your ass is kicked
Xander steels himself takes a few deep breaths
Then he sprints to the edge and JUMPS off the cliff
And thats it Hes gone One mile straight down

Suddenly were falling with him

We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from
the craggy rock face

The force of the wind ripples his cheeks

He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away
from the cliff like Superman

Before he gets too low he RIPS THE BUCKLE

Immediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE
LAYERS unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL

Xander looks up at his parasail relieved and glides towards
the ship

EXT SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON

Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi
from spotting it She grabs him suddenly and KISSES him

YORGI
What was that for

PETRA
Id forgotten how exciting it is
working together

YORGI
Youve been so quiet lately Petra
I thought you no longer cared

PETRA

Why dont we go below decks and
work off some of this adrenaline

YORGI
(smiles )
Viktor Stay the course
Yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below

EXT SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander comes in for a perfect landing He lands on the
listing deck and undoes his harness

He sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck

XANDER
Son of a bitch

He looks across the water sees the smaller boat far away

EXT SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON

Petra looks back one last time catching sight of Xander on
the deck of the ship She smiles relieved

Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the
price

EXT SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in
With the ship listing like this the water is pouring below
decks

INT SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold Here
is where the entire Crew has been left to drown They are
struggling to stay above water their hands and feet bound

As the far end of the room is another HATCH Water pours in
from this one and Xander has to get it shut

He swims through the struggling Crew spots the CAPTAIN
holding his YOUNG SON above water The water is rising
rapidly filling up the compartment

Xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and PUSHES but
the force of the water is too much

He surfaces Hes got to wait until the room floods before
he can close that door

He watches as the Crew goes into a panic the water rising up
to the ceiling They are gasping in the last foot of air
thats available He sees the Captains Son crying and
clutching at his father

Xander takes a deep breath and dives down He grabs the
hatch door braces his feet and PULLS

His muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings
SHUT

Xander surfaces and swims to the ladder He CUTS the
Captains plastic cuffs

XANDER
Is the boy alright

CAPTAIN
Yes I will cut the others loose
you must run the bilge pumps

The Captain takes the knife and swims to free his men
Xander takes the Captains Son and climbs up the ladder

EXT SHIPS BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Xander scans the controls but has no idea what hes looking
for The Captains Son shows him the right switch

XANDER
You sure

The Son nods and Xander flips the switch MOTORS start to
HUM

EXT SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON

The bilge pumps spew out water furiously Crew members come
up from below decks They are soaked and grateful They go
about tending to the wounded as Xander slumps down next to
the exhausted Captain

XANDER
Captain huh You get a lot of
broads with that uniform

They both laugh relieved as the ship slowly rights itself
FADE TO

Laid out below he can see the AHAB DEVICE hanging from
chains TECHIES are working with the Anarchy 99 crew to
RETROFIT the thing

They are installing a LAUNCHER RACK of TEN TUBES

Xander cant hear a thing through the thick glass

He takes a METAL BALL from his pocket Theres a sink in the
corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain

INT DRAIN PIPE
We follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and
down into the wall The pipe zigzags around like a

rollercoaster and then levels off

The ball rolls past a T-intersection stops and unrolls like
a pill bug

Six metal legs appear and we see its the ROACH CAM It
scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn

INT MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

her legs in a punked-out CATHOLIC SCHOOL GIRL SKIRT

He smiles enjoying himself

XANDER
Great piece of hardware

He plugs his earpiece in and listens in
INT MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT
Petra works on a COMPUTER CONTROLLER

The roach scurries across the floor circling to get a better
look at Ahab

Anders pushes a CART holding TEN GLASS CANNISTERS OF LIQUID
Each cannister is separated in two with a BLACK LIQUID on
top and a WHITE LIQUID on the bottom
He hands the cannisters to Viktor one by one

ANDERS

find the opposite door locked He hides behind one of the
many COLUMNS as his pursuers enter the room

Kirill gives a thumbs up and puts on a pair of NIGHT VISION
GOGGLES He scans the big room but sees nothing

Xander hidden at the opposite end waits breathlessly

Kirill advances slowly his buddies covering him from the
door

YORGI
Xander my friend that can only be
you Why dont we put our weapons
down for a few minutes and discuss
this like friends How would you
like to come to work for us

Machine together

Across the room Xander sees a small window leading to the
courtyard He has to run across open ground to reach it He
calls out to Yorgi

XANDER
Speaking of people that are full of
shit funny you should mention
those guys

Xander’s voice echoes around the empty hall making it
impossible to pinpoint
XANDER (contd)
They put their records out through
Sony one of the biggest corporate

machines on the planet Some
revolutionaries huh

He pulls out his gun as Kirill creeps ever closer
Against the far wall Xander spots a FIRE EXTINGUISHER
YORGI
Come on youre the one whos
fooling yourself Why risk your
life for your government when we
can offer you a future that is
truly free
Kirill is almost on top of him
Xander sights up and FIRES
The fire extinguisher EXPLODES blinding Kirill

Xander makes a run for it

Everyone FIRES WILDLY (except for Petra) bullets tearing
tapestries off the walls

Xander dives and crashes through the window
EXT COURTYARD - SUNRISE
Xander tuck and rolls comes up running

Guards are running around unsure just what the hell is going

Xander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby
and fires up the engine He hits a remote switch and BLAM
The EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows up

He points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS They forma
ramp that he can use to JUMP THE WALL He GUNS THE ENGINE

A Guard races across the wall with a rifle taking aim
Xander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail As he goes by

before he can shoot

The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go

YORGI

Anders fires up the other trials bike slings a submachine
gun across his back and goes up and over Petra watches him
go hoping for the best

EXT PRAGUE STREETS - DAYBREAK

(NOTE action will be rechoreographed based on actual
locations Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated
by a physical reason)

Xander blazes down the street Anders racing right behind
him A wrong turn sends him into a dead end

At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall
Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of the
truck and onto its roof Balancing on the rear wheel he
hops onto the wall

The machine gun blasts again Xander drives off along the
top of the wall Anders shoulders his gun and follows

They are riding a 15 high wall thats only a foot wide
They make several 90 degree turns racing above a sleeping
neighborhood Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and

takes a detour

He hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER
CONSTRUCTION

INT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING

CONSTRUCTION WORKERS bolt out of the way as the motorcycle
leaps into their building

Xander pops a wheelie and slams through a BLUEPRINT TABLE
Anders follows demolishing their SNACK TABLE

Xander darts through the building between beams and 2 x 4s
until he reaches a skeletal STAIRCASE
More WORKERS appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander
goes up He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes
onto the roof

EXT THE ROOFTOPS - MORNING

Xander looks around for a way out The next building isnt
that for away He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS

Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and
follows Xander

They jump from roof to roof down a DESCENDING SERIES OF
ROOFTOPS towards the river Anders pulls up alongside as
they race towards that last apartment building

Neck and neck they head for the brink At the last jump
Xander pulls up behind Anders

They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel Anders clamps
on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop Xander right
behind him

They skid to a stop at the very edge with Anders balanced on
his front wheel He looks down sees street five stories
below

He glances back at Xander sweat beading struggling to keep
his balance Xander observes him coolly totally in control

Anders reaches for his machine gun Xander pops a wheelie
and RAMS Anders over the edge

The bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement Anders
tears through several AWNINGS before slamming into the
ground

Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building

He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually
take him to street level

As he makes his way down Anders stirs The guy is a bloody
broken mess but he gets to his feet He sees where Xander is
headed and he scurries off to intercept him

EXT ALLEY - MORNING

Xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley The
only way out is fenced in But theres a RAMP leading up to
a LOADING DOCK Xander will have to use that ramp to jump
the fence

Anders climbs to the second floor of the building fThere is
a small crane arm loaded with metal If he pushes it at the
right time it will swing out and knock Xander from his bike
He giggles maniacally blood dripping

Xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump
Anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out

IN SLOW MOTION The bike leaves the ramp and soars up over
the fence

The crane arm swings out on a collision course with Xander

Xander sees it and THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE BIKE grabbing onto
the back in a SUPERMAN SEAT-GRAB He passes RIGHT UNDERNEATH
the swinging crane arm

Anderss face falls when he sees Xander go by hanging on
with ONE HAND In his OTHER HAND Xander’s got his PISTOL
BLAP

Xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands He stops
sees Anders BLOODY HELMET come bouncing into the alley He
tucks his pistol away and roars off

INT DIRTY APARTMENT — DAY

PETRA

Xander kisses her

XANDER
That gives us something to live
for

Together they walk back across the bridge We crane up
revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big
BUILDING on the river

EXT MOUNTAIN - DAY

We see a craggy gnarly mountain The front side is a rock
strewn near vertical drop

Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side Hes
got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like its been a
helluva climb

Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath Its
beautiful up here

He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back hits a switch
and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size He clamps it on
his feet

Xander moves to the edge and peers down At the bottom of
the mountain he can see the CASTLE an imposing medieval
fortress in the snow He leans over the edge and starts down
the mountain

He doesnt get far before he notices something else He
slides to a stop on the near vertical face clinging to rocks
for balance

On the mountain below him between him and the castle is a
GUARD OUTPOST Right now hes in full view and hes been
spotted He sees GUARDS scrambling out hopping on
SNOWMOBILES From up here they look like ants

EXT GUARD OUTPOST - DAY
Viktor the goateed cold weather warrior strides out of the
Outpost and looks up the mountain He shouts orders to his

men

A Guard runs up and brings him his weapon A FLAME-THROWER
Viktor straps it on and climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE

All around him the Guards are driving into position They ¢
form a gauntlet of AK-47s There must be a DOZEN of them

Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits his engine idling

VIKTOR
Hold positions

He squints up at the speck that is Xander
EXT MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY
Xander pulls a CONCUSSION GRENADE from his jacket

XANDER
Nothing like fresh powder

He puts his goggles on and pulls the pin from the grenade
Then he TOSSES IT OVER HIS SHOULDER

The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts ROLLING
DOWNHILL TOWARDS HIM Xander pushes off and starts bombing
down the mountain

The grenade bounces after him and then WHAM It goes up with
a tremendous shock

There is a SHIFT in the snow a GROAN of shifting weight
then the ENTIRE CORNICE cracks loose and topples over the
brink

Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at
his heels

From down below its an awesome sight The slack-jawed
Guards watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them

Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer they
can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face

Theres a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and
ride for their lives A furious Viktor spins around and
makes a run for it as well

Nobody has a chance The avalanche is coming like a freight
train frothing like white water

Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a
JUMP He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof
of the Outpost

The avalanche is right behind him slamming down everything
and everyone in its way

Guards are swallowed up and tossed snowmobiles go tumbling
under the onslaught

Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over
the Outpost He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a
stop

Then its all quiet

Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble Theres
nothing moving up there anymore Xander pulls himself free

Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE
he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME Its Viktor and his
flame thrower Theres another SPURT and the glow fades for
good

Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath Hes
right above the Castle now Then his communicator starts to
BEEP

XANDER (CONTD)
(into communicator)
Gibbons long time no talk You
wouldnt believe my day

INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS ON THE PRIVATE JET WITH A TEAM OF
AGENTS

Silent Night mean anything to
you

GIBBONS

Yes it does

XANDER
Come on Gibbons you can do better
then that

GIBBONS

Silent Night is the name of a top
secret binary nerve agent The
glass cannister is shot into the
air and detonated The black and
white chemicals mix forming a
toxic cloud “When it settles down
to Earth itll kill everything in
the vicinity

XANDER
Jesus Christ Gibbons this is
something we came up with

GIBBONS
Yeah thats right So now that
you know you understand why its
important that we get it back

” XANDER

Xander’s hangs up and heads down the hill
EXT CASTLE - DAY

A GUARD patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle He
stops for a smoke when Xander walks right up to him

WHACK With two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps
walking Hes a man on a mission

He runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall Theres
no hand-holds it’s a perfectly flat climb A canyon of
ROCKS is below

Xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the TERMINATOR
CLIMBING CLAWS He pulls on the metal gloves and CLAWS into
the solid rock

Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface

We see him outlined against the mountains steadily making
this impossible climb

At the top is an overhang Its a gnarly transition As
hes rounding it his FEET SLIP His legs dangle over the
rocky chasm below

Using all his strength he pulls himself up the rest of the
way with his climbing claws

At the top a GUARD leans over aiming his gun at him Xander
grabs him and pulls him over the edge

The Guard FALLS into the chasm

Xander rolls onto the parapet exhausted Then another GUARD
rushes him grabbing for his rifle

Xander springs the claws lashing out and tears the gun from
his hands With the other hand he SLASHES taking the Guard
down

He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower

INT CASTLE -—- COURTYARD - DAY

Xander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level

As he crosses the courtyard an EXPLOSION rocks the tower he
just left

There is shouting as GUARDS race around the parapets unsure
where the attack is coming from A GUARD runs up to Xander

GUARD
(in Russian)
Whats going on

Xander CLOTHESLINES him and catches his AK-47 as he drops

Up inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window Yorgi
appears mildly shocked as they make EYE CONTACT

Xander takes aim

POV on XANDER thru SNIPER SCOPE

From up above Kirill has Xander in his sights

BLAW The bullet hits Xander’s AK sending it spinning

Xander rubs his sore hand but stays put Kirill could have
killed him and he knows it From a doorway comes Yorgi with
some Guards

Yorgi walks up and SMASHES Xander in the face

YORGI
That was for Anders

XANDER
Dont forget goatee boy I greased
him up on the diamond run

Yorgi punches him again
INT CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

Petra sits at a desk working on a LAPTOP Yorgi enters with
Xander and Kirill

YORGI

Petra looks up She can barely hide her shock

YORGI (CONTD)
Petra my sweet dove do you notice

Kirill aims his gun at Petra

PETRA

Yorgi SLAPS her

YORGI

you all along My contacts in the
KGB told me you were coming You
show up undercover and I must
admit you play your part to the
hilt When its time to be cruel
you are cruel

(MORE )

YORGI (contd)
When its time to be passionate
you are very very passionate
indeed

Petra is devastated by this revelation

YORGI (contd)
I could have killed you but I
thought this would be so much more
fun To twist you and use you how
I see fit And to be honest you
went much farther than I ever
expected you would for your
country

He runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to Xander

YORGI (CONTD)
And you Why do you have such a
problem staying away my friend
Did you miss us that much

XANDER
I wanted to get the hell out of
Prague before Silent Night falls

YORGI
Not bad man not bad You put
things together quick Prague it
is

PETRA
The Peace conference

YORGI
Nice place to start dont you
think

XANDER

Whats the gimmick Yorgi Thats
the part I dont get You gonna
hold the world hostage with your
gas bombs I didnt think you were
dumb enough to go with that hack
cliche

YORGI
You think Im after money I told
you my friend Anarchy Time for
a change Money is good but for
¢ true freedom you have to get rid of
the rules themselves
-01

XANDER
So all by yourself youre going to
destroy every government in the

world

YORGI
Easier than that buddy Ill get
them to destroy each other You

kill an entire Peace conference
someone is going to have to pay
Then our friend Ahab continues down
the river to the ocean and begins
his world tour London Cairo
Beijing Pretty soon everyone’s
involved These guys bomb those
guys those guys invade these guys
Soon the whole world is like your
wild West cowboy days No rules
no law everybody free to do what
they want

XANDER
Including rape pillage murder

YORGI
Sure if thats what you want Why
not Its all human nature So we

just have to launch our baby and
wait for the decline and fall of
civilization as we know it

XANDER
And here I thought anarchy was
just something cool to put ona T-
shirt

YORGI
Come on Xander You used to stand
for something What happened to
you man I thought youd get it

PETRA
Dont you see X For the
betterment of humanity hes going
to start World War Three

XANDER
Hes a regular humanitarian And
all this time I thought he was just
a tool
YORGI
You both could have been a part of
it You could have ridden with us

into a new day the dawning of a
new age of--

XANDER
Oh just shoot us already Im

Yorgis eye twitches

YORGI
Screw you too buddy

He raises his gun and suddenly BOOOOOM A massive explosion
rocks the whole castle Shrapnel shatters the windows
spraying glass and Yorgis shot goes wide

EXT THE CASTLE - DAY

The front gates have just been blown apart Through the
smoke and wreckage come Ivans 1 and 2 with a PLATOON OF CRACK
CZECH SECRET POLICE Their submachine guns rattle in three-
shot bursts sweeping Guards from the parapets

INT CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

Kirill looks down at the carnage below Xander takes
advantage of the distraction and charges at Yorgi

Yorgi goes to shoot but his hand wont work Theres a HUGE
SHARD OF GLASS sticking through his forearm

By the time he pulls it out Xander is on top of him He
body checks Yorgi sending him flying over a desk Kirill
spins and starts FIRING Xander ducks for cover

EXT THE CASTLE - DAY

The Czech Secret Police are having their way They cross the
courtyard and burst into the main building

INT CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY

The Police whip through the building like lightening mowing
down everyone in their path

One Czech Secret Policeman is wounded and the others
retaliate with a volley of RPGs that evaporates a pocket of
resistance

tn the main room upstairs Kiriil is blasting away Yorgi
starts rounding up the computer gear

YORGI
Hurry up kill him

Before Kirill can do so Cops burst into the room spraying
bullets everywhere

Xander and Petra are pinned down but Yorgi and Kiriil manage
to make a fast exit out another door

XANDER
Hey Were on your side

The Cops keep shooting
EXT CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

Ivan 1 is talking on the radio when Yorgi appears behind him
and shoots him in the back

They step over him and enter a GARAGE
INT CASTLE - GARAGE - DAY

The Ahab device is in the back of a flatbed TRUCK Yorgi and
Kiriil start up the truck and jam it into gear

EXT CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

The truck smashes through the garage doors and rumbles across
the courtyard

Police open fire but the truck tears out the gate and starts
heading down the mountain

INT CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY
Meanwhile Xander and Petra are still pinned down

XANDER
Petra Tell them something

Petra starts calling out in RUSSIAN Finally the cops stop
shooting

EXT CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

Xander and Petra are brought outside They see the Police
working on the wounded Ivan 1 Ivan 2 walks up
XANDER

IVAN 2

PETRA

XANDER

torpedo with them

IVAN 2

Yes Your friend the angry one

EXT CASTLE - DAY

A big truck pulls to a stop Its ramp lowers and Xanders

blown-out ‘72 GTO comes rolling out

IVAN 2
Well be right behind you

Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols

XANDER
Did you do your homework

PETRA
(nods )
If they launch it I know how to
bring it back

XANDER
Lets do this

They both climb in and the GTO peels out
EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY
Xander drives all out trying hard to catch up

He passes several of Ivans Police Jeeps at a furious

clip
nS Up ahead they see the truck winding its way down the
mountain

XANDER
Wheres he headed

PETRA
He owns a big industrial complex on
the river Hell launch it from
there

Xander floors it

Up ahead in the flatbed truck Yorgi drives He can see the
GTO gaining on them

YORGI
(in Russian subtitled)
Theyre coming Get back there

Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab He
lays down resting the rifle on the Ahab container

As the GTO comes into view he sights up and FIRES

om WHACK The first shot goes clean through the windshield and
blows the headrest off Xander’s seat
XANDER
You get down Ill take care of
this fool

He pulls out an MP-5 out and hangs it out the window

PETRA
No Dont shoot Hes hiding
behind the nerve agent

Another shot blasts through taking off the rear-view mirror
XANDER
Goddamit He’s gonna stop playing
around soon and shoot something

valuable

Kirill laughs and takes aim once again He puts Petra in the
sights

Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM the shot goes wide

The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain
Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns

The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex
up ahead They cut across a field heading right for it
EXT OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY
The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex
Quickly the gates are closed again Armed GUARDS can be seen
up above
The GTO comes at the gates at full speed

XANDER
Lets see what my man put together

Xander opens a DASH PANEL revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES He
flips one

The HEADLIGHTS EJECT revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER
BRRRAAAAAAPPP The mini-guns spin

The metal doors are getting SHREDDED

Empty SHELLS spill down the sides of the GTO

The metal doors come apart falling in chunks

The GTO slams through the wreckage without slowing down

A Guard comes tumbling down and BOUNCES off the trunk as the
GTO zips inside

EXT INSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY
The Anarchy 99 guys seem to have a whole other army in here
Guards spill onto the road shooting at them from everywhere

A BELLY PANEL on the GTO opens and ping- pong ball sized MINI-
BOMBS dump onto the road

BLAM BLAM BLAM The bombs send the Guards scattering
The GTO sizzles away

XANDER
Where’d the damn truck go

PETRA
Go to the water its that way

A tactical (a pick-up with a 50 cal machine gun attached)
pulls up behind them and opens fire
XANDER
Toadies right behind

PETPA
Let me

Petra punches another button

The REAR HUBCAPS pop off They roll along the read on their
own Inside they seem to be LINED WITH SPIKES

As the Tactical pulls up in between the hubcaps they BLOW UP
SPRAYING SPIKES at both sides of the Tactical

All four wheels BLOW OUT and the Tactical goes out of
control

It crashes through a fence and pitches into the water the
men going sprawling

PETRA (contd)
Fantastic options

At the riverbank Yorgi and Kirill pull Ahab off the truck and
prepare for launching

They remove it from its box and carry it waist deep into the
water Yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on Ahab’s
insides

YORGI
Ive got it go Cover me

Kirill grabs his sniper rifle and heads off

He climbs up to a second story window of a wooden building on
a WHARF From here he can shoot and NOT BE SEEN He takes
his LIT CIGARETTE and tucks it behind his ear

When the GTO rounds the corner he FIRES

The bullet goes through the window and SLAMS into the
steering column

Xander jams it into reverse They retreat behind a building
Petra clutches her arm wounded

XANDER
You okay

PETRA
A piece of shrapnel hit me
XANDER
Im sick of that guy Lets stop
playing nice

Kirill chambers another bullet and waits for them to make
their second approach The GTO comes roaring out spinning
in circles wildly Xander’s is just doing donuts as fast as
he can

Kirill aims but with all the dust being kicked up he doesnt
have much of a target

KIRILL
What are you doing

He doesnt notice Petra pop up from behind a fence with a
HEAT SEEKING MISSILE LAUNCHER

ANGLE ON - the missile launchers COMPUTER SCREEN The green
display shows a faint red glow in the upstairs window Its
the GLOWING POINT of Kirill’s lit cigarette

The Launcher BEEPS as it locks in and she FIRES

Kirill looks up to see the missile blazing down the wharf at
him

He gets it immediately In a panic he fumbles for the
cigarette

Too late The missile zeroes in on his head
WHOOOSH The entire wooden shack blows apart
Xander walks up to Petra

XANDER
I guess the surgeon general was
right

ANGLE ON - Ahab as Yorgi flips a switch and lets it go The
electric motor purrs to life and Ahab zips out into the
river

Xander and Petra run to the waters edge in time to see Yorgi
escaping in a MOTORBOAT In the opposite direction they see
the ripples of Ahab as it speeds towards its destination

Petra finds the CONTROLLER in the cab of the truck She
presses buttons desperately

PETRA
He’s shut out the communication
circuit

XANDER

You cant talk to it

PETRA
No its like a safety We are
going to have to access the manual
controls

XANDER
A manual control on a moving
torpedo This day keeps getting
better and better

Xander starts running towards a second moored MOTORBOAT

XANDER (cont’d)
Radio Ivan Tell him whats going
down Have them evacuate downtown

EXT THE RIVER - DAY

Yorgi is motoring away smiling when he glances back and
sees Xander and Petra take off after Ahab He pounds on his
steering wheel and turns around His bigger boat closes on
them and he reloads his weapons

Xander drives while Petra checks her controller

PETRA
Its running three meters down
Twenty knots

XANDER
It has to surface to release the
nerve agent right

PETRA
By then its too late The only
way to safely dispose of the nerve
agent is in deep water The
chemicals will break down and
dissipate

XANDER
Use your grenades Maybe we can
blow it up underwater

They’ re heading into downtown Prague now the riverbank
getting more and more populated Yorgi is closing fast

Down below them Petra can see the white streak of Ahab
beneath the water

PETRA
There it is Hold it steady

Petra pulls the pin on a grenade She tosses it out in front
of Ahab WHOOMPH A jet of water goes up but too far
behind She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when
Yorgis boat pulls up alongside Yorgi aims and FIRES and
the bullet GRAZES Petra’s arm

XANDER
Petra

She loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the
engine compartment

Xander grabs Petra and jumps Together they land in Yorgis
boat The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a
bridge support and shatters

They are in the heart of the old city now We see piazzas
full of tourists markets packed with locals children
playing in front of cathedrals And on the river Yorgi and
Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat

PETRA
Xander Its coming up

Xander glances down sees Ahab nearing the surface Yorgi
clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat Petra
tries to help but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm

Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs
him from behind in a chokehold

YORGI

This is going to be exciting
buddy Front row seats to the
apocalypse Come on sing with me

(singing madly)
“I am an Antichrist I am an
anarchist I wan-na be
Anarchy”

Xander elbows Yorgis gut and breaks the chokehold He
flips him and they both topple overboard

They land on Ahab and both grab on They punch and pummel
each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding
torpedo It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St
Charles bridge

On the bridge is a chaos of COPS FIREMEN and CROWDS OF
PEOPLE They are desperately trying to herd people away from
the river

Xander pounds Yorgi’s face and dunks him underwater Yorgi
slips and falls back to the tail section dragging along in
the torpedos wake

Ahab starts making noise and its payload doors swing open
Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing
Silent Night The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION

XANDER
No you don’t

He pries the first rocket off its launcher The thing is
BEEPING menacingly

IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his
hands He looks over at Petra Shes shouting at him but
he doesnt hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT

He looks the other direction to the mass of PEOPLE on the
bridge above him Total strangers

The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former
nihilist
Through the crowd Xander sees Gibbons break through with his

squad of Agents Gibbons and Xander make eye contact

Then Yorgi lunges onto his back trying to pull him into the
water Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab
starts to DIVE

EXT UNDERWATER —- DAY

With Yorgi hanging on his back Xander turns the rocket
upside down and stuffs it BACK IN THE LAUNCHER

Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river the two men
fighting

We see one man get THROWN FREE the other is caught up on
Ahab and continues downstream

Then the booster rocket FIRES giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES

Its all in silhouette now as WHAM The rocket EXPLODES
setting off a CHAIN REACTION WHAM WHAM WHAM Ahab and
its unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS
The chemicals BELCH OUT in harmless clouds

EXT THE RIVER - DAY
A FUNNEL OF WATER blasts into the sky The crowd recoils
EXT THE RIVERBANK - DAY

Ivan 2 helps Petra off the motorboat They look down at the
water but theres no sign of Xander

Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE
scanning the water Nothing

Tears well in Petra’s eyes Even Gibbons looks dejected
Then Petra let’s out a gasp and they look downstream

Theres a boat ramp leading into the water At first they
see a ripple then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges

The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water
walking up the boat ramp

His shirt is tattered his tattooed body battered But
there’s a look on his face a calm a self-confidence we
havent seen before The Phoenix has risen

ME Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him
- e e e
Xander shakes Ivan 2s hand and then turns to Gibbons
GIBBONS

Thought you bought the farm down
there X Glad as hell to see you

XANDER
Im pretty happy to see me too So

GIBBONS
Youve kept up your end of the
bargain Ill do the same But you

XANDER
But I hate cops remember Except

GIBBONS

Cut the crap X I saw you down
there Youre a hero Dont be
afraid to join the good guys

XANDER
Who says youre the good guys

He starts walking off with Petra

GIBBONS
You know what they say the only
way to change the system is from
the inside

XANDER
Oh yeah Why dont we start by
taking this thing off my ankle
The poison needles

GIBBONS
On come on X Did you really
think we were that barbaric

XANDER
No needles huh What about the
acid bath

GIBBONS
All for show Just a psychological
mind game to get you to do the
right thing

XANDER

(smiles)
Youre a jerk-off you know that

Gibbons waves
GIBBONS
Well be talking soon youll see
Youll be back

Xander and Petra move off through the crowd arm in arm

PETRA
I cant believe my mission is
finally over I dont even know

what to do with myself

XANDER
You cant welch on me now We had
a deal

DISSOLVE TO

ANGLE ON - a big X spelled out in SEASHELLS on the sand
The camera shoots up into the sky showing a perfect white
beach a perfect lagoon a lush green island BORA BORA

Then we hear the BUZZING of a TATTOO NEEDLE
CUT TO
A THIRD X BEING TATTOOED ON THE BACK OF XANDER’S HEAD
INT HUT - DAY
His ink done Xander walks out onto the back deck
EXT BORA BORA —- DAY

Craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water
Xander steps out of a hut built over th water

We see Petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini Shes got
a bucket of HINANO BEER chilling down Its a vision of
heaven

He lays down next to her starts pulling her bikini bottom
OS

PETRA
(laughing)
What are you doing

XANDER
Its about your next mission You
need to be debriefed

FROM UNDERWATER - we see the two of them dive into the lagoon
nude Theres too many bubbles to see any real skin but we
know what theyre up to

Back on the surface we see BUBBLES rising and catch glimpses
of their outlines beneath the water

The Camera pulls back to the deck where we see Xander’s
COMMUNICATOR on the table next to the beers We hear them
surface and start SPLASHING off camera

Then the damn communicator starts to BEEP

FADE OUT

THE END
