FADE IN
BLACK Its everywhere It swallows the screen And so we

into a sea of BLACK

NARRATOR (V0)

I saw a severed head once Except for the
paleness it looked healthy well-fed

The end came abruptly you could tell
cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence

Shh the curled lips attempted Like
it started saying shucks or Shirley
or shit happens Your eyes dont

forget things like that Like you dont
forget the sound animals make when
theyre humping Primal

Raw They endure

in you forever because the senses have a
brain all their own and they recall long
after youve succumbed to the la-la of
forgetfulness

(a pregnant beat)

Sometimes when its dark out-so dark
its black Ill see HIM

(BEAT)

And it starts all over again

From this blackness a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night
EXT SKY - NIGHT

o f a howling WIND across the black skyIt brings RAIN and

THUNDER an d the swirl

Its a man

Its a man plus

Its a SUPERHERO

garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE

ehind him thrashing against the wind and rain
This Superhero Unshaven

Disheveled Worn A face

chiselled with mileage

In the eyes we can see his soul Intense Fierce An

nerve snagged in a fish hook
He hangs in the air tired rain-soaked pissed-off
He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the

visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood
And from the bowels of his very soul this Superhero belches

thunderous ROAR He pivots in the air and dives toward land
He slices through the downpour arms extended body erect
engulfed in the dimensions of his cape

The ground approaches fast He accelerates as if to embrace

Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT
An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface

penetrating

launches

Not

sits

as

the asphalt - head first Debris and concrete spew from the
ruptured orifice as he disappears inside

There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it

nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
down the street like loose change

The rain continues its onslaught

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rain sloshes against a kitchen window Where the sink is

far from the kitchen table Where the LONGFELLOW Family

dinner before them
HORUS leans over his plate eating his meal Here idles

man of diminutive frame bespectacled placid - as harmless

plate finding no humor in eggplant

schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
being tardy Whats the matter with

school and learn about Betsy Ross and
mollusks and not get stabbed on the

INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp STEAM hisses from
side and plumes into a wall of white mist

And from this cloud of angry vapors a figure appears He
surfaces from the dark subway tunnel a cool nonchalance in
gait

It is the Superhero his identity safely concealed under the

collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT He traverses the loading

PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him
He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway

strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE up against the

raped subway wall
On the wall a line of profanity declares that

YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS
He surveys the machine His right arm appears from the coat
pocket Fingers merge into a tight fist And casually he

into the metal vendor like it was Jello
His fist withdraws a handful of bills coins He pockets the

loot He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY

Deposits it under his coat

see STEAM rising from a faucet of running HOT water

It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
another set of pots Shes clearing the table

Down a dark hallway a streak of light escapes from an open
door Inside and on the bed the frail posture of Horus

out of his clothes

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs He stands

the closet mirror scrutinizing the emaciated sand-kicked-

the-face body

Horns strikes

a He-man pose his
biceps in the

He removes the Police apparel

INT RED

EYE MOTEL - NIGHT
FISH

SUPERHERO

His blood-shot eyes mean it
Fish turns to the back wall Grabs a random KEY from a nail

FISH

Top floor 7F Fifteen a pop up front

And your John Hancock makes it sweet

The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet Scribbles

Fish hands over the key Then pulls it back from Hancocks

Hancock eyes Fish mentally dissecting the vermin with his

bare

hands He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot Pushes it

under the window

And while Fish collects he leans into the window and emits
a

deep GROWL Fish recoils The bills fly

Hancock takes the key Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the

strangulated remains of the bell It rolls out of his palm
and

CLINKS off the counter
Hancock sidles off Fish - the cats got his tongue

He dips into a dresser pulls out a thick black leather belt

complete with holster
Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - Its

by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal
He confronts the mirror twirls this piece holsters it And

SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT
A shoulder patch reads

U-RENT SECURITY CO
Their motto TO OBSERVE AND RECORD
Horus tucks a hat under his arms ready to move

INT AARONS ROOM - NIGHT
A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge Outside the

is rain

On a bed sprawled on his back Aaron gazes up at the empty
ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face
Aaron brings his hand before his eyes Looks at it Studies

Slowly his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boys
interpretation of a mans weapon
A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles Horus peers in

HORUS
Hows the eye

AARON

Horus enters

Stands awkwardly before his son

HORUS

Itll be gone in a week Mom11 touch it
up with some make-up and you wont even
know its there
AARON

Yeah I will And I dont want any girly

make-up on my face

Horus deposits himself on the bed Hunches over-h13 knees

HORUS

(almost apologetically)

Therell always be people around

wholl exert force over those of us

who just want to live in peace

Aaron listens observing his fathers efforts

HORUS (CONT D)
(pain in every word)

The thing to do is to avoid them
Theyre no-wins Cant-wins You hold the
anger and move on You hold the anger

(turns to Aaron)
I tell you because I cant take it
seeing you hurt Youre part of me

(BEAT)

Ive felt what youre feeling now And if
youve got any of me in you youre gonna
feel what I felt-when you go up against
one of em Turn away thats what you
do the other cheek You do that for
me No youre not the coward Not you
No Ill be the coward all right Cause
I dont want to see you hurt I love you
I ask you to do that for me your old
man

And while he utters these words Mary watches from the dark
hallway - moved b y his affection

She oversees a father-son embrace

HORUS (CONTD)
Im late for work Get some sleep
Tomorrow always feels better

AARON
after a good night sleep
The light FLICKS off and the mans silhouette form exits the
room

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Horus backs his way out Shuts the door Marys hand greets

him

from behind

It startles the man Hetries to regroup

HORUS

Mary

Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore She
nestles

up against her husband

Horus stands uncoordinated pressing his hands against her
back

He is gentle but as effective as an armless masturbator

Mary caresses his neck Moves her lips to his ear
enraptured

BY

the moment

And out of nowhere

HORUS (CONTD)

(AWKWARD )

Her thin cotton

dress clings to a body stillrobust with enrgy

pop a boner inoud e

And while the storm rages outside Mary burns in a feverish
sweat The swelling steam and running ho t water combine to
saturate her chest and face - she drips

Mary gazes out at the wet abyss possessed by some inner
longing

INT MOTEL ROOM (7F) - NIGHT

A TV SET It MOANS from the corner of a room Scant
blinking red neon from the street cannot disguise thecant

Torn mildewed curtains Damp carpeting et d by every

On a shredded s blotched with urine and cum we SEE a
trenehc -lig’n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the
picture

An open door faces the MOANING TV set Its the bathroom and
its occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock

He squats on the TOILET pants around the ankles cape

around him
Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen a cigarette
dangling from the corner of his lip
watching

a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking

Ooh yeah big fella Thats it Shoot

(male in ecstasy)

Hancock absorbs the action from the can a glint of pain on

face

He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick
deteriorates into ashes before our eyes

And outside it rains like theres no tomorrow

But wait Hancock swoops out of the thin blue swift and

A foreign TERRAIN of trees of lakes so clear and blue

They pass below us as we soar through air and mist

the mist clears thrusting us into the dense foliage of a
JUNGLE We penetrate the silence

the silence it fades into SONG - the silk mellifluous
voice of a woman (not unlike Marys) Her siren call beckons
us takes us deeper into unknown greenery

but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to
song SCREAMS and CRIES rise from the smoke women and
trees

and

red

to

in hysterics

we quicken to a frantic pace slicing through the growth
Rocket and mortar shells EXPLODE in our path splitting

and earth

we remain undaunted but the WAILS of suffering
continues
until we get there there in a clearing as smoke and debris
settle and we see the remains of a lake alake full of
BLOOD of mangled BODIES floating like flotsam WOMEN

CHILDREN DEAD
we SCREAM

INT RED EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

Hancock bolts from his bed - horrified eyes cracked with

The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the

CUT TO
EXT STREET - DAY

Mary stands alone on the sidewalk looking up at heaven Her
eyes search the gray sky for signs of life-
There overhead - a DOT It grows in size getting closer

arriving fast and gradually it shapes into Hancock

He swoops into view straight downward Pulls on the air

and eases into a soft landing - by Marys side
He is wet from his flight and his hands we notice are

together tightly

MARY
(like a little girl)
Lets see

HANCOCK
You have to be quick

MARY
Come on I want to see

HANCOCK

If you blink youll miss it

Hancock uncups his hands releasing a billowy MASS of white
something - it hangs in the air and then dissipates into
moisture It showers into his open hands

Mary reaches for it Too late

MARY
I saw it right A little cloud
She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness

remains

And with her fingers Mary reaches inside to feel the rain

Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face as her
hand

touches his

He stares down at her hand at the wedding ring Mary-
pulls

her hand away

MARY (CONY D)
The water is dirty

HANCOCK
MARY

HANCOCK
Im sorry

(into his eyes)
Its not your fault

HANCOCK
Ive been tired lately

MARY
You should slow down Rest

HANCOCK
-So people tell me

MARY
(heat upon some thought)
It must be hard
HANCOCK
Hard

MARY
To always do right do good when all
you want to do is rest

HANCOCK
Its harder to not do anything What am
I Its not for me Its for it is

about people Rest When there is
despair I cannot I bring relief I am
relief You know that instant that split
instant of time when you realize that the
nightmare the totality of fear
itself that its all been a bad dream
That its safe That is relief The
infant in my arms to the hysterical
mother When you can see her face whats
rest It is self-indulgence

Mary - in some advance stage of wow
MARY

Where who are you

HANCOCK

Its not important who I am Mary Or
what where Im from It doesnt

matter Im aman I am every man

MARY

(sizing up his words)

You probably get a lot of practice
explaining yourself on account of who
you are and what you do

HANCOCK
Why do you say that

MARY
Its like everything you say sounds
so perfect Like you rehearse them so
theyll be that way I mean not to say
that its insincere

(BEAT)
I mean maybe its something about you
but it must be hard on you sometimes

Hancock stares at his feet perhaps reluctant to answer
MARY (CONT D)

(APOLOGETIC)
But probably not probably

HANCOCK

Mary allows the moment to sink in

were more right for you
