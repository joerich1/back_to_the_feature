JASON X
By Todd Famer

WE OPEN ON

An EYE

We have seen this eye before but we cant be sure just
where It stares at us implacably Malevolently It
blinks Blinks again Then closes We are in

DARKNESS

The darkness is slowly broken by moving vertical lines At

first we dont realize what were seeing But soon the lines
resolve themselves into PILLARS

We are moving past pillars A vast line of them -- cold
concrete -- marching away into the distance

INTERCUT

Extreme close-ups reveal bits and pieces of maybe a
figure We see the hint of a shoe a link of a chain a
scrap of tattered leather A MASK An EYE The eye closes

and again we are in --
BLACKNESS

Now we hear FOOTSTEPS We go from black to gray as we move
past the large concrete pillars In the distance looms --

A PEDESTAL
Rising high off the seeping concrete floor it is framed by
pillars on either side -- and lit from above by a single

shaft of harsh white light

Something stands on the pedestal Something huge But from
this distance we cant see what it is

Moving with the footsteps we approach --

Now we are CLOSE enough to see a massive figure wrapped ina
STRAIGHT JACKET and secured by CHAINS to the floor below and
the ceiling above He is immobile imprisoned -- chained

like an animal

As we get closer we recognize this figure His massive
limbshis MASK

A HOCKEY MASK

And behind the mask the eyes The left eye is gone Long
ago gouged out and scarred over But the right eye stares
with dark brooding fury
JASON VORHEES
He lives

An IV is plugged into his neck a steady drip of tranquilizer
coming from a HANGING CLEAR BAG

A young woman enters with a plate of brownies Lets call
her TRACEY She stops and stares at Jason for a moment until
a voice causes her to jump slightly

JOHNSON (0OS)
Creepy huh

Tracey turns to see JOHNSON a young soldier posted behind
the 50 Cal

TRACEY
What
JOHNSON
I said its creepy -- the way he keeps

staring out like that

TRACEY
Creepy

JOHNSON
You know youre not supposed to be in
here

TRACEY
I know I just thought youd like some
company

JOHNSON
Love some But Rowan would shit
kittens

TRACEY

Ive got brownies

JOHNSON
Double-fudge

TRACEY
With nutsjust the way you like â€˜em

Tracey offers up the plate and Johnson grabs a couple
wolfing them down Tracey sets the plate down turns to
Johnson and reaching into her (blouse) pulls out a camera

JOHNSON
(mouth full)
Oh no no way
TRACEY
Come on you promised

JOHNSON
Are you kidding If Rowan finds out
well both get pink slips

TRACEY
Just a couple of quick shots
(unbuttons blouse)
something kinky

Johnson grins mouth full of brownies heart full of light
CUT TO
FLASH
Johnson is snapping photos of Tracey posing with Jason She
mock kisses him grabs Jasons crotchkid stuff It pulls
slightly from Jasons neck nearly comes out Neither takes
notice Then --
ROWAN ENTERS
ROWAN
Just what in the hell do you think

youre doing

Johnson and Tracey compose themselves quickly

JOHNSON
Sorry doc We were just goofing
around

ROWAN

Goofing around Thats exactly what got
167 people killed

Tracey grabs her plate of brownies and dashes out
ROWAN (CONTD)

(continuing to Johnson)
Im going to put you on report for this

Johnson

JOHNSON
Im on report Look we werent hurting
anything

Youve been pumping him full of drugs
for two years The guys harmless
What can he do

ROWAN
You better hope you dont find out Now
get back behind that weapon and keep
your eyes on him at all times

JOHNSON
Yes sir Er maam

Johnson gets back behind the 50 as Rowan stares at Jason for
a moment Everything looks in order She exits

Johnson stares at Jason for a few moments then goes and
throws a sheet over his head It doesnt weigh much but its
enough to pull the IV from Jasons neck

Johnson doesnt notice

JOHNSON (CONTD)
(continuing)
Stare at that you ugly son-of-a bitch

EXT CRYSTAL LAKE - DAWN

We see a nondescript sign that reads CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH
FACILITY In the distance is a small concrete building
Something about its structure suggests that it leads
underground

A military personnel truck stops at the concrete building
Soldiers jump out of the back and disappear into the
building

INT UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - MORNING

Dr Wimmer moves with the soldiers towards Jasons room when
Rowan comes up

ROWAN
What are you doing here

DR WIMMER
What do you think -- Im taking the
specimen

ROWAN

But you cant I havent prepared the
cryostasis chamber yet

DR WIMMER
I dont want him frozen Doctor I want
him alive

ROWAN
Weve already discusses this

DR WIMMER
Yes well I went over your head I
have the Armys permission to remove the
specimen to our Scranton Facility
ROWAN
But Dr Wimmer you cant risk
transporting him through open country

DR WIMMER
You have to see the bigger picture here

ROWAN
Ive seen it or should I remind you of
the last time you tried to move him

DR WIMMER
Weve come a long way since then

ROWAN
Im telling you

DR WIMMER
Look this isnt open for discussion
His unique ability to regenerate lost
and damaged tissue even to defy death
simply calls for more research

ROWAN
Youre willing to risk the deaths of
innocent civilians if he escapes

DR WIMMER
No one is truly innocent besides Im
sure Sgt Mazur and his men can handle
the transfer Right Sgt

SGT MAZUR
Dont worry maam He so much as
twitches Ill blow him right into
Tomorrow-morrow land

DR WIMMER
Dr Wimmer please

DR WIMMER (CONTD)
Youve done good work on this project
Rowan but you are no longer needed
here
(to Mazur)
Sergeant

SGT MAZUR
(to his men)

Lets move him out

ROWAN
But

As they brush past Rowan and shes powerless to stop them

INT HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER
Once again were in the cavernous room line with pillars
Mazur and his men move quickly to surround Jason pedestal

No one speaks Doctor Wimmers upper lip is slick with
sweat The men close in around the STILL-SHROUDED JASON
Some have CATTLE PRODS Others carry noose polls with slip
knots on the end Still others hold BILLY CLUBS at the
ready And all of them carry HOLSTERED SIDEARMS

They stand there waiting for the word from Mazur who goes
to the pillbox and raps on the wall near the snout of the
machine gun

SGT MAZUR
Careful with that 50 soldier Youve
got friendlies out here

Mazur then circles Jason cautiously

DR WIMMER
(agitated)
What are you waiting for

SGT MAZUR
Just takin my time doc I only want
to have to do this once
(to his men)
All right boys Lets knock him out

Three men with CATTLE PRODS move in and administer a
methodical SERIES OF JOLTS through the shroud

The shrouded figure twitches violently then falls still
After a moment the black shroud falls off and slips silently
away Mazur and Wimmer react with horror

SGT MAZUR (CONTD)
What the Christ

DR WIMMER
It cant be

But it is

JOHNSON

One of the chains is cinched around his neck His face is
ghostly blue He couldnt be more dead Grim realization
dawns on Sgt Mazur who spins around wildly frantic eyes
searching Then finding

JASON

emerging from the pillbox His straight jacket is split open

at the seams Broken chains hang off his wrists and drag
behind his legs He stands firm the massive 50 in hand as
if he were about to mow them all down

SGT MAZUR
Oh shit

Suddenly Jason swings the massive gun CRACKING a nearby
soldiers skull

The remaining men OPEN FIRE peppering Jason with ordinance
but this only seems to infuriate him Jason grabs a nearby
soldier and holds him up like a shield just as --

Another soldier FIRES Riddling the captive soldier with
bullets Dropping the dead soldier Jason windmills both
arms WHIPPING THE CHAINS over his head One length of chain
wraps around a soldiers neck The other hits the side of
Sgt Mazurs head

A soldier runs at Jason with a NOOSE POLE and tries to put
the NOOSE around his neck Jason grabs a POLE and smashes
the soldier across the forehead The soldier at the end of
the chain tries to run Jason JERKS the chain snapping the
soldiers neck and pulls him off his feet

Dr Wimmer turns to run but he only gets a step before Jason
throws the NOOSE POLE and spears Dr Wimmer through the
chest He falls to his knees and forward The tip of the
pole hits the floor Holding the Doctor up as he dies

Soon no one is left alive except Sgt Mazur who struggles to
stand shotgun in hand Jason closes in Mazur fires point
blank To no effect

Jason moves toward him Mazur disappears behind a pillar
Jason moves off down the line of pillars heading for an
exit

INT UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Mayhem hasnt reached this hallway yet It remains tranquil
and quiet as Rowan walks along carrying a cardboard box
stenciled on the side DESTROY

Suddenly a SOLDIER runs past

ROWAN
Hey whats the

But the soldier is GONE Then another runs by

ROWAN (CONTD)
Oh shit

Suddenly BOOM A third running soldier accidentally
FLATTENS ROWAN

The box goes flying scattering JASONIANA all over the
hallway blood-encrusted work gloves newspaper clippings
We watch one ARTIFACT go skittering across the floor

JASONS MACHETE

The soldiers disappear through a door Sounds of GUN FIRE
and SCREAMS echo through the hall Rowan struggles to her
feet and moves slowly down the hall towards the door
WHAM

The door flies off its hinges as Sgt Mazur lands nearby
Rowan blood pouring from his mouth kneels beside him

SGT MAZUR
Get out of here Get out now

ROWAN
Whats happened

SGT MAZUR
Hes escaped

ROWAN
Damnit Wimmer

The Sgt dies in her arms She takes his shotgun locks and
loads and moves off down the dark hallway

JASON VORHEES

comes into the corridor filling it with his bulk back-lit
and ominous

Jason picks up his old MACHETE It fits in his hand like an
old friend He moves past the dead Sergeant

INT STAIRS SUBTERRANEAN - LATER

ON ROWAN

Steel steps ring with her footsteps as Rowan pounds down the
stairs She shivers with the cold as she looks for a place
to hide among the huge tanks and gothic-looking ducts and
pipes

Jason moves down the stairs into the subterranean lair

ON ROWAN

She crouches in the dark shotgun cradled in her arms She
spots a large STEEL DOOR and moves to it

INT CRYO LAB - CONTINUOUS

Rowan darts behind a RACK OF GAS CANISTERS Jason enters
his machete ready In one corner the door to a boxy cell
like chamber THE CRYO UNIT Stands open Theres no sign
of the girl

Jason looks around seeking his prey Suddenly Rowan STEPS
OUT OF HIDING shotgun at the ready

KABLAM

The point-blank blast nails Jason in the back and drives him
forward He spins as

KABLAM

Hes hit in the knee He stumbles but doesnt fall

KABLAM

Jason is hit in the shoulder But doesnt fall

This isnt working Thus Rowan glances to a ROLLING RACK OF
GAS CANISTERS beside her USING her foot she shoves the
rack

The wheels squeak as it rolls forward finally stopping at
Jasons feet Jason looks at the rack like You gotta be

kidding me He looks back to

Rowan who just grins and lowers her shotgun She fires at
the canisters

KABOOM

The canisters pressurized contents explode sending Jason
falling into the Cryo Chamber Rowan dives for cover

Hurling herself across the cryo lab Rowan slams shut the
Cryo Unit door And Jason is trapped inside

COMPUTER VOICE (0S)
Cryo Unit sealed Please initiate
activation sequence

Jason BASHES AWAY at the Cryo Unit door

COMPUTER VOICE (0S) (CONTD)
Please initial --

Rowan SLAMS her FIST against the initiate button

COMPUTER VOICE (0S) (CONTD)
Cryo Unit activated

Lights glow Engines HUM to life
THROUGH CRYO UNIT WINDOW

We hear a sibilant HISS as CRYO GAS cascades over Jason His
movements slow as the coldness sets into his flesh

Slowly the hiss dies away as the unit goes silent and still
Rowan breaths a sigh of relief She sags against the door
Then --

THE MACHETE

BURSTS through the steel door and into Rowans gut ALARMS
SOUND

COMPUTER VOICE (0S) (CONTD)
Cryo Unit Breach Lock-down in
progress

ROWAN
No

She places her hands on the Cryo Unit
and shoves herself off the machete
blade She screams in pain and staggers
toward the closing door

She grabs the edges of the door but it swings inexorably
closed She yanks her fingers away at the last second before
theyre pulverized by the closing door Massive pressure
bolts suss the door shut

ROWAN (CONTD)
No

She jerks on the door It wont budge

ROWAN (CONTD)
Somebody No

CHSSHSHSHSHSSH
Gash filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo Unit
Rowan begins to fade She stumbles backward against a wall

and falls to her knees

ROWAN (CONTD)
NO Please

As the CRYO GAS washes over her Rowan passes out
CLOSE ON

Her face as ice crystals form

TABLEAU

Rowan frozen on the floor and Jason motionless behind the
Cryo Unit Door

We move slowly over the scene languidly drinking it in
From Rowanto Jasonback to Rowan
FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN
INT SUBTERRANEAN LAIR - 445 YEARS LATER

PITCH BLACK A light slices through the darkness Then
another Illuminating the stale air

Cloaked figures holding lights move down the concrete steps
and into the dusty space below

They reach the LARGE STEEL DOOR Ice has crusted over the
window in the door

INT CYRO LAB

A thick layer of ice and frost covers the floor and ceiling
Through the door we can see lights on the other side of the
frozen door

Now we hear a HUMMING sound followed by TURNING GEARS Then
the sound of CRACKING ICE as the metallic door opens

LOWE (OS)
Everyone stay putKay-em

The mixture of warm and cold air creates a THICK FOG
Through the fog steps a BEAUTIFUL FEMALE (19-22) We notice
that her movements are fluid perfect and precise Almost
too precise

This is KAY-EM 14 and as time goes on we realize that shes
a science droid

She casually glances around the room sniffs the air then
speaks in a warm contralto that is like her movements
almost too exact

KAY-EM 14
No viruses no bacteria no toxins
Its clean

KICKER a big no-nonsense military man enters and
scans the area PROFESSOR LOWE enters behind him

Both men wear strange dusters with collars wrapped around
their faces Lowe opens his duster and lowers his goggles

LOWE
(awe-stricken)
Amazing Its still cold

Three new figures enter the room As they remove their
goggles we realize theyre just kids
JANESSA pushes past him impatiently Shes a hottie and
she knows it She looks around with disgust

TSUNARON a genius on the cusp of insanity

AZRAEL looks around excitedly

AZRAEL
Awesome this is the real deal isnt
it

LOWE

It certainly is Someone tell me what
you make of that

He motions toward the cryo-cell and can hardly contain his
excitement

AZRAEL
Some kind of storage container

TSUNARON
Probably a cryostasis unit Id guess
an early Port series Kay-Em

KAY-EM 14
Z-port Eleven Manufactured around
twenty-ten Precise historic records
are inconsistent

As they stare at the massive cryo-unit

TSUNARON
Is anyone thinking what Im thinking

They stare at one another with excitement

LOWE
Kicker open it up

Kicker approaches the cryo unit slowly cautiously He scans
it for a moment Then hits the door release button

CHSSHSHSHSHSHS - a cold fog rolls out of the unit as Kicker
slowly swings the door open As the fog dissipates Jasons
frozen body becomes more clear He stands motionless his
machete raised at shoulder height

JANESSA
What the hell is that

LOWE
My god hes a monster Who can tell me
what hes wearing on his face

JANESSA
Some kind of 20th century carbon
filtration unit

TSUNARON
No its a hockey mask

LOWE
Very good Tsun

JANESSA
Whats a hockey mask

KAY-EM 14
Facial armor used in a sport outlawed in
twenty-twenty four

LOWE
Amazing Absolute museum quality We
are looking at the find of the century

here
(shakes his head in disbelief
JANESSA
Kids
LOWE

Azrael are you paying attention
ON AZRAEL
Whos wandering around the room

AZRAEL
Not really

LOWE
Dont touch anything

Oops Hes already picked up a metallic cup He tries to
set it down without being seen But its so cold that it
sticks to his fingers He tries to shake it free No good

LOWE (CONTD)
(re Jason)
Lets get him back to the ship

TSUNARON (0OS)
Uh guys

They turn to Tsunaron

TSUNARON (CONTD)
Theres a body over here

They shine their lights at his feet revealing Rowan frozen
and curled into a ball Azrael moves toward the cryo-unit as
the others gather around Rowan
LOWE
Kay-Em

Kay-Em examines Rowan closely

KAY-EM 14
Shes perfectly preserved Cell
crystallization is at 25 percent

LOWE
25 percent

KAY-EM 14
Suggest extensive nano-tech and phase
one cell reconstruction Chances of
resuscitation are one in five

LOWE
Thats incredible

JANESSA
Whoa whoa whoa youre saying we could
bring her back to life

KAY-EM 14
Precisely but she is deteriorating
Opening the door has compromised her
hibernation

LOWE
(into radio)
Lou get ready for dust off We have a
priority evac

FAT LOU (0OS)
Copy that En route in five

LOWE
Not five NOW

Tsunaron and Janessa prep Rowans stiff body to move as
Kicker and Lowe watch over them

AZRAEL

is still trying to remove the frozen cup from his hand He
rakes it across the cryo-cell then --

A HUGE CHUNK of ICE drops from the roof of the Cryo Unit and
SHATTERS at Azraels feet scattering shards of ice across
the frozen floor

Now its Azraels turn to jump Backward Right into
Jasons FROZEN FRAME

KICKER
Look out
Jason teeters backward then FALLS FORWARD The Machete
still cemented to his hand Catches Azrael in the shoulder

And the momentum takes the kids ARM CLEAN OFF

When Jason hits the cold ground all his chains and shackles
SHATTER into tiny brittle bits

And the impact jars the machete free from his hand

Kay-Em rushes to Azrael whos staring at the pulsing stump
of his arm in breathless horror She removes a syringe anda
clear patch from her pack She quickly injects him with the
needle

KAY-EM 14
50 CCs of etherene Youll be fine

AZRAEL
Fine Im missing my fucking --
(the drug takes hold)
Youre so pretty

Kay-Em deftly applies the clear patch to Azreals shoulder
The patch instantly expands sealing the wound and stopping
the flow of blood
Lowe moves to Jasons body fearing its been damaged
LOWE
(to Azreal)
In the future try not to destroy the
400 year old artifacts

Lowe picks up Jasons machete and slides it into his belt

LOWE (CONTD)
Were gonna make history here people

EXT CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY - WASTELAND - WIDE

Lowe Kicker and the kids appear through the rubble where the
brick building once stood

The trees are gone the lake has dried up Acrid DUST DEVILS
swirl in the dead air LIGHTNING CRACKLES overhead in the
red scorched sky

We follow the group as they struggle to carry the two bodies
across the wasteland toward --

A SHUTTLE

It hovers and touches down on the cracked land
INT SHUTTLE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

FAT LOU rail-thin pilot sits at the comm surrounded
by high-tech displays and controls

FAT LOU

FAT LOU
What did you find

KICKER
You wont believe it Get the Sarge on

INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

Within the bay we see the EX-GRUNT TEAM Trained killers
forced to do manual labor CONDOR SHARPENS a massive drill
bit extending from the MOLE a massive four-wheeled
Archaeological vehicle

SVEN a strong good-looking guy has cornered GEKO female
deadly They should be working on the satellite near them
but instead they are flirting with one another DALLAS and
BRIGGS move a giant winch hook into position

BRIGGS

OS a BUZZER begins to sound SGT BRODSKI crosses toward a
WALL COMM Tall ebony gleaming bald head From the look
in his eyes we can tell hes seen some shit in his time And
dealt some out too

BRODSKI
(into mic)
Brodski here

KICKER (0S)
We found a viable down here

BRODSKI
Say again

The sudden change in Brodskis voice stops the grunts in
their tracks They begin to gather around

KICKER (0S)
We found two bodies in deep cryo-stasis
The Kay-Em unit thinks we can
resuscitate the female Were on
approach now

BRODSKI
Roger that
(disconnects)
Okay team Companys coming Lets
get out the welcome mat

The grunts frown and move away
CONDOR

Brodski flips a switch on his COMM UNIT

BRODSKI

PAN OFF

To Waylander throwing switches and monitoring readouts

WAY LANDER
How much Etherene did you give him Kay
Em

KAY-EM 14

Normal dosage for trauma 50ccs

Waylander shakes his head Some kids just cant handle
drugs

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rowans body already lays on the Nanotech 2000 as Lowe takes

ANGLE ON ROWAN

As Janessa removes Rowans shirt --

WAY LANDER
Damn Talk about your hard nipples

JANESSA
They cant be real Kay-Em check for
silicone

TSUNARON

Shes kidding
Janessa cuts off Rowans underpants

WAYLANDER

Oh boy
Waylanders a hound But Janessa can live with it

JANESSA
And shes clear

Janessa places the thermal blanket over Rowan

LOWE
Okay what next

WAY LANDER
Finish removing the vitrified
extracellular solution

LOWE
That will happen spontaneously

TSUNARON
Introduce metabolic inhibitors into the
cytoplasm
Tsun does know his stuff
LOWE
Very good
JANESSA

I knew that
KAY-EM 14
(to Tsun)
I knew that too

Waylander presses a button on a console An overheard probe
lowers and the table begins to glow bathing Rowan with
radiant heat

LOWE
Stay positive people This will take a
little while
(re Azrael)
How is he

BRODSKI
(monitoring progress)
Just a couple more adjustments

LOWE
Good

Lowe checks one of the many monitors involved in Rowans
scan

ANOTHER ANGLE

BRODSKI
(satisfied)
Son youre damn near good as new

AZRAEL
(re Rowan)
Hey whos the grizzle grabber

TSUNARON
We brought her back from Earth

AZRAEL
Can I have her

TSUNARON
Absolutely

The nano-process is complete

TSUNARON (CONTD)
(re arm)
Try it out Go on

He rubs his arm Not too bad

AZRAEL
All right
(as he gets to his feet)
Whoa still a little dizzy
BRODSKI
(sweetly)
Easy boy Just take it easy

AZRAEL
Yeah right Everybody Im goin to

Thats fine with everybody Including Az The drugs will be
with him for a while yet

Azrael exits and the STEADICAM follows him into the hallway
where STONEY enters Lab Two carrying some equipment The
Camera follows him into --

realizes something and starts moving switches Shes found
the problem

JANESSA
I got it

KAY-EM 14
Lipid cohesion positive

WAY LANDER
Glass Transition Temperature 67 and
falling Were in the safe level

JANESSA
Basal Core Temp was too low causing a
phase separation of lipid

The beeping has stopped Theres a big sigh of relief

TSUNARON
What the helld you do

JANESSA
Her potassium saturation was causing the
hippocampal dendrites to fire early

LOWE
Which caused the lipids to lose their
cohesion Good catch Janessa

even hung him once

Nothing worked Finally it was decided
if we couldnt terminate him at least
we could contain him Cryogenic stasis
Freeze him until we could figure it out

LOWE
Sounds sensible

ROWAN

I thought so But people who were too
smart for their own good felt a creature
that couldnt be killed was too valuable

sharp claws Dallas FIRES The blaster hits home The

wipes his brow Suddenly another ALIEN rises from behind the

STALKING POV
From a distance Crutch is being watched
STALKING POV - MOVING

Crutch drops a skein of thread He bends to pick it up and
glances in the direction of the stalker

CRUTCHS POV

The STALKER moves closer from a different vantage as Crutch
threads a needle with rapt intensity In the reflection we
see that the stalker is JASON

Crutch has finished threading his needle and resumed
stitching We see that hes working on a giant-looking
sampler that reads ENGINEERS DO IT WITH PRECISION

Jason closes in Unseen As hes in striking distance --

The GRUNTS open fire with a barrage of bullets Hitting
Jason and ripping Crutchs workspace to shreds Crutch drops
just in time SPARKS fly as the lighting shorts out The
place darkens

As the smoke clears Jason is gone Crutch peeks up from the
floor

CRUTCH
What the hell is going on

BRODSKI

Crutch scrabbles across the floor making his way out to
safety as Brodski (using hand signals) sends Condor up to the

She braces herself whips around the corner to see --

NOTHING
Just two bloody steel rods sticking through the STOR-POD

Rowan takes a few steps backward panic seeping in Suddenly
she senses danger to her right -- jumps back and levels the
grunt-gun all at the same time Shes this close to firing

to drag himself off the steel rods is anybodys guess

Jason looks down and sees the chain gun placed point-blank at
his chest BRRRRAAATTTT Jason is hurled through the air
with machete in hand He flies through the doorway and into
INT CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
Jason lands hard on his back
BACK TO SHUTTLE BAY
TSUNARON
(total pride)
Thats my girl

Kay-Em stands in the doorway looking down at Jason

KAY-EM 14
Alright lets get started
Kay-Em flips through the air and lands on top of a 6X12
crate Looks down to find JASON IS GONE

KAY-EM 14 (CONTD)
Ooo you wanna play

Jason appears behind the crate and slams his hand into it
It upturns But Kay-Em walks the crate like a river log and
flips BACKWARDS landing behind Jason

KAY-EM 14 (CONTD)
Sorry chump not good enough

Jason turns to her the satellite dish over his shoulder

Kay-Em opens fire Jason and the satellite beyond are
riddled with bullets

Through the shards of flying glass and debris Kay-Em catches
a glimpse of Jasons retreat She moves between two racks
filled with reflective satellite panels spots Jason and
opens FIRE

Panels shatter Shes shooting at his reflection as Jason
steps up behind her Kay-Em realizes her mistake as Jason
raises his machete

KAY-EM 14 (CONTD)
Tricky little sumbitch

She leaps into a roundhouse kick but Jason catches her leg
and flings her through the air She tumbles then lands like
a cat in the Weapons hold doorway then BACKFLIPS into the
weapons hold

Jason moves toward the weapons hold

INT WEAPONS HOLD - CONTINUOUS

Jason enters but finds no Kay-Em He glances around then
moves toward the walkway

OVER HIS SHOULDER

Kay-Em drops to the pedestal in the center of the room She
tosses her gatlin gun aside and pulls her sidearms

Jason turns

KAY-EM 14
Peek-a-boo

Kay-Em opens fire Jason is blown into --
INT WALKWAY B - CONTINUOUS

Through a blurred combo of martial arts kicks mixed with
sidearm onslaught Kay-Em pushes Jason to the end of the
walkway where he finally crumbles to the floor
Kay-Em immediately FLIPS through the air and lands straddling
Jason She slams the barrels of her sidearms up to his

temples

KAY-EM 14
Say goodnight ass --

KAFWAM Jason bashes her in the chest sending her flying
backwards She crashes onto the floor begins to rise but
Jasons FOOT SLAMS her throat to the ground

She struggles to get up but Jasons too much He raises her
machete

ANOTHER ANGLE

As the kids stare into the hallway theres nothing they can
do

JASON
Brings his machete down when suddenly --
BRODSKI rises behind Jason and STABS him in the leg

ROWAN
Brodski

Jason reaches down and breaks the knife blade Kay-Em
glances up at Brodski

KAY-EM 14
I had it under control but thanks

She leaps to her feet

BRODSKI
My pleasure

The exertion and loss of blood leaves Brodski weak He
stumbles nearly falls but Rowan and Waylander catch him

Kay-Em points her guns at Jason

KAY-EM 14
As for you

She fires a round of bullets at him describing a circle on
the wall behind him

INT LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

The slugs BURST through the back wall SHATTERING the
assorted glassed specimens
INT WALKWAY B - CONTINUOUS

Jason must be wondering why Kay-Em fired AROUND and not AT
him but he doesnt contemplate the moment instead he raises
his weapon

Kay-Em opens fire again BLOWING Jasons arm off Jason
stares down at the severed limb as Kay-Em barrels toward him
She spins and throws a round-house kick SLAMMING him RIGHT
THROUGH the shattered wall

INT LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

Jason tumbles through SHATTERING the remaining specimens
which fall all around him and cover him with goo He lands
in front of the N2

Kay-Em leaps through the hole firing then holsters her gun
She reaches back and retrieves the rocket launcher If Jason
could speak his first words would probably be Oh shit

KAY-EM 14
Now Im gonna fuck you up

And then Kay-Em unleashes a final SAVAGE ONSLAUGHT of
firepower A rocket blows his leg to hell Another slams
into the side of his chest

And finally Kay-Em zeros in on his head and fires

POV THROUGH JASONS MASK

The rocket screams right toward him then --

KAFOOM

A third of his mask and skull is blown to hell The
remaining mass drops to the ground And now -- finally --
Kay-Em approaches with Jasons machete She spikes it

ceremonially in the last little lump of Jason that remains

JANESSA
You did it

WAY LANDER
All right

Tsunaron goes to Kay-Em who throws her arm around him in a
very possessive and sexually knowing way

KAY-EM 14
Whos your mama

She gives him a lusty kiss Rowan turns to Brodski

ROWAN
I was coming back for you
Brodski nods He believes her

WAY LANDER
Lets get you patched up

Rowan helps Brodski into the N2 and Tsun throws a switch
EXT GRENDEL - LATER

The pathetic sounds of Grendels distress beacon fill the
time

INT LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

Brodski Tsun and Rowan are alone in Lab One Brodski gets
off the N2 machine He seems pretty healthy and strong
Suddenly the ship RUMBLES They grab hold of something

secure then --

ROWAN
What the hells that

TSUNARON
Nothing good

EXT GRENDEL BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

A piece of the hull flies off the ship and floats off into
deep space

INT LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

TSUNARON
Can you walk

BRODSKI
Better n ever kid

All right maybe not better than ever but not too bad
Rowan smiles and Tsun kicks a roll cart out of the way as

they exit The roll cart thumps into the N2 sparks fly

The N2 continues to twitch and spasm sending random scanning
beams around the lab

ON N2 SCREEN

We see the simple word SCANNING

A SCANNING BEAM hits whats left of Jasons body and stops
ON N2 SCREEN

INT LAB TWO - CONTINUOUS
Waylander crosses to the console and punches something up on
the monitor a ships schematic Brodski Rowan and Tsun
enter

ON ROWAN

Staring at the schematic with a strangers eyes She notices
the BRIDGE SECTION Connected to the RIGHT HULL by three
walkways

ROWAN
Would it help if we just go over here

TSUNARON
No good When this hull blows itll
take the bridge with it

Waylander crosses to the console and punches something up on
the monitor A ships schematic She points to the WALKWAYS
connecting the BRIDGE and the RIGHT HULL

ROWAN
Unless we disconnect these walkways

WAY LANDER
You cant disconnect them

BRODSKI
Blow them up
ROWAN
Dont know
TSUNARON
Plenty of macrocharge in the weapons

Waylander tapes a BLACK BOX belted to his waist

BRODSKI
Well meet back in Walkway B

The teams split up and head out
INT LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS

We see a schematic of Jasons battered body on the monitor
Beside it is the one Adrienne did when they first brought
Jason on board

The computer is busy comparing the two Doing its job
Hoses lower from the N2 and nano-ants pour out from within
They swarm over whats left of Jasons body The scanning
lasers move to the stump at Jasons shoulder

ON N2 SCREEN

SEARCHING FOR BIO-MATCH

Several strands of Nano-ant groups spread out from the body
and swarm over parts of lab debris The swarm pulls assorted
parts back toward Jasons body

ON N2 SCREEN

BIO-MATCH LOCATED -- INITIATE TISSUE FORMATION

Nano-nats swarm with more intensity as a huge sphere of
robotic arms swings over the body and joins in to the fun

On the schematic we see Jasons internal organs being

repaired By now weve figured outnothing good can come
from this
INT WALKWAY A

Waylander and Janessa work feverishly planting a line of
charges along the steel tube

INT WALKWAY B - CONTINUOUS

Tsunaron and Kay-Em set their charges then hustle back along
the walkway

INT WALKWAY X - CONTINUOUS

Brodski and Rowan plant the last of their charges

BRODSKI
Okay Ive got two more that I want to

BRODSKI
No just tell Waylander Hes got the

She exits
INT WALKWAY C - CONTINUOUS

Waylander and Janessa come rushing up the walkway with Tsun
and Kay-Em just a beat behind

JANESSA
All set

Waylander nods

TSUNARON
Good to go

They turn to cross to the BRIDGE SECTION but at that instant
an OMINOUS RUMBLE throws them all to the deck of the walkway

TSUNARON (CONTD)
Hold together baby

They scramble up the walkway toward a DOOR connecting to the
weapons hold But just as they reach it they hear CHANG

JANESSA
What the hell is that

ANGLE ON
The other end of the walkway The entrance from the right
hull The CHANGS get louder as a silhouette emerges

VARIOUS SHOTS

of a chrome black and leather bio-mechanoid of body parts
JASON VORHEES

steps into view A NEW JASON UBER JASON His vaporized
leg and arm are now forged out of Chrome Metal melded with
flesh His clothes are BLACK no longer tattered - fitting

much tighter to his muscular frame

Kay-Em pulls out her weapons BRRRAATT But it doesnt faze
the NEW uber Jason SPARKS FLY as bullets bounce off his
metal limbs

Uber Jason steps up and swings a NEW improved MACHETE It
SLICES through Kay-Ems armor removing a huge chunk of
metal

Uber Jason grabs her and swings against a walkway stanchion
Kay-Em does a back flip kicking Uber Jason in the chest with
all her android might But he doesnt budge

It does nothing She backs off and unleashes all her

firepower creating a curtain of death in the walkway area

But when shes doneand the smoke clearsUber Jason
emerges UNHARMED

KAY-EM 14
You guys might wanna run

BACK ON KAY-EM as --

Uber Jason wraps his metallic hand around her throat holding
her tight

KAY-EM 14 (CONTD)
That the best you can do
(to the gang)
Go GO

Uber Jason cocks a massive fist He punches Kay-Em in the
face and KAY-EMS HEAD FLIES OFF It rolls to a stop halfway
between Uber Jason and where our gang is gathered by the
door

TSUNARON
Kay-Em

KAY-EM 14
Is that it Come back and fight like a
man

Tsunaron rushes back to retrieve the head
KAY-EM 14 (CONTD)
Tsun No

Tsun hurls himself along the walkway diving for Kay-Ems
head like a loose football Uber Jason raises his machete
about to give Tsun the death blow --

But Rowan hurls herself RIGHT OVER TSUN catching Uber Jason
in the mid-section She doesnt take him down but his

machete blow falls wide

TSUNARON
Rowan what are you doing

Uber Jason grabs Rowan by her hair and lifts her up to eye
level He pulls her close to his mask staring at her Oh
yes he remembers her

SHE SPITS IN HIS FACE

Once again Uber Jason cocks his massive fist but --

WHAM

Waylander lands on Uber Jasons back his beefy arm locked
around Jasons neck Vorhees spins dropping Rowan and

smashing Waylander into the wall

Waylander still clings to Uber Jasons back who drives into
the walkway wall again

Waylander lets out an agonizing howl He falls to the deck

his back broken his legs bent under him at a sickening
angle Its obvious he cant move

Crawls across the floor against the onrushing wind Clinging
desperately to a section of steel grating

JANESSA
SHUT THE DAMN DOOR

A section of the steel grating TEARS FREE and goes whipping
past her

THE STEEL MESH SPLATS ACROSS THE HOLE COVERING IT WITH A
CHEESE-GRATER PATTERN OF STEEL

Behind it we see one of Uber Jasons HANDS clinging to the
edge of the hole

Brodski grabs hold of the door frame and reaches out Shes
too far

toward Janessa but its too late
