SHADOWS OF TIME

FADE IN

PRESENT DAY

EXT LOS ANGELES-KSJ-TV STUDIO-DAY

The KSJ-TV studio is a small condemned rundown building covered with
graffiti The KSJ-TV sign can still be seen On the cracked windows are faded
posters from the mid 60’s of the KSJ dancers and various rock bands which
appeared here The faces on the posters are not recognizable There are also no
trespassing signs on the studio

There is a small alley on one side which leads to an entrance the dancers used
The door is loosely hanging on one hinge

Standing in front of the KSJ studio staring at the posters and lost in memories of
a love long gone is VINCE GABRIEL age 26 tall good looking with black
hair dressed in an expensive suit

Vince walks into the alley and to the dancers entrance door As he goes to open
the door the hinge breaks off and the door falls into the room

Vince who is a master martial artist kicks the Mugger in the chest
The Mugger falls and has a hard time breathing

something and you would
be breathing easier

The Mugger runs away

SISTER DELORES 80ish a pleasant woman with a mild case of Alzheimer’s

Vince enters and goes over to Sister Delores who is oblivious to him standing in
front of her

Vince clears his throat to get Sister Delores’s attention
She does not respond

VINCE
Pardon me

SISTER DELORES

Sister Delores gives an ear to ear smile

INT CATHOLIC NUN CONVENT-LIBRARY-DAY (CONT)

A typical library room cozy with chairs tables couch books and a large
picture of Jesus

SISTER SHERRIE EVANS hereafter know as Sherrie a Catholic Nun of about
65 who despite her age is still a beautiful woman is sitting by the table browsing
through a book titled “DANCE SHOWS OF THE 60’S”
Vince enters and for a short time they just look at each other

SHERRIE
Hello Vince

VINCE
Hello Sherrie Or would
you prefer I address you
as Sister Evans

SHERRIE
Sherrie is fine Please
sit down

Vince sits across from Sherrie
How long have you been
back

VINCE

About two years but the
first year and a half was
a lost existence It was
my brother who located
you this time

SHERRIE
What can I do for you
Vince

VINCE
A little of your time

SHERRIE
As little as you had
before

Vince shows sadness and remorse
I’m sorry I should not
have said that

VINCE
No you have every right
SHERRIE
Why have you come here
Vince
VINCE

I need to tell you why I
did what I have done

SHERRIE
You couldn’t tell me that

VINCE
No Sherrie I just had to
leave There was no other
way There still isn’t

Sister Sherrie gets up and walks around Vince remains seated

SHERRIE
have been a nun for
over forty years Vince
After what happened I
knew it was the only path
could walk And still
every day I look behind
me for the answer to the
question of why I walk
the path I must and not
the path I needed

Sister Sherrie returns to her seat

VINCE

m so truly sorry I
don’t blame you if you
hate me

SHERRIE
Hate you No Vince never
that emotion

VINCE

SHERRIE
No where near as long as

all the time in the
world but still not
enough time to help me
understand why

VINCE
That’s why I’m here
Sherrie I want to tell
you the whole story Even
the parts you lived
SHERRIE
I live them every day
Vince

VINCE
As do I

SHERRIE
You have my time Vince
you always did

Vince picks up the book Sister Sherrie was browsing He looks at it then looks
at Sherrie and smiles He places the book down

VINCE

It began a little over
two years ago That was
the first time I saw the
film clip on the
internet I was watching
music shows from the
sixties Hullabaloo
Shindig Rockin A Go Go

(beat)
You remember Rockin A Go

BEGIN TITLES AND CREDITS
FLASHBACK-TWO YEARS AGO

EXT PENNSYLVANIA-THE GABRIEL MANSION-NIGHT
The grounds of an elegant mansion
VINCE (VO)
I had been watching that

clip over and over again
for almost two weeks

INT GABRIEL MANSION-LARGE DEN-NIGHT (CONT)
I surfed every search
engine trying to find
information but all I had
was a place a time and
a name

There are seven framed pictures hanging on the wall in this room Four of them
show Vince’s brother Scott with a beautiful woman Holly his ex-wife and were
taken about ten years ago

One shows us Vince and Scott’s parents both about S0ish There is a black scarf
draped over this picture Beneath this picture is a plaque which reads In Loving
Memory Of Alfredo and Erika Gabriel Dad And Mom

There is a picture of Vince in his karate outfit Vince is a black belt

There is a framed recent newspaper with Vince And Scott receiving an award
The title caption above their picture reads “Multi millionaire brothers Vince and
Scott Gabriel receive humanitarian award for charitable work”

Various karate trophies awarded to Vince and trophies for scientific achievement
awarded to Scott are in a display case

On a computer screen we see a black and white clip from the Rockin A GO GO
television show from the year 1965 A 60’s style rock band is playing with go go
dancers in the background One of these go go dancers is Sherrie Evans at age
25 beautiful beyond compare with long black hair

There are two other dancers behind Sherrie who we will meet later One is
Barbara red hair the other being Kelly a blonde

Sherrie and the other dancers are wearing long black slacks gray midriff
pullover and white go go boots They are also wearing a cowboy hat and holster
with two toy guns in it The toy guns are used in the dance routine

Vince drinking bottled water is sitting in front of the computer staring into the
screen Every once in a while he pauses the clip when a close up of Sherrie is
shown
When I told my brother
what I wanted to do he
thought I was crazy But
being my brother and
understanding love he
reluctantly agreed to
help me

END TITLES AND CREDITS
SCOTT 32 years old tall intelligent looking enters the room

SCOTT

How long are you going to
keep staring at that old
music clip little
brother

Vince keeps his sight on the computer screen

VINCE
(lighthearted)
Probably longer than you
stare at your pictures on
the wall Scott

SCOTT
Those are pictures of my
wife Vince

VINCE
Ex-wife Scott she left
you seven years ago

SCOTT
At least she was of my
time You’re infatuated
with a girl who was the
age you are now fifteen
years before you were

born

VINCE
Love Scott not
infatuation

SCOTT

She’s a vision of the
past That show your
watching aired over fifty
years ago

VINCE
November eighth nineteen
sixty five

SCOTT
Whatever the date you

and her getting together
is an impossible dream

Vince turns to face Scott

VINCE
Not if you help me Scott

SCOTT
Oh no I created the
machine just to prove to
myself that it could be
done
VINCE
What were you trying to
do prove Einstein wrong

SCOTT
I already have

VINCE
Come here Scott Please

Scott goes over to Vince

The video clip of Sherrie Barbara and Kelly dancing is paused
Look at her Tell me she
isn’t beautiful

SCOTT
They’re all beautiful
Which one is she

Vince points to Sherrie

VINCE

Her name is Sherrie Evans
and she’s the other part
of me My soul my heart
my life We aren’t two
persons Scotty her and I
are one spirit It’s just
that time played a cruel
trick on us by placing
our births so far apart

SCOTT
And your location too
You’re in Pennsylvania
that show aired in Los
Angeles My machine
allows one to travel
trough time not space
Dual travel is only
possible on the return
trip
VINCE
They had planes in

nineteen sixty five
Scott

SCOTT
What about money You’re
going to go back and pay
for things with money
from the future You do
that and the FBI will
be knocking down your
door wherever that
nineteen sixty five door
is

VINCE
I’m good to go

Vince shows Scott about one hundred dollars which was printed prior to
nineteen sixty five

I got it from a dealer on

eBay

SCOTT
Well that’s about enough
to cover the airfare
What are you going to do
for food housing and
all those other little
luxuries

VINCE
Good to go

Vince takes a small bag from his pocket which is filled with diamonds He
dumps the diamonds on the table

When get to LA I’1l

sell them It’s easier to

carry a small bag of

diamonds than a suitcase

full of money

Vince takes out his wallet
And I have all the
necessary identification
documents in case I need
them

Vince shows Scott a fake drivers license dated 1965 a social security card and a
draft card dated 1958 His birthday is listed as August 7 1940 His real drivers
license from present time is also in his wallet

Now these are

counterfeit but nobody

in nineteen sixty-five is

going to know that

Scott looks at the fake documents and hands them back to Vince who puts them
back in his wallet
SCOTT
Not unless they run the
numbers

VINCE
Only the police would do
that and I don’t plan on
breaking any laws

SCOTT
here’s still to much
hat could go wrong You
ould change the course
f history Theoretically
ou could do something
hat could end all
xistence

Octxk oad

VINCE

Oh man Scott I’m not
going back to change
history I’m going back
to meet a girl

SCOTT
And change her future

VINCE
But it’1ll be present time
when I go back Her
future would not have
been written yet I’m not
changing anything I’m
just bringing our time
together

Scott picks up a few diamonds and throws them as if he were shooting dice

SCOTT
Forget it Vince It isn’t
going to happen

Scott leaves the room
Vince outlines Sherrie’s image with his finger

VINCE
I’m coming back Sherri
Evans I’m coming back to
fix what time denied us

Vince takes the pictures of Scott and his wife off the wall and leaves the room
INT GABRIEL MANSION-SCOTT’S LAB-NIGHT (CONT)
The room is filled with computers

There is a black enclosed cylinder referred to as the time cylinder large enough
for a man to fit into You can neither see into or out of the time cylinder On top
of the time cylinder are two large crystals

A large waste basket is also in the room
Scott is moving from computer to computer typing in commands
Vince carrying the pictures enters

SCOTT

What are you doing with
my pictures Vince

Vince lays the pictures down by Scott

VINCE

Look at them Scott Look
at them and then look at
your machine Then you
tell me that you built
that just to prove to
yourself that time travel
is possible

SCOTT
Put the pictures back
Vince

VINCE

I will But both you and
I know that the reason
you built that machine
was because you were
going to go back in time
to try and save your
marriage Why didn’t you
go back

SCOTT
(angry and hurt)
Because it wouldn’t have
changed anything

VINCE
You could have prevented
Holly from ever meeting
him

Scott picks up a picture and looks at it
SCOTT
But I still would have
know that there was
someone on this earth
whom if Holly had the
chance to meet she would
love more than me I
couldn’t live with that

VINCE

know how much you love
Holly Scott and I feel
your hurt but at least
you had the chance with
her The only way I can
have a chance with
Sherrie is if you help
me Please Scott I need
to be with her the same
way you need to be with
Holly

Scott gathers all the pictures and hands them to Vince
I’1ll hang these back up
Please consider what I
ask

Scott shakes his head “‘no”

VINCE
No

SCOTT
No to hanging the
pictures Vince Throw
them out I bled long
enough for her

VINCE
Are you sure

SCOTT
Yes When you said you
need to be with this
Sherrie the way I need to
be with Holly I realized
I haven’t been with her
for seven years and my
life is just fine All I
was doing was living ina
memory and you can’t
hold a memory

Vince throws the pictures in a waste basket
Well

VINCE
Well what

SCOTT
If you’re going back to
nineteen sixty five you
better change your
clothes Because they
sure as hell didn’t dress
like that back then

VINCE
Thanks bro

SCOTT
I’m just sending you
back the rest is up to
you

Vince goes to leave then stops

VINCE
What should I wear

SCOTT

(joking)
Well let’s see it’s the
middle sixties the
hippie movement has just
begun

(beat)
come with me I have just
the outfit you need

INT GABRIEL MANSION-SCOTT’S BEDROOM-NIGHT
Scott is standing in the room

SCOTT
Now that’s nineteen sixty
five

Vince is wearing plaid bell bottom pants a multi colored shirt with a fur vest
sandals love beads around his neck and a flower in his hair Vince is appalled
because of the way he is dressed

VINCE
I can’t wear this Scott
I look like I should be
on a circus poster

Scott laughs

SCOTT
You sure do I didn’t
think you’d let me go
this far with it I was
only kidding Just wear a
suit

VINCE
A suit

SCOTT
In the clip all the guys
were wearing suits Wear
a suit

INT GABRIEL MANSION-SCOTT’S LAB-NIGHT-A FEW HOURS LATER

Scott is making adjustments on the computers when Vince now dressed in a
smart dark colored suit and carrying a lap top computer enters

Scott keeps working at the computers and doesn’t turn to see Vince

SCOTT
What date Vince

VINCE
Nineteen sixty five
November eighth no wait
better make it November
seventh That’1l give me
a day to get organized

Scott programs the computers and then turns to face Scott

SCOTT
You don’t plan on taking
that laptop with you

VINCE
If I have to tell Sherrie
where I’m from what’s on
the disc is the only
proof I have No one else
will see this

Scott carrying what looks like a calculator watch goes over to Vince

SCOTT
Wear this
Scott hands the watch to Vince
If you want or need to
return here enter the
code one one three into
this watch Then press
the set key and you’1ll

return
VINCE

Got it One one three

set key

Vince puts the watch on
Does it tell time

SCOTT
No And don’t let anyone
see it

VINCE

I’m going to bring her
back here to meet you

SCOTT
You can’t

VINCE
Why not

Scott goes over to the time cylinder and points to the crystals

SCOTT
Because there’s only two
time crystals Two time
crystals two travelers
The machine is configured
to your brain waves and
mine only

VINCE
But I can come back to
see you

SCOTT

Yes but if you do you
can’t travel into the
past again

VINCE
Why not

SCOTT
The crystals emit
syloneon radiation which
is absorbed into the
blood stream Traveling
once into the past and
back to the present is
harmless But traveling a
third time would be
lethal If you meet this
girl and she loves you as
much as you say you love
her and you both want a
life together that life
must be in her timeline
not yours

VINCE
I understand Well I
guess I’m good to go
What do I do

SCOTT
Just enter the time
cylinder I’1l handle
everything else from
here

VINCE
Thanks big brother I’m
gonna miss you

SCOTT
Go on get in there

Vince opens the door on the time cylinder

VINCE
Scott you haven’t
traveled yet have you

SCOTT
No Why

VINCE
Then you can come and
visit us Stay as long as
you like We have all the
time in the world

SCOTT
Some time I might Now
get in there before I
change my mind about
this
Vince enters the time cylinder and closes the door
I’m gonna miss you too
Vince and I hope it
works out for you

Scott puts on a pair of protective glasses goes to the computers and activates
them for time travel

One of the time crystals begins to glow
The lab is flooded with a blinding white light

Vince presses his finger on a pressure point located below Ralph’s ear and up
and under the back of his jaw

Ralph SCREAMS in pain
Vince applies more pressure and Ralph falls

VINCE
That was only one finger
imagine what I can do to
you if I use my entire
body

Ralph does not want another confrontation with Vince

Vince Gabriel

VINCE
Yes

DETECTIVE KERN
I’m Detective Kern

DETECTIVE ROSS
Detective Ross

DETECTIVE KERN

L-A-P-D We’d like to ask
you some questions

VINCE
Sure Concerning what

DETECTIVE KERN
Probably just a mistaken
identity but you fit the
description of a man
who’s been patronizing
restaurants all over L-A
and leaving without
paying the bill

DETECTIVE ROSS

Were you dining at
Besselo’s last night

VINCE
Yes sir and I paid the
bill

SHERRIE
I can confirm that

DETECTIVE KERN
Do you have any I-D
Drivers license draft
card

VINCE
Am I under arrest

DETECTIVE KERN
No Just like to see some
identification

Vince takes out the counterfeit draft card and drivers license Unknown to him is
that his authentic drivers license from his time is stuck to the counterfeit one He
hands these to Detective Kern

Detective Kern gives the cards to Detective Ross who writes down the numbers
etc

Detective Ross sees Vince’s drivers license from Vince’s time and shows this to
Detective Kern

Detective Kern holds up the authentic license They all see it

DETECTIVE KERN
What’s this

VINCE
Just a joke Nothing
illegal

DETECTIVE ROSS

Unless you try to pass
that off as your driver’s
license

DETECTIVE KERN
The date states that you
won’t be born for another
fifteen years
VINCE
Apparently I have been
born sir

DETECTIVE KERN
Apparently

Vince shrugs
Detective Kern gives the cards back to Vince

DETECTIVE KERN
Alright thank you If we
need to speak with you
again we’1ll be in touch

The Detectives leave

SHERRIE
They’re lying Since when
are detectives concerned
about an unpaid pizza
bill And they were in
Besselo’s when we where
there They saw you pay
the bill

VINCE
I know It’s probably
nothing Right now
there’s something very
important I need to tell
you

SHERRIE
What is it

VINCE
When I tell you this
you’re going to think it
absurd and impossible but
I can prove it But for
me to show you the proof
I need you to trust me
enough to come to my
room

The taxi pulls up and stops

SHERRIE
Of course

They get in and the taxi drives away
INT CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL-VINCE’S ROOM-NIGHT

Vince and Sherrie are sitting at the table On this table is a twelve inch ruler On
the floor under the table is the laptop

VINCE
Have you seen the movie
The Time Machine

SHERRIE
Yes a few years ago one
of my favorites Wouldn’t
it be something if time
travel was possible I
would go to the future
what about you

VINCE
The past And time travel
is possible

SHERRIE
n the movies

VINCE
n reality Sherrie My
brother explains it like

this

(referring to the
ruler)
Time exists in a straight
line

Vince points to the beginning of the ruler
Point A being the
beginning and

Vince points to the end of the ruler

point B being the end
The time line is a
straight continuum Day
to day year to year And
as long as time continues
to exist in this form
travel is impossible

Vince picks up the ruler and shows that it will not bend
You can’t make point A
touch point B

Vince takes a pocket watch from his pocket
But if one were able to
bend the time line into a

circle then the
beginning the end and
all time in between would
touch and travel to any
of these points is
possible Some knew this
that’s why a watch is
round What they didn’t
know was how to bend the
time dimension my
brother does

SHERRIE
don’t really
understand
VINCE

Either do I but my
brother does and it was
his machine which brought
me back in time to you

SHERRIE
You’re telling me you
came here from the
future

VINCE
Yes Forty years from
now I came here to be

with you
SHERRIE
Do you know me then
VINCE

No I first saw you when
you danced with the toy
guns on Rockin a go go

caused by a faulty relay
switch in Canada

Sherrie looks at Vince
I know everything I
showed and told you is
hard to believe Sherrie
but it’s true

SHERRIE
Not that hard Vince

Sherrie looks at the laptop
I don’t think anything
like this exists in
nineteen sixty five And
the video of me dancing
at the studio that won’t
be broadcast until next
week

Sherrie looks at Vince
What do you know about my
future

VINCE

Just that I want you to
spend it with me I
wanted to take you to my

time to meet my brother
Scott but I can’t do
that Only he and I can

travel

SHERRIE
Can you return to your
own time

VINCE

I can with this
Vince shows Sherrie the time watch

SHERRIE
The watch which doesn’t
keep time

Sherrie look deeply into Vince’s eyes
The eyes are the
passageway to the soul
And although they see
all they also show all
including truth and lies

VINCE
What do my eyes show you

SHERRIE

Truth

Vince smiles
I believe you Vince and
the time you’re from
doesn’t matter to me all
that matters is you are
here with me now

Vince holds Sherrie’s hands

you What more can I
want they all came true

inspiration

VINCE

Life isn’t as innocent as
it is now If I were to
compare it to the sea
waves tonight they fall
soothing and peaceful in
my time they break hard
and wild You either ride
them or you fall and they
crash upon you

SHERRIE
Will you tell me about
the future

VINCE
If you so wish But
wouldn’t that be like
knowing what the gift is
before you unwrap it

SHERRIE
Yes it would The emotion
of surprise would be
gone And I like

surprise

Am I a surprise

surprise ever And the

SISTER SHERRIE
You left me to save me

VINCE
What other reason could
there have been

SISTER SHERRIE
I thought I might have
said or done something
wrong

VINCE
The only thing you could
have said wrong was to
have never said anything
at all The only thing
you could have done
wrong was to have never
been born

SISTER SHERRIE
Still the poet

Sherrie stands

Vince stands
It was really nice to see
you again Vince and I am
deeply touched by having
know you but I must ask
you to please not come

A box of long stemmed roses all different colors is in Sister Sherrie’s room

There is a card with the flowers Sherrie picks up the card and reads it aloud

SHERRIE
And so I have to
fantasize about what
could have been and wait
for time to bring to me
the dream which I live
in

She looks at the flowers picks them up holds them to her heart and weeps

Behind Sherrie in a large frame are the now wilted original flowers Vince gave

her when they first met in nineteen sixty five

EXT LOS ANGELES-RESIDENTIAL STREET-DAY
Vince is walking when he hears a police SIREN

He turns to see what is going on
A police cruiser is hot on the tail of an expensive sports car

The sports car loses control and heads straight for Vince

Vince jumps out of the way and the sports car stops

The police cruiser pulls in behind the sports car blocking any escape

Two DEA AGENTS with guns drawn exit the cruiser and run over to the sports
car

DEA AGENT 1
Keep your hands where I
can see them and exit the
vehicle now

Kelly now in her 70’s exits the car and the DEA Agents secure her
Kelly and Vince see each other

Lover boy No that’s
impossible

INT GABRIEL MANSION-CELLAR-NIGHT
Scott is sitting behind one of the time computers when Vince enters

SCOTT
How did it go
VINCE
I almost got arrested I
almost got mugged and I
almost got run down by a

car
SCOTT

You’re kidding
VINCE

Nope But with Sherrie it
was nice She’s still
very beautiful and I will
always love her

SCOTT
Vince I’m really sorry

VINCE
Sorry for what

SCOTT
That I couldn’t find this
two years ago

VINCE
What are you talking
about Scott

SCOTT

I now know how and when
Sherrie would have died
had you stayed with her
It wasn’t an accident as
I first stated she would
have died after suffering
a miscarriage in the year
nineteen seventy She has
a rare genetic disorder
Any pregnancy would kill
her

Vince is stunned by this news
Today her condition can
be cured but not back
then

VINCE
Cured how

SCOTT
Precarvent It’s a drug
that can reverse her
genetic disorder Either
that or just plain old

birth control would have
worked

VINCE
Then Sherrie and I can
have a life together
Scott I’m going back

SCOTT

You can’t This would be
your third trip Your
body would not be able to
disperse the syloneon
radiation this time In
ten years you would begin
to die a violent death

VINCE
Ten good years with
Sherrie is worth a
hundred lifetimes without
her Scott you have to
send me back

SCOTT
You’re asking me to help
you to commit suicide

VINCE
I’m asking you to help me
to be with the woman I
love Please Scott I
have no life without her

Scott rises and walks around the lab thinking about Vince’s request
Scott you’re making me

dizzy
Scott stops
SCOTT
Youd be changing
history

for the better

SCOTT
What if she doesn’t want
the change
VINCE
Then I won’t go back

include a two year time
jump I’11l appear in

each other back then

What about the radiation
poisoning I can’t ask
you to die for us

VINCE
I’m dying without you
Sherrie If the roles
were reversed what would
you do

Sherrie goes over to the picture of Jesus and stares at it She then looks at Vince
and back to the picture of Jesus

Vince stands

VINCE
I can’t compete with him
Sherrie

SHERRIE

I’m not comparing I’m
asking forgiveness

Sherrie turns to face Vince
For wanting you to go
back Even though it
means in ten years

Vince

Vince goes over to Sherrie

You won’t remember this

SHERRIE

When the time is right I
promise

SHERRIE

crystals have enough
energy for three trips
that’s it

Scott goes over to the table and takes the large envelope
I’m ready

VINCE
Not yet Scotty they
don’t dress like that in
