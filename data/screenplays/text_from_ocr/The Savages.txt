EXT DESERT SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT - DAY 1

In dreamy SLOW MOTION we TRACK down ominously unpeopled
streets ONE-STORY HOUSES in matching pastels float by
ECCENTRIC CACTI shoot up out of GRAVEL LAWNS TOPIARY
GARDENS enhance the unrealness of this place as do
lollipop trees and circular hedges

Finally a sign of life as A WOMAN IN A MOTORIZED
WHEELCHAIR appears cheerfully navigating her way along
one of the spotless sidewalks

SUPERTITLE SUN CITY ARIZONA

We are floating through America’s premiere master-planned
retirement community -- a geriatric Eden As this living
brochure continues we catch glimpses of

-- THE GOLF COURSE 2
where a FEMALE SENIOR tees off as TWO GOLFERS stand by THWACK

-- THE FIRING RANGE 3
OLD MEN hold rifles and shoot at targets

-- THE POOL 4
A GROUP OF ELDERLY WOMEN in bathing caps rehearse a
SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING ROUTINE a la Esther Williams

-- ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET 5
A handsome ELDERLY COUPLE on A BICYCLE BUILT FOR TWO

As soon as the bicycle has cleared frame the CAMERA
PICKS OUT A HOUSE and begins to MOVE SLOWLY toward the
drawn curtains of the front window This is one of Sun
City’s more humble model-home offerings Eventually we
are transported into --

INT HOUSE - DAY 6

It’s dark in here but bright sunlight peeks in around the
closed drapes making dust particles visible

Still on the move the CAMERA locates --

LENNY SAVAGE 80 sitting at one end of a dining room table
hunched over a bowl of cereal He is shirtless and moves
slowly Lenny has the labored chewing style of a man who
wears dentures but that does not deter him from indulging
in his favorite crunchy cereal Wheat Chex

It might be “fun in the sun” for others in this retirement
community but here where Lenny lives life ain’t so grand

From another room A MAN’S VOICE wafts in

MALE VOICE (0S)
Upsy daisy thatta girl We’re gonna get
you out in the nice warm sunshine Get
you some vitamin D D for Doris right

THE CAMERA following the sound of the voice PANS AWAY
from Lenny and LOOKS DOWN A HALLWAY INTO --

A BEDROOM 7

Through the door we see an obstructed view of DORIS METZGER
80 a frail woman sitting on the side of her hospital-style
bed staring into space She is being attended to by a home-
health-care worker EDUARDO 45 in green surgical scrubs
and a hair-net He WALKS IN AND OUT of VIEW as he prepares
Doris for her day

EDUARDO
Were gonna get you all fixed up nice and
take some pictures for your daughter --

He exits the room HUMMING CHEERFULLY then disappears into
the adjoining doorway of an OFF-SCREEN BATHROOM His
HUMMING STOPS
EDUARDO (OS) (CONTD)

Somebody forgot something in the

bathroom
Then the DISTINCT SOUND OF A TOILET SEAT BANGING against
its porcelain base Eduardo re-emerges from the bathroom
and marches down the hall and into --
THE DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 8
He stops in front of Lenny

EDUARDO (CONTD)
Lenny you forgot to flush

Theres a tremor in Lenny’s voice but it’s aggressive
just the same

LENNY
I’m eating my cereal don’t ya see

EDUARDO
I need to use the restroom

LENNY
So flush it

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Lenny turns his attention back to his bowl

EDUARDO
I’m not a housekeeper remember I’ma
home-health care professional

LENNY
Not mine You’re hers Go bother her
I’m eating

EDUARDO
Take care of your business in the
bathroom Mr Savage

LENNY
You do it

EDUARDO
As you already pointed out you are not
under my jurisdiction I am not paid to
take care of your shit

Eduardo marches over to Lenny SNATCHES THE BOWL OF
CEREAL and takes it into the ADJOINING KITCHEN

LENNY
What the hell are you doing

Eduardo puts the BOWL inside the REFRIGERATOR

EDUARDO
Take care of your business in the
bathroom and then Ill return you your
Wheat Chex

Eduardo FLINGS the REFRIGERATOR DOOR SHUT and exits
THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE REFRIGERATOR where we see --

A MAGNET HOLDING A PHOTO OF DORIS AND LENNY --
on a cruise in happier and healthier times They hold
glasses of champagne frozen in a festive toast

AT THE DINING TABLE --

Lenny is humiliated and bereft with only his spoon to
comfort him He gets up and shuffles out of the room
revealing that he’s not wearing pants just high-waisted
JOCKEY BRIEFS and a pair of BLACK NYLON KNEE SOCKS

IN THE BEDROOM --

Through A BUREAU MIRROR Eduardo opens a jewelry box and
rings on Doris’s fingers

EDUARDO (CONTD)
Are you cleaning up after yourself Mr
Savage

IN THE BATHROOM -- 11

Lenny stands in front of the toilet He stares into the
open bowl and contemplates its contents

EDUARDO (0S)
Don’t play deaf with me now

Lenny glances toward the door with disgust and then looks
back in the bowl

CLOSE ON LENNY’S FACE
frozen in an expression of doom This confrontation with
his own excrement seems to confirm what Leonard Savage
already knows to be true -- that his life is shit and
it’s almost over But then -- What’s this Lenny has an
idea A SNEAKY SMILE creeps over his face

FROM THE HALLWAY LOOKING INTO THE BATHROOM --

Lenny shuffles toward camera and SLAMS the bathroom door
in our face

IN THE BEDROOM -- 12
Eduardo reacts to the sound of the slam

EDUARDO (CONTD)
Lenny

IN THE HALLWAY -- 13
Eduardo approaches the bathroom door
EDUARDO (CONTD)
I didn’t hear any flush Lenny

Eduardo waits for a response then cracks open the door

fecal scrawl he has written the word Prick Frightened by
his own actions Lenny stands there captured and trembling --
staring in disbelief at what he has done and BREATHING HARD

INT NEW YORK APARTMENT - NIGHT 15

CLOSE ON A RINGING TELEPHONE The ANSWERING MACHINE
CLICKS ON The OUTGOING MESSAGE is the voice of --

BETTE DAVIS (ON MACHINE)
Fasten your seatbelts it’s going to be a
bumpy night

Then the voice of WENDY SAVAGE comes on

WENDY (ON MACHINE)

Hello That was Bette Davis as Margo
Channing and this is Wendy Savage as
herself Leave me a message after the --

BEEP As the incoming message is recorded the CAMERA
PANS to reveal a tenement apartment We see FLEA MARKET
FURNISHINGS a HISSING RADIATOR and a LARGE LONELY CAT

SUPERTITLE NEW YORK CITY

The camera comes to rest on A PARTIALLY OPEN WINDOW with
blowing sheer curtains that looks out over the streets of
New York City’s East Valley on a wintery night

WOMAN’S VOICE
Aloha Wendy This is Nancy Lachman
Doris Metzgers daughter Calling from

Honolulu Its been quite a while since

INT OFFICE BUILDING - BULLPEN AREA - NIGHT 16

A large sparsely populated room with many desks and
cubicles Its after hours A CLEANING PERSON vacuums

WENDY SAVAGE 39 sits at a desk with a scribbled upon
FOLDER before her On the tab it reads FELLOWSHIP AND
GRANT APPLICATIONS After a furtive glance around the
room Wendy types

WENDY (VO)
Dear Selection Committee If awarded your
prestigious fellowship for artistic
creation I would use the money to
complete the writing and research of my

new semi-autobiographical play No
wait

(backing up the cursor)
-emy new

(re-typing)
subversive semi-autobiographical play
about my childhood entitled WAKE ME

WHEN IT’S OVER

Wendy glances over the top of her cubicle and SEES the
disembodied HEAD OF MATT her manager fast approaching
With a quick click of her mouse she brings a SPREADSHEET
up on the computer then covers her FOLDER with AN
ACCOUNTING FILE

MATT
Hey Wen
WENDY
(hard working employee act)
Hey Matt
MATT

Hows it going You getting anywhere

WENDY
Just trying to power through

MATT
Do what you can Don’t kill yourself

As soon as Matt is gone A NEIGHBORING FEMALE CO-WORKER
with a pierced lower-lip smirks conspiratorially at
Wendy Wendy acknowledges the look but as she returns
to writing her letter it’s clear that she wants to
believe she has a higher calling than the other temps

WENDY (VO)

Inspired by the work of Jean Genet the
cartoons of Lynda Barry and the family
dramas of Eugene O’Neill WAKE ME WHEN
IT’S OVER tells the story of a brother
and sister who -- after being abandoned
by their abusive father -- are forced to
fend for themselves when their depressive
mother goes out on a date from which
she never returns

Accompanying the voice-over is A QUICK MONTAGE

crosses the deserted street and arrives at --

A MAILBOX --

where she removes SEVERAL MANILA ENVELOPES from her satchel
In a private little ritual she presses them against her
chest and makes a wish before she drops them inside

EXT EAST VALLEY STREET - NIGHT 19

Wendy walks down the street with a BAG OF TAKE-OUT and
arrives at her APARTMENT BUILDING

She is about to unlock the front door when it swings open
and a YOUNG EAST VALLEY COUPLE emerge followed by a
group of their care-free friends Wendy finds herself
stuck holding the door open as they pass painfully aware
that they are all at least ten years younger

As the last friend exits he thanks Wendy as though she
were a doorman

Wendy slightly startled clicks the machine off and still

THE CAMERA stays behind PANNING OFF of Wendy and PUSHING INTO
A CLOSE UP OF THE ANSWERING MACHINE still blinking ominously

AT THE DOOR --
Wendy presses her eye to the peephole

THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE --
LARRY an attractive middle-aged guy stands in the hall

With a quick fluff of her hair Wendy opens the door

WENDY
Hi

LARRY
Hi

A strange pause as they stand in the doorway

LARRY (CONT’D)
Is this a bad time I saw your lights

WENDY
No Im justyou know
LARRY
Oh okay then I don’t want to disturb
WENDY

Wendy looks down to see Marley AN OLD GOLDEN LAB with a

greying muzzle Wendy smiles at Marley and opens the
door to let them in

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
A MOMENT LATER --

THE CAMERA PUSHES IN FAST -- Larry has Wendy up against a
wall and is kissing her hungrily undoing her pants and
pulling at her clothes

WENDY
(coming up for air)
Let’s go to the bed
He continues to devour her

LARRY
I like it here Let’s do it on the floor

He slides to the floor and tries to pull her down with him

WENDY
No come on Larry

LARRY
I need you Feel how hard my cock is

Wendy is disgusted She pulls away from him

WENDY
I don’t want to The floor is gross

Wendy turns and begins to toss pillows off the nearby
FUTON COUCH

LARRY
You used to like it on the floor -- when
you first moved in remember

WENDY
Yeah well not any more

In a well practiced maneuver she yanks at the base of
the couch pulling it forward -- FLUMP -- transforming
it into a bed

WENDY (CONTD)
It’s middle-aged and depressing It
makes me want to cry

Without a trace of romance Wendy begins to remove her
shirt

LARRY
What’s the matter

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Wendy shakes her head dismissing the question Marley
wants to climb up onto the bed but is too arthritic to
manage so Wendy hoists her up by her haunches She plops
down next to Marley and Larry sits down beside her

LARRY (CONTD)
What

WENDY
Ive got things going on

LARRY
What things

WENDY
Just things Larry Things Its

LARRY
(kissing her neck)

attention

WENDY (CONT’D)
I had a Pap Smear Something was
irregular And then I had to have
another Pap Smear They just called with
the results --

LARRY
And --
Wendy wants special attention -- even if it means
fabricating tragedy
WENDY
And it’s not you know for sure yet

but they might have to go in and take
something out to test and see if it’s

Larry presses his head against her chest and rubs her
belly protectively

LARRY

wifes cervix right now

LARRY

A silent moment as they just sit there side-by-side

LARRY

Wendy shakes her head no
CUT TO

OVERHEAD CLOSE-UP of Wendy with Larry on top moving
rhythmically She tries to get lost in the sex but can’t
She opens her eyes and looks at the ceiling After a few
moments she turns her head and finds herself staring into
the sad eyes of Marley She reaches for a paw Wendy and
Marley stay like that gazing into each other’s eyes while
Larry fucks her

above them FLOWERS and SYMPATHY CARDS abound

Across from them -- NANCY LACHMAN 47 sits with her
husband BILL 48 who nurses a Heineken Their
children HOPE and FAITH are nearby watching “SpongeBob
SquarePants” on the TV Eduardo hovers

NANCY
The hospital is just five minutes away And
dont worry It’s nothing serious Hed
been feeling kind of faint and what with the
toileting incident and all the doctor
thought a few tests were in order

EDUARDO
I told him I didn’t think there was
anything wrong with that man’s mind
That it was just Lenny being Lenny But
he insisted on taking a look for himself

JON
(to Nancy)
So when did he go there
NANCY
Um --
EDUARDO

JON
He lives here

BILL

Uh-oh Jon instantly understands what’s happening but
Wendy is baffled

JON
Why would you say charity Bill Doris

a boyfriend not a boarder They were a
couple They were together for over
twenty years

Nancy starts to cry Twelve-year-old Hope drifts over and
protectively attaches herself to her mother’s leg She stares
suspiciously at Wendy and Jon Wendy smiles nervously at the
glaring child

something Doris had drafted up years ago

AGITATED HAND-HELD as Wendy and Jon march down the path
their balloon in tow Jon grips a copy of the document

JON
It’s like a pre-nup without the nup It
says that even though they live together
they have no legal obligation to each
other That everything is separate And
basically that Dad has no right to any of
her property I bet theyve already got
the place listed

There are lots of different illnesses
that cause dementia and I’m not prepared
to make a diagnosis yet but to my mind
your father’s symptoms seem more
characteristic of Parkinson’s Disease

JON

So what do we have to look forward to
DOCTOR

If I’m right then tremors -- when the

limb is at rest A shuffling walk
Freezing up unable to initiate
movement

As the doctor speaks Wendy and Jon look around at the

(hushed voice)
Its a good idea not to make too big of a
thing when you leave for the first time
Just go real casual No big good-byes
You don’t want to get him agitated before
he adjusts and settles into his new home

themselves from the building and crunch across the
parking lot Breath plumes out of their mouths like

Halfway across the lot Wendy stumbles to a halt and
ERUPTS into a fit of tears

JON

research for the book The couch is
actually pretty comfortable

WENDY
Great Where is it

Wendy watches as Jon removes stacks of books that nearly bury
the couch She joins him and starts to move books as well

JON
Those need to go over here actually

Jon takes the books from Wendy and puts them in a
specific place When Jon turns around he discovers that
Wendy is lifting more books from the couch

JON (CONTD)
(taking books from her)
It doesn’t look like it I know but
there’s actually a system to all of this

WENDY
(with raised hands)
Ooooh-kay

Wendy moves out of the way and watches as her brother
obsessively re-organizing the books

to leaf through it

WENDY

directive --

The Administrator pops a pen in her mouth holding it
between her teeth as she leafs through some papers

WENDY
Hey I take that

The administrator looks up

WENDY (CONTD)
(pointing)
On your pen

The administrator looks at her pen It is imprinted with
an ad for Xanax

WENDY (CONTD)
For anxiety Not all the time Just
when I need it

The administrator smiles vaguely and returns to her work
Jon looks at his sister sideways

ADMINISTRATOR
So here’s the Health Care Proxy we talked
about and the Living Will material
Well need these signed both by you and
your father

She holds the papers over the desk Jon and Wendy both
reach for them but the administrator hands them to Jon
Wendy feels slighted

Her return goes way out of bounds Jon shuffles across
the court to retrieve the wayward ball

Wendy do you have any idea how many
Comp-Lit-Critical Theory PhDs there are

university that’s farther away from here than
Poland and then we wouldnt be together
either See what I’m saying

Wendy makes a comically confused face

WENDY
Youre an idiot

JON
Can we just play the game

Wendy enters carrying the unwieldy bag of water She arrives
before Jon who stands against the front door shirtless and
wearing a strange HARNESS CONTRAPTION wrapped underneath his
chin and around his head Cords and pulleys attached to it
lead to a bracket that is hooked over the top of the door
The overall effect is not unlike that of a man preparing to
hang himself

WENDY
What do I do with it

JON
(holding a rod)
Hook it to this

Wendy attaches the water bag to the apparatus and then steps
back to observe the fully assembled contraption The sight
of Jon hanging there makes Wendy laugh This makes Jon
start to laugh but the laughing pains him further

JON
No I’m just saying you don’t have a

Youre freelance Couldnt you just
hook up with a temp agency down here

Wendy is shaky There is a warble in her voice

WENDY
Um -- actually -- Jon I am being funded
right now to work on my plays And
maybe that sounds a little -- self-
involved -- but I also have an obligation
to a prestigious foundation that has put
a lot of faith in me -- and frankly has
given me a hell of a lot more support
than he ever has

and shakes a few PILLS into the palm of her hand

bottle to his lips

It’s ancient Jon I’m not making it up

Jon watches as she tosses the packet back into her purse
and digs around for something else She uncovers an
PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and dispenses two pills into her hand

Its like a drugstore in there

Wendy ignores him and pops the pills into her mouth

“Buffalo”

Lenny takes a moment then confidently announces --

EXT GREENHILL MANOR NURSING HOME - DAY 110

Jon pushes Lenny away from the building Wendy follows
From their tense expressions and sideways glances it’s
clear they have a lot to say to each other but are
somehow managing to hold it The march to Jons car is
painfully silent Then --

CLUNK Jon closes the passenger door on Lenny and
immediately lays into Wendy

JON
What did you say to them

WENDY
(guilty and fast)
I said he was pretty good except
sometimes he goes in and out

JON
In and out Wendy the man has dementia
WENDY
I know but they only had beds for
people that were more independent and
I thought if we could just get him in

there

Jon notices Lenny peering out from the car and urgently
gestures for Wendy to follow him He marches several
yards away from the car Wendy catches up with him

JON
Youre wasting our time on fantasies

WENDY
She said she’d put him on one of the
waiting lists I mean Jesus I’m just
doing it for Dad

JON
Wendy Dad is not the one that has a
problem with the Valley View

WENDY
I just want to improve Dad’s situation

fixation of yours is counter productive
and frankly pretty selfish

WENDY
Selfish

This thing isn’t about Dad it’s about
you You and your guilt That’s what
these places prey upon

WENDY
I just think it’s nicer here

JON
Of course you do You’re the consumer that
they want to target Youre the guilty
demographic The landscaping the
“neighborhoods of care” They’re not for
the residents They’re for the relatives
like you and me who don’t want to admit
what is really going on here

WENDY
Which is

He bellows

JON
People are DYING Wendy Right inside
that beautiful building -- right now
Its a fucking HORROR show And all this
wellness propaganda and landscaping is
just trying to obscure the miserable fact
that people die and death is gaseous and
gruesome and filled with piss and shit
and rot and stink

The FAINT SOUND OF SQUEAKING Jon and Wendy turn to see --

A WOMAN WHEELING HER FRAIL GRANDMOTHER across the lot
She is clearly upset by Jon’s ranting

Wendy and Jon watch the women pass deeply ashamed of

You do it all the time And on top of
it you insult me by telling me I’m the

His toes They haven’t started to curl

JIMMY

Its something I learned from being here
We all talk about it It’s always the
same

WENDY
The toes curl

JIMMY
(nodding)
Like the witch in “The Wizard of Oz” A
couple of days before

WENDY
Why do you think

JIMMY
They say it’s the air leaving the body

A strange silence Then Jimmy blows a smoke ring It
floats in the air They both stare at it

JIMMY (CONTD)
I’m from Nigeria by the way

rejected eight times

WENDY
So -- how many times have you been
rejected

JON

Thats not the point Six

WENDY
The point is that you dont think I have
any talent The point is that you called
them because you just couldnt believe
your little sister was good enough to get
one of them

Sick of the bickering Lenny pulls his wool hat low and
sinks into his seat His HAND drifts up to his ear

ECU LENNY’S EAR --

as his trembling finger reaches behind it and PUSHES THE
SWITCH on the HEARING AID All SOUND DROPS into an AURAL
MUTED HAZE

A small expression of relief comes over Lenny’s face as
he drifts into what looks like a state of content
resignation His eyelids get heavy He looks at Jon and
Wendy They continue to argue but THE WORDS ARE MURKY
They might be saying something like this

JON
Thats not true

eyebrows and looks at her with amusement

GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES OF THE THREE STOOGES
slapping each other around

A YOUNG BOY sits on a counter between two cabinets as
his FATHER yells at him and smacks him

The Boy doesn’t react to the slaps instead he looks over
his father’s shoulder to a small TV playing THE THREE
STOOGES Larry Curly and Joe are going at it The
CHAOTIC SOUNDTRACK is amplified As the father continues
the beating the boy magically BEGINS TO FLOAT UP IN THE
AIR What is this we’re watching A memory A dream
The boy drifts up and hovers above his father After a
moment the father “breaks character” shades his eyes
and speaks to someone offscreen

FATHER
Do I react once he goes up

ANOTHER ANGLE reveals that we are in --
A THEATER

The kitchen is a set in a little downtown space The boy
and the father are actors in a play We are witnessing
some kind of TECHNICAL REHEARSAL

A LIGHTING DESIGNER is programming cues Wendy is there in
the nearly empty house She responds not to the actor on
stage but to the DIRECTOR who is seated beside her

WENDY
No He doesn’t know it’s happening
Its a manifestation of the boy’s
internal state

DIRECTOR
Uh huh
(calling out to the stage)
Paul just keep up the beating like the
boy is still there

ON STAGE --

The father pummels the now empty space where the boy had
once sat The lights on stage go out so now the only
thing visible is the boy suspended in mid-air

Suddenly fed-up with the inane instructor she snaps it off

Wendy jogs along the East River Esplanade The CAMERA
TRACKS alongside her It’s still early in the morning and
the sun is rising over Brooklyn The water glistens In
the cold air we see and hear her breath as she goes

Wendy is not an experienced runner but she’s giving it a
try She runs for a while and then turns around so now
she’s JOGGING BACKWARDS She calls to someone who is 0OS

WENDY
(breathless cheerful)
Come on honey Come on Let’s go

She turns back around so now she’s running forward again

A LOW TRACKING SHOT --

of WENDYS CONVERSE SNEAKERS slapping the cement The
CAMERA SLOWS a little and Wendy’s feet run out of frame
Now just the vertical posts of the iron fence pass by
and then we hear the SOUND OF PANTING GETTING CLOSER as

MARLEY ENTERS THE FRAME Her lame hind legs are affixed
to a WHEELCHAIR CONTRAPTION -- a cart with pneumatic
wheels that ROLL behind her -- but this doesn’t deter her
from her favorite outdoor activity

The CAMERA TRACKS alongside Marley as she defies all
expectations and runs gloriously forward Her front legs
pump vigorously The sun flares behind her
We stay with her for an extended amount of time -- a full
minute -- or until the FLASH FRAME appears and the FILM
ROLLS OUT of the camera

CUT TO BLACK
