TEXT FADES IN ONE AFTER THE OTHER

To this day an average of 4 aeroplanes and 20 seafaring
vessels disappear without explanation every year within an
area known as The Bermuda Triangle

BEAT

There is no known scientific reason for these disappearances

BEAT

On May 10th 2010 a student documentary crew chartered The
Nautica in a bid to solve these mysteries

BEAT
On May 15th it was posted as overdue
BEAT
On May 16th it was declared missing
BEAT

On June 25th it was discovered by the Seventh Coast Guard off
the coast of Puerto Rico

We’ve got all the gear and Cal is
an experienced diver and he did

an area of ocean that stretches

Rico and then back Northwards to
complete The Bermuda Triangle
sometimes referred to as the Devils

believing that Satan’s crown rests
below the surface of the ocean

enough about the ocean and what’s
below in the depths to be sure

ADELAID

It’ll allow me to find due South
longitude and latitude-

And our location

He adjusts the sextant lining up the sun and the horizon

What are you looking for
Ker-ching Cal holds Adelaid’s REVOLVER up

ZOEY
Fuck Cal

RORY
Be careful with that thing

CAL
I’m gonna go check out the coolant
then hopefully we get the hell out
of here
(beat)
You two stay here Don’t move

Rory nods solemnly

ZOEY
Be careful

CAL
I will

Cal heads out of the WHEELHOUSE

EXT WHEELHOUSE WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS

Cal heads down to the deck The CAM LIGHT illuminating his
path as he moves around and down the side of the ship to the
STERN --

-- SPLASH Cal restrains a scream -- SPINS -- REVOLVER
pointed in his outstretched arm

No sign of anybody

CAL (0S)
Zoey Rory

HE PANS over the side of the balwark the CAMS LAMP raking
over the ocean He spots a ripple But nothing else
DEEP BREATH
He continues on rounding to the

STERN

He checks the area no sign of anyone

Zeroes in on the ENGINE ROOM HATCH Shines the light on the
handle and pulls the hatch open --

-- SHINING the light inside spearing through the darkness
CREEAAK

He spins Scans the area with the CAMERA What was that
Steady breaths as he composes himself and switches the LAMP
OFF Goes to NIGHT VISION -- PANS slowly across the stern
It’s deserted

CAL (0S)
C’mon Cal Pull it together

Cal turns back to the HATCH Now armed with NIGHT VISION he
can see clearly into the engine room It appears to be empty

Cal pads cautiously down into

THE ENGINE ROOM

Cal tries not to let his imagination run wild Plenty of
places down here for someone to be hiding

CAL (0S)
Right coolant- coolant Where the
fuck is it

A COOLING PIPE WANES Cal doesn’t move for a moment Just
exhales

He PANS around the labyrinth of pipes that grow out of a 16
CYLINDER ENGINE spreading up and around the room THEN --

-- A SHADOWY FIGURE stares at us from between the pipes in
the corner of the frame It’s a blink and you’ll miss it
moment that Cal doesn’t spot as he continues PANNING LEFT --

-- STOPS -- ZOOMS IN then PANS BACK RIGHT We hold our breath
waiting to see the shadowy figure but it’s gone -- Cal STOPS

-- On the other side of the room he’s spotted a SIGN COOLANT
VALVE

CAL (0S)
Gotchya

Cal navigates his way around the room to the COOLANT VALVE
SUDDENLY he hears a SOUND from behind Turns Nothing
THEN FOOTSTEPS

CAL (0S)
Hello Guys

The FOOTSTEPS grow closer Cal’s eyes go up to the ceiling
as the FOOTSTEPS pass overhead on the deck above

CAL (0S)
(loud whisper)
Rory Don’t be fucking around

He turns back to the hatch Holds for a moment No one
appears

Cal turns away and continues on through the engine room
toward the COOLANT VALVE

As he reaches it he places the CAMERA down and sees to the
valve

From where the CAMERA rests we have a clear view of the wall
to the right of Cal and what looks like a TRIANGLE daubed in
BLOOD --

-- PFHT Cal turns the valve A burst of pressurized steam
accompanies it

CAL (0S)
Cmon baby

BEAT The engine comes to life Working up from a low drone

The lights flicker to full brightness and as we’re still in
NIGHT VISION mode --

-- WHITE OUT --

-- Cal switches the camera off

Rory cheers

RORY
Way to go Cal

Zoey exhales Closes her eyes

ZOEY
Thank God

RORY
It’s gonna be okay- the engine just
cut out- happens on these old
boats
Zoey shakes her head
ZOEY
Please don’t we both know that
something is happening here
She looks him in the eye he can’t hold her gaze
ZOEY
The plane The radio
transmissions It’s not normal

Something on the tip of Rory’s tongue But he shakes it away

Zoey probes

ZOEY
Rory

RORY
I think- that It’s crazy- I
dunno

The door opens It’s Cal

ZOEY
What’s crazy Rory

Cal’s eyes go to Rory

CAL
Dude
RORY
I don’t know what’s going on

There’s an unsettling silence between them Everyone
formulating their own theories

CAL

Goddamn aliens if you ask me
ZOEY

Aliens
CAL

Yeah- power going off- fucking
Adelaid getting abducted- what else
could it be

RORY
Adelaid wasn’t abducted by aliens-

CAL
-Something dragged him off this
boat- you saw it with your own
eyes we all did

RORY
What about the plane- the
parachute

CAL
Why don’t you enlighten us with
your theory

RORY
I think that we’re lost-
CAL
-No shit Sherlock
RORY
Lost in some sort of timeless
vortex
CAL
‘Fuck

Zoey senses the tension growing between the pair

RORY
That’s the only way I can explain
the Avenger Bomber from Flight 19-

Rory grabs Adelaid’s legal pad Flips to the appropriate
page Reads-

RORY

God rest ye merry gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay

(beat)
I read that air traffic controllers
in Miami logged that the last
transmission from a plane that went
down like 40 years ago said the
crew and passengers were singing
Christmas carols

He lets it sink in

RORY
The Sea Breeze- complete with fresh
fruit and juice even though it’s 3
weeks out of date How does that
make sense

CAL
Then what the hell do we

Rory considers this
RORY

Best guess- get out of the
triangle

Cal looks over the controls Fires the ignition The ship

rumbles to full power
CAL
(re the engine)
That’s what I’m talking about

Cal’s hand hovers over the controls-

CAL
Anchor up

Cal hits the anchor lever It starts to reel in

CAL
And away we go

SUDDENLY the anchor stalls WARNING LIGHT FLASHES

CAL
Huh

The anchor is snagged

Cal tries the lever again

CAL
Cmon baby

ZOEY
Wassup

CAL

Goddamn anchors snagged
He looks over the control screen

CAL
Hung up- like 20 meters down

ZOEY
Try lowering it again

Cal does But WARNING MESSAGE

CAL
Youre shitting me

He tries raising it again No use

RORY
What are we gonna do now

Cal looks something ticking over in his brain

CAL
Okay-

He checks the SONAR Still not working correctly

CAL
C’mon

He tries to get a reading of the underwater typography but
it’s no use

ZOEY
Cal

CAL
It’s probably a reef I’ve known it
happen on dives sometimes the
anchors get hung up

RORY
What do we do

And off Cal’s look-

Cal is sat on a bench pulling on FLIPPERS Decked out in a
WET SUIT and SCUBA GEAR

ZOEY
Are you sure about this
CAL
I’ve done my fair share of night

dives
He smiles trying to reassure her

CAL
It’s preferable to us staying here
and having an alien probe shoved up
our asses

RORY
Thought you’d like that

CAL
Only on the weekends

Zoey finds her smile that has deserted her for so long

ZOEY
Sick

Rory looks at Cal serious now
RORY (0S)
Cal it’ll be zero visibility down

there

CAL
That’s why I’m taking the Ikelite

Cal unpacks a NIKO IKELITE UNDERWATER CAMERA Counter
balanced for buoyancy

IKELITE CAMERA FOOTAGE
A POWERFUL FLORESCENT LIGHT guides us as Cal descends

The anchor chain comes into view Cal zeroes in on it
Follows it down into the darkness

It’s a slow descent and we’re with Cal the whole way down
Waiting Tense as hell

Cal checks the DEPTH GAUGE on his wrist 10 METERS
Tension mounts the deeper we get --

-- Something darts in front of the CAMERA It’s fast and gone
in an instant Cal jolts Must have been a Fish

Cal regains composure Checks his depth gauge 16 METERS Not
far now and continues down

--and down

But the Anchor is nowhere in sight

Cal stops Checks the depth gauge on his wrist 23 METERS
Cal hovers This makes no sense

A LONG LONELY MOMENT as Cal scans the gloomy surrounds
Nothing He’s alone Feeling incredibly isolated

Cal makes a decision he swims down deeper Following the
anchor chain into a black abyss

But there appears to be no end in sight

It’s tense We’re watching the edges of the screen waiting
for whatever is down here with Cal

He stops Checks the gauge on his wrist 28 METERS
Can’t be right

Cal swings the Ikelite UP toward the surface Visibility only
a few feet even with the florescent light

He TILTS the CAMERA back down -- SWOOSH -- the ANCHOR FLIES
PAST hits the CAMERA Our world becomes a blur of movement
a rush of air bubbles --

It’s a lighthouse what range do
they have We must be close right

Trying to convince himself more than her

Zoey is still thinking about Cal She nearly breaks down
holds her head in her hands

RORY
Hey

Knows there are no words he can say as she wraps her arms
around him burying her head into his shoulder finding some
comfort

RORY
We’re going to make it

We can make it to that lighthouse
They’1l have a phone We can get
help

SUDDENLY A CRACK OF THUNDER

They both look up as LIGHTNING SHREDS THE SKY and the first
drops of rain begin

They watch as the storm seem to be brewing directly above the
lighthouse growing louder and louder

The rain hits heavier DRUMMING against the wheelhouse

The wind begins to whip up a frenzy

Oh shit

ZOEY
It doesn’t want us to leave does
it

Just hold onto to me

Zoey tightens her grip around his waist as the SWELL ROCKS

RORY
Jesus

The windshield is soon awash with rain and spray Rory can’t
see much straining to see the FLASHING LIGHTHOUSE BEACON

Zoey checks the controls for the WIPERS Hits a button The
wipers spring to action

RORY

Good thinking

The SHIP begins to sway as it rides over the building waves

Rory wrestles with the wheel completely in over his head
Fighting to keep control Muscles straining as-

THUNDER BREAKS OVERHEAD

Shit

A BOLT of lightning rips across the sky

RORY
We can make it-

Zoey holds on for dear life

Once we get to land we’1ll be fine

SPOKES -- SNAP It BREAKS his wrist

HE SCREAMS IN AGONY Falls to the floor

against the fierce ocean --

slide along the floor crashing into the wall --

YELPING

WATER comes into focus We realize that we flailing in the
night sea washing up on the shore --

EXT SHORELINE - NIGHT

-- The image sharpens on the face of Cal Still wearing his
scuba mask and breathing apparatus as the ocean laps against
him and around the lens The Ikelite still attached to his
belt via the cord

Cal’s eyes are closed He’s unconscious

A BEAT and his eyes open wearily He gets his bearings Rolls
onto his back Removes his mask and breathing apparatus

On the beach we see his discarded scuba equipment

Cal brings the CAMERA UP Tries to focus on something but
it’s too dark to make out what

CLICK NIGHT VISION We’re now able to make out what we were
looking at A LIGHTHOUSE CLASSIC COASTAL DESIGN A WHITE
BODY reaching 120 feet into the sky Only its LANTERN isn’t
lit

CAL (0S)
Lighthouse-

Cal PANS around to the ocean It’s calm No sign of the storm
or The Nautica

CAL (0S8)
Right- I’m on shore- I made it

He goes through it in his mind PANS around to the
LIGHTHOUSE

CAL (0S)
They can’t be far- I washed up on
shore- they can’t be far- they
can’t be

Cal begins sprinting up the shore toward the lighthouse

He makes it to the lighthouse circles around to the door
spots a PADLOCK BANGS on it

He steps back looks the lighthouse up and down Places the

Cal is standing before the door POUNDING the padlock with
the OXYGEN TANK The lock SMASHES to the ground

Cal throws the tank to one side Pushes the door open Peers
inside --

-- Cal grabs the CAMERA cautiously ventures inside Stops
dead Feels a chill

Looks around the gloom

HE SWITCHES THE CAM FROM NIGHT VISION TO SHOOTING MODE Hits
on the FLORESCENT LIGHT The bright beam expels the dark

He TILTS DOWN -- a RAT scurries over his feet He flinches

Fuck off

spirals up to the summit of the lighthouse

Cal begins toward the staircase Peers up

LAM He jumps out of his skin -- WHIPS BACK -- the door has

SLAMMED SHUT

Cal swallows hard and begins up the staircase gradually
picking up the pace as it spirals higher and higher

Were with him every step of the way The CAM LIGHT cutting
through the veil of blackness

His breathing starts to grow laboured and heavy as he begins
to slow a little --

-- THUD The SOUND of FALLING ROCKS echoes down the
staircase

Cal stops dead the sound enough to send a shudder down his
spine

He listens hard The silence absorbing

TENSE MOMENT as he holds the CAM up illuminating as far as
he can see before the stairs curve out of view

Cal takes a step then another Slow and precise Hand
beginning to tremble Genuinely unnerved

KRAKAKAKAKAKAKAKAAK The SOUND of something heading Cal’s
way He goes rigid

Hand trembling even more uncontrollably as the SOUND is
almost upon him --

-- A BASEBALL SIZED ROCK rolls into view stopping at Cal’s
foot

He breathes a huge sigh of relief Presses on picking up the
pace and

Finally Cal arrives at the
LANTERN ROOM
He draws a breath eyeing the huge glass encased lantern

Cal rushes to a CONTROL PANEL Wastes no time in HITTING A
BUTTON

The lantern filament fuses to full brightness and begins to
rotate

Cal kills the CAMERA LAMP and places it down Still rolling
It films him as he presses against the glass Staring out
across the ocean A BLACK WILDERNESS THEN he spots
something

CAL
Yes

He reaches around and grabs the CAMERA HOLDS IT to the
glass PUNCHES IN on a faint vestige of light in the
distance The Nautica
CAL (0S)
YES C’mon baby- I know you see
this light- c’mon

THUNDER BOOMS Startling Cal A FORK of lightning lacerates
the sky

Rain begins to pour Getting heavier by the second

We realize that this is the LIGHTHOUSE that Zoey and Rory
headed for

Cal slides down the glass Relieved Exhausted

The CAMERA rests at the side of him Still rolling All we
can see are his outstretched legs and feet

As the lighthouse LANTERN rotates it illuminates the area in
front of the CAMERA and Cal’s feet

The STACCATO-ESQUE strokes of light continue Again and
again UNTIL -- A SHADOW appears at the edge of the frame for
a split second 5 feet from Cal’s feet as the light strokes
past

The light passes again But the shadow is gone
Clearly Cal hasn’t seen it because he doesn’t react

THUNDER ROLLS overhead Frighteningly loud and close A brief
flash of lightning follows

Cal shuffles back to his feet leaves the CAMERA where it is

CAL (0S)
That’s it right over here

The CAMERA continues to film and captures the SHADOW This
time CLOSER

CAL (0S)
Come on-

SHRUUUP Cal is violently yanked from off his feet by an
unseen force -- SLAMS FACE FIRST in front of the CAMERA and
is dragged away DOWN the stairs and out of sight

His SCREAMS ECHO throughout the turret before coming to
nothing

The SHOT HOLDS illuminated by strokes of the lantern

It’s an unsettling few moments Just waiting and waiting Our
eyes narrowing expecting something from each lantern stroke

The same monotonous dark Light Dark Light Dark continues
THEN --

-- A HAND shoots into FRAME from the staircase Gradually Cal
hauls himself back up the stairs and into the lantern room

His face etched in pain Can’t speak almost like he’s
choking

He crawls toward the CAMERA --

lantern goes out

SILHOUETTE is now closer to Zoey and Rory

ZOEY
Please- what do I do

Rory is in too much pain to answer

THE IMAGE STUTTERS AGAIN Once it settles the SILHOUETTE is
standing over Zoey and Rory

Zoey has no idea of its presence

In the distance we catch glimpses of the LIGHTHOUSE LANTERN
flashing But then it ceases Extinguished

Zoey looks up realizing that their beacon of hope is gone
Quickly the LIGHT inside the WHEELHOUSE RETURNS

A BEAT and CAMERA 2 CLICKS back over to shooting mode and
the SILHOUETTE is gone

Zoey gets a good look at Rory’s wrist Her hand goes to her
mouth Almost vomits His hand is bent out of shape Bone
broken and protruding out of the skin

ZOEY
Oh God

Rory can’t look at it just cradles it Whimpering close to
passing out

ZOEY
It’s okay- don’t look

Outside we realize that the storm is settling the rain less
terrific The thunder and lightning gone

ZOEY
Rory we need to strap it up

Rory isn’t hearing the words as shock takes a grip
ZOEY
We need to stop the bleeding do
you understand

He nods going white

Zoey thinks Looks around rises to her feet quickly checks
the wheelhouse looking for a MEDICAL KIT

he falls into her arms

She’s not strong enough to hold him up and lays him down on
the floor as gently as she can

RORY
Don’t leave me

ZOEY
I wont

She opens the MEDICAL BOX Empties the contents

ZOEY
I need to bandage it and stop the
bleeding

RORY
Okay

Zoey rifles through the spilled contents Nothing of much
use save for a bandage and tape

Here goes THEN-—

RORY
Wait- Zoey

She looks into his eyes

RORY
I just wanted to say that

She kisses him Passionately on the lips A charged moment
neither want to stop but eventually their lips part

ZOEY
You were saying
RORY
That was pretty much all I wanted

to say

She smiles

RORY
And that I wish I’d said it
earlier
They kiss again
ZOEY

Me too
She looks down at his wrist He swallows hard

ZOEY
Don’t look

every sound shifting the CAM this way then that

She reaches out for the light switch Flicks it Nothing
She sighs totally drained from everything that has happened
Suddenly the SOUND of something A TUNE Seems familiar

ZOEY (0S)
Wh

We recognize the tune SUPER BASE by Nicky Minaj It’s ZOEY’S
CELL PHONE

But Zoey’s hope is quickly dashed as she realizes that it’s
coming from within her room

She moves toward the door presses her ear against it Her
cell phone still ringing

She knows she needs to take that call

She takes hold of the chair willing herself to move it from
under the handle but she can’t

Her cell STOPS RINGING

ZOEY (0S)
No

She starts to crumble
ZOEY (0S)
(defiant)
What do you want
Fights back the tears

CHINK Zoey flinches a breath catching in her throat That
came from behind her

She doesn’t move for a moment Then slowly PANS around
Trains the CAMERA on a CUP hanging from a peg rocking
slightly

A locked BEAT THEN --

-- She jumps as her CELL PHONE begins to ring again

She listens Makes a decision and shifts the chair from under
the door handle and pulls the door open

The door widens revealing an empty corridor behind it

She makes a beeline into her room

INT ZOEY’S ROOM - CAMERA 5 - CONTINUOUS

Zoey instantly spots her RINGING CELL GRABS IT Checks the
display

ZOEY
(answers )
Mom- Mom it’s me- I’m lost

She realizes that it has rung off No one is there

ZOEY
No

She tries dialing but she hasn’t got any signal

ZOEY
Please work Mom

But it’s no use She breaks down Begins to sob

As she does we notice the closet door OPEN slightly Zoey
doesn’t see it

TENSE BEAT

THEN the closet door swings open as Rory’s broken body drops
out and onto the bed

Zoey SCREAMS -- dashes out of the ROOM

THE CAMERA GOES OFFLINE BLACKNESS

her chest Sobbing

CUT

SUPER UNKNOWN TIME

Zoey is sat in the same spot half hidden in the shadows No
longer crying but exhausted

CUT

SUPER UNKNOWN TIME

Zoey’s eyes are struggling to stay open We have no idea how
much time has passed Hours Days

The shot holds and then CUTS TO BLACK
WE HOLD ON BLACK WAITING FINALLY

CUT TO

INT ZOEY’S ROOM - LATER
SUPER UNKNOWN TIME

The HD CAM is lying where Zoey left it on her bed looking at
Rory’s body

Suddenly it moves Floats up PANS AROUND we catches a
glimpse of it in the mirror NO ONE is holding it

The CAM moves out into the corridor Heads down through the
dark and up onto the
MAIN DECK
It continues around up the wheelhouse stairs and into the
WHEELHOUSE
It searches for ZOEY finding her lying under the radio
counter Now asleep It creeps closer settling next to her
Staring at her face as she sleeps

CUT

Still looking at Zoey We realize that something is
different it’s getting lighter

CUT

Zoey is still asleep but has her back turned to the camera
Now bathed in bright sunshine

A moment later we HEAR the SOUND of the WHEELHOUSE DOOR
OPENING

THEN—

MALE VOICE (0S)
Jesus- we got somebody up here

OS Footsteps head toward Zoey and a HAND reaches into frame
and gently wakes her

MALE VOICE (0S)
Hello miss

Zoey springs awake Coils up Frightened Lips quivering
Breathes short and sharp

A male kneels down into shot A friendly man in his late
20s dressed in a COAST GUARD FATIGUES This is JACK

MALE VOICE JACK
It’s okay I’m Jack Davey Part of
the Seventh Coast Guard I’m here
to help- we heard your mayday

Zoey breaks down as Jack gently places his arms around her
helping her to her feet

ZOEY
(sobbing)
They’re gone

The door opens again ANOTHER VOICE ROB

ROB (0S)
What happened here- is she okay

JACK (0S)
She will be I’m gonna get her off
this boat get her some warm
blankets and food

Zoey is taken away
A moment later

ROB (0S)
(to himself)
What is that Some kind of movie
camera

The HD CAM is lifted up and inspected by Rob he stares into
the lens we notice a distinguishing MOUSTACHE and MOPPISH
HAIR

He takes the CAMERA with him and exits the wheelhouse

EXT MAIN DECK - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

Rob pauses for a moment on the WALKWAY PANS across the
ocean A distant horizon where a tranquil azure sea meets a
cloudless sky

The CAM finds Zoey and Jack as she is carried onto THE
SEVENTH COAST GUARD SHIP which is anchored next to The
Nautica

But something seems odd And then we realize that the ship is
old say 40 years old and the crew all look like they belong
in a different era- beards complimented by bowl cut hair
styles

It hits us this is the Seventh Coast Guard ship that we
heard went missing at the start of the movie

The CAM focuses on JACK’S BACK it’s slick with BLOOD the
back of his skull split oblivious to Zoey as she boards the
waiting COAST GUARD SHIP

We notice that other members of the coast guard have suffered
some sort of trauma One holds his throat BLOOD oozing
between his fingers Another has suffered a head wound
Essentially the walking dead

And finally the CAM settles upon the HULL OF THE COAST GUARD
SHIP IT READS USCG SEVENTH COAST GUARD 8776

THE BATTERY WARNING SYMBOL FLASHES
