PET SEMATARY II

FADE IN

INT LEMARCHE CASTLE TOMB - NIGHT A storm is raging outside We hear the clap and roll of THUNDER
TOMB STAIRWAY -

RATS scurry away down the scum-covered steps as the GLOW OF A
LANTERN and FOOTSTEPS herald someones arrival

GENVIEVE LEMARCHE
emerges around the bend Mid-30s Cultured beauty Her dress and
face are smeared with grime and is that blood we see too God

only knows whats happened to her

Genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open
window

WINDOW

LIGHTNING streaks across the night sky outside We catch a glimpse
of the MOON disappearing behind the clouds

Genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs The tomb itself

Water trickles in through cracks in the lichen-covered walls
pooling on the tomb floor

Genvieve moves forward her lantern throwing distorted shadows
over everything

In front of her is Anton LeMarches stone sarcophagus
Genvieve kneels in the water one hand resting on the spiked iron
railing which surrounds the tomb She reaches the other hand
towards a scum-covered plaque brushing the grime away

THUNDER and LIGHTNING reach a crescendo as
A SKELETAL HAND rises out of the water reaching for her

Genvieve SCREAMS The lantern falls from her grasp sputtering
out The hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her
breast instead

Genvieve starts to laugh hysterically

DIRECTOR (0S)
(exasperated)
Cut Thank you Renee Can we
throw some light on the set

GENVIEVE
Im sorry

Suddenly it is lighter Genvieve cant stop laughing The groping
monster hand disappears back beneath the water

WE PULL BACK REVEALING -

Its not 1865 The LeMarche Castle tomb is in fact a 90s movie

should really read

Wardrobe and make-up personnel move in to adjust Renees
appearance

RENEE

The MAKE-UP GIRL pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny-pack
and offers Renee one In a flash a PA appears with a lighter

trying to see past the set lights

her and moves off the set standing near the camera

The director turns back toward Renee

DIRECTOR
Alright Renee Last time I

creating the proper atmosphere once again

We see an undetected LEAK Water drips down The puppeteer shifts
position struggling and

ReneeGenvieve grabs the iron railing with both hands

Electricity surges through Renee Her body jerks and writhes like
some nightmarish marionette

Crewmembers SCREAM and scramble back

All the circuits are blowing lights EXPLODING and showering
sparks over the whole set This is not part of the movie

RENEE
Its awful She shakes her SMOKING HANDS frozen to the iron
railing by the electricity running through her

Suddenly Renee falls forward against the iron Her face begins to
SMOKE AND SINGE

The lights CONTINUE TO BLOW casting a strobic effect over the
soundstage adding to the chaos

ON GEOFF

As he witnesses the whole event He tries to rush forward but
someone restrains him

GEOFF

EXT A DREAMLIKE FOG
A form drifts forward materializing out of the fog

Its a CASKET Appearing as if its floating among the clouds
PULLING BACK WE SEE that its moving along A CONVEYOR AND NOW
WE CAN make out the faint form of A PLANE as the conveyor descends
from the cargo compartment

The casket reaches the end of the conveyor A tag marks its final
destination Bangor Maine HANDS reach in and lift the casket
FOUR BAGGAGE HANDLERS hoist the casket up onto their shoulders and
carry it off

HANDLER 1
Is it true she grew up around
here

HANDLER 2

Yeah Over in Ludlow

HANDLER 1
Huh Never met a movie star
before
HANDLER 3
Well youre a little late for an
autograph

The baggage handlers laugh as they walk off into the distance The
fog closes around them and we

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - DAY

We drift down from the gray sky to the somber scene below Off in
the distance a crowd of MOURNERS are gathered around a grave

PRIEST (VO)
I am the resurrection and the
life saith the Lord

CLOSER -
THE HEADSTONE is adorned with an iron plaque It reads simply

RENEE HALLOW MATTHEWS
1955-1991

PRIEST (VO)
-She that believeth in me
though she were dead yet shall
she live and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never
die

THE CASKET is slowly lowered into the open grave As it descends
WE SEE Geoff and his father Chase standing at the forefront of
the crowd Renees grave is next to those of her parents

Among the mourners is MARJORIE HARGROVE an attractive local girl
in her early twenties

Further down the hillside a wall of NEWS REPORTERS are gathered
behind a roped-off media boundary There is a blinding flurry of
PHOTO FLASHES as the press records the scene before them

A SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT PATROL CAR cruises up the cemetery drive
pulling to a stop near the mob of reporters

Out of the car steps GUS GILBERT Gus is nearly forty with a
Sheriffs uniform fitted to his solid ageless frame Gruff maybe
a little self-important Gus likes being a big fish in a small
pond

GUS
(drawing near)
Lets keep it back folks
Try to show her a little
respect
A REPORTER ducks under the media boundary moving in for a closer
shot

He doesnt make it two steps before hes intercepted by Gus Gus
grabs the reporter and shoves him back

GUS
Hey What did I just say

Gus means business One look into his eyes reveals his intense no
nonsense approach

REPORTER
Ass-hole

The reporter backs off
BACK AT THE GRAVESIDE -

Beneath the gloomy ominous skies the lines on Chases face shade
him as a decade older than his thirty-five years Chase gently
places a comforting hand on Geoffs shoulder

Geoff inches forward pulling free of Chases touch Drawn to his
mother drawn from his father The only blemishes on his youthful
rosy cheeks are the tears the endless tears
PRIEST (VO)

I know that my redeemer liveth

and that he shall stand at the

latter day upon the earth
Geoff looks upon the casket gazing into the abyss of despair
FOLLOWING THE CEREMONY

The crowd has dispersed

Geoff is standing at the base of Renees grave His eyes fixed
Unmoving Unaccepting

Chase is nearby watching not wanting to intrude on Geoffs
private moment

Gus quietly moves in at Chases side
GUS
Did she always have reporters

following her around like this

CHASE
Pretty much so

Gus glances at Geoff

Gus
I hear you moved into town
CHASE
I wanted to get Geoff out of
LA Just start things over you
know

Gus nods Now his eyes fall on Renees headstone

GUS
I remember when Renee left She
couldnt wait to get out of
Ludlow She used to say that
life moved too slow here

Chase forces a smile

CHASE
Thats Renee alright

GUS
I suppose so

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Lazy oaks embrace a vintage two-story Victorian home in the rural
neighborhood of Ludlow Maine A commercial MOVING VAN is parked
out front

Marjorie the girl we saw at Renees funeral is coming down the
sidewalk She checks the address on the front of the house then

heads up the driveway

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

Moving boxes clutter the downstairs

Chase is weaving through the maze doing an inventory on the
boxes

A sweaty PAIR OF MOVERS are climbing up the stairs Each is
hunched over with a garment box balanced on his back The side
of each carton is boldly labeled RENEE - ATTIC

MOVER (0S)
Weve got six more of these You
sure you want them all in the
attic

Chase is contemplating a compromise when Geoff appears from the
kitchen doorway

CHASE
Geoff what if we just give
the clothes to Goodwill Well
keep the rest Just the clothes

Geoff shakes his head firm and deliberate denial

GEOFF
Youre the one who wanted to move
Nobody wouldve touched them if
you didnt want to move here

Chase weakens giving in

CHASE
All the Renee boxes go in the
attic Sorry

Marjorie KNOCKS on the open frame of the front door

Geoff recognizes her from his mothers funeral She flashes him a
warm smile

MARJORIE
Hi Im Marjorie Hargrove Your
new housekeeper

Marjorie has a naive friendly quality about her Shes also
blessed with eye-popping genetics Standing there outside the
door looking more than a little nervous we cant help but like
her Needless to say she doesnt look like your typical
housekeeper

MARJORIE
(re Chases reaction)
Is something wrong

CHASE
Uh no You just look
different than you sounded on the
phone Please come in

Marjorie enters She grins at Geoff again Yep Shes nervous
alright

MARJORIE
Im real excited about working
for you Mr Matthews

CHASE
Well were glad to have you
Marjorie You can call me Chase
by the way

Marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of Renees garment
containers

MARJORIE
Ive always admired Ms Hallow
That scene she did in Blue
Midnight where her lover meets
her at the train station
(she sighs)

I mustve watched that movie four
times

Chase smiles Marjories enthusiasm is endearing
Just then one of the movers loses his grip A garment box bounces
down the slope of the stairs When it reaches the bottom dresses

spill over the floor

MARJORIE
Oh Ill get that

Marjorie moves for the spill The first dress she touches is a
beaded peach evening gown Her fingers linger on the fabric

MARJORIE
This is gorgeous She wore this
at the Emmys didnt she

Geoff moves forward acting overly defensive
GEOFF
Hey dont touch her stuff It
made her crazy when people touched
her stuff
Marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of Geoffs statement

Chase catches her eye shrugging apologetically

A VAN is parked outside The rear side panel is masked off with
tape and a stencil Chase grabs the corner of the tape and
carefully peels it back revealing a crisp new business logo

ROUND THE CLOCK ANIMAL DOC

EXT TOWN - DAY

ESTABLISHING Shops and businesses situated around a lazy town
square QUiet Relaxed As rural as they come
WE pick up Chases van as it cruises by
EXT VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY
Chase pulls the van in front of an unassuming veterinary office

On the door is Chases nameplate And on the weathered wall is an
outline of letters where the name and title Quentin Yolander
Doctor of Veterinary Medicine once was

Geoff is first out of the van
INT EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Geoff and Chase move inside The offices look like they were built
in the 40s A dark corridor stretches down the center of the
suite Faded green walls are solid with few exteriors Its
creepy in here

Heavy grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does
find its way in Nothing looks like its been updated in the past
fifty years

CHASE
This doesnt look so bad

Chase sweeps a curtain aside revealing the interior to Geoff
Dust swirls in the air

GEOFF
How long ago did this guy retire

CHASE
Its been a few years

Geoff takes a look around growing uncomfortable

GEOFF
(skeptical)
A few

Geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow
darker and more dismal with every step He moves on into the
boarding room

INT BOARDING AREA - DAY

Rows of kennels are stacked along the walls smothered with
cobwebs Ancient rusted surgical equipment is scattered
everywhere The place is a mess Windows are boarded up and
shadows cloak the room

Over to the right Geoff hears a RUSTLING

A CARDBOARD BOX on one of the shelves jiggles Something is moving
around inside it
Geoffs eyes widen Still morbid curiosity propels him forward
The box rustles again He reaches for it and

A CREATURE LEAPS out at him HOWLING Geoff SCREAMS and jumps
back The box tumbles over and

A CAT crawls out Behind the protective mother are four of the
cutest kittens weve ever seen MEWING away

Geoff sighs just as Chase rushes into the room

CHASE

Whats wrong
GEOFF
(embarrassed)

Nothing I just got spooked by a
bunch of furballs

Inside the box is a note Chase reaches for it It reads And a
warm welcome to you

CHASE
Great now Ive opened an
orphanage too

One of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at Geoff with
sleepy eyes Her fur is striped

GEOFF
Well Ill take one If its
okay

Geoff lifts the fragile creature cradling it in his arms

GEOFF
She looks like a tiger

Chase spies an old broom resting in the corner
CHASE
Tell you what you do some
sweeping up here and shes yours
Geoff nods and Chase moves back out into the hallway
Geoff sets the box back upright and lowers Tiger in with the other
kittens He reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away

the cobwebs

Just as soon as he turns his back Tiger climbs the side of the
box spilling over onto the floor

INT EXAMINATION ROOM
Chase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies When he places
them in the cabinet he stirs up a layer of dust

Tiger scampers by as Chase coughs his way out of the cloud of
dust

INT WAITING AREA

Tiger sees the front door ajar And as she approaches to explore
what lies beyond--

The door swings open
ZOWIE A SIBERIAN HUSKY is staring back at her Hes black and
white with blue eyes with a mask that is at once menacing and

majestic

A pudgy thirteen year old boy DREW has a hold of the dogs
collar

Zowies BARK sends Tiger scrambling

Drew loses his grip as Zowie yanks free A strong paternal
command calls after Drew from outside

VOICE (0S)
Drew you get a handle on that
dog now

INT EXAMINATION ROOM

Chase spins around at the commotion as Tiger darts across the
floor with the barking dog in pursuit

Mayhem ensues as Zowies big paws slip on the slick tile
Geoff rushes in from the boarding area
Tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney

Zowies snoot wedges beneath the base inches from Tigers tiny
striking paw

Drew slides in on his knees renewing his hold on Zowies collar
He pulls the dog back

Geoff rescues Tiger from beneath the gurney
Drew shrugs sheepishly

DREW
Sorry He gets kinda hyper

Drews stepfather Gus Gilbert enters The dreaded domineering
voice of authority in Drews life WE know him as the sheriff at
Renees funeral
GUS

Hell he thought it was lunch
How ya doin Chase

(a handshake)
You havent met my boy

(aside)
Drew where the hell are your
manners

Drew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to Chase Then
Geoff The boys shake

GEOFF
Hes a cool lookin dog

Zowie lurches forward eager to shower affection on Geoff Geoff
strokes the dogs soft mane

GEOFF
Whats his name

DREW
Zowie

Drew puts his palm under Zowies chin and turns him for Chase to
see There are several scabbed-over gashes on his left cheek

GUS
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my
rabbits and they ganged up on him
I swear that dogs an idiot

DREW
Is he gonna be okay

With one eye on Zowie Chase sprays some antiseptic on the
examination table and wipes it clean

CHASE
Lets have him hop up here

Drew prods Zowie Zowie jumps up onto the table Chase looks over
the facial lacerations then turns on a penlight and examines the
dogs eyes

Gus passes a lingering look over Tiger He reaches in to pet her
making sure it meets with Geoffs approval

GUS
When I was young I thought cats
were the girls and dogs were the
boys

CHASE
There are three more girls where
that one came from looking for
homes
Drew perks up at the thought but Gus shoots it down

Gus
Not our home

Chase takes the light out of Zowies eyes He looks to Gus

CHASE
Thee facial lacerations should heal
up pretty quickly Ill give you
som antibiotic cream--

Gus
--Drew hes your dog Are you
listening to this

Chase turns to Drew and continues

CHASE
His left eye is scratched corneal
abrasion Eyedrops will help but
its going to take som time Try
to keep him away from those
rabbits huh

Drew nods casting a glance aside at Gus

Gus
(to Chase)
I hear youve got Marjorie
Hargrove working for you now

CHASE
Howd you know that

Gus gives Chase a knowing grin

Gus
Its a small town Chase

Gus laughs and claps Chase on the shoulder

Gus
Hey Geoff did you know your
mother and I used to be high-
school sweethearts

Geoff is surprised at this Surprised and annoyed Tact isnt a
quality that Gus possesses in abundance

GEOFF
Really

Gus

EXT SCHOOL - DAY

Geoff reaches for the door but Chase stops him Hes trying to
reach his son He really is

CHASE

Geoff you have to help me out
here a little

MEOW Chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in
Geoffs jacket He cant help but smile

CHASE
Are you sure you dont want me to
pick you up Its a long ride

Geoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his MOUNTAIN
BIKE

GEOFF
Thats what my bikes for

Before Chase can say another word Geoff is gone

EXT VAN - DAY
As Chase pulls away WE SEE the handmade sign taped in the back
window

PRICELESS KITTENS
FREE TO A GOOD HOME

EXT SCHOOL - DAY

Drew is among a small circle of BOYS He recognizes Geoff walking
his bike from the van The largest of the boys CLYDE takes
notice of the unfamiliar face

Clyde is fifteen going on twenty You know the type local bully
held back a year or two

CLYDE
Check it out Thats the new kid
The son of that movie star

Mischief gleams in Clydes eyes as he watches Geoffs every move
The other boys follow suit Clyde always takes the lead

Geoff fields their penetrating stares For a second his eyes
connect with Clydes then he moves on into the building

Among the boys Drew is the reluctant participant
INT CLASSROOM - DAY
MRS GORDON is addressing a room of SEVENTH GRADERS

Geoff is doodling in his notebook feeling acutely out of place as
he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new
classmates are giving him

MRS GORDON
People this is Geoff Matthews
Hell be joining our class for the
rest of the school year

As Mrs Gordon points to him Geoff drops his face even lower
This is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer Hed like
to throttle Mrs Gordon

A freckle-faced boy DOUG fires off a question

DOUG
Hey whats Hollywood like Do
you know Eddie Murphy

GEOFF
(annoyed)
No

MRS GORDON
Why dont we save that for later
Doug
A girl with braces SUSAN continues the interrogation

SUSAN
What about Julia Roberts

MRS GORDON
Susan Thatll be enough

Susan shuts up Geoff sinks even lower in his seat
The kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room
But one classmates eyes are still on Geoff Its Clyde

Clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in Geoffs jacket He
catches a glimpse of Tigers bobbing nose popping out

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Geoff joins the stampede of kids as the BELL releases them for the
day Almost immediately Clyde and his cronies STEVIE AND BRAD
fall in step behind him Drew hangs slightly off to the side not
really wanting to be a part of the intimidation

CLYDE
Whats the hurry Junior Where
you off to

Clyde quickens his pace pulling ahead of Geoff and stopping in
front of him Stevie and Brad move in on either side Surrounded
by peers its apparent how small Geoff is for his age

On the wall next to them is a bulletin board display Clyde
glances at it Geoff follows his gaze

DISPLAY

Its one of those corny school affairs with construction paper
letters spelling out WE REMEMBER RENEE HALLOW Beneath that are
pictures of Renee clipped from various magazines Cloyingly
tasteless

CLYDE
(feigning remorse)
Too bad about your Mom Papers
said it was pretty gross getting
fried like that Guess you saw
it huh

Geoff nods Clyde raises his eyebrows pulling Geoffs jacket
open

CLYDE
So what are you hiding there
STEVIE
When you bring a friend to school
youre supposed to introduce him

Geoffs arm tightens protectively around Tiger

GEOFF
Her names Tiger

CLYDE
Tiger Dont you think thats
kind of a pussy name
(reaching out)
Can I hold her I promise Ill be
real careful

Clyde has a convincing way about him Geoff reluctantly hands the
kitten over Clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would
never question his sincerity

Geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in
Clydes tone something sinister

CLYDE
Hey Geoff You ever seen a
kitten run

GEOFF
Ive seen her run around the
house

Clydes eyes narrow He takes a couple of steps back Geoffs
heart starts to sink

CLYDE
No I mean really run
(beat)
Like this

Clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with Tiger Brad
and Stevie fall in behind him laughing

Drew shrugs apologetically Hes torn but he tears off after them
nonetheless

GEOFF
Shit

Geoff runs off in pursuit of them

EXT SCHOOL - DAY

Geoff rushes from the building searching the dispersing crowd
There they are tearing from the bike racks pedaling for the

street

Clyde sees Geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as
they ride by
Geoff runs for the bike racks
EXT ROAD - DAY

Clyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town riding out
onto the open road

Clyde glances back toward the center of town

Geoff is so far behind hes barely visible

Clyde returns his eyes to the road ahead raising Tiger nose to
nose with him

CLYDE
Having fun yet

Clyde and his smirking buddies ride on OUT OF FRAME
WITH GEOFF

giving the pedals all he can struggling to keep pace with the
boys

35 OMITTED
FURTHER ALONG

Scattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead Cochran Lake
stretches into the distance beyond the housing

Clydes clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a
residential property The two-story house is weathered and boarded
up It looks vaguely familiar Creepy

And when WE FIND the mailbox post we know why The name is faded
but theres no question who once lived there Five bold letters
CREED

Geoff whips by in a blur still in pursuit

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes Theyve taken
position on top of the slope of the hill standing at the foot of
THE PATH TO THE PET SEMATARY

38 OMITTED

EXT PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY

Geoff pulls his bike to a stop short of the boys He dismounts and
leans it up against a tree

GEOFF
Just give me the cat all right

A devilish grin creeps over Clyde He strolls down the path toward
Geoff Clyde grabs Geoffs handlebars and backing up pulls Geoff
and the bike with him

CLYDE

I would but there was a little
accident

(feeding off Geoffs

alarm)
She was trying to get away You
know running down my leg and
her head got too close to the
spokes Pretty gross Whats
left of her is up in the Pet
Sematary A zip-lock bag might
help

(shrugs)
but I happen to be out of them
at the moment

Drew shakes his head disgusted he has to put up with Clydes
antics

DREW
Come on Clyde just tell him
where the cat is

CLYDE
(turning on Drew)
I TOLD HIM where the cat is
Now shut up fuck-face

Clyde punches Drew in the arm Drew shrinks back
Geoff flashes a hateful stare at Clyde

All of the boys but Clyde are uncomfortably silent Theres
something frightening about Clyde something that extends beyond
the standard bully antics We begin to get the feeling that this
kid is genuinely deranged

CLYDE
(relishing the
moment)
You heard about the Creed murders
yet And the place where the dead
come back to life

He motions to the path behind him

CLYDE
(continuing)
Its just back there Just down
that path
DREW
(meekly)
Clyde its not funny anymore

CLYDE
Oh So you got a problem
Whatre you gonna do fat-ass You
gonna sic big bad old Gus after
me

Drew shuts up Clyde turns back to Geoff drawing closer

CLYDE
What do you think Geoff Maybe
you could dig up your Mom and take
her back there Maybe if you pray
real hard shell come back

With this last remark Clyde has pushed too far Geoffs face is
red with anger

GEOFF
(quietly)

Just give me the cat ass-hole

Clydes grin falters a moment

CLYDE
Excuse me maybe Im a little hard
of hearing but did you just call

me an ass-hole

Clyde pokes Geoff in the shoulder
CLYDE
You mad Geoff Cause if you are
you should take a shot at me
This time Clyde shoves Geoff back even harder
CLYDE
Come on you pussy Whats the

matter with you

Clyde moves forward again and Geoff suddenly LASHES OUT catching
everyone off guard

For an instant Drew marvels at Geoffs tenacity
Clyde LUNGES He hammers Geoff with blows

Outsizing him by forty pounds Clyde tosses Geoff to the ground
Geoff struggles but Clydes grip proves arresting

Clyde throws Geoff onto his stomach forcing his face into the
dirt It looks as if hes ready to smother his opponent
Drew is the first to rush in Brad and Stevie quickly follow It
takes all three of them to peel Clyde off Geoff

Clyde gets to his feet and backs away Theres great pleasure in
his crazed eyes as he watches Geoff coughing and gasping

CLYDE
Fuckin ass-hole

Satisfied hes handed out enough ill will for the day Clyde turns
away

Drews attentions remain on Geoff As Clyde strolls by he grabs
Drews arm and swings him around

CLYDE
This way fat-boy

Stevie and Brad follow As the group passes Geoffs bike Clyde
gives it a kick knocking it over Then theyre gone

Geoff pulls himself to his feet Brushing off the mess he heads
up the path in search of Tiger

EXT PET SEMATARY - DAY

The woods here have grown long with shadows The air is still and
the sound of birds is conspicuously absent

A WOODEN ARCHWAY frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard
Scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a childs barely
legible attempt at PET SEMATARY

Geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude crowded graves
Collars leashes bird cages and other accessories adorn the
makeshift crosses and headstones

Geoff moves along the outer circle of markers each crafted by a
childs caring hands

As he searches he cant help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs
On the outer circle he sees a crate-board marker memorializing
SMUCKY THE CAT HE WAS OBEDIANT

MOVING INWARD the markers are older The ones he can still read
convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death

Here is a wide flat upright board planted deep in the earth In
Memory of MARTA our Pet Rabit Dyed March 1 1965

The next three rows are illegible the inscriptions are weathered
beyond recognition And then chiseled into sandstone HANNAH
THE BEST DOG THAT EVER LIVED 1929-1939

And now MEOW Faint But very much alive

Geoff picks up his pace weaving quickly toward the center
There he finds Tiger Trapped in a rusted old birdcage its base
swallowed by the grave

Geoff opens the door and frees Tiger stroking the trembling
kitten

Geoffs eyes are drawn to the far perimeter to the deadfall

THE DEADFALL looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of
skeletal remains An abstract stairway to things beyond A wind
picks up just then sending leaves skittering in waves across the
ground

EXT PET SEMATARY PATH - DAY

When Geoff turns around he finds Drew waiting for him under the
archway Drew smiles full of respect for Geoff

DREW
Ive never seen anybody punch
Clyde before

GEOFF
(shrugs)
He pissed me off

DREW
(his smile fading)
Sorry about your mom
(beat)
I couldnt handle not having my
mom around Just having Gus

He grimaces at the thought

GEOFF
My dads not so bad

Drew glances around at all the makeshift grave markers

DREW
I swear sometimes I wish Gus was
dead
GEOFF
(serious)

You shouldnt ever say that about
your parents not even your Dad

DREW
Stepdad Gus is my stepdad

Geoff nods knowingly
GEOFF
What was all that stuff about dead
people coming back to life

DREW
Nothing Its just an old ghost
story Lets get out of here
They head off full of childhood
INT KITCHEN - DUSK

Marjorie is at the stove fixing up dinner while Chase scans the
newspaper at the table

Geoff enters through the kitchen door He moves past them without
a word

CHASE
(calling after him)
Hey How was your first day at

school
GEOFF
(over his shoulder)
It sucked
MARJORIE

Now is that any way to talk to
your father

Geoff stops for a moment turns

GEOFF
Youre not my mother

and exits through the opposite door
Chase looks to Marjorie and offers a sympathetic shrug

CHASE
Sorry

EXT DREWS HOUSE - DUSK

CRUDE CAGES HOUSE DOZENS OF RABBITS Situated alongside the
garage A sign above the cages reads PET RABBITS - 1000 Bells
positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play

Gus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage

Finishing it off he hangs the plug next to an outside socket
Moving onto the next chore he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into

feeding slots for the hungry rabbits

Setting the feed aside he takes a seat Opening one of the cages
he grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap gently petting its soft
fur
One of the cages starts to vibrate

Gus gives it a look A PAIR OF RABBITS arent interested in
eating theyre joined in fast and furious passion

Gus gets a chuckle out of the sight

Gus
Way to go Romeo

Gus replaces the rabbit in the hutch And before he goes HE SINKS
THE PLUG INTO THE SOCKET An ELECTRICAL CHARGE dances along the
base of the cage a deterrent for intruders
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Drews mother AMANDA withdraws a roast from the oven
Gus is at the sink washing his hands He turns to see Zowie
laying at Drews feet in the living room Drew is watching a MUSIC
VIDEO on TV
GUS
Drew I dont remember inviting

Zowie in for dinner

DREW
Just until he heals up

Gus is waggling his thumb toward the back door

Drew slumps in defeat

Gus reaches into the cabinet and pours himself a Bourbon

EXT DREWS HOUSE - NIGHT

Drew walks Zowie from the house with a dish of dog food As they
pass the rabbit dens Zowie alters his path Drew gets a handful

of his collar and pulls him back

Across the yard is an enclosed dog run Twenty feet long by ten
feet wide Drew puts Zowie inside with the dog food

Drew strokes Zowies mane affectionately then backs away closing
the wood-framed door to the dog run

INT DREWS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Amandas about to put the roast on the table when Gus nuzzles up
behind her breathing down her backside With his drink in hand
he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of

the neck

Gus eases his free hand around between Amanda and the counter and
presses his palm firmly into her crotch drawing her body tight to
him

She stiffens at his intimate hold uncomfortable with his timing

AMANDA
Gus please

At the back door Drew is watching from beyond the screen
disgusted by the sight of Gus pawing his mother Drew swings the
door open as loud as he can to signal his return

Gus plants a last kiss on the back of Amandas neck and backs off
But before he goes he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving
platter Leveling his leering eyes at Amanda he stuffs it into
his mouth suggestively

GUS
God damn youre good

Drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table returning his
attention to the TV where another MUSIC VIDEO is on

Gus glances at the TV annoyed by the MUSIC He drops into his
spot at the head of the table blocking Drews view Drew leans to
the side for a better look Gus takes notice and leans to the same
side to obstruct his view

GUS
Youre breaking the law here
Drew

AMANDA

Really Gus It wont bother me

Gus ignores her inching forward with a confidential harsh
whisper

GUS
Your moms spent the last hour
cooking Stop being a little jerk
and show her some appreciation

Drew aims the remote control at Gus as if to shut him up and
silences the TV

Amanda approaches with the roast The moment its on the table
Drew starts dishing up a hefty serving Gus spears Drews fork
with the serving fork

GUS
Not that much appreciation I
thought we were gonna tone down
that flabby ass

DREW
Hey Im so sorry Im not the stud
that you are

AMANDA
Knock it off guys

Gus throws back a sip of Bourbon

GUS
(to Drew quietly)
You watch that mouth of yours
Drew buddy

EXT ZOWIES DOG RUN - NIGHT

MOVING THROUGH Zowies enclosed pen WE SEE no sign of the dog
REACHING the door WE FIND that the wood around the bottom hinge
has been chewed through The base of the door is ajar just enough
for a dog to have slipped through

EXT RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT

In the still of the night Gus rabbit pens sit unattended And
then WE HEAR the tinkling of dog tags Snoozing rabbits awaken as
Zowie lumbers INTO FRAME

Zowie rises on his hind legs pressing his paws to a cage Blue
sparks fly as Zowie is jolted with the electrical charge

INT GUS ROOM - NIGHT

The ELECTRICAL ZING The dogs whimpering CRY And the RINGING OF
BELLS reach Gus in rapid succession rousting him from his sleep
He rolls out of bed and grabs his robe

GUS
Damn it Drew That dog is
history
Amanda stirs groggily focusing on Gus departing figure

INT DREWS ROOM - NIGHT

Drew swings open the door to the hallway as Gus marches by
stuffing shells into a shotgun Panicked Drew takes off after
him

EXT RABBIT CAGES - NIGHT

Zowie swings his head in the direction of the house as Gus bursts
through the back door Drew is one step behind

Gus swings the gun up and fires off a SHOT

Zowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside
Drew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle

DREW
Dont shoot him

Gus eyes are wild with anger

GUS
What Drew What did you say

Gus throws Drew aside brings the rifle back up and FIRES another
random shot after the fleeing dog All the while his eyes remain
on Drew as if this were the boys lesson to be learned

He squeezes off one more SHOT

A PAINED YELP echoes from the hillside Zowies yelp

Drew whips his head aside in sickened shock Even Gus is sobered
by the unexpected hit

All they can hear now are Zowies WHIMPERING CRIES diminishing in
the night

Drew shoots Gus a look of such unbridled hatred that Gus is
speechless He backs away from Gus and darts off toward the dark
hillside

When Gus turns back for the house Amanda is standing there

AMANDA
Jesus Gus what have you done

Gus
Ah come on Amanda stop looking
at me like that Hes had ample
warning about that dog

Amanda glares at him an outpouring of pent-up strain

Gus defiantly marches past Amanda entering the house without ever
meeting eyes with her

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Drew pauses long enough to listen for Zowie

Nothing until a FAINT CRY drifts back at him

DEEPER IN THE WOODS

Zowie limps INTO FRAME Blood is flowing from the bullet wound in
his left hindquarter trailing from his suspended leg Every step

is a strain

DREW
comes upon a break in the trees The hanging moon outlines the
knoll stretching beyond And then the strained breathing the
hushed WHIMPER

Drew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll

Zowie is just beyond lying on his side at the end of the bloody
trail His chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every

effort to survive

Drew drops to his knees at Zowies side and cradles the dog in his
lap shaking his head in denial

Zowies weak eyes shift gazing longingly at Drew

Drew strokes the fur under Zowies chin hardly able to see the
dog through his glaze of tears

Zowies eyes drift off His chest falls and doesnt rise again He
falls limp in Drews arms Drew hugs Zowie even tighter and he
begins to weep

FROM A DISTANCE

WE SEE the image of Drew with the dog cradled in his arms
silhouetted against the moonlit horizon

EXT GEOFFS HOUSE - MORNING

Geoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the
road A WHISTLE catches his ear

Drew is at the edge of the woods beckoning for Geoff
Geoff circles around and doubles back

GEOFF
I was just going by your house
Wheres your bike

The closer Geoff gets the more he sees of Drews despair Then he
sees the dried blood staining Drews clothes

DREW
Zowies dead

Geoffs heart sinks An unspoken moment of sympathy passes between
the boys Fighting the emotions Drew finally speaks

DREW
I have to bury him I dont want
to go out there alone
Theres such grief in Drews words that Geoff cant resist He
glances toward his house to make sure he hasnt been seen then
blends into the woods

EXT PET SEMATARY - DAY

Drew carries Zowies relaxed form in his arms Geoff is following
balancing a pickaxe and shovel

Arriving at the graveyard Geoff searches the outer perimeter for
a vacant stretch of soil Finding one he lets the heavy tools
fall to the ground

GEOFF
Is this a good spot

DREW
Im not burying him here

GEOFF
Why not

DREW
Theres a better place

Drew heads for the base of the deadfall with Zowie in his arms

DREW
Its back here somewhere through
the Indian woods I know we can
find it

Drew continues up the deadfall disappearing over the crest
Geoff gathers up the shovel and pickaxe and follows after him

GEOFF
Hey wait up

EXT THE BOG - DAY
Geoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall

Beyond is a dark swamp A BOG looking unlike anything one would
expect in Maine Tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation
that looks almost prehistoric Gnarled trees rise up from the
murky earth blocking the sun from view

Geoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with
Drew Somewhere off in the distance we hear an UNEARTHLY SOUND
Not a bird Not any animal known to man

Spectral shapes flicker at the edge of Geoffs vision sinking
back into the shadows as Geoff tries to focus on them

GEOFF
(uneasy)
Drew where are we going

Drew doesnt respond He continues on without another word hell-
bent on finding this better place

FURTHER ALONG - DAY

At the boundary of the bog A STAIRWAY OF HUGE WIDE STONES rises
from the blanket of ground fog Bordered by fir trees Leading up
the hillside The final leg of Drew and Geoffs journey

DREW
This is it I wasnt sure if it
even really existed

GEOFF
What did

DREW
The old Indian burial ground

Geoffs eyes move to the stairway of stones

GEOFF
Come on thats just a bullshit
story You said so yourself

DREW
What if its not bullshit If I
bury Zowie there and it works
(beat)
-hell come back alive

GEOFF
Drew I know your dog died but
get a grip man youre freaking
me out

DREW
Look if there was even one chance
in a million itd work wouldnt
you want to try

Geoff feels for Drew Its pointless to reason

Drew starts up the stone steps Geoff has no choice but to follow
EXT MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DAY

Even in broad daylight the flat-topped mesa has a sense of
foreboding isolation Theres an almost palpable sense of
wrongness about this place As if the darkness of a dying black

hole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth

Drew and Geoff approach the circle of rocky soil They stand at
the border looking it over in eerie silence
Somewhere off in the distance we hear the unearthly SOUND again
only this time its closer

GEOFF
Look lets just get this over
with

Even Drew seems to have awakened from the haze he had fallen into
He gently sets Zowies body on the ground

DREW
If this doesnt work dont ever
tell anyone I did this okay You
gotta promise

Geoff nods and hands over the digging tools Drew swings the
pickaxe sinking it into the ground

GEOFF
You want me to help

DREW
You have to bury your own Thats
the way the Indians did it Its
like a rule

Backing away from the burial ground Geoff takes a seat on a rock
at the border of the forest From there he watches

Drew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the
rocky ground

WE MOVE IN ON GEOFF whos looking on with skeptical intrigue as
the rhythmic SOUND of the tools continues

59 OMITTED

LATER -

A cairn is complete a conical pile of rocks over Zowies grave
Drew is now sitting on the rock next to Geoff Together they
stare at the cairn as if Zowie might climb from beneath at any

moment

DREW
What if he really does come back

Geoff shrugs pondering such a thought

Geoff digs into his pocket and produces a pack of gum offering
one to Drew With only a quick glance away from the grave Drew
snatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth Geoff does the
same

They sit together in silence Nervously chewing their gum
Watching the grave
DREW
Ive never had anyone die
before
(beat)
-but I guess you get over it I
mean eventually

GEOFF
(quietly)
You never get over it

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - AFTERNOON

The sun dips over the horizon giving way to dusk

EXT MICMAC BURIAL GROUND - DUSK

Geoffs eyes shift from the grave to the darkening sky

GEOFF

better go

DREW

Yeah

They rise leaving the burial ground En route Drew pauses for a
last look at the grave

DREW
So long Zowie

Geoff follows glancing back at the burial ground It looks
magical in the twilight not quite so sinister now

EXT ROAD - NIGHT
Drew is walking home along the road alone

Headlights blind him as a car approaches It slows and pulls a U-
turn stopping at Drews side Its Gus squad car He pushes open
the passenger door

GUS
Get in

Drew takes a step back shaking his head

GUS
Your mommas worried sick over
you You take off in the middle
of the night you dont show up
for school Whatre you trying to
prove
DREW
Im not trying to prove anything
(beat)
I was burying my dog
Gus turns his eyes away focusing on the dark road ahead

GUS
Life is full of lessons No ones
above it Not you Not me
Now get in the car

After a moment Drew approaches the car Without another word Gus
drives off

EXT RABBIT CAGE - NIGHT

Its quiet now And out of the silence comes the JINGLING of
Zowies dog tags Zowies LONG SHADOW creeps over the cage
distorted to monstrous proportion by the flickering light

We move past the cages to the back porch

We see ZOWIES PAW scratching at the door

INT AMANDA AND GUS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Amanda wakens with a start She rises eyes focusing on the dark
bedroom Gus is sound asleep next to her Then from outside we

faintly hear ZOWIES SCRATCHING

Slowly Amanda rises from bed pulling on a bathrobe as she heads
for the door

EXT BACK PORCH - NIGHT
Amanda appears at the door She unlatches it stepping outside

AMANDA
Zowie

Amanda looks down and SCREAMS

INT DREWS ROOM - NIGHT

Photos of Drew with Zowie are tacked on the wall above the bed
The one photo of Drew Amanda and Gus has been altered with a cut-
out head of Zowies pasted on Gus shoulders

WE FIND Drew below Hes fallen asleep with his Walkman on Even
with his ears covered the POUNDING at the door jolts him awake
Half asleep Drew peels off the headphones

GUS (0S)
Drew you unlock this door Right
now

AMANDA (0S)
Unlock it Drew

The anger in his mothers voice brings him off the bed Gus
POUNDING continues

Drew moves to the door The inside is secured by a double dead
bolt Instead of unlocking them he opens a tiny customized
window which gives him a view of the hall

DREW
What did I do now

AMANDA
Open the door Drew

Drew unlatches the deadbolts and steps back as Gus bursts through
the door

GUS
Where do you come off lying like
that Im burying my dog You
think a lie like thats never
gonna catch up to you

Drew backs into the bed taking a seat
Amanda comes through the door and behind her is

ZOWIE

This is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog Fur shiny and
wet the gaping gunshot wound in his rear Zowies head hangs low
his eyes GLEAMING RED The husky is covered with dirt from head to
toe

Drews eyes widen in astonishment

Zowie staggers across the room towards Drew nails clicking on the
floorboards Drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog
moves closer

Zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed across Drews lap
And slowly perfunctory his tongue licks Drews cheek This last
action of Zowie displaces Drews fear Tears well up in the boys
eyes

DREW
(a whisper)
Zowie

GUS
Say your goodbyes Zowies going
outside Youre grounded buddy
Thats the new law
Drew lifts his hand from stroking Zowies fur His palm is covered
with muddy blood

AMANDA

I never knew an open wound could
smell so bad

(beat)
Honey he should have been looked
at this morning I dont know
what you were thinking Its a
wonder hes still alive

Drew gazes into the dogs vacant eyes It truly is a wonder

INT GEOFFS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Chase enters and stops in the doorway

Geoff sits in front of the television with a pile of videotapes
next to him Hes scanning through Renees old movies with the
remote The sound has been turned down and the effect is a little
eerie

ON THE SCREEN

We see RENEE move through a scene Geoff hits the slo-mo button
and the image winds down Renees face HER EYES stare out at us
from the alien universe of the past

Geoff doesnt respond Hes captivated by Renee

Chase moves into the room

slightly For an instant we think we see a FLASH OF Renee being

electrocuted But its only an instant

fathers intrusion

Tiger is curled up at the foot of Geoffs bed Geoff climbs in
careful not to disturb the kitten As he lays his head back on the
pillow

VOICE (0S)

Sleep tight darling Ill be

with you soon
Its a womans VOICE A familiar one Now we hear the rhythmic
CREAK of a rocking chair And with it comes the voice again
humming a HAUNTING LULLABY
Wide-eyed Geoff turns his head toward the source
A WOMANS NONDESCRIPT FORM is seated in the rocking chair across
the room Rocking forward her face passes into a swath of

moonlight

Its Renee With the rock of the chair her face recedes back into
the shadows Her soothing HUM remains

And again her face passes into the swath of light And again it
retreats

Geoff raises his hand reaching out for her

Renees hand rises from the shadows reaching for him

But suddenly THE ROOM BEGINS TO STRETCH

The rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes
mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their

control

LIGHTNING FLASHES in the bedside window Renee is falling farther
and farther away

GEOFF
Mom

Geoff leaps from his bed as the darkness closes in and

GEOFF

bolts up from his pillow Awake now face wet with perspiration
It was a nightmare Except if it was a nightmare why do we still
hear

the steady CREAK of the rocking chair

Geoff slowly turns his head once again repeating the actions of
his dreams

In the shadows the chair is still rocking As it comes forward
into the moonlight we see ZOWIE curled up asleep on the seat of
the chair
Tiger is not on the bed anymore Shes up on top of the bookcase
now wide awake eyes fixed on the dog She HISSES

Geoff stares at the rocking chair petrified

gooey and open

Geoff reads the concern in Chases expression Drew is right there
at Geoffs side looking on

DREW
Whats the deal

CHASE
I dont know Hes had three
days His immune system shouldve
responded by now

Chase puts on his stethoscope and checks under the dogs rib-cage
for a pulse He checks a number of places then shakes his head
totally confused

CHASE
I cant seem to find a pulse it
must be so weak its not

registering

Geoff and Drew share conspiratorial glances as Chase sets the
stethoscope aside and extracts a blood sample

Chase labels the capped vial of blood ZOWIE and carefully places
it into a packing container When he closes the lid we see the

One of the kittens SPATS fearfully at Zowie Geoff turns to stare
at Zowie

EXT PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

Dark clouds paint the foreboding sky A broken pulse of lightning
streaks through the dense haze

Abandoning their bikes next to the path Drew and Geoff approach
the archway The graveyard beyond is deathly silent

They pass beneath the archway entering the clearing
And now a soft chilling VOICE drifts over the graves

VOICE (0S)
Geoff honey Mommys here

Geoff freezes in his tracks awestruck as
A WOMANS BODY

swoops down from the darkness above materializing out of nowhere
A fluttering negligee Flowing blonde hair

RENEES FACE appears out of the shadows masked with sadness
Geoff swallows the lump in his throat
Renees form keeps coming But even as she approaches her visage

grows less distinguishable Just a phantom countenance now A
shadow framed by golden hair resting atop a veiled body
Shes coming so fast that shes upon Geoff in no time He fumbles
back startled out of his wits

THE BODY is upon him now flailing wildly Geoff thrashes and
struggles screaming bloody murder

Gradually he realizes the body isnt fighting back Geoff eases
his struggle lets his scream fall off

Now he hears wild mischievous LAUGHTER

Drew pulls the body away Its just a heavy wad of stuffed
clothing A DUMMY dressed in a negligee capped by a blonde wig
It dangles near the end of a slanted wire

Clyde Stevie Brad and a half dozen other costumed KIDS appear
from the nearby cover of bushes doubled over in laughter

Clyde tugs at a piece of twine thats connected to the back of the
dummys head and makes spooky sounds The dummy jumps around on
the slanted wire

Clyde drops the dummy and saunters forward

CLYDE
Look at this Junior here
practically shit his pants

Clyde drops down nose to nose with Geoff whos still recovering

CLYDE
Maybe youre too chicken to hang
out with the rest of the boys
You gonna run home to Daddy now

Geoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet He stares into
Clydes eyes

GEOFF
Fuck off

Geoff pushes past Clyde and moves on into the graveyard somehow
managing to keep his dignity intact

Drew follows then the rest of the boys leaving Clyde staring
after them standing alone with the dummy

EXT DREWS HOUSE - NIGHT

Gus squad car slows to a stop outside Gus swings open the door
and ambles toward the porch

INT DREWS HOUSE - NIGHT

Amanda draws back from the window mortified She nervously
crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer turning as Gus
enters

AMANDA
Youre home early

GUS
Nope Just ran out of smokes

Gus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes He
fires one up

GUS
Wheres the boy

Amanda squirms

AMANDA
Uh in his room

Gus tightens his brow casting a suspicious eye

A sickened look flushes through Amanda as Gus pulls his eyes away
from her and marches upstairs

GUS (0S)
DREW

His feet POUND down the hallway Silence for an instant Then the
powerful swing of Drews door Followed by Gus hastened return
down the hallway And as he hustles down the stairs

GUS
God damn it Amanda You want me
to be a father to the boy and as
soon as I lay down the law you
let him break it

Gus stops before Amanda

GUS
Where is he

One step away from terror Amanda shakes her head Gus loses his
patience He rips the can of beer from her grip and sends it

flying across the room

GUS
WHERE IS YOUR SON

Amanda sighs in quiet defeat

AMANDA
The Pet Sematary

Gus turns away and heads out the door

EXT DREWS HOUSE - NIGHT
Wheels spin as Gus squad car streaks off into the night The
cherry top glows to life bombarding the countryside

EXT PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

By now nearly TWO DOZEN COSTUMED KIDS have gathered at the Pet
Sematary In the midst of the graves a small story-telling
campfire burns A number of the boys sip beer trying to pretend
that the bitter after-taste doesnt bother them

Clyde sits up front At fourteen hes the elder statesmen of the
group With a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other
Clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn

CLYDE
-yeah that old Louis was one
sick fuck digging up little Gage

like so maggots pouring out of
that kids eyes

Clyde whistles He drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke
ring Sees he still has an audience

CLYDE
Ellie was the only Creed that
lived Then one night a few
months later Ellie freaks out
and she hacks up her grandparents
with an axe

(beat)
Police found her licking their
brains off the blade They

locked her up in a psycho ward and
all she said were two words Pet
Sematary Pet Sematary

Clyde stares at the wide-eyed kids He grins takes a swig of
beer and moves in for the kicker

CLYDE

Oh yeah Almost forgot Heres
the best part Two nights ago she
escapes Word is she was heading
for Maine Man I hope she doesnt
show up out here

(feigning concern)
Shit we wouldnt even notice her
not if shes wearing a costume
She could be one of us

Clyde casts a suspicious eye on the group The kids uneasily look
at each other making sure they know whos behind each and every

costume

Suddenly Clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror
CLYDE
Oh my Goddd

Clyde lifts a trembling finger pointing beyond the group of
spellbound listeners

CLYDE
Its Its

The kids are afraid to turn around assuming Clydes rigged up
some unspeakable terror

And for an instant a look of real horror washes over Clydes
face

A FIGURE

Is coming up the path beneath the archway rising out of the
swirling mist A frightening silhouette backlit by the moon

But then Clyde realizes who it is
CLYDE
Shit Its Drews Dad Its

fuckin Gus

Drew and the others quickly turn around realizing its not part
of the punch-line scare

EXT PET SEMATARY - NIGHT

The kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering
brush dropping their beer cans as fast as they can

As Drew leaps to his feet he upsets the fire knocking one of the
logs A FLAMING EMBER rolls to the base of one of the brittle old
crosses

Drew and Geoff run for it

EXT PATH ARCHWAY - NIGHT

Gus moves quickly up the meandering path sending the blinding
beam of his flashlight over the graves

GUS
You boys better not be drinking

EXT PET SEMATARY - NIGHT
Through the thick woods Drew is flanked by Geoff and Clyde

DREW
Oh man hes gonna kick my ass

Drew starts to take off Clyde trips him on his first stride Drew
hits the dirt

CLYDE
Thanks for fucking up our
Halloween dumbshit

Clyde recedes into the woods as Gus approaches the campfire He
scans the area with his flashlight illuminating the various beer
cans
GUS
Drew you get your ass out here
Front and center

Geoff pulls Drew to his feet

Gus passes the flashlight over the woods Kids duck away
retreating from their hiding places

The flashlight sweeps toward Drew

Drew freezes spotlighted by Gus beam A burst of LIGHTNING
floods Drews horrified face

GUS
Get out here Joker

Geoff remains frozen in the woods nearby out of Gus light
Behind Gus the wooden cross is completely on fire now

GUS
You out here making a fool of me

Drew shakes his head in instant denial
GUS
Im warning you buddy You dont
play by the rules Im gonna

shadow your ass for eternity

Drew makes a break from his spot in the woods He weaves through
the markers arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid Gus

but Gus is quicker He zigzags through the crosses and
headstones to intercept Drew

Gus gets a handful of Drews collar and yanks him in

GUS
You little shit

Gus draws his free arm back and smacks Drew across the face Drew
goes down
GEOFF

is looking on from the woods horrified Torn
DREW

cowers on the ground trying to scramble away

Geoff bolts out into the firelight staring defiantly at Gus in
silent accusation

Gus is beyond furious LIGHTNING flashes again
GUS
You get out of here Geoff
Matthews This is between me and
my boy

Geoff doesnt move Gus starts to advance forward

but the GROWL emanating from the woods gives him pause
Everyone turns

A RUSTLING is heard in the bushes and Zowie emerges into the
building firelight flashing his fangs at Gus His eyes GLOW RED

Gus freezes studying Zowie
Zowie inches forward poised for the attack

GUS
Call off your dog Drew

Drew shifts his eyes from Zowie to Gus too terrified to heed such
a command

Zowie brushes past Drew and Geoff moving in on Gus

Gus eyes shift to burning cross at his side With a swift boot
he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip

Swinging the cross like a primitive weapon Gus connects with the
side of Zowies head

Zowie spins a full circle from the impact But he lands on all
fours Unphased Taking the next step toward Gus Theres
something clearly not of this world in Zowies vicious stare

GUS
(terrified)
Drew call him off

All Drew can manage is a faint appeal

DREW
Zowie
Zowie goes for Gus launching into the air

GUS
DREW

and sinking his glistening fangs into Gus neck
AN ERUPTION OF BLOOD showers the closest headstone

Gus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog His
SCREAMS are suddenly cut short as Zowie rips out his throat His
arms flail weakly at his sides then grow still

Drew and Geoff stare at the scene wide-eyed with shock

Zowie looks up from Gus neck with dripping red fangs For a
moment his eyes settle on Drew Then Zowie bolts off
disappearing into the night

DREW
Oh God Oh God

Drews eyes shift to Geoff whose face is flushed with sickened
fear

GEOFF
(a whisper)
Is he dead

In dazed shock Drew moves in for a closer look at the body
Gus eyes are wide open Blood is still pumping in rhythm from his
jugular with each weakening beat of his heart Its a gruesome

image against the roaring fire

Drew kneels at Gus side He wants to touch him To shake him
awake but with every attempt he draws his hand back

GEOFF
Is he breathing Can you hear him

breathing

Drew leans forward turning his ear toward Gus gaping mouth And
as he inches closer

GUS FINGERS TWITCH

His hand jerks up and closes around Drews neck Gus stares up at
him with his crazed menace

Drew SCREAMS His fingers claw at Gus hand desperate to pry it
loose

but then Gus hand relaxes as his last dying ounce of
strength fades away
Drew shrinks back crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing
firelight dances over it He turns his tear-filled gaze to Geoff

DREW
Oh man Geoff we killed him
we killed him
(beat)

Whatre we gonna do
Geoff draws closer and looks down into the dead mans face

GEOFF
We could bring him back

Drews eyes widen at the suggestion

And now GAZING DOWN on Gus body and on the boys WE PULL UP
INTO A SLOW SPIRAL

We move ever higher until we are LOOKING DOWN UPON THE ENTIRE PET

EXT DREWS HOUSE - NIGHT

Amanda is pacing back and forth on the porch checking her watch
every few steps She sighs with relief as

Drew appears from the darkness of the woods

Drew dismounts his bike and carries it up the front porch steps
strangely silent His clothes and face are caked with dirt

AMANDA
Jesus Drew do you know what time
it is Did Gus ever find you

Drew moves on past her into the house
AMANDA
(calling after him)

Drew Drew what happened

DREW
(trying not to lose
it)
Nothing happened Mom We just
ditched Gus thats all

Drew pauses and stares out into the unknown darkness of the night
INT GEOFFS HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase is in the study perusing some files He looks into the
hallway as Geoff arrives home then glances at the clock Its
late Very late

Chase rises Hes both angry and relieved Right now though the
angers winning out

CHASE
Were you drinking

Geoff absently shakes his head He slumps back against the wall
drained from the nights horrors

CHASE
Drews Mom called hours ago the
rest of the kids were back by ten
Where the hell were you boys

Geoff shrugs trying to mask his uneasiness

GEOFF
Just out
CHASE
Out Well thats great Geoff

weeks but Im not going to stand
for crap like this I dont care
if its Halloween its a school

GEOFF

Im really tired Dad can I just

Chase stops and looks at his son Geoffs exhaustion is self-
evident

CHASE
(sighing)
Go on well talk about this in
the morning

Geoff nods and heads for the stairs
INT GEOFFS ROOM - NIGHT
THE CLOCK is creeping up on 2AM

THUNDER rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter
the window panes

Geoffs eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to
sleep Tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest
Slowly we move back towards the window

In a flash of LIGHTNING--

GUS FACE

APPEARS OUTSIDE Washed in the haunting white glow Streaked with
mud Caked with blood Staring in at Geoff

Geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of THUNDER and whips his
gaze to the window Before he can focus

the pulse of lightning fades away And with it Gus face Only
darkness remains beyond the window pane

Geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom unaware of Gus appearance
He sinks back to his pillow already hurtling towards sleep once
more

EXT DREWS HOUSE - NIGHT

MOVING IN ON the house WE SINGLE OUT a rain-obscured window on
the ground floor the window to Drews bedroom

INT DREWS ROOM - NIGHT

Drew is sound asleep curled up under the sheets He clutches his
pillow like a life preserver

GUS (0S)
Drew

Drews eyes flutter open He turns towards the window Now he
hears some activity outside And then Gus hushed voice

GUS (0S)
Drew buddy I lost my keys

Drew goes saucer-eyed He swallows the swelling lump in his throat
and rises from his bed

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Drew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key
into the deadbolt on the back door Drawing the CREAKING door
open he gazes out back

DREW
(scared shitless)
Gus

Nothing moves outside The longer Drew watches the more eerie
each shadow becomes Spooked Drew steps back inside quickly
closing the door He locks it back up again

When he turns around hes face to face with GUS
Drew stiffens backing into the wall

DREW
H-howd you get in

Gus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand dangling his
keys

Gus
Found ‘em

Drews eyes follow a flow of blood from Gus neck to the floor
Gus looks down at his dirty bloody footprints Hes tracked blood
all over the linoleum

Gus
Im makin a mess of your mothers
kitchen floor
(beat)
I need a shower

Gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs

Drews mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches Gus
clumsily climbing the stairs

After a moment he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen
floor Tearing off a wad of paper towels he wets them and begins
to mop up Gus tracks

103 OMITTED
AT THE MIRROR - NIGHT

Gazing vacantly at his reflection Gus covers his ravaged throat
with a gauze strip wrapping it around the circumference of his
neck again and again and again

Behind him the shower is running filling up the bathroom with
steam

Finishing the dressing off with a sloppy tape job Gus reaches for
the pajamas hanging nearby He lazily buttons the buttons failing
to notice their alignment is off He never did bother to shower
Hes still covered with mud

INT AMANDA AND GUS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Gus enters from the steamy bathroom The shower is still running
Amanda stirs sleepy eyes focusing on him

AMANDA
Gus hon Im sorry about
tonight You coming to bed

Gus lifts the covers and climbs in With him comes the chill of
death Gus presses up behind her His hand moves beneath the
sheets finding its way over the curve of her waist caressing
Amanda shivers

AMANDA
God youre ice cold
(turning)
»-and you smell Lord what did
you get yourself into

Its then that Amanda sees the bandage around Gus neck Blood is
seeping through the gauze

AMANDA
My God Gus what happened

Amanda reaches out to touch him but Gus stops her hand short of
the bandage Instead he leans forward and clutches one of her
breasts

Amanda tries to twist away

AMANDA
Gus stop it Whats wrong with
you

But Gus doesnt stop He throws himself on top of Amanda roughly
forcing her back onto the bed

AMANDA
Gus

Amandas hands beat at Gus face and back to no apparent effect
With one arm forced against Amandas throat he rips open her

nightgown with the other

We pull away from Amandas struggles back to the bathroom The
shower running on and on cloaking the bedroom in steam

EXT ROAD - DAY

Geoff is riding along the highway his backpack full of school
books Drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead When Geoff
approaches Drew hops on his bike getting up to speed

WITH THE BOYS - RIDING

Geoff keeps glancing at Drew waiting for him to say something
Drew maintains his enigmatic expression

GEOFF
Well

Drew nods Geoffs eyes widen in disbelief

DREW
Picture this Gus comes down to
breakfast and he doesnt say a
word He even kind of smiles
like he forgot he hates me And
then you know what he does He
serves me an extra helping of

pancakes

(beat)
I asked him if I was still
grounded no I asked him if

you could spend the night and he
nods Its like were a family
A real family

The words have their own meaning for Geoff who stares to the road
ahead in deep thought

DREW
Its weird

GEOFF
What do you mean

DREW
Its like hes not Gus anymore
Hes different You know like
Zowie

They share a chuckle that ends in silent uneasiness
INT CHASES OFFICE - DAY

Chase enters with a stack of files tucked under his arm As he
organizes them in the large filing cabinet with the others he
listens to his messages on the answering machine

The current caller sounds a little annoyed

Chase abandons the filing and immediately returns the call While
it RINGS

A MOTHER and TWO TODDLERS are standing in the doorway to Chases
office trying not to intrude on his call

MOTHER

boarding area You can go on
back

Chase turns away as his phone call is answered

CHASE

INT LABINT CHASES OFFICE (INTERCUT) - DAY

ELLIOT RUDMAN has the phone tucked under his chin in the midst of
an autopsy The WHIRR of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves
the dome off a dogs skull

CHASE
I didnt get that

The pathologist turns off the saw His words become audible

RUDMAN
-I said next time it might help
if you took the blood sample while
the animal was still alive

The comment hits Chase out of left field

CHASE
What

RUDMAN
I dont know what you expected to
find Matthews Theres nothing
wrong with the antigens nothing
to indicate an unusual death

CHASE
Wait there must be some mix-up
He was the dog is alive
RUDMAN

Not this dog There wasnt enough
oxygen in those red cells to pump
life into a flea
Chase is baffled speechless

RUDMAN
You took over for Doctor Yolander

CHASE
Yes why

RUDMAN
Because the last person that sent
me blood from a dead animal was
Yolander

INT BOARDING AREA - DAY

The kennels have been cleaned up but the room retains its eerie
dimly lit quality

The DRIP of a faucet reverberates from the far corner
The mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand Their
smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings Slowly they move down

the row of kennels

TODDLER
Where are the kitties

INT CHASES OFFICE - DAY
CHASE
(into the phone)

Look this is ridiculous

Suddenly BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAMS pierce the air Chase drops the
phone and rushes out of the office

INT BOARDING AREA - DAY

The toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs Mom is
burying their heads in her dress

Chase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit Her
horrified eyes flash by Chase In an instant she and the toddlers

are gone

Chase remains alone moving down the long row of kennels with
mounting trepidation

Zowies cage is empty

Chase shifts his troubled gaze to the
DRIP DRIP DRIP as a PUDDLE OF BLOOD forms on the floor
Chase raises his eyes
THE KITTENS KENNEL -

Nothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens
dangling from the grid gate DRIPPING

Chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him

CHASE
Jesus

Its too gruesome even for a man of Chases background Fighting
the gag reflex he searches the room for the missing dog

and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor
And the pile of blood-spattered shards laying on the tile

EXT SCHOOL STREET - DAY

Clyde Stevie and Brad are loitering near the front bike racks
Clydes smoking away

As Geoff and Drew come out of the school the trio moves to
intercept them

CLYDE
Hey

Just then Chases van pulls at the curb interrupting whatever
trouble was about to happen

Clyde looks from the van to Geoff and falls back

DREW
Saved by the bell

Chase hurriedly rolls down the passenger window as Geoff and Drew
approach

GEOFF
Can I sleep over at Drews
tonight

Chase is preoccupied with other concerns

CHASE
Yeah thats fine
(beat)
Listen Drew I got the tests back
on Zowie Hes not well Dont
ask me how but he got out this
afternoon

Geoff and Drew exchange concerned looks
CHASE
If he finds his way home call me
no matter what the hour okay And
dont try to approach him
Whatever hes got might be
infectious Understand

The boys nod their heads

Chase masks his anxiety with a weary smile With a wave he speeds
up leaving the boys

INT CHASES VAN - MOVING

A MAP of Maine is unfolded on the passenger seat Chase is on the
car phone

CHASE
Can I have the address for Quentin
Yolander

Chase jots an address down on the map He turns the van up a
mountain road winding through the towering pines

EXT YOLANDERS CABIN - DAY

A remote rustic dwelling nestled into the desolate backwoods

INT YOLANDERS CABIN - DAY

QUENTIN YOLANDER rocks back in his thick hide chair His world is
closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds

Hes holding a SMALL POODLE in his lap Its big brown eyes are
staring back at him

YOLANDER
Youd be so much more interesting
with blue eyes

And now ONE OF THE POODLES EYES POPS OUT Yolanders finger
comes through from beneath the eye socket

On closer examination WE REALIZE that the dog is not alive at
all Yolander has his hand inside the hollowed-out carcass

He carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and
selects the right shade of blue A shot of whiskey rests nearby

Yolander reaches up into the poodles belly and fits the blue eyes
securely into place

Theres a KNOCK at the door Yolander ignores it Maybe hes deaf
Another KNOCK Yolander turns towards the door annoyed at the
intrusion And behind that annoyance theres a touch of madness
PULLING BACK we see the rest of the room Stuffed animals are
crowded from floor to ceiling A product of Yolanders obsession
with TAXIDERMY

YOLANDER
Im immortalizing a poodle State
your business

Yolander presses some stuffing into the poodles gut and begins to
sew up the stomach

CHASE (0S)
Doctor Yolander This is Chase
Matthews Ive moved into your
offices in Ludlow

Yolanders attention remains on the needle as he meticulously
stitches the belly

CHASE (0S)
(continuing)
I sent a blood sample out for
analysis They tell me I sent
them the blood of a dead animal

At this Yolander breaks his concentration The needle pricks his
hand Blood oozes from the puncture dripping onto the dogs
stomach

CHASE (0S)
a dog

Yolander rises from his seat and swings open the door

Chase stands in the doorway startled It doesnt take a genius to
figure out that the good Doctor is drunk

YOLANDER
(glaring)
Why are you bothering me about
this Cant you leave it be

CHASE
I um

Chase glances to the right and steps back
A BOBCAT

is perched nearby frozen in mid-pounce It takes a second for
Chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed

Now Chase sees the rest of the room a whole zoo of stuffed
animals looking like a rural version of the Bates Motel

CHASE
(momentarily thrown)
the pathologist he said that
you had reported a similar
incident with a cat

YOLANDER

The Creed cat thats right
Bastards name was Church

(grins)
Let me guess Your dogs tissue
isnt healing pupils arent
dilating maybe you cant find a
heartbeat

CHASE
Exactly I thought it might be
some sort of blood condition
immune deficiency or

Quentin Yolander laughs Its disconcerting

YOLANDER
Theres no blood condition The
dog isnt sick its dead
(drawing closer)
And so was Creeds cat And so
was his wife the night she was
killed for the second time

As Yolander moves forward Chase backs up He bumps into a whole
shelf of stuffed creatures To his right A RAVEN sits frozen on
its perch Chase regards Yolander as being completely insane

YOLANDER
(menacing)
You want some advice friend You
get in your car you pick up your
family and you get the hell out
of that town

CHASE
Well uh thanks

Chase continues to back out of the door On his way out he bumps
into the stuffed ravens perch

only this raven isnt stuffed It spreads its wings and
SCREECHES

Chase just about jumps out of his skin tripping out of the
doorway

EXT DREWS HOUSE - NIGHT
Gus reaches into the cage and grabs a rabbit by the ears He
casually snaps the neck Laying the limp carcass on a stump
cutting board he quickly skins it

Hanging above the cages there is now a line of furry pelts Half
a dozen

Drew and Geoff are on the porch looking on

DREW
I guess were having rabbit for
dinner

Gus hangs the freshly skinned fur to dry and violently snatches
another hare from the cage

INT DREWS HOUSE - NIGHT

The dinner from Hell Geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes
onto his plate all the while keeping a wary eye on Gus

Gus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit It hits the edge of the
plate teetering on the rim He passes the dish on

Gus meets Geoffs gaze For a moment theres a deadened vacant
look in Gus eyes Then slowly a limp smile creeps over him
sending a chill up Geoffs spine

Geoff averts Gus stare Gus helps himself to potatoes and passes
the plate on He lets go of it short of reaching Drew Only Drews
quick hands save it from hitting the table

Amanda comes to the table with a dish of LIMA BEANS She casts Gus
a cold hateful stare and sets the limas down Shes still angry
over last night

Gus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward Drew Like before
he lets it drop too early This time Drew doesnt save it The
lima beans shower the floor

AMANDA
God damnit Gus This isnt
funny

Amanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess

Geoff and Drew exchange quick glances As Geoff reaches for the
salt

Gus intercepts his wrist Geoff gulps
Gus drops his jaw revealing a gooey mass of food But the frozen
smile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than

playfulness

Geoff and Drew cant believe their eyes They laugh uncomfortably
Theres no other response
Gus LAUGHS too awkward terrible laughter Spitting out food
over his shirt and plate as he does so

The boys stop laughing but Gus just keeps on going
Amanda stares at Gus and carries the mess out of the room
Through his laughter Gus bandage has slipped down exposing part

of his ragged wound The wound glistens oozing CLOTTED BLOOD and
GOOEY PUS

Drew hesitantly reaches for Gus neck readjusting the bandage
Grossed out Geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside
INT DREWS ROOM - LATER

Geoff and Drew enter Drew swiftly secures the deadbolts on his
door

GEOFF
What was that all about You
think hes trying to scare us

DREW
I dont know but Im not taking
any chances

Drew opens the chest at the foot of his bed and produces a
SHOTGUN A box full of shells spill as he withdraws the gun
Cracking open the chamber Drew loads two shells into the chamber

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

A moonlit horizon Unmoving Silent The kind of silence that
pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination

And now A LONE FIGURE appears on the horizon Its Zowie moving
at a deliberate pace

ATOP A KNOLL

Zowie takes pause The TINKLING of his collar tags resumes as he
drops over the horizon line cutting down the hill

INT CHASES HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase sits in the den looking exhausted and disheveled In front
of him the tv is on RENEES FACE stares out at us Chase hits
the remote and rises moving to the back door

He checks the deadbolt then secures the chain link as a backup
From somewhere outside we hear a DOG HOWL

Chases eyes drop to the DOGGY DOOR a holdover from the previous
owner Chase bends down and latches the door
Now he pauses at his desk considers then pulls something out
of the bottom drawer Its a gun

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Chase moves to the front of the house securing that door
Satisfied he turns off the light and heads upstairs

WE STAY AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS -

MOVING INTO DARKNESS shadow and form begin to take shape We hear
a low GROWL and see a flash of RED EYES Its Zowie Already in

INT CHASES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Coming through the door from the downstairs Chase stops cold

RENEE is on the bed Clothed in a negligee Lying across a blanket
of rose petals Her eyes meet his with powerful longing

RENEE
Chase I miss you so much

CHASE
(dry-mouthed)
Renee
Chase approaches Slowly Fearful that this is all a dream

Renee reaches out her hand They touch This is not a dream

CHASE
Oh God

Chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as Renee draws
his body to hers

They kiss Once Twice Not a dream

Renee rolls Chase over forcefully climbing on top Chase sinks
down into the center of the bed as Renee straddles him

Slowly Renee slips off the top of her negligee
RENEE
(a whisper)
I can come back Chase

and sinks down on top of him kissing him hungrily

Her nipples graze his chest then her breasts flatten as she
grinds her hips against his
Almost instantly the weight of her grows unbearable Chase fights
to pull his mouth from hers to breathe

CHASE
No Too heavy

There is no pleasure in his words just unmitigated horror as
Renees body comes down on him harder

CHASE
»-cant breathe I cant

CHASES EYES
pop open frenzied AS HE COMES OUT OF HIS DREAM

Chase is alone on the bed but hes still feeling the weight
pressing down on him

ZOWIE

is laying on his chest staring back at him rearing his teeth in
a growl

Zowie LUNGES forward jaws flashing and Chase twists sideways
GNASHING TEETH connect with Chases shoulder then with the

pillows where Chases head used to be A BLIZZARD OF DOWN FEATHERS
ERUPTS

Chase scrambles out of bed flailing for the gun on the bedside
table

THE GUN spins out of reach and across the floor

Chase DIVES for the gun and reaches it just as Zowie leaps to the
floor In a panic Chase FIRES WILD

Zowie abruptly turns and SMASHES through the bedroom window
sending glass flying

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT

Zowie slides down the room and leaps to the ground below
disappearing into the night

INT CHASES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Chase looks on in terror Finally he pulls his eyes away from the
shattered window

and catches a glimpse of something in the dresser mirror
Something that sends a chill up his spine

The flurry of down feathers is floating to the mattress But
intermingling with the feathers are a handful of ROSE PETALS
slowly settling to the bed
INT BATHROOM - MORNING

Chase is bare-chested at the mirror applying a dressing to the
dog bite on his shoulder

Marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry She
stops short at the sight of Chase standing there in his boxers

Chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled

MARJORIE
I didnt mean to I was going to
empty the hamper

Chase turns shaking off the scare

CHASE
Its okay

Marjories eyes cant help but fix on the dog bites scattered over
Chases chest and arms

MARJORIE
What happened to you

CHASE
I had a little run-in with Zowie

MARJORIE
You sure did

Marjorie sets the laundry aside

MARJORIE
Here let me do that

Marjorie looks over the antiseptics Chase has laid out on the
sink Saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide she gently
cleanses the gashes on his arms

Theres nothing overtly sexual in her actions but the gentleness
of her touch doesnt go unnoticed by Chase

MARJORIE
I hope he doesnt have rabies

CHASE
He doesnt I dont know what he
has but Im hoping to God its
not infectious

Chase stops and looks at Marjories reflection in the mirror
CHASE

Marjorie what do you know about
the Creed murders
Marjorie stiffens for a moment Obviously the Creeds are a sore
spot for the people in this town

MARJORIE

Did you ever play that game where
you pass a story down a row of
people and see how screwed up it

People say Louis Creeds son came
back from the dead and it drove
him crazy

(she rolls her eyes)
He killed his wife and himself
and thats the end of story
Anything else belongs in the
National Enquirer

Marjorie tapes the bandage over Chases shoulder too tight
Chases groan snaps her back to the reality at hand

MARJORIE
Sorry Now tell me what that has
to do with Zowie

Chase closes his eyes shutting out the pain

CHASE
I wish I knew

INT LIBRARY - DAY

Chase approaches the counter looking to the ELDERLY LIBRARIAN for
assistance

LIBRARIAN
What are you looking for Hon

CHASE
Do you have anything on the Creed
murders I cant find the
microfilm from that period

The librarians smile vanishes She lowers her voice focusing her
attention on some paperwork

LIBRARIAN
We dont keep anything on file
from that far back

CHASE
But youve got files from the
previous years

LIBRARIAN
We have nothing on the Creed
murders sir Can I get you
something else

Chase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on
him TOWNSPEOPLE withholding a dark secret

Chase slowly backs away eager to escape the field of hostile
stares

EXT HIGHWAY COUNTRY BRIDGE - DAY

Geoff and Drew have parked their bikes beneath the bridge They
sit on the bank of the creek below watching the water run past
Geoff is lost in thought

GEOFF
Do you think everyone that came

back would be like Gus

DREW

I dont know

(thinking)
-maybe it depends on what you
were like before you

GEOFF
(finishing)
Dies

Drew nods He tosses a stone into the creek then looks up at the
sun and sighs

DREW
I gotta go back and do my
chores
GEOFF
Go later
Drew shakes his head
DREW

I cant Gusd kill me if I
showed up late

The boys reluctantly rise and move to their bikes walking them up
the steep grade to the highway

DREW
See you at school Monday

Geoff nods He looks at Drew The boy is genuinely frightened But
theres nothing either of them can do Theyre trapped in their
roles as kids
Both boys mount their bikes Drew turns

DREW
You ever think about running away

GEOFF
All the time

Drew smiles at this He waves to Geoff and pedals off
DREW
(calling back)
See ya
Geoff waves and heads off in the opposite direction

WE STAY ON DREW -

As he moves down the road Up ahead we hear the approaching WHINE
of a motorcycle

CLYDE

rips by on an old junkyard fixer-up MOTORCYCLE and hes heading
in Geoffs direction

Seeing him Drew brakes and pulls his bike into a U-turn pumping
furiously to catch up with Geoff

ON GEOFF -

Now Geoff hears the WHINE of Clydes motorcycle He glances
back

Clydes spotted him REVVING the engine

Geoff pedals like mad but its no use Clyde is closing in on
him grinning sadistically

Clyde sweeps in next to him calling out over the ENGINE

CLYDE
Well look whos here

Clyde veers right forcing Geoff towards the shoulder of the
road

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The ground ahead drops toward a ravine Geoff has nowhere to go
but down the slope Clyde is right there beside him
Laughing Clyde reaches over and grabs ahold of Geoffs handlebar
He jerks it sideways

CLYDE
Oops

Geoffs front wheel turns perpendicular The bike pitches forward
THROWING Geoff into the dirt ahead

Clyde broadies his bike to a stop With the engine idling he hops
off

Before Geoff can get to his feet Clyde has picked up Geoffs bike
and planted it upside down in the dirt

CLYDE
Guess your Dads not here to save
you now is he

Clyde gets a handful of Geoffs collar and drags him over toward
the bike With his free hand Clyde cranks the pedal

The back wheel spins Faster and faster

CLYDE
You ever seen a tire take off a
nose

Through the blur of the spokes WE SEE Geoff eyes widening
fearfully

CLYDE
Neither have I

Clyde forces Geoffs face toward the spinning tread

CLYDE
Might even kill ya Wheel might
chew right into your brains You
could visit your mom

Geoff tries to get a hold on the frame of the bike for leverage
but his arms dont reach beyond the spinning wheel

Clyde is full of deranged glee fueled by Geoffs fear

But now A HAND grabs the wool scarf streaming from the back of
Clydes neck and yanks him off of Geoff

Clyde reels finding

GUS standing there behind him He looks bad Real bad His
bandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping His
face is unearthly pale Hes deteriorated considerably since

yesterday

CLYDE
(startled)
Jesus Christ Gus

Gus levels a threatening gaze at Geoff

GUS
Go home

But Geoff remains frozen Gus fixes him with a stare that could
turn flesh to stone

GUS
I said GO HOME

Geoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over He gets a running
start making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back

ON THE KNOLL NEARBY

Drew stops short of the ravine watching from afar as Gus steps
toward Clyde

BELOW -

Clyde throws up his hands Hes frightened but he tries to muster
up a cocky front

CLYDE
Come on Gus I was just fucking
with him
(nervous laughter)
Whatre you gonna do Give me a
ticket I mean shit Gus

Clyde grows increasingly wary of Gus evil stare Gus steps
closer

CLYDE
You cant lay a finger on me

Wrong Gus lashes out backhanding Clyde across the face

Clyde falls to the ground flat on his back with his nose gushing
blood Terrified

Gus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle With one hand
under the back of the seat and the other working the accelerator
handlebar Gus advances toward Clyde

Gus kicks the bike into gear and REVS the accelerator

THE REAR WHEEL SPINS On the pavement it would be moving forty
miles an hour

Clyde cant believe his eyes Pleading

CLYDE
Gus what are you doing

GUS
Im just fucking with you

Gus plants his foot against Clydes chest pinning him and lowers
the spinning rear wheel TOWARD CLYDES NECK The wheel WHINES like

a circular saw

Gus lowers the wheel Then jerks it away flashing a sadistic
smile

Just when Clyde thinks Gus is backing off the wheel comes down
again

CLYDE
(wailing)

Stop it man Stop it

Gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning
wheel at the terrified bully

But this time as the wheel comes down

CLYDES WOOL SCARF defying gravity gets swept up swallowed into
the GEARS

And along with the scarf here comes Clydes SCREAMING face We
can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows

BLOOD sprays up over Gus arms and chest And then we hear the
sound of CRUNCHING BONES jamming the motorcycles gears

GUS
(dead-pan)
Whoops
He bares his teeth in a deaths head grin
ON THE KNOLL
Drew has witnessed the killing Hes mortified

BELOW -

Gus tosses the bloody motorcycle aside slowly raising his eyes up
to where Drew stands His eyes meet Drews

Drew hastily jerks his bike around and takes off
Gus starts after him on foot

Drew rushes through the front door SLAMMING it behind him and
throwing the deadbolt
INT BEDROOM - DAY

Drew climbs onto his bed and grabs his shotgun from the gun rack
His fingers shake as he flips off the safety

DREW
Oh man

Just then we hear the CRACKLE of a POLICE PA and Gus amplified
VOICE coming from the yard outside

GUS (VO)
(mocking)
This is the Police come out of
the house with your hands up

Gus finishes his words with a burst of FEEDBACK and then amplified
MANIACAL LAUGHTER

Drews eyes go wide with terror He creeps out into the hall
clutching the gun

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Drew tries to look out the window Then we hear a low guttural
GROWL Drew slowly turns

Zowie is standing down the hall leveling a dead stare Zowie
takes the first step forward

DREW
(horrified)
No Zowie Its me
Pleading Drew slowly retreats down the hallway
Along the way he backs right into
GUS grinning from ear to ear

Drew recoils against the wall swinging up his shotgun

DREW
Stay back

But Gus just keeps on grinning He takes a step forward
Drew pulls the trigger
And CLICK Nothing happens The chambers are empty

GUS
Forget something Drew buddy

Gus raises his hand Hes holding the shotgun shells He lets them
fall to the floor
Suddenly Gus wrenches the gun from Drews hands He swings it
and

Drew SCREAMS and ducks beneath the blow as the shotgun butt
SMASHES a hole in the wall above his head Gus flings the shotgun
aside and LUNGES for Drew

Drew races down the hallway to the back door He turns the latch
The deadbolt has been locked from the inside

Drews eyes whip to the keyholder on the wall All the keyhooks
are empty

Here comes the JINGLING of keys in Gus pockets as he comes down
the hall

Drew dashes away from the back door

Gus eyes shift from Drews fleeing form to A BOX OF TOOLS in the
service closet

AT THE FRONT DOOR

Drew jimmies the knob Again the deadbolt is locked from the
inside Tears are streaming down Drews face now

FOOTSTEPS approach Drew spins around
Gus is advancing WITH A HAMMER tight in his grip

GUS
(crazed)
You have the right to remain
silent

WHAM Gus SMASHES the hammer into the wall to punctuate his words
Plaster goes flying

GUS
(continuing)
while I bash your fucking head
in

Drews eyes dart frantically looking for a way out The closest
route of escape is UP THE STAIRS

Down the hallway Zowie starts running forward Drews caught
between a rock and a hard place

GUS
You have the right to a lawyer
but you wont need one

He runs for it Gus charges to intercept him

Drew gets to the stairs first
GUS
cause youll be dead

WHAM Gus brings the hammer down with the claw end leading It
sinks into the stair below Drews feet

Zowie LEAPS past Gus tearing up the stairs as Gus wrenches the
hammer free

UPSTAIRS

Drew makes it to the top of the stairs with Zowie right on his
heels

Drew DIVES into Amanda and Gus bedroom as

Zowie springs from the floor Drew SLAMS the door shut SMACKING
Zowie Zowie collapses to the floor dazed

Drew throws the latch on the door Almost immediately Gus is
outside POUNDING at the door with the claw end of the hammer

Wood splinters fly as the hammer claw sinks through

Drew SCREAMS and goes for one of the dormer windows Its stuck

From the hallway Gus violently SMASHES the door again and again
The door is splintering apart WE SEE glimpses of Gus through the
ragged holes
GUS (0S)
Do you understand these rights
Drew buddy
Drew grabs a chair and HEAVES it through the window

takes it to the ground with him

Untangling himself he gets to his feet

path so shell go no further She SLAMS on the brakes
Drew pulls open the passenger door and dives inside
DREW

Just then the BACK DOOR flies open Gus steps out
GUS

Amanda spots the hammer hanging from his grip Gus cracks a sick
smile and FLINGS THE HAMMER at the car

spiderweb

Clearly there are no survivors

feeling utterly helpless

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Chase pushes open the door A spring coil pulls the CREAKING door
closed behind him One look at the attic and Chase turns pale

A huge window at the far end of the room allows the moonlight to
reach all corners of the spacious old attic

All of Renees belongings have been unpacked The entire attic has
been converted into a museum-like room down to the last
meticulous detail A room in preparation for Renees return

Gauzy curtains billow out from some unseen draft Pictures of
Renee rest everywhere Awards Memorabilia

GEOFF is seated before the brightly lit three-way theatrical
mirror casually setting out Renees make-up

CHASE
Geoff what are you doing

Theres an obsessive dementia in Geoffs gaze

GEOFF
Im getting things ready for Mom

Chase sighs Obviously the strain of Drews funeral has proven too
much for Geoff He moves closer

CHASE
(gently)
Mom is dead Geoff You know

A creepy smile flickers across Geoffs face

GEOFF
She doesnt have to be
Chase freezes as a chill runs up his spine

CHASE

GEOFF
I can bring her back The same
way Drew and me brought Zowie

The grave is a gaping cavity The casket has been unearthed

He stuck around after the funeral
Told me he had an order to exhume
your wife I didnt think much of
it until I saw him drag the body
out of the coffin
(shakes his head)

He put your wife in his truck and
drove off right through Amanda and
Drews headstones

The caretaker points across the hillside
TIRE TRACKS cut through the manicured grass cutting a path of
destruction right through the field of headstones and on through
the fence

Recovering from the scare Chase reaches over and opens the glove
compartment He pulls out his gun and sets it on the seat next to
him

EXT MICMAC BURIAL GROUND

Geoff climbs the stone steps reaching the flattop meas He stops
short looking over the clearing

GUS

is standing in the center of the burial ground Hes HUMMING
mimicking Renees feminine tone Now he stops and slowly turns
regarding Geoff with dead eyes Hes holding a pickaxe and shovel
at his side

Gus looks to the ground at his side Geoff follows his gaze
A VISION OF RENEES GRAVE APPEARS -
Headstone Manicured grass Thriving flowers As if it had been

uprooted from her resting place at Pleasantville and set down
right in the middle of the Micmac ground
And now the vision of Renees grave fades away In its place is a
bundle of white RENEES SHROUDED BODY

Gus raises the pickaxe offering it to Geoff

Marjorie cautiously pushes open the door Her concern for Geoff is
forgotten as she beholds the Renee Hallow memorabilia

She moves about Renees unpacked belongings in bewildered
reverence

The gauzy curtains billow about Marjorie like ghosts And then she
glimpses something beyond the curtains

A FIGURE

stands in the shadows wearing the BEADED PEACH DRESS that
Marjorie had admired earlier For a moment we think its Renee
but as Marjorie draws closer we see that the dress has been
fitted onto a dressmakers model

Marjorie lays a hand on the fabric feeling the contours of the
design

swings it around FIRES

thats been cut in the base of the front door

headlights

INT GUS HOUSE - NIGHT

Chases headlights stream through the windows distorting the
interior The house looks like its been through a tornado A
trail of BLOODY PAW PRINTS leads into the kitchen The stench is

repulsive Grimacing Chase has to keep himself from gagging

CHASE
Jesus

As Chase moves forward he catches sight of

GUS

standing in a swath of light At Gus feet is Zowie tongue
lolling out of his mouth Dead for the second time Scattered

around the dog are various tools

Propped against the wall is the cut out square of wood Its
fitted with hinges at the top

CHASE
Gus what are you doing

Gus glances down at the dead dog
GUS
(dead-pan)
I was building a doggy door

CHASE
God damn it Gus you dug up my
wife What the fuck is going on
around here

Gus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side pointing it
at Chase in a threatening manner

Gus
(grins)
A little drilling A little
killing

As Gus moves forward Chase gets a good look at him for the first
time He doesnt look even remotely alive

CHASE
Holy shit

Chase levels his gun with a trembling hand
Gus stabs the air with the drill feeding on Chases horror

Chase pulls the trigger A bullet pounds Gus chest A SPRAY OF
FLESH explodes from his back

Unphased Gus regains his balance

Gus
God I hate when that happens

Before Chase can squeeze off the next round Gus rips the gun from
his grip

GUS
You got a permit for that

Opening the chamber Gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses
the gun aside

GUS
Didnt think so

Gus fires up the drill The bit spinZZZZZZ He DIVES at Chase
knocking him back against the counter The drill bit SINKS INTO
CHASES ARM

Chase SCREAMS as Gus withdraws it Now he presses it into Chases
shoulder Chase is on the verge of blacking out now The pain is

unbearable

Gus withdraws the drill once again aiming now for Chases eye
Gus
(maniacal)
No brain no pain Chase Think
about it

The whirling drill bit is millimeters away from Chases eye He
clutches Gus arm trying to force the drill aside

At the last second adrenaline kicks in and Chase diverts the
drill It SINKS INTO the counter-top nearby STUCK

Gus ROARS lashing out but Chase manages to duck away

Chase catches sight of HIS GUN on the floor He scrambles for it
scooping it up

BULLETS are rolling across the floor every which way Chase slaps
his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber

Gus hands CLAMP DOWN around Chases neck He swings Chase around
and SLAMS him against the wall lifting him off his feet

Chase GASPS as the life is literally crushed out of him

He brings the gun up beneath Gus chin and jams it into his ruined
throat Gus just keeps on throttling him

Gus
(insane)
Just remember Chase I had Renee
first and now Im gonna have her

last

the incredible force tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a
HEAVY THUD

entranced Shes wearing the beaded peach dress

With the help of Renees vast array of cosmetics Marjorie has
turned herself into a stunning beauty
The lipstick isnt quite right Turning to the countertop
magnifying mirror she carefully touches up her ruby red lips Her
face fills nearly the entire mirror

except for one rim which reflects the dark shadowy attic
behind her

A HUGE EYE joins her reflection in the distorting mirror Marjorie
nearly jumps out of her skin She spins around

MARJORIE
Jesus Geoff Dont sneak up on
me like that

but no one is there

THE MAKE-UP MIRROR catches another glimpse Renees RED LIPS
magnified tenfold The lips begin to move

RENEE

Did you really think you could be
like me

Renees fist swings in SMASHING a panel of the mirror

Marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying
glass And as her hands come down she finds

Renee standing before her Her ghostly form silhouetted by
moonlight Curtains billowing around her We never fully see her

Marjories face goes white with fear
RENEE
Such a young face but youve got

potential

Renee grabs a fistful of Marjories hair viciously YANKING her
head back

Well do the eyes first You

always start with the eyes

Marjories right eye Marjorie SCREAMS

Chase turns his head away And thats when he sees them
RENEE AND GEOFF

Holding each other tightly Geoff has his head buried in Renees
breast Renee looks up from her son meeting Chases gaze Her
voice is both seductive and terrifying

RENEE
Hello Chase

Chase gasps The word horror doesnt do the moment justice

CHASE
Oh my God

RENEE
We can try again Chase We can
make it work this time

Chase sinks back against the wall Hes lost a lot of blood and
his strength is leaving him

CHASE

No

RENEE

CHASE

But Geoff just holds his mother tighter A hint of annoyance
flickers through Renees eyes She strokes Geoffs hair

RENEE

Geoff honey why dont you go
downstairs Your father and I
need a moment alone Do it for
me

Geoff looks up at his mother mesmerized She releases him from
the embrace He brushes past Chase without a glance and heads for
the attic door

Geoff pauses at the door looking back Renees words have a
hauntingly familiar ring

RENEE
I love you

Geoff smiles Turning away he opens the door and
CLYDE

torn to shit bones and brain matter exposed Hes covered from
head to toe in dirt and clotted blood He looks worse than any of
the undead weve seen A total walking nightmare

Geoff

Chase stumbles forward to rescue his son As he does so Clyde

brings the axe back up SMASHING Chase in the head with the blunt
end

Chase goes down Unconscious

CLYDE
Oops Looks like Daddy got a boo-
boo

Clyde turns his gaze back on Geoff

CLYDE
Now where were we

Geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as Clyde moves into the
room

Renee passes behind Clyde She SLAMS the attic door shut and snaps
off the knob with a jerk of the wrist locking them all inside

Scared out of his wits Geoff makes it to his feet Clyde swings
again and misses

Geoff grabs hold of the axe handle struggling and the two boys
go down

RENEE

Moves to the vanity She sweeps a hand across it sending
everything crashing to the ground Crystal perfume bottles
SHATTER spilling their contents over the floor
Renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on She touches the
flame to the perfume-soaked floor

FLAMES roar into existence racing across the floorboards
igniting the curtains

We see the flames reflected in Renees soulless eyes
ON GEOFF AND CLYDE

As they wrestle with one another across the floor Bloody spittle
drips from Clydes face He flashes a feral snarl

Clyde LUNGES forward and tears into Geoffs shoulder with his
teeth

Geoff SCREAMS His hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on
mirror shard He JABS it up and into Clydes eye

Somehow Geoff manages to roll out from under Clyde He rises to
his feet

Clyde lets loose a DEMONIC ROAR He charges SLASHING the axe
wildly knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike
Nothings going to stop him Nothing

Flames are consuming the attic licking the rafters igniting the
canopy drapings devouring everything SMOKE is rolling across
the floor

Geoff reaches a far wall Hes trapped in a corner Theres
nowhere else to go Behind Geoff is a CIRCUIT BOX INSULATED
CABLES run from the box down through the attic floor Geoff
turns

And here comes Clyde

CLYDE
Here it comes buddy HERE IT
FUCKING COMES

Clyde swings Geoff ducks The axe hits the circuit box behind
him severing the insulated cables

As Clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try Geoff
reaches for one of the SPARKING CABLES

Clyde raises the axe above his head

CLYDE
Eat it ass-hole

GEOFF
EAT THIS

and Geoff shoves the live cable into Clydes mouth
SPARKS shoot out of Clydes eyes and ears He jerks back and
forth writhing in a horrific replay of Renees electrocution

Then Clydes face BLOWS APART in a gout of ruined flesh and BLUE
FLAME The circuit is blown and the SMOKING BODY falls

Geoff drops the cable The blazing inferno is closing in He runs
to Chase

Chase is barely conscious Geoff drops to his knees and pulls his
father to his feet

RENEE (0S)
Dont leave me again Geoff

Geoff turns

RENEE

is standing in the midst of the FLAMES reaching out The make-up
and morticians wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her

face begins to MELT AWAY

RENEE
Dont leave me alone

Geoff turns away horrified With Chase on his shoulder he
reaches the door Locked Geoff sets Chase against the wall

He spots the AXE still clutched in Clydes hand Geoff drags the
axe free from the dead boys grasp and goes to work on the door

Ignoring Renees CRIES Geoff swings the axe again and again
chopping the door apart He coughs through the smoke The flames
are almost upon them

Finally the wood splinters apart Geoff reaches through and
grasps the outside handle pulling the door open Then he turns

and lifts Chase up once more

At the door Geoff pauses for one final tearful look back Then
his face hardens and he turns away pulling Chase to safety

RENEE
NO GEOFF NO

ON RENEE

Alone in the fiery storm SCREAMING Flames devour her flowing
white dress Her face doesnt even look remotely human anymore

And as the inferno slowly closes in we
DISSOLVE

EXT VETERINARY OFFICE - DAY

TO
We PULL OUT from a sign on the door that says CLOSED

Chase is just now locking up the door Hes bandaged up looking a
little worse for the wear but happy to be alive He turns
grinning

GEOFF

stands near the van holding Tiger in his arms

GEOFF
All set

CHASE
All set

Chase joins Geoff at the van and together they climb inside Chase
starts the engine pulling away from the office

WE STAY ON THE VAN -

As it moves off down the street passing the familiar landmarks of
sleepy Ludlow

RISING UP -

We follow the van as it sweeps out of town Ludlow looks picture-
perfect from our birds eye vantage point Charming and quiet

CHASE (VO)
So wherere we going

GEOFF
Anywhere but here

We continue rising up into the brilliant blue sky losing the van
amidst the rolling Maine countryside and we

DISSOLVE TO
EXT MICMAC FOREST - DAY
RUSHING over the woods just above the tree tops Its an ocean of
swaying green beneath us A forest as ancient and mysterious as
anything on the Earth

AND SUDDENLY -

The endless trees fall out from under us We find ourselves above
the flattop mesa of the Micmac burial ground swooping downward

The ground surges towards us We see Renees OPEN GRAVE
The quality of light is different now We hear the wail of the

LONESOME WIND and perhaps the WHISPER of something altogether
alien
And on the unsettling note we

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
