INT ST MONICAS CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING

A MONSTROUS GARGOYLE Sculpted in stone A WARRIOR ANGEL In
stained glass CHRIST ON A CROSS Carved in wood

And thats FATHER PEREZ -- late 40s of flesh and bone --
standing at the pulpit --

FATHER PEREZ
God honors sacrifice And our
sacrifices touch Gods heart and
move his hand This is my
commandment that you love one another
as I have loved you

And while you will no doubt throw this up ON SCREEN
LOS ANGELES 1970

You could already tell that by the hairstyles and wardrobe
of the congregation Among them are --

MIA and JOHN FORM 20s Holding hands Seem to be enjoying
the sermon But as the camera pans down we see theyre
actually engaged in --
An intense thumb war battle
PEREZ

Greater love has no one than

this that someone lay down his life

for his loved ones

Mia almost has him but John -- sneak attack -- extends his
pointer finger and pins her down --

PEREZ (CONTD)

One two
MOMENTS LATER

Organ BLARES Congregation rises A murmur of conversation
John and Mia walk down the aisle Out in the

NARTHEX

Theyre greeted by PETE HIGGINS early 50s He was the man
seated next to them in the pew

PETE
Who won
MIA
John But he cheats

John squeezes Mia His hand over the small bump of her belly
JOHN
It was two against one I had to do
something

Mia blushes Embarrassed

Pete smiles but looks past them at the congregation still
leaving the church

PETE

Mia moves Johns hand away

MIA

INT CHURCH - SIDE ALTAR - MOMENTS LATER
THE VIRGIN MARY looks down at --

SHARON HIGGINS late 40s Looks older She kneels at the
side altar Lights a votive candle Prays

BEHIND HER

Mia walks in searching Stops when she sees Sharon Watches
her for a bit too long because ---

Sharon turns getting to her feet

Mia not sure whether to stay or leave Doesnt matter anyway
because --

SHARON

day he thinks Ill just
She takes Mias hand Nevermind
SHARON (CONTD)

INTEXT CONTINENTAL - HIGGINS HOUSE - LATER

A Lincoln Continental pulls into the driveway Parks As the
Higgins and the Forms exit the car --
JOHN
We appreciate the lift Pete

SHARON

this wife and baby of yours

John and Mia smile

SHARON (CONTD)

SHARON

SHARON
Oh dear
MIA

JOHN
Shes right Everyone hates her

Pete laughs
PETE
Cmon Sharon Lets get inside
Sounds like these two have a lot to
talk about

MIA
Thank you again

SHARON
Think nothing of it And remember
children are a blessing

PETE

They are indeed Then they learn to
talk

EXT FORM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Hand in hand John and Mia walk next door and up the path
toward their front porch

JOHN
So thats a no on Gertrude

Mia looks back at the Pete and Sharon entering their home

MIA
You shouldnt talk so much about the
baby in front of them Its it
isnt right

JOHN

What Why not

MIA
They only lost their daughter two
years ago

JOHN
They didnt lose their daughter
Mia She ran away and joined up with
the hippies By now she probably has
three husbands and calls herself
Star

MIA
Well even Star is a better name
than Gertrude

John turns the knob and opens the Front Door

MIA (CONTD)
You didnt lock it
JOHN
Why would I

As she enters --
MIA
We need to start locking it Its a

TchnkTchnkTchnkTchnk

Mia sits in front of her SINGER SEWING MACHINE Threading a
green piece of fabric

Her fingers move precariously close to the needle as it goes
up and down and up and down a million times a second

JOHN (0S)
Honey can you shut the TV off Its
making it a little hard to
concentrate

Mia gets up

Gathers up the fabric at the sewing machine

Switches off the television

Goes into the

KITCHEN

Where John sits at the table

Drowning in MEDICAL BOOKS open to various chapters We catch
glimpses of Cadavers skeletons gross anatomy

Mia rubs his neck
JOHN (CONTD)
You shouldnt be watching that stuff
anyway You could upset the baby
Theres been some new research

MIA
Oh Gosh More new research

JOHN
Its true Theyre learning that
babies in utero experience much more
of the outside world than they ever
thought possible They recognize
voices noises songs

MIA
I bet the men who did that research
spent millions when they could have
just asked a mother for free

She sits on his lap Flips through his books

MIA
Hows it going in here anyway

JOHN
Im trying my hardest to enjoy it
Everyone keeps reminding me that
when youre in your residency it
gets a million times worse I dont
even mention the fact Ill also be a
new father

MIA
Why not

JOHN
I dont know Sometimes you just
dont want to hear it

MIA
Hear what

JOHN
How difficult things can be

MIA
Difficult

JOHN
Maybe difficult isnt the word
Challenging
MIA
Are you talking about the residency
or me and the baby

JOHN
I dont know All of it I guess

Mia gets up from his lap
Uh-oh

JOHN (CONTD)
What

INT NURSERY - MOMENTS LATER

Some people choose animals as a theme Others choose the
moon and stars Mia clearly chose --

DOLLS

Of all sorts Like shes been collecting them for awhile

the rocking chair On the shelves In the crib
Mia folds the fabric drapes it over the chair
John appears in the doorway Apologetic

JOHN (CONTD)
Look I didnt mean for that to sound
like it did Im sorry

MIA
Howd you want it to sound

JOHN
Not like that But its not as if
difficult or challenging are bad
things anyway Look at what you put
me through before you said yes to
our first date

MIA
But wasnt it worth it

JOHN
I still cant believe it worked

Mia sighs

JOHN (CONTD)
But I am sorry Mia I know sometimes
I can get a little caught up in my
own world

On
MIA
Its fine I know youre stressed
Ive just been a little sensitive
lately

JOHN
Okay well Want me to tell you why

MIA
Oh please Doctor

JOHN
Well in my almost expert opinion
youre a little sensitive because
youre a lot pregnant

Mia laughs

JOHN (CONTD)
I really am sorry Mia Yes Im
stressed over finishing med school
Yes Im freaking out over being
matched but Ive never been happier
And thats because of you

He kisses her

JOHN (CONTD)
Here Wait I want to give you

something

MIA
Last time you said that I ended up
pregnant

John exits the nursery
Leaves Mia alone

She touches the mobile above the crib It plays a few notes
of Rockabye Baby She smiles

Maybe thinking of the wonderful things yet to come
John returns

A LARGE WRAPPED GIFT in his hands I bet you know what this
is But Mia doesnt So lets watch

JOHN
I was saving this until baby but

MIA
But now youre feeling --
JOHN
-- guilty About what I said Yes

SECONDS LATER
Mia tears at the wrapping revealing --

Those eyes Those pig tails That smile We know her as the
ANNABELLE DOLL But weve never seen her like this

New Perfect Exquisite

MIA
Oh my god John

JOHN
Thats the one right

Mia nods Its the one

MIA
I love her

She puts Annabelle down and kisses John He wraps Mia up in
his arms Holds her as he looks around the nursery

JOHN
You really did a fine job in here

MIA
Thanks
JOHN
One question though
(pause)

What if its a boy
INT MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
Mia and John Asleep in bed
A cool breeze blows through the open bedroom window

And the CLOSED COTTON CURTAINS billow out almost like theyre
floating under water revealing between them --

The HIGGINS HOUSE

Next door

A light goes on as --

The curtains fall back into place

But then --

Another breeze lifts them again and WE SEE --

Pete is out of bed Like he just heard something in the next
room Sharon sits up in bed

Curtains fall

Breeze

Sharon says something to Pete
Cant hear what

But both seem concerned which is when Pete leaves the bedroom
to investigate and -- shit --

Curtains

A SCREAM

Breeze

BLOOD on the walls in the Higgins Bedroom

Someone enters back into the room -- FUCK -- cant get a
good look cause --

Curtains

Right as Mia sits up in bed

She goes over to the window and pulls Curtains aside to reveal --
Higgins Bedroom is dark

Lights out

MIA
John -- John -- wake up --

JOHN
Wassat Is it the baby

MIA
No -- next door -- I heard a scream --
I think something is wrong

John joins her at the window No evidence of what we just
witnessed So dont blame him too much when he says --

JOHN
Stay here Ill go check it out

MIA
John -- wait --

She follows him down the
HALLWAY

MIA (CONTD)
Shouldnt we call the cops

John pauses at the FRONT DOOR
Hand on the knob
JOHN
Because you think you heard a scream
Let me just go over and see Theyd

do the same for us

I dont know about you but Im getting the sense that
something is standing on the other side of that door

Something bad
MIA
If they heard me scream Id rather
they call the police for us
JOHN
Think they heard you scream you
mean
He starts to turn the doorknob
No
Dont do that

MIA
Just be careful

JOHN
I will

He pulls open the Front Door to reveal -- gasp --
Oh

My sense was wrong Its nothing

He exits

Mia watches him from the

FRONT DOOR

As he crosses over their yard and into the

HIGGINS
Loses sight of him when he steps onto their front porch
She waits

Along with the crickets And that DOG BARKING somewhere down
at the end of their block

Waits some more

Anxious she steps outside and --

EXT FORM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

-- takes a half step down off the porch

MIA
-John

No answer

She leaves the stairs

Walks over to the

HIGGINS HOUSE

Eyes fixated on the darkness of their Front Porch
As she approaches

Petrified

MIA (CONTD)
John Where are you Is everything --

WHAM

Front Door flies wide open
Mia reels back

Realizes its John

And hes SPLATTERED in blood Like he just got out of a
botched surgery

JOHN
GO Call an ambulance

MIA
Oh God -- shit -- what happened

BEHIND JOHN

The dim light from the outdoors illuminates Pete and Sharon
Higgins on the floor Drowning in their own blood

Mias mouth moves No words come out Her eyes move back up
to John realizes hes saying --

JOHN
Mia Go Now

John races back inside to help the Higgins’

Mia runs back to their house and hurries up the front steps
and crashes through their front door

INT FORM HOUSE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER
Mia picks the phone off the wall
Dials

Which isnt so easy when youre fingers are shaking like
hers As the line RINGS Mia turns toward the

WINDOW
Watches the Higgins House
Still dark

On the other end of the line Operator answers

MIA
Y-yes -- we need an ambulance -- 473
Garner Road -- two people -- I dont

know -- but theres a lot of blood
IN THE HALLWAY
A STREAK OF WHITE passes behind Mia
Didja see it
Because she didnt

MIA (CONTD)
Yes -- thank you -- please hurry

Mia hangs up
Goes over to the window
Shuts and locks it

Retreats back into the

HALLWAY
And walks toward the Master Bedroom

She passes the Nursery But too distracted to see standing
in the center of the room --

A WOMAN

Bone thin Bald head Loose white clothes stained with red
blood And shes staring down at the --

Annabelle Doll

That she holds in her sharp fingered hands
Holy shit

Mia reaches the

MASTER BEDROOM

And grabs her robe

Throws it on

Cinches the sash as it dawns on her --

Did she just see

Oh God

WOMAN (0S)
I like your dolls

Mia SCREAMS in fear

As a MAN -- thin long beard patches of hair -- steps out
from behind the closet door

In his hand a SHARP KNIFE Sticky with blood
Rushes toward Mia

Grabs her

Raises his knife up high and then --

THNK

Stabs her in the side of the stomach

MIA
NO

Now she SCREAMS in pain
John BURSTS through the bedroom door
Tackles the Man
Knife falls
Skids across the floor
Mia collapses
Blood soaks her nightgown
She looks over at --

John and the Man wrestling on the floor John pins the Man
down with his knees and --

POUNDS-POUNDS-POUNDS his face in with his fists when --

The Woman -- YELLING LIKE A BANSHEE -- enters and LEAPS onto
Johns BACK Sinks her teeth in his shoulder A rabid dog

That wont let go

Mia crawls over to the knife
Picks it up

Holding her stomach she stands

Sees the Man sit up His eyes wild Nose bashed in But a
smile on thin lips Like hes enjoying this

The Man grabs hold of Johns leg

Twists it

Mia runs over

Falls on top of the Man while she STABS him
The Woman releases her bite on John

Hops on top of Mia

Yanks the knife away from her

Raises it to finish Mia off

But John THROWS her back into the Hallway as --

POLICE charge through the Front Door

Guns at the ready
The Woman scrambles to her feet and dives into the Nursery
Slams the door closed
Locks it
John kneels beside Mia
She writhes on the floor So much pain
EMTS enter into the room
JOHN

Shes pregnant -- five months -- the

baby -- we cant lose the baby --
Mias VISION
In and out of focus as she looks down the
HALLWAY
Police Officers outside the Nursery
BANGING on its locked door

OFFICER
OPEN UP THIS IS THE POLICE

Nope

One Officer raises his gun

Nods to Another

Another approaches the door and --

KICKS it open

Revealing --

The Woman

Seated on the floor against the back wall

Her throat slit wide open By that knife beside her on the
floor And in her hands she clutches close to her chest --

The Annabelle Doll

From the gash in the Womans neck a DROP OF BLOOD rolls
down and onto the Annabelle doll where

It slides down to her eye
Like a crimson tear in reverse
Until it disappears inside the corner of the eye
ON MIA
Getting a glimpse of the horror as shes wheeled by on a
gurney Oxygen mask over her face Hands over belly And
John next to her promising that --
JOHN
Youre okay baby just breathe
youll be okay
Man such optimism
If he only knew
CUT TO
BLACK
Movement within
A WHITE GHOST-LIKE APPARITION
Somewhere a HEARTBEAT Off in the distance
But getting louder And stronger Go on ZOOM OUT to reveal --
An ULTRASOUND
CUT TO
INT DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY

Mia sits in the examination chair John holds her hand seated
on a stool next to it

DOCTOR BURGHER sits across from them

BURGHER
and while the amniotic sac was
not punctured and is not ruptured
we are seeing signs of stress on the
cervix most likely caused by the
trauma which is why were putting
you on bed rest for the remainder of
your pregnancy You can get up to
use the facilities if you do so
delicately but anything beyond that
is putting yourself and your child
at risk

Mia stares back blankly at the doctor Not so sure she hears
him Not so sure she hears anything

Just her own thoughts Her own fears
EXT FORM HOUSE - DAY

Mia leans on John as he helps her up the porch steps Keeps
her hands on her belly Winces with every inch forward

JOHN
Maybe we should take a break

MIA
Im fine

Casts a look over to the Higgins’

MIA (CONTD)
--I just want to get inside

INT FORM HOUSE - VARIOUS - DAY

John helps Mia down the hallway Both step like theyre
walking on a mine field Mia stop --

MIA
Wait wait

-- when she reaches the Nursery She looks inside Everything
is back to normal Like nothing ever happened

JOHN
I had them scrub everything at least
twice You could perform surgery in
there its so clean
Mia reaches in and shuts the door
MIA
I want everything out of the nursery
I cant go in there again
Moves on
INT MASTER BEDROOM - LATER
Mia settles into bed

She looks over at the closet door the Man hid behind Down
at the floor where John was attacked Everywhere a reminder

Protective she pulls the sheets up over her belly

John rolls their ZENITH TV into the bedroom
Plugs it in

MIA
You dont have to do that

JOHN
Mi Youre on bed rest for the next
three months Youd go crazy if I
didnt Just dont get obsessed with
those daytime soaps

MIA
Gosh you know I hate those

John sits down on the edge of the bed Like right on the
edge Doesnt want to rock the bed too much

JOHN
Ill bring your sewing machine in

your factory

Mia grabs his hand Like its anchor

MIA
You really think baby is okay
JOHN
The baby isnt even aware of what
happened
MIA

Oh really Because I heard there
was some new research

JOHN
Mia You heard the doctors So as
long as you listen to them the baby
will be fine The baby is fine Youre
its mother right If it wasnt

Mia looks down at her tummy
Glances over at the window Sees the Higgins next door
MIA
Do you mind shutting those curtains
I want to try and get some rest

John kisses her

JOHN
Good idea

INT FORM HOUSE - VARIOUS - NIGHT

So quiet The only sound is the tickticktick of the clock on
the mantle But you need to strain to even hear that

Furniture sit like slumbering creatures The Sewing Machine
among them an strange alien silhouette

Somewhere a grating creeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaak
Like plastic rubbing against plastic
In the NURSERY

The Mobile above spins Only like a quarter rotation But
enough to get a few notes of ‘Rockabye Baby

In the MASTER BEDROOM

Mia stirs John snores

The quiet resumes

Until --
TehnkTchnkTchnkTchnkTchnkTchnkTchnkTchnkTchnk
Mia starts awake

John springs out of bed

Races down the Hallway and into the

LIVING ROOM

Switches on the lights

Sees the Sewing Machine needle going at top speed Whole
machine shakes and vibrates with motion

John pulls the plug

MIA
John

JOHN
Its okay Its just the sewing
machine

He takes a quick tour of the house

Notes that the Nursery Door is now wide open Reaches in and
begins to close it But the door catches on something

He looks down and sees --

Annabelle

John bends over and picks her up Sets her down on the rocking
chair inside the Nursery

Shuts the door
INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

ON TV

That bitch Erica Kane is spilling the beans that Tyler is

SNOW Static

Frustrated Mia picks up a LIFE Magazine and tosses it against
the TV It shuts off

She turns over on her side Maybe ready to finally get some
rest when she sees --

The Annabelle Doll

Laying on the floor down at the far end of the Hallway Head
turned Staring right at her

MIA
John Could you

She looks over at the clock Its mid-afternoon Ugh

MIA (CONTD)

Shuffles over to the bedroom door

Gives one last look to Annabelle laying there and --
Closes the door

MIA (CONTD)

INT BATHROOM - LATER

Mia peels off the bandage on her belly Examines the stab
wound Youll wince when you see it

Takes a wet cloth and blots around it Her face scrunched
into the oh shit this hurt and looks disgusting expression

She tosses the cloth aside

Washes her hands

Dries em off and exits back into the

As he enters into the bedroom --

JOHN

weeks

MIA

INT ST MONICAS CATHOLIC CHURCH - MORNING

Father Perez is back behind the pulpit He looks like he
should be wearing a badge not a clerical collar

Right now hes saying --
FATHER PEREZ
-we cannot let fear control us
For we are never truly alone when we
walk with God How many times are we
afraid because we do not understand
Isnt it true that the more we know
of something the less power it holds
over us and the less fear we have
for it
John Mia and Leah sit in a pew toward the back
John takes Mias hand
He taps her thumb with his like --
Wanna play

Mia smiles Leans in and whispers --

MIA
I should change her

She gets up with Leah

At the pulpit Perez glances at Mia and Leah as they leave
through the side exit Continues his sermon

EXT ST MONICAS - CHURCHYARD - LATER

Mia sits and plays with Leah on a nearby bench As the
congregation behind her exits onto the street

She watches out for her husband as Father Perez approaches
with a KODAK CAMERA slung around his neck

FATHER PEREZ

to post photos of the newest members
of the congregation

MIA
Yeah of course

As he positions the camera --
FATHER PEREZ
Could you pick her up hold her on

your lap

MIA

Oh -- you dont need me in the photo --

FATHER PEREZ
Of course I do Mothers are closer
to God than any other creature For
only a mother can share in Gods
creative miracle

Mia holds Leah on her lap She forces a smile
He SNAPS a photo

FATHER PEREZ (CONTD)

Its what my parents did when they
hit a rough patch and it worked
for them

FATHER PEREZ
Yes of course I understand But
you two hit more than a rough patch

John and Mia exchange look

FATHER PEREZ (CONTD)
In a matter of months you have
experienced the very worst of life
and the very best A pendulum swing
like that is enough to shake even
the strongest foundations But you
survived And instead of trying to
forget the bad history you should
use it as an example of how strong
you two are when united And you
dont come out the other side of
something like that weaker You
come out stronger And after slaying
the monsters you have what is there
left to be scared of

DET CLARKIN (CONTD)
So I brought what I have on the
Higgins case

He pulls out a FILE and OPENS IT Takes out a PHOTOGRAPH and
shows it to Mia --

Its of the Higgins Daughter from a few years back She
looks like the typical California girl

DET CLARKIN (CONTD)
Thats the Higgins girl -- Annabelle
Looks a little different than last
you saw her This was taken before
she got caught up in that cult

Mia studies the photo Sets it aside
MIA
Did you ever do any more research

into the cult

DET CLARKIN

Research

MIA
Like -- I dont know -- did they
have some sort of motive for their
attacks

DET CLARKIN
Crazy people do --

MIA
-- crazy things I know But they
didnt think they were crazy They

had to have a reason

DET CLARKIN
Well after a little digging I did
find out that their act wasnt
devotional They were actually trying
to conjure something up

MIA
What

DET CLARKIN
Devils demons the tooth fairy
I couldnt tell you specifically

MIA
Did this cult have a name

Clarkin scans his report
DET CLARKIN
Here it is They called themselves
Order of the Ram
EXT USED BOOKSTORE - DAY
Mia pushes the stroller inside

INT USED BOOKSTORE - LATER

Mia walks down an aisle Scans titles that all have to do
with the same topic --

THE OCCULT

She pulls several off the shelf Leafs through pages Words
and phrases jump out at us like --

DEMONS DESIRE SOULS FEED ON FEAR OCCULT RITUALS
Pictures too
Satan Pentagrams Fallen Angels in Hellfire Black cats

VOICE (0S)
You look a little lost

MINUTES LATER

Mia sits at a table in the back Books scattered between her
and CARL 60s Owner of the bookstore

He flips through the pages of a book

Searching

CARL
The Order of the Ram -- based on
what you told me -- this ceremony

they were attempting required them
to take their own blood and the life
of an innocent to take the soul

So that explains why she killed her
parents and went after you a
pregnant woman Nothing more innocent
than the life of an unborn child

Mia Disturbed the thought of it

Mia nods

CARL (CONTD)
But since youre sitting here they
didnt complete the task

MIA
Something came through

CARL
Well if we believe in ghosts --
like dead people haunting us --
theyre usually associated with
specific locations Your problem is
you moved and strange events are
still occurring

MIA
This sounds crazy

CARL
No crazier than the Red Sea parting
or a talking burning bush or whatever
else To non-believers its all
crazy But who cares about them
right

Yeah Right

CARL (CONTD)
So with what you told me about the
cult and their supposed ceremony
that leaves us with an inhuman spirit

MIA
Inhuman sprit

CARL
Something that never existed in the
flesh

MIA
A demon

Fuller nods
CARL
And they dont attach themselves to
locations They attach themselves to
objects Using them as conduits to
ultimately get what they want

MIA
The soul of an innocent

She looks down at Leah
CARL
So if I was you -- Id get rid of
whatever it is you think its using
to terrorize you

That book slides toward the edge of the shelf and --
Thump Drops

Lands like an inch away from Leah

Another Book on that shelf is about to follow
Thump Lands even closer

More books fall as --

The bookshelf begins to tilt away from the wall
Its going to fall right on Leah if --

MIA

the back of the sofa

Mia enters

MIA
Sorry Father Were running a bit
behind on dinner I havent really
had a chance to cook for others since
Leah was born I might be a little
rusty

PEREZ
Well sacrifices have to be made for
the sake of the children

He hands her a WRAPPED PACKAGE

FATHER PEREZ
Housewarming gift

Mia opens it up
Its the FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Mia and Leah at the church

MIA
Its beautiful Thank you

She sets it down on the entryway table
INT KITCHEN - LATER

A lot of food chewed Not many words said Father Perez knows
hes in the middle of something Feels awkward

His eyes fall on the Occult Books stacked on the counter
Mia catches him looking

MIA
You were the one who preached to
face our fears That the more we
knew of them the less wed be afraid

JOHN
Dont lie to him Mia Hes a priest
for Gods sake
(to Perez re Lords
name in vain)
Sorry

Father Perez shrugs

MIA
Im not lying to him

JOHN
Then tell him the other reason you
have those books

MIA
This isnt confession John

PEREZ
Shes right If she doesnt want to
tell me thats her right

Silence More chewing Then --

MIA
I think the cult that attacked us
conjured up a demon that is after
(MORE )

MIA (CONTD)
Leahs soul I got those books to
try and figure out a way to stop it

Father Perez almost chokes on his Salisbury Steak Certainly
not what he was expecting to hear But wait theres more

JOHN
She also thinks this demon possessed
a doll in her collection too So of
course shes thrown every doll away

MIA
No I didnt say that I said it
attached itself to the doll Not
possessed You can only possess things
that have souls Isnt that right
Father

Uh Uh

PEREZ
»technically yes

MIA
See John is a man of science so he
doesnt really believe in this sort
of thing

JOHN
Thats not fair I believe in God I
believe in the scripture --

MIA
Well its right there in the Bible
Be sober-minded Be watchful Your
adversary the devil prowls around
like a roaring lion --

PEREZ
-- seeking someone to devour

Attention on Father Perez

MIA
What is it that you know about demons
Father

Father Perez sets down his fork Pushes back his plate

PEREZ
In the context of which your asking
Im afraid not much But I do know
that demons just cant take souls
(MORE )
PEREZ (CONTD)
A person has to die before their
soul is released

JOHN
Well I dont plan on doing that
anytime soon What about you Mia

Mia forces a smile

PEREZ
I have heard that some of the churches
around here work with people better
suited for this sort of thing A
married couple apparently If youd
like Ill inquire about them

MIA
Thank you Father

INT APARTMENT ENTRANCE - LATER
Mia and John walk Father Perez to the Front Door

MIA
Thank you for coming over

Perez grabs Mia hand He kisses it

PEREZ
My pleasure And Mia people often
look to religion to find answers to
the unexplained But sometimes
there are more rational explanations
That traumatic experience in your
own home the difficult pregnancy a
new job for your husband a new
baby Thats a lot for anyone

Mia looks over at John Back to Perez

MIA
You think this is in my head

Leah CRIES from the Nursery

As we hear the elevator wheeze its way to the seventh floor
the Forms Apartment Door unlatches and opens

Just an inch or two But enough
Stops right as --

Ding

Father Perez slides the grates back Exits the Elevator And
approaches the Forms Front Door

Sees that its open
Lightly RAPS his knuckles
No answer

Listens and hears --

AN ARGUMENT between John and Mia Muted behind their bedroom

Father Perez creeps over to the sofa

Sees his jacket in a crumpled heap Reaches over and lifts

Sets her aside on the couch

Looks toward the bedroom hearing the argument
Crosses himself

And leaves

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Father Perez steps out into the night Pulls his jacket
tighter round him So cold

Walks down the Front Stairs
Pauses
Like hes got a weird feeling

Steps a few feet back -- off the curb -- into the street --
to get a look at --

There

In the window Seven stories up
Nothing there
