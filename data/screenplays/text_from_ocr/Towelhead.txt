Dont you be scared darlin We’1ll be

getting killed in a car wreck

getting by on his genial sex appeal Concentrating on rinsing
his razor MOVING around him to REVEAL JASIRA standing in the
bathtub behind him wearing a TWO-PIECE BATHING SUIT SHAVING
CREAM is smeared on her inner thighs around her pubic area
Her arms are folded over her newly developed breasts tightly
as she watches Barry in the mirror He catches her eye and
smiles - a sweet genuine smile Jasira smiles back shy

mother GAIL MAROUN (late 30s) appears holding a a small WAD
OF WET BLACK PUBIC HAIR in her hand Gail is attractive but
worn life hasnt turned out the way she thought it would

GAIL

Jasira and Barry both look up at her blank-faced
GAIL
(to Jasira)

OFF JASIRA caught She looks at Barry he just stares back at

TOWELHEAD - 2706 - 3

Jasira knows better than to protest Gail kneels to inspect
Jasiras pubic area which remains unseen to us She is not
pleased by what she discovers

GAIL
Give me the razor

JASIRA
I dont have one I used Barrys

OFF GAIL staring up at her in disbelief

TOWELHEAD - 2706 - 4

GAIL
This whole thing is your fault The
way you walk around sticking your
boobs out its impossible for him not
to notice And youre always talking
about your pubic hair --

JASIRA
Once And only because those girls at
the pool called me Chewbacca

GAIL

I dont even know what that is
JASTRA

Barry does
GAIL

(stares at her sharply)
The bottom line is this Jasira When
Barry offered to shave you you should
have said no There are right ways and
wrong ways to act around men and for
you to learn which is which you
should probably go live with one

Gails anger almost masks the primal vulnerability she hates
that shes feeling right now Almost

Jasira is the only one left on the plane She just sits there

He LAUGHS at his own joke smiles at her she looks up at him
her eyes wide solemn Rifat has an impulse to laugh again -
then catches himself as if reminding himself not to let her
off the hook so easily He studies her critically the last
time he saw her she was a child Now she’s well on her way to
being a woman and it throws him a little Abruptly

shaving when your mother tells you not
to Or asking someone else to do it

JASTRA
I never asked him He volunteered

RIFAT
(points at Thomas)
His jacket is on her bed And his
rubber is in your toilet Hes the
only one here who needs one Right

MELINA
Oh my God

Rifats face is bright red and we can see the veins on his
temples hes so angry

if she’s decided to just give up completely

GIL
Hold on a second -

RIFAT
(sputtering livid)
Go ahead Call the police You have
pictures of her leg and I have this
rubber You are terrible too

THOMAS
Look its all my fault Blame me

RIFAT
Of course I blame you

JASTRA
(quietly)
It’s not his fault

RIFAT
(ignoring her to Melina)
And you for letting my daughter lose
her virginity in this house

JASIRA
(louder to be heard)
I didnt lose it here

Everyone stares at her A beat

THOMAS
She lost it at my house

JASIRA
No

Everyone waits to hear what she says next When she finally
speaks it’s with some trepidation but mostly with relief

JASIRA
(to Rifat)
I lost it at your house Mr Vuoso did
it With his fingers I didnt want
him to but he did

No one moves Total silence for a good ten seconds then
Melina starts to cry

RIFAT
What if I want to stay with my
