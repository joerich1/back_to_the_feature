Adrian walks off into the playground and his Mom watches
while he starts to play with some other kids She walks
away and starts talking to her friend

She periodically looks at Adrian to check up on him She
sees him running and playing with some other kids

After a few checks she looks and Adrian is gone She
begins to scan the playground for him but she can’t see
him anywhere Her looks become frantic as she walks away
from her friend The friend looks baffled as the Mom walks
away without a word The Mom rushes through the playground
looking at every faceless child that isn’t hers It
becomes a blur as she can’t see Adrian

INT DR MOUNTEBANK’S OFFICE — DAY
SUPER “Present Day”

DR MOUNTEBANK sits behind his desk He is a very
distinguished looking man in his sixties His appearance
alone screams pompous His office is dark and decorated
with darker colors There is no nameplate on his desk and
no diplomas of any kind on the walls He has some books on
shelves but his office is marred by out of place hunting
“trophies” There is a mounted deer head behind his desk
a stuffed wolf in the corner of the room and large mounted
fish on the wall This place looks like the Bates Motel
from Psycho

Sitting across from him is Barton He is a 26 year old man
who is dressed in a nice suit with a brightly colored
shirt but without a tie He looks like a nightclub owner

DR MOUNTEBANK
It’s time to progress things with
Adrian
BARTON
I concur He’s become too
complacent all cooped up in that
house It’s sickening and it
needs to stop

DR MOUNTEBANK
I’m glad you see it that way We

will amp up his regiment I
expect you will keep a close
watch

BARTON

Absolutely He’s my
responsibility He needs to move
onStart again This will do us
some good

EXT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

This is a small simple house It has years of wear on it
and it looks like nobody does a lot of upkeep on the
outside of it The grass is a bit too long and the paint
is chipping away

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

he layout of the house is unsophisticated The front door
s centrally located in the entranceway The right side of
he first floor has a large living room and the left side
as a dining room that leads into the kitchen At the
enter of the entranceway is a stair case leading to the
pstairs and next to that is the door to a large one room
asement The second floor has a bathroom at the top of

he stairs On the left side is Barton’s room and the
aster bedroom On the right side is Adrian’s room and the
nd floor office It is designed in such a way that from
he entranceway you can see all the rooms upstairs

CNBACOLADPAHH

The entire house is a cluttered mess There are stacks of
books and newspapers all over the place They line the
walls in all the rooms with the exception of the kitchen
bathroom and Adrian’s Bedroom
2N° FLOOR OFFICE

Adrian now a handsome 25 year old sits in his bathrobe
with stubble on his face His good looks are tarnished by
his current state

He is at the desk looking out the window with binoculars
when he sees a delivery truck pull up across the street
He watches the driver step out of the truck carrying a
package

The driver walks up to the house across the street and
stops just a few paces shy of the front door He looks
over his shoulder and then turns and looks over the other
He makes sure no one is around to see him He steps off to
the side of the front door into some shrubbery

Adrian becomes enraptured in the events unfolding in front
f his eyes He leans forward in his chair eager to see
what happens next

fe)

The driver sets the package down in a flower bed where it
rests among a beautiful assortment that’s in full bloom
He quickly takes another look around to make sure that no
one can see him before he begins to unbutton his pants

Adrian’s eyes widen through the lenses of the binoculars

The driver drops his pants to the ground and squats over
the box

Adrian is glued to the action and unable to look away

The driver’s face winces in an effort to produce something
worthwhile and all at once his wincing ceases as we see a
look of comfort envelope him

Adrian is disgusted and yet he can’t look away

The driver rips one of the flowers out of the dirt and
quickly cleans himself up before he stands up He pulls up
his pants and buttons them as he kicks dirt onto the box to
give his excrement a festive dusting He leans down and
picks up some dirt which he promptly drops onto the box
for one final covering before he picks it back up The
driver holds the box with a few fingers out away from
himself like it was a bomb about to go off He walks back
to the front door of the house where he sets the box down
again He quickly knocks on the door and then runs back to
his truck

Adrian watches the driver get into the truck as he notices
a sign on the back of the truck the reads “Questions or
Comments” and then it lists a phone number He quickly
reaches for his phone and begins to dial the number as the
driver slams on the gas allowing his tires to squeal as he
pulls away

ADRIAN
(on the phone)
Yes I’m calling in regards to one
of your driversLicense plate
number

He looks through the binoculars as he sees the truck
turning the corner

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
814-xXY4FYes I just wanted to
enlighten you to superb job your
driver has done He took such
care in making sure the customer
would never forget this delivery
He brought so much to this one
drop off that I could only assume
he brings the same amount of
struggle and effort to every
package he delivers
Marveloussimply marvelous

Adrian sees his neighbor come out of the house and look
down at the package She seems confused as she picks it
up He sees the neighbor get a quick whiff of the rank
cube in her hands which leads to her quickly dropping the
box The neighbor clutches her chest as they begin to
vomit violently all over the box

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
This package is having such an
effect on everyone it touches I
couldn’t be happier with the
service your driver performed
He’s changing livesNo no
Thank you
Adrian hangs up the phone as he sees Barton’s car pull up
out front He sees Barton step out of the vehicle and head
for the house

ENTRANCEWAY

Barton enters the front door as Adrian comes down the
stairs

ADRIAN
So

BARTON
So

ADRIAN

You here to harp on me or are you
simply here for a quick check up

Barton heads into the living room and Adrian follows
LIVING ROOM

Barton goes and sits in a chair as Adrian comes in and sits
on the couch

The living room is cluttered There are massive stacks of
newspapers and books lining the walls There are a few
family photos around the room We see one photo in
particular which features Adrian when he was 10 Barton
when he was 11 and their parents all posing together

BARTON
I’m not here to harp on you It’s
the same as it always was You’re
here in this house suffering its
tortures The circle perpetuates

ADRIAN
And my rebuttal shall remain the
same I’m content here I don’t
need anything outside of this
house
BARTON
Fifteen years is a long time to
stay cooped up in here The mere
thought seems baffling and I would
have trouble believing it had I
not seen it myself Progress
isn’t a bad thing yah know

ADRIAN
don’t need motivation There’s
no progress to be made

BARTON

The hell there isn’t You need to
stop living in your own sheltered
little world

ADRIAN
t’s my life

Barton smirks at the comment

BARTON
No it’s notIt’s not so much a
life as it is a blueprint of one

ADRIAN
t has meaning for me

BARTON
That it does

ADRIAN
hope you’re cognizant of the
fact that I don’t need constant
checkups

BARTON
Fine

Barton stands up and begins to pace around the room as
exams the debris known as belongings

BARTON
So how’s your love life
(MORE)
BARTON (CONT’D)
Still a continuous cycle of tasty
bits dangling in front of your
ugly mug just out of reach

ADRIAN
There have been some big
developments as of late I have
been talking to this girl named
Lisa and I feel like it’s going
pretty well

BARTON
And you met her how

Barton leans against the wall while he starts to flip
through a book called “Love Wins” by Rob Bell

ADRIAN
On a dating site I’m out there
‘m playing the field

BARTON

Lisa is someone you’ve never met
from a dating site You realize
she is looking for a real
relationship which you can’t
provide Once she realizes that
your chatting will be like Wile E
Coyote dropping off a cliff A
brief glimmer of hope before
plummeting to a painful end

ADRIAN
You don’t know that

BARTON

Yeah I do and if you really want
to test it tell her about your
situation Invite her over for
dinner It won’t work because no
girl will understand your
situation or even come to your
house for a first date

(MORE)
BARTON (CONT’D)
They will want to make sure you
meet in a public place as to
assure you’re not a rapist or some
other such deviant

ADRIAN
Well I can assure you that I can
make it work It doesn’t need to
play out like that

Barton puts the book down and he walks over to Adrian
leans down to him in the chair

BARTON
Here’s a far grander idea for you
to toy with Let it happen that
way Let yourself have a reason
to leave this place

ADRIAN
There is no reason for me to leave
this place Female or otherwise

BARTON
What else do you have in this
bland existence

Adrian looks frustrated with what he’s hearing as Barton
backs away and again leans on the wall

ADRIAN
That’s not the only thing keeping
me going
Barton rolls his eyes
BARTON

What Your job You write
product reviews for websites It
hardly seems like a rewarding
career

ADRIAN
They were enamored with my review
of the puppy pads

Adrian points to some stained puppy pads in the corner

BARTON
You don’t even have a dog You
pissed on those things

ADRIAN
They were meant to soak up urine
and they accomplished said task
End of story Plus I have my
fiction writing

BARTON
Yeah because your GI Joe fan
fiction is really taking you
places

ADRIAN
I just made Roadblock gay So
needless to say I’m truly
tinkering with the core character
dynamics It’s really a brave new
world for the Joes and it has me
plenty occupied

BARTON
It’s just too bad that being
occupied won’t cut it You need
to experience things far greater
than that

ADRIAN
I’m overwhelmingly complacent

BARTON
And that’s the problem True
satisfaction is outside of this
house Friends work women
That’s what your missing and don’t
tell me you don’t want those
things because if you didn’t you
wouldn’t spend so much time online
talking to strangers You crave
something you can never have
ADRIAN
I have everything I need within
the confines of these walls

Barton begins to walk around the room again

BARTON
What happens when you don’t

ADRIAN
Why speculate

BARTON
Because these are things you
should be thinking about You’ve
gone and turned this house into a
prison where you sit in solitary
confinement I’m your sole
contact in this world Therefore
without me around you’ve
literally got nothing

ADRIAN
I like to keep my thoughts based
in reality

BARTON
Stop skirting the issue You’ve
been here far longer than anybody
thought It’s time you moved on

ADRIAN
f you’re being facetious it’s
okay to let me in on that fact

Barton sits back down and stares Adrian down

BARTON
Let me tell you a story

Adrian looks a little baffled by the statement

BARTON (CONT’D)
t’s about a man who survived a
shipwreck and washed up on a
small uninhabited island

(MORE)

BARTON (CONT’D)
He waited for rescue but it never
came so he built himself a small
hut out of driftwood It wasn’t
much but it was enough to store
what little he had and it kept him
sheltered from the brutal heat of
the sun One day he was out
gathering food and when he got
back to his hut it was in flames
He dropped to his knees and cursed
God for his misfortune The next
day a ship came upon the island
and he was rescued He asked the
men on the ship how they found him
and they said they saw his signal
fire

ADRIAN
Let me guess I’m the sheltered
man on the island in need of
rescue

Barton stands up and walks to the front door

BARTON
I don’t know anything about a
rescue but what I do know is that
you’re about to experience the
fire Whether that’s good or bad
for you remains to be seen

Adrian stands up and goes over to Barton by the door
ENTRANCEWAY

ADRIAN
What are you talking about

Barton opens the front door

BARTON
Don’t forget to take your pills
Dr Mountebank will be in touch
He may stop by to check on your
progress

Barton exits the house and leaves Adrian standing alone in
silence

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Adrian sits at his computer in the 2°4 floor office He is
in the midst of a conversation over an instant messaging
program We see that his chat name is YoAdrian and he is
chatting with LisaLisaTurtle You can hear a DING every
time a message is exchanged

ON THE MONITOR

Lisa’s words appear

“Barton sounds really great I
hope I get to meet him someday”

BACK TO ADRIAN

Adrian begins to type a response just as there’s a DING
from another of Lisa’s messages

ON THE MONITOR
Lisa’s words appear

“T hope to meet you someday
toohopefully soon”

BACK TO ADRIAN
Adrian looks panicked as he scrambles for something to say
He stands up from the desk and paces back as he hears
another DING from the computer
ON THE MONITOR
Lisa’s words appear

“Are you still there”

BACK TO ADRIAN

ADRIAN
Fuck
Adrian sits back down and he takes a deep breath as he
places his hands on the keyboard After a moment he
begins to type
ON THE MONITOR
Adrian’s words appear
“T’m not sure I’m ready for that”
Lisa’s words appear
“We’ve been talking for weeks
I’m ready to meet I thought the
feeling was mutual”

BACK TO ADRIAN

Adrian looks scared as a response seems to escape his
shaking fingers

ON THE MONITOR
Lisa’s words appear

“Am I wrong I thought we really
had something here”

Adrian’s words appear

“You’re not mistaken I really do
feel something”

Lisa’s words appear

“Then let’s grab coffee Keep it
simple and quaint”

BACK TO ADRIAN

He rubs his face in frustration
ON THE MONITOR

Adrian’s words appear

“T’m not able to meet for coffee”

Lisa’s words appear

“Would you rather get dinner I
know a great Italian place”

BACK TO ADRIAN

Adrian hops up out of the chair He looks out the window
and he watches a tree blow in the wind He takes in this
small picturesque view of the world he can’t venture into
We see the longing for it in his face as he turns back to
the computer and sits down

ON THE MONITOR

Adrian’s words appear
“Why don’t you come over to my
house I can cook a mean
tortellini Italian just so
happens to be my specialty”

BACK TO ADRIAN

There is a long pause with no response from Lisa and Adrian
begins to look concerned

ON THE MONITOR
Lisa’s words appear

“T’m not comfortable with that I
would rather meet in public”

Adrian’s words appear

“Trust me it will be great Just
the two of us”

Lisa’s words appear

“T can’t You hear so many
stories about creepy guys that
lure woman into bad situations I
have to insist on a public meeting
first”
Adrian’s words appear

“You know I’m not a questionable
guy”

Lisa’s words appear

“Then why won’t you meet me ina
public place”

BACK TO ADRIAN

The moment of truth hits Adrian like a ton of bricks as
has to will his fingers to type the words

ON THE MONITOR
Adrian’s words appear
“There are certain elements about
myself that I’ve been enigmatic
about”
Lisa’s words appear
“T’m waiting”
Adrian’s words appear
“I suffer from agoraphobia”
Lisa’s words appear
“What’s that”
Adrian’s words appear
“It’s an intense fear of crowds
public places and wide open
spaces in general”
Lisa’s words appear
“I don’t care about that Let’s

just meet somewhere without a big
crowd then”

he
Adrian’s words appear
“Tt’s a bit more complicated than
that as my case is a rather
severe”

Lisa’s words appear
“How severe”

Adrian’s words appear

“TIT don’t go outside of my home
At all”

BACK TO ADRIAN
There is a long pause while Adrian nervously waits for a
response and just when he feels it can’t take any longer
there’s a DING from the computer
ON THE MONITOR
Lisa’s words appear
“So you never leave your house”
Adrian’s words appear
“No”
Lisa’s words appear
“Not even for me”
Adrian’s words appear
“T’m sorry I can’t”

BACK TO ADRIAN

Adrian sits and waits for a response that doesn’t seem to
be coming

ON THE MONITOR
Adrian’s words appear

“This shouldn’t change things
I’m still the same gentleman that
you’ve come to know over these
past weeks I’m still me”

BACK TO ADRIAN

Adrian sits and stares at the screen as there is still no
response from Lisa He watches as we see LisaLisaTurtle go
from being labeled “Online” to being labeled “Offline”
Adrian’s face goes pale as he sees this girl slip through
his fingers

He slowly builds a quiet rage that spills over into full
blown as he pushes the chair out from under him The chair
SLAMS violently into the wall has Adrian walks to the
bookshelves and pushes some of the books to the ground as
he YELLS in anger Adrian backs himself into the corner as
he slides down the wall to sit on the ground His eyes
well up with tears and they begin to spill out onto his
distraught face

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian still looking like a mess from his failed
conversation enters the bathroom and grabs his bottle of
pills He opens it and shakes two into his hand before
popping them into his mouth He replaces the bottle and
then takes a drink of water to wash the pills down before
exiting the room

EXT PLAYGROUND — NIGHT - ADRIAN’S DREAM

Adrian’s Mom stands by a police car crying as officers
scramble around her She is distraught as one of the
officers puts a blanket around her Another officer is
standing with her and questioning her

OFFICER
Ma’am can you tell me what the
boy was wearing

She stands in silence unable to respond

OFFICER (CONT’D)
Ma’am please Any information
you can give us would help us in
locating your child

She still stands in silence as the officer reaches out and
places his hand on her shoulder Her head darts up as she
stares the officer down and we hear the sound of a door
SLAM

CUT TO
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

he SLAM of a door is heard from downstairs as it awakens
drian

PH

drian is in his bedroom sleeping in his small twin bed
hich still has dinosaur sheets on it His room hasn’t
ged with him and it still looks as though it belongs toa
O year old

Hos BP

The SLAM of a door is heard from downstairs as it awakens
Adrian He slowly lifts his head as he looks around He
seems truly groggy and out of it

ADRIAN
Hello

Adrian gets out of bed but he uses the room to stabilize
himself He can’t seem to function properly as he stumbles
out of the room

UPSTAIRS

Adrian stumbles out of his room and he looks down the
stairs at the front door A SHADOW QUICKLY FLASHES past
the outside of the window by the door Adrian is
disoriented and not sure of what he sees

ADRIAN
Hello Is somebody there This

isn’t funny

Adrian makes his way down the steps

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian gets to the front door and he looks out the window
next to it His eyes scan the front yard looking for
anything He sees nothing and then the grabs the doorknob
He unlocks the door and twists the knob He hesitates for
a moment before opening the door a small crack He peers
out the crack he made in the door and a small breeze sends
a chill down his back as he freaks out and closes the door
He quickly locks the door and he rests his head against it
while he takes a few deep breaths Even the smallest
exposure has caused him great discomfort

Adrian turns and sits down at the bottom of the stairs as
he focuses his gaze on the front door His eyelids become
anvils as they begin to drop He quickly opens his eyes
again but he can’t stave off his drowsiness as it
overtakes him

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

Adrian is still seated at the bottom of the stairs He is
still sleeping as drool oozes out of the corner of his
mouth and down his chin The early morning sun creeps in
through the window and it makes its way up his face The
warmth of the sun is enough to wake Adrian who promptly
stretches and looks around as he wipes the drool away from
his face He stands up and goes to the door where he looks
out the window There is nothing to see as he backs away
and ascends the stairs

MONTAGE — ADRIAN’S DAY
-- He brushes his teeth
-- He does some pushups

-- He caresses the stubble on his face before he grabs his
razor

-- He does some sit ups

-- He showers

-- He opens the front door a sliver and checks to make sure
it’s okay before he reaches his arm out to grab the
newspaper that is sitting in front of the door Once he

has the paper he SLAMS the door shut He locks it and
drops to the ground to try and slow his breathing and to
stop himself from shaking

-- He eats a bowl of cereal while reading the newspaper in
the kitchen

-- He opens up a box for a foot bathfoot massage and he
looks it over

-- He has his feet planted in the foot bath while he types
up a review for it on his computer

END MONTAGE
INT DR MOUNTEBANK’S OFFICE -— DAY

Dr Mountebank sits at his desk while Barton sits on the
other side of it

BARTON
Why start small Why not just
dish it out like a blunt force
trauma

DR MOUNTEBANK
Do you doubt my practices

BARTON
Not at all

DR MOUNTEBANK

Then I implore you to keep to the
path and leave your mind focused
on the task at hand

BARTON

It’s just that I’ve been looking
forward to this The end you
know

DR MOUNTEBANK
You must quell such thoughts All
will happen as it should and I
promise it will make the end
result that much more satisfying

Barton nods in the affirmative
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

Adrian is in the 2 floor office putting the foot bath back
into its box as hear hears the BEEPING of a truck backing
up He looks out his window and sees a moving truck coming
to a stop in front of the house next door The moving
truck has a picture of an old man riding a crocodile on the
side just below the words “Agares Movers”

A woman steps out of the driver’s seat of the moving truck
and walks into the front yard of the house She grabs the
FOR SALE sign out of the front yard and she tosses it to

the ground

Adrian grabs his binoculars and he looks at the woman

This is RAZIELA She has long flowing hair a slender
figure and a beautiful face His heart skips a beat as he
drinks in her perfection She moves in slow motion as in
his eyes she is on a higher plane of existence

The woman looks around the neighborhood taking in her
surroundings She looks up at the window where Adrian is
seated

Adrian locks eyes with Raziela for a quick minute before he
realizes it He rapidly rolls out of his chair and onto
the floor so that he is out of site He sits up against
the wall and cracks a huge smile

ADRIAN
Wow

Adrian lets a moment pass before taking a peek out the
window He scans the yard but doesn’t see the woman He
sits back in his chair but he moves it back away from the
window a bit He looks at the moving truck and sees a
phone number on the side of it He picks up his phone and
dials the number on the truck There is a CLICK from the
phone followed by an automated voice

AUTOMATED VOICE (OS)
You’ve reached the afterhours
answering service for Agares
Movers
(MORE)

AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT’D)
Please leave us your name number
and reason for calling and we will
get back to you Thank You

Adrian hangs up as he sees Raziela come back out of the
house He watches her go to the truck and open up the back
door She grabs a box and carries it back into the house
Adrian settles into his chair to enjoy the rest of the
show

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Adrian enters the bathroom and he grabs his pills He
quickly takes two of them and he washes them down with

water before exiting the room

INT BASEMENT — NIGHT — ADRIAN’S DREAM

A pitch black basement with a dirt floor where nothing is
visible and all you hear is the sound of a young boy
crying

You hear the creak of a door open and a bright light shines
down the basement stairs illuminating a 10 year old Adrian
crying at the base of the steps Adrian wipes the tears
from his eyes as small glimmer of hope enters them

It’s at this moment that a shadow steps into the doorway
The shadow looks to be that of a large man and it quickly
blocks the light that was embracing Adrian The shadow
stands motionless just looking down at Adrian Aftera
moment the shadow begins to descend the stairs towards
Adrian as the young boy disappears into the shadow

CUT TO
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian’s eyes shoot open as he comes to in his bedroom
The sound of muffled unclear voices can be heard from
outside the room Adrian again is groggy and having
trouble waking up He hears the voices and he forces
himself up out of bed He uses the room to stabilize
himself as he makes his way to the door
ADRIAN
Hello Is there someone there

Adrian opens the door of his bedroom and he steps out into

the area atop the steps
UPSTAIRS

Adrian looks down the stairs and he sees shadows moving
about in the dining room

ADRIAN
Who’s there Who’s in my house

Adrian begins to descend the stairs
DINING ROOM
We hear people scramble out of the room as Adrian enters
ADRIAN
I’m not playing around Who’s

here This isn’t funny Barton

The backdoor SLAMS as Adrian turns towards it Adrian
walks to the kitchen

ITCHEN

Adrian goes to the back door and he looks out into the
backyard There is nothing and no one there

Adrian steps away from the door and he goes to the sink
He is still disoriented and drowsy He uses the sink to
splash water on his face in an effort to wake himself up

He steps back into the dining room

DINING ROOM

Adrian grabs a chair from the table and he sets it in the
corner He sits in the chair so that he can see from all
directions

His eyelids begin to envelope his eyes as sleep once again
wins the battle with consciousness

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

The front door to the house opens and Barton enters
carrying a bag of groceries He looks into the dining room
and he sees Adrian asleep in the chair

DINING ROOM
Barton walks over to Adrian and he nudges him to wake him
up Adrian comes to and shakes off his slumber as he sees
his brother
BARTON
What are you doing sleeping down

here

Adrian picks away the crust in his eyes as he gathers
himself

ADRIAN
I’ve been weathering a storm here
People There have been people in
the house

Barton looks confused

BARTON
That’s not possible

Adrian stands up as they walk into the kitchen
KITCHEN

ADRIAN
Oh it’s possible

Barton puts the bag of groceries down on the counter

BARTON
It was probably just a bad dream

ADRIAN
I’ve had bad dreams This was no
dream There were people here
BARTON
Have you been taking your
medication

ADRIAN
Every day

BARTON
Then let’s just bring it on back
It was probably just a bad dream
You know your medication keeps all
the bad at bay

Barton begins to walk around the kitchen while putting the
groceries away Adrian follows him around like a lost
puppy

ADRIAN
Apparently not because I’ve taken
a swan dive into the deep end of
insanity

BARTON
I’m not sure what you want from
me I can talk to Mountebank and
maybe get you another medication

ADRIAN
This isn’t about popping another
pill or two I want the locks
changed and I want to add more
locks to the door I want locks
on locks Can we padlock the
locks

nq

BARTON

You don’t need to add more locks
f somebody wanted in they will
get in This is a house not Fort
Knox

ADRIAN
I am under the impression that
you’re not taking my concerns
seriously

BARTON
How long have we been doing this
This isn’t my first rodeo It was
a bad dream let’s move on

ADRIAN
I would prefer not to

Barton grabs a box of food and pats Adrian on the back

BARTON
Alright Bartlebythe scrivener
right Yeah I caught that one
Now let’s get some food in you

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

Adrian is sitting in the computer chair in the 2°¢ floor
office looking out the front window with binoculars He
sees a truck for a lawn care company across the street He
watches the men working on the yard across the street as he
notices the phone number on the truck He grabs the phone
to make a phone call as he hears a KNOCK at the front door
He stands up and walks out of the room

UPSTAIRS

Adrian looks downstairs and sees Raziela standing in the
entranceway

ADRIAN
You must be insane if you think
it’s ok to simply walk into
someone’s house

RAZIELA
You should probably lock your door
then

ADRIAN

I can assure you that it was
without a doubt locked

Raziela points over her shoulder with her thumb at the
unlocked door

RAZIELA
Obviously not

Adrian makes his way down the stairs
ENTRANCEWAY

ADRIAN
That doesn’t change the fact that
you can’t come walking into my
house uninvited

RAZIELA
And you shouldn’t spy on your
neighbors with binoculars and yet
the world keeps turning

Adrian appears a bit ashamed

ADRIAN
I don’t spy

RAZIELA
That wasn’t you upstairs watching
me through binoculars

ADRIAN
Wellyes but it was a far cry
from espionage I merely like to
keep a watchful eye on the
neighborhood

Raziela walks into the living room and Adrian follows her

RAZIELA
Sounds like spying to me

Raziela begins to walk around the room and look at the
photos and books that are all over the place

ADRIAN
I don’t go out much I need to
stay fresh on what’s going on in
my neighborhood
Raziela starts
around

RAZIELA
Yeah I know The neighbors told
me

ADRIAN

The neighbors

RAZIELA
Yeah I’ve been getting to know
everybody and they told me all
about you I thought that you
sounded super fucked up so I just
had to come meet you

ADRIAN
I’m not “super fucked up”

RAZIELA
You haven’t been outside in 15
years

ADRIAN

Technically but—

RAZIELA
That’s super fucked up

picking up some of the books and moving them
RAZIELA (CONT’D)

You need to clean up You got
definite hobo swag going on

Adrian walks over and takes the books from her and he puts
them back where they came from

ADRIAN
You seem to be under the
impression that you have the right
to intrude and just start moving
my personal effects

RAZIELA
Okay I’m just trying to help
ADRIAN
I don’t need your assistance

RAZIELA
Could have fooled me

Raziela grabs the remote control off the coffee table and
she turns the TV on She flips it to channel 15 which
features an awful reality show Adrian sees the 15 on the
TV and he snatches the remote from Raziela’s hand He
quickly changes the channel

ADRIAN
Please do not lay your hands on
anything

RAZIELA

Shit If you don’t like the show
just say so

ADRIAN
t’s not the show It’s the
number

RAZIELA
The number What like the
channel

ADRIAN
have a thing about that number

RAZIELA
Fifteen

Adrian twitches from the sound of the word

ADRIAN
I do not care for it I can’t
explain it but every time I have
contact with that number in any
way I feel pain It’s
practically excruciating

RAZIELA
Okay then

Raziela rolls her eyes as she steps away from the TV

ADRIAN
If you insist on being here
please sit down and refrain from
touching anything

Raziela holds up her hands and looks sarcastically offended
as she walks away She sits in a chair and Adrian goes to
the couch

RAZIELA
So what do you do all day You’ve
got to be bored as shit

ADRIAN
I have plenty that occupy my time

Raziela grabs a notebook off the coffee table and starts
flipping through it She sees all of Adrian’s hand written
stories

RAZIELA
What are you writing

Adrian grabs the notebook and closes it
ADRIAN
It is fiction that I’m writing for

eyes that aren’t yours

Raziela picks up the photo of Adrian Barton and their
parents

RAZIELA
Are those your parents Where are
they

ADRIAN

Yes They have passed away

Adrian grabs the photo from her and he puts it back where
it was

RAZIELA
Sorry that sucks Is that why
you don’t go outside and shit

ADRIAN
They are unrelated

RAZIELA
Then what does it have something
to do with

ADRIAN
Being as how we are merely getting
acquainted at this juncture and I
don’t even know your name I would
rather not talk about that

Raziela puts the picture down and Adrian looks frustrated

RAZIELA
Right sorry

Raziela puts her hand out to shake hands

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
I’m Raziela but my friends call

me Razi Pronounced like Nazi
but Razi You should call me
Razi

Adrian shakes her hand

ADRIAN
Adrian It’s nice to make your
acquaintance Razi a rather
atypical name though

RAZIELA
It wasn’t my choice but I make
do

Raziela looks around the room as Adrian smirks at her
comment

RAZIELA (CONT’D)
So when was the last time a woman
was in this place By the looks
of things it’s been a while No
female touch

ADRIAN
Not since my mother passed

RAZIELA
I could help you

ADRIAN
What help could you possibly offer
me

RAZIELA

Clean this place up You
knowmaybe make it look less
like a homeless shelter and more
like a home Get rid of that hobo
swag

Adrian looks baffled

ADRIAN
Why would you want to help me
Did my brother put you up to this

Raziela stands up

RAZIELA
Look I’m just trying to be
neighborly You could use some
help and I’m offering it

Raziela walks to the front door
RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
Think about it and if you decide
youd like my help just stare at
me awkwardly through your
binoculars and I’11l come running

Raziela exits the house and Adrian just looks so confused

ADRIAN
A bit brazen

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian sits at his desk in the 2 floor office He is on
the computer looking at internet porn He clicks ona

“voyeur” video and it begins to play Adrian sees a man
watching through a window while a woman undresses herself
Adrian’s hand begins to venture beneath the desk towards
his crotch We see quick flashes of Raziela’s face as
Adrian touches himself It intensifies and we see a quick
flash of Raziela stripping and dancing We see quick
flashes back and forth from Raziela to Adrian There are
quick flashes of Raziela dancing naked in front of fire
These flashes get faster and faster until Adrian finishes
and he leans back in his chair

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Adrian enters his bathroom and he grabs his bottle of
pills He shakes two out into his hand and he stares them
down

ADRIAN
Here’s hoping

He tosses the pills into his mouth and he swallows them
with some water before exiting the bathroom

INT BASEMENT — NIGHT — ADRIAN’S DREAM

Ten year old Adrian lies face down in the dirt floor of the
basement His eyes are full of tears as we see the shadowy
figure of a man by the bottom of the stairs The man is
zipping up his pants and doing up his belt He walks up
the stairs and he leaves Adrian lying face down in the dirt
as he slams the basement door and the darkness once again
engulfs the young boy in life shattering despair

CUT TO
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE —- DAY
Adrian snaps awake in his bed covered in sweat from the
dream he just had He is breathing hard as he throws the
sheets of himself and get out of bed
ENTRANCEWAY
Adrian walks down the stairs as he rubs the sleep out of
his eyes He stops and glances quickly into the living

room before heading towards the kitchen He abruptly stops
and turns back towards the living room

LIVING ROOM

Adrian dashes into the room as he looks around The room
is clean His books are all nicely arranged on shelves and
the clutter has been cleaned up His face is in shock as
he wanders around the room looking through all his books to
make sure they are still there He looks over the family
photos as he can’t believe the state of the room He
begins to pull books from the shelves and move things
about He begins to make the room a beautiful mess again

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - DAY

Barton enters the house where Adrian is sitting on the
steps anxiously waiting for him Adrian jumps up and
points into the living room

ADRIAN
Look atat thisthis What
the hell

LIVING ROOM

Barton looks at the room while Adrian walks about pointing
at the changes

BARTON
Yeah it’s clean

ADRIAN
I think that Razi was the
perpetrator

BARTON
Razi Who the hell is Razi

ADRIAN
Razi the devilish female that
resides next door

BARTON
I didn’t realize that someone
bought that place

ADRIAN
She was here yesterday rambling on
about how she could clean this
place up for me I think she came
in while I was sleeping and she
messed with the whole feng shui in
an effort to screw with me

Barton grabs Adrian by the shoulders to calm him

BARTON
Two things First I’m glad you
talked to a real live woman
That’s big stuff Second it
wasn’t her It was me

ADRIAN
You Why The violation of my
personal space is beyond words

Adrian shirks off Barton’s hands and walks away from him

Barton takes a

BARTON
did it for you

ADRIAN
t’s an intrusion into everything
hold dear

BARTON

Or it’s your brother trying to
keep your home looking good You
should live well where you dwell

ADRIAN
Why not talk with me before you
make changes Why do it while I’m
sleeping

seat on the couch

BARTON
Because I knew you would
overreact which is why I didn’t
tell you You’re welcome by the
way

ADRIAN
You will receive no gratitude from
meWait Does that mean the
sounds I heard in the house a few
nights ago were you as well

BARTON
No Like I told you before I had
nothing to do with that It was
probably a dream

ADRIAN
I’m not sure my sense of calm can
trust you At the very least
would you be kind enough to
divulge the location of the rest
of my belongings There are
missing items

BARTON
They’re in the basement

Adrian can’t stop pacing through the room
ADRIAN

The basement You know I don’t go
down there

BARTON
Well if you want your things
that’s where they are

Adrian goes out into the entranceway of the house and
Barton follows behind him

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian goes to the basement door behind the stairs and he
stops when he sees a numeric keypad that locks the door

ADRIAN
What sort of hell are you trying
to put me in

BARTON
I added a lock to the door
(MORE)

BARTON (CONT’D)
If you want your things you’ll
have to put in the code and go get

them

ADRIAN
And the code just so happens to be
what

BARTON
All you have to do is hit star
fifteen

A shudder of pain flows through Adrian as he hears the
code

ADRIAN
Why would you do that

BARTON
Because it’s necessary

Barton goes to the front door and exits the house as Adrian
stands staring at the keypad

Adrian examines the keypad with his hands looking for the
screws or a spot to undo it but he can’t see anything

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - DAY

Adrian is in his kitchen cooking when the sound of the
front door opening and closing is heard

ADRIAN
Barton Is that you

Raziela enters the kitchen

RAZIELA
Not the last time I checked

Adrian stops what he’s doing

ADRIAN
Your trespassing needs to cease
RAZIELA
Stop leaving your door open

ADRIAN
The door is never unlocked With
the certainty of death and taxes
I locked that door

Adrian seems frustrated and confused

Raziela points

RAZIELA
Then talk to the person who
screwed the pooch on that one

towards the living room

RAZIELA (CONT’D)
I saw you cleaned up your living
room I dig it It’s a good
start

ADRIAN
I took no part in that travesty
My brother or so he claims to be
took it upon himself to accomplish
that particular feat

Raziela walks over to the counter where Adrian is
starts to pick through his food

RAZIELA
Brother huh That’s super nice
of him Like rainbows and
sunshine kind of nice

ADRIAN
Or an invasion of my sanctum I
feel violated Just like the
moment I find myself currently in
while you sift through my food

Raziela takes a bite of the food

RAZIELA
So sorry Adrian Maybe I should
just leave

and

Raziela starts to leave the kitchen as Adrian goes back to
his food Raziela stops and turns back towards him

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
That is unless I got invited to
dinner

ADRIAN
This portion was meant for one

Raziela throws her hands up

RAZIELA
You know I get it now

Adrian stops and looks at her

ADRIAN
Get what

RAZIELA
Why you’ve been alone all these
years It’s not because you don’t
like being around people It’s
because people don’t like being
around you It’s because you’re a
piece of shit Deep down you’re
just a bad man

Raziela exits the kitchen as Adrian gets a look of
frustration

ADRIAN
StopI could turn this into two
meals I guess

Raziela walks back into the kitchen

RAZIELA
See was that so hard

ADRIAN
You’re impossible
DINING ROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER

Adrian and Raziela are sitting down together at the
table eating

ADRIAN
Do you really think that I’ma
“piece of shit” as you so put it

RAZIELA
Kind of but it’s probably due
more to the fact that you lack
simple skills in human interaction
rather than the fact that you’re
actually an ass You just need to
get out more

ADRIAN
Now you’re mimicking my brother

RAZIELA
I’1l1 take sounding like over
looking like

ADRIAN
No you look--

Adrian looks her over

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
--absolutely fine

Raziela looks a bit taken aback

RAZIELA
Were you checking me out

Adrian’s cheeks get rosy with embarrassment

ADRIAN
No I wasn’t I was simply--

Raziela gives Adrian a quick punch to the shoulder

RAZIELA
You were checking me out

dinner

Adrian is speechless

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
It’s okay I’m used to guys
checking me out Plus you
probably haven’t seen a woman in
the flesh for some time I have
to be a system shock for you

ADRIAN
I assure you that my system
remains un-shocked

Raziela sports a devilish smile

RAZIELA
Have you jerked off while thinking
about me

Adrian’s embarrassment only intensifies as he nervously
laughs

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
You did You had filthy dream sex
with me while touching your penis
Was I good

ADRIAN
You lack a filter

RAZIELA
Don’t change the subject Was I
good

ADRIAN

I was able to achieve the goal I
set out with

Raziela laughs as she gives Adrian another playful punch in
the shoulder

RAZIELA
You are one dirty birdie Deep
down you really are a bad man If
you weren’t so sheltered I might
have to call you a pervert
ADRIAN
I don’t think I have the deviant
nature of a pervert

RAZIELA
It’s honestly a compliment You
have millions of filthy sluts to
choose from on the internet but
you chose me I feel flattered

ADRIAN
This is not the kind of
conversation I was expecting

RAZIELA

Nonsense you need to break out of
your shell You are all cooped up
in here with no one to talk to
You need this You need actual
human beings to talk to so that a
conversation like this doesn’t
freak you out

ADRIAN

Is that so Is this customary
everyday conversation for those
outside this house People
reminiscing about masturbation
If that is the case it makes the
world seem even less appealing
and possibly a literally filthy
place

RAZIELA

And you think that I have a dirty
mind but you’re the one thinking
about a world dripping in filth
You sick bastard

ADRIAN
You started down this path

RAZIELA
Maybe but you won’t talk to me
about yourself so we had to talk
about something

ADRIAN
I am not a terribly fascinating
subject to dwell upon Every tale
I tell takes place in this house
and they aren’t exactly
enthralling yarns

RAZIELA
What about the story that caused
you to lock yourself up in this
house

Adrian pushes his food away as a look of dissatisfaction
overtakes him

ADRIAN
That is not a story for a newcomer
in my life

RAZIELA
And yet I’m good enough to make
filthy dream love to You will
open up to meOne of these days

ADRIAN
MaybeOne of these days

Raziela plays with her food for a moment before perking up

RAZIELA
So what’s it like

ADRIAN
What’s what like

RAZIELA
When you step outside You have
to feel something when it happens
otherwise you wouldn’t have a
problem going out there

Adrian sits and thinks about it for a moment

ADRIAN
I imagine it would compare to

being thrown
(MORE)
ADRIAN (CONT’D)
out of an airplane without a
parachute or coming to the
realization that you’re about to
wreck your car in a deathly
fashion and knowing there is
nothing you can do to prevent it
from coming to fruition All of
the sudden I begin to tremble and
I have a shortness of breath while
I struggle to even maintain
consciousness The world is all
at once focused on my shortcomings
and I feel the gravity of that
monumental judgment on my buckling
shouldersI remember a time when
I was about 12 Barton couldn’t
fathom what I was going through
In his mind I was just faking my
ailment and one day he grabbed
me by the front door He opened
it and threw me out onto the
porch I don’t remember what
happened but my uncle he was
raising us at the time he told me
that I was screaming and crying
while I pounded out every ounce of
energy I had on the door in an
effort to get back inside to the
safety of these walls I don’t
remember my actions but what I do
remember is the anxiety and pain I
felt from the simple exposure to
what I felt was unsafe When I
came to on the couch after my
uncle carried me in I saw Barton
with a look of shock as he stared
at me from the corner That was
the first time I knew he
understood that my pain was real

Raziela sees the sincerity in Adrian’s eyes as she reaches
out and holds his hand

RAZIELA
You need to get your shit under
control cause that’s fucked up
stuff

ADRIAN
I wish to thank you for your kind
words as I now feel much better
about having opened up to you

Raziela smiles

RAZIELA
I’m kidding I’m a playful sort

Adrian musters up a small yet restrained smirk
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Adrian enters the bathroom and he grabs his pills He
takes two pills and exits the bathroom

EXT PLAYGROUND — DAY — ADRIAN’S DREAM

A 10 year old Adrian runs and plays on the playground
equipment He keeps looking up and seeing his mother
talking to her friend He waves at his mother and she
waves back as he smiles and continues to play

Adrian climbs up the slide and he slides to the bottom He
goes to stand up as the large shadow of a man looms over
him He looks up and sees the shadowy figure looking down
at him

The bright sunny day now turns to a dark night

Adrian looks around and sees nobody The playground is now
empty There are no kids playing and his mother is gone
He turns to the playground equipment and he watches it
disappear

The playground is now the dark dirt floor basement he was
trapped in

INT BASEMENT -— NIGHT — ADRIAN’S DREAM - CONTINUOUS

Adrian walks over to the corner and slouches down to the
ground as the dark shadow of a man walks over to him

CUT TO
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

Adrian wakes up breathing hard He tries to shake it off
as the sunlight washes over him with its warm glow He
slowly gets himself out of bed

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian walks down the steps as he ties the belt on his
bathrobe He turns into the dining room

DINING ROOM

Adrian walks into the dining room and it looks straightened
up as his books and newspapers are missing He looks angry
as he walks to the kitchen

KITCHEN

Adrian sees that the kitchen is all straightened up and he
hurries to the phone and he begins to dial The phone
rings and we hear the BEEP of a voicemail

BARTON (OS)
Hey you’ve reached Barton Leave
me your name and number and I’11
get back to you as soon as I can

ADRIAN
(on the phone)
Stop screwing with my stuff
Violating my home I don’t need
you moving and cleaning Leave my
home be

Adrian slams the phone down and looks over his kitchen in
frustration

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

Adrian is sitting in his living room writing fan fiction in
his notebook when the front door opens and Raziela enters

RAZIELA
I thought you were going to start
locking that door

ADRIAN
At a certain point it becomes
futile as your reappearance was
imminent

Adrian puts the book down as Raziela looks into the dining
room

RAZIELA
It looks like your brother gave
you another quick polish

ADRIAN
Regrettably He is starting to
test the limits of my good nature

RAZIELA
Lighten up and embrace it It’s
good for you

Raziela steps into the living room and she sits down next
to Adrian It’s much closer than his comfort zone would
like to allow

ADRIAN
Just make yourself comfortable

RAZIELA
As if I wouldn’t

ADRIAN
Your veracious nature demands it

RAZIELA
So how are you going to entertain
me today
ADRIAN
Don’t you have an occupation you
must frequent

RAZIELA
I work mostly nights and right now
I would rather relax

ADRIAN
What is your occupation

Raziela smiles as she puts her hand on Adrian’s leg

RAZIELA
Do you really want to know Is it
picking at that weird little brain
of yours

ADRIAN
I do find myself oddly intrigued
by what you do with your time

RAZIELA
I’m a dancer

ADRIAN
What like ballet

RAZIELA
No fuck-tard I’m a stripper

ADRIAN
A stripper

RAZIELA
Yeah you know like I get up ona
stage and have men pay me to take
my clothes off

Adrian looks a little flustered as Raziela pats Adrian on
the head

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
Aw you’re thinking about me naked
again aren’t you
Raziela inches
her arm around

ADRIAN
No I just--

RAZIELA
Don’t worry it’s like I said I’m
used to guys checking me out

ADRIAN
It doesn’t cause feelings of
anxiety

RAZIELA
No why should it know I look
good so why not let it work for
me

ADRIAN
Your level of confidence is
something that I’m not privy to

RAZIELA
I’m sure there’s a lot you’re not
used to

closer to Adrian on the couch and she
him

ADRIAN
Your actions perplex me

RAZIELA
You’re probably not used to a
woman being this close to you
Plus I know you thought about me
naked

ADRIAN
This is not copasetic

Raziela grabs Adrian by the jaw

RAZIELA
Of course you aren’t You’re so
sheltered that the simple things
in life have eluded you Have you
ever even kissed a girl

puts

Adrian simply shakes his head “no”

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
Good

Raziela leans in and kisses Adrian Her form is perfect
but he seems taken aback and very stunned as his eyes
remain open and his lips seem tight After a moment
Raziela pulls back and lets Adrian ease away

RAZIELA
There now you’ve kissed a girl

ADRIAN
WhyWhy did you do that

Raziela stands up and she pulls Adrian up to his feet

RAZIELA
Because it makes me feel good to
make you uncomfortable I know
that you just haven’t been able to
enjoy what so many of us take for
granted and it freaks you out I
haven’t felt this good since I
took Billy Thatcher’s virginity
Poor guy he needed that

ADRIAN

Is that why you find the time to
come over here because I’ma
charity case that you like
screwing with

RAZIELA

Youre far beyond a charity case
but I do enjoy messing with you
It’s kind of my thing

Adrian steps away from Raziela
ADRIAN

I’m confused about how I should
feel
RAZIELA
What’s to know I feel good and
you got kissed Let’s move on
Do you want to grab my tits

Adrian looks shocked as he turns and looks at Raziela

ADRIAN
I feel as though you are really
expediting things

RAZIELA
They’re just tits I whip them
out every night for guys who don’t
look half as good The other day
there was this like 400 pound guy
who got winded just standing up
He bought a dance in the champagne
room for a half hour He was so
fat that I couldn’t even feel his
dick through his pants You can
always feel a guy get hard through
their pants and there is no way
that fatty magoo wasn’t rockin’ a
chub I mean look at me but
nothing because he was so fat
His dick was like lost in the fat
rolls It was gross at the same
time that it was almost a
fascinating mystery you wanted to
solve Anyway that was a long
winded way of saying I’ve done
worse for uglier people

Adrian just looks at her in silence as she begins to grow
tired of it Raziela reaches up and grabs on her own
chest

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
See nothing to it It’s just
flesh

ADRIAN
My level of unease is staggeringly
high right now
Raziela rolls her eyes as she grabs Adrian’s hand and
places it on her breast

RAZIELA
See was that so hard

After a moment of grasping Adrian retracts his hand

RAZIELA
Pretty spectacular right

ADRIAN
It was nice

RAZIELA

Nice You just grabbed your first
tit and now you lack the words to
tell me how you feel Come on
make a girl feel special Hit me
with some great words so that I
don’t feel self-conscious about my
boobs

ADRIAN
They were delightful

RAZIELA
You can do better

ADRIAN
They were striking impressive
staggering

RAZIELA
Doing better Hit me with a few
more

ADRIAN

Phenomenal extraordinary
fantastic marvelous outstanding
unparalleled wondrous
tremendous unreal out of this
world scintillating sumptuous
brilliant sublime transcendent
ultimate supreme unrivaled
consummate
Raziela smiles as she puts her hand on Adrian’s arm

RAZIELA
Aw thanks You sure do know how
to make a girl feel special

ADRIAN
It was the single most grandiose
experience I have ever had the
pleasure of taking part in Your
breast has caused my mind to go
adrift It’s gotten off to I
know not where I find myself
grasping at straws in an effort to
safely replant my feet back onto
solid ground as I feel as though
I’m floating on air I can barely
articulate the gratitude I have
developed for the act that you
have performed here today In all
my years I have often pondered
what such an experience could have
possibly felt like

Raziela puts out her hands to stop Adrian from talking
RAZIELA
Thanks I appreciate it but you

can stop now

ADRIAN
Right

Adrian goes back to the couch and sits down
RAZIELA
This has been a big day for you

hasn’t it

ADRIAN
Just a smidgen past the norm

Raziela sits down next to Adrian and looks at him

RAZIELA
We made good progress here today
I can’t even begin to imagine how
you would handle sex

Adrian looks shocked

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
Oh calm down We’re not having
sex But if we did I would rock
your world

ADRIAN
Knowledge I am pleased to know

RAZIELA
You’re probably a premature
ejaculator aren’t you

ADRIAN
I don’t--

Raziela slaps Adrian on the arm

RAZIELA
You don’t have to answer that
Besides most guys are quick on
the trigger their first time out
Billy Thatcher barely lasted a
minute

Wow
RAZIELA

All this makes you uncomfortable
doesn’t it

ADRIAN
Extremely

RAZIELA
And that’s why you fascinate me
This might not be a conversation
for polite company but it’s not
unusual
(MORE)

RAZIELA (CONT’ D)
Yet you have never talked to
anyone like this so it’s painful
and out of your comfort zone I
like it That’s where you need to
be Outside your comfort zone

ADRIAN
Youll find me a tad bit
disagreeable on that particular
notion

Raziela sees that Adrian is tense and uncomfortable

RAZIELA
All right All right You look
like you’re about to shit a brick
I’1l stop How about we watch a
movie or something

ADRIAN
That I could handle

RAZIELA
Excellent

A SHORT TIME LATER

Raziela is lying on the couch with her head resting in
Adrian’s lap as they watch “Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey”
Adrian seems more focused on Raziela’s head in his lap
rather than the movie

Raziela grabs the remote and turns the volume on the TV up
She turns it up to 15 and then sets the remote down

Adrian quickly grabs the remote and turns the volume down
to 14

Raziela sits up and looks at Adrian

RAZIELA
I just thought of something

ADRIAN
Can it wait until the movie is
over
RAZIELA
We can watch this movie anytime
but I might only have this thought
once Do you really want to
squander it

ADRIAN
Touché What’s on your mind

RAZIELA
How have you not woken up when
your brother comes in to rearrange
your house It had to have been
loud Are you a heavy sleeper

Adrian seems to be taken aback by the comment

ADRIAN
That’s actually a really good
thought

RAZIELA

Those are the only kind I have

ADRIAN
How is that possible

Adrian stands up from the couch and begins to pace through
the room

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
You’re right I shouldn’t have
slept through that How could I
have not heard something

RAZIELA
That’s what I’m saying

Adrian stays silent as he paces and thinks He is struck
by an idea

ADRIAN
The pills

RAZIELA
Pills

ADRIAN
Yeah Barton gave me the
medication It has always made me
drowsy and I’ve recently starting
seeing and hearing things that
couldn’t possibly be in the house
It has to be the medication

RAZIELA
So you’re saying your brother
drugged you so he can come in here
and rearrange your stuff Why
What’s the point

ADRIAN
Maybe he’s under the impression
that by messing with the house he
can force me out of it Make it
an uncomfortable place to be and I
won’t want to be here anymore
Well it’s not going to work
I’1l stop the medication and he
won’t be able to pull the wool
over my eyes any more

RAZIELA
Cool beans

Adrian looks baffled

ADRIAN
Cool beans

RAZIELA
Yeah it means awesome

ADRIAN
Why Don’t people generally enjoy
their beans hot

RAZIELA
It’s just a saying

ADRIAN
It seems to be an ill-conceived
one as the phrase lacks logic

RAZIELA
Hey I don’t right ‘em I just say
‘em

ADRIAN
Right

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian enters the bathroom and he grabs his bottle of
pills He opens the bottle and dumps the contents of it
into the toilet He flushes the toilet and watches his
pills circle the bowl before disappearing into obscurity
Adrian puts the top back on the pill bottle and then tosses
it into the trash can before he exits the room

ADRIAN’S ROOM

Adrian crawls into bed and turns off the lights He closes
his eyes

ADRIAN
Not tonight

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY — ADRIAN’S DREAM

Adrian’s parents have a missing child command center set up
in the living room There are people scattered about
gathering up fliers and making phone calls The place is

bustling with do-gooders trying to find Adrian

Adrian’s DAD is on the phone talking He hangs it up and
walks away from it

DAD
Has anyone seen my wife

He gets a lot of no’s and negative head shakes before he
walks out of the living room

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian’s Dad looks around and then to the police officer
standing by the front door

DAD
Have you seen my wife

The officer shakes his head no

Adrian’s Dad takes a quick look into the dining room but
he sees nothing so he ascends the stairs

UPSTAIRS

Adrian’s Dad pokes his head into the master bedroom but he
sees nothing and closes the door

He knocks on the bathroom door

DAD
Honey are you in there

There is no response so he opens the door
BATHROOM

The bathroom door opens and Adrian’s Dad walks in His
face quickly goes pale as his eyes widen in horror

We see blood in a pool on the floor The pool has a trail
leading up to and into the bathtub where we see Adrian’s
Mom lying naked in blood red water Her wrists are slit
and we see a razor lying on the edge of the tub

Adrian’s Dad hurries to the tub and he drops to his knees
He grabs his wife and pulls her from the tub

DAD
Help Somebody help me

He embraces his wife’s limp body tightly as tears begin to
pour from his eyes

DAD
Don’t do this to me I can’t do
this alone I can’t do this
alone

Her lifeless head all of the sudden turns towards him and
her eyes SPRING OPEN They are black holes Shock
overtakes him as her mouth widens and she SCREAMS

CUT TO

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian awakens violently in his bed He sits up while
breathing heavily and sweating

ADRIAN
I can’t take this anymore

Adrian stands up from his bed and he walks to his door

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
These dreams are torture

A gloved hand grabs Adrian’s shoulder as he swings around
to see a tall man standing in his room The man is wearing
a long white lab coat and a gas mask The eyes of the gas
mask are blacked out and it envelopes his entire head
There is nothing visible on this man He is completely
covered This is a MASKED MAN

MASKED MAN 1
You have yet to experience true
torture in this life

Adrian is overtaken by fright as the Masked Man sticks a
hypodermic needle into Adrian’s neck and he pumps him full
of drugs Adrian’s eyes quickly roll into the back of his
head as he drops to the floor

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

The early morning light shines through the window as Adrian
shoots up out of bed He looks around his room to see if
anybody is there Seeing nothing he quickly goes to the
mirror and looks at his neck searching for where he was
stuck by the needle His hands scurry all over his neck
but they come up empty

UPSTAIRS

Adrian slowly creeps from his room as he looks around for
anybody who may still be in his house He doesn’t see
anybody but he still creeps out of his room slowly He
walks over to the 2° floor office and looks inside but
sees no one He then goes to the other side and he pokes
his head into the bathroom the master bedroom and
Barton’s room but he finds nobody

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian descends the stairs and he double checks the locks
on the front door They appear secure as he pokes his head
into the living room and sees nobody

DINING ROOM

Adrian walks through the dining room to check in the
kitchen but he sees nobody

KITCHEN

Adrian grabs the phone and dials a number The phone rings
and we hear the BEEP of a voicemail

BARTON (OS)
Hey you’ve reached Barton Leave
me your name and number and I’11
get back to you as soon as I can

ADRIAN

(on the phone)
Barton your absence is becoming
problematic Thiswhatever this
is isn’t funny There are people
coming into the house I am in
desperate need of your assistance
Call me back

Adrian slams the phone down in frustration He turns
around and leans up against the counter as he begins to
frantically bite at his fingernails It is at this point
that he looks at his refrigerator and his face goes pale
The refrigerator is covered in crudely written 15’s from
top to bottom

drian turns to his sink and he grabs a sponge He wets
he sponge and goes to his fridge where he begins to
rantically scrub away at the numbers His arm furiously
orks the refrigerator over but to no avail The numbers
on’t come off so he turns back to the sink and slams the
ponge down into it in a fit of rage as he SCREAMS

Hee whet p
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - DAY

Adrian is sitting in a chair in the corner of the dining
room He is holding a baseball bat as he keeps watch
see the refrigerator in the kitchen is now covered with
sheet

The front door opens and Raziela enters the house She
steps into the dining room as Adrian jumps up

ADRIAN
There is no fucking way It is
not physically possible for you to
have entered through that door I
have checked that lock a dozen
times so far today There is no
fucking way

RAZIELA
Well good morning to you too

ADRIAN
I don’t need your shit So how
the fuck did you get in here

Raziela looks frightened by Adrian’s anger
RAZIELA
Hey I just turned the knob and
walked in If you don’t want me
here I’1ll1 leave
Raziela heads back to the door as Adrian rushes towards
ENTRANCEWAY
Adrian steps in front of the door to stop Raziela
ADRIAN
No wait II don’t want to be
alone right now
RAZIELA

Okay well if you want me to stay
I need you to calm down

We
a

it
Adrian closes his eyes and he exhales in an effort to calm
himself

ADRIAN
I’m sorry There have been a lot
of weird things going on A man
was in the house last night and he
drugged me

Raziela looks bewildered by the statement

RAZIELA
That seems like a bit much

ADRIAN
It seems odd but it’s true I’m
not crazy My brother thinks that
they’re just nightmares but I
know better I know the
difference between what’s real and
what isn’t

RAZIELA
Hell I believe you which is why
it’s odd that your own brother
wouldn’t Of course after all
this time that you and I have
spent talking I can’t believe you
didn’t tell me you had a brother

Adrian shakes his head in disbelief over the statement

ADRIAN
I’ve already dealt with an
overabundance of oddities today I
don’t need you playing mind games
with me as well

RAZIELA
What are you talking about

ADRIAN
You pretending like we didn’t talk
about my brother I told you the
story about when he pushed me
outside
RAZIELA
We’ve never talked about your
brother

ADRIAN

We talked about him yesterday
About the fact that he might be
drugging me with my medication

Raziela shoots Adrian a smirk of disbelief

RAZIELA
Listen I want to believe that
you’re not really losing it but
that is going to be hard to do if
you can’t keep facts straight

Adrian begins to get frustrated

ADRIAN
I have my facts straight We had
a whole conversation about him

Adrian looks almost lost He doesn’t know how to
his sanity

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
The first day you came into my
house you picked up the photo in
the living room with my parents
Barton and me You’ve seen the
photo

Adrian walks into the living room and Raziela fol
behind him

LIVING ROOM

Adrian grabs the picture frame that contains the photo and

he hands it to Raziela She looks down at it as
to it without looking himself

ADRIAN
See There we are

Raziela looks concerned

explain

lows

he points

RAZIELA
Did you look at this

Adrian seems confused by that question

ADRIAN
I look at that photo every day

RAZIELA
So then you know that it’s a photo
of you and your parents

Adrian again seems confused

ADRIAN
Of course

RAZIELA
And no brother

Adrian looks distraught as the color leaves his face
Raziela turns the picture around to show Adrian He looks
down at the photo and he sees his parents and himself at
the age of 10 Barton is now absent from the photo
Adrian looks almost frightened as he snatches the photo
from Raziela

ADRIAN
That’s not probable I’ve looked
at this photo a thousand times a
day It was the one last moment
of contentment before my life
malformed into shit and my
brother was with me in it He was
there

Adrian runs out of the living room still holding the photo
ENTRANCEWAY
Adrian runs up the stairs

UPSTAIRS

Adrian runs for the door to Barton’s room He opens the
door and reveals to himself that the room is filled with
boxes It is merely a storeroom not a bedroom

Adrian looks devastated as he closes the door to the room
He holds it shut for a moment and then he reopens it to
take another look as though it was merely a trick his eyes
were playing but the room is still full of boxes Adrian
shuts the door again

ENTRANCEWAY

Raziela stands at the bottom of the stairs looking up as
Adrian looking like a hollow shell of himself walks down
the stairs

RAZIELA
Are you going to be okay

Adrian doesn’t respond as he walks past her and goes into
the living room

LIVING ROOM

Adrian drops down and sits on the couch still clutching the
photo in his hand

ADRIAN
The man who was here last
nighthe must have swapped out
the photo

Raziela drops to her knees in front of Adrian and she
places her hands on his to comfort him

RAZIELA
That may be so but it doesn’t
explain why I don’t remember him
or any conversation we may or may
not have had about him

A light bulb goes off in Adrian’s head

ADRIAN
I’11 call him

Adrian slides to the other side of the couch and he picks
up the phone that’s there He dials the number for Barton
The phone rings and we hear a CLICK before an automated
voice

AUTOMATED VOICE (OS)
Your call could not be completed
as dialed Please hang up and try
again

Adrian’s face is stiff with shock He hangs up and redials
the number Again we hear a CLICK before an automated
voice

AUTOMATED VOICE (OS)
Your call could not be completed
as dialed Please hang up and try
again

Adrian puts the phone down as he sinks into the couch and
he clutches the photo to his chest Raziela sits down next
to him and she holds his hand as she snuggles up to him

ADRIAN
I’m not crazy I’m not

LIVING ROOM — A SHORT TIME LATER
Adrian is sitting on the couch still holding the photo of
his family close to his chest Raziela enters from the

entranceway

RAZIELA
Why is your fridge covered

Adrian doesn’t even turn to look at her
ADRIAN

Somebodysome sad excuse for a
human being defiled it

RAZIELA
Well I’m kind of hungry so can we
maybe uncover it

Adrian puts the photo down as he gets up and steps to
Raziela
ADRIAN
No we can’t consume one iota of
what remains in that refrigerator
They defiled it for a purpose
(MORE)
Raziela sort

Adrian grabs

Adrian snaps

Adrian walks
ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian stops
Raziela

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
It was a sign An indication of
their intentions Even if I
wanted to open that fridge its
contents are most likely tainted
There is no way that food is safe
for consumption

of smirks and nods the comment off

RAZIELA
Okay but that doesn’t change the
fact that I’m hungry and I’m going
to need some food

her by the shoulders

ADRIAN
The fridge is off limits

his fingers as an idea comes to him

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
We can eat whatever is in the
cabinets

out into the entranceway and Raziela follows

just short of the dining room and he turns to

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
Or we don’t eat what’s in the
cabinets because that’s what they
expect us to do They knew that
if they put the whammy on the
fridge the only recourse is the
cabinets but I’m not that
foolish I won’t be eating
anything that’s in this house

RAZIELA
Your reasoning is fine but I’m
still hungry
ADRIAN
I’m sorry but there’s just no
eating anything that’s in this
house

RAZIELA
Okay

Raziela heads towards the front door and Adrian looks
saddened by it

ADRIAN
Where are you going

RAZIELA
Well if I can’t eat anything that
is already in this house I will
need to obtain food from outside
of it

ADRIAN
Please don’t disappear with my
sense of calm

Raziela steps back over to Adrian and she places a hand on
his shoulder to comfort him

RAZIELA
I’m just going to go over to my
house and grab us some food I’11
be back in a few minutes

ADRIAN
Do you think that’s a good idea

RAZIELA
We both need to eat and this is
the easiest way

ADRIAN
I don’t think that I should be
alone

RAZIELA

And you won’t be
(MORE)

RAZIELA (CONT’D)
I’ve already called out of work
tonight so I won’t be going
anywhere I’m merely going to get
food and then come right back
Ten minutes tops

ADRIAN
Okay

Raziela goes to the front door

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
Please be quick

RAZIELA
I’1l be hell-a fast

Raziela exits the house leaving Adrian alone Adrian
quickly picks up his baseball bat and enters the dining
room

DINING ROOM

Adrian sits down in his chair in the corner wielding the
baseball bat He stays ever vigilant

A moment later there is a KNOCK at the door

ADRIAN
That was fast

Adrian stands up but then it dawns on him

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
Razi never knocks

Adrian grips the bat as he steps into the entranceway
ENTRANCEWAY

The front door opens and Dr Mountebank enters the house
holding a key

Adrian looks relieved
DR MOUNTEBANK
Hey I didn’t mean to startle you

The doctor points to the baseball bat

DR MOUNTEBANK (CONT’D)
Feel free to put the bat down

Adrian looks at the bat in his hand as he loosens up his
grip and leans the bat against the wall

ADRIAN
I’m sorry Doctor Mountebank I
thought you were something else

DR MOUNTEBANK
What do you mean “something”

ADRIAN
SomeoneSomethingit’s alla
blur

Adrian goes over and sits on the steps

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
I can’t tell reality from the
delusions my mind is making up

Dr Mountebank walks over to Adrian

DR MOUNTEBANK
That’s why I’m here Voice your
troubles and I can help

ADRIAN
Do you remember my brother

DR MOUNTEBANK
Of course I do You talk about
him all the time

Adrian perks up at the comment as he gets to his feet

ADRIAN
I knew I wasn’t crazy What’s
going on Doc Do you know where
he is

Dr Mountebank looks disappointed

DR MOUNTEBANK
I thought we were past this I
know your brother because you talk
about him all the time but that
doesn’t mean he’s real He is one
of the manifestations of your
mind A delusion brought on by
the years of seclusion you have
forced yourself to endure

All the hope that was is Adrian’s face is ripped away from
him in a mere instance

ADRIAN
No He’s real I’ve talked with
him I’ve seen him He’s the one
who rearranged my house

The doctor looks into the living room at how it’s been
cleaned up

DR MOUNTEBANK
Adrian I think it’s great how
youve cleaned up but you did
that You cleaned the house
because I told you it was a good
idea It was meant to help you
feel better about your
surroundings You’re using your
“brother” to try and resist the
change that is taking place here

Adrian turns away from the doctor in disgust as he walks
back into the dining room

DINING ROOM
Dr Mountebank follows Adrian into the room
ADRIAN

I don’t want to hear these lies
anymore
DR MOUNTEBANK
Adrian I thought we were past
this but if you can’t distinguish
what is real I’m afraid you may
not be fit to live on your own

Adrian becomes angry and turns to the doctor with a furious

look on his face

ADRIAN
I am fit to live on my own You
will not tear me away from this
house My mind is fine I don’t
need you

DR MOUNTEBANK
There is no need for the
hostility I only want what’s
right for you

Adrian points to the door
ADRIAN
If you’re not going to help then
get out You’re useless and you

only seek to further my torture

Adrian walks back into the entranceway and the doctor
follows behind him

ENTRANCEWAY
Adrian grabs the baseball bat again

DR MOUNTEBANK
Let’s talk about this

ADRIAN
I want you to leave

Adrian points the baseball bat directly into the doctor’s

face which causes the doctor to become perturbed

DR MOUNTEBANK
I am the wrong person to threaten

ADRIAN
You’re the right one at the
moment

Dr Mountebank reaches up and places his index finger on
the tip of the baseball bat The bat instantly turns to
ash in Adrian’s hand and it crumbles and falls to the
ground

Adrian is in shock as he looks at the ash fragments that
still linger on his hands

DR MOUNTEBANK
I am not to be trifled with

The doctor heads to the front door
DR MOUNTEBANK (CONT’D)

When this is all said and done

just remember that you brought it

on yourself
The doctor exits the house
Adrian opens his hand and he looks at the ash in his palm
and along his fingers He looks down at the pile of ash on

the floor and he is baffled by what he sees

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT — ADRIAN’S DREAM

The room is covered with missing child posters with
Adrian’s face on them The missing child command center is
empty and quiet

Adrian’s Dad is sitting in a chair in the living room with
the lights out He reaches down next to his chair and
grabs a bottle of liquor He takes a quick swig and then
wipes his mouth There’s a photo of Adrian’s Mom sitting
in his lap that he is staring down at

DAD
My familyWhy GodWhy

He takes another swig from the bottle of liquor

DAD (CONT’ D)
I’1l tell you why There is no
God What kind of God would allow
an innocent child to be taken To
be ripped from his family

Adrian’s Dad gets up from the chair and it’s at this point
that we see a pistol stuffed into the back of his pants
He looks at one of the missing posters on the wall before
turning and dropping to his knees

DAD (CONT’ D)
Then if that wasn’t enough

He holds the picture of his wife to the sky

DAD (CONT’D)
You took my wife She couldn’t
handle the guiltthe pain of
losing our son Why Why Have
I not been a good man Have I not
lived my life in your eyes I did
everything right I loved you
Why couldn’t you love me

We see a hand reach out and touch his shoulder It appears
as though he doesn’t notice the hand on his shoulder

After a moment the hand is taken away but we never see
who placed it there

Adrian’s Dad pulls out the gun he tucked into his pants and
he kisses the photo of his wife

DAD (CONT’D)
I’11 see you soon

He places the gun to his temple and BAM A flash of light
illuminates the room as the gun fires into his head We
see his blood spray out and douse some of the posters of
Adrian on the wall as well as the photo of his wife His
body drops to the floor limp and lifeless The room falls
silent

We hear the front door open and the sound of a few small
footsteps walking into the living room It is revealed

that the footsteps belong to a 10 year old Adrian who is
now standing in the living room He is covered in blood

His face and clothes all appear to have been doused In
his hand he’s holding a black belt The belt is wrapped
around his hand and the metal buckle is clutched between
his fingers The metal prong of the buckle is sticking out
between his fingers and there is blood dripping from the
belt buckle

Adrian walks into the room and he sees his father’s brains
splattered against the wall His face is a stone as he
drops to his knees by his father’s side

Over Adrian’s shoulder we see a man standing by the front
door of the house This man is the 26 year old version of
Barton He is simply standing and watching Adrian sit next
to his father

CUT TO
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian wakes up in his bed breathing hard and coming to the
realization that it was a dream His hectic breathing
begins to subside as he kicks the covers off himself At
this point four pairs of gloved hands reach out and grab
his arms and legs Each pair of hands help to pin Adrian
to the bed He begins to look and he sees four Masked Men
holding him down to his bed while he thrashes to try and
get loose Another Masked Man walks up to the foot of his
bed and stares him down

MASKED MAN 1
Have you been enjoying yourself

ADRIAN
What do you want from me I don’t
have anything

The Masked Man holding down his left arm speaks up

MASKED MAN 2
It’s not about what we want

The Masked Man holding down his right arm speaks up

MASKED MAN 3
It’s about what you need

ADRIAN
I don’t need this
this

I don’t need

MASKED MAN 1
That is not for you to decide

Masked Man 1 walks around the bed and he pulls out a large
knife He cuts open Adrian’s shirt

ADRIAN
Please don’t
MASKED MAN 1
There is no stopping this
is what you deserve

This
ADRIAN
I haven’t done anything wrong

MASKED MAN 1
Are you sure about that

Masked Man 1 slides the blade along Adrian’s belly letting
the cold steal just ever so gently scratch him

ADRIAN
Please

MAS
And thank you

MAS

ED MAN 2

ED MAN 3

You’ re welcome

Masked Man 1 takes his larg
into Adrian He cuts along
pain Blood flies as Masked
We see blood spurt up onto t

Masked Man 1 finishes cutti
holds up the large flap of s
him We see the skin drip b
where it once rested

Masked Men as Adrian’s SCREAI

e knife and he begins to cut
his belly as Adrian SCREAMS in
Man 1 flays Adrian’s abdomen
he gas masks of the other

MS grow louder

ng into Adrian’s belly and he
kin that was once attached to
lood down onto Adrian’s stomach

MASKED MAN 1
Your pound of flesh

Masked Man 1 throws the skin at the wall and then proceeds
to clean off the blade of his knife He sets the tip of
the blade on Adrian’s chest

MASKED MAN 1 (CONT’D)
Is a pound really enough though
I’m thinking we take “fifteen”

ADRIAN
Stop Stop

Masked Man 1 begins to cut into Adrian’s chest Adrian
SCREAMS in pain as all of the masked men disappear

Adrian’s arms and legs are free as his body continues to
jerk about He looks down and he sees the beautiful naked
Raziela sitting on his crotch thrusting away in the throes
of passion He is in such pain but he can’t keep his eyes
or his hands off of her beautiful body as it goes about
pleasing him

Raziela raises her right hand up to show that she is
holding the large knife that was wielded by Masked Man 1
Her left hand goes below her waist and it comes back up
covered in blood Her bloody hand caresses her stomach and
breasts as she paints herself red Her left hand again
goes below her waist but this time Adrian looks and he
sees her hand reach into his gapping stomach wound Her
hand gets covered in more blood as Adrian is shocked at the
sight Raziela again rubs her hand all over her body to
paint herself in blood This time she puts her left hand
up to her mouth and begins to lick the blood off of her
fingers As she licks her fingers she takes her right
hand and places the knife on Adrian’s chest Adrian stares
the blade down as his eyes go up Raziela’s arm and he takes
one last look at her beautiful blood covered face Raziela
pulls the knife back before she violently shoves the blade
forward into the base of Adrian’s jaw The blade slides up
through Adrian’s mouth and through his skull Adrian’s
body violently twitches as he goes limp and Raziela takes
one last thrust as she climaxes

CUT TO

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian is lying in his bed as he awakens SCREAMING His
hands frantically pat around his stomach searching for the
wound he believes he just received He finds no wound and
he leaps out of bed He opens his door and steps out into
the upstairs

UPSTAIRS

Adrian can hear the sound of the TV as he looks downstairs
He can see the light of the TV flickering from the living
room He ever so slowly begins to creep down the steps
towards the living room

LIVING ROOM

Adrian steps into the room and he sees Raziela sitting on
the couch watching “Constantine” on TV She sees him enter
and she turns down the volume of the TV We see the volume
stop on 15

RAZIELA
Hey I didn’t expect to see you up
and about

Adrian storms over to her and he snatches the remote from
her hand He turns the TV off and throws the remote
against the wall causing it to smash into pieces

RAZIELA
That seems like a bit much

ADRIAN
You’re a part of this You’re a
cog in the machine that keeps
fucking with me

RAZIELA
What the hell are you talking
about

ADRIAN

I know it wasn’t a dream I
wasn’t dreaming I felt every
last ounce of pain

(MORE)
Raziela stands

Raziela cracks

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
I felt the knife cut into my
flesh I felt them peel it off
It wasn’t a dream

up and inches towards Adrian

RAZIELA
I don’t understand

ADRIAN
I felt your hands dig into the
wound in my abdomen I felt the
entirety of what you did You
killed me

a bit of a smile

RAZIELA
I killed you

She puts her hand on his chest and he slaps it away

RAZIELA (CONT’D)
You seem pretty alive to me

ADRIAN
I felt it

RAZIELA
Are you sure you weren’t dreaming
because that’s where I found you
when I got back

ADRIAN
What are you talking about

RAZIELA
When I came back with the food you
weren’t down here I found you up
in your bed sleeping I figured
you had a tough day and you just
needed a little rest

ADRIAN
I didn’t go to bed
(MORE)

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
I don’t remember going to bed I
was down here and then I was
upstairs being tortured

Adrian turns away from Raziela and he exits the room
Raziela follows behind him

ENTRANCEWAY
Adrian sits on the stairs and Raziela stops next to him

RAZIELA
I’ve been here the whole time
You haven’t been tortured You’re
snoring now that was torture

Adrian looks infuriated

ADRIAN
I experienced real agony and
suffering

RAZIELA
I think maybe we should call
somebody Maybe find some help
for your “dreams”

Adrian points to the door

ADRIAN
If you don’t believe me you can
get out of my house

RAZIELA
I want to believe you but I think
maybe you could use some help
Maybe you’ve been alone to long

ADRIAN
I’ve never been alone It’s been
me and my brother for as long as I
can remember

RAZIELA
The brother that doesn’t exist

Adrian stands up and points to the door

ADRIAN
Get out I want you out

RAZIELA
Adrian I can help you You
shouldn’t be alone

ADRIAN
Apparently I’ve been in solitude
for some time and everything is
just fine So fuck off

Raziela goes to the door

RAZIELA
You’re not going to do any better
without me

ADRIAN
Though it seems a worthy endeavor

Raziela exits the house leaving Adrian alone He goes back
and sits down on the steps where he slumps down to brood
over the events that have just transpired

A few moments pass and he perks up like something has
caught his attention The sound of CRYING grows louder and
LOUDER Adrian looks around searching for the sound He
stands up as the sound of CRYING gets even LOUDER and it
grows more distinct as that of a young boy

Adrian pokes his head into the dining room but he sees
nothing He then goes and looks into the living room but
again he sees nothing

The BOOM of THUNDER is heard as Adrian looks to the window
and sees rain starting to pelt the glass A FLASH of
LIGHTNING illuminates the room as THUNDER once again BOOMS

He continues to hear the CRYING as he focuses on the
basement door Adrian creeps towards the basement door as
he looks down at the numeric lock Adrian slowly moves his
hand towards the lock but he pulls it back unable to push
the buttons He leans in close to the door and places his
ear to it He hears the CRYING grow even LOUDER It’s

then that he hears footsteps quickly run up the stairs He
pulls his head back from the door as something SLAMS
against it Adrian steps back from the door and stands
looking shocked as the door continues to get SLAMMED
against The SLAMS get harder and harder as it looks like
the door might fly off the hinges and then without warning
the slams stop Adrian looks petrified as he creeps away
from the basement door

LIVING ROOM

Adrian creeps his way into the living room which is
completely dark There is a LOUD BOOM of THUNDER followed
by LIGHTNING that illuminates the room The lightning
allows Adrian to see the corpse of his father lying dead on
the floor Once the flash of lightning is gone the corpse
disappears on the darkness

Adrian is in shock His eyes are deceiving him as the
LIGHTNING CRASHES once again to illuminate the room
revealing that the corpse of his father is no longer on the
floor Adrian looks relieved as we see his father now
standing next to him Adrian doesn’t see his father
standing there

His father’s face is covered in blood with a gaping hole in
his head where the bullet exited his skull The wound is
dripping down onto his shoulder

DAD
Adrian

His dad reaches out and places his hand on Adrian’s
shoulder as Adrian turns in response to his name Adrian
sees his father as his eyes widen in horror Adrian jumps
away from his dad as he steps backwards out of the living
room

ADRIAN

You’re not real You’re not
fucking real

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian steps backwards towards the stairs as his father’s
lumbering corpse walks towards him

DAD
Don’t you see son We can
finally be together We will
never be torn apart again

ADRIAN
You killed yourself You’re not
here

Adrian’s back hits the bottom railing of the stairs as his
father creeps closer

DAD
Don’t walk away from me Adrian
Come give your dad a hug

Adrian closes his eyes

ADRIAN
This is all in my head This is
all in my head

Adrian opens his eyes to see that his father is merely
inches from his face Adrian screams as he pushes his dad
back

DAD
Is that any way to treat your
father

ADRIAN

You’re not my father

Just then a hand places itself on Adrian’s shoulder We
see that the wrist is slit open as Adrian turns around to
see his mother standing on the stairs

Adrian’s mom is naked and dripping wet as though she just
got out of the tub Her eyes are black as night and her
skin is a pale white She holds her arms out showing her
slit wrists as she seems to want to embrace Adrian

Adrian SCREAMS as she steps down towards him

MOM
Don’t be frightened It’s me
It’s mommy Come give your mother
a hug

Adrian runs into the dining room
DINING ROOM

ADRIAN
You’re not my parents My parents
are dead

We see his parents now standing together walking towards
him

MOM
Do we look dead

They stop in their tracks as his father embraces his
mother Adrian looks appalled as he sees his parents begin
to kiss It is a passionate and lasting kiss of two lovers
who would never want to be torn apart but it is tarnished
by their current state The kiss ends but they continue
to embrace

DAD
Don’t look so shocked Our love
is an eternal one

A quick FLASH of LIGHTNING blinds Adrian He winces and
his parents are now merely inches from his face

MOM
Look at us

DAD
One big happy family

Adrian blacks out and drop to the floor
INT DR MOUNTEBANK’S OFFICE — DAY

Dr Mountebank is sitting behind his desk and he looks to
the person on the other side

DR MOUNTEBANK
I take it things are going well as
he was rather frantic from my
little visit

We now see that he is looking at Barton

BARTON
Things are really progressing He
doesn’t know up from down at this
point

DR MOUNTEBANK
Good Then help him finish it so
he can start fresh

BARTON
My thoughts exactly

INT BASEMENT — NIGHT — ADRIAN’S DREAM

A ten year old Adrian is sitting in the corner of the dark
basement He is CRYING as we see the large shadowed man
walking down the stairs

We finally see the face of the shadowed man He is a clean
cut man in his 40’s He is wearing a business suit and he
looks like he just got off work This is TRAVIS CONWAY
Adrian curls up into a ball pulling all his limbs into his
chest in an effort to make himself disappear Travis
simply looks at Adrian and smiles as he grabs Adrian by the
arm and pulls him to the other side of the room We see
them stop at a plain wooden table in the corner of the
room Travis pushes Adrian against the wall and leaves him
there

Travis steps back from Adrian He takes off his jacket and
lies it down on the table in an effort to keep it nicely
folded

TRAVIS
So how’s my little man today

He undoes his tie and he lays it down neatly on top of his
jacket

Adrian remains silent as he looks devastated at the sight
of Travis

TRAVIS (CONT’D)
Did you miss me while I was gone

He unbuttons his shirt and then takes it off He folds the
shirt to leave it nice and neat before he sets it on the
table next to his jacket and tie

Tears stream down Adrian’s face as terror grips him

TRAVIS (CONT’D)
You don’t have to worry I’m here
now You know you never have to
worry when I’m around

Travis undoes his belt and he pulls it from his belt loops
He sets the belt down near his jacket

Adrian looks at the belt and his eyes almost reach out and
grab it

TRAVIS (CONT’D)
Since you’ve been such a good boy
I wanted to give you a treat Are
you ready for your treat

Travis begins to unzip his pants as Adrian snaps Adrian
leaps forward and punches Travis in the crotch Travis

drops to his knees and grabs his crotch in pain as Adrian
snatches the belt from the table He quickly whips Travis
in the face with the belt which knocks him backwards onto
the ground

TRAVIS
Adrian why would you hurt me like
that I’ve always been good to
you

Adrian quickly wraps the belt around his hand and he puts
the belt buckle in his hand He puts the prong of the
buckle between his fingers and he lunges it forward Travis
catches Adrian and he holds his arms to keep Adrian from
moving Adrian knees Travis in the crotch which grants
his arms freedom Adrian then JAMS the prong into Travis’

eye and Travis pushes Adrian away as he writhes on the
ground holding his eye

TRAVIS
My fucking eye You little shit

Adrian jumps onto Travis and he begins to RAPIDLY STAB at
Travis’ face and neck We see the prong of the belt stab
into Travis’ neck where the jugular vein is and then get
pulled out allowing blood to spurt forth We then see the
prong get stabbed into Travis’ hand that is covering his
eye Travis moves his hand from his eye as Adrian
continues to FURIOUSLY STAB at him We see the prong of
the belt brutally penetrate Travis’ face and neck He is
getting what he deserves as blood flies out of every single
wound that Adrian inflicts We see Adrian get covered ina
cleansing shower of blood His face is furious but his
actions are just Adrian JAMS the prong of the belt into
Travis’ mouth and knocks out a few of his teeth which
causes Travis to cough up blood all over his face Travis
coughs up blood as his body goes limp and Adrian continues
to STAB at what is now a corpse

CUT TO
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian comes to sitting in the chair he has stationed in
the corner of the dining room He is disoriented and
unsure of everything he has experienced He is holding his
baseball bat but looks baffled at the site of it as he
remembers it turning to ash in his hand He throws the bat
down and gets up out of the chair

RAZIELA (OS)
Adrian

Adrian looks into the entranceway and he sees Masked Man 1
holding a knife to Raziela’s neck

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian steps into the room as Masked Man 1 backs himself
towards the basement door

RAZIELA
Adrian help me

ADRIAN
Why would I help you For all I
know this is another one of your
ploys to fuck with me

MASKED MAN 1
If only you knew

The Masked Man holds the blade tight to Raziela’s neck

RAZIELA

I told you that I’ve got nothing
to do with this I’m the only
person who really cares about you
Don’t let him do this to me

ADRIAN
Do what For all I know you’re
about to go the way of Barton
You’re probably not even real

RAZIELA
This isn’t about me trying to lie
to you I need help

ADRIAN
Youd be amazed at how little
faith I can put into my own two
eyes at this point

MASKED MAN 1
Pity

The Masked Man pushes the knife into Raziela’s neck and we
see blood begin to gush forth as he slides the blade across
her neck He pulls the blade back as Raziela grabs her
neck Blood oozes out from between her fingers as she
chokes on her own blood She drops to her knees and gives
Adrian one last look before she collapses to the floor
dead

Adrian’s eyes are wide in horror of what he sees as Masked
Man 1 goes to the basement door

ADRIAN
Razi
Adrian quickly drops down beside Raziela He lifts her
head into his lap as he tries to put his hand over her
wound to stop the bleeding

MASKED MAN 1
Do you believe your eyes now Is
this sufficient evidence

ADRIAN
Why did you do that

MASKED MAN 1
I’ve done nothing more than what
is needed I’m merely an
instrument

ADRIAN
An instrument of what

Masked Man 1 opens the door to the basement

MASKED MAN 1
The answers only come when it’s
all over and the fastest way to
resolution is to follow me

ADRIAN
Why am I supposed to bear this
pain and suffering

MASKED MAN 1
This pain and suffering that you
have endured is but a mere morsel
You ask why but I ask why not
Is this not appropriate Does it
not fit

Adrian has tears flowing down his face as he continues to
hold Raziela’s lifeless body

ADRIAN
Fit what Haven’t I been through
enough Both of my parents killed
themselves my brother isn’t real
I was kidnapped and defiled when I
was ten Haven’t I suffered
enough

MASKED MAN 1
That’s not for me to say as I’ve
already stated when you’ll get
your answers I am merely here to
push you in the right direction
What happens from here isn’t
within my control

Masked Man 1 walks through the door to the basement and it
closes behind him as you hear the numeric lock BEEP and
lock

Adrian continues to cry as he looks down at Raziela

ADRIAN
I’m sorry I’m sorry that I
didn’t believe you I condemned
you to this

At this moment Raziela’s arm reaches up and her hand
caresses the side of his face Her bloody hand leaves a
streak of red on his face

RAZIELA
I’m not the one who is condemned

Adrian freaks out and he scrambles away from Raziela’s
body He pushes himself to the corner as he stares at
Raziela’s corpse still lying at the center of the room He
stares at her as we see into the dining room which is just
off to Adrian’s left Raziela is standing in the dining
room with her throat slight Adrian doesn’t see her as he
continues to stare at the corpse

ADRIAN
You’re dead You’re dead

RAZIELA (0OS)
Am I

Adrian turns towards the dining room and he sees Raziela
standing there with her throat dripping blood He
scrambles to his feet and backs away from the dining room
He steps backwards and trips over the corpse of Raziela
that is lying in the middle of the floor He sits up and
sees her corpse as well as her standing just a few feet
from him He gets to his feet and backs himself to the

living room

LIVING ROOM

Adrian backs up to the couch as Raziela walks towards him
He sees her step over her own corpse as she comes to the
entrance of the living room

ADRIAN
You’re fucking dead

RAZIELA
So were your parents It didn’t
stop them from popping by

ADRIAN
They weren’t real and neither are
you

Raziela runs her hand through the blood on her neck and she
holds her bloody hand up to show him

RAZIELA
Is this not real Is this what
makes me less than you

ADRIAN
I watched you die

RAZIELA
Wasn’t it just a few short hours
ago that you told me of your own
demise at my hands Who’s to say
what state of life I’m in as your
judgment seems to be compromised

Adrian stands up and pushes Raziela away from him as he
SCREAMS in anger He walks to the wall and punches a hole

in it

ADRIAN
I still have my sanity I know
what’s real I know You’re
fucking dead That’s real
RAZIELA
Then how is it that you’re talking
to me Talking to the deceased
isn’t usually considered to be
“sane”

ADRIAN
Don’t screw with me I’m not
buying what you’re selling

RAZIELA
That’s fine as we weren’t looking
to sell it anymore

Adrian perks up at what she just said

Raziela smiles

Raziela begins

ADRIAN
Who’s we You said “we” What
did you mean Who’s we

uv

at him

RAZIELA
We are the ones that care about
what happens to you We are the
ones that wish to see things done
properly

ADRIAN
What the fuck does that mean

to fade away
RAZIELA

This house can only hide the truth
for so long

Raziela disappears leaving Adrian alone in the house

walks back out

ENTRANCEWAY

into the entranceway

Adrian walks in and sees Raziela’s lifeless body still
lying on the ground

Adrian then turns his attention to the front door
walks over to it

He

He

ADRIAN
Why let it hide the truth

Adrian turns towards the stairs and looks around the house

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
Is this what you wanted Me to
leave Because you got it I’m
gonna fuckin’ leave I can’t take
this shit anymore I’11
leaveI’11 leave

Adrian turns back to the door and he grabs the knob The
knob won’t turn Adrian’s frustration quickly turns to a
panic as he tries frantically to open the door but it
won’t budge

Adrian backs himself up and then he runs full speed at the
door and he throws himself into it He hits the door and

drops to the ground He grabs his shoulder in pain as he

sees the door still standing strong to block his exit

Adrian stands up and looks upstairs He sees that all the
doors to the rooms are closed

ADRIAN
If the truth is hidden then I’m
not going to let it hide

Adrian walks towards the dining room and kitchen
KITCHEN
Adrian walks into the room and he begins to open all the
drawers His hand frantically moves the items in each
drawer around as he tries to find something He finally
opens a drawer and sees what he’s after He reaches into

it and pulls out a screwdriver

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian walks to the stairs and he ascends them
UPSTAIRS

Adrian goes to the left and he stops at his parent’s room
He opens the door to the room and he uses the screwdriver

to start unscrewing the hinges of the door He quickly
undoes the hinges as the door falls loose He grabs the
door and places it against the wall outside of the room
He quickly goes to Barton’s room He opens the door and
quickly begins to undo the hinges to it as well

A SHORT TIME LATER

Adrian removes the door to the 2 floor office and he
places it against the wall outside of the room

We see that all the doors to the rooms upstairs have been
removed and placed against the wall outside the room

Adrian looks proud of the work he’s done as he puts the
screwdriver into his pocket He goes to the stairs and
descends them

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian hits the bottom of the stairs and he hears the loud
SLAM of a door coming from upstairs He quickly turns to
look upstairs as there are four more loud SLAMS in
succession Adrian looks at the upstairs and he sees all
the doors back in place on each room Each door has been
put back and they have been closed Adrian looks shocked
and baffled as he looks at each door He quickly heads
back upstairs

UPSTAIRS

Adrian goes up to the bathroom door and he tries the
doorknob but the door won’t budge He frantically tries
to open the door but all the effort he can muster doesn’t
seem to show a result

He looks to the door of his bedroom and then he runs to it
He begins to frantically try to open the door but the
result is the same as the last in that all the effort he
can muster won’t budge the door Adrian SLAMS his fist
against the door

ADRIAN
Fuck

He repeatedly SLAMS his hands against the door

ADRIAN
Fuck Fuck Fuck

ENTRANCEWAY

Adrian walks down the stairs He gets to the bottom and
steps towards the dining room He is about to enter the
dining room as the wall slides over the entrance causing
the opening of the dining room to disappear It happens so
suddenly that it causes Adrian to stumble backwards and
fall onto Raziela’s corpse He quickly scrambles back to
his feet

ADRIAN
What the fuck

Adrian goes to the wall that now blocks the way to his
dining room He hesitantly puts his hand on the new wall
He feels how solid it is before SLAMMING his fist against
it He pounds and pounds the wall but it doesn’t even
scuff

He seems to come to a realization as he reaches into his
pocket and pulls out the screwdriver he has He gets a
good grip on the screwdriver as he prepares to stab the
wall He stabs the wall with all his might and the metal
of the screwdriver bends but the wall is unharmed He
pulls it back and looks amazed that the wall would bend the
screwdriver

Adrian throws the screwdriver towards the living room and
just as it’s about to cross into the room the living room
wall closes up the same way that the dining room just did
The screwdriver hits the new wall and drops to the floor
next to Raziela’s corpse

The house has blocked off everything from Adrian except for
the basement and the front door

Adrian goes and sits on the steps He’s got nothing left
He puts his head between his legs as he begins to rock
himself back and forth

ADRIAN
I’m not crazy I’m not crazy
I’m not crazy I’m not crazy

INT DR MOUNTEBANK’S OFFICE -— NIGHT

Dr Mountebank sits behind his desk while Barton sits
across from him

BARTON
This one is almost finished

DR MOUNTEBANK
Good Put a nail in it and let’s
move on

Barton stands up to leave

BARTON
I couldn’t have done all this
without your support

DR MOUNTEBANK
Don’t sell yourself short It’s a
masterpiece All you need to do
is finish it

INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE -— NIGHT

Adrian is still sitting on the steps holding himself He
stands up and walks to the front door

ADRIAN
One last try

He tries the knob but it doesn’t turn The front door
still has him trapped

Adrian walks over to the basement door by stepping over
Raziela’s corpse

He puts his head against the door and he looks down at the
numeric lock He hesitantly brings his hand up to it and
he types the numbers in His body seems to suffer physical
pain as he types 15 into the numeric pad Once he’s done
you hear the door CLICK and unlock Adrian opens the door
and he looks down into the basement As he looks down the
stairs he counts the steps There are 15 steps leading
down into the abyss He hesitates but he knows there is
no other option Adrian starts down the stairs

BASEMENT

Adrian takes the steps to the basement ever so slowly He
creeps his way into the poorly lit room

This is the same basement from his dreams This is the
dirt floor pit of despair that he was held in as a child

Adrian walks over to the table in the corner where he
killed Travis He looks the table over as he hears the
door to the basement open He looks to the stairs

We see a beam of light coming from up the stairs A shadow
steps into the light and begins to walk down the stairs

We here every step as the man gets to the bottom of the
stairs and we see that it’s Masked Man 1

Adrian looks horrified

Masked Man 1 walks over to the table in the corner and he
pushes Adrian against the wall Masked Man 1 reaches up
and takes off his mask revealing himself to be Travis

Adrian’s fear grows even more as his eyes begin to well up
with tears

Travis removes the gloves he’s wearing and he lays them on
the table He then takes off the white lab coat he’s
wearing and lays it next to the gloves We now see that he
has his suit on underneath everything

TRAVIS
So how’s my little man today

He takes off his jacket and he lays it neatly on the table
He then begins to undo his tie

TRAVIS (CONT’D)
Did you miss me while I was gone

Travis lays his tie down neatly on top of his jacket He
then starts to unbutton his shirt before he takes it off
He folds the shirt to leave it nice and neat before he sets
it on the table next to his jacket and tie

Tears continue to stream down Adrian’s face
TRAVIS (CONT’D)
You don’t have to worry I’m here
now You know you never have to
worry when I’m around

Travis undoes his belt and he starts to take it out of the
loops but he stops

TRAVIS (CONT’D)
Maybe I should leave that this
time Wouldn’t want things to get
out of hand again

Adrian lunges towards Travis but Travis grabs Adrian by
the neck and lifts him off his feet with ease

TRAVIS
This won’t be like before

ADRIAN
I killed you once I can do it
again

Travis tightens his grip on Adrian’s neck as Adrian begins
to flail his limbs in an effort to hit Travis No matter
how hard he swings Travis doesn’t seem to be fazed
Travis begins to laugh

TRAVIS
There is no winning this time
You can’t overpower me

Travis throws Adrian across the basement and he lands with
a powerful THUD at the bottom of the basement steps

Adrian struggles to stand up

ADRIAN
You’re the world’s biggest piece
of shit You deserve every ounce
of pain and suffering that can
possibly be bestowed upon you If
I could do it all over again I
would torture you and cause you
the pain that you caused me
TRAVIS
You still don’t understand

Adrian runs up the stairs and he grabs the doorknob to try
and leave the basement Like so many times before the
door won’t open Adrian is trapped and now we see Travis
standing directly behind him on the steps

TRAVIS (CONT’D)
You can’t escape me This is
going to happen

Travis grabs Adrian and he throws him down the stairs
Adrian again lands at the bottom of the stairs with a THUD
Travis smiles as he sees Adrian writhing in pain on the
ground

ADRIAN
This isn’t real I killed you

Travis walks down the stairs and he stands over Adrian

TRAVIS
That’s right Travis is dead

Travis puts his foot on Adrian’s chest to keep him in
place

ADRIAN
I’m losing my mind

TRAVIS
Are you Or are you simply
starting to see things for what
they really are

Travis takes his foot off of Adrian As his foot is being
lifted we see it transform into a large hoof Adrian
looks up the length of Travis’ body and we see his body
transform into a large demon creature Travis grows to
almost eight feet tall with what looks like dark charred
and burnt skin His face has dark dead eyes with a
snarling mouth filled with fangs On top of his head he
has two large horns that protrude out of his skull His
horns almost scrape the ceiling of the basement This is
the DEMON
DEMON
Do you see

Adrian’s quivering face and tear filled eyes have never
shown such fear as we see in this moment Even with
everything he’s experienced this is the most terrifying
thing he’s ever laid eyes upon

ADRIAN
What are you

DEMON

I’m your reckoning It’s my duty
to round out all the pain and
suffering you so wish to avoid
The big man wants this finished
hence I am here to bring that wish
to fruition I am here to destroy
youor what little remains

Adrian is crying

ADRIAN
I’ve already been destroyed I’m
done I’m done I don’t deserve
this

DEMON
Are you sure about that

The Demon flips Adrian over onto his stomach We see
Adrian continue to cry as we hear his clothes rip We see
the Demon kneel down over Adrian

ADRIAN
This isn’t real This isn’t real
This isn’t real

The Demon leans into Adrian’s ear

DEMON
I assure youit is very real

Adrian’s eyes widen in terror as the Demon smiles
INT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — DAY

The door to the basement opens and we see Adrian limp out

into the entranceway His clothes are hanging off of him

in shambles He is barely covered Adrian is a shattered
remnant of the man we once knew His face looks like the

epitome of despair This is a destroyed man

Adrian limps towards where Raziela’s corpse was but it’s
gone now

Adrian walks to the front door but stops and looks to the
upstairs Upstairs he sees a masked man standing in front
of each of the doors for a total of five

ADRIAN
What more could you possibly do to
me

The door to Adrian’s bedroom opens and Raziela with her
throat slit and blood all over her walks out

RAZIELA
h you’d be surprised what we’re
capable of

fe)

Raziela walks behind the masked men and she runs her hand
along their shoulders as she passes each one of them

Adrian is trembling with tears in his eyes

ADRIAN
WhyWHY

Raziela stands at the top of the stairs She wraps her
arms around the masked man who is standing there and she
smiles as she looks down on Adrian

RAZIELA
Because you deserve it you filthy
piece of shit

The front door of the house opens on its own as a breeze of
fresh air rushes into the room

Adrian turns his back on Raziela as he begins to limp
towards the front of the house He gets to the doorway and
stands in it for a moment He feels the fresh air on his
face as he closes his eyes and enjoys it

RAZIELA
It’s not going to be any better
out there

ADRIAN
It has to be

Adrian steps outside the house
EXT ADRIAN’S HOUSE — CONTINUOUS

Adrian steps out of the house and he limps towards the
street He feels the warm sun on his face as he smells the
air This is the world he has been missing for the past 15
years

Barton is standing in the middle of the street with his
arms wide open for a hug

BARTON
Congratulations I knew you could
do it How does it feel to be out
of that house

Adrian is astonished at the sight of Barton as he limps
towards him

ADRIAN
Barton You’re here

BARTON
I’ve been here I never left I
kept an ever watchful eye on
everything that happened here

Adrian looks disgusted

ADRIAN
So you stood by and watched me go
through all that torture I have
experienced horrors that I can’t
even begin to describe Why would
you just let that happen

BARTON
This is my favorite part No
matter how many times we tread
this ground I can’t even begin to
describe the elation I feel while
at this stage of things

ADRIAN
What the fuck are you talking
about We’ve never done this
before

Barton smiles from ear to ear

BARTON
If only that were true This is
actually the fifteenth time we’ve
done this

ADRIAN
I don’t understand Fifteenth
time we’ve done what

BARTON
You still don’t see the whole
picture

ADRIAN

What did you do to me I know
from the extreme pain that I’m
currently in that this was all
real I wasn’t out of my mind or
on drugs It all really happened

Barton claps his hands

BARTON
Very good sir You would be
correct This is all real and I
hope hope hope you are in
considerable pain I relish in
the thought of your suffering

Adrian looks baffled
ADRIAN
After everything that I endured
when I was a kid why would any of
this be justifiable Why put me
through this

BARTON
Because that’s the whole reason
youre here Don’t you see
You’re being punished

Adrian looks confused

ADRIAN
For the love of God why

BARTON
Oh not God He wanted nothing to
do with you In his eyes you’re
an abomination

ADRIAN
What are you talking about This
is me Adrian Why would you say
such things to me I don’t
deserve this

Barton just smiles and laughs

BARTON
You’re right Adrian doesn’t
deserve this but you’re not
Adrian

Adrian looks horrified

BARTON (CONT’D)
Your name is Travis Conway

ADRIAN
Travis Conway was the man that
molested me when I was a child

BARTON
Yes you molested quite a few
children before Adrian killed you
(MORE)
BARTON (CONT’D)
Fifteen to be exact You raped
fifteen young boys before Adrian
found the strength to end your
reign of terror

ADRIAN
I’m Adrian

Adrian points to himself

ADRIAN (CONT’D)
Me I’m Adrian

BARTON
Yes you have been Adrian for some
time now It’s one of many treats

that I’ve cooked up for you
Adrian drops down to his knees

ADRIAN
Is this hell

BARTON
Yes

Adrian looks up and down the street It looks so peaceful
and calm

BARTON (CONT’D)

What You expected fire and
brimstone That’s what they feed
you in the realm of the living
but that’s not the actuality of
it Hell is unique to the person
I have a guy who used to set women
on fire while they slept and then
he would pleasure himself to their
screams He currently lives ina
world populated by women with
flamethrowers He is set on fire
hundreds of times a day and I love
the sound of his cries for help
that will never be answered

(MORE)

BARTON (CONT’D)
That’s the hell he has earned
himself An eternity of being set
on fire by those he felt it
necessary to harm

ADRIAN
But why Adrian

BARTON
Like I said you’ve been Adrian
for some time now This is one of
the many tortures I’ve concocted
for you You are living the
tortured lives of those you hurt
You will be raped and
psychologically tortured for
eternity Before this you were
Brett Keeler He was so
traumatized by what you did that
he suffered violent night terrors
They became so severe that he
chose to take his own life I let
you experience his dreams with the
added bonus of the physical pain
that came from him reliving the
interactions he had with you I
truly loved it when you killed
yourself as Brett and didn’t die
That was an amazing moment You
fired the gun and the bullet tore
through your skull You gave the
wall a new coat of red paint It
was beautiful how you let the
blood roll down your face as shock
took hold of you You felt the
hole in your head and looked so
baffled by it It was one of my
favorites

ADRIAN
Did all this happen to Adrian

BARTON

Much of it but I spiced it up
with my own sick sense of humor
(MORE)

QUICK FLASHES

BARTON (CONT’D)
I started small with a few bumps
in the night and then I let things
get really interesting Took
myself out of the mix torture
dreams Raziela’s death bringing
your parents back They were all
things based from Adrian’s real
life but with my hands in the
mix Adrian’s parents did kill
themselves Once he got away from
you he was truly alone He
really did suffer from
agoraphobia which led to him not
leaving his house for 15 years
His story has a bit of a happy
ending though

— ADRIAN’S HAPPY ENDING

-- Adrian meets Raziela for the first time when she stops
by his house to say hello

-- Raziela kisses Adrian while they sit on the couch

-- Raziela stands outside the front door of the house and
she coaxes Adrian out the door into the sunlight

-- Adrian and
wedding

-- Adrian and
barbeque with

BACK TO SCENE

Barton stands

Raziela get married at a beautiful outdoor

Raziela are having a beautiful backyard
their two young children running and playing

over Adrian who remains horrified and

kneeling in the street We now see Adrian for who he truly

is Travis

BARTON
Adrian truly did get what he
deserved He got a beautiful
wife amazing kids and a long
happy life Adrian died a very
happy man
TRAVIS
He’s deadHow long have I been
here

BARTON
We don’t really measure time here
in the sense that you’re used to
as an eternity is just so long
but if it makes you feel better
youve been here for a mere 75
years

Travis looks devastated

TRAVIS
Seventy five years

Barton can’t hide his joy as he smiles again

BARTON
This is why I love this part so
much You get to experience the
pain of realization all over
again I love seeing the
devastation on your face as you
realize that you have been
eternally damned Knowing that
there is no escape from your
endless torture it’s truly
satiating for me Especially
given that you are in the infancy
of your damnation

TRAVIS
What now Who’s next

BARTON
You get to go back to the start
You get to live as your first
victim Patrick Larchuk and this
whole cycle gets to start again

Travis sits and thinks hard about all he’s heard

TRAVIS
I deserve this
Barton walks over to Travis and he puts his hand on his
shoulder

BARTON
Yes you do

We see Travis transform into a young 10 year old boy as the
setting changes to a playground

EXT PLAYGROUND — DAY (CONTINUOUS)

We see a playground full of children scurrying about and
having fun on all the equipment

We see the young 10 year old boy that Travis was just
transformed into This is Patrick Larchuk his first
victim We watch as an adult version of Travis lures him
over to his van

Barton and Dr Mountebank are standing off to the side
watching Travis and the boy

DR MOUNTEBANK
I have a great adoration for what
youve done here It’s one of the
many masterpieces I’ve seen within
my realm

BARTON
I’m merely fulfilling your wishes

DR MOUNTEBANK

Don’t sell yourself short You’re
an artist and your rise through my
ranks has been assured

BARTON
You have my gratitude

Dr Mountebank pats Barton on the back as they look on and
we see Travis take young Patrick into his van After a
moment the van pulls away

We see a woman begin to frantically search the playground
This is PATRICK’S MOM searching for him
PATRICK’S MOM
Patrick Patrick

Dr Mountebank and Barton smile with approval as she
frantically looks for her child

FADE OUT
