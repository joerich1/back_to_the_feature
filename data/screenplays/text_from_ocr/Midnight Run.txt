Ghead

The Duke disappears inside Walsh studies the lonely landscape
of old cars and shacks In their native language a few

INDIANS sitting nearby are having a good laugh at the expense
of Walshs bedraggled appearance Walsh does his best to
ignore them The sound of a large engine coming to life fills
the air Walsh pacing along the porch casually glances in

the direction of the crop duster as it slowly starts to taxi

away His eyes widen as he realizes that the man in the open
cockpit is the Duke It appears that the Duke is not afraid

of flying The prop spins with life The SOUND of the crop
duster intensifies Walsh cant believe how badly hes been
taken As the crop duster moves away Walsh goes berserk

WALSH
Fear of flying you son of a bitch

Walsh runs after the plane sprinting the length of the
reservation to catch up with the taxiing plane The Duke
swings it around for takeoff now moving toward Walsh As it
moves past him Walsh grabs onto the wing and hoists himself
alongside the cockpit The plane ROARS with life He reaches
for the Duke The Duke tries to push Walsh off and maintain
control at the same time

WALSH
Fear of flying my ass Get out of
that plane you son of a bitch

to reexamining who you are as a human
being

Walsh grabs the Duke halfway out of the cockpit The plane
zig-zags wildly through the field

THE DUKE
Youre going to get us killed

WALSH

Walsh right-hooks the Duke knocking him out then manages
to yank him from the cockpit They both fall to the ground
The pilotless crop duster aimlessly taxis in circles Indians
come running from every direction Walsh shoves the Duke
back toward the general store Indians surround them angrily
