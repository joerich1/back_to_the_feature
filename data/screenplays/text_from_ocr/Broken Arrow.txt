You dont have to worry about
Major Hale Hes probably hiding
behind a rock somewhere praying
I dont find him

Someone else might find him

All I can do is my part Weve
got the weapons were

meant Hale made the plane crash

Why would he do that

Two nuclear weapons would be worth
a hell of a lot of money

To whom Son there are easier
ways for someone to buy nuclear
weapons You go to one of the old
Soviet republics you can get one
for the price of a BMW

I meant theyd be worth a lot of
money to us How much would we
pay to get them back To make

sure they werent used in this
