business

DONNA
That just gave me goose bumps

Phoebe rolls her eyes Claire pretends she wasnt listening

AXLE

means

AXLE
Apparently not

TROY

bigger Now its the size of a baseball

He moves two inches up taps it in gently Somehow the nail
stays He covers the hole with the painting

A beat as Axle admires his handy work The chair tips He
falls Axle gracefully avoids the tank but knocks an entire
container of fish food into the water

He races to retrieve the container of food before the fish
eat themselves to death He plunges his entire arm into the

Axle sits with this Truer words have never been spoken

(F2ZZ2Z2Z22Z) A stream of COLD WATER smacks Axle in the nose
The boy drops his SUPER SOAKER water gun and tears off

Axle picks up the soaker and gives chase ducking under a
swing climbing up the slide laughing the whole way The boy
leads him into a nest of OTHER KIDS all with super soakers

The kids fire their weapons Axle reverses his field The
whole playground is now chasing him He slips the kids
pile on Tickle torturing One by one he overpowers and peels
them off Everyone laughing hysterically

Out of breath he sits up coming face to face with a Spanish-
speaking NANNY who lets out an inaudible yelpscream as she
sprays him with a vintage ROBERT AXLE MACE CAM

She ejects the floppy disk as Axle runs away eyes burning
He nearly smacks into a tree redirects and gets away

INT CLAIRES APARTMENT BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

When did you learn to sew

About six years ago when I started
the Center

AXLE

Its nice the sewing Are you gay

CLAIRE
What kind of a question is that

AXLE
If you are its cool with me I just
want you to be happy

CLAIRE
Just because my life isnt bogged
down by some man child who wants to
have a say in everything I do who I
do it with and when it gets done
-No Im not gay I wish it were
that simple

AXLE
Well none of you girls seem to date
and I find it a little bit odd

CLAIRE
Donna has been engaged to three
different men and never gone through
with it No man will ever measure up
to her father Phoebe dates but
doesnt bring girls home to meet us
because she thinks we would judge her
and I am very much looking forward to
falling in love but not until I get
my shit together

AXLE
See there three things Ive learned
about Claire Axle started sewing six
years ago doesnt have time for men
and loves the paper

Claire puts the paper down to address her father directly

He takes

Two more things My last name is not
Axle and Im fond of boundaries
Hence our thirty day agreement Which
I refuse to budge on

a section of newspaper Tries to give her space

CLAIRE
And I do have time for men just not

My first memory as a human being was
the house on Inverness Court You
used to sit on the floor with me
trying to get me to understand how my
stuffed animals and Barbies were all
linked together by atoms and
molecules

LESLIE
Are you here to reminisce or do you
have something for me

AXLE
Depends you havent so much as
offered me a cup of coffee yet

LESLIE
You have sixty seconds before I call--

AXLE
We live in a society so paranoid
about losing their children that they
are willing to tie them to a leash

Leslie looks completely disinterested

Imagine if we made that leash
wireless so the kid doesnt feel
like a dog The instant he or she
wanders outside a certain range the
parent gets a vibration on the
receiver

INT LESLIES OFFICE (FORMERLY AXLES) - CONTINUOUS

Because theyre not marketed to kids

Leslie sits at his desks starts returning e-mails

AXLE
What if we buried the technology
inside a kids watch Not just any
watch the coolest gadget watch ever
It plays music video games takes
pictures e-mails the works

Leslie keeps e-mailing as if he hadnt heard a thing

AXLE
We do this right and every kid in the
world will be begging their parents
to buy it for them And parents will
be happy to do it because of--

LESLIE
the child security aspect

Axle smacks his hands together Bingo Leslie gets it

AXLE

All things are intrinsically
connected regardless of how different
they--

Leslie gives him the hand Axle zips it

Ill give you thirty grand for the
idea Presuming you walk away

LESLIE
Do you know how hard it was to
distance ourselves from you

This stings Axle even though he knows it to be true

AXLE
Do you know how hard it is for me to
distance myself from me

Leslie considers his point

LESLIE
I cant get back into the Robert Axle

Donna glowing Phoebe feeling out of place mows on hors
doeuvres Jerry and Lorraine are the only ones dancing

Claire schmoozes philanthropists JACK and GAIL WALTHER her
best foot forward

CLAIRE
Part of it is providing the basic
resources Things that enable a
recovering addict or homeless person
to get back on their feet Computers
Clothes food education access to
technology The other part is
presenting those resources in a way
that really impacts their self
esteem Letting them know that
somebody cares enough to prepare
their food with high end organic
ingredients or giving them brand new
name brand clothes that actually fit
and dont have stains on them

JACK
The fact that you have been able to
raise enough money to sustain this
year after year is truly amazing

GAIL

lucky to have you

like scavengers

EX-HUSBAND

He circles Axle like a roman gladiator

three hours

AXLE
Im no expert on Centers For Women
but it seems to me maybe you have too
much overhead Do you really need all
those fancy computers Whats wrong
with looking for jobs out of the want

ads
PHOEBE
(to herself)
Bad idea
CLAIRE

Maybe youre right Maybe designing a
center where underprivileged women
dont actually feel underprivileged
was shortsighted

AXLE
Claire

CLAIRE
Maybe you should have introduced your
vision for the Center during that
stirring aquatic symphony speech

LORRAINE
Claire

CLAIRE
And maybe just maybe you should
have had a spunky ten year old girl
as your sidekick while giving said
speech

AXLE
Dont pin that on me Being my
sidekick was your idea

CLAIRE
I wanted to be in your life not your
stupid infomercials

Axle looks around the room all eyes on him He takes a
moment gathers himself

SAM
MP3 Games E-mail Bluetooth The
whole mess

AXLE
Do they work

SAM
Tested them all night Rock solid
Plus they have compasses built in In
case the kid wanders off he can find
his way home

AXLE
Do kids use compasses
SAM
Sure they do
AXLE

Seems a like overkill since we have
the wireless leash technology

SAM
A wireless leash Now thats an idea
That way if the kid wanders off the
parents would get a buzz or
something

AXLE
Sam

SAM
I did good right

Axle collects himself realizing Sams not all there anymore

You did an amazing job

what “There’s no GM” I’m the guy

They just don’t want to give me the

A brief stare down Troys high trying to act sober

AXLE
Hows midnight sound

TROY
Sounds good Sounds real good

INT CLAIRES APARTMENT - THAT AFTERNOON

Axle sits on this thinking hes alone closes his eyes and
finds the meditative calm he used to rely on in prison

PHOEBE (0S)
Why did you do it

Axle almost jumps out of his skin He flips a secondary lamp
on and reveals Phoebe stone cold sober

AXLE
Do what

PHOEBE
Kiss me Why did you do it

AXLE
If I remember correctly it was you
who kissed me

They share an intimate look But cooler heads prevail

PHOEBE
You felt my tits how were they

AXLE
Can you stop using that word
PHOEBE
Tits
AXLE
Yes
PHOEBE

Whats wrong with tits

AXLE
Youre an intelligent witty
attractive young woman The tough guy
talk it sells you short

For the first time Phoebe is at a loss for words

AXLE
But for the record they felt nice
Not too big Not too small Right
where you wanna be

INT CENTER FOR WOMEN - DUSK

Patients move in and out of the different treatment rooms
Not women who know one another but there is an unspoken bond
between them Claire leans against the wall disconnected
realizing this is all coming to an end

INT FAMILYMART WAREHOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Axle combs through boxes of returns Behind him a bevy of
electronics tools and diagnostic equipment

AXLE
You want something done right you
gotta do it yourself Troy

Troy looks stressed out of his mind

AXLE
Just because I dont have some fancy
engineering degree doesnt mean I
cant mock up a prototype I used to
do all my prototypes back in the day

TROY
When I first got promoted to
Assistant GM I used to wash the
parking lot with a pressure hose
every Sunday morning

AXLE
Didnt you have people who would do
that for you

TROY
Not the way I like it done

AXLE
You really love Familymart dont you

Troy looks away sore subject

AXLE
Troy theres something I need you to
do for me

Troy stands at attention

AXLE
I need you to blow off work tomorrow
and come to this pitch meeting with
me And you have to take the lead

Troys frozen with fear

AXLE
Nobodys going to buy something from
the guy that hacks peoples fingers
off But Troy Coangelo thats a
different story

Axle begins dissecting one of the off brand wireless child
leash systems

TROY
I was a copier salesman before I got
this job Lasted six days

AXLE
You were fired

TROY
Threw up on one of the machines I
get nervous in meetings

AXLE

Thats not going to happen this time
All you have to do is explain from
your point of view as Assistant GM of
the third most profitable Familymart
in the city how often kids get
separated from their parents and how
a fabrication like this would help

TROY
Doesnt fabrication mean lie

AXLE
Fine Dont use that word

INT CLAIRES APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - 4 AM

Axle enters bleary eyed puts Donnas bike away Around the

AXLE
Hey you

Shes reattaching the lining of a vintage mens sport coat

CLAIRE
Its a 44 Regular but we can make it
work

AXLE

Make it work for who
CLAIRE
I cant have my father looking gender
neutral at the biggest meeting of his
life
She puts the jacket on him A little big but he looks great
AXLE

Am I supposed to wear the pink rain
coat with this

She marks where the buttons go

CLAIRE
Yeah no Sorry about that

Axle fights back tears

AXLE
Its my fault the fund raiser bombed

CLAIRE
We were never going to raise enough
to keep the Center open

AXLE
You deserve better

CLAIRE
The girls at the Center deserve
better I have plenty

Claire takes his coat off returns to the sewing table

AXLE
Even before we had money I was still
a lousy father

CLAIRE
I have a few good memories

AXLE
The brown horse

Claires now focused on button sewing Axle sits on the foot
of the bed his back to Claire

CLAIRE
I remember holding screws and wing
nuts when you were building things in
the garage

AXLE
I remember wishing you would get
bored and go away so I could

concentrate

CLAIRE
I remember you going to my dance
recitals

AXLE

I remember asking Lorraine to sign
you up for dance so that I wouldnt
have to feel guilty for working
weekends

CLAIRE
Im not one of those people who
blames everything on her childhood

AXLE
Its okay to be angry I would be
angry too if I were you

Claire returns with the jacket Puts it on him fastens the
button Her eyes welled up

CLAIRE
All those years no one would buy any
of your bullshit prototypes I
believed in you It wasnt mom It
was me You got famous and forgot
about me I worshipped you and you
couldnt even see me Do you know
what that does to a kid

He tries to give her a hug She indulges him then pulls back

CLAIRE
Yeah Im not really a hugger

She returns to the sewing table

CLAIRE
(cracking a smile)
But I appreciate the gesture

AXLE
(smiling back)
Yet another thing I learn about
Claire Elizabeth Not a hugger

AXLE
Just Watchdawg It plays MP3s
video games takes pictures and has

vibration Ten feet away two shorter
vibrations Fifteen is three so on
and so on

SHEILA
Does the prototype work

TROY
Does a bear shit in the woods

AXLE
Send it an e-mail

Sheila fires off a test e-mail from her iPhone

TROY
Wait till you hear the music

Troy digs out a pair of wireless headphones from his pocket

AXLE
Actually we forgot to load the music

SHEILA
E-mail just bounced back

AXLE
But the leash part definitely works

He hands the prototype to Troy Shews him away

AXLE
Troy go down the hall Go
TROY
Why do I have to be the one that

AXLE

Im not saying you have to be the one

MATT
You know what Im going to cut you
off right there--

AXLE
Im telling you Mike it works

MATT
I met with Steven Leslie two days

similar Calls it Watch-Me

Axle smiles hiding utter devastation

MATT
Hes fast tracking it Wants it in
play for this holiday season wants

And just when it cant get any worse Troy vomits Axle grabs
paper towels and starts cleaning up the mess Troy studies
him How far the mighty have fallen

MATT
He stole this from you didnt he

No response from Axle

MATT
Tell me you had Leslie sign something
before you brought him the best idea
youve had in fifteen years

Axle ties up the plastic liner of Matts trash then stops

AXLE

No I didnt I didnt have you sign
one either Maybe Im naive Maybe
Im old school But this is my idea
Its pure Its timely and I will get
it to market with or without you So
if you want to invest in the copycat
version be my guest But I promise
you Steven Leslie is the wrong horse
and if you bet on him you will lose

Matt stares him down for a beat the smiles

Okay what What just happened

steps back A hand shake will do just fine

six figure advance on the sale of a
life changing invention today that

Just as he pops a bottle of Champagne

AXLE
That would be me Robert Axle The
same Robert Axle who went to prison
for maiming thousands of people The
same Robert Axle who couldnt hold
down a janitor job at Familymart

Nothing from the girls

AXLE
Did I mention the six figure advance
Theres also a major bonus that kicks
in if we beat Leslie to the market
which I have no doubt we will do

Axle picks up on the heaviness in the room pushes forward

AXLE
I told this Matt James fella its
not rocket science You set the date
for the product launch A date you
know he cant hit Then you back time
everything from there Product launch
is key Gotta make a big splash

PHOEBE
(open minded)
Somebody stole Donnas identity
Opened a credit card in her name and
ran up a five thousand dollar bill

DONNA
(accusatory)
Had the card sent to Mailboxes Etc
right around the corner within
walking distance

Axle considers his options

CLAIRE
I gave you thirty days to clean up
your life it only took you thirteen
to mess it up for good

I have a check for 125000 in my
pocket I can pay Donna back with
interest Pay rent here Get the
