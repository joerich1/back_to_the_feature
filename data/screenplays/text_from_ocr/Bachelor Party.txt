SHOOTING DRAFT

FADE IN
EXT ST ANNS SCHOOL - DAY

CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed innocent children
obediently standing in line like recruits for the Holy
Crusade PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray
blazers striped ties and navy slacks of St Lukes School
They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the
statue of the schools sainted namesake One of the fifth
grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow The
other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS a
stern-faced nun appears behind them grabbing them both
firmly by the shoulders

SISTER MARY FRACIS
Make one more move and youll both
be staying late for the rest of the
week

THE BOYS
(softly in unison)
Sorry Sister Mary Francis

SISTER MARY FRANCIS
I didnt hear you

THE BOYS
(louder)
Sorry Sister Mary Francis

Sister Mary Francis checks her watch She scowls and looks
out past the parking lot gate

Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full
throttle There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES followed by the
loud GRINDING of GEARS It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking
place around the corner

SISTER MARY FRANCIS
(used to this)
Step away from the curb children
ANOTHER ANGLE

Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school
bus It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels
The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes leaving ten feet
of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting
halt right in front of them The front door immediately swings
open and RICK STAHL the driver hops out Rick is the life

of the party even when there isnt any party going on

While chronologically older than the St Luke students the
only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a
drivers license Rick figures hell live up to his
capabilities and get serious in his next life This
incarnations strictly for laughs Sister Mary Francis steps
up to him

SISTER MARY FRANCIS
Youre late again Rick

RICK
I know Sister but I have a very
good excuse

SISTER MARY FRANCIS
There can be no excuse for tardiness

RICK
Youre absolutely right I should
never have stopped to save that
drowning infant Im just weak
Sister Im so weak

He starts sobbing softly into his hands

SISTER MARY FRANCIS
All right stop that Children on
the bus

The kids obediently file past Rick who makes like he is
drying his tears with his handkerchief

RICK
Sister do you ever get lonely after
vespers If you do why dont you
give me a call Im in the book

SISTER MARY FRANCIS
(smiling despite

herself)
Get going Rick youre late enough
as it is
RICK

Right Think it over
He hops on the bus closes the door and gently backs the bus
out of the parking lot

INT BUS - DAY

As soon as the bus is out of sight of the school all hell
breaks loose The formally well-mannered children are acting
like normal kids hitting each other over the heads with
books running up and down the aisles screaming at the top
of their lungs

ANGLE - RICK
He removes the St Christopher statue from the dashboard
revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt He watches
the madness behind him in his rearview mirror picks up the
PA microphone and rationally attempts to restore order
RICK
(over mike)
If you dont all calm down Im gonna
drive this thing over a cliff
The kids pay no attention to him
RICK
(continuing
philosophically)
Ah youth
EXT THE BUS
Ricks bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled
with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it
The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his
engine Rick counters by gunning his
INT THE BUS
All the kids start screaming Race race Wipe em out
Go for it Etc Some of the kids even start taking out
money and start betting one another on the races outcome
ANGLE - RICK
as he readies for action

EXT THE BUSES

The light turns green and theyre off Or as off as two lunky
school buses filled with kids can be

WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

The two buses come zooming down the street
INT RICKS BUS

The kids are screaming at Rick to go faster One of the little
boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him

EXT THE STREET - LOW ANGLE

The buses squeeze down a narrow street neck and neck with
one another

INT THE BUS

The kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick who
is hunched over in his seat driving with the determination
of Andy Granitelli The nauseous kid is now turning a pale
shade of green He moves to an open window straining to
control the inevitable

EXT THE BUSES
They race down a steep hill

INT THE BUS

The nauseous kid cant hold it any longer
EXT THE OTHER BUS

Something hits with a splat against the windshield that
resembles Campbells Chunky Vegetable Soup

INT THE OTHER BUS

The other Driver turns on the windshield It only makes it
worse

EXT THE STREET

Ricks bus pulls out in front accompanied by the cheering
of his passengers Suddenly a stop light looms ahead Rick
puts on his brakes Both buses stop just in time

INT RICKS BUS

Ricks kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the
front of the bus Although disheveled the kids still manage
a victorious cheer

PHOTOGRAPHERS POV

year-old baby boy Hes sitting on a cuddly blanket We HEAR
the VOICE of Jay ONeill He is a baby photographer at Sears

ONEILL (0OS)
There

ONEILL

We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera
department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest
of the store Hes conservatively dressed in a suit vest

and tie He looks like he could be a Young Republican But
under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center Ricks
best friend Need we say more He takes the film out of the
camera The matronly mother is in the process of gathering

up her baby

ONEILL

She smiles and exits

ONEILL

She starts to unbutton her blouse ONeill looks into his
camera

Now lean in a little more more
more
As she complies her breasts all but spill out of her dress
ONEILL (0OS)

(continuing)
Hold that pose
ONEILL

He runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman
THROUGH CAMERA LENS

We SEE a QUICK SERIES of camera flashes Each pose finds him
near her breasts He has them on his head Hes cheek to

breast Etc

RICK

enters and witnesses the photo session He immediately jumps
into the shots

THROUGH CAMERA LENS

Rick joins the craziness After several beats the Woman
gets bored and EXITS the FRAME

THE WOMAN

As Rick and ONeill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds
in a photo booth the Woman takes her child and exits A few
beats pass and the guys notice theyre alone

ONEILL
Whered she go

RICK
She probably had sex scheduled for
1230 ONeill lets pick up the
guys for a drink I have major
news to announce

ONeill crosses to his camera and takes out the film

ONEILL
Okay be right with ya

RICK
He picks up some photographs of todays work

Their babies are barely visible if at all

EXT CHULOS AUTO SHOP - DAY

Ricks school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop
Several Chicanos are working on various cars Rick and ONeill
hop out

RICK
Hey Chulo where are you man

ANGLE - LATE-MODEL CAR

We SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under

the chassis Slowly a large bear-like body rolls out and

we catch our first glimpse of CHULO A happy-go-lucky mechanic
of Mexican ancestry

CHULO
Hey you guys whats going on

RICK
Were going for a little liquid
refreshment

CHULO
Great Ill go with you Wait a
second Hey Raul Move that car

A SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind
them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot

CHULO
(continuing)
Roberto you finished fixing that
lighter yet

Another MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes
his head Just then Raul the eye-patched worker whizzes by
behind the guys driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right
into traffic

CHULO
(continuing to Rick)
Im glad you guys came by Whats
the occasion

ONEILL
Ricks got an important announcement
to make

CHULO

Yeah What is it

RICK

CHULO
Too bad man that blows my chance
to be Ambassador to France
Behind them we can SEE Roberto fiddling with the lighter
Suddenly flames leap out of the car blowing Roberto ten
feet into the air

ANGLE

The guys all start to pile into the bus Nearby another
employee is washing down the garage with a hose

Chulo turns to another mechanic who has his head under the
hood of a car

CHULO
Manuel be sure and finish up the
electrical system on that Chevy

Manuel waves at Chulo who turns hops on the bus Rick starts
it up and starts to drive away Just as the bus CLEARS FRAME
we SEE Manuel connect two wires together at the same moment
the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet
Manuel lights up like a Christmas tree screaming in pain
There is a beat and then Robert falls INTO FRAME still
holding the cigarette lighter and the car Raul is driving
enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage

INT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

A sign on an office door says CONCERT TICKET AGENCY From
inside we HEAR someone TALKING loudly on the phone Chulo
Rick and ONeill open the door and go inside On the walls

in the cramped office there are rock n roll concert posters
advertising rock bands like Men At Work The Clash and Barry
Manilow Behind a cluttered desk we FIND a little man with a
thin mustache and horn-rimmed glasses This is GARY MELNITZ
wheeler-dealer entrepreneur and coward Gary yells a lot
which is a definite overcompensation for his size and
inability to deal with the opposite sex

GARY
(yelling into phone)
Screw you Screw that Dont

CUT TO
EXT THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY
We SEE a couple of very contemporary looking 15-year-olds
going into a very now clothing store -- like Fred Segals

When the door opens loud ROCK N ROLL MUSIC blasts out

INT THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY
Inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving
narcissistically to the music like theyre at a disco The
cashier PHOEBE has devoted her life to following the current
trends and fads no matter how inane they may be Today shes
in a reggae mode her hair wound into tight dreadlocks as

she sways lost in the ozone to the music A CUSTOMER
approaches her with a purchase

CUSTOMER
Id like to pay for these

PHOEBE
Huh What Oh sure wait till
this song is over

She floats off again

One of the young MALE CUSTOMERS approaches an attractive
salesgirl This is DEBBIE THOMERSON Ricks intended She
seems to be the only sane employee in the place because shes
actually working putting clothes on the racks This
impression of sanity fits her as she is level-headed and
has a clear sense of herself She can also take a joke thus
her engagement to Rick

CUSTOMER
Excuse me where can I try on these
pants

DEBBIE

Right over here

She leads the Customer to the try-on booths The Customer
enters one We SEE that the saloon-style doors of the booths
have been hung too high so as he takes off his pants his
underwear is exposed to the world We PULL BACK REVEALING
other people in other booths their bare asses clearly in
sight No one in the store seems to care however as they
are much too busy dancing

The front door opens and BOBBIE a very sultry and earthy-
looking girl with long dark hair pushes inside She is
ONeills girl and Debbies best friend Shes also someone
who would party every night if given half a chance

BOBBIE
(excited)
Debbie I dont believe it Im so
excited
DEBBIE

Bobbie what are you talking about

BOBBIE

great I dont believe it
Phoebe crosses to them

PHOEBE
Whats happening

BOBBIE
Debbies marrying Rick

PHOEBE

DEBBIE
Yes its true

PHOEBE
Ohmygod

The girls screech and jump around hugging each other in
sheer joy A MALE CUSTOMER moved by this outpouring of
affection moves over and gets in the middle of the girls
enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once

DEBBIE
(to Customer realizing)
Would you get out of here

Reluctantly the guy retreats back to the Calvin Klein jeans
rack

BOBBIE
Does Cole know about this

PHOEBE
Really -- you went with him for two
years

DEBBIE

He still thinks Im going with him
Im going to break the news to him
tomorrow

BOBBIE
Hes not gonna be happy And your
parents cant be too thrilled either

DEBBIE
No As far as theyre concerned the
only good Rick is a dead Rick But I

PHOEBE

BOBBIE
Deb I want to throw you a shower

DEBBIE
Oh thats really sweet Id love

PHOEBE

BOBBIE

The girls all start to scream and carry on all over again
INT RICK AND DEBBIES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rick is cooking dinner in the cramped combination kitchen
living room He has about five dishes going at once as he
dashes from stove to refrigerator He grabs some hamburger
meat rolls it into a ball then slaps it on the counter He
then takes a steam iron and presses it on the patty

Debbie comes in the front door and crosses to him and hugs
him tightly kissing him sweetly

DEBBIE

DEBBIE

Rick crosses to the stove A small fire is coming out of one
of the frying pans He douses it with water

RICK
Dont worry its supposed to do
this

DEBBIE

(setting the table)
Want to hear something great Bobbie

food to the table)

knocking the dishes to the floor
EXT BEL AIR-TYPE ESTATE - DAY

Through the iron gates of an impressive-looking estate comes
Debbie in her convertible VW Rabbit She pulls up behind a

new Porsche 911 and a Jeep all decked out with rifles nets
and other hunting equipment As she walks down the path toward
the house she sees something off in the distance that
startles her

DEBBIES POV

A large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side
door of the house

Over here Deb in the Smokehouse

CAMERA PANS WITH Debbie as she enters the room She passes
several trophies guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from
the wall She makes her way past some sections of an
undetermined animals anatomy hanging from hooks suspended
from the ceiling Finally we see COLE WHITTIER a Steve Garvey
look-alike rugged all-American and heir to the Whittier
Plastic Wrap fortune Despite his jockish good looks and
outward arrogance theres something in his manner that is
definitely unsavory

As Debbie approaches him we SEE that he is butchering some
unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of

him (NOTE For the squeamish all of this is done OUT OF
FRAME The only thing we should HEAR are the delightful SOUNDS
of TAXIDERMY)

COLE

surgeons skill)

INT DR STAN STAHLS OFFICE - DAY

DR STAN is Ricks older brother and a proctologist Although
hes only in his early thirties he thinks and acts like
someone in their early 70s A little on the pompous side
Stan is never without his pipe

STAN

He crosses to a sterile container and takes out a syringe

RICK
You wouldnt hurt your own brother

Rick hugs her uneasily trying to make sure her right hand
doesnt come anywhere near his face

Debbie and Rick and her MOM and DAD are having a frustrating
game of tennis behind her parents plush home Mr Thomerson

being tough and competitive His wife loves to shop As far
as shes concerned appearances are everything Neither of
them likes Ricks appearance or anything else about their
future son-in-law Mr Thomerson slams the ball to Rick
Rick slams the ball back and drives it over the fence out
of the court

RICK

Mr Thomerson rolls his eyes knowing hes been wasting his
breath He grabs the pitcher of lemonade and Rick grabs the
tray which is filled with fresh lemons They get up at the
same time and collide sending the lemonade all over Mr T
and the lemons bounding over the fence

pick up

FATHER FALWELL
If everyone would take their
positions

Everyone takes their places for the wedding procession The
wind now takes this time to blow with much greater force As
Father Falwell opens his Bible the wind rips the pages out
of the Holy Book They blow to the four corners of the Earth

FATHER FALWELL
(continuing)
Oh dear Well lets begin And

He hums the Wedding March Chulo hums along His humming is
a driving Jimi Hendrix-like guitar lick that all but drowns
out Fathers humming

FATHER FALWELL
Hes orchestrating the proceedings

FATHER FALWELL
Flower Girls Now Rick
(he gestures for him
to start down the
aisle)
Good Debbie and Mr Thomerson

As he gestures for them to make their walk to him a gust of
wind lifts up Fathers cassock exposing his bare ass He
quickly grabs his cassock and covers himself

RICK

Rivas

Miss Rivas Yes How would you
solve our countrys present economic
problems

LAVERNE
Who me

MC
Yes

LAVERNE

Thats a good question From the way
I understand it according to supply
side economics when supply exceeds
demand recession is the result
Thats why I think we should control
the credit markets and increase the
prime rate That way the consumer
price index will stabilize and we
will have economic recovery

He is totally blown away

drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her Mike
the Donkey obediently does as hes told moving to her ina
trance-like very turned-on state

DESIREE
Cmon Mike Come to Mama

The Donkey takes another step forward and then suddenly
rears up on his hind legs snorting He starts bucking wildly
The crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk

for a few seconds then without warning collapses in a heap
on the floor

Everyone goes rushing up to it

Chulo and Laverne enter the room followed by several of the

Mr Thomerson in the bedroom picks up the receiver As he
does so a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece He
screams at Rick gesturing with the phone in his hand as he
dials Each move produces a large cloud of powder which
causes him to sniffle slightly

MR THOMERSON
I never liked you Ive never liked
any of your friends Ive hated you
from the first time I saw you And
now you are out of my life You are
out of my life

He starts to react from inhaling the powder He puts the
receiver to his ear He takes a deep breath and tries to
dial another number A large cloud of coke flies up his nose
Hes stunned He takes another deep drag Hes hooked He
forgets all about dialing He jams the receiver against his
nose and takes deep drag after deep drag

Desiree still wearing her leather mask crosses to him and
sits down next to him on the bed He gives her a big wide
smile

wearing a leather mask tied to the bed and happily licking
Desirees boots which she dangles in front of him She also
holds a whip over his head Despite the mask there is
something very familiar about his face and the white powder
encrusted all over his nose

Debbie picks up on this immediately

DEBBIE
(shocked)

hes been caught with his bondage down He tries to say

A city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center
of the street A man in the back of the truck is leisurely
placing orange cones in the center line of the road

Cole with Debbie in tow grabs the trucks DRIVER and hauls
him out of his seat He then places Debbie inside the truck
and him at the wheel He peels out Our man with the cones

in the back is unaware of what has happened He keeps placing
the cones on the street However now the truck is hitting
speeds in the upper 70s The mans leisure pace speeds up
He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed

He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back Behind them
on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman

A fight starts in the movie also The patrons sit calmly
watching the action Miraculously Ricks fight with Cole is
in perfect sync with the actors in the movie Rick hits Cole
with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie
patrons The patrons are impressed by the realism of the
films special effects Cole throws a punch Rick ducks The
punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth

MAN
(to LADY next to him)
Gee what a realistic effect

WOMAN

Best 3D Ive ever seen

As the movie ends Rick has Cole by the collar and is dragging
him out of the theater

INT MALL OUTSIDE THEATER

Rick exits the theater with Cole He tosses Cole to Chulo
Debbie comes running behind Rick

RICK
(to Debbie)

RICK
This has been quite a night Heres
a thought Why dont we go home and
give our private parts a workout

DEBBIE
(hugging him)
Youre so romantic

The Patrons are exiting All of them are very up and excited
by their 3D experience

WOMAN

A Man who has taken a punch and has had his jacket ripped to
shreds doesnt seem pleased

MAN

EXT BLUFF - DAY

Its another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean
Just right for Rick and Debbies wedding We SEE the wedding
in progress The area is adorned with flowers

The many guests are seated and taken in the moment Among
these are Tracey Desiree and Garys she-man who waves to
Gary as he stands with the other ushers Chulo Ryko and
Larry Chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears He
looks over at Laverne who smiles to him

CHULO
(to Ryko)
Hey man dont forget my bachelor
partys next Friday night

GARY

RYKO
No way

Nearby stand the maids of honor Bobbie Phoebie and Ilene
who blows a kiss to her date Ray (one of the Japanese
businessmen)

The Thomersons sit in the front row Neither of them is
cherishing this moment

MR THOMERSON
(sotto to Mrs
Thomerson)
Well have morons for grandkids
(resigned to the fact)
But at least well have grandkids

They sort of smile at each other at the thought

Father Falwell is almost through with the ceremony A car
pulls up in the bg Exiting the car is Stan and a WOMAN
ONeill the best man sees the car He pokes Rick He
indicates to Rick someone has arrived

STAN

We SEE the man in the car is Stan He ushers the lady in the
car to Larry Hes surprised at who she is his wife

LARRY

SUE

LARRY

Larry looks to Rick and gives him a warm smile and a wave
Rick acknowledges Larry

LARRY

They walk off
FATHER FALWELL

FATHER FALWELL
Now before I pronounce you man and
wife the groom wishes to recite his
vow to Debbie Richard

THOMERSONS
They fear the worst

MR THOMERSON
Oh God Almighty

RICK
He turns to Debbie He waits a beat and begins

RICK
Cheese I love you more than cheese
And I love cheese a lot

THOMERSONS
They hide their faces in their hands
Off in the distance a storm is coming
in fast over the ocean The wind
begins to pick up Undaunted Rick
continues his soliloquy

RICK
In fact more than dairy products in
general I love dairy My love is
cream Pour me on the cereal of your
life
Now it starts to rain

FATHER FALWELL

He wants this to end He calls softly to Rick trying to get
his attention

FATHER FALWELL
Rick Rick Hey

People begin to scurry for cover In the bg under a tree
we SEE Larry and his wife huddled in each others arms From
the way they look they have worked things out

RICK
RICK
I think this song pretty much sums

up the way I feel at this moment

He begins to sing the theme from The Flintstones with all
the gusto of Jack Jones

Father Falwell has had enough

FATHER FALWELL
(rapid fire)
I now pronounce you man and wife
Goodbye

He blesses them lightning fast and springs for his car
THE SCENE

CREDITS ROLL as Rick continues to sing in the driving rain
Debbie joins in on the chorus She loves her man

Everyone has run for the safety of their cars Everyone but
the Thomersons who sit and look on bewildered

RICK AND DEBBIE
Flintstones meet the Flintstones
Theyre a prehistoric family From
the town of Bedrock Theyre a page
right out of history

FADE OUT

THE END
