ENCRYPT
by Richard Taylor

FADE IN

THE EARTH

spins in mortal turmoil A vast spinner of clouds the size of
Australia approaches the west coast of North America
lightning flashing thunder BELLOWING and CRACKLING The sky
glows red and purple angry and crazy This is the planet
made Gothic by human intervention

SEATTLE - THE SPACE NEEDLE

is buffeted by hundred-and-fifty-mile-an-hour winds Plate
glass shatters and explodes

SAN FRANCISCO - THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE

quakes before the raging wind A giant tsunami surges toward
the great suspension bridge When it passes cables have been
wrenched untwining and collapse appears imminent

EXT LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

The city is a swamp some buildings on dry ground others
below sea level Far south and east of its northern cousins
the full thrust of the storm has not struck Los Angeles yet
Smoke from open fires trail skyward like ghosts and spread
along the ceiling of the sky even as it bleeds rain
everywhere

A TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL (MANDY)

runs terrified down a decayed city street She clutches
something in her dirt-caked hands holds it dear to her

breast

The girl slides around a corner on her bottom stares back

GIRLS POV - THE STREET

seems derelict A flash of lightning reveals men scurrying
like rats after her

RESUME AND FOLLOW MANDY (A MONTAGE)

as she turns and scrambles away Her pursuers follow her
everywhere — around rusting cars through an abandoned MTA
bus and across the rubble of a building that once dispensed
happy meals and toys

Mandy dives into a burrow beneath piled debris

One of the men walks directly toward her

Another scurries chortling madly around to her side

A third man approaches from behind

Mandy clutches her prize ever-more tightly and prays that
they dont see her

They do

The leader lifts Mandy from the debris her naked legs
dangling from beneath her torn dress

LEAD RAT
Lookit what I got

Mandy struggles and screams Lead Rat covers her mouth

Limping Rat snatches the prize from her fingers A dinner
roll hard as a rock and twice as filthy

LIMPING RAT
So thats what youre hiding little
girl Dont you want to share You want
to share right
Mandy writhes free enough to say

MANDY
Take it Take it Just leave me alone

Chortling Rat arrives His fingers pinch Mandys leg

CHORTLING RAT
This little girls plump

Lead Rat drops her to the ground assesses her
LEAD RAT

You got family girl with anything to
trade

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 3

Mandy understands immediately

MANDY
Yes Yes my daddys got canned goods
And gasoline

Lead Rat thinks about this The dinner roll lying abandoned
nearby suggests not

CHORTLING RAT
Shed feed us for a week

LIMPING RAT
(grinning of Chortling Rat as

he assesses girl)
I dunno You still on that diet

Mandy screams and tries to break away Lead Rat holds her in
a vise grip

Chortling Rat kneels beside the little girl

CHORTLING RAT
(of leader)
I never took you for squeamish

That settles it Lead Rat produces a huge switchblade It
snaps out steel catching the light

Mandy screams

An arrow slams through Lead Rats neck He doesnt move not
believing

JOHN GARTH STANDS ON A WALL (SCENE)

a hard man with hawk eyes now focused on killing Even though
he is a warrior there is something humane about John Garth
He knows there is no glory to what he is doing His rock-like
exposed arms hold the bows tension like the cables of a
suspension bridge and shake with the load He releases

Lead Rat faces death and drops

Limping Rat is already scurrying away weapon drawn when
Garths second arrow catches him He drops

Chortling Rat whining fearfully scuttles around debris
hiding his silhouette He pulls a nasty looking automatic and
looks up to find a target when an arrow slams into him He
falls

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 4

Garth drops to the ground walks to Mandy who stands sucking
air like the price is going up

JOHN GARTH
Your mothers worried

Mandy shakes her head crazily Yes I know

Garth kneels beside her Mandy bursts into his arms He holds
her like a father until her sobs diminish

GARTH
You shouldnt go out by yourself

Mandy buries her head in his chest safe now

MANDY
But Im hungry John

GARTH
I know

Garth releases her and steps past to harvest the arrow that
took Lead Rats life He takes the switchblade as well

Mandy scurries to where the dinner roll lies and retrieves
it She tries to bite into it Hard as stone
BESIDE LIMPING RATS CORPSE - GARTH

harvests the second arrow using the switchblade to cut the
arrow out

Mandy staggers to Garths side She looks yearningly at
Limping Rat Clutching Garths leg

MANDY
It would be a waste to just leave them
here
GARTH
(understanding her meaning)
No
MANDY
But Im hungry
GARTH
You stay here I have to get my other

arrow

Garth moves to get the arrow

Mandy waits nervously near Limping Rats corpse When Garth
returns he scoops her up and starts walking away

Looking back from Garths arms Mandys hungry eyes remain on
the corpse

EXT SURVIVORS CAMP - NIGHT

Its a hovel bandaged with debris Campfires burn with
constant complaint sizzling embers and hissing wood once
shaped by hand Mist clouds everything

Men and women guard the ramparts some with guns some with
bows like Garths

A GUARD
Someones coming

The men scramble to the walls

GARTHS VOICE
(a shout)
John Garth

A moment later Garth enters the camp with Mandy carried on
his hip
Mandys mother rushes to take her into her arms as Garth

drops her

MANDYS MOM
Mandy

MANDY
Look Mom I found some bread

MANDYS MOM
Where were you Ive been worried to
death

GARTH
Shes okay I found her about six blocks
south near Pico

MANDYS MOM

Mom Look bread

MANDYS MOM
You put that away now One of the
hunters found meat We have stew

Garth turns at this information Meat

MANDY

MANDYS MOM

Garth questions this silently then turns to head for his
digs

EXTINT GARTHS DIGS - NIGHT

An often-repaired tent Garth throws the entry flap back
enters to find his father MATTHEW Garth grown older and

weaker He lies in a hammock recovering from a broken leg

MATTHEW
Youre not dead I see

Storing his equipment

GARTH
Not yet Hows the leg
MATTHEW
Im hobbling about Anything happen out

Garth turns to survey his father pulls three cans of
Campbells soup from his jacket

Matthew snorts

MATTHEW
Rodriguez says he killed a deer Brought
the meat in already butchered There

Garth understands Meat Of the human variety After a
moment

GARTH
How bout some Campbells soup MM-MM-

Cream of mushroom chicken noodle
and cream of tomato

MATTHEW
(smacking his lips)
Chicken noodle Ill stoke the fire
GARTH

Garth pulls his survival knife and begins to open one of the
cans

DISSOLVE

INT GARTHS DIGS - NIGHT

Garth and Matthew lie asleep after their repast Matthew in
his hammock Garth on a bed made of old clothes

EXT SURVIVORS CAMP - NIGHT

Guards walk lonely beats behind walls of debris

Suddenly a brilliant light appears in the night sky A VOICE
from a loudspeaker

HELICOPTER VOICE
You people in the camp Were looking
for John Garth
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 8

ANOTHER ANGLE - HELICOPTER

hovers a hundred yards from the ramparts its single

directional light bouncing from point to point on the walls

HELICOPTER VOICE
Is he in there

EXT CAMP
Garth exits his digs His father hobbles after

A camp citizen climbs to the top of the walls

CAMP CITIZEN
Hes here What do you want

HELICOPTER VOICE
Were coming in

The chopper sets down

MOMENTS LATER - THREE MEN

enter the camp Two wear LAPD uniforms the third a long coat
with a detective badge pinned to a lapel LAPIERE Hes the
sort of man who becomes a cop because of one perk — power
One of the uniforms carries a cardboard box marked Peaches

The camp citizens give them a wide berth Garth stands one

row back

LAPIERE
Im Detective Lieutenant Oscar LaPiere of
the LAPD

THE CROWD
- hes no cop no police anymore
hes lying (etc)

LAPIERE
Of course there are police left
(smiling confidently)
Were just like you trying to survive
We help when we can

GARTH
You must be pretty busy elsewhere

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 9

Lapieres steady grin belies the heat of his eyes directed at
Garth

LAPIERE
Wheres John Garth

GARTH
What do you want with him

LAPIERE
Ive brought him a gift Are you John
Garth

GARTH

What gift Who sent it

LaPiere allows the question to dangle a moment then steps
aside and gestures to the cop holding the crate to set it
down

LAPIERE
Peaches Name brand not the store
variety packed in syrup

The gasp of camp citizens suggests this might be gold

GARTH
Who sent it

LAPIERE
Anton Reich

Garth kneels beside the cardboard box to check the glue
seals Not tampered with

LAPIERE (CONTD)
I take it youre John Garth

GARTH
Whos Anton Reich And what does he want
with me

Mandy steps through the crowd and kneels beside the box She
is in awe of it

LAPIERE
He wants to hire you He instructed me to
tell you — this is a signing bonus

GARTH
Signing bonus Then its not a gift

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 10

LAPIERE
Oh no Its yours No strings

Garth considers that then tears the box open and hands Mandy
a can She cant suppress her joy Running to her mother

MANDY
Mommy Mommy Look what I got

LAPIERE
(continuing with restrained
disapproval )
You can do with it what you will of
course Mr Reich just wants to take a
meeting with you

Garth removes four cans from the box and gives them to his
father Taking one can for himself Garth shoves what remains
of the box into the arms of the camp leader

GARTH
Share this
(to LaPiere)
Lets go

EXT OUTSIDE THE CAMP - NIGHT

The helicopter looks shiny new as Garth LaPiere and the cops
trudge through debris-ridden terrain Garth uses his survival
knife to open the can of peaches

GARTH
(of chopper )
I didnt think there were any of those
left

LAPIERE

Youd be surprised whats left if you
know the right people

EXTINT THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The chopper flies through the rainy night

Garth pushes the can lid back and drinks thirstily before
lifting a peach slice out and swallowing it whole like a
bear with a fish just caught from a stream LaPiere looks on

with amusement Garth sees his look offers the can

LAPIERE
No thank you Ive eaten

Garth shrugs digs out another fish

EXT UCLA MEDICAL CENTER LANDING PAD - NIGHT

The lights work even if the sign has been damaged UCL(A)
M(ed)ICAL CEN(t)ER The chopper sets down

Garth Lapiere and the attending cops exit and make for the
big hospital building as Garth tosses the empty can of
peaches into an empty wire receptacle

INT UCLA MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT

Garth LaPiere and the uniformed cops make their way into the
building which obviously is no longer in use as a hospital
Even though it appears abandoned the lights work

Garth stops to look around He hasnt seen electric lights in
months

GARTH
Whats powering these lights

LAPIERE
(moving him along)
Mr Reich has his residence on the top
floor

INT UCLA MEDICAL CENTER TOP FLOOR - NIGHT

An immense open bay At one end are stacked platform after
platform of canned goods ammunition oil military weaponry
in cases liquor medical supplies At the opposite end a
mansion in miniature with unblemished furniture Persian
carpets drapes over the windows stands of famous artworks
paintings sculpture and a huge oak desk stolen certainly
from a rich mans office

Men in uniform stand guard beside the elevator door one
LAPD the second MTA One uniform is as good as another
apparently

The elevator opens Garth and LaPiere exit followed by the
two cops

ANOTHER ANGLE - ANTON REICH

is a man of formidable countenance 50 he wears clothes that
in better times might be considered obscenely expensive He

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 12

is a leader a manipulator and a salesman He approaches
Garth as if welcoming an important client extending a hand

REICH
Major Garth welcome Anton Reich

Garth surveys him briefly the proffered hand then turns his
gaze to the cops

REICH (CONTD)
Dont worry Theyre not really police
They work for me now

Garths gaze continues to the flats of canned goods and other
supplies

REICH (CONTD)
Are you hungry Major

GARTH
Oh no I just finished dinner Steak and
lobster a good chardonnay and chocolate
mousse for dessert

REICH
(amused)
Better than my table Im afraid But I
can have my cook whip up something
Major

GARTH
Im not a major

REICH
No of course not Not anymore Who of us
have titles these days Sergeant

LAPIERE
Its Lieutenant Mr Reich

REICH
Mr Garth and I will have dinner in the
residence See to it

LAPIERE
Yes sir

Lapiere turns and moves for the elevator
REICH
(to cops)

You two may leave as well

The two cops follow LaPiere

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 13

Reich takes Garth by the arm and releases him on Garths
look

REICH (CONTD)
While were waiting for dinner can I get
you anything else

GARTH
Well Adolph you can tell me what you
want so I can blow this bunker

REICH
Adolph not such a bad fellow after
all now was he I should think simple
logic would answer your question You
have nothing I could want — except skill
Obviously I want to hire you

GARTH
Im not for hire

REICH
Yes Im certain thats so Do you see
that flat of canned goods back there

Garth looks A mountain eight feet by eight feet A fortune

REICH (CONTD)
I had it brought up here just so you
could see it I usually leave food down
in the pantry In any case there are
sixty cases of beef stew sixty of fruit
cocktail sixty cases of peaches — my
favorite I usually have peaches for
dessert — sixty cases of deviled ham
sixty cases of hash sixty cases of tuna
sixty cases of well I can give you a
manifest

Garth takes in the vast fortune He fails to hide his
astonishment

REICH (CONTD)
Are you still not for hire Major Garth

Garths silence is answer enough

REICH (CONTD)
I thought so

GARTH
Who do you want me to kill

(CONTTNUED )

EnCrypt by Richard

REICH
Kill Kill Killing is easy Major What
I want you to do is much harder Care for
a brandy

Taylor 14

Reich opens a fresh bottle of Courvoisier almost fills two

snifters

GARTH

turns to hand one to Garth

stands before one of a dozen paintings many recognizable
but not this Its a map of the earth with a vast storm not
unlike the Red Spot of Jupiter swirling across the world

Reich presents Garth with a brandy

Garth takes the brandy sniffs and is snatched into

REICH
Youve found my Nilsson Its
magnificent isnt it

enthralled memories

REICH (CONTD)
Its called The Blue Spot It was
painted right after they discovered the
storm that circles the surface of the
earth like The Red Spot circles
Jupiter returning again and again
wreaking havoc Nilsson killed himself
right after he completed it

GARTH
Suicide doesnt exactly distinguish him
does it

REICH
No not at all So many people have
killed themselves Still its a
magnificent piece Most of these pieces
you see here I took into protective
custody from the Getty

GARTH
I thought I recognized some of them

REICH
Which is why I need you Major

GARTH
I told you Im not a major anymore
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 15

REICH
yanks a tarp from a table miniature of an estate

REICH
Come see this

Garth reluctantly joins him

REICH (CONTD)
Do you recognize it

GARTH
The Vincent estate

REICH
Yes Its located across the four-oh-five
from the Getty in the Sepulveda Pass
Its nearly as big too Are you familiar
with Vincent

GARTH
Just that hes rich

REICH
Was rich No ones seen him in years
Hes probably dead Still his estate
remains operative You may have
wondered how it is that we have electric
lights here elevators that work and so
on when the rest of the city has been
reduced to the stone age Its because
UCLA has a nuke in the basement It was
installed for educational purposes but
its large enough to supply the entire
facility with power

Reich searches Garths eyes for understanding Finally

REICH (CONTD)
Vincent installed a duplicate in his
estate Its fully automated powering a
specially designed security system
Vincent intended to convert his estate
into a museum on his death but the world
fell apart first I want you to break in
Major break in and shut down Vincents
nuke so I can take all of Vincents art
into protective custody

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 16

GARTH
(cynical grin)
Protective custody

REICH
Oh hell I could call it stealing but
the truth is itll only be in my hands
until I die and then the next fellow
will come along and protect it

GARTH
You could say the same thing about
gold
(eyes drifting toward the
palets of food)
- while other valuables are consumable

REICH
(smiling)
Yes thats true So what do you say

The shadows across Garths eyes hide deep thoughts

LATER - GARTH AND REICH SIT AT TABLE

enjoying a sumptuous meal Candlesticks wine dishes filled
with ample portions

Nearby the table miniature

REICH
thing is the roof is protected by
surface-to-air missiles SAMs Anything
that comes within a thousand yards of the
place is blown up

GARTH
You tried it

REICH
Hm yes

GARTH

Why not assault it from the side

REICH
The grounds are protected by miniature
battle units — tanks in reality
although they were manufactured to look
like dogs

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 17

GARTH
With just the equipment you have over
there
(gestures crates across room)
» you could take out something like
that

REICH
The entrances are made of six inch armor
plate but we could get past that too
It was proven during the middle ages that
any wall may be breached No the problem
is I dont want any of Vincents
collection damaged

GARTH
Go in a window then

REICH
You make it sound so easy I hope that it
is A window yes The real problem is
not getting in but staying alive once
youre there

(on Garths look)

I have much of Vincents security plans
Some anyway He employed a new kind of
controller a sentient computer system

GARTH
The computer reasons Like a human being

REICH
Here Let me show you

Reich removes a notebook computer from a briefcase beside the
table opens it A picture of DIANA LOGAN 28 appears on the
screen Diana is beautiful yes but behind her eyes resides
an incisive mind and a depth of feeling unusual in one so
young

REICH (CONTD)
Twenty years ago this woman Diana Logan
was dying of cancer Vincent convinced
her to transfer her consciousness into
his one-of-a-kind mainframe which he
named EnCrypt She lives there still
inside Vincents mansion a kind of
apparition within his computer

Garth studies the face It reminds him that once flowers

bloomed that there was hope in the world that people were
young and beautiful He closes the notebook lid

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 18

GARTH
She controls all of the security systems

REICH
Yes As well as maintenance and repair
As I said the Vincent mansion is fully

automated
GARTH
Is she programmed to kill
REICH
Oh yes If necessary
GARTH
How do I defeat her the system I
mean
REICH

You defeat each subsystem separately But
in order to defeat the entire system you
must shut down the reactor Its located
in the basement along with the
supercomputer that controls everything
Obviously this area presents the
greatest challenge

GARTH
Obviously

REICH
There is one additional thing I havent
mentioned yet research that Vincent

was doing the last copy of which may
be in the computer I want you to
download it before shutting the system
off

GARTH
What kind of research

Reich considers not telling him He delays sipping wine
cutting another bite of meat Then

REICH
Vincent was researching weather
control a way to stop the storms — THE

STORM — and return the earth to its
original weather pattern

Garth laughs Redemption It seems absurd

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor

GARTH
You want me to save the world

Reich smiles too

REICH
Yes Could you please Its probably
nothing Vincent is missing and in all
likelihood dead not an indicator for
success is it Still even if his
research is partially completed

GARTH

stands and walks to the window The city lights are fires
consuming furniture and dreams Reich joins him

GARTH
The worlds dying while you play
potentate inside these walls Hell its
already dead What you see out there is
nothing more than the death rattle

REICH
No What you see out there is a thinning
of the herd From ten billion people to
maybe a million a necessary event
and we who are to survive will need a
return to the old weather cycle and
art too if we are to remain civilized
Download the data if you can but shut
down that nuke

The SOUND of a firefight some distance away

REICH (CONTD)
My competitor from the South Bay She
pushes north with an army twice the size
of mine Shes flush with booty from that
shopping center down there the biggest
one in the world Its made her strong
Thats why Im pulling out Major
relocating to the Central Coast after the
storm passes I want the Vincent estate
before I leave And I plan to leave the
moment the storm clears Thats how much
time youll have two maybe three days
After that I blow my way in and take
whatevers not destroyed
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 20

FOLLOW GARTH AND REICH
as they walk past the palets of food and supplies

REICH
I want you to have a good nights
sleep be at your best before you go
in Is there anything I can get you
Companionship maybe

Garth stops before the eight-by-eight-foot cube of food

GARTH
I do nothing until this is delivered
to my camp

REICH
(laughs )
Half The rest when you come out

Garth gestures assent
REICH (CONTD)
(calling)

Sergeant LaPiere

The elevator door opens revealing LaPiere and two former LAPD
cops

REICH (CONTD)
Show the Major to his room then

arrange to have half of this food
delivered to his camp Tonight

INT GARTHS ROOM - NIGHT

The room is splendidly attired subtly illuminated LaPiere
allows Garth in then closes the door behind him

Garth begins to remove his clothes

Movement in the corner of the room A WOMAN steps out of the
shadows She is lovely Her greek gown insinuates that she
possesses nothing else just this garment Clearly this
situation is new to her and shes afraid

WOMAN
Im yours if you want me

Garth doesnt know what to say

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 21

The woman releases the gown and it slips away The strain of
this the humiliation tugs on her expression She steps up
to Garth waiting for him to touch her She will not cry No
But the struggle makes the muscles of her face dance with
restrained emotion

Garth pulls the bedspread from the bed and wraps her in it
She clutches the garment about herself thankful Finally her
brow finds his chest She sobs Garths arms almost close
about her but he hesitates After a moment

GARTH
Who were you

SLAVE
I was a CPA

She looks up Her intelligent eyes search his

SLAVE (CONTD)
Who were you

The question has many answers Finally
GARTH
A civilized man
THE NEXT MORNING
finds the woman asleep beneath the covers and Garth waking
above them He rises from the bed begins to dress
THE DOORWAY - LAPIERE
stands just inside grinning smugly
LAPIERE
Forget that stuff Weve got new clothes
for you You can even shower if you
want
IN THE SHOWER - GARTH

stands beneath the spray of hot water The feel of it reminds
him of clean yesterdays
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 22

exits the shower to find a stack of clothes on a bench and
new boots beneath it He dresses

RESIDENCE - GARTH AND REICH
observe his notebook computer screen

REICH
Have you faced automated defense systems
before Major

GARTH
Many times

REICH
Then you know that Vincent Industries
supplied much of the worlds automated
security and combat systems He made
everything from sentry dogs like
these

INSERT - SCREEN (AND INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

where the SENTRY DOG lopes onto the screen then TRANSMORPHS
into an animated blueprint The animal looks like a large
bulldog

RESUME GARTH AND REICH
looking at the screen

REICH

(continuous )
- to more commercial combat platforms
This particular model can be configured
as a strictly urban house protection
system or it can carry weapons In the
case of Vincents mansion the dogs are
fully armed We tested the perimeter to
find out

GARTH

(disdainful)
Who went in LaPiere

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 23

REICH
No Unfortunately our man was killed You
knew Captain Leon Vega of the Army
Rangers

The name impacts

GARTH
I trained him

REICH
Yes He mentioned you before he died
Inside the Vincent mansion there are
other platforms several that were on the
market and possibly a number that
Vincent was developing but had not yet
finalized Almost certainly youll find
the Ghost

THE GHOST comes up on the screen It indeed looks like a
ghost a floating apparition but it has teeth — weapon
barrels which are shown when the device TRANSMORPHS into an
animated blueprint

REICH (CONTD)
It fires a mini-pulse bolt that can both
stun and kill depending on the
programming Other weapon configurations
are possible Its design was intended to
scare off intruders first so there is a
mercy factor built in

GARTH
Mercy factor

REICH
There are other weapons platform
possibilities Weve listed all that we
know about Vincent Industries equipment
in this notebook computer Take it with
you Familiarize yourself with Vincents
defense mechanisms My advice though is
to expect the unexpected

Garth closes the notebook considering what he has got
himself into

ARMORY - GARTH

marvels at the array of weapons and combat paraphernalia

organized on shelves and attached to walls

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 24

Reich and LaPiere watch from nearby as the ARMORER brings
what appears to be a metal flak jacket to Garth and fits it
to him

ARMORER
Have you worn force-field body armor
before Major

GARTH
No

ARMORER
Im not surprised It was just introduced
during the last days of the Pentagon
Now its battery operated This read-
out

He places a WATCH-LIKE DEVICE on Garths wrist

ARMORER (CONTD)
-- here tells you your count Generally
speaking the armor is good for
approximately a hundred rounds of five-
point-five-six or seventy-five rounds of
seven-point-six-two Grenades and pulse
weapons take a toll of anywhere from ten
to a hundred points depending on the
proximity of impact You follow

GARTH
I follow

ARMORER
Good Now this is a battery pack

The armorer straps a BATTERY BELT to Garths waist

ARMORER (CONTD)
It holds twenty additional batteries
They arent interconnected for reasons of
shorting out or chain reaction You
understand This armor is electrically
operated

GARTH
I get the concept

ARMORER
You must change the batteries between
firefights or whenever a battery becomes
depleted Some batteries may provide
protection past the hundred mark but
dont count on it

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 25

The Armorer takes an M-16 off a table and points it at Garth

ARMORER (CONTD)
(to Reich and LaPiere)
Gentlemen you may wish to stand back
Glancing rounds will deflect

Reich and LaPiere retreat five paces

Garth cant believe hes about to be shot at He steps
forward

The Armorer BEGINS FIRING The ROUNDS HIT GARTH repeatedly
until the magazine empties EACH ROUND HITTING THE BODY ARMOR
CAUSES IT TO FLASH AS IT REPELS THE FIREPOWER

The Armorer switches magazines as Garth angered and
surprised attempts to march forward again and take the gun
from the Armorers hands Garth is again THROWN BACK BY
SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS and then to the floor

The Armorer reloads begins firing again as Garth tries to
get up finally succeeds assaults forward toward the Armorer
as he reloads yet another magazine and begins firing again
throwing Garth back Garth topples behind the table

The Armorer switches to an AK-47

ARMORER (CONTD)
Switching to a larger round

These heavier rounds throw Garth back to the wall MOST
ROUNDS HIT THE ARMOR FLATTEN AND SLIDE TO THE FLOOR WHILE
GLANCING BLOWS DEFLECT LEFT AND RIGHT

ARMORER (CONTD)

(shouting over din)
Its advisable that you seek cover when
being fired upon While armor-deflected
rounds cant penetrate the concussive
force of the round

(changes magazine starts

firing)
-- can disorient and in some cases
render the recipient unconscious I am
avoiding the Majors head area for
demonstration purposes An enemy wont be
so lenient

The Armorer finishes his last magazine and puts the AK-47
down

EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 26

Garth rises shaken and marches for the Armorer who raises
a hand signalling Stop

ARMORER (CONTD)
(big smile)
Just kidding

Garth stops trying to control his anger

GARTH
You son-of-a-bitch you didnt warn me

ARMORER
Major you have just taken eighty direct
hits Under normal circumstances one
would have been enough to kill you How
do you feel

Garth grabs the smaller man and nearly lifts him off his
feet After a moment

GARTH
I feel SWELL

Garth drops the Armorer and surges past as Reich and LaPiere
share a look of amusement

INSERT - THE RECHARGER PACK

in the Armorers hands is tugged open revealing slots that
accept body armor batteries and dials for adjusting the
equipment

INT THE ARMORY - THE ARMORER (SCENE)

EXT VINCENT MANSION MOUNTAINTOP - DAY

The chopper maneuvers carefully to avoid the top of the

around here without being shot at

DIANA
No Youll be taken into custody held
for —

GARTH
The police

DIANA
That is the procedure

GARTH
There is no police

DIANA
So you say

Garth shifts The machine gun follows him servos whining
The statue continues to provide cover

GARTH
Why dont you just turn the machines
off

DIANA

I cant do that

GARTH
Arent you the Chief of Security Arent
you the soul of the machine Why cant
you just stop shooting at me

DIANA
It doesnt work like that

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 56

GARTH
Your mind controls everything doesnt
it

DIANA
Yes but the defensive equipment is

linked to my autonomic nervous system I
can no more stop the defensive units than
I can stop breathing

GARTH
You arent breathing Youre a goddamn
ghost

Diana thinks about that for a second Yes thats exactly
what she is

DIANA
My mind works the same way as when I
was alive Thats why Mr Vincent gave me
this opportunity to remain alive
inside EnCrypt

GARTH
Where is Vincent by the way

Diana turns away considering the question

(SCENE) GARTH
throws the spent battery

The tank gun tracks the flight of the battery into the
darkness

Garth leaps out from behind the statue and lands on the tank

The tank gun barrel tries to find Garth who stands above it
beyond its tracking range

Garth pulls a survival knife begins to pry open the tankss
metal access plate

The tanks treads SQUEAL as it accelerates toward the nearest
unadorned wall Garth hangs on prying with the knife

The tank slams into the wall almost throws Garth backs up
slams into the wall again

Garth clings to the machine gun barrel yanks off the access
plate stabs the knife deep into a row of circuit boards

The tank SPITS SMOKE AND SPARKS DIES
Garth removes the ammo feeder tosses it into the darkness

Sucking for wind sweat cascading from his skin Garth eyes
Diana warily as she slowly walks to the tank

DIANA AND GARTH
study one another for a long moment before

GARTH
If you cant shut the damn things off
maybe you can warn me

DIANA
Warn you

GARTH
You know where everything is dont you
You know which machines are operational
which ones are in stand-by mode which
ones—

DIANA
Really this whole question would be a
moot point if you just surrendered

GARTH

So you can hold me for the police
DIANA

Certainly You have less to fear from

them
(looking back toward the
darkness )

- than me

GARTH
That might be a long wait

DIANA
So you say

GARTH
You might save my life if you briefed
me on what to expect

Diana considers that possibility for a moment Then

DIANA
This is not the pattern of a burglar A
burglar would have taken something and
gone

Garth merely looks at her image as it moves

DIANA (CONTD)
If there really is no police as you
say then youve come to cut the power
and take everything That
(surveys him)
is why I wont help you

GARTH
If I cut the power what becomes of you
DIANA
I will become what you say I already am
GARTH
Death as a blackout Ive feared worse
things
DIANA

Go now Take whatever you find back
there If you go forward you wont
survive

Garth retrieves his rifle slides a fresh battery into it It
HUMS

GARTH
Yeah Ive heard that before too

Diana considers this exchange a moment then DISAPPEARS

order until a woman waits at the end of the gallery

ELAINE is beautiful with long flowing red hair and skin the
color of porcelain Her green-green eyes glow like emeralds
her red lips not tainted by makeup but truly red teeth as
perfect as creation before the end of Eden

GARTH

stands before her He is not wearing torn combat clothes but
a suit styled by future hands

ELAINE
John how Ive wanted to hold you
again

GARTH

Elaine let me take you home

ELAINE
(shaking her head no)
I have a different home now Do you

know what became of me
This is a question he would rather not contemplate

GARTH
I searched for you Elaine I did

ELAINE
There was no food Garth There was
nothing Our son was hungry I kept
waiting for you to come but you
didnt So I went out looking for food
The market was empty There were men
there Garth They raped me Then they
butchered me and took my flesh to their
homes and fed their families with me
This last thing I didnt mind I saved a
childs life At least my body did

Garth can take this story no more

INT GALLERY

Garth snaps awake beside the wall Nothing has changed from

GARTH

advances into the hall The SOUND is closer now a haunting
otherworldly wail

Gath brings the pulse rifle up checks the charge (100 in
green) advances

The SOUND grows louder louder yet increasing in volume and
emotion a noise so terrifying that its existence seems
impossible

A GHOST

floats through the far doorway and turns heading toward
Garth It is the corpse of a man arms and legs dangling
eyes glowing red the wordless wail rising from its throat
GARTH

grins

GARTH
Ah a ghost

Garth brings the pulse rifle up takes his time aiming He
FIRES

The ghost TWISTS IN THE HOLD OF SUCCESSIVE ROUNDS writhing
and bellowing its unearthly artificial SOUND until its
DISGUISE AS A GHOST LOSES DEFINITION AND THE MACHINE BEHIND
IT CAN BE PERCEIVED It begins to falter
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 63

ANOTHER ANGLE - GARTH

is so preoccupied with the ghost that he doesnt see the man-
sized robot roll toward him from behind The robot grabs him
with huge pincer-arms causing Garth to drop the pulse rifle

The robots momentum carries them past the sealed beam which
ACTIVATES YET ANOTHER DIANA 3-D projection

DIANA
Okay guys this is the fun gallery at
least for me These are all portraits
of real people from history
(etc )

Garth writhes in the hands of the robot its STEEL FINGERS
CLOSING ON HIS BODY ARMOR WHICH SPARKS WITH RESISTANCE

Garths single free hand slams against the robots metal
skin without effect

Garth pulls the survival knife rams it into a crevice in the
robot body jerks it snapping off the tip of the blade

The robot turns with Garths splayed body moving for some
dark destination

A last ditch effort Garth slams the broken blade into one of
the paintings as they pass The blade digs deep into the
canvas and is dragged an inch before the robot halts

(SCENE) THE ROBOTS SOULLESS EYES MEET GARTHS

in crystal understanding If the robot continues Garth will
destroy the painting

Moments pass as Garths lungs suck air and sweat cascades
from his brow

The blade moves a millimeter in the canvas flesh a womans
bosom

The robots eyes move to the painting back to Garth
One robot hand relaxes On Garths movement the other

Garth slowly pulls himself from the robots grasp steps
down

While the steel hands are empty GUN BARRELS LOCATED IN THE
ROBOTS CHEST follow Garths every movement

Moments pass Garth reaches for the fallen rifle

The robot watches

Garths fingers almost make contact with the weapon Will he
have to release the knife in order to retrieve the rifle
Garth gives up withdraws his hand and extends a leg
makes contact with the rifle

The robot whirls and accelerates down the gallery its tracks
squealing in retreat

Garth releases the blade and retrieves the rifle brings it
up to shoot

The first round hits the retreating robot as IT WHISKS
THROUGH THE 3-D IMAGE OF DIANA AND HER CHILDREN like an
aircraft through clouds

Garth FIRES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

PULSE BOLTS STRIKE the robot repeatedly It explodes in fire
and wanders off track finally stopping altogether

An unearthly SOUND makes Garth spin around

MORE GHOSTS

float across the threshold of the far gallery each different
in its horrific representation — a child a crone a woman
aman

(SCENE) GARTH

begins firing immediately

So do the ghosts — PULSE BOLTS THAT STRIKE GARTHS ARMOR AND

THE STATUES

are 3-D projections of light carved by an artist to represent
life and projected up from a base Think Kodachrome Some of
the statues are modern and geometric Others are almost
indistinguishable from life — a fawn a waterfall a soldier
in combat lovers holding hands others

A STATUE OF A NUDE WOMAN

Its body armor blown the Rooks chest RECEIVES THE BULLET
ROUNDS like darts through Playdough

Garth EMPTIES THE PISTOLS has no time to reload
The Rook grabs Garths ankles and crawls up his fallen body

Garth plunges his damaged survival knife deep into the Rooks
bullet-pocked chest No effect

The Rooks hands close around Garths neck

Garth slams the knife repeatedly into the machines body
Nothing

Beneath the Rooks flesh bio-mechanical devices ooze and
revolve levers pushing limbs

Garths fingers reach for the railing something to push
against to rise No

The Rooks fingers close about Garths neck
Garth has lost control of the knife which sticks from the
Rooks chest its metal blade fostering sparks inside the

machine

Garth grabs the knife handle pulls loses it pulls again
again finally dislodging the knife

The Rook squeezes Garths neck twisting trying to wrench
his head from his body Garth gags

Garths body armor wrist gauge reads 23 17 14 09

Garth raises the knife and plunges it deep into the Rooks
head

The Rooks eyes go wide then fail

The Rook falls from Garths body tumbles down the steps
bursts into flames

GARTH

gasps for air sucking oxygen into his lungs like water
through a busted dam After several long moments he staggers
to his feet and descends the stairs stepping carefully

around the Rooks burning torso

Diana waits at the foot of the steps

GARTH

Youre on my side now is that the idea

DIANA

Is that all youve come to do steal

Garth considers the question a moment

GARTH

Vincent was supposedly on the verge of a
discovery that would return the earth to

its original weather pattern Do you know

anything about that
No

GARTH (CONTD)

That secret is supposed to be contained

in Vincents computer in you

DIANA

Im not the computer I just live in
it But no Im not aware of anything

like that

GARTH
Can you access the computer

DIANA

There were things Mr Vincent didnt want

me to know business secrets

DIANA
No I cant

GARTH
Maybe I can

DIANA
No You wouldnt stand a chance Let me

THE SHOULDERS and back The goo causes the BODY ARMOR TO
SPARK

Garth checks his wrist read-out

Garth begins FIRING ON FULL AUTOMATIC as he runs

The BULLETS DISPERSE THE CREATURE Goo flies everywhere
Garth reaches the pod first opens the cover smashes the
faceplate

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE CREATURES

amorphous tentacles grip Garth and pull him back

His reaching hand is jerked away from the ACTIVATE NOW
button

Garth bellows in pain as the GOO ABSORBS INTO HIS SKIN White
blotches begin to appear

Garths boot catches a cable line and holds as the creature
pulls on his prone body

Garth reaches for a pen in his pocket Its the miniature
crossbow seen earlier Arms spring out a trigger The bolt
snaps into place with a flick of his wrist Garth aims
aims and fires

THE POD CONTROLLER - THE ACTIVATE NOW BUTTON

is pressed home by the flying bolt

GARTH AND THE CREATURE
are blown back by the explosion

Garth lands ten feet away The GOO IS SLOWLY PROCEEDING UP
ONE ARM changing his flesh killing it Garth rubs it as if
to return circulation but it doesnt help

Garth sees the creature reforming moving toward him He
tries to move but hes been hurt far more than he thought He
sags waiting death

A DAMAGED ROBOT

from an earlier confrontation with the creature surges
forward In its hands a cable whose end has been stripped
revealing naked wires The robot spears the creature with the
cable SPARKS AND SIZZLING FLESH Moments pass as the
CREATURE CONTINUES TO LOSE VISCOSITY sagging finally into
bags of amorphous jelly and then decayed pools of chemicals

Diana APPEARS imperfectly due to damaged projector lenses
on top of the robot which drops the cable

DIANA
Are you all right

GARTH
(coughing)
Im dying

DIANA
No youre not I can save you

GARTH
(laughs - bubbling blood)
No I dont think so
The robot scoops him up pivots and moves for the stairwell
door DIANA PROJECTED ON TOP and seeming to tend to Garth
THE TRACKS OF THE ROBOT

pass over puddles of ooze which cling

EXTINT THE STAIRWELL - (SCENE)

The robot carrying Garth crazily descends the steps
dropping from step to step

Smashes through the second landing door
Crashes through the third

Careens around the corner and through the final door

THE ROBOTS TRACKS

are beginning to SMOKE AND HISS as the creature transforms
the metal

GARTH AND DIANA

almost tumble from the robot as it throws a track and grinds
to a halt

Garths left arm is almost ash

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 116

DIANA
You must get up Get up Get up
goddamn it GET UP

Garth is almost out He looks questioningly at Diana as if
to ask Why

DIANA (CONTD)
Get to the computer John listen to me
you can still live if you just get to
the computer

Garth understands He tries to lift himself from the robots
arms falls back tries again

Garth tumbles to the floor tries to stand but his LEFT LEG
HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO WASTE MATERIAL No living flesh there

DIANA (CONTD)
Focus John Focus on me You can do it

DIANAS IMAGE FLICKERS in the darkness a wavering ghost She
is tethered to the damaged robot unable to go with him

Garth begins to crawl
DIANA DISAPPEARS FROM THE ROBOT and REAPPEARS A BETTER
PROJECTION near the computer where Vincents lifeless body
lays
DIANA (CONTD)

Fifteen feet John Thats all it is

Just fifteen feet
(SCENE) THE CREATURE
surges through the door

Diana snaps around to look as does Garth

The creature too is not what it once was The beast fights to
retain its form and motion but moves forward

Garth tries to crawl faster but cant
DIANA DISAPPEARS from the computer and REAPPEARS at the
robot Standing on its top she directs it to turn around

The remaining track spins the machine around

Garth forces himself to go faster

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 117

Diana commands the robots arms to snap menacingly This is
the only weapon that remains

The creature advances

Garth uses furniture to pull himself forward Hes on his
knees now

The robots arms snap as the creature advances

The robot and creature meet The snapping arms are
meaningless The CREATURE SWALLOWS THE ROBOT as DIANAS IMAGE
WAVERS CRACKLES AND DISAPPEARS

(SCENE) DIANA

REAPPEARS beside the computer

She watches with mute horror as the creature absorbs the
robot rises to its full height and then FLINGS A PORTION OF
ITS MASS AT GARTH

The GOO HITS GARTH just as he rises to push Vincents body
from the couch The body topples onto the floor as Garth
screams in pain

The GOO SETTLES INTO HIS BACK sizzling

Garth loses control of his body collapses to the floor

Portions of his back waist one leg one arm are already
lifeless

DIANA
I cant do this for you You must get up
onto the couch Now NOW
Garth shakes the grogginess away as A SHADOW FALLS ACROSS
HIM
(SCENE) THE CREATURE

its mass increased by conquest has risen to its full height
less than five feet away

Garth rises on one leg as the other drops away from his body
a fallen cigarette ash

One last Herculean effort Garth jumps up onto the couch

The CREATURE FALLS UPON HIM swallowing him whole

(CONTTNUED )
EnCrypt by Richard Taylor 118

Diana gasps in surprise and regret

Garths GOOD HAND JUTS UP THROUGH THE GOO pulls the temple
probe down to where his forehead is located beneath the
creature

The vast computers HUM increases

The outline of Garths body jumps then shakes in death
rattle

Diana throws the full power of EnCrypt into the chair making
contact with the amoebic goo EnCrypts dormant synaptic
power rises to a terrible HUM The creature fries this time
not dissolving but burning Pieces fly away ashes fallen
from a bonfire A BELLOWING MOAN rises from the creature as
it crumbles into hot dust

SLOW DISSOLVE

EXT A MEADOW ABOVE THE OCEAN - DAY
Wild flowers are in bloom The sea wind gusts gently

Garth stands staring out to sea He wears casual clothes
clean carefree

A hand reaches out for him Garth takes it

PULL BACK to reveal Diana Wearing a sun dress and holding a
hat on her head against the wind She smiles

PULL BACK TO REVEAL that this is a television screen in the
EnCrypt computer room

PULL BACK TO THE CEILING THROUGH THE CEILING THEN THE
NEXT AND THE NEXT TO THE ROOF TO THE SKY WHERE THE
STORM IS RAGING AND THE POD SEEDS ARE SWIRLING ABOVE THE
STORM
PULL BACK TO THE EARTH ITSELF SPINNING ON

FADE OUT

THE END
