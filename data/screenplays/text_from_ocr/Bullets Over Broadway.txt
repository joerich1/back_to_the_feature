Bullets Over Broadway
INT HELEN SINCLAIRS APARTMENT - DAY

Sid Loomis and Helen Sinclair are arguing Sid (Helen’s
agent) is trying to convince her to take the part in David
Shayne’s upcoming play

HELEN
You must be joking You want me to
play some frumpy housewife who gets
dumped for a flapper Don’t you
remember who I am Don’t you know
who you represent I’m Helen
Sinclair

SID
Definitely You are definitely
Helen Sinclair I look at you and
say Helen Sinclair But who better
to play that role

HELEN
Under who’s direction Some
novice

SID
He’s the author

HELEN

Of two flops

They talk over one another

SID HELEN
Julian says it’s the Oh JulianJulian Marx I
directors who messed up those do plays put on by Belasco or
projects Sam Harris Not some Yiddish

pants salesman turned
producer My ex-husband used
to say “If you’re gonna go
down go down with the best
of them”

SID
Which ex-husband

HELEN
Oh I don’t know which ex-husband
The one with the mustashe

SID
Listen to me authors are very
often the best directors of their
own work
HELEN
Shes dowdy The ingenue has all
the hot lines Even the female
psychiatrist is a better role

SID
But the role of Sylvia Poston is
the lead

HELEN

Sylvia Postoneven the name reeks
of Orbach’s I do Elektra I do
Lady Macbeth I do plays by Noel
and Phil Barry or at least Max
Anderson

SID
Helen listen to me this is a
major part in a serious play And
let’s face it Helen you have not
been in a hit in a long time Ina
long long long time

HELEN
I’m still a star
(beat)
I never play frumps or virgins

The doorbell rings

SID
You are a star because you are
great And you are a great star
But let me tell you something
Helen in the last couple of years
youre better known as an
adulteress and a drunk and I say
this in all due respect

HELEN
Look I haven’t had a drink since
New Year’s Eve

SID
You’re talking Chinese New Year’s

HELEN
Naturally Still That’s two
days Sid do you know how long
that is for me
(beat)
What is it Josette
JOSETTE
It’s some flowers

HELEN
Well bring them here will you

SID
Helen I gotta tell youthe
offers aren’t pouring in like they
used to

HELEN
(re flowers)

They’re from David Shayne
(quoting the note included
with the flowers)

“As a small artist to a greater

one that you merely consider my

play is all the fulfillment I

require” Hmmmwhat’s he like

SID
I hear he’s terrific A genius
ready to emerge

HELEN
I have to be billed over the title

SID
Where else

HELEN
Approval of the leading man The
star’s dressing room

SID
This is not even a question

HELEN
Approval of all photos of me It’s
still not a very glamorous role but
maybe I could meet with David
Maybe we could go over the script
Maybe there’s a few ways we could
find to brighten her up Hmmm

She picks up a decanter - primed to drink from it

HELEN (CONTD)
Why am I nervous

She drinks
