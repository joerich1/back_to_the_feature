COSTELLOs profile passes in a dark room

COSTELLO (VO)
Years ago we had the Church That

were head-breakers They took over
their piece of the city

EXT SOUTHIE VARIOUS

The neighborhood 1980s We wont be here long This isnt
where Costello ends up Its where he began Liquor stores
with shamrocked signs MEN FISHING near Castle Island
Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard

COSTELLO (VO)
Twenty years after an Irishman
couldnt get a job we had the
presidency Thats what the niggers
dont realize If I got one thing
against the black chaps its this
No one gives it to you You have to
take it

INT LUNCH COUNTER DAY

COSTELLO comes in The shop is one that sells papers
sundries fountain drinksand fronts a bookie operation

YOUNG COSTELLO
(leaning over cluttered
counter)
Dont make me have to come down
here again

close

PROPRIETOR
Wont happen again Mr C

The frightened proprietor hands over money Fifty bucks a
hundred doesnt matter COSTELLO is never the threatener
His demeanor is gentle philosophical Almost a shrinks
probing bedside manner He has great interest in the world
as he moves through it As if he originally came from a
different world and his survival in this one depends on

continual observation and analysis

YOUNG COLIN looks up CLOSE ON his eyes He is fourteen or
fifteen but small for his age Bookish

COSTELLO eyes the proprietors TEENAGE DAUGHTER working
behind the counter He takes a propane lighter and
strangely pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits
for change He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter

YOUNG COSTELLO
Carmens developing into a fine
young lady You should be proud
You get your period yet Carmen

The PROPRIETOR is uneasy COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN
(about 14) staring at the local hero Costello reaches up
above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONTD)
You Johnny Sullivans kid

COLIN nods

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONTD)
You live with your grandmother

COLIN nods

YOUNG COLIN
Yeah

COSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread
and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colins bag

COSTELLO
Get him three loaves of bread And
a couple of half gallons of milk
And some soup

He goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk
in the bag Some soup Costello turns to Colin

COSTELLO (CONTD)
Do you like comic books
Colin nods He adds a couple of comic books

When the PROPRIETOR looks at him he takes out the money he
put in his pocket and gives back half

YOUNG COSTELLO
You do good in school

YOUNG COLIN nods holding the big bag of loot

COLIN
Yes
YOUNG COSTELLO
Thats good I did good in school
They call that a paradox

He gives some money to Carmen

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONTD)
Buy yourself some makeup Keep the
change

Looks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it Colin does
YOUNG COSTELLO (CONTD)
You ever want to earn a little
extra money you come by L street
You know where I am on L street

COLIN nods everybody does

YOUNG COLIN
Thank you

He pushes out with the bags of groceries
The PROPRIETOR can do shit about it

YOUNG COSTELLO watches YOUNG COLIN go off down a slummy
street

INT A CHURCH MORNING 1985-ISH

YOUNG COLIN the good boy the very good boy is serving at

a
funeral Mass Various views of the church Stained-glass
light The altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense

PRIEST (VO)
To you O Lord we commend the soul
of Alphonsus your Servant in the
sight of this world he is now dead
in your sight may he live forever
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness and in your
goodness grant him everlasting
peace

Amen
CLOSE on COLINS face

PRIEST (VO)
May the angels lead you into
paradise May the martyrs come to
welcome you and take you to the
holy city The new and eternal
Jerusalem

A liturgical bell tings
INT THE AUTOBODY SHOP DAY

COSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a

continuation of the philosophical talk the shadowy pacing)

YOUNG KIDS Useful young men YOUNG COLIN three years
older

is among them

YOUNG COSTELLO
Church wants you in your place
What sort of man wants to be kept
in his place Do this dont do
that kneel stand kneel
standI mean if you go for that
sort of thing

YOUNG COLIN the recent altar boy visibly doesnt go for
that sort of thing

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONTD)
I dont know what to do for you A
man makes his own way No one gives
it to you You have to take it
(a beat)
Non serviam

YOUNG COLIN
James Joyce

YOUNG COSTELLO
Him and Lucifer And me
(to the room)
Guineas from the North End and down
Providence tried to tell me what
to doAnd something maybe
happened to them

EXT A REMOTE BEACH DAWN

Rose-colored dawn YOUNG COSTELLO with a pistol executes a
MAN kneeling in the surf She falls on the body of a man who
has just been executed

COSTELLO
Jeez she fell funny

FRENCH moves forward with an axe in his hand

FRENCH

They go about their business
INT THE AUTOBODY SHOP DAY

above We see that only YOUNG COLIN is present

YOUNG COSTELLO
You decide to be something you can
be it Thats what they dont tell
you the Church

MISTER FRENCH is doing books off behind a window of dirty
glass

YOUNG COSTELLO (CONTD)
When I was your age they would
say we become cops or criminals
Today what Im saying to you is
this When you are facing a loaded
gun

very close on COSTELLO holding Colins shoulder

INT QUEENANS OFFICE WAITING ROOM DAY

As COLIN leaves the office looking very satisfied and not a
little saturnine (its not as if he isnt pleased by
recognition and its not as if he wont get revenge on
Dignam) he barely glances--and does not actually see--the
TRAINEE sitting off to one side He sees polished brogues
and walks on

QUEENANS SECRETARY

love with COLIN)

Congratulations

QUEENAN
We cant conceal that youve been a

plea to assault and battery might
make sense

Given your nature

QUEENAN
Youll serve enough jail time to
convince anyone that its no set-
up Youll be on probation The
whole nine yards

DIGNAM

pretended to be a Costigan from

Fair enough

MADOLYN
Sometimes though I want people to

fucking family if he saw me here
with you And I think about this

to keep thingson an even keel

BILLY

COSTELLO

How you going Robert

CHINESE TRANSLATOR
Tops Mr Costello I want to tell
you that at least two of these
gents have machine guns

Malay pirate Costellos gunmen are perched above automatic
weapons trained on the Triad

indicate buyers here

CHINESE GANGSTER

(in Cantonese not

subtitled)
Waiting waiting We almost

think its wise to bring automatic
weapons to a business transaction

The CHINESE GANGSTER interjects --

CHINESE GANGSTER
Ngup Ngup Ngup Ngaw um ming
Kay ngup mutt Yap yap yap I
dont understand What is he
saying

The CHINESE TRANSLATOR translates Costellos statement about
concern

SEVERAL OF THE TRIAD hearing a automatic weapon stupidly
raise their MACHINE GUNS They dont aim them

COSTELLO
For his own good tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids none of us are
carrying automatic weapons because
here in this country it dont add
inches to your dick You get a
life sentence for it
We (but no one else) hear a double click as MISTER FRENCH
cocks a pistol behind his back

CHINESE GANGSTER
(in Cantonese)
Put away that machine gun

The MACHINE GUN is put away

COSTELLO
If these chinks want to nuke Taiwan
any time in this century you tell
them they better shape up fast and
show me one million dollars

The CHINESE TRANSLATOR translates

COSTELLO (CONTD)
What we generally do in this
country is one guy shows up with
the items and the other guy pays
him No tickeeno laundry

COSTELLO gestures and a BOX of PROCESSORS is put on the
floor Opened The CHINESE GANGSTER gestures and a case of

INT POLICE HQCONFERENCE ROOM - NOT MUCH LATER

COLIN has been cleaned up a little by paramedics Hes maybe
had his lip stitched but hes still wearing his bloody
clothes

COLIN

At that time Trooper Barrigan who
I now understand to have been
Francis Costellos informer in SIU
intercepted us in the lobby and
shot Trooper William Costigan once
in the head

(drinks water)
At that time Barrigan retrieved
Trooper Costigans undercover
weapon and shot Trooper Brown as he
was approaching our location I
attempted to subdue Trooper
Barrigan and in the ensuing
struggle was struck several times
with the Walther pistol I was
able to wrestle the weapon away at
which time Barrigan drew his own
weapon and took aim at me I was
able to get off a single shot
striking Barrigan in the head I
then checked for vital signs of
Troopers Brown and Costigan and
discovered that they had expired

COLIN looks up eyes clear perfectly believable As we
transition to the FUNERALbagpipes coming up

She moves away from him without answering MADOLYN walks out
through the cemetery gates COLIN hesitates

INT THE STAIRWAY OF COLINS APARTMENT EVENING

COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine Living the
Beacon Hill dream He climbs the steps slowly He nods to a
neighbor an old lady coming down with her dog (who
incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor and COLIN
briefly seems aware of this) (Dont be afraid to get a bit
French here) He gets to his door and starts to cry and
nearly crumples But he gets the door open He looks up and
sees a gun Behind it stepping fast out of the shadows
DIGNAM Avenging a guy he didnt even like because its the
right thing to do COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has
plastic hospital boots on his feet

COLIN
(accepting it sort of
but only in a COLIN way)
OK

DIGNAM fires Flash groceries fall all over the floor
DIGNAMS FEET step over COLINs body crushing one of a half
dozen croissants and DIGNAM goes down the expensive
staircase leaving the door to the apartment open The
strangest thing happens a rat emerges and begins to eat the
dead mans croissants The rat hears something and runs so
its not in the shot when it
FREEZES
