Swan Song

EXT FOREST FLOOR - DUSK

We are drifting top down across a forest floor Tiny specks
of WILD FLOWER amongst the rich dark soil

Snippets of CAMERON TURNER’S dialogue gently fall around us
a tapestry of thoughts and fond observations

CAMERON (VO)

-Hums when she’s nervous Speaks
in her sleep sometimes Rarely
stubborn deeply kind witty She
loves words The musicality of
language Music Her world’s a
symphony

We tilt up from the soil now and we’re drifting through an
incredible forest like a ghost Rays of dusty sunlight guide
us as we begin to center in on one LARGE TREE

CAMERON (VO)
Sorta giggles when we make love
Remember thinking it was strange
when we started dating Becomes
one of those things you’d miss if
she ever stopped doing it
(overlapping)
-What’s that Mariah Carey song
The Christmas one One of her
guilty pleasures I can hear her
now Singing it as she puts the
lights up on the tree

We arrive at the LARGE TREE and tilt up Its impressive bark
trunk stretches up as far as the eye can see In a continuous
movement we begin to move up it

CAMERON (VO)
(overlapping)

Everything changes when you have a

kid From that moment both of you

are just viewing the whole world

through this completely new lens
(overlapping)

-What’s that Beckett line “The

light gleams an instant then it is

night once more” Is that it

As we rise higher and higher we can just about make out the
SILHOUETTE of a DEAD MAN’S BODY suspended in the upper
branches The overlapping voices and music crescendo to a
cacophony of sound that merges into the sound of a train

CUT TO
INT TRAIN - DAY

CAMERON TURNER (30-ish) sits on a busy train at a
compartment with 4 seats and a table He’s in the aisle seat

Cameron is lost in his NOTEBOOK sketching a very cool pencil
drawing of a man in a subway station floating in zero-g

An AUTOMATED CONCESSIONS CART glides up the aisle It stops
beside Cameron speaks into his EAR BUD

CONCESSIONS CART (VO)
Cameron Turner my man Lemmie
guess Latte oat milk no sugar

CAMERON
Spot on sir And I’1l take an
Echo Bar if you got any

CONCESSIONS CART (VO)
Echo’s my middle name amigo
That’1l1 be all

CAMERON
That’s good Thank you

CONCESSIONS CART (VO)
Alright Payment taken Order
coming up
The Automated Concessions Cart whirs into action Cameron
continues drawing as he waits Moments later we see the
COFFEE and ECHO BAR in the little automated shelf of the bot

CONCESSIONS CART (VO)
Ta-da

CAMERON
Thank you bro

CONCESSIONS CART (VO)
You’re welcome Cam OK good talk
Well see you tomorrow

The Concessions Cart glides off to the next compartment

INT TRAIN - LATER

It is early dusk on the train now Cameron wakes as
PASSENGERS from his compartment leave to get off

Cameron sees a WOMAN (late 20s) coming up the busy train

She’s carrying numerous canvas bags and is on a call arguing
with someone via her EAR BUD She speaks English weaving in
little sentences of French This is POPPY
POPPY (ON A CALL)

Yeah I get that But he’s a

sensitive soul You gotta be

gentle with him OK I know my

brother

Poppy reaches Camerons compartment She gestures to the
empty seats across from him Can I Cameron nods Sure

Poppy shuffles across to the window seat diagonally across
from Cameron placing some of her things on the table

POPPY (ON A CALL) (CONT’D)
Well sorry but that’s just how it
is OK Look I gotta go Bye
Poppy taps her ear bud and the call ends

She looks out her window Endless modern buildings

Cameron takes note of the new arrival She’s unique looking
Incredible eyes Stylish in a hip effortless way

Just then Poppy glances around catches Cameron checking her
out He smiles awkwardly diverts his eyes

Poppy checks Cameron out now He’s handsome with an endearing
shyness She smiles to herself

She takes a book out now and begins reading Cameron steals
another glance at her Wow

CUT TO

INT TRAIN CARRIAGE - LATER

Later Cameron is working on a DRAWING of Poppy sketching
the outline stealing glances at her as he goes

As the train rolls on something unexpected happens

Cameron sees Poppy reach over and turn his Echo Bar toward
her He double takes What the

Out of the corner of his eye he watches Poppy open it break
off a chunk and nonchalantly pop it in her mouth How brazen

Cameron tries to process this as Poppy looks back outside

OK time to assert ownership Cameron rotates the Echo Bar
back toward him breaks off the next chunk and eats it as
he’s looking down at his notebook

Poppy notices him eating it seems to smile to herself

And so it continues

Poppy takes another chunk of Camerons Echo Bar Cameron too
polite to say anything takes the next

They share a glance Cameron looks at her strangely Is this
some kind of weird flirting Poppy just smiles at him

Cam’s finally about to say something when Poppy gets a call
POPPY
Hello Hey Yeah No we’re
pulling into the station now Cool
see you in a bit Alright bye

As the train approaches her stop Poppy gathers her stuff and
shuffles out of the compartment

Cameron shares a final glance with the odd but beautiful
passenger Some balls lady

He gestures to his Echo Bar with a smile

CAMERON
It’s all yours

But Poppy doesn’t take it She just smiles at Cameron as she
walks off Cameron chuckles to himself as he watches her go

CUT TO

INT TRAIN CARRIAGE - LATER

Night has fallen on the train Cameron sits at the window
seat now across from an ELDERLY WOMAN He has skillfully
folded the Echo Bar wrapper into an impressive ORIGAMI
ARMADILLO He sits lost in thought

As the train rolls toward his station Cameron puts his
pencils back into his jacket pocket and finds

His uneaten Echo Bar Unopened
Cue penny drop

CAMERON
Oh my God Oh fuck me
Deep embarrassment as he replays the scene in his head
stealing a stranger’s chocolate like some kind of weirdo

CAMERON (CONTD)
Oh shit No no no

He covers his mouth laughing mortified Smooth The ELDERLY
WOMAN is looking over at Cameron strangely

CAMERON (CONTD)
(laughing)
I’m sorry Excuse me

Cameron is laughing as we cut to

INT STRANGE ROOM - NIGHT

Cameron abruptly opens his eyes in a very dark unusual
looking space bathed in a blue hue

Cameron seems older but it’s hard to tell in this dark place
He has some kind of thin disc on his temple with a tiny light
on it and seems as if he was just re-living that moment on

the train He sits there affected as we hear a WOMAN speak

WOMAN (INTERCOM)
--Cameron

Cameron raises his hand Gimmie a minute As we cut to

INT WEDDING VENUE - NIGHT

A memory of a WEDDING DAY moment with Poppy Camerons
fixing the strap on her wedding dress She looks around at
him and they share a look of total love Married

As we cut back to

INT STRANGE ROOM - NIGHT

Cameron sits in the strange blue-lit room affected by the
memories that are washing over him

CUT TO BLACK

SWAN SONG
EXT TURNER HOME - NIGHT
Present day 10 years after the opening train scene

Cameron now 40-ish sits in a LYFT STEED (A popular self-
driving car service with two front facing seats two back
facing no driver)

Cameron’s Steed is traveling through a Seattle suburb as he
listens to a voice message in his ear bud

WOMAN (VO)
--Look I don’t want to add any
more strain on you Cameron but
with your latest scans showing an
accelerating deterioration it’s
vital that we keep things moving
forward --

CAMERON
Mute

The message stops as Cameron’s Steed pulls up at a middle
class suburban home on the outskirts of Seattle Modern
compact 3 stories

It’s so late that the neighborhood is dead quiet

Cameron sits there outside his house lost in thought

IE TURNER HOME - HALLWAY KITCHEN LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Camerons front door auto unlocks once he grabs the handle
He steps into an open planned kitchen and living area It is
tastefully decorated Mid century modern furniture Lived in

Although we are in the near future you wouldn’t know it at
first glance Books and vinyl records are still revered An
oak wood upright piano sits at one end of the living room

CAMERON
Pig

Cameron is greeted by ELLINGTON an adorable dog lovingly
known as “Pig” He gives him a cuddle then heads to the
fridge We might notice family photos on the fridge door

CAMERON (CONTD)
(to Ellington)
You guys save me some food You
didn’t eat all my food today
INT TURNER HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Cameron tired and battling a headache stops at a door with
“THE DOC” written on it in HAND DRAWN lettering

He quietly pops his head in His son CORY is asleep He’s
an adorable kid Cameron looks in on Cory sleeping for a
moment then turns out the night light

INT TURNER HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cameron comes into the bedroom

We pan around to see Poppy who is asleep in their bed
Cameron kisses her and pads into their bathroom

INT TURNER HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Poppy has placed a piece of paper for him beside their sinks
It’s a drawing clearly the work of Cory

Through Camerons AUGMENTED REALITY (AR) contact lenses he
sees that Poppy has left him a voice message emoji (a little
3D emoji)

The emoji senses Cameron entering the room and comes to life
with her voice message into his EAR BUDS

POPPY (VO)
Child prodigy or future serial
killer Can’t wait for parent
teacher night

Poppy’s emoji’s head morphs into a 3D LOVE EYES EMOJI that
giggles then explodes spraying tiny blue love hearts across
the drawing and sink top

Cameron smiles and picks up Cory’s drawing The AR love
hearts fall off it

It’s an good drawing for an 8 year old A classroom with a
teacher at the front She has a dog’s head and big bulging
eyes “MS JONES” is scrawled at the top

Cameron grins He places Cory’s drawing down propped against
the mirror

He removes two inconspicuous EAR BUDS from his ears They are
beautifully designed as is the compact docking station he
places them into

Next he removes his AR CONTACT LENSES and places them into a
second docking station A charging light comes on
Cameron looks down at his left hand His finger is twitching
slightly He looks up at himself in the mirror as he gets a
sudden sharp migraine bolt to his temple
And another
Camerons vision blurs now and everything sways He holds on
to the faucet but can’t steady himself He drops to one knee
and collapses onto the tiles
His body seizes up and he’s out cold
Some excruciating seconds pass as we wait
Then Cameron comes to with a sharp inhalation of air
He is disoriented as he regains awareness of his
surroundings He looks out to the bedroom Thankfully Poppy
has not woken up
He manages to reach out and quietly pull the bathroom door
closed so that Poppy won’t see him if she wakes He lies

there rattled trying to calm his breathing

FADE TO BLACK

EXT SPEEDBOAT - DAY

Cameron is on a speedboat He looks up ahead as a boat motors
along a choppy sea manned by an expressionless fit-looking
man in his 30s This is RAFA

A couple of miles behind them the mountainous coast Way up
ahead an arresting FORESTED ISLAND juts out from the sea

This is BARRA ISLAND

EXT BARRA ISLAND - JETTY - DAY

Cameron and Rafa are walking up a wooden jetty Cameron looks
up at the steep incline of the isolated island

EXT FOREST PATH - DUSK

Cameron and Rafa ascend a path to an impressive modern

Scandinavian style BUILDING nestled in the forest looking out
over the sea
EXT BARRA HOUSE - ENTRANCE AREA - DUSK

Standing at the entrance to greet Cameron and Rafa is a
smartly dressed professional-looking woman This is DOCTOR
JO SCOTT (60s) She smiles at the new arrival

JO
Welcome to Barra House Cameron
Good to meet you in person
(Cameron nods)
Come in

Jo leads Cameron along an impressive entrance hallway that
opens out into the heart of the facility

JO (CONTD)
This is our main living area

The decor is modern but lived in homey Double height with
an incredible view of the arresting landscape outside

Cameron stands beside Jo taking in the space and view

INT BARRA HOUSE - JO’S OFFICE - DAY

Cameron sits across from Jo with an AR CONTRACT in front of
him We might notice words like “Memory Access” or “Non-
disclosure” or “Transference Of Rights”

Jo keeps her eyes trained on Cameron as he studies the
contract

JO
I know that some of these concepts
are uncomfortable Just remember
that if you decide not to proceed
at any point in the evaluation
process he never leaves this
facility

Cameron looks up from the AR contract at Jo

CAMERON
And there’s no way he gets this
thing again

JO
As outlined we modified the
relevant strands of his DNA to
prevent that from happening

A beat Cameron shuts his eyes massages his temples thinks

CAMERON

-And what happens to him if I

decide not to do this Do you

just

Jo cuts in before Cameron can say something like kill him

JO

He goes to sleep that night

unaware doesn’t know a thing

This is clearly an uncomfortable thought for Cameron He
looks out at the dramatic landscape surrounding them

Jo continues off screen
JO (0S) (CONTD)
-We’ll be calling him Jack for

now If that name’s OK with you

Cameron just looks at her

INT BARRA HOUSE - DUSK

Jo stands with Cameron in a long hallway as a heavy CENTER
PIVOT DOOR opens to reveal a stairway down to a BASEMENT
AREA Sensor lights fade up to reveal the stairway

INT BARRA HOUSE - BASEMENT AREA - DUSK

Cameron follows Jo down the stairs The natural light cuts
off at their backs as the huge door closes behind them

At the bottom of the stairs is a curving hallway This part
of the facility feels more minimal sleek

Cameron and Jo make their way down this curving hallway Jo
stops outside one of the doors

JO
This is the control room

She pushes the door open and gestures for Cameron to enter

INT BARRA HOUSE - CONTROL ROOM - DUSK

Cameron steps into the room It has an impressive internal
glass window through which we can barely make out a large
dark room beyond

DALTON sits at a desk facing the glass with a few AR
screens in his vicinity

JO
And this is Dalton

Dalton stands with a nod to Cameron and a friendly smile

DALTON
Welcome Cameron

CAMERON
Hey

JO

Dalton’s a psychologist and our
head technician here

Cameron nods to Dalton but his gaze wanders to the dark room
Reflections on the glass make it hard to see anything

Jo studies Cameron as he tries to peer into Lab One

JO (CONTD)
And that completes our team

Cameron looks back around at her surprised

CAMERON
It’s just three of you here

JO
Three humans Our AI systems do the
work of about fifty people All
the good stuff’s under the hood

Jo smiles at Cameron She’s hard to read
Cameron’s gaze wanders to the room beyond again
DALTON

Before we let you in we’ll need
you to disable the cameras in your
contacts and your watch

Cameron resists this idea a beat but gives in and nods OK

CAMERON
OK Disable cameras

An AR CAMERA APP screen appears asking if he wants to disable
both smartwatch video and contact lens video

Cameron slides his thumb across his index finger to confirm

DALTON
Thank you
JO
So shall we go in
INT BARRA HOUSE - HALLWAY - DUSK
Jo and Cameron are back out in the curved basement hallway
They stand outside the next door beside the Control Room
Jo pauses before entering then steps into Lab One inviting
Cameron to step inside
INT BARRA HOUSE - LAB ONE - DUSK
Cameron steps into the tastefully designed space A huge
floor to ceiling LED WALL looks like a real window to a
spectacular surrounding landscape

Cameron edges into the room Sensor lights softly fade up
illuminating his face more and more with each step

Camerons eyes are trained on something across the room He
edges closer his heart racing

JO
Molecularly regenerated Mapped to
your DNA Cameron Turner to the

molecule
Now we reveal what Cameron is approaching

Lying unconscious in a recliner chair is an IDENTICAL MAN to
Cameron This is JACK

Cameron is breathless as he moves toward his double Jo
watches him inch closer as the lights fade up fully

Cameron is terrified and mesmerized all at once Jo studies
him as he stands within touching distance of his duplicate
taking him in

CAMERON
Is he dreaming

JO
Not yet
(beat)
Go ahead Cameron He can’t wake

Cameron tentatively reaches out lifts Jack’s hand studies
every inch Those are his exact hands Incredible

Now he gently places Jack’s hand down and studies his face A
scar behind his ear Every wrinkle Jack’s eyelids flicker

Cameron looks down at Jack a long beat his mind racing
He diverts his eyes now shakes his head

Jo looks into the Control Room at Dalton sensing that
Cameron is struggling

CAMERON
I’m sorry
(beat)

I can’t do this
EXT BARRA HOUSE - NIGHT
Night has fallen Jo stands at an upstairs window She is
very still watching Cameron walk off with Rafa back through
the forest path in the trees
EXT WATER’S EDGE - NIGHT
Back on the mainland Cameron walks from the boat to a self-
driving BLACK JEEP waiting for him headlights on

EXT FENCE - NIGHT

Cameron gets out of the BLACK JEEP as a heavy PRIVATE FENCE
slides open On the other side a LYFT STEED waits

The Steed senses Cameron approaching In perfect sync the
interior lights fade up and the door glides open

CAR ASSISTANT (VO)
Cam Good evening to you sir --
EXT VARIOUS ROADS - NIGHT
The Steed drives along various roads Feels like a long
journey The Steed glides quietly fast but controlled
INT LYFT STEED - NIGHT

Cameron is in the Steed Through his AR Contact Lenses he
sees a collection of interactive screens in his vicinity

The screens feel tactile and 3D The internet feels beautiful
and seamless like a global design consensus has been reached
that ascribes to the Dieter Rams school of design

Jo is leaving him an instant text-to-voice message

JO (V0O)
Listen I know what a momentous
decision this is for you But
just Remember that the second
you tell your wife that you’re
dying your opportunity to do this
is gone

(beat sighs)

Look there’s someone I want you to
meet Please call me

Cameron sits there staring out the window

INT TURNER HOME - KITCHEN LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

It is pouring rain outside Cameron is lying on the couch in
the living room He is looking over at Poppy and Cory sitting
at the kitchen table doing homework

CORY
But why do they call it goosebumps

POPPY
--Cos of geese When you pluck em
they got these little bumps where
the feathers used to be

CORY
Cool

POPPY
You know the French for it
(Cory shakes his head)
Frisson It means shiver

CORY
Free Sawn

POPPY
Oui Parfait Very good

As Cameron watches Poppy and Cory we dip down the audio and
just focus on him

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

The rain has gotten even heavier outside Cameron looks at
himself in the mirror He looks very sick and very alone
INT TURNER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Next morning Cameron and Cory sit at the breakfast table
Poppy is at the sink putting her breakfast away

Cory’s drawing is on the table between them Cory holds a
VIDEO GAME DEVICE He is playing his game Nothing is said at
the table for a beat

CORY
-Can I have your pencils

CAMERON
Oh so you’re eyeing my pencils
now

Poppy smiles to herself one ear on the conversation

CORY
Uh-huh
CAMERON
(amused)

Yeah The same set I’ve had for
twenty-two years

CORY
You ain’t using ‘em

CAMERON
“Aint” When did we start saying
“aint”

CORY
You don’t use them since Andre
died

Cory keeps playing his video game but the words “Andre died”
have dropped like a bomb in the room clearly hitting an
emotional chord for Poppy and Cameron

Cameron looks over at Poppy at the sink a beat then back at
Cory stuck

INT CAMERON’S OFFICE - DAY

ON AR VIDEO - ALEX Cameron’s boss speaks to him from his
OFFICE Alex is a stylish man 30s

Cameron jots notes as Alex lectures him

ALEX
Cam what’s with you lately Look
I know you’re an artist and this is
painful for you I get it But this
is a health-focused organic tea
were designing not some fucking
Ayahuasca brew

Cameron chuckles but doesn’t respond He just continues to
scribble notes We reveal that his ‘notes’ are just a cool
pencil drawing of a guy with a large cactus for a head

ALEX (CONT’D)
Look when you follow with what the
clients wants you kill it you
know So just play ball OK
(beat)
Hello Earth to Cameron

Cameron holds up the little doodle drawing for Alex to see
Alex smiles amused They’re friends

ALEX (CONTD)
Asshole

CAMERON
Bye Alex

ALEX
Bye Cam Fix the design

Cameron nods Alex ends the call and disappears A hovering
camera auto turns off its light and flies over to Cameron

Cameron places his hand under the hovering camera It senses
his hand’s presence and drops into it He brings the device
to his wrist and it magnetically snaps to his watch

Cameron starts eating goldfish crackers as he browses online
He holds one down for Ellington who gratefully devours it

Cameron seamlessly transitions into his workspace now to work
on the design for the packaging of the organic tea company

A new message appears from Jo taking him out of his stride
He minimizes his array of screens and sits there glum as a
memory emerges

INT TURNER HOME - KITCHEN - 6 YEARS AGO (MEMORY) - DAY

6 years ago Cameron Poppy and her twin ANDRE are at
the kitchen table Camerons painting in his moleskin

Andre has BABY CORY on his lap helping him to eat
breakfast Poppy and Andre are mid sibling-style debate They
occasionally dip into little bits of French as they speak

POPPY
That is cloning by the way

ANDRE
-No no no no no Technically
speaking it’s not The article
said it’s not It’s ‘regeneration’
or something

POPPY
It doesn’t matter what you call it
Andre It’s still weird And I
don’t care how good they say the
tech’s gonna be you’d know it
wasn’t a real person in seconds

ANDRE
Look I’m just saying
hypothetically speaking what if it
actually was possible What if they
did actually work it out

POPPY
They won’t Andre You can’t copy a
human being

ANDRE
(sings)
Mais arrét Hypothetically
Cameron

CAMERON
No thanks I’m staying waaaay out
of this

Everyone chuckles Andre grins keeps pressing Cameron

ANDRE
Oh come on Wimp
(keeps pressing)
Come on

CAMERON
Nothing like a good death chat
first thing in the morning

Everyone chuckles

CAMERON (CONT ’D)
(beat)
»-I mean I dunno We’re all gonna
go right It’s part of life

Andre pretends to snore Cameron laughs They smile at each
other Clearly good pals

CAMERON (CONT ’D)
Ok ok

Poppy abruptly speaks up

POPPY
Hey if Mum could be sitting here
right now with us And we couldn’t
tell She was indistinguishable
Yes Yeah Screw the ethics Id
take it Ok In a heartbeat

Poppy suddenly finds herself unexpectedly choked up Cameron
and Andre see it

A quiet beat But Poppy quickly resuscitates the mood

POPPY (CONTD)
That said if they happened to
delete her fondness for yacht rock
I wouldn’t be devastated

Cameron and Andre chuckle

ANDRE
Hey what about her waddle dance

CAMERON
Noooo We love the waddle dance
Come on

They laugh as Poppy remaining seated does an impression of
her mom’s silly dancing they all remember well Cameron and
Andre join in with the dancing impression Cory giggles We
focus on Cameron smiling laughing

CUT TO

INT TURNER HOME - HOME OFFICE - DUSK

Back to the present with Cameron sitting at his desk A
sudden surge of anger He punches his desk Hard It hurts

We read the message from Dr Jo Scott on his AR screen Can we
meet please

Cameron looks at the message sighs

EXT DOWNTOWN SEATTLE - PIER - DAY

Cameron and Jo sit on a bench at the end of a downtown pier
It’s a boatyard heavy industrial sounds surround them

CAMERON
I can’t lie to my family any more

JO

Look I know how you’re feeling
but there is no lie

(beat)
When the memory of this process
gets wiped Jack wakes up that day
at home as Cameron Turner And no
one knows Not even him It’s the
only way this works A clean swap

CAMERON
You can’t tell me there’s zero risk
of something going wrong here

JO
Getting your appendix removed
carries a risk

CAMERON
And getting your appendix out is
legal It’s not some experiment out
on some island
(beat)
--How many others are out there I
want to know

Jo takes a beat to answer this question

JO
You’11 be our third

Cameron looks out at the water Hardly reassuring

JO (CONTD)
This will be as common as a heart
transplant within a few years
(beat)
»Come back and spend a week with
him before making your decision

CAMERON
It’s not just my decision My wife
needs to know

JO
Either you decide that your wife
would want this which requires
secrecy or you decide that she
wouldn’t and tell her you’re dying
Either way you’re making a decision
for her

Cameron has no retort but Jo can feel him slipping away

JO (CONTD)
Listen the woman you’re about to
meet has no idea she’s a duplicate
And neither does her daughter her
mother or her friends So where’s
the lie

IE LYFT STEED REAL ESTATE AGENCY - DAY

Cameron sits in a Steed looking across at a REAL ESTATE
AGENCY The ground floor is mainly glass with large digital
billboards above it advertising their range of properties

A REALTOR WOMAN is inside behind a desk She is KATE (30s)
Cameron gets out of the car makes his way over As he
crosses the street we get a look at the city around him The
cars the buildings the near future of it all

INT REAL ESTATE AGENCY - DAY

Cameron enters the agency Kate looks up smiles

KATE
Oh hey there Mr Turner right

We watch Cameron watch Kate studying her closely as she
browses through properties
EXT TURNER HOME - EVENING

Later Cameron pulls up in a Steed and walks toward his home

INT TURNER HOME - HOME OFFICE - EVENING

Cameron sits at his desk On AR screens he’s looking up ‘How
to tell a loved one that you are dying’ As he sifts through
the depressing content he hears the door close downstairs
Poppy is home He takes a breath Time to face the music

CAMERON
Ok

INT TURNER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Cameron sits at the top of the stairs looking down at Poppy
at the piano with a recording setup and headphones on
recording herself sing a melody

Cameron watches her a beat readies himself He makes his way
downstairs and approaches the piano

CAMERON
Hey

POPPY
Oh hey

Cameron taps his ear Poppy smiles and hits a button to
unmute the audio The music fills the room

It’s a beautiful soulful piece using samples of herself and
her students singing with a little beat Cameron bops his
head Loving it

POPPY (CONTD)
Yeah

Cameron nods Yeah Poppy smiles

CAMERON
Is Cory at Jessie’s for dinner
POPPY
Yep Back at eight You taking a
break
CAMERON
Yeah

Cameron nods He gives Poppy a gentle squeeze on the shoulder
and goes to sit on the couch behind her She seems to sense
that something is on his mind

Slowly we drift in on Cameron as Poppy comes over sits
beside him Just as she sits Cameron gets a dizzying bolt of
vision blur for a second

Poppy rests her head back against the couch closes her eyes
They slouch together letting Poppy’s music wash over them

We slowly drift in on Cameron as he readies himself

But Poppy breaks the silence first

POPPY
Hey so I think we’re gonna get
Doctor Herbert for the ultrasound
Still waiting for them to confirm
but it’s looking good

Poppy places her hand on her stomach

CAMERON
Yeah That’s good We like her

POPPY
(nods beat)
Bracing yourself for sexy bowling
ball bod

Cameron chuckles but talk of the pregnancy right now is
destroying him He looks out the window to the back garden

Poppy reaches over and takes his hand places it on her
stomach with hers

POPPY (CONTD)
-Still can’t believe it We’re
gonna fall in love with a new
little person again Seven
months

Cameron is unable to speak trying to hold it together Poppy
senses that something’s up gently questions him

POPPY (CONTD)
What’s up Cam

CAMERON
Nothing I’m good It’s just

Time seems to be crawling second by second Tension
building Cameron looks at his amazing wife Can he tell her

CAMERON (CONTD)
Sweetie I

POPPY
(suddenly very worried)
Cameron
A long beat But no Cameron manages to smile
CAMERON

-It’s just a new little person I
think it’s just sinking in still
yknow

Poppy looks at him as he tries to hold it together Seeing
him emotional makes her emotional

POPPY
Aw Come here

Poppy leans over hugs him close to her He berates himself
for backing out as she speaks softly

POPPY (CONTD)
Listen I know it took me a minute
with everything And I know we
haven’t been us for a while But
this baby’s gonna be good for us
We’re gonna be OK Alright

CAMERON
Yeah

POPPY
We’re gonna be good

EXT BARRA HOUSE - FOREST CLEARING - DUSK

A WOMAN (30s) sits out on a bench in a beautiful forest
clearing behind the facility

Rafa hangs back as Cameron approaches the bench

CAMERON
Hey Mind if I sit

We reveal that it is KATE the original version of the
duplicate Cameron met in the Real Estate office the day

In a few moments you’re going to
go under

CAMERON
OK I just I think I

Before Cameron can utter another word his eyelids fall heavy
and he’s out cold

CUT TO

A BREATHTAKING FEAST OF SOUND AND IMAGES EMERGES
It is EVERYTHING

Tiny rapid snippets of Camerons birth and childhood and
adolescence and adulthood zip by

Everything is intertwined and non-linear augmented by an
immense soundscape

The images build in intensity as the sound rises and rises to
a deafening cacophony

CUT TO

INT BARRA HOUSE - LAB ONE - EVENING

The visual soundscape suddenly stops as Camerons eyes open

It is now dusk in Lab One 6 hours zipped by in the blink of
an eye Things are slowly coming back into focus for Cameron
as his chair tilts back to an upright position

Jo approaches him Cameron looks at her dazed as she hands
him a glass of water

CAMERON
Thank you

Cameron looks across at Jack who is still unconscious Rafa
is tending to him

CAMERON (CONTD)
---So he has everything

JO
Even the memories you store deep in
your subconscious

Cameron considers this strange unnerving thought

EXT BARRA HOUSE - FOREST PATH - EVENING
Cameron and Kate walk along a forest path They drink tea

A DRONE BOT with a soft light gracefully glides past them
carrying a delivery of vegetables and dry goods

CAMERON
All those memories they’re not
just mine They’re my wife’s
they’re my son’s Not part of
some experiment I just wish I
could talk to her

KATE

When they sent “Me 20” back
Seeing my mom look into her eyes
and not know it wasn’t me Seeing
her talking to my daughter I
mean

(smiles a beat)
And then when they wiped her
Knowing she was no longer in on the
lie My guilt faded pretty quick

Cameron looks at Kate now Yeah Kate nods They stop at a
clearing Cameron takes in the moody but beautiful
surroundings

CAMERON
We share an oncologist you know

KATE
Doctor Karasuma

CAMERON
Yeah

KATE

The patient before me was a patient
of hers too

Cameron considers this They stand in silence for a while

walk on together

That’s normal As it progresses
the system will test any point in
time all the way back to birth

It’s vital for the process that you
do your best to stay in the

Cameron nods and starts to mentally prepare himself again A
couple of deep breaths then he closes his eyes as we cut

smile emerges as he sees Poppy’s name and number written on
the back

against his other freckles His hand trembles slightly

We hold on Jack as we hear Jo off screen

For the time that you are in this
facility that freckle is the only
place on your entire body that
isn’t identical to his If you
get confused you find that freckle
and you’1ll know who you are OK

Jack looks up at Jo trying to deal with the overwhelming

be woken up as a fucking clone

--Poppy’s the world best sleeper
When she’s tired she’ll just drift
off in seconds Out like a light

JO
Poppy speaks French

JACK

Yeah She still says the
occasional French word Like she’1l
say “bonne nuit” or “quoi de neuf”
“cest pas possible”

Jacks words but she keeps things moving business-like

JO
Good Talk to me about your
parents’ relationship

INT BARRA HOUSE - LAB ONE - DAY

Mid interview in Lab One The LED WALL bathes everything in
an intense purple hue

Cameron sits across from Jack almost uncomfortably close Jo
sits diagonally between them also close Both men seem
tired This feels more like an interrogation

Dalton silently observes from the Control Room

JO
Keep going Cameron Test him

Cameron considers his next words

CAMERON
Franklin Herbie

Jack thinks a second then nods as a memory comes to mind

JACK
Very first day I met Andre Up on
the Franklin rooftop that night
The Herbie story

JO
Elaborate please Jack

JACK
dust like Poppy Andre was one
of those rare people you’re
instantly comfortable around A few
hours after we met Andre and I are
up on the rooftop having a smoke
Just me and him And he tells me
this old Herbie Hancock story

INTERCUT WITH

EXT CITY ROOF TOP - (MEMORY) - NIGHT

Cameron and Andre getting stoned on a rooftop overlooking the
city Intercut this story so we flip between Andre telling it
on the rooftop and Jack telling it back in Lab One

JACK (VO)
SoO Herbie’s playing with Miles
Davis It’s a huge night crazy
pressure Ton of important people
there And the place is jumping
Miles is on fire they’re all
cooking

(MORE )

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
And right at the peak of one of
Miles’ jams Herbie hits this bum
chord I mean it’s way off And he
can’t even hide it He’s dying up
there And he’s standing there
playing just waiting watching for
Miles’ wrath But Miles Nah

INT LAB ONE - THAT MOMENT
Back in Lab One as Jack continues

JACK

In an instant he just
Maneuvers Glides right into
Herbie’s “wrong” chord Makes the
note right And they keep on
playing

(beat)
And I’m standing there looking at
Poppy’s twin brother this guy I
just met that day Man

Cameron watches Jack reminisce fondly As we cut back to

EXT ROOF TOP - IRONWORKS (MEMORY) - NIGHT

The memory of Cameron and Andre getting stoned on a
rooftop overlooking the city They chuckle

JACK (VO)

Hadn’t had a best friend like
Andre since I was a kid

INT LAB ONE - THAT MOMENT

Cameron is lost in the memories of Andre his eyes diverted
Jo looks around at him

JO

Another memory Cameron and Andre are leading Poppy into
the living room with her eyes covered

Cameron leads Poppy across the room while Andre covers her
eyes Poppy reaches out and touches the piano

POPPY
Aww you got me a piano

She opens her eyes and sees that it’s her late father’s piano
from their old house back in London She is blown away She
gets up and hugs Andre

another soul as we cut
EXT STREET - 10 YEARS AGO (MEMORY) - NIGHT

Jo pushes on keeping up the pressure

JO
Have you talked to your wife about
that dream

Jack shakes his head Cameron struggles with the territory
they are entering

JO (CONTD)
Why not

JACK
She didn’t leave the house for
the better part of a year Slept in
the guest room most of that time

INT TURNER HOME - 18 MONTHS AGO (MEMORY) - NIGHT
-A memory from 18 months ago Cameron stands outside an
unused spare room The door’s ajar Poppy is standing inside

looking out at him She looks pale and numb

They’re talking in whispers so Cory doesn’t hear a tension
between them

CAMERON
But how long do you think you’re
going to sleep in there love

Poppy’s holding back tears

CAMERON (CONTD)
--I’m just trying to help

POPPY
I know But I need to be alone

Cameron nods OK Poppy pushes over the door leaving Cameron
shut out in the hallway He seems hurt lost He almost
knocks on the door but decides against it As we cut

INT BARRA HOUSE - LAB ONE - DAY
Back to Lab One as Jack continues answering

JACK
-It’s not really subject matter
we enjoy getting into

JO
How did Poppy sleeping apart make
you feel

JACK
Alone I guess But I just worried
about her I missed her

JO
Did you resent her for it

Cameron and Jack both glare at Jo What the fuck

JACK
She lost her twin
(beat)
She never felt good about him
getting that motorcycle She blamed
herself for not protesting more
But he was going to get the bike

Jack trails off Jo doesn’t give him long keeps going

JO
You’ve mentioned how well Poppy
has progressed with her therapist
over the last few months But you
never went to see anybody

We drift closer and closer to Cameron now He shuts his eyes
clearly struggling with the questions The atmosphere in the
room around him intensifies by the second

JACK (0S)
-No

JO (0OS)
Did you talk to someone after your
parents were divorced

JACK (0S)
I was five

JO (0OS)
So you’ve never been to see a
therapist

JACK (0S)
-No

JO (0OS)
And you can’t talk to Poppy about
this dream that you keep having
(pushing)
It’s been 2 years Why haven’t you
gone to see somebody

Cameron eyes closed blurts out a quiet answer

CAMERON
I don’t know

Jo and Jack look over at Cameron A sudden pin-drop silence
in the room

JO
--Cameron

Cameron opens his eyes realizing that he spoke out loud

CAMERON
Sorry I’m sorry

JO

Jack looks over at Cameron studies him

Jack feels eyes on him looks at Cameron

Jack sees that they’re doing the identical thing smiles
After a while Jack speaks

JACK

POPPY
Oh my God you’re pregnant Poppy

Jack chuckles at her accent Cameron is deeply suffering as
Poppy and Jack reminisce

Were drifting in on Cameron as they continue to talk closer
and closer to him as his anxiety rises by the second

JACK
God Remember that feeling

Deep terror Ecstatic excitement

JACK
We’re barely out of the doc’s

Cameron moves for the door now

CAMERON (CONTD)
You know what fuck this

Jack moves and blocks his way

JACK
No bullshit You stay right here

A scuffle starts to break out

JACK (CONTD)
This is real and you know it You

The two men slam into the wall grabbing each other

JACK (CONTD)
Poppy said if she couldn’t tell if
her mom was indistinguishable Well
here it is Indistinguishable And
you won’t go through with it
because you’re too fucking selfish

Cameron shoves him with a flash of aggression

JACK (CONTD)
Yeah Come on Do it Do it

Rafa enters Lab One to intervene but Jo stops him with a
stern look and a hand up Leave them

Cameron shoves Jack now and moves forward inches from Jack’s
face He speaks with venom in his voice

CAMERON
You won’t leave this place I’m
going home and I’m telling them
everything Everything

JACK

(seeing red)
Yeah I bet you will Because it’s
always about you She’s been trying
to talk to you for I don’t know how
long and you’ve been shutting her
out because deep down inside you
feel like she abandoned us

Silence Both men are taken aback by the words that just came
out of Jack’s mouth A beat

CAMERON
-I’ve never thought that

JACK
Yeah you did

CAMERON
I’ve never once thought that

JACK
You did

Cameron suddenly looks woozy on his feet Jack watches
worried now props Cameron up like two twelfth-round boxers

JACK (CONTD)
-Hey hey hey hey hey It’s
OK It’s OK Breathe breathe

Jack gently places a hand onto Camerons shoulder But
Cameron regains his awareness and shrugs it off

He turns and walks out of Lab One Jack watches him go
instantly regretting the escalation

Jo shares a look with Dalton

chance to make everything right and

want to I know

shelf together

He gets out of the Steed and walks across the street as the
Steed takes off As he walks up the path toward the house a

sudden migraine hits him and his vision starts to fail

Cameron is suddenly woozy He tries to grab something but
there’s nothing to grab

His knees go weak and he falls to the ground with a thud
If Poppy or Cory look out the window now they’ll see

milliseconds from the end

Confusion sets in as he looks around him sweaty and pale

JO
If you stay and have another
seizure without supervision you
could die in front of your family

Cameron sits there utterly torn

His deep pain turns to a sudden rage Cameron slams his fists
into the seat of the car repeatedly

to stop this

I know this isn’t as we planned it
but you’re ready Jack Don’t think
of these two weeks as a test

it himself is another question entirely

before bed We see Jack’s hand reach out with a book for
Cory they’re both chuckling giddy

Cameron studies the Viewing Room screen shaken by the
visceral reality of seeing Cory look right into camera

CAMERON
-This is the only feed
(Rafa nods)
--I’d like to be alone

Rafa stands and joins Dalton at the door

DALTON
Call if you need anything

As everyone leaves Cameron stands in front of the screen
Jack is helping Cory to open the book We see a handwritten
quote on the inside cover

JACK (0S)
My mom gave me this on my tenth
birthday She wrote a quote see
Wanna read it

CORY
(reading)
-You think your pain and your
heart-break are un-pre-ce-dented
in the history of the world but
then you read James Bald-win

JACK (0S)
Good Know what it means

As Cory and Jack keep talking we dip the audio and slowly
push in on Cameron as he watches

INT BARRA HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Slowly we drift through the dim curved hallway of Barra like
a ghost as the sound of rain gentle emerges

INT BARRA HOUSE - VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT

Later Camerons in the viewing room watching Jack’s POV on
the screen Jack’s at home in the back garden with Poppy

ON VIDEO - Poppy and Jack sit on the PATIO They’re mid
conversation Poppy talks with a heavy heart

She holds open a copy of a book A paragraph is underlined
and some pencil notes in the margins Andre’s handiwork

POPPY

I used to kill Andre for doing this
to our books when we were growing
up Now I’m pouring over every word
he underlined Listen to this one

(beat reads)
“He thought he heard her call
carried in the wind a song bird
trying to beat its wings He
thought he heard it echo around the
dead streets and remembered New
Years Eve when he was 16 her
fingerprints still glowing like sea
stars on the palm of his hand”

Poppy stops reading composes herself

POPPY (CONT’D)

-God I wish he’d found love

before the end you know
(smiles stays strong)

A few months ago going through

these books like this would’ve

floored me His thumb smudges
(beat fighting tears)

I’m gonna have Andre around me

forever We both are Somehow

I’m finally breathing again but I

feel like I’ve lost you Cam

She takes a moment We see Jack’s hand coming out to gently
wipe a tear from her face

POPPY (CONT’D)
You keep yourself so busy doing a
job you hate It’s like you’re not
here I’m not saying you’re fully
to blame We’re both in this

Cameron is watching every second from Jack’s POV Poppy looks
into camera right into his soul as she continues

POPPY (CONT’D)
I know I checked out for a while I
know that scared you And I’m so
sorry for that I am But since
Andre we’re like two strangers And
we can’t do it like this anymore
(beat)
(MORE )

POPPY (CONTD)
Hearing you say the words “I hit
my head” the other day I couldn’t
lose you Cam I couldn’t live

Cameron watches as Poppy’s words hit him deep She continues
forcing herself to stay strong

POPPY (CONTD)
So this is me telling you that I’m
done with the silence now We start
communicating again and we fix
things
Cameron looks at Poppy with total love as she wipes her eyes
JACK (0S)
Everything you just said P
Everything
We dip the audio down now Cameron just sits there a wreck

FADE TO BLACK

EXT BARRA ISLAND - JETTY - DAY

Next morning Cameron walks alone a tiny figure dwarfed by
the surrounding landscape of Barra

INT BARRA HOUSE - KATE’S BEDROOM - DAY

A few days later Cameron sits by Kate’s bedside She’s at
death’s door Cameron looks at his friend smiles at her
gives her a supportive squeeze on the arm

CAMERON
(remembering)
-Oh hey I made you something

He takes out a pencil drawn “GET WELL SOON” card He waits
for her to chuckle but she just looks at it stone faced

KATE
That’s really insensitive

Cameron’s joke has utterly backfired He’s mortified
CAMERON
Oh shit I’m really sorry Kate I
thought it’d be I didn’t Shit

Suddenly Kate breaks into a cackle

KATE
Your face Oh my god Your face

She’s laughing now as Cameron realizes he’s totally been got

CAMERON
Oh you mother -- Shit

KATE
It’s funny It’s good

They laugh together now Kate erupts into a coughing fit a
pained look suddenly on her face Cameron holds her hand
just being there for her

CAMERON
You’re OK I’ve got you I’m here

EXT BARRA ISLAND - SHORELINE - DAY

Cameron stands with Jo Dalton and Rafa at the island’s edge
Rafa empties Kate’s ashes into the sea ripples emanating out
in perfect rings Cameron silently stares out

Later Cameron sits in the same place alone now looking out
to sea as night encroaches A lonely haunted figure He
flicks Kate’s lighter on the flame dances in the wind

Days later It’s dark and lonely in the viewing room The
screen reads “LENS FEED UNAVAILABLE”

Cameron sits there on the floor shut out a ghost

CAMERON
But he’s been taking out the
contacts more and more not just
when he goes to bed

JO
Well he doesn’t have to wear them
all the time They make him feel
uncomfortable

(MORE )

JO (CONTD)
He feels bad for you But he also
feels uncomfortable having his
family watched

CAMERON
I don’t give a shit about his
comfort That’s my family

JO
What you’re feeling right now
Cameron is normal

CAMERON
No it is not Something is wrong
For the last couple of days I feel
it Something is off

through it’s normal He’s fine

CAMERON

Cameron walks off certain she’s wrong

EXT BARRA HOUSE - FOREST CLEARING - DUSK

Next day Cameron stands at the edge of the forest battling
with a growing inner turmoil

He turns back to face Barra In an upstairs window he spots
Jo and Dalton having a heated argument He crouches behind a
tree and watches them like a hawk

INT BARRA HOUSE - VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT

Cameron is glued to the screen It’s very quiet in the
viewing room almost eerie

ON VIDEO - Jack is standing in the en suite bathroom looking
in on Poppy who is in their bedroom music on sitting with
her back to him on the bed folding laundry

Now Jack looks at himself in the mirror looking right down
the lens

Cameron watches as Jack edges closer to the mirror staring
at him Jack seems disturbed Cameron mutters to himself

CAMERON
-What’s up with you

He watches as Jack looks down at his hand for a beat then he

looks back up and takes out the contacts

The viewing room becomes dark In the bottom corner the
screen reads “LENS FEED UNAVAILABLE”

Cameron sits there shut out again certain that something is

very wrong

EXT TURNER HOME - NIGHT

Across the street from the Turner home The neighborhood is

eerily quiet Slowly we drift closer a voyeur

Jack spots Cory playing his video game again under the table
Abruptly he gets to his feet moves with purpose

JACK (CONTD)
OK That’s it Give me that

He grabs the video game out of Cory’s hands smashes it
against the wall Cory and Poppy’s mouths drop open

POPPY
What the hell Cameron

Ellington begins barking Jack gets right up in Cory’s face
roaring at him grabbing his arm tight There’s a darkness in
his voice we’ve never heard before

JACK

When are you going to listen huh
POPPY

Cameron
JACK

Stay out of this

POPPY
You’re hurting him

JACK
Shut the fuck up

Ellington is barking manically now Poppy is completely
floored by what Camerons just said He screams at the dog

Cory tries to shrug Cameron off Poppy’s getting to her feet

POPPY
Cameron

CORY
Get off me

JACK

fucking manners you little shit

CORY

Ellington is over now barking at Jack trying to get him to
stop Jack turns and kicks him full force in the ribs

INT BARRA HOUSE - CAMERONS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Back to Barra that moment as Cameron jolts awake from the
nightmare One of those hyper realistic dreams that lingers
after you wake He buries his head into his covers screams
into them His shoulders heave up and down

CUT TO

Cameron stares at Jack on screen who is looking in the
bathroom mirror a menacing look on his face

CUT TO

Later Cameron sits in the dark on his bedroom floor wrapped
in his blankets He is shaking utterly disturbed

INT BARRA HOUSE - HALLWAY JO SCOTT’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Cameron still sweaty quietly pads along an upstairs Barra
hallway He reaches Jo’s office waits a second listens No
sign of anyone He pushes the handle quietly slips inside

He goes straight to the desk He rifles through the drawers
finds a set of AR glasses He puts them on and taps his
thumbs A notification comes up “ACCESS DENIED”

Cameron clenches his fist nearly punches the desk But
restrains himself He roots around in the drawer again
desperate Something catches his eye

A SMART WATCH with a broken strap He picks it up and the
Barra logo flickers on He studies it thinking

EXT BARRA ISLAND - JETTY - NIGHT

Cameron approaches the speedboat down at the jetty He moves
frantically paranoid that someone could be on to him He
fumbles in his pocket for the broken watch finds it Once he
has it out he holds it up as he walks toward the boat

As he gets closer with the watch he is greeted by the
incredible sight of the boat’s lights turning on Cameron
looks at it adrenaline pumping

He looks back up toward Barra now scared someone will have
noticed or heard No sign of anyone but no time to wait He
starts to untie the boat as fast as he can

Cameron is in the back of a Lyft Steed Homeward bound Heart
racing We slowly drift in on him as the car speeds through
the streets

EXT TURNER HOME - NIGHT

Cameron pads toward his house nervous Readies himself He

gets to the door He takes a deep breath then moves his hand
toward the handle as we hear the door unlock

INT TURNER HOME - NIGHT

Cameron comes inside removes his shoes and takes everything
in the smells the feeling of the rug beneath his feet

He slowly moves through the ground floor and waits at the
base of the stairs a moment This is it

INT TURNER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Cameron quietly edges up the stairs At the top he inches
past his open bedroom door He can practically hear his own

heart thumping

He pads up the next set of stairs now headed for his office

INT TURNER HOME - HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

Cameron very quietly edges into his office and carefully
closes the door behind him

The lights fade up and what greets him is a nice surprise
The unloved office of the last couple of years has been
transformed It is starting to resemble an illustrator’s
studio again like the old days

Jack has been drawing again Sketches paintings and works in
progress are dotted around the room A number of drawings
feature his character who floats in zero-g And the framed
birthday drawing of Andre is now hanging up on the wall

He sees evidence of Jack and Poppy hanging out up there the
night before - records out wine glasses

INT TURNER HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Poppy is fast asleep Jack beside her has just woken He
thinks he hears a creak in the floorboards Listens

INT TURNER HOME - HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

Cameron goes to his desk finds a spare pair of AR GLASSES in
the drawer puts them on The AR screens wake up

Cameron scans through his messages All seems to be fine
Jack and Poppy communicating just as he and Poppy used to A
GIF Poppy sent him of the moment they told Cory he was going
to be a big brother

Cameron takes it all in

He spots the ORIGAMI ARMADILLO from when he first saw Poppy
sitting on the desk He picks it up looks at it fondly

Just then the door opens Cameron jumps swings around in
his chair He sees Jack there

Then Jack holds his hand up Shhh
Jack quietly steps into the room closes the door behind him
An ultra charged beat as they stand there in silence

But as Jack stands there looking over at Cameron it becomes
clear that he has no anger just empathy

JACK
It’s OK Do what you need to do

Cameron looks at him nods

INT TURNER HOME - STAIRS - NIGHT

Cameron quietly pads down the stairs behind Jack Both men
are trembling At the bottom they round the corner Just then
Ellington bursts in through the dog flap and scurries into
the house When he sees two Camerons he screeches to a halt
Cameron and Jack freeze in their tracks No one breathes A
tense beat Ellington double takes but rather than bark he
turns on a dime and bolts into the back garden like a rocket
Cameron and Jack breathe again

Jack heads to the store room under the stairs Cameron nods
They look at each other Jack whispers emotional

JACK
Hey Just Be careful Please

Cameron nods I will Jack steps into the store room They
share a last nod of trust and Jack shuts the door behind him

Cameron strips down to his boxers and t-shirt He takes a
deep breath readies himself then moves for the stairs
INT TURNER HOME - STORE ROOM - NIGHT

Jack paces listening to the creak of Cameron walking
upstairs Every worst case scenario pulses through his mind
INT TURNER HOME - CORY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cameron pads into Cory’s room He notices his OLD PENCIL SET

deep breath and gently shakes Cory’s shoulder

INT TRAIN CARRIAGE (MEMORY) - DAY

Were back in the memory from when Cameron and Poppy first
spoke on the train The moment when he looked up from seeing
Poppy’s name and number written on the back of his drawing

He’s looking up the aisle at her as she looks up and catches
eyes with him They hold each others’ gaze Time seems to
slow as they smile at each other across the train A wordless
conversation

It’s like somehow at that moment they both know that this is
the start of everything After a time we cut back to
INT TURNER HOME - BEDROOM BATHROOM - SAME

Poppy has drifted back to sleep Cameron lies on his side
facing his beautiful girl tears in his eyes

INT TURNER HOME - STORE ROOM - NIGHT

Jack sits there an emotional wreck Just then he hears
footsteps above him someone coming down the stairs

CUT TO
Out in the living area Cameron comes down the stairs and
stands there He looks around the house one last time So
Many memories Goodbye house
He has done what he came to do He turns to go back to the
store room for Jack Just then Ellington cautiously comes
inside through the dog flap and approaches wagging his tail

Cameron looks down Seeing Ellington melts his heart

CAMERON
Pig

Cameron crouches down to Ellington Now he crumbles He hugs
and kisses his dog close to him his shoulders heaving

Jack watches through the from the store room welling up

Nothing is said for a while Nothing needs to be This is

Jack turns and gets out of the car We stay with him as he
watches Cameron drive off

beautiful lonely image of his floating character in a vast
landscape Watching him work in this setting is moving She
sits next to him on the bench

JO
As of this morning he’s

comfort He looks back out to the surrounding landscape

CAMERON
Good Good Thank you Doc

Jo smiles emotional now He smiles at her

JO
Thank you

They both look up and watch a flock of starlings overhead a
beautiful murmuration

Jos next words come from somewhere deep in her being

JO (CONTD)
It’s hard to be left behind

This sentence hangs in the air around them as they share a
silent moment together Jo brings her gaze back to Camerons
moleskin drawing
