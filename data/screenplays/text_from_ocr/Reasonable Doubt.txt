EXT PLAYGROUND - FRANKLIN PARK - BOSTON - EVENING

Nestled at the edge of 648 acres of rugged woodland KIDS
play on rope swings timber slides and rugged wooden see-
saws MOTHERS and NANNIES sit and talk together on benches

A young man CECIL ACKERMAN 24 pale skin red hair is
watching from beyond the playground fence His eyes follow
the little girls some of them no more than 6 years old as
they swing to and fro

He sees a small girl EMMA 7 toss a ball It goes through
the fence and rolls out onto the path Emma looks to her
NANNY 19 but she is deep in conversation Emma slips
through a gap in the fence and goes after the ball As she
bends to pick it up she clumsily kicks it The ball rolls
away down a sloping path into the woods and Emma goes after
it

Cecil looks at the Nanny At the other Mothers Nobody has
noticed Emma’s absence Cecil pushes back from the fence and
casually walks away

EXT FRANKLIN PARK - EVENING

Emma’s ball bounces off the path and into the bushes Emma
follows it Pushing though the foliage She sees her ball
and --

Cecil picks it up Emma looks up at him He smiles

CECIL
Is this your ball

Emma takes a small step back Nods

CECIL (CONT’D)
What’s your name

EMMA
Emma

CECIL
Emma That’s a pretty name

Cecil holds the ball out to her
CECIL (CONTD)

Don’t be afraid Here Come and
take it

Emma takes a small step forward She reaches for the ball
Doesnt fully commit

CECIL (CONTD)

Emma takes another step toward him and AN OUT OF FOCUS FIGURE
appears behind Cecil A HAMMER (wrapped in plastic) rises
above him and --

EXT FRANKLIN PARK - EVENING

Emma just standing there Unhurt She has tears streaming
down her face Cecil is gone Nanny drops to her knees and

settling on the ground A single drop of blood rolls down
its plastic surface

EXT BOSTON MUNICIPAL COURTHOUSE - DAY

Establishing shot of the surprisingly warm looking brick

MITCH’S VOICE
The defense would have you believe
that circumstance is what put the
accused in this court today

INT COURTROOM - COURTROOM - DAY

(ADA) Assistant District Attorney MITCH BRODY mid 30s
stands before the Jury He’s Boston born and raised but he’s
softened the accent There’s a slight scrappy edge to him

A fighter
JUDGE McKENNA 60s a stern looking woman presides

MITCH

Honesty or in the defendants
case a lack of honesty - that’s
why we’re here today Call it
character Call it backbone Call
it common decency Everyone has a
choice

(beat)
Lack of education opportunities a
broken home low employment rates
are nothing but excuses to hide
behind when you’re deciding who you
want to be in this world

(beat)
Neither fate nor society put
Francis Mulligan inside the house
of Gloria Mitchell on the night of
the fifteenth Neither fate nor
society told him to tie her up -
shove a gun in her face - and take
her belongings That was his
choice

Mitch looks at MULLIGAN 25 Irish tats up each arm
Mulligan stares back with total disrespect

MITCH (CONTD)

The defense would have you walk in
his client’s shoes Well I have
I’m from Dorchester

(this gets peoples

attention)
It’s a shit hole Nobody’s saying
it’s not But that’s where I’m
from - not who I am

Mulligan looks down Confronted by an alternate life

MITCH (CONTD)
He’s not the victim here So if
youre going to put yourself in
anyone’s shoes - put yourself in
Gloria Mitchell’s

Mitch walks back to his seat and sits beside fellow ADA
STUART KEMP early 30s doughy not what you would call
handsome

STUART
Nice close DeNiro
MITCH

STUART
Not who I am It was golden

JUDGE MCKENNA
The jury will adjourn to deliberate
a verdict

Mitch Stuart and the defense settle into their chairs to
wait A defense attorney leaves to take a call

MITCH
You got any snacks I missed
breakfast Rachel’s on total bed

STUART
I told you I’m on a diet

MITCH
Youre telling me you don’t have
one chocolate bar hidden in there

Mitch grabs Stuart’s briefcase and digs Finds a Snickers
bar Grins “ah-ha” Stuart looks busted

STUART
That’s for emergencies In case my
blood sugar drops

Mitch’s phone buzzes Reads “IT’S TIME”

MITCH
It’s time Oh shit I gotta go

Mitch puts down the Snicker’s bar and starts to stuff papers
into his case

STUART
But the jury’s still out

MITCH
It’s a guilty verdict Five years
Parole after two

STUART
How do you know

MITCH
One - Judge McKenna’s soft on the
educationally challenged and nobody
got shot
Mitch picks up his case --

STUART
And two

MITCH

(smiles--)
I don’t lose

(to Judge McKenna --)
I’m sorry about this your honor
I’m going to have to leave my
esteemed associate to finish up

JUDGE MCKENNA

free to go

Mitch turns to walk away -- then reaches back and snatches up
the Snicker’s bar

True -- but with the dead kid’s
blood and hair on his clothes --
not to mention the bloody tools and
plastic sheets we found in the back
of the van -- weve got enough to
charge him You guys need to
decide if it’s enough to convict

Mitch looks through a window and sees --

TOBIAS

sitting
room

LEVY
handcuffed in a chair in the middle of an interview
Levy is an unassuming man Hair thin His clothes

taken as evidence He is wrapped in a large blanket Hands

stained

with dry blood

MITCH
He looks scared

KANON
You think the guilty ones don’t
This guy’s staring down twenty to
life for this one alone

MITCH
What do you mean “this one”

KANON
I ran some keywords through the
database -- tools torture male
victims It flagged a string of
unsolved homicides We’re pulling
the files now

MITCH
You think this guy’s a serial
killer You don’t even know he did
this one

KANON
Listen kid I just work the
evidence Every detective here has
a caseload this high -- and only 24

hours in the day to work ‘em -- so
if it turns out this guy clears up
five unsolveds -- that’s a good day

in my books
Kanon starts to walks away

KANON (CONTD)
Tell your boss he’ll get everything
weve got when we get it okay

MITCH
What if he really is just a “Good
Samaritan” Did you consider that

Kanon just waves -- doesn’t look back There is a commotion
down the hall A PRIEST is there arguing with OFFICERS

PRIEST
Then let me talk to somebody in
charge

Officers beckon to Kanon who sighs and approaches the Priest

Mitch -- alone now -- steps closer to the window Looks in
on Levy who just sits there Unmoving Calm

PRIEST (0S) (CONTD)
You must have made a mistake
Tobias wouldn’t hurt a fly I’m
not leaving until I see him

Mitch looks down the hall at the Priest and Kanon talking

PRIEST (CONTD)
Hasn’t he been through enough

Mitch looks back at Levy We see Mitch’s reflection in the
glass Their faces line up over each other like Mitch and
Levy are interchangeable

The place is quiet A few early drinkers Mitch is sitting
at the bar nursing a beer BARTENDER (GIO) 40 friendly
slides him a shot of Scotch

MITCH
What’s this

BARTENDER
Hair of the dog

MITCH
I’m not hungover

Mitch rubs his hand through his hair Needs to talk

BARTENDER
So why the face like a slapped
ass

Bartender pops the cap off a Bud Lite and hands it toa
customer Writes on their tab

MITCH
Buddy of mine did something stupid
and he doesn’t know how to fix it

GIO
What are we talking - stupid stupid
or illegal stupid

MITCH
Lose everything - career wife
freedom - kinda stupid

BARTENDER
Does anybody else know your friend
did this thing

MITCH
No

BARTENDER
Then shit man - whatever it is -
tell him to say twelve Hail Marys
and take it to the grave

MITCH
Somebody else is being blamed for
what he did

BARTENDER
Ouch

MITCH
He only has two choices right
Fess up or let the guy take the
rap And either way he’s screwed

Mitch downs the Scotch

BARTENDER
Personally - and I’m an asshole -
I’d still choose the Hail Marys and
throw in a prayer that he doesn’t
get a prosecutor like you

MITCH
What do you mean

BARTENDER
This may come as a surprise to you
Mitch but some prosecutors lose
cases from time to time

Somebody further along the bar signals to Bartender He
walks away

BARTENDER (CONT’D)
Yes pal What can I do you for

Mitch sits there The wheels of his mind turning He gets
up and throws a twenty on the bar Hurries out the door

Mitch and Stuart take seats across the table Take files
from their briefcases Levy just stares at Mitch

MITCH
Mister Levy we’re going to ask you
a few questions about the night of
the 4th If you could answer as
clearly and accurately as possible

LEVY
Are you my prosecutor

MITCH
Yes Yes I am

LEVY
I’m innocent

Levy hold’s Mitch’s look

MITCH
Then you’ve got nothing to worry
about
LEVY
Do I have your word on that Mitch
MITCH
Absolutely
Levy sits back
STUART

Can you tell us where you were
earlier that night Mr Levy Were
you out drinking

LEVY
I don’t drink I finished work
went to group then I went for a
drive

Mitch notices Lundgren write that down Or try His pen is
out of ink

MITCH
Group

Mitch slides Lundgren a pen

LEVY
I help out at support groups and
church meetings

MITCH
I see And the drive

LEVY
Just something I do Helps me
sleep Haven’t you ever taken a
drive at night Mitch

MITCH
That’s beside the point I’m not

Uncomfortable

LEVY

CUT TO

INT JONES’ OFFICE - DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

Mitch and Stuart are sitting opposite Jones

JONES
What do we know about the victim

MITCH
Cecil Ackerman

Mitch hands Jones a rap sheet with a photo of Ackerman on

MITCH (CONTD)
A registered sex offender Two
counts of statutory rape Been out
on parole for three months

JONES
So a real loss to humanity

MITCH
So far there’s no connection
between him and Levy

STAURT
Other than Levy’s hammer in the
back of his head you mean

JONES
Tell me about the murder weapon

STUART
Weapons Plural Coroner couldn’t
be exact but the wounds are
consistent with the type of tools
and machine parts found in the back
of Levy’s van

MITCH
Though they also found significant
amounts of motor oil and grit in
the wounds which corroborates his
hit and run story

STUART
True but the vic’s DNA and blood
were all over Levy’s clothes --
inside his van

MITCH
All of which is explainable by
transference when he lifted
Ackerman into his van

STUART
Or when he murdered him

FLASHBACK
BAM Mitchs Escalade hits Ackerman
BACK TO SCENE

STUART (CONTD)
Levy has three counts of aggravated
assault

MITCH
At a time when his family had just
been murdered in a home invasion
He hasn’t had so much as a parking
ticket since

STUART
That doesn’t negate the fact that
he took a tire-iron to three men
and hospitalized them

JONES
What’s concerning you Mitch

MITCH
I don’t see motive

STUART
Ackerman was a pedophile

MITCH
Levy’s daughter was murdered not
raped It doesn’t fit
Secretary knocks and enters
SECRETARY
Terry Lundgren just called There
was a 911 call fTape’s on its way

Mitch looks worried

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE —- DAY

Secretary slots the cassette into the machine Mitch and
Stuart sit opposite Jones

SECRETARY
Somebody called in an accident
twenty minutes before Levy was
picked up When the ambulance got
there there was no body

JONES
Let’s hear it

Secretary presses play Static fills the room We can feel
Mitch stop breathing as --

MALE VOICE (0S)
911 what’s your emergency

MITCH’S VOICE (0S)
There’s been an accident

Mitch watches the room for any hint of recognition

MALE VOICE (0S)
What’s the location

MITCH’S VOICE (0S)
It’s Darby Street Just south of
20th Hurry

MALE VOICE (0S)
What’s your name sir

MITCH’S VOICE (0S)
Please hurry He’s hurt real bad

There is a click and the call ends Secretary presses stop

JONES
Thats it
SECRETARY
You want me to play it again
MITCH
No
JONES

The location matches Levy’s story
but we can’t rule out the
possibility that he made the call
himself

STUART
Is there any way we can find the
caller

MITCH
He used a payphone

Stuart looks up from documents that came with the tape

STUART
How do you know that

JONES
Because we’d have the man’s name if
it wasn’t

Mitch breathes

JONES (CONTD)
Okay the tape’s potentially
damaging but not conclusive Maybe
it was a crank maybe not but if
we can’t find the caller then
defense can’t Hell it could be
anyone in Boston It sounds like
Mitch Where were you that night

Stuart and Secretary laugh Mitch smiles
JONES (CONTD)

Bottom line Do we have enough for
a conviction

MITCH

Without motive I say no
JONES

Stuart
STUART

Levy was caught - pardon the pun -
red-handed We have physical
evidence a documented history of
violence no alibi and his public
defender is the kind of guy Mitch
eats for breakfast

Jones weighs a decision To prosecute or not to prosecute
Mitch says a silent prayer and --

JONES
Charge him Murder one

Mitch’s shoulders sink Jones gets up and leaves Stuart
and Secretary gather papers and the tape Stuart pats his
shoulder

In the case of the people versus
Tobias Levy your client entered a
plea of not guilty Does he wish
to change that plea here today

LUNDGREN
He does not your honor

JUDGE MCKENNA
Very well Defense may go ahead
with its opening statement

LUNDGREN
Thank you your honor This case
is nothing more than a huge
misinterpretation of the facts

CUT TO

INT COURTROOM - COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

The sun is low outside the windows The CORONER is on the
stand There are blow-up photos of tools from the back of
Levy’s van on display

MITCH
You examined the body Doctor In
your professional opinion what was
the cause of death

CORONER
Blunt force trauma to the skull

MITCH
Do you know what caused that
trauma

CORONER
The back of the skull was badly
crushed so its hard to narrow it
down to any one item but some of
the marks seem consistent with a
hammer found in the suspect’s van

MITCH
You said “seem” consistent

CORONER
That’s correct

MITCH
Your report talks of abrasions and
impact wounds with motor oil and
grease in them The defence I’m
sure is going to argue that those
wounds indicate a car ran Cecil
Ackerman over and that the rest is
a misinterpretation of the
evidence

CORONER
The accused is a mechanic who used
his van to transport old parts to
and from the wrecker’s yard If I
remember correctly there was an
axle leaf springs suspension arms
inside And the interior was
covered in grease and motor oil
So any type of violent struggle in
that environment could have caused
those wounds and left that trace
evidence

MITCH
I see And did you identify any of
those parts as things he used

CORONER
There was blood on a lot of things -
- it might be easier to say which
one’s he didn’t use

This gets a reaction from the jury They look at Levy
Disgusted Like he’s a monster Mitch breathes He’s not
swayed the Jury one inch

MITCH
No further questions your honor

carrying Ella

RACHEL
Bit late for coffee isn’t it

She looks over his shoulder Sees a photo of Tobias Levy -
years younger than the man we know - happier

RACHEL (CONTD)
Is that him

MITCH
Four years ago This is before his
family were murdered in a home
invasion He was forced to watch
and then left for dead

Mitch pulls out a picture of Levy with his wife and daughter

RACHEL
That’s horrible Did they catch
the killer

MITCH
He was gunned down in another home
invasion the next night

RACHEL
Is that what made his snap

MITCH
That’s the general consensus

Mitch sips his coffee

RACHEL
Here I know you’re working but
can you take Ella for a bit I
need to take a shower before bed
I smell like milk and my hair feels
like straw

Rachel hands him Ella He cradles her in his arms
MITCH
Does mommy smell like milk because
of you Does she
Ellas eyes sparkle as she looks up at him She grips his
finger with her tiny hand Mitch takes a big sigh This

DR EVELYN BROWN 50s professional blind since birth who
is sitting calmly on the stand

JUDGE MCKENNA
Your witness Mr Brody

Stuart leans in to Mitch

STUART
Piece of cake The jury has no
idea what she’s been talking about

Mitch takes that onboard and --

MITCH
I’m not very familiar with your
field Dr Brown and I’m sure
neither is the jury

Brown looks toward Mitch Even behind her black glasses we
sense her staring at him with some sense of recognition

It gives Mitch pause He coughs

MITCH (CONTD)
Just how accurate is forensic
linguistics

DR BROWN
Extremely

Mitch stands Begins to pace

MITCH
But not perfect

DR BROWN
Perfection doesn’t happen in
science

Her head follows him as he moves Listening

MITCH
On a sliding scale of one to ten
then

JUDGE MCKENNA
(to Lundgren)
You might want to object
counselor The witness’ field is
not on trial here

Before Lundgren can respond

MITCH
Ill withdraw the question your
honor

(MORE )

MITCH (CONTD)
You stated earlier that the caller
was genuine - and by that I assume
you mean he was reporting a real
accident

DR BROWN
Correct

MITCH
And you can tell this just by
listening to his voice

DR BROWN
It’s more complicated than that
but - yes

MITCH

Can you tell us anything else about
the caller

DR BROWN
Probably white Medium build
He’s from the south of Boston but
he’s tried hard to soften the
accent - again not unlike yourself
counselor You’re from where -
Dorchester

MITCH
That’s right

DR BROWN
The caller had a strict Roman
Catholic upbringing - so there’s
probably Irish in there - which we
can tell by an almost inaudible
prayer he mumbles while the
operator is talking I’m sure he
didn’t even know he did it himself
And he’s cool under pressure which
we know from the way he gives no
personal details and had the
forethought to use a payphone even
in his heightened emotional state
All of which tells me he has either
a legal or criminal background
None of which matches Tobias Levy

MITCH
Legal or criminal That’s quite a
spread

DR BROWN
Actually the psychological traits
for both professions are
surprisingly similar

MITCH
So in your professional opinion is
it even in the realm of possibility
that Tobias Levy made this 911 call
himself - to establish an alibi

DR BROWN
No It is not

The Jury trades nods of understanding Stuart drops his pen
on the desk No idea what’s going on Judge McKenna just
stares at Mitch

The courthouse is emptying The trial over THE PRESS are
gathered before Lundgren on the steps From the way he holds
himself you’d think he won the case on his legal skills

LUNDGREN

(to the reporters)
It seems that Tobias Levy was not
the only Good Samaritan in this
trial Despite Mr Logan’s initial
reluctance to get involved due to
being out on parole he finally put
his own comfort aside and did the
right thing

REPORTER 1
What about the wounds on the body

LUNDGREN
The prosecution’s case was founded
entirely on a gross
misinterpretation of the forensic
evidence

Mitch sees Levy standing to one side Away from the
limelight Mitch approaches him

MITCH
Mr Levy I just wanted to
congratulate you and wish you all
the best

They shake hands

You told me if I was innocent I’d
have nothing to worry about

MITCH
Yes I did

Levy pinches the filter off a cigarette and drops it onto the
steps He lights the rest of it with his Zippo

MITCH
You go back to your life

Levy SNAPS the Zippo closed again Something about the
lighter draws Mitch’s attention

almost blow the Levy case and get
yourself disbarred and now you’re
trying to prove he’s the Boston

What have you got so far

MITCH
All these men were murdered with
what the pathologists thinks were
tools The first took place eight
months after Levy’s family was
killed He’d already had a run-in
with the law after hospitalizing
those three men so lets assume he
needed time to get up his courage
again

So he kills Bob Smith

But why Was it random A loss of
control I don’t think so I

in common

With no shoes on And his eyes He

perjured myself -- you left the
scene of an accident manipulated a

I know It’s bad But all we need
is proof Levy can’t be retried
for Ackerman but if I can get
evidence that he killed the other
men I can cut us both a deal
What you said under oath - what I
did - that all goes away

Doyle nods -- it sounds logical --

DOYLE
So what are you thinking

MITCH
We need to get inside his house and
look around He targeted those
men He tortured them He may
have overlooked something that
links them to him

MITCH
We’re stepbrothers -- our parents

KANON

Was he blackmailing you Had he
had enough of what you were doing

didn’t do this Tobias Levy did
it

hammer

KANON
Using your hammer

MITCH
Yes He broke into my house and
stole my tools

KANON
There were no other prints on the

That’s because Levy put it there

KANON
It has two types of blood on it --

MITCH
I’m being framed

KANON

-- and by your own admission we can
now link you to three victims

MITCH

Jesus Christ - can you think
logically Why would I do this
What’s my motive And if I was the
killer why didn’t I crucify Levy in

court

He was the perfect

scapegoat

KANON

You tell me

Mitch SLAMS the table with his cuffed fists

Because

MITCH
I’m innocent

Kanon just sits and looks at him Mitch breathes

MITCH (CONTD)

Okay Listen to me There’s a

about saving yourself than your own
flesh and blood

LEVY
NO

MITCH
Youre lying

Mitch continues to inch forward Goading Levy
to turn the gun away from Rachel onto him

MITCH (CONTD)
Admit it

LEVY
He never should have been out of
prison It was the system’s fault

MITCH
This isn’t about the system It’s
about you If you were a man you’d
have died first I know it -- and
youknow it

LEVY
(screams )
There was nothing I could do

Mitch is almost to Levy now

Willing him

MITCH
Bullshit You just dont have the
balls to kill the one who deserves

Levy ROARS in pain Swings the gun away from Rachel and
stabs the barrel into Mitch’s chest Eyes blazing with
murderous anger
Mitch stops
Rachel’s breath stops
LEVY
What about you Are you willing to
die first

MITCH
Yes

Mitch catches the barrel with both hands and clamps it firmly
to upper chest and --

MITCH (CONTD)
Rachel run

Before Levy knows what’s happening Rachel pulls away

Levy tries to turn the gun but Mitch holds on with an iron
grip This gun ain’t pointing at anybody but him

Rachel snatches Ella up from the bed
Levy FIRES

BOOM A bullet shoots through Mitch’s shoulder A vase
behind him - across the room - EXPLODES

Mitch ROARS in pain but hangs onto the barrel Hell die
before he’1l let go

RACHEL
(screams )
Mitch
MITCH

Get out of here
Mitch staggers in pain but still grips the gun

Rachel is almost out of the room as --

BOOM Another shot rips through Mitch’s shoulder -- shatters
a family photo behind him -- and Mitch releases his grip
Almost collapses in pain

Levy turns the gun on Rachel and squeezes the trigger as --

MITCH (CONT’D)
Nooooo

Mitch drives his good shoulder into Levy

BOOM The gun fires wide Takes a chunk out of the door
frame as --

Mitch tackles Levy backwards toward the window and --

EXT UPPER WINDOWN - MITCH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Glass EXPLODES outward

Mitch and Levy fly out into space

They slam down through the branches of a young tree
Are spun apart

Hit more branches

Slam down into --

EXT FRONT GARDEN - MITCH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Levy and Mitch both lie on the lawn Gasping In pain

Levy gets to his feet and bends to pick up the gun He turns
to Mitch and --

BAM Mitch punches him in the face Levy’s head snaps to the
side Mitch hits him again Levy drops the gun Then
swings a fist into Mitch’s bullet-ravaged shoulder

Mitch ROARS in pain Drops to one knee He only has his
right arm His left hangs impotently

Levy stands over him Punches Mitch in the face Grabs
Mitch and drags him to his feet Hits him again And again

Mitch looks done-for Then BAM He punches his right fist
into Levy’s kidney And with all his remaining strength he
drives his forehead into Levy’s nose

BAM The two men stagger apart

Mitch collapses in pain and exhaustion Shoulder pumping
blood He lies there gasping for air as --

Levy claws for the fallen gun Blood streams from his broken
nose He climbs back to his feet and --

Stands over Mitch
Aims the gun down into his face
Mitch laughs through the pain

MITCH
You - are a - fucking - pussy

LEVY
I was afraid God help me Are
you

Levy thumbs the hammer back and --

MITCH
No

A flicker of hurt crosses Levy’s eyes The only thing
keeping him sane was that any man would have done what he
did Mitch has proved him wrong

WHAM Rachel hits him in the back with the ax

Levy staggers in pain Trying to reach the handle He turns
to look at Rachel He raises the gun Is going to shoot her
when --

MITCH (CONT’D)
Noooo

Mitch tries to rise but can’t and --

BOOM A bullet blows the back of Levy’s head out

Mitch looks around for the source of the bullet and sees --
KANON

at the edge of the driveway Gun raised Smoke curls from
the barrel The SCREAM of more patrol cars fill the air
Lights flash

Mitch looks up at the stars above and sighs

DISSOLVE TO

INT EMERGENCY ROOM - HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Mitch is sitting on a bed His left shoulder and chest are
heavily bandaged An IV gives him fluids There are COPS
standing guard at the edge of the curtained area Mitch’s
good arm is cuffed to the metal bed-frame

Kanon walks in past the cops

KANON
How are you feeling
MITCH
Relieved
KANON

Doctor said the bullets didn’t even
clip a bone You’re lucky

Mitch looks past Kanon at Rachel and Ella

MITCH
I know

Kanon follows his look She pulls keys from her pocket and
uncuffs him

MITCH (CONTD)
What are you doing

KANON
I think you’re family’s been
through enough for one night don’t
you

Mitch looks at her She’s serious

MITCH
Thank you

Kanon pockets the cuffs

KANON
Don’t make the mistake of thinking
a few bullets in the shoulder gets
you off the hook counselor
because it doesn’t I’11 expect
you down at the station first thing
tomorrow to give a full statement

MITCH
Understood

Kanon gestures to the Cops to let Rachel and Ella through

MITCH (CONTD)
If only I hadn’t left the accident

KANON
Then you’d be behind bars and Levy
would still be out there Where’s
the justice in that

Kanon is about to walk away when --

MITCH
Any word on Doyle
KANON
He’s in recovery I hear he was

lucky too

Mitch nods Grateful Kanon leaves as Rachel rushes in with
Ella and hugs Mitch

DISSOLVE TO

INT DOYLE’S RECOVERY ROOM - HOSPITAL — DAWN

Doyle’s heart monitor beeps He has IVs coming out of him
and bandages covering his wounds and skull His face is half
swollen

Mitch enters the room arm in a sling and stands at his
bedside

MITCH
Doyle

Doyle’s eyes flicker open He smiles Sleepy but happy to
see Mitch

DOYLE
Hey You bring me flowers

MITCH
I brought you something better

Rachel walks in carrying Ella

MITCH (CONTD)
This is my wife Rachel

RACHEL
Hello Doyle

Doyle blinks and tries to sit up It’s excruciating

RACHEL (CONT’D)
Try not to move

MITCH
And this is your niece

Mitch puts Ella into Doyles arms Doyles eyes well up

DOYLE
Hello Ella

Ella gurgles and smiles
RACHEL
I guess we’ve got some catching up
to do
Rachel sits on the side of the bed

EXT HOSPITAL WINDOW - DAWN

THE CAMERA pulls back Looking in at Rachel Mitch and Doyle
talking Doyle continues to hold Ella They don’t yet look
like a family but it’s a start

THE CAMERA takes in Boston and the rising sun It’s going to
be a beautiful day

FADE OUT

THE END
