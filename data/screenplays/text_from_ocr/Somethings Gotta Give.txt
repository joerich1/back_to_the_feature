OVER BLACK

We hear Ja Rules Livin It Up

EXT NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER

MIDTOWN A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of
cabs her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body

A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT A long line waits to get
in A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and
are promptly let inside
SOHO A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk A
Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs drinking
a beer out of the bottle

HARRY (VO)

Ahhhh The sweet uncomplicated
satisfaction of The Younger Woman That
fleeting age when everything just falls
right into place Its magic time and it
can render any man anywhere --
absolutely helpless Some say Im an
expert on The Younger Woman Guess thats
cause Ive been dating them for over
forty years

INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER

What is it about him Could be his eyes the turn of his
mouthsomething about this guy is just so damn appealing
Maybe its just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his
arm Hes confident cool enviable Were in

A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN
The place is full Everybody is somebody here
HARRY

(to Hostess)
Langer
The Maitred snaps to attention at the sight of him

MAITRED

Mr Langer got your table waiting
As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables we pass Other
Couples Young Couples Middle-aged couples Not talking Couples

HARRY (VO)
So what does a life of bucking the system
all add up to

HARRY (VO) (CONTD)

To never settle down with the right woman
for a life of leftovers and Christmas
mornings No his and her IRA accounts no
mini van parked in the garage I think
its made me what I am today
(Harry smiles to someone
across the room)
The luckiest son of a bitch on earth
Look at me Im positively debonair I
should be illegal Im lookin so good
Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with
his AGE APPROPRIATE WELL-FED WIFE IN SLOW MOTION Harry and
The Beaten Man catch each others glance

HARRY (VO)
It isnt as if I havent wondered what my
life would be like if I was a Regular Joe
and came in here once a month with a dame

my age for a porterhouse and a side of
I spinach Ive wondered

NT CHIC EATERY - HARRYS IMAGINATION

Harry ENTERS all over again This time he looks older
something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket With
him is a regular looking nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN

IN HER FIFTIES

HARRY (VO)

No come on lets be honest a dame
really my age

INT CHIC EATERY - HARRYS IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO

Again the identical set up Harry ENTERS again This time he
looks ten years older The bounce to his step is gone The
twinkle in his eye long dead On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD
BATTLE AX built just like Harry The Maitred reluctantly
shows them to a shitty table

HARRY (VO)

There you have it The story ina
nutshell Not exactly debonair am I
(Harry TRIPS his wife
looks disgusted)
Awww man its down right sad Look at
me I look like Im about to die God
help me I do not want to die

Marin laughs softening as Harry turns down a dirt driveway
driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE

HARRY
Wow Its the perfect beach house

MARIN

I know My mother doesnt know how
to do things that arent perfect

HARRY

Which explains you
That got her Harry parks She looks over at him but hes
grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket then looks up at
her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
such a lovely thought

MARIN

(trying to keep up with
him)
Yeah okay right
They both grab their H
overnight bags and step out of the car

ARRY
So what are we gonna do out here

days
Marin sets her bag down walks to Harry wraps her arms
around his neck

MARIN

Marin smiles then kisses him Hes one of those guys that
lets you kiss them

HARRY

(slaps her tush)
Lets go for a swim how long will
it take you to change

MARIN

Two minutes
Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances
seductively toward the front door then notices Harrys
cigars

MARIN

Oh Har No smoking in the house My
Mom doesnt allow it
HARRY

But she allows you to strip in the
front yard and bring men youre
dating here to

MARIN

She doesnt know everything I doOr
when I do it or where I do it
She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRYS HEAD

INT HOUSE

Its one of those great Beach Houses Light filled and warm
with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around
the rear of the house Marin now in a tight tank tight
pants gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to
undress

MARIN

(TAKING OFF her belt)
The fabulous living room perfect for
entertaining an intimate group of friends
or that special someone

(DROPS her belt then

UNBUTTONS Harrys shirt)
Behind me the requisite Hamptons deck
complete with pool and ocean view
MARIN (CONTD)

(UNBUCKLES Harrys belt)

HARRY

Ladies first
Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of
them Shes now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES

MARIN

Gourmet kitchens to your left

where tonight I will whip you up a

culinary feast of Mac and Cheese
Marin HEARS Harrys ZIPPER UNZIP She turns her EYES
WIDENING as Harrys PANTS land on a chair Harry is now down
to his Boxers an Open Shirt and a fearless smile

MARIN

(smiling)
O-kay going quickly now
Master bedroom is that away
They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM

M

ARIN

magic happens Do we like it Going

HARRY

Harry takes Marins hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO
THE BED She playfully rolls on top of him His hands cup her
ass

MARIN

You know when I first started
auctioneering someone told me if I was
nervous to just picture everyone in the
audience in their underwear This sort of
gives that a whole new meaning
HARRY

Why Youre not nervous now are you
MARIN

Im always a little nervous
HARRY

(removing his hands)
So put on your bathing suit I brought
some champagne Ill put it on ice

MARIN

Me like you Harry Langer
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the
bathroom
Harry lies there alone for a second Catches his breath He
sits up feet on the floor shoulders hunched clears his
throat bangs on his chest He waits a sec then stands with a
stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that
young man

INT LIVING ROOM

Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts Harry crosses through the
Living ROOM singing Livin It Up to himself He reaches into
his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal He sees himself in
the mirror sucks in his gut

INT KITCHEN

Well stocked the best of everything Harry opens the door to the
fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT the BACK DOOR OPENS
and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk in the middle of a lively
conversation

One of them is ERICA Marins Mother The other is Ericas
Younger Sister ZOE

ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old
Its actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better And not
because she looks 35 but because she makes 55 look graceful and
right Erica is the girl most likely who went beyond
expectations but didnt realize until recently that being sure of
herself was a handicap She doesnt try to be intimidating she
just is

Her sister ZOE is in her forties Zoes the loose one She

wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says BOYS LIE

The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR

IS WIDE OPEN Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MENS LEGS poking

E
out from UNDER THE DOOR They don t move
RICA
Oh God What is this
Erica nods to Zoe gesturing a nearby knife Zoe grabs the knife
Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge equally confused
ERICA
(in control)

Okay stay right where you are We have a
knife
HARRY

(eyeing the knife)
Do you live here

ERICA

Okay Mister look Im gonna dial
911 and youre not gonna move Zoe
hand me the phone

(reaches out to Zoe

without looking at her)

HARRY

You dont understand Im a friend

of your daughters
With that Harry SHUTS the fridge door The Women see hes
naked except for a Pair of Boxers They both GASP Zoe
FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly

ERICA

Yeah I dont think so My daughters in

ERICA AND ZOE

ZOE

ERICA
Except hes older than her father I
cant even look at them What is she
doing with a guy that age
ZOE
Marin was how old when you guys broke up
ERICA
Five years ago so twenty-three

ZOE

Okay so she was old enough not to
feel Dave was walking out on her

ERICA

Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out
on me Why do people assume when you

break up after twenty years that the
guys the one who wanted out Just
because once we broke up he shtupped
everything that moved

ZOE
Easy cowgirl I didnt mean it that way

Just trying to figure out why such a
smart girl is always with the wrong guy

Marin crosses to the dessert counter Erica turns back and
catches Harry checking out Marins ass He smiles as he licks
his ice cream Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older
Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior

ERICA
Its an epidemic

Then Erica notices whos next to her at the cheese counter
She sees her Sister Zoe reading a cheese label with her
glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in
their Eighties with their arms linked Almost woozy Erica is
snapped out of it when she is handed her package

Erica heads down the aisle passing Harry whose back is to
her Just as she passes he turns and almost bumps into her

Okay Thats interesting
HARRY

Let me see if I get where youre

ERICA

Im sorry but look you know I hate

and crude for my taste not to mention
just a tad misogynistic

HARRY

Hey a lot of people see rapping as
poetry

ERICA
Yeah but come on how many words
can you rhyme with Bitch
Erica places her groceries on the check out counter

MARIN

(joining Harry)
How we doin

HARRY

INT ERICAS DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster Zoe pours wine and
Erica tosses a salad Harry is the only one sitting

MARIN

So Mom hows the new play You gettin

happy with it
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger
along the nape of his neck They smile at each other as she
continues on Erica notices tries not to respond

ERICA

Well the thing with me is that Im about

90 hard word 10 talent and so far the

talent part hasnt exactly kicked in yet
ZOE

Yeah right

HARRY

Whats your play about
Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica
Shes hesitant to reveal this
ERICA

About Well Im not exactly sure which
is a bit of a problem but so far its
about a divorced woman a writer shes
this high strung over-amped
controlling know it all neurotic
(everyone stares at her)
Whos incredibly cute and lovable
(more stares)
Its a comedy
(takes a seat next to Zoe)

M
So how did you two meet
ARIN

At a Wine Auction at Sothebys Harry was
the big buyer of the night

HARRY

I kept winking at Marin as she was
conducting the auction and apparently
every time I did that she misunderstood
and I ended up buying cases of
outrageously expensive wine

Zoe and Marin laugh

ERICA
Ever been married Harry

HARRY

No No I havent
ERICA
Wow Now why do you think that is

HARRY

Some people just dont fit the mold And
so far

ERICA
Hey if it aint broke
HARRY
Exactly
Harry leans back places his arm around Marins chair Erica
takes note

ZOE

Wait a second arent you like a famous
bachelor

HARRY
I wouldnt say Im famous
ZOE

No I think I read a piece on you
in New York Magazine

HARRY

I guess people find it interesting
that Ive escaped the noose for so
long

ZOE

Yeah wasnt the name of the article
The Escape Artist

ERICA

Wait I read that article That was you
You were once engaged to somebody big
Who was it Not Joan Collins Wait
Carly Simon
ZOE
Yeah it was somebody cool like that

(trying to remember)
Not Martha Stewart

MARIN
You could just ask him
HARRY

No this is more fun Its like Im
not here

MARIN

Harry was once engaged to Diane
Sawyer Okay

ZOE
Right Diane Sawyer I love her
ERICA

(stunned)
Im impressed

HARRY

Yeah women your age love that
about me
Erica pauses on that one

HARRY

(trying to get thru this)
You know what I mean

ERICA
Yes I do
HARRY

Its not a bad thing to say women
your age’

ERICA

NoIm sure it was a compliment
HARRY

It was just the truth
ZOE

(stepping in)
So when was this engagement

HARRY

Long time ago She was just this
adorable lanky girl from Kentucky
with the greatest pair of legs Id
ever seen Never understood her
ending up with a job where she
never showed them

(munches on his lobster)

ERICA
Youre not serious Shes Diane
Sawyer she goes into caves in
Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her
head Who cares about her legs

HARRY

Just anyone whos ever had the
pleasure of You know what I
hate to eat and run but

ZOE

No wait This is actually a very
fascinating dynamic - whats going
on at this table

MARIN

(warning him)

oe teaches Womens Studies at
Columbia

HARRY
Oh so this is gonna hurt
ZOE

No come on listen heres the rub
for women Look at what we have
here with you and Erica Harry
youve been around the block a few
times right Youre what Around
60 never been married which we
all know if you were a woman
would be a curse youd be an old
maid a spinster blah blah
blah Okay so instead of pitying
you they write articles about you
celebrate your never marrying it
makes you illusive and ungettable
Youre a real catch Then take my
gorgeous sister here

ERICA

Any chance of you stopping here
ZOE

Come on this is interesting I
mean look at her shes so
accomplished the most successful
woman playwright since who Lillian
Hellman Shes over fifty
divorced and still sits in night
after night because the available
guys her age want

(to Marin)

ZOE (contd)

--forgive me honey for saying this
but they want girls that look like
Marin so the whole over fifty
dating scene is geared completely
towards men leaving older women out
and as a result that makes the
older women more and more
productive and more and more
interesting which in turn makes
them even less desirable because as
we all know -- men especially
older men are threatened and
deathly afraid of interesting and
accomplished women Its just so
clear Single older women as a
demographic are as fucked a group
as can ever exist

Erica and Harrys EYES CONNECT for a millisecond HEAR THE

SOUND OF PLATES CRASHING

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

OVER we
Erica is cleaning up the broken plates Zoe leans down to
help
ERICA

What are you possessed How could
you say those things

ZOE

It just seemed so obvious to me The
injustice of it Thank God men die
younger than us Its the only break we
get

ERICA

Then you know what Write a dissertation
on it dont announce to the world that I
stay in night after night after night and
by the way one night after night would
have been enough Did you ever realize I
stay in as part of my job Why do you
think I married the director of my plays
He was the only man I ever saw Anyway I
like staying in and I like this time in
my life Why do I have to defend myself
M I was married for 20 years Im done
arin ENTERS carrying more dishes

MARIN

What the hell was that

ZOE

Im sorry I thought I was onto
something
ERICA

Honey what are you doing with this
guy Hes old hes chauvinistic

MARIN
Hes fun
ERICA

Hes fun How is he fun Hes
like wrong

MARIN

Wrong can be fun Mom
ERICA

Not this wrong
MARIN

Can we not do this now Hes
actually incredibly smart and
fascinating and if you had talked
to him about something other than
his marital status you wouldve
found out how smart he is He owns
like 10 different companies

ERICA

What does that mean he owns ten
different companies He cant
commit thats what that means Not
that God forbid I want him to
commit

MARIN

Yeah that I get Anyway he said he
thought you two were very spontaneous and
nice and then said hes leaving as soon
as the sun comes up

ERICA

As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make its way DOWN THE TUBE
and APPROACH HIS ARM Just as the amber liquid is about to
enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm The
drip is knocked onto the ground The Women shriek as the
Nurses scurry to clean up Erica and Zoe rush out Marin

JULIAN

Metoprolol 5mg

HARRY

JULIAN

That doesnt sound so uptight

HARRY

It was an accident She thought I
was asleep I thought her room was
the kitchen

JULIAN

You know what Freud said - there

HARRY

Trust me This was an accident Although
why would she be walking around naked
when she knows Im 20 feet away

JULIAN

Why would you think her bedroom was
the kitchen

HARRY

It was dark it was two in the
morning
JULIAN

That could explain why she was walking

around naked Deep breath

HARRY

You know Ive never seen a woman
that age naked before

EXT BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE IN THE DAY

Erica and Harry walk by the waters edge They are the only

LA which I thought nobody did

ERICA (CONTD)

You were the road manager for a group I

record label at 29 sold it at 45 then
started buying and selling boutique
companies then invested in a small record
company which you turned into the 2nd
largest Hip Hop label in the world

HARRY
Its exhausting just hearing about it
ERICA

I know but the truth is it goes
fast doesnt it

HARRY
Like the blink of an eye
Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE then
another and another

HARRY

I noticed you have bowls of those
all over your house

ERICA

HARRY

But why do you only pick up the white
ones

Erica is stunned that he caught on to that Harry bends down
picks up a BROWN stone places it in her palm among the white
stones

HARRY

Erica rises LOOKS IN THE MIRROR checks out her boobs in her

She looks

HARRY
We are cute
ERICA

This is pretty unusual for me Im not
used to having sleepovers

HARRY
Me either
ERICA
Really With your social life

HARRY

My dear you are confusing sex with sleeping

Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone
ERICA

Okay good to know
(heading for the kitchen)
So what are you hungry for

HARRY

(joining her)
What are my choices I mean I know you
think Im not very discriminating but
through the fridge

ERICA

Oh God whats the difference what I
think I cant imagine what you think of
me Okay so Pasta left over coq au
vin turkey sandwich or grilled cheese
HARRY
Pancakes
ERICA

Totally what I wanted Blueberries

HARRY

You ever miss being married I bet you
were great at it

ERICA
Sometimes I miss it At night But not
that much anymore Was one of us just
saying something interesting

HARRY

You said you cant imagine what I think
of you

ERICA

Oh right but you dont have to answer
that

HARRY
Okay
ERICA

I mean if you had an opinion Id be

curious but
HARRY

will you tell me first why you only
miss being married at night

ERICA

(cracking eggs)

Oh cause the phone doesnt ring as much
at night and the alone thing happens at
night and sleeping by myself took some
getting used to But I got the hang of
it You gotta sleep in the middle of the
bed Its absolutely not healthy to have
a side when no one has the other side

She starts mixing the batter

HARRY
Okay now Im convinced what I
think of you is right
(Erica waits )
You are a tower of strength

ERICA

(shoulders sagging)
Ughhhhhhhhhh

HARRY
Try not to rate my answer
ERICA

Im sorry Its justIm sorry

HARRY

Youre like a thoroughbred in a world of
mutts No you know what you are youre
like a great portrait over a fireplace
Words have been invented to describe
women like you

ERICA
( fearful)
Such as
HARRY

Flinty andImpervious
ERICA

So you think Im inhuman
HARRY

No I think youre formidable
ERICA

But cold and distant Like Im
frozen in some painting

HARRY

Not at all I think youre strength
defines you

(sees how sensitive she

is)
But its thrilling when your defenses are
down arid youre not isolated That I
believe is your winning combo A killer
combo actually

ERICA
So I cant decide if you hate me or if
maybe youre the only person who ever got
me

HARRY

I dont hate you

is suddenly lit up and one of Ericas French CDs comes on
full blast

Harry opens his eyes Hes surprised to see he has his arm
around her Erica awakens just as surprised In the light of
day a definite hint of embarrassment

HARRY

(grabs his watch blinks)
Can you see this

ERICA

Not really but it looks like it

HARRY

(slips on his glasses)
It is eleven

ERICA

HARRY

Erica
(she turns)

You are a woman to love
Erica smiles then walks away with the achey walk of a woman
who hasnt had sex in many a year but has more than made up
for it in the last 12 hours She holds onto the wall as she
exits the room a little bow-legged like shes just gotten
off a horse Alone in the hallway she stops

ERICA

You are woman to love What the
hell does that mean

themselves right Ill go back to

a glass of wine She looks vibrant She glances up from her
drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around
the tables She leans to the side for a better look to make
sure its him It is him and hes corning right toward her

Her stomach sinks her mind races and before she can come
up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is

HARRY

HARRY

I was actually okay but I was sure I was

HARRY (VO
I was there about six hours when it
occurred to me that wasting away on an
island in the Caribbean wasnt going to
remotely cure what was ailing me
Harry sits straight up into CAMERA
BLACK SCREEN
A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRYS CLOSET
HARRY (VO)
So I decided to take another kind of
pilgrimageinto my past
Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET reaches onto a top shelf and starts
pulling down dozens of what used be called Little Black Books
HARRY (VO)
My thought was -- if I retraced my steps
and visited all the women Ive dated

He blows dust off of the books

BACK IN PARIS

HARRY

-- maybe I could figure out how I
got so screwed up

FLASHBACK - HARRYS PILGRIMAGE
Harry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT EACH ONE

SLAMMING IN HIS FACE
HARRY (VO)

A lot of the women wouldnt see me
Then we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE

HARRY (VO)

Or speak to me
Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama

HARRY (VO)

But I was on a mission to save my
soul

A Woman In Her Fifties purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN
MAIN STREET carrying groceries

Harry at her side keeps talking at her even though she
picks up her pace and ignores him

HARRY (VO)

My losing streak finally ended when

I got one to open up to me
In a HOSPITAL ROOM an Older Woman on life support scrawls
out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by
herside A Priest stands in the background The note says

As I remember it you were wildly insensitive Harry lowers
his head in shame She places another note in front of him
It says I forgive you Relieved he smiles Then one last
note Now scram

HARRY (VO)
Hearing what they had to say was no

picnic
In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP Harry pas coffee
with a Woman in her Mid Forties She talks his ear off
Harry can t deal with it He looks away The woman
places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to
her and keeps talking at him

H

ARRY (V O)

But I stuck it out and I listened

Then I listened harder
Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her
Thirties who carries a cello She never shuts up

HARRY (V O )

And one of the things I realized
was I was actually giving closure
to generations of women

At the corner the Woman hugs Harry goodbye

HARRY (V O )

Although I admit some refused to
give no matter what I did

CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER

On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA She glances out the
STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks
holding signs He HOLDS A SIGN that says DIANE YOU WERE
RIGHT I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG IM SORRY She looks him
straight in the eye and gives him the finger

HARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT

When you hear the same story about
yourself over and over your life
begins to make sense and the future
becomes your only salvation

INT PARIS BISTRO - THE PRESENT

Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance Julian
takes Ericas hand and leads her to the dance floor Harry
watches them slip through the crowd Erica turns back Harry
waves Julian takes Erica in his arms its clear shes
comfortable in his embrace None of this is lost on Harry
and as he watches the smile on his face more than fades it
evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt

EXT STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

Harry with his collar turned up against the cold walks past
the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre

EXT PONT NEUF - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Harry walks over the bridge the beauty surrounding him just
making it all worse He stops looks out at the Seine He
hears a classic French song in the distance then sees a
small barge playing the music pass beneath him Without
warning a tear falls from his eye

HARRY

(laughs at himself)
At the end of the day Im nothin

standing on a bridge in Paris

running snow falling on her hair and coat

HARRY

Because I realized what I was feeling for

language I didnt speak

(she listens)
It scared me so I did what I do I snuck
away Turns out the heart attack was easy
to get over You were somethin else

(shes starting to melt)
And when I went to see all those women I
found out I was never really present for
any of them And something inside me at
some point had justshut off Thats

saved me I finally get what its all
