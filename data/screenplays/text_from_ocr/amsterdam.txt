could possibly help him But if I
contact them they’1ll know where I
am and if they know where I am
they will find a way to possibly
drag me back And they are very
persuasive

the regiment I hear those guys
have it rough back at home

VALERIE VOZE

headed anyway

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER

attention Someone like Mister
Voze who knew Bill Meekins

BEATRICE
Burtram

BURT BERENDSEN
Beatrice

BEATRICE
My family are longstanding members
of the state medical board and I
can attest to the fact that both of
these men are horrible liars to
each other let alone to the
police If you take them in before
giving them the chance to give you
everything they’ve offered I’m
afraid it could cost you your job
My father has a lot of friends at
City Hall

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
Get us everything you promised

BURT BERENDSEN
We understand You and me We got
something in common We served
unlike this guy

DETECTIVE HILTZ

BURT BERENDSEN DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER

shatter

EXT BEATRICE’S BUILDING - STREET - NIGHT

Burt and Harold make their way down the steps of Beatrice’s
apartment onto the street Suddenly a car pulls up with
Taron Milfax and his confederate Eli Bepp sitting next to
him

Milfax sticks his gun out the window points it at Burt and
Harold and draws a number five in the air

TARON MILFAX
Committee of the Five stay alive
Keep your mouth shut

BURT BERENDSEN (VO)
Why not just drive up and shoot us

In Burt’s mind A replay of the exact scene plays out with
Taron Milfax and Eli Bepp shooting at Burt and Harold

BACK TO REAL TIME SCENE PULLS AWAY

TARON MILFAX

(as he drives off)
Committee of the Five always

alive We’re everywhere

BURT BERENDSEN (VO)

HAROLD WOODMAN
How is this coincidence possible
VALERIE VOZE
Because it’s not a coincidence I
told Liz Meekins to hire you two

HAROLD WOODMAN
What do you mean you told Liz
Meekins to hire us

VALERIE VOZE
She’s a friend of mine She needed
someone she could trust Someone
outside our social circle

BURT BERENDSEN
Ahh - this is so strange

VALERIE VOZE
I never told you my real last name
Bandenberg was a traveling name
But that was our deal in Amsterdam
Nothing about the past right

HAROLD WOODMAN
You lived in New Jersey this whole
time

VALERIE VOZE
Yeah

HAROLD WOODMAN
This is a big house This is how
you live

VALERIE VOZE
Yeah

HAROLD WOODMAN
No letter Not a phone call

VALERIE VOZE

I once was It’s not who you met in
Amsterdam

She sways a bit

HAROLD WOODMAN
What’s wrong with your balance

VALERIE VOZE
I have a nerve disorder

HAROLD WOODMAN
You never had that before

BURT BERENDSEN
No she never had that before

Harold and Burt look at each other then Valerie

BURT BERENDSEN (CONTD)
We are here for a reason Harold
Let’s not forget it’s pretty
urgent Valerie do you know Tom
Voze

VALERIE VOZE
Of course I know Tom

HAROLD WOODMAN
We’re in a lot of trouble Valerie
We need him to vouch for us

VALERE
He’s a good guy but I don’t think
he’1ll vouch for you He avoids
controversy he doesn’t like that
He’s easily intimidated

HAROLD WOODMAN
Is he your husband

VALERIE VOZE
No he’s not my husband he’s
married to the woman out there
screaming to have you kicked out
He’s my brother

HAROLD WOODMAN
After everything we had in
Amsterdam turns out Burt and I
have no idea who you were

VALERIE VOZE
You know exactly who I am and I
know exactly who you are All three
of us Burt too We know each other
the way it counts And if you two
still have an arrangement then I’m
still a part of it

HAROLD WOODMAN
Maybe not after twelve years

VALERIE VOZE
Yes after twelve years Yes
because I ended up here And I came
back - because of you - and you

BURT BERENDSEN
That’s true

VALERIE VOZE
I told you when you left Amsterdam
something bad would happen I said
it would be the bad part of the
dream did I not say that

BURT BERENDSEN
That’s true

Libby knocks on their door interrupting their conversation

VALERIE VOZE
And here we are

LIBBY VOZE (0C)
Valerie Carlton is on his way
Open the door

VALERIE VOZE

They hear keys jingling at the door

Carlton walks right into Harold’s left hook which drops him
right to the ground alongside Burt

LIBBY VOZE

Harold Valerie and Libby all lean over Burt’s body looking

while gentle

TOM VOZE
There he is The brandy Mrs
Moran

Mrs Moran hands Tom a glass of brandy Tom puts the brandy
under Burt’s nose

BURT BERENDSEN
No thank you I don’t drink

TOM VOZE
I don’t think I trust a man who
doesn’t like a drink especially at
a time like this

BURT BERENDSEN
Maybe I like it too much

Burt holds his fingers up to his missing eye

BURT BERENDSEN (CONTD)
Where is my eye Harold

HAROLD WOODMAN
Right here

Harold hands Burt his glass eye

TOM VOZE
I never expected two decorated
soldiers to get knocked out at my
own home

HAROLD WOODMAN
Just one sir

TOM VOZE
Oh that’s right Mr Woodman You
were too fast for Carlton

Carlton sits with a frowning expression on his face He holds
an icepack up to the cheek that Harold punched him in

HAROLD WOODMAN
I was

LIBBY VOZE
They started talking to Valerie and
she’s not well and please darling
girl stop crying

TOM VOZE
It’s only natural for her to cry
Libby She just found out her
friend is dead We couldn’t keep it
from her for forever

VALERIE VOZE
I’m not so ill that I can’t talk to
people

LIBBY VOZE
You leave me here with this invalid
when you know very well that she
should be hospitalized--

TOM VOZE
Libby

LIBBY VOZE
It’s for her own good

VALERIE VOZE
Don’t you ever say that to me again
or Ill put you in a hospital I’1l
send you to a witch trial

TOM VOZE
Please ladies Stop

Tom takes a moment to collect himself and regain composure
TOM VOZE (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m sorry I had to raise
my voice

LIBBY VOZE
She was talking to these men like
she knows them That terrified me

TOM VOZE
Do you know one another

VALERIE VOZE LIBBY VOZE
Yes No

BURT BERENDSEN
Yes

HAROLD WOODMAN
We do indeed Europe

BURT BERENDSEN
Amsterdam

VALERIE VOZE
The hospital

LIBBY VOZE
They said that they were from the
Episcopal charities

TOM VOZE
Is there any truth to that at all

BURT BERENDSEN HAROLD WOODMAN
Absolutely In part

LIBBY VOZE
In part

BURT BERENDSEN

The gala’s coming up Mostly a
veteran event but there might be
Episcopalians there And Bill
Meekins was our featured speaker
but we find ourselves in this
terrible situation where we’re
accused of killing Liz Meekins
which is not true in any way

HAROLD WOODMAN
Liz mentioned the name Voze and so
we thought you might know who was
after her and could help clear our
names

BURT BERENDSEN
We’re veterans We’re respectable
We wouldn’t be involved in any of
this except to help

TOM VOZE
Bill Meekins was a graham cracker
of a man Not a mean bone in his
body

VALERIE VOZE
Why did I have to help her Why did
I have to encourage her and go
around everyone we know to hire
these two

TOM VOZE
I did help her darling I told her
to come to me for help before it
got bad Now look what happened

LIBBY VOZE
Yes look what you did Valerie I’m
sorry it’s unfortunate but you
shouldn’t have gotten involved

TOM VOZE
It’s not her fault It’s not her
fault

LIBBY VOZE

Tom How is this not her fault
Some things are her fault

Valerie starts crying

VALERIE VOZE
Tom Tom

LIBBY VOZE
(mimicking Valerie)
Oh Tom Please

Tom comforts his sister by kissing her on the head
Burt raises his hand

BURT BERENDSEN
If we can find out who killed Bill
Meekins it’s probably the same
people who killed his daughter for
looking into it And that
information would clear our names
(MORE)
BURT BERENDSEN (CONTD)
The autopsy indicated he was
possibly poisoned by too many
medicines while he was in Europe
Do you know who he was traveling
with or who sent him

TOM VOZE
I can help you find out but I
can’t get personally involved-

VALERIE VOZE
You’re a coward Tom

LIBBY VOZE
Don’t you dare call him a coward
You know that’s what he was called
by those prep school kids it’s
cruel Valerie and you know it

TOM VOZE

They want me to get involved in all
these committees and clubs You
know what I do instead I’ma
birdwatcher That’s what I do

HAROLD WOODMAN
That must be good gets you
outside

VALERIE VOZE
He’s a birdwatcher He’s
ridiculous

LIBBY VOZE
He’s no more ridiculous than you
are with your movies razor blades
teacups the horrid things you make
Valerie honestly they’re
demented

Tom laughs

BURT BERENDSEN
Excuse me You said that you could
help us find who traveled with him
to Europe Who would know

TOM VOZE
Gil Dillenbeck would know Do you
know him

BURT BERENDSEN
The whole country knows him

HAROLD WOODMAN
He’s the most decorated marine in
US history

TOM VOZE

Dillenbeck was friends with
Meekins They were both generals I
never got involved with the
military I just ran the family’s
textile company Dillenbeck can
tell you who was traveling with
Meekins I wouldn’t trust anyone
else and I don’t have access to
that kind of information myself

HAROLD WOODMAN
We met him twice Took a picture
with him once in Belgium and
another at the Bonus Army March in
Summer ‘32 We still have those
pictures Mr Voze

TOM VOZE
He’s very particular about who
he’1ll speak to If you’ve met him
and you’re soldiers he respects
your chances are far better than
mine He distrusts people of means

LIBBY VOZE
If you meet him please do let us
know I would love to shake his
hand

VALERIE VOZE
Libby saw Dillenbeck in the
newsreel and she has a crush on
him

LIBBY VOZE
Oh don’t be ridiculous Valerie

VALERIE VOZE
You have talked about that newsreel
a lot

LIBBY VOZE
He’s a very impressive man and I
happen to like that newsreel--

VALERIE VOZE
Don’t play it Tom

LIBBY VOZE
We should play it before they go
Valerie Gil Dillenbeck is the one
hope your friends have of getting
out of all this trouble

Tom turns to Harold and Burt and opens his hands in wryness

TOM VOZE
Would you like to see the newsreel

Burt nods and frowns why not

LIBBY VOZE
Oh good

All exit while HAROLD AND VALERIE linger behind to speak
intimately in alcove of the screening room

HAROLD WOODMAN
You said youd come back

VALERIE VOZE
Why So you could leave me

adventure or if you even thought
about me at all Valerie

really What about you

HAROLD WOODMAN
No Not really

VALERIE VOZE
Really
HAROLD WOODMAN
Yes And what did you mean

TOM VOZE
I see a rose breasted grosbeak a
dark-eyed junco it reminds me of
God’s green Earth

BURT BERENDSEN
Yeah I don’t know those birds

TOM VOZE
There’s this man from England who
has violated every sacred rule of
birding by going into twenty-four
nests of a nearly extinct species--
to take twenty-four eggs -- all for
one man’s selfish glorification to
get his name in a bird book for
some meaningless discovery And
THAT is the type of person who I
think very likely did something
awful to Bill Meekins and his
daughter

BURT BERENDSEN
I’m trying to follow you here sir
are you saying That man the bird
thing England the nest and the
book -- that he killed Bill
Meekins
TOM VOZE
I’m trying to make a point That
type of man

BURT BERENDSEN
OK I’m still not certain what you
mean

TOM VOZE
Dr Berendsen you seem like a good
person with your medicines and your
veterans You shouldn’t be
hindered you should be helped But
I’m only one person

BURT BERENDSEN
Sir we didn’t do anything And we
need the police to know that

There was nothing “hush-hush” about
it Liz Meekins authorized it

BURT BERENDSEN (CONTD)

that

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER

HILTZ STOPS BURT IN THE DOORWAY TO THE NEXT OFFICE WHERE IRMA
WAITS

BURT BERENDSEN

Irma St Clair

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
Yes thank you

BURT ENTERS THE NEXT OFFICE CLOSING THE DOOR ON THE
DETECTIVES

INT BURT’S PRIVATE FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Irma St Clair stands wearing a white swing coat over her
shoulders

IRMA ST CLAIR
I understand we’ve both had an
unusual time since last we saw each
other

BURT BERENDSEN
What happened Why is your coat
over your shoulder

IRMA ST CLAIR
That’s what I wanted to tell you
I was filing the autopsy results
when this red faced man with an
angry face and this other one --

BURT BERENDSEN
What happened

Irma reveals a bandaged wrist under her coat

IRMA ST CLAIR
They threw me down Burt they
broke my wrist and they took the
autopsy results They took
everything But it wasn’t--

BURT BERENDSEN
That’s not well done

IRMA ST CLAIR
I know

BURT BERENDSEN
That is angulated That needs to be
reset or else that is going to be
very bad Can I

IRMA ST CLAIR
OK

BURT BERENDSEN
Let me take your coat

Burt leads Irma to a desk where she can sit down Irma clasps
Burt’s shoulder to brace herself Burt speaks over her
shoulder as she holds him

BURT BERENDSEN (CONTD)
Remember that one time you were
telling me you liked a Spanish
melody or was it classical

IRMA ST CLAIR
Classical--

Irma cries and shouts into Burt’s shoulder as Burt resets her
broken wrist she blinks tears

BURT BERENDSEN
That’s it That’s it We’re done
It’s OK It’s OK You alright

IRMA ST CLAIR
Yes

BURT BERENDSEN
I’m going to get a sling Just keep
that supported I’m so sorry that
you got mixed up in all this

IRMA ST CLAIR
I’m an autopsy nurse I get mixed
up in all sorts of things Besides
it brought me closer to you and to-

Burt leans in and they share a tender kiss for a moment

IRMA ST CLAIR (CONTD)
They’re waiting for us

BURT BERENDSEN
Let them wait

Burt turns on the radio turns the dial until a French song
plays CUT TO

Other side of the door Detectives Getweiler and Hiltz
listen

DETECTIVE HILTZ
Why is he playing music

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
He likes music I don’t know why
he’s playing it now

DETECTIVE HILTZ
Do you like this music

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
Me I mean I don’t know

Burt and Irma silently digest this moment each taking a turn
to walk to the window and look out while the other waits at
the desk - not a word is spoken as the music plays and now
Burt sits next to Irma on the edge of the desk when the
reverie is broken --

As suddenly the door swings open and Beatrice storms in

BURT BERENDSEN
Beatrice

Beatrice slaps Burt hard across the face

BURT BERENDSEN (CONTD)
What are you doing here

BEATRICE
Who is this woman

BURT BERENDSEN
This is Irma We work together

BEATRICE
Mhm

BURT BERENDSEN
She’s an autopsy nurse

Beatrice abruptly turns the radio off The camera pans to the
Detectives staring

BEATRICE
Don’t give me that Come home I’11
defy my family so we can be
together

BURT BERENDSEN
Is this real Why are you here now
Of all times You never come here

BEATRICE
Because Shirley is on my side and
she calls me and tells me when to
protect my husband My father
controls your medical license you
know that

BURT BERENDSEN
Can you get your parents to put
their names on the committee for
the gala for the veterans so we can
get respect and dignity And you
can tell your parents that Tom Voze
might be involved

BEATRICE
Yes but how will you get him You
won’t get him

BURT BERENDSEN
I already met him

BEATRICE
Well I introduced you

BURT BERENDSEN
You didn’t introduce us You told
us about him and then me and
Harold we met him

BEATRICE
I’m really sorry Burt I think you
should think about who you are and
what you want to be

Beatrice leans in for a kiss it is awkward Burt does not
want to kiss her - she has not kissed him the entire movie -
why now Beatrice turns and leaves staring down Irma

BURT BERENDSEN
Shirley not helpful

Burt leads Irma and the detectives out of the room and back
into the reception office

BURT BERENDSEN (CONTD)
We need a sling

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
Where are the autopsy results

BURT BERENDSEN
She was rolled Lem Quite possibly
by the same man who pushed Liz
Meekins

SECRETARY SHIRLEY (0S)
I got the sling

Burt helps fix the sling around Irma’s wrist and shoulder

IRMA ST CLAIR
I can give you a description--

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
You mean they were stolen

IRMA ST CLAIR
Yes They were stolen

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
What about the results

IRMA ST CLAIR
I can tell you the results I
remember them I found mercury
luminal and somnifene in his
stomach And they were in high
amounts I believe they were given
to him the last week of his life

BURT BERENDSEN
Last week Which means probably on
the boat

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
So we don’t have anything to give
our captain Right

BURT BERENDSEN
She just gave you the evidence

IRMA ST CLAIR

them all the time I’m bonded by
the city and certified

BURT BERENDSEN

DETECTIVE HILTZ

this guy in jail

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
Let me handle this let me handle
it

Detective Hiltz turns to Valerie’s shrapnel tea set

DETECTIVE HILTZ
What’s this degenerate tea set

BURT BERENDSEN DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
That is art That’s art Youve got to get rid of
this It’s obscene No
that’s not art Art is
beautiful lovely it evokes
thoughts

BURT BERENDSEN (CONTD)
That’s what that is

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
That’s what that is

BURT BERENDSEN

Yes

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
Why would you take a tea set -- a
lovely tea set -- and turn it into

an instrument of violence It makes
no sense

BURT BERENDSEN
That’s a great question Perhaps
Lem the question of the century
Don’t think about it too much Lem
where is the camaraderie We were
in the Argonne let’s live allons
vivre New pill Remember this You
owe me

He gives Lem the pill case

DETECTIVE LEM GETWEILER
Okay but you owe me too Get me

love maybe is even possible And
this pill is working

MILTON KING
Did I mention that I predicted
extreme trouble from a white man in
a box Then added to by a WHITE
WOMAN under a truck

BURT BERENDSEN
Good point Milton

MILTON KING
You know I’d rather be on trial
for killing five white men than one
white woman because this can lead
to one black man or more dead ina
box

BURT BERENDSEN
Please let’s get going We should
have left for Dillenbeck’s hours
ago That’s the only hope that we
have to get out of this situation
with the police

HENRY NORCROSS
A federal employee they don’t need
to talk about or I trust they
wouldn’t be here

BURT BERENDSEN
What does all of this have to do
with a “glass business” in England
and financing in Washington

HENRY NORCROSS
They overlap lots of things
overlap Berendsen the whole world
overlaps in its most treacherous
ways if you pay attention and hello
Burt Harold and Valerie

VALERIE VOZE
Hello Henry

HAROLD WOODMAN
You’re looking good Henry

HENRY NORCROSS
It’s good to see you too as we
gather once more on the right side
of history Paul I understand you
had a drink thrown in your face in
the tea court just now

PAUL CANTERBURY
Yes It’s just old business from
England Henry

HENRY NORCROSS
No no no a drink in your face is
a drink in my face

(MORE)
HENRY NORCROSS (CONTD)
Id like to hear about it please
then we’1ll get onto new business

PAUL CANTERBURY
It was someone from the
Ornithological Society of Great
Britain

HENRY NORCROSS
Ah one of those rotten bastards
What

BURT BERENDSEN
I was told a story about a misdeed
in the bird society of England and
I’m starting to wonder if that
story is about you

PAUL CANTERBURY
Our discovery was hardly trivial

HENRY NORCROSS
Yes We proved the cuckoo lacks the
capacity the civility the
character to build its own nest

BURT BERENDSEN
Wow How is that possibly
significant or interesting to
anybody or anything

PAUL CANTERBURY
Because it shows the cuckoo’s a
parasitic bird it tricks better
birds to build nests The cuckoo
destroys the host’s own eggs and
then destroys the nest itself

HENRY NORCROSS
Berendsen the cuckoo doesn’t give
a damn I’d say it’s a profound
statement about the parasitic
destructive behavior of nature
including humans

VALERIE VOZE
That’s especially true after what
we saw today

HAROLD WOODMAN
Burt it’s the story about what
happened to us Listen up

VALERIE VOZE
We have been trying to tell you
and I think Paul and Henry should
hear this too We ended up ina
very strange clinic today and we
found this

Valerie holds up a small glass vial of medical powder On the
vial are a symbol on paper of two crossed backward fives

VALERIE VOZE (CONTD)
Those symbols were everywhere

Henry takes the vial from Valerie Him and Paul begin to
inspect it focusing on the symbols

HAROLD WOODMAN
Have you seen it before The
Committee of the Five

Harold draws a five in the air with his finger

HAROLD WOODMAN (CONTD)
I went to see Valerie as we’d
arranged But then we noticed
somebody was watching us

FLASH BACK TO
INT VOZE MANSION - VALERIE’S ART ROOM - DAY

Harold and Valerie suddenly stop to look out the window They
point at someone outside

HAROLD WOODMAN
That’s the man who pushed Liz
Meekins

VALERIE VOZE (VO)
And he must have got bored waiting
because he decided to leave and we
decided to follow him and he led
us to Rockland County

HAROLD WOODMAN (VO)
To an unmarked brick building

INT CORRIDOR CLINIC - DAY

The backs of Harold and Valerie walk in slowly to see a
reception room and surgery rooms separated by lots of glass

They see PATIENTS in gowns with partially shaved heads and
scars Harold and Valerie enter one of the rooms

Valerie sees a glass vial with SYMBOLS on a table and nicks
one without anyone noticing

Harold and Valerie are surprised when a woman patient
violently hits the window of another room trying to leave

HAROLD WOODMAN (VO)
They assumed that we were patients
for a procedure

VALERIE VOZE (VO)
To be sterilized

BURT BERENDSEN (VO)
It was a forced sterilization
clinic

Harold looks to his right down a narrow corridor and there
Taron Milfax the red-faced man who pushed Liz Meekins

Milfax walks down the corridor toward Harold and Valerie

HAROLD WOODMAN (VO)
Then I saw the man This red-faced
man The man who pushed Liz
Meekins And he looked right at me
and he said

TARON MILFAX
This is your moment to end your
inferiority You’re going to have
that procedure here

Milfax withdraws his PISTOL Harold knocks it away and
punches him THEY STRUGGLE OVER THE GUN as

ELI BEPP MILFAX’S ACCOMPLICE CLOSES UPON VALERIE FROM THE
SIDE

VALERIE PULLS OUT A SMALL POCKET PISTOL POINTS IT AT BEPP

VALERIE VOZE
Don’t move

She fires her pistol once in Bepp’s face - CLICK it doesn’t
work

VALERIE VOZE (CONTD)
Shit

Shakes the pistol pointing up - it fires BLAM hits a BEAKER
OF GRAY MEDICAL POWDER that clouds the room

is

Harold beats red-faced Milfax to the ground and flattens the

Bepp

VALERIE VOZE (CONTD)
Come on

Valerie and Harold run out as camera pushes in to symbol on
glass window ‘THE GREAT NATION SOCIETY PRIVATE FOUNDATION’
with a kind of SWASTIKA

BACK TO

HAROLD WOODMAN (VO)
Valerie’s gun finally went off it
hit the glass and we got out of
there headed back to the city

BURT BERENDSEN
My God Well I’m glad you’re
alright But if you didn’t get the
Red-Faced Killer’s identification
Then it’s of no help whatsoever

HAROLD WOODMAN
What are you talking about Burt It
has everything to do with
everything Today what happened--

BURT BERENDSEN
How

HAROLD WOODMAN
It starts with me it starts with
me A long time ago I told some
friends in Longview Texas not to
visit a horrifying clinic a lot
like the one we saw today A mob of
white men chased me they harassed
me they tried to kill me They
were unsuccessful they were very
unsuccessful I left Longview
Texas and I never looked back

HENRY NORCROSS
It’s not just about you in Texas or
today in Rockland There is an
organization that wishes to do this
all over the world

BURT BERENDSEN
What does it mean

PAUL CANTERBURY
It means there’s a cabal in this
country tied to another in Germany
who supports these clinics who
want to rule the world

BURT BERENDSEN
Rule the world

HENRY NORCROSS
Exactly correct

HE SITS BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIS HEAD FOR
EMPHASIS

VALERIE VOZE
Who’s in the cabal

HENRY NORCROSS
Maybe ‘who’ is the wrong question
instead ask ‘why’

PAUL CANTERBURY
Go see Dillenbeck Ask him ‘why’
his fellow General Meekins was
murdered

HENRY NORCROSS
Dillenbeck he’s been leading on
this cabal to find out who they
are what they plan Committee of
the Five

PAUL CANTERBURY
The organization named them
Committee of the Five We’re trying
to figure out who they are

HAROLD WOODMAN PAUL CANTERBURY (CONTD)
Committee of the Five (in German)
Komitee der funf

HENRY NORCROSS
I think it would be wonderful if
Dillenbeck was the speaker at your
reunion

PAUL CANTERBURY
It seems your event’s become rather
important Berendsen If you can
get Dillenbeck to speak perhaps it
might attract more influential
people of the cabal

HENRY NORCROSS
The killer from the street or the
higher ups paying for it all

BURT BERENDSEN
Wait wait wait wait wait no I
don’t want our event Harold’s and
my event to be used like this by
anybody

HENRY NORCROSS
Used No Think of it as protecting
what you love

PAUL CANTERBURY
We told you in Amsterdam we’d come
a-calling and here we are

BURT BERENDSEN
And here you are Well are we done
or do you want to talk more about
birds

HENRY NORCROSS
You know a lot of people assume
that it’s about the tranquility or
the communion with nature But I
find birdwatching so fascinating
because it forces you to decide
what you are looking at I am
honing my art of discernment And I
want you to trust me that I believe
now is the time to intervene We
get Gil Dillenbeck to speak at this
event he will be the magnet that
draws all the nails out of the wood
and brings this house of treachery
down to the ground So what do you
say Burt please

PAUL CANTERBURY
Please try Burt

INT LOBBY OF THE WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

BURT BERENDSEN
Yeah you feel fine then all of a
sudden vertigo and you get dizzy

VALERIE VOZE
It comes and goes At first they
told me that I had epilepsy I
never had a seizure but they told
me that the seizures would come
sooner or later but that could be
avoided if I took medication And
so I did And then I started having
other symptoms more symptoms And
they said that’s hereditary that’s
from your Mother’s side So they
gave me new medications and I kept
taking that And now years and
years have gone by and I’m barely
leaving the house and I feel like

ADVENTURE IN OFF-WHITE SHIRT WITH A LIGHT COLORED TIE TUCKED
INTO THE SHIRT AND SUSPENDERS AS HE FEEDS TREATS TO A SMALL
DOG HE HOLDS

GIL DILLENBECK
She’s pulling everybody’s leg half
the time that’s why I love her

BURT BERENDSEN
What an honor sir Was it the
pictures that made you change your
mind about seeing us

CUT TO INT DILLENBECK’S STUDY - DILLENBECK’S HOUSE

Dillenbeck sits holding up the picture of HAROLD AND BURT
WITH DILLENBECK

GIL DILLENBECK
How can I know this is you really
in the pictures

BURT BERENDSEN
Yes sir so I’m the doctor She’s
the nurse he’s the attorney We
all met in Belgium which if you
recall is where we met for the
first time

HAROLD WOODMAN
As well as Washington last summer
for the VEF March

GIL DILLENBECK
I’1l tell you one thing that I can
remember quite clearly you did
something -- you sang a song I
believe

HAROLD WOODMAN
Which one sir

GIL DILLENBECK
Well that’s for you to remember I
met thousands of people you just
met me twice and so you should
remember the song I’d like you to
sing it for me now and then I’1l1
know it’s you

VALERIE VOZE
Sing a song

BURT AND HAROLD LOOK AT EACH OTHER TO REMEMBER A SONG
HAROLD BURT VALERIE (SING)
Did you ever see a dream walking
Well I did Did you ever a see a
dream talking Well I did --

GIL DILLENBECK
Oh no no no that’s not it

Burt and Harold look at each other

VALERIE VOZE
Was it in French

GIL DILLENBECK
I’1l know it when I hear it

VALERIE VOZE
(begins to sing)
“Le soleil rouge du pamplemousse”

The three of them sing THE NONSENSE SONG

BURT HAROLD VALERIE
(three part harmony)
“Le mouchoir quand tu appelles le
visage a déchiffrer de qui mon
nom a moi --”

GIL DILLENBECK
Yes that was it

BURT BERENDSEN
That’s right

VALERIE VOZE
We made it up it’s not supposed to
make sense because it’s a nonsense
song

HAROLD WOODMAN
But it makes us feel good

GIL DILLENBECK
And you’re the doctor

BURT BERENDSEN
That’s right sir

GIL DILLENBECK
And you evacuated four thousand men
in one day you’re very famous

BURT BERENDSEN
Different doctor That’s the social
guy from San Francisco Story of my
life

GIL DILLENBECK
Not you

HAROLD WOODMAN
Burt and I did evacuate a couple of
thousand men in one day though
sir

GIL DILLENBECK
(to Harold)
And you sir you stabbed thirty
Germans with your knife and they
called you “Black Death”

HAROLD WOODMAN
No sir that was “Black Death”
Henry Johnson but I did get twelve
of them before they gave me this

Harold points to the scar on his jaw line

VALERIE VOZE
I also saved a lot of lives

GIL DILLENBECK
You did

VALERIE VOZE
Yeah

GIL DILLENBECK
Well that’s something to be proud
of It’s shameful they made you
wear those French uniforms you
should wear your own country’s
uniform

HAROLD WOODMAN
From your mouth to God’s ear sir
Thank you

BURT BERENDSEN
So General Bill Meekins

GIL DILLENBECK
Bill Meekins was a friend of mine
it’s a tragedy what happened to him
and his daughter and it’s a
disgrace that no one cares

VALERIE VOZE
Well we care

HAROLD WOODMAN
Indeed The late Elizabeth Meekins
hired us actually

GIL DILLENBECK
She hired you Why

HAROLD WOODMAN
She didn’t believe that her father
died of natural causes

VALERIE VOZE
On his way back from Europe

GIL DILLENBECK
The last time I spoke to my friend
he called me from Rome He called
me from the hotel and he told me
something monstrous that he had
seen It disturbed him greatly
That was why Bill was killed Did
you see the man downstairs when you
came in

(MORE)

GIL DILLENBECK (CONTD)
Every couple of weeks he comes and
he brings -- did you see a bag A
bag of money he offers to me

BURT BERENDSEN
Money for what

GIL DILLENBECK
To give a speech He won’t tell me
who is behind him I ask him And
I’‘ll say “who is this from” But
he doesn’t give me an answer

VALERIE VOZE
They’re paying you to be their
mouthpiece

GIL DILLENBECK
That’s right exactly

VALERIE VOZE
And they know that the veterans
will follow

HAROLD WOODMAN
The Committee of the Five

GIL DILLENBECK
Somebody is trying to do something
dark and treacherous Come here

VALERIE VOZE
(whispering to Burt)
Ask him if he’ll speak at the Gala

HAROLD WOODMAN
(whispering to Burt)
Push further like Henry said

BURT BERENDSEN
Sir if these guys are meeting you
and you want to find out who’s
behind it all Why not go further
and lead them to our reunion Gala
event They might show themselves
in some fashion

Dillenbeck opens the door to his room and looks downstairs
THEY SEE MAGUIRE SITTING WITH HIS BAG

INT STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

GIL DILLENBECK
(over the staircase)
Maguire can you tell me why do come
every month

MAGUIRE
Well General I can’t speak about
it in front of other people

GIL DILLENBECK
Well why not You say that there’s
nothing to hide and it’s in the
name of a good cause

MAGUIRE
Yes sir but not everybody
understands it

GIL DILLENBECK
What I don’t understand is who or
what you represent Can you tell
me

Dillenbeck walks down the stairs by himself while Harold
Burt and Valerie watch from the top of the staircase

MAGUIRE
Oh I’m not at liberty to say who I
represent sir But they are very
important people and they have a
very important organization that is
going to change everything for the
better The purpose as I’ve told
you sir is to lead this nation
properly in this time of economic
crisis There’s a cripple in the
White House Roosevelt is weak
Wed like you to speak on behalf of
the veterans and new leadership

GIL DILLENBECK
Well that’s what elections are for
Maguire Don’t you believe in the
constitution

MAGUIRE
Of course but we feel that action
is urgently needed now

GIL DILLENBECK
From a retired General before the
election

(MORE)

GIL DILLENBECK (CONTD)
Do you want me to be a dictator Is
that what your big sponsors want

MAGUIRE
A dictator No it doesn’t have to
be said like that

GIL DILLENBECK
OK a “chancellor” Does that make
it better It still violates the
Constitution

MAGUIRE
They did this with veterans in
Germany and Italy very successful

Maguire holds up the leather bag in his arms

MAGUIRE (CONTD)
Eighteen-thousand sir from the
Committee of the Five -- Committee
for a Sound Dollar

GIL DILLENBECK
From who

BURT BERENDSEN
Committee of the Five

MAGUIRE
Committee for a Sound Dollar
The nation needs your leadership
Do you see where I’m going sir

GIL DILLENBECK
Mr Maguire I’ve changed my mind
I decided I will do the speech

MAGUIRE
This is very exciting

GIL DILLENBECK
I’1l choose the event I’m most
comfortable speaking with the
veterans Bill Meekins knew from the
regiment he created I’ll speak at
their reunion

MAGUIRE
Of course but--

GIL DILLENBECK
Because I want to see the men who
put the money in that bag

(MORE )

GIL DILLENBECK (CONTD)
And I want to look them in the eye
and I want to shake their hand

MAGUIRE
Given that we’re partners now I
can guarantee that you’ll meet the
distinguished gentlemen on the
Committee for a Sound Dollar
They’ll be there to meet you
personally although we might need
to be in a private room

GIL DILLENBECK
OK

MAGUIRE
Thank you This is wonderful

Maguire tries to hand Dillenbeck a speech

MAGUIRE (CONTD)
This is the speech

GIL DILLENBECK
Mr Maguire take that bag

MAGUIRE
Yes sir

GIL DILLENBECK
So you still won’t tell me who they
are Is that true

Maguire tips his hat as he answers Dillenbeck’s question

MAGUIRE
At the event sir

MAGUIRE LEAVES BRIMMING WITH HAPPINESS DILLENBECK LOOKS AT
BURT HAROLD VALERIE

GIL DILLENBECK
Whoever offers me more money and
tells me what to say and what not
to say in my speech very likely
killed Bill Meekins and his
daughter and is behind all of this

BURT BERENDSEN (VO)
And so two soldiers and a nurse
found themselves in league with the
great honorable decorated General
Dillenbeck

BURT BERENDSEN
General you should really speak to
Tom Voze Valerie’s brother

Michigan or Carbondale Illinois
sitting at home listening to the
radio hearing your songs Burt And
your speech General

GIL DILLENBECK
The speech Maguire gave me

TOM VOZE
No no YOUR speech The speech
that you want to give I don’t know
who Maguire is but I want you to
speak from your heart to vindicate
Bill Meekins and all of those
voiceless veterans who have been
abandoned

BURT BERENDSEN
YES

TOM VOZE
You lead the way and the rotten
apples whatever they did to Bill
Meekins will reveal themselves

GIL DILLENBECK
Ill give the speech my way I want
to tell the truth

BURT BERENDSEN (VO)
The trick was to let the Committee
of Five and Maguire think that the
General would give THEIR speech for
new leadership in the White House
immediately no election conning
the veterans into supporting it
And Tom as promised had gotten us
off the hook with the police--

DOOR OPENS DETECTIVES GETWEILER AND HILTZ WALK IN HOLDING

INT WINGS OF STAGE - CONTINUOUS
LIBBY HOLDS UP A BOTTLE OF GERMAN PERVITIN EYE DROPS

BURT BERENDSEN
What is that

TOM VOZE
This is one of the finest
innovations from Zurich It removes
all pain all anxiety

Tom tilts his head back as Libby drips Pervitin in each eye

TOM VOZE (CONTD)
All needless thoughts that occupy
the mind

Burt leans forward eager to try it as well Tom takes the
bottle and gives droplets to Burt’s eyes

BURT BERENDSEN
My back is killing me normally
guys like me we have to turn to
booze or to morphine and that can
lead to addiction and -- Oh that’s
fast That’s advanced Oh that is
tremendous energy I feel no pain

TOM VOZE
It’s good isn’t it

BURT BERENDSEN
This is good

TOM VOZE
There’s more where this came from
Burt
Libby leans her head back Tom brings the dropper to her

eyes

BURT BERENDSEN
I want to know more about this I
would love to have the chemical
compound

LIBBY VOZE
When I get together with my sisters
at the Vril Society we hold a
seance where we let our hair down
and it acts as a kind of antenna
It allows us to communicate with
the greater race Honestly they
come from a different galaxy it’s
truly fascinating

is saying

I wanted to say for your speech
tonight General some friendly
advice

BURT BERENDSEN
Oh please please please don’t
give him any friendly advice

GIL DILLENBECK
Oh yeah Well what’s the friendly
advice

TOM VOZE
Tonight people will be listening
to you on the radio You’1l never
have a bigger audience with more
excited attention from everyone
(MORE )

TOM VOZE (CONTD)
Theyll be looking to you for
inspiration Remember the veterans
who have bled and died on our
behalf and remember Bill Meekins
and honor him respectfully

LIBBY VOZE
If you improvise and get lost in
the woods on some complicated
criminal situation over Meekins’
death it will reflect badly on
you And we don’t want that for you
General

BURT BERENDSEN
The General was very clear that he
was going to honor Bill Meekins
and tell the truth

TOM VOZE
That’s exactly what I mean Focus
on the good qualities that Meekins
had -- his quietness and his
kindness

GIL DILLENBECK
That’s what I intend to do in my
own way

Tom beckons to an associate WHO PASSES A THICK VALISE TO TOM

BURT BERENDSEN
What is that

TOM VOZE
Feel this This is walrus

Burt feels the valise

BURT BERENDSEN
Oh that is soft

General Dillenbeck quickly touches the valise with a few of
his fingers then he takes his hand away

GIL DILLENBECK
A walrus was killed for this

TOM VOZE
No sir he died of old age He
lived a long and happy life because
he made smart choices It’s a
contribution to your foundation

GIL DILLENBECK
I don’t have a foundation

TOM VOZE
Well maybe you should start one I
can help you 36000 General
Think of everything you can do with
Dr Berendsen and your medical
innovations

LIBBY VOZE
So much could be accomplished You
have to take the money

GIL DILLENBECK
What do you mean I have to take it

TOM VOZE
Listen to me Someone not me they
will take your face and your name
put it in the New York Times and
wipe their dog’s ass with it Think
of everything you’ve accomplished
in your life It will be forgotten
erased Youll be treated like an
old kook and buried by history
That’s what they can do Make the
right speech Or they’1ll turn you
into a martyr and say an anarchist

did it

LIBBY VOZE
Don’t make the mistake like Bill
Meekins

TOM VOZE

That was a tragic theft of a life

Burt and the General stare at Tom and Libby as the closing
notes of “Lady of Spain” ring out

INT GALA STAGE
Burt takes the microphone at the podium

BURT BERENDSEN
My name is Burt Berendsen Most of
you know me I am the son of a
mechanic from Elmira As a child
we love the world naturally And we
hope that the world loves us As my
friend Harold says sometimes I
might have followed the wrong God
home But not this man He always
followed the right God home

APPLAUSE AND SHOUTS AS THE GENERAL STEPS TO THE MICROPHONE

CROWD OF VETS

shallow bleeders rotters
INT GALA STAGE - CONTINUOUS
GIL DILLENBECK
If the few people shouting at me in
German had any courage you would

behave with dignity

Crowd applauds as the Bund stand still and cold

GIL DILLENBECK (CONTD)
I’ve fought in five wars on three
continents People shot at me my
whole life my whole life I know
fear and I know facing fear but
the one thing I truly detest the
one thing I truly truly detest is
cruelty I’ve been offered money to
become the self appointed leader of
the veterans -- veterans like you
To be put in the White House
without an election as some sort
of advisor by popular demand of
you These same people want me to
emulate a certain European leader
named Mussolini They think he’s
the type of leader that this
country needs The type of leader
who ran over a child and never
stopped his car The type of leader
whose excuse was “What’s one person
in the affairs of the state”
General Bill Meekins was in that
car He was a friend of mine He
was a good person But when he told
that story and when he intended to
tell it again here on this stage
he became another person whose life
was worth nothing in the affairs of
the state He was murdered

The crowd reacts in shock

GIL DILLENBECK (CONTD)
Yes he was murdered and
dishonored as I might be murdered
or dishonored for telling that
story here tonight What kind of
country does this become when that
happens I became a
Marine to serve the constitution
which intends for us all to be
equal in the brotherhood of
mankind But what good is it when
powerful people make exceptions for
the people who stand in their way
Some people of influence and power
like it when regular folks are
fired up by hatred because it
distracts us from fairness and
kindness They don’t want us to
think about too much just so they
can get more and more of what they
already have which is vast wealth

(MORE )

GIL DILLENBECK (CONTD)
This is your country This is YOUR
country Don’t let the big men take
it away from you

TOM VOZE

VALERIE VOZE
We just fought that man for our
lives

HAROLD WOODMAN
Burt and I saw him push Liz
Meekins He’s the killer

HENRY NORCROSS
There is enough evidence I’m sorry
to say that the man who took a
shot at General Dillenbeck on that
stage tonight was the same man on
the boat as Bill Meekins ona
ticket purchased by your
foundation
LIBBY VOZE
There is no need to raise your
voice

HENRY NORCROSS
Yours Mr Voze

LIBBY VOZE
What are the charges

PAUL CANTERBURY
The charges are against you and the
guests you invited

HENRY NORCROSS

TOM VOZE
For what

VALERIE VOZE
The Committee of the Five

HENRY NORCROSS

Conspiracy to bribe a United States
General attempted assassination
conspiracy to overthrow the US
Government trading with dictators
Italy Germany a few murders your
foundation seems to be responsible
for Meekins and his daughter

VALERIE VOZE
Tom did you do this

TOM VOZE
I felt it was wrong that Meekins
died That was a tragic theft of a
life But something had to be done
because he didn’t see the
opportunity of the new ways to
live

LIBBY VOZE
He didn’t understand Meekins
didn’t understand Do you
understand that

HENRY NORCROSS
You need to slow it down

VALERIE VOZE
Tom please tell me you didn’t have
anything to do with my medication

PAUL CANTERBURY

Valerie as he had done with your
mother before

VALERIE VOZE
Is that true

TOM VOZE
A little

VALERIE VOZE
A little

TOM VOZE
I did it for your own good

VALERIE VOZE
You poisoned me

TOM VOZE
If that’s what you want to call it
fine I was looking after you your
best interests You’re reckless
like a child Listen to me you’re
running around all over Europe
youre saying bad things about the
war consorting with a black man

MILTON KING
Consorting with a free man in
Amsterdam that fought for you

HAROLD WOODMAN

symbol there

VALERIE VOZE

BURT BERENDSEN (VO)
That Tom had an angle was no
surprise but the horror of it my
God right under Valerie’s nose
They kept her distracted with the
invented condition Goering
Hitler’s right-hand man and Hitler
himself Most people didn’t even
know who he was yet Tom even paid
Goering to write in the Jeffers
papers about the new Aryan
government whatever that was Tom
had just finished the topiary with
the symbol -- you couldn’t see it
except from above I mean you’ve
gotta be some kind of super fanatic
believer to make your bushes like
that

VALERIE VOZE
Don’t you look at me like that
Libby

LIBBY VOZE
Valerie darling all great
societies are built this way You
live in a dream world with your
strange sculptures and that’s fine
you can have that But it won’t
make the world go around

VALERIE VOZE
I’m very happy to be unimportant
and live in a place that has love
and beauty Art and love that’s
what makes the life worth living
while you’re building this big
gigantic terrifying future What a
waste of your imagination

TOM VOZE
I made plenty for us rebuilding
Germany

them

might lead to an attempt to set up
a fascist dictatorship

The plan outlined to me was to form

an organization of veterans to use

as a bluff or as a club at least

to intimidate the government and

break down our democratic

institutions
