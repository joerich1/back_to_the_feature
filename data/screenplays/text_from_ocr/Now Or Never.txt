Dr Shemp glances at a clock on the wall behind her

DR SHEMP
Im afraid our time is up

by JUDY her paranoid middle-aged boss

INT DR SHEMPS OFFICE -- DAY

Alice is in another session Dr Shemp observes His
expression is impenetrable

ALICE
Its not fair I miss him and I
dont even get to be mad at him
because hes not here

DR SHEMP
Perhaps we should explore where
this anger is coming from

ALICE
I think its a natural reaction
DR SHEMP
Were not talking about whats
natural were talking about you

ALICE
I thought I was getting married and
now Im not This hurts me
Because Im hurt I want to lash
out

DR SHEMP
Perhaps youre really angry with
your father

Alice elects to ignore this interpretation

ALICE
I realized last night that the
world is primarily unfair I know
it sounds obvious look at the
Holocaust for Gods sake Its not
a logical thought more the sudden
realization that Ive lived my life
believing that things come around
that good things happen to good
people that life affords us
compensation equal to our
suffering But its all delusional
bullshit isnt it Do you believe
in past lives

DR SHEMP
What do you mean In the sense of
a Jungian collective consciousness

ALICE
No in the I was the third wife of
Henry the Eighth sense

DR SHEMP
Im more from the object relations
school -- Winnicott Fairbairn

good breast bad breast --

ALICE
Theres a good breast and a bad
breast

DR SHEMP

According to Melanie Klein yes

INT ALICES APARTMENT -- DAY

Sunday morning Alice stands before a blank canvas waiting
for inspiration

She dips her brush into a blob of yellow ochre but is wracked
with indecision and cannot apply it

She puts down her brush and soaks a wad of newspaper with
paint thinner

The solvent highlights a classified ad for Varya the past
life medium The ad is identical to the one she saw in the
Yellow Pages

EXT HOUSE OF VARYA -- DAY

Referring to an address written on a scrap of paper Alice

Varya takes the last bite of her sandwich and wipes her hands
on a napkin

VARYA
So Tell me why you are here

ALICE
Someone at work was talking about
you I saw your ad I usually
dont go for this sort of thing

VARYA
But you are in a time of stress

ALICE
Yes

VARYA
And you were curious

ALICE
I am curious

VARYA
Our eyes illuminate only a dim path
before us and our memory distorts
what we leave behind A dark
curtain obscures everything else I
imagine that there are people in
the world who never wonder what is
behind the curtain I find this
very strange

Varya takes their plates to the sink and rinses them under
the tap

VARYA
(continuing)
Have you ever had the feeling you
have lived other lives

ALICE
Ive always hoped there was
something more than this

Varya fills a silver bowl with about an inch of water

VARYA
You were raised a Christian

ALICE
Catholic yes

VARYA
But you no longer practice

Varya returns to her seat and places the silver bowl between
them

ALICE
I havent been in a church since I
was ten

Alice watches as Varya wets her index finger in the bowl She
holds it above the surface of the water

VARYA
Leaving an emptiness you try to
fill with your art Innocent
blood the beauty of martyrdom --

ALICE
-- peace on earth and sexless
unions

Alice watches a drop of water fall from Varyas finger into
the bowl The waves ripple and return in slow motion

VARYA
Do you feel comfortable leaving
here now

ALICE
Yes

VARYA
Shall we go back

Alice is transfixed by the water

ALICE
We shall

VARYA
If you find yourself somewhere you
dont like simply say the word
help and we will go to another
place Do you understand

Alice nods She watches as another drop falls from Varyas
finger

Alice hears the sound of HOWLING WIND The water in the bowl
darkens eddies and closes in filling her entire frame of
vision

Alice retreats into her trance

VARYA
(continuing)
Tell me where we are

She hears the JINGLE of a bell over the door and looks
towards it

Four men swagger in Their hair is lifted and slicked back
they wear black jumpsuits with the collars turned up and
their pant legs are tucked into their boots Wrap-around
sunglasses shield their eyes They are known as the MEMPHIS
MAFIA

Two more MEN follow closely behind

The first has a fat jowly face and a cigar crammed into the
corner of his mouth This is COLONEL TOM PARKER He uses a
cane purely as affectation

The second is a modest Young Man in a tweed sport coat and
black tie Doriss jaw drops as she recognizes him

DORIS
Is it -- are you -- him

ELVIS

Elvis sits with the others Doris approaches and takes out

falls to the floor near Elviss feet

off three hamburger patties and slaps them on the grill
where bacon sizzles near a neatly cornered pile of hash

board and removes a covered pan Turning back to the stove

oil

ANNE
Which order is his

Junior flips four slices of white bread into a four slice
toaster Moving down the line he stirs up a bowl of hush
puppy batter and dollops silver dollar sized portions into
the heated skillet

DORIS
(continuing)
Do you think hed take offense if I
asked for his autograph

JUMBO

generous man

Anne shakes a layer of cornmeal directly onto the cutting
board and smooths it evenly with the palm of her hand

ANNE
What do you know about Elvis

She reaches into the pan and fishes out two catfish fillets
which have been marinating in mustard cream and various
spices She holds the fillets above the pan allowing the
marinade to run off

JUMBO
I pick up a newspaper now and
again
(to Doris)
Get one for me too would ya

ANNE
He aint gonna be in such a
generous mood if you burn those
hush puppies

JUMBO shakes the pan and starts turning them with a fork

Anne rolls the catfish fillets in the cornmeal and lowers
them carefully into the skillet

DORIS
I dont know I hadnt given it any
thought

DR SHEMP
Its natural to go through a state
of denial Youve lost your
fiancee On the list of major
stressors it ranks closely with
the death of a loved one

ALICE
Which is sandwiched right between
moving and losing your pet

DR SHEMP
There are healthier ways to deal
with stress You could go for a
walk or try diaphragmatic
breathing

Alice looks at him

insane person I1l1 call and

cancel as soon as I get home

sauteing in butter

underside She extinguishes the heat from beneath the onions
and uncovers two pie tins with the crust already pressed into
the bottom of the pan She arranges the onions neatly inside
the pie crust

Turning back to the stove she pours two inches of cooking
oil into another pan and lights a high flame beneath it

She slides the top crust to the onion pie from between two
floured sheets of waxed paper She places it carefully on
top and crimps it around the edges

With a sharp boning knife she scores a rose pattern into the
crust She opens the oven and slides the pie inside

She turns her attention to a cutting board where a heaping
pile of cut and cleaned okra awaits She covers the okra
with salt and pepper She snaps open a clean paper bag and
pours in a cup and a half of corn meal

She slides the okra into the bag shakes it quickly and pours
it into the pan with the hot oil

From the refrigerator comes a bucket of washed and cleaned
collard greens Anne scoops them out with both hands and
dumps them in the pot of boiling water

She selects an apple from a basket on the counter rinses it
under the sink and starts peeling it with a paring knife

Maggie enters She goes to the sink to wash her hands She
looks to Anne and notices that she has begun to have trouble
with the apple

The knife slips and she nearly cuts herself Trying again
she is put off when a tremor beginning at her shoulder
extends down the length of her left arm forcing her to put
down her work

MAGGIE

Elvis is working on a platter of grits eggs and sausage He
picks up a piece of toast mops up some yolk and stuffs it
in his mouth

He lifts up his shirt and exposes his belly He pokes at it
with his finger

affixed to it with Kevins name is stuffed to the gills with
mail It looks like no one has touched it for days

Remembering she has the key she unlocks the door and steps
inside

Looking for a place to set the mail Alice cant resist a
look around Stealing through the apartment like a thief

she finds that the place is a mess

Dishes are scattered about The floor is littered with
clothes An acoustic guitar is supine on the sofa

Moving into the kitchen she finds an empty spot on the
counter and sets down Kevins mail

Out of habit she opens the fridge and has a look It is
full to the hinges Everything is industrial sized -- tubs
of butter a loaf of Wonder Bread bananas She takes out a
giant jar of olives pops a few in her mouth and closes the
fridge

She tiptoes her way to the bedroom and finds the door ajar
Peering through the gap she sees the imprint of a body in
the unmade bed Her memory flashes on Brian sleeping nude

She turns from the door and leaves the apartment

Alice arranges an eggplant a turnip some apples and some

a blanket up around Kevin and exits quietly

life

She hands the painting to Kevin

over his privates

table

KEVIN

(continuing)

people are born with old souls
That they mustve gone through the
circle of life and death many times
before because they seem to have
wisdom beyond their years

ALICE
Do you think thats you

KEVIN
I think so

whole body begins to shake

Now it came to pass as they were
on their journey that he entered a
certain village and a woman named
Martha welcomed him into her house

ELVIS (continuing)

And she had a sister called Mary
who also seated herself at the
Lords feet and listened to his
word But Martha was busy about
much serving And she came up and
said Lord is it no concern of
thine that my sister has left me to
serve alone Tell her therefore to
help me But the Lord answered
and said to her Martha Martha
thou art anxious and troubled about
many things and yet only one thing
is needful Mary has chosen the
best part and it will not be taken
away from her

Elvis closes the book and turns to his disciples

ELVIS

ALICE
No I dont think so

as long to get over a relationship
as you were in it I was with
Brian for four years so I guess
Ill be over him in two

KEVIN
What if you came across the right
guy before that

ALICE
Id probably walk right past him

KEVIN
I think the misery of sensitive
people is caused by the fact that
they are delivered into rigid
environments formed by people of
bad intent over which they have no
control

Alice pretends to give this some thought
ALICE
Sometimes I think I could get my
nose pierced
She drinks from her beer
ALICE

(continuing)

canister of flour It takes a lot of effort for her to carry
it to the counter Setting it down she pauses to catch her
breath and wipe the sweat from her brow

She goes to the fridge and takes out a glass bowl full of
eggs Returning she begins to get woozy her steps are
unsteady She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath

Elvis holds up his hand requesting silence He squares
himself SHOUTS and strikes the table with all his might

If anything broke it was in his hand

The girls grimace Elvis stands stock still Red
approaches

RED
(continuing)
You all right

In a fit of temper Elvis throws over the table and stomps on
it repeatedly with the heel of his motorcycle boot

No one knows what to do Elvis keeps kicking the table again
and again

Realizing its futile he begins to calm down He looks at
the table He looks at everyone in the room

ELVIS
That is one solid piece of
furniture

Elvis smiles The others breathe sighs of relief

ELVIS
(continuing)
I think Im going to need another
drink

Red turns up the radio Joe picks up a bottle of wine and
refills the girls glasses

Elvis goes to the bar which is set up on a piece of glass on
top of a dresser His back is to the room

He slides open a drawer Inside is a turquoise-handled Colt
-45 pistol He drops the clip to check and see that its
loaded It is

He takes the gun from the drawer and raises it up One of
the girls notices and SCREAMS

Elvis takes aim at the chandelier BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM
BAM BAM BAM One by one he shoots out the glass shaded
lamps The marksmanship is not bad for someone whos
probably had enough Demerol to stun an ox

behind it He drops four slices of Wonder Bread into the
toaster and pushes down the lever Moving on to the stove

The most common mistake in the
preparation of the fried peanut
butter and banana sandwich is to
not toast the bread If you fall
into this trap you end up with a
mushy sandwich thats cold in the
middle

melted butter The toast pops up Elvis puts it on a paper
plate and shows it to Anne

He opens the peanut butter and finds a knife He scoops some
out and slathers it on the bread

ELVIS

either

A thick coat is applied to all four slices

You shouldnt be able to tell where
the peanut butter ends and the
bananas begin

it onto the bread

ALICE
She said I was nuts and that she
wouldnt see me anymore

Dr Shemp passes her a box of tissues Alice takes one and
dries her eyes

ALICE
How could I have made all that up

DR SHEMP
Your subconscious was trying to
heal the wound created by the loss
of your fiancee Since you were
not ready to face it in reality it
was cushioning the blow With most
people this process would have
manifested itself in simple denial
but since you are a creative
person your subconscious devised a
creative solution

Alice is now crying full force Dr Shemps heart goes out
He gets up from his chair and sits beside her He puts his
arm around her and cradles her head against his shoulder
Alice stiffens

He guides her face towards him and leans in to kiss her

Alice recoils in horror

ceiling in pleats which converge at the center The effect
is dizzying

monkey

done in moderation
