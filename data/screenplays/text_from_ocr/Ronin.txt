RONIN
an original screenplay by

JD Zeik

DRAFT May 20 1997

A BLOOD RED SCREEN - A JAPANESE DRUM starts to play softly
but tinged with a desperate edge growing louder joined by
other DRUMS as a BLACK LEGEND scrolls up In feudal Japan
the warrior class of Samurai were sworn to protect their
liege lords with their lives Those Samurai whose liege was
killed suffered a great shame and they were forced to wander
the land looking for work as hired swords or bandits These
masterless warriors were no longer referred to as Samurai
they were known by another name Such men were called Ronin
The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT and then
the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT Thwpfft

FADE IN ON
INT A MEDIEVAL CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Its dark and so it takes us a minute to realize were
MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS up up up in what we now see
is a medieval cathedral And as we continue MOVING UP
something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD Running thin
then thicker as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find -
A BODY sprawled awkwardly across the stones arms and legs
akimbo not so much Christ-like as victim-like In one hand
the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use In the
other - A DARK SHAPE we cant quite tell what it is
FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame
silenced pistol dangling at his side We dont know him and
its going to be a while before we see him again but mark
his face because well see him again The Killer now picks
up the dark shape in the Bodys hand and we see its - A
BRIEFCASE The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and
turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him subordinates The
Killer shows them the Briefcase
KILLER
God loves me

THE BODY suddenly twitches -- this guy is not quite dead
The Killer raises his silenced pistol

KILLER
(to his victim)
But I dont think hes too fond of you

SLAM CUT TO
EXT A BACK STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

A PHONE RINGS replacing the sound of the silenced gun shot
we expected to hear

Rain-slicked cobblestones gleam in a twinkling of
streetlight

EXT A PHONE BOOTH AT THE END OF THE STREET

The source of the ringing We start to PUSH SLOWLY IN one the
phone booth and as we do we hear the VOICE of an UGLY
AMERICAN

UGLY AMERICAN (VO)
What is this

CUT TO
INT A DRIVE BAR IN PARIS - NIGHT

A SOCCER MATCH is in progress on a TV which sits above the
bar in this smokey dim dive

UGLY AMERICAN (0S)
This is not football

And now were PULLING BACK DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE BAR We
see THREE MEN sitting seperately at the bar paying no
attention to each other One of these men watches the game
with real interest The Ugly American talks on from off
screen

UGLY AMERICAN (0S)
(continuing)
Football is three hundred pound guys
they run way too fucking fast they got
helmets made of kevlar they use to spear
the quarterback into the next life
SLAM CUT TO
EXT THE STREET OUTSIDE

The phone is still ringing louder now and were MOVING
TOWARDS it while looking THROUGH AN UNSEEN PAIR OF EYES and
even as we drink this in were back in -

INT THE BAR

AT THE END OF THE BAR - LARRY the Ugly American Hes got
an obvious attitude all of it bad But theres something
about the guy -- hes not all bluster and he has the look of
a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble
Hes big and yeah hes got a gut but the rest of him looks
solid

LARRY

(talking to the air)
You wanna know what football is Its
hitting the other guy dirty and then
spitting in his face when hes down
Football is all things American and
American is A-Number-One the absolute
fucking best there is Thats what
football is

(he points to the TV)
And thats not football

The one man at the bar whos been watching the gam turns
slowly and gives Larry a long look This is VINCENT French
hard boiled and solid Charming when he wants to be which
isnt all that often He gives Larry a long look and then
speaks -

VINCENT
(to Larry in perfect English)
Football -- American football -- is a

game for faggots

A BEAT The other two men at the bar who seem like tough
customers themselves pretend not to watch too closely but
theyre interested whats Larry going to say For a moment
it seems as if hes pissed but then suddenly a smile breaks
out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincents remark
Vincent joins in as do the others In particular - THE
BARTENDER looks relieved -- hes tough enough to toss a bar
drunk but these guys are in a different league The
Bartender laughs with the others happy to have avoided a
confrontation as we go back to -
EXT THE STREET OUTSIDE

Were almost ON TOP OF the phone booth the phone is still
ringing as a HAND reaches INTO FRAME and snatches the phone
from its cradle

A WOMANS VOICE (V0O)
(a touch Irish accent)
Yes

ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see a woman named DEIRDRE on the
phone striking dark-haired Irish She carries herself
with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar
Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end
and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE
stands in the shadows of the bar watching Deirdre She
gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking her
hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat

DEIRDRE
Can I help you

The silhouette steps into a POOL OF LIGHT This is SAM
Tough lean enigmatic Somebody you might trust but whom
youd never cross Sam returns her look before he speaks

SAM
No

Sam moves towards the bar and Deirdre returns to her phone
conversation

DEIRDRE
Im here
(a beat responding to a
question)
No it was nothing

INT THE BAR - A MINUTE LATER

Sam enters and by now the men inside have all come together
at the bar talking casually recognizing theyre somehow all
here for a reason With Larry and Vincent we see - GREGOR a
man from Eastern Europe His accent is hard to pin down

but he most definitely has one Gregor has the air of an ex-
spook and thats exactly what he is Lastly we see SWEDE --
blonde muscular and somehow blank in the face No hes

not stupid -- hes a sociopath Now - Sam looks at the
group which grows quiet as he enters Finally Sam speaks
SAM

Sorry Im late
VINCENT
(a challenge)
What makes you think were here to meet
you

SAM
(meeting Vincents gaze)
Who else would you be

Vincent turns towards the others including them in an
expansive gesture

VINCENT
Perhaps the police

SAM
I know cops -- and youre no cop

Vincent smiles at Sams answer satisfied and makes room for
Sam to join them Vincent takes a pack of cigarettes shakes
them so that one sticks out and offers it to Sam

VINCENT
Cigarette

SAM
No thanks

Vincent looks a little disappointed at this as we go -
EXT BACK OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

THE PAY PHONE makes a sharp noise as its cracked back into
the cradle Deirdre stands at the phone booth lost in
thought Then without warning - Deirdre spins around
pulling TWO GUNS from inside her coat The move is fast
performed with the grace of a professional killer as Deridre
scans the horizon but nobody seems to be watching Deirdre
pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street
the better to watch -

THE BAR - And as Deirdre watches the bar we watch her
PULLING BACK from Deirdre UP INTO THE AIR and then MOVING
THROUGH TO -

INT A CHEAP APARTMENT - SAME TIME

LOOKING THROUGH A WINDOW donw onto the street below Barely
visible we can see Deirdre And staring at Deirdre - THE
WATCHER Somebody were going to see periodically through
the movie Right now hes only a SILHOUETTE with a well-
defined PAIR OF HANDS And in those hands - A KNIFE As the
Watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife
methodically perfectly And he watches First Deirdre and
then turning his attention to THE BAR Hes especially
interested in the bar

A TIME CUT TO
INT THE BAR - LATER

The BARTENDER is wiping out a last glass When this is
finished he looks up at -

A TABLE IN THE BACK -

Where our five guys have relocated Now the Bartender and
Vincent exchange a look and then the Bartender takes out a
set of keys and tosses them - THROUGH THE AIR and they SMWACK
into Vincents hand The Bartender and Vincent speak in
rapid-fire French and then the Bartender is gone Sam turns
to Vincent

SAM
He trusts you to lock up

VINCENT
Lets just say he knows who I am

Vincent takes out his pack of cigarettes and offer them
around the table -- again nobody takes on Vincent seems
really disappointed by this

LARRY
Anybody wanna tell me what were waiting
for

VINCENT

(lighting his cigarette)
The question isnt what were waiting
for its who

LARRY
And who the fuck is that

GREGOR
Whoever hired us

SAM
I got this gig through a contractor
And he most definitely didnt know who
was doing the hiring only that they
were paying a lot of money
Theres a kind of general look around the table -- a nod or
grunt of acknowledgement indicating that all of these men
were hired the same way

SAM
(continuing his thought)
So none of us knows whos paying the
freight this is just some anonymous job
For all we know were working for
different people

GREGOR
Now that is an interesting proposition

SWEDE
How so

GREGOR
Because if theres more than one party
involved if we really are working for
different people then perhaps some of us
are on different sides
(with great meaning)
Your orders might be different from mine

LARRY
Whatre you talking about man I dont
understand
SWEDE
(quietly but loud enough to be
heard)

What a surprise

LARRY
I got a surprise for you blondie

GREGOR
(sharply as if hes used to
giving orders)
Why dont both of you shut up

LARRY and SWEDE
(to Gregor at the same time)
Fuck you

SAM
Knock it off

There is a BEAT Gregor Swede and Larry look at Sam who
glares them all down Lastly Sam turns and looks at
Vincent

The two men nod at one another acknowledging a

kind of mutual respect

From OFF SCREEN we hear a new sound LAUGHTER

Deirdre has entered the bar

exchange

SAM

The point remains we could be working
for different people Theres a chance
for one of us

(looks around the table)
Maybe more than one of us -- has been
paid to cross the others I dont know
about you guys but I like to know who
Im working for It can help prevent a
great deal of

(finding the right word)
unpleasantness

LARRY
(patting the gun inside his
cheap suit)
Anybody tries to unpleasant me Ill put
two between his eyes -- one to do the job
and the other to make sure it takes

DEIRDRE
Its good to see youve all got such
faith in our little undertaking

LARRY
Who the fuck are you

DEIRDRE
(staring at Larry)
The name is Deirdre and Im running this
show

GREGOR
Who are you IRA

DEIRDRE
(with a brittle laugh)
Not likely Once yeah I was -- but

there wasnt an inch of profit in it and
Im a cash oriented girl if you take my
meaning Im a hired gun same as the
rest of you and thats all any of us
needs to know about the other

ANOTHER ANGLE

and shes amused by this last
Deirdre hands out several thick envelopes

Larry and Swede

open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed
inside Even Gregor cracks his envelope and peaks at his

money But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a

DEIRDRE

look

From here on in you want something you

pay cash for it no credit cards

no bank

accounts are in place ten percent up
front the rest when the job is done

(a quick beat then she looks
at Gregor)

You What do you do and what should we

call you

GREGOR

These days they they call me Gregor -- and

Im a tech I do electronic work
surveillance computer runs

Deirdre turns to Sam

SAM
Sam Im a weapons guy

DEIRDRE
You were a soldier were you

SAM
Once

Deirdre gives Sam a look -- and he returns it Finally

Deirdre turns to Larry

LARRY
I drive -- and my name is Larry
from the States

DEIRDRE
(she turns to Vincent)
And who are you

VINCENT
Im Vincent And I coordinate

SAM
(sharply)
Coordinate what

VINCENT

Larry

Things This is my country you know
The two men exchange another look A pecking order is
developing among the group Vincent and Sam are both natural
leaders and now theyre feeling one another out

DEIRDRE
(to Vincent)

Coordinate all you want but make sure
whatever you do gets cleared through me
(Vincent doesnt respond for a

moment)
Are we in sync on this Vincent

VINCENT
Of course

Deirdre waits a BEAT letting Vincent know what she isnt any
more intimidated by him than he is by her Finally she
turns to Swede

SWEDE
They call me Swede

LARRY
Whos they

SWEDE
Everybody

VINCENT
And what is it you do

SWEDE
Me
(with a smile)
I kill

CUT TO
INT A WAREHOUSE - DAY

A PAPER TARGET in the shape of a human being dances in
place as it is riddles with GUNSHOTS each shot hitting the
target in the belly each shot fired by - Larry whose been
shooting a sleek automatic pistol from which hes just
discharged an entire clip The gun is empty Larry turns to
Sam who stands next in line

SAM
(looking at the target)
You shoot alright

LARRY
Gets the job done

SAM
All in the stomach though Your man
might live

LARRY
Not for long

SAM
Long enough to shoot back

LARRY
Is that right

SAM
Its been known to happen

LARRY
(a challenge)
Why dont you go do better then

Without a word Sam pops a new clip into the gun and SHOOTS
THE LIGHTS out of several other human targets hitting each
target in a different place One he clips between the eyes
the next in the heart one in the groin and then the last
target - He SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE firing shot after shot
from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in
half Larry is impressed in spite of himself

LARRY
Yeah well My way works too

SAM
My way is better

IN A CORNER OF THE WAREHOUSE -

Gregor has set up a table loaded with computers and
electronic whizmos Right now Gregor is holding a
particularly high-tech type CELL PHONE in his hands looking
at it almost lovingly

DEIRDRE (0S)
Is it alright

ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre sits nearby looking at the cell
phone

GREGOR
Its quite satifactory
DEIRDRE
Good because it cost enough Theres
cheaper phones by far than that one man
you better fucking use it

GREGOR

(almost caressing the phone)
I intend to This phone is wired like no
other its got an encryption chip and
instant sat-a-link recognition it can
talk to any computer in any language and
make it understand With my custom
hardware and this phone I can trace the
targets cell phone signature and follow
him anywhere he goes

DEIRDRE
You sure about this

GREGOR
Id stake my reputation

DEIRDRE
But would you stake your life thats the
question

GREGOR

In this business your life and your
reputation are more often than not one
and the same

From off screen we hear MUNCHING Its - Larry inhaling a
sandwich A malicious look comes over Swedes face whos
cleaning a pistol and sitting near Larry

SWEDE
You should watch what you eat

LARRY
Who the fuck died and appointed you food
czar

SWEDE

Im just worried about your health
Larry You could stand to shed a few
pounds

LARRY
(sensitive about his weight)
And you could stand to get a little
smarter aint that right you dumb blonde
fuck
SWEDE
(sensitive about the dumb
blonde thing)
Who you calling dumb dickless

Both men eyeball one another and then suddenly Larry reaches
for his piece and as soon as he does this Swede does the
same thing but before they can do anything - DEIRDRES GUN
swings INTO FRAME smashing Swede in the face and dropping
him to the floor Larrys mouth drops open in surprise but
its too late Deirdre kicks him in the stomach and then
rabbit punches him in the back of the neck driving him to
the ground

DEIRDRE

(standing above them)
Next one of you fuckers plays this game
Im going to do for you myself I wont
say it again we dont have time for this
shit Theres a clock running on this
job gentlemen and I mean to be on
schedule

A TENSE MOMENT as Deirdre stares down at these tough guys --
letting them know whos in charge A SOUND from OFF SCREEN
interrupts this moment a DOOR opening as we see - Vincent
who stands in the door wearing his coat and hat

Hes been out somewhere and he looks first at the squabbling
men and then at - Deirdre She gives Vincent a little nod --
a silent command that makes Vincent turn to Sam

VINCENT
Lets go for a ride

Vincent and Sam start off moving towards the door while Swede
and larry slowly pick themselves up off the ground

SAM
Where to

VINCENT
To see a man about a thing

SAM
I can do that

EXT THE WAREHOUSE - SUNSET

A DESOLATE URBAN LANDSCAPE - Sam and Vincent walking away
from the warehouse which is housed in what looks to be the
toughest neighborhood in the city filled with CHEAP CONCRETE
PUBLIC HOUSING and INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS

THE SETTING SUN throws a red glow on the street giving the
raw concrete buildings a blood-colored tint as Sam and
Vincent approach a FIAT a car neither too old nor too new
Before they can reach the car the two men are intercepted by
FOUR TOUGHS young guys in their early twenties The LEADER
of the Toughs apporaches Vincent

LEADER
(subtitled French)
Who gave you permission to park here

SAM
(to Vincent)
Whats he saying

VINCENT
Pretty much what youd expect

SAM
(with a sigh)
Thats what I thought

LEADER
(in French)
Theres a charge for parking on our
block

fq

The other Toughs add lib a few tough guy remarks (in French
of course)

VINCENT
(to Sam)
He says this is their block

SAM
As in they own it

VINCENT
Something like that

SAM
And I suppose hes saying that we oughta
give them something for using it huh

VINCENT
I didnt know that you spoke French

SAM
I dont But the language hes speaking
is universal

ANGLE ON THE LEADER - Whos smirking at Vincent and Sam
Sams words make a great deal of sense the Leader is
speaking the universal language of give me some money or
Ill kick your ass

SAM (0S)
I guess we oughta give them something

CUT BACK TO Vincent and Sam

VINCENT
If you think we should

Vincent backfists the Leader in the nose -- hitting him so
hard that the Leader skitters back on unsteady feet and then
sits down on his ass This blow hurt but the real damage is
to the Leaders pride Now - One of the Toughs rushes at
Sam only to have Sam perform what looks like a jujitsu throw
which savagely jerks the Tough off his feet and flattens him

SAM
(as if it were an accident)
Oh man I am sorry about that
(he sticks his hand out)
Let me give you a hand

Sam reaches down as if to help the Tough who ignores the
hand and totters to his feet As soon as hes up he turns
and runs away followed by the other Toughs Now only the
leader is left behind He looks for a second at Vincent and
Sam and then turns and runs after his friends Vincent
calls after him in French but whatever he says isnt
translated Vincent turns to unlock the car

SAM
Whatd you say to him

VINCENT
I asked if we could give him anything

else

By now the two men are in the car which starts up and drives
off as it does we -

CUT TO
INT THE FIAT - SAME TIME

VINCENT
That was a nice move you did on our young
friend Judo

SAM
Jujitsu

VINCENT
Same thing isnt it

SAM
Not at all Similar but not the same

VINCENT
Whats the difference

SAM
Ones a lot more painful than the other

Vincent laughs and Sam looks out the window at the city of
Paris as we MOVE THROUGH to the outside world of -

EXT PARIS DRIVING MONTAGE - TWILIGHT

A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS of the car driving through Paris at
night We dont see familiar sights like the Eiffel Tower or
the Arc de Triomph but instead - We travel through the LEFT
BANK down a series of Mazy Alleys which twist and turn
filled with bistros bars and falafel joints NEON SIGNS
line the streets for as far as the eye can see Near the end
of this trip we hear the SOUND OF A MATCH FLARING followed
by -

SAM (VO)
Could I get one of those

INT THE CAR - STILL DRIVING - SAME TIME

Vincent is driving and smoking a cigarette He tosses his
pack to Sam but he seems a little surprised at Sams
request

VINCENT
Help yourself
(quick beat)
Since when do you smoke

SAM
(lighting up)
I have I dont know maybe a cigarette a
week

VINCENT
A cigarette As in one
(exasperated almost to

himself)
One cigarette a week who smokes like
that

SAM
I do

VINCENT
Christ I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day
and I tell myself I could be worse
(takes a satisfying drag)
Its just so damned pleasurable

SAM
(blowing a smoke ring with
great skill)
It has its moments
(stubs out cigarette)
Course you get cancer and die thats
the down side

VINCENT
(with a sigh)
There is that

Vincent stamps his cigarette out looking vaguely unhappy
that Sam has spoiled his smoke

SAM
So Vincent why bring me along for the
ride Job like this calls for a warm
body somebody who can stand around and
look threatening A tough guy

VINCENT
Like Larry or Swede

SAM
Exactly Why not bring them

VINCENT
Lets just say I thought the
conversational possibilities were
limited Of course I might have brought
Gregor but he didnt seem like the right
candidate -- for this

SAM
Watch that one hes an ex-spook for
sure maybe Stasi maybe KGB Hes
smart Gregor is
VINCENT
So is the woman

SAM
Deirdre Smart yeah and seriously
goddamned dangerous

VINCENT
I wonder if she truly left the IRA

SAM
Ive wondered that myself None of this
answers my question though
(suddenly direct)
Why bring me

VINCENT
I wanted to see who you were

SAM
Who am I

Vincent driving all the while gives Sam a sideways glance
before speaking

VINCENT

You were once some kind of special
forces Airborne Ranger maybe a Navy
SEAL After that you rode shotgun for
the CIA in some place like El Salvador or
Afghanistan a real mercenary

(beat)
Only now -- now youre like the rest of
us its a very competitive market since
the end of the cold war Theres a lot
of hired guns out here and not nearly
enough work to go around

SAM
Thats right theres not hardly enough
work these days nothing that pays the
big money anyhow Then along comes this
job paying so much goddamned money I
couldnt afford not to take it Somebodys
paying through the nose for this

VINCENT
They certainly are Whatever it is were
going to steal it must be quite
something
SAM
Whatever it is it must be goddamned
priceless

And on that thought we -
CUT TO
EXT A SIDE STREET - NIGHT

The Fiat pulls up to the curb and Vincent and Sam get out
Vincent leads Sam around a corner and they come to -

AN EXQUISITE PARK a small perfectly manicured place -- a
kind of mini-Luxembourg Gardens in the middle of nowhere
When Sam sees the park he draws an involuntary breath

VINCENT
Lovely isnt it

SAM
Theyd have to keep something like this
under lock and key in New York and it
would still get fucked up

The two men enter the park which is indeed open to the
public Inside sitting on a bench in the back almost
invisible from the street we see - FRANCOIS a stubble-faced
tough with a stained shirt and bad teeth Vincent and Sam
draw near This next conversation between Francois and
Vincent is in FRENCH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES

FRANCOIS
Thats good right where you are Vincent

Vincent signals for Sam to stop Both Vincent and Sam are
still several feet away from Francois

VINCENT
Do you have it

FRANCOIS
Not so fast
(nods slightly to Sam)
Whos that

VINCENT
Hes company

FRANCOIS
(as if he recognizes Sam)
Bad company
VINCENT
What do you mean

FRANCOIS
Hes a cop Vincent hes French and hes
a cop and you better shoot him in the
fucking head right now

Sam hasnt said a word -- he doesnt seem to understand
whats been said but he has noted the urgency with which
Francois spoke Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT Neither Vincent
nor Francois pulls out a piece to shoot Sam Instead they
wait to see if Sam will respond in any way to what Francois
said The conversation now switches to ENGLISH which (it
turns out) Francois speaks fairly well

SAM
(to Vincent)
Whats going on

VINCENT
I just wanted to see something

SAM
(that edge creeping into his
voice)
See what

Vincent isnt going to answer but the overbearing Francois
chimes in

FRANCOIS
He wanted to see how you reacted when I
said that you were a cop

SAM
(he cant believe this)
You told him I was a cop

FRANCOIS
He asked me to say it

SAM
looking at Vincent truly
pissed)
He asked you to

VINCENT
I needed to know

SAM
You need to know a lot of shit Vincent

FRANCOIS
(to Vincent in subtitled
French)
Are you ready

Francoiss French words give Sam pause -- hes wondering
whats being said as - Vincent moves towards Francois
leaving Sam several steps away The conversation is again in
SUBTITLED FRENCH

VINCENT
(taking out an envelope)
Heres yours

FRANCOIS
Theres been a slight problem

VINCENT
(immediately tensing)
Whats that

Francois gives the slightest of nods indicating that Vincent
should look towards a place perhaps thirty yards away -

A COPSE OF TREES where we see a SNIPER pointed a telescopic
rifle at Vincent

FRANCOIS

(still in subtitled French)
If you say a word in English Vincent my
friend with the high powered sporting
rifle will shoot you in the throat
Sorry to screw you over like this but
the information you want might get me
killed if I give it to you and thats a
price Im not willing to pay

VINCENT
(in French)
I take it you still want the money

FRANCOIS
(in English with a grin)
Of course

SAMS POV Looking at Vincent and Francois

The men are talking and from here we cant really hear them
speak All Sam can see is an earnest Vincent listening to
Francois talk almost as if Francois is giving Vincent
instructions Now - Vincent reaches into his pocket
reaching for the envelope of cash hes carrying As he hands
the money to Francois Vincent uses his free hand to pull out
his gun while - Sam already has his gun out -- somehow he
figured out what was going on -- and now Francois looks on in
stunned disbelief as -

Sam fires a single shot hitting Francois in the shoulder
driving him away from - Vincent who now squeezes off several
rapid fire shots at the sniper while - Francois bleeding
but still very much alive now has his piece free just as -
The Sniper his gun firing wildly into the air falls to the
ground shot dead by Vincent and now - Francois is drawing a
bead on Vincent when - Sam hits Francois with a fusillade of
bullets in the chest and now - A SINGLE SPENT BULLED CASING
flies through the air in SLOW MOTION and lands on the ground
spinning around until it comes to a halt and - A HEAVY
SILENCE FALLS as the last echo of the last gunshot finally
dies Vincent and Sam look at one another see that theyre
still alive and then look back at - The two men theyve
shot Francois isnt quite dead Blood bubbles from his
lips as Vincent leans over him Again they speak in
SUBTITLED FRENCH

VINCENT
Wheres my information

FRANCOIS
(with a grim smile pointing to
his head)
In here
VINCENT

Then you better find it in your heart to
tell me Francois because while your
death is inevitable it still isnt
decided how painful its going to be

A LONG ANGLE - Vincent whispers in Francoiss ear whose grin
blanches as he realizes Vincent means to hurt him Francois
whispers something back and then - BANG Vincent shoots
Francois in the head killing him instantly Then Vincent
bends down and retrieves the envelope of money which Francois
had tucked inside his shirt As Vincent does this Sam comes
up from behind

SAM
Now would be a good time to get the fuck
out of here

INT THE FIAT - LATERNIGHT

The two men drive in silence for a moment Vincent lights a
cigarette and offers one to Sam who refuses Finally

speaks

A BEAT

cut To

SAM
You know what you pulled back there
that was bullshit

VINCENT

I needed to see if you were a cop

(defensively)
Im a popular man with the police Sam
and whenever they try to catch me they
always do it with an inside guy -- some
man on some job who seems more
trustworthy than all the others put
together And thats the guy you have to
watch out for

(beat)
I hate cops

SAM
(insulted that Vincent would
even consider it)
Well I aint a cop

the two men driving in silence

VINCENT
How did you know

SAM
Know what

VINCENT
That there was a gun pointed at me

SAM
I saw you look off when Francois nodded
his head I figured he wasnt pointing
out a particularly rare shrub and the
rest was easy

VINCENT
But how did you know I would have the
presence of mind to pull my weapon
when I did

SAM
(as if its obvious)
Because thats what I would have done

Sam
EXT AN APARTMENT HOUSE - A LITTLE LATERNIGHT

Vincents Fiat is parked at the curb in front of this

apartment house Vincent and Sam exit
towards the house -- a silence hanging
before they go into the house Vincent
full of cash that was supposed to have
thinks for a moment and then hands the

VINCENT
You saved my life back there
I know this doesnt begin to
right between us

Vincents voice trails off -- he doesn

the car and move
between them Right
takes out the envelope
been for Francois He
whole envelope to Sam

in the park
make it

t know what to say

Sam takes the money out of the envelope -- half he keeps for

himself the other he gives to Vincent

SAM

same team
(holding up the money)

What I did back in the park I did because
were working together -- we

re on the

This is business -- this is work We did

split

it together we share the spoils even

Sam opens the door to the house but Vincent has one last

thing to say to him

VINCENT
I owe you a heavy debt

Sam almost smiles cynically at this debts of honor dont

seem to be something he believes in

SAM
Whatever you say

They enter the house and the door closes behind them A

second later we hear -

DEIRDRE (VO)

Whatd you do with the money

INT THE HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Vincent and Sam sit with Deirdre in a room alone Theyve

told her about the park and she seems
all of this

a little pissed about
VINCENT
We kept it

DEIRDRE
(a little annoyed)
Is that right

SAM
Hazard pay

DEIRDRE
(with an exhalation of disgust)
The two of you were supposed to go toa
simple meet and come back with a simple
piece of information and instead you
went to fucking war

SAM
We werent real thrilled about it
either

Deirdre shakes her head in disgust and rises We FOLLOW HER
INTO -

AN ADJOINING ROOM -

Where Larry Swede and Gregor are waiting They look up
expectantly at Deirdre who crosses through the room without
stopping -- shes really pissed about this turn of events

LARRY
So whats the deal

DEIRDRE
(barely stopping very
snappish)
The deal The deal is we leave for Nice
at first light

And she exits leaving these three men behind along with Sam
and Vincent who have entered from the other room larry
looks at the two of them

LARRY
Whatd you guys do

EXT OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

A CAR sits cloaked in shadows Inside sits our friend the
WATCHER Once again we see the Watchers knife -- once again
he manicures his nails with it almost delicately as he
watches the House Its dark -- a single light glows behind
a window on the third floor Sams room
INT SAMS ROOM - SAME TIME

Sam has pushed all the furniture aside to make enough room to
do a martial arts form Right now hes frozen one leg
extended in a kick balancing on the other leg Now - A
KNOCK at his door -- seconds later it opens Deirdre stands
there watching as Sam holds his position for a BEAT more
and then retracts his leg

DEIRDRE
I feel as if Ive wandered onto the set
of Enter The Dragon Could you teach me
to do that

SAM
didnt think to see you again tonight
You were pretty pissed

DEIRDRE
still am

SAM
s that right

DEIRDRE
Thats right

Deirdre spings at Sam throwing martial arts combinations at
him punch followed by kick elbow strike followed by palm
thrust Sam parries her blows as she drives him across the
floor until hes got his back to the wall Their movements
are controlled but powerful and theres something almost
flirtatious about the whole thing Now -

Deirdre throws one last punch which Sam ducks He slips
behind her and suddenly they square off in earnest The
previous martial arts stuff was a kind of choreographed
exercise but now - They spar for real -- they never hit one
another but they come awfully close hands and feet whizzing
through the air throwing rapid-fire combinations and
techniques Theyre not angry but theyre not kidding
either Finally - Deirdre feints a punch that distracts
Sams attention from - The KICK she throws right behind her
punch and she smiles as - WHUMP Sam wasnt distracted at
all -- he drops to the ground beneath her kick and catches
her standing leg with a sweep which takes her to the ground
and now - Shes trapped beneath him The two of them are
breathing hard from the exertion their faces close to one
another shining with sweat and excitement and - Weve gone
from flirting to an almost primal seduction and with their
faces only inches apart Deirdre leans in to kiss Sam
hes about to meet her half way when he pulls back

SAM
Part of me says I should just look at

this as a perk You know a bonus But

then I remember youre you -- Deirdre

who used to belong to the IRA -- and it
occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge

come very naturally to you

DEIRDRE
(kissing him very lightly)
Nobodys saying they dont

SAM
(returning the kiss just as
lightly)
And when I consider that I have to
wonder if you dont have some ulterior
motive for being here with me right
now

DEIRDRE
I probably do
(pulling him close)
But for the time being Im willing to
forget about it

and

They finally kiss slowly and then building in intensity

as they start to make love the

CAMERA MOVES UP - THROUGH THE BUILDING floor by floor

weve reached -

EXT A ROOFTOP GARDEN - MEANWHILE

Deirdre and Sam are not the only ones indulging in

and

until

extracurricular activities Up here in this rooftop garden

we find Swede and Gregor talking in hushed tones

GREGOR
would imagine that the great
satisfaction in all of this will be
illing the American

SWEDE
(we know this isnt true)

me Gregor -- I take no pleasure in

but I dont get off on it

hadnt thought about it Understand

illing It doesnt bother me one bit
GREGOR
A means to an end is that it

SWEDE
Thats it

GREGOR
(he rises to leave)
Then I guess were set

SWEDE
There is one other thing

GREGOR
Whats that

Suddenly Swede pulls Gregor down to the rooftop with a harsh
THUD Within seconds he has his gun pressed to Gregors
head

GREGOR
What are you doing

SWEDE
Dont cross me

GREGOR
Nobodys going to do that

SWEDE
Really

GREGOR
(truly frightened)
I need you Swede I cant do this
without you

SWEDE
(beat then he puts his gun
away)
I just wanted to make sure you knew who
you were dealing with

GREGOR
I do I do

Swede is now on his feet walking away back into the
apartment house

SWEDE
(this is almost to himself)
Just remember it then

And hes gone And as soon as he is we notice something
strange about Gregor hes not the least bit scared -- he
laughs a little low laugh as we -

DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE HOUSE - DAWN

GRAY LIGHT seeps in from the horizon while inside in -
INT SAMS ROOM - SAME TIME

Deirdre is pulling her dress over her head Sam seems to be
sleeping in his bed as she moves like a cat towards the door
when -

Sams HAND reaches out gently yet firmly and takes her by
the arm

SAM (0S)
No goodbye

ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam is somehow sitting up wide awake --
looking at Deirdre with a penetrating glance

DEIRDRE
Look Sam dont take it the wrong way
when I tell you we wont be doing this

again

SAM
You dont have to explain yourself to me
Deirdre

DEIRDRE

(almost surprised by this)
know I dont have to Sam its just
that for once I want to when I was a -
(almost with a sneer)
Patriot it was a given Id sleep with
any man it was deemed necessary for me to
sleep with You know any man who needed
setting up Sometimes so we might
blackmail him sometimes so he could be
illed

(a quick beat)
Sometimes so I could kill him myself
RA isnt exactly an enlightened feminist
organization Sam To most of the men I
with I was always the girl Send the girl

to do it Tell The girl to take care of
it Have the girl fuck him

(a quick beat)
But I look at you and I get this feeling
you take me for what I am no more no

less

SAM
Youre a hired gun Deirdre -- just like
me

DEIRDRE

Exactly And last night I wanted to be
with someone who was just like me

Somewhere in all of this Deirdre has sat back down on the
bed and somehow now shes only inches away from Sam
Theyre lips brush and -

A MUTED PHONE RINGS in a nearby room breaking the moment A
QUICK BEAT then -

DEIRDRE
I better be getting that

SAM
Duty calls

DEIRDRE
(with a trace of a sigh)
Just business

Deirdre gives Sam a light kiss on the lips and then she opens
his door The muted phone is a little louder now Deirdre
closes Sams door as she exits but - Sam reaches out a hand
and catches the door right before it snaps shut He watches
THROUGH THE DOOR CRACK as - Deirdre cross the hall and

opens the door to her room and now the phone rings loudly
until the door shuts muting the sound once again shutting
Sam out The phone stops ringing as Deirdre answers and as
this happens Sam shuts his door and as the door closes we go
to - BLACK Just for a second And then - BLINDING SUN hits
us in the eyes as we find ourselves above -

EXT NICE - DAY

A DAZZLING OVERHEAD MOVING SHOT establishing that weve
changed locales moved to a place filled with sun and blue
water and reflective surfaces the Cote dAzure We start to
MOVE DOWN TOWARDS -

EXT A PRIVATE BEACH - NICE - MEANWHILE
A TOPLESS GRANDMA reclines on a beach chair soaking up rays
sipping a drinnk just delivered by a young stud of a WAITER
Nearby -

AT A ROUND TABLE -

A nice distance from anyone who might try to listen in we
find our group Deirdre Sam Vincent Gregor Swede and
Larry Food and drink surround them Larry is of couse
still eating

DEIRDRE
Now then lets run through it one more
time shall we
(to Gregor)
Whats your job

GREGOR
I use my cell phone to get computer
access to the telecommunications
satellite used by our target I trace
his cell phone signature and use it to
pin point his location as he moves
through Nice relaying that information

to you
DEIRDRE
(to Larry)
Next
LARRY

(a sigh hes done this too

many times)
You call me with the targets route I
follow along until weve reached the
attack point and then I run his squag ass
off the road

DEIRDRE
(to Swede)
Which leads us to

SWEDE
I ride with fat-boy

LARRY
(under his breath)
Eat shit and die slowly

SWEDE
After we stop the target car I get out
and use the heavy artillery to kill the
driver and his bodyguard

LARRY
I blast the lead car into oblivion

VINCENT
(picking up)
While Sam and I take out the back two
cars

DEIRDRE
Leaving

SWEDE
(picking it up)
Leaving me to step in drop the target
in the back seat and get the package

DEIRDRE
(with a quick look at Sam)
While

SAM
(returning her look)
While I back him up making sure to
get the package if something goes wrong
and somebody takes Swede down

Nobody else seems to notice this look between them but we
should -- if only to note that theres something about the
way Deirdre queries Sam about his role and something about
the way Sam answers her without overly reacting -- theyre
not flirting but theres a kind of acknowledgment of the
history they now have between them But -- nobody else
notices and Swedes line follows Sams without breaking the
flow of the dialogue

SWEDE
Nobodys taking me anywhere

DEIRDRE
And then

LARRY
Then Swede and I split with the package
and meet you back at the rendezvous

DEIRDRE
And then

VINCENT
And then Sam you and I clean up
whatevers left to be cleaned

DEIRDRE
Very good Now all we have to do is live
long enough to get paid

EXT A POSH HOTEL - LATER - NIGHT

A ROW OF ROOMS each one with a light behind a shade Even
as we watch the light in each room goes off one two three
four five six lights -- one for each member of the team The
night before the big event nobody breaks curfew

ACROSS THE STREET -
A BAR -

Through the bar window we see the Watchers silhouette A
match flares as the Watcher lights a cigarette REVEALING his
face for the first time weathered sharp treacherous THE
MATCH goes out and the Watchers face FADES TO BLACK and so
do we

The DRUMS
continue to play and their volume is still low but theyre
jarring setting our nerves on edge

INT THE VOLVO

LARRY
Where is this broad

SWEDE
You should learn a little patience

LARRY
Is that right

SWEDE
Its consider a virtue in some corners
of the world

LARRY
Not in mine

THE CAR PHONE rings and Swede pushes a button Deirdres
Voice is heard on the speaker phone

DEIRDRE (VO)
Hello gentlemen are we ready

EXT THE CAFE

Deirdre looks at her laptop and relays Gregors instructions
She speaks over her headset as if shes conducting ordinary
business -- as if shes giving someone traffic directs

over the phone The JAPANESE DRUMS continue quiet and yet
intense

DEIRDRE
You want to take a left then so that
youre going west

During this next sequence the DRUMS will continue to play
building with the action as we do -

THE CHASE MONTAGE A SERIES OF CUTS AS -
The Volvo takes a flying left turn -

Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards
the Promenade des Anglais typing the results on his

keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill hits a
bump and flies through the air a good fifteen feet even as -
The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump does

the same flight through the air and lands with a thud -
THE CARAVAN of cars -

THE TARGET CAR -

THE TARGET still talking away on his cell phone - THE
COMPUTER MAP tracking the Targets movements as the Map

shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target and now -

The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build
to a crescendo as -

The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind
together as —

CARS 3 and 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincents Fiat
which forces them to slam to a halt as -

Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS
stop

Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo and Swede brandishes a
MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN with which he opens fire a blast
of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire smashing
against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car which is bullet-
proof The windshield doesnt break right away -- but the
heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle

Sam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat guns drawn blazing
away at BODYGUARDS and Christ theres an army of them
pouring out of Cars 3 and 4 These guys are armed and returning
fire as -

Larry gets out of the drivers seat of the Volvo and hes
got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself a ROCKET LAUNCHER
which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as
it scorches the air traveling towards -

The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized
whats going on behind it and as frantic Bodyguards drive
back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS blowing the
Car sideways

Meanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other
Bodyguards and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a
team each man with a gun in both hands using a weapon until
its out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new
one

And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray
firing both of her pistols taking Sams place at Vincents
side so that Sam can run towards -
looks

The Target Car where the Target is seated in the backseat
pulling out his own piece ready to fight to the death
himself as -

Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his
monster gun and now - The Windshield has started to crack
and splinter and abruptly it shatters instantly bursting a
bright red as Swedes bullets tear up the body of the Driver

Now Sam has reaches the Target Car just as the Target who
is armed and as we know not exactly helpless steps out of
the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING Sam fires
winging the Target knocking the gun out of his hand and
still the Target wont give up without a struggle he hits
Swede with the Briefcase

THE TARGET
Fuck you

SWEDE
Not today

BANG Swede puts one shot between the Targets eyes ending
his life Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO the smaller of the
two traditional Japanese Samurai swords With one slashing
blow he hacks off the Targets HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs

the briefcase The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the
handcuffs so that it is carried along for the ride Now -
DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back
towards Larry and the Volvo and as he goes he raises the
briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to
Sam who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent who
have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards and now the
SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW
MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent
are already at Vincents Fiat waiting for Sam and so they
dont notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire
time and now the vans side door slides open and unseen by
any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van a gun at his
side and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry
and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat and now he

back and sees - Gregor crossing the street and now - Sam
screams a warning to Larry but its way too late because -
Swede shoots Larry in the neck hitting him above the
protective covering of his bullet proof vest Now were
MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup
piece drawn a snub-nosed 38 and he fires all six shots
into - Swede hitting him in the stomach -- its the same way
Larry shot the target in the warehouse Swede is sent flying
backwards where he crashes to the pavement For a second we
think hes dead but then he gets up in pain but alive just
as Sam predicted Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he
too wears a bullet proof vest By now - Larry has rolled out
of the Volvo crawling away but too weak to go far and now -
Swede has Larry in his sights hes going to kill him

SWEDE
I dont particularly like killing tubby
but I want you to know that this one Im
going to enjoy

LARRY
(sees something over Swedes
shoulder)
I dont think so

Swede turns to follow Larrys gaze and as he does - Gregor
walks INTO FRAME and puts his gun right beneath Swedes chin
Before Swede can even compute this Gregor pulls the trigger
firing straight up into Swedes brain Then without even
looking at Larry who is lying helpless on the ground -

Gregor takes the briefcase and gets into the Volvo driving
off just as - Sam arrives kneeling down by Larry The SIRENS
get louder

LARRY
(in shock)
He justI dont believe that son-of-

a

Vincents Fiat comes peeling to a halt in front of them
Vincent and Deirdre inside it as Sam manages to get Larry
into the back seat Sam doesnt get in the car yet as Larry
says -

LARRY
(still having trouble believing
it)
Weve been crossed

The SIRENS reach a crescendo as a group of GENDARMES arrive
charging with automatic weapons drawn Between the French
cops and our heroes lies the shot up wreck of the Target Car
and now - Sam takes out a GRENADE pulls the pin and rolls
it across the ground beneath the Mercedes which the cops
have just reached Seconds later - The Car EXPLODES cutting
off the cops and as this happens Vincents puts the pedal to
the floor and gets the fuck out of Dodge We start to SLOWLY
PULL BACK on the remains of this battle the dead bodies the
shot up cars the broken glass and that flaming smoking
hulk of a Mercedes in the middle of the street
DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE OLD CITYNICE - SUNSET

The FIREBALL of the car turns into a BLOOD RED SUN as it sets
in the Western sky tinting the stone buildings of the Old
City a coppery red

Were MOVING THROUGH the Old City through the twists and
turns of what an American would call back alleys but that
pass for streets in this place It is quiet almost deserted
then - A TESTOSTERONE CRAZED PLAYBOY whips his sports car
through one of these streets engine whining as we - MOVE
DOWN yet another side street and this sucker really is a
back alley you couldnt get a car down here if you tried
Finally we come to - A RAT TRAP OF AN OLD BUILDING and we
PUSH TIGHT on this building as we hear -

LARRY (V0O)
What is this

INT A BACK APARTMENT - SAME TIME

A SYRINGE is plunged into Larrys arm Sam is tending to
Larrys wound Sam seems to know what hes doing as Larry
is also hooked up to a bottle of plasma hanging on a make-
shift stand

SAM
(answering Larrys question)
Its a cocktail Mostly demerol cut
with a little crank because we might need
you awake in the real near future

LARRY

Fine with fucking me we got work to do
I dont care what it takes we are
getting our property back and putting it
into the hands of the people who are
gonna pay us a great deal of money when
we do I dont know about the rest of you
guys but Im not the kind of guy
to just sit back and take it in the ass

(a quick beat)
I dont mean that in like a literal
way

DEIRDRE
Of course

VINCENT
Finding this package is a thing easier
said than done We dont even know what
it is

(he looks at Deirdre and

suddenly hes deadly earnest)
What did we steal

DEIRDRE
(suddenly defensive)
I dont know

VINCENT
When this whole thing started you made it
clear youre running the show And I
dont believe youd be running this show
if you didnt know what was going on

DEIRDRE
Well I dont

VINCENT
And I dont believe you

Vincents gun is out in the blink of an eye at Deirdres
head but shes as fast as he is and her gun is drawn as
well jammed into his stomach

DEIRDRE
(suddenly feral)
You go shoot me if you want Vincent but
youll be dead before I hit the ground

VINCENT
(matching her intensity)
I dont want you dead woman I want the
the truth

SAM (0S)
(with a dead cool in his voice)
Both of you

ANOTHER ANGLE - Sam has the two of them covered with his gun -
an interesting moment because he can shoot either Deirdre or
Vincent but not both at the same time The question is
whose side is he on

SAM
(continuing without missing a
beat)
put your guns down and chill out

A BEAT And then Vincent and Deirdre lower their weapons
followed by Sam
SAM
Like it or now were on the same side
were here and the package isnt
(looks at Deirdre)
Youre not the boss any more youre our
partner So tell us what you know so we
can figure a way out of this mess

Sams look isnt romantic but it implies a level of trust
based upon their physical intimacy

SAM
Now what did we steal

DEIRDRE

(she hates to admit this)
I dont know

(defensively off Vincents

look)
Well I dont Its a goddamned mystery
to me just like it is to you

(quick beat then reluctantly

continuing)
But I do know who were working for My
people and the Russian mob

LARRY
Your people Who the fuck is your
people

VINCENT

Who do you think Larry The IRA

DEIRDRE
And you believed me
(passionately)
But it wasnt my people who did it

LARRY
How do we know that

SAM
Because if they had shed be gone along
with the package instead of sitting here
with us

DEIRDRE
Exactly Gregor he was the Russians
man It was my people came up with the
idea for this run but the Russians who
had the capital to finance it Gregor
he was their insurance and I was ours
Everybody else was supposed to be
neutral Gregor mustve got to Swede

LARRY
I never did trust that blonde fuck

DEIRDRE
Thats why you were riding with him

VINCENT
The question still remains what do we do
now

SAM
(he figures something out)
Gregors cell phone

LARRY
(to himself)
What are you gonna do call him up and
ask him to give us back our shit

SAM
(ignoring Larry to Deirdre)
Did he bring that with him

DEIRDRE
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he
was using it was in his contract Cost
a nice penny too especially that
goddamned phone Gregor had expensive
tastes

SAM

Check this out
(hes thinking on his feet)

Gregors a spook or he was one until
recently When he was a spy he lived the
life -- you know a prince in some
Eastern Bloc country where nobody had
shit and Gregor had everything Then the
wall goes down No more Cold War And
Gregor is out of a job No apartment no
special stores with Western food and
video tapes I would bet dollars against
shit that Gregor liked that phone and he
doesnt want to give it up And I
wouldnt be surprised if hes arrogant
enough to think

DEIRDRE
(finishing his sentence)
That were too stupid to trace his calls

Deirdre and Sam share the slightest of conspiratorial smiles
as they realize theyre both thinking the same thought they
might still win this one

EXT AIX EN PROVENCE - TWILIGHT

Were on perhaps the MOST BEAUTIFUL STREET in all of France
the Cours Mirabeau in the town of Aix

Outdoor cafes line the sides of the street while a canopy of
interlocking trees covers everything Now were - MOVING
DOWN THE STREET towards a CAFE where a DAPPER GENT sits
sipping a mineral water The Gent has a SATCHEL at his feet
Now - A JEEP pulls up to a nearby corner and idles in
neutral The Dapper Gent throws some bills on the table and
gets up crossing to - The Jeep A door opens and the
Dapper Gent carrying his satchel gets into the jeep which
drives off as we -

CUT TO
INT JEEP - SAME TIME

Gregor and the Dapper Gent drive in silence for minute down
the length of the Cours Mirabeau

GREGOR
(breaking the silence)
Its a beautiful street no

The Dapper Gent also has an accent a much thicker one than
Gregors its an accent that places the Gent as a resident
of what used to be called the Soviet Union

DAPPER GENT
(he cant wait any longer)
Do you have it

GREGOR
Always in a rush you are All these
years Ive known you you could never
wait for anything

DAPPER GENT
This is important

GREGOR
Do you really think so
DAPPER GENT
You know it is

Gregor still driving takes out a SILENCED PISTOL and the
Dapper Gent reaches for his own piece

GREGOR
Relax

The Dapper Gent loweres his hand leaving his gun in his coat
Gregor pulls the van to a curb

GREGOR
Look over there

GREGOR and THE GENTS POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - A GROUP OF
CHILDREN are playing

GREGOR (0S)
Do you see that one The girl in the
light blue dress

We find one particular LITTLE GIRL around eight holding the
end of a jump rope wearing a light blue dress Shes
breathtakingly beautiful and now - Gregor raises his
silenced pistol as if to shoot her

DAPPER GENT
What are you doing have you lost your
mind

Gregor pulls the trigger as he does so the Dapper Gent jogs
his arm and we hear the soft thwpfft of the silenced shot
just as the shot goes off - Missing its mark harmlessly
shooting into a tree causing a SINGLE LEAF to float to the
ground behind the playing children Nobody notices a thing
BEAT The Dapper Gent is visibly shaken because there is no
doubt that Gregor would have killed the Girl if the Gent
hadnt ruined his aim

DAPPER GENT
Why did you do that

GREGOR
To make a point I dont know her and I
was ready to splatter her brains all over
the sidewalk
(giving the Gent a look)
I dont particularly like you so imagine
what Ill do if you try anything

Gregor leaves his gun dangling in the air a moment longer than
necessary and then starts the jeep as we -
CUT TO
EXT A COUNTRY ROAD OUTSIDE OF AIX - NIGHT

A FULL MOON casts a silver light over a field of wild grass
A soft wind blows and the grass moves gently from side to
side Now - Gregors JEEP glides down this road as we MOVE
THROUGH TO -

INT THE JEEP - SAME TIME

DAPPER GENT
(squirming)
Enough Weve been driving for an hour
where is my package

Gregor smiles -- hes been waiting for this He pulls the
jeep over and looks at the Dapper Gent

GREGOR
Its under your seat

DAPPER GENT
(incredulous)
What

GREGOR
As my American friend Larry would say
are you fucking deaf Its under your
seat

The Dapper Gent looks down and sure enough the edge of the
Briefcase sticks out beneath the seat

DAPPER GENT
I cant believe youd do that Gregor I
thought I trained you better than that

With a laugh the Dapper Gent hands his satchel to Gregor
whose eyes literally dance with the prospect of his reward
He cant help himself he opens the satchel and there it is -
COLD HARD CASH in large bills enough for Gregor to live like

a prince for quite some time Gregor sucks in an involuntary
breath and then looks back up to see - The Dapper Gent hasnt
reached for the Briefcase Instead hes taken out his gun

and its only inches from Gregors head

DAPPER GENT
Ive never particularly liked you either
Gregor

The Dapper Gent yanks out the Briefcase and as he does -

THE SEVERED HAND comes whipping out along with it still
attached by the handcuff chain The Hand flies up in the
Dapper Gents face and we notice that the Hand is starting
to rot -- its bloated and swelling and horrific and it
scares the shit out of the Dapper Gent who drops his gun and
fumbles with the Briefcase as - THWPFFTwe hear the sound
of another silenced shot as we -

SMASH CUT TO
EXT OUTSIDE THE JEEP - SAME TIME

A DARK STAIN splashes against the passenger side window of
the jeep Seconds later - The door swings open and the
Dapper Gents body plunks out onto the ground A moment
later something wet and viscous plops down on the face of
the Gent as the jeep drives off Now - We HOLD FOR A BEAT on
the Dapper Gents dead body which lies in the silver
moonlight blood running out from beneath him while the
Severed Hand palms the Gents face fingers splayed out
around his head Now - We HEAR the sound of PHONE TONES

And not just any phone

INT THE JEEP - SAME TIME

Gregor finishes punching a number into his CELL PHONE We
hear a single ring on the other end of the phone before it is
picked up

PHONE VOICE (VO)
(in Russian English subtitles)
Is it done

GREGOR
(in English)
Its done

BEAT The Phone Voice doesnt respond for a moment -- whoever
this is they didnt expect to hear from Gregor The Voice
switches to English

PHONE VOICE (VO)
Gregor is that you

GREGOR
(with a low chuckle)
Much to your disappointment no doubt

PHONE VOICE (VO)
It was a mistake it shouldnt have
happened

GREGOR
(suddenly cold furious)
Im in the middle of saving you people a
great deal of money -- the least you
could do is have the decency to pay me

BEAT

PHONE VOICE (VO)
So what do we do

GREGOR
What I do is none of your concern What
you should do is wait for my next phone
call Im going to find a place where I
can tilt the field in my favor When Im
ready Ill call you and tell you what I
want you to do

The Phone Voice says something unintelligible in Russian cut
off by Gregor as he angrily snaps off his cell phone and we -

CUT TO
INT THE CHEAP APARTMENT - DAWN

Larry snores on the couch while Deirdre sleeps in a sleeping
bag on the floor Vincent sits in a ratty easy chair feet
propped on an overturned crate dozing lightly Suddenly -
Vincents eyes open warily as if something has changed in
the room He looks around - No Sam Vincent gets up takes
out his gun and silently gets to his feet He moves down a
long hall and - No Sam Now like a cat Vincent moves into -

THE BATHROOM pitch black He moves in swipes the string of
the overhead light and - nothing Nobodys here The only
place left is the front door and now Vincent approaches He
opens the door gun still at ready and moves out into -

INT THE LANDING OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

This is a small building There is no other apartment on
the floor At the far end of the landing there is a small
ladder which leads up to -

THE ROOF And the door which leads to the roof is flapping
in a light wind

EXT THE ROOF - SAME TIME
Vincent bursts onto the roof gun straight out finger on the
trigger only to find - Sam is there his gun pointed at
Vincent A BEAT then both men give little laughs and put
their weapons away like Samurai so trained in combat that
they know when its safe to relax

SAM
Whats going on

VINCENT
You werent around when I woke up I
thought maybe something had happened
(off Sams look)
This has been one very fucked up job
Sam and Im not taking any more chances
on anybody

(a quick beat)
Including you

In answer Sam takes out Vincents pack of cigarettes and
tosses them back to him Vincent looks almost delighted at
this

SAM
I came up here to sneak a smoke

VINCENT
You were smoking

SAM
I hope you dont mind I took your pack
It was on the table

VINCENT
(very sincere offering the
pack)
Please help yourself Smoke as many
youd like

Sam considers for a minute and then takes one Vincent does
so as well and he searches for his lighter which he cant
seem to find because - Sam has it and he lights their
cigarettes and then hands the lighter back to Vincent

SAM
(a shrug of the shoulders)
I borrowed that too

VINCENT
(puffing contentedly)
Of coursewhenever you feel like it
just help yourself

SAM
I have a feeling Im about to start
buying my own

BEAT The two men smoke in silence looking out at -
THE CURVED SHORELINE OF NICE -

Which glitters with thousands of lights from the apartment
buildings and a thousand more from the cars that travel on
the road that leads into town the Promenade des Anglais

VINCENT (0S)
That was a bad bit of business today

BACK ON Sam and Vincent

SAM
It was at that

VINCENT
A lot of people died

SAM
Ive seen a lot of people die before

VINCENT
I havent Not like that How do you
get used to it

SAM
You dont You just learn to live with
it

VINCENT
I wont lie -- there have been times when

I had to do it times when the only way
to get out alive was to see that the
other man didnt

SAM
We live in a singular world my friend

VINCENT
I never really thought I was part of the
world you move in Sam to tell you the
truth
(off his look)
Im a hood a thief Big time in a small
time king of way To the local police
Im a prize to the local hoods Ima
legend But to a guy like you Im just
another two bit hired gun

SAM
You might be a hired gun Vincent but I
got a feeling you cost more than two
bits

This conversation might have gone further but it is
interrupted when Deirdre pokes her head up onto the roof

DEIRDRE
Christ I was starting to think that the
two of you had thrown it in and walked
away
(to Vincent)

Theres someone on the phone downstairs
asking for you and my somewhat limited
French leads me to believe that he might
have something to tell us about Gregor

EXT THE HIGHWAY - LATER - NIGHT

A car we havent seen before a CITROEN hums up the French
highway in the night along on the road Its a postcard
moment but only for a moment

LARRY (VO)
Im telling you

INT THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

LARRY
(continuing)
That I could be dead and Id drive better
than you
Deirdre is driving and Larry -- much to his chagrin -- is in

the passenger seat watching her every move

DEIRDRE
(very curt)
Oh shut up

IN THE BACK SEAT -

Sam and Vincent have a MAP spread out Vincent is tracing
Gregors route so far and we follow his RED MAGIC MARKER as
it traces a line up the highway

VINCENT
Hes going north

(circles something on map)
Thats Aix en Provence where he used the
phone

Sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the
map Destination Paris

SAM
(making up his mind)
Hes going back

VINCENT
Not necessarily He could go off road at
any number of places He might not even
be in the country anymore

SAM
Its Paris The routes too indirect for
anything else A guy like Gregor he
doesnt waste time on this road unless he
has to be on it in the first place
Otherwise hed be out of the country by
now Hes going to Paris

(beat)
Now I just hope we can find him before he
gets there

DEIRDRE
If somebody else doesnt find him first

EXT THE TOWN OF ORANGE - DAY

Orange pronounced Au-Ronge is a mid-sized town of fifty
thousand souls It is small charming quaint and it has
one particular thing that no other town in France can claim -

AN ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER that has been painstakingly
restored We see this Roman Theater from the outside as we
MOVE THROUGH the streets of the town to the TOWN SQUARE
Its packed -- every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled
with a tourist having breakfast This normally quiet place
explodes one month out of the year when an internationally
famous music festival is held in the Roman Theater We come
upon -

A TABLE OF AMERICAN TOURISTS a Family Dad is angry at Mom

DAD
Opera This is an opera festival

MOM
I told you that Henry

DAD
I thought you meant Phantom of the Opera
You know Andrew Lloyd Weber Cats that
kind of thing

Mom and Dad continue their discussion but weve left them
behind MOVING THROUGH the seats and cafes until we get toa
cafe on the outskirts of the Town Square Here in the most
removed table in the entire Square we find Gregor sitting in
the shadow of the trellis Unless youre on top of him you
cant see him but he can see everything perfectly His cell
phone sits on the table in front of him -- he picks it up and
starts to punch in a number

CUT TO
EXT A REST STOP ON THE HIGHWAY - MEANWHILE

THE CITROEN is parked among a number of other cars Sam is
sleeping in the back seat while Vincent is seen on an
outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot
Deirdre and Larry sit at a nearby picnic table eating French
fast food which we get a good look at as we - PAN THE LENGTH
OF THE TABLE which is covered with pasta grilled sausages
with dijon mustard really good fried potatoes

In fact everything thats on this table is so far beyond the
imagination of your average American truck driver that Larry
cant contain himself Hes stuffing himself washing
everything down with the wine which is also sold at these
road-side rest stops Deirdre drinks coffee

LARRY
(mouth full)
Thisthis is incredible Is the rest
of Europe like this

DEIRDRE
(with a laugh)

Some places not all Italy for
instance theyre serious about their
food But try bloody Britain anywhere
in the UK you dont get much fancier
than a deep-fried bar egg Foods not
our thing you see

LARRY
What is

DEIRDRE
(everybody knows this)
Best beer in the world known to man or
God

LARRY
(with a snort)
Best beer in the world Budweiser for
me thanks

DEIRDRE
(with unconcealed scorn)
Budweiser You talk to me of beer and
youve the unbridled gall to mention
Budweiser in the same sentence Thats
not beer Christ its not even a poor
excuse for rabbit piss

LARRY
Oh yeah Whatta you drink then

DEIRDRE
I drink what every civilized man woman
and child in the world drinks Guinness

VINCENT (0S)
I hate to interrupt a conversation of
such cultural depth

CUT AWAY TO REVEAL Vincent -
Who has finished his phone call and returned to join them

VINCENT
but weve got to get back on the road

Vincent raps lightly on the car window next to Sams head --
Sams eyes shoot open a light sleeper All eyes are on
Vincent who waits for a BEAT before he reveals his news

VINCENT
Weve got him

LARRY
Im driving

EXT THE TOWN SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

Gregor is seated where we saw him last -- at the little table
in the corner cafe Hes been here for hours observing the
Town Square and now he finally sees what hes been looking
for - TWO MEN definitely not tourists here for the music
have entered the Square -- everything about these guys
screams GUNMEN Now as Gregor watches - A PUNKED-OUT TEEN
comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope The
Gunmen look around the Square trying to see where Gregor is
but hes too far back in the shadows The Gunmen ask the
Teen a question to which the Teen can only shrug his
shoulders Now - The Teen walks away leaving the Gunmen to
open the envelope and look at its contents which are quickly
read From OFF SCREEN we hear the sound of Gregor punching
in a number on his cell phone Simultaneously the Gunmen
finish reading the instructions Gregor has sent them and
turn around to face - A PAY PHONE The phone rings and one
of the Gunmen goes to pick it up

EXT ANOTHER STREET - MEANWHILE

The Citroen pulls into town and slows to a crawl cruising
the streets looking for Gregor

INT THE CITROEN - SAME TIME

Vincent stares out of the window and sees something that
causes him to swear under his breath in French Its -

The Gunmen walking down the street

VINCENT
I know those men

Sam frowns he also seems to recognize at least one of the
gunmen None of the others in the car notice Sams reaction
but we do The Gunmen are heading straight for -

EXT THE ANCIENT ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

THE MID-AFTERNOON SUN shines down on the open air Roman
Theater The theater itself is almost two thousand year

old A semi-circle of seats surrounds a huge Stage Wall a
massive structure which is one of the best preserved of its
kind in the world THE GUNMEN enter at the bottom of the
theater holding ticket stubs They are with a Tour Group
led by an ANCIENT GEEZER who speaks in rapid-fire French As
the tour moves off to see the Stage Wall the Gunmen hang
back and then separate from the crowd

EXT OUTSIDE THE THEATER - SAME TIME

THE CITROEN sits at a curb Larry sits behind the wheel of
the car the getaway driver with the motor running Vincent
and Deirdre are already walking towards the Theater Sam
stays behind for a second to say something to Larry

SAM
Whatever you hear whatever happens when
your partners come back out you make
sure youre here with the motor running

And on that note Sam follows after Vincent and Deirdre
Larry doesnt notice it but - THE WATCHER has found them
Hes a block or so away wearing a two-day stubble of beard
and hugging the shadows of back alley Cradled in one hand
barely visible but ominously present his knife which for
one moment catches a glint of sun that hits our eyes as we -

CUT TO
EXT INSIDE THE ROMAN THEATER - MEANWHILE

The Gunmen have reached a point about midway up the coliseum-
like staircase Behind them we can see the Tour Group
standing on the stage being lectured to by the Ancient
Geezer In front of them the Gunmen find -

AN EXIT which leads to an interior hall Inside the exit
its dark while a bright sun falls down on the Gunmen They
look into the dark unable to see a thing while a voice

come at them from out of the dark

GREGOR (VO)
Thank you gentleman that will do
nicely

IN THE HALL -

ON GREGOR Its dark in here There are no lights no
torches From the dark in here he can look out and see -
THE GUNMEN who make plain targets backlit as they are by
the sun Now we CUT BACK AND FORTH between these two ANGLES
and it becomes clear that Gregor has chosen wisely -- he can
see his quarry but they cant see him

GREGOR
Edvard is that you

EDVARD the more dangerous looking of the two Gunmen
responds

EDVARD
Yes Gregor they sent me

GREGOR
Im touched really that theyd send
someone of your caliber Its nice to
know that they didnt make the mistake of
underestimating me twice
EDVARD
That was a mistake trying to kill you
Mikhi did it without consulting me Id
have never allowed it

GREGOR
Im sure But Im sorry to say that its
too late for trust we have a serious
problem

EDVARD
Well double your price

GREGOR
(now thats interesting)
Really Do you have the money with you

EDVARD
Do you have the material

GREGOR
You first Edvard

EDVARD
Perhaps we could both go at the same
time

GREGOR

(a short laugh)
I think not

(with a flourish)
After you

A GUN COMES INTO FRAME trigger cocked the barrel placed to
Gregors temple

SAM (0S)
After you asshole

Gregor stiffens as we PULL BACK ON Sam who has snuck up on
Gregor and gotten the drop on him

SAM
You might have been one mean technical
spook Gregor but you wouldnt have
lasted a week in the field

CUT TO THE GUNMENS POV Looking into the Tunnel - Its dark
they cant see a thing but theyve heard Sams voice and
they know somethings wrong
EDVARD
Gregor are you alright

DEIRDRE (0S)
Gregors fine

CUT AWAY TO REVEAL Deirdre -
Shes snuck up on the Gunmen weapon drawn

DEIDRE
(continuing)
but I think youre in a bit of
trouble

The Gunmen reach for their pieces and as they do -

VINCENT (0S)
Dont even think it

CUT AWAY TO REVEAL Vincent - And his piece is also out --
the Gunmen are trapped and they know it Now we notice that
- The Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are coming towards
us Meanwhile back in -

THE TUNNEL -

Sam is grilling Gregor furiously his gun still to Gregors
head

SAM
Dont talk to me unless you tell me what
I want to hear understand You have
no choice in this dont think about
winning think about staying alive I
want the item and if you dont give it
to me Im gonna kill you

GREGOR
(a panicky hiss)
I dont have it with me

SAM
Bullshit

GREGOR
I swear

SAM

Then where is it

GREGOR
I sent it to myself in Paris

SAM
Sent it where

GREGOR
A post office box

Suddenly Gregor runs forward towards the exit Sam runs
after him tackling him just as they reach - THE OUTSIDE
where the two men roll into plain sight of - The Gunmen who
are still covered by Vincent and Deirdre Now we notice -
That the Ancient Geezer and his Tour Group are really close
no more than ten yards away as - Sam has Gregor pinned face
first on the ancient stone of the theater He looks up at
the others and thats when it happens - Edvard looks at Sam
and recognizes him

EDVARD
(stunned announcing to the
group)
Do you know who he is Hes with
Interpol the Internation Police Hes
a cop

A SLOW MOTION BEAT

Vincent and Deirdre dont know what to make of this their
heads turn to look at Sam and in this instant - The Tour
Group walks into their midst and - The 2nd Gunman reaches for
his piece and - Sam FIRES his gun at the 2nd Gunman and with
the sharp report of the pistol we move back to REAL TIME as -
The Crowd panics screaming and now Edvard is reaching for
his weapon as - Sam shoots again killing the 2nd Gunman

and now - The Crowd is still screaming and running as -

Gregor shoves through the crowd into the exit as -

Deirdre pushes through the crowd and now shes made it into
the tunnel Now we go -

OUTSIDE THE THEATER -

Where Larry has heard the shot -- his piece is drawn but
hes been ordered to stay in the car In frustration he
slams on the steering wheel as we see that - Behind Larry
the Watcher is slowly closing in knife poised to strike as
we go back -

INTO THE THEATER -

Edvard tries to get to the exit but there are too many
Tourists in his way and he proceeds to shoot several of
them including the Dad we saw earlier Seconds later
Edvard has vanished into the tunnels and now - Vincent and
Sam meet in the middle of the crowd There is time for a
QUICK BEAT while Vincent glares at Sam

VINCENT
Youre a copyoure a fucking copI
should kill you

SAM
But you cant

And now Sam runs into the tunnel after the others leaving
Vincent for a fraction of a second to sigh and then follow
Sam into -

THE TUNNELS -

Its like being in the tunnels and ramps of a sporting arena
Except that everything here is made of stone and the only
light comes from the sun which streams in through the exit
openings which are spaced far enough apart that they provide
just barely enough light for us to see Now we do a SERIES
OF QUICK CUTS - Sam running followed by - Vincent while -
Edvard takes a wrong turn down a dark hall and comes to a
dead end He turns around looking for a way out as - Gregor
sees the final exit ahead of him as we go -

OUT IN THE STREET - Larry is still behind the wheel of the
Citroen anxiously looking at the exit not realizing that -
The Watches is almost on him and now were back -

IN THE TUNNELS -

Deirdre comes running around a corner and now shes almost
reached the exit as -

OUT IN THE STREET -

Gregor hits the street running He doesnt notice the
Citroen parked ahead because hes never seen it before but
as he runs by -

The car door swings open and Gregor runs straight into it
He smashes into the door and falls to the ground injured
Strong Hands reach out of the car and pull him in Its the
Watcher and lets give him a name now because he needs one
SEAMUS REILLY Seated in the front seat is - A very dead
Larry Seamus has cut his throat from ear to ear

SEAMUS
(to Gregor with an Irish
accent)
If you want to live youll do exactly as
I tell you

THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW - Deirdre appears exiting the
theater and running towards the Citroen as we go back to -

INT THE TUNNELS - SAME TIME

Vincent gun drawn moves warily down one of the tunnels
Outside we can hear the dim sound of an approaching siren
Vincent turns a corner and - A GUN jams itself into his face
Its Edvard

EDVARD
Where do I know you from

VINCENT
Vienna
EDVARD
Of courseI remember I quite liked

you Im sorry to have to do this
Edvards finger tightens around the trigger when -

SAM (0S)
Hey

Edvard is startled by the sound of Sams voice Even as he
squeezes off the shot Edvard turns to look at Sam and as he
does so Vincent strikes out at the gun sending the shot
awry causing it to - RICOCHET wildly whining around the
room until it - Rips through Sams side a nasty wound but
not fatal as - Edvard tries to fire another shot but its
too late because - Vincent fires a single shot to the head
that kills Edvard

EXT OUTSIDE THE THEATER - MEANWHILE

Deirdre has reached the Citroen She looks in and sees
Seamus and Gregor Lastly she looks at the dead Larry She
sighs in disgust but otherwise doesnt react as if
surprised

DEIRDRE
Cold cocking the poor son-of-a-bitch
would have sufficed Seamus dont you
think

SCANT SECOND LATER -
Larrys body hits the street as the Citroen drives off
Deirdre behind the wheel just as - Sam and Vincent run out of
the theater with Vincent helping a wounded Sam who bleeds
from the wound in his side They arrive at the street only
to see - Larry lying dead in the street even as the Citroen
speeds away from them turning the corner before they can
even think to raise their guns

VINCENT
That double-crossing bitch

Sam isnt even capable of saying that much -- he just stares
after the departed Citroen with a look on his face unlike any
weve seen in the film how the hell did that happen But
theres no time to ponder this because theyve been joined by
- A COP Hes a local guy he directs traffic and busts
drunks in the town square -- and hes scared shitless

holding his gun in both hands trying not to tremble as he
stares back at - TWO GUNS Sams and Vincents and theyre
both pointed at the Cop LONG BEAT In the way off distance
another siren can just be heard Sam and Vincent glare at
the Cop who strains with all his might to control himself
but he cant because Sam and Vincent are death waiting to be
served The cop knows he has three seconds to make up his
mind Two One The Cop puts his gun on the ground and
steps back raising his hands in the air Now - Sam and
Vincent stumble into the street and are instantly almost hit
by - A CAR speeding around the corner its Driver oblivious
to whats going on The car screeches to a halt and the
Driver curses loudly in French And then the next thing the
Driver knows - A Gun is in his face The door is yanked open
and the Driver is yanked out as we -

CUT TO
EXT A BACK ROAD - LATEREARLY EVENING

The town of Orange is just visible below us as the
commandeered Car drives up into the hills Vincent is behind
the wheel while the wounded Sam sits in the passenger seat
Gritting his teeth Sam peels back his shirt to get a look at
- THE WOUND and its small but bad -- the ricochet ripped a
small raw hole in Sams side The wound bleeds but

moderately so -- no major organs or arteries have been hit
VINCENT
That makes twice now youve saved my
life
SAM

I didnt save your life back there
Risked it maybe -- but I didnt save
shit

VINCENT
You see it your way Ill see it mine
You need a doctor

SAM
(hopeful)
You know one around here Somebody you
trust

VINCENT
NoI thought Id take you to the
hospital

SAM
(sharply)
No hospitals Ill fix this myself if I
have to

VINCENT

(he cant believe this)
Fix it yourself

(a thought comes to him)
Why are we even doing this Theres no
need to run Christ

(he cant disguise his disgust)
Youre a cop

SAM
Not exactly

VINCENT
Youre with Interpol -- youre a cop

SAM
If I was a cop a real cop Id have
busted you a long time ago This isnt
about you its about the job I have to
do

VINCENT
And what job is that

SAM
My job Vincent a job you dont need to
know about I cant go to the local cops
-- theyd never be able to get close
enough at this point Its me or nobody
and Ive been on this job too goddamned
long not to finish
BEAT Sam takes out his own pack of cigarettes offers one
to Vincent and takes another for himself They smoke for a
second before Vincent speaks

VINCENT
It looks to me like were all thats left
of our group

SAM
We There is no we in my world now
Vincent just me

VINCENT
Im going with you

SAM
This doesnt involve you dont you
understand I cant even guarantee you
any money out of all this

VINCENT
It isnt about money for me not
anymore

SAM

You dont have to do this

VINCENT
(with great finality)
Yes I do

Sam gives Vincent a look and shakes his head in disbelief --
Vincents loyalty and sense of honor is something hes never
seen before and Sam can only smoke in silence and consider
this as we -

CUT TO
INT A CHEAP BACK ROOM - NIGHT
A PEEPHOLE slides open and we look through it into -
INT AN ADJOINING ROOM
where Gregor sits bound and gagged in a chair his eyes wide
with fright Now - The Peephole snicks shut and Deirdre
turns to face Seamus Reilly
DEIRDRE

When were done with this I want to do
for that one myself
SEAMUS
Now theres the Deirdre I know

DEIRDRE
And whats that supposed to mean Seamus
Reilly

SEAMUS

It means I was worried that all the time
you spent away from the fold might have
affected you Youve been living the
life of the hired gun -- the well paid
hired gun I might note Theres no
glory to it but there are those that
like it

DEIRDRE
So you thought that maybe Id grown too
attached to this charade Ive been
playing is that it

SEAMUS
Its been known to happen

DEIRDRE
Not to me you know that

SEAMUS
(goading her)
I thought I did

Seamuss taunt works Deirdre whips out her gun and puts it
to his head

DEIRDRE
I guess you dont know me then if you
think I wont kill you for an insult like
that

Seamus glares at Deirdre for a moment and she glares back at
him until he starts to laugh

SEAMUS
Just testing lass Forgive me but I
had to do it

Deirdre glares a moment more and then puts away her gun

DEIRDRE
Remember what we agreed on Seamus when
we get home I dont play the girl
again
Deirdre gives Seamus a look to make sure this last point is
clear and we -

CUT TO
EXT A FARMHOUSE - THE COUNTRY - NIGHT

The Stolen Car parks behind a BARN and Sam and Vincent get
out Waiting for them is a friend of Vincents - JEAN-
PIERRE a Frenchman in his forties hearty burly friendly

VINCENT
Hello Jean-Pierre

JEAN-PIERRE
Hello my friend
(with a look at Sam)
He doesnt look French to me Vincent

SAM
American

JEAN-PIERRE
Well Vincents American friend shall we
see what we can do for you

INT THE FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - LATERNIGHT

SURGICAL IMPLEMENTS - Are laid out on a clean cloth
Scalpel forceps a clamp a sponge medical thread and
needles We PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sam stretched out on the
kitchen table Around him we see - Vincent and Jean-Pierre
who are wearing rubber gloves and examining Sams wound
Jean-Pierre holds a mirror up so that Sam can see whats
going on Sam with his medical training is treating
himself

VINCENT
(to Sam)
Its right there beneath the surface I
can just make it out

Sam is in terrible pain but necessity dictates that he focus
on whats going on so that he can talk Vincent through this
next procedure

JEAN-PIERRE
Are you sure you wont have a drink

SAM
(sharply)
No boozePains in the mind and the
mind I can control

(quick beat)
Alright lets do it

During this next sequence we CUT BACK AND FORTH between
Sams reactions to the surgery and the mirror itself where
hes watching

SAM
Douse the wound with alcohol

Vincent pours a healthy splash of rubbing alcohol onto the
wound and - Sam grits his teeth as the pain explodes up his
central nervous system

SAM
(to Jean-Pierre)
Take that sponge and wipe away as much of
the blood as you can keep it clean so I
can see

Jean-Pierre does as Sam says wiping away the blood that
keeps filling the wound Throughout the procedure Jean-
Pierre will do this every time the sponge is saturated he
squeezes the excess blood into - A BUCKET which sits on the
floor slowly filling up with drippings from the sponge

SAM
(to Vincent)
Take the clamp

Vincent picks up the clamp

SAM
Peel back the skin and attach the clamp

Vincent attaches the clamp to Sams wound It takes perhaps
fifteen seconds and everyone of those seconds is agonizing
for Sam He sweats he grits his teeth he grunts the
smallest of grunts But he doesnt move Finally Vincent is
done

VINCENT
Alright its done

SAM
You see the bullet

VINCENT
Clearly
SAM
Good Now take the forceps and
remember Vincent what were doing here
is routine Ive done stuff like this at
least twenty times in the field There
are no vital organs where youre working
no major muscles or arteries -- you cant
kill me Just make sure youve got the
bullet before you try to pull it out

Vincent probes the wound with the forceps This takes
probably thirty seconds and it hurts even more then when the
clamp was attached

Several times - Vincent seems to have the bullet in his
grasp but it slips and each time it slips - Sam makes the
smallest of noises as if to indicate the level of the pain
Finally - The forceps firmly grasp the bullet and with a
single tug Vincent extracts it

VINCENT
(holding the bullet aloft)
A souvenir

He tosses the bullet through the air and we FOLLOW IT IN
SLOW MOTION as it lands in - A SAUCER which sits on the
kitchen counter Were back in REAL TIME as the bullet
rolls around the plate for a second before coming to a halt
Now - Sam breathes the hugest of sighs and his face relaxes
Instantly Vincent puts a lighted cigarette in Sams mouth
and he drags deeply on it

SAM
(to Vincent)
You think you can stitch me up on you
own

JEAN-PIERRE
Dont worry well take care of it

SAM
Then if you dont mind
(he hands the cigarette back to
Vincent)
Im gonna pass out

And thats exactly what he does
A TIME CUT TO

INT FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
Vincent and Jean-Pierre sit on easy chairs An open bottle
of wine sits between them a FIRE burns in the fireplace and
they smoke in a contented silence for a moment When they
speak it is in FRENCH with ENGLISH SUBTITLES

JEAN-PIERRE
Hes tough your American friend

VINCENT
Yes Sams tough alright

JEAN-PIERRE
And you respect him

VINCENT
Of course Dont you

JEAN-PIERRE
Ive never seen a man who could have
taken what he just went through
(beat)
Hes a cop

VINCENT
(beat trying to find a way to
say it)
Not exactly

JEAN-PIERRE
Not exactly But close enough eh
(beat)
So he saved your life then

VINCENT
How did you know

JEAN-PIERRE
If he hadnt youd have put a bullet in
his head a long time ago

Both men stare back into the fireplace and we HOLD FOR A BEAT
before we -

DISSOLVE TO
INT THE FARM - KITCHEN - DAWN

Sam is awake Pale from the loss of blood he moves softly
around the kitchen searching professionally for something
giving the moment a slightly dangerous feel because he seems
so intent on what hes doing and then he finds it - THE
COFFEE
TEN MINUTES LATER -

A stream of Hot Coffee migles with a stream of Steamed Milk
EXT THE FARMHOUSE PORCH - SUNRISE

A STEAMING CUT OF COFFEE sits in Sams hands as he lights a
cigarette to go with the coffee He sits on an ancient
chair smoking in silence looking out at - THE WOODS around
the house and this place is postcard-beautiful the French
Farmhouse you see only in pictures But Sams mind is
elsewhere hes staring into space lost in thought

JEAN-PIERRE (0S)
Youre feeling better

ANOTHER ANGLE - Jean-Pierre stands in the open front door of
the farmhouse with a cup of coffee Now Jean-Pierre moves
out to join Sam sitting down on another chair opposite him

SAM
(responding to the question)
Some thanks Enough to move on for

now
JEAN-PIERRE
(pointing at Sams wounded
side)
You should really let a doctor look at
that
SAM
Soon

JEAN-PIERRE
But first you have something to take care
of

SAM
Yeah

JEAN-PIERRE
Something important A thing that cannot
wait

SAM
It gets done now or not at all Another
couple of days and the parties concerned are
gone where I cant get them

JEAN-PIERRE
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs
but I am the one who connected Vincent to
this job his agent if you will He is
one of my oldest friends and I owe him a
great debt much like the debt I suspect
he owes you

A QUICK CUT TO
INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE

Where Vincent has just poured himself a cup of coffee and lit
a very satisfying cigarette when he hears the voices from
outside

SAM (0S)
Vincent doesnt owe me a thing

Vincent looks up when he hears his name and he moves towards
the sound of the voices

JEAN-PIERRE (0S)
He sees this differently as you well
know

SAM (0S)
I didnt expect that he would

BACK ON THE PORCH -

JEAN-PIERRE
You suffered through an agonizing pain
last night pain you could have avoided
by declaring yourself an agent of the
law

SAM
Vincent told you that Im a cop

JEAN-PIERRE
Not a word But no ordinary criminal
would have the extensive military and
medical expertise you do And so I place
the pieces of the puzzle together ina
way that makes sense to me You work for
some government agency and you carry a
gun and in my world that makes you a
cop

And now Jean-Pierre produces a LONG BARRELED REVOLVER which
he places loosely in his lap -- a gesture which seems to say
youd better explain things to my satifaction or were
gonna have a problem Sam notices the weapon but he
doesnt react overtly

SAM
So this is what a test

JEAN-PIERRE
Call it a reckoning of character

BEAT Sam looks at the Revolver again

SAM
If I was healthy I could take that away
from you

JEAN-PIERRE
Perhaps But you are not healthy and if
you try Ill kill you

QUICK CUT TO Vincent - Who stands inside the house out of
sight but not out of ear shot Hes listening to
everything and we notice that Vincent has taken out his
own gun

BACK ON Jean-Pierre and Sam By now Jean-Pierre has raised
the pistol He doesnt point it at Sam but his finger cocks
the hammer

SAM
So what is it you want to know

JEAN-PIERRE
I suppose I want to know how a man like
you is created

SAM
Created

JEAN-PIERRE
Perhaps forged is a better word Like
steel Like a sword Youre a modern
Samurai Ive spent my life around

extraordinary men -- men like Vincent
But Ive never seen anyone like you
(beat)
Im afraid Vincent will die if he goes
with you
SAM

Vincents life is his own burden hell
have to carry it for himself And Im
not any kind of Samurai
JEAN-PIERRE
You seem one to me

SAM
A Samurai has honor a Samurai live by
the code of Bushido the way of the
warrior Im just a killer for hire
(beat)
The world isnt about honor anymore
Its about survival

LONG BEAT Something in Sams speech touches Jean-Pierre
He relaxes his finger on the hammer

JEAN-PIERRE
Survival I suppose thats as good a
cause as any

BACK ON Vincent - Who relaxes his grip on his gun BACK ON
Sam and Jean-Pierre - And were PULLING BACK AWAY from the
Farmhouse which glows in the morning sun as we -

DISSOLVE TO
EXT A PARIS STREET - DAY

A BLACK COMPACT CAR sits in front of a Parisian Post Office
Inside the car behind the wheel we see Deirdre Now
coming out of the Post Office we see - Gregor and Seamus
Reilly Seamus has a coat slung over his arm hiding the gun
which he keeps pressed to Gregors side Theres no sign of
the Briefcase as Seamus and Gregor get into -

INT THE CAR - SAM TIME

THUNK The door slams shut Gregor and Seamus are in the
back seat Almost instantly Seamus angrily snaps a pair of
handcuffs on Gregor Immediately Deirdre pulls out

DEIRDRE
Wheres the case

GREGOR
(nervous)
Theres a problem

SEAMUS
(jumping all over him)
Problem my ass I think youre lying to
me and if you are youre a dead man
DEIRDRE
Would somebody tell me what fucking well
happened in there

SEAMUS
(disgusted)
Nothing
GREGOR

(eager to explain)
The package didnt come Im sure it
will tomorrow

Suddenly Seamus seems to lose it He grabs Gregor and slams
a gun against his head

SEAMUS
(hes almost foaming at the
mouth)
If youre lying to me you poor excuse for
a human being Im gonna blow your brains
all over this car

GREGOR
(beyond desperate)
I swear it has to come here It has
to

BEAT For one tension-filled moment we think Seamus is
going to splash Gregors brains all over the place But then
he smiles puts his weapon away and pats Gregor gently on
the face

SEAMUS
Ease up manIm just checking to make
sure youre on the level

Gregor is beyond speech -- he can only whimper

SEAMUS
And it seems to me I saw a sign in there
that says they got a late afternoon
delivery Why dont we come back later
today and do this all over again huh

Seamus smiles a smile that is more than a little bit
sadistic Neither Gregor nor Deirdre smiles in return as we -

cut To

EXT ANOTHER STREET - PARIS - DAY
THE EIFFEL TOWER fills our eyes And then we PULL BACK TO
REVEAL that its a tacky flyblown poster on a dingy street
And now were -

MOVING DOWN the Street until we come to a store whose sign
advertises in English - HONG KONG MOVIES The windows of the
store are filled with posters We MOVE THROUGH TO

INT THE STORE - SAME TIME

TONY SIMON an expatriate black American runs this place and
lives above it His shelves are lined with action films made
in the Far East Tony knows everything there is to know
about the films he sells -- but he also knows quite a bit
about whats going on in the Parisian Underworld hes a
professional information broker Right now hes talking to a
CUSTOMER in perfect French with English Subtitles

TONY
Hey man theyre both great movies One
is more of a character study the other
is more of a straight action thing but
theyre great movies and hes an amazing
fucking filmmaker

Tony looks up and sees something that catches his attention

TONY
Excuse me

Vincent and Sam have entered the store Sams ability to be
back on his feet in such a short time is amazing -- but we
can see that hes not the same guy he was at the start of the
film what he does from here on in he does by sheer force of
will Now - Tony moves to join them and the conversation
immediately turns to English

TONY
(to Vincent)
My man how you doing

VINCENT
Im alright And you

TONY
Doing well
(with a look at Sam)
This is
VINCENT

A friend I was telling him about how
you always have the latest tapes
TONY
Why dont we step into my office

Tonys office it turns out is the area behind the COUNTER
Tony raises a section of the counter that allows him to get
to the other side and then he closes it behind him

TONY
So what can I do for you

Vincent checks out the store before he starts speaking The

place is empty except for - The single Customer Tony was just
talking to The Customer is still considering the two films

Tony was showing him

VINCENT
I was wondering if you had any movies
that were particularly new

TONY
Matter of face theres this flick Ive
been hearing about I havent seen it

but from what I hear its pretty cool

SAM
Whats the story

TONY
Its an international thing Several
different peoples involved criminals
from all over the world experts brought
together to do a job But maybe the most
interesting thing about it is that
preeminent in the plot we find the
Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together
An unlikely group of partners

VINCENT
Do you have the tape

TONY
I might know where you could get a copy

The Customer approaches the counter He has both tapes with
him

TONY
(to Vincent and Sam)
Let me do some business with my boy here
and Ill meet you across the street in
five I gotta make homes here feel like
hes getting a good deal while I give him
the pleasure of overpaying me for a
couple of second generation pirates

EXT THE STREET OUTSIDE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The Customer exits smiling and carrying his tapes -- what
great fucking deal he just got A few seconds later Tony
comes out and locks up the store front He crosses the
street towards -

INT A FALAFEL JOINT - A FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT

A HUGE FALAFEL drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end
We PULL BACK ON - Tony whos just taken a bite out of the
falafel He sits at a table in the back with Vincent and
Sam

TONY
(his mouth full)
What Ive heard so far its all a lot of
talk I wasnt so sure what to make of
it at first cause like I said the
Irish and the Russians are an unlikely
mix

VINCENT
You said you might know where we can get
a copy of this tape

TONY
All depends on whether you want the
Russian or the Gaelic language version

SAM
(instantly)
Gaelic
TONY
You sure
SAM
Im sure
VINCENT
(to Tony)

Can you get it

TONY
The Russian would be easier

SAM
Whys that

TONY
Cause the Russian production company
would be easier to find

SAM
Its the Irish tape we want

TONY
(with a sigh)
Gonna be tough

Tony scribbles something on a piece of paper

TONY
Last I heard there was a film rep for the
Irish players staying at this address
name of Seamus Reilly

SAM
(repeating it he knows this
name)
Seamus Reilly

VINCENT
(to Sam)
You know him

SAM
I know of him

TONY
Seamus Reilly boys a serious Irish
Auteur -- a real firebrand Thinks his

more moderate filmmaking brethren have
turned to making movies for peace-loving
pussies if you see what Im saying

VINCENT
I get the picture

Sam reaches for the piece of paper but Vincent puts his hand
on top of it

VINCENT
Tony and I have to talk some business
first

TONY

I gotta try and overcharge him he has to
moan about the price we settle somewhere
in the middle

VINCENT
Its a matter of respect
(to Sam)
Why dont you wait outside this wont

take long
Sam smiles slightly and rises from the table moving towards
the exit Behind him in rapid-fire French Tony and Vincent
are now discussing the price of the information They are
both loud and abusive and obviously theyre enjoying
themselves immensely
EXT THE FALAFEL SHOP - A LITTLE LATER - DAY
Vincent exits the shop and gets into -

INT THE PEUGEOT

Where Sam sits in the passenger seat as Vincent slides behind
the wheel Vincent tosses Sam a piece of paper

SAM
The Irish representative

VINCENT
Yes

Vincent gives Sam another piece of paper

SAM
Whats this

VINCENT
The address of the Russian production
company Just in case we need to find
them

SAM
Thorough man

Vincent starts the car and we -
CUT TO
EXT A PARIS STREET - LATER - AFTERNOON

The Peugeot sits parked at a cub a discreet distance from -
AN APARTMENT HOUSE 35 Rue de Glacon We PUSH IN on the -

INT THE PEUGEOT - LATE AFTERNOON
A PIECE OF PAPER scarwled with the same address 35 de
Glacon We PULL BACK TO REVEAL -

Sam holding this paper and looking out at the apartment
complex

SAM
You sure your friend got the right place

VINCENT
If Tony says this is it then its it

BEAT Vincent wants to know something important

VINCENT
Tell me Sam why do you do this

SAM
Do what

VINCENT
Continue when it would be so much easier
to give it up

SAM
Its my job

VINCENT
Then quit
(beat)
You dont work for Interpol Sam

SAM
Sure I do You heard him you heard the
guy -- thats what he said what Edvard
said

VINCENT

Its a cover then A cover within a
cover a feint within a feint

(quick beat)
You work for the CIA its the only
possible answer

LONG BEAT Sam considers what to say and then decides he
owes Vincent the truth

SAM
Im a field agent -- last of an already
extinct breed I do dark ops
VINCENT
Dark ops

SAM
Dark operations Wet work Kidnaping
Assassination

VINCENT
Very ugly

SAM
It is at that

VINCENT
Not very zen of you huh Not so much
the modern Samurai after all

SAM
I never made that claim

VINCENT
I know Jean-Pierre did

SAM
You were behind the door

VINCENT
I was waiting to see what would happen
I didnt want to kill him if I didnt
have to

SAM
You would have done that

VINCENT
I would have tried not to But yes if
it would have kept him from shooting you
I would have

SAM
(almost to himself)
How could you have done that

VINCENT
Because I owe you
(he sees something)
Look at that

THEIR POV Through the Windsheild - Deirdre exits the
apartment building

SAM (0S)
(quietly exultant)
All things come to those who wait

Now Deirdre is followed by Seamus and Gregor

VINCENT (0S)
(really surprised by this)
Hes not dead

BACK ON Sam and Vincent

SAM
(figuring it out)
They dont have the package

VINCENT
You think

SAM
You said it yourself Gregors not dead
If they had the package theyd have

killed him
Vincent and Sam exchange a look -- now they both figure it
out
VINCENT and SAM
(simultaneously)
Theyre going to get it
CUT TO

INT THE POST OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

A HAND signs a receipt and we PULL BACK TO REVEAL Gregor at
a counter signing for his package which slides across the
counter Its the Briefcase although its been wrapped in
BROWN PAPER for its journey through the French Postal System
Now we see that - Seamus is still right beside Gregor is in
face almost on top of him with a hand in his coat pocket
which lets us know where his gun is Now - The two men start
to move towards the exit as we -

CUT TO
EXT THE STREET OUTSIDE - A MINUTE LATERLATE AFTERNOON

The Black Compact Car idles at a nearby curb with Deirdre
behind the wheel Shes staring so intently at the front of
the post office that shes surprised when a SHADOW falls
across her She looks up to see - Sam standing next to the
car Deirdre starts to reach for her weapon but Sam cuts
her off with a word

Something
backs off

SAM
Dont do it

in his voice conveys enough of a threat that she
Now she and Sam exchange a long look

DEIRDRE
Well if it isnt Mr Interpol himself
(she really sounds betrayed)
I cant believe I misjudged you like I
did

SAM
Oh pleaseyoure on some sort of holy
mission

DEIRDRE
Im a patriate

SAM
Dont even think that Im buying that
ying

DEIRDRE
Where do you get off saying word one
All the time pretending to be one of us
its the same thing we were doing Seamus
and myself And here you are so high and
mighty like youre so different from the
rest of us

SAM
I didnt say I was

DEIRDRE
(she sees something)
Bloody fucking hell

CUT AWAY TO Gregor and Seamus are leaving the post office
By now Seamus has taken the package away from Gregor

Unseen by

these two men - Vincent is approaching from the

side on an intercept course his hand inside a bag which he
carries with him Now - Deirdre turns and shoots Sam a look
Hes still watching her keenly and we can see that shes

aching to

reach for her piece but she cant because Sam is

still on her like a hawk

SAM
Dont even think it

He pulls back the folds of his suit jacket revealing his
gun putting his hand comfortably on the pistol grip

SAM
Id kill you before you had it halfway
out

Vincent is closing on Gregor and Seamus another ten seconds
and hell have them

Now - Deirdre looks back at Sam then back at the situation
developing in front of her and then suddenly - She slams the
car into gear and drives off tires squealing while - Sam
pulls his piece sighting down the barrel and - He cant do
it cant shoot Deirdre Now - The sound of the car alerts
Seamus who turns in time to see - Vincent who is raising
the bag wrapped around his hand as - The car flies directly
at - Vincent who if forced to jump out of the way even as he
pulls the trigger of the gun hidden within the bag The end
of the bag explodes in a burst of fire but the shots are off
the mark - Missing Seamus and Gregor as - Vincent rolls out
of the way just in time while - Deirdre brakes the car to a
screaming halt as Seamus pushes Gregor in ahead of him and
then gets in Seconds later the car pulls out even as -
Sam drives up in the Peugeot to Vincent who picks himself up
off the ground and leaps into the car The last thing we
hear is the sound of Sams Voice as the Peugeot drives off

SAM (VO)
Put your seatbelt on

CUT TO
INT EXT - CAR CHASE MONTAGE

During this SEQUENCE well JUMP CUT BETWEEN the two cars and
the streets they travel through Now - The Black Compact Car
flies down a small street followed closely by - The Peugeot
where Sam is driving as Vincent tries to steady his gun to
get a clear shot at the other Car

INSIDE THE PEUGEOT -

VINCENT
What the fuck happened

SAM
I dont know

VINCENT
You dont know Bullshit you had her
there was no way out
IN THE COMPACT CAR -

Where Deirdre is driving for dear life while Seamus is
freaking out

SEAMUS
What in bloody hell is going on

DEIRDRE
Theyre part of the team One of thems
the guy I told you about

SEAMUS
From Interpol

DEIRDRE
Thats him

IN THE PEUGEOT -

VINCENT
Why didnt you kill her

IN THE COMPACT -

SEAMUS
Why didnt you kill him

OUT IN THE STREET -

The two cars SLAM through the traffic heading for a HIGHWAY
RAMP which appears now perhaps two blocks away

IN THE PEUGEOT -

VINCENT
(figuring it out)
You slept with her

IN THE COMPACT -

SEAMUS
How is it these fellahs managed to get
the drop on us

DEIRDRE
I told you theyre good

OUT IN THE STREET -

THE TWO CARS have reached the highway ramp and as first one
and then the other pulls onto the highway we PULL BACK AND
UP TO REVEAL
THE PERIFERIQUE -

The massive and confusing highway system which encircles the
city of Paris Right away we notice that this entrance ramp
leads to a traffic circle filled with various off ramps
which lead to no less than four different sections of the
Periferique

IN THE PEUGEOT -

VINCENT
(slamming the dashboard in
disgust)
You slept with her

IN THE COMPACT -

SEAMUS
(lecturing Deridre)
You should have kill him when you had
the chance But no

IN THE PEUGEOT -

VINCENT
You put everything on the line because
you
IN THE COMPACT
SEAMUS
(as if finishing Vincents
sentence)

You slept with the fucker
ON THE PERIFERIQUE -
THE PEUGEOT cruising on an upper part of the traffic circle
while down below them - THE COMPACT turns towards one of the

roadways

VINCENT (0S)
Fuck

IN THE PEUGEOT -

VINCENT
Left left left

Sam looks up and sees - Three possible ramps one to the
right one to the center and one to the - Left At the last
second he takes the left turn as we go back to -

IN THE COMPACT CAR -

Where Seamus has turned from lecturing Deirdre to threatening
Gregor Seamus holds the package in one hand and his gun in
the other

SEAMUS
(waving the package)
This better be the real thing or youre a
dead man

GREGOR
It is Im telling you it is

SEAMUS
Youve told me a lot of things boyo

ZING-SHATTER A BULLET blows a hole in their back windshield
as - The Peugeot is catching up and Vincent is leaning out
of his window firing away Now - Seamus turns to Deirdre

SEAMUS
Lose them

DEIRDRE
You lose them

Deirdre swings the wheel wildly and the Compact takes a
screaming turn followed by - The Peugeot and now theyre
both speeding towards another junction where several other
roadways of the Periferique run together Now we see that -
Seamus is returning Vincents fire even as - The Junction
approaches and now - Seamus screams at Deirdre

SEAMUS
To the right

Deirdre swerves to the right only to discover that shes now
on an -

EXIT RAMP going against heavy traffic Now -

Deirdre swerves her car around side-swiping several cars
but avoiding a major crash while - The Peugeot follows along
and now -

One of the cars that Deirdre side-swiped careens wildly down
the ramp crashing into - The Peugeot which grinds to a halt
as Vincent and Sam bounce forward in their seats restrained
by their seatbelts The car has stalled and Sam has to
start her up again and slam it into gear before following
after - The Compact which now has a lead of perhaps fifty
yards -- but at least its possible for the Peugeot to follow
after the Compact because its the only car on the highway
ahead of them thats GOING THE WRONG WAY and now we - PULL
BACK LOOKING DOWN FROM ABOVE and the two cars are flying
through the rush-hour traffic going the wrong way and now -
The Peugeot is gaining ground as Sam turns to Vincent

SAM
Give me a cigarette

VINCENT
Right now

SAM
Gimme a goddamn cigarette

VINCENT
(fumbling with a cigarette)
Why are you driving
(rapid fire)
Youre not French you dont live here
you dont know these roads Why are you
driving

He puts the cigarette in Sams mouth and as he does - The
Peugeot weaves in and out of the traffic gaining ground on
the Compact and now - SCREEEEECCHHH About fifteen cars
pile up crashing into one another and yet somehow - The
Compact Car emerges from the pile up unscathed and Seamus
breathes a hugh sigh of relief

SEAMUS
About time

DEIRDRE
(glancing in her mirror)
Not yet

The Peugeot has also managed to avoid the pile-up and its
back on their tail

SEAMUS
(practically tearing his hair)
Good Christ Cant you lose these
jokers

DEIRDRE
(through clenched teeth)
Theyre good
And now the Peugeot SLAMS into the side of the Compact Car
and as it does - Seamus opens fire with his gun even as -
Vincent unloads the better part of a clip as - Glass shatters
in both cars and now Deirdre looks up to see -

A FORK IN THE ROAD and the left side of the fork is closed
off blocked by - A SERIOUS CONCRETE BARRICADE and the
Compact Car is headed right for it and now -

Sam has the Peugeot pinned right to the side of the Compact
Car metal against metal a scream of steel as the Barricade
rushes straight at them and at the last second - Deirdre
slams on the brakes as -

Seamus fires one last shot that - blows out the window in
front of Sams eyes causing Sam to - Jerk the wheel of the
Peugeot wildly spinning out of control onto the exit ramp as
Gregor reaches over and unbuckles Seamuss seatbelt right as -
The Compact Car slams into the Barricade and CRASHES and
were in SLOW MOTION as -

Deirdre is driven forward by the force of the impact but
theres a drivers side air bag and it explodes cushioning
her even as —-

Seamus is hurled form the car crashing through the
windshield and flying through the air as -

The Compact Car flips over and over and over while -

Gregor who is wearing his seatbelt hangs on for dear life
to the Briefcase which he grabbed back from Seamus before
the crash and now -—

Seamus hits the ground with a terrible thud his face
sliced to ribbons by the windshield but somehow still alive
as -

Sam tries to control the Peugeot which is in a spin on the
exit ramp as -

Gregor kicks open the back door and slides out of the Car
carrying the Briefcase with him as -

Deirdre struggles to free herself from the wreck which is
now - On fire and now -

Sam has managed to stop the Peugeot but its too late to go
back because -

A VERITABLE FLEET OF COP CARS is now closing on the accident
and its too late to turn around and even as -

Deirdre manages to pull herself out of the wreck it -
EXPLODES into a ball of fire and the blast wave of fire -
Hits Seamus knocking him down covering him for a second
even as - Deirdre hurls herself through the flames and comes
out - Rolling away with Seamus who is now not only cut to
pieces but his face is covered with some hideous burns

Now Deirdre pulls Seamus over the side of the embankment
right before the cops arrive and the two of them rollfall
almost thirty down a steep incline even as -

Sam catches a quick glimpse of -

Gregor scurrying away from the highway carrying the
Briefcase and now Sam has to gun his car and get gone
because the Cops have reached -

The Wreck which is quickly burning itself out and as the
Cops look into the debris they see that -

THERES NOBODY LEFT Everybodys gone
FADE OUT

VINCENT (VO)
We dont have much time

FADE IN ON
INT VINCENTS APARTMENT - NIGHT

A FRONT DOOR guarded by about five heavy locks opens and
Vincent and Sam enter Sam looks around and surveys the
apartment

SAM
Nice place

ANOTHER ANGLE - And we see the rest of the apartment theres
practically nothing here A table with a couple of chairs a
fridge An open door leads to a bedroom with a small spare
bed and a nightstand with a cheap lamp

VINCENT
(by way of explaining)
Im not here very much

SAM
Business keeps you on the road
VINCENT
Something like that

The two men crass the room towards - A METAL CABINET which is
tucked into a nook in the wall - VINCENTS HAND turns a heavy-
duty COMBINATION LOCK and then Click the cabinet opens and
we see -- WEAPONS An endless cache of guns knives
explosives surveillance devices gun scopes -- you name it
its here Now Vincents Hands reach into the cabinet and
start taking out weapons We PULL BACK ON -

Vincent who gives the weapons to Sam Sam checks to make
sure the weapons are loaded andor ready for use and then
piles them one on top of the other

SAM
I know I dont need to say this to you
but I need to say it to you
(beat)
This is my job I have to do it

VINCENT
So I do it

SAM
No you dont and you know it

VINCENT
If our positions were reversed would you
leave me

SAM
(he says this too quickly)
In a minute

VINCENT
I think not

BEAT Sam cant say anything because he knows that what
Vincent is saying is true

VINCENT
(considering the weapons)
Do we need anything else

SAM
Yeah We need out fucking heads examined

Vincent thinks about this for a seoncd -- and then burst out
laughing as we -

cut To
INT ANOTHER CAR - MEANWHILENIGHT

Deirdre once behind the wheel The passenger seat next to
her is empty but as she drives we can see her eyes as they
flick from the road in front of her to the rearview mirror
which reveals -

A glimpse of the HIDEOUS FACE of Seamus Reilly Crashing
through the windshield and the blast of fire have forever
changed the way he looks his face is now a mass of oozing
wounds and burn tissue In his eyes we see the light of a
sick twisted man whos gone over the edge

DEIRDRE
You better be careful Seamus before
something happens a plastic surgeon cant
fix

SEAMUS

(a hideous laugh)
Plastic fucking surgeon

(indicates his face)
You think Im going to fix this Deirdre
lass Its the mark of the patriot and
Ill wear it like a badge As for those
who done it to me Ill take my pound of
flesh before this is all over

DEIRDRE
Youre thinking with your gun Seamus
and not your head

SEAMUS
(losing it)
Shut up
(he puts a gun to her head)
Shut up and drive Im your superior
officer and you will do as I goddamn well
say is that understood

BEAT Deirdre bristles at Seamuss words but says nothing

SEAMUS
Do I need to repeat myself

DEIRDRE
No Seamus I heard you the first time

EXT OUTSIDE THE CAR - SAME TIME

THE CAR zooms off into the night and as it does -
A LIGHT RAIN starts to fall and we -
DISSOLVE TO
EXT A CHATEAU OUTSIDE OF PARIS - NIGHT

THE SAME RAIN falls more of a steady mist than a rain The
mist GLEAMS electrically in the THOUSAND WATT LIGHTS which
shine from - THE CHATEAU Hundreds of years old it sits far
back from its own MAIN GATE In front of the Chateau - ARMED
MEN Lots of them Whatever this place is its not one
that invites company Now were - MOVING TOWARDS the
Chateau and as we MOVE we get a glimpse of the surrounding
environment ancient statues sitting benches in private
gardens small pools of fish -- you name it this place has
it We hear VOICES and theyre talking in - RUSSIAN

Heavy thick Russian punctuated with words like Da and
Nyet -- making it clear that weve reached the address of
the Russian Production Company BEHIND THE CHATEAU - MORE
GARDENS more everything Its well-patrolled but there
arent quite as many guards back here as there are out front
because bordering the chateau is a natural fotress -

A WOODS -

A forest really Filled with ancient trees almost mythic
in appearance and for all the light of the chateau this
place is darkness visible -- light comes here and dies And
in this woods looking out we find - Vincent and Sam
Heavily armed theyve just humped God knows how many miles
through the woods to get here Both men exhausted from the
walk -- Sam from his wound Vincent from his smoking habit
They collapse and Vincent takes out his cigarettes Even
though theyre screened from the chateau back here Sam
reaches over and takes the cigarettes out of Vincents hands

SAM
Not here They might see it

VINCENT

If Im going to die for the CIA Im
going to go out smoking

(takes the cigarettes back and

lights one)
Besides theres half a forest between us
and them they cant see a goddamned
thing

Vincent offers one to Sam who declines with a shake of
his head
SAM
Time to quit

VINCENT
Just like that

SAM
Not just like that Just before I turn
around and its six months from now and
the first thing I do when I wake up in
the morning is light a cigarette

VINCENT
(obviously he does this)
What of it
(almost to himself)
Samurai pain in the ass

SAM
(he hates this)
Would you stop with that

VINCENT

Why Youve got more force of will than
anyone Ive ever seen You handle a gun
like its a part of you you perform
surgery on yourself without anesthesia

(quick beat)
And most amazing of all you quit
smoking just like that

SAM

(qith a cynical laugh)
The mark of a true Samurai

(seriously)
What I do for the Company Vincent is no
different than what you do Were both
hired guns and this is a job -- like any
other job

VINCENT
Why then Sam dont you act like this is
a job like any other Surely if you are
a hired gun you realize that some times
you just have to walk away without
getting what you came for

SAM
Because I dont walk away

VINCENT
Why not
SAM
Its the one thing Ive got left to hold
onto
(beat)
Jean-Pierre is one of your closest
friends is he not

VINCENT
Closest and oldest

SAM
And yet you would have killed him to save
my life
(quick beat)

You have a sense of honor Vincent that
I cant even remember anymore I dont
know that I ever even had it to begin
with All I know to do Vincent is to
finish my job

VINCENT
And when you finish What then This
package whatever it is do you give it
to the CIA Do you really think they
deserve it

SAM
Thats a good question

VINCENT
Do you have a good answer

SAM
(hes really just considering
this)
No I dont

INT THE CHATEAU - MEANWHILE

ARMED RUSSIAN MOBSTERS everywhere -- a convention of the goon
squad

MOVING THROUGH the Chateau itself and from in here we see
the side of France we havent yet seen in this film culture
Each room could be a museum as we move through -

A GALLERY filled with paintings by Renaissance Masters -

A PARLOR with antique furniture the youngest piece of which
is two hundred years old -
A BALLROOM empty and barren but lit by the dazzling light
of an exquisite chandelier -

A KITCHEN where a cigarette smoking CHEF is putting the
finishing touches on what is perhaps the most amazing meal
youve ever seen Now - A SERVANT takes the tray and carries
it out to -

A DINING ROOM and the table is set for a formal dinner for
twenty with crystal and china at every place setting and
yet the table is occupied by only one man -

MIKHAEL RACHEV Russian Gangster Supreme called Mikhi Now -

The Servant sets the food down in front of Mikhi and as this
chief hood starts to eat a lonely and solitary dinner we PULL
BACK MOVING DOWN the length of the way-too-long table

EXT THE CHATEAU WALLS - NIGHT

A TAXI pulls up to the Main Gate and Gregor gets out
Attached to his wrist by that same handcuff the Briefcase
Gregor is admitted by a Guard as we -

CUT TO
INT THE DINING ROOMCHATEAU - A LITTLE LATER

Mikhi the Gangster is eating his dinner as Gregor is ushered
into the room THREE THUGS hang back behind Gregor watching
to see what Mikhi wants Now -

Mikhi waves the Thugs out of the room leaving Gregor alone
with the gangster Mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as
he motions for Gregor to sit

MIKHI
(in Russian English subtitles)
Sit sit
(offering a cigarette)
Would you like one

GREGOR

(in English)
No Mikhi I wouldnt

(letting that sink in for a

minute)
Since I wont speak your language and
you cant speak mine English will do
nicely

MIKHI
(makes no never mind to him)
Whatever you wish

(lights his own cigarette)
This has all been a terrible mistake
Gregor I wanted to play straight with
you but Edvard insisted we try and kill
you

GREGOR
Edvard said the same thing about you
before he died

MIKHI
Im shocked shocked to think that youd
believe him

GREGOR
(suddenly sharp)
Enough

Gregor raises the Briefcase which is still attached to his
wrist via the handcuff Gregor rests the Briefcase on the
table

MIKHI
Ahh

The moment of truth Before this scene can develop any
further a VOICE comes from Off Screen and as the Voice
speaks Gregor blanches

SEAMUS (0S)
The moment of truth is it

ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre and Seamus have entered the room
And we notice something unusual nobody is alarmed (except
for Gregor that is) Its as if they were expected

GREGOR
What is he doing here

As Seamus speaks he walks through the room examining the
valuable china and crystal all the while moving inexorably
closer to Gregor His face is if anything even more
horrific than it was a short while ago as his formerly fresh
wounds have started to scab over

SEAMUS
What am I doing here Why Im here to
see my partners Gregor the boys in the
Russian Mafia See your bosses had
hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull
your thieving double cross But they
only just found out that whats in the
briefcase is completely useless without
me I cant fight them and they cant
kill me -- that means were gonna have to
do business together

GREGOR
But you hate each other

SEAMUS
Whats a little hate between business
partners

EXT THE WOODS - MEANWHILE

Vincents CIGARETTE is stubbed into a rock and the two men
rise with a slow purpose They exchange a look and then Sam
steps forward leading the way

SAM
Im on point Vincent

A WIDE ANGLE - THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

Pure Kurosawa The JAPANESE DRUM weve heard before starts
to play again as -

THE LONG SHADOWS of Sam and Vincent come out of the woods and
into the brilliant light of the back lawn For one minute
they stand still and among the many weapons that Sam carries
is a long automatic rifle strung over his back and in the
SILHOUETTE for one minute it looks like a Samurai sword Now
the two men start to move across the lawn hugging the
shadows of the various statues and hedges trying to keep
from being discovered for as long as possible

BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

GREGOR
(to Seamus)
So youve got it all figured do you

SEAMUS
Figured enough to know theres an odd man
out and Im looking at him

GREGOR
I think not
(holds up the Briefcase)
I have of course taken the precaution
of wiring the briefcase to explode five
seconds after it opens Unless of
course I deactivate it before it goes
off

DEIRDRE
(under her breath)
That fucking figures

GREGOR
Should any of you decide to rush me Ill
kill myself and whoever happens to be
near me at the time

MIKHI
And more importantly --

GREGOR
Ill destroy whatevers in the case

BEAT Nobody moves Nobody speaks Until finally -

SEAMUS
It looks Gentlemen as if were gonna
have to sit down to table and work out an
agreement

Before this entirely too-weird scenario can play itself we go
back to -

THE BACK LAWN OF THE CHATEAU -

Sam and Vincent are closer to the Chateau moving in stealth
avoiding any entanglements and then Sam turns a corner and
comes face to face with - A GUARD and his gun is aimed at
Sams head Sams a dead man as we go —

BACK TO THE DINING ROOM

AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE splits the night and everyone in the
room looks at one another before Mikhi speaks

MIKHI
What was that

BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

The Guard who had Sam in his sights falls down dead shot by
- Vincent whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms
Vincent smiles at Sam

VINCENT
Thats one less I owe you
Sam smiles but its no time to get satisfied their
presence revealed theres no point in moving quietly Sam
draws his weapons and as he and Vincent charge across the
lawn towards the Chateau while -

BACK IN THE DINING ROOM -

MORE GUNSHOTS from outside -- not a war but enough to cause
serious alarm Deirdre ever the soldier draws her two
automatic pistols

DEIRDRE
(to Seamus and Mikhi)
You two stay here and watch our mutual
interest

She nods at Gregor and his Briefcase indicating what this
mutual interest is Then she turns and bolts the room and
as she does were -

BACK OUTSIDE THE CHATEAU -

Sam and Vincent are running along hugging the ground and
whatever darkness they can find while blind weapons fire
rips into the ground around them Russian thugs not even sure
what theyre shooting at but shooting all the same as Sam
and Vincent hurtle towards -

A BACK ENTRANCE TO THE CHATEAU -

Some kind of kitchen storage area and as Sam and Vincent
burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in
from an interior entrance and this is it Sam and Vincent
are outnumbered outgunned theyre going to die and then -
They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol
in his left hand and a submachine gun in his right and when
he fires he does so in short controlled bursts firing only
when he has the target in his sights while - Vincent fights
with a kind of sheer force a shotgun in one hand an Uzi in
the other he fires at anything and everything that moves
and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is
quiet Everybodys dead except for Sam and Vincent They
drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they
move towards - THE DOOR - It leads to two passages each one
leading to a separate wing of the chateau

SAM
Lets work our way through the building
Ill take one wing you take the other

Vincent and Sam split up moving into separate WINGS of the
Chateau and as they move off Sam speaks a word of warning

SAM
Watch your back Vincent

And then theyre gone and were with -

Deirdre whos running through the house going from room to
room and were with her for a minute the JAPANESE DRUM
starts to play again and now its joined by more and more
drums and they continue for the test of this sequence and
suddenly - A HUGE BURST OF GUNFIRE is heard dragging
Deirdres attention towards -

THE BALLROOM -

And Sams in the middle of a pitched battle with three
Gunmen He kills the first and then the second and then -
No third The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam
fires the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide
ripping into mirrors and chandeliers littering the floor
with glass And now were -

ON DEIRDRE -

Running through the halls as we hear one last burst of
gunfire somebody in the ballroom is dead Deirdre has
almost reached the ballroom when - Sam comes flying out and
the two of them CRASH TOGETHER sending the two of them
sprawling into - The shot-up mess that used to be the
Ballroom - And as they crash to the ground Sam loses his
weapon in the fall but Deirdre manages to hold onto one of
her two guns Now the two of them roll to their feet and as
they do were back in -

THE DINING ROOM -

Seamus the Madman is pacing the floor his face even worse
than before with each minute the mask of flesh that is now
his face is becoming more grotesque Little pustules have
started to form all over its surface oozing a whitish
viscous liquid A NEW BURST OF FIGHTING SOUNDS can be heard
and Seamus who is no longer capable of thinking straight
loses it

SEAMUS
I cant take it anymore
(to Mikhi)
Watch him man Im going out and finish
what needs finishing

And Seamus is gone and so are we -- back to -
THE BALLROOM -

Where Deirdre has her two guns pointed at Sam and - Does nothing
BEAT

SAM
Go on them

But Deirdre cant do it Theres something between these
two and now - Sam looks around and sees Deirdres other
pistol lying on a broken chair and now he -

Kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg causing it to
function as a lever sending the gun - THROUGH THE AIR ina
graceful SLOW-MO arc until it - THWACKS into Sams Hand Now
hes armed and he looks back at - Deirdre Her FINGER
tightens on the trigger shes almost ready to shoot -- if
Sam raises his piece hes a dead man

DEIRDRE
Let it go Sam walk away

In response Sam stares at Deirdre for a BEAT and then he
smiles an enigmatic smile and - He steps sideways into a
nearby corridor vanishing

DEIRDRE
God damn it

She runs after him but shes too late -- The corridor outside
is empty Now were back in -

THE DINING ROOM -

With Gregor and Mikhi and the tension is unbearable because
they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and
then stops but they dont have the least idea of whats
going on Still Mikhi wont let Gregor leave without giving
up the Briefcase Mikhi has a gun on Gregor who in turn
holds the Briefcase close ready to open it and set off the 5
Second Timer that will blow it up

GREGOR
(a feral hiss)
Well die if we stay here

MIKHI
(threatening with the gun)

Youll die if you leave here

Gregor sits back down fairly close to Mikhi Then ina
manner so deft that Mikhi never even notices Gregor extracts
a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the
Briefcase Before Mikhi can even react Gregor stabs his arm
forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhis
throat Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade
already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the
slashed artery Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground
jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up
the pistol and runs to leave the room and as he does we move
to -

THE GALLERY -

Filled with Paintings and Sculptures nothing less than 200
years old This place is a maze what with its walls of
paintings that jut out here and there the various corridors
which lead from room to room and the sculptures which block
sight lines Now we find - Vincent pressed against a wall a
gun in each hand while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting
him down We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split
up and look for Vincent all the while speaking in low Russian
voices Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees -
Nothing No Vincent Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES
through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall Its
Vincent His hand wraps around Mafia Guys neck pinning him
in place Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the
painting hitting Mafia Guy in the head Now - The other men
are alerted by the shots they come running and - Vincent steps
out firing -

And now its a bullet-fest as he gets the drop on them
using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage
gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three and then -
No four Vincent turns surprised that his man wasnt where
he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT hitting
Vincent a flesh wound that disarms him The Last Guy has
the drop on Vincent Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty
little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A
BULLET bursts out of the Last Guys chest Its Sam Now
Sam and Vincent exchange a look Sam has once again saved
Vincents life

VINCENT
You have to stop doing that

SAM
Ill work on it

The two men dont have time for any more words they move
from the Gallery and find themselves in -

THE DINING ROOM -
Where they find nothing but the bloody remains of Mikhi the
Gangster Sam and Vincent are surveying the room when a
VOICE comes from BEHIND them -

SEAMUS (0S)
Turn around real slow and try hard not
to breathe when you do it

ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus Reilly has come in behind them and
hes got his gun pointed straight at Sams heart If Seamus
is enraged at discovering Gregors absence hes overjoyed to
find Sam in his place

SEAMUS
Its you
(touches his face)
Youre the one did this to my face are
you

SAM
Thats me

SEAMUS
Have a nice afterlife

Seamus pulls the trigger and his BULLET spins out towards
Sam ready to blow a hole through him except that - Vincent
leaps forward and takes the bullet -- it rips into his side
a huge splash of red against his white shirt He falls to
the ground horribly wounded but hes given Sam enough time
and now - Sam and Seamus open fire on one another - BULLETS
RIPPING into the table chewing up the china and crystal
taking glass shattering bites out of the CHANDELIER above the
table turning the Dining Room from a primo Louis XIV
showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then
suddenly - Theyre face to face each with a gun to the other
- Mexican Standoff Suddenly from Off Screen -

DEIRDRE (0S)
Seamus

ANOTHER ANGLE - Deirdre has appeared her gun leveled at the
two men

SEAMUS
Deirdre do for him woman put a fucking
bullet in his head

Deirdre hesitates uncertain

SEAMUS
Do it for Christs sake do it so we can
find that stinking Gregor hes got the
bloody package For Gods sake youre a
soldier

These last words sink into Deirdre she is a soldier Her
gun swivels towards Sam

SEAMUS
(sensing hes getting to
her)
Youre one of usYou been born and bred
with your own people you cant go
against your nature Cmon girl Im
youre people

Deirdre makes up her mind

DEIRDRE
Im no girl Seamus

She fires a shot - Blowing Seamus off his feet and through a
huge PLATE GLASS WINDOW

DEIRDRE
And you aint nobodys people

She moves with Sam to Vincent who is seriously wounded --
perhaps life-threateningly so

SAM
(to Deirdre)
Lets get him out of here

VINCENT
Finish the job

SAM
And now

VINCENT
(a commanding whisper)
Finish it

Sam considers but before he can make up his mind Deirdre
sees something through the wreck of the Dining Room Window -

OUT ON THE BACK LAWN - Weve already seen that its bordered
on one side by the woods for the first time we notice - A
LAKE which laps against a PRIVATE DOCK where a row boat is
tethered Now - BENEATH A VERY FULL MOON the stark figure
of Gregor makes its way toward the Dock
DEIRDRE
(calling out)
Sam

Sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees Gregor making
his escape Sam looks back at Vincent who is almost passed
out from blood loss

VINCENT
Im really sick of you saving my life Go
out and get the bastard

Same makes up his mind and as Vincent passes out Sam runs
out after Deirdre and towards -

THE PRIVATE DOCK -
And as the two of them run we MOVE WITH THEM

DEIRDRE
Hes got the briefcase rigged to explode
five seconds after anybody other than
himself tries to open it

And now they reach the Dock and they find - Nothing -- no
Gregor And the Boat is still there Before Sam can
restrain her - Deirdre stps out towards the Boat

SAM
Deirdre wait up --

But its too late Gregor steps out from behind -

A BOATHOUSE and before Deirdre can even figure out what
happened Gregor has her in an arm lock a gun to her head
His free hand sticks out and we see the Briefcase which is
still handcuffed to his wrist

GREGOR
You might have made a good field agent
you arrogant American prick but youre
not smart enough to go up against me

Gregor and Deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake This
Private Dock is made completely of stone and the drop to the
water is nearly five feet Sam has reached a position where
there is no right answer Still he points his gun at
Gregor who in turn shields himself with Deirdres body

GREGOR
Go ahead shoot Shoot and kill the
bitch I dont care

(beat)
And yet you dont shoot Interesting
Put down your weapon and walk away

DEIRDRE
Dont do it Sam

GREGOR
Shut up

DEIRDRE
Hell kill me anway Sam shoot though
me and kill this fucker

SEAMUS (0S)
(a horrible croak)
If you dont I will

ANOTHER ANGLE - Seamus is somehow still barely alive -- hes
not long for this world but the will for revenge has driven
him this far

SEAMUS
(to Sam in a cold pale rage)
Shoot that traitorous bitch and Ill let
you live

THE TOP OF SEAMUSS HEAD explodes finishing him off once and
for all killed by -

Vincent who has staggered out to make this one necessary
shot But he can go no further and he collapses in his own
blood near death just as - Gregor takes a step towards the
boat and - Sam makes up his mind and shoots - THE BULLET
FLIES ACROSS THE SCREEN -

IMPACT - The Briefcase bursts shot open by Sam and now were
in SLOW MOTION as -

Gregor relaxes his grip on Deirdre as he struggles to close
the case and - Deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the
other into the lake while -

BABOOM The case EXPLODES a flash of phosphorescent white
light that incinerates Gregor and the case and whatever was
inside it with an explosion that knocks Sam to the ground and
when the light clears - Gregor and the case are gone while -
THE EXPLOSION ECHOES out over the lake booming again and
again until finally there is - SILENCE Sam looks out over
the lake for any sign of Deirdre - But there is none And
then after weve held for a BEAT longer than it should be

possible for her to have survived - her head splits the
surface and she emerges coughing Sam reaches down to help
her out

SAM
Are you alright

DEIRDRE
Alright Its bloody fucking freezing in
here

Sam pulls Deirdre out of the water and then the two of them

immediately turn and move towards Vincent and as they do we
start to PULL BACK on them and now the SOUNDS of SIRENS can
be heard one then two more and then a symphony of noise

And were STILL PULLING BACK ON -

THE CHATEAU - Or whats left of it because its started to
burn and quickly the flames start to rise into the night
like something out of medieval times as we -

DISSOLVE TO
INT A HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - NIGHT

Sam waits outside a hospital room inside of which we get a
glimpse of - A DOCTOR tending to a heavily bandaged and
sedated Vincent As Sam waits - TWO GENDARMES anda
PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVE approach The Detective looks at Sam
for a BEAT and then goes to push past him Sam blocks his
way

DETECTIVE
I need to speak with that man

SAM
Im sorry I cant allow that

Sam reaches into his coat and for a moment everybody thinks
hes going for his gun but instead he comes out with - A
PIECE OF PAPER He hands it to the Detective
SAM
Call that number and ask them what you
should do
The Detective eyeballs the number suspiciously

FIVE MINUTES LATER -

The Detective hangs up a nearby wall phone and then looks
over at Sam in disgust Without another word the Detective
signals to the two Gendarmes and all three men exit Now -

The DOCTOR a beautiful French Woman comes up and speaks to
him in FRENCH -- and the amazing thing is that Sam speaks
back Everything in SUBTITLED

DOCTOR
You can see your friend now

SAM
Thank you very much

DOCTOR
The field dressing you put on saved his
life
(giving him a look)
Where di you learn to do that

SAM
Here and there I guess

The Doctor isnt entirely satisfied with this answer but
its the only one shes going to get because Sam moves past
into -

INT VINCENTS ROOM

Hes barely alive -- but alive nonetheless And hes heard
Sam speak in French to the Doctor

VINCENT
You son-of-a-bitch

SAM
What

VINCENT
You speak French

SAM
What of it

VINCENT
(in mock exasperation)
Nothing

He lies back on his pillow pissed and yet amused

VINCENT
(repeating the Doctors words
in English)
Your field dressing saved his life
Thats three I owe you

SAM
You dont owe me a goddamned thing
Vincent and you know it You stepped in
front of a bullet for me
(very seriously he now
believes this)
I owe you a heavy debt

VINCENT
(relishing this)
I know
SAM

(rising to leave)
You better get some sleep alright

VINCENT
Tell me something first
(a quick beat)
The package what was it

SAM
I dont know Nobody knows except a
bunch of people who are too dead to tell
us Theres probably a couple of guys
back at the Company who know but I dont
think they plan to tell me anytime soon

VINCENT
What happened to it

SAM
Gone Destroyed

VINCENT
(sighs then a beat)
I guess thats for the best

Sam turns for the door but Vincent has one last thing to say

VINCENT
Sam when Gregor had Deirdre by the lake
you could have killed the two of them
with one shot You could have had the
package finished the job But you
didnt you sacrificed the job to save
her life Why

Same has to think about this for a second and his answer
reveals just how full circle hes come
SAM
Its what you would have done

And on that note Sam exits the room leaving a bemused
Vincent behind

EXT THE BANK OF THE RIVER SEINE - EARLY MORNING

A WISPY FOG atmospherically rises off the river -- not too
thick not too thin

A TITLE One month later

Were MOVING along the cobble-stone walk next to the river as
a VOICE cuts through the fog

VINCENT (VO)
Would you just smoke already

A RIVERSIDE CAFE - Where Sam Vincent and Deirdre are having
morning coffee A mostly-healed Vincent is smoking a
cigarette trying to get Sam to light up

SAM
I told you I quit

VINCENT
Just to keep me company Sam -- I hate
smoking alone
(turning to Deirdre)
How about you I thought all you IRA
types smoked

DEIRDRE
Only the stupid ones Cigarettes kill
more patriots than bullets
(a quick beat)
Besides Im not IRA no more

VINCENT
So where do you go from here

DEIRDRE
I dont know I was thinkingMaybe the
three of us might partner up -- guns for

hire that sort of thing

VINCENT
Im up for that

The two of them turn to Sam but he shakes his head
SAM
Not me You work too often with the same
people and you become friends -- clouds
your judgement

DEIRDRE
Come off it Sam -- if we werent friends
already we wouldnt be here now would
we

VINCENT

Shes got a point

(playing a trump card)
Besides I know of a job thats
available

Sam cant help it -- hes interested

SAM
How much does it pay

SLAM CUT TO
EXT OUT ON THE RIVER SEINE - MEANWHILE

SILENCE AND FOG A RIVER FERRY does a slow ghostly glide
down the river and in seconds it approaches -

THE RIVERSIDE CAFE which appears through the mist looked at
by --

A SLEEK PAIR OF SUN GLASSES attached to a young PUNK in a
leather coat and the Punk is looking at - Sam Vincent and
especially Deirdre Sam looks up and shouts a warning as -
The Punk pulls a shotgun from beneath his leather coat pumps
the gun and screams out at Deirdre with an Irish accent -

PUNK
This is for Seamus

BOOM The Punk pulls the trigger a blast of fire as - Sams
gun is already out TWO QUICK SHOTS squeezed off and - The
Punk is capped twice in the head dead sailing away on the
Ferry which never stops as -

THE CAFE goes wild CUSTOMERS running screaming WAITERS
dropping their trays But - Sam doesnt run and neither
does Vincent Sam stands stunned by what he sees - Deirdre
lies on the ground hit full on in the chest shes dead A
BEAT OF PURE SILENCE - Broken by SIRENS in the distance but
quickly growing closer Now - Vincent looks at Deirdres
corpse then at Sam who is unable to move For maybe the
first time in his professional career Sam is staggered by
the loss of a life Vincent gently takes Sams arm

VINCENT
(soft yet urgent)
We have to go Sam we cant be here

Sam looks at Vincent and for a moment Sam struggles to find
something to say but he cant find a goddamned thing The
SIRENS are getting louder -

VINCENT
(a little louder bordering
desperation)
Lets go

Vincent literally drags Sam away and now the SIRENS have
arrived followed quickly by - THE GENDARMES who come
running into the Cafe but - Its empty except for Deirdres
body Now -

THE STREET ABOVE THE RIVER -

Sam and Vincent are running through patchy fog Vincent
leading the way and now -

Were CLOSER ON Vincent as he runs and runs and runs until he
feels hes far enough away from the scene of the crime to
relax He collapses against a stone wall chest heaving
shaking out two cigarettes one for himself and one for Sam

VINCENT
(thrusting the cigarettes out to
Sam)
Doctors orders

But Sam isnt there to take the cigarette -- Vincent looks
around trying to see what happened to his friend but the
fog has covered any sign of Sam Vincent stands there
stunned alone the cigarettes in an outstretched hand that
slowly falls back to Vincents side as he realizes that Sam
has left him on purpose Then - Vincent lights both
cigarettes at the saem time and throws one of them over the
stone wall - THE GLOWING CIGARETTE arcs through the air until
it lands in the river where it extinguishes with a hiss

VINCENT (0S)
Goodbye Sam

BACK AT THE CAFE -
The Gendarmes have secured the scene (there isnt much to
secure since everyone has run away) A majority of cops
surround Deirdres dead body but - One GENDARME wanders
around the cafe looking about and then he sees something

ON THE STREET ABOVE -
A SHAPE IN THE FOG The wind blows and the fog clears for

second and we see that its - Sam Getting one last look
Deirdre Quickly - The Gendarme points Sam out but as he

does the wind continues to blow and - THE FOG swallows Sam

Seconds later the fog clears again and when it does - Sam
gone

FADE OUT
