in bed dry heaving
MELISSA
Why did you do that to yourself Do
you even remember all the stuff you
told me on the phone last night

DANIEL
Not really I was feeling lonely
Im sorry for waking you up last
night to talk to a drunken idiot

MELISSA
Its not OK but Im fine

DANIEL
I still want to meet you though

MELISSA
I dont know

FADE OUT
SUPER TWO WEEKS LATER
EXT PARK - DANIEL AND GIRL WALKING - DAY

Girl is SARAH Daniel and Sarah are walking together but
not too close

DANIEL (VO)
Its been two weeks since my drunken
exuberance Sarah my ex finance is
back to walk over me yet again When
asked about my love life I mentioned
Melissa Of course I changed her
age to 19 I feel like the proverbial
loner mentioning a girl Ive never
met

INT RESTAURANT - DANIEL AND SARAH - DAY

SARAH
Why are you still here You graduated
two years ago Shouldnt you be
moving on

DANIEL
I dont know I guess Im just
waiting for some inspiration To
come out and be like Here I am
world Daniel Weston Im waiting to
write my masterpiece

SARAH
Dont wait too long So how was

your weekend Did you go out

DANIEL
Yeah and I got hit on by some older
chicks

SARAH
Is that good

DANIEL
Its not good or bad they just drank
a little too much and couldnt help
themselves

SARAH
Ahh Okay

DANIEL
Probably thought that if I got drunk
enough Id take them home kinda
sad actually

SARAH

Im sure So nothing came of that

DANIEL
Umnot exactly my type Yeah there
were no girls for me no one that
was interesting at least

SARAH
Interesting enough to what

DANIEL
To date I want to be blown away
but I havent met a girl yet whos
done that to me Maybe its not
even possible I mean Ive loved
girls but I havent been blown away
by them

SARAH
Um thanks

DANIEL
I didnt mean it like that

SARAH
Yes you did But thats okay You
can care about someone even love
them and not be in love with them
or blown away

DANIEL
I could be in love with Melissa like
that but Id have to see her in
person to really know Ah fuck it
Ill just stick to working a lot
and going out by myself
SARAH
Right Anyway it would be hard to
know what your feelings really are
without spending time in the flesh

DANIEL
(teasingly)
Its all about the flesh

SARAH
Mmmm Apparently its not because
as you say you have no problem with
that area

DANIEL
I was kidding Sex is easy but sex
with passion and meaning yeah
thats the good stuff Anyway at

least part of you still has to find
some strange unexplainable attraction
to the directionless writer still
searching for that special thought

SARAH
Maybe but only a little part

DANIEL
(awkward silence)
I know So how are you and your
husband doing

SARAH
Were fine

DANIEL
You look really happy together

SARAH
Thanks we are Stop trying to change
the subject Why havent you met
Melissa yet

DANIEL
She says shes not ready to meet me
yet and that she feels pressured

SARAH
Thats odd dont you guys talk
all the time

DANIEL

Yeah but remember shes only si-
ah 19 and I kinda called her drunk
awhile ago and said some things

SARAH

What things
DANIEL
Its embarrassing I asked her to
marry me told her I loved her and
well you know

SARAH
No wonder she doesnt want to meet
you right away

DANIEL
Maybe I should stop talking to her
tell her I dont want to do the wrong
thing and mess her life up

SARAH
Right Then youll start drinking
and call her and all this shit will
come out and you wont even remember
what you said to her

DANIEL
I dont do that anymore

SARAH
Yeah Famous last words Daniel

DANIEL
I promised Id stop

SARAH
Promised who You even used to call
me drunk

DANIEL
What
SARAH
You used call me and beg me to live
with you kiss you all that stuff
DANIEL
(embarrassed)

Ahhh you never told me all that
before Im sorry about that

SARAH
If I had a boyfriend who was doing
that You have a habit of doing this
and not just in isolated incidents

DANIEL
So what would you recommend

SARAH
No more whacked out phone calls
obviously And honestly I would
want to meet her in person to try

and see if your feelings are real

and if she feels the same Youll

gain a much clearer and accurate

idea of the situation and the type

of relationship that may exist between
the two of you in the real world

not virtual land Now there is a
huge risk in that because what if
they are real and she still doesnt
feel the same for you It will hurt
like a bitch but at least youll
know and you can stop putting
yourself out there Even though
thats a worst case scenario there

is a positive side to it because

you will definitely get closure either
way

DANIEL
Well she doesnt want to meet me
yet Shes all fucked up

SARAH
I think she does shes just nervous
Just explain it to her the way Ive
explained it to you If she really
cares about you as a true friend
and not some trophy who is infatuated
with her then shell want to do
whatever she can to help salvage the
friendship while still respecting
your honest feelings for her

DANIEL
Okay I guess Ill do what I
originally wanted and take her out

SARAH

Okay lets get your terminology
right first You wont be taking
her out youll be meeting her
Its the difference between sounding
sleazy and sounding decent Those
are the little things that freak
girls out

DANIEL

All right well see what happens
Thank you though I appreciate you
your advice on this

CUT TO
Daniel and Sarah are getting ready ready to leave

SARAH
My husbands waiting for me but
its been fun catching up with you
and Im sure well see each other
around

(teasingly)

No problem
Daniel sets some money on the table
DANIEL

Yeah it is

More silence less awkward this time Daniel looks at Melissa
and they giggle a little

DANIEL

Daniel and Melissa sitting on a picnic table They are sitting

DANIEL
Well I want to do something
special Something youve never done

MELISSA

Well name something and Ill tell
you if Ive done it or not

DANIEL

Skydiving

DANIEL

fun

MELISSA
Yes I know but why would I want to
jump out of a plane

DANIEL
It would be fun Im serious we
should go skydiving

Melissa shakes her head amused

DANIEL
The only thing is that I heard the
first time you jump you have to go
strapped to someones crotch
MELISSA
(shaking her head

vehemently)
No
DANIEL
Yeah
MELISSA

Im not doing it

DANIEL
(laughing)
Wha why

MELISSA
Hello jumping out of a plane however
far up that is and being strapped
to someone and maybe having my
parachute not come out

DANIEL
(flirtatiously)
You can go strapped to me if you
want
MELISSA

Have you ever skydived before

DANIEL
(laughing)
Of course I do it all the time

Melissa is looking at him suspiciously She suspects hes
just teasing her

MELISSA
Are you just kidding

Daniel is laughing again

DANIEL
Anyways um actually the reason you
have to go strapped to someone is
because 1 out of 100 people have
faulty parachutes

MELISSA
Exactly

Daniel nudges her a little smiling
DANIEL
(teasingly)

Just kidding Youre scared

MELISSA
I am

Daniel leans a little closer nudging her with his shoulder
Its obvious she likes the attention but still feels a little
nervous around him

DANIEL
Maybe we should go see a scary
movie

MELISSA
I told you how I feel about scary
movies

DANIEL

Yet you watch them by yourself in
the dark when youre bored

MELISSA

(smiling sheepishly

and giggling)

hell out of me Ima freak

DANIEL
Well theyre beautiful but theyre
also dilating

MELISSA
What does that mean

DANIEL
That you like what youre looking
at
MELISSA
Is that really what it means

DANIEL
Actually yeah In magazines they
dim the lights before taking the
shots so the models look excited and
like they enjoy staring at the
intended audience so what do you

Again he leans into her a little trying to be seductive
Shes shy

MELISSA

FADE TO BLACK
INT COMMONS - COMMON AREAS - COUCH

Daniel is hanging out with CASEY again They are both
drinking beer

CASEY
Hey Im going to try and get some
shrooms this weekend Do you want
to trip with me

DANIEL
I dont think so Ive never done
that before
CASEY
Have you tried any psychedelics
before

DANIEL
No

CASEY
Thats like dying and having never
had sex

DANIEL
dont know about that Ive seen
them do some bad things to my friends
Nightmares flashbacks etc

H

CASEY

Oh that only happens if you way over
do it Its not something youre
suppose to do all the time just
every once in a great while

DANIEL
Yeah but whats the point

CASEY
It gives you a new perspective and
takes you completely out of your
element Its a little hard too
explain to someone who has never
experienced it before

DANIEL
Doesnt it make you stupid

CASEY
Do I seem stupid to you Wait
dont answer that Anyway it changes
you but for the better It improves
your creativity It could give you
that inspiration youre always looking
for

DANIEL
Yeah but I dont think its worth
the bad things It can do

CASEY
Well I believe in the 50 times rule
After 50 times you have permanent
psychosis cause there is only so
much your mind can take before it
completely detaches from reality
Well heave youve ever read or heard
about the LSD experiments the
government did They experimented
on some their top scientists without
their knowledge They were dosed
with an insanely high amount and
tripped for like a week Afterwards
they returned to their normal jobs
and continued working for the
government except for one guy who
went completely insane and then tried
to sue the government for causing
his mental illness He tried to
kill everyone that turned completely
homicidal My mother works as a
nurse at Precious Heart Hospital and
the third floor is completely devoted
to mental patients that cant come
back into society and most of them
are former drug addicts People
that abuse meth really bad can go
into a homicidal psychosis
permanently where they are always
trying to kill random people and
have delusions of persecution

DANIEL
Crazy you definitely dont make it
sound very appealing

CASEY
Well thats only in the extremes A
little bit completely changes you
but for the better You should try
it sometime

DANIEL
No thanks Ive talked to too many
hippy fucks who try to tell me
everything theyve learned from
tripping It usually consists of
seeing how its all energy that comes
up from the ground and flows through
everything cause everything is
connected and that theyve learned

so much but cant describe it Im
like OK youve learned nonsense
great

CASEY
How was your date with Melissa

DANIEL
It was great actually Shes a really
cool girl

CASEY
Have you hit it yet

DANIEL
No and I dont want to right away
I really like this girl

CASEY
Oh come on Mr Insomniac Why would
you want to wait Dont you get
tired of jacking off to internet
porn

DANIEL
Haha

CASEY
The Donkey show is a lot less
interesting the 18th time
DANIEL
(Laughing)

Youre a fucking pervert

Casey begins making humping noises and moving his hips back
and forth He continues and gets really into it

A COLLEGE GIRL
enters the common area and stares at Casey He doesnt notice
her at first Then he stops and looks embarrassed He tries

to play it cool

CASEY
Hi What are you up to

FADE TO BLACK
INT DANIELS ROOM - DAY
Daniel sits on his bed writing rapidly
CLOSEUP - NOTEBOOK
DANIEL (VO)
Slowly running my hand over her face

the tips pressing ever so softly
against her skin from her lips to

her neck to her chest over her
belly and down to her
(sigh)

Gazing into her eyes enveloped in
utter stillness thrust against her
skin stillnesskisses lips parted
slightly as my tongue caresses the
soft warmth of her tender neck The
small quivers of skin eruptions
spilling gently against my fingers

as I run them across her naked back
hands exploring the intricacies of
her soul Long kisses hot as I

press my lower lip against her skin
moving slowly building into fast
deep kisses that touch every inch of
her body Moaning clenched in my
arms hot sweaty hard then
soft the shock and vibration of
her body as I stroke her to
distraction continuing the rhythm
with every thrust slowly increasing

harder faster eyes locked
building skin inflamed hot
scorching no release then

ahhhhhhhh ecstasy sweet hot and
intense When youre lying in post-
coital sweat every fiber of your
body screaming with exquisite
sensitivity drained the muscles
relaxed poured onto the bed as the
breath steadies lying next to
perfection then my friend youve
found heaven

Daniel smiles He looks down at his writing again
DANIELS POV

The scrawled jumbled writing on the page

BACK TO SCENE

DANIEL
(Softly smiling to
himself)
Well its quite obvious Im a horny
bastard

EXT FIELD SOMEWHERE - DANIEL AND MELISSA ARE PLAYING

Daniel and MELISSA are running around having fun and being
goofy

DANIEL
Have you seen Dirty Dancing

MELISSA
Who hasnt Thats the best movie
ever

They continue to play around They are laughing and having
fun Melissa runs and jumps on Daniel he isnt ready and
almost falls over and they are unsuccessful They both laugh

DANIEL
Wait you have to warn me first OK
Lets try it slowly this time

MELISSA
They try again

Okay Dont drop me

laughing

They go over to a tree Daniel helps Melissa climb

trouble

Melissa is laughing He boosts her up and steps back

DANIEL

DANIEL
Yes you can Ive got you Push
Higher Come on Ive got you Use
some upper body strength

She doesnt balance right and again they

both laughing

MELISSA
I need to get up more Daniel
Daniel

She continues to dangle Daniel laughs watching and smacks
her bottom They laugh again Its obvious theyre having

fun

FADE TO BLACK

INT DANIELS ROOM - NIGHT

Daniel and Melissa are hanging out

They are sitting on

Daniels bed Melissa is holding the script for Harmony

MELISSA
Harmony is really good I like the
how the demon whose haunting him is
really himself

DANIEL
That was supposed to be the most
powerful part The realization that
all his problems all his hate and
everything that was combined and
traced out towards the world is really
a reflection of his own cruelty rather
than the cruelty of the world The
metaphor of the demon being a young
version of himself

MELISSA
I love the symbolism its great
DANIEL
You should help me write something

MELISSA
Help you how

DANIEL
UM help me with some ideas
MELISSA
I read
DANIEL
(teasingly)

Give me some crazy ideas I know
youre a literature nut

MELISSA
I read books I like looking at them
and analyzing them but as for
writing thats all you I can help
you edit help you submit it to
publishers but thats about it

DANIEL
That would be cool how do you
know so much about publishing and
editing and stuff

MELISSA
My parents have a small publishing
business Its actually pretty
successful so Ive been immersed in
the publishing world all my life
Its probably why I love books though
I should be sick of them at this
point

Daniel is surprised

DANIEL
Crazy How come you never mentioned
that before

MELISSA
I dont know I didnt really think
about it I guess

DANIEL
Hmm I need to write something

bigger better than Harmony

MELISSA
Why bigger Why not start off little

DANIEL
He points

I want something Ima
perfectionist I hate reading my own
work

to Harmony

DANIEL
When I read something like that I
think ah this is horrible which
is normal I guess I know its okay
but its not what I want

MELISSA
So another random question Whats
the first thing you look at in someone
when youre trying to figure out
whats going on in their head Whats
going on in their mind

DANIEL
Where did that come from

MELISSA
I dont know Nowhere I guess
Just thoughts

DANIEL
Just thoughts huh There are a lot
of things I look at How theyre
body moves how they move their
hands but mostly their eyes Their
eyes show if theyre in pain happy
or sad if theyre anxious or they
want something Get an in depth look
at their personality

MELISSA
You can tell all that from someones
eyes

DANIEL
Yes and a lot more

MELISSA
What do you see in my eyes

DANIEL
I see beauty and innocence anda
die-hard romantic but you are

kind of hard to read

MELISSA
Whys that

DANIEL
You just are I dont make the rules
Why are you laughing
MELISSA
I dont know its hard when
someones talking about you and what
youre like And I am a hopeless

romantic you got that right
DANIEL
And much more whats your biggest

fear Melissa

MELISSA
That Ill never fall in love

DANIEL
I guarantee that wont happen

MELISSA
How do you know I havent fallen
in love yet

DANIEL
Well for one thing ormones and
nature will make you fall in love
sometime no matter what

MELISSA
I hate that you think like that

DANIEL
If you put two people on an island
with no one else theyll fall in
love Nature has a part in love too
you know But its not a bad thing
nature is beautiful love is
beautiful I just understand how it

works Nature is a catalyst for
your feelings it doesnt create
your feelings but it can help you

realize them Does that makes sense

MELISSA
Kinda but I dont know I believe
in soul mates That there is one

person you are destined to be with
Daniel smiles
MELISSA
What I really do I know its silly
but I cant help it
DANIEL
Its not silly its cute Youre

cute

MELISSA
(smiles sweetly up at
him)
So whats your biggest fear

DANIEL
Being alone like ending up alone

MELISSA
I thought you said nature would make
sure you fell in love

DANIEL

Yeah but being in love doesnt mean
you wont be alone the only thing
that really exists is the moment
right now thats my biggest fear
being trapped in fleeting moments
where all I can think about is how
much I love someone and not being

able to express it being forever

aloneno one to care about or share

myself with I hate being alone
MELISSA

Im sure youll never be alone for
any real length of time

DANIEL
Whys that

MELISSA
Because youre too nice a guy

DANIEL
Oh god please dont say that

MELISSA
Say what

DANIEL
You just called me a nice guy

MELISSA
So

DANIEL
Girls dont like nice guys

MELISSA
I do

Melissa leans over and kisses Daniel softly on the cheek

MELISSA
Have you ever been in love before

DANIEL
Once

MELISSA
Really

DANIEL
Yeah

MELISSA

Why didnt it work out

DANIEL
She was very career oriented which
is cool but I was still an undergrad
and she graduated and was going to
leave for grad school I had to stay
and finish my degree I dont do
long distance relationships so it
was goodbye I dont want someone
without ambition but I do want
someone who will support me and will
make decisions in our best interest
And at the time I didnt plan on
being suck in this same city

MELISSA
Why are you still here

DANIEL
Still waiting for my inspiration I
am going to write something incredible
someday

MELISSA
What happened to her

DANIEL
She moved met someone else and got
married

MELISSA
Wow that was quick

DANIEL
Well shes a little older than me
so it was probably her time

MELISSA
Whats a little older

DANIEL
Two years

MELISSA
Whats name

DANIEL
Sarah

MELISSA
Do you still love her

DANIEL
Ill always love her I think if you
really love someone that your feelings
will never go away

MELISSA
Oh I guess I sort of understand
Daniel do you care that Im only
16

DANIEL

Of course not I think its hot
Whats sexier then a beautiful young
girl

MELISSA
Is that the only reason you like me
I mean why do you like me so much
what makes me so different

DANIEL
Oh come on now I love how you
look at me how you talk the
excitement in your eyes when we talk
about playing tag on moon why
would you ask me that

MELISSA
(shyly looking down)
I dont know

DANIEL
(softly)
Melissa

MELISSA
(Looks up)
Yeah

DANIEL
Can I kiss you

Melissa looks into Daniels eyes He slowly moves his finger
to the side of her face He runs them down her neck and
slowly on to her chest

Melissa closes her eyes then opens them and looks excited
but slightly nervous

Daniel leans forward and kisses her They pull apart
smiling
