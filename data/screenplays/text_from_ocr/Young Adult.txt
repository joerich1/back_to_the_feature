EXT HIGH SCHOOL (FANTASY) - DAY
MUSIC UP

We fade into a scene with all the stylistic hallmarks of
a CLASSIC DREAM SEQUENCE A high school on a sprawling
verdant campus A sign reads WAVERLEY PREP Shiny sports
cars enter and exit the circular drive

A beautiful STUDENT crosses the lawn Sunglasses disguise
her true age-- she might as well be a teenager She wears
a private school uniform (plaid skirt blouse and argyle
socks) and carries a stack of seemingly random books

We hear only the peaceful chirping of birds the
student’s quiet footsteps and the distant muffled
conversations of students Nothing looks quite real

Suddenly we hear a bell ringing Kids quickly to filter
into the school But our student doesn’t seem to know
where to go She lowers her sunglasses confused She
fumbles for a CLASS SCHEDULE

The girl glances down at her watch a gaudy surreal-
looking pink Rolex that resembles nothing Rolex has ever
made The ringing is coming from the watch

INT CONDO - MORNING

The ringing continues growing more shrill Reveal a
black old-fashioned alarm clock from Restoration
Hardware There’s a half-empty wine glass next to the
clock

MAVIS GARY stirs in bed She’s mid-thirties blonde
attractive Though Mavis is clearly an adult we

recognize her as the student from the dream

Mavis smacks the clock with surprising violence and goes
back to sleep

The alarm bell rings again brutal

Mavis gets up and walks into the bathroom She’s not
wearing any pants or underwear

INT CONDO (KITCHEN) - SAME

Mavis now wearing unflattering pajama pants enters the

kitchen We see an empty whiskey bottle on the kitchen
counter and a few empty wine bottles

(CONTTNUED )

She bends down and unlatches a dog crate A small fluffy
DOG appears

MAVIS
Good morning Baguette

Baguette jumps excited Mavis peels back the foil ona
single-serving container of dog food and places it on the
floor She walks away not particularly invested in the
dog’s breakfast

INT CONDO (LIVING ROOM) - SAME

Alone Mavis swats at the air She jumps She gyrates her
hips She looks silly

Reveal she’s playing Wii Fit

A BALCONY is visible through a sliding glass door
Baguette is locked outside He stands on his hind legs
wildly batting at the glass

EXT CONDO (BALCONY) - SAME

Mavis sits on the small steel-girdered balcony in her
pajamas She drinks a can of diet soda Now Baquette is
trapped inside batting wildly at the other side of the
glass

From Mavis’s perch we see downtown Minneapolis the
Mississippi River and other converted loft buildings
that used to be factories and granaries

INT CONDO (OFFICE AREA) - SAME

Mavis sits at her computer Near the monitor we see a
stack of books They’re all titled Waverley Prep and
numbered as if in a series We see 4 27 128 There’s
also a large office binder that says WAVERLEY PREP SERIES
BIBLE

Mavis starts up her computer and opens a text document
called pieceofshitword It’s a work in progress Mavis
appears to be on page 17 The last sentence Mavis has
written reads as follows

“Ashby was the undisputed king bee of Waverley Prep”

Mavis stares at the document without enthusiasm

(CONTTNUED )

She opens her Web browser and goes directly to a
celebrity gossip website She scrolls down the page
pausing over each item staring at the vacant grinning
faces of famous people

She opens another window-- her email She deletes all the
overnight spam We see a message that reads REREREEND
OF SERIES Mavis notices the message perhaps grimacing a
little but doesn’t open it

She then notices a NEW MESSAGE The subject line says
“The best thing that ever happened to us”

Mavis pauses then opens the email We see a large photo
of a NEWBORN BABY in a knitted cap that looks like a
strawberry There’s a small block of text beneath

Mavis’s expression is neutral as she reads the message
She closes the window After a moment she clicks it open
again re-reading

And re-reading

She reaches for a strand of hair near her ear and begins
yanking it in a distracted obsessive-compulsive way

INT CONDO (OFFICE AREA) - SAME

It could be ten minutes later It could be an hour later
Mavis is still in her apartment and still pajama-clad
but now she’s on the phone She paces holding her dog as
if it’s an object

MAVIS
(on the phone)
Are you busy Okay No Well I
just have one quick thing to tell
you I got like a birth
announcement From Buddy
(impatient)

Yes Buddy Slade Well Beth

Beth the wife She must have done

like a “send all” or something
Like a mass email to everyone in
his address book whether they’re
living or dead or even remotely
relevant to the situation One of
those I haven’t talked to him in
God four years

(MORE)

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS (CONTD)

(beat)
‘Bye

Mavis hangs up Then redials
MAVIS (CONTD)

Me again Hi Are you gonna have
lunch today

EXT DOWNTOWN MINNEAPOLIS - DAY

Mavis and her friend VICKI eat McDonald’s in a depressing
courtyard behind a Wells Fargo building VICKI is
upholstered in a cheap business suit from the mall Mavis
is sloppily dressed Vicki gives her the once-over

VICKI
Just FYI not all of us have cushy
joke jobs where we can work from
“the home” Lucky

Vicki’s mouth is full of fries

MAVIS
(dejected )
Yeah Lucky See if you like
always writing the same crap about
the same five teenagers and their
amazing wardrobes

(CONTTNUED )

VICKI
Well at least they don’t put your
name on the cover

This hurts Mavis’s feelings but she plays it off

MAVIS
Yeah

VICKI
And aren’t they canceling that
shit anyway

MAVIS
(bristling)
Books don’t get “canceled” Vicki
That’s not the terminology

VICKI
So I put a fake profile up on a
dating site today Just to see
what happens

MAVIS
This birth announcement thing
Buddy

Vicki won’t let Mavis derail her anecdote

VICKI
I said I was a BBW with “luscious
curves”

MAVIS

I don’t understand why they would
send me something like that

VICKI
I bet I get all black guys

MAVIS
Listen

VICKI
(annoyed)
What You’re still talking about
Buddy Slade and his wife and their
email thing

MAVIS
Yeah The baby was just born like
a month ago I mean when you send
something that soon isn’t it just
for the inner circle

(MORE)
(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS (CONTD)
Not for the ex-girlfriend of the
father who doesn’t even talk to
him anymore

VICKI
Buddy’s always been the type to
reach out Remember in school he
was so friendly to everyone Like
he would always pick the
wheelchair guy for his lab partner

and stuff
MAVIS
My cousin
VICKI

wheelchair

Mavis picks at her food dejected

MAVIS

Peter

VICKI

Peter Pussy Eater with the Rolex
What are we doing Why are we not
more excited

MAVIS
(flat)
I am excited

Vicki’s laugh is a disrespectful honk

VICKI
You’re more worked up about your
“soul mate” Buddy

MAVIS
I’m not I just wanted to tell you
about something that happened
God excuse me

VICKI
Buddy Slade is not and never was
all that He still lives in
Mercury for God’s sake

MAVIS
By choice

(CONTTNUED )

VICKI

Vicki points with a french fry her mouth full

VICKI
Were fortunate bitches

She gags violently reaching for her Coke

INT APARTMENT — DAY

Mavis returns from her lunch with VICKI She greets
Baguette who jumps at her knees

MAVIS
Hi Baguette

She slides the door to the balcony open Baguette runs
onto the tiny balcony There’s a small patch of Astroturf
with a plastic fire hydrant This functions as Baguette’s
bathroom

MAVIS (CONT’D)
Hurry up Hurry up
(praising)
Good hurry up

Mavis grabs a banana from the kitchen counter As she
peels it she heads back to her office
INT CONDO (OFFICE AREA) - SAME
Mavis contemplates her computer Unable to resist she
opens the birth announcement email again She hits PRINT
INT CONDO (OFFICE AREA) - MOMENTS LATER
Mavis is kneeling in front of the printer She rips an
INK CARTRIDGE out of the bowels of the printer and shakes
it in frustration
MAVIS
(to herself)
Fuck you Goddamit

She locates a hole in the cartridge and SPITS in it
EXT CONDO (BALCONY) - SAME

Mavis sits on the balcony eating her banana and reading
the birth announcement

Bands of strange ink colors run across the baby’s face
making it look alternately pink blue and yellow

INT FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A romantic Warehouse District “gastropub” all exposed
brick and oil lamps This is the kind of place that has
quail on the menu and an organic wine list

Mavis walks in dressed for a date She has legs for
miles but she tugs uncomfortably on the hem of her
minidress

She squints looking for someone A guy wearing a suit
waves her over to his table This is PETER 42 average
looks moderate hair

Mavis heads over to the table

PETER
Hello there

He kisses Mavis on the cheek and she responds in kind

MAVIS
Hi

PETER
I already ordered us some
Malpaques
(explaining)
Oysters

MAVIS
Thank God

She seems to realize how inane her response is
immediately

PETER
How was your day

MAVIS
(lying)
Crazy So busy Just a ton of
stress

(CONTTNUED )

PETER
Working a lot huh

A WAITRESS appears Mavis addresses her without looking
up or offering a greeting

MAVIS

It’s pretty nutso

(to waitress)
Sparkling water Not flat please--
you guys always bring me flat
Anyway I’m just very busy these
days Working working working
Agghh

The waitress disappears

PETER
And you’re still just writing that
high school stuff

MAVIS
Young adult yeah “YA” That’s
what we call it in the publishing
biz There are other acronyms
too

Peter drinks his beer and clinks Mavis’s glass

PETER
Well it’s nice to be dating
someone who’s driven

MAVIS
Ha ha That’s me all right

PETER

I tend to date these really young
women You know they’re more
consumed with their social lives
and looking good and all that I
always tell them “Wait a few
years You’re not going to be able
to rely on that face forever” Am
I right

MAVIS
Mmhm

PETER
I really see someone like you as
more of a peer Those girls are
likeit’s more like I’m a mentor
to them “Peter help me

(MORE)
(CONTTNUED )

PETER (CONTD)
You’re so smart”
(chuckling)
It’s not like I know everything

Mavis suppresses her hostility kind of

MAVIS
That must just annoy you so much

The appetizer has arrived stealing Peter’s attention He
heaps his plate with oysters shaking Tabasco onto their
slimy innards

He slurps an oyster with gusto

INT CONDO (BEDROOM) - MORNING

It’s a gray quiet morning Mavis opens her eyes Peter
is in bed next to her his hand splayed across her back
to reveal his signature Rolex Submariner

Mavis looks at him She lifts his arm as if he’s a
Mannequin and climbs out of bed She crosses the room
wearing Peter’s undershirt and a “date night” thong
Mavis opens her too-small closet and pulls out a gigantic
suitcase She unzips it and places it on the bed She
begins folding clothes and placing them in the suitcase

Mavis packs neatly and judiciously holding up outfits
before they make the final cut

Peter sleeps on oblivious

INT APARTMENT (KITCHEN) - SAME

Mavis now fully dressed struggles to get Baguette into
a small dog carrier Finally she zips up the sides The
carrier wriggles

Mavis throws a few cans of dog food into a large pink
Victoria’s Secret shopping bag

INT APARTMENT (BEDROOM) - SAME

Mavis places a SPARE KEY next to Peter’s sleeping face on
the pillow

INT APARTMENT (FRONT DOOR) - DAY

With the suitcase the bag and the dog in tow Mavis
exits as casually as if she were going to the store

EXT APARTMENT (PARKING GARAGE) - DAY

Mavis enters an underground parking garage packed with
Jettas Priuses and other neglected midprice
hipstermobiles She lugs her suitcase the shopping bag
and Baguette’s carrier

Her MINI Cooper is blocked in by a grid of cars She
tries to squeeze her body through to access the drivers
seat then realizes there’s really no point to that
exercise The car is stuck

EXT APARTMENT (PARKING GARAGE) - SAME

Time has passed Mavis waits in the vicinity of her car
surrounded by her things A PARKING ATTENDANT appears a
calloused slow-moving older man

PARKING ATTENDANT
Looks like you’re stuck

MAVIS
(red-faced)
Yes I’m blocked in

PARKING ATTENDANT
This is long-term parking Usually
need a little advance notice

MAVIS
I know It’s sort of an emergency
It’s a family emergency thing My
father My father’s dying

The attendant climbs into one of the cars behind Mavis’s
MINI and starts the ignition

We can tell by his demeanor that this is going to take a
while

MAVIS (CONTD)
(insincere)
I know I’m the worst Thank you
so so much

EXT APARTMENT (PARKING GARAGE) - DAY

The car exits the garage Mavis is behind the wheel
Baguette is now sitting in her lap panting eagerly
EXT MINNEAPOLIS - DAY

Mavis drives through downtown Minneapolis passing strip
clubs and convention centers

She pauses to gawk at a huge sex shop Orange neon winks
at her from the window

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

Mavis’s car drives down a rural stretch of highway
Factory farms and ruined fields as far as the eye can

see

Mavis takes the exit north toward DULUTH

INT CAR - DAY

Mavis listens to Britney Spears and rolls down the
window A surprisingly strong blast of wind hits her
face messing her hair She rolls the window up again

Baguette gnaws on Pemmican beef jerky on the passenger
seat The wrapper is visible on the floor

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Mavis pumps gas at a truck stop A tweaked-out LOT LIZARD
in full hooker regalia approaches her

HOOKER
You got a quarter five dollars
for my baby

This woman makes Mavis nervous

MAVIS

HOOKER
Because my baby need to eat

MAVIS
Have you tried breastfeeding

(CONTTNUED )

The hooker stares at Mavis incredulously She has a gold
tooth and a large tattoo across her pancake-like breasts
She looks like the exact opposite of a healthy nursing
mother

MAVIS (CONT’D)
My sister’s a lactation coach

Her voice trails off as the woman moves closer Mavis is
unnecessarily firm

MAVIS (CONT’D)
I don’t have anything for you
I’m sorry

The gas pump hiccups to a stop Mavis withdraws the
nozzle and sprays her hand with gasoline

The hooker walks away mumbling

HOOKER
Yankee bitch

MAVIS
Did you just call me a yankee
We’re in Minnesota
Northern Minnesota

EXT HIGHWAY - MAGIC HOUR
Mavis’s car is pulled over to the shoulder of the road
She paces in the gravel while Baguette finds a spot to

pee

Baguette pees Mavis JOGS and LEAPS in place doing some
of her Wii Fit moves even though she’s outside

In the distance we see the shores of Lake Superior

INT CAR - NIGHT

Mavis is parked fumbling through crap in her backseat
She flips through an CD booklet until she finds a CD that
says “Mad love Buddy” in black Sharpie

She pops in the CD

A ‘90s alterna-pop song fills the car It’s “THE CONCEPT”
by Teenage Fanclub

Mavis mouths the words and pulls out a ONE-HITTER She’s
already tamped some pot down into the bowl

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
She wears denim wherever she goes
She’s gonna buy a record from the
Status Quo oh yeah

Mavis lights up contentedly exhaling as the song
crescendos
EXT EXTENDED STAY SUITES - NIGHT
It’s a typically sad long-term lodging establishment
Mavis parks her car and walks toward the main entrance
She carries Baguette in a bag
INT EXTENDED STAY SUITES - LOBBY
A YOUNG GIRL is behind the counter She wears the
requisite business suit but her hair is bleached blonde
and her makeup telegraphs “day shift stripper”
FRONT DESK GIRL
Welcome to Homeway Extended Stay
of Greater Duluth Can I help you

MAVIS
I would like to check in

FRONT DESK Girl
Do you have a reservation

Mavis is mildly annoyed by this basic question

MAVIS
No

The girl recites her spiel as if she’s just learned it

FRONT DESK GIRL

(typing) —
And how long will you be staying
with them

(correcting herself)
Us

MAVIS
I don’t know Maybe just a week or
something It’s a business trip
I’m a lawyer A patent attorney
(beat)
Torts

(CONTTNUED )

The girl peers at Baguette’s bag which is clearly a dog
carrier

FRONT DESK GIRL
Is that a dog in your bag

MAVIS
Nope Diabetes testing supplies

She’s surprised by her own lie

FRONT DESK GIRL
We actually allow small pets with
a cleaning deposit

MAVIS
In fact I do have a dog but he’s
in my vehicle

The bag WRIGGLES wildly betraying Mavis instantly
FRONT DESK GIRL
Okay I’1ll put that you have a
dog

She keys some information into the computer eyeing Mavis
suspiciously

FRONT DESK GIRL (CONT’D)
How many keys do you need

Mavis thinks

MAVIS
Two please

She leans over as the girl makes the keys as if to
supervise The girl rolls her eyes almost imperceptibly

MAVIS (CONT’D)
Twothere we go

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Baguette scampers around on the bed Mavis looks at the
clock then looks at her phone She sits down on the bed
and dials

MAVIS
(loudly into phone)
Personal Mercury Minnesota
Mercury Minnesota Slade

(CONTTNUED )

Baguette urinates on the carpet approximately five inches
from where Mavis has placed a “puppy pad”

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Mavis darts across the pedestrian-unfriendly highway The
only structure we can see is a gas stationconvenience
store starkly illuminated in the darkness

INT GAS STATION - SAME

Mavis runs her finger along the small dim freezer case
She glances at the TEENAGE BOY behind the counter and
smiles

INT MOTEL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Mavis enters the lobby eating a pint of Ben and Jerrys
“Cherry Garcia” ice cream with a plastic spoon

FRONT DESK GIRL
How’s your diabetes

Mavis ignores her quickly heading for the stairwell

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Mavis puts down her ice cream and picks up her cell phone
again

INT MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT

Now Mavis is in the tiny bathroom holding the phone
against her ear

She rolls a miniature shampoo bottle around in her free
hand

MAVIS
Hi Buddy I see this is still your
number This is Mavis You know
Mavis Gary Um what’s up Ha How
are you I’m just in town taking
care of a real estate thing I
thought we could get together for
a drink and catch up Okay Call
me if you’re up for it ‘Bye

(CONTTNUED )

She hangs up and looks in the mirror The cruel
fluorescent light fixture buzzes

Mavis takes her two middle fingers and applies pressure
to a barely visible zit

INT LOBBY - NIGHT

Mavis enters the lobby once again her pace brisk and
businesslike The zit she tried to pop is now an angry
red blotch

The front desk girl is gone Mavis notices this with some
relief

EXT STREETS OF MERCURY - NIGHT

MUSIC UP Buddy’s MIX TAPE

Mavis is back in her car driving into town She passes
a sign that says MERCURY CITY LIMITS

As she enters Mercury proper we can see that it’s a
fairly charming place Suburban houses a classic Main
Street Mercury Senior High School (Mavis slows to peek
at the latter)

It’s literally a drive down Memory Lane Only Memory Lane
has changed a little

MAVIS
(to herself)
They have a Starbucks now

We see a brand new KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKENTACO BELLPIZZA
HUT HYBRID

MAVIS (CONT’D)
And a KenTacoHut

She drives on toward a roadside bar

EXT BLUE HILL BAR - NIGHT
The Blue Hill is a shitty standalone dive bar
Mavis pauses on the road looking at the blinking neon

sign and the tired cars in the gravel lot She pulls in
anyway

(CONTTNUED )

Mavis parks her car As she turns off the car her PHONE
RINGS and she jumps groping for it

MAVIS
(on phone)
Hey you

Her voice is soft and relieved

INT BLUE HILL BAR - NIGHT

Mavis walks in flush with victory Skynrd plays on the
jukebox The whole scene is tragic

It’s a weeknight The place is mainly populated with
barflies and other sad-looking individuals

Mavis sits down at the bar

MAVIS
Maker’s Mark please

The BARTENDER obliges Mavis drinks in such a way that we
can tell she’s an experienced and enthusiastic drinker

Mavis looks around the bar MATT FREEHAUF 36 is
watching her from an adjacent barstool He’s sad-faced
and overweight There’s a STEEL CRUTCH the permanent
kind leaning against his stool

Mavis glances at him She looks away and takes a pink
compact mirror out of her purse She opens the mirror and
checks herself out

She glances over at Matt again He’s still staring
MATT
I’m sorry I believe we attended
high school together In fact we
definitely did

MAVIS
At the same time

MATT
Yes Youre Mavis Gary

MAVIS
Mavis Gary-Crane now

MATT
Oh Congrats on that

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Well I got divorced
MATT
Okay
MAVIS

So it’s just back to Gary I
guess Has been for a while I’m
sorry what is your name

MATT
Matt Freehauf My locker was
actually right next to yours For
all of high school

A flash of recognition Embarrassment

MAVIS
Ohhhh

Her eyes wander to the CRUTCH propped against his stool

MAVIS (CONT’D)
Of course Matt Freehauf Matt
Your locker was right there by

mine
(grasping)
On the second floor of the school
Yeah
MATT

Mm-hm I was out for most of
senior year though

He taps the crutch indicating a connection Mavis

smiles but it’s horribly awkward

MAVIS
Right right

MATT
You may remember me as the “hate
crime guy”
(off Mavis’s look)
Bunch of jocks who thought I was

gay jumped me in the woods and hit

my legs and dick with a crowbar
It was national news I mean
until people found out I wasn’t
actually gay Then it wasn’t a
hate crime It was just a fat guy
getting his ass kicked

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
I do recall that

MATT
I even got my own prayer-a-thon
courtesy of the Lutheran Teen
Club 10 hours of Dear Heavenly
Fathers and I can still only walk
in circles

MAVIS
How’s your dick

MATT
Not good

Mavis nods The bartender pushes a second Maker’s towards
her and she accepts it with a long grateful sip Matt
begins talking again and she cringes

MATT (CONTD)
It’s not like we ran in the same
circles regardless You were
extremely popular if I recall
You won “Best Hair” in the senior
superlatives And I was you know
a big theater fag

MAVIS
So you were gay

MATT
No It’s an expression Theater
fag drama geek

He sighs

MAVIS
Well it’s nice to see you

Mavis taps away at her cell phone idly Matt’s not ready
to end the conversation

MATT
What are you even doing in town I
know you’re not one of the losers
who stuck around

MAVIS
Oh I’m just taking care of this
real estate thing I have some
property so

The lie makes her uncomfortable every time

(CONTTNUED )

MATT
Aren’t you some kind of teen
writer now I read about it in the
Sun How’d you score that gig

MAVIS
Talent

MATT
No offense intended I was just
curious It’s a cool job

Mavis takes another healthy swig from the glass and
squints at Matt suddenly deeming him worthy of honesty

MAVIS
My uncle runs the publishing
house
A surprised half-smile from Matt who appreciates
straight talk Mavis downs the rest of her drink as they
relax into drunken conversation
MUSIC UP as TIME PASSES

DISSOLVE TO

INT BLUE HILL BAR - THREE BOURBONS LATER

Mavis is obviously drunk Her body language is sloppy and
she shouts over the music She leans toward Matt
conspiratorially

MAVIS
I love Taylor Swift

She reaches for a BOTTLE of an unfamiliar beverage which
Matt eyes with some alarm He steadies her arm before she
can spill it

MATT
Careful

Mavis points to the bottle instructively It’s a cheesy
brand of alcoholic CIDER

MAVIS
Hard Jack See This is what Buddy
Slade drinks

She takes a passionate swig MATT is confused

(CONTTNUED )

MATT
That’s a good uh fact
(beat)
So are you seeing your family
while you’re here

MAVIS

My family Fuck my family
MATT

Okay
MAVIS

I don’t have a “good” relationship
with my stepfather right

She makes air quotes around the word good for no reason

MAVIS (CONTD)
When I got married to
AllenAllen is my ex-husband
Allen Crane the retard of
Hennepin County but anyway When
I got married to Allen me and my
stepfather go out to do our
special daddy-daughter dance at
the reception Right Because he
basically raised me inasmuch
aswhatever And I tell you my
stepfather has always been weird
Around me and well just around
me So we go out and this song
starts playing you know

(singing)

I got sunshiiiine

MATT
(nodding)
“My Girl”

MAVIS
And we’re dancing at my wedding in
a whole circle of people and I
suddenly notice that my
stepfatherhasan erection

Matt reels

MATT
That’s dark Mavis

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Dark indeed “That’s dark” I love
how you said that You’re
hilarious

She paws Matt’s arm affectionately

MATT
Thanks

Mavis has reached for a patch of hair behind her ear
She’s pulling at it compulsively fingering the roots

MAVIS

Wanna know why I’m really in town
MATT

Sure
MAVIS

(stage-whispering)
I can’t tell you here man

MATT
(stage-whispering
back)
Okay

EXT BLUE HILL BAR - NIGHT

Mavis and MATT stand in the parking lot near the kitchen
entrance Mavis is SMOKING aggressively As Matt moves
further from the entrance we can see how much effort it
takes for him to walk even with assistance

MATT leans on his crutch waiting for Mavis to speak
MAVIS
I’m here because I’m still deeply

in love with Buddy Slade and I
want him back

MATT laughs assuming this is a joke
MATT
Awesome Buddy Slade I’m pretty
sure Buddy’s married With a kid
on the way

Mavis takes a drag She smokes like a twelve-year-old

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
‘ids ear
(exhales )
The kid’s here She had the baby
I don’t care though I have
baggage too

MATT
Wait are you not joking

MAVIS

I know people won’t understand
but things like this happen They
do happen Usually they happen in
slow-motion Like two people are
meant to be together and then they
slowly get rid of what’s keeping
them apart They get divorced
they reconfigure And everyone’s
cool with that right Society’s
okay with that

(rambling)
Everyone’s a homewrecker we just
wreck very slowly

Matt can barely follow her drunken rant

MAVIS (CONTD)

But see I can’t go slow I have
to tell Buddy now I don’t have
time to play this little game of
decency that everyone is so into

(breaking up)
You see Freehauf I’m 36 I don’t
have time

Matt is momentarily speechless

Mavis focuses her attention on trying to light the wrong
end of another cigarette

MATT
Um I would advise youMavis
Mavis look at me Okay I would
advise you to keep all this to
yourself Talk to a therapist or
something

MAVIS
Hey my friend Kelly is a
therapist My friend Kelly she’s
a therapist at Kaiser Permanente
and--

(CONTTNUED )

MATT
Great Hey just don’t call Buddy
Slade Especially not tonight

Mavis sticks her finger into Matt’s chest aggressively
triumphant

MAVIS
Well I already did I called him
and he called me back We’re
meeting up tomorrow night

She notices a CAB has pulled up and is idling on the
curb

MAVIS (CONT’D)
Oh A cab for me

MATT
Yeah we called them remember
(exasperated)
Listen Buddy already has a life
Without you

Mavis begins walking backward toward the car lecturing
to MATT as she stumbles

MAVIS
A life Babies are boring okay
Buddy’s life is BORING Boring
boring boring boring boring

She climbs into the cab as MATT watches incredulous

MAVIS (CONTD)
(hanging out the

BORING

The cab sputters off into the night MATT waves
halfheartedly
INT MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Mavis wakes up still wearing her clothes from the night
before Her dog is in bed with her

She sits up her hair plastered across her face She
looks across the room and sees vomit on the floor it
appears that she’d tried to clean it up with a MOTEL
towel the night before

(CONTTNUED )

Mavis groans She drinks from a big bottle of water on
her bed table
EXT MERCURY MAIN DRAG - DAY

Mavis trudges along the side of the road in the blinding
sunlight She looks terrible

Cars whiz by as Mavis ambles past the KenTacoHut like a
hobo

EXT BLUE HILL BAR - DAY

Mavis finally arrives at her destination on foot Her car
is alone in the lot There’s a letter on her windshield

“Dont (sic) Park Here Alnight CITY BOY”

She crumples it up gets in and drives away

INT STRIP MALL NAIL SALON - DAY

Mavis sits in a high-tech “throne” Her feet are ina
swirling basin of water The chair vibrates

A young GIRL on her knees buffs Mavis’s feet She reaches
for a pedicure tool

MAVIS

Please don’t use the callous

slicer No don’t Do not

Unsanitary Thanks
INT STRIP MALL NAIL SALON (BACK ROOM) - DAY
A technician applies WAX to Mavis’s eyebrows and rips it
off efficiently Mavis doesn’t flinch
INT MOTEL ROOM (BATHROOM) - day
Mavis SHAVES her legs carefully in the tub It looks like
it’s been a while

INT MOTEL ROOM (BATHROOM) - SAME

Mavis applies MAKEUP with a practiced hand and an arsenal
of expensive brushes

(CONTTNUED )

She coats her face with foundation like a party clown It
looks shockingly natural once blended

As her lips are glossed and her lashes blackened we see
that she’s a truly gorgeous woman

She wraps her hair around a curling iron enjoying the
process of making herself attractive

She pulls back her hair briefly to reveal the pink
balding patch behind her left ear Her “pulling place”
She smooths it then makes sure her hair is pushed
forward to disguise it

INT MOTEL ROOM - DUSK

Mavis sits on the bed staring out the window Waiting
She looks at the digital beside clock It says 431

She looks back out the window as the sun sinks

EXT DOWNTOWN MERCURY - DAY

Mavis drives slowly into Mercury’s modest “downtown”
She’s searching for a new and unfamiliar restaurant

MAVIS
(to herself)
Champion O’Malley’s

She spots it and pulls over gripping the steering wheel

INT CHAMPION O’MALLEY’S - HAPPY HOUR

Champion’s is a slick new SPORTS BAR flooded with
natural light and much more cheerful than the Blue Hill

Mavis is sitting in a polished wood booth She positions
herself so she has a clear view of the door She cranes
her neck ever so slightly

A passing BAR EMPLOYEE plunks down some silverware rolled
in a napkin Mavis recoils tensely

MAVIS
Oh No no I don’t need
silverware

Her voice is a bit too loud

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS (CONTD)
No Thanks I wouldn’t mind two
Hard Jack ciders though

BAR GUY
I’‘1l send over your waitress

Mavis nods She takes out her phone and starts pretending
to compose a text message

Reveal the SCREEN of the phone “jggjsgnkajwhriuawgf”

Mavis glances at the nearest table A couple of GUYS are
eating nachos and watching a basketball game on one of
the overhead TVs One of the guys notices Mavis but the
acknowledgment is minimal

Mavis sits up a little straighter arching her back She
puts her elbows on the table thrusting her breasts
forward She ruins the effect by looking down

Then

BUDDY enters the bar alert but not nervous He’s an
attractive guy in jeans flannel and a baseball cap

Mavis is pretending to text again She glances up at
Buddy with expert detachment smiles and waves slightly

Buddy rounds the corner toward Mavis

MAVIS
Hey you

BUDDY
Wow Great to see you hon

Buddy and Mavis hug Over Buddy’s shoulder we see
Mavis’s thrilled face Her eyes are tightly closed

They separate Buddy slides into the booth across Mavis

BUDDY (CONTD)
So This is a midweek surprise

MAVIS
I know I was just back in town
taking care of some real estate
stuff and I thought

She shrugs

BUDDY
No It’s great I’m glad

(CONTTNUED )

There’s a momentary lull

MAVIS
How are things in “Jerkury”

Buddy squints confused them remembers the old joke

BUDDY
Jerkury I haven’t heard that in a
while Jerkury

A WAITRESS appears

MAVIS
(to waitress)
Excellent A couple of Hard Jacks
please

BUDDY
Whoa Hard Jack I haven’t had one
of those since college

The waitress departs

MAVIS
Oh me neither God But I figured
for old times sake

BUDDY
Honestly I haven’t been drinking
the past few months Beth’s
nursing our girl so I thought
I’d you know show some
solidarity

MAVIS
Of course

BUDDY
You knew I had a daughter right

MAVIS
No duh Everyone knows the whole
gang Yeah I got the
announcement Congratulations on
that by the way

BUDDY
She’s amazing

Mavis laughs lightly it’s almost a hiccup

MAVIS
That must be so great

(CONTTNUED )

BUDDY
One thing’s for sure about being a
parent-- it is never boring

Mavis winces almost imperceptibly remembering the
previous night’s drunken “boring” tirade

MAVIS
I’m just working my butt off
Doing my thing in the city

BUDDY
Right down there in the “Mini
Apple”
MAVIS
(shrill)
Nobody calls it the “Mini Apple”
Buddy God

She laughs slapping his hand He doesn’t recoil but he
doesn’t respond either

MAVIS (CONT’D)
So are you still at General Mills

BUDDY
Yup Ad sales now Don’t love all
the cold-calling but my dad’s
still there so we have lunch
together most days

Buddy notices the WAITRESS preoccupied with another
table

BUDDY (CONTD)
Sorry Hey I’m just gonna grab
those ciders Save our lady a
trip

MAVIS
Ah Very chivalrous

Buddy gets up and heads over to the bar Mavis turns her
head in sync with his departing body staring at him

MUSIC UP Something dreamy sexy and worshipful like “My
Sweet Lord” by George Harrison

In slow motion we see Buddy sidle up to the bar leaning

toward the bartender Mavis’s gaze-- our gaze-- drifts
down his body Suddenly Mavis is alive

(CONTTNUED )

He’s just an average suburban dad but the way Mavis
looks at him he’s the very embodiment of sensuality

His back softened by years of inactivity The hang of
his “relaxed fit” jeans The way his thirty-dollar
haircut feathers against the nape of his neck Mavis
drinks it all in lost in a reverie

On Mavis’s face hopeful and sad at once
Then-- an interruption MATT Freehauf

MATT
Mavis

He’s standing over her booth leaning on his crutch
Mavis is not thrilled to see him

MAVIS
Freehauf What are you doing here

MATT
I work here I do the books and
deal with vendors and other sit-
down jobs that won’t tax my
twisted mangled body And you

MAVIS
(tightly)
Just having a cocktail

MATT
Right I see Buddy up there
procuring a couple of mind-
erasers Not very dignified of
you
Mavis refuses to break
MAVIS
It was good running into you last
night Nice to see you again
She half-waves as if to dismiss him

Buddy appears with the drinks He doesn’t seem super-
tight with MATT but he’s friendly and familiar

BUDDY
Hey Freehauf what’s up mang

Matt high-fives him glancing at Mavis

(CONTTNUED )

MATT
Hi Congratulations on the
little one

BUDDY

Yeah our little Chunka-Boo The
adventure begins

MAVIS
(to Matt)
It’s crazy to see you here I
mean in a good way Thanks for
stopping by

BUDDY
(interrupting)
Maybe you should join us

MAVIS
Ah ha ha ha

MATT
Sadly I must decline I’ve got
work to do and it takes me twice
as long as an able-bodied man to
complete even the simplest task

BUDDY
Bummer

Mavis sees how Matt uses his disability to make people
feel uncomfortable She might even like it

MATT
I‘1l just leave you two to your
little Mercury High reunion

MAVIS
(cheerful)
Go Injuns
MATT

They changed their name to the
Indians in ‘99 It was a whole
thing with the local Fon du Lac
and

(No one is listening)
--whatever

MATT limps away Buddy watches him sympathetically and
takes a sip from the Hard Jack bottle

(CONTTNUED )

BUDDY
Sucks what happened to Matt I
mean the poor guy has suffered so
much just for being gay

We see Matt PAUSE mid-limp several feet away His
shoulders sag with defeat

MAVIS
He’s not actually gay

BUDDY
Well whatever Mercury’s changed
a lot since that happened It’s
way less of a hick town

MAVIS
Really

BUDDY

Well we have this place Beats
the Blue Hill right We have a
cool little record store down on
Frye Street Jim Wysocki opened it
a few months ago and they’re
starting to get some good stuff
And there’s plenty of places to
get coffee

(beat)
Did you see we got a KenTacoHut

MAVIS
I did I did You got choices now

She laughs not sure if they’re being ironic or not

BUDDY
Have you seen your mom and stepdad
yet What’s up with Hedda and Dave
these days

MAVIS
They’re fantastic I havent
actually stopped by yet but I
definitely will Yes I will stop
by Oak Lane I miss them both
A lot

BUDDY
How’s um Allen

Mavis is taken aback by he query

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Allen is well He’s fine
(beat)
We’re not married anymore but

BUDDY
Oh I’m

MAVIS
No but we’re great friends I’ve
got his back and he’s certainly
got mine

Buddy is appreciative of this

BUDDY
I guess something like that never
really goes away

MAVIS
(quickly)
It does go away It does and it
can But there’s still a warmth
there A mutual respect

Buddy tries a sip of Hard Jack and grimaces at the taste

EXT PARKING LOT - EVENING

Mavis walks Buddy to his CAR It’s obvious it hasn’t been
a late night Mavis is still lucid and Buddy is brisk
businesslike

BUDDY
Sorry I can’t hang out longer but
I’ve got to relieve Beth She has
band practice tonight

MAVIS
Beth is in a band

BUDDY
Yeah it’s just something she does
with some other moms

MAVIS
Wow Cool

BUDDY
Beth’s the drummer

MAVIS
Oh my God

(CONTTNUED )

BUDDY
Yup There’s a pretty good rock
scene happening here Actually
Beth’s band playing on Wednesday
right here

He opens his car door and readies himself to climb in

MAVIS
(desperately)
Buddy
BUDDY
Uh-huh
MAVIS

I want to see you More
If Buddy catches her meaning he doesn’t show it

BUDDY
Id be down with hanging out
again How long are you around

MAVIS
Weeks possibly Or a few days
But I am around and I just don’t
want this to be over

Buddy interprets this as nostalgia His tone is
comforting

BUDDY
It’s not it doesn’t have to be I
know I haven’t been the best at
staying in touch but I’m always
here to talk or whatever

MAVIS
Remember Vicki used to always say
you and me were telepathic

BUDDY
You mean Vicki Robek Robotrip
She’s in the “Mini Apple” too
right How is she doing

MAVIS
Oh great She had a cervical
cancer scare but it turned out to
just be HPV

(CONTTNUED )

BUDDY
Cool So uh why don’t you stop
by our place for a hang on
Wednesday We’1ll have dinner and
then we can all go to Beth’s show

MAVIS
Yes

BUDDY
Oh-- you know it would be great
if you could sign one of those
Waverley Prep books for my niece
Kendra She wants to be a writer
too

MAVIS
My name isn’t actually on the
books I mean it’s on the title
page if you check inside but I’m
basically a ghostwriter

BUDDY
Still a pretty big deal compared
to the rest of us

He starts the car and begins to pull out Mavis continues
to speak to him through the open window Her voice is a
desperate cry

MAVIS
See you Wednesday

BUDDY
Yup

He drives away Mavis pretends to walk to her car but
can’t resist looking back

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Mavis sits on the motel bed painting her nails pink She
looks angry Carefully she dials her Blackberry

MAVIS
Mercury Minnesota Residence
Freehauf

After a beat she presses a button on the phone

CROSS CUT
PHONE CALL
INT MATT’S HOUSE - SAME

Matt Freehauf shuffles over to a wall-mounted telephone
in a depressing “country” kitchen that looks like it was

remodeled in 1989 He picks it up

MATT
Hello

Mavis’s tone is sharp teenage-bitchy

MAVIS
Is this Matt

Matt’s sister SANDRA lingers near the phone

Sandra
Who is it

MATT
(annoyed)
I got it Sandra
(to Mavis)
Mavis

MAVIS
Yeah How’d you know

MATT

The caller ID went

(robot voice)
Ma-vis Guh-ree

MAVIS
(flustered)
Well it is me in fact I just
want you to know that what you saw
today wasn’t what you think
it was

MATT
Oh You’re not trying to destroy
Buddy Slade’s marriage

MAVIS
I was over-served last night

MATT
You think Why are you calling Do
you think I’m like the town crier
like I’m going to roam the streets
like an old-timey newsboy
(boyish voice)
(MORE)

(CONTTNUED )

MATT (CONTD)
“Hey everyone Mavis Gary is back
and she’s hatching a scheme”

MAVIS
It’s way more complicated than you
could possibly know Buddy and I
have years of history between us
and it’s very rich and complex
And well you can’t rely on what
people say when they’ve been
overserved

MATT
Really I think drunk people tend
to tell the truth

MAVIS
That’s a cliche

Sandra interrupts Matt brandishing a bottle of KRAFT
RANCH DRESSING

SANDRA
Don’t open a new ranch until the
old one is done

Matt ignores his sister

MATT
You want to drink again tonight

Sandra
(still on the
dressing)
Just so you know

MAVIS
Are you joking

MATT
I have weed

Sandra opens a pizza box on the counter She drizzles a
liberal quantity of ranch dressing onto the pizza

INT MATT’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The doorbell rings Matt answers the door A sheepish
Mavis stands on the doorstep Her makeup so expertly

applied a few hours ago now looks a bit messy

MATT
Come in

(CONTTNUED )

Sandra stands in the messy living room sizing up Mavis
Matt waves at her offhandedly

MATT (CONTD)
My sister Sandra This is her
place

MAVIS
Hi I’m Mavis

SANDRA
I know You tutored me for all of
freshman year

It’s practically an accusation

MAVIS
Right

SANDRA
I made you Rice Krispies squares
that one time for your birthday

There’s old hurt in Sandra’s eyes Mavis nods smiling as
if she remembers

SANDRA (CONTD)
I got your locker combination from
the vice principal and put them in
your locker

MAVIS
That was really nice of you

SANDRA
(to Matt)
Don’t be too loud
MATT
We’re going to my room
INT MATT’S HOUSE (bedroom) - night
If the dynamic between Matt and Sandra seemed stunted
Matt’s bedroom is even worse It looks exactly the way it
might have when he was in high school A twin bed A
record collection
It’s an awkward moment
MATT

This is my room

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Your sister lives with you

MATT
Other way around
(by way of
explanation)
Independent living isn’t so easy
for me

He limps over to an iPod dock

MAVIS
She cooks for you and stuff

MATT
She orders Hungry Howies

MAVIS
I like Hungry Howie’s

MUSIC fills the room

MAVIS (CONTD)
Oh This is on Buddy’s mix

MATT
Slade made you a mix tape Maybe
he is going to cheat

Mavis sits on Matt’s bed miserable

MAVIS

He didn’t make it too recently
MATT

When
MAVIS

The ‘90s

Buddy packs a bowl and offers it to Mavis

MATT
(sarcastically)
So you party

MAVIS
Just pot When I was away at the
U my first year I tried acid
with some of my Theta sisters
(MORE)

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS (CONTD)
I ran into a gate and came this
close to fucking up my brand new
nose job That was it for me and
hard drugs

MATT
Your nose looks really different

MAVIS
It really doesn’t They just
refined the tip It’s not visible
to anyone who’s not a
professional um surgeon

Matt takes a huge hit

MATT
It’s visible

Mavis looks at Matt with pity

MAVIS
I’m not feeling great Maybe I’m
gonna go back to the Homeway
Suites and watch a video

MATT
No no You should stay There’s
no good “mom n’ pop” video here

anyway
Mavis sits up interested

MAVIS
What happened to Crocodile’s

MATT
The former site of Crocodile Rock
Video is now I believe a one-
hour dry cleaner’s The guy who
owned it--

MAVIS
(interrupting)
The fat black-haired guy

MATT
Yes he and his wife moved to the
Twin Cities And they took all the
inventory VHS Beta all the
laser discs-- I know because I
tried to buy some of it

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Once when I was 12 I tried to rent
that Susanna Hoffs movie The All
Nighter Susanna Hoffs you know
she was in the Bangles and I
worshipped her And that fat

guy

MATT
Victor

MAVIS
That fat guy he would not let me
have it because it was PG-13 and
it had “adult situations” I was
so pissed I made my mom call and
bitch them out

Mavis reaches for the bowl and takes a tiny hit

MATT
(knowing)
You were used to getting your way

Mavis’s laugh is brittle

MAVIS
I never get my way

MATT shrugs agreeing to disagree He smokes pot in
silence while Mavis braids the shag carpet Then

MATT
That guy Victor he’s dead now
He cannonballed off the Lowry
Avenue Bridge

MAVIS
How original
(off Matt’s look)
I mean because that’s like the
official suicide bridge It’s just
not a fresh idea I don’t know

Matt takes another hit not disagreeing

MAVIS (CONTD)
And now there’s just what a
regular video place Like a chain

MATT
Yes It’s all horrible Disney
Vault kiddie bullshit They don’t
even have a “back room”

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
I don’t watch that stuff

MATT
Well what do you watch when you
want to get off
Mavis wouldn’t normally answer such a question--
particularly from someone like Matt-- but for some
reason she does
MAVIS
High Fidelity
INT SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
MUSIC UP Something dreamy noisy guitar-driven slow
Mavis and Matt walk into the huge supermarket in slow
motion Their eyes are red Matt wears the kind of trench

coat favored by unpopular teenage boys

They walk up to a FREEZER CASE a veritable wall of
brightly packaged junk

So many choices Mavis opens the transparent freezer
door White vapor drifts out onto her face tickling her
closed eyes

Matt picks a box of Swanson’s chicken nuggets and a
Celeste Pizza for One

Mavis finally decides on a Lean Cuisine She slides it
under her arm and they head down the aisle to a checkout
lane

INT CAR - NIGHT

A quiet lamplit street lined with trees and clean
sidewalks Crickets chirp

Mavis drives slowly peering out the window Matt is in
the passenger seat His voice is stoner-hoarse

MATT
I think this is it

Mavis is chewing blue Bubble Yum Stoner gum

MAVIS
You think or you know

(CONTTNUED )
44

MATT
This is definitely his house He
drives a Jeep Liberty

MAVIS
That’s ironic Right Because he
has no freedom

It’s such a ridiculous overwrought thing to say but
Matt is so stoned he can’t help but giggle

MATT
You’re so fucked up

Mavis looks out at Buddy’s house in the darkness It’s
small ordinary But something about the single light
emanating from the kitchen feels like home Mavis is sad
Her voice becomes quiet and dreamy

MAVIS
Do you see that little light in
the kitchen

MATT

Yeah
MAVIS

Do you think someone’s awake
MATT

Maybe Maybe someone’s up with uh

that baby

Mavis blows a blue bubble with her gum surveilling the
house

MAVIS
The baby the baby

MATT
The problem that has no name

MAVIS
I wish they had those late-night
taco trucks here Or a Korean
truck even

MATT
Everyone here goes to bed at 9
Your hipster food on wheels would
go largely uneaten

MAVIS
Okay We can go now

(CONTTNUED )

Silence She looks at Matt expectantly as if she’s
forgotten she’s driving

MATT
(reminding her)
It’s all you

MAVIS
Okay

Mavis throws the car into gear and drives off

CUT TO

INT HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY (FANTASY) - DAY
MUSIC UP

Mavis wearing her school uniform peers at a heart-
shaped mirror in her locker She likes what she sees

Turning around she’s greeted by Buddy who wears a tie
and blazer There’s a football tucked under his arm
Mavis playfully takes the football from him and chucks it
down the hallway

Buddy leans in to kiss Mavis She reaches up and pulls a
CORD that dangles into the frame It’s randomly one of
those EMERGENCY BURN SHOWERS that you see in school
science labs Water pours down on her and BUDDY as a loud
scoreboard-style buzzer sounds

INT MOTEL ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

The light outside indicates dawn The digital clock reads
400 AM Mavis is curled up the bed fully dressed Her
back is to us

There’s a half-empty glass of BOURBON on the bed table
Mavis rolls over nearly crushing Baguette She groans
It’s impossible to tell if it’s a groan of pleasure or
annoyance

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - MORNING

Mavis enters bleary-eyed She takes the paper hygiene
guard off one of the drinking glasses fills it with tap
water and takes a long drink She looks awful

Mavis drives up to Mercury Fashion Square a mall that
has seen better days She sings a retro commercial to
herself

MAVIS
(singing)
Mercury Fashion Square You can
find great fashions there On 27th
and Highway 4

Mavis pulls into a parking spot (Those who are paying
close attention may notice that she’s in designated
“STORK PARKING” for expectant and new mothers only It’s
either an act of defiance or obliviousness )

INT MERCURY FASHION SQUARE - DAY

Mavis shops in the mall’s flagship department store It’s
not exactly Barney’s New York

Mavis flips through a rack of clothes A SALES LADY
conservative forties approaches her

SALES LADY

luck
SALES LADY

Is this something for work

MAVIS
No it’s for a special occasion
Not a formal occasion Something

bit edgy

SALES LADY
Okay We have some adorable new
dresses that just came in

MAVIS
Do you carry Marc Jacobs

SALES LADY
I don’t think we have that one

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Do you have Imitation of Christ

a chance we may reconnect

The sales lady smiles

SALESLADY
Get it girl You want to show him
what he’s been missing

MAVIS
He’s seen me recently so he
knows But this is the first time
his wife is seeing me

She doesn’t know what’s compelling her to say these
things But she’s saying them as candidly as if she were
in therapy

SALESLADY
Well It’s the end of my shift
and my son needs to be picked up
at school so I’m just going to
send over another associate Okay
She’s up on all the trends I’m
sure youll find something

wedges She looks good

EXT BUDDY’S HOUSE - DAY

Buddy’s house is a modest one-story with a large porch
An old car is parked in the driveway Everything is
solidly lower middle class

Buddy is on the porch with his wife BETH and their tiny
BABY He waves

Mavis walks up to the porch

BUDDY
What’s uuuuup

He subtly flashes fake gang signs

MAVIS
Hi

Beth rises and takes off her Wayfarers She’s a pretty
woman still carrying some baby weight around her breasts
and middle She has a kind smile and wears a rock T-shirt
with corduroys and Converse

BETH

(CONTTNUED )

Shrugging at her odd request Buddy gets up to fetch the
drinks

BUDDY

He heads into the house calling back at them

BUDDY (CONTD)

Mavis smiles at the baby uncomfortably Beth casually
lifts up her shirt to nurse

BETH
Pardon me We’re always eating
around here

MAVIS
I can see that

The baby roots and latches on to Beth’s breast Mavis
watches feeling uptight and pristine in her camisole

MAVIS (CONTD)
My sister is a lactation coach

BETH
(friendly)
Yeah That’s a neat job

The baby suckles noisily Beth gazes at her daughter
tenderly Mavis touches the baby’s head almost dutifully

MAVIS
She’s really cute

BETH
She’s like a clone of Buddy You

MAVIS

Beth leans over and calls to Buddy through the screen
door

BETH
Can you bring me a Summer Ale

Mavis looks taken aback Beth laughs

BETH (CONTD)
It’s fine I can just pump and
dump after the show Don’t worry

hammered

MAVIS
I know it just seemed funny

BETH
So how are you I know you’re a

shirts And boxers

BUDDY
Heh

Mavis pushes it a little further addressing Beth

MAVIS
I still have a few I think

Buddy looks uncomfortable but Beth smiles broadly
Mavis sees a strange CHART leaning against the wall It

shows cartoon faces with different expressions One says
“HAPPY” one says “SAD” and so on

MAVIS (CONT’D)
What’s that chart

BUDDY
Beth teaches special needs kids

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Ahhh

BETH
A lot of my kids learn emotions
cognitively It doesn’t come
naturally to them the way it does
for you or me So we need to show
them This is what happy looks
like This is what anxious looks
like And so on

Mavis is fascinated with the chart

MAVIS
How about like neutral What if
you don’t feel anything

BETH
That’s kind of how they are a lot
of the time so Yeah Don’t need
to teach it

Buddy changes the subject
BUDDY

Mavis seems to suddenly guiltily remember Baguette

MAVIS
Mm I do have a dog

BUDDY
Oh Nice

MAVIS
But he’s small he goes
everywhere with me Dogs are so
easy You can still have a life
you know

Beth is watching the baby fondly Her loving expression

negates everything Mavis is insinuating

(CONTTNUED )

Mavis takes a drink of ice water and looks longingly at
Buddy She crosses her long bare legs There’s a bead of
water on her lip which she wipes away

Buddy is beginning to sense something isn’t right

MAVIS (CONTD)
Beth when did you have this baby

BETH
Two weeks and two days

MAVIS
Well You’re really getting your
figure back

This is the last thing Beth cares about but she is

gracious

BETH
Thanks

Uncomfortable silence fills the room

INT DINNER TABLE - EVENING

The baby sleeps in a car seat contraption Buddy Mavis
and Beth eat burritos from Chipotle Buddy pats one of

the styrofoam take-out containers approvingly

BUDDY
Chipotle how ‘bout it

MAVIS
What happened to Hungry Howie’s
Isn’t that still your favorite

BETH
I don’t think we’ve ever ordered
from there have we honey

MAVIS
Well you are relatively new
around here Beth

BETH
(politely)
Um yeah I guess I’ve only been
here likenine years

BUDDY
Nine years yup

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Where are you originally from

anyway
Beth swallows and dabs her mouth with a napkin

BETH
Oh Close by actually I grew up
in East Duluth

MAVIS
You were rich

BETH
(taken aback)
We weren’t loaded My dad was a
podiatrist

MAVIS
My father’s a doctor too

BUDDY
Stepdad

If Mavis is annoyed by the correction she doesn’t let
on

MAVIS
(to Buddy)
No my biological father is also
in the medical field

BETH
Oh yeah Where does he practice

Buddy cringes knowing this is a sore subject
MAVIS
I don’t know Beth I’m afraid I

haven’t seen him in years

BETH
I’m sorry

MAVIS
Sorry for what

She pats Buddy’s arm
MAVIS (CONT’D)
Poor Buddy’s over here like Ahhhh

No it’s all right I’ve been
dealing with it forever

(CONTTNUED )

She looks at Buddy meaningfully

MAVIS (CONTD)
Buddy knows the whole story He
knows everything about me The
whole story of Mavis

BUDDY
That is true

Mavis takes a long satisfying gulp of water glancing at
Beth over the rim of the glass

The doorbell rings

BETH
(through a mouthful
of food)
Ooh Babysitter’s here

BUDDY
Rock and roll

Buddy springs up and bounds toward the door

MAVIS
(to Beth)
This is all very exciting Do you
need to get dressed for the show

BETH
I am dressed for the show

EXT CHAMPION O’ MALLEY’S - EVENING (TO ESTABLISH)

There’s a modest line of people outside the bar mostly
in their 30s and 40s

INT CHAMPION O’ MALLEY’S - SAME

We pan past a HOMEMADE FLYER advertising Beth’s band It
says “Nipple Confusion Moms That Rock” The four band
members are pictured in a grid Beatles-style

The band is tuning up on a tiny stage surrounded by brass
rails The lead singer MARY ELLEN TRANTOWSKI has
tattoos on her arms and a cool (for Duluth) haircut
There’s also a bass player a guitarist and of course
Beth She fusses with her drums tightening them up with
a key

(CONTTNUED )

MARY ELLEN
(into mic)
Testing Four-four three-three

Mavis and Buddy linger by the bar Mavis is drinking
Buddy’s brand of beer She hands a fresh bottle to Buddy

BUDDY
Oh Thanks Mavis

MAVIS
So are they any good

BUDDY
What

MAVIS

Are they good The band

Buddy seems a little looser than usual He finishes off
the beer

BUDDY
Totally Look Freehauf’s over
there

Sure enough Matt is leaning against an EMPLOYEES ONLY

doorway near the rear of the bar He watches the stage

passively his arms crossed over his belly Mavis tries
to not make eye contact

MAVIS
Ha God he’s always just lurking
around isn’t he So creepy

BUDDY
Matt’s been through a lot He’s a
good guy

MAVIS

Well he freaks me out Look at
his face He’s so doughy He looks
like a murderer

It’s a dumb mean comment but Buddy is amused

BUDDY
(chuckling)
You definitely are a writer
Mavis
MAVIS

See Now you’re laughing

(CONTTNUED )

BUDDY
Youve always been so funny

Mavis is thrilled with this moment of attention and
validation She leans in and opens her mouth to speak
Alas she’s quickly drowned out by the sound of Beth
doing an EXTREMELY LOUD SOUND CHECK on her drums

BANG BANG BANG BOOM BOOM BOOM

The sound guy gives Beth a thumbs-up from his console
Mavis is beyond irritated

MARY ELLEN
(onstage)
Hello Mercury

The small crowd cheers

MARY ELLEN (CONT’D)
I’m Mary Ellen Trantowski and we
are Nipple Confusion Please be
kind as this is only our second
show and we all have small
children at home

Friendly laughter from the crowd

MARY ELLEN (CONT’D)
This first one is a cover It was
originally recorded by Teenage
Fanclub in 1996 It was our
drummer Beth’s idea

She gestures to Beth who grins and waves a drum stick
and Buddy and Mavis’s direction Buddy leans toward Mavis
instructively and whispers

BUDDY
Beth loves this song

The song begins with a few loud strums and a familiar
couplet sung by Mary Beth

MARY ELLEN
(singing)
She wears denim wherever she
goes

Mavis’s face falls as she watches them play This is HER
song with Buddy The song from the mix tape

(CONTTNUED )

Beth pounds the drums with unschooled enthusiasm Even
though the band is technically sloppy everyone is
smiling and cheering

Mavis’s eyes fill up with tears Or is she just drunk
She looks around Up front a PROUD DAD holds a toddler
wearing LARGE PROTECTIVE HEADPHONES

Two KIDS about 7 and 9 dance in front of the stage The
women in the band-- even Beth who drums doggedly--
HARMONIZE TOGETHER on the chorus and not very well

MARY ELLEN and THE BAND
I didn’t want to hurt you oh
yeah

Mavis looks at Buddy He’s rocking out guzzling anouther
beer

Mavis glances at Matt Freehauf who’s still leaning
against the doorway Their eyes meet His gaze is full of
pity She hates that he pities her

EXT HIGH SCHOOL (FANTASY) - DAY

From Mavis’s POV we head toward a pair of double doors
Just outside the doors we see a group of gossiping GIRLS
wearing high-school uniforms Only they’re not girls
they’re BETH’S FRIENDS Mary Ellen glances at Mavis
through the glass with a sneer Mavis pushes through the
doors

ABRUPT CUT TO

EXT CHAMPION O’ MALLEY’S - NIGHT

Mavis opens the front door of the bar to exit It’s a
typical postshow scene albeit a little more family-
friendly The crowd spills out onto the sidewalk Friends
load BAND GEAR into someone’s van Beth and her bandmates
chat excitedly Beth is clearly having a blast Mavis and
Buddy linger on the periphery

BETH
(laughing)
I messed up the fill so bad on
“Haircut” I’m sorry guys

BASSIST
No honey you were great

Buddy’s voice is a loud drunken bray

(CONTTNUED )

BUDDY
Yeah you guys were namazing

MARY ELLEN
Did he just say “namazing”

The women titter at Buddy’s mistake

BETH
(affectionate)
I think someone’s had a
few too many

MAVIS
Oh hardly

BUDDY
Yup I’m pretty drunk Bethie we
gotta get home Relieve the
babysitter

He takes another swill of beer amid protests from Beth’s
rowdy mom-friends

BETH
Aw really I want to stay out
just a little while longer

GUITARIST
Yeah Buddy you can’t have her
back yet

Beth pouts cutely batting her lashes at Buddy

MAVIS
(suddenly )
I’1l1 drive him home

BETH
(eager)
Really
Mary Ellen gives Mavis the once-over Mavis notices the
coldness of her stare Beth may be oblivious but nothing
gets past Mary Ellen
MARY ELLEN
It’s interesting to see you
hanging around again Mavis

Mavis summons her best high-school bitch attitude

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
Mary Ellen you were great
tonight It’s inspiring to see a
single partnerless mother with so
much confidence onstage

BETH
(interrupting)
Buddy let Mavis drive you home
OK I’m gonna stay and celebrate

BUDDY
Sure Okay

Mavis takes the Jeep keys from Buddy She holds them up
and clicks the “unlock” button triumphantly

As the car BEEPS Mavis flashes her best shit-eating grin
at a scowling Mary Ellen

EXT BUDDYS HOUSE - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)

The Jeep pulls up Mavis and Buddy get out and walk up
onto the porch Buddy stumbles leaning on Mavis We hear
their voices in the night

MAVIS
Easy Bud

BUDDY
My tolerance has really gone down
since you knew me

MAVIS
What do you mean “since I knew
you”
EXT BUDDY’S HOUSE (PORCH) - NIGHT (TO ESTABLISH)

Buddy goes to enter the house but Mavis stops him

MAVIS
Hey wait

BUDDY
What

Mavis takes Buddy by the wrist and looks at his cheap
Timex watch To her it’s more beautiful than any Rolex
She pushes the “Indiglo” button illuminating the watch
and shows Buddy the time 1053

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
(whispering)
Look You still have seven
minutes Don’t you have that baby-
sitter until 11

BUDDY
Yeah But seven minutes is
nothing We can’t go anywhere

MAVIS
That’s true We can’t But time is
so precious

Buddy’s words are slurred

BUDDY
I know I know Mavis I’m
learning that from my little girl

This isn’t what Mavis wants to hear but it gives her a
new tactic

MAVIS
Youre a great father You’re
already going above and beyond in
so many ways Remember when we
were kids Dads didn’t have to do
shit They came and they went and
we still bought them new golf
balls and tie tacks on Father’s
Day But you-- you’ve really
stepped up to the plate You do
too much even

Now Buddy’s voice has become similarly low and intimate

BUDDY
Do you think so

MAVIS
Yes You’re such a good good man
Buddy Don’t ever shortchange
yourself

Buddy chuckles softly and drunkenly His hand has
wandered to Mavis’s bare arm It’s a friendly grip more
for balance than anything but there’s tension now

BUDDY
I justI really love my
daughter

Mavis hugs him

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
I know And that’s the only thing
that matters Not Beth not
anything--

Buddy and Mavis’s faces meet in a KISS It’s a hard close-
mouthed kiss but a kiss nonetheless

Buddy pulls away

BUDDY
Hey hey hey

The BABYSITTER an effeminate college-aged guy suddenly
opens the door and appears on the porch He holds a
pacifier in one hand and stares daggers at Mavis

BABYSITTER
(indignant)
I thought I saw lights

BUDDY
Yeah um Daniel I’m home
BABYSITTER
Where’s Beth
MAVIS
(exaggerating)
Beth wanted to stay out all night
and party
BABYSITTER

Well we’re all out of breastmilk
and she doesn’t want the nuk
anymore

He holds up the “nuk” a pacifier as if it’s tainted

BUDDY
I got it

Buddy heads into the house drunk and flustered not
turning to say goodbye to Mavis

MAVIS
Good night Buddy

BABYSITTER
(slamming door)
Good night

INT BLUE HILL BAR - EVENING

The transition is sudden but we can immediately see that
Mavis and Freehauf are drowning their sorrows again
Mavis is mid-rant

MAVIS

Freehauf is fiddling with the jukebox

MAVIS (CONT’D)
Hey Hey Matt know what I hate

MAVIS

drinking a beer and laughing with a group of friends

grin on his face

MATT (CONT’D)

Minnesota

(CONTTNUED )

He holds his arms outstretched Mavis leans in for a hug

MIKE (CONTD)

MAVIS (CONT’D)

MATT

MAVIS

MATT loudly clinks Mavis’s stationary glass

Mavis responds in a quieter way She puts her glass
against his and holds it there for a beat like a kiss
EXT PARK —- DAY

A little patch of lawn wood chips and modern play

equipment near a small lake in Mercury Kids cavort
nearby

(CONTTNUED )

The sun shines on Mavis’s beautiful hair She looks like
a shampoo commercial albeit with a hangover

She kneels and unzips Baguette’s tiny dog bag

MAVIS
(to passerby)
Dogs are okay here right

Baguette leaps out and runs as fast as his tiny legs will
allow It’s a Born Free moment as he flies across the
grass overjoyed to be out of the Homeway Suites and
finally getting some attention The park is fenced and
he’s good to go

Mavis watches him pleased She sits down on a bench and
unwraps one of those granola bars that’s marketed to
women She takes out her laptop and opens it

She opens pieceofshitword and begins typing

Ashby and Isabella had a bond that could not broken
This everyone knew However Isbella could not

could not could not
Mavis looks up up checking on the dog

MAVIS (CONTD)
Good Baguette Is this fun

It definitely is fun A MAN walks by and admires the
prancing dog

MAN
Someone looks happy to be out

Mavis’s mouth is full of granola bar

PHONE CALL

INT BUDDY’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - DAY

Close on Buddy leaning against the wall with a diet soda
in his hand He looks troubled

BUDDY
Hi how are you

Mavis seems to interpret this innocent query as something
more meaningful

MAVIS
I’m good I’m good What is it
Bud

BUDDY
Oh well I meant to ask you this
on Wednesday

He takes a deep breath tense

BUDDY (CONT’D)

I was just wondering well if

baby in a complicated sling Her expression is
unreadable

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Mavis is walking back from the park with Baguette in his
bag Her spirits are high

MAVIS
(to bag)
Maybe we’1ll go again tomorrow
What do you think
No response from the bag

MAVIS (CONT’D)
Good boy

There’s a SILVER LINCOLN SEDAN slowly cruising down the
street After a few beats we realize it’s tailing Mavis

Mavis doesn’t notice right away but eventually looks
over her shoulder The car’s halting pace is suspicious

Finally Mavis stops The car also stops

Mavis shades her eyes from the sun Finally Mavis
addresses the driver in an odd tone

MAVIS (CONT’D)
May I help you

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
You thought you could get away
with this

Mavis shrugs

WOMANS VOICE (0S) (CONTD)

Reveal HEDDA GARY an attractive older woman in her ‘50s
She squints up at her daughter from the drivers seat

INT HEDDA’S CAR - DAY

Baguette is sitting comfortably in Hedda’s lap

HEDDA
This isn’t a large town You must
have known we were bound to run
into each other

MAVIS
I wasn’t avoiding you I was
planning to call

HEDDA
You never come home and when you
do you hide from me and your dad
Curious behavior

MAVIS

HEDDA

HEDDA

HEDDA
It’s just for a little bit Don’t
argue with me while I’m driving I
still get very nervous

INT HEDDA AND DAVID’S HOUSE - DAY

Mavis walks into her childhood home already crushed by
the psychic weight of the exercise Hedda is carrying

Baguette

HEDDA
(shouting)
David Mavis is here of all
people

Mavis’s stepfather DAVID emerges from the back of the
house There’s something wild-eyed and unsettling about

him

DAVID
Mavis I can’t believe my eyes

MAVIS
Hi David

(CONTTNUED )

He rushes to Mavis and crushes her in a hug He lifts her
off the ground and she grunts with discomfort

DAVID
How about an Underdog

Hedda claps her hands with delight

HEDDA
The Mavey and Davey Show is back on
the air

MAVIS

(nervous laughter)
Limited engagement

David studies her

DAVID
Now you do not look well at all
Your figure looks lovely but you
look peaked

MAVIS
I’m an alcoholic

HEDDA
(to David)
Her hair looks incredible

DAVID
Let me check

He leans in as if to inspect it Mavis cringes David
reaches for a lock of Mavis’s hair and smells it Her
disgust is almost imperceptible but it’s there

DAVID (CONTD)
Yep Still smells like lilies

HEDDA
Always since she was little it’s
had that sweet smell Except when
you got skunked Mavis

DAVID
And I gave her my famous tomato
soup shampoo a la Dave Right in
the garage

Hedda clucks remembering

(CONTTNUED )

HEDDA
(to Mavis)
Boy you were a real beast that
day
MAVIS

I was 13 and in my underwear and
my stepfather was pouring soup on
my head My new stepfather Even
while I was screaming and begging
him not too

She directs this at Hedda not David

HEDDA
Let me see what we have in the
kitchen There’s some white
wine

MAVIS
I want you guys to know up front
that I can’t stay long I’m ona
deadline

DAVID
We’re busy too honey

HEDDA
I’m painting the sun porch

DAVID
Just the trim

HEDDA
It’s important for women my age to
do weight-bearing exercise

MAVIS
How is that weight-bearing

HEDDA
Oh You won’t believe who I saw
the other day

DAVID
(interjecting)
Buddy your former beau

HEDDA
Oh let me for once
(to Mavis)
He has a little one now

(CONTTNUED )

She seems to delight in revealing this information

knowing it will bother Mavis

MAVIS
I know I’ve know for ages We’re
still quite close

HEDDA
You must be jealous as hell

Davis chuckles

DAVID
We know you

Hedda taps Mavis playfully but firmly

HEDDA
You can’t hide from us Pee Pee
We’re you’re permanent best
friends

DAVID
We know you better than anyone

MAVIS
I’m not jealous at all Buddy is
one of my favorite people I’ve
ever known He’s very dear to me
And the baby is part of him so--
I love it too

HEDDA
Oh it doesn’t work that way

DAVID
Not at all

HEDDA
You wish your kids were a part of
you But they never are Never
They’re more like little parasitic
worms They cling to you and then
they inherit the worst of you

DAVID
(to Mavis)
Well you have the best of your
mother’s looks that’s for sure

HEDDA
I think Buddy will be a very good
father

(MORE )

(CONTTNUED )

HEDDA (CONTD)
He always took care of you when
you were melting down Which was--
always

She laughs
DAVID
(mock-whispering)

Or once a month

MAVIS
May I be excused for a moment

David has seized Baguette and is holding him high in the
air

DAVID

Turn on the fan when you’re done
HEDDA

See if you like my new reed

diffuser

INT HEDDA AND DAVID’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - DAY

Mavis creeps upstairs and peeks into her old bedroom
It’s the bedroom of a popular girl from the ‘90s-- which
seems pretty sad and faded now Her bulletin board
covered in blue ribbons and certificates still hangs
over the desk There’s a diploma from the University of
Minnesota and some Kappa Alpha Theta stuff

We see a framed class photo of Mavis with HUGE BANGS
sitting in the corner Teenage Mavis has a smile so huge
it’s almost a grimace

There’s a class graduation photo on the wall one of
those giant long-format ones with everyone’s head shot
Mavis walks over to it and scans the names No sign of
Matt

In small type at the bottom of the picture it says
Photos not available Yun Ng Matthew Freehauf

Mavis opens the closet From a pile of old clothes she
retrieves a RED SWEATSHIRT and unfolds it eagerly We
can’t see what’s on the front of it

INT HEDDA AND DAVID’S HOUSE (HALLWAY) - DAY

Mavis exits the room In the hallway there’s a large
WEDDING PICTURE in a silver frame

(CONTTNUED )

Mavis in a chic white dress cuddled up to ALLEN an
average-looking man who seems thrilled to be wedded to
her

Allen brandishes a silver CAKE SERVER as if it’s a
weapon This gesture seems to annoy the bride who
glances sidelong at him even as she smiles

INT HEDDA AND DAVID’S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - SAME

Mavis emerges downstairs stuffing the red sweatshirt
into Baguette’s bag

MAVIS
Can you take down that wedding
picture of me and Allen

Hedda is washing some greens in a colander

HEDDA
What

MAVIS
Can you take down my wedding
picture

HEDDA

Just because you got a divorce
doesn’t mean that we can’t enjoy
the memory of Allen

MAVIS
Allen’s still alive

HEDDA
Have you talked to that little
nephew of his lately Perseus or
Sophocles or

MAVIS
Why would I keep in touch with
Allen’s nephew

HEDDA
Because you were close and it
would be a nice thing to do

Mavis says nothing

HEDDA (CONTD)
You shouldn’t have married him if
you didn’t want to form lasting
relationships
(beart)

(MORE)
(CONTTNUED )

HEDDA (CONTD)
I always suspected you married him
because just “someone else” got
married

MAVIS
And I’ve told you a million times
you’re wrong

Hedda reaches to smooth Mavis hair Her hand wanders
instinctively underneath near Mavis’s ear She feels the
bald patch and reacts

HEDDA
Now what is this Are we doing
this again

Mavis jerks away David walks in with a basket of small
tan eggs

DAVID
I hope you’re staying for dinner
Freshly laid brown bantam eggs

HEDDA
Omelettes and a nice fresh
green salad

She smiles pleased with herself

DAVID
(to Mavis)
I didn’t get that henhouse permit
for nothing

Mavis looks sick

Hedda heats up a skillet with some butter She shows
Mavis the “Plugra” label proudly

HEDDA
(proudly)
Plugra I got this at Anderley’s
This is the best butter there is
The absolute best

MAVIS
I believe you

HEDDA
They use this on the Food Network

David reaches out and cracks the first of the eggs into
the skillet What comes out is definitely NOT OKAY It’s
a bloody mess

(CONTTNUED )

Mavis SCREAMS stumbling away from the stove

HEDDA (CONTD)
Uh-oh

DAVID
Jesus Mavis it’s just a bad one

MAVIS
Get it away Get it away

DAVID
You’re ridiculous Did you grow up
getting all your food at the
supermarket

MAVIS
(shrieking)
Yes you stupid asshole I did

DAVID
(to Hedda)
I can’t take the screaming I
can’t You ask me what I mean when
I talk about the screaming and
this is it Hedda

Mavis buries her face in an embroidered hand towel She
makes a guttural animal sound

MAVIS
All right let’s not get silly
EXT MATT’S HOUSE - EVENING
Hedda’s car pulls up to the house Matt is outside
smoking He barely blinks at the sight of Mavis’s
arrival

INT HEDDA’S CAR - SAME

HEDDA
This is where you’re staying
MAVIS
(hurried)
Yes Thanks for the ride

Hedda scrutinizes the semi-dilapidated house (and the
semi-dilapidated man smoking in front of it)

(CONTTNUED )

HEDDA
Well that’s different

Mavis gathers her purse and gives her mother a

perfunctory kiss on the cheek
HEDDA (CONTD)
I suppose this neighborhood is
getting very young
MAVIS

‘Bye Mom Ill call

HEDDA
Go ahead lie to me
She offers Mavis her cheek for a kiss Mavis obliges

HEDDA (CONT’D)

(fondly)
Peepers Be well
Mavis gets out of the car Hedda drives away Matt stubs

out his cigarette
MAVIS
That was my mother I would prefer

if she didn’t know where I’m

staying
Matt nods
MAVIS (CONTD)
(serious)
You don’t know what she’s
capable of
MATT

I understand

Mavis stands there on the sidewalk emotionally
exhausted Matt smiles naturally intuiting her pain
Mavis smiles back weary
MAVIS
Wanna go smoke in the woods or

something

Matt stands up with effort
MATT

You holding

MAVIS
(as if)

MATT
I got some

Matt reaches for his crutch and moves gingerly down the
hill toward Mavis

EXT WOODS BEHIND THE SCHOOL - NIGHT

Mercury High is lit up like a brick prison Past the
football and soccer fields there’s a small wooded area
Mavis and Matt trek through the overgrowth

Mavis shivers in her tank top She reaches into her purse
and takes out the RED SWEATSHIRT she found at her
parent’s house She pulls it on It’s a traditional high
school PE shirt On the front label there’s a large
surname written in Magic Marker SLADE

Buddy glances at the shirt but doesn’t say anything

MAVIS
Our school is so ugly It looks
just like a factory

MATT
It used to be a rubber fabrication
plant in the ‘20s

MAVIS
You know everything

Mavis takes a swig from a flask She touches a tree trunk
fondly

MAVIS (CONTD)
These woods were like fuck city
back in the day I remember being
out here with a few different
guys Naturally none of them knew
what they were doing but I

MATT
(interrupting)
I didn’t know you were a slut

MAVIS
I wasn’t
(cruelly)
I was normal

(CONTTNUED )

MATT
I haven’t been to this place
since then

Mavis rests comfortably against a tree still indulging
in high school sex memories

MAVIS
Me neither And I don’t
particularly miss those days If I
want someone to touch my pussy the
wrong way I’1ll just call my ex-
husband

MATT
This is where I got hurt

Mavis doesn’t know what to say

MAVIS

Ah I did know that I think
MATT

No you didn’t
MAVIS

I knew it was somewhere around

here

(awkward)

I’m sorry Is this triggering

MATT
No it’s okay
(beat)
Looks different here anyway I
think they cleared away a lot of
it when they built that new
science building

MAVIS
What was it like when those guys
were beating you I mean do you
mind my asking Did you say
something to set them off

MATT
You want all the dirt huh
MAVIS
Oh please it’s so old I’m just
curious
(MORE)

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS (CONTD)

I mean I’m with you every day--
for whatever reason-- and you have
your gimp stick and that you get
the migraines and all that so I’m
curious What is it like to get
beaten like that

MATT
I don’t really think about it much
anymore Mavis I’m a pretty
positive guy Not everyone wallows
in pain like you do You
practically jerk off to your
life’s worst moments

Mavis flinches as if physically injured

MAVIS
I don’t jerk off to anything How
dare you Oh my God Matt that’s
so insensitive You don’t know
what I’ve overcome

MATT
The heartbreak of split-ends

MAVIS
Why are you being an asshole all
of a sudden

MATT
I might as well catch up You’ve
had a 20-year head start

MAVIS
I think it’s time for me to go
home to Minneapolis I want to go
back to the city I don’t know why
I’m here I don’t know how I got
involved with a married man

MATT
You’re not involved with him
Jesus It’s sad

MAVIS
(sarcastic)

Oh yeah Matt devout husbands and
fathers go to bars alone with
their ex-girlfriends all the time
They call them privately to invite
them to things They make out with
them on the porch

(CONTTNUED )

MATT
He didn’t make out with you I bet
my oma kisses me harder than that
at Christmas

MAVIS
You weren’t there It was really
intense and passionate
(pointing)
This is his shirt

The giant SLADE on the front of the shirt could not be
more obvious

MATT
Yes I noticed And FYI you look
completely insane wearing it
Look I don’t know what he’s doing
with you or what you think he’s
doing with you but I do know that
whatever it is it’s not cool and
it’s your fault And you’re shitty
for wanting it Also and I just
want to get this out in the open
Buddy Slade is a moron

MAVIS
Well you’re hardly perfect Matt
All you care about is that some
kids jumped you 20 years ago You
lean on that crutch and you lean
on people and you and I both know
that you’ve used the whole thing
as an excuse to be a failure

MATT
You don’t know anything about what
happened to me Those jocks you
used to put out for-- they
shattered my legs they bashed in
my skull they mangled my junk so
I have to piss and cum sideways
for the rest of my life and they
left me for dead Things aren’t so
great “down south” I can barely
have fuck myself let alone
another person

MAVIS
You can get past that You have to
move on

(CONTTNUED )

MATT

This coming from someone who’s
still trying to get a retake on
her senior photo

(beat)
Stop seeing Buddy With his wife
without his wife doesn’t matter
Stop seeing him in your mind Just
stop It’s wrong

MAVIS
You could care less about right or
wrong You’re just jealous because
as it turns out he might actually
want to be with me

Matt laughs angrily

MATT
Getting a guy hot for you is not
some blue ribbon accomplishment
Big deal You’re pretty And
skinny And frankly it’s not real
unusual for a bored middle aged
guy to be flirt with a blonde
bitch You’re a generic fantasy
You’re just a frame in the
highlight reel

Mavis’s voice is quieter than usual

MAVIS
Let’s get out of here

MATT
You’re not his soul mate Beth is

Mavis is walking toward the street She turns to him with
a false not of compassion in her voice

MAVIS
It’s really a shame that you’re
like this If you had a good
personality none of the other
stuff would matter to people

MATT
Right no one would care about my
broken body Sure people see past
that shit every day Hey why
don’t you use my crutch as a
metaphor again That was really
masterful

(MORE )

(CONTTNUED )

MATT (CONTD)
You should put that in one of your
little teenage stories God knows
you don’t know anything about
being an adult

MAVIS
There’s a reason why you and I
can’t be real friends

MATT

Because you’re crazy You haven’t
changed at all I bet you still
have an “ugly best friend” who
makes you feel better about
yourself Right

(calling after her)
I bet you still flirt with any man
who will give you the validation
you so desperately crave

Mavis walks away huddled in her sweatshirt She refuses
to show emotion

Matt leans against a tree tired from standing and
watches her disappear

Her high heels clack against the dirty linoleum

She approaches a display of beribboned BURP CLOTHS and
looks at them A YOUNG DAD is shopping nearby He’s
fairly paunchy and average-looking but he and Mavis
exchange smiles

Mavis postures expertly being cute with him Her stance

is pigeon-toed her smile is radiant She’s an incredible
flirt Dad is enchanted

Mavis’s smile lasts a beat too long and Dad’s begins to

fade imperceptibly

AGED MANAGER in an employee polo takes inventory nearby

MAVIS
(to associate)

Do you have the Waverley Prep
books

ASSOCIATE
Yeah they’ve got their own
display table over there

He points to a table heaped with the pastel spines of
various Waverley Prep titles

MAVIS
(pleased)
Wow They must be really popular

ASSOCIATE
Actually we just have a lot of
surplus stock we’re trying to
clear out They were a big thing a
couple of years ago but now
they’re ending the series

MAVIS
Oh I doubt that

ASSOCIATE
Nope it’s true We got a letter
from the publisher And the
computer says “Do Not Shelve”
SO

Mavis walks over to the table She sifts through the
books until she finds one of her own Don’t Count on It
The cover art depicts two attractive teenage girls facing
each other in a confrontation

The subtitle reads What Isabella wants Isabella gets
Below that the name JANE MACMURRAY in prominent type

Mavis clears her throat
MAVIS

(to associate)
May I borrow your pen

(CONTTNUED )

The associate obliges Mavis opens the book to the
flyleaf and begins to write in an unsubtle way The
associate notices

ASSOCIATE
Are you writing in there

MAVIS
I’m the author I’m signing it

The associate still looks concerned that his merchandise
is being vandalized

MAVIS (CONTD)
(offended )
I’m buying it don’t worry

ASSOCIATE
Youre Jane MacMurray

MAVIS
No Jane MacMurray created the
series but I wrote the book I’m

She points to the flyleaf which does indeed read “Story
by Jane MacMurray Written by Mavis Gary-Crane”

ASSOCIATE
Do you know Jane MacMurray
MAVIS
I know her very well
(indignant)

I wrote this book

ASSOCIATE
Okay Wow

Mavis turns her attention back to the book With a
shaking impatient hand she writes

Dear Kendra Please enjoy this book I hope you read
other things as well because one cannot live on Waverley
Prep alone Believe me if this kind of shit is all that
matters to you youre going to have problems in life -
) xoxo Best wishes Mavis Gary (Crane)

She signs her name with a flourish and hands the pen back
to the associate

MAVIS
Would you like a signed copy for
the store

(CONTTNUED )

ASSOCIATE
No that’s fine

Mavis grabs another book wielding her pen threateningly

MAVIS
I’‘1l sign as many as you want It
adds value to your stock

ASSOCIATE
Yeah but when merchandise is
signed we can’t send it back to
the publisher

MAVIS
Why would you send these back to
the publisher

ASSOCIATE
Wullwe’re probably not going to
sell them The series is done
Hey

Mavis is rapidly manically signing another book making
her signature as big as possible She reaches for
another As the associate moves toward her she slams it
shut backing away from the table

MAVIS
Okay Fine

INTEXT BUDDY’S HOUSE - DAY

Mavis stands on the porch holding a baby gift in a
decorative bag She rings the doorbell

Buddy’s mother JAN answers She’s in her 60’s and has
basically let herself go Her voice is as coarse as her
short hair

MAVIS
Hi Jan

JAN
Well It’s been a very long time
since I’ve seen you

MAVIS
I’ve been a busy lady

(CONTTNUED )

JAN
So I hear Buddy’s been very busy
ha ha And Bethie I’m finally a
grandma

MAVIS
I’m so glad for you

Buddy intercepts at just the right moment

BUDDY
Hey there

He reaches for Mavis who hugs him enthusiastically Mid-
hug Mavis looks at Jan over Buddy’s shoulder It’s an
aggressive pointed stare Jan stares back

MAVIS
I brought a present

She offers the gift bag awkwardly

MAVIS (CONT’D)
They’re just um burp cloths

BUDDY
Great we always need more pukers
Ha ha
JAN
(interjecting)

But it’s alll111 worth it

BUDDY
Hey Mom I think Beth needs help
with the endive thing

JAN
Grandma to the rescue

Jan scurries off to the kitchen The small house is
crowded with friends and relatives People are spilling
out into the yard

DANIEL the suspicious babysitter from the other night
is socializing across the room He sees Mavis and gives
her the stink eye She returns the look with her best
Pretty Girl Death Stare

Mavis turns her attention back to Buddy smiling She

reaches into her purse and hands the Waverley Prep book
to Buddy

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS
(to Buddy)
Here’s that book For Kendra Your

niece
Buddy is grateful but he barely glances at the book

BUDDY
Hey thanks She’s not here but
I’1l send it to her

Mavis gazes at Buddy savoring this rare moment of “alone
time” even surrounded by chaos

MAVIS
There’s a character in this one
that I based on you

BUDDY
(distracted)
Hm

MAVIS
In the book I mean I named him
Ashby but it’s so blatantly you
When you read it it’ll be
obvious

BUDDY
I hope he’s cool

Mavis laughs nervously

MAVIS
Were not even supposed to do
that We’re supposed to stick to
this character bible But I
managed to slip it through I had
some things I wanted to say to you
so I thought I would use the
book to--

Mavis realizes Buddy is totally distracted He’s grabbed
a LITTLE BOY and has turned the shrieking child upside-
down The boy’s giggles drown out Mavis

BUDDY
(playful)
Get outta here Carter-bug

He releases the boy and smiles at Mavis You were saying

MAVIS
You must be overwhelmed Buddy

(CONTTNUED )

BUDDY
Because of the party

MAVIS
Because of all of it

BUDDY
(not getting it)
Yeah Yeah totally It overwhelms
me every day how happy I am

MAVIS
But youre not

BUDDY
What

Jan re-enters holding the BABY

JAN
Look who’s up

People immediately crowd around the baby

BUDDY
Hi sweet pea

He tenderly takes the baby from Jan delighting the
assembled relatives Everyone loves a daddy with his baby
girl

Mavis watches the “show” as women coo over Buddy’s
paternal stylings She tries to smile but there’s
unmistakable scorn in her eyes

Mavis wanders away toward a folding table that’s been set
up as a makeshift bar in the overcrowded room She pours
herself a shot of Jim Beam checks to see if anyones
looking and downs it

Swallow Repeat

In the background a musical infant toy begins playing
“Yankee Doodle” Jan sings along with it loudly and
tunelessly

JAN
(singing)
Yankee Doodle came to town riding
Macaroni You’re my special baby
girl you’re a special baby
Hooray

EXT BUDDY’S YARD - DAY

Mavis moves through the yard now clutching a fruity
drink that’s nearly gone She’s stumbling a little
drinking too fast

Everything looks grotesque All these pale simple
people their potato salad and their punchMavis is
sick

Mary Ellen and some other moms are hanging out near the
food Mary Ellen sees Mavis and murmurs something to the
clique They LAUGH doing a crappy job of disguising
their disdain

Buddy calls for people’s attention

BUDDY
Hey listen up everyone

Everyone obliges

BUDDY (CONTD)
I have a little surprise for
everyone so if you’1ll just direct
your attention to the garage in a
few minutes

Buddy races off mysteriously Buddy’s mother turns
proudly to a matronly FRIEND of hers and begins dishing
quietly The whole conversation is barely audible

JAN
It’s a “push present” Have you
heard of this It’s a new thing
apparently

FRIEND
Push

JAN
You know because she pushed out
the little one

Jan does a comical little squat to demonstrate

FRIEND
Ahhhh That’s different

The word “different” has a special connotation in
Minnesota

(CONTTNUED )

But Mavis isn’t paying attention to this conversation
She wanders in a daze Her hands are shaking as she
reaches for a cigarette

BETH
Mavis Are you okay

MAVIS
I would be if I could get a drink

BETH
There’s some right here

She reaches for a PITCHER OF PUNCH but is temporarily
distracted by an OLDER RELATIVE

BETH (CONTD)
What Oh no she’s fine with
Grandpa right now Thank you
Uncle Bob

She turns back toward Mavis and accidentally BUMPS
against a party guest Most of the punch SPLASHES onto
the front of Mavis’s minidress

Beth (CONTD)
(stammering)
Oh I’1l get something

MAVIS
Oh my God Oh my God Fuck you
Fuck you

Beth backs off blinking The edge on Mavis’s voice grabs
people’s attention Conversation stops

Mavis laughs

MAVIS (CONTD)
I’m just joking Beth God you
should see your face You’re just
standing there like a big lump

Beth’s confused half-smile fades
MAVIS (CONTD)
No just kidding For real I love

your jersey

She tugs on the sleeve of Beth’s loose-fitting square-
shaped dress It does look a bit like a football jersey

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS (CONTD)
(chanting softly)
Let’s go Injuns let’s go
(clap clap)

Beth reminds patient

BETH
I’1ll go get a rag

MAVIS
You guys sure have a lot of rags
around here Burp cloths
whatever Hey use some’a mine
that I just bought you

Everyone is staring at Mavis

MAVIS (CONTD)

The funny thing is I actually
could have had this party a long
time ago I mean this very same
party Buddy and I were together
for four years

(nodding toward Jan)
Jan knows

Jan looks away already mortified

MAVIS (CONT’D)
Remember We were inseparable
in more ways than one Ooh I’m
sorry Jan Kirk
Buddy got me pregnant

A few embarrassed gasps from the crowd Beth appears
proffering a rag

BETH
(quietly)
You want to clean up Mavis

MAVIS
No don’t worry It’s linen It’s
fucked

Beth gently and discreetly tries to towel off Mavis but
Mavis resists pushing her away

MAVIS (CONTD)
(loudly)
Wait I’m telling a story Buddy
got me pregnant when I was 20
when we were almost broken up

(MORE)
(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS (CONTD)
And I decided to keep it are you
hearing this We were going to
keep the baby like this-- we were
going to have a baby and a naming
party and a Funquarium and little
fruit hats and all that And nine
weeks in I had well I had
Buddy’s miscarriage which I
wouldn’t wish for-- to happen to
anyone Even if they totally
deserved it

Shocked silence Beth looks like she wants to die

MAVIS (CONTD)
Maybe if things had been a little
bit more hospitable you know
down south in my broken body
Buddy and I would be here right
now With a teenager and probably
even more kids We always came
back to each other Always Didn’t
we Jan

The GARAGE DOOR opens noisily Reveal Buddy’s legs then
Buddy’s entire body then Buddy’s smiling face

He stands expectantly next to a BRAND NEW DRUM KIT
There’s a jaunty BOW tied to the ride cymbal

Nobody says a word
BUDDY
You guys it’s a new drum kit for

Beth

An ELDERLY MAN claps dutifully A few people join in but
most people are still whispering

Buddy hits the CRASH CYMBAL for emphasis confused

Beth has tears in her eyes but manages to croak out a
response

Beth
Thank you honey

BUDDY
What’s wrong

Beth can barely speak

Beth
Nothing

(CONTTNUED )

Mavis is laughing

MAVIS
What do you mean nothing What’s
wrong with you Are you one of
those kids who needs a chart to
learn feelings Why are you
covering for me Stand up for
yourself Beth

JAN
That’s enough Mavis You’re drunk
as a skunk

Beth
Mom it’s okay

Beth moves closer to Mavis putting her hand on Mavis’s
back

MAVIS
I’ve been drunk the whole time
I’ve been back and nobody gave a
fuck until
(indicating Beth)
this one got bent out of shape

She stumbles away from Beth Buddy charges forward and
herds her over to the fence trying to move her away from
the crowd

BUDDY
(hushed)
What the hell are you doing My
wife invited you here You
wouldn’t be here otherwise

MAVIS
You invited me Buddy

BUDDY
Beth practically forced me to call
you I mean she even stood there
and supervised to make sure I’d do
it She feels sorry for you Ive
been trying to blow you off the
whole time you’ve been in town
but Beth is a really good person
you know And it’s obvious you’ve
been having somemental uh
sickness some depression and
you’re very lonely and confused

(MORE )

(CONTTNUED )

BUDDY (CONTD)
So she made me invite you even
though I knew it would be a
mistake I knew it

Beth has joined Buddy by his side Her face is creased
with worry

MAVIS
(to Buddy)
You’re lying

Beth’s voice is low and sad

BETH
He’s not

Mavis looks at Beth’s face Her eyes are full of pity and
concern Still sympathetic

MAVIS
What about now Do you hate me
now I hate you so it should be
easy What the fuck is wrong
with you people

Mavis tries to stagger out of the yard but accidentally
misses the gate

BUDDY
Mavis

MAVIS
(departing)
I came back for you For you And
I hate this town It’s a hick lake
town that smells like fish shit I
just want you to know that

Mavis leaves Someone hands Beth the baby Beth holds her
daughter close
INTEXT MATT’S HOUSE - DUSK

The doorbell chimes Matt limps to the door Sandra
watches America’s Funniest Home Videos in the background

Matt opens the door to reveal Mavis weeping
hysterically Her dress is covered in punch and she’s
practically incoherent

MAVIS

I screwed up so bad I screwed up
so bad

(CONTTNUED )

Matt folds Mavis into his arms Her hair is in her face
As she weeps she pushes it away then PULLS viciously at
it her fingers scrambling compuslively over the bare
pink spot behind her ear

MATT
Don’t do that

Sandra is watching dumbstruck from her beanbag chair
She’s horrified by the sight of her idolnemesis ripping
at that perfect blonde hair

SANDRA
Stop STOP I love your hair It’s
so beautiful

This is the most emotion Sandra has shown in years

MATT
I got it Sandra

He grabs Mavis by her arms and guides her to his room as
she sobs violently

Mavis throws herself on Matt He loses his balance and
falls onto the bed

MATT (CONT’D)
Youre scaring me

Mavis weeps sniffling into Matt’s T-shirt

MAVIS
I’m crazy And no one loves me

MATT
Youre very lovable

MAVIS
You don’t love me

MATT
Guys like me are born
automatically loving women like
you We spend the rest of our
lives in reverse trying to make
it stop

MAVIS
I went to Buddy’s house

MATT
What happened

(CONTTNUED )

Mavis starts weeping again Her eyes are a mess She bats
ineffectually at her face with a mascara-smeared hand

MATT (CONTD)
What happened

MAVIS
My dress is ruined

She reaches down and PULLS OFF her stained dress in one
rapid gesture She’s not wearing a bra just cotton
underwear Matt shrinks away

MATT
Let me get you a shirt

Mavis kneels there staring at him not trying to cover
herself up She sniffles

MAVIS
I want your shirt

Matt looks down at his Hanes Beefy Tee

MATT
I don’t know if athletic grey is
your color

Mavis looks at him shirtless and helpless Shaking Matt
removes his shirt and hands it to Mavis

Mavis holds the shirt against her body for a moment then
lays it aside

Matt is not the type of guy who feels comfortable without
a shirt His arms are crossed

MAVIS
You hide me

She reaches for Matt He can’t help but reach back
partially to embrace her but also so they both feel less
naked They hug tightly obscuring each other’s bare
chests

It’s Matt surprisingly who tips Mavis down onto her
back He buries his face into her hair

From underneath Mavis helps Matt take off his pants She
pulls off his underwear exposing him completely Her own
underwear are so small they barely count

Neither of them are really moving but Matt’s in between
her legs

(CONTTNUED )

They start to rock back and forth Mavis’s hands rake
Matt’s back and bare ass as if they were making love

CUT TO

INT MATT’S HOUSE (BEDROOM) - LATER

Silence Room tone Matt and Mavis are under the covers
now lying next to each other

Matt’s voice comes out in a stunned croak

MATT
Beth’s band is terrible

Mavis shrinks at the mention of Beth

MAVIS
What

MATT
You heard me Ter-ee-blay

Mavis ponders this quietly Then

MAVIS
But they’re all mothers Everyone
thinks it’s so admirable

MATT
I suppose it’s admirable to make
time for art But from a technical
perspective they’re absolutely
wretched

A moment of silence Then Matt leans in as if telling
Mavis an important secret

MATT (CONTD)
I would even say they’re the worst
band I’ve ever seen

MAVIS
Really
(long beat)
In what way
MATT

Well You know I work at
Champion’s so I see a lot of
really bad local acts come
through

(MORE )

(CONTTNUED )

MATT (CONTD)

Like a Blues Traveler cover band
except they guy couldn’t play the
harmonica So they had a kazoo

(chuckling)

And you know lots of teenagers

who can’t even tune their

instruments properly Hairy chicks
who can’t sing All kinds of
untalented people But Beth’s
band they’re the musical nadir

The worst For sure

MAVIS
I hate that Mary Ellen girl

MATT

I think she has an ED She came
in once and ordered three buffalo
wings and asked me how many

points they were

MAVIS
HA I knew she was starving

herself She was a parade float in

high school

MATT

Anyway I just wanted you to know

MAVIS
Okay

She plays it casual but she’s smiling in the darkness

Matt waits a few moments but he has a question he can’t

keep to himself

MATT
Why Buddy

Mavis’s responds in a sleepy whisper

MAVIS
He’s a good man He’s kind

MATT
Are other guys unkind

Mavis’s voice breaks

MAVIS
Sometimes

Matt listens

(CONTTNUED )

MAVIS (CONT’D)
He knew me when I was at my best

MATT
You weren’t your best then Mavis
I saw you every day You had this
little mirror in your locker It
was shaped like a heart and you
looked at that mirror more than
you ever looked at me And I was
at my best

Mavis reaches over and puts her hand on Matt’s face She
looks at him for a long time widening her eyes
exaggeratedly Staring

They’re nose to nose Mavis sniffles but Matt doesn’t
pull away

Mavis creeps downstairs

Sandra is standing in the kitchen washing dishes before
work She wears nurse’s scrubs and the sides of her
permed hair are slicked back into a dated half-ponytail

look A coffee pot percolates on the counter

Sandra turns around and sees Mavis Sandra’s face is bare
and homely A morning face on a non-morning person

MAVIS
Good morning

SANDRA
Hi

MAVIS

Sandra nods Mavis walks into the kitchen and takes two
mugs off the counter

Mavis walks to the refrigerator She pours some milk into
Sandra’s cup

MAVIS
Tell me when

SANDRA

Mavis leans against the counter regarding Sandra

MAVIS
How are you

Sandra doesn’t know what to say

MAVIS (CONT’D)
Tell me about yourself

SANDRA

MAVIS
That’s great

INT MAVIS’S CAR - LATER THAT DAY

The car leaves the rolling hills of Northern Minnesota
behind as we enter the congested Twin Cities area
INT MINNEAPOLIS - DUSK

A downtown bridge spanning the Mississippi River A

scenic overlook Mavis sits behind the wheel
expressionless

(CONTTNUED )

Mavis gets out of the car and looks out at the river The
overlook is precarious and she skids on the incline

She stops and returns to the car for a moment She climbs
into the drivers’ seat and pops in Buddy’s MIX CD

Music pours over her as she closes her eyes tightly
sinking into the seat

EXT GRADUATION CEREMONY (FANTASY) - SUNSET
Ambient CHEERING and crowd noises

It’s a lavish graduation ceremony at the fantasy school
Our blonde STUDENT-- Mavis-- wears a blue graduation cap
and gown She’s accessorised with a tiny gold pin that
says HARVARD

She turns to a friend mouths “I’m outta here” with an
arch of her eyebrow and heads up to the front of the
room with queen-bee confidence

As she walks up to fetch her diploma she smiles like a
supermodel The crowd goes wild with appreciation

Diploma in hand she reaches up and flicks the cap’s
golden tassel from the left side to the right in the
signature rite of passage

The cheers from the audience grow stronger She gazes out
at the crowd We don’t recognize anyone until

Buddy appears in the front row He stands up proudly his
arms filled with flowers Her face lights up as she
recognizes him He’s always in her dreams never not
there

The applause grows and grows and cuts out suddenly

THE END
