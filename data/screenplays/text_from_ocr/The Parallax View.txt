THE PARALLAX VIEW

ExT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Its RAINING hard We look out through the wet side window
of a car parked om an overpass above a long flat straight
HEADLIGHTS of another car come toward us down the highway
from total darkness refracted by the trickling rain on the
window into a parallactic double image Theres a BANG like
a tire blowing The lights swerve and skid with a brief
staggering CRASH of steel and glass pile head-on at 75mph
into cement abutment of the overpass Then SILENCE settles
again and OVER THE PICTURE these words appear

MANS IMAGE IS NOT ONLY THAT OF
GOD IT IS ALSO THAT OF SATAN
THE IMAGE IN THE ASCENDANT NOW
CANNOT BE KNOWN TO US PERHAPS
GODS IS NOT THE TRIUMPH IN OUR
TIME -

-From The Handbook For
Employees the Bureau

EXT BLACKTOP ROAD - DAY -

A STATE POLICE CAR pursues a sedan at speed siren and
flashers going Around a curve with tires screaming then
the sedan brakes abruptly and pulls to a stop on the shoulder

INTEXT STOPPED SEDAN

In the mirror the DRIVER watches TWO YOUNG TROOPERS getting
out of their car behind He reaches out to his right
unobtrusively unlatches the passenger-side door Then he
gets a PISTOL from the glove compartment and slips it out
of sight under road map open on the seat beside him

Sitting cool and eaSy he watches the lst Trooper stop

back of his right rear fender He pats his pockets makes

a sheepish show of searching for a wallet as the 2nd Trooper
comes on up to open window

DRIVER ‘
Wouldnt you know I dont have
it on me

4 2nd TROOPER’
Step out please

DRIVER
Out of the car What for

2nd TROOPER
Just get out Not too fast

Driver about to protest but then he sees Troopers hand go
down to holster Driver pops his eyes in kind of scared

surprise obediently fumbles at the door handle Thats his
last fumble

Like a steel spring he throws himself back flat on the seat

° and with both feet kicks rivers-side door savagely open
into gut of Trooper standing at it and keeps on rolling
right out through unlatched door on other side and lands
in a crouch with that gun in his hand and FIRES point-blank
at Trooper back of fender and spins around in front and

FIRES AGAIN at 2nd Trooper writhing windless on blacktop

v where door slammed him

CU - THE DRIVER

a DRIVER
m Oh sweet hell

FAST PULL BACK as he turns ‘Now we see a STATE POLICE BUS
parked just beyond where sedan stopped There are a DOZEN
ROOKIE TROOPERS standing in the road watching in some awe
The driver who is LIEUTENANT FRADY lowers his blank-

Gartridge pistol fairly disgustedly

FRADY
Each of you Write me five
reasons that would never happen
to you Thats all

Or

Prady shakes his head again at the Trooper still down on
the blacktop steps over him and gets back into car

narrowed eyes

CLOSER - WHEEL RIM

Theres a regular little indentation in one of them A
small punched-in holiow in the steel like could have been
made by a rifle bullet Frady sticks a forefinger in it
PAN to the other wheel rim It lies with its bent oval
shape matching the first but there is no ‘iittie hollowed
indentation in this one

of Social Structure was organized
in 1958 during the Eisenhower

FULL SCREEN - PROJECTED SLIDE PHOTO

It packs a big wallop Its a grainy enlargement of a POLITICAL
ASSASSINATION Its no particular event that we can identify

in time or place but it has elements of all of them The VICTIM
is turned away so we cannot see his face but a piece ef his-
skull is obscurely detached and seems to be taking wing

A FLASH of that and a small os CLICK SOUND and we get
ANOTHER SLIDE Same event from a different angle seen perhaps
three seconds later The victim is falling now though we
still NEVER SEE HIS FACE and there is a fine spray that must
be blood and the PEOPLE AROUND are now perceiving Mouths
opened in existential terror as in Munchs painting of a scream

Just a FLASH of that one too and the os CLICK and we get a
third slide This one will remain a while It shows same
unspeakable event from yet another angle A group of SPECTATORS
watching from some distance Setting might be a PUBLIC PARK

fhe feature of it is this perhaps TWENTY SPECTATORS in the
frozen shot all but three of whom have had their faces CIRCLED
IN BLACK INK on the negative with VARIOUS DATES INKED ALONGSIDE
Dates like 12964 and 41965 and so on The THREE PEOPLE at

-extreme right hand edge of slide are NOT CIRCLED AND DATED

These are ONE MAN by himself and a BLURRY COUPLE who seem to
have been holding hands as the photographer caught them

Godawful in many ways Reeks of
violence keeps slave populations
crammed in vile ghettos from coast
te coast Hypocritical and unjust
tasteless overbuilt and under-
developed can elect a Richard
Nixon But Its the last best
a oy hope of the world Whats wrong
- with America can possibly be
changed Provided its existence
is preserved We must manage its
suryival -- manage it
(and no doubt he
‘Means all this)
The great threat to survival is
our pattern of native violence
True we got along with it for
two centuries We had buffalo
to slaughter and Indians and
blacks and gooks But those
outlets are no longer permissible
They are acceptable only to
contemptible maniacs So how
will we live with our inbred
violence for the next century
Or fifty years or even ten --

rifle a handful of activists
outraged black men frightened
rich people on the hill -- each
presses on the others living

sacred miniscule possessions
And his sense that no one cares

(pause)
Get a rifle get a pistol get a
club something with knots in the
end that will break a skull Save
bottles Fill them with low-lead
gas and stuff a rag in and throw
it Make a bomb Keep it handy

Youll see the nameless THEY coming
down your street one day one
evening in the spring Then what
will you do Maybe theyll be all
black with beards and a crazy red
light in their eyes Maybe theyre
white brutish and big and tough
and bald with shotguns and automatic
weapons -- and ‘uniforms How do
you dissipate that pattern

Thats what my Bureau is for We
were funded as a group to look for
ways to channel sociological
upheavals into coherent patterns
and find ways to ease them

(coming back to Frady)
And doyou know sir So far we
have not been at all successful
Our researches indicate a society
that is NOT coherent that is
basically NOT manageable That

greater dramas acted out in scenes

knife is waiting with it as his mother and Frady come through
the swinging door He lunges and nicks Fradys arm but Frady
is twisting already and backhands the kid knocking him flat
on his ass Marian makes whimpering noises The TV set sings
that life is great with a Coke Frady flips out his badge

- FPRADY
Dont move Dont do anything
Im a police officer

He might as well say hes from Mars Frady understands

ANGLING ON TODD

Kid comes to life scrambles up and tries to grab another
knife from set on magnetic holder Frady gets around in

front and wallops him again and knocks him cold for sure

EXT STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE

Gould has the door of Frady‘s car open Hes holding a metal
box about the size of a cigarette carton He twists a little

timer-knob on the end slips the box under the drivers seat

As hes closing the car door theres a big muffled BOOM
BOOM from inside house It seems to surprise him a little
He steps back into the street fFrady appears at living room
window He looks directly out at Gould and jerks his head
Gould hesitates Then he slips a hand in a side pocket and
heads for the front door

INT MARIANS HOUSE

Frady opens the door Gould slides in Frady closes the
deer and slams Gould with his gun Gould tumbles and Fradys
right on top of him on his knees smashing his head again and
again with pistol butt a

TIGHT LOW ANGLE - UP AT FRADY

Hes seriously berserk flailing with his revolver and yelling

like he did at the late Dr Malinowski

FRADY
Sonofabitch It was YOUR ZOMBIES
ALL THE WAY Wasnt it WASNT IT

Hes not going to get any answer The mans skull has been
cracked in any number of places Frady stops in midswing
He shivers Perhaps its occurring to him that he does
belong with Trumbulls murderous Bureau He shivers again
at the os sight of what he has just done and stands up

ANOTHER ANGLE
Marian has appeared in bg and is just staring

FRADY
That was the last easy one You
got anything I could drink

She disappears back into kitchen like she didnt hear Frady
bends and slips an automatic from Goulds side pocket drops
it into his own Hes still holding his revolver by the
barrel He notices foreign matter on the butt He goes and
wipes it on a drape

INT KITCHEN

Todd is still out cold Marian is cradling his head sponging
it where it got bashed against edge of table Frady walks in
Theres another lyrical commercial on the TV Frady kills it
and looks down at them

CONT

FRADY

MARIAN

Whats that to do with anything

Frady nods Marian rises in a jerky mechanical way and opens
cabinet under sink She gets out a bottle of Liquid Drano”
with usual skull-and-crossbones warning and sets it down on
counter in front of Frady

MARIAN
You wanted something to drink
She goes down again beside her boy continues to sponge his
head

PRADY

EXTINT GARAGE IN BACK - TWILIGHT

Marians wagonis in it She stumbles out through the con-
necting door from house ahead of Frady who carries Todd

He pitches kid into back seat Marian still seems in a daze
so he pushes her in after and slams the door and jumps in
himself behind the wheel Frady starts the engine and backs
out fast

CLOSER ANGLE - IN THE STREET

Frady jams on the brakes and pushes backwards trying to
slide drivers seat backward on its tracks It will only
go a bit then jams He pushes open his door and fumbles
at the seat catch CAMERA DROPS We see his fingers brush
around the end of another metallic box under the seat
exactly like the one we saw Gould slip into his own car in
ront -

FRADYS VOICE

IN SIDE-VIEW MIRROR

What could be the shadowy figure of a MAN is seen to step
back behind a tree PAN to Prady Hes looking in the
mirror seeing this and has not going to worry about his
seat position any more just now He pulls the door shut
and spins the wheel and guns off down the street

ANOTHER SHOT - SAME STREET

It was a man behind that tree He steps out We may recog-
nize him hes the fellow who picked up Claire and was with
her when Frady phoned that early morning If we fail to
recognize him no matter He walks quickly to a car parked
in driveway engine idling Behind its wheel is Willy
Fellow jumps in and they take off

Frady rounds a curve at speed one eye locked on the now-
dark rear-view mirror Its late when he sees what is

dead ahead lowered gate of a RAILWAY GRADE CROSSING with

a DIM RED LIGHT flashing and swinging as a LONG SLOW FREIGHT
lumbers through

FLASH CUTS

Prady tries to floor the brake but with the seat way forward
that way his knee snags the dash and he misses the pedal

and Marian jumps up in back and screams and Frady kicks
again and yanks at hand brake and spins the wheel all at
once and the wagon slews around to a crazy crash stop

ANGLE - STOPPED WAGON

Its behind is right through the guard gate about a yard
fromthe clattering train Marian has been pitched forward
into the front seat Frady jumps out his knees watery with
velief and anger Damn stuck seat almost killed him He
ducks down slamming at the seat catch trying to see and
feel whats jamming the track underneath He sees PUSH IN
TIGHT as he freezes for a split second and then shouts

FRADY

OVERHEAD SHOT
Prady leaps up and yanks open back door hauls at Tedd
Just as he gets him out theres an EXPLOSION from under the

drivers seat a blasting flash that sends Frady and Todd
backward through the air

DOWN THE ROAD A PIECE

Willys car coasts to a stop on the shoulder with no lights
He and the Other Killer get out Moonlight glints on their
357 magnum revolvers

ON FRADY

Hes stunned in a ditch He stumbles up and runs to the
wagon Its not burning but one look is enough The whole
front-seat section has been blown totally to hell It went
off right under Marian He goes back to whare he picked

Sudden BLAZE OF LIGHT on Frady and the BWAAAANG of a ricochet
A shiny new gash has appeared in the blown-off door panel
Frady rolls Todd into the ditch and dives in after him whip
ping revolver from its holster

OVER FRADYS SHOULDER - DOWN THE ROAD

The HEADLIGHTS of Willys car are on him blindingly BANG
and BANG and Frady has shot them both out A beat of nothing
and then a figure pops up from ditch and FIRES at him and as
Frady FIRES ONCE back it is-gone and another figure pops up
from ditch on the other side and FIRES too and also instantly
is gone Theyre like tin figures in a mechanical shooting
gallery -

BACK TO FRADY 24
Hes poised with “finger on trigger then thinks of something
Flips out cylinder of his revolver His thought was correct
two bullets blown inside Marians house another three just
now That leaves him here in a ditch with a badly hurt kid
and exactly ONE BULLET left and he isnt packing ammo The
situation is not wholly promising He turns his head to look
behind him

ON TRUMBULL

- He can’t believe it This nobody jerkwater cop has raped
aan - his very essence is actually turning his back on Edward
mc Trumbull It unglues him completely With inutterable fury
‘ Trumbull takes a step backward and whips out a little nickel-
plated revolver

REVERSE ANGLE

It happens quicker than it can be described Trooper Johnson
screams “Watch out and leaps up pulling his own revolver
but something like this was just wnat Frady hoped would happen
and he yells “Mol at the Trooper and backhands him and
goes in a twisting dive at Trumbull and Trumbulls little
a gun says BANG and at same instant theres a really cannonlike
- BOOM BOOM BCOMI -

QO

TOWARD TRUMBULL

He doubles forward with a look of sheer astonishment Its
so staged that for an instant he looks absolutely identical
to famed frozen picture of Lee Harvey Oswald getting gut-shot
by Jack Ruby With dying amazement Trumbull folds and
erashes to the floor beneath Frady

CAMERA CRANES UP FAST Theres a GUY in civvies at the side
who mustve just walked in He holds a smoking revolver

It was he who put the blast on Trumbull An astonished moment
Frady s head and ours still ring with the stunning reverbera-
tion of those four fast shots in this enclosed space

The Guy lowers his revolver Almost lazily he hauls a leather
folder from his hip pocket and flips it open A small gold
badge gleams inside

THE GUY

(southern drawl)
Officuh Ellinsworth ahm from

New Oleans Come up to see you
all bout a fugitive Aint it

mighty lucky

‘Frady still looks uncomprehencing Theras blood coming from

his shoulder where Trumbulls snap-shot winged him in midair
He rolls Trumbull over The eyes are glazed and open and

dead The tongue will never wag again In bg other TROOPERS
are rushing in with drawn revolvers

TIGHT CU - FRADY

‘Something goes off violently inside his brain He looks up
again oS

FRADY AND THE COP FROM NEW ORLEANS

Frady recognizes him He was behind one of those banquettes
in La Jardiniere Lt Frady stares into the mans face

and sees a labyrinth of dark tunnels Stretching into infinity
ahead of hin

FRADY
Oh sweet hell
FREEZE on that
The End
