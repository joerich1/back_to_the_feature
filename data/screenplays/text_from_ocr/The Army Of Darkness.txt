1 GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MANS DESPERATE FACE 1
This is Ash mid twenties square jaw firmly set and a pair of
haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear Ash speaks to
the CAMERA with urgency

ASH
Why would you say that I am
insane I wouldnt say that Ive
lost my mind simply because Ive
heard the voices and seen the
godless things moving in the
woods If anything I think more
clearly now than ever before I
know now that there is such a
thing as a living Evil A dark
and shapeless thing that lives
not in the spaces we know but
between them In the Dark In the
night And it wants the exact same
thing as you and I a chance at
warm life on this Earth It
doesnt care that is already had
that chance once Now listen
closely because there isnt much
time Listen and believe because
its all true

Peace was made between the two
peoples And a new nation was
formed They offered my a chance
to stay among them and teach them
A chance to lead them To be
King But Sheila was gone
Besides I had places to go
FLAMES OF THE FIRE - CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL
625 THE
WISEMEN

mix a vat of liquid over a fire as they recite a passage from

the Necronomicon A flask is dipped into the liquid
WISEMAN JOHN
hands the flask of liquid to Ash
WISEMAN JOHN
The Book tells us that each drop
allows a man to sleep a century
Swallow six drops and thou shalt
awaken in thine own time
ASH (VO)
Yeah Right
Ash takes the flask and studies it
but what other choice did I

have
DISSOLVE TO

DAY 626

ASH
rides off
ASH (VO)
I had to find a place to crash
For a very long time
627 EXT CAVE -
DAY 627
ASH
with the aid of his horse drags the Deathcoaster inside the
cave
He sets the horse free
ASH
YAHH
It gallops off
628 INT CAVE -
DAY 628
ASH
Places a black powder charge at the mouth of the cave He
ignites the fuse and climbs into the car
ASH (VO)
I locked the door
629 INT MOUTH OF THE
CAVE 629
BOOM
The powder charge blows The caves entrance is sealed shut
with an avalanche of rock
630 INT CAVE -
DEATHCOASTER 630
The car headlights come on piercing the blackness
631 INT

DEATHCOASTER

ASH
uncorks the flask filled with the Wisemans brew

ASH (VO)
I closed my eyes
He lets six drops fall into his mouth One for each century
he must sleep
ASH (VO)
I took a drink
Ash is unaware that an extra drop has fallen into his mouth A
7th drop Ash swallows the liquid

ASH (VO)
I didnt know if it was day or
night I started to get

drowsy And I slept
632 ASH

falls into a deep slumber

DISSOLVE TO

633 THE DEATHCOASTERS

HEADLIGHTS 633
fade

DISSOLVE TO

634 CLOSER ON ASHS SLEEPING
FACE 634
now in a different position Time has passed He needs a shave
ASH
And dreamed
635 THE HANDS ON ASHS
WRISTWATCH 635

wind faster and faster then halt and rust in time lapse
photography The leather band rots away and the watch falls
Ashs wrist

from

636 THE
SUN

rises then sets
637 THE
MOON

follows
638 A
CRACK

forms along the surface of the aging rock wall
ASH (VO)
Dreams last lasted centuries
639 A BARREN
TREE

sprouts buds they swell forming leaves which change to the
brilliant colors of fall then drop

FROST

covers Ash
641 ICICLES

on the ceiling of the cave melt The water drops down onto
Ashs face He stirs
642 ASH

awakens in a heap of rusted scrap which was once the
Deathcoaster His clothes and armor having deteriorated he is
buck ass naked as he staggers to the mouth of the cave He digs
at the rocks that block the caves entrance Sunlight streams
into the hole he has created
643 EXT
HILLSIDE

ASH
climbs from the cave and steps into the sunlight
ASH (VO)
And when I awoke
644 ASH

beholds
645 A FUTURISTIC CITY -

after the next Nuclear war a dead land
646 ASHS
POV

A FRACTURED CLOCK TOWER

lays sprawled on its side The time of mankinds death frozen

on the cracked face of the clock
647 A SHATTERED
BRIDGE 647
abruptly ends a third of the way across a river it once
spanned Upon it rest heaps of futuristic yet rusted taxicabs
piled eight deep in some places
CAMERA PULLS BACK from a stunned Ash amidst the atomized pieces
of iron and bone
ASH
I found that I had slept too
long
648 ASH

is so small a dot now and so far away that we almost cant
hear his terrified SCREAM
CUT TO
BLACK
THE END
