EXT space - NIGHT 1
In Space millions of twinkling stars

JAGGU (VO)
Aasman mein kitne taare hai Kabhi
ginne ki koshish ki hain Aaj ginna
shuru karoge to takreeban 6 hazaar
saal lagenge sirf humare galaxy ke
taare ginne mein Aur aisi kitni
galaxies hain Scientists kehte
hain shayad do billion aur Toh kya
yeh sambhav nahi ki antriksh mein
mandrate ean karodo taaron ke
beech kahi kisi eak planet pe hum
jaise log baste ho Jais e hum unhe
khojne ke liye chaand aur Mars pe
ja rahe hain ho sakta hain wo
bhi hame khojne yahan aa rahe ho

Haunting music sets in as the semi-circle of the huge blue
planet ‘earth’ appears Titles begin

Earth starts getting closer and closer

A cloud travels over the land of Rajasthan over various
havelis forts the city scape and finally over a vast
stretch of barren land

EXT SAMBHAR LAKE - NIGHT 2

Wide barren landscape The only monument seen is the temple
on a small hill

The cloud descends on the ground

Through the cloud emerges a face A naked man looking around
curiously He smells the air

Behind him the space ship camouflaged in a cloud Flash of
dull lightning appear from it

We see a pair of feet on the barren land The feet cautiously
move forward to reveal a naked alien’s back

The only object on the alien’s body is a small stone-like
round device tied with a metallic thread on his neck

He touches it

and the cloud rises up
EXT salt pan railway tracks - MORNING 3

A Rajasthani man with a big moustache and a turban walks next
to the railway track A train behind him

A two-in-one hangs across his shoulder playing a song
The naked man stops and sees the train from a distance
The Rajasthani man stops too

Standing far off on the barren landscape -- a naked man
The naked man and the Rajasthani man exchange looks

His finger presses the stop button on the recorder
Suddenly the naked man runs towards the Rajasthani man

The Rajasthani man turns back but the train passes him and he
recoils back

By that time the naked man is next to him
The Rajasthani man looks at the gleaming object on his neck

The naked man watches carefully He looks at the guy and
smiles

The train by then has passed by

The Rajasthani man-- suddenly snatches the glistening object
from around the naked man’s neck Runs

The naked man is baffled for a moment Then runs after the
thief

The thief jumps on to the train

The naked man tries to grab him What he gets in his hand is
the thief’s two-in-one recorder

As he tries to climb up the train the thief throws salt on
his face and the naked man stumbles across the track

The train speeds away
The naked man stands there panting Devastated

The train is gone and so is his gleaming object All that
remains in his hand - a two-in-one radio

The naked man looks at it trying to figure it out The two-
in-one covers his vitals

alone on the gleaming tracks
The soothing music continues over

JAGGU (VO)
Jo chor le gaya voh spaceship ko
vapas bulane ka yantra tha Bina es
remote ke voh apne ghar nahi laut
sakta tha Na voh humari boli
jaanta tha na uska koi dost tha
yahan Akela sehma hua ek hi baat
soch raha tha Ab ghar kaise
lautoonga

suddenly appears infront of him They are alone on the metro
and dance through the empty compartment till PK realises he

PK sits quietly looking down

Not an eye is dry- in the studio or out in the public
All except one Tapasviji sits there-- defeated

He looks at the cameras all pointed towards jaggu

He turns to PK

He too is looking down

Feeling that no one is watching him he moves towards the
REMOTE on the table but a hand stops him from picking it

It is Jaggu’s father He shakes his head suggesting ‘its a
bad idea’

He grabs the REMOTE Goes and hands it to PK and touches his
cheek with affection

JAGGUS FATHER
Thank you beta

PK is not even looking at the remote His eyes are on Jaggu
Jaggu is talking to Sarfaraz Smiling with tears

PK watches sad

EXT RAJASTHAN DESERT ROAD- morning 112
A bus comes to halt on a rough road near the salt pans

PK and Jaggu inside the bus exchange a look Sadness on
their face

Jaggu looks at the shining device dangling from PK’s neck
She buttons his shirt to hide it

There is awkwardness in PK’s eyes

Both get down PK hands his two-in-one to Jaggu

PK
Tanik ee pakdo

PK climbs up the roof of the bus to take his trunk down He

lowers the trunk and
the lid opens

CRASH

ALKALINE BATTERIES spill out of them

Frantic-- PK jumps down and bends to collect the batteries

He is like a man possessed

Jaggu is gaping at the hundreds of little battery cells

spread all over on the dusty road

Jaggu

PK Tum apne saath BATTERIES le ja

rahe ho

PK still collecting them in a frenzy

his eyes

Pk
ohha nahi milta na

Jaggu

gestures upwards with

He holds the rear steps of the bus and starts to climb

Jaggu
PK Jaane do

PK yells while climbing as the bus

PK
Arre jaane kaise de Sab Batteriya

The bus moves away

Jaggu is left alone with PK’s trunk and the two-in-one

She casually looks at the two-in-one Hits the button

And the stillness of the place is broken by her own sound--

Jaggus VOICE ON THE TAPE
Tumhare panet pe sabke kaan aise
bahar hote hain Aur wahan sab log
nange ghoomte hain Kya dekh rahe
ho kuch laga hai mere gaal pe

Puzzlement on Jaggus face She hits the forward button and
again-- Her own voice

Jaggus VOICE ON THE TAPE (CONT’D)
Pata hai main na dasvi mein thi
jab maine apni pehli kavita likhi
thi papa ke liye Main dikhti hoon
maa jaisi sab kehte hain Sab kehte
hain sach kehte hain

THUK Her finger has stopped the tape Pulled it out Her
heart is thumping

She puts in another tape and what she hears again is her
own voice--

Jaggus VOICE ON THE TAPE (CONT’D)

KHATAK - the tape lid opens she takes out the tape and
inserts another one

Presss the play button

JaggU’S VOICE ON THE TAPE

Far away the bus stops

PK comes down with the trunk

The conductor yells at him

Meanwhile Jaggu presses the stop button

For a moment PK doesn’t answer pretends he is thinking
thenas if he remembers

PK
Tumri aawajiya Hai na tum jaun
ektho poetry boli thiuu hai na

Jaggu
Sirf ek poetry

Pk
Ab tumse LOVE thodi karte hain
jaun poora tame tumpe baste karega

Jaggus eyes get moist She stays quiet
Wind gushing sound makes PK turn

The windmills are going ballistic

Far away a cloud is descending

PK looks at Jaggu one last time

Turns and walks away The battery cells inside the trunks
making the clanging sound

Jaggu watches him go as dust flies with the gushing wind

Jaggu vo
Usne eak baar bhi palat ke nahi
dekha Shayad Apne ansoo chhipa
raha tha

A bitter wind is blowing on his face and he is fighting back
his tears

Jaggu watches him

Jaggus VO
Kuchh sekh ke gaya kuchh sekha ke
Jhooth bolna seekh ke gaya aur
seekha ke gaya pyaar shabd ka sahi
matlab
He loved me enough to let me go

His eyes tearful He smiles at her through her tears and
nods

Looks with pride and affection at another seat

Her father is looking at her with immense pride
Jaggu (CONT’D)
Jab tak zinda rahongi har raat

karongi I’m sure wo bhi wohi
karega I miss him

Jaggu shuts her book
Crowd claps Cutting through the claps is a loud whistle
Jaggu looks

His father whistles and continues whistling long after the
claps have stopped

Tears roll down Jaggu’s cheeks
