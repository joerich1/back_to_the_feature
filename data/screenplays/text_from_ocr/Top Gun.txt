1 EXT NIGHT - THE PACIFIC IS ANYTHING BUT

WINDS HOWL Rain drives horizontal The sea surges up
nearly to the flight deck of the Aircraft Carrier USS Kitty
Hawk The carrier plunges driving its bow into a wall of
grey water The deck pitches forward and back rolls left to
right and yaws in a corkscrew motion The entire 93000 ton
behemoth rises and falls in the TYPHOON-DRIVEN SWELL

2 SOMETHING DROPS DOWN OUT OF THE NIGHT

A ROAR Silver wings flash by a cockpit fiery jet

exhausts A forty ton monster drops at 120 knots into an area
the size of a tennis court in a CONTROLLED CRASH

2A A SHOWER OF SPARKS A SCREECH OF RUBBER AND METAL as

the gear hits the deck The hook catches the 3 wire and the
F-14 TOMCAT is slammed to a halt Its the scariest thing
youve ever seen the most dangerous maneuver in aviation and
just another day at the office for a Naval Aviator

7 EXT THE TWILIGHTS LAST GLEAMING - (AERIAL)

We float like gods above the storm above the cloud cover
looking down From overhead a probe slides into frame then
a graceful nose The cockpit sides by Pilot then Radar
Intercept Officer (RIO) barely illuminated by the orange glow
of their instruments The fuselage gracefully swells to two
enormous air intakes then variable angle wings swept back
for high speed flight Twin tailbooms cant outward
horizontal stabilizers make constant adjustments Enormous
twin jet exhaust ports glow red in the moonlight

raining snakes up there Hell be

STINGER
I know some RIOS are a little
wiggybut you abuse the
priviledge I dont believe Im
going to have to put the two of you
in the same cockpitbut there it
is It may be good for the Navy It
might be good for you but most of
all its good for me Itll get
you out of my sight

Goose and Maverick exchange looks

GOOSE
Mavs a great flyer but

STINGER
Hes a hell of a flyer In fact
hes so damn good he might have
been picked for Top Gun himself
Except for one thing (SCREAMS) He
just cant seem to follow orders

Stinger moves slightly to stand now directly in front of
Maverick and speak eye to eye at four inches
STINGER
You just did an incredibly brave thing
What you should have done was land your
plane You dont own that plane the
taxpayers do I should ream you out for
it But it just doesnt work with you
Youre a hell of a flyer You are maybe
too good You never really stepped in
it yet So this is your chance Im
gonna send you up against the best They
are better than you Maybe theyll knock
that shine off your eagle and youll
see finally where discipline and
teamwork fit it

With the tensions in the world today the potential for

carrier pilots will be the first
ones there Air combat excellence
is vital

Ice is not looking at the speaker but rather in our
direction HOLLYWOOD a blond good-looking pilot whispers
something to him and gestures Ice is getting the lowdown on
someone The camera moves and we see who that someone is as
Maverick enters the frame

Someone once asked me if
training men for air combat made
the world less safe--flying loaded
guns an accidental confrontation
and so forth

Maverick feels the stare of the other man and glances in his
direction Their eyes meet Ice smiles coldly

VIPER (Cont)
My answer is the dangerous thing
is being unprepared You want
trouble thats what you get when
things dont work out when you
cant do what you say you can When
you dont know what you can do And
when your opponents arent sure
either We are not policy We dont
make policy Elected officials
Civilians do that We are the
instrument of policy The tip of
the spear So we had best be sharp

Maverick has turned to look at Ice Ice glances back in his
direction Maverick looks at the back of the room where guys in
blue flight suits stand They are the instructors They look
relaxed poised mean Goose is looking up frontWhere Viper
has stopped Goose nudges Maverick

Maverick knows hes in trouble considers the social
alternatives then tells him the truth

MAVERICK
Yes sir

A couple of ooos and aahhs from the guys The instructors
stare the challenge at him He slides lower in his seat

VIPER
Considering the company youre in
thats a pretty arrogant attitude

MAVERICK

Yes sir

I like that in a fighter pilot
(couple of laughs from the guys)
Its okay to be confident You have
to think youre King Kong to want
to try to land on carriers Just
keep in mind the other component of

They move closer to examine the names on the plaque

44 EXT O CLUB - NIGHT

Fast cars in the driveway fast music blares into the
night Its Wednesday Animal Night Maverick Goose
Hollywood and Wolfman walk to the entrance

45 INT WOXOF BAR

Loud music low ceiling plaques of the squadrons line the
walls A dancer gyrates on stage largely ignored by pilots
talking with their hands Every pretty girl in San Diego
seems to be here Its a noisy rowdy place--a steam
releaser for people under pressure Nevertheless there is
a control to it all there are none of the usual bar types
just pilots and Naval Officers
The Ghost Riders enter The place is on fire a mob of
dancers flashing lights blaring HARD ROCK MUSIC Beer
flows Pilots talk flying and hustle girls

NEARBY - AN A7 pilot stands by the bar He knows Goose and
speaks loudly for his benefit

A7 PILOT
You know the Fighter Pilots motto
Its better to be dead than to look
bad

They grin broadly Goose replies as they brush past

GOOSE
I dont know Frank anybody gets
off on bombing the shit out of dirt
has got to be queer

Goose exchanges friendly punches with the attack pilots
Mavericks introductions and friendly barbs are drowned by the
music Maverick is a bit reserved He doesnt move among the
crowd as naturally as Goose does Hollywood and Wolfman drift

away searching for quarry Goose orders beer He nods toward a
TALL YOUNG MAN across the room

GOOSE
Keller Black Lion Squadron I knew
him at Pensacola Hes damn good

MAVERICK
Is there anybody in the Navy you
dont know

GOOSE
Gotta keep track of the
competition

Goose suddenly reaches out and grabs a guy moving past

GOOSE
Slider -- they let you into Top
Gun If youre among the best in
the Navy I tremble for the
security of this country

SLIDER
Why Goose whose butt did you kiss
to get here
GOOSE
The list is long but
distinguished

SLIDER

Smiles good-naturedly shakes hands with Mav

SLIDER

SLIDER

So I heard Steers it pretty close
Sorry to hear about Cougar He was
a good man

MAVERICK

SLIDER
Yeah Thats what I meant

Suddenly behind them a flame shoots up Someone ducks his
head
and swallows it The pilot sets an empty glass on the bar

SLIDER
What was that

GOOSE
Flaming Hooker Sort of an
institution around here Or maybe
this is the institution I forget
which Its the house drink Itll
warm the cockles of your heart
and other things depending on where
you spill it

He motions to the barmaid and she moves over sets them up
GOOSE holds a demitasse glass The barmaid pours Drambuie They
look at Goose apprehensively Goose looks at nearby flyers in
Camo fatigues

GOOSE
You cant show fear in front of
MarinesTheyre like Dobermans
theyll go for your throat its
instinctive

He takes out match and lights it Maverick holds his arm

MAVERICK
You ever done this before

GOOSE
What been drunk Sure Plenty

He downs it all in one gulp slaps the glass on the bar still
aflame He stands there blinking

SLIDER
How was it

GOOSE
Could use a dash more jet fuel

The others are duly impressed Mavericks gaze falls on Ice
watching from the end of the bar - Slider takes one Maverick
takes one too downs it in a gulp Sundown taking up the
challenge motions for one The barmaid pours it

GOOSE
Careful dont make an ash of

yourself

He tries to drink the flaming concoction He tries to go fora
for

sip but its too close to his face he tries to tilt the flame
away but that doesnt work Finally he goes for the gulp He
burns his lip and misses He sets his hair on fire It goes up
in a WHOOOSH

SUNDOWN
Yeow

GOOSE
Mayday Down in flames

He throws a beer in Sundowns face quenching the fire Sundown
blinks through the beer

SUNDOWN
Thanks I needed that

HOLLYWOOD
You guys are not only crazy youre
dangerous

Ice comes up from the end of the bar He motions the Barmaid

another it comes Goose lights it He gulps it down cool as
hell
ICE
(Disdainfully)
Frat boys

He walks away Slider goes after him

MAVERICK
Who is that guy

HOLLYWOOD

GOOSE
No shit That why they call him Ice

HOLLYWOOD
Nope Its the way he flies - Ice cold
No mistakes Wears you down After
enough time you just get bored and
frustrated you do something stupid and

Maverick moves in Ices direction He passes Wolfman dancing
with a girl with bright purple fingernails
ANGLE - DANCEFLOOR

GIRL
Why do you all have such funny
names

WOLFMAN
You gotta have a call sign thats
just your ownnever changesyou

Then if someone shouts Wolf

WOLDFMAN
(smiles)
Oh I dont know

Goose comes up with his arm around a girl

GOOSE
Hey Mav this is Sally She doesnt
believe a word I say Tell her Im
married will you

MAVERICK
Yeah hes married--but then again

Sally laughs and tries to pull Goose back toward the dance

floor Something in Mavericks eyes makes him hang back with
his

partner

ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR - DANCERS

GIRL
Could I get a call sign

WOLFMAN
Well I dont know That depends

GIRL
On what

WOLFMAN
Well it doesnt just happen you

GIRL

WOLFMAN
OhIll think of something

Maverick smiles at this but seems on edge He watches a few
pretty girls enter and eye the pilots in their flight suits

turns and walks up to Ice who sits drinking with Slider
Maverick walks over to him Ice notices Sliders attention

to Maverick He turns and grins at him

ICEMAN
Figured it out yet

MAVERICK
Figured out what

ICEMAN
Who is the best

MAVERICK
Nope
ICEMAN
Need a hint
MAVERICK
I think I can work it out on my
own
ICEMAN

You like to work alone Ive heard
that about you

MAVERICK
Ive heard of you too You were in
124 with Bargamian

ICEMAN
And you were with Cougar He was my
roommate in flight school

MAVERICK
Hes a good man

ICEMAN
The best

SLIDER

You must have soloed under a lucky
few

the

pulls

star First the MiG then you slide
into Cougars place

GOOSE
Its not Cougars place Its ours

ICE
What do you think it was Was it
that MiG contact that did it

GOOSE
Did what

ICE
Got you here

GOOSE

Were here because were the best
flyers in the wing Not because of
some MiG encounter

SLIDER
What luck Guys fly their whole
career without seeing a MiG up
closeYoure famous

ICE
You mean notorious

Something in the way he says it Its not quite a joke more an
insult Mavericks about to take the whole conversation too far
when somethingsomeone catches his eye She catches quite a

eyes in this room She is very pretty and shes walking in on

arm of a Commander Maverick turns back but the moment has
passed Ice dismisses him with a nod and weak smile Goose

him away

MAVERICK
What do these guys think I made
Cougar quit

GOOSE
Pay no attention to it Theyre
just trying to rattle you Its all
psychological Sit downand drink

He deposits Maverick at a chair by a table where other pilots
cluster watching and listening to Bugs shoot down his
wristwatch
Maverick broods
BUGS
We were just really diving down and by
then we were right over downtown
Haiphong It was some great shit Jack
says What are you doing What what
am I doing Jack He says What are
you doing I said Im rolling in

Jack Bugs were at thirty-two
hundred feet Oh shit we were like
zooom So we scraped down at hundred

feet right over--downtown Hanoi Oh
shit goddamn it And blowing down the
river And so once we were there we let
down to about fifty feet just going down
the river and Jack says Bugs
dont ever do that again Okay right
Jack Ill never do that again

Maverick pays little or no attention He broods and drinks
Suddenly Hollywood nudges him he turns

MAVERICK
What what is it

HOLLYWOOD
Target passing Check your six

MAVERICK
Never mind mine Check hers

They turn Long legs great ass beautiful

HOLLYWOOD
Her six is a ten Uh oh a turn to
engage

HIS POV - ACROSS A CROWDED ROOM

Maverick sees a stranger and somehow he knows he knows even
then Wolfman turns sees her walking too

WOLFMAN
Bogey9 oclock level

SUNDOWN
Nine thirty Bogey You presume
that hostile
and

date

She

HOLLYWOOD

Well we should contact and check
it out

She has turned toward them She passes by They start to make a
move for her But just then she finds her date at the bar a
distinguished man with Captains stripes Their smiles freeze

they slide back in their chairs Maverick cant stop looking at
herAfter a while the intensity of his gaze draws her
attention She feels him She is nodding and smiling to her

but her eyes scan the room like radar A warning tone goes off

his brain dolu dolu dolu as they lock on him He feels that
thrill of excitement and fear you get when you know youre
targeted in someones scope Her eyes hold on him for a long
momentlong enough and then sweep by the rest of the room

turns her attention back to the Captain and laughs at something
he says

Over in a corner Goose chats up a couple of San Diego girls

GOOSE
The family unit -- thats the most
important thing Its the only
thing you can count on Im married
--did I tell you that

FIRST GIRL
Four times We dont believe you

GOOSE
Ive been married since I was
eighteen Why dont you believe me

SECOND GIRL
Because you dont look married

FIRST GIRL
Youre not even wearing a ring

GOOSE
(big smile)
I take it off when Im chasing
women Its the only honorable
thing to do
ANGLE - MAVERICK

Hes half listening to Bugs rattle on His eyes are drawn back

to the woman He tries not to stare She seems to know a lot of

people in the club He looks away Hollywood is chatting up a

girl with a sincerity that cannot be taught His line is just
as

polished as his appearance

HOLLYWOOD
You dont think about death up
there but you think a lot about
the danger One mistake and youre
a smoking hole in the ground

GIRL
I never knew it was so dangerous
HOLLYWOOD
Oh yeah it makes everything down
here more meaningful You feel a
certain intensity of life and you
want to grab onto every moment

Maverick looks up at the bar again A shock She (Charlie) is
staring right at him intensely as her date whispers something
in her ear She notices him staring back quickly looks away
embarrassed She says something to the man He nods and turns
away as someone else grabs his attention The woman now
wouldnt
look this way for anything She picks up her purse from the bar
and walks through the crowd and out of the room Impulsively
Mavericks up he follows

46 INT HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE BAR

He breaks out looks around doesnt see her Someone
disappears

around a corner He moves after

CORNER - A door slams shut Impulsively before he realizes
what

he is doing hes through it

47 WOMENS ROOM

A feminine GASP He should have looked at the sign on the
door
The realization of where he is hits him too late She is

standing

by the mirror with her make-up out looking back at him Hes
not quite sure what to do A hasty retreat would be

appropriate

an

if embarrassing Ah what the hell he is a fighter pilot He
just walks right over to herno idea what he will say Shes
got her lipstick out twisting it She looks over at him with

amused smile

CHARLIE
Long cruise was it

She leans over the sink puts on lipstick sees his eyes cover
her

CHARLIE
Anything I can do to help Lieutenant

MAVERICK
Lots of things

She laughs He is sort of attractive but there are other girls
in the room she doesnt want to be too encouragingShe tries
not to grin at his embarrassment

CHARLIE
Ill bet
MAVERICK
UhhhAnything I can do for you
She laughs again doesnt know what it iscould be chemical

but shes instinctively attracted

CHARLIE
Yeah Hold this It might be safer

She hands him a makeup mirror Starts redoing her lipstick He
just stares at herShe looks up at him than back to her
warpaint Finally when it comes it is cool and amused

CHARLIE
Now I know why all the girls come
here They know how horny you guys

MAVERICK
Its not that

Mock anger Shes toying with him
CHARLIE

MAVERICK

CHARLIE
Thats a big comfort to me

MAVERICK

MAVERICK

The other girls look at him expectantly A beat He just
stands there then realizes hes holding her lipstick

MAVERICK

concept in cosmetics

48 EXT O CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT
POV -

From a car in the parking lot we see Charlie and the Captain
leave the club They walk directly toward us and stop She

turns
says something politea peck on the cheek He turns away A
dome light briefly illuminates the interior of the car as a
door
opens It rocks slightly as someone gets in Charlie turns back
and walks over taking her keys out She opens the door to the
car and gets in
48A EXT CAR - NIGHT
She starts the car and pulls away Suddenly a figure sits up
in

the back

MAVERICK

Startled she nearly drives off the road She turns to him
startled

CHARLIE

MAVERICK
Everybodys got to be somewhere

CHARLIE

MAVERICK

sees the pretty girl pull up and stop leans over helpfully

MARINE

She smiles even more sweetly
CHARLIE
I dont know Corporal Can you do
anything about this lunatic
The car door swings open Maverick gets out The car roars
He stands in the glare of the spotlightrocking on his heels

looking across at the guard who snaps to attention and stares
holes in his chest

50 INT TOP GUN - NEXT MORNING

VIPER

Stops scratching

SUNDOWN FUNGUS

PORK

FUNGUS (Unhappily)
Itll stick anyway
Viper turns away

VIPER
Now to continue In this class we
will be dealing with F-5s and
A4s as our MiG simulators
Technically the F-5 does not have
the thrust to weight ratio of the
MiG-21--it also does not bleed
energy below 300 knots like the
MiG-21 does The A4 does not turn
as well as the MiG-17 but has
significantly better visibility

Maverick looks back to his notes SFX footstepsdoor
opening Viper looks up to back of room door

VIPER
Hi Charlie Good our TAGREFs
here Charlies the most qualified
to get into P subs and curves and
VN diagrams

Maverick turns to see the TAGREF walk forward Maverick
stares at her as she passes without acknowledging him He is
surprised embarrassed

VIPER
Charlotte Blackwood--code name Charlie--
not your ordinary TAGREF Charlie has
her PhD in astrophysics--shes a
civilian contractor so you dont salute
heror anything else Is that clear

She walks to the front and starts her presentation She

talks about something very technical arcane MiG tactics
technology As the briefing rattles on Maverick reacts to
her Goose glances over at him He too recognizes the girl
He looks at his partner Maverick feels his stare

CHARLIE
Hello I think I have some new data for
youNow a MiG 21 has a problem with
the inverted flight tanks It wont do a
Negative G push over Even below one G
they risk a flame out Operationally
they will do a zero to one G only

A snicker from the audience She hesitates momentarily goes
on
CHARLIE

The latest intelligence shows that
the most they will do in operation
is oneis there something wrong
Lieutenant

MAVERICK
I dont think youre altogether
rightabout the MiG that is
She stops--some of the pilots look at him Viper glares

CHARLIE
I beg your pardon

MAVERICK
No I beg yours But I dont think
youre right on that

CHARLIE
Why not

MAVERICK
I saw one

CHARLIE

You saw a MiG 21

MAVERICK
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive

CHARLIE
(She doesnt believe him)
Where did you see that

MAVERICK
Its classified

Nervous buzz in the room Viper goes rigid Charlie cant
believe it

CHARLIE
Its what

MAVERICK
Its classified Like Hollywood
says I could tell you but then
Id have to kill you

Pork stifles a laugh the others chuckle Viper is
embarrassed

VIPER
Maverick

She stops Viper with a glance

CHARLIE
Its all right
She can handle it She is very cool not overbearing She
says it calmly She doesnt want to embarrass him any more
than he is but she has to get the facts straight

CHARLIE
Lieutenant I have a top secret
clearance The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you

MAVERICK
Not in this case
CHARLIE
(Flatly)
You saw a MiG push negative 4G

MAVERICK
Yes maam

CHARLIE
Where were you

MAVERICK
On his six

Little stifled laughs

CHARLIE
He was in a 4G Negative dive and
you were on his six

MAVERICK
Yes maam At first Then I was
directly above him

She stares at him for a moment then she has him She goes
for the kill

CHARLIE
If you were directly above him how
did you see him

MAVERICK
I was inverted

A real buzz in the room Ice laughs audibly

CHARLIE
You were in a 4G inverted dive with
a MiG 21 (She cant believe it)

At what range
MAVERICK
Two

CHARLIE
Two miles

MAVERICK
Two meters

Chuckles barely suppressed Goose pipes up to deflect
attention

GOOSE
One and a half actually I gota

MAVERICK

CHARLIE

What were you doing there

MAVERICK
Giving him the bird

Open laughter She thinks its at her She grows red

CHARLIE
The what

MAVERICK
You know The finger

He shows her but she can handle this

CHARLIE
So youre the reason those
SALT talks failed

The room breaks into laughter At him Now he grows red
Goose puts his hand on Mavericks arm shakes his head as if
to say Let it go pal she got you

She looks at Viper He doesnt know whether to laugh or cry
He knows theres something here he doesnt control

VIPER
Lieutenant
GOOSE
Its just like he says sir

VIPER
(He snaps)
I dont care

51A CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE LECTURE HALL
She walks away He runs up and stops her

MAVERICK
Why didnt you tell me you were a
TAGREF

She studies him coolly for a moment like a specimen

CHARLIE
It never came up

MAVERICK
You let me make a fool of myself

CHARLIE
You seemed determined to do that
anyway Why didnt you tell me you
were a famous MiG insulter
MAVERICK
Would it have made a difference

CHARLIE
No

MAVERICK
What would

CHARLIE

You know Im assigned to this
school I see sixteen new hotshots
every eight weeks Your attention
is flattering but not really
productive Why dont you keep your
mind on flying

She reaches over and aligns his collar insignia

CHARLIE
Why cant you keep this straight
She smiles at him and walks away Maverick turns sees the
others sizing him up Most of them grin Maverick moves down
the corridor past the COs Office Viper leans against the

doorsill He lights a pipe laconically eyes Maverick His
tone gives away nothing like an ELINT probe eliciting a
response

VIPER
Maverick Whered you get that
call sign
MAVERICK
Ahhh Runs in the family sir
VIPER

Youre father was Marvin Mitchell

MAVERICK
Yes sir

VIPER
A good man Good flyer

Viper turns away

MAVERICK
Yes sir Thank you sir

Maverick watches him for a beat hes been tested but hes
not sure how or why He turns to catch up with Goose and the
others

EXT SKY - LATER

At twenty-eight thousand feet the two planes circle each
other going in opposite directions As they jockey for
position they snap past each other like ends of bullwhips

The earth spins the horizon appears and disappears With
each hard turn Maverick and Goose can be heard grunting to
keep blood in their brains to keep from passing out

The fight is hard physical and exhausting The extreme G
forces--65--flatten them against their seats causing their
heads to weigh over one hundred pounds Maverick strains to
turn his head and track the other jet as it streaks past at
Mach One

MAVERICK
Ive lost him -- where is he

GOOSE
On your six -- coming hard Four
hundred Losing airspeed Hes on
your six and closing fast

Hard left HARD LEFT

Maverick jerks the stick left and the F-14 takes an
astonishing turn Jester ROARS past into a wide arc

GOOSE
Great move Great

MAVERICK
He shouldve had me

GOOSE
Take it down Lets bug out of
here Call for a draw

MAVERICK
No way Ill nail him this time
Going vertical

THE PLANE EXPLODES INTO AFTERBURNER - rocketing toward
space Jester is left in direct line with the sun and his
canopy is sprayed with a blinding glare Going ballistic is
dangerous The plane flys like a bullet obeying the laws of
physics not the pilots touch on control surfaces The
ballistic call warns other aircraft that he is for the
moment out of control

GOOSE
Hes blind -- you got him

JESTER
NO JOY NO JOY WHERE ARE YOU
IVE LOST SIGHT

GOOSE
Hes out of energy You got
control Unload

The F-14 peels over the egg in a backward dive It rockets
down the outside gaining energy Over the ROAR of jets the
SCREAM of the wind Goose shouts data but it is muffled a
distant voice in a typhoon Through the canopy we see
Jester and he hangs in the air like a sparrow in the path of
a falcon

PILOTS POV - HUD in windscreen - a diamond in a box
Maverick lines up the diamond with Jester and we hear the
high pitched tone BEEPING

and the low GASP of escaping steam Viper speaks quietly
like a funeral director consoling the living Makes you want
to scream
VIPER
WellThat about covers the
flyby

Jester almost breaks into a grin

VIPER
Nowin additionyou broke two
major rules of engagement And
Thats not good

Maverick gives no response Viper continues

VIPER
Lieutenant Candela lost sight of
you and called no joy You
failed to respond

He stops and looks at Maverick A beat Maverick finally
nods

VIPER
Why

Maverick is exhausted Its been a long rough day His
voice is a horse whisper

MAVERICK
I had him in view I was peeling
over the egg into a dive He saw
me when I moved in for the kill
There wasnt any danger

VIPER
(to Goose)
Is that how you remember it

GOOSE
Yes sir By the time we could
respond we were diving right into
his view

Viper is not satisfied with the answer but he moves on

VIPER
The hard deck for this hop was ten
thousand feet Jester at what
point did you call off the fight

JESTER
Just below ten thousand
VIPER
But you continued to fight

Another pause another grudging nod

VIPER
Why

MAVERICK
We werent below for more than ten
seconds There was no danger I had
the shot I took it

VIPER
The rules of engagement are not
flexible They exist for your
safety You will obey them
Is that clear

Maverick thinks about continuing the discussion but the
thought is momentary He quickly cuts his losses gives Viper
what he thinks he wantsHe is just on the cusp of too
sincere

MAVERICK

Yes sir perfectly clear I guess
we were I was just a little
over enthusiastic

Viper measures him for a moment then lets it go

VIPER
I guess you were Dismissed

Maverick and Goose leave the room Viper looks at Jester
picks up Mavericks fitness report Doesnt read it looks
back at Jester

JESTER
I dont know what to tell you
Skip

VIPER

Tell me one thing

Jester waits

VIPER
If you had to go into combat
would you want him with you

Jester turns walks slowly around the room The walls are
lined with pictures planes and pilotshistory There are
MiG killers attack squadrons ground personnelTheres one
picture of a Phantom in flight with the backseater mooning
the camera Other pictures show carriers famous flyers

reaction at watching its death throes

her mask

MAVERICK

He smashes the fish on a rock It is still

CHARLIE
No

MAVERICK
Its not suffering anymore

CHARLIE

half jokes)
Youre horrible

MAVERICK
Youre not cause you eat frozen

Things die Every time you breathe

You dont have to kill it

You ever think about killing
another human being

MAVERICK
About as much as they think about

They know the rules(this is too
strong for her she turns away he
comes around to her) Thats the
deal Thats why youre up there
Its him or me Thats the price of
admission (she draws away) It
bothers you why Youre part of

All youve got is one life I guess
its worth about the same to every

meaningless years of decline

dangerous you can look ahead
maybe ten seconds Thats your
whole future Thats as far as it
goes But imagine what those

There is lots of stuff I dont know

She had a long time to think about
it They say you reach an agreement
with death Come to accept the fact
that pretty soon you wont be here
I didnt see that She was very
bravebraver than I am You go up

Maverick looks up and sees the other two-man team the
victors waiting on the other side of the net for them Of
course it had to be Ice and SliderCharlie sits and watches
as the game gets immediately out of hand In moments
Maverick and Ice rotate to forward positions directly
opposite each other across the net Other revelers turn to
watch as it degenerates () to more than a game Maverick
glances at Charlie He seems uncomfortable but irrevocably
drawn into the confrontation She says nothing but her
attitude is apparent Back to the game Slider and Goose set
them up as they try to spike the ball in each others face
The final pointup over the middle They both go up
Maverick smashes Ice blocks but the ball sails away off
his forearm For the first time ever Maverick beats him He
looks over at Charlie she is staring out to sea She looks
back at him and hes suddenly had enough competition They
call for another game but Maverick turns away

completely enveloped by computerized radar The computers

calculate a number of aircrafts positions and velocities by
means of transponders in the ships and ground stations that
talk to each other thousands of times a second Using this

Charlie She smiles sympathetically at him

Unfortunately the gamble worked
or you might have learned
something The bandit never gets a
clean shotMaverick makes an
aggressive vertical move here
comes over the top and defeats the
bandit with a missile shot The
encounter was a victory but weve
shown it as an example of what not
to do Ice is next

Another computerized rendering comes up on the screen
Hollywood leans close to Maverick and speaks quietly

HOLLYWOOD
Gutsiest move I ever saw

Maverick gives him a small nod of appreciation

VIPER
And the dumbestOkay look at
this Its textbook Ice takes
control of the battle immediately
He never gives the bandit a chance
to take the offensive An early
turn here -- excellent He goes for
the jugular and its over just

advantage He is closer to the F-5s tail than the F-5 is to
his But he cant close cant line up the shot He grunts
and strains as the G force pushes him down

MAVERICK
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--IM
IN--ILL ENGAGE

ICE

ENGAGED IM IN

Maverick maneuvers close to their left circle

ICE
GET OUT OF THERE YOURE UNSAFE

MAVERICK

MAVERICK
YOU CANT SHOOT HIM I CAN IM IN

MAVERICK - ABOVE

MAVERICK
ICE ROLL OFF I CAN SHOOT HIM

ICE
NO NO NO HES MINE

Maverick is pulling a log of Gs but cant target his
weapons he continues to turn in a hard circle going round
and round without gaining He cant bring his nose to bear

MAVERICK
IF YOU CANT SHOOT HIM I CAN

ICE
NO I GOT HIM I CAN TAKE HIM

Ice stays

MAVERICK
COMING IN

Maverick dives down between the two planes pulling 65 Gs
exposing his underside to Ice All Ice sees is belly
Obviously in this attitude Maverick cant see him

ICE
(under breath)
Sonofabitch

He slams the stick hard right in toward Maverick
Ice quickly rolls up right in front of him

ICE
LOOK OUT

Maverick sees him flash into his view He has to slam the
stick forward to avoid collision He swings by real close
Too close

GOOSE
Oh no
They pass through Ices turbulence The blast distorts the
airflow to Mavericks left engine BOOMBOOMBOOM The engine
flames out Full thrust on the right engine swings the tail
around in a yaw Maverick slams the stick right to correct
but too late

GOOSE
Planes coupling up Planes
coupling up

The plane couples one yaw to the next--the tail swings
around-- which becomes an ever increasing flat spin like an
out-of -control frisbee

GOOSE
This is not good (Rising panic)
Were low

Maverick is pinned to the instrument panel by centrifugal
force desperately tries to reach back for the ejection
lever--but is falling short by about a foot

MAVERICK
m pinned to the panel

GOOSE
Time to go

MAVERICK
cant eject

The plane is spinning ever faster out of control He drops
the gear Still spins Goose is closer to center of spin--G
forces are less He reaches behind him for the eject handle
starts the eject sequence

GOOSE
3000 feet Ill do it

MAVERICK
Go ahead I cant reach 2000 feet
85A BOOM - A HURRICANE OF WIND AND NOISE

The canopy BLASTS away--but is held spinning above the
cockpit by the vortex of the sinking jet Goose glances up at
it

GOOSE

MAVERICK
Lets go Eject

Goose yanks the ejection handle Things happen in a split
second Goose is fired up and out by the rocket under his
seat Almost instantly he impacts the spinning canopy A
sickening CRUNCH The canopy is knocked away Maverick is
slammed back in his seat as the ejection seat straps wind up
He is BLASTED out of the plane just before it spins in

85B TIGHT ON MAVERICK AS HE TUMBLES IN SLOW MOTION

Hes in shockthe loud THUMPING of his heart labored
breathing a scream that stays in his mind

Instinctively he gropes for straps He releases the pilot
seat it tumbles away His chute streams balloons open
snapping his body like a bullwhip He drifts momentarily
then plunges into the sea

85C UNDERWATER

His face distorted in the water wild eyes disoriented
choking for air He reaches out finds nothing to grab
Suddenly he is yanked hard to the side

85D SURFACE

The parachute is caught by the wind and dragged pulling
Maverick along beneath the surface He is twisting in the
water turning over and over trying desperately to slip out
of the tangled straps He finally hits the surface of the
water and sucks air into his lungs With the end of his
strength he hits the release snaps and breaks free from the
parachute It whips away like a kite in a typhoon

The sea is choppy and rough He struggles as his equipment
drags him under He twists finds the inflatable raft
attached to his harness Maverick pulls the cord and the
raft hisses open He pulls his body into the six-by-two foot
raft and collapses completely exhausted The survival has
been almost without thinking an instinctual physical
struggle
85E TWILIGHT

Maverick begins to focus on the situation He stains the
water with dye then sees another parachute floating nearby
Paddling to the parachute he reaches over the side and
begins to pull on the heavy cords that are submerged in the
water

A great struggle The weight is extremely heavy Finally he
pulls a body to the surface Goose Goose is dead Maverick
releases the parachute and pulls Goose into the raft on top
of him He holds Goose in his arms His mind shuts down
again

From high above the ocean we see the debris on the water
An oil slick pieces of honeycomb titanium and the small
helpless figure in the raft

DISSOLVE TO
86 EXT OCEAN - NIGHT

Searchlights skim over the black ocean A brilliant light
flashes as Maverick pops a pencil flare Helicopter blades
flick powerfully The lights of the choppers descend toward
the wreckage area scanning the debris searching for life
The spotlights find Maverick and Goose in the raft

The draft from the chopper churns the water A FROGMAN drops
from the chopper and hits with a heavy splashes He surfaces
and swims to the raft as a rescue harness is lowered
Maverick watches curiously as he starts to examine Goose He
hugs Goose closer and looks threatened

FROGMAN

Let him go sir Take it easy

He tries to pry Goose free but Maverick has a death grip on
the body

FROGMAN
Sir Let him go Its all right
Let him go

Maverick glares at the man as he bobs in the water

Another long moment then Maverick releases Goose The
frogman quickly straps Maverick into the harness

HIS POV - He watches the lifeless body in the water as he
is pulled up and away He shivers from the cold

87 INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Extreme CLOSE ON Mavericks face He is emotionless His
eyes are flat and absolutely without expression There is
complete silence in the room Then we hear the quiet calm
probing voice of Viper

VIPER
How do you feel

MAVERICK
All right

VIPER
Goose is dead

MAVERICK

I know I was there

Not one sign of emotion from Maverick Not one tone of
expression We see Viper now and his face is strained from a
very long day

VIPER
If you fly jets long enough
something like this happens to you
No one escapes it It touches us
all

Maverick looks at Viper and his eyes are very disturbed

MAVERICK
He wasmy responsibility--my RIO

VIPER
My first squadron in Vietnam we
lost eight out of eighteen planes
Ten guys The first one kills you
but therell be others--you can
count on it

No reaction from Maverick He cant quite face up to that
reality right now
VIPER
Youve got to put him in the box

Maverick is watching Viper but he doesnt have anything to
say

88 EXT CHARLIES SPORTSCAR - NIGHT

MAVERICK

CHARLIE
You knew it You all do Its part
of it Maybe the most important
part

88A ON THE BEACH - NIGHT AND FOG

Charlies car pulls up They get out and walk down toward
the water Maverick seems dazed She is softly taunting

MAVERICK
Where are we

CHARLIE
Where are we You know where we
are Its called the beach Its
where life first crawled up out of
the sea I come here sometimes
when I feel like crawling back in

MAVERICK
You dont have to do this

CHARLIE
Do what show you a good time

MAVERICK
Im not good company I should be
alone

CHARLIE

I dont think so but if thats
what you want

They stand there not making a move

MAVERICK
No

CHARLIE
What do you want

MAVERICK
I want it back

CHARLIE
What

MAVERICK
Yesterday

She turns nods out past the moon

CHARLIE
You look way out there Out past
the date line West becomes East
all things change You cross the
linetoday becomes yesterdayor
tomorrow I forget which

MAVERICK
Thats what I want

CHARLIE
Of course the lines just
imaginary You can cross it twenty
timesnothing really changes

She turns and walks along the surfline

CHARLIE
On the beach Its what they say
when Navy men retireHes On The
Beach I always liked that I had
a picturein my head all these
old guys wandering around here
looking out into the past

He walks to the surf kicks the sand with his bare feet

MAVERICK
If we knew then what we know now
we might never have come up out of
there

He turns to her She just looks at him

CHARLIE
You dont believe that

MAVERICK
Hardly ever

CHARLIE
Only when youre depressed Then it
passes
MAVERICK
It does

CHARLIE
Everything passes Immutable law of
the Universe

He picks up a piece of flotsam a twig worn smooth

CHARLIE
This tooshall pass You put as
much life as you can between it and
you You start piling up experience
between then and now

He turns and walks

MAVERICK
What do you do when you come here

CHARLIE
I sit I think I play games

MAVERICK
What kind of games

CHARLIE
I like to play reality

She stops and turns

MAVERICK
How do you play reality

CHARLIE
Its strip reality actually like
what the pilots always want to
play

MAVERICK
(this gets a small laugh)
Strip reality How do you play
that

CHARLIE
Its like strip poker only
without the bluffing (he laughs
again) One person says something
and if the other one accepts that
its true the one who says it
gets to take one item of clothing
off

MAVERICK
Youre crazy (She stops he goes
on softer) Thats a pretty silly
game

CHARLIE
Not as silly as some You know the
silliest one that we are gods
That we control events on the
beach that we can turn back
time

She moves in close

CHARLIE
Want to play the game

MAVERICK
How does it go

CHARLIE
You say the truth (a beat)
Go ahead Dont be afraid You want
to win the game dontcha

MAVERICK
What truth

CHARLIE

A long pauseit comes hard

MAVERICK
Goose is dead

CHARLIE

(she nods)

True

MAVERICK

CHARLIE

Take something off

MAVERICK
Off me or off you
CHARLIE
Thats up to you

He takes the ribbon from her hair It falls down over her
face and shoulders Now its her turn

CHARLIE
Its dangerouswhat you do

He nods She slowly loosens his tie and pulls it from around
his neck

MAVERICK
It was my fault

She says nothing stands looking into his eyes He slowly
as if in a trance takes her blouse off

CHARLIE
You cant bring him back

She takes off his shirt

MAVERICK
It was my fault

He starts to reach for her She pulls back

CHARLIE
Nope Already used that

She turns and thinks for a moment looking at the moon

CHARLIE
Your life goes on

Rather than struggle his T shirt over his head she grabs it
with both hands She leans in close and bites it She grabs
both sides of the tear and slowly rips it off his body

MAVERICK
What does it mean

CHARLIE
(shakes her head no)
That wasnt fair It was a
question Penalty round

She drops her skirt

CHARLIE
You didnt mean it You didnt
think Youd do anything to take it
back

MAVERICK
Thats three

CHARLIE
And thats one

She unbuckles his belt slowly slides it off She unzips his
pants they fall

MAVERICK
One more

CHARLIE
Your watch

She unbuckles it

MAVERICK
You owe me one

He rests his head on her shoulder unhooks her bra She
shrugs it off

They stand on the beach in shorts and bikini bottom looking
into each others eyes

CHARLIE
Looks like a tie

MAVERICK
Whos gonna win

CHARLIE
Well say it together On the count
of threeOnetwo

Leaning in softer and harderthey both jump the gun

They embrace madly and sink to the sand From the distance
it looks like a strange slithering creature crawling back to
the sea

89 INT GOOSES ROOM - NIGHT

The lights are out in Gooses room at the Bachelor Officers’
Quarters The door opens and Maverick enters He sets a
cardboard box on the bed

Silently Maverick gathers together Gooses few personal
possessions He fills the box with clothes books a clock a
radio a walkman and articles from the bathroom He examines
each closely like an artifactas if he might find some
message or meaning in them He fumbles them into the box He
cant see too well his eyes are full of tears

Maverick closes the box and carries it to the door He takes
one last glance around then leaves and closes the door
behind him

directions A quick glance at the souvenir shop the coffee
shop and then she heads for the bar

Maverick is there sitting alone in a booth with his
suitcase beside him staring into a drink Charlie composes
herself then walks to the booth and sits down across the
table from him Maverick does not look pleased

MAVERICK
I didnt want to see you I mean I
didbut I didnt

CHARLIE
I know exactly what you mean

MAVERICK
How could you

CHARLIE
Ive got a gift just like you do
My gift is I just know what people
mean even if they cant say it It
helps when youre trying to
communicate with fighter pilots
Like what you just said was Im
embarrassed I feel Ive done
something wrong that Ive failed
and I dont think I can live up to
the expectations of a wonderful
interesting intelligent woman like
yourself That about it

MAVERICK
(laughs)
Something like that

CHARLIE
And Im gonna sneak off and be by
myself for awhile like until I can
think of a new careerhotel
management or something

MAVERICK
Big talk for someone whos never
been shot off her computer

CHARLIE
Hey I never said I was a fighter
pilotI never claimed to think it

was fun to be shot off the end of a
ship in a storm I can find
contentment in a good book I dont
have to roar by someone at Mach two
with my hair on fire SometimesI
just get happy being with the right
man

MAVERICK
I hope you find him

CHARLIE
I think I have I could be wrong
I have been before Just remember
one thing If youre not Top Gun
if youre not fighting jets youre
not gonna be able to act like a
fighter pilot Youre gonna have
to act like the rest of us Youre
gonna have to master humility For
you guys thats the toughest
maneuver of all

She gets uplays a bill out for the drinks

CHARLIE
So long Sailor See you on the
beach sometime

She swings away Her wake sucks in the stares of every man
in the place Then they look over to Maverick quick flicks
of envy in their eyes He stares them back and cant quite
meet their eyes

106 EXT BEACH AT VIPERS HOUSE - LATER

Viper is tugged down the beach by a three year old kid They
come across one creature whos had a bad nightViper spots
him he spots Viper and Viper moves toward him Tim Vipers
kid wants to head for the sea and pulls his father in that
direction He stops puts his hand on his hips like hes seen
the pilots do

TIM
DadOf all the aminals in the
ocean which ones the baddest

VIPER
I dont know Tim Youll have to
ask them

Viper turns to the creature Maverick and shrugs

VIPER
Runs in the family

Maverick stands up

MAVERICK
Skipper sorry to bother you
VIPER
No bother

MAVERICK
I called your house

VIPER
My wifes house

MAVERICK
She said you took your kid to the
each Every second Sunday Zoo or
beach or the ballgame Yhave the
option (Maverick thinks for a
beat Segues to the question)
What about me

Viper turns they stroll together

VIPER
We can send you back to your
squadron with nothing noted on your
record except CNC --course not
completed no explanation required
Theoretically it doesnt hurt your
career but people always wonder
about things like that

MAVERICK

VIPER
Or you can quit

MAVERICK
I dont know

VIPER
I didnt know either Thats why I
told Jester to prepare your papers

Maverick looks irritated Viper stops at an icecream vendor
and orders three with a gesture

MAVERICK
Youve already made up your mind

VIPER
Its no disgrace kid That spin
was hell It would wreck anyones
confidence You could be a good
pilot again someday

MAVERICK
(starts to get his back up)
You think I should quit

VIPER
I didnt say that Thats up to
you But I have responsibility for
the other guys up there not just
you They need to know youre all
rightthat they can depend on
you

The vendor hands them icecream they take it

MAVERICK
Here let me get this Well be
even

He reaches into his pocket for change comes out with a
handful Slams it on the counter stars picking the proper
change out Viper spots something and reaches for
itMaverick sees and tries to block it but Viper comes up
with the Navy Cross

MAVERICK
Lucky charm

But Viper recognizes it for what it is

VIPER
Sometimes its luck but in this
case he earned it I served with
your old man

MAVERICK
I know

VIPER

VF 51 the Oriskany You remind me
of him Youre just like he was
only betterand worse

MAVERICK
Im nothing like him

VIPER
You may not think so but you are

MAVERICK
He was by the book all the way

VIPER
They waved him off He thought he
knew better He hit the
ramp

MAVERICK
I never heard that

VIPER
Not something they tell dependents

MAVERICK
Its not true

Viper looks at him for a long beat throws
away

VIPER
Why would I lie

He turns walks away Maverick stands there
thinking then catches up to him stops him
the thoughtas Viper breaks in

VIPER
You start on a wrong heading the
more you stick to it the further
you get from your target A good
pilot always questions himself
always questions his judgments
stays alert for drift and makes the
correctionsYou may find a little
discipline helps with the fear You
dont have to be alone up there

A pausequiet intensity

MAVERICK
How can I go on I feel so
responsible

VIPER

Kid the plain fact isyou are
Im not gonna stand here and blow
sunshine up your ass Technically
they absolved you You and I know
what really happened You pushed
it You are responsible and youll
always carry that You know what

his icecream

for a moment
Sstruggles with
Ill carry it too I should have
taken you out of that cockpit

I guess Im a hopeless romantic
I always try to find something
worthwhile in someones death Its
no trade-off Its not one for one
What you learned isnt worth his
death It couldnt be But maybe
there is some value in it I know
its the first thing Ive ever seen
thats really gotten to you Now
the question is what will you do
with it If it gets you out of
flight statusso you dont kill
yourself or anybody elsethats
good Thats one good thing You
were an accident waiting to

happen

MAVERICK
You think I shouldnt fly

VIPER
I didnt say that Thats up to
you I think that if you do if you
choose to come back youll be a
better pilot a better man

MAVERICK
Would you take me back Would they

VIPER
Ill have to think about it I
dont know about them I do know
one thing Weve got a lot invested
in you Wed hate to lose it Even
more than those other guys Naval

for position

Out-numbered four to two Maverick and Ice fight
defensively Maverick has the angle on a MIG when Fungus
spots a missile launch

FUNGUS
BREAK LEFT BREAK LEFT CHAFF

MAVERICK

BREAKING LEFT

Maverick releases a flare as he takes the F-14 into a hard
left The missile tracks the heat of the flare and sails out
of the area missing the Tomcat and falling toward the sea

ICE
TWO MIGS ON MY TAIL MAVERICK IM
DEFENSIVE

Maverick jerks his stick right and streaks toward Ice He
cuts off one of the MiGs with CANNON FIRE driving it down
toward the deck Ice goes into vertical and comes around to
gain an angle on the other MiG His RIO is in position to
check Mavs rear

and comes down like a comet A series of passes at the MiGs
As they come by one of the MiGs pulls up

MAVERICK

the sea He has the MiG in the diamond

ICE

ICE

through

Suddenly another MiG appears rocketing straight for him
They close at 900 knots--VABOOOM--They pass nose to nose
canopy to canopy Both planes pitch straight up trying for
the altitude advantage

MAVERICK
Zone 5 burners

The F-14 outclimbs the MiG sitting on its tail full
thruster it rockets straight up away from the planet
Maverick has the advantage Suddenly his F-14 runs out of
energy FUNGUS is the first to call it

FUNGUS
Were ballistic Ohhhhhh Shit

The plane backs down on itself backs into its own smoke as
it flips over falls awayHe catches it just regains
control whenA ROAR He looks up

SECOND MIG coming down Right on him It fills the Canopy
Instinctive - A Push to miss him Maverick breaks fast down
into him a last ditch maneuver and the airplane
DEPARTSthe roll rates and the pitch rates combine and it
tumbles over the top the airplane just goes end-over-end
They are being slammed and rattled all over the
cockpitsbone-jarring neck-snapping whips SHRIEKS and
SCREAMS from the airframe Terriflying

FUNGUS

Theyre in a progressive spiral nose low The altimeter
unwinds speed picks up The G forces are forcing them away
from the axis of spin jamming Maverick against the
instrument panel at the front of the cockpit

MAVERICK
You with me

Fungus also is jammed to his panel

FUNGUS
Right behind you

He is closer to the center of spin and less strongly held

It doesnt do much good however he cant control the plane
The only thing he can reach is the yellow and black loop the
ejection handle He reaches for it

FUNGUS
Speeds up to 150

Funguss eyes are wide The earth grows larger as it rises
towards them G forces flatten them Theyve long since lost
the MiG Nobody but an idiot would try to follow them in this
maneuver

FUNGUS
5000 feet Speed two hundred

MAVERICK
Okay

FUNGUS

FUNGUS grabs the ejection handle with both hands

MAVERICK
No Not again

FUNGUS

towards the ocean

gets control Fungus sits there dumbly hands on handle
Still not believing

FUNGUS

Maverick stops the tumble pulls the nose up quickly and the
F-14 sweeps into level flight no more than a hundred feet
above the deck He comes up and looks right at Ice Ice is
down low He comes around a MiG-21 all over him like a cheap
suit A flick a whip and Maverick in perfect position
rolls right in on the MiG Fungus looks like he just saw
Jesus

FUNGUS
