Laughter from the upperclassmen

COACH MILLER (contd)
But my philosophy is simple Hard work
and sacrifice
Theres a lot of basketball history and
pride here at USC but just putting on
the cardinal and gold doesnt make you a
great player Hard work and sacrifice
makes you a great player What you were
doesnt matter anymore For the first
time in your life you wont be the best
Youll be going up against women that are
bigger and stronger and better than you
ever imagined So the question is how
will you respond Well your answer
better be hard work and sacrifice because
thats the only way youre gonna make it
through Vince Lombardi preached it and
I teach it There is only one way to
succeed at anything and that is to give
everything

freshmen

Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in
Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions

Like her a lot of cockiness a lot of fear

COACH MILLER (contd)
A few simple rules Eleven oclock
curfew no exceptions Always be on
time no exceptions Attend every class
no exceptions No drugs no alcohol no
getting pregnant And finally respect
yourselves respect your coaches and
respect your teammates right Sidra

SIDRA senior point guard nods from the second row

Without emotion

table

MONICA

(she falls silent then)
I just saw Quincy

CAMILLE
How is he

MONICA
Engaged

CAMILLE

To that stewardess

MONICA
Yeah you met her

CAMILLE
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago

He could do a lot better if you ask me

MONICA
Maybe she is

Camille looks up studies Monica for a moment

CAMILLE
I thought you were over him

Monica shrugs

MONICA
So what do I do

CAMILLE
Find out where theyre registered and
send them a gift

MONICA
(disgusted)
Whatever

CAMILLE
You didnt want my opinion in the first

place so why even ask

MONICA
I asked but why does it always have to be
so damn prissy

CAMILLE
Dont curse

MONICA
There you go

CAMILLE

What do you want me to tell you Monica
to go beat that girl up To go have sex
with him Im not going to do that

Yes I believe thinking of other people
is important and yes Id rather bake a
pie than shoot a dumb jump shot If that
makes me too prissy for you too bad

Monica stares at her mother Theres no going back
MONICA

So thats why we cant get along
Because Id rather shoot a dumb jump

shot
CAMILLE
Youre the one always turning your nose
up at me
MONICA
No I dont
CAMILLE

Child please Ever since you were
little you thought you were too good for
anything I had to say

MONICA
I wasnt Lena I didnt care about nail
polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray
of your perfume

CAMILLE
What was so wrong with wanting to teach
you the things I knew could help you

MONICA
Because youre pushing me to be something
Im not

CAMILLE

So youre angry with me because youre
standing here with your hair combed and
wearing perfume

Monica is busted It takes her a moment to come back
MONICA
Im angry because I want a mother not
Martha Stewart

CAMILLE
Oh yes The superstar female athlete
whose mother is nothing but a housewife

MONICA
Thats not it

CAMILLE
Dont tell me you arent ashamed of that
because I know

Monica stares at her mother

MONICA
I remember when I was eight years old
you spent like four hours cooking up this
fancy meal All youd let me and Lena do
was set the table And I guess you and
Dad got your wires crossed or something
because he walks in with a couple of
pizzas And you didnt say anything
You just threw the whole meal into some
tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge

CAMILLE
I dont remember that

MONICA
I do You never stood up for yourself
Ever If I was ashamed it was because
of that

CAMILLE
Thats ridiculous

MONICA
Whats ridiculous is not being a caterer
so your husband can feel like a man
knowing his womans home cooking and
ironing his drawers

WHAP Camilles humiliation is immediate and she cuts off
Monica with a SLAP Camille curses herself for losing it

CAMILLE
Dammitt Monica

Monica is stunned hurt

MONICA
Im sorry

Camille stares at her daughter devastated
CAMILLE
Is that really all you think of me

Monica cant answer

CAMILLE (contd)
When I married your father all I wanted
was a nice house with a big kitchen so I
could start my catering business And
then I got pregnant with Lena and then I
got pregnant with you And I put it out
of my mind because thats what you did

Monica stares at her mother

CAMILLE (contd)
But you want to know what day I remember
In high school you getting ready for the
Spring Dance I put my pearls around
your neck told you you were beautiful
and you looked like you were going to
cry That day I was happy I didnt have
a catering business to run off to My
family had three meals a day had someone
to pick up after them and when my
daughters went to a dance I helped them
get ready Thats what I came to care
about

MONICA
(softly)
Thats all you cared about I must have
played in a thousand games and I can only
remember you being to two

CAMILLE
You had your coaches and your father for
that stuff It never mattered one way or
the other if I went to your games

MONICA
It mattered Mom

her eyes Monica moves off the barstool and leaves

QUINCY
What will this prove

MONICA
You once said the reason I beat you was

He grabs the rebound and lays it up He nods intensely as
he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key

QUINCY
One five Check

The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand using
his size and strength He scores seven straight points

The score stays close It is a sexually-charged battle of
wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt Their
bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball Monica yanks
off her jersey in frustration Her ass bumps into his hips
as she backs him in Her hands slide across his chest as she
guards him

Finally the score hits nine nine Monica slowly walks to
the top of the key

MONICA
Nine up Point

She tosses Quincy the ball

MONICA (contd)
Check

Quincy tosses the ball back drops low on defense Monica
fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites Monica drives around
him SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP SHE PUTS IT UPAND IT
ROLLS OFF THE RIM Monica cant believe it

Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it He stares at
Monica as he dribbles in front of her She stares back

He breaks for the basket Monica stays with him He goes
up Monica jumps desperately tries to block his shot
Quincy dunks on her knocking her to the ground He lets go
of the rim and tumbles to the ground also GAME OVER

Silence Quincy stares at her Monica looks back Then
QUINCY
(pointed)
Alls fair in love and basketball right

Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up
She slowly walks back toward her house And then

Monica slowly stops turns

QUINCY (contd)
Double or nothing

Monica stares at him wonders if she heard right Quincy
limps to his feet picks up the ball and holds it out to her
