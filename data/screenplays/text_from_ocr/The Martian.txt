The OXYGEN ALARM inside the helmet continues to BLARE And
just as it builds to crescendo

Mark Watney gasps for air

He jerks back into consciousness He’s disoriented alarms
BLARING inside his helmet As he struggles to move

He screams in pain Glances down Sees
A JAGGED LENGTH OF ANTENNA has pierced his spacesuit and

stabbed straight into his abdomen CAKED BLOOD all around
the wound

Mark’s training kicks in -- the suit is breached -- he
struggles to his knees -- gasping in pain -- he reaches to
the side of his helmet for the BREACH KIT -- pulls the valve
free -- grabs hold of the antenna grits his teeth

AND YANKS the antenna out of his side The antenna SNAPS
FREE -- the suit is exposed to atmosphere -- the pressure
inside DROPS -- Mark CRIES OUT goes woozy --

WINCES as he rips the blood-caked fabric away from HIS WOUND

His fingers probe the puncture It’s deep That’s bad He
checks his back for an exit wound There’s none That’s
good He grabs the broken antenna he brought with him His
fingers trace the bloodied end It’s jagged -- as though a
piece of the antenna broke off inside him

That’s really bad

Mark stumbles over to the first-aid station Grabs supplies
Anesthetic Syringe Forceps Needle Suture thread

(This is not exactly going to be easy towatch)

Sweat pouring off his brow Mark loads up the syringe with
anesthetic Grits his teeth Injects it into his wound
Gasps Breathes Grabs the forceps Hesitates JI don’t
want to do this He takes a deep breath

And digs the forceps into his wound

He CRIES OUT in painNearly goes unconscious Fights it
Don’t pass out Mark He probes with the forceps grimacing
in agony He can’t find it Pushes the forceps in deeper
And DEEPER Jesus Mark’s face goes WHITE

He finds it Yanks the forceps free Sees the small piece
of shrapnel It’s out Hallelujah

Mark grabs the needle Tries to thread it His hands won’t
stop shaking He makes fists C’mon Mark Steadies himself
just enough

He begins to stitch himself up Bit by agonizing bit His
hands keep shaking but he refuses to stop until the wound is
closed Finally

He’s done He clips the sutures Collapses back into his
chair Oh Jesus Tries to catch his breath

We slowly ANGLE IN ON MARK as he struggles to breathe and
breathe

And as we settle into a CLOSEUP we see the full realityof

has ever happened from lighting hydrogen

Of course I’m afraid of a PR problem

reimburse us for a paper clip if we puta

Watney’s family is high

He knows this sounds cold but he’s out of options
VINCENT (CONT’D)
Ares 6 could bring the body back We
don’t say that’s the purpose of the

be part of it We frame it that way we
get more support in Congress I can sell

Plugged it into the Hab to recharge
It’s been moved

It’s been taken apart There’s no way
they do that without telling us

understands what it means

No If Watney is really alive we
don’t want the Ares 3 crew to know

ANNIE
What How can you not tell them

TEDDY
They have another ten months on their

We need them alert and undistracted

And they’d be devastated to find out they
abandoned him alive

We have to protect the crew There’s
nothing they can do anyway Let them
deal with the emotional trauma when
they’ re not trapped in a spaceship

How do we handle the public

We have twenty-four hours before we’re
required to release the pics

A CNN REPORTER conducts an interview with Vincent in the NASA
MEDIA ROOM Annie watches like a nervous stage mom

VINCENT

He’s conducting incremental tests --
taking Rover 2 out for longer and longer
trips each time

To what end Why would he leave the
relative safety of the Hab

VINCENT

travel to the Ares 4 launch site in order
to make contact with us But it would be
a dangerous gamble

REPORTER 3
He’d be risking his life to talk to you

This is the problem Mark faces He’s
alone And he needs to make contact to
survive But if we could talk to him
we’d tell him to stay put Mark needs to
trust we’re doing everything in our power
to bring him home alive

I’m going to make everyone forget there’s

he does we begin ANGLING towards the carbon-thread canvas
lining the side of the airlock

As the depressurization process begins the canvas starts to
STRETCH

And the sheet RIPS

the length of the airlock --

The full force of the Hab’s atmosphere rushes through the
breach

He looks through the window Sees the collapsed Hab The
debris of ruined equipment scattering the field between them

Struggles out of his suit Checks his wounds He’s alive

Psssssshhhhhhhh

What the hell is that sound

The airlock is leaking

Mark’s heart starts to pound He searches frantically for
the leak checking every seam every inch of fabric

Psssssshhhhhhhh

keep him alive For now But he has to find that leak

Think Watney How do you find an invisibleleak

He does an inventory He has his toolkit He has the patch
kit from his suit Think Watney

He pulls the knife out of the toolkit
And cuts his own hair
He hacks a chunk clean out of it Holds the loose hair
tight Then he goes back to the arm computer BOOSTS the

Yanks the WIRES from the power generator free Strips the
casing Here goes nothing

He holds the wires in the oxygen flow rubs them together to
create a SPARK WHOOSH He lights the hair on fire
creating the key to his plan

towards the floor

Heading right through the microscopic TEAR in the fabric

that old stalwart of every NASA space mission Ducttape

He tears a piece free Seals the hole The hissing stops

Mark cuts off one of the arms from his EVA suit Cuts it
into one square piece Opens the patch kit Works fast to

glue the square over the area where the faceplate used to be

Then glues the arm-hole shut

NASA rejected the idea They’d rather
take a big risk on Watney than a small
risk on all of us Whoever snuck it in
Vogel’s email obviously disagreed

MARTINEZ
So We’re talking about going directly
against NASA’s decision

LEWIS
Yes If we do the maneuver they’11l have
to send the supply ship or we’ll die We
have the opportunity to force their hand

JOHANSSEN
Are we gonna do it

Isn’t it Up to you I mean

Not this time This is something NASA
expressly rejected We’re talking about
mutiny Which is not a word I use
lightly We do this together or not at
all Before you answer consider the
consequences If we mess up the supply
rendezvous we die If we mess up the
Earth gravity assist we die If we do
everything perfectly we add 533 days to

our families again 533 days of
unplanned space travel where anything
could go wrong Something might break

critical we die

LEWIS
Can you disable it

JOHANSSEN
Hermes has four redundant flight
computers each connected to three
redundant comm systems We can’t shut
down the comms we’d lose telemetry and
guidance We can’t shut down the
computers we need to control the ship
I’d have to disable the Remote Override
on each system It’s part of the OS
I’d have to jump over the code

It has to be unanimous If anyone says
no that’s it We go home as planned
But I vote yes

Okay we’re gonna start by stating for
the record that you’re not gonna like
this

Vincent starts to look through the plans

The Martian Shooting Script

MITCH
The problem is the intercept velocity
The Hermes cannot enter Mars orbit or
they’ 11 never have enough fuel to make it
home The MAV is only designed to get to
Low Mars Orbit So in order for Mark to
escape Mars’ gravity entirely and
intercept the Hermes

VINCENT
He needs to be going fast

BRUCE
(nods)
Which means we need to make the MAV
lighter A lot lighter Five-thousand
kilograms lighter

VINCENT
You can do that

Bruce gives him a look that says well that depends on your definition of “do that”
Vincent He begins to deconstruct a scale
model of the MAV

BRUCE
There were some gimmes right off the bat
The design presumes 500 kilograms of
Martian soil and samples Obviously we
won’t do that

MITCH
There’s just one passenger instead of
six With suits and gear that saves
another 500 Then we ditch the life
support We don’t need it We’1l have
Watney use his EVA suit for the whole
trip

VINCENT
How will he use the controls

MITCH
He won’t Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the Hermes

VINCENT
We’ ve never had a manned ship controlled
remotely before
(off Mitch’s look)
But I’m excited for the opportunities
that affords

If we go remote we can lose the control
panels Then we dump the secondary and
tertiary comm systems

You’re going to have a remote controlled
ascent with no backup comms

We have to remove the nose airlock the
windows and Hull Panel 19

(what)

Youre taking the front of the ship off

kilograms

You’re going to launch a man into space
with a giant hole in the front of the
ship

BRUCE
Well no We’re gonna have him cover
it with Hab canvas

Vincent puts his head in his hands

BRUCE (CONT’D)
The hull’s mostly there to keep the air
in Mars’ atmosphere is so thin you
don’t need a lot of streamlining By the
time the ship’s going fast enough for air
resistance to matter it’1ll be high
enough that there’s practically no air

at 5 meters per second 10 is like

point and velocity

discussed in the history of space travel no manned ship has ever accelerated with more
force

INT MAV - DAY

Mark can’t even GASP -- the wind knocked out of him -- He
struggles to remain conscious as the ship shakes VIOLENTLY --

MARK’S POV staring forward at the HAB CANVAS (which now
patches where the nosecone used to be)

As the ship accelerates the canvas begins to RIP --

JOHANSSEN
Velocity 741 meters per second Altitude

LEWIS
That’s too low --
MARTINEZ
I know It’s fighting me --
JOHANSSEN
Velocity 850 altitude 1843 --
LEWIS
Watney Watney do you read Can you
report
INT MAV - DAY
But Mark’s barely conscious -- his eyes drifting from

terrified to serene as he fades --

HIS POV -- the canvas RIPS FREE

Revealing the RED ATMOSPHERE of Mars And as it thins -- as
we rocket towards the heavens -- the red gives way to the
black

And the last thing Mark sees before he drops unconscious --
Are the STARS

INT HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

JOHANSSEN
He’s well below target altitude
LEWIS
How far below

Watney Do you read

BECK (OVER COMMS)
He’s probably passed out He pulled 12
G’s on the ascent Give hima few
minutes

LEWIS
Copy

JOHANSSEN
I have interval pings Intercept
velocity will be 11 meters per second

BECK (OVER COMMS)
I can make that work

JOHANSSEN
Distance at intercept will be --
(goes pale)
We’1l be 68 kilometers apart

INT HERMES - AIRLOCK 2 - SPACE

BECK
Did she say 68 kilometers Kilometers

INT HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

MARTINEZ
Oh my god

LEWIS
Keep it together Work the problem
Martinez do we have any juice inthe
MAV

MARTINEZ
Negative Commander They ditched the
OMS system to make launch weight

LEWIS
Then we have to go him Johanssen time
to intercept

JOHANSSEN
39 minutes 12 seconds --

LEWIS
What if we point our attitude thrusters
all the same direction

MARTINEZ
Depends on how much fuel we want to save
for attitude adjustments on the trip
home

The Martian Shooting Script 100

LEWIS
How much do you need

MARTINEZ
I could get by with maybe 20 percent of
what’s left

LEWIS
Johanssen --

JOHANSSEN
(already working it)
Use 755 percent of remaining attitude
adjust fuel That’1l bring the intercept
range to zero

LEWIS
Do it
JOHANSSEN
Hang on -- that gets the range to zero

but the intercept velocity will be 42
meters per second --

LEWIS
Then we have 39 minutes to figure out how
to slow down Martinez burn the jets
EXT HERMES - SPACE

WHOOSH The attitude thrusters FIRE The Hermes changes
course --

INT MAV - DAY

CLOSE ON MARK as his eyelids flutter He winces in pain as
he slowly regains consciousness

BENEATH HIM -- the orbiting MAV offers an unobstructed view
of Mars The great red planet’s horizon stretches out
forever as the wispy atmosphere gives it a fuzzy edge

It’s breathtaking Awe-inspiring

Mark holds up his middle finger Fuck you Mars

MARK
Affirmative Commander

The Martian Shooting Script

LEWIS (OVER COMMS)
What’s your status

MARK
My chest hurts I think I broke some
ribs
(then)
How are you

LEWIS (OVER COMMS)
We’ re working on getting you There was
a complication during launch

MARK
Yeah The canvas didn’t hold

INT HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

MARK (OVER COMMS)
I think it ripped early in the ascent

LEWIS
That’s consistent with what we saw

MARK (OVER COMMS)
How bad is it Commander

LEWIS
We’ ve corrected the intercept range but
weve got a problem with the intercept
velocity

MARK (OVER COMMS)
How big a problem

LEWIS
42 meters per second

INT MAV - DAY
We’ re CLOSE ON MARK as that news lands

MARK
Well Shit

INT HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

Everyone struggles to find a solution Mark’s voice
interrupts the silence

MARK (OVER COMMS)
Commander
The Martian Shooting Script 102

INT MAV - DAY

LEWIS (OVER COMMS)
Go ahead Mark

MARK
I could find something sharp in here and
poke a hole in the glove of my EVAsuit
I could use the escaping air as a
thruster and fly my way to you Since
the source is on my arm I could direct
it pretty easy

INT HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

LEWIS
I can’t see you having any control if you
did that You’d be eyeballing the
intercept and using a thrust vector you
can barely control

MARK (OVER COMMS)
Those are very good points But
Consider this

INT MAV - DAY

MARK
I would get to fly around like Iron Man

INT HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

LEWIS
We should have left him on Mars

MARK (OVER COMMS)
Iron Man Commander Iron Man

Lewis rubs her face Thinks Hmm

LEWIS
Maybe it’s not the worst idea
MARTINEZ
No it actually is The worst idea
Ever
LEWIS
Not his part But using atmosphere as
thrust

(springs into action)
Martinez get Vogel’s station up and
running

The Martian Shooting Script

MARTINEZ
It’s up What do you need

LEWIS
I need to know what happens if we blow
the VAL

Both Martinez and Johanssen straighten up What

MARTINEZ

You want to open the Vehicular Airlock

LEWIS
It would give us a good kick

MARTINEZ

Yeah And it might blow the nose of the

ship off in the process

JOHANSSEN
And all the air would leave And we
need air To not die

LEWIS
We’1l1 seal the bridge and reactor room
We let everywhere else go vacuo

MARTINEZ
But we’d still have the same problem as
Watney We can’t direct the thrust

LEWIS
We don’t have to The VAL is in the
nose We just point the ship at Mark

MARTINEZ
(reading the numbers)

A breach at the VAL would decelerate us

29 meters per second

JOHANSSEN

Which gives us a relative velocity of 13

meters per second

LEWIS
Beck -- you hearing this

INT HERMES - FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

MARTINEZ
How do we open the airlock doors

There’s no way to open them remotely and

if anyone’s nearby when it blows

The Martian Shooting Script

LEWIS
Right right
(thinks)
Vogel

VOGEL (OVER COMMS)
Go ahead Commander

LEWIS
Take your suit off
(then)

I need you to come back in and makea
bomb

Did you say “bomb” You guys are making
a bomb without me

INT HERMES - AIRLOCK 2 - SPACE

VOGEL
Um Again please Commander

LEWIS (OVER COMMS)
You’re the chemist Can you make a bomb
with what we’ve got on board

VOGEL
Probably But I feel obliged to
mention that setting off an explosive
device on a spacecraft is a terrible
terrible idea

LEWIS (OVER COMMS)
Copy that Can you do it

VOGEL
(thinks then)
Ja

INT MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
