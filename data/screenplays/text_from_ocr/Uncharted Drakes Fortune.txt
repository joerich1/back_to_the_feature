BRITISH FLAGSHIP THE DEFIANCE
3000 MILES WEST OF CHILE - SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN
MARCH 13TH 1597

EXT THE DEFIANCE - BRIDGE - DAY

A grey fog so thick we can only see the forward half of
the ship From over the gunwale a pair of CREW HANDS
drop a canvas wrapped DEAD BODY into the sea

The CREW shares conspiratorial glances haggard from
malnourishment and months at sea They arm themselves

CUT TO
THE MAP

An intricate hand drawn sea map held down by cannonballs
In fact beyond intricate It is incomprehensible Lines
dots and arrows go to and fro without so much as a word
written on it We pull back to reveal

INT CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - DAY

Standing over the map is SIR FRANCIS DRAKE Hardly
the stiff-necked aristocrat he is as rough as his crew
with the bedroom eyes of a rogue

SEA HAND 1 (0S)
Captain Drake Crew would have a word

Sir Francis turns to see the angry crew standing at his
door He picks up his pipe and a match unconcerned

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
Would you Just one

SEA HAND 2
Fourteen ships lost Quarter rations for
months and the stores as bare as Adam

SEA HAND 1
And even the navigator has no idea where
we lie

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
The Queen herself has given us this
mission and I’ve sworn an oath to its
secrecy
SEA HAND 2
Stuff the Queen And stuff your oath Sir
You lead us to death as sure as the
sirens do

Sir Francis stays calm Amused even

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
And I take it you propose an alternate
course of action

SEA HAND 1
We propose to turn this ship around

Sir Francis strikes a match supremely calm He lights
his pipe and takes a long drag

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
Over my rotting corpse

SEA HAND 2
As you decide Captain

Up come the swords and knives Sir Francis delivers a
vicious KICK to one of the barrels that forms a leg for
his map table

BLACK POWDER POURS OUT of the hole he created The crew
realizes it is a KEG OF GUNPOWDER As are the other three
legs of the table Everyone freezes

Sir Francis holds the lit match over the spilling powder
Sir Francis still grins as he addresses his terrified
men himself as calm as a cucumber

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
Now you listen to me you faithless dogs
We will not turn We will not tarry We
are the finest crew ever to sail Gods
blue We will go onward or we will go to
hell But I’1l bargain with the devil
himself before I turn tail from such
treasure as we’re after

Suddenly something lands on the window ledge behind Sir
Francis A BIRD Everyone seems shocked except Drake

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE (CONT’D)
Land ho lads Man the guns
INT DEFIANCE - GUN DECK - DAY

Below deck the cannon doors are yanked open gun crews
shouldering their cannons into firing position Peering
out hoping for some sign of good fortune

EXT ISLA OCCULTA - SPANISH PORT CITY - DAY

The Defiance emerges from the thick fog into a wide
lagoon surrounding a partially sunken Spanish port city
Huge cracks splinter the fort’s foundations and black
powder marks abound

Though the crew waits tensely for an alarm None comes
No one and nothing moves save an oddly swirling GREEN
MIST that eddies about the fort

SCOUT (0S)
Ship ho

Up ahead a HALF SUNKEN GALLEON crests like shattered
mountain from the surface of the lagoon

INTEXT HALF-SUNKEN GALLEON - DAY

Prow down only her poop deck and mizzenmast rise above
the water Sir Francis and his FIRST MATE stand on the
ruined ship’s deck carefully examining her wreckage

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
Any clues to who sunk her I’d like to
know who beat me to the task

One of the Sea Hands joins them from the hold below
SEA HAND
The cannon holes I found shatter out

cap’n They sunk her themselves

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
What

SAILOR (0S)
Found the captain

SPANISH EPAULET
Covered with blood and gore it’s about the only

recognizable thing on the shredded body of the SPANISH
CAPTAIN
SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
Not a captain An Admiral That’s
Alvarado What’s left of him

FIRST MATE
Did -- did something eat his face

Suddenly A FIGURE whisks past the window outside All
the men draw their muskets

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
Something that’s still here

SUBMERGED HOLD

Sir Francis and his men creep through the knee high
water guns drawn The cavernous space is pockmarked with
blood stains and powder blasts of a battle

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
(in Spanish subtitled)
Surrender yourself friend We are not
after you Just your queens gold

Suddenly a DARK FORM leaps out ripping through the Sea
Hand There’s a flurry of tearing sounds as Drake and his
men turn to shoot

SIR FRANCIS DRAKE (CONT’D)
May the Lord have mercy upon our souls

BLAM We hear the sound of GUNFIRE as we PULL UP from the
half-sunken galleon to reveal the entire lagoon -- and an
ENTIRE FLEET OF SPANISH SHIPS sunk beneath its surface

CUT TO

AERIAL SHOT - FAVELA VIDIGAL - DAY

We soar over a dense Brazilian slum perched vertically
on the side of a cliff overlooking a pristine beach
dotted with five star hotels

RIO DE JANEIRO BRAZIL
FAVELA VIDIGAL
TODAY

The aerial shot comes to rest on a battered dilapidated
wooden structure hanging out over the cliff precariously
We move through an open window and into --
INT BAR CONRADO - DAY

Lazy ceiling fans barely stir the air Rough PATRONS
populate the run-down bar playing dominos running
women or simply nursing their drinks

With his back to the window we came in we find NATHAN
DRAKE (30s) Grungy T-shirt jeans he’s the only gringo
in the place but nobody takes him for an easy mark He’s
got the supreme confidence of a man who’s figured all the
angles and the eyes of a guy who’s seen it all

Sitting down at the other side of the table is ATOQ
NAVARRO (30s) Of Mestizo Indian descent he sports a
knife scar on his left cheek and a scowl to match it on
the right Two of Navarro’s MESTIZO THUGS (20s) huge
guys with stone monuments for faces stand flanking him

NAVARRO
Remind me to pick the place next time

NATE
It’s a hidden gem You gotta try Paulo’s
Moqueca He does something with the
plantains -- it’s unbelievable

NAVARRO
I’m not hungry You brought the cash

NATE
That depends You brought the map

Another of Navarro’s THUGS steps into the bar making a
beeline for Navarro He whispers in his ear

THUG
(in a local dialect)
Its not in his room or on the boat He
must have it with him

From the thug’s jacket Navarro pulls a map case He
gingerly unfurls the map on the crude wooden table

It is a sailing map hand drawn antique WE RECOGNIZE IT
AS SIMILAR TO SIR FRANCIS’ STRANGELY MARKED MAP Nate
pours over the map his eyes filled with excitement

NAVARRO
I was surprised when I found out you were
looking for this one Hardly a remarkable
item No attribution No location Not
even a date on it May I ask what you
think it is
NATE
Ask away

Navarro smiles Nate’s not about to let on what he knows
Nate leans down closer to the map inspecting closely

And when he does a narrow rawhide cord around his neck
spills out from under his shirt And on that cord an old
SILVER RING

Navarro’s eyes go right to it mesmerized

NATE (CONTD)
It’s genuine I was expecting you to try
and sell me a fake

He reaches around his waist pulling out a transparent
money belt ringed with stacks of hundred dollar bills

Navarro raises a finger His thugs draw their pistols

NAVARRO
Never old friend

Nate straightens up cash in hand only to be staring
down the barrel of three guns

NATE
Problem old friend

NAVARRO
More like a wrinkle Instead of getting
the map why don’t you give me the key

NATE
Key What key

NAVARRO
The ring around your neck The one that
can interpret the map

Nate smiles

NATE
Atoq you shifty bastard You know more
than you’re letting on

NAVARRO
Maybe a little Nathan Turns out we may
be looking for the same thing is all And
despite how you amuse me my employer
likes to keep his overhead low

His men cock their pistols
NATE
You should know I’m not just going to
walk away from this one I spent half my
life trying to find this

NAVARRO
Is that so Strange Because this is more
than just business for me as well

Nate SNAPS his fingers GUNS COCKING Navarro sees eight
of the TOUGHS around the bar leveling guns at them

NATE
You know the great thing about favelas
Labor costs Can’t get a better deal on
gunmen in this day and age

NAVARRO
How much did you pay them

NATE
About fifty US

NAVARRO
That was always your problem Nate You
never had enough money to do it right
That’s why I offered them a hundred

Nate’s smile drops He realizes all the guns are pointed
at him He singles out the bartender PAULO

NATE
Really Paulo You too

PAULO
Sorry Senor Nate but with the
recession

NATE
Unbelievable

Suddenly Nate slips and falls or so it seems Actually
he drops down on his back hands positioned behind his
head so he can --

KICK the underside of the table up and into Navarro’s
face splintering it The two halves of the table
continue upward and hit the pistols of Navarro’s men
deflecting them as they fire

Their shots narrowly miss a rolling Nate But their
bullets rip apart the dropped money belt revealing it’s
mostly filled with just FOLDED PAPER
Meanwhile the MAP which was on the table that was
kicked into the air gets caught on the rotating blade of
one of the lazy ceiling fans

The thugs shift aim as Nate rolls under corner of the bar
and out of view He pulls out his two silver plated nine
millimeter pistols from behind his back The thugs spread
out looking for an angle where they can see him

Nate pops up and unleashes three quick shots dropping
back down behind cover before anyone can shoot back

THE REST OF THE BAR

Navarro looks around at his men trying to see if any are
hit All are still standing Navarro smiles

NAVARRO
Want me to show you how to use those

Then all three of his thugs sway and drop dead

NATE
I’m good thanks

Navarro WHISTLES Into the bar come SIX MORE THUGS these
ones armed with submachine guns Navarro points out
Nate’s location at the far end of the bar

Paulo sees the submachine guns aimed his way

PAULO
NO

He hits the floor just as AUTOMATIC FIRE carves up the
far end of the bar and the wall behind it

Nate stares through the swiss cheese holes in the bar
his eyes connecting with Paulo similarly prone

NATE
Can we agree you made a mistake Paulo

Paulo doesn’t respond terrified And then Nate sees the
reason why PAULO’S WIFE is huddled over a tortilla press
on the floor just on the other side of the bar from Nate
The automatic fire missed her head by inches

The thugs adjust aim to fire again at Nate Paulo’s eyes
voice a silent plea

NATE (CONTD)
Wait Wait
Nate dives AWAY from cover He crosses the nearly empty
bar floor AUTOMATIC FIRE chewing at his heels almost
catching up --

When Drake throws his legs ahead of his body in a drop
kick knocking over the lone standing table in the room
giving him mere inches of cover as the bullets catch up
with him They eat up the table and one gets through and
catches Nate in the arm

He winces in pain Navarro smiles holding the money belt
filled with blank paper

NAVARRO
Just another gringo coming to rip off the
natives eh Nate I suppose that’s what
I’m to expect from a street rat like you

Nate searches for some means of escape Behind him the
rear wall is swiss cheese He FIRES two more bullets and
a large chunk of the wall falls away

A gust of wind blows through the large hole It LIFTS THE
MAP off the blade of the fan pulling it to the opening
It wasn’t what Nate had planned on

NATE
No

Navarro sees what Nate saw

NAVARRO
Hijo de puta

Nate jumps out from behind the table racing for the map
Navarro and his men shift aim The map flutters out the
hole but Nate DIVES out the hole after it into mid-air
For a beat Navarro and the thugs listen for a
bloodcurdling scream or some loud collision None come
They race to the window Nothing but a hundred foot drop
to the beach No sign of Nate

CREAK A board beneath Navarro shifts WE HURTLE

UNDER THE BAR

With the map in his teeth Nate hangs on for dear life to
a lone support beam jutting out of the steep hillside

BACK IN THE BAR

Navarro looks down at the cracks between the wooden floor
slats He catches a glimpse of shadow moving down there

NAVARRO (CONTD)
He’s below

The thugs shift their aim and unleash a fusillade of
lead chewing up the floor

UNDER THE BAR
Gun in one hand wooden beam in the other and map still
in his teeth Nate can only watch as the bullets chew up
the support beam he’s holding The bullets rain down
The support beam cracks and splinters
NATE
(map in his teeth)
Thish ish gonna hurt

The beam snaps and the entire structure starts to lean
MOANING as it teeters toward oblivion

BACK IN THE BAR
The floor of half the bar curves downward Navarro dives
onto the structurally sound part of the bar but two of

Navarro’s thugs aren’t so lucky

CRACK Half of the bar rips apart from the other half and
dangles over the cliff face

UNDER THE BAR

Nate lets go of the beam He freefalls Twenty feet below
he slams into a tin roof

INT TIN SHACK - CONTINUOUS

SLAM Nate hits the bamboo floor hard shards of the tin
roof everywhere

Just then Nate looks up his eyes going wide in fear He
dives three feet to his left --

AS HALF THE BAR COMES CRASHING DOWN ON TOP OF HIM NATE
PULLS HIS ARMS AND LEGS INTO HIS BODY MAKING HIS PROFILE
AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE AND HE PASSES HARMLESSLY THROUGH AN
OPEN WINDOW OF THE FALLING BAR

INTEXT DESTROYED BAR SECTION - CONTINUOUS

Now inside the remains of the bar he comes face to face
with the two thugs who slowly rise CREAK CRACK

NATE
Oh no

The hillside gives way and the destroyed bar continues
sliding down the hill plowing through every obstacle in
its way All three men try to balance on the undulating
floor like they’re on an immense surfboard

The thugs train their weapons on Nate Nate’s guns are in
their holsters He takes a deep breath

THUG
Adios imbecile

SUDDENLY A TELEPHONE POLE shoots through wall behind
Nate flying at the thugs causing them to duck When
they come back up all they see is Nate holding a rung of
the pole using its momentum to carry him into them

Nate kicks one thug in the face and tackles the second

The remains of the bar drop another twenty feet landing
on a steep grassy slope where it picks up speed

Nate’s slammed hard against the floor The thug above him
swings his gun around Nate pushes off a wall launching
himself at a thug just as he FIRES The bullet misses
Nate by inches Nate swings his feet ahead and they land
in the thug’s chest --

Catapulting him out the open window of the bar

EXT THE BAR ABOVE - CONTINUOUS

At the edge of the broken bar Navarro sees one of his
guys fly out of the bar and get crushed by it

It slides toward the bottom of the cliff where a PHOTO
SHOOT is taking place at a resort pool

Navarro gets on his phone
NAVARRO
(subtitled Paez)
Hes headed for the resort
EXT RESORT POOL - DAY

VIDEO POV

A beautiful lagoon pool complete with a waterfall BIKINI
MODELS pose around the foliage

And in front of the cameras a polished SUV and ELENA
FISHER (late 20s) Elena is a beautiful woman a tan
blonde in a white bikini She’s enough of a pro to not
let on she hates this current assignment

ELENA
This is Elena Fisher for Adventure TV
Today well be diving off the coast of
Brazil with some of the world’s top
swimwear models sponsored by the all new
2010 Cadillac Escalade

DIRECTOR (0S)
And -- CUT

Elena’s smile drops She walks over to the video village
and watches the playback with the DIRECTOR and PRODUCERS

ELENA
Come on guys There’s a C-stand in the
background and a flare off the fender

The DIRECTOR sighs audibly and heads over to the crew

DIRECTOR
Guys there’s a C-Stand in the shot

Elena grabs her IPHONE and heads to the craft service
table KARL (40s) her agent and friend joins her

ELENA
Remind me how this is part of the plan

KARL
This increases your on-camera experience
And it ups your visibility

ELENA
So does porn

KARL
I can set that audition

ELENA
You’re an awful agent You know that
don’t you

KARL
Just hang in there kid Everyone’s got
to pay their dues

ELENA
Really What dues did Wolf Blitzer pay

KARL
He hosted Supermarket Sweep for its first
two seasons

Elena’s eyes narrow not believing it for a second

KARL (CONTD)
Wolfie did the indie journalist route
Broke some story on human rights
violations and that was his calling card

ELENA
What a whore

SMASH The pulverized remains of the bar tumbles into the
pool The models scream

Nate bursts out of the water causing the models to
SCREAM again He puts his guns away fixes his hair and
walks right for Elena

NATE
Afternoon

A thug erupts out of the foliage FIRING A bullet
whizzes inches from Elena’s face Nate launches himself
in a flying tackle and breaks the thug’s arm badly The
gun drops to the deck Nate head butts him unconscious

Suddenly more THUGS rush out of the foliage Nate grabs
the phone out of Elena’s hand

NATE (CONT’D)
Sorry Emergency

Nate jumps in the polished Cadillac Escalade and
disappears as his head ducks beneath the dash

ELENA
It doesn’t have keys

The Escalade starts up Nate hot-wired it in six seconds
He revs the engine and the Escalade peels out Navarro’s
thugs give chase leaving everyone else shell shocked
Elena stares after him less shocked than the others and
more intrigued

EXT DOCK —- DAY

Nate pulls up in the Escalade leaving it running He
gets out racing down the dock His ear is to the phone

NATE
Sully It’s me I got the Drake map I’m
headed to the trawler Take the plane and
I’1l text you the coordinates

Nate races for the DIVE TRAWLER anchored at the far end --
WHEN IT SUDDENLY EXPLODES The blast wave knocks Nate
clear off the dock and into the water

CUT TO

INT DRYDOCK - NIGHT

MALCOM (20s) Jamaican uses a dirty rag to wipe engine
oil off his hands as he opens a supply closet

Inside looking like a drowned rat is Nate

MALCOM
No

NATE
I’m in a real tight spot here

Nate steps out of the closet bringing with him a duffel
bag he kept stashed there

MALCOM
That wouldn’t be why there are big guys
with guns prowling around my shop would
it

NATE
I need a boat

MALCOM
I just fixed ya boat

Nate WINCES as he removes a piece of shrapnel from his
shoulder He pulls gauze from his duffel for the wound

NATE
And now it’s at the bottom of the bay I
thought you guarantee your work

MALCOM
I guarantee if my clients pay

NATE
I told you I’m gonna get you the money
But see that’s where I need your help
I need a boat A dive trawler

(MORE )

NATE (CONTD)
If I don’t get out of here before those
guys find me I can’t get you your money
see

MALCOM
No I don’t see Nat’an you a liar anda
cheat and I’1l have nothing more ta do
wicha Have you noticed all the bad
‘tings happenin’ in your life lately
You’re cursed Nat’an Judged by the good
Lord himself He tellin’ you to change
your ways But you ain’t gonna change

NATE
I’1l take a dingy with a winch

MALCOM
Won’t help Can’t help There’s only one
dive trawler in the bay and that lady
with the film crew’s got it rented out
for the rest of the week

Nate smiles gears turning He closes the first aid kit

NATE
Really

EXT RESORT - RESTAURANT BALCONY - NIGHT

An elegant restaurant balcony candlelit tables the
moon’s reflection glistening in an undulating ocean

Elena sits at a table in the far corner of the balcony
looking at the screen of her brand new iPhone

Suddenly Nate appears He’s wearing a sport jacket He
even shaved Cleans up pretty good when he needs to He
sits down across from her and slides her phone to her
Now she has two

NATE
Thanks for loaning me your phone Oh
your car’s down by the dock

ELENA
Not anymore The police said someone left
it unlocked With the engine running
It’s probably entering Paraguay by now

NATE
Suriname The big auto theft ring
operates out of Suriname
ELENA
And you’re a man who knows such things

NATE
I’m a man who knows such things

The WAITER appears with two drinks He sets a drink in
front of Elena and a beer in front of Nate Elena’s
surprised but tries to hide it She takes a sip

ELENA
Mojito You know what I drink

NATE
Do I

ELENA
All right You’ve made your approach
Youve bought me a drink Now would be
when you tell me a story Ooh I know
Tell the one where the men with machine
guns try and murder you

NATE
Sorry Most of that is confidential

ELENA
Of course I’ll just be too intrigued and
have to pursue you for the information
And oh so slowly I’1l1 pry it out of you
despite great reluctance Because for
some reason maybe it’s the moon maybe
the drinks but tonight you find me
irresistible

Nate extends a hand across the table Elena takes it

NATE
Nate Mysterious stranger

ELENA
Elena Intrigued reporter Can I ask you
a question

NATE
I was hoping you would

She leans in Nate leans in as well She motions with a
finger beckoning him closer She whispers in his ear

ELENA
What do you want with my boat

Nate’s smile and assurance crack He’s shocked and it
takes him a moment too long to try and hide it

NATE
Your -- your boat
ELENA
I mean -- a dive trawler blew up right

near where you left the Escalade and
those men with machine guns were crawling
all over the docks Did I make an
incorrect assumption that you might be
looking for a replacement boat

Just the hint of a smile She’s playing him

NATE
Oh You’re good You’re very good

ELENA

Thank you I am aware So weve
established I’ve got a boat What is it
you’re prepared to pony up for barter

(Nate flashes his smile)
And please realize that your charm and
the pleasure of your company while very
nice I’m sure are not what I’m in the
market for

Nate furrows his brow This isn’t going the way he
planned but he’s quick enough on his feet

NATE
You seem like the kind of woman who
doesn’t go to the bathroom without a
plan I’m guessing this conversation
would’ve ended before your mojito arrived
if you didn’t know exactly what you want
from me

Elena nods He’s got her there

ELENA
Everybody wants something from everybody
right I’m a reporter You’re a guy being
chased by men with machine guns What do
you think I want

Nate smiles broadly A deal is struck

LATER

Several dishes lie partially touched A wine bottle 34
empty Elena and Nate both lean in close to the lone
candle illuminating them

NATE
At 16 he made his first transatlantic
voyage By 20 he had robbed the fabled
Silver Train And by 26 he had raided
half of the strongholds of the Spanish
Main Sir Francis Drake was Englands
greatest mariner and probably the best
treasure hunter the world has ever known
And then right at the height of his fame
and power -- he dies Suddenly He’s
quickly buried at sea in a hidden
location off the coast of Panama Why
Why not the noble funeral back in England
he earned And what about his fortune
only a fraction of which has ever been
accounted for Finding his coffin is the
key to one of the great historical
mysteries And I know where it is

Nate unfurls the map laying it out between them

ELENA
Is it a map There are no words on it --

NATE
Exactly No windrose showing which way is
north No location names No legend and
no key Drake encrypted his maps so they
were useless to anyone but himself

ELENA
So then how do you read it

Nate pulls the rawhide cord from around his neck and
shows Elena the silver ring

NATE
The Drake Ring This is what started me
down this road Drake once called it the
“key” to the adventure of his life

Nate shows Elena the inside of the ring Markings Words

ELENA
Sic parvis magna

NATE
Greatness comes from small beginnings
The Drake family motto But that’s not
the most interesting marking

Elena notices one other mark The symbol of an EYE

Nate rolls the ring along the map until it finds -- THE
SAME SYMBOL The EYE

He stands the ring up so the eye inside the ring lines up
exactly over the one on the map

ELENA
I don’t understand --

Nate puts his finger to his lips

NATE
Just watch Words do not do this justice

Nate takes the candle on the table and moves it to the
edge of the map where sure enough a tiny CANDLE SYMBOL
is

Nate places the candle atop its symbol --

AND AS THE CANDLE LIGHT SHINES THROUGH THE HOOP OF THE
RING THE MAP CHANGES

The grooves forming the words inside the ring reflect
lines of light criss-crossing along the map Two of
these lines of light cross a series of curved lines --
AND MAKING THEM NOW READABLE AS WORDS Suddenly one
coastline reads PLAYA ARANJA and an island in the middle
of the map reads ISLA POPA

And the final two lines of light -- they cross each other
in the middle of the sea FORMING AN xX

Elena shivers with excitement She puts her hand on
Nate’s accidentally They look in each other’s eyes The
moment is electric And then she pulls away

ELENA
So what now How exactly does treasure
hunting work Is it legal to pull up
three hundred year old coffins Shouldnt
you be telling some museum or maybe the
English government

NATE
Those thieves I do my best to steer
clear of them

ELENA
And the big guys with the guns They
thieves too What makes you the good guy
in all this Why should I trust you

Nate’s losing her and he knows it He takes Elena’s note
pad and starts writing on it

NATE
There are no good guys or bad guys There
are only lines and the men who cross
them
He slides the notepad over to her

ELENA
What is this

NATE
A contract Granting you total and
exclusive access to the greatest treasure
hunt in modern times
Then Elena notices the signature

ELENA
Nathan Drake

Nate flashes that million dollar smile and winks
NATE
Why do you think he’s been an obsession

of mine Come on Let’s go dig up grampa

blasts

Elena navigates the narrow hallway The music’s louder
ELENA
Nate Nate
INT NATE’S CABIN - DAY

Elena enters the seemingly empty cabin

She hears really energetic if off-key singing to
Gasolina Elena turns to see Nate through the transparent
door of the shower lathering his hair and belting out
the Spanish rap At least his Spanish is perfect

She quickly turns away She backs slowly out the door --

And freezes Temptation sets in She takes a second look
at his tanned body An all over tan tells us more about
Nathan Drake

Then she notices his DUFFEL BAG the only personal
possession in the room She can’t resist She opens it

She pulls out ammo boxes -- a counterfeit plate -- a
bundle of dress clothes (in fact the ones he wore the
other night) -- a switchblade -- four different passports
-- a grenade -- a lock pick set -- and a stuffed folder
labeled DRAKE

Elena flips through the folder Handwritten notes aged
Manuscripts genealogical trees -- but then something
catches Elena’s eye in the duffel

She pulls out a shoebox A shoebox packed with
PHOTOS

A young Nate with a distinguished woman who must be his
MOM A teenage Nate with an older man (who we will learn
is SULLY) holding up a barnacle-encrusted CROSS

NATE (0S)
I was wondering how far you wanted to
take the concept of “total access”

Elena spins around spotting a wet Nate holding a towel
around his waist He reaches back into the shower
shutting it off

ELENA
I was just uh -- snooping Sorry
Professional hazard

Nate grabs his jeans and drops the towel Embarrassed
Elena spins around to avoid looking

ELENA (CONT’D)
In my defense I’m out here in the
middle of the sea alone with a guy I
hardly know

Nate realizes she has a point Elena hands him the
photos
NATE
Youre right Ask whatever you want

ELENA
The older woman Your mother
(Nate grunts a yeah)
She’s very beautiful And the man He’s
your dad

Nate LAUGHS a bellowing laugh

NATE
Sully is a lot of things but a father

ELENA
So you don’t have a picture of your dad

NATE
Had one Lost it

Elena decides not to press the issue

ELENA
Okay Where are you from Where’s home

NATE
You just rifled through it

ELENA
Look you obviously don’t want to answer
anything --

NATE

No There’s just nothing to say You
know people who are their jobs That’s
me I run a historical Lost and Found
King so-and-so lost some jewel-encrusted
crap That means today I’m researching
in a library archive tomorrow I’m in
Borneo digging it up

ELENA
And this jewel-encrusted crap You put it
in a museum

NATE
I find smaller collections pay better
Private ones

ELENA
So it’s all about the money

NATE
For every ten things I search for I’m
lucky if I find one So yeah I make damn
sure that one pays off

ELENA
Then today might be payday That
Magnetometer thing It’s pinging

A smile crosses Nate’s lips

EXT DIVE TRAWLER —- DAY

Off the stern a CRANE dangles cables --

EXT UNDERWATER —- DAY

We follow the cables down to the sea floor through a
sargasso sea of kelp beds until we find --

Nate and Elena wearing wetsuits and scuba equipment
Nate is pulling the crane’s cables toward --

THE IRON CASKET OF SIR FRANCIS DRAKE
Nate carefully connects the cable hooks with the stays

creating a cradle for bringing the casket up

EXT DIVE TRAWLER —- DAY

The crane motor chugs away as it lowers its catch to the

(narrating)
What you are seeing is the end of one of
the greatest mysteries in the history of
exploration This is the coffin of Sir
Francis Drake pirate explorer and
adventurer lost for centuries Now found
by his descendant Nathan Drake

Drake jams the crowbar in a seam and forces the top of
the casket off Dusty air escapes out of the airtight
chamber Nate coughs as he breathes in a lungful

He steps toward the casket So does Elena Breathless
anticipation Elena comes around behind him squinting as
she peers into the casket expecting rotten remains

ELENA (CONT’D)
Oh my god That’s -- that’s -- empty

CASKET

Sure enough there’s no body inside But there is
something inside wrapped in oilskin

NATE
I knew it I KNEW it You sly old
bastard You tricked everyone but you
didn’t trick me

He unwraps it carefully

ELENA
What are you so happy about There’s no
body here

NATE

Check your contract The deal was finding
the coffin Never promised you a body

Elena’s initial shock over Nathan’s blase attitude

dissipates with the realization -- she’s been screwed
ELENA
You knew he wasn’t in there didn’t you
You were after -- what is that anyway

Beneath the oilskin Nate finds a small leather-bound
journal a COAT OF ARMS on its cover His eyes brighten

NATE
The answer To what happened to Sir
Francis and the fifteen ships under his
command
Elena looks off into the distance brow furrowed

ELENA
Boats

NATE
No ships There’s a difference

Elena stares over Nate’s shoulder

ELENA
No Boats

NATE
Ships are mostly big Boats are mostly
small A ship can hold a boat but a boat
can never hold a ship

Elena grabs Nate and turns him to see what she sees Sure
enough five SPEEDBOATS close in on the dive trawler

ELENA
Like I said Boats Who are they

NATE
Damn Pirates

ELENA

Very funny Let me know when the ninjas
show up

Nate ignores her and goes for one of his equipment boxes
He flips it open revealing two chrome plated 45s He
stuffs extra magazines in his pockets

ELENA (CONTD)
Whoah Wait You’re serious

AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE erupts from the speedboats
simultaneously Elena SCREAMS as Nate pushes her head
down behind the crane just as bullets ring off it

ELENA (CONTD)
They’re shooting at us

NATE
Relax In my business we call that
negotiating Just keep your head down I
can talk our way out of this

And then the gunfire stops The speedboats form a circle
around the trawler

EDDY (0S)
Tai kamu Nate That you buddy

Nate’s face drops

NATE
Oh no

Nate pops his head up and gets a good look at his
opponents Five speedboats each manned by three
INDONESIAN PIRATES And their leader is EDDY RAJA Eddy’s
diminutive and mouthy with crazy eyes and a crazier mind
NATE (CONTD)
Eddy Raja How the hell are you

EDDY
Me I’m good Right now Top of the
world

NATE

Youre not still upset about that little
thing back in Jakarta

EDDY
What thing Sleeping with my sister

NATE
No The other thing
(to Elena)
It’s not what it sounds like

Elena just shoots him a look and turns her camera on

EDDY
Cheating me in that poker game

NATE
No The other thing

EDDY
Oh you must mean stealing the Jade
Empress and screwing me out of my cut

NATE
That would be it You still mad about
that We both know I just beat you to the
punch --

EDDY
You did break rule number one

ELENA
(whispering)
What’s rule number one

EDDY AND NATE
(simultaneous )
Don’t mess with Eddy Raja

NATE
What can I do to make it up to you
buddy

EDDY

Maybe you just stick your head out a
little bit more

him

NATE
Anything else

EDDY
Nothing comes to mind

Suddenly Nate pops up and FIRES his pistols at the
pirate boat sneaking up behind him He doesn’t have the
stance of a marksman In fact his technique is beyond
sloppy But the results --

Six bullets Three pirates go down Double tap Center
mass Eddy and the other pirates on his boat open fire
with AK-47s peppering the crane gantry with lead

EDDY (CONTD)
Move it Move it Circles Don’t give him
an easy shot

The speedboats power up They circle the trawler at about
a twenty foot distance Too far for Nate to get to them
Too close for them to miss

Bullets ring and ricochet off the crane as Nate and Elena
huddle in their tiny sliver of protection

Near the wheelhouse the bullets sever an electrical line
and it dances and sparks

ELENA
What did you get me into

NATE
You wanted a real story Good guys Bad
guys Adventure

ELENA
So where are the good guys

NATE
Funny

Then Nate notices the crane control panel not far off

NATE (CONT’D)
See the red lever on the control panel
over there When I yell “now” push it to
the right Can you do that

Elena nods scared Nate sticks his pistols out of the
crane gantry and fires off shots in all directions And
then he runs for the stern of the boat

NATE (CONT’D)
Now

Elena heads to the control panel and the ground around
her gets peppered with GUNFIRE She dives back to cover
hyperventilating leaving Nate exposed waiting for her

NATE (0S) (CONT’D)
Now

Elena steels herself then runs from cover reaching the
control panel She pushes the red lever The crane
springs to life rotating quickly The loose cables on the
end of the crane swing wide

Nate grabs one of the cables as it passes and it
catapults him out over the sea He times it perfectly
letting go and landing right on --

PIRATE SPEEDBOAT

His momentum threatens to carry him right off the back
until he clotheslines the two pirates at the stern
knocking them into the water

Behind him the pirate driving the boat spins AK at the
ready -- BLAM He falls to his knees surprised Nate
fired his gun around his back without even looking

He drops his pistol in favor of the AK-47 He strafes the
pirate boat behind him Like dominos they all go down

But GUNFIRE erupts from up ahead as well He spins to see
the pirates on the boat in front of him And they have
him dead to rights when --

SLAM The swinging cables of the crane lash out and knock
them into each other Nate looks over at Elena still
working the controls

NATE (CONTD)
Not bad Not half bad

On the trawler the sparking wire reaches a gas canister
It blows up and a fire quickly engulfs the wheelhouse

Eddy calls to the other two circling boats
EDDY

I really hate that guy The boat He’s on
our boat

Everyone shifts aim to the speedboat Nate is on Nate
dives for the wheel slamming down the throttle The boat
careens forward throwing a powerful wake

Eddy pushes his driver aside powering up his throttle as
well And the chase is on

Suddenly Eddy ducks just in time to narrowly miss the
swinging cables from the crane

EDDY (CONTD)
Where does he find these women

He ducks again as Elena swings the cables back at him
One of his PIRATES takes a cable to the face and is
knocked into the sea

Eddy FIRES at Elena causing her to duck PING PING The
gunfire puts holes in the steel drum next to her FUEL is
written on its side

ELENA
Nate Nate

Nate ducks to avoid incoming gunfire He pulls hard on
the wheel slaloming to dodge the heaviest fire

NATE
I’m kinda busy

But then Nate sees the fire spreading

NATE (CONTD)
Fantastic

Gunfire stops his conversation dead He looks ahead and
spots two of the other boats heading dead on for him

Nate swerves around the first boat punching the
throttle and turning back toward the second boat His
speedboat LEAPS THE WAKE of the first boat catching air
and careening over the second boat KNOCKING ALL THE
PIRATES INTO THE SEA

The gas advances toward the wheelhouse fire Elena grabs
wetsuits and tries to form a dam For a moment it works

Until another barrage of gunfire punctures more drums
The rivulet becomes a river The gas races for the fire

ELENA
Nate

Nate glances over and sees the disaster brewing He spins
the wheel turning his boat to face the trawler

NATE
I’m coming

Another pirate speedboat closes Nate fires the AK
CLICK Empty The pirates smile They got him now

He reaches behind his back drawing one of his pistols
Cool as a cucumber he plugs the driver The boat spins
out of control and Nate shoots the disoriented gunmen

Nate guns the engine racing right for the trawler

The gas reaches the flames Elena’s trapped surrounded
by oil drums She spins to see Nate suddenly very close

Nate lets out a primal YELL tensing his body The
speedboat slams into the side of the trawler just as Nate
leaps into the air

His momentum carries him clear over the deck He reaches
out with his arm grabbing Elena by her shirt --

And pulling her with him overboard

Just as the flames reach the other drums The trawler
explodes raining debris in every direction

EXT OPEN SEA -— CONTINUOUS

Debris rains down on the sea No sign of Nate or Elena --
ELENA’S VIDEOCAMERA breaks the surface first A moment
later Nate and Elena surface Elena coughs out a healthy
dose of seawater She spins around to see the trawler a

burned out hulk already

ELENA
I suppose a thank you might be in order

NATE
That was nice work with that crane

ELENA
Thanks I just pretended it was an
immunity challenge

Nate gives her a questioning look

ELENA (CONT’D)
That’s how I got my start on camera
Survivor Season Four runner up

NATE
What’s Survivor

Around the wreck comes Eddy’s speedboat Eddy backs the
boat toward Nate and Elena the engine’s propellers
cutting through the water like scythes

EDDY
Me do’i I’m the survivor here All
around the world people will cheer the
day Eddy Raja cut Nathan Drake to shreds

Nate and Elena can only watch the blades grow closer But
then Eddy stops putting the boat into neutral

EDDY (CONTD)
But my joy will have to wait bego I got
biz to talk See you got something I’m
getting paid to take You just better
hope it didn’t go down with the ship

NATE
What are you looking for

EDDY
Same thing Navarro wanted

NATE
You’re working with Navarro now

EDDY
What you’re into brah It’s attracted
bigger fish So do you give me what I
want or do I turn the girl into sashimi

Nate looks at Elena Elena looks at Nate She can’t
believe it’s taking him a moment to decide

ELENA
You gotta be kidding me

NATE
There is option three

EDDY
No there ain’t

NATE
Sure there is Option three is you get
your head taken off by a seaplane

Eddy cracks up again laughing his head off --

Until he catches something out of the corner of his eye
He spins to see A SEAPLANE gliding in for a landing --
coming right for him Eddy SCREAMS

BOOM The seaplane smashes down right on top of Eddy’s
boat breaking it apart Only then do its engines come on
as it turns around and comes for Nate and Elena

ELENA
What the hell was that

NATE
That That was Sully To a T

The seaplane pulls up next to them and a moment later the
hatch on the side opens revealing VICTOR “SULLY”
SULLIVAN (late 50s) chomping on a cigar

SULLY
I can’t leave you alone for a minute Who
was the little guy with the big gun

NATE
Eddy

SULLY
Raja Really Shoulda told me I’d a made
a point to splatter him on my windshield
Oh but where are my manners
He extends a hand to Elena helping her onto the plane
SULLY (CONTD)

Victor Sullivan at your service But my
friends and lovers call me Sully

INT SEAPLANE - DAY
Elena smiles and slowly pulls her hand back from his

ELENA
Somebody’s been ODing on their Viagra

Elena takes off her wet-suit She doesn’t seem to notice
that her white t-shirt underneath is soaking wet

Nate and Sully can’t help but stare Finally she notices
pulling her shirt away from her body pissed

ELENA (CONT’D)
Gentlemen wouldn’t look
SULLY

Honey a dead man would look

ELENA

Keep talking like that and we’ll test

that theory
Nate just smiles as he heads with
COCKPIT

Sully keeps his voice low Behind

All three stare down into camera in various states of
excitement

ELENA
Well What are you waiting for

NATE
Give me a sec okay This is a huge
moment

SULLY
Give it to me Ill do it

(to Elena)

He always gets like a kid on Christmas
morning --

NATE

I got it I just -- wanted to give this
moment a little bit of reverence is all

Nate opens the journal They squint down at it having
trouble

ELENA
Well we know one thing about Drake He
had horrible penmanship

NATE
“January 1597 The Queen had grown
impatient as that snake Alvarado
continued to slip through my grasp to
find retreat on Isla Oculta Until he
made one mistake He sent a copy of his
map to Spain And on the 24th of
December we rammed a fast cutter and
found the copy onboard Our goal is
verified What we race for is nothing
less than the greatest treasure of the
New World And nothing more than the
making -- or undoing -- of an empire”

Nate turns the page He and Sully rear back at once As
though they’d seen a ghost

SULLY
Well slap me on my ass and call me Rosy

REVERSE ANGLE - THE MAP

A map of rivers jungles and coastline and at its
center a small gold mark labeled OMAGUA

SULLY (CONTD)
Hot-damn I knew you were onto something
but Omagua

NATE
You knew I was onto something You said
playing solitaire was more productive
than hunting down Sir Francis

SULLY
That was for your own good -- and how the
hell was I supposed to know it would lead
to Omagua

ELENA
What exactly is Omagua

Nate and Sully smile at each other

SULLY
It’s the Lost-Goddamn-City of Gold

ELENA
Wait are you talking about El Dorado

NATE
El Dorado Cibola Manoa Omagua --
they’re all just different names for the
same myth

SULLY
The conquistadors gold hungry bastards
that they were were like kids in a candy
store when they hit the Americas See
all these tribes revered gold They
prayed over it chanted to it sacrificed
for it Hell tribal chiefs painted
themselves with it So the Spanish
started taking their gold --

NATE
-- and butchering the tribes But the
legendary Omagua Nobody ever found it

ELENA
A city of gold You actually believe in
something that ridiculous

NATE
I don’t need to Sir Francis did

Sully give Nate a wry smile

NATE (CONTD)
Whatever Omagua is if Sir Francis called
it the treasure of a lifetime it’s gotta
be the biggest cache of gold in history

Silence Awe

ELENA
I need to sit down

SULLY
I need a drink

NATE
We need the Vienna Boys Choir singing the
Hallelujah Chorus -- but we’1l have to do
with whatever the dockmaster’s selling

Nate heads out of the cabin until Sully grabs his arm

SULLY
I wouldn’t We’re in Colombia

Nate backs away from the dock

ELENA
So What does that mean

NATE
Nothing Nothing just a misunderstanding
with a Colombian Colonel

ELENA
Have you met anyone who hasn’t wanted to
kill you

NATE
Let’s just say I don’t leave people
indifferent

surprised by what he’s drinking

She does She deserves our absence from

SULLY
So was that broad in Jakarta And that
sweet little thing in Lagos And I’m not
even going to mention Chloe

doesn’t notice Nate throwing off the bow line attaching

journal by lantern light

SULLY (0S)
You know it’s not in there don’t you

Sully comes walking in from the helm

NATE
What

SULLY
What you’re looking for It can’t be

NATE
I’m reading Drake’s intel on Omagua I
havent thought about -- that other thing
-- in years

SULLY
(not convinced)
Uh-huh

NATE
Listen to this “I stand convinced that
there is more to Omagua than its gold A
darker secret A secret that may tell us
how an empire of two million could be
wiped from the map in the blink of an
eye” Is he talking about the Incas

SULLY
I don’t care if he’s talking about the
rapture We got a problem

Sully turns the journal to the map labeled Omagua

SULLY (CONTD)
I’ve triple checked every map on this
half of the globe There is no spot on
this green earth that matches that map

NATE
Bring me the Scotch

SULLY
I sympathize but maybe we should try and
figure it out before we get plastered --

Nate ignores Sully and fetches the bottle himself He
bends the journal back on itself so only the map page
rests on the table

And then he pours the Scotch out over the map THE RIVERS
DISAPPEAR AND OTHER LINES AND WORDS MATERIALIZE LIKE
MAGIC CREATING A WHOLE NEW MAP

SULLY (CONTD)
I don’t believe it

NATE
He called the technique a “rum map” but I
figured any alcohol will do

were going to Peru

CUT TO

EXT BATTING CAGE - NIGHT

ECU side angle of a red square on a white background
BLAM A fastball slams into the center of it its force
knocking the target back a foot before the chain link
fence it is attached to sways back

WE PULL BACK to reveal Eddy Raja and one of his pirates
up against the same fence their mouths gagged Two
MERCENARIES pin their arms on the other side of the
fence They squint staring into the harsh spotlights
unable to see where the pitches are coming from

ROMAN (0S)

In this part of the world there are only
a few things of great value Drugs of
course Oil if you can find any
Antiquities And human talent

FOOMP Another fastball pounds the target between them

ROMAN (0S) (CONTD)

A boy from a village nearby was graced
with just such a talent He could throw a
baseball at ninety five miles an hour A
ninety five mile an hour fastball travels
from the mound to the catcher’s glove in
less than four tenths of a second It can
cause as much soft tissue trauma as a 38
caliber bullet

FOOMP The fastball catches Eddy dead in the chest Eddy
SCREAMS into his gag his eyes wide in shock and pain

FOOMP Another fastball catches the other pirate in the
solar plexus He SCREAMS as well gasping for air

ROMAN (0S) (CONT’D)
He once earned a multi-million dollar
contract I negotiated on his behalf And
yet his value to me is fading He is
what we in the banking world call a
depreciating asset The ravages of time
against the brilliance of talent Time
will always win in the end

FOOMP This time the baseball smashes into the fence just
inches from Eddy’s head He stares terrified into the
bright spotlights thinking he’s about to die

The spotlights go out revealing a MOUNTAINTOP LUXURY
VILLA complete with infinity pool tennis courts etc

As Eddy’s eyes adjust GABRIEL ROMAN steps out of the
darkness In a very expensive Italian suit he’s a man of
bearing and sophistication with the eyes of a shark
Next to him stands Atog Navarro looking uncomfortable
himself Behind him stands a row of HEAVILY ARMED
MULTINATIONAL MERCENARIES

And atop the pitcher’s mound a COLOMBIAN PHENOM PITCHER
His eyes steely and focused but he is sweating He holds
another ball in his hand twirling it ready to throw

ROMAN (CONTD)

When an asset depreciates enough it can
sometimes cost more than it is worth It
is then called a toxic asset An asset in
need of liquidation What kind of asset
are you Eddy

He nods to his mercs and they remove Eddy’s gag but they
keep his arms trapped

EDDY
I’m good Strong Give me another chance
Mr Roman and Ill prove it to you

ROMAN
Haven’t we seen enough proof already
Fifteen of you went after the Drake
diary and one man beat you

EDDY
Drake ain’t no average man and the girl
was there too Mr Roman we done a lot
of business together How many ships I
steal for you I been with you longer
than Navarro

Roman nods to the pitcher He hurls another fastball that
catches Eddy in the chest SNAP We can hear ribs break
Eddy coughs blood spilling from his mouth

ROMAN
Loyalty is only valuable when paired with
competence Atog may be a recent hire
but his archaeological knowledge is very
much in need

Roman reaches down into a lone crate in front of Navarro
From it he pulls out a VASE

ROMAN (CONT’D)
Mr Navarro what can you tell me about
this item

NAVARRO
It’s a Sumerian bathing vessel

ROMAN
Very good Now what is it worth I’1l
even give you a hint in 2002 it was
priceless

Navarro doesn’t immediately answer Roman spins around a
bat in his hand With a vicious swing he shatters the
vase into a thousand pieces

ROMAN (CONTD)
It’s worthless Because in 2003 looters
raided the Iraqi National Museum
removing a hundred thousand antiquities
And over the last seven years these
items have been flooding the market
turning priceless collections into curio
shops My priceless collections

Roman swings the bat angrily through the air Coming
within inches of Navarro’s head

ROMAN (CONT’D)
I am a banker gentlemen A banker for
dangerous people who cannot use any
normal bank These items are my capital
And my capital is draining But Omagua
can change that

Roman nods to the pitcher

ROMAN (CONTD)
Failure in this task will incur the
heaviest of penalties

The pitcher hesitates for just a moment then grits his
teeth and hurls a fastball at the batter’s box The
pitch goes wide and slams into the temple of one of
Roman’s Mercs The Merc drops like a stone Eyes open
Dead

Roman pulls out a pistol AND SHOOTS THE PITCHER DEAD He
shoots Navarro a dark glance showing his displeasure

ROMAN (CONTD)
He’s gotten a little wild

We see what they’re gaping at -- the huge and
cosmopolitan city of Lima Peru

Somehow I thought it would be shinier

NATE
It might still be there buried under the

around the back finding a rear fire door

Nate rummages through his backpack while Sully looks up
at the tiny TRANSOM window over the door cracked a hair

What’s the plan Lose a hundred and fifty
pounds and slip in the window

Sully’s confused for a moment as Nate pulls out a Zippo
lighter and a heavy-duty tape measure Then he gets it

It has to be correspondence from 1597 or
it’s useless Maybe if you could read a
lick of Spanish you’d give me a hand

Maybe I can help

Nate and Sully turn to see a tall redheaded mature woman
in a spotless white business suit Meet FRANCESCA TORRES
or more commonly FRANK She’s flanked by two HUGE GUYS

The last thing Nate sees is a massive FIST

CUT TO

INT MUSEUM - STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

NATE’S POV Nate’s vision clears to find his head
immobilized by a wooden board Frank stares down at Nate
upside down

FRANK
I can’t believe you came back concha

NATE
I told you I would What’s the problem

SULLY (0S)
Turns out Frank’s a little upset

Nate turns and sees Sully on his knees guns to his head

NATE
No kidding Why Frank Why

FRANK
I do so love a man with a sense of humor
It’s a pity you had to cheat me That
Huari pottery you sold the museum was
nothing but a forgery

NATE
So I told you the first time I walked in
here half your collection are fakes

FRANK
But then you went and sold the real vase
to a private collector and it seems you
neglected to forward me my cut pendejo

Frank backs away and Nate can see what his head is
trapped under It is an antique GUILLOTINE

FRANK (CONTD)
How about I take my cut now

She fingers the rope that releases the guillotine blade

NATE
You wouldn’t Frank --

FRANK
Oh you may be a pretty boy Nate but I
absolutely would In fact the only thing
stopping me is curiosity Why would you
willingly come back here It’s gotta be
something big

NATE
It’s just a little research project

Frank tugs on the rope Nate sees the latch above move

NATE (CONT’D)
Big Big research project It’s my -- our
-- way to pay you back Your cut on the
old job would’ve been -- ten thousand

One of the huge guys beside Sully chimes in

HUGE GUY
Seventy eight thousand five hundred and
six dollars Counting interest

NATE
You might have a problem with your math

FRANK
Better a math problem than a physics
problem Gravity is not your friend

She tugs on the rope again Again the latch moves ever
closer to releasing the blade

FRANK (CONTD)
Youre lying on the Bloody Maria In her
day she killed more men than cancer

Another tug The blade just barely catches the latch

NATE
Fine Seventy eight grand No problem

FRANK
What is it that is worth so much

NATE
Kill me and you’1l never find out

Frank smiles and calls the bluff She yanks hard on the
rope THE GUILLOTINE BLADE FALLS RIGHT FOR NATE’S NECK

NATE (CONT’D)
Omagua

SCHING The blade passes harmlessly through Nate’s
neck leaving him untouched

Frank and her men LAUGH uproariously Nate is shaking as
Frank unlocks the wooden stock around his neck He bolts
upright checking his neck to be sure it is in one piece

FRANK
You like We’ve got a History of Magic
exhibition next week you should come by

Omagua It’s really true I’m sorry I
didn’t believe you

like him I’d cultivate a healthy
distrust myself

Nate and Sully turn to see Elena enter the room

No
She smiles -- and then punches Nate square in the face
ELENA
We had a deal you son of a bitch You
used me
NATE

I borrowed you

ELENA
I trusted you

NATE
Trusted me You don’t even know me

FRANK

Tsk-tsk The problem darling is not
that we don’t know you It’s that we do
and yet we look in those blue eyes and
want to believe in you anyway

(to Elena)
He’s quite addictive isn’t he I
would’ve tracked him down too if I
could

SULLY
How the hell did you find us anyway

Elena pulls her new cellphone from her pocket She
presses dial A ringtone of Lady Gaga’s Poker Face
echoes Nate looks around then realizes the sound is
coming from his jacket He pulls out ELENA’S IPHONE

NATE
You gotta be kidding me

ELENA
Finding two-timing scumbags There’s an
app for that

FRANK
Now that our happy reunion has occurred
let us begin returning my hundred and
fifty six thousand dollars

NATE
Your what
SULLY
(sullen)

Seventy eight for the last deal Seventy
eight for this one

NATE
Right That math’s a killer

INT MUSEUM - HISTORICAL ARCHIVES - NIGHT

Frank unlocks a caged room of ancient documents and leads
Nate Sully and Elena inside

FRANK
Everything I’ve collected about Omagua is
in this room But there’s not a lot to
see The Incas were too scared of Omagua
to speak about his temple

NATE
Him I thought Omagua was a place

FRANK
Oh no Omagua was their God of Death

Frank opens an ancient illuminated text revealing a
drawing of Omagua a terrifying looking demongod with
blood red eyes and tusk-like fangs

FRANK (CONTD)
They feared him above all other gods
which is why they filled his temple with
gold offerings They protected its
location out of absolute terror No one
dared to even lay eyes on Omagua’s gold
Do you know the story of Atahualpa

ELENA
The last king of the Incas

Everyone looks at Elena surprised

ELENA (CONT’D)
Hello Reporter Remember

Frank turns the page to a drawing of a native king
imprisoned

FRANK
The story is called the Ransom Room The
conquistador Pizarro captured Atahualpa
but he gave the king one chance to live
If he could fill his jail cell with gold
Pizarro would release him It was a
trick Pizarro knew he had raided nearly
all the Incan treasures Atahualpa could
never amass enough gold

NATE
Unless he knew where Omagua was --

FRANK
The monk who drew these claimed Atahualpa
ordered his brother to fetch a forbidden
stash of gold The gold of Omagua gold
now cursed by the God of Death himself

She turns the page At the top a Spanish conquistador
strangles Atahualpa Beneath scenes of mayhem and death
The death of the Incas

FRANK (CONTD)
No one knows what happened after that We
know the gold Atahualpa promised never
reached his cell We know that a nation
of millions suddenly died and disappeared
without a trace

Frank turns another page Wild eyed bloody Incas frenzy
and kill each other

SULLY
Yeah yeah “And some nights you can
still hear the cries of Atahualpa --”

FRANK
That’s what I like about you Sully Your
greed makes you impervious to fear

And with that Frank leaves them to it They spread out
gathering papers and piling them on the table in the
center of the room

LATER
ECU WE MOVE OVER a landscape of ancient books and
papers Maps Ledgers Deeds Letters Ancient cursive

writing Spanish language All laid out over the floor

We move up over Sully dead asleep drooling on a stack
of papers We find Elena similarly asleep in a corner

And we end on Nate red-eyed and frustrated flipping
through assorted letters His eyes fall upon Elena her
head tilted uncomfortably against her shoulder

Nate takes off his jacket and places it between her head
and shoulder careful not to wake her up Nate stares at
her face peaceful in slumber

Then Nate turns back to the letters Elena’s eyes open
watching him Then Nate catches something He bolts
upright He stares closely at the paper in his hands

ELENA
Something

NATE
It’s a letter from the governor to Juan
Guerrero a wealthy landowner basically
responding to a domestic complaint
Guerrero was protesting a sea captain and
his men digging all hours of the day and
night

ELENA
That’s it That’s all

NATE

The governor apologizes for the admiral’s
behavior Admiral Not captain In 1597
there were maybe twenty admirals in the
Spanish fleet But in Peru

ELENA
That’s got to be the one Drake was
chasing Alvarado Where was he digging

NATE
It doesn’t say All it says is the
governor promises him the land in
question will -- “never again be
disturbed It will become the quietest
district in the city” A church maybe

ELENA
I lived next to a church growing up
Those bells are anything but quiet No
It would have to be someplace people
rarely go No roads buildings people
Someplace as quiet --

Nate and Elena get it at the same time

NATE AND ELENA
-- as the grave

They both grin from ear to ear Sully wakes to see them
staring at each other excitedly He pulls his hat down
over his eyes and tries to go back to sleep

EXT MATIAS MAESTRO GENERAL CEMETERY - DUSK

Soaring overhead we see the sprawling cemetery has
countless mausoleums of every shape and size

We move down on a couple taking a stroll through the
gorgeous gothic cemetery It turns out to be Elena and
Sully Two POLICE OFFICERS approach Sully grabs her hand
and nuzzles her neck Elena tries to pull away but
Sully’s got too good a grip

ELENA
Let go of me if you value your hand

SULLY
Sorry sweetheart but we’ve got to sell
the grieving couple angle We don’t want
to draw attention

ELENA
You and me Couple Who would buy that

SULLY
(sarcastic)
Yeah Older man younger woman in South
America We’re really gonna stick out
like a sore thumb

ELENA
Youre disgusting You know every now
and then I see a glimmer of humanity out
of Nate -- and then he starts acting like
you again

SULLY
Youre damn right That’s why he’s still
alive You think you’re the first girl
who saw Nate as her personal fixer upper

ELENA
Wait a minute All I care about is my
story That’s it

SULLY
Horseshit You listen for a change Nate
is like a son to me So you stop messing
with his head and you stop it now or
youre gonna kill him
We were in
civil war
hell out of
port inas
eight Hindu

Sully looks around makes sure Nate isn’t near

SULLY (CONTD)
the middle of a Sri Lankan
the Tamil Tigers bombing the
Jafna We’re racing to the
tolen tuk tuk carrying these
idols sporting more bling

than Liberace when we clip a dog A damn
mangy street dog already half dead The
mortars are dropping everywhere
Government troops are closing off
streets I tell Nate we gotta go But the
son of a bitch won’t Not until he gets
the damn dog to a hospital

ELENA
And that’s a bad thing

SULLY
They found the idols they arrested him
and then they shot the dog And he spent
eight months in a Sri Lankan prison
before I managed to bribe him out Do you
have any idea what it’s like in a Sri
Lankan prison

ELENA
But he did the right thing --

SULLY
This is why you gotta shut up In your
world you got mommy and daddy You got
money education you got a safety net
You can do the right thing and make
yourself feel as good as you want But
for guys like Nate and me Most times the
right thing gets you killed

The police officers disappear far down the walk

SULLY (CONTD)
(into radio mike)
Ok The local Guarda are clear
this party started

Let’s get
Sully pulls out a remote control and thumbs the switch A
FIREWORKS SHOW GOES OFF on the far side of the cemetery
NATE

Lays wreath of flowers against the wall of a black marble
TOMB and ducks around the corner

BOOM The wreath explodes knocking a stone slab aside
The noise was well covered by the fireworks

Nate looks around and then slips in A moment later Sully
and Elena stroll by and slip in as well

INT CRYPT - NIGHT

The walls are lined with coffins in this family crypt
sealed into the thick marble walls In the center of the
room on a raised dais is the stone coffin of the
patriarch of the family

ELENA
Before we go -- violating remains -- are
we sure this is the place

Nate points at the arch of the entrance Elena can
clearly read the word “GUERRERO” accompanied by the
family crest

NATE
Remember the landowner who wrote the
complaint The governor promised him the
best family tomb in the place

SULLY
I got something here There’s some kind
of bar mechanism under the stones

Sully kneels down examining the loose cobblestone floor
Nate checks the other side

NATE
It’s here too

ELENA
What does it mean

NATE
The floor was built to move somehow We
just have to find the release

All eyes turn to the coffin in the center Nate moves
over to the heavy lid

ELENA
Wait -- is it safe I mean couldn’t the
Spaniards have built a trap or something
to keep people out

Sully and Nate exchange a glance and LAUGH

SULLY
Adorable

NATE
That’s mostly a movie thing Elena

Nate crouches down and pushes the stone lid off the
coffin The lid is attached to a chain mechanism that
spins --

AND SUDDENLY THE ENTIRE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER COLLAPSES
The coffin the stone floor and Nate Sully and Elena
fall as though they’ve cracked through thin ice tumbling
into the darkness

Nate lashes out a hand and grabs Elena’s wrist Sully
grabs a handhold on the side of what has now become a pit
-- but he misses grabbing Nate’s outstretched hand

Nate grabs a handhold but with Elena in his other hand
he doesn’t have the strength to hold They tumble again
Again he tries a hold This time the rock crumbles in his
grasp

They fall again One last time he digs his hand into a
handhold and this time -- it holds Just then Elena
SCREAMS

Nate turns to look at her and discovers that Elena
dangles less than three feet above A FOREST OF RAZOR
SHARP WOODEN SPIKES If they fell just one second more
they’d be dead

ELENA
A movie thing A movie thing

NATE
I did say “mostly”

Nate swings her over to the edge of the pit where no
spikes stand and drops her She lands at the foot of the
pit At the mouth of a passageway she finds a bin filled
with torches Nate joins her

Up above Sully still struggles

SULLY
What do I gotta do to get some help
around here Take a bullet
(calling down)
Don’t worry about me I’m just peachy

Sully carefully climbs down the pit wall

NATE
Grumpiest expedition in history

INT THE CHAMBER OF OMAGUA - NIGHT

Carrying torches the three look in awe at the sight
before them They are in a massive arched subterranean
temple Each wall is carved with more of the bas relief
sculptures of demons Each carving seems to be more
disturbing than the last

SULLY
What do they say

NATE
You got me

SULLY
What do you mean “you got me”

NATE
Did I spend years studying Meso-American
archaeology No I know the money
empires Incan Mayan Aztec and this
writing is older than all them Beyond
that I would’ve needed to go to college

ELENA
Well why didn’t you

NATE
Because some old fart told me it was a
waste of time

SULLY
That’s always been your problem you
listen to me too much

ELENA
If you two ladies are done I think I
found something over here

Elena shines her light on what she found STONE DOORS
THIRTY FEET HIGH The doors are covered in ornate
carvings The carvings depicts a MASSIVE GOLDEN GOD
propped up atop a dais worshipers laying at its feet

NATE
Look at that dais Omagua’s a statue

SULLY
One lousy statue We went through all of
this for --

NATE
Sully look at the scale

Sure enough the size of the golden god compared to the
worshipers is truly awesome

SULLY
That thing’s gotta be --

NATE
Eighty tons Minimum

Sully points out a FIGURE clothed in finery standing
before the others at the base of the great statue

SULLY
That must be the high priest He’s only
one not bowing to Omagua

NATE
They’re not bowing They’re dying

Sure enough the drawings seem to show a progression of
death A hundred dead figures lying beneath Omagua

ELENA
Creepy Why would someone go to all this
trouble if there wasn’t something to this
curse story

SULLY
You don’t get it Curses Warnings
They’re the best friends we ever had
They keep buried treasure buried Ain’t
no curse that isn’t a blessing to us

Sully grabs a seam of the door Nate and Sully pull with
all their might Slowly the huge doors open Elena
extends her torch-- they look inside excitement in their
eyes --

THE CHAMBER IS EMPTY Their grins fall Disappointment
Disillusion Sully kicks a rock at his feet

SULLY (CONTD)
Damnit

But as the rock skitters away it CLANGS against
something metal Nate turns his attention that way and
discovers -- a rusting Spanish HELMET

NATE
Conquistadors

SULLY
I suppose it’s too much to hope they left
a note saying where they took the thing

Nate spots something nearby It’s an ANCHOR

NATE
Actually they may have done better than
that

Nate lifts his torch higher revealing the anchor is
still connected to its chain which LEADS UP TO A SPANISH
GALLEON lodged a hundred feet up in the wall

SULLY
Now that’s something you don’t see every
day What do you make of it

NATE
I don’t know See that standing water --
I think this used to be a cave system
probably led right out to the sea

ELENA
And a cave-in stranded the ship here

Nate notices the ship’s name El Marquez

NATE
The Marquez Where do I know that name
(realization dawns)
Weve got to find the captain’s quarters

Nate climbs up the anchor chain as fast as he can

INT SPANISH GALLEON - GUN DECK- NIGHT

Nate pulls himself into the ship Elena arrives right
behind him leaping to the deck which CREAKS under their
collective weight

NATE
You do know the entire ship could
collapse any second I should be checking
this out alone

Elena pulls out her trusty camcorder from her backpack
ELENA

We have a deal Anything and everything
So get a move on

Nate gets to his feet pulling out his torch and re-
lighting it Once aflame they look around what was a gun
deck The cannons are up against the port wall along with
stacks of waterproof kegs

NATE
My guess is those waterproof kegs are
filled with gunpowder So let’s keep a
healthy distance okay

ELENA
You’re the boss

NATE
That’s right

Nate turns and heads for the stairs leading up to the

quarterdeck when his foot crashes right through a rotten
board He plummets into the hold below

INT THE HOLD - NIGHT

SMACK Nate lands on a pile of something hard in the
darkness the torch lying several feet away Elena stares
down through the hole filming it all

NATE
Really You gotta film this

ELENA
Nate you might not want to look down

Nate grabs the torch and looks He’s lying on a huge pile
of human bones He leaps away

NATE
Jesus

Suddenly Nate hears another strange noise Something
moves beneath the bones

ELENA
What’s going on down there

Nate pulls out his gun as a SOMETHING rises from
underneath the bones

NATE
A rat

HUGE RAT

This is no ordinary rat It’s the size of a pit bull
with massive razor-sharp teeth and blood red eyes

The rat leaps for Nate but he FIRES first riddling the
creature with bullets It falls dead - when suddenly the
bones shift and shudder The hold is SWARMING WITH MORE
RATS some of them with visible bones beneath decayed
flesh They come for Nate

NATE (CONTD)
Get a rope down here Now

INTERCUT NATEELENA
Elena searches for a coil of rope

Nate shoves over one crate and then another trying to
get higher ground as the rats come streaming out of the
bones They’re frenzied attacking each other in order to
get to the fresh meat He FIRES DOWN at them

Elena finds a section of rope and tries tying it off toa
rope cleat nearby The cleat just tears right out of the
rotted floor

NATE (0S) (CONT’D)
Elena

Elena spots a nearby mast and rushes toward it

ELENA
Any second now

But Nate doesn’t have time to spare The swarming rats
force him to the highest corner of the top crate even as
they CHEW APART the lower one with their powerful jaws

The lower crate is practically toothpicks and Nate’s
perch wildly sways above the frenzy of fur and teeth

But just as Nate’s about to fall a ROPE drops down right
in front of him Nate grabs hold swinging as the rats
LEAP UP toward him nipping at his heels

Nate starts climbing the rope -- but so do the rats It’s
a race to the top one Nate barely manages to win He
pulls himself up and SHOOTS the rope causing the rats to
plunge back down into the darkness

ELENA (CONT’D)
Curse No curse There is something very
very wrong here

Nate can only shudder and climb to the quarterdeck

INT CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Elena and Nate enter the room untouched in four hundred
years At the Captain’s desk Nate discovers the mother

lode - maps and charts Elena films over his shoulder as
he examines them

ELENA
What are we looking for

NATE
Do you remember when I read you that
section from Sir Francis’ diary When he
began searching for the map to Omagua
the one ship he could never capture was
the Marquez That’s because its captain
Alvarado had a hidden base he always
escaped to an island called --

ELENA
Isla Oculta

Nate stops flipping through the maps his finger stopping
on a single point in the middle of the southern Pacific
ocean ISLA OCULTA

NATE
Ill bet once Alvarado knew Drake was on
his tail that’s where they took Omagua

Elena grins behind her camera Nate’s radio CRACKLES

SULLY (0S)
What’s going on up there

NATE
(on radio)
We found it Sully Omagua was taken to
an island called Isla Oculta and we’ve
got a map to find it We’re home free

SULLY (0S)
Not exactly Youd better step outside
INT GUN DECK - NIGHT
Nate and Elena look down into the cavern below
NATE’S POV
Sully’s on his knees hands on his head Navarro stands

over him gun to Sully’s head Surrounding him are nearly
a dozen Mestizo thugs

NATE
Shit

Navarro has the radio in his free hand

NAVARRO
(through the radio)
Uh-oh Nate Looks like the natives are
restless You better come on out before
somebody gets hurt

Nate looks around looking for something anything that
will give him an edge

NAVARRO (CONTD)
(through the radio)
You know this is my peoples’ temple
don’t you Nate You know how much it
would pain me to spill Sully’s blood in
here Should I count to five

ELENA
Nate

Finally Nate’s gaze falls on the far side of the gun
deck he sees sealed barrels then back at his torch

INT THE CHAMBER OF OMAGUA - NIGHT

Nate and Elena drop down from the anchor chain and are
immediately surrounded by Navarro’s thugs

NAVARRO
Search him He should have a map on him
showing the way to Isla Oculta

The thugs pat down Nate retrieving the map and his guns
The thug hands the map over to Navarro

ROMAN (0S)
Ill take that

From out of the darkness walks Gabriel Roman wearing
another fine Italian suit and a grin as big as Omagua

NATE
Oh shit

ROMAN
Hello Nathan

ELENA
Another one of your “friends”

Roman give Elena a hint of a bow

ROMAN
Gabriel Roman a distinct pleasure

NATE
Roman doesn’t have friends Just clients
whose money he launders with black market
antiquities Great guys like terrorists
and drug dealers

FRANK (0S)
And the odd museum curator

Frank comes up behind Roman smiling

FRANK (CONTD)
Don’t look so sad dear boy One day all
of our bad deeds will catch up with us
It’s just that today is your day

ROMAN
I don’t envy you your friends Nate
Frank was all too eager to tell me
exactly where to find you And she’s not
the only one to be had for a price Isn’t
that right Sully

The thugs suddenly release Sully who avoids Nate’s eye

NATE
Sully What did you do

SULLY
It’s complicated kid

ELENA
You bastard

Sully doesn’t respond to Elena instead turning to Roman

SULLY
(to Roman)
What about our deal

ROMAN
When I have Omagua you get your reward
But as for Mr Drake I have another deal
with Atog that requires payment in full

Navarro smiles and advances to point blank range

NAVARRO
Looks like you robbed the wrong grave
today hombre This is my heritage If
anybody’s gonna steal it you shoulda
known it’s gonna be me

SULLY
Wait This isn’t part of the deal

ROMAN
Funny thing about your deal Sully I
don’t think Drake’s name ever came up in
negotiations

Roman nods to Navarro Sully bolts up off his knees
Navarro turns and FIRES Catches Sully right in the
heart BOOM Sully goes down and stays down

NATE
NO

Elena is stunned Terrified Roman just finds it funny
ROMAN
What an odd time to turn heroic Well in
for a penny in for a pound Atog --

Suddenly Roman spots a FLASH of light up in the galleon

ROMAN (CONTD)
What is that

GUN DECK - INTERCUT
Nate left his torch within a couple feet of the sealed
barrels one of which he cracked open spilling gunpowder

which the torch’s spreading flames has only just lit

Nate tackles Elena to the ground A second later AN
INFERNO OF AN EXPLOSION ROCKS THE TEMPLE AREA

The entire galleon is reduced to splinters as every
powder keg goes off raining fiery debris everywhere

CUT TO

NAVARRO’S POV

Ears ringing A blinding field of white that slowly fades
as our eyes adjust to darkness Several Mestizo thugs are
on fire rolling around trying to put themselves out

Frank is unconscious Roman is shaken and dazed Sully’s
still dead But Nate and Elena They’re gone Navarro
looks around staring at a huge dying rat in front of
him He smiles secretly to himself then helps Roman up

NAVARRO
I’1l carve him into pieces --

A furious Roman shoves off Navarro’s helping hand

ROMAN
Enough Amateur hour is over
(into his radio)
Drake got away See to it

CUT TO

EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT

Six heavily armed MERCS stand at the entrance to the
mausoleum in front of several black racing MOTORCYCLES
They make Navarro’s thugs look like marshmallows Their
leader pulls out his radio

MERC LEADER
No problem

The merc reaches for his gun only to find it missing
from his holster He turns to see Nate smiling beside
him SMACK He gets a gun butt to the head

The other mercs make the wrong choice and draw Nate
FIRES at point blank range taking down four of them
just before they can shoot him --

But the fifth is behind him and has him dead to rights
BLAM The fifth merc looks surprised as he falls to the
ground dead

Behind him stands Elena smoking gun in her hand She
looks surprised herself

NATE
You okay

ELENA
I don’t know I don’t think so

GUNSHOTS RING OUT Nate looks both ways down the narrow
alleys of the cemetery More mercs race their way

NATE
Let’s go

Nate hops on one of the racing bikes and guns the engine
He spins the bike around doing donuts throwing up a
cloud of dirt in every direction

When the dust clears the mercs have reached each other
but Nate and Elena are gone One of the mercs catches a
glimpse of them down a narrow alley

MERC
Norte Norte

EXT MOTORCYCLE CHASE - NIGHT

The mercs come out of the woodwork as Nate races down
narrow alleys Nate ducks the bike behind a colonnade of
statues as a group opens fire Bullets chew up the
statues as Nate and Elena fly past

More mercs race to the far end of the colonnade only to
get smacked in the face by an airborne bike

But Nate flies right for a stone crypt wall Nate hits
the brakes popping the bike up on its front wheel Its
back wheel spins and lands on the side of a mausoleum
and Nate’s racing off in another direction

That’s when the OTHER BIKE appears The merc driving it
has black motorcycle leathers on and his submachine gun
strapped to the handle bars

AUTOFIRE erupts chewing up the ground around Nate and
Elena Nate looks left and right Nowhere to escape And
up ahead steps leading up to an ornate gothic tomb

NATE
Grab me
ELENA
What
NATE
Grab me tighter than you’ve ever grabbed
anything

Elena squeezes him so hard she surprises him almost
knocking the wind out of him He guns the engine
speeding up heading right for the gothic tomb

More AUTOFIRE A few shots hit the rear fender Nate’s
bike hits the steps At this speed the steps become a
ramp The bike gets massive air --

AND LANDS ATOP THE TOMB The other cyclist skids to a
halt not crazy enough to follow

ELENA
I can’t believe it Now what

NATE
Now what

Nate didn’t think that far The cyclist unstraps his
machine gun Elena looks at the angel statue next to her
She kicks it and it falls over taking out the cyclist

But still mercs close in on the right and the left

NATE GUNS THE ENGINE He leaps his bike off one tomb roof
and onto another picking up speed on an angled roof
then leaping onto the side of a dome He stays above the
narrow alleys of the cemetery as the mercs chase below

ELENA
Nate

Nate looks ahead They’re at the edge of the cemetery A
tall stone wall looms Nate looks for any way to go

And he sees the ARCH A tall archway that holds the
entrance gate to the north end of the cemetery He picks
up speed and jumps for it

The bike lands at a 45 degree angle rear wheel spinning
on the smooth marble arch Is it going to fall

It picks up traction and climbs the arch At its apex

Nate spots two black Range Rovers on the street just
outside A whole other team of mercs aim their weapons
right at him

No time to think Nate picks up more speed They open
fire chewing up the arch their gunfire just trailing
the bike but gaining

Nate flips the steering right the bike sails off the
arch just as the gunfire catches up with it

The bike lands atop the Range Rovers It skips over one
denting the roof slides down the windshield of the
second and lands on the street

The mercs run around to the other side of the Range
Rovers but by the time they get there Nate and Elena are
already around the next corner They’re gone

INT BOAT - NIGHT

Nate packs up the boat stowing away essentials Elena
sits at the table a half drunken bottle of Scotch before
her most of which the two of them clearly drank

Nate downs a shot of Scotch then pours himself another

NATE
To Sully my brother from another mother

He downs the shot and pours one for Elena

ELENA
I can’t drink to that He betrayed you

NATE
Nah You just gotta know Sully is all He
just -- miscalculated the angle

Elena can’t believe what she’s hearing

ELENA
Miscalculated the angle Why am I
surprised You’ve probably spent most of
your life rationalizing his lies

NATE
So with your friends you don’t take the
bad with the good

ELENA
Seems like with Sully you just took the
bad with the bad

Nate pours himself another shot and downs it

NATE
You don’t know what you’re talking about

ELENA
Well maybe that’s because I don’t know
anything about you I’ve had a glimpse in
a duffel bag and that’s about it

Nate slams down the shot glass

NATE
What do you want to hear My sob story
Fine My mother had delusions grand
scale delusions My father was a world
class con artist It didn’t leave a lot
of room for honesty at the dinner table

Nate reaches under the table pulling out a CROSS hidden
beneath For the observant it’s the same cross from the

picture of teenage Nate with Sully

NATE (CONTD)
And your “bad guy” Sully I didn’t know
which way was up and he set me straight
He was the only guy who ever gave a shit
about me

ELENA
I’m sorry I never knew Sully like you
did But I know his philosophy was wrong
You know why I believe in good guys
Nate Because I see people make hard
choices every day

NATE
There you go again --

ELENA
You’re making those same hard choices
Nate That’s why you risked your life to
save mine That’s why you’re not going to
let Roman win

That one stops Nate at least for a moment

NATE
Look at us We got nothing Roman’s got
resources He’s got the manpower And
he’s got the only damn map

ELENA
Bullshit

NATE
You’re drunk

ELENA

I am But it’s still bullshit

Elena spins around her camera and flips open the
viewscreen She turns it to Nate

VIEWSCREEN

The camera follows Nate as he flips through the maps
the Spanish galleon

There it is In sharp HD A perfect video copy of the
precious map to Isla Oculta

NATE AND ELENA

Their eyes meet a moment of electricity passes between
them They move in for their first kiss They’re totally
into it caught up in the moment and each other --

And just as suddenly Nate breaks it off

NATE (CONTD)
I have to say something

ELENA
All you can do is ruin this moment

Nate moves in for the kiss a second time Elena closes
her eyes But again at the last second Nate pulls back

NATE
Sully’s plane It’s the only chance we
have to beat Roman to Isla Oculta

Elena opens her eyes Nate’s already lost in thought She
sighs and goes with it

ELENA
You sure you can fly

NATE
I was a Naval Aviator I was born flying

ELENA
I meant aren’t you too drunk --

Elena drunkenly trips stepping onto the dock smacking
her head as she does so

CUT TO

INT SEA PLANE - DAY

Elena stirs awake in the passenger seat staring out at
the endless blue ocean peeking out beneath a blanket of
clouds She wipes the sleep from her eyes stretching

ELENA
Wow How long was I out for

Just then a massive jolt of TURBULENCE throws the plane
down engine surging Only the seat belts keep Nate and
Elena in their seat

It scares Elena who braces herself on the door frame
Then she notices Nate sweating eyes darting to and fro

NATE
Huh

Elena looks around Blue POST-IT NOTES are affixed
everywhere The one attached to the wheel says “YOKE” On
the airspeed indicator “TOO FAST” and “TOO SLOW” On the
attitude indicator “KEEP THE BLUE PART UP”

Then she spots what Nate’s reading A FLIGHT MANUAL

ELENA
Oh my God You don’t know how to fly a
plane

Nate quickly closes the manual Elena’s worried now

NATE
Of course I do Anyone can fly a plane

ELENA
Are you insane No they can’t There are
some jobs you can bluff your way through
but pilot isn’t one of them Wait -- you
told me you were a Naval Aviator

NATE
Mostly true

ELENA
How How is that mostly true

NATE
Were flying over the ocean aren’t we

Another blast of turbulence sending the plane nose up A
LOUD ALARM SOUNDS A RED LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL

ELENA
What is that

NATE
I’m working on it

He flicks the red light with his finger No change
Another ALARM Another RED LIGHT Nate opens the manual
again flipping through its pages

ELENA
Great I’m going to die because Captain
Ego thinks he can fly a plane halfway
across the Pacific

NATE
Not helping

ELENA
It’s my own fault I knew you were
reckless and irresponsible and let’s
not leave out dangerous

The ALARMS keep blaring as the two argue back and forth

NATE
Watch it I seem to recall blood on your
hands too killer

ELENA
I seem to recall shooting that guy in
order to save your ass

NATE
As if I haven’t been saving yours every
damn moment since we’ve met

ELENA
As if I need your help

NATE
Well you do right now because you don’t
know how to fly a plane

ELENA
Neither do you

Nate opens his mouth to respond but nothing comes
Frustrated he bangs his fist on the instrument panel and
suddenly the alarms go SILENT Nate gives Elena a smirk
and turns away from her

ELENA (CONT’D)
Very mature What are we trying now the
silent treatment

But we can see Nate’s face and he’s not angry anymore
In fact his eyes are wide with excitement

NATE
We’re here

Through a break in the cloud cover they spot a small
island down below

ISLA OCULTA

A small but mountainous volcanic island covered in dense
green jungles

NATE (CONTD)
Hello Isla Oculta

Suddenly the plane is rocked by an EXPLOSION

NATE (CONTD)
Shit

Nate looks at his starboard wing just as half of it
shears off The starboard engine dies out aflame

ELENA
Where the hell did that come from

EXT FREIGHTER - DAY

Roman stands on the deck of a large freighter just off
the island’s coast Next to him is the MERC LEADER
lowering a smoking ROCKET LAUNCHER They watch the
burning plane fall from the sky

MERC LEADER
He’s toast

ROMAN
Any other man and Id agree

INT SEA PLANE - DAY

Nate fights the stick trying to right the plane Elena
trains her camera on the burning engine

ELENA
Just as we have reached the mysterious
Isla Oculta in search of Omagua we have
taken on hostile fire A missile has
destroyed one of our two engines and
threatens to --

NATE
Will you please shut up

He can’t level the plane It’s diving fast All he can do
is pull it out of its spin

NATE (CONTD)
Time to bail

Nate reaches under Elena’s seat and pulls out a
parachute As she struggles to put the pack on he checks
under his seat for his own parachute

BUT THERE’S NOTHING THERE NO PARACHUTE

NATE (CONTD)
Oh boy

Nate ties off the yoke then helps Elena finish buckling
her pack He then pulls her toward the rear cargo door

NATE (CONTD)
Go

Nate opens the cargo door the world racing past outside

ELENA
Wait What about you Where’s your chute

NATE
Do you trust me

Elena thinks about it a sec

ELENA
No Not really

NATE
Good That makes this easier

Nate grabs her chute release handle and pulls on it Her
chute unfurls out the open door

ELENA
You son of a --

And as her parachute fills she’s yanked out of the plane
Nate looks behind the plane and sees her safely
descending toward the island

Nate gets back behind the controls

EXT FREIGHTER - DAY

Roman sees the parachute descending to the island He
sees the plane trying to right itself

ROMAN
Radio Raja The chute is coming his way

MERC LEADER
I can handle it --

ROMAN
No You track the plane Don’t report
back until you have proof the son of a
bitch is dead

INTEXT PLANE - DAY

The seaplane quickly loses altitude dropping down toward
the island’s jungle floor Nate pulls back hard on the
stick fighting to keep the burning plane aloft

NATE
Come on Come on you piece of junk

At the last possible moment the plane banks up and away
its pontoons brushing the top level of jungle canopy
Nate breathes a sigh of relief

NATE (CONTD)
That was close

When suddenly a rock cliff of the volcano comes into
view Nate’s banked the plane right for it

NATE (CONT’D)
No No

Nate pulls on the yoke with all his strength
The plane begins to bank away from the mountain SLAM A

rock outcropping smashes right into the burning engine
knocking it clear off the wing The plane sails on

NATE (CONTD)
Ha Ha And she thought I couldn’t fly a
plane

Nate sniffs the air Something pungent He looks back and
sees that the burning engine has lodged itself in the
tail of the plane The flames advance toward the cockpit

NATE (CONTD)
Come on What do I gotta do for one lousy
break

He turns back to the windshield only to see the jungle
canopy rising to meet him CRASH BLACKOUT

FADE IN

EXT JUNGLE CANOPY - DAY

Nate wakes to find his body is crumpled into a ball
shoved up against the cracked windshield of the plane and
staring at the fifty foot drop to the jungle floor

NATE
Ha I knew I could land it

Sniff Sniff He looks back above him The burning engine
is still perched at the tail teetering like the sword of
Damocles It shifts slipping toward him

NATE (CONTD)
Easy big fella

Nate reaches for the seatbelt strap on the pilot’s chair
tantalizingly just beyond his reach --

When suddenly windshield gives way and SHATTERS
COMPLETELY Nate falls ass first into thin air

Nate flails as he drops completely helpless Just ten
feet from his doom his body impacts a tangle of vines
that absorb his fall They stretch a few break but
enough hold to suspend him just ten feet up

NATE (CONTD)
Whew

Just then the entire plane above shifts The burning
engine smashes through the rest of the windshield a
deadly fireball headed right for him

In a single motion Nate unsheathes his knife and slices
blindly at the vines around him

He cuts all but the one around his leg and swings out of
the way just before the fiery engine flies past him

Swinging upside down held by the vine around his leg
Nate LAUGHS happy to be alive

Then his head hits the tree He HOWLS in pain staring up
at the heavens

NATE (CONTD)
Really Two concussions in two minutes
Youre telling me I really deserve that

The vine holding his leg gives way and he falls head
first to the ground SMACK

Nate sits up dazed Head spinning he looks at the sky

NATE (CONTD)
Message received Thanks

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Nate slogs his way through the thick jungle the
CACOPHONY of the jungle creatures assailing his pounding
head Nate stops glaring up at a CAWING flock of birds

NATE
Would it kill you guys to shut up for
just one minute

As if on command the jungle suddenly goes QUIET Nate
freezes then quickly ducks down beneath a massive
rotting tree trunk

Then we see why the birds quieted Silently working their
way toward Nate’s position are FOUR MERCS heavily armed
each with a radio earplug

Nate pushes himself deeper into shadows as they pass
either side of him As they move on Nate slides around
to the opposite side of the trunk He looks to be clear --
and then the lead merc STOPS
The lead merc raises a fist and they all FREEZE
LEAD MERC
(whispering into radio)
Six oclock Behind the tree

The mercs turn eyes on an area the lead merc identified

NATE

Hidden but blind to the mercs’ movements Nate hears them
move back his way He sweats it out holding his breath

MERCS

Using hand signals they form a pincer around their
target’s position The lead merc steps ahead

LEAD MERC (CONT’D)
(whispering into radio)
I’m gonna flush him out

LEAD MERC

The lead merc creeps around the tree his finger poised
on his machine gun’s trigger As he rounds the tree he
can see a glimpse of his target crouched in the heavy

shadows behind the tree The lead merc grins

But when he finally rounds the tree his eyes go WIDE

LEAD MERC (CONTD)
What the --

His target suddenly LEAPS OUT from behind the tree and
whatever this thing is IT ISN’T NATE

CREATURE

Moving blindingly fast we only catch GLIMPSES of
humanoid form moving on all fours grayish skin talon-
like nails and blood red eyes as the creature RIPS INTO
the unsuspecting lead merc

The lead merc SCREAMS in pain as his chest is slashed
open He gets off one wild salvo of machine gun fire
until his throat is RIPPED OUT by gnashing teeth

The other mercs immediately open fire but confusion
reigns as the creature darts in and out of the shadows
eviscerating the mercs one by one In staccato flashes we
see mortal wounds being inflicted terrified YELLS and
the unearthly GROWL of the inhuman slayer

NATE

Still blind to the unfolding events nonetheless Nate
gets an earful of the one-sided massacre Just when Nate
is tempted to look a DECAPITATED MERC HEAD lands right
beside him Nate’s terrified He BOLTS the other way

EXT CLIFF - DAY

Nate runs full out stumbling over vines daring to look
over his shoulder only to see the jungle rustling behind
him Whatever it is it’s giving chase The sound of
pursuit closes in on him --

When suddenly he bursts out into bright sunlight -- the
jungle simply ends at a steep sea cliff Nate tries to
stop but his momentum takes him over the edge He falls
into open air just managing to grab hold of a root in
the cliff wall preventing him from plummeting hundred of
feet to the rocky coast below

Nate’s frozen panting listening for any pursuit He
hears nothing He pulls himself up so just one eye peers
over the top of the cliff Nothing is there

NATE
Jesus What the hell was that

He climbs back up and notices something in the distance
PORT CITY

Just to the North the same stone and mortar port city
Sir Francis saw four hundred years ago made all the more
ominous by the heavy forest overgrowth that’s entirely
enveloped it keeping it camouflaged over the centuries

But Nate’s attention is quickly drawn to the harbor The
prow of a half-submerged ancient wooden ship lies wrecked
on the rocky shore

Nate pulls out his binoculars zeroing in on the prow
POV - BINOCULARS

Though heavily peeled the ship’s name is still legible
upon the prow THE DEFIANCE

NATE (CONTD)
The Defiance Son of a bitch made it
here Good for you Sir Francis

Then Nate gets a FLASH of red in his eyeline He spots
Elena’s PARACHUTE hanging from one of the port’s towers
But no Elena at the end of the harness

NATE (CONT’D)
Aw crap
And then Nate carefully examines the area spotting a
pair of Pirates trying to be camouflaged watching the
parachute closely A trap

NATE (CONTD)
No Not Eddy

INT SPANISH PORT CITY - TOWER - DAY
Eddy looks at us an intent look on his face

EDDY
Your boy broke rule number one

Eddy glares at Elena who is being held hostage in the
high tower room

ELENA
Yeah Well unless he also broke the law
of gravity I’d say you’re even You saw
the plane go down didn’t you

EDDY
You don’t know the Drake jutek The
man’s survived more falls than Satan
He’s out there Lucky bego probably’s
looking at Omagua right now

ELENA
Om-what

EDDY
Tsk-tsk jutek Why you gotta play games
with poor Eddy Raja

Eddy pulls out Elena’s videocamera and presses play We
hear Elena’s voice from the earlier recording

ELENA (0S)
Just as we have reached the mysterious
Isla Oculta in search of Omagua we have
taken on hostile fire --

Eddy stops the tape Elena gives her best wry smile

ELENA (CONTD)
Can’t blame a girl for trying can you

EDDY
Maybe not But I lost something when that
fat fuck Sully landed a plane on my head

ELENA
What did you lose

Eddy calls over two of his most lethal-looking PIRATES
one of whom hold a giant BOWIE KNIFE

EDDY
My fucking sense of humor Now you tell
me something to get me that statue and
off this sialan island or you’re gonna
start losing fingers

EXT SPANISH PORT CITY - SEA WALL - DAY

The three hundred foot high wall rises from the rocky
coast to the base of the fort’s battlements The
crumbling wall is covered with calcified salt and moss

And halfway between top and bottom hanging by his
fingernails is NATHAN DRAKE

NATE
What the hell am I doing here Why am I
not staring at a twelve ton gold statue
right now

Nate manages to pull himself up to a higher perch He
looks up a long way to go -- and the bricks ahead have
been smoothed flat by the sea No handholds

Nate spots the thinnest of balconies to his right
providing an uneven ladder toward the top of the wall

Nate takes a breath and LEAPS sideways along the wall
He manages to just reach the lowest balcony but he slips
right off just managing to catch himself with one hand

Lungs bursting he looks up -- and the two hundred more
feet of wall he has to climb

INT SPANISH PORT CITY - TOWER - DAY

Two of the Pirates hold Elena and her arm down while Eddy
is positioning a knife to cut off her index finger

ELENA
Wait a minute You can’t do this I’m
just a reporter I need that finger

Eddy brings the knife down toward Elena’s finger

ELENA (CONTD)

Stop I -- I know what’s really going on
the island

The Pirates suddenly freeze looking at each other

PIRATE 1
La Maldida

Elena puts together what he’s talking about

ELENA

The curse It follows Omagua everywhere
it goes

The pirates all turn to each other whispering But
Eddy’s not buying it

EDDY
You don’t know nothing jutek Just the
spanish word for curse

ELENA
Really I was inside the temple of
Omagua Were you

Elena sees the fear in the Pirates’ eyes and her chance
at retaining all her appendages

EDDY
Maybe you tell Eddy Raja what you saw
Maybe you still count to ten

ELENA
A Spanish admiral Alvarado took the
statue of Omagua here The Incas believed
it would kill anyone who touched it

Eddy begins to believe her

EDDY
We found a journal A captain’s log from
the Spanish Scariest shit you ever
heard

NAVARRO (0OS)
Go ahead Eddy Why not tell the reporter
everything she wants to know

Into the room walks Navarro eyes glaring at Eddy The
pirates all step away in fear

NAVARRO (CONTD)

Alvarado said Omagua was cursed by
demons that it possessed his men They
started killing each other Eating each
other So instead of bringing Omagua back
to Spain Alvarado sunk his own fleet to
stop the curse from spreading

ELENA
Really Then where is the statue

Navarro just laughs and grabs the bowie knife from the
pirate holding it He strides toward Elena who backs
away grabbing her camera from the table

NAVARRO
I don’t think so Where is Drake Are you
protecting him Is that it

ELENA
Protecting He blew up my boat left me
stranded and pushed me out of a plane

Navarro gets closer to Elena his fingers tracing the
sharp edge of the bowie knife

NAVARRO
But still here you are trying to work
these idiotas for information I’1l say
this for Drake he slings the finest line
of bullshit the world has ever seen What
he tell you He give you the poor orphan
boy story Or did he sell you the long
lost descendant of Sir Francis line

Elena doesn’t respond Navarro closes the space between
them his chest pushing Elena toward a window behind her
She looks out hoping for somewhere to escape to but
nothing’s out there but a three hundred foot drop

NAVARRO (CONTD)

Just so as you know his real name not
Drake It’s Cruz Personally I like Cruz
better but it don’t quite sell to
reporters as well does it

This one stings

NAVARRO (CONTD)

I’m wasting my time anyway Nathan
probably ditched you just to slow me
down Then again I could use a little
diversion right now

Navarro uses the bowie blade to start cutting a rip in
Elena shirt right between her breasts Elena has nowhere
to go her back against the window

Then Elena hears the SKITTER of rocks just below her --
and SEES NATE HANGING JUST BELOW THE WINDOW

Nate reaches in GRABS ELENA and pulls her out
WALL

Nate holds Elena by the back of her shirt her body
creating a powerful swing of momentum that pulls him

clear off the wall throwing them both sideways

At the last second Nate lets go and Elena flies out of
his grasp landing on a balcony one floor below

BALCONY

Elena rolls to a stop her camera slipping from her grasp
and teetering over the other end of the balcony

ELENA
No

She rushes over to it but before she gets there --

NATE
A little help

She turns Nate’s barely got a hold of the other edge
Stone crumbles in his hands Elena looks at the camera --
at Nate She rushes over and grabs the camera

NATE (CONTD)
Are you kidding me

Nate slips further Just as he loses his handhold Elena
grabs him by the wrist and pulls him up

NATE (CONT’D)
You and I are gonna have a long talk
about priorities

ELENA
I risked my life for this story why
would you think I wouldn’t risk yours

SHOTS RING OUT Navarro sticks his head out the window
above and unloads at them They tumble inside

WINDOW

Navarro fumes as Eddy comes up behind him

EDDY
Damn bangstat Looks like you let them
get away I gotta call this one in to our
banker friend

One of the pirates pulls out a SAT PHONE Navarro SHOOTS
HIM IN THE HEAD He grabs Eddy pinning him to the wall

NAVARRO
Youre afraid of the wrong things Eddy
Youre afraid of Roman and you’re afraid
of the curse when your biggest threat on
this island is me When we find the
statue you’re all gonna beg to be on my
good side Roman most of all So do
yourself the biggest favor of your life
find Drake and kill him

EXT FLOODED CITY - DAY

The upper levels of the buildings rise above the
waterline but street level is completely submerged
creating canals Heavy vegetation has crept in
everywhere trees sprouting from the ancient foundations

Nate and Elena run away from the tower deeper into the
flooded city Hearing Eddy and his pirates YELLING behind
them Nate pulls Elena down for cover behind a low wall

ELENA
You came back for me

NATE
You don’t have to look so surprised

ELENA
I do I really do

Elena follows Nate as he runs to the street canal In the
canal sits a red WAVE RUNNER Nate also spots Eddy and
his men heading their direction

NATE
Ready We’ve got to run for it

Nate reaches the wave runner and turns the engine over
Elena gets on back the pirates’ gunfire riddling the
water with bullets just as the wave runner takes off

WAVE RUNNER

Nate speeds through the canal at full throttle He looks
behind him spotting no pursuit

NATE (CONTD)
I think we’re clear

Suddenly a SPEEDBOAT rounds the corner coming up behind
them Eddy and three of his PIRATES are onboard all
armed with automatic weapons

NATE (CONT’D)
Hang on

Nate turns for cover weaving the wave runner in and out
of sunken archways and tree trunks rising from beneath
the water Bullets WHIZ all around them Then up ahead
the flooded street abruptly ends at a high wall

ELENA
You have the worst luck of anyone I’ve
ever met

NATE

Tell me about it

Nate instinctively turns right only to find them
streaking head on toward the oncoming speed boat

ELENA
Uh Nate

NATE
I know what I’m doing

Nate quickly banks to the left using a fallen arch as a
ramp to jump over a low wall to the next canal over

But the speedboat makes a quick pair of turns getting on
a parallel path to the wave runner The Pirates open
fire decimating the structures between the two crafts

Nate speeds up the wave runner heading toward an
overpass up ahead Just then a pair of PIRATES run out
atop the overpass opening FIRE

NATE (CONTD)
Duck

Nate reaches for the pistol he’s got tucked into his
pants only to have Elena reach around and grab it first

ELENA
You drive bad enough without
multitasking

Elena opens FIRE back at the Pirates taking down one of
them with a shoulder hit But then the other Pirate rises
up again holding a ROCKET LAUNCHER

ELENA (CONT’D)
Nate

NATE
Hold on

The Pirate FIRES the missile streaking toward them Nate
slams the wave runner in reverse jerking it to a halt

The missile submerges in front of them but then EXPLODES
UNDERWATER As the water mushrooms up Nate hits the gas
again and they SOAR UPWARDS over the overpass

The bottom of the wave runner CLIPS the stunned Pirate
sending him tumbling

The wave runner smashes back into the water on the other
side and Nate throttles them forward again Elena notices
a wry grin on his face

ELENA
You were not trying to do that

NATE
You got a better explanation

They round a corner and find themselves facing a massive
building its raised dome rising high above the city

Elena spins as the speedboat rounds a nearby corner Eddy
and the Pirates YELLING as they spot Nate and Elena The
boat speeds toward them

ELENA
What now

Nate looks around but they’ve got nowhere to go He
thinks quickly looking down at the battered wave runner

NATE
Hell burner

Nate takes off his belt and starts wrapping it around the
wave runner’s throttle

ELENA
What

NATE
Get off

Nate doesn’t wait for Elena instead PUSHING her off the
wave runner into the water He then spins the wave
runner toward the oncoming speedboat

The Pirates FIRE away but Nate keeps down long enough to
tie off the controls and send the pilotless wave runner
in the speedboat’s direction

The wave runner and speedboat quickly bear down on each
other The Pirates notice Nate isn’t on the wave runner
too late -- and before they can turn -- BOOM

Wave runner and speedboat collide gas tanks ERUPTING
Men and debris go flying

FLOATING DEBRIS
The remains of the speed boat SMOKE upon the water

Suddenly a hand RISES up out of the water followed by
Eddy’s wild-eyed face He lives on

CUT TO

EXT CUSTOM HOUSE - DOMED ROOFTOP - DUSK

Nate takes off his shirt wringing it dry He notices
Elena quickly eyeing his naked torso with a grin

NATE
A lady wouldn’t look

ELENA
A dead girl would look

From this vantage point Nate and Elena can make out not
only the entire city but the lagoon below

ELENA (CONTD)
So hell burner is some kamikaze thing

NATE
Drake used old ships as floating bombs
against the Spanish Armada I just
updated the technique

Elena’s eyes narrow

ELENA
And you’d be the one to know wouldn’t
you It’s really such a great story the
whole thing about you following in the
footsteps of your famous ancestor

NATE
I guess so

ELENA
What’s to guess Believe me if you take
away the whole Drake connection this
whole news angle becomes a lot less sexy
much less romantic

(beat)

But that’s not a problem for us After
all we got us a real live Drake right

NATE
Sure Let’s get moving Omagua’s waiting

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Nate leads the way nerves jangling as he works through
the jungle There’s a SNAP of a twig nearby and Nate
SPINS unloading a half dozen shots in that direction

ELENA
What is it

Nate looks Nothing there He just shakes his head

ELENA (CONT’D)

People trying to kill you and you’re
cool as a cucumber But one little sound
out here and you’re ready to jump out of
your skin What gives

NATE
It’s nothing Too much coffee maybe

Nate turns and comes face to face with the TORSO OF A
DEAD PIRATE impaled on a tree limb Elena instinctively
SCREAMS and Nate quickly pulls her away

ELENA
What the hell was that

NATE
It’s one of Eddy’s men At least this
one’s got a head

ELENA
Wait What do you mean “this one” You
know something don’t you

NATE
I know a machine gun will come in handy
He takes a MACHINE GUN and ammo off the dead pirate

ELENA
Eddy’s men believed something killed the
Spanish hundreds of years ago Something
that’s still out there They called it La
Maldida -- the Curse Could it be real

Nate is scanning the tree line gun at the ready

NATE
Of course not Keep moving I want to be
out of this jungle ten minutes ago

EXT MONASTERY - DAY

The creek ends at an overgrown Spanish monastery vines
crawling in and around the archways that line the
entrance A handful of the MERCS stand guard

Nate and Elena gaze at the monastery from just out of
sight Nate watches as Navarro walks out from the
monastery and YELLS something at the mercs

ELENA
He doesn’t look happy

Two of the mercs head for a villa beside the monastery

NATE
They haven’t found Omagua yet Not only
am I going to beat them to it but I’m
going to make that asshole pay for Sully

Elena spots movement by the villa as the merc come out
with a MAN walking between them A man she recognizes

ELENA
I think you might want to reconsider

Nate doesn’t understand until the man steps into the
light IT’S SULLY -- bandaged but very much alive

Sully is brought over to a table where a series of maps
are laid out He and Navarro discuss the maps

ELENA (CONTD)
He’s alive

NATE
Good Because I’m gonna kill him

INT MONASTERY CLOISTERS - DAY

A cavernous room lit by torches on wall sconces In the
center of the space Sully stands over a jury rigged
table two sawhorses and a slab of plywood He’s got
dozens of maps laid out on them

There are also three MERCS here One next to Sully and
the other two in the opposite corners of the room The
door opens Nate walks in calm as an Indian cow

NATE
Hello Sully

SULLY
Nate Holy Christmas

The mercs immediately draw their weapons but Nate is
quicker BLAM BLAM Nate plugs the two in each corner

By the time he shifts aim the last guy has his gun out --
and it’s to Sully’s temple

MERC 1
Drop the guns

NATE
Why would I do that

MERC 1
I got a gun on your friend

NATE
Oh that’s why you did that I couldn’t
figure it out Slight correction You’ve
got a gun pointed at the man who sold me
out to your boss

The merc looks at Sully who can only shrug

SULLY
I can explain
NATE
You always can you son of a bitch
SULLY
I had to --
NATE

We were friends I woulda done anything
for you And you stabbed me in the back

SULLY
Come on buddy Don’t get dramatic No
harm no foul

NATE
That’s it If you’re not gonna shoot him
I will

The merc’s spooked He pushes Sully away shifting his
aim at Nate Nate fires first and the merc goes down

SULLY
That was good kid Getting him to let go
of me thinking you wanted me dead
Youve got a future as an actor

Nate just walks over and pulls Sully’s shirt aside
revealing a bandage over his right shoulder

SULLY (CONTD)
Think I staged getting shot kid Now
that really hurts It’s just -- things
are complicated

ELENA (0S)
How complicated can it be Is your cut on
a sliding scale

Sully turns to see Elena entering He stares at Nate

SULLY
You brought the broad

NATE
The broad had a good question What did
it take to sell your best friend out

Sully hangs his head He doesn’t want to say

SULLY
Cecilia

NATE
Who
(Sully mumbles something)
What

SULLY
My wife And Roman’s got her

Elena looks surprised but Nate is apoplectic

NATE
Your wife You’re -- you’re married
What -- how --

SULLY
What happens in Thailand stays in
Thailand

NATE

After all the shit you gave me --

SULLY
Why do you think I did that Because
women are a liability And a guy like
Roman knows how to take advantage of
that Look at me Here I am willing to
throw away a friendship and a fortune
all for a girl Good thing I raised you
better

NATE
So Roman gets Omagua --

SULLY
And I get Cecilia I know not my best
deal If I knew Navarro was planning to
kill you -- I hope taking the bullet
proves that was never part of the deal

Elena folds her arms not sure whether to believe him or
not Nate is even less sure

SULLY (CONTD)
We can still win this thing Nate We
find Omagua and we’d be the one holding
the cards It’d be nice to see that once
before I sailed off into the sunset

Nate sighs realizing what he has to do

NATE
Okay What have you got so far

Elena’s eyes roll When Nate ignores her she shakes her
head and walks away Sully pulls out several of the old
hand drawn maps

SULLY
Tunnels Catacombs See Miles and miles
of them Roman has everyone searching
but nobody’s found the tunnel that leads
to the statue Or if they did they
didn’t live long enough to tell

(MORE )

SULLY (CONTD)
You should know Roman’s already lost
enough men to field a football team For
a while I thought you were maybe to
blame

NATE
Wasn’t me

SULLY
Yeah I figured Something’s out there I
ain’t saying boogeymen but something

Nate looks for Elena who is muttering to herself and
filming the nooks and crannies of the cloisters

NATE
I know what you mean I saw something
Enough to want to wrap this up fast

SULLY
(motioning to Elena)
Itd go faster without the dead weight

NATE
You go before she goes Sully

SULLY
So it’s like that huh Well beggars
can’t be choosers

Nate looks at the map then around the monastery a
moment then back at the map

NATE
So you’re saying they’ve searched in
every direction

SULLY
Yup They’ve practically turned this
whole island upside down looking for it

A realization hits Nate He stabs his finger down in the
middle of the map table

NATE
An entrance to the catacombs is here

Sully squints at that section of map

SULLY
Nate that’s a palm tree

NATE
No Not there

Nate KICKS over the map table His finger points at the
elaborate stone carving on the floor under it

NATE (CONT’D)
Here

Elena hears the noise and returns Sully cocks his head
taking in a WINDROSE on the floor with compass points in
the four main directions

NATE (CONTD)
I noticed it the second I walked in It
bothered me and I didn’t know why The
compass is pointing wrong Upside down

He finds a seam in the stones and ROTATES THE COMPASS
until it points the right way BOOM Something shifts and
suddenly the stones around the compass lower into the
ground at varying heights -- forming a STAIRWELL

SULLY
See that’s what we call teamwork
blondie

ELENA
My real hair color is black Sully Like
your soul

SULLY
Dirty blonde suits you better sweetie

INT CATACOMBS - DAY
A stone subterranean tunnel extends in both directions
Nate’s flashlight illuminates the damp walls as he looks

for identifying marks

SULLY
Say how’d you get here anyway

NATE
Boat

Elena looks at Nate strangely

ELENA
Plane Why do you have to lie about
everything

SULLY

Plane My plane My baby Where is she

Nate shoots Elena a dark look

NATE
Jungle She had a bit of a hard landing

SULLY
How hard

NATE
Granite

Suddenly there’s the SOUND OF GUNFIRE Nate looks up
ahead as the sound of RUNNING draws near Something in
the darkness moving toward them

Nate points his gun ready to pull the trigger when --

One of Eddy’s PIRATES steps into a shaft of light Elena
recognizes him as one of the men assigned to her earlier

PIRATE

This guy doesn’t look right He’s sweating profusely
eyes bugging out He spins turning his gun on Nate

NATE (CONT’D)
Don’t

But the Pirate drops his gun and GRABS HOLD of Nate

PIRATE
Thank god Help me please Get me out of
this place

The Pirate’s knees buckle and Nate helps him to the
floor The Pirate’s back is covered in blood from several
gashing wounds

NATE
What happened

PIRATE
Don’t know One minute I tracking you
through the jungle then I wake up down
here next to the big gold statue

SULLY
Omagua You’re talking about Omagua
Where is it Show us

PIRATE
No We must run They down there

NATE
They Who are you talking about

PIRATE
Them who brought me here

The Pirate spasms in pain His face moves into the
flashlights beam revealing a GREENISH HUE to his pupils

ELENA
Nate -- look at his eyes

SULLY
They’re real pretty who cares He can
lead us to where the statue is

The Pirate’s entire body tenses then falls slack Dead

NATE
Not anymore

Elena pulls Nate away

ELENA
This is bad Nate Everyone on this
island is looking for Omagua and all that
guy wanted to do was run from it

Behind them corpse of the Pirate BEGINS TO MOVE

SULLY
That’s good news in my book One less
sailor looking to dance with our date

Sully turns coming face to face with the once DEAD
PIRATE

The Pirate’s eyes have become crimson red and vacant of
life teeth gnashing in his bloody mouth He grabs for
Sully who gets pushed aside by Nate BLAM BLAM BLAM

Nate puts three shots into the Pirate’s chest but he
keeps coming It isn’t until Nate unloads his entire clip
that he finally goes down

Suddenly they hear another noise seemingly from every
direction It sounds almost like SCRATCHING

SULLY (CONTD)
What the hell is that sound

NATE
Let’s move and hope we never find out

INT DARK CHAMBER - DAY

A large circular chamber with high smooth walls
surrounding it The floor is covered with a heavy wooden
grating that is pockmarked with holes

NATE
It’s a cistern Great A dead end

ELENA
Maybe not I think there’s another level
up there

Elena points to a ladder affixed to one of the walls
just about fifteen feet off the ground

NATE
Get on my shoulders

Elena climbs up Nate’s back clambering up the ladder

ELENA
Looks like there’s an old hoist up here
I’1l try to lower it down for you

As Elena disappears into the darkness Nate and Sully
wait for her down below

EDDY (0S)
Girl’s got skills Nate Honestly where
you find them

Eddy comes out of the darkness machine gun raised

EDDY (CONT’D)
You can run but you can’t hide from old
Eddy Raja Now put down them guns begos

Nate and Sully slowly drop their weapons

EDDY (CONTD)
Thank ya for finding the way into this
place Nate You make Eddy look good

NATE
Eddy we may have bigger problems

EDDY
No shit But I can fix one problem right
now Once I shoot you

Suddenly there’s the SCRATCHING sound again From just
outside the light of the flashlights dark shadows move

EDDY (CONT’D)

What is that

Crawling out of

THE CURSED

the grating comes a grotesque form

WHATEVER THIS THING IS IT ISN’T HUMAN Its skin is grey

and taut the ta
shroud over pure

tters of ancient clothing hanging like a
muscle and bone Its eyes are blood red

Eddy YELLS and unloads with his machine gun ripping

through the crea

ture It goes down Eddy raises his

machine gun in victory

EDDY (CONTD)

Ha Whatever it was it dead now

I don’

NATE
t think it understood you Eddy

On cue the creature rises again Eddy FIRES again and it
goes down But just then SIX more coming up through holes
in the grating and Nate notices one wears a familiar
helmet A Conquistador helmet

SULLY
What the hell are they
NATE
I think they’re -- I think they’re what’s

left of the Conquistadors

What

SULLY
That would make these guys over

four hundred years old

NATE

And they look it

Hey

ELENA (0S)
What are you shooting at

Nate sees Elena pulling the hoist down toward them

NATE

You don’t want to know Hurry up Elena

As the Cursed begin to close in the men close ranks

NATE (CONTD)

Mind if we take back our guns Eddy

EDDY
Be my guest

Nate gives Sully the machine gun and takes back his
revolver The Cursed attack Nate Sully and Eddy open
fire back to back repelling the creatures as they close

EDDY (CONTD)
Nate if we don’t make it out of here I
just want you to know one thing
(beat)
I hate your guts

The three men open fire catching glimpses of the CURSED
in the flare of their muzzle flashes For every one they
shoot TWO more pop up through the holes in the floor

One of the Cursed gets within striking distance of Nate
SLASHING him across the chest before he can put it down
with a gunshot to the chest

With Nate momentarily taken out of the picture one of
the Cursed manages to grab Eddy who drops his machine
gun The creature tries to pull him through the hole in
the floor’s grating

NATE
Hold on Eddy

Nate rushes over and SHOOTS the Cursed holding Eddy in

the forehead but even in death it doesn’t release its

grasp Eddy falls into the hole but Nate grabs hold of
him at the last second He pulls Eddy up to safety

EDDY
Why you save Eddy Raja

NATE
Youre right Probably a mistake

SULLY (0S)
Nate

Nate and Eddy turn around to see Elena has lowered the
hoist low enough for Sully to reach up and grab hold of
the small platform

But at the same time a new host of Cursed close in Nate
and Eddy retreat back toward the hoist FIRING

Nate helps Sully reach up and get onboard the platform
Sully then helps Nate onboard but the ancient hoist
CREAKS under the weight

SULLY (CONTD)
Nate This thing can’t hold much more

NATE
It’ll have to

Nate reaches down his hand for Eddy who is still FIRING
AWAY at the oncoming Cursed Elena pulls on the hoist
lifting them away from the cistern floor

NATE (CONTD)
Take my hand Eddy Come on

Eddy reaches up and Nate grabs hold of his hand With
Eddy still hanging they quickly rise

EDDY
Those fuckers didn’t know who you messin’
with They messin’ with Eddy Raja

Suddenly from out of the darkness below a pair of
Cursed leap up grabbing hold of Eddy’s legs Nate tries
to keep hold of Eddy -- but he’s slipping
NATE
(to Elena)
Elena hurry up

Elena struggles with all her might to keep the taut rope
from slipping from her hands

ELENA
Doing the best I can

Eddy looks at Nate as his arm slips from Nate’s grasp

EDDY
I still don’t like you bego

Eddy slips from Nate’s hands plunging into darkness

INT TUNNEL — DAY

The platform hanging behind them Nate and the others
rush off toward a nearby tunnel even as the Cursed come
climbing up the cistern walls

INT CAVE - DAY
The tunnel ends at a precipice Thirty feet below a

raging RIVER rushes through the cave appearing and
disappearing in holes on opposite walls

SULLY
A goddamn dead end

From behind them they hear the same SCRATCHING sounds as
the Cursed begin to catch up with them

NATE
We don’t have time for a dead end

Fifteen feet away is the crumbling remains of a bridge to
the other side of the cave where another tunnel awaits

Nate takes off on a full run He kicks it into high gear
leaping -- no throwing his body into the air legs and
arms pumping fighting for each and every extra inch

SMACK He lands and shoulder rolls skidding to a stop
He turns back around his chest burning with pain

NATE (CONTD)
Elena Sully Jump

But before they can jump the Cursed arrive smashing
into Sully and Elena All tumble into the raging water

NATE (CONTD)
Aw hell --

NATE DIVES IN AFTER ELENA AND SULLY

INT UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Nate rockets into the water only to see the Cursed
attacking Sully and Elena He grabs the one attacking
Elena by the head and twists it violently CRACK It
goes limp and lets go of her

But the current pulls them toward the dark tunnel
leading who knows where Nate grabs a rock on the edge of
the tunnel with one hand and Elena with the other

He struggles to keep them from disappearing into the
blackness -- but he can only watch as the other Cursed
cuts into Sully with its razor sharp claws Sully tries
to swim away but the thing’s too fast It wraps him up
in its legs moving in to finish him

Nate makes a tough call HE LETS GO OF ELENA In one
motion he draws his gun and FIRES

The bullet rockets through the water piercing the brain
pan of the Cursed and it goes limp releasing Sully
Sully slams into Nate They all disappear into darkness

NATE’S POV

We hear sounds of BUBBLES RUSHING WATER MUTED SCREAMS
but we see nothing but blackness --

Until just a sliver of dull light flashes before us
COUGHING GASPING BREATHS
INT SMALL CAVE - DAY

A small narrow cave Nate pulls himself out of the
raging river on his knees climbing over sharp rocks

Why Because in his left hand is Sully In his right
Elena He hauls them up onto this sliver of dry land and
Sully immediately coughs up a gallon of river water

Elena doesn’t move Nate immediately begins chest
compressions Then puts his mouth over hers and blows

COUGHING Elena spits up water and revives She looks in
Nate’s eyes hovering above her

ELENA
You came for me

NATE
You keep being surprised by that

ELENA
Not anymore

She reaches a hand up and pulls Nate down to her
planting a kiss on his lips Sully GROANS

SULLY
I’m wet I’m sliced up I’m halfway to
dead so don’t make me feel like a high
school chaperone to boot

Nate helps Elena up then pulls out a propane lighter
illuminating the dark cave Then Nate notices something
in the shadows by the wall

A SKELETON
Propped up against the wall the figure is still dressed
in the tatters of clothing In its lap sits a small

leather journal

NATE
No way

Nate pulls out the Drake journal Compares it The
skeleton has the same journal with the Drake crest
pressed into its leather cover

ELENA
Is it --

NATE
It’s Drake

Nate lifts the journal from the skeleton’s hands

NATE (CONTD)
And this is the real last journal

He wipes off four hundred years of dust and opens it to
where the ribbon bookmark lies

NATE (CONT’D)
My end is near The devils hunt for me in
the darkness I will chose my own fate
rather than lose my soul to Omagua The
Spaniards have unleashed hell and become
as demons My men are all dead leaving
the task to me alone No ship will depart
this island A thing of such great evil
must never leave these shores In my
final hour I only hope I have found
redemption for life misspent

Nate turns the journal to its final half-written page

NATE (CONTD)
To the man who finds this last testament
I charge you with the mission I could not
fulfill Destroy Omagua Bury its curse
forever And should you recover my map
case deliver it to my most faithful
Cross The only true treasure of my life
is in Cross’s care There is nothing more
for me --

SULLY
Nothing more what

NATE
That’s it That’s all it says I think he
died writing it

ELENA
So what now

Nate doesn’t answer his mind reeling

SULLY
That doesn’t change a thing What he
wrote in there High octane bullshit He
probably had dengue fever

ELENA
Don’t Don’t you try and poison Nate with
your easy cynicism This changes things

SULLY
Here we go --

ELENA
Nate it’s like when you saved that dog
You made the right choice And when you
dove in to save me --

NATE
Dog What dog

ELENA
In Sri Lanka

Nate looks puzzled Sully knows what’s coming

NATE
I’ve never been to Sri Lanka

Now Elena’s puzzled until she turns on Sully

ELENA
You slimy bastard Is there anything
about you two that isn’t a lie

NATE
Wait a minute --

She points at the skeleton of Sir Francis

ELENA
Are you even related to him

SULLY
Not this again --

ELENA
No We deal with this now I want to know
if I’m wasting my time even trying to
locate his conscience
(to Nate)
Please be honest with me just this once
Are you related to Sir Francis or not
Yes

SULLY NATE
No

Nate takes a deep breath pulling the ring off his neck

NATE
My mother believed we were related to Sir
Francis Drake That Drake had a Spanish
lover and she bore his child That
running through our veins was nobility
Heroism And my father used that to con
her of every penny she had stringing her
along with the trinket of the month and
bogus Drake research And when he left us
with nothing even as we scraped to just
get by she just believed it more She
needed it so bad she even changed our
name from Cruz to Drake

ELENA
And you believed it too

SULLY
Part of him still does

NATE SULLY
Yes

NATE
You grow up thinking all these stories
mean something it’s hard to let go But
Sully set me straight Sir Francis didn’t
have any heirs His line died with him
Anything else is just rumor

ELENA
So you turned it around living the lie
to your own advantage

NATE
Trust me nobody wants to invest in
Nathan Cruz But Nathan Drake --

ELENA
What about the ring

NATE
I stole it from a museum

Elena shakes her head equally sad and disappointed

ELENA
Did you ever tell your mother the truth

NATE
I couldn’t It was all she had

Nate takes the ring and puts it around Drake’s skeletal
finger Just then a BIRD flies down into the cave
SQUAWKING at our characters

NATE (CONTD)
However that bird got in here that’s our
way out

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

A set of rocks split apart by a thin subterranean chasm
Sully is the last to pull himself out of the chasm only
to discover the wreck of his plane lying nearby

SULLY
No No no no How could you

Nate stands nearby Drake’s journal open revealing a
intricately drawn map

NATE
I’1l make it up to you Turns out we were
practically standing right on top of it
all along Omagua’s not in the catacombs
It’s hidden beneath the custom house

EXT CUSTOM HOUSE - DAY

The inside of the domed structure beams with light from
holes in the ceiling In the center of the room a thick
stone tablet covers a section of the floor

NATE
Help me out

Sully and Nate pull aside the tablet There’s a GROANING
sound and a dais suddenly rises pushing aside six
hundred years of dirt and dust And beneath the dais lies

OMAGUA
It’s even more amazing in person Nearly thirty feet
high and made of pure shining gold adorned with the

strange and terrifying faces of gods long forgotten

ELENA
Oh my god It’s huge
SULLY
If I had a dime for every time --

Elena shoots him a look that could kill

NATE
How the hell do we get this out of here

NAVARRO (0OS)
Let us handle that

They turn to see Navarro smiling alongside at least a
dozen of his Mestizo thugs They’re surrounded

NAVARRO (CONTD)
Congratulations Nate You found Omagua
For me

CUT TO

INT CUSTOM HOUSE - LATER

All three of them are on their knees hands behind their
heads with three rifles trained on each of them Navarro

crouches down so he can look Nate in the eye

NAVARRO
You truly are a dog with a bone my
friend I can’t imagine being you
Getting this far and failing just ten
feet from success

NATE
Youre the dog Atoq You just fetched
this for your master You’re just in it
for a few table scraps

Rage flares behind Navarro’s eyes but he quells it

NAVARRO
You still think this is all about Roman
don’t you You still think this is about
gold You and Roman are the same
Conquistadors in different clothes
Gringos searching for something they
can’t begin to understand

NATE
And I take it you’re the native who is
going to enlighten us

NAVARRO
Thats why you’re still alive hombre So
you can see my endgame

Roman enters with his mercs a huge smile on his face

ROMAN
It’s bigger than even I imagined

NAVARRO
Must be big It was built to bury a god

Roman notices the captives on their knees

ROMAN
What are they doing alive

SULLY
Hey wait a minute We had a deal Roman

ROMAN
I don’t see you handing me Omagua Sully
Looks like you’ve run out of angles
(to Navarro)
Call in the helicopter I want this
netted and on the freighter now

NAVARRO
Really

Roman stops Turns to Navarro

ROMAN
Why Would you recommend another course
of action

NAVARRO
Like I said it was built to house a god
I thought you’d want to be the first to
have a look inside

ROMAN
Inside

Meanwhile Nate Sully and Elena whisper to each other

ELENA
What’s going on

NATE
Nothing good

SULLY
You’re telling me He welched on our
deal You just can’t trust anybody
anymore

NATE
For a man who’s losing the love of his
life you don’t seem too broken up

SULLY
What -- oh yeah Sonia

NATE
Cecilia Oh no

ELENA
Of course

NATE
You lied to me About that Sully you
son of a bitch Why Why’d you sell me
out

SULLY
Because you were never supposed to find
anything That’s why

NATE
What

SULLY
How many years have you been searching
for Drake And what did you have to show
for it Two things jack and squat So
when Roman calls me and offers to pay off
all my markers and all I gotta do is
give him your Drake leads I thought it
was the easiest money I I mean we were
ever gonna see I thought I was scamming
him How the hell was I supposed to know
youd actually find the thing

NATE
You bet on me to fail

SULLY
I played the odds kid Maybe if I played
the odds a little more I wouldn’t have
owed guys like Roman Figures the one
time I bet against you the long shot

pays

ELENA
You are an unbelievable asshole Sully

SULLY
I am aware

Roman draws closer to the statue

ROMAN
What’s inside

NAVARRO
My people say that what was inside Omagua
would make the statue itself seem as
worthless as sand

Roman walks up to the massive statue dwarfed by its
size Reaching around he finds a seam in its side He
pulls at it the ancient hinges GROANING as the thirty
foot high lid swings open Inside --

MUMMIFIED CORPSE

A terrifying vision skin pulled taught around its
skeletal features hands clawing in agony mouth still
pulled wide in an ancient scream

Navarro smiles knowingly catching Nate’s eye

NAVARRO (CONTD)
Now for the fun part

As Roman leans in for a closer look a soft wind blows
over the exposed mummy The wind stirs up a GREENISH DUST
from the rotting form which Roman inadvertently inhales
He immediately begins to violently cough

Roman slams the lid shut as he falls to his knees

ROMAN
Navarro --

His back to the others Roman SCREAMS in anguish as his
skin bubbles like a cauldron his muscles constricting so
powerfully that his bones splinter and crack

When he finally turns around his eyes have turned blood
red his features pulled tight in animalistic rage He is
the CURSED

Roman lets out a piercing SHRIEK and charges toward
Navarro Navarro waits until he’s practically on top of
him then simply FIRES a bullet into Roman’s head

NAVARRO
Adios hefe

Roman falls dead The shocked MERCS are quickly GUNNED
DOWN by Navarro’s thugs

NAVARRO (CONTD)
(to the thugs)
Get the netting around the statue now

The thugs quickly move into action covering their mouths

with their shirts as Navarro turns back toward Nate

NATE
Omagua isn’t the statue of gold it’s
what’s inside it That corpse it’s the
high priest isn’t it

NAVARRO

(grinning)
You and Roman were chasing trinkets
Glittery metal and beads I was
reclaiming history Finishing the job
Atahualapa started He wasn’t just going
to pay a ransom you know He was going
to show the conquistadors the anger of
the gods themselves He was going to lay
this curse upon them But his men never
made it back to him They changed the
curse spread and his own people
perished

NATE
Youre going to use the curse

NAVARRO
Do you have any idea of what the fear of
this is worth in the hands of a man
unafraid to use it My people lost four
hundred years ago Today they’re gonna
win

NATE
Either that or you’re batshit insane and
about to die

Navarro just laughs in Nate’s face He levels his

revolver at Nate’s head But suddenly a loud sound

resounds off the domed walls SCRATCHING

THE CURSED

Crawling out through every nook and cranny comes a horde

of the undead creatures They immediately leap on the

Mestizo thugs who FIRE BACK desperately A battle rages

Navarro is forced to turn his attention from Nate to
Omagua which is only partially bound in the netting

NAVARRO
(to the thugs)
Finish loading the statue Hurry

Navarro opens fire on the Cursed that charge the statue
The Mestizo thugs watching Nate Sully and Elena are also
distracted Nate and Sully take advantage spinning and
knocking them out with a pair of punches They take the
thugs’ weapons

The rest of the mercs don’t even notice too busy mowing
down the hordes of advancing cursed

SULLY
Come on Eddy’s boat is close

Nate’s eyes are glued to Omagua even as more Cursed
stream in beginning to overwhelm the outnumbered Mestizo
thugs Elena grabs Nate’s arm

ELENA
They’re dead Let’s not be them

Nate gives Omagua one last look and they rush out taking
out a pair of Mestizo thugs on the way

EXT FLOODED STREET - DAY

Nestled between two buildings the motorboat has been
camouflaged by vegetation Sully is the first to arrive
pulling the vines aside Not only does he find the
motorboat ready to go but he also finds CRATES filled
with various gold and jewel encrusted SPANISH RELICS

SULLY
Bless that slimy Indonesian bastard
Looks like we’re gonna do just fine from
our wild goose chase

Nate and Elena get on board Nate fires up the engine
which ROARS to life The boat heads out to sea

Just then there’s the sound of WHIRRING and Nate spots
the helicopter arriving at the custom house

NATE
No

A moment later the helicopter begins to rise LIFTING
THE BOUND OMAGUA out of the domed structure Nate can see
Navarro in the cockpit next to the pilot

Nate pilots the boat closer to the canal wall

SULLY
What are you doing

NATE
Sully take the wheel

SULLY
Don’t even think about it We’re rich
enough with this haul

NATE
It’s not about the money Sully

Nate’s hand absently goes down to his chest where
Drake’s ring once hung -- but there’s nothing there now

NATE (CONT’D)
If Navarro makes it to the freighter
that curse gets out I’m not going to let
that happen

Nate jumps off the boat and takes off toward the custom
house Sully grimaces at Elena

SULLY
Nice work blondie Your big ideas
probably just killed my best friend

Sully pushes the throttle to full knocking Elena back
NATE

Runs full bore tracking the helicopter as it banks over
the flooded city statue hanging underneath The
helicopter stays low unable to get much altitude with
the massive weight beneath it

Nate spots a JEEP at the edge of the city He jumps into
it The keys are in it He starts it and races off after
the helicopter

JEEP

Swerves in and out of trees as it races along the
coastline Nate actually gains on the helicopter

And that’s when the Cursed come for him Hundreds of
them they pour out of the dark treeline ahead racing
impossibly fast heading right for Nate

Nate keeps one hand on the wheel while the other grabs
the SUBMACHINE GUN on the passenger seat and picks off
the cursed as they try to jump on the jeep

A few land on the back Nate ducks and hits the BRAKES
They fly over the windshield Nate presses the gas again
and runs them over

Ahead the helicopter is slowly gaining altitude as it
approaches a hill Nate guns the engine racing up the
hill after it

Two Cursed jump on the back of the jeep Nate turns to
fire at them --

CLICK Empty He ducks as they swipe at him And then he
sees that what’s ahead is not a hill at all

IT’S A CLIFF Nothing ahead but a two hundred foot drop
to the rocky shore Nate jams the empty machine gun
against the accelerator The jeep races for the cliff
and the helicopter that is now tantalizingly close

The cursed attack They knock Nate through the windshield
and onto the hood Nate kicks one in the face

He turns The cliff is right here He crouches

AND JUST AS THE JEEP SHOOTS OFF THE CLIFF NATE LEAPS as
high and as far as he can arms windmilling searching
for something to grab

SLAM

Nate jams one hand inside the netting at the bottom of
Omagua and holds on for dear life

INT HELICOPTER - DUSK

Navarro hears Nate crash into the statue He looks down
and spots Nate near the base of Omagua

NAVARRO
Dog with a bone

Leaning out the door keeping hold with one hand Navarro
opens fire with his revolver Nate just manages to swing
hand over hand to the under side of the statue

NAVARRO (CONTD)
Damn it

Navarro starts climbing down the wire toward Nate
NATE

Reaching the other side of the statue Nate spots a dead
merc trapped in the netting twenty feet above him A
holstered revolver is still strapped to the merc’s leg

Nate starts climbing upwards Rung by rung he finally
reaches the holster and pulls out the revolver BLAM

Nate takes a shot in his other shoulder as up above
Navarro has climbed up and around to this side Nate
nearly lets go and he’s forced to drop the revolver to
use that arm to stay atop the statue

Luckily Navarro’ shooting angle is now blocked by the
dead merc’s body

NAVARRO (CONTD)
You should have just let me go Nate
This hero stuff just doesn’t suit you

NATE
No kidding

Just then Nate spots a BOWIE KNIFE attached to the
merc’s body armor He grabs it and looping his legs into
the netting starts CUTTING away at the netting below
NAVARRO

The entire statue SHIFTS DOWNWARDS as the netting below
weakens Navarro quickly realizes what Nate is doing

NAVARRO
No

Navarro holsters his gun and start climbing downwards
NATE

Cuts furiously away at the netting until Navarro reaches
him KICKING at Nate’s legs trying to knock him loose
Nate pulls himself up and the two fight hand to hand

Two men pound away at each other from close quarters

each trying to keep hold of netting as the midnight blue
of the deep sea speeds by below them

With his bad shoulder Nate is getting the worst of it
He finally starts climbing up and away from Navarro

NAVARRO (CONTD)
Running away Nate

Navarro clambers after him Nate reaches the top of the
netting where the rope binds Omagua to the helicopter’s
lifting hook

Nate smiles down at Navarro whose hand has gotten stuck
in the netting

NATE
You want Omagua so bad Atog You can
have it

Nate starts cutting the rope

NAVARRO
Stop That water is two thousand feet
deep If you cut that rope you won’t be
able to get the statue back No one will

NATE
That’s the idea Adios Atoq

Nate finishes cutting the rope and the giant statue falls
to the water Navarro still clinging to it

OCEAN

The gargantuan statue crashes into the ocean drifting
down with Navarro stuck to its side like Ahab to Moby
Dick disappearing into the blackness of the deep

NATE

Clinging to the helicopter’s hook he hears YELLING He
looks up to see the helicopter PILOT pointing at him

motioning to a pair of Mestizo thugs atop the freighter

PILOT
Shoot him

The helicopter dives to give the thugs an easier shot
FREIGHTER
One of the Mestizo thugs pulls out a rifle and takes aim

He’s got Nate square in his sights when a rifle butt
CRACKS him from behind

Elena grins from the delivering end of the rifle Behind
her we can see Eddy’s boat bobbing beside the freighter

ELENA
You got this Sully

Sully steps up carrying the surface to air launcher used
against his plane earlier

SULLY
This is for shooting down my baby

Sully LAUNCHES THE ROCKET which streams out toward the
helicopter EXPLODING IT INTO A MILLIONS PIECES

NATE

Leaps off the hook just as the helicopter above him
EXPLODES He tucks his arms in and knifes down into the
ocean water the flaming remains of the helicopter
splashing down nearby

Elena looks concerned Sully just shrugs

SULLY (CONTD)
What Too much

COUGHING They turn and see Nate bobbing among the
wreckage Smiles all around

CUT TO

EXT FREIGHTER - DECK - LATER

Sully’s laid out their treasure haul from Eddy’s boat
Not a bad assortment of trinkets No mother lode but not
bad at all

Sully’s already polishing a gold urn examining it to
determine its value

In the distance the island is slowly disappearing behind
the ship Nate bandages himself Elena reviews footage on
her videocamera’s screen Nate jumping off the boat

NATE (0S)
If Navarro makes it to the freighter
that curse gets out I’m not going to let
that happen

She stops the playback Frowns Nate notices

NATE (CONTD)
Everything okay

Elena looks down at her precious camera -- THEN FLINGS IT
OVER THE SIDE OF THE FREIGHTER

NATE (CONTD)
Why’d you do that

ELENA
I tell my story and how long before every
wreck diver in the world is swarming
around here But you are gonna make it up
to me Nate We’re gonna tell a new
story Personal redemption Boy who grew
up believing he was a Drake ends up
fulfilling Drake’s dying wish minus the
mention of Omagua of course

NATE
No one will buy it

ELENA
Theyll buy it because I’m selling it
And because it’s true I hate to tell you
this Nate -- but I think you just became
one of the good guys

Nate smiles

NATE
Whatever I can’t stop you from writing
this any way you choose

ELENA
That’s right And if I’m going to make
this a character piece I’m going to need
to know my subject inside and out

NATE
In depth

ELENA
Extremely Up close and personal

Sully reaches into one of the crates pulling out a
MAP BOX
A long rectangular wooden box a familiar seal upon it’s

cover one we recognize from the journal The seal of SIR
FRANCIS

SULLY
Nate Come take a look at this

Nate tears himself away from Elena for a moment

NATE
I don’t believe it

Nate looks for a way to open it but he only finds one
ring-shaped indentation It has the symbol of a flame

NATE (CONTD)
Damnit Looks like it needs the Drake
Ring

ELENA
Why is that a problem

NATE
Why Because the damn ring is --

He turns and sees Elena dangling something on a rawhide
string The Drake ring

NATE (CONTD)
You took it back from Sir Francis

ELENA
I had a feeling you might earn it

Nate takes the ring and fits it into the slot Section by
section the intricate puzzle box slides and shifts until
it opens

Only there is no map inside All that is inside is an
ornate bejeweled BABY RATTLE

Nate pulls it out staring at it confused
ELENA (CONTD)
Oh my God Nate The inscription on the

box cover

WE MOVE IN ON a gold plate on the inside cover of the
box The inscription reads

For Isabella Cruz
The guide to my stars

SULLY
Who is Isabella Cruz

ELENA
Cross Cruz Wait --

Nate is shell shocked

SULLY
Now let’s not go down that road again

Nate snaps out of it

NATE
Coincidence Gotta be

ELENA
You sure

As Nate wrestles with the answer Elena grabs him by the
shirt

ELENA (CONT’D)
It doesn’t matter You’re still my story -
- and you’ve got an exclusive to deliver

With that Nate swoops Elena up and carries her off
toward the staterooms the setting sun descending in the
distance

FADE TO BLACK
