EXT COASTAL WATERS - DAWN
Grey skies Desaturated daylight

Slack tidal waters heave gently under a blanket of heavy
mist A wooden FISHING SCOW gradually takes shape

Superimposure OCTOBER 1939 HOBART TASMANIA

Four aboriginal Australian FISHERMEN are on board hauling
in a net Silvery fish flop in the bilge as the men transfer
the bountifui catch into an icefilled hold

One of the fishermen suddenly sees something The chatter
and work comé to a stop

Silence Except for the thumping of the dying fish gulping

for air

ANOTHER ANGLE

With infinite slowness a huge derelict WHALER floats into

view listing heavily Its half-exposed bottom encrusted in

barnacles and rust the hulk dwarfs the fishing boat

High on one side is a faded name Arkham

ON BOARD - LATER

THUNK - a grappling hook sails over the rail and lands on
the main deck

An Australian PATROL BOAT has drawn alongside A dozen
SAILORS climb onto the wreck fully armed

EXTERIOR DECKS

The hatches and windows are smashed the wheelhouse crushed
Bloodstains blacken the decks the stairs and ladders have
been torn out and twisted

At the stern a faded AMERICAN FLAG hangs in tatters

The boarding party fans out wordlessly awed by the

destruction The men switch on their torches and peer down
the stairs Water everywhere

BELOW DECKS

CRASH - A steel floor collapses landing a SEAMAN waist-
deep in rusty water one level down

The sailors wade through tilting corridors stopping te gawk
at a cluster of MUMMIFIED DOGS fused onto a hatchway The
snarling teeth shine in the dim light

IN A STATEROOM

A LIEUTENANT COMMANDER examines a shelf stacked with 35mm
film cans A handwritten label reads

MISKATONIC UNIVERSITY ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION 1930”

LIEUTENANT COMMANDER
Nineteen-thirty

The officer puts the cans inte a leather pouch

CORRIDOR

Up ahead a storeroom One of the men tries the door shut
tight As the Lieutenant Commander approaches

SAILGR
It’s locked from inside sir

With a hunk of scrap metal the officer bashes on the lock

INSTDE
Pushing aside floating crates and planks they play their
lights over the riveted bulkheads which are scratched and
buckled
SEAMAN
(seeing something
Oh- Blimey great God almighty-

The Lieutenant Commander follows his gaze-

THE MADMAN

Panting wild-eyed a crouching old man stares madly at
them
Chin-deep in the rusty water his pale features and dry skin
are in sharp contrast with his glittering wide-open eyes

Nee

SEAMAN
Can you understand me sir If you can
just nod your head

The SEAMAN approaches-

SEAMAN (CONTD)
(approaching cautiously)
Sir Dont be afraid were here to help
you- sir-

The seaman stops becoming aware that the rotted remains of
a HUMAN BEING are glued to one of the bulkheads
Disbelieving he moves for a closer look

Suddenly screaming the lunatic stands revealing in his
hands a rusty fire AX

WILD MAN
Don’t touch him

With a brutal blow he sinks the ax deep into the seamans

chest As the water reddens other sailors leap onto hin

but he shakes them off and chops again catching one man in a
the back ‘

BANG - The Lieutenant Commander leans in from the doorway
his gun smoking aiming for a second shot

The madman drops to his knees» his grimace exposing hideous
broken teeth

His wild hair is yellow gray and a long scraggy beard
conceals gaunt features His bulging terrified eyes are
pale blue He touches the spreading bloodstain on his filthy
coat and stares at his reddened hand

WILD MAN (CONT’D)
A gun- You- shot me- my blood-
(a gory smile)
-I°m back-

With a sigh he falls face forward into the water The men
close in

CUT TO
EXT HOBART DOCKS - DAY

Bright sunshine warms the docks at Sullivans Cove Hobart’s
busy harbor The Union Jack is everywhere as ENGLISH
SAILORS provision a sturdy freighter HMS MOONSTONE

They load water barrels crates of fresh food Sailors carry
a couple of dog sleds up the gangway

The bemedaled ship’s captain ALAN STARKWEATHER a no-
nonsense ruddy-faced veteran walks briskly down the dock
followed by his WARRANT OFFICER He signs a few forms and
‘climbs into a shiny black BENTLEY its fenders decorated
with consular flags

EXT HOBART STREETS - DAY

A CHAUFFEUR drives the Bentley through the colonial-era
streets where uniformed British and Australian soldiers
mingle with colorfully-dressed natives

IN THE BENTLEY

Starkweather and the local BRITISH CONSUL are seated in the
rear of the car

CONSUL
Youre how close then Captain
Starkweather

STARKWEATHER
Two days and counting sir If the
weather holds

CONSUL
You ever hear of the Arkham

The CONSUL hands him a sealed package

STARKWEATHER

(surprised)
Lost at sea almost a decade ago- along
with her sister ship the Miskatonic

Starkweather opens the package maps memos and the 35mm
film cans from the ship
CONSUL

She just fetched up here last night

EXT MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

The Bentley sweeps past manicured lawns palm trees and
colorful flower beds It parks at the main entrance where
Starkweather and the Consul get out

A pair of uniformed sentries salutes smartly as the men
enter the building

HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Steel bars its the prison ward Starkweather and the
Consul follow the HOSPITAL DIRECTOR

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
I must remind you gentlemen that
despite the patients sedation we
consider him extremely dangerous
(beat)
Two men are dead one in grave condition
We had to amputate an arm

STARKWEATHER
The corpse on board Has it been
autopsied

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
(nods)
Shotgun wound

He opens another door Starkweather stares in amazement

INT SHOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The madman is propped up on a stool his bony shoulder
swathed in bandages He’s shackled to the white-tiled walls
with long chains fastened to his neck wrists and ankles

Buriy uniformed SENTRIES stand guard as two ORDERLIES
cautiously cut the man’s fingernails and hair

STARKWEATHER
Good Lord Bo you know his name

Noa
CONSUL
Im afraid not He hasn’t said a word

Starkweather sits down opposite the man and studies his
gaunt features

STARKWEATHER
Sprechen sie deutsch - Vous pariez
frangais

No response

HOSPITAL DIRECTOR
Weve been through all that I say hes a
Yank

The Consul comes over to him

CONSUL
The Admiralty feels that given your
destination it‘s essential you look into
it Before you sail you understand

Starkweather can’t conceal his impatience

STARKWEATHER
(to the Consul)
Im hardly in a position to - to get
involved with this-
(beat)
With Hitler in Poland my timetable is
even more urgent I have to reach
Antarctica by-

FWAPPPP The stranger wraps a bony hand around
Starkweather’s arm Starkweather grimaces it hurts

STRANGER
Not- Antarctica

The man‘s grip is like steel
STRANGER (CONTD)
(hoarse whisper)

You must not go-

STARKWEATHER
I say Sir let go -— now-

The stranger gulps back tears and looks at the other men
barely able to control his voice
STRANGER
You mustnot-sail to Antarctica-

The man totters to a mirror dragging his chains

He leans close to the mirror Pulling back his long hair he
touches his face aghast

STARKWEATHER
Could you be more specific sir about
your warning- sir

STRANGER
(agitated)
Wh- what year is it
CONSUL

STRANGER
(awestruck)
19392

AT THE MIRROR

The stranger twitches in horror as something moves beneath
his skin A faint jagged fissure opens His fingers
elongate and undulate suddenly devoid of cartilage or bone

STRANGER
No-

In a brutal sudden SHOCK CUT his face and chest extrude
into a mass of hungry wet pseudopods that whip wildly in
the airt

Howling the stranger turns away

And then -just as suddenly- his appearance reverts to
nermal

BACK TO SCENE
The other men stare at him

STARKWEATHER
What’s wrong

STRANGER
Did you see it Did I change I
cannot trust my eyes- my mind-

aa
He grows increasingly distraught yanking at his chains

STRANGER (CONT’D)
If 1 change- if I do you must kill me
you hear You must kill me Or I will
infect the world

The sentries restrain him Starkweather approaches

EXT MISKATONIC CAMPUS - NIGHT
Flashback

CAMERA pulls back from young WILLIAM DYER At 25 wearing a
tuxedo hes almost unrecognizably healthy and handsome

A party is underway in a FLOWER GARDEN where prosperous New
England DONORS and FACULTY mingle under festive paper
lanterns In the background the imposing red brick
buildings of the university

DYER (V0)
I was handpicked for the voyage by Dr
Gilman Lake chairman of the biology

cranking his 35mm motion picture camera His little brother
PIP 17 is ready with an extra film magazine

GEDNEY
Come on Professor Lake Say something
I’m running out of film

Pip laughs and the crowd applauds as Lake takes the
microphone

LAKE
Our trip will be one of discovery
Antarctica promises rich fossil records
and with them important clues to the
origin of all species

Danforth notices a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN standing in the
shadows under an elm tree He nudges Dyer who abruptly
leaves the line-up

LAKE (CONTD)
(noticing this)
In fact were seeking our place in the
evolutionary ladder- and answers to age-
old questions as to our very nature

EXT GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER
At the margins of the campus the woman is walking away

As Dyer catches up with her she turns to face him She
visibly pregnant

Professor Lake There is something- we
need to talk About my participation-

Lake takes Dyer aside Hands him a drink

LAKE
(smiles looks back at Anne
Bill Bill- I am not blind I know what
you’re going through I too was young
once Do exactly as you must

DYER
Im very sorry sir

LAKE
Oh no no- please no apologies But-
before you leave a crate arrived this

Lake glances over at Danforth who grins in anticipation

DANFORTH
Something you must definitely see

INT NATURAL SCIENCE HALL - NIGHT

Lake leads Danforth and Dyer down a corridor lined with
tall glass cabinets containing bones and pickled specimens
Running the length of the vaulted ceiling is a complete
WHALE SKELETON

LAKE
Did I ever tell you that they named this
wing after my grandfather

DYER
Yes sir I believe you did

LAKE
And that the library was- -

DYER
-named after your father you‘ve
mentioned that too sir Twice

Lake chuckles They climb a flight of stairs

LAKE
Forgive me I tend to dwell on it But-—
-its not easy you see Having these
illustrious dead men weighing on your
shoulders Not easy at all At your
age tine has no meaning Its of no
consequence But-—

Be unlocks the door to an office

He opens the door Dyer’s jaw sags in astonishment

INT LAKE’S OFFICE - SAME

Lake’s office is wall-to-wall books and glass cases In the
center SOMETHING stands unseen by CAMERA

CY

LAKE
The creature was heavily decomposed when
fossilization began but the striations
on both flanks clearly suggest the
existence of other appendages you see

DYER
Sir I- Ive never seen anything like it-—

DANFORTH
No one has actually

As Dyers approaches the display comes into view a massive -
if fragmentary - FOSSIL of a monstrous CREATURE

Outside the party is in full swing Lake glances through
the window into the garden Anne is directly below waiting

» PANFORTH (CONT’D
(looks at Dyer)
Want to venture a date

DYER
I- there are faint traces of a layered
stromatolite that would suggest-

DANFORTH
Precambrian late Archaean

DYER
Impossible- nothing remotely as complex
as this creature existed on earth It
must be a fake-

LAKE
Oh it‘s real That much Im sure of
You may recall the Randolph expedition-

DYER
Yes six six months ago uncharted
stretch of land west of Mt Lister

LAKE
Precisely

DYER
Not much came of it as I recall

DANFORTH
(wry smile
Thats what was said wasnt it

LAKE
In fact Professor Randolph was -
intimidated by this find I am not

Outside Anne leaves

He stirs a cup of tea but the spoon tumbles from his hand
As he picks it up he netices snow on the floor

Removing one of the floorboards he finds that the par Lor
rests on ice Dyer stares the shadows in the adjacent room

Shut up and eat some salt or you’li get
some from here
(he cocks both barrels
You’re all too smart for me-

They watch warily as Atwood and Danforth each take a fistful
of salt and gulp it down They cough and retch But nothing
more

INT ABANDONED CITY DAY

Lake and his companions work their way down a gargantiran set
of steps like toddlers inching their way to a massive room
downstairs

INT BIOLOGY ROOM

At the bottom they find themseives in a round chamber
Pierced by blasted-out holes as if it had been invadedd by
gigantic moles

The men peek into an endless tunnel All quiet They move
on

Mammoth sculptures of unknown Gods have toppled like otatsize
trees The walls are tiled with bumpy translucent shapes
emitting a soft green glow

- LAKE
Bioluminescence-

He presses his hand against a panel As he pulls away a
lingering silhouette of his hand throbs and fades

LAKE (CONTD)
-reacting to the heat of our bodies
B4

As they reach the center of the space they find a web of
stalactites and stalagmites reaching down from a broken dome
high overhead Tangled within it a petrified fusion of
BONES at least eighty feet high one hundred feet wide at
the base

GORDON
Are those bones

Awed the men come closer

ROPES
There- a Pteranodon skull- almost
complete-

Gordon points at an enormous club-like femur

GORDON
-Allosaurus-

The men spread out marvelling at mollusks crustaceans
skeletal birds and mammals

ROPES
Iquancdon-

Ropes brings out a manual drill and samples the mound A
large SHARP CHISEL finishes the job

GORDON
Petrified fused together by mineral
drips-

(beat)

It would take hundreds of millions of
years to create a formation of this size-

Pabodie illuminates a mastodon skull

PABODIE
But there are higher mammals here

Lakes flashlight beam illuminates a complex mural
spiralling its way up a column

LAKE
All life on earth actually

GORDON
What are you saying

Lake scrutinizes PICTOGRAMS of familiar animals on earth
Beneath each one theres a schematic of muscles bones
hervous systems

LAKE
Classified here- insects mammals
reptiles birds-

He brings out the Necronomicon and deciphers-

LAKE (CONT‘D)
These beings- on the first day- created
the birds On the second day they
created the fish and the animals that
inhabit the sea-

Ropes and Gordon look at the skeletal remains with growing
amazement

ROPES
No Stop Where are you going with this

LAKE
Where do you think

GORDON
(seeing something)
Dear God in heaven-

There fused with other creatures of the mound a human
skeleton is perfectly visible Lake is serene

LAKE
Yes I knew it Humbling is it not

The grinning skull trembles A VIBRATION-

Light hits their faces It emanates from one of the doorways
across the hall

GORDON
You feel that Heat

They can hear distant noises Gordon and Ropes pull shotguns
from their backpacks

INT MACHINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

They enter an even larger chamber as big as Romes
colosseum Everywhere water is dripping And great machines
are humming Massive platforms swing around and lock into
place

Copper spheres float overhead silently orbiting like
burnished planets

This area too has been tunneled The men are sweating
They throw off their backpacks open their parkas

ROPES
Jesus its like an oven in here-

GORDON
Look-

He points at one of the machines its broken gutted out

Organic-looking ducts spill onto thefloor Diffuse arcs of
electricity radiate from it forming a field of energy

Debris hovers around it suspended in mid-air as if fixed
in a still photograph

Fascinated Ropes takes a step forward inserting his hand
into the crackling energy He grimaces in pain His hand
shrivels before his eyes

Before he can speak he’s sucked inward his body drying up
as if vacuumed from within-

Gordon heads to the rescue but Lake stops him

LAKE
No-

The clothing - now rags - falls away from Ropes” body The
mummified husk shrinks into an unrecognizable blob in mid-
air

The men stand in shock disbelieving Lake pulls out his
watch and moves towards the distortion

GORDON
Stay away from there-

The watch hands accelerate as Lake gets close Then he
throws it at the machine It arcs then stops in mid-air

LAKE
There The distortions They emanate from
here If -we find a way to shut this down-

Lake leans against an organic console filled with knobs and
protrusions A HUMM as they unfold a metallic clamp
trapping his hand

One of the spheres descends spins and pops open above
Lakes head as if generating power Lake panics

LAKE (CONT‘D
For the love of God Gordon help mett

The sphere projects a beam of blinding light down onto
Lake’s head His arms and body become translucent

He screams

DISSOLVE TO

VISION
Images come in rapid succession

The Old Ones creating life in a strange room using glassy
receptacles charged with electricity and liquids Alien
alchemy at work

t Bones and muscles weave and intertwine in each receptacle
forming fish fowl mammals

Then a faint other-worldly CLAMOR reaches Lake’s ears a
chorus of ten thousand VOICES

« He finds himself gazing over the alien city in its moment
of glory Gleaming spires ziggurats temples Even the
mountains look new and majestic The lower slopes are
coveredin green jungle

The skies are alive with soaring star-headed creatures -
gliding in majestic formation peeling out from behind
radiant golden clouds Down down

--inteo a MAELSTROM OF WAR

The broad smoke-filled causeways of the city are covered
with surging agglutinations of slime which fling up long
tentacles to ensnare the winged aliens and pull them in

--and wrap hungry orifices over their wriggling helpless
bodies

The Shoggoths decapitate the Old Ones

« Underwater the stone “coffins” splash down away from the
reach of the Shoggoths As they bob gently in the water
CAMERA COMES UP The distant mountains are in flames

t On the horizon amidst columns of smoke a massive THING
as tall as the mountains seems to undulate

As it rises

FLASHBACK ENDS

The ray beam stops and the sphere retracts as silently as it
descended The contraption that held Lake’s hand folds back
into the console

Lake staggers blinking and disoriented His arms and torso
are still translucent

Pabodie and Boudreau grab Lake as he collapses As Gordon
runs over

LAKE
We- we have to warn the others The
ship They must leave- without us-

GORDON
Calm down You’re all right -

LAKE
No The ones we found Underwater- they
were heroes warriors- injured but
alive The Old Ones were keeping them
safe

GORDON
Safe from what
(glancing at Pabodie)
I’m sorry Dr Lake but-

Lake seizes Gordon by the collar

LAKE

Will You Hear Me The Shoggoths- they
needed those bodies for a summoning- to
pring forth-

(beat
-something much worse than them They
needed the bodies To awaken their God

a groan)

And we we helped them

PABODIE
Shoggoths Summoning What on earth-
(beat)
I say we go back to the surface and wait —
yes wait - for Moulton to get b-
BAMMMMM A massive Shoggoth explodes out from of one of
the tunnels iit It grabs and devours Pabodie in mid-—

sentence

Gordon drags Lake away Boudreau follows They run into a-

GALLERY

From other tunnels Shoggoths spring out emitting shrill
piping sounds displaying pink beaks lined with rows of
teeth

They snatch up Gordon then Boudreau

Lake rounds a corner

CATACOMBS

He reaches a room resembling a burial vault lined with
crypts containing ancient skeletons Hearing a sound Lake
lies down in a niche and keeps still

A Sheggoth enters the vault sniffing Then it withdraws

Lakeexhales and looks up He discovers a hole right above
him A RUMBLE Something plunges down on him

WHAPP Hes taken For a few terrifying moments CAMERA
FOLLOWS upward as his body is devoured and assimilated

Then the Shoggoth gains speed and disappears in the
darkness

Under a star-filled velvet sky a dozen oversize albino
penguins face the glowing mountains The birds are rigid and
silent as if in anticipation

EXT ICE FIELD PANORAMA - SAME

Larsen and Dyer are on a hilltop Danforth and Atwood stand
behind them The Arkham is a mile below cloaked in mist
Through binoculars FLAMES are visible at the ship‘s
waterline

Spideryhumanoid aberrations crawl over the ships hull
Busy as a beehive

DYER
Theyre burning diesel fuel I think
they’re freeing the ship-

DANFORTH
Once at sea these beings will spread-
infect the world

ATWOOD
At best we’re all mad inhabiting a
nightmare At worst well see them
reclaim the planet

DANFORTH
What if we keep them where they are -
surrounded by seawater- Were on an
isthmus Inherently unstable -

Danforth points to the dark jagged fault line running
through the ice

DANFORTH (CONTD)
And thats an ice fracture

In the cavernous forward hold the men pry open a wooden
crate exposing a fresh supply of dynamite Larsen handles
one of the sticks It crumbles to dust

LARSEN
Shit Its like its been here for ages

They sort through the boxes A third of the sticks are still
intact

emerges from it and regards the open door
MISKATONIC”S CHAPEL SAME

Atwood enters the ship‘s chapel and puts down his shotgun
Below the large wooden cross he guietly crosses himself
Behind the altar he breaks through a sheet of ice and opens

drawers and cabinets

At last he finds what he’s looking for a BIBLE

As he turns to leave he sees something briefly reflected in
the cracked glass of the cabinet He spins around to witness
a glistening shape resolve into the form of a man standing

in the doorway
It’s LAKE He gazes balefully at Atwood

ATWOOD
Lake- how did you-

The Lake-thing laughs a wet horrible noise

LAKE
Not Lake

ATWOOD

Th- the Lord is my shepherd I sh- shall
hot want He maketh me to lie down in -

in green pastures

LAKE
At-wocd-

He utters the name as if it were an unfamiliar memory

LAKE (CONTD)

Lake is here With us He wants you to
know that it was them - The Old Ones who
brought life to this planet not your

God
The Lake-thing shimmers and glides up to Atwood

ATWOOD

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever

LAKE
They created life many times on many
worlds First out of hunger Then out
of boredom they created men Yes They
made you a house pet

(MORE)

LAKE (CONTD)

And gave you doubts and fears and hopes

and faith It made you more entertaining
to watch- like a puppy chasing its tail

Tentacles envelop Atwood in a smothering embrace

LAKE (CONT’D)
Go on little man Finish your prayer
you know that no one is listening

Atwood struggles The Lake-thing wraps a tentacle arownd the
man‘s neck and pulls him close Lake’s face slowly

painfully re-shapes itself into that of Atwood The
suffocating man is now staring at himself

ATWOOD
In your merciful hands -

Overcome Atwood can’t go on He extends his hand and grabs
the shotgun

A surge of wet rubbery tentacles invade Atwood’s neck His
face becomes bestial with a huge grinning mouth and sharp
teeth It lunges

OUTSIDE ON THE ICE LATER

Outside the Miskatonic the men lash three crates of
dynamite onto a dogsled From inside the boat the soumd of
a SHOT

LARSEN
Atwood

(beat)
Wheres Atwood

ATWOOD
I- Im sorry- the shotgun- I heard
something and- it went off-

The men look up at the highest of the Miskatonic’s rusty
decks They see Atwood standing woodenly at the rail

ATWOOD (CONT’D)
I- Im sorry- I found what I was looking
for-

He lifts the Bible Danforth and Dyer exchange a look
Atwood seems distant ready to die

LARSEN
Well get down here now We have no
time to waste-

Atwood stand there watching them work Finally he starts
down

gave us something to hold onto

INT MILITARY HOSPITAL DAY
“END FLASHBACK Back to 1939

In the greenhouse of the MILITARY HOSPITAL Starkweather
sits opposite old haunted Dyer who is in handcuffs

DYER
Something to act on-

Tears run down his wizened cheeks

STARKWEATHER
Yes goon its all right Dyer Im
here

But Dyer is looking at the CONSUL who comes in from the
lush gardens outside

CONSUL
Captain Weve had word from London
Warsaw has fallen

As Starkweather opens his orders the Consul glances at
Dyer

CONSUL (CONTD)
(whispers in his ear)
They say this Arkham inquiry it’s not
worth any more of your time They want
you to sail Tonight to-

STARKWEATHER
(whispers back)
Shh I understand Say no more please
Not now

The Consul moves away
STARKWEATHER (CONT’D)

Please Tell me what happened to
Danforth to Larsen

Dyer nods Looks at Starkweather readying to finish the
tale

cur TO

EXT CREVASSE NIGHT

Roped together Larsen and Atwood are deep in the crevasse
setting charges of dynamite and stringing lengths of fuse
wire Shreds of FOG blow past them

Dyer and Danforth work on another section closer to the
surface Hearing CHANTING Dyer cautiously raises his head

DYER
(whispers to Danforth)
Keep working

Staying low he grabs a shotgun and moves off toward the
bonfires around the ship

CLOSER

The scorched tents billow in the night wind the empty stone
monoliths and their lids are scattered about

Dyer hides and spies on the remnants of the men from tlhe
Arkham now fused into grotesque multi-limbed crawling
things Their arachnoid arms have speared the still-
twitching bodies of the exhumed Old Ones

They intone a guttural phrase “Phnglui mglwnafh Cthulhu
Rlyeh wgahnagl fhtagn”

DYER
Oh dear God-

A crude welter of symbols and stones is arranged in a RITUAL
CIRCLE Impaled on stakes lifeless alien heads drip blood

Dyer sees the monstrous beings genuflect towards the
mountains in expectation He follows their gaze

---as beams of greenish aurora australis reach up from
behind the peaks Clouds boil up as in a gathering stoxm

DYER (CONT’D)
What the hell-

He scurries away

AT THE CREVASSE
Dyer comes running and finds Danforth climbing out
DYER

Touch it off now Now do you

Now
hear

DANFORTH
But Larsen and Atwood-

DYER
It doesn’t matter- set it off- you
hear Don’t wait-

Danforth frantically wires up the detonator hands shaking
Dyer darts along the crevasse following the fuse wire

DYER (CONTD)
Larsen Atwood

INSIDE THE FISSURE

Larsen hears the shouts as he places the last of the
dynamite

- LARSEN
Ready Lets get-

When he turns he sees Atwood ripping down the wires
Larsen chuckles

LARSEN (CONTD)
You- whatever the fuck you are-
(beat)
You’re good You got me

Atwood turns and starts to transform

LARSEN (CONTD)
But-
(beat)
-you really dont know shit about
explosives do you

The Atwood-thing lunges but Larsen grabs his shotguns and
points them not at the creature but at the dynamite

BAMMMMMi

ICE FIELD CONTINUOUS

A blinding series of EXPLOSIONS rockets along the ice
fissure lighting up the night

A mighty SOUND wells up from below Danforth and Dyer are
thrown backward as the world heaves and bucks

Gargantuan shards of ice lift from the sea then slide away
The entire isthmus is breaking apart

AT THE ARKHAM

The creatures turn reacting to the explosions Like
spiders they leap toward the crevasse

RUNNING

The two men head for the ship Sheets of seawater wash over
their boots as the ice floe tilts under their feet

DYER
Theyre off the ship Keep running

Behind them the creatures howl as the saltwater overruns
their extremities burning away hunks of flesh

In the middle of it all the Arkham surrounded by smoke
rolls slowly toward her port side

A huge insect-like thing lands ahead of Danforth swatting
at him He ducks and manages to shoot The thing goes down
dragging its wounded membranes

A pack of six-legged snarling dog-things is expelled from
the boiling flesh their backs alive with tendrils Damforth
shoots again - CLICK he’s out of shells The dogs leap

Suddenly Danforth’s legs go out from under him and he skids
into the widening gap

IN THE GAP

Danforth grabs a hand hold dangling over oblivion Hunks of
ice slide past The dog-things tumble past him into darkness
but transform rapidly enough te grip the ice wall and climb
Their heads fuse and form a massive maw open and hungry

Danforth slides towards it From out of nowhere Dyer’s
hand reaches down seizing Danforth

DYER
My turn pal-

He shoots at the climbing creature and pulls Danforth up
For a moment the two friends look at each other
remembering

DANFORTH
The ship- it’s free

The Arkham is drifting away heeled over from the still open
gash in her side

THE ARKHAM
Danforth and Dyer grab onto a trailing hawser

Two creatures leap after them sprouting spidery legs
seizing the same line

Climbing for all hes worth Dyer loses his shotgun
Danforth fires blasting the first monster sending it
bubbling and boiling into the sea

But the second Shoggoth is gaining on them sprouting more
limbs

They reach the deck The creature keeps climbing right
behind them

Danforth points the gun CLICK Out of shelis He
starts reloading

In a tool cabinet next to one of the massive drills Dyer
finds a FIRE AX He hacks at the hawser

The Shoggoth throws out three tentacles which grab the rail
Dyer slices through them then chops the rope The
Shoggoth tumbles to its watery death

IN THE WATER

It disintegrates squealing and squirming

EXT ARKHAM DECK - SAME

The freshly severed tentacles roll and grow exponentially
ballooning ten-fold Glowing stalks burgeon from the
fingers shining with new life

Then A ROARING sound fills the air

DANFORTH
Bill- Oh Jesus Bill were in hell-

Danforth and Dyer look back as

- up from behind the mountain range comes a heaving TITAN
CTHULHU

It towers in the darkness shifting and swaying Its
membranous wings extend filling the horizon its abom-inable
head silhouetted by lightning in the clouds

Danforth and Dyer flee into the ships bowels The growing
Shoggoths pour down a deck grate in pursuit

INT THE SHIP NIGHT

Danforth and Dyer run through a corridor The floors are
dark with blood The Shoggoth flesh foams in through the
ventilation grills snatching at Dyer who swings his ax-

Danforth fires wildly at anything that moves

They enter a-

FLOODED HOLD

-and jump waist-deep into the salt water They wade
frantically into a storage room

The shrieking Shoggoth makes contact with the water and
steams and bubbles A growing RUMBLE

EXT THE ARKHAM — NIGHT

The writhing Cthulhu looms over the ship black against the
starry sky The creature squeezes the vessel bending steel

plates popping rivets

It plucks the Arkham from the water

and cracks it like a boiled egg Dozens of fleshy Organs
explode into the mess hall the cabins the bridge

DYER AND DANFORTH

-hold for dear life as the STORAGE ROOM TURNS OVER -360
degrees

EXT THE ARKHAM CONTINUOUS

Slow motion the Arkham tumbles slowly through the air
thrown by the THING The ship comes down with a huge splash
INT VARIOUS VIEWSCORRIDORS OF THE SHIP

Water rushes in through every opening in the ship-

-flooding the engine room-

-the mess hall-

-the lab-

-in each instance destreying Shoggoths Washing them away
in hissing steaming chaos

INT STOREROOM

Dyer hits the floor hard Icy water rushes in

Staggering to his feet Dyer pushes the steel door shut
LOCKS IT

Danforth lurches to a porthole and beholds a mind-snapp ing
image

EXT SHORELINE - CONTINUOUS

The CTHULHU impossibly big Its black sparkling body
throbbing with energy

Then Danforth sees something else

DANFORTH
Oh no-no-

Dyer turns to him Danforth is pale and will not speak-

DYER
What- what is it

In shock Danforth slams a shutter over the porthole Locks
it He puts down his shotgun and sinks down onto a bench

DANFORTH
No no- please-

DYER
Tell me what you saw-

LAKE’S VOICE
He saw- the future-

A Shoggoth resolves into the form of Professor Lake amd
steps from the shadows

Dyer FREEZES

pretoplasm engulfing his arm

It’s only a matter of time And we have
all the time in the world

Noe

A SWISH of the ax as Dyer slices the Shoggoth flesh in two
freeing Danforth BAMM Danforth fires

Lake screeches and screams falling backwards and
decomposing into a mass of ooze

DANFORTH
Oh oh God

Lakes Shoggoth tissue wriggles up Danforth’s sleeve

He flings off his jacket rips open his shirt and exposes
his bicep which has been invaded by the opalescent jelly-—

DANFORTH (CONT’D)
Dyer Shoot met Shoot me Now

Danforth’s arm starts to bubble and mutate

DYER
I cant I-
DANFORTH

Bill please I beg you-

(beat)
Do it Bill- I can feel it taking over
please

(beat)

Let me choose- how I die
Grimacing Dyer points the gun and shoots Danforth drops
to his knees covered in blood He stares glassy-eyed at
Dyer

DYER
I- Im so sorry- I am so sorry

Danforth dies in Dyer’s arms Dyer cries embracing the
corpse

Suddenly- from outside in the ship’s CORRIDOR-

Dyer hears VOICES He scrambles backward holding Danforth’s
body He curls up trembling in the water

He waits heart pounding

Wet shuffling noises move closer and closer Horrible
WHISPERS

Then- the doorknob slowly turns

Then it RATTLES A moment later an awful BANG as something
pounds on the door hard It bursts open a figure is
silhouetted speaking incomprehensibly With a SCREAM Dyer
leaps up

End flashback

terrified Australians

And Dyer is impossibly old the boat around him is a rusted
waterlogged ruin

of his captors the Australian officer leans down from
above aiming a PISTOL
