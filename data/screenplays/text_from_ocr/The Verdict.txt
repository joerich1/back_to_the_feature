refused Five days before the trial
What does this mean I want to find

Dr Thompson From your review of
the hospital records of May twelfth
nineteen seventy-six

GALVIN
In your opinion what happened to
Deborah Ann Kaye

DR THOMPSON
to

Cardiac arrest During delivery her
heart stopped When the heart stops
the brains deprived of oxygen You
get brain damage That is why shes
in the state shes in today

GALVIN
Now Dr Towlers testified that
they restored the heartbeat within
three or four minutes In your opinion
is his estimate correct

DR THOMPSON
Its my opinion it took him much
longer Nine ten minutes Theres
too much brain damage

The Judge leans over

JUDGE
(to Dr Thompson)
Are you saying that a failure to
restore the heartbeat within nine
minutes in itself constitutes bad
medical practice

DR THOMPSON
Well

Yes Mr Galvin

GALVIN
If I may be permitted to question my
own witness in my own way

JUDGE
Id just like to get to the point
Mr Galvin Lets not waste these
peoples time Answer the question
Mr Witness Please Would a nine
minute lapse in restoring the
heartbeat in and of itself be
negligence
DR THOMPSON

have I would have to say no

negligence based on my question

question thats correct

Mr Concannon

cuts Billy short meaning Yes I

CONCANNON
Thank you your Honor We object to
the copy of the admissions form as
incompetent and essentially hearsay
evidence and cite McGee versus State
of Indiana US 131 point 2 and 216
through 25 of the Uniform Code The
admission of a duplicate document in
preference to an existing original
must presuppose the possibility of
alteration and so must be disallowed
And your Honor having given the
Plaintiff the leeway we would like
your ruling on this issue now we
object to the admission of the Xerox
form

JUDGE
-one moment Mr Concannon

nods meaning I am considering

JUDGE

The document is disallowed the jury
will be advised not to consider the
testimony of Kathy Costello regarding
the Xerox form

(explains to them)
Its unsubstantiated and we cant
accept a copy in preference to the
original

The Judge He is making some notations on a page in

only evidentiary rebuttal was the
admitting form which has been
disallowed I request that her entire
testimony be disallowed and the jury
advised that they must totally
disregard her appearance here

You know so much of the time were
lost We say Please God tell us
what is right Tell us whats true
There is no justice The rich win
the poor are powerless We become
tired of hearing people lie After a
time we become dead A little dead
We start thinking of ourselves as

victims

(pause)
And we become victims

(pause)
And we become weak and doubt
ourselves and doubt our
institutions and doubt our
beliefs we say for example The
law is a sham there is no law

I was a fool for having believed
there was

(beat)
But today you are the law You are
the law And not some book and not
the lawyers or the marble statues
and the trappings of the court
all that they are is symbols
