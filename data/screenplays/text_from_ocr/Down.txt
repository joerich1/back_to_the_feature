minutes of OT

Kevin and Kelsie look into each other’s eyes

KEVIN
Actually I have something I want
to say
He takes her hands
KEVIN

I know I may not be anywhere near
the perfect husband I’m sure your
parents imagined you marrying some
Wall Street exec Not some
unemployed filmmaker--

A
She shakes her head “no”

KEVIN
Plus I leave the toilet seat up I
know that really pisses you off

She smiles

KEVIN
I’m sure there’s a hundred things
I’m not perfect at But being your
husband taking care of you and
loving you I know I can be perfect
at that I’d never do anything to
hurt you and I promise to make
sure you’re happy and always
smiling just like you are right
now

In the background the NOISE OF THE ELEVATOR as it slows to a
stop

They grab their carry-on bags wait for the doors to open
Only this time-- They don’t

KELSIE
Okay What’s going on

KEVIN
They’re not opening

Kevin jabs at the buttons

KELSIE
Why not

LIAM speaks up with an Irish accent

LIAM
Press the “Door Open” button

KEVIN
I am

LIAM
Wait a second there It’1ll work

They give it ten seconds

KELSIE
It’s not working

LIAM
Try the other one “Door Close”

KEVIN
I’m pressing both I’m pressing
lobby Nothing’s lighting up

Liam walks over starts jabbing at the buttons Then tries
holding them down

LIAM
Must be stuck

KEVIN
That actually happens

LIAM
Aye More often than you think

Kelsie takes a deep breath reaches out and grabs Kevins
arm The onset of a panic attack

KEVIN
We’1ll be out in a second

KELSIE
You know how I get

KEVIN
Remember our old building The
elevators used to stop running all
the time It’s nothing to worry
about

LIAM
It’s true I’ve worked on hundreds
of buildings It’s completely safe
Nothing to fret

KEVIN
See We got an expert on board

KELSIE
They know we’re here

LIAM
Up there
He points to a SECURITY CAMERA disguised in the corner
room

LIAM
That’s a camera

KEVIN
Maybe you should sit babe

KELSIE
I don’t want to sit Kev Press the
emergency button

He looks at Liam

KEVIN
Should I

LIAM
Aye That’s what it’s there for

Kevin presses the button Nothing happens

KEVIN
Now what

Liam flicks at the emergency switch

LIAM
We should hear an alarm

KEVIN
What alarm

LIAM
It’s not working either

KELSIE
Are you serious

Kevin presses the “Call for Help” button
We hear it RING
and RING

LIAM
Nothing This hour Security goes
home when the building closes
Maybe one night guard Who knows if
he’s checking feeds Could be on a
smoke break or something--

of the

KEVIN
Shouldn’t there be an answering
machine I mean people are calling
in with emergencies right

LIAM
You’d think so

Kelsie’s digging through her suitcase finds her phone

KELSIE
Shit I’m not getting anything Use
yours Kev Call someone

KEVIN
Who

KELSIE
I don’t know Anyone 911

Kevin fishes out his cell phone

KEVIN
I’m not getting a signal either
Are you

Liam pulls out his phone

LIAM
Nothing Tough to get signals in
here Boxed in by all this concrete
and steel

KELSIE
So what do we do

Kevin presses the emergency button again
It just RINGS

LIAM
Nothing we can do but wait
Hopefully she’1ll pick up again and
start moving Or whoever’s checking
cameras will spot us eventually
Don’t worry though It won’t be
long They’1ll come and get us out
of here

CUT TO

COMPILED SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE

THE POV FROM THE SECURITY CAMERA INSIDE THE ELEVATOR WE FAST-—
FORWARD THROUGH ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES OF SOUNDLESS TAPE THE
TIME STAMP SPEEDS FORWARD SHOWING US THE PROGRESSION

It shows them pacing around They start banging on the doors
They continue to try the emergency phone without any answer
Kelsie sits down in the corner of the elevator

Kevin sheds his suit jacket piles their bags in the corner
Liam waves his arms at the camera

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR - (707 PM) - (32 MINUTES TRAPPED)

Kelsie and Kevin pound on the doors search for any sign of
life beyond the steel walls

KELSIE
Hello We’re stuck inside

Liam whistles loudly
KELSIE

Where are they It’s been over an
hour already

LIAM
Actually only about thirty
minutes

KELSIE

It feels so much longer

Kevin flips on his HAND-HELD CAMERA stares right at us
Kelsie over his shoulder

She looks impatient

KELSIE
What are you doing

KEVIN
I’m gonna record this

KELSIE
Come on Kev Please don’t treat
this like one of your movies

KEVIN
You didn’t see that video on You
Tube Some kid got stuck in an
elevator for 41 hours He sued for
big money This is the best proof
we have if we’re gonna do the same

LIAM
How much money

KEVIN
I don’t know A lot

LIAM
Ill help you

KEVIN
Nice Here

He hands over the camera

KEVIN
All you have to do is press the red
button It focuses automatically

The camera focuses in on Kevin

LIAM (0S)
You’re on

KEVIN
Hi my name’s Kevin Pritchett I’m
with my fiancee--

He corrects himself

KEVIN
My wife Kelsie Jones And another
gentleman You should say your name
for the record

LIAM (0S)
Collins Liam Collins

KEVIN
We were getting our marriage
license on the twenty-fourth floor
of the Manhattan Municipal
Building Liam you should probably
say what you were doing here

LIAM (0S)
I was filing papers with the
Department of Buildings
KEVIN
Weve been stuck in one of the
elevators here for over half an
hour We should be hearing an
emergency alarm but we’re not None
of the buttons are lighting up
There’s also no response from the
emergency phone We’ve been calling
every minute What you’re seeing
here is clearly gross negligence on
behalf of the building and we’re
documenting this as proof

Kevin takes the camera back turns it off

KELSIE
(sarcastic)
Great Let’s edit this horrible
experience into our marriage video

KEVIN
I think we should It’d be funny

KELSIE
It won’t be funny if we miss our
flight

KEVIN
We have five hours We’1ll be fine

LIAM
You say you just got married I
believe congrats are in order then
It’s a big step I remember my
wedding How could I forget

KEVIN
Thanks We’re actually supposed to
leave for our honeymoon tonight

LIAM
Really Where abouts

KEVIN
Tahiti

LIAM
Ah I hear it’s nice First time
out of the States

KEVIN
No We did a trip around England
Scotland and Ireland

LIAM
That’s my home Ireland As if you
couldn’t tell

Kelsie slides down to the floor takes off her heels

KELSIE
I hate elevators

KEVIN
Remember Disneyland

KELSIE
What That stupid ride The
elevator dropped 13 floors You
didn’t even tell me

LIAM
It’s impossible really Elevators
get a bum rap they do They’re
completely safe

KELSIE
Sorry if I don’t believe you

LIAM
Aye it’s true Only two times did
an elevator actually drop to the
ground in this city Those are damn
fine odds if you figure there are
some fifty-thousand elevators here

KEVIN
When were they The two times

KELSIE
Kev who cares

KEVIN
What I’m curious

LIAM
First was right after World War II
A pilot lost control of his bomber
in the thick fog crashed it into
the side of the Empire State
Building Severed the hoist and
safety cables of two elevators One
of them fell 75 stories with a
woman on board Imagine that

He makes a whistling sound to imitate the falling elevator
A silence

KEVIN
Did she survive

LIAM
Aye Busted up but alive The only
other time I know of was-- 911

KEVIN
Right

LIAM
Estimate around 200 people lost
their lives that day in elevators

KELSIE
This really isn’t making me feel
any safer

KEVIN
He’s saying it’s impossible for an
elevator to fall babe

LIAM
When planes aren’t involved

Liam points up

LIAM
There are eight steel cables above
our heads holding us in place
Practically impossible for them to
snap

KELSIE
(sotto)
Anythings possible

LIAM
Even if they did there’s a device
that detects if an elevator’s
dropping at a rate faster than
normal It trips the safeties
Emergency breaks engage You walk
away in one piece

KEVIN
Youre supposed to jump before you
hit the ground

LIAM
Bollocks You should lie flat

KEVIN
When “Elevators” show up as a
category on Jeopardy you must
really kick ass

Liam laughs

LIAM
Suppose youre right Technologys
my passion Especially buildings

He gets serious

LIAM
Still elevators should be
respected They can be
unpredictable and dangerous if you
don’t have your wits about you
Doors sometimes open where they
shouldn’t or close on people as
they try and run through Crushing
your arm your leg or even your
head Or sometimes they stop for no
reason Like us They’d find the
trapped passengers weeks later
dead on our backs like cockroaches--

KELSIE
I’m sorry to interrupt but can we
please stop talking about elevators
and death and all that fun stuff

KEVIN
You’re right Sorry

The guys look down minds still racing

KEVIN
Jesus you think it could have been
a terrorist attack or something I
mean how would we know right

KELSIE
Kev

KEVIN
Probably just a power outage

LIAM
Nah You want my guess Mechanical
most likely

Kelsie gets up starts pulling on the doors

KEVIN
What are you doing

KELSIE
Trying to open them

One of the doors starts to slide back

KELSIE
You guys try

Kevin and Liam take the doors pull them back to reveal a
white concrete wall The number “12” written in red paint

Kevin touches the cold concrete

LIAM
Twelfth floor We’re stuck between
them

Kevin leans out the door peers through the cracks between
the wall and the sill of the elevator

There’s nothing visible above them Below only a deep dark
abyss

KEVIN
I can’t see anything but a few
lights down at the bottom I can
feel a breeze

LIAM
It’s en express elevator Skips the
bottom floors What they call a
blind hoistway

KELSIE
What about a ceiling compartment
They always have them

KEVIN
Like in Die Hard

Kevin hands the camera to Kelsie

KEVIN
Get this on tape

KELSIE
I don’t care about filming
KEVIN
We’ll be glad we have the footage
later if we need to take legal
action I Promise

HAND-HELD CAMERA cuts in
Liam hops up on the hand-rail

LIAM
It’s there alright but--

He pulls hard at the ceiling panels his muscles flexing

Nothing budges

LIAM
It’s locked As I thought

KELSIE (0S)
Isn’t that a safety violation

LIAM
On the contrary That’s why they
lock it To keep us from horsing
about up there It’s only for
emergency workers to get in

KELSIE (0S)
That’s it then We’re trapped ina
floating coffin a hundred feet
over nothing

LIAM
‘Fraid so

She leans against the wall

KELSIE (0S)
I need air

KEVIN
Concentrate on your breathing

KELSIE
Kev I need air

KEVIN
Youre fine I promise

Kevin takes the camera back turns it off and sits next to

her hugs her to his shoulder Liam smiles at them

The DOORS DING and shut

LIAM
I think she’s working

Liam presses the lobby button They ready themselves for the
descent Nothing happens

LIAM
Come on Bloody thing

KELSIE
This is ridiculous

KEVIN
What else can we do

LIAM
Take turns making as much noise as
we can There’s a slim chance
someone might hear us Keep on the
buttons Other than that try to
enjoy each other’s company

KELSIE
It’s the end of the day What if
they all went home We could be in
here until Monday or longer I
don’t know shit about elevators
but I know you can’t go three days
without water

KEVIN
It won’t be that long

LIAM
The safest place you can be ina
situation like this is inside the
elevator I promise
CAMERA CUTS OUT
COMPILED SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE
WE FAST-FORWARD THROUGH ANOTHER HOUR OF SOUNDLESS TAPE

They continue to bang on the doors Kelsie uses her heels
anything to make noise

Liam searches for a signal on his phone then sits and messes
around with it

They keep pressing the buttons hoping for a sign of life

Eventually they all end up seated around the elevator

INT ELEVATOR - (823 PM) - (1 HR 48 MINUTES TRAPPED)

Kelsie’s got her eyes closed still trying to control her
breathing

Liam’s down to a tight black T-shirt showing off a muscular
physique

Kevin turns on the HAND-HELD CAMERA addresses it head-on

KEVIN
It’s been almost two hours We
haven’t heard a thing Not one
sound Nothing that would indicate
a rescue attempt is even being
made Liam says there are over
thirty elevators in this building
Well to those that are going to
watch this footage they clearly
forgot about one of them

He turns if off scoots back over to Kelsie She rests her
head on his shoulder He puts his arm around her

KELSIE
Youre positive about the air

LIAM
There’s constant ventilation

KELSIE
I always leave my bathroom door
unlocked I’m scared I’1l get stuck
inside I take taxis whenever I
can you know just to avoid the
subways

She nestles into Kevin’s shoulder

KELSIE
I guess it could be worse We could
be stuck with some awful elevator
music on repeat

LIAM
(singing)
“One-thousand nine-hundred and
ninety-nine bottles of beer on the
wall”

KELSIE
(with a smile)
Don’t even go there

KEVIN
“Row row row your boat Gently
down the stream”

KELSIE
That’s worse

Liam laughs

LIAM
Wait I got one “How much is that
doggie in the window The one with
the waggily tail”

He points at Kevin

KEVIN
“How much is that doggie in the
window” Kelsie

KELSIE
“I do hope that doggie’s for sale”

Liam and Kevin clap for her

LIAM
That was my son’s favorite Every
night I’d play that record Good
Lord It drove me mental

KEVIN
I can imagine

LIAM
I got a plan After we sue we
should take all this camera footage
and make a movie

KEVIN
We can call it “Going Down”

LIAM
Sounds like a porno

KELSIE
Might as well call it “The Shaft”

LIAM
(movie trailer voice)
“Going Down on the Shaft” starring
Candy Lane “One long shaft One
tight little box”

They laugh
LIAM
So you’re eloping That’s exciting
Always wanted to do that Take off
Not tell anyone

KELSIE
They already know about it

LIAM
They’re not upset They don’t get
to partake in the marriage

KEVIN
That’s what the camera’s for

LIAM
Now I get it

KELSIE
I just didn’t want some stuffy
traditional ceremony We first met
while we were traveling It just
seemed right to get the paper-work
over with then go have some new
adventures together

LIAM
I can appreciate that

KEVIN
So where you from exactly I
remember the country pretty well

LIAM
County Cork

KEVIN
That’s where the Blarney Stone is
right

LIAM
Aye Did ya’ kiss ‘er

KEVIN
I did Kelsie was scared of germs

LIAM
That’s bad luck you know

KELSIE
Yeah well-- No offense but Trip
Advisor voted it the most
unhygienic tourist attraction in
the world

LIAM
Knowing the kinds of birds we have
in that country it may be right

KEVIN
What Like pigeons

Liam laughs

LIAM
Pigeons No mate It’s slang for
women

KEVIN
Right Should have known that

LIAM
I travel a lot too

KELSIE
Anywhere cool

LIAM
Ah sure All over Best way I
found is to rent my own car I like
the convertibles Especially if the
weather’s warm In the summer you
know That’s how my son and I saw
California

KEVIN
Nice birds there right

KELSIE
Shut up Kev

LIAM
Better watch yourself

KEVIN
It’s funny cause that’s exactly how
Kelsie and I like to travel
Remember Kelsie What did we rent
in Ireland Shit it was like the

get used to it How you guys drive
on the opposite side of the road

LIAM
(with anger)
What are you talking about

Kevin looks taken aback

KEVIN
What

LIAM
You’re the ones who drive on the
wrong side of the road

He stares at Kevin Angry It’s an awkward moment

KEVIN
What You’re kidding right

Liam laughs

LIAM
Of course We’re the wrong ones
You Americans are always right

Kevin smiles Liam turns his attention to Kelsie

LIAM
What about you hun You have fun
over there

KELSIE
Loved it The Irish are like
probably the nicest people in the
entire world
LIAM
The old Irish hospitality

KEVIN
What I remember most are all the
green hills with those little
white dots all over them

LIAM
Aye The sheep You know what I
remember most

KEVIN

The pubs A few pints of the Black
Stuff

KEVIN

you one
Liam half-smiles
LIAM

Nah you’re just saying that You
wouldn’t really

KEVIN
What are you talking about Of
course I would

LIAM
Nah I appreciate the pleasantries
But let’s be honest You’re the
type of guy who’d say something
like that and never follow through
on it

KEVIN
That’s not true And just because
of that I’m gonna buy you two

Liam laughs
LIAM
Alright I live down in Tribeca
Lots of good bars

KELSIE
That’s were we live

LIAM
You don’t say Fuck me we got a
lot in common You probably live in
a nice place Let me guess parents

Kevin looks at Kelsie

LIAM
You can tell me to mind my own
business
KELSIE
What do I care Yeah my parents

Liam smacks Kevin
LIAM

No shit That’s a good deal for you
there brotha’ No wonder you
married her

KELSIE
That’s what my Dad always says

Kevin shakes it off

KEVIN
It’s not that nice It’s a cramped
overpriced apartment But it’s
close to the bank Kelsie works at

KELSIE
Worst Job Ever

LIAM
What about you What do you do

KEVIN
Well-- I worked in IT for a while
I have an engineering degree but--
I’m between jobs right now

LIAM
Oh my you really lucked out

KEVIN
I couldn’t sit in that office
anymore I knew I was destined for
better things So I’m following my
dream

LIAM
What’s this dream Walk on the
moon

KEVIN
Write and direct my own movies

LIAM
What kind of movies Don’t say rom-
coms I bloody hate rom-coms

HorrorThriller stuff

LIAM
Scary movies Oh I love those

KEVIN
All it takes is one break

LIAM
(to Kelsie)
What do you think about that
Family of money-makers You off
doing you job Husband at home

KEVIN
(taking offense)
Yeah well I told her up front that
I wasn’t giving up my dream anytime
soon So-- She knew what she was
getting into

LIAM
Relax mate Gonna give yourself an
aneurysm She already married ya’

KELSIE
Yep No turning back

LIAM
Little self-conscious aren’t we

Liam smiles at Kelsie She smiles back

LIAM
What about kids They in the cards

KELSIE
Kevin wants them

LIAM
Let me guess You’re not ready

KELSIE
I’m twenty-seven

LIAM
You’re still young

KEVIN
I don’t think so

LIAM
Let the girl live a little Kids
are a big deal

KEVIN
She will by the time she’s thirty

He squeezes her

KELSIE
Don’t squeeze me Kevin

LIAM
Uh-oh Think you’ve made her upset

Kevin looks defeated switches topics

KEVIN
So You lived here a while

LIAM
Aye Most of my life Came over
when I was a little boy Parents
are still back there

KEVIN
I’m actually a quarter Irish

LIAM
We must be related then

An uncomfortable silence Kevin switches topics

KEVIN
(patronizing)
You work on buildings Like what
Like a construction guy

again

Kevin chuckles at this as if construction guys are beneath
him As if this assessment somehow gives him an upper hand

LIAM
Why Do I look like one

KEVIN
I wouldn’t even now what one looked
like

LIAM

Nah I bet you wouldn’t What I do
is design complex tech systems
Kind of like the stuff you probably
did when you had a real job Except
larger projects Security mostly
Let’s say for example you’re an
important guy You own a big
building Inside that building are
all your dirty secrets you’ve
tucked away From other people
Maybe from yourself

KEVIN
Yeah and--

LIAM
I make sure those secrets stay
hidden

KEVIN
Interesting

LIAM
Like your lady says it pays the
bills

Kevin motions to the wedding band on Liam’s finger

KEVIN
What’s your wife do

KELSIE
Kev Mind your own business

Liam shoots Kevin a death stare

LIAM
I’m not married

KEVIN
You got a ring on your finger You
were talking about your wedding I
mean I just assumed--

LIAM
(with anger)
Assumption is the mother of all
fuck-ups No one ever teach you
that-- brotha’

KEVIN
(taken aback)
I’m sorry I didn’t mean anything
by it Just making conversation

Liam smiles

LIAM
I’m just messin’ with ya I’m not
married anymore I was Her name
was Alanna

He motions Kevin to lean in closer so he can whisper

LIAM
(into Kevin’s ear)
Probably the kind of woman you jack-
off to when your old lady’s not
around

KEVIN
Jesus man

Kevin forces an uncomfortable smile

KELSIE
What did he say

KEVIN
Nothing

He motions Kevin to lean in again He does
LIAM
Not that there’s anything wrong
with you know who
Liam eyes Kelsie up and down
LIAM
Bet she’s tight as hell eh I’d

love to find out

KEVIN
Whoa Hey Relax

KELSIE
Whatd he say

LIAM
Were just joking around Guy talk
Right Kev

He smacks Kevin in the arm Kevin fakes a smile turns back
to Liam

KEVIN
There’s no need to take it there
though Seriously

LIAM
Seriously Kevin wants to be
serious
Kelsie smiles
LIAM

Alright let’s be serious Kev I
can take it anywhere I want to and
there’s not a fuckin’ thing you can
do about it How’s that for
serious

Kevin quickly backs off

KEVIN
Look if I offended you I’m sorry

KELSIE
What did you say Kev

Liam stares him down--
Then cracks up claps his hands

LIAM
I’m just fuckin’ with you Shit
man it’s an Irish thing See who
can get each other’s goat I
honestly think your husband may be
the most gullible person I’ve ever
met

Kevin smiles if still deeply disturbed

KEVIN
Yeah You got me

LIAM
My wife was a good woman But
sadly it wasn’t meant to be

He traces his fingers along the steel rivets in the floor

LIAM
There was an accident and although
it wasn’t my fault She blamed me
for it I’m not angry with her It
was the only way she could have
moved on with her life She needed
to just-- leave it all behind

KELSIE
Sorry to hear that

LIAM
Very kind of you Kelsie I
appreciate those condolences I
really do

Kevin gets up
KEVIN
Where the hell is the rescue
already This is crazy Someone’s
gonna pay for this

LIAM
Damn right We’1ll see to it

CUT TO
COMPILED SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE

WE FAST-FORWARD THROUGH ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES OF SOUNDLESS
TAPE

Kelsie stays seated Kevin paces around the elevator bangs
on the door every now and then cups his hands to his mouth
and shouts

He then sits and holds Kelsie strokes her hair

Liam watches them seated in the corner cross-legged Some
dialogue is exchanged Unclear what

CAMERA CUTS IN

INT ELEVATOR - (909 PM) - (2 HR 34 MINUTES TRAPPED)

Kevin’s filming Kelsie via HAND-HELD CAMERA Her head against
the unlit row of buttons Tired Frustrated

KEVIN (0S)
Stuck in an elevator for two hours
And yet her hair still looks great
What’s her secret

A weak smile

KELSIE
We missed our flight
KEVIN
It sucks I know
KELSIE
You know what bothers me the most
though
KEVIN (0S)

That they won’t give us a refund

KELSIE

No one but Steve and Josie know we
left tonight It was a red eye so
you know they won’t think twice if
they don’t hear from us They’11l
just assume we’re on a beach
somewhere or some jungle with
shitty reception

KEVIN (0S)
Yeah I thought of that too

KELSIE
No one knows we’re here

She bangs her head softly against the row of elevator
buttons then reaches up and playfully tries pressing them
clearly missing

KELSIE
Did I hit it

KEVIN (0S)
Come on keep trying them It’s
important

KELSIE
I have been trying For the past
hour No one’s there

Kevin turns off the camera

LIAM
So you’d really buy me a pint after
this

KEVIN

Two pints remember
LIAM
You’re a good guy I can tell

KEVIN
Thanks

LIAM
It’s funny though

KEVIN
What is

LIAM
You know How good guys are
sometimes capable of doing the
worst things

KEVIN
I guess that’s true of anyone

LIAM
Aye That’s true We all have that
instinct We’ve all thought about
what it might be like To hurt
someone who makes you unhappy
Who’s wronged you or your family in
some way

He looks away

LIAM
I’m surprised you know

KEVIN
About what

LIAM
Us being buddies About to go out
and get a few pints

KEVIN
Why’s that surprising

LIAM
Cause you never even bothered to
ask me

Kelsie looks up and Kevin He keeps rubbing her back

KEVIN
I don’t get it

LIAM
I told you there was an accident
That caused my wife to leave me It
left me so dead inside that I
wanted nothing more to make those
responsible feel my pain But you
never asked me what it was

KEVIN
I didn’t think it was any of my
business

LIAM
But we’re mates now Of course it
is

Liam reaches a hand behind his back He returns with his
wallet

He stares down Kevin and takes out a picture of a YOUNG BOY

LIAM
This is my son Patrick

Kelsie sits up takes the picture from Kevin

LIAM
He died in an accident when he was
eight-years-old

Liam takes the photo back

Kelsie ignores them gets up and starts pressing the intercom
buttons again

KEVIN
You alright

KELSIE
I’m sorry I feel like we can’t
just sit around talking the whole
time We have to try and get out of
here Something

Liam watches her An empty expression on his face His eyes
colder than we’ve seen them

LIAM
I share something like that with
you Kelsie and you just get up
Ignore what I have to say
KELSIE
Sorry honestly no disrespect I
just think we should maintain our
focus here

She keeps holding down the intercom buttons

LIAM
Kelsie come back over so we can
finish our talk What you’re doing
is rude Not to mention I can
honestly tell you Pressing those
buttons isn’t gonna work

Kevin stares at him
LIAM
No one’s coming to rescue us They
can’t see us They can’t hear us
No one knows we’re here

KEVIN
What are you talking about

LIAM
The elevator’s not going anywhere

He smiles at them both

LIAM
Because I’m the one who stopped it

Kelsie looks back at him terrified
KEVIN

(with a laugh)
What are you talking about

LIAM
You should see the look on your
faces

KELSIE

Are you kidding

LIAM
Not this time When you work in my
field you make a lot of friends A
lot of people owe you favors Some
may get you tickets to a game Some
may take you to lunch

Liam looks up smiles to himself
LIAM
Others might allow you to traverse
their elevator shafts to plant
radio transponders inside the cars
Or maybe turn their backs as you
tinker with their building’s
technical infrastructure to reroute
camera feeds and emergency call
lines I have a lot of friends
They owe me a lot of favors

Liam reaches into his pocket He takes out an iPhone

LIAM
It’s amazing in this day and age
How you can change the world with
the push of a button

He taps his phone and the elevator starts to move
Another tap and it stops

KEVIN
Youre doing this

KELSIE
You gotta’ be kidding me Are you
out of your fuckin’ mind

LIAM
Kelsie do me a favor and shut
that dirty mouth of yours

KEVIN
Kelsie come here

Kevin pulls her back

KEVIN
That’s impossible How’d you know
we were gonna be here

LIAM
Because I’ve been following you
For a while now I know everything
about you The types of expensive
clothes Kelsie buys The useless
movie web sites you spend hours on
while she’s at work I know your
credit card numbers your flight
numbers Your parents’ names Bob
and Margaret

Kevin pulls Kelsie closer Liam fishes out a gold key tosses

it to them It CLANGS on the steel floor
Kelsie picks it up

KEVIN
Our apartment

LIAM
I even know that Kevin leaves the
toilet seat up

KELSIE
Jesus Christ

LIAM
You know you two were an hour late
today Almost screwed everything

up

KEVIN
Why are you doing this

LIAM
I thought about what I’d say when I
was finally alone with you two
I’ve waited two years for this
moment

He reaches down his leg unsheathes a vicious looking knife

Kelsie SCREAMS grabs Kevin

KEVIN
What are you doing

LIAM
I dreamt about it When we’d come
face to face What I would say to
you both What I would do

KEVIN
You don’t have to do this Just
tell me what you want What do you
want And I can make it happen I
promise

KELSIE
Is this about money I can get you
money How much do you want

LIAM
Kelsie Kelsie Kelsie Always
trying to buy her problems away

He laughs at them

LIAM
No I don’t want your money I just
want you to suffer I want to kill
Kelsie first and make you watch as
she dies You know I used to think
about the kind of cuts I would make
on her The depth and the severity
of the incisions Just to be extra
careful that she’d die slowly in
your arms Kevin

KEVIN
Why would you want to hurt us

LIAM
Because of what you did to my
family

KEVIN

What We didn’t do anything to
your family

Liam runs his hands roughly through his dark hair digging
his nails into his scalp

KEVIN
I swear to you I swear to God
Liam I’ve never seen you before in
my life

KELSIE
You have the wrong people

LIAM
Not possible I had to be sure of
it before I took a chance like
this

KEVIN
Sure of what I have no idea what
you’re talking about

LIAM
You two murdered my son

KEVIN
What Liam you have the wrong
people Whatever happened to your
son I’m sorry but look at us
Were not killers I promise

Liam nods his head as if he accepts this answer

KEVIN
But that doesn’t mean we can’t help
you If someone hurt your family
you have a right to bring them to
justice

KELSIE
Your uncle Kev

KEVIN
My uncle’s a criminal investigator
for the NYPD I can help you We
get out of here I can bring your
case to him Okay Really I’1l do
that for you

Liam grabs Kevin drives him by the throat into the side of
the elevator There’s no chance of fighting back against his
strength He’s easily overpowered

LIAM
Youve been to County Cork Aye
you were there July 16th 2008
Dunmar Road Shortly after nine at
night That ring any bells-- Kev

KELSIE
What the fuck is the matter with
you Let go of him

LIAM
Shut that bitch up or I will

KEVIN
Stay back Kelsie

LIAM
Second time Kev July 16th 2008
County Cork Dunmar Road 9PM

KEVIN
No I mean-- Yes we went to
Ireland that summer but I don’t
remember all the places we visited
And I don’t remember meeting you
Please just listen to me you have
the wrong couple

Liam leans into Kevin’s face

Kelsie backs away into the corner scared out of her mind

LIAM
You were driving fast as hell on
the wrong side of the road Typical
fuckin’ moron Americans In your
little blue convertible What was
it again Kevin Saab Oh no
that’s right An Opel Did you
frequent the bars that night

KEVIN
I don’t remember

He slams his head against the wall

LIAM
Think

KEVIN
Yeah Probably

KELSIE
Please don’t hurt him

He holds the blade to Kevin’s throat looks back to Kelsie

LIAM
Tell me or I’1l1 slice him apart

KELSIE
I don’t know anything

The blade digs into Kevin’s skin A drop of blood runs down

LIAM
You went to the pub Then you got
back in your car and you drove to
whatever Grandma bed and breakfast
you were staying at You came from
town along Delaney turned on
Dunmar The same time my son and I
were walking home

KEVIN
I don’t remember those details-—

LIAM
I’1l include a few more to help you
out then Patrick was down the road
a bit when you came swerving around
the turns I tried to scream to him
but he couldn’t hear me past the
roar of your engine

(MORE)

LIAM (CONTD)
You switched into the wrong lane
and you struck my son in the body
breaking seventeen bones on impact
and throwing him fifteen feet into
a ravine

Liam wipes at his mouth his eyes red Gripping the knife
fighting back emotion

LIAM
He drowned before I could get to
him In a foot of muddy water

He shakes his head as if to send the memories away

LIAM
I carried his wet body two miles
back to our family’s house I
couldn’t tell if it was the water
or his blood dripping down my arms
You can’t even begin to imagine
what that’s like Holding the thing
you love most Feeling that person
dead in your arms I’ve been
haunted by him every day

Liam releases Kevin and slides down to a squat He puts his
head in his hands the blade up to his forehead We can see
the pain burning in his eyes The emotion The tears Months
of anguish and grief

He looks back up at them stares at Kevin hard

LIAM
You know what the worst part was
about what you did Kev

KEVIN
Liam--

LIAM
If you only would have helped him
Pulled him out of the water My son
would be ten-years-old today If
you had the decency the humanity
to just help him

Kevin shakes his head looks over at Kelsie her terrified
face

LIAM
Now How about you look at me one
more time and tell me to my face
that you didn’t kill my son

He stands back up the knife out before him

Liam nods

KEVIN
I’m so sorry

KEVIN
It’s a tremendous loss and I can’t
imagine the pain you’ve endured
but you have to believe me We
didn’t kill your son Because if we
did I swear to God on my soul
that I would have stopped the car
and helped him

LIAM
Aye But you did stop

KEVIN
What

LIAM
When I got there you were pulled
over I didn’t see you or the tags
but I saw the car

KEVIN
Okay Well hundreds of people drive
blue Opels You didn’t see the
tags You didn’t see me Think
about that How can you be sure

LIAM
Because I saw her

Kevin looks at Kelsie

KEVIN
What

KELSIE
I think you’re-- mistaken

LIAM
You didn’t see me but I saw you

KELSIE
Kev he’s wrong He was in shock
He could have seen anyone driving

LIAM
I didn’t say you were driving

KELSIE
This is ridiculous I didn’t kill
your son

LIAM

You saw what you did Then you got
back in your car and you drove
away

KELSIE
He’s wrong

LIAM
Don’t tell me what I am You killed
him Admit it

She stays behind Kevin Liam wipes at his eyes

KEVIN
Liam my wife’s not a liar and
she’s not a murderer She’s a good
person She wouldn’t do something
like that

Liam shakes his head drops down to a squat digs the knife
into the steel floor

LIAM
I tracked you down Blue Rental
Cars Rented by American females in
Ireland Especially any returned
with dents in them It took a long
time to find you

He smiles

LIAM
So much work Tonight was the
night I’d finally come face to
face with you two Finally confront
you alone Make you feel my pain

He reaches down and sheathes the knife wipes at his eyes

LIAM
And then I met you Just married
Starting a life I’m a broken
father I’ve boiled with anger for
a long time but I’m a good
Catholic I’m not an evil man I’m
not a killer I won’t stoop to your
level

Kelsie reaches a hand to Kevin He squeezes it

Liam walks over and grabs the HAND-HELD CAMERA turns it on
and zooms in on both of them

LIAM (0S)
I want your confession I want you
to admit what I know is already
true It was you that night in
that car You killed my son and you
left him there to die

Kevin stares at Kelsie her face dead serious

KEVIN
Kelsie did something happen I
don’t know about

KELSIE
Kevin come on

KEVIN
Be honest with me Kelsie

KELSIE
No He’s wrong

LIAM (0S)
You can face the law for your
crimes Pay the penalty and make
your own penance with the Lord
It’s the just way

KEVIN
Kelsie--

LIAM (0S)
I want you to confess Now

Kelsie steps up to the camera stares Liam down

KELSIE
You want a confession psycho
Here’s one We didn’t kill you’re
fuckin’ son You don’t have shit on
us The only crime being committed
here is kidnapping and attempted
murder So unless you want me to go
to the police for this elevator
stunt I suggest you start the
fuckin’ elevator and get out of my
face

KEVIN
Jesus-—-

LIAM (0S)
You’re going to hell for what you
did You know that

KELSIE
Start it

Liam shoves her away Kevin steps in front Liam pushes him
back pins him to the wall

The camera falls It shows their feet A struggle is heard

LIAM (0S)
Tell me you killed him

KEVIN (0S)
Liam listen to me

LIAM (0S)
TELL ME

Kelsie ducks down into frame grabs one of her stilettos She
swings it like a baseball bat with tremendous force

THE SICKENING CRUNCH OF STEEL PUNCTURING FLESH

Liam falls to the ground clutching his eye the heel
sticking out from his eye socket Blood pours out A thick
red current gushing over his face

Kelsie gets on top of him pulls the heel out and hits him
again and again burying the knife-like metal tip into his
skull

KEVIN
Jesus Christ Kelsie

He tries to pull her off She’s possessed She strikes him
over and over again

Kevin shoves her off

KEVIN
What the fuck are you doing

KELSIE
I had no choice

Kevin kneels into frame tries to hold back the blood gushing
from the puncture wounds in Liam’s skull

It courses over his fingers dyes his dress shirt red

KEVIN
He’s bleeding to death

KELSIE
Kevin I had no choice I swear

KEVIN
Help me put pressure on it

Liam’s leg twitches as the blood pumps out

Kelsie reaches down her hands in the warm blood We see it
seep across the steel floor

Kevins grip slips from the punctured eye ball It spurts
out paints his face and shirt red

KELSIE
It was self-defense You saw it

KEVIN
I don’t know

KELSIE
He was insane That crazy story
about killing his kid I mean come
on I’m innocent
Kevin stares down at Liam’s body Blood still pumping out

He listens for breath feels for pulse Neither

KELSIE
What is it

KEVIN
I think he’s dead

She reaches a hand to Kevin He shakes it off

KELSIE
I was only trying to help you

KEVIN
Okay Just-- Jesus Christ I need
to think

He tries to wipe the blood off his hands then picks up his
camera

KEVIN
It recorded everything

KELSIE
You should erase it

KEVIN
Are you kidding It doesn’t matter
what we say when we get out of
this All that matters is what this
camera saw It’s the only proof we
have that he came at me and you
acted in self-defense to save my
life We need to make sure we have
our story straight

KELSIE
They’1l believe us right

KEVIN (0S)
Who

KELSIE
The police

KEVIN (0S)
I don’t know

Kevin shakes his head turns away Kelsie reaches into Liam’s
pocket and takes out his iPhone

KELSIE
I just want to get the fuck off
this elevator

It slips from her bloody hands into the pool on the floor
Blood drains out of Liam’s mouth covering the face plate
seeping into the cracks of the phone

KELSIE
Shit Kevin

Kevin sees the phone quickly fishes it out tries to wipe
off the blood An impossible task

KELSIE
Is it okay

He tries turning it on The picture lights up then fizzles
out He takes the battery out It’s covered in blood

KEVIN
It’s fucked

He tries again Nothing
KEVIN
GODDAMMIT

KELSIE
I’m sorry

He throws the phone against the wall

KEVIN
That was our only way down

KELSIE
There has to be something else

KEVIN
I need you to be honest with me
Okay No bullshit There were a
couple nights in Ireland I got
drunk and you drove back A few I
don’t remember

KELSIE
What are you saying

KEVIN
Christ There was a dent The front
bumper and the hood You said you
hit a pole in the parking lot

KELSIE
I did I’m no good at driving I
live in fuckin’ Manhattan When do
I ever drive

KEVIN
Kelsie tell me the truth

KELSIE
What do you want me to say

KEVIN
You can’t lie about this

KELSIE
I hit a pole He’s fuckin’ insane
You believe me right Please Tell
me you believe me

She’s shaking covered in blood scared out of her mind

KEVIN
I do

He takes her in his arms holds her She rests her head on
his shoulder

KELSIE
Thank you

KEVIN
It’s important that we get our
story on camera though okay

She nods

He hands her the HAND-HELD CAMERA and she turns it on It
shows Kevin He speaks directly into it

KEVIN
I’m recording this as a testimony
to what just happened inside this
elevator We thought we were stuck
here by accident It turns out we
were being held captive by Liam
Collins who’s been stalking us for
weeks He threatened and accused my
wife and I of crimes we didn’t
commit And then came at me with a
knife He was going to kill me
There’s not a doubt in my mind In
my defense my wife Kelsie killed
him first She saved my life Since
no one could see what actually
happened this is proof that--

He stops looks off-camera at something

KELSIE (0S)
What is it

He points to the security camera Kelsie turns the hand-held
off

KELSIE
You think someone’s watching us

KEVIN
I don’t know

KELSIE
He said he had friends Maybe
someone else is out there Someone
saw what happened

KEVIN
It’s possible
A LOUD CLANG RIGHT OUTSIDE THE ELEVATOR

They both jump

Followed by ANOTHER and ANOTHER Each one in perfect timing

with the strike before it

KELSIE
Someone’s there

KEVIN
Hello

KELSIE

You think that’s smart

KEVIN
Our first priority is to get off
this elevator

She nods her agreement

KEVIN
We’re inside Hello

Kevin whistles loudly Kelsie BANGS on the doors
No one answers

ANOTHER LOUD CLANG And ANOTHER

The lights switch over to BRIGHT RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS The

elevator fills with red

KELSIE
What is that

KEVIN
Emergency lights I think

CLANG CLANG CLANG
Kelsie covers her ears

KELSIE
Jesus Christ That’s loud

KEVIN
Is anyone there

LOUDER FASTER

Kelsie slides down to a squat lets the hand-held camera go

Kevin cups his ears bends over

AN EAR-PIERCING IMPOSSIBLY LOUD SOUND then--
ABRUPT SILENCE
The lights switch back over to normal
KELSIE
(still holding her ears)
What the hell was that

KEVIN
Is anyone there

He SLAMS his fists on the door kicks at it tries pressing
the buttons No response

KELSIE
Why wouldn’t they answer us

KEVIN
There must be other people out
there Working with Liam

KELSIE
And they know he’s dead

KEVIN
Probably

Kevin picks up the hand-held camera stares into it
We can see the terror in his eyes

KELSIE (0S)
They’re gonna come for us

KEVIN
One way or another

CAMERA CUTS OUT

COMPILED SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE
WE FAST-FORWARD THROUGH ANOTHER THIRTY MINUTES OF TAPE

We can see the temperature in the elevator rise
precipitously

Both are sweating badly fanning themselves constantly
shedding any unnecessary clothing

They’re banging on the doors pressing the elevator buttons
Their feet leave bloody footprints around the car

INT ELEVATOR - (1003 PM) - (3 HR 28 MINUTES TRAPPED)

The HAND-HELD CAMERA shakes focuses in on Kevin He’s
sweating flushed looks like he just ran ten miles

KEVIN
(into the camera)
Someone’s messing with us It’s
pretty clear Liam wasn’t working
alone Whoever was helping him
knows we’re trapped inside They
must know he’s dead

He wipes at his forehead

KEVIN
The temperature’s gone up twenty
degrees over the past half hour I
found a vent near the ceiling that
must control the heat It’s pumping
in hot air I couldn’t close it

Kevin lies chest-down near the crack between the concrete
wall and the sill in the door Liam’s congealed blood inches
away from his face

KEVIN
The air below’s warm

KELSIE
You think they lit a fire

KEVIN
We’d smell smoke Alarms would be
going off all over the building
Besides I doubt they’d want to
alert the attention of the fire
department Not while they’re
having their fun with us

Kelsie bangs on the doors
KELSIE

We know you’re there Let us out of
here

KEVIN
Kelsie it won’t matter If they
wanted to talk to us they’d be
talking to us

KELSIE
I need water

Kevin digs through their carry-on bags finds half a bottle
of water

KEVIN
Here

KELSIE
Thank God

She takes a deep sip Kevin looks down at Liam his face a
bloody mangled mess

KELSIE
You want some

KEVIN
No You drink it

He picks up the camera looks at it head-on
KEVIN

We have to think There’s gotta be
something

Kelsie’s behind the HAND-HELD CAMERA It refocuses on the row
of elevator buttons

KEVIN
Show the buttons Zoom in

Kelsie zooms in on the elevator buttons They’re lighting up
quickly one after the other Starting at the top floor and
moving down

KEVIN
They restored the power

Kevin presses the intercom button and jumps back collides
into Kelsie

The camera shakes lands on the floor We see a CLOSE UP view
of Liam’s bloody face

Kevin SCREAMS in pain

KELSIE (0S)
You okay Kevin what happened

KEVIN (0S)
It burned my finger

KELSIE (0S)

KEVIN (0S)
Get a shot of this

Kelsie picks up the camera wipes a few drops of blood off
the lens

KEVIN
Christ that hurts

Kevin shows his finger to the camera It’s bright red A
white blister bubbles from his skin

KELSIE (0S)
They were trying to trick you

KEVIN
Yeah well-- Anything they do to
hurt or scare us it’s just more
proof we have against them

KELSIE
Kevin look

She pans over to the call buttons The intercom button which
he pressed only seconds before is melting The plastic oozes
out of the wall drips to the ground

A RED BEAM OF LIGHT shines from the hole Kevin squats down
stares into it

KEVIN
It melted right off Let me see the
camera I want to get a shot of
this

She hands it over

KEVIN (0S)
I can see inside

KELSIE (0S)
You see anything

KEVIN (0S)
Just this bright red light

Kevin zooms in further--
A LOUD CLANG behind them They jump The camera shakes
The DOORS DING and open

KEVIN (0S)
They’re controlling everything

The lights above flicker Kelsie looks up

STATIC OVER THE EMERGENCY PHONE Giving way to the SOUND OF
MUMBLED VOICES someone trying to speak to them

Kevin kneels down by the intercom
KEVIN (0S)
The button’s gone I can’t say

anything

Kelsie BANGS on the walls tries to speak to whoever’s out
there

KELSIE

You can hear us I know you can
Let us out

STATIC FROM THE INTERCOM

Giving way to a creepy ANDROGYNOUS VOICE speaking only in
hushed whispers

VOICE (0S)
I saw what you did

KELSIE
What the hell was that

KEVIN (0S)
It came from the intercom

STATIC BARELY AUDIBLE Kevin holds up the camera turns up
the volume to capture the voice

VOICE (VO)
Youre going to die

The Voice disappears in a sea of static before SILENCE

KELSIE
What did it say

KEVIN (0S)
It said we’re gonna die Someone’s
definitely out there Threatening
us

KELSIE
Some sick fuckin’ joke

KEVIN (0S)
I don’t think they’re joking
Considering what you did to their
friend
KELSIE
I was trying to help you He was
gonna kill you
Kevin turns the camera on himself Close-up of his face

KELSIE
You agree right

He flicks a few switches

KELSIE

CAMERA CUTS OUT

COMPILED SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE
WE FAST-FORWARD THROUGH ANOTHER FIFTEEN MINUTES OF TAPE

Kevin and Kelsie listen carefully put their ears up to the
sides of the elevator

Kevin searches around the roof panel pulls hard trying to
free the latch Can’t get it to budge

He searches through Liam’s pockets Pulls out a wallet
Nothing of importance

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR (1034 PM) - (3 HR 59 MINUTES TRAPPED)

Theyre sitting by opposite walls Kevin’s holding his burned
finger

KELSIE
What are we gonna do

He ignores her

KELSIE
Kev
Still ignores her
KELSIE
Kev
KEVIN

Fuck What I’m thinking Okay I
don’t know what to do You have any
ideas I’d be happy to hear them

KELSIE
Don’t yell at me

KEVIN
It’s just-- if I knew what to do
Id be doing it We’re trapped in
here End of fuckin’ story

There’s a STRANGE SOUND like cables buckling bending from
somewhere above them

KELSIE
What is that

KEVIN
It sounds like the cables

KELSIE
They’re cutting them

KEVIN
They’re steel cables It’s not
exactly the easiest thing to cut
Wed hear power tools even if they
were trying It’s impossible--

In an instant the elevator drops The rush of gravity turns
both their stomachs They SCREAM

Voices lost behind the HORRIBLE SOUND OF METAL GRINDING METAL
as the car rockets to the ground below

The elevator catches itself The force propels Kevin and
Kelsie to the floor

KEVIN
Kelsie

She’s on top of Liam covered in blood

KEVIN
You okay

KELSIE
They dropped us You said they
couldn’t

KEVIN
I said they couldn’t cut the
cables I didn’t say they couldn’t
move the elevator
He helps her up They steady themselves

KEVIN
You feel that

KELSIE
Were going back up

The elevator rises then holds
KEVIN
We may be at a floor Help me with
the doors

They pull at the doors

KEVIN
SHIT

Kevin picks up the HAND-HELD CAMERA focuses in on the same
concrete wall The painted number twelve

KELSIE
That was a warning They could drop
us to our death any time they want

Kevin returns the camera to their bags stares into it

KEVIN
No they can’t

KELSIE
Well sorry Kev But I think they
know a little more about elevators
than--

CAMERA CUTS OUT

CAMERA CUTS IN

Were staring through the HAND-HELD CAMERA We see only
metal The ceiling of the elevator above the lights

KEVIN (0S)
There’s nothing up here

KELSIE
I don’t even know what we’re
looking for

Kevin puts the camera back on their bags

KEVIN
He was using his phone to control
the elevator right It must be
connected to a transponder like he

said

KELSIE
You know I don’t understand tech
talk

KEVIN

Look in order to get a signal to a
phone that would work in here a
transponder would have to be close
by Find that and I can use it to
manually start the elevator

Kevin looks around pulls on the elevator paneling Nothing
budges

KELSIE
What if he hid it outside the car

KEVIN
Itd be tough getting a signal
through the steel doors If he
wanted to guarantee it worked he’d
hide it inside the elevator

Kevin picks up the camera pans around the elevator stops on
the row of call buttons

Carefully he reaches into frame pulls at the face plate We

see one of the screws is loose

KEVIN
Hold this

KELSIE
You found it

KEVIN
Maybe

Kevin kneels down to Liam’s body

He hesitates not wanting to touch him then lifts him up

KELSIE
Be careful

Blood oozes out of the puncture wounds in Liam’s head

Kevin finds the knife unstraps it and pulls it out He
returns to the call buttons and jams it behind the faceplate

KEVIN
I bet it’s back here

Another heave and the plate loosens He pulls out the

remaining screws

A hundred wires A dozen different colors

He starts fishing around pulling wires back

KELSIE
Is it there

KEVIN
I don’t see it

KELSIE
Great

KEVIN

Hang on I might be able to reroute
these wires though That would
bypass the transponder and restore
power back to the car

KELSIE
Stop explaining it Just do it

He detaches a few wires plugs a few more back

in

KELSIE
You have any idea what you’re
doing

KEVIN

My job never required me to bypass
an elevator I’m hoping for a
little luck
The lights go out blanketing the car in blackness
KEVIN (0S)
Wrong wire I can’t see anything
Give me the camera

He reaches into the dark grabs the camera and flips on NIGHT
VISION

Our camera lights up sickly green light saturates
everything

He zooms in on the wires

KEVIN
Fuck there’s so many wires

KELSIE’S VOICE (V0)
I didn’t kill your son

Kevin jumps the camera shakes He pans over to Kelsie She
looks scared out of her mind

KEVIN (0S)
What

KELSIE
I didn’t say that

From somewhere behind her outside the car--

KELSIE’S VOICE (V0)
I didn’t kill your son

KELSIE
How’s it doing that

KEVIN (0S)
I don’t know

KELSIE
Kev

KEVIN (0S)

They must have recorded everything
Our entire conversation in here
They’re playing it back

Again we hear Kelsie’s voice softer now

KELSIE’S VOICE (VO)
You know what worries me the most
though

Kevin pans from Kelsie’s panicked face to the cold steel
walls They’re powerless to do anything Only listen

KELSIE’S VOICE (VO)
No one knows we’re here

KELSIE
What the fuck

KEVIN (0S)

Keep your voice down from now on
If you want to talk talk in
whispers They can’t record what
they can’t hear

A LOUD CLANG behind them KELSIE SCREAMS

The camera shakes as they jolt to their feet Kevin
refocuses Everything bathed in green light

A HORRIBLE SCRAPING SOUND is heard outside the elevator like
someone slowly dragging a rusty rake across the outside of
the car

KELSIE
What is that

KEVIN (0S)
Stay next to me

The SCRAPING SOUND continues--

Slowly around them until it encircles the elevator

KELSIE
They’re trying to cut their way
inside

KEVIN (0S)

That’s impossible

KELSIE
How do you know

They stand huddled in the middle shaking with fear

THE ELEVATOR ALARM GOES OFF EAR-SPLITTING

Kevin throws the camera on their bags and covers his ears
STATIC OVER THE INTERCOM

The DOORS DING and open revealing a glimpse of the concrete
wall Then quickly close

Open Close OPEN CLOSE

Kevin pulls Kelsie to the back of the car She trips over
Liam’s body

The ALARM gets even LOUDER before once again--
ABRUPT SILENCE

The lights come back on blinding the camera It
automatically switches off night vision

KEVIN
They can see us

KELSIE
How

KEVIN

The security camera They saw I was
tampering with the wires I should
have thought of that

He walks over and digs into their luggage

KEVIN
Where’d you put the gum
KELSIE
What
KEVIN
Chewing gum For the flight Where
is it
KELSIE

Front pocket I think
Kevin pulls out a pack of gum and stuffs a piece in his
mouth He reaches into his wallet and takes out a business
card

CUT TO

COMPILED SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE

We see Kevin step up on the hand-rail and peer into the
camera He stares at it studies us head on

Then takes the wad of gum out of his mouth and sticks it to
the back of the business card which he adheres to the
security camera blacking out our view

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR (1048 PM) - (4 HR 13 MINUTES TRAPPED)
Kevin looks at Kelsie walks back over to the camera

KEVIN
They can’t see us now They can’t
hear us It’s like a chess game We
just have to think a few moves
ahead

She nods wipes the sweat off her forehead leaving a streak
of Liam’s blood on her face

KEVIN
Come here

He takes her shaking body and uses his sleeve to clean it
off

KEVIN
Listen We’re gonna be fine We’re
gonna find a way out of here and
then explain what happened

KELSIE
By showing them the tape

KEVIN
It’s all there

He wraps his arms around her

KEVIN
Time is working for us Sooner or
later the real elevator crew will
show up and help us Until then
were safe in here

KELSIE
Bullshit

KEVIN
Look whoever’s out there Whoever
wants to hurt us They can’t get to
us while we’re inside a box Fuck
‘em They can shut doors make
sounds turn the lights on and off
but they can’t change the fact that
to get to us they’d have to let us
out

He walks back over to the HAND-HELD CAMERA leans into us in
close-up

KEVIN
I only have a quarter battery left

KELSIE (0S)
You promise me That they can’t
hurt us in here

He looks over his shoulder at her

From the ceiling panels WATER trickles down the walls of the
car pooling on the floor

Kevin reaches into frame touches the wet walls

KELSIE (0S)
They’re flooding us

The camera zooms in on the ceiling Water sprinkles on the

KELSIE
Kev--

KEVIN
I don’t know Kelsie but keep your
voice down

KELSIE
How much time do we have

He ignores her goes back to the buttons stars fiddling with
the wires again

Kelsie looks down at her feet A thin sheet of water covers
the floor mixing in with Liam’s blood Dark reddish brown

Kevin attaches another wire The lobby button lights up He
presses it Nothing

KEVIN
Come on just work

He reaches his arm farther into the electrical panel and
firmly attaches a wire

The DOORS DING and opens Wrong one

KEVIN
Dammit

Water rains down outside the open elevator doors Kelsie
walks over holds her hand out The dirty water collecting in
her palm rolling down her wrist

The water drips down the wall into the electrical wiring as
Kevin reaches in

He flinches shouts pulls back in pain

KELSIE
You okay

KEVIN
It shocked me Jesus Christ All
these wires this is ridiculous
Where’s the fuck’s that
transponder

He looks around the elevator again What did he miss

KELSIE
Just keep trying It’1ll work

Kevin shakes his head walks over and opens his carry-on He
pulls out his bathing suit and dries his hands off

STATIC OVER THE INTERCOM

KELSIE
Someone’s there

They lean into the speaker the muddy water rolling by their
faces

KEVIN
I don’t hear anything

KELSIE
Me neither

KEVIN
(whispering)
I have an idea Maybe we can draw
them out somehow

KELSIE
How

KEVIN
By challenging them

He walks over to the open door

KEVIN
Hey you fuckin’ cowards I know
you’re out there Why don’t you
stop hiding like a bunch of fuckin’
pussies and face me

SILENCE

Kevin leans his head out the door tries to scream up the
shaft

KEVIN
Yeah that’ what I thought A bunch
of fuckin’ pussies That’s what you
are

The DOORS DING and quickly shut with tremendous speed and
force

Kevin pulls his head back in seconds before they SLAM

He pries at the doors tries to force them back

KEVIN
Help me Come on We have to get
these doors open

Kelsie pulls hard on the other door They can’t get them to
budge

KELSIE
I can’t get it

KEVIN
It’s sealed shut

He bangs on the door

KELSIE
Who cares about the doors

KEVIN
It’s a big problem

She follows his gaze to the floor We see the water already
collecting The car’s slowly filling up

The lights switch over to red emergency lights bathing them
both in a blood-red glow

KELSIE
We’re gonna drown in here

THE ALARM SOUNDS AT A DEAFENING VOLUME They both shield
their ears before once again--

ABRUPT SILENCE
The lights switch back over to normal The static on the

intercom dissipates gives way to music followed by a clear
voice

The 1952 RECORDING of

“How Much is that Doggie in the Window”
RECORDING (V0)

“How much is that doggie in the

window The one with the waggily

tail--”

Kevin and Kelsie stare at each other

KELSIE
What the-- fuck

RECORDING (VO)
“How much is that doggie in the
window I do hope that doggie’s for
sale”

KELSIE
Some kind of joke

KEVIN
It’s not funny

He goes back over to the call buttons starts messing with
the wires

Kelsie picks up the HAND-HELD CAMERA and films the intercom
recording the song She looks down at the pooling water
already up to their shins

quickly over her fingers

We see it’s now up to their knees Their bags waterlogged
KELSIE
There’s more of it It’s pouring in
faster now

She turns back to him

KELSIE
Hey Kev you okay

He’s doubled over gripping his stomach a pained expression
on his face

KEVIN
My stomach hurts Serious pains

KELSIE
You feel nauseous

KEVIN
No Like sharp stabbing pains

A CRACKING SOUND like ice breaking Kelsie looks around
unsure where it’s coming from

KEVIN
Get away from the glass

Slowly from the top of the mirror a crack forms starts
crawling its way across the glass

KELSIE
Is the water doing that

KEVIN
I don’t know Stay away from it

From behind them the second mirror starts to crack

The cracks spiderweb across the glass giving off warped
reflections of the passengers

Then at once the cracks stop
SILENCE

Kelsie pans the hand-held back to Kevin’s face He realizes
something

KELSIE (0S)
What is it

KEVIN
The water

KELSIE (0S)

KEVIN
His son Remember He said he found
his son drowned in a foot of
muddy water

The side of the walls are awash in dirty water pouring in
An inch every few seconds

It’s waist deep rising fast Kevin tries to pull at the
wires but it’s no use They’re completely submerged now

Their bags float next to them We see the HAND-HELD CAMERA
teetering on the edge of their bags Kevin goes for it but
it’s too late It slips into the dark water ruined

KEVIN
Shit

KELSIE
It doesn’t matter

They’re both freezing shivering badly Kevin wades over and
holds Kelsie He looks weak pale As if he was coming down
with the flu

KEVIN
It’s gonna be alright

She shakes her head fighting back tears The water rises to
their chests

KELSIE
Don’t let go of me

KEVIN
I wont

He coughs again tries to control it It sounds terrible

KEVIN
Shit

The water rises up Kelsie’s chest to her chin

KELSIE
I can’t stand any longer

KEVIN
Get on the handrail You feel it

He helps her up She finds the bar with her feet
KEVIN
Hold on to the top There’s a latch
by the roof

KELSIE
There’s room for you too

KEVIN
I’m alright

The water pours in now in thick dark sheets down all sides
of the car

The weight of which fills up Liam’s body They watch as he
sinks into the depths below

Kevin coughs as the water reaches his chin He starts
treading water

KELSIE
Grab the top Kev

He knocks away the floating stiletto heels and grabs the
roof pulls himself above the water

KEVIN
I’m gonna go under Kelsie I’1l be
back

The water reaches Kelsie’s face seeps into her mouth She
spits it out

KELSIE
I don’t want to die Please--

KEVIN
I love you Kelsie

He takes a deep breath One Then Two

And he’s under

INT UNDER WATER - CONTINUOUS

Kevin ducks under the water opens his eyes Blackness He
can barely make out his own hands in front of him

Liam’s dead face appears suddenly startling him his
lifeless eyes staring right at him

Kevin pushes him away swims downward

INT ABOVE WATER -—

Kelsie has her mouth to the top of the ceiling There’s no
room left

The water overtakes her face She holds her breath and dives
under
INT UNDER WATER —-

Kevin frantically searches He’s looking for something Where
is it
Something shimmers It’s all he needs He finds Liam’s knife

and swims to the open call buttons

We see the mess of useless wires appear before him He spits
out air as his body contracts fighting itself

With a thrust he stabs the blade through the circuit panel
It slices through wires and CLANGS into the side of the car
making a small dent

Another thrust harder this time and the knife punctures
through A HISS as water spurts out

He winds up one more time his last chance and plunges the
blade through the call box It rips through the side of the
car He twists the blade warping the metal Leaving a silver-
dollar sized hole

Water shoots out

He swims for the roof grabbing Kelsie by the dress and
pulling her up to the ceiling

INT ABOVE WATER -

They reach the top and both cough violently Their lungs
expel water fill with oxygen

KEVIN
You okay

KELSIE
Yeah

The water drains down

The rush of water loosens Kevin’s gum and the business card
floats away revealing the two of them treading water
barely afloat

FAST-FORWARD THROUGH ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES OF TAPE

The water recedes down to waist-level again exposing the
wires

Both can stand For a while they just hold each other
shivering trying to keep each other warm wiping the water
off each other’s faces

The stomach pains gets back to Kevin He doubles-over at one
point She holds his shoulders

INT ELEVATOR - (1218 AM) - (5 HR 43 MINUTES TRAPPED)

Kevin’s leaning against the wall the water coursing over his
body His head down his shoulders slumped

Kelsie wipes at her eyes Make-up smeared across her face
her hair stringy

KELSIE
How are you feeling

KEVIN
Worse

He reaches a limp hand to the soaked wires

KEVIN
Wires are shot They’re completely
fried

KELSIE

It’s okay

KEVIN
It’s not

The lights switch over to RED EMERGENCY LIGHTS bathing both
of them in red Causing the dark waist-high water to take on
the distinct appearance of blood

From somewhere outside the car we hear something The SOUND
OF FOOTSTEPS running pitter-patter The distinct sound a
child would make running across a wood floor

KELSIE
What is that

Kevin doesn’t answer His head hung low The FOOTSTEPS
continue around the outside of the car

Kelsie follows them as they circle around her Her body
shaking freezing in the cold water

KELSIE
It sounds like footsteps

She looks over at Kevin His limp body completely
unresponsive

MORE FOOTSTEPS This time across the roof of the car

KELSIE
There’s someone up there HELLO

SILENCE

KELSIE
LET US OUT OF HERE

A CHILD GIGGLES
KELSIE
Did you hear that Kevin That
sounds like a kid

Kevin looks up at her His eyes glazed over

KEVIN
Where are you I’m scared

Kelsie ignores him looks around the ceiling searching for
the child’s laughter

KELSIE
It’s a kid I swear to God I just
heard a kid

KEVIN
Help me Daddy Please
Kelsie freezes at this looks over at him

KELSIE
What Kevin what

She wades over and grabs him

He just stares at her As if whatever used to be Kevin is
long gone

KELSIE

KELSIE
Why are you talking like that
KEVIN
Help me Pull me out of the water

Jesus Christ
Liam’s body resurfaces floats next to them

KEVIN

She then notices something Something strange on Liam’s body

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR - (1232 AM) - (5 HR 57 MINUTES TRAPPED)

Kelsie reaches to Liam’s body There’s something bulging from
under his shirt Right above his waist

She lifts up the wet fabric A SMALL BLACK BOX is taped to
his skin A red light blinking ever so slowly

KELSIE
Is this it

She pulls at the box and detaches it It’s no bigger than a
garage door opener

With a click she pulls down a small panel Inside a bunch of
buttons It doesn’t appear to be damaged by the water

KELSIE
Kev I found it I found the
transponder

She looks at the buttons unsure how to operate it She
starts pressing them

The DOORS DING and shut

KELSIE
How do I use this

She kneels in to Kevin
CLOSE ON his eyes Slowly they turn to look at her
KELSIE
I have it Look We can get out of
here now

She presses another button The lights return to normal

KELSIE
What do I do

We see Kevin His actions methodical zombie-like He reaches
across the floor and picks up Liam’s knife

KELSIE
Kevin Can you hear me

She backs away from him

You’re hurting me Please let go

KELSIE
Kevin--

KEVIN

SAY IT

She opens her mouth Moments before passing out from lack of
oxygen--

KELSIE
Please Okay-- Yes

Kevin releases his grip Kelsie drops back down coughs as
her windpipe expands with air

He lowers the knife to her inches from her face

He places the blade on her cheek She flinches at the cold
steel jumps back starts to cry

KELSIE
Don’t do this Kevin

KEVIN
Tell me what you did

She tries to compose herself Every word a struggle

KELSIE
You were passed out I got in the
car I probably shouldn’t have
driven but--

KELSIE
It was dark I lost control and
swerved off the road It happened
so fast

She slouches down The water guilt washing over her

KELSIE
I saw his face He looked right at
me when I hit him It was the most
awful sound

Kevin grabs her by the hair and pulls her back to her feet
Then pulls her hair back exposing her neck

KELSIE
Kevin it’s me Something’s wrong
with you Just look at me

She struggles tries to shove him off her He pins her
against the wall
KEVIN
Then what happened

She looks into his eyes searches for her husband

KELSIE
I pulled the car over I could see
him in the ravine I wanted to help
but I was so scared

KEVIN
I was still alive

KELSIE
What

He smacks her head against the wall
5

KEVIN
I was drowning

KELSIE
Then I heard a man Screaming and
running towards me I was
terrified I only had a few seconds
to react

Kelsie looks up at the buttons She’s almost down

KELSIE
I got back in the car and I drove
away You woke up around them

Kevin stares at her his eyes sharp unblinking

KELSIE
I told you I hit a pole in the
parking lot

KEVIN
Is that all

KELSIE
I stayed up cleaned off the car
There was blood all over the place
It took an hour to wipe it down

Tears drip down her cheek cling to her wet face

He’s gone

KELSIE
I’m so sorry

KELSIE
Please know how sorry I am

KEVIN
Ido

There’s a SLICING SOUND as Kevin buries the knife deep into
Kelsie’s stomach

She chokes He stares into her eyes She chokes again and
coughs up blood It dots Kevin’s face

KELSIE
Please--

She looks down at the blade handle sticking out of her
stomach She puts her hands on his tries to pull them back

3

KELSIE
Kev--

He rips the knife out and jams it back into her body She
convulses around it

Blood runs down the side of the wall pools around her feet
collects by Liam’s lifeless eyes by the black stilettos

He rips the blade out and SLAMS it back into her sternum The
whole time staring into her eyes

Her arms drop to her side Blood flows down the wall
He pulls the knife out once more and she collapses

Enough life left in her to stare up at him Her vision goes
hazy then refocuses

Kevin leans in over her face The final thing she sees
He stabs the knife into her chest

CUT TO

COMPILED SECURITY TAPE FOOTAGE

Kevin pulls the knife out of Kelsie’s chest He then very
methodically turns and sits down between her dead body and
Liam’s and waits

We see the final glimmer of life leave Kelsie’s eyes

CUT TO

INT MANHATTAN MUNICIPAL BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT

The Fire Captain backs his men away from the elevator The
doors open

The wet blood-stained elevator Kevin sitting in the middle
clutching the knife

FIRE CAPTAIN
Jesus Christ get the police now

The men barely move

FIRE CAPTAIN
Now

They disperse The captain walks in He kicks away the knife
checks Kelsie’s pulse then Liam’s

Kevin shakes his head blinks a few times He’s waking up
coming to

He sees Kelsie her lifeless eyes The pool of blood forming
around her body

KEVIN
Oh my God KELSIE

He shakes her cradles her head in his arms
FIRE CAPTAIN
What happened in here Hey WHAT
HAPPENED

Kevin stares at him holding his wife feeling her dead in
his arms

KEVIN
I don’t know

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL - SOMETIME LATER - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a nurse’s heels and they CLICK-CLACK down the empty
sterile hallways

She’s passed by FRANK FORD well-dressed attorney
expensive suit tired eyes

He flashes credentials to a desk A BUZZ is heard and the
steel door opens

INT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL - VISITATION ROOM - NIGHT
A small enclosed room

Frank sets his briefcase by his side and checks his watch On
the table before him a TV MONITOR Frank turns it on

Another BUZZ and the door opens

Kevin is escorted in by two nurses There are handcuffs
around his wrists and ankles He moves with a shuffle When
he sits we get a full look at his face A terrified
expression His eyes silently begging for help

Frank waits for the nurses to leave

FRANK
How are you feeling today Kevin

KEVIN
I need to get out of here Please
get me out of here

Frank sighs Kevin stops talking

FRANK
Look as your attorney it’s my job
to help you okay I’1l do whatever
I can But you gotta’ understand
how severe of a position youre in

KEVIN
It must have been Patrick Liam’s
son He took control of me somehow
Please You have to believe me

FRANK
What Like a ghost
KEVIN
It must be

Frank nods his head adjusts his tie

FRANK
I believe you

KEVIN
You do

FRANK
Of course I think you should tell
the judge exactly that With a plea
of insanity you have a great
change of getting it

KEVIN
I’m not insane

FRANK
Of course you’re not

KEVIN
What’s gonna happen to me

FRANK
Hopefully you’1l remain here under
the care of Bellevue Hospital It’s
far nicer than where Kelsie’s
family wants to send you

KEVIN
For how long For life

FRANK
Well well see

KEVIN
No Listen to me please I’m
innocent I didn’t kill Kelsie

FRANK
All I can do it look at your case
the same way the judge will At the
facts okay There’s security
footage Kelsie beat Liam Collins
to death on camera Less than two
hours later the same camera
recorded you stabbing her
repeatedly Your prints are on the
knife her blood all over you The
evidence is beyond overwhelming

KEVIN
I told you Liam’s son He tried to
drown us just like he drowned
then--

FRANK
Hang on Kevin Look the ghost of
some kid didn’t try to drown you A
water tank busted up on the roof A
shit ton of water came down through
the elevator shaft while you were
inside I was just there Thousands
of dollars of damage They still
haven’t fixed the damn thing

KEVIN
There’s a tape I had a hand-held
camera inside the elevator I made
sure we recorded everything
Everything is on that tape

Frank nods

KEVIN
You have to find it

FRANK
We did find it

Frank reaches over and presses “play” on the TV
ON THE TV
Kevin holds Kelsie’s hands They smile at each other

KEVIN (VO)
I’m sure there’s a hundred things
I’m not perfect at But being your
husband taking care of you and
loving you I know I can be perfect
at that I’d never do anything to
hurt you and I promise to make
sure you’re happy and always
smiling just like you are right
now

She laughs quickly wipes away a few tears

KELSIE (VO)
I wish I could top that I just
want to tell you that-- You’re my
best friend I’d never lie to you
Id never betray you You’re my
partner in life Forever

KEVIN (VO)
I love you

KELSIE (VO)
Love you too

The tape goes to STATIC

KEVIN
Where’s the rest of it

FRANK
That’s all there was Another five
hours of static if you want to
watch

Kevin just shakes his head “no”

FRANK
Okay here’s the plan You try and
relax Let me take care of
everything else And you’re gonna
be alright I promise

Frank gathers up his briefcase turns back

FRANK
There is one thing that doesn’t add
up for me Maybe you could help me
out just between us two Liam
Collins They searched his place
He was following you and your wife
Had it under his assumption that
you were involved in a hit and run
accident involving his son Irish
police records confirmed a case was
opened about the time you two were
there but dropped due to lack of
evidence You know anything about
that Anything at all

Kevin thinks about it a moment A chance to confess
KEVIN
FRANK
Alright Get some rest okay

KEVIN
Please don’t leave me here

Frank leaves

KEVIN
IT WASNT ME

INT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL - HOLDING CELLS - NIGHT
Two nurses escort the chained Kevin to his room

KEVIN
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME

INT KEVIN’S CELL - NIGHT
The nurses drop him on his bed and leave
A SNAP OF A BOLT-LOCK and Kevin’s alone

We see the holding cell is eerily similar to our elevator
The same size and dimensions The same steel walls

KEVIN
LET ME OUT OF HERE PLEASE LET ME
OUT OF HERE

CUT TO

INT BELLEVUE HOSPITAL - NURSE’S STATION - SAME TIME - NIGHT

Nurses DOREEN and RUTH casually monitor the cameras A RADIO
plays softly in the background

DOREEN
You see Idol last night

RUTH
I missed it and don’t tell me
‘cause I Tivo’d

DOREEN
You’re not gonna believe who they
got rid of I almost died

As the nurses drone on we zero in on the radio behind them
The DJ cues us to the last song

DJ
That was Bobby Vinton for you
there “Roses are Red Violets are
Blue” For this next one we’re
going all the way back to 1952 The
lovely Patti Page

The music keys in
“How Much is that Doggie in the Window”
As the music ramps up we ZOOM IN on the row of monitors

We see Kevin Still banging on his cell door screaming at
the top of lungs

RADIO (V0O)
“How much is that Doggie in the
window The one with the waggily
tail”
The screen flickers

Kevin turns around as if he heard something He looks up at
the camera right at us then backs away terrified

RADIO (V0O)
“How much is that Doggie in the
window I do hope that doggie’s for
sale”
The screen flickers again

Then suddenly--

We see the CLOSE-UP face of PATRICK COLLINS staring
right at us His dead skin Wet hair Soulless eyes

It’s fast but he’s there
And it looks like he’s angry

CAMERA CUTS OUT
