The locker room is packed with DANCERS (18-49) getting ready
for the shift talking laughing socializing touching
smacking each other’s butts to the music

JANET JACKSON (VO)

Destiny puts on her mascara as A MAN’s VOICE booms in-and-
out over the music

DJ We got a bit of entertainment for

fun together She’s not part of any group

Mom follows her off Destiny reaches for a glass of vodka and
downs it Then stands slings her bejeweled purse over her
shoulder Her clear heels turn

DJ (0S)

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Destiny I know I’m supposed to
think that what you did is terrible
