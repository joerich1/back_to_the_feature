IE FLIP CAM CELL PHONE FOOTAGE

The Badlands of South Dakota Young Indian cowboys at the
Great Plains rodeos on the Pine Ridge reservation At
parties in motel rooms on the road Harsh raw and wild

BRADY 21 years old riding saddle bronc at various rodeos

A final ride shows the near fatal moment when he is bucked
off and trampled beneath the horse sustaining a devastating
head injury The crowd gasps as people run to help the young
man lying crumpled on the ground

IE HOSPITALCORRAL (DREAM SEQUENCE)

Blackness Sounds of a rodeo Heavy breathing Blurry
flashing light

Brady’s eye blood clogged flutters open and closes The
blurry figures of doctors above him Blood smeared across the
white pillow

Intercutting linking Brady’s body to that of a horse’s body

Brady’s scar-covered right hand twitches violently Horse
hoofs kicking up dirt

Doctor’s hands put breathing tubes into Brady’s mouth and
down his throat Brady’s hands putting a metal horse bit
into a horse’s mouth

Doctor’s hands putting oxygen tubes around Brady’s face and
up his nose Brady’s hands putting a leather halter around
a horse’s face

Nurses’s hands holding Brady down putting straps over his
arms Brady puts a heavy saddle on the horse

Brady struggles trying to pull himself away from the bed
The horse Brady is breaking struggles not to be rode
bucking shaking neighing loudly

EXT PRAIRIE -— DAWN
The silence of a peaceful prairie at dusk

The sky shades of purple and orange Short grass rolling
hills Faint howls of coyotes in the distance

A small figure breaks the stillness
Brady walks across the plains wearing a hospital gown and
cowboy boots He has a gauze on the right side of his head
Fresh bruises around his eyes He has run away from the
hospital dazed and tired from the long walk

He splashes through a stream of mud and horse shit

He walks towards the warm orange light of the trailer house
in the distance

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Brady walks into the dim living room The light flickers He
is pale covered in sweat and out of breath

BRADY
Dad

He stands still No answer

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - LILLY’S ROOM - MORNING
Brady walks in and finds his little sister LILLY asleep She
is 14 year old bright spirited and on the brink of
womanhood She has Aspergers Syndrome
BRADY
Hey Lillian Do you know where
dad is

Lilly is still half-asleep

LILLY
No

BRADY
Ok Go back to sleep
INT BRADY’S TRAILER - BRADY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

Brady wakes up in bed covered in sweat

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - BATHROOM - MORNING
Brady throws up in the toilet bowl

He takes a handful of prescription medication

The bloody gauze is stapled to his head He feels the staples
with his fingers taking deep breaths and begins to pull them
out of his head with a hunting knife

The bloody staples drop onto the counter one by one

The fresh wound stitched together on the back of his shaven
head is shocking It looks fresh and raw

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Brady wraps his head with plastic wrap and takes a shower
awkwardly taking care that his head doesn’t get wet

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Brady walks through the messy living room towards the
fluorescent glow in the kitchen

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - KITCHEN - MORNING

Brady waits as the coffee brews spacing out

He takes a sip of the hot coffee Another sip

His right hand twitches suddenly and starts to shake
Surprised he quickly grabs it with his left hand but drops
the coffee cup It shatters to the ground coffee spilling

across the cracked vinyl floor

Panicked and confused Brady shakes his hand

EXT BRADY’S TRAILER - MORNING

In the blue dawn Brady can be seen from a distance walking
from the little trailer towards the corral where a pale
horse is tied up

EXT BRADY’S TRAILER - CORRAL - MORNING

Brady pets GUS his favorite horse and oldest companion
He’s a large and magnificent pale colored Palomino The
love between them is clear

Brady’s hand runs through Gus’s smooth coat

BRADY
It’s good to see you Gus
Brady notices a cut on Gus’s leg

BRADY (CONTD)
What did you get yourself into

He checks the wound nervously
BRADY (CONTD)
Fighting over mares again You’re

lucky it wasn’t any deeper

He wraps his arms around Gus’ neck like a child that has
been away from home too long

EXT BRADYS TRAILER - FRONT YARD - MORNING

Brady practices lassoing with a ranch rope He’s rusty
missing the target repeatedly

An old pick-up pulls up WAYNE Brady’s father an old-school
cowboy wearing a black denim jacket and cowboy hat comes
back drunk

Brady is not happy to see him

WAYNE
What the hell are you doing here

Brady ignores him
WAYNE (CONTD)
I seen Tanner at the bar and he
said you escaped

Wayne giggles as he climbs out of the pick-up

BRADY
Told you to check me out

WAYNE
Doctors said you had to stay
buddy
Wayne goes up to Brady

WAYNE (CONTD)
Give me a hug

Brady backs away
BRADY

Why don’t you just go inside and
sober up
WAYNE
Sober up Let me see you rope

Wayne points at the plastic steer dummy
WAYNE (CONTD)
Checking yourself out of the
hospital like your uncle Rowdy
Annoyed Brady ropes anyway and misses it again
Wayne starts laughing
WAYNE (CONTD)
What the hell Can’t you rope
anymore Maybe you should’ve stayed
in the hospital

Taking a deep breath Brady ignores him

WAYNE (CONT’D)
You got any chew

Brady sighs takes his tobacco chew out of his pocket and
tosses it to Wayne

Wayne puts the chew in his mouth and walks up to Brady again

WAYNE (CONTD)
Just give me a hug

Brady lets his father hug him His expression is blank
WAYNE (CONTD)
Your hat and chaps are in the
backseat Love ya
Wayne staggers away into the house Brady watches him for a
moment before going back to roping again

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - BRADY’S ROOM - MORNING

Brady puts his rodeo hat on the panelled wall He takes his
leather chaps and his spurs out of a black trash bag

He sits on the edge of the bed and cleans them

Wayne chucks down his beer

Brady stares blankly into his burger
EXT FAMILY CEMETORY - DAY

The Blackburn family grave yard - a cluster of wooden
crosses Some ancient and some new

Rusted horseshoes and weathered cowboy boots are scattered
around the long grass

Brady opens the barbwire gate A bell tied to the metal
chimes gently as he closes it behind him

Brady prays silently in front of his mother’s grave On the
wooden cross it reads Mari Blackburn 1963-2013 A few
children’s star stickers pasted on the weathered wood
Lilly’s handy work

Brady looks up at the wooden cross

BRADY
I was tough mom

The sound of bell chimes and long grass blowing in the wind
Brady sits there and listens

EXT BRADYS TRAILER - NIGHT
The sound of crickets and horned toads in the darkness
Brady walks down the wooden steps leading to the front door
He sits on the last step in the dreary porch light and
spits at the dirt He is tired but he can’t sleep
EXT BRADYS TRAILER - CORRAL - DAY

Brady walks towards the corral wearing his leather rodeo
jacket His eye is still bruised and he looks tired as hell

Wayne is trying a bay horse while the horse’s owner FRANK
is watching Frank is an old-school rancher cowboy with rough
skin and a hook for a hand

FRANK
He’s really moving good

BRADY
How you doing Frank

FRANK
Hey Brady how you doing

BRADY
Shit I’m healing up

Frank checks out Brady’s head

FRANK
Looks pretty wicked there

Wayne rides over He’s cocky and knows how much Brady hates
watching other people ride his horses

WAYNE
Frank This idiot for a horse
trainer you have ran away from the
hospital four days after the

surgery
FRANK

Hey Damn kid
WAYNE

Don’t listen to anything he says
He may not be thinking too good

The older cowboys laughs Brady bites his tongue
FRANK
(to Wayne)
You got him backing up pretty good

Wayne makes a kissing sound and starts backing the horse up

WAYNE
Halt baba

Wayne pulls hard The horse takes a few steps back
Brady watches intensively
BRADY
You should lay off that horse’s
face a little bit Then he wouldnt
be putting his head there like a

goose

Wayne rides around and looks at Brady patronizingly

WAYNE
You can tell me what to do when
youre riding the son-of-a-bitch
Too bad you went to the rodeo and
got all fucked up

Frank watches the father and son bickering as if he has seen
it many times

BRADY
Well I was doing what I

WAYNE
I’m doing your work here

BRADY
I was doing what I fucking needed
to do aright

WAYNE

young cowboy is riding a black bucking horse

INT BRADY’S BEDROOM - DAY
Brady is taking a nap

The door cracks open Brady’s rodeo friends CAT TANNER and
JAMES sneak in They’re a classic bunch of young Indian
cowboys donned in cowboy hats denim and flannel shirts

They bend over excitedly checking out Brady’s scar talking
in low whispers

CAT
Holy piss

TANNER
Jesus Christ He looks like
Frankenstein

CAT
It’s fuckin’ rank
JAMES
Fuck that That’s just a scratch

James takes the drag of his cigarette

JAMES (CONTD)
A little smoke will help

He leans forward and blows the smoke into Brady’s face

Brady pushes James

Get the fuck out of here

Brady rubs his eyes half smiling

CAT
You can wrap it up right

BRADY
Why What’re you guys doing

CAT

Brady nods The boys are already at the door

CAT
Last of the Mohicans

Brady laughs and sits up

EXT BADLANDS - DUSK

The epic landscape of the Badlands at dusk

Brady

The boys have built a campfire on one of the large rocks
They are laughing jumping over the fire and being rowdy

The boys race up a steep hill the half moon is bright in the

darkening sky above them

JAMES
Come on Brady

Brady sits back near the glow of the fire He watches them as

they run up to the top

Brady doesn’t follow

EXT BADLANDS - NIGHT

It’s dark now and the boys are huddled around the camp fire
sipping from beer bottles and talking about their rodeo
injuries with great pride in the flickering glow of the fire

BRADY
That horse I got on in Fargo
Everything I heard about her was
shit But got on her and said ‘fuck
it’ She was good out there for a
while until the whistle she got
real trashy and started turning
there by the fence I went over the
front of her She stepped on my
head Popped me out Didn’t knock
me out til I got to the hospital I
had a seizure and went into a coma

CAT

Broke my thumb Broke wrist twice
Broke my ankle I mean I died eight
times that’s why they call me Cat
Didn’t even cry or anything
Igmu (Lakota for “Cat”)

JAMES
Got kicked in Kadoka at Rodeo Bible
Camp Went out of the back door
That wasn’t so bad Was just kind
of a stinger for a week

TANNER

Got on this great big grey mare I
was getting pretty stretched out in
the end Thank god I heard the
whistle blow Right at the end she
slammed me down on the dirt
Hardest I ever been slammed before
Broke three ribs on my right side
Brady over there told me to get on
my short go horse even though my
ribs hurt like a son-of-a-bitch

Brady looks up at Tanner who is pretty drunk

TANNER (CONTD)
Ain’t that right Brady You don’t
let no pain put you down

(MORE )

TANNER (CONTD)

You ain’t gonna be turning out
horses left and right just because
your head hurts a little bit are
you

Cat looks at the boys thoughtfully

BRADY
I’m not I’m drawing out of
anything I’m just taking some time
off Your brain is a little
different than yo ur ribs

TANNER
Yah I know It’s all the same to a
cowboy Ride through the pain

Brady keeps quiet but his jaws are tense

TANNER (CONTD)
Now don’t let this head injury go
to your head Get you scared I
know how that goes with some guys
They get scared to get on again
and they end up becoming farmers

CAT
Hey Brady

Cat interrupts the conversation and turns to Brady

CAT (CONTD)
You seen Lane lately

BRADY
I didn’t get a chance to see him
there for a while while I was
rodeoing But they just checked him
into a brand new rehab facility

Cat looks back at the fire lost in a thought

Tanner wipes his face looks restless after the mention of
Lane

BRADY (CONTD)
He probably could’ve won the world
if he’d had an honest chance He
was a damn good bull rider

Tanner stuffs tobacco chew into his lip

TANNER
Remember when he went three for
three in McCool Junction And won
it

Brady smiles and nods

BRADY
That was a good night for Lane
You remember when he switched hands
at Elkhorn and won the bull riding
first time ever riding a bull with
his right hand Eighty four points

JAMES
Shit one time me and Lane was
coming back from a party We was
driving in Tanner’s brother’s car
and we was kind of talking about
women We was a little drunk and
Lane looks over at me and says
‘James you know what one thing
I’ve learned in life is’ he says
‘girls they come in with a name
and they leave with a number’

James and the other boys laugh

JAMES (CONTD)
Kind of fucked up but

CAT
Dirty dog

JAMES
Yep Lane

The laughter fades and the boys become sombre Cat looks back
at the fire

CAT
Real wild Real good guy too

Brady looks over at Cat

CAT (CONTD)
I want to say a prayer for him I
mean it would be best if we said a
prayer every day you know the guy
sure could use it But I want to go
ahead and just say

Brady pulls his hood back Tanner and James remove their
hats They bow their heads in prayer

CAT (CONT’D)
I pray to God that he takes in all
the strength from all his friends
across the nation North south
east and west ‘cause over this
country

Cat has a thoughtful smile on his face

CAT (CONTD)
I hope he gets to ride again Feel
the wind in his back watch it flow
through the grass Be what he wants
to be once again

Brady listens His jaw tightens

CAT (CONTD)
We are him and he is us We’re all
one in this together Mitakuye
Oyasin

Brady crosses himself Tanner and James put their hats back
on and take swigs from their beer bottles

Cat picks up his guitar and starts strumming the chords of a
country song he wrote called “Gambling Man” about the life of
a rodeo cowboy It used to be Brady’s favorite now it’s
bittersweet for him to listen to

Brady stares into the fire watching the eerie blue flames
curl around the glowing embers

EXT PRAIRIEBADLANDS - DAWN

Music plays as time passes Moments of silence on the Great
Plains A Badlands sunrise Withering sunflowers in a field
of dry grass Windmills Horses at dusk

Brady wanders in the Badlands while a thunderstorm is brewing
in the distance coloring the sky an unusual blend of yellow
and green

A significant amount of time has passed since the boys prayed
for their friend around the bonfire Brady’s hair has grown
back covering up his scar He looks thin and pale He
watches the distance lightening

He walks over to Lane’s chair The room is sparse with a
small bed in the corner a white support pole beside it
leading into the ceiling The walls are covered in old
pictures of Lane in his younger years as an up-and-coming
bull rider

Lane can not speak His bull riding accident has left him
permanently paralyzed He’s barely able to lift his left
hand using sign language to communicate

Brady gives Lane a hug helping him to put his arm around
him

BRADY (CONTD)

Lane slowly closes his eyes as they embrace
Brady pulls back after a moment
BRADY (CONT’D)

good Best bull rider coming out of

Brady smiles and looks up at Lane Lane smiles back His face
is a lot thinner now than the young vibrant man in the
video His facial muscle has been damaged by the paralysis
altering his looks But Lane is smiling He enjoys revisiting
these moments

The video starts to show Lane’s wild bull rides chasing
after buffaloes being a goofy teenager

Lane stands in front of camera wearing a cowboy hat and
striped shirt

LANE (VIDEO) (CONT’D)
I was about three years old when my
dad introduced me to the rodeo
world There is nothing can really
beat it You get on a bull Makes a
good ride Everybody in the stands
stand up for you yells and cheers
Your adrenaline is goin’ You just
can’t stop but smiling

Lane in his wheelchair eyes bright grinning happily He
has not lost his spirit

LANE (VIDEO) (CONTD)
There is nothing like strapping
yourself on a 2000 pound animal and
just going with it That’s what I
want to do and I want to do it for
the rest of my life I can’t
imagine doing anything else

Brady’s smiles slowly fades

Brady is riding Apollo across the plains The purplish
Badlands passing them as he gallops

EXT BILL’S CORRAL - EVENING
Music continues -

Brady trains Bill’s horse - a brown Arabian colt that’s never
been rode before Bill is the silver-haired cowboy who asked
him for help at the bar

The young horse runs around the corral avoiding Brady and
Bill at first slipping falling to the ground getting up
runs again panting agitated

Brady is calm Like a fish to water Brady seems to
understand every movement of the horse as if they are locked
in some kind of telepathic dance routine

Bill is speechless when Brady manages to get on the colt
bareback in no time

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - TIME PASSING

good old horse back in 60s or so
Wish he was buckskin

Every body gets color blind in the

The harvest moon is bright in the sky The edge of the
Badlands is visible in the dark

Brady walks around by himself

Music ends End of time pass montage

EXT BRADY’S CORRAL - MORNING
Brady rides hard galloping across the prairie

He slows down puling on the reins as the sun glares down
above him

He rubs his brow suddenly feeling faint He lurches forward
and vomits He loses control jumping from Apollo and
staggering before falling collapses onto the ground

INT HOSPITAL - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

Brady sits opposite the DOCTOR at her desk Wayne sitting on
a chair in the corner The doctor shows him the x-rays
highlighting the severity of his injury Wayne sits by Brady
slouched in a chair

DOCTOR
What’s going on with your hand is
called a partial complex seizure
It’s not uncommon with head
injuries like yours

Brady wipes his forehead Wayne shifts in his seat

DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Your brain is sending these
impulses so fast to your hand that
your hand cant keep up This could
explain your dizziness and it’s
probably why you fainted

Brady looks down

DOCTOR (CONTD)
Resting is very important Brady
Your Dad says you haven’t been
resting at all Is that right

WAYNE
I told him to rest He never
listens though It’s lucky he
didn’t hurt his head

DOCTOR
If you don’t stop your seizures are
going to get worse No more riding
no more rodeos You cant afford
another head injury on top of the
one you already have OK

Brady leans back in his chair Dejected

IE PICK-UP ON HIGHWAY - EVENING
Wayne is driving He looks over at Brady

WAYNE
Well Brady sometimes we gotta
play the cards we’re dealt
Sometimes I guess dreams
aren’t meant to be

Brady stays quiet
Wayne looks over at him again
WAYNE (CONTD)
You know I’m your dad You can
talk to me
Brady continues to keep quiet

Brady stares at the disappearing lights outside the window
His face expressionless
EXT DAKOTA MART - DUSK
Brady stands alone outside the store The sun has set and
people are climbing into their cars to head home He spits

chew into an empty soda bottle and looks up

He notices a young man riding a horse on the side of the
highway towards the parking lot

JOHNNY a young Lakota teenager climbs from the horse and
ties him to a pole

He walks passed Brady and they nod to each other in
acknowledgement before Johnny goes into the store
Brady walks towards the horse He lets the horse smell his
hand and pets him The horse seems out of place in this

urban environment of traffic and concrete

Brady sighs

EXT BRADYS TRAILER - THE NEXT DAY

BRADY
Stay back in your saddle

Brady is training James to ride saddle bronc on a tall
training barrel that moves like a bucking horse while Cat
operates it with a lever handle

Brady is holding the rope and shows James how to keep equal
pressure how to squeeze the swells

BRADY (CONT’D)
Youre gonna kick See how that
works Keep the slack out of your
rein

Brady and Jamess hand grip the rope as the large barrel
creeks back and forth

BRADY (CONTD)
Ready No slack Pressure Where’s
the pressure

James his face flushed and dotted with sweat leans back
his arm in the air rock back and forth in an imaginary ride

BRADY (CONTD)
Like that Perfect Just like that

JAMES
So after that I throw my shoulder
back

BRADY

Yes to get rid of the slack in
your rein then up in the air and to
your left

The younger James dotes on his every word Acting out the
action as Brady speaks

Cat lifts the lever handle as James ricks back and forth
throwing his legs forward blowing air from his cheeks as
Brady gives instructions

BRADY (CONT’D)
Ride like it’s gonna be the last
horse you ever get on Because any
bronc could be the last one

EXT BRADYS TRAILER - LATER
Brady climbs up onto the training barrel

CAT
Big ol’ shaggy bronc

Brady laughs as he arranges the rope

BRADY
Ok I’m gonna feel the jump Go
ahead

Cat pulls the lever as Brady finds the right length for his
rope He’s satisfied and gives Cat the nod to start pushing
Brady rocks back and forth kicking his legs out and turning
his rigid body in synchronization with the rocking of the
barrel He’s serious and focused

BRADY (CONTD)
See how I go back and across

Cat smiles as he pushes down on the lever Its good to see
Brady up there again even if only on a practice barrel
CAT
Lift

BRADY

See Give him some rein Hold hima

second then beat him back to the
ground Fast feet

CAT
Be like water my friend

The intensity on Brady’s face lifts for a second He’s

already out of breath He leans forward

BRADY
James you wanna try

As Brady leans forward he finds he can’t let
His hand is gripping around the rope tightly
control it Trying hard not to make anything
of the other boys he struggles to peel open

CAT
You aright

BRADY
Yes I’m fine

Brady pulls his hand free and lowers himself

INT BRADY’S TRAILER - LIVING ROOM - DAY

to the ground

A rodeo blares from the large TV in the corner of the room

Brady holds a yellow cowboy shirt He’s giving James his old
rodeo gear since the young cowboy is just starting out

BRADY
This is Lane Scott’s old riding
shirt He won about 15 thousand

dollars in one summer wearing this

shirt It was mine for a while I
probably had my best summer in it
If it fits you you can have it

too Too short in the arms for me

Brady hands James the shirt and sits down next to Cat

JAMES
Damn
CAT
Some cowboys believe yellow is
superstitious That ones lucky
though ha

Brady smiles

BRADY
That one must just be ‘stitious’

They smile and watch James as he tries on the shirt

BRADY (CONT’D)
Don’t make it look bad

James fastens the buttons and holds out his arms

JAMES
I like it

BRADY
You can try those chaps on too If
they fit go ahead and take them

He watches James trying on his chaps and spurs Like a

superhero seeing someone else wearing his cape

JAMES
They fit perfect Thanks Brades
Appreciate it

BRADY
Yep

JAMES
I can’t wait to ride in these bad
boys

James motions the action of being on a bucking horse He’s

trying to seem manly but it doesn’t come off

Brady watches James for another moment James notices his

stare and quickly looks away

BRADY

James do you still wrestle
JAMES

Huh
BRADY

Do you still wrestle

JAMES
Sometimes Haven’t practiced in a
while though

CAT
I’m down for a match or two

BRADY
Come on Let’s wrestle then

James looks confused

Cat smirks although he too seems unsure if Brady is serious

JAMES
Why

BRADY
Why not We used to practice
together

JAMES
Yah Well that was tenth
grade

CAT

Been a long day Shake it up a bit
Brady looks determined James gives in

JAMES
Aright Ok

Brady and James shake hands The boys start to circle around
each other Very soon James has a smile on his face too

They go at each other wrestling as hard as they can Clearly
both of them have some training in the past

It looks like an even match for a while James even seems to
have an upper hand

Then suddenly Brady takes it seriously He grabs onto James
and puts him in a choke hold flips him over his shoulder and
pins him onto the ground

James struggles to get out of Brady’s hold His legs kicking
out But Brady holds him tight too tight James struggles
to breathe

JAMES (CONTD)
Aright I’m good Brady I’m
pinned

James is clearly in pain But Brady doesn’t let him go
keeping him in the choke hold

JAMES (CONT’D)
Ok Brady

CAT
Aright aright

Cat pulls Brady away from James

JAMES
Fuck Brady

Now getting some air in his lungs James gets up quickly

CAT
You aright

Brady immediately feels guilty

BRADY
Didn’t hurt you did I

JAMES

Told you I was pinned Told you I
was done What’s the matter with

you

CAT
Cowboy up partner

James shakes his head and walks away
Cat walks into the kitchen leaving Brady alone

Brady wipes his face steadies his breath He looks up at the
TV - the screen shows the replay of a cowboy riding bucking
horse in slow motion

EXT CAT’S TRAILER - NIGHT

A moth rest on the florescent light The sound of a tattoo
gun buzzing

Cat is finishing up the tattoo of Lane on Brady’s back

BRADY
You don’t think I was too hard on
James do you

CAT
Nah He is aright

The room falls silent again

Cat looks at Brady for a moment while wiping blood off of
his fresh tattoo

CAT (CONTD)
You know I know about your hand I
know you ain’t supposed to be
rodeoing or anything like that

Brady doesn’t react Cat starts tattooing again
CAT (CONT’D)
Must be tough I know it’s tough
But You just gotta learn to let
it go and move on

Cat stops his tattoo gun and looks up at Brady

CAT (CONTD)
Or it will eat at ya

Bradys jaw is tense He stays quiet
CAT (CONTD)
It’s gotta be tough I mean I

BRADY
No You don’t understand

Cat stops looks at Brady waiting for him to say something
else But Brady is silent

Brady laughs

BRADY (CONT’D)

BRADY (CONTD)

call huh

Lane sighs with a thumb up grinning

Brady is helping Lane to change out of his t-shirt into a
cowboy shirt

Lane’s body is thin and frail from the lack of movement On
his back there is a large tattoo that reads “Say I wont”

Brady helps him to put the shirt on one sleeve at a time
wiping drool off of his mouth There is a large tattoo
covering the whole side of Lane’s body - the late legendary
bull rider Lane Frost riding a bucking bull Next to the
tattoo a gastrostomy tube is inserted into Lane’s flesh

Brady bottoms up Lane’s shirt Lane looks up at him

BRADY (CONT’D)
Looking good stud muffin

Lane smiles

INT REHABILITATION CENTER - TRAINING ROOM

Four PHYSIOTHERAPISTS help Lane to get on a practice saddle -
a saddle strapped on a wooden platform with reins attached in
the front

Lane’s shaking hand reaches for the horn of the saddle Brady
quickly takes his hand and places it onto the horn and holds
onto Lane’s hand so it doesn’t slip off

It’s a difficult process but Lane eventually sits onto the
saddle He looks up at Brady with a big grin on his face

Brady takes Lane’s cowboy hat and puts it onto Lane’s head

BRADY
Don’t wanna get a sunburn

Lane starts to move his body back and forth as if he is ona
galloping horse holding the reins in each hand while Brady
holds the other two ends of the rein standing in front of
Lane Lane has trouble keeping his head up

BRADY (CONTD)
Look up at me brother Look up at
me Lane

Lane slowly rise his head Shaking his body faster as if he
is riding fast

Brady starts laughing with Lane out of pure joy at seeing his
friends spirits so high

BRADY (CONT’D)
Halt boy Now slow him down a
little bit Back him up

Lane stops shaking and slowly pulling the reins back

BRADY (CONTD)
Now sit up straight Let’s do some
loping Go fast

Lane starts to shake his body again They both start
laughing

BRADY (CONT’D)
Really loping off to the distance

Lane makes a low sound through his damaged vocal cords

BRADY (CONT’D)
Good job Now you better watch out
She may start bucking Keep a good
tight seat on there You better
lift up your rein

Lane struggles to keep his head up

BRADY (CONTD)
Lift lift lift

Lane’s head sinks lower

BRADY (CONTD)
You got her pull up now

Suddenly Brady stops smiling a wave of sadness hits him He
looks down takes a deep breath and looks up at Lane whose
head is still down

Brady straightens his body his face firm
BRADY (CONT’D)
Look up Lane Look up at me

brother Pick your head up Way up

Lane struggles painfully but lifts his head up slowly with a
proud smile on his face

BRADY (CONT’D)
There you go Lane Good work You

Brady says goodbye to Lane They do their usual complicated
hand shake Brady helps Lane with his hand Then he lifts
Lane’s arm up so they can give each other a hug

They hug for a moment

BRADY (CONT’D)

good seeing you

Lane gives Brady the thumb up

BRADY (CONT’D)

INT BRADY’S TRUCK - DAY

Brady drives for a while in silence Loud wind blowing
outside the window

He tries to hold back but can’t Tears roll down his face He
quickly pulls over and breaks down sobbing

INT BRADY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Brady puts his hat on the wall Takes off his shirt and
starts cleaning the room He notices his rodeo bag in the
corner gathering dust

He pulls his chaps and riding rope out of the bag Holding
the black and white rope tightly in his hand stretching out
in front of him as if he is riding a bronc horse Then
slowly he stops and puts the rope down

Brady sits at the edge of the bed and cleans his pistol He
sits back in bed and draws the pistol as if he was in an old
western movie aiming the gun at himself in the closet
mirror The broken mirror distorts Brady’s face fracturing
it as he rubs his throbbing brow Lilly’s paper stars dot
the wall behind him like bullet holes

EXT PRAIRIE - DAY

Brady walks around It’s windy He whistles and calls out for
Apollo

He grows impatient His whistle louder But there is still no
sign of Apollo in the wide open plains

Brady keeps walking He stops when he notices something -

A broken fence The barbwire is broken and tangled

Brady quickly runs over Blood and flesh scatter the ground
Brady finds Apollo

The barbed wire has badly cut through his joint like a
hacksaw Apollo is breathing harshly

Brady looks at the deep bone cutting wound His heart sinks

He tries to get Apollo to walk but the injured horse trips
and cries out loudly neighing panting

Brady knows what needs to be done He sits down for a moment
Looks at Apollo for a long time

BRADY
I’m sorry buddy Should’ve stayed
close to home

Brady takes his pistol out of the gun holder He stands up
takes a deep breath toughens up and points it at Apollo

Suddenly Apollo shakes his head panicked neighing whining
as if he understood what Brady is about to do

The last bit of toughness in Brady is gone He can’t do it
He uncocks the pistol

EXT PRAIRIE - DUSK

The sun has disappeared behind the Badlands

Wayne checks the bullets in the pistol and takes the rein
from Brady

WAYNE
Whistle for him when you walk away
please

Brady walks away from them

Wayne points the gun at Apollo unmoved He has done this
Many times

Brady stops He is facing away from Wayne and Apollo He
waits for a moment The wind picks up

He whistles

BANG A loud gun shot immediately follows echoing out over
the hills

Brady steadies his breath staying tough He spits and walks
away Behind him Wayne takes his hat off as he looks down at
Apollos lifeless body

Didn’t you always say “be a man
Brady Fucking step up get back

Wayne doesn’t look at Brady His stern face now has a hint of
sadness

WAYNE
Well not today

He tries to take Brady’s bronc saddle from the truck

WAYNE (CONT’D)
You don’t need to fucking go

BRADY
Bull shit I’m fucking riding

Brady grabs the saddle to keep it in place

WAYNE
Fine

Wayne lets go of the saddle

WAYNE (CONTD)
Go kill yourself then

He walks away

BRADY
Look at you now What’re you good

Brady watches Wayne walking back to the trailer

BRADY
I’m not gonna end up like you

Wayne stops for a moment but there’s nothing to say

Brady quickly gets into the truck and drives away

EXT BRADY’S TRUCK ON HIGHWAY

Brady’s truck is seen from a distance A tiny vehicle
barreling through the endless badlands

INT PICK-UP ON HIGHWAY

Brady’s eyes are fixed on the road He looks down at the
passenger seat and notices something - Lilly’s recorder

He picks it up and presses play Lilly’s cheerful voice
rattles out of it As always Lilly’s words are unique only
to her but Brady finds comfort in hearing her voice He
cant help but smile

LILLY
I know it’s your train Elmo but I
only played a little minute I’1l
give it back I promise And you
know what This is amazing Good

The recorder goes dead

Brady’s smile drops and his eyes focus on the road

EXT WATERS RODEO - DAY

Brady walks into the rodeo with his saddle and gear across
his back

He is reunited with the boys Moving passed Tanner and James
shaking hands as he goes Everyone is happy to see him

JAMES
Hey Brady

TANNER
Hey Brady What you doing here

Brady forces a smile

He takes a spot by the fence and starts to puts on his chaps
and spurs

He looks over to see Cat giving him a look as he too gets
ready to ride

The rodeo is in full swing A bareback rider leaps from the
gate and is immediately bucked off his horse in a cloud of
dust The crowd gasps and cheers as he hits the ground hard

Brady puts on his spurs and prepares his saddle He keeps
shaking his right hand

He sits on the saddle on the ground and puts chalk onto the
grip ANOTHER RIDER approaches him They shake hands

RIDER
Good to see you back Brady

BRADY
Yah you too

Brady goes back to his saddle and immediately grabs his head
rubbing his temple He’s in pain and it shows

Brady goes behind the chute to get his horse ready The wild
bucking horse begins to go berserk in the Chute Leaping up
trying to get free The riders try to hold it down as it
kicks and struggles against the metal bars You have to be
either brave or stupid to get on an animal like that Brady
seems determined to be both

The horse falls to the ground and Brady lowers his body down
dangerously into the chute to pull the horse back to its
feet The Horse stands and smashes once again against the
bars before finally calming down

Brady stops for a moment watching another ride He looks
around and something catches his eye

Wayne and Lilly are in the audience standing by the fence
Lilly sees Brady and waves

Brady is surprised to see them He holds back his emotions
and forces a smile

Wayne nods at Brady acknowledging his son Letting him know
that his family have come to support him

Brady nods back but quickly walks away jumping from the
chute and tries to focus doing his stretches going through
his routine The bright sun glares behind him

Brady is pacing back and forth He is breathing hard He
looks down at his hand and realizes that once again it’s
gripping on its own so tight his knuckles are pale He
tries to peel open his hand but it doesn’t work

He struggles to let go

Brady thinks for a moment then he steadies his breath and
slowly closes his eyes

The sound of the crowd starts to fade around Brady He is not
struggling anymore he just stands there

Then -

His hand still trembles but his fingers slowly open up on
their own and let go

The heavy rope drops onto the ground

Brady opens his eyes Almost surprised as he looks down at
his open palm

The boys are calling out to him now It’s his turn to ride
But Brady doesn’t move

Cat jumps off the chute to check on him

CAT
You aright

Brady looks at his relaxed hand and up at Cat

BRADY
Yah

CAT
Come on then

Brady doesn’t move They look at each other for a moment

BRADY
Good luck partner

Brady reaches his hand out Cat looks at him thoughtfully
Then he reaches out to shake Brady’s hand in a moment of
quiet understanding and respect

CAT
You too Cowboy

Brady turns and walks away

Music plays -

The beautiful moments of the rodeo at dusk Young riders
risking it all in the arena Their friends cheering them on
