THE HUMANS - Karam 1

WHITE 1
The slow intrusion of a cloud reveals we’re staring at a

BRIGHT NOVEMBER SKY

EXT CHINATOWN AIR SHAFT - DAY 2

Same piece of sky carved into a geometric shape by DARKNESS
We are at the bottom of a dark air shaft looking up

OPENING CREDITS over

SKY SHAPES seen from the same angle--each unique each
carved by turn-of-the-century tenements

A FINAL SKY SHAPE We seem to be near the bottom of the
shaft yet we sink further DOWN DOWN arriving at a BARRED
GROUND-FLOOR WINDOW Inside A MAN looks out This is ERIK
BLAKE blue collar

INT DUPLEX APARTMENT UPSTAIRS MAIN ROOM - DAY 3

Erik alone peers through the dirty glass He searches for
some sun No luck He clutches plastic bags his coat still
on Indirect light from the air shaft filters into the room
a bit ghostly

A THUD from above the ceiling startles him He looks up

ERIK
What the hell was that

A PRE-WAR LIGHT FIXTURE VIBRATES settles Erik look back
down then up again wary No noise Eventually he starts to
walk away when--another THUD He looks up again

Erik surveys the room The PRE-WAR WALLS are slathered with
OFF-WHITE PAINT--so is the

--old cable wire snaking along the molding
--radiator
--ceiling fan

all curiously monotone On the wall a BUBBLED WATER STAIN
leading away from the THICKLY PAINTED WINDOW MOLDING He
follows the water stain to a spiral staircase leading down
Before he can peer down--laughter radiates from the hallway

AIMEE BLAKE and BRIGID BLAKE arrive hold up 48
rolls of toilet paper look to Erik smiling

youre biggest threat is what--getting
killed by some enterprising human right

DEIRDRE

BRIGID
Theyd be more scared by monster-eating-
monsters or something am I right

ERIK
Monsters aren’t real so it’s a weird
thing to wanna be right about

RICHARD BRIGID (CONTD)
I’m not embarrassed-- --it’s actually great--she
didn’t want him spoiled so
he doesn’t see any of the
money until he’s 40

ERIK
You haven’t reached that milestone
yet Rich
BRIGID RICHARD
Ha ha No not quite I’m 35
DEIRDRE

Having to wait until your forties is a--
your grandma’s a smart lady it’s like
that--’member that email I forwarded you
guys about Andrew Carnegie--is it
Carnegie or Carnegie I never remember--

RICHARD ERIK
Pretty sure Carnegie is Carnegie Hall right

corr--oh maybe yeah Carnegie Hall
THE HUMANS - Karam 70

DEIRDRE
I forwarded it Rich ‘cause it had this
great answer to the question “What makes
Americans powerful and influential and
wealthy”

Small beat as they eat

AIMEE
Trust funds

DEIRDRE
Nonot trust funds smart-ass

AIMEE
What--too soon Too soon

BRIGID
Uh--yes too soon

DEIRDRE

What makes a person powerful and
influential and wealthy is not growing up
with power and influence and wealth
That’s what the e-mail said anyway

(emotions catch her off guard)
the gift of poverty is ait’s not a
myth it’s a real thing it can be a
blessing

AIMEE
Whoa Mom are you okay

DEIRDRE
Yeah just happy to be with my girls

ish light Not flattering Deirdre sees herself in the
toilet water the colored Christmas lights swim around her

ERIK (PRE-LAP)

One thing I learned Rich--and the older
I get I see this--it’s that having too
much money--it can be just as bad for you

--you know Gotta be Dad why’re you--what are

CRACK of another beer opening Deirdre descends the stairs

RICHARD
I think I get what you’re--do you mean--

ERIK
I’m saying--Dee’s bosses have more money
than God and they’re stingy with her on
everything bonuses vacation days so--
and this isn’t some scientific notion or
something--but yeah I do notice that
rich people are usually pretty messed up

BRIGID AIMEE

Oh my God That’s an elegant thesis

Of course

RICHARD
Well no no it’s a good point I just
don’t think being messed up is
necessarily linked to how much money is
in your bank account

BRIGID ERIK

oe Yeah but it can shift your
priorities in ways that
aren’t good

RICHARD
We agree on that yeah but so can
being poor Right Just meaning--

BRIGID
Yes

AIMEE
Everyone’s right guys

Deirdre re-joins the table

RICHARD
--I actually agree with you I’m just
adding thatyes wealth can ruin
people but so can poverty
THE HUMANS - Karam 72

DEIRDRE
Well I’d rather be ruined in a Four
Seasons somewhere on a beach you
knowI’11l take wealth for four-

BRIGID

RICHARD
-I hear you I’m just proud that my
family went out of their way to ensure--
you do get that I’m not able to touch my
money until I’m 40 right

letter on her phone

THE HUMANS - Karam 77

AIMEE
What’s it say

BRIGID
--at least now I know why I’m not even
getting interviews for unpaid
internships

ERIK
(reading)
What--he didn’t praise you enough

Pissed Brigid grabs her phone

BRIGID

Are you kidding me

(reading)
“Brigid is a talented musician and
composer she served as a TA in my music
theory class her senior year and many of
the students noted how approachable and
helpful she was to them in navigating the
course Initially I must confess I
found Brigid’s compositions almost
willfully opposed to specificity and
urgency In her senior year however she
showed marked improvement And while her
orchestral pieces still do not have the
range or originality of her
contemporaries she always displays
technical proficiency and great verve Her
hard work and positive attitude have made
her an asset to the music department”

(eyes watering)
--why wouldn’t he respect me enough to
say he couldn’t do it

ERIK
You can always work retail
DEIRDRE AIMEE
Don’t tease her-- Dad--

the lantern turns it onthe vibrating stops LED lantern
in hand Erik goes to the fuse box He tries the switches
to no avail He tries them again when--VIBRATING again

slightly as it vibrates Vibrates His heart races as he

OPEN and reflects his lantern stopping him for a moment He
continues downstairs--

breath quickens as he moves DOWN THE DARK HALLWAY towards
the THE BASEMENT DOOR He throws it open fluorescent light
floods in--the rumble of the trash compactor is now even
louder but more familiar more like a loud trash compactor

The trash compactor completes its cycle Silence
Erik comes back inside but the spring-hinged door doesnt

stay open it slams shut plunging the room into darkness
It scares him he drops the lantern

Erik gropes for something to hold the door open grabs a
paint can holding the anteroom door open uses it to prop
open the basement door

Fluorescent hallway light spills into the space again via
the basement door Erik’s propping it open with a chair

Erik grasps for the dropped lantern which has remained on
holds it up and for a second WE ARE JOLTED by what might be

A DARK OUTLINE OF A WOMAN--which quickly reveals itself to
be THE OUTLINE OF BRIGID’S COAT hanging on the wall

Erik sweats--what is happening to me--He swings the lantern
around and catches a brief glimpse of what might be a FACE
PUSHING THROUGH THE WHITE WALL quickly revealed to be the
bubbling water stain as--from the depths of the hallway--

-click-clack click-clack click-clack
Erik backs away from the hallway entrance
click-clack click-clack click-clack
Erik’s heart pounds he looks towards the door
Cclick-CLACK click-CLACK click-CLACK

In a breath AN ELDERLY CHINESE WOMAN passes the basement
door on her way down the hall wheeling her laundry in a
cheap metal cart with a busted wheel The sounds slowly
disappears as she rolls the cart down the hall

This ordinary event overwhelms Erik triggers a few ugly
sobs His face half-visible via the lantern He sits
quietly terrified sweating mumbling the Hail Mary Is he
recovering from a panic attack

ERIK
What’s happening to meoh God

SLOW PULL BACK around 25 seconds--almost imperceptible
until we glean how small Erik is alone surrounded by huge
darkness Then in the growing darkness above Erik--

hallway SHUTS the upstairs
door leaving--

Erik in the epic dark He goes to leave but realizes THE
LED LANTERN IS STILL ON Erik turns off the lantern The
shaft of hallway light has a tunnel-like quality Floating
dust particles are visible Imperceptibly the dark around
Erik slowly saturates from the darkness of a room without
light to a black that voids any sense of architecture Erik
exits down the hallway Is the hallway a bit longer than
before A long beat

The faint ding of the elevator from deep in the hallway The
sound of the elevator doors opening and closing The sound
of the elevator motor going up A very long beat

The propped-open door begins to close entirely on its own
the weight of the chair can no longer hold it open

The door slowly creaks shut leaving us in a deep true
BLACK
