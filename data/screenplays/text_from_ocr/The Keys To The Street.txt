TITLES OVER

BLACK SCREEN Accompanied by a RHYTHMIC ORGANIC PULSE

FADE IN

On a MICROSCOPIC VIEW of a blood stream Translucent artery
walls Channels branching off from one another Cells SURGE
forward then CREEP back in a regular hypnotic rhythn

The TITLES and PULSING SOUND continue over

EXT REGENTS PARK -- MORNING

Another kind of circulatory system Paths Walks Bridges
Here the ebb and surge is more chaotic CHILDREN on
rollerblades COUPLES strolling LONELY MEN dragging their
worlds along in plastic bags as

INT OPERATING ROOM -- DAY

A SERIES of EXTREME CLOSE-UPS pulse past HUMAN SKIN wiped
by a cotton swab Latex-covered HANDS A gleaming large-
bore NEEDLE with an oblique serrated edge

The tip of the needle is placed against a WOMANS naked hip
and we are back to

EXT REGENTS PARK -- MORNING

A dog walker marches along a path with a formation of six
purebreds BEAN is seventy but looks younger His faux
military manner is undermined by the bright red cap he wears
INT OPERATING ROOM -- DAY

The needle PENETRATES the womans skin Stops when it hits
bone Force is applied The syringe JUMPS FORWARD as bone
is breached with an AUDIBLE CRACK

EXT PRIMROSE BRIDGE -- MORNING

Bean and his squad of dogs start across the bridge TILT
DOWN to the darkness beneath where a man in a grime-clotted
jacket squats HOB has one boot and sock off and a cord
cinched tight around his ankle He uses a syringe to inject
heroin into a vein in his foot

INT OPERATING ROOM -- DAY

FOAMY BLOOD is drawn into the syringe The PULSING SOUND
fades fades

smile and bestows it upon

beauty with an earnest manner She drops to one knee and
scoops up the smallest dog in Beans litter an ugly little
ornament of a shih tzu named GUSHI

BEAN
The dogs benefit from the discipline
Miss Its one of the tricks you

Awkward pause Bean glares

BEAN
No theyre not

She suppresses a smile Strives to look properly chastened
INT TERRACE HOUSE - FRONT HALL -- MORNING

Mary slips back inside and closes the door She puts down
Gushi who scrabbles away through the oak-panelled gloon

The interior of the house is rich and stately and filled
with echoes

Mary sorts through the mail She finds a letter addressed
to her that bears no stamp or postmark Curious she opens
it and unfolds a short note

A SMALL PHOTOGRAPH falls out Mary bends to retrieve it as
she reads the FIRST LINE of the note

TQ MARY JAGO THE WOMAN WHO SAVED MY LIFE

Mary utters a tiny gasp of delight and relief She turns to
the photo a shot of a thin young blonde man with a lit-up
smile His image has been cut from a larger picture There
is someones arm around his shoulder

Marys eyes drink in the young man’s face

EXT PARK CRESCENT -- AFTERNOON

Mary steps out and starts off down the street oblivious to
the CAR parked at the opposite end

Alistair sits behind the wheel watching her walk away from
him He looks suspicious When a homeless man begins to
clean his windshield he flares

ALISTAIR
Hey bugger off

Its the man we watched shooting heroin under the bridge
Hob He glares at Alistair who prudently rolls up his window

The RHYTHMIC ORGANIC PULSE from the title sequence begins
again as

EXT PRIMROSE HILL BRIDGE -- EVENING

We see Mary hurrying across the bridge She checks her watch
and increases her speed
EXT REGENTS PARK -- EVENING
Mary is running now The PULSE has accelerated with her
EXT REGENTS PARK CAFE - PATIO -- EVENING

Mary stops in the porch out of breath from her run The
PULSE is pounding in time with her heart Drowning out all
other sounds

She spots the man from the photo sitting at a table LEO
NASH is in his mid-twenties and paper-pale with a gently
mocking smile and warm eyes He seems to swim inside a
comfortably battered leather jacket

The PULSING stops Mary fights to catch her breath

And Leo suddenly turn Sees her standing there His face
lights up as he raises his eyebrows in friendly enquiry
Mary breaks into a big embarrassed smile He rises as she
makes her way toward hin

LEO
Mary Im Leo Leo Nash

There is an awkward moment they fill with a handshake With
their pale colouring they look like they could be related

MARY
Im sorry Im late I had to run I
thought you might have gone

LEO
No Please sit down

He pulls a chair out for her Remains standing

LEO (CONTD)
What can I get you Cup of tea

MARY
Yes please

LEO

MARY
No thanks

LEO

Well if I get one for myself what
sort do you think I should get

( )

MARY
I wouldnt know Really

He starts toward the cafe Mary watches him then calls out

MARY (CONTD)
Chocolate

Leo glances back over his shoulder with a grin Mary settles
back against her seat

And then she catches sight of a familiar red cap outside the
enclosure Bean is walking past with a bag of take-out food
He pauses to watch Leo then looks to her He gives her a
thin smile and continues on

EXTREME CLOSE-UP A HALF-EATEN CHOCOLATE CAKE AND TWO FORKS
Mary watches fascinated as Leo eats He looks embarrassed
LEO
The doctors told me to eat I think
they meant stuff like fruits and
vegetables though But I feel good
Thanks to you

Mary smiles pleased

MARY
Can I ask you-
LEO
Anything
MARY
T want to know about it
LEO
It
MARY

Your illness
LEO

I never really thought of it as mine
MARY

All these months Ive been so
worried about you

LEO
You didnt even know who I was

( )

MARY
Of course I did in a way I knew
you were in trouble Besides not
really knowing you--

LEO
Let you imagine me to be whoever you
wanted I know I did the same with
you I hope Im not a disappointment

Mary blushes

MARY
Of course not Youre here Youre
healthy

LEO
I am

MARY

Still can you tell me about it

She looks at him expectantly Leo seems uncomfortable but

eager not to disappoint He sits back arms folded

LEO
Well Id just finished university
when I started getting pains in my
side It got worse A lot worse I
Started having terrible nosebleeds
and bruising easily I was diagnosed
with Acute Myeloid Leukemia

Mary listens raptly Lee sounds matter-of-fact but he
tightens his arms about himself as he goes on

LEO (CONTD)
The doctors told me my only chance
was a bone marrow transplant They
tested my brother Carl for a tissue
match but he wasnt suitable We
couldnt find anyone else

MARY
That must have been terrifying

LEO
Terrifying and maddening Living
in a city this crowded you know--
Statistically you know--that theres
someone who has the cure you need
living close by

He gestures to the people around with short jabs

( )
17

LEO (CONTD)
They could be at the next table or
walking past you every day but youve
no way of of

MARY
Connecting

LEO
Yes Connecting Yes exactly

He takes a deep breath Finds a smile

LEO (CONTD)
It was my brother Carl who knew thered
be a way Carl was amazing Through
the hospital he found out about the
Harvest Trust And the Harvest Trust
found you

He fixes her with a direct look

LEO (CONTD)
And you saved me

MARY
All I did was offer to be tested

LEO
Why did you

Mary seems surprised by the question Leo smiles

LEO (CONTD)
You dont wake up one morning and
just volunteer to donate bone marrow
er do you

MARY
The Harvest Trust is one of my
Grandmothers charities She knew
how badly they needed donors It
just seemed like a good thing A
small thing really

LEO
Not to me I wouldnt be here if--

MARY
Some people thought I was foolish

LEO
Who

( )

MARY
My boyfriend

She winces at the sudden stab of memory
FLASH COT
INT ALISTAIRS FLAT BEDROOM - FLASHBACK -- NIGHT

CLOSE on a mans HAND sliding over a womans naked hip It
touches a BANDAGE fastened there Then

EXT REGENTS PARK CAFE - PATIO -- EVENING
Mary shrugs to dispel the image in her mind

MARY
He thought the operation was a risk
He told me I wasnt strong enough

LEQ
Maybe he was jealous that you were
helping a stranger

Mary nods

MARY
He hated the idea of someone else
having even a little part of me The
thought that you and I were somehow
I dont know--

LEO
Connected

Mary looks up sharply to see if hes making fun of her
Hes not She holds his gaze for a moment and then glances
away Shes unable to keep a small measure of satisfaction
out of her voice
MARY
He couldnt stand it
LEO
I‘m glad you stood up to hin
Mary laughs
MARY
Oh well I didnt Im not terribly
brave I made the donation without
telling hin

FLASH CUT

INT ALISTAIRS FLAT - BEDROOM - FLASHBACK -- NIGHT

The mans hand RIPS away the bandage Exposes two tiny red
punctures on the womans skin

MARY (V0)
He found out later

The man is Alistair He rears back from Mary looking shocked
and betrayed

EXT REGENTS PARK CAFE - PATIO -- EVENING
Mary falls silent Leo studies her

LEO
What does he think of us meeting now

MARY
It doesnt matter Hes not ay
boyfriend anymore

There is quiet defiance in these last words Leo picks up
his fork and spears another piece of cake

LEO
Maybe you are brave

He eats with a smile Mary finds herself smiling back
This time she doesnt look away

DISSOLVE TO
EXT REGENT‘S PARK -- LATE EVENING

Mary and Leo walk along the shadow-dappled path Leo has
his hands thrust deep into his jacket pockets

LEO
My brother didnt want me to write to

might be I dont know God squad
or something

Mary laughs
MARY
Imploring you to find faith in the
miracle of your salvation
LEO

Maybe Or maybe youd be somebody
looking for an emotional boost

)

MARY
Im glad you took the risk

LEO
Believing youre going to die changes
your idea of risk

They come to a fork in the path They stop and face each
other a comfortably awkward pause

MARY
I had a lovely time meeting you Leo
Thank you

She offers her hand Leo takes it in both of his

LEO
Im the one who should be thanking
you

He hugs her suddenly We see Marys face over his shoulder
Shes surprised and moved by the intensity of the embrace

And then just as swiftly he releases her He steps back
looking embarrassed

LEO (CONTD)
Sorry Im sorry

Mary cant help but smile Both shift from foot to foot
Both prolonging the moment

Then Leo takes another more resolute step away from her
He grins sheepishly Gives a little wave goodbye

Mary waves back Watches him back away down the opposite
fork before finally turning and disappearing into the
gathering dark

EXT REGENTS PARK - NEAR THE EXIT -- LATE EVENING

Mary strolls along happily lost in a replay of the evening

A DARK SHAPE glimpsed through the foliage Keeping pace
with her

She peers out through the curtains

Down below a FIGURE crosses the garden It steals up to the

into the darkness once again

Mary shakes her head sadly
INT FREDERICAS HOUSE - FREDERICAS BEDROOM -- LATE EVENING

the room shining off the artifacts her Grandmother has
collected on her travels South Sea carvings Greek marble
an antique brass telescope mounted by the window

of Gushi curled up on the bed in a nest of toys and treats
She tiptoes over Gives the dog a pat and whispers

calls after her

BEAN (CCNTD)

leashes around a fence post and steps up to the door of the
Barker-Pryce house He sorts through his HEAVY RING of keys

when she sees who is waiting outside her door Alistair

BEAN
Nothing like that--

BARKER-PRYCE
Youve been paid

Barker-Pryce fixes him with a withering look Bean lets a
measure of iron seep into his tone

BEAN (CONTD)

Barker-Pryce glares for a moment longer Then--surprisingly--
Clearly frustrated--he drops his eyes and barks

( )
BARKER-PRYCE

Bean smiles
INT TERRACE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Alistair follows Mary into the kitchen She hides her
awkwardness by searching the cupboards for a flower vase
He tries for a casual tone

ALISTAIR

Mary is silent

ALISTAIR (CONTD)
Youre seeing someone arent you

MARY
Of course not

ALISTAIR
Are you trying to make me jealous

The news shocks Alistair

ALISTAIR
The man who received your donation

MARY

You dont see the harm You had the
operation without telling me You

Desperately arranges the flowers as Alistair comes up behind

ALISTAIR
Youll have to call first wont you

She looks at him standing there cross and petulant and
suddenly finds herself able to call his bluff She jerks
her bag off the table and pulls out her keys

Surprised Alistair suddenly waves off his demand

ALISTAIR (CONTD)
Never mind Keep them keep them

She stops Alistair moves past her and opens the door

( )
ALISTAIR (CONTD)
That was thoughtless of me I dont

He slips out the door Closes it behind hin

Mary looks at the keys clearly feeling miserable that she
didnt follow through She tosses them back into her bag

INT FANCY RESTAURANT EVENING

The interior is all cream walls starched linen and winking
silver Leo fidgets at a table aware that he looks out of

to meet her His relief is palpable

They sit Leo fidgets again Mary aligns cutlery Finally

MARY (CONTD)
This is a very nice restaurant

He plucks out another chip Uses it to point to a club across
the street

There is a long line of COLORFUL PEOPLE waiting to get past
the velvet ropes The CLUB HOSTESS--a punked-out woman with
a clipboard-moves among them choosing the ELEGANT and
OUTLANDISH for early admission
Mary shakes her head
MARY
T couldnt get into that place with a
ticket
LEO
Attitude It’s all in the attitude

Leo tosses the carton of chips into the trash and pulls off
his leather jacket

LEO (CONTD)
Put this on

( )

Mary hands him her purse while she slips on the jacket She
reacts with surprise as Leo opens it and digs through its
contents

He pulls out her money Shuffles it together with his own
to create a thick wad of bills She notices him placing the
biggest notes on top

LEO (CONTD)
The key to getting inside any club is
to pretend its the last place you

want to be
MARY
How do I do that
LEO

Think about your ex naked in bed
Mary looks repulsed Leo grins

LEO (CONTD)
Now hold that look

EXT CLUB -- NIGHT

The Club Hostess selects a GOTH COUPLE from the line Looking
around she catches sight of

Leo and Mary stalking towards her Leo gives the place a
bored once-over Radiates an aura of jaded cool Mary tries
her best to imitate hin

The Hostess is hooked Leo offers her a disdainful flash of
their money and she waves the two past the line and into the
club When SOMEONE ELSE tries to follow she uses her
clipboard like a toll gate

CLUB HOSTESS
Join the queue mate

INT CLUB -- NIGHT

POUNDING MUSIC Lights PEOPLE dancing Leo and Mary luck

MARY
Are the two of you close

LEO
He looks out for me When youre
ill friends fade away After a while
not talking about this thing you live
with becomes too much for everyone
Its like being in a bad relationship

He divides up their money Doesnt notice Marys thoughtful
expression

Leo beams

MARY
I imagine when youre sick or
weak thats all people see

LEO
And if they treat you that way long
enough you start to believe thats
all you are

MARY
Until it becomes true

LEO
Well not anymore You and I are going
to start fresh

MARY
No baggage

LEO
No backgrounds Think about it My
bones are filled with your marrow--

MARY

positively infused with Mary Jago

MARY
Poor you

LEO

MARY
To be whoever we want to be

( )
LEO
To be who we really are

The idea startles her a little Shes very aware of Leo
watching her

LEO (CONTD)
I know nothing about Mary Jago except
that she likes chocolate cake

MARY
And I know nothing about Leo Nash
except

And then she flounders Leo waits expectantly that gently
mocking smile on his face Mary leans across the table and
works loose the knot of his tie

MARY (CONTD)
He feels more comfortable without the
tie

She sits back pulling the tie with her It slithers from
around his neck Leo smiles

LATER IN THE EVENING - AT THE BAR
Leo buys two beers Carries them back through the crowd to
the booth There are several empty glasses already on the
table Mary is pleasantly tipsy
MARY (CONTD)
Why cant men ever take the hint that
a girl doesnt want to be bothered

LEO
Uhh I can sit somewhere else

MARY
Not you No no

She gestures to a SEXY YOUNG WOMAN in a green dress sitting

at a nearby table She appears to be fending off the advances

of a man with a CREWCUT
MARY (CONTD)
Shes obviously waiting for her
boyfriend

LEO
She is

( )

MARY
Well for somebody You dont come
to a place like this alone

Crewcut departs Mary looks pleased

MARY (CONTD)

LEO

He scans the club Points surreptitiously

LEO (CONTD)

phone to punctuate his conversation with a YOUNG BUSINESS-
TYPE

MARY
I hate mobile phones

LEO
Hes the pagerman

Mary looks blank Leo grins

LEO (CONTD)
People call hig pager He phones
back and arranges a meeting to check
them out If theyre cool he sets a
price and sends them to the dripper

As they watch the Business-Type slips away from Mr Slick
and crosses to the Woman in the green dress Mary gives Leo
a puzzled look

MARY
I don‘t--

LEO
Watch their hands

Mary stares openly at the Woman who once more appears to be
warding off a bothersome advance but

( )
AT THE EDGE OF THE TABLE

There is a fast dance of hands Folded bills are traded for
a vial full of powder The Business-fype moves off

Mary gapes and is suddenly alight

MARY
Was that a drug deal Did I just see
a drug deal

LEO
Sshhh Shes only carrying a bit of
their stash Selling it off one drip
at a time

MARY
A dripper

LEO
Theyll work this place for a few
hours then move on to another club

MARY

respond They walk on

EXT PRIVATE GARDEN -- NIGHT
Mary unlocks the gate and swings it open with a CREAK Leo
follows her in Lowers himself onto the grass Hes a little
breathless and looks a lot more tired now
LEO
I always wondered what these gardens

MARY
Theyre private to the local residents

LEO
Keeping out the peasants

Then he realizes what hes said and colors

LEO (CONTD)
Mary Im sorry

She studies his embarrassment Comes to a decision

MARY
Do you think the house on the Crescent
is mine

LEO

Thats the address I received from
the Harvest Trust

MARY
Six bedrooms All that terribly heavy
furniture Does that seem like me

LEO
How can I know whats inside It

leather

MARY
Leopard prints and leather

LEO
Red leather

She laughs

( )

MARY
Im house sitting for an old couple
The Blackburn-Norrises Theyre
travelling all summer Im not rich

She catches sight of the tomb-like entrance of the Nursemaids
Passage and shivers She walks back and sits on the grass
beside Leo He regards her closely

LEO
A big empty house a private
garden perfect for locking yourself
away from the world

MARY
Oh not the world

LEO
Your ex Alistair

MARY

It was time to leave
LEO

Why
MARY

Because keeping secrets from him didnt
make me feel guilty anymore It made
me feel strong

LEO
Like the marrow donation

She nods and closes her eyes Leo watches her lay back

LEO (CONTD)
Mary

MARY
Mmom

LEO
Where did they take it from

With her eyes still closed she takes one of his hands and
places it on the curve of her hip

MARY
Feel that That ridge of bone Thats
the Iliac Crest

LEO
The Iliac Crest Is there a scar

( )

She looks at him now Her skirt zips up at the side She
slowly pulls down the tab parting the metal teeth to reveal
the pale unmarked skin of her hip

Leo moves to touch it stopping just before he makes contact

LEO (CONTD)
Can 1

Mary nods her eyes aglow She reacts to the feel of his
fingers against the skin He speaks with soft wonder

LEO (CONTD)
No mark Nothing to remember me by

MARY
Where did they where did you receive
it

He breaks contact Rolls ups his shirt sleeve Mary traces
a finger down a line of faint scars on his inner arn

MARY (CONTD)
So many

LEO
Lots of treatments But thats the
one there Thats you Your donation
I circled it in pen ‘til I was sure
Id remember

He stretches out beside her

LEO (CONTD)
The doctors were so cautious but I
knew the transplant would work Even
now when I get tired or bruised up
I know its nothing

He speaks with a gently desperate conviction
LEO (CONTD)
Im getting better all the time I
feel it

Mary only hears the conviction She shuts her eyes Leo
whispers

LEO (CONTD)
It’s very late I should get you
home

Mary keeps her eyes closed

Mary takes the handkerchief from him Gently dabs the blood
from around his nose and lips

MARY

He hears something in the distance A ghostly sound A
layered CLOPPING

MARY
You should get home You should--

run to

EXT HARLEY STREET -- DAWN

Leo pulls Mary around the corner She stops in surprise at
the sight of

HORSES In rows of three Marching down the deserted street
toward them Each center horse has a RIDER hooded in a
dark slicker eyes hidden

Mary watches in amazement as they come past Row after row
Like some dream underscored by the CLIP-CLOPPING of hooves

Leo speaks softly as if afraid of breaking the moment

LEO
From the Hyde Park barracks You
never know which street theyll take
They change their route to fox the
terrorists

The horses pass heading down Harley Street They disappear
from half-light Mary turns to Leo her eyes shining She
sees a last thin streak of blood at the corner of his mouth
She touches it smearing it Fascinated And then on
impulse she goes up on tiptoe and kisses him on that same
spot
Leo returns the kiss The two stand there in the empty
street pressed together as the sound of the hooves fades
fades

LEO (CONTD)
Carl always tried to dismiss my
interest in you as something unhealthy
Like another symptom of the disease

MARY
You still havent told him weve been
in touch

LEO
Things are tense between us

MARY
Why

LEO
Some idiot doctor told Carl that being
my brother puts him at risk of
developing leukemia himself Because
of our genetic similarity One time
he had a nosebleed

LEO (CONTD)
Mary cant you see what hes doing

Why would he bother

LEO
Because hes a bitter old man who
resents the fact that a guy like me
can be inside with you while hes out
there with your dog

MARY
He said horrible things about your
brother

LEO
Carl is no saint

MARY
He deals drugs doesnt he

Meeting at the crest of a small rise There is a fast dance
of hands as folded bills are exchanged for a bag of heroin
As they move apart we see

It was about a poor little heiress
trying to make a connection

Why are you acting like this

Dreading his reaction

Someone to parade in front of your
bank buddies I was an accessory A
bit of upper class flash like your

He pulls her to the center of the space where he does a slow
spin They seem to be in an endless expanse of silver
shadowed grass The horizon is tinged red by the glow of
the surrounding city Lights from the distant buildings
seem a world away

under the bridge

Hob is there stretched out on his back the syringe still
stuck in his bare foot His dead eyes staring at the
brickwork above

Next to Hob is a gory knife One of the Inspectors fishes
something out of Hobs pocket A blood-dewed credit card

INSPECTOR
Well well well

He shows the card to his partner CLOSE ON the name Alistair
Winter

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PARK CRESCENT -- MORNING

The white houses look pale and ghostly Alistair’s car is
Still parked at the curb Beaded with dew

The door to the Terrace House opens Leo steps out He
checks an address on a slip of paper and heads down the
street

Mary watches him from the upper floor window She looks
like a ghost herself a pallid figure barely real behind the
glass

The PULSING SOUND from the opening scenes begins again as

Leo is shown into the room and left to wait He looks around
nervously

finishes dressing Eyes herself in the mirror above the
vanity

INT DOCTORS OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING

FOAMY BLOOD is drawn into the syringe The PULSING SOUND

INT DOCTORS OFFICE - WAITING ROOM -- DAY

Leo leafs through a magazine Hes anxious The door to
the examination room opens and Dr Phillips waves him in

INT DOCTORS OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM -- DAY
Dr Phillips motions Leo to a chair He consults a file

DR PHILLIPS

results Your blood hasnt been
clotting properly

LEO

DR PHILLIPS
Calm down Its not leukemia Its
a temporary condition brought on by
the presence of something in your
system A substance called Warfarin

LEO
Warfarin

DR PHILLIPS
Yes Its found in rat poison But
its mainly used as a blood-thinning
medication for elderly heart patients

( )

Leo exhales sharply
EXT TERRACE HOUSE -- DAY

Leo races up to the door Grabs at the knob Locked He
tries to shove his key in the hole but it wont fit

He blinks at the bright new hardware The lock has been
changed

LEO
Mary

Snarling he punches the door

EXT FREDERICAS HOUSE -- DAY

Leo stands in front of Fredericas house Staring at the
neglected garden The metal grills pulled shut inside the
windows

He approaches the door Peers through the side window

Then he crouches and pushes open the mail slot to squint
inside

The door opens under his hands

INT FREDERICAS HOUSE - FRONT HALL -- DAY

Leo eases the door open and steps inside He sees something
on the floor near the entrance to the living room His duffel
bag Packed and waiting

Suddenly furious Leo kicks it aside

INT FREDERICAS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY

Leo steps into the room Takes in the sheet-covered
furniture Then he notices something on the mantel

A pill vial

He walks over and snatches it up Reads the label “JAGO
FREDERICA WARFARIN TWICE DAILY AS DIRECTED

Leo flings it aside It rolls to the entrance Coming to a
stop near Marys feet

She picks it up Straightens to meet his look of surprise

LEO
Youre here

( )

MARY
Im home Did you think Id run away
She gestures to his bag

MARY (CONTD)
Your things are all there

Hes confused by her calm Her confidence He lets tears
well up in his eyes

LEO
Do you know what you did to me Do
you have any idea

Mary is unmoved

LEO (CONTD)
You poisoned me

MARY
I obliged you You wanted to be my
Leo

Leo blinks away the useless tears his expression suddenly
fired with rage He advances on her as if to strike her
Mary meets his gaze

MARY (CONTD)
You still could be

She gives the vial a gentle shake RATTILING the remaining
pills together

Leo stares She meets his gaze evenly For a long moment
neither one moves

Then Leo drops his eyes He moves carefully past her Picks
up his duffel bag and walks out

The front door CLOSES a moment later
MARY (CONTD)
No mark No scar Nothing to remember
you by

She stands there for a moment longer Then she walks around
the room and begins pulling the dust covers off the furniture

DISSOLVE TO

EXT FREDERICAS HOUSE -- DAY

Weeks later and the garden is lush and bright and well-
maintained The trim freshly painted Roman carries Marys
suitcases to the taxi at the curb

ROMAN
Did the police investigation turn up
anything else

MARY
No It was just another mugging
Some drug addict Case closed

ROMAN
Poor Alistair

MarySbrief look of sadness flits across her face

MARY
He always said the park was dangerous
after dark

She glances back at the house

MARY (CONTD)
Youll check on the place occasionally
Water the garden

ROMAN
You could have hired a housesitter

Mary hides a small smile Roman puts her suitcases in the
taxi

ROMAN (CONTD)
The Museum wont be the same without
you

MARY

Holmes survived without his Irene

Besides Ive been told a woman should

travel
He hands her a stack of Irene Adler postcards Mary laughs
and hugs him tightly She climbs into the cab Roman closes
the door Waves as it pulls away ‘
INT TAXI -- DAY

Mary sits gently rocked by the motion of the car She slips
the postcards into her purse

Beside the vial of Warfarin

( )
She pulls out something else The square photo of a smiling
Leo

She stares at the image for a long moment Then she cracks
the window and offers the picture to the gap The wind
catches it

Gone

Mary leans back temple to the window glass She watches
the neighbourhood houses BLUR past

After a moment she closes her eyes
EXT STREET -- DAY

The wind carries Leos photo to the sidewalk where it
disappears beneath the scrabble of furry legs Bean is
passing by with his squad of dogs

He stops outside a house Loops the leashes around a fence
post and walks to the door

He knocks

There is no answer Bean takes a key off the HEAVY RING at
his waist Unlocks the door

BEAN
Hello Mrs Goldsworthy

Still no answer With a crafty smile Bean slips inside and
Closes the door

We HOLD on the blank door for a moment Then begin to PULL
BACK Past the huddle and scratch of the dogs Past the
curb and street BACK until we see a whole sweep of the
street And from that succession of blank doors and empty
windows we

FADE OUT
