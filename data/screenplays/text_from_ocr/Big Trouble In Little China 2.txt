Chinese motifs finished in red lacquer Egg looks down the
streets into alleys Hes distracted and lecturing half-
heartedly Steve sits nearby and questions much to Eggs
annoyance -- and to the mystification of the tourists

EGG SHEN
No Chinese men were brought
over to work on the railroads Women
followed later but the first
generations never really assimilated

STEVE
Yeah they brought their own beliefs
their mystical priests their magic

EGG SHEN
Not true Actually insulting to
Chinese There are of course no
such things as demons sorcery or
magic within the Chinese scheme
of beliefs Chinese are very rational
law-abiding

STEVE
What about the Tong wars

At this Egg swerves the bus over to the curb in front of a4

Lets go
He tries to lead Kim off She doesnt move

KIM
No Wait

BRAD
Wait For what

KIM
Nothing Im Im curious
that’s all

BRAD
You dont believe in this

KIM

She hurries after Egg and Steve

BRAD
HeyWait

Brad brings up the rear Kim finds Steve Egg scurries on
ahead Steve has stopped to study an object

STEVE
Chuan do Amazing
KIM
» Whats that

STEVE
An ancient surgical instrument
These people your people
were doing open heart surgery
four centuries before Christ

KIM
Since when is a guy like you
so interested in Chinese
culture

STEVE
Since I was a kid growing up
with my father in China
The first image I can remember
is the Gum Lung ceremony

KIM
The first image I can remember is
The Flintstones

That breaks the spell

eS STEVE
Dont you wonder I mean

were so modern so arrogant
But we have no idea of the beauty
of the ancient ways of what
was lost over time Of what the
real powers are

KIM

You mean my grandmas stories
STEVE

Not stories but traditions The

ancient rituals The Myths Even
todays China isnt China anymore
Theres even a fast food burger joint
across from the Forbidden City

BRAD
You know Im hungry

STEVE
Only in certain areas
well hidden do the ancient
mysteries live
They have a moment Steve turns Brads there frowning

BRAD
Can we get on with this
Im starved For me eating
is an ancient mystery

Kim glances at Steve

STEVE
The magic has left China But
I think its herein Little China
This jadeits the keyproof
of the existence of ancient beliefs

Kim smiles glances at Brad then slips away

INT STORE

Eggs busy With mental powers alone he repairs objects
broken in the fight Pieces fly onto shelves broken pottery

reassembles itself Kims slips in Her mouth drops open

KIM
How did you

Egg putters around combining ingredients into spheres

EGG SHEN
Magic perhaps

KIM
You dont expect me to believe
that

STEVE

You know what I think That the

wise ones like Egg allow the ancient
secrets to fall into myth The less
the public knows the better

EGG SHEN
Yes its a constant struggle to
keep the ancient beliefs alive yet
secret and to find young people
with the moral character to become
guardians of the CHAI TAO

He looks intently at Kim She turns away Egg looks pensive
STEVE

How about me I could be a
guardian
Egg considers then reaches around his neck The CHAI TAO
piece dangles from a gold chain Egg takes off his necklace
steps forward Steve grins -- thinking its for him -- and
reaches for it But Eeg presents it to KIM

KIM
Whats this

Kim looks at it The colors ripple in her hand

EGG SHEN
It is meant for you

KIM
Its beautifulbut

EGG SHEN
If you are going to act so
recklessly you must carry it
at all times

BRAD
Dont take it Kim
This is creepy

KIM
No I cant

EGG SHEN
You must
(Hes overstated something
backs off to save face)
Please

KIM
But why me Im American not
Asian I want nothing to do with
the old ways

STEVE
You study martial arts

KIM
For self-defense

STEVE
But you saw Egg

KIM
Ahthe light was bad

Steve slips in next to her

STEVE
Take the piece Take it
Its the THIRD PIECE OF THE
CHAI TAO

Kim knows somethings going on but doesnt know quite what
And the piece is very beautiful Egg grins

KIM
Well okay Thank you
EGG SHEN

No Thank you

Egg smiles enigmatically slips away Kim and Steve look at
each other and the jade for an awkward moment It GLOWS and
PULSES It SHIMMERS in her hand

KIM
Its pretty but magic
powers I dont know

STEVE
Then how do you explain
this

He tries a trick touches the jade rubs his hands mumbles
incantations spreads his palms A flash He staggers back

BRAD
What was that

STEVE
Holy cow I almost had it
down

KIM
(contemptuous)
Thats it The magic Youre
going to go up against sorcerers
»with that

Egg returns smilingat Steve He hold ancient texts

EGG SHEN
He thinks he knows everything

Egg makes a quick move a glowing lotus blossom appears then
dissolves into a golden mist

» STEVE
Howd you do that

EGG SHEN
You know the thing up here
(indicates his head)
You must know it down here

He indicates his heart

STEVE
But I do

EGG SHEN
You think you do We shall
see

Steve makes the same kind of gesture A blossom starts to
appear Then dissolves in a poof Egg is slightly impressed

STEVE
Now do you believe me

EGG SHEN
No But I do need all the help

I can get
Ss (He smiles Hes kidding )
Come grasshopper We must prepare

He zips through the maze grabbing a vial here a lacquer box
there Steve hops to follow

EGG SHEN

a wizened old man but a powerful wizard

Egg turns to Kim He offers the potion She ignores it
aa

EGG SHEN
You deny your heritage

KIM
My heritage Subservience to men
to the old ways

EGG SHEN
Ahhhhyes You are overly
rational Not a common failing
among women

KIM
(irritated)
Thank you

Steve just smiles at Kimhe feels the potion taking effect

KIM (CONTD)
to Steve)
What are you staring at

Steve spreads his hands A faint charge flickers between his
palms Eggs intrigued He points to a glowing incense coal
on his altar to his ancestors

EGG SHEN
If you really believed
one could pick it up in your
bare hands that is if
you are truly worthy

STEVE
And if net

EGG SHEN
Oh itll burn the hell out
of you You must have faith
or a comprehensive health plan

Egg looks at Steve critically gauging his reaction

Steve picks up the fiery ember Eggs intrigued Steve
glances at Kim loses concentration cries out drops the

coal
EGG SHEN

Of course hot coals are a
problem for those with short
attention spans
Egg picks up the coal pops it into his mouth swallows it

He burps discreetly A small flame bursts from his mouth

EGG SHEN
Excuse me See not just faith
but heart Otherwise all you’ll
wind up with is heartburn

Egg winks at Kim He knows there is a growing attraction
between Steve and Kim Brad senses it too

BRAD
(testily)
Come on

KIM

BRAD
We gotta go

KIM

BRAD
This is not our fight

The Chai Tao glows in Kims hand It radiates a
greenishwhite light

EGG

together to form the complete CHAI TAO but Egg takes them
