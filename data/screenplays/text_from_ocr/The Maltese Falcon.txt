flexible V of his mouth The V motif is picked up again by
thickish brows rising upward from twin creases above a
hooked nose His dark hair grows down to a point on his
forehead He looks rather pleasantly like Satan Spade is
rolling a cigarette OVER SCENE the SOUND of the office
door opening He does not look up

(he puts the
cigarette in
his mouth sets
fire to it)

The door opens again Effie Perine stands with her hand
on the knob
EFFIE

OVER SCENE a voice murmurs something then MISS WONDERLY
appears advances slowly with tentative steps looks at
Spade with eyes that are both shy and probing Spade
rises bows indicates with a thick-fingered hand the
oaken armchair beside his desk

MISS WONDERLY
(softly)
Thank you

She sits down on the edge of the chairs wooden seat

Spade sinks back into his swivel chair makes a quarter
turn to face her OVER SCENE the tappety-tap-tap of Effie
Perines typewriter Spade smiles politely White teeth
glisten in the crescent Miss Wonderlys answering smile
makes She remains erect in the chair as if she expected
to stay seated for only a moment Her hands in dark gloves
clasp and unclasp the flat dark handbag in her lap

SPADE
(rocking back in
chair)
Now what can I do for you Miss
Wonderly

She catches her breath looks at him swallows

MISS WONDERLY

(hurriedly)
Could you -- I thought -- I --
that is

She tortures her lower lip Only her dark eyes speak now
pleading Spade smiles and nods

SPADE
(after several moments)
Suppose you tell me about it from
the very beginning

MISS WONDERLY
That was in New York

SPADE
Yes

And now the words tumble out
MISS WONDERLY
I dont know where she met him in
New York Shes much younger than I
-- only seventeen -- we didnt have
the same friends Father and mother
are in Europe It would kill them
Ive got to get her back before they
come home

He nods as though the rush of words made perfect sense
to him

SPADE
Yes

MISS WONDERLY
Theyre coming home the first of
the month

SPADE
(reassuringly)
That gives us two weeks

MISS WONDERLY

I didnt know what she had done
until her letter came I was
frantic

(her lips tremble)
I didnt know what to do

(pathetically)
What could I do

SPADE
(in the gentle tones
one uses to a child
on the the verge of
tears)
Nothing of course But then her
letter came

MISS WONDERLY

Yes

(again the words

tumble forth)
And I sent her a telegram asking her
to come back home I sent it to
General Delivery here That was the
only address she gave me I
waited a whole week but no answer
came -- and mothers and fathers
return was growing nearer and
nearer so I came out here to get
her I wrote her I was coming I
shouldnt have done that should I
SPADE
Its not always easy to know what to
do You havent found her

MISS WONDERLY
No I havent I wrote her that I
would go to the St Mark and I
begged her to meet me there and let
me talk to her I waited three
days She didnt come didnt
even send a message

Spade nods frowns sympathetically

MISS WONDERLY

It was horrible Waiting
---Not knowing what had happened to
her -- what might be happening to
her

(she stops trying to

smile -- shudders)
I wrote her another letter General
Delivery Yesterday afternoon I
went to the post office I stayed
there until after dark but I didnt
see her I went there again this
morning and still didnt see Corinne
-- but I saw Floyd Thursby

Spades frown goes away In its place comes a look of sharp
attentiveness

MISS WONDERLY
He wouldnt tell me where Corinne
was
(hopelessly)
He wouldnt tell me anything except
that she was well and happy But
hed say that anyway wouldnt he

SPADE
It might be true

MISS WONDERLY

(tremblingly)
I hope it is I do hope it is
But but he said she didnt
want to see me I cant believe
that He promised to tell her he
had seen me and to bring her to see
me if she would come this evening
at the hotel He said he knew she
wouldnt He promised to come
himself if she didnt
The office door opens She breaks off with a startled hand
to her mouth The man who opened the door comes in a step

ARCHER
Oh excuse me --
(hastily he takes
off his brown hat
starts to back out)

SPADE
Its all right Miles Come in
Miss Wonderly this is Mr Archer
my partner

Archer ducks his head smiling at Miss Wonderly shuts the
door behind him and makes a vague gesture with the hat in
his hand He is of medium height solidly built wide in
the shoulders thick in the neck with a heavy-jawed red

face He is about as many years past forty as Spade is
past thirty

SPADE

Miss Wonderlys sister ran away from
New York with a fellow named Floyd
Thursby They are here in San
Francisco Miss Wonderly has seen
Thursby and has a date with him
tonight Maybe hell bring the
sister with him The chances are he
wont Miss Wonderly wants us to
find the sister and get her away
from him and back home

(he looks at Miss

Wonderly)
Right

MISS WONDERLY
(indistinctly)
Yes

Archer comes forward to the corner of the desk While the
girl looks at her bag he looks at her His little brown
eyes run their bold appraising gaze from her lowered face
to her feet and up to her face again Then he looks at
Spade and makes a silent whistling mouth of appreciation
Spade winks at him

SPADE
Its simply a matter of having a man
at the hotel this evening to shadow
him when he leads us to your sister
If she doesnt want to leave him
after weve found her -- well there
are ways of managing that
ARCHER
(his voice heavy
coarse)
Yeah

Miss Wonderly looks up quickly Fear shows on her

MISS WONDERLY

Oh but you must be careful

(her voice shakes

a little and her

lips shape the

words with nervous

jerkiness)
Im deathly afraid of him -- of what
he might do Shes so young and his
bringing her here from New York is
such a serious -- mightnt he --
mightnt he do something to her

Spade smiles pats the arms of his chair

SPADE
Just leave that to us Well know
how to handle him

MISS WONDERLY

(earnestly)
But I want you to know that hes
a dangerous man I honestly dont
think hed stop at anything I
dont believe hed hesitate to --
to kill Corinne if he thought it
would save him

ARCHER
Can he cover up by marrying her

MISS WONDERLY
(blushes in confusion)
He has a wife and three children
in England

SPADE
They usually do though not always
in England
(reaching for
pencil and pad)
What does he look like

Spade makes notes as she talks

face
MISS WONDERLY
He has dark hair and thick eyebrows
He talks in a loud blustery way He
gives the impression of being -- a
violent person

SPADE
Thin medium or heavy-built

MISS WONDERLY
Quite athletic Hes broad-
shouldered and has what could be
called a military carriage He was
wearing a light gray suit and a gray
hat when I saw him this morning

SPADE
(laying down the
pencil)
What does he do for a living

MISS WONDERLY
I havent the slightest idea

SPADE
At what time is he coming to see
you

MISS WONDERLY
After eight oclock

SPADE
All right Miss Wonderly Well
have a man there

ARCHER
(interjects)
Ill look after it myself

Spade gives him a glance of concealed amusement
MISS WONDERLY
(pathetically grateful)
Thank you Thank you

She opens her handbag with nervous fingers brings out two
bills puts them on Spades desk

MISS WONDERLY
Will that be enough

Spade nods She gives Spade her hand Then in the same
graceful tone
MISS WONDERLY

Thank you Thank you
SPADE
Not at all Itll help some if

you meet Thursby in the lobby

MISS WONDERLY
I will

ARCHER
You dont have to look for me
Ill see you all right

She nods Spade goes to the door with Miss Wonderly

MISS WONDERLY
(repeats once again)
Thank you

When she is gone Spade comes back to his desk Archer has
picked up one of the bills is examining it

ARCHER
(growls complacently)
Theyre right enough
(he folds it
and tucks it
in his vest
pocket)
And they have brothers in her bag

Spade pockets the other bill before sitting down

SPADE
What do you think of her

ARCHER
Sweet
(guffaws suddenly)
Maybe you saw her first Sam but
I spoke first

He puts his hands in his trousers pockets and teeters on
his heels Spade behind his desk grins wolfishly at
Archer showing the edges of his teeth far back in his
jaws

SPADE
Youve got brains Yes you have

He begins to make a cigarette

DISSOLVE TO
DARKNESS

A telephone is RINGING It rings three times Then the
SOUND of bed-springs creaking and of the instrument being
lifted

SPADES VOICE

Hello Yes speaking Dead
Yes Fifteen minutes Where
Bush and Stockton Thanks

The SOUND of the instrument being replaced followed by the
click of a switch

INT SPADES ROOM

Spade barefoot in checked pajamas sits on the side of his
bed scowling at the telephone The hands of a tinny alarm
clock which sits on a volume of Dukes Celebrated
Criminal Cases of America are at five minutes past two
Spade scratches the back of his neck reaches for a packet
of brown papers and a sack of tobacco by the telephone
makes a cigarette with deliberate care licks it puts it
in his mouth The curtains at the two open windows
flutter From across the bay comes the dull moaning of the
Alcatraz fog horn Spade sits for several moments with the
cold cigarette in his mouth Then he reaches for the
telephone again dials a number Waiting for the answer
he shivers

SPADE
(into the telephone)
Send a cab to

DISSOLVE TO
MED SHOT - FRONT OF SECOND CLASS APARTMENT BLDG - NIGHT

The overhead arc throws light on faces at the windows
CAMERA PULLS BACK past a uniformed policeman who is
chewing gum to include the sign on the lamp post BUSH
STREET Cars are parked helter-skelter on either side of
the street A taxi comes into scene stops in the middle
of the street Spade gets out gives the driver money As
he starts across the street toward CAMERA the policeman
puts out an arm

POLICEMAN

SPADE

his arm goes down)
I didnt know you at first Theyre

(he jerks a thumb
over his shoulder)

CAMERA PANS with him toward the alley-way in which a dark
ambulance stands

MED SHOT - THE ALLEY-WAY

as Spade enters It is bordered on one side by a waist-
high fence Spade crosses to a place where a ten-foot
length of the top rail of the fence has been torn from a
post at one end and hangs dangling from the other He
looks down

LONG SHOT - THE HILLSIDE

SHOOTING over Spades shoulder From the foot of the fence
the hillside drops steeply away Fifteen feet down the
slope a flat boulder sticks up Two men stand in the angle
between the boulder and slope One is pointing a camera

A bulb flashes and we get a momentary glimpse of a body
lying on the boulder Other men with lights move up and
down the slope One of them raises a torch so the beam
strikes Spade in the face

POLHAUS
(calls)
Hello Sam

Lowering the beam Tom Polhaus clambers up to the alley
his shadow running before him Stepping over the fence he
joins Spade by the broken rail He is a barrel-bellied
tall man with shrewd small eyes His shoes his hands and
his knees are covered with mud

POLHAUS
I figured youd want to see it
before we took him away

SPADE
Thanks Tom What happened

Polhaus points at his own left breast with a muddy finger
POLHAUS

Got him right through the pump
with this

He takes a flat revolver from his coat pocket holds it
toward Spade but Spade doesnt take it After a moment
Polhaus flashes his light on it Mud inlays the
depressions in the revolvers surface

POLHAUS
A Webley English aint it

Spade takes his elbow from the fence post leans down to
look at the weapon but does not touch it

SPADE
Yes Webley-Fosbery Automatic
Revolver thirty-eight eight shot
They dont make them anymore How
many gone out of it

POLHAUS
One pill

breast again)

SPADE

(speaking quickly)
He was shot up here huh standing
like you are with his back to the
fence The man that shot him stands
here

(he goes in front

of Polhaus and

raises his hand

chest high with

a leveled fore-

finger)
Miles goes back taking the top off
the fence and going on through and
down till the rock catches him
That it

POLHAUS
Thats it
(he works his
brows together)
The blast burnt his coat

SPADE
Who found him

POLHAUS
Man on the boat

SPADE
Anybody hear the shot

POLHAUS

Somebody mustve We only just got
here Sam

(turning he puts

a leg back over

the fence)
Coming down for a look at him before
hes moved

SPADE
(shortly)
No

Polhaus astride the fence looks at Spade with surprised
small eyes

SPADE
Youve seen everything I could

Polhaus nods doubtfully withdraws leg from the fence

POLHAUS
His gun was tucked away on his hip
It hadnt been fired His overcoat
was buttoned There was a hundred
dollar bill in his vest pocket and
thirty some bucks in his pants
Was he working Sam

After a moments hesitation Sam nods

POLHAUS
Well

SPADE
He was supposed to be tailing a
fellow named Floyd Thursby

POLHAUS
What for

Spade puts his hands into his overcoat pocket blinks
sleepy eyes at Polhaus

POLHAUS
(impatiently)
What for

SPADE
We were trying to find out where
he lived

He gins slightly takes his hand from his pocket pats
Polhaus shoulder

SPADE

Dont crowd me

(his hands go

back into his

pockets)
Im going out to break the news to
Miles wife

(He turns away)

Polhaus scowling opens his mouth closes it without
having said anything clears his throat puts the scowl off
his face and speaks with a husky sort of gentleness

POLHAUS
Its tough -- him getting it like
that Miles had his faults same as
the rest of us but I guess he must
of had some good points too

SPADE
I guess so

He goes toward the mouth of the alley The brick wall to
his left reflects the light of another flash bulb

9 MED SHOT - BUSH STREET

Spade comes out of the alley turns down Bush Street The
uniformed policeman is on the sidewalk now

POLICEMAN

INT CORRIDOR - CLOSE SHOT

Polhaus and Lieutenant Dundy Spades face brightens
His eyes lose their harassed expression

SPADE

They nod together neither saying anything and enter
Spade shuts the door as they go toward his bedroom

INT SPADES BEDROOM - MED SHOT - SPADE POLHAUS DUNDY

as Polhaus sits on and end of the sofa and Spade on the
side of the bed The Lieutenant takes a chair beside the
table Lieutenant Dundy is a compactly-built man with a
round head and short-cut grizzled hair and a square face
behind a short-cut grizzled moustache

A five-dollar gold piece is pinned to his necktie and there
is a small elaborate diamond-set secret society emblem on
his lapel He examines the room with hard deliberate
eyes Then he looks at Polhaus who shifts uncomfortably
on the sofa

POLHAUS
Did you break the news to Miles
wife Sam

SPADE
Uh-huh

POLHAUS
Howd she take it

SPADE
(shaking his head)
I dont know anything about women

POLHAUS
(softly)
Since when dont you

The Lieutenant puts his hand on his knees leans forward
fixes eyes on Spade in a peculiarly rigid stare as if their
focus were a matter of mechanics -- to be changed by
pulling a lever

DUNDY
What kind of gun do you carry
SPADE
(easily)
None I dont like them much
Of course there are some at the
office
DUNDY
You dont happen to have one
here
Spade shakes his head
DUNDY

You sure of that

SPADE
Look around
(smiling he waves
his empty glass)
Turn the dump upside-down if you
want I wont squawk -- if youve
got a search warrant

Polhaus shifts his seat on the sofa again blows a deep
breath out through his nose

POLHAUS
(plaintively)
Were not wanting to make any
trouble Sam

SPADE
(ignoring Polhaus --
to Dundy)
I dont like this What are you
sucking around for Tell me or
get out
(he rises)

POLHAUS
(pleading)
You cant treat us that way Sam
It aint right We got our work
to do

Dundy jumps up stands close to Spade thrusts his square
face up to the taller mans

DUNDY

Why were you tailing Thursby
SPADE

I wasnt Miles was For the

swell reason that we had a client
who was paying good United States
money to have him tailed

DUNDY
Whos the client

SPADE
Sorry cant tell you that

POLHAUS
(begging)
Be reasonable Sam Give us a
chance How can we turn up
anything on Miles killing if you
wont tell us what youve got

DUNDY
Tom says you were in too much
of a hurry to even stop for a
look at your dead partner

Polhaus growls something hangs his head

DUNDY
And you didnt go to Archers
house to tell his wife We
called up and the girl in your
office was there and she said
you told her to go

Spades face is stupid in its calmness

DUNDY
I give you ten minutes to get
to a phone and do your talking
to the girl I give you ten
minutes to get to Thursbys

joint -- Geary near Leavenworth --
you could do it easily in that
time

SPADE

(to Polhaus)
Whats your boy friend getting
at Tom

DUNDY

Just this

(he taps Spades

chest with the

knuckles of two

bent fingers)
Thursby was shot down in front
of his hotel about half an hour
after you left Bush Street

SPADE
(separating his words)
Keep -- your -- paws -- off -- me

DUNDY
(his eyes are pale
disks)
What time did you get home

Spade searches for his tobacco and papers starts making a
cigarette

SPADE
(candidly)
I came in just a few minutes ahead
of you I was walking around

thinking things over

DUNDY
We knew you werent here We tried
to get you on the phone Whered

SPADE
(licks his cigarette)
Out Bush Street a way

DUNDY
See anybody that

SPADE
No -- no witnesses

(he laughs pleasantly)
Sit down Dundy You havent
finished your drink

(to Polhaus)
Another one Tom

POLHAUS
No thanks Sam

Dundy sits down but pays no attention to the glass Spade
fills his won glass drinks Then himself sits down again
on the side of the bed

SPADE

I know where I stand now

(he looks with

friendly eyes

from one man

to the other)
Sorry I got up on my hind legs but
you birds trying to rope me made me
nervous Miles getting knocked off
bothered me and then you birds
cracking foxy Thats all right now
though -- now that I know what
youre up to

POLHAUS
Forget it

SPADE

POLHAUS

SPADE

POLHAUS
(grunts disgustedly --
then )
He was shot four times in the back
with a 44 or 45 from across the
street Nobody saw it but thats
the way if figures

SPADE
Hotel people know anything about
him
POLHAUS
Nothing except hed been there a
week
SPADE
Alone
POLHAUS
(nods )
Alone
SPADE
(makes a careless
gesture with his
cigarette)
Did you find out who he was
What his game was Did you
DUNDY

We thought you could tell us that

Spade regards the Lieutenant with eyes that hold an
exaggerated amount of candor

SPADE
Ive never seen Thursby -- dead or
alive

Dundy gets up again His lower lip pushes the words out

DUNDY

You know me Spade If you did it
or you didnt youll get a square
deal out of me and most of the
breaks I dont know that Id blame
you a lot -- the man that killed
your partner

(his eyes become

hard as pebbles)
But that wouldnt keep me from
nailing you

SPADE
(evenly)
Fair enough but Id feel better
about it if youd have a drink
with me

Spade pours Bacardi into the three glasses gives one to
each of the detectives then raises his own

SPADE
Success to crime

Dundy barely touches his lips to the glass puts it down
and starts out Polhaus drinks his off puts his hand out
awkwardly Spade shakes the hand Then Polhaus follows
his superior into the vestibule and the hall As Spade
starts to undress --

out her arms and raising her face for his kiss After the
kiss he makes a little movement as if to release her but
she presses her face to his chest and begins sobbing
Spade strokes her shoulder saying

SPADE
Poor darling

His voice is tender but his eyes on the desk across the
room from his own -- the desk that had been his partners
-- are angry He turns his chin aside to avoid contact
with the crown of her hat

Yes I think so Oh Sam

Spades teeth show in an impatient grimace He bends his
head for a surreptitious look at the watch on his wrist
The woman stirs in his arms raises her face Her eyes are
wet round white-ringed Her mouth is moist

IVA
Oh Sam
(she moans)
Did you kill him

Spade takes his arms from around her steps back stares at
her with bulging eyes his bony jaw hanging loose She
keeps her arms ups as he left them Anguish clouds her
eyes Her soft damp red lips tremble

Spade laughs -- a harsh syllable goes to the window
stands there looking out until she starts towards him
Then he turns quickly goes to his desk sits down and
looks at her with eyes that glitter between narrow lids

SPADE
(coldly)
Who put that idea in your head

IVA
I thought

She lifts a hand to her mouth and fresh tears come to her
eyes She moves with easy sure-footed grace to a place
beside the desk

IVA
(humbly )
Be kind to me Sam

He laughs again his eyes still glittering

SPADE
You killed my husband Sam Be
kind to me
(he claps his
hands together)

Iva begins to cry audibly Spades jaw muscles bulge then
he takes a deep breath makes his face expressionless gets
up goes around the desk to stand behind her put his arms
around her

SPADE

(softly)
Now dont Iva dont

(he puts his

mouth to her ear

and whispers)
You shouldnt have come here today
darling You ought to be home

Iva turns around in his arms to face him

IVA
Youll come soon

SPADE
As soon as I can
(he leads her
to the door
opens it)
Goodbye Iva

He bows her out shuts the door returns to his desk He
takes tobacco and cigarette papers from this vest pocket
but does not roll a cigarette He sits holding the papers
in one hand tobacco in the other and looks with brooding
eyes at his dead partners desk Presently Effie Perine
opens the door comes in

EFFIE
(quietly)
Well

Spade says nothing His brooding gaze does not move from
his dead partners desk

EFFIE
(in a louder voice)
How did you and the widow make out

SPADE
(only his lips move)
She thinks I shot Miles

EFFIE
So you could marry her

Spade makes no reply to that The girl leans over takes
the papers and the tobacco sack

SPADE
The police think I shot Thursby
the guy Miles was tailing for the
Wonderly girl -- Who do you think I
shot

Effies thin fingers shape the cigarette She licks it
smoothes it bites the end and places it between Spades
fingers

SPADE
Thanks honey

He puts an arm around her slim waist rests his cheek
wearily against her hip
EFFIE
Are you going to marry Iva
(she snaps his
desk lighter)

SPADE
Dont be silly
(he puts the
end of his
cigarette to
the flame)
I wish I had never laid eyes on her

EFFIE

Maybe you do now

(a trace of

spitefulness

comes into her

voice -- leans

over for a view

of his face)
Do you suppose she could have killed
him

Spade sits up straight takes his arm from her waist
smiles at her

SPADE
(tenderly -- through
the smoke)
Youre an angel a nice rattle-
brained angel

EFFIE
(wryly)
Oh am I Suppose I told you that
your Iva hadnt been home many
minutes when I arrived to break the
news at three oclock this morning

Spades eyes are immediately alert

SPADE
Are you telling me

EFFIE

(nods )
She kept me waiting at the door
while she undressed Her clothes
were on a chair where she had dumped
them -- hat and coat underneath
Her singlet on top was still warm
She had wrinkled up the bed but the
wrinkles werent mashed down

SPADE
(pats Effies hand)
Youre a detective darling but
(shaking his head)
She didnt kill him

EFFIE
Do the police really think you shot
this what s-his-name

He brushes the ashes off his cigarette

EFFIE
(insisting)
Do they
Spade shrugs
EFFIE

Look at me Sam
He obeys with elaborate seriousness

EFFIE
You worry me You always think you
know what youre doing but youre
too slick for your own good and
some day youre going to find it out

Spade grins mockingly at her The telephone RINGS

takes up the receiver

EFFIE
(into the phone)

Wonderly
Spade takes the phone from her hand

SPADE

Spade sets down the phone and puts on his hat

SPADE

He turns to the door hesitates then goes back to the
desk picks up the slip of paper on which the address is
written takes out his lighter snaps on the flame and
sets fire to the slip of paper He holds it until all but
one corner is curling black ash then drops it on the

timid voice)
Come in Mr Spade

INT LIVING ROOM

Several bags stand open on the floor Miss Wonderly and
Spade enter from the hall

MISS WONDERLY
Everything is upside-down I havent
even finished unpacking

She lays his hat on a table sits down on a walnut settee
Spade sits on a brocaded oval-backed chair facing her
She looks at her fingers working them together Then

MISS WONDERLY
Mr Spade Ive a terrible terrible
confession to make

He makes a polite smile

MISS WONDERLY
That -- that story I told you
yesterday was all -- a story
(she stammers
looks at him
with miserable
frightened eyes)

SPADE
Oh that
(lightly)
We didnt exactly believe your story
Miss -- Miss -- is your name Wonderly

or Leblanc

MISS WONDERLY
(working her fingers again)
Its really OShaughnessy -- Brigid
OShaughnessy

SPADE
We didnt exactly believe your story
Miss OShaughnessy We believed your
two hundred dollars

BRIGID
You mean

SPADE
I mean that you paid us more than
if you had been telling us the

truth
(blandly)
»e-and enough more to make it all
right
BRIGID

(bites her lip)
Mr Spade tell me
(her face becomes
haggard eyes
desperate)
Am I to blame -- for last night
SPADE

You warned us that Thursby was
dangerous Of course you lied
to us about your sister and all --
but that doesnt count We didnt
believe you

(he shrugs his sloping

shoulders )
I wouldnt say it was your fault

BRIGID
(very softly)
Thank you
(she puts her hand
to her breast)

Mr Archer was so -- so alive
yesterday so solid and hearty
and
SPADE
(sharply)

Stop it He knew what he was
doing Those are the chances

we take
BRIGID
Was -- was he married
SPADE

Yes with ten thousand insurance
no children and a wife who didnt
like him

BRIGID
Oh please dont

SPADE
(shrugging again)
Thats the way it was

He glances at his watch gets up

SPADE

Anyway theres no time for worrying
about that now

(nods his head toward

the window)
Out there a flock of policemen and
assistant district attorneys are
running around with their noses to
the ground

Brigid moves over on the sofa making a place for him
beside her -- but Spade remains standing

BRIGID
(her voice thin
and tremulous)
Mr Spade do they know about me

SPADE
Not yet Ive been stalling them
until I could see you

BRIGID
Must they know about me at all
Mr Spade Couldnt you somehow
manage to shield me from them
So I wont have to answer their
questions

SPADE
Maybe But Ill have to know what
its all about

She rises puts a timid hand to his coat sleeve

BRIGID
I cant tell you -- I cant tell
you now -- later I will -- when I

can You must trust me Mr Spade
Oh Im so alone and afraid
Ive got nobody to help me if
you wont help me

(begging)
Be generous Mr Spade Youre
strong Youre brave You can
spare me some of that strength
and courage surely

(she drops to her

knees her hand

touching his clings

pitifully)
Help me Mr Spade I need help
so badly Ive no right to ask
you but I do ask you Help me

Spade empties his lungs with a long sighing exhalation

SPADE
You wont need much of anybodys
help Youre good Its chiefly
your eyes I think and that throb
you get in your voice when you
say things like Be generous
Mr Spade

She jumps to her feet Her face blanching painfully but
she holds her head erect and she looks Spade straight in
the eye

BRIGID

(voice chilled)
I deserve that But -- Oh -- the
lie was in the way I said it and
not at all in what I said

(lips trembling

slightly but

head still erect)
Its my own fault that you cant
believe me now

Spades face darkens He looks down at the floor
SPADE
(muttering)

Now you are dangerous

Brigid OShaughnessy goes to the table picks up his hat
She comes back and stands in front of him holding the hat
for him to take if he wishes Her face is thin haggard

SPADE

(looking at his hat)
Ive got nothing against trusting
you blindly except that I wont
be able to do you much good if I
havent some idea of what its all
about For instance Ive got to
have some sort of line on your
Floyd Thursby

She puts his hat on the table slips down onto the settee
again

BRIGID

I met him in the Orient

(tracing with

pointed fingers

a figure eight

on a sofa pillow)
We came here from Hong Kong last
week He had promised to help me
He took advantage of my dependence
on him to betray me

SPADE
Betray you how

Brigid OShaughnessy shakes her head and says nothing
SPADE
(taking a new tack)
Why did you want him shadowed

BRIGID
I wanted to learn how far he had
gone whom he was meeting Things
like that

SPADE
Did he kill Archer

BRIGID
(surprised)
Yes certainly

SPADE
He had a Luger in his shoulder
holster Archer wasnt killed
with a Luger

BRIGID
Floyd always carried an extra
revolver in his overcoat pocket

SPADE
Why all the guns

BRIGID
He lived by them The story in
Hong Kong is that he first came to
the Orient as bodyguard to a gambler
who had to leave the States -- that
the gambler had since disappeared
and that Floyd knew about his
disappearance I don know I do
know that he always went heavily
armed and that he never went to
sleep without covering the floor
around his bed with crumpled
newspapers so nobody could come
silently into his room

SPADE
You picked a nice sort of playmate

BRIGID
(simply)
Only that sort could have helped me
-- if he had been loyal

SPADE
(pinching his lower
lip between finger
and thumb)
How bad a hole are you actually in

BRIGID
(the chill coming
back into her voice)
As bad as could be

SPADE
Physical danger
BRIGID
Im not heroic I dont think there

is anything worse than death

SPADE
Then its that

BRIGID
Its that as surely as were sitting
here
(she shivers)
--unless you help me

Spade releases his lower lip runs his fingers through his
hair

SPADE
Who killed Thursby Your enemies or
his

Brigid puts a crumpled handkerchief to her mouth speaks
through it

BRIGID
I dont know His I suppose
But Im afraid I dont know

Spade makes a growling animal noise in his throat

SPADE
This is hopeless I dont know
what you want done I dont even

know if you know what you want
(he reaches for his hat)

BRIGID
(begging ina
somewhat choked
voice)
You wont go to the police

SPADE

(his voice loud with rage)
Go to them

(puts his hat on

his head pulling

it down tightly)
All Ive got to do is stand still
and theyll be swarming all over
me Well Ill tell them all I
know and youll have to take your
chances

The girl rises from the settee and stands very straight in
front of him holding her white panic-stricken face high
though she cannot hold the twitching muscles of mouth and
chin still

BRIGID
Youve been patient Youve tried
to help me Its hopeless and
useless I suppose
(she stretches
out her right

hand)
I thank you for what you have done
I -- Ill have to take my chances

Spade makes the growling animal noise in his throat again
Then

SPADE
(abruptly )
How much money have you got

The question startles her

BRIGID
(reluctantly)
Ive about five hundred dollars left

SPADE
Give it to me

She hesitates looking timidly at him He makes an angry
gesture She goes into her bedroom returning almost
immediately with a sheaf of paper in one hand He takes
the money from her counts it Then

SPADE
(scowling)
Theres only four hundred here

BRIGID
(meekly)
I had to keep some to live on
(she raises a hand
to her breast)

SPADE
(brutally)
Cant you get any more
BRIGID
No
SPADE

You must have something you can
raise money on

BRIGID
Ive some rings -- a little jewelry

SPADE
Youll have to hock them
(he holds out his hand)

Brigid looks pleadingly at him His eyes are hard and
implacable Slowly she puts her hand into the neck of her
dress brings out a slender roll of bills gives them to
him He smoothes the bills out counts them gives her
back two of the five bills puts the others in his pocket

SPADE

Ill be back as soon as I can
with the best news I can manage
Ill ring four times -- long-
short-long-short -- so youll
know its me You neednt come
to the door with me I can let
myself out

Effie with arched brows

EFFIE
(nods )
Gardenia

SPADE
Quick In with him darling

She goes to the door opens it

EFFIE
Will you come in Mr Cairo

Cairo comes in and she goes out Mr Joel Cairo is a
small-boned dark man of medium height His hair is black
and smooth and very glossy A square-cut ruby surrounded
by baguette diamonds gleams against his dark cravat His
black coat cut tight to narrow shoulders flares a little
over plump hips His trousers fit his legs more snugly
than the current fashion The uppers of his patent leather
shoes are hidden by fawn spats He holds a black derby hat
in a chamois-gloved hand and he comes toward Spade with
short mincing bobbing steps Spade inclines his head at
his visitor and then at a chair

SPADE
Sit down Mr Cairo

Cairo bows elaborately over his hat

CAIRO
I thank you

He sits down primly placing his hat on his knees and
begins to draw off his chamois gloves

SPADE
(precisely as he
addressed the same
question to Brigid
OShaughnessy when
she first appeared)
Now what can I do for you Mr
Cairo

Cairo turns his hat over drops his gloves into it and
places it bottom up on the corner of the desk Diamonds
twinkle on the second and third fingers of his left hand
A ruby surrounded by diamonds like the one in his cravat
is on the third finger of his right hand Cairo rubs his
palms together then in a high-pitched thin voice

CAIRO
May a stranger offer condolences
for your partners unfortunate
death

SPADE
Thanks

CAIRO
May I ask Mr Spade if there is
as the newspapers infer a certain
-- ah -- relationship between that
unfortunate happening and the death
a little later of the man Thursby

Spade does not reply When it is obvious to Cairo that
Spade does not mean to answer he rises and bows

CAIRO
(punctiliously)
I beg your pardon

He sits down and puts his hands side-by-side flat on the
corner of the desk

CAIRO
More than idle curiosity prompted my
question Mr Spade I am trying to
recover an -- ah -- ornament that
has been shall we say mislaid I
thought and hoped you could assist
me

Spade nods once briefly

CAIRO
The ornament is a statuette -- the
black figure of a bird

Spade nods as before

CAIRO
I am prepared to pay on behalf of
the figures rightful owner the sum
of five thousand dollars for its
recovery

He raises one hand from the desk corner and touches a spot
in the air ever so lightly with his fore-finger

CAIRO
I am prepared to promise that --
what is the phrase -- No questions

will be asked
(he puts his hand
back on the desk
beside the other
and smiles blandly)

SPADE
(thoughtfully)
Five thousand dollars is a lot of
money

OVER SCENE there is a light rapping on the door

SPADE
(calls)
Come in

The door opens enough to admit Effie Perines head and
shoulders She is wearing a small dark felt hat anda
dark coat with a gray fur collar

EFFIE
Is there anything else

SPADE
No Goodnight Lock the door when
you go will you

EFFIE
Goodnight

She disappears behind the closing door Spade turns in his
chair to face Cairo again

SPADE
Its an interesting figure

The SOUND of the corridor door closing comes OVER scene
Smiling Cairo takes a short compact flat black pistol
out of an inner pocket

CAIRO
You will please clasp your hands
together at the back of your neck

Spade raises his arms leaning back in his chair
intertwining the fingers of his two hands behind his head
His eyes holding no particular expression remain focused
on Cairos dark face Cairo coughs a little apologetic
cough smiles nervously His dark eyes are humid and
bashful and very earnest

CAIRO
I intend to search your offices
Mr Spade I warn you that if you
attempt to prevent me I shall
certainly shoot you

SPADE
(in a voice as empty
of expression as
his face)
Go ahead

CAIRO
You will please stand I shall have
to make sure you are not armed

Spade gets up pushing his chair back with his calves as he
straightens his legs Cairo comes around behind him He
transfers the pistol from his right hand to his left He
lifts Spades coat-tail looks under it Holding the
pistol close to Spades back he puts his right hand around
Spades side pats his chest His face is no more than six
inches below and behind Spades right elbow

Spades elbow drops as Spade spins to the right Cairos
face jerks back but not far enough Spades right heel on
the patent-leathered toe anchors the smaller man to the
elbows path The elbow strikes him beneath the
cheek-bone

Spades right hand closes on the pistol Cairo lets the
pistol go the instant Spades fingers touch it Spade
makes an about-face With his left hand he gathers
together the smaller mans coat lapels while his right hand
stows the captured weapon away in a coat pocket His face
is wooden with a trace of sullenness around the mouth

Spade by means of his grip on Cairos lapels turns him
slowly pushes him back until he is standing close in front
of the chair he lately occupied A puzzled look replaces
the look of pain and chagrin on Cairos face

Spade smiles His smile is gentle even dreamy His right
shoulder raises a few inches Then his fist strikes the
edge of Cairos jaw-bone Cairo shuts his eyes and is
unconscious

Spade lowers the limp body into the chair where it lies
with sprawled arms and legs the head lolling back the
mouth open Spade empties the unconscious mans pockets
one by one working methodically making a pile of the
pockets contents on the desk When the last pocket has
been turned out he returns to his chair rolls and lights
a cigarette and begins to examine his spoils

CLOSEUP - SPOILS

Spades fingers open the wallet It contains several
hundred dollars in United States bills two five-pound
notes three much-used Greek passports bearing Cairos name
and portrait five folded sheets of onion-skin paper
covered with what looks like Arabic writing a thin sheaf
of Mr Joel Cairos engraved cards and a ticket for an
orchestra seat at the Geary Theatre

Besides the wallet and its contents a wafer-thin platinum
watch a handful of United States British French and
Chinese coins a package of violet pastille and a large
silk handkerchief with a florid design

CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AND CAIRO

Spade takes the unconscious mans wrist between finger and
thumb Then after a moment he rocks back in his chair
and smokes his cigarette Cairo moans flutters his
eyelids presently Several moments pass before the eyes
remain open and several more moments before they focus
properly Then he raises his head from the back of the
chair looks around the office in confusion sees Spade
and sits up There is a dark bruise where Spades fist
struck him

SPADE
Sorry
(he grins wolfishly)
But imagine my embarrassment when
I found that five thousand dollar
offer was just hooey

CAIRO
(through his teeth --
painfully)
Youre mistaken Mr Spade That
was and is a genuine offer

SPADE
(his surprise is genuine)
What the hell

CAIRO

I am prepared to pay five thousand
dollars for the figures return

(he takes his

hand away from

the bruised head

prim and business-

like again)
You have it

SPADE

CAIRO
(politely skeptical)
If it is not here why did you risk
serious injury to prevent my
searching for it

SPADE
I should sit around and let people
come in and stick me up

CAIRO
Surely it is natural enough that I
should first try to spare the owner
such a considerable expense if
possible

SPADE
Who is he

CAIRO
(smiling demurely)
You will have to forgive my not
answering that question

SPADE
(blinking his eyes
sleepily)
It might be better all around if we
put our cards on the table

CAIRO

(his voice suave)
I do not think it would be better
If you know more than I I shall
profit by your knowledge and so will
you to the extent of five thousand
dollars If you do not then I have
made a mistake in coming to you and
to do as you suggest would be simply
to make that mistake worse

Spade nods indifferently waves a hand at the articles on

the desk

SPADE
Theres nothing like five thousand
dollars there

CAIRO
You wish some assurance of my
sincerity A retainer Would
that serve

SPADE
It might

Cairo puts his hand out toward his wallet hesitates
withdraws his hand

CAIRO
You will take say one hundred
dollars

Spade picks up the wallet takes out bills

SPADE

(frowning)
Better make it two hundred

(he does make it

two hundred then

rocks back in

his chair again)
Your first guess was that I had the
bird

(shakes his head)
Theres nothing to that Whats your
second guess

CAIRO
That you know where it is Or at
least that you know it is where
you can get it

SPADE

(his face solemn

except for wrinkles

at the corners of

his eyes)
Youre not hiring me to do any
murders or burglaries for you but
simply to get it back if possible
in an honest lawful way

CAIRO

(also solemn-faced)
If possible And in any event with
discretion

(he puts his bills

back into his

pockets then he

picks up his hat)
I am at the Hotel Belvedere when you
wish to communicate with me -- Room
635 I confidently expect the
greatest mutual benefit from our
association Mr Spade

(he hesitates)
May I have my pistol

SPADE
Sure Id forgotten it

Spade takes the pistol out of his coat pocket hands it to
Cairo Cairo points the pistol at Spades chest

CAIRO
(earnestly)
You will please keep your hands on
top of the desk I intend to search
your office

SPADE
Well Ill be
(then he laughs
in his throat)
All right -- go ahead I wont stop
you

Spade looking on smiles pleasantly as Cairo moves quickly
to his task Drawers and filing cabinets are opened He
looks behind curtains and under the seats of the three
office chairs and into the wastebasket He even opens the
window and looks along the lighted window ledge Finding
nothing he sighs a little sigh of disappointment Then
turning back to Spade he bows politely

CAIRO
Thank you very much Mr Spade
I shall await your call

And he is gone Among other things that Cairos search
uncovers is a bottle of Bacardi Spade reaches for it
fills a lily cup two-thirds full drinks

SPADE
(to himself)
Anyway theyre paying for it

He fills the cup again drinks returns the bottle to the
drawer then rising puts on his hat and overcoat and
starts turning off the lights

Brigid sighs happily sits on the walnut settee her face
relaxed and her body relaxed She smiles up at him with
admiring eyes then at another thought the admiration goes
out of her eyes and the anxious worried look returns

(voice hushed almost
to a whisper)

I havent lived a good life Ive

been bad -- worse than you could know
SPADE

Thats good Because if you

actually were as innocent as you

seemed to be wed never get

anywhere

BRIGID
I wont be innocent

SPADE
Good
(then in the
manner of one
making polite
conversation)
I saw Joel Cairo tonight

Brigids eyes focused on his profile become frightened

then cautious Spades legs are stretched out and he is
looking at his crossed feet His face has a blank
expression
BRIGID
(uneasily)
You -- you know him
SPADE

(maintaining his light
conversational tone)
Only slightly

She gets up from the settee goes to the fireplace to poke

at the fire She changes the position of an ornament on

the mantelpiece crosses the room to get a box of

cigarettes from a table in the corner
curtain and returns to her seat

SPADE
(grins sideways at her)

straightens a

Youre good Youre very good

BRIGID
What did he say

SPADE
About what

BRIGID
(hesitatingly)
About me
SPADE
Nothing

(he turns to hold his
lighter under the end
of her cigarette)

BRIGID
Well what did he talk about
(with half playful
petulance)

SPADE
He offered me five thousand dollars
for the black bird

Brigid starts throws a swift alarmed look at Spade then
rises again

SPADE
Youre not going to go around poking
at the fire and straightening the
room again are you
(he laughs lazily)

Brigids laughter mingles with his She drops her
cigarette into a tray and looks at him with clear merry
eyes

BRIGID

No I wont and what did you say
SPADE

Five thousand dollars is a lot of

money

She smiles but instead of smiling too he looks gravely at
her Her smile becomes faint confused Then she stops
smiling lifts her shoulders and hands and lets them fall
in a gesture that accepts defeat

BRIGID
It is It is far more than I could
ever offer you if I must bid for
your loyalty

Spade laughs His laughter is brief and somewhat bitter

SPADE
Thats good -- coming from you
What have you given me besides
money Have you given me any of
your confidence Any of the truth
Havent you tried to buy my loyalty
with money and nothing else
BRIGID

Ive given you all the money I have

(tears glisten

in her eyes

her voice is

hoarse vibrant)
Ive thrown myself on your mercy --
told you that without your help Im
utterly lost

(she turns on

him suddenly --

cries ina

vibrant voice)
What else is there that I can buy
you with

Spade takes her face between his hands kisses her mouth
roughly and contemptuously then releasing her he sits
back She sits holding her face where his hands left it
Spade gets up takes two steps towards the fireplace
halts Brigid doesnt move He turns to face her

SPADE
I dont care what your secrets are
-- but I cant go ahead without more
confidence in you than I have now
Youve got to convince me that you
know what its all about -- that you
arent simply fiddling along hoping
itll all come out right in the end

BRIGID
Cant you trust me a little longer

SPADE
How much is a little And what are
you waiting for

She bites her lip looks down
BRIGID

(almost inaudibly)
I must talk to Joel Cairo

SPADE
You can see him tonight
(looks at his watch)
Hes at the theatre Itll be out
soon Ill call his hotel
(crosses room --
picks up telephone)

BRIGID
(eyes alarmed)
But he cant come here I cant let
him know where I am Im afraid

SPADE
(dials a number)
My place then

She hesitates working her lips together

BRIGID
(finally)
All right
SPADE

(into phone)
I want to leave a message for Mr
Joel Cairo

INT HALL

as Spade opens the door on Joel Cairo Cairos dark eyes
seem all irises and his high-pitched thin-voiced words
start tumbling out as he enters

CAIRO
There is a boy outside who seems
to be watching the house Mr Spade

SPADE
I know I spotted him

The girl comes into the passageway behind Spade
BRIGID

(anxiously)
What boy What is that

SPADE
(unconcerned )
I dont know -- a kid -- hes been
tailing me around town all evening
Come on in Cairo

Brigid grasps Sams arm above the elbow tensely

BRIGID
(breathlessly)
Did he follow you to my apartment

SPADE
No I shook him before that

She breathes again
47 INT LIVING ROOM - SPADES APARTMENT

as Spade leads the way in Cairo holding his black hat to
his belly with both hands bows stiffly

CAIRO
Im delighted to see you again
Miss OShaughnessy

BRIGID
(offering him her hand)
I was sure you would be Joel

He takes her hand makes another formal bow over it then
releases it quickly She goes to the padded rocker she had
occupied before Cairo takes the armchair by the table
Spade after hanging Cairos hat and coat up sits on the
edge of the sofa in front of the window begins to roll a
cigarette

BRIGID
(to Cairo)
Mr Spade told me about your offer
for the Falcon How soon can you
have the money ready

CAIRO
(eyebrows twitching)
It is ready

He smiles showing teeth too white and too even then he
looks at Spade Spade is lighting a cigarette

BRIGID
In cash
CAIRO

(primly)
Oh yes

BRIGID
You are ready to give us five
thousand dollars if we turn over
the Falcon to you

CAIRO

(holding up a

wriggling hand)
Excuse me I expressed myself badly
I did not mean to say that I have
the money in my pocket but that I am
prepared to get it on a few minutes
notice at any time during banking
hours

BRIGID
Oh

SPADE
(grins wolfishly
through smoke)
Thats probably right He had only
a few hundred in his wallet when I
frisked him this afternoon

Brigids eyes open wide

CAIRO
(trying and failing
to keep eagerness
out of his voice)
I shall be able to give you the
money at say half-past ten in the
morning

BRIGID
But I havent got the Falcon

Cairo puts a hand on either arm of his chair holds his
small-boned body erect and stiff

BRIGID
(quickly)
Ill have it in another week at the
most though

CAIRO
(with bitter skepticism)
Where is it

BRIGID
Where Floyd hid it

CAIRO
Floyd Thursby

She nods

CAIRO
And you know where he hid it

She nods again

CAIRO
Then why must we wait a week

BRIGID
Perhaps not a whole week

Cairo rubs the back of one hand with the palm of the other
His lids lower to shade his eyes

CAIRO
Why if I may ask another question
are you willing to sell it to me

BRIGID
Im afraid -- after what happened
to Floyd Im afraid to touch it
except to turn it over to somebody
else right away

If Spade feels either excitement or curiosity he does not
betray it Lounging on the sofa he takes an occasional
drag at his cigarette between occasional sips of rum

CAIRO
(leaning forward --
his voice low)
Exactly what did happen to Floyd

BRIGID
The fat man

CAIRO
(clicks his pearly teeth)
Is he here

BRIGID
I dont know I suppose so What
difference does it make

Cairo rearranges his hand in his lap so that intentionally
or not a forefinger points at Spade

CAIRO
It might make a world of difference

The girl glances at the pointed finger makes an impatient
motion with her head

BRIGID
-Or me or you
CAIRO
Precisely And shall we add more

certainly the boy outside

BRIGID
Yes
(laughs )
But you might be able to get around
him Joel as you did that one in
Istanbul -- What was his name

Cairos face is suddenly distorted He cries in a shrill
enraged voice

CAIRO
You mean the one you couldnt get
to come to

Before he can finish Brigid is out of her chair As Cairo
starts to rise her right hand goes out cracks sharply
against his cheek Cairo grunts raises his hand to strike
back

Spade wooden of face is up from the sofa by now and close
to them He catches Cairo by the throat chokes him

Cairo gurgles puts a hand inside his coat Spade grasps
the Greeks wrist twists it until the fingers open and the
black pistol drops to the rug Brigid quickly picks up the
pistol

CAIRO
(hoarsely )
This is the second time youve put
your hands on me

Cairos eyes bulge slightly as Spade tightens the throttling
pressure on his throat

SPADE
(growling)
Yes -- and when youre slapped
youll take it and like it

He releases Cairos wrist and with a thick open hand
strikes the side of his face three times savagely Cairo
tries to spit in his face Spade slaps him again across
the mouth

OVER SCENE the buzzer sounds Cairos eyes jerk to the
passageway that leads to the corridor door The girl gasps
and turns to face the passageway Spade stares gloomily
for a moment at the blood trickling from Cairos lip then
steps back taking his hand from the Greeks throat

Brigid comes close to Spade whispers

BRIGID
Who is it

Cairos eyes jerk back from the passageway to Spade and ask
the same question

SPADE
(irritably)
I dont know

The buzzer sounds again more insistently

SPADE
Well keep quiet

CAMERA TROLLIES ahead of him as he enters the passageway
shutting the door behind him

CLOSE SHOT - ON CORRIDOR DOOR

as Spade opens it Lieutenant Dundy and Tom Polhaus stand
there

SPADE
(good-naturedly )
Hello You guys pick swell hours
to do your visiting in What is
it this time

DUNDY
(quietly)
We want to talk to you Spade
Spade remains in the doorway blocking it

SPADE
Go ahead and talk

POLHAUS
We dont have to do it out here
in the hall do we

SPADE
(in a slightly
apologetic tone)
You cant come in

POLHAUS
(putting his big
hand playfully
on Spades chest)
Come off it Sam

Spade braces himself against the hand grins wolfishly

SPADE
Going to strong-arm me Tom

POLHAUS
(grumbling)
Be reasonable Sam

DUNDY
(through his teeth)
Itd pay you to play along with
us a little Spade You got away
with this and you got away with

that -- but you cant keep it up
forever
SPADE
(arrogantly)

Stop me when you can

DUNDY
Thats what I intend to do

He puts his hands behind him thrusts his hard face up
towards Spades

DUNDY
Theres talk going around about you
and Archers wife Anything to it

SPADE
Not anything

DUNDY
The talk is that she tried to get
a divorce out of him so she could
put in with you but he wouldnt
give it to her Anything to that

SPADE
No

DUNDY
(stolidly)
Theres even talk that thats why
he was put on the spot

SPADE
Dont be a hog Dundy Your first
idea that I killed Thursby off
because he killed Miles falls to
pieces if you blame me for killing
Miles too

DUNDY
You havent heard me say you killed
anybody Youre the one who keeps
bringing that up

SPADE
Havent you anything better to do
than popping in here early every
morning with a lot of fool
questions

DUNDY
(adds deliberately)
-- And get lying answers

SPADE
(warningly)
Take it easy

Dundy looks him up and down then straight in the eye

DUNDY
If you say there was nothing between
you and Archers wife youre a liar
and Im telling you so

SPADE
(moistening his lips)
Is that the hot tip that brought you
here at this ungodly time of night

DUNDY
Thats one of them

SPADE
And the other

DUNDY
(in a cold level voice)
Let us in

Spade frowns hakes his head

DUNDY
(starts buttoning
his overcoat)
All right Spade well see Maybe
youre right in bucking us Think
it over

OVER SCENE Joel Cairos voice high and thin cries

CAIROS VOICE
(over scene)
Help Police Help

Dundy who was turning away confronts Spade again OVER
SCENE the SOUND of a brief struggle of a blow of a
subdued cry

DUNDY
(decisively)
I guess were going in

SPADE
I guess you are

Dundy and Polhaus push past him into the passageway
CAMERA TROLLIES after them as they open the door to the
living room enter

INT LIVING ROOM

Brigid OShaughnessy is huddled in an armchair by the
table her arms over her face Her eyes are white-
circled terrified Joel Cairo stands in front of her
bending over her holding in one hand the flat black
pistol His other hand is clapped to his forehead Blood
runs through the fingers of that hand and down into his
eyes

Cairo does not heed the detectives He is glaring at the
girl huddled in front of him His lips are working
spasmodically but no coherent sound comes from between
them Dundy the first of the three into the living room
moves swiftly to Cairos side puts a hand on his own hip
under his overcoat and a hand on Cairos wrist

DUNDY
(growling)
What are you up to here

Cairo takes the re-smeared hand from his head flourishes
it

CAIRO
(cries)
This is what she has done Look
at it

Uncovered his forehead shows a three-inch ragged tear

DUNDY
(to the girl)
Did you do that

She looks at Spade with appealing eyes He does not in any
way respond but leans against the door frame with the
polite detached air of a disinterested spectator

BRIGID

(to Dundy -- in

a low throbbing

voice)
I had to I was all alone in here
with him He attacked me I
tried to keep him off I -- I
couldnt make myself shoot him

CAIRO

(cries)
Oh you dirty filthy liar

(facing Dundy)
I came in here in good faith and
was attacked by both of them And
when you came he went out to talk
with you leaving her here with this
pistol And then she said they were
going to kill me after you left --
and I called for help so you wouldnt
leave me here to be murdered And
then she struck me with the pistol

BRIGID
(shrilly)
Make him tell the truth -- why dont
you

She takes two steps to Cairo and Dundy slaps Cairo on the
cheek Cairo yells inarticulately Dundy pushes the girl
back into the chair growls

DUNDY
None of that now

Brigid puts her leg out and kicks Cairo the high heel of
her blue slipper striking him just below the knee Polhaus
comes over to stand close beside her

POLHAUS
(grumbling)
Behave sister Thats no way to

act
Dundy stares at Spade His eyes are hard bright discs

DUNDY
(to Polhaus)
Well Tom dont guess well go
wrong pulling the lot of them in

Polhaus nods gloomily Spade leaves the door advances
to the center of the room dropping his cigarette ina

tray on the table as he passes His smile is amiable

his manner composed

SPADE
Dont be in a hurry boys
Everything can be explained

DUNDY
(sneering)
I bet

Spade bows to the girl

SPADE
Miss OShaughnessy may I present
Lieutenant Dundy and Detective
Sergeant Polhaus
(he bows to Dundy)
Miss OShaughnessy is an operative
in my employ -- since yesterday

CAIRO
(interrupting indignantly)
That isnt so She --

SPADE

(in a loud voice)
This is Mr Joel Cairo an
acquaintance of Thursbys He came
to my office this afternoon to hire
me to find something Thursby was
supposed to have on him when he was
bumped off It looked funny the way
he put it to me so I wouldnt touch
it Then he pulled a gun -- well
never mind that unless it comes to
the point of laying charges against
each other Anyway after talking
it over with Miss OShaughnessy I
thought maybe I could get something
out of him about Miles and Thursbys
killings so I asked him up here
Maybe we put the questions to hima
little rough but he wasnt hurt
enough to cry for help

As Spade talks anxiety comes into Cairos blood-stained
face His eyes move jerkily up and down shifting their
focus uneasily between the floor and Spades bland face

DUNDY
(to Cairo -- brusquely
-- demanding)
Well what have you to say to that

Cairo stares at the Lieutenants face for a long moment
When he lifts his eyes they are sly and wary

CAIRO
(murmurs )
I dont know -- what to say

DUNDY
Try telling the facts

CAIRO
(fidgeting)
The facts

DUNDY
Quit stalling All you gotta do
is swear to a complaint that they
took a poke at you and well throw
them into the can

SPADE
(affably)
Go ahead Cairo Tell him youll
do it -- and then well swear to a

complaint against you and hell
have the lot of us

Cairo clears his throat looks nervously around the room

DUNDY
Get your hats

Spade winks at Cairo broadly crosses to the padded rocker
sits down He laughs

SPADE
(nothing but delight
in his voice)
Well boys and girls we put it
over nicely

DUNDY
(peremptorily)
Get your hats
SPADE
Dont you know when youre being
kidded
DUNDY

(rises moving stiffly)
No but well let that wait till
we get down to the station

SPADE
Wake up -- youre being kidded
When the bell rang I said to Miss
OShaughnessy here and Cairo -- Its

those bulls again Theyre getting
to be nuisances When you hear them
going one of you scream and then
well see how far we can string them
along until they tumble

Brigid OShaughnessy bends forward in her chair laughs
merrily Cairo starts then smiles He holds the smile
fixed on her face

POLHAUS
(grumbling)
Cut it out Sam

DUNDY
(scornfully)
The cut on his head -- whered it
come from
CAIRO
I fell -- we intended to be

struggling for the pistol when you
came in and I tripped on the end of
the rug and fell

DUNDY
Horse Feathers

He pulls Cairo roughly around holding him now by one wrist
and the nape of his neck

DUNDY
Ill take you along for packing the
gun anyway

SPADE
Dont be a sap Dundy The gun was
part of the plant Its one of mine
(he laughs)
Too bad its only a 32 or maybe you
could find it was the one Thursby
and Miles were shot with

Dundy releases Cairo spins on his heel his right fist
clicks on Spades chin The girl utters a short cry
Spades smile flickers out He steadies himself with a
short backward step and his thick sloping shoulders
writhe under his coat Before his fist can come up Tom
Polhaus has pushed himself between the two men

POLHAUS
(begging)
No Sam -- no

After a long moment of motionlessness Spades muscles
relax

SPADE
(sullenly)
Then get him out of here quick

Dundys fists are clenched in front of his body his feet
are planted firm a little apart on the floor

DUNDY
Get their names and addresses

Polhaus turns toward Cairo

CAIRO
(quickly)
Joel Cairo -- Hotel Belvedere
SPADE

Miss OShaughnessys address is
in care of my office

Dundy takes a step forward halting in front of the girl

DUNDY
Where do you live

SPADE
(to Tom -- flinging
the words out)
Get him out of here Ive had
enough of this

POLHAUS
(mumbling)
Take it easy Sam
(buttoning his
coat he turns
to Dundy)
Well is that all

Dundys scowl fails to conceal indecision
CAIRO

(moving suddenly
toward the door)

Im going too -- if Mr Spade will
be kind enough to give me my hat
and coat

SPADE
Whats the hurry

CAIRO
No hurry -- but its quite late

and

Spade goes to the closet in the passageway takes out
Cairos hat and coat hands them to him then to Polhaus

SPADE
Tell him to leave the gun

Dundy takes Cairos Pistol from his overcoat pocket puts
it on the table He goes out first with Cairo at his
heels Polhaus halts in front of Spade

POLHAUS
(mutters )
I hope you know what youre doing
Sam

Getting no response he follows the others out Spade
waits at the door of the passageway until the corridor door
closes then turns back into the room He sits on the
sofa elbows on knees cheeks in hands looking at the
floor Brigid leaves her chair and comes over to the sofa
to sit beside Spade

BRIGID
Youre absolutely the wildest
person Ive ever known Do you
always carry on so high-handed

Spade turns on the sofa to face her

SPADE
Now youve had your talk with Cairo
Now you can talk to me

BRIGID
Oh yes -- of course

She smoothes her dress down over her knees then she frowns
at her knees Spade puts an arm across her back cupping
his hand over the small bare shoulder farthest from him

SPADE
Well Im listening

She turns her head to smile up at him with playful
impudence

BRIGID
Do you need your arm there for that

SPADE
No
(he takes it away)

BRIGID
(murmurs )
Youre altogether unpredictable

SPADE
Im still listening

Brigid wriggles a finger at the alarm clock perched on top
of the book Its clumsy hands say 250

BRIGID
Oh look at the time
(rising)
I must go

SPADE
(shaking his head)
Not until youve told me about it

BRIGID

(gaily)
Am I a prisoner

SPADE
Maybe that kid outside hasnt gone
home yet

BRIGID
(her gaiety vanishes)
Do you think hes still there

SPADE
Its likely

She shivers

SPADE
You can start now

BRIGID
Youre the most insistent person
(sips her drink)

SPADE
Yes and wild and unpredictable
Whats the bird this falcon -- that

everybodys all steamed up about

Brigid studies a small crescent her lips have left on the
brim of the glass Then

BRIGID
Suppose I wouldnt tell you anything
at all about it What would you do
(mockery ripples
in a smile on
her face)
Something wild and unpredictable

SPADE
Maybe

BRIGID

(wrinkles her

pale forehead)
Its a black figure as you know
smooth and shiny of a bird a hawk
or falcon about that high --

(she holds her

hands a foot

apart)

SPADE
What makes it so important

BRIGID
(shakes her head)
I dont know They wouldnt tell
me But they promised me five
hundred pounds if I helped them
get it from the man who had it

SPADE
That was in Istanbul
BRIGID
(hesitates -- then)
Marmora
SPADE
Go ahead
BRIGID

But thats all They promised me
five hundred pounds to help them
and I did And then we found that
Joel Cairo meant to desert us taking
the Falcon with him and leaving
Floyd and me nothing So we did
exactly that to him But then I
wasnt any better off than before
because Floyd hadnt any intention
of keeping his promise to me about
sharing equally I had learned that
by the time we got here

(indignation darkens

her eyes)

SPADE
(scowling at her)
Whats the bird made of

BRIGID
Porcelain or black stone -- I dont
know I only saw it once for a few
minutes Floyd showed it to me when

we first got hold of it

SPADE
(casually)
Your are a liar

She gets up and stands at the end of the table looking
down at him with dark abashed eyes

BRIGID
I ama liar Ive always been a
liar

SPADE

(good-humored1ly )
Dont brag about it Was there any
truth at all in that yarn

BRIGID
(lowers her head
slightly -- whispers)
Some Not very much

Spade rises crosses to her He puts his hand under her
chin lifts her head Her eyes are damp He laughs into
them

SPADE
Weve got all night before us Ill
put some coffee on and well try

again
BRIGID
(her eyelids droop)
Oh -- Im so tired

(then tremulously)
So tired of lying and thinking
up lies and not knowing what is a
lie and what is the truth I wish
I

She puts her hands up to Spades cheeks her mouth hard
against his mouth -- her body flat against his body
Spades arms go around her holding her to him Muscles
bulge his sleeves as his hand cradles her head his fingers
lost among her hair

who is no more than a foot away from the young man stares
openly at him His features are small in keeping with his

is neither new nor of better than ordinary quality Spade
takes out paper and tobacco

SPADE
(casually)
Where is he

LUKE

SPADE
Uh-huh A bad break

He jerks his head toward the boy on the divan

SPADE
What do you let these cheap gunmen
hang out in your lobby for with
their tools bulging in their
clothes

Luke examines the boy with crafty brown eyes set in a
suddenly hard face

LUKE
(to boy)
What do you want here

The boy rises looks at the necktie of the two men -- from
one to the other He looks like a school boy standing in
front of them

LUKE
(belligerently)
Well if you dont want anything

He walks away from them toward the swinging door Spade
removes his hat wipes his damp forehead with a
handkerchief

Good morning

CAIRO

Please excuse me Our private
conversations have not been such

Pardon my speaking bluntly but it

What else could I do I had to
throw in with her I dont know

SPADE

How long did they work on you

CAIRO
(pain and indignation
mix in face and voice)
Until a very little while ago

SPADE
What did they get out of you

CAIRO

(primly)
Not a single thing I adhered to
the course you indicated earlier
in your rooms I certainly wish
you had devised a more reasonable
story I felt distinctly ridiculous
repeating it

SPADE
(grins)
Dont worry about the storys
goofiness A sensible one would

have had us all in the cooler You
sure you didnt give them anything

Hello honey

Iva stands just inside the door wadding a black-bordered
handkerchief in her small gloved hands peering into his
face with frightened red and swollen eyes

IVA
(in a choked voice)
Oh Sam Forgive me Forgive me

Spade starts to frown then makes his face a blank

IVA
(wails)
I sent those policemen to your place
last night I was mad -- crazy with
jealousy -- and I phoned them that

if theyd go there theyd learn
something about Miles murder

SPADE
What made you think of that

IVA
I was mad Sam I wanted to hurt
you

SPADE

Did you tell them who you were when
you phoned

IVA
No Oh Sam dearest I

SPADE
Where did you phone from

IVA
The drugstore across from your place

SPADE

It was a dumb trick all right but
its done now Youd better run on

police Youll be hearing from
them By the way where were you

IVA
(with no hesitation)

When he came home for dinner that
evening he told me he had a date
with a girl at the St Mark and
that this was my chance to get the

thought he was just making it up to

try and hurt me But well you
knew Miles It would have been like
him to

SPADE

I knew Miles

IVA
I drove down to the St Mark and
just as I got there he came out and
started up the street I followed

INT LIVING ROOM

A flabbily fat man struggles breathlessly to raise up out
of a plush armchair finally succeeds He has bulbous pink
cheeks and lips and chins and neck with a great soft egg
of a belly that is all his torso and pendant cones for
arms and legs

As he advances to meet Spade all his bulbs rise and shake
and fall separately with each step His eyes made small
by fat puffs around them are dark and lustrous Dark
ringlets thinly cover his broad scalp He wears a black
cutaway coat black vest black satin Ascot tie holding a
tear-shaped pearl striped gray worsted trousers and
patent-leather shoes His voice is a throaty purr

GUTMAN
Ah Mr Spade

He extends a hand that is like a fat pink star Spade
takes the hand smiles

SPADE
How do you do Mr Gutman

Holding Spades hand the fat man turns puts his other
hand to Spades elbow guides him across the rug to the
plush armchair beside which is a table that holds a siphon
glasses a bottle of Scotch whiskey and a box of cigars
Spade sits down The fat man begins to fill two glasses
from bottle and siphon The boy opens the door to an
adjacent bedroom withdraws Gutman proffers Spade one

of the glasses

GUTMAN
(purring)
We begin well sir I distrust a
man that says when If hes got

to be careful not to drink too much
its because hes not to be trusted
when he does

Spade takes the glass smiling The fat man raises his
glass holds it against the windows light nods
approvingly

GUTMAN
Well sir heres to plain speaking
and clear understanding
(he regards Spade shrewdly)
Youre a close-mouthed man

SPADE
(shakes his head)
I like to talk

GUTMAN

(exclaims delightedly)
Better and better I distrust a
close-mouthed man He generally
picks the wrong time to talk and
says the wrong things Talkings
something you cant do judiciously
unless you keep in practice

He picks up the box of cigars holds it out to Spade
Spade takes one trims the end of it lights it The fat
man pulls another plush armchair around to face Spades
takes a cigar from the box lowers himself into the chair
His bulbs stop jouncing and settle into flabby rest
Gutman smiles comfortably

GUTMAN
Now sir well talk if you like
and Ill tell you right out that
Im a man who likes talking to a
man that likes to talk

SPADE
Swell Will we talk about the
black bird

Gutmans bulbs ride up and down on his laughter His pink
face is shiny with delight

GUTMAN
Youre the man for me sir No
beating about the bush but right to
the point Let us talk about the
black bird by all means But first
sir answer me a question Are you
here as Miss OShaughnessys
representative

Spade frowns thoughtfully at the ash-tipped end of his
cigar

SPADE
There is nothing certain about it
either way yet It depends

GUTMAN
It depends on --

Spade blows a slanting plume of smoke over the fat mans
head says nothing

GUTMAN
Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo

SPADE
(noncommittally)
Maybe

GUTMAN
(purrs ingratiatingly)
The question is then which youll
represent It will be one or the
other

SPADE
I didnt say so

GUTMAN
(voice sinking to
a throaty whisper)
Who else is there

SPADE
(pointing his cigar
at his chest)
Theres me

The fat man sinks back into his chair blows his breath out
in a long contented gust

GUTMAN
Thats wonderful sir wonderful
I do like a man that tells you right
out hes looking out for himself
Dont we all I dont trust a man
that says hes not

SPADE
(exhales smoke)
Uh-huh Now lets talk about the
black bird

GUTMAN
(benevolently)
Lets

his eyes are but
two dark gleams)

GUTMAN (CONTD)
Mr Spade have you any conception
of how much money can be got for
that black bird

SPADE

GUTMAN
(leans forward
puts his bloated
hands on the arm
of Spades chair)
Well sir if I told you -- if I
told you half -- youd call me a liar

SPADE
(smiles)
No -- not even if I thought so
But you just tell me what it is
and Ill figure out the profits

Gutmans bulbs jostle one another as he laughs again Then
he stops laughing abruptly stares at Spade with an
intentness that suggests myopia

GUTMAN
(sibilantly)
You mean you dont know what the
bird is

Spade makes a careless gesture with his cigar

SPADE
I know what its supposed to look
like I know the value in human
life you people put on it

GUTMAN
(in amazement)
She didnt tell you what it is
And Cairo didnt either

SPADE
He offered me ten thousand for it
GUTMAN
(scornfully)
Ten thousand -- and dollars mind

you not even pounds
(he grunts in disgust)
Humph

GUTMAN (CONTD)

(rests the glass

on his belly

Then half aloud )
They must know what it is -- must
-- but do they

(clears his throat

then in his former

voice)
Do they know what the bird is sir
What is your impression

SPADE
(shakes his head)
Theres not much to go by Cairo
didnt say he did and he didnt
say he didnt She said she
didnt but I took it for granted
she was lying

GUTMAN

That was not an injudicious thing
to do

(he shuts his eyes

opens them suddenly

wide cries )
If they dont know Im the only one
in the whole wide sweet world who
does

SPADE
Swell When youve told me that
will make two of us

Gutman cocks his head at Spade -- eyes a-twinkle
GUTMAN
Mathematically correct sir -- but

I dont know for certain that Im
going to tell you

SPADE
(grins indulgently)
Dont be foolish You know what
it is I know where it is Thats
why Im here

GUTMAN
Well sir where is it

Spade ignores the question The fat man bunches his lips
raises his eyebrows cocks his head even further

GUTMAN
(blandly)
You see I must tell you what I
know but you will not tell me what
you know That is hardly equitable
sir No no I dont think we can
do business along those lines

Spades face becomes hard He gets slowly to his feet

SPADE

(voice low furious)
Think again and think fast I told
that gunman of yours that youd have
to talk to me before you got through
Ill tell you now that youll do your
talking today or you are through
What are you wasting your time for
I can get along without you

He tosses his glass at the table The glass strikes the
wood breaks apart splattering its contents and glittering
fragments over table and floor Spade wheels to confront
Gutman again The fat man pays no more attention to the
glasss fate than does Spade Lips pursed eyebrows
raised head cocked he has maintained his pink-faced
blandness throughout Spades angry speech -- and he
continues to maintain it

SPADE
Another thing I dont want

The door at Spades left opens and the boy comes in shuts
the door stands in front of it hands flat against his

flanks His gaze runs over Spades body from shoulders to
knees then up again to settle on the knot in Spades tie

boy -- repeats)

Another thing Keep that gunsel
away from me while youre making
up your mind I11l kill him

The boys lips twitch in a shadowy smile He neither
raises his eyes nor speaks

GUTMAN
Well sir I must say youve a most
violent temper

Spade crosses to the chair in which he dropped his hat
picks it up and sets it on his head

Bryan across the desk The stenographer also ina

voice resonant
with latent power)
Who killed Thursby

SPADE
I dont know

The DA rubs his black eyeglass ribbon between thumb and
fingers

BRYAN
(knowingly)
Perhaps you dont but you could
make an excellent guess
SPADE
(serenely )
My guess might be excellent or it
might be crummy but Mrs Spade didnt
raise any children dippy enough to
make guesses in front of a district
attorney and a stenographer

BRYAN
Why shouldnt you if youve nothing
to conceal

SPADE
(mildly)
Everybody has something to conceal
BRYAN
And you have --

SPADE
My guesses for one thing

The DA looks down at his desk then up at Spade He
settles his glasses more firmly on his nose

BRYAN
If you prefer not having the
stenographer here we can dismiss
him It was simply a matter of
convenience that I brought him in

SPADE
I dont mind hima bit Im willing

Im willing to sign it

We dont intend asking you to sign
anything I wish you wouldnt
regard this as a formal inquiry at
all And please dont think I have
any belief in those theories the
police seem to have formed

for tobacco and papers)
Im glad of that Whats your theory

Bryan leans forward in his chair his eyes are hard and

Tell me who Archer was shadowing
Thursby for and Ill tell you who
killed Thursby

Spade laughs briefly

BRYAN

Dont misunderstand me Spade

his knuckles)
I dont say your client killed
Thursby or had him killed but I do
say knowing who your client is or
was Ill mighty soon know who
killed Thursby

SPADE
Thats where youre mistaken

BRYAN
Whether or not Im mistaken isnt
for you to judge

SPADE
(interrupting)
I thought this was an informal talk

BRYAN

(sits up straight and

squares shoulders)
I am a sworn officer of the law

formality or informality justifies
your withholding from me evidence of
a crime except of course --

-- on constitutional grounds

Oh Ive got grounds that suit me
better My clients are entitled to
a decent amount of secrecy

as accused me of being mixed up in
the other nights murders Well
Ive had trouble with both of you
before As far as I can see my
best chance of clearing myself of
the trouble you are trying to make
for me is by bringing in the
murderers all tied up and my only
chance of ever catching them and
tying them up and bringing them in
is by keeping away from you and the
police because youd only gum up the
works

(turns his head

over his shoulder

to address the

stenographer )

I going too fast for you

hop to it Youve tried it before

grasps the boy from behind by both arms just beneath the
boys elbows The boy struggles and squirms but he is
impotent in the big mans grip The boy kicks back his
feet but they go between Spades spread legs Spade lifts
the boy up from the floor brings him down hard on his feet

weight forward

This is going to be the most
astounding thing you ever heard of
sir and I say that knowing that a
man of your caliber in your
profession must have known some
astounding things in his time

Spade nods politely The fat man screws up his eyes

GUTMAN
What do you know sir about the
Order of the hospital of St John
of Jerusalem later called the
Knights of Rhodes and other things

SPADE
(lights a cigar)
Crusaders or something werent they

GUTMAN
(approvingly)
Very good In 1539 these Crusading

Knights persuaded the Emperor Charles
V to give them the Island of Malta
(MORE )

GUTMAN (CONTD)
He made but one condition They were
to pay him each year the tribute
of a falcon in acknowledgment that
Malta was still under Spain Do you
follow me

Spade grunts The fat man looks over his shoulder at the
three closed doors then lowers his voice to a husky
whisper

GUTMAN
Have you any conception of the
extreme the immeasurable wealth of
the Order at that time

SPADE
I imagine they were pretty well fixed

GUTMAN

(smiles indulgently)
Pretty well is -- is putting it mildly

(his whisper becomes

lower and more purry)
They were rolling in wealth sir
For years they had taken from the
East nobody knows what spoils of
gems precious metals silks
ivories sir We all know that the
Holy Wars to them were largely a
matter of loot

Spade nods

GUTMAN

-The Knights were profoundly
grateful to the Emperor Charles for
his generosity toward them They
hit upon the happy thought of
sending him for the first years
tribute not an insignificant live
bird but a glorious golden falcon
encrusted from head to feet with the
finest jewels in their coffers

(he leans his

weight back in

his chair takes

a sip out of his

glass then rests

it on his belly)
Well sir what do you think of that
SPADE
(shrugs slightly)
I dont know

GUTMAN
(complacently)
Those are facts historical facts
not school book history not Mr
Wells history but history
nevertheless

Spade nods again drinks

GUTMAN

They sent this foot-high jeweled
bird to Charles who was then in
Spain They sent it in a galley
commanded by a member of the Order

(his voice sinks

to a whisper again)
It never reached Spain A famous
admiral of buccaneers took the
Knights galley and the bird In
1713 it turned up in Sicily In
1840 it appeared in Paris It had
by that time acquired a coat of
black enamel so that it looked like
nothing more than a fairly
interesting black statuette In
that disguise sir it was you
might say kicked around Paris for
more than three score years by
private owners too stupid to see
what it was under the skin Then
in 1923 a Greek dealer named
Charilaos Konstantinides found it in
an obscure shop

(he chuckles)
No thickness of enamel could conceal
value from his eyes

The fat man raises his glass smiles at it emptiness
rises to fill it and Spades

GUTMAN
(working the siphon)
You begin to believe me a little

SPADE
I havent said I didnt

The fat man sits down again drinks generously pats his
mouth with a white handkerchief

GUTMAN

Well sir to hold it safe while
pursuing his researches into its
history Charilaos re-enameled the
bird Despite that precaution
however I got wind of his find

(he sighs deeply)
Ah sir if I had only known a few
days sooner I was in London when I
heard I packed a bag and took the
boat train immediately On the
train I opened a paper the Times
and read that Charilaos
establishment had been burglarized
and him murdered Sure enough upon
arriving there I discovered that
the bird was gone

(he shakes his

head sadly --

then he shuts

his eyes smiles

complacently at

inner thoughts)
That was seventeen years ago Well
sir it took me seventeen years to
locate that bird -- but I did

(he opens his

eyes suddenly)
I wanted it and Im not a man thats
easily discouraged when I want
something

(his smile grows

broad -- he

drains his glass

dries his lips

returns his

handkerchief to

his pocket)
I traced it to the home of a Russian
general -- one Kemidov -- in an
Istanbul suburb He didnt know a
thing about it It was nothing but
a black enameled figure to him but
his natural contrariness kept him
from selling it to me when I made
him an offer So I sent some -- ah
-- agents to get it Well sir
they got it and I havent got it

(he stands up again

carries his empty

glass to the table)
But Im going to get it Your
glass sir

They both

SPADE
Then the bird doesnt belong to any
of you but to a General Kemidov

GUTMAN

(filling Spades glass)
Well sir you might say it belonged
to the King of Spain but I dont see
how you can honestly grant anybody
else clear title to it -- except by
right of possession

(he leans forward

puts his hand on

Spades knee)
Well now before we start to talk

prices how soon can you -- or how
soon are you willing to produce the
Falcon

SPADE

A couple of days

GUTMAN
(nods )
That is satisfactory
(he holds up his glass)
Well sir heres to a fair bargain
and profits large enough for both
of us

drink

SPADE
Whats your idea of a fair bargain

GUTMAN
Ill give you twenty-five thousand
dollars when you deliver the Falcon
to me and another twenty-five
thousand later on Or Ill give
you one quarter of what I realize on
the Falcon That would amount to a
vastly greater sum

SPADE
How much greater

GUTMAN
Who knows Shall I say one hundred
thousand Will you believe me if
I name the sum that seems the
probable minimum

SPADE
Why not

GUTMAN
(lowers his voice
to a purring murmur)
What would you say to quarter of a
million

SPADE
(narrowing his eyes)
Then you think the dingus is worth
a million

GUTMAN
(serenely )
In your own words why not

Spade empties his glass sets it on the table puts his
cigar in his mouth takes it out looks at it distastefully
lays it on the ash tray

SPADE
Thats a lot of dough

GUTMAN
A lot of dough

SPADE
The minimum huh And the maximum
There is an unmistakable sh following the x in maximum
as Spade says it The fat man leans forward pats Spades
knee

GUTMAN
The maximum I refuse to guess
Youd think me crazy I dont know
Theres no telling how high it could
go sir and thats the one and only
truth about it

Spade pulls his lower lip tight against the upper shakes
his head raises his right hand presses his palm against
the base of his head Then he stands up helping himself
with his hands on the arms of his chair

He shakes his head again takes an uncertain step forward
Gutman jumps up pushes back his chair His fat globes
jiggle His eyes are dark holes in an oily face Spade
swings his head from side to side until his dull eyes are
pointed to the door He takes another uncertain step

GUTMAN
(calls sharply)
Wilmer

The door to the bedroom opens and the boy comes in
Through the door we see a row of cases and bags closed and
ready for traveling on the floor Spade takes a third
step His jaw muscles stand out like tumors under his
ears His legs do not straighten again after his fourth
step and his dull eyes are all but covered by their lids
He takes a fifth step

The boy comes over stands close to Spade hands inside his
coat over his heart The corners of his mouth twitch
Spade essays a sixth step The boys leg darts out in
front of Spades leg Spade trips and crashes face
downward on the floor The boy keeping his right hand
under his coat looks down at Spade Spade tries to get
up The boy draws his right foot far back kicks Spades
temple

The kick rolls Spade over on his side Once more he tries
to get up -- cannot -- goes to sleep Joel Cairo appears

Staggering slightly the form moves away from CAMERA toward

It reaches the window opens it drinks in air with gasps
that are like sobs Then it leaves the window
disappearing into darkness

The lights come on and we see Spade standing one hand on

join His right temple is dark and swollen He turns away
from the switch to look with dazed heavy- lidded eyes

Jacoby didnt he Anyway hes
made to order for the part Lets
turn him over to them

The boy tightens the corners of his mouth Spades
proposal seems to have no other effect on him Joel

Cairos dark face is open-eyed amazed

Brigid moves away

from Spade twists herself around on the sofa to stare at
him Gutman remains still expressionless for a long
moment Then he decides to laugh He laughs heartily

and at length

GUTMAN

By Gad sir youre a character --

that you are
(takes a white
handkerchief from
his pocket and
wipes his eyes)

Theres never any telling what youll
say or do next except that it is bound

to be something astonishing

SPADE
(in the manner of
one reasoning with
a recalcitrant friend)

Its our best bet With him in their

hands the police will --

GUTMAN

But my dear man cant you see if I
even for the moment thought of doing

such a thing -- but thats

ridiculous I feel toward Wilmer
just exactly as if he were my own
son Really I do But if I even
for a moment thought of doing as you
propose what in the world do you
think would keep Wilmer from telling
the police every last detail about

the Falcon and all of us

SPADE

Let him talk his head off I promise
you nobody will do anything about it

GUTMAN
(laughs uproariously
turns to look at the
boy)

What do you think of this Wilmer

Its mighty funny eh

The boys eyes are cold pale gleams under his lashes

WILMER
(voice low distinct)
Mighty funny

SPADE
(to Brigid)
How do you feel now Angel any
better

BRIGID
Yes much better only
(she lowers her voice
to a whisper)
Im frightened

SPADE
(puts a hand on her knee)
Dont be Nothing very bads going
to happen Want a drink

BRIGID
(shakes her head)
Be careful Sam

Spade grins looks at Gutman

GUTMAN

(clears his throat

laughs then )
Well sir if youre really serious
about this the least we can do in
common politeness is to hear you
out Now how would you be able
to fix it

(laughs again)
--SO that Wilmer couldnt do us
any harm

SPADE
Bryans like most district attorneys
To be sure of convicting one man
hell let half a dozen equally guilty
accomplices go free I can show him
that if he starts fooling around
trying to gather up everybody --
hes going to have a tangled case
while if he sticks to Wilmer here
he can get a conviction standing on
his head

Walking stiff-legged the boy advances from the doorway
until he is in the center of the floor He halts there
leans forward slightly from the waist hand and pistol
still dangle at his side but his knuckles are white over
the pistols grip The indelible youngness of his face
gives an indescribably vicious and inhuman turn to the
white hot hatred and the cold white malevolence in his
face

WILMER
(to space in a voice
cramped by passion)
Get up on your feet

Spade smiles at the boy His amusement seems genuine and
unalloyed

WILMER
Ive taken all the riding from you
Im going to take Get up and

shoot it out

SPADE
Young wild West
(glances at Gutman)
Maybe you ought to tell him that
shooting me before you get your
hands on the Falcon will be bad
for business

Gutmans voice is too hoarse and gritty for the paternally
admonishing tone he tries to achieve

GUTMAN
Now now Wilmer We cant have any
of that You shouldnt let yourself
attach such importance to these things

WILMER
(eyes on Spades
face as before)
Make him lay off then

GUTMAN
Now Wilmer
(to Spade)
Your plan is sir not at all
practical sir Lets not say
anything more about it

SPADE
All right -- Ive got another
suggestion Its not as good as the
first but its better than nothing
Want to hear it

GUTMAN
Most assuredly

SPADE
Give them Cairo

Gutman tries to laugh cannot then

GUTMAN
(in an uncertain tone)
Well by Gad sir

CAIRO
(voice shrill with
indignation)
Suppose we give them you Mr Spade
Or Miss OShaughnessy How about
that

SPADE

You people want the Falcon Ive
got it A fall-guy is part of the
price Im asking

(his dispassionate gaze

moves to the girl)
If you think she can be rigged for
the part Im perfectly willing to
discuss it with you

The girl puts her hands to her throat utters a short
strangled cry

CAIRO
(his face and body
twitching with
excitement )
You seem to forget you are not ina
position to insist on anything

Spade laughs -- a harsh derisive laugh

GUTMAN
Come now gentlemen lets keep our
discussion on a friendly basis But
there certainly is
(cocks his head at Spade)
--something in what Mr Cairo says

SPADE
If you kill me how are you going to
get the bird If I know you cant
afford to kill me how are you going
to scare me into giving it to you

Gutmans eyes twinkle between puckered lips

GUTMAN
Well sir there are other means of
persuasion besides killing and
threatening to kill

SPADE
Sure But they arent much good
unless the threat of death is behind
them See what I mean If you start
anything Ill make it a matter of your
having to kill me or call it off

GUTMAN

(chuckles )
Thats an attitude sir that calls
for the most delicate judgment on
both sides -- because as you know
sir in the heat of action men are
likely to forget where their best
interests lie and let their emotions
carry them away

SPADE
(all smiling blandness)
The trick from my angle would be to
make my play strong enough to tie you
up yet not make you made enough to

bump me off -- against your better
judgment
GUTMAN
(fondly)

By Gad sir you are a character

Joel Cairo gets up from his chair walks around behind the
boy to Gutmans chair bends over screens his mouth and
whispers into the fat mans ear Gutman listens
attentively nodding from time to time Spade grins at
Brigid OShaughnessy then turns to the boy

SPADE
Two to one theyre selling you
out son

The boy says nothing A muscular spasm seizes the hand
that is holding the gun Hand and gun jerk convulsively

SPADE
(to Gutman)
I hope youre not letting yourself
be influenced by the guns these
pocket edition desperadoes are
waving

Cairo stops whispering makes himself erect behind the fat
mans chair

SPADE
Ive practiced taking them away from
both of them so therell be no
trouble there Wilmer here is

WILMER
(furious choked
by emotion)
All right

He jerks his pistol up in front of his chest Gutman
flings a fat hand out to the boys wrist Joel Cairo
scurries around to the boys other side grasps his other
arm holding onto the boys wrist Gutman struggles to get
his fat body out of the rocking chair succeeds Then he
and Cairo wrestle with the boy forcing his arms down

Words come out of the struggling group Fragments of the
boys incoherent speech Fog Go Riding

Smoke Gutman repeats Now now Wilmer many times and
Cairo No please dont and You mustnt Wilmer
Wooden-faced dreamy-eyed Spade gets up from the sofa goes
over to the group The boy unable to cope with the weight
against him has stopped struggling

Spade drives his left fist against the boys chin The
boys head snaps back When it comes forward Spade drives
his right fist against the boys chin Cairo drops the
boys arm letting him collapse against Gutmans round
belly Cairo springs at Spade clawing at his face Tears
are in the Greeks eyes and his lips work angrily but no
sound comes from between them

SPADE
(laughing)
Cairo youre a pip

He cuffs the side of Cairos face with an open hand
knocking him over against the table Cairo regains his
balance springs again Spade stops him with a long rigid
arm the palm flat against Cairos face Cairo failing to
reach Spade flails his shorter arms at empty air

SPADE
(growls)
Stop it I11 hurt you

Cairo backs away Spade stops to pick up Cairos pistol
from the floor and then the boys He straightens up
holding them in his left hand dangling them upside-down
by their trigger guards from his fore-finger Gutman who
has put the boy in the rocking chair stands looking down
at him with troubled eyes Cairo goes down on his knees
beside the chair begins to chafe the boys limp hands
Spade crosses to the chair feels around the boys jaw with
his fingers

SPADE
Nothing cracked Well spread him
out on the sofa

He lifts the boy without apparent effort carries him to
the sofa Brigid OShaughnessy gets up quickly Spade
places the boy on the sofa With his right hand he pats
the boys clothes finds his second pistol adds it to the
others in his left hand then turns his back on the sofa
Cairo comes over and sits down beside the boys head
Spade clinks the pistols together in his hands smiles
cheerfully at Gutman

SPADE
Theres our fall guy

Gutmans eyes are clouded troubled He does not look at
Spade but at the floor

SPADE
Either youll say yes right now or
Ill turn the Falcon and the whole
lot of you in

Gutmans eyes dart from the floor to Spades face
GUTMAN

(sharply)
I dont like that sir

Spade rattles the guns together impatiently

SPADE
You wont like it Well

The fat man sighs makes a wry face

GUTMAN
(sadly)
You can have him

SPADE
Thats swell

Cairo sitting on the sofa rubs the boys temple and
wrists smoothes his hair back from his forehead peers
anxiously at his white still face Except for his
breathing the boys small figure is altogether corpse-
like Spade puts his handful of pistols on the table
takes a chair at a corner of the table glances at the
tinny alarm clock atop the Celebrated Criminal Cases

SPADE
Two oclock I cant get the Falcon
till daylight or maybe later

GUTMAN
It strikes me that it would be best
for all concerned if we did not get
out of each others sight until our
business has been transacted
(he looks at the sofa)
--You have the envelope

Spade shakes his head glances over at the sofa then
looks around at the girl

SPADE
Miss OShaughnessy has it

BRIGID
Yes I have it
(puts a hand inside
her jacket)
I picked it up

SPADE

Thats all right -- hang onto it
(to Gutman)

We wont have to lose sight of each
other The dingus will be brought
to us here

GUTMAN
Excellent sir Excellent Then

in exchange for the ten thousand
dollars and Wilmer you will give
us the Falcon and an hour or two
of grace

Spade takes out tobacco and paper starts rolling a
cigarette

SPADE
Lets get the details fixed Why
did he shoot Thursby and why and
where and how did he shoot Captain
Jacoby Ive got to know all that
happened so I can be sure the parts
that wont fit are covered up

Gutman interlaces his fingers over his belly rocks in his
chair

GUTMAN

(forthrightly)
I shall be candid with you sir
Thursby was Miss OShaughnessys
ally We believed that disposing
of him in the manner we did would
cause Miss OShaughnessy to stop
and think that perhaps it would
be best to patch up her differences
with us regarding the Falcon

SPADE
You didnt try to make a deal with
him before giving him the works

GUTMAN

(emphatically)
We did -- yes sir We most certainly
did I talked to him myself that
very night but I could do nothing
with him He was quite determinedly
loyal to Miss OShaughnessy So
Wilmer followed him back to his hotel
and did what he did

SPADE
(after a moments thought)
That sounds all right Now Jacoby
GUTMAN
(gravely)

Captain Jacobys death was entirely
Miss OShaughnessys fault

Brigid gasps puts her hand to her mouth

SPADE
Tell me what happened

GUTMAN

(rocking throughout)
Well Cairo as you must have
surmised got in touch with me after
he left police headquarters yesterday
night -- or morning He recognized
the mutual advantage of pooling forces

(directs his smile

at Cairo)
Mr Cairo is a man of nice judgment
The Paloma was his thought He saw
the notice of its arrival in the
papers and remembered that he had
heard in Hong Kong that Jacoby and
Miss OShaughnessy had been seen
together Well sir he saw that
notice and putting two and two
together guessed the truth -- she
had given the bird to Jacoby to
bring here for her

SPADE
And at that juncture you decided to
slip me the mickey huh

GUTMAN

(nods then apologetically)
There was no place for you in our
plans sir so we decided to spare
ourselves any possible embarrassment
Mr Cairo and Wilmer and I went to
call on Captain Jacoby We were
lucky enough to arrive while Miss
OShaughnessy was there In many
ways it was a difficult conference
but we finally persuaded Miss
OShaughnessy to come to terms or
so we thought We then left the
boat and set out for my hotel where
I was to pay Miss OShaughnessy and
receive the bird Well sir we
mere men should have known better
En route she and Captain Jacoby and
the Falcon slipped completely
through our fingers

(he laughs merrily --

then turns to beam

at Brigid)
It was neatly done sir Indeed it was

Spade looks at the girl Her eyes large and dark with

pleading meet his

SPADE
(to Gutman)
You touched off the boat before you
left

GUTMAN
Not intentionally though I dare say
we or Wilmer at least were
responsible for one fire While the
rest of us were talking in the
cabin Wilmer went about the ship
trying to find the Falcon No doubt
he was careless with matches

SPADE
All right Now about the shooting
GUTMAN
We caught up with Miss OShaughnessy
and Jacoby at her apartment I sent

Wilmer downstairs to cover the fire
escape before ringing the bell And
sure enough while she was asking us
who we were through the door and we
told her we heard a window go up
Wilmer shot Jacoby as he was coming
down the fire escape -- shot him
more than once But Jacoby was too
tough either to fall or drop the
Falcon He climbed the rest of the
way down knocked Wilmer over and
ran off

(he breaks off to

smile at a memory)
We persuaded -- that is the word
sir we ah persuaded Miss
OShaughnessy to tell us where she
had told Captain Jacoby to take the
Falcon And we ah further
ah persuaded her to phone your
office in an attempt to draw you
away before Jacoby got there But
unfortunately for us it had taken
too long to persuade Miss
OShaughnessy

The boy on the sofa groans rolls over
eyes open and close several times

on his side

His

GUTMAN
(concludes hurriedly)
And you had the Falcon before we
could reach you

The boy puts one foot on the floor raises himself on an
elbow opens eyes wide puts the other foot down sits up
and looks around When his eyes focus on Spade bewilder-
ment leaves them Spade gets up from his chair to sit on
the corner of the table The boy looks at Gutman Gutman
smiles benignly

GUTMAN

Well Wilmer I am sorry indeed to
lose you and I want you to know that
I couldnt be any fonder of you if
you were my own son But well by
Gad if you lose a son its possible
to get another and theres only one
Maltese Falcon

Spade laughs The boys eyes remain on Gutmans face

GUTMAN
(sighs -- then to Spade)
When youre young you simply dont
understand these things

Spade grins at Gutman

SPADE
(to Brigid)
How about some coffee Put the pot
on will you I dont like to leave
my guests

BRIGID
(quickly)
Surely

She starts toward the door

GUTMAN
(stops rocking)
Just a moment my dear
(holds up a
thick hand)
Hadnt you better leave the envelope
in here

Brigids eyes question Spade Spade nods She puts her
hand inside her coat takes out the envelope gives it to
Spade He tosses it into Gutmans lap
SPADE
Sit on it if you are afraid of
losing it

GUTMAN

(suavely)
You misunderstand me It is not
that at all but business should be
trans acted in a business-like
manner

(he opens the

envelope takes

out and counts

the bills then

chuckles)
For instance there are only nine
bills here now

(he spreads them

on his knee)
There were ten when I handed it to
you as you very well know

(his smile is broad

jovial and triumphant)

SPADE

(looks at Brigid)

Well

She shakes her head Her lips move slightly

frightened
money is put into it

-- and returns it to Gutman Spade picks up
pistols from the table rises

SPADE
(matter-of-factly)
I want to know about this

Cairo looks at Spade with questioning eyes
him does not look up He is leaning forward

hands elbow between knees

his feet

SPADE
(to Gutman)
You palmed it

GUTMAN
(chuckles )
I palmed it

Her face is

Spade holds out his hand to Gutman and the
Spade counts the money -- nine bills

the three

The boy beside
head between

staring at the floor between

SPADE
Yes
(he jingles his
pistols in his pocket)
Do you want to say so or do you want
to stand for a frisk

GUTMAN
Stand for

SPADE
Youre going to admit it or Im
going to search you Theres no
third way

Gutman rocks back in his chair laughs delightedly

GUTMAN
By Gad sir I believe you would I
really do You are a character sir
-- if you dont mind my saying so

SPADE
You palmed it

GUTMAN
Yes sir that I did

He takes a crumpled bill from his vest pocket smoothes
it on his thigh then opening the flap of the envelope
puts the smoothed bill in with the others

GUTMAN

I must have my little joke now and
then And I was curious to know what
youd do in a situation of that sort
I must say that you passed the test
with flying colors sir It never
occurred to me that youd hit on
such a simple and direct way of
getting at the truth

(he beams at Spade)

SPADE
(sneering)
Thats the kind of thing Id expect
from somebody Wilmers age

Gutman chuckles Brigid exits into the kitchen Gutman
offers Spade the white envelope Spade looks at the
pistols in his hand then at Gutman goes into the passage
to the closet opens the closet door puts the pistols on
top of a trunk shuts the door locks it turns back into
the living room

GUTMAN
This will soon be yours You might
as well take it

Spade does not take it He sits on the arm of the armchair

SPADE
I ought to have more than ten
thousand

GUTMAN

Of course sir you understand that
this is the first payment Later

SPADE
(laughing)
I know youll give me millions later
But hows about fifteen thousand now

GUTMAN
Frankly and candidly and on my word
of honor as a gentleman ten thousand
is all the money I can raise

SPADE
But you didnt say positively

GUTMAN
(laughs -- repeats)
Positively

Spade puts out his hand The fat man lays the envelope in
it then screws up his eyes moves his head to indicate the
kitchen

GUTMAN
Id like to give you a word of
advice

SPADE
Go ahead

GUTMAN

I dare say youll give her some money
but if you dont give her as much as
she thinks she ought to have my word
of advice is -- be careful

SPADE
(mockingly)
Dangerous

GUTMAN
(nods slowly)
Very

Spade calls toward the kitchen

SPADE
Hows the coffee coming

BRIGIDS VOICE
(over scene)
Its coming

Gutman glances at his watch

GUTMAN
It is six oclock Mr Spade Can
you start getting it now

SPADE
I guess so

He gets up stretches goes to the telephone dials a
number Gutman stops rocking and Cairo takes the
handkerchief away from his mouth while Spade is waiting for
the number to answer The boy lies down with his feet
toward Cairo turns his face to the window Brigid comes
to the door carrying a tray with coffee pot cups sugar
and cream Seeing Spade at the telephone she stops in the
threshold stands waiting Spade whistles two lines of En
Cuba softly

SPADE
(into phone)

DISSOLVE TO
INT LIVING ROOM - SPADES APARTMENT

A strip of daylight shows between the drawn curtains at one
of the windows The electric lights are still on The

clock on the side table says ten minutes of eight The air
in the room is thick with tobacco smoke Gutman is in his
rocker smoking a cigar and reading from Celebrated Cases

The boy is fast asleep on the sofa Cairo at the farthest
corner of the sofa is nodding The girl is curled up in
the arm chair her cheek resting against the back of the
chair Shes not asleep

Spade sits at a corner of the table smoking and drinking
coffee Coffee pot and dirty cups and saucers stand on the
table He mashes the last of his cigarette in his saucer
stretches gets up goes to the window opens the curtains
Sunlight shows on the panes He leaves the window goes to
the wall switch turns off the electricity Gutmans eyes
raise from his book now and then as Spade moves around the
room Brigids eyes never leave Spade

OVER SCENE the street door bell rings Cairo jerks to
wakefulness Gutman puts down his book Spade goes to the
telephone box and presses the button releasing the street
door lock Brigid puts her legs down from the chair sits

up

GUTMAN
(to Spade)
You dont mind if I go to the door
with you

Spade nods -- Gutman struggles out of his chair -- follows
Spade into corridor CAMERA TROLLIES after them

THE CORRIDOR DOOR

Spade opens it OVER SCENE the SOUND of the elevator
Presently the elevator door opens and Effie Perine comes
out carrying the brown-wrapped parcel Her boyish face is
gay and bright She comes forward quickly After one
quick glance she does not look at Gutman Smiling she
gives Spade the parcel

SPADE
Thanks a lot lady Im sorry to
spoil your day of rest but this

EFFIE
(laughing)
It is not the first one youve
spoiled Anything else
SPADE
(shaking his head)
No thanks
EFFIE

Bye-bye then

She turns and goes back to the elevator Spade shuts the
door CAMERA TROLLIES AHEAD of Spade and Gutman as they
carry the parcel into the living room

INT LIVING ROOM

Gutmans face is dark his cheeks quivery Cairo and
Brigid come to the table as Spade puts the parcel there
The boy rises pale and tense but he remains by the sofa
staring under curling lashes at the others

SPADE
(stepping back from
the table)
There you are

Gutmans fat fingers make short work of cord and paper and
excelsior

GUTMAN
(huskily)
Now -- after seventeen years

He takes the black bird holds it in both hands looks at
it with eyes that are moist

GUTMAN
(softly)
Ah

Cairo licks his lips works his hands together The girls
lower lip is between her teeth Everyone including Spade
is breathing heavily Gutman puts the bird down on the
table fumbles in a pocket

GUTMAN
It is it But we will make sure

Sweat glistens on his round cheeks His fingers twitch as
he takes out a gold pocket-knife opens it Cairo and the
girl stand close to him one on either side Spade stands
back a little where he can watch the boy as well as the
group at the table Gutman turns the bird upside-down
scratches an edge of its base with the knife Black enamel
comes off in tiny curls exposing gray metal beneath

CAMERA MOVES TO
CLOSEUP - THE BIRD
as Gutmans blade bites into the metal turning back a thin

curving shaving Gutmans hands twist the bird around and
the knife hacks at its head

120 CLOSE SHOT - GROUP

Gutmans breath hisses between his teeth His face becomes
turgid with hot blood He hacks wildly at the bird its
head throat breast Then suddenly he lets knife and bird
bang down on the table wheels to confront Spade

GUTMAN
(hoarsely )
Its a fake

Spades face is somber His nod is slow His eyes detach
themselves from the scarred black bird travel to Brigids

SPADE
(growls into her face)
All right Youve had your little
joke Now tell us about it

BRIGID
(cries)
No Sam no Thats the one I
got from Kemidov I swear

Joel Cairo thrusts himself between Spade and Gutman emits
words in a shrill spluttering strain

CAIRO

(screaming -- to Gutman)
You bungled it You and your stupid
attempt to buy it Kemidov caught
on to how valuable it was

(tears run down

his face and

he dances up

and down)
No wonder we had so little trouble
stealing it You imbecile You
bloated idiot

(he puts his hands

to his face and

blubbers )
Gutmans jaw sags He blinks with vacant eyes then he
collects himself -- again becomes the jovial smiling fat
man
GUTMAN
(good-naturedly )
Yes That is the Russians hand
Theres no doubt of it
(to Cairo)

Well sir what do you suggest
(MORE )

GUTMAN (CONTD)
Shall we stand here and shed tears
and call each other names or shall
we
(smiling like a cherub)
»-go to Istanbul

The Greek takes his hands from his face His eyes bulge

CAIRO
(stammers )
You are
(amazement makes
him speechless)

The fat man pats his fat hands together and his eyes
twinkle

GUTMAN

(voice a throaty purr)
For seventeen years I have wanted
that little item and have been
trying to get it If I must spend
another year on the quest -- well
sir -- that will be an additional
expenditure in time of only

(his lips move

silently as he

calculates)
five and fifteen-seventeenths
percent

Cairo giggles then cries

CAIRO
I go with you

Spade starts slightly looks from right to left The

others observing Spades movements also look around

boy is gone

GUTMAN
Wilmer What

Spade goes to the corridor

LONG SHOT - CORRIDOR

The

standing open SHOOTING over Spades shoulder as he looks
down the empty corridor He closes the door and returns to

the others in the living room
144

SPADE
(sourly)
A swell lot of thieves

GUTMAN

We have little enough to boast
about sir but the world hasnt
come to an end just because weve
run into a little set-back

(he extends his

hand palm up)
Ill have to ask for that envelope

sir
SPADE
(wooden-faced)
I held up my end -- you got your
dingus Its your hard luck not

mine it wasnt what you wanted

GUTMAN
(persuasively)
Now come sir weve all failed and
theres no reason for expecting any
of us to bear the whole brunt

He brings his right hand from behind him In it is a small
pistol ornately engraved and inlaid with silver and gold
and mother-of-pearl

GUTMAN
In short sir I must ask you to
return my ten thousand

Spades face does not change He shrugs takes the
envelope from his pocket He starts to hold it out to
Gutman hesitates opens the envelope takes out one of the
bills He puts it into his trouser pocket Then he tucks
the envelopes flap in over the other bills and holds the
envelope out to Gutman

SPADE
That will take care of my time and
expenses

Gutman after a little pause imitates Spades shrug and
accepts the envelope

GUTMAN
Now sir we will say goodbye to
you unless you care to undertake
the Istanbul expedition with us
You dont

(MORE )

GUTMAN (CONTD)
Well sir frankly Id like to have
you along Youre a man of nice judgment
and many resources Now that there is
no alternative I am sure that youll
somehow manage the police without
a fall-guy

SPADE
Ill make out all right

GUTMAN

Well sir the shortest farewells
are the best Adieu

(he makes a portly bow)
And to you Miss OShaughnessy
I leave the Rara Avis there on
the table

(he waves toward

the bird)
--aS a little momento

Gutman and Cairo withdraw Cairo preceding him down the
short hall and through the corridor door Spade does not
look at Brigid but stands motionless his eyes gloomy under
a forehead drawn down until the SOUND of the elevator comes
OVER SCENE Then he goes to the telephone

CLOSE SHOT - SPADE AT TELEPHONE

takes the receiver off the hook and dials a number Brigid
watches him a slight frown on her face

SPADE
(into phone)
Hello Is Sergeant Polhaus there
--Please This is Samuel Spade

(he stares into space

waiting then )
Hello Tom Ive got something
for you Here it is Thursby
and Jacoby were shot by a kid named
Wilmer Cook about twenty years old
five feet six inches tall In gray
woolen suit gray single-breasted
overcoat and hat shirt with soft
attached collar and a light crepe
silk tie Hes working for a man
named Casper Gutman You cant miss
Gutman He must weigh three hundred
pounds That fellow Cairo is in
with them too Right

(MORE )

SPADE (CONTD)
They just left here for the Alexandria
Hotel but theyre blowing town so
youll have to move fast I dont
think theyre expecting a pinch
Watch yourself when you go up
against the kid Thats right
Tom and good luck

Spade slowly replaces the receiver on the prong He fills
his chest with air and exhales His eyes are glittering
between narrowed lids He turns takes three swift steps
toward Brigid OShaughnessy The girl startled by the
suddenness of his approach lets her breath out in a little
gasp Spade face to face with Brigid looks at her hard
of jaw and eye

SPADE
Theyll talk when theyre nailed --
about us Were sitting on dynamite
Weve only got minutes to get set for
the police Give me all of it fast

She starts to speak hesitates bites her lip Spade takes
her by the shoulder cries angrily

SPADE
Talk
BRIGID
(uncertainly)
Where shall I begin
SPADE

The day you first came to my office
Why did you want Thursby shadowed

BRIGID
I told you Sam I suspected him
of betraying me and I wanted to
find out

SPADE
Thats a lie You had Thursby
hooked and you knew it You wanted
to get him out of the way before
Jacoby came with the loot Isnt
that so

Brigid lowers her eyes shame-facedly

SPADE
What was your scheme
BRIGID
(timidly)
I thought that if he saw someone
following him he might be
frightened into going away

SPADE
Miles hadnt many brains but he
wasnt clumsy enough to be spotted

the first night You must have told

Thursby he was being followed

BRIGID

I told him

(catches her breath

tortures her lower lip)
I told him Yes But please
believe me Sam I wouldnt have
told him if I had thought Floyd
would kill him I wouldnt for
a minute --

SPADE
If you thought he wouldnt kill
Miles you were right Angel

BRIGID
(her upraised face
holds utter astonishment)
Didnt he

SPADE

Miles hadnt many brains but he
had too many years of experience
as a detective to be caught like
that -- by a man he was shadowing
-- up a blind alley with his gun
tucked away in his hip and his
overcoat buttoned

(he takes his hand

away from her

shoulder looks

at her for a long

moment then )
But he would have gone up there
with you Angel He was just
dumb enough for that Hed have
looked you up and down and licked
his lips and gone grinning from
ear to ear And then you could
have stood as close to him as you
liked in the dark and put a hole
through him with the gun you had
gotten from Thursby that evening

Brigid shrinks back from him until the edge of the table
stops her

BRIGID
(staring with
terrified eyes)

Dont -- dont talk to me like that

Sam You know I didnt You know --
SPADE

Stop it

(he glances at the clock)
The police will be blowing in any
minute now Talk

BRIGID
(puts the back of
her hand to her
forehead)
Oh why do you accuse me of such a
terrible

SPADE
(very low -- impatient)
This isnt the spot for the
school-girl act The pair of us
are sitting under the gallows

He grasps her wrists forcing her to stand up straight in
front of him Her face becomes suddenly haggard

SPADE
Why did you shoot him

BRIGID

(voice hushed and

troubled)
I didnt mean to at first I
didnt really but when I saw that
Floyd couldnt be frightened I
-- I cant look at you and tell
you this Sam

(she starts to sob

clings to him)

SPADE
You thought Thursby would tackle him
and one or the other of them would
go down If Thursby was the one
then you were rid of him If it was
Miles then you could see that
Thursby was caught and youd be rid
of him That it

BRIGID
S -- something -- like -- that

SPADE
And when you found that Thursby
didnt mean to tackle him you
borrowed the gun and did it
yourself Right

She nods mutely

SPADE
You didnt know then that Gutman was
here hunting for you You didnt

suspect that or you wouldnt have
been trying to shake your protector
But you knew Gutman was here when
you heard Thursby had been shot and
you knew you needed another
protector -- so you came back to me

She puts her hands up around the back of his neck pushing
his head down until his mouth all but touches hers

BRIGID
Yes but -- Oh sweetheart it
wasnt only that I would have
come back to you sooner or later
From the very first instant I saw
you I knew

He puts his arms around her holding her tight to him

SPADE
(tenderly )
You Angel Well if you geta
good break youll be out of San
Quentin in twenty years and you
can come back to me then

She draws away from him slightly throws her head far back
to stare up at him uncomprehending

SPADE
(tenderly )
I hope they dont hang you Precious
by that sweet neck

He puts his hand up and caresses her throat In an instant
she is out of his arms back against the table crouching
both hands spread over her throat Her face is wild-eyed
haggard Her mouth opens and closes

BRIGID
(in a small
parched voice)
Youre not
(she can get no
other words out)

Spades face is damp with sweat now His mouth smiles
and there are smile wrinkles around his glittering eyes

SPADE

(gently)
Im going to send you over The
chances are youll get off with
life That means youll be out
again in twenty years Youre
an angel I11l wait for you

(he clears his

throat)
If they hang you Ill always
remember you

Brigid drops her hands stands erect Her face becomes
smooth and untroubled except for the faint est of dubious

glints in her eyes She smiles back at him
BRIGID
Dont Sam Dont say that -- even
in fun Oh you frightened me for
a moment I really thought -- you
do such wild and unpredictable
things

She breaks off thrusts her head forward and stares deep
into his eyes The flesh around her mouth shivers and fear
comes back into her eyes She puts her hands to her throat
again Spade laughs His laugh is a croak

SPADE
Dont be silly Youre taking
the fall

BRIGID
But -- but Sam you cant Not
after what weve been to each
other You cant
(she takes a long
trembling breath)

Youve been playing with me -- only
pretending you cared -- to trap me
like this You didnt -- care at

all You -- dont -- 1 -- love me

The muscles holding his smile stand out like walls

SPADE
I think I do What of it I
wont play the sap for you

BRIGID
(tears come to her eyes)
You know it is not like that You
cant say that

SPADE
I am saying it Youve never played
square with me for half an hour at
a stretch since Ive known you

Brigid blinks her tears away takes a few steps backward
stands looking at him straight and proud

BRIGID
You know down deep in your heart
you know that in spite of anything
Ive done I love you
He puts his hand back on her shoulder the hand shakes and
jerks

SPADE
I dont care who loves who Im
not going to play the sap for you
I wont walk in Thursbys -- and
I dont know how many others --
footsteps You killed Miles and
youre going over for it

She takes his hand from her shoulder holds it close to her
face

BRIGID
Why must you do this to me Sam
Surely Mr Archer wasnt as much
to you as --

He is no longer smiling He pulls his hand away from her
His wet face is set hard and deeply lined His eyes burn
madly

SPADE
Listen This wont do any good
Youll never understand me but I1l
try once and then give it up
Listen When a mans partner is
killed hes supposed to do
something about it

(MORE )

SPADE (CONTD)

It doesnt make any difference what

you thought of him He was your partner
and youre supposed to do something
about it Then it happens were in

the detective business Well when

one of your organization gets killed
its bad business to let the killer

get away with it -- bad all around
-- bad for every detective
everywhere

BRIGID

You dont expect me to think that
these things youre saying are
sufficient reason for sending me to
the

SPADE
Wait till Im through Then you can
talk Third Ive no earthly
reason to think I can trust you and
if I did this and got away with it
youd have something on me you could
use whenever you wanted to Next
since Ive got something on you I
couldnt be sure you wouldnt decide
to put a hole in me some day
Fifth I wouldnt even like the
idea of thinking that there might be
one chance in a hundred that youd
played me for a sucker And sixth
But thats enough All those are on
one side Maybe some of them are
unimportant I wont argue about
that But look at the number of
them Now on the other side weve
got what All weve got is that
maybe you love me and maybe I love
you

BRIGID
(whispers )
You know whether you love me or not

SPADE
Maybe I do

He looks hungrily from her hair to her feet and up to her
eyes again

SPADE

What of it Maybe next month I wont
Ive been through it before Ill
have some rotten nights after Ive
sent you over but thatll pass

(he takes her

by the shoulders

bends her back

leaning over her)
If all Ive said doesnt mean
anything to you forget it and well

make it just this I wont because
all of me wants to -- regardless of
consequences -- and because youve

counted on that with me the same as
you counted on that with the
others

(he takes his

hands from

her shoulders

lets them fall

to his side)

She puts her hands up to his cheeks draws his face down
toward her again

BRIGID
Look at me and tell me the truth
Would you have done this to me if
the Falcon had been real and you
had been paid your money

SPADE
Dont be too sure Im as crooked
as Im supposed to be That kind
of reputation might be good business
bringing in high-priced jobs and
making it easier to deal with the
enemy

She looks at him says nothing Spade moves his shoulders
a little

SPADE
But a lot of money would have been
at least one more item on your side
of the scales

BRIGID
(whispers )
If you loved me youd need nothing
more on that side

SPADE
(his voice a
hoarse creak)
I wont play the sap for you

She puts her mouth to his slowly and is in his arms when
the doorbell RINGS Before he releases her he calls

SPADE
Come in

MED SHOT - ROOM - ANGLE ON DOOR

Lieutenant Dundy Tom Polhaus and two other detectives
enter They look back and forth from Spade to the girl

SPADE
Hello Tom Got them
POLHAUS
(nods )
Got them
SPADE
Swell Heres another one for you
(he pushes Brigid forward)
She killed Miles -- and Ive got

some exhibits

He goes to the closet unlocks the door steps into
the closet

SPADES VOICE
(from closet)
The boys guns and one of Cairos
-- and a thousand dollar bill I was
supposed to be bribed with

He comes out of the closet gives the guns to Polhaus

SPADE
And that black statuette on the
table there that all the fuss
was about

He turns to Dundy draws his brows together leans forward
to peer into the lieutenants face starts to laugh

SPADE
Whats the matter with your little
playmate Tom He looks heart-broken
I bet when he heard Gutmans story
he thought he had me at last

POLHAUS

(grumbles )
Cut it out Sam

(he looks uneasily

at his superior)
Anyway we got it from Cairo Gutmans
dead The kid had just finished
shooting him when we got there

SPADE
(nods )
Ought to have expected that
(picks up his
hat puts it on)
Shall we be getting down to the
Hall

Polhaus nods He picks up the Falcon Spade leads the way
out of the apartment Dundy takes out handcuffs snaps

them on the girls wrists They follow Spade out Brigids
face and movements are like a sleepwalkers

124 INT SPADES OUTER OFFICE - MORNING

Effie is not behind her desk The door opens and Spade
enters His face is dull pasty in color but its lines are
strong The door to the inner office is open and Spade
goes in CAMERA FOLLOWING

125 INT INNER OFFICE

Effie stands by the window The girls brown eyes are
peculiarly enlarged and theres a queer twist to her mouth
She watches him put his hat on the desk

SPADE
Morning Angel

Theres a copy of the Morning Express on the desk Spade
points to it grins

SPADE
(mockingly)
So much for your womans intuition

EFFIE
(in a queer tight voice)
You did that Sam to her

SPADE
Your Sams a detective

He looks sharply at her then goes over to her puts his
arm around her waist his hand on her hips

SPADE
She did kill Miles Angel
(snaps his fingers)
off-hand like that

The girl escapes from his arm

EFFIE
(brokenly )
Dont please I know youre
right but anyway

Spades face becomes lumpy Dull before it is leaden now
OVER SCENE the SOUND of the corridor door knob rattling
Effie Perine goes quickly into the outer office shutting
the door Spade remains standing by the window
leaden-faced staring -- at nothing After a moment the
door opens and Effie comes in again shutting it behind
her

EFFIE
(in a small flat voice)
Iva is here

Spade looking at nothing nods almost imperceptibly

SPADE
Yes
(he shivers -- then)
Well send her in

FADE OUT

THE END
