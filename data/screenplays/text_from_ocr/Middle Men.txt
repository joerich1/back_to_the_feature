Over the logo we hear the sound of rain and thunder
Trouble is already brewing

INT - JACK’S HOUSTON HOUSE - NIGHT

A lightning flash reveals the haggard worried face of
our hero JACK HARRIS In his early forties His house is
filled with expensive art perfectly appointed furniture
and high ceilings A fireplace rages making the room
dance with light We almost feel as if we’re in hell

DIANA his estranged wife a beautiful woman clutches a
towel She’s been crying buckets Her eyes are red and
swollen She holds her son ADAM about seven close ina
protective way It’s as if Jack is a stalking animal that
could do them both harm

Lightning flashes again Jack stands in front of a DUFFLE
BAG It is filled with PACKETS OF MONEY Hundreds and
hundreds of thousands Or is it millions He closes the
bag and locks it He looks at Diana and tries to
communicate from a place deep inside

JACK
I’m gonna get him back Diana

She doesn’t answer She stares with contempt and rage As
Jack begins to head out of the house

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
I had several million dollars in a duffle
bag and had to go and see a bunch of low
life Russian mobsters who would most
likely cut my throat take the money and
kill a kid they think is my son for
sport

EXT - JACK’S HOUSTON HOUSE - NIGHT

It’s just as beautiful as the inside surrounded by a
private gate Jack runs through the rain towards his
Mercedes with the DUFFLE BAG

JACK (V0)
It doesn’t get any more fucked up than
this I was dealing with the kind of
savages who’d beat their mothers to death
for a ham sandwich So I didn’t place my
odds as very good for seeing the sun come

up
Jack starts his car and begins pulling out of the
driveway as the gate opens up

JACK (VO) (CONT’D)
And why Because of what I had a hand in
creating No I didn’t cure AIDS or
cancer And I didn’t figure out a way to
stop war or end world hunger But I did
end up making a lot more money than if
Id done any of those great and lasting
things that would change the world for
the better

INT - JACK’S MERCEDES - NIGHT

Jack tries to light a cigarette His hands shake so
badly he can hardly do it

JACK (V0)

I had a hand in creating the greatest
invention of our time I inadvertently
changed the world My name is Jack
Harris and I figured out a better way
for guys to jerk off

Montage of shots through history

Pornographic sex masturbationdating back to caves
through the Kama Sutra

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
Men have been jerking off since the
beginning of time I mean it’s no
fucking secret

1950’s A young boy masturbating to beauties on the
Milton Berle show Betty Page etc His mother walks in
and begins screaming at him

JACK (VO) (CONT’D)
Why is this mother yelling at her kid
She should know better Men are always
thinking about sex About every ten
seconds some sick perverted degenerate
thought goes through a man’s mind

Through the 60’s 70’s and 80’s Different porn styles
women with big hairy bush John Holmes style guys mullet
beefcakes posing with porno babes
JACK (VO) (CONTD)
From the very moment a man figures out
his hand can reach his dick he’s
figuring out a new way to pull on it

A skateboard kid locks his door pops in a VHS cassette
Then through the 90’s hardcore porn on A DVD Stay on
the TV a US Senator now gives a speech on how he’s going
to clean up the world Later in his hotel room he jerks
it furiously while wearing women’s underwear

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
This should come as no big fucking
surprise Every guy gay or straight
prince or pauper kings presidents
heads of state every last one of them is
sneaking off somewhere and whacking it

A GOTH kid ties a rope around his neck jacking off He
finishes his feet can’t quite make it back to the chair
He’s choking and it’s clear he’s not going to make it

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
Look at this poor fucker His
inventiveness will be the thing that does
him in It’s been a preoccupation of men
since God knows when Still don’t believe
me Well look at this

A space shuttle is launched

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
This is the space shuttle It costs four
hundred and fifty million dollars every
time it’s launched by Uncle Sam and your
tax dollars Guess what’s on it

In space we see a satellite released into orbit

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
A billion dollar satellite And why do
you think they’re launching that thing
It’s all part of the Internet But if you
think that thing has anything to do with
helping your kids learn daddy reading
stats on Tiger Woods or Mommy and
Grandma learning how to bake the perfect
chocolate cake then you’re out of your
fucking mind Just follow the money The
porn industry takes in fifty seven
billion dollars a year worldwide With no
one ever admitting that they watch
We see a farmhouse right out of an Andrew Wyeth painting
A farmer done from plowing his field heads merrily up
the stairs into his house

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
This is going on every second of every
day all over the world

Inside the house his wife right out of a Norman
Rockwell painting is baking an apple pie Two angelic
kids beam when the pie is placed on the table to cool
off

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
Millions and millions and millions of
horny frustrated guys escaping into
porn dream land

In the other room the farmer has a laptop computer
running wireless Internet We PAN to the modemport
which creates a laser beamwe follow it up out of the
house into space where the laser bounces off the
satellite and comes shooting back down to earth

JACK (VO) (CONT’D)
It’s a land of women gorgeous women who
don’t know the meaning of the word “no”

It shoots off another giant satellite dish and fires back
out hundreds of miles into a cable compound which shoots
the beam from miles away back into the modemportAND
THEN

The farmer sitting in front of his computer undoes his
overalls A porn scene plays on his laptopHe smiles
wide-eyed

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
Pure Americana

a booth in the back where Nikita Buck and Wayne all seem
to be best friends They are wedged in between other
strippers and a few of the Russian bouncers

JACK (VO)
Within ten minutes these idiots thought
they were best friends with the Russian
mob and agreed to strike a deal to split
everything down the middle for the life
of their new partnership Only these guys
didn’t quite understand the nuances of
being partners with the Russian Mob

The boys shake hands with Nikita and the rest of the
Russians They all raise their glasses in a toast Wayne
turns to the nearly naked Ukrainian dancer sitting at his
side

CYNTHIA

JACK (VO)
Haggerty I was sure his big plan was to
have me fix the Russian problem get the
business up and running and then figure
out a way to rip it off Knowing
Haggerty he already had that part
figured out He was already being
investigated by the feds and stunk of
desperation If this was real and I was
going to get involved he could not be a
part of this no matter what

Jack knocks on the door to the suite He hears rustling
on the other side

BUCK (0S)
Who is it

JACK
Jack Harris

The door opens Buck checks him out and pulls him inside

INT - HARD ROCK HOTEL SUITE - DAY 62

The place is enormous It looks like a bomb hit it
filled with room service carts and piles of cigarette
butts that spill out everywhere and onto the floor It’s
real “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” type stuff Wayne
comes up behind Jack and tosses him into the wall
putting a gun to his head He pulls back the hammer Buck
jumps in the way

BUCK
He’s okay He’s okay

Wayne’s eyes are nearly bugging out of his head

WAYNE
How do you know How do you know You
don’t know what the guy looks like

Wayne starts patting Jack down He takes Jack’s wallet
and checks his ID He looks at it then tosses it back to
Jack

BUCK
Don’t mind him he’s been up for eleven
straight days

Jack turns and gets his first good look at Wayne He is
dressed only in a robe which periodically opens up his
dick hanging out This makes Jack visibly uncomfortable

WAYNE
It doesn’t mean I don’t see things with
clarity man I’m a sharp motherfucker
I’m sharp as a tack These little fuckers
are all over the hotel

BUCK
There aren’t any little fuckers

WAYNE
Oh bullshit

in the hotel

Wayne rushes over waving the gun around

WAYNE
Little fuckers Little fuckers with tiny
little assholes that shit these little
fucking hearts and clovers I see them
all over the place Behind the cabinets
Under the fucking bed And they’re
listening devices man

BUCK

JACK
Guys this room stinks

Jack looks at Buck

JACK (CONTD)
You seem to be the brains of this outfit
You both need something to eat

BUCK
I know he won’t let anybody else up to
the room

WAYNE
Damn straight We’ve got Russians after
us You don’t think they’ve got Russians
working in the kitchen They’1l poison
the food RightRightAm I Right

JACK
Ill eat the food first If it’s good
I’1l hand it over to you

WAYNE
Bullshit What if I get a bad bite

BUCK
He’s afraid we’re gonna get cracked We
owe these Russians money

JACK
Whacked Not “cracked” whacked Jesus
And you owe Nikita Sokoloff money
probably the last guy on Earth youd ever
want to fuck around with What were you
guys thinking

BUCK
I dunno We weren’t We just had all this
money coming in I mean more money than
we’d ever seen

JACK
Why didn’t you just pay them

Wayne starts waving his hands around

WAYNE
Bees Bees man Bees You hear them

BUCK
Wayne I am telling you for the last
time Shut the fuck up I can’t hear

WAYNE

Buck grabs a remote control FIRES IT off Waynes head
He charges him and TACKLES him to the floor A gruesome
sight as Waynes robe is entirely open as they roll
around

Jacks eyes BULGE

He then calmly gets out of his chair and grabs a
champagne bucket filled with melting ice water He
throws it on the two men dousing them

The guys SHRIEK roll off each other out of breath

JACK
Guys Lets focus on why were here

Jack sits in a CHAIR across from them still on the
floor A beat

BUCK
We’re so fucking dead aren’t we

JACK
No But you’ve got to clean up And tell
me everything

CUT TO

INT - HARD ROCK HOTEL SUITE - DAY 63

It’s an hour later There is a brand new room service
cart there Buck has clearly convinced Wayne to eat The
situation appears to be calming down as Buck and Wayne
do their best to explain everything to Jack

JACK (VO)
The amazing thing to me was that they had
started a business that already could
have made more millions than I could
imagine in such a short time Instead of
paying they hid out in a hotel suite
and spilled more coke than most people
were capable of doing in a lifetime

(MORE)

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
I figured that had they kept their shit
together for just the last two months
they might be worth millions So maybe
this wouldn’t be so tough to fix after
all

WAYNE
Look youve got to take care of this
Russian problem

JACK
First of all I don’t have to do a God
damn thing Got it

Buck and Wayne nod like children

Alright I need to figure out what you
did right Obviously something because
you made a million bucks in two months

I know what you did wrong you didn’t pay
your partners And based upon what I see
here today I can safely assume that you
don’t have the common sense that Christ
gave a cockroach on how to run a

business

WAYNE
But you do right

JACK
Right

BUCK

So will you do that for us

JACK

Not so fast I won’t make money by
creating porn I’ve got a family I don’t
have any interest in being a
pornographer If I’m going to come on we
will never provide porn again

(Thinking out loud)
You guys figured out how to take a credit
card from a person anywhere in the world
and then deliver a product anywhere in
the world and neither side sees each
other Its genius for sure This is
where the money is long term We just
need to deliver the porn into homes all
over the world process the payment and
take a cut

BUCK
What do you mean

WAYNE
Im not sure I understand

JACK
Imagine theres a basement and in this
basement theres a Chinese orgy

FLASH CUT TO

JACK (VO)

pornographers overseas And what would it
show up on your credit card bill as

The divorce rate is high enough in this
country without wives having proof that
their husbands are spending money on
filthyasianwhorescom

BACK TO

INT - HARD ROCK HOTEL SUITE - SAME 66

Buck and Wayne are like two mesmerized children staring
at Jack like hes a genius

BUCK
We could have hundreds of sitesmaybe
even thousands all under some
nondescript name

JACK
Exactly if I get a credit card bill and
it says big tits dot com I may have some
buyers remorse but if it says software
billing company then who knows what that
means It’s safer for everyone concerned
Win Win Consumers get what they want
content providers get what they want and
we make ten percent for handling the
transaction

WAYNE
Yeah then we could take a cut from all
of those people out there that are
already making it Be in the middle
Fucking middle men

BUCK
Its limitless man God damn limitless

JACK
Potentially We have no downside other
than your Russian partners

BUCK
Where does Haggerty fit in

JACK
I’m not so sure about Haggerty

BUCK
Why He put us together That would be
kind of shitty to cut him out

JACK
Look he’s probably going to be indicted
any time now He’s got federal agents all
over him

BUCK
He told us he was never even going to be
charged

JACK
This is already a questionable business
I don’t think it’s wise to team up with
someone who is under investigation We’1l
have federal agents all over us too

BUCK
Look what you’re saying makes sense But
I just don’t feel right about it This
guy’s saving our life

JACK
Get something straight I’m saving your
life I’m the one that’s gonna have to
deal with these Russians not Jerry
Haggerty

BUCK
Yeah but

Wayne looks at Buck cuts him off

Ivan glances at a framed photo of Jack and his son

IVAN (CONTD)

Ivan picks up the picture frame Jack clenches his jaw
with contempt

Jack opens the blinds to the deck revealing James REGGIE
and PEANUT with his very large African American
wrecking crew They stroll into the living room and
quickly have Ivan surrounded

IVAN (CONTD)

JACK
Lets focus on why were here

up It’s stuffed with many packets of hundreds Ivan does
a quick count of a single packet

He scans the packets counting his lips moving as he
WHISPERS NUMBERS IN RUSSIAN

Ivan nods and then smiles

IVAN
Okay This is good Deal

Ivan reaches out his hand They shake

As they shake hands from out of nowhere James punches
Ivan square in the nose We hear a crunch blood flies
everywhere Ivan barely blinks as blood runs down his
face

stares at him skeptically for a moment

Ivan dialsputs the phone to his ear After a moment
Ivan suddenly relaxes

IVAN
It is machine

Ivan clicks off the phone and extends it back to Jack

JACK
Oh I guess well try again later

As Jack grabs the phone he feels it is wet Jack looks
down and sees his fingers are stained with blood So is

from Ivan’s ear Jack is suddenly terrified even though
Ivan seems to be doing very well with his arm around
Wayne

IVAN
I like you You always make me laugh

WAYNE
Yeah we’re friends right Right

Jack nudges James and motions with his chin towards
Ivan’s ear James’s face changes instantly

As Ivan is talking to Wayne his eyes roll up in his
head He begins to slur his words as blood and puss pour
from his ear He collapses to the floor foaming from the
mouth His right leg kicks violently smashing the coffee
table to bits Wayne stares in shock

WAYNE (CONTD)
Oh Jesus Christ

with a parade of producers directors and porn stars

Jack looks into CAMERA He is being interviewed In some
ways he’s a different person Impeccably dressed oozing
money and power He’s clearly become a rock star

JACK
What I think we’ve done better than
anyone is match the product which is on
one side and make it more accessible to
the consumer who is on the other side We
keep the entire interaction discreet and
professional We never forget for one
moment that this is a business And like
all businesses we exist by satisfying
both our content providers and our
content subscribers

OVER A PARADE OF IMAGES OF PEOPLE ON THE RED CARPET

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
You know the more time you spend around
all this stuff the more normal it
becomes It’s a world without any
filters It may be crass and in your
face but there is something incredibly
honest about all of it The outside world
becomes increasingly strange and lame
You know that most of the outside world
is looking down their nose at you but
you also know at the same exact time if
they were really honest with themselves
they’d kill to be on the inside with you

AUDREY
It’s a long storybut I’m having fun
Certain people are just good at certain
things I’m good at all kinds of things

JACK
Apparently not

AUDREY
I think there’s just too much emphasis on
guilt All this guilt guilt guilt
Guilt for what I’1l1 bet if you ask any
old timer in one of those old folks
homes they’d tell you they regret the
stuff they didn’t do Not the stuff that
they did do

Jack listens

EXT - PATIO - NIGHT 108

Jack steps outside to get a breath of fresh air The
lights of Vegas glisten in the background A few people
mill around

Suddenly Jack spots Haggerty who stands almost in the
shadows talking to a young porn starlet

Haggerty excuses himself and moves over to Jack

HAGGERTY
Hey Jack Things seem to be going well
for you huh

JACK
Yeah Jerry What are you doing here

HAGGERTY

Haggerty lights up a Cuban cigar and blows a perfect
smoke ring

HAGGERTY (CONTD)

hundred grand up front before I even
knew if there was a deal didn’t I

making All the money and no Jerry

JACK

HAGGERTY
Oh that’1l never stick Jack You know I’m

the money You’re not greedy Jack We
both know you’ve already made enough

married guy Jack I mean I guess that’s
not saying much by today’s standards

But you’re like a throwback an actual
faithfully married man So what is it
What’s keeping you around

JACK
Why don’t you just enjoy the party and
stop thinking so much

Haggerty laughs There’s hidden meaning to his laugh

HAGGERTY
Oh but I just can’t help myself I love
to think I love hearing my brain go
clickity clickity click

Jack nods and moves past him Haggerty follows him
inside

Jack moves over to Audrey They begin to talk business
Porn starlets begin to gather around the conversation
It’s obvious they are the center of attention

Jack spots Haggerty talking with Buck and Wayne It
clearly bothers him

JACK (VO)
I had a real problem with Haggerty The
only reason he would tell me that he
Buck and Wayne still talked is to put
some kind of fear into me But how much
did he know Buck and Wayne couldn’t be
stupid enough to tell him about the dead
Russian Or could they I mean could
anyone be that stupid

ANGLE ON Buck and Wayne who watch from the other side of
the room with little attention being thrown their way
from ANYONE at the party

WAYNE
You ever get the feeling this partnership
ain’t such a real partnership

BUCK
He’s like Mick Jagger and we’re like a
couple of roadies

WAYNE
Yeah that’s how he treats us Like
were roadies right

BUCK
Oh relax We’re rich aren’t we

JACK (VO)
Yeah they were rich alright But

their shit is going to be taken away from
them

Haggerty walks a few feet away and taps DENNY Z 30 on

the back Denny Z is thin with greasy black hair If
Ichabod Crane was a pornographer he’d be Denny

JACK (VO) (CONT’D)
Denny Z was a bottom feeder and a
complete scumbag The kind of person
youd be embarrassed to spend time with
In this business that’s saying a lot

Haggerty walks Denny over to Buck and Wayne

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
He was also the kind of guy that after
you shook his hand you wanted to boil
yours

Denny shakes hands with Buck and then Wayne

HAGGERTY
Gentlemen this is the legendary Denny
ZOne of the best producers out there
His site is something you should really
look into

DENNY Z

sick-ass portal for my premium members

dirty martini with three olives in her hand James stands
above the table James and Jack clasp hands James

with them

JAMES
Good to see you back
JACK
It’s good to be back
JAMES
Like old times
(to Audrey)

I remember him before he was such a big
shot He was just a little shot then

They all laugh

AUDREY
How’d you get this place

JACK
Well I’m living in Houston and I get a
call from a friend to take over for a
while because he got ill I came out here
and very quickly figured out that
everybody was ripping this place off I
fired a whole bunch of people and turned
the place around my friend couldn’t work
any more so now its mine

sits
AUDREY
Not surprising

JACK
With a club you’ve got to keep your eye
on everything It’s a cash business and
everyone’s looking to rip you off

JAMES
That’s why he’s got me See if anybody
steal’s from him I go and kick their
ass I can’t have any crooks or thieves
around here because I’m too busy
stealing from Jack myself

They laugh again James spots the bartender pocketing a
few dollars

JAMES (CONTD)
(re bartender)
Like that motherfucker right there

James gets up

JAMES (CONT’D)
Excuse me

James heads off towards the bar

AUDREY
So let me guess you start to spend less
and less time at home Your wife and kids
become strangers to you and now you find
yourself lost and confused with a twenty
three year old pornstar Accurate

JACK
You make it sound so cliche

AUDREY
Well it is isn’t it It’s the oldest
story in the world It’s a carbon copy of
my house growing up Absentee father
Working all the time A self obsessed
mother Fifty trying to look twenty
five Cocktails at noon Eight vicodins a
day Her idea of a well rounded
conversation usually consisted of deep
questions like “Do I look puffy”

Jack laughs

Suddenly there is a commotion over by the bar

ANGLE ON James roues the bartender lifting him up by
his shirt The bartender pleads with him

BARTENDER
It was a tip I swear it was a tip

James looks around at everyone in the bar All eyes are
on them James slowly puts the bartender back down onto
his feet and cleans him up

We go back to Jack and Audrey

AUDREY
I keep waiting for that inevitable
question

JACK

What question is that

AUDREY
Oh you know How did I choose this line
of work How did a beautiful girl like me
who’s obviously smart jump into the porn
business with both pumps

JACK
Well since you brought it upyeah I’m
curious

AUDREY

I was a tech geek going to college to be
a software engineer Trying to get as far
away from my mother as possible I could
build websites better and faster than
anyone Some of my girlfriends and I
stripped on the side to put ourselves
through school and then one of them asked
me to build her a website So I did When
I saw the money that she made from it I
knew it was the goldrushI had to
jump in I would do almost anything for
money to make myself independent It was
a very easy decision

Jack looks at her realizing that Audrey has an eerily
similar story to his own

JACK
Wowa tech geek

AUDREY
Ive got an IQ that tests off the charts
No bullshit I’m in MENSA

JACK
Impressive

Audrey smiles and sips her drink She looks at Jack She
leans over to kiss him Jack resists

DIANA (CONTD)

Jack gazes out the window saying nothing until

JACK
You know when I was a kid we were broke
all the time I know I’ve told you this a
thousand times but lately I’ve been
thinking a lot about my father He always
put food on the table but I knew even
as a little kid he was making miracles
happen That everything he was doing
came from this minute by minute kind of
thinking He had no education and no
fear

DIANA
Well you seem to survive well ina
chaotic universe

Jack nods

Jack and Diana are in bed Jack reaches for her
hands meet She turns over and faces him They look into

each other’s eyes Jack wanting to find redemption Diana
wanting things to be as they were They kiss

JACK
Yeah well that’s one of my talents

create a big mess so you feel at home

JACK
What are you saying

DIANA
You’re so much better than this

JACK
What am I doing wrong

DIANA
You don’t know

JACK
No Not really

DIANA
It’s just so horrible that I can’t tell
people what you do

JACK
And why is that important to you

DIANA
It’s not important to you What about our
children How do you think they’re going
to handle it When they find out what
their daddy does

I think we have I assume they’ll be

JACK (VO)
So now I’m flying back to LA I’m feeling
like it’s pretty much over between me and

lifestyle of money sex and power that
was light years away from family or
anything I had ever experienced

INT - LIMOUSINE - DAY 116

Jack looks out the back of the limo as he rides around
the streets of LA

JACK (VO)
You see the biggest problem with my
addiction was that like all addictions
it sneaks up on you slowly You give into
it incrementally In an almost
imperceptible way The other thing about
it was that it wasn’t the kind of

The limo pulls up to Audrey’s house Jack gets out
JACK (V0)
It wasn’t the kind of thing that would
rob you of your life It didn’t rob you
of your wealth
Jack walks up the path and knocks on the door
JACK (VO) (CONTD)
The more I indulged the richer it would
make me I’ve got to tell you that’s
impossible to give up

The door opens to reveal Audrey She is a vision

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
So I gave in

CUT TO

INT - AUDREY’S HOUSE BEDROOM - DAY 118

Audrey’s head rests on his chest

With every heartbeat Jack looks more conflicted

Jack sits up The curtains ruffle in the breeze Jack
watches them

AUDREY
I can hear your thoughts

JACK
I believe you You dont have to tell
them to me

A LONG BEAT

AUDREY
You like post orgasm silence huh

JACK
Dont we all

Audrey smiles at him

AUDREY
Aww you’re so sweet Jack You dont have
to be mean just ‘cause you feel so
guilty Do you need me to let you off the
hook

JACK
Despite what you think you dont have
that kind of power

AUDREY
Dont kid yourself Im younger Im
hotterYou like my pussy way more
because its tighter and prettier

JACK
Why the poetry

AUDREY
It’s one of my weaknesses I hide behind
my wit when I sense an attack coming

JACK
Well brace yourself

He kisses her They begin to kiss passionately

EXT - HOLLYWOOD PARK RACETRACK ESTABLISHING - DAY

It’s a sunny day

INT - EXECUTIVE CLUB - CONTINUOUS

Jack sits at a table with Audrey They are looking at
racing forms

JACK
You actually know what all this stuff
means

AUDREY
Yeah this shows the horse’s past
performances This is the last time he
ran This indicates how often the horse
is run See This horse ran three times
in the last three weeks So it might be
tired And this horse here It runs well
on a sloppy track This shows the class
of horse Just because a horse won its
last few races doesn’t mean it’s going
to win against a different class of
horse

A waiter brings them a bottle of champagne

Jack turns

JACK
We didn’t order this

WAITER

NIKITA

Jack turns and sneaks a peak at the table Two big guys
in suits CURT ALLMAN and BILL ROMERO pretend to be
reading their racing forms

NIKITA (CONTD)
They’re also terrible actors They stick
out like sore thumb don’t you think

JACK
That doesn’t mean they’re following me

NIKITA

Do you see the man seated at the table
next to them The one on the cell phone
That’s my cousin Yuri They follow me
He follows them He called me a moment
ago and said they were talking about you
Not me Isn’t that refreshing Maybe
they tuck you in tonight no

JACK
There’s no reason for them to be
following me I’m just a business man

Nikita laughs heartily

NIKITA
Aren’t we all

Nikita waves across the room at Audrey She returns the
wave

JACK
You know her

NIKITA

Jack returns to the table and sits down by Audrey

AUDREY

HAGGERTY

Jack takes a few steps inside and looks around It’s
empty except for a TV on a box and an old sofa

HAGGERTY (CONTD)
I’m sorry there’s no place to sit I’m
having the house remodeled

JACK
Youre Sokoloff’s lawyer

HAGGERTY
Well yeah in a manner of speaking

JACK
Don’t fuck around with me Jerry

HAGGERTY
Yeah yeah of course I’m his lawyer
How do you think I found out about this
situation in the first place

Jack looks Haggerty right in the eye

JACK
You’re the one that ripped me off

HAGGERTY
What are you talking about

JACK
With that big fucking Russian Ivan That
was you I know it was you He came to my
house and asked me for double what was
owed and some of that was meant for you

HAGGERTY
Alright alright So I tried to take a
little skim for Christ’s sakes You’re
making what

(MORE)

HAGGERTY (CONTD)
Close to a hundred million now And you
throw me chump change That ain’t right
Jack And what do I get “Thanks for
putting this all together Jerry” That
ain’t right and you know it
motherfucker

JACK
No your his lawyer MOTHERFUCKER he
should take care of you out of his end

HAGGERTY
Aw shit Jack I owed them money I
borrowed money from them on some shit
that didn’t go right I owed them so much
money they were beating the crap out of
me and using me for my legal services
Then Ivan the one who ripped both of us
off it was his job to come over and
collect Sometimes I had the money
sometimes I didn’t

JACK
You stay away from me I’ve paid my debt
to you

HAGGERTY
Yeah well that ain’t the way I see it
Jack

JACK

I’m serious You and me are finished
Jack starts heading for the door

HAGGERTY
We’re not finished We can’t be You’re
the one that killed Ivan right

Jack stops He turns slowly

JACK
What did you just say

HAGGERTY
I mean you must have killed him He’s
gone Vanished Like into thin air

JACK
It’s pretty obvious to me he took the
money and left

HAGGERTY
Yeah I thought that too for a while But
I don’t think he would just run off with
four hundred and fifty thousand dollars
I mean he might try to start a new life
with four or five million but not chump
change like that It doesn’t make any
sense I know you had something to do
with it

JACK
If you even suspected it youd be
bleeding me dry by now

HAGGERTY
Either that or waiting to catch the big
fish

Jack moves over to Jerry

JACK
If you even think of repeating this
conversation I mean even in jest I
swear to God Jerry Ill throw you off a
fucking roofI didn’t kill anybody

organization who are big fans of your
website

FLASH CUT

126 INT - GERMAN APARTMENT - DAY 126

my guidance Now what I didn’t know at
the time was that they had finally put
together what Denny Z was up to with
their new secret website

WAYNE

ROMERO

but they’re incredibly homophobic
Second they enjoy sites with military

themes
JACK
Military themes
ROMERO
Girls posing with guns and the like
JACK
Okay
ALLMAN

So here is what the government is
recommending We recommend that Audrey
open up a new section to her site under a
separate payment plan

ANGLE ON the outside of Jack’s office Buck and Wayne
sneak up and begin listening in

ROMERO
A portal

ALLMAN
We will then monitor the activity to that
portal through you We feel this will be
most effective

ANGLE ON Buck and Wayne outside the office They whisper
to each other

WAYNE
Oh shit oh shit What the fuck are we
gonna do We gotta do something We gotta
do something right

HAGGERTY
Minors fucking on a website Oh that’s

girls are sixteen or seventeen or
something like that

HAGGERTY
I’m not so sure the government shares
your gift of nuance A minor’s a minor

BUCK
So what do we do

HAGGERTY
You two knuckleheads should dump this
Denny Z and get as far away from this as
you can

BUCK
What Your the fucking guy who introduced
him to ustold us to get into business
with him

HAGGERTY
That I do not recall but its really
irrelevant now isnt it

manila envelope from his briefcase Its stamped and
addressed to the Houston Chronicle

JACK (CONTD)
Now God forbid this were to fall into the
wrong hands and end up on the front page

attention

ROBIN
We want to start a new series of films

Jack heads into the living room It’s a tangle of flesh
Close to twenty people fucking in all positions in the
darkness and intermittent light It’s like Dante’s
Inferno

Jack moves through the crowds of sexual partners

He moves to the dining room Couples are on tables
Chairs Up against walls

He moves through the kitchen More fucking Couples play
with whipped cream

Jack moves past them and back into the hall More couples
fucking Everywhere

the turn and heads for a bedroom

Inside the bedroom is a melee of fucking drinking and
drug use A pile of cocaine on the night stand

Jack backs out slowly Almost apologetically

He crosses the bedroom Down the stairs
Down the hall to the backyard

Through the door Outside is Denny Z talking to two
pornstars

Jack grabs Denny Z

DENNY Z
Hey what the hell are you doing

Jack begins beating the shit out of him He keeps hitting
Denny until he’s a bloody pulp Denny spits blood out of
his mouth

DENNY Z (CONTD)

Jack sees that Denny has a gun in his belt Jack takes
the gun away from Denny and fires a shot through Denny’s
foot Denny screams in agonizing pain Jack tosses the
gun and heads back into the house leaving Denny
screaming behind him

Jack goes back into the house He heads back down the
hall to the bottom of the staircase Something catches
his eye

He moves slowly back towards the living room His face
changes

It’s Audrey Dawn She’s about to take on two guys in the
middle of the floor

He stares

Jack leaves the house

JACK
Did it ever occur to you that maybe both
of us have just switched off a part of
our souls

AUDREY
And what part is that

JACK
The part that’s supposed to question this
kind of behavior

AUDREY
You’re not going to start moralizing are
you Jack you’ve made all this money
because of all the horny frustrated guys
out there who have to jerk off because
their wives and girlfriends don’t treat
them right So I become their little
fantasy girl for five minutes a pop and
make them forget for a fleeting instant
that their wives and kids can’t stand the
fucking sight of them No I’m not going
to feel guilty about that and my soul is
perfectly in fucking tact

Jack says nothing

AUDREY (CONT’D)
You know what I’m starting to think I’m
starting to think that you’re full of
shit I dont need to be hereI really
dont Why so you can get a call in the
middle of the night from your bitchy wife
that one of your spoiled kids may not be
able to take part in the local regatta at
some prep school homecoming I dont need
that in my life I dont need you

JACK
Your bags are already packed Audrey

Audrey stops Tears fill her eyes

AUDREY

JACK
We dont belong anywhere near each other

AUDREY

JACK
Happy You have another word

Audreys face contorts with sadness and rage She then
throws her wine glass at Jacks face He blocks it
cutting his hand

AUDREY
Fine Not the first time Ive had my
fucking bags packed ya know

JACK
And it wont be your last

Audrey heads inside wheels out TWO SUITCASES

AUDREY
Dont bother to help me you piece of
shit Your a real gentleman

JACK
Good news is I wont feel guilty about
it

She SCREAMS before heading out and SLAMMING THE DOOR so
hard that one Jacks pictures falls off the mantle in the
hallway and shatters

Jack gets up and walks to the hallway locks the front
door On his way back he stops and picks up the broken
picture frame

CU FRAME -- A younger Jack and Diana with their small
children Jack fights back his emotionsHe walks with
the broken picture out to his back deckHe takes a seat
in a chair and just stares endlessly into the distant
lights of San Pedro

JACK (VO) (CONTD)
I came to the conclusion that I wanted
out I mean desperately I just didn’t
know how I caught myself doing something
I hadn’t done in a long time Praying I
was wondering if there was any good out
there in the universe that could hear me
or if whoever it was decided a long time
ago that I wasn’t worth listening to
