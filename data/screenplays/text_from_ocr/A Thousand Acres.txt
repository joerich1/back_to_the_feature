A THOUSAND ACRES

screenplay by Laura Jones

based on the novel by Jane Smiley

Third draft

June 1996
GINNY
(VO)
Every story when we were children
revealed a lesson

A sweep of fertile farmiand so immense that we question if it isn’t infinite
lies undeniably flat under its dome of sky in dawn’s early light

We move to take in the figure of a man working in a field a large man in his
seventies LARRY COOK works at his early morning chores as Ss naturally asa
fish swims in water in his element

GINNY
(VO cont)
“work hard” “respect your elders”
“don’t tell your neighbours your
business” “luck is something you make
for yourself” Each acre

-GINNY
(VO cont)
was something to covet

The same dawn light shows GINNY COOK as she comes into a large old spic-
and-span four-square kitchen She does her chores as naturally as her father
does his taking her apron from behind door tying it on and starting Daddy’s
breakfast

GINNY
(VO cont)
something hard to get and that you
couldn’t get enough of The soil was the
treasure thicker richer than any soil
anywhere A farm
We walk with Ginny down between two tall shelves of library books

GINNY
(VO cont)
is full of poisons Arsenic in old rat-
poison kerosene and diesel fuel paint
thinner atrazine insecticides

Her hand along spines She stops skims shelves hunkers down and pulls out
a book the title page only glimpsed POISONOUS COMMON PLANTS Pages
turn we briefly glimpse botanical illustrations

GINNY
(VO cont)
mistletoehorse-nettle
English ivy

In a secluded dip where the Scenic River spreads out into a little marsh
under willows and silver maples amongst a rich tangle of marsh plants and
river grasses

Ginnys hands in yellow dish-washing gloves pull on a tall erect plant
GINNY
(VO cont)
and the most poisonous of all

It comes up satisfyingly whole by the roots

Ginny disappears from the river bank leaving it in perfect peace of goldeny
late-afternoon light

GINNY
(vO)

I have to admit I relished the secrecy of
it

Dawn’s early light

Ginny picks two heavy cool cabbages She stands one held in either hand

Briefly we see various stages

A fork holds down the hemlock root on a piece of paper a paring knife
mincing the root

Minced root tipped from paper into bowl of pork-liver and onions and herbs

Sausage casings filled with the poisoned liver being tied every six inches
thick as a man’s thumb

Preserving jar of sausages packed in cabbage and brine lifted into sterilizing
pan on stove

Farm bounty on the kitchen table glowing yellows of peaches greens of
pickles reds of tomatoes Amongst them the jar of poisoned sausages

GINNY
(VO)
Since then I’ve often thought that I
“wasnt myself” was “out of my mind”
but at the time it did it felt like the “real
me”

GINNY
(VO)
A few months earlier it would
have been unthinkable

Light of Spring day in Rose’s kitchen as Rose ladles swiss steak into serving
dish She wears a loose shirt but if we care to notice she hasn’t yet put the
prosthetic into her bra

GINNY
(VO)
Ive gone over every moment of
that time

Briefly in bathroom we see Rose pick up her prosthetic and tuck it into her
bra

road a toy house from here

looking for ways of knowing how
to do things differently from the
way they gotdone

Rose into Ginny’s car The easy intimacy of sisters

ROSE
Swiss steak for the prodigal son

GINNY
You look good

Nothing like a scandal to’ make me feel

Scandal

ROSE
What would you call it Who else but
Jess Clark has ever left here without a
word disappeared off the face of the
“ earth and then popped up out of the
blue thirteen years later

i enormous silent sweep of land as we pull up away taking the measure on
a this kingdom of a thousand acres

We move through a crowd of all ages around Harold Clark’s farmhouse
where most of the district is gathered to welcome back Jess Clark although
many won’t quickly lose their suspicions of him why he went why he’s
returned

A pig roasting

A knot of admiring men mostly farmers around a brand-new enclosed air-
conditioned International Harvester tractor includes JESS CLARK his brother
LOREN local banker MARV CARSON and a farmer BOB STANLEY

MARV
Your dad can’t wait to see Larry Cooks
face when he sees this

JESS
Are those two still at it

At the same time EILEEN DAHL a woman in her mid-thirties has comeup
to Jess almost flirtatious

EILEEN

Weil look at you Jess Clark None of us
knew what to expect Eileen Dahl don’t
you remember I’m hurt

At the same time Loren entertains the group

LOREN
I notice Jess waited till Dad and me
busted our butts finishing up planting
before he staged his resurrection

Laughter as
BOB
You bring any family with you
Jess
JESS

No Bob No wife no kids

HAROLD CLARK second in importance to Larry Cook in the district
hierarchy has joined the group

LOREN
Lots of good looking girls out West

HAROLD
And no plans to go back neither

And Harold’s arm goes around Jess’s shoulders for a brief embrace But Jess’s
gaze has gone out of the group to

Ginny and Rose carrying their casserole dishes walking through the crowd
side by side

Rose sees Jess leaving the group around the tractor coming towards them

ROSE
Hunh Look at that

Ginny follows her look

Jess who looks like nobody else here an envoy from the outside world
dangerous yet familiar

Their two casseroles go down side by side on the big trestle table

JESS
Hey it’s the big girls

He hugs Ginny then Rose

ROSE
Hey it’s the pest

JESS
Caroline liked me Did she come

GINNY
Caroline’s down in Des Moines now
Jess she’s a lawyer Shes getting married
in the fall to another lawyer she’s

Ginny stops conscious of sounding serious dull

JESS
Caroline married

ROSE
She’s not a baby Jess According to
Daddy it’s almost too late to breed her
You know sows and heifers and empty
chambers It’s a whole theoretical

system

He’s still like that

ROSE
You shouldn’t think anythings changed
just because you haven’t seen it for
thirteen years

Jess looks at Rose but Rose is never embarrassed

GINNY
I guess you remember Rose always says
what she thinks

ROSE
And I remember that Jess used to like
his Moms swiss steak

Rose lifts lid on her dish Jess looks in

JESS
I haven’t eaten meat in seven years

ROSE
And you’ve come back Theres Eileen
Dahl Ginny I have to go say hello
Youll starve to death around here

Instead of watching Rose leave Jess lifts the lid on Ginny’s dish cheese
garbanzo enchiladas

JESS
I guess I won’t

Ginny can’t help feeling pleased that she got it right Jess will eat the food she
made

GINNY
Here’s Caroline now

They look over to see CAROLINE TY and PETE getting out of Daddy’s car
with the two girls PAMMY and LINDA

Ginny and Jess walk through the crowd towards Daddy’s car as

GINNY

GINNY
We don’t have any And there’s Daddy
of course

As Daddy sees Jess and Ginny coming towards him he lowers his head fora
moment like an old bull as he eyes Jess Then he straightens and gives anod
of recognition his version of a greeting to this wayward son

As Daddy moves into the party being greeted on all sides it is clear he is king
of the district

(VO)
When I was little I thought it right that
we owned the great circle of land
spreading out from the intersection at
Cabot Road

Briefly we see - from eight year old Ginny’s point of view - part of the 360
degree view of the thrillingly flat landscape as she turns at the heart of the
kingdom taking it in

GINNY
(VO cont)
A thousand acres Daddy was the biggest
farmer on the biggest farm in the
district It was that simple
O

Almost dusk now in Harold Clark’s yard

A few little children impromptu dancing as someone plays a harmonica The
party thinning out Goodbyes as people continue to leave

In the fading light a small group sitting on Harold’s back porch Daddy
holding court in the centre with Ty and Pete Caroline and Rose in semi-circle
around him

DADDY
- and when prices are up people always
act like they’re going to live forever -

A group of girls including Pammy and Linda are placing their hands on the
long hair of a seated girl in charged silence

Ginny moving around picking up used plates and forks passes the girls then

notices the little group on the back porch

Rose turning looking for Ginny
Caroline smiles waves Ginny over
Ginny goes to the porch steps to hear

DADDY
So there you have it Thats the plan

GINNY
What plan Daddy

Daddy glances down at Ginny then at Caroline and keeping his eyes on
Caroline

DADDY
Were going to form a corporation and
you girls are all going to have shares

Now he looks at Ginny who comes up on to the porch perplexed by this
plan does the sun go round the earth

DADDY
You girls and Ty and Pete and Frank are
going to run the show You’ Ul each have
a third
He looks around at his little court expansive

Lo

DADDY
Well What do you say

‘He slowly looks in turn at each of his daughters
And one by one

GINNY
It’s a good idea Daddy

ROSE
It’s a great idea

CAROLINE
don’t know

Daddy turns to look fully at Caroline next to him slow and startled a big
movement of his whole body

iS Caroline looks away out to the darkening horizon mute stubborn
Daddy stands
DADDY
You don’t want it my girl you’re out

Simple as that

Daddy leaves the circle lumbers past Ginny and down the porch steps into
the thickening dusk

Daddy his empty house silent behind him stands at his big living room
windows He stares out full of hurt resentment across the road to
Rose’s house a few lit windows As a downstairs light goes off

Co Caroline’s hand leaves the light-switch the room lit only by a lamp beside the

sofa

Sound from upstairs of Pammy practising her flute Pete and Linda moving
around their voices Pete’s wordless singing briefly to the flute

ROSE
Sleeping here’s only going to make
Daddy madder

CAROLINE
Daddy changes his whole life overnight

ROSE
Take it while it’s on offer

But Caroline sets her mouth

ROSE
Do you remember - I was just
remembering - before Mommy died —
you were about five I guess and you
— said “When I grow up I’m not going
to be a farm wife” and Mommy was
cooking and she laughed and asked
you what you were going to be and
you said “A farmer”

CAROLINE
I don’t remember Mommy you know
that

Rose laughs at Caroline’s self-righteous tone Caroline turns off the lamp
‘Rose’s voice dry in the dark

ROSE
Sweet dreams

thought Larry’d do something like this
Those Slurrystores Ginny if this all
happens Id like one of those And a
hog confinement building Air

And let’s see how about a couple of
champion boars breeding so pure they
can sit up to dinner with you and not
spill a drop on the cloth Sweet old pink
boys named Rockerfeller andVanderbilt

Ty now lying on the bed his strong arms up behind his head sunburn lines
clear on upper arms and neck
TY
This is it Ginny this is where we stop
working for your dad and start working
for ourselves Itll be our place our way
of doing things
Ginny in the bathroom running water cleaning teeth half-hears Ty’s voice
from the bedroom
TY
(OS)
We get a good breeding line going and
we can put those babies up for adoption
We can say “Okay Jake but you got to
feed him with your own spoon and let
him sleep on your side of the bed”

She feels the spring breeze soughing like water in the pine-break Sound of
hogs clanking their feeders in the barn As she looks out over the peaceful
kingdom

Larger-than-life Christ - illuminated by a ray of light from the sky praying ina
big landscape - painted with naive boldness dominates the church behind the
altar

Ginny and Caroline almost the last to leave after Sunday service Ginny has
set herself the task of reconciliation

GINNY
Come along come out and give
him a kiss and a hug and just say
“Sorry Daddy” You can do that

CAROLINE
It’s too late I already spent the night at
Roses

GINNY

If he mentions it say “I was afraid
you were mad at me Daddy”

Caroline takes Ginny’s arm and turns her to walk down the aisle With
Caroline’s arm in hers Ginny suddenly feels hopeful that her task has been
well done

Stacks of papers with little red markers staggered down their pages lie in neat
fans on Daddy’s dark dining room table

Jess appears in the doorway glances in at the legal papers then out through
the window to

Far out in the fields we see a little concourse of cars and pick-ups

Ginny still in her church clothes prepares coffee in Daddy’s kitchen
Jess appears silently behind her
Unconscious of him she turns to the table with a stack of cups

Startled very close almost face to face she bumps into him He grips her
upper arm to give her balance She rescues the cups

His face is familiar and exotic at the same time friendly and interested but
strange promising knowledge

GINNY
Where did you spring from

JESS
(over)
Hey I didn’t mean to scare you

He lets go her arm and unsettled by the sudden intimacy she continues to
prepare coffee

GINNY
So why did you come back after all this
time

me what I’ve been doing All he cares
is Im back And Loren just said “You
buy any land out there” and when
said I didn’t he said “Huh too bad”

Rattle of gravel outside as cars drive up Ginny looks out of window sound of
car doors slamming men’s voices Jess stands behind Ginny gently squeezes
the back of her neck

JESS
Its going to be fine

Ginny surprised to feel his hand to hear his words answering her anxious —
hopeful thoughts

Pammy and Linda take around plates of cake to everyone gathered in Daddy’s
living room

Ty and Ginny Rose and Pete Jess Daddy The two witnesses Harold and
Loren MARV CARSON from the bank and their lawyer KEN LA SALLE
Only Caroline is missing

Smiles laughter the words “hog operation” like an incantation
Rose pauses low to Ginny in passing

Ginny in doctors surgery watches

The DOCTOR a cancer specialist testing Rose’s arm for improvement in
strength and movement Rose sits her back to us while he moves her arm
into various positions feeling the muscle strength of pectoral and upper arm

He is pleased with her progress Rose’s X-rays lit on wall behind him

ROSE
I still feel lop-sided

DOCTOR
You will for a while Rose that’s par for
the course

ROSE
Maybe I should have the other one
off for symmetry

Rose stands face to wall stretching her ‘good’ arm up toa marker on the wall
Attempts to reach the same marker with her ‘bad’ arm almost there

DOCTOR
(OS)
Thats very good much better Go to the
top of the class

Rose’s face pleased as she turns

Rose transformed we almost see the strength flowing into her as she and
Ginny walk through the shadowy entrance lobby of the doctor’s old Mason
City building

ROSE
I want to go shopping I want to buy
things I want to do stuff I’ve stopped
myself doing You know Mommy dying

Reflected in the changing-room mirror Rose’s back as she pulls on a top She
turns to the mirror her face changing from anticipation to distress Her hand
flutters up to the missing muscles and breast But she continues to look at
herself taking in the full measure of what she can and can’t do Then she
turns away from the mirror as

Early morning and Ginny is putting in tomato plants a ritualized procedure
She is on her twentieth plant She is showing Jess - hunkered down beside
her in running gear - the method she uses As she spreads sheets of the Des
Moines Register around the tin can protecting the plant

GINNY
- and then the newspaper like this
about four sheets And then grass-
cuttings over that half-decayed is best
just spread like this And that’s it

JESS
You should get Ty to farm like that

JESS
About my motherAll Harold’s told me
is it was cancer But not how it was

how she was Go on planting it’s easier

GINNY
Well Jess all your mother talked about
at the end was you According to Loren
she was convinced that at the last
moment you would come back

JESS
No one told me anything

GINNY
They didn’t know where you were how
could they

Ginny plants but Jess is silent

Then Ginny turns and sees a terrible look on Jesss face of pain and anger She
goes to him as he stands

JESS
Oh Jesus

GINNY
Jess Are you okay

Ginny feels she has never seen such a marvellousiy expressive face She is
drawn intimately into his willingness to reveal his pain and anger to her

JESS

I wrote to her twice in that first year She

knew where I was

Ginny dismayed but wants to defend Jess’s mother

Why keep that from me To punish

And Ginny is shaken and afraid As she tums back to planting and takes out
the next plant her hands are shaking and she snaps the stem in haif

The only constant in the following sequence of ‘good times’ is Ginny’ house
Clothes change as does the time of late day or night and over a couple of
weeks the weather becomes hotter

Rose’s hands made into fists held out knuckles up Jess’s finger taps one fist

Rose’s fist turns and opens out to show held in her palm a little metal

Voices calling cheers barracking as we see a brief moment of the game

Daddy out the back of his house staring up at the distant activity in the field
behind Ginny’s house His burden of resentment grows daily and the shquts
and laughter of the baseball game carrying to him on the still air helps to fuel
it

He moves his head in an odd gesture as if trying to free it from a too-tight
collar As he turns to go back inside

Caroline in the apartment she shares with Frank in Des Moines on the
phone waiting for it to be answered Morning light

Caroline dialling again Listens to ringing No answer Stubborn she waits

Daddy moving away from ringing phone He picks up a farming magazine
and sits in his La-Z-Boy and opens the magazine The phone doesn’t stop

A blazing hot windy day at Pike swimming pool Pool crowded with bodies
including Pammy and Linda in and out of the shallow end

In the crowd around the pool lying and sitting on towels with the hot wind
whipping and flicking at magazines towels hats MARY LIVINGSTONE a
woman in her early seventies has lowered herself down next to Ginny

MARY
How’s your dad Ginny

Ginny feels Mary’s look is unusually piercing

GINNY SO
He’s fine thanks Mary

We might not see you before we go
down to Florida Dad isn’t much for

Ginny halted by Mary’s tone

MARY

Pammy and Linda) age when your mom

She wasn’t afraid for herself She had
true faith She was afraid for you For
the life you would live after she died

Pammy and Linda have come dripping up to Ginny to ask for money for
popsicles Ginny gives it to them and they run off

MARY
She knew what your father was like
even though I think she loved him

A long silence Ginny watches the life of the pool its clarity and ordinariness
as Marys gaze moves across Ginny’s face

Their gazes lock

Ginny disconcerted

MARY
Lord Ginny I shouldn’t have brought
this up But I promised your mom and
then Jimmy had his accident and well I
let it go She wanted you to have more
‘choices

GINNY
I don’t know that I would have had a
different life if mom had lived Daddy
didnt make me marry Ty I wanted to

MARY
There was another thing too -

GINNY
Whats that

MARY
Oh Nothing really

GINNY
Rose went to college She had the
choices Mom wanted and she chose the
farm Caroline chose the ‘city and she’s
been everywhere now New York

squatting under the water Cold water laughter

That night Ginny and Ty getting ready for bed Ty has unrolled the
architectural blueprints for the new farm buildings out on the bed held down
with a couple of magazines As he undresses he leans over them glancing at
the plans as he advises Ginny

TY
You have to handle your father better
Ginny You don’t always have to take
issue You should just let things slide
you and Rose just let them blow over
You don’t give Larry his due

GINNY
You know that’s funny I did this
afternoon After that awful lunch I
don’t know why but I remembered
when was about eight I guess and
Harold hadan accident with his truck
Daddy took me with him and Harold °
was on the ground under the truck The
’ back wheel was on top of him sort of -
“cutting him in half I was frightened I
remember screaming but Daddy didn’t
get angry with me for once He took a
board out of Harold’s truck

A board laid down in oozy mud by a partly-seen young Daddy Ginny eight
is handed a whiskey bottle One foot steps on to the board then the other and
she is making her careful way on the board across the mud to Harold under
the truck We can frighteningly see only Harold’s workboots and legs as if he
has been cut in half

GINNY

(VO cont)
and laid it down He set me on one end
of it and put a whiskey bottle in my
hand and told me to tiptoe over to
Harold and give him something to
drink Daddy and some other farmers
pulled Harold’s truck off him

Ginny in apron runs up the road taking Daddy’s test

out of his window and see me naked

Ginny conscious of her body graceless and hurrying panting ridiculous in its
very femininity

in the vast flatness of the land there are only a few almost imperceptible rises
and falls In one of them a shallow gully in the hot shade of aspens and
honey locusts behind a wild rose thicket is a little dump

auto chassis a few steel drums a bedstead dribs and drabs of discarded
rubbish a truck bed with broken-backed vinyl seat

Ginny transfixed shocked doesn’t step back
All at the same time
Ty puts out a protesting hand to Daddy “Larry” but is batted off

Don’t you make me out to be crazy
I know your game It’s you girls make

get nothing in return just some orders
about doing this and being that and
seeing points of view

As Pete joins the group Rose like a fence-post straight unmoved arms
crossed Her voice as deadly serious as ice-picks

ROSE
We didn’t ask for what you gave us
But maybe it’s high time we got some
reward for what we gave you You say
you know allabout Ginny well Daddy
I know all about you and you know I
know This is what weve got to offer
this same life nothing more nothing
less If you don’t want it go elsewhere
Get someone else to take you in because
I for one have had it

Pete charged up by Rose’s opposition to Daddy Ty torn between his interest
on both sides But neither man tries to stop them there is a field-force
between father and daughters that says “keep out”

Now Daddy looks at Ginny His voice almost conciliatory as if he can divide
and conquer Rose and Ginny

DADDY
You hear her She talks to me almost
worse than you do

GINNY
Daddy if you think this is bad then
youd be amazed at what you really
deserve As far as ’m concerned youre

Rose looks at Ginny perplexed by her unexpected strength then with
vindication

ROSE
Your house is down the road you can
get there I’m going inside

Rose and Ginny turn to hurry inside Pete running up porch steps ahead of
them to open the door urging them into the house But Daddy has moved in
front of his daughters between them and the steps as

DADDY
Don’t think you can treat me like
this I’ll throw you whores off the
place Ill stop this building Ill
get my land back (to Ginny) Youll
never have children you havent
a hope (to Rose) And your children
are going to laugh when you die

From behind Daddy Pete is trying to hustle him away but Daddy just bats
him off Ty protesting “Larry come on that’s enough”

Rose pulls Ginny around Daddy and up the steps and the door slams shut

Ginny and Rose very shaken Ginny looks out of window to see briefly

Ty and Pete trying to urge Daddy into Pete’s truck Daddy batting out at them
Pete gives up hurrying towards house as

ROSE

across to glove-compartment and takes out a full quarter-pint of whiskey As
he unscrews the cap

Rose looks at Ginny as if from a long distance

ROSE
I thought you knew I thought all these
years you and shared this knowledge
sort of underneath everything else I
thought that if after that you could go

you do then it was okay to just put it
behind us

GINNY

ROSE
I’m not sure I mean he told me that if I
went along with him he wouldn’t get
interested in her I was afraid hed try
something with her and she was eight

he’d picked me me to be his favourite
not you not her I thought it was okay
that it must be okay if he said it was

He looks from Ginny to Rose

Fields of tall corn almost ready for harvesting Late afternoon light fills it

Jess appears running on road through corn sweating feet pounding

On another part of the road Pete drives his silver truck

Jess and Pete pass each other both give a wave

Pete watches in his rear-view mirror Jess disappearing away from him

He takes a swig from a quarter-pint of whiskey held between his legs He is
very drunk but we don’t realise how drunk

He sings on and off very sweet He reaches over to glove-compartment

The truck swerves on the road

The quarry in the time just before dusk the light fading and cooling Silence

filled with small sounds Tall dense growth of weeds and wild plants
Birdweed coils through everything

Shadows move across the deep water

Faint sound of a truck growing louder
Birds fly up wheel around

Pete’s silver truck appears driving too fast flattening plants in its path and
instead of stopping before the quarry’s edge it keeps straight on

Pete in the truck the ride of his life Too late to turn back he gives a giant
bellowing roar of fear and astonishment

The truck sails into the quarry where it sinks quite easily

Early morning about six Ginny carrying out blankets to air on the line

Later the Judge is summing up

JUDGE

the arguments are fairly clear and the
plaintiffs have failed to establish either
abuse of the property or

mismanagement of its assets The fact is
in this state if you legally sign over your
property it is very hard to change your
mind and get it back

A long pause

Obviously the mental condition of
the chief plaintiff Mr Cook must

also come under consideration Were
the property to revert to him it’s not
clear given the deep divisions in the
family who would farm it But this

is only a corollary consideration The
law is clear I find in favour of the
defendants Mrs Lewis Mrs Smith and
Mr Smith

Everyone starts to shift but the Judge has not finished

A busy restaurant with its continual noise After a while we see that Ginny is

Rose takes some deep breaths drinks a little water through a straw

At the peak of the harvest I drove fifteen
truckloads a day to the elevator We got

Pammy and Linda - more than a year older since we last saw them - opening
the door to Ginny The three hug their arms around each other their heads
together

Although Daddy’s kitchen is now Rose’s it is essentially the same Linda and
Pammy hang around while Ginny unwraps chicken pieces she has bought
Ginny is freezing The kitchen seems cold and underlit
