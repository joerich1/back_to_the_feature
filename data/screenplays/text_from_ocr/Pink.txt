Inside however Deepak feels uneasy as he is here after a
long time - having been in and around for years earlier and
the girls because they are here for the first time

Minals parents are extremely uneasy as if they are the
detainees

A lost looking Deepak doesnt inspire any confidence either

OMKAR
Aap - aapki taiyyari achhi hai

He doesnt really know what to ask and Deepak doesnt really
know what to say

Deepak is drawn to the floor The cement is cracked and worn
off in places He avoids it as he goes towards a table and
chair in the front but he keeps on getting distracted by the
floor - the cracks in the floor

There is a sudden flurry and murmuring inside as well as in
the corridors of the small sessions court Prashant Sir

Mehta Ji These are the whispers you can hear and then

we see the renowned Public Prosecutor PRASHANT MEHTA almost
storm in

Once inside Prashant straight away lowers his specs from his
head onto his nose and begins to read the case file

Then he senses something Finds Deepak look at him almost
smiling Prashant Mehta returns the smile It is clear that

they have known each other before and been in such battles
before

mahilayein inhi laws ka faayda
uthakar shareef aur innocent logon

koshish kar rahin hain Iss case

February ko ek rock show mein Minal
Arora ne Rajvir Singh aur uske
saathiyun ke saath dosti ki Rajvir
aur uske friends ne inn ladikyun ko
RS Resort mein dinner ke liye
invite kiya toh Minal Arora aur
uski saathioyun ne paise ke badle
mein inke saath sexual relations
establish karne ki offer di - iss
baat se Rajvir ghabra gaya usne

aise dene se inkaar kar diya toh
inhoney unke saath jhagda kiya -
usey rape case mein phansaane ki
dhamki di - Lekin jab Rajvir ne is
sab ke baad bhi paise dene ko mana
kiya toh uspe hamla kar diya

attack was unprovoked and vicious
Uske turant baad yeh ladki baaqi

Kisi ko private mein joke sunana

PRASHANT MEHTA
That is exactly my point your
honour Jab ek ladki publicly aisa
joke tak nahi suna sakti toh
publicly maanegi kaise ki voh wahan
solicit kar rahi thi - Naturally
voh yehi kahegi ki simple dinner
and drinks ke liye saath gayi thi -
Lekin court ko samajhaana chahiye
ki voh unke saath gayi jo almost
uske liye strangers hain - So we
can not depend on her statement We
have to depend on other witnesses
and the video evidence which we
want to play in front of the court
We will prove ki inhoney paise
Maange

Minal looks lost as her mother comes in Mother looks
worried She takes her hands in her hands

MOTHER
Minu tu tu tu kuchh aisa
vaisa mat karnatu

MINAL
Utni kamzor nahi hoon main Maam -

JUDGE
Where are we going with this

DEEPAK
You promised to answer I just want
an answer

MINAL
Nahi hum ek doosre ko pasand kartey
thhey - we were attracted to each
other - so pay karney ka sawaal hi
kahan aata hai

DEEPAK
Toh usne aapko pay nahi kiya - He
didnt pay you - did he force you

MINAL
(getting pushed a bit
now)
Nahi usne force bhi nahi kiya - pay
bhi nahi kiya - we liked each other
- we did it because we both wanted
to

DEEPAK
Iske baad jaise ki aapko jaanne
wale uss ladke Vishwa ne police ko
bayan diya hai - aapke kayi
relationships hue Kya aapke
lagbhag sabke saath sexual
relations rahey

MINAL
Haan kabhie kabhie magar-

DEEPAK
Toh hue and youve just admitted to
that Toh phir uss din ek

February ko jab aap Rajvir ke saath
thein toh aisa kya ho gaya tha - I
mean ek aur se kya farg padhta tha

FOR DUBBING

MINAL
What Kya matlab hai iss ka

DEEPAK
Matlab yeh ki 1st february ki raat
ko Rajvir aur uske saathiyun ne bhi
yehi socha hoga na ki yeh ek fairly
promiscous ladki hai - ek aur se
kya farq padega - I understand unki
itni maturity nahi hai ki voh yeh
soch sakein ki issey pehle aisa jab
bhi hua aapki marzi se Bina paise
liye - bina kisi dabaav ke hua -
But since you were a woman of
questionable character in the minds
of the accused - Rajvir and his
friends - aapne kya clear
indication diya iss ladke ko ki -
main iss waqt sex mein interested
nahi hoon

MINAL
Pehle maine mana kiya

DEEPAK
Kya kaha ya kiya

MINAL
Maine push kiya usko resist kiya
- Bola dont do it

DEEPAK
So mana kiya aapne
MINAL
Yeah I said NO
DEEPAK
WHAT
MINAL

NO - I SAID NO

DEEPAK
Kya Kya kaha aapne

MINAL
NO I said NO

DEEPAK
No She said NO your honour No
Uske bavajood Rajvir Singh ne inko
inappropriately chhuva - bahut
gande tareekey se - she felt
humiliated - yeh thoda nashe mein
thin - aur nashe se mujhe rule no 4

FOR DUBBING

yaad aaya - kisi ladke ke saath
baithke aapko sharaab peena nahi
chahiye - Kyunki unhey lagta hai ki
aisa karne wali ladki unhey khuli
chhot degi - that is she easy
Excuse my choice of words but ladkon ko
lagta hai ki saath mein baith ke peeni
wali ladki saath mein sone se bhi nahi
katraayegi

Yahan peena health hazard nahi
kharaab character ki nishaani maana
jaata hai ladkiyun ke liye lekin
ladkon pe yeh apply nahi hota Unke
liye sirf health hazard Terms and
conditions vary your honour
(sarcastically)
Aur bhi rules hain - Rule no 5 -
jeans t shirt skirt etc etc
ladkiyun ko bilkul nahi pehanna
chahiye kyunki issey inka toh kuchh
nahi bigadta lekin ladkon ko khatra
ho jaata hai - bechare ladkey issey
uttejit hoke bina koi galti hotey
hue bhi galti karkey phans saktey
hain Rule no 6 - jaisa ki haal hi
mein kisi ne kaha hai - ladkiyun ko
har ladke ko Bhaiyya bulana chahiye
- Bhaiyya bulayengey toh ladkon ko
koi galatfahmi nahi hogi - ladke
safe raheingey - kuchh galat nahi
samjheingey - kuchh galat nahi
kareingey - aaj tak hum galat
direction mein effort kartey rahein
hain your honour - it is our boys
that we must keep safe not our
girls - if we keep our boys safe
the girls will automatically be
safe Isliye Rule no - 7 - chowmein
ban kar dena chahiye - Ladkun ko
chowmein bilkul na khaane diya
jaaye yehi unse galti karvaata hai
aur agar bechare galti se kha bhi
lein - toh kisi chowmein khaane
wale ladke ke paas ladkiyan ko nahi
jaana chahiye - aur agar gayin toh
phir kanoon ki koi zimmedari nahi
honi chahiye - Rule no 8 - jo
accused Rajvir Singh ka hi suggest
kiya hua hai isliye yeh bahut
important rule hai - hans hans ke
baat nahi karni hai kisi bhi ladke
se - voh galat samajh sakta hai -
khushi ki baat bhi chehre pe
seriousness rakhtey hue batani
chahiye ladkiyun ko Rule no 9 -
Koi ladki shehar mein alag ya akele
nahi rahegi - aisa sirf ladke kar

FOR DUBBING

saktey hain - ladkiyan independent
hoke ladkon ko confuse na karein -
Rule no 10 - 11 - 12 - ladkiyun ko
mobile mat dijiye zyada mat
padhaiyye jaldi shaadi kar dijiye
etc etc etc But I am digressing
Meri client ne khali Rule no 4 toda
- thodi pi rakhi thi jiski sazza
hai nahi kanoon mein par aap de
saktey hain - Since she had a few
drinks perhaps that caused the
intensity of her action - and that
is how it happenedBaar baar chhue
jaane pe ek ladki ki pratikriya thi
self defence mein uthaya hua ek
kadam - causing grievous injury ya
attempt to murder nahi

PRASHANT MEHTA

JUDGE
Closing Arguments for all the cases
please

Prashant Mehta gets up

PRASHANT MEHTA
Maine court ke saamne prove kiya
hai your honour ki yeh teenon
ladkiyan wahan prostitution ke
intent se gayin aur incident ke
baad bhaag gayin Aur itne din tak
chup rahin agar galti nahi hoti
toh incident ke itne din baad tak
yeh police se bhaagtin nahi balki
khud chalke police ke paas jaatin
Jo ki mere client ne kiya Agar
uske dil mein chor hota toh voh
khud inke against FIR karke baat
kyun khulvaata After all Rajvir
Singh ek reputable family se hai -
young hai - uske saamne uska poora
future hai - Maine aapke saamne
doctor ki report pesh ki jismein
saaf kaha gaya hai ki humla jaan
leva tha Investigative officer ne
bhi saaf kaha hai ki ladkiyun ke
bayan mein koi dum nahi hai Waiter
aur Manager ne inke khilaaf witness
di Circumstantial video evidence
saunpi gayi court ko Attack mein
jo weapon use hua voh bhi barmad
hua uspe Minal Arora ke ungliyun
ke nishaan hain aur doosre case
mein aapke paas Falak Ali ka
admission hai usne na bola kisi ne
suna nahi - na hum maujood di -
Consent ka koi issue hi involved
nahi tha - yeh toh sirf defence ka
ek hathkanda hai kyunki aajkal
consent debate ki thodi hawa hai
inhoney court mein bina basis ke
vohi debate utaar di Inke pehle

FOR DUBBING

case ki tarah hi inke doosra cases
bhi farzi hain isliye usmein
phansaye hue sabhie innocent ladkun
ko baizzat bari kiya jaaye Attempt
to murder ke under main Minal Arora
ke liye kum se kum dus saal ki
sazza ki demand karta hoon aur baqi
donon ladkiyun ko sabak sikhaney ke
liye unhey khaali fine karke na
chhoda jaaye - unko bhi chhey
mahine ki saza sunayi jaaye taki
voh aage aisi harkatun se baaz
aayein That is all

JUDGE
Deepak Ji any closing arguement

76B INT COURTROOM DAY9

DEEPAK

(gets up)
No

Everybody reacts The judge lightly uses the hammer to
silence the crowd

But he does not sit It is quiet in the court now

DEEPAK (CONTD)
Aur Na sirf ek shabd nahi apne aap
mein ek poora vakya hai Isey kisi
tarah ke tark spashtikaran ya
vyakhya ki zaroorat nahi hoti aur
na ka matlab na hi hota hai She
said NO She clearly said NO and we
must make that NO count make that
NO echo - so that boys like him
realise that NO means NO chahe
voh bolne wali ladki aapki koi
parichit ho friend ho girlfriend
ho koi prostitute ho ya aapki apni
biwi
(pained angered almost
frustrated)
Yes No means No and it is time to
stop when somebody says so

The Judge looks long and hard at Deepak

We can see the Judge has now completely moved onto the
girls side

JUDGE (VO)
The court believes that a beginning has been made in this
case Although Minal Arora ke khilaaf 307 ke case mein gawah bhi
thhey aur evidence bhi - voh court ke saamne un circumstances ko clear
kar paayin jinki vajah se yeh haadsa hua - The court finds that
there was grave provocation aur unke khilaaf 307 ke under jo charge
tha usko dismiss karti hai Section 320 324 ke under Minal Arora
Falak Ali aur Andrea Taraing ke khilaaf jo bhi charges hain voh
nature mein motivated aur vindictive paaye gaye hain Ismein
unke khilaaf koi solid evidence nahi hai The court finds Rajvir
