INT HOLLOW TREE TRUNK - DAY

SUPER
Manhattan - Winter of 1563

A warm beam of morning light spills into the hollow opening
of a tree trunk The damp interior brightens In its center
is a nest made of leaves and branches Suddenly we hear the
FAINT SOUND of a BOY’S VOICE calling out in American Indian
dialect

A BABY SQUIRREL’S HEAD POPS UP from the nest It hops over
its siblings and runs out

EXT TRUNK ENTRANCE - TREE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The Baby Squirrel clumsily runs down the tree and stops a few
feet from the ground The forest floor is covered with a
fresh blanket of snow

A YOUNG AMERICAN-INDIAN BOY in native attire is kneeling by
the tree He’s holding an acorn Behind the Boy is his
FATHER

INDIAN FATHER
Be gentle to our Man-Hat-Tan our good-
land my son and all its creatures will
accept you

The Boy lowers his hand to the ground The Baby Squirrel
approaches As it grabs the acorn a GUN SHOT resonates
throughout the land The three of them are startled

We PULL BACK as the Baby Squirrel races up the tree and the
Boy runs to his Father We continue to PULL BACK until we
see an extreme wide view of the island In the distance a
European boat approaches the shoreline of Manhattan

Suddenly the effect of TIME-LAPSE ANIMATION transforms the
rolling hills and vast forest into the modern city of
MANHATTAN NEW YORK

Immediately after the instant evolution of New York City we
SINK BACK DOWN to the SAME TREE Today it’s in the dead
center of a small run down park surrounded by skyscrapers
Across the street is the famous Flatiron Building
INT HOLLOW TREE TRUNK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

SUPER
Manhattan - Winter today

A young squirrel named MAN-HAT-TAN MANNY for short sleeps
in a nest made of old newspapers and fast food wrappers He
has a streak of grey fur on his bushy tail He awakes and
walks to the entrance

MANNY’S POV - MADISON PARK

One sad portrait The park is covered with filthy snow
There’s only a handful of trees Vagrants sleep on the
benches Worst of all it’s enclosed by pillars of concrete

TREE

Manny looks around calmly Suddenly he notices a small
chocolate-colored squirrel climbing up his tree It’s DREAM-
BIRD a young female Manny looks at her with anger

MANNY
Dream-Bird there’s nothing to eat in my
tree so scram --

DREAM-BIRD
Relax Manny I wasn’t trying to steal
your food Besides your tree looks like
it’11 crumble at next snow fall anyway

The ancient tree looks like it could simply fall to pieces
with a strong gust of wind It’s checkered with wide cracks
exposing the interior to yet another cold winter

MANNY
Why are you here

DREAM-BIRD
Oh never mind I forgot how grumpy you
are in the morning If you’d rather be
alone suit yourself squirrel But these
winter days are much colder that way

MANNY
Hey Wait --

She jumps from Manny’s tree and SOARS to an adjacent tree
MANNY (cont’ d)
(screaming)
You’ re gonna break your neck if you keep
on acting like a bird

DREAM-BIRD
(vanishing up the tree)
Why would you care

MANNY
Once crazy always crazy

Manny returns to his daily scout of the dismal park
With surprise and great excitement he spots an ACORN

MANNY (cont’d)
Oh you’re mine

He heads down the tree Old wet bark falls to the ground
with Manny’s quick descent

A few feet from the ground he lunges toward the acorn
letting out a LOUD INDIAN WAR CRY Before he can grab the
nut a PIGEON dives from the overcast sky and snatches it out
from underneath him Manny falls head first into the snow

MANNY (cont’d)
(muffled)
You dirty hard nose I’11 --

PIGEON
You’11 just have to look for another one
furry rat

MANNY
(to himself)
They’ re gonna starve us to death

Manny notices something out of the corner of his eye He
turns his head in disbelief A magnificent loaf of shiny
golden-brown BREAD is planted in the snow

His face turns to an expression of utter joy

MANNY (cont’d)
This may be a good day after all
DOG PARK ENCLOSURE

The loaf of bread sits in the snow just beyond a green metal
fence A sign on the fence reads “DOG PARK ENCLOSURE”
Stretching out from the center of the dog park is a single
OLD TREE TRUNK - a lonely column of nature DOGS are playing
madly in the snow

MANNY
sneaks over to the loaf of bread
MANNY

You long-teeth are going to regret
leaving food unattended

He squeezes under the fence

INT DOG PARK ENCLOSURE - MADISON PARK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The dogs are too busy chasing each other to notice the
invader

Manny is a few inches from the bread He raises his butt in
the air preparing for his pounce attack

MANNY
Quick as lightning

He jumps claws and mouth open and lands on the bread He
bites into the loaf It makes a LOUD SQUEAK

All of the dogs freeze in their tracks and look at him
There’s a moment of stillness between them

Manny lets go of the dog-chew-toy It SQUEAKS again with the
release of his bite

All the dogs leap toward Manny BARKING like mad beasts

ALL THE DOGS
Eat the rat

MANNY
Eat the rat
(beat)
Oh no
Manny SPRINGS OVER the fence with one jump and lands neck
deep in snow

EXT DOG PARK ENCLOSURE - MADISON PARK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

A BABY GERMAN SHEPHERD hurdles the fence and lands right on
top of him pushing him deeper into the snow The Shepherd
furiously sniffs through the snow

In the BG Manny’s head pops out of another snow pile He
spits some dirty snow out of his mouth

The small Shepherd spots him and leaps forward - jaws open

Manny breaks free of the snow and runs for his life He hops
to a tree and races up it

EXT TREE - MADISON PARK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

High above Manny caught on a branch is a PLASTIC BAG It
flaps in the wind Still racing up the tree he looks down
at the Shepherd

MANNY
Can’t climb huh Ha ha

As Manny turns back he runs straight into the bag A gust
of wind WRAPS the bag around Manny’s body - totally trapping
him inside In a desperate effort to escape he runs blindly
up the tree He bumps his head into a branch Losing his
grip he tumbles backward CRACKING branches on the way down

EXT TRASH CAN - MADISON PARK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Sitting on the rim of the trash can is TRASHIE a scrawny
looking squirrel His fur is covered with some kind of
sticky filth He’s holding a rotten carrot with his claw
He eyes it like a keen produce merchant

Enveloped in the plastic bag Manny falls straight into the
trash can startling Trashie

TRASHIE
Joy A gift -- from above

With his beady eyes Trashie searches the can MOANS of
discomfort come from inside the plastic bag Manny’s small
head emerges from a rip in the bag He looks disoriented
MANNY
Where am I

TRASHIE
Joy A friend from elsewhere You’re
from outside yes Saw you land great
aim
(taps his head with the carrot)
Mental note trash cans are good for high
falls

Suddenly a GARBAGE MAN approaches and grabs the can

TRASHIE
jumps off but pursues the man toward a garbage truck

TRASHIE
Bring him back rock-dweller He’s from
outside He’s come to get me

THE GARBAGE MAN
empties the can into the back of the truck

GARBAGE MAN
(screaming overly loud)
Okay Frankie go ahead

INT COMPACTOR - GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Manny frees himself of the bag and shuffles between piles of
junk Above is the opening of the truck’s compactor
Suddenly a LOUD MECHANICAL NOISE fills the compactor The
walls start closing in - CRUSHING EVERYTHING The opening
closes

A boom-box EXPLODES Taken by panic Manny hops across heaps
of garbage as they tumble toward him He reaches the
shrinking opening but slips on a greasy hamburger wrapper
and falls into a Tupperware container full of green jello
He’s immediately encased in the green slop Stuck he’s
ready to except his pathetic fate

The pressure of compacting trash builds until it squeezes the
Tupperware and FIRES MANNY OUT LIKE A CANNONBALL

He soars right through the closing compactor walls They
slam shut on his exit
MANNY

flies through the air caked in rotting green jello

INT NYC YELLOW CAB - DAY - CONTINUOUS

A CAB DRIVER is humming “NEW YORK NEW YORK” when Manny
crashes onto his windshield - SPLATTERING green jello
everywhere He slams on the brakes sending Manny back into
the air

The Cab Driver eyes the green sludge left by Manny and hits
the wipers

CAB DRIVER
I love this city

EXT NYC STREET - DAY -— CONTINUOUS

Manny FLIES INTO FRAME and smacks into a stop sign He
slides off it and lands inside Madison Park again - his fall
cushioned by a blanket of slush

EXT DOG ENCLOSURE - MADISON PARK - DAY - CONTINUOUS
He gets up shaking his wet tail

MANNY
Please make it stop

He looks up Manny is in utter shock - he’s in the middle of
the dog enclosure A gigantic DOBERMAN stands over him
sniffing the jello Then the Doberman takes a couple quick
licks

Manny is not covered in jello anymore but rather wads of
canine saliva Fed up he grabs the Doberman’s snout and
bites down

The Doberman BARKS in pain and frantically whips his head
But Manny holds on The Doberman runs toward the lonely old
tree of the dog park

The Doberman crashes into the trunk Manny leaps off and
grabs the bark of the tree
MANNY (cont’d)
That will teach you to mess with smaller
ones

Mad as hell the Doberman jumps - his bite misses Manny by a
hair Manny makes a run for the top of the tree

EXT TOP OF OLD TREE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Reaching the top Manny realizes too late that the tree trunk
is hollow HE FALLS INSIDE

INT HOLLOW TREE TRUNK - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Manny lands on a surface made of soft leaves Curious beams
of light from the entire spectrum come from below him
Dazed he works his way down the inner wall of the trunk

He reaches a hollow space - the tree trunk’s base or foyer
depending on how you look at it Scattered about the walls
are small pieces of stained glass from broken bottles
Beautiful rays of colorful light illuminate the interior

MANNY
(pinching his nose)
Pee-U This place stinks

VOICE (0OS)
It keeps the long-teeth from finding me
They think they’ re marking they’re
territory --

MANNY
Stay away from me I will fight You
understand

An age-old squirrel OLD SQUEAKY limps from out of a Coke
can The can has a door-like opening chewed into its side

OLD SQUEAKY
(pinching his ear)
You better squeak louder young one The
bark of the long-teeth have taken a toll
on my hearing

MANNY
You’re just old I’m sorry I’ve had
a bad day
OLD SQUEAKY
Don’t worry I’m a friend

MANNY
(inching closer)
Hey I’ve never seen you before

OLD SQUEAKY

The way those long-teeth were after you
Id say you were about to see your

ancestors

MANNY

I thought I knew all of us -- in the
world How come I don’t know you

Old Squeaky enters a blue beam of light

OLD SQUEAKY

There’s a reason for that None of you
ever come near this tree You fear the
long-teeth I like it that way alone

MANNY
But what family are you from

OLD SQUEAKY

Listen -- you don’t know me because I

wasn’t born here
(beat)

I was born outside your good-land

MANNY

No you weren’t This is the last land in
the world How could you be born beyond
It’s only cold rock-dweller rock out

there

OLD SQUEAKY

It wasn’t always so You and your
fellow squirrels here in this particular
good-land are not the last of our kind
There are more of us -- many more

MANNY
But who could live in the rock
home only to the rock-dwellers

for a squirrel Their hard land hurts
our feet their white fire hurts our eyes

and their living hurts our ears
OLD SQUEAKY
Sit and listen young one you’re
stubborn but if I don’t tell you now I
might never tell anyone
(inching closer)
There’s more to the world than you can
imagine

I was born in a good-land far beyond
yours

My sweet little acorn just beyond the
river of death there’s nothing but cold
rock We must be grateful for what we
have here

BABY SQUEAKY
There’s no others outside

MOTHER
Only in young squirrels’ dreams

We PULL BACK to reveal all of CENTRAL PARK including its
giant reservoir and the river of death - the car covered
streets that rip through the park

OLD SQUEAKY (VO)

The land we lived on was vast much
bigger than this one There was a giant
sea a river trees taller than the rock-
dwellers’ mountains

(with joy and sadness)
-- and so many of us that you could
never know them all -- you would never
fall short of friends

listen

CUT TO

EXT STREET - CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Baby Squeaky is standing on the stone ledge of an overpass-
bridge that cuts through Central Park He watches with great
curiosity at the RACING OBJECTS below

OLD SQUEAKY (VO)
One day when I was the size of a pine
cone I was curious about the river of
death I decided to test my courage

Baby Squeaky inches closer to the edge

OLD SQUEAKY (V0O) (cont’d)
I’ve never been so afraid The long-
teeth are nothing compared to
(beat)
That’s when I lost my footing
(deep breath)
The noise was maddening

We hear the SOUND of a CAR HORN

BABY SQUEAKY
FALLS from the bridge and onto the top of a passing car

OLD SQUEAKY (VO)
I held on

Velocity beats down on Baby Squeaky as he grasps the car’s
bowed antenna
OLD SQUEAKY (V0O) (cont’d)
Are you sure you want to hear this

MANNY (VO)
Please don’t stop

INT HOLLOW TREE TRUNK - SQUEAKY’S TREE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Old Squeaky lowers his head in a tired hopeless manner

OLD SQUEAKY

Truth or lie it doesn’t matter anymore I
just want to picture a better world than
this one --

OLD SQUEAKY
There might still be hope for you

INT NYC UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT
Wrapped around the car’s antenna Baby Squeaky is out cold

KAREN STOCKWELL a cute precocious girl in her early teens
steps out of the car She immediately notices Baby Squeaky
and gently pries him free of the antenna

The driver emerges Karen’s mother MRS STOCKWELL She sees
her daughter with a squirrel and is immediately repulsed by
the windblown rodent

OLD SQUEAKY (VO)
When I came to my senses I was in the

most comfortable nest I’ve ever had
White as snow soft as my mother’s coat

INT LIVING ROOM - NYC BROWNSTONE - NIGHT - LATER

Baby Squeaky sticks his head out of a shoe box that’s lined
with cotton

Karen brings a spoon of warm milk to his mouth

took care of me It gave me food that
filled my mouth with sensations I had
never experienced before

me a name One of their names It
called me “Squeaky”

INT HOLLOW TREE TRUNK - SQUEAKY’S TREE - DAY
Old Squeaky is moved with feelings of sadness and nostalgia

MANNY
That’s how you came here

OLD SQUEAKY
Yes That was many snows ago

MANNY
If this is true -- why didn’t you try to
go back

OLD SQUEAKY
What lies between these two worlds is
not for any squirrel to see It’s an
impossible journey into a Universe where
fire burns in rock day and night Where
there’s no help on the way

MANNY
(scared)
I’m not afraid I would rather die than
stay here --

OLD SQUEAKY
But is my story true It’s been so
long
(beat)
Sometimes I wonder if it happened at all
if it wasn’t for this

Old Squeaky lifts up the fur around his neck Manny moves
closer A thin worn out red collar is fastened around Old
Squeaky’s neck Hanging from the collar is a gold bell On
the collar is a small gold tag in the shape of a heart
ENGRAVED on the tag is the name “SQUEAKY”

Manny slumps back into a pile of leaves Convinced

OLD SQUEAKY (cont’d)
Yes Just like the ones the long-teeth
wear

MANNY
It’s true

OLD SQUEAKY
Believe it young one There is hope
but only if you believe

The blue light turns to shadow Both of them turn around

A dog snout PUSHES IN on one of the many walls of stained
glass

MANNY
They must have smelled me

The dog BARKS and CLAWS at the opening Splinters of bark
fly everywhere

MANNY (cont’d)
Let’s get out of here

OLD SQUEAKY
No You go This is the way it was
meant to be

The dog manages to force his snout into the hollow trunk

MANNY
You’re crazy They’1l eat you

Old Squeaky quickly takes off his collar and slips it over
Manny’s head

MANNY (cont’d)
Why No

OLD SQUEAKY
Keep it A reminder that there’s another
good-land out there

Old Squeaky pushes Manny into the chewed-out doorway of the
plastic bottle

OLD SQUEAKY (cont’d)

It’s called The Park It is where I came

from and where you must go
The dog a ROTTWEILER BREAKS THROUGH
Old Squeaky leaps onto a bicycle handle which SPRINGS DOWN
Rigged like a pulley the bottle LIFTS OFF the ground like a
rocket pulled by an old retractable dog leash
MANNY

CRIES OUT as the rig shoots him straight up and through the
tree trunk

Jimmied like a catapult the bottle arrives at the top of the

lands perfectly into an adjacent tree outside the dog park

INT TREE TOP - DAY - CONTINUOUS

A tall heap of leaves had been placed to cushion the landing
Manny gets up and rushes to the edge

walks away from Squeaky’s tree - waging his tail with joy
In his mouth is Old Squeaky’s bushy tail

Manny wanders about in the snow He stops and looks out at
the racing traffic In his little paw he grabs the bell of
his new collar Suddenly Trashie appears from out of the
snow

TRASHIE
You’re back my friend Here a gift

Trashie places his entire paw deep into his mouth and
searches for something in his storage cavity He looks
perplexed for a second Then he pulls out a slimy MandM minus
most of its shell and hands it to Manny

MANNY

(ignoring the candy)
You’re that crazy one I heard about
Living in rock-dweller garbage right
Did your parents abandon you or
something

(beat)
I’m sorry but I don’t know you We were
never friends --

TRASHIE
No of course not you’re from up I saw

Trashie pulls Manny inside

immediately start asking Trashie a million questions

Can you help me with my tail again --

All the rats start to whisper the two words “The Park”

An old female rat BIG BELLE pushes through the crowd of
rats and comes face to face with Manny

BIG BELLE
Stranger You better not be fibbing to
our Trashie

MANNY
I don’t understand

BIG BELLE
No matter how sad we are to see our

Overwhelmed Manny sags placing his head in his paws

MANNY
This is too much for one day
BIG BELLE
If you come from the outside you’1l
bring him back

Manny looks around at all the rats and Trashie

looks like he could cry He looks up and into Manny’s eyes
with hope

Manny puts a paw on Trashie’s shoulder

The troop of rats release a LOUD CHEER Trashie hugs Manny

remember where it is

With a mixture of surprise and disappointment all the rats
look at Manny

EXT LAWN - MADISON PARK - DAY - LATER
Manny follows Trashie to the dog park enclosure

MANNY
Are you positive the long-teeth know
where The Park is

TRASHIE
That’s all they bark about It’s funny

recognize this

TRASHIE
It’s their master They call it catch
They’11 follow if they see it Go now
Ask where The Park is

Manny walks along the wire Twenty feet below are a DOZEN
DOGS running after each other and destroying chew toys

Reaching the center of the dog enclosure he grabs the ball
in his claws and looks down

to tell me where The Park is

DOG 123
(all together)
The Park -- Sunday -- treats

MANNY
(losing his patience)
Where is it you bunch of mad --

Manny slips and lets go of the ball He snags the cable with
his hind legs and CATCHES the ball in his paws

The dogs’ excitement multiplies A small CHIHUAHUA jumps
onto a LAB’S head

Their HUMAN MASTERS try to pull the dogs apart - from what’s
becoming a mountain of hyper dogs

DOG 1234

(shouting)
Give -- throw -- now
MANNY
Where is -- The Park

The dogs are going crazy climbing over each other

Manny’s right hind leg GIVES WAY - now dangling from the
stretched cable with only his left hind leg

The Paaarkk Where

Manny’s left hind leg GIVES WAY He falls

At that same instant below the small Chihuahua climbs up
the back of a BOXER and jumps straight up with extraordinary
speed and strength Manny and the Chihuahua float toward
each other in SLOW-MOTION As they’re about to meet the
Chihuahua BARKS OUT

CHIHUAHUA
Up Town

The small Chihuahua reaches Manny and BITES DOWN on the
tennis ball Manny retains a slipping grip on the green
ball The two of them are suspended in mid-air Manny looks
at the Chihuahua straight in the eye

MANNY
Thank You

They fall into the dead center of the dog huddle and vanish
from sight Then like a bullet the Chihuahua LEAPS out
from under the Boxer and sprints across the lawn with the
ball in his jaws

Manny is dragged underneath the Chihuahua like a rag doll as
he keeps his grip on the ball A dozen frenzied dogs are in
hot pursuit Without warning the Chihuahua leaps
magnificently through the air toward his master’s arms

In mid-air Manny exhausted lets go and lands outside the
dog enclosure - crashing into the snow again

DREAM-BIRD
Tell me

MANNY
Well
(eyeing her with conviction)
There’s another good-land a magnificent
vast land with rivers trees food

DREAM-BIRD
You’re crazy This is the good-land
silly there’s nothing out there but
rock

MANNY
Dream-Bird just listen to me for a
second I’ve had the strangest day
Look here

From under his fur Manny reveals Old Squeaky’s collar to
Dream-Bird Her eyes go wide with shock

DREAM-BIRD
You have to stop hanging with those long-
teeth

MANNY

I didn’t get this from one of them I

got it from a squirrel
We PULL BACK from Dream-Bird’s POV of the heart shaped tag as
Manny continues to tell her about his day
EXT DREAM-BIRD’S NEST - DUSK
We continue to PULL BACK and UP INTO THE SKY The POV is a
reveal of Manhattan and in its center just two miles uptown
is Central Park - a mere twelve dollar cab ride for a rock-

dweller but a pilgrimage for a squirrel

DISSOLVE TO

INT DREAM-BIRD’S NEST - NIGHT

Dream-Bird’s eyes are wide with amazement Then they
suddenly turn to disbelief

DREAM-BIRD
So what did the long-teeth tell you

MANNY
Just two words up and town

Her eyes suddenly widen again She hops up and rushes
outside

MANNY (cont’d)
Hey What’s going on
EXT DREAM-BIRD’S NEST - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Dream-Bird gazes out at the gray skyscrapers surrounding
their meager plot Her eyes fill with tears

Manny steps outside and goes to her

MANNY
What’s wrong
DREAM-BIRD
It’s up That’s where it is -- up

In a flash she turns around and grabs Manny by the shoulders

DREAM-BIRD (cont’ d)

(staring at the skyscrapers)
Ever since I was a child I dreamed of
flying over those towers of rock
Something in the wind told me the answers
was up

(she locks eyes with Manny)
I’m coming with you but first we tell
the others

MANNY
(doubtful)
Okay
(with a heavy sigh)
Let’s do it now then

EXT LAWN - MADISON PARK - NIGHT - LATER

TWO DOZEN SQUIRRELS have created a semi-circle in the middle
of the snow-covered lawn of Madison Park Manny stands on
top of a wooden sign Trashie and Dream-Bird are by his
side The wind is blowing hard Snow flakes are falling

ELDER SQUIRREL
It’s cold out here so hurry up before
we all freeze Manny

SQUIRREL 1
Yeah what’s so important Are they
taking down another tree

SQUIRREL 2
(shaking uncontrollably)
Not another hole in the long-teeth fence

SQUIRREL 3
Or are you gonna tell us why you tried to
play with them today

Squirrel 1 laughs The others follow along creating a
chorus of giggles

DREAM-BIRD
Quiet This is a matter of life or
death Tell them Manny

SQUIRREL 1
Yeah spit it out or we’1l all die of
frostbite
The chorus of laughter simmers down Manny freezes with
doubt Dream-Bird notices She looks him in the eyes with
belief and support

DREAM-BIRD
Tell them

MANNY
(with renewed confidence)

Dream-Bird’s right All of you know life
is getting harder around here Our good-
land shrinks everyday the rock-dwellers
take another one of our trees away This
time it was mine next time it will be
yours There’s less food Less grass
If this goes on much longer the good-
land will disappear And us with it

ELDER SQUIRREL
Nonsense The good-land has resisted the

rock for ages It will keep on living
It’s the very last land and we’re here to
guard it

It starts snowing harder

MANNY
You’re wrong There’s others like us out
there living in peace with no fear and
plenty of space

SQUIRREL 2
Alright you’re another one of those
freaks believing in little green lands
far away I’ve heard enough Soon
you’1l be living with the rock-dwellers
and long-teeth speaking in bark-tong

Mocking Manny all the squirrels breakout into a ensemble of
squeaky barks which quickly turns into another chorus of
laughter

SQUIRREL 1
You’11 never change always trying to
show off with your crazy stories
(thinking back)
Like that time you tried to make a warmer
nest from those silver leaves

A dirty ball of foil paper is tossed at him He dodges it

SQUIRREL 2
Who you trying to impress now squirrel
Always trying to save the world

ELDER SQUIRREL
Enough Everyone go home If you want
to die it’s your choice But we can’t
risk any of our lives for your nonsense

The squirrels leave mocking Manny as they head back to their
nests The Elder Squirrel passes a large dark furred
stocky squirrel named Sable

ELDER SQUIRREL (cont’d)
Why do you let him influence your dear
sister like that I wouldn’t let them be
together they’re trouble together

SABLE
You’ re telling me

The Elder Squirrel walks off into the snowy night

MANNY
Wait I just want to help --

DREAM-BIRD
Let it go They can’t see it

MANNY
No they’re right
(suddenly saddened)
I don’t want to be responsible for your
life

SABLE (0OS)
You can say that again

Sable steps toward Manny

DREAM-BIRD
Sable

SABLE
I think you’re nuts
(beat)
She’s all I have left Now scram

MANNY
Well you don’t have to be rude
DREAM-BIRD
The two of you Will this never end

SABLE
Find another squirrel squirrel

MANNY
I’m not forcing anyone here But Dream-
Bird and Trashie believe I’m right

DREAM-BIRD
That’s right
SABLE
Well if she goes -- I go Someone has

to protect her from the rock-dwellers

DREAM-BIRD
I can take care of myself

MANNY
(seriously)
Sable if you go who’s going to take
care of gathering the nuts for the rest

SABLE
I’m going with the nuts
TRASHIE
Nuts I love nuts I will bring many
SABLE
I bet you will
(decided)
I’m going
DREAM-BIRD
(sadly)
Nuts
TRASHIE

I said I will bring them We should
leave now

SABLE
Yes it’s snowing and soon the rock-
dwellers will be gone --

MANNY
Then let’s meet by the frozen one but
first eat as much as we can The journey
will be long

They disperse

We PULL BACK to reveal the publicity sign they were sitting
on It’s a landscape rendering of a “new” Madison Park
painted to look lush and green again with trees everywhere
A cute CARICATURE OF A SQUIRREL is at the bottom of the sign
A comic strip dialogue bubble above his head reads “THANKS
TO NEW YORKERS 30 NEW TREES WILL BE PLANTED IN THE SPRING
KEEPING MADISON PARK GREEN FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE
DOGS AND SQUIRRELS”

EXT STATUE - MADISON PARK - NIGHT - LATER

The statue of a famous Civil War admiral turns white with the
falling snow Manny sits on the edge of the base

MANNY
(looking up)
I wish all rock-dwellers were actually
made of rock -- stiff like you You know
they might be right Maybe I’m just
crazy like Trashie

DREAM-BIRD (0S)
(jumping from above)
Hey
Manny falls back

MANNY
You scared me

DREAM-BIRD
I’m sorry about Sable tagging along He
ain’t happy unless he’s starting trouble

Trashie approaches

TRASHIE
(with a full mouth)
I -- take -- food Foo -- uu Gifts

Dream-Bird grabs a French fry from Trashie and gobbles it
down

Sable approaches

SABLE
Let’s get this over with Manny

DREAM-BIRD
Sable Why don’t you stay here with the
rest of ‘em Manny doesn’t need the
attitude It’s going to be hard enough
to find what we’re looking for

Manny steps toward Sable and looks up at the overgrown
squirrel

MANNY
No I want you to come so I can see
your face when you see what
(he points to his own head)
I see in here

SABLE
There’s nothing
(poking at Manny’s head)
in there but half an acorn

DREAM-BIRD
Break it up

Sable and Manny back down

TRASHIE
Plan What’s the plan

MANNY
Well here it is everyone All we have
to do is go up So I say we get to the
top of that one
Manny turns and points

In the BG is the beautiful Flatiron building It’s just
across the street most of its lights are out

MANNY (cont’d)
We just stay away from the fires

DREAM-BIRD
Let’s go
EXT 23RD STREET and MADISON AVE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

They race across a slushy 23rd Street

EXT FLATIRON BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

As they reach the building Dream-Bird easily climbs up its
heavily ornamented facade She leaps onto an air
conditioner

DREAM-BIRD
Come on we’1l be up in no time

We FOLLOW their tight convoy as they ascend to the top of The
Flatiron

EXT FLATIRON BUILDING - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Trashie and Manny have split from the group they’ve stopped
at the Flatiron’s mid point

TRASHIE
Please we stop Too tall Tired

MANNY
Okay Trashie let’s rest
(to the rest)
We’11 catch up with the others later

They hop to an nearby air conditioner unit

In the BG is Madison Park it’s lit only by an orange glow of
street lights It vanishes behind a curtain of flurries

INT BEDROOM - FLATIRON APARTMENT - LATER

A young boy DANNY is sitting on his bed He’s playing with
two toy figures His bedsheets consist of images of UFOs and
goofy caricatures of strange animals portraying aliens from
outer space

On his wall is a movie poster with a UFO in the center and
the SPACE PETS on top On the bottom is the title of the
family flick “SPACE PETS INVADE MANHATTAN” Beside the
poster is another smaller poster a teaser It reads
“SPACE PETS INVADE MANHATTAN AGAIN COMING SOON”

Danny’s toy figures are on the teaser poster They’re the
stars One is a PIGLET with a bushy mane of pink hair
Another is a spotted white CAT with massive bat-like ears

DANNY
(speaking for the Piglet)
The liberation of oppressed space pets
will start here in Madison Park
(speaking for the Cat)
Yes General Pinky We shall begin at
the dog park

Suddenly strange shadows cross Danny’s bedroom window - our
convoy of squirrels have decided to move on Danny turns
toward his window He’s shaking and drops his toy figures

DANNY (cont’d)
(trembling)
They’re real
(exhilarated)
I knew it

DANNY

bounces off his bed and springs out of his room

INT LIVING ROOM - FLATIRON APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONT’D

A large MAN wearing an exterminator’s uniform lounges in a
lazy-boy watching TV The tag on his jacket reads “Raoul’s
Rodent Removal”

hundreds of rats crawl out of a city sewer pipe

COMMENTATOR (VO)
Of all New York rodents such as mice
and squirrels rats are most feared

RAOUL (0S)
You got that right

LIVING ROOM

Covering every horizontal surface of the living room is an
army of dusty stuffed rodents Rats and squirrels are
stuffed in attack postures They look ridiculous - menacing
in the flickering light of a Christmas tree Several
pristine shotguns line the walls

Danny races to his father

DANNY
Daddy Daddy They’re here Out my
window They didn’t have time to freeze

RAOUL

INT BEDROOM - FLATIRON APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

As Danny’s father enters the shutters move The room fills
with scratching noises

RAOUL
(pushing his son back)

They found out where I live

Raoul runs out of the bedroom

EXT BEDROOM - FLATIRON APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Trashie is SCRATCHING at Danny’s bedroom window

MANNY
What’s wrong Trashie
TRASHIE
Nervous Very nervous --
MANNY
Why
TRASHIE

Too high I’ve never been above trash
can level

MANNY
It’s okay There’s nothing to fear --

Suddenly a DEAFENING BLAST rips a hole in the window
directly above their heads Shards of metal and glass fly in
everywhere Through the hole we see Raoul gripping his gun

Danny’s head springs into view - he’s jumping up and down on
his bed to see through the hole in his window

MANNY (cont’d)
(to everyone)
Up -- fast

As they leap upward another GUN SHOT annihilates the air
conditioner they were just on

Lights flicker on throughout the building

TRASHIE
The rock is turning to fire

Manny and Trashie press upward along the facade

MANNY
Keep on going

Further up Dream-Bird turns to look down at her companions

DREAM-BIRD
What’s going on down there

SABLE
Don’t worry about them

Sable tries to shove his sister forward but causes her to
lose her grip and FALL OFF the building

SABLE (cont’ d)
No

Dream bird sores past Manny with lightning precision he
CATCHES her tail but is merely pulled down by her weight

TRASHIE
Don’t go

AIR CONDITIONER

Dream-Bird crashes onto the shot-up air conditioner Manny
lands on top of her Dream-Bird looks into Manny’s eyes
They smile at each other Their moment is interrupted by a
LOUD SNAPPING They look into each other’s eyes with fear
A METALLIC TEARING SOUND fills the air

DREAM-BIRD
What’s that noise

TRASHIE
runs down the face of the building racing straight for them

TRASHIE
(screaming)
Manny don’t leave me

AIR CONDITIONER

DREAM-BIRDMANNY
Wait Stop

Trashie jumps and lands on top of them The shot-up air
conditioner buckles and BREAKS FREE of the window frame
They start to fall Their air conditioner HAMMERS into the
one directly below - stopping their descent

TRASHIE
Okay too heavy

MANNY
Let’s slowly get off Slowly

WINDOW LEDGE

As Trashie grabs hold of the nearest window ledge the lower
air conditioner GIVES WAY It falls RIPPING OFF several
air conditioners on its way down in a vertical domino effect

The pile of air conditioners crash down onto a parked car
It immediately catches on FIRE

Manny and Dream-Bird hold onto Trashie’s tail who barely
manages to hold onto the window’s edge with both of his
little paws

MANNY
Trashie hold on I’m gonna climb up
your back

TRASHIE’S

eyes are wide open His jaws are shut tight but his lips
are trembling Then without warning he lets out a FURIOUS
CRY and dashes straight up like a rocket
MANNY AND DREAM-BIRD

are surprised and just hold onto Trashie’s tail as he leaps
from floor to floor passing Sable at an incredible speed
They reach the top of the building in a flash

ROOF

Trashie jumps on top of a TV antenna as his two passengers
kiss the floor of the roof Trashie hugs the antenna with
his eyes shut

MANNY
Mother of all squirrels how did you do
that
TRASHIE
(panting)
Tail -- don’t touch -- tail
MANNY

Okay You got it buddy only pull on the
tail for emergencies Thanks I mean
sorry about that Now are you going to
come down from there

TRASHIE
Tail -- long-teeth bite -- tail

DREAM-BIRD
Poor little guy they bit his tail

SABLE
So where is it We’re up where’s the
park I don’t see it do you

Manny turns to see Sable emerging from the edge of the
building

MANNY
Well this might not be up enough

DREAM-BIRD
I didn’t think it would be that easy --

MANNY
(eyes widening)
Everyone -- turn around

Towering above the rest of the rocks is the Empire State
Building Its entire peak is glowing brightly tonight with
its seasonal holiday color of GREEN

MANNY (cont’d)
It’s even green at night It’sIt’s
It’s the park I knew it

Suddenly LOUD SIRENS echo in the city

EXT STREET - FLATIRON BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Two fire trucks arrive at the foot of the Flatiron

Every light in the surrounding buildings turn on
illuminating the city sky above in a pale orange glow

The SOUND of a BULL HORN RINGS INTO CLARITY

MAN’S VOICE (0S)
(through the bull horn)
Everyone stay calm I repeat
everyone

Flames from the car fire have spread onto the face of the
building A billow of smoke rises up the tall structure

The FIRE CHIEF (40s) a round man SHOUTS into the bull horn

FIRE CHIEF
Hose it down with all we’ve got men

The two fire trucks start to hose down the car and building
The closest truck unfolds its ladder extending it closer to
the roof of the building At the end of the ladder is the
LADDER FIREMAN He sprays the top of the building

EXT ROOF - FLATIRON BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Manny tries to pull Trashie off the antenna by his back legs
but his paws won’t let go Trashie’s eyes are glued shut

MANNY
Help me But don’t touch his tail

The three of them join in pulling Trashie closer until the
antenna forms an arc

4l

DREAM-BIRD
Trashie you knuckle butt open your
eyes It’s The Park

At the word “park” Trashie opens his eyes and sees the
Empire State Building He screams scaring everyone Manny
lets go of his legs The antenna acts like a catapult
sending Trashie through the billow of smoke and off the
building

DREAM-BIRD (cont’d)
Oh no

MANNY
Trashie

Manny runs toward the wall of smoke with desperate searching
eyes Suddenly the top of the ladder SLICES through the
smoke and connects with the rooftop The stream of its water
hose is now aiming at the smoke filled sky

Trashie is clinging to the LADDER FIREMAN’S face

LADDER FIREMAN
(muffled)
What the --

DREAM-BIRD
Let go of him rock-dweller

Manny leaps onto the Fireman’s arm and attempts to bite
through his suit Dream-Bird jumps and lands on the control
panel of the ladder It swivels violently SCRAPING the top
of the building Sable jumps onto the ladder Without
hesitating he slides down its rail bar - ignoring his
companions

The Fire Chief SCREAMS into his bull horn
FIRE CHIEF
Lower that ladder you idiots What’s
going on up there
FIREMAN

Chief it looks like he’s being attacked
by something

EXT FIRE LADDER - FLATIRON BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

The descending ladder spins about nearly missing the side of
a neighboring building

Let go of him or I’11 bite your arm off

Trashie hears Manny and smiles

TRASHIE
My friend

LADDER FIREMAN
(muffled)
Get this thing off me

MANNY
Jump off Trashie -- now

Trashie lets go and slides down the Fireman’s coat and grabs
onto the railing

Manny and Dream-Bird abandon their prey and follow Trashie
sliding on the railing like a giant staircase banister

Then send him to a shrink

We SINK DOWN to reveal Manny Dream-Bird and Trashie huddled
underneath the closest fire truck They’re shivering

DREAM-BIRD
Where did my brother go

TRASHIE
I hope he’s not hurt

MANNY
I don’t think he stayed up there

SABLE (0S)
You’re right So what do we do now

Sable emerges from behind a tire looking quite annoyed
MANNY
Sable if you still want to follow we’re

going this way

He points toward 5th Avenue

DREAM-BIRD

That must be “town” and then it’s “up”
TRASHIE

My friend knows He take me --
SABLE

And how do we get there
MANNY

(beat)
We walk

Manny takes a step forward Suddenly he turns around
blinded by two headlights Dream-Bird pulls him to safety as
a NEW YORK TIMES VAN SCREECHES to a halt directly in front of
them

GEORGE (30s) a journalist bursts out of the van like a
General surveying a battlefield

Lagging behind is Karen (now in her early 20s) She has
grown into a pretty woman Despite her relaxed attire she
looks nervous - new to the job There’s a laptop strapped
around her neck like a camera - it rests on her chest

George snaps pictures of the scene with his digital camera

GEORGE
What kind of a mess is this
(whipping around)
Karen Pop her open And coffee lots
of coffee

Karen pops open the laptop keeping it on her neck like a
robot opening a panel on its chest George types away with
his left hand while taking pictures with his right

GEORGE (cont’d)

KAREN
How can I get it while you’re typing

GEORGE
Just ask “Can I get your coffee now

KAREN

sighs and goes to their NY Times Van

(looking at the coffee)
Why do you have two coffees I can only
drink one at a time sweetie

KAREN

Karen puts down her coffee next to the PC Trashie held by

Manny

reaches out to grab it but it’s just out of reach

Karen grabs the laptop and lifts it up presenting it to

George

KAREN
Here you go

For a second George doesn’t realize that four squirrels are
sitting on the keyboard They look at each other
dumbfounded

Trashie grabs the coffee cup out of George’s hand drinks it
in one LOUD GULP and drops the cup He looks into George’s
startled eyes and lets out a LOUD BELCH George SCREAMS He
grabs the laptop and throws it like a frisbee into the middle
of the snow covered street with our squirrels still on it

skids across 23rd street

Suddenly the thing opens it’s mouth and releases a horrible
ROAR that echoes throughout the sewer We see that it’s a
young ALLIGATOR The mice stumble back in fear

mangled hot dogs A dozen differently colored drinks are
poured into bottle caps
The mice are watching the squirrels’ eat

MANNY
I just want you to live in a world where
you don’t have to fear strangers Where

Manny reaches into his thick fur and pulls off the tiny bell
from Squeaky’s collar The bell emits a LOUD CHIME that
echoes in the sewer inset

MANNY
For you

DREAM-BIRD
Squeaky’s bell Why

MANNY
Deep down I think I’m doing this because
I want you to

DREAM-BIRD

STOUT MOUSE
If you so desire we’ll help but we only
dwell under If you seek higher grounds
our six legged friend Ricky will show
you the way He knows every inch of this

All the mice start to shout “Ricky Ricky”

Suddenly the crowd opens to let someone enter but no one is
there From below right under Dream-Bird’s nose we hear
the faint SOUND of a HIGH-PITCHED VOICE (with an Italian
accent)

RICKY THE ROACH (0S)
What’s da matta fur butt You lost or
somethin’

Dream-Bird looks down to find a skinny cockroach RICKY THE
ROACH right in front of her She jumps back in surprise
Trashie drops to his feet and sniffs Ricky’s head
RICKY THE ROACH (cont’d)
What’s with you chump Didn’t your mama
tell you it’s bad mannas to stare people
down

Ricky pushes Trashie out of the way

INT CEILING - NYC SEWER - NIGHT

Manny and the gang are escorted by Ricky The Roach along a
cable that reaches up and into a crack in the concrete
ceiling

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT - LATER

They soon find themselves on the roof of an elevator The
elevator sits at the bottom of a massive shaft that seems to
extend forever Long black cables hang about like vines

Manny grabs the greasy cable his hand immediately slips off

RICKY THE ROACH
Okay -- follow me It’s a long way up

Ricky jumps on the cable and has no problem ascending

MANNY
(nervous)
It’s a little slippery

RICKY THE ROACH
Scared to get dirty Cause Dino’s
garbage holds the best spaghetti in New
York It’s been simmering for a couple
days now Yummie

ALL THE SQUIRRELS
No thank you

RICKY THE ROACH
Mamma Mia che passa

Manny grabs the cable getting fresh grease all over his paws
and fur He follows Ricky who’s already far ahead

MANNY
(to the others)
It’s slippery but we can make it

Dream-Bird makes a disgusted face as she grabs the cable
Trashie licks it and recoils in disgust They make their way
up the cable

Their bodies are quickly covered in black grease

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT
Trashie and Dream-Bird are still sliding down the cable

A big gooey mass of grease has accumulated under Trashie’s
butt He continues to scrape the cable clean with every inch
of their descent The mass of grease becomes so big it
forms a cushion stopping them in their fall

DREAM-BIRD
(disgusted)
Look at me I’m a grease ball

Suddenly we hear the SOUND of an APPROACHING CRY Dream-

Bird looks up

DREAM-BIRD’S POV - MANNY

falls head first toward her and Trashie Manny hits them

Trashie is PUSHED INSIDE the mass of goo Dream-Bird looks
down to find Trashie He pops his head out of the grease

She laughs Manny looks at Dream-Bird they’re all caked in
grease He laughs

DREAM-BIRD
What’s so funny
MANNY
You’re a mess It’s funny cause you

always like to be so tidy

Dream-Bird looks down to see the elevator approaching She
hardly has time to scream when it hits them in an EXPLOSION

TRASHIE
Grease is good for fur

MANNY

We’re going up Dream-Bird we’re going

He grabs her in his arms She’s pleasantly surprised and
looks him in the eyes

kiss you

bends his body to look at her face upside down

for a lift We would’ve had time for
pizza

She grabs him in her greasy paw
DREAM-BIRD
Listen roachie -- I’m a vegetarian But

I’ve been known to eat bugs Am I clear

He quietly looks at her and swallows

on the white wall Their greasy little bodies are bathed in
the green holiday light of the Empire State Building

Trashie plops down next to Manny splattering everyone with
more grease Manny grabs him by the neck and squeezes -
grease oozes from his fur

emerges proudly revealing its first rays of the day -
illuminating the deck Suddenly the Empire State Building’s
green holiday “night-light” BLINKS OFF

clinging to it as if he was in a cage He looks out at New
