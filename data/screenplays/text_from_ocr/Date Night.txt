FADE IN
INT BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

A modest city bedroom Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes
sit on one side of the room Sc-orLes -moving in

In his bathrobe PHIL FOSTER a good looking guy in his
mid-20s hums to himself as he looks through stacks of
WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed Just as he
finishes up a pile and starts another beautiful CLARA
FOSTER in a bathrobe too jumps across his lap

PHIL
Hey hey Careful Clara You were the
one who told me not to mess up the
precious picture piles
he gives him a long slow kiss

PHIL (CONT D )
Minty fresh

CLARA
That was nice

PHIL
It was nice

CLARA

Hey from now on when you change the
toilet paper could you just make sure it
is out

PHIL
(CHUCKLES)

Wow She moves in and the honeymoons
over
CLARA
Oh believe me were just getting
started Phil

PHIL
(reaches into picture pile)
Look at this one of your Mom with me I
mean that woman cant contain her Love

ON the wedding picture RUTH Clarasmother stands
stiffly next to Phil with an expression like shes ankle
deep in a manure bin

CLARA

(LAUGHS)
She just takes a while to warm up You
guys are gonna be best buddies You
picked a favorite of us yet

Phil finds the picture handing it to Clara

CLARA (CONTD)
Thats exactly the one I picked

Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed
Its a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING They look
joyous excited A young couple with the world in front
of them

PHIL
Man I wish I was them
Phil kisses the back of Claras neck but her smile fades
as she stares at the picture He notices

PHIL (CONTD)
WHAT IS

CLARA
I just when I was growing up my Mom
and Dad had a picture just like this
Now they cant even acknowledge each
other
Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze

CLARA (CONTD)
Lets always remember to have some time
thats just for the two of us No matter
what else comes up in our lives - if its
work or friends or when we have kids-

PHIL
Were having kids With an S

(CLARA LAUGHS)
OK fine But I promise you its never
gonna happen to us

CLARA
Yeah well see if youll be saying that
when Im long in the tooth

PHIL
Youll be even hotter long toothed
Right now to be honest Clara theyre a
little stumpy

CZ

(GIGGLES
Oh really
As Phil climbs on top and kisses her he reaches over and
turns off the light Suddenly we hear the piles of
pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground Beat

CLARA (CONTD)
Phil Tell me it wasnt the pictures

PHIL
wasnt the pictures

CLARA
You know how long that took

PHIL
Well fix the picture piles Clara
Weve got all the time in the world
From now on everythings gonna be just
about us
Suddenly a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness
OLLIE (V0)

MOM
The Talking Heads Once in a Lifetime kicks

INT PHIL AND CLARAS BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING

Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara an
ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 645 am

E

OLLIE (0S)

Mo-om

Its SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir -id groan
in bed Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER

while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a
T-shirt Without saying a word they rise out of each
side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite
directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the
hall and Phil to the bathroom

OLLIE (0S) (CONTD)
Mom Mom Mom

CLARA
Im coming Ollie

INT OLLIES ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

As the Talking Heads song continues Clara makes Ollies
bed while OLLIE 5 plays with LEGOs on the floor Phil
showered and dressed in a suit walks quickly past the
doorway carrying a briefcase his eyes glued to a stack
of PAPERS in his hand

CLARA
Uh Phil

Phil doubles back still looking at the papers

PHIL
Yep
CLARA
I need to switch Ive got an open
house
Phil obviously doesnt want to be bothered right now but
contains it

PHIL
Really

CLARA
Yeah Really
As Clara walks quickly past him Phil claps his hands
together

PHIL
OK so I say today we go for the slacker
look - cool yet approachable

OLLIE
Yeah well Mom says that
Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair

PHIL
Oh Well thats cool too

INT PHIL AND CLARAS BEDROOMBATHROOM - SAME

The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly
through the bedroom She lets out a YELP as her shin
SMASHES INTO PHILS DRESSER DRAWER - hes left them open
She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom then
stops in the doorway WATER covers the floor Grabbing

a towel she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror
As she picks up her toothbrush she notices its WET as
well

CLARA
Ech Mine
She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts
brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of
razor hairs and bits of toothpaste
Disgusted Clara reaches for the Kleenex box only to
discover its EMPTY She tosses the box in the trash and
shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper

Seeing the roll she sighs as she takes it out of the
holder turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT
As the CREDITS END the Talking Heads song fad

NT KITCHEN

Phil pen in hand is focused again on his papers as
Ollie now in the preppie outfit watches him and waits
at the table Phil finally notices

PHIL
What

OLLIE
Breakfast

PHIL

(HOPPING UP)
Oh Yeah sorry Your Dads a boob
today Whats it gonna be
Ollie peers down the hallway to see if theres any sign
of his tom

OLLIE
How about some Captain Crunch
Phil gets an idea and writes zickly

PHIL
(DISTRACTED)

OL

PHIL
Uh yeah Sure
Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out
cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara dressed
in a suit comes into the room and spots it

CLARA
Ah ah ah whats that Ollie You had a
bowl yesterday

Clara glances at Phil

Clara eyebrows raised eyes the Captain Crunch already

PHIL

(SHRUGS)

CLARA

PHIL
Oh Whoops

CLARA

(SIGHS)

As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie
and a glass for himself he finishes the carton Peeking
back over his shoulder he sees Claras dialing with the
phone to her ear as she readies Ollies lunch He
stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back quickly
returning the carton to the fridge

CLARA (CONTD)

(INTO PHONE)
Hey Jane Im getting a late start but
Ill be there as soon as I can

PHIL
Sorry I dropped the ball Its this
Quarterly Report to Mr Rivers today

CLARA
(focusing on Ollies lunch)
Ollie do you want a banana

PHIL

CLARA
(not looking at him)

animal metaphors that you dont

PHIL

(BEAT)
So I should probably get going With the
highway construction it takes forever to
get downtown these days
CLARA
OK Have a good day
Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
off He looks at her strangely Noticing Clara quickly
kisses Phil on the cheek

CLL -- (CONT D )
Sorry Your mouthy was still ail milky

PHIL
Sorry for the milky mouth
He heads out With a sigh Clara spots Phils left his 1lizl
dirty glass on the counter She cleans it in the sink
then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk
in her own coffee A DRIBBLE comes out Shaking her
head she tosses the carton in the trash

EXT FRONT OF FOSTER S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
next to the house his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks
a newspaper off his lawn

CHAZ (0S)
Well well Were up bright and early

PHIL
Yes we are
(under his breath)
ike you say to me every morning
Reaching the carport Phil scoots between his car and
Claras He tries to open his drivers door but Clara
car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
inches He tries to SQL-Z- IN but ends up GETTING
STUCK halfway

PHIL (CONTD)

Dislodging himself Phil sidesteps between the cars and
peers around the other side of Claras TONS of room
Shaking his head Phil crosses to his cars passenger
side OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the
front passenger door Frustrated Phil hops in the rear
and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the drivers
seat

HONKING
EXT EISENHOWER HIGHWAY - A LITTLE LATER

The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD

HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE Phil scowls then checks his
watch

EXT STREET

(WHISPERS)
I never knew I could still get my leg
back that far

CLARA
Too much information Jane

INT OPEN HOUSE

Clara and Jane speak loudly to each other as they each
move quickly around different parts of the vacant home
cleaning and inspecting

The divorce was the best thing that ever

happened to me Seriously You know

that great nervous feeling in your

stomach Where you dont know whats

going to happen next

On her way down the hall Clara spots a mark up ahead on
the wall She reaches into her large purse and pulls out
a mini-409 mister and a rag With the aim of a
SHARPSHOOTER she sprays ahead wiping the mark as she
passes

JANE (0S) (CONTD)

With Larry I lost that Everything had

just become routine you know Boring

Janes words hit Clara close to home Passing on through
the kitchen Clara notices that the REFRIGERATOR makes a
weird loud buzzing noise

JANE (CONTD)
But now all of a sudden Im alive again

CLARA

Clara takes out her frustration on the ridge kicki
the side and silencing it

CLARA (CONTD)

In a dark wood office with STUFFED AR iz L HEADS lining

Planetarium to watch the sunrise

PHIL
Where I held your hand for the first

recently
Phil doesnt understa

CLARA (CONTD)

like him could do if he got someone less

Mumbling angrily Clara puts her car in drive and steps

on it Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels

smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION They race

past Frank again who angrily whips the Towncar around in

pursuit

Looking over his shoulder Phil tries to steer their

conjoined cars down the middle of the street but he and

Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer ildly

back and forth They hit the curb at an angle and -JcK

Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a
frustrated sigh

EXT DESERTED STREETS - LATER

Phil and Clara walk quickly down the street as they piece
things together

PHIL
The Mayor must have gone to Stocktons
club one night He saw Dora working
there and obviously gave some sign that
he was interested

CLARA
So much for Mr Squeaky Clea

PHIL
Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and
convinces her to take him up on it so
they could photograph it and blackmail
him

CLARA
They knew it was an election year and he
would have to pay them whatever they
asked

PHIL
But somehow Stockton found out about the
photos too and wanted that power over the
mayor himself

CLARA
So he sent his guys to the restaurant to
intercept the Gales and get the photos

PHIL
But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed
before the Mayor even had a chance to
show up
Phil thinks He snaps his fingers

CLARA
What
PHIL
If we could find some way to get in touch
with the mayor directly without anyone
else knowing there actually might be a
way out of this for us
Clara thinks for a moment A light comes to her eyes

CLARA

So lets do this again sometime
CLARA
(SMILE)
like that

For the first time the whole night THEY KISS
Interlocking fingers they head inside closing their
front door behind them

FACE OUT

THE END
