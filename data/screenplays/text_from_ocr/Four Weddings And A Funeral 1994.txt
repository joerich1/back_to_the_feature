SCARLETT faffs a little picking up the map for the first
time They shoot past an exit sign

SCARLETT
Its exit 13

CHARLES

CHARLES jams on the brake Reverses 50 yards back up the

motorway Almost dies then shoots up the sliproad of exit

21 EXT SCARLETTS MINI COUNTRY LANE DAY 21

An idyllic stretch of summer countryside - suddenly the Mini
shoots into shot and out

22 EXT WEDDING 1 COUNTRY CHURCH DAY 22

It is an idyllic sun-soaked small country church in
Berkshire Scarletts mini screeches up jams on the brakes
and skids into a lay-by 100 yards away CHARLES and SCARLETT
leap out of the car and dress in their formal gear CHARLES
zips up the back of SCARLETTs dress and it catches

CHARLES
Fuck fuck fuckity fuck

SCARLETT straightens his tie - then holds his shoulder and
looks at hin
SCARLETT
Yes -— fuckable

Over her shoulder a large Rolls Royce appears and shoots past
them It is the bridal car They look at each other Tiny
pause

CHARLES
Bugger

They sprint towards the church THE BRIDE is just getting out
of the car CHARLES and SCARLETT whip past with a smile and
a friendly wave

23 INT WEDDING 1 COUNTRY CHURCH DAY 23

The Church is glowing white and be-decked with flowers
CHARLES and SCARLETT survey the weddingly scene of hats and
big shoulders Finally their eyes fall upon their friends
who weve also been following They head for them CHARLES
knows he is late

FIONA
There is a sort of greatness in your
lateness
CHARLES

Thanks I try

SCARLETT slips in - CHARLES acknowledges them all with a wave
and heads on quickly up the aisle to where the groom is
standing His name is ANGUS and hes a little tense He has
a small crafted orange beard

CHARLES
Christ In sorry Angus
Inexcusable I1l be killing myself
after the service of course

ANGUS
Doesnt matter - Tom was standing
by

CHARLES
Thank you Ton Youre a saint

Anddisastrous haircut

TOM
Thanks

TOM gives an enthusiastic thumbs up and heads back down to
join the friends
ANGUS
As long as you havent forgotten the
rings

CHARLES
Nope

CHARLES pats his pocket confidently When ANGUS looks away we
see a look of concern slip over CHARLESs face - he has just
patted an empty pocket

At that moment there is a slam of the heavy church doors -
everyone turns around and a GIRL WITH A LARGE BLUE HAT walks
in and down the aisle She vaguely uses the hat to shield
herself against curious eyes

CHARLES
Tssk I hate people being late

ANGUS appreciates the effort to relax him and gives Charles a
half smile and at that moment the Wedding March starts

CHARLES
Here we go

ANGUS turns to look down the aisle at his bride CHARLES
feels his top pocket - no luck there either

CcuT TO

The Bride LAURA on the arm of her father with two little
and one fully grown bridesmaid LYDIA LAURA looks a little
over-fulsome - the row of friends turns as she passes

SCARLETT
Oo isnt she lovely

FIONA
Scarlett youre blind She looks
like a big meringue

ANGUS smiles at CHARLES to share in the joy at his beautiful
bride CHARLES smiles back slightly nervously

CUT TO
The Couple as the VICAR starts the service

VICAR
Dear friends - what a joy it is to
welcome you to our Church on this
wonderful day for Angus and Laura

CHARLES looks around behind him trying to find a way out of
his dilemma His eyes land on the GIRL IN THE BLUE HAT Her
hair is lit by a ray of light coming through the stained glass

window CHARLES can only see part of her face Then he
remembers hes got a more important immediate problem

VICAR
Before we start the wedding service
let us sing hymn number 135

They stand - there is a slight wobble on the organ and a
grinding up to tempo as we hear the intro to Jerusalem

GARETH
Great grandmother on the organ
Thats nice

MATTHEW
Quiet

cUT INTO

The singing CHARLES is trying to attract the attention of
his friends all in their row Finally MATTHEW sees him -
CHARLES manages to mime the problem MATTHEW smacks his head
in mock despair CHARLES does a little plea He needs help

MATTHEW whispers something in GARETHS ear GARETH holds out
his hands to reveal no ring He in turn whispers to FIONA

CUT THROUGH Four pairs of ring-less hands

MATTHEW
(Loud whispering)
Scarlett

SCARLETT gives him a big innocent smile - she is the last
resort

VICAR
Dearly beloved - we are gathered
here in the sight of God and in the
face of this congregation

CHARLES
(To Angus)
Back in a sec

ANGUS looks alarmed as CHARLES walks right to the side of the
Church MATTHEW comes to meet him - they stop at THE BLUE HAT
GIRL MATTHEW does the subtle hand-over without us seeing
the rings
VICAR

Therefore if any man can show any

just cause or impediment why they

may not be lawfully joined together

let them speak now

CHARLES stops for a second - doesnt want to make any noise
and be mistaken for an objector

CARRIE - THE BLUE HAT GIRL
(To her neighbour)
I suppose the fact hes a terrible
lay doesnt count

CHARLES hears the comment - now he likes her even more But
he has to concentrate on the matter in hand

VICAR
Do you promise to love him comfort
him honour and keep him in sickness
and in health and forsaking all
others keep thee only unto him so
long as ye both shall live

LAURA
(With total love)
I do
CHARLES slips in comfortably next to Angus
CUT ON A little later

VICAR
Do you have the ring

THE VICAR moves towards CHARLES holding open the Bible
CHARLES takes a little step forward and puts the still unseen
rings on the book THE VICAR looks slightly surprised

VICAR
With this ring I thee wed with ny
body I thee worship and with all ny
worldly goods I thee endow

ANGUS
With this ring I thee wed with my
body I thee worship and with all ny
worldly goods I thee endow

ANGUS slips the ring on to LAURAS finger It is a huge piece
of pink and purple junk jewellery ANGUS looks startled
CHARLES plays innocent and very formal Then LAURA slips
hers onto ANGUS hand - it is a skull and cross-bones

CUT TO
A 35 year old man with not much hair

GEORGE
If I speak with the tongues of men
and of angels but have not love I
am become a sounding brass or a
clanging cymbal

GARETH
Good point

CUT TO

A couple (CLAUDIA and CRAIG) with an acoustic guitar playing
John Denvers classic hit Annies Song It is a sister and
her boyfriend filling in while the couple sign the register

CLAUDIA and CRAIG
you fill up my senses like a night
in a forest

GARETH has his head in his hands in despair A baby starts to
‘talk

GARETH
(Raising his head)
0 bravo

FIONA

This is the sort of song that makes
you cry isnt it Scarlett

SCARLETT
(In tears)
Is it

cuT TO

The newly-weds leave the Church the Toccata plays and babies
cry in harmony CHARLES stands at the door as the guests
leave Everyone knows him CARRIE passes

CHARLES
Great hat

CARRIE
Thanks - I bought it specially

She moves on with a slightly wry smile Shes American He
‘likes her

24 EXT WEDDING 1 COUNTRY CHURCH DAY 24

The wedding photos are being taken Six quick stills of the
family In the course of the shots a 6 YEAR OLD BOY goes
under the skirt of LAURA and emerges smiling Then is hit

Meanwhile CHARLESS friends gather on the sidelines a real
group comfortable MATTHEW GARETH FIONA SCARLETT TOM

sign - DAVID is his brother - and deaf (NOTE all underlined
lines of dialogue will appear on the screen as subtitles)

CHARLES

FIONA

CHARLES
Thats a relief

He sees CARRIE walking away from the Church She removes her
exotic blue hat and casually throws it into a dustbin She
then leans over slips off her dark blue tights and throws
them away too She walks on - CHARLES watches her go

GARETH
Right - reception

They all turn to go
25 EXT C YLANE DAY 25

The guests are heading down a lane away from the church
towards a huge barn There is a lovely rural feeling to
everything as though the wedding is a harvest festival

There are pink bows on the sheep they pass They chat as they
walk

TOM
Anyone else tread in a cowpat No -
thought not - see you in a mo

Dont want to blow my chances for
romance by smelling of dung all the
way through the reception

FIONA
Do you think Id hate him as much if
he wasnt my brother God I never
know what to say in these wretched
line-ups

GARETH
oO its a cinch - just say the bride
looked beautiful and isnt it a
lovely day

To the side we see TOM rub his foot violently against a bale
of hay Then another bale gently topples onto hin

FIONA
We cant do better than that

MATTHEW
Traditionally no Unless you want
to try “you must be very proud

26 INT BARN RECEPTION LINE DAY 26

Wife LAURA is hugely gushy laughy hugging everyone Husband
ANGUS is smiling which is unusual for him Then there are
the FOUR PARENTS At the end stand various sisters brothers
and bridesmaids

FIONA
(So sincerely)
You must be very proud

TOM
(Slightly hay-covered)
Hello

GARETH and MATTHEW just arriving at the PARENTS end of the
line

GARETH
Quite superb - its made Matthew and
I think quite seriously about the
possibility of getting married

FATHER OF THE BRIDE
Really And which are the lucky
young ladies

GARETH is about to explain that isnt exactly what he means
when MATTHEW interrupts

MATTHEW
Unfortunately they were busy

GARETH
Yes the life of the air hostess is
not an easy one

THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE is a little over made-up

CHARLES
(Whispered to Scarlett)
Clothes by Coco Chanel make-up by
Coco the Clown

CHARLES now reaches THE MOTHER OF THE BRIDE and is as charming
as possible

CHARLES (cont)
She was very beautiful - although
perhaps not as lovely as her
mother

MOTHER blushes happily and introduces him to CLAUDIA the John
Denver singer

MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
Why thank you - this is Claudia
shes done all the catering

CHARLES shakes the hand of the over-excited Claudia

CHARLES
Excellent If its anything like
your music weve really got
something to look forward to

SCARLETT is just behind

SCARLETT
I thought she looked unbe-fucking-
lievably pretty didnt you

MOTHER OF THE BRIDE
Ah yes

SCARLETT
Im surprised your son just didnt
give her one on the spot there and
then

FATHER OF THE BRIDE
Well quite

SCARLETT has no real sense of what is the right or the wrong
thing to say at any given time

27 INT BARN RECEPTION DAY 27

The barn is decked out with beams and flowers and ribbons -
full of tables with a long table at the end on a slightly
raised dais Expensive but with a nice homey feeling to it
The family are upper middle class there are lots of guests
wearing dark suits not wedding coats - and there are lots of
flower pattern dresses

Throughout the reception the background action is full of the
business of weddings pairs of old people standing saying
nothing old person talking to young person and yawning -
people burning fingers on little sausages - children fighting
and pulling table cloths and skirts down

CUT TO
OUR GROUP in their wedding coats and frocks ready for the

fray - a wedding Magnificent Seven (actually 8) They stand

CHARLES winds through people looking out for CARRIE - standing
on his toes he sees her grabs a glass and moves towards her
- but at the last moment another man joins her

CHARLES

Reaching for the spare glass

CHARLES
If you like
GARETH

CHARLES spies CARRIE but again she is headed off by another
good-looker - she is clearly much feted by men

CHARLES

CHARLES heads for the drinks table to stock up again by the
time he turns shes alone again He makes it to her with a
few rushed Hellos on the way

CHARLES

CARRIE takes in totally that this is the most embarrassing
moment and leaves them to it amused

CARRIE

CHARLES

CARRIE moves away -she helps herself to a drink She looks
around and there in the corner sees CHARLES deliberately hit
his head against the wall once

When he stands straight again an old lady passes his line of
vision He clearly knows her and smiles politely

CHARLES

watching her - a little fed up He glides into his position
on the long raised-up top table and introduces himself to the
very old indeed MAN next to hin

CHARLES
How do you do - my name is Charles

OLD MAN
‘Dont be ridiculous Charles died 20

MAN 1
No thank you

CHARLES is watching CARRIE and listening to the OLD MAN
The camera lingers on CARRIE while the OLD MAN talks

TOM
Absolutely Splendid tuck

Sound of a banging spoon CHARLES stands He speaks in a very
self-effacing manner

CHARLES
Ladies and gentlemen - Im sorry to
drag you from your delicious
desserts there are just one or two
little things I feel I should say as
best man

The guests turn to listen to him

Before I start my speech can I just
say this - I am as ever in
bewildered awe of any couple who
make the commitment that Angus and

Laura have made this morning True
love is a very rare and splendid
thing - and I think we see it here
today

ANGUS and LAURA are touched

This is only the second time Ive
ever been a best man I hope I did
the job all right that time - the

po 4 couple in question at least are
still talking to me Unfortunately
theyre not talking to each other -
the divorce came through a couple of
months ago

) CUT TO
) CARRIE laughing brightly - then back to CHARLES

CHARLES (cont)

But Im assured it had absolutely
io nothing to do with me Apparently
Belinda knew that Anthony had slept
with her younger sister before I
mentioned it in the speech The
fact that hed also slept with her
mother came as a surprise - but I
think it was incidental to the
nightmare of violence and
recrimination which became their two
week marriage Anyway - enough of
that Angus has asked me to talk a
little bit about hisromantic
past

Laughter CHARLES looks back to where CARRIE was - but shes

gone
CUT ON TO
CHARLES (cont)
Ladies and gentlemen - the adorable
couple
ALL stand to toast

the first time he has ever heard pop music

SCARLETT
Come on Charles - give us a dance -

CHARLES

SCARLETT
Okay

CHARLES is clearly looking for CARRIE - but then there she is

on the dance floor with one of her dinner companions

CHARLES
Damn

SCARLETT starts dancing wildly but enthusiastically with TOM
the worst dancer in the world but the keenest

Beside them is GARETH twisting with great vigour with a 50
year old lady

CHARLES sits down and looks back at CARRIE and her man
dancing quite close MATTHEW sits down beside him As they
talk we intercut with the dance floor

MATTHEW
I remember the first time I saw
Gareth on the dance floor I feared
lives would be lost

GARETH now doing a Saturday Night Fever style dance

MATTHEW (cont)
But actually hes surprisingly safe

SCARLETT is now dancing very badly indeed Beside her is a
ten year old boy really getting down then joined by GARETH
doing exactly the same Hi-energy dance Beside them is
CARRIE

MATTHEW
Pretty girl the one you cant keep
your eyes off Is it love at first
sight

CHARLES is slightly thrown by Matthews perception

CHARLES
Good lord no - its the bloke shes
dancing with - Im sure I played

rugby with him at school - trying to
remember which position he played

GARETH is now doing the bump with a hefty grandmother
Bump

CHARLES (cont)

fancy to someone at a wedding do

mermaid while his friends are being eaten -by sharks

34 INT RECEPTION THE BOATMAN NIGHT 34

It is now about one in the morning Very quiet CHARLES sees
the bell to ring on the front desk but just before he does so
looks left and sees a plume of smoke rising from a large
leather armchair in the sitting room next door CHARLES walks
towards it

CHARLES
Hello

CARRIE leans over - and looks at him quizzically
CHARLES

In the end it turned out there

WAITER leaves and CHARLES turns back to address CARRIE - but
shes disappeared Its clear why when GEORGE enters the
confident balding plump annoying man who read the lesson in
Church

GEORGE

CHARLES
(In a fluster)

They settle CHARLES in the chair GEORGE on the sofa CARRIE
raises from behind the sofa and looks humorously exasperated
at CHARLES

GEORGE
Lovely wedding

CHARLES
Yes

CARRIE appears behind GEORGE crawling towards the door

GEORGE
I was at school with his brother
Bufty - tremendous bloke I was his
fag Buggered me senseless but it
taught me a thing or two about life

Reaction off CHARLES Meanwhile CARRIE on her knees is
almost at the door The WAITER comes in again She makes a
shush sign at him and beckons him to follow her

GEORGE
Where do you know them from

CHARLES
University

He sees CARRIE now talking to the WAITER outside the room

GEORGE
O splendid splendid Yes Didnt
go myselfcouldnt see the point
When youre working the money
markets what use are the novels of
Wordsworth going to be eh

CHARLES
Good point Shakespeares short
stories equally pointless

WAITER re-enters formally

WAITER

CHARLES
My wife

WAITER

CHARLES is slightly nervous

CARRIE
Hi

CHARLES
Hello Sorry about that

CARRIE
No thats fine - he was hard to get
rid of (Pause) Its a sad day when
a girls got to ask a boy up to her
bedroom to get any privacy

CHARLES
Yes - perhaps we could skulk around
here and then go back down

CARRIE
Thats a thought I dont usually
skulk a lot but I suppose I could
skulk if skulking was required Do
you skulk regularly

CHARLES
No I dont normally think of nyself
as a skulker

CARRIE
Okay so just come in and skulk for
a while and well see

36 INT ROOM 12 THE BOATMAN NIGHT 36

No - it doesnt always happen You
may now kiss the bride isnt
actually in the Book of Common

Prayer
CARRIE
I always worry that Id go too far
CHARLES
How far do you think too far would
be
CARRIE

I dont knowI think (gives him
a peck on the cheek) thatwould be
all right

CHARLES
O yes I think so In fact it
might be thought a
littledismissive
CARRIE
Maybe Maybe this (a kiss on the
mouth) would be better

CHARLES
Yes You wouldnt want to take it
any further I mean(a long kiss)
That might be taking it a little
far And

This becomes a voice over as we pan across her bedroom

CHARLES
-what about this - do you think
the vicar would think things had
slipped a little out of his control

They are naked and making love on the bed

CARRIE
I think he mightId be very
surprised if we werent enjoying
ourselves more than the honeymoon
couple

CHARLES
Im sure we are

CARRIE
Why do you think it was called a
honeymoon

CHARLES
Im not sure - I suppose ‘honey
because its as sweet as honey - and
moon because it was the first time
a husband saw his wifes bottom

She laughs - fer all his early unsureness she makes him
relaxed by being so totally relaxed herself

suspect things are going to go very well between then

embarrassment despite the fact that this is a bad moment his
hopes had risen high

card on Georges present He smiles happily and heads down
the sweeping staircase to the baliroon

He passes the long queue and simply joins his friends at the
front near the beginning of the receiving line The bride is
in her still splattered dress

Standing at the front of the line is someone ‘liveried The
Master of Ceremonies He dips his head and has a word with
every guest very discreetly

MASTER OF CEREMONIES

loving him no-one else stands a
chance

MRS BEAUMONT
Bad luck

half so I dont think it counts

Si INT HOTEL CORRIDOR NIGHT 5i

CHARLES with the sound of music in the background - he
looks along a corridor then nips into a little room where
he can be alone

52 INT HOTEL ROOM NIGHT 52

It contains just a bed and a dressing table On the bed is
a suit and a girls skirt and blouse He goes to the
window and peaceful at last looks out over London

There is a sound - he turns around and sees the door
opening BERNARD and LYDIA enter the room - they dont see
him - but turn and quickly lock the door It is in fact
the room for changing into their going away clothes

CHARLES is a little worried by this
BERNARD
Ill turn off the light - dont want
to attract attention

CHARLES nods The light goes out in the darkness we hear
rustling

LYDIA
Wait a minute this is no fun I
want to see my lovely husband

The light goes on again They are half undressed and
CHARLES is stranded directly behind them they do not see
hin

CUT IN close on them then pan around - and CHARLES has
disappeared The couple are now almost naked The camera
moves down to under the bed where we expect CHARLES to be
There seems to be nowhere else in the room where he could
fit

Finally he emerges from a suitcase as behind him the
couple are having sex He crawls towards a dressing table
which has little curtains under it He crawls between them
- at last he is protected He looks at his watch This
could be a long haul

CHARLES goes on eating and talking

CHARLES

Its a novel idea isnt it - sending
wedding invites to people you dont
know Dear Greg Thanks very much
for your totally charming
invitation Unfortunately Ive
never fucking heard of you or your
daughter Judith so I fear I shant
be attending Christ - what a
cheek - theyve even put in a

SCARLETT
Second name Caroline

full of ceramic tigers exotic carpets woven baskets
beautiful silks wooden carvings He approaches an

shirt and sneakers dont fit in with the spirit of the

CHARLES
Hello Im here to maybe buy

beautiful things about the £1000
mark
CHARLES

Yes I was thinking about something
more like well 50

ASSISTANT
So youd like to buy tthree knives
and a fork

CHARLES
Thats what I get for 50 quid

ASSISTANT
Yes for £51 you get two knives and
two forks - but we dont want to

smash through your budget barrier
Or you could have that ceramic
leopard over there

CHARLES
Ah excellent thats more like it
ASSISTANT
If you can find someone to chip in
£11950
CHARLES smiles
ASSISTANT

Or our carrier bags are £150 - you
could just get 33 of them

CHARLES
Actually I think Ill leave it
Thanks very much Youve been very
helpful

He turns and bumps straight into CARRIE Shes just in
jeans and a white t-shirt her hair down very different
much plainer but still in her way lovely Shes ina
very good mood

CARRIE

CHARLES
Nothing yet - just deciding

CARRIE
Its so great this I should have

CARRIE
O no - just get me a knife and fork

CHARLES
Surely - Ive got to meet my brother

decision to make

As they walk away
CARRIE (V0)

Ive waited all my life for this
particular shopping experience

72 INT STORE CHANGING ROOM DAY 72

CARRIE (V0)

All right - now the most important
thing is that you mustnt laugh

CHARLES
Okay

She emerges in a plain formal typical WEDDING DRESS
She is despite herself quite shy about it

CARRIE
What do you think

He looks at her and then laughs gentlyas if theres any
question
CHARLES
Divine

CARRIE
Okay - thats a start - lets go

Music starts - you can guess the style of the wedding dress
from the dialogue

CARRIE emerges again

CHARLES
Gorgeousnot quite my style
CARRIE
Meringue
CHARLES
Rather
keKK

CARRIE in a white satin hot pants suit

CHARLES
Youre kidding

CARRIE
But it would be great wouldnt it

CHARLES
If I were your husband I would die
of pride

CARRIE
Yeh I think Hamish would die full
stop

kkk

She emerges again

CHARLES
Thats it - perfect - sexy and yet
traditional

CARRIE

Its the petticoat

CHARLES
Ah

kkeik

She walks out - its a little bo-peep type - lots of lace
and silk bows

CARRIE
This is the dress What do you
think

CHARLES
Ahm

CARRIE

I knew it - I knew it -
She goes back in

CHARLES
But if you can get a little staff it
would be very good for looking after
sheep

CARRIE (V0)
Dont be rude A lot of people have
been very happy in that dress

keke

She comes out in bra and pants and poses for a split second

like a fifties model
CARRIE
And then theres always the beach
look

And runs straight back in again

CHARLES
Its no wonder husbands arent
allowed to see this - they would
realise they were not worthy
kkEK
CARRIE (V0O)

Right - ignore the dress - its
trains were talking about now
What do we think

cut To

CARRIE is standing at the door of the store - the train

stretches right back into the changing room - 30 feet

CHARLES
You look mad

kkee

CARRIE (VO) ©
Second to last I think it might be
a bit sexy

She emerges in a silver-sequined full length sheath
staggering she looks like a mermaid It is divinity

CHARLES
Im speechiess
CARRIE
Yeh - I kind of figured
CHARLES
I mean I adore it - but theres

nothing in the world more off-
putting at a wedding than a priest
with an enormous erection

keke

CARRIE (V0O)
ok and finally kind of
traditional but kind of nice

She comes out - it is beautiful - for the first time she is
wearing a veil CHARLES is silent She lifts the veil
slowly It is a magical moment Beyond comment

73 INT TEA ROOM DAY 73

Its polite and old-fashioned On the table in front of
CHARLES and CARRIE is a pot of tea and a slice of
Battenburg cake Outside it is pouring with rain

CHARLES
Do you mind the fact that its
always raining in England

CARRIE
I love it - when we were young and
it rained my Dad always took us out
in big yellow coats with no
umbrellas and wed fool around till
the rain stopped - so for my family
rains a happy thing

CHARLES
Thats a sickeningly wholesome story
- what did your Dad do when it was
sunny

CARRIE
He locked us in the basement and
-beat us with sticks

CHARLES laughs During the scene they are both eating the
slice of cake - but neither will finish it At first this
is quite reasonable - they each take little pieces with
their forks leaving enough for the other But finally
theyre actually dividing the crumbs

CHARLES
One really strange thing is thinking
youll never sleep with anyone else
You dont think youll ever be
unfaithful

CARRIE
No - not once were married - Ive
told Hamish Ill kill him if he is -
so I think I better stick by that

CHARLES
Quite right Although just before
he died John Betjeman was asked if
he had any regrets in life and he
said he wished hed slept around
more

CARRIE
No - I reckon Ive had a fair run at
it

CHARLES

How many is a fair run these days
CARRIE

Oo I dont know more than one
CHARLES

Like - how many Ive seen the

dress - I can take anything now

CARRIE
Well

At first shes unwilling but then she gets drawn
counting them out on her fingers

CARRIE (cont)
Okay - lets see Right - 1 - not
easily forgotten Kind of nice 2
- mistake hairy back 3 - lovely
getting into the swing of it now 4
5 6 that was my birthday present

CHARLES

the country - endless fooling around
in barns Then there was 7 - yummy
- 8 - yummy yummy - 9 - against a
fence - really uncomfortable —- dont

CHARLES

CARRIE
Then 10 ah 10 - he was the really
annoying one we all have when you
say o no why didnt I know all
this stuff before - I wasted one
to nine 11 - obviously in the
circumstances very disappointing

CHARLES

mouths

74

CARRIE (cont)

12 - still recovering 13 - 0 so
theres even more to it 14 15 16
17 - the University years - lovely
intelligent sensitive boys -
sexually speaking a real low patch
18 - he broke my heart Long years
of yearning

CHARLES
Im sorry

CARRIE
After which came 19 - who I dont
remember but my room-mate said we
definitely did it - 20 - long one -
3 years 21 - my Fatal Attraction

CHARLES
He went crazy

CARRIE

No he looked like Michael Douglas
22 - that was my first year in
England - I love English guys - 23
and 24 together which was
something

CHARLES
Youre joking

CARRIE
No it was a holiday I was brown
they were foreign sure beat

conversation and were still ages
before AIDS 25 - gorgeous - older
man 26 - dreadful - older man 27
- that was a mistake

CHARLES
Suddenly at 27 you make a mistake
CARRIE
He had a really bad cold I thought
it wouldnt matter - it did
Actually there are a few nasty ones
round here - lots of rather grand

Frenchman I thought were glamorous
Very nearly gave up on the whole
thing But Spencer changed my mind
thats 28 His father - 29

HIS FATHER

CARRIE (cont)
Then 30 - he shouted a lot which I
found odd 31 - fine 32 — lovely
And my fiancee - 33

CHARLES
So I came after your fiancee
CARRIE
No you were 32
CHARLES
O thank you
CARRIE

So there we have it - something to
tell my daughters Now what about

you
CHARLES
(panic) Me
CARRIE
Yes - how many girls have you slept
with
CHARLES

O God ahm well nothing like that
many I dont know what the fuck
Ive been doing with my time
actually Work probably - thats
it Work

CARRIE
Well go on

CHARLES
Ahm well lets see -

He counts on his fingers - 123 Pause 4th finger Long
pause

CHARLES
o it must be about twenty

CARRIE
No go on try harder

CHARLES
(He just cant come up with the
numbers) Five six all right
about 15

CARRIE

My husband says hes slept with 384

CHARLES
Thats a lie - hes lying Hes a
filthy liar

CARRIE
Apparently not He was very perky
in his 30s

CHARLES
Was he 0 God Ive wasted my
life Here I am having tea when I
should be out scouring the streets
Look do you mind if I pay n run
Ive got serious shagging to do

She laughs Both of them just stop talking CHARLES
watches her sipping her tea and smiles Somethings
happened She has a bite of cake - then looks at hin
calmly - he snaps out of it

CHARLES
Sorry - Sorry (Pause) I wish Id
rung you (She smiles) But then you
didnt ring me either You
ruthlessly slept with me twice and
then never rang me

CARRIE
(gentler) Thats another strange
thing about getting married - you
look back on all the people youve
been with andyou get sentimental
about them and you think about
other decisions you night have made

They look at each other Pause She decides to break it
---Who knows maybe I should have given
the guy with the hairy back another chance -
there are creams

They both laugh These are two people who should be
together

CARRIE
I have to go soon
CHARLES
QO Christ - (looks at his watch) -

come with me - be my excuse

CHARLES
Good lord

before him is an extraordinary sight

The entire Hall has been transformed into a Medieval
Scottish World of roasting animals and burning braziers -
strange tableaux of scenes from Scottish history threaten
in the corners

In the corner are a Scottish band ali ready to suggest that
the people spend the evening dancing reels

cut TO

The friends - as in the first wedding gathered to survey
the scene GARETH at his most exuberant

GARETH
What can one say - its sodding
Macbeth

SCARLETT

Do you think those deer are real
FIONA closes her eyes at this

GARETH
Dearest things - Ive decided to set
you all a challenge as you know
there is at the moment not a wedding
ring between the lot of us - which
is particularly disappointing in the
case of the heterosexuals here
present -
TOM

Well dont look at me Ive asked
hundreds of people (He points out
various girls) Ive asked her and
her I asked her twice - and her
sister

SCARLETT
You havent asked me

TOM
Havent I

SCARLETT
No

TOM
Well yes I mean of course
Scarlett would you likeyou

TOM (contd)
knowI havent got much to offer

but erm
SCARLETT
No thanks Tom But nice of you to
ask
TOM

No any time

GARETH

Be that as it may - I want to set
you a challenge - find husbands and
wives Weddings are the ideal time
for it Matthew and I are in a
slightly special position and we
will try to entertain the Americans
- but the rest of you - please -
conjugate Id like to go to the
wedding of someone I really loved
for a change

TOM
Fair enough - Im game What about
you Fifi - spot a potential hubby in
the throng

FIONA
Fuck off Tom

TOM
Quite right

SCARLETT
Im game I can see 4 or 5

candidates
A champagne tray comes round

j GARETH

A toast before we head into battle -
to true love in whatever shape or
form it comes May all of us in our

dotage be proud to say I was
adored once too

ALL
True love
GARETH
Right - as David Bowie said so
brilliantly before he went
completely off the rails - Lets

dance

GARETH rubs his hands in glee - hes going to misbehave -
we can see that MATTHEW actually loves this in hin

DAVID

You presumably wont be pursuing
this with particular relish

CHARLES

No I think Ill just sit here and
wait for my wife to find me

DAVID raises an eyebrow and walks away - CHARLES sits down
on his own near a large stuffed warrior A voice comes
from behind him

HENRIETTA
Hello Charles

CHARLES
O Hen no please - I couldnt bear
a scene today I know Im a total
shite I deserve repeated torture

HENRIETTA
Did I behave that atrociously last
time

CHARLES

Do you remember when we were on holiday
in the Caribbean and I got attacked by that
enormous stingray

HENRIETTA
Yes

CHARLES
It was worse

She laughs She is in a good playful mood - you can now
see why they might have once gone out - they are
comfortable as old boyfriend and girlfriend

CHARLES
Christ Im depressed how are you

HENRIETTA
Well cheerful actually - Ive got
a divine new boyfriend who is over
there (cutaway to her good looking
boyfriend) and I weigh almost

nothing

CHARLES
Yes you look wonderful Perhaps
you were right Hen - perhaps we

should have got married
HENRIETTA
Absolutely not - youll never marry
anyone Charles What you are is a
serial monogamist kind and lovely -
but always in transit

CHARLES
Im sure I could change right girl
right railway station

HENRIETTA
And besides - marry you and you have
to marry your friends - and Im not
sure I could take Fiona

CHARLES
Fiona loves you
HENRIETTA
Fiona calls me the Attractive
Duck
CHARLES
Does she So all round - Im not a
good bet
HENRIETTA
No - nice for a year but
CHARLES
Thanks for that Hen - I was

depressed but youve really cheered
me up I think Ill go die now

HENRIETTA
Please come and have lunch sometime
- ring me (pecks him gently on
the cheek) Still cute

CHARLES looks up at GARETH - who shrugs his shoulders - he

knows Charless secret

CARRIE and HAMISH are at the end on a sort of raised

platform

CARRIE
Thank you Forgive me if Im a
- little hesitant - the last really
important speech I made was to my
mother and father explaining exactly
what a packet of condoms were doing
in my bedside table

LAUGHTER
CARRIE (cont)

I really only want to say 3 things
The first is how overjoyed I am to
see all of you here - I would have
thought that not living in the same
country was a perfect excuse for not
turning up to a wedding - and yet
here you Americans are Thank you
And as for the locals - I would have
thought the fact that lots of
frightful Americans were flying in
was the perfect excuse for staying
away — so thank you too

CHARLES looks at her with affection

CARRIE (cont)

Point number 2 is a private thing
between me and my sister - I always
told you Id tell you on my wedding
day - and the answer is - yes I did
- 3 times - and Im really sorry

The third point is the important one
- if my darling Dad had been here
today he would have been speaking
now -— and I know what he would have
said - cute dress babe but why
the hell are you marrying the stiff
in the skirt

TOM roars with laughter - hes very impressed at her cheek

CARRIE (cont)
And I would have given him the same

answer I give you - ‘because I love
him As John Lennon who died the
same year as my Dad said - Love is

the answer - and you know that for
sure I do know - and Im sure

They all clap as she sits down CHARLES cant believe he
let her go

CHARLES

This is the last wedding Im going
to - I mean it

DAVID quietly pats his brothers shoulder

Now the

applause dies down and CARRIE just gets to her feet again

CARRIE
O final thing - someone here asked
me to marry them last week and the
answer is - ‘yeh okay if this
doesnt work out

Its an outrageous thing to say and HAMISH roars with

laughter CHARLES looks at her

FREDERICK - THE BEST MAN
Splendid And now my Lords Ladies
and gents my dear friend and yours
Mr Hamish Banks

CHARLES shakes his head in dismay HAMISH is
confident in his years and social position
DAVID
Imean how old is he 2000 3000
years o1d
HAMISH

Anyone involved in Conservative

snooth

politics over the past 20 years has -

got used to being upstaged by a
woman But I didnt expect it to
happen on my wedding day’ That
said it couldnt have been done by
a more wonderful woman one by whon
I am quite happy to be upstaged for
the rest of my life

Loud Bravo In the background there is a

Everyone laughs

80 SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE DRAWING ROOM NIGHT 80

This is the room they have moved Gareth to It is huge and

SCARLETT sprints inelegeantly into the room runs towards
them and slips across the polished wooden floor like on
ice

83INT SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE RECEPTION NIGHT 83
We see CHARLES his face white walking through the crowds
of people laughing HAMISH still talking in the
background

HAMISH

I looked in the mirror this morning
when I was shaving and I thought to
myself - I must learn to shave
without looking in the mirror
However - if as the years go by I
can look in the mirror and see my
beautiful bride behind me - then
Ill put up with anything

reaches him he hesitates - its a hard moment

There in the middle of the mountains stands a rough stone
chapel Outside it are parked lots of cars CHARLES is
last again SCARLETT and he both get out and walk swiftly
SCARLETT is dressed all in black except for pink shoes

CHARLES
Sorry Im

DAVID
Dont worry We told you the wrong
time It starts in ten minutes

Youre early

CHARLES
Thanks Tom Good to see you

TOM
Wonderful to see you Charles as
always Darling Scarlett

SCARLETTs face just creases with sorrow TOM seems to
have changed into a slightly different figure still
foolish but a good member of the community

88 INT FUNERAL CHURCH LAKE DISTRICT DAY 88
They all walk in together CHARLES sees MATTHEW

CHARLES
Im sorry Im late

MATTHEW
Not at all - Gareth would have been
deeply wounded if youd broken a
lifetimes tradition

CHARLES moves past many faces we recognise ANGUS LYDIA
BERNARD LAURA and more We also see some older people
University colleagues - and two slightly meek older
people understood to be Gareths parents

CHARLES sees that CARRIE is there in the far corner of the
church She looks plain un-made up - a beautiful but
rather startling contrast to the high flush of her wedding
day But CHARLES sits where TOM gently guides him next to
FIONA DAVID slips in next to him

Music begins to play The service begins The coffin is
there in the middle of the aisle The music comes to an
end The local PRIEST speaks

PRIEST
Before I begin I have asked Matthew
to say a few words

MATTHEW steps forward He has a few papers

MATTHEW
Gareth used to prefer funerals to
weddings He said it was easier to
get enthusiastic about a ceremony
one at least had an outside chance
of eventually being involved in

Everyone laughs they are immediately at ease CHARLES
discreetly signs MATTHEWS words for DAVID

In order to do my research for this
speech I rang round to get a general
picture of how Gareth was regarded
by those who met him Fat seems
to be a word people most connected

with him I rang a couple of
libraries and asked if they
remembered him No - He was
fat - O yes of course

Terribly rude also rang a lot of
bells When I told the emotional
Italian in our local sandwich shop
that Gareth was dead his first
reaction was Thank God for that -
before of course bursting into
tears and closing the shop to mourn
So very rude and very fat seems
to have been the strangers
viewpoint And Im sure the maker
of his waistcoats would like me to
add very demanding and of course
quite mad

On the other hand some of you have
been kind enough to ring me and

MATTHEW (contd)

tell me that you loved him which
I know he would have been thrilled
to hear Your remember his fabulous
hospitality and his strange
experimental cooking - the recipe
for Duck a la Banana fortunately
goes with him to his grave Most of
all you tell me of his enormous
capacity for joy and when joyful
for highly vocal drunkenness His
full bass version of Shaddupa Ya
Face is something we will all
tragically never forget But I
hope joyful is how you will remember
hin Not stuck in a box in a
church Pick your favourite of his
waistcoats and then remember him
that way the most splendid
replete gaudily dressed weak-
hearted as it turned out and jolly
bugger most of us ever met

As for me you may ask how I will
remember him what I thought of hin
and unfortunately there I fall
rather short of words Perhaps
youll forgive me if I turn for ny
own feelings to the words of another
splendid bugger WHAuden

He recites a poem by Auden At first he modestly reads it
and then looks up and speaks it not consulting the paper
in front of him Cut aways during the poem should include
GARETHS parents - it would be nice to feel they understand
MATTHEW

This is actually what I want to say

Stop all the clocks cut off the telephone
Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone
Silence the pianos and with muffled drum

Bring out the coffin let the mourners come

Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead

Scribbling on the sky the message He is Dead

Put the crepe bows round the white necks of the public
doves

Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves

He was my North my South my East and West

My working week and my Sunday rest

My noon my midnight my talk my song

I thought that love would last for ever I was wrong

The stars are not wanted now put out every one

MATTHEW (contd)
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood
For nothing now can ever come to any good

A long silence as MATTHEW folds his piece of paper As he
goes and sits down a little child cries out fed up

MATTHEW
Quite right

CUT TO FIONA reading the lesson

FIONA

If I speak with the tongues of men
and angels but have not love I an
become a sounding brass or a
clanging cymbal And if I have the
gift of prophecy and know all
mysteries and all knowledge and if
I have all faith so as to remove
mountains but have not love I am
nothing

CUT TO CHARLES translating the last sentence for DAVID
They both know how true it is

89 EXT FUNERAL CHURCH LAKE DISTRICT DAY 89

CHARLES nods As SCARLETT walks away she comes across
FIONA who puts her arm over SCARLETTS shoulder Then
SCARLETT slips an arm round FIONAS waist It is the first
time weve seen them affectionate

CARRIE approaches CHARLES
CHARLES
It was good of you to come - must
have been the shortest honeymoon in
history
CARRIE
No its fine Were going to take
it some other time
Pause there are things to say

That thing you said in the street

CHARLES
Im sorry about that - it was the
tea tea always - its like LSD
with me I dont know what Im
doing

CARRIE
No - I liked it I liked you saying
it

CHARLES

Well likewise your speech - Ill
hold you to it

CARRIE
Okay

Long pause
Id better be going

CHARLES
Yes Bye

He puts out his hand - to shake - but she comes forward and
kisses him - it is awkward like two uncomfortable lovers
Then she walks away

FIONA
Walk Charlie

CHARLES
Yes That would be lovely

90 EXT NEAR FUNERAL CHURCH LAKE DISTRICT DAY 90
FIONA and CHARLES are overlooking the hills

FIONA
You like that girl dont you
CHARLES
Yes - yes its a strange thing

when at last it happens

He looks at her with truth without irony - then shakes
his head

What about you Fifi - when are you
going to show your cards

FIONA
O really theyre there for all to
see Ive been in love with the

same bloke for ages
CHARLES
Whos that
Pause
FIONA
(Very casually) You Charles Its
always been you since first we met
oO so many years ago

He is sad perplexed She takes a puff on her cigarette

FIONA
I knew the firstmoment Across the
crowded room - or lawn in fact

Pause for another puff

Doesnt matter Nothing either of
us can do on this one Such is
life

She looks straight at him Shes calm glad to have said
it He looks out still confused Then turns and looks at

her thoughtfully - she is calmly surveying the scene ahead
Pause

FIONA
Friends isnt bad you’ know
Friends is quite something

CHARLES
YesSo what do we do Let our
parents decide who we should marry
Take the first girl and boy coming
over the hill

FIONA
No but perhaps you know change
the goalposts - look for something
different - look for someone we can
live with rather than someone we

adore

TOM
Hello you chaps Not butting in am
I

FIONA

(Almost tenderly) No come on Ton
They get up and begin to stride

TOM
Gosh that was some display wasnt
it - never felt like that - I mean
something vaguely similar for Jilly
when I was young

CHARLES looks for explanation FIONA explains

FIONA
Labrador

TOM
In a way I think its hardest for
the parents dont you I hope I
die before my children

CHARLES
Tom - one thing I find really
touching is your total confidence
you will get married What if you
‘ never find the right girl

TOM

Well I dont know Charlie truth is

- unlike you Ive never expected

the thunderbolt - always hoped Id
just meet some nice friendly girl

like the look of her hope the look

of me doesnt make her physically

sick - then pop the question and
settle down and be happy

CHARLES and FIONA exchange a look - maybe hes right

It worked for my parentswell
apart from the divorce and all that

CHARLES

Dear Tom youre very wise I give
you six months at the outside
Dont want the responsibilities of
Best Man but can I be chief usher

TOM

Dear fellow That would be
splendid

And as they walk on

Bravo Fine turn of phrase

MATTHEW
But here amongst friends Im sure
wed all agree that its time for a
little more honesty

CHARLES
Shame

MATTHEW
I for one had totally given up on
Charles getting married I thought
the only way for him ever tying
the knot would be to team up with
some equally desperate ex and make
the best of a bad job

CHARLES
Your honour I object

MATTHEW
Either that - or hed marry someone
for their looks and accept the fact
that hes basically married to us
lot - the only problem being we
refuse to have his babies

TOM
I dont know about that

MATTHEW
And the truth of the matter is -
hes gone and done both - settled
for some desperately attractive
desperate ex

Bugger

After each bugger cut to another slightly surprised
looking religious icon - The Virgin Mary The Crucifix and
a final one which should be exceptionally angry
disapproving or is a man being pricked by forks in hell

CHARLES
Bugger

A very sweet-natured verger pops his head out from behind
a curtain where he has been washing his hands

VERGER

MATTHEW
(totally calm)
Ah Charles good to see you

CHARLES

Hello Matthew What was the name of
that low budget sci-fi film 1980s
where the hero had a watch which
sort of slowed down time - so he
could run around at real speed
while everyone else was in slow
motion

MATTHEW
O yes I remember Damn - yes
Good film

CHARLES
Very good film

MATTHEW
Not The Hidden

CHARLES
No One word titleTrancers

in the congregation and theyve
been stuck next to the damn flowers

congregation not the flowers - but
anyway with any luck it will be
all right in a jiffy Im absolutely
convinced Ill report back

He rushes back into the Church HENRIETTA raises her eyes
sceptically - this chaos is rather what she expected of

Toms ushering

110 INT WEDDING 4 CHURCH DAY

TOM reaches MATTHEW and DAVID
MATTHEW
How are you doing

fear
MATTHEW
(calling out)
Hello

The VICAR enters

VICAR
Hello Thought Id come in and
shove on the gear You chaps having
a final smoke are you before the
proceedings

MATTHEW
Yes sort of spiritually speaking

VICAR
Well dont be too long - the
bridell think you dont want to
marry her

They exchange glances - at the last moment defeated by
politeness and etiquette The VICAR talks away while
CHARLES signs to DAVID

VICAR (VO CHARLES and DAVIDs conversation)
Seeing you all in here reminds me of
a terrible time I had a groom who
had rather overdone it with the
alcohol the day before and found he
couldnt help throwing up into the
font Problem was no-one knew and
the next Saturday someone rather
carelessly filled it up with water
for a Christening without checking
inside No wonder the poor blighter
cried when he got dunked

What were watching is CHARLES talking to DAVID

DAVID
Give mean update

CHARLES
This is so embarrassing

DAVID
Iwas with you the day you wet
yourself during the school Carol

service

CHARLES
z just saw Carrie and shes
separated and it suddenly reminded
me

DAVID
QO Jesus Charlie its your wedding
day

CHARLES
IknowWhats your advice

DAVID
3 choices go ahead with it

CHARLES

DAVID

Go outside and say folks bad news

113 INT WEDDING 4 CHURCH DAY 113

CHARLES walks along to the top of the aisle with MATTHEW
Meanwhile at the back

SCARLETT
What was that about

TOM
Buggered if I know

As CHARLES looks forward the light breaks through the
stained glass windows on to CARRIE He looks at her and
walks on up the aisle to his fate

MATTHEW checks in his pocket for the rings He pretends to
have lost them - them remembers theyre in his back pocket
with a great show of mock relief He turns TOM is at the
front door and gives him a thumbs up - everything is AOK
for action

The Wedding march starts

CUT TO HENRIETTA walking down the aisle - she looks
beautiful Her father by her side holding her arn

HENRIETTA
Not so tight

She arrives The PRIEST steps forward CHARLES smiles at
hin

VICAR
Dearly beloved We are gathered
here together in the sight of God
and in the face of this congregation
to join together this man and this
woman in holy-Matrimony -

CUT TO SCARLETT absolutely totally beaming with pride - and
probably crying already

VICAR (contd)
which is an honourable estate
instituted of God in the time of
mans innocence signifying unto us
the mystical union that is betwixt
Christ and his Church

CUT TO ANGUS and LAURA

and therefore is not by any to be
enterprised nor taken in hand
unadvisedly lightly or wantonly

CUT TO BERNARD and LYDIA

But reverently discreetly
advisedly soberly and in the fear
of God Therefore if any man can
show any just cause why they may not
lawfully be joined together let him
speak now or else hereafter for
ever hold his peace

The usual pause Settle on CHARLES And then there is a
knocking from behind knuckles on wood

CHARLES looks startled The BRIDE looks to him alarmed
So does MATTHEW

cuT TO DAVID
CHARLES

VICAR
Im sorry - does someone have
something to say

who raises his hand CUT between him and

CHARLES
I think he might (He starts to
sign) What in the name of

DAVID
Ithought of a third option

CHARLES
What

DAVID
Will you translate

CHARLES
Translate what

VICAR
Whats going on

CHARLES

Ahn hes asking me if Ill
translate what hes saying

VICAR
O excellent What is he saying

CHARLES
He says( and he watches David)
‘I suspect the groom is having doubts I
suspect the groom would like to delay I
suspect the groom I suspect the groom

DAVID

-really loves someone else
Thats the truth isnt it Charlie

CHARLES doesnt sign back

DAVID (cont)
Because Charlie this is for the
rest of your life - in the end if
you marry at all - youve got to
marry the person you totally love

CUT TO CHARLES and then DAVID again

DAVID (cont)

And by the way - your flies are
undone

CHARLES just does a tiny look down

VICAR
Whats he saying

CHARLES
He says he suspects that the groom
loves someone else

VICAR

someone else (Pause) ‘Do you
