Debbie gets out of the shower Pete follows

PETE
Whats the matter

DEBBIE
You just took a Viagra to have sex
with me

PETE
I thought it would make it better
It was better It takes some of the
pressure off

DEBBIE
Because you cant get hard without
a Viagra Is it because you dont
think Im sexy

for me to supersize it for once

DEBBIE
That is the worst birthday present
you could ever give someone

everything the other person says
just annoys the shit out of each
other All the time Its a blast

BARRY
Dont worry about it You just
gotta ride that out

PETE
This sounds terrible but do you
ever wonder what it would be like
if say you were separated by
something bigger like death Like
her death

BARRY
I have given it a fair amount of
thought

PETE
Not in a painful way Just quietly
slid into death Like a gas leak

BARRY
Absolutely It has got to be
peaceful I mean this is the mother
of your children

Im contextualizing him as one of
the great figures in rock history

RONNIE
You cant show him in his prime in
“77 and then jump straight to him
as he is now Its terrifying You
have to reverse it Youve got to
show him as he is now very briefly
and then show him in 1977 You have
to Benjamin Button it

CAT
I dont know what youre talking
about okay All rock stars are
older now Steven Tyler David
Bowie Mick Jagger--

PETE
Paul McCartney

RONNIE
Okay stop it Everybody youre
mentioning looks like an old woman

now

LARRY
Am I doing what I didnt start the

guilt from all the abandonment
issues

DEBBIE
You cant buy forgiveness right
Pete

PETE
I dont think anyones looking for
handouts Wed pay him back

OLIVER
If you two are in a bind Id be
more than happy to help
