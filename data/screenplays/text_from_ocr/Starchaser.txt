The Legend of Orin

FINAL DRAFT
“STARCHASER THE LEGEND OF ORIN”

INT MINEWORLD - BLACKNESS

Sounds grow louder until we hear a mixture of picks on rocks
electronic spitting and pneumatic pounding There is also
the sound of human suffering

An pulsating reddish glow begins to shimmer over the
blackness revealing the rock of the mine walls peppered
with sparkling red crystals

WIDEN to take in the incredible vastness of the slave mines
of Trinia Ragged sweating men and women pound picks into
the rock walls blast away rock with laser-drills shovel
glowing red crystals into endless chains of ore cars

An exhausted slave falls to his knees exhausted A MINE-
MASTER with metallic armor that makes it hard to determine
whether he is human or robot cracks his searing laser-whip
across the mans back The slave buckles in pain

MINE-MASTER
Get up and dig worm

Another slave ORIN reacts to the mine-masters injustice
He grips his drill tightly The look on his face says hed
like to ram it into the mine-masters back He hesitates
just long enough to let his anger settle as the exhausted
slave creaks to his feet continues his work

Orin angrily grinds a laser-drill into the crystal laden
rock He is a thin yet muscular nineteen year old whose
incessant years of mining have made him a man before his
time His pale skin golden hair and blue eyes contrast the
dimness of the mine

Alongside Orin an old man HOPPS picks away at the rock
with feeble strokes He looks to be in his seventies with
white hair and ribs with too little meat His young
seventeen year old granddaughter ELAN is beside him her
strong arms swinging a pick with skill that contrasts her
beauty Hopps stops to wipe the burning sweat from his eyes

ELAN
Youve got to slow down grandfather
Youre too old to keep up this pace

HOPPS
Ive been digging for seventy years
Elan Slowing down will only prolong
my suffering

He raises his pick hammers harder at the rock wall Orin
moves quietly behind Hopps smiles at Elan then dumps his
bucket of crystals into the old mans ore bucket filling it

ELAN
(whispering)
Orin dont You wont survive doing
the work of two

ORIN
For the prettiest girl in the world Id
do the work of ten

Elan smiles warmly at Orin touches his cheek There is a
sudden crack of a laser-whip

MINE-MASTER
No talking The gods forbid it

As Orin and Elan continue their digging cut to

INT MINEWORLD - ADJACENT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

A small boy gropes along bucket of water in one hand the
other feeling the rock wall He is KALLIE Orins younger
brother of nine Although he appears to know his way about
he is blind the scar of a mine-masters whip angled across
his face

KALLIE
Water Water

Kallie stops as he senses the hands of a slave on the bucket
splashing a cupful of water over his parched lips quickly
getting back to work as the angry eyes of a mine-master
watch Kallie moves along

There is a sudden shudder The miners protect themselves as
rocks begin to fall A piece of the mine ceiling collapses
on a teenage boy leaving only his legs visible His mother
drops to her knees beside them tries futilely to pull him
free sobbing A mine-master whips her

MINE-MASTER
Leave him be Hes no use to anyone
now
Kallie stumbles into the mine-master who kicks him down
Orin swings his laser drill around to defend his little

brother The mine-master coils his laser whip around it
struggling with Orin who pulls him down He’s about to

strike him when another mine-master coils his whip around
Orin’s neck yanks him back

KALLIE
Orin

The mine-master is about to kill Orin stopped by loud
electronic gong Miners put down their equipment and move
away Kallie gropes about and finds Orin

KALLIE (CONTD)
Orin

INT MINEWORLD - FURNACE OF LIFE - CONTINUOUS

Hundreds of slaves stretching into the distance gather at
the edge of a deep abyss with flowing lava at the bottom On
the other side is a giant scowling stone face carved into the
rock wall The slaves bow toward it and begin to chant the
name “Zygon”

The furnace’s mouth opens radiating a fiery glow like the
gates of hell

Orin stands fast looking off at the other cowed slaves a
look of rebellion in his eyes The mine-master pushes him
hard to his knees

MINE-MASTER
On your knees

The flaming mouth of the Furnace of Life opens wide and out
of its glowing interior emerges a towering man wearing a
long black cape and hideous horned mask

SLAVES
(frightened whispers)
Zygon Zygon

ZYGON

(calm but intense)
The Gods of the Mineworld are angry
They have kept you alive since the
beginning of time and ask very little
in return But again the Furnace of
Life cries out in hunger You must
feed it more crystals or its life-
giving energy will burn out forever
So dig harderor die

Zygon turns walking back into the flaming mouth

A large container of crystal ore extends out over the lava
cavern and into the flaming mouth A moment later it
returns filled with small bundles of food A mine-master
cracks his whip

MINE-MASTER
Pick up your gifts and get back to
work

The slaves rush madly for the food fighting each other like
animals Orin gets into a tug-o’-war as another man tries to
steal his bundle Another slave breaks up the fight Orin
moves off with his bundle

DISSOLVE TO

INT MINEWORLD - DRIFT TUNNEL - LATER

Kallie eats as Orin continues to drill at the rock His
drill strikes something and flashes knocking him down

Orin spots something glowing pries away at the rock
exposing a golden jewel-encrusted hilt He grasps it and
pulls up a fabulous sword Hopps reacts with recognition

HOPPS
(awed gasp)

Oh my god
ORIN

Whats wrong Hopps

HOPPS
I thought it was only a myth

Kallie tugs on Orins shirt

KALLIE
Remember what the mine-master said
Were supposed to give them anything

Hopps clamps his hand over Kallies mouth

HOPPS
Not a word They must not get this

ORIN
What is it

They hear someone approaching
HOPPS
(to Orin urgent)

Hide it

Orin hides the sword in the food bundle as a mine-master
strides up

MINE-MASTER
Why arent you working

Before the mine-master can see what Orin has Hopps raises
his pick swinging it with wild rage

HOPPS
(shouting crazed)
No no noooo

The mine-master lashes out with his laser-whip It coils
around Hopp’s head He drops his pick grabs his eyes and
collapses

HOPPS (CONTD)
(screaming)
My eyes

MINE-MASTER
Madman

As the mine-master exits Orin and Elan move to Hopps
HOPPS
(dying)
The sword Thesword

(points up)
Up there

Then he dies in Elans arms
ELAN
(crying)
Grandfather why -- Hes gone I have
no one now
ORIN
(hugs her)
You have me

DISSOLVE TO

INT MINEWORLD - SLEEPING AREA
Orin is seated on a rock with Elan trying to comfort her

ELAN
He died for no reason Orin

ORIN
No Elan Hopps sacrificed his life
for us

ELAN
But why

ORIN

I dont know But whatever Hopps was
trying to tell us had something to do
with this

Orin withdraws the sword from the food bundle It suddenly
begins to shimmer Other slaves watch in awe as the sword
flips into the air and jams into the ground

The glowing image of a saintly old man with white hair and
beard materializes

SLAVE 1
Its alive

KHA-KHAN

(filtered echo)
If in the distant future someone
hears these words perhaps it is not
too late By now you will have been
slaving in the mines for more than a
thousand years Take heed These dark
corridors are not your true home
There is a world above A magnificent
universe to which you can return if you
have the courage He who possesses
this sword possesses the power of
truth Find the blade and you will
find your freedom

The man fades away Then the blade glows and vanishes The
golden hilt drops to the mine floor Orin and the others
look at one another in disbelief fear and wonder

SLAVES
(awed whispers)
He’s gone A world above Freedom

RAYMO a scar-faced slave scoffs at the others

RAYMO
Lies All lies

ORIN

But why would anyone lie about an upper
world Raymo

RAYMO
Bah By believing the words of that
demon you spit on the most sacred
commandment
(points up)
Never dig up Up is hell

ORIN
What if the commandments are wrong
What if there is a world beyond our
own By not trying to find it we could
spend the rest of eternity digging and
dying when there may besomething
else

RAYMO
What else could there be

ELAN
I dont know but on my grandfathers
grave I swear if there is a world
above I will find it Who’s with me

RAYMO
No ones going with you Im turning
you both in to the mine-masters for
speaking out against the gods
(lunges for hilt)
Now give me that piece of dirt

They struggles as Raymo tries to wrest the hilt from Orin
He grabs a rock about to smash his skull but Orin knocks
him out with a blow from the hilt

KALLIE
(frightened)
Orin

ORIN
Im alright Kallie

SLAVE 1
If Raymo tells the mine-masters you
will be killed Orin

ORIN
In that case I might as well die trying
to find the upper world Well go
together Elan

KALLIE
Ill go with you too

Orin puts a hands on Kallies shoulders kneels before him

ORIN
Youll have to be with us in spirit
Kallie Its too dangerous for one as
young as you

KALLIE
Im not too young You dont want me
because I cant see Dont leave me
Orin Ill die without you

ORIN

Youll do just fine
(looks to Aunt Bella)
Aunt Bella will look after you

KALLIE
(crying)
But what if youdont come back

ORIN
Ill come back Kallie I promise
(hugs Kallie)
I love you little digger

masters

KALLIE a short distance away gropes the rocks following
them carrying a food bundle

KALLIE
You forgot the food

MINE-MASTER (VO)
Hey you Why aren’t you working

ORIN
Quick Get into the ore car Hurry

The three of them climb into the slowly moving ore train

The mine masters climb onto the last car They move from car
to car until they reach Orin start to whip him He snags
one of their laser whips with his drill yanks him out of the
car As he attacks the second mine-master Elan grabs
Kallie helps him out of the car

ORIN (CONTD)
Run Kallie run

Orin blasts the other mine master then jumps out of the car

MINE-MASTER
Stop

As Kallie staggers off in one direction Orin and Elan move
the other way As they reach

THE ORE CAR TERMINAL at the edge of the lava chasm the mine-
masters surround them

ORIN
Jump NOW

Orin shoves Elan into the ore transport fends off the mine-
masters with his laser drill The ore transport begins to
move out over the deep lava chasm

ELAN
(frightened)
Orin Orin

Orin leaps barely making it to the edge of the ore
transport He dangles over the lava Elan helps him up

They’re heading straight toward the flaming mouth of the
Furnace of Life

ORIN
Quick under the crystals

Orin and Elan duck under the crystals as the transport car
disappears into the blazing mouth consumed by the flames

FOLLOW THE ORE TRANSPORT as it enters a long steel
passageway illuminated by stark fluorescent lighting

The ore stir then Orin helps Elan out of the crystals They
look in awe at their strange surroundings and the flaming
gas jets that shoot fire out of the faux “mouth”

Orin helps Elan out of the transport car

INT ORE PROCESSING CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The transport car emerges into the sprawling futuristic
processing center Orin and Elan marvel at their incredible
surroundings

VOICE OVER
(synthesized)
All processing units to loading bay

ELAN
Where are we
ORIN
I dont know
VOICE OVER

Thirty-three thousand gross units to
the Darbang System ready for shipping

Orin spots some robot guards He and Elan make a run for it

Robot sentries fire down on them from above striking Orin
He stumbles Elan turns back to help him

ORIN
No no keep going

She rushes back to Orin cuts down an approaching robot with
her laser drill Then she helps Orin up They runright
into a half-dozen more robots They turn to run back coming
face to face with Zygon

ELAN
(gasps )
Zygon

The robots grab Orin and Elan from behind

ll

ZYGON
My congratulations You now know what
only one other slave has known in the
last twelve hundred years And like
him you will die with the secret You
might as well know the rest of the lie

Zygon lifts his mask off revealing his pale human face
ZYGON (CONTD)
(sarcastic laugh)

Behold the great god of Mineworld

Zygon grabs Elan by the neck lifts her off the floor

ELAN
(choking)
Orin
ORIN
(screaming rage)
No Stop

Elans body goes limp then Zygon lets her fall to the floor

ORIN (CONT’D)
No

Zygon turns to dispose of Orin spots the hilt in his
waistband

ZYGON

(recognizing it)
The Sword With No Blade

(he takes it)
Where did you get this

(Orin just stares back)
Im afraid it wont be of any use to
you now

Zygon starts to strangle Orin The golden hilt begins to
glow red hot Zygon drops it Orin uses the moment to break
free from the robots running across the processing area

The guards open fire with their blast rifles

ZYGON (CONT’D)
Watch out for the crystals

As Orin dives away from another barrage a stray flash of
laser strikes a load of crystals exploding with a
devastating blast which rips through the processing area
knocking Zygon and the others to the ground and opening a
gaping fissure in the rock wall

As the smoke clears Zygon and the others lie unconscious
Orin moves to Elan picks up her lifeless body hugs her
ORIN
(choked whisper)
If theres a world above Ill find it
for you Elan
He kisses her placid face

Zygon stirs A robot helps him up He shoves him away

ZYGON
Never mind me Kill the boy

Orin picks up the hilt and Elan’s laser drill runs through
the gaping hole in the wall

8 INT ROCKY FISSURE - CONTINUOUS

The robots move after Orin wounding him with their laser
fire But in doing so they start a cave in and are buried

11 INT NARROW SHAFT - VARIOUS SHOTS

Orin is nestled at the top of the shaft his back braced
against one side his feet against the other He blasts away

the rock with his laser drill Days pass until he finally
runs out of food and water

DISSOLVE TO

INT NARROW SHAFT

Orin sleeps at the top of the steep rocky shaft Dust
begins to fall on him then the slimy heads of white worms
(about one inch in diameter) drop onto his pale flesh They
open their suction-cup mouths and sink their hooklike fangs
into himand begin to suck out his blood

Orins eyes slowly open Then he jerks up spots the worms
all over him As he frantically tears them off he loses his
hold on the steep rocks sliding down the shaft

He barely catches hold to an outcropping dangling
precariously over the deep black shaft as his laser-drill
clatters down the rocks He gropes for it misses It falls
into the blackness As he struggles to climb back up

DISSOLVE TO

INT NARROW SHAFT

Orin sits on a ledge He takes the hilt from his waist
holds it out before his bitter eyes

ORIN
What have you got to tell me this time
old man Is this your magnificent
universe

Orin raises the hilt to throw it into the shaft stopped as
dirt begins to rain down over him Then an odd light
shimmers on his face He looks up at an opening in the rock
Through it we see a small patch of blue-black sky and a
single twinkling star

Orin reaches up toward the star as if trying to touch it

EXT HOLE IN GROUND - NIGHT

All that can be seen is a sparse patch of grass around a hole
of moist dirt A hand clutching the hilt reaches out of
the hole gropes the edge of the grassy soil A second hand
slaps onto the edge straining to get a firm grip

Orin pulls himself up climbing out into the night He looks
up at the stars tears filling his eyes

ORIN
(begins to cry)
Its not a lie Its not a lie

himself for the first time in his life Then his reflected

eyes grow narrow and greenand a huge snake emerges Orin
lets out a gasp and steps back He turns to run trips ona
tree root falls face-first into the swamp

Orin pulls his face out of the slime staring at a hideous
looking pair of legs Above the legs is a more hideous
humpbacked half-man-half-robot “mandroid” BORO stares at
Orin then lets out a disgusted groan

Orin gets up and runsright into another mandroid AHK
His face is a jumble of flesh and bionics his exposed guts
churning behind his stainless steel rib cage

AHK
(bloodthirsty grin)
A human

EEMA a hideous female with skin pulled tightly over her
metal skull grabs Orins hair

EEMA

17 EXT SWAMP - GIANT TREE - NIGHT

The tree is perhaps a thousand feet high its base a mass of
twisted roots that are themselves bigger than pine tree
trunks The tree is so large that smaller trees and shrubs
grow on its branches There is a flickering light deep
within the rooty mesh that grows up out of the swamp water

18 INT MANDROIDS DEN - GIANT TREE - NIGHT

Orins arms are bound spread-eagle to an overhanging root
Ahk sharpens a pair of metal clippers before Orin

ORIN
Im sorry I escaped I1l go back

worms eating it

Eema raps Orin’s arm with her metal claw

EEMA
You make no sense

Freg and the other mandroid run off after Orin
Boro picks up the clippers moves toward Ahks right arm

Orin races through the foggy swamp the two mandroids in
close pursuit He trips on a root The mandroids gain
Orin gets up and keeps running

A hand reaches out in front of him grabbing him by the
throat Orin gasps as a blast pistol aims at his face And
fires

The shoot flashes past Orin kills Freg A second shots
kills the other mandroid

DAGG DiBRIMI a tall man in a pilot’s jumpsuit and quilted
down vest chomps his cigar his pistol aimed at Orin

DAGG

withdraws it Nothing happens

DAGG (CONTD)

Orin looks at the hilt runs his hand past it The invisible
blade is gone He turns and runs tripped by Dagg Dagg

Orin looks up in horror as a giant swamp slug rises up behind
Dagg grab him in its tentacles Orin swings his hilt
cutting off a tentacle The beast screeches then lowers its
fanged face over Orin He slices a gash in its snout The
beast rears up in pain drops Dagg then slithers back into
the swamp

Dagg rises out of the water wipes the slime away

DAGG (CONTD)
How the hell did you do it

Orin looks at the hilt

ORIN

Dagg climbs up onto the roots of the large tree

ORIN
Please I need your help I promised
Kallie Id come back for him

Dagg makes his way up to a high branch that has been set up
for surveillance with a small electro-telescope on tripod

DAGG
Listen water snake I saved you You

(louder )
Now beat it

ARTHURS VOICE

I beg your pardon

Dagg picks up a radio handset

DAGG

He puts it down looks through the electro-scope

ARTHURS VOICE
Oh

Orin stays put as Dagg looks through his scope again

EXT PYRAMID - DAGGS POV - TELESCOPE MATTE - CONTINUOUS

The scene moves in and out of focus sharpening to reveal a
mammoth pyramid in the distance It is much like the
pyramids of Giza only bigger its sides peppered with
windows and lights Several large space freighters hover

The electro-scope shifts to another view revealing two armed
robot guards

DAGG (VO)
Pumped up security Any sign of that
patrol ship yet

He continues to scan the area

DAGG

DAGG
Who the hell do think Im talking to

ARTHURS VOICE
Why dont you make up your mind And
dont worry about the patrol Ill let
you know as soon as I spot it

As Dagg looks back through the scope a STARFLY--small

glowing ball of energy--hovers in his view It buzzes around
Dagg who reacts like a child afraid of bees swatting at it

DAGG
Get away from me damn starfly

The starfly buzzes right into Dagg’s radio handset

DAGG (CONT’D)
Hey Get out of here

Dagg swats again knocks the handset off the branch As he
gropes for it he loses his balance falls into the muddy
swamp before Orin

Orin can’t help but laugh Dagg tries to regain his
machismo as he wipes the scum off his face

As the starfly buzzes around Orin his smile disappears

ORIN
(frightened)
What are they

Dagg shakes the water off his cigar shoves it in his mouth

DAGG
Theyre pests like you

A starfly hovers before Orin its glowing aura dancing on his
face Orin reaches out and gently touches the starfly It
giggles then flies off

ARTHURS VOICE
(watery crackle)
Dagg

Dagg reaches into the swamp water withdraws the handset He
shakes the water out of it Another starfly flies out

DAGG
(annoyed)
What is it

ARTHURS VOICE
The pyramid patrol ship will be at your
present location in about thirty-two
point nine seconds

DAGG
Thirty seconds Why the hell didnt

Dagg quickly trots off

DAGG
Come on Theres a patrol coming

Orin just stands there

ORIN
Whats a patrol

Dagg rushes back to Orin sees the patrol ship coming fast

DAGG
Damn

He pulls Orin along with him The patrol ship strafes the
swamp where they were standing

Dagg and Orin run through the swamp as blazing shafts of
laser light flash past They approach Daggs medium-sized
cruiser the Starchaser parked in the muddy clearing

DAGG (CONTD)
Dont just sit there Arthur blast
those bastards

The hatch begins to close as Orin and Dagg disappear into the
ship As the patrol crafts laser fire splatters over the
Starchasers surface a laser-cannon spins around and blasts
the patrol craft out of the air

INT STARCHASER COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

Dagg gets into his control seat starts to switch on the
ships systems A small speak with flexible neck rises up

Aunt Bella looks up recognizes the figure

AUNT BELLA

Kallie gets up blindly moves forward

KALLIE
Orin Orin I knew he’d come back

Aunt Bella holds him back as Orin address the gathering
slaves

ORIN
Ever since I can remember there have
been rumorsrumors that there was
another worldthat long ago there was
more than just Mineworld Some said is
was a heaven a paradise beyond
imagination Others said is was a hell

(MORE)

ORIN (CONTD)

far worse than the world we know But
an old man saw the truth beyond the
sword and gave his life so that I might
reach out beyond these caverns reach
out to the greater world above Well
I have reachedand I have touched the
stars

MINE MASTER
Dont listen to him Zygon has warned
against such false saviors

SECOND SLAVE
Hes right Believing this fool will
only bring disaster

Fearful shouts begin to swell against Orin

ORIN
(over shouting)
He says what he wants you to believe

The slaves continue to argue

ZYGON (V0)
The boy is right

Orin turns to see Zygon step out of the furnace behind him
wearing his hideous horned mask

ZYGON
I say what I want you to believe
because I want you to believe the
truth

The slaves begin to chant Zygon’s name

ORIN
Liar

Orin draws his hilt rushes toward Zygon who fires his laser
pistol at the boy Orin deflects the fire with his “blade”
knocking the pistol out of Zygon’s hand A final thrust
knocks Zygon’s mask off and sends him to the ground

The slaves gasp in awe

Aviana comes out of the flames spots Orin But before she
can reach him Zygon grabs her by the throat

ZYGON
Give me the hilt Kha-Khan or she will
die like the other

ORINS POV ZYGON AND AVIANA

The image of Aviana is replaced by the similar image of Zygon
strangling Elan then the image returns to normal

Orin reluctantly hands the hilt to Zygon He shoves Aviana
aside then slices the hilt at Orin The Kha-Khan flinches
but the sword does nothing Zygon throws it to the ground
grabs Orin

He struggles with him moving to the edge of the lava chasm
pushing him over

Orin catches the rocky ledge He strains to hang on his
grip slipping the lava river steaming below

Suddenly the starfly emerges from the rocky cavern wall
hovers beside Orin

ORIN
(straining)
Get methe hilt

STARFLY
(whisper)
You do not need the hilt Orin There
never was a blade

As the words sink in Zygon moves to the edge of the chasm
He steps on one of Orins hands

ZYGON
It’s over Kha-Khan

Orin grabs Zygons boot As Zygon tries to step away Orin
hangs pulls himself up He gets to his feet facing the
towering robot Zygon picks up his blast pistol aims it at
Orin

With a sudden burst of intention Orin holds up his hand his
fingers curled as if there were a hilt in it A glowing
blade appears He slashes at Zygons hand cutting it off
Zygon holds up his sparking stub reacting in shock

ZYGON (CONT’D)
Buthow

ORIN
You were right Zygon I did have the
secret of the blade all along Only it
was so simple I couldnt see it

Orin forces Zygon back to the edge of the chasm

ZYGON
No

Orin makes a final swing cutting Zygon in two His sparking
body crumples falling backwards into the chasm dropping
into the smoking lava river Then Orin’s glowing blade
vanishes

Across the chasm the slaves turn on the mine masters
cutting them down with their mining tools forcing them over
the chasm into the lava

Aviana gets up moves to Orin They hug Then Orin turns to
his people
ORIN

If it doesn’t give him gangrene

It’s okay Silica I can manage

She heads the Starchaser for the last two fighter ships

SILICA
I’ve get those creeps who shot you
down

DAGG

She blasts away

One of the ships crashes into the crystals which explode with
a tremendous fireball A chain reaction of explosions starts

collapse The support beams start to crumble

The scene begins to rumble Rock begins to fall from above
The walls crack and crumble

bridge with Aviana just before it collapses into the lava

explosion

people below Dagg jumps out of his seat

Dagg grabs Silica who reacts with surprise He kisses her
on the lips but is met with an electrical arc that knocks him
back on his ass

EXT PYRAMID - SURROUNDING AREA - CONTINUOUS

As expressions of wonder are heard from Orins people Kallie
“looks” around

KALLIE
What does it look like Orin Tell me

Orin kneels before Kallie hugs his little brother He looks
at his empty hands then places them on Kallies staring
eyes Kallie blinks as if to focus A smile and tears break
onto his face

KALLIE (CONT’D)
I can see again I can see I can
see

The Starchaser lands nearby The hatch opens and Dagg and
Silica exit greeting the freed slaves

Aviana puts her arms around Orin and kisses him Suddenly
the starflies appear and circle them Aviana backs away

The starflies align in a row floating about six feet off the
ground The translucent images of six men and women
materialize from the glowing spots of energy They are
peaceful looking beings regally robed One of them is the
old man who appeared over the hilt

KHA-KHAN
You have done admirably young Orin
We welcome you as an honored member of
the Kha-Khan You are free to leave
your human form and come with us

A shimmering aura forms around Orins head A moment later a
glowing ball of energy similar to the starflies ascends
hovering over the others

The slaves gasp Aviana grabs Dagg distraught
The glowing ball of light descends back into Orin and
disappears Orin looks at Aviana then to Dagg then back at

the Kha-Khan

ORIN
Not yet Id like to stretch my legs
for a few decades

KHA-KHAN
The choice is yours

The energy above Orin descends back into him
The six transparent figures transform back into starflies and
streak off toward a twinkling constellation -- a

constellation in shape of a sword with no blade

FADE OUT
