INT BATEROOM HOLE IN THE WALL - DAY a7

Jonesy and Beaver stumble into the bathroom skidding on bloody
floor tiles Spastically they grab the doorjamb and each other
to keep from going down When theyve steadied themselves they
look at the scene before them thunderstruck

BEAVER

red mold now covers half his face

BEAVER
I don’t want to see this Jonesy -- man I

Beaver flipping out reaches to grab McCarthys shoulder --

BEAVER
That’s enough fella Snap out of it

re The blue

MeCarthy falls into the tub pushing the shower curtain ahead of

him -- Jonesy and Beaver SEE something end simultaneously SCREAM

We SEE it for only a split second (12 frames)

MeCarthy’s ass has a giant bloody crater in its center gs
though a shotmmn had fired from inside McCerthy’s body flops

into the tub and thank god the shower curtain hides the horror

“Suddenly there is ANOTHER SPLASHING SOUND in the water of the

toilet Beaver leans forward to look inside the bowl but Jonesy
reaches in front of him and SLAMS the lid down

JONESY
No

BEAVER
No

JONESY
No

ANOTHER SPLASH and the lid bumps up Beaver quickly sits on it

JONESY
Good move Beav
(thinking out loud)
Whatever it is its trapped Got
nowhere to go but the septic tank

Beaver’s face lights up and instantly he FLUSHES the toilet
listen to the water as it clears the bowl They wait tensely
it takes forever FLUSHING ends SILENCE Beever reaches into his
pocket - nervous compulsion -- and pulls out some toothpicks
Hes about to select one when there is a huge THUMP from inside
the bowl The toothpicks go flying

They

Beaver checks his pocket - no more toothpicks He looks et two

Jonesy wild with frustration because he can’t find it

Jonesy grabs it and starts limping out of the shed --

INT BATHROOM HOLE IN THE WALL - DAY 51
and TILT UP to Beaver He cant take it anymore he

needs the solace of that wooden sliver and hes convinced he cen
get eway with the four-inch move that will bring it to his grasp
So

o ») Quickly now he bends forward enough to grab the toothpick -- off
a the lid for just moment -- 2moment too Jong

Something hits the lid of the toilet with terrifying force -- the
lid catches Beaver in the balls and sends him pitching forward
He tries for balance by grabbing the shower curtain but --

-- the curtain pulls free CU ANGLE of the bar with a metallic
CLITTER-CLACK of rings popping free

The toilet seat flies up so hard that it CRACKS the porcelain
tank Water pours out

Beavers face is on the bloody floor in pain from his groin but
then something mich worse heppens SOMETHING lands on his back
we catch only a glimpse from this angle he can’t see it at all)
and he SCREAMS Whatever it is it’s on his back attached there
somehow Beaver pushes up from the floor and looks down his body
in time to see

The Things mascular tail come right between his legs open its

hideous tai pincers and grab hold of Beaver’s groin
Beaver’s face lifts up as he CRIES OUT in agony but not defeat
With and mighty effort aver jv down
trying to crush the Thing on the flee cries out with an
- - awful high-pitched CHITTERING SOUND O

ABOVE BEAVER now we SEE the pincers release’ a BLUR the
Thing wriggles out from under Beaver and EXITSUJAR FRAME Beever
rises up frantically twisting to locate it As turns we SEE
that his neck has a norrible wound and is gushing blood

PUSH IN on Beavers face as he SEES -- oh God there it is --

WE SEE IT CLEARLY FOR THE FIRST TIME clinging to the doorway
about heliway up this Thing this muscular tentacle several
feet long with two feverish black eyes Theres no way around
it ell things considered youve got to call it a SHIT ‘WEASEL

Now « the lower part of the head splits down along its body
revealing a nest of razor-sharp teeth

I t then withdraws too fast to

see Beaver has raised his hands to his face to ward it off
a moment he’s confused about what’s heppened but then --

-- he CRIES our agein -- i inge reo

JONESY (0 s 7

The Shit Weasel coils on the doorjamb end then launches itself
2 and on Beavers t

Beaver is knocked backwards the beck of his knees catching the
top of the toilet bowl He sits down violently into the bowl
this horror WRIGGLING on his chest -- tail wrapping eround his
torso pincers stabbing to grip

The Weasel draws back to strike at Beaver’s face and does but
at the very moment when we expect to see the worst Beaver’s good
hand oripns toi i z we and

andgets it between them

The Weasel catches it square in the mouth and is stopped an inch
from Beaver’s eyes For this one second one time Beaver has
kxriumphed The Weasel is confused It draws back and CHOMPS
through the 34° handle with no trouble SPRAYING splinters and
WET SLIME then arches to strike again

Jonesy at last arrives in the Gocrwey

JONESY
Beaver Beav what-

The Shit Weasel turns to look at Jonesy For a moment it seems it
might release Beaver and attack Jonesy instead Beaver senses

this and does the most extraordinary thing wrap
Sxround the Weese to keep it from launching at Jonesy

Jonesy registers Beaver’s last incredible sacrifice

BEAVER

CU BEAVER blood-splattered face turned for his last look at

Jonesy He turns back to his enemy in time to see --

SEAVERS POV the Weasel has returned its attention to him and is
at this moment ready to strike -- DIRECTLY AT CAMERA teeth and
maw coming right at Beaver’s eyes BERVERS WORLD GOES BLACK

Jonesy watches in horror as Beaver is Griven backwards over the
toilet (where mercifully we can’t fully see the damage In a

Split second pop goes the Weasel reappearing at the base of the

bowl and slitherinc fest right at Jonesy

Halfway across the room it lifts its head and launches at Jonesy
- who manages to SLAM the door just es the Shit Weasel hits The
door quakes and the wood distorts at the impact point but holds

INT OUTSIDE BATHROOM HOLE IN THE WALL - DAY 52

Jonesy grips the door knob with both hands From inside angry
CHITTERING The door begins to SHAKE

CU the doorknob es Jonesy holds it Now it starts to turn

Jonesy strains to maintain his grip The doorknob keeps on
turning until the pressure on the doorknob subsides

Jonesy tekes a breath He leans in close to adjust his grip
Suddenly right next to Jonesv’s head the Weasel is attacking
the door with its teeth punching at the wood égain and again

Jonesy terrified knows there’s not a thing he can do to stop it
biting through the door But his terror is replaced by a
realization and hot tears begin to pour down his face --

‘ JONESY
You killed him You killed Beaver
(screaming)
v
The doorknob begins to turn again with such force that Jonesy
cannot hold it The rod connecting the knobs SNAPS the doorknob
comes loose The door starts to open

Now something happens that makes Jonesy SHRIEK a shedow passes
ever him Hes not 2lone Jonesy spins

MR GRAY is standing benind him He’s an extraterrestrial You
can tell because he’s got thet look weve seen a thousand times
in a hundred subtle variations in movies and tabloids

Huge black eyes gray skin spindly legs Something almost
benevolent abour his appearance Hes ‘seven feet tall and while
it’s pretty horrifying actually having him there in the room

- it could be worse Were so familiar with this look its
almost as comforting as Mickey Mouse

Jonesy is frozen Mr Gray comes closer And closer still

AT FLOOR LEVEL the Shit Weasel slithers out of the bathroom
between Jonesy’s feet and over toMrGray’s legs where it

heads upwards spiralling gracefully up the ET’s body

TILT UP with the Weasel as it zips eround Mr Greys skinny chest
and setties on his shoulder The Shit Weasel coils as if to

strike at Jonesy but abruptly turns to look in the direction of
Jom the bedroom then launches itself off thet way landing with a

wet SMACK on the floor and unduleting eway

WHAT WE SEE (and Jonesy probably doesn’t as he flinches in
surprise) is that under the benevolent husk -- the good Grayboy
Gisguise -- is the TRUS MR GRAY And that is a truly horrible
sight Imagine the Shit Weasel grown to seven feet completely
covered in the red-gold slime and fully equipped with hideous
articulation We see it for only 8 frames

The red-gold slime-cloud of particles completely engulfs Jonesy’s
upper body

Jonesy inhales them He breathes them all in

and another We become aware of a HUGE DIN

CRANING UP past the sign end REVEALING that Gosselin’s has been

finished enclosing the entire property -- store barn and

bigger birds land beyond guided by e bevy of waving GROUND CREW-
Ouc of the small copter comes the fellow we saw before --

likely to meet In his sixties tall fit with white eyebrows --
great soldier ‘There’s something savage (and funny) about his
ferocious mien He heads toward 2 big Winnebago parked among
treilers Kurtz looks with interest at the corral

om TWO DOZEN HUNTERS from crusty old-timers to stylish L Lb
— Beaners are milling about the corral and barn More HUNTERS end
LOCALS are being broucht in now in trucks or herded in on foot
(Some show the red-gold fungus on exposed skin) Everyone goes
into the holding area The place looks like a prison camp

Kurtz Steps up to enter his Winnebago when HE SEES through the
swarming activity --

coed since they came down
OWEN
What then
KURTZ

Its all guesswork but from my limited
experience --

(Owen laughs an old joke)
-- Id say the real threat is them
getting out of our net Whether the
landing was planned-or not they’re gonna
send out scouts see if they get lucky
I always say they’ve never visited a
world they wouldn’t rather own

Owen watches him intently

And the Shit Weasels the ones blasting

(laughs losing it)
but seriously folks there is one
issue I‘d like to bring up just in case I
should you know kick the bucket out
here turn into a goddam Petesicle
not that I think that’s inevitable

IN THE SNOWBANK behind Pete we SEZ that somethine is moving
w Creating a raised moving map of its progress

toward Petes back Pete tekes a final swig and flips the empty
over his ‘shoulder into the snowbank -- the moving bulce stops

PETE
- I’m sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver
will be coming to get us soon enough
They’re my friends you see were all
best friends and friends don’t let each
other down Not never

The bulge in the snow starts moving toward Pete again

- which really relates to what I wanted)
to bring up here Now ma’‘em Im gonna

PETE (contd)
AK be very candid with you about this So

Pete suddenly falls silent Glumly he opens a new bottle The
moving bulge in the snowbank is right behind him now

PETE

Thats crazysi Im talkin’ shit about
the only perfect person I ever knew Hes
S50 goddam good I cant believe hes a
human Man I should be singing his

praises not questioning what galaxy -- I
gotta pee thats wnat I should be

Pete stands up painfully and turns to face the snowbank He

unzips his pants with some difficulty then writes in the snow
with his piss »p-u-a-d-

fC) PETE a
bee Heres to you Duds the highest civilian
decoration--

‘He pisses the vertical stroke of the “i” and then dots it

The snow melts away under the warm stream REVEALING the noded
red-gold head of Becky’s SHIT WEASEL

Pete squints not sure what he’s seeing --

PETE
Lord I will never drink again

The Weasel launches itself out of the snow directly et Pete’s
crotch we CANT SEE where the impact happens but its bad

Pete doubles over in agony and grabs the slimy wriggling Weasel
trying to pull it off The Weasels CHITTERING merges with PETES
SCREAMS They begin a whirling battle --

CUT TO Beckys peaceful dead countenance -- 2 mute witness

The Weasels tail is around Pete’s thigh trying to imbed its

pincers in his lower back Pete staggers seems about to fall

But even drunk and hurt he’s still an athlete Still gripping
o the Weasel he looks down and A b

if

ie IN THE PIRE Pete isnt feeling the heat yet through his heavy
clothes but the Weasel reacts with a deafening SCREECH It
releases its hold on Pete and shoots out of the fire CHITTERING
wildly Pete rolis out of the fire tears of pain rolling down
his cheeks He grabs a burning piece of wood as he goes

OUT OF THE FIRE now Pete looks around desperately to locate the
Weasel which has diseppeared from view

PETE’S POV desperately scanning the area -- the snowbank the
root of the shelter the litter of bottles and bags -- finally
settling on Beckys lifeless boay

Pete’ squints at Becky through flooded eyes He holds the torch in
front of him defensively hesitant to look down at his dameged
groin Now he leoks down winces in horror then HEARS the
grotesque CHITTERING He looks up to see --

- the Weasel rise from behind Beckys head and launch itself
Pete dodges ‘but the Weasel has got hold of him near his left
ear The creature swings out to full length from Petes head as
he spins around then wreps its tail under his arm and preperes

‘oO

At that moment in the second before the mortal strike Pete
brings the fleming torch vp and SLAMS it into the head of the
Weasel even though it means burning his own face The Wezsel
SCREECHES in shock and flies off into the snow

adversary and goes efter it torch in hand -- RIGHT PAST CAMERA

WIDE SHOT Everything looks okay from here Beautiful in fact
weathered cabin heavy snowtell embracing forest Here comes
Henry slogging to the end of his long walk

CLOSER SHOT with Henry now seeing what he sees when he sees
it He stops on the granite slab and looks inside

INT ROLE IN THE WALL - DAY

The interior overrun with red-gold fungus COMES INTO VIEW as
Henry edges inside SERIES OF SHOTS We can actually see the fuzz
growing like slow-moving lava Henry looks up stunned

REVERSE BOOMING UP so what he’s looking at is REVEALED at the
top of the move -- The Dreamtatcher all but obliterated by the

growth like a red-gold wasps’ nest only a bit not yet enguifed

HENRY

You caught a hell of 2 nightmare this

time
Suddenly Henry gets a chilling feeling that something jis behind
the door

he’s standing next to He quickly pulls the door closed
terrified There is something -- Jonesy’s deer rifle Henry picks

up the rifle checks the chamber then takes it with him as he
moves carefully into the room watching where he steps There is
pile of something hidden in mold) by the bathroom door

HENRY
What is this
(calling out)
Beav

Shining in the pile is the doorknob next to it lies the roll of
friction tape where Jonesy dropped it (We have the feeling that
something could spring from the pile at any moment)

Henry looks into what this morning was a blue bathroom and is now
red cave of fungus Henry sees a Doc Marten boot sticking out
of the bathtub full of mold His worst fears are confirmed

HENRY
ah Beaver shit fuck me Freddy

Huge tears toll Gown his cheeks Suddenly he FLINCHES Hes
standing in the exact spot where Mr Gray’s head exploded

WE SEE IT HAPPEN AGAIN as does Henry in a futzed distorted
amase Mr Gray’s outer husk explodes and Jonesy is engulfed in

the cloud of red-gold particles which Jonesy inhales

Henry is devasteted He backs awey from that spet as though he’s
just seen the actual event happen

He EEARS something stops tries to identify whet it is -- a
CHITTERING SOUND Henry lifts the rifle as he inches toward a
view of the bedroom The NOISE gets LOUDER Henry reaches the
door looks inside end reacts in horror

CHITTERING angrily on the blood-soaked bed sits the Shit Weasel

that killed Beaver Mouth open fangs ready huge eyes staring at

Henry Its muscular body is wrapped protectively eround --

-- one hundred esas the size of big marbles orange-brown

covered with a murky wet substance Inside each one a hairlike
a vesThe Weasel lifts up but the speed we saw before is

gone -- the laying of the eggs has sapped that

Henry unshoulders his rifle The Weasel CHITTERS like crazy
Henry fires a deafening GUNSHOT and -- he missed

HENRY
Asshole

The Weasel moves toward him Henry sweating fires again The
Shit Weasel’s HEAD EXPLODES its body blown off the bed Henry
looks at the eggs thinks then races out of the room

Henry reaches in and grabs a can of barbecue lighter fluid From

the counter he snatches a box of matches then heads back
INT BEDROOM HOLE IN THE WALL - DAY 68

Henry comes to the foot of the bed and extends his arm to squirt
the lighter fluid Suddenly he stops peers at something He
squints not sure what he’s seeing then moves up along the bed

HENRYS POV MOVING INon some thing or things in the shadow of
the pillow We recognize it at the same moment Henry does --
twenty of ‘the weasel eggs but these are cracked open and emotv

Henry reacts and simultaneously HEARS horrible MEWLING CRIES
He looks down at his feet A dozen worm-like NEWBORN WERSELS are”
crawling out from under the bed Two are already climbing up his
pant leg and a third is trying to work its way into his boot

Henry jumps back kicking out with his foot The Weasel on his
boot flies off He swats the two on his pants to the floor and

STOMPS them He squirts the lighter fluid on the floor where che

others are sliding toward him then onto the bed The worms react
to the Zluid MEWLING unbearably evk i

——

CY Henry becks across the room sliding open the box of matches His
BONA hands are shaking badly He gets couple of the matches out but

juggles the box and loses it It falls onto the floor

Henry STOMPS the Weasels in the lead and tries to light the
match in his hand with his thumbnail - once STOMP twice
STOMP STOMP His hands wont stay stall

ANGLE DOWN on Henrys shaking hand flicking desperately at the
match head Beyond his hand the Weasel worms are sliding toward
him And then finally --

-- FIRE Henry drops the match into the puddle of Zluid and the
floor erupts in flame And then the bed As the fire spreads
there are POPPING SOUNDS as the eggs burst and high-pitched
MEWLING as theWeasel worms curl into black crisps Henry backs
out of the bedroom squirting more fluid as he goes

JonesyMz Gray looks in that direction

A newborn SHIT WEASEL writhes into view over the dead pody of the
German Shepherd its body shiny with bloody slime Its eyes shed
a milky film and their bottomless blackness tekes on intelligent
life It looks at JonesyMr Gray and starts toward the shaft

With a smile JonesyMr Gray watches the Weasel move toward him

HENRY (0S)
Look out Jonesy or whoever the fuck
you are

JonesyMr Gray looks sharply to the door As does the Weasel

Henrys got the MP5 pointed at the Shit Weasel but when he pulis
the trigger the gun set for euto-fire goes off in a HUGE
BURST Something Henry is not prepared for

Bullets smash down around the Weesel but don’t hit it The

an

Wezsel rears up CHITTERING and bares its needie-like teeth

OO

So shocked is Henry by the lightning in his hands he almost
Grops the gun Finally he manages to stop firing In an instant
the Shit Weasel is attacking SNAKING in a blur toward Henry

Henry tries to regain control of his weapon but his hands are
Shaking his finger can’t find the trigger -- and the Weasel is
SHRIEKING and coming on like a rocket

The Weasel is about ten feet from Henry when it draws its body up
and i i ix

Henry looks wp from his fumbling to see the Weasel flying toward
him Reflexively hes brought the gun up too And then it
happens a frozen instant in time

The Shit Weasel arrives jaws wide to bite out Henrys throat
What it gets instead is a mouthful of the MP5 muzzle For one
Aanstant total confusion the Wezsel WRIGGLES to disencage Henry
stares at what hes caught on his line Henrys finoer finds the

‘Exjoger and a tiny smile flicks across his lips as he FIRES --

The last remaining Shit Weasel in New England takes a ovllet full

of leaé and is blown across the room as A HOLLOW BLOODY TUBE OF
SLIME

Henry stops firing Ke looks down at the MP5 uncertain how much
ammunition he’s got left then up at JonesyMr Gray

JonesyMr Gray appears to be in convulsion his body wracked by
some violent exorcism The last wrenching paroxysm heaves him to
the floor in a helpless puddle -- hip ruined bloody spent --
not so different from his condition after the accident

JonesyMr Gray raises his head - blinking back tears -- and
speaks in the perfect voice of Gary Jones

JONESYMR GRAY

wouldnt let medie

Henry isn’t sure what to do Legs shaking he stumbles back to

a asd not resistance

know myself if Mr Gray is gone He
could be hiding in here somewhere waiting

Henry in agony sinks to the floor back against the wall Now
they’re looking across the floor at the same level He doesn’t
want to kill his friend He doesn’t know what to do Finally --

Henry HEARS en EERIE SOUND -- like some interstellar vacuum
breaking - and turns to look across the room

WHAT -HE SEES Jonesy lies exhausted on the floor just es before
And that’s all he cen do lie there

But xisino out of him and full seven feet tall is the Tre Mee
Grav in all his horror Except at this moment it is Mr Gray
who is afraid He speaks only one word but it’s in the voice of
Orson Welles

MR GRAY
You

Duddits is so weak he can barely remain standing but he lifts
his right hand and points his finger et Mr Gray

aed Mr Gray takes the hit in the center of tne tly maw which
- bifurcates his toothy chest The creature is Wis ws
across the room where he SPLATTERS against th in a slimy
mass of gray and red and gold

The mess runs down the wall and forms into a pool on the floor
In two seconds it turns to red-gold fungus A second later it’s
white and flakey And then it is just dust

Henry and Jonesy -- ‘ang itis Jonesy again -- turn to Duddits
Duddits looks from one to the other Hes slipping away fast ‘now
Whatever that was he just did it took his last earthly energy
Ke looks at them And smiles that great smile

JONESY
“You were The Dreamcatcher Duds You
caught the nightmare and stopped it dead

Jonesys voice cracks He looks up at Henry whos wiping his
eyes Henry looks at him There’s a pregnant momentThey‘re here
for a purpose but they can’t pull it off Finally Henry laughs
embarrassed --

HENRY -
I dont think I can do it I can’t carry
a tune

JONESY

Tough shit Lets hear it

He turns toward the tombstone and Henry follows suit Haltingly
painfully at first they begin to sing And as they go they
sound 2 little bit better --

SONESY AND HENRY
‘I feel so bad I’ve got a worried mind
Im so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby on -
Blue Bayou’

WIDE SHOT The two men continue to sing doing their best

JONESY AND HENRY
‘Savin’ nickels savin’ dimes
Workin’ til the sun don‘t shine
Lookin’ forward to happier times on Blue -
Bayou

Now we can barely see them out there among the tombstones Burt
they continue to sing So ‘

FADE OUT
