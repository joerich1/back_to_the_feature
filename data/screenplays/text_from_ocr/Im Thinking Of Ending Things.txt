INT FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - DAY 27

Everything is slower now The Janitor’s POV takes in the
environment as it moves toward the table with a cup of
coffee The room is neat but old slightly tattered the
drapes are heavy and oppressive It feels airless a place
with endlessly wandering ghosts The Janitor once again
places the coffee on the dining room table sits scoops
sugar from a bowl dumps it in the coffee stirs turns on
the small portable TV on the table Snow on the screen He
switches the channel and a young couple appears engaging to
a bouncy musical score in a happy dating montage The man
sips at his coffee and watches for a long moment checks his
watch stands heads to the kitchen The bouncy music
continues but recedes as he walks away from the TV The
whispering builds

INT FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY 28

The Janitor brings the cup and spoon to the sink and washes
them He glances out the window above the sink at the world
outside It is a gray windy winter day Old crusty snow on
the ground A rusted swing set sits in the yard the swings
creaking in the wind He dries the dishes puts them away
scans the kitchen for anything out of place He refolds a
poorly folded dishrag hangs it from its hook spends a
moment to even it out He exits the kitchen

INT DINING ROOM - DAY 29
The Janitor passes the still turned-on TV glances at it

The couple are in a field on their backs and under a
blanket looking up at the night sky

YOUNG TV MAN
How did we ever find each other in
all this vastness Almost makes a
scientist like me believe in
destiny

YOUNG WOMAN
Almost makes an artist like me
believe in scientists

He laughs They kiss The Janitor has passed the TV and makes

his way upstairs
INT FARMHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

EXT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 33

The Janitor lunch bag and thermos in hand crunches on the
hard snow

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 34

The Janitor makes his way through the empty hall The bell
sounds sudden and loud and the hall is filled with raucous
students The Janitor is invisible to them as they
carelessly maneuver their way around him He watches their
faces their interactions their youth their romances their
enthusiasm He spots the outliers the lonely the ugly the
desperately sad

INT CUSTODIAN’S ROOM - DAY 35

The Janitor opens his locker places his lunch and thermos on
the shelf and removes his shirt revealing a sagging old
man’s torso He changes into a dark work shirt emblazoned
with the school’s name He closes the locker organizes the
supplies on his cart rolls it to the door and waits until
the voices of the students peter out Then he opens the door
wheels the cart into the mostly empty hall

INT HALL —- DAY 36
There are only a few student stragglers The Janitor pushes
the cart wheels it into the first classroom

INT CLASSROOM ONE - DAY 37

THE JANITOR EMPTIES THE ROOM’S TRASH CANS INTO THE LARGE ONE
ON HIS CART HE WIPES A DUST RAG ALONG THE TABLE TOPS AND
THE WINDOW LEDGE OUTSIDE SNOW HAS STARTED TO FALL HE
WATCHES THE SNOW SEEMINGLY TRANSFIXED

EXT BROWNSTONE STREET - DAY 38

A Young Woman waits She is dressed for the cold her quirky
adorable outfit topped with a cheerily colorful wool beanie
She looks both ways down the street waiting for someone She
notices the snowflakes and playfully tries to catch a few on
her tongue

Yellow Rev 10

Suddenly she feels self-conscious glances around to see if
she is being watched peering into dark apartment windows
She spots a young man driving toward her This is Jake A
fleeting look of worry passes across her face then she
smiles waves enthusiastically He smiles back waves pulls
to a stop in front of her She opens the door

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s snowing

JAKE
Winter is icummen in

YOUNG WOMAN
Goddamn

They laugh She climbs into the car They kiss

INT CAR - DAY 39

They drive through a university town it is oddly
underpopulated She looks out the window Although her outfit
is the same the colors seem more subdued now Jake watches
the road She glances over at him takes in his face in
profile Feeling her eyes on him he glances over She
smiles He smiles self-consciously looks back at the road
She flips down her sun visor opens the mirror the mirror is
missing she flips the visor back up Her mood has turned
somber The whispering sound increases in volume

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I’m thinking of ending things

Silence

JAKE
Huh

YOUNG WOMAN
What’s that

JAKE
Did you say something

YOUNG WOMAN
(laughing)
No I don’t think so

JAKE
Weird

YOUNG WOMAN
Ha Yeah

Silence

JAKE
Car ghosts

YOUNG WOMAN
(playfully)
Spooooky

JAKE
Ha Yeah

Silence

JAKE (CONTD)
Boo

YOUNG WOMAN
Ha

Silence She looks out the window

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I’m thinking of ending things

Jake glances over again She doesn’t make eye contact
looks back to road

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
What’s the point of carrying on
like this I know what it is where
it’s going Jake is a nice guy
but It’s not going anywhere
I’ve known this for a while now
Maybe it’s human nature to keep
going even in the face of this
knowledge The alternative
requires too much energy
decisiveness People stay in
unhealthy relationships because
it’s easier It’s basic physics An
object in motion tends to stay in
motion people tend to stay in
relationships past their expiration
date Newton’s first law of
emotion

JAKE
Do you want to stop for a coffee or
something A snack It’s going to
get pretty farmy pretty fast now

He

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh No I’m fine

JAKE
You sure

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t want to spoil my appetite

JAKE
Ok

Silence She studies his hands on the steering wheel He self-
consciously takes the one closest to her from the wheel and
slips it into his jacket pocket

JAKE (CONTD)
Yknow my mother hasn’t been
feeling well recently So

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry

JAKE
I’m just saying that there might
not be much of a spread She might
not be up to a lot of cooking
(beat)
She hasn’t been well

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry to hear that What’s
going on with --

JAKE
I’m just saying if you want to
stop for a snack it would probably
be fine In terms of appetite
spoiling In terms of the amount of
food she might have prepared It
might even be advisable

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m fine

JAKE
Ok

Silence

JAKE (CONTD)
They really are looking forward to
meeting you

(MORE )
She looks

Silence

JAKE (CONTD)
I don’t want to give you the wrong
impression I’ve told them a lot
about you

YOUNG WOMAN
(looking over at Jake)
That’s nice to hear I’m looking
forward to meeting them too

out the window

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
Maybe it’s unfair of me to be going
on this trip with Jake When I’m
so uncertain about our future Our
lack of it After all going to
meet your boyfriend’s parents is
the proverbial next step isn’t it
The truth is I haven’t even told
my parents I’m dating Jake I’ve
never mentioned him And I don’t
think I ever will I guess that
says a lot about my intentions

JAKE
It’s just that she hasn’t been
feeling well So

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry Getting old ain’t for
sissies as Bette Davis said

JAKE
True Although one might take issue
with her use of the word sissy as a
pejorative

YOUNG WOMAN
Of course Yes A different time

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I guess it’s curiosity Jake is
certainly hard to figure Maybe
it’s like a window into his
origins The child being father of
the man and all

JAKE
Oh are you a fan of Wordsworth
then by chance

YOUNG WOMAN
Wordsworth

JAKE
William Wordsworth The poet

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not familiar really Why do
you ask

JAKE
I was just thinking about him for
some reason He popped into my
head His poem Ode Intimations of
Immortality from Recollections of
Early Childhood to be specific

YOUNG WOMAN
Jesus that’s the title Seems like
an entire poem

JAKE
Ha Yeah

Silence She silently counts syllables
YOUNG WOMAN

I tried to make it into a haiku
Too many syllables Damn

JAKE
Ha You get your words’ worth with
Wordworth
YOUNG WOMAN
Ha
JAKE
(beat)

You want to hear how it starts

YOUNG WOMAN
Ok Sure

As Jake recites the young woman watches the passing bleak
farmland
JAKE

(reciting)
There was a time when meadow
grove and streamThe earth and
every common sightTo me did
seemApparelld in celestial
lightThe glory and the freshness
of a dreamIt is not now as it
hath been of yore—Turn
wheresoeer I mayBy night or
dayThe things which I have seen I
now can see no more

YOUNG WOMAN
Huh Well that’s heavy Sad

JAKE
It goes on like that More or less

YOUNG WOMAN
You recite it well I like your
voice

JAKE
I guess there’s hope in it too
But I dunno maybe they have to

do that give people something

YOUNG WOMAN
I confess I haven’t read a lot of
poetry I guess I mostly don’t
understand it
(joking)
I’m not a metaphorical-type gal

JAKE
It’s just that that one speaks to
me

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah

JAKE
Incidentally Wordsworth wrote a
series of poems to a woman named
Lucy

YOUNG WOMAN

Like me

JAKE
Exactly A beautiful idealized
woman who dies young

Yellow Rev 16

YOUNG WOMAN
Yikes

JAKE
Ha Well the comparison goes only
as far as your name

YOUNG WOMAN
Phew

JAKE
And that you are ideal of course

YOUNG WOMAN
(uneasily)
Aw That’s sweet

She smiles at him Silence
A phone rings loud surprising Urgently the Young Woman

fishes in the bag by her feet finds the phone pulls it out
checks the caller Lucy YOUNG WOMAN APPEARANCE CHANGE

JAKE
Who’s that

YOUNG WOMAN
Just a friend I’m not going to
answer

JAKE
You can I don’t mind You should

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s ok

JAKE
I don’t mind

She drops the phone back in her bag

JAKE (CONTD)
Mysterious

YOUNG WOMAN
What’s that

JAKE
A friend

YOUNG WOMAN
Ha Not really Someone from class

She looks out the window at depressed and abandoned farms
She sees a collapsed farm house with a brand new swing set in
the front yard It’s jarring

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
That’s odd

JAKE
What’s that

YOUNG WOMAN
Did you see that swing set

JAKE
What swing set

YOUNG WOMAN
We just passed it

JAKE
Nope Missed it

YOUNG WOMAN
It was weird This beautiful new
swing set in front of an abandoned
house

JAKE
I didn’t see it

YOUNG WOMAN
Why would that be there Clearly
no one has lived in that house for
years Decades

JAKE
I didn’t see it
(beat)
Maybe someone is moving in and they
brought the swing set first
That’s all I can think of

YOUNG WOMAN
I suppose
(beat)
That seems an unlikely sequence of
events

JAKE
Well I didn’t see it
(beat)
Like to have something to entertain
the kids while the parents are
getting the house ready
Yellow Rev 18

YOUNG WOMAN

Huh Yeah
(beat)
Odd
JAKE
Who knows
(beat)

They’re saying there might be a
fair amount of snow

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah

JAKE
They’re predicting it

YOUNG WOMAN
Do you think we should maybe turn
back I’ve got a fair amount -- a
lot actually -- of work to do
tomorrow I need to be able to get
home tonight so I can get to it
first thing

JAKE
I think we’ll be ok I’ve got tire
chains in the trunk

YOUNG WOMAN
(dubious)
Ok

JAKE
What are you working on

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh um I have a paper due
Wednesday

JAKE
Which one is this

YOUNG WOMAN
Susceptibility to rabies infection
in the sensory dorsal root ganglia
neurons

JAKE
Right The trigeminal ganglia as
well right

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes Exactly

JAKE
Point for me Interested in and
knowledgeable about my girlfriends
work

She reacts to the “my girlfriend”

YOUNG WOMAN
Point for Jake

JAKE
How’s the paper going

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s nowhere actually I really do
have to get back tonight Deal with
it first thing

JAKE
I’ll get you home Chains

YOUNG WOMAN
Chains

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I do like Jake And he’s educated
Our fields are different but he’s
curious and keeps up That’s a good
thing That’s in the pro column

She smiles over at Jake He smiles back seemingly relieved

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
And he’s cute In his awkward way
We are interesting together as
well People look at us when we’re
together Who’s that couple I
don’t get looked at alone Not
much And Jake doesn’t either he
tells me Maybe that’s the way it
is in general for guys No one
looks at them But Jake has told
me he feels it feels invisible

JAKE
Want to listen to something

He has white crust in the corner of his mouth She fixates on
it

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry what

He wipes away the crust as if he knows she’s seeing it

JAKE
I asked if you want to listen to
some music

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh Sure

Jake switches on the radio dials through the static

JAKE
When you get out this far there’s
not much signal

He finds a station playing Many a New Day from the musical
Oklahoma The reception is iffy giving the music an almost
underwater burble and in addition it sounds amateurish
performed by high school students

SINGER
Many a new face will please my eye
Many a new love will find meNever
have I once looked back to sigh
Over the romance behind meMany a
new day will dawnBefore I do

YOUNG WOMAN
This is an odd song Out here in
the middle of nothing

JAKE
It’s from Oklahoma The musical

YOUNG WOMAN
Apt

JAKE
Indeed

YOUNG WOMAN
I didn’t realize you were a fan of
musical theater You’re full of
surprises

JAKE
I’m not really Into musicals I
mean I may be full of surprises
though That’s not for me to say
Anyway I just know a few musicals

INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON 40

The Janitor sweeps between the seats while on stage a
rehearsal for Oklahoma is in progress High school girls
dance around the girl playing Laurey as she sings along with
an inept orchestra A high school-quality farm house set
squats on the stage behind them A teenage girl dressed as
an old lady sits on a rocker on the porch

SINGER
Many a light lad may kiss and fly
A kiss gone by is bygoneNever have
I asked an August skyWhere has

wandered through the ryeWondering
where has some guy goneMany a new
day will dawnBefore I do

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
Protesting too much about how ok
everything is

JAKE
True

Jake watches the road in silence Then

JAKE (CONTD)
That’s why I like road trips It’s
always good to remind yourself that
the world is larger than the inside
of your own head Y’know

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE

YOUNG WOMAN
It is pretty out here In a
heartbroken bleak kind of way

JAKE
Wow

YOUNG WOMAN
(laughing)
“Wow” is pretty much an all-purpose
exclamation I just realized It
could mean you loved it or that
there are no other words to
describe how rubbish it is

JAKE
I love it That’s what it means

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah I don’t know

JAKE
It’s amazing I feel like it’s
about me Like completely

YOUNG WOMAN
Well thanks I guess that’s the
thing one hopes for when writing a
poem

JAKE
What’s that

YOUNG WOMAN
Some universality in the specific
I don’t know

JAKE
Yeah A feeling of connection It’s
like you wrote it about me I don’t
know how you do it

YOUNG WOMAN
Do what

JAKE
Think in words without setting
those thoughts in stone Use
language not to corral the world
but to set it free

YOUNG WOMAN
Wow

They both laugh at her use of the word “wow”

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Anyway I don’t know that I do all
that but thanks

JAKE
You really do It’s a marvel

YOUNG WOMAN
A marvel no less Well thanks

JAKE
Sure

YOUNG WOMAN
You’re very sweet

The Young Woman looks out the window

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I’m thinking of ending things Jake
is really great He’s sensitive
He listens to me He’s smart
There’s just something
ineffable Profoundly unutterably
unfixably wrong here I almost wish
he were horrible some monster
that he beat me that he was a
drunk that he ignored me Then my
decision would be clear

She looks over at Jake He glances back fearful
YOUNG WOMAN (VO)

But he’s just not right And no
amount of more time will fix that
JAKE
Is something wrong I’m feeling --

YOUNG WOMAN
No

JAKE
You seem sort of far away is all

Just thinking

JAKE
About what

YOUNG WOMAN
(considering stalling)
About what Hmm I don’t know
Just vague “in my head” stuff
(beat)
I guess maybe I was thinking about
time

JAKE
Really

YOUNG WOMAN
How it’s in charge of us like
we’re on a train and it takes us
where it takes us There’s no
veering off No side trips And
like Mussolini’s trains it runs on
time

JAKE
I read that it’s not really true
about Mussolini and trains The
improvements in the railway system
preceded him He just took credit
And even so they still didn’t
always run on time

YOUNG WOMAN
Huh I guess that’s not really
where I was going with that
analogy Not really about
Mussolini

JAKE
(beat)
Anyway you can always jump off a
train right

YOUNG WOMAN
In movies maybe In real life you
will likely die jumping from a
moving train

JAKE
That’s true I suppose I watch too
Many movies That’s very true

YOUNG WOMAN
Everyone does A societal malady

JAKE
I fill my brain with lies to pass
the time And it does pass -- in

the blink of an eye An eye blink
in excruciatingly slow motion

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s like the rabies virus
attaching itself to our ganglia
then changing us into itself

JAKE
Viruses are monstrous

YOUNG WOMAN
Everything wants to live Jake
Viruses are just one more example
of everything

JAKE
I suppose

YOUNG WOMAN
Even crappy fake movie ideas want
to live They grow in your brain
replacing your real ideas That’s
what makes them dangerous

JAKE
But did you know there are insects
that blow themselves up So there’s
that Not everything wants to live

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes Certain ants certain aphids

JAKE
For the good of their communities

YOUNG WOMAN
Suicide bombers

Yellow Rev 29

JAKE
So not everything wants to live

YOUNG WOMAN

True Well they want their
communities to live which is sort
of like themselves writ large

(beat)
And also we don’t know if they
really want anything It’s more
likely just how they’re programmed

JAKE
Maybe we’re all programmed Right

He looks at her for some kind of confirmation The Young
Woman glances over at him and makes a gesture and noise as if
she’s exploding They laugh

YOUNG WOMAN
Now we’re both dead

Silence

The driveway is long and bumpy with potholes They make their
way to the house in silence park It is the farmhouse the
Janitor lives in She studies the house illuminated by the
headlights Jake looks over at her trying to gauge her
reaction The house is completely dark There are no other
cars in the driveway

JAKE (CONTD)
You hate it

YOUNG WOMAN
No It just looks like no one is
home Are you sure we have the

BAT INTEXT BARN - EVENING B47
Jake and Young Woman walk towards barn

JAKE
I used to love to be outside here
when I was a kid The stars are
amazing here when it’s not cloudy
I would lie on my back and look at
them for hours I don’t know when
I stopped doing that It’s weird
there was a last time I did that
and I didn’t know at the time that
it would be Isn’t that
interesting The last time you do
something is often a secret from
you at the time

YOUNG WOMAN
It is interesting

They park and walk towards the barn

JAKE
Maybe we’1ll come back in the spring
and we can lie out here and look up
at the universe Then whenever
that was won’t have been my last
time My last time will be with
you

YOUNG WOMAN
That sounds nice

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I do like that Jake once had this
side to him A child filled with
wonder He’s so burdened now
which makes me sad and is made all
the more heartbreaking knowing that
there is still an innocent child
buried under all that

They arrive at an old barn
Yellow Rev 34

JAKE
The sheep are in here Id say we
could feed them but Dad probably
gave them some grain --
(checks watch)
-- about an hour ago So But we
can go in and say hi

Jake enters the barn The Young Woman follows

JAKE (CONTD)
Hi sheep

YOUNG WOMAN
Hi sheep

INT BARN - EVENING 47

It’s darker in here but the sheep are visible in silhouette
There is the sound of rustling and breathing and chewing

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
There’s something dreary and sad in
here And it smells I wonder what
it must be like to be a sheep to
spend one’s entire life in this
miserable smelly place doing
nothing Eating Shitting
Sleeping Over and over

JAKE
They’re always chewing like that
It’s their cud

YOUNG WOMAN
What’s cud

JAKE
Semi-digested food They
regurgitate it and chew it Sheep
gum

YOUNG WOMAN
Yum Sheep gum

JAKE
(brightly)
Well there you have it the sheep

Jake leads the way out

Yellow Rev 35

INT BARN - EVENING 48

They pass three stacked dead lambs Jake walks right past
without acknowledging them The Young Woman stops to look
She hurries to catch up

YOUNG WOMAN
What will happen to the lambs

JAKE
What

YOUNG WOMAN
The lambs

JAKE
Oh those dead ones

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes

Jake keeps walking says nothing She follows

JAKE
(impatient)
I don’t know what you’re asking
They’re already dead What else can
happen to them

YOUNG WOMAN
I mean will they be buried

JAKE
Probably be burned come spring
But they’re frozen solid for now
So They’re fine No worries
C’mon I’1ll show you the old pen
where they used to keep the pigs
They don’t keep pigs anymore

YOUNG WOMAN
Ok

JAKE
Because pigs are hard to keep
Yellow Rev They arrive at the empty pig pen The young woman looks
toward the house in the distance

JAKE (CONTD)
They had to put them down

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh That’s too bad

JAKE
Rotten situation The pigs Life
isn’t always pretty on a farm
Something you should know

Jake just waits

YOUNG WOMAN
(feeling forced to ask)
So what happened

JAKE
To the pigs Forget it I don’t
think you’d like this story

YOUNG WOMAN
You have to tell me now You can’t
do that

JAKE
Yeah

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes Jesus

JAKE
Ok Well my father hadn’t been in
to check on the pigs for a few
days My parents were busy He’d
just toss their food into the pen
But after a few days he noticed
they were just lying in the same
corner all the time So he went
inside to check on them They
didn’t look well He decided he’d
better try to move them And
they’re heavy -- I mean they’re
pigs right -- but he finally
moved one and discovered that its
entire underside was filled with
Maggots Both pigs were being eaten
alive Life on a farm can be
brutal Should we go in It’s cold

Yellow Rev 37

Jake walks the Young Woman follows

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
One likes to think there is always
hope It is a uniquely human
fantasy that things will get
better born perhaps of the
uniquely human understanding that
things will not There’s no way to
know for certain but I suspect
humans are the only animals that
know the inevitability of their own
death Other animals live in the
present Humans cannot So they
invented hope

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Well unfinished Just the water
heater Washer and dryer Stuff
like that We don’t use it really
for anything else Never did

YOUNG WOMAN
Ok

JAKE
More or less a waste of space
(beat)
I hate the basement if you want to
know

YOUNG WOMAN
You have intense feelings about it

JAKE
(pulling back on reaction)
You know when you’re a kid
basements are scary

YOUNG WOMAN
We didn’t have one Living in an

scary movies to get the idea

through the swinging kitchen door He runs up to and jumps

YOUNG WOMAN
Looks great

Food is passed around and shoveled on plates The Young
Woman notices that the mother’s big toe has no nail

MOTHER
So Jake tells us you’re a painter

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes Jake tells you correctly

FATHER
I don’t really know much about art
but I like pictures where you know
what you’re looking at

JAKE
(into his plate)
Dad For Christ’s sake

FATHER
What do you call it -- abstract --
I don’t get that I mean I could
do abstract smear paint on a what
is it called -- a canvas -- I
think it’s a con job if you ask
me I like paintings that look like
a photograph I couldn’t do one of
those in a million years That’s
talent

JAKE
Why not just take a photograph
Dad if you like photographs It’s
much quicker And photographs look
exactly like photographs

FATHER
I like photographs Mostly sports
photographs

MOTHER
(to young woman)
What kind of paintings do you make
Lucy

YOUNG WOMAN
Um Well I’m not an abstract
painter So that’s in my favor

FATHER
Good
(to no one in particular)
See That’s exactly my point
Good

YOUNG WOMAN
I do mostly landscapes

FATHER
Like outside paintings

YOUNG WOMAN

Yeah Plein Air Which is outdoor
painting I try to capture the feel
of the light and atmosphere

MOTHER
That sounds lovely Jake used to
paint too of course

JAKE
(into his plate)
Mom

MOTHER
He worked really hard at it

YOUNG WOMAN
I didn’t know that Jake

Jake doesn’t look up

MOTHER
He was very good

YOUNG WOMAN
I try to imbue my work with a kind
of interiority

FATHER
Interiority So you paint insides
I thought --

YOUNG WOMAN
Inside my head So a landscape
would attempt to express how I’m
feeling at the time lonely
joyous worried sad

MOTHER
That sounds very interesting Like
that painting of that girl sitting
in a field looking at a house

YOUNG WOMAN
Christina’s World Wyeth Yes
Exactly But without people

FATHER
How can a picture of a field be sad
without a sad person looking sad in
the field

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s an interesting problem
That’s what I struggle with I have
some pictures of my work if you’d
like to see

MOTHER
Oh yes

FATHER
Yeah sure

The Young Woman pulls out her phone sees that there have
been several calls from Louisa She ignores them opens up
her portfolio crosses the table places herself between the
Mother and Father and shows them her work The painting are
beautiful expressionistic vast lonely wintry landscapes

FATHER (CONTD)
I mean they’re pretty but I don’t
see how they’re supposed to make me
feel something if there’s not a
person in them feeling sad or
joyous or whatever other emotion
you said

YOUNG WOMAN
Maybe think of yourself as the
person looking out at the scene

FATHER
Id have to see me in them

YOUNG WOMAN
As if you’re there If you were
there you wouldn’t see yourself
right
48-48A

FATHER
I would if I looked down I’m not a
ghost Yet

The Father and the Mother laugh

MOTHER
I can attest to that Especially in
the bedroom

JAKE
Jesus

YOUNG WOMAN
Sure But if you were just looking
out at it without looking down
You’d just see the scene and feel
something Anything an environment
makes you feel is all about you and
not the environment right None
of the feeling is inherent to
place

FATHER
Well that’s over my head I guess

MOTHER
They are pretty though You’re very
talented I like the colors

YOUNG WOMAN
Thank you

MOTHER
Jake you didn’t tell us your
girlfriend is so talented

JAKE
(to his food)
I did actually
Pink Rev 48B

MOTHER
So Jake tells us you’re studying
physics at the university

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes
FATHER
That’s unusual for a girl isn’t
it

JAKE
Dad

FATHER
I’m just asking

YOUNG WOMAN
It is actually But a little less
so these days Which is good I
think

MOTHER
Well after seventh grade I could
never understand what Jake was
saying So it’s wonderful he has
someone he can talk to about all
his ideas

FATHER
Jake tells us there have been a lot
of famous husband and wife
physicists

JAKE
Jesus Dad

YOUNG WOMAN
I guess there have been some
Pierre and Marie Curie shared a
Nobel Prize in Physics

FATHER
Even I’ve heard of them Well her
anyway Radiation

I never heard of him though

MOTHER

MOTHER (CONTD)
I love romantic meeting stories
Like in Forget Paris Billy
Crystal

FATHER
I didn’t like that movie

The Young Woman looks over at Jake He stares down at his
plate She looks at the Mother who waits expectantly

She laughs

YOUNG WOMAN
Um so I went with a friend to a
bar near campus It turned out to
be trivia night

MOTHER
I love this so far Jake is crazy
about trivia We used to play the
genius edition of Trivial Pursuit

and --

JAKE
Genus

MOTHER
What

JAKE

It’s genus edition

MOTHER
Really I’ve always thought the
word was genius I’ve been saying
it wrong all these years It goes
to show
(punchline)
-- I’m no genus

- The Father laughs

FATHER
That’s a good one

JAKE
No Genus is not the same as
genius A genus is a category

MOTHER
Oh I always thought it was the
genius edition I told everybody
you knew every answer in the genius
edition I was very proud of that

Ha Yeah I did And very serious

about the game which I found -- I
don’t know -- charming His team
was called what

JAKE

Brehznev’s Eyebrows

YOUNG WOMAN
Right Brehznev’s Eyebrows I asked
him who Brehznev was Basically
because I wanted to say something
to him He told me Brehznev was a
Soviet engineer General

JAKE
- Secretary of the Communist
Party

YOUNG WOMAN
During the Age of Starvation

JAKE
Stagnation

YOUNG WOMAN
Stagnation Anyway those kind of
team names drive me nuts usually
They all have them those teams

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Show-offy But I don’t know it
didn’t bother me with Jake

(to Mother)
Maybe I just didn’t let it because
I thought he was cute

MOTHER
Aw He is cute isn’t he

YOUNG WOMAN
He is So I was trying to get up
the nerve to talk to him because
even though he had looked over at
me more than once it was clear he
was not going to say anything

FATHER
Didn’t you just say you talked
about Brehznev

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh Yes That’s true But then we
didn’t talk anymore after that I
guess is what I meant

FATHER
Oh

YOUNG WOMAN
So I said something stupid like
you guys seem to be doing well I
had to yell it practically it was
so noisy He held up his beer and
said We’re helpfully fortified
And I laughed and the ice was
broken I think he was egged on by
my laughing so he told me he is a
cruci

JAKE
verbalist

YOUNG WOMAN
I didn’t know what it meant But I
didn’t want to admit that so I
just said cool He was showing off
again and poorly but I guess I
thought ok this guy is awkward
He doesn’t have any game at all
There was something sort of
appealing about that But then it
kept going He said he had wanted
the team name to be Ipseity

(MORE)
Pink Rev YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
And I was like ugh now it’s
getting to be too much

MOTHER
You didn’t like him anymore

Jake looks over at the Young Woman

C53 OMITTED

YOUNG WOMAN
No I did I just wanted that stuff
to stop So I said I don’t know
that word and you know I don’t know
that word so why don’t you just
cut the crap He said something
like I’m an asshole I’m not very
good at talking to people and
ipseity is just another word for
selfhood Anyway after that he
just talked like a normal person
and he was funny And I could see
he wanted to ask for my number but
was shy Then my friend wanted to
go and so I was getting up and he
just blurted out could he have my
number

FATHER
Way to go Jake About time

YOUNG WOMAN
And I was very glad he did The
rest is history That was like
what six weeks ago I don’t know
Feels longer Feels like forever
in a way I can’t really remember
how long ago it is Feels like
forever

impressed that you try anyway”

The Mother shoots the father a look gets up and makes her
way to the kitchen touching his shoulder on the way

MOTHER
Help me I’1ll serve dessert in the
sitting room

There’s something in the way she says “help me” that isn’t a
casual plea for kitchen help He nods gets up and follows
her out of the room

The parents voices are raised in the other room some sort of
argument interspersed with the father singing bits of

Her eyes come to rest on a photo of a young girl The Young
Woman is startled

YOUNG WOMAN
Wait Who is this

JAKE
It’s me

And it is It’s Jake now in the same jeans and t-shirt the

as he sucked it

MOTHER
Yull log Kind of looks like a

thumb

The Mother cuts a too-thick slice plates it and hands it to
the young woman

YOUNG WOMAN
Thank you It really looks amazing

MOTHER
Enjoy

She continues to slice the cake and pass it out

FATHER

YOUNG WOMAN
No I know what she’s calling

JAKE
(oddly pointed)
You should at least listen to the
message

The Young Woman and Jake stare at each other for a long

moment

YOUNG WOMAN
Ok Sure

She puts the phone to her ear Jake watches her closely

MAN’S VOICE
There’s only one question to
resolve I’m scared I feel a
little crazy I’m not lucid The
assumptions are right I can feel
my fear growing Now is the time
for the answer Just one question
One question to answer

The message is over She puts the phone back in her purse

YOUNG WOMAN
She’s fine

What’d she want

YOUNG WOMAN
Just calling to say hi

It doesn’t get easier

MOTHER
What doesn’t

FATHER

It’s a fast train to Heck

The Father laughs
Yellow Rev 66

FATHER
Your mom was always funny That’s
what I loved about her I think
it’s what I first fell in love
with It kind of faded a bit as she
got older

MOTHER
That’s true You get worn down I
guess It’s not so funny anymore

FATHER
I miss her terribly

JAKE
So Lucia is studying gerontology

MOTHER
Oh really How fascinating

YOUNG WOMAN
I’ve always been interested in
problems associated with aging I
think our society has an almost
repulsed relationship to the aged
which is eminently foolish because
it’s a natural and inevitable part
of the life cycle of all living
things Not to mention it’s
terribly unkind

MOTHER
Well how interesting And
compassionate You’ve got a keeper
here Jake How kind she is

The Young Woman is looking out the window now The snow is
coming down hard and the wind is fierce

I know this bed is a little small
for two

(searches for word)

grown-ups It’s a child’s bed
after all And not even for twin
children just for one child But I
think for a single night you could
make do

YOUNG WOMAN
That’s very generous of you --

FATHER
I mean you won’t be doing any
fucking on this bed I imagine
It’s not made for fucking It’s a
childs bed And just for one
child Not two

YOUNG WOMAN
Right

The Father nods turns and limps from the room

I think I can find one of my wife’s
old things for you to wear for

Jake was always a good boy

JAKE
Mom

MOTHER
Diligent He won a pin Maybe not
as naturally talented as some of
the other students But he worked
so hard And that’s even more
impressive Being a genus is like
being beautiful

JAKE
Genius

MOTHER
Genius The luck of the draw
really the genetic lottery as
they say But to do as well as Jake
did with no special talent or
abilities that’s much more
impressive

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes

Maybe you should put the chains on

Jake starts I’m a pinball My
emotional state is bouncing all

needs to see me as someone who sees
him He needs to be seen and he
needs to be seen with approval
Like that’s my purpose in all this
in life To approve of Jake To
keep him going And he needs to
see me as someone whose approval of
him is validated because I’m
approved of by others Look at my
girlfriend Look at what I won
She’s smart She’s talented She’s
sensitive She can do this She
knows about that She made this
She cares about that

Yes Dad Louisa

Good I got your moms

He holds up a nightgown It has a post-it with the word
“nightgown” on it

FATHER (CONTD)
(reading)
nightgown for her

The Father with a Parkinsonian tremor holds out the
nightgown the Mother had just been wearing The Young Woman
takes it her hand touching some still-wet spilled baby food
She tries to hide her revulsion but Jake sees it reacts

YOUNG WOMAN
That’s very kind But I’m going to
have to head home tonight Soon

FATHER
I don’t understand
(to Jake)
What does she mean

JAKE
I don’t know Dad I can’t tell
exactly It’s not exactly clear

YOUNG WOMAN
I have my shift tomorrow

JAKE
She’s a waitress We met when she
was serving me It’s a sweet story
I asked her what she thought of the
Santa Fe burger --

FATHER
I’m feeling confused

Let’s just get you to the bathroom
We don’t want another accident

nightgown over the stairway banister and looks out the window
at the storm

What’s this old thing doing here

The Young Woman turns to see the Mother holding the
nightgown This is a very young version of the Mother (1950s
look)

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not sure

MOTHER

Oh my goodness It’s filthy It’s
got Jake’s baby food on it What’s
it doing here I tell you I would
misplace my own head if it wasn’t
screwed onto my shoulders

(laughs)
Would you be a sweetheart and toss
this in the washer I just started
a load My hands are full picking
up all these darn toys

She laughs Children’s toys are scattered around the room

MOTHER (CONTD)
Jake would leave his head on the
floor if it wasn’t screwed onto his
shoulders

YOUNG WOMAN
Sure Where is it

MOTHER
In the basement

She nods toward the scratched-up door

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t think Jake wants me down
there

MOTHER
Jake Jake Jake Jake can be
controlling You can’t allow him to
control you I think that’s the
other side of his type of
personality of this diligence
thing He needs to control
everything There are so many many
things that make him nervous that
he just keeps closing more and more
of the world off

Yellow Rev MOTHER (CONTD)
And the few people left in his life
have to follow all sorts of rules
It’s a problem

I’m sure I’m to blame but then all
that guilt just causes me to feel
obligated to bend over backwards to
accommodate his every little whim
It’s a vicious cycle

moment

YOUNG WOMAN
So what exactly are you saying to
me

MOTHER
(beat)
I’m saying take the damn nightgown

basement door The stairs are rickety and it’s dark There
is a bare bulb at the bottom of the stairs She heads down

INT FARMHOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 62

At the bottom she looks back up Jake is no longer in the
doorway which now seems to lead directly outside to the
storm Snow blows down the stairs She turns to the room
Dirt floors Scarred concrete walls An old washing machine
is bouncing and chugging She opens the lid watches the
dark sloshing water come to a stop the room turning silent
aside from the howling wind She stares down into the black
water After a moment she plunges her arm (sleeve and all)
into it fishes around and pulls out several dark green work
shirts featuring the name of a high school stitched above the
breast pocket one after another She puts them back throws
in the nightgown closes the lid The agitator resumes She
looks around the room A small easel is set up in the corner
with a crude landscape painting on it Taped to the wall
behind it are prints of the landscape paintings the Young
Woman had on her phone Printing on the bottom of the white
borders indicate these are 19th century paintings by Isaac
Levitan The painting on the easel is a terrible attempt to
copy one of the prints unskilled lifeless She sees a pile
of paintings and flips through them they are all miserable
attempts at copies They are all signed “Jake” She tries to
bring up her own paintings on her phone They are gone Her
phone rings again It is from Louisa She answers it

MAN’S VOICE
There’s only one question to
resolve I’m scared I feela

see Jake standing mournfully over his ancient mother clearly
dead lying on a hospital bed in the middle of the room

JAKE
Did you like them

YOUNG WOMAN
Theyre very nice
JAKE
Really

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes

JAKE
They can be a little pushy But
they’re basically decent people

YOUNG WOMAN
That was eminently clear

JAKE
Good
(beat)
They loved you by the way

YOUNG WOMAN
Good I’m glad

JAKE
So smart my mother said

YOUNG WOMAN
Did she

JAKE
Well not to you That would have
made you uncomfortable When I was
helping her with the dishes

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh

She stares out at the storm

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I don’t remember Jake helping his
mother with the dishes I feel
uncertain about a lot of what
happened tonight It seems as if
everything was slightly --

JAKE
When you and Dad were discussing --
What was it

YOUNG WOMAN
(suddenly recalling)
Tariffs

JAKE
Right tariffs

YOUNG WOMAN
I remember now I’m a little fuzzy

JAKE
You had a lot of wine He was
thrilled to have someone who knew --

YOUNG WOMAN
Did I

JAKE
You did I don’t think you noticed
because Dad kept topping you off

YOUNG WOMAN
Did he

JAKE
Oh yes

YOUNG WOMAN
Right I did notice that Tricky

JAKE
Makes it hard to keep count

YOUNG WOMAN
It does

JAKE
But all in all I think it was a
successful visit

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes

JAKE
Everyone got to know each other

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s true They’re very nice

JAKE
You liked them

YOUNG WOMAN
I did Yes

JAKE
Good They both liked you I think
that’s a good sign

YOUNG WOMAN
Sign

JAKE
Sign is perhaps not the right word
Thing A good thing

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh

JAKE
It’s good when people you like like
each other

Jake looks over at her for confirmation She nods without
back at him watches the snow in the headlights

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
People think of themselves as
points moving through time but I
think it’s probably the opposite
were stationary and time passes
through us blowing like cold wind
stealing our heat leaving us
chapped and frozen and -- I don’t
know -- dead I feel like I was
that wind tonight blowing through
Jakes parents seeing them as they
were seeing them as they will be
Seeing them after they’re gone
when only I’m left Only the wind

JAKE
What are you thinking

YOUNG WOMAN
Not much

JAKE
Really

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah I’m tired Jake The wine I
guess

JAKE
You did have a lot

YOUNG WOMAN

Yes

JAKE
Alcohol is a depressant as you
know So --

YOUNG WOMAN
Of course I know

JAKE
I think a person needs to keep that
in mind before making decisions
under its influence

YOUNG WOMAN
(chuckling)
A woman under the influence

JAKE
Amazing film

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not sure I agree I’ve been
watching it over and over for my
essay due Wednesday

JAKE
I mean I felt a kinship with
Mabel I guess She’s such a
powerful and horribly wronged
character

YOUNG WOMAN

Is she Hmm I think --

(beat)
Mabel Longhetti is bombed out
because she has always wanted to
please everyone so she can be
considered one more victim-heroine
for womens liberation -- but
only by womens liberationists who
are willing to accept textbook
spinoffs as art The Junoesque Gena
Rowlands (Mrs Cassavetes) is a
prodigious actress and she never
lets go of the character

JAKE
I agree I thought she was great in
the role It seemed to me she
encompassed this character as a
kind of spectrum of --

YOUNG WOMAN
Now at an indeterminate age when
her beauty has deepened beyond
ingénue roles Rowlands can look
old or young and shades of
expression transform Mabel
Longhetti from a radiantly
flirtatious beauty into a sad
sagging neighborhood drunk

(MORE )
YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Rowlands externalizes schizophrenic
dissolution Mabel fragments before
our eyes a three-ring circus might
be taking place in her face
Rowlands performance is enough for
half a dozen tours de force a
whole row of Oscars - its
exhausting Conceivably shes a
great actress but nothing she does
is memorable because she does so
much

(beat)

Its the most transient big
performance Ive ever seen

JAKE
I guess I’m unclear what you mean
by ‘transient”

The young woman considers this then

YOUNG WOMAN
Mabel tries to slash her wrist and
Nick puts a Band-Aid on the cut
the idiot symbolism may make you
want to hoot but this two-hour-and-
thirty-five-minute film leaves you
too groggy to do more than moan
Details that are meant to establish
the pathological nature of the
people around Mabel and so show
her isolation become instead limp
false moments We often can’t tell
whether the characters are meant to
be unconscious of what they’re
doing or whether it’s Cassavetes
who’s unconscious Mabel’s children
keep murmuring that they love her
and there are no clues to how to
decipher this refrain Are the
children coddling her-reversing
roles and treating her like a child
in need of reassurance Or are they
meant to be as unashamedly loving
as she is And what are we to make
of Nick the pulper’s constant
assertations --

JAKE
Is assertations even a word I
thought it was assertions

YOUNG WOMAN
It is They’re both words Look it
up
(continuing)

And what are we to make of Nick the
pulper’s assertations of love The
movie is entirely tendentious it’s
all planned yet it isn’t thought
out

Jake seems embarrassed How could he have liked this film

JAKE
I do see what you’re saying And
youre certainly the expert on
things cinematic

The Young Woman seems blurry confused somewhat startled by
her long-winded assessment of the movie

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah That I am

JAKE

I guess I was just taken in by the
sympathy Cassavetes showed for her
I feel like maybe our society lacks
a certain kindness a willingness
to take in the vulnerabilities and
struggles of others struggling
with issues caused by

YOUNG WOMAN
An alienating society

JAKE
I don’t know I guess yeah It
seems hopeless

YOUNG WOMAN
What does

JAKE
Everything It’s like feeling old
like your body is going your
hearing your sight You can’t see
and you’re invisible and you made
so many wrong turns The lie of it
all

YOUNG WOMAN
What’s the lie of it all
White Prod

Silence

Silence JAKE

I don’t know That things are
going to get better That it’s
never too late That good things
come to those who wait That God
has a plan for you That age is
just a number That it’s always
darkest before the dawn That every
cloud has a silver lining

(beat)
That there’s someone for everyone

YOUNG WOMAN
Platitudes all

JAKE
That God never gives us more than
we can bear

YOUNG WOMAN
Gods a good egg that way

JAKE
Hey do you feel like something
sweet

YOUNG WOMAN
What do you mean

JAKE
Something sweet Dessert

YOUNG WOMAN
Didn’t we have dessert at your
mom’s I feel like there was some
huge cake-thing she brought out and

JAKE
True I guess I’m a sugar junkie
I don’t know It might help me stay
awake

YOUNG WOMAN
Then definitely We need Jake awake
for a bit This is all so
treacherous

Yellow Rev JAKE
Good There’s a Tulsey Town just
at the turn-off up ahead

YOUNG WOMAN
(laughing)
A Tulsey Town Open now In this
It’s freezing

JAKE
(chuckling)
It is Perfect weather for a BURR
don’t you think

YOUNG WOMAN
Ha I guess it is

JAKE
(singing)
In the land of Tulsey Town we are
here to soft serve

YOUNG WOMAN
The land of Tulsey Town Jesus I
never thought about that before
What is the land of Tulsey Town do
you suppose

JAKE
Based on the clown it’s a circus
town Maybe like that place where
the sideshow folks go during the
off-season

YOUNG WOMAN
Ooh Ruled by the clown lady

JAKE
Well yes she wears a crown

YOUNG WOMAN
A clown crown

JAKE
A benevolent and tolerant ice cream
clown queen made entirely of
lactose

YOUNG WOMAN
She’s lactose tolerant

JAKE
Ha Yes She’s sweet but cold

YOUNG WOMAN
Like your mom

JAKE
What do you mean

YOUNG WOMAN
Nothing I don’t know why I said
that Just kind of came out

JAKE
Did you think of my mother as cold

YOUNG WOMAN
No She was lovely She really was

JAKE
Yeah I don’t subscribe to that
“the mother is cause of all
psychological problems” crap

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s misogynistic claptrap
Freudian bullshit

JAKE
Yeah It’s tempting to have someone
to pin it on though

YOUNG WOMAN
Pin what on

JAKE
All of it I don’t know Why you
feel a certain way why you are a
certain way

YOUNG WOMAN
But it’s misogynistic claptrap
Freudian bullshit A person an
adult has to at some point take
responsibility for who they are
what they’ve become Don’t you
think

JAKE
(beat)
I do

YOUNG WOMAN
Mothers are just people with their
own pain their own histories of
neglect and abuse

(MORE )

Yellow Rev 89

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Yet at one time or another in the
20th century every fucking
childhood trait was blamed on them
schizophrenia autism narcissism
homosexuality

JAKE
Not that homosexuality is akin to
any of those other things

YOUNG WOMAN
Of course not

JAKE
Saying that a mother is “to blame”
for her child’s homosexuality is to
imply that homosexuality is somehow
negative

YOUNG WOMAN
Of course And I didn’t mean that
But when homosexuality was
considered a pathology in the DSM
before 1973 a coddling mother was
often seen as the culprit

JAKE
Right It’s despicable how we label
people categorize them dismiss
them I look at the kids I see at
school every day I see the ones
who are ostracized They’re
different out of step I see the
lives they’1l have because of it
Sometimes I see them years later
in town or at the supermarket I
can tell they still carry that
stuff around with them Like a
black aura A mill stone An
oozing wound

The Young Woman watches him taking it in Silence

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
Jake I’m thinking of --

JAKE
Here Ta-dah
65pt2 EXT TULSEY TOWN - NIGHT 65pt2

She looks over to see that they have arrived at an old and
somewhat decrepit Tulsey Town
Yellow Rev 89A

It sits isolated open and glowing in the middle of the snow
storm surrounded by blackness

White Prod YOUNG WOMAN
Oh Wow The land of Tulsey Town

EXT TULSEY TOWN - JAKE’S CAR - NIGHT

The wind howls and the snow swirls as Jake and the Young
Woman emerge from the car

YOUNG WOMAN
Man It’s brutal

JAKE
Brutal place the land of Tulsey
Town Climate change here too
You ever read the novel Ice

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t think so

JAKE
By Anna Kavan

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t think so

JAKE
1967 It’s a fable of sorts about --

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t think so Let’s get the ice
cream and go I’m freezing

Jake peers into the Tulsey Town window The store seems
empty

JAKE
In a minute I want to see who’s
on tonight first

YOUNG WOMAN
On

JAKE
Working

YOUNG WOMAN
You know the people who work here

JAKE
Some of them I stop sometimes
after visiting my parents I don’t
like some of the girls who work
here so I want to make sure

White Prod 91

YOUNG WOMAN
What’s wrong with them

JAKE
Nothing I don’t know People can
be cold to me

YOUNG WOMAN
Well let’s do this or I’m waiting
in the car

She heads back to the car

JAKE
No

She looks at him

JAKE (CONTD)
(more softly)
Let’s stay

Jake knocks on the window --
There are no employees visible

JAKE (CONTD)
Say hello They won’t come if they
know it’s me

She eyes him then

YOUNG WOMAN
(calling)
Hello Anybody here

GIRL (0S)
In a minute

JAKE
So Ice takes place during an
environmental cataclysm that’s
caused the world to become a frozen
wasteland and --

Two girls who were seen among the high school students in
the play earlier emerge from the back They wear TT hats
and shirts still in their stage make-up They see the Young
Woman first then Jake who stands off to the side looking
sheepish

TT GIRL 1
Oh
White Prod 92

The two employees side-eye each other

TT GIRL 2
(mockingly polite)
Can we help you sir

Jake doesn’t say anything The Young Woman looks over at him
sees he is unable to speak The girls snicker

YOUNG WOMAN
Um
(looks at menu)
I’1l have a medium Chocolate
Chip Cookie Dough B-r-r-r and he’1l
have

She looks at Jake The Tulsey Town girls watch him
JAKE
(quietly)

Same

YOUNG WOMAN
Two of those please

The Tulsey Town girls eye each other and giggle

TT GIRL 2
Two “sames”

The Tulsey Town girls just stand there whispering to each
other and giggling as they side-eye Jake The Young Woman
watches them waiting confused

YOUNG WOMAN

So um sorry we need to get
back on the road so can we get
those --

Another uniformed girl emerges from the back and goes about
making the B-r-r-rs She is small and haunted Jake looks
down at his shoes

TT GIRL 3
Sorry for the smell they’re doing
some varnishing in the back

YOUNG WOMAN
Varnishing

TT GIRL 3
Shelves
Yellow Rev 93

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh Ok No problem

The Young Woman glances over at Jake He’s looking at the
haunted girl’s exposed arms which are covered with an eczema-
type rash The Young Woman follows his look and sees the

rash too The girl scratches mercilessly at her rash as she
makes the B-r-r-rs

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
I know this girl I’ve seen her
somewhere I’ve seen her before
Her face Her rash I know her
It’s on the tip of my tongue The
tip of my brain as Jake says
She’s someone She’s from
somewhere I’m certain of it

The girl turns from her task to the young woman

TT GIRL 3
(meekly)
It’s a fucking blizzard out there

The Young Woman is surprised by the girl’s choice of words
She takes a moment to formulate a response

YOUNG WOMAN
It is I was surprised you were
even open on a night like --

TT GIRL 3
Fucking blizzard out there fucking
B-r-r-rs in here

TT Girl 3 smiles apologetically for her attempt at a joke

YOUNG WOMAN
(supportively)
I was thinking the very same thing

TT GIRL 3
You’re kind Not like them
(indicating other girls)
Youre not like them Vapid and
mean and pretty

YOUNG WOMAN
Ha Thanks a lot

TT GIRL 3
(on the verge of tears)
I didn’t mean it like that
(MORE)
White Prod TT GIRL 3 (CONTD)
I love the way you look You have a
kindness And of course you’re very
attractive I didn’t mean it like
that

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s ok I understand

TT GIRL 3
I didn’t mean it like that It’s
just that there seems to be a
certain hardness that comes with
a certain kind of pretty You don’t
have that Maybe they suffer too
the pretty ones I don’t know
Maybe their prettiness causes them
suffering I’m not a psychiatrist

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
What an odd thing to say Of course
she’s not a psychiatrist She can’t
be more than fifteen

TT GIRL 3 holds the piled-high B-r-r-rs upside down then
places them right side up on the counter

TT GIRL 3
I made them extra high Because
you’re so nice
(beat)
That’1ll be eight dollars please

Jake hands her a ten The Young Woman notices that Jake has a
similar rash on his hand Tulsey Town Girl 3 puts the money
in the register and gives the change to the Young Woman

The Young Woman looks around

YOUNG WOMAN
You keep the change

TT GIRL 3
(to Young Woman)
Thank you

YOUNG WOMAN
You’re welcome Thank you

TT GIRL 3
I’m worried

confused No one else

is paying

attention The other girls are giggling Jake is at the door
looking at the storm
White Prod 95

YOUNG WOMAN
Excuse me

TT GIRL 3
I shouldnt be saying this I know
what happens It’s not good

YOUNG WOMAN
(looking at other girls)
Are you ok Do you need me to call
for help

TT GIRL 3
It’s not varnish That’s not why it
smells You should know that

YOUNG WOMAN
What do you mean

TT GIRL 3
You don’t have to go

The other two employees are whispering and giggling

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t have to go where

TT GIRL 3
Forward In time You don’t have
to You can stay here
(beat)
I’m very scared

YOUNG WOMAN
Of what What are you scared of

TT GIRL 3
I’m scared for you

Jake looks over TT Girl 3 changes her tone
TT GIRL 3 (CONTD)
Have a good night Be careful out
there The roads are treacherous
67pt1 INT CAR - NIGHT 67pt1

Jake drives They pick at their B-r-r-rs

JAKE
Any good
YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah It’s fine It’s good

They eat in silence

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Did you notice that girl’s arms

JAKE
Which girl

YOUNG WOMAN
At the Tulsey Town

JAKE
(containing impatience)
Which girl There were several

YOUNG WOMAN
Several There were three

JAKE
(beat)
Several is anything more than two

YOUNG WOMAN
Really

JAKE
Look it up

YOUNG WOMAN

Look it up Now Will you stop
saying that Anyway the skinny
one

JAKE
Weren’t they all skinny

YOUNG WOMAN
You are being willfully obtuse

JAKE
Not my intention

YOUNG WOMAN
(mockingly)
Not my intention

The one with the rash all over her
arms

White Prod

Silence

Silence

Jake has

Silence

She turns

She looks JAKE
(beat)
I didn’t notice

YOUNG WOMAN
Ok Anyway

JAKE
How’s the Burr Too sweet

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s sweet yes But it’s good

placed his B-r-r-r in the cup holder

JAKE
I always forget how sweet these
are A little goes a long way I
don’t think I can eat any more of
mine

YOUNG WOMAN
You barely touched it

JAKE
It’s very sweet

YOUNG WOMAN
It is a lot

up the heat

JAKE
Cold

YOUNG WOMAN
Probably the ice cream

JAKE
And we’re in a snowstorm Whose
idea was it to go to Tulsey Town in
the middle of this anyway

over at him

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m not saying a word

It’s melting

They both laugh She looks out at the storm which has an
otherworldly quality to it

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
How odd This is probably the last
time I’ll ever be in a car with
Jake Soon this will all be a
distant memory We’1ll both be in
different places remembering this
moment this shared laugh And
maybe therell be regret Maybe
time will soften the harder edges
and we’ll both think that was sort
of nice Why did it have to end
And there’s no way back at that
point There’s never a way back
Maybe it doesn’t need to end Why
am I putting so much pressure on
this to be some bullshit out of a
movie Maybe I will eventually fall
in love with Jake Maybe it will
get better Relationships take
effort Anyone in a successful
relationship will always tell you --

JAKE
You got quiet all of a sudden
Penny

YOUNG WOMAN
Just watching the storm

JAKE
Huh

Silence

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
But if you can’t even tell the
other person what you’re thinking
that doesn’t bode well

Jake looks back and forth several times from the road to the
Young Woman trying to read her mood She stares straight
ahead watching the storm in the headlights

JAKE
Looks like you’re done with it

YOUNG WOMAN
(looking at him)
What do you mean
White Prod 99

He gestures to the two B-r-r-rs sitting in the cup holders
and melting down their sides

JAKE
Me too

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m a little cold I guess

JAKE
A bit of a wasted stop

YOUNG WOMAN
At least I can say I’ve been to a
Tulsey Town in the middle of
nowhere in the middle of the night
in the middle of a snowstorm

JAKE

(singing)
I’m your favorite clownfrom Tulsey
Townwhere ice cream grows on
treesSo have no fearcome and join
me hereand eat as much as you
pleaseI will turn your frownfully
upside downwhen you take your very
first biteof vanilla chocolate
or strawberryWe’re open day and

night
YOUNG WOMAN
(chuckles)
And it’s something I’1l never do
again
JAKE
A Supposedly Fun Thing You’ll Never
Do Again

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes Exactly

JAKE
Have you read that

YOUNG WOMAN
Read what

JAKE
It’s a book of essays by David
Foster Wallace

YOUNG WOMAN
I have not
JAKE
A book of essays

YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh No I haven’t read it

JAKE

We should find a place to dump
these They’re going to melt and
get the cup holders all sticky

YOUNG WOMAN
Um Ok

JAKE
He’s got an essay in it about
television “One of the things that
makes the people on TV fit to stand
the mega-gaze is that they are by
human standards really pretty I
suspect that this like most
television conventions is set up
with motive no more sinister than
to appeal to the largest possible
Audience Pretty people tend to be
more pleasing to look at then non-
pretty people But when we’re
talking about television the
combination of sheer Audience size
and quiet psychic intercourse
between images and oglers starts a
cycle that both enhances pretty
images’ appeal and erodes us
viewers’ own security in the face
of gazes Because of the way humans
relate to narrative we tend to
identify with those characters we
find appealing We try to see
ourselves in them The same ID-
relation however also means that
we try to see them in ourselves
When everybody we seek to identify
with for six hours a day is pretty
it naturally becomes more important
for us to be pretty to be viewed
as pretty”

(beat)
That’s from the essay

YOUNG WOMAN
Huh

JAKE
There’s a lot more but I won’t
bore you

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s interesting Kinda long-
winded

JAKE
He killed himself

YOUNG WOMAN
Yes I think I knew that

JAKE

Everybody knows it Even people who
know nothing else about David
Foster Wallace have never read a
word of his writing Suicide
becomes the story The mythology
The cautionary tale It’s
obnoxious Other people’s suffering
turned into stories They made a
movie about him Based on a
bestselling book published two
years after he killed himself

YOUNG WOMAN
Huh

JAKE
Neither of which would have existed
had he not killed himself

YOUNG WOMAN
Yeah

JAKE
I don’t think we know how to be
human anymore

YOUNG WOMAN
Who doesn’t

JAKE
Our society Our culture People
Whatever all this is Any of us

YOUNG WOMAN
Have you ever read any Guy DeBord
The Society of the Spectacle

JAKE
Exactly Yes Of course

Silence

YOUNG WOMAN
DeBord says “The society cannot be
understood as a mere visual
deception produced by mass-media
technologies It is a worldview
that has actually been
materialized”

JAKE
Exactly We watch the world
through this glass pre-interpreted
for us It infects our brains We
become it

YOUNG WOMAN
A virus

JAKE
Listen these melting things are
driving me crazy It’s going to
get everything all sticky

YOUNG WOMAN
Do you have a plastic bag I can put
them in Some napkins maybe

JAKE
No Nothing like that I want to
find some place to dump them

YOUNG WOMAN
There doesn’t seem to be anything
around here

JAKE
There’s a small road up ahead I
know of There’1ll be a garbage can

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t know Maybe we should just
head home

JAKE
(confused)
To the farm

YOUNG WOMAN
What No To the city I’m worried
about getting stuck out here If we
turn off the main road and get
stuck no one will find us

JAKE
Yeah True

Silence

JAKE (CONTD)
I’m just not going to feel right if
I don’t get rid of these It’1l
prey on my mind Shit I should’ve
brought napkins And a plastic bag
Like you said That was really
stupid A plastic bag would’ve
solved everything

YOUNG WOMAN
Not everything

Jake pounds at the steering wheel The Young Woman watches

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
It’s not a big deal Really

JAKE
Yes I know that Ames

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
Ames Is that short for Amy That
doesn’t sound right That doesn’t
seem like my name Or my nickname

JAKE
Just let’s go here real quick

Jake turns off onto a narrow dirt road -- almost a path --
bordered by tall dark trees

JAKE (CONTD)
And Ill get to show you my high
school

YOUNG WOMAN
This goes to a high school

JAKE
Yes My high school Where I went
every tortured day for so long So
goddamn long
(beat)
I did not like high school

YOUNG WOMAN
(worried)
No one did really

JAKE
That’s what they tell me I am told
that

YOUNG WOMAN
It’s true

JAKE
I see people who seem to thrive
there

YOUNG WOMAN
This road goes to a high school

JAKE
Yeah Why

YOUNG WOMAN
I don’t know It seems so -- It
doesn’t seem like a road at all

JAKE
What does it seem like

YOUNG WOMAN
Hmm A path A trail
The road less travelled

JAKE
Well it is a bit Frosty out

YOUNG WOMAN
(chuckling)
Fired

JAKE
Just trying to lighten the mood

YOUNG WOMAN
And that has made all the
difference

JAKE
(chuckling)
Now who’s fired

Silence

YOUNG WOMAN
I do feel uneasy Jake I think we
should turn back It doesn’t feel
right

JAKE
It’s just a high school

YOUNG WOMAN
It feels wrong

JAKE
Anyway I can’t turn around The
road’s too narrow I’1ll just get to
the school dump the cups and
well leave

YOUNG WOMAN
Ok

JAKE
Good

YOUNG WOMAN
I just don’t really get this This
road makes no sense to me How do
school buses get down here

JAKE
It’s a rural high school

YOUNG WOMAN
Jake I grew up on a farm I went
to a rural high school We had a
normal entrance with a paved road

JAKE
It’s fine It’1ll be fine
Everything is tinged That’s the
thing you have to realize

YOUNG WOMAN
Tinged

JAKE
Colored By mood By emotion By
past experience There is no
objective reality You know there
is no color in the universe right
Only in our brains Just
electromagnetic frequencies The
brain tinges them

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m a physicist I know what color
is

JAKE
Yes You are You do

YOUNG WOMAN
(beat)
Colors are the deeds of light its
deeds and suffering

JAKE
That’s beautiful Not physicist
talk but eminently poetic

YOUNG WOMAN
Well I am a poet after all

JAKE
Yes you are It’s beautiful

YOUNG WOMAN
This road seems excessively long

JAKE
Seems That’s the operative word
Time another thing that exists
only in the brain

YOUNG WOMAN
And yet we get older

JAKE
Older and older Or so it seems
Sometimes I feel I am much younger
than I actually am Like still a
kid inside Until I pass a mirror

YOUNG WOMAN
Is younger better

JAKE
(quickly confidently)
Yes
(beat)
I think so It’s admirable

YOUNG WOMAN
Youth is admirable How can you
admire a person for their age
Itd be like admiring a specific
point in a stream

JAKE
It’s healthier brighter more
fun More attractive Hopeful

YOUNG WOMAN
Like a Coca Cola commercial
Yellow Rev 107

JAKE
Almost all ground-breaking work in
science in the arts is done by
young people Old people are the
ash heap of youth

YOUNG WOMAN
Listen Jake I’m thinking we need

to end --
JAKE
Tah-dah

There
Yellow Rev 107A

YOUNG WOMAN

JAKE
Trash can I knew it
(grabbing cups)
Ill be right back

He opens his door exits the car slams the door The Young
Woman starts at the violence of the slam She watches Jake as
he trudges struggling against the wind toward the
receptacle It’s slow going Snow falls on the windshield
obscuring Jake Then he is revealed again by the scraping
windshield wipers Obscured revealed obscured revealed He
arrives at the bin opens the lid and just stands there
peering in

YOUNG WOMAN
What is he doing Jake c’mon
let’s go

She glances over at the pick-up truck Jake places the lid
back on he’s still holding the cups

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
What are you doing Argh

He looks toward the car holds one finger up to indicate “one
minute” and trudges off disappearing behind the school

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
What Jesus Jake

She reaches over to the driver’s side and locks the car
doors looks behind her into the blackness She glances at
the truck somehow made sinister by the lot’s sodium vapor
lamps

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Ugh

For a long while she watches the corner around which Jake
has disappeared She seems to be willing him to reappear
Eventually he does

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Yes Let’s go let’s go let’s go
let’s go

He waves and trudges toward the car obscured revealed
obscured revealed He arrives at the car opens the door

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Where were you

Jake gets in closes the door He is covered in snow out of
breath

JAKE
Sorry Sorry That bin was filled
with road salt For the ice I
remembered there was a dumpster on
the other side near the loading
dock So mission accomplished

YOUNG WOMAN
Good Let’s go

JAKE
It’s humid in here

His glasses are fogged He turns the ignition key the engine
stops

JAKE (CONTD)
There
(beat)
Kind of peaceful no

YOUNG WOMAN
More creepy than peaceful I’d say

JAKE
I don’t agree

YOUNG WOMAN
I want to go

JAKE
What’s the rush all of a sudden

YOUNG WOMAN
All of a sudden All night I’ve
been a broken record about getting
home I’ve given you like forty
reasons I need to get home tonight

JAKE
I guess that’s true

YOUNG WOMAN
You guess

JAKE
I just thought you know since
it’s peaceful and quiet here and
Baby it’s cold outside --

YOUNG WOMAN
Really You’re going to quote a
rape song at me to convince me to --
Yellow Rev 110

JAKE
It’s not a rape song

YOUNG WOMAN
She keeps saying she wants to
leave He keeps ignoring her What
would you call that

JAKE
She wants to stay She’s just
afraid of what people will think

YOUNG WOMAN
She asks him “What did you put in
my damn drink”

JAKE
Jesus the song was written in
1936 It’s not about roofies

YOUNG WOMAN
Roofies or not he’s trying to
break down her defenses with strong
liquor And anyway I’m sorry
but they had mickeys in the
thirties It’s a song about
coercion

JAKE
Why are you getting so angry

YOUNG WOMAN
(beat)
I just want to go home

JAKE
To the farmhouse

YOUNG WOMAN
No Not to the fucking farmhouse
To my house Jake To my house

JAKE
Ok ok

He turns the ignition key The car starts He waits for the
wipers to clear the snow from the windshield

YOUNG WOMAN
Thank you

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Yknow he says “What’s the point
of hurting my pride” Like it’s
her job to make this guy feel
sexually attractive
(MORE)

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Regardless of her own desires
That’s not her responsibility

JAKE
I see that You’ve convinced me
I’m sorry

He leans over to give her a conciliatory kiss which she
accepts The kiss turns a bit romantic Jake suddenly pulls
away

JAKE (CONTD)
Jesus

YOUNG WOMAN
What

JAKE
In the window

YOUNG WOMAN
(looking toward school)
What

JAKE
There was someone watching us

YOUNG WOMAN
(scanning windows)
I don’t see anyone

JAKE
He was there Watching us Like a
goddamn pervert

YOUNG WOMAN

Let’s go Maybe he was just looking
out the window wondering what our
car was doing here in the middle of
the night

JAKE
Believe me I am very familiar with
that particular look

YOUNG WOMAN
What does that mean

JAKE
I’m going to give him a piece of my
mind is what it means That is not
acceptable
Jake turns off the car opens the door and exits car

YOUNG WOMAN
Jake really let’s just --

JAKE
Ill be right back This is not
acceptable

YOUNG WOMAN
Jake

JAKE
At all

He slams the door and is gone running toward the school
The Young Woman shivers looks at the ignition The key is

missing

YOUNG WOMAN
Crap

She sits there shivering watching Jake recede Soon he is

around the corner and gone
school turns and looks back at the road
her seat puts her hands in her pockets and waits

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
This was a mistake I shouldn’t
have come I knew things between
Jake and me were not going to work
out I think if I’m honest I knew
from our very first conversation
There was something Something
needling In the back of my brain
Some little voice whispering this
isn’t right This isn’t for you
Turn back But it’s hard to say no
I was never taught that It’s
easier to say ok It’s smoother
Feathers don’t get ruffled People
don’t get hurt And anyway
sometimes you’re caught off-guard
The request comes can I have your
number And the easiest way out is
to say yes And that yes leads to
the next yes and then more yes
yes yes yes yes and then you
find yourself in a relationship
And it’s too late to say no or at
least it has become much harder
Because you don’t have a good
reason He’s not a monster He
doesn’t beat you

(MORE )

The Young Woman watches the
settles back into

YOUNG WOMAN (VO) (CONTD)

He’s a nice guy and now you need a
reason But you fantasize about
being rid of it the whole thing
And none of it is fair to him this
constant unspoken pulling away And
you shouldve just said no thank
you in the first place But he’s a
nice guy and I imagine we’ve had
some fun I’m sure we have I’m
certain we’ve laughed I’m certain
the sex has been good at least
some of the time It has to have
been although right now I have
very little actual memory of it
Right now the whole thing seems
vague All this time together and I
can’t feel it Where did it go

(trying to see through

windshield)
Where did Jake go

The windshield is obscured she opens the door pokes her
head out looks into the distance searching for his figure
amidst the swirling snow She gets back in closes the door
locks it

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)

I’m so cold Where is he And how
long does it take to get
hypothermia Maybe it’s not a bad
way to go if you have to go
Numbness has its advantages
Sometimes it’s the only way to get
through Just turn it all off all
the damn signals to the brain all
the noise all the time

(beat)
Slow it down

(beat)
Slow it slow it until it all just
stops

The Young Woman sits there in silence shivering staring at
the quiet school

YOUNG WOMAN
Jesus Jake C’mon

She sighs opens the car door exits closes the door
immediately realizes tries the door it’s locked behind her

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Shit Shit
Yellow Rev 114

She tries all the other doors All locked

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Shit shit shit

She looks at the school heads toward it As she walks she
stares up at the school’s darkened windows she looks behind
her she looks at the pick-up truck in the parking lot She
feels she’s being watched through every black rectangle She
becomes self-conscious and incongruously as she walks
through the snow and wind she attempts to fix her blowing
hair She rounds the corner and sees the dumpster Jake had
mentioned She approaches it opens the lid It is filled
with hundreds of half-eaten B-r-r-rs The Young Woman is
startled jumps back the lid slams closed with a metal clang
that echoes off the building She makes her way to the
school’s glass front doors peers in a long dim empty
hallway She doesn’t know what to do she’s scared to go in
she’s too cold to stay outside She rests her forehead
against the glass of the door for a long moment

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
(to herself)
Jake Please

She girds herself enters the building

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT 69

The Young Woman walks cautiously down the hall The shot
mirrors the initial shot of the Janitor walking the same
hall

YOUNG WOMAN
(quietly)
Jake

The Janitor appears in the distance at the end of the hall
where it intersects with another He is mopping seems
unaware of her She gasps and hides in a doorway Breathing
hard she peeks back down the hall the Janitor is gone

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
(quietly)
Jake I want to go Please

She steps back out into the hall The Janitor appears again
in the intersecting hall now mopping in the other direction
Again the Young Woman jumps back into the doorway

YOUNG WOMAN (VO)
What am I doing here This entire
night makes no sense I’ve lost
myself in all of this in this
relationship in this world of
Jake How is it one always finds
oneself in a foreign country in
relationships In the land of Jake
We treat you right

(looking toward entrance)
Maybe he’s back out in the car
Can he have passed without me
seeing him I don’t think so He
has to be in here somewhere And
even if he is out there he
wouldn’t leave without me He’d
come looking for me I’ll wait in
the warmth out of sight Watching
For Jake Is it possible that the
janitor guy has done something to
him Hurt him somehow If he’s hurt
Jake -- killed him even -- what
chance is there for me I’1ll just
wait Till morning if I have to
Till the school opens

(beat)

Unless it’s a snow day It’s going
to be a snow day tomorrow isn’t
it Of course it is It’s going to
be a snow day tomorrow and nobody
is coming Shit Jake Ok Still
In daylight I can walk to the road
There’1ll be somebody A snowplow A
cop I’1l just sit tight Unseen

She peeks down the hall

The hall is now seen from the Janitor’s POV He has spotted
the Young Woman’s head poking out She sees him pulls out of
sight He mops toward her slow methodically deliberately
mumbling to himself The mumbling for the first time can
partially be made out

JANITOR
Don’t Don’t You can’t

The Janitor continues toward her drawn like a magnet

JANITOR (CONTD)
Don’t No Mustn’t

He arrives at the doorway in which she hides He stops
seemingly unable to make the final step to see her Her
breathing is audible

Finally he pokes his head around the locker She is looking
at him (at us) no recognition on her face

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh Hello I’m sorry My
boyfriend I think he came in
here I think he went to school
here A while back So maybe you
know him I don’t know if you were
here when he was a student How
would I know Anyway I’m locked
out of his car So I came in
looking for him -- I hope that’s ok
-- But I didn’t see him So I’m
waiting here but I can go if
that’s not all right You haven’t
seen anyone in here by any chance
have you I’m a little worried
You haven’t seen him have you

Silence Then

JANITOR
What does your boyfriend look like

YOUNG WOMAN
Um It’s so hard to describe
people Anyway it’s so long ago
I barely remember We never even
talked is the truth I’m not sure
I even registered him There were a
lot of people I was there with my
girlfriend She and I were
celebrating our anniversary
Stopped in for a drink and this guy
kept looking over at me It’s a
nuisance The occupational hazard
of being female You can’t even go
out for a drink Always being
looked at A creeper you know I
remember thinking I wish my
boyfriend were here which is sort
of sad that if you’re a woman
guys don’t leave you alone unless
youre with another guy like
youve been claimed like you’re
property Even then not always
Anyway I can’t remember what he
looked like Why would I Nothing
happened He was just one of
thousands of such non-interactions
in my life

(MORE)

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)

It’s like asking me if I can
describe the mosquito that bit me
on a certain evening forty years
ago

(beat)
So have you seen someone fitting
that description

JANITOR
I haven’t seen anyone

YOUNG WOMAN
Ok

JANITOR
I mean other than you I see you

YOUNG WOMAN
(beat)
I’m worried about him

JANITOR
I’m sure there’s no need He’s safe
if he’s here It’s safe in here
Quiet

YOUNG WOMAN
(studies his face)
Ok
(beat)
Is it ok if I look around for him

JANITOR
Maybe take your wet shoes off I’ve
just cleaned the floors

YOUNG WOMAN
Thanks

The Young Woman takes off her shoes The Janitor watches her
feet now in the big blue slippers She smiles back at him
briefly sadly

YOUNG WOMAN (CONTD)
Bye

JANITOR
Yeah Bye

The Young Woman pads silently down the hall her voice
receding

YOUNG WOMAN
Jake Jake Jake

The Janitor mops up the small puddles left by the Young
Woman’s shoes

INT HIGH SCHOOL —- HALLWAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT 70

The Young Woman arrives at the hall intersection stands
still and looks down it Jake is in the distance looking at
her A Second Young Woman dressed identically to the Young
Woman emerges from another classroom doorway and stands
behind her A Young Man dressed as Jake emerges and stands
behind Jake The real Jake and Young Woman back away leaving
only their replacements Eerie burbling orchestral music
begins vague and poorly remembered The two replacements
wave and hurry toward each other in a balletic run They meet
in the middle of the hall and embrace “Jake” spins “Young
Woman” around lifts her and the two perform a pas de deux
expressing their love The real Jake watches profoundly
moved and the real Young Woman looks perplexed and anxious
The dance continues as a wedding ceremony is performed and
the “Young Woman” walks down the school hall towards “Jake”
and a “Minister” The Janitor appears intercepts the “Young
Woman” and pulls her away from the ceremony She escapes
down a surreal dark hall and ends up “outside” in a
stylized version of the school exterior struggling against
the snow and wind the Janitor in pursuit He grabs her and
she fights to disengage “Jake” appears in the storm and
the Janitor and “Jake” engage in a balletic fight ending
when the Janitor pulls out a knife and stabs “Jake” leaving
him to die on the ground with bright red silk scarves
spilling out around him on the snow The Janitor grabs the
“Young Woman” and carries her away leaving the actual Young
Woman Jake and dying “Jake” Jake and the Young Woman look
at each other with resignation and walk off into the storm in
opposite directions soon becoming obscured by the blowing
snow

The Janitor’s POV through which all this has been
experienced He wheels his cart toward the body of “Jake”
lifts it places it and the red scarves in the trash
receptacle on the cart and wheels it off

INT SCHOOL - NIGHT 71

Various shot of the Janitor cleaning now in silence
punctuated by the occasional distant call of “Jake” These
become fewer and farther between and even more distant
Eventually the calls cease

INT JANITOR’S CLOSET - NIGHT 72

The Janitor changes his shirt collects his thermos puts on
his jacket
Yellow Rev 119

EXT SCHOOL - NIGHT 73

The Janitor trudges toward his truck in the empty parking
lot The truck is covered with snow He glances over to
where Jake’s car had been parked it is gone He unlocks the
trucks door dumps his stuff on the passenger seat pulls
out a scraper brushes the snow off his windows gets in the
truck closes the door

INT TRUCK - NIGHT 74

The Janitor pulls his ignition key from his pocket brings it
to the ignition hesitates doesn’t insert it puts it back
in his pocket watches the snow fall Gradually it begins to
fall in a sort of time-lapse loop otherworldly The
windshield gets covered with a thin layer of snow still
allowing the light from the parking lot through casting the
inside of the cab into yellow dimness The Janitor shivers
The cab gets darker as more snow accumulates His shivering
becomes more violent turns into a jerky timelapse He rips
off his gloves his hat wipes his brow With thick now
clumsy hands struggles to unbutton his shirt succeeds
tears it off Pulls off his boots his socks his pants his
underwear He is now naked in the ever dimming cab The snow-
covered windshield begins to sizzle and percolate like TV
screen “snow” This jitteriness turns to maggots which fall
away to reveal a suffering pig who turns his head and
acknowledges the Janitor with sorrowful eyes The pig turns
away and walks slowly toward the school He looks back at
the Janitor urging him to follow The Janitor gets out of
the truck and walks naked behind the pig His body shakes
with cold

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT 75

The Janitor follows the pig who on occasion looks back as
he walks The pig talks to the Janitor

PIG
It’s not bad Once you stop feeling
sorry for yourself because you’re
just a pig or even worse a pig
infested with maggots Someone has
to be a pig infested with maggots
right It might as well be you
It’s the luck of the draw You play
the hand you’re dealt You make
lemonade You move on You don’t
worry about a thing

JANITOR
That song has always made me cry

PIG
I’ve always loved it There is
kindness in the world y’know You
have to search for it but it’s
there

JANITOR
You’re kind

PIG
Eh I’m just evolving Even now
even as a ghost as a memory as
dust As you will

JANITOR
We’re the same

PIG
Everything is the same When you
look close enough As a physicist
you would know that You me
ideas We’re all one thing Let’s
get you dressed

JANITOR
But I’m so hot

PIG
Heat cold Variations on a theme
It’s not important

The pig leads the Janitor now dressed in tails into the
auditorium a Nobel medallion around his neck

INT AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT 76

The Janitor steps onto the stage The Oklahoma set is there
looking very much like Jake’s farmhouse His mother the
young version dressed like Aunt Eller in grease paint old
age make-up sits in a rocking chair on the porch of the
house She smiles at him The Janitor looks from her to the
audience which is filled with high school students now
dressed in tuxes and gowns They applaud enthusiastically
The Young Woman also in old age grease paint is in the
audience too smiling up lovingly at him His Father the
Tulsey Town girls Jake all there

JANITOR

In the audience young Jake mouths along with this

JANITOR (CONTD)
-- the metaphysical the delusional

most important discovery of my
life It is only in the mysterious
equations of love --

In the audience the Young Woman watches adoringly

JANITOR (CONTD)
-- that any logic or reasons can be
found I am only here tonight
because of you You are the reason
I am You are all my reasons
Thank you

The Young Woman is moved to tears The Janitor sings now
dressed like a farmer A stage set of a shack interior is
rolled in behind him It bears a striking resemblance to
Jake’s bedroom

JANITOR (CONTD)
The floor creaksthe door
squeaksthere’s a field mouse a-
nibblin on a broomAnd I sit by
myselfLike a cobweb on a shelfBy
myself in a lonely roomBut when
there’s a moon in my winderAnd it
slants down a beam crost my
bedThen the shadder of a
treestarts a-dancin on the
wallAnd a dream starts a dancin in
my headAnd all the things I wish
ferTurn out like I wanted them to
beAnd all the things I wish
ferTurn out like I want them to
beAnd I’m better’n that smart
aleck cowhandWho thinks he’s
better’n meAnd The girl that I
wantAin’t afraid of my armsAnd
her own soft arms keep me warmAnd
her long tangled hair falls a-crost
my faceJist like the rain in a
stormThe Floor creaks the door
squeaksAnd the field mouse starts
a-nibblin on the broomAnd the sun
flicks my eyesIt was all a pack of
liesI’m awake in a lonely roomI
ain’t gonna dream about her no
moreI Ain’t gonna leave her
aloneGoin’ outsideGit myself a
brideGit me a woman to call my
own

The Janitor finishes and is met with passionate extended
applause He stands there for an uncomfortably long time
taking it in

EXT SCHOOL - MORNING 77
The storm has stopped Silence The sun is shining The
ground is covered in drifts of snow In the empty parking
lot sits the Janitor’s pick-up a white truck-shaped lump of

snow
