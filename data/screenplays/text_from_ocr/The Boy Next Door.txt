EXT EVANSTON ILLINOIS - DAWN - AERIAL VIEW

A DEEP RAVINE slashes through a wooded area that stretches
for miles behind picturesque homes

Through the treetops we glimpse a FEMALE RUNNER on a trail

EXT WOODS - TRAIL - DAWN

MUDDY RUNNING SHOES pound a dirt path We travel up toned legs
and a trim frame to A FACE -- classically beautiful but set hard
with determination

This is CLAIRE PETERSON 39 though she could pass for years
younger if she’d only lighten up a bit

She speeds up as she approaches a FALLEN SYCAMORE that blocks
her path With the grace of a gazelle she leaps over the
downed tree and lands in

A CLEARING

poised on the brink of the ravine Quiet Mossy A sylvan
paradise complete with a TIRE SWING hanging from a tree

Claire breathes heavily as she stretches against the fallen
sycamore Eventually her gaze wanders to a WEATHERED CARVING
on its trunk “CP GP” encircled in a heart

Her eyes darken

Her watch BEEPS pulling her back to the present She
hurries off toward a COLONIAL-STYLE HOME in the distance

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Claire dressed in a prim skirt and blouse bustles about
clearing the breakfast table

A NEWSCAST plays on a small TV but Claire doesn’t pay much
attention to it

her belongings and goes out the door

INT PETERSON HOUSE - ADJOINING GARAGE - MORNING

Claire enters from the house juggling her things She
pushes the GARAGE DOOR OPENER on the wall but the massive
wooden door doesn’t budge She pushes it again Nothing

CLAIRE
Oh not today

She sets her things down and lifts the door manually
struggling under its weight But it immediately rolls back
down accompanied by a sprinkling of drywall

CLAIRE
Damn it
KEVIN PETERSON gangly Elmer’s glue complexion emerges
from the house laggige a backpack and a CELLO CASE He

surveys the scene and reaches for his cell phone

Claire maneuvers through the parking lot where EXCITED TEENS
greet each other after a long summer apart

laughing with girlfriends Claire notices his eyes following
her as they drive past

Claire starts to turn into a parking space when an acne-scarred
tough-guy JASON ZIMMER 18 steps into her path rough-housing
with some boys

Kevin shrinks at the sight of Jason Claire waits for him to
pass then parks

watches him disappear in her mirror then gets out

On a large screen she projects a DRAWING of ancient Greeks
forcing a man into a large HOLLOW BRASS BULL

CLAIRE
This my friends is the brazen bull
A little torture device conjured up by
the ancient Greeks to roast criminals
alive And just to amp up the creepy
factor they put a network of pipes
inside so the victim’s screams would
sound like the bellowing of an
infuriated bull

VARIOUS STUDENTS
Eeewww Disgusting Awesome

CLAIRE
They were pretty sick and twisted
back then Lucky for us they
wrote about it

She sits on her desk and makes eye contact with each of them

I’m probably going to return them

the shoe from him and shoves it back in the box

What Tell me

NOAH
It’s just that some women don’t need
this kind of thing to be desirable

Claire laughs her face flushing with embarrassment

NOAH
I’m no expert or anything but I’ve
always thought true sex appeal is
intangible Something that comes from
inside Women like Vicky try to be sexy
by wearing things like thi But it’s
really all just smoke and mirrors

CLAIRE
Plenty of men seem to go for that

Plenty of men are idiots Any guy
who’s worth your time isn’t going to
fall for these gimmicks
(re the shoes)
These are hot no doubt But you don’t
need them Youre the real deal

kind of guy who takes two hours to get it just right

TRAVIS
All our rooms are booked solid for
the next eighteen months thanks to
that write-up in Condé Nast

VICKY
It used to be a convent until
Travis got a hold of it

street I don’t know how you sleep
at night man

vow of poverty not me

TRAVIS
(to Claire)
Speaking of vows of poverty I hear
you’re a teacher

CLAIRE
That’s right

TRAVIS
What do you teach

CLAIRE ow
Classical Studies specializing in
Ancient Greek Literature

TRAVIS
Really I didn’t think they still
taught stuff like that in high

school
CLAIRE
What’s that supposed to mean
VICKY
Claire
TRAVIS

Well I mean let’s face it How
many kids are really going to use
what they learn in “Classical
Studies”

As he speaks Travis’s eyes flit to a CURVACEOUS WOMAN in a
SKINTIGHT SKIRT who gets up from a nearby table It’s barely
a glimpse but Claire notices

TRAVIS
Kids nowadays need to be prepared
for the realities of the job
market They need practical
skills

CLAIRE
Skills

TRAVIS
Yeah a trade like plumbing or
machine repair For the brighter
ones technology finance That’s
where the money is

CLAIRE
Ah money That’s the goal then
TRAVIS
Nothing wrong with that

CLAIRE
Except when it’s motivated by
nothing more than greed

TRAVIS
Ooooh we’ve got ourselves a live
one here You’re a little
firecracker when you get riled up
aren’t you

VICKY
You know maybe we should order a
little more —-

CLAIRE
Seriously A “firecracker” Is
that how you regard women who have
an opinion on something

TRAVIS
Only if it disagrees with mine

He laughs trying to lighten the mood Vicky joins in a
little too boisterously Claire gathers her belongings

CLAIRE
It’s getting late and I’ve got an
early morning It was a pleasure

She walks off in a huff

EXT SUSHI RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Light rain falls as Claire hurries to her car
after her

VICKY
Claire wait

Claire stops at her car searching for her keys

VICKY
What the hell was that

Vicky chases

CLAIRE
Come ony vicky You can’t possibly
see me with that guy

WICKY
So you pick a fight with him

CLAIRE
He deserved it

VICKY
What is your problem Can’t you
just lighten up and have some fun

CLAIRE
Maybe I’m not ready for “fun”

VICKY
Then sit at home alone and mope if that’s
what you want But I guarantee you
that’s not what Gary’s up to

CLAIRE
As a matter of fact Gary told me
he hasn’t been with anyone

VICKY
Oh please He screwed around when
you were together You think he’s
suddenly become celibate now that
you’re apart

CLAIRE
Thanks a lot Vicky

Claire opens her car door but Vicky stops her

VICKY
I’m sorry But this limbo thing
you’re wallowing in -- it’s just

not healthy It’s time to move on

Claire gets in slams the door and speeds away

INT CLAIRE’S SUV (MOVING) - NIGHT

Rain pelts the windshield as Claire drives Toto’s “Ill Be
Over You” plays on the radio Claire sings along her voice
cracking with emotion

CLAIRE
Remembering times gone by
Promises we once made
What are the reasons why
Nothing stays the same
As soon as my heart stops breaking
Anticipating
As soon as forever is through
I’1l be over you

INT CLAIRE’S SUV - NIGHT

Claire pulls into her driveway her headlights slicing
through the rain She pushes the garage door remote The
door rises about a foot then stops

CLAIRE
God damn it

EXT PETERSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT
Claire gets out of the car and struggles to lift the door
She raises it several feet when it slips out of her hands and

comes crashing down

She stares at it in disbelief then lets loose on it kicking
it and beating it with her fists until she breaks into sobs

NOAH (0S)
Claire

Claire turns and sees Noah silhouetted by the headlights

CLAIRE
I can’t It’s broken

Noah gently pulls her clear then thrusts the door up with a
spectacular show of force
INT PETERSON HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

Noah leads Claire in Both are drenched their clothes
practically transparent in the headlights

NOAH
You’re soaked

His eyes travel her wet dress clinging to her body She
doesn’t shrink from his gaze

They hover dangerously close to one another But Claire
suddenly pulls back

CLAIRE
I need to pull the car in

NOAH
I’ll take care of it Go inside

INT PETERSON HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Claire enters She wipes her hair with a towel then buries
her face in it

She hears the car pull into the garage and the engine go
quiet She tenses waiting for Noah’s knock

Instead she hears the garage door closing

She peeks out and sees Noah’s legs outside as he Lowers the
garage door Her keys sit on the step at her feet

INT PETERSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire enters in her wet clothes switches on the lights

She starts to draw the curtains but stops and looks out

NOAH’S WINDOW

Dark lifeless No way to tell if he’s there She contemplates it

Then with the curtains still open she UNZIPS HER DRESS and lets it
drop to the floor

She stands there unflinching in nothing but LACY BLACK UNDERWEAR

Slowly her hands travel to the front of her bra They tremble as
they unhook the clasp She hesitates then pulls it open

Her BARE BREASTS
spring forth

She breathes heavily electrified Then gathering all her
courage she slips off her panties

HER NAKED BODY
stands erect but quivers with fear and arousal

For what seems like an eternity she stares out at Noah’s
window completely vulnerable baring her body and soul

Finally unable to endure it any longer she raises both arms
and pulls the curtains shut

Alone now her body shakes uncontrollably She sinks to her
knees clutches her discarded clothes to her body and lets out
an anguished moan

EXT PETERSON HOUSE - DAY

BRIGHT SUNSHINE beats down on Claire who is on her knees
planting flowers in the garden

Noah pulls into his driveway in an OLD VOLVO He gets out with
bags of CHINESE TAKEOUT

NOAH
Wow those look great

CLAIRE
Last chance for a little color
before winter sets in

NOAH
That was some storm last night
wasn’t it

CLAIRE
Yeah Thanks for your help

NOAH
No problem

She studies his face for a hint that he saw her at the
window Nothing

NOAH
Hey you’ve been out here all day
Have you eaten

CLAIRE
No I --

NOAH
I’ve got plenty Why don’t you
join me

CLAIRE

Thanks but I should --

NOAH
Come on You must be starving

With a smile he turns and goes inside leaving the door
open She hesitates for a long moment then follows him in
INT SANDBORN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Claire enters as Noah gathers plates and glasses She looks
around and sees there’s no table or chairs in the dining area

NOAH
We’re still waiting for some of the
furniture Hope you don’t mind
sitting on the floor

He pours wine into two glasses and offers her one

CLAIRE
Oh no I shouldnt And neither
should you

NOAH

I’ve been drinking wine since I was
a kid My mother grew up in
France so she was pretty liberal
about things like that

He takes a sip and holds her glass out to her She
reluctantly takes it but doesn’t drink

NOAH
She always said it’s nobody’s business
what people do in the privacy of their
own homes

He clinks his glass against hers and takes another sip

INT NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

The light outside has faded Claire and Noah eat on the
floor laughing comfortable with each other Noah pours the
last of the wine into Claire’s empty glass

CLAIRE
I’ve been meaning to thank you
NOAH
For what

CLAIRE
For watching out for Kevin Jason
Zimmer has had it in for him since
grade school

NOAH
Zimmer’s a punk
CLAIRE
Gary keeps telling him to ignore
him “Be the bigger man” he says

But honestly There’s a part of me
that wishes Kev would just haul off
and belt the kid

NOAH
Being the “bigger man” is a nice
concept But sometimes it’s more
important just to be a man

Noah gazes at Claire really taking her in

NOAH
I’ve never seen you with your hair
up like that looks nice

CLAIRE
Oh it’s a mess

NOAH
You have a little stork bite on the
back of your neck

CLAIRE
What

NOAH
You know that little red mark some
babies are born with It usually
goes away but you still have yours

He lifts her pony tail and speaks softly near her ear

NOAH
Right there

He rubs his finger along the back of her neck

She shivers

He puts his Lips to the spot She closes her eyes for an

instant

clear

CLAIRE
Noah I can’t

NOAH
Do you want to

CLAIRE
I need to go

She gets to her feet He follows

y aroused Then she pulls away

NOAH
Last night In the window

CLAIRE
You were there

NOAH
Claire You’re magnificent

With that Claire’s defenses crumble

Noah takes her face in his hands and kisses her tenderly
She responds reluctant at first then hungrily

He pushes her against the wall pressing his body against
hers They grope each other tear at each other’s Clothes

Noah pulls off Claire’s shorts her panties He finds her
Bores into her Pounds her rhythmically

Claire moans and writhes Poised between pleasure and guilt
Until finally abandoning all thoughts of anything but now

Her hands clutch his waist his buttocks She pulls him into
her and climaxes wedged between his body and the wall
nowhere else to go

For a long moment Noah remains pressed against her his eyes
fixed on hers He kisses her so tly intertwines his fingers
with hers and pulls her toward the stairs

She resists but with one more tug she follows

INT NOAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - EVENING

The door flings open Claire and Noah stumble in ripping
off what’s left of their clothing their hands lips and
tongues all over each other

Noah throws Claire onto the bed kissing her neck her
breasts touching her in ways she hasnt been touched in
years

suddenly Claire pushes him off Confusion flashes across
Noah’s fac But in the next instant Claire thrusts him
down on his back and crawls on top straddling him

She makes love to him with urgency Noah groans with pleasure

INT NOAH’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
LEBRON JAMES comes in and out of focus

Gradually we realize we’re looking at a life-size poster
through Claire’s blurry eyes

Claire looks to the other side of the bed Empty

She gets to her feet and pulls on some clothes while scanning the
room trophies team pennants sports memorabilia

She stares at a collection of BOBBLE-HEADED CARTOON CHARACTERS
She touches one and watches its head bob her face grim

Then she sees

A PHOTO OF NOAH AND HIS MOTHER

They’ re hugging and smiling Noah looks about twelve His
mother is not a day older than Claire Claire gapes at it the
horror of what she has done crashing in on her

Noah enters shirt off toweling his wet hair

NOAH
Morning

He sees her wan face

NOAH
What’s wrong

CLAIRE
I have to go

NOAH
I thought we could spend the day --

CLAIRE
This was a mistake

NOAH
You’re having second thoughts
It’s normal

CLAIRE
This isn’t normal Nothing about
this is normal

She searches for her shorts her shoes

CLAIRE
Damn it Where are the rest of my
clothes
NOAH

Downstairs Remember

INT NOAH’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Claire races down the stairs Noah at her heels

NOAH
Would you stop for one minute

She finds her shorts puts them on

CLAIRE
I am old enough to be your mother

NOAH
We have a bond Claire Age
doesn’t matter

CLAIRE
It most certainly does

NOAH
Did it last night

CLAIRE
I wasn’t thinking clearly last
night I got swept up in the
moment In you You’re very
sweet And I’ve been so it was
flattering

NOAH
It was more than that

CLAIRE
I know this is hard for you to
understand right now But someday
when you meet the girl of your dreams

NOAH
Oh my God

CLAIRE
--a girl your own age you ‘ll
realize this wasn’t meant’ to be And
I don’t want you to think any of this
is your fault I’m the adult I’m
the one who should have --

NOAH
Stop it Just stop acting like we
did something wrong No matter
what you say it wasn’t wrong

They stand silent for a long moment
CLAIRE
I hope we both can move past this
I mean we’re neighbors and
I would like us to stay friends
He looks away struggling with his emotion
CLAIRE
Are yougoing to be okay Noah
Please look at me

He slowly turns to her mustering a pathetic smile

NOAH
Don’t worry about me I’1l1 be
fine

CLAIRE

Okay well

She gives him an awkward one-armed hug which he halfheartedly
returns She picks up her shoes and slips out the door

EXT NOAH’S HOUSE - MORNING

Claire sprints barefooted across Noah’s lawn

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Claire bursts in and slams the door shut She leans against it
breathless and shaking

INT PETERSON HOUSE - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY

Claire enters ripping off her clothes She turns on the
shower and catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror

She stares at her image -- her hair a tangled mess brush
burns on her face a faint hickey on her neck A total
stranger to her own eyes

She stumbles into the shower and stands under the water
Suddentys she lets out peals of hysterical laughter that just
as quickly turn into tears

We watch her until steam crawls across the shower door
obscuring her from view

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

In a frenzy of guilt-abating activity Claire tends to
bubbling pots on the stove and puts the finishing touches on

a homemade cake

A CAR HORN BEEPS in the driveway She looks up with dread

EXT PETERSON HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EVENING

Gary and Kevin get out of the car Claire steps out a big
smile plastered on her face

CLAIRE

INT PETERSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING

Kevin and Gary regale Claire with stories of their weekend
She seems more relaxed now

KEVIN
So Dad forgot all the cooking gear

GARY

KEVIN

YouTube This mountain dude who lives
in a shack in Montana cooks all his
food on a shovel wrapped in tin foil

CLAIRE

GARY

meal I ever had No offense
They chuckle together like a family Claire’s eyes twinkle
CLAIRE

Kevin and Gary trade a look of surprise as Claire gathers
some plates and heads through the swinging door
INT KITCHEN - EVENING

Claire places the cake on a tray with silverware and plates
She smiles at the laughter of father and son coming from the
other room

She fills a coffee pot with water when

Claire tenses Turns off the tap She can hear Garys voice
but not his words She picks up the tray with the cake and
pushes through the door

INT DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sitting at the table with Gary and Kevin is Noah They laugh
together like old friends They look up at Claire standing
frozen in the doorway

NOAH
Wow Doesn’t that look tasty
Claire crosses the threshold with a wavering smile

CLAIRE
Noah How are you Gary this is

GARY

part for the bathroom sink

GARY

NOAH
They don’t make them like they used
to That’s what my dad always says

KEVIN
(re Gary)
That’s what he says too Every
chance he gets

GARY
Because it’s true

Claire hands out plates of cake then sits next to Gary
rather than in her original seat which is now next to Noah

Gary helps Claire with her chair then casually drapes his arm
across its back giving Claire’s shoulder a squeeze

Noah’s jaw clenches ever so slightly

KEVIN
(to Noah)
So what I miss while I was gone
Anything big

Claire speaks to Gary but looks at Noah her words meant as a
warning to him

CLAIRE
I wouldn’t recommend it

NOAH
Really I heard it’s pretty good

CLAIRE
Trust me you don’t want to go
there

Claire takes a drink of water glowering at Noah over her the
top of her glass He returns her gaze A standoff

Finally Noah gets to his feet

NOAH

Well it’s getting late

KEVIN
It’s only nine

CLAIRE
Don’t you have homework Kevin

of compassion in her eyes

CLAIRE

NOAH
Okay maybe sending flowers was a
bad idea But give me a break I

INT PETERSON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Claire reads in bed when she hears the sound of pebbles
hitting the window She gets up and sees Gary down in the
yard She opens the window

CLAIRE
Gary What in the world

GARY
I didn’t want to wake Kev

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
At the door Gary presents Claire with a BOUQUET OF GARDENIAS

CLAIRE
Oh Gary they’re gorgeous

GARY
And it’s not just because some
other guy beat me to it

CLAIRE
There is no other guy Another
teacher’s flowers were delivered to
me by mistake that’s all

GARY
Guess I should take it as a good
sign you thought they were from me

She fills a vase with water He hovers gazing at her
nightgown her freshly scrubbed face

GARY
Were you asleep
CLAIRE
Just reading a little
He moves close runs his hand along her arm

GARY
I miss seeing you like this

They hold a long look then fall into a passionate kiss
Gary’ s hands travel down Claire’s back to her buttocks He
pulls her against him Their breathing becomes heavy
Claire opens her eyes for just a second and sees

NOAH

watching them through the window of the back door His face
is tight his eyes menacing Claire pushes Gary away

Gary turns and spots Noah And in that instant Noahs
sullen expression changes to a sheepish grin

Gary swings the door open

GARY
Hey Noah

NOAH
Hi Mr Peterson So sorry to
interrupt but I think I left my
cell phone here

CLAIRE
It’s a little late

NOAH
I know but I saw the light and my
dad’s supposed to call from Qatar

Before Claire can protest Noah heads into the adjoining family
room

GARY
Qatar What’s he doing there

NOAH
Some big hotel development he’s
working on

Noah bends down in front of the couch blocking Claire’s and
Gary’s view of him and searches the cushions He slips the
phone out of his pocket and drops it underneath the couch

NOAH
Here it is

Noah holds up the phone triumphantly and returns to the
kitchen where he spots Gary’s flowers

NOAH
Nice flowers

GARY
Gardenias Claire’s favorite

Gary wraps his arm around Claire’s waist and kisses her She
smiles uncomfortable and pulls away

NOAH
Even nicer than the ones you got at
school today

CLAIRE

I was past telling Mr Peterson
that those were delivered to me by
mistake

NOAH
Oh right

GARY
You got a girlfriend Noah

NOAH
Not really

GARY

A good-looking guy like you You
probably have your pick of them

NOAH
I’ve got my eye on someone at
school But she doesn’t seem
interested

GARY

Don’t let that stop you She’s
probably just playing hard to get
Women love to make us guys suffer

CLAIRE
Gary It’s late I’m sure Noah
needs to get to sleep

Gary glances at his watch

GARY
Oh right Me too Big meeting in
the morning

He gives Claire a peck

GARY

See you later
(to Noah)
Come on kiddo

He puts his arm around Noah’s shoulder and escorts him out
Noah glances back at Claire his eyes dark Claire shuts the
door behind them

INT WILKERSON PREP - CLAIRE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

Claire sits on her desk in front of her students holding a copy
of “OEDIPUS THE KING” She avoids eye contact with Noah

CLAIRE
So what do you think Sophocles was
trying to teach the Greeks through
this play

Noah raises his hand but Claire searches for someone else
She sees Allie whispering to the girl next to her

CLAIRE
Allie
ALLIE
Ummm I don’t know
CLAIRE

Give it a shot

ALLIE
Maybe that you can’t change
your fate

CLAIRE
Yes Allie excellent Throughout
the story we see Oedipus trying to
avoid his fate Yet it continually
catches up with him doesn’t it

Noah raises his hand again but Claire ignores it

CLAIRE
So perhaps the story is meant to
show how powerless man is against
the gods

NOAH
Yeah well I had a different take
on the whole thing

Claire visibly stiffens at the interruption

OAH
I think oedi pus’ s downfall was
caused by Yoctes turning a blind
eye to the fac I mean we all
know you can’t ignore the truth for
long before it comes back and bites
you in the ass

His tone is confrontational his smile taunting

As Claire struggles to maintain her composure the bell rings
and students jump to their feet

CLAIRE
We’1l continue this tomorrow

The class files out while Claire erases the board But Noah
lingers When the last student is gone he approaches
NOAH
What the hell was that

CLAIRE
What are you talking about

NOAH
You kept blowing me off

He whips out a paper from his binder

NOAH
And a “D” on the essay

CLAIRE
You didn’t write about the topic I
assigned Youre lucky I didn’t
give you an “F”

She gathers up her things and goes for the door He follows
NOAH
Did you even read it My topic was
way better than the one you gave
CLAIRE
That’s beside the point You need
to learn to follow the rules Noah
He grabs her arm before she makes it out the door

NOAH
Oh like you do

CLAIRE
Let go of me

He does reluctantly She hurries out

INT WILKERSON PREP - HALLWAY - DAY

Noah storms out of Claire’s classroom balling up the essay
in his fist A STUDENT calls out his name but he ignores
him and keeps going his face enraged

He turns the corner and spots Kevin his back pressed up
against the lockers by Jason Zimmer who swats him upside the
head every time he opens his mouth to speak

Noahs look turns rabid He charges at Jason grabs him by
the collar and slams him face first into the lockers

KEVIN
Hey it’s okay He was just --

But Noah bashes Jason’s face with his fist an absolute look
of madness in his eyes Kevin watches with a combination of
horror and awe Other students gather at a distance

Jason lands a punch or two but he’s no match for Noahs
torrent of fury Soon enough Jason falls to the floor face
down barely moving

Noah pulls Jasons head up by the hair and hisses into his ear

NOAH
He’s mine Understand

Jason blinks utterly confused

Noah lets Jason’s head drop to the floor then gives him a
kick in the gut for good measure He turns to Kevin

NOAH
Go ahead Give it all you got

KEVIN
No It’s enough

NOAH
Pussy Just like your old man

He turns and stalks off Kevin stares after him

What’s going on

HEADMASTER WARREN
Noah Sandborn and Jason Zimmer
exchanged blows earlier this morning
Noah is in the nurse’s office and Jason
is on his way to the hospital

CLAIRE
Kevin Were you involved in this

HEADMASTER WARREN
It appears he’s the only bystander
who saw how the fight started So
I’m counting on him to enlighten me

Kevin sits mute wanting no part of this

CLAIRE
Kevin

Kevin looks to the floor silent

HEADMASTER WARREN
Then I have no choice but to
suspend both of them

KEVIN
Jason was being a jerk to me again
Noah tried to stop him

HEADMASTER WARREN
How

KEVIN
He told Zimmer to knock it off
That’s when Zimmer popped him

HEADMASTER WARREN
So Jason threw the first punch
You’re absolutely certain

KEVIN
Noah was only defending himself

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT
Kevin brushes his teeth Claire knocks then enters

CLAIRE
I think we should talk

KEVIN
About what

CLAIRE
Jason has been suspended for a
week

Kevin shrugs spits

CLAIRE
I realize what a tough spot Mr
Warren and I put you in It would
have been hard to rat on Noah if he’d
been the one who started that fight

KEVIN
What’s gonna happen to Noah

CLAIRE
A weeks detention And he’s not
allowed to go to Homecoming

KEVIN
He wasn’t going anyway

He gets into bed

CLAIRE
This suspension will go on Jason’s
permanent record Justas he’s
apprying to colleges It could
really hurt his future

EVIN
Yeah well sometimes you get what
you deserve

He rolls away from her She lingers wanting to say more
But she turns out the light and leaves

EXT WOODS - TRAILCLEARING - DAY

Claire runs along the ravine pushing herself working off
steam As usual she leaps over the fallen sycamore in the
clearing completing her run

Breathing deeply she stretches against the fallen sycamore
when she spots

THE CARVING OF HER AND GARY’S INITIALS

It’s been gouged out with a knife Completely obliterated
Claire stares at it agitated her mind racing

Suddenly a BRANCH CRACKS somewhere behind her the sound
echoing through the trees

She whirls around and scans the woods Nothing -- not even a
squirrel

Thoroughly spooked she turns and runs toward the house

EXT PETERSON HOUSE - DAY

Claire emerges from the woods into her backyard when she sees
Noah’s father in his driveway getting into his Audi

Claire runs inside and returns with her keys She hops into
her car and heads in the same direction

INT CLAIRE’S SUV (MOVING) - DAY

Claire drives searching for the Audi She comes to a bus
intersection and spots it sitting at a light a couple of blocks
to her left She changes lanes to make the turn when her light
changes red She slams on the brakes

CLAIRE
Damn it

After a moment the Audi gets a green light and continues on
Claire waits impatiently for hers to turn

CLAIRE
Come on

When her light turns green she guns it cutting in front of
oncoming traffic to make the left-hand turn

Now she has some serious catching up to do She weaves in
and out but heavy traffic keeps her at a distance

Without warning the Audi turns and pulls into a parking
garage underneath a fifteen-story OFFICE BUILDING

Claire immediately changes lanes Horns honk tires squeal
She’s forced to drive past the building

She parks illegally and rushes toward the building

INT OFFICE BUILDING ATRIUM - DAY

father heading to an elevator his back to her

CLAIRE
(calling)

Claire puts her hand to his shoulder and he turns to face
her To her astonishment it’s a complete STRANGER

CLAIRE
I’m sorry I thought you were

He gets on the elevator and the doors close between them
Claire turns back to the vast atrium teaming with people
But Mr Sandborn is nowhere to be seen

shell
CLAIRE

light “Her breath forms a cloud in the cold air She spots
a jug of punch on a shelf and goes for it

Suddenly the door SLAMS SHUT

She jumps startled She looks around She’s all alone but
somehow it doesn’t feel like it

She grabs the punch and rushes to the door But the handle
doesn’t budge With rising panic she jiggles the handle and
bangs on the door

Finally the handle clicks and turns She flings the door
open and runs out letting it slam shut behind her

INT WILKERSON PREP - HALLWAY - NIGHT

but he shoves her up against the wall

NOAH
Your behavior has been completely
unacceptable

CLAIRE
My behavior --

NOAH

suddenly wants to come crawling back
and you decide you don’t need me
anymore You’re just done with me

CLAIRE
I thought we agreed --

NOAH

even fix the fucking garage door

He pounds his fist into the wall next to her head She
winces with fear

NOAH
I’m sorry but I love you And
I know you love me You’re just

scared

He presses up against her and tries kissing her She pushes
him away Undeterred he goes for her again This time she
SLAPS HIM hard across the face He stares at her stunned

CLAIRE
It was one night It’s not love

her back and grabs onto the headboard white-knuckled
gasping for air as items -- alarm clock photos books —-

kill his father and sleep with his mother -- was wrong

JOCASTA
As for marrying your mother you

dreamed that dream Every man is
his mother’s lover in imagination
or in --

Just then Jocasta’s words are replaced by the LUSTY MOANS OF
A WOMAN

Claires students stir with confusion then erupt in giggles
as it becomes clear that the dialogue has been dubbed over
with the FRENETIC SOUNDS OF TWO PEOPLE HAVING SEX

These kids can’t possibl recognize the lovers’ groans as
Claire’s and Noah But Claire does

She rushes to the DVD player pounding on the remote But
the scene continues the sex noises growing more feverish by
the second

The students hoot and holler as Claire frantically pushes
buttons on the DVD player Finally the TV screen goes blank
and the DVD pops out But it’s total bedlam now

between you and Noah Sandborn

CLAIRE
What do you mean

HEADMASTER WARREN
Mike Schmidt reported an incident
yesterday on the field

CLAIRE
Oh that It was nothing I was
reprimanding him For skipping
class

HEADMASTER WARREN
Mike said you got physical with
him You grabbed him

CLAIRE
I may have pulled his arm a little
just to get his attention

HEADMASTER WARREN
You know what our policy is
regarding physical contact with
students --

CLAIRE
Yes of course but --

HEADMASTER WARREN
Frankly I’m more than a little
concerned what with the interest
you took in him early on --

CLAIRE
Interest I did nothing more than
I would for any student who wanted
to be in my class

HEADMASTER WARREN
And then there’s this

He slides her a photo of a wall covered in graffiti Phrases
such as “I fucked Mrs Peterson” and “Claire Peterson is
one great lay” She stares in disbelief

HEADMASTER WARREN
It was on the wall of the boys’
lavatory across from your room
I’ve had it painted over but I
intend to speak to the boys in your
class about it Including Noah

CLAIRE
Come on Ed You start questioning
the boys and you’re just going to
fuel the flames of a ridiculous
rumor

HEADMASTER WARREN
This is a serious matter

CLAIRE
I’m sure I’m not the first teacher
whose name has appeared on the bathroom
wall That’s what boys do

HEADMASTER WARREN
I’m not questioning your integrity
Claire But we can’t tolerate even
an appearance of impropriety
without a thorough investigation
It’s for your own protection

calibrating itself Claire stops it

Claire moves the computer mouse and Noah’s desktop appears She
clicks on the HARD DRIVE and scans its contents

She sees it almost immediately A FOLDER LABELED “CLAIRE”
She opens it and finds hundreds of candid photos of herself

The early photos capture Claire performing mundane tasks
gardening unloading groceries taking out the trash

But gradually they become more intimate There’s Claire reading
in bed eating dinner with Kevin kissing Gary and then
UNDRESSING FOR NOAH AT HER BEDROOM WINDOW

CLAIRE

She scrolls down and lets out a tiny gasp when she sees a MOVIE
FILE And from its thumbnail it’s clear that this is what she’s
been looking for

Claire drags the movie file and the photos to the trash and
hits the “SECURE EMPTY TRASH” button

A message warns that the files will be permanently deleted
Without hesitation she hits the delete button

Claire closes the empty folder and is about to put the computer
back to sleep when she spots a FOLDER LABELED “MARISSA”

Claire opens it and sees scores of candid photos of a PRETTY
FAIR-HAIRED WOMAN in her early thirties

Claire zeros in on a series of photos taken in rapid succession
- Marissa exits a red brick building teenagers all about

- She walks to a waiting car

- She gets in on the passenger side

- She kisses the man who is driving

Claire enlarges a photo that includes the building The words
“BAY VIEW HIGH SCHOOL” are carved in the stone pediment

Claire hits the print button and the printer comes to life
But just as suddenly it stops The display “Add Paper”

CLAIRE
Damn it

She rummages finds a few stray sheets and shoves them in
The printer churns out part of the photo then grinds to a
halt “Paper Jam”

With growing panic Claire slams various compartments and
trays until the printer resumes and spits the photo out

Claire grabs it and runs from the room

She has no choice but to answer it

He looks her over head tiltéd with curiosity

JIM ROBIE

to you off the record

aggressive Sexually Toward
certain female faculty members

something going on between them

PRINCIPAL BRODIE
Let me be absolutely clear While
it’s possible that this young man
harbored some kind of schoolboy
crush on Marissa I can assure you
nothing ever came of it And I
will not allow you to disparage the
memory of one of Bay View’s finest
teachers not to mention the
reputation of this school

threatened all kinds of things

CLAIRE
Oh my God

RHONDA
You have to understand Mrs
Peterson Marissa was a good
person She was just naive And
very lonely

CLAIRE
What about her boyfriend

RHONDA
Alex treated her like shit -- made
her feel completely worthless
Noah saw how vulnerable she was
how much she needed to be loved

CLAIRE
And he took advantage

RHONDA
He knew every button to push And
he could be quite the charmer But
something tells me you already know
that

Claire lowers her eyes ashamed

RHONDA
As big a creep as Alex was I never
believed he killed her He wasn’t
the kind to do something like that

CLAIRE
What are you saying He was set
up

RHONDA
Marissa would tell me things about
Noah How jealous he was of Alex
How desperate he became when she
tried to end it I didn’t think
much about it But then after
Marissa’s murder I happened see to
something in Noah’s fi Something
I wasn’t supposed to see

CLAIRE
Tell me

RHONDA
Noah’s mother hanged herself when
he was eleven

CLAIRE
No

RHONDA
And that’s not the worst of it
She had been molesting him since he
wasa little boy Apparently she
couldn’t live with herself anymore

like that makes for one pretty

Kevin Come on Come on That’s
no way to handle this

Kevin fights Gary but emotion soon overwhelms him and he
collapses against Gary with a sob

GARY
It’s going to be okay We’re going
to work this out As a family

Noah staggers to his feet

NOAH

You think she wants any part of
your pathetic little “family”
All your “be a bigger man”
bullshit From the guy who fucks
around Some big man Gary

(to Kevin)
And you ou self-centered little
pric en was the last time you
even told her you loved her
You both had your chance I’m the
one she turned to when she needed
someone I am her family

Gary stares at Noah the kid’s madness fully dawning on him

GARY
She was right You are one twisted
little bastard

With that Noah charges at Gary but Gary grabs him by the
collar and slams him against the wall

GARY
Let me tell you something you piece
of shit It’s going to take a hell
of a lot more than some little boy to
tear this family apart

Gary lets go of him and puts his arm around Kevin

GARY
Come on Kev lLet’s go home

They leave together Noah remains pressed against the wall
shake

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Gary and Kevin enter Kevin rushes up the stairs

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KEVINS ROOM - NIGHT

Kevin enters throws himself onto the bed and flips on the
stereo Cello music pours out Defiantly he cranks it up
INT PETERSON HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

As the cello music plays upstairs Gary picks up Kevins
laptop from the floor He sees Noah and Claire frozen on the

screen He closes the video window and deletes the video

With shaky hands he pours himself a drink Swallows it in
one gulp Pours another

He spots his Blackberry sitting on the desk where he left it
and sees a voicemail message from Claire

Suddenly there’s a LOUD CLATTER from another room

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Gary enters sniffing the air

GARY
What the hell

He follows the smell to the basement door and opens it Thin
WISPS OF SMOKE greet him

He rushes to the cupboard under the sink and roots around

NOAH (0OS)
Looking for this

Gary turns as a FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes at his face sending
him to the floor He’s stunned but fully conscious

Noah watches him struggle to get up Then he raises the
extinguisher and brings it crashing down on Gary’s skull

Gary stares at Noah with blank eyes then falls back with a
thud Out cold

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

The cello music blares as Kevin washes his face When he
comes up from the sink and opens his eyes he sees a flash of
something behind him in the mirror

He whirls around and looks into his room Nothing He goes
back to rinsing his face

The music abruptly stops Kevin looks up puzzled trying
his face he goes to the stereo and sees that the Swite has
been flipped off
He notices the eerie quiet of his surroundings
KEVIN
(calling)

Dad
Kevin swings open his door and is met with a PUNCH IN THE
FACE from Noah Kevin drops to the floor

OAH
What I tell you The face man
Works every time

Kevin struggles to get up but Noah slugs him over and over
again Blood spurts from Kevin’s nose and lips

Through blurred vision Kevin sees Noah above him raising
KEVIN’S CELLO up into the air
THE STEEL TAIL-SPIKE OF THE CELLO

hovers over Kevin then plunges down headed straight for
Kevin’s groin

Kevin rolls away just before the tail-spike pierces the
carpet and the floor below it While Noah struggles to yank
the cello free Kevin scrambles to his feet and runs out

INT PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Smoke fills the room An alarm shrieks Kevin bounds down
the stairs

KEVIN
Dad

Kevin doesn’t see Gary’s body lying behind the kitchen
island But he hears Noah coming right behind

Kevin flings open the back door and runs out into the night

Noah barrels down the stairs in hot pursuit Before
following Kevin out Noah stops to grab a BUTCHER KNIFE from
the knife block on the island

He starts for the door when Gary reaches out and grabs Noahs
ankle tripping him

Noah sees Gary’s eyes cracked open behind a veil of blood

NOAH
A little late in the game for
heroics Gary
Noah plunges the knife into Gary’s gut Gary HOWLS with pain
Noah pulls the knife out and wipes it clean on Gary’s pants
He heads out the door
EXT PETERSON HOUSE - NIGHT
Claire skids into the driveway nearly ramming Gary’s car
She jumps out and races to the house
INT PETERSON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Claire rushes in crazy with panic choking on the smoke

CLAIRE
Gary Kevin

A MOAN comes from behind the island Claire finds Gary
clinging to life

CLAIRE
Gary Oh my God
GARY
Kevin
CLAIRE

Where is he

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Kevin runs through dense trees He looks back for Noah and
his foot catches a tree root He tumbles to the ground

He lies there for a moment listening Silence Then the
CRUNCH OF FOOTSTEPS and an eerily calm voice

NOAH (0OS)
I know you’re here bro I can
smell you

Kevin sees Noah walk by less than thirty feet away The
KNIFE IN HIS HAND glints in the moonlight

NOAH
Come out and fight like a man
Even your chickenshit father did in
the end

Noah disappears behind some trees Kevin takes off in the
opposite direction

Noah hears him and turns to see his shadowy figure heading
deeper into the woods He follows the gleam of the hunter
in his eyes

EXT PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - NIGHT
A faraway SIREN WAILS as Claire pulls Gary to safety
CLAIRE
I’ve got to find them
GARY
No He’ll kill you

CLAIRE
I love you Gary

Claire runs off toward the woods stopping only to grab a
SHOVEL leaning against the garage
EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Kevin stops in the clearing With the RAVINE up ahead and
Noah right behind he’s got nowhere to run

He spies the FALLEN SYCAMORE and tucks himself under its
massive trunk accidentally brushing against the TIRE SWING
and setting it in motion

Noah enters the clearing
NOAH
Come on Kev I’m not going to
hurt you I just want to talk

Noah notices the tire swing moving He goes to it and stops
it His eyes scan the area

KEVIN

sees Noah’s legs so close he could reach out and touch them
He barely breathes

NOAH

circles the clearing searching as DISTANT SIRENS grow
louder His impatience builds

NOAH
So you’re just going to let me get
away with it I fucked your mother
man You should have seen her
Begging me for it

KEVIN
shakes with rage but remains silent
NOAH (0S)
« like a dog So I gave it to
her Just like she wanted it
NOAH

stomps around with growing frustration slashing the brush
with his knife

NOAH
I fucked d your girlfriend little
whore ucking butchered your old
man right there on your kitchen
linoleum And you’re just gonna
run away and hide you candy-ass
son-of-a-bitch

Suddenly Claire’s voice echoes through the trees

CLAIRE (0S)
Kevin

NOAH
Here comes mommy Kevin You going
to wait for her to rescue you
Noah calls out mimicking Kevin’s voice

NOAH
Mom

CLAIRE
hears Noahs call as she runs through the woods

CLAIRE
I’m coming

KEVIN
scrambles out from his hiding place
KEVIN
(calling to Claire)
He’s got a knife
NOAH
Finally A set of balls

Noah lunges for Kevin with his knife Kevin dodges him
Noah comes at him again but this time Kevin grabs his wrist

They lock ina struggle over the knife The blade inches
ever closer to Kevin’s throat

Finally in an act of utter desperation Kevin knees Noah in
the groin While Noah is doubled over in pain Kevin tackles
him The knife goes flying

The two boys wrestle Kevin lands a couple of lucky punches
but Noah quickly gains the upper hand and pummels Kevin until
he PASSES OUT

Straddling Kevin Noah raises a large rock overhead and is
about to crush Kevin’s skull with it when

WHACK

Claires shovel bashes Noah upside the head He keels over
and lies motionless in the dirt

Claire rushes to Kevin She listens for breathing wipes the
blood from his face

CLAIRE
Kevin Can you hear me Come on
honey Wake up

Noah starts to come to Claire shakes Kevin

CLAIRE
Kevin

Noah groans and sits up Claire scrambles to her feet wielding
the shovel like a batter anticipating a four-steam fastball

CLAIRE
Stay away Noah I’m warning you

Noah gets to his feet but keeps his distance

NOAH
He doesn’t appreciate you Claire
Not like I do

CLAIRE
Like the way you appreciated your
mother

NOAH
You know nothing about my mother or
how it was between us he loved me
The way you love me

CLAIRE
No

NOAH
You do I know you do I saw it
in your eyes that night It
doesn’t just go away

CLAIRE
Stay where you are

NOAH
I saw it

Suddenly Noah charges her Claire swipes at him but he’s
too quick He comes in low and tackles her to the ground

Claire thrashes and flails like a wild animal Noah
straddles her writhing body enduring her blows until pinning
her arms above her head

Defeated and exhausted Claire grows still

Noah breaths heavily exhilarated He leans in to kiss her
but she turns her head away And that’s when she sees it

THE KNIFE
in the dirt out of reach but a lifeline just the same

Noah nuzzles Claire’s neck and begins to move on top of her
pressing his pelvis into her humping her

Gradually Claire begins to move with him She moans with
pleasure Purrs into his ear

CLAIRE
How do you do this to me

With growing excitement Noah’s kisses travel up to her face
to her lips She kisses him deeply

NOAH
You see how good we are together
I am all you need Not them

She nods her eyes sincere He smiles and leans in for
another kiss when Claire LUNGES up and BITES HIS NOSE

Noah howls and thrashes wildly his blood spurting But Claire
hangs on like a pit bull

Noah digs his fingers into her eyes and bashes her face with his
fist until finally she releases him He jumps to his feet
blood gushing from his nose

NOAH
You bitch

She dives for the knife but before she can reach it Noah
grabs her hair and yanks her to her feet

He pushes her up against a WEATHERED WOODEN FENCE -- a flimsy
barrier between them and the RAVINE

NOAH
I loved you

Noah clamps his hands around Claire’s throat and slowly
squeezes the life out of her

CLAIRE
Please Noah

Suddenly off screen there’s an almost INHUMAN ROAR
Noah turns to see Kevin charging toward them
KEVIN
Kevin rams Noah against the fence with A CRACK and lands a
few blows to Noah’s already mangled face

Noah rallies grabbing Kevin by the shirt and swinging him
around against the fence with ANOTHER CRACK

Noah pummels him in the gut Kevin stays on his feet but
THE FENCE

splinters with each blow until finally with the last punch it
gives way The boys go tumbling over the side of the cliff

CLAIRE
No

Claire dashes to the cliff’s edge and peers down into the black
abyss She can make out only the vague contours of a NARROW
OUTCROPPING OF ROCK about fifteen feet below

CLAIRE
Kevin

KEVIN (0S)
(barely audible)
Mom

CLAIRE
Hang on

Claire finds Noah’s knife and cuts the rope of the tire swing
with it She ties one end to a tree and sends the other end
over the cliff

CLAIRE
Can you reach the rope

After a moment there’s a tug

CLAIRE
Good Now climb up

She sits on the ground and coils the rope around her hands
Kevin’s weight is almost too much for her but she holds on
fast taking up the slack whenever she can

After a few moments she sees his hand reach up over the
edge Claire grabs his wrist and pulls him up

As the top of his head emerges from the darkness he lets out
a small GRUNT OF EXERTION

Claire stops cold unnerved

CLAIRE
Kevin

He turns his blood-covered face up to her And it’s not
Kevin’s eyes she’s looking into

IT’S NOAH

Claire recoils and releases his wrist

As Noah slides over the edge he grabs Claire’s foot dragging
her with him She snags the rope just before going over

OVER THE SIDE OF THE CLIFF

Claire dangles from the rope with Noah clinging to her She
squirms and kicks but he’s attached to her like a leech

After a moment he begins a slow and steady climb up the
length of Claires body His fingers rip her clothes dig
into her flesh Her grip grows weaker by the second

CLAIRE
I cant hold on

He presses his lips to her ear hissing

NOAH
Go ahead Let go

But she doesn’t And he hoists himself up to solid ground

Noah crouches down and extends his hand to her Claire
stares up at him defiantly

NOAH
I’d never do anything to hurt you
Claire
Claire’s HANDS SLIP

NOAH
You can trust me

His face is as innocent as a choirboy’s

Claire hesitates then reaches out and grasps his hand She
gives a hint of a smile before her grip tightens

CLAIRE
But you can’t trust me

NOAH’S EYES

widen with surprise as Claire yanks him over the cliff

He lets out a BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM as his body bounces off
the outcropping of rocks and plummets to the bottom of the

ravine

Claire hangs there gasping for breath Then she slowl
climbs up Fighting back tears she peers into the ravine

CLAIRE
Kevin

But there’s no response Claire falls to her knees and wails
with despair Then suddenly there’s weak cry

KEVIN (0S)
Mom

Claire sees the rope MOVING She peers into the ravine and
sees Kevin climbing up

When he nears the top Claire reaches out for him

THEIR HANDS clasp together united Claire pulls Kevin to
safety

Now on solid ground Kevin falls into his mother’s arms
They hold each other as SIRENS WAIL in the distance

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT PETERSON HOUSE - DAY

A “SOLD” sign is staked on the snow-covered lawn Claire and
Kevin load boxes into a U-Haul trailer

CLAIRE
You got everything

KEVIN
Except for my laptop

He runs off to the house
A POSTAL TRUCK pulls up and a MAILMAN hops out

MAILMAN
Need a signature

Claire signs for it He hands her an envelope and drives off

Claire stares at the return address ILLINOIS STATE BOARD OF
EDUCATION

She opens it and unfolds an official looking letter She
reads “We hereby inform jyou that your teaching license has
been permanently revoked

Claire smiles sadly and folds up the letter She glances up
at the garage

INT PETERSON GARAGE - DAY

Dark and dusty The automatic garage door opens

Claire enters and looks around for anything she might have
left She spots a small box containing dormant flower bulbs

GARY (0S)
Honey

Claire looks up and sees Gary a jagged scar visible on his shorn
scalp his movements stilted is if still nursing his wounds

GARY
You about ready to go

Claire goes to Gary They wrap their arms around each other
and walk to the car where Kevin waits

We remain in the garage as the automatic door descends
leaving us in total darkness

FADE OUT

THE END
