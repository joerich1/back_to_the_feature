Writers First Draft

May 22 2006
FADE IN
EXT A SMALL TEXAS TOWN - EARLY MORNING

The kind of town where people get by and then die The
morning sun has no choice but to come up over the horizon

A SQUIRREL scurries across a telephone line down a
pole over a DONT MESS WITH TEXASS sticker into an
apartment complex parking lot

EXT SHERWOOD FOREST APARTMENT COMPLEX

--and under a BLACK EXTENDED CAB PICK-UP TRUCK that faces
out of its parking spot Its filthy As evident by the
dirt graffiti Fing Wash Me The drivers side mirror
hangs by a metal thread On the windshield ONE DEAD
GOLDFISH eyes wide open

and in the back window an EMPTY GUN RACK

INT BATHROOM

A box of AMMUNITION

A pair of female hands with a perfect FRENCH MANICURE loads
bullets into a SHOTGUN One by one The only jewelry a
THIN SILVER BAND on the middle finger of her left hand
INT BEDROOM

A clock radio -- the numbers flip from 559 to 600

COUNTRY MUSIC fills the room as a hand reaches over and HITS
the snooze button A millisecond of silence

An OFF-SCREEN SHOTGUN IS COCKED

The mound in the middle of the bed lifts his eye mask This
is WYATT 34 handsome in a ruggedly casual never-washes-his-
jeans way He has a SMALL MOLE on his neck which if you
squint looks like Texas Wyatt’s all about maintaining the
status quo If he used words like status quo Still
doesn’t much care for the

BARREL OF A SHOTGUN in his face

SAM (0S)
Morning baby

SAM 34 12 with gun in hand stands on the bed over Wyatt
She holds her weapon steady and her gaze even steadier It’s
as if she’s been waiting for this one moment in time for
hours If not all her life
WYATT
(half asleep)

Mornin’
SAM

I’m not getting any younger
WYATT

What--
SAM

And I want to have kids before I
die

WYATT

SAM

WYATT

same apartment We share the same
bed We piss in the same goddamn
toilet
SAM
I was referring to the gun--
(re swearing)

WYATT

a-ring box

END FREEZE FRAME

WYATT
Hell we are

INT BATHROOM - A MINUTE LATER

Wyatt stands in his underwear pissed and pissing as Sam
waits in the doorway with her gun aimed at him

SAM (VO)
Which is why Im bearing arms Not
only is it my constitutional right
its my emotional right after
dating Wyatt for ten years and two
days and getting a water accessory
pamphlet as an anniversary gift

WYATT
Jesus Sam my pecker’s out Can’t
you point that thing elsewhere

SAM
Nope

He finishes up flushes and faces Sam

WYATT
Why are you doin’ this

SAM
Because you won’t Hands please

Sam motions with the gun to turn around Wyatt begrudgingly
goes to the sink and passes his hands under the water

SAM
Face it Wyatt I’m onto you And
a little soap wouldn’t kill you
An angry squirt of hand soap

INT BEDROOM - ANOTHER MINUTE LATER

Wyatt puts on a pair of crumpled up jeans off the floor
WYATT
I don’t know what you think you’re
onto me about but I didnt do
nothin’ Not one thing

Sam waits with her gun

SAM
Exactly Its called stalling
Wyatt You were stalling and
everyone knew it Trixie Alex
Lauren Steinberger Everyone but me

INT HALLWAY - ANOTHER MINUTE LATER

Wyatt pulls on a t-shirt as Sam follows him closely with her
weapon A small EMPTY FISH TANK is in the hallway

WYATT
I wasn’t stalling I was just
waiting for the right time-- I
am a lot younger than you are

A DUFFEL BAG is near the front door She bends down picks
it up and shoves it at his torso

SAM
Six months is not younger

WYATT
In man years it is And who the
heck’s Lauren Steinberger

SAM
Doesnt matter What matters is
the promise you made to me five
years ago

Sam holds up her left hand With the thin silver band
SAM
You wanted to spend the rest of
your life with me Well

Sam picks up a LARGE RECTANGULAR BOX off the ground

SAM
We’1ll need this for it

EXT SHERWOOD FOREST APARTMENT COMPLEX - MORNING

Sam escorts her hostage down the steps to the parking lot
They approach Wyatt’s truck She gestures for him to drive
SAM
Get in

Wyatt cant help but notice a DEAD FISH on his windshield

WYATT
Is that Lucy--

SAM
There was an accident

Sam kisses her fingertips touches the dead fish

SAM
Sorry baby

and FLICKS it off the truck into the parking lot Wyatt
looks at Sam in shock

WYATT
It’s like I don’t even know you

SAM
Get in

INT TRUCK

Wyatt is driving Sam and her gun are next to him She leans
into Wyatt to document the moment with her digital camera

SAM
Okay now smile This ones for

SAM
Wyatt I said smile

WYATT

WYATT
It was a given

SAM
(posing smiling)
Smile--

FLASH
MAIN TITLE Shotgun Wedding

FREEZE FRAME On the picture of Wyatt and Sam A pissed-off
hostage and half of the face of a beaming bride-to-be The
tip of the shotgun peeks in at the bottom

SAM (VO)
Obviously this isnt exactly how I
imagined our engagement would go But
from what Ive heard on Oprah youve
got to let go of your childhood
fantasies and embrace your reality
This is my reality This man That
shotgun there in the corner

CUT BACK TO
EXT STEPHEN F AUSTIN HIGH SCHOOL - FLASHBACK
Students socialize on the front lawn
SAM (VO)
And a thirteen-year-old
troublemaker who goes by the name
Lauren Steinberger

The BELL RINGS

Everyone pauses to ponder the bell and then as if on cue
returns to their yammering

SAM (VO)
It all started two days ago On
the tenth anniversary of my first
date with Wyatt

INT SAMS OFFICE
A small sad desk plaque SAMANTHA JUDD GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

Sam sits in a small sad office behind a small sad but
orderly metal desk She looks at a report card

SAM (VO)
I wasnt the only one who was
starting to have concerns about this
thing I called my ‘relationship’
A bespectacled student dripping in pink sits in front of her
Shes much wiser

This is the infamous LAUREN STEINBERGER
than her years and her outfit

SAM
So Lauren you want to tell me

what happened in Geometry

LAUREN
The Pythagorean Theorem Are you
married

SAM
(caught off guard)
Am I married Well no--

LAUREN
Don’t you have a boyfriend

SAM
Yes I have a boyfriend -- but we
really should be talking tutors here

LAUREN
Tutors are for dorks Why arent
you married yet

Lauren spots a framed photo of Wyatt and picks it up

SAM
Tutors are not for dorks I hada

tutor-—
Feeling like a dork Sam takes the photo away from Lauren

SAM (CONTD)
And Wyatt and I are just waiting
for the right time that’s all

LAUREN
Hes stalling

SAM
No he’s not Being an adult is just
much more complicated than it looks
And I am much older than he is

LAUREN
Now you’re just making excuses for

him

SAM
(nervous laughter)
Why would I make excuses for him
LAUREN
My guess Low self-esteem sucky
eggs and overwhelming middle-aged
peer pressure My boyfriend says
hes going to marry me as soon as
we graduate

Unbeknownst to Lauren she has just poked the bear

SAM

Uh-huh and have you ever thought
that maybe your boyfriend is just
telling you what you want to hear
so youll do things with him
Because he is Lauren Men tend to
say one thing and do another And
boys are just little men

(scribbling down a name)
Heres the name of a tutor If you
ever want to go to a college
without the word junior in front of
it I suggest you call him

As Sam crosses to open the door she hands her student the
number Lauren stands and flashes Sam her left ring finger

LAUREN
Kyle gave me a promise ring

SAM
Yeah well a promise isnt a
proposal now is it

Lauren exits and turns to say something else just as Sam
SLAMS the door on her face

INT BEAUTY SALON - LATER THAT DAY

A STYLIST works on Sam’s hair Its pretty big even by
Texas standards Sams younger sister ALEX 31 the mother

ALEX
Then well get a wide load sign and
a red dangly flag A proposal is
happening tonight Now we don’t

the kinda hand Wyatt plays-- Jonah

but bottom line is this hair has
got to go the distance and not one
inch less

SAM
Alex please Its fine He might
not even do it tonight You have
to be prepared for that

ALEX
Sam the only things I have to be
prepared for are hurricanes April
15th and the inevitable sex talk
with those three sperm donors

Sam thinks Alex might have a point

SAM
(to stylist)
We’re just looking for something
with a six- to eight-hour hold
Minimum

carnival The shotgun is properly mounted on its rack in the

INT BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

A BEAM OF MOONLIGHT is fixated on Sam She is wide awake
Wyatt SNORES next to her

The crinkled WATER FILTRATION SYSTEM BROCHURE is on the night
stand next to the clock The clock reads 1159

Sam still has hope Wyatt will do the right thing
The numbers LOUDLY FLIP to 1200 Anniversary over

All hope vanishes from Sam’s face The snoring is now
unbearable

INT BATHROOM - AN HOUR LATER

Sam grieves in the bathtub little wads of used tissue
surround her

The door handle turns

Sam stops mid-weep and waits Has he come to his senses
She holds her breath in anticipation

Wyatt half asleep enters in his underwear On automatic
pilot he lifts up the toilet seat and pees Completely
oblivious to the other person in the room He finishes his
business flushes and exits Seat still up

Sam is disgusted He didnt even wash his hands She hurls
a TISSUE at the door in frustration

It TRAVELS A TOTAL OF SIX INCHES then FLOATS to the ground
INT TRIXIES APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

Sam looks like shes been crying for hours Her best friend
TRIXIE 30s sits next to her Trixie cant hold down a job
or keep a boyfriend Its the curse of being too pretty she
says The two are having their way with a couple of wine
coolers

SAM
I just dont know what hes waiting
for I thought I was perfect for
him

TRIXIE
You are Quiet Non-confrontational
Obnoxiously loyal If I were you Id
make the shit shit or get off the pot
so someone else can
(off her look)
(MORE)

TRIXIE (contd)
What He’s a shit I think he
established that

SAM
Trixie I’m not gonna force Wyatt
into a wedding or a marriage or a
bowel movement It’s just not me

TRIXIE
Right You would rather sit around
and wait and hope and long and
torture yourself Fun

SAM
Its not torture Its patience

TRIXIE
Its delusional and you should have
a refillable prescription for it

Sam knows her best friend is right but still can’t deny her
feelings for the man

SAM
I’m sorry I love him I can’t
imagine my life without him He’s my
in case of emergency person

TRIXIE

How many emergencies are there
really Look I know you love him
I do But after ten years don’t
you gotta ask yourself why I
mean if he loved you the way you
love him would you’ve really been
on my doorstep at eight thirty in
the morning with Bartles or Jaymes

SAM
Eight fourteen I waited sixteen
minutes to knock so you wouldn’t
think I was a loser--

She loses it and SOBS into her hands

SAM
God I am such a loser

Trixie removes Sams hands from her face Black mascara is
everywhere

TRIXIE
You’re not a loser You’re just
too good for him

(MORE )

TRIXIE (contd)
Sometimes it’s hard to tell the
difference between the two

She spits on a napkin and tries to wipe away her friend’s
sadness

TRIXIE (CONT’D)
And Wyatt Its like Ive always
said just ‘cause a cockroach has
wings doesnt mean it can fly

SAM
I don’t know Seems like if a
cockroach has wings that’s exactly
what it means

TRIXIE
Not yours sweetie

Sam knows she must be right Trixie looks at her watch

SAM
I dont want to go

TRIXIE
Then you probably shouldntve rsvpd
yes and checked the beef Up

Trixie stands and helps Sam to her feet Something hideous
catches their eye

TRIXIE (CONT’D)
It’s not that bad

A really bad CANARY YELLOW BRIDESMAID DRESS hangs on the back
of the door

TRIXIE (CONTD)
But eleven more ounces could only
make it better

Trixie opens two fresh coolers and hands one to Sam The two
of them take a drink never taking their eyes off the beast

INT CHURCH - NOON

The church is lightly filled with TEXAS SEMI-FINEST Sam and
Alex both in the ugly yellow bridesmaid dresses wait at the
altar with the GROOM and his GROOMSMEN The RING BEARERS
Alex’s rambunctious twin boys follow a timid three-year-old
FLOWER GIRL down the aisle

Trixie sits in a pew next to Wyatt refusing to acknowledge
his existence Wyatt spots Sam and gives her a wave

Sam doesnt reciprocate Alex witnesses it all The
following exchange is spoken in varying levels of WHISPERS

ALEX
Ive warned you about this Sam

SAM
What-- What’re you talking about

ALEX
Men They need directions

SAM
Can we do this later

ALEX
They wont ask for them or read them
yet theyre completely lost without
them Thats where divine female
intervention comes in We give them
direction ‘cause if we didn’t
they’d be running around in circles
chasing their tails forever

SAM
We’re in the middle of our sister’s
wedding

ALEX

My point exactly Take Jerry

Alexs husband JERRY is in a pew wearing the baby in a Baby
Bjorn He’s busy getting gum off the bottom of his shoe with
his wedding program

ALEX
If it were up to him wed still be
living together testing the
waters You don’t test water
Sam You drink it or you flush it
end of story And Pete

PETE the nervous groom-to-be rocks back and forth in his
rented shoes His sweat is becoming a problem

ALEX
Do you think hed be standing here
today if Billie didnt do what she
had to do

BRIDAL MARCH BEGINS Everyone rises

SAM
(explodes )
Seriously
(off people’s looks)
Look The bride
(then in a harsh whisper
to Alex)
I am not going to do anything to
make Wyatt marry me so drop it

At the entrance of the church a BRIDE and her FATHER stand
Their silhouettes outlined in golden and blinding sunlight

ALEX
Grow up Sam This is Texas If
you dont somebody else will

The bride and her father glide down the aisle and into full
view revealing BELLIES the size of Texas One belongs to
BILLIE late 20s who is seven months pregnant but looks ten
the other LEO mid-50s likes a thick rib-eye

Alex becomes a little teary-eyed
ALEX
Look at her In my dress I’m

speechless Absolutely speechless

Sam is overcome with emotion For many reasons

SAM
(truly speechless)
I She Kleenex

Alex passes Sam’s extended hand a tissue as Leo helps his
enormous daughter climb the one step to the altar

SAM (VO)
As much as I didnt want to I
started to see Alexs tail-chasing
logic
EXT COUNTRY CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT

Sams very clean gently used Honda Accord pulls off the well-
lit premises and turns left into a SEA OF BLACKNESS

INT HONDA ACCORD

Wyatt comes to an intersection and takes a right Sam in the
passenger seat looks confused

SAM
Werent we supposed to take a left

WYATT
This is right

SAM
Let me just get the directions--

She turns on the overhead light to look through her purse
Wyatt snaps it off

WYATT
I don’t need directions

Silence fills the car

A small yellow road sign appears up ahead It gets bigger
and bigger It reads DEAD END

WYATT
(continuing ‘lightbulb’)
You know what it’s the other way

Wyatt turns the car around and heads in the other direction
SAM (VO)
It was finally clear Wyatt needed
me to do something
CUT TO
INT BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

Sam opens the medicine cabinet and takes out her BIRTH
CONTROL WHEEL It’s next to many boxes of floss

Saturdays pill is tucked neatly behind its little aluminum
foil door She pierces it and the pill pops out

Sam is about to put it in her mouth then doesn’t She lays
it down on the counter next to the sink and stares at it
The pill taunts her

Out of nowhere Sam SNEEZES

And sends the PILL INTO THE SINK It rolls toward the drain
and stops precariously on the edge It’s a miracle Sam
contemplates this miracle Then with the handle of her
toothbrush pushes the PILL over the edge and DOWN THE DRAIN

SAM
Oops

INT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Wyatt lies in bed with his eyes closed Sam now in a tiny
tank and boy shorts slips under the sheets next to him and
plants soft sensual kisses down his neck

Wyatt suspiciously opens an eye

WYATT
What’re you doin’

SAM
I flossed my teeth

She continues her seduction down his chest He stops her

WYATT
I dunno Sam Things really havent
been right between us lately

SAM
Yes they have

WYATT
You ran into the bathroom in tears
tonight

SAM
Weddings make me emotional you
know that

WYATT
Yeah but your sister was in the
middle of her bridesmaids’ speech

SAM
It wasn’t my favorite

WYATT

You mouthed the words ‘I’m so pissed
at you’ to me after that flower girl
intercepted the bouquet

SAM
Okay that was my bouquet
(then putting on a smile)
And what I said was ‘I’m so blissed
at you’ Haven’t you ever heard
that expression before

WYATT
No

SAM
It’s very popular Hallmark makes
a card
WYATT
Really
SAM
Probably-- Look I know we have our

ups and downs every now and then but
that’s what makes us great We work
through our issues and then we’re
better because of it So maybe
things haven’t been right lately so
what That just means our up is
right around the corner

(as she dispenses kisses)
Because bottom line we love
each other

She moves her kisses down to his belly Wyatt stops her

WYATT
(a confession)
Sam I had a lotta cake tonight

SAM
Good for you baby

She goes back to her stomach seduction He stops her again

WYATT
A lotta cake

Sams been down this road before with Wyatt and free food
Her attitude quickly shifts

SAM
How much cake are we talking Wyatt

WYATT
Well my piece your piece those crab
cakes in the beginning-- then there

SAM
There was grooms cake

WYATT
You were in the bathroom and I was
in a zone

Sam gets Wyatts message loud and clear and slugs him

WYATT
Ow-- I thought you werent pissed

only made it worse

Sam storms out Wyatt is clueless

WYATT
(calling off)
I snuck a piece out You can have
it-- HALF of it if you want--
Save me the rose

EXT SHERWOOD FOREST APARTMENT COMPLEX - MINUTES LATER

Sam sits on the apartment steps flossing her teeth Unable
to control her rage she throws her floss as hard as she can
It TRAVELS SIX INCHES and FLOATS to the ground

SAM (VO)
And then I heard the final straw
scream next door

A PIERCING SCREAM from next door

Sam looks around worried Unsure of its context she gets
up and presses her ear to her neighbors door Silence
Then another SCREAM LOUDER and LONGER

Sam gently KNOCKS

SAM
Caileen

which becomes a firm but concerned KNOCK

SAM
Caileen its Sam You okay

-which quickly segues into rapid knuckle-breaking please-
dont-cut-her-throat KNOCKING

SAM
(miming phone)
Dont worry Caileen Im calling
the police Right now Here I

The door opens CAILEEN P BAKERSFIELD in her early

petting a cranky cat

SAM
(practically in tears)
Uh-huh
INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sam closes the door with her back She’s in shock Self-
pity numbs every inch of her body

INT BEDROOM

She quietly packs a few things as Wyatt violently SNORES in
the background

INT KITCHEN
Sam writes a note

Dear Wyatt when its right you should know its right
Im sorry you dont Sam

She slides it under the piece of leftover cake from Billies
wedding on the kitchen table and exits

A beat

Sam returns SLAMS her fist down on the cake and exits again
EXT SHERWOOD FOREST APARTMENT COMPLEX

Sam carries a suitcase and a clear bag containing TWO GOLDFISH
down the stairs She crosses to the parking lot and passes
the dirty pick up truck

The license plate reads WYATTZ

Next to it her HONDA ACCORD

INT HONDA ACCORD

Sam looks for a place to rest the bag of fish but decides to
hold them instead Safety reasons

She straps on her seat belt puts the key in the ignition and
waits for her hand to start the car It wont She catches
her reflection in the rearview mirror She’s stalling

Deep breath Sam turns the key WHRR-RRR-RRR Nothing She
turns it again WHRR-RRR-RRR One more time WHRR-CLICK

Sam sees the HEADLIGHTS were left in the ON position

EXT SHERWOOD FOREST APARTMENT COMPLEX

WYATTZ LICENSE PLATE -- Sam’s foot kicks the fuck out of it

SAM (0S)
You are so stupid

Sam with her bag of fish attacks the personification of
Wyatt His truck Next up the TIRES

SAM
And chicken

Then driver’s SIDE DOOR

SAM
And wroooooo000000ng

She wrestles the SIDE MIRROR until it snaps
SAM
And completely undeserving of a

side mirror

Dirt covers her hand She writes FING WASH ME with her
finger on the hood

SAM
And MY GOD YOURE FREAKIN’ LAZY

Caught up in her fit she involuntarily whips the baggie of
fish at the truck’s windshield

SPLAT
The baggie breaks upon impact There are no survivors
The gravity of what Sam has just done sets in
SAM
(continuing crushed)
My babies
She scoops up one fish and cradles it in her hand She then

looks up at the other one on the windshield and something
behind it catches her eye And quiets the storm inside her

SAM (VO)
And then it hit me What was I
doing I wanted to leave and
punish Wyatt but all I was really
doing was punishing myself Wyatt
just needed a little direction

Sam spots the SHOTGUN IN THE GUN RACK
SAM (VO)
And I finally knew how to give it to
him
INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Sam is at the kitchen table eating the smashed cake She
has a new sense of purpose

SAM (VO)
But first I had to eat my cake
She opens her mouth for the last bite -- the ROSE
CUT TO

INT TRUCK - BACK TO PRESENT
THE SHOTGUN

Rests on Sam’s lap in the passenger seat It’s aimed at
Wyatt Wyatt’s not happy with this arrangement All the
WINDOWS ARE OPEN as Sam studies a highlighted road atlas

SAM
I can’t believe this is our first
road trip How come we’ve never done
this before-- Know what Doesn’t
matter The past is the past and the
future is well only eleven hundred
and thirty-two miles away

The rectangular box in the back seat catches Sam’s eye

SAM (CONT’D)
Oh shoot

She takes off her seat belt and starts to turn around

SAM (CONT’D)
Don’t look

With gun still on Wyatt Sam leans over the seat and opens
the box A WEDDING DRESS is compactly folded inside She
takes it out Its a beautiful white wrinkled mess

SAM (CONTD)
Dangit

She straightens it out as best she can then replaces a jacket
that was hanging on a hanger with the dress It is directly
behind Wyatt’s seat

REARVIEW MIRROR Wyatt SEES the dress and winces

His eyes return to the road as Sam turns around and puts her
seat belt back on

SAM (CONTD)
It’ll be fine--

She turns the rearview mirror towards her

SAM (CONTD)
If you don’t use this anymore--

Sam notices her wedding dress THRASH about in the back from
the wind

SAM (CONTD)
And baby-- the windows

Wyatt silently and angrily closes all windows

SAM (CONT’D)

Thank you

(a long awkward beat)
Look Wy I know youre mad at me
and I dont blame you I mean I
blame you but not for being mad at
me It’s just-- You really didn’t
give me any choice

WYATT
(loses it)
I gave you-- I gave you no choice--
I woke up eskimo-kissing a firearm--
my firearm and I gave you no
choice Have you lost your mind

SAM
Yes and yes

WYATT
Come again

SAM
I kidnapped you I think I’m sane
enough to know how crazy this is
I’m also sane enough to know it had
to be done I mean Caileen P
Bakersfield got engaged after only
three months Three months Wyatt

WYATT
Who

SAM
The fat cat lady in 3B The point
is the sooner you realize all I’m
doing is helping you take that leap
of faith the better

WYATT
The only thing you’re helping me do
is lose my job

SAM
Home Depot is not going to fire
you

WYATT

Im sorry I didnt realize you were
the regional manager in charge of all
hirings and firings in my store

SAM
Wyatt youve been there longer
than anybody else You’ve gotta
have some sort of job security and
besides even if you didnt
maybe itd be for the best

WYATT
Here comes the why have a job when
you can have a career speech

SAM
No speech Its just-- You
havent had a raise in forever and
maybe youre just a little too
comfortable in a job thats really
going nowhere And yeah okay
why waste your time on a job when
you can just as easily focus your
energy on a career

WYATT
I am senior assistant manager at the
world’s largest home improvement

Sam hands him the cell phone

WYATT
Nuh-huh no way

SAM
It’s ringing

WYATT
I’m not taking that phone

SAM
Okay but it’s your phone and we’re
roaming

Wyatt grabs the phone from her to hang up

SAM
I wouldn’t do that if I were you
My father has caller ID and the
only thing he hates more than guys
who won’t marry his daughters are
crank callers

Wyatt’s screwed and he knows it

SAM
Just speak from the heart

Sam hands Wyatt a 3 x 5 index card as he puts the phone to
his ear

SAM
And this card Words underlined
should be emphasized

He swerves the car to save his nipples

WYATT

whole other side About how we

Wyatt looks at her NAKED RING FINGER Sam follows his gaze
EXT HIGHWAY

Their truck abruptly veers off and exits the freeway An
OUTLET MALL is in the distance

EXT DIAMOND DISCOUNT CENTER

An empty parking space in front is filled with Wyatts truck

INT TRUCK

Wyatt puts the truck in park as Sam moves her promise ring
from her middle finger on her left hand to her middle finger
on her right hand Sam turns to Wyatt

SAM
I’m ready

WYATT
I dont have that kinda money on

WYATT

Sam sticks her head back in the car

SAM

WYATT

(off her look)
I tried to buy a muffler yesterday

SAM
(wild-eyed)

WYATT
Hey I need a new muffler

INT DIAMOND DISCOUNT CENTER - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

Sam and Wyatt stand at the entrance of the store He wears a
baseball cap a jacket and Sam’s sunglasses A FINGER GUN is
in his pocket Sam with a veil covering her face has her
SHOTGUN TRAINED ON WYATT A poor man’s Bonnie and Clyde

Sam nudges Wyatt with her gun

WYATT
(halfheartedly)
Okay people thiss a hold up

SAM
(in a harsh whisper)
George we talked about this If you
want them to take you seriously
youre gonna have to put a little
feeling in it

WYATT
I think they take me seriously Sam

SAM
It’s Martha and I’m not seeing it

The store has a FEW CUSTOMERS in it and a COUPLE EMPLOYEES
All completely unaware of the robbery in progress

Wyatt now aware and peeved he’s being ignored puts his
finger and thumb to his mouth and lets out an EAR-PIERCING
WHISTLE

WYATT
HEY Y’all are being robbed so why
don’t you do me a favor and start
acting like it

The customers and sales clerks dramatically REACT Wyatt
powerless for the past few hours enjoys this

WYATT (CONTD)
That’s what I’m talkin’ about
Now chew the floor

Confused nobody moves

WYATT (CONTD)
(explaining)
Down on the ground

As everyone drops to the ground Wyatt looks to Sam for her
approval She’s visibly impressed They are interrupted by a
CLERK standing behind the counter He could be the manager
could be the employee of the month -- hard to tell with his
arms up so high in the air

STORE CLERK
Excuse me--

WYATT
Jesus Chrysler I am talking about
lying horizontal on the carpet

STORE CLERK
Yes sir Got that with ‘chew the
floor’ Very clever Just thought

upright Y’know open jewelry cases

WYATT
Well now I spose I do
(reading tag)

LARRY
It’s short for Lawrence And just
so you know I’m not gonna try to
be a hero or anything Our company
manual specifically advises against
such actions

Larrys nemesis STEVE THE OVERWEIGHT CO-WORKER lying
prostrate on the ground can’t help but add his two cents

STEVE
(muffled cough)

(ignoring Steve)
So where you wanna start Watches

LARRY
(to Steve instantly hot)
Oh and I suppose you think all fat
women are pregnant

SAM
Actually Larry we are getting
married

LARRY

(back to Sam)
Well why didn’t you say so Every
engaged couple who crosses our
threshold gets two free glasses of
champagne in our embossed keepsake
Diamond Discount Center flutes
These are the moments after all

Wyatt firms up his finger gun Larry notices

LARRY
Or not See anything

WYATT
How ‘bout that one

Wyatt points to one of the less impressive rings in the case

LARRY
This one Really

WYATT
It’s fine

Sam looks over his shoulder at the ring in question

SAM

Fine George I dont want fine
WYATT

SAM

We’re not holding up this place for

WYATT
(to Larry)

expectations

Larry notices the MOLE on Wyatt’s neck Wyatt sees this and
covers it with his free hand

SAM
(re another ring)
That ones pretty

LARRY
One and a half carats of pretty to
be exact

WYATT

(wanting to disappear)
Whatever fine we don’t have all day

EXT DIAMOND DISCOUNT CENTER

Sam and Wyatt sprint out of the store She carries their two
keepsake flutes as he concentrates on hiding his mole with his
jacket

Larry waves bye to Sam and Wyatt as he reaches down and
presses a RED BUTTON

A SCREECHING ALARM goes off
Sam knows Larry is just doing his job as Wyatt puts the truck

in reverse He automatically goes to adjust the rearview
mirror Sam stops him

SAM
(re mirror)
No you don’t I’d rather have no
luck than bad luck

Wyatt reverses with the aid of his broken side mirror

EXT BACK ROAD - LATER

Off the beaten path The pick-up truck -- the only vehicle
INT TRUCK

Sam still wearing the veil takes pictures of her new ring
On the dashboard in the air on her leg etc It’s at least
one size too big but she’s too smitten by it to notice

SAM
I love my new ring Wyatt

WYATT
Well enjoy it while you still got
it When the law gets us the only
jewelry youre gonna be wearing comes
with tiny keys and a wrist rash

SAM
Do you mind

WYATT
Hey you saw the way Larry was looking
at my mole Betcha hes telling a
sketch artist all about it right

INT DIAMOND DISCOUNT CENTER - SAME TIME
Larry talks to a SKETCH ARTIST

LARRY
-here Exactly two inches from
his earlobe Do you have a ruler

SKETCH ARTIST

LARRY
Well that’s about right but more in
the shape of Texas The Pan Handle
region was real irregular You know
if I were him I’d get that thing
looked at asap

Steve stands behind them drinking a diet cola
STEVE
It wasnt that big

LARRY
Excuse me you werent face to face
with George like I was My life
flashed before my eyes

STEVE
Did it suck

INT TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
Sam puts the camera back in her purse

SAM
We just took one little ring Why
would the police care about one
little ring

WYATT
You were armed and we robbed
Thats what youd call armed
robbery Sam Way I figure youll
get three to four for that and two
to three for the kidnapping Now
the fish--

em

Sam has the gun and her eyebrow raised and AIMED at him

SAM
I suggest you leave the fish out of
this Wyatt

WYATT
(sotto)
And you wonder why we never go on
road trips
The truck then CHOKES A beat More CHOKING

SAM
What was that

WYATT
Probably my muffler

It CHOKES again

SAM
Were not out of gas are we

WYATT
The lights not on

Sam sees the gauge is on EMPTY The truck is practically
coasting

SAM
Wyatt were on E

WYATT
So The lights not on I dont
get gas until the light goes on

SAM
Doesnt the E mean anything to
you

WYATT

Not when the lights not on
The GASOLINE LIGHT POPS ON and the car rolls to a stop
EXT BACK ROAD - IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
Sam exits the car and SLAMS the door Wyatt gets out too

WYATT
Whats wrong with you

SAM
You never take care of anything
until you absolutely have to

WYATT
My warning light just came on

SAM
And mines been on FOREVER

WYATT
Okay calm down We’1ll get some gas--

If Sam were a cartoon character steam would come out of her
ears now Her anger carries her into the middle of the road

SAM
This isnt about the gas This is
about this This wasnt supposed to
be like this It has been TEN YEARS

WYATT
You seem to be forgetting that I
thought it was our nine-year--

SAM
Nine years ten years light years
It doesn’t matter The number
would’ve never made a difference

WYATT
You dont know that

SAM
(gesticulating like crazy)
Actually Wyatt that is the only
thing I do know and you know why
Because you may have wings but you
will NEVER be able to fly with them

And just like that HER ENGAGEMENT RING FLIES OFF and into
the air it LANDS in the middle of the two-lane highway and
proceeds to BOUNCE down the center stripe
SAM (CONTD)
(barely audible)

My ring
THE RING continues on its journey down the middle of the
road towards the HORIZON just as a FUEL TANKER TRUCK rises
up in the distance
SAM cant believe her eyes

THE TANKER TRUCK gets closer

The RING SPINS to a standstill Exactly where tires will
roll The sun catches the diamond and a FLASH of light

Hits SAM in the eye She blinks then takes off RUNNING down
the middle of the road After her ring Toward the gas
truck With her shotgun In her veil As fast as she can
WYATT doesn’t know what to do
WYATT

Sam What’re you-- You know I’m

no good with blood
SAM -- her only focus is saving the ring

THE TANKER TRUCK gets closer to Sam

SAM gets closer to the ring

A SHADOW surrounded by the bright ethereal glow of the sun

COWBOY
Hey there

SAM
Are you God

Cowboy squats down and Sam sees him for the first time

COWBOY
If I were God you really think Id
be driving a truck for a living

SAM
Jesus was a carpenter

COWBOY
Yeah well so was Tim Allen but I’m
not him either And youre not dead
Lucky for you I got a great deal on
brakes yesterday

Cowboy offers Sam his hand and helps up Feeling self
conscious she takes off her veil

SAM
I can’t believe I jumped in front
of your truck like that-- My ring
fell off I just got engaged
It’s a size six I’ma size five
The hints were there I don’t know
why I’m telling you this

COWBOY
Hey I have a wife I know all
about hints

SAM
Thank you

There is a hint of a connection Then Cowboy sees Wyatt in
the distance Wyatt WAVES Cowboy waves back

COWBOY
Is that your fiance

Sam glances at Wyatt back at the truck

SAM
That’s him

Cowboy sees Wyatt wave again But harder

COWBOY
Is he having a seizure

Sam looks again and sees Wyatt is trying to signal for help
She turns back to Cowboy to wrap it up

SAM
No Just an enthusiastic waver--
Real friendly guy I should
probably go--

(MORE)

SAM (contd)
(re watch)
We got a thing

Cowboy picks up her SHOTGUN off the road and hands it to her

COWBOY
You need this for it

SAM
I do It’s a hunting thing
(off his look)
I hunt

COWBOY
I see Can I give you a lift

SAM
Oh no Thanks The truck it’s
just right back there--

COWBOY
I was talking about to wherever
your fella there’s headed
Sam looks back at their vehicle and sees Wyatt is hightailing
it down the road away from both them and the pick up She
turns back to Cowboy

SAM
Would you mind

INT TANKER TRUCK

Cowboys driving Sams got her eye on Wyatt whos running
way ahead on the side of the road They pass Wyatt’s truck
on the shoulder

COWBOY
You guys have a break down

SAM
You could say that

EXT BACK ROAD

The tanker truck is closing in on Wyatt Sam sticks her head
out the window

SAM

Wyatt continues to run

WYATT
(to Cowboy )

Sam looks at Cowboy
SAM
He’s not so good with heat Or

a list

COWBOY
You ran out of gas I got gas

EXT BACK ROAD
Sam sticks her head out the window again With her weapon
SAM

Wyatt sees Sams gun surreptitiously aimed at him Shes
Tommy Lee Jones hes the fugitive He slows down to a walk
exhausted but relentless

WYATT
Call The Pol--

INT TANKER TRUCK
Sam quickly rolls up the window as the truck comes to a stop
SAM
That’s just the dehydration
talking

Cowboy hands her a gallon of gas from behind her seat

COWBOY
Here you go

SAM
Oh great How much do we owe--

COWBOY
I’m guessing you didnt see the
sixty thousand gallons of gasoline
that I wear like a backpack

SAM
This is a gas truck isn’t it

COWBOY
It ain’t a compact

SAM
Ha Well thank you

Sam reaches out for a handshake

COWBOY
Cowboy

They shake hands as Sam ponders him and his name

COWBOY (CONT’D)
Like the guys with the Indians I
was one once in elementary school
It stuck

SAM
Sam As in Uncle We weren’t
allowed to wear costumes in school--

Cowboy has a concerned look on his face as he stares out of
Sam’s window She follows his gaze

Wyatt’s hyperventilating into his SOCK

SAM (CONTD)
(explaining)
Middle child I better go

Sam smiles and hops out of the truck

COWBOY
Hey before I forget congratulations
(off her clueless look)
On your engagement

SAM
Right Getting married Yay me

EXT BACK ROAD

As the TANKER TRUCK disappears in the distance Sam and Wyatt
walk down the empty road The gun is wedged in Wyatts spine

WYATT
I was gonna come back

SAM
(incensed)
Oh I know all about your gonnas

INT TRUCK - NEAR DUSK

Wyatt exhausted from his attempted escape drives as Sam
sits next to him seething her eyes glued to the empty road
in front of her The gun in her lap is equally as fixated on
Wyatt

WYATT
Hey look a rest stop

Nothing
MINUTES LATER --
Silence

WYATT
I could eat

Nothing
MINUTES LATER --
More deafening silence Wyatt tries to swallow but can’t

WYATT
I think I just lost the ability to
make spit

SAM
Spit Now you’re crying about
spit I just about lost the
ability to be a walking breathing
human being back there and you’re
worried about your stupid saliva
production I almost died Wyatt
Doesnt that mean anything to you
After all these years doesnt my
almost death mean anything to you

WYATT
Of course it does But c’mon
Sam You didnt

SAM
How would you even know

WYATT
Well for starters--

SAM
For starters I could be lying
on the road all bloody and run
over and dead and if it werent
for me chasing you down youd be
halfway to Mexico by now

WYATT
Mexico You know how I feel about
Mexico--

SAM

THIS ISN’T ABOUT MEXICO

An explosion of tears

WYATT
Hey I’m not the one who brought up
Mexico-- Look I know I got some

issues with commitment and the
future and forever and yes Mexico
but I’m not the kinda guy whod
leave you in the middle of the road
if I thought you were dead Or
almost dead That guy’s a real
jackass

SAM
Yes you are I don’t even know why
I’m bothering with you anymore

WYATT
Don’t say that

SAM
Why It’s true If you loved me--
if you really loved me you wouldn’t
be putting me through all this

Shes a mess Wyatt’s uncomfortable with the frenzy of
feelings as well as her uptight finger on the trigger

WYATT
Not necessarily-- I mean just cause
you’re over there and you’re armed
and angry and I’m over here gunless
and well kidnapped doesn’t mean I
don’t love you

These unsolicited words catch Sams attention

SAM
Whatd you just say

WYATT
Gunless isn’t a word is it

SAM
No After that

WYATT
‘Doesn’t mean I dont love you’

SAM
That What do you mean by that

WYATT
(answering a pop quiz)
I love you

SAM
(a sudden calmness)
Still

Sam removes her finger from the trigger This does not go
unnoticed by Wyatt

WYATT
Yes

SAM
Then why All these years why

WYATT
In alphabetical order Guess I was
afraid of losing my freedom and
independence--

SAM
Those are the same things Wyatt

WYATT
The point is people can change
Sam

He reaches over and puts his hand on hers The one with the
ring on it The one on the gun

WYATT
You just gotta let ‘em

A DINER is up ahead Wyatt and Sam both spot it

WYATT
And then you gotta let ‘em pee

A beat
SAM
Okay

Wyatt smiles victoriously as he turns into the parking lot

EXT DINER

The get-away truck pulls up next to the side of the building

By the dumpsters Out of sight

(suddenly distrusting)
That’s not to say at one time he
wasnt a little nervous about the
whole idea Because he was

Really nervous And apprehensive
Wasn’t really into it--

Wyatt senses Sam’s on a downward spiral
WYATT
But that was yesterday Sam Todays
today Remember baby

SAM
Oh I remember

Bitter Bette looks him up and down
BITTER BETTE
Yep Don’t trust him
(then to Sam)
Still one at a time

WYATT
Hey rules are rules

Bitter Bette crosses off as Sam stares at Wyatt

WYATT
Rules are rules I didn’t make that
up

SAM

What about what you said in the car
Wyatt That you changed-- That you
were ready to get married-- That you
loved me-- Did you happen to make any
of that up

WYATT

What-- No C’mon Sam you’ve known
her for like ten seconds You’ve
known me for ten years She’s just a
bitter ol’ waitress with a bitter ol’
pot of coffee Baby seriously If
you can’t trust me the man you’re
about to marry who can you trust

Wyatt makes a valid point Sam has no choice but to get

SAM
You’re right

it

She crosses into the bathroom and closes the door Right
before it shuts she opens it again for one last thought

SAM (CONTD)
Thank you

WYATT
Thank me in there You’re not the
only one with a bladder here

Sam goes back in and locks the door At the first sound of
TINKLING Wyatt takes off for the exit

Bitter Bette wiping down the counter confronts Wyatt

BITTER BETTE
Well well well look who doesn’t have
a bladder

Wyatt spins around to see who shes talking to The old
tattered local just looks at him as he sips his coffee and
cigarette

WYATT
Mind your own business lady

He grabs a biscuit off some dishes at an empty table shoves
it in his mouth and continues on his way

An OFF-STAGE SHOTGUN is cocked

BITTER BETTE (0S)
Call me Bette

Wyatt stops mid-flee and mid-bite and turns around
Bitter Bette has a SHOTGUN pointed at him

WYATT
(with mouth full)
For fucks sake its just a lousy
old biscuit

BITTER BETTE
Save your sweet talk for someone
who cares

Wyatt realizes how serious this situation is

WYATT
Okay you know what Bette you got
it all wrong First of all this
ain’t no hunting trip

BITTER BETTE
Why don’t you tell the bitter ol’
waitress something she doesn’t
know

WYATT
Look You don’t have all the facts--
I am younger than she is

BITTER BETTE
So

WYATT
So I don’t like whose side you seem
to be on here so I’m gonna go

He turns to leave

BITTER BETTE
Go ahead but don’t be surprised if
you find a bullet lodged up your ass
on the way out

WYATT
She kidnapped me Against my will
She killed my fish

BITTER BETTE
You insulted my biscuit

INT DINER - NIGHT
Sam and Wyatt finish eating in silence Then

WYATT
I am a tall man Sam I was in
that truck for a long time Can’t
a tall man who was in a truck for a
long time stretch his legs every
now and then

Bitter Bette comes over with a pot of coffee and an answer

BITTER BETTE
No
(to Sam)
Coffee

Wyatt holds up his empty cup Bitter Bette ignores him
SAM

Better not We’re gonna be holding
it from here on out

BITTER BETTE
Nothing wrong with that
(to Wyatt filling up his
cup)
Drink up Buttercup

SAM
We’1ll just take the bill

Sam gestures for Wyatt to get out his wallet

BITTER BETTE
(waving her off)
Pffftft

SAM
No
(gesturing again)
Wyatt

Wyatt apprehensively takes out his wallet

WYATT
She said ‘pfffff’

BITTER BETTE
(to Sam)
The egg scrambles are overpriced for
a reason and trust me it is not
because of the quality of the eggs

Wyatt looks at his empty plate then pushes it away

SAM
Well thank you Thats real nice

BITTER BETTE
No whats nice is you making one
of these cowards step up to the
plate and do the right thing

WYATT
The right thing You wouldn’t know
the right thing if it walked in
here and ordered an egg scramble
I feel sick

BITTER BETTE
Good

Bitter Bette takes off a necklace with a WEDDING BAND draped
on it and offers it to Sam

BITTER BETTE (CONT’D)
Here Something old from someone old

SAM
Bette I cant take this

BITTER BETTE

(re Wyatt)
If you can take that you can take
this
SAM

No really-- Is this platinum

BITTER BETTE
It was my mama’s She wore it for
fifty-eight years Always thought
it would happen for me but well

Sam accepts the necklace from Bitter Bette

SAM
It sounds like it was good luck

Bitter Bette helps Sam put on the necklace
BITTER BETTE

It was Until my dog of a father

their fifty-ninth anniversary
EXT DINER - NIGHT
It’s dark The neon diner sign provides the only light

MINUTES LATER --

SAMS FOOT is wrapped in bandages made out of Wyatt’s shirt
and propped up on the to go bag

She lies flat on her back on the gravel Wyatt is next to
her shirtless Both a little spent from the experience

SAM
That was your favorite shirt

WYATT
It was either wrap your foot in it or
pass out in it Any way I sliced it
the shirt was goin’ down

SAM
still

Sam realizes that she doesn’t have the gun on Wyatt and he’s
still there Maybe he was just afraid of losing his freedom
and independence Wyatt notices her staring at him

WYATT
So how you feelin’

SAM
Pretty much like I was shot in the
foot and am now lying in parking
lot full of gravel

WYATT
I could put you in the truck

SAM
In a minute It’s kinda nice to
just sit here and talk If you
don’t count the fifty or so jagged
little rocks poking into my head

WYATT
Here

Wyatt grabs her purse lifts her head and slides it under
It’s the little things that get Sam and it shows

WYATT (CONT’D)
You know I’m sorry--

SAM

WYATT
It’s just-- I feel bad

SAM
Don’t
WYATT
I just need you to know it was an
accident and well--

SAM
Accidents happen I know

WYATT
Okay

They share a moment Just like old times Then
WYATT (CONTD)
(suddenly guiltless)
Ill see you later then
Wyatt abruptly stands and makes a run for it

SAM
Wait-- Wyatt-- Where’re you goin’--

Sam lifts her head and across the empty parking lot sees

him sprint behind the building
SAM (CONT’D)
Wyatt You can’t leave me I’m
your fiancee-- I have a GUN
The GUN is too far to reach
SAM
(weakly)
Right over there
Alone Frustrated Throbbing Sam starts to cry
CRUNCHING GRAVEL

Sam opens her eyes and sees that Wyatt is back

SAM

INT BITTER BETTES TRAILER - LATER

A POLICE SCANNER quietly squawks on the kitchen counter

FEMALE DISPATCHER (VO)
‘All units we are still UTL on
that 211 Be on the lookout for
two suspects One a Caucasian
woman in a veil in her mid- to late-
thirties--’

Bitter Bette with a gloved hand CLICKS OFF the scanner and
returns to dunking a needle in and out of boiling water with
a pair of tongs Sam resting on the couch with a cold

washcloth on her forehead and foot elevated lifts her head

SAM
Did she just say late-thirties

BITTER BETTE
Different 211

Sam puts her head back down deep in thought

SAM
I can’t believe this is my life I
just don’t get it Why is Wyatt
making this so difficult

BITTER BETTE
Because they all do Now just sit
tight and let the Tylenol PM do
your thinking

SAM
Are you sure he’s okay

BITTER BETTE
Sugar hes fine I’ve done this a
million times

SAM
I just don’t want him to be
uncomfortable I mean I know he’s
a liar and a jerk and I can’t trust
him but he’s still my fiance

INT CLOSET

Bitter Bette opens the door tongs in hand Inside is a
shirtless agitated Wyatt tied to a chair A bandana around
his mouth prevents him from talking

INT BITTER BETTES TRAILER - LATER

Sam is asleep on the couch Bitter Bette covers her and her
newly bandaged foot with a blanket and heads to her room down

from the closet It gets louder and louder Then

THUD

The closet door whips open and Wyatt still tied to the chair
and gagged falls forward on his face Hes awake now

WYATT
Whammff tff fucmph

Wyatt lifts his head off the carpet and suddenly remembers
where he is

On the couch is Sam deep in her Tylenol PM-induced sleep

Wyatt looks around the room and sees a PAIR OF SCISSORS on
the table next to Sam He smiles wickedly As much as one
can smile wickedly with a bandana tied around his mouth

INT BITTER BETTES TRAILER - THE NEXT MORNING

A MUG OF COFFEE is set on the coffee table in front of Sam
She is just waking up

SAM
Oh good Coffee
(takes a sip)
Yep that’s the stuff

BITTER BETTE
Its pretty much what keeps the
regulars coming back Well that

Bitter Bette realizes her cleavage is less than impressive at
this hour

BITTER BETTE (CONT’D)
I have to be in the right bra Or
a bra-- So todays the day huh

SAM
Yeah I guess it is I can’t
believe it

BITTER BETTE
Well you better believe it ‘cause

Bitter Bette opens the curtains A PERFECT DAY pours into
the pre-fab living room The bluest of blue skies not a
cloud as far as the eye can see and are those songbirds

BITTER BETTE (CONT’D)
-and in my front yard

There is no front yard

Bitter Bette turns around just in time to see the screen door
swing shut

EXT BITTER BETTES TRAILER - A MINUTE LATER
A handful of MELODIOUS BIRDS fly past overhead

Sam stands in the middle of the dirt driveway transfixed
Bitter Bette appears on her steps with her first aid tackle
box

BITTER BETTE
I didn’t mean literally in my front
yard

SAM
This-- This is my dream day

BITTER BETTE
Here we go

SAM
The sky it’s the perfect blue
Not a cloud as far as the eye can
see-- And did you hear those birds

BITTER BETTE
Only every morning ten minutes
before my alarm goes off

SAM
Do you know I’ve been dreaming
about this day since I was six
years old and it has always looked
exactly like this

BITTER BETTE
Do you know you got driveway all
over my wrap job

Sam looks down and sees her bandaged foot is dirty She hops
over to Bitter Bette and sits on her steps

SAM
Sorry It’s just--

BITTER BETTE
This is your dream day I heard

Bitter Bette not wanting to engage in this conversation
begins redressing Sam’s wound Sam notices

SAM
Is something wrong

BITTER BETTE
Yeah I’m all out of medium You
want large or small

Bitter Bette holds up two rolls of wrapping tape

SAM
Surprise me I don’t mean to pry
but don’t you believe in dreams

BITTER BETTE
I didn’t grow up dreaming I’d be
single and slinging coffee for a
living so no

SAM
Well I do I had to My mother
died when I was six

BITTER BETTE
Shug That’s terrible

SAM
She left me and my sisters two
things when she died A note and
her wedding dress

Sam pulls a folded up piece of paper out of her back pocket
and hands it to Bitter Bette

SAM (CONTD)
The wedding dress is in the truck

Bitter Bette unfolds the paper The worn creases indicate
it’s been opened and closed numerous times

BITTER BETTE
(reading)
‘My darling daughters
(MORE)

BITTER BETTE (contd)
Live laugh learn -- and promise
me one thing That you’ll find
someone who loves you as much as
your daddy loves me and when you
do youll marry him in my dress
That way I can be there too
Until then I love you Mom’

Bitter Bette is caught off guard by her emotional response to
this letter She carefully folds it and hands it back

BITTER BETTE (CONT’D)
Well that’s just beautiful I s’pose
just like this day So you gonna be
the first to wear it or last

SAM
Both My two sisters were too far
in their third trimesters to even
look at it

BITTER BETTE
Good

Sam smiles until something across the road catches her eye
The smile disappears

SAM
(instantly hurt)

Sam is slumped at the kitchen table with a plate of eggs a
bottle of whiskey and a shot glass in front of her Bitter
Bette angrily cooks bacon

SAM
I’m not hungry I’m too stupid to

BITTER BETTE
Stop saying that and start drinking

around here cut my good rope and
escaped

Sam pours herself a shot and slams it back

SAM
I just don’t know what I thought I
was doing

BITTER BETTE
I do You were going after what was
rightfully yours Sam A wedding
Your wedding

SAM
I know but why Wyatt and I there
was no momentum left We were
just together Not moving
forward or growing or progressing
Our relationship was dead in the
water Sharks shouldve eaten it

BITTER BETTE
Don’t be too sure about that I
work in a diner I know things
His name was Roy

SAM
Was Roy a couples’ therapist

BITTER BETTE
Janitor in ER He once told me
about this woman who fell off a
horse All the equipment and the
doctors they all said she was dead
Fifteen minutes later Roy was in
there cleaning up whatever that good
for nothing cleaned up and
accidentally bumped her gurney with
his mop The woman popped back to

INT TANKER TRUCK - AN HOUR LATER
Sam looks at her watch defeated and mentally disheveled

SAM
This has got to be the worst
engagement ever I now only have
three hours to find my dress track
down my groom and get to the chapel
-- where let’s not forget there’1l
be a crate full of doves just waiting
to crap on me Oh great I say
‘crap’ now

BITTER BETTE
Honey I’m sure a lot of brides
feel like you do
(off her look)
What do I know

Sam is not doing well And everyone knows it

COWBOY
What do you want to do

SAM
Besides cry and feel sorry for
myself and cry some more This
Whether he likes it or not Wyatt
is going to do the right thing
Doves are not returnable

BITTER BETTE
It’s like you’re my flesh and
blood

Cowboy thinks about what Sam just said Sam notices

SAM
What

COWBOY
Maybe this isn’t the right thing

SAM
I’m sorry

COWBOY
I’ve been thinking

SAM
Well stop it

BITTER BETTE
Yeah knock it off

SAM
(then to Cowboy)
Okay what do you mean maybe this
isn’t the right thing

COWBOY
It just struck me Why do you want
to be with someone who doesn’t want
to be with you

This hits Sam hard She swings back

SAM
Why do you

Sam and Cowboy are both left speechless

BITTER BETTE
Good God why does anyone Now if
youre done seeing whose tears are
wetter there’s something up ahead
one o’clock

Up a mile or so a BILLOWY FLUFF OF WHITE is on side of road
occasionally moving with what breeze there is

Sam leans forward

SAM
What is it

BITTER BETTE
Well now I’m not sure

And then Bitter Bette is

BITTER BETTE (CONT’D)
Probably just someone’s old sheet--
(changing topic)
So what were we talking about

SAM
A sheet Why would there be a
sheet in the desert I can’t look

Sam covers her eyes Cowboy brings the truck to a stop

COWBOY
Sam I don’t think that’s a sheet

SAM
Is it

BITTER BETTE
Does it have intricate beading on
the bodice

SAM
With one hundred and twelve hand-
sewn beads

Bitter Bette starts silently counting

BITTER BETTE
Gimme a minute

EXT TANKER TRUCK

Sams face against the window sees her dead dress A
MUFFLED SCREAM

A HALF HOUR LATER --
THE WEDDING DRESS

Is still on the side of the road Covered in dirt tire
marks road junk Caught in a bare brown desert bush

Sam stands over it looking as if she’s just stumbled upon
Mass grave Her friends wait by the truck After another
second Cowboy walks over

SAM
Go away I’m mad at you

COWBOY
Hate to disappoint you but it’s
not me you’re mad at

He bends down and extracts the dress from the bush

SAM
It looks like it was dragged to
death

COWBOY

Looks like it was a lot of things
to death

Cowboy stops himself

COWBOY (CONT’D)

You know what Maya Angelou always
says

(off her look)
I drive a truck for ten to twelve
hours a day If someone’s made a
book on tape I’ve listened to it
twice Maya says you can tell a
lot about a person by how they
handle three things tangled
Christmas tree lights the rain
and lost luggage--

SAM
Cowboy please--

COWBOY
Now haven’t seen you with a box of
Christmas lights or deal with rain
but I have see you lose a few
things A ring and a human to name
two And I have to say no one
handles it better

SAM
Better Better than what

COWBOY
Well better than me for one

Sam doesn’t know what to make of Cowboy
INT TANKER TRUCK

Cowboy and Sam wait in the cab Each in their own thought
The dress carcass hangs in the back Bitter Bette opens the
door and climbs in

BITTER BETTE
Well couldn’t find any of those
beads Chewed up old toothpicks on
the other hand I could build a
house

SAM
Cowboy

COWBOY
I know the drill Doves aren’t
returnable--
SAM
Can you drive me to Vegas It’s
time to tell my family the truth

BITTER BETTE
What-- No We can’t give up

SAM
Were not I am This is a lose
lose situation If I continue on
this wild goose chase and force
Wyatt to marry me I’1l end up like
Cowboy And if I don’t I’m you

BITTER BETTE
Gee thanks

Silence Bitter Bette is about to speak but thinks twice
about it Then can’t stop herself

BITTER BETTE
Okay I have to say something

SAM
I wish you wouldn’t

BITTER BETTE
Yeah well I wish you didn’t say
what you just did back there but you
did so we’re even Look forget
about me and my agenda and forget
about the World’s Most Sensitive
Truck Driver over there I just
don’t want you to forget about your
dream Sam

SAM
That’s just it I think it’s time I
did I cant keep chasing someone
who doesnt want to be caught
These spoken words sink in for both Sam and Cowboy

Maude knows that crumpled up face anywhere
EXT GAS STATION

Harry and Wyatt sit on a curb by the store watching the BUS
DRIVER sharing Cheetos Wyatt’s duffel bag is between them

WYATT
Where’d y’all get this bus anyway

HARRY
Some famous skateboarder Our
church got it for practically
nothing when he shattered his knee
Lucky us huh

MAUDE (0S)
Oh I think Wyatt’s the lucky one

Maude joins them and produces the wrinkled flyer

MAUDE
Can you believe he ran away from
her Look how cute they are

WYATT
She made a flyer-- ‘Course she did
She kidnapped me Why wouldn’t she
make a flyer Can I see that please

Maude hands Wyatt the flyer and he stuffs it deep in his bag

MAUDE
Wait you need medication--

WYATT
I don’t--

As Harry shoves his hand into Wyatt’s bag and pulls out what
he thinks is the flyer and hands it to his wife

WYATT
Hey

MAUDE
(re paper)
Harry this ain’t it

Harry reaches to take it back Maude slaps his hand

MAUDE
Go away These are wedding vows

Harry glances suspiciously at Wyatt

MAUDE
(reading)
They’re Sams
(to Wyatt)
Ten years You made your fiancee
wait ten years

WYATT
No-- Yes-- She’s not my fiancee
Look I know this is your
anniversary and your skateboarder
bus and I really appreciate you
splitting your Cheetos Harry but--
what is wrong with you people I
was kidnapped With a gun
Against my will I was a state
away from being forced into a ‘til
death do you part’ situation and
you two keep turnin’ this into a
Hallmark Hall of Fame movie

MAUDE
Knowing how much she loves you it
would make a good one

WYATT
It’s not love it’s insanity

HARRY
True love does make you do crazy
things

MAUDE

Thats the only reason that can
explain why youre sitting here
with us and not standing at an

altar with her

Frustrated Wyatt grabs the vows and shoves them back in his
bag As he does his bag falls off the curb An embossed
keepsake flute ROLLS OUT and DOESN’T BREAK They all witness
this

SAM
As soon as I tell them it’s all

The robbery The fact that my
boyfriend of ten years would rather
be a fugitive than marry me

COWBOY
Sam what’s real is that you
deserve someone who worships the
ground you walk on and I’m sure
your father would agree

Bette takes a good look at Cowboy It is obvious he worships

the ground she walks on

BITTER BETTE
I know your mother would

Sam is surprised to find Bitter Bette agreeing with Cowboy

Sam digs in her toiletry bag pulls out a bottle of aspirin
and tries to open it

SAM

Both Cowboy and Trixie’s countenances instantly change

Trixie crosses off to the bathroom as Cowboy gets up and
heads outside

LEO

Flustered by her own feelings Bitter Bette follows Cowboy as

WYATT
But the ring

Sam slides off her ring and hands it to him An unexpected
gesture

Wyatt sits with it for a minute then digs in her toiletry bag
and takes out a box of floss He pulls off a long strand and
proceeds to wrap it around the ring’s band

SAM
What’re you doing

Newly sized he puts the ring back in an empty ring box
WYATT
Just trying to fix something I

screwed up a long time ago

Wyatt gets down on one knee and offers her the ring box

WYATT
Samantha Lee Judd will you marry
me

SAM
Wyatt-- You’re kneeling on
asphalt Why’re you kneeling on
asphalt-- Don’t answer that I’m

unarmed you know that right--
And doesn’t that hurt

WYATT
I worship the ground you walk on
Sam and if it’s asphalt so be it

Sam can’t believe these words just came out of Wyatt’s mouth
She looks back at Cowboy He manages to muster up a smile
for her -- but only because she’s looking for one

WYATT (CONTD)
I havent always done the right
thing Partly because I was
scared Mostly because I was dumb
But I’m not that scared dumb guy
anymore What’d you say

(re asphalt)
It’s harder than it looks

Sam takes the ring and puts it on It’s a perfect fit

SAM
I thought you’d never ask

She and Wyatt embrace as Cowboy slips back into the casino

Trixie GAGS

SAM
Okay now you’re just being mean--

Trixie gags again Then THROWS UP in a plastic coin bucket
on the dresser Sam automatically reaches for her friends
hair pulling it from her face and the bucket

SAM (CONTD)

TRIXIE
(with head in bucket)

Then something in the mirror catches her eye She turns and
faces the window Her PERFECTLY CLEAR BLUE SKY has a TEENY

And I’m not handling myself well so
stop acting like I am
(MORE )

Cowboy

SAM (contd)
I am almost thirty-five years old
Do you know what happens after a
woman turns thirty five Nothin
nada zip zap life stops Hope
disappears Any expectations for a
husband family two-car garage Out
the window On-line dating and step-
children and endless syringes of
Botox shoved into my forehead are all
I have to look forward to now and you
know what Just not that interested
So why dont you do yourself and
everyone else a favor and get back in
your truck and go

A TRANS-AM ASSHOLE drives by HONKING his horn

TRANS-AM ASSHOLE
Move it jackwipe

COWBOY
That’s not a bad idea

Cowboy grabs Sam and throws her over his shoulder

SAM
Whatre you doing--

COWBOY
One hundred and thuh-ree

He shoves her into the front seat
INT TANKER TRUCK

Cowboys driving down the strip with Sam Theyre both
soaked

SAM
You shouldve hit me the first
time Save my family dove money

COWBOY
Sorry Swerve for squirrels
Always have always will

A beat Cowboy tosses her a hand towel from the back seat

COWBOY (CONT’D)
I have a theory

SAM
I don’t care

COWBOY
Everything happens or doesn’t
happen for a reason Like your
wedding for example It didn’t not
happen because Wyatt got away or
shot your foot or even slept with
your best friend

(off her look)

I ran into your waitress It
didn’t happen cause it wasn’t
supposed to happen And all those
things they were just there as a

back up

SAM
This is supposed to make me feel
better

COWBOY

No but you know what will
INT TAXI - SAME TIME

Wyatt and Trixie are in a taxi The tension is thick and
steamy So steamy the windows are beginning to fog up

WYATT
You were gonna take care of it

TRIXIE
You were gonna tell Sam

WYATT
Well she knows now doesn’t she

EXT BRIDGE

Over the Las Vegas Strip The TANKER is pulled off to the
side Cowboy and Sam stand next to the rail The rain has
just stopped Sam takes off her promise ring and looks at it

COWBOY
That one’s the wrong size too

SAM
Amazing huh You know I thought
if I did everything right with
Wyatt and was patient and loving
and flossed he’d marry me And he
didn’t And then I thought if I
just helped him get to the next
step help him take that leap of
faith that’s so hard for men his
age to take he’d marry me

(MORE )

SAM (contd)
And he ran away My last hope was
that he’d realize how much I loved
him and he’d come back and he’d
Marry me And he did Do you know
I never once thought am I supposed
to marry him

COWBOY
That’s all part of my theory

Another sweet but subtle bonding moment

SAM
On the count of three

SAMCOWBOY
One Two Three

With everything she has she throws it into oncoming traffic
THE RING TRAVELS SOME SERIOUS DISTANCE

Sam smiles with satisfaction

INT TAXI - SAME TIME

The windows are now completely fogged Wyatt and Trixie both
sit with their arms crossed

WYATT TRIXIE
I loved her I loved her
WYATT (CONT’D) TRIXIE (CONTD)
Sure you did Obviously

Wyatt rolls down his window so he can see out of it just as
SAMS PROMISE RING bounces off the truck next to them FLIES
IN HIS WINDOW and pelts him in the face

WYATT
OW

INT TANKER TRUCK
Sam and Cowboy drive away

SAM
There’s something you should know
My Christmas lights It actually
takes me twice as long to take them
down as it does to put them up and
I may be rounding down

COWBOY
You don’t think I knew that

He smiles She smiles back

COWBOY (CONTD)
What’d you say I give you a ride
home

SAM
You know that’d be great Well
it would be if I still had one

COWBOY
Buckle up We’ve got plenty of gas
til we find you a new one

SAM (VO)
So there I was thirty-four and a
half years old starting over and I
was handling it much better than I
thought I would I guess I just knew
everything was going to be okay
A little crack of BLUE SKY peeps out of the dark clouds

SAM (VO)
All the signs were there

A sign YOURE LEAVING LAS VEGAS
SAM (VO)
And I was finally on the right
road
CUT TO

SUBTITLE ONE YEAR LATER
EXT A SMALL TEXAS TOWN - EARLY MORNING
The same depressing small town The morning sun is back
SAM (VO)
Or at the very least not ona
really wrong one
A SQUIRREL scurries across a telephone line down a

pole over a DONT MESS WITH TEXASS sticker into an
apartment complex parking lot

EXT SHERWOOD FOREST APARTMENT COMPLEX

--and under a BLACK EXTENDED CAB PICK UP TRUCK that faces
out of its parking spot Its filthy As evident by the

dirt graffiti “LYING ASSHOLE The drivers side mirror
still hangs by a metal thread

and in the back window an EMPTY GUN RACK

INT BATHROOM

A box of AMMUNITION

SAM (VO)
Like some people I used to know

A pair of female hands with a not-so-perfect MANICURE
clumsily load bullets into a SHOTGUN Sam’s PROMISE RING is
on the middle finger of the left hand

INT BEDROOM

A clock radio -- the numbers flip from 559 to 600
COUNTRY MUSIC fills the room

An OFF-SCREEN SHOTGUN is cocked

A hand finds its way to the snooze button and hits it The
MUSIC turns off It returns to its owner and lifts his eye
mask It’s Wyatt again With another

BARREL OF A SHOTGUN in his face

TRIXIE (0S)
Mornin’ baby

Trixie stands above him with his shotgun aimed at him in one
arm and their FIVE-MONTH-OLD BABY in the other

WYATT
Ill get my shoes

FADE OUT

THE END
