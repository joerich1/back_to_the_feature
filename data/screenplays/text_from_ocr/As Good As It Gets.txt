FADE IN
INT APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) HALLWAY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON apartment doorway As it opens and an

enormously SWEET-FACED ELDER WOMAN steps out bungled up
against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the
unseen love of her long life

SWEET-FACED WOMAN

Im just going to get some
flowers dear Ill be back in
twenty minutes Its tulip season
today Im so happy

And now she turns and faces the hallway her sweetness
dissolves in a flash replaced by repulsion and that
quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her
apartment closing the door as we consider her vacated

POV - MELVIN UDALL

in the hallway Well past 50 unliked unloved
unsettling A huge pain in the ass to everyone hes ever
met Right now all his considerable talent and strength
is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the
elevator door he holds open

MELVIN
Come here sweetheart come on

ON DOG

Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting
Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the
mutt who has ignores him

MELVIN
Wanna go for a ride Okay
sweetie

The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges
and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog
urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two The DOG
sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK

MELVIN

(a malevolent tone)
Youve pissed your last floor
dog-eared monkey

you

The dog takes a snap at Melvin but the man is much
meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout
shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the
garbage chute

MELVIN

Ill bet you wish you
sort of real dog now

were some
huh Dont

worry this is New York
can make it here you
anywhere

smelly fuck

And with that he stuffs him in the
lets go We hear a FADING SERIES of
from the DOG fade to nothingness
door opens emitting the loud sounds
NYE early 30s Simon has been born
Gothic horror and its strange that

If you

can make it
you know You ugly

garbage chute and
PLEADING ANOOOOS
as another apartment
of a PARTY and SIMON
and raised with

what that stew of

trauma has produced is a gifted decent man

INT APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK)

Frantic
to enter his apartment

SIMON
Verdell Here

He notices Melvin at the far end of

SIMON
Mr Udall
there

excuse me Hey

(as Melvin turns)
Have you seen Verdell

MELVIN
Whats he look like

he bolts into the hall

HALLWAY - NIGHT

Melvin is just about

good doggie

the hall

Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is

directly opposite Simons

SIMON
My dog you know I mean my
little dog with the adorable
face Dont you know what my dog
looks like

MELVIN
I got it Youre talking about
your dog I thought that was the
name of the colored man Ive been
seeing in the hall

Simon looks 0S -- and sees his black friend

SIMON
Which color was that

MELVIN
Like thick molasses with one of
those wide noses perfect for
smelling trouble and prison
food

Simon has had it

SIMON
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall

MELVIN
(not missing a beat)
Howre you doing

SIMON
Franks shows my work Mr Udall I
think you know that

FRANK
(overlapping)
Simon youve got to get dressed

MELVIN
(to Simon)
What I know is that as long as you
keep your work zipped up around
me I dont give a fuck what or
where you shove your show Are we
being neighbors for now

SIMON
(to Frank)
Do you still think I was
exaggerating

FRANK can only smile
FRANK

Definitely a package you dont
want to open or touch
MELVIN
Hope you find him I love that
dog

Simon terminally non-confrontational still finds
himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin

SIMON
(directly)
You dont love anything Mr
Udall

Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the
hallway

MELVIN
I love throwing your dog down the
garbage chute

INT MELVINS APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door counting to
five with each lock He turns the lights quickly on and
off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards
his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens
the medicine chest

INT MEDICINE CHEST

Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps He unwraps
one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the
process two more times

INT SIMONS APARTMENT ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN
holding Verdell who looks and finds

SIMON

who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves
quickly toward the group and his dog

SIMON
Thank the good Lord wow my
honey where have you been
PARTY GOER
(thinking the greetings
for him)

He always liked me

As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the
Handyman JACKIE Franks junior partner barking a
laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love As
the others greet Simon Jackie directs the group inside
Jackie lingers looking on affectionately as Simon picks
some awful sticky gunk from the dogs body he puts
Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS
in protest

SIMON
Just for a second okay

The DOG YAPS no Simon delighted picks him up again

SIMON
(kissing him on the mouth)
Look at him where was little
baby
HANDYMAN
(smiling)

In the basement garbage bin eating
diaper shit

Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman tongue in
cheek trying to suppress his amusement

SIMON
Go ahead John you earned your fun
(looking at Verdell)
How did he get down in the
basement I mean even if he got
on the elevator how

HANDYMAN
Maybe some nice neighbor shoved
him down the garbage chute

SIMON
My God No

He stares out Frank frustrated following
INT MELVINS APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT

Quiet -- safe -- just Melvins voice reading aloud as he
writes

MELVIN
â€˜Somewhat in the dark she had
confessed and he had forgiven
This is what you live for he
said Two heads on a pillow where
there is only the safety of being
with each other How she
wondered could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her

He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads

SIMON (0S)
Mr Udall
But Melvins into it His fingers flying as he reads
MELVIN
At last she was able to define
love Love was

More KNOCKING

SIMON (0S)
Mr Udall Id like to talk to you

please
MELVIN
Love was
He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of
love -- but the knocking throws him
MELVIN

Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
stool-pusher

He burst from his chair
INT APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT

As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step
back Melvin throws open the door He looks demonic

MELVIN
(loud and angry)
Yeeeess

SIMON
Maybe this can wait

Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door

SIMON
I found Verdell Mr Udall

MELVIN
Well thats a load off

Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to
close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery

SIMON

Did you do something to him
MELVIN

Do you realize that I work at

him

SIMON
(eyes downcast)
No I didnt

MELVIN
Do you like to be interrupt when
you are danging around in your
little garden

SIMON
No actually I even shut the
phone off and put a little piece
of cardboard in the ringer so no
one can just buzz me from d

MELVIN
Well I work all the time So
never never again interrupt me
Okay I mean never Not 30
years from now not if theres
fire Not even if you hear a thud
from inside my home and a week
later theres a smell from in
there that can only come from a
decaying body and you have to hold
a hanky against your face because
the stench is so thick you think
youre going to faint even then
dont come knocking or if its
election night and youre excited
and want to celebrate because some
fudge-packer you dated has been
elected the first queer President
of the United States and hes
going to put you up in Camp David
and you just want to share the
moment with someone dont knock
not on this door Not for
anything Got me Sweetheart

SIMON
Yes Its not a subtle point
youre making

MELVIN
Okay then

Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut

SIMON
So the theory of confrontations is
that now hell think twice before
messing with me

Frank smiles affectionately Simon turns serious

SIMON
Hes genuinely upsetting isnt
he

FRANK
Wont worry about it You go
ahead

Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly
on Melvins door There is a sharp change in his demeanor

MELVIN (0S)
Oh Im pissed Now I am really
pissed

Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open
Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him
forward Melvin is scared Operating on survival mode

MELVIN
No touch No touch No touch

FRANK
You may think you can intimidate
the whole world with your
attitude but I grew up in Hell
My grandmother had more attitude
You dont intimidate me

MELVIN
(calling)
Police Police Fucking crooked
police doughnut-munching morons
help me
(to Frank)
Assault and battery and youre
black
FRANK

Shhhh now I like Simon I like
him enough to batter you
unrecognizable if you verbally
abuse him or so much as touch his
dog again Meanwhile Ill try
and think how you can make this up
to him

(suddenly loud)
I hate doing this Im an art
dealer

(beat)
Have a nice day Party

He tosses Melvin back and walks out Melvin straightens
his shirt as he steps out into the hall Frank smiles as
he re-enters the other apartment Melvin appears
impressed

EXT NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROLS RESTAURANT - DAY
A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin His
walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the
danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear
At times he places his palms together and extends his
arms cutting a path through people We will be very
pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks

CLOSER ON MELVIN

His eyes focused on the terrain
INT CAROLS RESTAURANT - DAY
ANGLE ON WAITRESS

CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer
You would not guess it but her working hours tend to be
the most carefree time of the day She is telling a
story about her son for the umpteenth time

CAROL
(to the Mothers
little girl)
Look at you youre all better

MOTHER
Its that new medication

CAROL
You know all my sons stuff
right

The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does but
Carol interrupts her

CAROL
No no no I got a date tonight
Im walking out the door this
morning and he says to me Mom
I promise not to get one of my
fevers or coughs during your
date

MOTHER
Isnt that sweet

CAROL
Little blonde angle
(to child
affectionately)
Eat everything

Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a
table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find
a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table

WOMAN
It just came out of me I said
you love me the way a remote
control loves a TV As long as I
switch every time

HER MALE COMPANION
Wonderful

MELVIN
People who talk in metaphors can
shampoo my crotch
(on their look)
Eat up

They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the
waitress station where two waitresses LISA and CAROL
are talking

LISA
Pay me back next week

CAROL
I owe you I told you today
thems the rules Oh excuse me
Melvin

She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out
of the way He gulps at the contact (since no one else
ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness

MELVIN
Im starving

CAROL
(firmly to Lisa)
Will you please take it

Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path with
stealth so that she must touch him again to get him out
of the way

LISA
This way you take a cab home so
you have time to get ready for the
date

CAROL
Ready is not my problem

She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh If we could
read Melvin which we cant wed see him unsettled by the
date talk To Carol he is as harmless as furniture

CAROL
(to Melvin)
Go sit down You know youre not
allowed back here Spencers
more excited about it than I am
He says Mom I promise not to
get a fever or couch during your date

The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go
awww

CAROL
I know Hes just the best

MELVIN
Ive got Jews at my table

CAROL
Its not your table Its the
places table Behave This
once you can sit at someone
elses station

The two waitresses signal their protests

CAROL
Or you can just wait your turn

Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper he hangs
near their table his discomfort builds in this limbo
then

MELVIN

How much more you got to eat
Your appetite isnt as big as
your noses is it

WOMAN
What
MAN
(to Woman)
Lets go --

The Woman starts to protest

MAN
Lets leave Were going

Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his
pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed
As he opens his utensils

CAROL
Bryan says he doesnt care how
long youve been coming you ever
act like this again youre barred
for life Im gonna miss the
excitement but Ill handle it

There is in Carols attitude toward Melvin some
ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only
one in the place who can handle him She starts to clear
the table

MELVIN
The tables fine if it had some
cholesterol on it Two sausages
six bacon strips fries three
eggs over easy and coffee

CAROL
Youre gonna die soon with that
diet you know that

MELVIN
Were all gonna die soon I will
You will It sure sounds like
your son will

ON CAROL

Stunned Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her
perfect guard and momentarily devastated her Melvin
senses that hes gone way too far He wipes his knife

CAROL

If you ever mention my son again
you will never be able to eat here
again Do you understand Give me
some sign you understand or leave
now Do you understand me

(adds truthful label)
you crazy freak Do you

A beat and then Melvin nods hardly breathing -- backing
down

CAROL
Okay Ill get your order

a

e walks away Melvin watches her biting his lower
ip He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself

hb

INT CAROLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is underneath a YOUNGER cuter MAN on the living room
sofa He is expertly into foreplay She begins to make
noises as she responds each time startling herself
with her own noise and trying to reign it in

Shes two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway
-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the
emergence of this sexy self that she laughs The Young
Man stops and looks at her

YOUNG MAN
What
CAROL
I I I dont know You got
me

His eyes try to burn into hers She is getting excited
but doesnt know how to play it He pushes one of the
fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her
mouth She closes her teeth his fingers attempt
opening her mouth She stops him

CAROL
Let me just do whatever I do by
myself Ill catch up to you

someplace I promise

(as hes put off)
Oh no dont look like that
No Im sorry if Im a goof

And so with earnestness and caring she has transformed
the sex into something more intimate -- and talk about
egg in your beer hotter Things are getting wild when
we hear from the distance a child SPENCER CALLING and
COUGHING

CAROL
Kissing kissing boys Oh my
Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencers call continues

SPENCER (0S)
(softly)
Grandma grandma

YOUNG MAN
Maybe you better check

CAROL
Like what did you think I was
going to do

INT HALLWAYBEVERLYS ROOM - NIGHT

Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway
she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her
mother BEVERLY is listening to music on headphones
she takes them off when she sees Carol then hears the
cough

BEVERLY
Im sorry I was hearing just
everything you were doing so I put
these on to give you privacy

Carol now goes into her sons room

INT SPENCERS ROOM - NIGHT
The room is a monument to horrible sleepless nights
two drugstore de-humidifying filters a nebulizer
(breathing contraption) a waste basket a night stand
filled with medicine a blood pressure kit along with
some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged
into the tiny space

SPENCER
Im sorry

CAROL
Dont be silly How bad

SPENCER
Not bad
Carol feels his head thats okay Then he coughs --
trying to suppress it then a bigger cough they each
know what that signals She brings up a waste basket as
he throws up she comforts him He apologizes She

loves him
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As she re-enters He is taking a cigarette from a pack

CAROL
(a bit panicked)
You cant smoke He cant take
smoke
He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand
squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his

hand She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he
picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking
at her with extreme distaste She barks a laugh to
cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth

CAROL
Oh God I dont even notice
anymore

She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel Tries to make
light

CAROL
Thatll teach you

YOUNG MAN
Dont apologize

CAROL
(perturbed)
That wasnt an apology

She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her --
how uncomfortable he is

CAROL
Hey this is just a little throw-
up -- its nothing to be so

embarrassed about Really
(as he shifts
uncomfortably)
Thanks for the dinner Let me
write down which trains you take
to get back

YOUNG MAN
No way

She brightens

YOUNG MAN
Ill take a cab

She deflates as he moves past her

YOUNG MAN
Too much reality for a Friday
night

EXT HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT

A cold night in hell Three young men bullshit near the
approach to the tunnel Their names are VINCENT EVAN
and DOUG who is the oldest at 28 Vincent is dopey and
the most likeable of the gritty little trio

EVAN
Why is every customer surprised I
read books

DOUG
(amazed)
You read books

EVAN
Oh wow I know this guy Look
He even bought me dinner

They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in
front of them CARL checks them out carefully through
the front window He is talking on the speaker phone

CARL
(slightly exasperated)
Look I just cant I promised
Simon Id find him a model

FRIEND (VO)
(on speaker phone
flirting)
Carl take me off the speaker
Did I tell you that these are
house seats Cmon you could use
a break Hello Carl are you
there hello

Seeing the hustlers

CARL
I just found a model

DOUG
(to Carl)
Hey how its goin

EVAN
Hey hi remember

CARL
I only need one

EVAN
You picked me up maybe a few
weeks I dont know some time
ago You were very flattering

about our encounter
CARL
Maybe just you and me but this

is for a painting I need a
pretty face

Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him trying to conceal
his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest

INT SIMONS APARTMENT - DAY

There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer
He is more relaxed than weve seen him -- a man at peace
humming to his favorite music talking to his dog who
scratches at the door Simon opens the door to Vincent

SIMON
Sorry I was out in the studio
doing some work and I forgot about
our appointment

He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away
-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him
and eyeing the expensive apartment

SIMON
I usually make such a big deal out
of picking models but Carls so
thorough Ill bet he drove you
nuts checking your references
And he turns and sees the naked model

SIMON
(taken aback)
This isnt a nude

Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes

VINCENT
Just kidding around
(then mutters)
So much for love

INT SIMONS APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)

Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the
increasingly uneasy Simon

SIMON
Exactly what is your previous
experience

VINCENT

How about that pose
(sing-song)

This is not fun
(then)

Give me some direction

Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive

tries not to show it

SIMON
Nothing I just watch till
something strikes me Do anything
you think of -- try different
thing Until I say hold that
pose Then just try and
comfortably hold it

VINCENT
(trying another space)
The fact that you havent said
hold it means I havent done it
right is that correct I
havent done it right

SIMON
No Okay What I do is watch
and wait for um You ever watch
someone who doesnt know youre
watching an old woman on a bus
kids going to school and you see
this flash come over them and you
know immediately that it has
nothing to do with anything
external -- that its in respond

He
to a private thought they just
had They are just sort of realer
and more alive And when you
notice it so are you If you look
at someone long enough you
discover their humanity

Vincents slack-jawed expression changes He feels an
intellectual tingle to be having this conversation

VINCENT
I know exactly what you mean

Theres a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity
SIMON
Hold it
Vincent does so -- hums a bit of Satisfaction to
celebrate

INT RESTAURANT - DAY

Carol and LESLIE another waitress are waiting for their
order at the cappuccino bar Leslie is telling the story
of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life
Carol is rapt

As they pass Melvin she does not break stride nor give
him notice Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so
-- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment
commentary on her every action

MELVIN
Clippity clop -- clippity clop --
she has to pretend she doesnt
hear me Listening to the story
from the upset friend now she
drops off the cappuccino and
smiles at the putzette who doesnt
even say Thank you No the
putzette wanted the whipped cream
so back she goes and now she has
to pass him again and its getting
tougher to make believe

CAROL
(reluctant forgiveness)
Okay
Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an

uncharacteristic rabbit punch

CAROL
Whats with the plastic picnic
ware Why not try ours afraid

it isnt clean
MELVIN
I see the help -- judgement call

CAROL
Just give yourself a little pep
talk Must try other peoples
clean silverware as part of the
fun of dining out

MELVIN
Whats wrong with your son
anyway

CAROL

What do you care
Melvin just looks at her

CAROL
Hes gotta fight to breathe
His asthma can just shoot off the
charts -- hes allergic to dust
and this is New York and his
immune system bails on him when
theres trouble so an ear
infection Is this bothering
you

MELVIN
(caught)
No

CAROL
An ear infection can send us to
the emergency room -- maybe five
six times a month where I get
whatever nine-year-old they just
made a doctor Nice chatting with

you

MELVIN
His name

CAROL
Spencer

MELVIN
Okay

CAROL

(quietly)

Spence

She exits

INT SIMONS APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)
The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary as Simon puts
the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent A beat
and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and
the scene -- gone before we can examine him further

SIMON
You can put on anything you want
now I might be sort of done
here

Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his
immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every
second of silence during the transition then LOUD
MUSIC PLAYS Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME Simon
does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down --
which Vincent does

ANGLE - APARTMENT

where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress --
Vincents two friends from the street sweeping all
objects into large sacks -- one of them Doug pauses
to look past the terrace to the studio

DOUG
Lucky Vinnie -- hes a painting

INT SIMONS APARTMENT STUDIO - DAY

MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff
VINCENT
So youre practically finished
huh
SIMON
Yes well theres one more
stage -- trying to figure out if

its any good

Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another
perspective he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod
of self-approval -- hes finished Vincent is desperate
to distract

CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens stretches and pricks his
ears He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to
frantically scratch attracting Simons attention

As Simon keeps walking Vincent shoots over to the
canvas
VINCENT
Wait -- I want to see the

painting
SIMON
Just a second -- he has to go

VINCENT
Please NO

Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a
bullet Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown
to see his humanity captured -- to be immortalized

INT SIMONS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL
stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK

Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he
continues to walk toward Doug and Evan not noticing
them -- Vincent terribly afraid appears behind Simon

SIMON
(to Vincent)
Whats the matter sweetheart

He instantly stops Shocked Frozen His eyes on the
stranger Doug looking at him Now Vincent comes in
Doug greets him

DOUG
Yo

Simon turns to Vincent

SIMON
Why are you doing this

VINCENT
No No No Hey that painting
in there I just want to tell

you
Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack
EVAN
(to Vincent)

What are you doing Cruising him

And he uses the hat rack first as a spear then as a
club as the brief savage attack begins

ON VERDELL
as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in
fear The three attackers leave Now silence A single

BARK from VERDELL

INT APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK
A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is
whisked down to the elevator Its impossible to tell if
Simon is awake or dead Melvin is standing against the
wall near his door a cop RAY interviewing him

RAY
Okay So you call 911 and dont
leave your name -- even a dumb
geezer should know that emergency
automatically pulls up your name
How come you make a mistake like

that

MELVIN
How come youre pretending to do
cop work -- â€˜cause I dont think

you could find your ass if you
were spotted the hole

RAY
(stunned)
What
MELVIN
Just move on No one here killed
him
RAY

Oh is he dead

MELVIN
Ask him

RAY
We will if we can and if we cant
well come back and ask you again
and again

INT APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY -
ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

Frank standing upset anxious holding a dog bowl a
leash and VERDELL who is more upset making pathetic
little CRYING SOUNDS

As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell Frank is talking to the
Sweet-Faced Woman

SWEET-FACED WOMAN
Ive been praying for him since I
heard

FRANK
So Ive got to get to the
hospital If you could take the
dog just for tonight
SWEET-FACED WOMAN
Oh Lord -- Ive got all these
antique knick-knacks Or else
Id be glad

FRANK
Maybe if you kept locked in
the bathroom No Okay Thanks
(as he turns away and she
closes the door he adds)
Old bitch Damn dog

A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed
and enjoyed Franks hostile mutterings

VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches
his mugger

FRANK
Youre taking him yes youre
taking him -- this will clear the
books One night You want to
say no to me Try because
Ive never felt as nuts as I do
right this second I almost want
you to try saying no

MELVIN
(quietly)
Im not saying nothing to you

FRANK
Thanks for looking after him

Frank pushes open the door to Melvins apartment and
places Verdell inside

INT MELVINS APARTMENT - NIGHT

MUSIC IN as Frank pulls the door partially closed to
block Verdells escape

The music represents Verdells state of mind -- trapped
in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him We
STAY with the dog during the 0S dialogue As his head
turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue
continues OS

MELVIN (0S)
Hey where are you going You
cant do this
(calls after Frank
I cant take a dog
(a confession)
Nobodys ever been in here before

FRANK (0S)
(threatening)
You dont want to mess with me
today Ill figure something else
out tomorrow

INT MELVINS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows Now
Melvin sees him

MELVIN
Youre dead

VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking
along the far wall Melvin finds Verdells fear of him a
bit calming

MELVIN
I dont have dog food And I
wont want dog food here Youll
eat what we have Youll eat what
we eat

Melvin exits Verdell is in a major funk
INT MELVINS APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped
meat sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the
room

MELVIN
Dont you touch anything

INT MELVINS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC
CONTINUES ominously Melvin sets the bowl down and
exits Verdell breathes excitedly though looking
alternately in all directions his recent past making
him suspect this feast is a trick He sniffs

cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a
dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE from 0S we hear the sound
of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then
MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns ignoring Verdell he
sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly Its odd
Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl
with his tail to Melvin Then Melvin begins to play and
sing Monty Pythons Always Look On The Bright Side Of
Life with its cheerful whistle refrain Verdell looks
over with surprise and pleasure But just as mood lifts
and warmth threatens Melvin stops abruptly turns out
the lights and exits

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

horror Swollen one savage discolored cut We are into

tears sobs actually
SIMON

They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in
the doorway

FRANK

Hey hey

Haaa bad but temporary The
nurses say its much better than

SIMON

No

She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse --
then thinks better of it

JACKIE
Wait I have a smaller one

But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror --
he starts to look -- then thinks better of it

SIMON

SIMON
You are very certain my dog is
okay because you have no

Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery
then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive
underwater First a small mumbled pep talk to himself

SIMON
Okay waiting gives the devil
time Now
He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror
he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him

awed by his misfortune

SIMON
Oh my Whered I go Ummmm

As Simon works to stop crying

discomfort

Well

that might cheer you up

SIMON

Get out

MELVIN

Dont piss on a gift tough guy
You want to know why the dog

prefers me

Its a trick

Melvin is weird with

its not affection

Simon looks up his mood turning on a dime -- hes
rapt Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair
MELVIN

I carry bacon in my pocket

SIMON
(pleased)
Oh my gosh
MELVIN

(hands him bacon)

Now well both call him

SIMON

Come on sweetheart

MELVIN

Yo yO yo

Verdell goes

like a bullet to Melvin

who is totally

surprised and staggered by the implications True love

and such

SIMON

Would you leave now please

MELVIN
Stupid dog
(to Simon)
I dont get it

He exits looking apologetically at Simon in stoic
ruin

INT CAROLS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Carol in bed on the pullout sofa She is in turmoil
there is THUNDER but no rain She walks to the kitchen
She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits

INT BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol
shares a closet with her mother who is now asleep

Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet leaving
her nightgown on the floor There is something sexy
here the woman in Carol churning She plops on a summer
dress -- no time for underwear

ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMONS APARTMENT HOUSE

As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on
it

As she enters building and realizes its not just that
shes wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet
T-shirt contest the fabric clinging to her breasts
like the old movie poster of The Deep

INT NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

As Carol passes Simons door stands in front of
Melvins apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness
and knocks on the door then RINGS the BELL Finally
Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side
of the door

CAROL
Uh Udall

MELVIN (0S)
Carol the waitress

CAROL
Yes

As we hear him unlock the door Carol looks at her
breasts and gasps She grasps the fabric and holds it
straight out just as Melvin opens the door His hair is
static city standing on end as he periodically gives it
self-conscious pats

CAROL
The doctors had your billing
address Im sorry about the
hour

MELVIN
I was working cant you just
drop me a thank-you note

CAROL
Thats not why Im here
(tearing suddenly)
though you have no idea what
its like to have a real
conversation with a doctor about
Spencer

MELVIN
(very uncomfortable)
Note Put it in the note

CAROL
Why did yo do this for me

MELVIN
To get you back at work so you can
wait on me

CAROL
But you do have some idea how
strange that sounds Im
worried that you did this
because

She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long
silence Finally

MELVIN
You waiting for me to say
something
(as she shakes her head)
What sort of thing do you want
Look Ill be at the restaurant
tomorrow

CAROL
I dont think I can wait until
tomorrow This needs clearing up

MELVIN
What needs clearing up

CAROL
(strong and true)
Im not going to sleep with you
I will never ever sleep with you
Never Not ever

Melvins reaction Well hell never get credit for the

brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to
scream --
-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt
during his half turn away from her -- and then answer
hoarsely

MELVIN

Im sorry We dont open for the
no-sex oaths until 9 am

Carol is amused surprised maybe in some small way
ever taken by his style but top priority is clarity

CAROL
Im not kidding

MELVIN
Okay Anything else

CAROL
Just how grateful I am

Her mission completed -- she turns

MELVIN
So youll be at work

CAROL
Yes

INT MELVINS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Its a 322 am as the two digital clocks on Melvins
night stand tell us He gets up -- the first time weve
seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor
twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his
body angles from the bed in a deliberate way
He is having anxiety He sits at the piano and plays

very briefly Stops -- wipes some sweat from his
forehead Walks to his computer room -- turns the light
on and then quickly off Walks to his refrigerator

MELVIN

life Okay if I sit here

SIMON

Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him

MELVIN
I havent been sleeping I
havent been clear or felt like
myself Im in trouble Some son
of a bitch is burning my bridges

behind my back But the
tiredness -- boy Not just
sleepy

SIMON
But sick -- nauseous -- where

everything looks distorted and
everything inside just aches --
when you can barely get up the
will to complain

MELVIN
(brightening)
Yeah
He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to
take it from here

MELVIN
Im glad we did this

He rises and makes an awkward exit

MELVIN
Good talking to you

He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned

INT CAROLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Carol seated working on a letter She is trying to
express her gratitude An enormous sheaf of completed
pages sit next to her She is so involved she doesnt

even look up as a young man SEAN knocks on the door and
is let in by Beverly

They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly
hear Spencer greeting him We MOVE IN and read over
Carols shoulder -- Im sorry to have gotten sloppy and
emotional in this letter but it would have been on my
conscionce (sic) forever if I didnt tell you how
gratefull (sic)

BEVERLY
Youre not still writing that
thank-you note

CAROL
Im on the last page How do you
spell conscience

BEVERLY
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e I got Sean
from the bakery to baby-sit so
lets go out

CAROL

I still dont feel safe leaving
Spencer with someone How do you
spell it again

BEVERLY

Spencer is okay Youd better
start finding something else to do
with your free time If you cant
feel good about this break and
step out a little

(struts and pumps

her arms)
You ought to get Mr Udall to send
you over a psychiatrist
CAROL

(more emotionally

than she intended)
I dont need one cause I know
whats really going on here I
have to finish this letter or
Ill go nuts

(looking at paper

weepy)
This cant be right -- con-
science
Carol breathes heavily -- gets control stopping herself

on the brink of crying

BEVERLY
Carol What
Carol is amazed at herself that she might not be able
to stem the flow wide-eyed with apprehension she

looks at her mother who in return only nods permission
for Carol to let it go A last defiant snort from Carol
-- and then she is overwhelmed The headline comes first

CAROL
I dont know Its very strange
not feeling that stupid panic
thing inside you all the time
Without that you just start
thinking about yourself -- and
what does that ever get anybody
Today on the bus there was this
adorable couple and I felt myself
giving them a dirty look -- I had
no idea everything was

BEVERLY
Go ahead

CAROL

(great forceful

hand gestures)
Â» moving in the wrong
direction Away from when I
even remembered what it was like
to have a man to anything
hold fucking -- sorry -- hands
with for Christs sake I was
feeling like really bad that Dr
Bettes is married

(this next ones

tough)
Which is probably why I make poor
Spencer hug me more than he wants
to Like the poor kid doesnt
have enough problems He has to
make up for his mom not getting

any
(weeps at her
insight)
Oh boy Who needs these
thoughts

BEVERLY
Spencers doing fine So what are
you saying that youre frustr

CAROL
Leave me be Why are you doing
this Why are you picking at my
sores What is it that you
want You want what Whats
with you I hope getting me
thinking of everything thats
wrong when all I want is to not
do this has some purpose
(puffy red
furious)
What is it Mom No kidding

Slumped fought out -- Carol gets out one last
husky voiced question

CAROL
What is it you want What

confused and messed with -- she tosses the note

CAROL

(a breath then)
What you did changed my life

She offers him the note
MELVIN
No no thank you notes

CAROL
Well part of what I said in this
entire history of my life which
you wont read is that somehow
youve done more for my mother my
son and me than anyone else ever
has And that makes you the most
important surprising generous
person Ive ever met and that you
be in our daily prayers forever

MELVIN
Lovely

CAROL
I also wrote one part I wrote
Im sorry I was talking about I

was sorry when I got mad at you
when you came over and you told my
son that he ought to answer back
so I wrote that

(reading from the

letter Melvin

wildly uncomfortable)
I was sorry for busting you on

that and Im sorry for busting
in on you that night when I
said I was never I was sorry

and Im sorry every time your food
was cold and that you had to wait
two seconds for a coffee filler

Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into
emotionally moved by her own words

CAROL
Â» and Im sorry for never
spotting right there at the table
in the restaurant the human being
that had it in him to do this
thing for us You know what Im
just going to start from the
beginning I have not been able
to express my gratefulness to
you even as I look at the word
grateful now it doesnt begin to
tell you what I feel for you

And finally Carol notes Melvins mood and pauses

MELVIN
Nice of you thank you
CAROL
Thank you

MELVIN
Now I want you to do something for me

She looks at him for a very strange long beat

CAROL
Oh Im sorry Didnt I say

another check The PHONE RINGS This is an amazing
development He has almost no recent experience with
receiving a nighttime phone call He makes a little
comment to himself as he moves

MELVIN
Woo-woo

He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is
-- and then remembering crosses and picks it up but
before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his
throat

ON CAROL

As she hears his throat being cleared It is not a
pretty sound (The following conversation is INTERCUT)

CAROL

CAROL

CAROL

to you
SIMON

SIMON
Thats very thoughtful

MELVIN
Never a break Never
Carol steps into the back Melvin disappointed that hes
not sitting next to Carol Carol is wedged in the small
back seat She struggles to get her feet in

MELVIN
Youre really jammed back there

He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his
seat and with some effort wrenches it forward giving
Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel
She is startled by the gesture

CAROL
Thanks Melvin

MELVIN
Welcome

And off they go Simon and Carol stunned by the manners
EXT 12TH STREET
Turning onto Fifth

MELVIN
I got the whole ride programmed

CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all
carefully labelled He selects and begins to play the
one marked ICEBREAKER It is a song which we clearly
and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick
burst of YMCA Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles

MELVIN
Just wanted to see what youd do

No we have greatness here

He goes for another CD labelled FOR USE TO REP THINGS
UP

The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY
SELECTED MUSIC

MELVIN

Doesnt matter Shes enjoying
herself Consider it part of the

EXT ROAD - DAY
A short time later Carol is now driving

CAROL
Im sure Simon they did
something real off for you to feel
this way But when it comes to
your partners -- or your kid --
things will always be off for you
unless you set it straight Maybe
this thing happened to you just to
give you that chance

MELVIN
Nonsense

CAROL
Anybody here whos interested in
what Melvin has to say raise their
hands

Simon does not raise his hand Simon and Carol have thus
declared their majority

SIMON
Do you want to know what happened
with my parents

CAROL
Yes I really would

SIMON
Well

CAROL
No let me pull over so I can pay
full attention

Car pulling over toward parking spot

EXT HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY
She takes the car curbside and parks

CAROL
Now go ahead

Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol He looks
innocent Several beats -- Melvin almost says something
-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him Finally

SIMON
Well I always painted Always
And my mother always encouraged
it She was sort of fabulous

about it actually and she used
to I was too young to think
there was anything at all wrong
with it and she was very
natural She used to pose nude

for me and I thought or assumed

my father was aware of it

MELVIN
This stuff is pointless

CAROL
Hey -- you let him

MELVIN
You like sad stories -- you want
mine

CARL

Go ahead Simon Really
Please Dont let him stop you Ignore him

SIMON
Okay Well one day my father
came in on one of those painting

sessions when I was nine -- and he
just started screaming at her --
at us -- at evil And

MELVIN

(very quickly)
my father didnt leave his
room for 11 years -- he hit my
hand with a yardstick if I made a
mistake on the piano

CAROL
Go ahead Simon Your father
walked in on you and was yelling
and really come on

SIMON
I was trying to defend my mother
and make peace in the lamest way
I said shes not naked -- its
art And then he started hitting
me And he beat me unconscious
After that he talked to me less
and less -- he knew before I left
for college my dad came into my
room He held out his hand It
was filled with money A big wad
of sweaty money

(gathers himself)
And he said to me I dont want
you to ever come back I grabbed
him and I hugged him He turns
and walked out

Carol whose life has been rugged but basic feels as
strange as she does moved by Simons trauma which is so
much more complicated than her meat and potatoes
troubles She looks out her window -- then kisses her
fingers and touches them to Simons cheek A nice
understated gesture of friendship

CAROL
Well you know -- I still stay
what I said Youve got to get
past it all when it comes to your
parents We all have these horror
stories to get over

Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME

MELVIN
Thats not true Some of us have
great stories pretty stories

that take place at lakes with
boats and friends and noodle
salad Just not anybody in this

car But lots of people -- thats
their story -- good times and
noodle salad and thats what

makes it hard Not that you had
it bad but being that pissed that
so many had it good

CAROL
No

MELVIN

INT FIRST RATE RESTAURANT

As he enters looks for and then spot Carol She is

having a martini at the bar Sitting on a stool --
watching COUPLES dance Happy by herself Turning
down a MAN who wants to buy her another And Melvin
watches Watches his date

HEAD WAITER
Shall I get her for you

MELVIN
No its all right Ill just
watch

He enjoys watching her for a few more beats She turns
-- Melvin makes a Haul your ass over here gesture
and she smiles and walks toward him A WAITER has
lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her
She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables
giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the bg
She notices the waiter in her trail

CAROL
(mouthing the words
to Melvin)
My drink is following me

Melvin watches her approach It is all too exquisite
He takes a breath -- it doesnt come easily

CAROL
You look s

She stops herself from saying sexy regathers then

CAROL
You look great

They arrives at the table He holds out her chair for her

CAROL
You wanna dance

MELVIN
Ive been thinking about that
since you brought it up before

CAROL
(rising)
And

MELVIN

No

(and before she can

digest that)
I dont get this place They
make me buy an outfit but they let
you wear a house dress I dont
get it

ON CAROL

Melvin has no idea he has insulted her Sandbagged in
extreme she gets up -- actually ready to leave

MELVIN
No Wait What Why I didnt
mean it You gotta sit down You
can still give me the dirty
look just sit down and give it
to me

CAROL
Melvin pay me a compliment I
need one and quick You have no
idea how much what you said just
hurt my feelings

MELVIN
(really pissed
mutters)
That monominute somebody gets that
you need them they threaten to go
away Never fails

CAROL
Thats not compliment Melvin
Thats just trying to sound smart
so I feel stupid A compliment
is something nice about somebody
else Now or never

MELVIN
Okay

He waves her down

CAROL
(sitting)
And mean it
MELVIN

Can we order first

She thinks and then nods The waiter is across the room
This does not stop Melvin

MELVIN
(calling)
Two crab dinners and pitcher of
cold beer
(to Carol)
Baked or fries

CAROL
Fries
MELVIN
(calling)
One baked -- one fries

STARTLED WAITER
(shouting back)
Ill tell your waiter

MELVIN
(to Carol)
Okay I got a real great
compliment for you and its true

CAROL
I am so afraid youre about to say
something awful

MELVIN

Dont be pessimistic Its not
your style Okay Here I
goes Clearly a mistake

(this is hell

for him)
I have this -- what Ailment
And my doctor -- a shrink who
I used to see all the time he
says 50 or 60 percent of the time
a pill can really help I hate
pills Very dangerous things
pills Hate I am using the
word hate about pills My
compliment is that when you came
to my house that time and told me
how youd never -- well you were
there you know The next
morning I started taking these
pills

CAROL
(a little confused)
I dont quite get how thats a
compliment for me

Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion --
so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly --
then

MELVIN
You make me want to be a better
man

Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so
slip under her guard She stumbles a bit -- flattered
momentarily moved and his for the taking

CAROL
Thats maybe the best compliment
of my life

MELVIN

Then Ive really overshot here
cause I was aiming at just enough
to keep you from walking out

Carol laughs

CAROL
So how are you doing with those
pills Well I hopahopahopa

MELVIN

Takes months to know They work
little by little

(holds his head

then)

Talking like this is exhausting

Carol moves to the chair next to him She sits very
close -- he tenses

CAROL
Have you ever let a romantic
moment make you do something you
know is stupid

MELVIN
Never

CAROL
Heres the trouble with never

TIGHT SHOT

for the kiss Their faces are close -- she looks at
him She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him
-- he is wide-eyed and afraid His face almost moves
away -- in a shot this close its almost flight But
now his head moves back and he receives her kiss It is
brief Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself
Melvin cant bear the pleasure

MELVIN
You dont owe me that

CAROL
That wasnt payment When you
first came into breakfast when I

saw you -- I thought you were
handsome Then of course you
spoke So now that your soft

lil underbelly is all exposed
Tell me why did you bring me

Melvins voice is soft -- hesitant okay vulnerable
as he holds up his hands in a stop signal

MELVIN
Well ah thats a personal
question

CAROL

Tell me even if youre scared
Tell me why you wanted me here
Its okay

She kisses him again

CAROL
If you ask me Ill say yes
MELVIN
(dissembling)
There are lots of reason I had

a thought that if you had sex with
Simon it might

CAROL
(humiliated)
Sex with Simon

MELVIN
Its one idea

CAROL
Thats why you brought me Look
at me Is that really why you
brought me Like Im a what and
I owe you what

MELVIN
I dont know why I brought you --
that idea occurred to me is all
It came out first Hey you kiss
him -- me He says he loves
you You two hit it off But you
dont want to fine Forget
what I said about sex with Simon
It was a mistake
CAROL
(wiping away tears)
Ill never forget you said it

MELVIN
It was a mistake

But she has already turned away and exits the
restaurant Melvin alone and miserable

SIMON
Hello Hello

Carol thrusts open the door and enters

SIMON
Was this supposed to be your room

CAROL

Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him
inadvertently venting some anger as she does so

SIMON
Can you not be violent

CAROL

with the pants

SIMON
(emphatically)
No

CAROL
Im going to take a big bath and

Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins
to prepare a bath

SIMON
(turning off the light)
Good night
CAROL
Good night

We are ON Simon settling in for sleep when instinct or
sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he
faces the bathroom and we have

SIMONS POV

Carol sitting at tubs edge -- a towel around her and now
as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair
-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast
exposed

BACK TO SCENE

SIMON
(a whisper)
Hold it

He leaves the bed
ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK

Whats he up to he takes the blotter from the desk set
and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair
and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of
the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol

SIMON
Ive got to sketch you

CAROL
No Absolutely not Im shyer
than you think I give the wrong
impression sometimes and

SIMON
I havent even been thinking about
sketching for weeks

CAROL
Stop staring Do a vase

SIMON
But youre beautiful your skin
glows

CAROL

Thanks But I just want to take a
bath and

SIMON
That long neck -- the line of
you youre porcelain your
back goes on forever Youre
classic youre why cavemen
chiseled on walls

CAROL
All right cut me a break

Simons pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him
earnestly engrossed a beat of indecision and then shyly
but deliberately she lowers the towel Hes right

Shes breathtaking

INT BAR - NIGHT

Melvin sits alone nursing a drink Hes been talking to
the bartender

MELVIN
So then the next thing I know
shes sitting right next to me
and then well its not right to

up I got nervous I said the
wrong thing and if I hadnt I
could be in bed now with a woman

pushing the last legal drug

He sits there just another Joe on a bar stool with his
heart breaking

FULL SHOT

Carol holding a pose for Simon He is holding a
ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter His
style cramped by his cast

SIMON
No No This is great this is
so great I cant get the angle
with this cast
He struggles with the cast and then decides to struggle
no more Summoning remarkable strength he rips a piece
from the cast freeing his hand -- he roars ironically --
a lions roar of liberation He is back at his center

INT HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Melvin is having a room service breakfast

The door opens Simon enters A new Simon -- better
than ever clearly happy -- a morning-after glow
MELVIN

Carol follows his out Her arms are filled with the
hotel soaps shampoos etc

MELVIN
Sorry didnt realize she was
right there
(a beat)
Did you have sex with her

CAROL
To hell with sex

Carol looks at Melvin -- he cant meet her gaze

No -- dont apologize -- it was
the luckiest thing for all of us
that you didnt answer last
night I cant hear you okay
dear just listen to me then

ON MELVIN AND CAROL

Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings
the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in
her suitcase

MELVIN
I get why youre angry Its no
snap to explain why I was like
that but lets not try to do it
on the run

SIMON

didnt come to see me when you
heard I was hurt but the
important thing I want you to know
is your son is happy Im working

note from wherever I land and then

He hangs up totally satisfied with himself and rips over
to Carol and Melvin

MELVIN
Now hes going to want to

ride to the lake or whatever So

SIMON
Another place where

MELVIN
Does it matter

Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a
special CD labelled For Emergency Use Only As it
PLAYS a confessional love SONGS
CAROL
I dont want to hear that music
right now

MELVIN
What do you mean You said you
liked it

CAROL
I dont

MELVIN

This one has a special meaning

CAROL
Its your car but I dont want to

Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
proclamation of love

Melvin reacts

around 155 am He sits in a chair still fully
dressed forlorn Verdell in his lap A beat then we

hear Simons whispered voice

Melvin is alarmed He stops breathing as his gay houseguest
approaches

SIMON (0S)

loudly Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin

-- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat
clearing

MELVIN
Hello

CAROL
Yeah Well

MELVIN

(very concerned)
How you doing

CAROL
I can trust my brain

MELVIN
That seems like a good choice

CAROL
I dont know whether Im being
sensible or hard on you

MELVIN
The two might go together

CAROL
See Theres an example I dont
know whether youre being cute or
crazy now

MELVIN
(what the hell)
Cute

CAROL
You dont have to answer
everything I say Just listen to
me Okay

He nods his head yes

CAROL
Its really something that youre
looking after Simon And what I
said on the street That was a
bad thing to say And it made me
sick to my stomach It was a bad
thing to say And Id be lying if
I didnt say that I enjoyed your
company but the truth is you do
bother me enormously and I know --
think -- that its best for me to
not have contact with you because
youre just not ready and youre a
pretty old guy to not be ready
and Im too old to ignore that
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place
So thanks for the trips

Shes just broken up with him but shes being nicer than
ever Its hard to know whether to die or not

MELVIN
Okay to say something now

CAROL
Go ahead

MELVIN
I shouldve danced with you

CAROL
Okay Good-bye

MELVIN
So long

Carol hangs up She feels strange A shoe hasnt dropped
Oh hell she missed him

INT MELVINS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room He
is impatient

MELVIN
You going to come talk to me or
not

SIMON

Im coming

We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be
allowed closer to Melvin Simon releases him

SIMON
What did she say

MELVIN

Im a great guy --
extraordinary

(before Simon can

celebrate)
Â» and she doesnt want contact
with me

(a beat)
Im dying here

SIMON
Because
(gently)
Â» you love her

MELVIN
(sharply)
No and youre supposed to be
sensitive and sharp

SIMON

Okay you tell me why --
(mimics him)
Youre dying here

MELVIN
I dont know Let me sleep on it
and figure it out

(then)
Because Im stuck Cant go back
to what I had Shes evicted me
from my life

SIMON
Did you like it that much

MELVIN

(furiously)
It was better than this Look
you Im very intelligent If
youre going to give me advice or
conversation or consolation or
hope you got to be better than
youre doing If you cant be at
least momentarily interesting than
shut the hell up Im drowning
and youre describing water

SIMON
(getting pissed)
Picking on me wont help

MELVIN
Well if thats true then Im
really in trouble

SIMON
But you know where youre lucky

MELVIN
Absolutely not

SIMON

You know who you want Ill take
your seat any day So do
something dont sleep on it
go over there I dont think
anybody should ever sleep on
anything -- its not always good
to let things calm down

MELVIN
Hey Im charged here But she
might kill me for showing up this
late

SIMON
Then get in your jammies and Ill
read you a story I think youve

got a chance The only real enemy
you have is her ability to think
logically -- the best thing you
have going for you is your
willingness to humiliate yourself
if it gives you one chance in
whatever -- so go catch her off-
guard
MELVIN
Okay Thanks a lot Here I go

He moves for the door stops suddenly jolted

SIMON
Whats wrong

MELVIN
I forgot to lock the door

EXT CAROLS APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROLS NEIGHBORHOOD) -
NIGHT

As he parks He exits the car -- now wary looks at
his watch hesitates walks reluctantly into the
apartment house

INT CAROLS APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

As Melvin looks at Carols doorbell with great
uncertainty

INT CAROLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Carol in a cotton wrap-around dressbathrobe sitting
directly in front of a fan the windows open reading
one of Melvins books

There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL
someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly
-- so briefly that shes not certain its her DOORBELL --
until the same brief sound REPEATED She walks to

her wide open window and looks over

HER POV

The convertible at the curb

BACK TO SCENE

She hesitates --

INT CAROLS APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT
As Melvin gives up and starts out turning as the
sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carols life sounds

He bolts for the door and enters

INT CAROLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

She opens the door she hears the sound of MELVIN
SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs He reaches her side
CAROL

What do you want Melvin
ANOTHER
Beverly

BACK TO

He half

MELVIN
Were you asleep

CAROL
What do you want

MELVIN
Cause if you were asleep -- Im
sorry And you could be grouchy

CAROL
Grouchy

MELVIN
Cause of being woken up and
it would make my job impossible
So then I wouldnt even try

CAROL
What job

MELVIN
Were you asleep

CAROL
What are you doing here

ANGLE
in the hallway looking on --
SCENE

MELVIN
Im sorry I woke you -- some other
time
turns to leave

CAROL

I wasnt asleep

MELVIN
What a break

CAROL
(losing it a bit)
Is it a secret what youre doing
here

MELVIN
I had to see you

CAROL
Because

MELVIN
It relaxes me Id feel better
just sitting on the curb in front
of your house than anyplace else
I can think of or imagine

Carol has not ever heard anything like that before
its sort of sexy in its sincerity

ANOTHER ANGLE

As we see in the bg that Beverly standing near her
door down the hallway has heard at least this last
part

Melvin of course cannot leave well enough alone

MELVIN
(serious)
Wait a minute Im overstating
here maybe the inside stairs I
dont want to sit with my feet in
the gutter What does that serve
It only

But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens

CAROL
Stop it Why cant I have a
normal boyfriend Why Get out
of here Just a regular boyfriend
who doesnt go nuts on me

BEVERLY
(butting in)
Everybody wants that dear -- it

doesnt exit
(as Carol turns
to her)
Sorry didnt mean to interrupt

She disappears into her room Carol snorts a laugh --
gathers herself A beat

MELVIN
(hopefully)
Boyfriend
CAROL

Oh come on in and try not to ruin
everything by being you

MELVIN
Maybe we could live without the
wise cracks

She looks at him -- then
CAROL
Maybe we could

Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carols kitchen
linoleum and stalls at the door

MELVIN
It feels a little confined here
Lets take a walk

CAROL
See Its four in the morning A
walk sounds a little screwy to me
if you dont mind

MELVIN
If you need an excuse theres a
bakery on the corner Theres a
shot itll open soon -- that way
were not screwy -- were just
two people who like warm rolls

CAROL
Okay

EXT STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT

They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual
attention to where he steps

CAROLS POV

Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement --
it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids
stepping on the lines

BACK TO SCENE

Carol sighs It is the sound of possibilities crashing
down Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed self-conscious
-- his habits making him appear unworthy

CAROL
(gently almost
lovingly)
Im sorry Melvin -- but whatever
this is -- is not going to work

ON MELVIN

He takes this hard It forces him to half-whisper

something he hasnt at all said to himself given his
history this is an extraordinary intimacy
MELVIN
Im feeling Ive been feeling

better
CAROL
Melvin even though it may seem
that way now -- you dont know me
all that well
(as he scoffs)
Im not the answer for you

She starts to turn He tugs at her arm As she turns
back to him

MELVIN
Hey Ive got a great compliment
for you

CAROL

You know what I

MELVIN

Just let me talk

(gathers himself

with uncertainty

then)
Im the only one on the face of
the earth who realizes that youre
the greatest woman on earth Im
the only one who appreciates how
amazing you are in every single
thing you do -- in every single
thought you have in how you
are with Spencer -- Spence

(he has reached

her)
in how you say what you mean
and how you almost always mean
something thats all about being
straight and good

ON CAROL

She stands on the precipice of being transported away
from the logic which has been her lifeline

MELVIN
I think most people miss that
about you and I watch wondering
how they can watch you bring them
food and clear their dishes and
never get that they have just met

the greatest woman alive And
the fact that I get it makes me
feel great about me

(a real question

filled with

concern for her)
You got a real good reason to walk
out on that
That last question clearly a true question not the least

rhetorical -- she considers her answer then
CAROL
No Its certainly not No -- I

dont think so No

MELVIN
(tentatively)
Im gonna grab you
(with conviction)
I didnt mean it to be a question
Im gonna grab you

He kisses her An awkward bomb of a kiss They separate
A tense beat Then

MELVIN
I know I can do better

They embrace again He does indeed do much better A
first-class smooch CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot
land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his
knowledge They break -- look at each other without a
notion of where to take it from here and the ALMOST in
unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA Melvin following a
path that avoids cracks Suddenly the lights of the
bakery turn on as it opens for business

CAROL
Warm rolls

They walk to the bakery Melvin avoiding the cracks As
they enter the bakery a WORKER moves toward them to
clean the entranceway Melvin forced to step back onto
a crack this time notices -- registers the momentous
fact and joins Carol inside as we

FADE OUT

THE END
