Kate looks around blase about what she’s seeing

ADAM
You don’t buy the little stuff

ADAM
It’s better to just get rid of it
all at once like this right I
mean it’s a bunch of junk and I’m
a busy person

KATE
Oh definitely You don’t want to
have to worry about it

ADAM
(chuckling)
I’1ll probably get rid of some
priceless thing and not know it
right Like this

He holds up a vase that’s decorated with gold leaves

KATE
Oh I don’t think you have to
concern yourself with that
(beat)

A two bedroom apartment bright and cluttered but stylishly
decorated

Kate is cooking dinner while her DAUGHTER ABBY 15 does
homework at the table Abby is in an awkward stage of
development and has a bad case of acne

KATE
Why does she hate us so much What
did we do to her

ABBY
She sees you she sees death
You’re a vulture

KATE
Us buying that apartment has no
down side Her grandmother’s still
living there we’re not hovering
The only difference to her is that
now she pays her rent to us instead
of the sponsor And we didn’t even
raise it

ABBY
You’re a saint

KATE
(beat)
Maybe she’s mean because she has a
prettier sister

ABBY
Mom

KATE
I’ve seen the older one She’s kind
of gorgeous in a low rent way

ABBY
The younger one is okay looking
Maybe she likes how she looks

KATE
I doubt it It’s hard to have a
prettier sister

Untitled Nicole Holofcener Project 2008 - Yellow 51908

KATE
It’s just so sad

ABBY
What

KATE
The old lady Andra I mean does
she ever go outside

ABBY
What’s so fun outside

KATE
The world Life

ABBY
Maybe she’s perfectly happy

KATE
That’s how you rationalize so you
don’t have to feel bad for her

ABBY
Why do I have to feel bad for her

KATE
She’s a lonely old woman at the end
of her life

ABBY
That’s not my fault

ALEX Kate’s husband comes into the room sifting through
photos He’s 42 and attractive despite a pot belly and
unkempt hair

at the couch the guys are sitting on

KATE
What’s wrong with that piece

ALEX
(quietly)
It’s not comfortable

KATE
We should take it off the floor

ALEX
(to shouting to Man 2)
It’s very comfortable

KATE
Why did you do that

ALEX
He might think it’s comfortable

KATE
That’s not possible

ALEX
You don’t know that

She watches Alex return to the shoppers and tell them the
price By their body language she can tell they don’t want
the couch She’s vindicated

I am not spending two hundred
dollars on a pair of jeans for my

Mary comes out of the kitchen with a bulging unopened can of
grapefruit juice

MARY
This has botulism

Rebecca and Andra look at her blankly Mary replaces it in
the kitchen and then returns

MARY

than me but if she were prettier
than me I’d understand But she’s
not and she’s got this tan -
totally sprayed on - I would know
The worst part is her back though

KATE
(trying)
Are you still in love with him

ANDRA
He broke up with her

MARY
That’s not how it went down

ALEX
What’s wrong with her back

MARY
It’s muscular All built up And
she wears these skimpy tops

ALEX

MARY
No right Big Back is not good

REBECCA
Enough about her back

KATE

Abby enters with a pair of underwear over her head

ALEX

ABBY
No I’d rather someone admit it At
least then I don’t feel crazy
Untitled Nicole Holofcener Project 2008 - Yellow 51908

MARY
I know exactly what you’re saying
Half the time I do feel crazy

ABBY
Nobody ever says the truth

MARY
They should If you get a sucky
haircut people should admit it If
some doctor procedure is going to
hurt they should say it’s going to
hurt It makes you feel worse if
they lie

ABBY
I hate it when people don’t say
bless you

MARY
You know what I hate When you’re
in like a store and you hold the
door for the person behind you but
then they don’t hold the door for
the person behind them And you’re
standing there like a fucking
doorman

ABBY
And they don’t say thank you

MARY
Of course not ‘Cause you’re not
there

And at that she opens her purse pulls out a lip gloss and
aggressively applies it

MARY
Jesus sometimes I swear I must be
invisible

She hands the lip gloss to Abby who takes it flattered

Shoulder massage hand massage Do

ALEX
Sure

As Mary massages his fingers there’s a silence that
ordinarily could seem normal but here and now is filled
with tension

As Mary massages his hand he starts to massage hers back
Shes confused Maybe he doesn’t even know he’s doing it
Then he gently pulls her closer to him She’s not sure if
this is on purpose or not He pulls again She looks at him
but he’s wearing those little eye cups so she can’t read his
expression This goes on for a while until he pulls her even
closer making his intentions unmistakable

Her body is now up against the table as Alex reaches for her
He sits up losing his eye cups and suddenly they’re
kissing

After a moment they break apart and Mary fumbles for the eye
cups on the floor

speechless She searches in her wallet and takes out a five
dollar bill

thinking

KATE
The guy His sister or wife or
whoever was so mean I had to buy
it I felt bad for him
(reaching)
And who’s to say that this stuff
isn’t valuable

ALEX
I can This stuff isn’t valuable

KATE
Somebody designed it Maybe in
fifteen years this chair -
(gestures to yellow chair)
- will be worth a ton of money
because some genius German
designed it

ALEX
Well never sell any of it

Kate goes and sits in the yellow chair

I already sold one piece for a lot
of money

about it

ALEX
That’s great

KATE
No it’s not

ALEX
I don’t understand

KATE
I practically stole from them

ALEX
So why did you charge them a lot of
money

She thinks about this surprised by it

KATE
(beat)
I wanted to

ALEX
And therein lies the mystery of
being human

KATE
And I’ve been feeling very
suspicious lately Alex

He freezes Waits Suddenly his face softens with guilt

KATE
A couple of people have come in
here people who don’t look like
they’re shopping for our kind of
furniture And they’re asking
questions

ALEX
(relieved)
Like what

Untitled Nicole Holofcener Project 2008 - Yellow 51908

KATE
Like “where did you get this” And
“How do you find your things” You
heard those two rude people

ALEX
People ask that all the time
Theyre curious

KATE
No I think that some of the people
weve bought from asked their
friends or their lawyers to come
in and see how much we’re charging

ALEX
Your guilt is warping you

KATE
(beat)
Why isn’t it warping you

ALEX
It is Your guilt is warping me

She smirks at him

ALEX
If doing this makes you feel so bad
let’s stop doing it

KATE
But then someone else will just do
what we’re doing The guy on eighth
avenue - you know that store He’s
buying from us and selling it for
more Us quitting isn’t going to
help

(beat)

Nothing helps
