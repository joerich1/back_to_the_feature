THE BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE IN TEXAS

OPENING TITLE CARDS

After the Universal logo we open on a slow pan across a
turn-of-the-century dressing table We see old photo-
graphs showing a small group of whores with their madam
MISS WULLA JEAN and the Sheriff of the small town of
Gilbert SHERIFF JACK ROY WALLACE There are also mementos
on the dressing table a watch reading glasses a jeweled
hand mirror a hair brush etc We play the Production
Company the Miller-Milkis-Boyett Presents and the Film
By” credits over these things and then push in on an antique
stereopticon with the double photo image of a small newly
built two-story Victorian house situated on a wooded hill
in the East Texas countryside

The two images optically move together to form one image
They become live action and the NARRATOR begins as we push
in on the house where a horse and wagon is pulling up to the
porch

NARRATOR
It was the nicest little whorehouse
you ever saw It lay about a mile
outside the city limits

EXT CHICKEN RANCH - DAY
Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace and Miss Wulla Jean pose with the
girls on the front porch of the house as a photographer
takes their picture with an old flash-powder camera

NARRATOR
Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace picked it
out for Miss Wulla Jean and her
girls in 1910 when they moved there
from over the hardware store on
Main Street

We pan down through the leaves of a tree to reveal two girls
working in a little garden by the side of the house It has
the appearance of a turn-of-the-century ladies college as
the other girls cut flowers sit around the grape arbor and
sun-dry their long hair

(NOTE We can bleed in the color slowly beginning with

black and white then sepia then full color during the
1940s)

NARRATOR
(singing)
Oh the little house lay in a
Green Texas glade
Where the trees were as coolin
As fresh lemonade
Soft summer wind
Had a trace of perfume
And a fan was turnin’
In every room

INT CHICKEN RANCH - DAY 1900

We see the old ceiling fans turning followed by several
shots through the fans of the girls making love under the
sheets squeaking mattress shots bouncing bedsprings with
a chamber pot under the bed

CHORUS
Twenty fans were turnin
They were turnin
Twenty fans were turnin
In every room
Fevers were a-burnin
They were burnin
And they had to have
A way to cool down

INT CHICKEN RANCH - NIGHT
Miss Wulla Jean stands at the front door welcoming customers
entering the house We see the keys of a pianola start
playing ragtime as the girls and customers break into a
turn-of-the-century-style dance

NARRATOR
Miss Wulla Jean had a strict set of
rules but she liked her ladies as
she called them to treat her
customers real good

The dancing continues as Miss Wulla Jean makes sure her
girls are behaving in a ladylike way

NARRATOR
She put a pianola in the parlor to
sorta help break the ice A feller
could ask a girl to dance or if he
held back a little shed ask him
And pretty soon theyd get a little
business going two dollars worth

The dance ends with a couple upstairs falling into bed

NARRATOR
For over three generations the
little house went about its
business while the town prospered
and those folks that couldnt
approve of the Chicken Ranch at
least decided it fell under the
principle of peaceful coexistence

president puts down her stereopticon on the hall table and
Jewel wheels her away We push in on the stereopticon and
see it contains the old sepia shot of the little house taken
so many long years ago

that they were selling something
out there other than poultry

Jewel enters and stands in the doorway Shy stops crying
and Mona wipes away Shys tears

SHY
Im sorry Miss Mona

MONA
Thats all right honey I know
how you feel
(singing)
Bein born was the worst and the first
Mistake I ever made
The doctor didnt spank me
He just slapped me in the face
And the cup of love was always quenchin
Someone elses thirst
Leaving me to swallow
The bitter taste of hurt

‘Cause I was raised an orphan
Never wanted as a kid

Until the year I turned thirteen
Then everybody did —

Strangers passed me back and forth
Men just took me as they pleased
And others had a Cinderella slave
To cook and clean and weave

Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose you have to play

The hand that life has dealt you

And its a gamble either way

On a dusty road at fifteen

In a yellow cotton dress

With the desert sun like an angry dragon
Breathin down my neck

And the dry cracked plains that made me think
Of a prehistoric time

Should I fear what lay before me

Less than what Id left behind

A fifteen year old girl dont have

No trouble hitchin rides

But sometimes when youre ridin free
Youll pay the highest price

On back roads and in backseats

And in cheap highway motels

But whats a few more strangers

In a life of nothin’ else

02139 43

- 5
MONA (Contd)
(singing)
Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose you have to play
The hand that life has dealt you
And its a gamble either way

Sixteen found me cryin

Underneath a scarlet light

On the doorstep of a stranger

On a cold and rainy night

When I walked into the parlor here
The pieces seemed to fit

I was good at pleasin strangers
So I made the most of it

Either way its all a gamble
So view the stakes and know the odds
‘Lay your cards upon the table
Do your dealin from the top

Though the deck is stacked against you
Win or lose you have to play
The hand that life has dealt you
And its a gamble either way
(spoken)
Yeah its a gamble either way

Jewel who has been listening through the song glances over
at Mona A look of recognition passes between them Shy
looks up at Jewel

SHY
Miss Monas gonna let me stay

JEWEL
Thats wonderful child but after
talking to you this afternoon it
dont surprise me none

Mona smiles at Jewel and walks out to the hallway to beckon
to the girls passing by

MONA
Girls come on in here

Ginger and Ruby Rae enter Mona introduces them to Shy

MONA

Commissioner driving a city car

broke a thirty share And its
affecting my pieces on the late
night news Up Up Up They
love my little report

ED EARL
Ive heard youre very popular

MELVIN
The power of television -- of
public exposure -- is so great it
scares me I swear I could get
the Mayors own children to throw
rocks at him Which show did you
like best

ED EARL
(after a beat)
Well II thought the peanuts in
the chocolate bar

One of my favorites Three score
means sixty like the Bible says

whole nuts not half nuts or nut
bits or nut chips Were talking a
full nut

ED EARL
I can see that

MELVIN
Thank God we still live ina
society where anything thats phony
or dishonest cant stand the light
of day

He puts on his shirt over his padded shoulders and gets one
pad caught Ed Earl points it out

ED EARL
Your pad there

MELVIN
Oh thanksYes most corporations
involved in false advertising will
just laugh at a fifty dollar fine
but if you show up with a TV camera
and give em bad publicity they
shape up faster than goose shit
through a tin horn

ED EARL
Its that bad publicity that I want
to talk to you about Sometimes it
can hurt people Like this report
I hear youre planning on the
Chicken Ranch That place has been
operating peacefully for a long
time Hell I wouldnt be
surprised if your granddaddy took
your daddy out there to learn about
the birds and the bees

MELVIN
Im from New Jersey

ED EARL

ED EARL
The point I want to make is every
schoolboy in the state knows about
it most politicians have slept
there and the town the Mayor and
the folks who elected me want to
keep things the way they are

MELVIN
What is your interest in this
whorehouse Sheriff

ED EARL
Well my deputies patrol out there
stop fights before they start The
girls police records are checked
so are their health cards And as
for getting information that helps
us solve crimes why the Chicken
Ranch is a better intelligence-
gathering operation than all those
FBI flyers they keep mailing me

MELVIN
You know Sheriff it just struck
me Were in the same profession

ED EARL
Whats that

MELVIN
Law enforcement Im out there
fighting for the rights of the
public just like you Were both
of us protecting the people -- you
in the old way me in the new

ED EARL
The new

MELVIN
Television Im the electronic
bounty hunter I use a camera you

be doing everybody a big favor if

He begings

02139 49

ED EARL (Contd)
youd drop this whole thing The
girls perform a wanted service and
right or wrong

MELVIN
Right or wrong dont interest me

to the preacher

Ed Earl is a bit taken back by this admission and a little
confused Bee

ED EARL
Really Well Im glad to hear
that The Mayor was feeling that
youd stir up a lot of unnecessary
publicity

MELVIN
Unnecessary publicity Hes got me
all wrong Im not one of those
sensation mongers out for their
own egos

He finishes dressing and stands looking at himself in front
of the mirror

MELVIN
What do you think

ED EARL

I designed it myself No you tell
your Mayor hes got nothing to fear
from me on that score

Brown Shirts and the Nazi terrors

In the early morning light we discover Ed Earl unshaven and
remorseful having stayed up all night strolling by the
viverbank alone with his thoughts

After a series of shots he begins to sing

ED EARL
Sometimes I get crazy
As fools are known to do
Lose my head in spite of
Everything I stand to lose
What is it in a man
That makes him act like
Such a fool
I swear I never knew
But always needed to

Stubborn pride is just the way of stallions
I suppose

Even love cant change

The things I want to change the most

And its pride thats got me standin

When I should be on my knees

Making apologies

But its so damn hard for me

Oh but now and again

I wish Id a been a poet

So I could know the perfect lines
To say

Have some great romantic way

To show it

Be the hero ridin up

To save the day

And Id go ridin high

Like a knight in shining armor

Just sweep her up and race into the sun
But I dont have no magic ways

To charm her

No its lonely in the fields

Where stallions run

And Id like to say I love you
But those words just dont come
Words like that are no match
For the kind that rule my tongue
But I can only hope she knows

I love her anyway

No matter what I say

Oh but I never say

02139

ED EARL (Contd)
Oh now and again
I wish Id a been a poet
So I could know the perfect lines
To say
And have some great romantic way
To show it
Be the hero that rides up
To save the day

But Id never be a knight

In shining armor

And as for poets

I was never one

Im just a fool that must
Restore his honor

Oh the winds are cold

That blow where stallions run

Im just a fool that must
Restore his honor

Or only walk in fields
Where stallions run

Legalized prostitution -- pro or
con - is in the news again today
We now take you to Jeff Gerald in
Gilbert Texas

We pan off the No Entry sign across the front road leading
to the Chicken Ranch up to JEFF GERALD with a microphone
talking into the camera Some deputies and a few sightseers
are parked in the background

GERALD
The Chicken Ranch the legendary
long-running bawdy house is showing
little activity after the
disclosure yesterday of the
Thanksgiving night raid A deputy
at the front gate keeps away
onlookers and potential customers

while up at the house the shutters
are closed and the principals not
talking

We cut to newsreel film shot earlier where we catch a
glimpse of Mona behind the window curtains and Jewel shooing
off reporters from the front porch We also see a cut of Ed
Earl walking from his car to his office refusing to talk to
the press

GERALD (vo)
The Sheriff of Gilbert Ed Earl
Dodd refused interviews while in
Houston the man who launched the -
campaign consumer advocate Melvin
P Thorpe held a press conference
this afternoon

We cut to filmed footage shot in Melvinss studio

MELVIN
I have a report here that says the
Chicken Ranch is involved with and
under the influence of organized
crime and I will be taking this
report to Austin in the hope that
the Governor will come out of his
long silence on this issue and
uphold the law

After an establishing shot of the Austin Capitol we cut to
a press conference in Senator Wingwoods office

GERALD (v0)
At the Capitol today the Governor
made no statement but Senator
Charles Wingwood who was a
principal figure in the watchdog
News raid also held a press
conference explaining his
involvement

The Senator nervously reads his prepared statement

SENATOR
I have no independent recollection
of going to the Chicken Ranch and I
can only say as the most dedicated
anti-communist in the state

SENATOR (Contd)

legislature that I must have been

drugged by communists or communist

sympathizers and placed there to

harm my reputation and good name

So I am now calling on every

freedom-loving American to call the

Governor and have this shameful

place shut down

In the town square of Gilbert Gerald has set up his cameras
and is about to interview some local citizens

GERALD
Reaction across the state is split
fiftyfifty but in the town of
Gilbert itself the Chicken Ranch
has many supporters

We cut to Edsel the newspaper editor

EDSEL

Ive never seen anything bad come

from it and Ive lived here all my
om life It brings in business for

the community and they pay taxes

same as anyone else Besides

no one ever was forced to go up

there

We cut to HENRY a tough redneck farmer

HENRY

The Chicken Ranch I think its a
good idea You take a lot of young
boys theyre going to be looking
for women If they cant find em
theyll rape ‘em and if they dont
do that theyll run to other women
and get diseases Those girls went
to doctors

We cut to DORA a sweet and proper old lady in town

DORA

My Frank when he was alive used
to go up there every Saturday I
took it as a blessing Course it
was different then Nowadays women
enjoy doing that sort of thing

i themselves -- least thats what

of the Gilbert courthouse

GERALD
Although petitions are being
circulated to Save the Chicken
Ranch this bumper sticker is
already beginning to appear around
the state

He holds up a sticker saying Pluck the Chicken Ranch

GERALD
And so as feminists line up behind
the bill for the decriminalization
of prostitution already in the
legislature and as traditionalists
and fundamentalists lobby for its
defeat the fate of the Chicken
Ranch rests with the Governor who
today was again unavailable for
comment Jeff Gerald CBS News in

law-abiding citizens who supply a
demand and provide an economic
asset to the community

whorehouse sound like a damn
non-profit recreational facility

Governor if the citizens who

‘elected me had found it necessary

to close it for any reason I would
do it If Miss Mona and her girls
were jeopardizing the health
wealth or moral scruples of the
community I would do it If the
place had even been just a piddlin
nuisance an eyesore or even a
fire hazard I would close it
down But theres nothing No
reason except the cries of this
muckraking sensationalist on
television
