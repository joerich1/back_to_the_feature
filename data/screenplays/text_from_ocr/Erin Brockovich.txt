ERIN BROCKOVICH
A True Story

by

Susannah Grant

February 1 1998

EXT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB MAIN DRAG - DAY

Palms sway the sun washes everything in yellow cars
motor down either side of the landscaped median the calls
of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms

ON THE SIDEWALK a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk
past the foot traffic of Southern Californians flip-flops
Doc Martens Rollerblades Nikes then in the middle of
this pedestrian normalcy a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-
HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop So high it hurts to look
at them As the shoes leave frame we TILT UP and see
theyre leaving a 99-cent store

As the Pumps turn and head up the street we see they are
connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG SHAPELY LEGS
Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going

They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break The men
pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful
woman In fact everyone this woman passes lets their eyes
rest on her a microsecond longer than usual

- Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the
tops of her thighs

- A MAILMAN spots the BIG DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a
MOUNTAIN OF BIG BLOND HAIR

- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the
TIGHT BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER

It isnt until she rounds the corner at the end of the block
that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is
so goggle-eyed Eye-catching is an understatement All
those folks who say Barbies proportions are unrealistic have
obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH

EXT AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

A side street No pedestrians just parked cars A PARKING
TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai

ERIN
Fuck

Even when she talks dirty theres a heartland goodness to
her voice Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze

As she grabs the ticket from the windshield her sunglasses
accidentally CLATTER to the ground

ERIN
Shit

When she picks them up a fingernail snags on the pavement

ERIN
God damn it

She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in
WIDER ON THE STREET

The Hyundai starts it up signals Then just as it pulls
slowly out into the street a JAGUAR barrels around the
corner accelerating out of the turn and rams into the side
of Erins car sending it CAREENING into the median It
SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost And stops

EXT MASRY and VITITOE - DAY

A boring building on a boring block in the Valley surrounded
by strip malls Definitely not where the power lawyers work

ROSALIND (0S)
Morning Mr Masry How you doing today

INT MASRY and VITITOE RECEPTION - DAY

Generic Cottage cheese ceilings motel art A sign over
the reception desk reads MASRY and VITITOE ATTORNEYS AT LAW

ED MASRY senior partner slumps by ROSALIND his chipper
receptionist with a cup of coffee in his hand Hes in his
mid-50s compact and -- even though its only 9 AM --
already rumpled

ED
Dont ask that on Mondays Rosalind

Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that
is his career has long since dissipated He trundles off
toward his office

INT MASRY and VITITOE OUTSIDE EDS OFFICE - DAY

Eds secretary BRENDA -- 50s jaded hates her job but what

He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk reads the card

BRENDA
Tequila From your drug dealer friend

ED
Carlos isnt a friend hes a client

BRENDA
Hes a low-life Speaking of which thats
your nine oclock in there

Ed peers into his office Its a mess -- papers everywhere
unopened mail Standing in the middle of the room is Erin
in a teensy leopard-print mini-dress As she jiggles a
spike-heeled foot everything about her shimmies gloriously
Except her head which is held in place by a neck brace

ED
Whoa
(to Brenda)

BRENDA

fault she says

(sarcastic)

And she looks like such an honest girl dont
you think

ED
You shouldnt judge Brenda

BRENDA

As Ed heads into his office Brenda picks up the phone

BRENDA
I cant find him Tony Well have to call

INT MASRY and VITITOE EDS OFFICE - DAY

Not an office that exudes authority and Eds blustery
entrance only adds to the sense of chaos

ED
Erin -- hi Sorry you had to wait Here
sit down sit down

He clears a stack of papers off a chair

ERIN
Thanks a lot
(as she sits)
I tell you I never thought just standing
would take it out of me but ever since that
shithead hit me it feels like my whole
bodys put together wrong

Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy

ED
Jesus you poor thing
(he sits)
Well listen you came to the right place
Whoever did this to you made one hell of a
mistake and you and me were gonna make
him pay for it

He takes out a pad and paper gets ready to write

ED
Why dont you tell me what happened
DISSOLVE TO
INT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY

Erin is on the stand wearing the most conservative thing she
owns a red form-fitting mini dress telling her story to
Ed whos questioning her

ERIN
I was pulling out real slow and out of
nowhere his Jaguar comes racing around the
corner like a bat outta hell

She glances at the defendants table where a DOCTOR sits
nobly in surgical scrubs His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS
are behind him A frigging Norman Rockwell painting

conservative family values Oh shit

LATER IN HER TESTIMONY

ERIN
(getting defensive)

But I woulda worked for sure if I didnt

Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem
Erin gives it a tug pulling it down a stitch

DEFENDING LAWYER
(sarcastic)

Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances Great

The defendants lawyers is on the offensive Erins starting
to feel the case slipping away

So You mustve been feeling pretty
desperate that afternoon

ERIN
(pointed)
Whats your point

Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- dont get mad
DEFENDING LAWYER

Broke three kids no job A doctor ina
Jaguar mustve looked like a pretty good
meal ticket

Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement
Shes on a sinking ship

ERIN
What Hey -- he hit me

DEFENDING LAWYER

ERIN
He came tearing around the corner out of
control --

DEFENDING LAWYER
An ER doctor who spends his days saving
lives was the one out of control --

Im sorry about that Really But --

ERIN

I dont need pity I need a paycheck And

Ive looked but when youve spent the last

six years raising babies its real hard to

convince someone to give you a job that pays

be the one to hire me

Ed sees everyone watching him listening

ED
Id love to help Erin but Im sorry I

He starts to escort her out but she stays put

deliver on I trusted you With my kids
well-being Now Im smart and Im hard-

got another thing coming

ERIN (0S)
Whoa whoa Easy easy easy --

WIDEN to see Erin phone to her ear grabbing a carton of
juice from Matt and Katie who are fighting over it at the
table Just as she takes it from them the phone picks up

DONNAS VOICE (0S)
Hi Youve reached the Irvings Leave a
message and well get back to you just as
soon aS we can Bye-bye

BEEP Erin thinks a bit then hangs up and looks at the
file Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings address in
Hinkley California

EXT LA FREEWAY - DAY

The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of LA DISCO MUSIC
blares from its speakers

EXT HINKLEY CA - DAY

This is a dry desolate part of California No downtown no
community Just tract after tract of arid farmland with
small bland unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the
landscape like occasional tombstones

A beat-up old sign on the road reads HINKLEY CA POP
but the corner where the number would be has broken off

As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields Erin turns onto
Community Boulevard the main road that cuts through Hinkley

INT ERINS HYUNDAI - DAY
Erin looks around

The house shes passing has been razed

A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property

As she checks the piece of paper with Donnas address
a massive gray
chimneys and ladders
Erin passes it without noticing it

drives by the PGandE COMPRESSOR STATION
structure of pipes

She stops at an intersection
been boarded up with plywood

she

the dirt She rings the bell It has a melody chime

scrappy high-strung manner Shes wearing tight jeans
her dark curls are piled on top of her head

and

ERIN
Hi Donna Irving

them You got a minute

INT THE IRVINGS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

The house is furnished with little money but lots of care
Erins on a plaid couch in a sea of needlepoint pillows
Out back two GIRLS ages 9 and 11 are playing in a pool

ERIN
This is a real nice place you got here

DONNA (0S)
Well it oughta be with all the work I put
into it

She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea

DONNA
I added air conditioning put in the pool
made all those pillows by hand

ERIN
Yeah I should learn to do stuff like that
They make the place feel real homey

Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows

DONNA
Thank you I think so too Thats why Im
being such a stickler on this house price
thing I dont mean to be a pain in PGandEs
backside especially after all theyve done
for Hinkley but I look around here and I
think if they want this place theyre
gonna have to pay for it And I dont just
mean pay for the house Id like them to pay
me for the trouble of starting over

ERIN
Right

DONNA
Cause first you gotta move then theres
decorating and if the windows arent the
same size you know -- youre making all new
curtains Honest to God I dont know if I
have the energy You know Ive been sick
Me and Peter both have

ERIN
Yeah Im real glad you brought that up I
was going through your file here and I ran
into these medical records They kinda
surprised me --

This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self-
pitying But not Donna Lifes handed her a shitload of
lemons and darned if she hasnt made a shitload of lemonade

DONNA
I know Theyre more than a bit unusual
See two years ago Pete got Hodgkins
disease Thats a kind of cancer --

ERIN
Yeah Im real sorry to hear that

DONNA

Thank you Its in remission now thank the
Lord but you never know And then while
thats going on I end up having to have a
hysterectomy Plus a whole mess of lumps
removed from my breasts All benign so far
but still no matter how positive you stay
an operation can still take it out of you

ERIN
Ill say Holy moley

DONNA
So the whole idea of selling the house --
dont get me wrong Id be glad to move to
some better place but if they arent gonna
pay us properly I just dont see the point

ERIN
Yeah I can see that
(beat)
I guess the only thing that confused me is -
- not that your medical problems arent
important but -- how come the files about
them are in with all the real estate stuff

Donna tops off their iced teas

DONNA
Are you kidding With how our lives are if
I start subdividing files Ill be sunk I
just kept all PGandE correspondence in one
place

ERIN
Right but -- Im sorry I dont see why you
were corresponding with PGandE about it in the
first place

DONNA
Well they paid for the doctors visit

ERIN
They did

DONNA
You bet Paid for a check-up for the whole
family And not like with insurance where
you pay then wait a year to be reimbursed
either They just took care of it Just
like that We never even saw a bill

ERIN
Wow Why would they do that

DONNA
Cause of the chromium

ERIN
The what

DONNA
The chromium Well thats what kicked this
whole thing off

INT IRVING HOUSE GARAGE - DAY
CLOSE ON A BOX with CHROM INFO scrawled on it

DONNA (0S)
PGandE came around a few years ago told us
they put chromium in our well by mistake
And since we shouldnt have to drink it if
we dont want to they gave us free spring
water and offered to buy our house

WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room

ERIN
Whats chromium

DONNA
Its a chemical they used over at that
compressor station up the road there

ERIN
Well hell maybe thats why you all have
been so sick --

DONNA
I thought the same thing right off the bat
Thats why we went to see the doctor But
hunh-uh Turns out ones got nothing to do
with the other

She rifles through the box

DONNA
This is the info they gave us Youll see
if you look through it chromiums good for
you When I saw what they charged for it at
the health-food stores I about fainted

She hands Erin a printed fact sheet Erin scans it

ERIN
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your
water being messed with and you being so
sick

DONNA

Not around here This is a rough part of
the world Hard times not a lot of money
not a lot of luck

(beat)
Its a challenge staying healthy in a town
like this Heck even our dogs up and die

INT ERINS CAR - NIGHT

Erins driving away from Donnas house A street lamp throws
light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat

She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at
the massive COMPRESSOR STATION Six stories high lit up
like a Christmas tree with all sizes of PIPES criss-crossing
the outside and GIANT COOLING TOWERS sticking up out of it
Far more massive than anything else in town it looms over
the horizon like the Capitol in DC or St Peters in Rome

Erin takes a long look at the compressor station then turns
onto Community Boulevard and drives away

being loyal was the way to get ahead

EDS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ed is still checking his reflection

INT MASRY and VITITOE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum To say
this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement He
doesnt talk he squeaks

BAUM
in the interest of putting this whole
thing to rest PGandE is willing to offer the
Irvings 250000 dollars for their home

Ed laughs a little in disbelief

ED
250000

BAUM
In terms of land value out in Hinkley Mr
Masry we feel its a more than fair price

ED
What about in terms of medical expenses
250000 doesnt come close to what this
familys gonna have to spend on doctors

BAUM
I understand theyve had a bad run of luck
health-wise and they have my sympathies
But thats not PGandEs fault

ED
Youre kidding right
(Baum doesnt answer)
Look at these readings for Christs sake
PGandEs own technicians documented toxic
levels of hexavalent chromium in those test
wells on numerous occasions

Ed shoves them across the table Baum doesnt look at them

ED
Everything the Irvings have had is a proven
reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium
Theyve had

He stalls a moment Erin jumps in

ERIN
-- breast cysts uterine cancer Hodgkins
disease immune deficiencies asthma
chronic nosebleeds

Despite their persuasiveness Baum parrots what is obviously
the party line

BAUM
A million things could have caused those
problems Poor diet bad genes
irresponsible lifestyle Our offer is final
and more than fair

ED
Wait a minute -- I thought we were
negotiating here

BAUM

250000 is all Im authorized to offer
Ed looks across at this pissant little kid

ED
(to himself)
Jesus Christ
(he stands to leave)
I will present your offer to my clients I
doubt theyll accept it

As Ed starts out

BAUM
Mr Masry before you go off on some
crusade you might want to remember who it
is youre dealing with here PGandE is a 28-
billion dollar corporation

all information packets on chromium Ed is standing in front
of them a little stiff

PETE
If PGandE messed with our water why would
they bother saying anything about it to us
Why not just keep quiet about it

ED
To establish a statute of limitations See
in a case like this you only have a year
from the time you first learn about the
problem to file suit So PGandE figures
well let the cat out of the bag -- tell the
people the waters not perfect if we can
ride out the year with no one suing well
be in the clear forever

DONNA
But it was more than a year ago that they
told us --

ED

Its okay Were not suing All were
doing is using this information to get you
a real nice purchase price on your house
and get you two --

(to the Browns)
-- a comparable retroactive bonus added to
your sale price This way and PGandE can
still look good to their shareholders cause
theyre not involved in an ugly lawsuit all
theyre doing is buying a little property

Erin is up at the map eating Chinese food

ERIN

They used the hex chrom here in these
cooling tanks as an anti-corrosive Then
they dumped it here in these six ponds

ED
I dont remember seeing any ponds up there

She bites into a forkful of food keeps talking

ERIN
They covered em over And not too
carefully either cause you dig one inch
under the surface and the dirt is green as
a fucking shamrock

ED
And thats what caused the contamination

ERIN
It didnt help but no The real problems
on the bottom

She reaches for a document reads from it

ERIN
See according to this they were supposed
to line the ponds so this shit couldnt seep
into the ground But guess what --

ED
They skipped that step

ERIN
I guess it was a little too inconvenient
So for fourteen years this stuff flowed
into the groundwater free as you please

ED
Jesus
(beat)
I dont even wanna ask what you did to make
this Melendez guy talk
In response to the insinuation Erin gives him a glare

ERIN
For your information Frank cares what was
in those ponds cause he used to spend half
his day wading around them That was his

job

ED
No shit

ERIN
No --

Suddenly her eyes pop out of her head --

Oh see now that pisses me off First of

know how to divide and two million dollars
isnt shit when its split between them

Mario and Anna exchange a look This is getting interesting
ED
Erin --

But theres no stopping her

ERIN
And second of all -- these people dont
dream about being rich They dream about
being able to watch their kids swim in a
pool without worrying theyll have to have a
hysterectomy at age 20 like Rosa Diaz -- a
client of ours -- or have their spine
deteriorate like Stan Bloom Another client
of ours So before you come back here with
another lame-ass offer I want you to think
real hard about what your spine is worth
Mr Buda -- or what youd expect someone to
pay you for your uterus Miss Sanchez --

multiply that number by a hundred Anything

anything linking this to PGandE corporate

ERIN
And if you had to guess

ED
With nothing linking it to the corporate
offices yet Id say well end up on the
lower end of that Still a lot of money

ERIN
So why would PGandE offer it

ED
Because They know the evidence they know
theyre gonna lose a jury trial Maybe they
wouldnt lose 400 million bucks but once
you factor in all theyd spend on this case
in the next ten years it makes a lot of --

ERIN
Wait what do you mean ten years
ED
Five years maybe for a trial Double that
for the appeal

ERIN
(confused)
Im sorry are you saying that if this thing
goes to trial itll be ten years before
these plaintiffs see their money

ED
Hey thats not so bad Compare it to the
Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago and

those people still havent seen a dime So
in legal terms ten years is --

ERIN

Fuck legal terms Were talking about human
beings here Sick people A whole bunch of
them are gonna be dead in ten years They
need their money now

ERIN
Fuck Kurt
ED
Erin --
ERIN
No Im serious You know what Kurt Potter

is Hes the kind of guy who never would
have taken this case in the first place

these plaintiffs down the river when PGandE
offered 20 million He doesnt work like
us Ed Theres no little voice in his head
