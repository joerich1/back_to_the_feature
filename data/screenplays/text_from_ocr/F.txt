The screen is BLACK
A few long moments of SILENCE

Now we hear the voice of a YOUNG WOMAN (whose name we shall
soon come to learn is NORA)

NORA (VO)
Father

As she says the word an ornate letter

F

emerges from the darkness purple against black as Nora
continues to speak

NORA (contd) (VO) (contd)
Father in his dressing gown Leafing through
an old book Father staring out the window
in our modern little house

FADE TO

EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS - WELL AFTER MIDNIGHT

Its a crisp February night The house- and street-lights
glitter enchantingly Everything is still Everyone is asleep

Almost everyone We PICK UP and FOLLOW a car swiftly rounding
the curves of Nichols Canyon up towards Mulholland

NORA (contd) (VO)
Thats-- Who my father is now Wool and
leather and shaving soap

FEATURING THE CAR

A 1961 Lincoln convertible in concours condition Sixteen
coats of hand-rubbed ebony lacquer glisten in the moonlight

ON THE DRIVER

A handsome man of perhaps sixty years driving with casual
assurance as the cool night air ruffles his hair

NORA (contd) (VO) (contd)
But what was he like-- Before
(beat)
What was he like before he was my father
What he-- Did Who he-- Was
Like the car he drives this man is a classic His name is
CHARLES SWANN There are lines in his face marks of character
of a life well lived

NORA (contd) (VO) (contd)
How can a girl know How can a girl ever
know

EXT SUNSET BOULEVARD - LATE NIGHT - THE CONVERTIBLE

rides the crest of the Hollywood Hills its sleek mass
silhouetted against the lights of Los Angeles below

NORA (contd) (VO)

Theres what he tells me-- Which is nothing
(beat)
What he shows me-- Which is nothing

And we begin to be aware of ANOTHER CAR a white Rolls Royce
following the Lincoln at a discreet distance

NORA (contd) (VO) (contd)
Then every once in a while theres-- A look
on his face when someone something reminds
him of the past

CLOSER ON SWANN

as he distractedly toys with the buttons on the car radio Now
he finds an all-night college radio station playing loud fast
rocknroll Its not the kind of music youd expect a man of
his age his bearing to like

RADIO (VO)
There are many ways to get what you want I
use the best I use the rest I want to
destroy all passersby

He turns it up loud And at the top of his lungs SINGS
along

SWANN
--and I wanna be

(beat)
Anarchy

EXT NEUTRA HOUSE - NIGHT

A house by Richard Neutra spare of line elegant of proportion
In one of its curtain-glass windows we see a

YOUNG WOMAN
looking out into the night Its dark her face is indistinct
but even now we sense her beauty and the intensity of her
focus Though weve no real way of knowing something tells us
that this is the woman whose voice weve been hearing-- That
this is NORA

We hear the SOUND of an approaching automobile

EXT MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NEUTRA HOUSE - NIGHT

Swanns Lincoln pulls up the long driveway of the house into
its space in the open carport As pulls to a stop we make note
of the license plate which bears one simple centered letter

F

A hundred yards back on Mulholland the white Rolls Royce slows
down to observe Swann pulling into the driveway Then stops
turns around and begins the trip back downhill We HOLD on the
Rolls as it heads toward

THE CITY BELOW

Pinpoints of light by the thousands articulating the grid of
streets avenues boulevards And here and there the white
gleam of headlights the green of traffic lights the red of
tail lights In Century City and in downtown LA buildings
still aglow gleaming with nocturnal activity

EXT FIRST STREET —- LATE NIGHT

Little Tokyo on the edge of downtown LAs business district
One- and two-story shops bars restaurant nestled among the
skyscrapers A multicolored neon sign sputters and buzzes
flashing out CAFE KARAOKE in English and Japanese

The white Rolls Royce glides to a stop in front of the Café
Its a 1967 Silver Shadow the vanity plate of which reads

ME IN MY

We hear--filtered echoic from inside the Café--the sounds of a
Japanese girl group singing Burt Bacharach

The DRIVER liveried in black quits the car He holds in his
hand an oversized ceremonial ENVELOPE addressed in
copperplate script to Monsieur Juve

-which he slides under the Café door
INT CAFE KARAOKE - EVENING

A small Japanese restaurant with a large projection video screen
on the front wall Theres a

YOUNG MAN

in a Thrasher T-shirt is stacking chairs upside down on the
tables His name is Edouard Jean-Paul Juve but thats
misleading because by speech by affect hes just another
American kid named EDDIE

In the front of the room seated on the edge of the stage is
the cafés owner

THEOPHILE JUVE

Hes a man of about 65-- And though twenty-odd years ago
Eddie sprang from his loins the two could not be less alike
Juves toupee comes low over the forehead and the large floppy
shirt collar is worn outside the jacket He sports a thin black
moustache of the type that must have been quite the mode

Hes polishing the barware looks up to see
THE ENVELOPE WITH ITS RED SEAL
sliding under the door And turns white

JUVE
F-- F--
(beat)
F--

EDDIE
You okay

When Juve finally is able to speak its an accent so thickly
French it sounds almost Yiddish The voice is thickened by
years of absinthe and nicotine

JUVE
Fantomas I chased him across three
continents Make that four Always one step
behind Id arrive by carriage in time to
find-- The latest corpse

He walks to the door never taking his eyes off the white paper
the red wax

JUVE (contd)
Then I caught him red-handed in Paris the
rue de lEstrapade Monsieur le Ministre his
hacked body in a steamer trunk Headlines
(MORE)
JUVE (contd)
Juve apprehends Fant6émas My name first

Inspector Juve Big Promotion Deputy Chief
of the Department

ON EDDIE

as his father drifts into an all-too-familiar revery He
divides his attention between his work and a full-pint can of
Sapporo The Sapporo is winning

JUVE (contd)
Trial quick Jury unanimous A month
later they put the hood over the head of this
fiend March him to the guillotine The
guillotine blade comes down

He illustrates a quick loud CHOP of ashtray against bar that
captures Eddies attention

JUVE (contd)
They take off the hood and its
(beat)
Not him not him at all Its the magistrate
who pronounced sentence Whose head alas
could not be re-attached

As he touches the envelope

JUVE (contd)
Fant6mas gone The next day he robs the

Galleries Lafayette-- I was there I was--
Half a step behind Almost--

(beat)
Almost--

(beat)
The very next day he kills Lord Halifax Ina
room locked From the inside

Eddie takes another pull of beer and puts and glances up his
father

»-who TURNS his body adroitly to conceal the envelope from his
son

JUVE (contd)
I could never understand it Fant6mas
Mabuse Fu Manchu the men were fiends Still
the poets raised their glasses in tribute
Fant6mas And yet Picasso paints his
portrait top hat white tie black mask
Like some kind of-- Hero

THE ENVELOPE

in Juves small pudgy hands The flap is sealed in magnificent
red wax with the signet F stamped in intaglio
JUVE (contd)
Hero fuck Pablo goddam Picasso was lucky
and didnt even know it Lucky Fantémas
didnt kill him In his sleep

His eyes drift off to another land And when he speaks its
the voice of revery different in every respect from the
screaming weve just heard soft dreamy almost tender

JUVE (CONTD)
Fant6émas could it be you

Then

JUVE (contd)
Cmere

Eddie walks towards his father

Juve stuffs the envelope still unopened into his breast
pocket before his son can see

EDDIE
Pops-—
(beat)
You tired pops
(beat)

You want me to lock up

JUVE
In the Event In the Event that something
Should happen you understand

EDDIE
Nothings going to happen

JUVE
I made some introductions last week A
business deal Im going to get a finders
fee So In the Event--

EDDIE
Pops-—

Juve shoots his son a look which despite everything creates a
long moment of silence

JUVE

In the Event that something should--

(beat)
Happen

(beat)
I would like the proper burial With
ceremony As befits a Chief Inspector
retired
His head moves an inch and a half to the left to the right
JUVE (CONTD)

My only son You you son of a bitch

Whatevers left over you can keep
EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS - SUNSET
FOLLOWING a battered Citr6en DS-19 up Outpost toward Mulholland
The driver is Theophile Juve freshly barbered dressed in his
best blue double-breasted gabardine a ribbon in the buttonhole

You can almost smell the aftershave

Juve PULLS his car into the driveway of Swanns Neutra house

INT SWANNS HOUSE - LIBRARY - DUSK

Swann as Nora depicted him in his Pierre Chareau reading
chair lLeafing through a leatherbound letterpress book He
HEARS the sound of Juves car in the driveway

finds and inserts a bookmark

EXT SWANNS HOUSE - DUSK - JUVE

With as much dignity as he can muster rings the bell

Swann opens the door His eyes dart quickly about as if
checking for exits possible weapons-- But thats the work of a
moment and when that moment ends quick as it begun the two
just stare Taking each others measure

Then

SWANN
Inspector Juve

Juve nods

SWANN (CONTD)
Please come in

Juve speechless follows Swann inside

INT SWANNS HOUSE - DUSK - SWANN AND JUVE

The living room sparsely furnished in continental (Chareau
Frankl) moderne offers up a head-on view of the city and hills
below
SWANN
What may I offer you

Juve shakes his head

SWANN (CONTD)
(finally)
Have you come to arrest me

Juve just laughs bitterly

SWANN (CONTD)
(softly)
What then

From his inside breast pocket Juve extracts the envelope hands
it to Swann for his inspection

SWANN (CONTD)
Im having a whiskey May I fix you one

Juve says nothing but accepts the offered drink

SWANN (CONTD)
You are Monsieur a welcome guest in my
house But on my fullest honor I have never
seen this invitation before

Swann raises a glass The gesture is not reciprocated

JUVE
(regaining his speech)
F-Father in heaven

Swann sits slightly behind Juve in the manner of a
psychoanalyst

SWANN
Go on

JUVE
F-- F-- For thirty years

SWANN
You have seen me eight times since then But
you did not know it

Juve drains his drink gathering the courage to say the word he
almost cannot speak

JUVE
F-Fant6mas

SWANN
Charles Swann My friends call me Charley
Swann pours him a refill which Juve downs in one gulp

JUVE
This is not right

SWANN
You may recall my late wife Céline But you
have not met my daughter Shes outside now
and should be done with her work in an hour or
so

(beat)

I would be honored if you would stay for
dinner Should you join us I would ask one
courtesy only one My daughter She knows
nothing of my past

JUVE
(flatly)
You ruined my life

SWANN
You did your best to ruin mine as I recall

JUVE
(brightening)
I can only hope so

SWANN
Be that as it may The invitation you
received my dear Monsieur Juve was not of my
hand Someone wanted you to come here
Someone--is there any other reason-- Wanted
one of us dead

Juve takes this in

SWANN (contd)
One of us perhaps--

Swann offers Juve a cigar which Juve declines With precise
elegant motions Swann picks up a sterling knife and with a
small flourish nips the very tip of the Montecristo

SWANN (contd)
--or both of us

Swann lights up Looks reflectively out the window

HIS POV

There in the garden NORA an apparition in white Covered
head-to-toe Bent low as if gardening or studying something

close to the earth A floppy suit a loose white helmet what
one might wear out for a stroll on the moons of Saturn

SWANN

consumed in thought Hes contemplating the prospect of danger
of death Yet behind his eyes we can see something

come to life

EXT DESERT PASS WIND FARM - DUSK

Some 20 miles outside of Palm Springs a forest of high-tech
wind-driven generators each on its own steel tower There are
perhaps two hundred of them The wind is quite gentle now and
the blades as they turn lazily emit a smooth soothing whup
whup sound

The white Rolls Silver Shadow pulls off the highway drives
across an unpaved road to one of the nearer towers The DRIVER
gets out of the car gun in hand followed by two CAPTIVES both
Asian businessmen in suits and ties one young one somewhat
elderly The captives have been blindfolded their hands are
bound with black silken cord

Next comes LEMUEL HARDT a tough guy with a Harvard MBA And
finally the boss VICTOR HOLLYWOOD a vigorous man in his
sixties tanned fit pampered sporting a trim white beard He
is wearing white shorts a Lacoste shirt and a Rolex as big as
the Ritz

The Driver places the captives up against the cross-braced steel
tower The younger man GONDO KEN is visibly nervous the
older GONDO HIDEKI a model of detachment

Lem addresses the elder man

LEM
(Japanese subtitled)
Gondo-san Mr Hollywood wishes to give his
permission for you to remove your blindfold

HIDEKI
(in English)
Only if we both may do so

Lem looks at Hollywood who nods

LEM
(in English)
Your pleasure is our desire

The captives undo the blindfolds Hollywood paces back and
forth in front of them Abruptly he reaches into his pocket
and extracts a gleaming compact disc And begins to speak his
casual American accent betraying in the Ws and Ts just a touch
of the Continent
HOLLYWOOD
Do you know why a compact disc has sixty-five
minutes of play time Because Mr Akio
Morita of Sony decided it must have the
capacity to hold Bachs cello suites without
interruption

He hands the disc to Lem who inserts it in the Rolls

player

The cello suite number 6 D minor Pierre Fourniers rendition

haunting poignant elegiac

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
(over the music)
The technology of the compact disc was not
held in the tight fist of one Zaibatsu It
was licensed There is greater profit by
many orders of magnitude And glorious music
encircles the world

Hollywoods hands move in time with the music as if he were

conducting

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
No one owns the wind

We see close the tall eerily majestic machines

HOLLYWOOD (contd)

But these generators make electricity
bringing power--

(beat)
--at a profit--

(beat)
--to Palm Springs to Rancho Mirage
Jewels in the desert

A gesture from Hollywood and the Driver pointing with his gun

binds Ken to the tower with silvered gaffers tape

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
Now you Gondo-san are in possession of an
extraordinary technology The Novium chip is
if I may be so bold a device for which the
inventors are fully deserving of the Nobel
And if our business had a Nobel Ken and
yourself are fully deserving of it for
spiriting the chip from its inventors and
offering it to us

HIDEKI
Offering it for sale

Kens wrist and ankles are fastened one by one each with its
own gleaming chrome handcuff The Driver then slathers Kens

body with a gelatinous glop Its electroconductive the stuff
they use for EKGs in hospitals

HOLLYWOOD
I do not want to own it I want to borrow it
Reproduce it
(beat)
I would like your chip to find a place in
every personal computer every web browser--
In every household in the developed world

The Driver takes a sharp-bladed shovel from the trunk of the
Rolls and begins to dig a ditch a few feet from the tower

HIDEKI
If we might talk price

HOLLYWOOD
What I offer Gondo-san is an equitable
royalty structure with a real back-end
participation When we make money you make
money All you have to tell me

The Driver does not have to dig long He hits a length of
cable cuts it in two fastens the live end to the towers
metal superstructure with more tape more glop

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
is where youve hidden the chip

Hideki watching the Driver listening to Hollywood keeps his
face impassive

HOLLYWOOD (contd)

In this season the valley cools dramatically
just after sunset The drop in temperature
creates a low pressure zone and the winds
start to blow At thirty-five miles per hour
through the pass Enough for each of these
puppies-- To generate some eighteen thousand
volts of electricity

(beat)
Impressive-- Yes

Hollywood extracts a business card from his jacket pocket

In gorgeous raised-letter printing on crisp Bristol board it
reads quite simply

FANTOMAS
Hollywood stuffs the business card in Hidekis breast pocket

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
Id like an answer

Hideki stands tall motionless radiating dignity

HIDEKI

You need not wait for an answer

(beat)
It is immaterial to me whether you make the
worlds largest fortune or whether you drop
it down a sewerpipe I dont want to be your
partner I want-- All I want-- Is for you
to meet my price

(beat)
And since you are unwilling to do this I have
only one answer Which is

(beat)
-that you may fuck yourself

ON THE TOWER - KEN

immobilized beginning to shiver

KENS POV - THE WINDMILL FOREST

as the blades lazy rotation begins almost imperceptibly to
quicken The rise in pitch of the fans can be heard now over
the plaintive solo cello

TIGHTER ON KEN

as he feels the first trembling effects of the electricity We
hear a single piercing scream

KEN
Father

Hideki keeps his eyes straight ahead

HOLLYWOOD
Youre a man of honor Gondo-san I will not
insult you by asking you to change your mind

Hollywood reaches into his jacket and comes out holding a 25
calibre Beretta It is whats known in professional circles
as a ladies gun and its what James Bond used before he
traded up to a Walther

Hollywood looks at Hideki imploringly Hideki is completely
motionless almost tranquil

Ken twitching uncontrollably watches as Hollywood takes aim at
his father

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
Im sorry we couldnt do business

The Bach suite builds to a crescendo The cello is truly
angelic And over the music the sound of a single SHOT

Hideki goes slack falls to the ground Immediately the desert
sand begins to lick at his now-lifeless body

The music is quieter now and we can hear the whine of two
hundred wind-driven generators the whistle of their blades

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
(to Ken)
Last chance Wheres the chip

Ken stares defiantly his face aglow with pre-sunset roseate
light He says nothing

Lem comes very close

LEM
Now or never

Kens facial muscles are in spasm But he summons up enough
control to spit hitting Lem smack in the face

With the calm befitting a Harvard MBA Lem wipes himself clean
As he tidies up Lem begins to whistle with extraordinary
derision along with the music

Lem without missing a note gives Ken a small wave of farewell
Then as Lem holds the door Hollywood climbs into his Rolls

FULL ON KEN ON THE TOWER
as the Rolls glides away back toward Los Angeles
VARIOUS ANGLES - THE ROLLS

climbing the notch between two barren hills The wind now is
beginning to howl

THE WIND-DRIVEN GENERATOR

spinning rapidly

ON GONDO KEN

his hair standing on end sparks flying from his wrists
performing some extraordinary acts of contortion until he can
just about--but not quite--reach the power line

The sun now is almost fully down and against the amazing
pinks and magentas of the desert sunset we can see the

generators spinning ever more rapidly And hear their whup whup
sound rising in pitch

Amazingly Ken manages to reach with his feet the power cable
On the third try he pulls it away from the tower grounding it
safely away from himself

Hair on end wrists charred extracts a yellow map pin from the
notch of his lapel--the insignia if it matters of membership
in Mensa--and goes to work picking the locks

In the very last light the locks spring and a weakened Ken
crawls across the desert floor to the body of his slain father
He manages to extract from his fathers breast pocket the
business card which Hollywood had placed there

Racked by sobs shock exhaustion Ken clutches the card as he
collapses across the lifeless body of his father

FANTOMAS

There is a neat 25 calibre bullet hole through the center of
the 0 And a red stain spreading outward from the center

The sun SETS We watch an ANT

Then another Then a third Then-- A column of ants crawling
up the sticky trail of blood up the back of the calling card

-and OUT the bloody HOLE

From ANTS to

EXT SWANN HOUSE - DUSK
--SPIDERS

A dense thick swarm So many in fact that it takes quite a
few moments to realize that this writhing palette is composed of
hundreds of individually sentient creatures

Peering over the horizon of arachnids we see a flap of WHITE
Which as we PULL BACK we now see as

The floppy white suit the loose white helmet Through the
woven mesh we see a pair of EYES Belonging to NORA

What Nora sees

An excited WOLF SPIDER making circles around the Queen in the
webs center He crawls first to the right then to the left
He raises his front legs in a small tremulous dance Another
spider crawls up interrupting The first spider STINGS him

NORA

makes notations on a pad of finely ruled graph paper The pen
is a blue Waterman with medium oblique nib We see her write
and hear her voice in accompaniment

NORA (VO)

The wolf spider lives alone works alone But
not really Like most arachnids he has an
alarm pheromone When he stings his enemy he
releases a scent which tells other male wolf
spiders--

HER POV

The queen spider in the center of her web Watching without
affect as a tangled CLOT of spiders converge on the victim

NORA (contd) (VO) (contd)
--to join in the attack

From the QUEEN SPIDER to

INT SWANN HOUSE - EVENING

-a QUEEN among a cluster of other pieces at the center of a
chessboard

SWANN AND JUVE

across the table Swann is waiting for Juve to move Finally
Juve fingers his rook

JUVE (CONTD)
Frenchman says “Beecauze someone he ask me
to be a polar bear at a funeral but eef zees

He laughs at his own joke Swann is not amused

SWANN
You interpose the rook I check you retreat
to Knight Three I check with the pawn mate

A foolish mate

The sound of a key in the door

WOMANS VOICE (VO)
Hello

Its NORA SWANN Charless daughter his only child Still
dressed is the white entomologists suit

Juve stares at this pale apparition

JUVE
(to himself)
Polar bear

SWANN
(ignoring them)
What you could have done back here was
bishop takes knight I block with the pawn

A more honorable mate

Nora removes her helmet shakes out her hair But still Swann
does not look up Finally

SWANN (CONTD)
May I present my daughter Doctor Nora Swann
Nora Monsieur Theophile Juve Dinner was an
hour ago Im glad I did not wait

NORA
Im sorry

Juve stands kisses her hand doing his best to be courtly And
discreetly brushes the dandruff from the shoulders of his
gabardine suit jacket

JUVE
You are the image of your mother

SWANN
(interrupting)
I saved you some of the gigot If you want to
come home late that is your own business but
tell me first

She looks at her father then looks away

NORA
Of course
(to Juve)
You knew my mother

Before Juve can respond Swann swiftly adroitly interposes his
body
Nora

SWANN

For th

SWANN
(whispering)
e past twenty years Monsieur Juve--

since Célines accident--I have devoted my
life to doing exactly nothing I like it that

way

I have known what it is to lose a wife

I do not ever want to know what it is like to

lose a

daughter If you can accept that we

will not have any problems If you bring

troubl

as certainly as the sun each night slips
into the Pacific And with about as much

noise

Juve reflects

Finally

We hear from the kitchen the clatter of

JUVE

Call me Theo

As Nora returns carrying a plate of lamb and vegetables Swann
resumes moving the chessmen His speed is blinding

SWANN
You had an even better option Back here
Decline the knight Instead pawn to bishops
pawn three opening up the diagonal

NORA
(to Juve)
My mother How-- How did you know her

JUVE
(guarded)
Not as well as I would have wished--

NORA
(to Juve)
Here or in France

JUVE
In France Well before you were born

NORA
What was she like

JUVE
In a word radiant I knew your father--
through business rather than socially so I
regret not having had the opportunity to make
your mothers fuller acquaintance

SWANN
(ignoring them)
I bring my other knight out we exchange you
deploy the bishop

JUVE
He cherished her And was very-- protective

NORA
I dont doubt

SWANN
(still moving the pieces)
Ultimately I still win of course But your
loss would not have been without its dignity
I would term that--

Casually Nora reaches for the envelope with the red wax seal
With his left hand Swann grabs the envelope before she can get
to it and with his right brings his queen down on the board
with a solid thump

SWANN (contd)
--a tragic mate

Swanns face is turned toward Juve but his eyes are looking at
something--or someone--far more distant We hold on

NORA

as she contemplates her father Wondering--not for the first
time--just what her mother was like and what she must have
meant to him

EXT MALIBU MANSION - DAY - TO ESTABLISH

Mr Hollywoods home and headquarters A stately pleasure dome
complete with large minaret and four flanking onion towers
which Hollywood picked up for a dime on the dollar from an heir
to the peacock throne who found himself having to leave the
country on short notice

The security--from fierce coiled concertina wire to an
elaborate electronic surveillance system--is very serious

EXT REAR LAWN - DAY - VICTOR HOLLYWOOD AND LEMUEL HARDT

Smack in the center Vic Hollywood and Lem Hardt in adjacent
deck chairs The mansion is a hundred yards behind them and the
ocean cliffs a hundred yards in front The only other object in
view is a large curved piece of Cor-Ten steel--a Richard Serra
sculpture--off to one side

Hollywood has white zinc sunblock on his nose and various other
spots on his face Lem sips from a bottle of Vichy water
Hollywood is reading from a leatherbound copy of Machiavellis
The Prince In the space between the two deck chairs are a pair
of cell phones one for each

In the distance the seemingly endless expanse of the Pacific
Ocean We can hear the soothing crash of waves on the cliffs
below and the occasional cry of an ocean gull

Now Hollywood is speaking on the phone

HOLLYWOOD

Machiavelli speaks of the lion and the fox
The lion is the man of action the fox the man

LEM
He says to me Shall I call every hour sir
Fucking sycophant

of the fox cleverness games stratagems
But to Machiavelli the prince is a man of
virtue The fox and the lion

Lem waits him out

death has come close to dying himself His
next three moves

Hollywood counts on his fingers

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
To find a woman To avenge his fathers
death To make sure the chip--the family
jewel so to speak--is in a safe place
Libido phallic aggression castration
anxiety in that order

An bottle-blonde WOMAN in the Pamela Anderson mode walks with
small steps towards them She is carrying a folding massage
table and a mesh sack full of various unguents

LEM
We keep watch on the woman on Fant6mas He
visits one then the other We follow He
leads us straight to the chip

HOLLYWOOD
Too much fox not enough lion

Hollywood pulls a face

HOLLYWOOD (contd)

turned Will you track that down for me

Lem makes a note
LEM

yards away

LEM
Does he know about his wife

ON HOLLYWOOD

HOLLYWOOD

Hollywood coughs--a dry hacking cough he cant seem to get rid
of The Masseuse sets up her table Hollywood stands up slips
out of his shorts and lies down upon it belly up The
Masseuse rubs oil into her palms and starts to work

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)

1967 The place surrounded by a dozen of my
finest And yet--

Swann says nothing

JUVE (CONTD)
Okay okay

Juve holds his tongue for a few moments And then cannot
restrain himself

JUVE (contd)
Of all your deeds Theres one I could never--
Figure out

Swann lifts one eyebrow

JUVE (CONTD)
Lord Halifax

SWANN
Surely Monsieur Juve you dont expect me to--

JUVE
The windows locked The door locked From
the inside

SWANN
(teasingly)
It is a classic problem

Swann bends down picks up a pair of mushrooms
SWANN (CONTD)
Amanita muscaria Amanita
phalloides The one is instant death The
other sautéed in a little butter is sex ona
plate
TIGHT ON THE MUSHROOMS
Almost identical
EDDIE AND NORA
some steps behind They walk along in silence On the face of
it theyre an unlikely match Nora in a Lacoste shirt

chinos and topsiders hair pulled back Eddie in a Pizzicato
5 T-shirt

The silence becomes quite awkward Finally

EDDIE
Couches

NORA
Excuse me

EDDIE

Couches I bought couches From the
Salvation Army

(beat)
Do you know what happens when you buy couches

She says nothing

EDDIE (contd)

It gives you a license

(beat)
You put the couches the older the better in
an old storefront Then you buy an espresso
machine You need a cook to open a
restaurant but anyone with a right arm can
make espresso So the couches give you a
license

(beat)
To charge a dollar fifty for a thimble full
of dirty water
A beat Then

NORA
Oh

EDDIE
We were artists Going into wild parts of
town Living in factories that no one else
wanted We wanted places where people could
sit and talk and argue and fall in love--
And never never sleep

NORA
Did it work

EDDIE
No

His smile is more disarming than shed counted on

EDDIE (contd)
We thought we were making a revolution What
we were doing was-- Making the world safe
for Starbucks

She looks at him

EDDIE (contd)
You know what an artist is An artist is just
the person who goes there first The person
who civilizes

He takes a branch uses it as a walking stick

EDDIE (contd)
An artist is to a real estate developer--
(beat)
What a missionary is to a slave trader

He flashes what he thinks of as his best smile

EDDIE (contd)
Thats why I dont make art anymore

Now without foreshadowing he slings his jacket over his
shoulder and begins to dance and sing

EDDIE (contd)
When I fall in love It will be forever
(Then )
Im sorry

NORA
No need to apologize

A beat

EDDIE
I cant really sing

NORA
Its okay

EDDIE
Its just that sometimes I have emotions to
large for words to contain

Then

NORA
I see that

They walk for several steps Then

NORA (CONTD)
There was a man once He was a journalist
Doing a piece for one of the womens
magazines What We Can Learn from the Birds
and the Bees Looking for an entomologist
Went to UCLA Found me-- Then the light bulb
went on over his head

EDDIE
Light bulb

NORA
Killer Bee Honey Hed put up the money Id
put up the expertise A partnership He
thought it would be the next Pet Rock The
next-- Tamagotchi

EDDIE
What happened

NORA
He got stung
EDDIE
I wouldnt want to get stung Or--
(beat)
Bit
(beat)
But I would like--
(beat)
To see you
NORA

You are seeing me

EDDIE
No no-- Like--
Nora studies this strange young man

NORA
Like you and me and the spiders

EDDIE
You and me and your spiders and my guitars and
maybe my surfboard

NORA
And maybe my bear

EDDIE
And maybe your bear Real bear

NORA

Stuffed bear Im still a child you know
EDDIE

Ah
NORA

Tell you what Why dont you ask my father if
you can go out with me Well give him twenty
four hours--

ON EDDIE
taking this in

NORA (contd)
--and if youre still alive well talk

SWANN AND JUVE
pausing now and then to add mushrooms to Swanns basket

JUVE
When you--comment dit on--disposed of Lord
Halifax The body was still warm You
couldnt have gotten out of the room And you
werent still in it How in Gods good name--

SWANN
That life is over for me When Céline died
When I had a daughter to raise A daughter
innocent of my evil

JUVE
If you wont tell me how at least tell me
why Damn it I mean what did Lord Halifax
ever do to you

Swann as if recalling a cherished memory permits himself
smile

SWANN
Nothing

INT HOTEL MONDRIAN —- DUSK

Gondo Ken and a beautiful Asian woman named EMORETTA on the
large bed in the very best suite in the trendiest hotel in town
Outside the window is the glittering cityscape which on nights
like this extends all the way to the sea

Their thin supple bodies moist with exertion gasp and writhe
beneath the huge Keith Haring print--encased in Plexiglas--which
looms over their bed

INT SWANNS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK - SWANN AND JUVE

Swann is sautéing a bunch of mushrooms in a copper pan Hes
humming to himself Juve looking on takes frequent gulps from
a large glass of cabernet

SWANN
(almost inaudibly)
across Paris and across the world Could
it be you

JUVE
Its the song The Fant6mas song

SWANN
I forget the words

Juve proud of his memory swells his chest and sings ina
strong baritone

JUVE
Stretching his immense shadow across Paris
and across the world who is this grey-eyed
spectre rising from the mist Fant6mas
could it be you lurking among the rooftops

Swann one hand on the frying pan one hand on the shoulder of
his lifelong nemesis joins in on the last line Abruptly Juve
freezes

JUVE (CONTD)

(almost to himself)
At the prefecture They used to hum that song
when my back was turned To mock me In my
favorite bistro The lyrics scraped into the
paint eye level above the pissoir I told
le Patron to do something about this wall
His reply The work of Monsieur Picasso is
not for sale

SWANN
A squeeze of lemon a dash of cognac and
never never overcook

JUVE
(suddenly)
I like you

Astonished by what hes just heard himself say Juve stops

JUVE (contd)
Why did you become Fant6mas

SWANN
Why did you become a cop

Swann continues to chop to pour to sauté

SWANN (contd)
I was very young Dien Bien Phu Saw more
killing than a seventeen-year-old knows what
to do with And then a door opened in front
of me I could go through it Or home
college suburbs wagon ulcer favorite chair
at the club cigar ashes dribbling down the
vest of my three-piece suit

Juve very quiet not having expected the intimacy
SWANN (contd)
Right or wrong Maybe wrong But I went
through that door and I never looked back

Swann gestures toward the table

SWANN (contd)
Sit The first of us will await the other

ON JUVE
Whos spent half his life tracking the man

-with whom hes about to dine

INT SWANN DINING ROOM - DUSK

Eddie and Nora are already seated at the table nursing beer and
wine respectively Juve sits cautiously Then Swann enters
bearing a pan full of the best sautéed mushrooms anyone has ever
tasted

As they eat
NORA
I always worry Amanitas are so delicious
But one error one wrong identification--

EDDIE
Im in a discussion group On the net Its
called-- Alt dot urban dot disasters And

somebody posted about this guy he ate the
wrong mushrooms okay There goes the liver
right So they harvest a good liver Slit
him open out with bad in with the good--

And the next morning hes fine A little you
know yellow-- But fine

He takes a big swig of beer

EDDIE (contd)
No big deal

Oblivious to her reaction he goes on

EDDIE (contd)
Went out the very next night to celebrate--
(beat)
By eating blowfish

Swann brings the pan to the table

JUVE
(to Eddie)
Pops Dont get too drunk We have a bar to
open tonight

SWANN
May I propose a toast

He looks directly at Juve

SWANN (contd)
To those no longer among us

Glasses clink

NORA
Father
(beat)
Isnt that a little morbid

SWANN
On the contrary

Eddie consumes his portion in record time helps himself to

seconds

EDDIE
Anyway Mr Swann May I have your
daughters hand in marriage

Juve breaks into peals of laughter followed by Nora followed
by Eddie--

But not of course Swann-- To whom the matter is not funny
not funny at all

EXT SWANNS HOUSE - THE DRIVEWAY - DUSK

The duck-nose of Juves Citr6en DS-19 Lifting as the
Citr6ens pneumatic suspension kicks into gear

NORA (VO)

When the male of a web-building spider is
ready to mate he begins to wander If he
runs into the web of a female he can
recognize it as such by her odor

The car pulls away

EDDIES POV - THROUGH THE CAR WINDOW

as Swann Nora the Neutra house recede in the distance

NORA (contd) (VO) (contd)

He then plucks at the threads with a special
Morse code signal If the female is not
ready to mate her reaction is aggressive and
the male leaves

NORA

watches the car depart holding her gaze for a bit longer than
truly necessary A fact which does not escape the notice of

INT HOTEL MONDRIAN - AS BEFORE

Ken and Emoretta exhausted collapsed in a heap on top of each
other

NORA (VO)
--or signals back

Ken his body bruised from the ordeal in the desert coated with
sweat and funk slips on an immaculate white shirt And places
over it a shoulder holster of perfect black leather containing
a 9mm Heckler and Koch P-13 Squeezing the grip to feed the first
round into the chamber The metal is of course matte black
and matches his oversize suit jacket by Comme des Garcons

Emoretta stirs

EMORETTA
You mustnt leave
KEN
I must
EMORETTA

Then you must come back
He ties his shoes

EMORETTA (contd)
Where are you going

KEN
To visit a dead man

Emoretta looks at him

KEN (contd)
Hes dead He just doesnt know it yet

EMORETTA
What will you do when you come back

Ken practices his fast draw several times in front of the
mirror pausing each time to brush the hair back from his
forehead Alain Delon-style

KEN
Put my head between your legs until I can no
longer see The taste of you in my mouth
And just when we both think we cant bear any
more we go on Our sex obliterating the
world outside all of it until the dawn

And hes out the door Emoretta waits for his footsteps to
disappear and her silk-robed body silhouetted against the
outsized Haring print

reaches for the designer phone

EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT —- SWANN

in his gleaming black Lincoln driving rapidly toward downtown
Once again theres a song on the radio and once again Swann
joins in This time though the song is slow almost mournful

SWANN
(singing along)
Here as I sit in this antique café
thinking of you Notre Dame casts its long
lonely shadow The world is my oyster but
Im only a shell full of memories

EXT CAFE KARAOKE - NIGHT - SWANN

pulls to a stop beneath the buzzing neon which reflects its
harsh colors off the Lincolns well-polished fenders

INT CAFE KARAOKE - NIGHT

The joint is hopping In the audience suit-and-tie Japanese
executives a few grave teenage couples a handful of Anglos

At the front on the giant projection video screen is a soft-
core rock video two teenagers gazing with great languor at each
others semi-nude bodies The words to the song appear
bouncing-ball style on the bottom of the screen

In front of the screen a shy Asian BUSINESSWOMAN sings into a
microphone To her right Eddie plays with knobs and sliders
Hes mixing her live voice into the prerecorded rock video
backing track adding reverb adjusting EQ

The businesswoman sings the final chorus in a sweet thin voice
staring demurely downward into the monitorprompter The
teenage girl on the video screen naked from the waist up is
singing too

The audience listens politely There is a figure in dark suit
and dark glasses head down seated against the far wall

INT KARAOKE BACK ROOM - NIGHT - SWANN AND JUVE

at a small table Light is from an overhead bulb swinging in
small arcs above the table There is above their heads a
television monitor on which can be seen a view of the main room

JUVE
Charles I cant begin to tell you how glad I
am you could come

SWANN
Then dont

JUVE
Your presence honors my establishment

The flattery is out of character Swann just stares at him

JUVE (contd)
I need your help

SWANN
You said as much on the phone

Juve begins to sweat Calmly Swann extracts a roll of large
bills from his pocket begins peeling them off one by one But
Juve waves him away

ANGLE ON THE MONITOR

A view of the main room The Asian businesswoman finishes her
song The next singer is a man in a black suit-- Who looks
very familiar

Juve and Swann talking intently pay no attention to the
screen

JUVE
Theyre going to kill me Charles I--
(beat)
--I know it

INT KARAOKE MAIN ROOM - AS BEFORE

The man on stage is none other than Ken Doing a version of
Heartbreak Hotel A predictable montage of urban streets at
night playing behind him on the oversized projection screen

INT BACK ROOM - AS BEFORE

JUVE
I wanted a little money To retire on For
my old age Not that Im not old already Do
you know what it is to be my age and not have
money and not know how youre going to live

ON THE MONITOR
Ken continues to sing

SWANN
So you did something

JUVE
So I did something I introduced a Japanese
um businessman Used to come by the club
To someone whom like yourself Id been
pursuing for years The Japanese man had
something very small very cold which was
very hot The someone has a lot of money
and would know what to do with such a thing
Me I was to get the finders fee

ON THE MONITOR

Ken and an accomplice a hard guy named SHOEI guns drawn The
things which Ken is saying into the microphone are not song
lyrics but instructions to the audience They respond burying
their heads on the counters like nap time in kindergarten No
one peeks-- Especially not Eddie who covers his entire head
with a large cloth napkin

Swann looks at Juve gazes distractedly at the video monitor
And then in one smooth motion no hesitation smashes the
overhead light and pushes Juve to the floor covering the fat
mans body with his own just as

THE DOOR

splinters bullets ripping through the plywood shafts of bright
neon club light thrusting into the darkened back room

throws his shoulder at the door Shoei hangs back

INT BACK ROOM - ON SWANN
his faced pressed against Juves cheek

SWANN
I am too old for this shit

Ken breaks through Covered by Shoei he casts a quick look
around the room Not quick enough-- Because Swanns arm snakes
out grabs his ankle and down he goes

Swann and Ken grapple on the floor Swann is amazingly agile
but Ken is 35 years younger and does this sort of thing for a
living Juve piles in

Shoei afraid to shoot into the tumble of bodies Just behind
him the karaoke video continues to play young lovers staring
into each others eyes ideograms bouncing along the bottom of
the screen to a supple pop backbeat No vocal save the screams
of the audience peeking at the action

Swann Ken Juve roll into the main room a flail of limbs

Shoei backs up holding the room at bay while keeping his eye on

Swann and Juve

Swann rolls out toward the sushi counter grabs the chefs
knife Next thing we know the knife SAILS through the air

We see Shoeis gun hand pinioned to the wall
EDDIE

peeks briefly from beneath his napkin What he sees looks to
make him sick and he buries his head once more

Juve gives Ken a good knee to the groin grabs the Heckler and

Koch and runs to the stage The insipid video continues behind

him

JUVE
(into the microphone)
No problem no problem

His voice thickened with delay and reverb echoes comically
Ken groans doubled over on the floor Shoei has fainted
Swann makes for the door pausing only to shoot contemptuous
glances at both Eddie and Juve

JUVE (CONTD)
(much reverb)
Wait

Swann mimes dialing a telephone as in call me Much noise
and confusion as the shambled restaurant comes back to life
Eddie looks around and takes a long pull on a premium beer

EXT KARAOKE BAR —- NEAR DAWN —- SWANN

dusting himself off walking toward his car Juve bursts out
the door running clumsily He grabs Swanns arm

SWANN
(counting on his fingers)
One you set me up Two you did it badly
Three--

JUVE

When I got that note Which you say you
didnt send I could have turned it over to
the FBI-- Interpol--

(softly now)
I didnt

(beat)
You owe me one

SWANN
I just paid you

A streetsweeper drifts lazily up Alameda in the pre-dawn glow

JUVE
Charles I swear I didnt set you--

He stops mid-sentence Because blood is pouring out of his
mouth

He looks down And there just to the left of his sternum is
small bullethole

JUVE (CONTD)
(matter of fact)
Oh my god Im going to die

Swann puts an arm around Juve gently cradling the man who
hunted him for forty years

JUVE (CONTD)
(softly)
Halifax-- How

SWANN
I mailed him a note perfumed with amaryllis
The scent rubbed off on his hands I lowered
a black widow spider a fine silken cord down
the chimney It went for the amaryllis and
bit I hauled it back up gently--

Juve is smiling

SWANN (contd)
--so as not to break the thread

Juve pulls Swann close
JUVE
Mon ennemi-- Mon frére--
(beat)
Mon semblable

Swann puts a finger to Juves lips Hushes him

SWANN
The first of us will await the other

And just over Swanns shoulder Juve catches sight of the man
driving the streetsweeper Its Ken Juve

TUGS

Swanns arm

Swann turns to see the streetsweeper bearing down on them

With his last strength Juve throws himself in the path of the
sweeper giving Swann time to escape Which he does nimbly
turning the corner into a narrow alley

Even as he runs it registers on Swanns face that Juve has just
saved his life

Swann runs down the alley Its a cul-de-sac nothing but a
high bricked-up wall on the other end

The sweeper turns the corner-- And just fits Ken grins like a
maniac

Swann sees Juve at the mouth of the alleyway bloodied
staggering And just behind him the streetsweeper

SWANN (CONTD)
The buyer His name

Juve runs out of breath and falls face down into the muck and
cobblestone ground The streetsweeper its engines echoing
loudly in the walled-off space bears down on him slowly
implacably

THE STREETSWEEPER - VARIOUS ANGLES

The oversized wheels The blade-like wire brushes--one rotating
clockwise the other counterclock--gobbling everything in their
path Which right now means Inspector Juve retired

Starting with his shoes

Juve flashes Swann a desperate V with his outstretched right
arm-- The last of him to go

Ken stops the machine Silence

KENS POV - THE ALLEYWAY

No Swann

Ken moves with cat-like grace down the alleyway inspecting
the trash-bins the sealed-up windows tapping the mortar on the
back-wall bricks

Buildings on two sides A brick wall at the rear And the
massive streetsweeper sealing off the entrance There is no
way that Swann could have escaped

The streetsweeper backs out Kens deadpan nearly screens all

trace of his frustration We FOLLOW the streetsweeper as it
heads west on First Street away from the dawn

THE ALLEYWAY

No noise no movement no trace of life A few trash bins a
discarded automobile fender a drainpipe which casts a slim
shadow The shadow is perhaps three inches at its widest not
enough to hide an alleycat let alone a man

It is from this shadow that Swann emerges treading softly
toward daylight

FEATURING THE CLUB - THE BACK DOOR
open just a crack Where
EDDIE

hidden trembling peers out watching this man Charley Swann
materialize

from thin air And walk away
Eddie ventures into the alleyway And only now sees
THE BODY

of Juve In name in blood in other ways Eddie has spent his
life trying not to acknowledge-- His father

Eddie bends down low Presses his head into Juves chest
Listening for a heartbeat Listening for something

thats not there

EXT TEMPLE STREET - DAWN - THE LINCOLN CONVERTIBLE

heads home Swann passes the Western Exterminating building
neon rats blinking their way clockwise around the facade We
FOLLOW as Swann heads north toward the hills

This time there is no music on the radio no singalong just
silence as Swann realizes that like it or not his early
retirement has come to an abrupt end That he can no longer
continue as he has for the past 25 years the life hes been
living

Or perhaps he realizes now-- The life hes been pretending to
live
EXT SWANNS HOUSE - DAWN

as Swann pulls into the driveway lining his car up beside
Noras Volvo

INT NORAS BEDROOM - DAWN

The room is half a childs half an adults On the shelves
stuffed toys vie for space with hundreds of books most of them
on entomology

Swann bends down gently kisses her cheek Nora smiles a little
in her sleep Fussily Swann adjusts the covers on her bed
Then goes to the shelf retrieving an ancient stuffed bear
which he places in the bed with his daughter

INT SWANNS STUDY - DAWN

At the bookcase Swann pulls out a volume--the hardcover of
William Irishs The Night Has a Thousand Eyes--and reaches into
the empty space with his right hand The entire bookcase begins
to rotate 90 degrees opening into a small room beyond

INT HIDDEN ROOM - NIGHT —- SWANN

turns on a dim overhead bulb which casts melodramatic shadows
on the bare walls Theres a chair a simple table and a stand-
up steamer trunk Thats it

Swann sits down his head bowed hands clasped as if in prayer
And after a few extraordinarily silent moments speaks in a
low private tone

SWANN
Forgive me Céline

And then doubts resolved he moves swiftly toward the steamer
trunk blowing years of accumulated dust from the old-fashioned
padlock

ON THE LOCK

as Swann inserts the key

Swanns face is very solemn very still But his eyes betray
emotion now fear now the excitement of a small child on
Christmas morning

SWANNS POV - THE TRUNK

The lid swings open One by one Swann pulls the slide on the
trunks interior drawers

The top one contains an amazing array of jewels diamonds
emeralds rubies most of them in art deco settings

The second one contains newspaper clippings yellowed now some
in English some in French all bearing headlines which contain
the word FANTOMAS

The third contains a variety of well-machined brass tools some
of which appear to be lock picks some of which seem to be
grapples and pitons for climbing Some rope some pulleys some
optical devices with lenses and mirrors the purpose of which we
can only guess at

The fourth--somewhat larger--contains a dress suit boiled white
shirtfront cutaway tails black trousers silken top hat And

a slim black elegant mask of silk moiré covering the top of

the face two perfectly placed slits for the wearers eyes

Awash with poignance Swann fingers the mask hes not worn in
nearly a quarter-century Re-folds it with care And extracts
in one neat motion

THE RING

from the tailcoats breast pocket Its a large signet ring of
the type one uses for stamping ones marque in sealing wax

Its platinum surface gone slightly dull now the ring features

Swann takes a step to the side allowing the sunlight to hit

Eddie full in the face

Eddie covers his eyes Swann pushes him backwards the
newspaper-lined floor crackling loudly with each step
puts one foot behind Eddies ankle and with the tip of
finger sends Eddie sprawling

Last nights killing at the Café Karaoke may
have closed the book on a colorful chapter in
the history of crime

Swann grabs the dropcloth which covers Eddies desk With a
conjurers deft flick of the wrist Swann YANKS the dropcloth
free There is a great clatter-- But each and every one of the
objects on Eddies desk lands in place

SWANN
I could just as easily snap your neck

Eddie surveying the room is forced to agree

SWANN (CONTD)
What happened last night

EDDIE
You were there

Swann takes a can of beer pours it into the airvents on top of
the Macintosh Fumes arise from within as the thing shorts out

SWANN
Dont make me repeat myself

EDDIE
I dont know anything more than you know

SWANN
Nice stick

He picks up one of the surfboards hurls it through the nearly
finished painting

EDDIE
This kind of shits supposed to make me trust
you
(beat)
Juve was doing fine-- Until you sent him
that note
SWANN

I was doing quite well myself Until your Mr
Juve showed up on my doorstep

EDDIE
All he wanted was a decent burial

SWANN
And where was he going to get the money for
his decent burial

EDDIE
Hed made an introduction

SWANN
I know that

EDDIE
Between a Japanese guy with a hot piece of
silicon

SWANN
I know that

EDDIE

And some rich guy was going to buy it

SWANN
I know that

EDDIE
Thats all I know

SWANN
You think I am fucking around

All restraint lost Swann storms and hurls turning the rooms
into a complete shambles His rage is terrifying When nearly
everything in the room is broken he picks up the Fender
preparing to smash it Pete Townsend-style Something makes him
stop He puts the guitar down and backs Eddie up against the
wall

The two inches apart breathe into each others faces

SWANN (CONTD)
I am sorry But I could have been killed last
night I need some answers And now some--
Slacker-- Cant remember what he ate for
breakfast

Swann picks up the Fender telecaster once more examining it
carefully Its a classic

SWANN (CONTD)
What year

EDDIE
Sixty-two

SWANN
Nice

Swann places the guitar gently against the wall

Eddie looks at Swann a man who threatens to break necks but
who stops at damaging an old guitar

Hes impressed

Finally Eddie reaches into his pocket comes up with a piece of
paper Its a call slip from the karaoke bar

EDDIE
The first time he came ‘round the club to talk
to Juve he filled this out Gondo Ken The
song he requested was J-9

SWANN
What is that

EDDIE

Eddie points to the newspapers on the floor Smiles Attempts
a bravado he cant quite carry off

up in Han Dynasty style

INT THE DOCTORS RECEPTION AREA - DAY

The waiting room of a man known simply as The Doctor a
specialist in herbal remedies and from time to time other more
violent cures There are perhaps 15 Chinese--old and young men
and women mostly quite poor--waiting their turn

RECEPTIONIST
Do you have an appointment

SWANN
Tell him a man calling himself Mister Charles
Swann is here to see him Tell him that man
said it is urgent

Swann sits down leafs through an ancient copy of Argosy

Swann stands up enduring the stares of 15 pairs of eyes

INT THE DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY

Three walls are lined with jars and boxes of herbs and
medicaments labeled in a variety of foreign languages The
fourth wall looks out onto the Chinatown mall There is a
leather examination table and a desk

In contrast to the general clutter the massive teak desk is
absolutely bare with the sole exception of a clear glass
APOTHECARY JAR in which what seems to be a PICKLE floats in
formaldehyde

Behind the desk is a Chinese MAN with wrinkled skin and a wispy
white beard It would scarcely be possible to imagine anyone
older

SWANN
I am looking for a Japanese gentleman by the
name of Gondo Ken

The Doctor leans back in his chair

In my office we observe certain formalities
Beginning with Hello

Forgive me Hello Doctor It gives me great
pleasure to see you once more and I am
grateful that you could fit me in on such
short notice

tumblers and a brown glass bottle of something very old He
pours

So You are looking for the man who killed
Inspector Juve

SWANN
Word gets around

THE DOCTOR
I suppose you want to thank him for the favor

Swann permits himself a smile

THE DOCTOR (contd)
The man disposes of a particularly irksome
inspector Yet you act as if the inspector
were your friend and his assailant your
enemy Why Mr Swann The world has so many
inspectors

He lifts his glass

THE DOCTOR (CONTD)
And so few of us

SWANN
(toasting)
May there never be fewer

Swann takes a sip of the pungent cordial pulls a face The
Doctor gestures toward the window

THE DOCTOR
The Chinese were brought here to build the
railroad We were useful because we worked
hard and were fungible Do you know what
that means Mr Swann That one of us was the
same as any other When there were obstacles
in the course of the railroad most often they
would lower a basket with a Chinaman and
several sticks of dynamite If the dynamite
went off prematurely well the fine for
killing a Chinaman was fifty dollars

Swann realizes that The Doctor is leading up to something

THE DOCTOR (contd)
We settled in what is now downtown But there
was great racial feeling against us Many
were killed on the street for the simple
crime of being who we were We built
elaborate tunnels under what is now downtown
LA to hide from our pursuers

The Doctor points out the window

THE DOCTOR (contd)
This part of town this theme park Chinatown
was built after World War Two by real estate
speculators White speculators And yet we
moved here into this travesty because there
was no place else in town they would let us
live in peace

Swann sips his drink

THE DOCTOR (contd)

In the 1950s when the whites of Los Angeles
began to realize how much they hated the
blacks and the Hispanics they forgot to pay
such close attention to those with yellow
skin And so the Japanese so recently our
enemies were allowed to move into downtown
Little Tokyo Occupying the very land that
had been ours

(with great and terrible

derision )
Infiniti Lexus Miata

(beat)
Forgive me Mr Swann if I snort

Swann seems to sense with relief where all this is leading

THE DOCTOR (contd)
Normally Mr Swann the code would insist I
protect any soul brave enough to eliminate a
policeman But I cannot bring myself to care
one way or another what happens to this
Japanese gentleman this Gondo Ken Who is in
residence at the Hotel Mondrian room 313

SWANN
I do not know how to thank you

THE DOCTOR
It seems Mr Swann that I may live forever
So there will be time and time for you to
express your thanks Provided of course
that you are around to express them Which
you might be if you avoid acts of stupidity

SWANN
Is that a threat

THE DOCTOR
To avenge the death of a policeman is an act
of stupidity
(beat)
It is almost the definition of stupidity

Swann heads for the door whose frame has been built somewhat
low

SWANN
You would not happen to know who Gondo Ken has
been doing business with

The Doctor stares at the apothecary jar Its contents a long
thin object beyond recognition

THE DOCTOR
Patience Mr Swann Patience and irony For
a longer life

EXT HOTEL MONDRIAN - DAY

Several police cars an ambulance sirens blaring horns much
commotion in front of the hotels (very hip) entrance

In the center of the chaos the silk-robed body of Emoretta
Gondo Kens paramour splayed out at odd broken-doll angles in
the middle of the boulevard

Police CRIMINALISTS are marking with yellow paint the position
of her lifeless body The Coroners MEN lift her onto a
stretcher leaving a familiar outline white paint on black
asphalt reminiscent of nothing so much as the Keith Haring
print which loomed above the bed where she and Ken made love

caught in traffic As he turns the curve toward La Cienega the
traffic narrows into one lane and Swann is able to see why the
blocked-off area in front of the Mondrian

SWANN

Always one step behind

Swann pulls his car to the curb strides toward the hotel

He contemplates the painted white outline Watches as
Emorettas body is lifted into the ambulance And overhears the
Duty Officer speaking into his radio

INT HOTEL MONDRIAN - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY

The entrance to the best room in the house now cordoned off
with yellow crime scene tape Guarded by two buff COPS

Swann now sporting a thick moustache and horn-rimmed glasses
walks directly up to them without breaking stride

SWANN
(with immense authority)
Coming through

Swann gives his best dont-you-know-who-I-am stare

COP (CONTD)

In one seamless gesture Swann coughs raising his left hand to
his mouth As his right hand darts behind him to extract the
wallet of a cop striding down the corridor

Swann flips open the wallet presenting the gold badge as if it
had been in his hand all along

lanes of traffic pointing his car back downhill As he floors
the accelerator he steers with one hand using the other to
remove the false moustache

EXT WATTS TOWERS —- DUSK

Sam Rodias magnificent homemade monument Glittering spires
fashioned of smashed crockery pot shards bottlecaps small
mirrors all embedded in cement around an armature of rusted
structural steel

Swann some distance away by the abandoned railroad tracks
keeping a low profile Using an old comfortable pair of
binoculars he scans the towers patiently as if hes been
waiting a long time and is prepared to wait a lot longer

A solitary guard locks the gate locks the door to the shedlike
Towers Museum gets into an old battered Camaro

Now its just past sundown

Abruptly a black Honda Prelude SI with tinted windows black
bumpers black wheel skirts slides to a halt in front of the
entrance

Gondo Ken in a black karate outfit gets out of the Honda
scales the fence with a practiced ease disappears over the top
Within moments Ken is scaling Tower 2

Swann gets out of his Lincoln closes the door quietly
Swann looks at the fence deciding whether to duplicate Kens

agile leap Thinking the better of it he extracts a thin piece
of metal from his breast pocket and goes to work on the

padlock As he works the lock he glances up from moment to
moment at the Tower

SWANNS POV what seems to be Ken still atop the Tower

The lock spans open Swann carefully opens the gate-- Only to
find himself staring at a barechested Gondo Ken Staring in
fact down the barrel of the matte black Heckler and Koch

Looking up to the top of the tower he realizes that what hes
been looking at is Kens karate shirt flapping in the wind

Ken throws Swann a pair of handcuffs

KEN
A taste if you will of your own medicine
yes Fasten yourself to the tower please

Carefully Ken takes two steps forward cuffs Swanns other
wrist to the iron armature

KEN (CONTD)
My apologies I killed that smarmy Frenchman
when the person I should have killed is you
I should have done it years ago In fact if
my father had killed your parents before you
were born it would have spared the world a
great many tears

SWANN
I think you are making a mistake

KEN
Your men kill my father They leave me for
dead They throw my lover out the window
Theres a warrant out for my arrest and my
best Matsuda sport jacket is in a hotel room I
cant go back to Some kind of mistake I
dont think so

SWANN
I wish I had known I would have brought your
jacket

KEN

In the old days when a man behaved as you
had we would show him photographs of an
arousing nature And then when his penis was
erect jam a thin glass rod down the slit A
couple of blows with a hammer was sufficient
to shatter that glass rod into hundreds of
small painful fragments Of which the man
would be aware for the rest of his life
every time hed urinate Unless of course
he chose to end the agony by cutting off his
own cock

Swann listening

KEN (CONTD)
These are not the old days I will content
myself quite simply with your death And
with the pleasure that you will never get your
hands on the chip Mr Fant6mas

With his left hand Ken holds up a small object no larger than
a tie pin

SWANN
My name is Charles Swann The person you call
Fantomas retired twenty-five years ago I am
sorry about your father whom I never had the
pleasure of meeting and about your woman
friend But I had nothing to do with their
deaths nothing at all

With great contempt Ken flings at his feet the bloodstained
FANTOMAS business card with the 0 shot through

KEN
I had thought you were evil Now I see what
you really are Which is a coward

Squeezing the grips he cocks the automatic pumping a round
into the chamber

KEN (CONTD)
In the name of my father

Ken takes steady aim Swann gazes implacably into the face of
his assassin

We hear someone whistling the syncopated triplets of the main
theme Bachs Sixth Cello Suite A shot rings out A
ricochets nasty whine as a section of the Towers fragile
mosaic explodes into dust

Abruptly Ken falls to the ground dead-- As Swann stares in
amazement

Swann looks up to see Lem Hardt smoke wafting upward from the
muzzle of a CZ-75 Lem walks over to the felled body of Gondo
Ken and prizes from the lifeless left hand the small object

which cost the lives of Gondo Hideki Juve Emoretta now Ken

Taking his time Lem turns his gun toward Swann For the second
time in less than a minute Swann faces the end of the line

LEM
Look at it this way If I hadnt shown up
youd already be dead

Lem takes aim But before he can fire a figure backlit by the
headlights of a white Rolls Royce calls out to him

Hollywood walks over to the foot of the tower

Swann squinting finds the face tantalizingly familiar

watches as it turns away north leaving the ghetto And then
he gazes at his own manacled hands

He gazes at the damage to the tower where a section of the
crockery mosaic has been blown away by Lems hollow-point
bullet

And then Swann whos been holding his thin lockpick in his
mouth goes to work on the handcuffs

INT SWANNS KITCHEN - MORNING - SWANN

pouring water through a coffee filter full of freshly ground
beans We hear the sound of water running somewhere else in the
house Swann continues pouring with a gentle circular motion
quite rapt

Nora enters hair wet Swann takes a second bowl from the
shelf heats up some milk

SWANN
These were your mothers bowls She and her
father used to drink out of them every
morning on the Rue Mouffetard

Nora begins to read the newspaper

SWANN (contd)
It is a street with cobblestones a market
street very old in the fifth arrondissement
You should go there some day take a look

NORA
Its Monday You always said that the flannel
cakes at Mussos were at their best on

If something were to happen to you I would
never rest

an offer for another company this one called Infotech a
microchip manufacturing plant in Carson The photo features

We watch Swanns face as he recalls where he last saw that
particular gesture A few days back in a downtown alleyway
the final silent words of Theophile Juve

On the television monitor the anchorwoman is introducing a
story Last nights murder it seems With live coverage from
the Watts Towers

SWANN (contd)
Just worry about yourself

INT HIDDEN ROOM —- DAY - SWANN

Once again among his Fant6mas objects The opera cape The
cane The classic paraphernalia

We watch him finger the objects one by one as if each one held
its own special poignance

And then like a Samurai preparing for battle Swann takes up
the black moire silk mask He wraps it around his face for the
first time in 25 years It fits exactly the masks slits
coinciding perfectly with his steely eyes slightly moist now
gazing into the middle distance

On a high shelf the fragments of Célines broken bowl not
quite fitted together-- Something from another time
EXT VICTOR HOLLYWOODS ESTATE - MALIBU - NIGHT

iron has dead-center Hollywoods monogram a Bauhaus-style

Behind a topiary hedge is a very serious electrified fence
topped with concertina wire surveilled by video cameras We
see Swanns Lincoln convertible top down empty largely
concealed by the dense cliffside shrubbery A little further
along a small hole dug beneath the chain-link And just
beyond a bowing of the electrified wire just wide enough
for person to squeeze through

On the mansion one wall of which is being scaled by a just
visible figure All in black Fantémas mask wrapped tightly
around his face Swann moves from handhold to handhold slowly
upward His body is sixty-odd years old but as if the ring and
the mask granted him a special grace he moves without
hesitation

We begin to hear the sound of VOICES from inside the mansion

INT HOLLYWOODS BOARDROOM - NIGHT

The room from which Hollywood conducts his business One entire
wall is filled floor to ceiling with television monitors In
the middle of the room is a large circular desk of ebony and
rosewood equipped with built-in phones and terminals We begin
to get a sense of the reach of Hollywoods empire

Around the circumference three of Hollywoods most trusted
associates all eyes directed inward to the circles dead
center in which is a large red leather chair The dealers
spot At the moment occupied by Victor Hollywood in a nylon
jogging jacket terrycloth sweatbands around his wrists like
any Beverly Hills mogul working from home

On his right hand in the power spot and not by accident is LEM
HARDT To his left is a smarmy yes-man ELLIOT WEST Across
the table WARREN SIROTA chief wonk technical division

HOLLYWOOD
It would be possible in this situation to
get something for nothing To use the
weakness of others to our own clever
advantage That would be the way of the fox

Forgive me-- but we cant be the only people
wholl be manufacturing this thing

HOLLYWOOD
Just the first And the only ones to implant
within the CPU itself some rather special
features

One of the video monitors along the far wall is now displaying a
shot of the exterior of the mansion There is a slight
disturbance in the video picture barely discernible just at
the threshold of what we can perceive

feet-first through an upper-story window

We can hide a gigabyte of ROM--our ROM--
invisibly within

He begins to pace

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
It tells the CPU to use the sound card as a
microphone To monitors the static deflection
caused by light falling on the CRT In short
this chip transmits An eye and ear in every
office-- Some bedrooms too I would imagine

Obligatory laughter

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
We have a pilot program in place Weve put
the ROM in some five thousand television sets
mostly hotels Mr Sirota if you will--
Could you access number One one three one

The number clearly was not picked at random Because on the
video monitors we can see the picture (blurry) and hear the
sounds (quite clear) of a fat middle-aged man tied to a bed
being whipped by a young woman in a black lace bustier

HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
Each installation currently costs us eighteen
thousand dollars With the chip twenty-three
cents apiece At certain points a change in
quantity becomes a change in quality

INT HOLLYWOODS MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

Somewhat smaller than Dodger Stadium Clean white tile floor
to ceiling exercise machines sauna steam a sunken bathtub
you could do laps in Swann treads the tiles with an
extraordinarily light step making no noise whatsoever

Along the ceiling at various points are sound sensors part of
the alarm system-- Which one by one Swann plugs with silly
putty

On the wall is a framed Salvador Dali oil painting melting
watches in a surreal landscape encased in Plexiglas against
water damage

Swann notices a video camera in the corner trained directly on
the painting And turns on the shower hot full blast

INT BOARDROOM - AS BEFORE

BLURS TO GREY as the condensation from the shower mists up the
lens

INT THE BATHROOM —- AS BEFORE - SWANN

notices a thin beam of laser-light at eye level crossing the
room inches in front of the Dali Swann thinks for just a
moment then picks up a hand-mirror from the sink and a small
compact disc player from the bathtubs edge

Swanns elegant capable fingers locate the laser arm bend it
upward He places the CD player in front of the portrait
positioning it with supreme care With one confident flourish
Swann pulls the hand-mirror down into the alarm-beam at a 45°
angle

The electric eye at the end of the tiled wall is now receiving
not the alarm-beam but the laser-light from the CD bounced off
of the mirror

The Dali now unprotected Swann slides it upwards to reveal the
dial of a sunken wall safe

trained on the door

INT BATHROOM - AS BEFORE —- SWANN

working the safe We watch his fingers and the almost abstract
display of iron filings shifting this way and that

Swann is a model of composure He is staring at the safe as if
he could open it by the force of his gaze alone

Then as if in response the safe opens Inside A thick stack
of yellowing envelopes (love letters) bound in wine-red ribbon
An exquisite diamond and platinum necklace And a small black
chip--the Novium--the size and shape of a tie tack

Swann grabs the necklace

And changes posture entirely as if the air had been let out of
him One moment before he was a man of pride and elegance now
he seems old and defeated There is a tremble in his reach as
he takes the chip

With whats left of his energy Swann reaches up pulls the
putty from one of the hidden microphones Unties his silk
mask uses it to wipe the condensation from the monitor camera
And looks directly into the lens

all of them now carrying the same image Swann repeated and
repeated 24 pairs of eyes staring balefully down

We see him turn his back on the camera in a gesture of utter
contempt

walks away from the camera And then in one swift elegant

sweep grabs the electromagnet from the safe and clamps it to
the videocamera which has been monitoring him

Swann holds the chip in his palm contemplates then hands it
over Hollywood gives him the necklace

SWANN
I owe you nothing now

They look at each other

HOLLYWOOD
I miss her too

The remark is too much for Swann to bear All control gone he
leaps on Hollywood hands around the others neck

We have never seen Swann with so little restraint It is truly
frightening

SWANN
How did she die Dammit How did she die

Within moments the GUARDS have separated them

Hollywood stands there slightly bruised breathing heavily
suppressing his cough Swanns hair disheveled and his
impeccable starched white shirtfront is missing a stud

HOLLYWOOD
You tell me

Swann is frozen

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
You wouldnt let her go You wouldnt let her
live She was dying inside and you didnt
even see And when she made her choice--

The two men stare at each other for the longest while Proctor
George walks slowly up to Hollywood

Hollywood brushes the grass and dirt off his shoulder His face
is thin drawn Hes been triumphant in presenting the news to
his associate victorious against Swann-- But you wouldnt know
it from his face which registers no joy

Just a dry cough

as courtesy of Hollywood he walks back to his car Hes
limping slightly And his shoulders have a stoop weve not seen

but well beyond the means of someone such as

Nora takes a cube of sugar lifts it with delicate silver tongs
drops it carefully into her tea

Then I could stand it no more I went back
one day at closing time to--
(Choosing his word carefully )
Obtain the book And--

A Catholic mission in the old style From the adobe tower a

INT SAN JUAN BAUTISTA — DAY

An old-style Mission interior dark light streaming in through
stained-glass windows At the altar an aged priest FATHER
BARRAGAN is reading from a typed manuscript

In the audience--perhaps five people Among them Eddie ina

honorific given lightly And what did
Theophile Juve do with this lofty position
Did he accept the quotidian graft which in

BARRAGAN (contd)

that day was the daily bread of the
inspector Did he look the other way

He shakes his head balefully no

BARRAGAN (contd)
Instead he selflessly devoted his life to the
pursuit of those spidery criminals too
dangerous too evil for others to pursue The
insidious Fu Manchu The heinous Mabuse And
perhaps blackest of all Fant6émas

Nora dressed in black enters the church tentatively And
seats herself in the back row

BARRAGAN (contd)
Many times he came near to meting out the
justice these archcriminals so richly
deserved In 1961 he did what no other
policeman before or since has ever done he
apprehended Fant6émas That villains
subsequent escape--from the very neckrest of
the guillotine--in no way casts shadow upon
Theophile Juves unique achievement

Barragan takes a hasty gulp from a glass of water Eddie
looks back to see Nora

BARRAGAN (contd)
After his retirement from the Sitreté
Nationale Theophile Juve made his home in Los
Angeles where his generosity and sunny
disposition brightened the day of all those
with whom he came in contact Never one to
dwell on the past this man this father this

Eddie says nothing

One of the pallbearers a frail old man seems to stumble
Eddie taps him on the shoulder takes his place As he steps
aside we see that the frail old man is in fact THE DOCTOR

NORA (CONTD)
These priests are always so-- Florid

Eddie hands Barragan an envelope full of money Barragan hands
Eddie the typescript

EDDIE

The way I look at he-- He should get the kind
of speech he would have wanted

NORA

As he talks we notice the pallbearer directly in front of
Eddie

EDDIE (contd)
Theres a really great course out at Oxnard
One side is castles--

An old man with a fully white beard and a black flat-brimmed
hat which covers most of his face

We can see what Eddie cant that the pallbearer is Mr Charles
Swann

EXT GRAVESITE — DAY

By the side of the grave is Mr Victor Hollywood thin and pale
Hes surrounded by three bodyguards and a video crew As the
funeral cortege approaches Hollywood is making good eye contact
with the local news reporter

HOLLYWOOD
When I came to this town I did not know a
soul in California And thanks to the
kindness of ordinary citizens like Mister
Juve may he rest in peace I was able to
begin to do business When there was no
reason to give me the time of day Mister Juve
paid attention Today it would be just as
easy to stay home gaze at the Pacific But
he was there for me and now its my turn to
come through for him

The pallbearers approach As he catches sight of Hollywood
Swanns face beneath the false beard tightens with tension

The Doctor whispers in Swanns ear

THE DOCTOR
We have our rules about funerals Always
have You know that

Swann says nothing

THE DOCTOR (contd)
Besides it would be suicide

ON THE GRAVE

As they lower the casket into the ditch Father Barragan takes
another gulp from his flask recites his prayers in Latin
Hollywood bows his head Swann throws a small bouquet of red
roses on top of the casket which is quickly covered up with a
spadeful of dirt Soon nothing is visible of the remains of
Theophile Juve

Hollywood lingers with the news reporters

HOLLYWOOD
Hey Larry Heres one Frenchman walks into
a bar He says What eez eet ze polar

Swann hearing Hollywood misses a step

One by one the mourners walk off Except for Eddie and Nora
who walk off together

friend

SWANN

I can take care of myself just fine thank

THE DOCTOR
Can you Can you scale walls Do you speak
Japanese Would you know what to do with a
Novium chip were one to fall into you hands

SWANN
I can scale a wall

The Doctor stirs his tea

SWANN (contd)
And if the Novium were to fall into my hands
I would know what to do with it

THE DOCTOR
Which is

SWANN
I would enfold it within the petals of the
reddest rose I could find And I would take
that rose and place it with others of its
kind on the grave of the only man I have ever
been able to trust

THE DOCTOR
You mean police-man

The Doctor rises with the help of a bamboo cane He walks
swiftly towards the door

THE DOCTOR (contd)
In my office When you came to consult me I
gave you a warning about stupidity I give it
to you again A third warning is something I
would not give not even to my mother Not

talented intelligent gracious woman who ever
walked the face of the earth

riding shotgun The back of the pickup is filled with wire-mesh
grocery carts A bumper sticker reads

HOW AM I DRIVING

Ruben scans the sidewalks for bounty Seeing something he
slams on the brakes

With a great show of reluctance Eddie drags his tired ass out
of the cab He grabs a shopping cart thats sitting idly on the
sidewalk hoists it up into the back of the pickup gets back in
the cab

EDDIE
How come you always drive

RUBEN
Because its my truck How come you always so
lazy

Ruben stops the truck again waiting for Eddie to notice another
Ralphs cart It takes a while

RUBEN (CONTD)
You slow today dude

Ruben extends his arm magisterially to the cart Eddie seems bent
on ignoring Ruben stares him down Finally Eddie jumps out of
the cab and wrangles the cart

EDDIE

Ruben Can I borrow the truck tonight my
cars a little out of tune you know--

Ruben in the cab of the pickup has heard this before Many
times

RUBEN

Fucking white boys with their fucking muscle

The truck turns left on Las Palmas past a bunch of run-down
Hollywood bungalows There are some little kids playing in the

street They have captured a large spider put it in a zip-loc
sandwich bag Now they are performing a science experiment
attempting to fry the imprisoned spider with a magnifying glass

denims and a black Nine Inch Nails T-shirt Swann in his black

evening tailcoat
Eddie looks at his watch

EDDIE
I feel like an asshole

SWANN
Patience The most difficult art as my
friend The Doctor keeps reminding me But
hell show And when he does--

Swann hands Eddie a matte black automatic pistol

SWANN (CONTD)
You know how to use this

EDDIE
Of course

SWANN
Its a Heckler and Koch You squeeze the
handgrips to put the first round into the
chamber

EDDIE
Absolutely

SWANN
Its owner was the man I believe you met
briefly in the Café The one who sang
Heartbreak Hotel

EDDIE
Did you kill him

A beat Then

SWANN
He lived by the Yakuza code and was not
without honor Your obligation is to use his
handgun with respect

The sound of an approaching car Swann and Eddie stare down the
roadway and soon enough the white Rolls Silver Shadow pulls up
in front of the mission colonnade

The driver as Swann expected is Lem Hardt He is alone He
gets out of the car a shovel in his right hand and makes his
way to the cemetery

Swann waits until Lem starts to dig Then he and Eddie
approach Eddie trains the gun

SWANN (CONTD)
The handgun thats pointed at you belonged to
Gondo Ken Im sure that the bullet in the
chamber has your name on it

LEM
Let me get on the phone Im very liquid
One call to Geneva and you walk out of here
with a truly astonishing fortune

SWANN
Keep digging A couple feet to your left

LEM
You need an assistant Ditch the kid Im
ten times better than hell ever be I know
it and you know it
(gesturing towards Eddie)
He knows it

The look on Eddies face as he realizes that Lem is right on
all counts

SWANN
A little deeper please and more to the left
Juves grave is big enough for two But it
would hardly be right to ask him to share it
with you for the rest of eternity Hardly
right at all

LEM
You want to kill me Okay Kill me

A cruel smile plays across Swanns face And he begins to
whistle the theme from Bachs Sixth Cello Suite

Swanns rage--at Lem at Eddie at himself--cannot be contained
He grabs Eddie shoves him aside sending him brutally across
the stone floor Then grabs the rope pulling up and down
with all his weight

Swann is riding the rope now gripping for life face frozen in
a wild grimace

The bell rings A long wait Then a rhythmic clang louder
this time And then a dull sickening thud

the road frontage and they turn a curve to see sudden and
unexpected the nighttime city laid out before them

Swann driving Eddie in the passenger seat Spattered with
dirt and blood And nothing to say to each other

On impulse Swann punches the radio button The music comes up
loud and a vocalist is howling

VOICE

When theres no future how can there be sin
Were the flowers in your dustbin Were the
poison in your human machine Were the

With his eyes Swann follows the cigar smoke Up to the shelf
to the fragments of Célines bowl not quite repaired

SWANN (contd)

Eddie says nothing Finally

EDDIE
Now we sit here and-- Wait Tin ducks Tin
fucking amusement park ducks

Near my books Among my memories You are a

man who scales walls who likes rocknroll who kills people

has become so sullen so passive so-- Defeated

INT SECRET ROOM — DAY

As Swann stares off into space something seems to brighten
behind his eyes Slowly at first-- And then he smiles as if
hes made a decision

He gets up from the chair and rummaging through his drawers
gathers material

Singing to himself an expression of weird contentment on his
face Swann pours gasoline on the floors on the walls--

SWANN
(singing to himself)
Stretching his immense shadow across Paris
and across the world who is this grey-eyed
spectre rising from the mist Fant6mas
could it be you lurking among the rooftops

Pouring deftly from the wrist as if sautéing mushrooms

Whos Hollywood

EDDIE
Hollywood used to be Mabuse and Charley used
to be Fant6émas and Hollywood killed my father
and wants to kill your father and probably me
too-- And your father seems to have just
given up

At once Nora feels very far from home

NORA
We have to help him

Eddie thinks about this for a long time Finally he seems to
have made up his mind and he swings the truck around in an
abrupt screeching U-turn

They are on Woodrow Wilson heading back toward the Swann house
They head up a steep incline the hill just before the house

At once the sky seems a bright an unnatural orange A second
later they hear the roar of flames

Eddie slams on the brakes

He and Nora jump out of the truck scramble up to the top of the
incline

They see the house afire completely out of control

An explosion slams them back toward the truck

The explosion rocks the ground rocks the truck Its rear gate
pops open And one by one the forty Ralphs carts begin
making their way downhill

Eddie grabs one then another Nora piles in but there are just
two people and so many carts--

They stare helplessly at the explosion and reflexively--because
its the only thing they can do--grab for the carts As if it
would change anything

And then Eddie and Nora grab each other embrace hold

And eventually turn away from the flames still licking the sky
to the procession of carts making their noisy way down Lookout
Mountain Pass to the city below

EDDIE
Its going to be all right

He does not sound as if he believes what he is saying

They cling to each other and do not let go Both of Noras
arms are tightly around Eddie One hand grasps his shoulder
the other her stuffed bear

INT THE DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY - THE DOCTOR

is with a patient a thin Chinese man who is sitting shirt off
on the crunchy white paper of The Doctors old leather
examination table The Doctor holds a stethoscope to various
points on his chest

THE DOCTOR
(in Chinese)
Deep breath And out And in And out

A man with a shaven head and a powerful build wearing a striped
seamans jersey bursts through the door followed closely by
The Doctors Secretary

SECRETARY
(in Chinese)
I am sorry and ashamed I could not restrain
him

THE DOCTOR

(in Chinese)
In no sense is this your fault

(to the patient)
My deepest apologies for the interruption of
your examination If you would indulge me
while I attend to a matter of urgency I would
be eternally in your debt

The secretary and the patient leave The wrestler closes the
door behind him The Doctor sits behind his teak desk again
impressively bare save the mysterious apothecary jar

Though the disguise is a good one we can tell now that the
deckhand is none other than Charles Swann

THE DOCTOR (CONTD)
The last time you were in this room Did I
not say something about patience And when we
met in that cafeteria-- What did I say to you
then

SWANN
About the chip You my friend you betrayed
a confidence

THE DOCTOR
You meant me to
Swann realizes that The Doctor is once again absolutely
correct

SWANN
I have this problem doctor Ive been
walking around for twenty years with a
desperate need and I only just realized it
this morning

THE DOCTOR
I believe I warned you repeatedly about
stupidity I was stupid once It was in the
International Settlement of Shanghai when the
Japanese invaded and my stupidity caused me
to be captured

He lights his pipe

THE DOCTOR (contd)
They had way of dealing with enemies It
involved a mans private parts and a thin
glass rod--

Swann looks at him

THE DOCTOR (contd)
You are familiar then with the choices
presented to man upon whom this has been
practiced

Swann nods

THE DOCTOR (CONTD)
I have never been good about physical pain
Even with the opium it was not something I
could bear A week later in a basement in
the French Concession I surgically removed my
own penis

SWANN
I am genuinely sorry

THE DOCTOR
I have not missed it It is an amazing thing
what one can accomplish once one decides to
leave ones pain behind

He taps the apothecary jar The object within moves
fractionally floating within the formaldehyde

THE DOCTOR (contd)
I keep this here as a reminder of what has
been taken from me And what has not It has
become for me quite a source of inspiration

Swann tries not to stare at the jar

SWANN
Still Stupid or not I need your help And
your protection

The Doctor relights his pipe

INT THE SAHARAN MOTEL - AFTERNOON - EDDIE AND NORA

fully dressed on the bed of a tacky economy hotel room on the
ass end of Sunset Strip near La Brea

There is a television set in the corner its tube facing
directly toward the bed

EDDIE

NORA (CONTD)
Then

Eddie gets up from the bed and starts lining the floor with
sheets of crumpled newspaper

EDDIE
Tell me about your-- Spiders

NORA
Signals Webs Hieroglyphics really Where
the food is Where danger lurks Near far
Which direction
Eddie leans back They are almost touching

EDDIE

EDDIE (contd)

NORA
Im thinking that youre just as pigheaded as
my father

Eddie leans over

NORA (contd)

But--
(beat)

--maybe--

They kiss

NORA (contd)
Cuter

Slowly they begin to make love

Within moments

Noras clothes are off and Eddies clothes are off and they
slide against each other in a tangle of limbs bodies
intuitions Discovering each other-- Discovering parts of

themselves long kept secret

In their heat Eddie and Nora are so fully absorbed that they do
not hear--as we do--the opening of the door

-or the crunching of the newspaper

EDDIE TURNS HIS HEAD

to see Elliot West and three of Hollywoods security GOONS
Theyre pointing their silenced Czech automatics

WEST
Mister and Mrs Smith Original

Nora pulls a sheet over her body Eddie moves to protect her
WEST (contd)
Id bet you could not produce a marriage
license

The goons guffaw

EDDIE
You touch her and youre dead

More laughter
EDDIE (contd)

Leave her alone and Ill tell you where you
can find the chip

WEST
I dont do business with assholes
(to Nora)
Get dressed lady Youre coming home with
us
NORA

Could you-- turn your backs

WEST
Not a chance

Eddie CHARGES him One goon gives him a clout with the butt-end
of the pistol Like a maddened bull Eddie rises charges head
first at West Two of the goons knock him back to the ground
kicking him viciously in the kidneys and in the head

Nora looks on in horror

NORA

You dont have to do that
WEST

We dont have to We want to

(beat)
Put your clothes on

Beneath the sheet Nora wriggles into her clothes Eddie out
cold lies on the floor curled up into a ball His blood

stains the carpet One of the goons gives him another kick for
good measure

but Eddie does not respond

INT YEE MEE LOO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A nondescript downtown Chinese restaurant Formica tables
fluorescent lights A few diners all Chinese are eating rice
and sipping soup when BANG through the doors come three goons
West Hollywood three more goons All carrying Uzis

The goons charge through the restaurant through the kitchen
down a flight of stairs into the mens room The goons shove
against one of the stalls which opens revealing another down
staircase

We FOLLOW them down three flights along a dark narrow
corridor Down a steep spiral staircase Down into

INT UNDERGROUND CITY - NIGHT - VARIOUS ANGLES

The subterranean city built by Chinese immigrants at the turn of
the century Complete with stores restaurants housing All
along the sides of four-foot wide tunnels

With an abrupt snap one of the goons finds himself hanging
upside down from a hemp ankle noose They leave him there

There is a gunshot and another goon drops to the ground A
third goon fires at a dimly seen moving figure who drops from
his niche carved into the tunnelside It marks the beginning of
a full-scale gun battle between Hollywoods security goons and
the young Chinese who work for The Doctor

When the smoke clears The Doctors troops have been out-gunned
Hollywood West and the two remaining security goons stand
outside the large wooden door to the room where Swan is holed

up

HOLLYWOOD
Its over Charley Come on out

No reply

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
Ive got something I want to show you

Still no reply

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
A television show Starring your daughter

INT SWANNS HIDEOUT - NIGHT

The door opens slowly Theres Charles Swann still shaven-
headed in a rumpled white-tie formal suit in a room scarcely
larger than a prison cell There is a canvas cot a small
table one wooden chair a bare light bulb Thats it

Hollywood enters West and the goons remain outside

Hollywood places on the table a battery-powered 8mm VCR wired
to a color Watchman He switches on the tape

NORA
(on the videotape)
I dont want you to worry about me Im all
right--

SWANN
Thats enough

Hollywood turns it off

HOLLYWOOD
Do I get the chip

Swann reaches into the watch pocket of his white formal vest
pulls out the chip As he hands it over

SWANN
You have gotten what you came for Why dont
you kill me

HOLLYWOOD
Youre better than me Charles Always were
And I guess theres always been a hope-- The
Spiders You me The Doctor Its not too
late

SWANN

Fuck yourself

HOLLYWOOD
What happened Charles You used to be a
pretty evil dude

SWANN
Still am
HOLLYWOOD
Il faut plonger le monde dans un abime We

must plunge the world into an abyss of
terror Your words Remember Charles

Hollywood laughs The laughter becomes a spasm of coughs We
sense that Hollywood is quite ill

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
When times changed I changed with them
Youre still the anarchist running across the
rooftops

Swann says nothing

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
Youre sixty years old This town has no

rooftops
SWANN
Viktor Look at yourself Youre not evil
Youre just-- Corrupt
HOLLYWOOD
Why dont we say well-networked
SWANN
You used to know better Viktor
HOLLYWOOD
Why are you so afraid of-- The big time
SWANN

Thats not crime Thats organized crime
(with great disgust )

Work Business Civilization
(beat)

You know what civilization is
(beat)

War without all the noise

Hollywood just tosses the chip in his palm Up and down

HOLLYWOOD
Ill have Sirota check it out If its real
nothing will happen to your daughter

SWANN
I cannot believe that you would bring my
daughter into this Célines daughter

HOLLYWOOD
Its the real world Charles You cant
protect people from the real world

Hollywood stands up

SWANN
I worked for more than twenty years to keep
her away from this Now you have shown her
(MORE )

SWANN (contd)

things she should never have seen For that
alone you are dead

Hollywood opens the door He holds up the chip and his gunmen
smile

EXT SUNSET BOULEVARD - MORNING —- THE LINCOLN

sweeping lazily around the curves of Sunset out toward the
beach Its a bright sunny morning and theres no other
traffic

Swann still dressed in his rumpled cutaway is singing along
with a Bob Dylan song on the oldies station

VOICE
(on the radio)
--When you aint got nothin you got nothin
to lose Youre invisible now you got no
secrets To conceal How does it feel

In the back seat of the open-topped convertible are seventy
sticks of dynamite taped up fully wired

Swann is smiling

EXT PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY
Swann takes the turnoff for Hollywoods estate

With one hand he pulls the black silk moire mask over his head
aligning the slits with his eyes

He FLOORS the accelerator By the time he reaches the gate to
the estate hes doing ninety

He plows right into the gate which smashes open Immediately
the sirens start to wail Swann heading straight for the
house picking up speed pokes away the shards of shattered
windshield with his right hand

From one of the onion towers a security goon fully Bijand
out OPENS FIRE

THE WHITE ROLLS

with Hollywood at the wheel pulls out of the garage As the
black Lincoln heads for the house the white Rolls angles in
aiming to intercept

Swann realizes whos driving the Rolls and veers away from the
house directly towards his nemesis The black and white cars
approach each other at frightening speed

Hollywood executes a swift full-power U-turn forcing Swann to
circle coming once more within range of the tower gunman Just
when he seems directly in the line of fire Swann swerves behind
the massive sculpture and we hear the bullets ricocheting off
the thick sinuous steel

But as Swann emerges from behind the Serra slowing for the
turn his side is presented directly to the Rolls Hollywood
pulls out a pistol and takes careful aim

A SINGLE SHOT

from Hollywood another from the onion tower

We see Swanns head SNAP BACK His hands fall from the steering
wheel

The Lincoln uncontrolled accelerates mid-turn heading
straight for the Serra

Collides

There is a great explosion The sky is bright white then
orange then full of dark acrid smoke Pieces of the
automobile drift lazily downward as if in SLOW MOTION

forming a new sculpture--Serra meets John Chamberlain

-on the manicured lawn

EXT CREMATORIUM - FOREST LAWN - DAY
The simple Greek Revival building which houses the crematorium

NORA (VO)
Something he read to me Once A long time
ago The end of a story Edgar Allen Poe

Parked outside in the lot Eddies muscle car

NORA (contd) (VO) (contd)
I was in the crook of his arm it was bedtime
Usually I fell asleep there in the crook of
his arm before the storys end but this
night I stayed awake

INT FIRE ROOM
Eddie takes a piece of cloth and places it near the head of a
plain pine box Just before he closes the lid we catch a

glimpse torn frayed black moire silk

the mask of FANTOMAS

NORA (contd) (VO)
It was about a man whod done something bad
something very bad Now he was in jail
awaiting execution

The box on a conveyor belt heads toward the oven where two-
dozen butane flames are waiting to consume it

NORA (contd) (VO) (contd)
I still remember what he said in my fathers
voice
(beat)

Today I am in chains-- But here
Eddie holds Nora very close Eddie Nora Noras stuffed bear
silhouetted against the intense white light of the
crematorium

NORA (VO) (CONTD)
Tomorrow I shall be free--

»as the plain white pine box disappears

INT CREMATORIUM —- FOREST LAWN - DUSK

The harsh late-afternoon sun A thin tendril of smoke wafting
straight up in the still windless air

NORA (contd) (VO)
But-- Where

Eddie Nora holding each other looking out
The freeway its traffic the valley the mountains

the darkening world beyond

INT EDDIES PLACE - DAY

Sunday morning sunlight streaming in through the windows

The place looks neater and cleaner than weve seen it The

surfboards the computers all in the back now In the front

an easel a stretched canvas Nora is curled up in a large

chair while Eddie primes the canvas singing softly to himself
EDDIE

The eensy weensy spider crawls up the water spout

Now Eddie notices something out of the corner of his eye An

envelope white protruding almost beckoning just beneath the
door

A white envelope with a red wax seal

EDDIE (CONTD)
Oh my god

NORA
What is it

Eddie takes a few light steps carefully hiding the envelope
from view with his foot

EDDIE
Nothing

EXT MILLION DOLLAR THEATER —- DAY

Eddies battered muscle car parked outside of a boarded-up
moviehouse downtown LA

INT MILLION DOLLAR THEATER —- DAY

A once-magnificent moviehouse now shut down The ornate
ceilings and proscenium surround an auditorium of worn faded
velvet seats

We FOLLOW Eddy across the empty stage in front of the screen
At once he is silhouetted by a shaft of light from the
projectionists booth

VOICE
Up here

Eddie squints into the light There is a metal cable dangling
from the booth

He grabs the cable and starts upward The cable is slippery
hes not used to this kind of activity For every three feet up
he slips back two

INT PROJECTIONISTS BOOTH - DAY - SWANN

in black reading an old almanac Its a bare room--one cot
one chair--of the type Swann seems to favor The room is lined
with 35mm film reels and spare projector parts

Eddie--sweating breathless--clambers through the rectangular
opening

SWANN
(without looking up)
We have work to do

INT HOLLYWOODS OFFICE - DAY

A fireplace An oversized bureaucrats desk from the British
Raj A couple of comfy chairs done up in well-worn red
leather Nothing high-tech at all in fact nothing twentieth
century except for a telephone and a modest television monitor
built into the rolltop taboret

Hollywood behind the desk emaciated just flesh and bones now
Idly flicking the television remote

Image after image of bedrooms living rooms Mostly blurry
Mostly of families zombied out staring directly at the tube

HUSBAND
(on the screen)
Honey have you seen the orange juice

Hollywood changes the channel Two men in a business
discussion Click A couple fucking Click He flicks again
and again looking for something to hold his interest

There is no intimacy which Hollywood cannot access More than
anything he seems painfully bored

Hollywood clears his throat punching up another bedroom And
tried quite hard to avoid another coughing fit

INT MILLION DOLLAR THEATER PROJECTIONISTS BOOTH - NIGHT

There is a floor plan of Hollywoods mansion projected on the
screen Swann gestures with his pointer narrates

SWANN
This is office Locked door locked windows
According to The Doctor nobody enters nobody
leaves Once a day West brings the mail ona
tray Thats it

EDDIE
So how to we get in

SWANN
We dont

EDDIE
Good Lets go home

SWANN

He leans back As if about to settle in for a bedtime story

SWANN (contd)
-about Lord Halifax

EXT HOLLYWOOD ESTATE - NIGHT

The dark looming castle behind the iron gate Again the

H

logo dead-center But now the gate has been repaired
augmented with welded steel cross-bracings and a machine gun
nest behind an embankment of sandbags lies just beyond

INT HOLLYWOOD MANSION - NIGHT

Security goons patrol the corridors There are far more of them
than weve seen before A trio of them stand at dress attention
outside the door to Hollywoods office

INT HOLLYWOODS OFFICE - NIGHT

Hollywood propped up in his chair behind the colonial desk
Still flicking the television remote but too listless now to
pay attention There is a knock on the door Elliot West

arrives with a sterling tray of mail places it on the desk

WEST
Everything okay sir

Hollywood makes no reply Doesnt even notice when West leaves
Numbed by the television but unable to stop watching Hollywood
distractedly opens envelope after envelope considers the

contents tosses Then stops

An envelope with a blood-red seal An intagliod

F

Slowly Hollywood tears the flap The card is written in
impeccable Copperplate

stamped deeply into the wax

For Céline
for Juve
for everyone on television

Hollywood is toying with the card when his nose starts to
twitch Abruptly he leaps up

HOLLYWOOD
Amaryllis

Then sits down again A smiles flickers across his face grows
For the first time in a long while Hollywood seems--At peace

Glancing toward the fireplace with Zen-like calm Hollywood
awaits the arrival of a black widow spider

EXT HOLLYWOODS MANSION - NIGHT

A FIGURE--black jeans black shirt black hood--perched atop one
of Hollywoods minarets Holding a large black metal box And
now dumping its contents down the chimney

INT HOLLYWOODS OFFICE - NIGHT

Spiders tumbling down the chimney out the fireplace Not one
elegant spider on a silken cord but hundreds of spiders
thousands of SPIDERS crawling across the floor up the
wainscoting all deadly And like all black widows with the
congenital reflex that responds to the odor of amaryllis

Hollywood starts to cough

There is a spider crawling up his tweedy leg He tries to stay
motionless but at the last moment gets the willies and crushes
it

Another spider attaches itself to his jacket

We watch Hollywood trying with all his might to stay put in
the chair Then screaming like a terrified child he can take
it no more and runs full-tilt for the door

INT MANSION CORRIDORS —- NIGHT

Hollywood bursts through the door scattering West and several
goons As he runs down the hall they try to follow

HOLLYWOOD
Get back Get back My office Spiders
Kill them kill them all

He turns a corner runs down another corridor past several more
guards through his bedroom into his bathroom Inspects
himself for bugs Locks the door frantically all three locks
Turns on the shower hot
Hollywood scrubbing himself down with brown soap Pausing to
sniff his hands then scrubbing some more After a while the
panic seems to leave his body

He wraps himself in a towel As the condensation clears from
the glass shower door there seems to be something moving white
against white Then at once the door is flung open Anda
dripping towel-wrapped Hollywood finds himself face to face
with Fantdémas

We have never seen Swann in anything but black Now for the
first time he is white head to toe White trousers white
starched shirt white tie white formal vest white tailcoat

SWANN
You thought I was dead Well
(beat)
These things happen

Swann produces a flat white silk disk snaps it against his
forearm It pops open into a tophat

SWANN (CONTD)
I am the polar bear at your funeral

Swann dons the tophat and in the same motion produces as if
from nowhere a white pearl-handled straight razor

It is Swanns moment of triumph the plan the surprise the
punch lines the tophat and the razor perfect details
perfectly chosen perfectly played

One thing wrong Hollywood Whose reaction is not at all what
it should be

HOLLYWOOD
(calmly)
Sit down

Swann looks straight at him and does not move

HOLLYWOOD (contd)
You are alive for only one reason because
time and time again I did not kill you In
your home At the Watts Towers In that
little room in old Chinatown In your clever
little renovation of the Million Dollar
Theater Sit down Charles

Swann sits

HOLLYWOOD (contd)

HOLLYWOOD (contd)

a sudden your life is what it is You have

very few choices at all Until finally--
Just one The manner and method of your own
death

Swann beginning to see the light

HOLLYWOOD (contd)

I did not kill you because I wanted something
A proper death Not this-- this cancer

(he thumps his chest)
Not died in his sleep Not following
surgery at Cedars of Lebanon Something
elegant something fitting something with a
bit of marvel

Hollywood in complete control exhibits an energy weve not
seen from him in quite some while

EXT HOLLYWOOD MANSION —- NIGHT

Elliot West perched precariously on the windowsill three
stories up He takes a large step to the next sill the one
beneath the bathroom window Looks inside

Sees Swann and Hollywood talking Swann with a blade in his
hand

West extracts his CZ-70 Draws a bead on Swann

Hollywood is in the line of fire But as Swann stands up there
is nothing between Swann and the tip of Wests automatic Then
Hollywood moves again blocking the shot

INT BATHROOM - AS BEFORE

HOLLYWOOD
The kind of death only Fant6émas could provide
My only problem Fantémas was asleep Had
been for twenty years

SWANN
Dear sweet Lord

HOLLYWOOD
So I had to wake him up Put Juve on his
tail I-- I forged some letters tied em

with red ribbon Told Lem Hardt a bunch of
stuff I knew youd force him to spill And
still it did not work So I borrowed Nora

SWANN
All-- To bring me to this room
Hollywood nods swiftly solemnly

SWANN (contd)
Me with a leash around my neck And I never
saw it

We can hear the alarm sirens

HOLLYWOOD
I should tell you while I still can Céline
meant something to me I meant very little to
her I think she wanted your attention
Thats all I was a way to catch your eye
Im sorry it didnt work For all of us

The two men regard each other for the longest time
HOLLYWOOD (CONTD)
Im ready now

(beat)
So are you

The guards now are banging at the door But the room of
course is locked from the inside
EXT MANSION WINDOW - WESTS POV

Hollywood still blocking the target

INT BATHROOM - AS BEFORE

Swann begins to realize just how deeply Hollywood has wished for
this particular death In a strange way its very moving

SWANN
You leave me no choice

HOLLYWOOD
I mean not to

SWANN
My brother

HOLLYWOOD
My killer

With absolute calm Swann runs the straight razor across
Hollywoods pale white neck A perfect arc from which blood
begins to bloom In small rosettes at first Then a thin
sheet like burgundy swirled in a crystal goblet

then torrents
Hollywood clutches his neck falls to the floor his blood
charting its course across the white tiled floor to the shower
drain

EXT MANSION - WESTS POV

As Hollywood falls to the floor West has a clear shot He
draws his bead Begins to squeeze the trigger

Suddenly Eddie--clad in black from head to toe--is swinging
from a rope Douglas Fairbanks-style sweeping from the top of
the onion tower across the side of the mansion

EDDIE
Jarrive

He lands on the bathroom window ledge knocking Wests arm
aside

The two grapple for the gun
As Eddie for the moment gains control of the gun
EDDIE (CONTD)
(softly)
I dont have to I want to
Just below another black-clad FIGURE climbs spider-style up
the craggy wall from the window below Zigging and zagging in
uncanny emulation of the figure-eight web the signal web
Now the second black-clad figure REACHES UP
-and PULLS West by the ankle

The gun falls in a long arc to the manicured lawn below

WEST
You son-of-a-bitch

He flails out--
--and FALLS--
--in a long arc following his gun

-all the way down

IE MANSION - NIGHT - SWANN

strides toward the window opens it lifts himself out

Eddie and Swann embrace and Eddie swings them by rope back to
the top of the onion tower Three stories below the lifeless
body of Elliot West

What Swann doesnt see the other black-clad FIGURE just below
the window ledge The figure--as weve by now figured out--of

front of him bookended by two LAPD escorts

struck A bare spot where the crockery has been blown away
