INT BATHROOM HOLLAR HOUSE DAY

A woman stands in front of a bathroom mirror curling her
hair Her name is SALLY HOLLAR 58 Sally is dressed ina
pink nightgown and robe She is a kind looking woman
Heavy set and motherly with lines of distinction on her
face She takes a breath and faces herself in the mirror
A troubled look flutters across her eyes

An out of shape man opens the door to the bathroom His
name is RON HOLLAR 36 Ron is Sally’s son He looks
surprised to see his mother there

RON
Oh Sorry I thought you weregone

Sally looks annoyed
SALLY
Ronald This is my bathroom If you’re
going to stay here you have to use the
downstairs bathroom

RON
Dad’s in that one

SALLY
Well then you’re going to have to wait

Ron goes to leave then comes back

RON
How long--

SALLY
Close the door

Sally picks up her curling iron

INT KITCHEN HOLLAR HOUSE DAY

Ron holds himself as he looks around the kitchen He
takes a container for juice out of a cupboard and pees
into it A look of relief comes across his face as he
urinates into the container

MAN (0S)
What the hell are you doing

Ron jumps almost spilling everywhere

RON
Jesus Dad you scared me

Ron looks over his shoulder at his father DONALD HOLLAR
62 staring at him Don is a taller angry looking man
He is dressed in flannel pajamas

DON
Your mother puts orange juice in that
thing
Ron can’t stop peeing
RON

I’m going to wash it

Don looks upset But before he can say anything else
Sally screams in the bathroom Glass breaks

Don and Ron give each other a look

INT BATHROOM HOLLAR HOUSE DAY
Ron and Don find Sally shaking on the floor
DON
(totally confused)
Sally What-- What are you doing on the
floor

Hello Hello

INT OFFICE CUBICLE NEW YORK CITY DAY

THE SAME MUSIC CUE FROM THE LAST SCENE CONTINUES as we
come in on a man 34 sitting at a cubicle talking on the
phone He is of average height and weight He has a
common face with a good natured grin He wears a blue
oxford with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows and dark
grey slacks His name is John Hollar Hanging on the
cubicle walls are a few pictures of him with his
girlfriend and many many comic book-esque drawings

John wears a head set as he seemingly draws something
Suddenly the music stops We hear a very southern voice

JOHN (CONTD)
From Routlege PublishingWe spoke last

There is no answer John looks for an invoice number on
his desk As he turns we see what he’s been drawing A
bizarre cartoon of a baby in an ultra sound photo The
baby looks angrily out at John with a word bubble above
it’s head “Oh great”

JOHN (CONTD)
Anyway I’m calling about order number

JOHN
No I’m sorry About your boyfriend
I have a girlfriend who I don’t deserve
She’s beautiful and smart and runs her
own company We’ve been together for 3

questioning and over analyzing our
relationship I’m sure that’s fun for
her Oh and did I mention she’s eight
months pregnant You have kids

VOICE (0S)
--No

JOHN
Well lemme tell ya nothing holds your
life up to a big mirror like a due date

B10 B10

SALLY
(Quietly)
Boys

The boys immediately calm down as a quiet Asian man
enters the room holding a medical chart His name is DR
LARRY FONG 40 Everyone turns to look at him

DR FONG
(to Sally)
Sally Hollar
SALLY
Yes
DR FONG

I’m Doctor Fong Sorry about the wait
(beat) I was golfing

SALLY
No problem Doctor

Dr Fong brings up a cat scan image on a monitor on the
wall

DR FONG
I looked over your cat scans
You have a pretty big brain tumor in the
center of your frontal lobe

DON
Oh Christ Oh Jesus Christ

Don sits down on a chair He starts trembling He is way
overdoing this Sally tries to keep a smile on her face
but she looks terrified

JOHN
What does that mean Pretty big

Dr Fong gives John a serious look

DR FONG
It meansbig

JOHN
So what do we have to do

DR FONG
Were going to have to remove it Soon
I’ve scheduled a craniotomy for the end
of next week

( )

B10 B10
JOHN
Wait Slow down What about a second
opinion
DR FONG

Youre free to do as you wish But I
suggest you do it quickly We can give
your mother steroids to reduce the size
of the tumor But the seizures will
continue if nothings done

RON
Now what will the steroids do to her
muscles Will it make her bulky

DR FONG
(a little confused)

DON
Oh Christ Oh christ Oh christ

RON
Get a grip Dad

Don is not good in a crisis Sally has a nervous smile on
her face

JOHN
Well is itcancer

DR FONG
We won’t know that until we biopsy a
piece of the tumor

JOHN
I don’t understand How did this happen

DR FONG
It could be any number of reasons We
have no way of knowing right now I will
say this it’s not a young tumor I’d say
it’s most likely been growing inside Mrs
Hollar’s head for over ten maybe fifteen
years To be honest I’m surprised there
haven’t been more symptoms

Don looks very nervous
SALLY

Would loss of sight in one eye be a
symptom

( )
B10 B10
DR FONG
Possibly
SALLY
How about a numbness in the toes and
fingers
DR FONG
Probably
SALLY
And temporary paralysis
DR FONG
Well definitely
DON
Shit
SALLY
I told you
JOHN

What What is it

DON
She might have had some symptoms before
today

JOHN
What When Why didn’t you have them
checked out

some stuff to work out so

Dr Fong tries to quietly leave the room John stops him
in the hallway

DR FONG

her head

JOHN

JOHN

INT JOHN’S ROOM HOLLAR HOUSE LATE DAY 12

John walks into his room a bed on either side On one
side it is plastered with original drawings cartoons
and funny portraits of semi-celebrities like Bea Arthur
and the bearded guy from Highway to Heaven The other
side is covered in music posters from Metallica to Lynyrd
Skynrd John looks around wistfully He unpacks his bag
and then suddenly stops

( )

Al3

12

At the bottom of the bag we see what looks like a nicely
bound journal along with a note The note reads “Maybe
youll get some ideas for this while you’re home Love
Becca” He opens up the journal and flips through one
third of a beautifully drawn graphic novel We recognize
the lead character from some of the drawings hanging in
John’s cubicle He throws the book on the bed and looks
out the window

EXT HOLLAR HOUSE LATE DAY Al13

From outside the house we see John looking out the window
of the bedroom he lived in for 18 years Suddenly we
see a few neighborhood kids run by playing “Kick the
Can” John notices

INT HOSPITAL ROOM MORNING 13

John walks to the open door of his mother’s hospital
room He finds his mother and father sleeping His mother
sleeps on the hospital bed and his father sleeps on a
chair next to her They hold hands John looks very
touched by the sight of his parents together in this way

movie theater in the world to be built
with speakers for sound movies Your dad
would get off work at 5 and I’d leave
our apartment at 3 and walk down to the
Fox There was never a show at that time
And I’d go in And I would sit ina
seat And I’d look up at the ceiling
It was unlike anything I’d ever seen with
its beautiful design and colors And
this enormous chandelier It was made
from 1200 pieces of glass It was
breathtaking And every day I’d go
back I’d go in And I’d look up
