HARD CUT TO AN EXTREME CLOSE UP

INT BELL’S CAR - AFTER DAWN
A woman’s eyes closed
Blinking open in a fearsome sunlight

As we widen we see that the sunlight comes through a
windshield

That she’s in a car
That she’s a cop
She looks pretty rough

Gets out of the car This is DETECTIVE BELL

EXT BOWTIE PROJECT PARK - AFTER DAWN
We follow her through the park quiet at this hour
Early sunlight is hard on her A bit of a wreck

We see her goal ahead Cops gathered at a crime scene above
the concrete and wild growth of the LA River

HER POV Eyes flicking back to see her approach Disrespect
there maybe amusement

DET KUDRA is in charge older His partner DET GAVRAS a
young together Latina

DET GAVRAS
Long night

DET KUDRA
Dragging anchor there buddy

It looks like it
BELL
Dragging anchor

DET KUDRA
You know the LT is looking for you
Need to take care of your own
pressing shit don’t you

BELL
Yeah I got it

She moves up into the scene

DET KUDRA
Hey Bell This is handled so

Bell waves him off

BELL
So what is it

Then she looks down at
A BODY
A male face down

DET KUDRA
You want us to uh

BELL
Yeah come on

From Gavras a barely perceptible impatient rolling of eyes
Not missed by Bell

DET KUDRA
Shot three times at least from the
exit wounds Right here

BELL
With

Gavras just trying to get it over with

DET GAVRAS
-38 dropped at the scene

She points On the ground apistol handle wrapped in dirty
red tape

DET GAVRAS
« maybe a ghost gun no serial
no prints no witnesses Look
BELL
Am I wasting your time

Casual a verbal shrug

DET GAVRAS
City’s time You got no role here
Our scene

Kudra glances at Gavras okay enough

Bell leans down over the body A moment on her face an
intensity a disturbance rippling underneath

BELL
Who’s this

DET KUDRA
No ID no idea

Bell nods then looks at the back of the victim’s shaved
head

A distinctive tattoo visible on the base of the neck

Under and near the body something interesting Several 100

dollar bills deeply stained in purple from an exploded dye

pack are scattered around the body a couple of them barely
visible just underneath it

DET KUDRA
Few of those Blown dye pack but
not interestingly recent Waiting
on tech

A couple other cops approach As Kudra and Gavras turn to
engage them we stay on Bell Looking closely at the tattoo
the bills under and near the body We close in on one of the
bills

For a moment the other detectives seem to forget her She’s
an afterthought Finally glance back

DET KUDRA
This is covered Go lie down

However he intended it it comes off harsh Suppressed smiles
from cops

BELL
What about if I know who did this

Kudra looks at her and shakes his head
DET KUDRA
Then we could probably use that
detective You gonna solve this
right now then or
She walks away from them

DET GAVRAS
The fuck she’s going

DET KUDRA
The fuck I know Just leave her
INT BELL’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Bell sits on her own Still not looking good Disturbed
distant

A rhythm insinuates itself A skateboarder watched by a
couple friends is trying to land a trick A whoosh a
clatter as he fails Again

Bell watching thinking

The skateboarder tries again Fails CUT TO

BLACK A title

DESTROYER

INT NORTHWEST DIVISION - MORNING

Bell enters the precinct Preoccupied a cup of coffee to cut
through the haze Ahead her superior LT OSHIMA

LT OSHIMA
You getting your mail here now

BELL
I don’t get it What

LT OSHIMA
I’m saying apparently you live
here

BELL
I spend a lot of time here yeah

She tries to keep moving It works He’s unwilling to chase

INT BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER

From behind we see Bell hunched over her desk She holds
something she’s found there

An envelope addressed to her in a handwritten scrawl She
opens it Pulls something out of it-- an ink-stained hundred
dollar bill just like the ones near the body

Looks over her shoulder Room crowded with cops Thinks

INT SUPPLY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We close in on Bell alone in the locked room

She stares at the marked hundred dollar bill

Very close on the bill Deeply stained

Mind moving stress growing Near the intensity of panic
She puts the bill into an evidence bag Puts the bag in a
backpack

INT BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

As Bell moves toward the front door we watch her from across
the room through other people

Walking across the bullpen pace increasing A sharp tamped-
down urgency to her movements
EXT NORTHWEST DIVISION - MORNING
She throws the backpack into the backseat of her car gets
in
INT BELL’S CAR - DAY
Bell drives
A voice insinuates itself
SILAS (VO)

Look at that face Little dog
You’re hungry

We rotate slowly behind her Find a scar at the base of her
neck where a tattoo has been removed The same location as
the tattoo on the body in Echo Park The faint remnant of the
same shape

SILAS (VO)
Hungry little mutt You want

EXT FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY

The monumental government office building in Westwood The
Los Angeles branch of the FBI

LAWSON (0S)
Detective Bell

INT CAFE - CONTINUOUS

Bell sits across from a smiling GIL LAWSON (50s) an FBI
lifer in the corner of the building’s almost empty cafe

LAWSON
My God if I knew you were coming
I could’ve rustled up more of a
welcome party

BELL
I only wanted to see you

Something in her voice cuts off the small talk

LAWSON
What’s up

BELL
Silas is back

A pause Lawson sits back looks at Bell-- a strange almost
sad look

BELL
He’s back I know it Somewhere in
LA

LAWSON

What makes you say that

Bell produces a clear sleeve containing the ink-stained bill
Lawson’s demeanor shifts

LAWSON
Where’d you get this
BELL
I got it

Lawson looks at Bell but that’s all she’s giving up

LAWSON
Why now

BELL
Cleaning up Starting again I
don’t know

LAWSON
Well we’ve had nothing on this
end Not since it all happened
What 17 years now

He subtly examines the bill

LAWSON
If this is a match it’s gonna
light up a lot of people up and
down the hall How did

Bell looks down

BELL
I need you to look this up for me
and then forget that you did At
least for awhile I want to be
sure

LAWSON
All right

He gets to his feet switching gears as Bell follows him

LAWSON
How’s Shelby How old is she now

BELL
Sixteen

LAWSON
Incredible

Pause

BELL
I don’t remember your kids’ names

LAWSON
(a laugh)
That’s okay Come on
He puts a hand on her shoulder as he leads her toward the
exit

LAWSON
Been way too long Erin
BELL
I know
As they walk away--
LAWSON

I look different Been making these
protein smoothies

Slow motion as Bell follows Lawson past a few occupied
tables Bell seems uncomfortable

BELLS POV The eyes of the agents seem to be on her

Lawson nods to one them as he passes

INT LAWSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Lawsons office has a commanding view of the 405 freeway

LAWSON
Close the door

She does so as he wakes his computer

LAWSON
Let’s see it

BELL
Look if this is going to jam you
up with anybody

LAWSON
(looking up)
Don’t do it You don’t mean that

A small smile from Bell
LAWSON
Fuck ‘em Far as I’m concerned

you’re one of us

Lawson brings up a database of stolen bills As he hunt-and-
pecks the number in
LAWSON
You’re lucky the numbers from that
job are in the database Bank only
tracks those big shipments Most of
the time we’re screwed as far that
goes

As he waits for the result
LAWSON
How much is still out there 3

million 4

ON BELL a noncommittal shrug She watches his face as the
result comes up

BELL
It’s a match yeah

He nods He looks to Bell who is off in her own world
LAWSON
Hey Why don’t you tell me where
you got this Let me handle it We
can still keep it between us

BELL
I’m sorry I can’t

He looks at her for a moment seems to choose his words

LAWSON
What happened was
BELL
No Gil
LAWSON

We put you and Chris there Too
green Shit deal you weren’t
ready

Bell betrays nothing

LAWSON

You know how most of these leads
go This has been ice cold for a
long time Toby’s in Chino the
rest they’re all gone

(pause)
Do you want to go down that hole
again for nothing I’1l1 call you if
something comes up

BELL
I’1l be all right

Silence Lawson sighs He considers Bell for a long moment

LAWSON
You look terrible
BELL
I had a rough night
LAWSON
Have a lot of those
(pause)

Did you ever talk to someone

BELL
A little

LAWSON
I check in on you you know Most
detectives with your years in
would’ve been moved up to RHD a
long time ago

BELL
Come on Gil

LAWSON

Okay

(pause)
Look I don’t know if this is your
thing but I do a Bible study on
Wednesday nights Anytime you want
to pop by

(sees her look)
I know but it’s very low-key No

it’s good to not be alone you
know

(pause)
Think about it

Bell sits at the bar empty drink in front of her on edge
We’re on her face The sound of the game the other patrons

The bartender passes Bell points at her drink

BARTENDER
Double rum and coke

She gives a thumbs up-- suddenly there’s a drink in front of
her Time now passes in waves-- the game jumps forward-- the
drinks arrive almost on top of each other As another lands
the game is gone replaced by the news The bar is crowded
now Bell looks more relaxed

A GUY roughly her age pushes into the bar next to her to
order Bell glances up He’s decent looking Okay

BELL
You’re too old for this place

He forces a smile doesn’t bite

BELL
You want to see a trick

GUY

INT LITTLE JOY - NIGHT

A semi-hip Echo Park bar Bell enters somewhat keyed-up She
walks through scanning the rooms

The sound of a laugh somehow cuts through the rest of the
noise Bell pushes through the crowd toward the corner--

A couple is draped all over each other kissing JAY a wiry
skater-looking guy (20s) looks up as Bell approaches

BELL
You don’t care

JAY

The bouncer turns back to Jay

BOUNCER
Get the fuck out

As the bouncer “escorts” Jay and Shelby to the door the
bouncer looks to the bartender motions toward Bell with a
shrug-- “What the fuck do I do with her”
The bartender and Bell lock eyes
BELL
She’s underage In your fucking

bar

He doesn’t say anything The whole thing is weird The whole
place is paralyzed Bell suddenly feels all the eyes on her

EXT SUNSET BLVD - NIGHT

Bell waits by her car outside the bar We hear the sound of a
phone call a voice answering

INT BELL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

We observe Bell from a distance as she eats Watch her
behave

Preoccupied she huddles over her food like a starving
animal protecting it from someone who wants to take it away

She raises her head Alert A creature who has caught
something on the wind She listens looks out the window down
to the street

Nothing there

INT CRAWLSPACE - HOUSE - ANGELINO HEIGHTS - MORNING

advertising his HVAC business on the side

ETHAN

INT EXT METAL FABRICATOR - DAY

TAZ FURNER military tattoos leans against his pickup truck
which is parked in the shed-like interior of a steel
fabrication business talking to another guy

When the other guy goes back to a foreman’s office Bell
rolls up

Loud mainstream country is playing from the truck

BELL
Turn that shit down so we can talk

TAZ
I thought you liked country music

BELL
That’s not country music Taz

He shrugs

TAZ
Baby likes it

She looks inside the truck There’s an 13-month old squirming
in a car seat

BELL
Really

TAZ
What else I’m supposed to do I’m
an involved parent man Where’s
Antonio at

BELL
He’s not here for this

TAZ

BELL
Murder weapon Smells like it comes
from you

TAZ
Whoa what

BELL
I’m saying I have a body and the
gun comes from you

TAZ
No No no no you got no way of
knowing that

BELL
Because it’s a burner with no
serial probably built from spare
parts which is something you do
So I know

TAZ
But I mean that’s like fuckin
circular

BELL
I’m gonna need everybody you’ve
been selling to

TAZ
I can’t tell you that I got
credibility with my clients

BELL

Specifically the crazy white
people

TAZ

She reaches into the truck zips open a heavy canvas duffel

TAZ
Hey

The bag contains both long guns and handguns Bell takes the
bag out of the truck He tries to grab it She rips it away

BELL
I’m taking these with me

TAZ

The other guy the one who Taz had been talking to reappears
on a landing above

TAZS GUY

TAZ

The air has changed It’s precarious Her alone the two of
them much bigger projecting the potential of violence

TAZ
Don’t do it fool

She hauls the bag to her car Taz follows pushing up on her
His friend following looking around as if for witnesses

BELL
Call me with names you want em
back

TAZ
For real You are fucking up right
now Don’t make me notice you
He tries to grab the bag again She rips it away violently

BELL
Give me some names

She throws the bag into her car gets in
IN BELL’S CAR
As she pulls away Taz pounds on the car

TAZ
You are fucking up

She drives It takes a second to notice her hand shaking on
the wheel
INT BELL’S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

CHRIS
So I know I don’t want to look
surprised the first time it happens
in public
She looks at him for moment--

CHRIS
Dead serious

She takes the back of his head with one hand and pulls him in
for a long kiss

They break considering each other Neither betrays anything

CHRIS
Okay Got it
A flicker of a smile between them

BELL
You think you can fake liking that

CHRIS
Probably yeah

SOUND OF A CELL PHONE RINGING from the caller’s end It
rings and rings no one picking up into and over

INT BELL’S HOUSE - LATE DUSK

The house is darkened A still shot empty waiting
Then we are surprised to see movement

Bell shifts gets out of a chair like a mound of vegetation
that has come to life

Just a silhouette

We see what moved her outside a car has pulled up and
parked She watches it for a moment staying out of view

A man gets out of the car looks around We recognize Gil
Lawson the FBI agent from Westwood

She puts her gun in her waistband

EXT BELL’S STREET - NIGHT
Bell comes out strong rattling down the steps

Gil just coming around the car looks up to see her coming
He has a bottle of wine

LAWSON

LAWSON
Not like man you are difficult
to talk to You know that

Bell waits Looks up and down the street Nobody is around
He holds up the bottle

LAWSON

BELL

LAWSON

Because that’s a normal social
custom that normal people I
don’t know Because you definitely
aren’t going to come to bible
study

BELL
No I’m not Why

LAWSON
Because I’m worried about you

Bell keeps her distance

LAWSON
Can we go inside This is

BELL
This is good

He cocks his head Shrugs

LAWSON
Alright then I came here to say
that I don’t think it’s good for
you to be scratching up all this

BELL
Who says it isn’t healthy Who says
that

He turns a small smile looking over his shoulder as if
expecting someone back to her

LAWSON
Me
(pause)
Who else

BELL
You came to my house

LAWSON
I’m an old fashioned guy who shows
up to visit his friends in person

She waves this away Finally

LAWSON
Since I saw you it’s been
bothering me I wouldn’t have come
if it wasn’t important

BELL
You are telling me to let it go

LAWSON
I see where you are going and I
don’t think it’s good for you I
had to say something

She watches him Dusk has now put him in shadow made him a
silhouette Inscrutable

BELL
Who wants it let go Gil Spell it
out

LAWSON

There’s nothing nothing to spell
out Erin Just let it be

He looks around at the empty street Bell shifts
imperceptibly A queasy unplaceable menace here now
Quietly

LAWSON
You don’t need somebody to talk to

Something coiled and wired in her

Gil puts the bottle on the curb goes around and gets back in
his car Out the window

LAWSON
You really ought to fix your phone

As he drives away we linger on her Her gun hand free

Bell and Chris enter the packed house smoke hanging in the
air Music overdriven so loud it distorts A couple people

push out past them

Toby moves into frame arms around their shoulders

TOBY
Let’s meet the man

They walk We are in Bell’s POV as they come around a corner
to the living room where everyone is looking at someone

Silas
Finally he looks up
Lets us see his eyes

Close on his eyes They could make you do anything

EXT TOBY’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - PALM DESERT - MORNING

A battered nondescript bungalow A few tchotchkes by the
door work hard to liven things up

We watch from afar as Bell approaches the door It’s answered
by an OLDER WOMAN And after a brief conversation she lets
Bell inside

MOTHER (0S)
Toby you’ve got a visitor
INT TOBY’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
There’s a hospital bed in the living room A TV plays TOBY
(late 30’s) unshaven lies in the bed Cancer He’s been

through the wringer but his eyes are sharp behind his specs

Toby’s MOM 70s cat sweatshirt leads Bell into the room
As soon Toby sees her a laugh overtaken by coughs

TOBY
Jesus You look old

Bell takes him in The older sicker version of him

TOBY
Fucking Bell Of course you’re
here

BELL

How you doing Toby

TOBY
Incredible They released me
because I’m just too healthy
She exits

MOM
I was just on my way out
(kisses Toby)
I’m going to step out to the store

TOBY
Yeah you do that And will you
just get the cookies this time I
don’t care about the fucking sugar
We’re past that

MOM
Well see

TOBY
Yeah we know what that means

Bell and Toby look at each other for a long moment Toby is
having trouble breathing

Toby strained points to the shelves behind Bell They’re
packed with owl figurines All sorts They’re everywhere

TOBY
Do me a favor Turn that one away
The dirty beige one Turn it so
it’s not facing me

She does so It seems to bring him relief

He coughs

TOBY
You tell one fucking person you
like owls now every genius knows
what to get you She could’ve
stopped it anytime but no She
loves it

BELL
So what They make her happy

TOBY
That cutesy fucking thing is going
to be the last thing I see Gonna
be staring me in

agitated His eyes are wet as he settles

BELL
How long
TOBY
(shakes his head)
Couple months Might be able to leg
out four or five probably not

He’s wheezing It seems to make him angrier

TOBY
Why the fuck are you here

BELL
Silas is back

Bell lets that hang stares at him Toby looks away
TOBY

I ain’t gonna spend my last days
thinking about Silas

BELL
He’s a murderer I need to bring
him in

TOBY

How do you even know he’s back

BELL
He sent a message

TOBY
Jesus You’re so fucking sad
You’1l never get close to him You
know that How do you know he’s
back Because he let you

BELL
You’re still scared of him

TOBY
Scared of what That he’1ll come
kill me a few days early Kill my
mom Shit take her

BELL
He’s coming Toby Finally cleaning
up maybe It’s already started
Youre easy to find

TOBY
I told you I don’t care I’m
fucking dead

BELL
Don’t go out like this Toby This
is pathetic Do something good for
once Make that your last act I
gotta believe you have it in you

Toby starts laughing which turns into a coughing fit

TOBY
Go out on a good note I don’t know
where he is Bell If I did I
would’ve traded that a long time
ago and taken my chances You think
I chose to rot in Chino for 15
years

BELL
You chose to rob banks

TOBY
Yeah well I can’t give you Silas

He lets her get up before he hits her with it

TOBY
But I’1l give you Arturo

BELL
Arturo How

TOBY
We found ways to keep in touch
Just in case I can get you to him

BELL
Where is he

TOBY
(shakes his head)
It’s not free

BELL
What do you want Toby

A weird pained look on his face With some effort he pulls
back the blanket exposing himself

BELL
Jesus Christ No Fuck you
TOBY
Fuck you You could’ve let me go
(coughs )

This is what it costs

BELL
It’s not going to happen

TOBY
Ill bet you’d do a lot worse
things for a shot at Silas

BELL
No

Neither believes that Toby looks her straight in the eye

TOBY
You have nothing else I value

Bell fumes a caged animal Stock still she looks ready to
burn the house down

TOBY
Youre my last chance Bell And
I’m yours

After a long moment a cold blackness falls over her Staring
right at him she takes him in her hand

BELL
I should rip it off

TOBY
But you won’t
(pause)
Move in front of the owls

Bell steps to her right blocking the shelf from view and
starts Toby lets out a breath Silence except for the TV

TOBY
Open your shirt

BELL
No

TOBY
Open your shirt

Bell looks at him in utter contempt Unbuttons her shirt
Toby sighs as she continues

It goes on for a moment interrupted by an intense coughing
fit by Toby

TOBY
Keep going

He wheezes as she does so It’s a bit of a labor He looks
pained as he tries to concentrate

TOBY
Spit on it

BELL
Fuck you

After some effort he comes with a weird grunt She wipes her
hand on his shirt as Toby catches his breath

BELL
Fucking hell So

TOBY
He’s back in the city somewhere

BELL
Somewhere

TOBY
Works at some little Iglesia on the
east side Christo Resucitado it’s
called Sits there all day giving
free legal advice to immigrants
Guess he’s got a guilty conscience
or something

BELL
And what about you How’s your
conscience

TOBY

(shrugs )
I didn’t shoot anyone That girl in
the bank was just fucking dumb
That’s on her

(pause)
Same with Chris He didn’t have to
be a hero

She masks it but the mention of the name is a gut punch

BELL
No He didn’t

TOBY
I mean I kind of liked him but he
chose to play So

BELL
Okay

TOBY
But he was all right

She heads to the door On her way out she turns the owl back
to face him

BELL
Have a nice month

TOBY
Fuck you We were a family
EXT IGLESIA CHRISTO RESUCITADO - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

Bell is parked across the street from a humble storefront
church watching Toby’s words continue uninterrupted

TOBY (VO)

the ones who stabbed us in the

back Not the other way around
She can detect no movement It’s closed up
Bell dials Shelby It rings and rings No answer no

EXT IGLESIA CHRISTO RESUCITADO - MOMENTS LATER
Bell approaches the church

She notes a schedule posted on the wall-- “Servicios Martes

Bell’s phone rings Glances at it She picks it up Before
she can speak a voice

cheap Chinese place

BELL

SHELBY

Bell ignores this keeping her eyes on her daughter

SHELBY
You don’t think you made a mistake

BELL

Bell reaches for her is shrugged off violently
Shelby is already outside Gone Bell knows she’s blown it
BELL

EXT STREET IGLESIA CHRISTO RESUCITADO - NIGHT
Bell sits in her car back in front of the storefront church

At night it’s transformed Street dark but there’s singing
inside light inside spilling out Life inside

Smoke from a grill on the sidewalk curls in front of the
light

People start to come out service over

INT IGLESIA CHRISTO RESUCITADO - NIGHT

Bell walks into the church People are picking up folding up
metal chairs People look at her she looks at them

A small knot of people talking to the preacher
She approaches them A man steps forward

MAN

BELL
Yes I hope so I was told that
here I could

She puts on a nervous face She’s a good liar

BELL
I need to see Arturo Guerrero

The man’s expression falls for just a moment

MAN
No I’m sorry

BELL
Please I know he’s here

MAN
He isn’t How did you find us Who
sent you here

BELL
I was told not to say

MAN

One of the other people starts to head down a hallway Bell
grabs his arm to stop him

BELL
I need help Alba she takes care
of my kids They are going to
deport her I don’t know what to
do I can pay I can pay

The people exchange looks

MAN

He goes down a hallway She follows

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
A short hallway At the end an office door

The man gestures for Bell to sit in a chair against the wall
She remains standing

She watches the door
A woman comes out holding a folder of papers She turns
back embraces the man who has followed her out of the

office

Arturo

INT GANG HOUSE - 17 YEARS AGO - DAY

swivels Gun up--

-- a woman covers her face and screams dropping folders--
-- while across the room a door bangs open Arturo is out

Bell runs

EXT COMMERCIAL STREET - SAME

Bell runs after Arturo up the street

Shuttered businesses acid streetlight few people

Arturo darts onto a residential street

Bell follows

When she turns onto the street she can’t see him anymore

Two ways he could have gone One direction an alley and
bungalows The other a long driveway

She goes down the alley

EXT ALLEY SIDES OF HOUSES - CONTINUOUS

Bell moves through the dark

Sound of her breath She’s lost him

Swallowed by complete dark until--

Motion detector tripped floodlights up in the alley
BLINDING LIGHT catches Arturo turning the corner

She runs after him

EXT END OF HOUSES SCRUB HILL - CONTINUOUS
Bell is fixated

Chasing him farther from other people
Farther from help

Headlong and undeterred by what she might be headed for

Arturo reaches the end of the row of houses which abuts a
scrub hill
Arturo scrambles up into the scrub
Running out of breath Looks behind him hoping she’s gone
Bell is still there slowing but not stopping

BELL
Arturo

He runs

Leaving the pool of light

EXT SCRUB HILL - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly in the wilderness Arturo keeps going
Stumbles rolling his ankle

Cries out

Leading Bell to the next hill

EXT ELYSIAN PARK - HILLSIDE

He climbs desperately

Bell gaining

Sound of helicopters and the wild leaking in
Arturo now almost crawling

BELL
Arturo

Bell following An existential climb

BELL

Just fucking stop
She reaches up to try to grab him He kicks out at her
rubble clattering down Kicks again

She fends it off

He reaches the top throws himself onto

Arturo breathes
BELL

How do I find him

ARTURO

Bell Hiding from him I don’t talk
to anybody

BELL

ARTURO
Save for what

BELL
For a plea I’m not arresting you

You understand

ARTURO
Okay

BELL

Bell looks at him closely He looks scared of her He shakes
his head puts his head in his hands grabs handfuls of hair

ARTURO

BELL

Okay
ARTURO

He helps launder the money and
distributes it Petra sees him for
that every once in a while Petra’s
still with Silas

A FLASH

woman

EXT ELYSIAN PARK - CONTINUING - NIGHT

BELL

BELL
That’s funny

He shrugs She smiles darkly
BELL
So when’s it add up to even How do

Bell doesn’t answer

ARTURO
I wish I thought you could get him

HIS POV She is lit from behind in the wash of stadium lights

from below Her face completely in shadow a pool of black
Steam rising from her sweat rise and fall of shoulders

EXT BELL’S HOUSE - DAWN

Bell sits on her steps Whatever she’s thinking about is
hidden from us She rocks back and forth almost
imperceptibly

Dawn light creeping up Fireworks or a shot echo up from
far away She stands and we abruptly cut to

INT GANG HOUSE - THE PAST - NIGHT

The communal home for Silas’s crew It’s dilapidated-- second-
hand furniture walls bare

The crew is partying Weed coke beer A couple of guns
litter the table as well Heavy music blares

People strewn everywhere smoking arguing hooking up Chris
and Toby are playing Madden football talking shit

Silas a ball of energy half wrestleshalf makes out with a
woman on the couch laughing taunting Petra sulks around
the edges

Arturo returns from a beer run setting a case down

ARTURO
New soldiers ready for action

He grabs one for himself and flops down on a couch making
himself at home in Bell’s lap

BELL
Support the troops

Bell laughs strokes his head Something about this catches
Silas’s eye A beat then--

SILAS
Hey Arturo

Silas scoops up a revolver from the table empties a few
bullets spins the barrel--

SILAS
-- let’s see if it’s your time

-- and tosses it at Arturo who barely catches it
TOBY
What the hell Silas

INT GANG HOUSE - THE PAST - NIGHT

The room has gone silent save the musicTV All eyes on

ARTURO
Huh

Silas mimes shooting his own head

SILAS
Let’s find out huh

Arturo tries to laugh it off Silas shakes it off

SILAS
Come on

CHRIS
Fuck that Don’t do it Arturo

Silas still sprawled on the ratty couch calmly takes up
another gun gestures toward Chris with it

SILAS
This doesn’t concern you brother

Chris raises his hands reluctantly backing down Bell and he
exchange a quick glance Silas addresses the room

SILAS
This is about Arturo And Arturo’s
got free will It’s his decision
His

He locks on the freaked-out looking Arturo

SILAS
Don’t do anything you aren’t
comfortable with There’s no
judgements

Arturo can see the gun dangling in Silas’s hand He hefts the
one in his own about to look down

SILAS
No
(points to his eye)
Look here Just do it Or don’t

Arturo looks at Silas but he’s alone His breathing faster
faster Trying to will himself

Bell and the others-- helpless wishing it away

Silas sitting forward on the couch like a gargoyle bouncing
with anticipation

Arturo almost hyperventilating Tears Suddenly he yanks the
gun bracing-- a collective gasp as he pulls the trigger--

Click Nothing Arturo melts exhaling deeply Silas sinks
back looks him up and down

SILAS
Jesus man You gotta stop letting
people push you around like that
Fuck

Arturo drops the gun and storms out Silas taps the leg of
the WOMAN next to him

SILAS
Go fuck him

ARTURO (0S)
I don’t feel like fucking

Silas nods the woman toward the door-- do it anyway
The room looks shaken except for Silas who is thrilled

Chris picks up the gun from the floor notices something--

CHRIS
There were three fucking bullets in
there

SILAS

Fuck really

He winks at Chris moves on Bell looks to Chris each using
the other to remain calm to keep it together

EXT DIFRANCO’S HOUSE - PALOS VERDES - DAY

A large Spanish style house built on the side of a hill An
unobstructed view of the Pacific

Bell gets out of her car rings the buzzer at the gate After
a moment a MAN’S VOICE over the speaker

DIFRANCO (0S)
Come around the side Detective
Bell We’re in the back

A buzz The gate opens and we follow Bell as she makes her
way along the side of the house A metallic clank can be
heard every couple seconds-- across the yard DiFranco’s
teenage son RYAN takes cuts in a batting cage

A BODYGUARD beckons her toward the open patio doors that lead
to the living room

INT LIVING ROOM KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
DENNIS DIFRANCO stands up smiling

DIFRANCO
Dennis DiFranco You want an iced
tea or something A beer I’m
having iced tea

BELL
How do you know my name

DIFRANCO
Pleasure to meet you Mr DiFranco
What a lovely home you have

(MORE )

DIFRANCO (CONTD)
Spectacular view Jesus honey Do
like people do

Bell doesn’t bite stares at him DiFranco shrugs

DIFRANCO

Arturo said youd be coming

(holds up a hand)
And before you get all frothy he
calls me I have no idea where he
is And every time I get a call
from Arturo I report it to the FBI
and we go through all the motions

(gestures to his house)
I do know something about the law

Through a window DiFranco spots something in the batting
cage He storms out of the room going outside

DIFRANCO
Goddamnit Ryan What did Mike tell
you about your elbow

Bell watches through the window as DiFranco angrily makes his
son demonstrate the correct form Finally DiFranco huffs
back into the room muttering

DIFRANCO
Jesus Christ
(looks at Bell)
Okay why don’t do we get to
whatever you’ve come here to accuse
me of

BELL
You’re funneling money to Silas
Howe Money from the Palm Springs
job

A pause DiFranco laughs

DIFRANCO
Is that what Arturo told you

BELL
Sounded credible to me

DIFRANCO
Arturo is a weak and desperate man
I keep advising him to surrender
He’1l be much happier

BELL
Why does he call you

DIFRANCO
Because he’s under the mistaken
impression that I can help him in
some way Money favors I don’t
fucking know

BELL
Because you knew Petra

DIFRANCO
Her father and I golfed back when
she was in high school so we were
acquainted Pretty girl Fun

He smiles

BELL
You had sex with her when she was a
minor
(pause)
That’s the “fun” Yes

A long pause DiFranco’s smile warps Finally--

DIFRANCO
She got in trouble a couple times
Drugs I helped her out That was
twenty years ago

BELL
Bullshit

Seeing something out of the corner of his eye DiFranco yells
toward the open window

DIFRANCO
Elbow Elbow Fuck

He returns his attention to Bell

DIFRANCO
Who the fuck do you think you’re
talking to

BELL
Silas and Petra used you to hide
their money from the bank job
(silence)
I’m guessing it’s almost gone
That’s why Silas resurfaced And
youre going to tell me where
Silence

DIFRANCO

I am Or what You’re going to take
me in Use Arturo’s statement to
turn me Let me ask you something
Did you arrest Arturo Is he
currently in custody

(looking around)
And where’s your partner

DIFRANCO
I think you’re down here on your
own playing out some little
vendetta Maybe coloring outside
the lines on this one

BELL
Where’s the next money drop

DIFRANCO

I did some Googling Bell I know
your whole sad story that bank
What you failed to prevent Silas
really fucked you up good He’s
special like that though

(pause)
You know what successful people do
Detective Bell They get over shit
They move on They build things
Big fucking houses on cliffs in
Palos Verdes Would you call your
life since Palm Springs a success

BELL
Where’s the next drop

DIFRANCO

You ever watch Super Chicken
Stupid fucking cartoon old
Anyway whenever they’d get into a
jam Super Chicken’s sidekick would
start to complain and Super Chicken
would say “You knew the job was
dangerous when you took it Fred”

(points at her)
You knew the job was dangerous when
you took it Right You chose to
play cops and robbers And you lost
bad So get over it

BELL
Silas is a murderer and youre
going to help me bring him in

DIFRANCO
Youre barking up the wrong tree
hon And the more you insist on
doing it the sadder and stupider
you look You know

She doesn’t answer Something occurs to him

DIFRANCO
Looking back do you think it was
your stupidity that got those
people killed

Bell snaps moves on him She’s barely got a hand on DiFranco
before the BODYGUARD appears behind her from the house Bell
takes a hard punch to the kidney-- she goes down The guard
kicks her in the side for good measure

Bell writhes on the ground heaving The guard grabs her gun
stuffs it in his coat pocket DiFranco looks down at her

DIFRANCO
How’d you think this was going to
go Roll up with your badge ask me
a few questions with that hang dog
look and I’d just confess Has that
ever happened You have no

leverage

Bell struggles to her feet the guard watchful Her strength
punctured DiFranco looks her in the eyes

DIFRANCO
Youll never touch Silas Because
he’s in your head And he’s smarter
than you
(to the bodyguard)
Show her out

He falls hard to the grass his cheek open and gushing Bell
doesn’t stop delivering a series a vicious blows

RYAN (0S)

In the cage Ryan backs away fumbles for his phone DiFranco
sputters furious--

DIFRANCO
NO Don’t fucking call anyone

BELL
Yeah don’t call Your dad probably
hasn’t hidden things as well as he
shouldve

Bell takes out her gun--

DIFRANCO
Please Please

-- she keeps it at her side watchful of the house and Ryan

BELL
Here’s where I’m smarter than
you I don’t think I have Silas

under control You think you’ve got
any choice with him He’s
controlling you You’re his

DiFranco looks weak scared A tough guy who’s never been
hit

BELL
He’s out of money isn’t he

He hesitates She moves like she’s going to kick him

DIFRANCO
Almost Yes

BELL
You better hope whatever he’s
planning pays off You think he’s
going to let the payouts stop

DiFranco shakes his head resigned

BELL
When’s the next drop

DIFRANCO

Always been underestimated You
want to be recognized Want to be
seen You want to be powerful You
want to have power over people

She doesn’t look away

But you can’t do what you want

what you want

INT BELL’S CAR - PETRA’S STREET - MORNING

With Bell as she watches-- she has been up all night staking
the place out

Petra finally emerges on the phone with someone The
conversation seems intense

The driver from yesterday follows her out waits for her to
finish her conversation

When she is done the two walk past their parked car
Right toward Bell

She shrinks slides her gun out But they are animatedly
talking with one another

Still walking in her direction they stop a few cars short

she is doing

After a few moments Petra opens her door

Petra gets out sunglasses on shoulders a large handbag She
walks around the corner The Honda pulls away past her

Bell creeps her car up closer watches Petra is now walking
up the street

Halfway down the block Petra finds another woman younger
greets her The woman is also wearing sunglasses and a long
coat

A sprinter van approaches stops

Four men emerge

A startling sight It takes a second to process

They wear masks

They never stop moving up steps that lead

toward a bank

As the van pulls away

Petra and the long-coated woman pull masks on rush behind
them

One of the men long dark hair flowing behind his mask

We see she has an MP5 submachinegun
We follow her up towards the bank

toward the bank

She looks at her watch approaching the front of the bank

INT LOBBY VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS

Strain of the situation evident on her face

She moves to the bank entrance The blinds have been pulled
covering the glass door and windows

Bell leans carefully to see through an opening in the blinds
BELL’S POV

Customers and a guard on the floor Silas visible speaking
loudly can’t hear what he’s saying

It looks unstable
Imprecise

Bad body language in the younger men and women of the crew
Unsettled

All seen by Bell

INSIDE THE BANK

Shouting The crew is amped up
Petra tries to calm them

They are all over the place Money starts to come out in
duffels from behind the counter the vault

Bell watches Silas

Thinking Managing her breathing

against the wall by the inside entrance She holds up her
badge

over the disarmed guard A gun waved recklessly One kicks
the guard

Situation deteriorating

Then a customer runs for the door

Screams start

Bell finds Silas as he runs toward the back Fires misses
he’s gone

Both cops still shouting
Bell advances behind check-writing kiosk ducks just as
rounds hit right above her head Sizzling sound

The female cop is trying to move up with Bell as panicked
people run past her toward the door

Bell pops up

Gunfire chews up the kiosk

She ducks back down Leans around the side

Fires three bursts

Wild fire in return

The male cop fires his shotgun

Hits the long-coated woman in the upper torso and neck
She staggers back falling over a crawling customer
Silas is moving toward the back door

A gang member near Petra fires hitting the male cop who
falls to one knee

The cop’s partner drags him behind a planter

Bell advances exposing herself to fire blasting away at
Silas

He’s ducking through an office

Bell ducks behind a desk

Petra and the two remaining men are firing at her

And then they disappear into the back the same way Silas
went

A moment of quiet

Moaning

Crying

Crunch of glass

Bell pops up

All gang members are out

She moves

Glances at an unmoving body Camo Mask soaked in blood

And by the door past the long-coated woman who is holding
her throat squirming on the floor

The injured male cop is heard radioing in

The female cop moves up kneels next to the wounded long-
coated woman

Wild shots back up at her from the street
Panic

She scrambles behind a large planter

There is too much background for her to return fire
The van is rolling already Silas is in it He’s gone
Petra yells and rages at the receding van

DOWN THE STREET FAR AHEAD

One of the men fires wildly back toward the bank as he
Petra and another man are running up the street

Sirens now blocks away

Petra stumbles and hits the ground hard She cries out leg
giving way as she tries to get up

She crawls the men not slowing Back to her feet limping

Ahead in the distance red and blue flashing light bars
coming toward them

All three of them go around the corner

Bell is already running toward her car

INT CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Bell breathing rapidly keyed up

Radio traffic from responding units

She veers onto the side street looking for Petra

Far ahead the three are visible struggling to shed or
reverse jackets as they run

Bell weaves up the street to follow The three reach an
intersection cross

EXT STREET - SAME

The two men head down the street

Petra can’t keep up

glove torn by her fall

The metronomic beat continues

Ahead the men veer up some stairs into an unseen
establishment disappearing

Petra hesitates Sees something Splits off

Approaching the intersection Bell slows craning forward
looking

She sees Petra just as she enters a storefront

Bell passes the entrance turns into the alley behind the
buildings

INT COOL COAST CREAMERY - SAME

Petra walks into an ice cream place trying not to limp so
badly Very close on her her flat expression

A dozen tables Families A few girls around 14 years old
Two lines about three deep She joins one

A breath She shoulders her heavy bag She tries to fit in
Everything cool

In the line next to her a mother and a SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY
Close on the boy

He is looking at Petra Petra’s bare left knee is badly
wrecked and bleeding He looks at the bloody knee neutrally
Just observing

He looks up Petra glances down at him She advances in the
line toward the manager an African-American man in his

forties

Her bag hangs down by her side at his eye level The boy is
fascinated by her

She looks quickly over her shoulder Moving toward the
counter

Hand resting on her bag
Looking at the manager
Door opens It’s Bell coming toward Petra Glock 9 up

Never stopping--

BELL
Against the wall get against the
wall
Gasps and the start of confused sounds
Petra fumbles with her bag

Confused sounds all around as

PETRA BELL
Fuck you Against the wall

Petra one hand up reaches into her bag Bell closes shoves
Petra in the middle of her chest five feet into the wall

Her bag drops contents spilling across the floor
Bell covers Petra with her pistol

BELL
Hands on the wall now

But notices

The little boy is going to the wall right next to Petra--
obedient

On the floor bag spilled--
A heavy blued 357 revolver at the boy’s feet
Petra grabs the kid by the shirt sleeve

Bell closes in three steps and hits Petra in the face with
her gun Wet and heavy

PETRA
Ahhhh fuck

Bell grabs the boy by the shoulder throws him clear away
from them He tumbles and skids across the floor

The boy’s mother under a table scrambles out to pull him to
safety Now people are screaming

Petra hits Bell as she tries to control her A stream of
obscenities Bell hits her again Furious violence

A CUSTOMER grabs Bell from behind trying to separate them

CUSTOMER
Hey stop it stop

BELL
Get off me

Bell throws the man off Petra lunges drags Bell to the
floor Clawing at her all the way

On the tile floor Bell fends her off with her left hand
still hitting Petra with the gun in her right

PETRA
Piece of shit fuck you Erin

Terrified customers frozen Don’t know who is what

Petra gets up stomps Bell viciously in the chest and gut
with her heavy boot A sickening impact Petra tries to run
but Bell catches her foot and drags her back down

Bell hits her again

ACROSS THE ROOM

The mother and children try to leave As they open the door--

A cop running past shouts at them

RUNNING OFFICER
Stay in there

The mother backs away from the door More cops with long
guns run past Running up the street toward where Petra’s
accomplices disappeared

Bell hauls the bloodied Petra up

PETRA
Unnnhhh

Bell slams her against the wall

All eyes up at her scared Stuck in crouches halfway up
hands out or cowering under tables

Bell pushes the moaning Petra behind the counter toward the
kitchen

To the customers--

BELL
Lock that door stay inside

A teenage girl crawls to the front door to lock it To the
manager--

BELL
Keep them here
To the room-- an afterthought

to something The fight has gone out of her

Bell sits across from her Petra’s phone on the floor between

A pause

BELL

PETRA
You know you are not a very nice
person

Bell almost smiles

BELL
You live like this it’s your
choice Being here It’s all your
choice

Petra shrugs
PETRA

PETRA

She nods toward the bedroom

PETRA

Bell moves up slowly but instead of going to the bedroom

crouches over her Suddenly intimate face to face

BELL
No

PETRA
Come on help me out Erin

BELL
I’m not gonna give you that shit

PETRA
C’mere

Petra awkwardly strokes Bell’s hair with the back of her
hand An ambiguous gesture

PETRA
You came all this way to tell me
how disgusting I am

Bell stares at her like she’s trying to understand the
behavior of an animal Petra lunges snaps at her laughs

PETRA

Seeing you makes me think about

INT GANG HOUSE - BEDROOM - 17 YEARS AGO - DAY

Images of Chris and Bell like pictures falling apart

happened to him right

BELL

You’1l go on death row but I doubt

they’1ll get to you

PETRA
Youll get me a deal

BELL
That’s the idea

She looks away mouth moving a little-- like a conversation

happening with herself for a moment

PETRA
He was so sweet to me

A moment of curiosity on Bell’s face Petra’s eyes flicker up

at her noting it Continues

PETRA

I remember I told him I’m not

into kissing Chris wanted to

though I just wanted to go down on
him but he wanted to kiss It
freaked me out He kept pulling me
back up And then he was so gentle
when we fucked It was like I was
somebody else

Petra smiles wistfully as if this is the sweetest

story ever

Bell doesn’t react
Now Petra smirks still playing games

PETRA
I mean I think it was him

The phone buzzes Bell picks it up

BELL
Be real simple

Bell holds the phone to Petra’s ear close enough to monitor
the conversation

PETRA
Yeah No I know Okay I’1l
wait then I’ll see you

Nods to Bell who hangs up A jumble of emotions starting to
break through Petra Regret at the betrayal Relief

PETRA
There’ll be a text to say when and
where

Bell checks the battery charge on Petra’s phone Satisfied
pockets it

PETRA
You think you’re better than me but
you aren’t shit

BELL
It doesn’t matter

PETRA
You wanted to be one of us You
wanted the money just as bad You
just didn’t have the balls to take

BELL
But I am better than you

PETRA
That’s so important to you

A crooked smile

PETRA
You were a cop fuck you Doing
your job But you wanted it just
the same as me

Petra curls up on the floor

PETRA
Can you get the cops here soon

Bell nods and leaves her

He gets in his car She seems reluctant to let go Into the
strange silence

BELL

He starts the car but doesn’t move Stares ahead as if
forcing himself to swallow something He looks at her through
the open window--

over in exhaustion and pain We slowly close in She feels
her side her chest She hurts

CLOSE ON THE YOUNGER BELL

The work has taken its toll the role now reality She looks

Bell snatches her bag from the counter and makes her way back
through the store her glance shifting constantly

BELL
Sorry Sorry I’m on my way

CHRIS (0S)

The call ends Bell stands goes to the sink She looks in
the mirror trying to collect herself It’s no use

A deep breath She looks down at the pregnancy test sitting
on the sink-- TWO LINES are visible

A breath escapes her Another She starts to shudder It’s
hard to tell if she’s laughing or crying
EXT BA SELF STORAGE - DAY

A series of low bunkers beneath a split in the 101 Freeway in
Silverlake Above traffic courses by on either side

Bell drives along one of the bunkers stops halfway down

She gets out unlocks one of the units throwing open the
slim rolling metal door

She checks Petra’s phone to make sure she has service then
moves inside

INT STORAGE UNIT - CONTINUOUS

Bell navigates the tight space basically a double wide
closet which is stuffed with all sorts of detritus boxes
an old shelving unit an upended couch

At the back Bell pulls aside some boxes Notices something
alarm growing-- they are stained Rips aside an old blanket
also stained revealing a black military-style duffel Bell
heaves it up and over setting it down heavily on the floor
in front of her

She zips open the bag and we see the stacks of bills--

BELL
No

-- soaked in PURPLE DYE just like the one we saw earlier So
is the next one and the next

BELL
No no no
She claws her way through the bag confirming the worst
Most if not all of the money is tainted Useless She finds
the remnants of the exploded DYE PACK which must have
exploded after she put the duffel here years ago

BELL
Fuck

Bell throws a stack hard against the back wall She kicks out
at the bag in anguished rage

She sinks to her knees

We watch her looking at the ruined money that surrounds her
She starts to pick through the mess looking for clean bills
There aren’t many

She sits

Exhaustion and stress starting to crack through Bell’s face
She winces in pain Lost

OVER THIS the sound of a phone ringing and ringing
relentlessly No answer

That’s what I think it costs

He looks at her with contempt

BELL
You stay in Spokane You don’t come
back You don’t contact her again
Not a single text

JAY
She loves me you know We take
care of each other

BELL
I don’t care If you come back I’11
kill you
Silence
BELL

Itll be easy Because I don’t care
what happens to me

A pause as Jay processes Finally--

JAY
I don’t want to live in Spokane

BELL
I don’t give a fuck where you live
But if you contact Shelby again
even once I’11 kill you

Jay shakes his head muttering something

BELL
I’m terrified by how much I love my
daughter You should be too Take
the money

JAY
I should just to play you

BELL
Don’t make excuses for what you
want It’s weak

JAY
tell Shelby about this shit

BELL
You won’t do that

Jay looks out at the traffic on Hill Street trying to

swallow this desperate not to give her what she wants

suddenly he’s on his feet

But

JAY
Fine No one’s worth this shit You
better fucking send it

BELL
Don’t worry

JAY
She’s never going to love you you
know

BELL

She doesn’t have to
Jay looks her over one last time

JAY
Cunt

Bell stands Jay realizes his mistake girds himself But
Bell just walks away

BELL

I’1l go find a post office
INT BELL’S CAR - DUSK
Bell drives
She glances down at Petra’s phone
Nothing
The city washes over her through the windshield
We close in on her

Something approaching her that she can’t avoid

INT DESERT DINER - THE PAST - DAY
Chris and Bell look at each other rehearsing their story

CHRIS
We had no indication we were blown
We were sent to meet a dealer
contact they had

BELL
Name him Use a real one doesn’t
matter

CHRIS
Ok Tic Tac

BELL
We were sent to meet a dealer we
were familiar with whose street
name was Tic Tac

We begin to INTERCUT Chris and Bell rehearsing the moments
leading up to the crime

EXT GANG HOUSE - 17 YEARS AGO - DAY

off by herself Bell watches Petra as she along with Silas
and the others prepares Petra is arguing with Silas about
something-- Bell notices that Petra has left her open bag on
the ground a bit away Her cellphone is visible inside

Bell looks at Petra who is wrapped up in her argument then
at her watch Bell takes her cellphone calls “PETRA” on her
contact list Lets it ring holds for 10 seconds saying
nothing Ends the call Making a trail

INT DESERT DINER- THE PAST - CONTINUING
BELL

When he wasn’t there we called
Petra to tell her we were coming

back
CHRIS
She didn’t answer which was not
atypical
BELL
We returned to the house
CHRIS
No one was there We suspected
BELL
No We became concerned enough
that
CHRIS

We became concerned enough that we
went to two locations we knew they
were looking at

INT BELL’S VAN - 17 YEARS AGO - DAY
We see them pull on masks one by one in slow motion
The conversation at the diner INTERCUTS with this

BELL (VO)
While we were at the first-- the
jewel repository in the file-- they
were already hitting the second It
was over when we got there

CHRIS (VO)

We take full responsibility for
losing contact but

INT DESERT DINER - THE PAST - CONTINUING

Bell looks directly at Chris reciting the words without
emotion

BELL
There was no forewarning and we
believe we did nothing to cause
them to mistrust us

A moment

BELL
Okay

CHRIS
You’re a good fucking liar
INT BELL’S VAN - OUTSIDE THE BANK - 17 YEARS AGO - DAY
Outside the desert bank Bell and Chris look at each other
through the windows of their respective vans

That’s good We’ll be outside

BELL
Masks anyway

CHRIS

BELL
We do the after-action reports go
through the motions for a while
until it quiets down enough to
quit Then we’re gone

INT BELL’S VAN BANK PARKING LOT - 17 YEARS AGO - DAY

As Silas gets out of his van he sees Bell through her
windshield an unnerving half-smile as he pulls on his mask

Silas says something to Chris through the driver-side window
Chris gets out pulls a mask on He doesn’t look happy about
it A change of plan

Arturo takes Chris’ place behind the wheel

They move toward the bank Chris glances back through his
mask at Bell

CHRIS (VO)
Something goes wrong then what

BELL (VO)
We break cover call it in
ourselves Make arrests when
responders get there

CHRIS (VO)
We have to work that story out too
We say they took our phones we
made the first move we could

She watches him go inside

INT DESERT DINER - THE PAST - CONTINUING
On BELL certainty
BELL
Yes
INT BELL’S VAN BANK PARKING LOT - 17 YEARS AGO - DAY

She watches from the van as it starts to go down

Faster cuts

The chaos of memory and extreme emotion both what Bell can
see through the windows and her projection of what she can’t
INT BANK LOBBY - SAME

The images come

- They take control of the bank

- We focus on a young TELLER a girl probably just out of
high school She is shaking We follow her throughout this

always aware of where she is

- Gang members pull bags out of the vault

Employees shove money and other items into the bags
- Chris masked watches anxious

- The teller is crying as she loads the bags

- Petra stalks in front of the vault

PETRA
Come on come on

- The gang members leave with loaded duffels
Silas is the last to leave the bank To the teller

SILAS
No dye packs in here

She is too scared to respond

SILAS
It’s clean

He walks out the door

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

Bell watches them exit throwing bags in both vans
Toby gets into the passenger seat of hers

Silas comes out

The dye pack blows in one of the duffels

Purple mist fountaining out
On Chris halfway to the van
On Bell’s face

Silas still close to the door turns and walks back into the
bank

Chris turns decides

He runs toward the bank lifting his gun
He shouts something pulling off his mask
Identifying himself as FBI

Silas is already inside gun raised

In her van Bell reaches for the driver’s door handle to get
out

Feels Toby’s gun jammed into her neck

TOBY
The fuck The fuck

Chris is going through the door
AND THEN
137 SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE FROM INSIDE THE BANK 137
Silent and horrifying
Chris gets inside
Chris fires
Misses
The teller puts her hands out
Chris keeps coming
Chris and Silas both fire many shots
Chris falls
Silas turns the gun on the teller
Fires

Puts another bullet into Chris
A scream begins over this
But the scream isn’t coming from the footage
The person we are hearing screaming is Bell

Silas walks outside

INT BELL’S VAN - DAY

Sirens coming

Silas is picked up by the other van
Toby jabs his gun at her

SHELBY
So the worthless school shrink made
me do this thing Like poking
around looking for a “good” memory
from when I was a kid and I’m
like I don’t remember anything

Bell looks at her

SHELBY
Like nothing about being a little
kid It hasn’t even been that long

BELL
I don’t think I do either

SHELBY
Yeah I know You want me to be
grateful you didn’t burn me with
cigarettes or

BELL
All right

SHELBY
You know the one thing I remembered
with the shrink I don’t even know

maybe seven You came and got me
out of school early You said you
were taking me camping like a
surprise camping trip We went up
into the mountains And a bad
snowstorm came in We didn’t have
the right gear We got lost trying
to get back to the car Did that

happen
BELL
Of course it happened
SHELBY
How long were we lost
BELL
Overnight
SHELBY

You were messed up I knew
something was wrong with you
because I was looking at your
shoes They were just sneakers
They were so wet they were falling
apart

Bell nods Shelby fights to stay hard
SHELBY
It was dark and cold and you
know I felt I wasn’t scared
It’s so fucked up I felt safe
because I was with you I knew you
were strong and you would
protect me But at the same time

She shakes her head

SHELBY
Why were we out there

A tear goes down Bell’s face It surprises her

SHELBY
I kept saying that We shouldn’t be
here Why did you take us here

Bell wipes the tear away

SHELBY
We were out there all alone for no
reason Like a couple animals It
was cold I just said why You
didn’t answer me You couldn’t just
answer me I would have taken
anything But you don’t speak

BELL
I know what it’s like to grow up
mad

SHELBY
That’s not my fucking fault

BELL
I didn’t want that for you But I’m
mad I’m still so mad I thought it
burned something in my brain but
that’s just an excuse

It was my fault he died It was my
fault other people died

who’s bad Not you
Shelby looks away around uncomfortable
BELL
I’m sorry for lying to you I stole
and I lied and worse and my whole
life my whole life

SHELBY
What am I supposed to say

Bell shakes her head in unknown territory

BELL
You can be better than me

She gets up abruptly

SHELBY
What’s going on

BELL
I do love you

She leaves quickly kissing her on the forehead
We sit with Shelby for a moment

The sounds of mundane life in the diner On Shelby something
changing

Out of the window she can see her mother down the block
fidgeting at the corner waiting for the walk sign

Shelby watches her

Alone A potent frightening mess Her mother

Shelby starts to cry as surprised by tears as Erin was

The beginning of some kind of peace

Through the window Bell is walking then jogging across the
street

EXT STREET - NIGHT

We see Petra’s phone in Bell’s hand

The text has arrived

Bell reaches her car

She puts the phone away and gets into her car

EXT CITY STREET - EAST SIDE - NIGHT

We follow Bell’s car as it makes its way into the night

EXT BOWTIE PROJECT - LATE NIGHT

Bell’s car parks under an overpass A desolate park entrance
ahead

EXT BOWTIE PROJECT PARK - LATE NIGHT

Bell exits her car

She pulls on a jacket-- a pained expression--

She moves in the darkness across an empty gravel lot toward
an opening in the chain link fence

Her face hard almost completely shrouded in darkness
We walk with her

She goes through the fence down onto a dirt path that curls
around the river

Drawn forward by a dim fire on the path Next to it

A FIGURE barely visible crouches at the top of the
embankment taking things from a duffel bag and burning them

CLOSE ON THE DUFFEL-- we catch glimpses of a long-haired wig
some clothes
As the figure stands--

BELL (VO)
Silas

The figure straightens calmly raises his hands slowly
SILAS
That voice Petra’s not coming is

she

Carefully he turns coming into the light-- SILAS Older now
But the same wild glimmer in his eyes A hint of a smile

SILAS
You get what I sent you Wanted you
to know you didn’t get away
Coming full into the light we can see him

That his head is shaved

That he wears a red jacket just like the body from the
beginning

And on the back of his neck the tattoo we saw on the victim
Bell keeps walking toward him
She has a gun

It isn’t her service pistol but the revolver with a red tape-
wrapped grip

SILAS
You’re still mine

Bell FIRES

As the bullet hits Silas--

INT NORTHWEST DIVISION - BULLPEN - FLASHBACK - DAY

composure breaking He’s telling her the truth

SILAS

EXT BOWTIE PROJECT PARK - NIGHT - CONTINUING
Bell FIRES Again

She shoves a handful of marked bills into his chest as he
reels backwards fires again

Silas’ legs give way and he DROPS
He’s dead in the position we saw the body in the opening

Silas is the body He is the victim And Bell is the killer

We have been watching the plotting of a crime not its
investigation

Bell stands over his lifeless body for a long moment She
drops the gun near his body

BELL (VO)
What about if I know who did this
As Bell crouches down looking at the bills scattered around
him DISSOLVE TO--

INT BELL’S CAR - SAME

She tries to put her keys in the ignition
Fumbles them

Starts to reach to pick them up gives up

Sinks back into her seat

She pulls up her shirt

Chest and abdomen swollen and purple

Spreading darkness underneath internal bleeding
Very bad

Outside the skateboarder’s efforts catch her attention
She looks out the window

Her eyes flutter

CHRIS (VO)
It’s a bad idea

BELL (VO)
I’m tired Chris
EXT TACO SHACK - INDIO - DAY

The continuation of the conversation we saw earlier-- Bell is
vivid and alive in the resentment that has led her here

Until we can see nothing more of Bell

Until all we can see is Shelby’s face looking ahead
