girls school outfit -- white blouse dark blue tie

Annabelle fights back fiercely Hobbes has tears in his

The struggle takes them all over her apartment which
although sparsely furnished presents enough objects in

the other side Hobbes sinks to his knees before the
corpse and struggles to draw the scalpel through the

INT RENTAL OFFICE -- MORNING

Merrick and the Svibens sit across from each other at a

table strewn with floor plans and maps The river which
surrounds the complex can be seen through the glass

it over to Benda

INT TUDORS APARTMENT -- MORNING
In his bathroom Nicholas Tudor is cleaning his teeth
microscopic attention to detail using an elaborate

water device called a water-pick Tudor is thirty-nine

happy with his work as an insurance appraiser and has

as his primary mood

the machine away then leaves the bathroom

In the dining room Janine is putting breakfast on the
Tudor sits down without a word and begins to eat
returns to the kitchen and comes back with a cup of

INT A HALLWAY -- MORNING
Tudor leaves his apartment closing the door behind him
see the number clearly)

He walks down the hallway on automatic pilot obviously
preoccupied turning the corner leading to the

without perceiving what he is seeing

At the elevators he hesitates for a moment then
UP button When the door opens he steps in
INT ELEVATOR -- MORNING

In the elevator are Merrick the rental agent and the
Svibens

MERRICK
Were going up

TUDOR
Oh Well Ill go along for the ride

MERRICK

(after a pause to

the Svibens

indicating the

elevator)
Wood-grain paneling strong silent
fireproof fast cushioned ride
Everything you could want in an
elevator

Nobody says another word until the doors spring open
Merrick after a wink at Tudor hustles the Svibens out
the elevator
As the doors close Merricks voice floats back to

and removes a key from a zippered compartment

INT HALLWAY -- MORNING

Tudor fits the key into the lock of Annabelles

He knocks gently and then opens the door After a pause
steps in and closes the door behind him not wanting to
seen by anyone who might know him

INT ANNABELLES APARTMENT -- MORNING

As soon as he is inside the apartment Tudor knows that
something is seriously wrong Smoke hangs in the air

smell of burned flesh attacks Tudors nostrils He is
way to the bedroom when he sees Hobbess foot around
corner of the dining room

Tudor approaches the dining room with his hand over his
and mouth

Annabelles corpse is still smoking where it lies on
dining-room table Hobbess body is twisted into the
position at the foot of the table one hand still

the scalpel stuck in its neck the floor beneath it
with blood

Tudor winces as though stuck with a pin Blinking

he edges around the room until his angle of vision is
that he can see the head of the corpse on the table It
definitely Annabelle eyes still staring surgical clip
attached to her lips purple bruises on her neck

Tudor turns his body contracting around the pit of his

stagger from the apartment having at least enough

of mind to take his attach√© case which he left by the
and to close the door behind him

INT ANNABELLES APARTMENT -- AFTERNOON

Dr Roger St Luc tall thin dark not bad-looking
over the table staring at the corpse of Annabelle As
watches two ambulance men throw a sheet over her and
to lift her down on to a stretcher on the floor The
of the superintendent of the building drifts over to
from the other end of the apartment

SUPER (VO)
Like I said to the police officer
he paid the rent Dr Hobbes did
And he came around and chatted a lot
with everyone here the staff I
mean Nice guy Not a high and mighty
type But it was her name on the
residency list and the buzzer board
Annabelle what was it again
Annabelle Horsefield She never
complained about anything not to
me anyway

The super a small unshaven harassed little man with
of energy is talking to a large beefy detective who
everything down in a notebook

DETECTIVE
(pointing to
Annabelles corpse
which is just being
carried out the door)
And that was her Annabelle Horse
field

SUPER
Far as I know yeah that was her
The detective now turns to St Luc who is crouched on
the

floor examining the chalk outline around where Hobbess
body

had lain

DETECTIVE
Is that the man who called you up
here

SUPER
Yeah thats Dr St Luc Hes the
head of our little medical clinic
here

DETECTIVE
Medical clinic

SUPER
Yeah This is an island you know
Takes too long to get into the city
We gotta have everything right here
or somebody complains

DETECTIVE
Well lets go talk to your doctor

The detective walks over to St Luc and the super
follows

St Luc rises to meet him He is wearing very informal
summer

clothes a bit rumpled

DETECTIVE
Dr St Luc Detective-Sergeant
Heller Id like to ask you a few
questions

ST LUC
(obviously a bit dazed
by what he has been
seeing)
Sure

DETECTIVE
Youre the one who found the bodies

st LUC
Yes

DETECTIVE
Did you touch anything Move anything
before we got here

ST LUC
No nothing

DETECTIVE
You knew these people

st LUC
I knew the man Emil Hobbes a doctor
and a professor at university I saw
the girl around the building but I
didnt know her She never came to
the clinic

DETECTIVE
So you just came up to visit this
Hobbes and you found them like that

ST LUC
Oh no I havent seen Dr Hobbes
since I was in medical school He
taught me he was my prof in urology
and I think he conducted a few
seminars in psychopharmacology That
was it I had no idea hed ever set
foot in Starliner Towers until today

DETECTIVE
I see Then what brought you up here

St Luc begins to pace about as he talks

ST LUC
t was very strange He called me at
six this morning Hobbes called me
thought I was dreaming I havent
heard that voice for so long He
told me who it was then he said
something like Meet me at apartment
208 at noon I want you to go out
for lunch with me Its time you
furthered your education Then he
laughed and hung up I went back to
sleep He called me again at eight
to remind me to come

DETECTIVE
How did he sound this time Was he
nervous Depressed

st LUC
witha

probably

looks

grotesque
brown

to

own

Rollo

and
of
wood
are

lab

He sounded fine
The telephone rings The super who has been fiddling

window with a cracked pane of glass grabs the phone
instinctively without looking at the detective who

would have answered it himself
SUPER
(pause)
Who No thats not me You got the
wrong guy Just a sec
(looks up at St Luc
and holds out the
phone to him)
Its for you Somebody wants to know
how come you didnt show up for lunch
The detective looks suspiciously at St Luc who simply
dazed
INT ROLLO LINSKYS LABORATORY -- AFTERNOON
Next to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and
marine worm specimens lies a large parcel wrapped in

paper Rollos plump fingers eagerly open the package

reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and
accessories

Rollo offers some to St Luc while stuffing one in his

mouth There are Cokes and old coffees everywhere plus
mustard relish and ketchup dispensers of all kinds

and St Luc sit around Rollos desk a very sleek metal
affair

Rollos lab itself is a combination of modern office

biology room in a museum of natural history Specimens
all kinds in bottles and cases mounted on glass and
floating in preservative baths are everywhere There

also a few cages of living insects moldy aquaria and
which

discipline
microscopes
table

cabinet

his
general
jargon
phase he

to his

comment

all

cultures in various stages of neglect

There are also clippings from magazines and newspapers
sporting furious underlinings and circlings in red ink

are stuck to walls doors bookshelves

Despite the potential for chaos however there is an
underlying order which reflects Rollos own real

which is not always immediately apparent And the

and glass slides the stainless-steel gynecological
complete with stirrups metal drug and instrument
etc are spotless and in good shape

Rollo is rotund soft-faced and a manic-depressive In
manic phase he is a joker and an elbow-nudger and his
style even when discussing medical matters in medical
is broad North-American Jewish In his depressive
becomes a sullen kid who has an oddly sinister aspect
character

Rollo detaches himself from his baby beef in order to

on the food that not so secretly he loves best of

ROLLO

Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes
would have laid on you Rog but
its all I got and

(places hand on heart

leans over

confidentially)
all I got I share with you Go
ahead Take all you want

ST LUC
You touch my spleen Rollo
(they giggle at an
old medical-school
reference)
And here all the time I was thinking --
if I ever bothered to think about
the good old days -- well at least
theres Rollo Hes in VD and hes

happy

ROLLO
Im still a VD man under the skin
Rog You know me Im a down-to-earth
kinda guy right

ST LUC
Well at least you still talk the
same

ROLLO

So who changes

ST LUC
But you gave up your private practice
Suddenly youre into pure research

and you youre what a
parasitologist

ROLLO
That was my fathers idea private

practice He wanted to set me up --
I couldnt say no But hes dead
now And me Im still a snoop I
gotta do research Look at that
beautiful stuff

(gestures everywhere)
-lookit it

He jams a final piece of sandwich into his mouth and

jumps
to his feet smiling broadly
ROLLO
(with great enthusiasm
indicating the entire
lab)
This is the Satyrs Tongue
He pulls a book off a shelf with a bookmark in it He
opens
the book at the marked page and hands it to St Luc As
St
Luc looks at the picture of a satyr with his tongue
hanging
out and reads the brief note on how medieval alchemists
thought the ground-up tongue of the satyr could cure
any

disease Rollo continues to talk
ROLLO

The note includes a warning against
swallowing the tongue whole but we
dont see the rest of this caution
Satyrs Tongue was Hobbess code
name for our project What we were
trying to do was to find an
alternative to organ transplants

As Rollo speaks he walks all over the place picking

up and

discarding various charts specimens bottled and
diseased

human organs etc

As he moves around we catch glimpses of Letrasetted
signs

that Rollo has tacked up Sex is the invention of a
clever

venereal disease -- Hobbes Dr Hobbess
prescription

starve a fever feed an obsession The road of excess
leads

to knowledge plus several pictures of satyrs with
their

tongues sticking out being cut off by alchemists etc

ROLLO
I know Youre bored already
Transplants are yesterdays kishkas
right

ST LUC
(shaking his head in
protest)
Did I say anything

ROLLO

(excited waving

specimens of parasites

and diseased organs

around)
Look You got men you got parasites
that live in on and around men
Now Why not breed a parasite that
does something useful Eh Why not
breed a parasite capable of taking
over the function of any one of a
bunch of human organs Why not for
example a parasite living in the
human abdominal cavity that plugs
into the circulatory system and
filters the blood like a kidney If
it takes a little blood for itself
so what Be generous You can afford
it

He is now in full flight He leans over St Luc and
begins

to demonstrate what he says by drawing things on St
Lucs

stomach with his fingers St Luc cant hide his
amusement

ROLLO
You put the bug into the body of a
man with a diseased kidney the bug
attacks the bad kidney dissolves
it its assimilated by the body
and now you got a perfectly good
parasite where you used to have a
rotten kidney I know what youre
gonna say Youre gonna say its
crazy

st LUC
(laughing)
Its crazy

Rollo throws himself back into his chair and grabs a
pickle

ROLLO
Right Its crazy But heres the
beauty part Ready
(leans forward for
emphasis)
Who cares

ST LUC
I dont get it

ROLLO
You know and I know that Hobbes was
a lousy teacher eh Lousy Dry
academic afraid of women lousy
But he was always a genius at one
thing -- getting grants Could he
get grants for crazy projects

St Luc is about to say something but Rollo answers
his own
effectively

medical

shoves

sandwich at

St

jar

specimen

down

rhetorical question with a flip of the hand
silencing St Luc
ROLLO

You know who pays the rent here Eh
The Northern Hemisphere Organ
Transplant Society And thats for
something thats supposed to put
them outta business And theyre not
the only ones We got grant money
coming out of our ears

He leaps up again and pulls a sheaf of reprints from

journals like the Journal of Venereal Disease etc He

them under St Lucs nose then grabs a jar with a
disintegrating octopus-like creature in it anda

the same time He smacks down the sandwich in front of
Luc by mistake then retrieves it and substitutes the
with the specimen

St Luc sifts through the papers and glances at the

As St Luc looks at the papers Rollo breathes heavily

his neck and points out things of interest

ROLLO
See There You take a little of
this thats a very rare venereal

disease you get in the nomadic Crinua
people Northeast Asia and Japan
(points to a sexy
picture of a Japanese
lady in heat)
Oo That ones got it bad They call
it Batinh That means kiss or
caress When you get it it makes
your lips itchy ya wanta kiss
everything I even had it once I
always get everything at least once
so I know what the patients talking
about
(he laughs but hes
serious)
And there you take a little of

subdued
provokes

beginning

papers

sliding

that thats beautiful isnt it
Thats Flexipes the worlds only
cephalopod parasite

(indicating the jar)
Thats him right there Not a very
good specimen Related to squids and
octopuses See He lives in the guts
of whales and big dolphins

(wiggles a finger at

the specimen)
Ya like em big n hot n wet dont
ya Yeah

He walks away from the desk His manner is now more
and reflective It seems as though everything he says

a dozen unspoken thoughts His depressive phase is

ROLLO
We dont do it all here we send out
to have tricky stuff done the

cell fusion enucleation chromosomal
fission all that fancy close work

Rollo sighs heavily St Luc gently shoves all the
aside

ST LUC
Rollo how come Hobbes killed himself

Rollo toys with the gynecological examination table
the stirrups in and out on their adjustment bars

ROLLO
(shrugging)
Funny in the head High suicide rate
in the medical profession Too much
body alla time bodies bodies

He now gets close to St Luc putting an arm around his
shoulder

ROLLO
Rog I gotta talk serious to you
Really Listen Ya listening OK I
want you to come into this with me
To tell the honest-to-God truth Im
lonely
(begins to pace around

again)
All Hobbes ever did was run around
getting money and phone me in the
middle of the night He wanted you
in anyway Thats why we were gonna
get together the three of us We
would have enough to keep us going
for at least five years even with
inflation

ST LUC
(a bit uncomfortable
being put on the
spot)
Rollo you know me Once a GP always
a GP

ROLLO
(almost angrily)
You want to help sick people for the
rest of your life God forbid I should
talk you out of it

ST LUC
You oughta be careful yourself Might
end up cutting your throat

ROLLO
It was women did it to Hobbes
Couldnt handle them That girl
that Annabelle -- talk about crazy
projects

ST LUC
Who was she

ROLLO

(reluctant to talk)
Aw he met her when he was lecturing
at some private girls school They
caught him examining her little tits
for breast cancer in the faculty
lounge She was twelve Dont ask
It was craziness believe me

(indicating the

gynecological table)
They used to come here sometimes

(shakes his head)
Dont ask
end of

for

down

in the

behind

water-

tunelessly

He starts to run down like a spring-wound toy at the
its run He glances at a picture of Annabelle stuck in
corner which St Luc just notices for the first time
ROLLO
Ill never really understand how he
could do what he did to her
St Luc looks at his watch and gets up out of his chair
the first time
ST LUC
Well Rollo Linsky I gotta go
open up the store Its been great
to see you again
He moves toward the door Rollo trails after him head

obviously dejected

ROLLO
Yeah sure

They shake hands St Luc has to open the door himself
Rollo is really preoccupied Finally he looks St Luc
eye
ROLLO
But youll think about what I said

about working together huh

ST LUC
OK Ill think about it

Rollo manages a smile St Luc leaves closing the door
him

Janine waits for Tudor to say something else He

She catches a glimpse of Tudor rolling around on the
behind his desk his swivel chair tipped over on to its

the aging but sprightly Mr Parkins and Janine Tudor
who considers himself something of a ladies man is

to Janine when St Luc appears and looks at the list of
patients who have signed in

PARKINS
and this Kriedler seems to think
that mega-vitamin therapy may be the
answer to the question of aging
Thats not to suggest that the aging
process is in any way reversible --
I dont think for a minute that it
is -- but it may be stoppable and
thats where mega-vitamins come in

St Luc gestures to Janine to follow him into his
Janine gets up excusing herself to Mr Parkins

INT TUDORS APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON
Tudor enters his apartment and throws his jacket and
case on to a chair He loosens his tie and makes
drink then sits down on the sofa and switches on the
set
After only a short moment of relative calm Tudor
contracts into the fetal position spilling his drink
the floor He rolls on to the floor eyes staring out
head mouth opening and closing like that of a fish out
water tendons in his neck bulging with tension
He soon manages to struggle to his feet the primary
of pain apparently over He keeps both hands clamped

INT TUDORS LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
Tudor staggers into the living room from the bathroom
his mouth with a facecloth He sits down on a chair

the sliding glass door which leads to the apartments

He breathes heavily gasping for air His expression is
dazed one and he mumbles incoherently After a moments

he rises opens the glass door and steps out on to the
balcony

EXT TUDORS BALCONY -- NIGHT
Tudor hangs on to the railing of the narrow concrete

gulping down the air scanning the lights of the tower
opposite

Suddenly the muscles of his neck go tense again his
seems to gape open at the extreme limits imposed by

and jawbone his hands fly up to his mouth in an

keep down whatever is about to come up

Hanging over the railing of the balcony like an ocean
in a rough sea Tudor finally gives up the struggle and
on for dear life as he retches gags moans and
vomits

umbrella just off center as though it has been hit by
heavy blood-soaked sponge The force of the blow
twists the umbrella from the first ladys frail hand
she gives a little cry of surprise
Her companion extends a hand to help the first lady
balance then gives a slightly more startled cry when
sees the blood
The first lady examines her umbrella as well but does
react with such surprise
FIRST LADY
(examining the bloodied
umbrella)

Aw Poor birdie Theyre always

crashing into tall buildings Its

such a shame such a shame The

windows fool them you know
The creature the second parasite to emerge from
body lies in the grass away from the bright cones of
thrown by the towers lawn lamps We can barely make
bloody twitching form
Beyond the parasite is a basement window through which
visible a large laundry room complete with washers and
The window has been propped open a couple of inches by
of laundry soap
The first lady makes a move to find the injured
but her companion tightens her grip on the old ladys

COMPANION
Come along Olive

Oh Vi Maybe the poor things just

COMPANION

(pulling Olive along)
Dont be silly dear Its in heaven

muddle over it Now come along and

INT ST LUCS EXAMINATION ROOM -- NIGHT
St Luc is examining Mr Parkins Parkins sits on the
examination table with the hospital tunic on
St Luc presses gently around Parkins abdomen in the
area
of the navel
PARKINS
Ow Better take it easy Theres a
lot of pressure in there
St Luc stops pressing and takes up his stethoscope He
begins
to percuss the old mans abdomen
PARKINS
Want me to breathe deeply
ST LUC
Just breathe normally
St Luc finishes percussing removes the stethoscope
from

his ears and stands back thoughtfully
PARKINS
(confidentially)
Good shape for an old man eh

ST LUC
(after a pause)
Mr Parkins what makes you think
you caught these lumps of yours from
a young lady

PARKINS
She had a couple just like them
Right here near her belly button
You could push em around I thought
they were kinda sexy myself

ST LUC
Didnt she ever have these lumps
looked at by a doctor

PARKINS
(shrugs)
Didnt seem worried about them

ST LUC
Was this girl from Starliner Towers

PARKINS

Yep She lived in 1208 But we usually
went to my place Bigger liquor

serious)
She was gone when I got back from my
last Florida trip Too bad Had a

to find out exactly what youre hiding
in there OK Give them this The

Radiology

PARKINS
Gonna cut me open

ST LUC
Well lets wait for the X-rays

PARKINS

Used to know a doctor who said he

got to know his patients better than

their wives did

(chuckles)

Cutting a man open sure does expose

more of him than pulling down his

pants gotta admit that
St Luc smiles politely his mind obviously elsewhere
INT LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT
A bar of laundry soap props open the window of the
room The presence of the wounded parasite is indicated
by the glistening slime trail which streaks the section

with the occupant

INT BETTS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Janine enters Betts apartment Betts is sitting cross-
in leotards on the broadloom a number of very large

With some milk jugs I just happened

The first box she tries is empty She advances to the

trailing after her in admiration She stops at Tudors

INT TUDORS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Janine sits down in front of the TV set After a moment
two she gets up turns the set off and flops back down
the sofa with her Vogue

She doesnt notice a trail of bloody slime leading from
bedroom to the inside door of the milk box

In the bedroom a hand reaches down and pulls back a

to reveal a naked abdomen It is Tudors abdomen and
reaches out with trembling fingers to touch a lump the

of a chicken egg stretching the skin to one side of his

Tudor watches the lump in the muted light of his

gradually extends his hand toward the lump which
the instant its touched

TUDOR
(delirious voice
strained whispering)
Come here boy Here boy here

He taps and scratches the skin near his navel as

though
trying to lure a cat into attacking his fingers
He is propped up in bed sweating profusely half-
dressed
He looks weak and drained but still manages to smile
with
maniacal intensity his eyes wide and bright
TUDOR
Come on fella Thataboy You and
me were gonna be friends arent
we
We can now see that the sheets are twisted the pillows
half
off the bed Tudor begins drumming on his abdomen
Gradually cautiously the lump under Tudors skin
returns
He tries to seize the lump with his fingers and it
shrinks
back almost disappearing into his abdominal cavity
again
Tudor seems disappointed
TUDOR
No no no Dont run away boy Im
not going to hurt you Not going to
hurt you Were going to be friends
Friends
The lump returns again Gently Tudor begins stroking
it
The lump seems to respond by pulsing slightly the
rhythm

strangely masturbatory

set was on Nick must be home
She gets to her feet and walks to the bedroom
Inside the bedroom we see the door open Light floods
room as Janine enters Janine sees Tudor sprawled out
bed
JANINE

Nick I didnt know you were home

Whats wrong What are you doing

Youre almost falling out of bed

How are you feeling
Tudor twists around to see who has spoken eyes wide
unsmiling With the same motion he pulls the covers

his abdomen to hide the lumps from Janine

Janine stands at the bedroom door for an instant then
approaches the bedside She moves as though her hands

tied at her sides as though she is quite consciously
herself together
JANINE
(tenderly but with
caution as though
expecting a blow)
Nick does your stomach hurt Can I
see those bumps on your tummy can

She reaches out to pull back the covers again but he

away from her

St Luc is examining a very pretty young girl who sits

the examination table in a hospital tunic

st LUC
OK Dotty Everything else seems to
be fine Now if it gives you any
trouble at all any sharp pain any

me right away They can be tricky
sometimes

Dotty nods OK you can get dressed Were all through

The girl starts to get dressed St Luc scribbles

in her

office

file and then takes it with him into the

closing the door behind him

INT ST LUCS OFFICE -- NIGHT

St Luc sits at his desk and opens Parkins file

about twenty-three earthy and humorous comes in with

armful

to St

of papers and records which she throws in
Lucs desk
FORSYTHE

(distributing papers)
OK Roger Heres the stuff you
wanted Files on Horsefield Tudor
Swinburne and Velakofsky Papers
published by Hobbes Linsky and
Lefebvre in a couple of issues of

the Bulletin of the Canadian Medical
Association and also the Journal of
the American Medical Association
And as an added extra a couple of
odds and ends from the files I helped
compile before your time here Doctor
I thought they might interest you

ST LUC
Thats great Forsythe great Thanks

FORSYTHE
Do I get a kiss

St Luc is absorbed in his papers and doesnt respond
Forsythe prods his shoulder He looks up at her

FORSYTHE
Kiss kiss

ST LUC
Uh OK Sure

They kiss St Luc making sure that it doesnt get too
heavy

FORSYTHE
Another kiss

ST LUC

Rollo Howsa boy I was just thinking

about you
Realizing that the conversation is likely to be a long
Forsythe gets off the desk and walks over to a metal
in the corner which she opens
Inside are her street clothes She begins to take off
nurses uniform in full view of St Luc not being
about the distraction shes providing but not taking
to hurry dressing or be modest either
In the scene that follows we cut among three basic
Rollo in his lab talking and eating St Luc in his
watching Forsythe get undressed and then dressed and
notes and scribblings which do not necessarily have to
on the screen long enough to be completely read
notes are there more to convince the viewer that they
and to provide flavor than to transfer information

ST LUC

Been glancing at some of your

publications on your work with Hobbes
INT ROLLOS LAB -- NIGHT
In his lab Rollo sits at the gynecological table
by Hobbes Rollo is using it as an auxiliary desk
On the table are several opened waxed-paper packages of
knishes and accessories There are also several old

shoeboxes some still tied with string some opened and
overflowing with papers of all kinds Hobbess private
notes

ROLLO
(eating a knish)
Yeah well Im flattered but you
wont find any real meat in them

ST LUC (VO)
No How come

ROLLO

(shuffling papers)
Listen Rog I knew Hobbes was funny
you know I told you that But I
didnt really know just how funny he
was See when he kicked off they
sent all the personal secret stuff
they found to his mother -- shes
still alive but just barely -- and
she sent everything she thought was
medical to me here at the lab Im
Hobbess partner right

(laughs sardonically)
Anyway Ive been going through his
papers and what they add up to is
this Hobbes was shafting us all
me the university the foundations
and the councils the private labs
everybody We never really knew what
it was we were working on Hobbes
gave us each a few crumbs but he
was the only one who knew what the
whole loaf would look like

INT ST LUCS OFFICE -- NIGHT

St Luc watches as Forsythe rolls her stockings down
He

shuffles through Hobbess publications

ST LUC
OK I bite What does it look like

INT ROLLOS LAB -- NIGHT
ROLLO

It looks like -- and I quote -- a
disease to save man from his mind

ST LUC (VO)
I dont get it
ROLLO
Lemme clarify for you

Rollo pauses to wash down some knish with a can of
Coca-Cola

INT ST LUCS OFFICE -- NIGHT

Forsythe catches St Luc watching her dress and smiles
St
Luc swivels back to his files

INT ROLLOS LAB -- NIGHT

Rollo searches through Hobbess notes to find the
relevant

quotes As he does so he drops a few crumbs of knish
on the

page and his plump fingers brush the crumbs away
smearing

some meat over the words

ROLLO
Hobbes thought that man is an animal
that thinks too much an animal that
has lost touch with his instinct
his primal self in other words
too much brain and not enough guts
And what he came up with to help our
guts along was a human parasite that
is lemme find it here a
combination of aphrodisiac and
venereal disease a modern version
of the satyrs tongue

Rollo pauses and flips to a new note with the heading

ANNABELLE underlined in red She is becoming a new
creature

before my eyes It is like living at the Dawn of
Creation I

am euphoric I am in ecstasy

ROLLO
But the important thing for you is
this Hobbes used Annabelle as a
guinea pig He implanted her with
the thing I figure that once the
parasites took Annabelle went
berserk I dunno what she did but
Hobbes wasnt ready for it He had
to kill her And he wasnt trying to
burn her he was burning them all
of them

INT ST LUCS OFFICE -- NIGHT

St Luc watches Forsythe who is halfway through
getting her

street clothes on He toys with the Velakofsky file
which

contains abdominal X-rays showing dark blurred masses
inside

the abdominal cavity

ST LUC
He didnt make it

ROLLO (VO)
Huh

ST LUC
Maybe Hobbes didnt know it but
Annabelle was a pretty popular girl
around Starliner Towers Ive got
three men here maybe four whore
hosting large free-moving apparently
pathogenic abdominal growths that
nobody Ive tried can identify You
were next on my list

INT ROLLOS LAB -- NIGHT

ROLLO
Id kinda like to come over there
and have a look at one of these guys

ST LUC (VO)
Ive got a date with one of them at
ten Can you make it

ROLLO

Yeah

(pause)
Ah I dont want to panic you or
anything but I mean the way Hobbes
designed them theyre supposed to
get out of hand real quick so you
dont have much time to think about
whats happening to you Once they
decide to start pumping all those
dynamite juices into the old blood
stream I dunno But if you see
some people doing kind of compulsive
maybe even bizarre sexual things

ST LUC (VO)
(laughing he doesnt
take this aspect too
seriously)
Yeah What do I do then

ROLLO
I dunno Try tranquilizers Once you
can get at them theres a lotta
stuff you can use Ill bring a
bagful Its just the standard
tropical kit But the trick is to
get at them

INT ST LUCS OFFICE -- NIGHT

Forsythe has finished dressing and is waiting for St

Luc to
get off the phone
ST LUC
OK Its apartment 1009 South Tower
Starliner Towers May as well go
there directly
ROLLO (VO)
OK Rog See you at ten
St Luc hangs up
FORSYTHE

here anyway why dont you come up
to my place for a late supper
ST LUC
Meeting Rollo at Tudors Might take
a while

She leaves closing the door behind her St Luc
thoughtfully in his chair for a second or two then
back to his files
INT RECEPTION AREA -- NIGHT

Forsythe walks through the darkened and deserted

area to the elevators Through the main doors we see a
delivery van parked in the main driveway

INT MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT

A young man aged about twenty-five -- Kurt the

boy dark intense bearded his manner as stiff and
as the tuxedo that he wears -- rolls a restaurant

cart toward the main doors He has obviously just come

the van outside which is emblazoned with the words
Restaurant C√©te dAzur

The doorman smiles and opens the door for Kurt

lifts the cart slightly so that it clears the doormats

Elevator doors slide open and Kurt steps out pushing
cart He walks down the hallway looking for Bettss
After he has passed a few doors he approaches one which
slightly ajar

As Kurt approaches the door opens wider to reveal the
woman from the laundry room She is no longer wearing

dumpy laundry clothes however but is dressed in a
translucent nightgown and wears a grotesque amount of

up She is careful to keep half her face hidden behind
door

Kurt notices her but chooses to ignore her He is just
approaching her when she calls to him

OLD WOMAN
Im hungry

Kurt keeps on moving He is now just passing her door
old woman edges out from behind the door a bit more

OLD WOMAN
Im hungry

Kurt cant resist turning to look at her although he
moving When he looks her in the eye she eases out
from behind the door to reveal that half her face has
horribly burned by the laundry-room parasite the eye
shut the nostril drooping

Kurt is so stunned that he slows The old woman speaks

OLD WOMAN
Hungry for love Hungry for love

She suddenly reaches out and grabs Kurt by his tux with
hands and with tremendous energy jerks him back into

her

apartment and slams the door closed with a vicious
kick

Kurts cart remains out in the hallway the food
steaming

INT BETTS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

In her dining room Betts mixes herself a drink and
checks

her watch She takes a sip then goes into the bathroom
and

bends over the bathtub having balanced her drink on
the

edge of the tub

From inside the drain of the tub we see Betts place the
plug

in the plughole

Betts turns on the water adjusting the proportion of
hot to

cold until she gets it exactly the way she wants it
then

gets undressed

She wraps a thick and colorful towel around her and
goes out

to the living room with her drink in hand In the
living

room she arranges her photos in a new order props
them up

against the sofa changes them around again

Back in the bathroom Betts checks the temperature of
the

water by swishing her hand around in it The water
drums

heavily on the floor of the tub Betts puts her drink
on the

edge of the tub and turns the water off

She now drops her towel on to the bathmat and steps
into the

tub She reaches over the edge of the tub to straighten
her

sandals on the bathmat then picks up her drink and

Betts sinks down in the water until her hair short as
is begins to float a bit

The drain plug begins to jerk more and more violently
it is pushed right out of its plug hole The water

run out of the drain but only in a slight trickle --
drain pipe is blocked by a soft spongy body
Betts rolls her head back and forth across the back of

tub smiling relaxed enjoying the sensation

One of the parasites stubby tentacles slowly appears

out of the drain hole Then another appears then

Betts puts down her drink on the tubs edge and reaches
the soap and washcloth Her eyes are half-closed and a
still flickers about her lips The sound of water
rushing out of the drain in volume rouses Betts out of
reverie

She sits up and looks down toward the plug end of the
The parasite is crawling toward her up the middle of
tub almost touching her legs which are pressed
against one side of the tub The water is becoming pink
the blood that diffuses through it

Betts mouth opens slowly and her eyes are wide Her
are obviously being confused by the drinks she has

touch Bettss thighs

Betts tries to scream but cant The parasite suckers
way between Betts thighs She screams a silent scream
the tub her mouth wide open her head rolling from
side The only sounds are the thrashing of her legs in
water and the gurgle of the drain

With a spasm that shakes her whole body Betts throws
arms wide and knocks her glass off the edge of the tub
on to the tiles of the bathroom floor The glass

After a moment or two of further silent struggle Betts
her back then falls into a semi-conscious stupor
motionless in the tub

INT TUDORS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Nicholas Tudor lies flat on his back in bed on top of

covers The physical state of his face ghastly and
cadaverous is in sharp contrast to his expression

ecstatic beatific Madonna-like

Tudors hands rest on his abdomen in a posture often
associated with pregnant women Between his hands in

area around the navel three lumps shift beneath the
changing positions and pulsing rhythmically

As they move Tudor makes little delirious crooning
a parody of a lullaby

An old man and his wife the Spergazzis are taking
late-night constitutional through the halls of the
Tower
Their arms are linked and they both walk with the aid
canes the ultra-modern aluminum kind with four rubber-
prongs at the end
MR SPERGAZZI

Lovely lovely evening Very quiet

Mrs Spergazzi nods and smiles patting Mr Spergazzis
They round a corner which leads them down the stretch
hall which passes by Tudors door
As they approach Tudors door they notice a plastic
lying in the hall just below the open milk-chute door
Mrs Spergazzi detaches herself from her husband and
down with difficulty to pick up the jug

MRS SPERGAZZI

Eh the children in this apartment

theyre such little thieves You

have to put a lock on everything
She puts the jug back in the milk chute She notices
blood smeared on it just a second before the parasite

chute fastens itself to her wrist with its suckers

balance and he falls dragging his wife down with him
Mrs Spergazzi moans in pain and terror Her husband
to get to his knees and begins to smash at the thing
his cane White burning fluid begins to squirt

Mrs Spergazzis forearm begins to smoke bubble and
She becomes hysterical

Mr Spergazzi continues to smash away at the thing now
some success

INT FORSYTHES APARTMENT -- NIGHT

In the kitchen a thick paperbound book called Guide to
Gourmet Cooking lies open and face down on the kitchen

next to the sink There are a couple of pots and pans

Forsythe picks up the book then opens one of the pots

as though in anticipation of a meal Forsythe gets a
nervous

FORSYTHE

Kresimir approaches He is visibly shaking
KRESIMIR
(speaking with
difficulty)
Yes you can help me

Without warning he lunges for Forsythe who vainly
slam the door in his face Kresimir pushes his way past
door and grabs Forsythe by the back of the head trying
kiss her and drooling
Forsythe breaks away and runs toward the bathroom
to lock herself in Kresimir throws himself at her
managing to grab one of her feet She doesnt fall but
on to a cabinet and tries to pull free

INT BETTSS BATHROOM -- NIGHT
Betts lies slumped in her bathtub her hair matted and
her eyes open and staring Her mouth begins to work in
very sensual way and she begins to drool slightly
The tub is completely empty now except for the scum of
and soap The smashed glass is scattered all over the
near the base of the tub
Zombie-like Betts rises from the tub and steps out on
the floor her feet missing the bathmat The crunch and
of her bare feet on the broken glass are heightened
by the tiled echo chamber of the bathroom
The steps Betts takes toward the medicine cabinet leave
prints on the floor
Betts takes out various bottles and plastic cases and
from the medicine cabinet and begins to apply make-up

INT ST LUCS OFFICE -- NIGHT
St Luc is reading a section of one of Hobbess medical

in preparation for examining Tudor later on The

see says thus the theoretical organism we are now

considering would exhibit what I choose to call

evolution This in effect means that each generation

said organism would be better adapted to inhabit and to
control the behavior of its host

Suddenly Forsythe bursts in out of breath semi-
tearful

St Luc rises from his chair and Forsythe throws
him sobbing

ST LUC
Forsythe Forsythe Whats wrong

St Luc hugs Forsythe for a moment then holds her away
him so that he can get some information out of her

ST LUC

Inside a descending elevator a middle-aged woman and
teen-aged daughter flip through a magazine together

Its not their floor

The doors slide open Nobody seems to be waiting The

steps and opens the steel door at the bottom which

the incinerator room

Once inside St Luc grabs the poker hanging from an
hook sunk into the wall of the incinerator slides open
bolt on the door and opens it

He begins to probe around inside the incinerator oven

superintendents flashlight stuck up on top of a
pipe St Luc takes down the flashlight switches it

continues his search for the dead parasite
INT TUDORS APARTMENT -- NIGHT
Tudor lies on top of Janine on their bed Over his
shoulder
Janines face is visible eyes wide open and full of
tears
She tries to push Tudor away but he resists
JANINE
(frantically)
No no Nick please Stop Lets

Tudor pulls her back to him and finally she is forced
to
batter him away with her fists and slip off the edge of
the
bed Tudor glares after her
TUDOR
(in a mechanical whine)
Make love to me make love to me

JANINE
(trying to buy time)

Tudors eyes are staring right out of his head and his
mouth
is wide open He gasps for breath He stares at Janine

Suddenly Tudor wails terribly like a hound from the
bedroom

TUDOR
(heart-rending wail)
O0000000000000000
Janine turns to the door turns back to the lenses
both lenses out into her hand begins to squirt
them She has decided to try to ignore Tudor
TUDOR
(wailing)

Janine Janine Janinnnnnneeee

Janine can no longer pretend that she doesnt hear him
Closing her hand around the two lenses she runs out of

bathroom
Tudor lies outstretched on the bed in the darkness His
move silently spasmically as though in sleep

an abnormal insect fashion There is a swelling in his
throat almost as though he has developed a goiter

swells and contracts rhythmically
Janine appears in the doorway

Janine sighs deeply trying not to panic Her eyes
suddenly -- she hasnt got her lenses in and her gaze

There is a bit of black something a thread in the

of Tudors mouth Janine moves closer to it The black
like the tip of an insects leg twitches

Janine reaches out to brush the thing off Tudors lip
her fingers brush by the leg twitches back inside

Janine jerks back in horror her hands balled into

Gradually the thread reappears Tudors lips part

to allow the emergence of the dark viscous tentacle to
the thread -- a hook used to hang on inside the body --
attached The tentacle of the blood parasite probes its
from between Tudors lips

Janine is paralyzed with horror

The tentacle is now touching Tudors chin his cheek
tip of his nose

Janines fists tighten even more A glassy snap breaks

She tries to control the hysteria welling up inside
eases herself carefully over the side of the bed as the
stubby tentacle is joined by another and another She

a fraction of an inch at a time almost hypnotized by
movement of the tentacles

The hooks of the tentacles are now set into Tudors
cheeks and the tentacles draw taut as something

draw itself out of his body His throat bulges his
swell as the tentacles contract His lips are gradually
apart as the quivering moist shape emerges His mouth
opened to jaw-breaking width as the creature slowly
itself to the dim light of the bedroom

Janines eyes are wide with terror She utters a

cry and runs stumbling from the bedroom She dashes
the living room and reaches the door to the hallway

whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the
doorknob finally managing to swing the door open

Spergazzi hard of hearing doesnt notice The scream

followed by bangs crashes and insane laughter and

Screams and crashes follow

Mrs Spergazzi is getting hysterical Mr Spergazzi is
to calm her down by getting her to sit in front of the

and presses her lips savagely against Janines
She holds Janines head firmly as they kiss Janine
for a moment then opens her mouth as well
Her eyes are closed in passion then suddenly open wide

and takes the stairway up preferring to walk

The intercom squawks and Spergazzi answers the buzzer
MR SPERGAZZI
Yes Who is there

Its Dr St Luc Mr Spergazzi Let
me speak to the nurse please

MR SPERGAZZI (VO)
Oh but the nurse she went away I

St Luc curses under his breath and makes a move toward

the
door Merrick smiles and pulls it open for him St Luc
disappears down the stairs leading to the incinerator
As the stairway doors close the elevators slide open
and a

young couple come out heading for the main doors
dressed to
go out to a late party

Before they reach the doors Merrick slips through them
and

meets the couple in the lobby He smiles broadly as he

approaches them

MERRICK

INT GARAGE -- NIGHT

Finding herself in the underground garage Forsythe

to get in her car and drive out She finds her car -- a
or Toyota -- gets in throws the doctors bag in the

and drives up the ramp leading to the sliding garage

The car rolls over the cable which normally activates
doors but nothing happens Forsythe puts the car in
and backs over the cable but still nothing happens

St Luc races through the garage trying to find

He finally sees her car in the middle of the exit ramp
runs over to it

The doorman is still on top of Forsythe in the front
the car St Luc pulls the doormans gun out of its

and begins smashing away at the doorman with it

The doorman pounds St Luc in the temple with his fist
lifts himself partially off Forsythe half turning

St Luc who is staggered by the blow

The doormans face is covered with blood and drool

and terrified St Luc fires the gun into the doormans

body three times heedless of the possibility that he

hit Forsythe The doorman slumps over Forsythe

backs up peeling rubber to the base of the ramp He

toward the garage door

Another car full of residents suddenly careens in front
the door and screeches to a halt blocking St Luc who
swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a

post He picks up the gun from the console between the
and opening the car door empties the gun at the

who are emerging from their car

One of the residents falls back into the car blocking
other two

St Luc drags Forsythe out of the car throws her over

shoulder and carries her down the ramp toward the door
leading to the incinerator

The door to the gym opens and St Luc looks in

The gym is quite tiny and is deserted St Luc pulls

in and closes the door He lays Forsythe down on a gym
and then barricades the door with a box horse and a
lifting table

He kneels beside Forsythe who seems to be only just
consciousness St Luc strokes her face pushes strands

hair matted with blood out of her eyes

ST LUC

Forsythe)

Rollo enters and closes the door behind him
slamming it He walks into the center of the living
bellows
ROLLO

Hello good evening is anybody here

Dr St Luc Its Dr Linsky here to

see you for consultation
Still no answer Rollo is puzzled He snoops around the

apartment until he finds the bedroom with its door half
closed He pushes gently on the door and opens it

ROLLO
Its Dr Linsky Anybody home
Rollo can now see the figure of Tudor lying in bed in
dim light of the bedroom Rollo enters the bedroom
ROLLO
Is that Mr Nicholas Tudor Its Dr
Linsky Im meeting Dr St Luc here
He must be a little bit late
Tudor does not answer does not move He lies stiffly
bed on his back mouth insanely agape eyes shut
half on the floor
ROLLO
Is anyone here Nicholas Tudor Is
that you Tudor Mind if I have a
look at you
He stands at the edge of the bed peering at Tudor
for signs of consciousness After a pause he kneels on
bed and slowly draws back the covers

Tudors abdomen is gradually exposed as the covers are

blood parasites which sits poised for only a fraction

second before it springs at Rollos face with great

As the thing hits Rollos face it locks on to his head
entangling its stubby tentacles in his hair and

its suckers to his cheeks and chin

Rollo tries to stand then staggers and falls The
tries to force its way into Rollos mouth cutting his
in the process They bleed furiously When Rollo

pull a sucker away a piece of his flesh comes with it
As he writhes on the carpeted floor two more parasites
crawling toward him from under the bed covered with
from the floor They clamber on to him and fasten on to
face suckering on to his ears his throat forehead
One of them begins to ooze corrosive fluid on to his
Rollo screams in pain

He manages to roll to his feet He staggers out of the
darkness of the bedroom into the living room one arm
extended groping like a blind man the three parasites
locked on to his face They try to pull his lips apart
he keeps his teeth firmly clenched to keep them from
their way into the depths of his body

He takes a few unbalanced steps toward the kitchen

In the bedroom Tudors eyes snap open His head rises

He swings his legs over the side of the bed and ashen

TUDOR

Then as though listening to himself and suddenly
understanding what he is saying he rises to his feet

and walks to the kitchen He stops at the kitchen door
Rollo has torn the parasites from his face and is
away at them in the kitchen sink The parasites wriggle
curl in their own blood in the sink as he smashes away
them with the pliers
Tudor staggers toward Rollo
TUDOR

INT GYM -- NIGHT

Forsythe finally opens her eyes She smiles at St Luc
hovers anxiously over her as she lies on the gym mat

ST LUC
Can you walk I couldnt find anything
wrong with you

Forsythe nods and manages to sit up with St Lucs
Once she seems able to stay propped up without St
help he gets up and begins to move the barricade away
the door

ST LUC
Rollo and the police should be here
by now Its just a question of
avoiding infected residents until we
find them

St Luc comes back to Forsythe and kneels beside her

STLUC
OK Ready to go

Forsythe puts her arm around St Lucs neck as though
support Instead she draws him down toward her and
to babble in a strange casual dreamy way

FORSYTHE
Sometimes I have a recurrent dream
Have I ever told you about it
darling I guess you could call ita
Freudian dream because in this dream
I find myself making love to Sigmund
Freud But Im having trouble because
hes old and dying and he smells
bad and I find him repulsive And
then he tells me that everything is
erotic everything is sexual you
know what I mean He has a very thick
accent but I can understand him
perfectly He tells me that even old
flesh is erotic flesh that disease

is the love of two alien kinds of
creatures for each other that dying
is an act of eroticism that even
chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy
and longing That breathing is sexual
that talking is sexual that just to

physically exist is sexual And I
believe him and we make love
beautifully

While she talks Forsythe gradually slips her arms

around

St Lucs neck and brings her lips closer and closer to
his

St Luc mesmerized by the hypnotic drone of her words
is

about to kiss her Suddenly her mouth snaps open wide
with

mechanical precision her head tilts back her eyes
flick

closed

St Luc stares at her in horror as her throat begins to
swell

In the depths of Forsythes mouth two parasite
tentacles

probe about seeking a firm hold for their suckers so
that

they can pull the parasites body out of her narrow
esophagus

St Luc hesitates only for an instant then rips a
strip

from her blouse balls it up and shoves it into her
mouth

Holding her while she struggles to remove it he rips
off a

second strip and ties it around her head to keep the
gag in

St Luc rises throws Forsythe over his shoulder and
begins

to step toward the door of the gym

Dangling over St Lucs shoulder Forsythe struggles
moans

and howls as best she can St Luc manages to pin her
hands

to her sides so that she cant pull the gag out

St Luc rushes at the woman knocking her over

the floor hugging herself and crooning

Once out the door St Luc makes for the nearest exit

INT STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

As St Luc begins to ascend the stairs we can see tiny
hooks tearing through Forsythes gag Blood begins to
through from the inside

A group of residents suddenly appear at the next

above St Luc and

noticing them begin to walk down

steps moaning and crooning and making vaguely sexual
toward the pair

Blood is now pouring from Forsythes mouth and
groping for leverage at her cheeks and chin

St Luc decides to attempt to shoulder his way up the

certain that Rollo and the police must be at the main

As he hits the residents on the stairs they try to

him caress him pull his clothes off They finally

to drag Forsythe from his shoulders almost unbalancing
as they do so St Luc tries to prop her up on her

St Luc lets go of Forsythe and she sinks to the floor

residents are swarming all over them St Luc abandons
Forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs

He runs higher and higher up flight after flight of
until he is free of the slow-moving residents He leans
against a wall panting

Crooning and moaning echo up to him from below He

over the railing and looks down

In the stairwell several flights below Forsythe lies
surrounded by milling residents legs spread as though

to give birth A resident leans over and pulls the
from her mouth then swallows it whole with gusto

residents touch her stroke her caress her as though
offering her a strange kind of comfort

St Luc reels with disgust and disbelief He turns and

INT STARLINER TOWERS UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- NIGHT

The vast and dimly lit garage is full of silent cars
Somewhere an engine starts up then another and

until the whole garage is full of fumes and the revving
engines

As we prowl amongst the cars we find many of the

we already know now dressed to the teeth in their
best

Mr Spergazzi and his wife stand and watch the

canes in hand with great dignity With them stand

who are too old or too young to go into the night

for new hosts for their parasites content to remain
incubators for the time being

The residents are full of bubbly anticipation in their

EXT STARLINER TOWERS -- NIGHT
The garage doors slide open One car surges up the ramp
of all the others stopping at the top
The driver of this first car is St Luc sleek and
a raised collar and a scarf hiding most of his scars
glances into his rear-view mirror
In the rear-view mirror St Luc sees all the other
lining up behind him lights blazing
St Luc smiles then steps on the accelerator His car
out into the street
As St Lucs car turns on to the street car after car
him We rise higher and higher above the Starliner
apartment complex until the cars are a small stream of

far below bleeding into the main body of the neon-lit
metropolis
