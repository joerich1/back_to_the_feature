EXT A SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

THE BEDROOM WINDOW of a small bungalow casts a warm light on
the lawn in front through lace curtains

Across the street a battered van is parked Inside -

A DARK FIGURE dressed in black watches the bright window
The light switches out Someone has gone to bed

The Dark Figure grabs -

A NEWSPAPER off the seat next to him He folds it slides it
into a plastic sleeve and snaps a rubber band around it

He slips out of his van and sneaks along a row of bushes
toward the little house staying in the shadows

He places the newspaper carefully on the front porch

A BLUE VOLKSWAGON ‘BUG’ is parked on the street in front of
the house The Dark Figure approaches it carrying -

A GASOLINE CAN and a baker’s measuring cup

He dispenses one cup of gasoline and carefully pours it into
the Volkswagons gas tank

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out -

A PAIR OF SCISSORS with long sharp blades He approaches
the little house

Halfway there he drops to his hands and knees and starts
SNIPPING the top inch off the grass painstakingly mowing the
lawn by hand

A car door SLAMS The Neighbor a young guy in a bowling
shirt walks toward the house next door He notices the Dark
Figure clipping the grass

NEIGHBOR
Hey Marlin

The Dark Figure looks up He is MARLIN WHITMORE 55 with a
weather-beaten but kindly face

Marlin puts a finger to his lips cautioning the Neighbor to
be quiet The Neighbor offers a ‘thumbs up’ - they have done
this before

The Little Girl stares trying to hear him through the glass

LITTLE GIRL

Mom that man is talking to the
walrus

What’s he saying

MOTHER

I have no idea

EXT INSIDE THE WALRUS COVE - DAY

Henry hands the Walrus a mackerel and glares angrily

HENRY

You ruined my life

The Walrus opens his whiskery mouth for another fish

HENRY (cont’d)

What you did is unforgivable You
are incredibly selfish You smell
you are overweight and you have no
personality You are a greedy
disgusting pig of the sea and the
very thought of you makes me ill
The Walrus devours more fish

HENRY (cont’d)
I hope you get struck by lightning
and die before the afternoon
feeding

Henry tosses the last mackerel to the Walrus and turns to go
The Walrus makes a sound like URK It wants something else

HENRY (cont’d)
No

Henry takes another step for the door The Walrus URKS

HENRY (cont’d)
Absolutely not

Henry grabs the door handle The Walrus ROARS shaking the
whole fiberglass cove

HENRY (cont’d)
All right Fine

He turns and walks back to the Walrus which lowers its head
demurely Henry kisses it on its leathery brow then leaves
The Walrus satisfied lies down for a nap

EXT THE SEA OTTER POND - DAY

Henry feeds whole crabs to the sea otters which frolic like
stuffed animals come to life They grab their dinner with
both paws and eat it off their chests floating on their
backs They are adorable

A CROWD presses against the railing enthralled

Henry notices -

SUE 29 among the spectators She is pretty with a
slightly sad air She wears a waitress uniform She seems
to be looking at him

He smiles politely tosses another crab then looks up to see
Sue continuing to stare at him

SUE
You don’t remember me do you

Henry looks confused
SUE (contd)
Garfield High School Miss
Brixton’s math class

Henry looks at her name tag “Sue”
HENRY
Sue Not Susan Davis But weren’t
you

SUE
Fat Yup

HENRY

I guess we’ve both changed a lot

I was such a freak then How did

you recognize me
Sue flattens his crazy hair It springs back up
Henry offers her a crab

HENRY (cont’d)
Want to try

Sue accepts the crab and reaches down with it An otter
paddles over and takes it gently from her hand She laughs

HENRY (cont’d)
You’re good at this

SUE
Thanks I like animals

HENRY
What’s your favorite here

SUE
The sea turtles

He studies her thinking

HENRY
Do you like big animals

INT AN ACCESS CORRIDOR - DAY

Henry leads Sue along a narrow corridor into -

THE WALRUS COVE Sue finds herself face-to-face with the
huge beast no barrier between them only a yard away The

Walrus galumphs toward her

Sue gasps and darts for the safety of the corridor bumping
into Henry She grabs him alarmed

SUE
Oh my God It’s huge

Henry chuckles then frowns as -

SUE wrinkles her nose and backs away from him
HENRY
Sorry The smell comes with the
job
Sue looks nervously back toward the walrus cove where -

THE WALRUS pokes his head around curiously

SUE
I’m not feeding that thing

HENRY
I need your help It’s a desperate
situation

SUE

He looks fine

HENRY
Desperate for me Not him

Sue crosses her arms and listens curious

HENRY (cont’d)
This was just going to be my summer
job after college But then a zoo
in Alaska sent him down He was
badly injured We all thought he
would die But I stayed with him
around the clock and I talked to
him and I made him squid
milkshakes He started to eat a
little We bonded Soon he was
completely recovered But then
when I quit my job and left he
wouldn’t accept food from anyone
else

SUE
He wouldn’t eat

HENRY
He went on hunger strike After
three weeks they put him on an IV
He was close to dying again He
kept saying BLAAAAGH

SUE
What’s that

HENRY
He only says it around me I think
it’s my name

SUE
(touched)
Oh Wow
HENRY
So I came back to work here What
else could I do That was eight
years ago

Sue looks into Henry’s eyes and slowly smiles
INT THE WALRUS COVE - DAY
Just as before Henry offers the Walrus a mackerel He
gobbles it up Sue takes a fish and tries The Walrus
refuses it with an impatient toss of his head
Sue tries again with a different fish
SUE

Oh please It’s so delicious

Mmmm Yum
The Walrus SPLASHES into his pond and sinks from sight

Henry looks at the swirling water depressed

HENRY
Don’t take it personally

SUE
So how long will you be stuck here
How long do they live

HENRY

Sixty years Average
SUE

Oh
HENRY

But I have a plan to get on with my
life Anyway it was good to meet
you Thanks for trying

SUE
What’s the plan

Henry gestures for the door
HENRY
This is the way out You can wash
your hands outside
Sue turns around in the narrow corridor cutting him off
SUE

I’m not leaving until you tell me
your plan
HENRY
It’s not that interesting

SUE
It is to me Now that I’ve met you
again

Henry brightens They smile at each other But then his

good cheer vanishes

HENRY
I’ll have to tell you sometime

He tries to wriggle past her She blocks his exit

SUE
What’s the plan

Henry sighs He’s trapped He shifts uncomfortably

HENRY
I’ve been building a boat When
it’s done I’m going to put all this
behind me and sail around the world
and see everything

SUE
But what about

HENRY
He’ll eat or die It’s up to him

Sue’s expression hardens

SUE
So if I understand this correctly
while you are lounging on your
sailboat in Tahiti sipping pifia
coladas the walrus who you bonded
with who you nurtured back to
health who loves you like a child
loves its mother will be back here
starving to death abandoned
calling out your name with no one
to hear it Is that the plan

HENRY
(weakly)
That’s the plan

Sue looks at him then turns and leaves without a word

With a SPLOOSH the Walrus’ head pops up to the surface

blinks its eyes at Henry

Henry clenches his fist at it

It
EXT AQUARIUM DOCKS - DAY

Utility boats bearing the Aquarium’s logo line the docks
Henry walks down among them carrying a lunchbox and hops
off the dock into -

A TINY DINGHY tucked in among the larger boats He REVS its
little outboard motor unties from the dock and motors out
across the Sound revealing -

“TITANIC” painted on its stern
EXT OLSSON’S BOAT YARD - DAY
Henry in his dinghy approaches -

OLSSON’S BOAT YARD close to downtown Olsson’s caters to
tugs and work boats but a few sailboats and motor yachts
share the dock space

Henry pulls up behind a beautiful wooden sailboat a sloop in
a classic design with a white strip-plank hull The hardwood
decks mast cabin and trim have been lovingly finished and
varnished Henry scrambles aboard with a practiced motion
He lifts the hatch to the cockpit which turns out to be -

A PIANO LID The hatchway is constructed from a recycled
piano cleverly incorporated into the woodwork

Henry tosses his jacket below sets down his lunch box and
begins varnishing the deck As he works he grabs bites of
his sandwich

THE DECK is what you would expect it to be - hardwood planks -
but it is painted with basketball court graphics The deck
is recycled also

Henry carefully applies varnish to -

THE POSTS supporting the side rail which are made from the
colorful handles of croquet mallets On closer inspection
Henry’s entire boat is an ingenious construction of found
objects

OTTO (0S)
Hey

Henry looks up at -

THE MASSIVE MOTOR YACHT moored next to his graceful boat
The yacht is fiberglass fitted with all the latest gadgets
and looks fresh from the factory On its foredeck stands -

OTTO PRICEMAN 50 short plump and balding Despite his
Hawaiian shirt he looks like a businessman who succeeds at
everything but relaxation A bikini-clad Babe half his age
suns in a deck chair He waves a beer
OTTO (contd)
Cold beer

Henry groans to himself but he can’t resist

HENRY
Sure Otto Come on over

As Henry continues his varnishing Otto scrambles onto the
sailboat breathing heavily from the exertion Otto squints
at Henry’s handiwork

OTTO
If you used a camel’s hair brush
you wouldn’t get those streak
marks

HENRY
I just buff the marks down

OTTO’S VOICE
And a better grade of varnish
wouldn’t need so many coats

Henry grabs the beer from Otto and takes a long gulp

HENRY
A better grade of beer would make
your suggestions more tolerable

OTTO
Captains of industry hang on my
suggestions

Henry nods up at the Bikini Babe

HENRY
Is she one of them

OTTO
Shes a captainette

HENRY

How do you do it Otto You look
like a fire hydrant What gives
you the guts to approach a woman
like that Or do you just walk up
and say ‘Hi I’m Otto and I own a
million dollar yacht and several
large corporations’

OTTO
That is word for word exactly what
I say

Henry sighs and drinks more beer

OTTO (contd)
You could try something like ‘Hi
I’m Henry and I built a beautiful
sailboat but I have to empty the
boatyard’s garbage dumpster in
exchange for mooring space and my
varnish has streak marks’

HENRY
Should I mention how my view is
blocked by an overpriced tanning
bed

OTTO
That thing can go fifty knots
straight into a hurricane and the
billiards table stays level

HENRY
How would you know You never
leave the dock

OTTO
Leave the dock And cut off my
internet connection

Henry looks at him in disbelief
INT HENRY’S SAILBOAT - NIGHT

Henry tired enters his little cabin and opens a tin of
sardines and box of crackers He flips through a travel
magazine finding -

A PHOTO of a gorgeous smiling Tahitian couple in grass
skirts on a snow-white beach circled by turquoise water
Henry RIPS the photo out and lifts it up to -

THE WALL of his tiny kitchen which is covered with a map of
the world A line stretches from Seattle down along the West
Coast of the USA to Mexico then out to Hawaii and the South
Pacific Along the way the line’s journey is illustrated by
photos of beaches and mountains

Henry is about to tape his new photo up next to Tahiti when
he hesitates then RIPS the man out of the photo and tapes up
just the smiling island woman

EXT SEATTLE AQUARIUM - WALRUS PEN - DAY

The next day Henry feeds the Walrus and kisses it

HENRY
Don’t forget to floss

The Walrus looks lovingly after him as he leaves

EXT AQUARIUM DOCKS - DAY

Henry hops into his little dinghy and yanks on the outboard
motor starter But this time it just RATTLES without
starting He yanks again and it JAMS broken smoking

He glances at his watch in frustration then looks around
wondering what to do

EXT OUTSIDE MISS PEARL’S - DAY

Henry approaches -

“MISS PEARL’S BREAKFAST NOOK” a cozy little waterfront
restaurant As Henry checks it out he notices -

PATTY 45 a plump waitress standing in an alley behind the
diner singing a VERDI ARIA at the top of her lungs Her
operatic voice echoes off the bricks

INT MISS PEARL’S - DAY

Henry enters seeing comfortable-looking Regulars enjoying
classic American breakfasts

SUE approaches Henry with a menu then recognizes him

SUE
Hi

Her nose wrinkles when she gets close to him

HENRY
Oh I didn’t know you worked here
I mean I didn’t come here toI
mean honestly I just wanted some
breakfast

Sue is amused by his awkwardness

SUE
You came to the right place We
have breakfast

She leads him to a window table and hands him a menu He
scans it then notices -—

A PORTRAIT on the wall of the scowling Miss Pearl a stern-
faced matron of 60 with her arms crossed over her ample
bosom She clutches a rolling pin and a whisk like weapons
The plaque beneath reads “Our Founder”

SUE (contd)
If you don’t finish your toast she
comes back from the grave and
whacks you with her rolling pin

HENRY
Ill have the pancake combo Hold
the toast

Sue heads for the kitchen

Henry reaches for an abandoned newspaper at a nearby table
but his attention is distracted by -

LUCY 28 sitting by herself two tables away She is lovely
with flowing dark hair She wears a tan shirt with an oak
leaf print She reads a novel with intense concentration

As Henry watches she heaves a big SIGH tilts her head and
looks dreamily at the sky outside She must have read
something romantic

Sue sets a plate of waffles in front of Lucy

LUCY
Thanks Sue Nice haircut

SUE
Thanks

LUCY cuts her waffles into precise shapes but does not eat
them She proceeds like a person with a plan

AT THE DOOR Patty comes back in

SUE (contd)
That was a long break

PATTY
Sorry I got carried away

As Henry watches fascinated Lucy assembles her waffle cut-
outs into -

A TEEPEE complete with ridgepoles smoke hole and a
triangular entrance It’s a perfect little model

LUCY
Sue A cup of coffee please

SUE
You don’t drink coffee

LUCY
I want some today

Sue shrugs and fills her mug Lucy empties her little syrup
cup onto her plate fills it with hot coffee then pushes it
into the teepee’s entrance Steam wafts gently out of the
teepee’s smoke hole

Henry grins captivated by her Lucy doesn’t notice She
grabs her newspaper and eats her teepee while checking out
the crossword puzzle

Henry is so mesmerized that he squirts ketchup onto his home
fries without watching his aim missing his plate

LUCY (contd)
(to the room at large)
What’s a seven letter word for a
Hawaiian musical instrument
HENRY
(to himself)
Oh oh what is it
He grits his teeth concentrating Suddenly the light dawns
HENRY (contd)
(whispers )
Ukulele
He looks up to share his revelation and meet her when -
AN ELDERLY REGULAR across the room shouts out

REGULAR
Ukulele

Henry grimaces cursing his slowness

Lucy flashes the Elderly Regular a huge sweet smile and
goes back to work on her crossword

Henry gazes at her He shuts his eyes then -

- opens them with a look of confidence He lays some money
on the table stands and strides purposefully over to Lucy
She looks up from her crossword and waits to see what he will
say He pauses for a moment thinking

HENRY
Incredibly brilliant pick-up line

She grins

LUCY
Encouraging response

HENRY
Hilarious comeback

Lucy laughs delightedly

HENRY (cont’d)
Perfectly chosen complement

LUCY
Flattered acknowledgement

HENRY
Gracious response

LUCY
Invitation to sit down

HENRY
Casual acceptance

Henry sits across from Lucy Their eyes lock in an intense
vortex of mutual attraction

CUT TO

HENRY back at his table where his eyes open again It was
just a flight of imagination He puts some money on the
table stands and starts to walk timidly over to her without
the confidence of his fantasy He does not realize that -

THE FRONT OF HIS PANTS AND SHIRT are splattered with ketchup
Just as he reaches Lucy’s table he discovers this He
hurries past her and out the door

Lucy lifts her head sniffing the air
INT AQUARIUM BATHROOM - DAY

The next day Henry changes out of his splattered uniform
into a new pair of jeans and a pressed white shirt He rips
the tags off his clothes and examines himself in the mirror

As usual his hair sticks straight up in front He wets his
hands in the sink and plasters it down

As he polishes his shoes with a wet paper towel his hair
rises insistently back up to its former position He pushes
it down It pops up again He jams a baseball cap over it

INT MISS PEARLS - DAY (MORNING)

Henry looking the best weve seen him strides into Miss
Pearls He carries a shoulder bag He looks around and
sees -

LUCY receiving a plate of waffles from Sue She sits at the
same table as before reads the same book and is even
wearing the same tan oak leaf shirt

Henry sits one table away facing her He slides a
dictionary and thesaurus out of his bag

Just as she did before Lucy lets out a huge SIGH closes her
book and looks out the window After a moment she grabs a
newspaper off a nearby table and opens it to the crossword

Henry eagerly fingers his reference books But then Lucy
shrugs and tosses the puzzle aside Henry looks crushed

Lucy looks for the mouse and not seeing it begins cutting
her waffle up into precise little shapes

She quickly assembles a mini log cabin from her waffle
pieces She makes a tiny door for the front and places it in
the rectangular doorway but it falls inward The door frame
is too big for her door

Henry watches

She tries propping the door again and it falls again
Henry seizes a toothpick from the dispenser on his table
walks over to Lucy and shows her with a gesture how the

toothpick can be inserted from the top to make a hinge She
tries it The door works perfectly

She smiles up at Henry delighted

HENRY
Hi Im Henry

He offers his hand and they shake

LUCY
Lucy

When they let go he rubs his fingertips curiously

LUCY (cont’d)
Oh Im sorry Syrup

She sucks her sticky fingers and he sucks his made sticky
by hers Their eyes meet for a looooong moment then they
both blush and look away

LUCY (contd)
Would you like to join me I saw
you sitting by yourself

HENRY
Thanks sure

Henry sits They smile at a loss for what to say Henry
points to the little cabin

HENRY (cont’d)
Who lives there

LUCY
The Waffleonians

HENRY
Do they get along with the Pancake
People

LUCY

No They are bitter enemies You
never see them on the same plate

HENRY
Thats too bad because beneath the
skin theyre made of the same
stuff

They both shake their heads at this tragedy

HENRY (cont’d)
So what do you do

LUCY
I teach art to kids Are youan
architect

HENRY
No I work with dead fish

Henry bites his lip at the stupidity of this comment
Lucy regards him curiously

LUCY
Why do you carry a dictionary and
thesaurus

HENRY
In case I need to get something off
a high shelf

Lucy laughs They are so charmed by each other that neither
notices -

SUE across the restaurant watching them concerned
Someone taps Sues elbow She looks over at -

THE CHESS MAN one of the Regulars He sits alone at a table
which holds his breakfast and a chess board with a half-
finished game

Sue reaches down to take one of his pawns with her queen
then takes a different Customer’s order Multi-tasking

LUCY
That’s a strange way to describe
your job Do you work on a fishing
boat

HENRY
I just wanted to explain why I -
He pauses Theres no other way to say it

HENRY (cont’d)
Smell the way I do

She leans across the table toward him and inhales deeply
through her nose Henry grimaces expecting the worst

Lucy shuts her eyes in bliss and lingers close to him

LUCY
Ahhhhh

Henry stares at her as if shes crazy

LUCY (cont’d)
I love that

HENRY
Dont make fun of me

Her eyes snap open chagrined

LUCY
Oh no I sincerely mean it

HENRY
Why would anyone love the smell of
stinky mackerel

LUCY
My brother Luke died three years
ago

Henry looks totally confused

LUCY (contd)
He worked on the fishing boats in
Alaska Just like my Dad and my
other brother Doug But Luke was
on a crab boat that went down in a
storm in the Bering Sea They
never found his body I guess the
crabs got him

Her voice trembles a bit

LUCY (contd)

I think it killed my mother She
had a heart condition but it got
worse after that She died three
months after Luke I think the

worst part for her was that Doug
and my Dad wouldnt stop fishing
Its what they do They love it

Henry nods listening

LUCY (cont’d)
So now its just me my Dad and my
brother They still go to sea for
months at a time and when they ship
out I always wonder if I will see
them again But they always come
back all tired and dirty with
their pockets full of fishy hundred
dollar bills and I always give them
a huge hug and Im so glad to see
them alive that I hug them for five
minutes each and they smell just
like you

She leans forward for another heavenly whiff

LUCY (contd)
Its my favorite smell in the
world

Henry just stares at her stunned

HENRY
I never suspected that someone like
you might exist

LUCY
So which fleet are you with

HENRY
No I work at the Aquarium

LUCY
Youre kidding That was my dream
as a girl

HENRY
Whats your dream now
LUCY
You first
HENRY

Ive been building a boat To sail
around the world

LUCY
For how long

Henry thinks then grins
HENRY

Until I find someone to name the
boat after Whats your dream

LUCY
To meet a man with the guts to do
something like that

They gaze at each other transfixed

LUCY (contd)
And to have a family of my own
And a Labrador retriever named
Pete

SUE eavesdrops increasingly troubled

LUCY (cont’d)
And to scuba dive the great barrier
reef and to learn how to fix my
Volkswagon engine

Their faces have drifted rather close for strangers who have
just met Lucy snaps out of it and pulls back

LUCY (cont’d)
Okay Henry You seem great so
obviously theres some horrible
thing you havent told me Whats
your dark secret

Henry’s silly grin vanishes

HENRY
Theres this walrus

EXT THE SEATTLE WATERFRONT - DAY

Miss Pearl’s restaurant is like a pink frame around Henry and
Lucy who talk earnestly in their window seat as pedestrians
stream by and the tourist trolley CHUGS past

BIG GRACEFUL FERRIES glide across the placid Sound and -
SEA LIONS play in their wake

MOUNT RAINIER towers majestically over it all

INT MISS PEARL’S - DAY

Henry and Lucy having long since finished their waffles
share a silent contemplative moment

LUCY
You saved the walrus life You
gave him more eight years You can
feel great about that But you
cant live your whole life for him
You can’t sacrifice your own
happiness The world is full of
sick walruses

Henry takes her hands moved Sue bustles over immediately
SUE
I hate to break this up but you
finished eating an hour ago and we
have people waiting
Lucy looks at Sue surprised by her curt tone

LUCY
Sorry Of course

Lucy and Henry stand and prepare to leave
HENRY
Would you like to take a walk Or
should we just go have lunch

Lucy laughs then looks at her watch shocked

LUCY

Oh no Im so late
HENRY

For what
LUCY

Every year my Dad and I drive up to
Snohomish to get a Halloween
pumpkin Its a little ritual
weve had since I was a kid I
cant skip it How about tomorrow

HENRY

Lucy looks distressed again
LUCY

volunteer at the Senior Center
HENRY

LUCY
I would love to

HENRY
Great Its a date What time

LUCY

They grin stupidly at each other

LUCY (contd)
I had the strangest feeling when I
woke up this morning Like today
was not a normal day

EXT OUTSIDE MISS PEARLS - DAY

Henry walks her to her car which is a blue Volkswagon Bug
They linger by it unwilling to part

LUCY
That thing you said about how you
never suspected someone like me
existed

Henry nods

LUCY (cont’d)
Me too

They shake hands and then she impulsively hugs him taking a
long deep sniff of his fish-scented hair SIGHING with
pleasure Then bashful at her own boldness she lets go and
fumbles for her keys

Henry in a daze walks around a big delivery truck to his
own vehicle a rusty pickup

Once hes behind the truck and Lucy cant see him he bursts
into an ecstatic dance jumping up and down and waving his
arms in pure joy screaming noiselessly Finally he has met
The One
Hes so carried away that he does not notice -

THE TRUCK backing out exposing him He looks up to see -

LUCY doing the same silly dance suddenly exposed also She
spots him at the same moment

Embarrassed they dive into their cars and drive off
INT HENRY’S SAILBOAT - NIGHT

Henry lies back on his single bunk SIGHS blissfully and
shuts his eyes

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY (DUSK)
Henry’s lovely white sailboat bobs gently on the waves as it
glides toward an impossibly gorgeous sunset of clouds colored

coral rose apricot and gold

ON THE DECK Henry lies stretched out in a lounge chair
steering his craft with one foot lifted to the wheel

LUCY in a white bikini emerges from the cabin holding a
tropical drink in each hand The drinks are topped with lime
slices and paper umbrellas She hands one to Henry and lies
with him on the lounge chair snuggling close

Henry takes a long sip of his ambrosial beverage and turns to
look his beloved in the eyes

HENRY
We are halfway between Costa Rica
and Hawaii Three thousand miles
from any store Where did you get
the umbrellas

LUCY
Before we left I calculated that
three years at sea equals one
thousand sunsets So I got this

Lucy reaches into a storage locker and pulls out -

A CARDBOARD BOX printed with the logo “1000 COCKTAIL
ACCENTS” She opens it revealing -

1000 PAPER UMBRELLAS in the closed position
Henry smiles

greets him with a frown She seats him at a small table

SUE

COOK (0OS)

As Henry opens his menu he looks up to see -

LUCY entering She wears the same oak leaf shirt as the
previous two days She scans the restaurant looking right
past Henry and seats herself at her usual table She stares
at her left thumb rubbing it curiously

Henry confused walks over to her table He sits and offers

her a huge smile She looks up
HENRY
I had the most incredible dream
about you last night It was so
real
Lucy glares coldly at him
LUCY
Who are you and who asked you to
sit at my table
Henry is taken aback then laughs

HENRY

Lucy backs away frightened

LUCY
Get away from me Creep

Henry is bewildered He can see that she means it

HENRY

LUCY
LEAVE ME ALONE RIGHT NOW

Regular Customers look over alarmed Sue rushes up

SUE

moment

HENRY
No I

SUE

Henry slowly stands his eyes on Lucy who continues to
regard him with alarm and anger Sue grabs Henry’s arm and
hustles him toward the door

LUCY
Thanks Sue Get rid of him

Lucy shakes her head angrily then composes herself and
returns her attention to her left thumb

EXT OUTSIDE MISS PEARL’S - DAY

Sue leads the stunned Henry out to the sidewalk In the
alley Patty sings the heart-rending finale from “Aida”

HENRY
I didn’t do anything wrong

SUE

Henry looks at her uncomprehending

SUE (contd)
I help her family take care of her

Realization slowly dawns on his face

HENRY
Oh my God She’s crazy

SUE
No She’s not crazy

Henry is lost

About a year ago she was in a
terrible car accident She and her
Dad went up to Snohomish to get a

His powerful arms are tattooed with sharks fish and
mermaids As he drives past the fields of rural Snohomish
County Lucy happily cradles -

A PUMPKIN in her lap
Marlin zips around a curve and looks horrified at -

A COW standing smack in the middle of the road He swerves
and veers off the pavement He GASPS at the sight of -

A MASSIVE OAK TREE
The cow at the sound of a HORRIBLE CRASH bolts away
The upper branches of the tree SHAKE raining acorns on -

THE PUMPKIN flung clear of the accident One side is bashed
in oozing orange pulp

BACK TO
EXT OUTSIDE MISS PEARL’S - DAY

SUE
Her Dad broke some ribs But Lucy
suffered a serious head injury
She lost the part of her brain that
handles short term memory

Henry struggles to make sense of this

HENRY
So she can’t remember anything

SUE
Not exactly She has all of her
long term memory That’s a
different part of the brain She
remembers her whole life up to the
night before the accident She
just can’t retain any new
information Her slate gets wiped
clean every night while she sleeps

HENRY
For example

SUE

You You would be new information
She honestly has no memory that she
met you And what happened today
she won’t remember tomorrow

HENRY
But she said she was going to get a
pumpkin Does that mean she wakes
up every morning

SUE
She wakes up every morning thinking
it’s October 12 of last year She
puts on her favorite pumpkin
picking shirt and then she comes
here for breakfast because she
comes every Sunday and October 12
was a Sunday She has no idea it’s
more than a year later

HENRY
But she reads the newspaper

SUE
It’s a special paper we put on her
porch every night It’s from the
day of her accident Her Dad got
hundreds of them printed up

Henry is amazed

HENRY
You don’t tell her what happened to
her

SUE

That doesn’t work Believe me

HENRY
But what if there’s snow on the
ground when she drives over here
What if it’s August and ninety
degrees

SUE
I talk about El Nino or global
warming I reassure her
HENRY
So she didn’t go pumpkin picking
yesterday
SUE
Lucy does the exact same thing
every day

A BIG PUMPKIN Lucy looks disappointed

LUCY
You bought one

MARLIN
The lady at the farmer’s market
gave it to me For free

LUCY
But what about our drive

MARLIN
Seems kinda pointless if we already
have a pumpkin

Lucy looks at him confused
INT MARLIN’S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY

art gallery - very bright

MARLIN
It’s too white Gives me a
headache

LUCY

Yeah you need some color in here
Marlin opens a cardboard box revealing -
DOZENS OF CANS OF PAINT in different colors and brushes

MARLIN
I had a feeling you could help me
with that Remember when you
painted fish all over your high
school classroom and the principal
got mad and we told him to just
relax and frame them

Lucy smiles remembering
LUCY

So were going to spend the day
painting together

MARLIN
Why not

LUCY

truth The truth is a disaster
HENRY
How long will it take for her
memory to come back

SUE
The doctors say she will never
recover

Henry looks back at -

LUCY sitting by a window table eating her waffles and
reading blissfully unaware

SUE (cont’d)
It’s a disability A very sad one
Some people lose arms or legs in
accidents Lucy lost something
invisible

HENRY
So how can I get to know her

SUE
You can’t She can never make a
new friend She knew me before the
accident so I can be a part of her
life You never

Henry looks at Sue stricken

HENRY
But I fell in love with her
yesterday

SUE
You don’t know that You just met
her

HENRY

Sometimes it happens right away
It’s rare but it happens

SUE
How can you be sure you’re in love

HENRY

This morning I sang in the shower
and my neighbor called to request
an encore Babies don’t cry around
me My car runs perfectly I’m
four inches taller The sky is
bigger I have to wear these heavy
boots to keep from floating away

Sue considers this

Lucy considers this shrugs and picks up her book
Henry takes a deep breath and walks over She looks up

INT MISS PEARL’S - DAY

Henry sits watching -

LUCY who closes her book with a huge wistful SIGH Henry
anxiously drums his fingers on his table waiting for the
perfect moment

He notices that she is looking at -

THE PORTRAIT of the scowling Miss Pearl Sue passes by

LUCY
Why is she a Miss She should be a
Mrs

SUE

Are you kidding Just look at her
Who would marry that

LUCY
No I think it’s the other way
around She looks that way because
she’s a Miss

(MORE)

LUCY (contd)
She lives to cook breakfast but she
never found her true love so she
was forced to cook for strangers
all her life

SUE
God I hope that’s not my fate

LUCY
Or mine

Henry decides this is the moment He saunters over

HENRY
Maybe I could help with that

He offers Lucy a big goofy friendly grin She smiles at
him - a little too much She and Sue are not looking at his
eyes but at -

A CHUNK OF HAIR that has broken free of the hard shell of his
‘do and risen up to point straight at the ceiling

LUCY
Thanks but I don’t think so

Henry retreats to his table in defeat
INT AQUARIUM - LOADING DOCK - DAY

THE HEAD OF A FISH - an ugly thick-lipped sculpin - speaks
passionately to a sleek silver salmon

UGLY FISH
I love you You are so beautiful
and funny I can’t stop thinking
about you My friends say there
are other fish in the sea but I
say no

SALMON
(feminine)
Thank you very much I don’t mean
to be rude but aren’t you a bottom
feeder

UGLY FISH
But I can change I swear I can

The Salmon just LAUGHS in his face The Ugly Fish opens his
huge fleshy mouth and CHOMPS down on the salmon All this is
made possible by -

HENRY whose fingers are inside the fish heads making their
mouths move He supplies the voices He stands at the fish
cutting table on the loading dock

He looks up noticing -
OLGA 50 a fat Russian woman who has come in to mop the
floor She shakes her head at his antics

HENRY
Olga You’re a woman

OLGA
Sank you for noticing

HENRY
What if a man came up to you ina
restaurant and said ‘Hi I simply
absolutely must join you for
breakfast’

Olga thinks about it
OLGA

I vould say ‘Get on you hands and

knees crawl under zee table and

earn it’

Henry blushes shocked

OLGA (contd)

No I sink I know vhat you are
asking You must be how you
saysincere A voman can smell
bullshit a mile a way Just tell
zee truth

HENRY
In my case the truth would be
something like ‘Hi I am not fit
to even be in the same room with
you much less sit at your table
but if you would let me bask in
your angelic presence for just a
few minutes you would grant a
miserable wretch of a human being
several years’ worth of happiness’

OLGA
Zat might work

through it Will you join me

Henry sits instantly She laughs charmed by his eagerness
Sue walks up scowling at Henry

HENRY
Waffles please

LUCY

Sue nods and leaves

LUCY (contd)
Normally I get oatmeal but I treat
myself on special occasions You
can’t eat waffles every day

Henry nods trying not to smile He notices Lucy rubbing her
left thumb again

HENRY
Is something wrong with your thumb

LUCY
No That’s what’s bugging me I
cut it yesterday but it healed
overnight The Band-Aid
disappeared too

HENRY
Borrow one of mine

Henry reaches into his pocket and takes out a box of Band-
Aids the colorful child’s kind with cartoon characters

HENRY (contd)
I do a lot of wood work so I need

them

LUCY
I like a man who’s good with his
hands

Henry considers this

his waffles He fits them together with toothpicks forming

prince fell in love with a
beautiful girl from the market
Her name was Arjumand He begged
the emperor to let him marry her

him fourteen children They were
inseparable When she died his
hair went white overnight and he
declared two years of mourning He
began to build a monument to her
memory It took the rest of his
life but his passion inspired him
to create the most beautiful temple
in the world

Henry attaches two pillars to the waffle dome

HENRY (cont’d)
The Taj Mahal

LUCY
I thought it was a Viking helmet

Henry looks crestfallen Then he picks his creation off his
plate and puts it on his head Syrup dribbles down his
forehead

DOUG
We take care of her

HENRY

Doug and Marlin look at each other slightly impressed
Henry notices -

A GARDEN POND in terrible shape The water lilies have been
shredded and strewn about the lawn along with the
unfortunate goldfish

MARLIN
She has a serious medical
condition She is vulnerable and
fragile Anyone who disturbs her
life is gonna wind up like those

goldfish

HENRY
You have a raccoon problem don’t
you

DOUG

You’re gonna have a Whitmore
problem if you keep bothering Lucy
That’s us We’re the Whitmores

HENRY
You don’t let her date

MARLIN
She will never get better She
can’t have a boyfriend because she
won’t remember who he is Any guy
who’s okay with that is not okay
with me
HENRY
Okay so she has a disability The
doctors could be wrong But even
if they’re right does that mean
she’s not allowed to have love in
her life

DOUG
She has a lot of love

MARLIN
All you’re gonna do is break her
routine and cause everyone pain

HENRY
Maybe she needs to have her routine
broken

Marlin and Doug scowl and get in his face

DOUG
Listen pal

HENRY
Henry

DOUG

We consulted a specialist about her
day It’s carefully worked out

MARLIN
It’s more than a disability Even
your dog when you come home from
work sees you and wags its tail
because it knows who you are Lucy
could never do that for you

EXT IN FRONT OF MARLIN’S HOUSE - DAY
Marlin walks Henry out the front door

works

MARLIN
Where could I get some of that

HENRY
Only from me

Henry crosses his arms and waits Marlin studies him

A MERMAID figurehead out of a slab of wood

Otto Priceman comes bustling over with two beers
OTTO

So is she finally finished Ready

to take off and sail the world

HENRY
No I need a wheel

Otto looks up bewildered at -

THE WOODEN WHEEL mounted on the steering post

OTTO
You have a wheel

HENRY
That piece of junk That’s just
cheap white pine I banged together
Wouldn’t last a month I need
antique hardwood I’ve been
looking everywhere

OTTO
Just go buy a wheel

HENRY
No way Otto I made everything on
this boat I have to find the
right wood for the wheel It’s the
heart of the vessel the part you
touch the most It has to be
perfect

Otto offers Henry a beer and studies him

OTTO
But once you get your wheel you’re
really going

HENRY
Yup

OTTO
To South America Hawaii the
Pacific Islands a few weeks in
Fiji

HENRY
You don’t get it It’s not about
sailing from port to port like a
cruise ship This is about
surrendering to forces greater than
myself Storms Lightening
Waves But also moments of beauty
that most people can’t imagine
Discovering tiny islands full of
fruit and flowers Being rocked to
sleep by the ocean under stars like
youve never seen Looking a whale
in the eye The thrill of racing
in a hurricane The peace of
drifting in a breeze The way you
can smell land hours before it
comes over the horizon If I live
to be a hundred I’1l never run out
of stories to tell my
grandchildren

Otto takes a long swig of his beer
OTTO
And yet I notice you’re still
here
EXT MISS PEARL’S - DAY

SIGH He walks over confidently

HENRY
Hi I’m Henry And I’m just
strangely happy today for no
reason

LUCY
Get lost

Henry’s jaw drops He retreats to his table

Sue sits down with him

HENRY
The same exact line worked
yesterday

SUE

Yesterday you said it like you
meant it Today you said it like a
line

HENRY
But I do mean it Why would she
respond one way and then have the
opposite response the next day

SUE
(duh)
She’s a woman

HENRY
I keep blowing it But at least
I’ve figured out the right moment
It’s when she puts down her book
and before she does the crossword
But what do I say

SUE
Look why don’t you just buy that
book of hers memorize it and then
say something smart about it

HENRY
No I thought about that but I
can’t It’s taking advantage of
her disability

(MORE)
HENRY (contd)
She has no defense against an
approach like that It would be
like giving a blind person the
wrong change I have to approach
her honestly with no tricks

Sue looks at Henry with new appreciation
SUE
You smell funny and you have weird

hair but you’re okay

HENRY
Thanks

SUE
So how come you never talked to me
in high school

HENRY
I had a crush on someone

SUE
Betty Zimmerman

Henry looks surprised
SUE (contd)
For four years Duh Everyone

knew The real question is how
come you never talked to her

Henry shrugs sheepish

INT MISS PEARL’S - DAY

The next day Henry watches as Sue serves Lucy

troubled

LUCY
I experienced a strange burglary
last night Someone came into my
place and cleaned out my
refrigerator while I slept

SUE
No

LUCY
And I mean they cleaned it out
It’s completely empty and it’s so
spotless it looks brand new

SUE
Your brother One of his jokes

Lucy nods accepting this

Lucy looks
Sue drifts away to other customers
and approaches Lucy

LUCY
The joke is that my brother
actually cleaned something

HENRY
Hi I’m Henry I’m in love with
you

Lucy smiles amused

LUCY
Really But you don’t know me

HENRY
Sometimes it happens in an instant

LUCY
Do you know anyone that’s ever
actually happened to

HENRY
My grandparents

Lucy is so intrigued she can’t help herself

LUCY
Tell me about it

Henry grins and sits

Lucy nods

HENRY
He was a political prisoner in
Argentina She was a human rights
observer sent to interview him
When it was time for her to leave
he asked if he could look at her
face for a while so that he would
have something beautiful to
remember in the long months ahead
He stared at her for a whole hour

caught up in the story

HENRY (cont’d)
One year later she went back for a
second interview He reached under
his bunk and he showed her a little
chip of wood On this chip he had
laboriously painted my
grandmother’s face using ashes
mixed with water for ink and his
own hair as a paintbrush He did
it from memory but it was a
perfect likeness of her

44

Henry sees his opening
He speaks with utter sincerity

HENRY (contd)
She looked at it and then she
looked at him The moment their
eyes met they fell in love

The Regulars near their table stop eating to listen

HENRY (cont’d)
For the next three years they were
allowed to see each other only once
a year for two hours But they
wrote the most incredible
passionate letters every day and
they really made those two hours
count Thanks to her efforts my
grandfather was finally released
and they moved to the US But
every year to this day they spend
a couple of weeks apart and then
when they miss each other so much
they can’t stand it they meet ina
tiny hotel room for exactly two
hours and re-live the passion of
their youth

Their eyes meet And hold Lucy is captivated

LUCY
Is that true

HENRY
I embellished a little

She looks at him questioningly

HENRY (contd)
They met in a donut shop

Lucy laughs then suddenly frowns

HENRY (contd)
What’s wrong

She is looking at something behind him Henry turns to see -

THE HEADLINE on the newspaper of the man in the next booth
It reads ‘DOW PLUNGES’

Lucy checks her own paper ‘STOCK MARKET SOARS’

She looks from one headline to the other Her brow wrinkles
Henry holds his breath

ACROSS THE RESTAURANT Sue holds her breath
Lucy shrugs laughs and takes Henry’s hands again

celebratory ecstatic

Marlin indicates that Henry should peek in and he sees -

LUCY on a stepladder painting the ceiling of the Sistine
Chapel above Marlin’s work bench Michelangelo did an okay
job but Lucy has made improvements Her work is stunning

She is so caught up in her painting and singing that she does
not notice she’s being spied on

HENRY

(whispers

I knew she was an artist but I
didn’t know she could do this

MARLIN
I didn’t know she could sing

Marlin pulls Henry back and eases the door shut

MARLIN (contd)
This only happens after she has
breakfast with you

Henry smiles

MARLIN (contd)
I have a job My job is to give my
daughter the best possible day I
thought I was doing pretty good
but meeting you makes her day
better You can keep making her
little waffle houses and stuff

Henry looks surprised

MARLIN (contd)
Oh yeah she can’t shut up about
you

HENRY
You know you can’t do this forever

Marlin tenses up Doug scowls

HENRY (cont’d)
Some day she’s going to wake up
look in the mirror and see that she
has aged ten years overnight

MARLIN
For now it’s working
HENRY
Tell her the truth
DOUG
You don’t want to see what that
looks like
HENRY

Describe it

MARLIN
Torture If you had a child and
you had to choose every day between
torturing her or making her laugh
and -
(nods at the garage)
sing which would you pick

HENRY
Let her pick Wake her up one
morning tell her the situation
and let her decide

MARLIN
We’re asking you to be her
breakfast buddy Not to mess with
a routine we have carefully worked
out with the help of her doctors
Don’t make us get feisty on you

HENRY
I’m not going to lie to her If
she asks me a direct question like
what year is it I’m not going to
lie

Marlin thinks about this

MARLIN
Don’t ask don’t tell

Henry offers his hand in agreement They shake
EXT A STREET - DAY

Henry driving his battered truck slams on the brakes when
he notices -

AN OLD COFFEE TABLE poking out of the top of a rubble-filled

oak antique in perfect shape A once-in-a-lifetime find

EXT OLSSON’S BOAT YARD - DAY

Henry lifts the wheel to his steering post and slips it on
It fits perfectly Otto raises his beer

up in Tahiti on a sailboat and you
had no idea how you got there

LUCY

Not interested

She breaks free and heads to her table Clyde follows her
and sits much to her annoyance

LUCY (contd)

Clyde you are a liar a cheater
and a manipulator I told you I
never wanted to talk to you again

CLYDE
No you said you would only talk to
me if I signed up for daily therapy
and anger management classes

LUCY
You are not about to tell me you’re
doing that

Sue hurries over to Henry’s table

LUCY

CLYDE

you make your own perfume from the
bush in front of your house You
like to cook artichokes with
Hollandaise sauce and ginger ice

girl you wanted to work at the
Aquarium You sometimes dream of
moving to Buenos Aires and learning
to tango but you’ve never told
anyone that

Lucy stunned walks slowly over to Henry

Two days I should have waited
longer but my ride came and I
thought it would be possible to
track him down somehow It wasn’t
I tried everything
HENRY
Can’t you just go to every turtle
nesting beach in Central America

SUE
There are three hundred forty-seven
of them We’re talking Costa Rica
Guatemala Belize Nicaragua
Panama El Salvador and Southern
Mexico I spent a whole winter
travelling there and I made it to
almost fifty beaches before my
money ran out I maxed out my all
my credit cards

HENRY
But if you went to every single
turtle beach you would find him

SUE
I simply can’t afford it I would
need to pay for a hundred airplane
tickets and rental cars Patty and
I buy a lotto ticket every day
One time we won two thousand bucks
and we made it to ten more turtle
beaches We didn’t find him

HENRY
If I had any money I’d give it to
you

SUE
Let’s not talk about it It’s
hopeless Let’s think of pick-up
lines for you

Henry sighs

HENRY
I’m up to about a sixty percent
success rate If she smiles and
says ‘really’ I’m in

SUE
I noticed that

HENRY
What I want more than anything in
the world is for her to wag her
tail when she sees me

SUE
Huh

HENRY
I want her to look at me and say
‘Hi Henry’

SUE
You don’t have to do this every
day You have a choice

HENRY
Do I Can you choose to forget
about Juno When did anyone in
this world choose love or choose
against it It’s something that
happens to you

photo Of course she freaks out

MARLIN
It’s the fastest way to convince
her

HENRY

It’s the harshest way

HENRY (cont’d)
There has to be a gentle way to
break it to her A more positive
way Have you tried everything
What have you tried

Marlin’s hands tighten on the wheel but he says nothing

know the truth You’re keeping her
in a fantasy world I know she was
once your little girl but now
she’s 28 She has the right to
make her own decisions

Marlin says nothing

HENRY (cont’d)
You’re not doing what’s best for
her You’re doing what’s easiest
for you

HENRY (cont’d)
If you love her tell her the
truth
Doug makes a move but Marlin restrains him

HENRY
Do you ever wonder about half-n-
half

Lucy looks up

HENRY (cont’d)
Packaged foods have to list
ingredients But half-n-half just
says that it’s half one thing and
half another

It could be half dairy fresh cream
and half nuclear waste and they
wouldn’t be lying

They seem happy They don’t have
memories but they’re happy

She is suddenly struck by a thought that makes her cry out in
anguish and bite her fingers

LUCY (contd)
Oh my God they do They hide nuts
They must have memories if they can
find their nuts

Tears well up in Lucy’s eyes at the thought that she is
something less than a squirrel Henry wraps his arm around
her shoulders

HENRY

could stop time

building cautiously approaching Henry and Sue’s half-open
window from the side She crouches low and sneaks unseen
to a spot close enough to eavesdrop on them

in love

Reward Every day When you walk
into Miss Pearl’s and I stand up to
go talk to you it’s the most
exciting feeling I’ve ever known
Failure is so painful Success is
so sweet Crossing that six feet
of floor space is more dangerous
and thrilling than crossing the
Atlantic in hurricane season

my decision It took me all day
thinking and going over these
notes You deserve to be happy
with someone

LATER Henry and Lucy watch as her printer ejects the final
page of a thick document titled “READ ME”

Lucy grabs it then touches a match to

crumpled paper catch fire The flames illuminate their
exhausted tear-streaked faces They look at each other

LUCY
It’s three in the morning

HENRY
One last kiss

LUCY
Henry We’ve been talking and
working since this morning We
havent kissed yet today So for

They come together in the most bittersweet kiss of all

Lucy crawls into her bed clutching the printout to her
chest

THE PINK DOT on the urban waterfront that is Miss Pearl’s
He steers with one hand so he can watch it with binoculars

Sue comes over to relieve him

SUE
Let me take a turn

She takes the wheel Henry sees -

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS a tiny figure that may or may not be
Lucy sitting by the window at her usual table

Henry is knocked off his feet as -

A GUST OF WIND hits the boat heeling her sharply Sue
expertly points the bow higher then winches in the main sail
and the jib Suddenly they’re racing across the water Sue
makes a few quick adjustments to the trim

amazement Sue grins at him

A bottle of wine a dozen candles in windproof holders a
fleece blanket a portable CD player fresh gardenias in

crystal bowls and a gourmet picnic complete with french

bread oysters on ice cheeses grapes and chocolates

They look at each other

SUE (contd)
It’s a fall-in-love kit

Did she really think this would
work We would open this box and
suddenly get in the mood

fills the air

boat rests at anchor On the stern Henry and Sue sit
together wrapped in the blanket

wheelbarrow of supplies for a long ocean voyage - food wine

details onto his mermaid figurehead She has dark hair and
from a certain angle she might remind you of Lucy

ON DECK Sue walks up to the bow

SUE
Hey

HENRY
Almost done Just gotta do the
face

SUE

I noticed you don’t have any
navigation system like Loran or
GPS Are you going to get one

HENRY
Sure

SUE
Which one

HENRY

Whichever one’s better

Sue studies him He’s engrossed in painting red lips onto
the mermaid He finally notices her concern
HENRY (cont’d)
The truth is I have to learn that
offshore stuff I’m not much of a
sailor

SUE
What are you then

HENRY
Nothing I guess

SUE
Have you ever considered the
possibility that there might be a
chance that maybe you happen to be
something of an artist

Sue stares at him His face shirt and his wild hair are
splattered with various colors of paint as he puts the
finishing touches on his mermaid

Henry gives Sue a long look then grins He dips a round
brush in a jar of black paint and adds -

HENRY
No it’s okay

EXT SEATTLE WATERFRONT - DAY
Lucy wanders along the waterfront aimless looking troubled
She notices that she is next to -

moment wrinkling her brow then continues past it

She stops again She turns and looks back at the Aquarium
She checks her watch She shrugs and walks toward it

INT THE AQUARIUM - DAY

Lucy pays her admission and enters After a few steps she
looks all around as if wondering what she is doing there
Tanks full of colorful fish are everywhere but they do not
seem to interest her

A perky female AQUARIUM EMPLOYEE notices her lost look and
comes over to help

AQUARIUM EMPLOYEE
Have you been here before

LUCY
No

AQUARIUM EMPLOYEE
Is there something in particular

URK
Lucy notices -

A BUCKET OF MACKEREL on her side of the moat inside the
concrete wall out of his reach Could the Walrus be hungry
She looks all around No one is watching

Lucy leans over the wall grabs a fish from the bucket and
tosses it to Wally He happily gobbles it and URKS for more
She feeds him again

ON A WALKWAY fifty feet away the Aquarium Director and a
Biologist look over and see what she is doing They watch as
the Walrus accepts lunch from this unfamiliar woman

AQUARIUM DIRECTOR
Oh my God

They run down the walkway toward her

Okay

MARLIN
But she has never in her life been
just okay

Henry looks increasingly worried

MARLIN (contd)
She has this little address book
The same one she’s had for years

friend and then she would flip
through that book and find some
other people to call Now she just
looks through it For hours

tattered black book page by page She reaches the end

Are you looking for someone in
particular

LUCY
No
Lucy flips slowly through her book again her face a mask of
confusion and distress

MARLIN
I can’t make her stop I can’t
make her smile

HENRY
I can

MARLIN
We agreed to respect her wishes

HENRY
Why did you come here

MARLIN
You know her best I was hoping
you could tell me some things that
cheer her up

Henry looks at Lucy’s big tough - but at this moment
completely vulnerable - father He takes a deep breath

HENRY
She likes to make up imaginary
worlds

MARLIN

For example

HENRY
When she eats waffles she pretends
there are these little people
called the Waffleonians

Henry is surprised when Marlin takes out a notebook and pen
earnestly writing this down

HENRY (cont’d)
Uh and they swim in the syrup and
sleep in little beds made out of
butter
Marlin grimly scribbles nodding

HENRY (cont’d)
Marlin Are you scared

family already

dangle in the water

Wally I’m

His voice catches He’s almost crying

THE OARS FROM HENRY’S BOAT tied together with a thick red

collection of nautical charts

dials

SUE (contd)

Henry Are you there Pick up

(pause)
Call me when you get this You
can’t give me your sailboat It’s
sweet but I can’t just sail off
into the sunset I would need some
crew to help and they would need to
have money because I sure don’t

At the sound of a WOMAN’S LAUGH Sue hangs up and goes
curiously to the hatchway to the cabin She looks down
