Tabitha pulls Tim’s new baby TINA along as they run from
Tim and Tim’s wife Carol LAUGHING--

CAROL
Run for your life

TABITHA
No fair dad you peeked

The scene transitions as the Templetons walk to their car
TIM VO
They call me a stay-at-home dad
which means I hardly get to stay at
home

TABITHA
Let’s go

TIM IS IN A RACE CAR WITH HIS FAMILY
Racing around a track

TIM
Buckle up Templetons Ready

TABITHA

TIM VO

Now some might say I still have an
overactive imagination but being a
dad is the coolest job in the
world A bunch of cool jobs
really

Their car rockets ahead across the finish line

TIM VO (CONTD)
Sometimes I’m a race car driver

They pull ahead and cross the finish line at the grocery
store

CAROL
Woo Daddio Andretti
TABITHA
Yay Templetons

IN THE KITCHEN--

Tim dressed as an OLD WESTERN CARD SHARK dealing cards to
Tabitha and Tina

TIM VO
(Western voice)
Well and then sometimes I’m the
best darn cook in the county and I
deal out every meal

-- which transforms into Tim cooking multiple grilled cheese
sandwiches

TABITHA
Come on pa hit me

Tina BURPS

TABITHA (CONTD)

Tina

TIM
Woo doggy And the house wins
again

MONSTER VERSIONS OF THE TEMPLETONS gather around Tim as he
operates on a covered figure

TIM VO
(Monster voice)
Or a surgeon if need be

TIM
Spork

CAROL
Spork

TIM
Spatula

TABITHA
Spatula

TIM

Give my creature life

The Templetons watch as a GIANT LAMB-LAMB rises from the
operating table
TABITHA
She’s alive

Tim no longer in doctor’s scrubs hands Tabitha the newly
sewn Lamb-Lamb while making her GROWL

Tabitha ACTS AFRAID

TIM VO
We have our ups and our downs

Lamb-Lamb falls apart and Tabitha tears up

TIM
No no look look Lamb Lamb’s ok
See

He pulls one of the loose threads restoring Lamb-Lamb

TABITHA
Yay

TIM VO
But we always stick together This
is my wife Carol--

CAROL
It’s a miracle

AT AN AWARDS SHOW
Carol is dressed in a gown receiving an award

TIM VO
She’s the breadwinner of the
family

Instead of a statue Carol is handed a LARGE BAGUETTE

CAROL
Thank you You know what they say
it’s all about the dough And I
couldn’t have done it without my
husband he really rose to the
occasion

As the audience cheers Tim dressed in a tuxedo T-shirt
yells--

TIM
It’s the yeast I could do

TABITHA
Yeah mama
TIM VO
She brings home the bacon too

IN THE KITCHEN
Tim fries the bacon in a pan

TIM VO(CONT’D) (CONTD)
While I keep an eye on our new baby
Tina

In her high chair Baby Tina spies on Tim with binoculars

TIM VO(CONT’D) (CONTD)
But sometimes It feels like
she’s keeping an eye on me

Tim looks up to see-- Tina quickly going back to being cute
He turns back around and she scribbles notes in a note pad

AT THE DINNER TABLE

Tabitha wears her new school uniform as they celebrate her
good news with cake A banner reads “You’ve Been Accepted”
and then hand-written “-- To Second Grade”

TIM VO (CONTD)
And Tabitha our little second-
grader-- just got accepted into the
best school in town

TABITHA
Thank you

CAROL
Yay Tabitha

TIM VO
We’re so proud

A CAMPAIGN POSTER

We see an adult JIMBO STACI and their baby standing in
front of a “Re-elect Jimbo for Mayor” poster

TIM VO (CONTD)
I still keep in touch with the old
gang too Believe it or not Jimbo
is mayor now

Jimbo and Staci take a selfie in front of his campaign
poster
JIMBO STACT
Cookie Cookie

TIM VO
Of course his wife Staci is the
real brains behind the operation

DRIVER
Yo Jimbo

A car speeds past revealing three familiar TRIPLETS on
motorcycles

TIM VO
Now the triplets

TRIPLET 1
Busted

TRIPLET 2
Busted

TRIPLET 3
Busted

TIM VO

They haven’t changed much
DOUBLE DOORS-- LEAD INTO TED’S OFFICE

TIM VO (CONTD)
And as for my baby brother Ted

Ted is silhouetted against the city skyline Great suit
great view He squeezes Senor Squeaky as he handles multiple
calls

TIM VO (CONTD)
Well he grew up to be the Boss
all right He’s so busy we hardly
see him any more but he always
remembers to send inappropriately
lavish gifts on special occasions

THE TEMPLETON BACKYARD

Tabitha runs over and gives Precious Templeton the pony a big
hug

TABITHA
Oh em gee Uncle Ted is the best

Precious stares daggers at Tim who holds a shovel
CLOSE-UP ON A MUG
It reads “WORLD’S BEST DAD”

TIM VO
Hey all in all my life is pretty
perfect

Pull back and see Tim drinking from the mug lying on a
beach He’s in a TROPICAL PARADISE with Carol and Tina
sitting next to him

TIM VO(CONT’D) (CONTD)
But all that was about to change

Suddenly a VOLCANO ERUPTS IN THE BACKGROUND Lava spews
everywhere

TIM
(to Carol and Tina)
Good heavens I’1ll save you

Tim quickly puts Carol and Tina safely in a tree

CAROL
(still reading her
magazine)
Thanks babe

Tim looks around and spots Tabitha surrounded by books as the
lava approaches

TIM
(calling out)
Stay calm Tabitha

He turns his beach chair into a surfboard and begins surfing
the lava

TIM (CONTD)
I’m coming for you I’m going to
save you from the bubbling lava--

Suddenly the lava parts and Tim’s surfboard grounds to a halt
in front of a very focused no-nonsense seven-year-old
working at a desk

TABITHA
Dad what are you doing

The rest of the scene dissolves leaving Tim in the living
room holding a roll of Mentos and a soda bottle
TABITHA (CONTD)
Ew gross it went everywhere

TIM
Come on this is the candy
volcano of doom You used to
love it

TABITHA
But I’m trying to do my homework
or I’m doomed

She gathers her stack of books and leaves

TIM
Oh

TIM VO
Because if there’s one thing I’ve
learned it’s that you’re only a
kid once Once you grow up you can
never go back

9300 - BEDTIME

INT TABITHA’S ROOM - NIGHT

Tabitha flosses diligently in the reflection of an award She
smiles then looks to the photo of Rosie the Riveter taped to
the wall and imitates her pose before going about her night
time routine

She lays out her uniform making sure to give its acorn
button a shine when she sees a spot

TABITHA
Oh no

She feeds her fish

TABITHA OS
(to fish)
Good night Dr Hawking

With her hand over her heart Tabitha recites the periodic
table with all of the reverence of the Pledge of Allegiance

TABITHA
Carbon boron beryllium lithium
helium hydrogen
(opens her eyes)
Nailed it Boom shakalaka

Tabitha climbs under the covers for some light reading before
bed a book of math jokes

TABITHA (CONTD)
(laughing)
Carry the four Gosh

Tabitha looks up from the math equations to see her entire
family standing over her

TIM
Hey there Tabitha it’s the Good
Night Show live from your bedroom
starring dad and mom--

CAROL
And special guest baby Tina

Tabitha gives Tina a big kiss

TABITHA
Good night little Tina

CAROL
(to Tina)

Tabitha kisses Carol’s cheek

TABITHA
Good night mom

Carol kisses her back

CAROL
Good night sweetheart

Carol exits with Tina as Tim sits down on the edge of the bed
with his GUITAR

CAROL (CONTD)
(to Tina)
Momma’s gonna kiss you momma’s
gonna kiss you

He starts to sing--
TIM
(singing)

GOOD NIGHT SONG WITH YOUR DAD

Tabitha takes out her EARBUDS--
TABITHA

TIM
It’s time for your goodnight song

TABITHA
Oh no thanks
(puts back in earbuds)
I’m listening to white noise Helps
me fall asleep

TIM
Hey what would you say to me

holiday pageant

Tabitha clams up

TIM (CONTD)
Yes Right I can come to school
with you and we can get all of
your friends together and we can
rehearse together go get some ice
cream after my treat

TABITHA
No You can’t do that Um

thing

TIM
Oh right right Right Oh How

TABITHA
(loudly )
Uncle Ted was a magical talking
baby there was a rocket full of
puppies and you saved the world

Tim removes her earbuds

TIM
Shhh it was a good story wasn’t
it

TABITHA

Well it didn’t really make a lot
of sense

TIM
The jokes were good right

Tabitha gives a noncommittal shrug

TIM (CONTD)
Ok uh

TABITHA
(yawning)
Dad my schedule is brutal
tomorrow

TIM
Yeah my schedule’s pretty brutal
too Don’t forget Lamb Lamb

He reaches over to where Lamb Lamb leans against a small
shrine to Uncle Ted

TABITHA
Good night Lamb Lamb

She kisses Lamb Lamb then turns to the photo

TABITHA (CONTD)
Good night Uncle Ted I hope to
grow up and be a success just like
you Maybe we’ll see you soon

TIM
Good night Tabitha

He leans in for a goodnight kiss but--
She sticks out her hand

TABITHA
Don’t you think I’m a little old
for that now

Confused Tim sticks out his hand and she SHAKES IT

TIM
Ok

TABITHA
I think it’s time we both grow up
I look forward to greeting you at
the breakfast table

She puts a sleep mask over her eyes and hugs her book of math
jokes to her chest

TIM
Sweet dreams

Tim clearly hurt turns out the lights and closes the door

0400 - TIM TIME

IN THE ATTIC - LATER

Among the usual attic stuff are the CONTENTS OF TIM’S OLD
ROOM arranged almost like they were when he was a kid He
pulls out a box of Christmas ornaments and several COLORFUL
BEADS fall out

Tim picks one up and flops back on his old bed reminiscing

TIM
Where has the time gone

MUFFLED VOICE OS
How should I know

A one-armed figure wearing a T-Rex head struggles out of a
BOX

MUFFLED VOICE
Wait wait I see light Out of my
way
(inhales deeply)
At long last The sweet breath of
freedom

He removes the T-Rex head to reveal-- it’s WIZZIE

TIM
Wizzie

WIZZIE
You there What century is this

Tim reaches out and grabs Wizzie

WIZZIE (CONTD)
Unhand me vile ogre

TIM
No no no no Wizzie it’s me
It’s Tim

WIZZIE

Wizzie reaches his (only) arm out to Tim

WIZZIE (CONTD)
Come closer Let me see your
face closer closer still

Tim brings Wizzie right up to his face

WIZZIE (CONTD)
Oh Timothy

Wizzie draws his arm back and SLAPS Tim

WIZZIE (CONTD)
It is you

TIM
Hey What was that for

WIZZIE
You cast me into eternal darkness
and wreaked havoc on my Circadian
rhythms

Wizzie shakes his arm angrily and the numbers on his clock
flip erratically

TIM
I’m sorry Wizzie Hey but you
look great though

WIZZIE
Except for the arm you mean

TIM
I didn’t even notice

WIZZIE
You thought it

TIM
I mean I noticed Because you
don’t have an arm--

WIZZIE
You would never treat Lamb Lamb
this way

TIM
Well I I gave her to my

daughter Tabitha

WIZZIE
You have produced an heir Timothy

Wizzie GRUMBLES

TIM (CONTD)
Ok I’m just I’m afraid Tabitha
and I are growing apart Like
Like I did with my brother

WIZZIE
(sighs sympathetically)
Oh

TIM
I thought we had all the time in
the world But you can’t turn
back time can you

Tim’s (rhetorical) question hangs in the air Then--

WIZZIE
How dare you question my power

Wizzie starts windmilling his arm(s) backwards while invoking
the most ancient force in the universe--

WIZZIE (CONTD)
Turn back Turn back oh great
wheel of life

TIM
Oh here we go

Just then Tim HEARS SOMETHING He hits Wizzie’s snooze
button and Wizzie begins to SNORE

TIM (CONTD)
Wait Did you hear that

Wizzie wakes up

WIZZIE
Never abuse the snooze button

TIM
Sh It sounds like it’s coming from
the baby’s room

He presses his ear to the floor

WIZZIE
What is it A creature of the
night Witches Is it the baying of
the hounds of hell

TIM
Wizzie

Tim heads towards the stairs Wizzie calls out after him--
WIZZIE
Don’t go Tim I can turn back
time To the Golden Years when it
was just you and me--

In his excitement he falls off the night stand onto the
bed and to the floor

WIZZIE OS
My good arm
MOMENTS LATER - IN THE HALLWAY
Tim walks quietly toward the nursery filled with deja vu
WIZZIE OS
(faintly)
Don’t open the door remember
last time

From inside he hears a VOICE Curious he--

Baby Tina rips off her PJs in one motion to reveal that she’s
WEARING A SUIT UNDERNEATH

BABY TINA

like F minus see me after class

It hits Tim how far apart he and his brother have grown
TIM
Sad Yeah maybe a little I don’t

while you just stop trying

BABY TINA

TIM

This is clearly very emotional for Tim
Baby Tina nods her head sympathetically then--

BABY TINA

ground You gotta wake up everyday
and you gotta say yes Yes Yes
Surprise me say yes

She HOLDS OUT HIS PHONE

a toy horse

Tina tosses the horse out of the crib
TIM (CONTD)
Oh whoopsie your little horsie

Tabitha

Tina smiles

0700 - FAMILY REUNION

TEMPLETON HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

Tim brushes his teeth when the house begins to shake
Downstairs Tabitha looks up from her homework Baby Tina’s
eyes light up

Tim looks out the window and watches a helicopter touch down
in the street in front of the house

A mysterious bundled up figure exits the helicopter and makes
his way to the front door

DING DONG
CLOSE ON-- a finger presses the DOORBELL once more
Back inside--

TIM
Don’t worry I got it

Tim opens the door to reveal--

Ted holds up his phone and plays the ransom note style
message

TIM’S VOICE

Precious watching this through the window kicks over a
garden gnome in outrage

Everyone turns and looks at Tim for an explanation

TIM
I swear I didn’t leave that
message

Baby Tina smiles and makes an ‘oops’ face Tim realizes she

did it and has to quickly cover--

TIM (CONTD)
On purpose I

CAROL
Butt-dialed

TIM
With my butt While I was talking
in my sleep I do that sometimes

TED
You sleep-butt-dialed me

I knew there must be a perfectly
logical explanation

The brothers stare at each other

CAROL
And there it is All that matters
is that you’re here

TABITHA
Woohoo yay

TED
Absolutely For now

Baby Tina gives Tim a secret ‘thumbs-up’ and reaches for
Uncle Ted

Tim watches off to the side alone as his family surrounds
brother like a returning hero--

TABITHA
Uncle Ted please stay for
Christmas Please

TED
Sorry sweetie I can’t do Christmas
on the twenty-fifth

his

TABITHA
But Uncle Ted I missed you so
much

Then all sound fades and things seems to move in slow motion
as Tim watches Tabitha-- GIVE HER UNCLE A KISS ON THE CHEEK

It’s like Tim is in a dream-- or a nightmare
Finally Tim SNAPS OUT OF IT to focus on his brother--
TIM
Can I talk to you in the kitchen
Alone
IN THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ted and Tim talk in hushed tones as Tina watches from her
high chair Ted looks doubtfully at Tina

TED
The baby Tim

TIM

there

TED

Up stairs

TIM
That’s right BabyCorp

Tim and Baby Tina look up meaningfully Ted looks up too but
keeps one eye on Tim

TED

So you’re saying the voice mail was
some kind of call for help

TIM
Yes
(then)
No She comes from a secret
corporation run by babies

TED
Tim I’m going to give you the name
of a doctor Roy Federman just
tell him I sent you okay

IN THE OTHER ROOM

Tabitha literally has her ear pressed against a cup on the
door

TABITHA
What are they saying

CAROL

TABITHA
Here you go

Tabitha hands Carol a cup of her own and the two continue to
listen

CAROL
Oh thanks

TIM OS
(through the door)
I’m not crazy

BACK IN THE KITCHEN

Baby Tina is getting fed up as Tim and Ted ignore her and
lock eyes with each other--

TIM
You just don’t remember

Tell him Tina

Baby Tina opens her mouth to talk but she’s interrupted--

TED
She can’t talk Tim

She tries to correct him but she’s cut off--

TIM

Baby Tina keeps trying to talk but can’t get a word in Tim
and Ted are too caught up to notice

Ted laughs a DEEP HEARTY LAUGH Then--

THE SITUATION ROOM

It’s like an air traffic control tower overlooking heaven
The middle of the room is dominated by a HUGE GLOBE INSET
INTO THE FLOOR Babies use sticks to push toy models around

different jobs

ARMSTRONG VO
Just imagine-- baby surgeons uh

floaty float

The earth rotates to reveal Dr Armstrong’s face on the other
side of the planet

DR ARMSTRONG
Yes babies are going to run the
world one day

The real Dr Armstrong parts a curtain and steps forward
through the Earth He’s professorial with muttonchops and a
pipe often wearing tweed--

DR ARMSTRONG (CONTD)
And that day is coming sooner than
you think

Armstrong catches himself and dials down the menacing edge

DR ARMSTRONG (CONTD)
Hello my name is Dr Erwin
Armstrong founder of The Acorn
Center for Advanced Childhood

TIM
Wait a minute that’s Tabitha’s
school

Armstrong stands in a classroom between two students NATHAN
and MEGHAN

DR ARMSTRONG
Here at the Center we believe
babies are the ultimate learning
machines Isn’t that right little

Nathan

NATHAN

DR ARMSTRONG

Armstrong materializes in front of a giant clock

DR ARMSTRONG (CONTD)
They should use this precious time
to develop faster push harder
Parents They have the best
intentions of course but they’re
not experts

DR ARMSTRONG (CONTD)
After all the only thing holding
your child back is you

A beat as Armstrong stares out at the viewer

TED
Childhood was the worst three years
of my life

BABY TINA
(sad)
That’s so sad You probably just
didn’t do it right
(brightening)
But luckily you get a do-over A
second chance

She pulls them through the floor and into a stark white
‘clean’ room where baby scientists in white hazmat suits and
welding masks pour GLOWING BABY FORMULA into a crucible

BABY TINA (CONTD)
BabyCorp has developed a new super-
duper baby formula that can turn a
grown-up back into a baby We have
it in cherry grape orange and
lime

TIM
For real

TED
Wait wait wait wait wait You

Tina pulls out the pacies

0900 - DOWNSIZING

TIMS KITCHEN

Baby Tina opens her briefcase and very carefully pulls out a
BOTTLE OF FORMULA

BABY TINA
It’s the perfect disguise And it
only lasts 48 teensy weensy hours

TIM
Oh I am in on the mission

Tina slaps Tim’s hand away from the bottle

BABY TINA
Sorry Pops It’s not your
mission

TED

(reading the bottle)
Warning may cause drooling
babbling emotional outbursts fits
of laughter loss of bowel
control chubby thighs I think

stuff

Ted squirts a drop of the formula onto his finger and his
ENTIRE HAND SHRINKS

TED (CONTD)
Ah My texting hand

BABY TINA
(to Tim)
Even though it is your daughter’s
school Doesn’t seem fair does
it

Jumping at the chance to help his daughter-- and one-up his
brother-- Tim takes the bottle of formula

BABY TINA (CONTD)
(deadpan)
Daddy no please stop

Tim TAKES A SIP He reverts back to a TEENAGER

TIM
Whoa

BABY TINA
What It actually works

TED
It’s mine

Ted sticks his tiny fingers up Tim’s nose and wrestles the
bottle from Tim He TAKES A SIP He also reverts to a
TEENAGER Tina’s reverse psychology is working

TED (CONTD)
I’m better at this kind of thing

TIM
And what kind of thing is that
Flock of Seagulls

They tackle each other and the formula rolls away

TED
Everything

TIM
Gotcha

Tina watches as they CHASE EACH OTHER AROUND THE HOUSE
taking gulps as they grab the bottle back and forth

BABY TINA
You might feel very emotional Have
some mood swings

Tina pulls a toy teapot out of her case and begins to set up
a tea party for her and Story Bear

As the argument escalates they continue to get younger
their now-oversize clothes falling off of them Tim hits the
wall and shrinks again

TIM
Hey

BABY TINA
Ouch There’s the awkward stage
Now the tea’s hot Connie

TIM
(pre-pubescent voice)
You always have to be the hero

TED
What’s that supposed to mean

Ted SPRAYS Tim’s legs with the formula They SHRINK and Tim
keeps running at Ted on tiny legs

TIM
(pre-pubescent voice)
Never see him all of a sudden he
shows up with a pony

TED
You’re just jealous helmet head

TIM
She’s my daughter

Tim stomps on Ted’s coat and Ted falls back into him

TED
She’s my niece

BABY TINA
(to Story Bear)
Do you want cream or sugar

The two stumble backwards onto Tina’s EXERSAUCER and fly down
the hall Tim hits the wall cracking a picture of the
brothers laughing together as children

TED
I was always the successful one

BABY TINA
Mommy says no running in the house

She takes a sip of tea as Tim and Ted continue their chase
into the kitchen

TIM
Hand over the bottle mullet

Tim grabs the bottle as Ted shrinks into his clothes

TIM (CONTD)
You can’t hug money you know

He races off taking another sip when--

WHAM Tim trips as Precious sticks out a leg through the dog
door He falls to the floor now conveniently a SEVEN-YEAR-
OLD

TED
But you can Tim You can

Ted grabs the formula again fist bumping the pony before
running away with Tim slipping out of his too-large
clothing hot in pursuit

BABY TINA
Men am I right

Ted takes one last gulp as Tim body slams him out of his
clothes--

Uncle Ted is now BOSS BABY

Tim charges toward him--

Then start acting like a block

TIM
What does that mean I’m the block
I’ve always been the block

They walk behind some bushes followed by the children
collecting the money There is a brief SCUFFLE

BOSS BABY
Yeah not even close

TIM
It’s all I do is block I wake up
in the morning I block

Boss Baby and Tim now dressed in school uniforms emerge
from the bushes and head toward the entrance

TIM (CONTD)

block
BOSS BABY

TIM

No you’re not Stop it

BOSS BABY

The two children reemerge from the bushes in the sailor
outfits and carrying wads of cash

KID 1
Sweet

KID 2
Suckers

Boss Baby stops Tim as they draw closer to the school and
points to the children gathering at the entrance

PA VOICE
Children only beyond this point No
crying is permitted in the
separation zone

As each student approaches the entrance to the school their
acorn LIGHTS UP yellow blue red or green corresponding
with colored paths that tell them where to go

Tim hands Boss Baby the bug

TIM
Ok looks like we gotta split up

BOSS BABY
Good I could use a break

Tim sees Tabitha and is distracted--

TABITHA
Bye mom

The boys look over to see Tabitha getting out of the car

CAROL
Alright bye honey

TIM
Ah there’s Tabitha

CAROL
Ill see you after school

TABITHA
Ok

Tina fogs up the rear window and writes “TEEMWORK” on the
glass as Carol pulls away

BOSS BABY
Apparently there’s no “A” in
teamwork either

Tim starts to follow Tabitha into school but Boss Baby holds
him back

TIM
Alright let’s boogie

BOSS BABY
Not so fast I’m blue-- you’re
yellow

They look down at their acorns-- indeed Boss Baby’s GLOWS
BLUE like Tabitha’s while Tim’s is YELLOW

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
You’re over there in the choo-
choo

A MINIATURE YELLOW TRAIN loaded with babies approaches

TIM
It’s full of babies

BOSS BABY
Is it I didn’t notice Just
kidding It’s hilarious

Tim casts about desperately for a way to stay with Tabitha--

TIM
Wait Your tie is crooked

Tim kneels down and adjusts Boss Baby’s handkerchief-cravat
BOSS BABY
Ok Tim focus Meet outside
Armstrong’s office at 1115 we’ll
sneak in and we’ll plant the bugs

Tim quickly SWITCHES THEIR ACORNS then steps back to look

Boss Baby notices the switch

TREEHOUSE at the top

Tim follows a blue line as he walks

DR ARMSTRONG VO

Tim dutifully follows the blue line to its end where he sees
a group of students walking through an open door Tabitha is
among them

TIM
Yes

Excited Tim races after them through the door and into--
A CLASSROOM

Tabitha is in the front row reading Tim sees his chance

TIM
Hello
TABITHA
Hello Nice plant
TIM
This is my emotional support

plant Hi I’m new here

NATHAN a pale skinny (intellectual) bully pipes up--

NATHAN
-- Said nihonium to the other
elements in the Periodic Table

He raises his hand and gets a failed high-five from MEGHAN

his lackey

TIM
Okay

Tim tries to find a seat but Nathan blocks him--

NATHAN
Can’t sit here Or here Or there

Tim heads for an empty desk but Meghan appears
underneath it

She throws the chair with a GROWL

NATHAN (CONTD)
Seating position is determined by
class rank We can’t possibly
include your data given that the
rigor of your previous school is an
unknown variable

MEGHAN
Sick burn Nathan

They high five again and MISS

MEGHAN (CONTD)
Ow

TABITHA
Here you can take my seat

from

She offers him her desk Tim can’t help but show his fatherly
feelings about how she handled the bully--

TIM
I’m so proud of you I mean--
thanks

TABITHA
Okay

They both settle into their new desks

A robotic cart with a monitor for a head standing at the
front of the class boots up

DR ARMSTRONG
(addressing the class)
Good morning

Words appear on the giant computer chalkboard at the front of
the class--

GOOD MORNING

CLASS
Good morning Dr Armstrong

The cart turns revealing Dr Armstrong on the monitor

DR ARMSTRONG
Very warm welcome thank you

Tim stares at the monitor What the

“Dr Armstrong” rolls out from behind the desk and approaches
Tim

DR ARMSTRONG (CONTD)
As you can see we have a new
colleague joining us today

TIM
Hello

DR ARMSTRONG
New colleague why don’t you
introduce yourself

TIM

The name on the bottom of Tim’s desk spins until the letters
rearrange themselves into MARCOS LIGHTSPEED

DR ARMSTRONG
Marcos Lightspeed Colorful
characterful and I like it In any
case welcome Marcos to Blue Unit
Our most advanced class

A FLASH from Armstrong’s monitor Tim blinks

On the wall is a LEADERBOARD with each kid’s picture above a
graph line representing their progress Tim’s terrible
picture appears above an empty line between (but well below)
Tabitha and Nathan

DR ARMSTRONG (CONTD)
This is rarified air we’re
breathing Here at The Acorn
Center we believe that all
competition is
He holds up a finger conducting the class

CLASS
Healthy competition

A NAKED BABY RUNNING THROUGH FRAME

It’s CHAOS in the YELLOW ROOM Lord of the Flies with babies
They’re crying singing biting throwing toys wrestling
BOSS BABY

There’s no teacher just a locked door and some playful
googly eyes on the wall that almost seem to be WATCHING

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
I’m having a panic attack There
must be a way out of here

One of the eyes FOCUSES on Boss Baby

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
Something doesn’t smell right

A baby smelling a marker walks by

Lightspeed
Meghan snickers Tim slumps in his desk a little bit

NATHAN (CONTD)

Tabitha NOTICES Nathan picking on Tim doesn’t like it She
gets a determined look on her face ready to take him down a
notch

He distributes cans of play-doh to the Dum-Dums who create
balls of Play-Doh

The babies work on an assembly line of popsicle sticks
blocks etc as Boss Baby inspires them with aphorisms--

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
The difference in “try” and
“triumph” is just a little “umph”

BABIES
UMPH

Bo Peep creates a single tiny ball of Play-Doh
BOSS BABY

shoots her down--

Their nice moment is interrupted by--

He pops the cap off the marker

IN HIS CLASSROOM-- TIM KICKS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR

TIM
BOOYA

The door closes in his face

He kicks it open again and bursts out with a scowl his hair
slicked back his T-shirt sleeves rolled up to reveal marker
tattoos on his arms and-- for some reason-- a terrible
mustache drawn on his lip

All the kids stare as he struts down the aisle to his desk
He faces the virtual Armstrong defiantly--

TIM (CONTD)

The class buzzes-- what a rebel

DR ARMSTRONG
Listen you know I acknowledge
your anger It’s very feisty But

recalibrating Tim draws a mustache on his screen

Boss Baby GLUE on his hands manages to avoid the patroll
hall monitors from his position on the ceiling

Through the window we can see a LITTLE GIRL is being treated
by a ROBOTIC NURSE

ROBOTIC NURSE

Boss Baby still covered in glue from his prison break
creeps along the wall toward Armstrong’s office

The glue loses its adhesion and he beings to slip off the
wall Boss Baby tumbles off the wall end over end with a
SHOUT

He lands face first on the carpet

BOSS BABY
(face full of carpet)
Ptlzzpfth Ugh It’s like they
always say-- if you want something

He squelches to Armstrong’s door and prepares to plant the
bug but he realizes he can’t quite reach the--

BOSS BABY (CONTD)

STUCK TO THE DOOR

by the fact that hes stuck to the door

BOSS BABY

Boss Baby tries to remove himself from the door but in doing
so accidentally closes himself back outside the office

Armstrong pushes a button on his desk and the door opens
revealing Boss Baby Arms crossed Cool as a cucumber

but it smacks him in the face and sticks there

Armstrong spits out his dentures which slide across the
desk then grips the lapel of his tweed jacket and OPENS HIS
CHEST LIKE A DOOR revealing that--

HE IS A BABY

Armstrong steps out of the suit and onto the desk

DR ARMSTRONG (CONTD)

Unfortunately people are not ready
for a baby in a position of power

He peels off his facial hair and places it on a bust

BOSS BABY
Remind me to get the number of your
mutton chop guy

Boss Baby attempts to plant the bug but it sticks to his
hands When he tries to shake it free it flies into
Armstrong’s bowl of candy

DR ARMSTRONG
You know I could use somebody like
you with a superior intelligence
like my own

BOSS BABY

Armstrong reaches into the candy bowl and EATS THE BUG

DR ARMSTRONG
Somebody who can mmmm truly

BACK AT SCHOOL

Boss Baby enters the EMPTY ATRIUM He follows a PURPLE PATH
until he reaches a dead end at the base of the tree

BOSS BABY

(singing)
Strangers in the night exchanging
glances lovers

(reaching tree)
What is this Some kind of prank
Children can be so cruel

(calls out)
Hello--

His acorn changes from YELLOW to PURPLE and then-- A SECRET
DOOR OPENS BELOW HIM

He hurtles down--

A GIANT SLIDE

It’s like a state fair ride with giants dips and corkscrews--

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
Whoooooaaaaaaeeeece

Finally-- PLUNK He’s deposited in-

A BALL PIT IN A SECRET UNDERGROUND FACILITY
A long wide hallway is lined by enormous concrete rooms

BOSS BABY
Whoa This is exactly like Bill
Gates’ rec room but a little
smaller

He peers through one of the massive windows into an
observation chamber below

Babies with clipboards take notes as various mesmerizing
images are flashed-- a spinning wheel a swinging pendulum
etc

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
What is all this Research and

development product testing
Something tells me this isn’t
daycare

(annoyed)

about now

QUICK CUT TO THE TIME OUT CHAMBER Enya continues to play as
the flowercamera relaxes uselessly

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
Anyway

Boss Baby takes out his PHONE
He angles himself to take a picture when a MENACING SHADOW

looms over him He turns to see a BABY NINJA in an exersaucer
at the end of the hallway

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
Awww now aren’t you a cutie in
that little karate outfit

The baby ninja draws his sword and SLICES THE PHONE IN HALF

More baby ninjas materialize and begin to advance on Boss
Baby

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
Is this some kind of a ninja boy
band

One of the ninjas throws a star at Boss Baby He SCREAMS then
turns on his heel and RUNS

The ninjas give chase and Boss Baby narrowly avoids a flurry
of thrown weapons as he rounds a corner

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
Oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh

He skids to a halt in front of a dead end

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
I give up Cobra kai Cobra kai

Before the ninjas can reach him a FUTURISTIC GOLF CART zooms
past and scoops up Boss Baby

He rides away holding onto the back of the tram safe at
last

BOSS BABY (CONTD)
Sayonara baby

Armstrong (without his grown-up suit) turns from the driver’s
seat

DR ARMSTRONG
Hey there you are

BOSS BABY

One of the ninjas claws his way onto the cart and Armstrong

sprays him with a water bottle

DR ARMSTRONG (CONTD)

Behind him Baby Tina holds the handset of a FISHER PRICE

PHONE to her ear as she lays on the toy train circling the
attic

BABY TINA

BOSS BABY
Don’t they understand it’s the fate

BABY TINA
I’ve been on hold forever

From the Fisher Price phone we hear HOLD MUSIC--

RECORDED VOICE
All operators are currently napping
-- hee-hee

BABY TINA
Ive been on hold so long I’ve got
a tooth growing in

BOSS BABY
Back in my day we wrote memos

BABY TINA
That’s cute and old timey

Boss Baby just goes back to his work pretending like he
didn’t hear

BOSS BABY
Hrmph I weep for the future

BABY TINA

Do you want to talk about your
feelings now While I’m on hold I
can give you twenty minutes

BOSS BABY

Tina hops on the toy train circling the attic

BABY TINA
(nudging)
Let’s get to the nut the nugget
What are you afraid of

BOSS BABY
Sharks getting shot in the head
with an arrow and the IRS That’s
it

BABY TINA
There you go Was that so hard
Baby steps Now what about being
lonely

BOSS BABY
I’m not lonely I’m just alone
There’s a difference

BABY TINA
I think it’s time you read your
file

Tina pulls out a folder hands it to Boss Baby

BOSS BABY
Just gimme-- Whoa This is it
It’s so thin

He opens the folder to reveal the single sheet of paper
inside

As Boss Baby reads it we hear YOUNG TIM’S VOICE--

YOUNG TIM’S VO
Dear Boss Baby I promise you this
every morning when you wake up I
will be there Every night at
dinner I will be there Every
birthday party every Christmas
morning-- I will be there Year
after year after year And you and
I will always be brothers
Always

Boss Baby closes the file clearly affected but trying not to
show it

BABY TINA
Makes me want to make a sad face

BOSS BABY
We were just kids We didn’t know
anything about the real world And
eventually you have to grow up

BABY TINA
Just because you grow up it
doesn’t mean you have to grow
apart

BOSS BABY
I don’t know Maybe it’s already
too late

Just then Tim pulls himself in the open window and tumbles
into the attic

TIM
Hey sorry I’m late

BABY TINA
Daddy Daddy daddy

TIM
What’s going on

BABY TINA
Uncle Ted really misses you Isn’t
that nice

Tim approaches and sees Boss Baby working on something

TIM
So whatcha doing
BOSS BABY
Oh I was I don’t know I was

just working on this

Tim sees that Boss Baby has done transplant surgery on
Wizzie grafting HE-MAN’S ARM in place of his missing one

Wizzie winks at Tim Tim is touched by Boss Baby’s gesture

TIM
Look I’m sorry about what I said
at recess

BOSS BABY

What happens on the playground

TIM
I was just worried about Tabitha

She presses a gold star to Tim’s shirt as the train passes
him

He extends his hand to Tim
Tina’s concern builds as she overhears her Dad and Uncle
It’s clear their emotional mission is not over and that they

will slip back into their old ways

She looks at the phone which is still on hold then gets an
idea

BABY TINA

TIM
Yes I have to be there for her

working together

He removes the suit control device and tosses it aside

BOSS BABY

Armstrong rubs the OFF on the power switch away to reveal
TRAP written underneath

DR ARMSTRONG
Well I’d say the bickering the
petty disputes the jealousy-- you

single way Off to the Box they go

He takes the memo then signals and the baby ninjas drag Tim
and Boss Baby away

TIM
What No Not the Box not now

It’s true you can’t stop time But
every once in a while you get a
second chance So even though
you’re only a kid once Well
unless you get to be a kid twice
which is really weird to be
honest But the point is you have
to grow up sometime And you should
always be nice to your brother
