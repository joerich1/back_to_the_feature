FADE IN

EXT MISSISSIPPI RIVER -- NIGHT

An eerie BLACK MIST wafts over the labyrinthine dark river
as it empties into the Gulf of Mexico

Fireworks go off in the blackened sky

The French Quarter of New Orleansnot too far away is lit
brighter than normal if such a thing is even possible

WE drift through the stifling mist and see

»muzzle flashes Sounds of gunfire Different intensities
of both sound and light burst through the black mist at us
EXT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX -- NIGHT

SUPER NEW YEARS -- JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT

We break free of the mist to find a fire as it rages in the
background

»and the remains of a bloody shoot out

A MAN IN A LEATHER COAT AND A DARK GREY ALMOST BLACK HOODIE
JACKET A POLICE SHIELD HANGS FROM HIS NECK

A WOMAN also dead has FBI stenciled on her WINDBREAKER
Automatic handguns aren’t far from anyone’s reach
Blood pools everywhere

Sharp scrapes are heard on the ground Someone is still
alive

He’s CALE BISHOP 30 baby faced but with a steely eyed
intensity tries to get on his feet

A GOLD SHIELD sits on his waist He too wears a DARK HOODIE
JACKET and BLACK LEATHER COAT

He collapses back to the groundit’s too fucking hard In
too much pain Then

Footsteps

The determined cadence marches across the pavement towards
Cale

( )

The BLACK SHOES of the person approaching are polished like
glass

They step in and step out of the pooled blood like it isn’t
there

The BLACK SHOES stop by Cale’s useless body
Cale looks up at the UNSEEN FIGUREplants his head back
down on the cement roadcan’t believe this is the endas

everything around him

CALE
NOOOOOOO00000000

--FADES TO BLACK
SILENCE

THEN A RACING HEARTBEAT

EXT NEW ORLEANS CEMETERY -- DAY

A JAZZ FUNERAL PROCESSION leaves a handful of mourners to
grieve over a casket

The rain falls Not heavy enough for umbrellas but enough to
be an annoying presence

Cale in CEREMONIAL POLICE UNIFORM stands with his hands
clasped firmly in front of him

SUPER CHRISTMAS EVE

There’s a LARGE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE DECEASED NEXT TO THE
CASKET IT’S VICTOR BISHOPIN THE PHOTO HE WEARS A POLICE
OFFICER’S HAT

Mourners shake Cale’s hand for one last time and depart

Cale watches FOUR CRYPT KEEPERS as they position the coffin
inside of a large CONCRETE TOMB

Before Cale leaves he gives each Crypt Keeper a crisp new
HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL They nod their gratitude

Cale turns abruptly Not ten yards away stands OLIVIA
BEAUCHAMP 30 a looker from the womb to the tomb She
drinks him in with those Bette Davis eyes

A gun sits on her hip along with a FEDERAL GOLD SHIELD

Cale stops upon seeing her
INT COFFEE SHOP -- DAY
Cale and Olivia break bread in a tiny corner of the room

OLIVIA
I didn’t know they still buried
people on Christmas Eve

CALE
They do if you pay them enough

OLIVIA
I’m sorry I missed it

CALE
He wasn’t your father Besides my
loser half-brother wasn’t there
either so you more than get a pass

OLIVIA
How’s Claude doing

CALE
Claude is Claude Still as crazy as
ever

OLIVIA

Kinda hard to judge him for myself
since I’ve never even met the man

CALE
Trust me he’s not the meeting

type

Cale stirs his coffee He watches her pour her milk into her
coffee She looks up at him He looks away but not fast
enough

OLIVIA
They say that since Katrina cops
around here have the second highest
rate of suicide

CALE
Really Who’s number one

OLIVIA
Former cops

CALE
Makes sense

( )

OLIVIA
Nothing much does especially
around here

CALE
On that point you’re right My
father Louisiana’s meanest most
selfish son of a bitch died about
fifty years too late My erratic
brother’s a drug addicted criminal
and I’m still stuck in my luxury
accommodations compliments of FEMA
The whole goddamned world is one
giant clusterfuck

OLIVIA
You wanna talk about it

He gives her an ‘Are you kidding me’ look
CALE
Nothing to talk about I’m tired of
thinking of other people Time to
love me some me

OLIVIA
They’1l always be your family--

Pours sugar into his coffee

CALE
So how’s life at the Bureau

Takes the hint

BEAT
OLIVIA
A pain in the ass Like you
CALE
C’mon You know that’s part of my
charm
OLIVIA

Now imagine if you’d just kept your
so called charm from between other
women’s legs we’d still be
married

Her phone rings

She speaks in rapid Creole to the person on the other end

Then hangs up

( )

CALE
How’s the old woman She still does
those Voodoo parties

OLIVIA
The tourists wanna see Voodoo Nana
gives ‘em Voodoo

CALE
Bunch a bullshit that’s what it is

OLIVIA
You still think that everything you
don’t understand isn’t worth
anyone’s time

CALE
Well I never quite got a handle on
you

OLIVIA

Reallywell does that mean I fall
into the same category as not being
worthwhile

Cale lifts his coffee mug to his face and stares at her
above the rim as he sips

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Darkbut a little moonlight slips a note through the
window

Cale lies with his hands behind his head Fully awake
Pensive

Olivia is asleep next to him Her ample breasts shake as
shifts position

Cale lights a cigarette Inhales generously Exhales
Observes the smoke drifting away

His cell phone goes off sharply Snatches it up

CALE
(into phone)
Jesus ChristIt’s Christmas Eve
(beat)
Okay I’1l be there in fifteen

Snaps it shut Lays there Listens to the silence Looks
around Heads over to a desk lifts up

CLOSE ON A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH OF A MAN IN POLICE CEREMONIAL
UNIFORMHIS FATHER

CAPTION READS VICTOR BISHOP - WE WILL NEVER FORGET
He puts it back on the desk

Puts his clothes on and grabs his coat on his way out

EXT NEW ORLEANS STREET -- NIGHT

Cale crosses the streetwalks up to a PANEL VAN Opens the
door

INT PANEL VAN -- NIGHT

---Slides in

There’s a ton of artillery and ammo amongst KEVLAR VESTS
RADIO AND VIDEO EQUIPMENT are scattered on the floor

His Commanding Officer GRIFFIN WALSH 40 with salt and
pepper hair and well toned tosses a vest to Cale

The scars on his body suggest a cop that everyone fears
firsts and respects second An urban warrior

GRIFFIN
About goddamned time

MATT BURNETT 32 with dark bronzed skin and TOMMY KEANE 30
a tall Irish-American watch Cale with an indifference
bordering on aversion

FRANK MARIS 34 short and pudgy picks his nose violently

They carry the rough disheveled look of plain clothes
street disciples too burdened by their jobs to shave

Cale nods at them They nod back

CALE
Won’t happen again boss

Griffin points a BLACK HANDLE SERRATED KNIFE AT HIM
GRIFFIN

Better not Or I’1l bust you back
down to patrol

( )

CALE
Yeahyeah I got it

TOMMY
(to Griffin)
What the fuck is the choir boy
doing here anyway I thought he
didn’t like getting his hands
dirty

GRIFFIN
It’s time he got his call for the
majors Anyone got a problem with
that

They shake their heads

MATT
So what’s the score man

GRIFFIN
We got The Dauphin Finally tracked
his ass to that house behind us

TOMMY
Bullshit How’d you find him

GRIFFIN
I got my sources

Frank Tommy Matt shift in their seats nervouslyCale
stays motionless exchanges a look with Griffin

FRANK

Jesus Christ on a cross
TOMMY

You’re fucking kidding me
MATT

Really is Christmas
CALE

Now what
GRIFFIN

(nods )
The same thing we all agreed we’d
do when it was time to answer
history’s call I have it on good
authority that the son of a bitch
is sitting on a cool fifteen
million dollars My math is a bit

(MORE)
( )
8

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
rusty but when we include the
Captain and Mike those’re a little
over two million reasons we each
need to take him out

All except Cale nod They smell blood

MATT
He alone

GRIFFIN
Nahhe’s only got his bitch up
there They’re counting it out as

we speak
FRANK
We can take them
TOMMY
Hell yeah
MATT
Kinda strange don’t you think
GRIFFIN
How so
MATT

Prison life has made him paranoid
bordering in the neighborhood of
psychotic He’s never without hired
help How is it possible that the
five of us can take him and
whatever armed sons of bitches he’s
got up there

CALE

Word on the street is that he don’t
use bodyguards anymore Last year
he met a sweet little thing named
Cloretta and has since knocked her
up This here Cloretta just happens
to be a so called Voodoo priestess
She’s his good luck charm

MATT
You serious

GRIFFIN
As ‘Dubya’ was when he said
‘Brownie you’re doing a heck of a
job’

( )
9

They laughexcept Cale

Griffin focuses his attention on Matt Frank and Tommywho
nod approvingly Then he looks at Cale again

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
Your old man was a player So now’s
your chance You get to decide
history right here right now

They all glare at himwatching for any sign of weakness
Cale stares back at them Ready Willing Able

He nods firmly Wants to show them that he has the balls to
pull this off

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
We go in under the hoods for this
one

Griffin tosses them SMOKE COLORED pieces of clothing

Cale watches as they put on the DARK GREY HOODIES with the
zips on the HOOD

One by one they zip the Hoodies from the back of their neck
right over their heads and down to their mouths with two
almond shaped eye slits that give them sight

They then put on LONG BLACK LEATHER COATS

They glare at Cale under their masks Almost as though
daring him not to follow through But he does

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
We do this hard and stiff Don’t
dick around and you won’t get
fucked around

They exit the vehicle fully armed like ghosts going into
goddamned Fallujah

INT HOUSE -- NIGHT

Inside is like a Dirty Disneyland Impish statues and
figurines hug the wall Trinkets hang from every available
hook Skulls are nailed to the wall with their standard shit

eating grins plastered on

Oils Powders Dried herbseverywhere

( )
10

The flames of two candles dance in the cool breeze that
passes through the window Incense burns and stifles the
air

A pink CD player hauntingly drawls out an instrumental jazz
piece

CLORETTA 24 is murky and hot like a cup of fresh brewed
Juan Valdez and gorgeously pregnant to boot

She places a stack of Benjamins in a money counter machine
Next to her is THE DAUPHIN late 30s southern good ol’ boy
with reddish crazy eyes He stops counting to snort a line

of cocaine on the coffee table

It hits him in the back of the throat He curses in Creole
French and giggles in ecstasy

On a nearby table rests bales of cash and new handguns
Dauphin goes back counting

It’s precise and methodical herealmost robotic

EXT HOUSE -- NIGHT

Tommy Matt Frank Cale and Griffin climb the chain link
fence that guards the property

A dog howls in the distance at the full moon

Griffin dishes out his orders via hand signals Cale
hesitates Griffin stares him down Cale goes off as told
INT HOUSE -- NIGHT

The Dauphin and Cloretta pack bales of cash into the backs
of TVs The ones with the huge backs that no one seems to
have anymore

EXT WESTERN SIDE OF HOUSE -- NIGHT

Frank sprints to a side door of the house Cale follows with
a hint of anxiety

His hand extracts his weaponflicks off the safetygrips
the handle tightly

( )
11

FRANK
Ready
INT HOUSE -- NIGHT
Cloretta finishes the count on the last stack of cash
A shuffle outside the door interrupts the operation

The Dauphin pushes his head through the beaded curtain from
the kitchen with an anxious look on his face

CLORETTA
What time is it

DAUPHIN
Time no one should be up

The Dauphin scurries to grab a gun from the table Cloretta
grabs a KALASHNIKOV RIFLE from under the sofa’s cushions

The Dauphin secures the doorknobgazes through the
peephole

--A SIZE FIFTEEN HEAVY DUTY MOTHERFUCKER OF A BLACK BOOT
kicks the goddamn door in

The Dauphin is knocked to the floor as
--Griffin Tommy and Matt storm their way in

Cloretta shrieks like a banshee Frank and Cale appear from
the side of the house Frank knocks her to the floor

The Dauphin leaps onto Tommy Tommy spins around helplessly
The others try to get off a shot but can’t do so without
hitting Tommy

The Dauphin rips away the part of Tommy’s Hoodie Mask that
covers the side of his head Gnaws hungrily on Tommy’s ear

TOMMY

Get him off me Goddammit Get him

off Fucking get him off
Frank and Matt go after The Dauphin Griffin keeps his
REVOLVER aimed on them Frank and Matt try to pry him off of
Tommy but he’s as strong as a fucking Ox
Cale stands motionless Just watches Transfixed
Cloretta gets to her feet Rams herself into Griffin They

crumble to the floor

( )
12

The Dauphin kicks Frank in the face Slams Matt’s skull into
the wall Cale rushes forward to help The Dauphin leaps at
him as well Snatches his weapon

BLAM

A shot goes offbut not from the gun in The Dauphin’s
hand

It’s from Griffin’s weapon

Cloretta kneels over him A knife in her hand She wavers
like a tree blowing in the wind Her stomach is coated in
blood Shot by Griffin

Griffin lays there motionless Watches her

She falls to the ground Holds her stomach Not a sound
comes from her In total shock She just looks down at her
body in horror

The Dauphin mumbles underneath his breath His eyes burn

The Dauphin charges Griffin Griffin offloads a shot into
The Dauphin

He won’t go downcontinues his defiant charge

Griffin pumps him full of lead three more times Finally
The Dauphin goes down

Silence

The haunting jazz track is the only thing that breaks the
hushed room until

CALE
Jesus Christ

GRIFFIN
That’s why Christmas was named
after him

FRANK
What do we do

MATT
Yeah man What the fuck do we do

TOMMY
You see this shit

Tommy rips away the remainder of his Hoodie Mask left by The
Dauphin and now soaked in blood

( )
13
GRIFFIN
Calm the fuck down

Tommy tears off a piece of his shirt to apply pressure on
the wounded ear

As their curiosity compels them to examine him

CALE
Hey where’s the woman

The others turn and realize that she’s fucking disappeared
GRIFFIN
You gotta be kidding me Where’d

she go

They kick away loose cushions and boxes Until they hear
her

CLORETTA (0S)
I shall raise up the dead and they
shall eat the living I shall make
the dead outnumber the living
Her voice carries like a megaphone in a concrete room

MATT
Where the fuck is she

GRIFFIN
Find her

Suddenly the entire house is encased in darkness
GRIFFIN (cont’d)
Goddammitsomeone please find

that bitch

Thena struggle in the rich blackness The cops haven’t
quite got their bearings

BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM

Shots are fired Chaos ensues They all panic and fire
back wildly

CALE
She’s got a fucking gun

GRIFFIN
Get some light in here

As Matt and Frank turn on their flashlights

( )
14

Cloretta stands in the middle of their strategic circle

With them all backing each other they don’t see her or know
she’s there until

CLORETTA
I SHALL MAKE THE DEAD OUTNUMBER THE
LIVING

She launches towards the closest targetCale Blows a
powdery dust at him

She rams his ass into the wall fiercelyhe goes for his
gun

Matt’s and Frank’s flashlights glare on Cale and her
Cale’s head is slammed against the wall

--a gunshot goes off Cloretta drops to the ground Fresh
blood gushes from her stomach

Cloretta laughs for a few seconds then it stops

Cale’s weapon smokes

He’s on the floorknocked out from the blow to the head

The flashlights shine on their two bodies on the ground
DISSOLVE TO

MINUTES LATER

CALE’S POV

A DARK MIST drifts slowly apart as Cale opens his eyes and
rejoins the conscious world

The power is back on The house is now lit like it was
Tommy Matt and Griffin hover above him
END POV
Cale’s on the floor A cushion under his head
Griffin helps him up
GRIFFIN
You did good kid Real fucking
good

Cale takes off the Hoodie Mask

( )
15

CALE
What happened

GRIFFIN
You did what you were supposed to
do Survive And with a pretty big
bump on your head for good measure
too
Cale feels the welt at the back of his head Winces in pain
Griffin looks at the others
GRIFFIN (cont’d)
Bag the money and let’s get the
fuck outta here
Cale looks over at Cloretta’s body Her eyes are open long
after her shell has been emptied of its soul It lays on top
of The Dauphin’s body

Cale stares back at her empty eyes Doesn’t even bat an
eyelid

FLASH TO WHITE

DREAM SEQUENCE--

INT BATHROOM -- DAY

As distorted as it is with the hot steam rising from the
tube we see Cale as he walks towards a bathtub

A HAND IS DRAPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE BATHTUB

Reddish water overflows from it It crashes to the ground
and corrupts the integrity of WHITE FLOOR TILES

It flows freely to his feet
He just stands there as we hear the water hitting the floor

He slowly walks forward He reaches for the shower curtain
that partially hides his father’s face

He yanks it open
HIS FATHER BLEEDS FROM A GUN SHOT WOUND TO THE HEAD

END DREAM SEQUENCE

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

SUPER NEW YEARS EVE MORNING

Cale awakens from the dream in shock Screams

Sweats like a whore in church Breathes like a racehorse
after a strong gallop

A CD PLAYERS alarm goes ape-shit with a noisy rock track
HE KNOCKS OVER A GLASS OF WATER AS HE REACHES FOR IT

He slumps back down into his sweat laced bed Springs back
up and runs to

INT TRAILER BATHROOM -- DAY

the bathroom On his knees as he pukes into the toilet
He officially looks like the word SHIT in the dictionary

Gets to his feet

Stares at himself in the mirror Turns the tap on Splashes
the water over his face generously It’s soothes him

He looks up at his face in the mirror again Towels off his
face gently Examines his teeth

SuddenlyA SHADOW IN THE FORM OF A MAN FLASHES BEHIND
HIM

FLASH TO QUICK IMAGES IN BLACK AND WHITE--

NB (THE QUICK IMAGES THAT CALE SEES ARE ALL FRAGMENTED AND
JARRING )

a FIGURE covered in a BLACK HOODIE holds a gun to Cale’s
head

-e-in an open lot with rusty old sailing ships

Cale Griffin and TWO MEN wearing NOPD Jackets all
draw their weapons on A MAN IN A FBI WINDBREAKER

---it’s a showdown Everyone breaks offsteps away
BACK TO SCENE

Cale holds onto his head as though he’s getting a migraine
Grimaces in anguish at the images he’s seen

turns around

( )
17

Nothing but empty space There’s no one there Or was there

On Cale’s face

--he breathes heavily Slumps his head against the mirror
Splashes it with more water Blinks furiously

INT TRAILERLIVING AREA -- DAY

Cale occupies himself with a bowl of Captain Crunch and the
newspaper

The TV watches him Looks up at itsearches for the
remote

Turns up the volume

TV REPORTER
--City Hall and the New Orleans
Police Union still haven’t come to
an agreement on a system of
implementing increased wages
Sources within the NOPD have
informed me that a large number of
officers across the city have not
reported for duty on today of all
days New Year’s Eve--

Cale turns the TV off

Goes back to his cereal and newspaper
WHAM

A noise echoes from the bedroom

Cale’s spoon stops halfway to his mouth Ceases crunching
Sits there Listens Nothing but silence

Goes back to his cereal
WHAM
From his bedroom again Cale knocks the cereal away Grabs

his gun from his hip holster and bolts towards the
bedroom

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

--he enters cautiously Sees no one Hears nothing else
The only thing disturbed is the photograph of his father

It’s now on the floor

He goes to the groundpicks it up Senses someone is
behind him and turns--

Just his shadow He turns away Starts to laugh
CALE
I must be going outta my fucking

mind

He puts the Photo Frame back on the table Leaves the
room

-EVEN AS HIS SHADOW REMAINS IN PLACE

EXT NEW ORLEANS STREET -- DAY

A HEAVY DUTY SUV pulls up alongside the New Orleans City
Hall Building

INT SUV -- DAY

TED JARVIS 42 FBI VETERAN AGENT places a hand on Olivia’s
shoulder

JARVIS
Heyyou okay

OLIVIA
Yeahwhy

JARVIS
You’ve been distant all morning

OLIVIA
(beat)
I’m fine Just been feeling a
bit--nevermind It’s silly

JARVIS
If you’re not up to this--

OLIVIA
I said I’m fine

He studies her

( )
19

JARVIS
Okay it’s simple enough The
story’s been planted that an
accomplice of The Dauphin wants to
turn state’s evidence and declare
who The Dauphin’s killers are All
you gotta do is get Cale back to
our offices in Baton Rouge as soon
as possible

OLIVIA
You’re gonna be there when it goes
down

JARVIS
Yeahjust in case It’1ll also

help sell it

OLIVIA
What about the other guys in Cale’s
unit They’re not stupid

JARVIS
We don’t need them to be stupid
just distracted If we do this
right they won’t even know what
hit ‘em Come Monday we’1ll stuff
their assholes with federal
indictments

OLIVIA
For the record I don’t like it

JARVIS
You do your best work when you
don’t like the task Look you’1ll
be in and out in an hour tops

Jarvis hands her the FBI FOLDER She opens it up and sees a
PHOTOGRAPH OF CALE Rifles through some more papers

OLIVIA
I can’t believe he’d be involved
His file shows some red flags but
nothing to hint he’s corrupt

JARVIS
Would you say that if he wasn’t
your ex-husband

OLIVIA

(beat)
Maybe

( )

JARVIS
The DEA and some boys in Justice
back in DC were planning on
moving on The Dauphin in a matter
of days Now he’s dead And they
want someone to prosecute but more
importantly they want the marked
fifteen million dollars he had
which would go a long way to
securing extradition warrants on
some major bad ass talent in
Mexico

OLIVIA
But we’re not sure--

JARVIS
Whispers around town are that
Griffin’s strike unit was involved
and given his penchant for being an
asshole I’m inclined to believe it
Christ the only reason that
sadistic fucker is still a cop is
because they needed the manpower
after Katrina I’m sorry but we
need Cale to think he could go down
for this in order to flip him on
Griffin and recover the cash

OLIVIA
This is bullshit

BEAT
JARVIS
You still have feelings for him

Don’t you

As she returns the file he grabs her hand For just
second too long She yanks hers away

OLIVIA
I told you it’s over between me and
you

She exits the SUV

EXT TRAILER PARK ROAD -- DAY

It’s mid morning but it looks more like late afternoon The
entire sky is a putrid and sickly gray

Cale walks by THREE KIDS playing with marbles in the dirt
He smiles at them They run away

CALE
(shakes his head)
Everyone’s a goddamned critic these
days

Heads off towards a local street

EXT STREET ALLEY -- DAY

From nowhere he’s pushed onto a wall by a BLACK HOODED
FIGURE

There’s also a REVOLVER now attached to Cale’s head

BLACK HOOD
Give me somethin’ asshole

CALE
(empties out his wallet)
Take it easy man Take it easy

BLACK HOOD
Twenty bucks That all I should
blow a hole in your fuckin’ skull
right now for wastin’ my time

CALE
Don’t be stupid You won’t get away
with it

BLACK HOOD

Fuck you Half of the city’s cops
are out getting drunk Who the fuck
is gonna work the overtime to solve
your murder

Cale looks up to the heavens He can’t find an answer

Black Hood turns him around and uncoversand turns out to
be none other than GRIFFIN

( )
22

CALE
Goddammit

GRIFFIN
(laughs wildly)
You shoulda seen your face when you
saw it was me

CALE
Asshole

GRIFFIN
Hey at least you didn’t say you
were a cop If I’d been a real
crack head piece of shit you’d be
well fucked for sharin’ that juicy
tidbit

BLACK AND WHITE QUICK FLASH

A FIGURE covered in a BLACK HOODIE holds a gun to Cale’s
head

BACK TO SCENE

Cale looks around with concern Something doesn’t feel
right

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
What’s up with you

CALE
You knowI could’ve sworn you
pulled this stunt on me before

GRIFFIN

(shakes his head)
I think you hit your head harder
than I thought C’mon last day of
the year let’s go claim it
Cale looks up at the dark city sky anxiously

CALE
Miserable day to claim

INT GRIFFIN’S BLACK TAHOE -- DAY
Griffin negotiates the road and sips on coffee

Cale’s attention is focused on the outside

( )
23

GRIFFIN
You look like a man who’s got a lot
on his mind

CALE
Ever get the feeling you were being
watched

GRIFFIN
What do you mean Like
surveillance

CALE
Not exactly

Griffin looks over at Cale Curiosity all over his face

GRIFFIN
What the hell are you talking
about

CALE
Forget it It was stupid Just
forget it

GRIFFIN

How long you been a cop now

CALE
Eight years

GRIFFIN
And in those eight years you ever
took the law into your own hands

CALE
What do you mean

Griffin gives him a deadpan look

CALE (contd)
Beat up on a few suspects Couple
of child molesters and such That’s
about it

Griffin cackles loudly

CALE (contd)
What

GRIFFIN
You feel guilty about killing The
Dauphin’s Voodoo bitch and taking

(MORE)
( )
24

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
the money that’s your goddamn
problem

Cale looks away ashamedlyGriffin starts up his laugh
again

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
I knew it I fucking knew it

CALE
It’s not what you think

GRIFFIN
Let me give you a piece of advice
Take as much as you can and get
out A New Orleans cop is nothin’
more than a target for thugs and
civilian lawsuits these days And
you’re gonna deserve something for
the bullshit you’re gonna endure
wearin’ that fuckin’ shield

CALE
Like I haven’t heard that before

GRIFFIN
You have because it’s true You
don’t wanna go out crazy and
tormented like your old man did do
you

CALE
What--

GRIFFIN
Your old man was a hell of a cop
but even he couldn’t keep the
demons at bay could he

Cale bows his head

CALE
We all have our demons

GRIFFIN
True But you more than anyone
would know what I’m talking about

Cale nods Watches the city’s worker bees passing by them as
they head off to their mundane jobs

( )
25

CALE
Hey pull over I gotta take a piss
EXT NEW ORLEANS CITY STREETALLEY -- DAY

Cale strolls into the deserted alley His shadow walks
alongside him on the building’s wall

He heads over to a large dumpster Looks around Whips it
out and pisses all over the wall Relief at last

A bottle breaks a few feet away from him over by a couple of
trash cans He zips up and pulls his gun to investigate

He creeps forward slowly Slowlyslowly Aims his gun

-then a fucking STRAY CAT leaps from behind the trash
cans Looks at him and hisses in anger Takes off

He re-holsters his gun

Behind himhis shadow plastered against the wall flutters
erratically

IT FORMS A HAND THAT REACHES BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THE WALL
AND MOVES TOWARDS HIM

GRIFFIN (0S)
You done playing with yourself

Griffin looks at him from the top of the alley

Cale nods Turns and looks at the wall There’s no shadow
there on the wall anymore He hurries off

INT BLACK TAHOE -- DAY

Cale jumps inside He’s uneasy as hell Shakes his thighs
rapidly

Griffin negotiates the traffic streets with an accomplished
ease Like nothing is actually there

GRIFFIN
Just got a call from the Captain
Says that some prick claims to know
who killed The Dauphin and his
woman

Cale looks at him in shock Returns to gazing outside
Ignores Griffin

( )
26

Griffin looks at him slightly bewildered

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
Did you hear me

CALE
Yeah I heard

GRIFFIN
Okay you been acting weird since I
picked you up You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on

CALE
It’s nothing

GRIFFIN
Bullshit

Cale runs a nervous hand through his hair Might as well
tell him

CALE
That night when we killed them The
woman did something to me with that
shit she blew into my face

GRIFFIN
What the hell are you talking--

CALE
Ever since that night I’ve been
getting this feeling as though I
was being watched

GRIFFIN
(beat)
Watched by whom

Cale can’t answer

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
Well who is it

CALE
(beat)
I don’t know It’s likelike a
presence of some kind

GRIFFIN

(beat)
A presence

( )

CALE
I know it sounds crazy--

Griffin mashes on the brakes

Cale nods

Cale nods

GRIFFIN
Now listen to me good I don’t know
what kind of shit you’re trying to
pull but I’m not in the mood Now
we got ourselves a real life crisis
that could cause me my badge and my
pension if we don’t get our shit
together You may not care about
that but I certainly do because two
million and change doesn’t go as
far as it used to Nod if you feel
me

steadily

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
Good Now in order for all of us to
get through with this situation our
heads have gotta be on straight

steadily once more

GRIFFIN (cont’d)

Good
Griffin gives him a lasting harsh look Drives his SUV
forward
EXT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXCOURTYARD -- DAY

Within a sprawling ship graveyard where former commercial
watercraft were once stripped of their metal

There’s still tons of ship skeletons and bastard machine
equipment still scattered around They compliment the
derelict brick and metal buildings that have long been

abandoned

Cale and Griffin push forward together Griffin is beside

him

BLACK AND WHITE QUICK FLASH

An open lot full of old ships

BACK TO SCENE

Griffin looks into Cale’s faceit shows confusion and
doubt
GRIFFIN
What
CALE
I think I’ve seen this place
before
GRIFFIN
So
CALE
(beat)

II don’t know
Griffins grows frustrated

GRIFFIN
Is this gonna be a problem

Cale shakes his head Griffin places a reassuring hand on
his shoulder

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
Lookif I was in your shoes Id
probably be struggling with what
went done It couldn’t have been
easy for you but now’s not the
time for this Simply putthey
died because of what they did Shit
happens every day and this city is
a living breathing example of
that

Cale looks around Still unsettled

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
Well finish this later

Griffin charges forward
They approach the group
There’s a MAN WITH AN FBI JACKET ON it’s Jarvis

Cale stops in mid walk Looks at them fervently His brow
creases in anxiety

BLACK AND WHITE QUICK FLASH

The NOPD COPS and The FBI AGENT are in the midst of a
standoff

( )
29

BACK TO SCENE
Both the NOPD cops and Jarvis watch their approach

Cale flushed with anxiety wets his lips in anticipation His
hand goes to his holster

Griffin and Cale approach CAPT MERRILL KENTISH 55 with
the body of a defensive end and OFFICER MIKE BREWER 31 the
Captain’s right hand

WHO WERE THE TWO PREVIOUSLY SEEN NOPD COPS IN CALE’S
VISION

JARVIS
don’t give a shit Kentish
We’re going in with or without you

GRIFFIN
What the hell is goin’ on here

JARVIS
If it isn’t the the heart and soul
of the unnatural hybrid of SWAT and
detective

GRIFFIN
The Feds have no jurisdiction here

JARVIS
You couldn’t be more wrong Walsh

Griffin eyeballs him furiously

JARVIS (cont’d)
Oh don’t look so surprised Being
the bag man of this ill conceived
unit do you really think the
federal government wouldn’t be
keeping tabs on you

GRIFFIN
‘Novus Ordo Seclorum’ huh

JARVIS
Your tax dollars at work

KENTISH
Griffin Walsh meet FBI Special
Agent Ted Jarvis attached to the
Baton Rouge Field Office

( )
30

GRIFFIN
I don’t care who he is I just
wanna know why he’s at my bust

JARVIS
We heard a rumor that an accomplice
of The Dauphin wanted to provide
evidence on who his killers were

Griffin looks at Kentish who can only offer a shrug

GRIFFIN
You don’t have the authority

JARVIS
I see your shitty police badge and
raise you one federal gold shield

GRIFFIN
Bullshit

JARVIS
The Dauphin had been transporting
drugs and cash across the border to
here via Texas which makes it a
federal matter all the way

GRIFFIN
You’re stretchin’ it to get what
you want If this guy whoever he
is can help us find the killers we
deserve first crack at him

JARVIS
And have some unfortunate incident
occur Not a chance

GRIFFIN
Son of a bitch

Griffin pulls his gun

Jarvis does the same which in turn sends Cale Kentish and
Mike into the same downward spiral

»just like in Cale’s vision
-euntil they all point a gun at Jarvis

Then from out of nowhere Olivia steps into the middle of it
all

Cale can’t believe his eyes What the fuck is she doing
here

( )

She tries not to look at him but it’s just too hard Finally
turns her attention to the testosterone fueled men

OLIVIA
You can’t have a pissing contest
and measure your dicks at the same
time boys It’s either one or the
other

A few chuckles are heard

Jarvis looks right at her She ignores him Cale still has
his eyes on her

Everyone slowly holsters their weapons Jarvis walks off in

disgust

GRIFFIN
Well well well The prodigal
daughter has returned You decided
to come on back to the force

OLIVIA
I’m quite happy with the Bureau
but thanks for asking

She nods to Cale

CALE
(beat)
Olivia

Griffin chuckles

OLIVIA
Just like old times

GRIFFIN
So what’s this really all about

KENTISH
Like Jarvis said we got a tip that
one of The Dauphin’s crew wants to
turn himself in here today

GRIFFIN
(to Olivia)
What exactly is the FBI doing here

OLIVIA
All I can say is that we have a
special interest in anyone that can
help us solve The Dauphin’s murder
and recover his cash

( )
32

Kentish looks at Griffin Griffin remains stone faced
Olivia runs her hand over Cale’s unshaven face

OLIVIA (cont’d)
(smiles deviously)
Caleyou wouldn’t happen to know
where all that money is would you

Griffin pulls Cale a few steps back by his shoulder

GRIFFIN
Why would he

Cale looks away from Olivia

OLIVIA
Why indeed

She walks away to rejoin Jarvis

CALE
I don’t like this They know
something

KENTISH
They’re fishing As long as we keep
calm and find this guy first
whoever he is we can take care of
it

GRIFFIN
Sounds good to me

CALE
Now what

GRIFFIN
(beat)
The Feds ain’t gonna leave so we
gotta control them as best we can
The best way to do that is to keep
them with us Propose a truce and
invite them to join forces with us
They may actually come in useful

Matt and Tommy arrive in a blue pickup truck Kentish
Griffin and Mike hurry over to meet them

Cale is left alone He walks over to Kentish’s SUV Leans
against it Watches everyone

The CAR STEREO in the SUV suddenly turns on First
staticthen musicthen more static

( )
33

Cale looks around Reaches inside the car and turns off the
stereo

The stereo turns on again This time louder than before
With all static No music

CALE
What the hell

Cale reaches inside through the window again and turns it
off

Cale looks towards the others All are accounted for
He draws his gun Walks behind the SUV cautiously
Nothing there

Cale stands motionless perplexed A SHADOWY FIGURE FLASHES
BEHIND HIM

FLASH TO QUICK IMAGES IN BLACK AND WHITE--

--Olivia tries to compress Mike’s bloody wound
--Cale runs from a barrage of bullets

-someone in a Hoodie Mask searches for Cale and Olivia in
a dark storage room

-Jarvis gets shot in the head on a building rooftop
BACK TO SCENE

Cale sweats profusely Throws up on the ground Leans on the
the SUV for balance

Griffin walks up to him

GRIFFIN
You lost your balls all of a
sudden
Looks up at him
CALE
Fuck you
GRIFFIN

High hopes Unless you think you’re
God or something Hey we can’t
afford to have this guy get to the
Feds So you better be ready

( )
34

CALE
I don’t need you to tell me how to
do my job

GRIFFIN

Good Because we wouldn’t want any
harm to befall Olivia would we

Cale glares at Griffin He can’t believe what he’s
hearing

CALE
What did you say

GRIFFIN
The day of your old man’s funeral
I coulda sworn she spent the night
over in your shithole trailer
Seems you two are back together
Tell me something are her tits as
good as they look

Cale’s eyes burn with rage at Griffin

GRIFFIN (cont’d)
If you think I’m scared of you
you’re gonna be in for a
disappointment

CALE
Stay the hell away from me

GRIFFIN
I can’t now You and me are joined
at the hip and I hate to say it but
you’ve got me thinking that I can’t
trust you anymore Who knows what
youll say if you’re motivated
enough I’m not going down because
of you or anyone else

KENTISH (0S)
Everyone gather ‘round

Griffin walks towards Kentish Leaves Cale by himself

CALE
Shit

Cale spits to the ground and walks off
Cale’s shadow follows his every step like a normal obedient

shadow would except this one carries eye slits where no
shadow should have

( )
35

The entire compliment of NOPD cops and Jarvis and Olivia
hover around Jarvis’ SUV

JARVIS
Okay this is how it’s goin’ down
NOPD will assume tactical
command and we will oversee but
this still remains a federal
investigation

KENTISH
Since our man power is limited
well spread out and cover as much
ground as we can If this guy’s in
here we’ve got to find him No one
tries to apprehend singlehandedly
Call for back up Set your radios
to channel 3

Kentish and Griffin exchange looks
KENTISH (cont’d)
So what the hell are we waiting
for

Everyone breaks off in NINE separate directions

Griffin pauses and takes a look over his shoulder at Cale as
he disappears inside a building

He turns to find Olivia watching him He blows a kiss at
her Walks off into a section of another building

INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXSOUTHWEST END -- DAY

Olivia walks stealthily along a wall She hears a SHARP

SCRAPING SOUND coming from the room on the other side of

her

She approaches cautiously Gun out Finger on the trigger
Turns the corner

finds Cale over Mike who’s convulsing
She rushes towards them

OLIVIA
What the hell happened

Cale moves out of the way Stands above her

( )

CALE
Came around the corner Heard
sounds like someone was in a fight
Found him like this Jesus is he
gonna live

Olivia compresses his wound with her FBI jacket Cale looks

on

BLACK AND WHITE QUICK FLASH

Olivia compresses Mike’s wounds

BACK TO SCENE

Cale runs his hand through his hair

OLIVIA
We gotta call for help

CALE
I already tried My cell’s dead
So’s my radio

OLIVIA
What

She tries hers instead Looks on her cell phone’s

screenNO SERVICE

OLIVIA (cont’d)
Shit

Mike gets worse with each passing second
CALE

Jesus we gotta do something for
him

Olivia is out of her league here and knows it

slips away

CALE (contd)

FUCK

OLIVIA
Did you see who it was Anything at
all

CALE

I told you that when I got here he
was already like this

Mike quickly

( )
37

OLIVIA
I didn’t hear any gunshots You

CALE
They must’ve used a silencer

OLIVIA
Who could’ve done this

CALE
I’m guessing the guy we’re in here
to find right Makes sense Lure us
in here and then kill us all

OLIVIA
That’s not possible

CALE
Why the hell not

OLIVIA
Because we made it up

CALE
What do you mean you made it up

Olivia runs her hand through her hair This shit is now
getting out of hand

OLIVIA
The FBI suspected Griffin’s unit
was responsible for killing the
Dauphin and his girlfriend and
stealing his cash

This news shakes Cale to the very core

OLIVIA (contd)
The DOJ and DEA were putting
together a case to move on him The
fifteen million dollars were all
marked and could’ve tied him to a
Mexican cartel our government wants
out of business We find the cash
we give the government their case
The only way we could get to any of
you was to flip one of you

CALE

And your ex-husband was the logical
way in

( )
38

OLIVIA
Naturally I was to take you back
to Baton Rouge to be interrogated
By the time Griffin and the others
found out it was all a ruse We
would’ve had what we wanted

CALE
Jesus

OLIVIA
That’s not what I expected to hear

Cale can’t look her in the eye

OLIVIA (contd)
Please tell me what I told Jarvis
Tell me that you didn’t have
anything to do with killing The
Dauphin that night

Cale walks to the wall Bangs his head softly into it

OLIVIA (contd)
Cale Please

CALE
It wasn’t supposed to happen We
were just gonna rob them and leave
Things got outta hand

OLIVIA
How could you be so stupid

CALE
They were animals It was self
defense I swear

OLIVIA
It wouldn’t have to be if you
weren’t there in the first place
What the hell happened to you

CALE
I was tired of living in squalor
Tired of living in this fucking
city I want out
Olivia draws her gun on him

OLIVIA
Turn around

( )
39

CALE
What are you doing

OLIVIA
I said turn around Now

Cale obliges her

CALE
Olivia have you even considered
that Griffin knows this is a ruse
and that he’s the one who killed
Mike

OLIVIA
Why would he do that Mike’s part
of your team isn’t he Mike was in
on it too

CALE
Isn’t it obvious He’s cleaning
house He’d want to get rid of all
of us

She looks him in the face Knows he’s got a point But even
still she tosses him the handcuffs

Cale puts them on Has a sour look on his face

CALE
You’re making a mistake Liv

OLIVIA

I’m taking you to Baton Rouge as I

was ordered We get back on

schedule and get you out of here

Let’s move
Cale turns reluctantly and walks off in handcuffs Olivia
follows closely
EXT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXCOURTYARD -- DAY
Cale and Olivia approach the rally point

They get into her car

INT OLIVIA’S CAR -- DAY

She tries to start it Nothing happens She tries again
Nothing

OLIVIA

You gotta be kidding me
CALE

What
OLIVIA

This car just had a tune up and now
it isn’t starting that’s what

He looks at her
OLIVIA (cont’d)
Don’t say it Don’t you fucking say
it

They exit her vehicle

INT SUV -- DAY
They get into Jarvis’ FBI SUV

Olivia grabs the spare key from the sun visor Tries to
start it

Nothing

OLIVIA
SONOFABITCH

Slams the steering wheel in pure frustration Looks over at
Cale

OLIVIA (cont’d)
Get out
EXT SUV -- DAY
Olivia lifts the hood up

OLIVIA
Well

CALE
Well what

( )
41

OLIVIA
Why won’t it start

Cale shakes his head Looks around inside the car

CALE
Looks like your fuel pump hose is
gone

OLIVIA

Well can you fix it

CALE
This car ain’t going anywhere

OLIVIA
Who would--

CALE
Who do you think

Olivia ushers Cale into the SUV and locks it

CALE (contd)
What the hell are you up to now

OLIVIA
What do you think I’m gonna try to
hotwire one of these bad boys and
drive us outta here

She tries every other vehicle thereeven Griffins
Kentish’s and Tommy’s trucks All to no avail

She pulls her hair back and ties it in one as if that will
help her think of her next move Her fingers tremble
slightly

She puts on a brave face and lets Cale out

Jarvis approaches in a trot There’s a SHOTGUN strapped
across his back His cell phone to his ear

Olivia draws her weaponuntil she sees it’s him

JARVIS
What the fuck is going on

OLIVIA

That’s what I’m trying to figure
out

( )
42

JARVIS
I can’t get a damn signal on this
phone

Looks around at the vehicles then Olivia and Cale
JARVIS (contd)
What the hell are you still doing
here You should be halfway to my
office by now

OLIVIA
They won’t start

JARVIS
What’re you talking about

OLIVIA
None of the vehicles can start

Jarvis looks over to them

JARVIS
What happened
CALE
Griffin messed with them
JARVIS
What did he say
OLIVIA
They’ve been sabotaged
JARVIS
All of them
CALE
Don’t you understand English
asshole
JARVIS

Hey Cale why don’t you suck the
butter from my ass If it wasn’t
for you and your friends we
wouldn’t be in this mess in the
first place

CALE
So now it’s my fault

( )
43

JARVIS
It seems I’m not the only asshole
that doesn’t understand English
either

OLIVIA
Goddammit Jarvis Now’s not the
time We found one of the cops from
Cale’s squad killed

Jarvis can’t believe what he’s hearing The strain and worry
of the last few minutes takes over Olivia’s face

JARVIS
Show me

OLIVIA
Are you serious

JARVIS
Show me Show me now It’s not like
we can go anywhere

INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXSOUTHWEST END -- DAY

Olivia and Jarvis enter the room where they found Mike Cale
is still handcuffed

--but the room is now empty
Cale and Olivia question each other with glances

JARVIS
So where’s this body

CALE
It was right here We left Mike
right fuckin’ here

JARVIS
Maybe you got the wrong room

CALE
This is the spot

They look around fervently

JARVIS
(taps his chest under his
coat)
Maybe he was wearing a vest and
wasn’t that badly hurt

( )
44

OLIVIA
He was shot to pieces

JARVIS
Even if that’s true where’s the
body Or the blood for that matter
A guy the size of Mike would have
bled a shit load of blood

CALE
(beat)
I don’t know Something’s wrong
here

Jarvis glances at Olivia

OLIVIA
II don’t understand either This
is the room

CALE
We know what we saw

Jarvis walks around the room Looks at every spec of dust he
can find and there’s plenty Sees nothing Hears nothing

JARVIS
Well whatever happened here will
have to be dealt with after you
leave You’re still on the clock

CALE
(beat)
This is Griffin’s handiwork
Earlier he made a threat to me He
threatened Olivia too

JARVIS
What did you say

CALE
(beat)
He said I should keep my mouth shut
about what happened with The
Dauphin or he’d hurt Olivia

OLIVIA
You son of a bitch And you’re just
telling me this now

CALE
I’m sorry okay I’m a screw up I
get it I screwed up our marriage
(MORE )

( )
45

CALE (contd)
I screwed up my career But you
don’t wanna fuck with Griffin
Trust me

Olivia turns him around and takes off his handcuffs

JARVIS
What the hell are you doing
OLIVIA
(to Cale)
Try anything stupid and I’1l kill
you
JARVIS

Agent Beauchamp

OLIVIA
If Griffin was good enough to take
down Mike he’s good enough to take
down any of us We’re better off
not having to watch Cale and our
backs at the same time Let’s go

Cale hurries off Jarvis yanks Olivia by the arm

JARVIS
You working for Amnesty
International now What the fuck
was that

She looks away

JARVIS (contd)
(beat)
Jesus You’re still in love with
him aren’t you

OLIVIA
We got a job to do

JARVIS
Then here’s a piece of
advicestart acting like it

Olivia shakes him off and runs off Jarvis gives the room a
final look around and follows

EXT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXCOURTYARD -- DAY

Olivia waits helplessly in the middle of the yard On her
knees

Jarvis runs up to her Slows to a walk Then stops He sees
what Olivia sees Which is nothing

ALL THE VEHICLES ARE GONE

They look around in stunned silence First at each other
then at the empty yard

JARVIS
What the hell is going on around
here

OLIVIA

I don’t like this

JARVIS
And where the hell is Cale

Cale runs up to them Jarvis draws his gun and aims at him

JARVIS (contd)
Where were you

CALE
I got lost This place is like a
maze What the hell happened

JARVIS
Look around Tell me what you see

Cale walks around the courtyard until it hits him that the
vehicles are all gone

CALE
Where’d they go

JARVIS
That’s what we’d like to know

Jarvis punches him to the floor Lunges on Cale like a
fucking madman

JARVIS (cont’d)
You son of a bitch

Jarvis keeps pounding away on Cale Olivia tires to pry him
away Jarvis shoves her aside

( )
47

JARVIS (contd)
I’m gonna ask you one last time
What the hell is going on

CALE
I don’t know I swear

JARVIS
Fucking liar

Jarvis atop Cale rams the gun against Cale’s templeuntil
Olivia fires her gun inches from Jarvis’s ear

Jarvis rolls off of Cale He’s in agony Dazed and confused
Cale struggles to get to his feet Olivia checks on him

JARVIS
You bitch

OLIVIA
You knew that about me from the
beginning

Cale wipes away the blood from his head

OLIVIA (cont’d)
Listen to me Both of you

They stop and look at her

OLIVIA (cont’d)
Cops and Feds aren’t exactly the
best of friends but if we’re gonna
get through this we’ve got to learn
to work together We gotta pool our
resources and figure out what the
hell is going on

Cale nods Jarvis breathes heavilyhis chest a volcano
ready to explode

CALE
Those cars couldn’t move a few
minutes ago and now they’re all
gone

JARVIS
Are we sure this is the right spot

OLIVIA
Of course it is

( )
48

CALE
Maybe the others took off to get
help

OLIVIA

Even if the vehicles could move
there’s no help to get Half of the
NOPD is out sick over the wage
issue every other law enforcement
official is in the French Quarter
right now making sure it doesn’t
implode on itself It’s New Year’s
Eve remember

Cale digests what she says

CALE
This has gotta be Griffin Only he
could pull this off

OLIVIA
I don’t wanna hear anymore about
Griffin

CALE
Ignoring the problem won’t make it
go away

JARVIS
Okay asshole say it’s him other
than killing us what’s his real
objective

CALE
To keep from having to divide up
that fifteen million

He looks around hopelessly

OLIVIA
So what do we do

JARVIS
We walk There’s a gas station a
couple of miles outside this dump
If I push the panic button I could
get Washington to send a hundred
Feds to cover every square inch of
this place

CALE
Are you crazy Jarvis How far you
think you’re gonna get This
(MORE )

( )
49

CALE (contd)
complex is over five square miles
of steel and concrete on either
side of the only dirt road in here
Whoever helped Griffin moved those
vehicles is still around and
they’1ll be waiting for us to try
and walk out so they can pick us
off like they did Mike

JARVIS
Shit who the hell put you in
charge anyway

CALE
Look I don’t care about all that
JARVIS
I’m not puttin’ my life in your
hands kid
CALE

Then fine Walk outtta here Go on
I doubt you make it half a mile

OLIVIA
Jarvis he’s right It could be a
trap This complex is one way in
and one way out We’d be sittin’
ducks and it’d spare them the task
of hunting us

Jarvis looks around at the decaying brick and metal
structures that inhabit the area They look like old ghosts
staying long after their time

The overhead sky gets darker and darker as time passes on
Jarvis throws his hands into the air in frustration Returns
to his cell phone Tries desperately to make a call All to
no avail

OLIVIA
Now what

CALE
Tally what we have

JARVIS
What the hell for

( )
50

CALE
To know what we’re working with

The dirt ground cushions the fall of Cale’s service issued
SIG SAUER MOSQUITO PISTOL

Olivia drops A BERETTA PX4 9 pistol and two clips She shows
them a RIGHT ANKLE HOLSTER WITH A SMALL GUN

Jarvis lowers his REMINGTON 870 SPECIAL PISTOL GRIP SHOTGUN
AND A BOX OF SHELLS

Cale further extracts a Smith and Wesson pistol from his
ankle

and three sets of cuffs twist ties his cell phone a
small flashlight and an expandable baton

JARVIS
Are you always this prepared

CALE
Never know when you’re gonna have
to kill the guy you work with

A rustling sound low on the ground disrupts them Something
moves in the shadows

Jarvis Cale and Olivia draw their weapons

JARVIS
Come out of there

OLIVIA
Now

The shadow takes a three dimensional form and crawls
forward It’s not a shadow but actually Matt He’s covered
in blood

A BLACK SERRATED KNIFE IS STUCK IN BETWEEN HIS SHOULDER
BLADES

The others rush to himCale’s eyes are wide open in shock

CALE
Is he gonna make it

Jarvis tries his best to pressurize the wound Matt makes it
all the more difficult as he constantly thrashes about

( )
51

JARVIS
Hold him down for fuck’s sake

Matt fights to stay alive but loses his grip on life and
expires looking up at Cale

Cale looks down on Matt Then looks away Screams in
anguish

The feeling of helplessness returns to suck the adrenaline
out of them

CALE
That’s the type of knife Griffin
uses

JARVIS

(nods )
I’ve seen him with it

Olivia heads off towards where Matt came from

JARVIS (contd)
Where are you off to

OLIVIA
To find out what the hell is going
on You coming

She draws her gun Slinks away into the darkness

Cale nods his head in gusto Draws his piece and follows
her

JARVIS
Shit

Draws his shotgun and follows reluctantly

INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BUILDINGHALLWAY -- DAY

The group maintains a defensive stance with their weapons
They follow the trail of blood that came from Matt

INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BUILDINGWEST ROOM -- DAY

Jarvis as point man enters the room quickly Cale follows
him Takes up a position on the left flank Olivia then

tails him Takes up a spot on the right flank

They spot a BODY on the floor Exactly where the blood ends

( )
52

They move forward cautiously Keeping eyes on their backs
flanks and above them as well

They make their way over to the bodyturn him over
IT’S TOMMY

CALE
Awww fuck

Jarvis examines the bullet holes in Tommy’s chest Point
blank kill shots

Cale walks towards a segment of the wall Part of the
wallpaper has been stripped away

Cale looks back at Olivia and Jarvisthey’re still
engrossed by Tommy’s corpse

OLIVIA
Matt’s blood trail ends here which
means this is where it starts
Maybe he and Tommy got in a fight
and they went at it

Cale walks towards the wall Cautious but purposeful

JARVIS
Tommy was killed professionally
Clean No fuss There’s no way Matt
could’ve done this in the condition
he was in if Tommy drew first
blood

OLIVIA
Griffin

JARVIS
(nods )
Who else
Jarvis tries his cell phone again Nothing
OLIVIA
We got no choice now We have to

make a run for it

CALE (0S)
Guys

Olivia and Jarvis hurry over

Cale points to the stripped wallpaper

( )
53

The letters D’ ‘E’ ‘A’ and D’ peak from behind the
wallpaper They don’t know what to make of it

Cale goes to tug the hanging piece of wallpaper

OLIVIA
Dont

CALE
It could be a message from one of
the others

JARVIS
Strip it

Cale yanks at the wallpaper It peels away stubbornly
Jarvis helps him There’s a lit fire under their asses to
uncover what’s underneath it all

Cale and Jarvis step back in line with Olivia They look
worried

We see the letters are actually words which is actually a
message

YOURE DEADEVERY LAST ONE OF YOU
JARVIS
That son of a bitch thinks he can
scare me
Jarvis turns and looks up to the rafters
JARVIS
I’M RIGHT HERE GRIFFINCOME GET
ME COME GET ME
Silence
Cale walks towards a window Stares out into the distance
He spots a moving shadow The shadow goes towards a wall and
seems to blend with it The shadow turns and looks at
Cale

It has the face of his father

Cale slams his eyes shutand re-opens them slowly His
father is gone

Only blackness resides on the wall All shadows and dust

( )
54

OLIVIA
Hey You okay

No answer

OLIVIA (contd)
CALE

Cale takes off

Olivia scampers after him Jarvis follows

EXT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX -- DAY

Cale runs to the spot where he thought he saw his father
There’s nothing

He reaches out to the wall to touch it Half expecting the
shadow to move away It never does He shakes his head in
anger for even considering such a stupid thing
Olivia and Jarvis finally catch up to him
OLIVIA

Calewhat the hell is wrong with

you You just can’t run off like

that We gotta stick together

Cale nods

--until a slew of bullets rain down on them furiously
Jarvis dives behind an OLD PIECE OF MACHINERY

Olivia drops to the groundreturns fire

Cale dives to the concrete Fires round after round into the
direction of the muzzle flashes

Jarvis takes out his cell phone Hoists it in the air
looking for a signal Gets nothing Curses in frustration

Olivia and Cale crawl to join Jarvis behind the decrepit
machine

Jarvis takes a swing at Cale Cale swings back Jarvis
blocks it Tries to force Cale beyond the protection of the
machine heap

Olivia fires a shot into the air

55

OLIVIA (cont’d)
I should kill both of you now and
save my own ass

JARVIS
Kill him Olivia If Griffin wants
his squad mates dead he can have
them all I’ve had it up to here
with the NOPD Why should we die
for him

OLIVIA
Shut up

CALE
From the time you showed up with
your stupid ruse to get me out of
here Griffin probably figured it
out and was gonna kill you and put
the blame on me or whoever they
were gonna frame for my death

JARVIS
Shut your cake hole Shoot him
Olivia

OLIVIA

No one’s getting shot

JARVIS
Then I’11 do it

The barrage of bullets ceases

FRANK (0S)
I AINT GOING WITHOUT A FIGHT

CALE
That’s not Griffin It’s Frank

OLIVIA
What the hell is he doing

JARVIS
FRANK IT’S FBI AGENT TED JARVIS
I’M HERE WITH AGENT BEAUCHAMP AND
CALE BISHOP

FRANK (0S)
STAY AWAY FROM ME

Jarvis and Olivia are confused

OLIVIA
What’s his deal

CALE
(beat)
I don’t know

JARVIS
Something spooked him

Cale gets to his feet

CALE
FRANK

Cale falls to the ground just as another half a dozen slugs
race to end his existence

FRANK (0S)
I’M NOT GONNA GO OUT LIKE THE
OTHERS I EARNED MY SHARE

BEAT
JARVIS
Poor bastard saw the bodies
CALE
And doesn’t know who to trust any
more
OLIVIA
We gotta get to him before Griffin
does
CALE
How

Olivia and Jarvis stare straight into Cale’s face

CALE (contd)
You can’t be serious

OLIVIA
You’re the only one he knows

CALE
He’1l blow my head off when I go up
for oxygen

OLIVIA
I’1l cover you

BLACK AND WHITE QUICK FLASH

57

Cale runs from an onslaught of bullets
BACK TO SCENE
Cale rubs his hand through his hairtakes out his gun

OLIVIA (contd)
It’s now or never

Cale rises up from behind their cover The shots are
ratcheted up again from the window of a building

Olivia fires in the general direction of the shots
Fiercely

Cale dives and rolls on the ground Leaps to his feet Fires
a few shots Takes off On all fucking cylinders Like a
wounded John Rambo

INT SMALL BUILDING -- DAY

Frank kneels on one leg as he aims with a M-16 RIFLE

BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM

Frank’s as pale as a ghost

His sweat forms a saline tributary that runs down the side
of his face towards his chin and finally ends in a small

pool on the dusty floor

A figure rocks on the balls of his feet in the comfort of
the dark

-he wears a DARK GREY HOODIE MASK Like the ones worn when
the cops busted in on The Dauphin

Frank turns and spots the outline of mask in the dark

-he spins to shoot but the awkwardness and weight of the
M-16 slows him down

The Masked Hoodie draws a gun and fires twice Then turns
away

EXT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX -- DAY

Jarvis and Olivia hear the shots in the distance

( )
58

JARVIS
That’s not a rifle

OLIVIA
Cale
INT SMALL BUILDING -- DAY

Cale slips into the room His gun pointed at Frank He scans
the room for threats Finds none

Rolls Frank over Feels for a pulse There’s none
He hears a sharp creak

Spins around quickly His gun ready to fire No one is
there

He grabs the M-16 Heads over to the window and peeks
through the scope

SNIPER SCOPE POV
Olivia and Jarvis peek out of their hiding place

Looks around at all the buildings Spots someone in the
shadows of a building For just a split second

The figure steps back out into the light Wearing a HOODIE
MASK

END SNIPER SCOPE POV

CALE
Sonofabitch

He drops the M-16 Exits the room hurriedly

EXT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX -- DAY
Cale dashes towards them

CALE
Frank’s dead

OLIVIA
What happened

CALE

I don’t know Shot twice There was
nothing I could do

( )
59

JARVIS
Where’s his rifle It would’ve been
useful

CALE

What kind of a Fed are you Don’t
you know that you’re never supposed
to go into battle with a weapon
that you’re not familiar with

JARVIS
Point Aim Shoot Oh yeahI can
see that being a challenge

OLIVIA
Forget the damn rifle Did you see
anyone

CALE

Not near Frank but I saw someone
looking down on your position from
that building over there

He points and they look up

OLIVIA
I can’t see anything It’s too
dark
CALE
I’m telling you I saw someone
JARVIS
Well who was it
CALE
I think it was Griffin
JARVIS
You think
CALE

He was wearing one of those Hoodie
Masks Who else could it be We
should get out of the open he
could be aiming at our heads now
No telling what kind of weapons
he’s got

OLIVIA
Let’s go back inside

( )
60

CALE
NO We don’t know where he’d be
coming from

JARVIS
Then where

CALE
That shed over there It’s got
almost a 360 degree view from every
angle

Jarvis and Olivia turn to examine the SHED that Cale
references

It’s like fifty yards awaybut it does allow a strategic
view of the general area

Cale scampers off towards it

OLIVIA
Cale wait

Doesn’t stop Doesn’t listen He just wants to get the hell
out of the open air

OLIVIA (contd)
Shit Come on

Jarvis and Olivia scamper off behind him

Cale comes to the door of the shed and kicks

INT SHED -- DAY
-it open

Cale rubs his temple furiously Breathes heavily Paces like
a tiger in a cage Mumbles to himself Agitated Stressed

The others make it inside

The three of them engage each other with a defeated look
Their eyes tell of the doubt that lingers in the room as to
their chances of survival

They lean against the walls of the rickety shed Cale looks

through the several slits of rotten wood that provide ideal
views

( )
61

OLIVIA
We’re forgetting one person left
that we haven’t considered
Kentish

JARVIS
Kentish He’s probably dead

CALE
What are you thinking

OLIVIA
I’m not sure but I’m not fitting
Griffin with this It just doesn’t
feel right

JARVIS
Everything points to Griffin being
the killer

OLIVIA
Because we know Griffin’s file
backwards Obsessive compulsive
behavior prone to violence
excessive force He’s not our
favorite guy

JARVIS
What’s your point

OLIVIA
Think Griffin runs the squad but
who actually runs the precinct

CALE
Kentish He runs the whole
department Friends with all the
City Council members the Mayor
all the important people in New
Orleans

OLIVIA
Kentish could use our distrust of
Griffin to pop up somewhere and
finish us It’s like sleight of
hand Magicians do it all the time

CALE

So keep our attention focused on
Griffin--

( )
62

JARVIS
While Kentish is the real killer

OLIVIA
How did the squad know that The
Dauphin had fifteen million in his
house

The others shrug

OLIVIA (contd)
It had to be from Kentish A man
like him who worked the streets for
all these years would have had
scores of informants where he could
have gotten that information

JARVIS
No way This is Griffin all the
way

CALE

Just before we were about to hit
The Dauphin Griffin mentioned
something about Kentish being in on
the cut I was actually surprised
when I saw him here He normally
doesn’t make it out into the field

OLIVIA
Because he had a vested interest in
taking out our made up informant
remember Kentish could be the
puppet master It fits

JARVIS
I’m not buying it Sorry

Jarvis turns his head away from on of the wall slits to
debate the idea when

A slew of bullets cut through the shed They rip into
Jarvis He falls to the floor Lays still no movement
whatsoever

Cale pounces on Olivia

The bullets continue to disintegrate the shed’s rotten wood

Cale kicks open a loose board on ground level He drags
Olivia with him
EXT SHED -- DAY

-and squeezes through to the other side

EXT

INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXSOUTH END -- DAY

They run as fast as they can

The Masked Hoodie charges forward like the Tasmanian Devil

Cale and Olivia dive behind loads of scrap metalas
bullets fly over their heads

Masked Hoodie continues to fire

The hunt is on

OLIVIA
Jesus What do we do

CALE
(looks around frantically)
We can’t stay here that’s for damn
sure We can take cover in that
building over therethrough the
door

OLIVIA
That door could be locked or
barricaded for all we know

CALE
If we stay here Liv we’re as good
as dead Do you hear me Fuckin’
dead

She nods soberly

CALE (contd)

(punches in a clip into his

Sig Sauer)
I‘ll fire at him to give you cover
You run your ass off to the door
Make sure you take out the hinges
just in case it really is locked
and ram it with everything you got
When you’re in you cover me and
I‘ll follow Start shitting your
pants if you understand me

Olivia looks towards the wooden shed which is now a tomb for
Jarvis’ body

( )
64

CALE (contd)
(shakes her violently)
Olivia

OLIVIA
I fucking got it okay

CALE
Then go

She sprints for the doorway

Cale rises above his shield of scrap junkand fires away
at the Masked Hoodie

Olivia scampers like a fox Falls Gets back up Keeps
running

She attempts to shoot at the door’s hinges but her piece
jams up on her

OLIVIA
Shit

She gains more momentum
OLIVIA
(shouts wildly)
CAAAAAALE

Cale turns and fires off a quick burst at the doorway like
an expert marksmanand dives for cover

Olivia rams the doors with her kneesand falls inside She
lays on the grounded door
INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BUILDINGSOUTHWEST END -- DAY

She resumes a stance by the doorway changes magazine clips
in her gun and fires at the Masked Hoodie

Pauses long enough for Cale to join her

They tear through the abandoned building at full speed

INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BUILDINGMAINTENANCE ROOM -- DAY
It’s dark and filthy
The pair leans against the stagnant machinery

Olivia slumps to the floor

( )
65

CALE
Hey we can’t stop We gotta keep
movin’
OLIVIA
(cries)

Ican’t stop thinking about
Jarvis You saw what was done to
him He’s gone He’s dead He’s
fucking dead

CALE

And there’s nothin’ we can do for

him now But I need you to hold on

Just hold on

OLIVIA
(pounds onto Cale’s chest)

Fuck you If not for you fucking

cops we wouldn’t be in this mess

You can add Jarvis to the others

who’re all probably dead So just

do me a favor and go to hell
He tries to comfort her She shoves him off
He hears something
Cale clamps his hand around her mouth
They listenfootsteps Someone’s coming
They spot a doorway in the room and scramble for it as
quietly as they can
INT WAREHOUSE STORAGE ROOM -- DAY
It’s a storage room filled with all manner of mechanical
riff raff and oddities from rusty wheel gears to sheet

metal

They scramble inside Olivia uses the light from her cell
phone to guide them

They duck behind a MILLING MACHINE just as
--a STROBE OF LIGHT cuts through the Storage Room

Someone in a Hoodie Mask and black leather coat is behind
the light

There’s nothing but silence now

( )
66

Olivia peaks her head out She watches the Masked Hoodie
walk off in another direction She hardly seems to be
breathing at all
BLACK AND WHITE QUICK FLASH
Masked Hoodie searches for Cale and Olivia
BACK TO SCENE
CALE
(whispers excitedly to her)

LivI’ve seen thisbefore

Olivia’s eyes are red with anger She places a finger to her
lips to signal Cale to be quiet

Cale sits with his back to the Milling Machine He pulls out
his piecetries to replace the magazine clip

CA-CLICK

In this place the sound is enough to wake the fucking
dead

The light quickly goes to their general direction

Olivia turns around quickly If looks could kill Cale seems
apologetic

Masked Hoodie slowly bears down on the Milling Machine He
looks behind it

--no one is there
He resumes his desperate search

Cale and Olivia hug the side of the room Against the wall
Tight They creep as slowly as they can

Cale eyes Masked Hoodie as he searches the room with his
flashlight Cale stops and goes for his gun

There’s a murderous glint in Cale’s eyes

Olivia turns to Cale with his gun and about to pull the
trigger Cale looks at her She nods

Cale steadies his aim His finger squeezes the trigger He
doesn’t realize that the safety is still

CLICK

Cale and Olivia duck down towards the floor

( )
67

Masked Hoodie whips around and points the light in their
direction Only the wall is illuminated

Olivia and Cale finds themselves slithering on the
groundthey slide under a FORKLIFT MACHINE with it’s front
raised mere inches in the air

Masked Hoodie walks towards them

He charts the light around but not directly downward at his
feet where Cale and Olivia have a good view of his shins

Masked Hoodie turns slowly around all three hundred and
sixty degrees he’s allowed Pointing the light at every
manner of thing that looks like a person or good hiding
place

His flashlight flickers on and off He slaps it with his
hand It still flickers

He kneels to the floor inches from Cale and Olivia
Taps the flashlight on the floor

It flickers some more The on again off again flashlight
illuminates their faces mere inches from him

All he has to do is turn his head to the LEFT
He stays on the floor The flashlight remains on

He turns his head to the RIGHT Aims the flashlight on
ground level Sweeps it around generously Sees nothing

Cale and Olivia sweat profusely Not wanting to move but
knowing that he could just as easily look their way Cale
goes for his gun once more flicks off the safety

Thena noise comes from outside the room Sounds like
someone fell into some sheet metal

And just like that Masked Hoodie goes to his feet and runs
away Heads for the door and leaves

Cale slumps his head to the ground

CALE (contd)
I can’t take much more of this

OLIVIA
He may be waiting for us to show
ourselves We should stay here for
a while

Cale tries to slow his breaths per minute ratio and closes
his eyes

FLASH TO WHITE

DREAM SEQUENCE--

INT SMALL BATHROOM -- DAY
Hot steam rises from the tub Cale walks forward

Reddish water overflows from it It crashes to the ground
and corrupts the integrity of WHITE FLOOR TILES

It flows freely to the feet of Cale

He just stands there as we hear the water hitting the floor
He looks terrified

Reaches for the shower curtain that partially hides his
father’s face

He yanks it open
ONCE AGAIN CALE FINDS HIS FATHER DEAD

END DREAM SEQUENCE

INT WAREHOUSE STORAGE ROOM -- NIGHT

Cale is jolted up in shock Olivia puts a finger to her lips
to let him knowBE QUIET

Tries to shake the cobwebs from his head

OLIVIA
Bad dream

CALE
The same one I keep having About
the old man

OLIVIA
If I’d found my father’s body after
he’d killed himself I’d probably
go crazy

Cale looks away embarrassed

( )

CALE
A couple days before he died Said
he’d found peace with God Said he
was a changed man

OLIVIA
Never figured him for the type

CALE
It was all bullshit as far as I was
concerned But it’s strange I’ve
had that same dream of him in the
bathtub a couple of times since
that night with The Dauphin Ever
since The Dauphin’s woman chanted
that nonsense

OLIVIA
Wait a minute The Dauphin’s
girlfriend chanted something What

was it
CALE

I don’tI don’t remember--
OLIVIA

Cale Think What did she say

CALE
I don’t know

He gets up and heads out of the Storage Room Uses his

cellular to light his way

Olivia follows cautiously

INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BUILDINGASSEMBLY ROOM -- NIGHT

Cale and Olivia scamper behind machines and peek their heads

out looking for any signs of danger

OLIVIA
I think she cursed you

CALE
What What are you talking about

OLIVIA
(beat)
The Dauphin’s woman I think she
cursed you and maybe that has
something to do with your recurring
dreams

( )
70

They crouch below a WINDOW to obscure themselves from any
eyes on the outside

CALE
I don’t believe in that shit
Olivia you know that

OLIVIA
Fine Indulge me What did she say

Cale gives her a nasty look
CALE
Something about the fucking dead
Raising themsome shit like that
I don’t know

Olivia’s eyes growCale notices her fear

OLIVIA

You have to remember what she said
CALE

Why
OLIVIA

Because it’s important Because I
asked you to Because I say so

Cale ignores her with a shake of the head

OLIVIA (cont’d)

(beat)

Caleit’s okay if it freaked you
out--

CALE
It didn’t So can we fucking move
on

OLIVIA
Jesus okay It didn’t freak you
out
(beat)

So what exactly did she say

Cale looks at her painfully Knows she won’t give it up
Agitated Rubs his hand through his hair

CALE
I shall raise up the dead and they
shall eat the living I shall make
the dead outnumber the living

( )
71

Olivia swallows in fear

OLIVIA
Areare you sure

CALE
Of course I’m sure I’1l never
forget that fucking night

Cale takes out his gun and walks into a dark room Olivia at
his back as they cover each other and make their way to
another doorwhispering quietly

OLIVIA
Have you experienced any strange
stuff happening to you lately

He doesn’t want to answer

OLIVIA (cont’d)
Now’s not the time to be a pain in
the ass

CALE
OkayI’ve had these feelings of
precognition visions of shit
happening and then it happens and I
feel like I know that it should
have happened but I couldn’t stop
it Like deja vu

She stops
OLIVIA
Precognition Deja vu Wait a
second Is that what you were
trying to tell me when we were
hiding earlier
CALE
Get back in formation
She does

CALE (contd)
Let me guess You’re gonna tell me
that means something right

OLIVIA
Actually I don’t know anything
about that stuff But was there
anything else Anything
supernatural Spiritual Spooky

( )
72

They make it to the end of the room

He rubs a hand through his hairshe hangs waiting for his
every word Almost seems to sense that he has experienced
something

CALE
(beat)
Normally I don’t pay much attention
to this type of thing but lately
I’ve been getting the distinct
impression I’m beingwatched

OLIVIA
By whom

CALE
I don’t know It’s just a feeling
Couple of times I could have sworn
there’s this dark shade like
presence around me but I just
brushed it off as my mind playing
tricks Whenever I encounter it it
triggers the damned visions

Olivia puts her hand to her mouth

CALE (contd)
What the hell is wrong now

OLIVIA
Have you ever heard of a
‘revenant’

He shakes his head

A loud noise comes from not too far off They go silent and
take out their weapons

No one or nothing comes

OLIVIA (contd)
Nana used to speak of them often A
‘revenant’ is French for a spirit
who’s returned to the land of the
living to torment others or be
tormented I think the priestess
did something to bring your
father’s spirit back to haunt you

Cale looks at her stunned

( )
73

CALE
I don’t have time for this shit

OLIVIA
Listen to me You said you felt
like a shadowy presence hounded you
right

CALE
So

Olivia slowly closes her eyes

OLIVIA
When I was eighteen I was visiting
Nana during spring break

CUT TO

FLASHBACK

EXT HOUSE PORCH -- DAY

A TEENAGE OLIVIA stands behind AN OLD WOMAN as she rocks
away in a rickety old rocking chair

OLIVIA (VO)
--we were talking on the porch
about this and that and how my
first year of college was going
Anyway she was sitting in her
rocking chair and I was standing
behind her

A whisper that calls to her comes from deep inside the
house

Teenage Olivia whips her head around quickly

OLIVIA (VO)
Suddenly I got the feeling that
someone was watching us I heard a
voice call my name so I turned to
look toward the hallway behind me
And there it was in the doorway of
the hall bathroom

INT HOUSE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

An ominous figure of a human being except all shaded in
BLACK looks towards her

It’s like a fuzzy black Seems to both blend and not blend
with the shadows

It looks directly at Olivia

OLIVIA (VO)
It was a black figure A kind of
living shadow I could see it’s
chest area moving up and down as
though it was breathing

INTERCUT BETWEEN PORCH AND HALLWAY

Teenage Olivia turns and covers her mouthbut then turns
back around

OLIVIA (VO) (cont’d)
I turned away for a second not
believing what I had seen then
turned back

She barely catches a glimpse of the creature as it walks
inside another room

She moves towards itas the Old Woman mumbles away

OLIVIA (VO) (cont’d)
It moved to the spare bedroom on
the opposite side So not wanting
to tell Nana I slipped away as she
kept on talking and went towards it
to find out exactly what ‘IT’ was
Id heard Nana speak of Shadow
People before but I’d never taken
her seriouslyuntil that
moment

INT SPARE ROOM -- NIGHT

Teenage Olivia walks into the spare roomturns on the
light

It’s a small room with no windows Only thing in there is a
small cot and a few pieces of wooden furniture

Nothing No one She looks up and down She finally moves
towards the closet Steadies her hand on the doorknob

( )
75

»and yanks it open

She nearly leaps out of her skin when an OLD IRONING BOARD
with some MEN’S CLOTHING falls out towards her

She looks inside the tiny closet Nothing

She breathes a heavy sigh and stuffs them all back inside
the closet

INT CLOSET -- NIGHT

As she closes the closet doorwe can hear her footsteps
walk away The light switch is flicked off and the small
sliver of light that peaks under the closet doorway is now
gone

Nothing but silence

-then we see TWO EYES AGAINST THE BLACKNESS OF THE CLOSET
INTERIOR AS THEY SHOOT OPEN

END FLASHBACK--BACK TO SCENE

Cale opens a door and peeks insideanother fucking room

INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BUILDINGMECHANICAL ROOM -- NIGHT

They run towards the window but keep low to the ground They
settle themselves by some large OIL DRUMS

OLIVIA

A few months after that I told Nana
what I saw and she said she had
seen several of them and believed
them to be past owners of the house
whod once lived there She said
some were good And others didn’t
want her to know what they felt

CALE
So you’re saying that the shadow
thing I may or may not have been
seeing is my father

OLIVIA
Is that so crazy

Cale laughs lightly Olivia doesn’t appreciate it

( )
76

CALE
I thought ghosts appeared in
physical form and slimed people
Hell this is New Orleans spirit
capital of America but I’ve never
heard of shadow people

OLIVIA
The ghosts that people claim to see
are the ones who havent accepted
their deaths Shadow people
shades darkenings whatever you
wanna call them they’re different
and seem able to exist in this
dimension and the nextmaybe
they’ve accepted their demise and
moved on Who knows

CALE
Alrightenough of this fucking
ghost-spirit-shadow bullshit

Olivia is defiant

OLIVIA
(beat)
Just remember this the damned
don’t always suffer in pain and
tormentsometimes they suffer in
silence

CALE
Not the time for a morality lesson

She looks him straight in the eye
OLIVIA
Which would you prefer To be told
of your mistakes every day or to
have to repeat them every day

Olivia looks up above the barrel to the window ten feet up
the wall

She climbs atop a LARGE OIL DRUM BARREL to look out of it
CALE
Speaking of mistakeshow long

were you sleeping with Jarvis

She looks down at him in anger

( )
77

CALE (contd)
I saw the way he looked at you

She looks out the window

OLIVIA
(beat)
He was married with two kids When
I found out he wanted to leave his
family for meI ended it

CALE
Motherfuck--and you wanna bust my
balls over cheating and you were
doing it

OLIVIA
He made me feel needed I don’t
expect you to understand

CALE
(beat)
Just when I thought--

OLIVIA
What What did you think That just
because I gave you a pity fuck that
we were gonna get back together

The look on his face says she’s lost some of the luster she
always carried or maybe it’s jealousy

She notices the disapproval on his face Tries to ignore it
She climbs down the oil drum

OLIVIA (contd)
Maybe we should try to make a run
for that roof over there Try to
get a cell phone signal again

CALE
(beat)
Whatever

EXT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX -- NIGHT
Cale and Olivia exit through the doorway of the building

Run alongside itand run for the doorway of another
building

INT INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX BUILDINGSTAIRWAYS -- NIGHT

Cale and Olivia scramble up the stairs

EXT BUILDING ROOFTOP -- NIGHT
Cale and Olivia slump over exhausted Wheeze heavily
They take out their cell phonessearch for a signal

CALE
What do you got

OLIVIA
Nothing Goddammit The
sonofabitch’s probably using some
sort of jamming device

They wave the phones around in the air Desperate Trying to
pick up a signal

Suddenly several thumps come from the other side of the
doorway that leads to the roof

OLIVIA (cont’d)
What now

CALE
Let’s not find out

They crawl to the edge of the building and look over
looking for a way off the roof

A barrage of slugs drop onto the rooftop

Masked Hoodie fires at Cale from the roof of an adjacent
building

Cale dives for the waist high side of the rooftop Olivia
follows him

Cale and Olivia fire back at Masked Hoodie

The DOOR to the rooftop gets battered from the other side
It’s going to give way any second now

CALE (contd)
Shit

Olivia empties the clip from her piece Puts the safety ON
Takes out another clip

( )
79

CALE
Hurry

She drops the clip accidentally The door is about to give
way from the constant blows on the other aside

She looks up at the door Any minute now
CALE
Ill take care of the bastard above
us No matter who comes through
that door you have to take them
out
She nods again Frantically
Cale fires up at Masked Hoodie who moves out of the way

The noise on the door is maddening

Olivia aims her weapon Ready to fire Quickly she checks
the safety Realizes she left it on

FLORES
Shit

The door flies openOlivia turns the safety OFF and fires
at the newcomer

BLAM BLAM

He drops Double tap to the head

She lowers her gun

But something’s not right She scrambles over to the person
Turns him overit’s JARVIS

His KEVLAR VEST has four bullet holes Apparently he wasn’t
killed in the shed Just unconscious Was coming to help

them

She grimaces in pain Volcano wants to erupt inside her but
she keeps it contained

She looks over at Cale Cale just stares back blankly
doesn’t know what to say

BLACK AND WHITE QUICK FLASH
Jarvis gets shot in the head

BACK TO SCENE

Masked Hoodie leaps off the top of the building and lands on
another roof top much closer to them

He drops to the ground in pain but manages to fire wildly at
Cale

CALE
Hold on

Cale grabs Olivia and jumps

EXT BUILDING -- NIGHT

--over the side of the building with her They land in a
garbage dumpster

They scramble out before Masked Hoodie can get there but he
doesn’t come

They run to the edge of a building and look up

CALE
I think we’re safe

Cale turns to Olivia She’s got a gun on him He’s very calm
under the circumstances

CALE (contd)
What the hell are you doing

OLIVIA
Jarvis wasn’t killed in the shed
He had his vest on

CALE
I saw that

OLIVIA
When Jarvis wanted us to run out of
here you said no A few minutes
later we were attacked We hid in
the shed on your say so Again we
were attacked We came up here on
the roof and surprise surprise we
were also attacked In your fits of
precognition and deja vu did you
know that was where Jarvis was
gonna get killed Did you rush me
to pull the trigger

( )
81

CALE
(beat)
I didn’t know I thought he was
killed in the shed just like you

CALE (contd)
Are you working with Griffin

CALE (contd)
I don’t know what’s going on okay
Now get that goddamned thing outta
my face

OLIVIA
You’re a lying snake Just like
when we were married

CALE
I don’t believe this shit You
wanna bring up my faults now

OLIVIA
Maybe you and Griffin are in this
together

CALE

This is insane I was getting shot
at Just like you Liv Just like

Olivia pushes the gun closer to him Her finger taps the
trigger

Cale drops to his knees Desperate Scared shitless
CALE (contd)
I swear I’m not in league with
whoever that sonofabitch is You
gotta believe me I need you to
believe me
A few tears run down his cheeks

Olivia’s own eyes glaze over

CALE (contd)
Pleaseplease

She ponders this Lowers the gun

OLIVIA
I’m sorryI had to make sure

She hugs him and he squeezes her tightly A safe feeling
with each other

pinpoint

He peeks around the scrap pile
Masked Hoodie closes in

CALE
He’s getting closer

OLIVIA

OLIVIA
It’s dark enough that I might be
able to follow him when he goes
after you

( )

CALE
Follow me

OLIVIA
It was your idea to jump him

CALE
What if we’re wrong What if
there’s more people What about

Kentish And Griffin’s actually

eyelidthen a smile grows on the corners of his mouth

BACK TO SCENE

Olivia trembles in her fear as she puts the hypothesis
together

OLIVIA
You’re lying You killed the others
because you wanted the money for
yourself You killed everyone

GRIFFIN
You don’t know anything When
Cale’s father heard of the case
they were building on The Dauphin
he decided enough was enough The
old man was on the verge of
confessing his and Cale’s drug
operation to the Feds Cale had to
turn somewhere for help

OLIVIA
Cale’s father

GRIFFIN
Cale brought me in on the operation
a few weeks ago when his brother
went in hiding with all of the
family’s cash He needed me to help
find Claude So he confided in me
who he was He promised me a cut of
the money to recruit the others

She continues to shake her head

OLIVIA
STOP IT JUST STOP IT

Someone approaches from the shadows
A shot rings through the air A red hole about an inch in
diameter appears on Griffin’s forehead Blood drips from it
He falls to the ground

Olivia screams out Looks up Kentish walks towards

( )

CALE
I couldn’t let any of you leave
until I was finished You

She just stares at himwould love to rip his fucking
throat out

CALE (contd)
Toss your back up away

OLIVIA
What back up--

CALE
Now

She goes to her RIGHT ANKLE HOLSTER and tosses her back up
piece aside

OLIVIA
WHY

CALE
The barbarians were at the gates
The feds were building a case and
it was just a matter of time before
someone put it all together I had
no choice Since Claude met
Cloretta he’d been going off track
She convinced him to take my money
and run My fucking money My
stupid brother plus a shit load of
cash equals disaster I had no
choice So I hired the best
professional killers aroundcops

She continues to cry her eyes out

CALE (contd)
When I realized I had my squad
mates and the two FBI agents
targeting The Dauphin’s killers all
in one area it was too good to be
true I could get rid of all of my
problems in one fucking take How
brilliant was that

You son of a bitch You put me in
the firing zone

son of a bitch I’m glad he’s dead

Kentish stirs on the ground Looks up Goes to his ANKLE
HOLSTER

Olivia watches him Cale picks up on it Cale turns and
fires into Kentish twice Stares at him Then

BLAM

Cale looks down at his chest Blood seeps through the shirt
He turns and sees Olivia with a gun

As she gets up from the ground we see the RIGHT ANKLE
HOLSTER that was recently emptied

--but now also is the LEFT ANKLE HOLSTER
Blood escapes from Cale’s mouth

CALE (contd)
You beautiful bitch

He fires into her She fires at him

She collapses on the floor

Cale drops to his knees and examines the hole in his
stomach He screams and cries out in anguish Tears cover
his face

He falls to the ground Closes his eyes

The determined cadence of footsteps hitting the concrete
floor echo strongly

--A PAIR OF BLACK HIGHLY POLISHED SHOES steps out of a
shadowy mist They walk towards Cale

With every step the entire construct of the shoes trousers
and legs seems to fluctuate from solid form to a BLACK misty
form and back to solid

The pair of shoes glides through the low burning fire and
finally comes to a halt beside Cale’s writhing body

IT’S VICTOR BISHOP IN CEREMONIAL POLICE UNIFORM or at least
the soul of him

-the black shadowy mist finally holds sufficiently to
construct a seemingly solid image of Victor’s face

( )
93

He looks down at his dying son
CALE (contd)
You Youcan’t bereal I
killed you
FLASH TO WHITE

FLASHBACK

INT SMALL BATHROOM - DAY
A GUNSHOT rings out
A HAND IS DRAPED OVER THE EDGE OF A BATHTUB

Reddish water overflows from it It crashes to the ground
and corrupts the integrity of WHITE FLOOR TILES

Cale stands there as we hear the water hitting the floor

He slowly walks forward He reaches for the shower curtain
that partially hides his father’s face

He yanks it open
His father bleeds from a gun shot wound in his temple

Cale opens his hand and we see a SMOKING GUN in it He takes
it and places it in his father’s dead hand

Moves his father’s hand close to his headthen walks away
BACK TO SCENE
Cale is now officially freaked out

VICTOR
You think that’s pain you’re
feeling You think that’s blood
Real blood

Cale yanks at the wallpaper It peels away stubbornly
Jarvis helps him There’s a lit fire under their asses to
uncover what’s underneath it all

actually a message

only allowed to do so much

Cale goes into shock
CALE

Cale’s breaths get more and more strenuous
Until he too starts to evaporate into a dark mist
VICTOR
You have to accept it or you’ll be
stuck in this cycle I’m afraid
hell really is repetition

He walks away from the remnants of Cale’s spiritual body It
finally turns to mist and evaporates into nothingness

Victor walks past the fire as it now rages towards the
building where he slips inside the rich blackness

-asS the darkness drifts over him
FADE TO BLACK
SILENCE

THEN A RACING HEARTBEAT

INT TRAILER BEDROOM -- DAY

Cale awakens in a panic

A CD PLAYER’S alarm goes ape-shit with a noisy rock track
KNOCKS OVER A GLASS OF WATER AS HE REACHES FOR IT

He looks at the overturned glass curiously It seems
familiar somewaysomehow

He shakes it off and slumps back down into his soaking wet
bed
EXT STREET ALLEY -- DAY

From nowhere he’s pushed onto a wall by a BLACK HOODED
FIGURE

There’s also a REVOLVER now attached to Cale’s head
