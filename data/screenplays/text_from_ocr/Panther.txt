PANTHER

Screenplay by
Melvin Van Peebles

BLACKOUT
The SCREEN stands BLACK like a chalkboard or a grave

A SOUND builds like a RADIO surfing channels Snippets of
SONGS -- Joan Baez Blowin in the Wind James Browns I
Feel Good The music of a different time

FOOTAGE

IMAGES hit the screen ROSA PARKS Peace Demonstrators
stuffing FLOWERS in the barrels of National Guard rifles
Protesters in Birmingham rallies on the White House Lawn

Mixed in with the MUSIC comes NEWS BITES -- quick catchwords
of 60s turmoil -- More troops to Vietnam Bus Boycott
Sit ins Draft Dodgers Malcolm X speaking

Then a SINGLE PHOTO settles on screen -- a ROW of BLACK
PANTHERS fists raised standing defiantly together

The IMAGE FREEZES

VOICE
(over)
The Black Panthers

As the PHOTO FADES LIGHTS APPEAR A SHAPE takes form The
BAY BRIDGE arcs over silent water spanning two worlds

VOICE
(over)
People still ask me how it all
started How things went so far And
like a lot of questions about the
Panthers there are different answers
Different beginnings

Rising behind the voice the noise of a CROWD can be heard

VOICE
(over)
What became the Black Panthers really
started with just two guys -- Bobby
Seale and Huey Newton -- saying two
words Defend Yourselves Legend
has it they met at some coffee house
where Bobby was running down a

rhyme

EXT COFFEE SHOP (BLACKWHITE) - 1966 - DAY
TITLE MARCH 17 1965
BOBBY SEALE -- a skinny kinetic black man sporting an Afro --

teeters on a chair in front of a small CROWD He reads from
a crumpled sheaf of papers

At the side of the crowd HUEY NEWTON -- well-built magnetic
watches grooving on the rhythm of the words

BOBBY
Oh yeah Yeah its easy to see right
on your black and white TV Black
man Blue cop Red blood Niggers
watch other niggers die Thats right
Niggers watching niggers die Thats
the American way

A COMMOTION starts at the rear of the crowd TWO UNIFORMED
COPS roughly make their way to Bobby They pull him off his
chair cracking his head against the ground

The cop over Bobby raises his NIGHTSTICK
A BLACK HAND grabs the club stopping its arc

Shocked the cop turns Its HUEY With honed precision he
DECKS the cop with his free hand

CUT TO
INT POLICE CAR (BLACKWHITE) - 1966 - DAY

holds tight ignoring her DRESS rising in the wind The BOY
ogles her juicy thighs

a rag tag little group battered locked down SLOCUMS there

Coming fully awake Judge realizes SOMEONE is speaking Its
HUEY his voice powerful and arresting in its urgency

HUEY
(over)
The power structure locks the black
man up Thats right We move from
chains to bars and locks Kangaroo
courts put brothers in jail No jury
of our peers No jury of black folks
How do we stop this insanity Its
simple Organization Thats the

key We must organize We must
maintain discipline

Judge peers through the bodies and sees HUEY

TYRONE
Thats right brother listen and
learn

HUEY

The white power structure wants us
to act like savages

(a smile)
But were a different kind of animal
altogether Were Panthers And The
Black Panther Party for Self Defense
is very painfully aware that America
has historically reserved its most
barbaric treatment for non-white
people since the beginning of the
country So we need to organize we

(a charismatic smile)
keep our shit correct And effect
revolution We revolve the power
into the hands of the people Where
it belongs

(a beat)
Power to the people baby

GENE
Power Shit old folks cant even
sing without getting their asses
kicked

HUEY
Well then like the man said Maybe
its time we stop singing and start
swinging

CARTER
Yeah but they got the guns

Something -- some inexplicable mixture of mirth raw
intelligence and fierce willpower -- crosses Hueys face
HUEY

We can change that We got the right
to bear arms so Id say its time
to exercise that right Like Comrade
Mao says Justice through power
Power through guns

RODGERS
Hmmm As you know the Bureau -- and
Mr Hoover -- is particularly

sensitive to anything that might
agitate or solidify the coloreds on
the left

Carmichaels speaking style is unique his slow low-key drawl
underscoring the incendiary nature of the words

CARMICHAEL
We say that Huey P Newton is a
prisoner of war Many people say
that thats not true Or that the
Party is exaggerating I think its
clear its crystal clear that the
United States has declared war on
Black people She did that when she
took the first black man from Africa

The Crowd ROARS in approval raising Black FISTS

CARMICHAEL
Now of course she never came out
and said the words I declare war
on Black people She did not do that
Well now the United States to this
day has not declared war on Vietnam
but there is Vietnam They did not
declare war on North Korea but they
fought in North Korea And they did
not declare war against the Indians
They just wiped them out

MORE applause even non-Panthers pick up on the message

CARMICHAEL
So we must define our position We
are at war Huey P Newton Minister
of Defense is our leader He is in
jail He is a prisoner of war We
must get him by any means necessary
If we cannot get him we must we
must retaliate Period

Neither your stomach or your opinion
matters here Dorsett What matters

is that Mr Trafficante and the Bureau
have come up with a solution to our
Panther Problem One might sayThe
Final Solution

TRAFFICANTE
Well put As you and Agent Rodgers
know my organization has moved into
narcotics It was decided that this
product would be confined to the
ghettos However you and your police
department has made operations in
Oakland impossible I take delivery
of shipments and they sit I -- and
my associates -- lose money Vast
sums of money Now you have some
very large problems with the Black
community

RODGERS
More like a revolution West Oaklands
turning into hostile territory

TRAFFICANTE
I assure you the pacifying properties
of Heroin are quite remarkable See
junkies politics are different from
yours and mine For them the only
Partys the next fix

DORSETT
Dealing dope And you want the
department to turn a blind eye while
you turn Oakland into a city of
zombies

TRAFFICANTE
Not the entire city just one
troublesome part
DORSETT
And what if it spreads to the rest
of the population

TRAFFICANTE
Relax Chief That will never happen
I gotta little gypsy in me Soon the
moolies gonna be too busy -- well
sell em a few guns too -- blowing
each others brains out over the stuff
to be fucking with protests Now
Ive got the product What I need is
a center of operation and someone to
oversee the movement of the product
Not one of my people but a native
someone inside the community

I dont think that will be any
problem

been decided

EJECTING the clip from the 45 and slams a fresh one in He
gets to his feet LIMPING into the DARKNESS

A NOISE sounds Judge WHIRLS firing dropping BODYGUARD 2
Judge TURNS coming eye to eye with a 45 held by a very
HIGH SABU

SABU

Pistol pushed against Judges skull Sabu moves around to
Judges side Judge DROPS the gun

SABU

Judge SPINS batting Sabus gun hand away

JUDGE

BULLETS tear through Sabu as TYRONE fires from the ground

TYRONE
Damn straight

INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Judge and Tyrone help each other up From BEHIND a CRATE
the SECOND BODYGUARD bolts toward the DOOR

GUNFIRE blares out blasting the BODYGUARD across the room
ALMA appears in the doorway

TYRONE
Alma I told you to

ALMA
(icy calm)
Fuck that weve got company

EXT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

POLICE CARS pull up in front Armed to the teeth with RIOT
GUNS half a dozen COPS take up position behind the cars

INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Alma -- hidden in the shadows -- watches the windows Behind
her Tyrone -- BADLY HURT -- leans against the wall next to
her Behind them Judge finishes pouring out the GAS CAN

ALMA
Judge hurry

Throwing that can away Judge SMILES at Tyrone

JUDGE
Hey brother you got a match

GUN SHOTS rip through the walls as the cops OPEN FIRE
EXT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Riot Guns pour lead into the building a la the Fred Hampton
massacre Today the police are taking no prisoners

Behind the POLICE RODGERS watches the mayhem SHAKING his
head Whatever the outcome the operations OVER Alone he
WALKS back to his car
INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Tyrone CRAWLS across the floor leaving a trail of BLOOD
toward Judge and Alma

JUDGE
Motherfuckers
TYRONE

hell out of here Ill keep ‘em busy

ALMA

TYRONE
(to Judge)

important than any of us

JUDGE
Well all get out of here together

TYRONE
Later for that Im done either way

Another BARRAGE of bullets rips through the walls One GRAZES
Tyrones ARM His GUN slides across the floor

The PISTOL settles ominously in front of Alma She looks
over it at Tyrone Their eyes LOCK

TYRONE
Go

Click Clack Faster than a thought Alma checks clears and
COCKS the pistol She HANDS it to Tyrone Tragic understanding
flows between them

Grabbing the pistol Tyrone SCOOTS across the floor

ALMA
Tyrone

Near the door Tyrone turns to Judge and raises his fist

TYRONE
Power to the people

EXT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

FLAMES leaping up behind him TYRONE pure defiance steps
out and FACES the cops
The IMAGE FREEZES GUNFIRE cuts through the air The moment
is frozen in time in history in legend Slowly the IMAGE
dissolves Fading into
EXT PANTHER HEADQUARTERS
SUPERIMPOSED over the WAREHOUSE FLAMES the bullet-riddled
posters of HUEY and LITTLE BOBBY stare out like a legacy
or a warning

CUT TO
EXT CLOSE-UP SIDEWALK - DAY

CONCRETE cracked and dirty fills the frame A SMALL FOOT
steps onto the pavement

EXT 55TH AND MARKET - DAY

A STOPLIGHT hangs at the once deadly intersection SCHOOL
KIDS wait at the corner The light CHANGES and they step
safely into the street

JUDGE
(over)
The community got the streetlight
finally But the way I see it

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK A TITLE APPEARS

IN 1970 THERE WERE 300000 ADDICTS IN THE US YESTERDAY
THERE WERE 3 MILLION

JUDGE
(over)

The struggle continues

THE END
