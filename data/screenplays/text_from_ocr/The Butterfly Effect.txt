Mrs Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and

out a drawing Andrea turns to stone when she sees it

ANDREA
I dont understand Evan did this

The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while
standing on a heap of dead bodies Its extremely
sophisticated for a seven-year old Some of the corpses
been cut open and the insides are surprisingly

correct

Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny harmless as a

and struggles to control her concern

Lenny
EVAN

Lenny unable to stop crying begins hyperventilating
out of
control His desperate gasps for breath are
frightening
Evan scared looks around for Mrs Boswell but cannot
find
her He reaches up to his own picture and quickly tears
his
own macaroni mother apart and places it over Lennys
picture Its a nuclear family again Lenny slowly is
able
to catch his breath
LENNY
(grateful)

ANDREA
And the bad news

DR REDFIELD
Unfortunately weve got nothing to
work with Its harder playing
detective now

DR REDFIELD
If I had to guess Id say the
blackouts are stress related

But hes seven What kind of stress
can he have

DR REDFIELD
Plenty Who knows Maybe hes got
severe coping problems about not
having a father Did you say the
last blackout occurred when he was

simple

DR REDFIELD
Youd be surprised how often they
are

A popular watering hole A dark rustic interior
blasting
alternative rock

Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to
their
tables

Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women
HEIDI

beautiful wears ripped jeans no make up She sinks
the

eleven ball off the rail KRISTEN coolly smokes a
cigarette

confident that she and Heidi will hold the table

KRISTEN
So which one of you has a pet
worm

Thumper proudly steps forward

THUMPER
Worms plural

KRISTEN
Thats so gross
Thumper steps back points to Evan

THUMPER
Talk to him about it hes got the
fetish

Heidi sinks another ball and looks up at Evan
strangely

EVAN
Actually theyre for a psych project
A study on memory

Heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to Evan

HEIDI
(stifling a yawn)
Shit better explain before all the
excitement gives me a heart attack

Evan speaks as he knocks the one-ball in the corner

pocket
As he talks at a table behind them some obnoxious

Greeks
including HUNTER SPENCER and GWEN make fun of

Thumper

EVAN
Its an experiment with flatworms
and a maze You take a flatworm and
run it through the maze until hes
memorized it Then you put a new
flatworm in the maze Hes clueless
Banging into walls getting lost
whatever

THUMPER
(thoughtfully)
Like Ozzy

Gwen giggles as Spencer throws popcorn at Thumpers
head

SPENCER
Ten bucks says he eats it off the
floor

Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks

the
three-ball in the side
EVAN
You chop up the smart flatworm and
feed it to the dumb one and presto
the dumb one suddenly knows the maze
inside and out

Evan walks past Heidi putting his hand on her shoulder
to

squeeze by The hand lingers longer than necessary and
Heidi

doesnt mind He sinks another ball

EVAN
Just by absorbing the first worm
into its cellular structure it gets
all of the worms memories

THUMPER
(thoughtfully)
Thats probably why Hannibal Lecters
so smart

A handful of popcorn hits Thumpers face They all try
to

ignore Hunter and Spencers jeers

HEIDI
So whats the point

EVAN
(setting up the eight)
Maybe if I can figure out how the
memories of a simple worm function
itll help me understand the
complexities of the human brain

Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumpers jacket
Although

his hand clenches on the cue He meekly shuffles away
to the

opposite side of the pool table from the cackling
Greeks

HEIDI
(intrigued)
So are you planning on becoming a
doctor or something

Thumper casually takes the pool cue from Evan

EVAN
No I just dont want to lose my
mind

As Heidi digests this Thumper carefully lines up his

shot

The eight ball

CRASH The cue ball intentionally jumps the table
rocketing

into the pitcher of beer on the Greeks table Theyre
all

soaked with beer and debris

Just as they begin to rise Thumper smashes the cue
stick on

the table WHISTLING innocently (while now brandishing
a

spear) They sit the fuck down

Kristin impressed casually wraps her arm around
Thumpers
waist He smiles coolly its nothing

Why do you ask

EVAN
No its just weird with him being
such a brain and all I just wondered
if he was ever able to remember stuff
hed forgotten
room

quietly

ANDREA
When he was around your age almost
exactly your age He said he figured
out a trick to remember the past

Evan tries not to react

ANDREA
I couldnt tell if they were real
memories or just phantoms You know
he might only have thought he actually
remembered them

EVAN
Sure

ANDREA
And then just before it got so bad
that he had to be committed he said
that he could

KAYLEIGH
(shaking her head)
She had a new family Not enough
space for me Said I should have
They walk

in silence for a moment

EVAN
Actually Kayleigh the reason I

KAYLEIGH
(brightening)
Me Are you kidding Why

EVAN
Remember when I was a kid I had all
these blackouts

KAYLEIGH

back To ask a lot of stupid questions
about Robin Hood

EVAN
No but I think something really bad
mightve happened to us

Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette

KAYLEIGH
Is there a point to any of this

Evans features shift from inquisitory to tenderness
He

steps closer to Kayleigh and softly strokes her face
She

flinches at first but remains in the same spot

EVAN
Whatever happened it wasnt our
fault You know we couldnt have
stopped it

Kayleigh begins to tremble Tears flow

EVAN
Look Kayleigh This may sound like
bullshit coming from a guy who hasnt
spoken to you in seven years

She moves her face away from his hand

EVAN
But you were seven years old and
theres nothing you couldve done to
deserve

Her face collapses and she turns away

KAYLEIGH
(defeated)
Just shut up Evan Youre wasting
your breath

Evans face is flushed with rage He walks behind

and cups his hands tightly around her ears She cant

What time is it

MR MILLER
Its time for you to stand where the
hell I told you

EVAN
Wrong answer fuckbag This is the
very moment of your reckoning In
the next thirty seconds youre going
to open one of two doors The first
door will forever traumatize your
own flesh and blood

The mature speech seems completely surreal coming from
seven-year old Mr Miller looks around the room as if
the butt of some sick joke
MR MILLER
(stunned disbelief)

Whats happened to -- How are you
doing that
EVAN

(voice rising)
Itll change your daughter from a
beautiful child into an empty shell
whose only concept of trust was
betrayed by her own sick pedophile
father Ultimately itll lead to
her suicide Nice work daddy

Evan impatiently waves the question

A sinister victory smile

EVAN
Rot in hell you fucking animals

Kayleigh and Lenny walking by his side do a double
Evan shrugs just kidding and looks around getting
bearings He whips his hand out and stops them

EVAN
Wait Before we --

He suddenly notices Kayleigh who now no longer looks an
awkward and unkempt tomboy but rather a vibrant and

young girl Whereas her clothes were loose and
before she is now radiant and wears fashionable
Evan remembers his mission and darts over to a JUNK
EVAN
We need something to cut open the

sack

Kayleigh and Lenny stare at him concerned for his
Evan roots through the trash until he finds something

a
razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long Evan
offers
it to Lenny
EVAN
I want you to take this Lenny
Todays your day of atonement I
know how guilty you feel about that
woman and her baby --

Evans words hit home and Tommys anger slowly

look of understanding passes between them Gratitude

Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it Lenny
screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell With all
the force he can muster he jams the metal shard all
through Tommys throat

Tommy clutches his throat gagging in blood Evan

the scene in shock

EVAN
Oh fuck Lenny no

Lenny drops to the floor Indian style wipes the dirt
his hands and freezes up completely Kayleigh wakes up
SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from Tommys throat
Meanwhile Crockett escapes from the sack

then
her eyes fill with distrust and contempt

Evans temper flares and he picks up a chair and

against a wall above Thumpers head

EVAN
Im not saying it again

Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the
and leave Alone in the room Evan looks under his bed
breathes a sigh of relief to see all of his journals
intact He sifts through them again He finally finds
passage he needs Something catches the corner of
eyes and he turns to examine it
To the left of Thumpers Buddha statuette sits a large
CANDLE that bears a portrait of Jesus Christ

to get a better view
Evan rummages in the bureau and finds the wooden

Miller

knocks the blockbuster from Evans hand and it rolls
towards

the other side of the room resting peacefully against
