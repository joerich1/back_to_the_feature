FADE IN

EXT SHANGHAI (THE BUND) - DAY

Faintly heard the SOUND of an English Boys Church Choir
We are looking at the distant skyline of the Shanghai Bund
seen across the expanse of the dirty fast-moving Huangpu
River

Nearer the surface glitter of the water is broken up by
floating objectswhich turn out to be first of all
flowers scattered singly and in garlands flowing by with
the tide tumbling about in the wash of the cargo ships and
motorized junks which we have seen in the background

Inside the shot after we have seen the first coffin there
is a caption

In 1941 China had been at war with Japan for four years and
a Japanese army of occupation controlled the area around
Shanghai Inside the cit thousands of Westerners lived

in the diplomatic security of the International Settlement
their war was still half a world away The day which was to
change everything dawned at Pearl Harbor on December 7th but

in Shanghai on the other side of the Pacific Date Line that
Sunday morning was still the last day of the peace

We are still with the SO of Lo oys AM

The Europeans built the church and you wouldnt know you
were in China There is nobody walking around because
anyone who belongs here is inside at worship The
WORSHIPPERS cars and limousines are waiting to take them

home Each car has a CHAUFFEUR and it is the chauffeurs
when we see them who show us that we are not in Surrey

We start to take a special interest in one of the cars a
new Packard and in its chauffeur who is called YANG

INT SHANGHAI CATHEDRAL (CHOIR STALLS) DAY

The SOUND TRACK comes home now as we see the boy
CHORISTERS in full throat

In good time for the Amen we come in close to one of the
boys and this is our introduction to JIM aged 11 He is
hot and uncomfortable and not a very pious chorister
Singing mechanically he shifts his gaze around and uses
his fingers to leosen his collar Amen

EXT AMHERST AVENUE - DAY

The Packard continues now avoiding bicycles and pedestrians
as it passes the gateways of the European houses

Each of the gateways is the territory of a BEGGAR This
perhaps barely registers until we see the Packard turn

into one of the gateways and we note the OLD DESTITUTE MAN
who sits by the gatepost in rags banging an empty cigarette-

HORNS BLARE continuously as the traffic pushes slowly

through the bicycles and rickshaws going past shops night
clubs gambling dens and a hotel

The hotel is crowned by the free-standing letters of its
name against the skyline CATHAY HOTEL

The pavements and roadway are crowded with a bewildering
mixture of pedestrians CHINESE PEASANTS going to market
with burdens of fruit and vegetables and bales of cloth hung
from yokes and STREET VENDORS selling caged songbirds live
chickens snacks of frying snakeand then outside a

cinema showing The Hunchback of Notre Dame a couple of
dozen HUNCHBACKS in medieval costume welcoming the CUSTOMERS
who are also being solicited by a few neatly dressed EUROPEAN

EXT SHANGHAI STREET CHECK-POINT DAY

The Packard is in a line of cars slowly moving through the
checkpoint This is a kind of frontier manned by BRITISH
SOLDIERS and CHINSESE POLICE There is a BRITISH ARMY
OFFICER perched on top of an armored car He is supervising
the Chinese police who are controlling the people passing
through the checkpoint in both directions

Ahead of the Packard is an open German tourer flying

The Lockwoods are well-off British residents and have an
appropriately spacious house

The CHAUFFEURS wait

Faintly heard the SOUND of children shrieking with
laughter

The main point about the Lockwood location which may be
clearer when we move to the terrace-side of the house is
that the house is at the edge of a disused airfield which
is mainly grass

EXT LOCKWOOD HOUSE (TERRACE) - DAY

INT LOCKWOOD HOUSE - DAY 31

There are perhaps 30 GUESTS Most of them are in fancy

COURTESAN an ALI BABA a CARMEN MIRANDA a CHARLIE CHAPLIN
and so on MRS LOCKWOOD dressed as Britannia is in

Jim sees his mother and Mrs Lockwood engaged in an animated
conversation with a young Lieutenant (LIEUTENANT PRICE)

Lt Price is the embodiment of the Byronic officer He is
young no more than twenty extremely handsome (a la Rupert

EXT ABANDONED AIRFIELD - DAY 36

The airfield is not in use but derelict and overgrown
with an occasional blockhouse covered in turf and wild
Sugarcane and nettles Carrying his plane Jim wades
purposefully across the field passing a burial mound with
rotting lidless coffins protruding from the earth Jim
pauses to peer into the coffins looking with interest at
the yellowing skeletons and skulls embalmed in the
tain-washed mud He moves on and reaches a crashed
Japanese fighter plane partly stripped with vegetation
growing through it the metal rusted Jim walks around the
tail pleased to see the plane and steps onto the

wing-root He puts his model plane on the wing and climbs
into the cockpit

Sitting in the cockpit Jim examines and touches what is
left of the instrument panel He mimes lifting his goggles
off his forehead over his eyes looks sideways and raises
his hand in a signal - And the sigh of the wind in the
grasses turns into the SOUND of fighter planes warming up
all over the airfield

Jim runs after it and starts climbing up the slope From
his vantage point Jim sees a FULLY-ARMED JAPANESE SOLDIER
looking up at him from a trench only a few yards away Then
he sees that there are MORE SOLDIERS sitting along the whole
length of the trenchand that there is a second trench
also full of JAPANESE SOLDIERS sitting and smoking and
glancing up at Jim He has come across a company of Japanese
infantry concealed on the old battlefield As Jim watches
a JAPANESE SERGEANT gets to his feet casually picking up his
rifle and stamping out a cigarette The sergeant climbs out
of the trench and ignoring Jim moves to start cutting off

Jim approach in the distance Jims father makes to start

The ships cutter from the British vessel is sinking in
shallow water full of WOUNDED MEN There is RIFLE FIRE
from the Japanese gunboat BRITISH SAILORS mostly
wounded are also swimming and wading from the direction of
the cutter The British vessel (The Petrel) is sinking in
mid-stream amid smoke and steam and flame

Jims father is among several BRITISH MEN who have stripped
off their jackets and are wading through the mud to meet

‘

the wounded SAILORS who are drifting and struggling towards
the shore

In the shallows the sailors collapse helplessly in the
mud as the quickening tide ripples around them

The reverse shot shows Jim struggling free from the chaos
of the Bund where JAPANESE OFFICERS and SOLDIERS are
screaming orders and lashing about and already there are
DEAD BODIES with bayonet wounds lying on the wharf

Jim jumps down into the mud and staggers towards his father
who is attempting to pull a BLOODIED YOUNG SAILOR out of

the water Jim lends a-hand and the effort exhausts both
Father and Jim

debris showers down from the exploding boat The White
Ensign still attached to its broken spar splashes down
into the water a few yards downstream

Jim wades downstream but the flag drowns before he reaches
it Smoke and steam drift to the shore enveloping him He
loses touch and sight and his sense of direction He cant
see his father anymore He wades up towards the embankment
wall The smoke thins for a moment allowing Jim to SEE a
line of Japanese infantry drawn up on the wharf with
bayonets fixed Jim struggles to reach the roadway A
CROWD OF PEOPLE are pushing along the road above his head
Jim pulls himself up and is given a helping hand by a woman
in a black robe We see then that she is a YOUNG NUN

comes forward and examines the footprints on the floor

‘puzzled by them There are the dainty footprints of a

woman and the large prints of soldiers boots It looks
like the footprint patterns in a dance manual and Jim
experimentally tries to follow the dance placing his feet
into the prints until he cant make it work He is standing
against the bed He sits exhausted on the bed and picks up
his mothers nightdress bringing it to his face and taking
comfort from its smell He lies down holding the nightdress

Jim makes his escape through the crowd and he continues 89B
across the square until he comes up against the back of a
dense crowd which is silently watching some kind of
spectacle in the open spaceand as Jim dodges and cranes
to get a glimpse we see that it is a public execution a
YOUNG MAN IN QUILTED PEASANT CLOTHES is kneeling on the
ground about to have his head severed

which he pulls away just in time The knife is held by the
youth we have seen before

Jim kicks at the youth and starts riding his bike as fast as
he can with the youth in pursuit and a few paces behind
him both of them twisting and dodging through the crowd
Jim is very frightened looking over his shoulder He turns
into an alley and loses the youth

During this dialogue Basies fingers have been busily
exploring Jims pockets delicately but persistently
Without fuss he removes Jims wristwatch Like a music
hall pickpocket Basie comes up with Jims comic book
which he looks at briefly and replaces in Jims pocket
then with Jims model Plane with which he does likewise
then a pair of sunglasses which he puts on and the half
crown coin which he holds up in front of Jims eyes between
finger and thumb and conjures out of sight

the car The driver who might be Yang is controlling the
steering wheel with his foot while a couple of gangsters
are getting the brunt of the drivers karate chops The

driver manages to ram one of his passengers against the car

ANOTHER ANGLE

We see that we are in an open air cinema which is occupied
by about 30 PRISONERS Most of the prisoners a bedraggled
line of exotic and incongruous characters lined up in the
act of receiving the remnants from a cooking pot a meager
meal of boiled potatoes being doled out into their proffered
mess tinsthe remaining guests at Lockwoods party must
have been rounded up soon after we last saw them and we
recognize the French Courtesan Charlie Chaplin the Emperor
Part of their costumes missing the Party long past peak
Some are already scraping the last of their potato from
their mess tins others are waiting to receive their share

PRISONERS mostly elderly men and women who are variously
in a bad way
EXT DETENTION CENTER (GATE) - DAY 109

At the end of the whistle the occupants of the detention
center begin to congregate near the gate They include a
faded English couple MR and MRS PYM MR PARTRIDGE

and her father and MR LOCKWOOD Meanwhile the two or

over their mouths and noses The lorry is delivering
PRISONERS to the detention center Two or three of these
prisoners are STRETCHER CASES carried by ORDERLIES

Not all of the prisoners on the lorry are made to disembark
but those who do limp or are carried through the gates

into the detention center and each one of them there is
handed a mess tin

The JAPANESE SOLDIER who is handing out the mess tins
places one on each of the stretchers as they go by One of
these stretchers contains a fairly young ENGLISH WOMAN
whose two sons PAUL and DAVID walk with her Another
arrival is an EMACIATED SOLDIER judging from his boots

and shorts which constitute his only clothing He has been
badly beaten up The new arrivals include an English
couple MR and MRS VINCENT Mr Vincent is a slight
dark ill-looking man with a tanned thin face Mrs
Vincent is attractive in an understated way blonde and
small-boned an arresting face The Vincents have
evidently been rounded-up recently--their clothing and
their general state show fewer signs of deprivation than
their companions Mrs Vincent carries a quite smart
leather purse (handbag) the kind which has a flap with a
Ppress-stud no handle Meanwhile each of the prisoners
including Jim who are hoping to be picked to depart on the

lorry stand quietly holdi their mess tins ready to hand

There is an insistent tinny banging NOISE an amplified
version of a sound we have heard before This time it is
the Europeans They have been turned into beggars They

bang their mess tins against the ground against benches
against the walls

The general view of the detention center shows the prisoners
standing lying or sitting all of them still apart from
banging their tins all of them staring silently in much the
same direction which we see is the door of the guard hut
Sergeant Uchida comes out of the guard house with a small

sack which he tosses in a general direction of the cooking-fire
where TWO CHINESE WOMEN one of them being MRS LEE by name

out of the cab and approaches the WORKING PARTY which is
gathered on the little platform in the charge of a
JAPANESE CORPORAL who sits drinking from a canteen of

‘water Ransome starts to lower the tailgate

RANSOME
Come on lets get you into some

The guard immediately impedes Ransome shouting at him

Ransome addresses the guard in tones of polite humility
which is at odds with his words

RANSOME
Look you stupid ugly filthy
little bastard these women are
getting dehydrated so whats it to
you

Through this the Guard pushes and cuffs Ransome and
continues to shout at him Ransome holds his ground
Having made his point the Guard lowers the tailgate and
shouts at the prisoners to get down The Guard turns away
and goes to join the Driver

of the UN-NAMED OLD WOMEN is close to death Jim is
drawing diagrams in the dust with a stick

A canteen of water is being passed among the Japanese
Working Party who are sharing a meal with the driver and
guard on the railway platform The Prisoners watch the
water intently the spilled drops and the dribbles catching
the sunlight

Christ are they waiting for one of
us to die 61

JIM
Theyre waiting for you to ask so
they can hit you with their rifles

Ransome stares at him rather angrily Jim gets up and
casually moves towards the platform When he gets to the
edge of the platform he climbs up ignoring the Japanese
Ransome Basie and the others watch him with interest
Mrs Vincent watches him with anxiety Basie starts
nervously playing with his lucky half crown

The driver notes Jim and is evidently talking to the
Corporal in a good humored way about Jim who bows steeply
and then stands to attention unsmiling The Corporal
laughs The Corporal part-fills a bottle of water from his
canteen and holds it up calling to Jim beckoning The
prisoners are transfixed by the sight of the water shining
in the sunlight Jim walks to the Corporal

and laughs Jim laughs with him Jim gives the bottle back
to the Corporal who now refills it to the top from his
canteen He gives it to Jim who bows again and this time
takes it to the lorry standing in front of Ransome who
has got to his feet Ransome stares briefly at Jim

JIM
(matter of fact)
It was my water

Ransome takes the bottle and Jim goes back to his place
sitting on the ground leaning against one of the wheels of
the lorry Ransome tips a little water into the mouth of
the SICKEST WOMAN and then into the mouths of two or three
Elderly Prisoners who cant move Basie reaches out for
the bottle but Ransome tips it to his own mouth first
taking a couple of gulps it seems he might take a third
gulp but finds Jim looking at him expressionlessly and
checks himself Ransome passes the bottle on Jim looks

placed inside oil drums and by their hellish light we see
DOZENS of NEARLY NAKED WORKERS scampering up and down the
slope of the embankment while carrying rocks The white
ashy dust sticks to their skin and so it appears that the
Japanese are building their runway with an army of ghosts
SENTRIES patrol the embankment and their bayonets are
silhouetted against the somber sky

behind them (because he can HEAR them) Basie jumps down
next to him

With the dissolve we SEE the image of two Kendo fighters
circling each other with helmets body armor and’ bamboo
staves suspended over the runway Suddenly the taller
fighter attacks Before his shorter opponent can make a
move he has been beaten around the arms and head The
shorter opponents helmet is knocked off his head revealing
the face of Jim an undernourished undersized over experienced
fourteen-year-old The fight has taken place in the guard
house somewhere between an office and a recreation room

An audience of THREE OFF-DUTY JAPANESE GUARDS applaud as the
victor takes off his helmet This is SEARGENT NAGATA a

all the other boys

Jim ignores them as he hurries by He turns the corner at
a crossroads where two paths meet and his flying clogs
flash by the handwritten street signs which proclaim these
paths to be Piccadilly and Bond Street As Jim runs
through the camp toward the hospital we get a view of the
distant pagoda across the airfield which is separated from
the camp by a wire fence

JIM
Use your iron

The golfers evidently take their game seriously They
glare at Jim

Jim continues his journey through the camp at his usual
speed This may be an appropriate moment to describe what
the camp is like The camp is surrounded by a wire fence
which separates it from the nearest part of the airfield

from the runway itself and conceals a narrow canal The
business end of the airfield is way across on the other
side near the pagoda)

The main entrance of the camp guarded gates gives onto a
minor road which skirts the airfield and the camp Part of
the camp is evidently older than the war There might be
about 20 double-story concrete structures large enough to
sleep one-hundred people each There is a larger structure
facing the airfield which has been part-bombed This is
an assembly hall with a balcony now open to the sky and
standing in its own rubble There are negotiable stairs up
to the balcony partly covered by debris The dormitory
blocks are regularly laid out between quite neat
rudimentary paths Their front doors each approached by a
few steps look out upon a parade ground There are

also some wooden buildings evidently purposely built for
the camp There is a guard house which accomodates the
soldiers who guard the camp There is also a watch tower
upon whose platform there is a Japanese soldier shaded by a
tin roof One of the houses is now the hospital It has a

seen a number of cots and mattresses all occupied in the
semi-gloom The only person in the dispensary is a

a clear view of the entire camp He is sitting on his
bunk dressed in a long sleeved cotton shirt faded but
neatly creased The cubicle is like a general store
clothing pots and pans tennis racquets stacks of old
magazines Jim enters in his usual state of panting
excitement Basie sits on the bed absently playing with
the half crown coin which he slips in his pocket when Jim
arrives not to hide it but Jim merely replaces the coin
as something to occupy him

flat on the cork seeing how it will work as a compass

Demarest is folding the laundry Jim brought and placing it
under Basies mattress

Jim licks the last of the potato from his fingers

JIM
(anxious)
Youve got to give it back 78

BASIE
- Got to What do you mean got to
Are you going to give me the potato
back

Jim is taken aback Demarest smiles at Jims discomfort
but Basies pendulum is still swinging He snarls at
Demarest

BASIE
What are you laughing at

And he jerks his head at Demarest indicating that he
should leave which he does

Basie is feeling expansive Jim always makes him feel
powerful He stares at Jim looking him over as if he is
going to remake him

Jim shares his room with Mr and Mrs Vincent Mr Vincent
is not present The room is divided by a makeshift partition
consisting mainly of bits of curtain etc hanging from a
line attached to nails in the walls The division is more
or less equable in the sense that the Vincents have twice
as much of the room as Jim Apart from the two cots there
is little to note in the Vincents’ Part of the room (If
there is a window the Vincents’ have it) Jims cot is
inside the partition in a cubicle hardly bigger than the
cot He has pasted photographs of shiny cars Battle of
Britain pilots standing by their Spitfires a crashed German
bomber St Pauls Cathedral one photograph torn from a
shows an unidentified couple standing arm in arm outside the
gates ef Buckingham Palace Jims only real possession is a

make-shift wooden suitcase or box In this box he keeps his
treasures

JIMS POV - THE PARTITION

made up of various bits and pieces strung and pinned together
is full of little gaps They offer Jim a view of Mrs
Vincent who is looking at her face critically without

83

vanity in the small mirror set into the inside of the flap
of her purse

Jim watches her steadily for a few moments with sympathy
but also with great curiosity His eyes switch slightly to
take in the line of her body

JIMS POV - MRS VINCENT

although there is nothing more provocative revealed of

it than the V at the neck of her shirt which she instinc-
tively and unnecessarily closes as she becomes suddenly
aware of Jims gaze

Mrs Vincent pulls the curtain open and watches Jim but
doesnt see him or notice his haircut She looks tired
and frayed but still attractive

And he hands her purse back
MRS VINCENT
You shouldnt work for Basie The

things that go on in that American

Mrs Vincent gives Jim a look but he is innocent of the
implication

JIM

Theyve got wonderful things there

MRS VINCENT
Perhaps its time you moved into the

Mr Vincent enters the cubicle with two plates of food
one of which he hands to his wife He takes two spoons out

of his pocket and they use them to separate the weevils
from the wheat

Mr Vincent doesnt reply Instead he and his wife watch
Jim balefully Jim stirs the eighty-seven weevils back
into the wheat and then takes a couple of rapid spoonfuls
Mrs Vincent almost gags at the sight

It might be a bit strange
He picks up a stray weevil on his finger and eats it

Mrs Vincent separates the weevils from the wheat with more
force than necessary

Her husband lies on his side facing the wall Suddenly the
light of a distant explosion is cast over her features A
split second later he HEARS the hard rumble of a distant
explosion (the light of the explosion always travels a
little faster than the sound in the scene)

NIGHT (MOON) Lo

Jim rushes out of the dormitory watching the sky His
expression is transcendent

JIM
All the way from Guam

A JAPANESE GUARD on the watch tower is shouting down at the
guards on ground level some of whom have emerged from the
guard house whose windows are lighted

An anti-aircraft gun aa ned“on the tép atTo of the

Nantao Pagoda opens up The reason is that a B-29
jettisoning bombs as it goes is passing over the airfield
from the direction of Shanghai and towards the camp
Prisoners and guards start running for cover Jim alone
continues to watch At the height of the NOISE of the
plane an immense black shadow passes over Jim

JIM
(awed)
My God

Then he is flung aside by an explosion as a bomb hits the
ground not too far away Then the noise ceases and Jim
picks himself up The Japanese soldiers are shouting to
each other The bomb has dropped just inside the camp
causing indirect damage by unlucky chance to several
windows of the guardhouse The watch tower is also now at
a tilt but the soldier at the top comically spared is
clinging safely to the ladder

ANGLE ON JIM 152

He looks down the bomb crater like he once looked down his

From the way the other men look at him and the way Basie
ignores him Jim deducts that he is in disgrace

After what seems to be like an eternity Basie deigns to
look at Jim and then at the golf shoes which he regards
with a particular hatred

BASIE
That was another fine way to get
yourself killed Jim
(with a last
withering glance
at the shoes)

Jim is close to tears but then Basies mood changes and he
thrusts the Yardley soap towards Jim

SOLDIERS who are tearing Cohens little cubicle to pieces
and coming up with Cohens bongo drum from under his cot
One soldier brings this triumphantly to Nagata Nagata
takes the soldiers rifle and with the butt smashes the
bongo drum to bits There is nothing inside Cohen
involuntarily steps forward to try to save his drum but he
is too late Grief stricken he rightly accuses not the
Japanese but his fellow prisoners in general

closed curtain leading to Basies cubicle watched

nervously by the other prisoners Nagata enters Basies

Basie’s clean one and sniffs the Yardleys He touches
Basies clean white shirt and looks down at Basies dapper
shoes He looks at his own army boots with their laces
broken and knotted Nagata casually kicks over the table
sending the chess pieces scattering The bowl of shaving
soap and the enamel mug have been Placed on the floor under
the box and are now revealed The mug is still foamy with
the shaving brush stuck in it Nagata takes out the shaving

a nice shave) Basie bows to Nagata

Demarest catches Jims eye switching his eyes to the
shaving mug Jim looks at the shaving mug

We see Basies surprise and relief

Nagata turns back to Basie holding the mug Basie smiles
and bows to him but its the wrong move and Nagata hits him
hard with the mug Nagata loses control and lays into

Basie with his fists until Basie goes down when Nagata
starts kicking him

Jim Mr Maxted the Vincents and other Prisoners are
standing by the wide open gates There isnt a guard in

sight anymore they have all left The prisoners are

silent and uneasy with their recent freedom (if one can
call it that)

A fire breaks out in one of the barracks by the airfield

and the red glow of the flames is reflected on the prisoners
the camp and the burial mounds outside Jim SEES something
OS He points his finger

JIM

Jim and the prisoners see THREE HORSEMEN riding up to the
camp Zigzagging between the mounds they look like the
embodiment of the apocalypse

at Mr Lockwoods party But now Lt Price is white as
chalk his chest puckered with cigarette burns and his
wrists wrapped in bloody bandages He wears a rifle across
his shoulders and his eyes are completely deranged The
two other men in his party are heavily armed Lt Price

crowd of prisoners then watch apprehensively as a very
efficient MILITARY CONVOY roars down the road and sweeps up
alongside the camp with well-dressed and well-armed soldiers
jumping out of the vehicles pouring into the camp threat-
ening figures with bayonets fixed The prisoners fall back
tripping over each other and panicking Jim and Maxted
still trying to retain possession of their cart move back
among them A JAPANESE SOLDIER kicks the cart aside Jim
makes a grab for the cart but Maxted pulls him away

tennis racquets umbrellas boxes baskets bundles The
smaller children are being carried by their parents

newly arrived convoy flank the column of prisoners on

major and gives the signal superfluously to march With
the SOUNDS of hundreds of clogs clattering into a shuffle
the ragged cavalcade sets off

hesitates for a moment and then continues to stumble on

vehicles Some of the prisoners have dropped out to rest
on the hoods and running boards One of them is Mrs

moving among the corpses removing small articles He holds
Jims shoes in his hands Jim walks over to him Jim
points to the shoes
