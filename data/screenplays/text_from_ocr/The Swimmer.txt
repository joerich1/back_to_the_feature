The war has begun Our country is being invaded
They have taken the first swimming pool

It is a radiantly beautiful Sunday afternoon A man is walking
through a woods barefoot and in bathing trunks His step is
jaunty and he is whistling Dapples of yellow sunlight slant
through the leafy boughs overhead onto his tanned lean-muscled
body The mans name is Ned Merrill He is in his mid-forties
Although his handsome even-featured face shows the marks of his
age more than his body does it is at the moment a youthful face
boyishly exultant with a feeling of well-being Now and then Ned
leaps gracefully from rock to rock in his path -- with the
coordination of a lifelong athlete Everything about him -- his
health his physical beauty his happiness -- seems to be a
celebration of life on this lovely day

The Westerhazys

Suddenly he bursts out of the woods onto a perfect suburban scene
the garden swimming pool and glistening white ridge-top house
of Helen and Don Westerhazy They are sitting on their colorful
terrace Helens eyes are closed Her body is inert Don is
sipping a drink Both wear bathing suits

When Ned sees them he lets out a whoop of greeting and breaks
into a dog trot across the lawn

At the sound of the shout Don and Helen lift their heads to squint
at the approaching figure As Ned comes closer Don stands up and
shades his eyes

Ned has reached the edge of the garden He runs past a female nude
in marble pauses for an instant to slap it sharply and sassily on
the buttocks laughs with pleasure at his action and continues
toward the pool By this time Don and Helen have recognized him
and are waving

Ned reaches the edge of the pool and without breaking his stride
he leaps and arches into the high flat trajectory of a racing
dive

He swims with a perfect crawl and a powerful kick The blue water
breaks up into the diamond-shine of splashes and bubbles as he
cuts through it to the end of the pool He kicks away with a well-
executed racing turn and swims another length He does this again
and again with untiring vigor and stops only when he sees Don
sitting on the diving board offering him a martini Ned bursts
from the water grinning and reaches for the glass

NED
Hey Thanks

He treads water holds the glass up in a silent toast and drinks
the icy-cold delicious gin

DON
So its not because our service is
bad
NED
(laughs)

What do you mean

DON
We havent seen you for so damn
long--
NED
(grins)
Oh well -- you know how it is
DON

Whereve you been keeping yourself

NED
Oh -- here and there here and there
-- what a day Ever see such a
glorious day

He finishes the drink hands the glass to Don and heaves himself
easily and gracefully over the side of the pool They cross to the
terrace

DON
God its wonderful to see you You
look great

NED
(enthusiastic)
So do you--
(Don gives him
a sour look)
Well a little pale around the
edges--

DON
I drank too much last night

They have reached Helen stretched out on the chaise

HELEN
(happily)
Neddy

NED
(rests his hand
on her feet)
How beautiful are thy feet in
sandals O Princes daughter

They burst into laughter She holds out her arms He bends down to
kiss her suddenly she drops her head back on the chaise and
groans

NED
(smiling at her)
Bet you drank too much last night

Don has eased himself gingerly into a chair He looks at Neds
dripping glowing face

DON
Isnt he a sight for sore eyes

HELEN
Oh Neddy weve missed you

DON
Come on now sit down and tell us
everything

HELEN

Wherere you coming from

NED
Oh I was around -- thought Id come
over and have a swim with you
(he gestures)
Look at that water Look at that sun

DON
(squints and grimaces
then gives up and closes

his eyes)
Know what I think I think everybody
drank too much last night

HELEN
It was that rum I drank too much of
that rum

NED
Whose party

HELEN
Our own Dont worry You didnt
miss a thing

DON
Usual Saturday night blowout

HELEN
Same old jokes same old faces
Weve all known each other so long
theres not even anyone to flirt
with

NED
(teasing)
Id have flirted with you

HELEN
(affectionately)
Youre practically a new face

DON
Howre things Ned Have a good
summer

NED
(exuberant)
Oh sure Just great
(he bends over
Helen again)
Come on love how about a swim

HELEN
(weakly)
Uh-uh

NED
(takes her by

the hands)
Come on puts oxygen in your blood
Good for a hangover

HELEN

(groans)

What in the world makes you think
Im hung over

NED
(tugs at her hands)
Ill race you

HELEN
(pleads)
Neddy Please No

He releases her She settles back and closes her eyes

NED
How about it Don

DON
Are you kidding

HELEN
(with a vague wave
towards the bar tray)

Relax Neddy -- have a drink
(she opens her eyes)
Go on -- sit down and tell us what

youve been up to

At this moment the screen door slams and a man comes out of the
house It is Stu Forsburgh He is Neds age but unlike Ned shows
it He is overweight with a paunch and thinning hair He is
dressed in trousers shirt and tie and a sports jacket

NED
(astonished and delighted)
Stu Forsburgh

Stu is equally delighted They clasp each other warmly

STU
How are you Sport

NED
Okay Never better

STU
Im so glad to see you you old
monster

NED
What the hell are you doing here

Cape for three weeks -- hows

NED

good look)

NED
Hey whered you get this

Whyve you got all those clothes on

STU

plane Peggys packing

NED
(appalled)
On a day like this -- youre going
to take a plane Dont give me that

STU
Got to get back to the shop--

NED
(grabs his lapel)
Do you know how long its been
since we had a swim together

STU
Dont remind me--

DON
(at the drink bay)
Whatll you have Stu

NED
(to Don and Helen)

same camp when we were kids

STU
(to Don)
Gee I dont know I drank too much
last night
DON

(lifts the pitcher)
A diluted martini

STU
Okay
(to Ned)
Boy Im out of practice for the
kind of party you throw around here
We dont go in for that in Columbus
unless its New Years Eve--

NED
I told you not to accept that
transfer

STU

What else could I do

NED
(indignantly)
Id have quit before Id let anyone
send me to the provinces

STU
Well -- its healthy

Stus wife Peggy leans out of an upstairs window and calls
PEGGY
Stu Did you pack the pill case

NED
(hoots at Stu)
Healthy

STU
(calls to Peggy)
The vitamin case is on the night
table honey

PEGGY
(with a big smile)
Dont tell me thats Ned Merrill

NED
(waves)
How are you honeybunch Come on

PEGGY

Half a minute
She disappears from the window

NED
God Stu I didnt realize how much
I missed that ugly old mug of yours
Listen get out of those clothes --
well have one quick swim

STU
Not up to it Beginning to feel my
age--

NED

You crazy Youre a year younger
than I am

STU
Yeah You were always pulling
seniority on me at camp--

NED
Remember how we used to take off our
suits and swim for miles up that
river We just never got tired--

STU
Thirteen fourteen fifteen -- we
had nice new pink lungs in those days

NED

The water up there remember That
transparent light green water It
-- it felt different

(the memory of it

shows in his eyes)
What a beautiful feeling We could
have swum around the world in those
days

STU
That was before we ever touched a
drink or a cigarette

DON
Or a girl

HELEN
(rouses herself)
That doesnt sap a mans strength

NED
Or Id be in a wheel chair today

Peggy has come out of the house She is lithe and attractive and
only slightly tense under her badinage

PEGGY
Ned Merrill -- still bragging

Ned crosses to her and hugs her

PEGGY
Oh Ive heard those old schoolboy
stories You all made them up

NED
Figured that out have you
(he hugs her again)
Now lets settle this nonsense about
your taking a plane

PEGGY
(indicates Stu)
Settle it with him I like it here
More and more

NED
Lucinda will be disappointed as
hell--

PEGGY
Well I dont think thats exactly
true

NED

(to Stu)

I can run you over to the house in
ten minutes-—

There is a small uncomfortable pause Don gives Helen a slightly
worried look

NED
(urges)
Come for a minute -- just to say
hello--
(to Don)

Okay if I borrow your car

DON
(confused)
Well sure but--

He looks at Helen

HELEN
(quickly to Ned)
Honestly they havent time We
promised to stop at the Grahams for
a quick goodbye drink You come
with us

PEGGY
(her eyes still on Ned)
Of course hell come with us

HELEN
(to Ned)
You havent seen their new pool
have you
NED
Whose pool

HELEN
The Grahams
NED
(puzzled)

Did the Grahams put in a pool

He crosses to the balustrade along the outer edge of the pool
terrace and looks down From this hilltop can be seen the lush
green valley below crisscrossed by roads dotted here and there
with houses a church spire

DON
(laughs)
Uh huh They nurse it like a baby

NED
(peers over the valley
as if trying to find the
Grahams house and pool)
When did the Grahams put in a pool

DON
Last June

NED
(still puzzled)
Last June

HELEN
(to Peggy)
Did you get the suits off the line

PEGGY
My God I forgot all about them

Ned stares over the valley A faraway look has come into his eyes

HELEN
If theyre still damp I have some
plastic bags you can use

STU
(to Peggy)
Better get them honey and finish
packing
PEGGY
(her eyes on Ned)
Oh theres time--

She crosses to get a drink

NED
(suddenly)
Listen the Biswangers have a pool
havent they

DON
Biswangers

HELEN
You know those awful people on Red
Coat Road Theyre always talking
about their Caribbean cruises or
their electric toothbrushes--
(to Ned)
Sure they have a big pool

NED
(almost to himself)
I could do it

He frowns with concentration He is thinking hard and hears none
of the following small talk

STU

(to Peggy)
Go on honey finish packing

PEGGY
(her eyes on Ned)
I will in a minute

STU
If we miss that plane--

PEGGY
(irritated)
Columbus isnt going to fly away

STU
I want to put the suitcases in the
car
DON
Dont worry Ill get you to the
airport--

Suddenly Ned lets out a whoop of triumph

NED
I could do it I could really do it

HELEN
Do what Neddy

NED

Now with the Grahams theres a
string of pools that curves clear
across the county to our house
Listen--

(he counts carefully

on his fingers)
The Grahams the Lears the Bunkers
Then a portage through the Pasterns
riding ring to the Lindleys and the
Hallorans and over the ridge to the
Gilmartins and Eric Hammars Then
up Alewives Lane to the Biswangers

then uh wait a minute -- whos
next -- I cant think--

(he looks at them

panicky)
I had it a minute ago I-- who is

(his panic increases)
Who is it Whos next to the
Biswangers

HELEN
(gently)
Shirley Abbott

NED
(with great relief)
Shirley Abbott Then cross Route 424
to the Recreation Center Pool then
the Clydes and thats it

DON
Who are the Clydes

NED

That little ranch house at the
bottom of our hill

(stricken)
What if they dont have a pool

(he looks at the

others with alarm)
Everyone has a pool these days
dont they God if they dont have
a pool thatll just ruin it

HELEN
Ruin what
NED
(excited)

Dont you see Ive just figured it
out Look--

(he gestures over

the balustrade)
If I take a sort of dog-leg to the
southwest I can swim home

STU
(laughs)

Ah come on Ned

Helen and Don exchange the briefest of glances

HELEN
Well but -- why would you want to
swim home

DON

I dont get it

NED
Pool by pool They make a river all
the way to our house

HELEN
Well I suppose you could put it
that way--
(firmly)
Now Neddy why dont you sit down
and have a drink and then well all
go to the Grahams--

NED
(hasnt heard a word)
Ill name it the Lucinda River after
my wife

PEGGY
(an edge to her voice)
Thats quite a tribute

NED
(up excited
carried away)
This is the day Ned Merrill swims
across the county

He dashes to the pool and dives in in one long unbroken movement
The others watch him

STU
(laughs)
Always threw himself into the water
like that God what energy

PEGGY
He keeps himself in shape

STU
Oh come on he always ate like a
horse Never put on an ounce

Silently they watch Ned for a moment Stu and Peggy are smiling
-- each a different sort of smile Helen and Don look anxious Ned

has reached the far end of the pool and hoists himself happily
over the curb

STU
Look at him Wouldnt use the
ladder not Ned

Ned without a backward glance is striding hurriedly away in the
direction opposite to that from which he appeared

DON
(calls)
Hey Ned
(louder)
Hey Ned Where you going

NED
(calls back not
breaking his stride)
Im swimming home

STU
Hey Ned

Ned keeps on going

HELEN
(on her feet now
and worried)
Neddy Come back

to Don)
Whered he get that nutty idea

DON
Hes just joking

HELEN

DON
Sure Well find him waiting for us
down at the Grahams

HELEN
Swim to his house Why would he want
to do that

STU
Listen I know Ned-- always loved to
kid around Hasnt changed a bit

They watch as Ned leaps over the shrubbery way at the other end of
the grounds

STU
Hasnt changed a bit

The Grahams

A blinding silver image A high-pitched feminine shriek Ned is
pressing his lips lightly to Betty Grahams cheek She sees his
face reflected in an aluminum foil sun-tan folder she is holding
under her chin
She tosses the device down and leaps up to throw her arms around
him She is about forty plump and tanned

BETTY
Neddy Neddy Its been such a long
time You look wonderful

NED
So do you fatso

BETTY
Im going on a diet a week from
Thursday Whered you come from

NED
Don and Helens

BETTY
Where are they all Why didnt they
come with you

NED
Theyre driving down

The Grahams house is white clapboard and expensive but not as
expensive as the Westerhazys It is obvious that the Grahams have
gone all-out with the landscaping and the outdoor accouterments
The velvet lawn is pierced by a flagpole flying the American flag
There is a good sized terrace and an elaborate brick barbecue The
pool is new and prominent beside it is a wooden bulletin board on
which the Grahams have posted rules for its use

Betty takes Neds hand and leads him to the edge of the pool She
watches his expression carefully as he looks at it

NED
Terrific Absolutely terrific

BETTY
Cost a bundle but Howards had a
marvelous year
(she points)
Look at how clear the water is

NED
Wow

BETTY
(proudly)
Weve got the best filter money can
buy A Dia-something-or-other filter
It filters 99 point 99 point 99 per
cent of all solid matter out of

the water

NED
Gee

BETTY

(crosses to the

little outdoor bar)
We put in a six-inch lint filter
too The way we take care of that
pool the water is purer than
drinking water Whatll you have
Neddy

NED
(indicates the pool)
Scoop me up a glass of that

BETTY
Dont be silly Gin and tonic

NED
Nothing thanks Ill have a swim
and be on my way

BETTY
Oh Neddy you will not You just

NED
Okay -- a light one

BETTY
(mixes the drinks)
Next summer were going to build a
pool-house over there -- you know
with dressing rooms anda little
playroom with a bar

NED
Boy Thatll be some great lay-out

BETTY
(hands him his drink)
Neddy sit down for goodness sake
They sip their drinks

BETTY
(gazes around
triumphantly)
You never thought hed make it did

NED
Who
BETTY

When we were kids and I first
started going out with Howard you
werent very nice to him

NED
I wasnt Why

BETTY
Remember he kept track of every
penny he spent in a little note
book You thought that was very
amusing

NED
I was just jealous

BETTY
Of Howard

NED
I was crazy about you

BETTY
(terribly pleased)
You never said -- I didnt know
that Oh go on You were having a
big affair with Lucinda

NED
Why do you think I got smashed at
your wedding

BETTY
Because Lucinda was dancing with
Buzzy Bunker thats why
NED
(laughs)
What a long memory youve got
Grandma

He senses that Betty is hurt because hes put her on and looks for
a way to make amends

NED
No kidding though youve got a
gorgeous pool

BETTY

(snaps at him)
Ive got everything Ive ever
wanted

(pause she looks

at him her face

wretched)
Funny the way things turn out
isnt it

The sound of a motor has been getting louder and now from around
the house comes Howard sitting on a midget tractor-mower He is
an ordinary-looking man with little humor literal-minded At the
moment he is having the time of his life He drives the tractor
toward the terrace Ned and Betty cross to him

HOWARD
(friendly but
not ecstatic)
Well of all people How are you
Ned

They shake hands Howard pats the tractor

HOWARD
How dtyou like my new toy

BETTY
(proudly)
Next year were going to get the
luxury optionals Padded seat and a
canopy

NED
(frowns at
the tractor)
Sounds as if the timing is a bit off
HOWARD
(somewhat deflated)
Timing

NED
Let me take a look

Howard gets off the tractor Ned lifts the small hood and turns
and twists something which guns up the motor loud and fast

HOWARD
(irritated)
Its not supposed to be a racing
car Whats he doing

BETTY
(giving her husband a
contemptuous glare)
Hes fixing it

NED
Itll be okay now

He puts down the hood The three of them cross to the pool

BETTY
Neds just crazy about our pool

HOWARD
(smugly)
I didnt skimp on anything Ive got
a Dia-Tomaceous Earth Filter in there

NED
Thats what Betty said--

HOWARD
It filters 99 point 99 per cent of
all solid matter out of the water

NED
Betty told me--

HOWARD
(mixing himself a drink)
How come you never put in a pool at
your place
NED
(shrugs)
Never got around to it

HOWARD
Too bad Helps the resale value

NED
I dont have to worry about resale
value

HOWARD

Well with the tennis court and all
that planting you put in youll get
a hell of a lot more than you paid
for it

NED
If I ever sell it

HOWARD
Right person has to come along

NED
I want the girls to be married in
that house--

HOWARD

But-- I thought--
He stops abruptly frowns at Betty

NED
Wont be long now Boys all over the
place Our drive looked like a
parking lot today

Howards eyes meet Bettys She raises her eyebrows There is an
awkward pause although Ned is unaware of it

BETTY
(to change the subject)
Gosh it sure is a heavenly day

HOWARD
(gestures)
Dont like the look of that cloud

The three of them stare up at the blue sky where a strand of
cumulus cloud has appeared in the west

NED
(exclaims)
Its beautiful Its like a dream
city As if were looking at it
from the bow of a ship -- Lisbon
Naples Istanbul --

HOWARD
Hackensack

He laughs at his joke Betty gives him an irritated glance

NED
(dreamily)
Id like to see all those glistening
white domes and minarets against the
sky First chance I get away from
the office thats what Id do Go
sailing around the Golden Horn

BETTY
(pouting at Howard)
Why dont we travel more

HOWARD
What for Weve got everything we
need right here at home--

He is interrupted by the sound of a car horn from the direction of
the driveway Betty leaps up relieved So does Howard

BETTY
That must be Don and Helen with the
Forsburghs

She runs toward the driveway Howard jogs after her Immediately
Ned dives into the pool leaving a glistening trail of bubbles as
the wake of his passage

4
The Lears

Ned is walking rapidly across a spacious lawn toward a large and
elaborate pool and pool-house set at its far end
As he approaches the pool he sees a young girl leaping on the
diving board Her name is Muffie She waves enthusiastically at
Ned Another girl is swimming in the pool She doesnt notice Ned
until she hears his voice

MUFFIE
Hi Mr Merrill how are you

NED
Hi there Muffie

MUFFIE
Mother and Daddy are at the Club

NED
Mind if I have a swim

MUFFIE
Of course not Help yourself

As Ned walks to the end of the pool the other girl swims to meet
him Her hands grasp the curb Ned bends down and pulls her out
and onto the terrace Her name is Julie and she is arrestingly
beautiful Her long blonde hair is plastered to her head Her
eyelashes are stuck together in little points Her perfect
willowy figure is shown off by a brief bikini Water is running
in rivulets down her face and body

NED
It isnt -- Julianne Hooper
JULIE
(delighted)
Yes it is
NED

(stares at her)
I cant believe it Youre all
grown up

There is another flashing smile from Julie

NED
How come we never see you any more

JULIE
I guess you dont need me any more--

NED
Of course we need you Julie --
were always looking for a baby-
sitter--

JULIE
(laughs reproachfully)
Oh Mr Merrill

She picks up a towel and starts to dry her hair Ned watches every
move she makes with intense pleasure

NED
Hey How about next Sunday night
You busy

JULIE
No but--

NED
Okay youre hired Still live in
the same place

JULIE
Yes but--

NED
Ill pick you up at seven

JULIE
Youre putting me on A baby-sitter
Ellen and Aggie would have a fit if
they heard you

She laughs with embarrassment
At this point there is a shout from Muffie

MUFFIE
At last Im parched

A tall boy about seventeen in bathing trunks is coming from the
direction of the drive carrying a carton of Cokes He comes up to
them Ned looks at him blankly

JULIE
Mr Merrill this is my brother
Vernon

Muffie has come out of the pool She takes the carton from him and
puts it on the table

NED
Your brother

They shake hands

NED
(gesturing the height
of a small boy)
But your brother was--

VERNON
(with a grin)
Boy I sure liked that little red
Jaguar you used to have

He crosses to Muffie who is taking cold bottles of Coke out of
the carton

NED
Julie I cant get over you How old
are you now

JULIE
Twenty last month

NED
Going to school

JULIE
(shakes her head)

He and Julie join the other two Vernon hands them each an opened
bottle

MUFFIE
(to Ned)
Gee I miss Ellen and Aggie Where

MUFFIE
(amazed)

They are But when did they-- why

JULIE

NED
(rises suddenly and
puts the Coke down)
Well Ive got to be on my way Im
swimming home

MUFFIE
(laughs)
Youre swimming home

NED
Figured out theres a river of pools
all the way to my house

VERNON
Thats more hiking than swimming

NED
Not hiking exactly Portaging

MUFFIE
Its okay if you like exercise

VERNON
(to Ned with a laugh)
What a crazy idea

JULIE
(with a withering
glance at Vernon)
I think its a brilliant idea

NED
(his excitement
returning)
From here I go to the Bunkers
then a portage through the Pasterns
riding ring then the Hallorans and
so on -- Ive got it all mapped out
in my mind

MUFFIE
What are you doing it for

Ned looks puzzled

MUFFIE
Why do you want to do it

JULIE
(quickly)
I think its very original As if
hes an explorer or something

NED
(approvingly)
Now you sound like a girl with
imagination

JULIE
I mean I think its an adventure

NED
Come with me

JULIE
(taken aback)
Well gee I-- I--

NED
Come on live a little

JULIE
(hesitates)
Well I dont know if--

NED
Come on Well explore the torrential
headwaters of the Lucinda River

Muffie and Vernon giggle at this
JULIE

(with a cold
glance at them)
All right -- I will

She puts down her Coke and jumps up smiling at Ned He is
overjoyed

NED
Race you

They take running dives into the pool and race to the other end
Ned wins They hoist themselves over the curb laughing and
dripping Julies sandals are there She slips her feet into them
and they start off running over the rest of the lawn and down a
slope

5
The Country Lane

Ned and Julie are walking along a narrow country lane half
overgrown with weeds and bushes shaded by tall trees A few
black-eyed Susans are blooming along the side of the road Ned
stops

NED
Funny--

JULIE
What

NED

Black-eyed Susans now

JULIE
Theyre all over the place

NED
Usually bloom later--

He picks a half dozen and hands them to Julie like a country boy
to his girl She smiles with pleasure They walk a little farther
in silence Neds eyes are on Julie constantly admiring her She
catches him looking at her He smiles

JULIE
Mr Merrill--

NED
Hmm
JULIE
What did you mean before -- all that
about my coming over to baby-sit

NED
(puzzled)
Coming over to baby-sit
(remembers)
Oh I was just joking
(smiles)
I was teasing you

JULIE
Gee I wondered

NED
You used to be such a shy little kid
Always brought along a pile of school
books always dropping pencils and
things Never had a word to say

JULIE
I thought plenty though

NED
Thought what

JULIE
Oh -- daydreamed --

NED
What about

JULIE
(gives hima
sidelong glance)
Oh -- lots of things

NED
What sort of things

JULIE
Its so silly I mean it was such
kid stuff

NED
Come on -- tell me
JULIE
(shyly)
I bet you never knew I had a big
crush on you

NED
You did

JULIE
Oh I was mad about you Out of my
head

NED
(terribly pleased)
You were

JULIE
If Mrs Merrill called me to baby-
sit -- even at the last minute --

Id cancel out whoever Id promised
and come to your house instead

NED
(laughs)
You must have lost a lot of
customers

JULIE
And then Id spend about an hour
getting myself fixed up My mother
thought I was nuts I mean I was
just a kid to you but you were a --
god to me

NED
(enormously pleased)
Now youre putting me on

JULIE
Know what Id do after the girls
were asleep Id go up to your room
and open your closet and touch your
suits Then Id go into your
bathroom and smell your shaving
lotion Then one time -- oh this is
a terrible thing to admit--

NED
Tell me--
JULIE
I stole one of your shirts

She looks at him He laughs happily

JULIE
When I was doing my homework up in
my room Id put it on It made me
feel as if you were around me

NED
(his spirits soaring)
Julie -- I -- I didnt know --
JULIE

When youd drive me home late at
night Id pretend like mad--

NED
Pretend what
(Julie doesnt answer)

What is it you used to pretend

JULIE
(embarrassed)
I-- after all I was just a child in
those days--
NED

I want to know--

He takes her hand Julie starts out reluctantly but gets caught up
in her own recital

JULIE
Oh -- that you were desperately in
love with me -- but you were too
honorable to say so because well I
mean -- you were married

She looks at him He is listening seriously Reassured she goes
on

JULIE
So I had to go to Paris to you know
put an ocean between us And no
matter how many divine Frenchmen
begged me Id never marry Id just
live there all pale and mysterious
with huge tragic eyes Then one night
Id be in some club in a fabulous
Paris gown and Id see you at the
door -- tall distinguished a

little gray at the temples--

Ned touches his temples where his hair is indeed turning gray

JULIE

(nods solemnly)
--I pretended your eyes would burn
into me across this whole roomful of
people and suddenly thered be a
hush and everyone would look at me
And then Id just stand up and float
towards you--

She stops abruptly

NED
And then what

JULIE
(disengages her hand)
Thats all
NED

(with a wild surge
of happiness)
I -- I dont know what to say

JULIE
(laughs)
I told you I was a real spooky kid

During the last few exchanges they have been hearing the sound of
voices and laughter from the pool nearby The voices have gradually
grown louder

NED
The Bunkers must be having a party

6
The Bunkers

The Bunkers terrace is crowded with people all of them
prosperous looking chic and deeply tanned White-coated waiters
are passing trays of drinks There is a crowd around Ned and
Julie the women are kissing Ned the men are shaking his hand
Ned is on the crest of the wave His life seems to him as sunny
and full of promise as this summer afternoon

Buzz Bunker a middle-aged man in trunks is sprawled limply
across a wild-looking inflated rubber animal which is floating in
the Bunkers pool His eyes are closed His slack face indicates
that he is loaded When he hears the commotion and cries of
Neddy Neddy he opens one eye and gazes toward the terrace

A woman screams joyfully and breaks through the circle around Ned
She is Enid Bunker a little under forty sleek and handsome

ENID
Look whos here What a marvelous
surprise

She flings her arms around Ned and kisses him When she releases
him she looks appraisingly at Julie in her still damp bikini

NED
This is Julianne Hooper our baby-
sitter I lost her for a while but I
found her again

ENID
(with a slight
curl of the lip)
How fortunate for you darling

NED
(oblivious)
My God that sun tan You look
ravishing

Enid all smiles again gives him a playful push

ENID
You know where the bar is -- go get
a drink

She rushes off to another approaching guest For an instant Ned
surveys the scene Then he says with glowing tenderness

NED
How bonny are the banks of the
Lucinda River
JULIE

What

NED
I knew wed find friends all along
the way--

(leads her toward

the bar)

Lets have a quick one to appease
he natives--

ct

As they push through the crowd Ned continues to be greeted
enthusiastically Everyone is friendly and warm and terribly
pleased to see him They eye Julie with various expressions most
of the men admiring her the women amused or jealous All of these
encounters are en passant

ONE MAN
(claps Ned on
the shoulder)
Hey Ned Good to see you Howve you
been

NED
Great Just great

A WOMAN
(exclaims)

(and kisses him)

NED

4TH WOMAN

FRECKLED BLONDE

The fourth woman pokes her -- but too late

NED

When he has gone the freckled blonde whispers to her friend
One of the men shakes Neds hand

MAN
Good Lord Whered you pop up from

NED
How you doing chum

MAN

(staring at Julie)
Not as well as you

Ned laughs and pulls Julie on At the bar the Bunkers Negro
butler extends the same hearty welcome

THE BUTLER

NED
Hiya Stanley Hows Inez

THE BUTLER
Will she be glad to see you sir

NED
Inez is my girl

THE BUTLER
(beams )
Yes sir

NED
(indicates a wine bottle
in a silver cooler)
Champagne

THE BUTLER
Yes sir

He takes the bottle out of the cooler Ned examines the label

NED
Dom Perignon Thats for us

The butler gets out two champagne glasses and fills them

NED
(to Julie)
Like champagne

JULIE
Ive only had it once -- ata
birthday party --

The butler hands them their glasses

JULIE
(boasting)
A boy drank it out of my slipper

NED
(as he touches
his glass to hers)
Heres to sugar on our strawberries

Julie giggles Ned drains his glass and hardly allowing Julie to
finish pulls her along toward the pool A man stops them and
shakes Neds hand with vigor

MAN
Ned My God

NED
(turns)
Brian How are you Brian

BRIAN
Listen I feel rotten for not
calling you Been so damn busy --
dont know where the time goes --

NED
Lets have lunch this week -- for
sure

BRIAN

Okay but I want to tell you right
now I think it was a stinking thing
to do -- what they pulled on you
over at your place--

Neds eyes are a little anxious a little puzzled

NED
Whats that Brian

BRIAN
I dont care how big a firecracker
that new guy was Brother that story
really jolted me--

Neds eyes flicker past Brian He is not listening
BRIAN
I kept thinking what if some young
smart-ass comes in to our shop and
does that to me

Neds attention is elsewhere

NED
Ill hear from you huh

He is already pushing past Brian

NED
Call me up at the office--

Neds eyes are on an extremely good-looking woman of about thirty
who is wearing a backless bathing suit she is talking to a man

Ned sneaks up behind the woman and enfolds her in a bear hug

NED
Beautiful Cynthia
Cynthia spins around delighted

CYNTHIA
Neddy darling

NED
Wheres Carter

CYNTHIA
(happily)

Havent you heard Were separated

Julie has joined them

NED
This is Julianne Hooper our baby-
sitter

CYNTHIA

(her eyes on Ned)
Run along to your babies dear

NED
Shes with me Were swimming across
the county

CYNTHIA

(gives Julie
an icy stare)
How healthy and young of you

NED
(admiring Cynthia)
Who the hell else out here could
wear a suit like that

CYNTHIA
Why dont you come over tonight --
for dinner

And she means more than dinner

NED
Love to -- if Lucinda hasnt made a
date

CYNTHIA
(furious)
Lucinda Well -- congratulations

She turns her back abruptly

Ned hasnt heard He has already pushed past her intent on
getting to the pool A man rushes determinedly over to him and
blocks his way

DAN
Why dont you leave some phone
numbers around Been trying to reach
you

NED
Danny-boy How are you chum

DAN
Look Ive heard of an opening --
sounded perfect for you your
experience Smaller place than
youre used to but these two guys
are creative as hell and--

NED
(puts his arm
around Julie)
Say hello to Julianne--

DAN

(briefly)
Hello Julianne--

(his attention

turns immediately

back to Ned)
This firm has a reputation for
quality I think if you approach
them right take a cut just at
first--

NED
(puzzled)
A cut

DAN
Now look here Ned -- you dont have

to pretend with me

But Ned has Julie by the hand and is running to the pool She
slips out of her sandals and Ned tosses them clear across the
length of the pool to the grass at the other end They dive in

Buzz is still floating on the rubber raft He doesnt move nor
glance her way as Julie passes him Ned stops alongside of the
raft treading water

NED
(loudly)
Buzz Hey Buzz

Buzz turns his head slowly and stares at him with glazed eyes

NED
Know what day this is Buzz

Buzz looks infinitely bored

NED
This is the day Ned Merrill swims
across the county

Expressionless Buzz turns his head away and closes his eyes

NED
(shouts joyfully to
Buzz and the world)
This is the day

The Pasterns Riding Ring

A standard size grassy riding ring neatly enclosed by a low white
fence In the background is a well-cared-for stable Inside the
ring the jumps are set up for practice Ned is hurdling one of the
highest with graceful ease After he lands he turns to Julie who
is watching him

NED
(triumphant)
How about that

JULIE
Fabulous

NED
Im in good shape huh
JULIE
(enthusiastic)
Oh yes Youre in much better shape
than my father for example

Ned reacts to this comparison He gives her a look

NED
Come on try it

Julie runs to him He motions her down on one knee fingertips to
the ground and takes the same position himself

NED
All set Go

They dash together toward the next jump and hurdle it in unison
Julie sails over her hair flowing out behind her They land
together laughing delightedly Ned reaches for her hand and
together they continue to circle the ring leaping over the jumps
like two healthy and beautiful animals For Ned it is a period of
his youth returned and his face is boyish with sheer
uncomplicated joy in the perfect obedience of his body in the
girl beside him in the sunny day

Suddenly as he lands Ned makes a stunned grimace of pain He
gasps and holds his ankle

JULIE
Whats the matter

NED
Twisted it--

JULIE
Oh Does it hurt much

NED
No its nothing -- lets sit down
for a minute--

Ned limps in real pain toward a place near the fence where the
tree branches make a dappled patch of shade Julie sits Ned lies
on his stomach his chin propped on his hands his eyes enjoying
her

NED
What kind of a job do you have
Julie

Lots of nuts around

JULIE

(nods eagerly)
Once my boss sent me to deliver some
record books I got into an empty
elevator and pressed twenty-six
Then a man got in and pressed
twenty-seven Then the door closed
and the elevator started up This
man came right over and kissed me
On the mouth

NED
(alarmed)
Whatd you do

JULIE
I dropped the record books

NED
Whatd he do

JULIE
He picked them up

NED
Then what

JULIE
He gave them to me and the door
opened on the twenty-sixth floor
and I got out
(expels a breath)
Can you imagine In a building on
Park Avenue

Julie sighs at the quixotic behavior of the human male She
stretches out in the grass Ned puts his hand lightly on her
ankle
NED
(softly)
How beautiful are thy feet in
sandals O Princes daughter--

He touches her leg

JULIE
(moves her leg away)
Thats from the Bible isnt it

NED
Song of Solomon

JULIE
When I was a little girl in Sunday
School they never mentioned that
part of the Bible

NED

(soberly)
You still are a little girl in
Sunday School Ive been thinking I
could meet you on the train in the
morning and take you to your office
when you have to go out on an errand
you could call me and Ill go with
you and Ill pick you up at noon
every day and well have lunch
together--

(his enthusiasm grows)
Thats what well do Ill take
care of you Julie

JULIE
(inches away a little)
Gee I dont think that would work
out very well Mr Merrill I mean
I--I need my lunch hour to get my
hair done -- and shop -- things like
that

Ned hasnt really listened to her He very tentatively and lightly
strokes her hair

NED
That shirt of mine Julie Do you
still have it
JULIE
(shakes her head)
After a while I decided it was --
well it was just a shirt -- and I
threw it away--

Ned looks hurt

JULIE
You had so many shirts I didnt
think youd miss it or anything Do
you mind

NED
No but I wish youd told me how you
felt

JULIE

Oh I couldnt I wouldve died

NED
(soberly)
Theres so little love in the world
If its kept a secret then its
wasted dont you see

He lets a long strand of her hair slip through his fingers She
moves away the least bit

NED
I wont let you ever be scared or
hurt

He runs his finger along her arm

NED
And if you want anything -- whatever
it is -- you just come to me

He puts his arm across her breast and around her protectively

NED
Ill -- Ill be your guardian angel--

The hug is meant to be the most delicate and tender embrace but
Julie misinterprets it and tries to release herself She makes
only a slight move but Neds grip tightens
NED
(softly)
Julie -- Julie -- Julie--

Julie panics and breaks away from him She jumps to her feet and
dashes off through the high grass

NED
(leaps up)
Julie

She doesnt look back She is running away Devastated Ned
watches her until she is out of sight

The Lindleys
Two suburban matrons in their late thirties good-looking well-
dressed in the ubiquitous suburban uniform of madras shorts and
round collared blouses are seated under a tree in a small woods
The woods border a large clearing of mowed lawn at the end of
which is a swimming pool and an elaborate Tudor house

The two women whose names are Harriet and Jane have bird-watcher
manuals and notebooks in their laps They scan the branches of
nearby trees through binoculars

HARRIET
Its a Chestnut Sided Warbler See
there It has a yellow cap

JANE
No no its a Myrtle Warbler Just
the crown is yellow and it has a
yellow rump--

She lowers her binoculars to rifle through the pages of the manual

Harriet continues to look through her binoculars Suddenly she
gasps swings them in another direction and peers intently

JANE
What is it

HARRIET
I dont know--
JANE
Whats it look like

HARRIET
Bronze-crested tawny-chested flat-
bellied with a blue rump--

After a glance at Harriet Jane lifts her own binoculars They
suddenly frame the figure of Ned limping through the woods

JANE
Oh-oh I havent spotted that one in
a long time

HARRIET
Who is he

JANE
Common species Found everywhere
except home in the nest

HARRIET
Oh Whats the female like

JANE
Small brown gray crest

Ned has come out of the woods and is crossing the lawn toward the
house The two women follow him with their binoculars

HARRIET
Like birds The gorgeous ones always
mate with the drab ones

JANE
She is not drab And shes very nice

Ned has now arrived at the terrace at the back of the house The
windows are open The place is silent

NED
(shouts)
Eliot Nancy Hey Eliot

There is no answer

NED
Hello Hello Anybody home
The house is deserted Neds look of bright anticipation fades
His shoulders slump His disappointment is obvious He sits down
in a chair all the lines of his body slack

JANE
(sarcastically)
Too bad No reception committee No
drums and banners

HARRIET
Id have stayed home if he was coming

After a moment Ned pulls himself together and his steps dragging
crosses to the pool The family has only recently left it There
are remains of drinks half-filled dishes of peanuts Childrens
toys are scattered around On a chair is a beach bag and a mans
jacket On the grass near the pool a croquet game is set up
mallets and balls lying about Ned surveys the scene with a lack
of enthusiasm He wanders restlessly over to the ice-bucket digs
out some ice and pours himself a short drink He eats a peanut
There is a portable radio on the table He switches it on listens
for a moment to the broadcast of a Sunday baseball game

JANE
(sourly)
Whats the name of that bird A
crow Takes whatever he wants from
the other fellows nest--

Ned switches off the radio puts down the barely tasted drink
rummages in the beach bag and finds a pack of cigarettes He puts
a cigarette in his mouth and looks around for a match There are
none in the bag He looks on the tables near the pool but finds
only an empty packet which he tosses away in frustration

HARRIET
God I know just how he feels

Neds search for a match has become more frantic He picks up the
mans jacket and goes through the pockets without success He
dumps the beach bag upside down and sorts through the pile of
contents

HARRIET
Would I love to give him a light

JANE
I wouldnt give him the time of day
HARRIET
Whats the matter Whyve you got it
in for him

JANE
I happen to have heard the story and
Im on her side

HARRIET
(promptly)
I havent heard the story and Im on
his side

Ned takes the cigarette out of his mouth and tosses it away He
starts for the end of the pool passing the croquet game He
pauses and picks up a mallet then places a ball His first stroke
is perfect -- the ball rolls directly through the wicket His
second stroke is successful but comes to rest in a position from
which it is impossible to make a good third stroke He scowls at
the ball He bends down and moves the wicket to a favorable
position He strokes the ball through it Then obviously feeling
much better he jauntily continues towards the pool

JANE
(triumphantly)
See that Hes got the ethics of a
magpie

HARRIET
Oh come on We all cheat if we think
we can get away with it
(glances at Jane)
Dont you

Janes lips tighten She lowers her binoculars and starts looking
through her bird manual By this time Ned is swimming across the
pool He reaches the far end and leaps over the curb

HARRIET
Bravo Beautiful

She watches Ned favoring his bad ankle stride happily away
Jane is still consulting the bird manual

JANE
By the way you were wrong That
bird we saw before was a Myrtle
Warbler —
Harriet glances at the manual with bored indifference

HARRIET
I dont give a damn if it was a
solid gold warbler

She stretches out lazily on the ground still thinking about Ned
After a moment she turns her head towards Jane and demands

HARRIET
What are we doing here in the prime
of our lives -- watching birds

The Hallorans

Ned limps up to the impressive entrance gate to the Halloran
estate The huge house is set well back from the road As he is
about to start up the drive a limousine turns in after him It is
driven by a dignified Negro Ned signals him to stop He
approaches the car smiling

NED
Hi there Steve

He crosses to the car door

NED
How are you Steve
(frowns)

Oh youre not Steve

THE CHAUFFEUR
(politely)
No How are you Mr Merrill

NED
Im a friend of the Hallorans

THE CHAUFFEUR
Yes I know

NED
Mind if I ride up to the house with
you
THE CHAUFFEUR
Not at all

He is about to get out of the car to open the back door

NED
Dont bother

He opens the front door and gets in beside the chauffeur The

Sunday New York Times is lying on the seat Ned moves it over

car starts off

NED
(with an anxious glance
at the chauffeur)
How long have you been working for
the Hallorans

THE CHAUFFEUR
Going on two years now

NED
What happened to Steve

THE CHAUFFEUR
(pleasantly)
Im afraid I dont know

NED
(chummy)
What a character Did he mangle the
English language

The chauffeur doesnt answer

NED
We told him he ought to be on
television
Again no answer
NED

Big bass voice You should have
heard that guy sing

THE CHAUFFEUR
(evenly)
A natural sense of rhythm

The
THE CHAUFFEUR
(enthusiastically)
You bet

Suddenly something about the Negros question bothers him Ned
glances at him The chauffeur is gazing straight ahead his
profile pleasant and impassive

The car pulls up in front of the entrance to the house Ned opens
the door and gets out

NED
Ill take them the paper

THE CHAUFFEUR
(hands it to him)
Thank you

NED
Thank you for the lift My apologies
-- I dont know why I thought you
were Steve

THE CHAUFFEUR
(casually very
courteous)
Thats okay Sometimes you all look
alike to us too

Ned gives him a look and turns away He limps slightly as he walks
off around the house The Hallorans pool which is several
hundred yards away in back of the house is set at the end of a
wide rolling lawn Everything about the estate says lots of old
money Mr and Mrs Halloran are sitting at a table beside the
pool They are both gray-haired handsome distinguished-looking
elegant in manner and totally naked It becomes apparent at once
that Mrs Halloran is the Commanding General of this couple and
Mr Halloran her lieutenant She has set up what looks like an
outdoor office at the pool On the table is a typewriter piles
of papers pencils envelopes etc and a telephone

At the moment Mrs Halloran is busily stapling tickets to form
letters and stuffing them into envelopes From time to time she
consults a long list of names and addresses in front of her Mr
Halloran is in the midst of a conversation on the phone

MR HALLORAN
(obviously speaking
to a young child)
You want me to say hello to the
teddy bear Hello teddy bear--

MRS HALLORAN
(impatiently)
Tell him to call his mother

MR HALLORAN
(into phone)
Will you call your mummy please
Oh you want me to say hello to your
little brother Hello little--

MRS HALLORAN
(snatches the phone

from Mr Halloran)

Young man I want to speak to your
mother at once

She hands the phone back to Mr Halloran and immediately continues
her stapling

MR HALLORAN
(into phone)
Mrs McCauley this is Chester
Halloran oh yes theyre
adorable --

He sees the sour look on his wifes face and continues quickly
MR HALLORAN

Im calling about the Safari Ball a
benefit for the Preserve Our Wild

Life Foundation Oh of
course out of the question -- bon
voyage --

There is a feeling that Mrs McCauley has hung up before the bon
voyage Mr Halloran hangs up

MR HALLORAN
Shes leaving tomorrow for a cruise
around the world--

MRS HALLORAN
(grimly)
The hell she is

Ned has come around the corner of the house and favoring his
ankle
him

is limping towards the Hallorans

They have not yet noticed

Mr Halloran sighs consults a list of names and is about to dial
again when the phone rings

MR HALLORAN
(into phone)
Hello Oh hello honey--

MRS HALLORAN
(impatiently)
Tell her to hurry -- theyll miss
the sun

MR HALLORAN
(who has been listening
on the phone)
he absolutely refuses to bring the
hildren unless we put on our suits

Qan

MRS HALLORAN
fter the way we brought her up
hats the matter with her

3b

MR HALLORAN

(into phone)
fter the way we brought you up
hats the matter with you honey
(listens then to
Mrs Halloran)
She says theyre her children and
shes going to bring them up her
way

3b

MRS HALLORAN
Theyll end up repressed

MR HALLORAN
(into phone)
Mummy says theyll end up repressed

He listens a second and hangs up

Ned is coming toward them when suddenly he remembers something

MR HALLORAN
(sadly)
Shes not going to bring the children

He
retraces his steps a few feet toward a convenient bush puts the
newspaper down on the ground and removes his trunks

Mrs Halloran is peering toward the now nude figure coming toward
them holding the trunks and the newspaper as a modest cover

MRS HALLORAN
Good heavens Its Ned Merrill

MR HALLORAN
(squinting at Ned)
I wonder if hes come to ask us again

MRS HALLORAN
(firmly)
Hell get the same answer

MR HALLORAN
Oh dear it seems a little mean--

MRS HALLORAN
(shaking her head)
Hes not going to get a penny

MR HALLORAN
(wheedling)
Couldnt we help him out a little
For old times sake After all hes
a friend--

MRS HALLORAN
Friends are not deductible

Ned is closer and waving
MRS HALLORAN
(calls sweetly)
Hello Neddy dear

MR HALLORAN
How are you my boy

Ned reaches them and places the New York Times on the table Mrs
Halloran flips through it hurriedly and selects a section

NED
Im swimming across the county

MRS HALLORAN
(abstracted her
head in the paper)
Why I didnt know one could--

NED
Met your chauffeur on the way in

MR HALLORAN
Nice boy Real sense of personal

worth

NED
Always got a lot of laughs out of
old Steve--

MRS HALLORAN
(still scanning the paper)
Steve had no sense of personal
worth--

Suddenly she folds back a page of the paper excited

MRS HALLORAN
Its in here

MR HALLORAN
What does it say dear

MRS HALLORAN
(reads)
At a meeting of the Zoning Board
local property owners objected to
the Halloran proposal on the basis
that it would overcrowd the public
schools--

MR HALLORAN
(to Ned)
Weve petitioned to have the Driscoll
Estate cut up into two-acre lots
instead of five-acre lots

Ned is staring at a nearby tree its branches bare

MRS HALLORAN
(triumphantly her
eyes on the paper)
Theyre practically calling us
Communists
MR HALLORAN
(airily)
Sticks and stones Sticks and stones
Sticks and stones

Mrs Halloran puts the paper down Her jaw is set

MRS HALLORAN
Its going to be a tough fight
Chester

She takes up her stapling with renewed vigor Ned has not been
listening to the last exchanges His attention bas been totally
focused on the tree

NED
(suddenly)
Why is that tree bare

MR HALLORAN
Thats an ash

NED
That tree must be blighted

MR HALLORAN
No ashes are the last to get leaves
and the first to lose them

Ned continues to eye the tree in puzzlement for a moment

MRS HALLORAN
(to Mr Halloran)
Overcrowding the public schools As
if people with two acres give birth
to more children than people with
five acres

MR HALLORAN
(indignantly)
Thats not even a biological fact

During the foregoing Ned has crossed to the table He picks up
one of the tickets

NED
Safari Ball -- put me down for a
table
MRS HALLORAN
Oh Neddy

NED
Whats wrong Dont I always support
your benefits

MRS HALLORAN
(firmly)
A table costs one thousand dollars

NED
Okay put me down

She hesitates He picks up the pen and holds it out to her She is
about to protest but something in his eyes changes her mind She
writes his name on the list This makes him feel much better His
spirits lift visibly Mr Halloran beams and nods smugly at his
wife

MR HALLORAN
By the way my boy I was awfully
sorry we couldnt be of help

NED
I dont recall asking you for help

MR HALLORAN
Oh dear I thought-- howre Lucinda
and the girls

NED
Lucindas fine and the girls are
home playing tennis Now if you
dont mind I think Ill get wet

He crosses to the pool

MR HALLORAN
(sotto voce)
Well He didnt ask for any money
after all

MRS HALLORAN
Just wait

Ned is swimming across the pool mostly using one arm his trunks
held above the water in the other hand He reaches the end of the
pool hoists himself easily over the curb and puts on his trunks
He turns salutes the Hallorans and hurries off

MR HALLORAN
There you see He must be back on
his feet He bought a whole table
didnt he

With a knowingly skeptical smile Mrs Halloran picks up a pencil
and definitely crosses Neds signature off the list

The Gilmartins

A boy of about eleven dressed in shorts is sitting on a stool
behind the wooden crate counter of a home-made lemonade stand on a
country road He is playing a recorder Nearby is the entrance to
a drive up to a large house It is obvious that few cars come up
this road and probably no pedestrians

The sky has darkened by this time The frail half-naked boy and
the plaintive sound of the recorder convey a sense of aching
loneliness The boy sees Ned approaching He continues to play the
recorder until Ned is at the stand

NED
Hi
THE BOY
(puts the recorder down)
Hi

NED
Your names Gilmartin isnt it

THE BOY

lemonade)

his wet trunks)

NED

NED

The boy looks dubious
NED

The boy doesnt answer He fills the cup and hands it to Ned

hand is shaking as he takes it

girls you can play with

KEVIN
How big

NED
A little bigger than you

KEVIN
Do you play with them

NED
Sure we play catch and tennis We
go bike riding together--

KEVIN
(matter-of-factly)

I have an English racing bike

NED
You bring it over Well race you

He puts down his empty cup

KEVIN
Want another Youll owe me twenty
cents

NED

Havent time Im swimming home
The boy eyes him suspiciously

NED
Mind if I use your pool

KEVIN
Well I dont mind but--

Without waiting to hear what he has to say Ned has already
started up the drive The boy picks up his recorder and follows
him
NED
You know those girls of mine are
like a couple of wild cats When I
get home from the office they pounce
on me They nearly hug the breath
out of me

KEVIN
What games do they play

NED
Cops and robbers touch football--

KEVIN
They play chess

NED
We havent tried that

KEVIN
Chess is a brainy game

As they come close to the pool Ned is stunned to see that it is
drained

NED
(dismayed)
Its empty

He crosses to the edge and stares disconsolately down at the empty
concrete rectangle

NED
God this does it This really does
it

He sits wearily the boy beside him

NED
My whole projects ruined

The boy looks at his forlorn face He senses Neds vulnerability
and for the first time is drawn to him

KEVIN
(unhappily)
They took the water out because Im
not a good swimmer Im bad at
sports At school nobody wants me on
their team

NED
Its a lot better that way -- take
it from me At first you think its
the end of the world because youre
not on the team and then--

KEVIN
(eagerly)
Then what
NED

You realize youre free Youre your
own man You dont have to worry
about getting to be the captain and
all that status-stuff

KEVIN
Theyd never elect me captain ina
million years

NED
Youre the captain of your soul
Thats what counts Know what I
mean

The boy nods gravely They sit in silence for a moment

NED
Theres one thing I could do I
could get down there and make
believe Im swimming across the
pool

KEVIN
Thats kind of cheating isnt it

NED
Not if I did all the strokes exactly
as if I were in the water

KEVIN
(happily)
Thats a good idea

NED
(rises)
Okay lets do it

Delighted the boy follows him to the shallow end of the pool
They jump down to the concrete bottom

NED
All set Lets start off with a
crawl

Walking side by side and stroking as if they are really in the
water they begin

NED
Thats right Relax Reach out Say
youve got very good form

KEVIN
Ive had lots of lessons Its just
that Im afraid of the water

They continue about a third of the way

NED
Okay now change to the side stroke

They do so

NED
Know what we do in the winter We
flood our tennis court and we ice
skate on it Those kids of mine look
so damn cute Like a couple of elves
in those little red caps -- stocking
caps

KEVIN
I dont know how to skate

NED
You come over next winter and Ill
teach you Then well have a hockey
game

KEVIN
(joyfully)
Okay

They have gone another third of the way
NED
Breast stroke

They pantomime the breast stroke

NED
Yes sir My kids think Ive got all
the answers My kids think Im just
about it

They arrive at the end of the pool

KEVIN
(jubilantly)
Ive done it Its the first time
Ive ever swum the whole length

NED
Congratulations

KEVIN
(suddenly crestfallen)
I suppose it doesnt count because
theres no water

NED
For us there was

KEVIN
(looks at him curiously)

Well -- thats a lie isnt it

NED
No You see if you make believe hard
enough that somethings true -- then
it is true -- for you

They climb up the ladder
KEVIN

Lets do it again

NED
Ive got to be going

KEVIN
Oh come on Please

NED
(shakes his head)
Its getting late--

KEVIN
(coldly)
Okay goodbye

NED
Im sorry Id like to but--

Kevin is unforgiving hes been failed again

KEVIN
Okay If youre going to leave then
leave
He turns away
NED

Ill give you a ring tomorrow --
about coming over --

The boy doesnt answer

Ned starts off down the driveway He has gone only a few yards
when he hears the unmistakable sound of someone jumping up and
down on the diving board At first it doesnt register Then he
stops in his tracks a look of intense alarm on his face Ned
turns and dashes back The boy is leaping hard up and down on the
board Ned sprints up on to the board and throws his arms around
the boy from behind The force of this action almost tumbles both
of them into the empty pool They regain their balance The boy
looks at Ned stunned and bewildered

NED
Its okay -- its okay

KEVIN
Whats the matter

NED
I thought you were going to dive--

KEVIN
(amazed)

You thought I was going to dive

Ned releases the boy who turns and stares at him
KEVIN
(as if explaining
to a child)
Theres no water in the pool

Ned gives him a long thoughtful look

NED
Well -- so long again

He walks away turning once to look back at the boy who is
sitting alone on the curb of the empty pool When Ned is part way
down the drive he hears the sound of the recorder playing the same
tune as before

Mrs Hammars

This is a contemporary house surrounded by a lovely garden The
pool is a free-form shape Mrs Hammar an old lady is bending
over to cut some flowers She has a basket on one arm in which she
lays them She is over seventy with snow white hair a majestic
figure She wears pearls and a soft print dress -- very much the
grande dame

She hears a splash in the pool and straightens up surprised She
cannot tell who it is from this distance so she walks slowly
toward the pool By the time she is close Ned is three quarters
of the way toward the opposite end but she recognizes him She
stops rigid with anger As Ned leaps out of the pool she hurries
to confront him

NED
(very warm
and friendly)
Good afternoon Mrs Hammar How are
you

MRS HAMMAR
(coldly)
May I ask what youre doing here

NED
On my way home -- thought Id cool
off in the pool--

MRS HAMMAR
(icily)
Who gave you permission to use the
pool

Ned is completely baffled at her tone and attitude

NED
Im Ned Merrill
(indicates the
basket on her arm)
Flowers are beautiful -- I see
Erics put in a rock garden--

MRS HAMMAR
Youre not welcome here Mr Merrill

NED
(amazed)
You know me dont you Im a friend
of Erics

MRS HAMMAR
Friend How dare you use that word
(her voice breaks)
You never came to see him -- you
never even called him--

There is a flicker in Neds eyes as if he has suddenly remembered
something unpleasant and long buried

NED
How is Eric Is he better

The woman gives him a horrified stare Neds eyes widen with a
sudden realization He backs away slowly then faster

MRS HAMMAR
Just one minute Mr Merrill

Ned stops
MRS HAMMAR
This is my house now Dont you ever
set foot on my property again

Ned draws in a breath turns and runs

MRS HAMMAR
(a frail shout
after him)
Dont you ever come here again

She stands where he has left her her face crumpled with grief

The Biswangers

An extremely noisy and frantic party is going on around the pool
and on a huge terrace covered by a plastic dome (The plastic dome
is used to cover the pool in winter) A loudspeaker is blaring
raucous music

This is the Biswangers party and everything about it is louder
and faster than at the Bunkers -- the clothes are brighter and
further out the women wear more jewels No one at all is ina
bathing suit It is apparent too that the party is being given
to celebrate Henry Biswangers hole-in-one A huge banner is
strung from one side of the dome to the other It reads

CONGRATULATIONS HENRY HOLE-IN-ONE
TWELFTH HOLE MEADOWLARK CLUB

Attached to a float bobbing in the pool is a number 12 flag from
a golf green All the other decorations are in the shape of 12s
The centerpiece of the buffet table is a huge 12 molded out of
ice Embedded in its ice base is an enormous bowl of caviar No
one notices Neds arrival He stands forlornly at the edge of the
party

Henry Biswsanger and two other men are examining the plastic dome
Henry is a bull muscular and in tip-top physical shape a
blustering rough diamond who has made it the hard way and is
perfectly honest about enjoying it He slaps the dome proudly as
he talks

HENRY
--aint it a bitch Did you ever see
anything like it Fifteen tons --
thirty thousand pounds of structured
aluminum and clear plastic
(strokes the dome

affectionately)
And she rolls She rolls on these
tracks here -- slides right back

like a goddam toy
ONE OF THE MEN
Batteries

HENRY
Hell no Machinery to drive this
thing takes up half the space down
there--

He gestures

THE OTHER MAN
What kinda temperature can you keep
it in the winter

HENRY
Like a goddam hothouse Up to 90 if
I want It can be 20 below anda
blizzard outside and I can be in
there bakin

Two other men drinks in hand are standing out of Henrys earshot
looking at the flag bobbing in the pool

MAN
--Club gave it to him You make a
hole in one at Meadowlark -- they

give you the flag

HIS FRIEND
Guess they dont lose many flags
that way

MAN
Maybe they shouldnt of lost this
one

The friend raises his eyebrows

MAN
He was playing alone Just him and
the caddy

They both glance at Henry who is still chatting away about his
pool dome

HENRY
How much use you get outta your
pools Three months Three and a
half if youre lucky With this rig

Im guaranteed the use of my pool
all year around

THE MAN NEXT TO HIM
Sure and swimmings good for the
ticker at our age--

HENRY
So what do you guys do in the
winter I tried them health clubs in
the City Bunch of pansies runnin
around droppin soap Right Right

They all laugh heartily

A blonde and a red-head both with elaborately lacquered hair-dos
appropriate for a formal ball are sitting at a small table
playing gin rummy and drinking martinis

BLONDE
(indicating the pool)
A pools to get wet in Who needs an
olympic-size pool to get wet in

RED-HEAD
Wet
(pats her hair)
After what I pay Pablo every week

BLONDE
Romeo does me All the girls are
going to Romeo now

RED-HEAD
(worried)
Do you think Romeos better than
Pablo
BLONDE

(touching her hair)
Sweetie Look at the difference

A waiter comes with a tray They help themselves to two more
martinis

Henry has a larger audience now

HENRY
Last New Years Eve for instance
Big bash all night Grace and I got

home at dawn loaded -- not too
loaded to get our clothes off--
(laughs)

--so there we are bare-ass and we
jump in the pool and its all
steamy and warm and the snow flakes
are floatin down and the hi-fi
system is playin and I says to
Grace--

He whispers to one of his friends The man throws his head back
with a loud obscene laugh

At the edge of the terrace Ned is tapping a woman on the
shoulder

NED
Hello Grace--

She turns Grace Biswanger is about forty She is dressed in wild-
colored hostess pajamas wears false eyelashes and a huge diamond
ring Her automatically wide smile fades the instant she sees Ned

GRACE
(loudly)
Why this party has everything
Including a gate-crasher

Several nearby guests turn around to stare Ned tries his usual
charm

NED
I thought youd be glad to see me

GRACE
(bellicosely)
You never came when I invited you
Why should I be glad to see you now

NED
I thought better late than--

GRACE
You thought wrong buster

NED
(politely)
As a gatecrasher do I rate a drink
GRACE
Suit yourself

She turns her back on him and walks away Ned crosses to the bar
He is terribly conspicuous and naked among all these overdressed
people Some eye him curiously A few who know him nod coldly or
glance at him with dislike The bartender is mixing some drinks
for a waiter who stands ready with a small tray

NED
(leans on the
bar friendly)
Youre new here arent you

BARTENDER
(rudely)
What dya mean new

NED
Oh just -- that I havent seen you
around at parties

BARTENDER
(with a nasty look
at his nakedness)
I aint seen you either

Ned who has always been instant pals with bartenders is
mystified by this reception

NED
Ill have a gin on the rocks please--

The bartender gives him a sullen look

NED
--when you have a chance

The bartender continues to mix the other drinks Ned is joined at
the bar by a young sexy-looking blonde in a tight sailor suit
Her name is Joan She puts an empty glass down on the bar

JOAN
(to the bartender)

Here I am again Leroy Fill ‘er up

She gives Ned a dazzling smile and leaps on the bar next to him
JOAN

Some big deal huh

(indicates the

pool the dome etc)
Boy you sure got to like swimming to
go in for this kind of expenditure

(eyes his body

with approval)
Youre the type who goes in for
swimming huh

NED
(gravely)
Why not -- when the world is so
generously supplied with water

JOAN
(hasnt quite got it)
Im not a maniac about pools To
tell you the truth its murder on my
hair

NED
Lovely hair

The bartender has put their drinks in front of them They clink
glasses and drink

JOAN
(flirtatiously)

You a neighbor from around here

Ned shakes his head

JOAN
Oh youre a friend of the
Biswangers--—

NED

(shakes his head)
Theyre not even on our Christmas
card list

JOAN
Then what are you

NED
Im an explorer
JOAN
(giggles)
I mean what are you doing here

NED
Im swimming home

JOAN
(giggles again)

You married

NED
Whats that got to do with it

Joan gives him a long sizing-up look

JOAN
You divorced or what

NED
Want to come with me

JOAN
Where

NED
Along a river of sapphire pools

JOAN
Ive never heard anyone talk like
you

NED

Come with me and be my love--

JOAN
Oh-oh Ive heard that before

NED
Not from me

JOAN
Youre no different from any other
guy-—

NED

Oh but I am I ama very special
human being noble and splendid--
At this moment a stocky young man thrusts himself between them
takes a firm grip on Joans upper arm and propels her quickly
away Ned sees the man talking furiously to the girl He watches
her bottom in tight slacks without emotion empties his glass
puts it on the bar and suddenly takes a running dive into the
pool The splash distresses various people along its edge who leap
backwards and scowl at the swimmer

A waiter is carefully pushing a hot dog wagon across the terrace
in front of the pool house The wagon is gaily painted and shaded
with a little striped umbrella The waiter parks it and is about
to begin serving hot dogs and buns just as Ned emerges from the
pool

Neds eyes are immediately fastened on the hot dog wagon Suddenly
his expression changes to one of astonishment and alarm He runs
over to it

NED
My God this looks like my wagon
(examines the
painted sides)
Im sure this is my wagon

He opens it and peers inside hastily pushing the hot dogs into an
untidy pile The waiter looks pained a few onlookers gather
around Ned bends closer to examine the bottom of the wagon

NED
(excited)
Hey this is mine

He straightens up and addresses the waiter

NED
Howd this thing get here

The waiter shrugs

NED

I wheel my kids around in it See
that

(points to something

at the bottom)
Thats where Ellen put her foot
through and I mended it with plywood
This is my wagon man

By this time Grace and Henry Biswanger have noticed whats going
on and approach along with several of the guests
clearly supporters of the Biswangers

GRACE
Whats the trouble here

NED
This is my hot dog wagon

GRACE
Well -- we bought it

NED
Bought it

GRACE

At a white elephant sale

NED
How the hell did it get to a white
elephant sale

GRACE
Your wife must have donated it--

NED
(trying to be patient)
She hadnt any right to do that
She knows Im crazy about this
thing--

HENRY
Take it up with her

NED
Listen Ill buy it back from you

HENRY
Not interested

NED
(in desperation)
Ill give you twice what you paid
for it Ill give you a hundred
dollars

HENRY
(laughs)

A hundred dollars For that piece of

The guests

are
junk

NED
(slowly and distinctly)
I want to buy this wagon back Name
a price Ill send you a check

HENRY
Oh yeah
(winking at the others)
Hell send me a check

NED
Im taking this thing home with me

He gets a firm hold on the handles

HENRY
Hands off you

He steps very close to Ned His face is menacing

HENRY
You crashed in -- now crash the hell
out

Ned glances at the ring of unfriendly faces around him

HENRY
Go on -- beat it

He gives Ned a push which knocks him off balance he stumbles
his ankle turns and he falls to the ground

Neds first impulse is to get up and punch Henry In an instant he
realizes that this would be beneath his dignity He rises slowly
to his feet

NED
(quietly)
Ill have my lawyers get in touch
with you tomorrow

HENRY
(laughing loudly)
Yeah you do that

Ned turns and hobbling a bit on his weak ankle he walks off
slowly his back straight his head high
The other guests stand silent and hostile watching him

Shirley Abbott
This is the most modest pool along Neds way -- small beautifully
planted and with an informal atmosphere -- as if all the decor
and the gardening had been done by the owner which indeed it has
The house looks more like a weekend hideaway than a conventional
suburban establishment

There are colorful chairs and tables and a large chaise longue on
the small terrace Scattered about are Shirleys possessions --
playscripts magazines sun tan oil dark glasses beach bag
terry cloth robe etc Also on a table is a well-stocked drink
tray

Shirley Abbott is an actress in her early thirties She has a
striking face handsome with interesting mobile features She is
unlike all the suburban women Ned has met along the way --
distinctly other She is wearing a dramatically cut bathing suit
At the moment she is sitting on the chaise a magnifying glass in
one hand a tweezers in the other and is apparently trying to get
a splinter out of her foot

Nearby is a flat of bulbs and some tools She has been working in
a garden bed close to the pool

Ned appears out of the trees at the opposite end of the pool
Shirley is not aware of his presence He watches her with an
expression of infinite yearning In a moment this changes to
uncertainty and anxiety He is totally unsure of what kind of
welcome he will get

As he comes forward Shirley looks up She is obviously astonished
anguished and angry in that order Then quickly she puts on a
look of total indifference relaxes back onto the chaise and
waits for him

SHIRLEY
(calmly)
What the hell are you doing here

NED
Wow New suit
SHIRLEY
(shrugs)
Its not new

NED
I dont remember that suit

SHIRLEY
Will you tell me what youre doing
here

NED

Im swimming home Pool by pool
across the county

SHIRLEY
(disgusted)
Good Christ will you ever grow up

She turns her attention back to the splinter She is unsuccessful
Ned kneels in front of her

NED
Let me try

SHIRLEY
Go away--

NED

Oh come on let me--

Gently he takes the tweezers from her and probes for the splinter

NED
I passed a first aid test when I was
a Scout -- got it

(looks at the tweezers)
Nope

(continues to probe)
Wasnt much in it about splinters
If you broke something I could make
you a beautiful splint

She winces

NED
Sorry--
(probes once more)
There we are
(examines the splinter)
A regular redwood You could cut a
hole in it and drive a car through

Shirley smiles in spite of herself Ned smiles back at her

Suddenly he presses his lips to her foot

She jerks it away with

such vehemence that he loses his balance and is sent sprawling

He sits up

NED
(puzzled)
Whatd you do that for

SHIRLEY
Keep away from me

puzzled

NED

You must be crazy Everybodys gone
crazy today Ive just come from the
Biswangers They snubbed me
Everyone at their party snubbed me--

(indignant)
--theyve even got my hot dog wagon
and they wont give it back

SHIRLEY
Your what

NED
I painted it myself and put the
little umbrella up Always kept it
down in the playroom where the
ping-pong table is remember

SHIRLEY
Ive never been in your house
remember

NED
(oblivious)
Lucinda gave it to a white elephant
sale

SHIRLEY
(sarcastically)

Im sure it was for a good cause

NED
She hadnt any right I ought to go
straight home and give her hell

SHIRLEY
Whats keeping you

She turns over on the chaise her back to him
Ned is hurt His shoulders droop

NED
Im tired Must have come six miles
Mind if I have a drink

SHIRLEY
(impatiently)
All right -- but hurry up about it

NED
(crosses to
the drink tray)
How about you Want a Bullshot

SHIRLEY
No thanks
NED
Oh come on -- you love the way I
make them
(holds up a

small bottle)
Hey were running out of Tabasco

SHIRLEY
We Arent you a little confused
this afternoon

Ned is behind her fixing the drinks Partly because he is
concentrating on what he is doing and partly deliberately he
doesnt really listen to what she is saying

SHIRLEY
(stretching out on
the chaise not
looking at him)
Well how goes it in Never-Never Land

NED
What
SHIRLEY
Has the ideal all-American family
found happiness in the big stone
house with the tennis court

NED
What

SHIRLEY
I heard a rumor that you had changed
your place of residence Moved out
of town

NED
Of course not Thats ridiculous
Wheres the pepper grinder Its not
here

SHIRLEY
Use the shaker I didnt think it
was true

NED
Should have freshly ground pepper
Thats what makes the difference

SHIRLEY
Well how is the President of the
League of Women Voters

NED
Who

SHIRLEY
How is your wife

NED
Oh shes fine

SHIRLEY
Ive been away so long I havent
kept up with the news Are all the
waitresses in town certified non-
venereal now

NED
What
SHIRLEY
Last I heard that was your wifes
project Physical checkups for food
handlers

NED
Yes Oh yes

SHIRLEY
Mrs Edward Merrill guardian of our
hamburgers Patron Saint of our
pizza pie

Ned oblivious of her sarcasm crosses to her with the two drinks

NED
Lucindas always done a lot of good
in this town

Shirleys eyes meet his

SHIRLEY
She just didnt do so good at home
huh

She takes her drink

NED
Well heres to sugar on our
strawberries

She holds her glass without drinking and glares at him

NED
(chastened)
Well -- cheers

They drink Shirleys face is blank Ned gives her a worried
glance The vodka revives his energy a bit He makes a visible
effort to get through to her

NED
Remember last winter in Toronto We
called Room Service and asked for
Bullshots and they said--

SHIRLEY
I wasnt in Toronto last winter
NED
Sure I came up for the opening of
your show Dont you remember how it
snowed And I hired a horse and
sleigh to take us from the hotel to
the theater

SHIRLEY
That was the winter before last

NED

(with a slight

frown of anxiety)
Was it in Boston What was the name
of that play in Boston

(all charm)
I came up on a Saturday remember
You faked a slipped disc and your
stand-by went on for the matinee I
cured your aching back didnt I

Shirley stares at him her eyes narrowed She presses her lips
together

NED
Acapulco was the best We tasted of
salt all over and the phone never
rang And all the nights were
silver--

SHIRLEY
(firmly)
Listen Ned I want you to go now
I mean it

NED
Why

SHIRLEY
Im expecting someone

NED
Who

SHIRLEY
None of your business who I dont

want you to be here when he comes

NED
A man

SHIRLEY
Naturally a man Do you think Ive
been in a deep freeze while youre
been playing house up on the hill

There is a pause They look at each other Ned begins to shiver
slightly He rubs his upper arms with his hands He coughs

NED

Im cold Whats happened to that
sun No heat in it

(coughs again)
Throats sore Dont know when Ive
been so cold

(almost to himself)
Not since those winters in Hanover
thats when Except I had my martini
coat

Shirley is ignoring him

NED
Hey Shirley did I ever tell you
about that coat

He crosses to sit beside her

NED
Did I Shirley

There is no answer

NED
Ive got to tell you about that
raccoon coat I had when I was at
Dartmouth--

SHIRLEY
Please
(with exasperation)
Spare me the tales of your glorious
youth

NED
(his enthusiasm
growing)
But this is a great story
SHIRLEY
I dont want to hear it

NED

(plunging on)
When my father was in college it
was Prohibition see So he bought
this raccoon coat and he took it
to a shoemaker He had the guy sew
leather pockets in the lining --
one for gin one for vermouth a
big one for a thermos of ice anda
little one for olives He designed
himself a martini coat

There is a disgusted reaction from Shirley

NED
Oh yes he had straps put in to hold
a shaker
(laughs)

Some guy my old man He didnt
forget a thing

Shirley leaps up and crosses to the flat of bulbs She picks up a
tool and starts digging in the flower bed

NED

(turns to face her)
Twenty-five years later when I was
a freshman he gave it to me Brother
Was I a sensation I didnt carry
any stuff around except to football
games but I wore it all the time
Ill have to bring that coat over
here and show it to you

(his eyes lighting)
You know something Shirley that
coat was the damnedest most
wonderful thing I ever owned If
Lucinda gave that coat to a white
elephant sale Ill kill her -- I
swear Ill kill her--

He looks off into the distance A long pause His voice softens

NED
Shirley what happened
SHIRLEY
hat happened to what

NED
Nothings turned out the way I
hought it would--

(haltingly)
--when I was a kid I believed in
things -- people used to be happier
when I was a kid -- it -- it seemed
as if everybody loved each other--

ct

SHIRLEY
Excuse me while I swallow the lump
in my throat

NED
(with genuine
puzzlement)
What happened

SHIRLEY
You got pushed out of your golden
play pen thats what

NED

I used to mow the lawn around our
house -- my mother paid me twenty-
five cents -- I can smell that
grass-—

(suddenly)
--its so fast People grow up and
then they die--

SHIRLEY
Ned for the last time will you
please go away

NED
Tell me whos coming over

SHIRLEY
I told you -- its none of your
business

NED

On a scale of one to ten how would
you rate him in bed
Shirley picks up her drink and tosses the contents into Neds
face Their eyes meet and hold in a long stare

NED
(his voice breaking)
Shirley -- Im sorry -- for whatever
I did--
SHIRLEY

(pulling herself

together all

brittle again)
You only did the usual red-blooded
married-man thing Took me out to
lunch and gave me that lecture on
the duties and obligations of a
husband and father

(smiles)
Its become a classic hasnt it
Republished every year in the
Readers Digest

Ned frowns with effort trying to follow her

SHIRLEY
It was the first time wed been to a
really chic restaurant in New York
-- right out in the open in front of
the people who count

NED
(suddenly recalling
it all)
You cried

SHIRLEY
I also raised my voice

NED
It tore me apart to see you crying--

SHIRLEY
Especially when everyone stared
(bitterly)
I figured it out later You chose
that place because you thought I
wouldnt dare make a fuss in front
of all those mink hats and stylish
Ned begins to shiver uncontrollably He coughs louder
He winds his arms about himself

ashen

fags and snotty waiters

NED
No--

SHIRLEY
Did you really think you could smash
my world with no more noise than the
tinkle of finger bowls

NED
I loved you -- I didnt know what to
do--

SHIRLEY

So you went back to your wife Well
that figures The real estate is in

her name She owns the pots and pans

She knows where the lost shirt
button is Why give up all those
comforts

(a thin smile)
I had my comforts too While you
were still on the train back to
Connecticut -- that groovy young
bellhop in my hotel -- a real
primitive No hang-ups

NED
(quietly)
Youre lying

SHIRLEY

When you got in and called me from
the station I put the phone down on
the pillow so he could listen too
All that sniveling about not hurting
your innocent wife and your innocent
children We had hysterics We had
to stuff the sheet in our mouths--

NED
Youre lying

SHIRLEY
Youll never know will you

Shirley rises

His face is
She is
truly concerned Her tone changes to one of compassion

SHIRLEY
Ned whats the matter with you

NED
(hardly able
to speak)
Im so cold Im just so cold

SHIRLEY

sweater
NED
No
SHIRLEY
Dont be a fool -- you must be

catching something--
She makes a move as if to go into the house

NED
No How can I swim in a sweater

SHIRLEY
Youll get pneumonia--—
(puts her hand
on his arm)
Listen Ill drive you home

NED
No
SHIRLEY
(her anxiety
increasing)

ridiculous
NED

NED

SHIRLEY

NED

impossible How can I

SHIRLEY
My God whats happened to you
Somethings wrong with you

NED
Lucindas waiting -- the girls are
home playing tennis-- Im swimming

home--
Neds whole body is shaking spasmodically

Alarmed Shirley keeps watching him She picks up her terry cloth
robe and puts it over his shoulders This act is the first really
tender gesture he has experienced all afternoon He turns to her
with gratitude as if her gesture has been a proof that she still
loves him Shirley understands the extent of her revelation In an
attempt to negate the moment she turns away and picks up a bottle
of sun tan oil She crosses to the chaise longue and sits down

Neds shivering gradually subsides He has control of himself
again

NED
There -- thats better--

Shirley is rubbing the oil on her arms Ned crosses to her and
sits beside her

NED
Let me do your back

SHIRLEY
No--

NED
(reaches for the bottle)
Please let me

Reluctantly Shirley turns over on her stomach Gently Ned begins
to stroke the oil into her back His touch the feel of his hand
on her flesh brings memories flooding Her eyes begin to fill
with tears

NED
Shirley listen lets go off
together for a couple of weeks -- I
could manage it right after the
fourth--

SHIRLEY
The fourth Do you mean the fourth
of July

NED

(rubbing her back

and shoulders)
I read about a great old castle in
Ireland A real one with a moat and
a drawbridge Some king built it
hundreds of years ago Its an inn
now with crazy old four-posters--

SHIRLEY
Ned please -- please go away--

NED
Big soft beds with canopies--
(bends over her)
Come with me Shirley

SHIRLEY
Do you think you can just reappear
and move in again Do you think its
that easy

She whirls around to give him a long appraising look

SHIRLEY
Everythings always been easy for
you hasnt it
(her voice breaks)
God knows I was easy enough to get

NED
You wore a blue slip with a safety
pin holding up the shoulder strap
(presses his mouth
to her shoulder
I kissed your safety pin
SHIRLEY
(moves away
close to tears)
Dont do that--

NED
(puts his arms
around her)
I only want you to love me--

SHIRLEY

(thrusts herself

away and leaps up)
hats your hang-up Neddy-boy
outre afraid the sky will fall down
f everybody doesnt love you Youll
ose the popularity contest you
ont be elected Head Boy -- as if
he whole worlds a prep school

tePeKY

This truth reaches Ned He grasps at her blindly desperate for
the only pain-killer he knows He locks his arms around her and
pushes her back on the chaise his body almost on top of her his
mouth searching for hers

SHIRLEY
Dont Dont do that Leave me
alone

She struggles to push him away

NED
(holding her tighter)
You dont want me to You know you
dont

She struggles furiously to get away from him Finally she wrests
herself free and leaps to her feet

SHIRLEY
Dont touch me

He leaps up after her and they struggle She gets away from him
runs to the pool and plunges in He jumps in after her She swims
only a few strokes before he has caught her

SHIRLEY
Stop it Stop Let go
He is holding her close his hand tangled in her hair to pull her
face back to make her look at him

NED
We made love in this pool remember
You loved it

SHIRLEY
I lied

He is trying to pull down the straps of her bathing suit She is
kicking and hitting at him

NED
You loved it in the pool

He has the straps of her bathing suit down She is half naked She
continues to fight him desperately

They wrestle in the water The bathing suit rips Finally she
pulls away from him and swims a few feet She rushes sobbing and
outraged up the steps of the pool Ned is standing waist-high in
the water Holding her tattered suit up to cover herself Shirley
screams at him

SHIRLEY
I lied I lied all the time Telling
you I loved it anywhere with you
You bored me to death Boasting
about your deals and your golf
scores and your old girls and your
old war and your old bloody duty to
your wife and kids

NED
(quietly)
You loved it

SHIRLEY
I played a scene with you

NED
(urgently)
You loved it

SHIRLEY
It was a fake I was fooling you
You met your match in me you
suburban stud Im an actress
Her words are like a fist smashed into Neds face His eyes are
wild his mouth slack He throws back his head and bellows to the
sky

NED
YOU LOVED IT

Crying hysterically Shirley turns and runs toward the house She
disappears inside Neds expression is stony and vacant After a
moment he swims automatically to the end of the pool He grasps
the curb to hoist himself out but he has difficulty The strength
is drained out of him He struggles His face is contorted with
the effort

Finally wearily hand over hand grasping the curb he moves to
the ladder and totally defeated he climbs up it When he steps
off onto the ground his whole body seems limp and fragile His
eyes are sunken His face is a ruin

14
The Thruway

The sun is clouded over Rain is imminent Ned is on the side of
the road limp shivering his arms wrapped around himself The
Sunday traffic is heavy Cars of all descriptions whiz by Ned
looks pitiful as he waits on the shoulder of the road Every time
he thinks he might have a chance to dash for the grass divider in
the middle of the road a car comes hurtling toward him and he
jumps back

He is the object of all kinds of scorn and ridicule from the
occupants of the cars Some peer at him as if he is crazy some
point and laugh a beer can is thrown at him He dodges it
Several people shout at him but he cant decipher the words From
the backs of station wagons little children make faces thumbs in
their ears waggling their fingers No one makes the least attempt
to slow up to let him cross In fact some drivers seeing his
intention speed up gleefully as they approach him

Ned feels the indignity of his position and appearance He looks
tense and miserable He coughs He hops up and down to warm
himself

Finally an old man tooling down the highway at fifteen miles an
hour gives him a chance to cross He dashes for the grass divider
and makes it safely Now he has to buck the long lines of traffic
speeding in the other direction

The same ridicule from this traffic is heaped upon him

He watches

alertly for a chance to cross Finally there is a gap in the
traffic and he sprints to the other side of the highway

15
Recreation Center Pool

A sign above the ticket booth window says Adults 50 cents

children 25 cents The ticket seller is a young man
muscular He wears a T-shirt Ned is arguing with him

NED
--but Ill pay you back I swear to
God I will

THE YOUNG MAN
(shakes his head)
Against the rules

NED
Ill do whatever you want -- Ill
sign an IOU

THE YOUNG MAN
(shakes his head)

NED

THE YOUNG MAN

NED

THE YOUNG MAN

buck Thats all Im supposed to

stocky and
NED
Cant you make an exception this

(gestures)
Ill come straight back with the
money Believe me I will

He grasps the ticket cage and shakes it his urgency growing

NED
I swear I promise

THE YOUNG MAN
Get your hands off there

Neds eyes begin to tear His tone changes

NED
Listen will you please please lend
me fifty cents

THE YOUNG MAN
What for Why the hell should I

NED
Ill pay you back--

His body sags against the booth

NED
Dont you realize Ill pay you
back

THE YOUNG MAN
Beat it

At this point a middle-aged man and woman walk up to the booth
carrying bathing suit bags The man is bald and wears a loud sport
shirt The woman is plump and wears slacks Their names are Howie
and Lillian Hunsacker Ned smiles with relief and recognition

NED
Howie

HOWIE
Hello Mr Merrill

NED
Howie for Christ sake will you
lend me fifty cents

LILLIAN
(angrily)
Dont you do it Howie

HOWIE
Whats fifty cents more or less
considering

He digs in his pocket and gives Ned the money

NED

(with enormous relief)
Thanks Howie Youre a lifesaver

(thrusts the money at

the young man then

again to Howie)
Thanks a lot chum Thanks an awful
lot

He rushes through the turnstile and disappears into the locker
room There are a couple of people ahead of him at the counter
where baskets for clothes and dog tags are given out He gets into
line until he realizes that he has no need for a basket He starts
to cross to the open door to the pool area

ATTENDANT
(shouting)
Hey Hey you Hey you in the trunks

Ned turns

ATTENDANT
You take a shower

Ned shakes his bead

ATTENDANT
Cantcha read buddy

He points to a large sign Ned looks at it
ALL SWIMMERS MUST TAKE A SHOWER BEFORE USING THE POOL
ALL SWIMMERS MUST USE THE FOOT BATH

ALL SWIMMERS MUST WEAR THEIR IDENTIFICATION DISCS
Ned crosses to a shower booth enters closes the door turns the
water on full force stands under it a split-second turns off the
water and leaves the booth He crosses to the open door again

An attendant beside the foot bath glares at his feet battered
scratched and still filthy

ATTENDANT
You take a shower

Ned nods

ATTENDANT
Go back and wash those feet

Wearily Ned crosses back to the shower The booths are all
occupied now He feels dizzy The room reels before his eyes He
closes his eyes and leans against a shower door for support The
door opens suddenly and Ned falls in upon the man coming out

The man grabs him by the shoulders and pushes him back He gives
him a dirty look and walks out Ned enters the shower This time
he soaps his feet and rinses them under the water wincing as he
does so They are bruised and sore The soap hurts the cuts
Gently his hands rub them again and again to get the dirt off His
dizziness returns for a moment He supports himself against the
side of the booth He comes out of the shower and crosses again to
the attendant beside the door The attendant gives him a surly
look and then gazes at his feet with distaste

ATTENDANT
(rudely)
Spread your toes

Ned balances on one foot while he spreads his toes with his hands
The attendant peers into the crevices between them Ned repeats
this business with the other foot

ATTENDANT
Bottoms

Ned holds up the sole of each foot in turn The attendant waves
him on He steps into the foot bath and through the door The rain
clouds hang even lower now There is thunder in the distance

The pool area is surrounded by a high wire mesh fence It is
jammed with people of all ages and all sizes shouting splashing
The lifeguards sit on high wooden platforms at intervals blowing
their whistles or bellowing through a public address system
various warnings and instructions to the swimmers The pool has
been constructed at the bottom of a high slanting hill -- almost a
wall of irregular rocks

The shrill sound of voices the activity confuse Ned at first He

looks about uncertain at which end of the pool to begin his swim

He finally figures out which is the deep end and crosses toward it
A couple of children run into him and almost knock him down

LIFEGUARD
(through the public
address system)
Cut out the running you two kids
No running in the pool area

Ned finds an empty place in the pool and plunges in It is an
awkward tired dive his body is bent his legs fly apart He
comes up sputtering with disgust at the taste of the chlorine in
the water With difficulty he continues his way toward the other
end of the pool keeping his head above water to avoid collisions
but even so he is bumped into splashed and jostled

At one point a young boy dives from the side of the pool lands on
top of Ned and submerges him Ned comes up spitting out water
breathing hard half-drowned A girl practicing an awkward crawl
slaps her hand across his face

As Ned makes his way across the pool he is watched grimly by Howie
and Lillian now in their bathing suits and another couple whom
they have joined The other couple are a few years younger than
the Hunsackers but the expressions on their faces are equally
sour They are Jack and Sylvia Finney

As Ned reaches the shallow end all four of them rise and approach
the place where he will be getting out Ned has to stand and walk
through the last few feet of the pool since the water is barely
higher than his knees He is bumped into at every step splashed
pushed A whistle blows shrilly and a guards megaphone is pointed
at him

LIFEGUARD
(bellowing)
Hey you You without the
identification disk Get outta the
water

Ned is not aware that he is being shouted at He stumbles on
dizzy half-blinded and weak Finally he grasps the ladder and
painfully gasping pulls himself up
The two couples have placed themselves so that they block his way
They make no attempt to move

JACK
Whatsa matter Mr Merrill your
friends pools run outta water

NED
What

JACK
So how do you like our water Mr
Merrill

NED

Oh hi Jack Sure is a lot of
chlorine in it

LILLIAN
Stings your eyes a little huh

HOWIE
(the one friendly voice)
Aint seen you in a dogs age Mr
Merrill Too bad you dont get into
town any more

NED
(warmly with relief)
We had a lot of laughs together

HOWIE

NED
(suddenly)

HOWIE
(warning her)

LILLIAN
(loudly)

The altercation has attracted attention Several onlookers have
moved nearer

HOWIE
(to Lil Jack
and Sylvia)
Lets break it up Come on lets
not have a fuss in public--—

Nobody moves Jack is aware of the audience and plays up to them

JACK
You shoulda seen the orders I sent

SYLVIA

The onlookers snicker

The onlookers laugh Ned looks around confused

SYLVIA

The onlookers laugh again Ned has hardly understood the words

JACK

kids We all got kids to feed too--

SYLVIA

behave themselves Our kids dont go

JACK
(more or less to
the onlookers)
He kept his daughters names outta
the paper that time

LILLIAN
Bet that check didnt bounce

Ned stares dizzily around at the curious amused or grim faces
He feels cornered humiliated He begins to shiver again

NED
You leave my daughters out of this

SYLVIA
Why didnt ya teach em some
manners

LILLIAN
(to Sylvia)
Those girls never paid no attention
to him Why should they

(to Ned)
Always runnin around chummin with

NED
(his voice shaking)
My daughters worship me -- they love

girls because Im their father and
they respect me--

(close to tears)
--they respect me--

LILLIAN

LILLIAN
(to the others)
Plenty of times we used to hear

NED

HOWIE
(angry)
Now look here Mr Merrill -- you

NED

HOWIE
(giving him a good
long hard look)
Wanna know what your girls really
thoughta you Your girls laughed at
you--

Ned stares at him -- he wont believe it
HOWIE

I heard them Your girls thought you
were a great big joke

his last wound triggers Neds panic He feels suffocated by the
ing of strange faces and bodies All he can think of is that he
ust get out get away He thrusts blindly at Howie with enough
orce to throw him to the ground Women scream The guards blow
heir ear-splitting whistles The crowd increases in an instant

tqmhsnH

Ned dashes through them -- pushing at anyone in his way --
straight for the wire fence He climbs it nimbly given a new
spurt of strength by his consuming desire to escape As he goes
over the top he tears his flesh in several places on the sharp
wires

He leaps to the rocks and scrambles frantically up the hill like a
wild animal -- clinging to clumps of grass slipping and sliding
on the slippery surface intent only on fleeing his tormentors A
few drops of rain are falling

16
The Clydes

The back yard of a modest ranch house on a small lot A half dozen
adults -- men in loud sport shirts and shorts women bulgy in
pedal pushers and several small children are hurriedly
dismantling what was to have been a picnic supper

Apparently they have waited hoping it was not going to rain but
now the sky is slate-colored and the rumble of thunder frequent A
charcoal grill is already blazing but unused and they are taking
plates of frankfurters hamburgers potato salad and trays of beer
into the kitchen In the center of the back yard is a very large
round plastic wading pool the kind used by children

Ned comes around the side of the house cold exhausted walking
with the greatest effort The people in the yard stop what they
are doing and stare at him

Ned is transfixed at the sight of the pool He stumbles toward it
With visible effort he swings one leg over the rim of the pool and
then the other The water barely reaches to the middle of his
thigh He crouches down in the water and begins to paddle across
like a little child The adults exchange glances The children
watch with mouths agape

MAN
(low voice)
What the hells going on

MR CLYDE
Soused

MAN
You know him

MR CLYDE
(gesturing up the hill)

Thats his house up there

Ned is half way across A large inflated rubber duck is floating
in his path He rests his cheek on it

WOMAN
(laughing)
Look at that

ANOTHER WOMAN
(laughing)
Makes himself right at home

MAN
(laughing)
Soused out of his skull

The children take their cue from the adults and laugh too A
little boy tosses a soft rubber beach ball at Ned It bounces
crazily off his head They scream with glee

Ned climbs out of the pool Mrs Clyde is standing in his path He
stops takes her hand bows and kisses it briefly He drops her
hand and staggers toward the road The sound of laughter follows
him

(17
The Merrills

Ned is coming up a narrow winding road He is weaving a bit from
side to side His chest is heaving as if every breath takes all
his strength From time to time he coughs Raindrops are
splattering down on him

His foot slips and he falls to his knees The raindrops increase
He wipes them away leaving the dirt of the road on his face He
struggles to his feet

Ned comes to the gatepost of his own driveway stops and clings to
it for support There is a streak of lightning overhead and
thunder very loud and close By now the rain is falling steadily
It seems to rouse him a bit He leaves the gatepost and plods up
the curving driveway

Ahead of him is his house -- large grand rather formal It is
set on a spacious lawn A tennis court is visible at one side and
to the back Once in a while lightning illuminates the entire
scene

The raindrops are more frequent now With a last spurt of energy
Ned quickens his step The crescent-shaped drive curves up to the
front door He manages a limping run the last few yards to the
house
He turns the knob and pushes at the door in his hurry to get
inside The door is locked He is astounded and tries the knob
again The door will not budge He frowns with confusion and turns
the knob frantically back and forth

Now the rain is coming in a downpour He pounds on the door He
tries to force it open with his shoulder The rain is flooding
down upon him In desperation he beats his fists against the door
Lightning flashes over the house Thunder crashes above Ned
shouts -- not words but deep bellows of anguish
The door is solid By contrast Neds flailing fists seem puny and
fragile He beats continuously at the impervious oak The veins
stand out in his neck as he shouts convulsively There is terror
in his eyes His fists pound and pound

The windows of the house are dark Behind them is the unlit and
dimly visible living room It is totally empty -- rectangles of
pale paint on the wall where pictures once hung a fireplace with
tarnished andirons in it Some cardboard cartons filled with
cast-offs -- wire hangers broken tennis racket a worn broom --
are against the wall

In the library the shelves are empty except for a tattered
telephone book In the small mirrored bar there is nothing but a
corkscrew on the counter

The kitchen is large and well-equipped but dusty An old calendar
and a bulletin board hang on one wall A scrap of paper
thumbtacked to the board reads Slip covers -- CA 7-4333

In the spacious paneled dining room one of the wall sconces has
come loose and is hanging by its cord

At the end of the entrance hall is the heavy front door The knob
is moving back and forth back and forth

Outdoors it is darker The downpour has lessened to a light rain
Neds exhausted hand is turning the knob He no longer pounds His
body is slumped against the door He is uttering small gasping
sounds His eyes are streaming with tears
