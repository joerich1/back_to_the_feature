NOWHERE

Darkness first

Then a glint of light

A band of cold steel turning in the gloom

Spinning Flashing

We push slowly back to reveal first that we are looking at the edge of a straight razor and then
that the razor itself is reflected in the dark pupil ofa staring eye

The eye fills the screen the razor swimming in its depths turning slashing at the

darkness We hear the distorted wail of a harmonica on the soundtrack almost like the cry of an
animal in pain

The retina widens pulsing

There is a soft whoompf of igniting gasoline and suddenly the eye is filled by a wall of orange
flame wiping the razor from view

We move forwards into the flame back into the depths of the eye

DISSOLVE TO

A close up ofa cave painting a closed spiral daubed in what looks like dried blood on a rock
wall

2 EXTERIOR DAY THE OVERHANG

We are in the shadows of what appears to be a jumble of volcanic rocks looking out towards
the clear sky and violent light of the desert outside

A dark man is sitting in the shadows with us watching the vultures outside circle slowly riding
the high thermals

His gnarled hand sifts and pours the dust

His name is JOE

JOE NIEMAND

He’s a full blood bushman and according to most he’s a little soft in the head
Today as usual he’s hard at work

Drawing pattems in the dust

The wind catches the dust as it slips through his fingers and we follow it out into the airless
flatlands

CUT TO
3 EXTERIOR DAWN THE GREAT NAMIB

JOE (VOICE OVER)
Back in the first times in the time of the red light the
wind Soo-oop-wa was a man like us until by
mischance he grew wings and flew like a bird

We are rising

Flying

Soaring out over the canyons where night still lingers swooping circling on the morning
over an alien breathless world of orange rock and trackless sand

JOE (VOICE OVER)
He became a hunter and like a hawk flew to seek
his prey But having once been a man so does he
still suffer the passions of a man flying in rages
sometimes and throwing himself down like a child
to vent his wrath upon the earth

A ribbon appears

A crack across the landscape
A river of asphalt

We descend towards it

CUT TO

4 EXTERIOR DAY THE ROAD
The air here is quicksilver

A rippling curtain across the moming

You see him first here conjuring himself from nothing a dancing ghost walking the white line
warping in and out of shape as if crossing over from one world to another a solitary travelling
man A white man

His name is HITCH

There is a low tremor A bass rumble like distant thunder

HITCH hears the sound and even though he knows there is no chance of rain he scans the sky
anyway There’s a military backpack riding on his shoulders and from his travel worn hat and
coat and his regular loping gait we can tell he’s been walking for a long time

Longer than he remembers now

He checks his watch and then bending puts his ear to the white line listening to the road
There is a glimmer in the heat haze

Something swimming into life in the far distance

Sunlight flashing on metal
4 EXTERIOR DAY THE ROAD

HITCH lowers his backpack waiting

The car pulls closer riding on air

HITCH takes a breath stepping slowly out into the road
The sun glints on the windshield

He raises his hand

It is an old car a sun beat car
It rattles as it slows and pulls in to the soft shoulder
HITCH strolls after it

The car’s driver winds down her window Her name is SAARTJIE HAARHOF She’s in her
early forties German South West African

Face like a hatchet Eyes tired initially hostile but then the look of curiosity below that and her
attempts to hide the terrible longing the loneliness that made her slow the car the half shameful
needing that HITCH is so familiar with

He smiles at her

As he bends to reach for the door handle his eyes catch the reflection of the sun for a moment in
the rear view mirror

CUT TO

5 EXTERIOR DAY THE OVERHANG

JOE clenches his hand

He glances back over his shoulder at the rock painting

CUT TO

6 EXTERIOR DUSK THE HOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE DESERT

It is evening already and they are on the verandah of her house an old farmhouse building on a
desiccated homestead

HITCH puts down the groceries he has carried from the boot of her car while SAARTJIE
fumbles to find her keys

She seems distracted

She glances back at him

Sees the light dying over his shoulder

Sees the dust in his eyes

SAARTJIE
Who are you

HITCH smiles and raising a polaroid camera he snaps her photograph freezing her
uncertainty on film

The key turns in the lock

CUT TO
7 EXTERIOR DUSK THE OVERHANG

JOE’s hand touches the rock painting
His fingers retrace the spiral
The serpent of cosmic energy descending into manifestation

CUT TO
8 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

The wind rises now gusting up across the dunes It breathes life into the sheets on SAARTJIE’s
washing line and draws a howl from the empty milk bottles beside the kitchen door

It drives against the metal blades of the borehole’s windvane turning them driving them faster
the gears of the windvane whimpering in protest

CUT TO
9 INTERIOR NIGHT THE BEDROOM

The bed rattles and on the nightstand a row of framed photographs and dusty mementoes
tremble from the force

An unreachable husband

Lost children

The timbers of the house creak and settle around them as HITCH makes love to SAARTJIE
She has become putty in his hands

He takes her to the edge and holds her there

She becomes a little girl again

He smiles and kisses her gently on the forehead

He touches her so tenderly

She moans a dry moan drawn from some place in her that was almost forgotten Sanded in
His hands frame her face cradle her and lift her holding tighter now

The moans become a sigh of relief

The hands tighten

Twist

There is a sharp crack

He lifts her hugging her tight to himself comforting her riding out her death spasms

Afterwards the pathologists will find that the cause of death was a dislocated neck her spinal
cord severed at the juncture of the atlas and axial vertebrae

But the hunting knife is in HITCH’s hand now
She is barely dead and already the blade is flashing as he works on her

The blood dews his face and HITCH raises his head and howls

CUT TO
10 INTERIOR NIGHT THE CHARGE OFFICE

The telephone on the dusty wooden counter suddenly begins to ring
An old man answers

A tired man

A cop

His name is BAREND ALBERTUS MUKUROB
He was bom in the Namib and plans on dying there
He was a soldier first and a father once but now he is just a cop

His friends call him BEN
BEN
Bethany station Charge office
Hallo
There is no reply
BEN

Hallo

A tustle of static

BEN hangs up

A moment later the ‘phone begins to ring again

This time he doesn’t answer

He hears the wind whisper around the outside of the station
He glances around the office

He is alone

He feels uneasy without knowing why

CUT TO

11 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

The wind ripples across the flatlands

It murmurs in the marching telegraph pylons caressing the wires breathing static down the
lines

CUT TO

12 INTERIOR NIGHTO THE BEDROOM OF THE ROBINSON HOUSE

Six hundred kilometres south the ‘phone rings on the bedside table of a small suburban home
and WENDY ROBINSON stirs in her sleep beside her husband MARK turns over and sits up

nibbing her eyes trying to remember her dream She lifts the receiver worried not knowing
why the ‘phone should ring so late
12 INTERIOR NIGHT THE BEDROOM OF THE ROBINSON HOUSE

WENDY
Hullo Robinson house Hullo
Who is this

No reply comes save for the static

She lowers the receiver and slowly replaces it on the hook beside the wedding photograph

Her and MARK

The white dress the green lawn MARK grinning like a teenager in his uniform holding her by
the arm her eyes distant as if dazzled by the photographer’s flash

The telephone does not ring again but WENDY sits for a while anyway on the edge of the bed
not wanting to go back to sleep

She glances at her watch

It is almost 3am

She closes her eyes

CUT TO
13 INTERIOR NIGHT THE HAARHOF HOUSE

HITCH’s hand sends the clock flying from the mantelpiece and it explodes on the floor amidst
the falling photographs becoming a mess of bouncing cogwheels and splintering glass

HITCH laughs like a hyena

Yelling

Dancing through the house

Nakedness streaked with blood

Arms flailing overturning furniture sweeping pictures from the walls no room spared his
wrath

He pauses hovering plucking from the debris the materials of his work
The shards of the broken mirror

The torn pages of the bible

The springs of the clock and the scattered photographs

The bedroom is ablaze with candles now

SAARTIIE’s body is laid out on the bed an array of knives and razors glistening beside it
He kneels beside the bed positioning the bowl

Then slowly reverently intimately he begins his work

CUT TO
14 EXTERIOR DAWN THE DESERT
The wind murmurs to itself and dies

The blades of the windvane slow

The telegraph lines are silent

A red sun begins to rise over a breathless world
CUT TO

15 INTERIOR DAWN THE SHOWER
HITCH’s eyes are closed

Face turned towards the showerhead

Blood washing off him

Rejoicing in the rain

He doesn’t see the sunrise

CUT TO
16 INTERIOR DAWN THE BEDROOM

A starling flutters into the room perching for a while on the window sill
Then the alarm clock begins to ring and it takes flight

The electric alarm sounds distorted slightly off key remarkable that it is still working
considering the damage to its casing

HITCH doesn’t pay much attention to the alarm
He’s dressed now and tidying up preparing to leave

He lifts his pack over one shoulder and takes a last look back as he leaves the bedroom

The blinds are still drawn but even in the half light you can see the dripping murals
The twisted crimson sheets

HITCH closes the door letting the alarm clock ring

CUT TO
17 EXTERIOR DAWN THE VERANDAH

HITCH places SAARTJIE’s fingers safely in a yellow cooling bag and puts them on the
passenger seat of the car

He slings his pack into the back seat and then opens up the boot to fetch the spare tank of
gasoline
17 EXTERIOR DAWN THE VERANDAH

He humps it up onto the verandah pausing to polish the front doorknob before disappearing
back into the lounge When he reappears he’s holding an old radio under one arm He plugs it
in placing it on the verandah table Then he rolls a cigarette and lights it watching the day grow
brighter sipping from a cup of coffee the radio crackling into life A morning service A
PREACHER’s voice

PREACHER
Lord we pray to you for release from
this drought Send us the soft rains of
your mercy The Earth cries out to you
The cattle die in their fields The crops
wither in the springtime

HITCH stubs out his cigarette and hefts the gasoline can

18 INTERIOR DAWN THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

HITCH dances through the house emptying the gas can splashing its contents everywhere
Working his way backwards towards the front door

PREACHER
Forgive us Lord and send us the power
to forgive Send our leaders wisdom
and send us peace in these troubled times
Send us the peace of your rain like a cooling
hand against our brows

When he reaches the verandah HITCH throws away the can and lights a match sending it
fluttering back into the lounge whooping as he hears the whoompf of igniting gasoline
behind him dancing to the car

PREACHER
We will watch for evil and drive it
from our hearts and from our lands

The flames are already licking hungrily up the walls

Orange tongues rising everywhere

Ribbons of smoke laced with sparks push through the bedroom floorboards The bloodstained
sheets begin to smoulder

Firelight flickers once more across the murals as the blood turns slowly black

Great jagged shards of darkening colour everywhere

Slashes like the imprint of tropical foliage a shadow in blood of spreading leaves wings and
reaching hands
18 INTERIOR DAWN THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

Beneath the leaves stands a figure already embraced by fire
The outline of a man solarized head ringed by auric energy bis internal organs sketched in
diagrammatically like choice cuts of meat

PREACHER
Verily my children take heed of the
shadow that comes in the morning
lift up your eyes to the evil that lurks
therein for even as the drought raises
the harvest and the fire blasts the
cornfield of the farmer so shall the evil
of this shadow smite thee even the innocent
and the babe that smiles in the arms of

his mother
CUT TO
19 EXTERIOR DAY THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

HITCH stands beside the car watching the flames take hold
When it begins to get too hot he gets in the car and drives away

Behind him the house diminishes into a blur of black smoke and orange fare A greasy black
cloud in the morning sky caught by the wind we climb with it letting ourselves be sucked
away with the ashes strewn out across the desert sky

PREACHER
Look to the east into the wasteland
for from thence cometh the evil His shadow
falleth across the ways of the righteous and
maketh them as cold dust the sun has gone
out from their pastures and the shadow bas
blighted their being

CUT TO

20 EXTERIOR DAY THE SUBURBS

We are looking down on a tract of South African suburbia from the air

A patchwork of identical rooftops square green lawns and glistening blue swimming

pools
We are moving slowly downwards towards one of the houses
20 EXTERIOR DAY THE SUBURBS

PREACHER
Therefore petition the Lord thy God Let thy
prayers rise like a fountain Let thy eyes be
filled with his memories for true repentance
be thine the evil that walks by day in the
wasteland shall at eventide be consumed

CUT TO
21 INTERIOR DAY THE ROBINSON HOUSE

A black cat is slinking across the polished tiles of the kitchen floor it mounts the counter and
we follow it surveying the immaculately fitted room The washing machine the garbage
disposal a row of kitchen knives clinging to a magnetic strip the microwave the blender the
shopping list pinned to the freezer door

PREACHER
Yeah verily by his own teeth shall he be torn by
his own snare may his back be broken and in a pit
of his own digging may his bones be thrown

We pan into a close up of WENDY’s face
Eyes flaring with anger
An expression of contempt

WENDY
STAY THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME

MARK ’s hand strikes her through the face and she staggers backwards against the counter
MARK steps towards her crying reaching out

WENDY
(Blood coming from her lip)
Don’t come any closer

MARK
Wendy It’s me Mark

WENDY
Don’t touch me I hate you

She grabs the cat from the counter and hurls it at MARK’s head
The cat shrieks and the air is full of claws and yelps and flying fur

WENDY pushes past into the lounge grabbing her handbag shoving things into it MARK
appears in the doorway behind her His shirt has come untucked from his shorts and his face is
red and ugly filled with tears During business hours he runs a small sports shop downtown but
right now he’s a little distraught
21 INTERIOR DAY THE ROBINSON HOUSE

MARK
What about your letters I still have
your letters You told me you loved me
while all the time

WENDY
Yes Say it While all the time I’m fucking
around I fuck around with everybody
every time you’re gone right

MARK
(Raising his hand)
Wendy don’t make me So help me God

WENDY
(Picking up her bag)
You can’t stop me

She steps towards the door reaching the handle and he grabs her
She struggles to get free and he throws her to the ground

MARK
(Pausing his hand raised)
Do you know what this is for

She grabs at him trying to get up and he starts hitting her She begins to scream

MARK
Stop screaming Don’t scream like that
For fuck’s sake What will the neighbours
think

WENDY shuts up Crying Nursing her head
MARK
You fucking bitch You did sleep with him
didn’t you You bitch Don’t you understand
that I fucking love you
He lowers his head and begins to cry
WENDY gets the door open and slips out into the front yard
MARK
Come back Wendy I want to talk

to you

CUT TO
22 EXTERIOR DAY THE ROBINSON’S FRONT LAWN

WENDY makes a dash for the garage wiping the running mascara from her eyes
A bunch of schoolkids run past her laughing kicking a football They collide with MARK
slowing him down WENDY grapples with the garage door and MARK shouts after her

MARK
Wendy Stop

He kicks away the football and the children run after it

CUT TO
23 INTERIOR DAY THE GARAGE

WENDY climbs into her car rummaging in her bag for her keys cursing to herself The car is a
red Volkswagen with a “Save The Whales” sticker and a Phoenix decall on the back window

The name of the car is HAMISH
WENDY finds the key and jams it into the ignition The engine chugs into life just as MARK
ducks into the garage

MARK
What’s going to happen to us

WENDY
It’s up to you

MARK
Talk to me

WENDY
Ihave to go

MARK
Wendy

WENDY slams the car into reverse as MARK reaches out and he has to dive for cover
sprawling awkwardly onto the front lawn foot caught in the flower bed

CUT TO
24 EXTERIOR DAY DRIVEWAY

MARK
Don’t go Please Don’t leave me

WENDY roars away down the street in a haze of exhaust fumes
MARK staggers limping awkwardly into the road behind her shouting after her

MARK
T’ll follow you

WENDY reaches out to turn on the car radio drowning his cries with a burst of rock and roll
The kids run past him kicking the ball away down the street

CUT TO
25 EXTERIOR DAY THE SUBURBS

We are looking down once more from the air
Watching WENDY’s Volkswagen dwindle a speck of red in the labyrinth of houses

CUT TO
26 EXTERIOR DAY THE GREAT NAMIB

We are circling

Following the freeway circling the place where it touches the railway line looking down on the
small cluster of houses that marks this spot

Looking down on the dusty streets and sorry corrugated iron roofs of the town of Bethany

The screech of cattle truck wheels rises towards us from the railway shunting yards where
bony herds are being crammed into their berths for the long haul down to the abattoirs in
Cape Town

27 INTERIOR DAY BEN’S BEDROOM

The room literally trembles from the vibration of the passing trains

On the mantelpiece a framed photograph rattles uneasily A Nama woman and child
somewhere in the past now seated on a distant green lawn a football in the child’s hands
Her eyes distant but still beautiful

BEN grunts in his sleep but does not wake He has become used to the sound of the trains He
stirs and turning over he puts one arm around his dog WATCHER who has crept onto his bed
during the night

Then the telephone begins to ring

WATCHER looks up ears pricked as BEN tries to cover his head with his pillow moaning
something unintelligible

WATCHER takes it upon himself to get BEN up and starts to lick his face
27 INTERIOR DAY BEN’S BEDROOM

When BEN opens his eyes the first thing he sees is the tongue of what seems to be a mongrel
hybrid of Rottweiler Rhodesian Ridgeback and possibly something even uglier coming at him

BEN
Fuck off Watcher

He shoves the dog off the bed and sits up rubbing his head listening to the sound of squealing
brakes coming from the shunting yard After a while he picks up the ‘phone

BEN
Ya Mukurob

LNT BEYMAN
Get your breeches on Ben We’re going to
need you We’ve got something

BEN
Better be a big show Kornelius
I haven’t had much sleep

LNT BEYMAN
We’ve got an arson here Ben possibly
even homicide One of the farmsteads

BEN
Ah fuck It’s too early in the morning
for another suicide

LNT BEYMAN
I said homicide Peace keeping troops
turned it up this morning Now get to
Sonneblom that’s the Haarhoff farm
turn off’s about two hundred kilometres
down the Keetmanshoop road Now Ben

BEN
Ya Kornelius I’m on my way huh

BEN puts down the ‘phone and sits for a while rubbing his eyes

CUT TO

28 EXTERIOR DAY DOWNTOWN BETHANY

A curtain of dust is migrating across the main road and BEN bas to slow the landrover as his

visibility diminishes At this time of day the rest of the town seems almost deserted The dust
cloud seems golden in the morning light
28 EXTERIOR DAY DOWNTOWN BETHANY

Through the haze of dust we are able now to make out the gaudily painted buildings the small
fenced gardens the low prefabricated rooftops of the schoolhouse the empty grain silos the
rusting water tanks crouched like spiders on the flatland the sunlight already harsh on the white
spire of the church

CUT TO
29 INTERIOR DAY BEN’S LANDROVER

The landrover is an olive coloured four wheeled drive complete with two way radio There’s
just enough room in the front seat for three at a pinch although today like most days
WATCHER is BEN’s only passenger

BEN squints into the murk outside the windscreen
The dust makes his eyes water The dust cloud parts and he turns off the radio report lifting his
CB receiver

BEN
Come in Foxtrot This is Echo Bravo
Mukurob speaking Come in Foxtrot

OCPL BOTES
Ben This is Johan Where are you man

BEN
On my way Where’s Lieutenant Beyman

OCPL BOTES
He’s in the house They’ve found a body
I think it’s the boys man

BEN
Bullshit Johan There are no more boys
This is a free country

BEN hangs up the receiver driving out of town now
Just past the roadhouse bar on the edge of the freeway he drives into another dust cloud

BEN
(Coughing)

Where does this dust come from ‘ey Watcher

He takes a battered cassette from his breast pocket and inserts it in the tape deck Whale song
distant and serene filling the car

CUT TO
30 EXTERIOR DAY THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

The driveway is a tangle of heavy vehicles and flashing lights

By the time BEN gets there the fire brigade are already packing up even though the air is still
thick with drifting smoke BEN pulls up next to the patrol car where LIEUTENANT BEYMAN
is standing trying to explain something to his radio

LNT BEYMAN
No sir Id say it’s far too early to even consider it
We should simply proceed with the investigation
as a local incident until we see what evidence arises
(He glances up as BEN climbs out of the Iandrover)
OlIn fact have my best man on the scene now
Yes Sir Thank you Sir lI get back to you

BEN
Hell of a way to start the day

LNT BEYMAN
Fucking nightmare The whole place has been gutted
House is full of body parts Looks like it’s been hit
by a commando unit Ben I think we’ve got ourselves
a bunch of terrorists

BEN
The victim was white

LNT BEYMAN
Probably Hard to tell from what’s left The house
was owned by the Haarhoff family I don’t know where
the kids are Grown up and gone away Mr Haarhoff
works as a site foreman for a copper mine in
Namaqualand We’re trying to reach him there

BEN
And Mrs Haarhoff

LNT BEYMAN
My bet is that’s her in the house She lived alone
out here Worked mornings in the “Liewe Heksie”
creche in town I had a kid in her class So far
no-one’s seen her this morning

BEN pauses to light a cigarette and then heads towards the house

CUT TO
31 INTERIOR DAY THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

The burned out bedroom is filled with cops and flashing police cameras

BEN moves slowly through the thinning smoke the sound of whale song still echoing in his
head

Most of the ceiling is missing causing fierce bars of sunlight to cut through the smoke and BEN
has to go carefully

In some places the floor has fallen away making passage difficult

He approaches the skeletal remains of a table and the charred object that rests on it
Thankfully the drifting smoke prevents us from getting a clear view

Just past the table CORPORAL DUTOIT is busy trying to photograph a steaming rectangular
mess of twisted springs

Only the uprights of the bedposts remain identifiable

Some of the corpse’s charred remains are still recognisable too But not many

BEN sees the charred murals now still visible in some places the blood baked black leant a
finishing touch by the fire

He reaches out touching the outline of the man that has been scorched into the plaster a
shadow of unease crossing his face

CUT TO
32 EXTERIOR DAY THE TELEPHONE BOOTH

WENDY stands in a ‘phone booth at the edge of a trailer park her Volkswagen parked nearby
Her eyes are closed again her head nodding impatiently as the ‘phone rings on the other end
Then someone answers

WENDY
Hullo Chas

ANSWERING MACHINE
This is the Jenkins house Chas Jenny and
Justina are away until Tuesday Please leave
your name and number after the tone Thank you

WENDY listens to the recording for a while without responding
She hovers in the booth as if not sure what to do next her eyes a little lost

After a while she walks over to the car and eases herself back into the driving seat She lights a
cigarette then opening the glove compartment she unfolds a tattered road map Her finger traces
the line of the N7 that runs all the way up to the Orange river and beyond that the B1 that
plunges onwards across the desert to the sea

A day’s drive
32 EXTERIOR DAY THE TELEPHONE BOOTH

She folds the map flicking the butt of the cigarette from the car window She reaches back into
the glove compartment exchanging the map for a pair of dark glasses She smiles at her
reflection in the rear view mirror taking note of how much better she looks now that her black
eye is hidden from view

She twists the mirror back into its correct position and turns the key in the ignition

CUT TO
33 EXTERIOR DAY THE GREAT NAMIB

SAARTJIE HAARHOFF’s car lying upside down at the bottom of a gulley a Country and
Western ballad still playing on its radio three local cops in light khaki summer uniforms
scrambling down the slope towards it

BEN is still standing up on the ridge next to his landrover WATCHER waiting obediently
beside him He checks the car’s license plate through his binoculars then scans up and down the
gully

Nothing

A river of shale and dry scrub

CPL BOTES
(Calling up from the gulley)
Should I turn the radio off

BEN nods and BOTES leans into the car through an open side window
Silence falls abruptly over the scene

BEN
How much battery life would that
thing have if it was left playing

CPL BOTES
Don’t know for sure I guess about
twelve hours Shall I have it checked

BEN nods curtly eyes scanning the horizon

Still nothing

He props a cigarette in his mouth cradling his hands for a moment to get a light and
looking down sees the butt of another cigarette lying at his feet

He picks it up bolding it delicately noticing that it has been rolled by hand
He crushes the end of the butt between his fingertips
The tobacco is not yet brittle

He slips the butt into a polythene bag and files it in his breast pocket glancing up finding a
faint trail of boot prints
The prints lead over the crest into the open desert
33 EXTERIOR DAY THE GREAT NAMIB

This morning the sun would have been at the killer’s back but it is already afternoon and the
glare is angled directly into BEN’s eyes

A gust of wind comes up lifting a fine curtain of dust around him and the prints begin to
fade

WATCHER begins to bark as the dunescape beyond the ridge suddenly comes to life
Ghosts of sand rising running everywhere dancing across the flatlands mimicking life

CUT TO
34 EXTERIOR DAY THE RAILWAY LINE

The wind picks up the footprints carries the dust across the dune sea and hurls it against the
side of a troop train pelting against the boxcar where HITCH is sitting sharing some of his good
rolling tobacco with a couple of soldiers

SOLDIER 1
The things I’ve seen man The things
I’ve seen you wouldn’t believe
(He takes a drag)
You been in the war man

HITCH doesn’t reply
His eyes are distant focused on the flatlands streaking past the boxcar

HITCH
How far’s this train going
SOLDIER 1
All the way to the sea man
SOLDIER 2
White sand blue water all those chicks
HITCH
What’s the next stop
SOLDIER 1
Bethany
HITCH

Anyone ever get off there

SOLDIER 1
No Train tanks up for water
No-one gets off
34 EXTERIOR DAY THE RAILWAY LINE

SOLDIER 2
People get on in Bethany man
but no-one gets off
(He laughs)

HITCH turns his attention to the flatlands streaking past outside the boxcar

HITCH
Sounds good

His eyes are on the distance now
The wind
The fleeting blue horizon

CUT TO
35 EXTERIOR DAY THE FREEWAY

WENDY slows the car as the sandstorm gusts across the freeway buffeting the side of the
Volkswagen

For the first time she feels the day’s events beginning to take their toll

She feels the need to stop and collect her thoughts Maybe coming to the desert wasn’t such a
good idea She glances up to see a passing roadsign marking out the turn-off to a small town
Some place called Bethany

The signpost is riddled with bullet holes

CUT TO
36 EXTERIOR DAY BETHANY RAILWAY STATION

The wind carries the sound of the train whistle into the station before the train arrives so that by

the time it pulls into the platform the soldiers and cattle waiting for it are already impatient to
board

A black kid wearing a patched conductor’s uniform is sitting on a chair propped against the
ticket office wall his shadow looking like it’s been painted into place His name is AARON He
sees HITCH pass and greets him

AARON
“Middag meneer

HITCH
(Touching his hat)
“Middag
36 EXTERIOR DAY BETHANY RAILWAY STATION
HITCH steps off the platform and stares down the road towards the town

After going a few hundred yards he glances back to make sure AARON isn’t watching him
then satisfied he hurries on

CUT TO
37 EXTERIOR DAY THE ROADHOUSE

There’s an old country dance number playing on the juke box when WENDY pulls into the
roadhouse’s parking lot

She hears it first as she gets out of the car rubbing her eyes after the long drive The only other
vehicles in the lot are a white camper an olive station wagon with caravan in tow and an
articulated cattletruck whose smell causes her to wrinkle her nose as she walks by

The cattle are lowing miserably in the heat

CUT TO
38 INTERIOR DAY THE ROADHOUSE

HENDRYK WAPENAAR the proprietor is behind the counter fixing a beer when WENDY
drifts in

CUSTOMER
(To HENDRYK)
80 I says fuck it we’re going to see the canyons
this year Kids get an education and it’s a damn
sight cheaper than the Wild Coast

HENDRYK isn’t really listening
His attention is on WENDY

HENDRYK
Can I help

WENDY
Do you have a washroom

HENDRYK
On the left Second door It’s no
great shakes or anything

WENDY

(Nodding)
Thanks
38 INTERIOR DAY THE ROADHOUSE
HENDRYK watches her go
She’s beautiful not through with being young yet
He wonders if she has children
CUSTOMER
(Playing with his new Zippo lighter)

So tell me do you guys still pick up

diamonds around here
CUT TO
39 INTERIOR DAY THE WASHROOM
WENDY’s black eye is looking better and the swelling in her lip has gone down
She splashes water on her face trying to wash away the dust
A truck engine starts up outside and the mirror trembles
CUT TO
40 INTERIOR DAY THE ROADHOUSE

WENDY emerges from the washroom and crosses to the payphone lifting the receiver to make
a call

WENDY
Hullo operator I’d like to make a
collect call
HITCH is crouched over the pinball machine behind her He puts in his change glances up at
her before beginning his game
CUT TO
41 INTERIOR DAY THE ROBINSON HOUSE
The telephone answering machine whirrs into life amidst the wreckage of the devastated lounge
OPERATOR’S VOICE

Hullo will you accept the charges on
a call from Bethany South West Africa
41 INTERIOR DAY THE ROBINSON HOUSE

WENDY’S VOICE
Wendy and Mark are out right now
If you want to leave a message
please speak after the tone

We track through the wreckage past an empty bottle up onto MARK who is sprawled
unconscious on the sofa

The answering machine bleeps and starts to record

OPERATOR’S VOICE
Hullo Bethany operator Hullo
I’m sorry there’s no-one answering

WENDY’S VOICE
Thank you It’s alright

The line goes dead

CUT TO
42 INTERIOR DAY THE ROADHOUSE

WENDY hangs up in a way relieved that there was no response

In the background the pinball machine rattles noisily

She glances up to see that HITCH has disappeared and a cat has taken his place crouching
on the glass of the pinball machine trying to catch the ball

WENDY lifts her handbag and walks over to the counter

WENDY
Can I have a coffee

HENDRYK
Coming up

He starts to fix the coffee but can’t resist satisfying his curiosity
HENDRYK
Are you a tourist I was wondering if

you were from abroad

WENDY isn’t paying him attention though
She’s busy leafing through the postcards on the rack next to the counter
42 INTERIOR DAY THE ROADHOUSE

WENDY selects a card and places it on the counter

WENDY
How much for this one

HENDRYK
Eighty-nine cents

He bends over to take a look at the card

CUT TO
43 DAY INTERIOR THE ROADHOUSE A LITTLE LATER

Two bored looking goldfish turning underwater We track off the aquarium onto
WENDY sitting sipping her coffee at a table next to the roadhouse window
She contemplates the card for a moment and then begins to write

We hear her voice on the soundtrack

WENDY’S VOICE
Dear Mark I’m going away for a while
to get my head straight

HITCH walks past outside the window
He’s talking to a middle-aged woman as if trying to get a lift
WENDY glances up at him for a moment before continuing writing

WENDY’S VOICE
I think it is best for both of us if we
don’t see each other again until we have
thought this over

Something distracts her and she glances up once more this time to see the white camper pulling
out of the parking lot

HITCH seems to have disappeared

WENDY sits for a while finding it hard to think the sight of the hitchhiker somehow making
her feel lonelier

CUT TO
44 EXTERIOR DAY THE PARKING LOT

WENDY walks back out to the car and clambers in
She sticks the unmailed postcard on the dashboard

WENDY’S VOICE
You are a good man and I do not want
to hurt you anymore nor do I want to
see you hurting yourself

She turns the key in the ignition and drives away heading back towards the freeway and the
open desert

CUT TO
45 EXTERIOR DUSK THE GREAT NAMIB

Just outside town WENDY pulls the Volkswagen into a lay-by at the top of a hill and gets
out to admire the view

The wind is still now and the whole world is filled with the glow of sunset

She sits on the bonnet and finishes writing the postcard watching the sun go down

WENDY’S VOICE
I just can’t love you anymore or be the
wife you want but it’s not your fault
It’s just the way things are I hope you
understand and don’t blame yourself or
do anything silly Be kind to yourself - Wendy

She pauses thinking and sees the rim of the sun touch the horizon sees the vastness of sky and
sand turned to fire

She bends once more to add a final line

WENDY’S VOICE
PS - Sorry about the cat
CUT TO
46 EXTERIOR DUSK THE OVERHANG
JOE sits on a rock watching the light die
His hands are busying themselves with peeling a large root

His eyes are very serious
The knife blade flashes in his hands catching the last gleam of the sunset

CUT TO
47 INTERIOR NIGHT THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

The beam of JOE’s flashlight lances through the dark flickering across the murals

The abstract shapes are even more frightening in the half light

The bushman holds the smoking root aloft in one hand leaving a streamer of acrid smoke
in the air

There is something moving in the darkness here

Something alive

JOE hears it and turns his torch beam searching

There

Another movement

Some kind of bird sitting in a gap in the eaves

The flashlight beam catches the inscrutable yellow eyes of a hunting owl glowing now
like pools of molten gold

JOE raises his hand to show that he has come in peace and for the first time we notice that he is
missing the last joint of his little finger
He smiles

CUT TO
48 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE ROAD

Twisters of sand coil across the freeway In WENDY’s headlights they seem alive and she
swerves the car to avoid them

She is on the edge of exhaustion already hallucinating coming down with a bad case of
highway hypnosis

he rubs her eyes trying to stay awake
hen just around the next bend she sees something moving in the road
his time it can’t just be the sand

She’s sure she sees a man standing on the white line coat fluttering all around him but his eyes
are like headlights now and his head seems long and snouted like a dog She yells waking up
from the trance as the car skids off the road

She hits the brakes and the Volkswagen screeches to a halt against a barbed wire fence on the
edge of an irrigation ditch

She falls forward against the wheel and begins to cry the dust settling around her

CUT TO
49 INTERIOR NIGHT THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

JOE dancing weaving a web of smoke with the burning root
CUT TO

50 INTERIOR NIGHT BEN’S BEDROOM

BEN moans aloud turning in his sleep the sheets twisted around him hot and sticky with
sweat the room trembling with the vibration of shunting trains

CUT TO

51 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE MARTIALLING YARDS

Sparks fly in the night dancing beneath the wheels of the cattletrucks

CUT TO

52 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

We see the figure of a man outlined by drifting sparks that flow in tidal volcanic bursts across a
pitch black sky

A dark man drawing closer now worn down bootheels tapping against the tarmac something
glistening in his hand

CUT TO

53 INTERIOR NIGHT BEN’S BEDROOM

BEN struggling in his sleep trying to wake

CUT TO
54 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT
The dark man holds out the knife its blade glinting flashing outlined by the seething sparks

Somewhere from far off comes the screech of train wheels

CUT TO
55 INTERIOR NIGHT BEN’S BEDROOM

BEN turns relaxing now sighing as the dream grips him
He whispers something in his sleep
A name

BEN
Katie

The photograph of the Nama woman and her child trembles on the mantelpiece

56 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

The night wind stirs in the washing line

The sheets billowing taking on the semblance of life

The sound of the wind is like a whisper a promise in the dark
A lovers sigh

CUT TO
57 EXTERIOR DAWN THE DESERT

Night ebbs slowly away taking its dreams with it the first light of day falling slowly through
the cracked glass of the Volkswagen’s passenger window finding WENDY asleep awkwardly
draped across the front seats

She wakes now stretching herself feeling the stiffness in her legs

She unlocks the door and clambers from the car not a little surprised by the barren
landscape she emerges into

She walks down the embankment into the wasteland savouring the clear light the crisp
early morning air

She’s looking for a place to piss but there’s no cover

In the end she gives up and just squats in the open feeling suddenly very vulnerable crouching
in this alien land with her knickers around her ankles

There is a distant rumble Like thunder but very far away

She stands hurriedly straightening her clothing and for the first time sees the Camper parked
nearby half hidden behind a thorn bush at the side of the road

The vehicle seems familiar to her and then she remembers it from the roadhouse and strolls over
to it hoping to get some help in getting HAMISH back on the road The vehicle seems very
quiet

She takes a step closer a little nervous now
57 EXTERIOR DAWN THE DESERT

WENDY
Hullo Is there anyone there
Is anyone awake

She tries to peep through the camper’s window but its curtains are drawn
Gathering her courage she knocks on the camper’s door

Again there is no reply

She puts her hand on the door handle and is about to open it when there is a sudden movement
behind her

A FARMHAND has appeared from nowhere and is trying to tell her something in an
incomprehensible local dialect

WENDY
God You frightened me is there anyone
else awake I need help my car
The FARMHAND responds once more in his own language his tone insistent
WENDY
No ’m sorry I don’t understand you
CUT TO
58 INTERIOR DAY THE CAMPER
We see WENDY through one of the camper’s windows as she starts to back away A fly crawls
on the glass droning loudly
CUT TO

59 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT

She starts back towards the Volkswagen the FARMHAND following her When she reaches
the car she glances back at him

WENDY
Will you help me

She motions as if pushing the car
WENDY

You have to push so I can get back
on the road Do you understand
59 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT

He stares at her blankly
She shrugs and clambers into the car
When she turns the key in the ignition the engine chugs feebly turns over and dies again

She repeats the procedure and the car suddenly begins to move starting with a lurch up the soft
shoulder

She glances back and sees that the FARMHAND has decided to push her after all She gives
him a thumbs-up but she’s not sure if he sees it or understands it

The car hits the freeway and the engine purrs into life

The FARMHAND starts to stroll up to her window but before he gets there she flattens her foot
on the accelerator and skids away

The FARMHAND watches her go then bends to touch the black streak of rubber she’s left
behind on the tarmac

He shakes his head

CUT TO
60 INTERIOR DAY THE VOLKSWAGEN

WENDY slows down a little easing into the road once more She feels safer now but the sense
of apprehension that has grown inside her still refuses to go away She tries not to think about it
knowing it is a thread attached to a greater blacker fear that she can’t deal with at the moment
She feels more alone now than at any time since leaving MARK

A shape appears in the distance distracting her from her thoughts
A figure standing on the side of the road up ahead
A white man wearing a grubby coat and hat

She recognises him as the hitchhiker from the roadhouse the day before He raises his hand and
she slows the car catching a glimpse of his smile as she coasts past him

He bends to shoulder his pack and then hurries over holding his hat on as if frightened it might
blow away WENDY winds down her window so she can get a good look at him hoping he’s
not a serviceman

WENDY
Where are you heading for

HITCH
(Grinning)
Nowhere

WENDY
Just came from there Anyplace
else I’m good for Climb aboard

HITCH bops around the front of the car and climbs into the passenger seat heaving his pack
into the back of the car
60 INTERIOR DAY THE VOLKSWAGEN

HITCH
Don’t know how to thank you My boots
were taking a beating out there

WENDY
I saw you at the roadhouse yesterday
Figured we were on the same road and
I could see you needed a ride

HITCH
If only everyone thought that way It’s unreal You only
get but one car every couple of hours and usually “vroom”
they just breeze by No one cares
(He looks about himself at the Volkswagen)
You’ve got a good car ma’m I like it

WENDY
The name’s Wendy

HITCH
Pleased to meet you ma’m

WENDY
Are you a serviceman or something

HITCH
I’m a tourist

WENDY
Are you from the States You’ve
got a strange accent

HITCH
I travel a lot Grew up on the road
Only place I feel at home

WENDY
Where was it you were heading to

HITCH
I didn’t say I don’t know Never been here
before Thought I’d see the desert though
It’s the oldest desert on Earth the Namib
you know that

WENDY
No No I didn’t
60 INTERIOR DAY THE VOLKSWAGEN

HITCH
The Sahara the Gobi Sinai Atacama all that
they all used to be rainforest one time but this
place this has always been desert like God
cursed it or something

WENDY
That’s neat How’d you know that

HITCH
They found fossils I read it in a book

WENDY
Just the way you said it 1 don’t know
(She shrugs)
Don’t listen to me I’m weird
Just yell when you want to get out

HITCH
Why How far are you going

WENDY
Straight through Ali the way to the sea

HITCH
You running from something

WENDY
What do you mean

HITCH
Just looked like you were running from
something is all Like the cops were after
you and you’d committed a murder or something

WENDY
(Laughing)
No I wish

HITCH
You want to talk about it

WENDY
Not yet

HITCH
It’s okay We’ve got nothing but time
60 INTERIOR DAY THE VOLKSWAGEN

There’s something reassuring in his voice

WENDY glances at him but the sun is on his side of the car now and the light dazzles her
She looks away catching only a fleeting impression of his eyes as he raises a polaroid
camera and snaps her picture

CUT TO
61 EXTERIOR DAY THE ROADSIDE

CORPORAL BOTES and DUTOIT pull open the back door of the camper then reel backwards
as a blast of flies and hot air greets them carrying with it the warm slightly sweet smell of
drying blood and gastric juices

BOTES turns his back staggering visibly his hands clutching at his stomach Beside him the
FARMHAND who led them there turns away not wanting to watch DUTOIT takes a deep
breath hearing the faint sound of a digital watch chirruping somewhere inside the camper
drawing his eyes back slowly towards the woman’s carcass

Behind him he hears BOTES retch violently

DUTOIT
Johan go get the pathologist on the radio
Tell him we’ve got something here man

There is a curious expression in DUTOIT’s blue eyes as he leans slowly forward into the
camper and picks up the blood streaked wristwatch

CUT TO

62 INTERIOR DAY THE MORTUARY

The main doors open with a slam and DR LEIDZINGER the pathologist breezes down the
mortuary aisle his clipboard tucked under one arm BEN following him at a measured pace

glancing at the rows of corpses on either side of him trying to ignore the sound of the bone saw
drifting in from the laboratory next door
61 INTERIOR DAY THE MORTUARY

LEIDZINGER
Let’s see now Bullet wound Bullet wound Burning
Ah here’s our girl We’ve got just about everything on
her Massive tissue loss severing of limbs and major
arteries evisceration partial cremation sexual mutilation
possibly even cannibalism You’ll appreciate we’ve had
difficulty pinpointing the exact time and cause of death
We found a clock wedged up her snatch for God’s sake

BEN
Was it still working

LEIDZINGER
No He had to take it apart to fit it all in

LEIDZINGER sighs and BEN steps forward to get a better view of the catafalque

The body parts seem curiously inhuman the harsh light lending their disarray a sense of
horrid surrealism

LEIDZINGER glances at BEN the light glinting for a moment in his bifocals

LEIDZINGER
He must have used a whole bunch of instruments
to do this the wounds suggest a carving knife and
a razor at least then of course there’s the mirror
shards the bastard even used his teeth though
fortunately for her most of the wounding only
occurred after death

BEN
What’s your theory on actual cause
Off the record

LEIDZINGER
She wasn’t tied down it’s hard to tell but there
don’t seem to be any ligature marks on the limbs
I’d say she may have been strangled first her
neck’s dislocated and the spinal cord’s severed
between the Atlas and Axial vertebrae that almost
certainly happened before he took her head off
we know that much God knows Maybe she let him
do it to her

BEN
Did he fuck her

LEIDZINGER
If he did he didn’t come No sperm
traces
62 INTERIOR DAY THE MORTUARY

BEN
He could have been wearing a
contraceptive

LEIDZINGER
Safe sex It’s a possibility
I don’t know if there’s any way
I can check that

BEN
You got any hairs saliva
anything at all

LEIDZINGER
Fire took care of all that We’ll probably
be able to get you a cast of the suspect’s
dental pattern but that’s about all we’re
going to be able to glean from the corpus
delicti itself The really interesting stuffs
in the scrapings we took from the mural but
we’re going to need specialist help if we’re
gong to get any further with them

LEIDZINGER pulls off his rubber gloves so that he can spread a series of murky looking
photographs on the autopsy bench
BEN bends over them realising that he is looking at enlarged detail shots of the mural

BEN
Go ahead What am I meant to be
looking at

LEIDZINGER
As you might expect the majority of
the stuffs painted with blood but he’s
used other materials to bring out some
of those colours We found traces of iron
oxide and haematite He achieved the
whites and the lighter shades by mixing
the victim’s fat with kaolin and seagull guano

BEN
The man’s an artist alright

LEIDZINGER
It’s just a shame he doesn’t enjoy finger painting
He didn’t leave us a single print
63 INTERIOR DAY THE MORTUARY

BEN
Can’t we trace the pigments Place
them geographically so we can get
an idea of his movements The
birdshit for instance he must have
gone to the beach

LEIDZINGER
We can try but you might have a better
chance trying to chase it’s cultural roots
This stuff’s all closely related to witchcraft

BEN
Are you serious

LEIDZINGER
Perfectly Human body parts all have
their uses in ritual magic A sangoma
could tell from the missing pieces what
our man was after That’s obviously
why he chose the new moon

BEN
Do you believe in magic Dr Leidzinger

LEIDZINGER
It depends how you mean it
Certainly I believe in witchcraft

BEN
Yeah but do you believe in magic

LEIDZINGER
You mean magic as in conjuring demons
shapeshifting raising the dead all that
I don’t think such things are possible
sergeant Do you

BEN
This is the 20th century doctor I don’t
believe in magic either and if you had I
doubt I would have believed anything else
you said

Suddenly the swing door behind them slams open startling both of them A young morgue
ATTENDANT pokes his head into the room
61 INTERIOR DAY THE MORTUARY

ATTENDANT
Sergeant Mukurob Bethany station’s
on the ‘phone They say it’s urgent

BEN
(To LEIDZINGER)
Can you hold on a minute

LEIDZINGER

No hurry
She’s not going anywhere

BEN offers LEIDZINGER a grim smile then follows the attendant out through the swing
doors

LEIDZINGER stands in silence for a moment

Then he glances around at the row of corpses

LEIDZINGER
How about you guys Do any of you guys
believe in magic Come on Clap your
hands if you do

He stands for a moment listening to the silence then the sound of the bonesaw starts up again
in the next room

LEIDZINGER
Bunch of cynics

He strolls away down the aisle shaking his head
Just before he reaches the door he does a curious little tap dance laughing to himself
He exits and the door swings shut with a slam behind him

63 EXTERIOR DAY THE GREAT NAMIB

WENDY and HITCH are strolling across a very flat landscape
HITCH is swigging from a bottle trying to provide a sympathetic ear to WENDY who is
obviously in the middle of explaining something

HITCH
Let me get this straight
You’re saying all this is because
he had dark hair and brown eyes
62 EXTERIOR DAY THE GREAT NAMIB

WENDY
It wasn’t just that The magic was gone There was
nothing left between us Every time he touched me
I felt scared I kept pulling back and Mark couldn’t
understand He always thought it was him That’s
the kind of ego he had He thought I must have been
in love with someone else he kept asking all those
questions and of course when he found out
about Chas it flipped him right out

HITCH
Chas had blue eyes right
Blonde hair and blue eyes

WENDY
Yeah Just like you Am I fucked
up or what

HITCH
Yeah You’re fucked up but then so’s
everyone else Have a drink

WENDY
Now I feel like a tramp

HITCH
Ima hitchhiker not a marriage counsellor
Go on Have a drink

WENDY
(Shaking her head)
I’ve gotta drive

HITCH
Then have an apple Keeps you healthy

HITCH makes a gesture with his hand seemingly plucking an apple from thin air He offers it
to WENDY

WENDY
How did you do that

HITCH
Magic
(He laughs)
It’s nothing Sleight of hand
Goes down a treat in the third world
I do card tricks too
63 EXTERIOR DAY THE GREAT NAMIB

WENDY
Show me something

HITCH
Later We’ve got time

WENDY takes the apple biting into it a little apprehensively at first

WENDY
It’s good Thanks

HITCH
So you came out here to try and figure things out

WENDY
Didn’t people always go to deserts when they wanted to
get in touch with themselves or whatever it is

HITCH
It’s true Moses saw a pillar of fire A pillar of fire
and a pillar of dust You sure you don’t want a drink

WENDY
I guess it can’t hurt Road’s so straight
you’d have to be crazy to fall off it

HITCH
You’re not crazy

WENDY
Who was it who saw the burning bush

HITCH
That was Moses too He had dark hair and
brown eyes

WENDY
(Sighing)
It wasn’t just the eyes I told you He hugged too
tight Always Like he was frightened or something
Like he didn’t have enough love when he was a child
I felt sorry for him but in the end he sucked all the love
right out of me In the end I started to started to

HITCH
You started to think he was the same as the
rapist Same hair Same eyes
64 EXTERIOR DAY THE GREAT NAMIB

WENDY
How did you know

HITCH
I can see the mark
You must have been very young for it
to leave a mark like that

WENDY
Thirteen I was just a kid

HITCH
Was it a friend
Someone you knew

WENDY
Yeah A friend

HITCH
It’s always worse when it’s someone you know

WENDY
I’m not hungry anymore

WENDY tosses the apple away and turns back towards the car

HITCH stands in silence for a moment then he reaches into his breast pocket to produce a
battered mouth organ striking up a tune which is at first absurdly mournful and then
increasingly lively and mischievous as he begins to follow WENDY back towards the road
the half empty bottle riding in his coat pocket

64 INTERIOR DAY THE ROBINSON HOUSE

MARK sits crosslegged in the middle of the lounge consulting a map wreckage strewn out all

around him

His shirt is unbuttoned and we can see the small handgun he keeps tucked in his belt

The answering machine resting beside him is busy replaying its message once more
OPERATOR’S VOICE

Hullo Bethany operator Hullo
I’m sorry there’s no-one answering
64 INTERIOR DAY THE ROBINSON HOUSE

WENDY’S VOICE
Thank you It’s alright

Then there is only the sound of the distant pinball machine and the click of the ‘phone being put
down followed by a purr of white noise

MARK automatically reaches out to rewind the tape his eyes fixed at a name on the map

A town called Bethany

CUT TO
65 EXTERIOR DAY BETHANY STATION

The day is beginning to cool now and signs of life are returning to the sunbaked platforms
A goods train idles beside the water tower filling its tanks for the long journey to the coast
The sounds are so familiar that AARON no longer notices them

He leans back in his chair his mind riding a boxcar a thousand miles away eyes watching the
rails through halfclosed lids

A shadow slants across the platform and then the shape of a man steps between him and the sun
He tilts up the peak of his cap squinting into the light

BEN
I’m looking for Joe

AARON
I don’t know What Joe What do you mean

BEN
Joe Niemand Bushman Joe
Brown man yay big
(he indicates with his hand)

AARON
Jammer konstabel I know who you mean
now but he hasn’t been around here haven’t
seen him around since spring he’s probably
out on the desert Got some old doedie
down in Namaqualand I bet
65 EXTERIOR DAY BETHANY STATION

BEN
Take me to him Aaron else I’ll just go
through your pockets and bust your ass
for everything you got You want that

AARON
(Shaking his head)
Tssuuu Station master wouldn’t like it

BEN
(Nodding towards the station entrance)
The car’s out front
CUT TO

66 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DRIVE-IN

The Star of Bethany drive-in cinema has been closed now for a number of years The screen is
sun warped sagging from neglect boards peeling away to reveal patches of evening sky
Beneath the screen in the sea of asphalt waves and rusting speaker poles stands the figure of a
man in a ragged coat a stick in his hand his eyes turned towards the sunset

JOE NIEMAND watching the sun go down

A dog barks in the distance and JOE turns to see WATCHER loping towards him across the top
of the mound AARON and BEN MUKUROB following ala distance

AARON
Lhad to bring him Joe I’m sorry
I didn’t have no options

JOE
No harm done The sergeant had to come

BEN
Your remember me then Joe

JOE
You were the one who never feared me
It’s a shame you did not come sooner

BEN
I’ve been busy

JOE
You’ve missed some good shows
There’s a big show out here every night

BEN
I need your help Joe There’s very little time
66 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DRIVE-IN

JOE
You want to know about your future
I can’t tell you about that

BEN
No I can guess the future

JOE
Then it’s the end of things you’ ll want to
hear about I’ve been talking to him Ben
and he said the end was coming up real soon
He’s going to end the world by fire this time
The Earths gonna dry up and crack

BEN
I haven’t come about fairytales Joe
I’ve come for facts
(He hands Joe a sheath of photographs)
We found her yesterday The other one
was found this morning We’re still trying
to trace the vehicle

JOE
(Nodding his head)
Tsuui I thought as much
This is real bad stuff Togati
Death magic

BEN
How much do you know about it
Can you tell by the signs who did this

JOE
You can always tell a magician by his work
A heart for bravery and strength a liver for
health money and healing eyes for seeing through

BEN
Tell me about the fingers What do the
missing fingers mean

JOE
Fingers are power Fingers are always power Soul
power catches in knots in knuckles in such If you
want to win a war you better get yourself a whole
fist full of knuckles so you can make drum magic
conjure fire in the blood know what I mean
So many things you can do with fingers
66 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DRIVE-IN

BEN
What happened to your fingers Joe
Did someone steal your power too

JOE

(Holding up maimed hand)
A good sharp rock did this
Once I was blind with pride but now it will be
easier for me to get to Too’ gah when it’s my time
If I hadn’t made obeyance Kaang would’ve been
mad at me and I would’ve had to travel to Too’ gah
on my head and they would’ve given me only flies
for food It’s a long way to Too’ gah and my head
would have got sore

BEN
Not many people go to Too’ gah at all these
days Joe If you know the man who did this
you must tell me

JOE
This is not the work of my people I’ll have
to ask around Can I keep these

BEN
If you think itll help but be careful who you
show them to or itll cause trouble

JOE
They will be safe with me

BEN
Then you know where to find me

JOE
You tread carefully now There isn’t
anyone who’s safe from this kind of stuff
Not even a big man like you That’s why it’s
togati You’ve always got to keep your eyes
open when you deal with magic

BEN
Yeah I know There’s magic all around us right

JOE
(Smiling)
You bet All around us Ben
66 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DRIVE-IN

BEN turns away walking back towards his car WATCHER following at his heels He glances back
only once he’s reached the gap in the drive-in fence and then he sees that JOE is still watching him
AARON hunched beside him whispering something in his ear

CUT TO

67 EXTERIOR DUSK THE ROAD

The sky is like burnished bronze just beginning to glow red at its rim The sun is already dipping
out of sight but WENDY tries to hold it on the skyline driving relentlessly west as if to escape the
night

HITCH slouches in the passenger seat the brim of his hat dipping a little as his head slumps slowly
forward

RADIO
near the South African border after the
discovery of two bodies and reports of arson
from Bethany district in Namaland

WENDY nudges HITCH and his head lolls slackly

WENDY
(Muttering to herself)
Fine company you are How’d you like it
if I fell asleep as well

RADIO
The police named one of the victims as Saartjie
Haarhoff a teacher from the local nursery school

She winces and turns the radio to another channel
She shakes HITCH again beginning to feel a little worried

WENDY
Hey Hey Hitch Wake up

WENDY
Hitch

RADIO PREACHER
Destructive storms and evil winds are they
They are mighty children heralds of the
baneful storm forerunners of pestilence
67 EXTERIOR DUSK THE ROAD

The PREACHER’s voice sounds strangely slurred as if something is wrong with the transmission
WENDY doesn’t want to listen to it but she’s keeping HITCH propped up with one hand now and
has to keep her other hand firmly on the wheel

Something appears now on the roadside up ahead

The figure of a man A hitchhiker He raises his thumb

WENDY shakes HITCH again and he slumps against the far door

WENDY
Hey Wake up Wake up What is this

She begins to slow the car the figure of the hitchhiker gliding closer

PREACHER
They are the flood which rusheth through the land
Their joy is our sorrow Their merriment our grief

WENDY leans forward narrowing her eyes against the setting sun Silhouetted against the glare
the figure of the hitchhiker looks more and more like HITCH He even seems to be wearing a very
similar hat and coat The figure’s face seems to be obscured possibly by some kind of scarf The
angle of the light makes it impossible to be sure Suddenly HITCH starts forward beside her with a
yell

HITCH
Don’t stop

HITCH puts his foot down over hers crushing the accelerator to the floor and the car shoots
forward with a jolt

WENDY
Hey Let go What’s wrong with you

HITCH
Nothing Nothing I’m sorry I was half asleep

There is a moment’s silence WENDY glances back but the figure of the hitchhiker is no longer in
sight She begins to relax and for the first time notices that the radio too seems to have changed
stations replacing the PREACHER’s sermon with a saccharine country and western tune She rubs
her eyes

WENDY
You really freaked me out back there

HITCH
I’m sorry I guess I just don’t care for hitchhikers

WENDY
Now that makes a hell of a lot of sense
67 EXTERIOR DUSK THE ROAD

She shakes her head more than a little confused and looking ahead catches sight of an approaching
signpost marking the turn-off for a motel She slows flipping on the indicator

HITCH
What are you doing

WENDY
Unless we stop now next time you fall asleep
you might just never wake up

CUT TO
68 EXTERIOR DUSK THE MOTEL

As the Volkswagen turns off the freeway and begins to rattle down the dirt track to the motel a gust
of wind comes up drawing a glowing veil of dust across the circle of concrete cabins
WENDY pulls up as close to the reception office as she can

WENDY
(To HITCH)
Stay here I’ll see if I can find anyone

A gust of wind strikes her as she steps from the car door
She hurries up onto the concrete verandah rubbing dust from her eyes and pushes open the door of
the office

CUT TO
69 INTERIOR DUSK THE RECEPTION OF THE CANYON MOTEL

The room smells of disinfectant A nightmare of yellowing wallpaper and tasteless watercolours
WENDY has to ring the bell on the counter at least three times to raise the greying ghost of a
CLERK

WENDY
Id like a room

The CLERK peers at her myopically for a moment before fumbling in his pocket to find his glasses

WENDY
I’ve got identification Passport
Driver’s licence Credit cards
Itll just be for one night

CLERK
You can slow down I’ll have to get
the register
69 INTERIOR DUSK THE RECEPTION OF THE CANYON MOTEL

WENDY
Sorry

CLERK
(Dusting off a heavy book he removes
from below the counter)
We don’t take credit cards

WENDY
T’ll pay cash

CLERK
Sign there And here
on the line

WENDY concentrates on the register while the CLERK flips desultorily through her passport

CLERK
Travelling alone

WENDY
No Oh no I’m sorry There’s two of us

CLERK
Youll be wanting a double room then
Best I can offer you are twin beds

WENDY glances up at him

CLERK
It’s okay You can push ‘em together It’s no sweat

CUT TO
70 EXTERIOR DUSK THE MOTEL

The wind is still whistling furiously around the building as WENDY steps out of the office
clutching the keys

Almost at once she knows that something is wrong
She steps towards the Volkswagen raising an arm to shield her eyes from the wind

WENDY
Hitch
70 EXTERIOR DUSK THE MOTEL

The Volkswagen is empty

Both HITCH and his pack are gone

She glances around but there is only the wind surrounding her and the restless dust and the dying
sun

She begins to shiver wrapping her arms about herself trying to shut out a cold that is inside her

CUT TO
71 INTERIOR DUSK BETHANY STATION

BEN is striding through the station in an obviously bad temper closely followed by his
white subordinate KONSTABEL DUTOIT

DUTOIT
She’s a city girl late twenties or early thirties

BEN
What did you do to him Wynand

DUTOIT
She drives a red Volkswagen with city plates
Should be piss easy to pull in

BEN
What did you do to him for God’s sake

DUTOIT
So me and Johann got heavy with him so what
We’ve got something to go on now

BEN slams open the door leading to the station’s cells trying not to look at DUTOIT

BEN
He would have talked to me

DUTOIT
So where were you all day
How come you didn’t respond to your radio
We even sent someone around to your house

BEN pauses in front of one of the cells
The FARMHAND crouched in the comer glances nervously up at them
71 INTERIOR DUSK BETHANY STATION

BEN
Release him

DUTOIT
He’s a material witness

BEN
I don’t care Release him

LNT BEYMAN
Let him go Konstabel Sergeant Mukurob
is still your superior

BEN looks around to see BEYMAN standing in the doorway watching them DUTOIT stiffens to
attention

DUTOIT
Yes sir

LNT BEYMAN
I want you and Botes in my office tomorrow morning
with a full report What you’ve done here has cost us
this man’s testimony Do you understand that

DUTOIT
Yes sir

LNT BEYMAN
Ben I want a word

BEYMAN’s tone softens as he sees the look in BEN’s eyes
LNT BEYMAN
Come on I’ll get you a drink

BEYMAN exits and BEN follows
Just before ducking through the door he pauses to glance at the identikit picture

DUTOIT
We did the right thing didn’t we

BEN folds up the picture and puts it in his pocket without comment

CUT TO
72 INTERIOR NIGHT THE ROADHOUSE

BEN and LNT BEYMAN sit at one end of the bar counter while HENDRYK serves them The
roadhouse is almost empty tonight but BEN still feels uneasy

BEN
I shouldn’t be here

LNT BEYMAN
Nonsense It’s a free country
It’s no problem is it Hendryk

HENDRYK
No problem so long as the old lady doesn’t see
she’s a little old fashioned

BEN
Do you know whales mate for life

LNT BEYMAN
Never heard that Ben

HENDRYK
(Giving them their change)
Yeah I heard sharks never sleep though
If they stop moving they suffocate

BEN
It’s not true They just sleep in strong currents
That way the water flows over their gills and they
keep breathing They got photographs of it

LNT BEYMAN
You like the sea Ben

BEN
I grew up in this place I’ve never seen a whale in my life

LNT BEYMAN
I’m going to see them Ben There sending me home

BEN
T heard

LNT BEYMAN
They offered me two years pay
What else could I do

BEN
You did the right thing
72 INTERIOR NIGHT THE ROADHOUSE

The pinball machine rattles loudly behind them and BEN turns to see that two men in greasy
overalis are busy unplugging it

BEN
What’s happening to the pinball machine

HENDRYK
It’s being moved I’m letting the beer hall have it

LNT BEYMAN
Why don’t you get out Ben You’re only a few
years off retirement You could use the time

BEN
What would I do instead

LNT BEYMAN
I don’t know It’s your life You have to make yourself a
life We were all sad about Jake but it’s been years
and Katie of course did you ever hear from her

BEN is trying not to listen keeping his attention fixed on the girl’s identikit the pinball table
jingling behind him as the men carry it out into the parking lot

BEN
No Not a word

LNT BEYMAN
I’m sorry I’d always hoped

BEN studies the photograph and for a moment it is almost as if he is close to remembering
something important

BEN
Maybe I will go away

LNT BEYMAN
Where will you go to

BEN
Where everyone else is going

LNT BEYMAN
You deserve the rest You should look after yourself If you go
on the way you do without eating you’ll give yourself bad dreams

BEN
What makes you think I don’t have dreams already
72 INTERIOR NIGHT THE ROADHOUSE

LNT BEYMAN
I just don’t see you getting anywhere Not here
Not with this case
(He puts a large paper envelope on the counter)
Leidzinger turned in his report but it’s snake-eyes
All the blood and tissue samples belonged to the victim

BEN
We don’t have the facts

LNT BEYMAN
What facts

BEN
Id like to see all the files on similar unsolved
murders in the past not just from this area but
from all over the country from across the border
from South Africa Botswana Zimbabwe as well
he must have done this before somewhere
he’s experienced

LNT BEYMAN
I can put in a request to Pretoria before I go but
I’m not sure you’ll get any joy the best I can
offer you is anything that’s on file in the archives
here even that’ll be like trying to find a needle
in a haystack

BEN
Or a diamond in the sand

BEN sighs his gaze returning once more to the identikit portrait of WENDY that rests on the
counter before him

BEN
We’ve lost him but he’ll do it again Trust me

LNT BEYMAN
We’re meant to stop him before he does Ben

BEN
We may not have to find him

He may find us

BEN gazes into the strange woman’s eyes and it is as if he sees something familiar there

CUT TO
73 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

The photographs of SAARTIJIE and the other women are laid out in a triangle in the dust
WENDY’s photograph at their apex firelight glinting on the hunting knife that lies beside them
HITCH reaches out pressing his knuckles to the ground beside the photograph When he withdraws
his hand it leaves something very much like a pawprint in the dust

CUT TO
74 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

We are prowling through the dimly lit room past the contents of WENDY’s handbag scattered
across the bed past the postcard she wrote to MARK following a trail of discarded clothes to the
bathroom door

The door is ajar the sound of running water coming from inside

WENDY is sitting in the bathtub steam rising ali around her a razor in one hand The blade
trembles as it touches her wrist

CUT TO
75 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MORGUE

The doors open with a slam but the fluorescents don’t go on

BEN stands staring in disbelief for a moment at the sea of flickering candles spread across
the slabs

LEIDZINGER steps up to him holding a clipboard

LEIDZINGER
I’m sorry There’s been a powercut

BEN
That’s alright

He steps forward into the room seeing a small knot of figures dressed in their Sunday best
standing around a slab at its far end The walls of the morgue have been redecorated now in one
huge mural and BEN strains his eyes to take in details of it knowing it is important to the case

LEIDZINGER
This is embarrassing for everyone
We were trying to find you all day

BEN
I’m sorry

BEN walks slowly down the aisle towards the group of figures recognizing them now as
his parents and in-laws KATIE standing amidst them dressed in black

She has been crying but now there is only anger in her face

BEN reaches out to her
75 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MORGUE

BEN
Katie

KATIE
This is your fault It’s because of you and

your stupid ideas that it’s come to this

BEN looks down at the slab and sees that he is standing over the body of his only son
JOE NIEMAND is leaning over the slab and as BEN watches the bushman cuts off JAKE’s fingers
with a carving knife

CUT TO

76 INTERIOR NIGHT BEN’S BEDROOM

BEN comes awake gasping for breath sitting up suddenly in bed in the middle of the night

He shakes his head forcing the dream away from himself eyes turned towards the window and the
moonlight on the glass

Then from somewhere far out in the flatlands he hears a train blow its horn like some tremendous
beast howling in the night

CUT TO

77 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

We are flying with the night wind flying with the train as it hauls its chain of cattle tracks across
the endless dark hurtling towards the red band of light forming in the east and a dawn that scarcely
promises to come

DISSOLVE THROUGH

The first rush of light

The yellow light

A band of golden cloud

DISSOLVE TO

78 INTERIOR DAWN THE MOTEL ROOM

WENDY is already awake watching the new light blazing in the curtains the sheet hugged

protectively against herself
The wind stirs the curtain beckoning her into the new day

CUT TO
79 EXTERIOR DAY THE MOTEL

The motel room door closes with a soft snick behind her and she heads for the car She’s feeling
easier now singing something under her breath She reaches for the Volkswagen’s door handle and
then pauses the song dying inside her Through the window she can see someone curled like a
corpse in the well of the car HITCH not moving more like a mannequin than a man She hesitates
for a moment before suddenly snatching the door open and reaching down as if to shake him But
he is awake He turns quickly and takes her hand by the wrist drawing her into the car and pulling
himself up into the passenger seat When she’s sitting comfortably behind the wheel he releases her

WENDY
Well good morning

HITCH
I’m sorry I’m a light sleeper

WENDY
Why the hell did you sleep here I could have paid
for you at the motel if you’d told me

HITCH
Force of habit Did you sleep well

WENDY
What happened to you last night

HITCH
The call of nature I had to dash I’m sorry

WENDY looks unconvinced

HITCH
We should be going now You don’t want to waste
time if you want to reach the sea

WENDY
What makes you so sure I still want to give you a ride

HITCH
It’s your decision

WENDY looks at him for a moment not sure whether she should be angry or not HITCH smiles at
her

WENDY
I’m going to regret this

She turns the key in the ignition

CUT TO
80 EXTERIOR DAY THE FREEWAY

The Volkswagen is batting along under full steam the rock song on the radio turned up loud enough
to make conversation unnecessary

WENDY is bopping along with the music when she notices the dark cloud on the horizon For a
moment she thinks it might be a storm coming and then she sees that its darkness is too thick too
black

She brakes rapidly almost coming to a halt in the middle of the road

WENDY
What the fuck is that

She turns off the radio and for a moment they both sit staring at the road ahead in silence The
smoke is rising from the remains of what seems to be a burning car standing in the middle of the
freeway Several vehicles are parked further along and the road is blocked off by a cordon of
policemen

HITCH
Drive closer It’ll be alright

WENDY eases the car closer to the wreck and one of the policemen steps forward waving them
onto a detour They leave the freeway running parallel for a moment with the scene of the car
accident

HITCH
Whoee That’s a real good one

WENDY
I’m sure no-one got out of that

HITCH
Yeah Look at the colours in those flames

WENDY speeds up realising that she’s driving on a dirt trail that seems to be leading directly away
from the freeway Ahead the road disappears into a flat seemingly limitless landscape out of
prehistory

WENDY
What the hell is this

HITCH
It’s a detour

The road is so indistinct here that it appears as if they are driving over open desert The Volkswagen
plunges valiantly on trailing a column of dust that is soon the only way to mark it in the infinite

flatness

CUT TO
81 EXTERIOR DAY A BACKSTREET IN BETHANY

There is a light wind gusting down the narrow road as BEN pulls his landrover to a halt opposite
LNT BEYMAN’s home MRS BEYMAN and the kids are battling against the wind outside the
house trying to tie something to the roof of a station wagon

BEN strolls across the road towards MRS BEYMAN who sees him coming

MRS BEYMAN
KORNELIUS Your man is here

LNT BEYMAN emerges from in front of the car’s raised bonnet oil stains on his hands

BEYMAN
Ben Glad you made it I’d almost given up on you

BEN
I was at the funeral

BEYMAN
Come on We’d better go into the house

MRS BEYMAN
Kornelius You said you were ready

BEYMAN
You wait in the car This won’t take a moment

BEYMAN guides BEN towards the front door

CUT TO
82 INTERIOR DAY THE BEYMAN HOUSE

BEN crouches beside the commissioner in the middle of the empty lounge as BEYMAN
produces a collection of dog-eared files from an incongruous looking carrier bag

BEYMAN
I brought everything I could find

BEN
I didn’t expect so many

BEYMAN rummages through the files withdrawing the photograph of yet another lost woman

BEN
Christ This is from 1952
82 INTERIOR DAY THE BEYMAN HOUSE

BEYMAN
They go all the way back to the war All women I’ve even
found one from 1928 Some hooker who got stabbed to death
at Klein Karib station They found a pocket watch in her mouth

BEN
But that couldn’t have been him that was before he was born

BEYMAN
Did you ever wonder how many murderers are struck by lightning
every year How many die in car accidents or other acts of God

BEN shakes his head

BEYMAN
A great many probably It’d make an interesting
statistic wouldn’t you think

BEN doesn’t reply busying himself instead with trying to count the files
He hears the car hooting outside

BEYMAN
That’s Pam I’d better not keep her waiting

BEN
No I suppose not

BEYMAN produces a ring of keys from his pocket

BEYMAN
Here Be a good man and hand these back up to the office
(He puts the keys on the floor beside the files)
One’s the key to the house and the other’s a key to
the station gun locker

BEYMAN winks at him
BEN looks puzzled

BEN
I don’t understand

BEYMAN
That’s all I can do You have to look after
yourself now Ben

BEN
I saw Mr Haarhoff’s eyes at the funeral
He didn’t love her Nobody loved her
82 INTERIOR DAY THE BEYMAN HOUSE

BEYMAN
Yes Ben You’ll remember to lock up the house won’t you

BEN
Yes Sir

BEYMAN steps out into the wind once more He glances back one last time

BEYMAN
Look after yourself Ben Try to eat a little better

Then he is gone the door closing behind him and BEN is left alone crouched in an empty room
holding the typed details of a great many dead people in his hands

CUT TO
83 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT
We are flying once more with the wind following the Volkswagen as it bounces across the flatland

WENDY
I can’t get a thing on the radio Not a damn thing

HITCH
It doesn’t matter

WENDY
What do you mean it doesn’t matter We’ve got less
than half a tank left We could be anywhere

HITCH
But we’re exactly where we’re meant to be Look

WENDY
Oh my God

Up ahead the flatlands come to an abrupt end falling away into thin air at a point where the sky
finally meets the land

HITCH
You’ve done it girl You’ve made it all the way to the edge of the world

WENDY pulls the car to an abrupt halt and a cloud of dust envelops them She pulls open the door
shielding her face with one arm and runs towards the edge still not believing it

WENDY
Oh my God this is amazing
83 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT

HITCH strolls slowly over to her where she stands staring out into the heat hazed distance the sun
glinting on the silver coil of a river far below her in the midst of a landscape as barren as the moons
of Mars a landscape hundreds of feet below them on the floor of a canyon that stretches as far as
eyes can see like a great rift in the fabric of the world

HITCH
This is the home of the great snake father Kouteign Kouroo lord of all waters
In the dawn of things he made this place from the lashing of his coils

WENDY
It’s amazing All this time all this time I was coming here

HITCH
You were brought here

WENDY
The road’s part of the snake too isn’t it

HITCH
You’re catching on

WENDY
And you Who the hell are you I don’t even know your proper name

HITCH
And I don’t know your surname

WENDY
You’re part of it aren’t you Part of this

HITCH’s expression hardens suddenly becoming too serious
He starts to say something but WENDY reaches out to him

WENDY
Don’t talk Don’t spoil it
HITCH pulls away from her

WENDY
No Don’t

HITCH
You don’t understand

WENDY
Sssh

She reaches out again softly touching his face touching his lips as if to seal them
Slowly she takes him in her arms
83 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT

HITCH
But

WENDY
This was meant to be as well

She draws him forward and kisses him on the lips and he opens to her now his arms enfolding her
She is borne up by him surrendering herself to his grasp and for a moment they are just like any
other pair of lovers Two people on the edge of infinity holding on to each other for dear life

CUT TO

84 INTERIOR DAY BEN’S BEDROOM

BEN sits cross-legged in the middle of the room whale song turned up loud on the tapedeck to try
and drown out the sound of the trains the photographs of the dead girls spread all around him and a
half bottle of vodka at his side

He has a shotgun cradled across his lap and is working rhythmically on its barrel with a hacksaw
while WATCHER looks on eagerly as if knowing what is to come

CUT TO

85 EXTERIOR DAY THE ROAD BLOCK

A PATROLMAN stands at the roadside flipping through a South African passport belonging to a
city registered car that’s just been flagged down

PATROLMAN
Where did you say you were heading for

MARK
Bethany I’m visiting an in-law

Afterwards the PATROLMAN will recall the strange almost frightened expression he sees in the
driver’s eyes as he waves him on

CUT TO

86 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DESERT

The sky is gold again
The dust cloud behind the Volkswagen is like a column of fire

WENDY
We’re not going to get much further We’re running on empty
86 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DESERT

HITCH
It’s not far Look

WENDY looks up and sees that the figure of the hitchhiker has appeared at the roadside up ahead
the sun at his back once more almost at the same angle as it was the previous evening

WENDY
How did he get all the way out here

HITCH
Just drive past We’re closer to the freeway than you think
Don’t look back

WENDY
(Glancing at the hitchhiker as they pass him)
He’s got your hat and coat

HITCH
I said don’t look back

WENDY
Why What would happen if I did

HITCH doesn’t reply so WENDY glances into the rear view mirror
The hitchhiker is somewhere behind them now but she can’t see him in the haze of dust
The Volkswagen’s engine suddenly sputters and cuts out and they coast to a halt

WENDY
Oh great Couldn’t I have been turned into a pillar of salt instead

HITCH
It’s alright We’re here

WENDY opens her door and climbs slowly from the car staring in disbelief

WENDY
I’m dreaming I must be dreaming

The car has come to a halt just in front of the Canyon Motel which they seem to have been
approaching from another angle as the freeway that they started on that morning now lies a few
hundred yards in front of them on the other side of the motel buildings

HITCH climbs out of the car and stands beside her grinning

HITCH
Or maybe someone is dreaming you

CUT TO
87 EXTERIOR DUSK THE MOTEL VERANDAH

WENDY and HITCH sit at a table watching the sun going down listening to the radio playing in
the reception office

RADIO
The Namibian tourist board announced today that the finger
of God has fallen The landmark rock formation one of the area’s largest
tourist attractions collapsed last night during a high wind Dated by
geologists as being at least four million years old the formation was
given its name by bushmen hunters who felt it resembled a massive
finger pointing towards the earth

The CLERK apparently the only member of the motel’s staff appears bringing them their drinks

CLERK
I hope everything is alright with you folks
I’ll change the channel if you want to dance

WENDY
Well be fine thanks

HITCH is preoccupied with counting his change He glances up as the clerk shuffles back to the
reception office

HITCH
I’m not sure how much to tip him Maybe I
should leave him something foreign

WENDY
Let’s see

HITCH
I’ve got all kinds This one’s from Morocco That’s from Ethiopia

WENDY
What this little one It looks old

HITCH
It is It came out of the earth at Baalbek in the Bekaa
valley not 400 metres from the enclosure where they
kept the hostages It’s the old site of the temple of Baal
Hezbollah territory now Strange they should hold an
envoy of the church in such a place

WENDY
I thought Westerners couldn’t go there

HITCH
It depends who you know It’s all friends and friends of friends
87 EXTERIOR DUSK THE MOTEL VERANDAH

WENDY
Who are you

HITCH
Just a travelling man I try to keep moving

There is a sudden burst of sparks in the night somewhere far out over the flatlands
The sound of a muffled explosion reaches them a moment later
WENDY gets up crossing to the edge of the verandah to get a better view

WENDY
What the hell was that

HITCH puts down his beer bottle and crosses to her side eyes towards the night There is another
series of reports and what seems to be a swarm of red fireflies rise from the horizon to greet the
stars

HITCH
Looks like tracer fire long way off probably

just some soldier getting bored screwing around

In the background the CLERK finally changes the radio channel tuning over from the news
programme to a Country and Western channel HITCH grins hands in his pockets

HITCH
Do you want to dance

He circles WENDY moving to the music in a curious dance of his own
WENDY starts to laugh but then he takes her hand drawing her to him

Unseen by either of them HITCH’s empty beer bottle shivers on the table behind them and then
with a screech begins to slide across the tabletop

There is another explosion in the distance but this time WENDY and HITCH pay no attention

CUT TO

88 INTERIOR NIGHT THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

Firelight floods once more across the charred murals

BEN stands at the base of the stairs examining what appears to be a freshly painted sign
He feels he is close to the heart of the mystery

Then BOTES appears at the top of the stairway his face pale in the half-light

CPL BOTES
She’s up here Sir
88 INTERIOR NIGHT THE HAARHOFF HOUSE

BEN follows the line of candles that mark a safe path through the wreckage letting the lights guide
him upwards the charred steps creaking dangerously beneath him

CPL BOTES
She’s been waiting for you Sir
I’m afraid you’ll have to explain to her

He pushes open the bedroom door and BEN hears the sound of a woman sobbing The woman is
standing in the far comer of the room her back towards him her eyes turned to the diagrammatic
figure in the mural The sound of her sobbing is louder now and as BEN approaches her he sees she
is wearing a black mourning dress

He pauses behind her suddenly afraid
He tries to speak but can only manage a dry whisper

BEN
Saartjie

She turns slowly and he sees her face and the tears that streak her cheeks pale as wax Her eyes are
so dark Like the depths of space

BEN
I’m so sorry I did everything I could

She reaches out to him and BEN feels the urge to step back but finds himself unable to His boots
seem glued to the floor Her arms encircle him and it is as if BEN hears distant dance music now
coming from somewhere in the night

Her face swims before him and he sees now that her tears have become drops of blood
dark riverlets trickling from her eyes BEN gasps trying to draw air drowning in the darkness his
throat thick with dust Then her lips touch his and she sucks the breath right out of him

CUT TO

89 INTERIOR NIGHT BEN’S BEDROOM

BEN gasps trying to breathe as AARON shakes him out of the trance He rubs his eyes breathing
easier now seeing that he is still sitting cross-legged amongst the scattered photographs on his

bedroom floor

AARON is crouching before him absently petting WATCHER his expression serious beyond his
years

AARON
You must keep your eyes open and come with me
You are in danger

CUT TO
90 INTERIOR NIGHT THE BEER HALL

MARK frowns checking the address on the slip of paper as he follows the sound of the pinball
rnachine across the threshold into the smoke filled chaos within
The BARHAND glances nervously at him as if already expecting trouble

MARK
I’m looking for someone

BARHAND
Sorry

MARK
A woman who came in here Her name’s Wendy
Wendy Robinson

MARK holds out a photograph and the BARHAND takes it from him squinting at it in
suspicion It is the ROBINSON’s wedding photograph taken from the frame beside their bed
WENDY’s face ringed now in red crayon

The BARHAND shakes his head

BARHAND
Sorry I don’t know her

Two farmhands come wandering over to take a look and Mark shows them the photograph as well

MARK
Is this your telephone number

He shows the BARHAND the number he has written down on the scrap of paper

BARHAND
No I don’t know this number
No-one here has seen such a person

MARK tums to see that the FARMHANDS are passing around the wedding photograph One of the
men glances up at MARK and we recognise him now as the man who helped push WENDY’s car
and who later ran foul of the police

MARK walks slowly towards him pushing his way through the crowd

MARK
You You’ve seen her haven’t you

A MECHANIC wearing oil stained dungarees steps up behind him
He is the same man that HITCH saw working on the tractor two days before

MECHANIC
No-one here has seen anything
There is nothing for you here
90 INTERIOR NIGHT THE BEER HALL

MARK
You know where she is damn it
That’s the same pinball machine that I heard
on the telephone I know it

FARMHAND
Who are you

MARK
My name is Mark Robinson

I’m her husband

FARMHAND
You are a policeman I think

MARK
No I run a sports shop for God’s sake

FARMHAND
Then what for do you wear a uniform

The FARMHAND holds up the wedding photograph pointing at MARK’s figure

MARK
No I was in the army then I’m her husband damn it

The MECHANIC takes MARK’s arm bending it suddenly behind his back

FARMHAND
You are no-one’s husband now

The first blow takes MARK in the small of his back

CUT TO

91 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

They are alone now lost to the world lost to themselves mouths locked hungrily together hands
grasping at each other’s flesh

WENDY turns in his arms pulling free from the kiss HITCH’s lips hot now against her neck as
she reaches to unbutton her blouse

HITCH
Wendy

CUT TO
92 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE OVERHANG

BEN turns off his flashlight the firelight bright enough now for him to be able to make out the cave
walls and the paintings that cover them without its aid

He reaches out gently touching the closed spiral of infinity

The flames leap higher and a herd of painted eland rear up out of the mists of time shivering in the
firelight

Everywhere here the walls are filled with ancient life

Kudu and gazelle water buffalo and leaping springbok flee the corning of spindly spear wielding
ipthyphallic man

AARON beckons him on leading him deeper into the leaning rocks past the procession of animals
and hunters and into the firelight where JOE is waiting for him

JOE’s expression is solemn

He sits cross-legged beside the fire and when BEN sees the carved stick he holds in his hands he
feels the fears of his dream return to him once more

The old nameless fears of childhood

Behind JOE he sees a freshly painted design a painted labyrinth winding in upon itself that
resembles vety much the mural on the bedroom wall in the HAARHOFF house

WENDY cries out her voice high and strange like the cry of a wounded bird
HITCH closes his eyes his face contorted as if in pain

We glimpse the face of an antique clock as it is tom apart by an explosion our field of vision

95 INTERIOR NIGHT THE BEER HALL

MARK lies face down on the bar room floor the sound of sirens growing in the darkness He tries
painfully to lever himself up onto one elbow his other hand creeping slowly around to the small of
his back grasping for the butt of the handgun that is still tucked in his belt
95 INTERIOR NIGHT THE BEER HALL

Then suddenly he finds his hand grabbed by the wrist and twisted once more

He yells forced back to the floor spitting blood

He feels the barrel of the gun shoved hard against his head and he closes his eyes
The gun metal is very cold against his throbbing skull

BOTES
Any more moves and you’re meat Limey Got that

He twists MARK’s arm around once more so that WYNAND can snap the cuffs onto him Just
before MARK loses consciousness he hears the sound of his car’s tyres screeching on tarmac as the
vehicle roars out of the parking lot

CUT TO

96 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

WENDY and HITCH lie intertwined in the wet sheets their faces illuminated momentarily
by the headlights of a passing truck

HITCH is crying

WENDY places her hand on his forehead trying to comfort him

WENDY
It’s alright I’m here Don’t worry

HITCH
You don’t understand

WENDY
It’s okay Everything’s okay

HITCH
I’m so frightened it’s like I’m asleep and dreaming
It’s like a wind blowing through my head
I feel so lonely Like I’ve come to the edge of eternity
and beyond is nothing but darkness

WENDY runs her fingers gently down his body tracing the lines of waxy scar tissue that criss-cross
his torso

WENDY
What happened to you What did they do to you

HITCH
Don’t let go

He gently grasps her wrist returning her hand to his forehead
96 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

HITCH
Sometimes I get frightened that my head might
fly apart to let it all out into the world It sounds
so crazy

WENDY
Sshh It’s alright

HITCH
I’m sorry I want to love you but there’s no time

WENDY
Ssssh

She puts her hand gently over his eyes

97 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE OVERHANG

BEN sits beside the campfire listening to JOE speak the flames dancing in the old bushman’s eyes
In his hands he holds the photographs of SAARTJIE’s body

JOE
This is the work ofa Nagtloper
A black magician a shapeshifter

BEN
Shapeshifter

AARON
The body’s the physical projection of the soul Ben
Change the mind Change the body It’s all a fucking
joke This whole place you understand

JOE
These troubled times have drawn the Nagtloper
out of the deep desert Ben He smelled Bethany
dying and came for souls to build his power
He feeds off our pain

BEN
No He’s flesh and blood like us he must be

AARON
You can’t hunt him like an ordinary skellim Ben
He is of the spirit
97 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE OVERHANG

JOE
They have been here since the first times and
they shall still walk the roads when we are dust
You cannot put an end to them any more than the
priests before you So long as we live in this
world so will they walk in our shadows

98 INTERIOR NIGHT THE SHOWER

HITCH stands in the tiled cubicle face turned towards the shower head eyes closed his
features calm once more

Slowly he turns looking back now through the rising steam towards the bedroom door
His eyes are as expressionless as stone

JOE (Voice over)
Their world is more complete than ours
their souls more pure their purpose more absolute

99 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

WENDY turns restlessly in the bed waiting for HITCH’s return listening to the sound of the
shower coming through the bathroom door and the plumbing groaning and knocking in the wall

CUT TO

100 INTERIOR NIGHT THE SHOWER

HITCH steps slowly from the cubicle steam curling around him

He looks slowly towards the mirror half-knowing what he must see

There is a man watching him from the mirror

Where his reflection should be stands instead the reflection of the hitchhiker caught up
with him at last still swathed in HITCH’s scarf and travelling coat

The hitchhiker’s eyes are very ancient set deep in shrivelled sockets

Behind the figure there is only darkness and firelight flickering on distant cave walls The bathroom
is nowhere to be seen

HITCH feels himself drawn like a marionette towards the mirror

Now he sees the mural its colours glowing in the darkness and he knows what he must do

The figure raises its gloved hands towards the glass and he sees that it is holding out a clay bowl to
him

Its fingers where they show through the ragged gloves are little more than bones
100 INTERIOR NIGHT THE SHOWER

HITCH reaches slowly forward to take the bowl but his hand comes up short pressed against the
solid surface of the bathroom mirror

CUT TO

101 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

WENDY sits up in her bed touching her fingertips together
There is blood on her hand

She clambers slowly from the bed to retrieve her handbag
She searches inside the bag frowning as she withdraws at a postcard She glances at it for a moment
before realising that it is the card she wrote to MARK

From the bathroom she hears the sound of HITCH turning off the shower
She drops the card fumbling now for the box of tampons only to find it empty She curses and
glancing up notices HITCH’s rucksack lying open beside her

She looks back to the bathroom door once again before unable to resist herself she leans over to
peek into the rucksack

Her eyes light upon a small wooden box and she reaches for it lifting it out from where it is
partially hidden beneath a spare shirt

She glances back one last time to make sure HITCH is still in the bathroom before undoing the
clasp and lifting the box’s lid

Inside arranged on black jeweller’s felt are a neat row of severed fingers each one with its own
wedding ring and painted nail

CUT TO

102 INTERIOR NIGHT BETHANY STATION

MARK throws himself at the cell door his hands clutching at the bars yelling at the top of his
voice his face a mask of blood

MARK

CUT TO
103 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE OVERHANG

JOE lifts the carved stick so the firelight falls across the markings he has made in it They seem to
be a form of writing but in no language that BEN has ever seen before

JOE
There is one way and one way only to stop a Nagtloper
The Nagtloper must always keep moving but if he can be
tricked into stepping over this kierie he will be rooted to
the spot and unable to call upon his power The stick
will bind him and when you burn this root it will drive
away his shadow

JOE presses the stick and a root rubbed in fat into BEN’s hands
He takes them nervously

JOE
You must go now
Death hunts you just as you hunt the dust devil

BEN rises and AARON stands too taking BEN’s hand and pressing something into his palm

AARON
Take this as well It is my gift to you

BEN opens his hand to see that he holds an animal’s claw tied to a leather thong

AARON
It is a leopard’s claw It will bring you luck in the hunt

Just then JOE begins to sing the words rising from him in an ancient tongue as he places the
photographs of SAARTJIE’s body on the fire
The flames leap suddenly higher sending shards of orange light glancing out across the rock face

CUT TO

104 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

SAARTIJIE’s face stares back at WENDY from the polaroid photograph She looks forlorn
Somehow hopeless Frozen forever on her windswept verandah WENDY’s face is here too
captured behind the Volkswagen’s wheel but she flips quickly past herself leafing through a dozen
other polaroids All women

She shivers and reaches to put the polaroids away but then her eyes light on an ominous looking
bundle at the bottom of the bag She is just reaching down to unwrap it when HITCH appears
behind her in the doorway

HITCH
DON’T TOUCH THAT
104 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

WENDY recoils dropping the bundle which falls open spilling an array of shining surgical
instruments across the motel room carpet

WENDY inches back the polaroids slipping from her hands between a groan and a whimper
escaping from her lips

Amongst the instruments she can see a straight razor and a series of paint brushes made from bones
and human hair

WENDY
Why Why for God’s sake

HITCH
Why what

WENDY
Why did you kill them All those women

HITCH
It was an accident This whole damn thing
Swear to God Wendy I wasn’t meant to be here
Like those fucking angels God cast into hell
They couldn’t help becoming devils They had
no choice see

He advances slowly towards her and she backs away realising that he is between her and the door

HITCH
I was somewhere else before Something else
Like a cloud or a dream just drifting through creation
incarnate but surrounded by vacuum It’s all light
All of it In dying their light has become part of me
so I can keep travelling keep going on up until
I transcend this fucking world and become what
I’m meant to be

WENDY
Oh Jesus Hitch you’re out of your fucking mind
Can’t you see that

The side of the bed nudges against the back of her knees and she sits down shaking her head her
eyes glazing over with fear and disbelief

HITCH
No You’re the one who doesn’t understand
They were dead already I saved them I gave
them purpose by making them part of my purpose

WENDY
Oh God I feel sick
104 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

HITCH
It’s alright Wendy Don’t you see It’s perfect in fact
Glowing Fucking crystalline The whole damn thing
It’s so easy Getting off a train someplace where no-one
knows me finding someone who needs me using them
then getting back on the road and no-one is any wiser
nobody knows me nobody cares

HITCH picks up a cigarette popping it in his mouth before realising that he is still naked and
doesn’t have a light WENDY doesn’t volunteer one

WENDY
Why me What about me for Gods sake

HITCH
(Tucking the cigarette behind his ear)
Because you’re running on empty and only I can
help you I can set you free

WENDY is no longer watching him She inches back onto the bed breathing deeply her eyes
squeezed shut As if from a great distance she hears the slap of rubber against flesh as HITCH pulls
on a pair of surgical gloves She leans back against the pillow shivering Her eyelids flicker and she
catches a glint of light as HITCH lifts a hunting knife from the floor

HITCH
Death was always inside of us I’m just a mid-wife
All I have to do is make a small incision to let it out

He kneels beside her

Caressing her

The gleam of the blade crosses her eyes

Once

Twice

And again

Guiding her down the well of oblivion

HITCH’s voice coming to her now in the darkness
Soft as a whisper

HITCH
Death was once a mirror made of ice It fell from the sky and flew
into a thousand pieces and the pieces lay in the long grass until dogs
came and rolled in the grass and the mirror stuck to their fur and
when children played with the dogs it stuck to their fingers and when
they ate it went inside them and went into our souls

The blade touches her
Following the contours of her body until its tip is poised above her heart
She sighs and at the last she is at peace the road unravelling behind her eyes
104 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

HITCH
I’m letting it out Wendy I’m going to let it all out Help me
Breathe deep now Breathe deep and we’ll be together always

He raises the knife his arm coiling slowly back like a cobra preparing to strike
And the ghost of a smile touches WENDY’s tired features
Like a blessing

HITCH
I love you Wendy

He closes his eyes
And her hand snakes out and grasps the marble stand of the bedside light swinging it with all her
strength screaming at the top of her lungs

WENDY
GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME

The square comer of the lightstand takes HITCH in the side of his head

The knife flies from his hand and he topples sideways moaning blood jetting in a geyser from his
forehead She pulls herself from under him grabbing the lightstand with both hands now and
bringing it down hard on the back of his head

WENDY
YOU MURDERING FREAK

She takes a step back letting the lightstand fall from her hands Its base is clotted with blood and
bits of hair She shakes her head making a sound that is halfway between a whimper and a laugh
Her foot touches the fallen knife and she snatches it up holding it protectively in front of her A
slight quiver runs through HITCH’s body but otherwise he is silent

There is blood everywhere She slowly lowers the knife wiping HITCH’s blood from her lips
There is blood all over her She wipes off as much of it as she can before pulling a new dress over
her head and kicking on her shoes

She picks up her handbag and car keys and then heads for the door As she reaches the threshold she
hears HITCH groan behind her His voice thick and syrupy with blood

HITCH
Wendy

She turns to see HITCH stirring on the mattress trying to rise She fumbles with the key in the lock
her hands shaking so badly that it seems to take forever to get the door open HITCH drags himself
over to the edge of the bed loses his balance and falls heavily to the floor his head striking the
carpet with a loud clump

WENDY
DAMN YOU LEAVE ME ALONE
104 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM
She backs out onto the verandah seeing the Volkswagen waiting in the parking lot behind her

HITCH
You don’t understand I love you

HITCH gets to his knees and as WENDY makes a dash for the verandah he lunges drunkenly after
her legs WENDY slams the door on his head and he groans his hands clutching at her ankles

WENDY
STAY DEAD DAMN YOU

She slams the door on him again and one of the hinges cracks

CUT TO
105 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE CANYON MOTEL

A light comes on in the reception office and WENDY lets go of the door handle staggering back
against the verandah railing

CLERK
Hey What’ going on out there

WENDY
SUFFERING SHIT

HITCH
Wendy

WENDY
YOU PICKED THE WRONG GIRL YOU FUCK

She kicks HITCH in the side of the head before turning in a half-stumble heading for the car the
motel CLERK shouting after her

CLERK
Hey Hey What’s happening

She fumbles with the Volkswagen keys getting the door open at last and flinging herself into the
driver’s seat It is only when she already has the key turned in the ignition that she remembers that
she is out of gas
WENDY
Oh Christ Sweet suffering Christ

She turns the key again and the engine shudders turns over once then dies on her There is a
sudden slap and she looks up to see HITCH pressing his hands against her window leaving
bloodstains on the glass
105 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE CANYON MOTEL

HITCH
Wendy I’m sorry Come back Well talk it over

He reaches for the door but it is already locked

WENDY
Stay the fuck away from me

She tries the ignition again and this time the engine roars into life

HITCH
WENDY

She rams her foot down hard on the accelerator and the Volkswagen pulls away with a jolt HITCH
lashes out at the door as she pulls past him and she catches a brief glimpse of his twisted face the
blood covering him like a bizarre skin painting

There is something subtly different about him now but there is not enough time for her to be able to
make sure His face seems snoutier his eyes brighter his ears pointier his ears thicker and all
raggedy like the fur of a dog

HITCH
I LOVE YOU WENDY

She twists the wheel guiding the car onto the dirt track leading to the freeway and HITCH runs
after her head down panting like an animal The engine sputters threatening to give out on her at
any moment and she grits her teeth Gradually HITCH’s running naked figure falls behind her and
she begins to feel something resembling relief

HITCH comes slowly to a halt standing in the middle of the dirt track dust settling around him
breathing easily now He touches the gash in his forehead and grins his teeth filled with blood

CUT TO

106 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE FREEWAY

WENDY gets as far as the freeway feels the Volkswagen’s wheels bounce off gravel onto tarmac
and glances around one last time the engine whining ominously

HITCH raises his hand as if to wave to her but instead he makes a curious gesture in the air And
the wheel twists suddenly in her hands as if yanked by an unforeseen force She tugs frantically at
it trying to get the car back into its lane but the engine chooses this precise moment to die on her
the car coasting under its own momentum across the white line

WENDY
Oh Jesus God No
106 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE FREEWAY

A harsh light bathes her face and looks up to see the headlights of a cattle truck bearing down on
her its horn blaring

WENDY
NO

She tugs at the frozen wheel but there is nothing she can do now In the last few seconds before the
impact her face seems deathly calm her arm rising slowly in front of her eyes in a vain attempt to
shield herself

The Volkswagen strikes the articulated vehicle head on in a spray of sparks and flying glass its
chassis crumpling borne along for a moment by the truck’s momentum threatening to be chewed
under by its careering bulk

WENDY is screaming but even she cannot hear her voice The car shakes her like a dog shaking a
rat She is flung forward her knees impacting against the dashboard and then an instant later she is
snapped back into her seat the safety belt cracking like a whip across her chest a stinging rain of
broken glass haloing around her

The cattle truck jack-knifes across the white line as its own momentum slows and the station wagon
that has been stuck behind it for the last few miles plunges head on into its side with its own
caravan still in tow The night is suddenly filled with shrapnel as the tow bar sheers away and the
caravan flips over tearing itself apart as it rolls across the embankment

This second impact hurls the Volkswagen clear onto the gravel verge where it rolls twice before
coming to a rest against the crash barrier The driver of the truck is not so fortunate He is driven
through the windscreen of his vehicle like a man fired from a circus cannon and is killed instantly
when he strikes the same crash barrier head first

Slowly the single unified beast that the cattle truck and the station wagon have become grinds to a
halt as if experiencing a moment of post-coital bliss Then the screams begin

The Afrikaans family in the station wagon all begin to yell at once the husband cursing
inarticulately at the top of his lungs his voice all but drowned out by the pitiful lowing of the
maimed cattle

In the steaming remains of the Volkswagen WENDY dangles sideways in her seat still held in by
the safety belt scarcely breathing now blood dripping thickly from a gash in her scalp

The driver of the station wagon is the first to regain his feet kicking open the car door and tumbling
out onto his knees on the asphalt

We recognise him now as the tourist who briefly crossed WENDY and HITCH’s path in the road
house He glances up hearing his children screaming in the back seat and his wife sobbing in the
front and sees the road ahead filling suddenly with frightened oxen their sides streaming with
blood stampeding from the wrecked tailgate of the truck

TOURIST
FOR FUCK’S SAKE
106 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE FREEWAY

He staggers to his feet to avoid being trodden under and sees a man walking towards him along the
white line He reels towards him shouting inarticulately desperately needing to blame someone for
what has happened He looks quite ridiculous in his short pants with his bare legs streaked with
blood

TOURIST
YOU’RE GOING TO PAY MAN
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT RIG COST ME
TWELVE HUNDRED BUCKS THAT FUCKING
RIG COST ME

The sound of his voice seems to cause his children to scream even louder
The approaching figure pauses looking at him in amusement
Through his daze the TOURIST sees now that the newcomer is not the driver of the truck after all

He stammers for a moment falling silent as he notices that the figure is stark naked his body given
the illusion of clothing by patches of dried blood

The man takes a crumpled cigarette from behind his ear props it in his mouth and then slaps his
hands against his hips as if searching for the pockets he doesn’t have He glances up at the tourist
grinning

HITCH
Do you have a light

The tourist takes a step backwards still stammering wordlessly
Behind him his wife is pulling the kids out of the car
They too have fallen silent their eyes rivetted on the naked man

TOURIST
I’m sorry

He takes his Zippo from his pocket and holds it out to HITCH his band shaking HITCH takes it
from him nodding his head

HITCH
Thanks

The TOURIST continues to back away until he reaches his wife and children the four of them
drawing back a little way as a group before turning and breaking into a hobbling run heading down
the freeway towards nowhere in particular

HITCH lights the cigarette watching them run watching the steam rising from the wreck and the
puddle of gasoline creeping across the freeway He can’t seem to stop smiling

WENDY comes awake inside the Volkswagen with a moan lying still for a moment unsure
whether she’s all there or not She twists awkwardly around in her seat broken glass falling from
her hair and manages to get one hand against the door trying to push it open
106 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE FREEWAY
HITCH spins the lighter’s flint eyeing the orange flame with satisfaction He takes a deep breath

WENDY tries the door again searching for the handle only to find that it has been shorn away in
the crash She puts her shoulder to the door and gives it a shove but her position in the seat is too
awkward for her to be able to apply any real force The door remains unyielding

HITCH takes a step backwards and tosses the lighter towards the wreck The movement is almost
casual The lighter strikes the asphalt sliding under the chassis of the truck

A moment later there is a soft whoompf of igniting gasoline and a ring of orange fire fans out from
beneath the wreckage

WENDY bears the sound and starts to panic scrabbling at the catch on her safety belt The flames
begin to take hold now climbing higher through the wreckage and the oxen panic stampeding
down the freeway HITCH encouraging them slapping their sides as they pass

HITCH
Yeeh-Hah Whee Doggy

There is a sudden flash as the station wagon’s gas tank explodes and a ball of flame climbs into the
night HITCH howls dancing from foot to foot on the white line

WENDY screams grabbing at the buckled window frame as the safety belt comes undone her legs
kicking for a moment before finding purchase against the passenger seat She pushes herself up and
forward scrambling through the window glass crystals cutting into the palms of her hands and
cascading back past her into the wreck

Outside the night is already white hot sucking the air out of her lungs She heaves herself clear of
the wreck as its chassis starts to burn landing awkwardly on the gravel verge wisps of flame
raining all around her

She drags herself to her feet forcing herself to run her bruised legs flaring with pain her blouse
already beginning to smoulder She swings one leg over the crash barrier and is just about to haul
herself over when the cattle truck explodes behind her

This second blast is even larger than the first sending a wave of fire washing out across the tarmac
engulfing both the Volkswagen and the remains of the caravan The shock wave lifts WENDY up
bowling her over the railing and down the embankment in a rush of hot air

She yells rolling in the dirt swatting at her hair to keep it from catching alight coming to rest at
last in a dry drainage ditch at the base of the freeway

The road is a river of fire now but still we can see the shape of a single leaping man silhouetted
against the inferno his bare feet dancing on the white line his eyes glowing as if they too are
ablaze

WENDY whimpers crawling for a while on her hands and knees trying to put some distance
between herself and the blaze
106 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE FREEWAY

When she is out of the immediate glare of the firelight she pulls herself to her feet and begins to
tun heading straight out into the open desert keeping the freeway at her back

HITCH pauses in his dance sniffing the air Then turning on his heels he howls like a dog and
goes loping off down the gravel driveway towards the motel

CUT TO

107 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE CANYON MOTEL
The motel CLERK sees him coming and crosses to the edge of the verandah to intercept him

CLERK
Hey Where do you think you’re going

HITCH barely slows in his stride grasping the clerk by the throat as he passes and lifting him up
over the verandah railing The CLERK has the eyes of a frightened rabbit

HITCH snaps his neck with a flick of his wrist and hurls the body away into the parking lot His
face is expressionless

CUT TO

108 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

WENDY ’s pace has slowed now as she becomes more aware of her new surroundings Her legs are
throbbing begging for rest her shoes uniquely unsuited for the rough terrain she finds herself
crossing

The light of the burning vehicles spurs her on denying her rest She knows it will only he a matter
of time before HITCH comes looking for her

She knows as well that he has a better command of the terrain but she hopes that if she can put
some distance between her and the freeway now she might stand a chance of finding a spot where

she can lie low until dawn

Already there is a reddish gleam growing along the horizon’s rim and she heads doggedly
towards it gritting her teeth

CUT TO
109 INTERIOR NIGHT THE MOTEL ROOM

HITCH pulls on his boots adjusting their leather straps before wrapping himself once more in his
travelling coat

He turns to the mirror dusting off the coat and straightening his hair
He even manages a smile

CUT TO

110 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE FREEWAY

HITCH skirts around the edge of the burning vehicles his figure backlit by the flames momentarily
becoming the apotheosis of all he stands for his coat fluttering in the fire wind his worn down
bootheels crunching over broken glass

The lurid glow of the flames no longer holds his interest now that the spirit of the hunt possesses
him He swings himself over the crash barrier skipping down an embankment towards the dry
drainage ditch

The firelight helps him now making it easy for him to pick up WENDY’s tracks She is going
heavy on one foot as if slightly lame heading due east into the dawn HITCH grins sniffing the air

He knows the land enough to know there’s nothing out there Nothing save him and WENDY and a
thousand miles of open desert

The sun is just beginning to rise and HITCH walks towards it whistling cheerfully as if looking
forward to the day ahead

111 INTERIOR DAWN BETHANY STATION

The light comes suddenly on in the cell and MARK sits up with a groan rubbing his head There is
a haggard looking policeman standing outside his cell a bandolier stuffed with shotgun cartridges
slung over one shoulder his shirt unbuttoned to reveal a string of dog tags and a dangling panther’s
claw around his neck

MARK tubs his eyes not sure if he is dreaming this bizarre individual or not The man holds out an
identikit photograph in one hand his eyes deadly serious

BEN
Is this your wife

CUT TO
112 EXTERIOR DAWN THE FREEWAY

It is almost full light now and although the fire has been extinguished the air is still filled with
drifting wisps of greasy ash The body of the truck driver has been covered with a blood-soaked
sheet its extremities marked out by lines of white tape

The wreckage-strewn tarmac is everywhere awash with blinking emergency lights and the air is
thick with the crackle of radio static The centrepiece of this spontaneous display of performance art
is the still-steaming wreck itself welded by the fire into a single unit of charred metal and fused ox
skeletons On the soundtrack we hear CORPORAL BOTES on the radio sending out an
unanswered call sign

CPL BOTES

113 INTERIOR DAWN THE MOTEL ROOM
BEN kicks the door open and goes into the room shotgun first MARK a little behind him
brandishing his own handgun keeping the doorway covered The room is of course empty

BEN gives it a cursory once over noting the fallen lightstand and the bloodstained sheets He sees a
postcard lying on the floor beside the open handbag and bends to pick it up reading a couple of
lines before glancing up at MARK

BEN
It’s for you

He hands him the card pushing out past him onto the verandah not wanting to look at him in the
eyes He leans against the railing watching flies gather on the motel clerk’s corpse hearing the
postcard rustle behind him as MARK sinks slowly to his knees on the bloodstained carpet

He hears MARK trying to suppress a sob and for an instant BEN feels a terrible urge to laugh

CUT TO

114 EXTERIOR DAY THE FREEWAY

BEN and MARK stand beside the parked landrover on the soft shoulder just upwind from the scene
of the wreck WATCHER sniffing the air expectantly as BEN surveys the horizon with a pair of
binoculars

BEN
That’s open desert out there all the way to the Fish River
Vulture city Without water or shelter I don’t rate anyone’s
chances in it It’ll be two hundred degrees or more by noon
114 EXTERIOR DAY THE FREEWAY

MARK
She’s out there walking

BEN
Then come on Let’s go get her

He turns climbing into the driver’s seat while WATCHER hops in through the passenger door
settling himself between him and MARK

He eases the landrover off the freeway following a dirt track for a while before turning off onto the
desert floor itself an uninterrupted horizon of rock and orange dust soaring ahead of them beneath a

terrifyingly empty sky

CUT TO

115 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT

WENDY is somewhere far out in the shimmering immensity scuffing her way across a seemingly
infinite expanse of cracked mud as lifeless as the floor of a dried up ocean Her limp is more
pronounced now her feet red and throbbing her shoes threatening to come apart at any moment
their seams already torn and chafing at her flesh She stumbles to a halt staring in a glazed off-
hand way at the seething sky

WENDY
I wanted to go to the seaside God not to the fucking beach

She starts to giggle and the giggle grows into a laugh She sits down rocking from side to side
leaning forward until her face is touching the dirt

The laughter slowly dries up inside her and she rolls over feeling the rocks hot against her
skin She turns her head and sees something moving in her field of vision Slowly she focuses on it

An albino scorpion scuttling from rock to rock in search of prey white as a snowflake against the
orange stone

116 EXTERIOR DAY A LOW HILLTOP TWO HUNDRED METRES NORTH

HITCH sits in the shade of the rocks as motionless as a lizard watching WENDY through the
dusty lenses of a pair of old military issue binoculars

He lowers the binoculars and lifts his harmonica striking up a comically funereal tune watching
the vultures circling on the high thermals overhead
117 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT
When WENDY regains consciousness she finds that three of the huge ragged-feathered birds have
already landed nearby and are sitting watching her shifting impatiently from one leg to another

WENDY struggles back onto her feet cursing at them

WENDY
I’M NOT DEAD YET

She kicks one of the birds out of her way and staggers on towards the shimmering skyline

BEN
The engine’s overheating
We’ll have to go easy for a while

MARK
Were never going to find her on our own
Why don’t you get on your radio and call in
air support or something

BEN doesn’t look at him and MARK begins to get irritable

MARK
God damn it What kind of cop are you anyway

BEN
I’m a small town cop

MARK
You want him don’t you The guy she’s with
You don’t care about Wendy You’re not even
interested in her are you

BEN
You’re the one who lost her
I can’t get her back for you
118 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN
KILOMETRES NORTH-NORTHWEST

MARK
I love her and she still loves me

BEN
You must have done something to make her
come all the way out here

MARK
We had a fight I hit her

BEN
What the hell for What the hell did
you have to hit her for

MARK
She was seeing another man

BEN
I thought she was meant to love you and
you were meant to love her Didn’t you say

MARK
It wasn’t about love I think it was about his
eyes being blue and mine being brown
(He glances at the wedding ring on BEN’s hand)
You’re married sergeant You must know how
things happen sometimes

BEN
I haven’t seen my wife in fifteen years

MARK
Shit I’m sorry I guess at least that’s old history for you
now huh You got kids We always wanted kids Me and Wendy

BEN
We had a son Jake Some stupid truck accident happened
to him up in the Caprivi He wasn’t even in combat I guess
losing Jake on the wrong side in the war was about as much
as Katie could take I haven’t heard from her since

MARK doesn’t know what to say and for a moment there is an uneasy silence then BEN slips a
battered cassette from his breast pocket holding it up for MARK to see

BEN
She left me this tape I think it was an accident
the song of the humpback whale you heard it
121 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN
KILOMETRES NORTH-NORTHWEST

MARK
No haven’t I’m sorry

BEN
Katie always loved the sea

MARK
I’m sorry about your son I didn’t know

BEN
It’s okay Just don’t give me any more of your grief

The whale song comes over the tapedeck now melancholy and distant as the cry of an unborn child
and BEN falls silent his eyes fixed on the shimmering blue horizon

CUT TO
119 EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE DESERT TWENTY
KILOMETRES SOUTHEAST

WENDY lies quite still beneath a makeshift shelter constructed with the aid of her dress and the
branch of a dead thorn tree She scarcely seems to be breathing her glazed eyes turned towards the
vault of the sky The sky is a blinding white the sun a molten blue rivet

Everywhere the land is silent all movement held in check as if immobilized by the sheer dead
weight of hot air WENDY lets her head loll to one side staring out across the empty flatlands
feeling the dry dirt against her cheek and her bare skin

She realises now that somehow she has reached the sea after all for the field of her vision seems
filled by a shining expanse of water an endless lagoon all silvery and mirror bright She closes her
eyes and the rush of blood in her ears becomes now the soft hiss of waves breaking over sand

Faintly now she begins to hear another sound rising above the beat of her pulse The distant whup-
whup of helicopter rotors

CUT TO
120 EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE DESERT FOUR KILOMETRES
DUE SOUTH

HITCH hears the helicopter coming from where he stands on the crest of a horseshoe dune and he
hurriedly retreats from the skyline keeping his head low

CUT TO
121 EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE DESERT FIFTEEN
KILOMETRES NORTHEAST

A military helicopter is skimming across the landscape like an olive green dragonfly the wind from
its rotors kicking up the dust The insignia on the chopper’s tail identifies it as belonging to the
United Nations peacekeeping force

On the soundtrack we hear the sound of the helicopter radio

PILOT
Delta Zulu to Foxtrot
Delta Zulu to Foxtrot
We are at co-ordinates SS15-1842 approaching end of sweep

CUT TO

122 INTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE LANDROVER

BEN slows the vehicle his ears pricked
MARK glances uneasily at him

MARK
What’s wrong

BEN
Sssh

MARK falls silent and in a moment even he is able to hear the sound of the approaching helicopter
over the insistent throb of the engine

MARK
It’s a chopper A God damn chopper
She’s going to be alright

BEN’s expression seems troubled He reaches suddenly out and lifts the receiver of the CB radio

BEN
Mayday This is Echo Bravo calling Delta Zulu
We are in distress Co-ordinates SE28 - U12

MARK
What are you doing

BEN
I told you to keep your mouth shut
(He lifts the receiver once again)
Mayday Echo Bravo calling Delta Zulu Mayday

CUT TO
123 EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE DESERT
WENDY struggles up the side of a dune her figure very small and pale against the skyline She
holds her dress above her head waving it to try and attract the helicopter’s attention her hair

fluttering around her in the rising wind her tiny naked figure curiously surreal against the orange
immensity

She sees the helicopter now the sunlight glinting on its cockpit windows

CUT TO

124 INTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE COCKPIT
The helicopter PILOT raises his receiver as he picks up BEN’s distress signal on the radio

BEN’S VOICE
Mayday Echo Bravo calling Delta Zulu Come in Delta Zulu

PILOT
This is Zulu Delta We are altering course to investigate
Co-ordinates SE28 - U12

CUT TO

125 INTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE LANDROVER

MARK grabs BEN’s wrist trying to tear him away from the radio WATCHER turns on him with a
snarl and the landrover lurches violently as BEN’s hand falters on the wheel

MARK
What the hell are you doing
Those are the wrong co-ordinates

CUT TO

126 EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE DESERT

WENDY watches helplessly as the helicopter banks and turns away barely a kilometre before
reaching her

WENDY
No Come back

The helicopter climbs higher the sound of its rotors growing fainter as it disappears slowly
eastwards

CUT TO
127 INTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON THE LANDROVER

BEN has regained his grip on the wheel while WATCHER keeps an eye on MARK who is
cowering against the far door

MARK
You don’t care if she lives or dies do you

BEN doesn’t reply

MARK
Do you you son of a bitch You don’t want to
arrest him The guy she’s with You’re not even
thinking of arresting him

BEN
I never said I was

MARK
You’re out of your mind

BEN
If you don’t like it you can get out here
You ride with me you ride with my rules
MARK
You crazy bastard You’re going to kill her
You’re going to kill all of us

BEN
I told you to keep your mouth shut

WATCHER growls ominously at him and MARK falls silent

CUT TO

128 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DESERT
The helicopter is gone now
The desert has fallen silent once more as the sky begins to shade into gold

WENDY’s naked figure stands forlornly on the dunecrest the dress still held limply in her
hands her eyes turned towards the empty sky

CUT TO
129 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DESERT FOUR-HUNDRED METRES WEST

HITCH watches as WENDY pulls her dress on and begins to walk once more keeping the sun at
her back Her movements are painfully slow and increasingly aimless

There is the beginning of a breeze at his coat tails and HITCH turns to the west and bows before
beginning to make a weird series of movements like an orchestra conductor conducting silence
And gradually the wind rises

The sand begins to lift in a fine haze across the crest of the dune and an orange column rises in the
West like a dragon uncoiling itself from the earth HITCH blows like a kite along the dune crest
dancing in the shadow of the dust devil

CUT TO
130 EXTERIOR DUSK THE DUNE SEA FOUR-HUNDRED METRES EAST

WENDY feels the wind buffeting her first then turns and sees the coming storm Backlit by the
setting sun it appears to her as a great wave born of fire its wispy tendrils coiling rapidly towards
her through the cooling air

WENDY
Oh God

She turns and tries to run but there is nowhere to run to and the storm is already upon her She
stumbles blindly on for a few hundred yards before falling to one knee the dust devil embracing
her

She clings to the ground her eyes squeezed shut against the stinging barrage struggling to breathe
as the ground itself is sucked out from between her fingers the rushing sand threatening to flay her
skin from her bones

Slowly the sand banks up against her shivering form her shape becoming indistinct her body
blending with the dust And the wind wails around her like the voices of a million tormented souls
crying out in their sleep

CUT TO

131 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

The landrover is pushing on against the storm the sand lashing at its windows its headlights on full
in the premature darkness BEN is squinting into the storm humming tunelessly beneath his breath
trying to remember what it was that JOE was singing

The air inside the landrover is filled with whale song and the drifting greasy smoke of the
smouldering root that hangs on a leather thong from the rear view mirror MARK sits coughing in

the far corner WATCHER taking up most of his seat

MARK
Christ can’t breathe What the hell are you burning that thing for
131 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

BEN
To keep it out

For a moment MARK falls silent His eyes are on WATCHER now
The dog is peering intently at the window its ears pricked a snarl rising in its throat

MARK
What’s out there

BEN
The dust devil I think

MARK gazes upon the storm and for a moment he almost sees it

A screaming distorted mouth seems to open front of the landrover tendrils of dust reaching
towards the windscreen WATCHER suddenly begins to bark and MARK yells in fright throwing
up his arm in front of his face as the vehicle shudders violently The unexpected jolt throws MARK
backwards in his seat and he cracks his head against the doorframe

There is a screech of brakes and for a moment everything seems to be spinning around him Then
he blacks out

When he comes around everything is strangely silent There is a curious sensation of gliding or
floating MARK rubs his eyes feeling a new pain in his chest He looks out into the night trying to
catch a glimpse of the ground but still the illusion of flight persists

All the headlights reveal is a billowing cloud of rising dust

He shakes his head still feeling dizzy trying to understand what is happening to him He wonders if
he is dreaming He reaches into his breast pocket and removes a battered cigarette clenching it in
his mouth

It takes a a little longer to find his lighter and when he does the lighter seems reluctant to produce a
flame Finally he manages to get the cigarette lit closing his eyes for a moment as he takes a drag
trying to get a grip on himself

When he opens his eyes again he notices that the smoke from the cigarette is floating downward as
if it has suddenly grown inexplicably heavy He coughs his eyes widening as a thin trickle of blood
dribbles up his face onto the ceiling

He groans and starts to struggle in his seat as he realises that he is in fact hanging upside down in
his safety belt his knees jammed against the dashboard He drops the cigarette and it bounces onto
the roof as he struggles awkwardly to get the door open

From somewhere out in the night he hears the sound of WATCHER barking and distant gunfire
rising above the wailing wind He undoes his safety belt tumbling in a painful half-somersault from
the landrover which he now discovers is lying on its roof in the bottom of a dry gully its wheels
still spinning in the air whale song playing on its tapedeck
131 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

BEN is stalking aimless around the wreck clutching his shotgun and yelling incoherently at the
storm WATCHER scurrying around him snarling and snapping at the wind As MARK watches
BEN pumps another round into the breech and fires again the flash of the gun momentarily
freezing the particles of sand in midair

Then the light is gone and the wind hurls the sand in their faces MARK struggles to his feet and
stumbles towards BEN yelling above the shriek of the storm

MARK
ARE YOU CRAZY PUT THAT THING DOWN

BEN turns to MARK and his face is terrible his eyes wide and dazed with fear He seems
completely mad

BEN
OUT OF THE WAY GET OUT

He pushes MARK to one side stumbling past him as he takes aim and fires again MARK falls to
one knee wincing at the sound of the blast the wind stinging his face MARK’s hand moves to the
small of his back to find the butt of the handgun still nestling against his bruised flesh He draws the
gun levelling it at BEN’s back

MARK
DROP THE GUN NOW

BEN turns slowly the shotgun still in his hands the wind buffeting him
MARK rises slowly to his feet keeping his own gun levelled at BEN’s head
BEN stares at him his eyes as cold as stones

MARK
DON’T COME ANY CLOSER YOU MAD BASTARD

BEN takes a step closer the shotgun wavering in his hands WATCHER stands snarling beside
him tensing as if preparing to spring

MARK
YOU WANT TO DIE

BEN
Fifteen years

MARK
What

BEN
Fifteen years I’ve been waiting for this
131 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

MARK
PUT IT DOWN OR I SWEAR TO GOD ILL BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF

BEN reaches slowly into his pocket the smile fixed on his face as he withdraws his hand once
more clenched now into a fist

MARK takes a step backwards as BEN reaches out unclenching his fingers to show him a cluster
of bullets nestling in the palm of his hand

BEN
I unloaded it before I gave it back to you

He upends his hand letting the bullets fall into the dust
He raises the shotgun and MARK pulls the trigger on an empty chamber
He backs off shaking the gun falling from his hands

BEN
After fifteen years do you think I’d let some
city boy like you mess it all up for me

He levels the shotgun at MARK’s head

MARK
No Please I’ve done nothing

BEN shoves the barrel at MARK’s face and MARK closes his eyes whimpering

MARK
Please God Why are you doing this to me

BEN
Maybe it’s because of the colour of your eyes
you know how things are

BEN throws a pair of handcuffs at MARK’s feet nodding towards the overturned landrover

BEN
Put them on One end around your wrist
and the other around the fender

MARK does as he’s told chaining himself to the bumper the licence plate just above his head the
headlights lancing into the night on either side of him

MARK
You can’t do this You’ll never get away with it

BEN
I’ve been here all my life Do you think I don’t
know how things work out here
131 EXTERIOR NIGHT THE DESERT

MARK
But you’re a cop

BEN
Not anymore I haven’t been a cop for some time now

BEN’s expression softens for a moment almost into a look of regret His anger is suddenly gone
just as the wind itself begins to die away

MARK
Please let me go don’t leave me here

BEN
Do what she to you City boy Be kind to
yourself and you’ll stand a better chance
I think he only takes the hopeless

The look in his eyes causes MARK to fall silent Then BEN turns away WATCHER following at
his heels the darkness swallowing him

CUT TO

132 EXTERIOR DAWN THE DESERT

The wind is still The desert breathless as if in anticipation of the coming light

WENDY lies curled in a foetal position in the dust the sand banked in ripples against her

She does not stir as HITCH walks towards her He stands over her for a moment and then slowly
bends kneeling beside her sleeping form

At that moment the rim of the sun appears over the horizon and the sky slowly begins to

turn from red to gold HITCH watches the sunrise for a while before turning to look at WENDY
wanting to share this moment with her He reaches down and touches her hair

In the dawn light her face is like the countenance of some ancient statue raised from the

sand by the desert wind He does not wake her but instead sits quietly at her side watching the

coming light

CUT TO

133 EXTERIOR DAWN THE DESERT HALF A KILOMETRE WEST

BEN marches into the rising sun his eyes shielded by the brim of his hat the shotgun cradled in his
arms WATCHER following snuffling at his heels He scarcely sees the dawn

CUT TO
134 EXTERIOR DAWN THE DESERT HALF A KILOMETRE EAST

HITCH turns slowly away from the rising sun trying to etch the memory of its light into his
memory not knowing if he will have the chance to see such a sight again He looks down at
WENDY something almost sad in his expression

She is so beautiful
He reaches out to gently caress her cheek with his grubby hand and she sighs turning in her sleep
her movement disturbing the intricate ripples of the sand He withdraws his hand

WENDY moans softly and opens her eyes The moment she wakes she feels HITCH’s presence and
she sits up suddenly in panic glancing around herself HITCH is nowhere to be seen

She relaxes slowly and it is only a moment later as she rubs her eyes that she sees HITCH’s tracks
in the sand The trail leads away from her up the side of a low dune and she rises uneasily to her
feet knowing she has no option but to follow it

She clambers to the top of the dune breaking into a run as she nears its crest seeing on the other
side the top of a line of telegraph poles and beyond that the corrugated iron rooftops of a small
town

Tears well up in her eyes blurring her vision and it is a moment before she realizes that the town is
strangely silent

WENDY
Oh God No

Her eyes widen now as she gazes upon the streets

The tops of the telegraph poles are barely waist high each building buried up to its first floor in a
drift of orange sand the dunes reaching in through the shattered windows to fill their empty rooms
The whole town is deserted long since dead and given up to the wasteland its architecture frozen
somewhere in the thirties

She stumbles down the side of the dune running parallel to the telegraph poles up what must have
once been the town’s main street

WENDY
NO PLEASE SOMEBODY THERE
MUST BE SOMEBODY HERE

A low animal snarl comes in response and she freezes in her tracks as a large panting dog comes
padding around the comer of the street its lips pulled back to reveal a line of gleaming yellow teeth

WENDY
Hitch

The dog raises its snout towards her and snarls

She starts to take a step backwards when a man appears behind the dog
134 EXTERIOR DAWN THE DESERT HALF A KILOMETRE EAST

BEN’s nerves are frayed to their limit He levels the shotgun at the sound as he sees her movement
drawing a bead on her before he realises who she is

WENDY dives for shelter just as he lowers the shotgun

BEN
Mrs Robinson Wait

WENDY gets to her hands and knees doing a fast crawl through one of the open windows and
disappearing into the gloom of a sanded-in building

BEN
No Come back Everything’s alright

Her movement is like a red rag to a bull for WATCHER who cannot restrain himself any longer
racing after her barking furiously

BEN
WATCHER NO COME BACK HERE

The dog disappears through the open window paying him no attention

CUT TO

135 INTERIOR DAY THE DERELICT BUILDING

WENDY scampers on all fours across the sanded in room her head almost scraping the light fixture
as she passes

She reaches the doorway leading to the stairs but the aperture is very small and before she has time
to squeeze herself through the dog is already upon her She throws her back to the wall lashing out
with her feet feeling the dog’s teeth snapping at her legs

WENDY
NO GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM ME

A lucky kick finds the dog in the chest and it backs off for a moment yelping She edges towards
the doorway as the dog lowers its muzzle once more its eyes full of stupid hatred

Then WATCHER pauses and turns sniffing the air his hackles rising as if sensing the presenee of
something WENDY cannot see or know WATCHER looks towards the street and a terrible whine
rises from its throat and WENDY takes the opportunity to scramble through the doorway into the
interior of the building

CUT TO
136 EXTERIOR DAY THE GHOST TOWN

BEN hears WATCHER whine and he steps slowly towards the building the shotgun wavering in
his hands

BEN
Watcher Mrs Robinson

He lowers the gun clipping it onto safety and reaching into his pocket with one hand he slowly
withdraws the magic kierie

BEN
Wendy

BEN starts forward plunging into the waiting darkness of the derelict building

CUT TO

137 INTERIOR DAY THE DERELICT BUILDING

BEN wanders deeper into the sanded in building feeling like a ghost himself now Everywhere here
are piled sand drifts and thin shafts of pale sunlight cutting through the dusty air Everywhere here
are memories of a vanished people and a vanished era Wasted sanded-in lives He sniffs the air
his eyes adjusting slowly to the gloom

BEN
Watcher Mrs Robinson

He squeezes through a sanded-in doorway and finds himself in a low corridor taking another
turning to emerge into a long gloomy bowling alley a line of skittles still standing at its far end an
old-fashioned ice box in one corner of the room the light strewn like rushes across the floor He
pauses sure that he can hear something

BEN
Wendy

And it is if he hears the sound of distant music now
An antique piano
An echo of laughter already fading

He turns and for a moment he almost sees their outlines in the dusty sunlight The hardy settlers of
the Skeleton Coast their shadows surrounding him greeting him as if in a dream The light behind
them obscures their features but BEN imagines now that they are not the faces of the dead but the
features of his own townsfolk

HENDRYK AARON KORNELIUS JOE SAARTIJIE standing in the shadows the dust covering
their feet He looks for KATIE but cannot see her In her place he sees the outline of a young man
much like himself and BEN steps towards him
137 INTERIOR DAY THE DERELICT BUILDING

BEN
Jake

But as he approaches him the figure seems to draw further away disappearing at last into the
gloom He realises that he must be going mad

He sees a light now at the far end of the bowling alley and he moves towards it seeking relief from
the silence and darkness of dried-out wood and crumbling stone

The light solidifies into a doorway and he steps back out into the street of the deserted town

CUT TO

138 EXTERIOR DAY THE GHOST TOWN

He almost bumps right into the man who is standing waiting for him
BEN glances bemusedly at him seeing his blonde hair and blue eyes

BEN
Who are you

The man smiles reassuringly at him

Then something flashes in his hand and the blade of HITCH’s knife plunges into BEN’s diaphragm
at the precise moment that BEN sees the dried blood on HITCH’s face and realises his mistake

The blade plunges upwards into his ribcage the force of the blow driving him backwards the kierie
tumbling from his hand blood already pulsing down his legs He gasps as HITCH twists the knife
inside him feeling it puncture his heart

He staggers pulling free of the blade seeing his blood dewing HITCH’s face He tries to speak his
words thick with blood his eyes still bemused

BEN
But

He tries to say something else maybe to ask something of his murderer but a thick jet of blood
gushes from his lips instead of words and a look of indescribable sorrow fills his eyes as if in this
moment he feels he has been betrayed by everything

He wavers a second longer blood fountaining from him and then he pitches forward falling stiff as
a felled tree to the waiting dust HITCH stands over him polishing his knife on the leg of his jeans
smiling understandingly

BEN scarcely sees the dust now but seems instead to be looking across a bright green lawn towards
the edge of the verandah where KATIE sits with JAKE on her lap the football still cradled in his
arms And it is as if the football is the globe of the world and KATIE smiling is the virgin herself
138 EXTERIOR DAY THE GHOST TOWN

He tries to speak her name and there comes instead a wordless voice like the cry of an unborn child
or a whale dreaming in the cool green depths of the ocean

139 INTERIOR DAY BEN’S BEDROOM

CUT TO

140 EXTERIOR DAY THE GHOST TOWN

A gust of wind comes up and the dust rises to drink BEN MUKUROB’s blood HITCH looks up
from the corpse just as WATCHER bursts from the derelict building barking frenziedly smelling
his master’s blood

HITCH smiles at the dog the knife glistening in his hand

CUT TO

141 INTERIOR DAY THE DERELICT BUILDING
WENDY scampers towards the window keeping to the shadows watching as the dog circles
HITCH HITCH’s eyes are rooted on WATCHER’s and he turns slowly with the dog unwittingly

presenting his back to her

She scrambles quickly towards BEN’s corpse her eyes fixed on the shotgun still clutched in his
hands

CUT TO

142 EXTERIOR DAY THE GHOST TOWN

A wordless communication seems to pass between HITCH and the dog WATCHER’s growls
subsiding into whimpers as HITCH advances on him the knife poised

WENDY pushes at BEN’s corpse rolling his body off the shotgun and trying to extract his frozen
fingers from the trigger guard

WATCHER chooses this moment to turn tail and run scampering away down the street in a series
of frightened yelps

HITCH grins broadly turning back towards the derelict building
142 EXTERIOR DAY THE GHOST TOWN

HITCH
It’s okay Wendy You can come out now Everything’s hunky-dory

WENDY is aiready kneeling in the dust the shotgun in her hands Their eyes meet for a split
second as she levels the gun at his head and pulls the trigger Nothing happens She pulls the trigger
again Still nothing

HITCH
It’s on safety

WENDY
What

HITCH
You’ve got the safety catch on
It’s that little lever next to the breech

WENDY looks slowly from HITCH to the gun seeing at once that he’s right She glances up at him
to make sure he’s not trying anything on He shrugs raising his hands She clips the gun off safety
taking aim once more

WENDY
Back off Hands in the air I mean it

HITCH
What are you going to do Shoot me

WENDY
Fuck yes

HITCH
You got no right to shoot me

WENDY
You tried to kill me You killed those other women

HITCH
That’s because they wanted to die That’s because you wanted die the
day before yesterday People only come to me when they want to die

WENDY
Well I want to live now you crazy bastard I changed my mind

HITCH
Then what would I want to hurt you for

WENDY
Drop the knife Now
142 EXTERIOR DAY THE GHOSTTOWN

HITCH
Sure

He lets the blade fail and for a moment all they can do is stand and stare at each other not knowing
what to do or say The wind is stili rising and now inexplicably the day begins to darken the sky
suddenly filled with clouds

HITCH takes off his hat and looks towards the sky

HITCH
It’s going to rain I think it’s actually going to rain
First time in seven years

He looks her in the eye once more and her grip on the shotgun wavers

HITCH
Only love will make it rain I do love you Wendy
With all my soul I always have I always will

Thunder rumbles in the distance and WENDY thinks she feels a drop of water on her face

WENDY
Who the hell are you

HITCH
You must believe Wendy What else can I do to
convince you I’d walk on water if we had any

WENDY
You son of a bitch I almost do believe you

The shotgun shivers in her hands HITCH takes a step closer

HITCH
You can save me There can be life in this place
And happiness We should be happy because of death
because life is random because it is so short yet so
filled with beauty There is no such thing as evil
No such thing as darkness Only light

WENDY looks up towards the clouds seeing lightning flicker in the distance
HITCH takes another step towards her and she glances nervously back at him

WENDY
Hitch

HITCH
I love you Wendy
142 EXTERIOR DAY THE GHOST TOWN

He lashes suddenly out with his boot kicking her in the wrist and sending the shotgun flying from
her hands his arm arcing back as he flicks a straight razor from his sleeve

WENDY
NO I WANT TO LIVE

And HITCH screams now like a hyena brandishing the razor so that it is caught in a ray of desert
sun that bursts suddenly through the clouds The blade descends in a gleaming arc and she reels
backwards as the side of her face is laid open in a welter of blood

She stumbles away screaming trying to shield herself HITCH dancing after her the razor flashing
in his hand The back of her foot strikes BEN’s body and she overbalances falling heavily beside
his corpse clutching at her maimed face blood dripping between her fingers

HITCH steps lightly after her raising the blade once more his face frozen in a feral grin

Then he freezes

His smile dies as he glances down to see that he had stepped over the fallen kierie He looks up at
BEN’s corpse suddenly realising what has happened He sees BEN’s eyes lifeless now yet
somehow watchful and accusing

He glances back at WENDY

She has used his momentary distraction to grab up the shotgun and is levelling it at his head her
face a mask of blood

HITCH
Wendy

There is a note of uncertainty in his voice For the first time his eyes seem almost vulnerable
Almost human

Then WENDY pulls the trigger and the expression vanishes from his eyes forever as his head
disintegrates in a spray of blood and bone shards The kick of the blast drives WENDY backwards
as HITCH’s body tumbles away from her crumpling to the dirt in the middle of the main street

She lies on her back for a while moaning HITCH still twitching a few feet away from her his
fingers clutching helplessly at the air Gradually his movements cease and WENDY slowly
struggles to her knees sobbing as she tears a strip from her dress to hold against her wounded face
HITCH lying beside her has no face left at all She remains there kneeling with him rocking
herself from side to side until the bleeding stops the wind lifting the dust around her in a stinging
haze slowly burying BEN and HITCH

It refuses to rain

CUT TO
143 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT

The clouds are parting and the first real heat of the day is just starting to reach MARK who is still
hanging on as if crucified from the front of the landrover the radio crackling unreachably behind
him

RADIO
This is Foxtrot calling Echo Bravo Foxtrot
calling Echo Bravo Come in Echo Bravo

MARK’s head is bowed His entire body aching with pain and exhaustion

Through narrow half-lidded eyes he sees a figure come striding towards him through the heathaze
a shotgun propped over its shoulders and a dog following at its heels It is only when he hears
WATCHER snarling that he opens his eyes

MARK
Wendy

There is no recognition in her eyes Eyes that have become terribly distant as if glazed forever by
the sun deep set in a pale blood-streaked face

WATCHER continues to snarl at him

MARK
Wendy it’s alright It’s Mark

She steps towards hirn levelling the shotgun and he cringes

MARK
Wendy please

Her expression remains implacable

MARK
Please I didn’t mean to hit you
Wendy For God’s sake

He closes his eyes anticipating the gunshot

MARK
I don’t want to die

For a moment there is silence When Mark opens his eyes she is already walking away

MARK
No Come back I love you We can start again
I swear to God Everything can be alright
It can be just like the old days We can forget
this ever happened
143 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT
WENDY keeps walking
MARK tugs at the end of his chain the handcuff rubbing his wrist raw and bloody as he tries in

vain to pull the landrover forward

MARK
Wendy Please Don’t leave me here

But she does not look back

CUT TO

144 EXTERIOR DAY THE DESERT

The sky is cloudless the sun blistering WENDY’s back as she walks Her skin is dark and
sunburned her feet a deep purple colour now almost black Every step for her is like walking on
knives yet somehow the pain comforts her

In proving that she is still alive it gives her strength She rides her pain ali the way to the freeway
singing a wordless song very much like the song that JOE sang at the campfire WATCHER

limping at her heels

CUT TO

145 EXTERIOR DAY THE FREEWAY

WENDY slowly climbs the gravel verge to the asphalt river

The air here is quicksilver

A rippling heat haze across the morning

WENDY’s figure warping in and out of shape as if crossing over from one world to another

She seems scarcely human A dancing ghost herself now blistered feet walking the white line

There is a low tremor
A bass rumble like distant thunder

She pauses and then bending puts her ear to the line and listens to the road
There is a glimmer in the heat haze

Something swimming into life in the far distance

Sunlight flashing on metal

An armoured car the first vehicle of a militaty convoy appears riding on air the rumble of diesel
engines growing louder

WENDY props the shotgun over her shoulder stepping slowly out into the road
145 EXTERIOR DAY THE FREEWAY
The sun glints on the approaching windshield

She can see the faces of the soldiers now
She raises her hand

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
146 EXTERIOR DUSK NOWHERE

The figure of a traveller silhouetted momentarily against its glare a battered hat riding on his head
and a ragged coat fluttering behind him The figure walks towards the light and it seems now that
having reached the threshold of eternity all of God’s creation lies spread before his bootheels

JOE (VOICE OVER)
We must struggle to breathe the wind a while longer
to preserve the stories and the memories To teach
the children to read the stony secrets of the hills and
listen for the distant singing of the stars And to trace
within the searing sun at noon the tragic golden glory
of creation

Then there is only silence and the golden light

Fade to black
Roll end titles
