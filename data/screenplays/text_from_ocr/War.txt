Somewhere Over The Afghanistan-Pakistan Border

Patrick is packed into the belly of a red tactically lit
military cargo plane dressed in BATTLE FATIGUES with a
Kevlar helmet strapped to his head

He’s surrounded by heavily armed AIRBORNE INFANTRY TROOPS
prepping munitions and packs in the dim red light The ROAR
of the engines is deafening Turbulence rocks their ride

CAPTAIN STILLS a fierce stout bulldog of a man flips the
stub of a cigar from one corner of his mouth to the other and
strides down the aisle

AIRMAN

ALL
30 minutes

STILLS
See you on the ground

Patrick SNAPS a magazine into his M-16 Seated next to him
is PRIVATE SIMMONS His uniform and gear are stiff and new
His face lacks the cracked desert tan of Patrick’s

SIMMONS
(through clenched teeth)
This is my first combat jump

PATRICK
Could’ve fooled me

Patrick double checks his chute and slaps his pack

PATRICK
When we hit the ground stay close
I’ve done this a few times

FORTE (0S)
Yeah five fuckin’ tours

SPECIALIST FORTE a cocky kid with a shit eating grin offers
a TATTERED DECK OF CARDS from across the aisle Tattooed on
his dirt stained knuckles are a HEART a DIAMOND a CLUB and
a SPADE

FORTE
What is it three in Iraq two in
Afghanistan You’re outta your
mind you hardcore mother fucker
(to Simmons )
Hey Simmons pick a card

Catching Simmons off guard--

SIMMONS
Pick a card

FORTE
We draw cards before we go in

SIMMONS
I don’t gamble
FORTE
Then what are you doing here
Trust me you’re all in

Forte passes the deck around Other MEN draw a card

FORTE
Low card is the loser

He offers the deck to Patrick but he won’t take one

FORTE
Come on Patrick This shit’s
right every time

Simmons draws his card and starts to turn it over--

FORTE
Hold the fuck on Simmons God-
damn new guy gonna fuck this up

Forte shows Simmons

FORTE
You don’t get to look at it

Forte puts his card in the band of his helmet for everyone
but himself to see It’s the KING OF HEARTS The rest of
the men follow

FORTE
You see everyone else’s but not
your own This way I know who to
stay clear of on the field

Simmons slides his card into his helmet Forte inches away
in faux terror Simmons cracks an uneasy smile

SIMMONS
Fuck you Forte
(beat)
What
He quickly pulls the card and looks at it The SIX OF HEARTS

SIMMONS
Shit This is bad isn’t it

The men LAUGH Patrick interjects drawing a card

PATRICK
Don’t worry about it Simmons
Patrick lifts his card to his helmet and slides it into the
band

PATRICK
Just superstitious bullshit

Everyone looks at Patrick’s card The PLANE the MEN
EVERYTHING falls SILENT--

--THE ACE OF SPADES

PATRICK
It’s only cards

BOOM ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE HITS THE PLANE Patrick is thrown
from his seat Blood SPRAYS across the aisle covering Forte

FORTE
Oh fuck

AIR RUSHES through a GAPING HOLE IN THE PLANE where Simmons
was sitting He’s gone An ALARM SOUNDS

STILLS
Everyone out

Another EXPLOSION The plane pitches hard to the side
Patrick grabs Forte--

PATRICK
Get to the door

He snaps Forte’s static line to the overhead cable

PATRICK
Now

Patrick struggles to connect his own line when--

Another MASSIVE EXPLOSION hits the aircraft The entire tail
section is BLOWN OFF sucking DOZENS OF MEN out

Stills grasps the static line above his head his body drawn
perpendicular from the suction Patrick reaches for him but
it’s too late-- Stills is sucked out

ANOTHER EXPLOSION Soldiers fall out of the plane as the
aircraft goes inverted Patrick lunges forward with the roll
and dives out the door
EXT FALLING THROUGH THE SKY - NIGHT

Patrick engages his chute and looks above He sees his
burning plane coming straight toward him The falling
wreckage rushes by just missing him He follows it down
watching it CRASH into the battlefield below

Patrick casts around The horizon is filled with HUNDREDS OF
CHUTES and more aircraft FALLING FROM THE SKY On the ground
below a major battle erupts

THOUSANDS are fighting

PATRICK
Jesus

EXT RIDGELINE - NIGHT

Patrick slams into the ground He sheds his chute as more
SOLDIERS drop into the rugged mountain terrain He sees
Forte rushes to him Forte’s face is still covered in
blood

FORTE
This don’t look like Jalalabad to
me

Patrick sees the other soldiers race up a rocky hillside He
pulls Forte to his feet and they follow

As they reach the top HEAVY TRACER FIRE breaks out from the
other side The first line of soldiers are riddled with
bullets The rest drop and RETURN FIRE

Patrick can’t pinpoint the enemy in the darkness and pulls a
flare from his belt slamming it into the ground

The FLARE STREAKS into the air and BURSTS TO LIFE revealing
HUNDREDS OF ENEMY SOLDIERS to their front Streams of TRACER
FIRE pour out of their positions hitting all around

FORTE
Now what

Incoming mortars WHISTLE through the air

PATRICK
Incoming DOWN DOWN DOWN

Men scatter as a barrage of MORTARS rain in EXPLODING all
around them Many are blown to bits

Suddenly a HUMVEE races into the valley below guns blazing
FORTE
First Armored is here

EXT VALLEY BELOW - NIGHT
The calvary is short lived The Humvee takes enemy fire and

EXPLODES A SECOND HUMVEE appears followed quickly by a
ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER

The APC’s 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN rumbles to life The back
door ramps down and INFANTRY MEN rush into the fray

TRACERS crisscross in every direction A pair of ENEMY RPG’S
swing through the air The first HITS the Humvee lifting
the chassis off the ground as it EXPLODES The other SLAMS
into the APC rocking it in place

The 50 CALIBER goes SILENT the gunner killed DEAD and
WOUNDED are scattered about A group of soldiers are pinned
down at the burning Humvee

The flare dies out sending the field back into DARKNESS
EXT RIDGELINE - NIGHT

Patrick pulls NIGHT VISION GOGGLES from his pack snaps them
to his helmet and clicks them on He sees the soldiers
pinned down at the Humvee taking heavy fire His POV whips

to the dead gunner atop the APC

PATRICK
Theyre pinned down

FORTE
Well what are we waiting for

Patrick and Forte rush down the face of the ridge

EXT VALLEY BELOW - NIGHT

Tracers fly all around them as they dive in behind the APC
Through his night vision goggles Patrick sees a horde of

TALIBAN and AL-QAEDA pour into the mountain pass

PATRICK
They’re pulling up the flanks

A sudden BURST of tracer fire strikes Forte in the chest he
slumps to the ground motionless

With gunfire pouring in Patrick has only one choice--
--he scrambles up the APC ramp and hoists himself to the
roof Bullets RICOCHET all around as he pulls the DEAD
SOLDIER from the 50 caliber turret

THE ENEMY CHARGES
Patrick drops in pulls the bolt back targets the flanking

forces and opens FIRE The 50 caliber tears through the
advancing fighters but there are too many

BULLETS RAIN in all around Patrick striking him multiple
times Rounds pierce his arms pound him in the chest He’s
covered in blood but he never lets loose of the trigger

On the ground a TALIBAN FIGHTER closes and takes careful
aim His SIGHT falls on PATRICK’S HEAD

A single shot ECHOES--

--the BULLET slams into Patrick’s helmet snapping his head
back--

--the LAST 50 CALIBER ROUND SLIPS THROUGH THE CHAMBER The
gun goes SILENT smoke wisping from the barrel Patrick’s
BLOODY FINGERS slip from the trigger

An ACE OF SPADES playing card flips through the air A blood
stained BULLET HOLE through its center

A STREAM OF BLOOD trickles down between Patrick’s eyes He’s
been shot in the head His eyes roll back as he slides from
the turret and tumbles lifelessly through the air

SMASH CUT TO
EXT BARREN FIELD - NIGHT

BLACKNESS A momentary silence interrupted by a DISTORTED
ECHOING VOICE--

COLT (0S)
Patrick Patrick Snap out of it

Patrick’s eyes flutter and focus He finds COLT a FIELD
MEDIC kneeling over him reading his dog tags

Patrick can barely make out COLT’s face let alone his hollow
words

A barrage of BULLETS zip over their heads and the DEAFENING
ROAR of battle returns Patrick refocuses pulling Colt
close to him

PATRICK
Forte

COLT
What

PATRICK

Did did he make it
Another barrage of bullets Colt pulls Patrick down--

COLT
Looks like it’s just you here

It’s only when Colt tosses a DOUGHBOY helmet on his head does
Patrick realize that the field medic is wearing a WORLD WAR I
UNIFORM

PATRICK
What the fuck is going on

Colt grabs Patrick and pulls him along Patrick looks around
and realizes that he’s not in Afghanistan anymore

The landscape is barren blackened and bombed out BLOOD RED
CLOUDS churn in the night sky It’s a WASTELAND

Patrick reaches to his forehead THERE’S NO BLOOD

Colt and Patrick scramble to a ridge of rubble where a group
of SOLDIERS are hunkered down firing at an UNSEEN ENEMY

These soldiers are DIFFERENT--

They’re led by a soldier in a BRITISH REDCOAT uniform MAJOR
WORTHINGTON The men call him “Red” He has an AK-47 in one
hand and a Thompson sub machine gun in the other RPG rocket
launchers grenades and explosives are slung over his broad
shoulders

COLT
Red we got a new one

WORTHINGTON
Splendid Just what we need at
this precise moment

PATRICK
Holy shit you’re a redcoat

WORTHINGTON
Wonderful and he’s a bloody Yank

Fighting next to Worthington are two soldiers from the Civil
War One a UNION SOLDIER the other a CONFEDERATE The
CONFEDERATE PRIVATE HILL is armed with an M-60 MACHINE GUN
a medieval morning star and a sawed off shotgun Belts and
belts of ammo crisscross his frame The little guy is buried
in bullets

PATRICK
A confederate What the hell

Colt gets to his feet pointing beyond the ridgeline

COLT
There there there

WORTHINGTON
Stand your ground Hill

Worthington and Colt dash down the ridge leaving Patrick and
the Civil War soldiers behind

Hill pops over the top of the ridge and FIRES then ducks for
cover The Union Soldier follows suit but he’s HIT before
he can fire He tumbles to the ground

Hill rushes to him applies pressure to his wounds It looks
bad for the Union Soldier Hill searches for Colt--

HILL
Doc Doc

Hill stops on Patrick--

HILL
You Get yer ass over here

Patrick is reluctant Hill draws a revolver--

HILL
Get over here Now

Patrick cautiously moves Hill forces Patrick’s hands onto
the wounds

HILL
Keep pressure on ‘em and don’t ya
let go I’m gonna go fetch the
Doc

The Union Soldier SCREAMS IN PAIN

PATRICK
Wait

HILL
Take yer hands off I’1l kill ya

Hill rushes off leaving the two alone Patrick and the Union
Soldier LOCK EYES Patrick can’t believe it This really is
a soldier from the Civil War

He’s young maybe sixteen His face ashen His eyes dark
and weary-- an aging soul in an ageless body He recognizes
the confusion on Patrick’s face--

UNION SOLDIER
I know what you’re thinking

Patrick tries to take it all in A Redcoat a Confederate a
wounded Union soldier--

UNION SOLDIER
-and you’re right

The Union Soldier cracks a bloody smile--

UNION SOLDIER
--you’re dead

The Union Soldier’s EYES dart to movement over Patrick’s
shoulder Patrick reels around

A NAZI in an SS UNIFORM appears at the top of the ridge He
lifts his sub-machine

The Union Soldier pushes Patrick out of harm’s way and DRAWS
A PISTOL The two FIRE simultaneously hitting each other
The Nazi is knocked off the top of the ridge

Patrick puts pressure to the Union Soldier’s new wounds when
inexplicably FLAMES SHOOT OUT OF THE BULLET HOLES He pulls
his hands back

The Union Soldier HOWLS IN PAIN
Hill and Colt return to find Patrick kneeling helplessly at
the Union Soldier’s side Hill sees FIRE SHOOTING out of the

Union Soldier’s wounds

HILL
Ahh shit Get on ‘em Doc

COLT
It’s too late

Colt calls down the ridge

COLT
McKee

HILL
Fuck that Doc Don’t ya let ‘em
die

COLT

Look at him Hill He’s already
sparked He’s done You know it

In dives CHAPLAIN MCKEE dressed in worn VIETNAM FATIGUES and
armed only with a BIBLE He’s more infantry than clergy

HILL
Don’t just give up on ‘em

Hill drops down desperately putting pressure on the Union
Soldier’s FLAMING WOUNDS but the heat is too great

McKee begins Last Rites-—-

MCKEE
The Lord is my Shepherd I shall
not want He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures He leadeth me
beside the still waters He
restoreth my soul

The FLAMES INTENSIFY McKee recognizes what is to come
slowly steps back

MCKEE
(quickly)
Yea though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death I
will fear no evil

Then suddenly the Union Soldier’s ENTIRE BODY BURSTS into
FLAMES The blast knocking Patrick to the ground

The Union Soldier is COMPLETELY ENGULFED the FLAMES ROAR to
a climax build to a GIANT BLAST OF HEAT a FLASH--

--and the soldier is GONE

Patrick can’t believe his eyes THE UNION SOLDIER’S BODY HAS
COMPLETELY VANISHED Only his WEAPON and HAT remain

Hill grabs Patrick--

HILL
Get on yer feet

Hill draws his revolver pushes it to Patrick’s head

PATRICK
Hold on

McKee tries to separate the two

MCKEE
Hill

Hill draws another pistol on McKee He’s in a rage

HILL
Stay outta this

MCKEE
You gonna shoot me Hill

McKee throws his BIBLE to the ground

MCKEE
Why don’t I let them shoot me
instead God-damn it

McKee stumbles to the top of the ridge completely exposed to
the enemy

Worthington comes charging back and snatches the pistol from
Hill’s hand--

WORTHINGTON
That’s enough

A NAZI pops up behind Hill Worthington drops him with a
SINGLE SHOT Like the Union Soldier moments ago the Nazi
IMPLODES into a BALL OF FIRE and DISAPPEARS

Worthington tosses the weapon back to Hill then sees McKee’s
suicidal march--

WORTHINGTON
McKee what the bloody hell are you
doing The enemy is over there

McKee is drawing the Nazi’s fire

WORTHINGTON
Gawonii

GAWONII a CHEROKEE from the French and Indian War appears at
Worthington’s side His buckskin vest sports an assortment
of knives and TWO TOMAHAWKS hanging at his shoulders

WORTHINGTON
Come on lads

Worthington leads his men in a charge over the ridgeline
Patrick watches as they OPEN FIRE overwhelming the remaining
Nazis with their marksmanship Again the Nazis IMPLODE and
DISAPPEAR as they are killed

WORTHINGTON
Cease Fire

The battlefield falls silent McKee stomps down the other
side of the ridge

WORTHINGTON
McKee McKee Not before we clear
it

McKee ignores him Worthington scans the area--

WORTHINGTON
Hill where in the bloody hell is
Moore

HILL

Dead I reckon

COLT
(pointing)
There he is

A SOLDIER peers out from behind cover It’s CAPTAIN MOORE
He’s wearing KOREAN WAR FATIGUES and a STEEL HELMET

MOORE
Cease fire

Moore pushes broken wire-framed glasses back onto the bridge
of his nose He’s sweating profusely

HILL
Jesus Moore Yer sweatin’ like a
whore in church

Worthington picks up a Nazi’s smoking helmet--

WORTHINGTON
I believe those were SS Captain

MOORE
I know what they were
WORTHINGTON
My apologies It’s just that I
wasn’t sure you could see them from
your distant position sir

MOORE
Excuse me Major

HILL
Yeah Hiding in the rear ya yella
bellied coward

Moore ignores Hill’s comment
MOORE

Patrick appears at the top of the ridgeline he stumbles down

the other side

WORTHINGTON
(re Patrick)
And what shall we do with him sir

HILL
Kill ‘em

MOORE
Shut up Hill

WORTHINGTON
Colt

COLT is stripping ammo from a rifle

COLT
Red

WORTHINGTON
Round up the Yank’s gear and take
his weapon He stays with you

Colt reaches for Patrick’s M-16 but he resists
levels his Tommy Gun at Patrick--

WORTHINGTON
You lad will do precisely as
youre told

Patrick hands his M-16 to Colt

Worthington

WORTHINGTON
and perhaps just perhaps
youll survive
(beat)
Captain were ready

MOORE
McKee Let’s move out

McKee is atop the ridge with the Union Soldiers RIFLE and
HAT He drives the rifle into the ground barrel first and
hangs the hat from it A FIELD HEADSTONE

McKee moves to the next rifle and helmet Its a Nazi’s
Again he drives the barrel into the ground

COLT
Cmon Mack

McKee doesn’t answer He finds his Bible and picks it up
He slides it into his pack and marches past Colt his eyes
FIXED on Patrick

As McKee walks by Patrick grabs him by the arm--

PATRICK
Where the fuck am I

The men hear the sound of a MAN MOANING They quickly raise

their weapons Worthington cautiously moves past McKee his

AK-47 trained in the direction of the sound

The MOANS lead to a NAZI dying in the blackened underbrush

Flames SPARK out of his wounds Worthington kicks the helmet
off of his head

The Nazi spits a MOUTHFUL OF BLOOD and cusses at Worthington
in German Worthington lowers his rifle--

WORTHINGTON
No ‘sprechen sie’

McKee pulls free from Patrick’s grasp

MCKEE
Welcome to hell

BANG A single shot ECHOES the Nazi bursts into a BALL OF
FLAME

SMASH CUT TO

EXT SPEEDING ACROSS DESOLATE TERRAIN - NIGHT

A raging BALL OF FIRE - that only moments ago was the Nazi -
races across desolate terrain Hundreds of miles in the
blink of an eye

The burning essence streaks NORTH towards a distant MOUNTAIN
RANGE an endless stretch of black jagged peaks ripping into
the blood red sky

EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT

Cresting the range and down the other side the fireball is
swallowed by a GIANT PILLAR OF FLAMES What emerges from the
pillar is something shocking--

The Nazi has been transformed His body now a mix of charred
flesh and burning bone A human no more his corpse
LITERALLY on FIRE

Mindlessly he marches out joining the ranks of MILLIONS just
like him cordoned off into large fighting divisions

They are the FIRE SOLDIERS This is the LEGION OF FIRE

Hidden deep within this mountain range an entire army of
burning soldiers wait massed for battle

EXT DARK FOREST - NIGHT

Patrick is led through a dense blackened forest Dwarfed by
these petrified giants the men step carefully Under the
canopy of gnarled branches they navigate the dark shifting
shadows along their path A HEAVY FOG hangs close to the
ground It’s eerily quiet

Gawonii is at point The rest are staggered behind two-by-
two with Colt and Patrick bringing up the rear

COLT
Krauts
PATRICK
What
COLT
Krauts Who were you fighting
Germans
PATRICK

What Who cares Where are you
taking me

COLT
Take it easy chum You’re just
along for the ride til we get back
to the Western Front

PATRICK
Western Front

COLT
Yeah man There are battles
raging all over this God-damn
place

Gawonii stops suddenly He silently raises his FIST into the
air The platoon freezes A GROWING RUMBLE approaches their
position

PATRICK
What is that

The men fan out and take cover in the underbrush Colt pulls
Patrick to the ground

COLT
(whispers )
Mongols

Down the path Patrick sees HUNDREDS OF MEN marching toward
them in heavy armor wielding battle axes and machine guns

COLT
-nomads barbarians They kill
everything They have no need for
friends or allies And they never
take pris

Colt stops mid-sentence A MONGOL appears directly in front
of them his face hidden beneath an aged iron helmet his
breath visible in the frosty air

Colt clutches his rifle hands shaking Patrick reaches to
him steadies him They hold perfectly still

The column of Mongols continues on The men remain hidden
until they have passed

Gawonii cautiously gets to his feet He looks further up the
path and sees something He signals for Moore to join him
They move up the path leaving the rest of the men behind

HILL
Red Hey Red We gotta move on
Them things can fuckin’ smell us

WORTHINGTON

Keep your powder dry Hill
stand fast ‘till the Captain

returns

We

Hill drops a fresh belt into his M-60

HILL
Fuck Moore man

COLT

Hey Hill shut up

HILL
Hey Colt fuck you
Hill gets to his feet and

Patrick watches in disbelief
Worthington follows
WORTHINGTON

I’m not asking Hill
Hill’s scrappy

Worthington hip tosses Hill to the ground
and quickly back to his feet Worthington drops him again
PATRICK

(under his breath)
Unbelievable This is a God-damn

circus
Worthington and Hill turn to Patrick

WORTHINGTON

(to Patrick)
You have something to say do you

Just then Moore returns

MOORE

What the hell is going on here
The men are silent Moore points to Patrick--
MOORE

You Get up
(to McKee)

Mack you too

Come with me

EXT DARK FOREST - CLEARING
As Patrick gets

Gawonii stands near a wounded SOLDIER
closer he recognizes the soldier

It’s FORTE He’s lying in a POOL OF BLOOD Patrick drops to
his side

FORTE
Patrick

PATRICK
Yeah Forte It’s me

FORTE
(relieved)
Patrick

Patrick pulls Forte’s flak jacket open and finds that he has
been cut by a sword the length of his chest

FORTE
Where where is everybody

PATRICK
I don’t know

Moore interrupts ready to move on

MOORE
(to Gawonii)
Bring the men up

FORTE
Who are these guys

PATRICK
I don’t know

Forte starts to panic--

FORTE
What the fuck is going on

Fire SPARKS out of Forte’s wounds Patrick knows what’s
coming

PATRICK
(to McKee)
What can I do

McKee is silent reaches for his Bible Patrick turns and
sees the pistol on Moore’s hip He looks up to Moore and
gestures to it Moore shakes his head and walks away

FORTE
Patrick

The men file by looking down at Patrick and Forte Forte
watches them pass mystified

FORTE
-I don’t think we made it

The FLAMES in Forte’s wounds grow Forte sees them now

FORTE
Oh my God

Forte SCREAMS as his body EXPLODES INTO FLAME Patrick can
only watch helplessly as Forte is ENGULFED The fire spikes
and Forte VANISHES

McKee picks up Forte’s rifle He drives it into the ground
and hangs his helmet from it

Patrick sees the PLAYING CARD still in the helmet’s band He
plucks it out and tucks it into his shirt pocket

Hill passes by sees the fresh headstone and the mourning
Patrick He LAUGHS--

HILL
Hey look at ‘er this way at least
ya ain’t gotta bury ‘em

Patrick rushes Hill and TACKLES him They exchange a wild
series of blows The men gather around

Patrick sees a KNIFE on Hill’s belt and draws it Patrick
yanks Hill to his feet spins him around and pushes the blade
to his neck

Worthington draws his pistol

WORTHINGTON
Let him go

PATRICK
Get back or this scrawny shit is
dead

WORTHINGTON

Don’t be daft

PATRICK
Shut the fuck up

Worthington takes careful aim

COLT
Red hold your fire

MCKEE
Put the knife down

PATRICK
No We’re not going anywhere until
someone tells me what the fuck is
going on

The men inch toward Patrick He turns Hill keeping himself
shielded

PATRICK
Where the hell am I
WORTHINGTON
I don’t know
PATRICK
What do you mean you don’t know
WORTHINGTON
Exactly that None of us knows for
certain
PATRICK
Am I dead
COLT

We’re all dead

WORTHINGTON
Every warrior every soldier every
man killed in battle is here lad

PATRICK
How do I get out

HILL

Patrick jerks Hill silent looks to McKee--
MCKEE
Think about it What’s the last

thing you remember

Patrick collects his thoughts for a beat

PATRICK
It was a combat jump We were
outnumbered Overrun
(beat)
I was hit

The memories trickle back Patrick lowers the knife Hill
slips free draws a pistol on Patrick

PATRICK
--and now I’m here

SHOTS RING OUT The men turn to see hundreds of SOLDIERS
step out of the surrounding woodline The soldiers are
diverse from different eras different wars

They cautiously approach with GUNS RAISED--

SOLDIER 1
Drop your weapons

The LEAD SOLDIER takes aim of Hill

SOLDIER 1
I said drop it now

Hill drops the gun raises his hands

HILL
I told ya we shudda kept movin’

EXT THE CITADEL - NIGHT

Patrick and the men are led out of the forest and into an
open valley In the distance HUNDREDS OF BARB WIRE LADEN
TRENCHES spread across the front of a FORTRESS built into a
mountainside

PATRICK
Jesus What the hell is that

This is the CITADEL It lies in a perfect defensive
position the only approach through this valley

The HIGH WALLS of the Citadel run the entire length of the
mountainside Hundreds of TORCHES burn atop them A SET OF
COLOSSAL GATES at their center the sole entrance within
EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES

HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS line the high walls

SIR WILLIAM AARONDALE an aged knight wearing tarnished chain
mail and a broadsword appears above the gates He strokes
his haggard beard as his wild eyes examine the new arrivals

AARONDALE
What do we have here

SOLDIER 1
Sir Aarondale we picked them up
while in pursuit of the retreating
Mongols

AARONDALE
Is that so Who leads these men

Moore stumbles forward pushing his way to the front

MOORE

Uh that would be me sir Captain
David Moore Got a little turned
around out there Um but we got
our bearings now We’1l just be on
our way

(beat)
Thank you

(beat)
Uh which way was is west again

Aarondale is not amused

AARONDALE
Bring them inside

The Citadel’s HEAVY GATES slowly swing open
EXT THE CITADEL - COURTYARD

They are led through where HUNDREDS OF SOLDIERS spanning the
history of combat have gathered around a towering HANGMAN’S
GALLOWS Vikings Conquistadors Bolsheviks Imperial
Japanese Nazis-- the mix is as diverse as it is eclectic

A MASKED HANGMAN holds a MONGOL PRISONER atop the gallows
Patrick and the men are stopped at the base of the stairs

AARONDALE
They shall bear witness

Aarondale ascends the gallows staircase

AARONDALE
(to crowd)
The incessant violence will end
(MORE)

AARONDALE (CONTD)
The chain that has damned us to
this God forsaken land will be
broken

The Mongol’s hands are bound and a NOOSE is TIGHTENED around
his neck Aarondale steps to the edge of the gallows--

AARONDALE
For those who tread the path of
death and destruction this is
their fate
(to Mongol)

You have been found guilty of
crimes against your fellow man
The penalty for which is death

Aarondale signals A LEVER is pulled dropping the Mongol
through a TRAP DOOR His neck snaps and FIRE BELLOWS out of
the GALLOWS catching the slack rope ABLAZE

The crowd CHEERS

AARONDALE
Bring me the Ranger

Surrounded by Guards a LONE SOLDIER with his hands shackled
behind his back is escorted through the mob to the base of
the gallows

This guy has special forces written all over him A strict
high and tight chiseled jaw and hyper focused stare He
carries himself like a man who’s seen it all The name on
his Vietnam era uniform reads SMOKLER but he goes by “Smoke”

As the guards lead Smoke to the stairs he sees Patrick does
a double take He looks Patrick up and down as he climbs the
gallows He can’t take his eyes off of him

A FRESH NOOSE is readied as they reach the top

SMOKE
For me You shouldn’t have

The guards place Smoke over the TRAP DOOR

AARONDALE
The incessant violence will end
The chain that has damned us to
this God forsaken land will be
broken For those who tread the
path of death

SMOKE
Not guilty

A lone CHUCKLE comes from the crowd Smoke smiles

AARONDALE
This isn’t a trial

The hangman reaches for the noose

SMOKE
It ain’t much of a hanging either

Smoke SPINS and KICKS the trap door lever sending him and
the hangman into the gallows below

AARONDALE
Stop him

Smoke lands on his feet surrounded by the network of timbers
that support the gallows

Soldiers rush to the base of the gallows and OPEN FIRE The
shots hit the hangman He BURSTS INTO FLAMES Smoke bounds
over and through the timbers

AARONDALE
Hold your fire Take him alive

Soldiers rush under the gallows after him Smoke leaps from
support to support evading their grasp navigating his way
out

He leaps to the ground below landing right next to Patrick
He is instantly encircled but fights fiercely Smoke uses
their numbers to his advantage riding the momentum of two
men to take down three others

Smoke’s ferocity has driven the circle outward The soldiers
hesitate entry into the ring but Smoke has run out of steam

He drops to his knees still egging them on

SMOKE
Had enough

One of Aarondale’s men aims his rifle at Smoke Patrick
KICKS THE RIFLE from his hands as it FIRES into the air

The soldier next to Patrick swings the butt of his rifle and
KNOCKS him unconscious Patrick drops to the ground

AARONDALE
That’s enough

Aarondale’s order stops the melee He looks down at Patrick

AARONDALE
Well I’1ll be damned

He makes his way down from the gallows for a better look

AARONDALE
Take them all to the brig
(re Patrick)
I want a talk with this one

INT THE CITADEL - BRIG - LATER

Aged IRON CELLS line the inside of a dank torch lit brig
The men have been divided and locked up Hill hangs from
the window bars peering outside

MOORE
I’1l sort all this out

HILL
Sure ya will Dida bang up job
out yonder
(mocking)
Which way was west

HILL’S POV--

In the courtyard below he sees the gallows being fitted with
fresh NOOSES

BACK TO SCENE--
Hill drops back down

HILL
They’re fixin’ more

Patrick wakes up in his cell at the far end of the brig

HILL
(to Patrick)
Mornin’ Peaches Nice work out

put your nose where it don’t belong
and got us locked up

COLT
Leave him alone Hill He’s all
crossed up

HILL
Fuck you Doc You forget he just
hadda knife to my throat

Gawonii sits quietly in the corner of his cell He mutters
under his breath Even in Cherokee it’s clear it was an
insult

HILL
Na na na There he goes again
What’d he just say Colt what he
say

COLT
He said the only thing keeping him
from breaking you in half right now
is that there would then be two of
you around

Gawonni cracks a smile

HILL
Stick an’ stones Gawonni Sticks
an’ stones

WORTHINGTON
Id say that is quite enough out of
you blokes

Patrick shakes off the cobwebs Smoke casually leans against
the bars of the cell next to him looks him up and down

SMOKE
I know you

PATRICK
Yeah I’m the guy who just saved
your ass

SMOKE
Saved my ass I had that situation
totally under control Everything
was going according to plan and
then you had to step in

PATRICK
Oh really Did you plan include
getting your head blown off while
you were on you knees

SMOKE
Touché But seriously you look
familiar

The brig door CLANKS open and TWO GUARDS enter stopping at
Patrick’s cell

GUARD 1
You let’s go

Smoke sticks his head through the bars--

SMOKE
Hey good chat Give my regards to
Aarondale

INT THE CITADEL - AARONDALE’S CHAMBERS

Patrick is thrown into a TORCH LIT CHAMBER the door locked
behind him A table sits in the center of the room Relics
from throughout time are scattered about

A medieval Smithsonian of sorts

Patrick looks out a window He’s in a tower hundreds of feet
above the courtyard There’s no way out

The door UNLOCKS Flanked by his guards Aarondale strides
in and draws his broadsword He drops the heavy blade on the
table in front of him A DETAILED COAT OF ARMS is etched
into hilt of the polished blade

AARONDALE
Leave us

The guard steps outside locking the two men in
AARONDALE

Why did you intervene on the behalf
of the Ranger

PATRICK
You did give an order to take him
alive

AARONDALE

Indeed Give me your name
Patrick doesn’t answer
AARONDALE
You can answer my questions and

make this easy

Aarondale’s iron glove grips the hilt of his sword

AARONDALE
»--Or not

Aarondale deftly brings the blade to Patrick’s neck Nothing
from Patrick not even a flinch With the flick of a wrist
Aarondale flips the dog tags out of Patrick’s shirt and cuts
them loose

They fall onto the table Aarondale examines them
AARONDALE
Patrick Nathan Junior How long

have you been here

PATRICK
Where exactly is here

AARONDALE
There is no simple answer to that
question

PATRICK
So I’ve heard

Patrick takes note of his armor

PATRICK

Looks like you’ve been here awhile
AARONDALE

It was a much different place then

(beat)
Sit
Patrick sits

AARONDALE

We were brought here for a larger
purpose for a battle yet to come
Instead that battle has become one
amongst ourselves

Aarondale leans in close his eyes examining Patrick’s face

AARONDALE
The real war is coming Nathan
Patrick Jr A war against an
unimaginable enemy A war that
must unite us all

Aarondale goes to the chamber window and his gaze falls upon
the black mountain range to the north

AARONDALE
Beyond the Northern Lines is where
it all begins Forces are now
mobilizing to lay siege on this
fortress They will come from
beyond those black peaks

Aarondale turns back to Patrick

AARONDALE
Something evil festers there
growing stronger We’ve seen signs
that the battle will very soon be

upon us
PATRICK

Why are you telling me this
AARONDALE

Come with me I have something to

show you
INT THE CITADEL - CORRIDOR
Aarondale leads Patrick deep within the Citadel

AARONDALE

I have descended from a long line
of warriors My father died
gloriously on the field of battle
I was too young to remember the
first time but I had the honor of
being by his side when he was
struck down again

(beat)
Here

Ahead is a HEAVILY GUARDED BARRICADE sandbags and barbed
wire block a LONG CORRIDOR that disappears into darkness
ARMED GUARDS make way as they pass

Patrick is drawn to the coat of arms on the hilt of
Aarondale’s sword

AARONDALE
(off Patrick’s stare)

This belonged to my father and his
father before him It has been
passed down for generations It
has seen battles that you could
only imagine

(MORE)

AARONDALE (CONTD)
With this sword my father
commanded the Citadel and he died
defending it God willing so will
I

Aarondale looks to Patrick knowing

AARONDALE
And what of you Patrick Your
lineage

Patrick instinctively reaches into his pocket pulling out
his FATHER’S DOG TAGS

PATRICK
My father was a soldier

They reach a pair of SIMPLE WOODEN DOORS at end of the
corridor

AARONDALE
This I already knew

INT THE CITADEL - CHAMBER

The doors open and Patrick is overwhelmed by the sight a
MASSIVE CHAMBER hidden within the mountain An epic space
smooth rock polished to a brilliant SHIMMER perfection in
stark contrast to the rest of this miserable land

At the far end SEVEN STEPS rise to a pair of GIGANTIC DOORS

PATRICK
What is this place

Aarondale crosses to a large STONE PEDESTAL at the chamber’s
center

AARONDALE
For thousands of years a
brotherhood of knights were charged
with the Citadel’s defenses

Aarondale points to an odd shaped depression carved into the
center of the pedestal Something is missing

AARONDALE
A knight of our own betrayed us and
stole the key

PATRICK
A key A key for what

AARONDALE
For those doors Once that key is
placed into this pedestal it opens
a gateway back to the living world
It is through this gateway the army
of Hell must pass to bring the
foretold Apocalypse

Patrick stands in awe in front of the giant doors He gazes
around the chamber and sees carvings of four demonic
horsemen arching towards the doors

PATRICK
So there’s a way out of here

AARONDALE
It’s not that simple Patrick

PATRICK
Of course not

AARONDALE
The traitor raised an army in an
attempt to take the Citadel His
desire was to use the gateway to
return to the living world Our
forces clashed at the Old Field
The fighting waged for months few
survived In the end the knight
escaped and took refuge in the most
dangerous region of this land the
Northern Lines One man stepped
forward vowing to pursue and
retrieve the key no matter what the
cost A bold and headstrong soul
just like you

Aarondale tosses Patrick’s dog tags back He holds them in
one hand and his father’s in the other

AARONDALE
His name was Colonel Nathan
Patrick Your father

An ALARM RINGS out in the courtyard One of Aarondale’s
guards bursts into the chamber

GUARD 1
Sir

He rushes to Aarondale’s side whispers to him Clearly bad
news
AARONDALE
(to guard)
Get him back to the brig

PATRICK
What Wait Where is he

AARONDALE

No He hasn’t been seen since

INT THE CITADEL - BRIG

Two guards drag in Patrick As one unlocks his

cell Patrick

SPINS AND LANDS A ROUNDHOUSE KICK to the other knocking him

unconscious

The other guard pulls his sidearm
bars and CHOKES HIM OUT

SMOKE
Get the keys

Moore and Worthington jump to their feet

MOORE
What the hell are you doing

PATRICK
You need to take me to the Northern
Lines

MOORE
The Northern Lines

HILL
Woohoo You are plum outta yer

WORTHINGTON
I would strongly advise against
this Patrick The Northern Lines
are fraught with peril

MOORE
Why would you of all people need
to go to the Northern Lines

Patrick won’t answer

Smoke reaches through the

Patrick takes the keys from the guard’s belt and goes to
Moore’s cell He hesitates before unlocking it
MCKEE

The Northern Lines are a no man’s
land The journey alone will most
likely kill you No one has ever

returned from there
(beat)
No one

PATRICK
Ill go on my own then

SMOKE (0S)

Patrick crosses to Smoke’s cell

SMOKE

Let me out and I’1ll get you there

I give you my word

MOORE

SMOKE
(to Moore)
Do I know you

tosses them at Smoke’s feet

PATRICK

Smoke reluctantly shackles his own hands

MOORE

WORTHINGTON
Do you know what you are saying
Doc
COLT

We stand a better chance out there

than we do against those gallows
(to Patrick)

And you’re gonna need some help

just gettin’ past those walls

EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL - NIGHT
Aarondale’s MEN rush to the wall and take aim

AARONDALE
What’s going on

One of the guards points to the distant woodline Aarondale
squints trying to make out a FIGURE in the mist

A LONE CONFEDERATE SOLDIER comes running out of the woods at
full speed He runs straight toward the Citadel racing over
the planks and under the barbed wire that span the trenches

Aarondale steps to the wall orders a nearby SNIPER--

AARONDALE
Shoot him

The sniper takes a knee and brings an eye to his scope
tracks his target

Aarondale turns back to the woodline just as HUNDREDS OF
CONFEDERATES break out of the forest A tattered “SOUTHERN
CROSS” leads their charge They rush across the valley at
full speed

AARONDALE
Bedford
(to the sniper)
Hold your fire
(then to others)
Secure the gates

INT THE CITADEL - OUTSIDE THE BRIG

Patrick and the men rush out of the brig into a surprisingly
empty corridor

Gawonii runs over to the nearby weapons locker kicking the
door off He quickly hands out weapons pulling out a
SAMURAI SWORD--

COLT
Whose is this

Smoke snaps the sword from Gawonii’s hand

SMOKE
That would be me

PATRICK
Which way

SMOKE
Follow me

MOORE
Oh no we are not

Smoke runs down the corridor The men follow leaving Moore
behind

MOORE
following him

EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES

Hoards of CONFEDERATES gather at the gates They look battle
weary on edge Fear is etched in their eyes--

BEDFORD (0S)
Make way

The crowd parts for a pair of worn knee-high patent leather
boots CONFEDERATE GENERAL BEDFORD strides to the gates
armed with a CEREMONIAL SABER and a SILVER REVOLVER

BEDFORD
Aarondale Aarondale

EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL

Aarondale appears atop the gates flanked by HUNDREDS OF MEN
with their weapons trained on the Confederates

BEDFORD
Aarondale You best be opening
these God-damn gates before I knock
‘em down

AARONDALE
Not for you Bedford

BEDFORD
(turning to his men)
Boys
The Confederates take aim

EXT THE CITADEL - COURTYARD

Smoke leads the men to the base of the gallows The
courtyard is deserted

SMOKE
Something’s not right

They can see the gates from their vantage point Moore
notices that they are unguarded He makes a break for it

MOORE
Let’s go

Smoke tries to stop Moore

SMOKE
Wait

It’s too late the rest of the men follow Moore Smoke goes
after them

EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL

Aarondale’s men are in a tense standoff with the Confederates
below when the gates open--

AARONDALE
I said secure those gates

EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES

The main gates OPEN Patrick and the men rush out only to
find their escape blocked the hoard of Confederates The

gates QUICKLY CLOSE behind them Everyone looks at Moore

MOORE
Damn

The Confederates react with rifles raised

SMOKE
Youve got to be kidding

Bedford spots Hill in the crowd smiles
BEDFORD
Well well well What do we have
here
He draws his saber and lifts it to Hill’s throat
BEDFORD
Thought we wouldn’t find you boy
I don’t take kindly to deserters

Hill stiffens up unafraid

AARONDALE
Sheath your blade Bedford

Bedford pushes the tip of his sword into Hill’s throat
Blood trickles out

BEDFORD
Open the doors or your man will
die

AARONDALE

He’s not one of my men
Hill raises his brow confirming the truth

BEDFORD
Damn don’t nobody want you boy

Bedford holds his blade steady He commands with his free
hand pointing at Patrick and the others

BEDFORD
Are these your men

AARONDALE
Afraid not

BEDFORD
You’re a God-damn liar

MOORE
They’re my men

BEDFORD

And who the fuck are you
MOORE

Captai
BEDFORD

I don’t give a shit I’m going to
kill all of ‘em on principle at
this point
Bedford draws his revolver and COCKS the HAMMER BACK

AARONDALE
Bedford this is your last warning

BEDFORD
Aarondale you don’t understand

Bedford changes tact

BEDFORD
Please let us in

CONFEDERATE SOLDIER
General Bedford they’re coming
through
Bedford reels back looking to the woodline
EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL
Aarondale also turns For a moment nothing Then--
THE TREES BURST INTO FLAMES
AARONDALE
(sotto)
They weren’t attacking they were

retreating

The edge of the forest burns like a lit fuse splitting into
SIX CHANNELS OF FLAME heading directly toward the Citadel

EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES
McKee sees the approaching blaze

MCKEE
Look

The men turn and see the woods burning

MOORE
What is it

BEDFORD
Into the trenches

The Confederates scatter into the trench system leaving
Patrick and the others at the gates Smoke holds out his
shackled wrists

SMOKE
Patrick unlock my hands

Patrick pulls out the guard’s key ring There are HUNDREDS
OF KEYS

SMOKE
Shit Give ‘em to me

EXT THE CITADEL - WOODLINE

The woodline ERUPTS INTO FLAMES as SIX FIRE SOLDIERS blast
into the open field They’re armed with machine guns and
fiery shields

They charge toward the trenches

EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES

Moore sees the charging Fire Soldiers his jaw drops

MOORE
Holy shit

Smoke grabs Patrick they dive into a trench full of
Confederates

WORTHINGTON
Into the trenches

Worthington and the others dive into another trench
EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL
Aarondale’s soldiers exchange worried looks

SOLDIER
Sir

AARONDALE
Wait for my command
(under his breath)
Let’s see what they can do

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

Bedford marches through the trench system and raises his
sword into the air He’s the ONLY MAN IN THE OPEN

BEDFORD
On my command

The Confederates raise their muskets machine guns and small
arms from the trenches in unison

BEDFORD
Ready

The Fire Soldiers continue to advance

BEDFORD
Aim

Bedford stops at the edge of the furthermost trench swiftly
bringing his saber down--

BEDFORD
Fire

A wave of GUNFIRE erupts from the trenches The massive
volley is deflected by the Fire Soldier’s burning shields

The Fire Soldiers raise their weapons and RETURN FIRE Their
bullets are like tracer rounds on steroids

Their aim dead on
The Confederates in the first trench line are hit They fall
like dominoes BUT THEY DON’T BURST INTO FLAMES The bodies

of the soldiers killed by Fire Soldiers remain

BEDFORD
Second volley

EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL

The Fire Soldiers charge unabated decimating the Confederate
forces Aarondale has seen enough

AARONDALE
Anything that moves

Aarondale’s men OPEN FIRE indiscriminately taking shots at
Fire Soldiers and Confederates Bodies and bullets fly in
every direction
44

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

The Confederates panic and abandon the trenches They rush
past Bedford in retreat

BEDFORD
Damn it Get back in line you
yellow bellied bastards

Bedford turns finds himself face to face with one of the
Fire Soldiers Bedford swings his saber slashes cutting
completely through the Fire Soldier severing it in half

Falling to the ground the flames that engulfed it go out

Another Fire Soldier OPENS FIRE behind Bedford hitting him
Falling to his knees Bedford drops his sword and pulls his
revolver He squeezes the trigger

It goes off like a CANNON The shot rips through the Fire
Soldier’s chest but it doesn’t go down The Fire Soldier
lowers its BLAZING BAYONET and charges IMPALING Bedford

Patrick jumps from his trench rushes to the fallen General

SMOKE
What the hell are you doing

Patrick FIRES a blast of machine gun fire hitting the Fire
Soldier that just killed Bedford A head shot it’s SKULL

EXPLODES The burning body drops to the ground lifeless

Patrick drops to a knee checks Bedford-- he’s dead

Smoke sees two Fire Soldiers close on Patrick He climbs out
of the trench still flipping through the KEYS--

SMOKE
Cmon

Frantically searching for the right key--

SMOKE
Ah fuck it

Smoke tosses the keys to the ground He fumbles with a
rifle trying to get a hold with his shackled hands--

SMOKE
Behind you

Patrick rolls out of the line of fire Smoke drops to his
back lifts the rifle with his feet and PULLS THE TRIGGER
Emptying the clip the two Fire Soldiers fall dead

Suddenly the last two Fire Soldiers POP OUT OF THE TRENCH
directly behind Smoke He’s defenseless flat on the ground

Worthington and the others jump from their trench and unload
their weapons taking out one The other leaps into the air
and blind sides Patrick knocking him to the ground

It stands directly over him BAYONET poised to strike when--
Aarondale’s broadsword streaks in like a missile and smashes
into the last Fire Soldier The blade’s impact obliterates
it sending burning bits of flesh and bone into the air

The sword impales the ground inches from Patrick’s head
EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL

The broadsword has ended the battle Aarondale is flanked by
hundreds of his soldiers their rifles now trained on Patrick
and the others

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

Patrick is slow to his feet as Smoke surveys the battlefield--

SMOKE
Now this is a first

PATRICK

Smoke points over the trenches BODIES of dead Confederates
are littered everywhere

SMOKE
Bodies

Worthington kneels over one of the dead Fire Soldiers

MOORE
What the hell are they

Worthington looks at its uniform-- A JAPANESE INFANTRY MAN

one is a FRENCH SOLDIER from the Revolutionary war

COLT

McKee flips over another

MCKEE

Patrick kneels down for a closer look One of the dead Fire
Soldiers has the same uniform as his own

MCKEE
Isn’t that your guy
Patrick sees tattoos on the soldier’s knuckles A HEART A
DIAMOND A CLUB AND A SPADE Patrick warily rolls the body
over It’s the charred mutilated remains of Forte

PATRICK
Yeah Yeah it is

Patrick turns to Aarondale’s broadsword still stuck in the
ground He goes to the sword placing his hand on the hilt
He looks up to Aarondale atop the wall

EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL

Aarondale is focused on the distant MOUNTAIN RANGE to the
north The AMBER HORIZON past the mountains grows darker

AARONDALE
(to his soldiers)
Fortify defences and prepare for a
siege

He shifts his gaze to Patrick at the sword his hand still
hesitating on the hilt--

--Aarondale nods
EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

Patrick pulls the heavy blade from the ground He turns to
find the men watching him

Lowering the blade to his side Patrick silently moves out

EXT THE OLD FIELD - NIGHT - LATER

Patrick and the men march solemnly across a blackened field
littered with thousands of WEAPONS AND HELMETS driven into
the ground The remnants of a massive battle slashed and
burned in the heat of combat

Smoke is at the lead his hands still shackled Patrick
sheaths Aarondale’s sword at his side catches up to him

PATRICK
Jesus what the hell happened here

SMOKE
Just another pointless battle

Patrick turns back to see Moore and Hill following closely
behind They WHISPER glancing at him

SMOKE
Hey kid what’s so important about
the Northern Lines

Patrick won’t say

SMOKE
Fine keep your little secrets

This time Smoke turns to see Moore and Hill still plotting

hillside

Something spooking ya chief

Gawonii glares at Smoke Not amused

EXT HILLSIDE BRUSH

A HOODED FIGURE lowers a high powered M-40 sniper rifle from
their shoulder and disappears into the underbrush

EXT A TREACHEROUS AND DAUNTING ROUTE - NIGHT

Patrick and the men march It’s slow going Patrick’s eyes
focus on the looming and ominous MOUNTAIN RANGE to the north

Smoke keeps glancing to the surrounding hills

PATRICK
You sure you know where you’re
going

Smoke is incredulous

SMOKE
I know exactly where I’m going
(to himself)

Moore and Hill quickly raise their rifles and point them at
the group

Stop right there

Patrick raises his rifle in defense

Why I want to know Tell me
what is so God-damn important
about the Northern Lines

Out of the corner of his eye Moore sees Smoke raising his
shackled hands above his head

MOORE
-and what the hell are you doing

A SHOT rings out A bullet strikes the shackles and Smoke’s
hands are free He sweeps Moore’s feet out from under him

A second SHOT knocks the rifle out of Hill’s hands

Smoke goes for the rifle but he’s stopped by the cold sting
of steel Patrick wields Aarondale’s blade to his neck

PATRICK
Going somewhere

The SNIPER emerges from the brush in a HOODED COLONIAL ERA
UNIFORM and carrying an M-40 SNIPER RIFLE still trained on
Patrick

Pulling the hood back a shock of long black hair tumbles
down The sniper is a WOMAN her name is DONNELLAN A black
widow ravishing on the outside but don’t let her beauty fool
you She’s all killer on the inside

HILL
A girl Ain’t no girl can shoot
for shit

Donnellan quick draws a pistol FIRES The shot knocks the
cap from Hill’s head He’s stunned He picks it up dusts
it off and fingers the bullet hole--

others--

EXT MARSHLAND - NIGHT

Donnellan leads the way through a simmering marsh They slog
through the thick scorched underbrush carefully navigating

around small POOLS OF FIRE that FLARE UP without warning

The further they have traveled the more menacing the
landscape has grown

The pace has slowed the men are tired
WORTHINGTON
If I may I believe it would be
best if we caught our breath for a
moment

The rest of the men follow suit

DONNELLAN
Fine We’1ll catch our breath

Colt and Gawonii drop in next to Patrick Gawonii speaks in
Cherokee to Colt motioning to Patrick Colt shakes his head
but Gawonii insists

COLT
Hey Patrick Not that we’re
having second thoughts or anything

lost after some battle at a field
or in a field

Smoke overhears interrupts--

SMOKE
The Old Field The battle was at
The Old Field

PATRICK
What do you know about it

Smoke ignores the question joins Donnellan

PATRICK
He said this key is supposed to
open the gateway back to the living
world

Colt perks up gets serious

COLT
You know I’ve heard that story
before We’ve all heard it
Wonder if it’s true

HILL (0S8)
Hell no it ain’t

Hill hollers across the marsh at Colt--

HILL
If there’s some key that’ll open up
this here world to the next Id
a left all yer sorry asses by now
Now shut up I’m tryin’ to catch
some shut eye

Hill rolls to his side pulling his cap down

PATRICK
What’s his problem

COLT
Hill Oh don’t you worry about
him Been in a shit mood ever
since he got here He’s alright
though just takes some getting
used to Hell what happened to
him happen to me I gather I’d be
a might pissed off too

PATRICK
What happened

COLT
Every war has a last man to die
Short time after he got here he
comes to find out that in his
war it was him

PATRICK
Tough luck

Gawonii interrupts He speaks directly to Patrick as Colt
translates for him

COLT
(translating)
He says it’s got nothing to do with
luck Hill was needed and the
spirits brought him here

PATRICK
I don’t think any spirits brought
me here

Gawonii is pensive Colt continues --

COLT
(translating)
Youre wrong The spirits are
wise They have summoned me to
this place and they will reveal my
purpose when the time is right
They’1l do the same for you

There is a moment of silence as Patrick considers Gawonii’s
words It’s interrupted by Moore striding to the center of
the marsh--

MOORE
(proclamation)
We’re staying here for the night

Donnellan marches over to Moore

DONNELLAN
We can’t stay here
MOORE
(to Smoke)
Put a muzzle on this bitch will
ya
DONNELLAN

Excuse me

Smoke has to restrain her She pulls away and stomms off
Smoke goes after her

MOORE
We’re staying

LATER-—
Hill and Worthington huddle around one of the pools of fire

Patrick sees Donnellan across the camp He catches her eye
and smiles--

--she gives him the FINGER

MCKEE (0S)
Making more friends I see

Patrick looks up to see McKee

MCKEE
Would you like some company

McKee pulls the Bible out of his pack

PATRICK
No sermon for me father
MCKEE
Oh God no I wouldn’t waste your

time
McKee places his Bible on the wet ground and sits on it

MCKEE
At least it’s good for something

Patrick points skyward--

PATRICK
Don’t let him hear you say that

MCKEE
I don’t think he’s listening

Patrick and McKee sit in silence for a moment

PATRICK

Mack mind if I ask you something
MCKEE

Shoot
PATRICK

Do you really think Aarondale is
right The gateway and the four
horsemen The end of the living
world Our purpose

MCKEE
I don’t know Look I don’t have
any answers here Nothing to guide
me When they were writing the
Good Book they left this part out
All this world knows is war
killing and death

McKee looks around at the rest of his squad settling in for
the night

MCKEE
I spent my life giving Last Rites
to men just like these soldiers
dying on the battlefield I’d look
into their eyes and see the fear
and uncertainty of what came next
It was my job to bring them comfort
in their final moments I assured
them that they were going to a
better place But this isn’t what
I had in mind The only thing I
fear more than this place is what
Hell comes next

PATRICK
Amen to that

McKee stands up and brushes his Bible off

MCKEE
Yes Amen

The draw of MUSICAL STRINGS eases through the marsh Hill
carefully slides a FIDDLE and BOW from his pack He plucks a
few notes then pulls the bow across the strings

The off key note becomes a ballad When he plays he’s a
different man Eloquent

The MUSIC washes over the camp A moment of introspection a
moment of peace

The SONG transitions DARKLY
DISSOLVE TO
EXT DREAM SEQUENCE - FIERY GRAVEYARD

A hellish graveyard A labyrinth of burning tombstones all
around Patrick parachutes in He rolls to the ground and
sheds the chute In full battle gear he scrambles for cover
behind a blazing tombstone

There is no one else here Cautiously he moves forward In
the distance a single coffin sits prepared for burial He
breathes heavy creeps closer

The scene is familiar - his father’s burial Patrick inches
closer still

Reaching the coffin Patrick touches the lid slowly lifting
Colonel Patrick lies inside Peaceful

Suddenly the Colonel’s eyes SNAP open He’s instantly out
of the coffin and snatches Patrick by the neck lifts him
from the ground

COLONEL PATRICK
Nathan

Woooosh The Colonel ignites going up in a ball of flames
He pulls his son in tight face to face His flesh bubbling
sluffing off the bone

Patrick struggles against his father trying to break free
His own flesh catching fire

COLONEL PATRICK
Turn back Now

PATRICK
(screaming)
Nooooo

EXT MARSHLAND - NIGHT

A HAND slaps over Patrick’s mouth His eyes snap open to
find Hill over him with a KNIFE

HILL
(quietly)
Shhhhhhh

Hill brings the knife to Patrick’s face Patrick eyes the
BLADE Closer Closer Then it moves past his face and
points into the marsh

HILL
Yonder

Hill removes his hand The soft SNAP of a branch echoes
Then another

Patrick scans the marsh and sees SILHOUETTES shifting from
tree to tree

Suddenly a BARRAGE OF ARROWS fly in

HILL
Ambush

A pack of MONGOL WARRIORS rush out of marsh from all sides
Everyone is quick to their weapons

MOORE
We’re surrounded

WORTHINGTON
Colt Left flank

Colt turns and FIRES a LAW ROCKET LAUNCHER The Mongol
Warriors EXPLODE INTO FLAMES as they are blown to pieces

Patrick clicks off the safety on his M-16 and gets to a knee
He sees a Mongol drawing down on McKee

PATRICK
Mack move

McKee rolls out of the way as Patrick FIRES and the Mongol
BURSTS INTO FLAMES Patrick scans the marsh both Donnellan
and Smoke are missing

PATRICK
Where the hell is Smoke

Gawonii HURLS HIS TOMAHAWK through the air It strikes a
Mongol closing in on Hill

HILL
He done ran off

MOORE
I knew it

They’re outnumbered Mongols are everywhere The men FIRE
at everything that moves Hill runs out of ammo

HILL
I’m out

Suddenly a MONGOL DARTS OUT OF THE MARSH and swings his axe
for Hill’s head

MCKEE
Hill

Hill spins and sees the Mongol It’s too late He braces
for the blow when--

BAM BAM BAM The Mongol EXPLODES INTO FLAMES Hill reels
around to see Patrick standing center in the marsh smoking
rifle in hand

A Mongol is behind Patrick broadsword poised to strike

DONNELLAN (0S)
Get down

Smoke and Donnellan surge in with WEAPONS ABLAZE

Donnellan pushes Patrick to the ground She blocks the sword
thrust with her rifle then DRIVES A KNIFE into the Mongol’s
throat She kicks the Mongol back into a pool of fire just
as it ERUPTS vaporizing him

Moore trips and falls to the ground A Mongol is right on
top of him sword above his head

Smoke quick draws his samurai sword braking it inches from
the Mongol’s neck The Mongol freezes

The two look intently at each other neither willing to give
an inch Smoke flashes a smile The Mongol relaxes lowers
his sword and takes a step backwards

Smoke sheathes his blade

Slowly the Mongol drifts back leading the other enemy
warriors back into the marsh

Donnellan pushes Smoke aside and pulls Moore to his feet
DONNELLAN
We’re leaving now Is that okay

with you Captain

EXT ROAD MARCH - NIGHT

The men march in silence silhouetted against the FLASHING
NORTHERN HORIZON Random distant EXPLOSIONS and GUNFIRE
reverberate through the air

Suddenly the horizon erupts MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS and FLASHES
STROBE in a constant exchange of fire The flickering light
reflects in the men’s eyes

SMOKE
Whoa

In an instant the EXPLOSIONS STOP The horizon SURGES DEEP
RED then falls into complete darkness

DONNELLAN
Let’s keep moving

EXT NORTHERN LINES - HILLSIDE - DAWN

A blackened dawn breaks The men stand atop a hillside
looking down in awe They’ve reached the NORTHERN LINES--

--and they’re completed destroyed

The Lines stretch as far as the eye can see from one end of
the horizon to the other A labyrinth of sandbag and barbed
wire laden trenches thousands or more twisting and turning
in seemingly endless directions

Bunkers and positions are burning spewing thick clouds of
black smoke

Along the perimeter bellied up to the wire thousands upon
thousands of BODIES lie smoldering in what appears to be a
final stand

COLT
Oh my God

MCKEE
I don’t think so

With weapons at the ready they fan out slowly sweeping the
smouldering base

EXT NORTHERN LINES - BUNKER

Donnellan and Smoke stand over a burned-out bunker SCORCHED
CORPSES are piled inside

DONNELLAN
Bodies

Smoke nods cautiously scanning the area

DONNELLAN
Smoke what did this

SMOKE
It’s gotta be those things we
fought at the Citadel The Fire
Soldiers
Smoke snaps the bolt on his rifle

SMOKE
Be ready

EXT NORTHERN LINES - TRENCH LINE

McKee carefully navigates through the DEAD stacked at his
feet

He stops at the sight of a DEAD WARRIOR frozen in his final
position burnt to a crisp On a knee a rifle tucked under
one arm and the other pointing at an unseen enemy

His mouth agape eyes wide fear forever charred onto his
face McKee solemnly removes his helmet

Patrick stands center in a sea of dead searching the field
for any sign of life-- any sign of his father

EXT NORTHERN LINES - AT THE WIRE

Hill and Colt are at the wire roaming through the carnage
stripping ammunition from the dead

Colt kneels at the side of a CORPSE wearing a GRENADE BELT
He unclasps the string of grenades

Moore tugs Worthington aside WHISPERS--

MOORE
We should go Now

Worthington pulls himself free If anything the destruction
has enraged him

SMOKE (0S)
Where’s Patrick

Smoke cuts a path right to Worthington

WORTHINGTON
I don’t know

Donnellan moves to the wire inspecting the dead The mix of
soldiers blurs the line of friend and enemy The CHARRED
CORPSES lie shoulder to shoulder their weapons all pointed
in the same direction

DONNELLAN
They were fighting together

She looks out past the lines A CHARRED SWATH cuts through
the battlefield and disappears into the DARK MOUNTAIN RANGE

EXT NORTHERN LINES - TRENCH LINE

Patrick frantically looks through the dead searching for his
father

WORTHINGTON
Chap’s gone mad

McKee and Colt try to pull Patrick back from the edge

MCKEE
Patrick

Patrick ignores the call

COLT
Patrick

Moore steps in thinks he knows how to handle this-—-

MOORE
Patrick he’s dead Look around
They’re all dead You’re out of
your fuckin’ mind

Patrick goes ballistic grabs Moore by his collar shoving
his CAPTAIN’S BARS into his face

PATRICK
You don’t deserve these You think
these guys respect you Do you
Instead of running your fuckin’
mouth all the time why don’t you
do something

Patrick lets Moore loose Exasperated he looks around at
this place -- his new world

SMOKE
It’s time to go There’s no way he
survived this

PATRICK
I’m not going anywhere I’m not
giving up He’s here I know he’s
alive and I’m going to find him I
know he is You don’t know him

SMOKE
Yes I do

PATRICK
What

SMOKE

I fought with him at the Old Field

PATRICK
Why didn’t you tell me

SMOKE
Look I fucked up I left your old
man in the lurch Thought if I
could reunite you two then I
don’t know we’d somehow be square
But God-damn-it the Colonel never
saw a fight he didn’t like The
slaughter here has his command
written all over it

The moment lingers Then suddenly-- RED-HOT CHAINS fly out
of the trench One coils around Smoke’s waist burning
through his uniform

Two more wrap up Patrick and Colt All three are yanked into
the trenches

DONNELLAN
Smoke

Before Donnellan can react Fire Soldiers bound from the
trenches and OPEN FIRE She dives for cover

EXT NORTHERN LINES - TRENCH

Patrick slams into the trench floor There are Fire Soldiers
everywhere He quickly draws the broadsword and shatters

the iron chain wrapped around his boot

Freed he draws a pistol

Colt and Smoke are being dragged away Patrick takes careful
aim and FIRES breaking the chain that holds Colt He aims
again for the Fire Soldiers dragging Smoke but they disappear
around a corner

Patrick runs to Colt--

PATRICK
You okay

COLT
Holy shit I think so

PATRICK
They got Smoke Let’s go

EXT NORTHERN LINES - TRENCH LINE
Donnellan is pinned down with Moore

DONNELLAN

Moore is petrified unable to move

DONNELLAN
Moore God damn it Do something

Moore slowly turns to her he can’t

DONNELLAN
Jesus Christ

She takes Moore’s rifle pops up over the wall double-fists
it she UNLOADS knocking down two Fire Soldiers

Donnellan drops down to reload spies Hill and Worthington
pinned down nearby She signals motioning them to drop into
the trench and circle around She counts down with her free
hand--

Five-- four-- three-- two--

Donnellan pops up and OPENS FIRE covering Worthington and
Hill as they drop into the trenches

EXT NORTHERN LINES - IN THE TRENCHES

The Fire Soldiers drag Smoke as Patrick and Colt weave their
way in pursuit

Smoke struggles to break free but can’t He sees Patrick and
Colt and--

SMOKE
Behind you

Patrick and Colt duck as a BARRAGE OF FIERY BULLETS fly in
There are TWO MORE Fire Soldiers behind them

PATRICK
Go Go Go

EXT NORTHERN LINES - ANOTHER TRENCH

Worthington and Hill meet up Worthington directs him
silently They split up each down a trench flanking the
Fire Soldiers above

EXT NORTHERN LINES - IN THE TRENCHES

Patrick and Colt EXCHANGE FIRE as they run Patrick notes
the LAW rocket launcher strapped across Colt’s back

They round one quick corner then another Patrick stops and
pulls Colt into a side trench He wrestles the LAW over
Colt’s head

The pursuing Fire Soldiers rush by Patrick steps into the
trench behind them levels the LAW and FIRES The Fire
Soldiers are blown to bits

EXT NORTHERN LINES - TRENCH LINE

Donnellan bounds from her position guns blazing At the
same time Hill and Worthington come out of the trench behind
the Fire Soldiers catching them off guard

The Fire Soldiers are no match and are cut to pieces

EXT NORTHERN LINES - IN THE TRENCHES

Patrick and Colt are back on Smoke’s trail More twists and
turns then suddenly they stop

The Fire Soldiers with Smoke have hit a dead end When they
turn back they find Patrick and Colt in their path

The first Fire Soldier bounds from the trench and up to the
surface pulling along the chained Smoke

The remaining Fire Soldier meets Patrick and Colt head on
UNLOADING its rifle Patrick and Colt duck behind the trench
walls for cover held at bay

Patrick grabs the grenade belt from Colt pulls one of the
pins and tosses the entire belt around the corner

A massive EXPLOSION The GUNFIRE stops Patrick steps out
rifle raised The smoke settles-- the Fire Soldier is dead

EXT DARK MOUNTAIN RANGE - FOOTHILLS

Patrick and Colt pull themselves to the surface The pursuit
has lead them into the foothills of the dark mountain range
Smoke is gone

COLT
We should go back for the others

Patrick spots a scorched and bloody trail that leads up into
the looming mountains above them

PATRICK
There’s no time

EXT DARK MOUNTAIN RANGE - NIGHT

Patrick and Colt have entered the heart of the beast Deep
within the mountain range the terrain has become slick and
treacherous BLOOD RED CLOUDS roll violently in the sky
They follow the scorched trail as it twists and turms winding
up the mountainside The path narrows and finally ends just
short of the summit

They push to the top

EXT DARK MOUNTAIN RANGE - SUMMIT - NIGHT

Reaching the summit they stand in stunned silence by what
they find on the other side of the mountain--

--they have found the hidden FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT
A DEEP RHYTHMIC BOOMING fills the air as millions of Fire

Soldiers march in formation below A sudden halt they stop
in perfect formation

Patrick and Colt duck for cover Patrick reaches into his
pack pulling out a pair of binoculars

POV BINOCULARS--

In the middle of the encampment a circular formation of Fire
Soldiers Every few seconds a BLAST OF FLAMES erupts from
its center bringing a new Fire Soldier to the ranks

The binoculars scan falling on a group of beaten and bloody
HUMAN SOLDIERS They are huddled together guarded by a row
of Fire Soldiers

Patrick adjusts focus zooms in tighter He finds Smoke

PATRICK (VO)
He’s down there

He pans and stops on another PRISONER
Patrick lowers the binoculars-- looks like he’s seen a ghost

COLT
What’s wrong

Patrick lifts the binoculars adjusts the focus--
POV BINOCULARS--—

--it’s COLONEL PATRICK Beneath the blood and the bruises
he looks exactly as he did in his graveside photo

Patrick searches for an approach A large RAVINE separates
them from the encampment A STEEL WIRE SUSPENSION BRIDGE
spans the ravine

PATRICK
I’m going in

COLT
You’re what

PATRICK
Cover me

Before Colt can respond Patrick grabs his rifle and moves
down the mountainside

EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT - NEAR PRISONERS

Smoke is at the edge of the encampment huddled together with
the group of battered bloodied human prisoners

Wincing he checks the burns around his waist Link shaped
welts are seared deep into his skin Painful but not
mortal

He looks around sizes up his guards plots an escape Then
through the crowd of prisoners he sees the Colonel

SMOKE
Well I’1ll be damned

EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT - SUSPENSION BRIDGE

Patrick crosses underneath the bridge swinging from one
support to another Halfway across a pair of BURNING BOOTS
appear overhead A FIRE SOLDIER on the bridge

Patrick freezes

He remains motionless hanging above the BOTTOMLESS RAVINE
until the Fire Soldier moves on He continues across

EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT - PERIMETER

Reaching the other side Patrick sprints for a nearby rock
formation and takes cover

He’s scanning the terrain looking for a path to Smoke and

his father when the GIANT PILLAR OF FLAME at the center of

the encampment ROARS to life The swirling fires swell and
twist up into the ashen sky

A wave of heat BLASTS over the ranks
THREE DEMONIC HORSEMEN explode from the inferno Atop fiery

steeds they are draped in cloaks that spark electric Each
more fearsome than the last--

The first armed with a FLAMING SWORD-- we’1l call him
MASTEMA His hulking frame bursts at the seams of his battle-
worn armor as he reels in the bucking beast

The second wielding a BATTLE AXE-- we’1ll call him THAMMUZ
His steed black as pitch His gangly body gaunt face
sunken demonic eyes a wretched sight

The third clutching a CROSSBOW-- we’1ll call him MERIHIM

His horse burns white hot The demon’s yellow eyes scan

His lip curls to the side Snarling Smiling He dismounts
and kneels before the pillar lowers his head as--

The FOURTH and final rider blasts through his armor scorched
black His pale stallion rearing up jets of fire spew from
it’s nostrils This is the mightiest of them all--

Well call him VOLAC

He stands in his stirrups and rides between the ranks All
in attendance kneel as he passes

PATRICK
(blown away)
Oh my God

EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT - NEAR PRISONERS

Volac and the Horsemen ride on to the prisoners They survey
their catch with disdain The captive men huddle tighter

Thammuz and Merihim pluck a random PRISONER from the group
drag him away Colonel Patrick rises to his feet tries to
help

Mastema dismounts his steed and KNOCKS the Colonel back to
the ground towers over him GROWLS a warning

Smoke crawls over to the Colonel pulls him back

COLONEL PATRICK
Smoke

SMOKE
Sir

COLONEL PATRICK
Where the hell did you come from

The prisoner struggles as Thammuz and Merihim lash him down
to a stone cross Mastema hovers over the man leans in
nose to nose with him snarls

Volac slides from his saddle marches to the cross and grabs
the prisoner by the neck tearing him free from his bonds

Volac lifts him with one hand as razor-sharp talons extend
from the other He thrusts them into the prisoner’s torso
BLOOD SPRAYS the man SCREAMS

COLONEL PATRICK
Let him go

Volac turns his attention to the Colonel He discards the
prisoner’s body TOSSING it through the air--

The body SMACKS into the rocks Patrick hides behind
splattering blood across his face Wiping the red from his
eyes Patrick finds the Colonel staring directly at him

--THEY LOCK EYES

Patrick levels his rifle tucking it into his shoulder
Colonel Patrick warns him shaking his head The Colonel
mouths silently “No”

Volac stomps into view reaches for the Colonel--

Patrick jumps to his feet but finds himself face to face with
a Fire Soldier and the barrel of its burning rifle

An awkward pause they’re both surprised

PATRICK
Shit

BLAM The Fire Soldier’s head EXPLODES showering Patrick
with BURNING EMBERS

EXT DARK MOUNTAIN RANGE - MOUNTAIN SUMMIT

Donnellan perches on the summit with her eye in the scope of
her sniper rifle--

DONNELLAN
Gottcha

She chambers a fresh round and SQUEEZES the trigger
EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT - NEAR PRISONERS

The Fire Soldiers turn to Patrick their collective color
surges from ORANGE to DEEP RED

Volac LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR landing at Patrick’s feet He
grabs Patrick but is rocked by a barrage of GUNFIRE from the
rear He drops him Patrick rolls clear--

EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT - SUSPENSION BRIDGE

Backup has arrived Worthington and Gawonii lay down a WALL
OF FIRE Colt drops to a knee shoulders his rocket launcher
and FIRES

EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT - NEAR PRISONERS

The SHELL arcs through the air and EXPLODES at Volac’s feet
driving him and the Fire Soldiers back

PATRICK
(turning to the prisoners)
Let’s go

Smoke leads the prisoners running to the bridge Colonel
Patrick stumbles Patrick pulls him back to his feet

PATRICK
Go go go

Volac unleashes the FIRE SOLDIERS in pursuit They OPEN
FIRE Dozens of Colonel Patrick’s men are mowed down

The Colonel hesitates wanting to go back but Patrick jerks
him back into motion running--

COLONEL PATRICK
We have to go back

PATRICK
Negative

COLONEL PATRICK
You’re not in charge here

Patrick pushes the Colonel’s head down OPENS FIRE and knocks
down a Fire Soldier on their flank

PATRICK
Neither are you

EXT FIRE ARMY ENCAMPMENT - SUSPENSION BRIDGE
Hill waits for Worthington’s order--

WORTHINGTON
Blow it

Hill pulls the pins on TWO GRENADES planted in the bridge
supports He breaks for the other side but is shot in the
ass dropping him

Patrick rushes back and picks him up throwing him over his
shoulder--

HILL
Leave me

PATRICK
Not a chance

They dart for the other side as the EXPLOSIVES DETONATE

Pursuing Fire Soldiers are thrown into the ravine The
bridge splits and swings way

Patrick and Hill grab ahold and ride it to the far side of
the ravine slamming into the rock wall Hill tumbles down
but grabs hold of the last rung Patrick reaches for him
Smoke looks down from the edge past them deeper into the
ravine-- countless FIRE SOLDIERS crawl up the ravine wall
like ants

Take my hand

He grabs Hill and pulls them both to the top

COLONEL PATRICK
Get your hands off me

He snatches a sidearm from Hill and jams the barrel under
Smoke’s chin--

COLONEL PATRICK
You disappear from my ranks You
walk away from your men when they
needed you most

A hail of FLAMING GUNFIRE rains in sending everyone ducking
for cover-- except for the Colonel and Smoke

COLONEL PATRICK
You’re a coward I should kill

Gawonii is ahead of Colt and McKee blazing a trail over the
fallen trees and jagged rocks that litter their escape

Gawonii turns back and sees Colt go down The Fiery Viking
closes on him raising the battle axe over its head

Gawonii bounds from the path and up one of the rocky walls
He flips back over McKee and hurls a TOMAHAWK

As the Fiery Viking swings the ax the tomahawk twirls in
striking it right between the eyes the force flipping it
through the air It skids across the rocky ground dead

Gawonii and the burning Spartan circle sizing each other up
Gawonii reaches to the ground runs his fingers through the
soot He draws them across his face-- WAR PAINT

Gawonii pulls his TOMAHAWK out of the dead Viking The
Blazing Spartan pulls its spear from Colt and lunges

cuts through the BURNING SPEAR The Spartan draws a SWORD

The two unleash a blinding series of blows The Spartan’s
SWORD is knocked loose so is Gawonii’s tomahawk

The two fight hand to hand--

Gawonii spins free HEADBUTTS the burning Spartan breaking
off burning flesh and bone He kicks the Spartan in the
chest driving it back

Reaching to his belt Gawonii zips one-- two-- three knives
through the air dropping the Spartan to its knees

It flexes and the BODY SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUSTS It pulls out
the rifle spins the barrel toward the Colonel--

Patrick drops to the ground draws the BROADSWORD and SLICES
the Fire Soldier’s legs off

The torso falls to the ground still reaching for the rifle
Patrick drives the broadsword into the Fire Soldier’s skull
The FLAMES go out

The Colonel sees Aarondale’s broadsword recognizes it

COLONEL PATRICK
How did you get this

PATRICK
I got it from Aarondale He sent
me to the Northern Lines

Patrick extends his hand pulls the Colonel to his feet

PATRICK
to find my father

The Colonel pauses looks closely at Patrick--

COLONEL PATRICK
Your father

KA-FUCKING-BOOM An EXPLOSION blasts an opening at the
sealed off entrance Fire Soldiers claw pry and force their
way through in a demonic frenzy

HILL
These fellers don’t quit

Trapped like rats

PATRICK
Get to the wall

The Colonel Smoke Hill and Patrick rush to the far rock
wall and climb

A second EXPLOSION rips through the entrance-- Fire Solders
pour through GUNS BLAZING

Patrick and the others frantically climb as the barrage of
flaming GUNFIRE hits all around them

The Horsemen push their way through the ranks Volac sees
Patrick on the wall snarls at their impending escape He
extends his talons fire dances on the tips circles in his
palm grows larger hotter-- becoming a giant BALL OF FIRE

Volac launches it

The FIREBALL streaks through the air and impacts just above
Patrick and the others The wall shakes violently The
Colonel loses his grip slides down He stops himself
barely grabbing a new hold

Patrick desperately reaches to him--

PATRICK
Take my hand

The Colonel lets go with one hand but instead of reaching to
Patrick he reaches into his shirt He pulls out a chain
attached to LARGE IRON object--

THE KEY

The Colonel pulls himself up forces the key into Patrick’s
hand

COLONEL PATRICK
Give this to Aarondale

Volac sees the exchange and unleashes another FIREBALL

The impact creates an avalanche of showering rock A loose
boulder skips down the wall and slams into the Colonel
sending him falling He hits the ground hard

PATRICK
No

The Colonel is unconscious but still alive
From the wall Patrick sees the wave of Fire Soldiers close
on the fallen Colonel They push through the pool of water
their collective heat brings it to a boil

Patrick starts down when Smoke grabs him--

PATRICK
I can’t leave him

SMOKE
You have to

The Fire Soldiers reach the Colonel encircling him Volac
snatches him up by the throat

PATRICK
Dad

Volac hesitates Looking up to Patrick he smiles then
throws the Colonel into the sea of Fire Soldiers

PATRICK
No

Smoke forces Patrick to keep climbing

Volac watches as Patrick reaches the top of the wall and
disappears Merihim drags Colonel Patrick in and drops him
at Volac’s feet He’s beaten and bloody but still alive

EXT MARSHLAND - LATER

Donnellan and Worthington have met up with Smoke Patrick
stands alone lost in thought He holds the key his father
gave him

Hill is worked up limping back and forth across the burnt
footing of the marsh

HILL
What are we waiting for Let’s get
outta here

WORTHINGTON
Hill calm down

HILL
(to himself)
Calm down I ain’t gonna fuckin’

DONNELLAN
We’re waiting
HILL
(exploding)
I ain’t listening to you no more

A RUSTLE comes from the marsh Hill spins around weapon at
the ready

McKee and Gawonii enter the clearing Gawonii carrying Colt’s
lifeless body in his outstretched arms

DONNELLAN
Is that

Gawonii only nods

MCKEE
Where’s Moore

Worthington shakes his head
HILL
Yeah He’s fucking dead
(pointing to Donnellan)
Ask the Queen of Sheeba here she
knows

McKee sees Patrick standing alone

MCKEE
The Colonel

He’s answered with silence
Hill looks to Patrick--

HILL
Patrick What do we do now

Patrick stands there coming to terms with his role He
scans the men’s faces

He weighs the key in his hand--

PATRICK

This is what Aarondale was talking

about This is it We have to go

back and defend the Citadel from

the four horsemen

WIPE TO

EXT THE CITADEL - NIGHT
The valley is FILLED WITH SOLDIERS from every corner of this
desolate land The BLOODY AND BEATEN FORCES have retreated
to the perceived safety of the Citadel
EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES
A MOB SCENE soldiers demanding refuge within
Patrick and the others push their way to the front

PATRICK
Aarondale AARONDALE

Aarondale appears at the wall’s edge doesn’t see the Colonel
amongst them

AARONDALE
Did you find him

PATRICK
He’s dead They killed him

AARONDALE
Who killed him

Patrick pulls out the key and holds it high over his head--

PATRICK
Your unimaginable enemy

Aarondale eyes the key in Patrick’s hand
AARONDALE
(under his breath)
He found it
Aarondale steps out of sight and the massive gates OPEN--

EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES

The mob of soldiers rush the opening until the guards strafe
the ground at their feet stopping them in their tracks
CITADEL GUARD
Patrick and your men Inside

EXT THE CITADEL - COURTYARD

A beehive of activity as Aarondale meets Patrick

AARONDALE
How great are their numbers

Patrick almost answers when--

DONNELLAN

You knew about these guys
AARONDALE

How many
SMOKE

Too many
INT THE CITADEL - CORRIDOR

Aarondale leads the way to the barricaded area
the Citadel HEAVILY ARMED GUARDS make way as
leads them down a long corridor

MCKEE
Where did they come from

Aarondale ignores the question Gawonii grabs
tosses him into the corridor wall pinning him
to the throat

WORTHINGTON
What are they

Aarondale can’t break his grip

AARONDALE
we haven’t much time

Patrick pulls Gawonii off--

PATRICK
(to Worthington)
They are us
(to Aarondale)
Soldiers The ones killed here in
this world

AARONDALE
Come with me

deep within
Aarondale

Aarondale and
with a forearm

INT THE CITADEL - CHAMBER

The doors open and the men enter They stand in awe of the
grandeur of the room McKee is transfixed by ARAMAIC LETTERS
carved into the rock above the doors He translates--

MCKEE
“For the great day of wrath has
come”

Aarondale finishes for him

AARONDALE
“and who can stand”

MCKEE
Revelation 617

HILL
What in tarnation is this place

PATRICK
A gateway to the living world

Patrick goes to Aarondale at the pedestal hands him the key

PATRICK
This is what they are coming for
We are here to defend and fight for
those beyond it Those in the
living world It’s why we’re here
If we don’t everything we once
stood fought and died for will be
gone

McKee makes the sign of the cross
MCKEE
The day of war is at hand and thus
the battle for salvation begins

SMOKE
Bullshit We’re done here

Smoke storms out of the chamber
EXT THE CITADEL - COURTYARD

Donnellan catches up to Smoke as he gathers his gear

SMOKE
(to Donnellan)
Come on We don’t have time for
this Let’s go

DONNELLAN
I’m not going with you

Patrick and the men catch up

PATRICK
You can’t leave

SMOKE
Watch me

PATRICK

You can’t keep running away Smoke

Smoke throws his bag to the ground furious He gets right
up into Patricks face--

SMOKE
I pick what battles I fight Not
you not your father This ain’t
my fight

PATRICK
He was right you are a coward

Smoke PUNCHES Patrick He goes down hard
SMOKE
You don’t know what the fuck you’re
talking about
Patrick gets to his feet doesn’t dust himself off
SMOKE
I’ve heard all this before That
this is the one the one worth
dying for I’11 tell you what
nothing is worth dying for

Smoke turns to Donnellan one last time She says nothing

SMOKE
Your funeral

Smoke picks up his pack and walks out

EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL - LATER

Patrick meets Aarondale along the wall In the distance a
LINE OF FIRE sweeps toward the Citadel filling the horizon

AARONDALE
It won’t be long

Patrick watches Smoke exit and weave his way through the
thousands of soldiers transfixed on the BLAZING SKYLINE

Aarondale calls out to his men

AARONDALE
Batten the gates

The SOLDIERS gathered outside rush to the wall Their panic
is tangible They’ve seen the Fire Army and will do anything
to escape their rampage

AARONDALE
Listen to me You must listen

The crowd refuses to listen their frantic energy escalating

Patrick snatches up an M-60 aims skyward and pulls the
trigger Round after round BOOMS into the air the sustained
volley grabs the attention of the panicked below

Silence falls

PATRICK
Listen up The man has something
to say

Patrick draws the broadsword presents it to Aarondale He
leaves Aarondale on the wall alone a pillar of strength to
inspire the men below as only he can

Aarondale every eye on him takes in the moment then speaks-

AARONDALE
Our true enemy approaches These
walls were built not for our
protection but for those beyond it
Within this Citadel is a gateway to
Earth We have been sent here to
defend it The future of humanity
hinges on what we do here on what
we do now

Aarondale raises his broadsword into the air

Every soldier to a man raises their weapons in response
They unleash a WAR CRY that shakes the ground ROARS into the
heavens

INTEXT THE CITADEL - PREPARATION MONTAGE

Patrick and Hill bury munitions throughout the trenches and
attach them to DETONATION CORD

Donnellan and other SNIPERS settle in at the tower converting
Aarondale’s chambers into a snipers nest laying out STACKS
OF AMMO preparing their lines of fire

Worthington walks the trenches inspecting the TROOPS
Gawonii SHARPENS HIS TOMAHAWKS

Aarondale paces the Citadel wall keeping a watchful eye on
the approaching Fire Army

McKee prays
The Citadel gates are SECURED AND BARRICADED
EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL - NIGHT

Donnellan climbs up the ladder and finds Patrick alone He
stacks sandbags around a 50 caliber position Patrick sees
her but goes right back to stacking

PATRICK
(not looking at her)
So why didn’t you go with him

DONNELLAN
I’ve been asking myself the same
question

Patrick keeps stacking

DONNELLAN
Smoke sees this as another battle
that can’t be won I see this as a
battle that can’t be lost

Patrick is unmoved He picks up the 50 caliber slams it
into its tripod He pulls the bolt back loads it

DONNELLAN
You’re a born leader like your
father He would have been proud

Patrick stops for a second looks at her then slaps the
magazine closed He returns to his sandbagging

Taking the hint Donnellan walks away but not before--

PATRICK
It’s like it was yesterday

Donnellan stops and turns back Patrick continues
sandbagging never pausing for a second

PATRICK
I only had a few years with him and
the further away they got the less
real they felt I would look at
old photos of us and I couldn’t be
sure if what I was remembering was
an actual moment in time or one I
made up in my head

Donnellan takes up a sandbag helps Patrick Still his
focus never wavers from his task

PATRICK
I had to find a way to connect with
him before it was too late That’s
why I enlisted I chose the same
life he did
(beat)
And it got us both killed

Patrick turns and finds Aarondale standing behind him in FULL
BATTLE ARMOR Donnellan places her last sandbag then walks
off leaving them alone

Aarondale looks to the trench system and beyond

AARONDALE
Today I shall lead my men into
battle I do not expect to return
Those who remain will need someone
to lead them

He removes the chamber key from around his neck and hands it
to Patrick

AARONDALE
God speed

Patrick hangs the key around his neck

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM - LATER

The calm before the storm Soldiers pack tightly into the
trenches You could hear a pin drop as they nervously look
to one another

EXT WOODLINE

The ground RUMBLES The Fire Army has arrived The ENTIRE
FOREST goes up in flames The Four Horsemen atop their fiery
steeds silhouetted against the burning timber enter the
field of battle

Countless Fire Soldiers follow flooding the valley They
roll an ENORMOUS BLAZING HOWITZER into position

over the battlefield The soldiers along the wall look to
him He pulls Forte’s PLAYING CARD from his pocket and slips
it into the band of his helmet

PATRICK
For mankind

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM
Volac stands in his stirrups A collective ROAR erupts from
the Fire Army Fiery shells EXPLODE from the HEAVY ARTILLERY

and streak through the air impacting on the Citadel walls

Mastema leads the charge He rears back his steed and drives
toward the trench line thousands of Fire Soldiers in tow

A barrage of MORTARS rocket over the wall arch over the
trench lines and strike the leading edge of the Fire Army

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM
The mortars impact all around Mastema the explosions reeling
his horse Hundreds of Fire Soldiers are laid to waste by

the barrage

Mastema is enraged He leans on the reins the blazing steed
responds charging forward again

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

Shoot and move

The men in the trenches follow him

WORTHINGTON
Keep them coming Keep them
coming

The Fire Army reaches the first line of trenches ENGULFING
THEM IN FLAMES Mastema jumps his steed over the first line
of trenches driving hard racing towards the retreating men

WORTHINGTON
We have to keep pulling back

EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL
Patrick and the soldiers atop the wall OPEN FIRE

PATRICK
Cover the retreat

Patrick calculates as Aarondale and Worthington pull the men
back luring Mastema and the Fire Army closer

Hill unspools the reel of DETONATION CORD Affixing the end
to a detonation plunger--

HILL
Now

PATRICK
Not yet They have to be closer

HILL
Closer

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

Worthington draws the Fire Army closer and closer to the
Citadel walls Nearly every trench has been overrun

They have fallen all the way back to the Citadel walls when
Aarondale calls up to Patrick--

AARONDALE
Do it

EXT THE CITADEL - TOP OF THE WALL
Patrick turns to Hill--

PATRICK
Now

Another ARTILLERY SHELL slams into the Citadel the BLAST
catapulting Hill over the wall He grabs hold of the edge
but the PLUNGER falls to the battlefield below

Patrick sees the plunger and is about to jump for it when--

HILL
No

Numb from the shock Hill looks to his lower body His legs
are missing Hill looks to the plunger below and then back
to Patrick He knows what he has to do

HILL
Protect the chamber

He releases his grip--

EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES

Hill hits the ground hard turns for the plunger-- it’s just
out of reach He valiantly pulls and scratches along the
ground--

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

Mastema is closing He draws his burning sword raising it
into position One trench separates him from Worthington--

Worthington raises his rifle--
EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES

Hill reaches the plunger-- rolls to his back and finds a Fire
Soldier over him bringing his BAYONET down when--

BLAM A single SHOT hits the Fire Soldier its head EXPLODES
into a ball of flame

EXT THE CITADEL - SNIPER TOWER - CONTINUOUS
Donnellan pulls her eye from the scope

With his last ounce of strength Hill squeezes the plunger

KABOOM A TERRIFIC EXPLOSION ripples throughout the trench
lines

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

Mastema receives the brunt of the BLAST the exploding
munitions tearing him and his horse to shreds

The concussion slices through the Fire Soldiers trapped in
the trench lines

EXT THE CITADEL - AT THE GATES

Hill looks over the decimated battlefield a faint smile and
then he’s gone

The first wave of Fire Soldiers have been eliminated The
men on the field CHEER

Worthington’s smile fades as he looks back to the Citadel

WORTHINGTON
Bloody fuckin’ hell

The explosion was so forceful that it blew the GATES down
EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM

Fire Soldiers charge

woodline

EXT THE CITADEL - REINFORCEMENTS

--it’s SMOKE He leads the Mongols into battle Tearing
into the rear of the Fire Army catching them off guard

as the fireball IMPACTS Thick black smoke fills the air

PATRICK
(to McKee)
Get to the chamber
As McKee rushes off Donnellan dives in next to Patrick

They’re coming through

The Fire Soldiers rush through the thick smoke and into the
courtyard An intense GUN BATTLE erupts

INT THE CITADEL - CORRIDOR
McKee waits for Donnellan and Patrick at the barricade
PATRICK
Mack get inside the chamber check

McKee bolts into the corridor Patrick and Donnellan remain
at the entrance just the two of them

Fire Soldiers round the corner-- Patrick and Donnellan drop
to the ground and open up

Amidst the chaos Volac steps through the smoke dragging a
HUMAN SOLDIER by the neck

Patrick STOPS FIRING

DONNELLAN
What are you doing Keep firing

Patrick is transfixed Donnellan sees what he is looking at--

The soldier is COLONEL PATRICK Volac tosses him to the
ground presenting him to Patrick The Colonel dazed
struggles to his feet

Volac snatches up the Colonel crucifying him high above his
head He spreads his TALONS as flames surge from his
fingertips

Volac IMPALES the Colonel with his burning talons

PATRICK
No

Something happens-- Colonel Patrick’s body GLOWS until it
BURSTS into flames Volac turns up the heat then THROWS the
Colonel’s limp body through the air

Just before it hits the ground the Colonel ERUPTS in a blast
of WHITE HOT FLAMES and lands on his feet TRANSFORMED

He’s DOUBLED in size and girth his hulking features GLOWING

plunger but nothing happens

DONNELLAN
Shit

Colonel Patrick smiles He raises his rifle at Donnellan--

She twists it again KABOOM Charges hidden in the corridor

Donnellan drops the plunger and dives inside slamming the
doors shut

INT THE CITADEL - CHAMBER

Donnellan grabs Patrick He’s dazed

DONNELLAN
It’s not him it’s not your father
He’s gone

Patrick doesn’t answer

DONNELLAN
Do you hear me He’s gone There’s
nothing you can do about it You
can’t bring him back now anymore
than you could the first time you
lost him

Patrick looks at her with vacant eyes

DONNELLAN
You can’t change that But you can
make a difference here and now We
have to stop them and I need your
help

BLAM The door is BLOWN off its hinges Fire Soldiers pour
in

Donnellan pulls Patrick as McKee dives for cover

A FIREBALL screams down the corridor and EXPLODES into the
mouth of the chamber wiping out all of the remaining Fire
Soldiers

When the smoke settles Volac enters the chamber with the
Colonel at his side

Donnellan rolls into the open and FIRES hitting the Colonel
and knocking him to the ground

Volac picks up a piece of rubble and throws it at her The
impact sends her sliding across the floor

McKee rushes to her side she’s out cold but alive McKee
sees her rifle picks it up and turns it on Volac His HANDS
tremble as he crosses the chamber

MCKEE
Yea though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death I
will fear no evil

McKee’s hands steady He TIGHTENS his grip on the rifle
MCKEE

Thou preparest a table before me in
the presence of mine enemies

Volac LAUGHS

MCKEE
and I will dwell in the House of
the Lord forever

McKee OPENS FIRE Bullets rip into Volac He ROARS in anger
and lunges at McKee swatting him across the chamber laying
him out

Volac turns and finds Patrick in front of the gateway rifle
in hand

PATRICK
Over my dead body

Colonel Patrick gets to his feet and stands at Volac’s side
He turns to the Colonel and nods launching him across the
chamber at Patrick

The Colonel drives Patrick into the wall The impact brings
rubble raining down Patrick loses his grip on the rifle

The Colonel tears Patrick’s shirt open revealing the KEY
Pulling it free the Colonel tosses it to Volac

Volac catches it

The Colonel then tosses Patrick into the air He SLAMS into
the ceiling and drops straight down onto the pedestal He’s
battered and bleeding

The Colonel crosses to his son intent on finishing him He
takes Patrick by the neck lifts him high squeezes

Patrick grabs the burning forearms of the Colonel gasping
for air--

PATRICK
(breathless)
Wait I
The Colonel is unrelenting-- squeezing-- shaking Patrick
Patrick reaches into his torn shirt pulls out the Colonel’s
dog tags The tags flash in the light The Colonel is drawn
to them--

--the NAME comes into focus “Colonel Nathan Patrick”

With Patrick’s last breath--

PATRICK
I’m your son

The Colonel looks at Patrick He stops the shaking his grip
loosens a moment of recognition when--

--a FIREBALL crashes in blowing the two apart

Volac stands in the center of the chamber blowing away the
fresh smoke wisping from the tips of his talons

Volac crosses to the pedestal inserts the key and turns the
stone

The GIGANTIC DOORS open flooding the room with BLINDING WHITE
LIGHT Volac crosses the chamber and climbs the steps

PATRICK (0S)
Hey I was talking to you

Volac finds Patrick on his feet barely He rockets across
the chamber seizing him driving him back pinning him to
the pedestal

FLAMES erupt from his talons shooting into Patrick’s arms
Patrick SCREAMS Volac begins to TRANSFORM him The flames
lick the sides of Patrick’s face his skin BLISTERING from
the heat

The transformation is nearly complete when--

--Worthington bursts into the chamber TOMMY GUN BLAZING
Bullets rip into Volac forcing him to drop Patrick

Volac reels around unleashes a FIREBALL at Worthington as
Gawonii rolls in the chamber and hurls his TOMAHAWKS--

--striking Volac in the back ROARING in pain he pulls the
tomahawks from his back takes aim of Gawonii when—-

SMOKE (0S)
Patrick

Smoke dashes into the chamber Aarondale’s broadsword in
hand He slides across the floor tosses the blade over
Volac’s head--

Patrick snatches the sword out of the air and SLICES one of
Volac’s ARMS off

Volac HOWLS then turns to Patrick swinging wildly with the
other tomahawk when a SHOT rings out

Volac’s leg is blown off at the knee dropping him to the
floor

Donnellan is on her feet sniper rifle in hand--

DONNELLAN
Gotcha you son-of-a-bitch

The men converge on Volac GUNS BLAZING Volac tries to push
forward on to the gateway More SHOTS knock him back down

Volac claws his way to the base of the stairs his thick
black blood smearing the chamber floor

PATRICK
Cease fire

Patrick is poised on the stairs above Volac looking down on
his defeated enemy He raises the blood soaked broadsword
over his head--

PATRICK
Hooah motherfucker

Patrick swings taking Volac’s HEAD clean off His body
drops to the chamber floor bursts into white hot flames

FIRE lurches out of his neck then draws back into the
corpse

The body IMPLODES a SHOCK WAVE knocks everyone back

EXT THE CITADEL - NIGHT

The shock wave BLASTS out of the Citadel and over the trench
system As it crosses the battlefield it SUCKS THE FLAMES

out of the remaining Fire Soldiers the scorched bodies fall
lifelessly to the ground

INT THE CITADEL - CHAMBER
Volac’s BODY is gone
Patrick rushes to the Colonel who lies motionless Burns

cover his entire body He’s in bad shape Patrick kneels
beside him

his son The Colonel lifts his hand and Patrick takes it

COLONEL PATRICK
Nathan

PATRICK
Yeah It’s me

A smile comes over the Colonel’s face

COLONEL PATRICK
Nathan

PATRICK
We beat ‘em dad

The smile quickly disappears--

COLONEL PATRICK
No This is just the beginning
more will come from across the
Lake the Lake of Fire

The Colonel trails off He’s fading fast

PATRICK
Dad

The Colonel squeezes his son’s hand tighter pulls him close

COLONEL PATRICK
I’ll always be with you Nathan I
always have

The Colonel’s eyes close and his grip goes slack the life
leaves his body Patrick gently lowers his father’s hand

Donnellan stands by the open threshold doors transfixed by
the brilliance of the light on the other side

Patrick climbs the chamber steps and stands next to her

PATRICK
We can’t They’re going to try
again and if they succeed there
won’t be anything worth going back
for We were sent here for a
purpose To defend these gates

Donnellan looks to Patrick then walks over to the pedestal
She turns the stone closing the giant doors

EXT THE CITADEL - TRENCH SYSTEM - NIGHT
Patrick kneels beside a FRESH GRAVE a rifle marks the head-

stone the helmet hanging from it bears the insignia of a
COLONEL

A YOUNG SOLDIER walks up behind him--

YOUNG SOLDIER

PATRICK
Okay Ill be right there

Patrick pulls his father’s DOG TAGS from his shirt looks at
them for a moment then hangs them from the rifle

PATRICK
Let’s go

Pulling back the Citadel trench system has been converted
into a massive CEMETERY Thousands of WEAPONS and HELMETS
are lined up in perfect rows

EXT THE CITADEL - COURTYARD - LATER

Walking into the Citadel Patrick finds the courtyard filled
with the remaining SOLDIERS in formation They’re ready to
move out

Worthington snaps off a SALUTE to Patrick as he passes

PATRICK
None of that Red

McKee walks up brushes off his Bible and carefully places it
into his pack

PATRICK

McKee slams a magazine into a rifle and slings it over his
shoulder

MCKEE
You made a believer out of me

As Patrick passes by Gawonii--

PATRICK
You ready to go

Gawonii stops and in perfect English--

GAWONII
Waiting on you

Patrick stops in his tracks

PATRICK

GAWONITL

Gawonii walks away Patrick continues to the head of the
formation where Smoke and Donnellan wait for him

PATRICK
(to Donnellan)
Are your men ready

Donnellan flips Hill’s Confederate cap onto her head
something to remember the fallen hero by--

DONNELLAN
As ready as they’ll ever be

SMOKE

PATRICK
We take the fight to them

Patrick shoulders his rifle and walks through the gates
DONNELLAN

You heard the man Company move

out
Pulling up and out we see the landscape from above like
never before Moving at a rapid rate we cross the burned
out forest beyond the marsh past the Northern Lines and
over the dark mountain range to reveal--
--A GIGANTIC LAKE OF FIRE
Moored just off shore are hundreds of thousands of WARSHIPS
from every era of maritime conflict A battle ready ARMADA
poised to set sail

Their destination unknown

FADE OUT
