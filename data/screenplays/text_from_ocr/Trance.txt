TRANCE

Screenplay by

7th June 2011
BLACK SCREEN
The voice of a young man

SIMON
(vo)
It used to be once upon a time
anyone could steal a painting And
d’you know what

EXT VARIOUS INT VARIOUS
MONTAGE

- Mash up from classic sixties heist movies (even though they
weren’t art heists) Gambit Thomas Crown It Takes a Thief
Topkapi Perfect Friday Jack of Diamonds etc Martinis
speedboats divine dresses and men in black sweaters hanging
on ropes

SIMON

(vo)
You didn’t need high tensile wires
as thin as a human hair or special
goggles to see the laser beams you
didn’t need a computer expert a
cool guy a girl and a genius you
didn’t need a fast car and you
certainly didn’t need a speedboat
You didn’t need a stopwatch six
sticks of dynamite and a saint’s
day parade Of course you could
use all those things and you’d
probably get what you were after -

INT DR NO’S LAIR
From Dr No

Goya’s Duke of Wellington hangs on a wall

BOND
So that’s where it went

SIMON
(vo)
But if all you really wanted was a
painting -
EXT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

A car pulls up outside a venerable London auction house

THREE BEEFY MEN get out of the car One remains at the wheel
The men have short wooden or metal clubs
SIMON
(vo)

All it took was a bit of muscle and
some nerve

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

Auction in progress Expensive bit of art on a stand at the
front

Corpulent fifty-something auctioneer FRANCIS conducts the
auction

Novice young assistant SIMON stands by his side
SIMON
(vo)

If you had the balls for it all
you had to do was turn up

EXT AUCTION HOUSE DAY
The THREE BEEFY MEN stroll towards the entrance Brisk but
unhurried Above all brazen
INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY
The THREE BEEFY MEN wade in threatening and surprising
SIMON
(vo)

There was no need for a gun not

when a punch in the face works just

as well
One unfit unprotected SECURITY GUARD (looks more like a
janitor) foolish enough to get in the way gets smacked in the

face

One MAN lifts the painting

EXT AUCTION HOUSE DAY
The car pulls away BEEFY MEN plus painting inside
Sirens approach but the horse has bolted

SIMON

(vo)
And that was that
INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

The shocked aftermath

FRANCIS mops his brow SIMON is just staring ahead

the exit - almost smiling impressed

SIMON
(vo)
But not any more Those days are
gone

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

The same place but it’s changed as SIMON describes

SIMON
(vo)
A business can’t function taking

big hits like that So now we have

procedures precautions security

measures Now we have a policy We

have bag searches silent alarms
Magnetic scanners X-rays and

cameras And all that stuff that no

one had before - everyone’s got it

now So we notify the cops about
big ticket sales and - though
don’t tell anyone this - we even
keep half a dozen Ukrainian ex-
naval commandoes in a van outside
In case it all kicks off Or so
they say

We see people filing in through the searches

Lots more SECURITY GUARDS now Kevlar vests
etc

EXT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

A windowless van is parked directly outside

INT VAN DAY

towards

and scanners

helmets

Tasers

Inside the windowless van SIX BIG GUYS - harder looking -
armed with Tasers mace and illicit weapons - knuckle-

dusters coshes Just waiting waiting

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

The hall is empty apart from STAFF all facing FRANCIS
SIMON
(vo)
Also we have drills And the first
thing they tell us is

FRANCIS
Remember - do not be a hero

An obviously mock robbery begins There’s a frame with a
blank canvas to be stolen A couple of SECURITY GUARDS walk
in shouting “this is a robbery”

SIMON
(vo)
Do not be a hero

FRANCIS
No piece of art is worth a human
life

FRANCIS nods to SIMON His cue for a rehearsed action
SIMON takes the framed blank canvas off the stand

SIMON
(vo)
Sound advice that So I try to
remember it See if you can No
piece of art is worth a human life

INT AUCTION HOUSE CORRIDOR DAY

SIMON escorted by TWO GUARDS (not the ones pretending to be
robbers) hurries along a corridor with the dummy painting

His route takes him around corners and up and down short
flights of stars A narrow corridor Regency wall paper
plush carpet dado rail but with modern fittings - air con
vents in the ceiling spot lighting cctv cameras

SIMON
(vo)
But if circumstances allow - if
remember only if - in the event

of an “event” or a “situation” we
are to remove where possible the
most valuable item or items -

As he walks along SIMON slides the dummy painting into a
black padded zip-up bag

SIMON (CONT’D)
(vo)
- and take them to a place of
safety ie the fast-drop slot in
the time delay vault

Around a corner he reaches the black steel door to a vault
with big handle and time delay lock Beside that is a long
thin slot - an elongated letterbox

INT LETTERBOX DAY

It is in through this that SIMON slides the zip-up bag
containing the painting

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

A new day PROSPECTIVE BUYERS are on their way in An
international crowd Picking up catalogues etc

The day’s sale items are on display

There’s a poster “Spanish Art 1750 - 1850” with an image of a
severed head on a plate underneath - a reproduction of the
day’s star attraction

SIMON
(vo)

That’s all you can do really I
mean you have to let people in if
you want them to bid And when the
reserve price for the star of the
show is going to be fifteen million
pounds you definitely want them to
bid

Ahead of these people the auction is already in progress
and SIMON is conducting it

It’s one of the lesser items he is selling The bids are
going up in five thousand

SIMON is slick and confident keeps it moving

SIMON (CONTD)
-one thirty-five one forty
one forty-fiveone fifty one
fifty-five one fifty-five one
fifty-five sold to you sir
one hundred and fifty-five thousand
pounds Ladies and gentlemen there
will now be a short interval When
we reconvene our senior
auctioneer Mr Francis Lemaitre
will conduct the auction of Goya’s
“John the Baptist”

A murmur of anticipation as SIMON steps down
EXT BACK OF AUCTION HOUSE DAY
SIMON is smoking in a small yard outside the back door

FRANCIS appears annoyed

FRANCIS
Are you coming I am about to
start

SIMON

Start what

FRANCIS
The sale The Goya

SIMON
Oh yeah The Goya

FRANCIS
And this is a no-smoking area

SIMON blatantly takes another draw

SIMON
I’m not smoking

FRANCIS won’t rise to this right now They stare at one
another FRANCIS goes back inside

SIMON finishes the cigarette Grinds it out under his foot

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY
FRANCIS delivers his blurb about the Goya

FRANCIS
This painting was originally
presented to us as being the work
of Villamil who was of course a
student of Goya However on closer
inspection we were not convinced
by this We observed the hand of
another rather greater painter at
work and I am glad to say that
this has now been identified and
authenticated as being the creation
of Goya himself

FRANCIS talks on lauding the glories of the painting

SIMON
(vo)
So what happens of course is that
just as we up our game the
villains up theirs That’s life
(MORE )
SIMON (CONTD)

They don’t just turn up on spec any
more We have precautions they
have plans They do a reccy They
do research They find out about
our cameras and our alarms and our
hypothetical Ukrainian Naval
Commandoes But some things don’t
change It still takes muscle and
a bit of nerve

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

A man passes through the security checks Late thirties
Sharp suit This is AIDAN

He collects his keys from a tray that passed through the X-

AIDAN descends the last few steps to the basement

He walks past a line of crates and boxes of varying sizes
until he finds the one he wants

He lifts out his keys The keyring is a small penknife

He slits the cardboard
INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

Under FRANCIS’s guidance the bidding continues escalating
upwards

A medium sized truck pulls up just in front of the space next
to it

A tear gas launcher and gas-mask to DOMINIC

And a shotgun for himself

back of the van in his wing mirror
INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY
The auction reaches its crescendo

When DOMINIC bursts in announcing his presence by firing a
canister

Screams and panic A crush for the door DOMINIC fires
another The room starts to fill with gas

A GUARD bellows into his walkie-talkie

A crackle on the radio The SIX TOUGH GUYS jump up and reach
for the door just as -

EXT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

streaming out of the building

A modern looking passageway perhaps recently constructed

LEWIS marches along it metal bat in hand There’s a door at
the end

LEWIS smashes it open barely breaking stride

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

DOMINIC fires another canister And another The room is
rapidly filling with gas

DOMINIC disappears into a thick cloud of gas
SIMON acts fast Takes the painting from the stand

He gestures to TWO GUARDS who follow him

INT SECURITY CONTROL ROOM DAY

This is the room LEWIS smashed his way in to Multiple
monitors and a big computer

There’s a GUARD lying curled up on the floor smart enough to
stay there

LEWIS is swinging the bat with fury smashing every single
piece of hardware in the room Nothing will be saved

INT CLOUD OF GAS
DOMINIC is in the dense fog No one else visible

He dumps the canister gun pulls off his coat and his gas
mask He is wearing a shirt and tie

He bends down and picks up a hot gas canister still spilling
out its noxious fumes

He takes a deep breath in

SIMON
(vo)
So when it happens as one day it
must it is imperative not to
panic

INT AUCTION HOUSE MODERN CORRIDOR DAY

LEWIS strolls out of the security room tossing the metal bat
away

SIMON
(vo)
- to follow the drill and let the
training kick in

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

The TWO GUARDS try to keep pace with SIMON who strides ahead
of them around the corners

All we can see of him is his back

Catch a glimpse of something shiny falling to the floor
perhaps dropped by SIMON

SIMON
(vo)
If circumstances allow - if
remember only if - in the event

of an “event” or a “situation” we
are to remove where possible the
most valuable item or items and
take them to a place of safety-

CLOSE UP on the object on the floor as the two GUARDS tread
obliviously past it is a razor-blade

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

Intercut AIDAN making his way to the same destination

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

SIMON turns a corner zip-up plastic bag in hand its
contours indicating the framed painting inside

As he turns around he finds that he is facing AIDAN holding
a shot gun

AIDAN
Stop right there

SIMON and the GUARDS freeze

AIDAN (CONTD)
Put it down

SIMON places the bag on the floor

AIDAN (CONTD)
Step back

They do so
SIMON and AIDAN stare at one another
SIMON
(vo)
But remember - don’t be a hero Do
not be a hero No piece of art is
worth a human life
AIDAN stoops slightly to pick it up
SIMON (CONTD)
(vo)
No piece of art is worth a human
life

As AIDAN stands upright again SIMON snatches a Taser from
the belt of one of the GUARDS and zaps AIDAN

AIDAN is sent falling back by the brief high voltage shock
He curses in agony and pulls the twin barbs from his chest

But as SIMON picks up the bag Aidan rears up again and
smacks him on the head hard with the butt of the shot-gun

SIMON crumples to the floor
The TWO GUARDS are terrified

Calmly AIDAN picks up the bag He looks down at SIMON

AIDAN
Idiot

He walks away

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

A few swirls of smoke Deserted now Cops making their way
in

EXT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

Chaos Traffic blocked CIVILIANS collapsed on the pavement
and the road gasping at oxygen from PARAMEDICS COPS
everywhere The COMMANDOES have got out and are getting in
the way

Amongst the crowd LEWIS and DOMINIC like any two other men
caught up in this eyes streaming coughing make their way
out on to the road

DOMINIC accepts some oxygen then moves on

They drift towards a white van and get in

REECE is at the wheel

The van pulls away

plastic builders funnel attached

AIDAN gets in He lets go Whoosh

EXT BACK OF AUCTION HOUSE DAY

AIDAN emerges from a skip He brushes the dust off Tucks the
bag inside his coat Walks away

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

CLOSE UP a weird object swims into focus filling the
screen Grey metal square with parallel gaps and fins

Then revealed it is an air-con vent in the ceiling

The POV is that of SIMON consciousness just returning to his
brain

He lies on his back on the floor gazing up trying to
remember trying to work it out

Noise of sirens and shouting outside

EXT BACK OF AUCTION HOUSE DAY
SIMON emerges Still looks dazed
He walks and stumbles straight out on to the road

A couple of cars swerve to miss him by inches

INT CAR DAY

POV of unseen driver through windscreen

Moving fast along road

SIMON steps out in front - should cross in time but he does
not Instead he stops - right in the middle of the bloody
road

SIMON - standing motionless and expressionless as the brakes
are slammed on and the car screeches to a halt with the front
of the red bonnet only a hairsbreadth away from hitting him
SIMON looks up

A YOUNG WOMAN looks out at him from inside the red car
horrified at the near collision

EXT LONDON DAY

Not far away AIDAN continues his walk away

He climbs into the back of the white van

INT WHITE VAN DAY
The rest of the gang are waiting

AIDAN brings the black bag out from under his coat with a
flourish

And then - stunned silence

The frame is all there is The painting has been cut out

A one bedroom place Top floor Decent view

But not so nice today The apartment has been gutted
Systematically and utterly Every single possible hiding
place for a square of canvas has been exposed and turned out
Floorboards up Furniture ripped open

SIMON is not surprised

He drops his bag and sits on a piece of broken furniture

And then

The door bell buzzes As he knew it would Still he ignores
it

It buzzes once more
Reluctantly he hauls himself up and goes to the entryphone

He picks it up and listens but says nothing

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

ELIZABETH
Now I suppose you’ve spent some
time trying to remember where you
put them

SIMON
Yeah been over it again and again
Just come against a brick wall
every time

ELIZABETH
Of course But the fact is that
sometimes in these situations the
biggest obstacle to remembering is
ourselves So I don’t want you to
do the work today I want you to
think about someone else someone
who could do it for you That
someone else is going to be
hypnotized that someone else is
going to the remembering Let’s
say another man Like you But
not you

SIMON in close up Eyes closed Sweat trickling down his
brow

ELIZABETH
Now I want you to relax Simon I
want you to let your mind drift
let your mind go free let it go
where it wants and now your mind
is starting to think to think
about those keys

SIMON sits in the chair head bowed eyes closed He’s
dripping with sweat Close in towards him

He sits back eyes still closed his damp shirt momentarily
pulled taut across his chest

The black shape of the radio mic is visible
ELIZABETH can see it too She leans forward

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
-About how heavy or light they
are The shape The metal And you
now can feel them in your hand And
you can look at them and you see
the colour

She stands up and approaches for a closer look She runs a
finger carefully along the covered lead to the mic - confirms
for herself that’s what it is

SIMON is becoming tense excited in trance

SIMON
Blue On a blue keyring

ELIZABETH
And your mind starts to think about
the last time you remember them

SIMON
I’m walking They’re in my pocket

ELIZABETH
I want you to feel them in your
pocket Exactly as they were before
you lifted them out and you placed
them somewhere And as you do that
you’re going to tell me whether
it’s day or night

SIMON
Night

INT REAR OF VAN DAY
The gang listen

ELIZABETH

(Os)
And I want you to think about the
keys that night with those keys
safe in your pocket waiting for
you to place them exactly where you
want a safe place a place that
you will always know and never
forget because it is no accident
that you have placed them here
rather it is so that when the time
is right you will be able to reach
for them and they will be there
waiting for you

A pause
ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(Os)
Where did you say they were
SIMON
(Os)
In my wardrobe
ELIZABETH
(Os)
What’s in the wardrobe
A hesitation

AIDAN stiffens A LONG silence

Eventually almost whispering

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
(Os)
What’s in the wardrobe Simon

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

SIMON’s face wide eyed sweat on his brow rigid expression
facing some unseen horror Still not answering the question

His lips form a word - his is about to speak

Suddenly - the ring tone Loud and insistent it jolts him
from trance

INT REAR OF VAN DAY

LEWIS has dialled He cancels the call AIDAN nods in
approval - close thing

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

SIMON looks around Remembers where he is

SIMON
Was I hypnotized

ELIZABETH
No you were just finding your car
keys
EXT HARLEY STREET DAY

SIMON crosses the road towards the white van

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

ELIZABETH watches SIMON get into the white van

INT SIMON’S FLAT DAY

The flat is still a mess from the original search

The wardrobe is emptied again

No sign of the painting

SIMON reaches into a jacket - the one he was wearing on the
day of the robbery (it’s dirty and crumpled) and pulls out a

set of car keys on a blue key-ring

He looks at them in his hand
SIMON
I was trying to think about the
painting but she kept saying car
keys

DOMINIC
Well that’s it then isn’t it
Garbage in garbage out Can’t be
done

AIDAN
Yes it can She can do the
business Let’s stop giving her
garbage Not the whole truth Just
enough to get something back

SIMON
What do I say sorry I lost them
again

AIDAN

No You be honest

SIMON
I get arrested

AIDAN
You say you’re sorry about the
keys It really wasn’t them It’s
something else something you can’t
talk about

SIMON
Christ She’s not stupid

DOMINIC
It’s not beneath you is it this
Youre not expecting to see her
socially

SIMON
If I say too much and you fumble
the speed dial -
AIDAN
It’s going to work It’s going to
be fine We’re with you We’re all
in that room with you Simon

INT ELIZABETH’S APARTMENT NIGHT

ELIZABETH lit by the screen in her apartment which we can
see is modern and desirable

She contemplates what she has read

EXT HARLEY STREET DAY

The white van is parked again

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

SIMON faces ELIZABETH again

SIMON
You must think I’m a complete
nutter

ELIZABETH

I think perhaps you’ve put yourself
under a lot of pressure

INT REAR OF VAN DAY
The gang are listening as before

SIMON
(Os)
But I don’t have to say what it is
That won’t hold you back

ELIZABETH
(Os)
Absolutely not I’m not interested
in content or context
(MORE )

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Youve come with a very specific
goal Hypnosis is the perfect tool
for the job

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

SIMON
I just need to remember where this
thing is that’s all

ELIZABETH
Good

As she steps forward there is an iPod plus speakers on the
desk behind her and she picks up a small pile of white cards

ELIZABETH presses play with the iPod remote SIMON is
surprised as her pre-recorded voice fills the room

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(recorded)
So I’d like you to close your eyes
and imagine you’re in an elevator

INT REAR OF VAN DAY
ELIZABETH’s voice sounds “live” to the gang

ELIZABETH
(Os)
A wide elevator with velvet walls
and thick carpets and as the doors
close your eyelids become
heavier

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

A pause in the recorded voice

ELIZABETH’s looking at him steadily She lifts a white card
Written on it ARE THEY LISTENING

SIMON almost gasps

She maintains her gaze and points at his chest where the mic
must be

SIMON nods

ELIZABETH
(recorded)
and as your eyes become heavier
and the elevator begins to go down
and you realize that this is the
elevator of relaxation

ELIZABETH holds up the next card ARE THEY IN THE VAN

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(recorded)
And now you’re on the third floor
going down and you could get out
but you want to go on deeper
deeper into relaxation

SIMON nods confirming He’s practically hyperventilating

ELIZABETH holds up the next card a post-card sized reprint
of the Goya

SIMON nods again

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
(recorded)
And you feel that perhaps you’1l
never want to get out it’s so safe
here so comfortable so relaxed

ELIZABETH lifts the final card HOW MANY
SIMON hesitates then lifts four fingers

ELIZABETH mouths “well done” and stands up She stops the
iPod

She walks towards SIMON and before he can react she leans
down towards his chest lifts his jumper and takes a hold of
the small microphone pulling it towards herself

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
I don’t want to talk to Simon
anymore I want to talk to the men
who are listening the men in the
van

INT WHITE VAN DAY
DOMINIC jumps up hitting his head on the roof

DOMINIC
Damn

ELIZABETH
(Os)
If there’s five of you attending
this session we need to re-
negotiate my fee From what I
understand there’s more than
enough to go around

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

ELIZABETH hands the mic back to SIMON who stares at her in
awe

INT PUB NIGHT

AIDAN sits in a quiet booth Bottle of wine and two glasses
Opposite him is ELIZABETH

AIDAN is calmly inspecting the contents of a smartphone
Files about clients emails address book images of friends
and relatives flicking fast through them pausing at

something of possible interest then flicking on

ELIZABETH watches him Eventually seen enough he slides it
back across the table to her

He glares at her Eventually he speaks

AIDAN
Do you feel safe
ELIZABETH
Safe Yes
AIDAN

In here right now yeah But I
mean later I mean when you go
home

ELIZABETH thinks it through

ELIZABETH

I don’t think you’1l hurt me
AIDAN

Why not
ELIZABETH

Well - you seem to have got away
with a certain action in the centre
of London

AIDAN nods

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Now you want to find the object
That’s nice and simple Why would
you want to complicate it
AIDAN
Youre right Absolutely It would
be irrational I mean if you’d
already told someone it’d be too
late and if you hadn’t - why
bother Be a stupid thing to do
And yet we’re like that aren’t
we All of us Sometimes Stupid
Irrational It’s fear I think
Fear of the unknown There’s four
of us but we are frightened of
you

ELIZABETH
You don’t need to be

AIDAN
I’m glad to hear that

A beat He pours They drink

AIDAN (CONTD)
Can you get it out of him

ELIZABETH
I stand a better chance if I’m
given all the facts

AIDAN
I thought you didn’t need context

ELIZABETH
Not if someone’s mislaid their car
keys When they’ve been struck on
the head in the middle of an armed
raid it does help to know Were
you the one who clubbed him

AIDAN
We’re over that

ELIZABETH
He hasn’t forgotten He’s
repressing it

AIDAN
So what do you suggest

ELIZABETH
Therapy will work But only if
we’re all in this together

AIDAN
Finder’s fee is ten percent Take
it or leave it

ELIZABETH
You don’t understand It’s not the
money I have to have equal status
in the group otherwise Simon won’t
respect me If you want to
progress Aidan you really do have
to move beyond getting one over on
people

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY

ELIZABETH AIDAN SIMON DOMINIC LEWIS and REECE are
arranged in a circle of chairs in a large bare rehearsal
space Big windows bright sunlight on wooden boards

ELIZABETH
Hypnotherapy is a means of altering
unwanted or dysfunctional behavior
The unwanted behavior in Simon’s
case is forgetting

DOMINIC
You mean he’s doing it
deliberately

ELIZABETH
Of course not We keep secrets from
lots of people but most of all we
keep them from ourselves And we
call that forgetting So Simon is
choosing to forget He knows what
he did between being hit and being
taken to hospital but he is
refusing to allow himself to
remember That is not a permanent
state It is a behavioral choice
Our challenge is to alter that
behavior

She turns her attention to SIMON He nods he’s ready

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Now Simon I’d like you to close
your eyes I’d like you to think
about being at home

INT SIMON’S FLAT DAY

SIMON’s flat like it was before it was trashed Neatly
furnished SIMON is alone sitting Anything we see of the
world beyond (eg through a window or door) is literally
sketched unreal Only in here is real

ELIZABETH

(vo)
Home is a place where you feel
secure in control and so you’re
at home It’s a day like any other
You are feeling refreshed and
positive and when the doorbell
rings you feel a rush of
enthusiasm because you’ve been
expecting a delivery

INT BIG LONDON HOUSE DAY

Under Elizabeth’s vo SIMON descends the stairs opens the
door to a semi-realsketched POSTMAN etc

ELIZABETH

(vo)
You hurry down stairs and you open
the door and there’s the postman
and he has a parcel for you and it
is the parcel you have been
expecting and you sign for the
parcel and you bring it inside

SIMON holds the bulky parcel in his hands Brown paper
string parcel tape He contemplates it as evoked by
Elizabeth’s voice

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(vo)

You are excited but you stay calm
because you know that this is no
ordinary parcel inside this parcel
is the memory the memory that you
have been waiting for and you know
that when you open it up you will
find what you did that day what
you did with the painting It’s in
there Simon the memory is in
there

He looks around
ELIZABETH is now there sitting on the stairs behind him

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
But you’re not going to rush
Because it’s a big step even to
have got this far even to have
signed for the parcel and to be
holding it in your hands

(MORE )

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Even to have got this far is good
to accept that what is inside
belongs to you and can be opened
by you whenever you want that’s
all you need for now the
confidence to come as far as this
So you take the parcel upstairs
with you back up to your
apartment

INT SIMON’S FLAT DAY

The parcel sits on the table SIMON is seated to one side of
it ELIZABETH to the other

ELIZABETH
And now taking your time you open
it Carefully slowly so as not
upset the contents you open the
parcel

She watches He cuts the string He slits the parcel tape He
folds back the thick crisp sheets of brown wrapping paper
Inside more soft white tissue wrapping He pulls out various
layers of this He looks in he’s almost there but he’s
hesitating starting to hyperventilate ELIZABETH can tell

She stands up A hand on his arm

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
And there you leave it and that’s
fine Nothing’s going to happen to
it It’s not going anywhere The
memory will be there waiting
waiting to be fully opened to be
brought out whenever you are ready
but not before

SIMON looks at the almost opened parcel and then beyond it
where his eyes meet ELIZABETH’s

EXT ROOFTOP NIGHT

The rooftop of the rehearsal room building SIMON leans on
the rail drawing on a cigarette

ELIZABETH
How did you meet them

SIMON
Reece sells drugs I used to buy
from him Just a bit of dope now
and again Something more on
special occasions That’s all
This painting came in at work
(MORE)

SIMON (CONTD)
It was attributed to Villamil - a
student of Goya - but it was me
you see I identified it as one of
his as a Goya Put two more zeroes
on the price But no one thanked
me so I thought why not Why
don’t I have some of that I earned
it Well I don’t know any
criminals but I thought Reece
might He introduced me to Aidan

He turns to her

SIMON (CONTD)
What am I going to do

INT ANTE-ROOM NIGHT

A room just off the rehearsal room Armchairs and a coffee
table The GANG are sprawled around it ELIZABETH faces them

ELIZABETH
He’s afraid that once he’s
remembered you’1ll kill him

AIDAN
Ridiculous

ELIZABETH
That’s why he won’t open up His
behavior isn’t dysfunctional it’s
entirely logical It’s
straightforward self-preservation

LEWIS
More likely to kill him if he
doesn’t remember

ELIZABETH
That’s helpful Don’t you get it
don’t you understand Why do you
think he cheated you in the first
place It was because he was
afraid The painting was the only
security he could put against his
own life

AIDAN
Completely uncalled for

ELIZABETH
Was it Have you ever killed
anyone

He just looks at her Won’t even dignify the question

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

Reece

REECE
Me No

ELIZABETH
Dominic

DOMINIC

No Well I mean yeah In Iraq
Loads probably I was in
artillery you see You never know
exactly what it is you’ve you
know hit

ELIZABETH
And Lewis how about you Ever
killed anyone

LEWIS
Define killed

AIDAN
So what do you suggest How do we
make him feel more secure

ELIZABETH
In an ideal world he’d kill you
all

AIDAN

That’d sort it would it

ELIZABETH
Most likely

AIDAN
All right But supposing for the
sake of argument we don’t go for
that Then what

ELIZABETH
Vulnerability A quality that women
live with all the time that most
men experience to greater or lesser
degrees but which is probably
alien to all of you He needs to
see you weak and exposed to
whatever it is you fear the most

DOMINIC
Aidan - I’m not sure about this

ELIZABETH
It will be in confidence Ima
professional I’m not going to put
you on the stage

(MORE )

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
The only people who will know will
be you me and Simon

REECE
Couldn’t you just make something
up when he’s hypnotized

LEWIS
Yeah like I’m afraid of spiders
Just tell him that

ELIZABETH

Are you afraid of spiders
LEWIS

No
ELIZABETH

It’s just that you mentioned them
LEWIS

I’m not afraid of nothing
ELIZABETH

Good Then you won’t be afraid of

this

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY
Just ELIZABETH SIMON and REECE
REECE is in trance SIMON is watching listening

ELIZABETH

Reece I want you to think about
what it is you are most afraid of
and I want you to think of that
becoming real and I want you to
tell us how you feel tell us how
it is when you cannot escape from
that fear and no matter which way
you turn the fear is there

Close in on REECE He’s not having a pleasant experience
REECE
In the ground there’s a hole

in the ground

CUT TO

EXT PIT DAY

REECE is being buried alive He is in a freshly dug pit
several metres deep struggling to get out but the sides are
far too high and the weight of earth being shovelled down is
too much and gradually he is overcome The soil piles up
around his legs his body his flailing arms his face and
finally his mouth

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY

LEWIS in the chair ELIZABETH and SIMON watching LEWIS is
deep in trance eyeballs roving back and forth under the
lids Just muttering to himself Phrases and words barely
heard

LEWIS
No no no stopitstopitstop
it didn’t didn’t didn’t

CUT TO

INT ROOM DAY
An anonymous bedroom

LEWIS is getting dressed He turns reluctant dragged around
by an unwanted compulsion

There’s a GIRL sitting bolt upright on the bed bruised face
dress torn Her skin is ghostly white Her lips are blue
She’s staring at him with clear unblinking eyes

LEWIS cannot hide from her gaze

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY
DOMINIC in the chair Sweating and trembling

DOMINIC
Ill get there in time I’1l get

get them all out Be fine Be all
fine

INT SCHOOLROOM DAY

Joining it at the exact moment of an explosion a roomful of
smoke and flame

As the smoke clears DOMINIC is standing there in the centre
screaming He is unhurt unmarked in military fatigues

Around him is a room full of the bodies of CHILDREN all
killed by the blast Broken desks and the remnants of
paintings on the wall

He screams and screams

INT ANTE-ROOM DAY

REECE LEWIS and DOMINIC traumatized hunched over each
alone with the after-effects of their unpleasant experience

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY
AIDAN in the chair Gulping Hyperventilating

AIDAN
I’m in a plane I can hear what’s
wrong but no one’s listening
no one does anything we’re
falling falling Jesus Christ
no one’s doing anything Why don’t
they do something

SIMON watches him carefully

SIMON
How do you know when someone’s
faking
ELIZABETH
Why do you think he’s faking
SIMON
I’m not saying he is I’m just
asking
ELIZABETH

Well one reason I know he isn’t
faking is because he knows how
important confidence is If he was
faking it would mean he didn’t
trust you

AIDAN doesn’t flinch

SIMON
Apart from that how do you know

ELIZABETH looks to AIDAN Considers

CUT TO

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY

AIDAN standing at one end of the rehearsal room Eyes open
ELIZABETH and the rest at the opposite end A single chair is
situated between them

ELIZABETH
Aidan I want you to know that this
is an empty room No people no
furniture Just you me and four
walls When you’re ready I’d like
you to walk towards me in a
straight line

AIDAN walks towards them He collides with the chair
knocking it over and falling over it quite spectacularly He
wakes up wincing

ELIZABETH looks to SIMON convinced He is

EXT PARK NIGHT
Dark sky Bright moon

ELIZABETH’s walking through the trees in the moonlight
Peaceful At first it seems as though she is just strolling
But where she stops a man is waiting for her

ELIZABETH
Would you like to know what you
should have done

The man leans in to the moonlight He is AIDAN

ELIZABETH walks away until there’s a tree between them and he
can’t see her The geography is the same as in the rehearsal
room except the obstacle instead of a chair is a tree

AIDAN is irritated that he can’t resist

AIDAN
Were on a football pitch Just you
and me Opposite goals Walk
towards me

He watches the tree The night breeze There are no footsteps
as she approaches No traffic

Eventually she appears taking a detour around the tree and
arriving in front of him Nose to nose

AIDAN (CONTD)
I thought I said we’re on a pitch

ELIZABETH
We are

AIDAN
Then why’d you walk around that
tree

ELIZABETH

What tree
AIDAN hesitates Then smiles slowly She smiles with him
ELIZABETH (CONTD)
It’s beautiful isn’t it The logic
of trance No contradictions Like
being in love
AIDAN
Got enough have you To make him
feel secure
ELIZABETH
We may have a problem Simon’s
jealous of you
AIDAN just looks at her Giving nothing away
ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Why do you think he accused you of
faking

AIDAN
What’s he jealous about

ELIZABETH
Simon thinks he’s attracted to me
It’s very common

AIDAN
Is it

AIDAN takes a step closer to her very intimate Like he’s
going to kiss her

He walks away She smiles She likes him

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY

ELIZABETH and SIMON There’s a camera on a tripod with a
cable snaking out and into

INT ANTE-ROOM DAY

The GANG are watching the session on a screen in here

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY

ELIZABETH
Now Simon you are at home It’s
just a normal day like any other

INT SIMON’S FLAT DAY
SIMON is eating his breakfast He glances round -

REECE AIDAN DOMINIC and LEWIS are present all seated on
chairs in a semi-circle all of them in trance repeating the
torment and distress of their personal traumas

ELIZABETH

(vo)
And although the others are with
you you know now that they won’t
hurt you because when you look at
them you can see that they are
just frail human beings like any
others frightened of the dark
like all of us frightened of the
fears that haunt them that never
let them rest

SIMON gets up and walks to the door He takes a jacket from a
hook and pulls it on

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
(vo)

Look at them and you see them as

they are weak and helpless You

know they can never harm you

SIMON looks back once more at the gang He sneers at them

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
(vo)
And then you hear the doorbell

INT BIG LONDON HOUSE DAY
SIMON’s descends the stairs to the main door

ELIZABETH

(vo)
And so you set off with a spring in
your step because today isn’t a
day for sitting around and waiting
for parcels Today is a day for
putting all that behind you for
getting away from it all for going
somewhere pleasant somewhere
peaceful somewhere beautiful

SIMON opens the door Directly ahead semi-sketchedsemi-
real is a YOUNG WOMAN in an open-top sports car She is the
same woman who nearly drove into Simon in a red car when he
emerged from the auction house on the day of the robbery She
looks passably like Elizabeth (same age general physique)
but is definitely not her

She smiles at SIMON

SIMON walks towards the car and vaults confidently into the
passenger seat As he lands in it -

CUT TO

EXT FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE DAY

The picture is all real now A winding minor road through
Provence

ELIZABETH

(vo)
And there you are in the passenger
seat of an open top car driving
through the French countryside with
a beautiful young woman And the
radio plays some forgotten song and
the sun burns the back of your
heads in the warm wind and with
every mile that you travel all
your problems seem so far away and
so long ago

They drive through the lush landscape on a road past fields
of lavender and sunflowers

The drive continues ELIZABETH’s voice starts to overlap with
that of the YOUNG WOMAN

ELIZABETH YOUNG WOMAN
(vo)
And soon a field of sunflowers
gives way to a low building of
glass and tile It’s cool and dark
inside like a church

Magically they are standing outside exactly that building

EXT FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE DAY INT SPECIAL BUILDING DAY

SIMON’s POV follows the WOMAN into the building all as
described

ELIZABETH YOUNG WOMAN
(vo)
The girl’s dress her calves her
sandals lead you through a
corridor to a vast room of
paintings You can hear her her
voice is much closer than she is

The YOUNG WOMAN’s voice is disembodied like a tour guide

YOUNG WOMAN
Caravaggio’s Adoration Vermeer’s
Concert Cezanne Degas Renoir and
here Leonardo Michelangelo and
Rembrandt himself “The Storm on
the Sea of Galilee”

The tour continues past the paintings towards an inner
chamber

ELIZABETH
(vo)
And as you listen to her your own
personal audio-guide she takes
your hand and leads you through the
paintings

YOUNG WOMAN
These are the lost paintings all
the stolen and destroyed but now
together authenticated safe
secure

ELIZABETH

(vo)
into a final room

INT INNER CHAMBER DAY
A circular domed windowless room
YOUNG WOMAN
That has been specially constructed
for our most recent addition
There are no paintings in here Instead on a stone plinth in
the centre is the parcel in exactly the same state of

unwrapping as SIMON left it in the previous session

SIMON stands before the plinth

ELIZABETH
(vo)

And it’s in here in this magical
safe place with all your troubles
so far away and so long ago that
you feel ready and relaxed and
you reach into the parcel and you
lift out your memory

SIMON does just that And from the heart of the parcel
inside the brown paper the tissue and the bubble wrap he
lifts out a tablet computer already switched on

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(vo)
At last you hold it in your hands -
the memory of what happened that
day the memory of what you did

On the tablet screen SIMON sees the image of himself
standing in the inner chamber looking at a tablet screen upon
which is himself in the inner chamber holding a tablet upon
which etc
ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(vo)

- and now safe and relaxed and

free from harm you decide to

watch you decide to remember
SIMON lowers his gaze to the screen

CLOSE IN on the tablet screen as the picture CUTS TO

INT AUCTION HOUSE DAY

Like fast-forwarding - an abbreviated version of the auction
of the Goya and the subsequent robbery as seen at the start

- FRANCIS reprimanding SIMON out in the back yard

- AIDAN LEWIS and DOMINIC getting in tooling up etc

the auction itself

the tear gas attack etc

- SIMON takes the painting from its stand

INT AUCTION HOUSE CORRIDOR DAY
SIMON sets off for the fast-drop vault
As he walks in front of the SECURITY GUARDS we see him slit

the edge of the canvas with a razor blade and remove it
gently stuffing it inside his jacket

He discards the razor blade and we see it fall

INT AUCTION HOUSE CORRIDOR DAY
SIMON arrives with the TWO GUARDS He is talking to himself

SIMON

Don’t be a hero Do not be a hero
No piece of art is worth a human
life Sound advice that So I try
to remember it See if you can No
piece of art is worth a human life
But if circumstances allow - if
remember only if - in the event
of an “event” or a “situation” we
are to remove where possible the
most valuable item or items and
take them to a place of - Aidan

There is AIDAN just as he was that day shotgun raised

AIDAN
Stop right there

SIMON and the GUARDS freeze

AIDAN (CONTD)
Put it down

SIMON places the bag on the floor

AIDAN (CONTD)
Step back

They do so
AIDAN stoops slightly to pick it up
SIMON

No piece of art is worth a human

life
SIMON snatches the Taser and zaps AIDAN
Same effect as the first time
AIDAN grunts in suppressed agony Climbs to his feet
Controlling his anger Pulls out the two barbs Does not
strike SIMON immediately
Instead he addresses the two SECURITY GUARDS

AIDAN
Could you excuse us

He watches as the GUARDS waddle away and exit

AIDAN raises the butt of the gun

AIDAN and SIMON eye to eye for a moment
AIDAN hits SIMON hard

SIMON collapses

AIDAN (CONTD)
Idiot

AIDAN picks up the package and exits
SIMON is alone

SIMON returns to consciousness He sits up Touches his head
Finds the blood

He reaches inside his jacket

He finds the Goya he stares at it bemused surprised
gradually remembering bits and pieces

EXT BACK OF AUCTION HOUSE DAY

SIMON emerges from the back of the auction house Sounds of
sirens and shouting

He has his jacket held tightly closed Hair matted with blood
on one side

He walks out into the road Cars swerve past SIMON Stops
Looks up

The front of a red car screeches to a halt stopping only
centimetres from him

Inside the car is the YOUNG WOMAN She gasps in horror at
having nearly killed someone

She opens the car door and gets out As she does so she
becomes ELIZABETH

ELIZABETH

My God - are you all right
SIMON

Elizabeth
ELIZABETH

I’m not Elizabeth Shall I call for
an ambulance

SIMON
It’s come back to me Everything
ELIZABETH
Look why don’t I take you to
hospital
SIMON looks into the car

SIMON
Sure Thanks

He gets in

INT RED CAR DAY

ELIZABETH
Shall I help you with the seatbelt

She reaches across for it

SIMON
Why did you lie to me
ELIZABETH
What
SIMON

You made me forget

ELIZABETH
OK - maybe I ought to just call for
that ambulance

Maintaining a confident smile she reaches for her phone
one hand and the door handle with the other

SIMON grabs her wrist

SIMON
Elizabeth

ELIZABETH
Will you let me go please

SIMON
I don’t want you to leave

ELIZABETH
I’m sorry whoever this “Elizabeth”
is - she’s not me

with

SIMON suddenly grabs her throat with his other hand slamming

her head back hard against the head rest
He’s going to strangle her

The image recedes fast as we zoom out into -

INT INNER CHAMBER DAY

The screen of the tablet computer and then straight on
through into SIMON’s eye and out into

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY

The GANG are in fast but SIMON already has ELIZABETH flat on
the floor a hand around her throat

SIMON’s face straining as he is held back cursing and
swearing from ELIZABETH whom he is struggling to reach

He’s shouting at her bitch etc
LEWIS and DOMINIC are haul him off and shove him away
AIDAN
It’s all right it’s all right
Simon You are all right

ELIZABETH is terrified but holding it together

Eventually SIMON relaxes looks around in horror to see where
he is and what he has been doing

Released he turns away The others watch as he walks to the
corner of the room slumps down to the floor sobbing

AIDAN sees the fear in ELIZABETH and turns to look at SIMON
puzzled

CUT TO

INT PUB NIGHT

ELIZABETH is there with AIDAN The same table they first sat
at

ELIZABETH
He’s become obsessed with me

AIDAN
Yeah I got that much

ELIZABETH
It’s good We can use that Or at
least I can
AIDAN works it out
AIDAN

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
It’s all right

SIMON

ELIZABETH
To have feelings

SIMON
So what should I do

ELIZABETH
What would you normally do

He won’t reply

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Oh come on Simon I’m over it You
should be too

She makes him face her Smiles at him

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
If in doubt try something
traditional

She cajoles him

though we barely notice it he frowns Walks away

SIMON (CONT’D)
Actually I’ve never been here

ELIZABETH
Simon

She laughs too

He didn’t ask me

AIDAN
D’you think he’s gay

ELIZABETH shakes her head

AIDAN (CONTD)
So what’s he afraid of

ELIZABETH
You lot more than ever

AIDAN
I thought you’d got him over that

ELIZABETH
Being followed every waking moment
by violent thugs does not create a
serene emotional landscape within
which I can work

AIDAN
Shouldn’t have stolen our painting
then should he

ELIZABETH
Every day you make it worse He
phoned me last night - at 3 am -
to tell me he couldn’t sleep Do
you know why he couldn’t sleep
Because you were in his apartment
He could see you there hear you
smell you he could even feel your
fist in his face Of course I
talk him down he becomes rational
and in the cold light of day he can
describe it as simply a nightmare -
but that is what his life has
become

AIDAN
He’1ll get over it

ELIZABETH
I need time to work on him He has
to confront his fears in order to
overcome them Then perhaps he’1l
invite me in

AIDAN sits back decidedly unimpressed

AIDAN
And I thought you did this for a
living

She’s had enough She gets up and walks out

EXT STREET NIGHT
ELIZABETH is walking away from the burger bar

AIDAN catches up with her calls from behind
AIDAN
Is this a real tantrum or just a
come-on

She stops Turns to him

ELIZABETH
I’m beginning to think you don’t
want me to sleep with him

AIDAN is caught off guard She approaches Conciliatory
sexy

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Aidan I’m big enough to admit
there’s sexual tension between us
We’re both generating it It
doesn’t demean either of us but it
is complicating our relationship
So why don’t we just get rid of it

She looks into his eyes

ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
Would you like to take me home and
fuck me

AIDAN’s holding on by his fingernails

AIDAN
I’m not interested

of the drawers by the bedside is a gun She looks at him

ELIZABETH
I must remember never to forget
that you’re a criminal

He smiles closes the drawer and lights a cigarette they
share

As ELIZABETH passes the cigarette he notices the scar on her
right forearm

AIDAN
Where d’you get that

She looks at him deciding whether to confide Eventually

ELIZABETH
I was in a relationship

AIDAN
I see Sorry

ELIZABETH
It’s all right I can talk about
it He stubbed a cigarette out on
my arm

AIDAN
That’s bad

ELIZABETH
Yes He pinned me down Held my
arm Ground the cigarette out Then
he lit another Did it again in
exactly the same place And so on
Twenty cigarettes in a packet

AIDAN
Got his address
ELIZABETH
That’s kind of you but no thanks

AIDAN
Why aren’t you angry

ELIZABETH
To be angry is to be a victim I’ve
moved on That’s the only real
victory you can have

He’s looking at her concerned

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
I’m all right

AIDAN
Are you So why are you doing this
then You’re a professional Got a
career We might get nothing in the
end you know

ELIZABETH
What does it matter

nightmares about being attacked by
them - that that was why -

SIMON
What -

ELIZABETH
I had to tell him something I had
to buy us some more time -

SIMON

He grows determined Takes a fierce grip of her hand

He’s married

ELIZABETH
I know At eighteen Why do you
think he’s always so keen to beat
you up

SIMON
He’s not after me

ELIZABETH
And I suppose your boss wasn’t
after you either I don’t think you
realize how flirtatious you are
with men No wonder you drive them
insane

SIMON
I don’t flirt

stops and he turns to look at the bathroom door The door
knob turns slowly

The door swings back slowly to reveal ELIZABETH naked
shaved nude one hand behind her back

The room seems to distort around her as she advances She
steps up to him and his fingers trail over her body and down
to her smooth lips

And from behind her back she reveals the instruments of his
satisfaction leather bindings for wrists and ankles

Leave her -

Hardly looking round LEWIS launches an arm and - SMACK - he
catches SIMON across the face with a back-hander

He found it the first time The
first time he came to see me
Remember - you thought you’d just
found your car keys But you were
right - it’s in there - in the car

pieces It’s not in there

ELIZABETH
Not like this Please

He aims the gun at her head

SIMON
Do it

She starts hesitant at first but gradually slipping into a
rough approximation of her professional style more tense
than usual but effective enough As SIMON goes into trance
the gun lowers but is still pointing at her She glances at
it appropriately terrified of what SIMON might do at any
time

As the trance begins and continues INTERCUT with - the
journey through London and out to Essex The West End the
City Whitechapel Mile End and the estates beyond
Buildings cars lights people go by in a blur or loom up
close to the oblivious SIMON deep in trance finger on the

distorted and hallucinogenic in appearance while the
memories in Simon’s trance are realistic

you fear that you will lose her It
torments you

The robbery has started Tear gas spreads

SIMON reaches for the painting on the easel

you will die

INT AUCTION HOUSE CORRIDOR DAY

SIMON winds his way along the corridor followed by the
GUARDS

The razor blade is discarded

INT RESTAURANT NIGHT
The cosy trattoria we saw earlier SIMON is shouting abuse at

A real scene DINERS look on shocked

Murder in his

ELIZABETH
(vo)
She is frightened Really
frightened now

Holding her throat SIMON forces ELIZABETH down on to the
floor on her back He straddles her chest pinning her down
with his knees From his jacket he calmly lights a
cigarette He takes a hold of one of her arms

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(vo)
And she knows that if this goes on
there can be only one outcome In
the end she knows you will kill
her

SIMON grinds out the first cigarette on her arm

INT ELIZABETH’S APARTMENT BEDROOM NIGHT

ELIZABETH wraps a bandage around her arm Deep in thought
about what she can do

ELIZABETH

(vo)
The police are not interested
Lawyers advise her to change her
name and leave the country But she
will not do this she will not be a
victim twice over Instead she
will take control And so she
perverts the therapy Never mind
the smoking she tells you -

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY
ELIZABETH sits with SIMON He is deep in trance

ELIZABETH
It’s not cigarettes you want to
forget Simon It is me

She continues speaking under the vo

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

(vo)
She can’t make you forget But she
makes you want to forget And
gradually day by day week by
week you do You call less often
The passions subside You’re late
for therapy and one day you don’t
come at all

INT CONSULTING ROOM DAY

The day he didn’t come The burn on her arm has healed Only
the scar remains

ELIZABETH
(vo)
At last you have suppressed the
memory of me

ELIZABETH sighs with relief It has worked She is free
ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(vo)
But the memory is not destroyed It
is locked in a cage and with
enough force enough violence the
lock can be broken

INT AUCTION HOUSE CORRIDOR DAY

His eyes flicker and open

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

Maybe not completely not entirely

but enough to drive you to make

you feel you have been cheated

enough to make you angry
EXT BACK OF AUCTION HOUSE DAY
SIMON steps out on to the road
The red car screeches to a halt centimetres from him
The car door opens A woman gets out not yet fully seen
SIMON stares at her

ELIZABETH
(vo)
What did she look like
SIMON
(vo)

She looked like you
EXT BACK OF AUCTION HOUSE DAY
We see the woman now as she rushes to SIMON with concern
is the YOUNG WOMAN WITH DARK hair who appeared at moments
SIMON’s jumbled trance memories

INT RED CAR NIGHT

ELIZABETH
Did she Was that it

SIMON answers from his trance
SIMON
Yes She looked like you

you in
INT RED CAR DAY
YOUNG WOMAN

Shall I help you with the seatbelt

She reaches across for it
SIMON
Why did you lie to me
The YOUNG WOMAN is unsettled
YOUNG WOMAN
What

SIMON
You made me forget

YOUNG WOMAN
OK - maybe I ought to just call for
that ambulance
Maintaining a confident smile she reaches for her phone with
one hand and the door handle with the other

SIMON grabs her wrist
SIMON
Elizabeth
YOUNG WOMAN
Will you let me go please

SIMON
I don’t want you to leave

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m sorry whoever this “Elizabeth”
is - she’s not me
ELIZABETH
(vo)
And then
INT RED CAR DAWN
In the present as they drive through the industrial
hinterland alongside the Thames daylight is creeping up on
them now
ELIZABETH
And then you
INT RED CAR DAY (PAST)
SIMON suddenly grabs the YOUNG WOMAN’s throat with his other
hand slamming her head back hard against the head rest
EXT SCRAPYARD DAWN
Finally they arrive as the sun rises
The breakers yard by the Thames estuary
Elizabeth’s car crawls across it dwarfed by the crane and
the stacks of cars Others are parked awaiting stripping or
crushing
INT RED CAR DAWN
ELIZABETH remembering for herself now
ELIZABETH
A few months later you came back

INT HARLEY STREET WAITING ROOM DAY

The scene we only overheard the first time ELIZABETH says
his (false) name just as she sees him

ELIZABETH
Mr Maxwell

SIMON
That’s me

She stands shocked for a beat her mind flicking through the
memories we know now SIMON smiles innocent and friendly

SIMON (CONTD)
Is everything all right

INT RED CAR DAWN
AIDAN stops the car

All three sit in silence SIMON emerges from trance with
sigh

SIMON
It’s in the trunk

ELIZABETH
What is

SIMON
You are

EXT SCRAPYARD DAWN

ELIZABETH gets out of the car

She walks around to the trunk

She pulls at the handle Nothing She pulls harder and the
sticky seal separates The trunk opens The smell knocks her

back

She’s looking at a corpse six months dead Curled up in the
trunk A decayed woman Maggots flies She stifles a scream

SIMON speaks from inside the car

SIMON
Is it there

ELIZABETH looks down at the corpse in the trunk There’s a
rolled up canvas beside it

SIMON (CONTD)
Is it there or not

ELIZABETH pulls out the canvas and slams the boot shut
Shaking
INT RED CAR DAWN

SIMON leans forward He smacks AIDAN hard with the gun on the
back of his head

AIDAN slumps woozy and confused

SIMON gets out

EXT SCRAPYARD DAWN

SIMON takes the roll from her unravels the canvas and looks
at John the Baptist Then hands it back to her as though it
is of no interest

SIMON
Thank Christ it’s over

SIMON goes to the trunk and opens it ELIZABETH can’t avoid
putting her hand to her mouth against the smell SIMON
doesn’t seem to smell anything He doesn’t react to the body
at all as if it’s invisible
He lifts out a can of petrol
SIMON (CONTD)
The good news is I think this time
I really am over you

Then he begins to douse the car with petrol Slops a good
load in trunk A bit over the roof A load in the front seat

INT RED CAR DAWN
AIDAN’s eyes are open but his brain is not functioning He
slowly realizes what is happening Too slowly

EXT SCRAPYARD DAWN

SIMON pours the last of the petrol over the tyres and side of
the car

ELIZABETH tries to pull the can from SIMON He pushes her
away Tosses the can away It’s empty anyway

He pulls out a packet of cigarettes

ELIZABETH
No - no please don’t

SIMON
Just one more I promise Then I am
definitely going to stop

SIMON finds his matches
ELIZABETH
You can’t do this Please - let him

out

SIMON lights his cigarette Blows out the match Take a draw
Exhales

Inside the car the petrol-soaked AIDAN comes to as SIMON
takes the glowing cigarette from his mouth

ELIZABETH tackles SIMON He’s far too strong for her but she
only needs to hold him back for a few seconds to give AIDAN
time to escape She struggles valiantly to get the cigarette
but he forces her hand down to the petrol trail and it
ignites The flames race towards the car AIDAN starts to
open the door just as the flames arrive and engulf the
outside of the car He slams the door shut The car’s in the
centre of a burning lake The inside starts to fill with
smoke

SIMON straddles ELIZABETH takes out his gun Pushes it
against her

SIMON
I’m going to try and forget you did
that

AIDAN turns the key in the ignition The engine kicks into
life

SIMON hears the engine and turns back to the inferno AIDAN
struggles to find the gear stick in the smoke Then the
windscreen shatters SIMON’s shooting at him

ELIZABETH scrambles free She has an idea She runs to one of
the scrapyard cars and gets in

INT SCRAPYARD CAR DAWN

ELIZABETH’s luck is in The keys are there She starts the
car

INT RED CAR DAWN

AIDAN has SIMON in his sights now and revs the engine grimly
ready to knock him down He puts the car into gear The car

doesn’t move The tyres are melted

He’s well and truly stuck He sees ELIZABETH reverse in the
scrapyard car escaping Flames start to enter the car

Steering wheel on fire Clutch pedal His feet The driver’s
window shatters

EXT SCRAPYARD DAWN

SIMON advances towards the burning wreck laughing firing
A click The gun is empty He tosses it away

He turns and sees ELIZABETH ready to drive towards him It’s
obvious what she intends

He stands calm and still for a moment He looks at her Their
eyes meet for the last time just like they did once for the
first time SIMON mutters to himself

SIMON
Hurt me Please

ELIZABETH slams her foot to the floor

ELIZABETH’s car hits SIMON square on and crushes him between
cars as she drives on to ram the burning car driving it and
SIMON across the bank over the edge of the river wall

Burning in the air the car finally plunges hissing into the
water The car sinks ELIZABETH gets out and runs to the
edge

AIDAN smashes upside down as the car hits the water Water
rushes in through the windows SIMON has shot out As the
waterfall gushes into the car it sucks SIMON’s body inside
the car AIDAN panics not knowing if he’s alive or not - or
even if he’s alive or not He grapples with the corpse in
what seems like a washing machine of turbulence Goya-esque

Eventually he gets out and to the surface spluttering hyper-
ventilating

As he surfaces he sees ELIZABETH looking down at him

A small wave briefly covers him again and when AIDAN comes
up this time ELIZABETH is gone

AIDAN swims to some steps and climbs wearily out Trudges up
the stone staircase

The wasteland is empty No sign of ELIZABETH or her car
Silence

He sits on the edge looking out over the murky Thames

ELIZABETH
(vo)
Dear Aidan

INT AIDAN’S HOUSE BEDROOM DAY

AIDAN lies on his bed drink in hand gazing ahead The
letter lies on the bed

ELIZABETH

Why you might ask Why did I not
just turn him away that day he came
back

would tell me But I don’t believe
in that

INT NEW YORK CONSULTING ROOM DAY

The opposite of Harley St Minimalist and modern A view on
to the park below

ELIZABETH sits cool as ever in her new office speaking
words unheard to some unseen client

ELIZABETH
(vo)
I think that life is messy and
incomplete around the edges
because that’s how it’s supposed to
be So it wasn’t for revenge -

INT AIDAN’S HOUSE BEDROOM DAY
AIDAN still gazes ahead

ELIZABETH
(vo)
- and it wasn’t to get rich and
as you can see I never really
cared about the painting

Utterly out of place Goya’s John the Baptist is pinned to
the wall of Aidan’s bedroom with thumb tacks

INT NEW YORK CONSULTING ROOM DAY

The CLIENT is gesticulating making some point ELIZABETH’s
mind wanders elsewhere She swivels away gazing out of the
window

ELIZABETH
(vo)

I think perhaps it was love All
over again Isn’t that why people
do the stupid things they do A
kind of love that hurts I can’t
explain and if I could it wouldn’t
be true But there it is

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
