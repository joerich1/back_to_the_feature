COLONELHANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE

your home and we may have a discussion

INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY

The door to the farm house swings open andtheaFarmer
gesturestfor

the SS COL to enter Removing his grey SS cap
inside the Frenchmans home
Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the

Farmers wife

smiling

and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen

in his direction
The Farmer enters behind him closing the door
VA

PERRIER

He kisses her hand then continues without letting go of his
hostess

hand

COL LANDA

routine

FARMERS WIFE

Dont be ridiculous heer Col

While still holding the French Womans hand and looking
into her

eyes The SS Colonel says

COL LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite the rumors I have

heard in the village about your family

are all true Your wife is a beautiful

woman

His eyes leave the mother and move to the three daughters

COLLANDA

(CON T )

And each of your daughters is more lovely

then the last

PERRIER

Merci Please have a seat

The Farmer offers The SS Colonel a seat at the families
wooden

dinner table The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers
offer

and lowers himself into the chair Placing his grey SS cap
on
the table and keeping his black attache case on the floor

by his

feet

The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says

PERRIER

Charlotte would you be so good as to get

The Colonel some wine

COL LANDA

Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite but no

wine This being a dairy farm one would

be safe in assuming you have milk

CHARLOTTE

Oui

COL LANDA

Then milk is what I prefer

CHARLOTTE

Very Well

The mother of three takes a craft of milk out of the ice
box

and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The
Colonel

The SS Colonel takes a long drink from the glass then
puts it down

LOUDLY on the wooden table

COL LANDA
Monsieur to both your family and your
cows I say Bravo

PERRIER
Merci

COL LANDA
Please join me at your
table

PERRIER
Very well

Farmers

The French Farmer sits at his wooden dinner table across

The Nazi
The Women remain standing
Col Landa leans forward and says to the Farmer in a low

CONFIDENTIALLY

COL LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite what we have to
discuss would be better discussed in
private Youll notice I left my men
outdoors- if it wouldnt offend them
could you ask your lovely ladies to step
outside

PERRIER
You are right

G

PERRIER

(to his women)

Charlotte would you take the girls

outside The Colonel and I need to have

a few words

The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders and gathers

daughters taking them outside closing the door behind
The Two Men are alone at the farmers dinner table in the
humble home

COL LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite I regret to inform
you Ive exhausted the extent of my
French To continue to speak it so
inadequately would only serve to
embarrass me However Ive been lead

to believe you speak English quite well

PERRIER
Oui

COL LANDA

Well it just so happens I do as well
This being your house I ask your
permission to switch to English for the
remainder of the conversation

PERRIER
By all means
They now speak ENGLISH

COL LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite while Im very
familiar with you and your family

I have no way of knowing if you are
familiar with who I am Are you aware
of my existence

The Farmer answers

PERRIER
Yes

COL LANDA
This is good Are you aware of the job
Ive been ordered to carry out in France

I

PERRIER
Yes
The Colonel drinks more milk

COL LANDA
Please tell me what youve heard

PERRIER

ve heard the fuhrer has put you in
charge of rounding up the Jews left in
France who are ether hiding or passing
for Gentile

The SSColonel smiles

COL LANDA
table
black

folder

he

The Fuhrer couldnt of said it better
himself

PERRIER

But the meaning of your visit pleasant
though it is is mysterious to me

The Germans looked through my house nine
months ago for hiding Jews and found
nothing

COL LANDA

Im aware of that I read the report on
this area But like any enterprise

when under new management theres

always a slight duplication of efforts
Most of it being a complete waste of time
but needs to be done nevertheless

I just have A few questions Monsieur
LaPadite if you can assist me with
answers my department can close the

file on your family

Taking his black leather attache case and placing

takes out a folder from inside He also extracts a

it on the

expensive

fountain pen from his uniform front pocket Opening the
and

referring to it

COL LANDA

Now before the occupation there were
four Jewish families in this area all
dairy farmers like yourself

The Loveitts The Doleracs The Rollins
and The Dreyfuss is that correct

PERRIER

To my knowledge those were the Jewish
families among the dairy farmers

- Heer Colonel would it disturb you if
I smoked my pipe

Looking up from his papers
the

all the

Nazi

a match

Ss

Ss

COL LANDA
Please Monsieur LaPadite it is your
house make yourself comfortable

The Farmer gets up from the table goes to his shelf over

fireplace and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains

fixins to his pipe He sits back down at the table with his

guest

As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco

to it and begins slowly puffing making it red hot
Colonel

studies the papers in front of him

COL LANDA
Now according to these papers all
he Jewish families in this area have

omewhere in the last year it would appear
hey have vanished

hich leads me to the conclusion that
heyve ether made good their escape

r someone is very successfully hiding

FARMER)
What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
Monsieur LaPadite

PERRIER
Only rumors -

COL LANDA

- I love rumors Facts can be so
misleading where rumors true or false
are often reveling So Monsieur LaPadite
what rumors have you heard regarding

The Dreyfusis

The Farmerlooks at Landa

een accounted for - except The Dreyfusis

the

sets
I

COL LANDA

Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite I want

to hear what the rumors are not who told
them to you

The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe

PERRIER

Again this is just a rumor - but we
heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
into Spain

COL LANDA
So the rumors youve heard have been of
escape

PERRIER
Yes

COL LANDA

Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis

friendly

As the Farmer answers this question the CAMERA LOWERS
behind his

chair to the floor past the floor to a small area
underneath the

floorboards revealing

FIVE HUMAN BEINGS

lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards These
human

beings are The DREYFUSIS who have lived lying down
underneath the

dairy farmers house for the past year But one couldnt call
what The

Dreyfusis have done for the last year living This family
has done the

only thing they could hidden from a occupying army that
wishes to

exterminate them

PERRIER

We were families in the same community

in the same bussiness I wouldnt say

we were friends but members of the same

community we had common interest

The SS Colonel takes in this answer seems to except it
then moves

to the next question
COL LANDA

Having never met the Dreyfusis would
you confirm for me the exact members of
the household and their names

PERRIER

There were five of them

The father Jacob wife Miram

her brother Bob

COL LANDA
- How old is Bob

PERRIER
Thirty - thirty one

COL LANDA
Continue

PERRIER
And the children Amos and Shoshanna

COL LANDA
Ages of the children

PERRIER

Amos - six - I believe And Shosanna
was fifteen or sixteen Im not really
sure

CUT TO

UXT - DAIRY FARM - DAY

The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry
off the

clothes line

They cant hear anything going on inside

e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters

SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER
COL LANDA
Well I guess that should do it
Be begins gathering up his papers and putting them back

into his

ttache case

the Farmer cool as a cucumber puffs on his pipe

COL LANDA

However before I go could I have another

glass of your delicious milk

it

PERRIER

But of course

Farmer stands up goes over to the ice box and takes out
the

aft of milk As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonels
glass

German Officer talks

COL LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite are you aware of the
nickname the people of France have given
me

PERRIER
I have no interest in such things

COL LANDA
But you are aware of what they call me

PERRIER
Im aware

COL LANDA
What are you aware of

PERRIER
That they call you The Jew Hunter

COL LANDA

Precisely Now I understand your
trepidation in repeating it

Before he was assassinated Heydrich
apparently hated the moniker the good

people of Prague bestowed on him

Actually why he would hate the name

The Hangman is baffling to me

It would appear he did everything in

his power to earn it But I on the

other hand love my unofficial title

precisely because Ive earned it

As The Jew Hunter enjoys his fresh milk he continues to
theorize

with the french farmer

COL LANDA

The feature that makes me such a effective
hunter of the Jews is as opposed to most
German soldiers I can think like a jew
where they can only think like a German

or more precisely a German soldier

Now if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast it
would be the cunning and predatory instinct
of a hawk

COL LANDA

(CONT)

Negros - gorillas - brain - lips -
smell - physical strength - penis size
But if one were to determine what attributes
the jews share with a beast it would be
that of the rat

Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing
Where our conclusions differ is I dont
consider the comparison a insult
Consider for a moment the world a rat
lives in Its a hostile world indeed
If a rat were to scamper through your
front door right now would you greet it
with hostility

PERRIER
I suppose I would
COL LANDA

Has a rat ever done anything to you to
create this animosity you feel toward
them

PERRIER
Rats spread disease they bite people -

COL LANDA

- Unless some fool is stupid enough to
try and handle a live one rats dont
make it a practise of biting human beings
Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague
but that was some time ago In all your
born days has a rat ever caused you to
be sick a day in your life I purpose to
you any disease a rat could spread

a squirrel could equally carry

Yet I assume you dont share the same
animosity with squirrels that you do with
rats do you

PERRIER
No

COL LANDA

Yet they are both rodents are they
not And except for the fact that one
has a big bushy tail while the other
has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin
they even rather look alike dont they

136

PERRIER
It is a interesting thought
beer Colonel

COL LANDA

However interesting as the thought may
be it makes not one bit of difference

to how you feel If a rat were to scamper
through your door this very minute
would you offer it a saucer of your
delicious milk

PERRIER
Probably not

COL LANDA

I didnt think so You dont like them
You dont really know why you dont like
them All you know is you find them
repulsive

(lets the

METAPHOR

sink in)

What a tremendously hostile world a rat
must endure Yet not only does he
survive he thrives And the reason for
this is because our little foe has a
instinct for survival and presavation
second to none And that Monsieur is
what a jew shares with a rat
Consequently a German soldier conducts
a search of a house suspected of hiding
jews Where does the hawk look He looks
in the barn he looks in the attic

he looks in the cellar - he looks
everywhere he would hide But there are
many places it would never occur to a
hawk to hide However the reason the
Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria
and placed me in French cow country today
is because it does occur to me Because
Im aware what tremendous feats human
beings are capable of once they abandon
dignity

(Changing tone)

May I smoke my pipe as well

Th e Farmers cool facade is little by little eroding

PERRIER
Please Cononel make yourself at home

fixings

The Jew Hunter removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco

The pipe strangely enough is a Calabash made from a S

shaped goard

kith a yellow skin made famous by Sherlock Holmes
A the Nazi Colonel busies himself with his smoking life
ontinues to hold court at the Frenchmans table

COL LANDA

The other mistake the German soldier
make is their severe handling of the
citizens who give shelter and aid to

the Jews These citizens are not enemies
of the state They are simply confused
people trying to make some sense out of
the madness war creates

These citizens do not need punishing
They simply need to be reminded of their
duty in war time

Lets use you as a example Monsieur
LaPadite In this war you have found
yourself in the middle of a conflict
that has nothing to do with yourself
your lovely ladies or your cows - yet
here you are

So Monsieur LaPadite let me purpose

a question In this time of war what is
your number one duty Is it to fight the
Germans in the name of France to your
last breath Or is it to harass the
occupying army to the best of your
ability Or is it to protect the poor
unfortunate victims of warfare who can
not protect themselfs

Or is your number one duty in this time
of bloodshed to protect those very
beautiful women who constitute your
family

The Colonel lets the last statement stand

COL LANDA

That was a question Monsieur LaPadite

In this time of war What do you consider
your number one duty

PERRIER
To protect my family

COL LANDA

Now my job dictates that I must have
my men enter your home and conduct a
thorough search before I can officially

he
cross your families name off my list

COL LANDA

(CONT)

And if there are any irregularities to be
found rest assured they will be

That is unless you have something to tell
me that will make the conducting of a
search unnecessary

(PAUSE)

I might add also that any information

that makes the preforming of My duty

easier will not be met with punishment

Actually quite the contrary it will be

met with reward

And that reward will be your family

will cease to be harassed in anyway

by the German military during the rest

of our occupation of your country

The Farmer pipe in mouth stares across the table at his
German

opponent

COL LANDA
You are sheltering enemies of the state
are you not

PERRIER
Yes

COL LANDA
Your sheltering them underneath your
floorboards arent you

PERRIER
Yes

COL LANDA

Point out to me the areas where their

hiding

The Farmer points out the areas on the floor with the
Dreyfusis are
underneath

COL LANDA

Since I havent heard any disturbance
I assume that while their listening
they dont speak english

PERRIER
Yes

COL LANDA

Im going to switch back to french now
and I want you to follow my masquerade
- is that clear

PERRIER
Yes
Colonel Landa stands up from the table and switching to

COL LANDA

Monsieur LaPadite I thank you for milk

and your hospitably I do believe our

business here is done

The Nazi Officer opens the front door and silently motions

son to approach the house

COL LANDA

Mademoiselle LaPadite I thank you for

your time we shant be bothering your

family any longer

Yet the LaPadite women watch the Nazi soldiers machine guns

approach the house
The Soldiers enter the doorway Col Landa silently points

out area of

the floor the Jews are hiding under

COL LANDA
So Monsieur and Madame LaPadite
I bid you adieu

The little farm house is filled with SMOKE DUST SPLINTERS

Herman I sense a question on your lips
Out with it
DRIVER
Why did yoy allow a enemy of the state
to escape

COL LANDA
Oh I dont think the state is in too
much danger do you

DRIVER
I suppose not

COL LANDA

Im glad you see it my way Besides

not putting a bullet in the back of a
fifteen year old girl and allowing

her to escape our not nessessarlly

the same thing Shes a young girl no food
no shelter no shoes whos just witnessed
the massacre of her entire family

She may not survive the night And after
word spreads about what happened today
its highly unlikely she will find any
willing farmers to extend her aid

If I had to guess her fate d say shell
probably be turned in by some neighbour
Or shell be spotted by some German
soldier Or well find her body in the
woods dead from starvation or exposure
Or perhaps-shell survive She will

elude capture She will escape to America
She will move to New York city

Where she will be elected President of
the United States

PVT BUTZ (VO)

The Basterds took their lives their

hair their valuables their identity

and finally their dignity in death

True that The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet
does rob the tableaux of a certain dignity that is normally
felt in battlefield shots

BACK TO HITLER

BACK TO THE BASTERDS
Aldo screams to The Basterd whos guarding the two German
prisoners

LT ALDO
Hey Hirschberg send that kraut
sarge over

BASTERD PFC HIRSCHBERG
KICKS SgtRachtman in the back

Zw
PFC HIRSCHBERG

You Go

SgtRachtman is a little slow to respond So Hirschberg

grabs him by the hair YANKS him to his feet and KICKS

in the ass sending him on his way

Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle Indian style with
Aldo in the middle

As SgtRachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds

A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not PvtButz) speaks ove
the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH

NARRATOR (VO)

SgtWerner Rachtman has seen many
interrogations since Germany decided
it should rule Europe But this is

the first time hes ever been on the
wrong end of the exchange

Its always been his belief only a
weakling in mind body and spirt
complies with the enemy under threat
of consequence

As Werner watched men cry like women
pleadingly offer their knowledge in
exchange for their worthless lives

he made a vow to himself

If his role is to die in this conflict
When they put him under the earth his
dignity would be buried with him

For in the other world the gods only
respect the ones they test first

Well Sgt this is your test

And the gods are watching

The captured German Sgt enters the circle of Basterds
stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant
salutes his captor

SGT RACHTMAN

(ENGLISH)
SgtWerner Rachtman
Aldo returns the salute looking up at him

LT ALDO

Stiglitz Heard of em

The two German Sgts look at each other

SGT RACHTMAN

Everybody in the German armys heard

of Hugo Stiglitz

The Basterds laugh a couple pat Hugo on the back
The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK

NARRATOR (VO)

The reason for Hugo Stiglitzs

celebrity among German soldiers

is simple

WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper)

NARRATOR (VO)

As a German enlisted man he killed
thirteen Gestapo officers mostly
Majors
WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS

Zc

NARRATOR (VO)

Instead of putting him up against a

wall the High Command decided to

send him back to Berlin to be made

a example of

Hugo in chains being put in a lone troop truck part of a
prison convoy enroute to Berlin

NARRATOR (VO)
Needless to say once The Basterds
heard about him he never got there

EXT- FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

lights up a cigarette and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face

MADAME MIMIEUX

if I ever see you light up a cigarette
in my cinema again Ill turn you into
the Nazis do you understand
Shosanna is shocked by this statement

SHOSANNA
Oui Madame

MADAME MIMIEUX

And for bringing a open flame in my
cinema you deserve far worse then

a Nazi jewish boxcar With your thick
head what do you think the highest
priority of a cinema manager is
Keeping this fucking place from burning
down to the ground thats what

In my collection I have over 350
35mm nitrate film prints which are
not only immensely flammable but
highly unstable And should they

catch fire they burn three times
faster then paper If that happens
-POOFall gone cinema no more
every body burned alive If I ever

see you with a open flame in my cinema
again I wont turn you into the Nazis
Ill kill you myself And the fucking
Germans will give me a curfew pass

Do you understand me

SHOSANNA

MADAME MIMIEUX
Do you believe me

SHOSANNA

MADAME MIMIEUX
You damn well better

BACK TO ROOF
Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke
Marcel comes onto the roof

MARCEL

cigarette without hearing Madames

book The Saint in New York by Leslie Charteris drinking
wine When the young German Private from the other day
FREDRICK ZOLLER walks in He gets a beer then notices the
French girl sitting in the back He smiles and heads over
to her Oh no not this guy again she thinks

SHOSANNA

FREDRICK

SHOSANNA

a French girlfriend I suggest you try

Vichy

Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over obviously
very impressed with Fredrick They make a fuss over him in
UNSUBTITLED GERMAN which nether Shosanna or the non German
speaking members of the movies audience can understand
He signs autographs for them shakes their hands and they
go on their way

Shosannas eyes narrow

SHOSANNA

SHOSANNA

We run a family operated cinema in Munich
Seeing you run around your cinema

reminds me of them Especially my sister
Helga She raised me when our father
wasnt up to the job I admire her very
much Youd like her she doesnt wear a
German uniform

SHOSANNA
You were raised by Helga

FREDRICK
All my sisters Im the baby but Helga
was the bossiest
SHOSANNA
And your mother and father

FREDRICK

My mother died And my father was a
loser My fathers moto If at first
you dont succeed quit The day he
left good riddance My sisters are

all I need Its why I like your cinema
It makes me feel both closer to them
and a little homesick at the same time

SHOSANNA
is your cinema still operatiing

FREDRICR
Oui

SHOSANNA
Whats it called

5

FREDRICK
The Kino Haus

SHOSANNA
How has it done durring the war

FREDRICK
Actually in Germany cinema
attendance is up

SHOSANNA
No doubt you dont have to operate
under a curfew

FREDRICK
How often do you fill your house

SHOSANNA
(Pfuit) not since before the war
FREDRICK
So if you had one big engagement that
would help you out

SHOSANNA

Of course but thats not likely to

happen

TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
the table They ask for Fredricks autograph he signs it for
them One of the French Girls says in FRENCH how exciting
it is to meet a real live German war hero Shosanna hears
it They leave So thats it she thinks

SHOSANNA
So your a war hero Why didnt you tell me

FREDRICK
Everybody knows that I liked you didnt

SHOSANNA
What did you do
He takes a sip of beer

FREDRICK
Ive shot the most enemy soldiers
in world war twoso far

You bet your sweet ass that got her attention

SHOSANNA
Wow

FREDRICK

I was alone in a bell tower ina
walled off city in Russia It was
myself and a thousand rounds of ammo
in a birds nest against three
hundred Soviet soldiers

SHOSANNA
Whats a birds nest

FREDRICK
A birds nest is what a sniper would call
a bell tower Its a high structure
offering a three hundred and sixty degree
view Very advantageous for marksmen

SHOSANNA
How many Russians did you kill

FREDRICK
Sixty-eight

(BEAT)

The first day A hundred and fifty the
second day Thirty-two the third day
On the forth day they exited the city
Naturally my war story received alot of
attention in Germany thats why they
all recognize me They call me the
German SgtYork

SHOSANNA
Maybe theyll make a film about
your exploits

FREDRICK

Well thats just what Joseph Goebbels
thought So he did Its called Nations
Pride and guess what they wanted me to
play myself so I did They have posters
for it in kiosks all over Paris Thats
another reason for all the attention

SHOSANNA
Nations Pride is about you Nations
Pride is starring you

FREDRICK
I know comical huh

SHOSANNA

Not so comical So what are you doing
in Paris enjoying a rest

stretch

side

her

back

FREDRICK

Hardly Ive been doing publicity
having my picture taken with different
German luminaries visiting troops
that sort of thing Goebbels wants the
film to premier in Paris so Ive been
helping them in the planning

Joseph is very keen on this film

Hes telling anybody who will listen
when Nations Pride is released
Ill be the German Van Johnson
Shosanna wasnt falling for the young German by any

However his exploits as well as his charming manner cant
help but impress But his referring to Goebbels as Joseph
like their friends is all she needed to get on the right

of things This young man is trouble with a capital T and
she needs to stay far fucking away from him
She abruptly rises and says

SHOSANNA

Well good luck with your premier

Private I hope all goes well for

Joseph and yourself Au revoir

And with that she disappears Leaving the perplexed private
alone

EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY

German

GESTAPO MAJOR

The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair for the young lady to
sit

down Shosanna takes the hot seat Seated to her right is
Private Zoller To her left are the two curly pampered
poodles Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
from a small craft on the table
MAJOR HELLSTROM
Try the wine mademoiselle its quite good
Goebbels looks across the table at her

GOEBBELS

well I must say youve made quite a

impression on our boy

Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna

GOEBBELS

I must say fraulein I should be rather
annoyed with you

Francesca interprets

GOEBBELS

I arrive in France and I wish to have
lunch with my star

Francesca interprets

GOEBBELS

Little do I know Bes become
the toast of paris and now he
must find time for me
Francesca interprets

c9 Aca nA¢

GOEBBELS

People wait in line hours days
to see me For the Fuhrer and
Private Zoller I wait

Francesca interprets

GOEBBELS

So finally Im granted a audience
with the young Private and he spends
the entire lunch speaking of you

and your cinema

Francesca interprets

GOEBBELS

So Fraulein Mimieux lets get down
to business

Private Zoller interrupts -
FREDRICK
- Heer Goebbels I havent informed
her yet

GOEBBELS

Unless the girls a simpleton Im
sure shes figured it out by now
after all she does operate a cinema
Francesca tell her

Francesca tells Shosanna in French

FRANCESCA

What theyre trying to tell you
Emmanuelle is Private Zoller has
spent the last hour at lunch

trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
to abandon previous plans for Private
Zollers film premier and change the
venue to your cinema

Zoller reacts

FRANCESCA

(FRENCH
to Zoller)
What

FREDRICK
I wanted to inform her

FRANCESCA

Shit I apologize Private of
course you did

GOEBBELS
(GERMAN

to Francesca)

Whats the issue

FRANCESCA
The Private wanted to inform the
mademoiselle himself

GOEBBELS

Nonsense Until I ask a few
questions he has nothing to inform
Let the record state I have not
agreed to a venue change

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Duly noted
Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna

GOEBBELS
You have opera boxes

SHOSANNA
GOEBBELS
SHOSANNA

GOEBBELS
More would be better How many
seats in your auditorium

SHOSANNA
Three hundred and fifty

GOEBBELS

Thats almost four hundred less
then The Ritz

Fredrick jumps in

FREDRICK
But beer Goebbels thats not such

a terrible thing You said yourself
you didnt want to indulge every

two faced french bourgeois taking

up space currying favor With less
seats it makes the event more
exclusive Your not trying to fill
the house their fightin g for seats

FREDRICK

(CONT)

Besides to hell with the French
This is a German night a German
event a German celebration This
night is for you me the German
military the high command their
family and friends The only people
who should be allowed in the room
are people who will be moved by

the exploits on screen

Goebbels listens silently then after a bit of a pause

GOEBBELS

I see your public speaking has
improved It appears Ive created
a monster A strangely persuasive
monster When the wars over
politics awaits

Table chuckles

GOEBBELS

Well Private though it is true
Im inclined to indulge you anything
I must watch a film in this young
ladies cinema before I can say
yes or no

(to Shosanna)

So young lady you are to close
your cinema tonight and have

a private screening me

Francesca interprets

GOEBBELS
What German films do you have
Francesca asks

SHOSANNA

My cinema on German night tends
to show older German classics
Francesca interprets

GOEBBELS
Why not my films
Francesca asks
6Z

SHOSANNA

I draw a older German audience in
my cinema that appreciate the
nostalgia of the earlier time
Francesca interprets

GOEBBELS

Thats nonsense fraulein Us Germans
are looking forward not backwards
That era of German cinema is dead
The German cinema I create will not
only be thee cinema of Europe But
the worlds only alternative to the
degenerate Jewish influence of
Hollywood

Fredrick Jumps in

FREDRICK
Along with being a cinema owner
Emmanuelle is quite a formidable
film critic

He chuckles but alone

GOEBBELS

WSo it would appear Unfortunately
for the fraulein Ive outlawed
film criticism

Zoller thinking fast says

FREDRICK

Why dont you screen Lucky Kids
Im sure Emmanuelle hasnt seen it
And its so funny Ive been meaning
to recommend it to her for her
German night Thats a great idea
lets watch Lucky Kids tonight

GOEBBELS

Ahhh Lucky Kids Lucky Kids
Lucky Kids When all is said and
done my most purely enjoyable
production Not only that I
wouldnt be surprised if sixty
years from now Its Lucky Kids
that Im the most remembered for

I know it doesnt seem like it now
but mark my words

Very well Ill have a print sent
over to the frauleins cinema
Well screen Lucky Kids tonight

As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna

the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
filled with the bottom half of a grey SS officer uniform

GOEBBELS

Ah Landa your here this is the

young lady in question

The SS Officer sits down and its our old friend from the
first scene COL HANS LANDA

FREDRICK

Shosanna this4pol Hans Landa of
the SS hell be running security
for the premier

CU SHOSANNA

A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes But if she
gives any indication of this her war story ends here

The SS OFFICER

that murdered her family takes her hand and kisses it
saying in perfect French

COL LANDA
Charmed Mademoiselle

MAJOR HELLSTROM
Better known as The Jew Hunter
The table laughs

GOEBBELS
Oh Francesca what was that funny
thing the Fuhrer said about Hans

FRANCESCA
What thing

GOEBBELS
You know you were there it was a
funny thing the Fuhrer said
about HansSomething about a pig
Francescas memory is jogged

FRANCESCA
Oh yes of course
She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear

6 F

GOEBBELS

Oh yes of course thats it So
the Fuhrer said he wouldnt be
surprised if Hans werent rooting
out Jews like a truffle pig from
the play pen

FRANCESCA
Thats what we need pigs that can
root out Jews

COL LANDA
Who needs pigs when you have me
Big hearty laugh around the table

GOEBBELS
Do you have a engagement tonight

COL LANDA
Well as a matter of fact I do -

GOEBBELS

- Break it Were all going to the
Frauleins cinema tonight to view
Lucky Kids

COL LANDA
Splendid
Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino

INTERRUPTS

FRANCESCA
And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels
to his next appointment

GOEBBELS

Slave driver French slave driver

They all chuckle

Everybody begins to stand up from the table
Francesca gathers the stupid dogs

-as Col Landa stands he says

COL LANDA

Actually in my role as security
chief of this joyous German occasion
Im afraid I must have a word with
Mademoiselle Mimieux

c 5
Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller who
responds

FREDRICK
What sort of discussion

COL LANDA

That sounded suspiciously like a
Private questioning the order of a
Colonel Or am I just being sensitive

FREDRICK

Nothing could be further from the
truth Colonel Your authority is

beyond question

But your reputation does proceed

you Should Mademoiselle Mimieux

or myself be concerned

GOEBBELS

Hans the boy means no harm hes

simply smitten And hes correct

Your reputation does proceed you

Laughter all around The Reich Minister and his axis
entourage

make their way to front of the cafe with the two dumb dogs
on

a leash leading the way
COL LANDA

No need for concern you two

As security chief I simply need
to have a chat with the possible
new venues property owner

FREDRICK

I was just hoping to escort
Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
cinema

GOEBBELS

Nonsense You can eat ice cream

and walk along the Sienne another

time Right now allow Col Landa

to do his job

Everybody saystheir farewells

Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
table in the outside patio area of Maxims

The fluency and poetic proficiency of the SS jew hunters
french revels to the audience that his feigning clumsiness

french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene was
simply a interrogation-technique

bd
They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH

COL LANDA
Have you tried the strudel here

SHOSANNA
No

COL LANDA

Its not so terrible So how is it

the young Private and yourself came

to be acquainted

Shes about to answer when a WAITER approaches

COL LANDA

Yes two strudels one for myself
and one for the mademoiselle A cup
of espresso with a container of
time

to

steamed milk on the side
For the Mademoiselle a glass of milk
Considering Shosanna grew up on a dairy farm and the last

she was on a dairy farm her strudel companion murdered her
entire family his ordering her milk is to say the

least disconcerting

The key to Col Landas power and or charm depending on the
side ones on lies in his ability to convince you hes privy

your secrets

COL LANDA
So Mademoiselle you were beginning
to explain
SHOSANNA
(ANXIOUSLY)

Up untill a couple of days ago

I had no knowledge of Private Zoller
or his exploits To me the Private
was simply just a patron of my cinema
We spoke a few times but -

COL LANDA

- Mademoiselle let me interrupt you

This is a simple formality no

reason for you to feel anxious

The Colonel takes one look at it and says to the Waiter

COL LANDA
I apologize I forgot to order the
cream fresh

WAITER
One moment
He exits

COL LANDA
(Refuring to
the apple pie)
strudels

picking

Wait for the cream
(Back to

BUSINESS)
So Emmanuelle - May I call you
Emmanuelle

SHOSANNA
Oui

COL LANDA

So Emmanuelle explain to me how

does it happen that a young lady

such as your self comes to own a

cinema

The Waiter returns applying cream fresh to the two

The SS Colonel looks across the table at his companion
up his fork he says
COL LANDA

After you
Shosanna takes A¢aA¢a whip creamy bite of strudel Landa

follows her

lead
COL LANDA

(MOUTHFULL

of pie)

Success

Shosanna mouth full of pie indicates she approves

-COL LANDA
Like I said not so terrible
(Back to

BUSINESS)

So you were explaining the origin of
your cinema ownership

SHOSANNA

The cinema originally belonged to

my aunt and uncle -

Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket

COL LANDA
- What is there names

SHOSANNA
Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux
He records the names in his little book

COL LANDA
Where are they now

SHOSANNA
My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg

COL LANDA
Pity Continue

SHOSANNA
Aunt Ada passed away from fever
last spring

COL LANDA
Regrettable

(RESPECTFUL

PAUSE)
Its come to my attention you have
a negro in your employ is that true

SHOSANNA

Yes hes a Frenchman His name is
Marcel He worked with my aunt and
uncle since they opened the cinema
Hes the only other one who works
with me

COL LANDA
Doing what

SHOSANNA
Projectionist

COL LANDA
s he any good

SHOSANNA
The best

COL LANDA

Actually one could see where that
might be a good trade for them
Can you operate the projectors

SHOSANNA
Of course I can

COL LANDA

Knowing the Reich Minister as I do
Im quite positive he wouldnt want
the success or failure of his
illustrious evening dependent on
the prowess of a negro So if it
comes to pass we hold this event
at your venue talented no doubt
as your negro may be you will
operate the projectors Is that
exceptable

As if she has any say

SHOSANNA

Oui

Col Landa takes another bite of strudel Shosanna follows
suit

COL LANDA
So it would appear our young hero is
quite smitten with you

SHOSANNA
Private Zollers feelings for me
arent of a romantic nature

COL LANDA
Mademoiselle

SHOSANNA
Colonel his feelings are not
romantic I remind him of his sister
COL LANDA
That doesnt mean his feelings
arent romantic

SHOSANNA
I remind him of his sister who
raised him

COL LANDA

Its sounding more and more romantic

by the minute

Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case with a

LOGO on it Removing on of the fags he lights it up witha
fancy SS gold lighter He offers one to Shosanna

COL LANDA
Cigarette

SHOSANNA
No thank you

COL LANDA
Do you smoke

SHOSANNA
Yes

COL LANDA

Then I insist you must take one

There not French there German

I hope your not nationalist about

your tobacco to me French cigarettes

are a sin against nicotine

She takes one but makes no move to light it
He inhales deep and says

COL LANDA

I did have some thing else I wanted

to ask you but right now for the

life of me I cant remember what it

is Oh well must not of been important
feet

Col Landa stands up throws some French francs on the table
puts on his grey SS cap touches his finger to his visor
saluting Shosanna and saying

COL LANDA

Till tonight

And with that hes gone

Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief

The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her

ankles and floor We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine
During her conversation and strudel with the man that
exterminated her entire family shosanna pissed herself

She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
feet

While Shosanna sits there pretending

to be amused by the aryan antics of

her

We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes

NARRATOR (VO)

What if tonight accidently the

cinema burned down The Third Reich

propaganda its national hero and

its top jew hunter all in one fell

swoop

She chuckles at the thought though it looks like shes
laughing at the German comedy

file out into the lobby

NARRATOR (VO)

The screening of Lucky Kids was a

complete success And Heer Goebbels

conceded to have the venue changed

to Shosannas cinema Not only that

in a moment of inspiration Heer

Goebbels had a idea

Goebbels speaks GERMAN and Francesca translates

GOEBBELS

I must say I appreciate the modesty
of this auditorium Your Cinema

has real respect almost church like
Not to say we couldnt spruce the
place up a bit In Versailles

theres a crystal chandelier hanging
in the banquet hall that is
extraordinary were going to get it
and hang it from the very middle of
auditorium roof Also I want to go to
Louvre pick up a few Greek nudes

and just scatter them about the lobby

MONTAGE

we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening

The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles

Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre

A truck driving through the french countryside with the

enormous crystal chandelier in the back

The lobby of Shosannas cinema pimped out in Nazi
iconography

WORKERS buzz around decorating The Greek statues are moved

into place

We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty to hoist

the

huge heavy and twinkingly fragile chandelier in Shosannas

auditorium which now resembles something out of one of
Tinto

Brasss Italian B-movie rip offs of Viscontis The
Damned

SHOSANNA

watches all this from a opera box she shakes her head in

disbelief

BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZI S

in the lobby post screening of Lucky Rids shes
soundlessly

escorting them to the door as they make their goodbyes

NARRATOR (VO)

As they left the little French

cinema that night all the Germans

were very happy

We see Private Zoller hanging back so hecan say goodbye
the

looking

NARRATOR (VO)
None more so then Private Zoller
She closes the door on him Watching the Nazis walk into

Paris night Their shadows for a moment onAwall look
like grotesque Nazi charcthers 4644

The Nazis are gone

Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby

down at Shosanna
They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH

MARCEL
What the fuck are we suppose to do

SHOSANNA
It looks like were suppose to have
a Nazi premier

MARCEL
Like I said what the fuck are we
suppose to do

SHOSANNA
Well I need to speak with you
about that

MARCEL
About what

SHOSANNA
About these Hun swine commandeering
our cinema

MARCEL

What about it

She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel She makes him part
his legs and sits on the lower step between his legs Her
back up against his chest his arms around her shoulders
Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel

SHOSANNA
Well when I was watching the bosch
(Said in
ENGLISH)
Capra-corn abomination
(Back to

FRENCH)
I got a idea

MARCEL
Im confused what are we talking
about

SHOSANNA

Filling the cinema with Nazis and
their whores and burning it down
to the ground

MARCEL
Im not talking about that your
talking about that

SHOSANNA

No were talking about that
right now If we can keep this
place from burning down by
ourselves we can burn it down
by ourselves

MARCEL
Shosanna -

SHOSANNA

No Marcel just for sake of argument
if we wanted to burn down the cinema
for any number of reasons you and I
could physically accomplish that no

MARCEL
Oui Shosanna we could do that

SHOSANNA

And with Madame Mimieuxs 350 nitrate
film print collection we wouldnt
even need explosives would we

MARCEL
You mean we wouldnt need any more
explosives

SHOSANNA
Oui thats exactly what I mean
She begins kissing his hands

SHOSANNA

(CONT)

I am going to burn down the cinema
on Nazi night

One of his fingers probes her mouth

SHOSANNA

(CONT)

And if Im going to burn down the

cinema which I am we both know

your not going to let me do it

by myself

The back of her head presses up hard against him as his

hand

both caresses and grips her lovely neck

SHOSANNA

(CONT)

Because you love me And I love you

And your the only person on this earth

I can trust

She then TWISTS around so shes straddling him They are
now

face to face
SHOSANNA

(CONT)

But thats not all were going to do
Does the filmmaking equipment it the
attic still work I know the film
camera does How about the sound
recorder

MARCEL

Quite well actually I recorded a
new guitarist I met in a cafe last
week It works superb Why do we

HICOX

SHOSANNA

Which LtHicox knows enough to mean if Churchell isnt
introduced he aint there

LT HICOX

if you offered me a scotch and plane
water I could drink a scotch and
plain water

GEN FENECH

That a boy Lieutenant Make it
yourself like a good chap

will you Bars in the globe

Hicox heads over to the bar globe

LT HICOX
Something for yourself sir

GEN FENECH
Whiskey straight No junk in it
The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar

busies himself mixing spirits playing bartender chappy
Fenech eyeing the Lieutenants file

GEN FENECH

It says here youve run three
undercover commando operations in
Germany and German occupied
territories Frankfaurt Holland

and Norway to be exact

Back to them mixing drinks he says

LT HICOX
Extraordinary people the Norwegians

GEN FENECH
It says here you speak German fluently
LT HICOX
Like a Katzenjammer Kid

GEN FENECH
And your occupation before the war
His back still to us as he bartends

LT H I COX
Im a film critic

GEN FENECH
List your accomplishments

LT HICOX

Well sir such as they are I write
reviews and articles for a publication
called Films and Filmmakers

As well as our sister publication

T£

GEN FENECH
Whats that called

LT HICOX
Flickers Bi-Monthly And Ive had
two books published

GEN FENECH
Impressive Dont be modest Lieutenant
what are their titles

LT HI COX

The first book was called Art Of The

Eyes The Heart and The MindA Study

of German Cinema in the Twenties

And the second one was called

He turns around with his whiskey and plain water and the
Generals whiskey no junk He finishes what he was saying as
he walks toward the General handing him his drink

LT HICOX
Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci
Its a subtexual film criticism
study of the work of German director
GW Pabst

LT HI COX
What should we drink to sir

GEN FENECH
(Thinking for

a moment)

Down with Hitler

LT HICOX
All the way down sir

GEN FENECH
Are you familiar with German cinema
under the Third Reich

LT HI COX

Yes Obviously I havent seen any of
the films made in the last three
years but I am familiar with it

GEN FENECH
Explain it to me

LT HICOX
Pardon sir

GEN FENECH

This little escapade of ours
requires a knowledge of the German
film industry under the Third Reich
Explain to me UFA under Goebbels

LT HICOX

Goebbels considers the films hes
making to be the beginning of a new
era in German cinema A alternative
to what he considers the Jewish
German intellectual cinema of the
twenties And the Jewish controlled
dogma of Hollywood

SUDDENLY Bellowing from the back of the room

CHURCHELL
Hows he doing

LT H I COX
Frightfully sorry sir once again

CHURCHELL

You say he wants to take on the Jews
at their own game Compared to say
-Louis BMayerhows he doing

LT HICOX

Quite well actually Since Goebbels

has taken over film attendance has
steadily risen in Germany over the

last eight years But Louis BMayer
wouldnt be Goebbels proper opposite
number I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David OSelznick

GenFenech looks to the Prime Minister
With a puff of cigar smoke Churchell says

CHURCHELL
Brief him

GEM FENECH

LtBicox at this point in time Id
like to brief you on Operation Kino
Three days from now Joseph Goebbels is
throwing a gala premier of one of his
new movies in Paris -

LT HICOX
- What film sir
The General has to resort to peeking at his

GEN FENECH
The motion pictures called Nations
Pride

file
LT HICOX
Oh you mean the film about Private
Zoller

GEN FENECH

We dont have any intelligence on
exactly what the film that night
will be about

LT HICOX
But its called Nations Pride

GEN FENECH
Yes

LT HICOX

I can tell you what its about

its about Private Fredrick Zoller

Hes the German SgtYork

Fenech cant help suppress a smile they have the right man

GEN FENECH

In attendance at this joyous Germatic
occasion will be Goebbels Gerring
Boorman and most of the German High
command including all high ranking
officers of both The SS and The
Gestapo As well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry

LT HICOX
The master race at play aye

GEN FENECH
Basically we have all our rotten
eggs in one basket The objective of
Operation Kino Blow up the basket

LT HICOX

(Reciting a

a poem)

and like the snows of yesteryear
gone from this earth Jolly good sir
GEN FENECH

An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines
will be your assist The Germans call
them The Basterds

LT HICOX
The Basterds never heard of them

GEN FENECH

Whole point of the secret service
old boy you not hearing of them
But the Gerrys have heard of them
because these yanks have been them
the devil Their leader is a chap
named LtAldo Raine The Germans
call him Aldo the Apache

LT HICOX
Why do they call him that

GEN FENECH
Best guess is because he removes the
scalps of the Nazi dead

LT HICOX
Scalps sir

GEN FENECH
The hair
He runs his finger along his hairline

GEN FENECH
Like a red Injun

LT HICOX
Rather gruesome sounding little
Dicky bird isnt he

GEN FENECH

No doubt the whole lot a bunch a
nutters But youve heard the
expression It takes a thief

LT HICOX

Indeed

General Fenech continues on with his exposition moving
to a military map

over
9i

GEN FENECH

Youll be dropped into France about
twenty four kilometers outside of Paris
The Basterds will be waiting for you
First thing you go to a little village
called Nadine

(He points it

out on the map)

Apparently the Gerrys never go there
In Nadine theres a tavern called
La Louisiane youll rendez-vous

with our double agent and shell take
it from there Shes the one whos
going to get you in the premiere

It will be you her and two German
born members of the Basterds Shes
also made all the other arrangements
your going to need

LT HICOX
How will I know her

GEN FENECH

I suspect that wont be too much
trouble for you Your contact is
Bridget Von Hammersmark

LT HICOX
Bridget Von Hammersmark The German
movie star is working for England

GEN FENECH

For the last two years now one could
even say Operation Kino was her
brainchild

In the back of the room the bulldog barks

CHURCHELL
Extraordinary women

LT BICOX
Quite

GEN FENECH
Youll go to the premiere as her
escort lucky devil Shell also
have the premiere tickets for the
other two Got the gist

LT HICOX
I think so sir Paris when it sizzles
The three British bulldogs laugh

EXT - CINEMA ROOFTOP - DAY

Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema
literally making a movie
Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA
positioned low looking up

Shosanna the camera subject stands on boxes looking down
into it
A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame
As they always do and always will they speak FRENCH
SUBTITLED into you know what

MARCEL
We need a sync mark

SHOSANNA
What is a sync mark

MARCEL

A action and noise put together
So we can sync up the picture
and sound

SHOSANNA
How do we do that

MARCEL
Clap your hands
She does

MARCEL
In frame imbecile

She claps her hands in front of her face

MARCEL

THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

LOBBY ON THE STAIRS TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA
Big diffrence this time its in COLOR

MARCEL

But how do we get it developed
Only a suicidal idiot like us would
develop that footage How do we get
a35mm print with a soundtrack

SHOSANNA
Do you know one person who can do
both things

MARCEL

Of course Gaspar very nice man

took care of all the experimental
filmmakers But nobody in their

right mind would strike a print of
what your talking about If the
Nazis found out their life wouldnt
be worth this

He snaps his fingers

SHOSANNA

In a wolf fight you ether eat the
wolf or the wolf eats you If were
going to obliterate the Nazis

we have to use their tactics
MARCEL
What does that mean

SHOSANNA

We find somebody who can develop
and process a35mm print And we
make them do it or we kill them
Once we tell them what we want to
do if they refuse we have to kill
them anyway or theyll turn us in

MARCEL
Would you do that

SHOSANNA
Like that
Snaps her fingers

grey
uniform of a SS Lieutenant Hugo Stiglitz sits off by

himself

sharpening his SS DAGGER on his leather belt looped around
his

boot Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening

chapter is dead

LtHicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side
of

the room SHARPENS his dagger menacingly
-Stiglitz is fucking werid
LtHicox approaches Stiglitz

LT NICOX
Stiglitz right

STIGLITZ

Thats right sir

He continues bringing the blades edge up then down on the
leather strap

LT HICOX

LT HICOX

You know were not looking for
trouble right now Were simply
making contact with our agent

Should be uneventful However on

the off chance Im wrong and things
prove eventful I need to know we can
all remain calm

The renegade Gerry Sergeant stops his blades progress and
looks up at the limy Lieutenant

STIGLITZ
I dont look calm to you

LT HICOX

Well now you put it like that

I guess you do

He turns his attention back to his blade
Hicox moves over to Aldo and asks him privately

loquacious type

LT HICOX
Fair point Lieutenant

If Frau Von Hammersmarks cover is
compromised the mission is kaput

SGT DONOWITZ

EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT

The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE sloppily finishes his task
Craming his noodle back in his pants he descends the stairs
that lead him back into the basement tavern We Follow

INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT
-Inside the basement tavern La Louisiane it has a very low
hanging basement ceiling A old looking wood bar off to the
right And the only other space in the little tavern is

taken

up by two large(at least in here) tables which take up both

halfs of the room And despite rumors to the contrary one
of

the two tables is completely filled with drunken
celebrating

Nazi enlisted men of which our urinating friend is one of

five

FIVE NAZIS

ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully
built

stocky type) and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES

The Five Nazis are sitting around the table drinking and

playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of

the hour UFA diva BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK Dressed to the

nines in a chic Forties style womens suit complete with

fedora The game their playing consists of each player
having

a card with the name of a famous person real or imaginary

stuck to their forehead The player doesnt know what name
is

on their forehead So they ask the others questions to
figure

out who they are

The Five Germans five cards read MASTER SGT 1(POLA
NEGRI)

FEMALE SGT 2(BEETHOVEN) GERMAN PRIVATE 3(MATA HARTI)

GERMAN PRIVATE 4 (EDGAR WALLACE) GERMAN PRIVATE 5

(WINNETOU) And Bridget Von Hammersmark who wears her card

in

the brim of her fedora has GENGHIS KHAN
Its German5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions

The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH
Also while some dialogue will be written for the German
Soldiers it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
of their game playing and celebrating

WINNETOU
-okay Im not German Am I American
The whole table bursts out laughing

FEMALE SGTBEETHOVEN
Yes you arel

EDGAR WALLACE
Well not really
SGTPOLA NEGRI

EDGAR WALLACE

English Hes not American Hes
suppose to be American but hes not
a American creation In fact hes
something very different

WINNETOU

Okay Im a fictional literary
character from the past Im American
and thats controversial

BRIDGETGENGUS

No its not controversial The nationally
of the author has nothing to do with

the nationally of the character

The Character is the character

Hamlets not British hes Danish

America

WINNETOU

The table Laughs

The TABLE

WINNETOU
Did Karl May write me
The TABLE

Yes

In the BACKGROUND WE SEE our three counterfeit German

Officers Hicox Wicki and Stiglitz enter the basement

tavern They obviously see the five German soldiers but
their

too far away for us (the audience) to read their face No

doubt their less then happy Fraulein Von Hammersmark

sees them as well Without getting up she waves to them

QZ

BRIDGET

Hello my lovelies I will join you

The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
the game)

Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne

movies

BRIDGET

take in the movies

BRIDGET

The Tableheartily agrees

Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt and does a

and perfectly funny Double Take
The Table loves it

MATA HARI

Mata Hari looks directly at Beethoven and does a Double
Take

EDGER WALLACE

THEN

-Bridget Von Hammersmark rises and excuses herself from the
Table She removes the card stuck in her fedora looking at
the name Gengus Khaun for the first time

BRIDGET
Gengus Khaun I would never of gotten that
She walks over and joins the masquerading Germans table

Gentlemen rise She greets each warmly with a french cheek
kiss as if she knows them well
They all take a seat The two Basterds and one Brit drink
Whiskey The taverns PROPRIETOR a older big bellyed

Frenchman named EARL comes over to the table and pours
more

champagne into Bridgets Champagne glass He leaves
returning

back behind the bar with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID the only
other

person in the establishment

Obviously they speak GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH

LT HICOX
I thought this place was suppose to
have more French then Germans

BRIDGET

Normally thats true The Sgt over
theres wife just had a baby His
commanding officer gave him and his
mates the night off to celebrate

WICXI
We should leave

BRIDGET

F No we should stay For one drink at
least Ive been waiting for you ina
bar it would look strange if we left
before we had a drink

LT HICOX
Shes right just be calm and enjoy
your booze

BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE

The French Barmaid has taken Bridgets place in the
rousing

rowdy game She tells them her person must be French or
she

wont know them Winnetou thinks for a moment then writes a

name on a card The Barmaid puts it on her forehead It
says

NAPOLEON
The Germans all laugh

The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt

The German Master Sgt CLICKS his heels and bows before his
superior officers

no Riefenstahl only Von Hammersmark

The whole room toasts

This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to

table and his men And he almost does but since he
is

drunk and star struck he out wears his welcome

SGTPOLA NEGRI

So Frau Von Hammersmark what brings

exhausted long ago LtHicox butts in

LT HICOX

SGTPOLA NEGRI

Excuse me Capt but your accent is

The whole room pauses-for different reasons

SGTPOLA NEGRI

Where are you from

A silent moment passes between the two tables
German born impostors spring into action

WICKI

such impertinentness

Stiglitz STANDS and YELLS to the other table

STIGLITZ

WHEN

GERMAN VOICE (OS)
Then might I inquire
The Five known Germans move aside reveling the unknown

in the room unseen till now our old friend from before
MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO The Major stands from
the little table he was sitting at

MAJOR HELLSTROM

Like the young newly christened father
I too have a acute ear for accents
And like him I too find yours odd
From where do you hail Capt

Wicki jumps in

WICKI
Major this is highly inappr -

MAJOR HELLSTROM

T wasnt speaking to you
LtSaltzberg

(Turning to

STIGLITZ)
or you ether LtBerlin
(Looking at

HICOX)
I was speaking to Capt I--dont-know-what
The Gestapo Major is now standing beside SgtPola before

impostors table
LtHicox calmly explains his origin
LT HICOX
I was born in the village that rests
in the shadow of Piz Palu

MAJOR HELLSTROM
The mountain

LT HICOX
Yes In that village we all speak like
this Have you seen the Riefenstahl film

MAJOR HELLSTROM

Pabst gave him a Close Up

As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
cigarette holder which Hicox as if on cue lights for her
she says

BRIDGET

Major if my word means anything I can

vouch for everything the Young Capt has

just said He does hail from the bottom

of Piz Palu he was in the film

and his brother is far more handsome

then he

The impostors laugh

Thenso does the Gestapo Major He turns to the Sgt

MAJOR HELLSTROM
You should rejoin your friends
Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do That table

begins playing there game again

Major Hellstrom the highest ranking officer in the room
bows

graciously to the female German celebrity

MAJOR HELLSTROM
May I join you

BRIDGET

By all means Major

The Gestapo Major sits at the table opposite LtHicox and
Wicki The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein

MAJOR HELLSTROM

So thats the source of your bazaar
accent Extraordinary So what are

LT HICOX
Aside from having a drink with the lovely

BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
They continue to have alot of fun playing their game

BACK TO OFFICERS TABLE

MAJOR HELLSTROM

I must say that game their playing

looks like a good bit of fun I didnt
join them because your quite right Capt
officers and enlisted men shouldnt
fraternize But seeing as were all
officers here

(Bowing to

BRIDGET)

-and sophisticated lady friends of

officers What say we play the game

LtHicox begins to refuse when Bridget (feeling she knows
better) interrupts him

BRIDGET
okay one game

MAJOR HELLSTROM

WUNDERBAR
The Major borrows five cards from the other table and lays
them out in front of Bridget and the officers

MAJOR HELLSTROM

So the object of the game is to write
the name of a famous person on your card
Real or fictitious doesnt matter For
instance you could write Confucius or

F
(

He SNAPS his

FINGERS)

Eric More pens

(Back to players)

And they must be famous No Aunt Ingas
When you finish writing put the card

the fuck happened

BRIDGET
The British officer blew his German
act and a Gestapo Major saw it

LT ALDO

fore we get into who shot John

rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch
of Nazis

BRIDGET

I can see since you didnt see
what happened inside the Nazis
being there must look odd

LT ALDO

Yeah we gotta word for that kinda
odd in English its called
suspicious

BRI DGET

Dont let your imagination get the
better of you Lieutenant You met
the sergeant Willi He had a baby
tonight His commanding officer gave
him and his friends the night off to
celebrate The Germans being there
was just a tragic coincidence

Aldo thinks for a moment

LT ALDO
Okay Ill buy that He was ether
there with his men waiting for us
or he was there celebrating his
sons birthday he wasnt doin both

LT ALDO
How did the shootin start

BRIDGET
The English man gave himself away

How did he do that

BRIDGET
He ordered three glasses
She holds up three fingers index to pinky

BRIDGET

is odd Germans would and did notice it

T ALDO

ermans and everything went exactly
he way it was suppose to What would
of been the next step

tQok

BRIDGET

Tuxedos To get them into the
premiere wearing military uniforms

of been suicide But going as
members of the German film industry

changed from The Ritz to a much
smaller venue

LT ALDO

Enormous changes at the last minute
Thats not very Germatic Why the
hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn
peculiar

BRIDGET
It probably has something to do with
the second development

LT ALDO
Which is

FLASH ON
IN A PRIVATE DINNING ROOM IN GERMANY The FUHRER aka Adolph
Hitler aka Adolph Shicklegroover aka The Bohemian

having dinner with Goebbels only a few short days ago
The FUHRER

regards to your Paris premiere of
Nations Pride As the weeks have
gone on and the Americans are on

to think my participation in this
event could be meaningful

BACK TO BRIDGET

BRIDGET

INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT
The pageantry of the evening is in full swing as all the
German beautiful people enter the cinema They mingle in

swastika covered greek nude statue peppered lobby Nazi
Military Commanders High Ranking Party Officials and

Celebrities (Emil tannings Veit Harlin) hob knob and drink
Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
trays

We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
entrance She descends the staircase and busies herself

theatre stuff

At the top of the staircase looking down at the master race
in all there finery is Colonel Hans Landa dressed in his
finest SS Uniform smoking on his Calabash

CAMERA FRAME

directly behind him On the right side we see the figure of
ColLanda from behind watching the guests entering the
cinema On the left side of frame is the cinema entrance
from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
building
Landas

and

again

in

THEN
A THINK BUBBLE like in a comic book appears on the left
side of frame obscuring the cinema entrance Inside of

think bubble a little scene plays out

THINK BUBBLE
Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS NURSES and a
PATIENT in a hospital bed Then ColLanda enters the room

screams at everybody

COLLANDA
I want everybody out of this room
They start to leave

COLLANDA

That means now goddamnit

They RUSH OUT

He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed Its none
other then SGTWILLI and yes hes still alive

Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed sits down

COLLANDA
Can you speak Sgt

L- )1
SGT WILLI

(WEAKLY)
Yes Colonel

COLLANDA

Tell me everything that happened in

The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away reveling the entrance

and as if on perfect cue in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark
dressed lovely leg in a big white cast The three basterds

their tuxedos flank her
CU COLLANDA

smiles

He descends the stairs towards the four saboteurs
They speak in GERMAN SUBTITLED in ENGLISH

COLLANDA

And this was the result

COLLANDA
Mountain climbing Thats how you
injured your leg mountain climbing
BRIDGET
Believe it or not yes it is
A brief moment passes between the two

THEN

The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER So
uproarious

in fact that its quite disconcerting to the four
saboteurs

The Colonel begins to regain his composure

COLLANDA

Forgive me fraulein I dont mean

foolhardy endeavor

The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress

Uncle Gustave when were you climbing
this mountain last night

BRIDGET

This stops her for a seconded

Then Landa laughs it off taking them off the hook

SHOSANNA

(FRENCH)

Donny hands her two tickets She indicates for them to
follow her

Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo

then follow the young french girl into the auditorium

INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and
black

uniforms

Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats

After she points out their seats she turns to leave

Hirschberg

reaches out and grabs her wrist

He looks her in the face and filled with tremendous guilt

because if hes successful tonight hes going to blow this

cute French girl to smithereens he says

HIRSCHBERG
Grazie

13r

The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
boy with slicked back hair that makes him look kind of
Jewish with tremendous guilt knowing if she is successful
tonight shes going to burn him alive and says

SHOSANNA
Prego

BACK TO LOBBY
They begin flicking the lights on and off A GERMAN SOLDIER
YELLS in GERMAN in the lobby
GERMAN SOLDIER

Take your seats The show is about to

begin Everybody take your seatsl

ColLanda LtAldo and Bridget are still together

COLLANDA

(GERMAN)

Von Hammersmark The Fuhrer has
heard your here and he wishes to
commend you personally

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)

(GERMAN)

yet you still show up to toa
important Party event The Fuhrer
was quite adamant in his gratitude
Well use Mademoiselle Mimieuxs office
(To Aldo

in Italian)

Im afraid I must rob you of your
companion but only for a moment

BRIDGET

(ITALIAN)
Yes apparently The Fuhrer wishes
to commend me
saying

COLLANDA

(ITALIAN)

Wait here a moment I promise I wont

detain her long

What are ether of them suppose to do argue

ColLanda goes over to one of the Nazi GAURDUSHER and
whispers in his ear gesturing toward Aldo Like hes

leave the boy alone till we come back Or is he
ColLanda limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office

As Aldo stands in the lobby more and more people enter the
auditorium till its only Aldo and the six Nazi

GaurdUshers

over

in the now vacant lobby

INT - SHOSANNAS OFFICE - NIGHT

Shosannas cinema manager office Its small cluttered and
dominated by a desk

They both enter

ColLanda closes the door behind him and LOCKS IT

Bridget notices but says nothing

Now the two Germans are alone

COLLANDA

Have a seat fraulein

Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk

She lowers herself in the chair

Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk
opposite her The SS Colonel pulls another little chair

and places it in front of the fraulein
He sits Their knees almost touching
The colonel points to the foot not in the cast

COLLANDA

(GERMAN)
Let me see your foot

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
I beg your pardon
enclosed

shoe

1 31
Patting his lap

COL LANDA
Put your foot in my lap

BRIDGET
Colonel you embarrass me

COLLANDA

I assure you fraulein my intention

is not to flirt

Patting his lap more with more aggression

The nervous fraulein lifts up her strapy dress shoe

foot and places it in the Colonels lap

The Colonel very delicately unfastens the thin straps that
hold the frauleins shoe on her foot

-He removes the shoe

Leaving only the frauleins bare foot

THEN
He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket the pretty dress

the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane
He slips it on her foot

-it fits like a glove

Bridget knows shes BUSTED

ColLanda smiles and says in ENGLISH

COL LANDA
Whats that American expression
if the shoe fitsyou must wear it

He removes her foot from his lap
BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
What now Colonel

COL LANDA
(GERMAN)

Do you admit you treachery
She stares defiant daggers into him
MIGHT

THE

on

OF

BRIDGET

(GERMAN)
The only thing I will admit to is
resisting you

(ENGLISH)
Sons-a-bitches

(GERMAN)
-to my last breath

COLLANDA

(GERMAN)
Resist to your last breath

SUDDENLY

Hans LUNGES forward putting his strong mitts around Bridget
Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck and with all the
violence of a Lion in mid-pounce SQUEEZES with all his

Bridgets face turns tomato RED as the VEINS in her face
BULGE and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP

With a violent YANK he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR She TUMBLES
out of the chair Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
throat Nov fully on top of her he BEARS DOWN SQUEEZING
VERY LIFE OUT OF HER Every thing he has he brings to bear
the elegant ladies neck

Then to finally finish her off he begins BANGING THE BACK
HER HEAD HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR

BANG

BANG

BANG

Shes dead

He releases the grip around her throat His hands are

TREMBLING
He rises
Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear

hands

is the most violent act a human being can commit

Also only humans strangle the opposable thumbs being quite

important part of the endeavor As Hans Landa stands the

sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task

still surges through him He tries to gain control of the

trembling that is rippling through his body He takes out a

silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps) and knocks back

a couple of swigs He holds his hand out in front of him
The

TREMBLING is beginning to subside He picks up the
telephone

139-

Into the phone in German he says

COLLANDA

Inform The Fuhrer the audience has

taken there seats and were ready

to begin

Step one in Hans master plan done

He then dials another number

INT - LOBBY - NIGHT

Aldos put up against a wall

Inside the black hood hes SCREAMING every insulting thing
about Germany Germans German food German

COLLANDAS VOICE (OS)

ColLanda now standing directly in front of his hooded
prisoner says in ENGLISH

COLLANDA

LT ALDO
Hans Landa

COLLANDA

Youve had a nice long run Aldo

Alas your now in the hands of the

SS My hands to be exact And theyve

been waiting along time to touch you

He reaches out with his finger and lightly touches Aldos
face right in the middle of the hood

Aldos head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES

COLLANDA
Caught ya flinching
In German he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a

Aldo bound and bagged is put in the truck Also in the
truck is Utivich wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform
bound and bagged like the Lieutenant

The Truck drives off

ColLanda turns around and SEES FROM A DISTANCE Hitlers

Francesca and the rest of the entourage make there way

the red carpet into the cinema
Landa smiles

EXT TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
We see the truck leaving the city of Paris under the veil

INT - TRUCK(MOVING) - NIGHT

The two hooded prisoners bounce along in the back of the

Utivich is crying inside his hood

LT ALDO

hear what kinda sounds he makes
Utivich giggles through the tears

LT ALDO

I just want you to know son I was

real proud of you tonight Learnin

how to drive overnight Driving in

that Limo line You was in the hot

seat son and you stood up real good

Utivich Cries LOUDER

Aldo takes his foot finds Utivichs foot and places his
foot

on top
The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich
n the darkness Utivich has reclaimed his dignity

EXT- COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La
Louisaiane)

The two hooded prisoners are walked inside the
establishment

INT - COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
he hooded men are lead into the closed for business but

-

open

for something else rustic tavern

OThe Nazi Guards unlock the handcuff then sit them down
inchairs

Then simultaneously the hoods are YANKED OFF

The two prisoners are seated at a table in what they can
now

see is a rustic tavern On the table is one telephone one

bottle of Chianti and three glasses And on the opposite
end

of the table sits Colonel Hans Landa

A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at a impressive looking two way
radio set up in the tavern

Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled
discombobulated American soldiers

They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene

COLLANDA
Italian Really

(BEAT)
What could you have possibly been
thinking

LT ALDO
Well I speak alittle Italian -

COLLANDA

I speak a little Tagalog but I
wouldnt begin to presume I could
pass for Filipino Dont get me
wrong I understand you were ina
pickle what with you losing your
Germans And I have nothing but
admiration for improvisation
Still Chico Marx is more
convincing if the three of you had
shown up to the premiere dressed

in womans attire it would have been
more convincing

Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners

COLLANDA

(GERMAN)

You may leave us But stay alert

outside

They exit leaving the Colonel the Lieutenant the
Private and a German Radio Man in the corner

43

COLLANDA
So your Aldo the Apache

LT ALDO
So your The Jew Hunter

COL LANDA

Jew Hunter (pfuit) Im a detective
A damn good detective Finding
people is my specialty So naturally
I worked for the Nazis finding people
And yes some of them were Jews
But Jew Hunter Just the name that stuck

UTIVICH
Well you do hafts admit it is
catchy

COLLANDA

Do you control the nicknames your
enemies bestow on you Aldo the
Apache and The Little Man

UTIVICH
What do you mean The Little Man

COLLANDA
The Germans nickname for you

UTIVICH
The Germans nickname for me is The
Little Man

COL LANDA

Or The Little One ether one means you
And as if to make my point Im

a little surprised how tall you

were in real life I mean your a
little fellow But not circus midget
little as your reputation would
suggest

LT ALDO
Where is my men Where is Bridget
Von Hammersmark

COLLANDA

Bridget Von Hammersmark Oh Im sure
shes in whatever big bubbling
cesspool in hell the devil reserves
for traitors of her ilk

COL LANDA
(CORT)

Well lets just say she got what
she deserved And when you purchase
friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark
you get what you pay for

Now as far as your Pisanos
SgtDonowitz and PtHirschberg-

LT ALDO
How do you know our names

COLLANDA

LtAldo if you dont think I wouldnt
interrogate every single one of your
swastika marked survivors

We simply arent operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed
Now back to the whereabouts of your
two Italian saboteurs At this

moment both Hirschberg and

Donowitz should be sitting in the
very seats we left them in Seats
0023 and 0024 if my memory serves
Explosives still around

there ankle still ready to

explode And your mission some

would call a terrorist plot as of
this moment is still a go

The two Basterds dont believe this It cant be true

LT ALDO
Thats a pretty exciting story
Whats next Eliza on the ice

COLLANDA

However all I have to do is pick
pick up that phone right there
Inform the cinema and your plans
kupet

LT ALDO

IF their still there and IF their
still alive and thats one big IF
there aint no way you gonna take
them boys without settin off them
bombs
COLLANDA

M

I have no doubt and yes some
Germans will die and yes it will
ruin the evening and yes Goebbels
will be very very very mad at you

for what youve done to his big night
But you wont get Hitler you wont
get Goebbels you wont get Gering
and you wont get Boorman And you
need all four to end the war

(PAUSE)

But if I dont pick up that phone

right there you may very well get

all four And if you get all four

you end the wartonight

The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti and fills
three glasses As he pours he says

COLLANDA

So gentlemen lets discuss the

prospect of ending the war-tonight

All three have their Chianti filled glasses

COLLANDA

So the way I see it since Hitlers
death or possible rescue rests
solely on my reactionIf I do
nothing its as if Im causing his
death even more then yourselves
Would you agree

LT ALDO
I guess so

COL LANDA
How about you Uitivich

UITIVICH
I guess so too

COLLANDA

Good we more or less all agree
Gentlemen I have no intention of
Killing Hitler and killing Goebbels
and Killing Gerring and killing
Boorman not to mention winning the
war single handedly for the allies
only later to find myself standing
before a Jewish tribunal

Iq
Now they get it

COLLANDA
If you want to win the war tonight
We have to make a deal

LT ALDO
What kinda deal

COLLANDA

The kind you wouldnt have the
authority to make However Im sure
this mission of yours has a
commanding officer A General Im
betting For

(THINKING)
-OSS would be my guess
Aldos eyebrows reveal that was a good guess

COL LANDA
Oooh thats a bingo Is that the
way you say it Thats a bingo

LT ALDO
You just say bingo

COLLANDA

Bingo How fun But I digress where
were we Oh yes make a deal Over
there is a very capable two way
radio And sitting behind it is a
more then capable radio operator
named Herrman Get me somebody on
the other end of that radio with the
power of the pen to authorize my

- Lets call it the terms of my
conditional surrender if that taste
better going down

Landa with radio headphones over his ears and a microphone

in his hand talks to the UNSEENUNHEARD American Brass on
the

other end

COLLANDA

-So when the military history of
this night is written it will be
recorded that I was part of
Operation Rino from the very
beginning as a double agent
Anything Ive done in my guise as a
SS Colonel was sanctioned by The
OSS as a necessary evil to
establish my cover with The Germans
And it was my placement of
LtRaines dynamite in Hitler and
Goebbels opera box that assured
there demise By the way that last
part is actually true

FLASH ON
Landa placing bomb in Goebbels and Francescas opera box

BACK TO LANDA

COLLANDA

I want my full military pension and
benefits under my proper rank

I want to receive the congregational
medal of honor for my invaluable
assistance in the toppling of the Third
Reich

He looks over and sees Aldo and Uitvich watching the one
sided
conversation

COLLANDA

In fact I want all the members of
Operation Kino to receive the
congregational medal of honor Full
citizenship for myself - but that
goes without saying And I would
like the United States of America to
purchase property for me on
Nantuckett island as a reward for
all the countless lives Ive saved
by bringing the tyranny of the
National Socialist party toa
swifter then imanged end Do you
have all that sir

(PAUSE)
I look forward to seeing you face to

FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
along side Hitler Goebbels Francesca and BOORMAN On
screen
the battle rages He leans over and whispers something in
Goebbels ear we cant hear Goebbels makes a very
sympathetic
face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels) and says in
German

GOEBBELS

Perfectly understandable dear boy

You go now and well see you after

the show

He exits the opera box And walks to the projection booth
door He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way
The door opens just a little bit Shosanna not friendly
stares at him

Be as per usual is all smiles and charm

They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH

FREDRICK

Are you the manager of this cinema
I want my money back That actor in
the movie stinks

He laughs

As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale with all the
charm at his command Shosanna listens knowing the third

is just about over and her big reel change is coming up

FREDRICK

Normally you would beright

And for all the other films I do

I intend to endure evenings like
tonight in the proper sprit
However the fact remains this film
is based on my military exploits
And in this case my exploits
consisted of me killing many men
Consequently the part of the film
thats playing now I dont like
watching this part

SHOSANNA
Fredrick I am sorry but -

FREDRICK

- So I thought Id come up here
and do what I do best annoy you
And from the look on your face it
would appear I havent lost my touch
