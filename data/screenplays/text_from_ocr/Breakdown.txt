EXT BOMBARDED NEIGHBORHOOD (WAR-TORN COUNTRY) - DAY

On the backslope of a mound of rubble a three-man TV
crew (field producer reporter and cameraman all
wearing flak jackets) waits while the cameraman JEFFREY
TAYLOR works to repair his malfunctioning minicam

Throughout this sequence ROD the reporter types on a
laptop computer oblivious to what is happening around
him

HOWARD the field producer lies on his stomach peering
cautiously over the crest of the rubble through
binoculars

Beyond him we see an empty street It is lined with
buildings blasted by shells a sawtooth wall in the
fg a ruined high-rise at the end of the street
billboards in an unrecognizable foreign language

HOWARD
How about it Jeff
Jeff finishes his repair job snaps the minicam closed

JEFF
Done

Jeff slips the knife back in his pocket scrambles over
the loose bricks and stones to a position next to Howard

wall She is young in her early twenties with shining
dark hair down to her shoulders Shes carrying an
armload of books

EXT MOUND OF RUBBLE - DAY

Jeff focuses the minicam

and try to get her and sniper in
the same frame

Jeff turns his head away from the camera and stares at
Howard

Jeff looks to Rod for support but hes busy typing
oblivious

Jeff hesitates then lifts the minicam to his eye again

The woman looks up in Jeffs direction confused
breaking stride --

We hear a burst of automatic gunfire --
RUINED HIGH-RISE
In the window the winking muzzle-flash of the snipers
AK-47
STREET
The womans body jolts from the impact of the bullets
The books go flying from her hand She spins to the
pavement her hair billowing
JEFF

hangs at his side He stares at the dead woman as a pool
of dark blood expands around her body

INT JEFF AND AMYS APARTMENT - NIGHT

A modest apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood Not
much furniture but lots of books and CDs On the
walls blow-ups of arty photographs -- Amy in modeling
poses plus many black-and-white scenery stills

Jeffs bag is unopened on the floor We see two nearly
full wine glasses on a table The CAMERA TRACKS DOWN a
hallway TO the open bedroom door

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

More framed photographs

Amy lies in bed curled up against a pillow The sheets

are tangled in post-coital disarray the only sign of
disorder in this neatly arranged room
CLOSER

Amy stirs reaching her hand out toward the other side of
the bed which is empty She opens her eyes surprised
to find herself alone

Jeff
No reply

Something catches her attention from across the room
She rises pulls a loose robe around herself and pads
over to a closed door She knocks softly

AMY
Can I come in

JEFF (0S)
Sure

INT DARKROOM - NIGHT

A walk-in closet has been converted into a small
photographic darkroom Moist 8 X 10 prints hang froma
clothesline bathed in a warm red glow The images are
moody black and white landscapes

Jeff stands over the developer timing a print Amy
enters through a thick black curtain behind him He
doesnt look up

AMY
Couldnt sleep

Jeff shakes his head Amy looks over his shoulder at a
landscape photograph in the developing tray

AMY
I remember when you took that We

Jeff nods Amy looks at him After a beat

AMY
You want to talk about it

JEFF

Jeff nods
AMY

over it
He says nothing
AMY

It was different this time
He breaks off and pushes through the curtain She
watches him go
CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT

Jeff pours himself a glass of milk Amy enters stands
on the other side of the counter Jeff doesnt meet her
eyes After a beat

JEFF

(a beat)
He thinks I could still get the
job at the San Diego station

AMY
Oh Jeff you didnt

JEFF
Think of it Low pressure a
steady paycheck So I shoot city
council meetings -- how bad could
it be
She looks at him concerned
AMY
Is that what you really want -- or

JEFF
Whos running Its good money

some money in the bank

AMY

She looks at him not understanding He hesitates
JEFF
That girl its like I was
paralyzed I wanted to do

stood there and watched her get
killed

He looks at her emotional

JEFF
Please babe I need this Say
yes and well take as long as you

Amy looks at him considering We hear a faint RUSH OF
WIND Then it gets LOUDER LOUDER and --

Cut TO

EXT CREDIT MONTAGE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - LOW ANGLE -
DAY AND NIGHT

The metallic grill of the Cherokee explodes INTO FRAME as
the car whooshes over us hurtling down the Massachusetts
Turnpike

In a SERIES OF SHOTS with CREDITS OVER we see landmarks
form the cross-country trip a Pennsylvania Dutch
farmhouse a smoke-spewing factory in Ohio the
Mississippi River Kansas wheat fields Loveland Pass and
the Continental Divide

DISSOLVE TO

EXT OPEN DESERT - DAY
The middle of nowhere Sand weeds and sagebrush A
two-lane highway stretches to the horizon like a ribbon

of asphalt

The Cherokee cruises along the road Its Massachusetts
plates seem out of place in this stark landscape
There are no other vehicles

MOVING CLOSER we see that Jeff is driving Amy is sound
asleep in the reclined passenger seat

In back luggage moving boxes camera cases

INT JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY

The AIR CONDITIONING WHISPERS On the console are two
empty Styrofoam McDonalds coffee cups and a state-of-
the-art Nikon Camera

Jeff stretches in the drivers seat He forces his eyes
open fighting sleep He reaches for the coffee cup
its empty He glances into the back of the Jeep There
is a thermos of coffee on the back seat

Keeping one hand on the wheel he reaches for the thermos
and fumbles it to the floor He strains to reach it He
doesnt notice

EXT HIGHWAY - 200 YARDS AHEAD
A slow-moving Dodge Ram pickup truck is approaching the
highway along a small road that cuts across the desert
floor
The pickup equipped with oversized tires roll bar and
a CB whip antenna bounces over the uneven terrain and
turns onto the highway stopping just before entering
Jeffs lane
INT CHEROKEE - DAY
Jeff glances up just in time to see the Ram lurch into
the road in front of him Jeff drops the thermos and

spins the wheel

Amys eyes fly open --

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

The Cherokee goes into a wild looping skid The Ram
jerks to a halt as the Cherokee whips past averting a
collision by inches

INT CHEROKEE - DAY

Jeff expels a breath Amy turns to see the pickup
stopped in the road She looks at him concerned

AMY
Jesus Jeff
JEFF
Sorry I took my eyes off the
road
AMY
(seeing thermos

on floor)
Maybe its time we took a break
you know

Jeff nods looks in the rearview mirror

HIS POV - PICKUP

halted in the middle of the road Inside dimly-visible
through tinted windows are two figures in cowboy hats

The driver leans out the window and gives Jeff the
finger

BACK TO JEFF

angry at himself He looks over at Amy
JEFF
Ill pull over next chance we get
(a beat)
Sorry

He glances in the rearview again still a bit shaken

Cut TO

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

A small desert gas stationmini-mart just off the
highway A sign over the building Last Gas For 30

Miles The Cherokee is parked at the pumps hood
raised

Jeff comes out of the mini-mart carrying a plastic quart

of oil He unscrews the cap and starts to fill the
crankcase careful not to spill on the new engine In
the bg Amy is visible inside the store browsing a

magazine rack

INT CONVENIENCE MART - SAME TIME

Amy thumbs through a cheap tourist guide The Desert
Southwest A TRUCK DRIVER stands nearby perusing the
magazines He glances in Amys direction notices what
shes reading

TRUCKER

Amy looks up at him Hes 50ish plain-looking
friendly wearing a USA logo baseball cap

AMY
Sort of Were moving actually

TRUCKER

Amy hesitates Shes not used to talking with strangers
but the guy seems harmless enough

AMY
California We thought wed take
the scenic route

TRUCKER
Huh In that case you oughta try
the Pass Road bout thirty miles
west Real pretty makes a loop
through the hills then hooks back
up with the highway

Amy smiles politely moves toward the cash register

AMY

husband

The Trucker tips his cap

TRUCKER
Okay then Good luck Enjoy the
rest of your trip

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

As Jeff continues pouring the oil he doesnt notice the
mud-streaked Dodge Ram pickup pulling up to the pumps
behind him The driver EARL climbs out The other man
remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up

Earl is a beefy man about Jeffs age He wears a sweat-
stained Western hat cowboy boots and a T-shirt with the
sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps He
saunters over to the Cherokee stands there a beat
looking over Jeffs shoulder

Jeff senses something behind him turns His eyes widen
as he sees Earl recognizes the pickup as the one he
nearly hit a few minutes before Earl stares at him
unsmiling

EARL
(flatly)
Nice car

Jeff is in an awkward position Hes got a half-full
upside-down bottle of oil in his hands If he lifts it
now hell spill on the engine He turns his gaze back
to the engine decides to keep pouring

JEFF
Thanks

Earl steps around to the open passenger window peers in
Jeff watches him wary

EARL

Air CD leather -- I guess you
sprung for the whole nine yards
JEFF
I guess

EARL
Then again out here what you
really needs a CB radio

JEFF
Is that right
The oil bottle empties out Relieved Jeff pulls it away
and screws back on the crankcase cap He shuts the hood
with a thunk and moves around to the side of the car to
remove the gas nozzle from the tank Earl blocks his
path
EARL
Course if you use a CB you
gotta have a handle
Jeff says nothing This is not a friendly conversation
EARL
How about Shit-for-Brains
(beat)
You damn near killed us back
there boy
JEFF

Look Im sorry I didnt see you
You pulled out in front of me

EARL
The hell I did I saw what
happened

Looking past Earl Jeff sees Amy come out of the mini-
mart with a bag of groceries He speaks carefully
anxious to avoid a confrontation

JEFF
How about if we just forget it
okay Im sorry it happened I
dont want any trouble

EARL
(snorting)
Yeah I bet you dont

Earl glares at Jeff before turning away He passes Amy
gives her a broad smile

EARL
Howdy maam Caught this fellow
tryin to steal your Cherokee

Amy takes in the situation She nods politely Earl
continues into the mini-mart She approaches Jeff
puzzled

AMY
What was that about

JEFF
Nothing Guy in the truck
Thinks I tried to hit him

Jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup who
has not moved during the scene He looks back at the
mini-mart

JEFF
Cmon lets go

AMY
You want me to drive

JEFF
Later Just get in

AMY
Is something wrong

JEFF
No lets just go

Jeff climbs in behind the wheel Amy glances at him and
gets in the car Jeff keys the IGNITION and pulls away

INT CHEROKEE - DRIVING - DAY

As Jeff steers back onto the highway he glances in the
rear-view mirror sees --

MIRROR POV
Earl coming out of the mini-mart staring after the
disappearing Jeep

( )

Jeff shifts in his seat relieved to be getting away from

there Amy watches the speedometer as it climbs to 75
then 80 then 85

AMY
This isnt the Grand Prix you
know
Jeff releases his foot from the accelerator The needle

sinks back down to 65
She gives him a long contemplative look

AMY
Whats bothering you

JEFF
I told you Nothing
(pause)
The guy was an asshole

Keeping an eye on the rear-view mirror Jeff nods toward
the grocery bag trying to change the subject

JEFF
Whatd you get

Amy pulls out an assortment of candy bars and junk food

AMY
Junk food fiesta Sno Balls Yoo
Hoo Moon pies can you believe

JEFF

Cut TO

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - AERIAL - DAY
Far below us the Cherokee traces the empty highway
There are no buildings no houses no other vehicles

DISSOLVE TO

INT CHEROKEE - DRIVING - FEW MINUTES LATER

Jeff drives in silence Amy stares out the window
bored Looking for a distraction she picks up a
cellophane package of doughnuts and peruses the label

AMY

(trying to brighten

the mood)
This is crazy Look at this
Says if you win this mail-in
contest you can choose either
ninety thousand dollars or ninety
thousand doughnuts

She gives him a playful glance

AMY
What would you do with ninety
thousand doughnuts

Jeff shrugs disinterested

JEFF
I dunno Sell em for thirty
cents each and pay off this car

AMY
Very funny
(beat)
Alright what about ninety
thousand dollars What would you
do with that

Jeff stares out the window Hes not into this
JEFF

I dont know Look Amy Im

Suddenly his eyes drop to the console between them --

JEFF
Sonofabitch My camera He
stole my camera

AMY
(startled)

JEFF
The redneck at the gas station
He lifted it right under my nose
My brand new Nikon
(pounds wheel
in frustration)
Goddammit

AMY
Should we go back

JEFF
Whats the use Hes probably

AMY
Look maybe if we call the cops --

Jeff is about to reply when suddenly the car bucks

JEFF
What the hell
The car gives another jolt
AMY
Whatd you do
JEFF

Nothing I --

A warning light flashes on the instrument panel

The

brakes and steering lose power The engine quits cold
JEFF
Hang on -- I cant steer

The CAR bucks and SCREECHES After a few HICCUPS it
jerks to a halt just beyond a crest in the road

For a moment they sit there dazed staring ahead at the
empty road Then Amy notices an object on the floor --
the Nikon She picks it up

AMY
(deadpan)

Found your camera

He rolls his eyes He yanks the hood release and gets
out

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

Steam pours from under the hood of the Cherokee Amy
gets out and looks around at the scorched wasteland
Jeff goes to the front of the car gropes under the hood
for the release latch He yanks his hand away burned by

the hot metal

JEFF
Ow

AMY
Are you okay
JEFF
Im fine
Amy moves to Jeff to examine the burn She reaches out
JEFF

(annoyed)
I said Im fine okay

Jeff lifts the hood examines the engine He tugs ona
cable checks the battery connection and radiator

He goes to the passengers side and takes a hand-held
cellular phone from the glove box He dials zero and
hits send

The PHONE BEEPS

AMY

Out of range

Jeff grunts

tosses the phone on the seat It bounces
and lands on the floor Amy watches as he returns to the
engine and begins unscrewing the radiator cap

AMY

Whats going on Jeff

JEFF

Whats it look like Im trying

to

JEFF

JEFF

(flaring)
Look I really dont want to go

not answering

He stops in mid-sentence There is a RUMBLE in the
distance They look down the road

JEFF
Christ not these guys

JEFFS POV - DODGE RAM PICKUP

approaching fast on the road As it streaks past Earl
yells and launches a beer bottle from the window The
BOTTLE SHATTERS on the asphalt

BACK TO JEFF

watching the Ram speed away

JEFF
Asshole
AMY
(looking down
the road)
Jeff --

A quarter-mile away the pickup is slowing It pulls a
U-turn and stops facing the Cherokee It just sits
there ENGINE IDLING

JEFF
What the hell

AMY
Whats he doing

JEFF
I dont know

Jeff watches the pickup frowning Then from the

opposite direction they hear a LOW RUMBLE They turn
and stare at --

MASSIVE TRACTOR-TRAILER
coming over a crest in the road

Its a huge eighteen-wheeler A white 1988 Peterbilt
It grinds into low gear and slows BRAKES CREAKING

The TRUCK comes to a halt with a HISS of compressed air

DOWN HIGHWAY

the PICKUP STARTS UP again It pulls another U-turn and
drives away melting into the desert

AMY
breathes a sigh of relief

The driver dismounts from the cab leaving the ENGINE
IDLING We recognize him as the Trucker in the mini-
mart He removes his cap revealing a shock of
prematurely white hair He is well-shaven his clothes
immaculate His name is Red

RED (TRUCKER)
You folks all right

JEFF
Yeah Our car broke down

RED
(chuckling)
I figured that much You want a
hand pushing it off the road

JEFF
Thanks Id appreciate it Amy
you want to steer

Amy gets behind the wheel and puts the shift in neutral
Jeff and Red push the car to the shoulder As they push
Jeff glances at the CB antenna on Reds cab

JEFF
Think you could radio a tow truck
for us
RED

I sure would if I could mister
but my CB blew a fuse this
morning Im waiting till I hit
the truck stop on I-40 to get it
fixed

JEFF
How far is that

RED
About 60 miles

JEFF
(disappointed)
Oh

Red walks around to the front of the car and peers down
at the exposed engine

RED
Id offer to take a look but its
hard to say with these new
engines Used to be you could
give em a kick and a holler and
theyd start right up Now its
all computers and chips

JEFF
Its a new car

RED
That could be the problem You
been running it pretty fast

Amy gives Jeff a reprimanding look Its subtle but Red
notices

RED
Tell you what If you want a
ride theres a little diner up
the road Belles They got a
pay phone You could call a tow
truck from there

Jeff considers this glances back to where the Dodge Ram
was last seen

JEFF
Nice of you to offer But weve
got a lot of stuff in the car I
think were better off waiting for
a cop to come along

Amy rolls her eyes Red sees the look trying not to
smile He glances up at a small plane flying overhead

RED
(casually)
Suit yourself Not many cops on
this road thats why the truckers
use it Maybe youll get lucky
(tipping his cap)
Good luck
He turns and heads back toward his truck Amy looks at
Jeff She waits till the trucker is out of earshot
AMY
Are you nuts
JEFF
We dont know this guy
AMY
Hes offering to help It could
be hours before anyone else comes
along Its 100 degrees You
really want to be stuck out here
JEFF
Amy Ive got my equipment in the
car All our stuff What if
those guys come back and were not
here
(turns away
quietly to
himself)
Jesus dont be stupid
Amy hears this Shes had enough Flares
AMY
Stupid is sitting out here waiting
for a cop when we already have a
ride
In the bg the TRUCK is THROTTLING UP Then mad and

careless

AMY
Stupid was letting you talk me

into leaving Boston

She turns away The truck starts to pull out She bites
her lip thinking then steps into the road and flags the
truck down Red brakes

AMY
Excuse me Do you think you could
drop me at that diner

RED
(surprised)
Sure thing How about you
mister I could take you both
just as easy

AMY
Thats okay My husband wants to
stay with the car Ill just get
my purse

She goes to the passenger side of the Jeep for her purse
Jeff follows lowering his voice

JEFF
What do you think youre doing

AMY
Im going to the diner Im going
to call a tow truck Then Im
going to order an iced tea and
wait Good-bye Jeff

JEFF
(firm)
Youre not riding with that guy
End of story

AMY
You wanted to be alone Well
youre alone Why dont you take
the time to get your head
together

She walks to the truck Jeff stands there She climbs
into the cab Red moves some papers out of the way
RED
Watch your step maam

She pulls the door shut The TRUCK THROTTLES UP and
pulls away Jeff watches the truck dwindle in the
distance flashers blinking After a beat the flashers

cease

SLOW DISSOLVE TO

EXT ROADSIDE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER
Beneath a blazing sun Jeff paces restlessly in front of
the Cherokee checking his watch wiping beads of sweat
from his face He looks down the highway

Nothing in sight Extremely bored he wanders over to
the raised hood and studies the engine again

After a few moments something catches his eye Curious
he kneels down and peers under the chassis He frowns
JEFFS POV - LOOSE WIRE

dangling under the engine

BACK TO JEFF

JEFF
Oh for Christs sake

He pulls his Swiss Army knife from his pocket and slides
under the car Working with the screwdriver blade of the
knife he reconnects the plug to its socket In the
process his hands and shirt become stained with grease

Jeff slides out from under the car brushes himself off
and gets behind the wheel He tosses the Swiss Army
knife on the center console and keys the ignition The
ENGINE ROARS to life

HIGHWAY

Jeff slips in ahead of the Peterbilt then starts weaving
and braking forcing the truck to slow
( )

Both vehicles pull to the side of the road and stop
Jeff leaps out of the Cherokee and runs over as Red

climbs down from the empty cab

(NOTE Throughout this scene various cars and trucks
pass in either direction)

RED
Jesus pal what the hell you
doing

JEFF

I was signaling you to stop
Didnt you see me

RED
No
Jeff reacts How thick can this guy be
JEFF

Wheres my wife

RED
Huh
JEFF
My wife Where is she

Red gives him a puzzled look

RED
How should I know where your wife
is
JEFF
I checked at the diner No one
saw her there
RED

Mister I dont know what youre
talking about

Jeff stares -- is this guy nuts
JEFF
You gave her a ride You were
supposed to drop her at Belles
diner

Red searches his memory trying to be as helpful as
possible He shakes his head

Nope Sorry

JEFF
How can you not remember It was
just half an hour ago for
chrissakes

Red gives him a peculiar look

RED
Mister I never seen you before in
my life

Suddenly there is a loud SQUAWK from inside the cab --
the CB RADIO

CB VOICE (VO)

(filtered)
Breaker breaker -- Iron Man you
copy
JEFF
(reacts)

Your radio works --
(locks eyes with Red)
What the hell are you doing --
Jeff freaks out circling the truck calling loudly

JEFF
Amy Amy You in there

Red shrinks back unnerved

RED
Look mister I dont know what

you want but --

JEFF
I want my fucking wife is what I
want What have you done to her

Reds eyes dart to something in the distance Jeff
catches this turns

SHERIFFS PATROL CAR
Cruising toward them

Jeff runs into the middle of the road and waves
frantically The patrol car switches on its flash bar
and speeds up pulling to a stop behind the Peterbilt

SHERIFF BOYD 50ish climbs out sizing up the situation
Jeff runs over

JEFF
Officer I need your help

SHERIFF BOYD
Whats your problem

JEFF
I dont know this guy has my
wife

SHERIFF BOYD

Jeff catches his breath

JEFF
I dont know what the hells going
on Last time I saw her she was
with this guy in his truck Now
hes saying hes never seen her

RED
Officer hes crazy -- I dont

JEFF
Dont lie you son of a bitch

The Sheriff unsnaps the safety strap on his holster
just a precaution

SHERIFF BOYD

All right -- everybody just calm

(to Jeff)
Sir you want to tell me what

JEFF

Our car broke down This guy

hollering about his wife I

SHERIFF BOYD

The Sheriff takes a long look at both of them unsure
what to think He turns back to Red

SHERIFF BOYD

RED

Red Barr

(pulls out his

wallet)

SHERIFF BOYD

As Red closes his wallet several credit cards fall to
the ground He bends to scoop them up Jeff eyes this

suspiciously

The Sheriff climbs up into the truck

INT PETERBILT CAB - DAY
The Sheriff pokes his head inside looks around
Pretty much what youd expect in a long-haul big rig
a CB radio a plastic Jesus a map of the US taped to
the ceiling with hundreds of magic marker Xs showing
where the truck has been

( )

The Sheriff looks into the sleeping area behind A
blanket is folded over a foam mattress A stained pillow
rests on top

EXT PETERBILT - DAY

Jeff and Red keep a careful eye on each other as the
Sheriff climbs down from the cab wiping his hands

SHERIFF BOYD
(to both of them)
All right lets see your license
and registration

Jeff and Red fish into their wallets and hand over
IDs The Sheriff examines them comparing faces to
pictures and writing down names

SHERIFF BOYD
What are you hauling today Mr

Barr

RED
Nothing empty load Im heading
to Fresno for a pick up -- ball

bearings or something

SHERIFF BOYD
(eyeing him)
Long way to go empty

RED
Tell me about it Too much
competition nowadays One horse

payin job

JEFF
(to Sheriff
impatient)
Are we gonna keep looking or what

The Sheriff hands back the IDs

SHERIFF BOYD
Yes we are
(to Red)
Sir Im gonna have to see
everything

RED
No problem I understand

EXT REAR OF PETERBILT - DAY
Jeff and the Sheriff observe as Red unlatches two heavy

padlocks Grunting he raises the slatted METAL DOOR
It retracts along the ceiling with a noisy RATTLE

INSIDE

The cavernous interior is mostly empty except for a few
randomly strewn cardboard boxes too small to contain a
person

SHERIFF BOYD
(re boxes)
Those yours

RED
Yeah Personal stuff Clothes
and whatnot You want to take a
look

The Sheriff considers it shakes his head

SHERIFF BOYD
No I think were pretty much
done here Youre free to go

JEFF
(reacts)
Whoa whoa -- wait a sec Thats
it Youre not going to question
him anymore

SHERIFF BOYD
Sir I searched the truck
Theres no evidence of suspicious
activity no sign of struggle

Red has been looking on He chimes in trying to be
helpful

RED
Look I dont mean to butt in but
maybe you got my truck confused
with someone elses

JEFF

(lunges)
Go to hell you sonofabitch --
The Sheriff grabs Jeff holds him back

SHERIFF BOYD
Hey Hey You want to get
arrested Now the man has a
point This is a plain-looking
John Doe truck Maybe you did get
them mixed up

Jeff stares at the Sheriff a beat then bolts suddenly
for the front of the truck He yanks open the door and
leaps up into the cab

SHERIFF BOYD
Hey

The Sheriff jogs after him Red walks to the cab
unconcerned

INT PETERBILT CAB - DAY

Jeff searches the cab for signs of Amy He tosses aside
a jacket rifles papers on the floor There is nothing

EXT CAB - DAY

Sheriff Boyd looks up sternly as Jeff continues searching
the cab Red watches calmly

SHERIFF BOYD
Mr Taylor either you come down
from there or Im going to have to
arrest you

Jeff gives up reluctantly He looks lame and desperate
and he knows it He steps down from the cab gritting
his teeth

JEFF
It was him It was this truck

SHERIFF BOYD
Uh-huh I can see that Did you
get a license plate

Jeff stares at him knows where this is going

JEFF
No

SHERIFF BOYD

JEFF
I wasnt paying attention

The Sheriff studies him a beat nods

SHERIFF BOYD
Mr Taylor did you by any chance

JEFF
What does that have to do with
anything

SHERIFF BOYD
Well for starters maybe she left
you

JEFF
I dont believe this

SHERIFF BOYD
Ive seen it a hundred times
Lovers married couples gay guys

Jeff stares at the cop Emphatic

JEFF
My wife did not leave me

RED
(cuts in)
Officer Im sorry Id like to

SHERIFF BOYD

SHERIFF BOYD

( )

RED
Much obliged
(to Jeff)

Good luck findin your wife

mister No hard feelings
Red climbs into the cab Jeff watches helplessly
resigned to the fact theres nothing more he can do The
Sheriff goes to the cruiser and speaks on the radio As

the truck drives off Jeff goes over to the cruiser

SHERIFF BOYD
Sir I believe you that your wife
is missing Maybe you got
confused about what truck she got
into maybe you had a fight -- you

He hands Jeff a card with an address printed on it

SHERIFF BOYD
The town of Bracketts 31 miles
that way My deputys name is Len
Carver Hes a good man Hell

forms if you want to report your
wife missing

Jeff clenches his jaw as the words sink in The Sheriff
softens his tone sympathetic

SHERIFF BOYD
If you want my opinion your wife
is probably around here Lost or
plenty pissed off and giving you a
scare Either way shell turn
up
As Jeff stares at the Sheriff the police RADIO SQUAWKS

DISPATCHER (VO)

The Sheriff shifts into gear and drives away Jeff is
left standing on the side of the road desert in all

directions

Cut TO

INT POLICE STATION - DAY

A wall is covered with missing persons notices
Photographs of men women and children stare back at us
Names and dates are printed across the bottom of the
notices

PULL BACK to reveal Jeff staring at the gallery of faces
Its a creepy feeling Several yards away DEPUTY LEN
CARVER a young puffy-faced lawman sits at a desk
filling out a form Jeff looks shaken

DEPUTY CARVER
Is this a recent picture

Jeff glances over Deputy Carver is holding up a wallet-
sized photograph of Amy

JEFF
Two months old

DEPUTY CARVER
She still wear her hair like that

JEFF
Yes

The Deputy resumes filling out the form He clicks his

tongue sympathetically

DEPUTY CARVER
Well certainly do our best Mr
Taylor Theres over a hundred
thousand people go missing in this
country every year Runaways
deadbeat dads dropouts folks
hiding from the IRS -- all
vanishing without a trace

Jeff stares at the faces

DEPUTY CARVER
Now Im not saying shes one of
them I sure hope not But
unless theres a ransom demand or
evidence of forced abduction
believe me the FBI wont even
look at your case till its been
24 hours
Deputy Carver finishes the paperwork and staples the

photograph to the form He looks up at Jeff
DEPUTY CARVER
Nevertheless well sure keep our

eyes peeled Hows that sound

Jeff clenches his jaw

Cut TO

EXT ROOF OF BELLES DINER - DAY

From this high vantage point we see Jeffs car
approaching

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

The Cherokee pulls up to the side of the building Jeff
gets out and walks inside
INT BELLES DINER - DAY
Jeff enters looks around Its the same scene as
before same Bartender a slightly different cast of
characters
No sign of Amy

Jeff advances to the Bartender who stands at a sink

rinsing beer mugs

JEFF
Did she come in

BARTENDER
(looks up uninterested)
Didnt see her

JEFF
You didnt see her or she didnt
come in
BARTENDER
Buddy I told you the last time
Im busy Maybe she came in
maybe she didnt All I know is
I didnt see her

Jeff looks around not particularly trusting the
Bartenders skills of observation He grinds his jaw

The other customers at the bar have been watching all
this One of them an older grizzled BARFLY looks up at
Jeff

BARFLY
(confidentially)
None of my business mister But
if I was you Id take a look in
the ladies room

The Barfly gives Jeff a wink and turns back to his beer
Snickers from some of his bar mates who avert their eyes
when Jeff glances at them Jeff knows this is almost
certainly a put-on but he cant take a chance

While the Barflies watch poker-faced Jeff walks to the
door of the ladies room hesitates then knocks His
knock is answered by a wordless sound HALF-GROAN HALF-
GASP

JEFF
Amy

Silence Jeff tries the door Its locked He rattles

it Another GROAN Jeff puts his shoulder against the

door heaves inward The door swings open revealing --

INSIDE BATHROOM

Flo bent over the toilet vomiting She whirls around
a strand of spittle dangling from her lip

FLO
Hey -- what the hell you doing

Jeff backs away yanks the door shut The barflies
chuckle among themselves

Jeff strides angrily for the exit He stops at the door
takes one last look around No one seems to be paying
him much attention He turns to leave

but something stops him He cant put his finger on
it Theres something wrong here

He stares at the other customers Why do they avoid eye
contact Are they hiding something

He scrutinizes more closely

There is the gruff trucker sitting at a nearby table
shoveling food in his mouth Hes been averting his gaze
ever since Jeff walked in

And then theres the traveling salesman Overweight
sweaty Popping vitamins along with his coffee

Or what about the shirtless biker reading a comic book
at the bar Probably an ex-con

While Jeff is running these suspicions through his mind
a trucker approaches the counter to place an order The
Bartender jots it down on a pad then tears off the
carbon slip He places one copy above the grill and
another in a pile by the cash register

Jeff stares an idea forming
He approaches the bar

JEFF
I want to see your order slips

BARTENDER
What
JEFF
You write down the names I want
to see them
BARTENDER

What are you nuts I dont have
to show you jack shit

Jeff leans in his face
JEFF
If my wife came in here then her
names in that pile

The Bartender stiffens stares him straight in the eye

BARTENDER
You calling me a liar

A tense beat
Possessed by a sudden impulse Jeff makes a grab for the

receipts Before he can reach them the Bartenders hand
clamps onto his

BARTENDER
Mister Ive had just about enough
of you

JEFF

Let me see the fucking slips

In one swift motion Jeff overpowers the man and extracts
the receipts He starts going through them fast
looking at names TULLY MARK FLO ANDY and

Jeff raises his eyes to face the unpleasant end of a
Smith and Wesson revolver

BARTENDER
Now mister youre going to have
to leave

Jeff takes a step back Everyone in the diner is
staring He stumbles backwards heads for the exit
EXT BELLES DINER - DAY

Jeff exits breathing hard and runs to the phone booth

PHONE BOOTH

is occupied by a YOUNG MAN with an awkward oversized
frame ill-fitting clothes Jeff raps on the glass
anxiously

JEFF
Please I need the phone -- I have
to call the police

The Man looks up dull and glassy-eyed His sluggish
demeanor suggests mental retardation He hangs up and
slowly opens the door

SLUGGISH MAN
(drawls)
My names Billy You the feller
lookin for his wife

JEFF
Howd you know Did you see her

The Sluggish Man hesitates Theres something holding
him back Jeff senses this

JEFF
Please if you know something

BILLY (SLUGGISH MAN)
(a beat)

JEFF
What When

Billy is about to answer In bg the Bartender sticks
his head out of the diner Billy backs away spooked

BILLY
Oh man Never shoulda opened my
damn mouth Now Im gonna git it

Billy breaks into a loping run through the parking lot
Jeff hurries after him and catches up cornering Billy
between two cars trying to calm him

JEFF
No ones going to hurt you Billy
Just tell me what you saw

Billy glances around nervously swallowing

BILLY
She came in on a truck A big
white one
JEFF

of a pocket address book He picks up the handheld

cellular phone and dials

Cmon work goddammit

The highway intersects Route 7 The Cherokee slows just
enough to take the corner without tipping over

It flies past a sign Route 7 - North

EXT ROUTE 7 - DAY

The road ascends into the rocky hills above the desert
plain The route is narrow and windy forcing Jeff to
reduce his speed

Jeff drives desperately searching for any sign of a

He keeps pressing the REDIAL button The NO SERVICE
INDICATOR BEEPS over and over

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY

The road curves through a tunnel then climbs higher

past sharp cliffs and drop-offs Jeff follows the signs
for Route 7

INT CHEROKEE - DAY

Something catches Jeffs eye on the cell phone For the

first time the SERVICE indicator blinks green Jeff
immediately grabs the phone again and presses REDIAL

There is a burst of STATIC then we hear a SCRATCHY
RINGING The call is going through
JEFF
(thank God)
Yes
He waits for an answer
JEFF
Hello Steve Its Jeff Taylor

JEFF

The SIGNAL CUTS OFF Jeff slams the phone against the
dash furious
JEFF

Goddammit
He punches redial gets the NO SERVICE BEEPING then
glances up sees a --
CHAINLINK FENCE
covered with high-visibility markers stretched across the
road The sign ROAD CLOSED
BACK TO JEFF

He mashes the brakes The CHEROKEE SKIDS to a halt just
short of the fence Jeff stares at it

JEFF
Shit

He grinds his teeth Beyond the padlocked gate the
highway continues as an unpaved dirt road

He deliberates then throws the Cherokee in reverse and
does a three-point turn so hes facing back in the

opposite direction

He looks up sees --

DODGE RAM PICKUP TRUCK
has been hiding in the bushes off the road It lurches
forward and stops in the middle of the road blocking
Jeffs escape Jeffs eyes widen in fear as he
recognizes the vehicle and its driver Earl

Earl gets out of the cab with a hunting rifle He raises
it to his shoulder

EARL
(calling out)
Out of the car Put your hands
where I can see em

JEFF

swears panicking

EARL
I said get out dammit Now
Jeff stares into the rifle deliberating His hand moves

to the gearshift

He jerks it into reverse and floors the gas

CHEROKEE

peels out in reverse snaking wildly side to side aiming
for the chainlink fence

It BURSTS the FENCE Poles and chain mesh go flying

JEFF

cranks the wheel and brakes hard The rear end of the
Cherokee swings wide to the edge of the road

He throws the shift into drive and punches the throttle

EARL

jumps in the Ram and takes off in pursuit

JEFF

GUNS the ENGINE The Cherokee bounces wildly on the
rutted storm-damaged road He yanks the four-wheel-
drive lever

DIRT ROAD

The huge pickup streaks after the Cherokee its 75-LITER
V10 ROARING oversized tires devouring the terrain
JEFF

GUNS the ENGINE on the washboard road surface the
vibration nearly shaking the suspension apart while --
RAM

keeps pace in the dust from its wake Inside the cab
Earl can be seen speaking on a CB transmitter

JEFF

throws the Cherokee into a sharp turn in the road As
the car rounds the bend he looks up reacting as --
IDLED BULLDOZER

blocks the road at a construction site More unattended
earthmoving equipment fills the road beyond

JEFF

brakes wildly To his right a cliff goes straight up
on the left a guardrail protects a steep ravine

He cuts the wheel left CRASHES through the GUARDRAIL and
plunges into the ravine
CHEROKEE

bounces wildly as it hurtles down the slope CRASHING
through sagebrush and manzanita

JEFF
clings to the wheel tossed about violently as suitcases
and packing boxes go everywhere

The Cherokee hits a bump on the steep slope and CRASHES
through the upper branches of a willow grove

As the leaves part we see a river

CHEROKEE

lands on the passenger side with a SPLASH and comes to
rest half-submerged in the RUSHING WATER

EARL

jerks the Ram to a halt leaps out and runs to the edge
of the road to look down on the Cherokee in the river

EARL
Sonofabitch

He grabs the rifle and begins making his way down the
slope

INSIDE CHEROKEE

The world is sideways Water rushes into the car Jeff
is strapped into the drivers seat by the seatbelt The

AIRBAG DEFLATES with a HISS

Jeff grimaces in pain He looks around blinking The
river is flowing right through the Cherokee

Luggage styrofoam hamburger clamshells and empty Coke
cans bob on the surface of the water

Jeff fumbles with the seatbelt release The belt comes
free and he drops suddenly into the water on the

passenger side

He gets to his feet reaches overhead to unlatch the
drivers side door and pushes it open

He hoists himself through the door

RIVERBANK

Earl sees Jeff emerging from the half-submerged Cherokee
levels the RIFLE and FIRES

JEFF
ducks back inside the Cherokee freaking
The passenger side is on the river-bottom and if he tries
to get out through the drivers side hes a sitting

duck

Jeff swears and looks around seeing a metal camera case
underwater in the back seat

He grabs the case and swings it at the windshield The
first three blows bounce off harmlessly

Then the WINDSHIELD SHATTERS with a CRASH

He takes a deep breath submerges and swims underwater
through the broken windshield

ON BANK

Earl stiffens as he sees movement in the water Several
items of debris from the car are floating on the current

EARL
Fuck

He begins moving downstream along the bank eyeing the
river

UNDERWATER

Jeff breaststrokes for all hes worth Sand swirls in
the swift current He pushes away from a boulder in his
path

He swims until his lungs are bursting then surfaces for
air

ON BANK

Earl sees Jeff break the surface He aims the RIFLE and
FIRES A BULLET SMACKS the WATER near Jeffs head

Then Jeff is under again
Goddammit

UNDERWATER

Jeff struggles to stay in control The current is
turning swifter His shoulder glances painfully off a
boulder

ON BANK

Earl works his way through the brush at the rivers edge
His foot lands between two rocks He pulls it out
swearing

BEHIND ROCK

Jeff surfaces and gulps in air staying out of sight of
Earl on the bank Then he is down again

ON BANK

Earl works his way along the shore Up ahead the river
runs over rapids before passing around a bend

Earl hears an ENGINE and turns A huge moving van has
arrived on the dirt road overlooking the ravine

He shouts to the DRIVER pointing downriver

EARL
Hes getting away

The Driver shouts something inaudible Earl runs along
the bank ducking under low-hanging branches

IN RAPIDS

Jeff is carried over the rocks by the fast-moving
current He slams into a boulder letting out a cry and

swallowing a mouthful of water

A downed tree hangs over the river Jeff grabs
desperately and takes hold of a branch Hes got it
Hanging on to the branch he notices a familiar object
floating past in the water the 90000 Donuts pack

Jeff tries to haul himself from the river The BRANCH
bends under his weight Then it comes free with a CRACK

Jeff is carried downstream on the rushing water

ON BANK

Earl works his way along the shore The unseen Driver of
the van shouts to him from upriver

DRIVER OF VAN (0S)
Where is he

EARL

Hes in the water I just saw

him
BELOW RAPIDS
The river has turned slow again

Jeff fights to his feet in the shallows and staggers to
the bank He drops to his knees retching

Clutching his ribs he raises his head and looks upriver
For the moment there is no sign of Earl But he could
appear anytime

Jeff gets to his feet wincing He looks up at the rocky
canyon wall bordering the river Its steep but

scalable

He begins climbing

DISSOLVE TO

EXT ROCK OUTCROPPING - MINUTES LATER

Jeff has climbed to higher ground He lies flat on his
belly and peers THROUGH a gap in the rocks at the river
valley below

JEFFS POV - RIVER
The men have given up their pursuit

The moving van a jumbo three-axle GMC has turned around
and backed up to the edge of the ravine

A stocky man AL (whom we recognize as Earls passenger
at the minimart) operates a gas-powered winch in the

cargo door of the van

A cable runs from the winch down to the Cherokee in the
river

Standing knee-deep in the current Earl signals to Al
while the winch slowly tugs the Cherokee onto its wheels
then backwards out of the river

BACK TO JEFF

watching in amazement He can hear only snatches of
their conversation

AL
cant believe you let him get
away
EARL
You try chasing through this
shit
AL
Fuck this is what happens when

you get one without the other

Jeff cant believe it The Cherokee is being pulled
backwards up the slope toward the road

He belly-crawls back from the outcropping gets to his
feet and climbs higher

Cut TO

EXT ANOTHER PART OF CLIFF - LATER

Jeff has moved to higher ground He crouches behind a
stand of manzanita and looks down at the activity below

JEFFS POV - ROAD

The Cherokee is now back on the road

Operating the winch with precision efficiency Earl and
Al drag the Cherokee up a ramp into the rear of the
moving van

Once the vehicle is aboard they stow the ramp and close
the van doors

BACK TO JEFF

watching in amazement straining to hear what Earl and Al
are saying Behind Jeff a PEBBLE SKITTERS on the rock

He turns reacts

Its Billy -- the halfwit from the diner Wielding a
shotgun like a club he swings the butt at Jeffs skull

Jeff drops to the ground unconscious
CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN

There is a CREAK as the TRUNK opens Jeff lies inside
dazed and disoriented blinking into the sun His eyes
wont focus Earl and Billy stand over the trunk in
silhouette He can hear their voices

EARL

BILLY
Should be I clocked him pretty
good

A gun barrel jabs Jeff in the ribs

BILLY
Rise and shine dad
Jeff blinks A face slowly comes INTO FOCUS

BILLY
Cmon shake a leg

Jeff looks at Billy Nothing makes sense anymore But
one thing is clear Billys mental retardation was all

an act

JEFF

(turning)
What do you think Earl

EARL

Billy nods disappointed

BILLY
Yeah I suppose Too bad
(peers down at Jeff)
Guess youre not the donut magnate

(to Earl)
Waste of time Plug him

Earl raises a pistol Jeffs eyes flash
JEFF
(blurting out)
Ninety thousand

Earl stops glances at Billy They both eye Jeff
carefully

BILLY
Say again
JEFF
(emphatic)

Ninety thousand dollars

A faint smile plays on Billys lips He slams the trunk

INT CAR TRUNK - DAY

Its nearly pitch black A beam of sunlight shines
through a rusted hole It illuminates Jeffs eyes

The car shifts into gear and sets off across the desert
Jeff grunts as the car bounces on the uneven terrain

He braces against the confines of the trunk The ENGINE
NOISE is deafening The car hits a depression and
jounces wildly Jeff is thrown about violently
CUT TO

EXT MESA OVERLOOK - DAY

There is a CREAK and the TRUNK opens Jeff squints into
the sun Earl and Billy stand over the trunk

EARL

Get out Dont try anything

stupid
Jeff gets out grimacing His clothes are stained with
grease and tire grime He sets his feet unsteadily on
the ground looks around We see that he has been
confined in the trunk of a Pontiac Firebird
The Firebird and Dodge Ram are parked on a bluff Red
stands on the highest point peering through binoculars

at the desert below He glances at Jeff

RED
Youre a tough man to get a hold
of Jeffrey

Jeff stares a mix of emotions -- anger fear confusion

JEFF
(barely able to
control himself)
What do you want

RED
Its not me were talking about
Question is what you want

Jeff looks at him with loathing

RED
See Ive got something you might

five hundred and fifteen pounds

He advances toward Red Billy and Earl grab him from

Jeff walks along the road carrying the envelope
Various cars pass in either direction but none slow
down

Jeff stiffens as an 18-wheeler approaches But the TRUCK
THUNDERS past blowing a cloud of dust and sand in his
face

Jeff continues walking anxiously checking over his
shoulder every few moments His eyes narrow

The Dodge Ram pickup is cruising toward him It slows
then brakes to a halt The passenger door opens Earl
sits behind the wheel aiming an automatic pistol

EARL
Toss the envelope on the seat

Jeff stands firm

JEFF
No First you tell me where she
is

EARL
Wrong asshole First you give me
the money then you find out
Unless you want me to shoot you
dead right here on the highway

Jeff looks around wonders if Earl would risk shooting
him in view of passing traffic

Jeff hesitates then tosses the envelope on the seat
Earl opens it reaches in and pulls out several packets
of currency They are wrapped with paper bands and
appear to be stacks of fifties and hundreds He replaces
them and gestures at Jeff with the gun

EARL
Now lift your shirt and jacket and
turn around

Jeff complies Earl sees that he isnt carrying a gun
He beckons Jeff toward the truck with the automatic

EARL
Turn around hands behind your
back and step toward the truck

Jeff takes two backwards steps toward the passenger side
door Earl grabs his arms yanks roughly and wraps them
with several layers of duct tape

EARL
Now get up in the truck knees on
the floor Do it now

Jeff struggles into an awkward kneeling position on the
floor facing the rear of the pickup his belly pressed

against the seat

Earl reaches over and pulls the door shut He throws the
truck in gear and starts driving Jeff grimaces looking
up at him

JEFF
I gave you the money Now let her

EARL
Let her go Do I look like I

a RINGING sound and Earl pulls a CELL PHONE from his
pocket He presses a button and raises it to his face

across the temple Jeff slams into the passenger door

wincing

EARL
Id have loved to see the look on
your face when that car seized up

driver)
Help help I aint got no power

Earl laughs Jeff has come to rest with his back against
the door By contorting his arms he is able to draw the
letter opener from his pocket

He manipulates the letter opener into position and begins
cutting the duct tape that binds his wrists

Steering with one hand Earl reaches into the envelope
pulls out a packet of bills and waves it in Jeffs face
Jeff saws faster at the duct tape

EARL
You know what Im gonna do first

Jeff glares at him

EARL

under his nose)

Earl laughs obscenely He riffles the bills under his
nose again then stops abruptly frowning He looks down
at the bills

his back Earl pulls out another packet then another
examining the bills

An older vacationing couple is eyeing Jeff warily

ripped caked with blood He ducks between two parked
cars using a side-view mirror as he hastily wipes blood

off his face He checks to be sure no one is watching

Something catches his eye

passing a row of pay phones He looks up stops dead

Red is talking on a pay phone six feet away

looks around panicked More cops are spreading out on
foot Theyll notice him any second

Jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow-moving
postal truck The truck speeds up nearly crushing him
under the rear wheel assembly

Jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels gets to
his feet on the other side and finds himself

in the path of another huge truck
A cop is standing only 20 feet away Jeff goes
underneath another trailer crawling between the moving

Suddenly his grip falters on the grease His back
scrapes the rushing asphalt Jeff gasps makes a grab

Several dozen COMMERCIAL VEHICLE license plates are
scattered about -- Arkansas Oregon Texas Iowa South

Red looks up from toting a box of car stereos and snarled
wiring as the moving van and Pontiac Firebird arrive at
the barn

He beckons for the vehicles to pull forward into

Jeff breathes in sharply presses his eye against the

INT BARN GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
Red unlatches a hidden compartment under the chassis of
the moving truck He and Billy slide out a long metal

box similar to a drawer in a morgue

They lift the metal lid revealing --

CANVAS SACK

open revealing Amy -- gagged with duct tape her wrists
and ankles taped She squirms and kicks wildly her
screams muffled

root cellar

visible in the knothole

Their gaze meets and holds

RED

returns and takes Amy by the legs Al and Billy lift her
by the arms As they carry her to the root cellar Red
peers into her terrified face

RED
Dont worry honey Its not as
bad as it sounds Itll take you
about 10 minutes to suck the air

Amy reacts writhing even more violently but shes no
match for the three men

BARN HAYLOFT

Jeff watches helplessly as

The men disappear with Amy into the cellar We hear a
METALLIC THUD then a few moments later the men reappear
without her Red closes the trap door secures it with a
heavy padlock then slides the panel of false flooring
over it

RED
Cmon lets go

They turn walk toward the door Red opens it Arleen

whisper

JEFF

JEFF
(louder)
Amy
Still no reply
Jeff swears glances around the dark room There is a
tool bench across the room
JEFF

Hang on baby Theyre in the
house I cant use the lights

He goes to the tool bench fumbling in the darkness He
knocks over a cardboard box -- a pile of car keys spill
across the table His hands run over an assortment of
tools He locates a hammer takes it

Returning to the trap door Jeff inserts the claw in the
padlock and tries to pry it open The lock wont give

He strains using all his strength Suddenly the handle

snaps Jeff flies backwards

JEFF
Fuck

He gets up goes to the tool bench His hands feel over
and reject an assortment of small tools He finds a
crowbar returns to the trap door and inserts it into the
shackle twisting with all his might After several
failed attempts he swears

JEFF

more noise theyll hear

Jeff mulls his options He sets his jaw exhales
JEFF

Please God let her still be
alive

climbs up into the cab and tries turning on the CB radio
but no luck -- the keys are gone

He opens the glove compartment There are maps trip
logs truck stop receipts He rifles through them

quickly

Jeff frowns gets on the floor of the cab and gropes
under the drivers seat His eyes register a discovery

He brings out a big black semi-automatic pistol

Jeff studies the base of the grip clearly unfamiliar
with guns He fumbles with the clip ejects it The
clip is full of bullets

He snaps the clip back in place

Amy and Jeff run for the Ford F100 utility truck -- an
aging blue-collar workhorse equipped with side-mounted
toolboxes and a lumber rack bearing a ladder

IN FORD

Jeff keys the ignition The ENGINE SPUTTERS Amy whips
around to see the Peterbilt bearing down from the side

Jeff turns the key The ENGINE CATCHES He throws the
Ford in gear and floors the gas

The Ford shoots out of the Peterbilts path

The FORD PEELS OUT of the driveway and joins the road
spewing exhaust Its an old vehicle that doesnt
maneuver well

Jeff mashes the gas pedal The ENGINE STRAINS
BACKFIRING Amy looks back sees the Peterbilt joining

The Ford is sandwiched between the Cadillac and Firebird

as they race down the highway with the Peterbilt in the
rear

JEFF
lets out a cry as they carom off the Cadillac Blood
flows in a trickle down his neck Amy sees it

panicking
AMY

Amy raises the rifle thrusts the barrel awkwardly out
the window and aims at Billy She FIRES wildly -- BANG

grins as the SHOT WHISTLES past harmlessly He reloads
the SHOTGUN snaps it shut and RETURNS FIRE -- BLAM
HIGHWAY

The BLAST hits the Fords side-mounted toolbox The door
flies open Tools scatter on the road

veers away swearing as hammers and chisels and power
tools hit the asphalt and bounce up into his path

The front end of the extension ladder comes free from the
lumber rack and hinges into his path SMASHING the
WINDSHIELD

Billy swears and jerks the wheel steering away He
glances up suddenly sees Jeff aiming the pistol

The PISTOL FIRES

Billy slams backward against the headrest hit in the
face Theres blood everywhere The car careens toward

Look out

Al jacks the trigger -- BLAM BLAM

ON PETERBILT

a STRAY BULLET SLICES the hydraulic brake line running to
the trailer The HOSE HISSES and whips through the air

IN PETERBILT

Red swears and lets the truck fall back swearing Up
ahead is a long curving downgrade He taps the brakes
There is a jolt as the trailer bumps the tractor

RED
Sonofabitch --
He realizes The trailers got no brakes
HIGHWAY

The Peterbilt descends the grade letting out a RAPID-
FIRE BLAT of BACKFIRES Its gaining speed bearing down
on the Ford

IN FORD
Amy turns in the seat terrified The truck looms
closer Jeff keeps the gas pedal on the floor

JEFF
Hang on

They are flying into a hairy curve

IN PETERBILT

Red struggles to stay in control Every time he applies
the brakes the unchecked trailer jars the cab forward

The Peterbilt races into the curve

Red has no choice He has to pump the brakes and risk
jackknifing or the truck will fly off the road
altogether

He hits the brakes

HIGHWAY

The huge TRUCK SCREECHES on the asphalt tires smoking
cab and trailer folding at right angles

Then unexpectedly the trailer disconnects from the cab

IN CADILLAC

Flanking the Peterbilt Al glances to the side and sees
the trailer come untethered from the cab

Now the trailer is an unguided missile weaving drunkenly
back and forth across the blacktop

Al tries to swerve away The trailer streaks toward him
Al SLAMS on the BRAKES screaming

HIGHWAY
The trailer piles into the Cadillac There is a huge
IMPACT as trailer and Cadillac are reduced to scrap

metal

And just as this is happening
PETERBILT

blasts into the rear of the Ford jarring it forward wit
a CRUNCH of METAL and taillights

JEFF

slams against the wheel Amy is thrown against the
dashboard The Ford is being propelled downhill by the
Peterbilt

HIGHWAY

The two vehicles are now locked together gaining speed
as they hurtle down the grade

JEFF

jams the pistol through the rear pass-through window and
FIRES at Red in the truck BULLETS PING off the grille

The GUN CLICKS empty

IN PETERBILT
Red hits the brakes but its no use The bumpers are
meshed The two vehicles plunge downhill skidding

sideways

Up ahead a concrete bridge spans a deep gorge

HIGHWAY

The Peterbilt and Ford fly onto the bridge The big
truck glances off a railing The vehicles suddenly come
unlocked

The FORD plows into the concrete railing with a CRASH
The PETERBILT creams it from behind and caroms away

SKIDDING the length of the bridge before SMACKING the
opposite railing

nh

INSIDE ROAD

Jeff grimaces In front of them the concrete railing
has broken away Debris falls 300 feet to the bottom of
the gorge The Fords right front tire hangs in the air

Jeff looks at Amy She looks wildly adrenalated eyes
wide

JEFF
You all right

Amy looks back at him She expels a long breath and
nods

Jeff forces his upper body through the drivers window
and looks over the Fords roof at the Peterbilt

JEFFS POV - PETERBILT

Its facing them 50 yards away on the bridge The
engine is dead STEAM HISSES from the crumpled radiator

One tire is shredded

There is blood on the broken windshield

BACK TO JEFF

sitting in the drivers window He squints toward the
truck searching for any sign of Red There is none

AMY (0S)
Jeff
JEFF
Yeah

Jeff drops back into the cab The dashboard is crushed
against Amys legs She tries to wriggle free

JEFF
What is it
AMY
(wriggling)

Its just I cant get out
JEFF
What do you mean

AMY
I mean I cant get out

Jeff blinks He climbs out of the Ford runs around to
Amys side and yanks the door It comes open with a
CREAK of METAL

Behind Jeff on the bridge a MOTOR KICKS OVER He
whirls

JEFFS POV - PETERBILT

EXHAUST BELCHES from the smokestacks Red is behind the
wheel His face is covered with blood He stares

hatefully

With a RASP of GEARS the Peterbilt lurches forward

BACK TO JEFF

He pushes against the dashboard with life-or-death
urgency

JEFF
Cmon Amy push

Amy struggles and struggles to free her legs

JEFF
Push goddammit

Amy glances toward the Peterbilt terrified

PETERBILT

creeps toward the Ford The trucks grille is smashed
One wheel RIM SCRAPES the asphalt It gains speed

IN FORD
Jeff crawls over Amy and tries pushing with his legs
She winces as the metal cuts into her skin Jeff
strains

AMY
(turning reacting)
Jeff

PETERBILT
rams the rear of the FORD -- CRASH It jars the pickup
farther through broken concrete guardrail
IN FORD
Jeff and Amy are thrown forward by the impact The
Peterbilts ENGINE ROARS Its pushing them over the
edge
IN PETERBILT
Reds eyes burn as he presses the accelerator and forces
the pickup farther through the broken railing
FORD
lurches through the widening gap in the railing
Concrete sails into the canyon The front tires hang
over the void

IN FORD

Jeff strains against the dashboard It wont give He
whips around swearing and leaps from the Ford

AMY
(panicked)
Jeff

ON BRIDGE

Jeff runs to the Peterbilt and jumps on the drivers side
running board grasping the door handle
Red heaves the door open suddenly It strikes Jeffs
head with a crack He falls backward to the ground

IN PETERBILT

Red presses the gas yelling over the ENGINE ROAR The
railing is giving way He sees Jeff struggling to his
feet

RED
You think you can come into my
life and fuck with me Nobody
fucks with me

He looks down Jeff is no longer visible Red frowns

Suddenly the passenger side door flies open and Jeff
surges into the cab landing on Red clawing at his eyes

They grapple in the cab Red swings an elbow into Jeffs
face -- crack Jeff drives a fist to his jaw

The steering wheel drifts counter-clockwise as the truck
inches forward ramming the Ford closer to the precipice

Red gets his hands around Jeffs neck as the steering

wheel continues to move counter-clockwise

ON BRIDGE

The truck is no longer hitting the Ford squarely

Instead the Peterbilts right front tire is riding up

and over the cargo bed crushing the left side of the

Ford under its massive weight

IN PETERBILT

Red has both hands around Jeffs windpipe He glances up

for a second reacts but its too late

ON BRIDGE
The Peterbilt is surging up the drivers side of the
Ford using the pickup like a ramp
IN FORD
Amy screams as the left side of the cab is flattened
under the Peterbilts weight
ON BRIDGE
For an instant the Peterbilts front tires seem to hang
in the air then the truck is falling
IN PETERBILT
Red and Jeff are thrown forward in the cab still
flailing at each other as the truck plunges nose-first
into the gorge
Then it jerks to a halt in mid-air

ON BRIDGE
The left rear set of wheels on the trailer is snagged on
the thick rebar reinforcement in the crumbled concrete
railing

The Peterbilt is dangling nose-down from the bridge

IN PETERBILT

Jeff slams into the windshield Red lands on top of him
Loose objects from the cab rain against the windshield

They grapple Red grabs Jeffs arm and twists sharply
forcing it at an impossible angle Their faces are
inches apart

RED
You think you can fuck with me

He headbutts Jeff viciously -- crack Blood erupts from
Jeffs nose and mouth Red is about to deliver another

blow when

the windshield falls away The loose items in the
cab plummet 300 feet to the canyon floor below

Jeff drops through the windshield opening He clings to
the center support column His legs dangle over the
hood

Red slips through the opening his hand locking on the
steering wheel at the last instant

The windshield sails away into the gorge

ON BRIDGE

The iron REBAR GROANS Its beginning to give way under
the weight of the truck The truck slips slightly

ON PETERBILT

Jeff feels the truck shifting He grabs the windshield
wiper blade with his free hand The blade snaps away

Red is clinging to the steering wheel He flails at Jeff
with his feet swearing Jeff is barely out of reach

Jeff looks to the side There is a grabhandle on the

corner of the cab He reaches with his free hand and
seizes the handle

ON BRIDGE
The REBAR GROANS The truck is wedged against the Ford
As the truck slips it forces the Ford closer to the
edge

ON PETERBILT

Jeff clings to the handle He reaches for the passenger
side door handle working his way up toward the bridge

REBAR

gives away once more and --

JEFF
scales the cab finding more handholds He climbs past
the passenger door

Behind him Red is working his way higher in the same
manner He grabs Jeffs foot trying to pull him off the
cab

Jeff kicks free and climbs past the sleeping compartment

Red grabs the door handle Jeff boots the door release
button

The passenger door flies open

Red falls away as the door opens Hes clinging to the
open passenger door suspended over the gorge

IN FORD

Amy breathes in sharply feeling the Ford move closer to
the edge She struggles to free her legs from the

dashboard

AMY
Oh God Jeff

JEFF

climbs higher The Peterbilt slips again Below Red
loses his grip and almost falls

Jeff hauls himself onto the bridge with a final gasp of
exertion He runs to the passenger side of the Ford

The Ford teeters precariously Any move could send it
over the edge Jeff can only extend his hand to Amy over
the void

JEFF
Cmon Amy its all you now
you can do it

With a huge effort Amy frees herself from the dashboard
and reaches for Jeffs outstretched hand just as --

PETERBILT

comes free from the rebar

AMY

takes hold of Jeffs hand

PETERBILT

plummets into the canyon

RED

screams

PETERBILT

seems to fall forever before landing with a huge
EXPLOSION

ON BRIDGE

Jeff and Amy fall backward on the road Down below
secondary EXPLOSIONS rock the canyon Jeff takes Amy in
his arms

AMY
Dont let me go Jeff

JEFF
I wont baby I wont ever let
you go
He looks into her eyes Their lips meet in a kiss and

we --
DISSOLVE TO

EXT REDS HOUSE - DAY
Police cars and official vehicles are parked outside the

house RADIOS CHATTER Yellow crime tape holds back
onlookers and news reporters
Cops and evidence technicians work the scene A
criminalist photographs stolen property as its carried
out of the barn

A plainclothes FBI AGENT closes a cellphone and walks
over to where Jeff and Amy are sitting at a picnic table
They are battered and bandaged

JEFF
Hows the sheriff

FBI AGENT
Out of surgery It looks like
hes gonna make it As for the
wife and kid shes not talking
hes being turned over to
Protective Services

Jeff nods soberly

FBI AGENT
Weve got ID on the dead
suspects Turns out they were all
licensed truckers One of em had
a rap for check kiting Otherwise
they couldve been model citizens

JEFF
What about the leader

FBI AGENT
Same thing His real names
Warren Claney Three speeding

tickets in five years -- apart
from that hes clean as a
whistle

Amy watches as cops stack windshields outside the barn

AMY
(dazed)
How could they do it How could
they treat it like a business
FBI AGENT

(shaking his head)
I dont know Ive been doing
this 15 years Ive never seen
anything like it
(MORE)

FBI AGENT (CONTD)
It was simple efficient and
organized They stayed on the
move spread it over a dozen
states As long as no witnesses
survived its an untraceable
crime

(looking at them)

You were just a couple of the
lucky ones

Up ahead a television news helicopter is landing on the
road A cameraman reporter and producer hurry over

Jeff watches the news crew a bemused expression It
seems like a million years ago

The FBI Agent shakes his head disdainful

FBI

(re media)
Cmon -- lets get you folks out
of here before things really get

hairy

He escorts them to a waiting sedan As they climb in
Jeff looks back over his shoulder surveying the scene
one last time

He gets in and the car pulls away just as the frenzied
news crew arrives mikes and cameras at the ready
running alongside the departing sedan shouting
questions

Through the rear window we see Jeff putting his arm
around Amy pulling her close as we hear

AMY
Promise me one thing

JEFF
Name it

AMY
Next time we fly
EXT HOUSE - AERIAL - DAY

Over this last line the sedan drives away and we CLIMB
HIGHER and HIGHER AWAY FROM the bristling crime scene
until the ranch house is just one in a town of modest
houses and the pink desert floor spreads out endlessly in
every direction
FADE OUT
THE END
