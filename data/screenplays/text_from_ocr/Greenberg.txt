board is a vintage wind-up toy girl playing vibes Greenberg
winds it and the girl rotates and plunks out a tune He pours a
pill into his palm from a container at his bedside and downs it

sound of her peeing He hesitates

her the grocery list with the two items She grabs Mahler’s
green leash from a hook Mahler jumps up excited

EXT BACK YARD - LATER 22

The swimmers are gone Greenberg in a T-shirt and shorts
walks cautiously around the edge of the pool Mahler runs
energetically in the grass He nudges Greenberg with a frisbee
Greenberg grunts a sound that approximates “Sit” The dog
doesn’t respond Greenberg wrestles the frisbee from the
animal’s mouth and tosses Mahler bolts after it

Greenberg removes his shirt and wades into the water He
shivers Suddenly he pushes out He can’t really swim -- he
keeps his head above water and dog paddles to the other end
Finally he reaches the ladder and lifts himself out He’s
panting

He lies down in a chaise and tries to relax

Greenberg grabs scissors from a left behind paper-doll project
on the table and idly snips at his hair while he talks

person now

GREENBERG
I saw him a few years ago

IVAN
Yeah but now he’s eight he’s like a
friend -- he’s fun to hang out with

Ivan gets into the turn lane and waits for the oncoming traffic
to pass

IVAN
I’m glad you’re here man It’s good
for me to get out like this

GREENBERG
You want to put your blinker on

Ivan does They make the turn and continue upward the street
narrowing Greenberg applies cherry chapstick to his lips
Ahead people are spilling into the street Kids run around
Balloons are tied to the outside railing

GREENBERG
Are you kidding meballoons
(pause)
Keep going keep going keep going

Ivan slowly drives past the house both of them craning their
necks to survey the party

GREENBERG
I hate how the men out here all dress
like children
(watching)
What a nightmare This kind of thing
makes me want to live in Europe

IVAN
I can maybe park over here

GREENBERG
No keep goingkeep going

Ivan continues winding upward He pulls into a drive-way and
turns around Greenberg yawns anxious almost giddy

GREENBERG
I feel like I have those glasses from
that John Carpenter movie and I can
see who these people really are

IVAN
That wasn’t bad that movie

GREENBERG
I thought it was terrible

They re-approach the group now from the other direction

IVAN

chance

IVAN
Youre kidding me

INT BELLER’S HOUSE - LATER 28

People mingle kids run around Ivan dumps his jacket on a
chair with a pile of coats knocking some onto the floor

GREENBERG
(under his breath)
Is this a fucking children’s party

Greenberg in his down vest drifts toward a wall of packed CD

shelves He looks irritated

IVAN
What’s wrong

GREENBERG
I justI find Beller’s CD collection
offensive He’syou can see all the
effort The amount of Brazilian
musicI mean I doubt he really
needs eight Os Mutantes CD’s

MEGAN (0S)
Hey manly men

IVAN GREENBERG
Hi Megan (trailing off)

At a certain point you’re just

showing off

at Greenberg and smiles slyly

They both nod

CUT TO Greenberg finds the bar area He suddenly comes face to
face with a scruffy guy 40 in a hooded sweatshirt This is
Eric Beller

GREENBERG
Hey Beller

Beller appears to make eye-contact with Greenberg but quickly
engages with another guy in a baseball cap Pep Boys T-shirt
and cargo shorts Johno Greenberg taps Beller’s shoulder

GREENBERG
Hey man how are you

BELLER
(dryly formal)
I’m good I didn’t know you were out
here

GREENBERG
I wasn’t
(in a funny voice)
“How is Lenny”

Beller hesitates confused
BELLER
(to Johno)
Duder it’s called Your Grandmas
Pussy -- it’s like Anaconda -- you get

seven cards down --

Greenberg nods trying to participate but neither guy addresses
him Greenberg applies his chapstick Finally

BELLER
That shit just makes your lips drier
GREENBERG
I know
Someone yells “Beth” Greenberg turns around Beth late
30’s holds a young girl in her arms and the hand of a boy ina
Devil costume at her side She’s greeted by Beller’s wife
Greenberg stares
BELLER

She and Steven are getting a divorce

JOHNO
They were a cool couple

BELLER
(looks at Greenberg)
Come to think of it he’s kind of a
less Jewish looking version of you

GREENBERG
Less I’m not evenI’m only half

BELLER
But you’re doing this

Beller holds his hands about a foot apart and shakes them
imitating Greenberg’s previous gesture Johno laughs

GREENBERG
What’sI’m thinking smallI’m
(trying to figure out what
he did)
Is this a Jewish gesture

Beller shrugs Johno laughs
GREENBERG
(to Johno)
Beller always with the self-hatred
JOHNO

You kidding have you been to one of
Eric’s Seders Eric gave trees to

Israel
BELLER
Am I not allowed to make a joke about
it
GREENBERG
No I know I’m just saying since you
said “less Jewish looking” Because

people think I look Italian And
since my mom was Protestant I’m
actually not Jewish at all

They stare at him Greenberg excuses himself and walks through
the crowd over to Beth At the last moment she sees him coming

BETH
Oh my God hey

GREENBERG
Hey Beth

He leans over and kisses her cheek

BETH
How are you

GREENBERG
Oh I’m fair to middling You know
Leonard Maltin would give me two and a
half stars

BETH
I haven’t seen you since --

GREENBERG BETH
In his movie guide -- probably like ten years ago
in New York

GREENBERG
I think it was at Matt Levy’s wedding
actually It seems like such a long
time ago Or maybe it doesn’t maybe
it feels kind of recently

BETH
It’s both

Greenberg wipes his damp brow with the sleeve of his wool
jacket

BETH
You’re sweating

GREENBERG
Yeah

suicides and thethe weird sudden
shortness of breath check into the
hospital dead in an hour ones

(pause)

GREENBERG

GREENBERG
(trying out his line)
All the men out here dress like
children and the kids dress like
superheroes

BETH
What are you doing these days You’re
in New York right You’re making
music

GREENBERG
I haven’t played music in years I’m
a carpenter you know for money but
now I’m really trying to do nothing
for a while

BETH

Greenberg hesitates Megan passes by

MEGAN
You owe me a white wine spritzer

BETH

He wipes the sweat off his face with his sleeve again

BETH
Youre sure you’re not hot

GREENBERG
I’m fine But I wish I could be one
of those guys who doesn’t care where
he dumps his coat at a party
She laughs and backs away

Florence searches the room turning things over Greenberg
looks at her books on shelves held up with bricks Ed McBain
and Lawrence Block-type mysteries interspersed with psychology
film and literature maybe saved from college They’re both
still in their coats

FLORENCE
(seeing him with her
books )
I don’t read enough I’m such a bad
reader

A framed photo of Florence around ten wearing a T-shirt that
says Yo-Yo A blonde man in a polo shirt has his arm around
her -- she looks scared and uncomfortable

GREENBERG
Is that you

FLORENCE
Yeahit’s one of the rare times I
was actually happy around my dad

Greenberg nods He moves over to the refrigerator A colorful
abstract drawing held up with a La Brea Tar Pits magnet

GREENBERG
Did you do this

FLORENCE
No that’s my niece

GREENBERG
I have a niece Two and a step one

FLORENCE
I know I work for their parents
Of course

GREENBERG
Right

(re the picture)

It’s good

FLORENCE

She’s four
(pause)

I want to

have a relationship with

her but she’s just not that friendly
to me You want to see I got her
these puppets for her birthday --

She retrieves two puppets -- a witch and devil -- from a drawer

FLORENCE

They might be too old for her They
have sticks

GREENBERG

I’m sure theyll be fine What do you
have to drink

FLORENCE

Oh Um okay You don’t want to go

to a bar

GREENBERG

It’s Friday -- the bars are probably
full of bridge and tunnel peopleor
whatever the LA version of bridge and

tunnel is

She walks across the

room her foot catches a boot in the middle

of the rug She stumbles

Sorry

She opens the fridge

FLORENCE

FLORENCE

I don’t really havethere’s a Corona
Light and I have some cheap tequila
someone left here once

GREENBERG

Shall we split the Corona

Okay

FLORENCE

She opens it and hands it to him He takes a swig and passes it
back to her She drinks Hiccups

FLORENCE
I always get hiccups when I first
drink carbonation

GREENBERG
Don’t worry about it

She offers the beer back to him

His mouth is on hers Their arms groping He pulls her blouse
over her head

FLORENCE
I’m wearing kind of an ugly bra

He nods and tries to undo it

FLORENCE
There’s no clasp

GREENBERG
(frustrated)
It’s like an ace bandage

He lifts it -- her breasts heave toward him The bra awkwardly
stuck at her collar bone

He leads her down on the bed and yanks down her jeans pulls
aside her underwear and shoves his face between her legs Her
eyes search the room uncomfortably

FLORENCE
Do you hear a train Is that a train

She sits up stiffly He stands goes over to the kitchenette
and pours himself a tequila

FLORENCE
I get kind of nerdy

She pulls her bra back down over her breasts

GREENBERG
Don’t worry about it

FLORENCE
Can we take it slow I’m sorry it’s
just I just got out of a long
relationship and
(pause)
(MORE )

FLORENCE (CONTD)
I don’t want to go from just having
sex to just having sex to just having

sex
GREENBERG
Uh huh Who is the third “just having
sex”
FLORENCE

You If we had sex

GREENBERG
Okay Then who’s the second one

FLORENCE
A guy I met at this gallery thing

GREENBERG
You slept with him

FLORENCE
YeahI did

Greenberg looks annoyed

GREENBERG
How did that go

FLORENCE
What do you mean The sex

GREENBERG
Yeah well

FLORENCE
It was pretty awkward

She gets off the bed pulls up her pants and walks toward him
They stand about a foot apart He takes her hands The nails
and cuticles are chewed

She undoes his pants and sinks down to her knees

FLORENCE
(suddenly)
Oh there’s my purse

He looks at her head at his crotch He holds onto the counter
for stability and comes immediately She withdraws brusquely
and stands up

Greenberg shivers still finishing He registers something on
her face

GREENBERG
What’s that on your lip
FLORENCE
What
(she touches her mouth)
Nothing
GREENBERG
It’s not
FLORENCE
No it’s not a cold sore
GREENBERG
You sure
FLORENCE

Yeah I picked it

GREENBERG
Mm Where’s your bathroom

INT BATHROOM 34

He flushes the toilet with his foot and washes his hands He
inspects a black head in the mirror but thinks better of
squeezing it He notices a scale on the floor

He steps on the scale He frowns He braces himself on the
sink and pushes off his shoes He gets back on the scale
Still a look of displeasure He steps off quickly

INT LIVING ROOMBEDROOM 35

Greenberg exits the bathroom Florence wears a bulky white robe
and smokes a cigarette She listens to a message on her
machine A girl’s voice She holds the receiver

FLORENCE
Ugh this is so annoying but I really
have to call my friend Gina back
Sorry it’s just if I don’t call her
right away Ill be a bad friend
She’s always got an emergency I’m
sure it’s nothing

GREENBERG
How far do you think it would be to
walk

FLORENCE
To your brother’s place Way too
long It’s like five miles You can
stay

GREENBERG
I have the dogand

FLORENCE
I can drive you
(re the phone)
This will only take a second

GREENBERG
You have to call her right this moment
-- won’t she understand you’re in the
middle of --

Florence slowly puts down the phone hesitates

FLORENCE
No I can take you now

GREENBERG
I don’t want to make you do that
You’ve got your robe --

FLORENCE
It’s not a problem

GREENBERG
I can probably call a cab

FLORENCE
Okay

She grabs a flyer from a stack on her desk

FLORENCE
Ohthis is stupid but I’m singing
Saturday night at this place on Orange
and Sunset

She hands it to him -- it’s a drawing of a bird and a guitar
Greenberg debates something in his head

FLORENCE
I meanif you feel like it I know
it’s last minute

She grabs it back and writes a 6 over the 4 on the address

FLORENCE
Gina made the flyers and she copied
the address down wrong

GREENBERG
I don’t think What time

FLORENCE
Like at 1130 It’sthere are a lot
of acts so it’s hard to pinpoint
Don’t feel obligated

GREENBERG
(pause)
We probably shouldn’t do this again
I mean you work for my brother

FLORENCE
Yeah --

GREENBERG
And I’m really trying to do nothing
right now

FLORENCE
That’s cool And I’ve got to stop
doing things just cause they feel
good

approaches the animal slowly Mahler’s breaths are labored

bar with a series of folding chairs and tables facing a badly
painted black riser and a cheap glittery back-drop The place
is about a quarter full

A lanky bearded guy with glasses plays acoustic guitar on a
stool and Florence stands and sings at the microphone
Greenberg slides into the bar at the back and orders a beer

FLORENCE
“Theres a rugged road on the prairie
Stretchin all across the last
frontier There a stranger strives
solitary Blessed is the lonesome
pioneer”

Florence’s voice is sultry low and unstudied Greenberg
watches Florence sing Gina a short haired girl in a striped T-
shirt appears next to Greenberg She orders from the bartender
who’s distracted texting someone

GINA

sexy and hot up there

Greenberg nods uncomfortable

GREENBERG
Uh huh I grew up here I drove

he’s feeling -- he looks completely thrown

bottle then runs it across the counter

GREENBERG

FLORENCE
Under the sink In that last song I
kept the singer male

He opens the cabinet below the sink and tosses the paper towel
in a plastic bag tied to a hook

Florence goes over to the refrigerator and opens it She takes
out a red Jello mold with floating fruit

FLORENCE

market

his mouth and waits He coughs and tries again Suddenly water
spurts out and he quickly dodges the stream

That’s right I’11 call you this

People at another table erupt into loud laughter One guy
guffaws and claps Greenberg glances over at them irritated
Ivan laughs

GREENBERG
Laughing already demonstrates
appreciation the applause seems
superfluous

GREENBERG
Also it’s like just treat the
restaurant like it’s your living room
guy
(pause)
I’m weirdly on tonight

IVAN
Should we order

GREENBERG
I was reading an article in the paper
this morning about someone running for
office and they gave his age as 41 and
my first thought was that guy’s an
adult Adults run for office

IVAN
Right

GREENBERG
But what I’m not thinking is “I’m 41
too” If I was in the paper that
would be my age

IVAN
I know it’s like when I look at my
highschool yearbook now the seniors
still look so old

GREENBERG
Maybe I should’ve invited Florence
Or I shouldve had a partyI don’t
know

IVAN
Birthday’s are hard

GREENBERG
It’s weird aging right It’s like
“What the fuck is going on”

IVAN
I know It’s like that Eddie Money
song

The guy at the table stretches out his legs

GREENBERG
I mean you know it’s happening
We’re all playing by the same rules
and stillsomewhere in the back of
my head I thought I’d never actually
be forty Let aloneover forty

IVAN
It’s heavy forty

GREENBERG
It’s a chunky word

IVAN
Youth is wasted on the young

GREENBERG

I’d go further I’d go life is wasted
onpeople

(sighs)
Should I invite her It doesn’t have
to mean anything I don’t want to set
up a series of expectations with her
What do you think

IVAN
(shrugs)

Yeah if you want
GREENBERG

I guess I could call her
IVAN

Then we should wait to order
GREENBERG

Maybe it would be good Do you care

IVAN GREENBERG
NoI mean It’s a different dynamic

IVAN

Right
GREENBERG

She lives near here I’11 see if
she’s around She probably has other
plans I won’t get into it being my
birthday

(an afterthought)
She’s young

Greenberg gets up and heads outside We STAY with Ivan alone
in his thoughts He watches different women at the bar He
hums to himself The bus boy refills his water

IVAN
Thanks
He tops off Roger’s water
IVAN
Thanks

The bus boy picks up Roger’s napkin from the floor and puts it
back onto the table

IVAN
Thanks

He overhears a girl 13 talking to her father at the table to
his right

GIRL
I have a total love affair with
Hawaii

Ivan takes a sip of Roger’s scotch He takes out his cell phoné
and checks -- no messages A level of self-consciousness
surfaces as he surveys the restaurant

GREENBERG (0S)
I don’t find a lot of girls in LA
attractive do you

Greenberg slides back into his seat

IVAN
I do Yeah
GREENBERG
I said I don’t
IVAN
Oh I do
GREENBERG
She isn’t as pretty as Beth -- or her

face is but she’s rounder Not fat
I find it sexy Butyou’ll see

IVAN
I never found Beth as beautiful as
everyone else did
Greenberg hesitates thrown for a brief moment

GREENBERG
She was my girlfriend

IVAN
Years ago I didn’t think you’d take
offense

GREENBERG
Well you like racist Portuguese
women

IVAN

She made one remark And it’s really
cultural I mean by our standards
Fabula’s mother is a bigot

(pause)
I know you never liked Fabula

GREENBERG
Florence is If you worked in an
office with her you’d definitely
develop a crush on her But outside
of the office you’d start to wonder if
she’s as cute as you imagined

IVAN
Youre describing my experience of
life

Ivan looks at the table cloth

GREENBERG
She’s young But I said that already

IVAN
I’m just saying Fabula’s a lot less
possessive than she used to be
Youd like her more now --

Greenberg flags a guy in a white smock

GREENBERG
Can I get another scotch

IVAN
That’s the bus boy

GREENBERG
Fine can I get another fork this one
has some food on it

The bus boy takes the utensil Greenberg looks at Ivan -- he
relents

GREENBERG
Fabula never got you She thought
shed bagged some fancy British man
rather than just Ivan I know she
helped with the addiction and
everything but You’re over that
We have to find you someone It’s too
bad neither of us are the type to go
whoreing

IVAN
Is that her

Greenberg startles and turns around Florence hurries toward
their table smiling She wears a heavy cardigan denim skirt
and sneakers Greenberg half-stands

GREENBERG
This is Ivan

Nice to meet you You too

She kisses Greenberg’s cheek and sits next to Ivan in the

Farmers Market and hosts a running
charades game every Friday night and
swing dances I like to keep a low
profile He knows that too And this
was a big thing for me involving both
of you together Im happier
compartmentalizing everything It just
works better

Florence laughs

rather the devil you can switch it
out

The devil puppet sits on her bureau

GREENBERG
No I’m happy with the witch Thanks

Greenberg tries to manipulate the sticks

GREENBERG
Youre right these are too old for
your niece

Florence opens a bag of crackers and pops one in her mouth

FLORENCE
I’m impressed by you

GREENBERG
In what way

FLORENCE
I don’t knowI was telling my
friend Gina how cool it is thatI
mean you seem really fine doing
nothing It’s like you don’t feel all
that bullshit pressure to be
successfulI mean by other people’s
standards

Greenberg’s face turns red

GREENBERG
I’m You know I almost had a record
deal when I got out of college I
haven’t done nothing

FLORENCE
Cool

GREENBERG
I want to be doing what I’m doing
I’m doing nothing deliberately

GREENBERG
Yeah I guess so I lost Ivan for a
few years there to this racist he met
in rehab But their marriage is
ending which is good for him And me
to be honest

FLORENCE
Oh Good

GREENBERG
You probably wouldn’t believe this
but in college we all looked up to
him He was from England and he used
to be really handsome and stylish and
kind of great

FLORENCE
I can believe that

GREENBERG
I used to borrow his pants You know
when you’re younger you wonder how do
people become who they are Who are
those beaten ex-junkie out of work
guitar players who end up fixing your
computer And then you realize
they’re Ivan Sad

FLORENCE
(mumbles )
Who are those personal assistants who
sing at open mike nights

GREENBERG

mean I wish I had felt more young
when I was your age I’m probably
young now and don’t know it

Florence nods

Greenberg

Greenberg

GREENBERG
Ivan and I call each other “man” but
it’s meant as a joke because it’s the
kind of thing we wouldn’t call each
other It’s our imitation of other
people

FLORENCE
I know what that’s like This friend
of mine Marnie and me we went to
this cheesy bar in Hollywood one night
and we just thought let’s pretend
were kind of slutty girls looking to
get picked up Even though we
weren’t And we ended up talking to
these two frat guys but like 30 who
were all into their bodies and
cologned very well groomed And we
ended up going back to one of their
places -- and I think one of the them
was almost retarded or he was really
drunk because he didn’t make any
sense And they got out a video
camera and Marnie and I did this kind
of strip teaseit was crazy because
we were still playing these girls but
here we were showing our breasts
and

looks stricken She stops

FLORENCE
We ran out of there pretty fast We
were total freaks

seething gets up and goes to her computer

FLORENCE
What are you looking at

GREENBERG

I’m going to see if I can find the
video of you

FLORENCE
It’s not on the internet And it
wouldn’t be under my name if he posted
it which I’m sure he didn’t

Florence watches as Greenberg types

skater who comes up a lot --

Frustrated Greenberg marches over to the refrigerator and opens
it

GREENBERG
You never have anything good to drink

He goes into a cupboard and pours himself cheap tequila She
comes up behind and puts her arms around his waist He pushes
her off

GREENBERG
(furious )
That’s like the stupidest story I’ve
ever heard Are you sure you didn’t
fuck these guys

FLORENCE

missed by five percent I’m not

did

cup on a hydrant while he takes off his down vest and sweater
exposing a damp T-shirt He throws the clothes over his arm

and sits on the front lawn of a house We MOVE IN on his face --
he drinks the hot coffee as the sun streams down Sweat spills
down his temples Greenberg dials his phone and wedges it
between his cheek and shoulder

into his fur

little balls of peanut butter She brings them to Mahler who
eats them from her hand The phone rings

I hate how it makes me feel But when

Anita looks at him alarmed

GREENBERG
Drop it Drop It

He pulls the pizza from Mahler’s jaw tearing it in half
Mahler gulps the rest of it down

SARA (0S)
It was crazy his mom was dying and he
didn’t come to visit

Greenberg stops in his tracks and listens to Sara who speaks to
Muriel

SARA (0S)
I don’t know I guess he couldn’t
deal

GREENBERG

(to no one in particular)
She told me not to bother she was
going to be okay

A bunch of the kids surround the water Greenberg approaches
The sound of the wind-up girl playing the vibes

A dark animal floats in the middle of the pool One eye is
visible bobbing above the water Greenberg edges closer

RICH
What is it
GREENBERG
It’s a
JERRY

I think it’s a bird or an opossum

SARA
I think we had one of these once
before

Greenberg squints tries to make out the creature The single
eye of the dead animal stares back Muriel grabs him suddenly
and fakes throwing him in Greenberg jolts

GREENBERG
Holy shit don’t

The kids laugh Rich takes a pool net on a pole and starts to
fish the animal out A guy Zach hands Greenberg a joint

ZACH
I’m sorry your dog has AIDS

GREENBERG
He doesn’t have AIDS It’s an
autoimmune disorder

People squeal as Rich swings the animal toward everyone He
turns the net over and dumps the soggy creature on the grass
People gather around it

Greenberg tokes on the joint and spies his dog-house in a corner
of the yard Two kids sit on it making out Discarded cups and
glasses lie atop the loose pine boards

He rubs his cherry chapstick across his lips A car door slams

Greenberg walks to the fence Ivan approaches from the street

GREENBERG
Oh god man Don’t give in I know

to stay free but that’s what
adulthood is I mean I could just

but I don’t want easy

IVAN
Youve been dating Florence for a
month I’ve been married for ten years

GREENBERG

(sighs)

It’s been a really hard time for me
Roger I mean I miss my family

Greenberg massages his own shoulder with his fingers

GREENBERG
It’s not going away It’s
transforming You’re going through
something Which meansyou’1ll get
somewhere

IVAN
I don’t think you understand what it’s
been like for me out here How
myhow the kind of life I had hoped
for It is huge to finally embrace
the life you never planned on

Ivan wipes a tear from his chin Greenberg is at a loss

IVAN
I wanted to make that record

GREENBERG
We never would have survived at a
major label with those restrictions --

IVAN
How the fuck do you know

GREENBERG
Because that’s not how the world
works

IVAN
What could you possibly know about how
the world works You’ve never
entered the world

GREENBERG

(hesitates)
Listen man I think you’re playing
out some old family dynamic here
Apropos of what we were saying before
about what people say about us --
people feel you hold onto petty
resentments and --

IVAN
You asked me what people say about
you I don’t want to know

GREENBERG
No you should know People think you
play the victim I don’t mean this in
a bad way but you let people feel
sorry for you when it just protects
your narcissism --

IVAN
I don’t want to know

GREENBERG
Well that’s why I didn’t want to be
in a band with you Because you won’t
acknowledge any of your shit You
were fucked up all the time and --
What do you want me to say I didn’t
know it was going to be our only
offer I didn’t know I had the power
to blow it I thought we were all
just giving our two cents I didn’t
know the band would fall apart because
of me I just thought “Fuck ‘em”
Maybe obviously I’d do it differently
now

Greenberg is suddenly crying in sloppy jagged sobs

GREENBERG
Of course I know what it’s like to
live a life I didn’t plan on What do
you think I’m doing right now

He sputters and sobs Ivan takes a deep breath

IVAN
You know the people I hang out with
we say “Oh I’1l lend you that
graphic novel” we mean it We do it
You don’t know how to do that

Ivan starts to walk away then comes back

IVAN
This is a small thing and I know it’s
probably boring for you but you know
it would’ve been nice if you’d made an
effort to know Vic

GREENBERG
Who’s Vic

IVAN
My son

GREENBERG

Oh Victor I didn’t recognize the
diminutive

YELLOW REVISED 42809 114

IVAN
Florence told me you were in a
hospital You know I understand that
kind of stuff We could have talked
about it Maybe made each other feel
better And instead we don’t talk
about anything good

GREENBERG
She knew Who else knows

Ivan shakes his head and walks away
INT SARA’S BATHROOM - LATER

Music booms through the floorboards He’s on the phone

GREENBERG
Florence I don’t know if you peed yet
or you’re going to get this message
tonight but I gave Mahler two of his
pills but then he ate pizza and one
he’s supposed to take on an empty
stomach and -- I don’t know what to
do I know so little about basic
shit I can’t even swim in the pool
My brother’s in Vietnam and I can’t
swim in the fucking pool We have the
same parents I can’t blame that
There was something else I wanted to
tell you You know I’m sorry I can
bewhatever it is I can be It’s
half my fault and half the atmosphere
That’s a Leonard Cohen lyric You
should cover that song You sing
great You should go on YouTube and
all that stuff you guys do Just do
it You go girl I can’t believe
they closed Tower Records How did
that happen What was it I wanted to
say --

(a knock on the door)

Occupied I don’t understand what
happened to meYou remember Charlie
Sheen standing on his balcony in Wall
Street saying “who am I” Did you see
that movie Philip and I used to make
so much fun of it I’m thinking now it
wasn’t so stupid I like you

I’m never going to be one of those
people who remembers people’s
birthdays or gives a shit about their
friends’ kids I mean you and Ivan
seem to get pleasure from that shit
I could never get pleasure from that
Oh this is a good song Someone once
said to me “Hurt people hurt people”

me

Was that that was you like a few
days ago I used to have a good memory

His face glistens with sweat

GREENBERG

She coughs -- it’s ragged and guttural

MURIEL

He presses his face into her soft big bosom and closes his
eyes

GREENBERG

okay
The faraway sound of an alarm
INT DEN - MORNING 93A
Greenberg opens his eyes The phone is ringing White sharp
light fills the room He climbs off the couch He makes a face
-- his body stiff and in knots Greenberg massages his temples

Muriel’s bags are gone

It’s morning

Greenberg in underwear and an old Steve Winwood “Back in the

Mahler hops up and approaches Greenberg

MURIEL

How are you feeling Sunny

GREENBERG

They laugh Muriel’s turning into a hacking cough

SARA
We decided that’s our name for you

Greenberg grins he likes that He scoops out a cigarette butt

from Mahler’s drinking water Out the window Marlon and Peggy

arrive at the pool A gardener drags a brown garbage can in the
grass

GREENBERG
I think I’m still drunk

The New York Times is spread out on the table Greenberg grabs
the A section He flips to the back His eyes search He
grins He tosses the paper down between the girls

GREENBERG
They printed my letter about Iran

They both smile politely

SARA
Cool

GREENBERG
“Roger Greenberg Hollywood
California”

For a moment Greenberg is glowing He arranges Mahler’s pills
on the counter The girls chat animatedly at the table

SARA
I mean I’ve got no problem with just
giving some guy a blow job but she
takes it to the extreme

Greenberg listens to the girls’ conversation He opens the
fridge and takes out the butter

MURIEL SARA
Why do guys like to do that -- (laughs )

He collects the butter pads and crouches down Mahler eats from
his hand

SARA
Youre really good with him You have
dogs

GREENBERG

No Florence showed me how to do it

SARA
(grinning)

(looks to Peggy)
Uhyeah I guess

PEGGY

Mahler runs to Peggy Greenberg hesitates a moment seeing the
dog eagerly rubbing against her legs A sadness passes over
him

GREENBERG
Um wait a second

Greenberg removes his Steve Winwood concert jersey and hands it
to Marlon

GREENBERG

You know put it by his nose
MARLON

No problem
GREENBERG

Great I’11 write this out for you

grass Beer bottles on its roof

MARLON

GREENBERG

EXT GREENBERG HOUSE 95

Greenberg in his sweater and down vest hurries out lugging
his duffel The girls wait in their rental car The engine
running

SARA

MURIEL SARA

Greenberg reaches the vehicle breathing heavily

MURIEL SARA
I love that you’re doing this (to Muriel)

Byron Bay

Greenberg opens the back door and hits his knee

GREENBERG
Ow fuck

He exhales in frustration and pain Pause

Greenberg jumps in
INT RENTAL CAR - DAY 96

Sara drives Muriel shotgun Greenberg sits in the back a
giddy look on his face Music plays on the radio

Greenberg massages his temples

GREENBERG

MURIEL
You can go look at whales while we
dive

SARA

Sunny will look at whales

GREENBERG
Okay you can cut out the “Sunny”
business

The car stops at a light Sun streams into Greenberg’s face
He squints and tries to move out of the way of the beam He
reaches into his pocket and fishes around He frowns
irritated

GREENBERG
Shit I left my chapstick

Greenberg looks outside A blue wind-sock in the shape of a man
billows outside a car dealership

A look of discomfort crosses his face -- the hang-over settling
in His skin glistens damp and pale He considers something
He says quietly to himself

GREENBERG
“Dear Florence”

He takes a deep breath of anxiety His hand grips the door
handle

GREENBERG
You know what --

He pulls the handle but the door is locked A helicopter
passes overhead The roar vibrates the car The music is loud

the girls oblivious Sara is checking out something on Muriel’s
arm

SARA
That’s so weird

Greenberg takes deep hoarse breaths
GREENBERG
I’ve gotI’m supposed to get someone
from the hospital --

The car starts to move

GREENBERG
Hoho Hold it

Sara laughs

GREENBERG
Open my door

SARA
No you’re our prisoner

MURIEL
Exactly

GREENBERG

Open it Open the fucking door
The girls are laughing

GREENBERG
Come on open it

The car brakes Sara presses the automatic lock just as he
pulls the handle It’s still locked He yanks it again
96A

GREENBERG SARA
Sara I’m trying Stop pulling it

She releases the lock He yanks the handle and shoves it open

MURIEL
Oh come on Roger

He climbs out dragging his duffel
GREENBERG
You know I can’t go I

(pause)

The car pulls into traffic

SARAMURIEL

EXT STREET - DAY 96A
He’s left outside the car dealership The blue man dancing
Greenberg sweats Cars roar past Using his sleeve as a
buffer he presses the button for the cross-walk He pushes it
a couple of times

We HOLD on Greenbergs face The helicopter circles back
overhead The pavement shakes Greenberg takes deep hoarse
breaths -- his panic escalating with each intake

INT HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - DAY 97

A sleepy Florence scribbles her signature on a form Greenberg
sticky and pale stands next to her -- his duffel leaning
against his legs He points to another sheet of paper

GREENBERG
I think you have to do that one too

EXT FLORENCE’S BUILDING - LATER 98
Greenberg helps Florence out of the taxi

INT FLORENCE’S APARTMENT - LATER 99
Greenberg lowers Florence into the bed

FLORENCE
Thanks

She’s still a little groggy from the drugs

FLORENCE
I’ve got to get insurance The
anaesthesia was so expensive I’m such
a baby about pain I stayed over
night I’m glad your brother’s coming
back next week I need to work more
hours

She runs her fingers over her dry lips

FLORENCE
I really picked my lips in my sleep
(sleepily feels a scab)
This was possibly about finding a pet
in the canyons

GREENBERG
Do you get the New York Times

Florence shakes her head
GREENBERG

It’s good to get the paper I’11 pick
you up one

FLORENCE
Okay
GREENBERG
Diddid you get my message
FLORENCE
I haven’t checked yet What did you
say
GREENBERG

UmI reassessed the movie Wall
Street among other things

FLORENCE
I don’t know it

Greenberg’s attention goes to a gift wrapped in a Marie Claire
cover on the desk

FLORENCE
I wasn’t going to give it to you
because I was pissed but you can open
it Happy Birthday again

GREENBERG
Thanks

Greenberg tears open the present

FLORENCE
Hey thanks for picking me up

GREENBERG
It’s no problem

It’s the devil puppet
FLORENCE

Now you have the set Not that
they’re a set

GREENBERG
What about your niece

FLORENCE
Remember the sticks are too old
She’s coming over this weekend -- I

framed her picture

Her niece’s drawing is now framed and propped up on the floor

GREENBERG
You have a tape measure
FLORENCE
I think there’s a ruler in the desk

drawer

Greenberg opens the drawer and finds a foot ruler with each inch
representing a different animal He turns it and they dissolve
into dinosaurs He grabs a pencil

GREENBERG
You want it on this wall here

FLORENCE
Okay

Greenberg measures in one foot intervals on the wall He makes
small marks with the pencil

He stands on a chair leans one foot on her desk and bangs a
nail into the wall He crouches down lifts up the picture and
hangs it on the nail

FLORENCE
Cool Like a professional

He steps down from the desk

GREENBERG
I am a professional Well I build
things

Florence smiles sleepily

GREENBERG
I know you know I was in a hospital
I’m not hiding it But it’s not what
defines me you know

FLORENCE
I understand
(pause)
I want to listen to my message
She dials her voice-mail Greenberg watches her

GREENBERG
I’dI’d had some to drink

She listens

FLORENCE
Gina
They wait
FLORENCE
My mom
Silence
FLORENCE

Okay This is you

She listens We hear echoes of Greenberg’s ramblings
Greenberg tries not to watch but can’t help peaking back at
her Their eyes meet briefly before they both glance away
Florence stares at the floor Greenberg at the wall

Someone leans on a car horn in the street Florence laughs at
something her eyes now finding Greenberg and holding He
brushes away dust from a corner of the desk

We STAY on Florence’s face

Black
