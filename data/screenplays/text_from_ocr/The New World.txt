Pocahontas easily prevailed with her
father and her countrymen to allow her to
indulge her passion for the captain by
often visiting the fort and always
accompanying her visits with a fresh
supply of provisions therefore it may
justly be said that the success of our
first settlement in America was chiefly
owing to the love this girl had conceived
for Capt Smith and consequently in this
instance as well as in many others

LEGEND - EXT SEA
A legand appears over the wild unbounded sea

“No man understandeth or knowes
what Virginia is”
- Capt John Smith

The legend fades out excapt for the word “Virginia”
beneath which appears the date

26 April 1607
Then continues

WHILE COLUMBUS HAD STRUCK THE SHORES OF
THE NEW WORLD OVER A CENTURY BEFORE
NORTH AMERICA REMAINED UNEXPLORED

EXT NEW WORLD SHORES CHESAPEAKE BAY

Young Pamunkey Indians the original inhabitants of the
Virginia coast splash and duck each other in the shallows
‘of Cheasapeake Bay

Little work is required of them Virginia is a rich
magical country where nature has provided for every human
want Wild plums and cherries grow in profusion along the
banks of the musical rivers Grapes dangle from the boughs
of tall pines and bog magnolias perfume the air The
braves tend the fishing weirs plant corn and squash while
the women gather berries and lay meat out in strips to dry
Their work is soon finished however and they join the
children at their life of play

UNDERWATER SHOT - POCAHONTAS - ANGLES ON SHORE

Gayest of them all is POCAHONTAS a girl of sixteen whom
we first discover underwater diving for mussels and
catching a sturgeon by the tail She trims her hair with
pearls as sha sits by the shore She gazes in a rapture at
the wind rushing through the trees
C-

The Indians all defer to her She is the favorite
da daughter
of POWHATAN their Emperor who sits along the shore in a
mood of philosophical delight She has a love of life and
Snanega mischievous way that makes her irresistible to
em all

EXCITED scouT

A scout suddenly breaks into tha Indians’ midst gesturing
towards the east with breathlesa excitement

EXT VIRGINIA SHORE

The Indians rush through the pine woods and down to the
shore where they stop and gape Three English merchant
ships loom on the horizon

What are these apparitions Birds Floating islands
Messengers of the gods At a signal from their leader
they hurry back to their camps

TIGHT ON POCAHONTAS

The Indians run past Pocahontas and into tha woods
Messengers beat drums and blow sea-shell trumpets

Puzzled she drifts down toward tha shore She stands in
tha woven shade at the water’s edga gazing at the English
sails She is in no way alarmed It is as though she knew
they were coming A mysterious smile appears on her lips

EXT CHESAPEAKE BAY - ABOARD THE SUSAN CONSTANT
A sounding line plunges into the dark waters of the bay

VOICES (0S)
Tan fathom Sweeper bearing right
Cap’n Right full rudder

Aboard the eight-gun Susan Constant flagship of the three-
vessel fleat CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER NEWPORT breathes in the
first sweet fragrance of the land They have spant three
months at sea wracked by tempest and disease Not one of
the seventy men on board is entirely fit Still most have
managed to drag themselves on deck where they gaze in
prayer and silence at the heart-stirring green band on the
horizon

Unlike the Puritans who will follow them thirteen years
later they are a reugh quarrelsome lot of desperadces --
the refuse of society Amarica-bound because England would
not have them -In this new land they have everything to
gain and nothing to lose

Newport their leader is a gentleman of fame With

2 ¢ D
he raided Cadiz harbor in 1587 and single-handedly captored
the Madra da Dios the richest Spanish galleon ever to fall
into English hands

INT HOLD - CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH

one young adventurer CAPTAIN JOHN SMITH is not on deck
but sitsin the hold He has been cast in irona to await
hanging on a charge of mutiny

Smith is a boisterous man of great strength a warm-hearted
rebel a lover of play and song He speaks his mind
without mincing words convinced he must always be right
in small matters no less than in large He is long
accustomed to the disfavor of his superiors and dees not
have a politic bone in his body

He wears the earring of a Moorish woman to whom he was once
a slave He has been a prisoner of the Turks a beggar in
Moscow has fought the Tartars in Transylvania and been
shipwrecked in three seas With no rank or property no
education or connections he can only win fame or fortune
by his daring The career he has taken up is the single
one open to a parson of his ambition

He is a true pioneer forever laaving the past behind
bearing the brunt of danger contemptuous of fear -- a
conqueror who lets down anchor when the whim seizes him
makes the shore his home for a while then inevitably grows
bored and moves on to seek his luck elsewhere

EXT ENGLISH SHIPS - FLAGS

The Susan Constant signals her two sister vessels to come
about and fall in behind her They are tiny things decked
with flags and painted with bright markings as a defense
against sea monsters They look as though they had been
built for children hardly seaworthy

EXT JAMES RIVER

The ships leave the sparkling waters of Chesapeake Bay and
turn up the James River in search of a harbor beyond the
reach of Spanish privateers A man dangles over the side
to taste the water

MAN
Sweet water Captain

EXT JAMESTOWN MOORAGE

The English moor the ships to the long branches of an oak
tree that hangs out over the banks

With Newport in the lead they wade ashore The speak

Hera on this strip of marshy land America is born
Jamestown will be Englands first permanent sattlement in

the Northern Hemisphere for that matter her first colony

OTHER ANGLES

The English explora the land enjoying their new freadoms
after months on the Atlantic They pick the plants and
inspect them amazed by the bounty of this new world
Everything is splendid and rare

VOICES (0S8)
There’s oysters on tha shore as thick
as stones Fish everywhere They
look into your eyes Well live like
kings Kings

They feint at one another with their swords practice
parries and thrusts chop at branches and flowers to test
the edge of their steel stab vainly at the fish that flash
through the streams There are a few women in their
company two or three

SAILOR
Captain Newport

The sailor calls Newport’s attention to a dugout canoe
floating down the river Insida the canoe fully arect
sits a skeleton draped with pearl necklaces

NEWPORT
Muskets

Newport pricks his ears as a strange haunting song comes
wafting to him on the wind from far away The men are keen
with apprehension and excitement Far away Pocahontas
watches from her perch in a tree

EXT HANGING TREE -

Elsewhere unaware of this apparition CAPTAIN WINGFIELD
prepares the noose in which as a first order of business
Smith must hang Smith stands on a stool unperturbed

SMITH
I admire you Wingfield Yes Tf
admira anybody who dares to anjoy
himself Aftar all most things are
set up so you won’t

(MORE )
SMITH
They hold you by the nose and make
damn sur you wont misbehave Well
God will take care of them right

WINGFIELD
If I were you Smith I would take
advantage of these precious minutes to
compose my prayers

SMITH
He has no intention of hanging me
Why should he He follows the path of
logic Wingfield He uses his mind

WINGFIELD
I think in this fateful instance you
might be wrong

SMITH

I don’t know why I waste my breath
Let people be Don’t open their eyes
Supposing you did what’d they sea
Their misery Man is a brute -- a
great brute If you are cruel to him
he respects and fears you If you ara
kind to him he plucks out your eya

WINGFIELD
Good very good I intend to make a
collection of your sayings if you
will permit me

Capt Newport walks up

Newport has only wanted te throw a scare into him as Smith
The men raise a cheer as Smith’s hands are

guessed
untied

NEWPORT
Lat him go

WINGFIELD
You said to hang him

NEWPORT
Remember Smith that you are under a
cloud and that it will darken if I
hear any more of your mutinous
remarks Now make yourself useful

He is an immensely popular figure

WINGFIELD
I think you should reconsider this
decision sir
Te

NEWPORT
Wingfield not everybody in this world
is able to keep hig mouth shut and
you might perhaps ba ons of those who
can’t Thay find they have crossed
the subtle line between independance
of thought and sheer insolence Now
that might be happening te you don’t
you think

Smith gives Wingfield a broad smile

EXT VIRGINIA SHORE

Smith swaggers around ignoring his shipmates’
congratulations He has a hardy confidence in himself that
inspires respect His eyes are alive with a cunning
intelligence He wears a bright uniform and a steel
chestplate embossed with a rampant dragon despite the heat
that has caused the others to strip down to their singlets
There is something convincing about his bold outlandish
manner He has a way of carrying it off

BEN the ship’s cook salutes his friend

BEN
They lat you go A terrible mistake
they made there Come sit lixe a
gentleman he idla I thought surely
they would hang you

SMITH
Why would they do that

BEN
Why for the ‘arm you done us ali 1
can only speak for myself but before
I mat you I knew nothing and now I
am if a man should speak truly
little better than one of the wicked
lying about the whole day dreaming of
gilded palaces and the like caring
nothing fer the world’s business You
could corrupt a saint Capt Smith

Smith smiles He likes hig mates and the place he enjoys
in their hearts

BEN
Lend me a pinch of tobacco would you
No Not a pinch I have friends’ and
I have acquaintances I will piss in
your bedding

(MORE)

BEN (contd)
I will see dog’s meat made of your
flesh and dice of your bones Work on
that
(to the others)
You see gentlemen there is no
defense against wit

SMITH
Pity you haven’t found a way to live
by it
He walks off
BEN

Hold your tongue As I am a gentleman
born I will gat drunk grow valiant
and beat you within an inch of your
life

Smith stands with a man named ACKLEY gazing at the woods

ACKLEY
There’s something out there Smith
You can feel it I don’t like it that
the trees run down so closa to tha
shore The boats not protected

NEWPORT AND SCOUTS
A scout has sighted the Indians
scout
Naturals sir See there They was

making quite a fuss too

Three Indians run down the opposite shore of the river
calling to one another in strange bird-like syllables

NEWPORT
Prepare the pinnace and a war party
Twenty men
The three Indians run past Pocahontag
EXT VIRGINIA WOODS - SMITH

Smith enters the virgin forest awed but unafraid like

someone entering a graat cathedral He has slipped away
from the others

The trees are full of cool drafts like a spring-fed pool
They seem to roll on forever flat and park-like
partitioned by creeks and streams that at low tide become
slicks of black mud Clusters of grapes hang from vines
that twine through their boughs
rut

Softwoods grow side by side with oaks and popl
contradictory sight to European eyes Turkeys dust
themselves in the sand Their nests lie opan brimming
with eggs As though they had no fear of marauders The

ca of aac ird stands out sharp and clear

this April afternoon P Fhe calm of

POCAHONTAS AND PARAHUNT

Pocahontas and her brother PARAHUNT steal through the
trees to get a closer look at the visitors

Pocahontas wears a wreath on her head and a short buckskin
apron Except for the long strands of pearls and shells
that hang around her neck she is bare above the waist
Below her knees and above her elbows her arms and legs are
ornamented with tattoos giving her a vaguely Polynesian
appearance

She sees Smith and freezes in her tracks Parahunt wants
to go back but impatient with her brothers timidity ‘she
ventures closer
Smith turns and sees her all at once Sha gazes at him as
though he were a visitor from the sky With his beard and
his glinting armor alone in the stillness of the forast

he seams so handsome so unafraid -- a blue-eyed fair-
haired god She turns a cartwheel Then with an odd
laugh she is gone

EXT OPPOSITE SHORE OF THE JAMES

The pinnace a small sailboat strikes the opposite shore
Newport and his men jump out and weighted down with their
casques and armor crossbows and pikes wade clumsily
ashore Quickly they find footprints at first only
footprints Tangion mounts as they advance into the woods
They sanse they are being watched

SATLOR
Sssssst

Newport looks around to behold a magnificent Pamunkey brave
standing at the adge of a clearing a hundred feat away

The brave lowers his bow and gives two loud shouts The
English jump back startled

Newport steps forward and puts his hand over his heart as
a sign the English mean no harm The brave nods as though
to say he understands He raises his hand and two hundred
battle-dressed warriors step out from the woods

They are a handsome people a full head taller than the
English

Unlike the savere aquiline Indians of the

whom we are accustomed they have round faces broad e
cheekbones and straight noses Their skin is the color of
burnished gold their eyes jet black in shape almost
Chinese Buffalo tails dangle from their belts on the
ground behind them Dead blackbirds hang from their ears
They chalk their cheeks and arms with root dyes and shave
the right side of their heads to keep their hair clear of
their bowstrings giving each man two completely different
profiles -- one frightful the other soft and noble The
English have never seen beings remotely like these and
murmur with astonishment -- astonishment then gradually
fear as they realize thay could easily be overwhelmed

The brave strikes his head and chest then reaches out to
strike Newport’s the same way Newport shies back
distrusting his intentions The brave smiles and repeats
the gesture

NEWPORT
Mr Ackley

The brave pulls his hair than with a jovial look points at
Newport’s own

ACKLEY
He does not know how to make his °
meaning plain but it appears he means
wa are all made of the same flesh and
blood

Again Newport puts his hand over his heart The brave
comes forward nodding with great satisfaction and asks
permission to touch Newport’s skin The Indians are
fascinated above all else by the Englishmen’s white pallor
exaggerated by their long months at sea Newport laughs
and holds his arm out for inspection The brave touches it
with a little gasp of awe Pocahontas looks at her brother
and smiles

EXT ALONG THE JAMES RIVER - A GOLDEN AGE

The Indians have grown more trusting They dance with
panpipes on the shore and wade out into the shallows to
greet the English longboats with songs of welcome Some
paddle ahead in their long canoes to warn Newport’s
helmsman of snags in the water

“We have never in the world so far encountered a kinder
people” wrote James Barlowe captain of Raleighs ill-
fated 1584 expadition “We were entertained with
friendship and were given everything they could provide
We found (them) gentle loving and faithful lacking all
guile and trickery It was as if they lived in a golden
age of their own”

A sailor rushes up to Smith breathless with excitement

SAILOR co
I gave this Indian woman a brokan
plata and she give me four rows of
her pearls I tell you we come to
the richest country in the world

The ship’s BOSUN a great hulking man spots one of the
Indians stealing a hatchet

BOSUN
What do you think you’re doing

The Indian backs away uncomprehending His people have
communal ideas about property which the English do not
share

BOSUN
Drop it

Alarmed by the bosun’s tone of voice the brave turns and
runs The bosun levels his musket and sends a volley
crashing through the underbrush stinging the fleeing
Indian’s shoulder with a spray of pellets His fellows
gape at this display of the Englishmen’s power Smith
knocks him to the ground ’

SMITH
You fool Tie his hands behind his
back

The bosun strikes back at Smith who with a swift display
of physical courage quickly subdues him The Indians
retreat to the trae line Pocahontas watches as Smith
tries to call them back but’ they no longer trust the
visitors from heaven

BOSUN
He stole my hatchet

Smith drags tha bosun down into the water and in full

sight of the Indians shoves his head underwater again and

again as though to show them he will punish the offender
They do not understand the meaning of this display
howavar and shying off like deer they disappear into the
woods Pocahontas is tha last to retreat her eyes still
detained by the English hero

NEW ANGLE

Newport harangues the assembled English company

o

NEWPORT
Capt Smith did wall today and went a
considerable way towards reinstating
himself in our good opinion But the
hardships we face are greater still
for the actions of a fool Tonight wa
shall sleep aboard the ships every
man in full armor In the morning we
shall chop down every tree within half
a mile of the moorage and use the
straightest timbers to palisade a
fort When we have done that wa must
sat corn put up houses and lay in
firewood Slackers will be executed
at the site of their transgression
Yas Salway

SELWAY
Sir when are we going out to -- poke
around

NEWPORT

Wea are not here to pillage and raid
but to expand England’s domain of
reason and light We have it in our
means to make a fresh world here one
where the lion might lie down with the
lamb and the wolf with the sheep
where there might be plenty for all
Every man who works hard in time will
be rawarded But we must work too
for the good of thosa who are to come
We shall enjoy the good things of the
earth and wa shall be happy to think
that after us and thanks to us men
will racognize themsalves as being
happier bettar and more free

SELWAY
Begging your pardon but if wed
wanted to farm we could ‘ave stayed
in Devon

NEWPORT
Perhaps youve made a terrible
mistake Gold will do you no good six
months from now when the snows fly
We want to live in peace with these
people Our survival depends upon
keeping that peace We shall at some
point explora the land but we shall
not plunder it Do I make myself
clear

When nobody speaks Newport lowars his head and offers a
prayer of thanksgiving

NEWPORT
Lord we have the Devil and all the
Gates of Hell against us but if Thou
art with us we care not who is
against us Grant us therefore a
healthy portion of Thy mercies We
ask it in the name of Thy son Jesus
Christ our Lord Amen

EXT JAMESTOWN SETTLEMENT - MONTAGE

At dawn the next morning the English strip off their
doublets and set to work The forest rings with the bite
ef their Kentish axes Sweat glistens on their tattooed
backs After months at sea the work is a joy

When the felling gang is done the sawyers drag the logs
off to hew them into timbers Soon a small fort is under
construction

Pocahontas watches from afar From time to time she allows
the cabin boys to approach her They soon are teaching her
English words

Foragers attempt to catch fish and wildfowl but without the
help of the Indians have little success Carpenters put
together a shallop a shallow-draught vessel for navigating
the rivers pitch the tents and stake out gardens Yeomen
sow oats and barley

Newport is a wise leader He gives every man a job though
the gentlemen are exempt from physical labor He goes
around keeping up their spirits and where necassary
lending a hand But when he comes upon two of their
company plucking a wild goose he is inflamed to wrath

The men are hauled to the ground and their hands are bound
behind thair backs

NEWPORT
Clever dogs Staunch to the last
Never told us how they managed to look
so fit And why should they No
fine fellows fine fellows

(turning to his adjutants)

Wait until the sun goes down to bury
them I don’t want the Savages to
think our numbers are dwindling

INDIANS’ POV

Overcome by curiosity the Indians have raturned to the
vicinity of the camp From acreéss the river they witness
the execution of the poachers It seems not to deter their
curiosity A brave named TOMOCOMO talks with the sentries
a distinctive man dyed black from head to toe and covered
with tattoos

EXT HALF-FINISHED FORT AT JAMESTOWN - SMITH

Smith sits with a sketch board drawing the strange
variaties of plants he has turned up Thea fort is now half-
finished At one point standing watch by the wall he

sees Pocahontas cavorting with the cabin boys -- walking on
her hands challenging them to follow her axample in tha
English phrases they have taught her He notes how

finding herself alone she looks up into the clouds above
Her lips move as though she were speaking with someone

She seems to feel his ayes on her stops turns and looks
avenly at him He waves to her She waves back as though--
urging him to come out and play He smiles and shakes his
head he is on guard and must stay where he is But the
incident makes its impression His nerves tingle with a
strange delight Will he go away into the blackness of
death never having known the mystery of her free fresh
life ‘

EXT COMPANY STORE

Ben shows Newport that the kegs of grain and hardtack they
have brought from England are infested with worms

NEWPORT
Tha damp got in

BEN

-- The damp’s not your preblem Some of
the kegs was good but they’re gone
now Somebody filched ‘em I know
what youre thinking but it couldn’t
have been the Naturals They couldn’t
get through the lock Had to be one
of our own

ACKLEY
The frost hag nipped our oats We set
them in too late The natives know

how to’ catch these fish They wont
come to a hook

14

NEWPORT
Speak softly Tell no ona of the
condition of our storas

EXT HALF-FINISHED FORT - SMITH’S POVS

Smith watches the cabin boys imitate their Indian playmate
Her cinnamon breasts have inflamed their young
imaginations Then he sees that an English party under the
leadership of CAPT ARGALL an adventurer like himself has
captured two Indians who ventured too closely to the fort
and brought them to Newport for interrogation One of them
is Tomocomo

ARGALL
They can tell us what we can’t find
out for ourselves

INT SAILCLOTH LEAN-TO

A council of the Jamestown elders sits in the shade of a
slung sail Hogs forage for scraps of food in the rutted
lanes The captured Indians stand next to Newport

NEWPORT

(presiding)
We are here by the will of Providence
Had we not sighted land the day we
did I would have turned back We’ve
eaten the best part of our stores
Our best men are sick with fever the
rest will soon breathe mutiny We
might as well be shipwrecked Now the
Naturals tell me of a city up the
river and a mighty King who lives
there I propose we sand an envoy to
him to sea whether he can be
persuaded to trade with us
Meanwhile I shall raturn to England
for fresh supplies I will not be
back until the spring You will be
utterly alone until then but my
leaving will free the men when
adversity strikes of any temptation
to return Ratcliffe here will be in
command As to who shall approach the
Savage King I needn’t tell you that
it will be a hazardous mission

A silence follows
ARGALL
Captain Smith is the only professional
soldier among us He alone is suited
to the task

There are noises of agreement Smith bows

WINGFIELD
leaping up)

I should very dearly like to know one
thing What is to prevent this friend
ef the hangman from making league with
the Naturals then turning upon us
only under the extremity of torture I
should like to assume Or instructing
them in the conduct of war and English
strategies if I may make so bold

His right to the title of Captaincy is
dubious at best The laow-born son of
a yeoman cannot be expected to behave
with a gentleman’s sanse of propriety

ARGALL
Perhaps you’d like to go Wingfield

The others laugh

NEWPORT

The sentiment of the council is clear
Moreover it conforms with my own

(to Smith)
This will be your opportunity to
repair your reputation for discipline
and obedience I expect you to
welcome it

SMITH
(with a bow)
I do

27 EXT JAMESTOWN DOCK

Smith walks along the Jamestown dock with Newport as he
prepares to set off in the shallop the carpenters have
built Meanwhile the principal ships are being provisioned
for Newports return to England

NEWPORT
Are you afraid

SMITH
No

Newport smiles through all this
seems almost paternal

NEWPORT
I would be

SMITH
I’ve always believed that sooner or
later something good something
special was in store for me A
destiny all my own I suppose I ama
Musselman in that way

NEWPORT
A Musselman

SMITH

I begged in Moscow when it was blowing
snow in eight-foot drifts I was the
only man to come out alive when my
regiment was overrun by the Turks in
Transylvania They put a chain around
my neck and gave me as a slave toa
Stambuli lady -- her name was
Tragabonza -- and she ordered me
around like her sit-up dog until she
got bored and poisoned me to see if I
could take it I never lost hope
Even when it looked bad you know I
never even felt in danger I had this
feeling through it all that there
was something waiting for me -- my
life would not end until I had found
it -- achieved it I never knew where
it lay or what it was exactly

(over a river winding

its way into the interior)
Ruling hug countries for myself and
the King doing things that seem
impossible to the world making the
heathen fly like the wind -- I had all
manner of ideas Then I came to the
conviction it was in the East I
thought that must be it -- to find the
way through to the Indies No one has
dona it I mean to and I will

NEWPORT
Interasting You must always keep in
mind your responsibilities to the rest
of your countrymen however Most of
them are idiots and fortune-seekers
but even so they are under your
protection

(MORE)

with an indulgence that

‘ NEWPORT (cont’ d)
You have the makings of a leader
Smith You have a future here So
the boat is ready Make Englands
name formidable ‘

Smith bows and boards the shallop They have laid on
provisions of cloth beads food and books The rest of
Jamestown waves goodbye from the shore

EXT CHICKAHOMINY RIVER - SMITH’S POVS

Smith makes his way up the Chickahominy River in search of
the King With him are nine Englishmen heavily armed and
the two captured Indians They sing as they row toe steady
their nerves

The river winds through vast floating gardens of water
lilies and sedges The shores thrum with cicadas Little
by little the land reveals itself to them

They pass an Indian town The people come down from their
fields to raise up their peculiar shouts of greeting but
they no longer offer help or gifts

At night they see braves spearing eels in the shallows by
the light of flaming torches

The land grows still more mysterious more magical as they
work their way up the river Dragonflies dart about like
pixies Huge carvings of otherworldly beings appear in the
rocks along the bank The skeletons of ancient Pamunkey
chiefs hang from the rafters of sacred huts It seems the
scenes of visionary enchantment will never end Yet
gradually the channel narrows The everhanging branches of
the trees make the going difficult and strange cries reach
their ears The English company scon is showing distinct
signs of unrest

HE LMSMAN

Captain we haven’t the draught to go
any further

(Smith is silent)
I can’t stand out in the river They
can reach us with their weapons now
You hear me Captain We’re in
bowshot

Smith signals that they should put in to shore

EXT SHORE

Two Indian women tempt a sailor who has wandered off from
the rest of the English party to follow them into the

woods He is cautious at first but curiosity or lust gets
the better of him

30 REST OF THE PARTY
His distant cries of pain send shivers through the English

FIRST ENGLISHMAN
Let’s go back sir

SECOND ENGLISHMAN
We could gather a larger party Were
lost You know it and we know it
too

THIRD ENGLISHMAN
Let’s put it to a vote I’d rather
die on the gallows than have my throat
cut by these monsters

Smith feels a mutiny brewing

SMITH
The Naturals say that we shall come to
wide lakes and a mighty river falling
west into the Indian Ocean I thought
I shouldn’t tell you The people
there are unlike any we have ever
seen Gold is more plentiful with
them than copper is with us and for
as much red copper as you can bring
youll have three times its weight in
gold Why their chamber pots and
dripping pans are pure gold and the
chains they chain their streets up
with and even the prisoners they
take are bound in gold and as for
rubies and diamonds they go forth on
holidays and gather them by the
seashore to hang on their children’s
coats and stick in their caps

He continues over scenes of the original America the
infinite land of primeval beauty over its lakes and
mountains and streams

SMITH (0S)
I don’t know whether to credit this
You decide But I think we shall live
freely there without sergeants or
‘lawyers or courtiers only a few
industrious Scots perhaps who indeed
are scattered over the face of the
whole earth I think they will lay
their treasures at our feet You will
be noblemen never slaves

(MORE

He points west toward the Indies

forward

SMITH (cont’d)
Each man shall have his fig trea to
lie baneath They will favor you
without your having to pander scrape
er steal The things we value to tham
are worth no more than straw Thera’s
danger but what is danger compared
with seeing those cities - magical
capitals that stretch for miles and
risa into the clouds glancing in the
evening light Would the like aver
happen to you in England Your
freedom’s at hand men Make your
choice Go back and muck about the
rest of your lives -- dia like cattle
never lifting your eyes from the
ground -- or come with me -- to the
East

Only two men step

a young carpenter named THOMAS EMERY anda sailor
JEHU ROBINSON

EMERY
Look

One of the Indian guides Tomocomo has taken to the woods

SMITH
Lat him go I could have the rest of
you hanged as deserters But I’d
rather go on with these two men than
with a flock of ducks

EXT SHORE - FOG

Smith continues on with a canoe

the two English volunteers

ROBINSON
Very good Captain

SMITH
Was I impressive

The wildernass closes around them

SMITH’S POVS - FOG

The country has a supernatural mystery
their tails and slip beneath the surface

ducks pass overhead Were the canoe to capsize
probably drown under the weight of their armor

attack they would be defenseless

being drawn on he does not know quite why

the remaining guide and

Beavers crack
Flights of wild

they would
Against an

But Smith feels himself

Somewhere dimly he feels there is something waiting for
him something fine and unspeakable infinitely more
exalted than the prospect of fame and fortune that draws
the other English on

EMERY
You know where we area Captain

Smith does not reply

ROBINSON
What are we doin’ this for

EMERY
I’m after the coin Newport can talk
but I laid my Jesus on the shelf for
the time bein’ Instead I brought a
compass and a rule to make a map
Now tell me I don’t look a’ead and use
me brains

They jump out of their skins as Smith dischargas his musket
into a bush along the shore The shot echoes down the
Waterway until it fades away and the birds resume their
twittering

SMITH
Put in here

EMERY
But it’s thick as a jungle sir We
don’t know the trails

ROBINSON
It’s a bleedin’ evil place even in
daylight You don’t know what might
‘appen in there it’s that rotten
still

Ignoring their protests Smith straps on his siege helmet
33 EXT CHICKAHOMINY SHORE - SECOND LANDING
Robingon and Emery’ load their matchlocks
SMITH

Keep your matchlocks lit Signal if
you see anything

EMERY
What if they start peltin’ us with
arrows
SMITH

Imagine they won’t hit you

Smith moves down the trail into the wilderness accompanied
by the remaining Indian guide Soon his friends have
vanished from sight

SMITH’S POVS - BEAR ETC

He sees a hummingbird He sees a bear feeding on a
blueberry bush It watches him for a moment then moves
off

While he is thus absorbed his guide desarts him Smith
sees him retreating through the woods but does not pursue
him The music builds a mood of tension He is utterly
lost and he knows it

Mockingbirds fly down to attack him when he comes too near
their nest He presses on entranced Now in the
distance he hears a cry

POVS ON SMITH

Suspecting his mates have run into the Indians Smith turns
back The clanking of his armor is loud in the stillness
of the forest his bright silks conspicuous Gradually we
begin to observe him from the point of view of Pamunkey
warriors stealing up from the depths of the forest

EXT DEEP FOREST

From out of nowhere a flight of arrows descends on him
Two ricochet off his breastplate One plunges into his
thigh He plucks it out inspects it curiously and breaks
it in half He slips down the face mask of his burgonet
and prepares his halberd a spear with the head of an axe
A hundred Indians appear from the trees They do not come
at him directly but run around him in circles In their
manner of warfare the object is not to kill the enemy so
much as to humiliate him into surrender a display of
superior force demonstrating that resistance is futile

As they get closer the Indians race in and touch him like
children playing tag Smith shoots the boldest of them in
the hand with his pistol The others step back amazed at
this device that fires thunderbolts and lightning

Holding the entire party at bay he walks backward to the
point on the riverbank where he left his comrades

EXT BOG
Distracted Smith stumbles into a bog and quickly sinks up

to his waist His thrashing about only causes him to sink
deeper into the mire

N

The Indians close in His hopes of escapa gone Smith puts
the blade of the halberd to his chest as though he were
preparing to take his life He soon thinks batter of this
course of action however -- life is too sweet -- and
offers his weapon to the leader of the Indian party with
great flourish as though he were surrendering a whole
army He does not beg for mercy He does not expect it
Two braves drag him out of the bog

OPECHANCANOUGH steps forward a-chief seven feet tall so
stately in his manner that Smith at first takes him for a
fool He reaches out touches Smith’s beard and explodes
in laughter

Another Indian removes Smith’s shoulder bag smells it
then throws it away in disgust The English strike these
people as incredibly dirty and foulsmelling

Suddenly to Opechancanough’s great surprise his prisoner
leaps to his feet and taking a small box from his pocket
presents it to the chief with a deep bow Opechancanough
is wary of the mechanism at first but upon inspecting it
more closely he discovers inside an iron needle which
points the same direction whichever way you turn the box

When he tries to touch the needle his finger is stopped by
the glass further cause for astonishment The Indians are
unacquainted with this legacy of the Phoenicians

He turns the box upside down and looks at it from
underneath taking care to preserve an air of dignity in
the presence of his soldiers

SMITH
Would you mind fetching my musket from
the canoe

Opechancanough wonders at his effrontery He has never met
aman like this He orders the prisoner’s hands tied
behind his back

The Indians conduct Smith through the woods with his arms
lashed to a pole

EXT CITY OF WEROWOCOMOCO
Smith rounds a bend in the trail and stops in his tracks

astonished Before him rises Werowocomoco the seat of the
Powhatan Empire

The magical city stands on a bluff above the swirling mists
of the Pamunkey River hundreds of tree-bark houses of
every shape and description surrounded by a palisade of
immense logs Beyond the town lie well-cultivated fields
of beans and corn tobacco and squash

The inhabitants are a far cry from the savages the English
imagined they had found Smith is delighted

INT POWHATAN’S PAVILION

Smith is led into a longhouse and made to sit down The
house is covered with rush mats laid over an arched
framework of bent saplings The sides are trellised with
vines like a pergola and laid over with strips of bark
that can be rolled up on nice days to let in the sun and
the breeze

Now a host of warriors suddenly appears around him dancing
and singing frenzied songs They are incomparably more
majestic than the Indians he saw at the landing fach has
a quiver of arrows and a club Over their arms they wear
fox and otter skins Their heads and shoulders are painted
red and smeared with bear oil to make them glisten Now
and then they stop and look at their bewildered prisoner as
though he were a monster

Chiefs and Great Ones from the far-flung corners of the
Empire approach to inspect the prisoner the first white
man they have ever seen

Then all at once they fall silent
THE GREAT POWHATAN

In the roaring torchlight at the far end of the pavilion
appears a dignified man of sixty the GREAT POWHATAN ruler
of Virginia His robe is made of raccoon skins and painted
in incomparable colors Chains of pearl hang about his
neck is head is crowned with brilliant feathers and
tresses of moss

To his left and right sit the ranks of his councillors his
wives and court officials their heads and shoulders
painted red and pounced with polka dots of gold-flecked
sand At his side two young hermaphrodites wave fans to
make a breeze Yet the ruler’s majesty lies less in his
attire than in the gravity and omniscience of his manner

It seems to Smith that he has stepped out of his everyday
world and fallen in with a race of fawns satyrs --
mythical people

A messenger prostrates himself before the Emperor From a
satchel he produces the hearts and heads hands and feet of
Smiths late comrades Emery and Rebinson The Indian
Great Ones examine them with curiosity then turn to look
at Smith Smith shows no emotion though it appears the
same fate now awaits him

GREAT ONE
They are mortal

The natives speak Algonquin subtitles translate their
words here and in the future Tomocomo tha guide who
escaped at the river acts as Powhatan’s interpreter
Pocahontas looks on

INTERPRETER (TOMOCOMO)
Where have you come from

He points up to the sky inquiringly

SMITH
The sky No From England -- a land
to the east

INTERPRETER (TOMOCOMO)
Why have you come here

- SMITH

Exploring I hope you don’t consider
it a crime for a man to labor in his
vocation We had an encounter with
the Spaniards our enemy and were
overpowered put to retreat then by
extreme weather forced to this shore
The boats had leaks so Captain
Newport my father as you might say
left for England to get them repaired
and pick up supplies

INTERPRETER (TOMOCOMO)
When do you leave

SMITH
Leave I intend to push on I can’t
speak for the others There won’t be
any leaving before the spring The
ships won’t be back till then

They have set a great repast of bread and venison in front
of Smith food enough for twenty men Music enters And
now we start jump-cutting from the interpreter to Powhatan
himself until we establish the conceit that Powhatan is
communicating with Smith and even with the ether members
of his tribe in English directly
SMITH
You aren’t trying to fatten ma up are
you That would be a poxey trick

INTERPRETER (TOMOCOMO)
Why have you come up the river if you
stopped only to send the ships back
for supplies

SMITH
Because it pleased ma to My official
mission however is to pay my
respects and to trade for food and
other comforts I should also be
interested to speak with you about the
back sea over the mountains on the
other side of the main where JI hear
there is saltwater

INTERPRETER (TOMOCOMO)
Why should we help you

SMITH
directly to Powhatan)
Don’t you love your neighbors

POWHATAN
Some Others - how can you love
them They steal from you before your
very eyes They have no shame They
would gladiy burn this slight roof
above my head and kill me and my
children if they had the courage
But they are cowards and fear to
approach me even to come into these
woods You would laugh to hear what
they are afraid of A child would
laugh to hear it

(laughter)

Why should we help you

SMITH
We have articles that might interest
you Powers you do not possess

unless I am mistaken Things we might
teach you

With a coal from the fire Smith ignites a pile of
gunpowder The Indians stare at him like country people --
this man is a true magician Powhatan leaps to his feet

POWHATAN
My inferior in years and judgment
presuming to instruct me

(MORE )
ee

POWHATAN (cont d)
Manacle his feat Give him sea water
to drink Feed him withered roots and
acorn husks

Smith snatches up his sword His captors have left it
lying carelessly nearby as though they imagined it were a
decorative part of his costume Pocahontas looks on
overcome with awe

POWHATAN
Put that away You look ridiculous
I could disarm you with this stick

He advances confidently on the Englishman They stand
facing one another for a long moment Then with inhuman
speed Powhatan raps him on the wrist and Smith’s sword
goes flying from his hand

A brave stands up and levels his bow at Smith’s armor
hanging from the ceiling The arrow shoots clear through
the steel Suddenly a host of conjurers and medicine men
enters the court They dance around Smith with strange
gestures and fall to the ground in paroxysms of delight

The Chief Priest looks deep into Smith’s eyes and lets out
a piercing wail His body is covered with coal and oil

He wears a coronet of feathers and weasel skins Six
virgins arrange circles of cornmeal grain and sticks
around Smith’s figure Great wooden idols look down at him
with a scowl

WOBBLEHEAD a lunatic with the habit of rolling his head
gestures to Smith that his story has failed to convince
anyone - he will die Other natives reach out and touch
his face in sympathy

POCAHONTAS - SMITH’S POVS

Smith sees Pocahontas He wonders why she is here Her
hair is woven with strands of moss her mouth painted azure
blue She is the vary image of earthly beauty

At a signal from the Chief Priest the longhouse falls
silent Powhatan offers a prayer to his divinities then
throws his scepter in the dust at Smith’s feet The
audience gasps Without a moment’s hesitation his
attendants bring in two large stones and set them down in
front of the Emperor’ s throne

A dozen braves grab Smith drag him to the stones and lay
his head acrossthem Smith sees the end has come The
braves raise their huge clubs over his head The tips are
studded with bear fangs and flints

Suddenly Pocahontas breaks out of the crowd by her
father’s side runs to Smith and puts her hand on his head

The audience is astonished Sha winds her arms around
Smith’s shoulders She pressas har head close to his Her
hair streams across his face

POWHATAN
Come here

Pocahontas kneels in front of her father

POWHATAN
How can you stand up for this
creature

POCAHONTAS
What has he done to you He’s gentle
He’s not afraid

POWHATAN
Silence One more word and I will
chide you You’ve only seen your own
people This man is common as clay

POCAHONTAS
I must be humble in my tastes then

POWHATAN
Hush What do you know A child

POCAHONTAS
(whispering now)
Let me have him

POWHATAN
Why

POCAHONTAS
Because I ask it of you

POWHATAN
They know you are my favorite child
Would you embarrass me

POCAHONTAS
If I have to He might be a spirit
POWHATAN
A spirit
POCAHONTAS
Tell me -- have you ever seen his

like
POWHATAN
He eats and sleaps as we do He came
from the same place as the others

POCAHONTAS
Why do you speak this way father
Does pity never move you Look at
him A good and noble man

Powhatan smiles She is a stubborn willful girl but her
defiance only endears her to him She is his favorite
Child Except for Smith everyone in the longhouse knows
it Opechancanough Powhatan’s militant brother gestures
fiercely that Smith should ba killed

OPECHANCANOUGH
They are building a fortress Drive
them off now while they still are
weak or they will think we instead
are weak and come in numbers

Parahunt urges his father to exercise restraint

PARAHUNT

Don’t be harsh father Why should
you care about them as long as they do
not harm us They only want a little
swampland It does us no good If
they try to stay you can drive them
off whenever you want We outnumber
them a thousand to one

OPECHANCANOUGH
For now We cannot tell what will
happen later

POWHATAN
We shall find out what their
intentions are Thera is no reason to
waste lives If they do not leave
then wa shall attack

Powhatan raises his hand to signal that Smith will be
spared and nodding at Pocahontas declares

POWHATAN
He can make her beads and bells

One by one the Indians explode with laughter They rush
forward and slap him on the back pummel him make him eat
stand up and sit down

They carry him around on their shoulders as if he were a
conquering hero strip off his clothes dangle their
strands of pearl around his neck heap raccoon pelts on his
shoulders and thrust a crown of feathers on his head

Smith has no idea what to make of all this The moment
before they were ready to slaughter him and now they treat
him like their bosom friend His look of perplexity only
causes them to laugh the more Meanwhile Powhatan confers
with his advisors

POWHATAN

We shall watch them and wait
OPECHANCANOUGH

For what
POWHATAN

For whatever comes A dream
SMITH AND POCAHONTAS - LATER - DAY-FOR-NIGHT

Smith comes upon Pocahontas in the moonlight She shies
away and still it seems that she trusts him

SMITH
Don’t be afraid Your father says
that I’m to teach you --

He follows her deeper and deeper into the flickering
darkness She says something to him in pantomime but he
does not understand what she means

SMITH
They might chop off my head if I
don’t put sense in you

She swings back and forth on a rope strung from a high
branch The wind flutters her short skirt and his heart
skips a beat

SCENES OF INDIAN LIFE - MONTAGE

Led by Pocahontas Smith walks through Werowocomoco

marveling at the Indians’ way of life She is constantly
shooing away her host of simpering maids She points when
she wants him to do something sit down get up ete She
drops a leaf from her hand

POCAHONTAS
Pick that up please
the does)
And if I dropped it again

SMITH

I would pick it up again

(she smiles)
Would you like me always to do what
you wish Princess -- to follow you
in the woods when you say “come” -- to
chase you round the tree to catch you
and to lie down for you to throw
leaves on me and to be glad when you
are glad

POCAHONTAS
Yes

He is no longer the enlightened creedless man She is a
being sacred and apart She is so near that new world
whose existence he has only guessed at that it seems
brought near to him

Two young braves loll in a hammock smoking a pipe They
smile pleasantly at Smith and return to their tobacco
visions By nature they are a silent people The scolding
of a crow is loud above the normal sounds of the village

Powhatan sees Smith with his daughter He does not scowl
as an English father might In fact he feels a certain
amusement -- that she should let herself be amazed this

way as though by a strange bird He is a man free of

jealousy a man of deep understanding Yet while he does
not take her infatuation seriously he still must keep a
close watch on Smith to measure his utility to the Indian
cause

Youngsters play basketball on a strange court surrounded by
posts with nun-like faces carved in them Their elders
hunt stag in the groves between their gardens costumed in
the skins of their prey so that they can approach them
quite closely

They show Smith rabbit and fox tracks and speculate about
what transpired at their intersections They catch fish in
traps made of bound sticks and broil them with their
venison on hurdles’ over cutdoor fires

In the center of the corn fields stand high towers where
watchmen stand guard against the crowd Their cries and
the noise of their rattles ring constantly through the air

Indian mothers take to the water with their children on
their shoulders The men keep their bows with them When
they are in the water they tie their quivers to their hair
so their hands will be free They light great fires at
night to show their joy

Smith exchanges greetings with Parahunt and Wobblehead
Except for Opechancanough the Indians receive him as a
brother Gradually ha comas to find his English dress

constricting and piece by pieces he substitutes for it a
deerskin robe and headdress

Often they tease him mocking his English manners
especially his swordsmanship in the woods the morning he
was caught They hold no grudge against him They are
naked frolicsome full of good humor always inclined to
laugh which they do with irresistible grace

It is a pleasant sight to see them wading in the rivers in
the cool of the avening free of care living cheerfully
and at their hearts’ ease They do not seek more than they
need They share with their neighbors They overflow with
mercy and loving kindness They have no wants beyond what
the day provides Like tha lilies of the field they
neither toil nor spin yet Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed as one of these

TIGHT ON SMITH - “OTHER SIDE” MUSIC

It strikes Smith that there is some other way of existing
in this world outside the eternal circle of struggle and
desire Little by little he parts with the ideas that
clothe the soul of the European above all the idea that a
Man attains strength through force He assumas in some
measure the dress and manners of the Indians as he
discovers a self he never knew he had His civilized
brothers have lost something these Indians enjoy like the
very air they breathe Why should he ever wish to leave
this Eden

But even as he entertains these thoughts he half-knows he
will not honor them -- that the passionate conviction of
this autumn afternoon will one day seem a dream a passing
fancy For the moment however he is a free man He has
opened his eyes He can follow his vision or betray it

EXT CLEARING - POCAHONTAS AND SMITH
He sits with Pocahontas in a clearing He is giving her an

English lesson Har words have by now acquired a soft
Algonquin lilt

POCAHONTAS
You come from that way Yes What is
that way
SMITH

Nothing but ocean for months and
months
POCAHONTAS
Months What are they

SMITH
No matter The world is so large that
we only se a small part of it from
any one place Look

He traces a circle in the sand and puts a pebble in the
middle

SMITH
This is the spot we are standing on
And this is all that we can see from
here This is Virginia and these
woods if you walked in them for
years would be the world

POCAHONTAS
De you know all the world All the
mountains and rivers and all the
people in the world

SMITH
That would be impossible You imagine
the rest of the earth is like this
little part here But it’s not all
the same There are rivers and
mountains and

POCAHONTAS
(interrupting)
I can swim

SMITH
Across these rivers no There are
mountains that none can climb Beasts
that would gulp you down And with
great pleasure too

Astonished sha runs out to the edge of the woods
’ POCAHONTAS

Tall me whats there And there and
there Tell me

SMITH
Evan if I knew it would take teo long
to tell
POCAHONTAS

Hurry There is time What is beyond
the world

SMITH
Water only water Didn’t I say

POCAHONTAS
All around
(he nods)
Water no beyond Only water

SMITH
Look at the moon It is like that
with the world We cannot touch it
We cannot put our hands on it Bayond
the water that flows around the world
but far away -- so far that it would
take months and months in a ship to
reach them -- there are islands some
small othars as large as this land
here -- some where the people live in
snow and ice the whole year round
others where they go naked as a calf
But they are so far away so
impossible to reach that it’s useless
to speak of them They are like the
moon You don’t know it yet but
there are a thousand kings dukes
emperors and petty princes whose state
is greater than your father’s Youre
a wild creature that belongs to a
bygone aga

POCAHONTAS

Can you keep a bird on your finger
SMITH

No
POCAHONTAS

Can you catch a fish with your hands
Smith shakes his head no
THE SARCOPHAGUS OF HER ANCESTORS
Pocahontas has brought Smith to a long dim hut filled with
the bones of her ancestors Skeletons lie in perfect

silence on wicker platforms

SMITH
Who are they

POCAHONTAS
My ancestors Our fathers and
mothers All Their bones are here

She points to one of the skeletons

POCAHONTAS

My mother But not she Only her
body is turned to dust

(she toes the ground)
But she is away -- up there where the
stars are We do not die but go on
and on No one is lost I talk to
her Sometimes I say “Why do you
never answer when I speak” And when
I think she is quiet then she
whispers so Turn away

She imitates the voice of her mother’s spirit a ghostly
sound like the wind in the pines

POCAHONTAS

She lives in the clouds
SMITH

Oh yes
POCAHONTAS

Didn‘t you know All those books you
read what good are they Why do you
read them If they don’t teach you
this what do they teach you

SMITH
Other things

POCAHONTAS
What things Do they say who made the
clouds - or why Why your nose is
here not there Why you are you and
I am I

She looks up at thea sky with an open mouth in a sort of
ecstasy as though she were seeing it for the first time

POCAHONTAS
(series of jump cuts)
Tall me John - why can’t the wind
blow backwards Why do the trees love
the sky
(astonished)

You don’t know
(after a pause)
Turn away

She comes up behind him bends over and whispers

POCAHONTAS
Area the people in London as we are
Would they understand me

SMITH
No there’s none like you Not one

She laugha and runs off Smith follows her The Great

Rabbit

the Pamunkeys’ fierce god looks on

POCAHONTAS AND SMITH - MONTAGE

Time passes Fall colors have appeared in the trees
Pocahontas takes Smith to the river with her when she

bathes

Thay swim together naked She gives him

breakfast out of her own bowl and shows him her favorite
trees in the woods

She sits enthroned and watches the sham wars of the braves
as they hunt one another with headless arrows practice
feints and attacks

Passing her hands over a fire she gathers its light into
her heart

She tells Smith about the migrations of the birds shows
him where to find the turkeys’ nests and the blueberries
what bark to use for remedies Wild creatures come
fearlessly to her outstretched hand

She looks through a book of drawings of London that he
brought along in the boat

SMITH (0S)
Those are tha bells that cali the
people home and those ara white birds
-- they fly around the steeples
Those are the ships that sail along
the river That is a flag that
streams in the breeze And that a
great clock the greatest in all
England

She is astonished Smith has set her imagination on fire
Each is strange to the other each intrigued by the other’s
differences

POCAHONTAS
Will I ever sea these John I have
dreamed of them the steeples and the
boats on the river Will I die before
I sea them

SMITH

Probably

(after a pause)
Now that I have come hera I will
never be able to live in that world
again

(catching her hand)
Do you lika me to hold your hand

POCAHONTAS
Yes

She looks at herself in a mirror as she combs her hair
The comb is a device the Indians are unfamiliar with and
quite fascinated by

SMITH
Do you intend to spend the rest of
your life admiring yourself

POCAHONTAS
If I can

Nothing so lovely has aver been created He loves her as
he has never loved before never could love any other
being His former ambitions seem as nothing now paltry
commonplace unworthy of him He is a changed man and
this change is the proof that that old artificial life
never was and could not be the real one in harmony with
his true nature

OTHER ANGLES - POCAHONTAS AND SMITH - COMPASS

Pocahontas sits in the moonlight touching the palm of
Smith’s hand studying his fingers Har eyes are fixed on
him with a look ha finds strangely soft and flattering
She loves everything She has a soul of innocent zest
She listens to his heart and laughs with delight She
looks at his compass the magic little box utterly awed
as though she believed you could make wishes on it

POCAHONTAS
Am I dreaming

He sees that she is asking in earnest but when he attempts
to reply sha touches his lips with her finger and asks

POCAHONTAS
Why do you not answer me -- speak to
me -- speak to me like this

He understands He is learning to speak this new language
of the eyes as gradually the ideal becomes real to him

POCAHONTAS (0S)

Is he a god What are these feelings

that I have He has come into my

heart His eyes are like a lake and

T am his

Smith gives her lessons in astronomy He explains the

motions of the sun the earth and the moon

moon running circles around Pocahontas who plays the sun

He plays the

while her maids the stars mova along beside them in
stately procession She loves it when he cuts up for her

friends He watches them cavort through the

POCAHONTAS (0S)
He has no evil in him and is

trees above

beautiful to look at His words are
gentle and his desire is to be always
with me We shall go beyond where the

world ends

One afternoon while alone sha finds him carrying logs

POCAHONTAS

Rest a moment My father is away this

afternoon Here I will help you

SMITH
Under no circumstances I will not
see you dishonored

POCAHONTAS
It would dishonor me less than you

I

would do it more easily I want to

You do not

SMITH
I don’t know if the young men ever

tell you but youre -- a little pixie

He sats down his load She puts her hands on her
shoulders to cover her breasts and closes her eyes She
cannot believe the grace and beauty these gods have

POCAHONTAS
(embarrassed)

How people are where you live I do

net know
(he smiles at her)
Are you a prince

SMITH
No

She rolls her eyes She does not believe him

POCAHONTAS
Do you love me

SMITH
At this moment more than anyone in
the world
(she stares up into
the trees)
Why are you doing that

POCAHONTAS
Because I do not deserve you Why
should man like to kiss

SMITH
Let me show you

POCAHONTAS

(after they kiss)
Now I see I am afraid I am your
wifa if you will marry me If not
then I am your servant -- whether you

(suddanly alarmed)
I don’t know why I talk this way
Sometimes I seam younger than I am

Smith stumbles She frowns

SMITH
I lost my balance

POCAHONTAS
Where did you lose it

Smith looks at her and marvels

SMITH

wish all you pretty creatures would

EXT POWHATAN’S LODGE

Outside his lodge the Emperor sees Smith’s armor hanging
from a tree He shrugs off his long robes and lights his

pipe When the tobacco has taken its effect he lies back”

and closes his eyes
POWHATAN’S DREAM - STRANGE LANDSCAPE TREE STAIRCASE

Powhatan finds himself in a land he has never seen before
surrounded by strange flowers and animals Ranks of clouds
move through the sky

A man stands before him and shows by a gesture that he has
come from the west and that he means to marry his daughter
They will spawn a new race

All at once a tree takes root in front of him and begins to
grow at astonishing speed higher and higher until it
reaches into the heavens Powhatan steps through the bark
of the tree Inside he discovers a winding staircase He
climbs the staircase his shadow climbing ahead of hin

EXT RIVER

The afternoon is sweet and drowsy Smith and Pocahontas
lie in a peaceful spot along the river They have managed
to elude her retinue

POCAHONTAS
No one knows where we arg You can
escape if you want to They’d never
catch you Got

Smith shakes his head He does not wish to

POCAHONTAS
I was testing you

Yielding to a swift impulse Smith puts his arms around
her presses her to him and kisses her forehead Then he
is frightened -- when she goes so pale closing her eyes
so that the long dark lashes lie still on her cheeks when
she sighs with answering love He runs his hand over her
young shoulders wondering how much she knows She
unhitchesa her apron She is without shame Smith has
never seen anything so beautiful She sinks to her knees
and draws him gently down beside her

SMITH
Do you know what you’ re doing

POCAHONTAS
Do you
he nods)
Then why are you afraid

SMITH
Afraid

They are silent for a time Then she gets back up and
slips her apron on smiling at him mysteriously

She takes his ‘hand puts it to her heart her forehead
She rubs her nose against his then quietly slips off into
the pines At last they close around her and she is gone

Smith feels happy and triumphant Shivers run through his
limbs and a vague alarm This is the beginning of -- what
He walks around to get on terms with these new sensations
To hold in his fingers such a wild flower to put it to his
lips and feel it tremble with delight against them What
intoxication and -- embarrassment What to do with her --
how to meet her next tima

Returning through the woods he sees his guards waving to
him The Emperor has summoned him

INT POWHATAN’S LODGE - SMOKE - CG PARAKEET

Smith enters Powhatan’s lodge He understands Algonquin
now and does not have to wait for an interpretation though
he replies to Powhatan in English

POWHATAN
I think your people come to take our
land away

40
Smith has come to feel a bond with Powhatans people that
he did not feel before Ha wants to speak honestly
Because ha cannot he keeps silent

POWHATAN

Go back to them and tell them what you
have seen You can say that we are
weak that we lie around in our
hammocks the whole day long and can
be taken with your muskets Or you
can say that though we live in paace
we yat are strong that you have seen
an Empire all of whose sons and
daughters nephews and nieces are
ready to die to preserve their land
at their King’s command You can say
that his kingdom is very great that
it extends for many weeks’ journey
that he has green fields and great
storehouses of corn What ‘you all
them will either discourage them or
arouse their lust Tell them what you
know

SMITH
I shall

POWHATAN
You Tassantasses ask what lies to the
west beyond the mountains and the
falls Believe ma there is no
saltwater The rivers dwindle into
streams The hills rise up in
forests But there is no sea to the
west only the land stretching away
forever in great meadows where
wanderers follow tha buffalo herds

SMITH
Has anyone gone so far he can say
that

POWHATAN
Remember that while you are a
Tassantasse and the son of your King
you are my son too We must not
spend our lives fighting one another
There is no sense in taking by force
what you may have for love or
destroying those who provide you with
food What can you get by war when we
can hide our stores and fly to the
woods You would famish for wronging
us your friends

(MORE
POWHATAN (cont’d)
Bo you think I am so foolish not to
Know that it is better to aat good
meat to sleep peacefully with my
women and children to laugh and ba
merry with you to have copper and
hatchets and other goods than to be
forced to flee to lie cold in the
woods to feaad on acorns and roots and
be hunted by you so that I can neither
rest nor eat nor sleep What I say
is true The earth hears me The sea
hears me Shall I lie

SMITH
I trust not

POWHATAN
My councillors tell me that I should
have you killed You have gained a
knowledge of our arms and our strong
places But my daughter assures that
you are a good man and I do not like
to kill Men should live in peace
What need is there to hate and kill
and steal We take what we need We
ask no more We belong to this earth
Wa were made when this earth was made
Why do you bother us What kind of
people to you think we are Let the
streams of life flow in peace Let us
change this earth and make it better
All the people in the world ought to
love it and speak well of it always
Then it will last forevar and the
trees will never cease to bloom

SMITH
I hope as you do for quiet days and
long life I believe wa can live in
peace

POWHATAN

Then leave us You will turn the
world upside down Looking for what
you might have found at home Go back
where you came from Wa are stronger
than you We shall destroy you if you
don’t I will send you back with a
supply of food We give you this and
no more

Powhatan dips his hands in ashes and washes then
thoroughly then rinses them in another bowl and dries them
on a bunch of feathers

An attendant steps forward and gives hima pipe da
inhales deeply and passes it to Smith

POWHATAN
I wonder who you are Smith I look
at you and I think “There’s nothing
ill can dwell in him” I hope the
time will never come when I shall say
I should have killed this fine man
Can I trust you more now than when you
first came to this city

Smith smiles at Powhatan more than an admirer -- in awe of
him

SMITH
I believe so I baliave anyway that
we can work out our differences I
will do all that I can to see that it
is done

POWHATAN
(nodding)
Before you leave I offer you this
vanity of mine It was brought to me
from a land to the South

Indian dancers enter singing wild melodies and present
him with a brilliant Carolina parakeet

EXT POWHATAN’S LODGES

The Indians bid Smith a fond farewell They have gained a
deep respect for him and he for them Opechancanough
alona does not smile

EXT WOODS - SMITH AND POCAHONTAS - LATER
Smith walks along with his arm over Pocahontas’ shoulder

POCAHONTAS
I imagined you would never leave us
I had no right to think so There are
many things I want to say What is
going to happen

SMITH
What do you mean

POCAHONTAS
You wont forget me

He looks at her It strikes him that he has fallen in love
with a near child

SMITH
You trust me
POCAHONTAS
Yes -- Ido Think of me alone days

and days in the wood waiting for
you all the tima saying “Come
quickly John How long you are” Oo
John how happy we shall ba

SMITH
I must go Tha favor of kings is a
slippery boon Thay withdraw it as
lightly as they grant it

POCAHONTAS
I will not be troubled As little as
the sky I will watch for your
signal

She walks quickly off
NEW ANGLE

Smith picks up his armor and slings it over his shoulder
The braves who will conduct him to the fort tie a blindfold
around his eyes

Pocahontas watches him go confident things will work out
for the best When her father comes upon her she gives
him an uneven look

POWHATAN
I want you to promise me one thing
That you will put your people before
all alse in the world - even your own
heart

She nods
EXT A PATH THROUGH THE WOODS

Blindfolded smith follows the caravan of Indians through
the woods

EXT JAMESTOWN FORT

Smith walks down the road to the Jamestown fort It is
just after sunrise The English sentries are fast asleep
The Indians stop a hundred feet away Smith locks up The
gates are decorated with the skulls of deer and bear What
will stepping back into this other world mean Will he
forget It seams he goes forward by a conscious act of
will

A sentry wakes up He gasps at the Indian caravan then at
Smith himself -- this man whom they had given up for dead
to discover him so utterly changed

SENTRY
Captain Smith

He goes running through the colony to announce Smith’s
arrival

SECOND SENTRY
The Savages will have to stop here
Captain Raasons of security
under his breath)
Wea don’t want ‘em to know we’re
mortal

Smith gestures to the Indians that they should set their
gifts down They are only too glad to leave

NEW ANGLE - SMITH ASTONISHED AT THE CHANGE

Within tha walls of the fort everything is topsy-turvy
Along the street of sailcloth roofs the houses are falling
down the few that have been completed The men limp out
of their tents and dugouts pale with rickets and
dysentery like the inmates of a concentration camp

Smith finds WILE the cabin boy drawing water His feet
are dusty and bleeding He has bowed legs and sharp ugly
eyes Yet still he is as swaggering a boy as ever stood
four feet six inches tall He offers Smith a drink

WILP
You have to quaff it now Somebody
else wants the tumbler

SMITH
What’s happened here Where is
Captain Newport

WILF
Gone back to England sir with all
three ships -- to get supplies new
men He left Captain Ratcliffe in his
place

SMITH
And Ratcliffa where is he

WILF

evasively)

Why -- he’s gone sir We expect he

perished Nobody knows
(MORE)
WILF (cont’d)
I mean there’s talk about this and
that but nobody knows in the proper
sense of the word One day he just
vanished like a ghost

Ill-looking faces jut out of doors register amazement
then withdraw inte the darkness The dirty juvenile with

the manners of a man begins to whisper worried he will be
overheard

WILF

Since you left half of ‘em has died
Crops all failed Seeds won’t take
root We got nothing to eat This
morning there’s another four gone
You find them laying out on the
doorstep dogs sniffing them the ones
they still hadn’t sat to eatin’ I
grew up in Brighton but I swear
before Almighty God I never sean the
like The gangs they bully around
and steal from the store gamble and
keep us all on short rations whilst
they have their fill

(over such scenes)
They don’t fool me They cuff me
about but I just looks at them cold-
like you see They know what I’m
thinking Hoho Don’t they imagine I
got my own ways of dealing with
things No oh no by no means

He slyly removes a knife from the crown of his hat

WILF
Don’t fret your ayelids on that score
They bowl while the houses fall down
Nobody pays attention or obeys the
other’s commands Be a charmer don’t
noise it about I told you so

Suddenly Wingfield walks up and cuffs the boy aside

WINGFIELD
Winsome boy I feel about him as
though he were my own son

He struts around like a Japanese swordsman all glower and
bluster backed by six other pirates armed with swords and
Matchlocks

WINGFIELD
You look quite well Smith Been
enjoying yourself have you Been
enjoying yourself mightily I expect

46
From his regimen of venison and corn Smith looks
shockingly haalthy next to tha other Englishmen evan

Wingfield and his hanchmen who have fared batter than the
rest

WINGFIELD
You were sent to relieve our
situation not to pleasure yourself
We here have suffered
(nodding at Wilf)
Been telling you a lot of stories has
e

SMITH
As a good citizen I ignora the
stories which bring officialdom into
disrepute

WINGFIELD
No speeches Smith Things are
different now We can’t get away with
cheek Allow cheek and wa shall have
chaos I wear a medal now I am the
President You were stripped of your
captaincy

SMITH
May I know why

WINGFIELD
Someday yes but let’s not talk about
that now As a matter of fact you’d
be considerably happier if you didn’t
make my job more tiring than it
already is You shortly will be
arrested in the nama of His Lordship
King James and confined to the
fortress

SMITH
What is the charge against me if I
may know

WINGFIELD
Caused the death of two good
Englishmen Then you deserted
Furthermore you have allowed the
Naturals to see the state of our
extremity

SMITH
Are you qualified to pass judgment on
me
WINGFIELD
That needn’t concern you at present
Pity you were not here to defend

yourself in person at the trial I
assume your guilt made you afraid to
return

He waits to see if Smith will be provoked into defi
but Smith only stares at him ances

SMITH
My trial

WINGFIELD
You were tried during the period of
your desertion

SMITH
This does not amuse me

WINGFIELD
Then you will be even less amused to
learn that you were condemned to
death

Crazy with hunger the English fall madly on Powhatan’s

gifts cheering Smith as a hero His parakeet flies away

WINGFIELD
What did you offer them in return for
these bats’ tails and whathave-you

Ha gestures contemptuously at Powhatan’s gifts while his
cronies bully tha others out of the way to make sure they
get tha lion’s share

WINGFIELD
Nocturnal creatures

He sticks his sword into a raccoon and throws it to a man
to whom ha owas a favor

- WINGFIELD

to his henchmen)
Send them a dozen of those red top
hats And the bed in which Master
Godfrey died since none will sleap in
it And Nelson’s cur The ever so
poxey one They haven’t one of those
I suppose

He points to a sickly greyhound Argall steps forward and

speaks directly to Smith ignoring Wingfield

ARGALL
He keeps the best food for himself
Captain and gives us rotten corn
Being an atheist he has no Bible
which you can go down there right now
and prove Youll find ha also has a
Spanish grammar for reasons which are
unclear except perhaps to a Papist
scholar

Smith studies the motley crew He has just come from
people who asked for nothing and gave away everything in
return He feels a disgust with their selfishness greed
and complaint He sees in them the person he was four
months ago and must never allow himsalf to be again

ARGALL
He was planning to take the boat and
leave us here while he ran off to
Newfoundland His name is net even
Wingfield Woodson -- Woodson’s the
Mame Charming Left England under a
cloud of disgrace he did A master
forger Charming in tha extreme
Ever so charming

WINGFIELD
Seize them Anyone impeding the
punishment of these rogues will be
dealt with harshly

Wingfield’s man move to arrest Smith and Argall Smith
draws his sword They challenge him with theirs but they
are no match evan in numbers With dazzling skill he
dispatches three of them As the crowd sees his strength
and the chance to turn the tide of things at the fort they
join him Wingfield’s man are soon overpowered

WINGFIELD
You want to get rid of me eh Give
me the old heave-ho Let me tell you
there’s not a square-head here man
enough to gat away with that Don’t
start anything you can’t finish Will
you all be witnesses to this Stop
now or I shall report this mutiny to
London It could be ugly

ARGALL
Quite ugly

A sword tip explodes through Wingfield’s armor Argall has
come up behind him and run him through Smith stares at
Argall stunned by this naked act of murder
The others seem accustomed to such i

ni -
for the entertainment goings-on and grateful
FIRST MAN

Dead as a ‘erring Serve ‘im right
Puttin’ on airs

With a flick of his sword Smith sends the murd
flying from Argall’s hands er weapon

ARGALL
I was only trying to help you

SMITH
Arrest this man

A man named Small steps forward

SMALL

I can ratify what Mr Argall said

(toeing Wingfield)
He refused to give me a chicken or
return the whistle I gave him in
payment for it In fact one morning
while conniving with his friend Mr
Ackley here he aven refused to give
me a spoonful of beer Were we in
England I should be ashamed to let my
servant keep company with such
fellows

ACKLEY
You never had a servant You were
one I ate a single chicken and that
when I was very ill Small here ‘as
eaten six a number of which he could
not be troubled to cook For myself I
can prove that he begged in Ireland

like a regue without a license I
know his games I know the criminal
mind

Argall steps forward swallowing his pride

ARGALL
I say it’s Captain Smith should lead
us

The men raise a cheer of agreement After all he has
saved them from starvation Ackley strips the President’s
medallion off Wingfield and puts it over Smith’s neck
With a wave of his hand Smith rescinds the order for
Argall’s arrest

SMITH

If I lead you youll listen to ma and
respect my orders The gentlemen will
be obliged to bend their backs and
obey with the rest JI haven’t had the
opportunity to look into it but it
seems that quite a few of you imagine
that you’re still in London 111 be
a worse tyrant than this man was

(nodding at Wingfield)
So make up your minds We are not
going to have an easy time with the
Naturals We are superior to them in
arms but not in numbers nor in
character They are a formidable
enemy Unless we leave by spring
they will attack us If you don’t put
things in order they will see how
great our need is and be tempted to
attack before then It appears we
might have picked a poxey spot to
land And you thought you’d come to
the land of Cockaigne But that’s a
matter I’1l take up with Captain
Newport when he returns Meanwhile
it will be all wa can do to survive
These gifts will last a month And
soon the snows will fly But witha
united will we can hold out and
shall What say you then

The men raise a great cheer Smith finds himself beaming
with pleasure at their approbation They snatch up his
gifts and carry him off on their shoulders

INT PRESIDENT’S OFFICE

Smith enters the office reserved for the Prasident of the
Colony There is a bust of King James a crucifix a globe
and astrolabe -- serious badges of office and English
refinement in primitive Jamestown He caresses them with
his hand Suddenly he laughs out loud So fortune has
tossed him up for’a while How long will he ride the wave

EXT JAMESTOWN - MONTAGE INC POCAHONTAS’ POV

Smith walks around the fort supervising its restoration
New buildings go up a brickworks a potter’s shed and a
pit saw He is not above rolling up his own sleeves to
help in the work

The men quarrel over everything building a wall portions
eof food the date of the year

SL

(Thase scenes will be improvised Sm i
disputes in a wise clever way his qualities oe their
leadership make all the man look up to him He continues
to wear his unconventional wardrobe -- feather headdress
buckskins war paint He even insists on sleeping outside
on the ground as he did at Werowocomoco The routine of ‘
his life his former thoughts and ambitions seem futile
now and artificial What shall he do

NEW ANGLE

Smith is joking with Ben Ackley and some of the other men
when a fallow with a serious look interrupts him

FIRST MAN
What about the gold Captain

SMITH
What do you mean

FIRST MAN
Have you told us everything I mean
did you see anything that raised your
hopes of a hatter life

SMITH
Gold you mean What do you care
about gold Youre on the verge of
starving This is the most valuable
thing I brought you back

He holds out a handful of corn seed

FIRST MAN
Who gave it to you —

SMITH
A friend

SECOND MAN
What about the soil Captain Is it
goed as we thought

SMITH
(avoiding their eyes)
Not really In fact I’ve rarely seen
so ill-appearing a pesthole Look
about you Everything’s gone to
swamp with water standing in lakes
and pools so the ground gives way
beneath your feet I suspect theres
more puddles than dry land producing
more mosquitoes in their slime than
there are beads in a nunnery -- and
each mosquito as hungry as a priest
(MORE)

SMITH (contd)
None but a savage could inhabit the
Place unless he was a bloody fool or
some other manner of ass But west of
here towards the mountain or south --
that is something else

It still is not clear what line Smith will be able to walk
between his duty to the English and his sympathy for the
Indians He looks off toward the woods The pines sway
back and forth in eestasy

EXT CHICKAHOMINY RIVER - SHALLOP

Smith runs a flag up into the rigging of the shallop and
prepares to set sail The English wonder at this action

ARGALL
Where are you going

SMITH
(avoiding their eyes)
Where you would not dare to follow

ARGALL
Don’t you think you should take some
men with you It would be dangerous
sailing by yourself

SMITH
Let them come if thay please

Ackley speaks with Smith privately

ACKLEY
Watch them sir They are a dangerous
lot

SMITH

Are you all right

ACKLEY
To tell the truth I don’t know how
much longer I can last Captain I
seen too much

SMITH
You‘1ll last my friend Have hope

Smith boards the shallop and with a squad of English
soldiers sets out up the river

SMITH
Post a sentry at the point The rest
of you wait for me here If they come
to look at you leave them alone

He collects a sack of copper hatchets beads combs and red
hats - the English wares most popular with the natives

EXT DEEP FOREST SMITH’S POVS

Smith stops and looks around The half-moon has just
risen The trees beckon him on They seem to run off to
the uttermost ends of the earth

His romance with the Indian girl seems far off unreal

Has he put himself in a false position What ara his
intentions He almost dreads seaing her - would it not be
almost a relief if she did not appear -- and yet when she
does not come right away he feels vexed and disappointed
By the confidence with which she walks her path she
convinces him that another way exists than that which his
feet have known She releases his soul from its captivity
She breaks up the frozen sea of his heart He conceives
hopes that he never imagined it was in his power to
conceive the walls of his habitual life fall away and
leave him in a wide field in that new world which he
hitherto sought in vain and which he now knows not by
setting his foot on the Virginia shore but in the sight of
her in her touch in the joy and grace she radiates

By and by he hears the sound of footsteps He sees her
coming toward him and in a voice that seems not quite his
he says her name She seems to look right into him He
never before realized the depth and purity the touching
faithfulness of her dew-bright eyes He feels his heart
and senses unfolding She is all simple nature and beauty
as much a part of this October evening as the falling
leaves How should he not take all that she would give
him how not fulfill the spring in her heart and his What
did he know of love until he seized her hand and kissed
it And now -- what does he not know

Their lips seek each other’s and still they do not speak
The moment speech begins all will be unreal

SMITH
Why did you come here

She looks up hurt amazed

POCAHONTAS
Sir You asked me to

SMITH
Dont call me sir my pretty sweet

POCAHONTAS
What shall I call you

SS

SMITH
John

POCAHONTAS
What have you sean Your eyes are
like -- stones

SMITH

(after a pause)
I’va had nothing but aggravation
Half are sick the others lunging at
each other’s throats like they were in
Brighton Way They’d do anything for
money Theyd risk damnation in this
world and the next And me a good
man by any lights moving among such
people

POCAHONTAS
Send them away

SMITH

Away

(after a silence)
How many lands behind me How many
seas What blows dangers My soul
hungered after far horizons Now
there is only this contention with
fools this ignoble war with little
things

(pacing)
It has always been so I can never
stay on land for long It scorches my
feet It always disappoints There
is comfort and safety in the port
hearthstone and supper warm blankets
friends But always I find that I
still am not where I must be Always
shut up somewhere Cut off Starved

POCAHONTAS
Look before you We cauld live in the
woods I know a place There is a
waterfall there A bed of moss I’ve
never shown it to anyone I waited
(caressing his face)
My brother will take care of us He
told me that he would Make a sign
John Tell me if I should keep on
(suddenly alarmed)
I wish for you when you’re gone I
look for you I wonder if the others
can tell
Smith reaches for her but she skips back out of reach

POCAHONTAS
It was never so before

Smith looks at her with love rising in his heart like the

scent of a crushed herb Her heart is a nest untouched by
grief

SMITH
Can it be that we have met again
That I can look again into your eyes --
hold you again in my arms at last
And I so changed -- so different
Have I answered you -- have I come to
you

POCAHONTAS
(in a whisper)
YesNo it is not you
after a moment)
Is it you

SMITH
Say it again my sweet Speak I
cannot live or breathe until I-am next
to you and I can feel your hand

POCAHONTAS
I waited -- watched -- so many days --

SMITH
And I treated you so unkindly Ah my
guardian angel my light in the
darkness how I hate myself for giving
you pain There is something I know
when I am with you that I forget when
I am away Tell me my sweet did you
wish me to come back and live with you
again

BOCAHONTAS
(suddenly afraid)
You must not look into my eyes You
must not touch me

SMITH
I must hold your hand when I speak
with you

He at last has found a passage to the other sea He steps
up to her and touches her belly She is - so open so
unafraid He bobs like a cork on the ocean of her
movements

EXT TREES OVERHEAD - SMITH’S AWAKENING

The world spins to a stop The moon peers at Smith th

rough
the pines Flecks of moss drift down from the upper
branches

SMITH
We can’t go into the forest Could I
show you England I would take care
of you I promise I would never be a
brute to you But no it is too far
You would perish there

POCAHONTAS
If I can be with you that is all

He gazes at her She is a lady a flower a jewel The
woods murmur about them He looks out on a new creation a
landscape as lovely as a lost Eden O his America his new
found land how blessed he is in discovering her and in
full nakedness unbound The curtain is liftad and he
sees with the eyes of his soul But even as he does and
knows this is what he has always been waiting for striving
for he fears that he might be overwhelmed -- that he might
not be equal to what he has known but disintegrate under
its pressure There is a temptation to rush back into the
comforting darkness of his former life

EXT INDIAN CAMP

Smith has no luck trading at a nearby camp Huddled in
their fur robes by a blazing fire the Indians point to the
sky Soon winter will ba here

EXT CHICKAHOMINY RIVER

On his way back to the boat Smith runs into one of the
English sentries

SMITH
What are you doing here

SENTRY
I beg your pardon sir You were gone
longer than wa expected Appears I
let myself wander a bit Things go
badly

Like the others he is under the impression that Smith’s
purpose here was to trada with the Indians Smith does not
reply The sentry smiles vaguely aware that his captain
is hiding something

EXT SHALLOP MOVING DOWNRIVER

They are vocal with the songs of birds and running water

EXT JAMESTOWN FORT
During Smith’s absence there has been a stabbing

SMITH
And what was your disagreement about

STABBED MAN
He said it was the fifteenth of
November I said the seventeenth

SMITH
You were fighting about the date of
the year

ASSAILANT
Not entirely He made comments to the
effect that my education was something
less’n his

SMITH
Iam gone two days and you fall right
back into your old ways What has
been going on here Didn’t I tell you
to dig a new well -- farther from tha
river Why hasn’t this bean dona

They offer thair excuses Smith feels uneasy Has his
romance with Pocahontas caused him to shirk his duty This
feeling of guilt -- utterly unjustified guilt -- sends him

into a rage

SMITH
Every man will stop what he is doing
right now and start digging the well
Thosa that can’t carry the dirt in
buckets will carry it off with their
hands

drinks from my heart like a deer from

DISSOLVE TO
EXT VIRGINIA LANDSCAPES - SNOW - POCAHONTAS

The winter snow tumbles down veiling the fort and the
fields beyond the woods and rocky shores in white seeming
nowhere to alight It falls too on the Indian longhouses
and the dark Chesapeake waves It lies thickly drifted on
the crooked crossas and headstones of the Jamastown
graveyard on the spears of the little gate and the thorns
that lie beneath it

WILE
(to Smith afraid)
The oysters are gone from the shore
sir and the birds that were in the
trees

Drawing Smith’s jacket tight about her shoulders
Pocahontas watches the snow Presently she looks up as a
white owl flies overhead

POCAHONTAS (0S)
Where is he now His head lies on my
heart Carry my love to him

EXT JAMESTOWN FORT

Smith watches too as the English wander around in the
grip of malaria and blackwater fever raving like madmen
Epidemic has done in more than half of them starvation the
rest Less than fifty people remain alive of the original
two hundred Every morning there are half a dozen new
deaths The corpses are dumped in the river no one has
the strength to dig in the frozen ground

ANGRY MAN
Somebody should shoot Jonson there
He hasn’t got a ghost of a chance and
he’s going to contaminate us all He
used Wortham’s spoon -- now Wortham’s
gone My friend Have we got to wait
till all is dead Here he comes now

The men dodge out of Jonson’s way and pick up rocks to
throw at him in case he comes too close

JONSON
I’ve only got a couple more days
Captain The men can eat me if they
like I should like to be helpful in
whataver way I can

SMITH
Thank you Jonson We shall cali upon
you if we have to

OTHER ANGLES

Brawls erupt over food and small possessions The settlers
boil their belts and harnesses and eat them They commit
murder for matches They eat dogs cats even rats But
civilization even such as it exists begins to work its
effect on Smith Every one of his compatriots is an avenue
that leads him back into his former ways of thinking

Wilf the cabin boy cheers him with memories of youth and
home

Are you happy

My eyes - how green how green

Asking all these questions

Smith laughs The domestic intimacy of the fort brings him
around and makes the magic city and even Pocahontas seem
unreal Did he really make love to her really promise to
take her away to live with him The notion that he could
make her his mistress fills him with a sort of horror even
while it still whips and stings his blood He wonders what
came into him He feels he has been awful then in the
Next moment that his behavior was quite sane

SOLDTER
Sir Ackley’s dead And directly
somebody ate his hands

NEW ANGLE

Smith finds Ackley sitting in a chair in his Sunday best
the end of a musket in his mouth

SOLDIER
(pilfering Ackley’s things)
Went out in the ‘eight of style
anyhow Such tranquility - look at
him Youd think he could speak

His hands have been chopped off and taken for food The
sight of it turns Smith’s stomach

SECOND SOLDIER
I shall miss him I think we all

shall

SMITH
Bury him And put this in the morning
report

SECOND SOLDIER
Are you quite sure sir

SMITH ©
Spare no detail

TIGHT ON SMITH

Again he thinks about her He agonizes over what he should
do Only a few months ago ha held her to him under the
blue strong sky kissing her eyes and lips He gasps
swept by this rush of remembrance and is back with her
again back in the rapture of his kisses on her upturned
face of innocence and humble passion back in the suspense
and beauty of that pagan night

He looks around him What would the others think of such
wild unlawful loving He wonders if he really loves her
or if he only wants her because she is so pretty and loves
him

EXT JAMESTOWN FORT - INDIAN PROCESSION - MUSIC

The English line the walls of the fort Beyond it lies a
sight to astonish them Pocahontas is leading agreat ‘
procession of Indians toward the gates - braves with
carcasses of deer and braces of turkey slung from poles
ever their shoulders women with large reed baskets of
cernbread and raccoon

NEW ANGLE

Pocahontas and Smith find themselves alone for a moment as
the English fete their red saviors overwhelmed by this
gratuitous act of ganerosity

- POCAHONTAS
They all bow to you The President
My father will not let ma bring you
anything more He says we hardly have
enough for ourselves

SMITH
I understand
POCAHONTAS
I will do what I can
” SMITH
Don’t put yourself in danger You
needn’t do anything more - for us
POCAHONTAS

If your people are hungry they can
find shellfish under tha ice

Pocahontas looks puzzled Smith casts about for the thing
he wants to say What doas he risk doing to her Has he
done it already
Somewhere in his heart he knows he will betray her and

though he does not wish it ha knows i
certainty it with an utter

SMITH
Don’t trust me

POCAHONTAS
Why do you say that

SMITH
You don’t know who I am

POCAHONTAS
Of course I do John Why shouldn’t
I do anything I can for you I love
you I like to show you that I do
Does it make you uncomfortable when
they see you with ma

SMITH
Sometimes

POCAHONTAS
I would be near you You know that
from the way I look at you don’t you

SMITH
Yes Yes I do my love

POCAHONTAS
Why have you not come to me

SMITH
Thera are people dying around me here

POCAHONTAS
I know it is a terrible thing to say
but how can you stay with them John
They’ re so fierce They’re so dirty
too No wonder they dia
(after a silence)
What canyou have to do lova

Living at the fort Smith has come to see things with
English eyes again Her age and her openness the very
things that he treasures embarrass him somewhat He
remembers that at certain times he adores her at other
times he can hardly recall who the person was that felt
this way He is aware of a new world a reality whose
existence he never had guessed or penetrated through to
The whole scheme of his former life has been called into
question and seems to him now like an illusion But that
does not make it any less problematic rather far more so

wr

SMITH
Does your mother speak with you still
POCAHONTAS
Yes She speaks in silence like the
stars And if I do not answer she

says “What could I say to you that I
have not told you in my own language
Is it my fault that you have net
understood me You think I wished to
speak to your eyes and ears and it
was my heart that spoke to you In
truth it was the heartof all the
earth that spoke to you through mine”

She igs not here but up there -- far
SMITH

She is dead and cannot hear you

Speak with me dear -- I am living and

can answer

NEW ANGLE

The English give the Princess a round of applause as she

leaves Passing back through
comes to a stop Wobblehead
met long ago in the longhcuse
the fort during the night and

Smith watches as the fool an
mount an imaginary beast
into laughter

the gates of the fort Smith

the lunatic Indian whom Smith
at Werowocomoco has coma to

is entertaining the men

excellent mime pretends to

One by one the colonists break
They seam to know nothing of Smith’s

romance and would not even hold it against him if they did
They respect him they depend on him

BLACKSMITH
He’s coming to England with us I
‘ave agreed to become his manager I
expect I shall soon be entertaining
divers offers

Woabblehead nods and points over the seas Englands
diraction A suspicious dog answers in the distance The
crowd melts away It is their uneasiness more than
anything else which causes Smith to ask if they were
amusing themselves at his expense

Ha strides around as though looking for a confrontation
Why should he feel any tie to this sorry lot and their
selfish plans”

SMITH
You what were you laughing at

SMIRKING FELLOW
Why I can’t be sure An idea that I
‘ad in me ‘ead Did I offend sir I
must be going I got me chores

He slinks off Smith wonders how much he knows

POCAHONTAS

Pocahontas walks along with a frown What is she to make
of Smith’s words

EXT A CORN FIELD NEAR THE FORT - LATER
Spring has come bringing sunny weather

Indian scouts sneak up to a field near tha fort a sunken
enclosure camouflaged with vines They strip the vines
back and peer inside Befora them stand row upon row of
green shoots six inchas high -- baby corn plants The
Indians’ leader darts inside and uproots one to take back
to the Emperor

INT POWHATAN’S LODGE

Powhatan tosses the corn plant down in front of his
daughter His voice is soft and loving

POWHATAN

They do not mean to leave

pausa)
This does not surprise me What does
is how they found the seed and where
to plant it This the Tassantasses do
not know And how did they find the
other things -- the oysters the
turkeys’ aggs

When Pocahontas starts to speak he cuts her off Hea does
not require an answer to these questions

POWHATAN
He will forget you

POCAHONTAS
Have you no kind word for me father

POWHATAN
No

She jumps to her feet and leaves

EXT POWHATAN’S LODGE

Powhatan throws open the door of his lodge Opechanc

anou
and the Chiefs of his Armies understand him and with a a
great shout repair to their units

EXT JAMESTOWN FORT

A single native scout observes a cross standing in tha
midst of the wilderness Then coming into sight of the
fort he solemnly plants three arrows in the road outside
its walls to serve warning of tha Emperor’s intentions
The English are by now accustomed to strange anties from
the Indians and give the business no thought

SENTRY
Spearing gophers

The Indian reaches into a pouch mumbles an incantation and
casts a handful of dust in the sentry’s direction

EXT RIVER - INDIAN CAMPS

Powhatan casts tobacco leaves on the streaming grey waters
eof the Chickahominy to satisfy himself that the omens area
good The camps are a hive of silent activity as the
Indians prepare to make war Braves plunge their spears
into a log working up their courage with whoops and cries
They put on paint and smoke tobacco say prayers and bid
goodbye to their children Allies gather from distant
camps Streams of warriors become whole rivers

Pocahontas looks on with alarm
EXT WEROWOCOMOCO - DUSK

As dusk settles Pocahontas walks around Werowocomoco
shivering like a frightened deer

INT POWHATAN’S TEMPLE - DUSK

Powhatan has come to his principal temple to meditate
before the sacred hearth The dancing firelight gives him
the appearance of a great conjurer

POWHATAN
Find my daughter

A brave clacks a hollow log
EXT TOBACCO FIELDS - POCAHONTAS - DUSK

Pocahontas hears the drums Suddenly she makes a
decision

ag

With an air of nonchalance she ambleas through the main

gate into tha tobacco fields beyond onl
Ydols see hee gon Y miy the great wooden

Looking back from the cool dark rows of tobacco her
eaneen eam to her like people she knew in some time long
past ith a sob rising to her throat she turn

off into tha woods and Funs

EXT WOODS - DUSK

Pocahontas crashes through the moonlit woods in a panic
The pinas sway back and forth like a wild sea

She stops for a moment to listen to the drums but they
only harden her determination and she starts running
again

EXT JAMESTOWN FORT - DAY-FOR-NIGHT
Pocahontas wakes up the English sentry at Jamestown

SENTRY
The Princess

POCAHONTAS
Please gat him Hurry

SENTRY
You won’t say that I was drowsing
will you Highness No sooner did I
shut me eyes than I was lifted out of
this wretched world and forgot me
duties

EXT A FIELD BEYOND THE FORT - DAYFOR-NIGRT

Smith leads Pocahontas into a field of leveled ground
beyond the fort The twisted shapes of burnt-out tree
stumps loom up about them in the light of Smith’s hurricane
lantern

SMITH
How do you know

POCAHONTAS
The corn He sees you mean to stay
Do you Do they

Smith does notanswer She is terribly upset about what
she is doing

POCAHONTAS
Make peace with him before he comes
SMITH
Ha wont accept peace He’d ba a fool
to
POCAHONTAS

You’re going to fight a war with him
Sand them away So many will die

SMITH

I won’t do that They wouldn’t listen
to ma avean if I did Why should they
This earth is theirs as much as it’s
yours You own it I know Well I
suppose you could say you’va owned it
long anough Now others are having
their turn

after a pause)
Besides they have no boats to leave
in

She is steadfast in ignoring the drift of what he says

POCAHONTAS
We can go away We can go whera
nobody could find us

SMITH

Whera For how long We can’t live
out in the woods And the truth is I
could never take you to England with
ma either You don’t belong in that
world You’d be like a plaything A
curiosity They make you over there
They make you their own They press
you small like Chinese feat

Smith looks off into the woods All at once it strikes him
how terribly he has compromised her -- and that now he must
take a stand

POCAHONTAS
This isn’t you John Don’t you
ramember

But when she looks at his face she sees that ha remembers
nothing of those other times

SMITH
(shouting)
Watchman How many hours till the
dawn

68
SENTRY (faintly)
Two Captain

Impulsively Smith draws some beads and bells from a pouch
on his belt and offers them to her

SMITH
Here

Bells She looks at him unbelieving He himself seems
horrified at what he is doing

POCAHONTAS
Why do you give ma these
SMITH
You’ve done the English a service
POCAHONTAS
Let me see your face
SMITH
They should be thankful to you You
have extended yourself for them -- now

more than once

POCAHONTAS
(very proud)
I have betrayed my father Nothing
can reward me for that Ifhe saw
me with these he would take my life
Here Take them back

SMITH
I can’t do what you wish

POCAHONTAS
They care nothing for you I can stop
my father Tell them to leave

SMITH
They wouldn’t listen to me

POCAHONTAS
Never until this moment have you
spoken falsely Why have you said
such things to me

SMITH
Truthful pure as you I cannot he

69

POCAHONTAS
I know that you would never deceive
me I ran here through the forest

Now I feel I’ve done somathing very
wrong

(horrified)
Will you warn them

Suddenly he regrets his cruelty He takes her by the hand

SMITH
You have to come with me
POCAHONTAS
Where
SMITH

Into the fort Your people will know
you came They’1ll find out soon
enough

POCAHONTAS
What will you do

SMITH
My sweet my woodland fairy my
saviour why do you fear me Do I now
seem to you dark and evil but too
late for your peace after the sweet
sickness of love has infected you

He reaches out towards her but she wrenches free and
retreats to the edge of the woods stopping now and then to
look over her shoulder in a proud confused way

SMITH
Stay I must not let you go alone
They will punish you

When he starts toward her she turns and runs away

EXT WOODS

Smith follows her She is like some little dog which has
lost its master and does not know whether to run on to run
back -- where to turn He seems on the verge of coaxing
her back when he sees a squad of Indian scouts advancing
through the woods

He hides behind a tree When he looks back she is gone
He has no alternative now He turns back

Meanwhile Pocahontas abandons herself to her grief

EXT FORT - DAWN

Smith walks back into the fort He cannot think clearly
He does not know where his duty lies or whether ha even
cares anymore He wonders what has made him change He

remembers making vows to her but they seem like the words
of a stranger

SENTRY
Captain Is anything wrong Excuse
ma if I worry too much but the ships
should’ve been ‘ere weeks ago and now
the men are talking -- ‘ave they
forgot about us

Smith stares at him a long time before speaking Shall he
obey the voice that in the forest commanded him Shall he
live in this world or that other

SMITH
Wake the men up Silently Have them
report here Don’t stand there Go

INT SMITH’S TENT

Smith throws himself on his straw bed For a moment’s
passion he has cut her life to ribbons perhaps sent her
off to her death What would it mean going to her now
It would be madness

Then the memory of the poor bewildered figure of those
anxious eyes digs into him again In a seizure of
longing the kind that comes upon one when life seems to he
carrying something out of reach he leaps up He wants her
again her kisses her soft body her abandonment all her
warm pagan emotion wants the wonderful feeling of that
night under the sighing pines wants it all with a horrible
intensity

EXT FORT
Smith walks out toward the woods beyond the fort

SENTRY
Captain The men are ready

What is it that struggles against pity and this feverish
longing and keeps him rooted here He turns back He will
think about it later

EXT WOODS NEAR FORT - SUNRISE

As the sun rises through the cool blue canyons of the
pines Pocahontas wanders along in a daze

72

Under the generaiship of Opechancanough the Indians mova

quickly through the woods until they have surrounded the
ort

A scout slips up through the wet marsh grass to the
palisade At his signal the Indian soldiers advance
brandishing their spears and war clubs

The English have been waiting for this moment They roll
out their cannons and send a sickle of grapeshot through
the Indians’ front ranks

Astonished the Indians fall back but the second and third
waves press blindly on Before the English can reload
they are upon the walls They fight with a blind
determination but their light weapons are no match for
English steel They retreat back into the field where
again they are beset by the cannons Yet still they rally
and make a second charge Fresh troops constantly replace
those who have retired In the same way that the English
pass orders by trumpets and drums the Indians use heralds
to cry out when to attack and when to retreat

When an Englishman falls the Indians stuff arrows up his
rectum and hack him to pieces lopping off heads and hands
and private parts waving the trophies aloft laughing

Musketeers advance into the field each protected by a
Pikesman They rest their heavy weapons on a stand then
light off their hundred-caliber loads in a great cloud of
smoke

Opechancanough is puzzled How could the enemy have known
ef the attack as clearly they did

The Indians shout curses and accusations of betrayal at
Smith in Algonguin He does not reply His comrades look
to him for an explanation

With his sword and bullwhip Smith ranges out beyond the
fort to engage in single combat Tears stream down his
face His eyes are crazy and ferocious He shrugs off his
wounds He proves himself the bravest of the English a
law unto himself

Powhatan sick at heart watches the progress of the battle
from a cliff half a mile from the fort Things do not go
well for the Indians they are used to fighting in ambushes
and skirmishes not pitched battles Still they vastly
outnumber the English and hope to wear them down

EXT INDIAN DRESSING STATION - POCAHONTAS

Pocahontas watches the Indian wounded being taken to the
rear They bear their sufferings in silence

She wanders about in a turmoil of shame and bewilderment
She cannot go back to her father -- what should sha do
How many yet will die on her account

Her cousins and hrothers look questioningly at her knowin
she likes the English but hardly guessing the full extent g
of what they would consider her treachery

Suddenly she sees her brother Parahunt among the wounded

A piece of shrapnel has torn through his belly he will not
survive

PARAHUNT
Something stung me then I couldn’t
walk Now I can’t move my shoulder
sister I’m cold Cold

POCAHONTAS
Here rest Help him

PARAHUNT
Sit down Talk to me There’s
nothing you can do

POCAHONTAS
Don’t say that Wait Help him

She runs off to look for help but she does not get far
Two Indians seize her on order from the Emperor They
ignore her protests -- that her brother is dying that her
father will punish them when he finds out how they have
treated her

EXT JAMESTOWN FORT

The attack seems to have abated though a few Pamunkey
braves steal into the fortress through chinks in the wall
and tunnels they have dug They fight blindly with knives
and tomahawks until they are contained and killed

Lookouts search the horizon Smith knocks tham from their
parch

SMITH
What are you looking for There’s no
one coming to rescue you

Flecked with blood he walks through the stockade sneering
at his soldiers

BEN
You seem pretty ‘appy

SMITH
Nothing intoxicates me like disaster
My past mistakes seem very small

A wounded man pulls an arrow from his hand and waves it
hysterically at Smith

WOUNDED MAN

T’m not entirely sure I shall have the
use of this hand again I liked it
while IT had it You see I was a
clerk when I left London I never
thought I’d have any trouble with it
Don’t walk off What was they
shouting at you

(Smith turns around)
You heard me Don’t give ma that
poxey look What did you do to them
What did you do to gat them so oggly
about us Why ‘ave I got to pay for
it

(Smith does not answer)
He’s not telling us something and I
got a right to know They won’t
respect our white flag Thay won’t
receive our emissaries There’s
something he’s not telling us

SMITH
Stupid as hogs the lot of you

SECOND MAN
Now we’re fighting with each other
When the anemy’s out there preparing
to aut our throats

Smith strides around bristling with contempt

SMITH
Stupid as hogs
(under his breath)
Always shut up somewhere

Wobblehead who knows no sides gives Smith an apologetic
look It is not in his nature to be sad for long however
He leaps in the air and runs off through the lanes hooting
maniacally

INT SMITH’S TENT

Smith sulks in his tent like Achilles Has he betrayed her
from a fear of his peers’ opinions he who prides himself
on bending to no man What need has he to justify himself
to the likes of them

A man with his fine sense of honor cannot forgive himself

for acts that lesser man might consider trivial Ben
enters

BEN
You must be more diplomatic

SMITH
What have I got to say I can’t bring
my tongue to say it What should I
do Show them my wounds and tell them
how I got them in their service while
they ran from tha noise of their own
drums Hang ‘em I’d rather die than
crave their favor

BEN
They say you mock them When our
patrols returned unharmed you
expressed your regret You call ‘em
enemies of true nobility

SMITH
Yes

BEN
Why do you want to lead them

SMITH
I deserve to -

BEN
You have no desire to

SMITH
I have no desire to trouble the poor
with begging Maybe you can give me a
bex on the ear so I may look penitent

BEN
Take care they don’t plant a deep
enough rage in you they make you one
of their own

Smith walks outside The Indians have broken off their
attack

EXT RIVER

Stripped to his underwear Smith plunges into the river
The puzzled looks of the English give him an odd pleasure
He swims farther and farther out defying the danger of the
fast current and the hostile Indians on the other bank

To go back and love Pocahontas in the woods with
everything around wild and fitting -- that he knows is
impossible To transplant her to a great town to keep in
some little room one who belongs so wholly to nature -- he
shrinks from this In London her very simplicity her lack
of all sophistication would make her life a misery of
exile and alienation But now that she is gone he hates
himsel£ and the English with their smug ideas of right and
uty

An ache for lost youth a hankering a sense of wasted love
and sweetness grips him by the throat Surely on this
earth of such wild beauty one is meant to hold rapture to
one’s heart as the earth and sky hold it And yet it seems
that one cannot or not for long

What did he do that was wrong Where is that new world in
which he found such happiness Those woods with their sky-
loving pines

EXT POWHATAN’S CAMPAIGN TENT

Pocahontas is conducted to Powhatan’s campaign tent by an
official of the court She takes a moment to compose
herself before she enters Shae knows her father is aware
of her offense

INT TENT

Pocahontas sits before Powhatan in the hazy darkness of the
tent The Emperor is thickly painted and oiled all over --
his arms and shoulders red his face blue his body jat

black From his ears hang the dried claws of a kingfisher

POWHATAN

Youve brought me great sadness You
could have married other chiefs and
worked for your nation You could
have helped to bring us peace You
have forgotten your duty

(pause)
So have I I loved you more than my
people I put you my heart and soul
ahead of them I did that thing which
I forbada you to You have been a
fool but I have been a very great
fool These peopla coma to take our
world away We must defend ourselves
against them Many more will die
because of our folly I shall tell
nobody of this Not because I love
you but because I am weak

Ne

103B

From outside come the noises of new preparations for
battle

POWHATAN
I can no longer speak with my
ancestors nor with my people
Someday if I have any honor I shall
tell them what I have done and offer
them my life Today I cannot

POCAHONTAS
Forgive me father

POWHATAN
You have been the light of my life I
cannot giva you over to die I banish
you instead -- I take your name away
and send you to your uncle I am too
old to see you die but if I see you
again I might feel the love of you
again You are already dead I
cannot love one that is dead I
cannot love a ghost So leave me now
ghost girl and may the Father of our
people give you happiness in the
hereafter

Pocahontas stands up He sits with his head bowed
Despairing of a further word from him she leaves

EXT CEREMONIAL FUNERAL

The Indians hold a ceremonial funeral for Pocahontas at a
pavilion near the battlefield Once the joy of her
people’s eyes they will no longer look at her except in
their mirrors They behave as though they genuinely
believed she were gone - a ghost

Still the ritual is one to bafit a princess Heralds play
dirges on trumpets of tree bark Eight strong braves bear
the palanquin that will carry her off to exile Two
hermaphrodites walk ahead with fans at the ands of long
poles to protect her from the sun

EXT WOODS

An English scout sees Pocahontas’ train moving through the
woods He recognizes her

EXT WOODS - SMITH AND TOMOCOMO - NIGHT

Tomocomo has come to Smith as a spokesman for Powhatan his
emperor They are alone in the moonlit woods

TOMOCOMO
The great Powhatan speaks thus “You
destroyer of peace a man I saved and
sheltered and fed -- treated like a
son -- have you not injured ma
enough You have stolen my child’s
heart from me With a thousand
inventions you have driven her mad
With your lying tongue you have
changed her into a demon to persecute
me” I was to say no more but see -

Catching hold of the top of a sapling he bands it to the
ground

TOMOCOMO
We shall treat you in the same way

He turns and leaves
EXT VICINITY OF THE FORT - DAWN

At dawn the Indians resume their attack They twist moss
around the points of their arrows sat them alight and
shoot them ovar the walls of the fort onto the thatch roofs
of the English houses which burst into flame

The English rush around trying to put out the fires Their
situation grows more desperate from hour to hour A soot-
blackened soldier reports toa Smith

SOLDIER
The east wall is burned through sir
Wa cannot close it without exposing
ourselves to their missiles

Argall leads in the scout who spotted Pocahontas in the
woods

ARGALL
Tell him

“ SCOUT
The Princess is up the river at
Pastancy They sent her to her uncle

Patowomeck Lord of the Naked Devils
of that region and by the by an
acquaintance of mine So I gat to
talking to his Nibs and he proposes to
sell her He says with her at the
fort the Emperor will not dare attack
us He dotes on her

SMITH
You’re certain she’s the one you saw
Scout
With these eyes I spoke to the King
directly
SMITH

And what does this rogue propose to
sell her for

SCOUT
I was getting to that His most
favorite thing is combs but in this
case he appears to have his heart set
on a kettle A hob you know -- a
copper kettle like me mother uses for
making tea What use he means to make
of the instrument I cannot say

ARGALL
Well

SMITH
We don’t take hostages King James
would not approve

ARGALL
You would rather see us annihilated

It is the first diract challenge to his authority that
Smith has faced

SMITH
She has done enough for us she
risked the beating out of her own
brains to save mine She kept the
rest of you from starving We shall
not answer her kindness by making her
a captive

Argall presses Smith confident the others are on his side
that they will see this as their last hope

ARGALL

She and her flock are on the verge of
killing us all I expect there will
scarce be a handful alive when the
boats return if they ever do You
told us yourself that her father
regards her as no one else

(Smith says nothing)
Do you have private reasons for this
attitude of yours

BO

SMITH
Return to your post

Smiths behavior feeds the flame of Argall’s suspicions
He stands his ground

SMITH
The penalty for disobeying an order of
the President is hanging You’re
breaking the laws This is mutiny

ARGALL

Me breaking the laws Youve broke
them all yerself as fast as you made
them

(to the men)
I have information Smith here was
Planning te marry the wench and make
himself King of Virginia I have the
proof The crazy one told ma Listan
to what he says

Fearing their wrath Wobblehead retreats into the shadows
Smith strides up to Argall until they area face to face
His eyes blaze with anger

ARGALL
Strike me and you break the laws of
this colony Those are the laws
You’ve got to protect thease men

SMITH
Strike you

He looks at him for a moment than reaches out and gives
his ear a violent twist

ARGALL
Jesu

Suddenly six of Argall’s cohorts fall on smith from behind
and wrestle him to the ground

ARGALL
(triumphantly)

Youre no longer in command Smithy
I shall have the medal now You have
been derelict in your duties to the
King You’ve betrayed the citizens of
Jamestown The medal please You’ve
shamed the investors of the London
Company I therefore pronounce you
unworthy of being a member of this
colony

ARGALL (contd)
As Chief Spokesman for His Majesty in
the New World I sentence you to
corporal punishment until you admit
your guilt

SMITH AND SOLDIERS

Smith is conducted to the docks by a brace of guilty
soldiers Among them is the sentry who greeted Pocahontas

the morning of the first attack He has reason to feel
quiltiest of all

SENTRY
Sorry Captain We must do as Argall
Says We men ‘ave got no power

SECOND MAN
I advise you to admit your fault
Otherwise he will kill you He can’t
afford to be considered a mutineer
without legal authority

EXT SHALLOP - INC UNDERWATER SHOT

Smith is keelhauled -- dragged by a rope beneath the ship
so that his back is raked along the jagged barnacles

encrusted on the hull He bobs to the surface gasping for
breath

ARGALL
You want to say your piece No Very
well I sentence you to hard labor at
the brickworks

EXT JAMESTOWN DOCK

Argall and a party of ten soldiers sail the shallop upriver
to kidnap Pocahontas

EXT PASTANCY INDIAN CAMP

PATOWOMECK the traacherous King of Pastancy watches out
of tha side of his eye as an English sailor sets a copper
kettle down in front of his lodge He must be careful not
to appear complicitous with the kidnapping

ARGALL
No use trying to hide her I know she
is here Help me and I will be your
friend

Patowomeck’s ayes flit nervously around Argall bows to
Pocahontas who is surprised that he seems to know who she
is

a2

POCAHONTAS
Who sant the boat

ARGALL
Why nobody sent it milady I was
just passing by when I thought it
diplomatic to stop and pay a visit

POCAHONTAS
You don’t seem like someone to trouble
himself about diplomacy

ARGALL
(slyly)
Does Captain Smith

POCAHONTAS
I could not say I am sure he does
not tolerate insolence from his
subordinates

Two Moons a sympathetic Pastancy Indian appears beside
Pocahontas and bows to her They are out of Argall’s
hearing

TWO MOONS
Princess they mean to get you on
board and kidnap you

POCAHONTAS
What makes you say that

But there are tears in her eyes She knows full well what
is going on

THO MOONS
I saw your uncle dealing with the
Tassantasse They’re planning to taka
you back to their camp Watch out

POCAHONTAS
Nonsense

Pocahontas looks at the shallop its mast wobbling back and
forth in the lazy current of the Chesapeake Could Smith
really have sent it Could this be a grand gesture from
her lover The music hints at such a-hope Should she
swallow her pride batray her father yet again and give
Smith another chance She cares nothing for her dignity
anymore She is ruined What is left to save - except
if possible a last glance at one who once loved her

Patowomeck’s wife approaches Her guile is heart-
wrenchingly transparent

PATOWOMECK’S WIFE

Please come I am afraid to go all by
myself My husband told ma I could go
only if you go with me

POCAHONTAS
You think it will be safe

PATOWOMECK’S WIFE
Of course You live in our house We
take care of you

Pocahontas smiles pleasantly
EXT GANGPLANK TO SHALLOP

PATOWOMECK’S WIFE
You go first

Pocahontas walks up the gangplank ahead of the wife

POCAHONTAS
You see

All at once the English seize her pull the gangplank
aboard and shove off A display of their muskets is enough
to discourage the Indians from retaliating though a few
throw rocks and spears Pocahontas feels a rudeness in
Argalls grasp that tells her she is not being brought to
damestown as a guest of the President’s Now she starts to
struggle in earnest

ARGALL
You won’t be hurt Highness

POCAHONTAS
You wouldn’t dare

On the shore Patowomeck rushes about giving contradictory
orders never letting go of his kettle bristling with
indignation yelling words of ancouragement to Pocahontas
and knocking his wife about The English soldiers laugh
no longer able to keep up their end of the charade
Pocahontas covers har face with her hands She burns with
shame

EXT JAMES RIVER

As the shallop drifts along the river the English raiders
study their captive sympathetically They know they owe
their lives to her and that they have caused her to suffer
terribly in return Argall comes up beside her and drapes
a shawl over her bare shoulders

POCAHONTAS
My father will not ransom ma He does
not feel toward me as he did before
I tell you this so you do not risk the
lives of your man further than you
already have

ARGALL

One must hope Your Majesty I
apologize for this discommoding of
your person Such are the necessities
of war

(philosophically)
I came out here because I had nowhere
else to go They took away my land
though I owned it outright and had
papers to prove it My father told me
honor wasn’t going to help me gat it
back And it doesn’t help you in the
grave He was wrong about all else
but right about that

me

EXT JAMESTOWN DOCK

Disembarking at the Jamestown docks Pocahontas is dismayed

to find that Smith is not on hand

POCAHONTAS
Where is the President

The English knowing that their fate may depend upon her

treat her with great deference

ARGALL
President Yes -- I neglected to tell
you The Captain’s no longer
occupying that post He can explain
the reasons better than I You will
only be kept here long enough for us
to arrange a truce In the meanwhile

INT REVEREND WHITAKER’S HOUSE - MONTAGE

Pocahontas enters the Reverend Whitaker’s clapboard house

the single frame dwelling in the colony Her guards take
up their posts outside Slats have been nailed across the
windows

She looks distractedly at the English appurtenances -- the
oil lamps the white pine furniture and the porcelain
figures on the mantel MARY Whitaker’s maid a middle-
aged woman from Devon appears to greet the royal guest
Great care hag been taken to ensure that she will be
comfortable

MARY
This will be your room milady

Pocahontas acts as though she did not hear her

ARGALL
She says that’s not her name anymore
She has no name

MARY
How unfortunate Well we shall have
to give you one PerhapsLady --
you are of royal blood -- Rebecca My
mother’s name was Rebecca Would that
be suitable Does she like it You
may leave us Captain

Argall leaves Beneath a single window there is a bed of
rough planks covered with a pallet of straw Pocahontas’
guards stroll back and forth outside Mary can plainly see
that she is utterly distraught and crazed with grief

MARY
This is the basin for when you want
to wash The water is outside the
window in the rain barrel

She demonstrates the use of the wash basin

MARY
This is soap

She shows Pocahontas by pantomime how the soap is used
There is not a trace of pleading or complaint in her guest
She appears determined to face each new hardship with
courage

MARY
I think you are most elegant excusing
the liberty ‘

8S

Mary tries to get her to eat but she will not take food

Mary gives her a bath She is limp and indifferent even as
a pail of hot water is poured over her shoulders Sha is
like a wild animal that has been brought into captivity

She puts on Marys cast-off clothes First a corset then
a tattered camisole then a long calico gown

Mary makes her look at herself in the mirror She is

beautiful yet Mary’s cries of admiration do not cause her
to feel less forlorn

Mary shows her how to sit and walk like an Englishwoman
She must keep her back straight and her knees together
smoothe out her skirt etc Outside a new battle rages

MARY
Go ahead Takea few steps Walk
That’s right The shoes hurt your
feet don’t they

Pocahontas’ movements naturally free seem constrained in
these new garments They weigh on her like papal
vestments But she continues to accept Marys efforts to
teach her English ways with a fierce stoicism If this is
to be the form of her damnation she will throw herself
into it head first She will relish her perdition

EXT JAMESTOWN FORT - BATTLE - POV ON ENGLISH SHIPS

The Indians pelt the fort with flaming arrows as the
English their defenses crumbling and their walls on the
verge of being wholly breached wait to see if Pocahontas
will ransom them

Then all at once they leave off their attack and we
stand with Powhatan as they behold with astonished eyes the
return of Nawport and the English ships

POCAHONTAS AND MARY

Mary shows Pocahontas how to use a door key It seems to
her that the Princess’ mind has been damaged

MARY
Not that way Hold it like this
(abruptly)
Will you see Captain Smith

Pocahontas does not reply Pity for Smith’s approaching
sufferings at her hands surges up inside her together with
a smaller measure of pity for herself Outside they hear
loud boisterous noises

EXT WHITAKER HOME

Mary rushes out to sea what is going on Pocahontas
lingers inside her heart pounding with expectation
Cannons thump in the distance English soldiers rush
through the streets celebrating wildly

MARY
What is it

PASSERBY
The ships ‘ave come The war’s over
The Chief of the Savages has offered
us peace

NEW ANGLE
Pocahontas chops her hair off with a broken conch shell
EXT WHITAKER BACK DOOR

With her guards distracted by the festivities she sneaks
out the back way She wanders around for a while as she
considers whether she should swallow down her pride and go
to Smith She looks at the back woods considers going
back to her own people then thinks better of it

EXT BRICKWORKS

She finds Smith at the stockade hard at work making
bricks He looks around and sees her standing before him
dressed in English clothes

POCAHONTAS
Did you know I was here

SMITH
They said they were going to fetch
you I was against it

POCAHONTAS
Oh

Her cheeks burn with shame and disappointment But this
it seems is what she wants -- to feel humiliated to the
point of drastic action Smith starts to speak but
hesitates

POCAHONTAS
What

SMITH
I forgot what I was going to say

a7

POCAHONTAS

Tt must have bean a lie Wait - let
ma look at you

(distraught)
I should not have come to you

(her eyes plead with him)
You hear them singing dancing Turn
Close your eyes

She draws a long kitchen knife out from under her shawl and
brings it down with all her strength against Smith’s heart
The steel corselet beneath his shirt causes it to ricochet
away and Pocahontas cuts her hand on the blade She drops
the knife and bursts into tears Smith takes a moment to
compose himself then reaches out to touch her

POCAHONTAS
No

SMITH
It was your own choice Was it not
Blama no one but yourself You
followed me of your own free will
Did I come looking for you Did I
lure you from your family’s side Did
I force my love on you

POCAHONTAS
I deceived my father left my home --
where can I go now Back to the
people I betrayed They hate me As
they should I had no cause to harm
them

SMITH
Did I hand you over to thesa people or
urge you to do any of those things you
think so evil

POCAHONTAS
It pains me to hear you lie
-’ SMITH
I didn’t want to harm you -- and now

there’s disaster all around us We
should have stopped before it was too
late How can I go off with you
Where Where would you belong
Barefoot Tattoos Running through
the trees talking to the clouds

He decides to leave it there then breaks his resolution
SMITH
You’re surprised that I don’t have
scruples Well I do but it’s not in
my character to be stopped by them fr
want no more chaos I want peace

POCAHONTAS

You will not have it

(after a pause)
Let me stay with you You will never
be happy anyway It can’t matter to
you one way or the other

(seeing him hesitate)
I will never question you in anything
I will be like a bird in your hand

(still he hesitates)
When you first came to our camp you
made me feel - that we had always
been looking for each other You
taught me how to name the stars You
showed me where the north was Then I
loved you and showed you all the good
things of the land Do you remember

The springs the turkeys’ nests the

places where the fish hide

SMITH

And I expressed my appreciation

(qrowing angry)
You might consider that in return for
saving me you might have got more
than you gave You left a barbarous
placa to come to a civilized colony
Don’t make me talk this way

But he cannot resist going on

SMITH

I taught you how to speak When you
were a savage and didn’t know your own
meaning but whistled like a bird May
the gods blast me You think I thank
you for the things you’ve done No --
I thank whatever foul fiendish thing
makes people fall in love

(maniacally)
Lovet I hate the name There’s no
irons can make you more of a slave
You forget yourself Your dignity
your freedom You end up wondering
what drove you mad I was happier in
a Turkish jail

POCAHONTAS
Ioam sorry I hava no right to blama
you Don’t leave this way I don’t
want to remember you this way --
thinking what to tell ma - how to say
it Show a doubt Pretend if you
have to You have a good heart

Smith sees the guilelessness of her clear eyes and feals
his feet meshed in a web of lias He seas the damage he
has done her this child whose heart has never known true
Qrief A dam bursts inside him Trembling with emotion
he rips open her blouse

SMITH
Here let me see you naked One last
time So I can forget you

He pushes her back into the darkness of a stable His face
is contorted beyond recognition A demon rages inside him

POCAHONTAS
I watched my brother die I killed
him I know that I am vile I lied
I stole You cannot endure me
anymore That night when I asked you
to take me away -- you hated me then
I hate myself a thousand times more
I could rip my heart from my chest
What is it doing there

SMITH
You hate me I dont blame you for
it

He offers her the knife she stabbed him with Pocahontas
looks at him stunned When sha next speaks she seems
utterly changed

POCAHONTAS
Oh John is this a dream I never
knew that life could be this way I
did not know what you call misfortune
I thought all was the best that it

could be -- that men loved the truth --
that people didn’t go away when they
died not forever -- that they were

hera listening and kept the snakes
away I thought you could talk with a
stone I was a foolish girl I
thought we wanted the same thing --
that we might have a child and -

While she has been talking Smith has quietly come up behind
her Now suddenly she turns around and sees him He
takes her into his arms

SMITH
I have injured you and my own soul
Those wounds that I have given you I
hope in time shall heal Those wounds
I gave myself they never can

POCAHONTAS
I forgive you John

SMITH
Forgive me 1 who loved you was
crueller to you than your cruellest

enemies I’ve casta shadow on your
life
Immitigable eternal He sees it even if she does not

Heaven itself could not undo what he has done

He rocks her gently back and forth and she pulls him down

to the ground beside her and they hold one another as they
did long ago in the dark Chickahominy woods

EXT JAMESTOWN DOCK

Do you wish to bring charges against

Are you sure Fine then Argall Be
off

I have news for you

NEWPORT (cont’d)
The King wants you to return to
England and prepare an expedition of
your own to chart the northern coasts
- to sea if you might find a passage
to the Indies

Smith ponders the offer

SMITH
Thank you but I am obliged to
decline

NEWPORT

May I know why

(no reply)
Come Smith this is not how the world
works Eh This is not how things
are done Things must look different
to you here than from out there in the
woods The King has great hopes for
you Plans great plans I spoke
with him in person What is there for
you if you stay Trouble Ennui
The common lot But I will not plead
with you Your life is your own Is
there anything I can do for you

SMITH
She will not escape

NEWPORT
No not if she has her senses about
her Her father does not want her
back He would be obliged to take her
life if she returned Yes they would
kill her if she did She understands
that

The colony is plunged into a faver of activity under
Newport’s direction He addrasses its assembled members

NEWPORT
Unless the material sickness that has
consumed the spirit of our colony is
branded and checked unless our lusts
are outgrown and our rape of this
earth and of each other stopped wa
shall lose not only our life and land
but “like Esau of old our eternal
birthright Let not America go wrong
in her first hour If we use God’s
bounty for selfish purposes then God
will curse us

(MORE)

NEWPORT (cont’d)
Let us remember what this country was
when first we set foot upon these
shores Let us think what it still
might be Let us prepare a land of
justice and liberty where a man might
rise to his true stature a land of
unprecedented faith tolerating all
founded on the soul and loving its
laws a land that shall be the scene
of the next mighty act in the history
of man’s redemption

Over the course of the following weeks Pocahontas and
Smith manage to steal a few hours together They skip
stones and feed each other berries She shows him a bird
she has coaxed to land on her hand He caresses her
shoulders with a cattail and looks at her tattoos
Embarrassed she covers them back up She has grown more
modest She fears that she might seem like a barbarian to
him

Her wild natural gaiety is gone out of her The
somersaulting is but an imitation She no longer is the
blithe fantastic being he met in the forest bright as an
angel innocent and affectionate as a child What has he
done From a distance Wilf regards him warily

SMITH
You look sad Have I made you so

POCAHONTAS
Sad Wo I’ve never been sad We
have all we need Even now Why
should I be sad

SMITH AND NEWPORT

Newport and Smith are out for a walk In the background
there is the incessant note of frogs

NEWPORT
I always thought you were meant for
something more Smith

SMITH
More what

NEWPORT
I doent know Important

SMITH
More important to whom

NEWPORT

You could do your nation a great
service All nations His Majesty is
ready to finance a considerabla
expedition Needless to say it will
be a very famous man who finds it --
the passage -- a way through I know
you do not care about such worldly
things Prastige But still you
might have a great futura ahead of
you Why should it stop here This
is a beautiful land It flows with
milk and honey as surely as any
Scripture ever promised And yet it
is not all we hoped to find now is
it

(music enters
Shall you be a discoverer of passages
which you refused yourself to explore
-- beyond the threshold

Smith looks off down the shore to the place where they
first landed now quite changed

EXT DOCK - INDIES MUSIC

Smith walks through the colony Across the bay he seas the
ships being outfitted for their return to England The new
arrivals salute him His reputation has spread

He stops in front of the largest of the ships He looks up
at the taut spars and ropes at the great waxed sails and
somewhere deep in his soul he again hears the Indies music
that has called to him from the beginning and drawn him
ever on

The music whispers that there is no lasting haven of
happiness Life has moments of unbidden flying rapture
but they last no longer than it takes a cloud to move
across the sun They are as fleeting as the golden visions
one has of the soul in nature those glimpses of its remote
and brooding sanity

It whispers that the Indies lie always before us
everything is still possible we can put tragedy behind us
and make a new start And now we no longer see Smith
directly but seam to look out over his shoulder We notice
what he notices -- the sailors coming and going the
chatter of the new pioneers the wind playing in the sails

EXT JAMES RIVER SHORE

Smith talks with Ben his sole confidant

Hedged by a margin of dark trees the river winds off into
the interior shimmering in the evening light

SMITH

A man cannot let himself be detained
on Calypso islands however inviting
He must sail on - put off those arms
which would hold him and keep the
independence of the open sea Heaven
will not fault him Heaven itself is
shoreless Better to perish in the
howling infinite than crawl to the
safety of the land Unless you are
ready with a savage will to break
free you stand to miss your own
destiny What is worse than that To
wake up and find you’ve been leading
another man’s life

(Ben does not reply)
Wait two months then tell her I am
dead

(seeing Ben hesitate)
It will give her strength She must
not despair of her future

No one has followed us

POCAHONTAS

SMITH
We can’t go farther We might get
lost Tell me my sweet are you well
today

She wonders why he seems so solemn The afternoon is
lovely and it is not easy for them to steal away

SMITH
There’s something I know when Im
with you
She gazes at him What does he mean

SMITH
I’ve been a monster to you
POCAHONTAS
What is that

SMITH

Someone who doesn’t care if he hurts
other people

She does not answer but looks at him in silence Whatever
the past has been let them think rather of what lies
ahead Far away the ships sway gently at their anchor

SMITH
You know ma as I was long ago when
the soul that looked from my eyes was
not the accursed thing that it is now
Yet sometimes it seems -- I could be
something still -- I’ve never yet been
the man you thought I was or had the
right to expect that I should be

POCAHONTAS
shaking her head)
You’re all I’ve ever wanted Just as
you are

SMITH
Tell me my sweet do you still wonder
if the wind could blow backwards

She smiles How lovable she is in her devotion how
childlike Hear look of adoration could move a stone It
is a fearfully painful thing to love her as he does and
to have to be so cruel though her stoicism makes it
somewhat easier for him to discount what she might feel

POCAHONTAS
Why do you bite your lip
he doas not answer)
Why do you look at me that way

SMITH
I cannot tell One imagines that one
is strong when one is weak

POCAHONTAS
You are very strong Why worry about
the rain when it is past We waste
the afternoon Come away Let’s sit
by the river and think of all the
birds- we can

SMITH
Yes

POCAHONTAS
O John how happy wa can be We fit
Love will make us happy in spite of
the sadness we have known Why mourn
for what is lost Why do we not
quickly forget it till we are glad
again

He looks at her with a sharp stab of longing He loves her
now in leaving her more than ever before

frolicsome in the morning sun Tha waves lift up their
necks pressing toward the deep-water currents The mast
points toward the clouds High above flies a solitary

POCAHONTAS ASLEEP

Nature breathes softly about Pocahontas as she lies beneath
a tree a nymph lost in her green dreams an Ariadne
Gradually she comes to consciousness Wobblehead is
tickling her lip with a spear of grass Startled she asks

that her friend Smith may be giving her the slip

EXT JAMESTOWN STREETS

Pocahontas walks briskly through the streets of Jamestown
They are mysteriously deserted Then she hears the noise

Pocahontas serves tea to a group of newly-arrived women
She wears a glazed expression and seems utterly indifferent
to their gaze”-As soon as she leaves the room they begin
to talk about her

The other day she stripped off her
clothes on the landing in front of
the Plowman family When they gasped
she turned and threatened to scalp
them

They are unaware that the creature who is serving them once

At night by a candle she resumes their communion A moth
flits about the flame The windows buzz in their fittings
Her eyas dart right and left waiting for Smith’s spirit to
make an appearance Love and rage sweep over her in waves
Why can she not live like the simple moth

POCAHONTAS (0S)

I want to do good yet I do bad You
told me that if I loved truly I would
find true love in turn I followed my
heart now I am lost I thought there
were no accidents that every sorrow
would turn to joy and all at last to
blessing O©O Mother why did you not
tell me more

136 POCAHONTAS BY MOONLIGHT

the thought of her fate The sight of the sky which once
delighted her now makes her heartsick and ashamed

EXT RIVERBANK

Pocahontas makes her way across a wet meadow into the
darkness of the forest She picks a toadstool a red
amanita and eats it then lies down on a carpet of pine
needles to await her death

Luckily Wobblehead has been following her He rushes out
picks her up in his arms shakes her then carries her off
to the river to drench her and to seek an antidote

EXT JAMESTOWN STREET - MONTAGE AUTUMN

Autumn leaves are falling Pocahontas walks around dressed

in rags and tatters Her hair which once shone like a
raven’s wing now hangs down in matted tresses She does
not care how she looks She has given up her attempts at
looking like a civilized woman Her reason for them just
sailed away She is dirty distraught She can barely be
made to utter a word She is like a wild creature that
will not take to captivity She makes no secret of her
loss When she does grow animated it is to take a
perverse delight in degrading herself before the citizens
of Jamestown -- dancing and chanting behaving in
unpredictable and outrageous ways

She watches the scavenger dogs slink through the alleys and
feels a special affinity with them -- with all things low
and revolting all things scorned and abused

She sees the Indians trading with the white men The sight
of the simple carefree life that she forever has
relinquished fills her with an indescribable dismay

POCAHONTAS IN THE RAIN

Rolfe watches her as she walks in the rain She looks up

at the sky with a smile and closes her eyes enjoying the

gentle pelting of the raindrops while the English hurry by
covering their heads She dances

He sees in her a glimmer of the natural girl whom we first
met wounded now though still quite young Mustering his
courage he steps out into her path

ROLFE

I would lika to spend the afternoon
with you How do I ask

POCAHONTAS
(aloof)
You just did

Sha makes no effort to drive him away nor to carry the
conversation further

EXT PATH THROUGH THE WOODS

Pocahontas and Rolfe are on a path through the woods The
sight of her so beautiful and so deeply wounded stirs
Rolfe to the quick

ROLFE
What are you going to do You can’t
let yourself rot away

‘POCAHONTAS
What do you mean

ROLFE
You seem like someone who loves her
freedom -- who could never be caught
Caught you know like a bird ina
cage

POCAHONTAS

I don’t know why you call it that If
I like my cage why need it trouble
you

Two little girls rush up and beg her breathlessly not to
leave otherwise they will be sent back to England
Pocahontas promises them that with new friends like these
she would not consider it She and Rolfe continue on their
walk

POCAHONTAS
You love people and they don’t love
you back You tell them the truth
and they tell you lies I don’t know
why I am surprised I couldn’t make
him love ma I couldn’t make him
sorry when he wasn’t with me Don’t
remind me that I ever spoke this way
I wouldn’t like to remember it

But she finds it impossible to stem the flood that is
rising in her

POCAHONTAS

I can’t abide myself 1 lived for
him All day long I waited for him
like a dog I obeyed him smiled at
him put on things to please him then
took them off if I thought they
wouldn’t

(Rolfe seems to wince)
And all the time he didn’t want me I
can’t bear it And I deserve it all
I thought only of myself -- while my
family suffered while my brother
died

Rolfe looks around wondering if they can be overheard

POCAHONTAS
I will tear him from me tear my chest
down to the bone until the shame is
gone Until I tear it out

She has been feeling strong Now suddenly she feels very
weak

POCAHONTAS
Oh Mr Rolfe if I cry you’1ll put
your hand over my mouth won’t you --
and hold me tight Hold me Mr
‘Rolfe Hold me with all your
strength

Rolfe rocks her gently in his arms

as though to calm her grief

EXT TUNDRA (NEWFOUNDLAND) - WIND A CREAKING MAST

‘Smith’s shadow advances over the ground Searching and

seeking are written in his face with eternal failure to
find His travels bring him at last to the bleak
windswept tundra of Newfoundland There is not a tree in
sight no murmuring stream or leaf to speak with his soul
The natives here (Inuit or Eskimos) gaze at him coldly
with eyes like-stones as though he were a man who could
not be trusted or reckoned with The bribe of gaudy beads
he holds out to them they turn their backs on and he casts
it aside as something worthless after all into the stiff
dead grass

JAMESTOWN GROWS - MONTAGE

A legend reads “Four Years Later” The colony has
prospered its peace with Powhatan assured by Pocahontas’
presence at the fort New arrivals come in from England
every few weeks They fell the forests and lay out their
fields The houses more and more resemble the Tudor
cottages of England Rolfe writes in his journal a
portion of which plays over these scenes

ROLFE (0S)
“In time her spirits improved She
came to believe there must be a reason
for all that had come to pass Things
do not happen by accident She would
go wherever life should lead her She
would not languish in sorrow The
sun the grass and the stars -- they
all were perfect and content Why
should she not be the same Her
transformation was remarkable a great
satisfaction to all who knew and cared
about her”

Rolfe gives Pocahontas books from his library She learns
to read and to speak properly Sha studies geography
history and literature She flourishes under his tutelage
Mary has joined the household as a serving maid

AMBUSH POWHATAN MOVES OUT VILLAGE ON FIRE

The colonists skirmish with the Indians until Powhatan
defenseless against thair superior arms decides to abandon
the Tidewater and push west by canoe and caravan into the
territory of enemy tribes The longhouses are bundled up
the stores unearthed and sealed in clay pots the villages
burned to the ground

Pocahontas sees in the distance the black columns of
smoke She stands and wonders how much more destruction
she will witness Tears rise up behind her eyes

TIGHT ON POWHATAN

Ris face set like a flint Powhatan bids farewell to his
ancestral home

EXT HENRICO TOBACCO FIELDS - ROLFE - PANTOMIME

Rolfe cultivates his extensive tobacco fields Pocahontas
gives him valuable advice showing him (in pantomime) how
to nip off the seed buds so as to concentrate nourishment
in the leaves how properly to fallow the land planting
beans at the foot of the corn so they can climb up the
stalks while replenishing the soil atc

Helpers work at the curing racks setting the tobacco out
to dry inthe sun then packing it into hogsheads for
shipment back to England A sacrament to the Indians
tobacco has become the foundation of Jamestown’ s aconomy
its only significant export Rolfe makes up a pipe

ANGLES ON POCAHONTAS

Wobblehead amuses Pocahontas with his antics as she wanders
along the country lanes

She is a legend to the English who bring her gifts and
leave them at her doorstep She opens the gifts -- strange
hats religious paraphernalia dolls balloons pins She
tries on a hat The taint and burden of her madness falls
away Gradually she grows more English in her ways though
at dawn she swims in the river still and still the elders
spy on her as she does

EXT JAMES RIVER - ABOARD THE MOVING BOAT - LATER

Rolfe has brought Pocahontas out boating on the James Her
unhappiness is no longer so acute and his kindness has
grown upon her Has she begun to sea in hima
reincarnation of her lost lover Though not as handsome or
dashing as Smith Rolfe is an immensely attractive man
Still you can tell from her distracted manner that she
dees not regard him with anything like the feeling she once
had for Smith

ROLFE
Suppose I asked you to marry me What
would you say

POCAHONTAS
Are you asking me
(he nods)
Where would we live

ROLFE
Here” England if you wish Perhaps
that would be best You could forget
your life in this place

POCAHONTAS

I couldn’t live in England Mr Rolfe
ROLFE

Say yes
POCAHONTAS

Listen to you Always giving orders

Something has changed in her She has nowhere to turn and
she desperately wants to make her peace with the world to
live with a semblance of decency again free of scandal of
uncertainty and insolent looks

She nods
his eyes

POCAHONTAS
(stalling)
You don’t know how it is
ROLFE
I do I know what you are going to
tell me in any case I know the
rumors -- that some might be true

She feels an odd desire to humiliate herself in
so that he can entertain no illusion about her

ROLFE
That’s all dead and gone

POCAHONTAS
I wish Id met you first But all the
wishing in the world won’t make it
different
(deflecting him)

’ Have you thought about the looks you

would receive They talk about us
enough already even now You would
feel as though your every thought was
known to them You’re so proud Mr
Rolfe You couldn’t bear it

ROLFE
I would bear it proudly

POCAHONTAS
There are things you don’t know and
could not guess I would be obliged
to tell you all

ROLFE
I know what I have to I know that I
love you

POCAHONTAS

(with difficulty)
You see I despise him but I don’t
know what I would do if he were to
come up from the dead It is better
to face the truth than to hurt you as
well You see I am weak -- too weak
to rely on You should have the sense
to know it as much ag I would like
you to forget it

ROLFE
I dream about you I would give up
everything My friends my land
Everything

Her candor stirs his chivalry He reaches out to take her
hand

ROLFE
Why do you shrink from ma
POCAHONTAS
I wasn’t thinking
ROLFE
Tell me
POCAHONTAS

You know I do not like to talk about
myself I’m not going to let you make
me

ROLFE
Won’t you say yes

She looks at him for a moment

POCAHONTAS
All right If you like

-ROLFE
Don’t you want to

POCAHONTAS
There’s nobody else I would marry

She bursts into tears
ROLFE

This isn’t what I expected Why are
you crying Rebecca

POCAHONTAS
I’m sorry

ROLFE
Why are you crying

POCAHONTAS
I guess becauseI must be happy I
never like to cry It gives me a
headache ButI said I will marry
you I will not love you but I will
marry you

Rolfe considers this remark for a moment

ROLFE
When shall I make the announcement

She looks at him astonished by his kindness and devotion

Though she does not love him she admires him a great deal
She trusts him He is strong and sane She does not know

what else to hope for

ROLFE
You do not love me now Someday you
will Or I shall seek to deserve that
you should

INT JAMESTOWN COUNCIL HOUSE

Rolfe discusses his marriage plans with the elders of
Jamestown Newport presides In an improvised way the
elders discuss their objections to the idea -- precedent
whether they can allow a pracedent for miscegenation etc
Finally Newport intervenes a man of cold logic

NEWPORT
You are not ignorant of tha heavy
displeasure which Almighty God
conceived against the sons of Levi and
Israel for marriage of strange wives

ROLFE
No

NEWPORT
Would you do anything necessary to
bring this about

ROLFE
Yes

NEWPORT

Would you write out a petition
explaining as the wealthiest planter
in Virginia the benefit this would
offer to the colony Could you state
your hope that it might be the
beginning of the great work of
converting the Naturals that this
idea came to you in no way from carnal
affections but for the good of the
Plantation for the glory of God and
your own soul with the purpose of
saving an unbelieving creature moving
an urregenerate to regeneration And
would you add to this that the Lord
should condemn you at the dreadful day
of judgment when the secrets of all
hearts willbe known if this be not
your true intent Would you do that

(Rolfe nods)
Then surely you do love her Write

EXT ROLFE HOUSEHOLD - SERIES OF ANGLES

Rolfe and Pocahontas choose the site where they will build
their house -- beyond the fort on a bank overlooking the
river

ROLFE
We can burn the weeds off here and
make a garden

They wedge the earth open with a digging stick to find the
best topsoil ’

Gradually they settle into a life of quiet domestic joy
Pocahontas milks the cattle and leads them to their stalls
She bakes bread in the oven and watches her husband with a
growing devotion he has saved her from doom

From time to time Indians approach the house to trade with
her husband Covered with soot and sweat sha looks
longingly at them who spend their days as the birds of the
air and lilies of the field She will never again play in
the river or run carefree through the scented forests

Pocahontas has just given birth to a son Rolfe is
overjoyed But when Mary holds the child out to his

EXT JAMES RIVER
Pocahontas sits with Mary on the bank of the James She

looks out across the fields she roamed as a girl to the
stiff ranks of poplar and virgin pine She remembers the

nights when the aurora borealis shimmered above them The

air rings with the cries of children

MARY
You seem happy

POCAHONTAS
I might be I am about to be Do you
ever know I speak with my mother
again I speak with the clouds I
thought it would never be I have a
family now

Pocahontas jumps and skips as she plays with her lovely
child who now is two years old Then suddenly she stops
as though she had noticed how happy she was feeling and
falt guilty about it But it is so wonderful to feel a
part of life again to feel it flowing in her veins Yes
She turns to Rolfe and smiles

VISION OF SMITH

That night Pocahontas dreams of her own mother a lordly
woman who summons up the ghost of Captain Smith Smith has
something in his hand a little book which her mother
insists she take from him She studies the books but she
can make no sense of it When she looks up Smith is
beckoning her Where

You saw him

She turns and walks away Her face is white with shock
INT ROLFE HOUSE

Rolfe leans down to kiss Pocahontas but she eludes him

POCAHONTAS
I cannot do that
ROLFE
Why not
POCAHONTAS

It would mean something I do not feel

ROLFE
What has come over you

POCAHONTAS
I am married to -- him

ROLFE
(after reacting to this)
Married You don’t know the meaning
of the word exactly

POCAHONTAS
But I am
ROLFE
You’ va been so happy

POCAHONTAS
Did I say I had been My heart is
like a stona

Rolfe suffers this remark dumbly He reaches out to take
her hand

POCAHONTAS
I mustn’t do this John Rolfe I
cannot kiss you as before Why do you
tempt me

She walks into the kitchen closing the door behind her

ROLFE
Don’t go

Mad with jealousy Rolfe jerks the door off its hinges

POCAHONTAS
You ought not to have done that It
is not becoming of you Please go
away Will you

ROLFE
I merely wish to say that it is
monstrous you should feel this way

POCAHONTAS
Yes I know It is wicked of me I
am sorry But it is not I altogether
who am to blame

ROLFE
Who is then

POCAHONTAS
Mr Rolfe would you mind my living
away from you

ROLFE
Away from me What was the meaning of
our marrying then

POCAHONTAS
I thought I could do nothing else TI
gave you my promise Then as time
want on I regretted I had and wished
I could find a way to break it off I
thought of the scandal it would cause
-- this frightened me

POCAHONTAS (cont’d)

I of all people ought not to have
cared what people said But I was a
coward -- and I didn’t want to hurt
you Now I see it would have bean
better to have injured your feelings
then than to marry you and injure
them all my life after Will you let
me go away

(pause)
Mr Rolfe why should we let the world
choose our plan of life for us What
is the use of thinking of laws any
laws if they make you miserable when
you knew you are committing no wrong

ROLFE
From my point of view you are
committing a wrong in not liking me

POCAHONTAS
I do like you But I didn’t see it
would be - so much more than that
For a man and a woman to live
together when one feels as I do is
not right There I have said it

She winces inwardly to sea the pain that she is causing
him But he is patient and kind He overlooks insult and
injury He does not stand on his rights nor keep a record
of wrongs His is a love that never gives up

POCAHONTAS
There’s a house in the heart A
little house I can’t help it that he
came to mine

ROLFE
You can

POCAHONTAS
How See my hand

It flutters like a leaf She is faithful to her grief To
think -- she had almost abandoned it

POCAHONTAS
I’m that way all through Don’t leave
me See me through this I don’t say
it’s right Why can’t we agree to
free each other We made the pact
At night when we could not see
Surely we can cancel it Then we
might be friends and meet without pain

With a skeptical air he bows to her and walks off though
from the way in which he watches her hereafter

proof that the heart’s great wilderness can be tamed the
infidel brought to Christ She is the very flesh and
promise of the American soil an Earth Mother as surely as

sees a flag streaming in the breeze She sees a great
Glock too but seems to remember when Smith spoke’ to her of
such things in the woods Her husband does not guess her
thoughts Opechancanough shares her amazement The crowds

ROLFE
She is not She is his except in
name and law She would never have
married me had she known that he were
still alive There is no use in
keeping her chained to me if she does
not balong to me I must set her
free I have reason to believe she
would welcome my taking such a step as
the greatest charity to her And
though she sympathizes with ma as a
husband she cannot abide me

NEWPORT
Such a step might ruin your prospects
in Virginia

ROLFE

If so no one must tell her

No I don’t want your opinion on this
My giving her up can do her no
possible harm and it will opan up a
chance of happiness for her which she
has never dreamt of hitherto

Captain Smith Good as my word
ma’am Most presuming appearing in
this manner without forwarding a
customary note of warning Youd be
within your rights and certainly
within the proprieties to send him
away without an explanation

POCAHONTAS
Indeed Perhaps I should

MARY
(hoping she won’ t)
What shall I say

POCAHONTAS
That you told me That I thanked you
for telling me

Mary leaves giddy with excitement once again she may
resume her role in the drama Pocahontas is pale with
emotion
She gives him a mysterious pat on the cheek as though she
wished to get his hopes up -- to seduce him a little so
that she might turn cold and aloof again and punish him
for his presumption

POCAHONTAS
I had forgotten how forward you are

She strides haughtily across the lawn condescending and
cold She has made herself what he wanted A grand lady
Now let him watch her

SMITH
Giving yourself airs ah Who’s this
man you’re married to

POCAHONTAS
He owns the largest plantation in
Virginia If you must know

You look well Princess Im not
joking You look damn well when
youre properly dressedSo after I

left it -- went well for you

Yes
SMITH

I heard the King and Queen received
you Everybody reports you were a
great favorite They all speak of
you One hears them in the streets
Her Ladyship Who’d have guessed it

He looks deep into her eyes then quickly takes her hand
and holds it like a trapped bird

POCAHONTAS
I cannot deo this

But when he kisses her cheeks and her lips her will melts
away Tongues of fire shoot through her veins and for a
moment she returns the kiss But with the parting of her
lips she lets him go The spell is broken her love has
died passed off like a dream He gazes ardently at her

POCAHONTAS
Are you about to tell me a secret I
hate secrets Whenever anyone asks me
if I would like to hear one I say no
I have not once regretted it
As he talks she looks at him and wonders at how crestfallan
he who used to have the assurance of a man who
She wanted him brought low but
What does it mean that he

he seems

had never known defeat
this is more than she can bear
ence loved her and she loved him Where did it all go

He no longer is the person she yearned for
fact to have forgotten who that person was
who stands before her now is common as clay -- the last

SMITH
I was born in a tanner’s shed Never
had a thing No property no rank no
chance of gatting hold of anything
except with my own hands I couldn’t
afford the luxury of being a
gentleman You think Iliked being
what I was I saw a chance to change
it I can’t be blamed for wanting to
Nobody respects a poor man I put my
not getting on in life down to them
persistently sending me off to fight
their wars for them I always felt I
would break through -- the next day

the next hour -- that something grand
was Waiting for me -- a destiny all my
own -- above the common one

SMITH
You knew that I had promise didn’t

POCAHONTAS
Oh yes Did you find your Indies

SMITH
After I left Virginia I got the idea
of going south to Venezuela and the
Guyanas east of Pizarro’s lands I
had heard of a city there But they
withdrew the funds as I was about to
sail So I went to New England
Mapped it Then the honest citizens
went over I was fool enough not to
insist upon a contract in advance
They’ re making the world in their own
likeness clear to the Pole

She seems in
The figure

Where did he wander from the

SMITH (cont’ d)

There is nowhere they are not I had
no idea my life would be spent in the
company of thieves of those
especially who steal with a pen I
dreamed of something else great
voyages of discovery the land opening
before me new republics without a
history magic new races a new world
to shame the old The Indies -- they
were like a mirage for me

(intercut his shadow

moving over the ground

high walls the St

Lawrence River winding

into the west etc)
I always thought they were around the
next bend -- the next thing then the
next Newfoundland St Rupert’s
Island Every time I told myself
“Have faith Wait They are coming”
I covered the whole world Hard as I
searched I never found what I was
looking for After a while I gave up
striving Maybe I should have gone
farther north That’s where all the
excitement is now Perhaps there is
no passage Perhaps it was a dream
In some respects I’ve been a failure

And yet I saw -- with you I knew You
ware my America or there is none at
all

He is conscious of looking as though he had fallen on hard
times While her husband enjoys the fruits of her Virginia
patrimony he for all his prodigies of exploration and
adventuring cannot lay claim to so much as a foot of land
in the New World He is alone bereft of hearth and home

It embarrasses him that she should find him at such a pass
Her gaze reaches into him like a ray of sunlight into a
forest She alone knew the secret promise of his
existence And seeing her he knows that promise is nearly
gone he is nothing more than what he now seems

SMITH

May I speak with you this way
POCAHONTAS

Of course
SMITH

I wonder

POCAHONTAS
Your worldly failure if you insist
upon considering it that is to your
credit rather than your blame You
should remember that the best people
are those who do themselves no worldly

good Every successful man is more or
less a selfish one

He looks around The lawn and woods buzz with spring’s
ventriloquisms The bees are drowsy with nectar

POCAHONTAS
John

SMITH
I forgot what I was going to say

POCAHONTAS
It must have been a lie

They smile There is a peace between them She has let
him go

SMITH
I suppose a person of your commendable
nature cannot be sad for long

She lets this illusion stand

POCAHONTAS
No You know that we were very happy
‘once Because that is the only thing
I could not bear --’if you had
forgotten

He sees what a noble being ha allowed to escape him
Before he can return to his senses they have said goodbye

SMITH’S POVS - MUSIC

Smith watches her go off The Indies music comes softly
in and now it occurs to him that if he has not found his
dream perhaps he was looking for it in the wrong place -
in the outer kingdom of riches and glory when all the
while it lay within in the love and the pain he shared
with this woman

Was she the wondrous destiny that lay in store for him

Was she his Indies Did he sail past them mistaking where
they lay or never believing they could be found or worse
yet -- a lover of thrasholds -- afraid to set foot there

And even as this thought comes over him with extraordinary
force he knows that it will pass that he will again take
up the illusions of his daily life The blinding insight
will seem a creature of this present hour a passing fancy

EXT HEACHAM HALL - LATER

Rolfe arrives home Pocahontas comas out to greet him
She carries on almost as though nothing had ever come
between tham

POCAHONTAS
John I have a desire to see Virginia
again I don’t know how long it’s
been since I saw a blue sky or swam in
the river -- and the people area so
very nice but my jaws ache from
smiling and -- couldn’t we go homa

ROLFE
As soon as possible

POCAHONTAS
Before you say that I should tell you
that Captain Smith paid me a visit I
received him and I let him hold my
hand -- a long while I don’t know
whether you think it wrong

ROLFE
(distracted)
Oh did you What did you do that
for
POCAHONTAS
I am not sure He wanted to and I
let him

She is surprised that he does not scold her

POCAHONTAS
Furthermore I kissed him and let him
kiss ma

ROLFE
The old story

POCAHONTAS

I didn’t know we were going to until
we did
ROLFE

May I ask how many times this
occurred

POCAHONTAS
Thomas Come closer I was in the
house and the movers took a big trunk
away and I found this in a chink of
the wall A map

His eyes light up as she unravels the old scroll The
blood of two races flows in the hoy

THOMAS
What does it say

POCAHONTAS
Give me time Can we talk here No --
the maids are so nosey Close the
door We mustn’t tell anybody else
You wont will you I won’t either
It’s signed by a Spanish lord
Stamped with his seal He says that
if we follow it precisely we will
come to a stone man holding a great
fish with a waterfall coming from its
mouth

EXT GROUNDS - SERIES OF ANGLES

They rush around the grounds from one place to another
following the directions to the treasure

POCAHONTAS
Wait wait Now it says that we
should bow three times to each other

They bow to each other as specified and hurry off to the
next clue until at length thay come to a huge mossy statue
of a cherub holding a fish A fountain bubbles from the
fish’s mouth

THOMAS
Mother

He gapes at the mysterious figure Then he looks at her
and realizes she has been leading him on and he begins to
chase her They laugh and cavort wildly

POCAHONTAS (0S)
Reach in there

Thomas walks carefully to flower pot at a corner of the
field puts his hand inside and draws out a glass frog

POCAHONTAS
(whispering)
What is it
173B

POCAHONTAS
A good many I don’t remember And I
Called him my dear friend He spoke
of some things of the past and it
overcame me
(pause)
You don’t seem very upset

ROLFE
Perhaps I feel numb
POCAHONTAS
(puzzled)
You didn’t know that he was coming
did you
ROLFE

What you suggest is beneath the
conduct of a gentleman

POCAHONTAS
I loved a dream Will you have me
back Will you forgive me for
neglecting you Can you forget

(he nods)
Now I know what true love is Now I
am home

Eyes bent in repentance she takes his hand and presses it
against her cheek It is the first time we have seen them
touch each other Their child watching from afar senses
his parents’ joy It seems to him they are united at last

THOMAS’ POVS ON POCAHONTAS AND ROLFE

Thomas watches undetected as his mother and father go
hand in hand about the grounds happily observing those
commonplace scenes of life that perhaps meant little enough
to them before but which now suddenly have a power to
convey all the meaning and glory of love’s new world a dog
chasing doves a trea bowing its head the wind on a pond

At last to his astonished joy they kiss With a fine
sense of discretion the child hurries away His heart
beats in his throat

EXT HEACHAM HALL - DUSK
Later the same day or week young Thomas looks up with a

start His mother rushes in with a parchment scroll she
has found unable to restrain her excitement

She takes a moment to compose herself to savor the last
moments of her innocence Will she know him Will she be
able to speak with him

EXT HEACHAM LAWN

She goes out the front door onto the lawn and there he
stands - her first love Smith looks up She is radiant
in her silks and finery utterly transformed from the wood
nymph he knew She has achieved culture station
refinement wealth become the sophisticated soul he

thought she could never be while he has grownmore animal

She lets him look at her She trembles under his gaze

SMITH
Did I make a mistake in coming here

POCAHONTAS
That is for you to decide But I
don’t see how you could think it so
goon

SMITH
I would have come before axcept that
I’ve been away from the capital
Business you know Small excuse
considering that I owe you my life

POCAHONTAS
Don’t trouble yourself on that
account

SMITH

Perhaps I’m out of bounds speaking
this way but I’ve thought of you
often I was a fool not to have bound
my fate with yours I might be a
happy man now A prosperous one in
any case

POCAHONTAS
Is that so

She will not give him anything He will have to beg her

SMITH
I would not lie to you No more than
I would cheat at cards Be good for
once and don’t make a scene I
confass that I am more or less than
a gentleman You once gave me the
benefit of the doubt

POCAHONTAS
I never told you that I did

oN

POCAHONTAS
Be strong my husband This must
happen to us all What does it matter
if I come a little before or after
I’m going to see my father and my
mother and as she whispered to me so
shall I to you Sea if you can hear
me I will use the wind for a tongue

EXT GRAVESEND DOCK COTTAGE WINDOW BACKYARD ETC

The curtains whisper over the sash as Pocahontas’ spirit
makes its departure Her effects are put away The
fisherman’s daughter shakes out the pillows that she slept
on

ROLFE (0S)
“She said that she would be in our
breath and in the ground beneath our
feet bearing us up She refused all
sympathy saying it was enough that
you her child --
(over scenes of America)
-- should live”

Rolfe boards a ship Opechancanough his face painted with
ashes follows him up the gangplank

SHIP DEPARTING GRAVESEND AS SEEN FROM DOCK

At the Gravesend dock sailors and fishermen go about their
tasks -- mending nets caulking the seams

As the end credits begin to roll the ship with its great
white sails is already in the offing -- Virginia-bound

ABOARD THE SHIP - THE BOY
Thomas looks out over the waves
EXT VIRGINIA WOODS

The New World pines sway back and forth in ecstasy forever
awaiting the determined sailor

THE END

P

He brings her the frog cupping it with both hands as
though it wera a great jewel

POCAHONTAS
Oh Thomas You said you wouldn’t
tell anybody It will be our sacret

She looks at him and remembers when she too shone in this
way and all the world about her She misses her daily
salute to the rising sun the times when she found a birds
Nest or vaulted up a tree the shock of the cold water as
she plunged into the river -- all those little moments of
her life that no one else can remember or will ever know
about

The wind comes up through the trees Suddenly to her
son’s delight she performs a cartwheel in her English
dress Rolfe looks on from afar well pleased

The story could end here with a legend describing what
happened to the characters or else it might continue with
these next concluding scenes -

EXT GRAVESEND COTTAGE - A FEW WEEKS LATER

On their way back to America the Rolfes have stopped in
Gravesend the last port for sea-bound vessels

ROLFE (0S)
“13 April 1616 --

Dear Son I write this sc that
you might have it someday in the
future Your dear mother Rebecca
fell ill in our outward passage at
Gravesend a small fishing town at the
mouth of thea Thames where the river
flows out into the sea”

Opechancanough bursts out of a cottage screaming in a wild
Pamunkey way The citizens look at him as though he were a
madman

INT COTTAGE BEDROOM

Thomas Rolfe peers at his mother through a crack ina
bedroom door The young lady attending him a fisherman’s
daughter inspects the glass frog

YOUNG LADY
She gave you this Very expensive
Remember her dearie

Tears stream down Rolfe’s face Pocahontas lies in bed
surrounded by a radiance of white linen
