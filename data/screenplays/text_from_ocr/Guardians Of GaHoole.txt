told by Noctus)

BC 01 WHITENESS BC 01

The white seems to be rushing -- in motion -- and we
begin to make out little speckles of black and brown
mixed into it and soon the whiteness separates to
reveal feathers

The feathers are in flight rustling in the wind -- we’re
above a lattice of owls flying through the sky

NOCTUS (VO)
It happened in the old ages Well
before I was a hatchling They
called themselves the ‘pure ones’
and they led a crusade against us
Their aim was to take control of
the owl kingdoms

SUPERIMPOSE a MAP (with an owlish aesthetic) shows the
spread of the forces of the Pure Ones spreading across
the Owl lands

NOCTUS (VO)
and their methods were harsh
and unyielding

A lonely wounded OWL looks up from his scorched hollow
He sees the skies fill with owls -- Pure Ones -- massing
en route to a battle and retreats deeper inside

NOCTUS (VO)
What they didn’t take they burned
to the ground and those they
couldn’t enslave they destroyed
Owls the noblest of the birds
found themselves humbled and
soon in despair One by one
their lands were subjugated

Slave owls work tilling for the Pure Ones building their
great edifices

NOCTUS (VO)
Owls’ feathers were torn out
wings clipped Those who
surrendered became earthbound

BC O01 BC 01
NOCTUS (VO) (CONTD)
All would have been lost to the
pure ones but for a different band
of owls who rose from the mists of
the Sea of Hoolemere and from the
Great Tree itself

The Ga‘Hoole tree glorious taking up its own small
island From its mists emerge the GUARDIANS a formation
of owls in battle finery each leaping into flight off
each of the tree’s limbs (Their feathers were in the
opening image)

NOCTUS (VO)
A group of warriors who had sworn
an oath to make strong the weak
to mend the broken to vanquish
the evil

SUPERIMPOSE THE GUARDIANS OF GA’HOOLE

The Guardians fly over ocean and forests their leader --
LYZE OF KIEL -- in front

NOCTUS (VO)
the Guardians They followed
their leader Lyze of Kiel to
meet the Pure Ones and their
leader Surtr in a great battle
above the rocky coastline of the
Northern Kingdom

The Pure Ones come into sight Their leader -- SURTR --
is a whiskered screech owl in full battle paraphernalia

The GUARDIANS wait and bank

War The sky darkens as feathers and claws crush
together

NOCTUS (VO)
The two sides fought fiercely --
the Guardians at least with
honor

Wherever we look the Pure Ones seem to be getting the
advantage unafraid to use their Battle Claws in the most
brutal of ways

NOCTUS (VO)
But Surtr’s men were great in
number And the Pure Ones seemed
to gain the advantage

(MORE )

( )

BC 01 BC 01
NOCTUS (VO) (CONTD)
(beat)
The battle grew desperate and the
Guardians’ eyes turned to Lyze
and his fight with Surtr

Lyze is engaged in claw to claw combat with Surtr

They HIT each other full force -- Battle Claws
interlocking with a stream of SPARKS

Lyze is much smaller but holds his own Surtr gets a
Battle Claw free SLASHES at Lyze’s right foot and
Lyze’s Battle Claw FLIES INTO THE AIR and STICKS into a
piece of rocky cliff

Seeing this gives the Pure Ones impetus to push

forward

Lyze disengages -- two claws of his natural talon sliced
off with his Battle Claw His flying is affected and he
wavers

Surtr banks around to attack Lyze once more preparing to
go in for the kill

Lyze flies lamely and Surtr DIVES down trying to slice
the top of Lyze’s neck -- but at the last possible moment
Lyze FLIPS OVER on his back thrusts his good Battle Claw
right into Surtr’s face Surtr SCREECHES as his helmet
falls his face sliced open by Lyze’s Battle Claw His
wings fold into his body and he drops like a stone
SCREECHING in anguish as he disappears into the clouds

NOCTUS (VO)
Shall I stop

FL 01 INT AN OWL HOLLOW - MORNING FL 01

The morning sunlight shines on three young Barn Owls
looking up at their father NOCTUS

SOREN the middle owlet and his sister EGLANTINE a
downy hatchling SHAKE their heads vigorously they want
more story Their older brother KLUDD looks skeptical
and bored

SOREN
What

NOCTUS
I don’t want to give you daymares

( )
FL 01

MARELLA
(gently)
Then for goodness’ sake why not
tell them the end of the story

KLUDD
Because we know how it ends
We’ve heard it a thousand times
It’s all Soren ever wants to hear

EGLANTINE
« I do too

NESTING AREA

A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE ON the hollow as MRS
PLITHIVER the family’s blind nurse-snake straightens
out the nests for the owlet’s beds She listens with
sympathetic concern for Kludd as Noctus talks

MRS PLITHIVER
(to herself)
Oh young owls and their
stories

BACK TO SCENE

KLUDD
The Guardians win la la la they
go home

NOCTUS

If the Guardians hadn’t won boy
we’d all be slaves to the Pure
Ones Because they won we’re
free

KLUDD
To listen to silly stories

NOCTUS
- if you’re scared Kludd
there’s no shame in it

KLUDD
How can I be scared by something
that never happened

SOREN
It happened

NOCTUS
My father told me this story and
his father told him And above
all I feel it in my gizzard

KLUDD
I don’t
SOREN
I do
EGLANTINE
(echoing)
So do I

FL 01

Mrs Plithiver sensing that Noctus is growing concerned
slithers out

Noctus and

MRS PLITHIVER
Kludd the forest is large All
creatures need to make their path
through it together

KLUDD
Snakes don’t have gizzards

MRS PLITHIVER
We snakes have our ways too

NOCTUS
A gizzard is an owl’s most
important asset It tells us
which way’s north it tells us
which way’s home Through our
gizzards the voices of the ages
whisper to us And tell us what’s
right

KLUDD
I know what’s right I won’t be
my gizzard’s slave And I won’t
be a slave to the ‘voices of the
ages’

MARELLA
Noctus Let’s find a happy note
to end on It’s almost first-
light and we need mice

Marella leave Mrs Plithiver slithers over
to help tuck the children in tighter

MRS PLITHIVER
Oh your father loved that story
when he was a hatchling Soren

MRS PLITHIVER (CONTD)
I used to read it to him every
night

KLUDD
How could you read it You can’t
even see

MRS PLITHIVER
(firmly)
I could see the truth of it
(completely kindly)
But those are enough stories
It’s time for young owls to roost

Mrs Plithiver kisses and “hugs” them for a moment
wrapping herself around them (she moves as if she knows
their shapes) -- and then she slides off their nests
Mrs Plithiver arthritic CRICKS for a moment before un-
kinking herself

MRS PLITHIVER
The moss and down are extra soft
for you Eglantine

As she goes back to her part of the hollow Kludd looks
at the whole scene with impatience bordering on
contempt

EXT TREE BRANCH - MOMENTS LATER FL 06

Noctus and Marella pause for a moment on the branch
outside their hollow

MARELLA
Noctus if he doesn’t want to hear
the story stop telling it to him
It’s only making him more
frustrated --

NOCTUS
I want him to understand An owl
without a gizzard

MARELLA
He has one But he’s losing his
down and maybe now just isn’t

the time

NOCTUS
Now is precisely the time I
feel as if something’s wrong in
the forest

MARELLA
What do you mean

NOCTUS
- just my gizzard But I want
them to be prepared and I’m
worried What kind of owl will
Kludd be

Marella gets Noctus’ attention

MARELLA
Noctus -- he’1ll be a fine owl

Noctus takes heart In tandem they leap off the branch
and launch into flight --

And we REVEAL the expanse of the forest It’s late
summer heading into the very beginning of autumn

Noctus and Marella fly down to the ground where they
silently and swiftly pick a mouse up as they fly further
afield

FL 07 INT TREE HOLLOW - DAWN FL 07

The younger owls are supposed to be sleeping standing in
their down-and-moss lined nests heads dipped into their
wings Dappled sunlight filters through the branches
and reflects in their trough of water

EGLANTINE
(whispers)
Soren What happened next

Soren has a book nearby to consult

SOREN
(whispers)
You remember Lyze striking the
final blow sending Surtr
spiraling to his death

EGLANTINE
Yes I remember

SOREN
Well once the ‘pure ones’ were
vanquished peace returned to the
land and Lyze led the victorious
Guardians home across the Sea of
Hoole’mere and back to the Great
Tree

KLUDD
Soren we know You’ve drawn it
on our wall and we’ve heard the
story a thousand times

Soren looks a little abashed we TURN TO the hollow
wall and reveal the story has indeed been etched in
naive owlish hand

The reflected dappled light almost makes the pictures
come to life

KLUDD
You have a soft head Soren
Think about something real like
flying or hunting

SOREN
(hurt )
I do
KLUDD
Prove it
SOREN
How
KLUDD

Just spend one day not thinking
about the Guardians for a change
Think about real things instead

SOREN
I’l1l try

But Soren looks crushed
EGLANTINE
(whispers )
Soren Da say it’s in your nature
to think of better things

SOREN
I know But maybe Kludd’s right

Eglantine goes to sleep Soren troubled stays awake

EXT TREE BRANCHES - NIGHT FL
Outside Noctus teaches Kludd to branch

Kludd hops from branch to branch He’s quiet in the air
but not graceful each time he lands it’s with an

audible CRUNCH He has the skill but no finesse
( )

FL 10 FL 10

NOCTUS
Kludd owls make the best hunters
for one reason alone --

KLUDD

I know their silent flight
NOCTUS

Not just in flight in landing

too

KLUDD
It doesn’t matter By the time I
have my claws out --

NOCTUS
The mice will have run away And
you and your hatchlings’1l go
hungry

Kludd focuses angrily and tries again

FL 05 INT TREE HOLLOW - NEXT NIGHT FL 05

Soren and Eglantine are playing Soren jumps INTO FRAME
channeling his father as Lyze

SOREN
Surtr I’ve given you every
chance

Eglantine is dressed as Surtr but she doesn’t reply
SOREN

(trying again)
Surtr I’ve given you every

chance
EGLANTINE
You told me Id be Lyze
SOREN
Next go Alright
EGLANTINE
I trust you wouldn’t lie to --
Surtr
Eglantine “strikes” -- but Soren strikes back cutting

off her play-beak which is made of a curled leaf

EGLANTINE
My beak

FL 05 FL 05

MRS PLITHIVER
(sounding crisp)

Soren

SOREN
Oh -- we were only playing Mrs
Plithiver

MRS PLITHIVER
But aren’t you supposed to be
branching

SOREN
Da said not till there was a
gibbous moon

MRS PLITHIVER
Soren isn’t there a gibbous
moon

Soren rushes to take off his armor and go out

FL 02 EXT TREE BRANCHES - MOMENTS LATER FL 02

Kludd and Noctus are branching together Kludd makes a
poor and noisy landing

NOCTUS
Kludd You have strength but in
branching you need grace too

Kludd looks frustrated

NOCTUS
Don’t worry You’ll get there

Soren rushes up towards them

NOCTUS
Well young Guardian I don’t
think your first branching lesson
will be that dangerous

Noctus gently takes the helmet off and Soren’s not a
little abashed

NOCTUS
(to Soren)
Let’s give your brother a rest
(beat)
Now don’t worry how much noise
you make in the beginning I’m
here to catch you if you --

( )
FL 02

FL

Soren leaps to the next branch -- flying and landing
silently much better than Kludd Soren glances back up
to his father Noctus looks proud

NOCTUS
Well done

Kludd looks at Soren with cold fury and frustrated
leaps -- ambitiously but Kludd snaps the branch he lands
on It falls to the forest floor

NOCTUS
Kludd Land first then wrap your
talons gently --

KLUDD
I know

SOREN
It helps when I picture where I’m
going to land --

KLUDD
I don’t need your help

Soren’s momentarily hurt Then he branches again He
loves this -- it’s what he’s been waiting for

NOCTUS
You’re doing very well Soren

KLUDD
(whispers)
Beginner’s luck

SOREN
Can we come with you on the hunt

NOCTUS
Not tonight

Noctus and Marella acknowledge one another as she comes
out to join him

NOCTUS
But when the time comes at
least you have the helmet for it

Noctus hands the helmet back to Soren who’s lost

interest in it now -- it’s not flying Noctus puts a
wing on Kludd’s shoulder to try and cheer him up

( )

FL 02 FL 02

NOCTUS
Kludd look after your brother and
sister tonight while your mother
and I are hunting alright They
look up to you

Kludd nods proud Noctus has given him this
responsibility

NOCTUS
And don’t worry about your
branching You just have to trust
your gizzard and you’1ll grasp it

Kludd shrinks His parents watch him go inside and make
sure the owlets are safe before flying off
FL 03 HOLLOW - MOMENTS LATER FL 03

Soren comes back in to see Eglantine dressed as Lyze and
waiting to play

EGLANTINE
Surtr -- are you ready to be sent
to your doom

SOREN
Oh I’m tired of playing games

Eglantine Wait till you --

Then Soren sees how disappointed Eglantine looks He
picks up the claw and pretends he’s been playing all
along

SOREN
you fool To trust Surtr

While they’re playing Eglantine looks surprised
shocked

EGLANTINE
Ow

SOREN
Eglantine are you alright

Mrs Plithiver senses what’s happening and comes over to
help

MRS PLITHIVER

Oh it’s alright dear if it
wants to come out let it

( )

FL 03 FL 03
Soon out of Eglantine’s beak comes -- a small lumpen
thing Eglantine looks at it in horror She stares for
a moment
EGLANTINE

what is it

MRS PLITHIVER
It’s your first pellet

EGLANTINE
(horrified)
- there’ll be more

MRS PLITHIVER
Of course You know your brothers
have them

EGLANTINE
I just thought they were
disgusting

SOREN
(good-natured
teasing)
Don’t you recognize it Eg It
was the mouse you ate Its fur
and bones anyway

Eglantine starts to cry

MRS PLITHIVER
You know Eg I think I’ve kept
the boys’ first pellets I might
even have your father’s first
Maybe you’d like to see them
Now where did I put those

SORENKLUDD
(embarrassed)
No

But it stops Eglantine’s tears Cheekily she nods and
Mrs Plithiver takes her to the back of the hollow

MRS PLITHIVER
Come on then

Soren waits for a moment until Mrs P is safely out of
earshot He looks back to the branches and excited
whispers

SOREN
Kludd

( )

FL 03 FL 03
KLUDD
What
SOREN
Want to go out and try some more
branching

Kludd is impressed and quite delighted by this

KLUDD
(leading him on)
But Da told us to stay in

SOREN
I know but the sooner we can fly
the sooner we’ll be owls You
said I should stop playing games

KLUDD
Yes I did
Kludd spreads out his wing to Soren -- after you

FC 01 EXT BRANCHES - MOMENTS LATER FC 01
Kludd branches -- CRUNCH Again Soren branches over
landing gracefully

SOREN
Could I just show you how
KLUDD
Alright
SOREN

Take a deep breath Put your
wings back lean forward feel
the air and picture how your
talons’11 curl around the branch

quietly --

KLUDD
(overlapping
increasingly
resentful)
Alright alright alright

Kludd shoves Soren -- annoyed but not expecting he will
fall

As Soren falls he opens his wings knocking Kludd back
who falls too

FC 02 EXT THE GROUND - MOMENTS LATER FC 02

they both hit the ground lifting themselves up with
some difficulty

KLUDD
- very quiet Thank you for
showing me

The forest looks very different on the ground than it

does in the hollow -- full of menace and strange shadows
SOREN
Kludd -- we have to get home
KLUDD
How

Soren looks up the trunk of tree It’s a long long way
up to the hollow

SOREN
Mrs P

KLUDD
Quiet

SOREN
Why

KLUDD

There are strange things down
here Not just mice

Soren lowers his voice

SOREN
If we can fly to that branch we
could climb our way up

Soren tries to fly -- he flaps his wings but it just
exhausts him Kludd doesn’t even try

KLUDD
Maybe if we wait the Guardians’‘1l
save us and take us to the Ga

There’s a NOISE Soren and Kludd glance around What
was that Before they have time to respond --

A TASMANIAN DEVIL leaps out of the underbrush and charges
right for Kludd fangs bared

Kludd runs but the Tasmanian Devil is much faster It
has him in his paws in an instant

( )

FC 02 FC 02

Soren jumps on the Tasmanian Devil’s back CLAWING and
PECKING at it with all his might The distraction is
enough for the Devil to let go of Kludd and go after
Soren

Kludd doesn’t return the favor -- he scurries away to
tend to his wound Soren desperately tries to avoid the
Tasmanian Devil’s teeth

And then just as it looks like Soren is going to be a

Tasmanian Devil’s dinner we hear a tremendous SCREECH --
making the Devil turn its head And out of the sky --

A GREATER SOOTY OWL

SWOOPS down from the moonlit sky and quickly attacks the
Devil with its BATTLE CLAWS

WIDER

The Devil DROPS Soren and defends itself

Soren jumps back onto his talons and watches the Sooty
Owl battle the Devil beak agape

Soren and Kludd are mesmerized and don’t hear two other
owls -- JATT AND JUTT -- silently flying towards them
until they’re in their shadow and it’s too late

They lift Soren and Kludd up into the air

Kludd now bears a scar on his cheek from where the Devil
clawed him

JA 01 JATT AND JUTT JA 01
are bullies -- not unfunny bullies but still
SOREN
where are you taking us

JUTT

To a home Just not your old

home
JATT

Well take better care of you than
your parents did Letting you
play down in the muck like that

SOREN
Who --

( )

JA 01 JA 01

JUTT
That’s enough questions now
JATT
Yes Quite enough
JUTT
No more whats No more whys

JATT
No more wh’s at all
KLUDD
(shakes and twists to

get out)
Put us down then --

Jutt angles Kludd’s head to look at the distance to the

ground
JUTT
-- really
Kludd shuts up
JATT
Good owlet
Soren tries to look for landmarks -- boulders unusual

trees anything to guide the way home

Soren looks back towards his home it’s receding until
finally it’s no bigger than a dot and then it’s
invisible For a moment Kludd and Soren are united in
their fear

JA 03 EXT THE AIR - EVEN LATER IN THE NIGHT JA 03

We RISE OVER a desert Our owlets are joined by other
owls holding other kidnapped owlets

One of the new owls comes right next to Jutt -- GRIMBLE
a long-suffering servant a bit more humane than the
others the Ray Winstone of owls Nevertheless he’s a
large owl and commands respect

At the same time Soren notices a baby Elf Owl (not a
Tyto) in the owl’s talons This is GYLFIE She’s tiny
only 5 inches long with brownish-grey plumage and large
bright-yellow eyes She looks terrified

JUTT
Grimble

GRIMBLE
Jutt
JUTT
Grimble
(sniggers)
I don’t want to alarm you friend
but
(can’t stop laughing)
Looks like you dropped your owl
GRIMBLE
I’m holding it Jutt A desert
owl They’re small
JATT
Sure it’s not a hairy snail
JUTT
Or a pellet Wait it blinked A
blinking pellet Amazing
Grimble looks at Jutt -- his stare is enough to shut him
up Soren and Gylfie are close enough to speak
GYLFIE
Did they bring you from the
forest
SOREN

And you from the desert

Gylfie nods

GYLFIE
Who are they
SOREN
It’s so strange it reminds me

of a story my Da told

KLUDD
Of course it does

SOREN
It can’t be though

GYLFIE
I’m Gylfie

SOREN

I’m Soren And this is my
brother Kludd --

JA 03 JA 03

JUTT
Stop talking

Soren looks ahead He sees

FROM HIS POV

They’re heading for an ominous series of cracks in the

earth -- a labyrinth of jagged canyons deep ravines and
scraggy trenches It’s awe-inspiring and it’s supposed
to be

BACK TO SCENE

The formation banks and heads for one of the larger
canyons where a plume of smoke emanates from some
unknown source deep within the crevice

JA 04 EXT ABOVE THE CREVICE - NIGHT JA 04

The formation passes through two tusk-like rock
formations On top of each tusk SENTRIES -- Sooty Owls
-- stand watch

The formation flies toward an edifice carved into the
face of the canyon midway up (like Petra Jordan for
owls) It looks ancient worn from centuries of
weather

They’re flown inside

AA 01 INT ST AEGOLIUS - MOMENTS LATER AA 01
» and we SWOOP IN WITH them

Soren takes in what’s around him -- it’s like a
Dickensian orphanage Soren Gylfie and the other owlets
in their formation are DROPPED landing among other
owlets all of them trying to understand where they are
and what’s going on around them

Soren stands wing back aggressively looking to strike
back at Jutt -- but Jutt’s gone

SOREN
Gylfie Kludd
It’s chaos Soren makes his way through the crowd -- and
so does Gylfie -- until they find one another

( )
AA 01

AA 01

GYLFIE
What on earth are they doing

Soren just shakes his head He has no idea

They’re toward the back of the crowd of owlets and watch
as Jatt and Jutt move through the crowd pointing the non-
Tyto owlets to a little area in front of a doorway

JATT
Go over there and wait You’ll be
a picker

JUTT
You’re a picker too Go with
him

Some owlets panic and cry Soren sees Jatt and Jutt
reach a Tyto and say

JATT
Youll be a soldier Over there
if you will

Soren realizes the Tytos and non-Tytos are being
separated just as Grimble stands on a platform and takes
charge

GRIMBLE
uiet You owlets have been
brought to St Aegolius You’1l
be sorted For your own good
Some will be pickers some will be
soldiers But in their ways all
will help serve the Pure Ones

GYLFIE
(cries out)
We don’t want to serve the Pure
Ones

OTHER OWLETS
Let us go (etc)

GRIMBLE
I said be quiet

This shuts them up for a moment
Jatt and Jutt keep sorting getting closer to Gylfie and

Soren -- Jatt beams when he pushes through two non-Tytos
to reveal a Tyto ASGEIR

( )

e FH HH

AA 01

JATT
You pickers -- clear a path for
this soldier
(to Asgeir)

Over there if you please

AA 01

Asgeir makes his way to the little gathering area to join
the other Tyto

As Asgeir walks there he manages to push past Kludd
quite aggressively (Kludd hasn’t been sorted yet though

he can see

how this is going)

SOREN
(to Gylfie)
Well stay together Alright
She nods just before -- Jutt finds his way to Gylfie
JUTT

She doesn’t move

Look who it is The talking
pellet

JATT
it’s the talking pellet

GYLFIE
I want to go home

JUTT
You’1ll be back at home -- as a
picker

GYLFIE
No

Gylfie -- Soren gets in his way

SOREN
Leave her alone

JATT
Hush owlet You’ll be a soldier

SOREN
A soldier And fight for what
No I want to stay with my friend

GYLFIE
Let us go

Jutt and Jatt try to manhandle

AA 01 AA 01

WHOOSH Everyone looks up when they hear the sound of
owl wings being deliberately flapped together -- and all
activity stops at the sound of owl wings (deliberately)
beating Soren Gylfie Kludd and everyone else looks
up to see --

NYRA She glides overhead flies through the assembled
owlets spreading her wings to show her amazing plumage
and making a great entrance -- the Vanessa Redgrave of
owls

NYRA
Oh
(flaps majestically)
This is a sorry group A scruffy
group

Jutt Jatt and the others look abashed They’re all in
thrall to her

NYRA

Is there any one among them who is
pure I can barely see them Oh
it’s lost The glorious cause is
lost The high Tyto will be very
disappointed

(beat)
And yet and yet you are here
our charges I am Nyra and I am
sorry if your flight was rough
But here orphans you will find
succor You’ll find relief This
is your home And we will --

GYLFIE
Were not orphans
SOREN
She’s right We aren’t orphans

Let us go

Nyra irritated flaps her wings and flies over to
confront Gylfie

NYRA
What is this
(to Soren)
Tyto don’t waste your time don’t
soil your feathers --

SOREN
She’s my friend Leave her be

( )

AA 01 AA 01

NYRA
Oh A spirited little Tyto How
touching You and your patch of
felt will stay together then

Soren looks relieved

NYRA
(bellows )

As pickers
The guards move them along

NYRA
(to Soren)
Perhaps when you remember your
nobility Tyto we can make a
soldier of you until then this
misplaced concern of yours is
merely offensive

SOREN
I want to stay with my brother
too

NYRA

Oh Where’s he

SOREN
Kludd

He raises a wing and sees Kludd in the distance Nyra
swoops over towards him

NYRA
Owlet That one says you’re his
brother Is that true

Kludd makes eye contact with Soren and then very
deliberately turns so his back is to him

Soren can’t believe it but he’s shoved along

Nyra sizes Kludd up and raises her wing at him
approvingly

NYRA
There is a soldier

Kludd is guided towards the other Tyto-soldiers

AA 02 INT PICKERS’ PASSAGEWAY - LATER AA 02

Gylfie looks to Soren as they march down the line for
pickers The owls around him do look much scruffier than
he does only he has some requisite nobility It’s an
eerie scene

GYLFIE
I think I got you in trouble

SOREN
no I think ‘trouble’ began
some time ago

GYLFIE
What is this place

SOREN
In Da’s stories the ‘pure ones’
stole children and made them
slaves

GYLFIE
Who

SOREN
The Pure Ones They needed slave
power to take the owl
territories I thought it all

They pass a moon-blinked owl with a heavy basket on his
back He almost knocks Soren over

SOREN
Hey

But the owl keeps walking

SOREN
What’s wrong with him
GYLFIE
He looks like he’s been moon-
blinked
SOREN
What’s that
GYLFIE

Oh if you’d grown up in the
desert you’d know You should
never sleep right under the moon

SOREN
Why would you It’s not natural

GYLFIE
It isn’t But sometimes in the
desert owls get exhausted and
they end up collapsed under it
But when they wake up something’s
wrong with their gizzard and
they’ve forgotten who they are

Just as Gylfie finishes saying this they reach

MB 01 EXT GLAUCIDIUM TWO - SAME TIME MB 01

An open-air box canyon filled with hundreds of owlets of
various breeds colors and sizes most lit by the warm
reddish light of a moon slightly fuller than it was the
last time we saw it Soren and Gylfie are among them

Jutt and Jatt (among other guards) guide the owlets
inside They’re trying to sound gentler conciliatory

JATT
Come in owls come in It’s been
a long journey and now it’s time
to rest

They both fly and walk through the crowd
JUTT

Yes rest all of you Stand
straight Your heads up

JATT
All up

SOREN
No You have to let us go Let
us out

Quite a few of the other owlets nod and hoot in
agreement

Alright But sleep first and
then tomorrow --

Jatt flies over and raises a wing to strike Soren and
Gylfie -- it’s Grimble who restrains him
GRIMBLE
It’s alright Jatt I brought her

too
Jatt backs down but huffily
JATT
Brought her in Yeah that’s
right no vole for you I brought
the Tyto Not my fault if he’s
soft in the head and wants to be
in here
GRIMBLE
No very true Jatt
Jatt gives Soren a little shove and then goes back to
supervise the others
JATT
Put your heads back owlets Your
beaks up Turn your faces to the

As they settle in a few owlets look up -- and soon all
the others join in Grimble watches Soren and Gylfie for
one more moment -- with a kind of focused menace --
withdraws

Gylfie directs Soren towards a spot under an

Think about how the air’1ll feel
ruffling your feathers and running
over your beak With your claws
tucked neatly underneath you

Soren and Gylfie quieten down -- but stand closer to one
another to feel each other’s warmth

MB 03 SAME SCENE - LATER MB 03

The moon completes its arc in the lightening sky The
owls are moved onwards from their places in the
glaucidium

JUTT
Alright owlets That’s enough
rest

As they’re marched out Soren notices the other owlets --
even the one who cried to be let out before -- look
slower less like themselves Zombies

Soren glances around everywhere to see if there’s some
way out but all he sees for now are levels and levels of
rocky plateaus and ledges all watched and guarded

shuttled down a passageway deep inside Soren and Gylfie

A weird sound starts to echo up into the passageway
Right before the passageway opens up to the Pelletorium

What’s that noise

I don’t think I want to find out

They reach the end of the passageway and it opens out
to

PELLETORIUM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Where they see a box canyon filled with ledges

Standing on the ledges hundreds of owls bob their heads

up and down over thousands of owls’ pellets This is the
source of the SOUND -- even weirder and sharper up close
as all these owls pick pick pick

At their station Soren and Gylfie’s boss is KLUMP --
Cockney greedy-seeming

KLUMP

I am Klump and it is my honor to
guide you in this glorious
Pelletorium These marvellous
pellets come from all over the owl
kingdoms We go through them and
we pick and we sort and we

Teeth bones

KLUMP
Ah yes Those go over here
(beat)
And feathers and fur go over
there

Not too far away a moonblinked owl picks up a Fleck a
little glowing piece of metal There is some excitement
Klump goes over to take it and bring it back

KLUMP
But what you must take care to
separate oh such care you must
take

She brings it back in her talon
KLUMP

Are these Our Lord the High Tyto
seeks these glorious Flecks

SOREN
Who is the Lord High Tyto Is he
here

KLUMP

Klump comes closer threateningly

KLUMP
Well One more night under the
moon should put a stop to that
(to Soren)

Take it Tyto and put it there
You all see where the Flecks
belong

around so all the

owlets can see)
You’re all watching

Klump points Soren towards the ledge Soren carries it
to

WP 04

THE LEDGE WP

Where there sits a scale one side holding a small pile
of Flecks in a leather pouch the other with bones to
measure the weight operated by an old gold-hued BAT

Soren hands the Fleck to the bat who takes it in his
gnarled and disgusting hand and places it on the scale

This Fleck does the trick and levels the scale

Being so close to this quantity of Flecks makes Soren
reel

The bat shoos him away and emits a high-pitched sound
Another BAT flies in from above It swoops down and
takes the pouch of Flecks into the air and out of the
Pelletorium

The bat dives into --

ANOTHER CAVERN

Where other bats are sorting Flecks by size We FOLLOW a
fruitbat as it takes a completed sack of Flecks and flies
off with it -- as more Bats return with empty sacks from
wherever it is they take them

The sky’s filled with them and we get a sense of the
vastness of the operation

BACK TO SCENE

Soren shakes off the effects of having been close to the
Flecks and recovers himself

The hole is carved into the floor of a chamber that’s
relatively luxurious by owl standards It’s decorated
with tapestries woven from the fur and feathers salvaged
from the pellets

Nyra Kludd and the Tytos Nyra designated “soldiers” are
looking down from their perches at the poor owlets in the
Pelletorium

their uses

As slaves As workers For too

Clogged our skies Choked our

too fast for us and for Soren to grasp each image we --

disoriented than anything else

something awful has happened He makes his way to the

EXT THE STONE PALACE - DUSK KB 01

At first we see a sandstone platform extending into dark
space

Nyra lands on it She is followed by a line of other
Tyto owls including Kludd with military precision

As it gets dark more bats arrive carrying sacks of
Flecks with them forms we recognize from St Aegolius

In the Beaks Slave owls can be seen doing the exhausting
work of enhancing large dents in the Beaks

standing he tries to catch sight of Metal Beak But

EXT ABOVE THE RIVER - GOLDEN JG 01

Twilight’s lute flies through the air -- and then Mrs
Plithiver pops her head out cautiously and then more
definitely as she comes to enjoy the air rushing over
her scales The fliers are heading over a stunning
landscape above the River Hoole

SOREN
Are you enjoying flying Mrs
Plithiver

MRS PLITHIVER

to her)

saw rows of Hagsfiends coming from
behind them too

Horrible creatures Half crow

DIGGER

They say they roam out in the
Beaks still

Diggers delivery hardly scares Soren or Gylfie

It was Lyze of Kiel who’d learned
the Hagsfiends’ weakness He led
the charge and those miserable
beasts withdrew to the canyons of
Perrock

We shouldn’t spend too much time
here talking about the Guardians
Not when we’re close not when
we could see them

faster at night if I can close my
wings for the day

Twilight subtly glances at Gylfie and Digger in case

Soren didn

‘t realize he was speaking for them

Of course I’m sure even Lyze of

horizon

TWILIGHT
But there is some time to go And
they say as he led the charge
against the Hagsfiends this was
the battle song that Lyze of Kiel
sang

Twilight starts to SING in a language we don’t
understand

Soren looks skeptical -- this is no song he’s heard but
it’s lovely Digger harmonizes

GYLFIE

One day Twilight I’1ll teach you

clambers down to the shore grabs a seashell calls up --

DIGGER
We must be close to the Sea
The shell moves -- a HERMIT CRAB scuttles out surprising
him

It’s not getting dark

It’s crows They billow around the fliers -- not meaning
harm But their intention is hard (for the fliers) to
read

ECHIDNA

This is not a region known for
being kind to snakes but welcome

MRS PLITHIVER
Who are you

ECHIDNA
This is my shore And I say who
may pass

In the bg Digger sets the hermit crab down It
scuttles a couple of inches away He moves to catch it
The Echidna looks irritated -- this is not respectful --
and Digger stands straight at attention

SOREN
‘The gate’ Da spoke of

know who you are

And I wish you luck

The hermit crab finally manages to scuttle away -- and
escape over the side of the rock

Digger looks disappointed but it shifts his focus to the
ocean It looks clear as glass

SOREN
We fly on this bearing

you will see Glaux

Twilight glances back to the shore -- barely visible

They’re better off flying on

So far we reached the black cloud
and the gate We’re in the mists
The tree must be on the other

Soren desperate flies ahead to see if there’s a way
out He makes out little flashes of patterns in the air
and the rain For just the briefest moment he sees a
path through the worst of the storm

SOREN

Can you fly in my wake

Digger and Gylfie nod At least the two smaller owls
don’t have to fly quite as hard as they did

He tries to brush them off but it’s pointless

He dips a little and feels how turbulent the currents are
below And he sees how violent the currents are in the

water too

TWILIGHT
We have to find the island

Soren bursts forward as best he can -- or tries He
can’t fly properly either

Soren feels his face freezing He blinks moves his beak
-- anything to keep it from happening

Mrs Plithiver is freezing up too getting heavier for
even Twilight to carry Then suddenly Digger can’t
take it anymore

DIGGER

Digger drops

Mrs P nearly falls out and he has to catch her -- and
then Gylfie who’s nearer to him drops too -- and

Twilight catches her His talons are now full

There’s a moment of desperate eye contact between
Twilight and Soren --

And Soren realizes it’s up to him to save Digger

The currents are fierce Soren’s blasted by gale forces
He tries hard to see Digger and when he has made him

sleet in the updraft he can

THE ISLAND OF GA’HOOLE AG 01
The tree is magical striking in an unexpected organic
ancient-looking way Stark against the wintry sky it

almost looks like rock as much as tree

Winter means it’s leafless but little points of light --
candles -- dot some of the branches

The tree takes up almost the whole island a gnarly
volcanic plug

Waves crash against its rocky shore

As they approach the tree two more Guardians emerge to
form a flank

They all fly in towards the tree’s entrance at its
base

something extraordinary wherever he looks -- whether
it’s the tree’s power system or its inhabitants’ studying

Meanwhile the tree’s normal inhabitants come out and
line the tree’s levels to take in these new arrivals
with sympathy and curiosity

Up ahead Boron and the other rescuing Guardians are
taking off their armor

BORON

SPEO -- a doctor an old gentlemanly burrowing owl --
flies down to join Boron Nurse-snakes join him He
puts his wing to Digger

Speo gestures and they all disappear into the healing
hollow --

SOREN is agape caught in the whirl of activity He
would happily stand here and just take it all in --
matron owls surround Soren and Gylfie and groom them
their bugs and grit washing off -- but he makes himself
remember why he’s here He says to everyone who passes

rummages through his things for a red stamp He puts the
stamp on the poem and looks up

enjoying himself in the battle

Twilight uses his lute to smash who he can

surveys the scene from high up on a mountainside He
holds the coal in his talon Trying not to be seen he
follows the edge of the mountainside as best he can
flying down towards a Fleck basket

He gets as near as he can without his gizzard failing and
drops his coal into the Fleck nest -- the little twigs
and kindling surrounding it catch on fire and burst into
flames

Soren is struck down by the power of the Flecks though

He tumbles skimming the rocky mountainside tangling in
its ferns and vines Still dazed he manages to fly to a
little area of vegetation just outside the perimeter of
the fleck towers He flies up and further away into a
nearby system of branches

And he recovers himself just in time to HEAR SOME LOUD

higher branch just in time -- as Kludd CRUNCHES the
branch below him

Almost every line is punctuated by Kludd CRUNCHING after
Soren -- it echoes the branching scene

nest so it’s taken care of and two monks tossing fire
to the third one to melt it too)

only to find himself surrounded by others There’s no

Until Barran like a vision emerges behind him She’s

The Fleck towers have been melted and the Guardians are
rising like Phoenixes -- a great sight to behold

Now that the Guardians have entered the fray Ezylryb
who is after all quite old allows himself a moment’s
rest nestled in a beak

From his position he looks over to the landing platform
of the Stone Palace Ezylryb is perplexed and curious
Ezylryb sees Nyra take off and fly into battle from it
