INT PARLOR - NIGHT
The curtains are drawn The room is dim

MAGGIE FOX and her sister KATE sit on opposite
sides of a bare table

SUPER New York 1870
The older sister is more substance The younger more style

Both are disarming Flashing eyes over twitching mouths

Their modest attire and stuffy surroundings offer an
illusion of tameness

But lions raised in captivity are still lions

Maggie pulls a hairpin from her dark tresses She holds it
in front of her face concentrates--

With a SNAP of her fingers the pin becomes a matchstick
She strikes it with her thumbnail

Lets it burn

Kates attention is focused on the front of her own dress

She arches her back--trying to emphasise the figure hidden
inside her conservative garment

The flame reaches Maggies fingertips

She drops the match on the tabletop and crushes the burnt
wood with the heel of her palm

aggie brushes the coarse ashes into her other hand

leans forward brings the cupped hand to her lips
inhales deeply--

Kate turns her face away as Maggie blows hard into her palm
Nothing

aggie opens her hand No ashes Just the hairpin

aggie flicks the pin at Kate

It bounces off her sisters chest and lands on the floor

Kate tugs a pin out of her own hair to return fire but--

DING DING DING
--a BELL mounted to the wall with a pull cord connecting it
to the next room puts an end to their games

Both women place their hands flat on the table Palms down
Their wrists positioned with care

q

The rooms only door swings open

Enter eldest sister LEAH FOX the ringmaster of this
spooky circus

She bears little resemblance to her much younger siblings

Leah is dull and dangerous The way a frying pan seems
innocuous right up until the moment it hits you

A frail woman follows Leah in

This is MRS ASHFORD (20s) The bags under her eyes are so
dark they make her widows weeds look grey by comparison

She clutches a short ornamental sword

Leah and the young widow take the two remaining seats on
either side of Maggie and Kate

Mrs Ashford lays the unsheathed sword on the table in front
of her with reverence

MRS ASHFORD
I need to reach my husband Vice
Admiral Peter Ashford

Maggie and Kate stay motionless Disengaged

LEAH
This is only your first visit As
gifted as my sisters are typically
several sittings are required
before a connection with a specific
spirit can be established

MRS ASHFORD
Thats why I brought his cutlass

She grabs it by the blade and rotates it so the hilt points
at Leah across from her

MRS ASHFORD (CONTD)
Its engraved with his name and
rank You see
LEAH
Still its very doubtful that
well reach him this evening Next
time--

MRS ASHFORD
But I--what I just gave you--that
was everything

Maggie shifts in her seat but she and Kate remain in
position Eyes down Mouths shut

LEAH
The size of the donation we request
is proportional to the demands on
my sisters time But if youd
prefer to consult with one of their
many imitators

MRS ASHFORD
No Please Youre the only ones I
trust I need to know if hes on
the other side

An awkward silence falls over the room Maggie gets her
first good look at the widow--

A greasy sheen at the roots of her hair Stains on her
wrinkled dress

Maggie nods at the sword

MAGGIE
(gently)
The war ended five years ago

MRS ASHFORD
Oh no he survived the war Not a
scratch on him So he didnt
qualify for a pension

The widow rubs a spot behind her ear compulsively--

MRS ASHFORD (CONTD)
He joined an expedition to the
Arctic seeking a faster route
through the Northwest Passage Its
been a year with no word His party
is presumed lost Trapped in the
drifting ice

--when her hand returns to the table the nail of her index
finger is stained red
Maggie leans back in her chair until she can see the angry
patch of skin the woman is gouging her way through

LEAH
Mrs Ashford--

MRS ASHFORD
I cant sleep I close my eyes and
its too bright Blinding And I
think--what if he was the last one
to die No one left to pray over
him or close his eyes How can he
cross over without a proper burial

She appeals directly to Maggie

MRS ASHFORD (CONTD)
I just need to know hes at peace
Waiting for me I beg you

Maggie looks to Kate for agreement
Kate looks to Leah for permission

Leah shifts the weight of her gaze between them First on
Kate who buckles under the pressure

Then Maggie who hardens

MAGGIE
Lets begin

rs Ashford places her hands flat on the table After a
last warning glance at Maggie Leah does the same

aggie and Kate shut their eyes Concentratinguntil
KNOCK KNOCK

rs Ashford GASPS

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
Eyes still closed a smile in her voice

MAGGIE
The spirits are anxious to speak
with you

MRS ASHFORD
Peter
MAGGIE
Is the spirit of Peter Ashford
present Rap three times

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
Mrs Ashfords eyes stream with bittersweet tears

The sword begins to JITTER The whole table trembles beneath
their hands

Then lifts

The widow looks at the floor All four table legs hover six
inches above it

MRS ASHFORD
Peter is it really you

The table SLAMS back down

Kates head drops onto her chest She convulses for several
seconds then--

Her hands remain on the table but the rest of her goes limp
slouched in her chair Unconscious

A long moment of silencebroken by a deep MOAN
It seems to come from the sword

MRS ASHFORD
Peter

RASPY MALE VOICE
Dearest

MRS ASHFORD
I found you

Something in the womans tone--

MRS ASHFORD (CONTD)
Show me the way Guide me

--makes Maggie open her eyes
The womans hands are on the sword

MAGGIE
No

Kates eyes fly open
She and Maggie both try to reach for the weapon--the table
jolts but their hands dont move

Mrs Ashford plunges the blade into her own torso

INT FOYER - LATER

Maggie and Kate watch from the upper landing of the homes
grand staircase

Below Leah confers with a man in rumpled clothes
She presses money into his hand

They both step aside to allow another man to roll Mrs
Ashford out the front door

Not on a stretcher In a wheelchair

With a blanket wrapped around her head and shoulders Just
an infirm woman bundled up against the cold

Until the wheels go over the threshold
The chair lurches The blanket shifts
Mrs Ashfords head falls backwards

With her face upside down her dead eyes stare directly up
at the sisters

Kate winces Maggie retreats into the nearby
BEDROOM
where she unbuttons her cuffs and rolls back her sleeves

Here lies the secret to their table-lifting trick--and their
inability to thwart the widows suicide

Maggie has flat steel bars strapped to the underside of her
forearms Each bar ends in a small hook beneath her wrists

The hooks are positioned to catch the edge of the table and
painted black to hide among the frills of her dark dress

Maggie undoes the leather straps that hold the devices in
place as Kate enters

KATE
Do you think those policemen will
want to talk to us
MAGGIE
Policemen wear uniforms now
remember

Maggie throws down her table-lifters in disgust

She drops to her knees to reach under the bed Then drags
out and opens a large trunk

KATE
What are you doing

Maggie crosses to a wardrobe She grabs armfuls of clothes
and tosses them at the trunk

KATE (CONTD)
You cant leave

Kate intercepts one of the flying items
KATE (CONTD)

You definitely cant take the shawl
you borrowed with you

AGGIE
Im packing for both us you
wool-brained goose

Kate glances back at the doorway and lowers her voice

KATE
You know we cant

AGGIE

(full-volume)
Why not Shes old enough to be our
mother but thats her only real
claim to authority over us

KATE

If it wasnt for her wed still be
back in Hydesville with pig shit on
our heels and a baby on each--

She chokes on the words as a hand grips the back of her
neck Maggie looks up to see Leah behind Kate

MAGGIE
Better shit on our heels than blood
on our hands

Leahs grip on Kates neck becomes a shoulder-squeeze
LEAH
You see now why I advised against
contact tonight

MAGGIE
You only wanted to wring more money
out of her You would have had us
perform eventually

LEAH
So it was inevitable then And
incurable Making this tantrum even
more pointless than usual

Maggie pulls Kate away from Leah She tugs back Kates
sleeve to expose the hook at her wrist

MAGGIE
(to Kate)
Tell me you still feel good about
what were doing

KATE
feel likewere very good at
t

I
i

LEAH
How bad can it be Most of it
evolved from pranks you played as
children The spirits used to
tell Momma and Poppa--rest their
souls--to put more syrup on your
porridge

MAGGIE
That was a long time ago Before
you spun it into all this

Leahs face darkens

LEAH
And if I hadnt There are worse
things to happen to strange little
girls in backwater towns I kept
you from getting mixed in with the
kindling

Maggie waves at the lavish furnishings around them

MAGGIE
Well weve certainly paid you back
over the years
LEAH
And under my careful management
all those pennies put you through
school Put this roof over your
head You never wanted for
anything Youve asked and Ive
given

MAGGIE
Were done asking

LEAH
(to Kate)
Where would you go What would you
do

MAGGIE
She needs us Katy This is a
chance to chart our own course for
once in our lives

Kate looks from one sister to the other Bites her lip

MAGGIE (CONTD)
We can do this Its time

Kate tosses her shawl into the trunk

INT THEATER - NIGHT

A hundred faces None of them kind

Every seat is occupied

Members of the citys upper crust fill the front rows

The lower classes occupy the rear gallery and the aisles
where purchasers of standing tickets line the walls

Among them a cluster of newspapermen already scribbling
All settle as the THEATER MANAGER appears on stage

With the puffed-out chest and rhythm of a carnival barker

THEATER MANAGER
Ladies and gentlemen Appearing for
the first time in public since
their confession made headlines
across the globe--here to present
proof in the flesh--the famous--the
fraudulent--the Fox Sisters

No applause Nothing

He withdraws to the wings Leaving the stage empty until
Maggie and Kate enter

Slow Cautious

Kate lingers upstage near the curtain

Alone Maggie advances to the stages apron Silent in her
stocking feet

When shes front and center she grabs her skirt and raises
the hem to mid-calf

Theres a flutter of GASPS and CREAKS as audience members
lean forward in their seats Then stillness again

Now a DOCTOR in a white coat CLOMPS out from the wings
He positions himself beside Maggie
Looks her up and down

His spectacles reflect the gaslights at the stages edge
Two blazing circles above the hard line of his mouth

He signals Maggie to raise her dress higher She
obeys--revealing her legs to just below the knee

oD

he crowd inhales the last of the air from the room

he Doctor waves a hand for Maggie to begin
She doesnt move But--
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

he spectators grow more and more restless with each KNOCK

he Doctor kneels--his face now inches from Maggies legs

oD

his fresh humiliation draws the color to her cheeks but she
continues KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

Close inspection of Maggies feet reveals the joint of her
big toe rising and--

KNOCK
--slamming down against the wooden platform
aggie repeats the action with her other foot

The big toe joint rolls up and over unnaturally until its
almost on top of the one next to it

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
The Doctor grimaces and stands to deliver his verdict

DOCTOR
The rappings are the result of
near-perfect control of the muscles
which govern the tendons in the
foot

A CHORUS of disbelief mingled with DISGUST from the crowd

DOCTOR (CONTD)
Presumably developed in childhood
before the muscles stiffened and
practiced rigorously ever since

It wasnt a question but Maggie nods anyway
A TRUE BELIEVER in the second row gets to his feet

TRUE BELIEVER
This proves nothing And
personally I resent the
implication that I cant
differentiate between miracles of
the spirit world and creaky toes

TITTERS from the audience

DOCTOR

The human ear is deceptive sir
Tap two coins together above the
head of a blindfolded man and hell
struggle to discern exactly where
the noise originates

A HECKLER in sooty trousers standing in the aisle

HECKLER
Dont ask her for a demonstration
anyone Youll never see those
coins again

More than a few LAUGHS now One of the hecklers pals grabs
his crotch and yells to Maggie

HECKLER 2
Ive got a job that pays two bits
Wont even need the blindfold

HOOTS and WHISTLES
Maggie throws her hem back down

Upstage Kate bristles She thrusts her clenched fists into
the pockets of her own voluminous skirt

TRUE BELIEVER
Some of the greatest minds in our
country have vouched for these
phenomena

MAGGIE
The educated mind makes more
assumptions than the uneducated
one That just makes it easier to
fool

BOOS and JEERS

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Its only natural to thirst for the
marvelous But very rarely is it
wise to drink

NEWS PAPERMAN
Why reveal everything now After
all these years

Maggie looks back to share a guilty look with Kate

MAGGIE
Weve come to realize that a lack
of good intentions may be just as
harmful as an abundance of bad
ones

More BOOS
MAGGIE (CONTD)
My sister and I helped create the
Spiritualist movement Its evolved
over the years to take on many
different forms But all require
little more than devilish ingenuity
and dim light I can only assure

you--there are no spirits

HECKLER
Nobody wants assurances from the
monkeys Wheres the organ grinder

This gets him his biggest LAUGH yet

MAGGIE
Weve had no contact with our
sister Leah since our decision to
speak the truth But her silence
now is its own confession

TRUE BELIEVER
You are a liar madam

MAGGIE
Yes I am Thats what Im trying
to tell you

TRUE BELIEVER
And youre lying now

MAGGIE
No Im--

TRUE BELIEVER
Your shameful tricks pale in
comparison to events Ive witnessed
with my own eyes Spirit lights
The materialization of--

A woman in the audience SCREAMS in terror
Followed by more SCREAMS and GASPS from the crowd

All eyes are on Kate Maggie turns

Kate still faces the audienceoblivious to the luminous
disembodied face hovering above her right shoulder

Even more horrible than the face is its VOICE

Genderless Ageless Unearthly

SPIRIT VOICE
The dead do not return Nor any
that go down into Hell

Maggie rolls her eyes
Kate sashays forward to join Maggie front and center
The glowing face bobs along behind her

SCREAMS from the audience mingle with cries of WITCH
DEMON and from one squinting OLD MAN

OLD MAN
Agnes

MAGGIE
(to Kate)
Very subtle

Kates lips stay frozen in a smile The collar of her dress
hides the vibration in her throat as she throws her voice so
her response comes from the ghostly face

KATE
What That seemed like my cue

MAGGIE
(to audience)
Dont be alarmed Its just a wire
mask Covered in gauze and coated
with phosphorous paint

The face dips down to the floor and soars back up--this time
in front of Kate

A HUSH falls over the crowd as they realize the mask is
mounted to a thin telescopic rod

So thin that even now as Kate waves it back and forth its
almost invisible

KATE
Most are content with just a voice
But for those who demand more

Kate collapses the rod until its no longer than a pencil
She traces the contours of the gauze face with her fingers

KATE (CONTD)
We use the same mask every time
People see who they need to see

The embarrassment and confusion in the room become RAGE
A tidal wave of hateful energy

Heckler 2 came prepared He withdraws a wilted cabbage from
his jacket pocket and hurls it at Kate

It strikes the mask bursting on impact

Chaos erupts Another man in the aisle rushes forward

The Theater Manager reappears just in time to stop him from
mounting the stage

Everyones out of their seats The JEERS and CATCALLS are
deafening

NT BACKSTAGE - LATER

The sisters wait in the cramped dressing room

The only furniture--a small fainting couch--is littered with
old props So they stand

And they listen
Muffled THREATS and YELLING drift through the door

They both jump as it CRASHES open

The Theater Manager enters with a handful of crumpled bills
Maggie takes the money from him and begins to count it

Selecting a petticoat from a jumble of costumes on the floor
to mop the sweat from his brow

THEATER MANAGER
I wouldnt try going back to your
hotel tonight girlies Theyre
still pretty riled up out there

KATE
Where are we supposed to sleep

He graciously waves his arm at their packed surroundings

KATE
There isnt even a bed Ora
toilet

He roots through the costume pile againhands her a Roman
centurions helmet
Maggie frowns down at their profit

MAGGIE
This is less than we agreed

He counts the deductions off on his fingers

THEATER MANAGER
My cut The good doctors fee
Property damage

MAGGIE
But this isnt enough

THEATER MANAGER
Nearest workhouse is Blackwells
Island Id get down there bright
and early if I were you Get a head
start on all the other mediums
you just put outta business

KATE
Workhouse Were the Fox Sisters

She returns the helmet with an indignant shove

KATE (CONTD)
New York paid good money to see us
come clean and there are plenty
more states in the Union

THEATER MANAGER
Your lives are your own to risk I
suppose

KATE
Thats being a little overly
dramatic dont you think Even for
a man in your line of work

THEATER MANAGER
Are you familiar with the
expression A lie travels halfway
around the world while the truth is
still putting on its shoes

KATE
Whats your point
THEATER MANAGER
Well in your case the truths
going barefoot and running like its
ass is on fire People living in
mud huts on the banks of the
Mississippi are gonna know what
happened here tonight before the
inks dry on tomorrows paper

KATE
So

THEATER MANAGER
So if you thought this crowd was
ugly--

He waggles his fingers over the helmets opening

THEATER MANAGER (CONTD)
--wait until they come in already
knowing where you really pull the
rabbits from

Kate looks to her sister for backup

MAGGIE
Hes right

The Theater Manager raises the helmet up like a religious
offering then bows low and sets it at Kates feet

THEATER MANAGER
Its a marvelous new age were
living in eh girls God bless the
transcontinental telegraph

He chuckles and leaves

Kate kicks the helmet so--

BAM

--it hits the door closing behind him

KATE
As if were just going to slink off
and join the unwashed Weve
entertained heads of state
captains of industry They sought
our advice And they took it
MAGGIE
Only because they thought it was
coming from dead presidents

KATE
It was still good advice Anyway
it doesnt change the fact that we
know some of this countrys most
influential citizens

MAGGIE
And we just made total fools of all
of them

Kate throws her hands up

KATE
So what if its fake There are
people making a good living doing
our same tricks--half as well and
for twice the price The only
difference is they call themselves
illusionists

AGGIE
The difference is theyre men

Maggie tallies the bills again

AGGIE (CONTD)
Theres enough here to get us
abroad at least

KATE
But hardly anyone knows us abroad
AGGIE
Thats the idea
KATE
Your last idea got cabbage in my
hair
AGGIE
We have to leave Its not safe for
us here
KATE

Whos fault is that

AGGIE
You could always go back to Leah

KATE
After this Shed sooner kill me
and you damn well know it
(her own words sink in)
You said we were only doing this
for the money

Maggie shrugs picks at some lint on her dress

AGGIE
It was also the right thing to do

KATE

It was spitting in Leahs face I
crossed this bridge with you and
the first thing you did was set
fire to it behind us

Kate stomps over to the couch and sweeps off all the props

Some of them break on impact with the floor The rest she
stomps on in the process of sitting down

She closes her eyes and massages her temples

KATE
Im getting somethinga
visionCould it bethe future
IAGGIE

Should be easy enough to tell Are
we standing in line for gruel

KATE
thinkyesIm definitely
seeing something

AGGIE
The inside of your eyelids

KATE

ts getting clearer and clearer
with every word you speak
tsits

Her eyes fly open

KATE (CONTD)
A solo act

Maggie LAUGHS

Kate crosses her arms Digs her heels in

The laughter dies in Maggies throat

EXT RMS OCEANIC - NIGHT

The huge steamship glides east across the Atlantic

INT SHIPS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Near the doorway that leads to the dining room members of
staff huddle over a newspaper

A sketched portrait of Maggie and Kate graces the front page
beneath the headline

Swindle Sisters to Set Sail

They compare Maggies likeness to that of a woman in the
SECOND CLASS DINING ROOM

Its crammed full of respectable middle-class travelers
And at a table set for ten--

Maggie Alone

The other passengers stare at her openly and WHISPER between
SLURPS of their soup course

Maggie keeps her eyes down
Focused on the still-empty space between her own utensils

At last a hand enters her vision and drops a bowl of soup in
front of her Most of the reddish broth slops over the side
and blooms on the white tablecloth beneath it

The waiter is gone in a blur But his abruptness catches the
attention of his supervisor--

The HEAD WAITER rushes to Maggies side drawing even more
stares to her table

He snaps up a napkin from one of the unused place settings

MAGGIE
Its alright Really

He flutters around her dabbing at the spill and shoots a
warning look at the door to the kitchen

he staff huddle now includes the suspect waiter They peer
out at Maggie Their faces inscrutable

A long gray noodle bobs to the surface of Maggies bowl

Wn

he takes up her soup spoon and attempts to fish it out--it
slithers back into the murky broth

She gets the spoon underneath something more substantial
lifts it up

he tapered noodle hangs over the side dangling from a
ragged clump of fur

And two hind legs

She drops the spoon--and the severed rat rump--back into the
bowl with a CLATTER

The Head Waiter looks to the kitchen again in horror The
plotters have all disappeared

He returns his attention to Maggie
Hes not the only one The big round table is a spotlight

Maggie gets up but fights the urge to hurry She walks out
of the room with her shoulders back

INT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Maggie withdraws a key from her skirt pocket
She unlocks the door to her

CABIN

and locks it again behind her

It takes a moment for her eyes to adjust from the well-lit
hallway to the dark room

Directly across from the door is a circle of lighter
darkness where moonlight enters the rooms single porthole

Underneath it is her trunk An unlit gas lamp on the lid

q

To her left--a wash stand with pitcher and bowl alongside a
small writing table and chair

q

To her right a curtain on a ceiling rail is drawn across to
conceal the sleeping berths

Maggie crosses to the trunk and gropes the surface for the
matchbox- -

A match is struck But not by her

Behind the curtain

She yanks the fabric aside
Kate is on the upper bunk lighting a small opium pipe

Maggie grabs the pipe out of her sisters hand and throws it
across the room

KATE
You didnt have to do that

Maggie takes the box of matches from Kate Lights the lamp

MAGGIE
Of all the things to spend money
on

KATE

Its medicinal Travelings always
been hard on my nerves Even before
I was an object of national scorn

Maggie undresses for bed

KATE (CONTD)
How was dinner Did it seem like
anyone recognized you

Maggies buttons suddenly require her full attention

KATE (CONTD)
I hate this room We might as well
be back on the farm Stacked up
like firewood

Her dress removed Maggie goes to unhook her under corset

One of the tapered whalebones that give it its rigid shape
has worn through the fabric casing near her waist

She picks at the tip of exposed bone with her fingernail
then removes the corset with a sigh

MAGGIE
At least we have our own beds

Stripped to her chemise she crawls into the lower bunk
MAGGIE (CONTD)
We just have to make it across the
Atlantic Another week and well be
in a new country with cheese older
than our transgressions

KATE
Do you remember our last trip
abroad

MAGGIE
Do you

KATE

I remember we traveled First Class
And I remember the sitting we did
for Baronet Something-or-Other The
one who was so thrilled to speak
with Ben Franklin

Maggie waits for the familiar punch line
In a baritone flawless British accent

KATE (CONTD)
My wordMr Franklin is
surprisingly lacking in good
grammar

Maggie reaches for the lamp and puts out the light
SCRATCH SCRATCH
The sound is faint Muffled by the walls

KATE
Do you hear that

MAGGIE
Im asleep

SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH

KATE
That What is that

Maggie stares into the darkness

MAGGIE
Rats

INT CABIN - NIGHT

Maggie wakes to the sound of Kate COUGHING
The room is hazy with smoke

Maggie rolls out of bed onto the floor

She lands on her belly her face inches from apair of bare
feet beneath the hem of a nightgown

Maggie grabs the ankle closest to her--

MAGGIE
Katy

--and jerks her hand back in pain

The feet are scalding hot to the touch

Maggie looks up straining to see the figure standing
motionless above her through the smoke

Theres a burst of hacking COUGHS and then--

--Kate falls out of bed Maggie is SLAMMED into the floor as
Kate lands on top of her

KATE
Maggie Mag--

Kates cries devolve into retches She rolls off her sister
Maggie gets onto her hands and knees Gropes for Kates arm
Together they crawl toward the door It wont open

Maggie has to unlock the door She pushes Kate through

As she crosses the threshold into the corridor she sucks in
a lungful of clean air and screams

MAGGIE
Fire Fiiirre

INT CORRIDOR - LATER
Kate and Maggie huddle outside their closed cabin door
Passengers in varying states of undress litter the hall

Most stare unabashedly at the sisters including the
occupant of the cabin next door

Their neighbor an overly-groomed bachelor wears a garish
monogrammed robe open over matching pajamas

Kate smiles coyly at him and shivers in her thin nightgown
He belts the robe

The door to the sisters cabin opens A smirking ships
officer steps out into the hall followed by CAPTAIN PIKE

Hes weathered Sturdy Everything about him elicits polite
distance Like a good fence

Maggie knows whats coming Preemptively

MAGGIE
The room was filled with smoke You
can still smell it

CAPTAIN PIKE
Yes You can

He holds out Kates opium pipe

CAPTAIN PIKE
Id encourage you ladies to utilize
the second class smoking room for
future enjoyment of tobacco
products

Kate snatches the pipe back

CAPTAIN PIKE
(to everyone)
Theres no fire You can all return
to your beds

GROANS and MUTTERS from the other passengers

Further down the corridor a man sporting a life vest over
his long johns is loudly admonished by his WIFE

WIFE
Told ya didnt I Damn fool

He sheepishly returns to their cabin
The Captain and the smirking officer turn to leave

KATE
We heard rats in the walls earlier

CAPTAIN PIKE
Thats the thing about rats--the
clever ones find their way into the
most civilized places

Kate gears up for a reprisal Maggie pulls her back into the
CABIN
before they can make any more of a scene

Inside Maggie leans against the door Kate sits on the
bottom bunk with the pipe in her hand

KATE
Theres no way this made all that
smoke

MAGGIE
I know

KATE

(half-joking)
Maybe the spirits are angry with
us

AGGIE
Spirits arent real

KATE
Ours werent

AGGIE
We have enough enemies still among
the living to worry about

KATE
You think someone did this to us on
purpose How could they

(off Maggies look)
I mean I know how they could want
to do it But how did they manage
it
IAGGIE

How would we do it

KATE
Fake a fire Thats a nasty trick
Even for us

AGGIE
But if we had to--its possible

Kate considers

KATE
I know how Id do it

FLASH TO
KATES VISUALIZATION OF HER PLAN
Kate is alone in the sisters cabin
She has their wash basin turned over in her lap

KATE (VO)
Id need a drill

A hand-powered drill appears beside her

She turns the crank to bore a hole in the basins center
In Kates imagination the drill makes the same--
SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH

--attributed to the rats earlier

KATE (VO)
Something to burn

Maggie enters with a wicker wastebasket and a metal pail
While Kate drills Maggie breaks the wicker into pieces
The broken wicker goes into the pail Maggie sets it alight

KATE (VO)
Oh and some rubber tubing The
kind doctors use

Kate finishes with the drill She opens their trunk and
TADA--a nice long coil of medical tubing

Kate inserts one end of it into the hole in the basin

She places the turned-over basin on top of the pail
smothering the fire

Smoke is channeled up through the rubber tube

KATE (VO)
The thing is--whoever I wanted to
smoke out would have to be close
The closer the better

In Kates mind she and Maggie open the door of their cabin

and poke their heads into the
CORRIDOR
to check the coast is clear

They run the tubing along the floor

flush with the wall

and stick the end under the door of the next cabin down

Maggie and Kate return to their own

CABIN

with the tube running under their closed door

Maggie kneels beside it

Kate presses her ear to the shared wall Waiting for

COUGHING from next door

Kate signals Maggie who reels the tube back inside their

own cabin

KATE
So

AGGIE
Pretty good

KATE
Good I figured it out

AGGIE
That would explain a lot

KATE

BACK TO REALITY

It explains everything Honestly
people are so busy hating us for
all the things we did when they
ought to be thanking us for all the

things we never even tried

Maggies face is dark

KATE

What What are you thinking

MAGGIE

Did you recognize anyone out in the

corridor just now

Kate shakes her head

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Neither did I

KATE
Not many people could pull off a
trick like that

MAGGIE
Not many people are devious enough
to think up a trick like that in
the first place

Kate makes a snotty face in response to the dig

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Were trapped on this ship for the
next week Everyone knows who we
are We need to turn the tables

KATE
I thought our table-manipulating
days were behind us

Maggie shoos Kate off her bed with an annoyed wave

As Kate clambers up into her own bunk Maggie looks at her
sisters perfect unmarked feet

then at the burn blisters forming on her own hand

EXT UPPER DECK - DAY

Maggie and Kate linger near the entrance to the bridge
where a trio of HELMSMEN are at the ships controls

Just past the threshold between where the sisters stand and
where the men work is a door marked Chart Room

MAGGIE
Keep them occupied as long as you
can I need enough time to find the
passenger manifest and check it for
any names I recognize

KATE
Why cant I do that while you
distract them
MAGGIE
How are you going to recognize
anything You never remember
anyones name Not even Baronet
Something-Or-Other

Before Kate can protest Maggie nudges her forward onto the

BRIDGE
where she embraces the role with gusto

KATE
So this is where all the men in
uniform are hiding

HELMSMAN 1
You cant be in here

She sashays around him--

KATE
Ooh thats a big instrument

--to the large compass mounted on the console
All three men turn to stop her

Maggie seizes her opportunity

She sneaks into the

CHART ROOM

where she realizes theres another connecting door

T
door to the mystery room isnt labelled
M

She silently picks through books and ledgers while
ON THE BRIDGE
Kate is all smiles and evasive maneuvers

HELMSMAN 2
You need to leave Now

KATE
Do you know who I am

he Chart Room is sandwiched between the Bridge and

The

aggie tiptoes to a desk in the center of the Chart Room

They all nod Judging by the matching grim expressions on
their faces they know exactly who she is

KATE (CONTD)
But do you know what I can do

She toys with a strand of her hair

HELMSMAN 1
(exasperated)
What

KATE
Im a woman I can turn your whole
world upside down

She waves a hand over the ships compass
The sailors jaws drop as the needle spins from NE to SW
BACK IN THE CHART ROOM

Maggie has the passenger log open She finds her own name
and Kates Runs her finger down the page

Frowns
Sudden YELLING from the bridge startles her

Maggie abandons the log and creeps back to the door she came
in Now theres SILENCE

Maggie holds her breath Listens hard
A hand grabs her shoulder

Maggie SCREAMS

She whirls around to see--

The Captain The door to the mystery room open behind him

INT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

A red-faced Maggie speeds through the labyrinth of hallways
Kate struggles to keep up

KATE
How was I supposed to know theyd
get so upset

AGGIE

Theyre sailors in the middle of
the Atlantic How else would they
react to their compass going
haywire

KATE
All you said was distract them
You didnt say how

She dangles her wrist out in front of her to shake a metal
bangle free of her sleeve

KATE (CONTD)
And Id already gone to the trouble
of magnetizing my bracelet

Maggie stops without warning She doubles back to the
SECOND CLASS DINING ROOM

KATE
What Are we eating

Maggie scans the passengers enjoying lunch from the
doorwaythen carries on down the hall

KATE
Who are you looking for Did you
recognize any names

IAGGIE
No

KATE
Great So were on the Captains
naughty list again for nothing

AGGIE
Not exactly

KATE
Where are we going This isnt the
way back to our cabin

Maggie comes to a stop again outside the
SECOND CLASS LOUNGE

where clusters of travellers socialize at small tables
Including agroup of men playing poker

She moves herself and Kate back from the doorway

MAGGIE
I need your powers of distraction
again

KATE
But --

MAGGIE

Ill be more specific this time

INT LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER
Kate enters alone She beelines for a bookshelf

Keeping her back to the room she pretends to peruse the
meager library available to passengers

ost of the books are worn and at least one issticky

KATE
Ugh Second Class

Kate risks a glance over her shoulder No one has noticed
her Yet

She selects the thickest book and carries it toward a table
of ladies playing whist in the corner

One player spots Kate and WHISPERS to the others

Kate smiles warmly as she approaches Until she gets to
their table--

Her eyes suddenly bulge
She raises a shaky finger to point at something behind them
In a terrified whisper

KATE
Lincolns ghost

The ladies all turn to follow Kates finger

Nothing there but a potted plant

They turn back to Kate

She clutches the book to her chest with one hand and salutes
in the direction of the plant with the other

Mission accomplished Kate spins on her heels

She leaves them shaking their heads and returns to the
CORRIDOR
where Maggie waits

Kate opens the book Tucked inside are the items she swiped
from the whist players

Their score-keeping pencil and one playing card

KATE
None of them even fainted People
are so much harder to shock these
days I blame the Worlds Fair

Maggie uses the pencil to scrawl something on the card

GROANS and MILD CURSES drift out from the men in the lounge
as their current poker hand comes to an end

The sisters peek inside

The BACHELOR--last seen in a hideous robe outside the cabin
next door to their own--shuffles the cards

Kate wrinkles her nose

KATE
I know its probably my
imagination but I feel like I can
smell his cologne from here

Maggie hands her the pencil back The card has vanished

MAGGIE
Wait here

She leaves Kate in the hall enters the

LOUNGE

and walks straight up to the poker table

Maggie takes a position just behind the Bachelor

MAGGIE
Good afternoon gentlemen

A few of them SNICKER

The Bachelor turns around long enough to sneer at Maggie
then returns to shuffling the cards

MAGGIE
I believe you and I met briefly in
the corridor last night but we
werent properly introduced

In a clipped English accent

BACHELOR
No point I already knew who you
were

MAGGIE

And your name
He ignores her Goes to deal--

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Have it your way

--she grabs the deck of cards out of his hands

BACHELOR
What the devil do you think youre
doing
Maggie TSK TSKS
MAGGIE

Never tell the audience whats
going to happen next

She clutches the cards to her chest Rolls her eyes back in
her head

MAGGIE
Spirits The name of the man who
booked the cabin adjoining mine

Maggie throws all the cards up--

--and plucks a single card out of the air

The rest flutter down onto the men the table the floor
Maggie holds out the card she selected Flips it over

The mens annoyance becomes awe

I

he Bachelor cranes his neck to see His eyes go wide

I

heres a name scrawled across the cards face

I

hen he reads the name and sneers again
BACHELOR
Arthur Henshaw All this bother
and thats not even my bloody name

MAGGIE
I know You were wearing a
monogrammed robe the last time I
saw you So unless youre a
clothing thief with the worlds
worst taste in pajamas your
initials are Wd

A few of the men CHUCKLE at his expense this time

MAGGIE (CONTD)
The spirits can be so literal
sometimes They gave the name of
the man listed on the passenger
manifest But as you just

said--thats not your name

The mood around the table grows serious

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Travelling under a false identity
Not the sort of man Id trust to
shuffle the deck

BACHELOR
Youve got some nerve accusing me
of questionable behavior

The other men eye him with suspicion

BACHELOR (CONTD)
Henshaw or whoever he was--I never
got his name--he was shouting to
one of the porters about wanting to
change cabins I overheard and
agreed to swap with him

Straightening the gambling money in front of him

BACHELOR (CONTD)
Provided he compensate me for the
inconvenience

He surveys the mess of cards

BACHELOR (CONTD)
I should have asked for more

MAGGIE
He paid you to switch rooms Why

The Bachelor turns so he can look square at Maggie

BACHELOR
My understanding was there was
something about the view he didnt
like

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

The poker players LAUGHTER follows Maggie out

KATE
Well Is he the one behind the fire
hoax

IAGGIE

I dont know I dont think so No
one in our line of work would be so
startled by a little sleight of
hand And he had an explanation for
the name being different

KATE
What explanation

AGGIE
Nothing It doesnt matter

Kate throws down the book she borrowed with an exaggerated
SIGH Theres a gold crucifix on the cover

KATE
What now

Maggie stoops to pick up the book

MAGGIE
Go back to the room

KATE
Where are you going

MAGGIE
Just do as youre told

Maggie takes a deep breath Holds up the Bible

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Please sister Have a little faith
in me

INT CHAPEL - MOMENTS LATER

The midday sermon is in progress when Maggie enters led by
the ships CHAPLAIN

He paces stiffly back and forth one hand raised up to the
ceiling with the elbow at a perfect right angle A paper
doll come to life

CHAPLAIN
The Lord instructs us Strive for
peace with everyone See to it that
no root of bitterness springs up
and causes trouble and by it many
become defiled

Theres an open spot at the end of a pew near the back
Maggie goes to sit down--

A man already in the pew recognizes her and slides over
Toward her No more room

CHAPLAIN (CONTD)
If your brother sins rebuke him
and if he repents forgive him

Maggie stands awkwardly at the rear of the room

CHAPLAIN (CONTD)
Even if he sins against you seven
times in the day saying I
repent you must forgive him seven
times

The Chaplain looks up from his sermon He spots Maggie

CHAPLAIN (CONTD)
But what if your brother is
unrepentant The good book tells us
Fret notfor the evildoers shall
be cut off

His focus lingers on her
The many heads of the congregation turn to follow his

CHAPLAIN (CONTD)

Peter 58--The devil prowls around

like a roaring lion looking for
someone to devour

gazeuntil Maggie bears the full weight of their scrutiny

Finally the Chaplain raises both hands and lowers his head

Parishioners make the sign of the cross and file out

One man missing a leg--but with two perfectly good

CHAPLAIN (CONTD)
God be with you

eyes--jams his crutch down on Maggies foot on his way past

She curses under her breath

When everyone but Maggie has left

His smile

CHAPLAIN
Miss Fox

is permanent Glued on

MAGGIE
Im glad you know my name Its
been so long since Ive had to
offer it to anyone I sometimes
think Ill forget what it is

CHAPLAIN
Not to worry There are plenty of
us around with better memories

Maggie affixes her own fake smile

They both
She holds

CHAPLAIN
What brings a person such as
yourself to our floating house of
worship

MAGGIE
Curiosity

CHAPLAIN
Come to witness a real religion at
work

fake-laugh at his not-joke

up the Bible she brought with her

MAGGIE
My parents were Methodist God rest
their souls

CHAPLAIN
Rest being the operative word
Much more peaceful than rearranging
furniture

MAGGIE
I wondered about the former
Spiritualists filling your pews on
this voyage

CHAPLAIN
Its true many are returning to the
flock But most have the good sense
not to admit having left it in the
first place

MAGGIE
Isnt confession typically
encouraged in real religions

CHAPLAIN
Yes But then honesty comes easily
to so few of usdont you find

MAGGIE
Thats why my curiosity brings me
to you Who better to give me an
honest answer

CHAPLAIN
Ill certainly try

MAGGIE
Has anyone expressed hostility
toward Spiritualism in generalor

my sister and I in particular
(off his look)
Beyond the expected

CHAPLAIN
Perhaps its better not to dwell on
the mountain of animosity still to
be overcome It can only discourage
you from your journey The road to
redemption is a long one--paved
with much more than veracity

MAGGIE
Is that so

He gets close to her Too close
Looks her dead in the eye

His smile doesnt soften his words It sharpens them

CHAPLAIN
Hebrews 124--In your struggle
against sin you have not yet
resisted to the point of shedding
your blood

Maggies courage wavers
The Chaplain bursts out LAUGHING

CHAPLAIN (CONTD)
Now Im the one who must
confess--Im guilty of indulging in
a little dramatic flourish from
time to time

MAGGIE
Thats another thing we have in
common then

CHAPLAIN
Was there something else

She nods to a carving of the crucified Jesus that hangs on
the wall behind him

MAGGIE
Speaking for the dead of course

A corner of his smile comes unstuck

CHAPLAIN
I dont preach for profit

Maggie spies a collection plate on the lectern More metal
than paper inside

MAGGIE
I can see that Allow me

She moves past him sets her Bible down withdraws a coin
purse from her skirt pocket--

--drops a penny in

CHAPLAIN
Very generous of you Miss Fox
Especially considering how tenuous
your own circumstances must be at
present

Maggie SNAPS the purse closed

CHAPLAIN
Are youquite alright

MAGGIE
My personal finances are none of
your concern

CHAPLAIN
I meantits just thatI can
see your breath

Maggie exhales Hes right Her breath fogs the air
His doesnt
She looks down at her handscovered in gooseflesh

The ambient temp surrounding Maggie is suddenly freezing
while the Chaplain six feet away is unaffected

All her bravado gone Maggie hurries out of the chapel

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Maggie turns a corner And another
And another

She pauses to get her bearings Picks up the pace Rounds a
few more corners The distance between them gets shorter

And the doors

There are frames But no doors inside them

Then the frames disappear Only endless blank wall

Maggie goes back the way she came Stops at a T-junction
with no signs No distinguishing features

She whips around more corners

At last she reaches a corridor so long and straight it must
go somewhere

Maggie proceeds down this new hallway
SSSHHH SHHHH SSSHHH

She stops The sound stops with her
Maggie starts walking again--

SSSHHH SHHH SSSHHH

Its the fabric of her skirt brushing against the wall on
either side of her as the corridor narrows

And still no doors

She turns around to go back About fifty feet behind her--
A hooded man

Perfectly still Looking right at her

Dressed head-to-toe in heavy canvas lined with fur Face
obscured by a scarf and snow goggles

An ice axe dangles from one of his gloved hands

Water drips from the spiked end and puddles beside his
snow-caked boots

He raises the axe
Maggies breath catches in her throat

The figure bursts into a full-speed charge

Maggie flees in terror Running as
the corridor narrows

and narrows

until

choke point

Less than a foot wide Maggie turns sideways to get through
--gets stuck instead

Hes almost to her

She shuts her eyes Grits her teeth Uses all her strength
to force herself through wincing as her breasts are crushed
against her
44

She makes it to the other side where the hallway widens
again The narrow gap now keeps her attacker at bay

Hes wedged in on his side
The arm with the axe juts through trying to reach her

Maggie runs hard away from him until she comes to another
T-junction She turns without looking and slams into--

The Chaplain

CHAPLAIN
There you are

He has the Bible she left behind

CHAPLAIN (CONTD)
Really Miss Fox You must try to
keep a tighter grip on your
salvation
She ignores the book and stumbles around him

CHAPLAIN
Miss Fox

Maggie keeps moving Putting more distance between herself
and whoever--whatever that was

As she flees she reaches back to touch her own shoulder
Her fingertips find a thin slit in the fabric of her dress
They come back bloody

MAGGIE
Katy

INT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Kate stares into the mirror above the washstand She frowns
at her bloodshot eyes Then frowns at her frown lines

KNOCK KNOCK

KATE
Yes

She crosses to the door Opens it a crack No one there But
as soon as she closes it again--

KNOCK KNOCK

She opens it fast Peers out The corridor is empty
Now with the door still open

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

Kate turns her head

The sound is coming from behind the mirror Through the wall
they share with the Bachelors cabin

KATE
(shouting)
Very amusing MrWhoever

The KNOCKING stops

Kate moves toward the wall until her lips are only inches
from the wood partition

KATE (CONTD)
You shouldve built up to that
smoke trick Rapping on the wall
seems a lot less impressive by
comparison

SILENCE from next door

KATE (CONTD)
I hope you lost all your money at
that card game You must have if
youve got nothing better to do now
than--

KNOCKKNOCKKNOCKKNOCKKNOCKKNOCKKNOCK

Kate staggers back
She yells over the noise

KATE
IllI11 make a complaint I
happen to be very well-acquainted
with the captain of this vessel

The sound changes
Not KNOCKS anymore

BLOWS Struck by something other than a fist

BANG
The wall shakes

BANG

BANG
BANG

Kate runs out of her room into the
CORRIDOR
where she sees a MAID exiting another cabin

KATE
Thank God Hello I need help
Theres something wrong in my cabin
and--dont you hear that

The Maid responds with a curt nod The BANGING continues

KATE

Well
AID

Dont tell me Blackbeards ghost
KATE

What No This isnt--Im not doing

this
The woman is already walking in the other direction

Kate goes after her But when she pursues her around a
corner theres suddenly no sign of the Maid

CLICK

The sound of a latch up ahead A sliver of darkness that
grows wider

Kate marches to the slowly opening door

With the light from the hallway she can just make out the
Maid standing inside facing the wall

The pale X of apron straps that crisscross her back
And the sallow heels of the Maids bare feet

Kate steps across the threshold into the

DARK ROOM

Her footsteps are muffled She looks down and finds packed
earth A dirt floor

The door slams shut behind Kate Sealing her in pitch
blackness until--a fire roars to life on her left

Kates eyes widen with recognition The low ceiling The
sparse furniture

Shes in a farmhouse

The Maid faces the hearth Stirring something in a pot hung
over the fire

An elderly couple sit on either side of a rough table

KATE
Momma Poppa How

Her mother and father are motionless heads bowed in prayer
eyes shut

The Maid turns her head Her profile is unmistakable

KATE (CONTD)
Leah

Leah turns her attention back to the pot

Kate sits at the head of the table so she can prod her
mothers shoulder

KATE (CONTD)
Momma

Both her parents remain frozen

Kate leans in closer to her mothers face The skin has a
waxy sheen to it

A black mole on her mothers chin grows larger before her
eyes The dark spot widens out--then forward

The mole juts out further and further from the skin
Followed by a cluster of tiny legs

Its the shiny black head of a fat white grub

Kate YELPS in disgust as it wriggles free of her mothers
face and lands on the table

No one else moves

Not her mother with the hole in her chin Not her father
Not--

Kate looks to the fire Leah is gone

Theres darkness again as a bag is pulled over Kates head
from behind

She struggles inside the coarse fabric

Not a bag A heavy burlap dress

Kate is forced into it The sleeves crossed in front of her
The ends are clasped between her parents praying hands

Pulled tight

KATE (CONTD)
No Let go Nooo

Her fathers face softens His nose slumps to one side
Then drops off

Something orange and stringy dangles from the cavity
Kate SCREAMS

Her mothers face caves in on itself Splitting down the
middle Thick orange innards and white seeds spill out

Kate wrenches her body back and forth
Gnarled vines sprout from her parents rotting fingertips
They wind around the sleeves of Kates dress

She draws her legs up in front of her and kicks at the table
for leverage until--

Kate falls backwards through the floor
What was packed dirt is now muddy water

She splutters up for air

The rest of the room is unchanged Her parents remain seated
at the table above her

All somehow resting on the surface of this dark lake

Leah stands over her submerged sister Her toes level with
Kates wild eyes

Kate struggles to tread water in the baggy dress

Leah places the sole of her foot on Kates head
Presses her under

Kate fights hard but the heavy burlap draws her deeper The
firelight on the surface grows dim as she sinks

She battles with the dress Finally wrangles it up and over
her head

Kate surfaces again--this time facing the door

She paddles frantically to it Reaches up for the knob and
gets it open

Through it she can see the ships corridor

Kate digs her fingernails into the floor on the other side
of the threshold

With the last of her strength she drags herself up and onto
the dry land of the hallway

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Maggie races back to her cabin

She hears Kate before she sees her

Her sister is on all fours in the hallway

Several onlookers gawk from the open doors of their own
rooms as she crawls past

Maggie rushes to her sisters aid

Kates dress and hair are soaked Her teeth chatter from
cold or terror or both

INT CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

Kate shivers on the bottom bunk Maggie reaches back to
press a handkerchief against the cut on her own shoulder

KATE
Whats happening to us

MAGGIE
I dont know

KATE
What do we do
MAGGIE
I dont know
KATE
Momma and Poppait was too

horrible Oh god Maggie We told
the whole world spirits dont exist
but they do and theyre punishing
us We have to take it all back
Its the only way to save us

MAGGIE
Would you shut your mouth I cant
hear myself think

Kate bursts into tears
Maggie kneels down in front of her little sister

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Listen to yourself Say we did
recant--who would believe us now

KATE
But we have proof Look at us

MAGGIE
We never told anyone why we
confessed when we did We never
breathed a word about that womans
suicide or the part we played in
it Now Im supposed to tell
everyone her husband that died in
the Arctic chased me down with an
axe That you almost drowned
inside our old farmhouse inside
this ship

KATE
I wasnt on this ship I stepped
through that door intoI dont
know But I crawled back out I
crawled back out

MAGGIE
All these years lying through our
teeth speaking for dead
relatives--why punish us now that

weve stopped

KATE
Some things cant ever be made
right

MAGGIE

Telling that widow what she wanted
to hear was meant to be a kindness
I never thought she would

KATE
At least we werent lying when we
told her he made it to the other
side

Kates eyes widen

KATE (CONTD)
But Iit was Leah who attacked
me How can that be when shesI
mean shes not

FLASH TO
INT LEAHS HOME IN NEW YORK - NIGHT

Leahs in her nightgown A lamp in one hand The other
trembles as it reaches for the doorknob to

THE PARLOR
From inside

A wet THWACKTHWACKTHWACK The sound all butcher shops
have in common

Leah pushes the door open The sound stops

The dark room appears empty until she steps forward The
light from her lamp washes over

A tent

Where the table and chairs should be--a canvas field tent is
pitched in the center of the room Flaps closed

Leah takes another step inside

Suddenly the flaps open A man emerges

He wears the blood-stained leather apron of a military
Sawbones

The saw in question clenched in one thick rubber glove

He greets Leah with a deep bow

The back of his head is mush The product of an errant
musket ball

He uses the saw to hold open one of the tent flaps

NEXT
Leah backs away

She doesnt see the two soldiers in Union colors behind her
They hold a cloth stretcher vertically between them

As she backs up against it they lift the lower end
Sweeping her off her feet

They carry Leah SCREAMING into the tent

BACK TO
INT MAGGIE AND KATES CABIN - CONTINUOUS
Where Kate waits for an answer to her question about Leah

MAGGIE
I dont know

BANG BANG BANG
Kate SCREAMS
Maggie moves to the door

KATE
No Dont open it

AGGIE
Doors dont stop ghosts

KATE

(hissing)
Are we back to being experts on the
spirit world already

Maggie reaches for the knob

KATE
Please Maggie dont Thats how
it started before

BANG BANG BANG

Maggie jumps

From outside their door

MANS VOICE (0S)
Open up Captains orders

INT CAPTAINS QUARTERS - LATER
Maggie and Kate sit huddled together before the Captain

CAPTAIN PIKE
Disturbing your fellow passengers
Running through corridors
Drowning in broom closets I
cant fathom what you hoped to
achieve with these performances but
they end now

Maggie rotates in her seat so he can see the back of her
shoulder where dried blood frames the slash in the fabric

MAGGIE
Does this look like a performance

CAPTAIN PIKE
I dont pretend to know the depths
to which a woman starved of
attention will sink

MAGGIE
We paid for safe passage You have
an obligation to protect us from--

CAPTAIN PIKE
From what Exactly Point me to the
source of the danger madam Name
your tormentors But for brevitys
sake please limit yourself to
those composed of flesh and blood
Theyre easier to shackle that way

Faced with his blatant contempt Kate withers
And Maggie finally realizes

MAGGIE
Everyone

CAPTAIN PIKE
Excuse me

MAGGIE

Its everyone Everyone hates us
KATE

Maggie
MAGGIE

Half of them always did The ones
who suspected we were frauds from
the very beginning Then we
confessed and turned the other half
against us too Every single person
weve met since then has hated us
Without exception

KATE
Youre scaring me Maggie

AGGIE
Hundreds of thousands of people
all those voicescursing our

names Wishing Hell on us until

Maggie looks at Kate with a mix of fear and guilt

AGGIE (CONTD)
until Hell obliged them

CAPTAIN PIKE
Ive heard enough You two will be
escorted back to your cabin where
youll remain until we dock in
Liverpool

MAGGIE
We wont be safe there--

CAPTAIN PIKE
This is a modern ocean liner Miss
Fox but Im afraid Hell-proof
rooms arent a feature Not even in
First Class

The Captain opens the door and beckons for burly Second
Officer HARLAN to enter

CAPTAIN PIKE
Mr Harlan will take the first
watch

KATE
Please You have to help us

Harlan hauls the women up by their arms

NT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Harlan uses more force than necessary to drive the women
back to their cabin

The hallways are crowded with guests dressed for dinner

The stares of their fellow passengers bore into the sisters
as they pass

As Harlan drags them Maggies bombarded by a
SERIES OF IMAGES

In her minds eye

The crucifix on the chapel wall multiplies into

a row of telegraph poles that stretch as far as the eye can
see between barren grassland and a murky sky

A BUZZING sound grows in volume as

aswarm of flies converges on a patch of soiled ground at
the base of a telegraph pole

where thick maroon sludge bubbles up

A long gray rat tail floats on the surface--then wriggles
to life and submerges

The red becomes an inky black that dribbles and separates
into the smudgy typeface of anewspaper

Maggie and Kates picture on the front page curls and chars
consumed by fire

The flames are rounded

Trapped in two precise circles--over the eyes of The Doctor
back on the stage in New York

The glass spheres blaze with light

Not a reflection--not spectacles

The round lenses are embedded in his skin lit from behind
like furnace windows

He sweeps his arm out toward the crowd

The same full house as before
All still

All the same as the Doctor

Burning circles where their eyes should be
Scorching orange light that--

BACK TO REALITY

--becomes the setting sun streaming through their porthole
as Maggie and Kate are thrust into their

CABIN

So bright that when the door slams shut behind them it
takes a moment to realize

Harlan is on this side of it
Maggie positions herself between Harlan and Kate

MAGGIE
Im sure the Captain doesnt expect
you to keep a literal watch on us
Wouldnt taking up a post out in
the hall be more appropriate

HARLAN
A lecture on propriety from the Fox
sisters As I live and breathe

MAGGIE
My dress is torn and my sisters is
damp We need to change

HARLAN
Right you are

He doesnt budge

MAGGIE
Get out Now

HARLAN
There was me thinking youd be glad
of a little company Shut up in
here Nothing to pass the time

He moves forward backing them further into the room

There are MUFFLED VOICES out in the corridor

Maggie looks past him at the door He follows her gaze

HARLAN
Now now We dont want to upset
all those nice folks on their way
to dinner Give em indigestion
Over what

He takes another step closer

HARLAN (CONTD)
A ships officer forced to subdue a
pair of hysterical passengers

Closer
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
Harlan halts his advance

He doesnt take his eyes off the sisters--just angles his
head to shout back at the door

HARLAN (CONTD)
What

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

HARLAN (CONTD)
Identify yourself

KNOCK KNOCK
Harlan backs up to the door

HARLAN (CONTD)
Identify yourself or clear off

aggie steps sideways so the light streaming in the
porthole behind her strikes Harlan full in the face

He squints and puts a hand up to shield his eyes

aggie signals Kate with a look
KNOCK KNOCK
Followed by a MALE VOICE from outside the room

MALE VOICE
Open up Captains orders
HARLAN
Im in the middle of his bloody
orders right now

He opens the door Sticks his head out
No one there

HARLAN (CONTD)
What the hell

MAGGIE
Now

She and Kate rush him

They shove him out into the

CORRIDOR

and SLAM the door closed

The lock CLICKS

Harlan pounds the door with his fists

A couple on their way to dinner turn to look at him

He touches the brim of his hat to call their attention to
his uniform

They continue on their way
Lowering his voice

HARLAN
Crafty mares Dont forget who runs
this paddock

Back inside the
CABIN
Maggie and Kate hear JANGLING--

KATE
Does he have a skeleton key

Even as she asks the question--
CLICK

Maggie angles herself against the door

MAGGIE
The trunk

Kate darts across the room and drags their trunk away from
the wall beneath the porthole

The lamp topples off and breaks

Kate gets on her knees behind the trunk and pushes with
everything shes got

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Hurry up

KATE
Its heavy

MAGGIE
So is he

Harlan THUDS against the door

Kate finally gets the trunk close enough that Maggie has to
move out of its way

Harlan gets the door open a few inches Sticks his grubby
fingers around the edge--

Maggie and Kate ram the trunk up against the door
--almost taking those fingers off

Almost

Maggie and Kate sit on the trunk for good measure
Harlan shoulders it one last time Gives up

HARLAN (0OS)
You want to make this uncivilized
I was gonna have the kitchen staff
bring some dinner--but you can
starve you hear me Skirts or no

skirts

KATE
I wasnt even hungry until he said
that

Maggie goes to put her hand over Kates--Kate recoils

MAGGIE
Just a few more days Well get off
this ship and--

KATE
And what

Theres an edge in her voice Fear and exhaustion turned to
manic despair

She gets up from the trunk and crosses to the porthole
The shattered glass lamp shade CRUNCHES under her shoes

Kate examines the horizon The last of the light outside
soon to be swallowed by the sea

MAGGIE
People have to run out of ill will
eventually Or at leastfind

someone new to wish it on

KATE
What are we supposed to do until
then

Maggie leans back to press her ear to the door
No sound of Harlan or the other guests

She scoots off the trunk and quietly shifts one side of it
back an inch Enough so she can get to the latch on the
front of the lid

She opens the trunk and starts to root through it

Kate turns around The trunk lid blocks her view of Maggies
hands

Just as Kates silhouette framed in the dying light blocks
Maggies view of the porthole

Where something is very wrong with the ring of steel rivets
They glow furnace red Lose shape

Behind Kates back the first stream of melted steel oozes
down the wall

KATE (CONTD)
What are you looking for

MAGGIE
Something we can use to defend
ourselves

KATE
Against Hell
Something

She pulls

MAGGIE
Theyll come for us again Either
we keep fighting them off or

KATE
Fight them off Were locked ina
room We should never have set foot
on this ship in the first place
Why did we tell the truth Nobody
wants to hear it That was the
worst good thing we could ever do

CLUNKS as Maggies fingers dig in the trunk
out a blouse wrapped around

AGGIE
You brought your table-lifters

KATE
Why wouldnt I Theyre mine And I
might need them where Im going

AGGIE
Where youre going

KATE

As soon as our feet touch dry land
you point your toes one way and
mine are going the other

Maggie busies herself inside the trunk again

KATE (CONTD)
Ill be sure to send you a copy of
the playbill for my first show
Only how will I know which gutter
to address it to

Maggie looks up as the room goes dim

CRRRAAACK

KATE (CONTD)

Just keep your eyes open With any
luck Ill tour the town youre a
blight on someday and--

IAGGIE
Sshh

KATE
Dont you dare shush me I have
every right to--

MAGGIE
Listen

CRRRAAACK

MAGGIE (CONTD)
It sounds like glass

KATE
The lamp cover broke Im standing
on the pieces

MAGGIE
It went dark so fast

Maggie gets to her feet Moves toward Kate until she can see
the window

The sun hasnt set
Something outside blocks the light
Leahs face

Her forehead is pressed against the porthole

CRAAAACK

The glass shatters inwards
Maggie tries to pull Kate away but Leahs arm snakes inside

Leah grabs Kates hair and yanks her back toward the jagged
edge of the broken window

Maggie pulls Kate by the arms The more she does the more
Kates head is forced back at an unnatural angle

KATE
Ahh Let go AHH

BANG BANG BANG

HARLAN (0S)
What the hells going on in there

Pins come loose as Kate writhes Her hair unfurls enough to
loosen Leahs hold

Maggie gets her own hold on Kates hair

But as she attempts to tear it out of Leahs reach--Leahs
reach extends

A joint POPS Leahs shoulder dislocates
Its pressed up against her own cheek
Her face and arm fill the hole simultaneously

Both gouged by glass shards as Leah strains forward Her
hand still tangled in Kates hair

KATE
MAGGIE MAGGIE

The door rattles in its frame as Harlan SLAMS against it
from outside--

Maggie has both her hands wrapped around the hair at the
base of Kates head

She looks to the door

MAGGIE
Help We need help

But Harlans progress is hindered by the trunk

MAGGIE
(to Kate)
Put your hands where mine are Keep
pulling

Kate obeys even as she protests

KATE
No--dont let go

aggie lets go
She runs to the door
Kate is dragged backward

She drops to her knees Uses her own body weight to resist
Leahs pull Yanking down on her own hair to keep it
attached to her scalp

aggie heaves the trunk out of the way of the door Harlan
rushes in He goes to restrain Maggie--then spots Leah

Impossibly clinging to the ships hull

MAGGIE
Do you have a knife

Harlan is dumbstruck
aggie rushes back to Kates side

MAGGIE (CONTD)
A knife Anything

aggie punches Leah in the face
Her sister snaps her jaws in delight trying to bite Maggie

Harlan lurches out of his stupor He digs out a pocket knife
and opens it

aggie snatches it from him She stabs at Leahs hand a few
times to no effect

So she hacks at Kates hair instead

Harlan wrestles with Leahs arm She ignores him until--
Maggie saws through enough hair to pull Kate free

Leah gropes for Kate--SCREECHES when shes unsuccessful

Harlan grabs Leahs wrist Tries to force her arm back
outside the window

She suddenly pulls as he pushes--throwing him off balance
She yanks his arm out the window

He SHOUTS as the glass at the portholes edge cuts through
the fabric of his uniform and scores the flesh beneath

She pulls hard--

BASH

--his head connects with the wall
Kate tugs Maggie toward the door

KATE
Come on

But Maggie goes back to help Harlan

She wraps him in a bear hug from behind He gets one of his
feet up on the wall for leverage

Together they pull his arm back inside

Unfortunately Leah comes in with it
She keeps her iron grip on Harlans wrist

Leahs bones SNAP as her body constricts to worm through the
narrow opening--then POP CLICK GRIND back into place

Her head and shoulders are inside Her other arm seizes
Harlans neck

KATE
Maggie

Overcome with pain and panic Harlan sinks to his knees

Leah wriggles in above him Forcing Maggie to back away

Leah hangs on to his windpipe for purchase as her hips CRUSH
CRACK WRIGGLE through the porthole

KATE (CONTD)
Maggie Above you

Maggie looks up
The ceiling is semi-translucent A sheet of ice

It GROANS under the weight of a blurry figure treading above
them Webs of cracks form around each footfall

Maggie spares one last glance at Harlan
His eyes are still open but--
The ceiling GROOAANNS again Ready to give

Maggie darts around the edge of the room back to Kate
Together they run out into the

CORRIDOR

and Maggie closes the door behind them just as--

CRASH

--something lands inside their cabin
They tear down the hall

KATE
HELP HELP ANYONE

A door bursts open as they pass--stopping them in their
tracks Its the man who wore the life vest The one who was
scolded by his wife the night of the fire

KATE
Oh thank God Please help us Were
in terrible--

SLAM

KATE (CONTD)
--danger

Kate raises a fist to bang on the closed door--

KATE (CONTD)
Son of a Baptist

--but Maggie hears another DOOR OPEN back in the direction
of their own cabin

She grabs Kates arm and hauls her away
They run Dashing around every corner they come to until

KATE
Where are we

MAGGIE
No idea

At the end of this unknown hallway--a door marked CREW
Maggie tries the door

It opens into a

STAIRWAY

Maggie and Kate enter the stairwell to find another doorway
just ahead of them

From the other side--CLANGING POTS AND PANS

MAGGIE
Must be a service entrance to the
Second Class Kitchen

Kate moves to go inside Maggie stops her

KATE
What
MAGGIE
Theres people in there

KATE
Yes

Kate moves to enter the kitchen again
AGAIN Maggie stops her

MAGGIE
Look what happened to that ships
officer I dont want anyone else
to die because of us Thats what
started all this

(off Kates look)

Certain choices I made didnt help
Although in fairness no one forced
you to go along with anything--

KATE
You forced me to choose between you
and Leah I chose wrong and all
Ive got to show for it is her
vengeful ghost You try to control
me exactly like she did--you just
arent any good at it

Kate shoves Maggie aside Maggie tugs at Kates skirt

MAGGIE
Wait no Iyoure right I dont
know what Im doing Just please
dont make me do it alone I dont
want to And I cant Alright I
cant

KATE
Well we have to go somewhere
And like it or not were trapped in
a floating bean tin packed to the
lid with other people

Maggie looks at the staircase leading up--
To the First Class deck

And the staircase leading down--

To the bowels of the ship

MAGGIE
We go down

They follow the staircase down past Ships Provisions
and down again to

STEERAGE

where the stairs end at the

ENTRYWAY TO THE MAIN CARGO HOLD

A pair of unlit lanterns hang from hooks on either side of
he gaping black doorway

ct

Maggie takes one down holds it close to her ear and shakes
it gently NOTHING

She repeats the process with the second lantern A faint
SLOSH from inside

MAGGIE
Christ in heaven doesnt anybody
ever fill these things

Theres a dispenser with matches mounted to the wall

Maggie lights the usable lantern Then stuffs a fistful of
matches into her dress pocket

IAGGIE
(off Kates look)
Just in case

KATE
How long are we going to be down
here

AGGIE

We need time to figure out how to
stop these things

KATE
If we can stop them

Maggie reaches over and tugs one of Kates earlobes A
gesture thats aggressively affectionate

Like sisterhood itself
Side by side they enter the
CARGO HOLD

The room is massive

A literal maze of crates cases trunks and barrels stacked
twenty feet high

The ships engines make a steady WHOOMP WHOOMP WHOOMP

The crates are arranged in makeshift aisles Maggie leads
Kate into the widest one Straight ahead

KATE
Its cold
MAGGIE
(unsure)
Were below the waterline Thats
all

She thrusts the lantern out in front of her But its dim

By the time they see the shrouded figure in front of them
its too late to get away--

Kate SCREAMS
The faceless figure doesnt react

MAGGIE
Sshh Listen

TICK TICK TICK

Maggie pulls the sheet offa grandfather clock

The sisters share a moment of relief before--
--frost blooms on the glass over the clocks face
From behind the giant timepiece out steps

The man with the axe

aggie pushes Kate out of the way

MAGGIE
Go

Kate swerves around him Disappearing into the darkness

aggie throws up her arm in self-defense as he brings the
axe down--theres a metallic CLANG and a SPARK as it hits
the steel bar strapped there

aggie wears one of Kates table lifters Now visible
through her tattered sleeve

Not exactly the weapon she hoped to find among their
possessions But beggars cant be choosers

Maggie pivots away as the axe comes down again

She tries to follow Kate but--

SLAM

--a stack of crates moves Propelled by an unseen force
Blocking her path Forcing her in another direction

The Axe Man gives chase

Another pile of crates moves

And another

SLAM SLAM

q

The maze shifts as she runs through it

The Axe Man never far behind until--

shes caught

Maggie spins around to face her attacker She swings the
lamp at him--

He knocks it from her hand It lands on its side at her
feet The flame wavers DIM BRIGHT DIM BRIGHT

He pins her up against the wall of crates and wraps his free
hand around her throat

Rears back with the axe and--
CRASH
--sinks it into the wooden crate beside her head
No quick death for this medium

He tightens his grip on her neck Lifts her up off the
floor Her shoe heels RAP against the crate behind her

Maggie beats her fists against his chest

She claws at his scarf--revealing the bluish skin of his
lower face

He grins and leans in A lover with a kiss His lips part

A jet black eel slithers out of his throat and drops at
Maggies feet

She sees herself reflected in his snow goggles Tears
streaming down her crimson face Her clothes in tatters

Maggie reaches down--RIPS open the front of her dress
Exposing her corset

Her fingers find the slender point of whalebone thats worn
through its casing

Maggie withdraws the corset stay
The tapered bone is nearly a foot long Rigid

he stabs up at him with it Jabs it through the bottom of
is throat

Ss
h
He smiles so she can see the ivory point inside his mouth
This is it He wont let go

Maggies body goes limp

Her eyes lose focus With her last whisper of breath

MAGGIE
Forgive me

Suddenly--A BLAST OF HEAT

Searing brightness and a HISS Oxygen rushing to a fuse
Maggie drops to the floor Inhales a ragged lungful of air
HES GONE

No ashes No trace Like flash paper

Leaving just the whalebone Streaked with red

Maggie realizes the hand she used to stab him is bleeding
Pricked by the corset stay

She gets to her feet

The lamp flame burns low--the oil almost gone A pale circle
of light in this cavernous room

Where somewhereher sister is just as lost as she is

SWITCH TO KATES POV

Without a lantern Kates progress is slow She feels her
way through the maze of crates

Anticipating what could be lurking around every corner

Kate comes out into a wider area fairly straight Shes
wandered back into the main aisle

She looks left then rightheads right
From far away

MAGGIES VOICE
Kate

Its hard to tell in a room this size--and the DRONE of the
ships engines doesnt make it any easier--but it seems like
the sound is coming from ahead of her

KATE
Im here Over here

From not so far away

MAGGIES VOICE
Ssshh

Kates head whips around
That definitely came from behind her

KATE
Maggie

MAGGIES VOICE - FAR AWAY
Kate Where are you Call out to me
again and Ill find you

And from the opposite direction

MAGGIES VOICE - WHISPER
Quiet This way

KATE
But - -

MAGGIES VOICE - WHISPER
Thats not me Its trying to
trick you

Kate stays where she is
She strains her eyes in the direction of the whisper

Therein the aisle a distance behind Katea silhouette

Blacker than the black around it
A stain on the darkness
It approaches Kate slowly

MAGGIES VOICE - WHISPER
Hurry This way

KATE
How do I know youre you

MAGGIES VOICE - WHISPER
Because I am yarn-for-brains

Kate moves toward the silhouette

KATE
What happened to the lantern

TAP TAP TAP TAP

The sound of Kates own footsteps
Kate stops SILENCE

KATE (CONTD)
Did you take your shoes off

Her sisters silhouette comes closer

KATE (CONTD)
I cant hear your footsteps

Closer
Growing taller

Too tall

(CONTD)

Gliding above the floor Bare feet hanging beneath the hem

of a filthy nightgown--toenails grazing the wood planks

Wrong sister

Kate spins around and runs from Leahs ghost

She crashes through the darkness Turning at the first
opportunity Away from the main aisle Into the warren of

narrow offshoots

Still a distance away

THE REAL MAGGIES VOICE
Kate

KATE
Maggie

Kate reaches a T-junction and goes left

She races down this new aisle Arms out groping for another
place to turn when--

A CLATTER OF HOOVES
--something on all fours charges past her SQUEALING
Kate stumbles back against a stack of barrels

Not hard enough to knock them off balance--but they topple
over anyway

WHAM WHAM

nearly crushing her

Kate runs again Down a long straightaway until
deadend

The towering stacks of crates on either side meet the hull
Leaving only a narrow gap between wood and steel

But if she can squeeze through it

Kate angles her body around the edge of crate wall
She gets one leg into the crevice--
SNAPCRUNCH

Kate HOWLS and falls back into the aisle--her foot caught in
the metal jaws of an animal trap

SWITCH TO MAGGIES POV
Maggie alters her course to follow Kates SCREAMS

MAGGIE
Katy I can hear you Im close

And she is So close

Just a colossal wall of crates and boxes between them

Maggie races along it Desperately seeking a way through

SWITCH TO KATES POV
Leahs silhouette looms closer

Now Kate does hear FOOTSTEPS--running this way--but from
somewhere up above--

Maggie climbed over the wall

She appears on top of the cargo tower Her lantern in one
hand The other holds her bundled-up skirt

She CRASHES down onto Leah
The lantern goes out as Maggie lands
IN THE PITCH BLACK

KATE
Maggie Maggie

A horrible GASPING

SHUFFLING

Something crawls across the floor toward Kate
She throws her arms up in self-defense--

KATE
No Please

A match is struck
Kate is nose to nose with
Maggie

Her sister struggles to speak The wind still knocked out of
her from the fall

Kate pulls her into a hug without thinking--extinguishing
the match

A dull sound of METAL ON WOOD as Maggie bumps Kates injured
foot in the darkness

Kate cries out in pain

ANOTHER MATCH

Maggie sees the trap on Kates foot She leans down with the
match to inspect it--

KATE
Wait

Kate scans the darkness beyond the lights reach

KATE (CONTD)
Where is she

aggie extends the arm holding the match so Kate can see--

--crumpled on the floor back where Maggie landed--

Leahs nightgown
Empty

KATE
Is she

MAGGIE
I dont know

The match burns low enough to singe Maggies fingers
She shakes it out
Kate HYPERVENTILATES in the darkness

MAGGIE
Its ok Ive got more

ANOTHER MATCH
She withdraws the rest from her pocket Passes them to Kate
Kate immediately goes to strike one--Maggie stops her

MAGGIE
Wait until this one burns out We
only have so many

She raises Kates skirt
The device on her foot is similar in design to a bear trap
Only scaled down to catch rats

Maggie presses down on the spring lever to pry open the
jagged bands of steel

Kate MOANS as the broken bones in her foot grind together

But shes free

The trap is attached to a short length of chain--used to
slide it into tight spaces

Maggie uses it now to shove the re-opened jaws a safe
distance away from where they sit

Her match goes out
ANOTHER MATCH
This time struck by Kate

Maggie examines her sisters foot Blood oozes through the
tears in the shoe leather

MAGGIE
Can you walk on it

Kate shakes her head
Then suddenly jerks backwards

MAGGIE
I wasnt even touching you--

KATE
It moved

Kate holds the dying match out with a shaky hand
Toward the nightgown
Maggie turns to look

The fabric twitches

The match goes out

ANOTHER MATCH
Both sisters stare in horror at the empty nightgown
It twitches again
The sleeve moving as
a rat scurries out
Maggie and Kate exhale Maggie turns back to Kates foot
The match dies Kate strikes

ANOTHER MATCH

just in time to see the nightgown snake across the floor
toward them Before Kate can warn her--

--it crawls up Maggies back

The hollow neckline is level with Maggies shoulders

The sleeves cross themselves over her chest

By the time Maggie realizes whats happening--

--the nightgown isnt empty anymore

Leahs head crowns through the opening

She sinks her teeth into the cartilage of Maggies ear
Maggie SHRIEKS The pain is everything

Kate drops the last few matches Grabs the re-set trap by
the chain--

KATE
Maggie

--and swings--

Maggie wrenches her head out of the way--severing a portion
of her ear

Kate smashes Leah in the side of the face with the trap

The jaws SNAP closed around Leahs head

The match goes out

Kate is too afraid to grope around for another
She cowers her back to the wall frozen

A hand finds hers--

--Kate SCREAMS

MAGGIE
Its me

KATE
Ive heard that before

But she can make out Maggies face The darkness isnt so
dark anymore

Even the blood from Maggies bitten ear is visible

Theres no sign of Leah or the trap

KATE (CONTD)
I dropped the matches

MAGGIE
Its ok I can see one next to you

Kate looks down and she can see it too

No point striking it though

Sickly light bathes the narrow aisle

It grows brighter Maggie and Kates eyes are in deep
shadow Their faces lit from above

Maggie looks up

MAGGIE
Is that

q

There high above the crates that pen them in--

The moon
Gleaming a perverse shade of bluish-green
Like a theater prop generously coated in phosphorous paint

The WHOOMP WHOOMP of the engines gets faster as hell bleeds
into reality

WHOOMPWHOOMPWHOOMP
Higher-pitched
Morphing into
CRICKETS

Kate LAUGHS bitterly

AGGIE
Whats happening

KATE
Cant you smell it

AGGIE
What

KATE

Pig shit Were home

A shadow falls over them
Leah squats on her haunches perched on the crate wall

The trap is still locked around one side of her head As
they watch she grabs the chain and pulls the device off

Without opening it

Puncture wounds become gouges

Her skin bunches and shreds as she frees herself

Its a mercy that her ruined face is in shadow

Leah tosses the trap down at her sisters--WHAM

But then shes still A gargoyle in a dirty nightgown

KATE
What is she waiting for

MAGGIE
Them

Kate drags her eyes away from Leah to follow Maggies gaze
There are people in the aisle

Only a few yards away Just standing there Each holds an
unlit candle

Men women children

Their faces all identical--and wrong

The candles flicker to life illuminating the faces above
them The townsfolk wearwire masks wrapped in gauze

Something is different about the crates now too

They seemfuzzy

Maggie puts a hand out to the wall of cargo at her side
Not wooden crates anymore

Massive bales of straw

MAGGIE
Oh my god

KATE
We wound up being heretics instead
of witches Real or fake--turns out
the punishment is the same

On cue the masked townsfolk come to life They shuffle
toward the sisters

Maggie winces as Kate squeezes her injured handfresh
blood oozes from the wound

FLASH BACK TO

CHAPLAIN
you have not yet resisted to
the point of shedding your blood

FLASH BACK TO
As shes throttled by the Axe Man

MAGGIE
Forgive me

Followed by a BLAST OF HEAT

BACK TO PRESENT

IAGGIE
Weve bled All thats left is to
repent

KATE
What

IAGGIE

We confessed but we never asked
forgiveness--for any of it

KATE
So

AGGIE
So ask now Beg

KATE
Oh right Sorry Im sorry

The mob keeps coming

MAGGIE
I think you have to mean it

KATE
Oh

AGGIE
KATE

KATE
But I dont Theyll know if Im
lying right Youre the one who
felt bad I never did We got to
see the world The world got to see
us

The mob keeps advancing A slow crush of vengeance
Kate looks up to speak directly to Leah

KATE

But we shouldnt have left you Not
the way we did Whatever your
motives--you did take care of us
Hell if wed convinced you to go
along with our confession youd
have secured us a better venue to
do it in at least

(off Maggies look)
And gotten us a better percentage
of the ticket sales

Leah doesnt react The townsfolk are almost on them now

Close enough to see the eyeholes in their masks are empty

KATE

Im sorry Leah Truly Everyone
we fooled can go rot But you were
my sister

MAGGIE
Qur sister

KATE
Forgive us

The mob descends
Maggie draws Kate to her protectively

Heads together eyes closed tense

a FLASH so bright it sears through their eyelids

a BLAST OF HEAT so intense it kills their SCREAMS

INT SECOND CLASS DINING ROOM - NIGHT
Passengers linger over drinks and desserts
The Head Waiter presides over the calm until

From the swinging doors that lead to the kitchen--a sudden
exodus of staff

Cooks and pot scrubbers in filthy aprons spill out into the
dining room Retreating from--

The Fox sisters

q

They too enter the dining room via the kitchen
A HUSH falls over the crowded room

Even the Head Waiter is frozen in place

Maggie carries Kate piggyback style

She brings her sister to the nearest table and lowers her
gently into an open chair

The rest of the tables occupants flee their seats

Kate maneuvers her injured foot up onto a vacant chair
flashing a fair amount of calf in the process

But the real shock value belongs to Maggie herself

Between her torn dress the strange metal appliance strapped
to her bare arm the blood dripping from her ravaged ear--

No one can decide what to be offended by first
She sinks into the chair on Kates other side
Theres a lit candle in the tables centerpiece

Maggie picks up an unused dessert spoon She holds it by the
handle so the bowl rests in the flame

Kate selects an abandoned glass and sniffs the amber-colored
liquid inside--then downs it in one

Suddenly mindful of her audience Kate attempts to tuck a
strand of butchered hair behind her ear

Still holding the spoon in the flame Maggie uses her free
hand to withdraw one of her own hairpins

She hands it to Kate
Who gratefully accepts

KATE
Im starving

She tries to hail a server standing a few tables away

KATE
Excuse me

He can only stare

The Head Waiter finally thaws and beelines for the women
His eyebrows are arched so severely they could snap

Just as he arrives at their table--

Maggie brings the heated spoon up and presses it against the
ragged edge of her bitten ear

The wound SIZZLES as she cauterizes it

q

The other passengers are shocked out of their silence into
GASPS and NAUSEOUS GROANS

Kate raises another orphaned whiskey glass in salute

KATE
You wont see that at the worlds
fair

Swallowing back his own revulsion

HEAD WAITER
Perhaps I could direct you ladies
to the ships physician

KATE
Perhaps you could direct the ships
physician to us And we could have
something to eat in the meantime

HEAD WAITER
You cant expect--

KATE
(ignoring him to Maggie)
What do you want

MAGGIE
Anything but the soup

KATE
(to Head Waiter)
Just bring the menu

The Head Waiter flounders a few moments--then retreats out
of the dining room At speed

KATE
Do you think theyve found that
officer yet The guard
What s-his-name

MAGGIE
Probably If there was enough left
of him to find

People around them are talking again Whispering
All eyes fixed on the two of them
Maggie is past caring

Kate almost welcomes the familiar sensation of controlling a
room She adjusts the neckline of her dress

The Head Waiter returns with a quartet of ships officers

He points them in the sisters direction Not that theyre
hard to spot

Kate sighs at the group of men approaching
Her hand finds Maggies

KATE
Do you think theyll believe us

Maggie surprises them both with a SNORT of laughter
She squeezes Kates hand

In this room full of gawking strangers

A hundred faces None of them kind

Two sisters adrift

Anchored only to each other

EXT PARISIAN THEATER - DAY
Kate and Maggie examine the marquee before entering

Kate walks with a slight limp and still manages to make her
cane look like a fashion choice

INT PARISTAN THEATER - CONTINUOUS
The theater is old Glamorous

And empty save for the well-heeled THEATER OWNER approaching
them from the box office

THEATER OWNER
Nous sommes fermes

MAGGIE
Vous etesle proprietaire

He smiles at her broken French Not unkindly

THEATER OWNER
I am the owner yes But as I say
we are closed mesdames

KATE
Weve come to audition

THEATER OWNER
Ah pardon Such lovely ladies A
little mature perhapsbut I must
disappoint To my knowledge none
of our performers are seeking
assistants at this time

Maggie and Kate smile at him

KATE
Oh were not assistants

MAGGIE
Were the Fox Sisters

FADE OUT

THE END
