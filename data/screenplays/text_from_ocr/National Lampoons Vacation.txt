engine It runs on shivering and chugging Rusty gets
out Clark restarts the engine guns it and turns it off
again It continues to run on ELLEN and AUDREY come out

on this one

CLARK
All new cars do that bevaee

An air bag inflates as a sudden forward and final jerk of the

car stops the engine Clark is all but suffocating as he

tries to extricate himself and the ignition key from a con-
fusion of shoulder-harness release buttons deceptively conceiled
air bag valve releases and a special steering colum key release
button all amidst a constant cacophony of various buzzer noises

INT KITCHEN - LATER

and loading them into the dishwasher

ELLEN
You know Clark its not too late
to fly out to California We only
have two weeks

CLARK
‘Lets not go through that again
sweetie pie

ELLEN
Lots of families fly Clark Especially
cross-country

CLARK
The idea of a family vacation is to
spend time together as a family You
get on a plane everybody puts on their
headphones and theyre off in their own
worlds In a car you talk you sing
you see the country you meet the people
You share impressions honey You learn

ELLEN
But its an awfully long ride honey

CLARK x
Im looking forward to an awfully
long ride You see the kids all
the time I see them a few minutes
in the morning a few minutes at
night and a few hours on the weekend
Im going to turn around-one of these
days and realize that my little
babies are all grown up Then what

ELLEN
I just thought it might be easier
to fly ee

Audrey is reading a book and eating shoestring licorice
which she has threaded up through her shirt collar
behind her ear and into her mouth so that Rusty wont

Clark is driving its boring and his mind is wandering

The erotic moan of the Ferrari engine in the distance

perks him up Then as if out of nowhere the Ferrari
appears in his mirror he glances over quickly to see

that Ellens asleep Then he whips out his comb and adjusts
his hairstyle combing it forward He wipes his mouth and
adjusts his shirt He puts his arm up and flexes his biscep

The Ferrari zooms up beside the car Clark glances over
thinking hes Robert Mitchum The Girl waves to him He
winks at her She lifts up her left leg and puts her foot
up on the seat Her skirt falls off her knee exposing
the full leg

Clark swallows hard beads of sweat begin to form‘on

his forehead The girl puts the Ferrari in neutral

and revs the engine Clark laughs to himself He can
play her game He puts his car in neutral and revs his
cheesy six cylinders She revs hers again a sexy grow-
