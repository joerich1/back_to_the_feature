version of Craig The Craig puppet paces back and forth
wringing its hands with incredible subtlety We see Craig
above and behind the stage He is manipulating the puppet
His fingers move fast and furious The puppet breaks into

a dance a beautiful and intricate balletic piece Soon the
tower

puppet is leaping and tumbling through space moves that one

would think impossible for a marionette

Sweat appears on

the real Craig’s brow His fingers move like lightning The
puppet moves faster and faster Sweat appears on the puppets
brow We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
device that the real Craig controls The Craig puppet
collapses on the floor of the stage It puts its hands up to
its face and weeps Craig hangs the puppet and comes down
around the front of the stage He is heaving He switches

off the music picks up a beer and takes a swig

Don I was wondering do you know
why our workplace has such low
ceilings

DON
Its an interesting story Wendy
Many years ago in the late 1800s
James Mertin an Irish ship captain
looking to invest in the future of
our great country came to this town
and decided to erect an office
building

CUT TO

One day Captain Mertin received an
unexpected visitor

There is a knock at the door

MERTIN
Enter ye if ye dare enter

A tiny woman enters

TINY WOMAN
Captain Mertin

MERTIN
What want ye girl child

TINY WOMAN
I am not a child Captain Mertin
but rather an adult lady of miniature
proportions

MERTIN
(taken aback)
I see Well it is not my fault that
thou art tiny So if it is charity
yer after then be gone with ye
ye foul demon

TINY WOMAN
I am not asking for alms but rather
the ear of a kind man with a noble
heart

MERTIN
(sighs)
Aye Speak then if ye must

TINY WOMAN
Captain Mertin surely I ama
God-fearing Christian woman like

CUT TO
yourself but alas I am afraid that
the world was not built with me in
mind Door knobs are too high chairs
are unwieldy high-ceilinged rooms
mock my stature Nor am I a marrie
lady Captain after all who would
marry a person of my diminutiveness
So I am forced to work for my few
pennies a week as an optometrist
Why cannot there be a place for me
to work safe and comfortable

Mertin wipes a tear from his eye

TO

MERTIN
Woman your story moves me like n
other Me own sister was tiny and
then died Therefore I shall make
ye me wife And I shall builda
floor in my building between the
7th and 8th which will be scaled
down so from now on there shall
be at least one place on Gods green
Earth that you and your accursed
kind can live in peace

themselves and when they lie on
their deathbeds they have few
regrets The ones who dont go
after what they want well who
gives a shit about them anyway

we will build the ultimate communist
community one body and hundreds
maybe thousands of brains inside
working together to form a super
human intellect capable of curing
disease stopping all war and
ruling the world with a benevolent
fist We will take a wife a woman
of uncommon beauty and intellect who
is as yet still an infant herself

We see a photo of another infant this one with a ribbon in
her hair

Im not certain my dear but I
believe your husband has somehow
psychically diverted the route

LOTTE
That bastard Ill gladly dispose
of him in the name of the order Son
of Malkovich

LESTER
Im afraid that no physical harm
must come to him as long as he
inhabits the vessel

MAN 3
(raises hand)
Oooh I got an idea What if we
build another portal to Malkovich
like around back and sneak in that
way

MAN 4
Only Captain Mertin knew how to build
a portal dummy and hes dead

LESTER
Actually my friends I suppose its
time I told you Im Captain James
Mertin

The members fall into a stunned silence Lester takes
some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on
a board He then rearranges them for a while

LESTER (CONTD)
You see Lester is an anagram for
Mertin

Lester continues to rearrange the letters getting a little
tense now

LESTER (CONTD)
It used to work Im sure of it

Several members check their watches

LESTER (CONTD)
Oh damn it to hell Anyway I am

L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns
from the board to face the congregation

MAN 3
How can this be I thought you were
only one hundred and five years old
Mertin would have to be

LESTER
(chuckles amiably)
Im two hundred and five truth be
told

WOMAN 1
(flirtatiously)
You dont look a day over one
hundred and five Captain Whats
your secret

LESTER
Lots of carrot juice little lady
That and a deal with the Devil

There is a lot of murmuring in the room now

MAN 2
So what exactly are you saying Are
we in cahoots with the Dark Master
here

LESTER
Surprise

The cultists get tense start to leave en masse

LESTER (CONTD)
Wait Its not that bad When we get
into Malkovich we still get to rule
the world just like I told you The
only difference is that we rule in the
name of evil instead of good

People stop in their tracks

MAN 3
Thats the only difference

LESTER
Absolutely

The cultists think about is then shrug and stay put

LESTER (CONTD)
So anyway

Lotte stands
LOTTE
Well I for one am resigning I will
not serve evil I am ashamed of all
of you

Lotte heads for the door

LESTER
My dear let me assure you that when
we attain power it will be much more
pleasant for those inside Malkovich
than for those outside

Lotte stops and turns

LOTTE
Ill take my chances

She exits

LESTER
Anybody else

WOMAN 1

and the Rod Steiger part moving back and forth from one
stool to the another He performs it magnificently We see
Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye

MALKOVICH
How do we do that

MANTINI
A friendly competition if you will
Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S
Truman puppet appear opposite each
other in a play Not some Vegas
Burly-Q pyrotechnics but a real play
that requires actual acting The
audience decides who is more deserving
of the title The losing puppeteer
bows out graciously Goes back to
obscurity as a file clerk

MALKOVICH
Whats the play

MANTINI
Say Equus Its got everything

MALKOVICH
Never heard of it

MANTINI
Broadways finest three hours Its
about the suppression of the
individual Conformity as God in
modern society

MALKOVICH
Sounds boring Are there any songs

Mantini in a gray jumpsuit

MANTINI
(in Craigs voice)
I cant wait to see where you and your
friends live Lotte

LOTTE (0S)
Its beautiful Craig like Eden

Now we see filaments attached to Mantinis arms and w
follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini

FLEMMER
One serpent coming up
Flemmer throws his head back and laughs The camera moves
into his mouth and down his throat which oddly enough
looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
tunnel

MUSIC IN Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head by They
Might Be Giants It plays throughout the credits

FADE OUT

THE END
