RICKY

The whole bar goes grumbles

JEAN GIRARD
Oui

RICKY
(after a beat)
Huh What’s going on Is that a
sound or word

JEAN GIRARD
It means yes I am a Frenchman

RICKY
Well then welcome to America

Ricky goes to punch Jean who deftly blocks it grabs Ricky by
the wrist does a specific pressure hold and slams his head
onto the bar with arm pinned behind his back All in a split
second

JEAN GIRARD
Why would you want to hit me
because I am French

RICKY
(face pressed against the
bar)
Let me go you Formula One jazz
weirdo
JEAN GIRARD
You fear what is different
Unfortunately in this world that is
not so uncommon I will let you go
but before I do I want you to say
“T love crepes”

KEITH DOBY
Don’t say it Ricky Let him break
your arm

Beat as Ricky thinks

RICKY
Alright I’ve thought about it and
I’ve weighed all the options I
have decent insurance a broken arm
isn’t so bad plus my pride and the
respect of my peers is important to
me So go ahead and break my arm

JEAN GIRARD
Msr Bobby please just say “I
love crepes”

RICKY
Let me think about it again
(half beat)
Yep I’m real secure with my
decision Go ahead and do it

GLENN

KEITH DOBY

BARTENDER

crepes this morning They’re just
like pancakes maybe even better

JEAN GIRARD

JEAN GIRARD (contd)
What if you just said “I love
really thin pancakes” That is a
fair compromise non

RICKY
No Everyone would know I really
meant crepes Now do it Break my
arm Break it you dirty coward

JEAN GIRARD
Why do you want me to break your
arm so badly

RICKY
This is about taking a stand But
being French you wouldn’t

understand that Now break my

arm

JEAN GIRARD
I see no way out of this

The Gentleman twists and breaks Ricky’s arm

RICKY
Ahhhhh 1

His crew and fellow drivers come to his aid

with a pearl-handled pistol There is a MAN next to him in a
turtle neck with a beard

MR DENNIT

EXT DESERTED STREET - SATURDAY MORNING
Ricky and his Dad stand facing his Dad’s muscle car

Alright Dickweed so what’s the
plan

real driving you gotta make friends
with the fear So get in the car

Ricky punches his Dad in the jaw

REESE BOBBY
What the hell was that

RICKY
I got a lot of unresolved anger
towards you So that might just
happen sometimes

Ricky gets in the car He hears a terrible growl and turns
around to see a COUGAR IN THE BACK SEAT Immediately Ricky
jumps out of the car and slams the door

RICKY
What the hell Ahhh There’s a
goddamn cougar in the car

REESE BOBBY
I know there’s a cougar in the car
I put it in there You gotta learn
to drive with the fear And there
is nothing more God damn
frightening than driving with a
live cougar in the car

RICKY
That’s just stupid I could’ve been
killed Where’d you get that thing

REESE BOBBY
I trapped it Been keeping it in my
bathroom at the Motel Feedin it
old pizza Now you get back in that
car You hear me

RICKY

wondrous big cat will be calm But
if you’re scared that beautiful
death machine will do what God made
it to do Namely eat you with a
smile on its face

Beat as Ricky mulls this over He takes a couple really deep
breaths

RICKY
So it really won’t hurt me if I’m
calm Okay okay here goes

can Like you’re making love to
Reba Macintyre and you wanna savor
it

RICKY
How’s this gonna help me get over
the fear

about teaching you that the pedal
to the metal ain’t all there is

Ricky pulls away as slow as he can

Slower You should know every inch
of Reba by the time you’re done

drive with your eyes

RICKY
I really thought I could feel it

INT LUCY’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Lucy is reading to Hank and Williams Jr They are asking her
questions We see she is reading them Faulkner’s The Bear

WILLIAMS JR
But doesn’t the bear symbolize the
old south and the new dog the
encroaching North

HANK
Duh But the question is should
the reader feel relief or sadness
at the passing of the old south

LUCY BOBBY
How about both
HANK
(getting it)
Ahh I get it moral ambiguity

The hallmark of all early twentieth
century American fiction

EXT LUCY’S BACKYARD - THE NEXT DAY

Ricky is asleep in a hammock Suddenly a bucket of water is
thrown onto Ricky’s face He awakes with a start to find his
Dad with a beer in hand standing over him

RICKY
Ah

REESE BOBBY
Where’d stock car racing come from

RICKY
What

His dad throws another bucket of water on him

RICKY
What the hell man

RICKY’S DAD
How’d stock car racing get its
start

RICKY
The rum runners during prohibition
They’d have to have cars fast
enough to outrun the Feds And then
they started racing each other

REESE BOBBY
That’s right

His Dad throws another bucket of water on him

RICKY
Ah If I was right why’d you throw
another bucket on me

REESE BOBBY
Cause I filled up three Now
there’s nothing like driving to
avoid jail Nothing hones your
instincts and mind like necessity

We hear sirens in the distance

REESE BOBBY
So I taped a kilo of cocaine
underneath your car and called the
boys in blue The way I figure it
you got two minutes before they
show up and you do five to ten
Yesterday we went slow Today we go
fast

Ricky flies out of the hammock and into the front yard where
his car is sitting It’s already running

RICKY
You sick crazy old-

We can see the cop cars down the street Ricky has no choice
He jumps in the car and tears off

Reese watches as Ricky drives off Hank and Williams Jr come
up to him

RICKY
But Mama I don’t know if I can be
the best This Frenchman is good

SUSAN

Susan blushes as Lucius lifts the hood to reveal the engine
It’s a wreck Some pieces are missing and it’s a bit rusted

HERSHELL
It looks like a giant robot took a
dump

GLENN

A wise man once said “Adversity is

cheese and fruits while drinking wine Ricky walks up as
they just finish their conversation he’s being escorted by
Jean’s fashionable personal ASSISTANT who is dressed like a
bellhop at the Chateau Marmont

JEAN GIRARD

Everyone laughs really hard

ASSISTANT
Monsieur Girard Ricky Bobby is

know that buster

JEAN GIRARD
The day before a race I like to
stay away from the track Plus
Gregory needs room to train his
world class shepherds

We see Gregory way off in the distance training his shepherds
with intricate whistles and hand commands

JEAN GIRARD
I’m being so incredibly rude This
is my dear friend world famous
cellist Yo-yo Ma

YO-YO MA
Hello Mr Bobby I loved your come-
from-behind win in the Phoenix 400

JEAN GIRARD
And this is Breeze

RICKY

RICKY

Alright man look I just came to
tell you that I’m coming for you
tomorrow And I don’t know what’s
gonna happen as far as first
second or third place But I’m
going to put my heart out on that
track and you better be ready to
deal with it
JEAN GIRARD
Tres bien Ricky Bobby Tres bien
(and then)
Do you know the reason I came to
America

RICKY
Money fame the giant water
parks the same reasons everyone
comes to America

JEAN GIRARD
No I came here for you to beat

me
RICKY

What the hell are you talking

about

JEAN GIRARD
My husband Gregory and I wish only
to retire and train dogs in
Stockholm But before I can do that
I must be defeated by a driver who
is truly better than I am You are
the one Ricky Bobby You can defeat
me

RICKY
So you’re going to lose on purpose

JEAN GIRARD
No I will battle you with the
entirety of my being And you will
probably lose

RICKY
Wow This is like The Highlander

We hear Gregory’s whistle in the distance as the German
Shepherds stand on their hind legs and make a circle

JEAN GIRARD
They are beautiful animals non

RICKY
Those are fine dogs I’m not going
to argue with you

JEAN GIRARD
But make no mistake about it much
Like me those animals will turn
into vicious killers when the
proper command is given For me it
is the start flag For them it is
a randomly chosen command word

RICKY
So like if you say “fire hydrant”
they might go crazy

JEAN GIRARD
How did you Know that word I ask
you how did you Know that word

In an instant we see the dogs stop turn snarl and break out
into a full speed gallop

RICKY
That was just an example Hey look
they’re running over here

JEAN GIRARD
That was the word You said the
word They are coming for you Ricky
Bobby

We see the dogs barking madly running directly for Ricky

RICKY
How did they hear me They’re a
hundred yards away

JEAN GIRARD
They are dogs They have the good
hearing

RICKY
(starting to panic)
What should I do I can’t out run
them What should I do

JEAN GIRARD
Do not panic The one who gave the
attack command must give the heel
command word

RICKY
Well what is it What is it

The dogs are getting close They are going to eat Ricky
Bobby

JEAN GIRARD

ingrained in all Americans to take
risks I mean if we didn’t say
“hey horses suck let’s drive a
