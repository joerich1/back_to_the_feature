RETURN OF THE APES
by Terry Hayes
first draft

DEEP SPACE

No atmosphere no life nothing Just a web of lights- a billion stars hang
in a velvet void The only sound is the howl of the cosmic wind

The light of a distant sun strikes a rising planet We see ragged
continents and oceans wreathed in cloud This is earth rise Our world
spins slowly in space a thing of beauty of awesome majesty In all this
nothingness - life

We push in on the planet - in to the Americas The wind grows louder -
A PUEBLO VILLAGE

A broken-down pick-up bumps into a God-forsaken villagea cluster of adobe
houses blinding flurries of dust and sand The pick-up stops in front of a
crumbling church A man in his 60s gets out carrying a medical bag This is
the DOCTOR

A WOMANS FACE

Screaming Shes very young - a South American Indian - lying on a bed ina
corner of one of the houses She is in the final throes of childbirth a
sheet draped over her loins The Doctor works between her legs encouraging
her in Spanish

The local PRIEST not long out of the seminary crouches at her side
counting off the beads of a rosary He looks like he is about to pass out

SUDDENLY THE WOMAN BITES DOWN HARD ON HER LIP A THIN LINE OF BLOOD COURSES
DOWN HER CHIN THE BREATH EXPLODES FROM HER LUNGS AS SHE PUSHES REALLY HARD

DOCTOR

Arriva

He lifts the child from her loins but it makes no sound We dont see the
baby - just the shock on the Doctors face The mother struggles up to see
her child

The Doctor grabs the sheet from her torso and covers the baby with it He
thrusts the bundle into the Priests hands

DOCTOR (CONTD)
(in Spanish)

Dead - the child is dead Now go
We hold on the mothers anguished face Dissolve to

A HELICOPTER

Off the roof of a tall hospital building As it rises up into the night we
see a red cross painted on its side Its an air ambulance

The chopper turns away The Manhattan skyline every skyscraper a blaze of
lights opens up behind it The chopper swoops over the Brooklyn bridge and
into the night

GROVE OF TREES

Winters coming on - every leaf is a different shade of amber and gold The
helicopter drops down between the branches and lands on an immaculately
tended lawn Surrounding it are the gracious buildings of a great
university Harvard

Two paramedics clamber out of the back of the helicopter and load a
stainless steel casket onto a gurney They wheel it fast towards one of the
buildings As they go through the front doors we hold on a sign etched
into the stone

DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY
A PAIR OF MECHANICAL HANDS

slide a long cylindrical key into the stainless steel casket We pull
back to reveal the casket lies in a sealed uncontaminated room A group of
people in lab coats -scientists and researchers - stare through the glass
walls

A young TECHNICIAN working at a console keyboards in a series of
commands

Sswhish The top of the steel casket swings open Clouds of white gas
stream out -whatevers inside has been nitrogen cooled

The gas clears Lying inside is the body of a newborn child - except that
the baby has the skin the face and the features of a man of eighty The
scientists and the researchers react - shocked

One of the mechanical hands glides towards the baby In its fingers it
holds a long steel scalpel This is the highest-tech autopsy youve ever
seen The scalpel drives down about to open the chest cavity -

BLOOD SPRAYS

But not from the babys chest - its in glass vials exploding as white-hot
flames consume them A plastic-gloved lab assistant silhouetted against
the flames is emptying hospital waste into a furnace He slams the door
shut

He turns we see his face Hes in his 40s handsome in a rough-hewn way - a
strong jaw and a muscular body Theres a cool intelligence in his eyes
but a two-day beard and a worn-out uniform make him look like a man who
between youth and middle-age lost his way And so he has His name is WILL
ROBINSON

He takes a steel trolley wheels it through a set of swing doors and out of
sight

CLOSED CIRCUIT TV SCREEN

features the image of one of the scientists we recognize from the autopsy
Shes in her 30s - attractive long hair left loose on her shoulders an
air of authority about her Her name is BILLIE RAE DIAMOND She is a
Professor of Biology

We tilt down from the screen It hangs from a wall in a deserted laboratory
-overhead lights rows and rows of wire animal cages Moving down death
row feeding the lab animals is Will Robinson

TWO SAD-EYED CHIMPS CLEANING EACH OTHER IN THEIR TINY CAGE TURN AND STARE
AT HIM SUDDENLY WILL STOPS - HES HEARD SOMETHING ON THE SCREEN THAT HAS
CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION HE TURNS AND LOOKS -

DIAMOND

The exact cause of death is still unknown What is certain - were dealing
with something weve never seen before Every organ in the body is
affected

Superimposed over Diamonds face is a three dimensional computer-generated
graphic of the babys body

Will forgets about what hes doing He walks towards the screen We push in
on it Screeds of new data appear

Vascular System Atrophied
Neurological Function Senile dementia
We hold on Wills eyes - he stares at it

AN AUDITORIUM

Billy Rae Diamond stands on a podium continuing her briefing About forty
scientists are sitting in front of her in a dimly-lit lecture hall

Diamond is even more impressive in person - she is tall and gracious but
you dont become a Professor at Harvard at her age without having an iron
will and a sparkling intelligence She speaks with great authority -

DIAMOND (CONTD)

The baby in question Michael James Flanagan -she points at the
computer-generated graphic on a huge screen

was born at New York Hospital yesterday

MAP OF THE WORLD ILLUMINATES AN ADJOINING SCREEN -
DIAMOND

But the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta has received similar reports
from a village in Bolivia two cities in Australia seven countries in
Europe a cluster of cases in Namibia and Mexico Forty-two cases in all

As she speaks pinpoints of light on the map identify the exact locations
They dot their way across the entire globe Dr Diamond turns to face her
audience-

DIAMOND (CONTD)

Like Michael Flanagan they were full-term babies Two hundred and seventy
eight days since conception and yet by all reasonable medical standards
they have completed their entire life cycle They have gone from conception
to death not in three score years and ten but in slightly less than nine
months Michael Flanagan died of old age

Silence as Diamond lets the scientists and researchers absorb it On a
balcony high above another man is taking notes He sits alone almost
hidden in shadow Its Will Robinson

SHEETS OF ICE ON A SHUTTER DOOR
Will crouches in front of a row of self-storage units on the edge of town

Its night the place is deserted He slips a rusted key into a padlock
Snapl The key breaks

Will curses He grabs a piece of timber and pulls a nail out of it He
slides the nail into the padlock and manipulates the tumblers The padlock
springs open

SPIDERS

weave a web in a corner of the storage unit A work light hangs from the
ceiling Will is ripping open stacks of boxes from long ago He puts
together a pile of yellowing files and old floppy disks

PULLS OUT A CASSETTE TAPE AND STARES AT IT UNSURE WHATS ON IT HE TAKES A
CASSETTE PLAYER FROM OUT OF THE JUNK SLIDES IT IN AND PRESSES PLAYA HUGE
ROUND OF APPLAUSE AS IT DIES WE HEAR A MANS VOICE ITS WILL SPEAKING
FROM YEARS AGO -

WILL

(on tape)

I would like to thank the faculty and staff for this great honor

We push in on Wills face as he listens to himself

WILL (CONTD)

have had the opportunity to work with three talented colleagues Im
privileged to also call them my friends -

A shadow of pain crosses his face He shuts off the tape and sits
motionless

LAFAYETTE PARK

Night Homeless people in the park build cardboard shelters against a
coming storm Across the road the first drops of rain splatter against the
White House

A string of Government cars pass through the huge gates and pull up in
front of the West Portico From inside we hear a mans voice -
well-spoken authoritative

PRESIDENT (0S)

Theres no mistake - youre sure

JEFFERSON LIBRARY

Diamond sits in the Presidents study - book-lined walls a fire in the
hearth A group of men sit on the sofasthe Surgeon-General the Chief of
Staff the National Security Advisor the Secretaw of Health A table is
littered with graphs end files

DIAMOND

Weve got five thousand cases now Mr President Thats in three weeks The
number is doubling every hundred and sixty-eight hours

The President stands near a window half in shadow the firelight playing
across his face Hes in his 50s but the strain of office makes him look
older

DIAMOND (CONTD)

Thats a geometric progression sir In three months thereIl be over seven
million cases After that we hit the wall -

She pushes a thick bound volume across the table
DIAMOND (CONTD)
According to this there wont be a live birth on the planet

The President looks at her for a moment Then he reaches down and picks up
the bound volume Its hundreds of pages of numbers and projections

PRESIDENT

These are just computer projections -
species dont disappear that fast
DIAMOND

Tell that to the dinosaurs sir

He looks out the window at the winter storm sweeping down on them
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR

What date - when exactly do we hit this wall
DIAMOND

Six months and twenty-one days

Silence The President keeps looking out the window
PRESIDENT

Cant somebody tell me - what exactly are we dealing with Is it a virus or
what

DIAMOND

We dont know sir

The President turns to the Chief of Staff
PRESIDENT

Whatever they need Bob - anything Harry Truman put together the Manhattan
Project - you understand

The Chief of Staff nods his head - yes

PRESIDENT (CONTD)

(softly)

A world without children -its inconceivable And what about the rest of us
- what do we do Just sit and watch our species die Will the last person

to leave the planet turn out the lights

Silence again Finally a young woman - the White House Press Secretary -
speaks

PRESS SECRETARY

Were going to have to manage the public Right now the truth may be
inoperative -

PRESIDENT

Of course were going to have to manage itl Were going to have to manage a
whole lot of things But cant we take at least one moment to be human

He looks around the room We hold on their somber faces
A CHEAP APARTMENT
Through the window - the neon sign of a gas station This is Wills place

He lives alone - a bed in the corner run-down furniture dishes in the
sink
The kitchen table has been turned into a desk - Will sits at an old
computer surrounded by the yellowing stacks of files and floppy disks He
stares at the screen - the notes and equations are blurred Hes been at
this so long he can barely focus He rubs his hand across his eyes

A small mewing sound Will turns to an alcove in the corner - a cat lies in
a basket panting Will goes to her

Shes giving birth - the first of her new-born kittens lies next to her
Will strokes the mothers head looking at the miracle of new life He puts
his fingers in a water bowl about to moisten the mothers mouth

Then he stops He looks again at the kitten - theres two of them now A
beat as he just stares -

WILL

(softly)

Jesus Christ of course

A LUXURIOUS BATHROOM

Through frosted glass we see the silhouette of a woman taking a shower
Whoever she is shes got a great figure The sound of a doorbell The
shower door opens -Diamond sticks her head out She looks at a clock - its
almost midnight

VIDEO ENTRY PHONE

A video screen monitors the front door On it we see Will - his hair
tousled an old overcoat buttoned to the neck a battered briefcase under
his arm

Diamond - a towel around her shoulders hair dripping - picks up the phone
DIAMOND

Who is it

WILL (0S)

Will Robinson

DIAMOND

I think you have the wrong house

WILL (0S)

I work at the department

He turns and looks straight into the camera Instinctively Diamond covers
her breasts She looks at him - recognition dawns

AN ELEGANT ROOM
Will and Diamond sit in the living room of a gracious townhouse - wooden
floors and beautiful rugs Diamond doesnt wear any make-up -just jeans and
an oversized shirt She looks even more beautiful It does nothing to ease
Wills nerves Hes got his briefcase open in front of him speaking from
sheaves of notes and papers

DIAMOND
(interrupting)

Hold on - how do you know about the case load The Governments trying to
manage this - theyve withheld that information

WILL

The Internet Doctor Its a highway - you can ride it anywhere you want I
got into the Center for Disease Control I had a look at their raw data

DIAMOND

Jesus Do you know what youre doing This is the White House were talking
about

WILL
(Heated) )

No its a disease and it doesnt come any worse than this - thats what
were talking about

HE LOOKS AWAY CALMING HIMSELF HE SHUFFLES HIS NOTES HE SPEAKS AGAIN
QUIETLY -

WILL

Ive listened at the lab - I think I know where youre looking Bacterias
mostly but theres a strong push into the retro-viruses Youre wrong
Doctor

DIAMOND

Really - and I thought I was arrogant But then Im just a professor
WILL

No virus or bacteria has ever discriminated on the grounds of sex
DIAMOND

I can think of one

WILL

Sure it can start in pockets but it never stays there This thing does It

only affects women of child-bearing age What - its so smart it can
recognize motherhood I dont think so No this is into the very heart of
what we are This is genetic This is part of the DNA
DIAMOND

Thank you A hundred thousand genes make up human DNA - that really narrows
it down

WILL

As a matter of fact it does Theres only one part of the DNA thats passed
exclusively through women Thirty-seven genes the oldest part of the human
organism -

DIAMOND

(realizing)

The mitochondrial DNA

WILL

Over the years theres been speculation -not all of it crazy either - that
somehow it triggers aging He slides a sheaf of yellowing extracts from
scientific journals across the table She doesnt pay them any attention -
shes thinking

DIAMOND

You realize what youre saying dont you A bacteria - I think wed get it
for sure A virus -youd have to say weve got a chance But say youre
right The mitochondrial DNA - thats so far out on the frontier we can
barely see it

WILL

Like I said - it doesnt get any worse than this

She keeps staring down at the documents and notes lying on the table A
beat

WILL (CONTD)

Are you okay

DIAMOND

Sure

WILL LOOKS AT HER FOR A MOMENT -
WILL

Shit Youre pregnant arent you
DIAMOND

Nine weeks
THEIR EYES MEET - SHE SHRUGS TRYING TO PUT A BRAVE FACE ON IT SHE GETS TO
HER FEET -

DIAMOND

Do you want a drink - coffee a sandwich or something
WILL

(Recoiling)

Nono Im fine thanks

Watches as he picks up his papers and puts them back in his battered
briefcase

AN EMPTY STREET

Its late at night Will clutches his briefcase under his arm heading
home A bitter wind blows out of the north He looks a lonely and forlorn
figure as he makes his way through the pools of light cast by the
streetlights

CONVOY OF NASA TRUCKS

RUMBLE THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING - THE CITY IS JUST WAKING THE TRUCKS
DOZENS OF WHITE EIGHTEEN-WHEELERS TURN THROUGH THE FRONT GATES OF HARVARD
THEY STOP IN FRONT OF THE GROVE OF TREES WE CRANE UP FROM THEM TO A WINDOW
IN THE BIOLOGY BUILDING -

HAND HITS A TABLE

ITS DIAMOND - SHES ANGRY BREAKFAST TRAYS CLUTTER THE TABLE -SHES IN THE
MIDDLE OF A CONFERENCE WITH A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS SHE GLARES AT AN
ARROGANT YOUNG NEUROLOGIST -

DIAMOND

Its just an idea Bob All were doing is taking it for a walk around the
block

A man in his 60s - distinguished diplomatic - intercedes

DE MAUPASSANT

There was a lot of work done on it in the 70s I cant recall the details
but someone had the idea that mitochondriel DNA was like a genetic memory
If you could unlock it you could physically travel back down it Through
evolution - like a time machine

BOB

Wowl Those 70s man Im really sorry I missed them

Everyone - Diamond included - laughs
OLD PHOTOS OF A SAILING BOAT

They hang on the wall of a tiny room - not an office just a
hole-in-the-wall Will has turned into his own He sits at a table making
notes A knock - Diamond enters

DIAMOND

I thought youd like to know - were looking at mitochondrial DNA

WILL

Thanks for telling me

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER ITS AN AWKWARD MOMENT - NEITHER ONE QUITE SURE
WHETHER OR HOW TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION DIAMOND SEES THE PHOTOS -

DIAMOND
Is that you

She points at a man in his 20s standing on the deck in one of the photos
Will nods

DIAMOND (CONTD)

Seattle Is that where you went to school

Will hesitates - we sense that he doesnt really want to answer
WILL

No Princeton

DIAMOND

Expensive

WILL

A scholarship Then I did some post-graduate work I never really
finished

Something in the way Will says it - some sense of loss - makes Diamond
pause She recovers and looks in her wallet She pulls out a photograph and
hands it to Will It shows a small sailing boatgaff-rigged and a varnished
hull

WILL (CONTD)

Its a Kestrel 24 - I havent seen one of those in years Shes a beautiful
boati

DIAMOND

My grandfather left it to me I dont sail it much any more - its too hard
to find a foretd hand
WILL

What about your husband - doesnt he sail

DIAMOND

I dont know - I havent met him yet

WILL LOOKS AT HER HIS EXPRESSION SAYS IT - WHAT SHE SHRUGS -
DIAMOND

I wanted a baby but Im thirty-four-years old Sooner or later you realize
that somewhere along the way youve missed the man youve been waiting for

WILL

What did you do - ask a friend

DIAMOND

I thought of it

WILL

Lucky friend

DIAMOND

I went to a clinic Not exactly romantic but it worked
(pauses)

Good idea bad timing

WILL

How many people have you put on the mDNA

DIAMOND

Seven

WILL

Thats all

DIAMOND

Thats all I can spare Its just a theory -one of dozens of theories
Will looks away in disgust

DIAMOND (CONTD)

What is it with you - its not just science is it Why are you so
passionate about this

WILL

I know Im right Its a mutation A hundred thousand years its probably
been lying there -shifting weaving into the mDNA You either go back and
change evolution or you engineer it out Seven peopleYou might as well
shoot peas at a dam

DIAMOND

You havent answered my question - why so passionate

WILL

The questions not relevant The only thing Im interested in is the
science

He turns back to his work We hear the door close as Diamond leaves

A GEODESIC DOME

White space-age is being erected on the lawn Workmen are unloading the
NASA trucks We pull back through a high window of the Biology building A
woman stands there looking out Her name is KRIS McQUADE This is her
office -

MCQUADE

You want to tell me whats going on

She turns and looks at Diamond sitting on the other side of the desk

DIAMOND

Dont ask Kris Id have to lie and I dont want to do that to my best
friend

MCQUADE

The rumor is youve done something really big They say the Defense
Department is taking it over

Diamond just sits there staring straight ahead McQuade waits Finally -
MCQUADE (CONTD)

Okay okay - Im sorry I asked So what about this guy - whats he done
DIAMOND

He hasnt done anything - Im just interested

MCQUADE

Ten thousand employment records Ive got on file and you want to know about
a lab assisant
DIAMOND

The smartest assistant Ive ever known
MCQUADE

What - he can mop and fart at the same time

She picks up pages from a computer printer - including a copy of Wills
photo ID

MCQUADE (CONTD)

Hes handsome at least Ill say -

(a thought strikes her)

Jesus - youre not interested in him like that are you
DIAMOND

No but hes the most unbelievable smelling man

MCQUADE

Smelling Youre pregnant - obviously your hormones have gone crazy What
exactly does he smell like

DIAMOND
You know
(searching for the right word)
- wholesome
MCQUADE
Of course he does - thats the Lysol

Diamond laughs but McQuade barely notices it Shes leafing through WiUs
file -

MCQUADE (CONTD)

Thats strange - theres supposed to be a background sheet Family school
-all that shit It must have gotten lost

Before Diamond can say anything a young man enters Hes McQuadas
assistant

ASSISTANT
Your secretarys on the line Dr Diamond Theres a call for you

DIAMOND
Tell her to take a message

ASSISTANT

Its the New York Times

MCQUADE

What do they want

DIAMOND

I think Washingtons news management just went south

THE WHITE HOUSE

Night Scores of television news vans are parked outsideDutch Japanese and
French reporters are doing stand-ups live-to-air We hear Peter Jennings of
ABC

JENNINGS (0S)

Were standing by to go live to Washington as events continue to unfold on
this remarkable day I dont think theres a person anywhere whos not
sitting by a radio or television now Im told the President is on his way
to the press room —

FIFTH AVENUE

is totally empty - just a young man on rollerblades He skates effortlessly
down the deserted avenue - past Tiffanys and the Trump Tower all silent
now

PRESIDENT (0S)

My fellow Americans

The rollerblader passes the cathedral of St John The front doors are open
Someone is playing the organ - Mozarts Requiem The rollerblader fades
into the night

STEEL DOOR OPENS

A sharp-faced caretaker - scruffy clothes and a limp - escorts Will into a
vaulted basement All we can see are silhouettestowers of crates racks of
equipment

CARETAKER

This used to be the basement of the Psychology Department We just sort of
stacked everything around ‘em -

He flicks a switch - the storage room floods with light He points at two
long iron cylinders - like small submarines - rigged up to a series of
valves and pipes
CARETAKER (CONTD)

Flotation tanks They used em for experiments in sensory degradation -

WILL

Deprivation - sensory deprivation
CARETAKER

Yeah well - whatever

SHAFT OF LIGHT

WILL OPENS AN IRON HATCH THAT GIVES ACCESS INTO ONE OF THE TANKS HE DROPS
INTO IT AND WALKS FORWARD EXAMINING IT THE DARKNESS CLOSES AROUND HIM HE
STARES AHEAD VOICES DRIFT OUT OF MEMORY -

YOUNG MAN (0S)

Now I know what a mole feels like -

YOUNG WOMAN (0S)

(lightly)

It feels like a fucking coffin thats what it feels like

Other voices laugh Theyre all young and like the young they think theyll
never die

CARETAKER (0S)
Hey fella - what are you doing

HES PEERING DOWN THROUGH THE HATCH WILL DRAGS HIMSELF OUT OF THE PAST HE
TURNS -

WILL

Just looking Ill be coming back - Ill need a key

The caretaker shrugs - sure Will climbs out of the tank

WILL (CONTD)

One other thing - dont tell anyone huh

CARETAKER

Who would I tell They treat me like shit Worse than shit All work no
appreciation The phantom of Harvard Someone should write a fucking
musical about me

CIRCLES OF LIGHT

Desk lamps glowing in an office Diamond and a team of researchers are
working through piles of old journals and extracts from scientific papers
RESEARCHER

Heres another one - Mitochondrial DNAA Map to the Past

DIAMOND

Whos it by

RESEARCHER

Same guy - Doctor Robert Plant

DIAMOND

Jesus what did this guy do - write the book on it Who is he

HUGE BOOK BEING OPENED

Its a scientific directory The researcher flicks the pages and stops at
Plant

RESEARCHER

Wow - I thought your career was impressive
Diamond looks up from her reading
RESEARCHER (CONTD)

Degrees in medicine and microbiology A PhD at 24 a member of the Academy
of Sciences published twenty times by 1974

DIAMOND

And then

RESEARCHER

Then nothing

DIAMOND REACTS SHE GETS TO HER FEET COMING CLOSER -
DIAMOND

Where did he go as an undergraduate
RESEARCHER

Princeton

DIAMOND

On a scholarship

A CORRIDOR
Its late at night The scientists and their staff are working around the
clock Will wheels a trolley laden with bottles vials and catheters down
a crowded corridor Diamond pushes through the people behind trying to
catch up to him Scientists turn to speak to her but she ignores them
DIAMOND (CONTD)

Robert

Will keeps walking heading for an elevator Diamond skirts around a knot
of people

DIAMOND (CONTD)

Doctor Plant

Will hesitates - one split second - then keeps going The elevator doors
slide open Will steps in turns and hits a button He watches Diamond
pushing towards him For a moment their eyes meet She comes closer
Sswhish The doors slide shut

DIAMONDS OFFICE

She sits behind her desk listening to the chief of campus security

SECURITY OFFICER

The equipment you saw him with was taken from three labs It includes a
range of genetic material-

(hands her an inventory)

Weve checked all the buildings your team is using - hes not in any of
them

DIAMOND

What about hie house
SECURITY OFFICER

He asked his landlady to look after his cat She hasnt seen him for three
days

IN THE BASEMENT

theres a make-shift bed and a hot-plate with a battered saucepan Next to
it is a rack of medical equipment and laboratory vials

Will is sitting in front of three computers running in parallel - data and
equations reel across them The caretaker comes out of the shadows
carrying two mugs of thick coffee He puts one down next to Will -

CARETAKER

You wanna tell me what exactly youre doing
WILL
Looking for a date

The caretaker stares at the confusion of diagrams and equations on the
screen —-

CARETAKER

Whats wrong with a calendar

WILL

These are chemical sequences - they represent human genes By following a
trail of mutations I can date them Im trying to find out when a major

change occurred in something called the mitochondrial DNA

CARETAKER

The mitochondrial DNA Yeah well that makes sense

But Will barely hears it Suddenly hes leaning forward keyboarding in
complex commands The caretaker watches him -

CARETAKER (CONTD)

Youve found it

WILL

Maybe

He has illustrations of two long-chain molecules on the screen He moves
them together Aa they overlap we see theyre not identical - the tail of
one kicks upwarda Will starel at it -

WILL (CONTD)

(softly)

Yeah - Ive found it

CARETAKER

So - whats the date

Will presses a key Faster than the eye can follow the first long-chain
molecule starts to shift and mutate Finally it resolves itself into the
second molecule Will looks at a graph on the side of the screen -

WILL

The best computer science can do One hundred and two thousand years ago

CARETAKER
Sort of what I figured - give or take a day or two

DIAMONDS OFFICE

Diamond is poring through scientific articles written by Will She flicks a
page -theres a photo of Will 20 years younger surrounded by three
colleagues Hes got his arm around one of them - an attractive young

woman

Diamond lifts the photo looking at it more closely She starts to read the
caption We push in on it and hold on the words UC Berkeley

WE ARE FLYING

swooping and soaring - through a weird landscape of towering cliffs
tumbling streams and primordial forest Theres something unreal about it -
we pull back to reveal theyre computer-generated images playing on the

screens in the basement

The caretaker has pulled up a chair He and Will are watching the images
generated by a CD-ROM

WILL

This is someones version of the prehistoric world Im interested in the
geography the atmosphere -that sort of stuff

CARETAKER

Where are we

WILL

Africa - thats where Mankind started

Will keeps looking at the strange images The caretaker gets to his feet -
CARETAKER

Ill see you in the morning

WILL

Yeah

The caretaker limps towards the door Will looks up -
WILL (CONTD)

Thank you - for helping me I mean

CARETAKER

It sounds like youre leaving or something

WILL
No I just wanted to say it thats all
The caretaker keeps looking at him -
CARETAKER

What exactly are you doing Youre a bit old to try and make your mark
arent you Anyway nobody listens to people like us

WILL

Fate can be kind - sometimes a man gets a second chance Do you know what
its like to be ridiculed to have your ideas thrown back in your face And
that was the easy part I guess thats what Im doing - I want to prove
that I was right

CARETAKER

Youre lying to me

WILL

What do you mean

CARETAKER

You are going somewhere I dont know where it is Im not even sure I can
imagine it Good luck though I hope you find whatever it is youre
looking for

WILL

Thanks

CARETAKER

No point in getting you breakfast huh

Will shakes his head - no They smile at each other The caretaker turns
and goes

DIAMONDS OFFICE

Diamond looks up from the papers and articles littering her desk Her
Secretary stands in the doorway -

SECRETARY
Ive got Eleanor Wilkins on the phone She runs the archives at Berkeley
DIAMOND
(into phone)
Ms Wilkins

We push in tight on Diamonds face as she listens Anxiety and alarm
register on it
OUTER OFFICE

The security officer and several of his men are looking at maps of the
campus Researchers and scientists have gathered in the office rumors are
flying Everyone turns - Diamond stands in the doorway to her office She
looks at deMaupassant

DIAMOND (CONTD)

You were right Luc That work you remembered from Berkeley - he was the
one that did it He said man was the last step on an evolutionary trail
Within every one of us is the history of our race Its imprinted on our
genes - like a map Anyone that can find the chemical key can travel back
down it Through the womb Through time and space -

(she looks at them all)

Thats what hes doing Hes going back Hes going to try and change
evolution

SECURITY OFFICER
Is that possible
DIAMOND

He was the best of his generation He thinks so Hes got the genetic
material for the key All he needs are flotation tanks

THE FLOTATION TANKS

The valves are open - warm water is pouring into the tanks

Will sits next to the rack of medical equipment beads of sweat on his
forehead He slides a syringe into his forearm and inserts a catheter He
opens a series of tiny valves on the glass vials A cocktail of fluid -
minutely measured doses - flows down the clear plastic towards his arm The
fluid hits his blood stream and drains into it

A LONG CORRIDOR

Diamond and the others run fast through pools of light cast by naked bulbs
Ahead -a pair of swing doors -

BOB

A theorys one thing - do you really think hell try it

DIAMOND

Hes spent fifteen years as a lab assistant He lives in a two room walk-up
with a cat No family no friends Whats Theres left for him here Of

course hell do it

Smack They push through the doors into another corridor
AN IRON LADDER

Will climbs up the side of the flotation tank Suddenly he stops - a
tremor a rippling wave passes from his feet to his head Its his muscles
contracting It wracks him with pain He gasps at the intensity of it

Smash The steel door into the basement shudders as someone tries to get
in Will looks up - the door twists and moves His vision is starting to
distort He grabs the access hatch and swings through -

Splashl He drops into the water Clang He closes the hatch

Barn The steel door flies open The security officer lowers a sledge
hammer Diamond steps in end throws a light switch

DARKNESS IN THE TANK

Will floats on his back the only sound is the rapid thump of his
heartbeat The water sloshes back and forth - his muscles are going into
spasms We push along his body - up to his face His eyes roll back into
his headl

All we see are the whites of them They shatter into a web of capillaries -

WILLS POV

red mist swirls in front of him It resolves itself into a web of
interwoven tendrils -the double helix of the DNA molecule Will starts to
travel through it -

INSIDE THE TANK

Will is morphing shedding cells - were losing him in the warm dark fluid
of the tank Its like the womb His body seems to be disintegrating
dissolving into it Water flows through the sockets where his eyes once
were

His hollow mouth opens From far away we hear him scream - a primal scream
OUTSIDE THE TANK

Not a sound escapes The security officer is about to try and open the
hatch

DIAMOND (0S)

No

The security officer turns - Diamond is holding the catheter in her hand
DIAMOND (CONTD)

If we open the hatch I think well kill him Its too late - its his
journey hes going to have to take it

INSIDE THE TANK
Wills body is like a shadow almost one with the water growing less
distinct by the moment What is left of his face - a strange shifting

shape - floats towards us Closer closer It melts completely into the
water -
WILLS POV

He spirals down a tunnel - into a whirlpool of white light As he hits it
shatters into a million fragments of light It looks like a comet wheeling
through the heavens A cosmic wind blows it forward Will is traveling
through space and time -

OUTSIDE THE TANK

Diamond and the others are gathered around the computers Bob is working
the keyboard Diamond is lookingthrough the piles of papers notes and
star charts

DIAMOND

Everythings here - he kept a record of every step He can even tell the
date -forty hours after he arrives theres a solar eclipse

BOB
Billie - theres a note for you

Diamond looks over his shoulder at the computer screen She reads what is
written -

DIAMOND

I wont be here but if I solve this thing make sure you tell them
Billie Tell them it was Robert Plant Doctor Robert Plant of UC Berkeley

THE FRAGMENTS OF LIGHT

blaze through the heavens They draw together changing and reconstituting
into a shape we recognize - the interwoven strands of DNA molecules The
strands connect A blast of light Its the rays of -

THE SUN

streaming into a cave Will lies in the fetal position bleeding from his

nose and ears The light grows stronger - its dawn Will drags himself up
and stumbles towards the entrance We tilt up from him He doesnt see it
but we do - prehistoric cave paintings are etched into the rock

A CRAGGY PEAK

Will steps out of the cave Sunrise sweeps over a world born brand new -
plains and jungle and primordial forest Rising above it is a snow-capped
mountain that looks like Kilamlnjlro A ragged gash runs across the earth -
a rift valley Will stares at it He raises his face to the sun He did it
The first steps over - and he did itl He looks down - rising out of the
valley is a tiny pillar of smoke
A FOREST CLEARING

In the middle are the smoldering remains of a camp-fire Will moves
cautiously towards it He stops - several bodies terribly mangled lie on
the ground

Will turns one of them over - hes got matted hair a heavy brow anda
short muscular body As primitive as he is theres no doubt of his
species He is a man A Paleolithic man

This was a hunting party -scattered weapons and the trussed carcasses of
dead animals lie nearby For a moment Will thinks the hunters must have
been torn apart by wild animals Then he looks up into the trees - more
bodies of the hunters But no animal did this - they hang from iron chains
left there as some sort of trophy Or a warning

CRUSHED LEAVES AND BROKEN PLANTS

Will is following a tiny trail through the forest Hes taken what is
useful from the bodies of the hunters - an otter-skin water bag two
short-handled spears and a bed-roll made from an animal pelt He moves on -
deeper into the shadows of the forest

A SPARKLING STREAM

Will splashes through the crystal water He looks upstream - a small lake
A flock of strange birds - like huge flamingos take flight in a blaze of
pink and gold

He steps out of the stream and along a path beneath a canopy of
over-arching trees We hold on his feet - whip He triggers something A
net of woven vines engulfs him He drops the spears and bedroll Suddenly
hes soaring through the air

He jerks to a halt - hes a netted animal hanging high in the trees The
faces of two Paleolithic men crouched on boughs stare at him

PLUME OF WATER

cascades a hundred feet into a hidden gorge Smoke curls up from fires
Scores of stone-age people - man women and children - turn and look Will
roped and bound is being hauled into the encampment

The primitive people - nervous but intrigued - circle around him They are
dressed in skins and fur talismans hang from their necks The warriors
carry not only weapons but ritual scars across their foreheads It makes
them look even more savage

Will is led past the haunches of soma massive animal cooking in a pit A
pile of ivory tusks lie nearby The two captors jerk on the leash - it
stops Will in front of a cave Hanging from the roof is the giant pelt and
head of their totema saber-toothed tiger This is the Tribe of the Tiger

A man emerges from under its outstretched paws Hes in his late 20s -
proud and strong His name is Kip-Kena - he is their leader He and Will
look at one another
Kip uses his hands to sign to Will in the formal language of his race Will
stares at him - he has no idea what it means He shrugs Kip tries a new
tack - he speaks The sounds are rough and guttural - but understandable
KiP Where is your tribe

Will pauses searching for an answer- where do you start He gives up

WILL

I dont have a tribe

A rolling murmur of disbelief from the surrounding tribe

KIP

No man can live without a tribe How would he hunt the mighty animals Who
would keep his fire burning

WILL

I come from far away Im a traveler

KIP
What is traveler Is that a tribe

Again Wills at a loss Something catches Kips eye He reaches forward and
rips the water bag out from under Wills coat The tribe reacts -

KIP (CONTD)

You carry things taken from our hunters Kill him
He turns away Will throws himself at him -

WILL

No

Whackl A blow to the back of Wills neck knocks him to his knees He looks
up -two warriors have their spears raised about to plunge them into his
chest

A sound like thunder - its hooves The warriors turn Will follows their
gaze - half an army mounted on horseback surges into the gorge They are
heavily armed dressed in armor but its not their weaponry that astonishes
Will These are apes

The tribes-people scream in terror They turn and run The two warriors
forget about Will He dives for cover in a pile of rocks As he tears
himself free of the ropes that bind him he looks out -

The apes charge in to the camp At their head is a huge gorillarippling
muscles and intelligent eyes - deep set and yellow like pissholes in the
snow He wears a suit of black armor ribbed in silver His name is Drak He
is the Lord of the High Rivers supreme commander of the ape army On
either side ride his elite Praetorian Guard

Woo-woo-woo Kip swings a hollow piece of wood above his head Its a
bull-roarer The warriors of the tribe know its meaning - they rally to
Kips side Armed only with spears and primitive bows they stand between
the apes and their panic-driven people trying to buy them time to get into
the cave

Sswhish The sound of arrows The apes carry triple-barreled iron
crossbows

Short iron bolts cut several of the tribesmen down Dust and smoke swirls
across the camp Kip and his men fighting all the way retreat towards the
cave

A babys cry Will turns - a toddler sits at a hearth left behind in the
confusion Will half rises to his feet about to go for him Too late -
theres a blur of movement irt the trees A tribe-boy - too young to be a
warrior - has come back for the child

Out of the dust and smoke - Drak Foam flies from his horses mouth Hes
seen the boy and the child He locks what looks like a Gatling gun tight
under his huge bicep

Will screams a warning The boy turns - he sees Drak as he fires A hail of
iron darts - twenty or more - cut him and the child down

Rage flashes in Wills eyes He scrambles over a boulder and rips a
crossbow from a dead apes hand He slides bolts into the barrels and grabs
a lever with both hands -you need the strength of an ape to cock it A
sound behind him - little more than a whisper He swings -Its an arrow
Whackl It rips into his shoulder hurling him to the ground Ape infantry -
foot soldiers - are coming into the gorge behind him

In their midst are three huge steam-driven machines - like iron erector
sets One is the Claw one is the Balls and the other is the Flame

THE CAVE ENTRANCE

Kip and his warriors have seen them too They scramble into the cave Men
and women are inside swinging closed two huge stockade doors made from
tree trunks

Other warriors caught outside run for the closing gap On their heels is
Will - still clutching the crossbow blood streaming from his wound The
doors are closing closing Will dives through the gap almost crushed -

INSIDE THE CAVE

Slam The doors fly shut Wham A huge cross-beam drops into place Will
sprawled in the dust looks up - chaos By torchlight the medicine man is
tending the wounded children are screaming women and old people are
clambering up a series of ledges High above is a tiny slash of
daylightanother entrance

From deep in the cave Will hears the roar of some animal but he doesnt
have time to think about it Smash The great wooden doors shudder from
some mighty blow
OUTSIDE THE DOORS

The three machines are in place The first of them has two huge stone balls
suspended by chains from an overhead jib An ape sits right on top
operating it The balls dance and swing wildly - smash They hit the door
opening a hole

INSIDE THE CAVE

Daylight streams in Kip and his warriors have ranged themselves high
around the walls ready to attack when the apes pour in A pair of huge
iron jaws appear in the hole This is the second of the apes machines -
the Claw

Another roar from the animal Will watches the Claw reach in and grab the
massive crossbeam It snaps it like a twig Will gets to his feet and runs
He sees Kip signal -

AN OLD WARRIOR

is perched high on a series of wooden bars that seal off a corner of the
cave turning it into a cage He opens it

Crash The stockade doors at the front of the cave burst open The first of
the ape cavalry charges in A roar from the unseen animal The apes horses
catch the scent of it They whinny in terror

Will stares as a blur of striped fur and muscle flies out of the cage The
tribes totem is a living thing - the saber-toothed tiger ia three times
the size of its Bengal cousin a head the size of an ox and two ten-inch
teeth curved down either side of its jaw

The horses are bucking and rearing The tiger leaps towards the door
heading for freedom A dismounted ape raises his weapon The tiger doesnt
even break stride One lazy swipe from his paw tears open the armor and
flesh of the apes chest

Will can smell the animals breath as it flies past An ape officer still
on his horse turns - another swipe from thetigers paw rips out his
throat

Kip and his warriors hurl their spears and stone tomahawks at the cavalry -
half of them dismounted all of them in disarray The tiger runs soars
through the doorway -

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Drak fights to control his mount as the tiger lands once and bounds into
the forest

ON THE LEDGES

Kips men are fighting as they retreat heading towards the opening at the
roof of the cave Will clutching his wounded shoulder makes his own way
up the wall
Beneath him Drak and the apes roll in the third of the machines - a long
iron tube in a rolling superstructure Feeding it are a series of
oil-filled bladders One of the apes touches a torch to a firing hole A
tongue of fire erupts from the end of the tube Its a flame thrower -The
fiery tongue shoots up towards the roof of the cave The flame engulfs two
warriors Skin blazing they plummet to the ground

The flame thrower fires again - scorching the rock wall filling the cave
wit a pall of smoke It hits the tiny patch of daylight cutting off
escape

Will - trapped - runs along a ledge over a pile of rocks and jumps Into
mid-air He lands on the back of a riderless horse and drives his heels
into its flanks

The apes and the surviving warriors turn For a moment they just stare -
nobodys ever seen a human ride a horse before Will flies towards the
entrance He sees Kip on a ledge just above battling three huge apes

WILL

Jump

Kip sees Will galloping towards him One of the apes raises a double-bladed
sword Kip jumps sprawling across the horses neck grabbing on to its

flowing mane

Drak stares at Will - hes never seen anything like him He wheels his
horse around and spurs it forward in pursuit

OUTSIDE THE CAVE

Wills horse bursts out of the cave - past the Claw and under the Balls
The apes turn and look - astonished They scramble for their horses Drak
charges through

Will hurtles towards the trees Kip hanging on for life looks behind -
Drak raises his Gatling gun and aims Kip wrenches Wills head down - zing

The arrows skim past

Drak cant outpace them - and he cant re-load at the gallop either They
charge out of the camp into -

THE DAPPLED LIGHT OF THE FOREST

Drak rises up in the stirrups and hauls himself on to the saddlethe huge
ape stands on the back of the charging horse

He jumps - his rippling arms catch hold of an overhanging bough He swings
himself up into the tree - he is an ape after all He throws himself from

branch to bough traveling at incredible speed

Will glances back - he sees Draks riderless horse His eyes dart in
confusion -where is he We crane up - hes in the trees above Drak jumps -

Wham Hundreds of pounds of gorilla blast into Wills shoulder lifting him
out of the saddle and hurling him to the ground
Kip hauls down on the horses bridle - wheeling the stallion around

Will looks up from the dust - Drak towers above him Will sees Kip coming
back -

WILL (CONTD)
Run

A volley of arrows whiz past Kip - other apes are galloping through the
trees Kip grabs the bridle and kicks - the horse spins and gallops away

massive armor-clad paw grabs Wills head He looks straight into Draks
face The ape reaches out and rips a claw down Wills cheek Will tries to
stifle the scream Drak touches the wound and tastes the blood -

DRAK

So - its human after ell

He spits the blood out in revulsion Will stares into the piu-holes in his
face Never has he seen eyes so cold

Will tries to rise to hie feet His wounded shoulder has weakened him - he
staggers Draks clenched fist clad in chain mail drives straight et
Wills jaw Smashl Fade to black

THE WORLD UPSIDE DOWN
Its Wills point of view - he-s lying on his back in a horse-drawn cart

Hes very weak his shirt drenched in blood He rolls over and the image
rights itself

He drags himself on to all fours but he cant get any further - his legs
are chained

WILL

(fevered disoriented)

Where the fuck am I

Will looks up - a huge ape sits guard in the back of the wagon

GUARD

(smiling)

The end of the road

Will - confused panicky - grabs the side of the cart and hauls himself to
his knees He looks past an escort of ape cavalry - they are traveling down
an avenue of idols -towering statues of apes sculpted out of stone old as

ages past Fires burn somewhere within them giving the eyes a red
flickering glow
Will turns away Behind him he sees humans rows of them - dead - hanging
upsidl down from long poles like trophies

Everything comes flooding back - he slumps against the side of the cart
eyes barely focused Blood trickles down under his shirt and forms a pool
between his legs He doesnt even notice it

MASSIVE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

spans a roaring river Drak and his convoy clatter across it We crane up -
laid out before is a city Terraces are cut into both sides of a jagged
ravine Opening on to them are caves and houses and buildings made out of
stone

Apes are everywhere - hammering stones to enlarge a house chattering in
the trees swinging hand-over-hand along horizontal ladders - crossing from
one side of the ravine to the other

Will has roused himself He stares at the city through feverish eyes - to
him it appears to float Buildings swim in and out of focus His shoulders

shake - he starts to laugh an edge of hysteria to it

WILL

A city of course Ape city Ive destroyed my mind Or maybe Im dead
and this is Gods last joke - hell is ruled by apes

Whhish - the end of a whip sails through the air Crack It hits Wills
back doubling him over

GUARD
Quiet animal
RIPPLES OF WATER

run across the surface of a beautiful pool A black shape glides along
underwater The head breaks the surface - its an old gorilla the fur on
his face gray and balding This is NAZGUL He is the Ghan - the President -
of the Council of Elders

He walks out of the water Other old apes - all male their days of warring
and building over - lie around the pool Several of them draped only in
rough loin-cloths groom each other picking nits out of their fur

The sound of a gong Nazgul picks up a loin cloth and walks the end of the
pool He looks straight down the ravine - at the far end Drak and his
troop come into view

NAZGUL

The raiders are home

OLD APE

(lazily)
Good hunting

Nazgul squints against the sun He sees the poles carrying the dead humans
NAZGUL

By the look of it

GRAY-BEARDED WARRIOR HIS CHEST MARKED BY THE SCARS OF MANY BATTLES GETS
UP -

GRAY BEARD

(proudly)

Not as good as when we rode the high ridges Ill warrant
NAZGUL

Times are different now Back then a could go out and come back with a
brace of animals Theyre far scarcer now -

OLD APE

Not scarce enough I say

Theres a murmur of agreement from the other apes
A TINY BOAT

is wreathed in woven leaves Lying in it is the dead body of a young ape
The boat drifts down an underground stream All around it rise the stone
walls of a huge cavern Torches light up the gloom - this place is a
temple

A group of apes - mourners - walk along a path keeping pace with the
funeral boat

They make a humming sound deep in the back of their throats - a dirge for
the dead

At the head of the procession swinging a smoking censer is an ape wearing
a lion-skin cloak His face is scarred and twisted - he has one cruel eye
the other is just an empty socket Beneath the cloak one arm and a leg are
withered The whole effect rather than diminishing his power enhances it
His name is MA-GOG He is high priest of the apes defender of the faith
keeper of the Book of the Lore

The funeral boat gathers speed in the current It thrusts towards sunlight
pouring through an arch

A ROCK PLATFORM

The mourners step through the arch and on to a slab of rock We pull back
to reveal where they stand - a huge crouching ape has been carved out of
the face of a cliff Its bowed front legs form the archway the entrance to

the temple of the ape

CLOUDS OF MIST AND WIND-BLOWN SPRAY SWEEP OVER MA-GOG AND THE MOURNERS ALL
AROUND THEM THE SOUND OF ROARING WATER THE FUNERAL BOAT FLOATS OUT OF THE
TEMPLE AND INTO A ROARING RIVER MA-GOG SWINGS THE CENSER OVER THE WATER -

MA -GOG
(intoning)

In the beginning was the word and the word was the Book of the Lore It
says God created the ape in His own image Alone among His creatures the
ape has a soul One crosses the river now but death is only a door He will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever Amen The mourners beat their chests
with their fists They repeat the word Amen

For a moment the clouds of mist clear Now we see where the boat is headed
- half an ocean of water pours over a sheer drop These are the Falls of No

Return The boat races forward - over the waterfall it goes

The sound of cheering voices very faint drifts towards them Ma-Gog turns
and looks up the river towards the city -

APES HANG FROM THE LADDERS

looking down on Drak and his troops The convoy passes along a road cut
into the side of the ridge Apes have come out of the houses and buildings
to greet them

Will lies in the back of the cart unconscious Faces of apes stare in at
him - theyve never seen anything like it A young ape - a little boy -
stands with his grandfather

KID

What is it

GRANDFATHER
Some sort of human
KID

But look at the eyes Pa - theyre the color of the sea Wheres it from
GRANDFATHER

I dont know - a traveler maybe Nobody knows what lies beyond the Tower
of the Moon

THE WORD TRAVELER IS PICKED UP BY OTHER APES IT RIPPLES THROUGH THE
CROWD A WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WAGON CALLS OUT -

WOMAN

No its not - its a mutant
LABORER

Put it in the zoo

A female ape pushes them aside Shes heavy-set bright eyes an air of
authority about her Over her shoulder she carries a leather satchel with a
series of steel instruments dangling from it Her name is ZORA - she is a
doctor

She and her ASSISTANT - a young male - swing themselves on to the cart
Kneeling beside him Zora puts her hand down and grabs hold of Wills
crotch

ZORA

Whatever it is its male

She rips open Wills shirt - his chest is covered in blood from the gaping
wound

ZORA (CONTD)

Probe

The Assistant hands her a steel instrument She slides it towards the
wound We hold on Wills face - a strangled cry but he doesnt regain
consciousness Zore returns the bloodied probe to her Assistant She calls
out -

ZORA (CONTD)

Drak

The leader of the ape warriors riding close by turns -

ZORA (CONTD)

The animals bleeding to death my Lord

Drak rides up to the wagon

DRAK

I didnt bring him all this way just to have him die

ZORA

(to the assistant)

Ben-Guri - get a vet Quicklyl

AN APE IN A LEATHER APRON

uses a grinding wheel to sharpen a gruesome looking knife This is the VET

Will lies on a stone slab nearby - its a sort of medical centersinks along
the walls racks of equipment hoses to wash down the blood
The Vet cuts the clothing away from Wills wound He turns to Doctor Zora -
VET

Were going to have to give him blood

PRISONER IN A CELL

Hes a tribesman - in his late 40s Despite his tattered furs and hollow
cheeks he carries himself with dignity - hes a proud man His name is
ARAGORN On a chain around his neck he wears a metal ornament like
crescent moon Etched into it are strange markings and the totems of
various tribes

The sound of a key in lock Aragorn turns - the cell door is thrown back
Three ape guards enter Two of them armed with spears drive Aragorn into
a corner The third ape has a leather collar on the end of a pole He drops
it over Aragorns head

Aragorn struggles but the ape jerks the collar tight They drag him from
the cell

TEAM OF HORSES

- their flanks drenched in sweat - walk in a circle They turn a huge wheel
that controls a series of pulleys and winches Attached to the end of a
heavy cable is a wooden platform - a primitive elevator It runs froma
series of impressive house down the side of the ravine to the center of
the city

Standing on the platform are Nazgul and several other elders They look
down on the central square Its crowded with apes - soldiers are being
greeted by their kin

ARAGORN LIES ON HIS BACK

Hes strapped to a slab half-naked in the medical center Theyve put a
gag in his mouth and though he struggles to free himself he can barely

move

Will still unconscious lies on a table next to him Nazgul peers down at
him

NAZGUL

Its human you say

Doctor Zora nods - yes

NAZGUL

Its even uglier than the others

He pulls a covering aside and looks at Wills naked legs

NAZGUL (CONTD)
How can he hunt with legs like those -theyre like twigs Maybe hes
diseased

Everybody shrugs - who knows

The Vet heats a steel needle over an open flame The other end of the
needle is attached to a length of animal intestine It acts as a tube The
Vet grabs Wills forearm and slides the red-hot needle into the vein
Wills body jerks with the pain Nazgul and the others spring back

For a moment Wills wrenched back to consciousness - he sees a light-filled
room a bandage on his chest a bladder full of blood hanging above him
His puts it together the only way he knows - he thinks hes in hospital
WILL

(groggy)

Help me Ive got health insurance Honest

His eyes close as he slips back into darkness Nazgul looks at Doctor Zora
NAZGUL

What is health insurance

DOCTOR ZORA

Some sort of religion

The Vet turns and makes an adjustment to the bladder Another length of
tubing snakes out of it and is attached by a needle to Aragorns arm Its
his blood Now we realize - this is the ape version of a blood transfusion
NAZGUL

Do you think thisI1l work

VET

You can never tell with animals Their bodies arent as sophisticated as an
apes Sometimes their blood fights with each other Either way you know

really quick -they get up and walk around or theyre dead

The Vet turns a little tap - Aragorns blood flows down the tube It hits
Wills vein

WORDS CHISELED INTO STONE
An Ape without knowledge is a fire without light

Euripadape III

It stands over the doorway of a building high on a ridge This is the Hall
of Learning Ma-Gog - his lion skin cloak billowing behind him - hurries up
the steps
THE BLADDER OF BLOOD

is empty Guards are collaring Aragorn preparing to drag him out The door
into the room is thrown open Ma-Gog enters Nazgul and the others greet
him but he barely acknowledges it

MA-GOG

Show him to me

The Vet grabs Wills hair He lifts up his head so that Ma-Gog can see his
face

The high priest takes a step back - theres something about Will that fills
him with loathing Anger flashes in his one good eye He stares at Will
His voice is Iow almost to himself -

MA-GOG (CONTD)

All my life Ive dreaded this day

(turns to the others)

Kill him

DOCTOR ZORA

Weve just spent an hour trying to save him -

MA-GOG

Kill him

He grabs the stand holding the bladder and throws it to the ground Doctor
Zora takes his arm stopping him -

DOCTOR ZORA

The animals unique my lord At least we should look at his brain Maybe
its possible to remove the frontal lobes without killing him Imagine - a
tame human

MA-GOG

Man cant be tamed Alone among Gods primates he kills for lust or greed
He will murder his own brother to possess his brothers land

NAZGUL

The doctors only asking for a chance to experiment The benefits would be
enormous A tame species of human could double food production at last we
could dam the rivers

MA-GOG

You dont know what youre dealing with
NAZGUL
Its just an animal Ma-Gog
MA-GOG
Its not Thats the trouble

A movement on the stone slab They turn and look - Wills eyelids are
fluttering Hes starting to come round itl

He turns to Nazgul In the name of God - summon the Council of Elders
Wills eyes are open now Like through a glass - darkly - he sees the ape
guards coming for him He tries to struggle but hes very weak They haul
him off

HEAVY IRON DOOR

set in a rock wall - on one side a key-hole We tilt up the door to a
narrow set of bars high above it A face straining with effort rises up
to peer through the bars It is Will - looking like death but forcing
himself to do it desperate to see where he is

INSIDE THE CELL

The muscles across his shoulders ripple His one good hand clutches the
bars He hangs by it supporting his weight staring out at a vaulted
underground cavern It looks like a cattle-yard broken down and disused
nowa series of long pens wooden chutes and a primitive conveyor belt

Will cant support himself any longer - he tumbles to the ground He crawls
across the floor and examines the door It fits tight to the rock Theres
no hope of picking the lock - the key-hole doesnt even come all the way
through

Suddenly he stops Nothing for a moment then he hears it again - a
scraping sound

He peers under the wooden bed at the stone blocks that form wall One of
the blocks moves Will grabs hold of it and hauls it into the cell Aragorn
squeezes through from the adjoining cell He looks at Will -

ARAGORN

So you lived then

WILL

What did they do

ARAGORN

They gave you blood

He holds up his bandaged forearm - Will realizes where it came from
WILL
I hope you had a medical

Aragorn looks at him - confused From a distance the sound of horses
whinnying

WILL (CONTD)

What is this place

ARAGORN

It was a slaughterhouse

WILL

For horses

ARAGORN

They use it for stables now No - s different kind of animal For humans

Will stares taken aback Aragorn starts to gather twigs from the corners
of the cell

ARAGORN (CONTD)

In my fathers time the apes rounded up tribes and brought them here
Young apes killed some during their manhood rites the others were made
sport of in the corrals At the end the bodies were thrown onto the belts

and fed to the fire

Aragorn has made a pyramid of twigs and leaves From out of his cloak he
takes two pieces of flint and strikes them A spark starts the fire -

ARAGORN (CONTD)

(softly)

Death is stuck to these walls stranger -sounds not even s thousand winters
can take away Sometimes of s night they speak to me - I can hear the
screams of my people

Will looks at him Firelight plays across their faces

WILL

Why havent they killed you

ARAGORN

They keep me ss bait My name is Aragorn -

He lifts his hand to Will - palm outwards Its some form of greeting Will
returns it
ARAGORN (CONTD)

I am the Ranger of the Easterlings the Leader of the Seven Tribes They
hope the warriors will come and try to free me

WILL

And will they

ARAGORN

Not if they fear my anger I was taken in summer and now winters almost
gone Even the apes grow tired - soon theyll make me walk the Paths of the

Dead

Will looks at Aragorns eyes - theyre fearless The ornament glints on his
chest Will points at it -

WILL

what is it

ARAGORN

Its called the Crescent of Light - its the talisman of my rank
WILL

Silver

ARAGORN

Mithral is how we name it

Will reaches his hand towards it -
WILL

Can I borrow it

Aragorn recoils - this is the most precious thing in the world to him His
hand closes around the insignia -

ARAGORN
Who are you What brings you to the valley of the tribes
WILL

I meant you no harm Im looking for woman one of my own kind Do you know
of people like me

ARAGORN
Never

Will nods his head accepting it Slowly he reaches his hand out -
WILL
If you want to get out of hare I need the talisman Aragorn

The two men look at each other A beat - then Aragorn reaches up and
unfastens it

THE TEMPLE OF THE APE

Torches burn on the walls They cast a glow across the temple - the
underground stream pools of water shelves of rock hewn out of the walls
Several apes crouch on them praying to a golden idol of an ape

Mist rises off of the pools Moving through it we see Nazgul Drak and e
group of old apes The Council of Elders is gathering They pass through a
narrow door -

THE TEMPLES INNER CHAMBER
Oil lamps - hidden in alcoves - illuminate Ma-Gog He stands in front of an
ancient book - strange symbols like Sanskrit run across its pages This

is the Book of the Lore

Ma-Gog looks at the Council of Elders seated in front of himNazgul Drak
and five other huge apes - all leaders in their time

MA-GOG

How many scrolls are there in the Book of the Lore

Nobody replies - the question is so obvious it needs no answer
MA-GOG (CONTD)

One-hundred-and-seventy-six you say -every child knows that
(softly)

But every child is wrong There is one more scroll - the last scroll
sealed with seven seals handed down from high priest to high priest

He slides his hand under the top of the pedestal and releases a hidden
catch The top - the Book still resting on it - tilts up revealing a
secret compartment It is lined with gold leaf Lying in it is a slim folio
of pages -

MA-GOG (CONTD)

It is called the Scroll of Revelation

The Council of Elders stare in awed silence Ma-Gog takes the pages out and
unfastens the seals He reads -

MA-GOG (CONTD)

And it was given unto me to know the wisdom of ages A silence fell and I
saw a new heaven and a new earth Like through a glass darkly I saw the
future

The Council of Elders stare at him He limps forward and stops in front of
them He recites from memory -

MA-GOG (CONTD)

Behold - there rose out of the earth a pale horse and the name of the
horse is Death Those that ride on him are beasts but like no beasts born
before Their limbs are weak but their eyes are as cold as the sea They
are given power over the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and
with fire And let him that hath understanding know the number of these
beasts It is the number of Man

He raises his eyes and looks straight at the Councilors

MA-GOG (CONTD)

Today we saw that beast Mark those words my Lords - their limbs are weak
but they are given power over the earth Now will you listen Kill him
And if we dont Then all hope will fail in this bitter winter

He lays down the secret scroll and closes the secret compartment Nazgul
looks from one to the other of the elders Nobody says a word but he can
read their grim expressions He turns to Drek -

NAZGUL

Kill him Kill him with the sword and with fire Kill himl

THE KEYHOLE TO THE CELL

Its a shining bright image slightly distorted We pull back to reveal
its a reflection Aragorns silver ornament has been polished to a
brilliant luster Its fixed to the end of a length of wood sticking
through the bars high above the iron door

INSIDE THE CELL

The wooden bed has been smashed to pieces

Both Aragorn and Will have used parts of their clothing to harness
themselves so they can see through the bars Aragorn controls the pole with
the mirror on the end of it

By looking into it Will can see the keyhole on the other side of the door
He has a pole with a nail attached to the end of it He turns the pole
guiding the nail towards the keyhole Hes trying to pick the lock

WILL

Do you understand time what time is it

Aragorn looks at the shadows in the slaughterhouse -

ARAGORN
Seven hours since the rising of the sun

WILL

Just after noon

ARAGORN

Shouldnt we wait until night

WILL

(concentrating)

If Im right its gonna be dark a lot sooner than you think

The nail is almost in the key-hole Half an inch to go a quarter It
slides off Will curses and starts again -

THE SUN

beats down from a cloudleu sky Drak and two huge Praetorian Guards - Max
and Hannibal - come through a huge stone portico Its another entrance to
the Temple -one that opertl onto a central square Orak and the two guards
hurry across it towards the slaughterhouu

THE NAIL

at the end of the pole slides into the keyhole Will - barely breathing in
case it breaks his concentration - listens carefully He moves the end of
the pole The nail turns

HUGE SET OF DOORS

are thrown open Daylight spills into the slaughterhouse Drak Max and
Hannibal enter Drak stops - he listens to the horses whinnying and
stomping their hooves -

DRAK

Somethings wrong

(turns to Max)

Get the dogs

HANNIBAL

moves cautiously along the side one of the corrals trying to see whats
wrong with the horses Behind him - a movement in the shadows

Sswhish The sound of something slicing through the air He turns -
Its the side of Aragorns hand It chops hard into the apes throat

shattering his larynx and blasting him into unconsciousness He crumples to
the ground
Aragorn and Will strip him of his weapons Will starts to go but Aragorn
tears a strip off both their shirts He ties the fabric around the apes
ankles

WILL

What are you doing

ARAGORN

Watch - theyre going to bring in the dogs
THE DOGS
arent really dogs at all - theyre a much earlier ancestor We call them
wolves There are two of them on the end of heavy leather leashes Their

handlers have them in Wills cell rubbing parts of the abandoned harnesses
in front of their noses The wolves take the scent

Drak watches as the handlers unfasten the leashes The wolves leap out of
the cell

HANNIBAL

rises groggily to his feet clutching his injured throat He takes a few
steps forward -Grrrr He turns - the two wolves fly towards him He tries
to yell but the only sound he can make is a squeak

He runs - the fabric unseen by him trails from his ankles The wolves
pound after him He glances over his shoulder First one wolf - then the
other - leaps

Fangs and claws glistening they hit him in the back hurling him to the
ground He writhes on to his back One wolf tears at his ankles the other
goes for his throat Rip Blood sprays as the artery breaks

A STONE PASSAGE-WAY

Will and Aragorn are running plunging down in to darkness Arches and
corridors open off of it Its like a labyrinth -

WILL

This doesnt seem like the way out

ARAGORN

Were not going out - not yet

WILL STOPS GRABBING HOLD OF HIM TURNING HIM ROUND -
WILL

So what are we doing

ARAGORN
(softly)

Were going killing

WILL

Killing Dont be stupid -

Will jerks on Aragorns arm starting to haul him back Aragorn throws off
his hand -

ARAGORN

You do what you like But Im the Ranger of the Easterlings -I wont leave
here until its done

From behind them - the sounds of pursuit

WILL

Shit

He starts to run Together they disappear into the gloom ahead

ROW OF CAGE-LIKE CELLS

Will and Aragorn glide past them Theyre taking it slowly very carefully

Now we see why - ahead of them is a set of steel doors Torches on either
side illuminate a guard post but theres no sign of the sentry

Will and Aragorn move closer They pass -
CREVICE IN THE ROCK

We hold on the narrow opening looking deep into the shadows A big ape
heavily armed stands there He has his back to us his legs spread A
trickle of water runs down the rock and drains away - hes taking a piss A
shadow flickers on the wall above him He sees it -THE PASSAGE-WAYMore
shadows -Will and Aragorn are move through the torchlight The steel doors
are straight ahead

The sentry slides out of the crevice - hes behind Will Silently back
pressed again6t the bars of a cell he creeps closer to Will He has a
curved knife in one hand and a short-handled spear in the other Closer
closer

He raises the spear - a rustle of movement Will spins - he sees the spear
about to thrust Hes a dead man

An arm It shoots between the bars of the cell and locks around the
sentrys throat half choking him

Will leaps forward and drives the butt of a weapon into the sentrys jaw
The sentry crumples to the ground revealing the face of the prisoner Its
not a man though -its an ape Hes in his prime - barrel chested and a
fine head His name is STRIDER
He and Will look at each other through the bars
STRIDER

Two rules in life - never play cards with anyone called Doc and never
whatever else you do turn your back on an ape

Will stares at him Strider grins Will smiles back -
WILL

Thanks Ill remember that

He starts to search the sentry

ARAGORN

What are you doing

WILL

Looking for the keys

ARAGORN

No

WILL

He saved our lives

ARAGORN

Hes an ape

Will shrugs himself free of Aragorns hand -

WILL

You go and kill as many apes as you like - Im setting this one free
Aragorn looks at him A beat

ARAGORN

(softly)

Its not apes Im going to kill

A PRISON LABORATORY

The heavy steel doors stand open Inside is a clean and gruesome room -

sinks and instruments along a wall a series of operating tables and a row
of cages
Behind the bars are six tribes-people - men women and a little boy All of
them carry surgical scars on their heads Its made two of them blind the
others stare blankly into space

Aragorn moves down the cages Several of them shuffle towards him but
theres no recognition - theyre like the walking dead Aragorn doesnt say
a word Grim-faced he loads the crossbow and starts to fire killing them
Will and Strider come through the doorway - they see Aragorn going from
cage to cage Will steps forward going to stop him Striders hand grabs
his shoulder restraining him

STRIDER

Leave it He knows what hes doing

Will turns and looks at him questioning

STRIDER (CONTD)

The doctors operate on them - up here

(taps his head)

The tribes think that we steal their souls

(he pauses - softly)

Maybe theyre right

Aragorn reaches the last cage A woman - in her 20s - stands in the middle
of the cell looking at him Aragorn stares at her face His lip trembles
with emotion She tilts her head on one side as if trying to work
something out Tears fill Aragorns eyes She stumbles a step forward The
Ranger closes his eyes He pulls the trigger A crossbow bolt slams into
her chest and she falls

Will leans against the doorway unwilling to watch staring down the
passageway He turns at a footfall - Aragorn rejoins them His voice is
hollow as if something has died within him -

ARAGORN

Its done We can go now

He turns and leads them back down the passageway

THE WOLVES

Theres five of them now hunting through the slaughter-house in a pack
All around them we see the torches of the apes as they search the nooks and

crannies The horses whinny wildly as they catch the scent of the wolves

Will Aragorn and Strider are crouched in a corner of the corral smearing
their bodies with horse manure

STRIDER
The fresher the better Cover everything -thats the only way youll hide
your scent

The wolves sniff the air coming closer Will staring through the rungs of
the coral sees their gleaming eyes coming closer He raises his crossbow
getting ready

The wolves stop They raise their heads and look - the whole cavern is
growing dark A giant shadow falls across the doorway into the outside
world

The horses rear and buck The apes are staring - darkness is falling in the
middle of the day The wolves hackles rise in fear They howl

Aragorn and Strider are cowering back

ARAGORN

What is it

WILL

Come on Now

He drags them forward and grabs hold of one of the horses

AN UNEARTHLY LIGHT

has fallen on the city The apes are in confusion - soldiers and workers
are running children are screaming A horse has thrown its rider and is

bolting down the terraces

The darkness grows ever deeper In the sky the face of the moon
obliterates the sun - its a full solar eclipse

Two horses flying at a gallop charge through the doors of the
slaughterhouse Will is on one Aragorn clinging to his back Strider is on
the other They wheel across an open space through running apes and speed
down a terrace

MA-GOG

steps out on to a rock ledge He holds a staff in one hand his cloak
thrown back over his shoulder magnificent in the eerie light He stares
down at the chaos Drak swings across a ladder and lands at his side -
DRAK

What is it

MA-GOG

(wild)

A sign - the hand of Man passes across the face of God Lookl He points to
a terrace below - Will leads the other two escapees along a road and on to
the iron bridge Drak and Ma-Gog stare at them Darkness engulfs them
Out of the blackness an image -
CHRIST ON THE CROSS

Its a stained-glass window in a huge cathedral A priest is at the altar
conducting Mass for the repose of the dead We pull back to reveal a tiny
white coffin - just big enough for a baby Next to it is another coffin
And another - a row of them

PRIEST

And even now as sorrow has no end we find comfort in the words of the Lord
Jesus Christ Did he not say unto Mark -suffer the little children to come
unto me for they are the Kingdom of Heaven Now and forever Amen

The congregation - sad-eyed relatives and weeping parents - fill the pews
CONGREGATION
Amen

Pall-bearers lift up the tiny coffins The organ starts to play A soloist
- a tenor -steps to the side of the altar He starts to sing the Latin hymn
Penis Angelicas The haunting words of the hymn fill the cathedral They
carry over to -

THE SPACE DOME

is lit up by banks of lights that turn night into day The clock tower
above the biology building shows the time200am Even so the area bustles
with activity

INSIDE THE DOME

An illuminated chart dominates one wall - just like the strategy map in the
Pentagons war room Every research center is identified - next to it is
its function and a list of personnel We see Princeton Stanford Texas
AandM Los Alamos Tentacles reach out to Oxford the Pasteur Institute the
University of Beijing

Below the chart are nitrogen-cooled Cray super-computers We track through
teams of men and women processing data satellite dishes feeding a
communications network a video conference taking place in a corner
technicians routing and re-routing phone calls and faxes

We come to a glass wall On the other side is Diamond -

A SMALL OFFICE

Glass doors seal out the electronic hum Diamond staring through the
glass looks exhausted DeMaupassent sits on a couch Hes in his
shirt-sleeves dark rings under his eyes Next to him is Bob the young

neurologist He wears jeans and a t-shirt On the front it says

Ill sleep when Im dead
The coffee table is piled with files journal extracts and computer
print-outs A video projector beams a complex molecular structure on to a
screen

Diamond rubs her eyes trying to wipe away the fatigue

DIAMOND

Im sorry Luc - say that again

DEMAUPASSANT

DEMAUPASSANT (CONTD)

(kindly)

My fault Billie - I rattle on too much The result is - weve fixed the
time frame

He hits the projector - the image of a fetus developing normally in the
womb appears on the screen deMAUPASSANT

The fetus develops normally through the first trimester Then it happens -
about sixteen weeks and two days everything falls apart The whole

chemical structure goes out of control -

He flashes up another image - a fetus that is already aging remarkably
deMAUPASSANT

Once it starts its irreversible If were going to stop it weve got to
intercede here -

He points at the slide of the normally developing fetus

BOB

(taking over)

Theres a trigger - some major fucking switch gets turned Thats what Ive
been working on Its definitely in the mDNA Theres a fragment of one

chromosome Im looking at -

He flicks a switch on the video projector A slide of a human gene
massively magnified popl on to the screen

BOB (CONTD)

Its so different I call it the alien How it got there exactly what it
does - I havent got the first idea no fucking idea at all

Diamond looks at his grim face He seems totally defeated
DIAMOND

(quietly)
Is it that bad

He stares at the floor Theres not even a hint of the former arrogance
BOB

Someones dropped us in the middle of the Louvre Were blind men and
theyve told us to find the Mona Lisa Theres four miles of galleries end
weve got five minutes to do it Thats how I feel -and thats when rm
optimistic

Diamond turns to deMaupassant

DIAMOND

Luc

DEMAUPASSANT

Im sixty-two years old Ive seen us go from DC3s to landing on the moon
In my life Ive won all the glittering prizes Ive always believed nothing
was beyond the reach of Man but Ill tell you honestly - this may never be

unraveled If it is it wont be in my lifetime

He looks at them Silence Theres nothing anyone can say He starts to
gather up his papers-

DEMAUPASSANT (CONTD)
So what do we do I think its like Gatsby -so we beat on boats against
the current borne back ceaselessly into the past Theres no other way

ia there

They nod their hoods - you have to try DeMaupaasant and Bob start to
leave

DIAMOND

Luc

(he turns) )

Youre certain - about the time I mean
DEMAUPASSANT

(Nodding)

Sixteen weeks How far along are you

DIAMOND

Twelve weeks

They look at one another The old man speaks gently -

DEMAUPASSANT
Good night Billie
A TINY FETUS

perfectly formed - floats in the amniotic fluid Its alive - the large
head sways the heart beats through the translucent ribs

Diamond has her shirt pulled up and her jeans down around her thighs She
lies on a stainless steel table in a hi-tach examination room A complex
array of equipment -ultra-sounds and scanners - beams down on her exposed
stomach It projects a video image onto a screen

She is alone in the room manipulating the equipment herself She stares up
at the child growing in her womb We see the genitalia

DIAMOND

So - youre a little boy Its funny - I think I knew

She reaches up and gently touches the image of his face

DIAMOND (CONTD)

Weve got four weeks The way I see it -theres nothing to lose I cant
tell you whetIl happen to us Its on the edge mister The airs so thin
out there we may not even be able to breathe But what the hell - its a
chance

She takes her hand away and looks at his face

DIAMOND (CONTD)

You want to try it Sure you do Youre my son Weve waited all our lives
for each other

A STACK OF HAND-WRITTEN NOTEPADS

lie on a table in the basement We track through them - past computer
print-outs and dog-eared journals We recognize them - these are Wills
detailed notes

To the table is the makeshift lab - racks of bottles and syringes In the
dim light we see Diamond She removes the catheter from her vein turns and
climbs up the flotation tank

INSIDE THE TANK

Water sloshes back and forth Diamond lowers herself in and floats there
For a moment she stares up at the circle of light spilling through the
hatch We hold on her face

DIAMOND (CONTD)

(softly)

So we beat on boats against the current
She reaches up and pulls the hatch shut Clang Darkness
THE SUN AND THE MOON

Its one of those strange twilights when both celestial bodies hang in the
sky together Smoke drifts across them We tilt down to ape city -

A column of smoke and flame spirals out of a stone chimney on top of the
slaughterhouse

RED HOT FIRE

burns in a huge furnace at one end of the slaughterhouse The rickety
conveyor belt is working clattering away Several ape workers throw the
bodies of the lab animals - the dead tribes-people - on to the belt

The body of the young boy is carried forward on the belt It dumps him into
the furnace The flames engulf him

WILLS EMPTY CELL

The door hangs open The space is lit by a dozen torches Drak is alone
moving around the cell trying to work out how Will escaped He looks at
the smashed bed the hole in the wall the torn clothing that made the
harness

He swings the heavy door on its hinges and touches the lock No answers
there Lying in the doorway is the length of wood with the nail in the end
Drak picks it up He turns it over in his hand thnking about it

He jumps One handed he catches hold of the bars above the door
Effortlessly he hauls himself up and pokes the wood through the bars The
nail touches the lock

DRAK
(to himself)
Clever you clever fucking animal

DOCTOR ZORA (0S)

My lord

He turns and sees the doctor hurrying towards him
DOCTOR ZORA (CONTD)

(urgent)

Could I see you please

THE HALL OF POWER

is a magnificent room - stone columns and towering trees growing in huge
pots At one end is a rock shelf - open to the gathering twilight
Silhouetted against it commanding a view of the entire city is the
Council of Elders They sit around a table made from bone and tusks deep
in discussion

Nazgul looks up - he sees Drak approaching through the shadows

NAZGUL

Drak I was just saying - maybe its a blessing

DRAK

A blessing

NAZGUL

Where theres one there must be others If wed killed him we might never
find them

MA-GOG

But the animals not stupid - he knows come day-break well be tracking
him Whos to say hell run for home

Drak stops in front of them
DRAK

No - hes not stupid But even dogs hunt in packs of seven Every animal
needs its kind And when we find them - what then

MA-GOG

What do you think

DRAK

Just like the tribes - burn them out of their holes put them to the sword
I dont mind doing that - I like it - but its never enough is it No
matter how many we kill every year theyre still here Why will it be any
different with the Blue Eyes What we need is a final solution

NAZGUL And where do we find that

DRAK (CONTD)

Doctor Zoras brought back patients from a place called Kismatu Ive been
talking to her about it -

Several of the Council are looking at each other - perplexed
MA-GOG
What is Kismatu

NAZGUL
Its a tiny colony farther out than even the northern frontier Females and
babies have been dying there

He turns to Drak - his eyes intense very interested

NAZGUL (CONTD)

Go on

COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

There are iron barn on I series of high windows but in the middle of the
room is a jungle-gym Underneath it are ape toys Five baby apes sit on
cots They must be no more than two or three years old but their faces end
bodies are those of old old apeswizened and wrinkled frail with age

A double set of bars provide a sort of air-lock Hanging on them is a sign

Quarantine No Entry

Drak and the Council of Elders stare in at the children Doctor Zora is
with them - shes nervous twisting her fingers

DOCTOR ZORA

We dont know what causes it- a virus probably Id hoped to complete our
research before I came to you with my proposal But given the
circumstances -

NAZGUL I

Its a brilliant idea

(turns and smiles at her)

Brilliant

HORSES HOOVES

paw the ground Theyre bound with cloth to stop them leaving a trail Its
night -the horses are tethered near a fire burning in the lee of a rock

Will and Strider have made camp - a hare roasts over the fire Aragorn sits
well apart - a silhouette in the moonlight - staring out into the forest
lost in his thoughts Will and Strider look at him

STRIDER

Hes their leader - he can never take his eye from the mountain He has to
do what he thinks is right

WILL
(hard)

By killing them
STRIDER

Dont judge him Will I couldnt have done it I wonder if you could One
of those women he just killed wes his daughter

Will reacts He turns and stares at the silhouette A long beat
WILL

(quietly)

We call it a Iobotomy What other things have you people tried

He turns to face him Strider shrugs Theres something about it -
something almost evasive

WILL (CONTD)

Fuck you Strider Tell me

He stares at Will - hes never seen him angry
STRIDER

dont know if its true my sisters mate works in the lab He says
Doctor Zoras working on some disease -

Will comes towards him -

WILL

What sort of disease

STRIDER

Of the children I think - ape children
WILL

How did they die Strider Old in the belly -is that how
STRIDER

Some of them You know this disease

Will stares at him taking it in

WILL

(softly)

So thats how it happened Fuck you people
STRIDER

They havent done it yet It may not work
WILL
They will and it does

He turns end takes step towards the forest He runs his fingers through his
hair -WILL God help us

STRIDER
Thats funny - thats exactly what an ape would say

Will turns He and Strider stare at one another - the ape and the man both
struck by the sudden commonality

STRIDER (CONTD)

Im sorry

Will walks slowly back to the fire Strider starts to strip the meat off a
hare hes roasting over the flames He offers it to Will He shakes his
head - hes not hungry anymore He stares into the flames -

WILL

What about you Strider - why were you in the cell

STRIDER

I fought another ape Nothing very heroic Im afraid - I was drunk He
fell badly his head hit the branch of a tree going down It broke his
neck

He pauses Were not like humans An ape never kills one of his own Never
WILL

Whats the punishment

STRIDER

At the ceremony of summer rites the high priest would curse me with death
I would have been left to die in the forest -no journey over the waterfall
no-one to say the sacred words Without that no ape can walk in the next
world You saved my life Will and Im grateful But theres nothing I can

do about my soul Im a dead ape walking

Strider stripe more meet off the hare Will picks up a saddle and blanket
and starts to make himself bed

STRIDER (CONTD)

You knew didnt you You knew the sun was going to swallow the moon
Thats why you werent afraid

Will pauses - then he turns to him
WILL

Yes - I knew

STRIDER

WHO ARE YOU WILL

WILL

Ive come a long way Strider - its farther then I can explain
STRIDER

Ive heard stories - old apes tell them round the fire late at night - of
strange lands where the creatures can tell the future Is that where youre
from

WILL

In a way yeah its something like that

STRIDER

So what happens to it afl to the world weve built Tell me that
WILL

It passes away

Strider stares at him through the firelight

STRIDER

History remembers though - its passed on what we did I mean
WILL

No Strider - theres nothing not a trace left behind

Strider thinks for a moment then he smiles gently

STRIDER

So its just vanity then - what we believe that the works of the ape will
last forever

WILL

Yes its vanity But not just of apes Strider -maybe of men too

He turns and settles down on his makeshift bed Strider - the food
forgotten - stares out into the night A million stars hang on a velvet

sky

Look down from them - in the vast blackness of the forest one tiny
lightthe flickering fire
DUST SWIRLING HOOVES POUNDING
battalions of ape cavalry sweep out of the stables Dawn is breaking across
the city Ma-Gog stands on a ridge his staff raised blessing the army as

it rides out

At its head is Drak He clatters across the iron and wood bridge and down
the avenue of idols Votive fires burn in front of every statue

A RAINBOW

arches across the end of a tiny gorge Dozens of streams cascade into
pools spilling over ledges and swirling into ponds Aragorn leads Will and
Strider along a hidden path - a rock ledge that runs behind the

waterfalls

The ledge widens into a large cave Sunlight streams through a veil of
cascading water Aragorn looks around - somethings worrying him

ARAGORN

This is the Rainbow Tribes cave They should be here

A STONE FIREPLACE

Aragorn places his hand on the circle of stones feeling its warmth
ARAGORN (CONTD)

They left at the rising of the sun

He moves deeper into the cave - a maze of limestone caverns and
passage-ways He stops at sleeping area - weapons lie there food in
baskets

ARAGORN

(softly)

Why such hurry

Suddenly he stops listening He looks at Strider -

ARAGORN (CONTD)

You heard it

Strider nods his head - yes Will hasnt heard a thing He listens hard -
nothing

ARAGORN (CONTD)
Animal

STRIDER
I dont think so

Strider moves silently to the side of the cave He picks up a crossbow
STRIDER (CONTD)

Is there another entrance

ARAGORN

From the ridge above Apes

STRIDER

Scouts probably

He cocks the crossbow Aragorn has picks up a bow and spear He moves
towards a cavern signaling Strider to take a passageway

Will grabs a crossbow Strider tosses him a chain mail vest - armor They
move off

HONEYCOMB OF PASSAGES

eep in the cave A sound - pebbles falling off a ledge Then we see a
flicker of light - a torch is moving through a cavern Whoever holds it
turns a corner and is lost in darkness

A CROSSROADS

of arches and stalactites Will and Strider split apart Will moves
silently through the darkness into a cavern Through an archway he sees a
shadow on the wall He goes fast towards it -

A HUGE BOULDER

The shadow comes round the boulder We tilt down and now we see whos
holding the torchDiamondl Shes armed with a crossbow - cocked end loaded
She turns a corner -

Ten feet in front of her is Strider She stares at the massive apes back -
bandoleer of arrows slung over his shoulder Her eyes widen with fear
She raises the crossbow -

o

Strider hears it He spins weapon rising -

turns into a passage midway between them He sees Diamond about to fire He
screams -

Too late - she pulls the trigger Will hurls himself forward - in front of
Strider Whack The arrow blasts into his chest He crashes to the ground

Diamond stares down at him
DIAMOND

Will
His eyes open - hes gasping for breath from the impact He and Diamond
look at one another Strider reaches down and rips the arrow out of Wills
chain mail armor Diamonds shoulders sag with relief

DIAMOND (CONTD)

(indicates Strider Whos he

WILL

Ill explain later

He struggles to his feet and looks at Diamond -

WILL (CONTD)

What made you come I thought the mDNA was just a theory One of dozens of
theories - isnt that what you said

DIAMOND

We did a lot of work I guess I was wrong
WILL

People have been wrong about a lot of things
THE GREAT VALLEY

stretches out below - primordial forests and cascading streams Will and
Diamond stand on a rock ledge outside the cave

WILL (CONTD)

This is the rift valley in Kenya -

He points at the towering snow-capped peak

WILL (CONTD)

Thats Kilamanjaro - ten thousand feet higher but a hundred thousand years
of wind and rain will turn it into the mountain we know Think of it -
weve come back a hundred thousand years Everyone told me it couldnt be
done but weve crossed the frontier now - Man has traveled through space
and time How long has science dreamed of that

DIAMOND

How long have you

WILL

All my life

DIAMOND
Dream no more Youve done it Like you said in your note - it was Doctor
Robert Plant of UC Berkeley

WILL turns and looks out at the valley -

WILL

(softly)

Yeah - I really have havent I

Diamond watches him Theres a shout from inside the cave -
STRIDER (0S)

Aragorn - Ive found it

A CAVE PAINTING

Newly-drawn is hidden in e nook high up in the main cave Strider Will
and Diamond watch aa Aregorn looks at it by torchlight

ARAGORN

I thought they would leave word for their hunters Kip-Kena has called a
gathering of the Seven Tribes

WILL

Where

ARAGORN

Two days travel - at the Eagles Nest

He looks out through the mouth of the cave - twilight is closing in
ARAGORN (CONTD)

Well stay hera tonight Be ready to leave at first light

THE EMBERS OF A FIRE

burn in the circle of stones Aragorn and Strider are sleeping next to it

Will and Diamond have been awake all night They sit in the shadows near
the entrance to the cave speaking quietly

DIAMOND

An ape civilization You said there was a city what happened to it all
WILL

You know what weve found of Aragorns whole race Seventeen bones thats

all Anthropologists have discovered evidence of the apes - we call them
skulls Bones last a lot longer than civilizations
DIAMOND

I guess theres a lesson in that

WILL

Listen Billie - the apes have discovered a disease

Diamond reacts Will crouches down - in the dirt he scratches out a small
chain of circles Its a molecule

WILL (CONTD)

Its really rare and lucky for them its in an isolated area Theyre not
stupid - they understand its potential They plan to give it to the tribes

He draws an arrow from the molecule to a bow-legged stick figure of a man
WILL (CONTD)

And maybe they do but it doesnt matter -Aragorns people arent us
Already evolutions taken another track -

scratches a cross through the bow-legged man He draws the figure of an
upright human

WILL (CONTD)

Somewhere in the rift valley is someone like us - the first man
DIAMOND

Woman You said it was in the mitochondrial DNA - it has to be a woman
She reaches forward and scratches long hair on to the figures head
WILL

Youre right Sooner or later the apes find her She doesnt look like the
tribes but the apes dont care - shes human

So they give her the disease Shes different though - it doesnt work or
at least it doesnt seem to It gets integrated into her Its passed on
it mutates it weaves its way into the mDNA It lies there - a bomb waiting
to go off And then one day -

DIAMOND

After a hundred thousand years

WILL

The planets five billion years old Whats that to Nature A blink of the
eye

Will throws the stick down on the ground
WILL (CONTD)

Thats the theory anyway
DIAMOND

(impressed)

A helluva theory Doctor Plant
HE TURNS AND LOOKS IT HER -
DIAMOND (CONTD)

Theres not much time Will We have to find her before the apes and we
have to do it within four weeks

WILL

Jesus Billie Four weeks Weve got a theory - thats all We dont even
know half the problems were dealing with You cant put a deadline on
science

DIAMOND

Science Will What about people Isnt that what this is all about Im
sorry - I thought there were children dying

WILL

Sure Of course its about that too

DIAMOND

But then you dont care muchabout people do you

THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER A BEAT WILLS VOICE IS HARD -
WILL

No - I guess I dont Not for a long time Ideas and knowledge are what
matter Theyre the shining ideals Thats the only way we progress

DIAMOND

Progress to what Were both children of our age arent we Weve grown up
to believe the more we know the more advanced we are But what does that
mean if weve forgotten the things of real value You know the reason I
came Its got nothing to do with science or knowledge Im going to have a
child -thats why Im here

They look at one another
DIAMOND (CONTD)

Uke you said the womens out there somewhere Why ere we traveling with
them
(indicates Aragore and Strider)
We should cut ourselves loose
WILL

We wouldnt last a day Weve got to keep moving Billie The apes are like
storm-troopers

DIAMOND
Where are they now
WILL

Right behind I think Strider has some sort of tribal intuition He says he
can hear their hoof beats in his head

The first rays of dawn pierce the mist from the waterfall Will and Diamond
turn at a sound behind them - Aragorn is getting up

ARAGORN

Ready

A SPARKLING RIVER

winds through a beautiful valley The two horses splash along the waters
edge Strider and Aragorn are mounted on one Will and Diamond on the
other They turn a curve - Aragorn leads them out of the shallows and into
the forest

THE CAVE OF THE RAINBOW

Ape soldiers are swarming over the cave A TRACKER uses torchlight to study
footprints He looks up at Orak -

TRACKER

Theres four of them my Lord

DRAK

Four The Tracker points It a at of prints -
TRACKER

Its woman Blue Eyes has a mate

DRAK

Excellent I look forward to meeting her

SOLDIER (0S)
My Lord - hoof prints

Drak turns - the man stands on a path that curves up towards the roof of
the cave Drak looks up - high above he sees a slash of daylight Its
another entrance

DRAK

Malakai Bolag

Two heavily-armed officers emerge from among the soldiers With Drak they
run for the wall They leap up the rock face - their massive hands grabbing
tiny ledges

Other apes follow them They scramble up the wall with amazing speed

AN EAGLE CIRCLES

Soaring and hovering in the sky We tilt down a tribesman - dressed in
skins edged with feathers - is perched high on a jagged peak Hes a
LOOKOUT He tenses —-

Four figures on foot appear on a path cut into the side of a cliff The
Lookout gives a piercing crythe sound of an eagle It carries down to -

SERIES OF WOODEN PLATFORMS
are built into the rocky crags opening into caves They are connected by
ladders and bridges slung across dizzying drops The inhabitants here live

with their totem -this is the nest of the Tribe of the Eagle

The platforms and caves are crowded with the gathering tribes People turn
at the Lookouts cry A man pushes through listening - its Kip-Kena

THE LOOKOUT POST

Kip follows the direction of the Lookouts pointing finger Will and
Diamond lead the other two - all on foot now - along the path

KIP
Its the traveler With a woman

The Lookout shields his eyes against the sun - the visitors ere coming
closer

LOOKOUT

The fool - hes brought an ape with himl He reaches for a bow but Kips
hand falls on his arm stopping him

KIP

Whos the other one though

(realizing)
Aragorn

He turns yelling down to the platforms -
KIP (CONTD)

Its the Ranger The Ranger is free

ON THE PLATFORMS

The tribes-people burst into action - running for the bridges scaling the
ladders

A WOODEN BRIDGE SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR

Whack It locks into place on the far side of a deep crevasse Its a
primitive drawbridge Aragorn steps on to it leading the others across

The tribes-people are gathering eager to greet him Then they see Strider
A ripple of fear and anger runs through them

ARAGORN

The ape travels with me - treat him as a friend

Nobody argues with the Ranger He stops in front of Kip The young warrior
starts to bow his head but Aragorn stops him He puts out his arms - they
embrace

Will crosses the bridge Kip sees him He grasps Wills arm in greeting -
KIP

You carry part of my spirit with you -I owe you my life Welcome Traveler
INSIDE THE EAGLES NEST

A series of caves connected by vaulted arches extend in to the mountain
Theyre crowded with members of various tribes - children are playing

flint-knappers are fashioning tools women ara cooking

A shaft of sunlight strikes a ledge high up the wall Kip and Will have
found a quiet place amid the bustle

WILL
Are the seven tribes here
KIP

All except the Antelope They hunt the plains far to the west - they have
the longest journey

WILL

Will they come
KIP

Who knows - maybe the apes have found them Nobody has seen them for many
summers gone Why

WILL

Im searching for someone - a young woman She looks like us
(he indicates Diamond) )

I thought she might live with the tribes

KIP

Is she a relative - was she born to your hearth

WILL

To all of our hearths My race reveres her We think of her as the first
woman Without her our lives are nothing

KIP
(nodding his head)

Women are of the spirit - we believe that too Mother Earth mates with the
totems Only through woman can their children walk the world

WILL

Have you seen her

KIP

NO

WILL

Youre sure Perhaps some of the women have seen something

KIP

She looks like you you say No offense Traveler but the women say youre
the ugliest man theyve ever seen A woman that looks like you - Im sure
they would have talked about it

WILL

Ugly

They smile at one another

KIP

Im sorry I cant help
A torch flares below Kip looks down into an adjoining cave Its empty
except for a group of men - all warriors - filing in These are the leaders
of each of the tribes

ANOTHER TORCH IS LIT

They ring the walls of the small cave By their light we see the skins the
feathers and the symbols of each tribes totem - the eagle the tiger the
rainbow

Beneath each one squats its leader One place is empty - the Tribe of the
Antelope Will sits near the entrance He watches Aragorn - dressed in
ceremonial robes the Crescent of Light glistening at his neck - rise to
his feet

ARAGORN

Weve traveled without rest - there are soldiers a day behind The ape says
its an army

KIP

And there are more coming from the north Five squadrons et least the
runners say Its led by the old warrior Nazgul

ARAGORN

Is that why you called the gathering
KIP

Great things are moving Ranger -

An old man battle-scarred and gray leans forward He is the leader of the
Rainbow

A RAINBOW

A stranger walks out of the west the moon hides the sun armies are on the
march - come the new moon nothing in Middle Earth will be the same

Others nod their heads in agreement

KIP (CONTD)

We either fight or flee - the Tribes must decide

ARAGORN

I know you Kip - you always were a fighter What do the others say
warrior in a feathered cloak speaks -

EAGLE

It doesnt matter what we say - the Ranger has returned Well follow
wherever he leads
Aragorn looks at their faces Slowly he shakes his head -

ARAGORN

Ill walk the path Mother Earth has laid for me but Ill walk it no more
as Ranger

The leaders stare at him Several start to object but he silences them with
his hand -

ARAGORN

A man leads from his heart and winter has come early to mine

(softly)

I took the life of my daughter - and some of your kinfolk with it I did my
duty -nothing more can be asked of I men But now others must walk in my

place

He walks forward unfastening the Crescent of Light He stops in front of
Kip -

ARAGORN

If I should have had a son I would have hoped for a man as fine as you
This is my last act as Ranger of the Easterlings-

He reaches out and slips the Crescent of Light around Kips neck

ARAGORN (CONTD)

Take care of my fathers people Guide them well

(he looks at the leaders)

You must decide what is best for the Tribes For me I was the one that
had to strike the blow but it was the apes who killed my child Tomorrow I

will go to fight them What father could do any less

He turns away and walks towards the entrance Only Will sees the tears in
his eyes

KIDS FACES WIDE-EYED

They huddle together - staring at the strange-looking woman and the ape
Strider is building a small fire at the side of the cave Diamond lays down
furs for sleeping She looks up - the leaders are coming out of the
meeting Will approaches

WILL

Theyre going to war They leave at dawn

STRIDER
Theyll be slaughtered
WILL

They think if they leave the valley their totems wont follow Without
them they say theyre dead anyway

DIAMOND

We should go now

Will looks at her She meets his gaze Suddenly she realizes -
DIAMOND

Oh nol Were not fighting someone elses war -

WILL

Listen to me -

DIAMOND

Weve got four weeks Willl Four weeks to find her Shes not here so whet
are we waiting for Lets go

The tribes-people turn at the raised voices Will takes Diamonds arm and
guides her to a private corner -

WILL

Listen Billie We know the future - but if we beat the apes they cant
harm the woman

DIAMOND

Beat the apes And say we dont - or say one of us gets captured What
then Dont you understand Four weeksi

WILL

Yeah I understand - but those things arent going to happen We know
things the apes cant even dream of This is our world Billie - men won it
with their minds All we need is knowledge and science Weve got them
both We can win

DIAMOND

What are we going to do - dazzle them with calculus This is an army Will
- you said it yourself Storm-trooperst

WILL
Look -

He bends and picks up s rock from the ground He hands it to Diamond -
WILL (CONTD)

Taste it Thats saltpeter - the natural form of potassium nitrate The
caves are littered with the stuff Youve smelt the air - theres sulfur
all around If we burn timber thatIl give us charcoal Youre s scientist
- you know what it means

Sure - she knows what it means She stares at him

DIAMOND

Its strange isnt it Give s man s problem and the first thing he thinks
about is weapons

WILL

Were a frail species Billea Its only weapons that have made us bigger
than we are

DIAMOND
Or smaller
WILL

Its the apes who are going to be a whole lot smaller after this We can
beat themi No more experiments - no more problem

DIAMOND

(quietly)

I hope your right Will

FIRES BURN

all over the eagles nest turning piles of timber into charcoal The camp
is a hive of activitycolumns of tribes-people make their way up from the
valley carrying piles of sulfur rock women and children sit in circles
pounding the saltpeter into dust Will moves among the tribal leaders
watching as they measure and combine the elements in bowls

Strider sits apart watching not sure if the humans have lost their minds
STRAW MAN FLIES TOWARDS US
He looks like a scarecrow except hes dressed in captured ape armor Rigged
to a flying fox he speeds past a rock face All of the tribes-people are
gathered on the side of a crevasse watching
The straw men flies closer - towards a rocky outcrop Will touches a

burning ember to the ground We see a flash of flame as a fuse ignites but
we lose it among the rocks A thin trail of smoke marks its passage

The tribes-people watch - nothing seems to be happening Suddenly - just as
the straw man reaches the outcrop -
Ka-boom A huge explosion Fire and flying rock hit the straw men

The tribes-people scream Terrified they turn and run Smoke and dust
obscure the flying fox Will walks forward to examine his handiwork

Tribes-people peer out from their hiding places - the smoke and dust clear
They see the tattered shreds of the straw man hanging from the rope

Several of the women start to cry in fear

Will stands on the edge of the crevasse He turns - Kip Aragorn and the
other leaders are approaching They look at him with trepidation

KIP

You make fire from rocks of the earth -what is this thing
WILL

Gunpowder

Kip turns to the others They repeat the word as if that will unlock its
mystery

WILL (CONTD)

Weve still got work to do

He turns and goes The tribes-people emboldened by their leaders come
closer They draw back from Will as he makes his way through them He comes
face to face with Strider The man and the ape look at one another

STRIDER

Apes believe men are the devils children Maybe theyre right What have
you done Will - what have you unleashed on the world

WILL
Nothing Strider The future thats all
STRIDER

I cant fight with you tomorrow Will To kill an ape in a brawl is one
thing but I cant go to war against my people

WILL

(kindly)

I never expected you to

Again they look at one another Will turns and leaves
WATER FLYING HOOVES POUNDING

Drak and his cavalry pennants flying gallop along the edge of a river
Ranks of infantry followed by horse-drawn supply wagons travel behind
The river swings around a point thick with trees We crane up above the
foliage - a tributary flows clown the other side Marching through the
shallows is another army of apes At their head on a stallion is Nazgul

The two squadrons converge at the end of the point The foot soldiers meld
together the Praetorian Guard splash ahead Drak and Nazgul ride side by
side Ahead the river and its tributary pour over a broad rock ledge Its
a natural weir -

THE FORD OF THE THREE RIVERS

A jumble of logs and broken branches lie snagged in the middle of the
river The Praetorian Guard sweep past them and turn on to the weir

The Guard spur their horses forward forcing them through the fast-running
current crossing to the other side -

IN THE TREES

A shadow of movement Tribesmen glide through the dappled light of the
forest almost invisible in skins and camouflage

Will and Kip stand motionless deep in shadow They watch as the Guard on
their horses come thundering across the ford straight towards them The
infantry are close behind Will drops his hand -

TRAILS OF FIRE

whip along the ground - out of the forest and on to the flattened rocks
that form part of the ford The Guards horses shy away The apes look down
in puzzlement -

Boom Boom Booml Sections of the weir explode in plumes of rock and water
Apes are cut to pieces horses are hurled into the fast-flowing water

On the far side - Oraks horse rears up He drives his spurs into its
flanks trying to control it Clouds of dust and smoke billow across the
weir the wounded are screaming - the ape cavalry wheel and turn in

confusion

Drak plunges forward - chaos all around him He pounds his chest with both
fists and roars -

DRAK
Apes - chargel

The apes still on their horses hear his cry They spur their mounts
forward The first of the cavalry reach -

THE SHORE
Boom boom More explosions rip the river bank to pieces

IN THE FOREST
Batteries of cross-bows are mounted on a series of long wooden frames The
Eagle leader and his warriors run from one to the other touching flames to
rope fuses Fire sizzles towards the crossbows each one loaded with a
charge -

Bambambamf The scores of crossbows fire

ON THE FORD

The ape cavalry are plunging through the smoke and debris Wham The hail
of arrows cut them to pieces

Drak is in the middle of a whirling mass of apes and horses He looks
through the smoke - into the forest He sees Will standing on a rock with
Kip like a general commanding his army

Drak bellows with rage He snaps the reins about to drive his horse
onward An arrow flies in from the flank Whackt It slams into Draks chest
armor splintering He turns -

THE JUMBLE OF LOGS

floats in the middle of the river The leader of the Rainbow Tribe water
streaming off of him kneels on the tangle of trees and branches reloading
his bow This is no jumble of logs - its a firing platform theyve
anchored therel

dozen Rainbow warriors hidden in the water clamber out of the river They
kneel next to their leader drlwing their bows -

THE FORD

Drak watches es I flight of arrows slam into the milling ranks of apes
Right in front of him an arrow rips through the throat of the leader of
the Praetorian Guard Drak turns to Nazgul yelling -

DRAK

The ones in the river - take themi Nazgul spurs his horse back across the
weir

ON THE SHORE

Ape cavalry and infantry scramble up the river bank Bam They hear the
charges go off - the hurl themselves down Another volley of arrows scythes
through them -

IN THE FOREST

The Eagle leader and his men work feverishly to reload and recharge the
batteries of crossbows One of the warriors looks up - terror on his face

Drak followed by the remnants of his Praetorian Guard charge through the
blue haze of gunsmoke - straight towards them

One of the crossbow batteries fires Arrows hit his horses armor but Drak
doesnt falter Crouched Iow in the saddle he spins the Gatling gun like a
gunslinger He locks it under his arm

The eagle warriors start to break and run The apes horses sound like
thunder rolling closer The Eagle leader and several of his warriors stand
their ground desperately working to reload

They spin the battery sighting straight at Draks chest They fire Arrows
fly -

Drak leaps out of the saddle He catches hold of an overhanging bough The
arrows whiz underneath skimming his butt He leaps again - higher into the
tree

The Eagle leader looks up - sunlight sparkles on the leaves Its dazzling

Smash Draks sword cleaves through one of the warriors Drak has dropped
to the ground right behind them The Eagle leader turns - too latel
Rat-a-tat-tat The Gatling gun fires Arrows shred the Eagle leaders
feathered coat He crumples to the ground like some fallen bird

THE FORD

The ape infantry pour across the ford charging over the bodies of their
fallen comrades

THE FOREST

Riderless horses part of the ape cavalry charge wildly through the trees
We tilt up - their riders have abandoned them and taken to the trees The
branches are thick with apes firing cutting down groups of running
tribesmen

THE ROCK PLATFORM

Wi and several tribesmen hurl camouflage aside revealing a long iron
barrel wedged in the rocks One of the warriors tilts it up aiming it at
the trees another stokes pebbles and scraps of metal into the barrel

Wi touches an ember to a fuse Everyone dives for cover -

Boom The primitive cannon fires The shrapnel hits the trees Shredded
apes branches and leaves fall to the ground

Wi and the warriors reload Again they fire - but the charge is too big
The whole cannon breaks free of the rocks It flies like a missile and
smashes into the trunk of a tree Timber

A ROCKY GORGE

Its rugged walls are lined with piles of huge boulders Aragorn and a group
of warriors are fighting hand-to-hand being forced back by scores of ape
infantry

Aragorn drives his spear at a huge ape The point plunges into the animals
belly up and under his armor Blood spurts out from the joins in the
metal
IN THE TREES

An ape sharpshooter sights down his crossbow - straight at Aragorn He
fires -

AMONG THE BOULDERS

Wham The crossbow bolt smashes into Aragorns shoulder sending him
reeling One of the tribesmen turns - its Kip He sees Aragorn on his
knees

Kip wields a sword fighting his way towards Aragorn Slash He takes one
ape across the chest Whaml Another ape in the neck He grabs Aragorn and
starts to drag him out of the melee

IN THE TREES

The ape sharpshooter has Kip in his sights His finger reaches for the
trigger He starts to squeeze -

Sswhishl The sound of an arrow Whackl It buries itself in the
sharpshooters neck He falls out of the tree -

HIGH AMONG THE BOULDERS

Will He stands almost at the top of the gorge lowering a crossbow He
looks down at Kips men - the apes vastly superior in numbers are
swarming forward driving the tribesmen back

On a ridge below him four tribesmen scramble away from huge boulder A
flash of fire then - Ka-bam

ON THEGROUND

Apes are rushing forward They hear the explosion Several apes turn - the
huge boulder split into chunks flies towards them The apes scatter
Smashl The chunks knock apes aside like skittles

But theres more of them behind spilling in to the gorge over-running it

THE DUST FROM THE EXPLOSION

swirls past Drak He looks up - he sees Will on the ridge silhouetted
against the sky

Drak snarls deep in his throat He wheels his horse and gallops hard
towards a trail that winds up among the boulders

ON THE RIDGE

Will moves fast along the top of the ridge He stops - looking down on the
river On the other side Nazgul and a platoon of apes unload huge leather
bladders from the wagons and empty them into the river

Will shades hil ayes - the water glistens with iridescent colors He
realizes - its oil

The current carries it straight towards the platform in the river The
warriors of the Rainbow tribe - unaware - are still aboard firing at the
apes on the ford

Will turns fait - wa whip pan along the shoreline He sees what he feared -
two apes below him with a fire burning They slot flaming arrows into their
crossbows —

Will unslings his crossbow steadies himself and fires -

Ks-whack The arrow rips through one apes neck He pitches forward -
heed-first into the fire The other ape hurls himself aside diving for

cover

Will re-loads The side of the apes head is just visible behind a rock If
Will makes this its going to be a helluva shot

His finger curls around the trigger - right behind him the sound of
hooves Will spins

its Drak charging towards him He raises the Gatling gun -
Will aims at the big apes throat and fires

Drak swerves The arrow misses his throat but slams into his exposed
forearm The Gatling gun flies from his hand

Theres no time for Will to re-load - he turns and runs
Drak charges down on him He draws a harpoon out of its scabbard
Will scrambles over a crest - nothing but thin air

Drak has him square in his sights He draws back his arm about to hurl the
harpoon Will throws himself forward -

THE SIDE OF A CLIFF

Will falls down down down

Drak reins his horse to a halt right at the edge He looks over - Will
plunges towards the river flowing fast below the ford

Splash Will cannonballs into the water and disappears Drak stares down
trying to catch sight of him Nothing

IN THE RIVER

A tree branch and other flotsam is being carried downstream by the current
A pair of hands emerge from the water and grab hold of it Wills head
follows

Gasping catching his breath he looks upstream - the water pours over the
weir A flaming arrow arcs through the air The ape on the shore has done
his job -
THE OIL SLICK

erupts in flames as the arrow hits it The whole surface of the river is
suddenly transformed into a raging blaze

The Rainbow leader and his men turn They see a wall of flame racing
towards them Several warriors dive into the water swimming for the shore

Whoosh The flames engulf them A wall of fire sweeps over the wooden
platform Like macabre shadows - we see the dancing shapes of the dying
warriors

IN THE RIVER

The current pulls Will down the river He looks back - the molten fire
spills over the weir Anguished screams are carried on the wind A pillar
of black oily smoke rises up high into the sky -

THE EAGLES NEST

The platforms and rocky outcrops are crowded with the women children and
old folks Diamond and Strider stand together All of them stare down at
the river valley The pillar of smoke rises higher

WOMAN (0S)
Theyre here

Diamond turns - the woman is standing on the highest platform Diamond
follows the direction of her outstretched arm

A group of warriors followed by their women-folk and children are coming
round the mountain path Their leader wears a golden fur and a head-dress
of aurochs horns Its the Tribe of the Antelope

OUTSIDE THE MAIN CAVE

A chorus of chattering voices The new arrivals are surrounded by members
of their sister tribes The leader of the Antelope stands in the center
listening to a woman -Kips wife Whatever shes saying is lost in the
hubbub

ANTELOPE

Quiet

Instantly the voices die
ANTELOPE (CONTD)

(anxious)

Where

Kips wife doesnt answer - she walks forward and points to the pillar of
smoke The Antelope leader turns to his warriors

ANTELOPE (CONTD)

We go - now

DIAMOND AND STRIDER

stand on the platform watching several old men lower the drawbridge
Whack It locks into place The antelope warriors cross it and disappear
down a narrow trail

The rest of the Antelope tribe move towards the cave Diamond turns away -
then she stops Something has caught her eye She stares at the crowd of
women and children heading into the cave

STRIDER

What is it

Diamond doesnt answer - she tenses In the milling crowd of brown bodies
she sees it again - a flash of gold Its sunlight on blonde hair

DIAMOND

Shes here holy God - shes herel Its not a woman - its a child

She grabs a rope ladder ignores the rungs and slithers down it
A YOUNG GIRL

helps her mother set up camp She is about 10 years old tawny-haired
taller and straighter-backedthan any of her people She looks like us

Diamond pushes through the women and kids gathered around the hearth She
stops The young girl turns For a moment she and Diamond stare at one
another separated by a hundred thousand years but so similar they can
both see themselves in the other

THE YOUNG GIRL SMILES DIAMOND RETURNS IT -

DIAMOND

Whats your name

The girls mother stares amazed to see someone who looks like her child
MOTHER

Her name is Aiv

DIAMOND

Ev

(Realizing)
Of course My people have a name like that - Eve is how we say it
The mother nods - the sound seems to please her Diamond puts out her arms
and indicates the young girl The mother smiles giving her permission
Diamond puts her arms around Eve

DIAMOND (CONTD)

(softly)

Ive come a long way to find you

Eve looks at her - wide-eyed innocent

EVE

Why

DIAMOND

To keep you safe

She holds her tight The mother catches Diamonds eye

MOTHER

Do you have children

Diamond shakes her head - no The mother cant hide her disappointment
DIAMOND

Whats wrong

MOTHER

I was hoping you had a son Aivs a sweet girl Shes the child of my
heart But the way she looks nobody will want her as a mate

Before Diamond can answer theres a commotion outside the cave She turns
to look - Strider and tribes-people are running out into the daylight

SWIRLS OF DUST

rise up from I mountain path Whatevers causing it is hidden from view by
the peaks and crags The tribal-people gather on vantage points watching
it come closer Strider cocks his head - listening A shadow of fear passes
across his face

STRIDER
Horses Its horses
Horses mean apesi Panic sweeps through the tribes-people Women grab their

children young kids start screaming old men and boys scramble for
weapons
Diamond weaves through the flying mass of people She swings up on to a
platform beside Strider He points -

Coming into view on the mountain path - running and stumbling dragging
their wounded - are whats left of the Antelope warriors

Their women-folk cry out as they realize what has happened to their mates
The warriors race along the path and across the drawbridge Nobody raised
it when they left -

Several old men and a couple of boys struggle now to do it They haul on
the ropes and pulleys It starts to swing upwards -

Here he comes - Drak Hes galloping hard at the head of his cavalry
battle scarred and bloodied He sees the drawbridge starting to lift He

doesnt pause - he whips his horse into a thundering gallop

The bridge rises higher Draks horse leaps It soars across the crevasse -
the giddylng drop stretches out below - and lands on the lifting bridge

The men and boys stare in horror Orak charges down on them They back away
-all except one boy not even in his teens who stands his ground

Swish Draks sword cleaves him from shoulder to waist The other tribesmen
run Wham The drawbridge falls back into place The ape cavalry charge
across it

BROAD WOODEN PLATFORM

An ape horseman flies across the platform He leaps off the edge on to a
lower platform Diamonds right in front of him

She throws herself aside grabs hold of a rope ladder and drops onto -
A ROCK SHELF

She looks across the broad area in front of the cave - apes everywhere
weapons flashing people screaming

A young boy tries to out-run an ape warrior - its Gray Beard The young
boy hasnt got a chance Gray Beard lashes out at him with a stock-whip

It curls around the boys ankle tripping him The boy looks up - he tries
to shield his face Too late The horses hooves smash down -

Diamond looks away unable to watch She sees Eve The young girl is at the
front of the cave spinning in panic Her mother runs towards her

The mother doesnt see Gray Beard galloping towards her Diamond screams a
warning but its just one more crv in the commotion

Gray Beard raises a short-handled lance and hurls it like a javelin It
hits the mother in the small of the back straight through the spine She

pitches forward - dead Eve screams and runs towards her mother

Diamond leaps off the rock ledge -
IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Diamond runs faster than shes ever run sprinting to grab Eva Drak wheels
his horse - he sees Diamond His lip curls back and he smiles - one of the
Blue Eyes And a woman He leaps his horse forward -

DRAK
Grab the female

Gray Beard is off his horse Diamond runs towards him He raises a
crossbow

Drak charges down on her from behind He holds the harpoon at his shoulder
He aims at her legs

Diamond races on - her only thought to save Eve Itll never happen -
shes as good as deadGray Beards in front aiming Draks right behind He
hurls the harpoon

Whoosh Strider swings through the air He clings to one of the rope
ladders - its like Tarzan except hes an ape He grabs Diamond by the
scruff of the neck and yanks her out of the way

Draks harpoon skims past them Gray Beard stares in amazement at the woman
flying through the air But thats not his big surprise - with Diamond out
of the way the harpoon is flying straight at him He screams as it rips
into his throat

HIGH ROCK LEDGE

Strider - Diamond clutched under his arm - lands on a ledge high above the
fight Diamond turns fast and looks back -

IN FRONT OF THE CAVE

Eve crouches over the body of her mother The womans mouth is frozen in an
anguished scream her dead eyes stare straight ahead Eva shakes her
desperately hoping for some sign of life Nothing Eve starts to cry

A dark shadow falls across her She looks up - its Drak He reaches down
and grabs her by the neck He beats his chest with his fist and raises her
up above his head like a trophy

ON THE ROCK LEDGE

Diamond anguished tries to go to the little girl but Strider holds her in
an iron grip He swings Diamond off her feet and leaps for an overhanging
branch of a tree He jumpsfrom the tree to a jagged peak and vanishes from
sight

CHARRED AND SMOKING WRECKAGE

floats at the shore of the river It is what remains of the firing platform
- the bodies of several of the Rainbow warriors still on board

Smoke curls away from the platform and drifts through the forest The only
sound is the whinnying of a horse - it has a broken leg Again and again it
tries to get to its feet

A solitary figure makes his way through the shadows Its Will soaking wet
from the river He stops at the entrance to the rocky gorge and looks at
the carnage all around him So much for knowledge and science This is
where the warriors of the tribes made their last stand - their bodies lie
huddled together in a jumble

Will stares at them anguish on his face

WILL

(softly to himself

I was so sure

He kneels and turns one of the bodies over Its Kip - speared through the
chest A shaft of sunlight hits the Crescent of Light It glints on his
lifeless throat Gently he closes Kips glassy eyes

sound behind him Will hurls himself aside grabbing for a weapon He looks
up -its the Lookout battle-stained and weary Their eyes meet -

LOOKOUT

(quietly)

You said wed win

Will just nods - he knows

LOOKOUT (CONTD)

You gave us hope - that was the cruelest thing

The Lookout kneels and crosses Kips hands across his chest He reaches
down and removes the Crescent of Light He turns to Will -

LOOKOUT (CONTD)

Get the weapons you need The apesI1l be coming back for their dead Hurry
Will arms himself with crossbows and arrows from the bodies

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

rise into the sky - the eagles nest is on fire Drak and his apes make
their way along a narrow mountain trail - theyve put the humans camp to
the torch

With them is a long line of prisonerswomen and children mostly many of
them in tears They carry long poles over which are slung their dead and

dying We crane up to -

HUGE ROCK OVERHANG
high up the mountain-side Standing underneath it hidden in shadow are
Diamond and Strider They look down on the mountain trail Diamond sees
Eve

THE MOUNTAIN TRAIL

The young girl stumbles along the road tied by a length of chain to Draks
saddle Shes bruised and bleeding her ankles shackled barely able to
walk

THE ROCK OVERHANG

Diamond looks at her close to tears but theres nothing she can do She
watches the convoy wind along the trail

Boomi The fire must have hit a store of gunpowder - an explosion rips
through the eagles nest blowing out the side of one of the peaks Diamond
watches the dust climb into the sky All her hopes seem to be going with
it

IN THE RIVER

Its twilight Will and the Lookout are wading around a knob of land that
protects one end of a tiny beach

Will sees a fire burning on the sand a cave opening off the beach piles
of stones like burial mounds

WILL
What is this place
LOOKOUT

Its called the Crossroads of the Fallen King - its where our forefathers
are laid to rest Its sacred to us - anyone whos still alive will make
their way here

They wade closer to the beach In the firelight they see groups of
tribesmen -survivors of the battle Women and children - the lucky few who

managed to flee the eagles nest - are binding the warriors wounds

They look up - everyone falls silent at the sight of Will As he comes
closer he recognizes a woman sitting alone -

WILL

Its Kips wife Shes come from

THE EAGLES NEST -

He goes towards her passing the other tribes-people Nobody greets him
They just watch him pass He stops in front of Kips wife Her eyes are red

from crying

WILL
rm sorry about your mate
She says nothing - she just stares at him Will keeps going -
WILL (CONTD)

Ive been to the eagles nest I was looking for the woman I was with We
searched but

(he pauses)

What happened - was she captured

KIPS WIFE

I threw myself off a platform I dont know what happened to anyone

Will nods He gets to his feet and moves to the women near the fire We
dont hear what he says but we know what he is asking One after another
they shake their heads - no they know nothing of Diamond

SHAFT OF MOONLIGHT

shimmers on the water Will sits on a rock that straggles into the water
His face is grim his heart heavy with grief Hes making something with
his hands - twisting and turning them - but in the dim light we cant see
what it is

INSIDE THE CAVE

A shaft of moonlight falls on a semi-circle of rock slabs standing on their
end - its like Stonehenge The surviving tribes-people are gathered in
their shadow

OLD MAN

Its half a day since the battle Any that survived would be here by now -
we are all that remains of the Seven Tribes The Ranger himself died on the

field We must decide ourselves what to do

Silence for a moment They have spent too long following a leader for
discussion to come easily Finally a wounded warrior speaks -

WOUNDED WARRIOR

Like you say Kip is dead Maybe its a sign -the Rangers have left Middle
Earth forever Perhaps its telling us to do the same

A young woman - probably in her 20s - shakes her head
YOUNG WOMAN

Leave the valley This is where the eagles fly This is their home Nobody
can live without their totem - we all know that

LOOKOUT
Nobody can live with the apes eitherl If we stay here we die But if we
travel beyond the Tower of the Moon weve got a chance Who knows - maybe
our totems will follow us

Theres a murmur of agreement It grows louder tribes-people nodding their
heads

THE BEACH

Now we see what Will has been making - its a boat made out of twigs and
leaves A tiny hull and a gaff-rigged mast He leans forward and drops it
in the water He watches the current carry it away Farther and farther it
bobs out into the river -

WILL

(softly)

Im sorry Billie I should have listened - it wasnt our war All you
wanted was a baby

He cant go on He watches the tiny boat disappear around the knob of land
IN THE RIVER

The current carries the boat past a jagged boulder An apes hand reaches
out and picks it up He lifts it up to look more closely We see his face -
its Strider He turns the toy over in his hand looking at it quizzically
He hands it to Diamond wading along behind him -

STRIDER

It looks like someone made it

DIAMOND

Its a boat - its gaff-rigged

(realizing)

Oh Jesus

She plunges forward wading as fast as she can

DIAMOND (CONTD)

Will

ON THE BEACH

Will is walking up the beach He stops listening He hears it again -his
name He turns and heads towards the river He sees Diamond coming round

the headland splashing through the water

Will stops They look at one another - then they both move forward arms
stretching out They wrap their arms around each other
WILL

(softly)

I thought Id lost you

DIAMOND

I thought you were dead

They keep holding each other

WILL

How did you find this place

DIAMOND

Strider His father was a tracker Weve been following a trail for hours
Will looks over her shoulder - Strider is wading towards them
DIAMOND (CONTD)

He saved my life Will

Will goes to greet him The man and the ape embrace

WILL

Thank you my friend - thank you

STRIDER

What did you expect You would have done the same for me
SHOWER OF SPARKS

as Will puts a log on the fire From inside the cave we hear the murmur of
voices as the argument goes back and forth

Both Diamond and Strider are wrapped in furs - their clothes are laid out
next to the fire drying Will speaks to Diamond -

WILL

Some times when we want something so bad we can take a thing and twist it
in our head Youre sure about this Billie

DIAMOND

Im pregnant Will - Im not crazy Shes not like them - shes a mutation
Evolutions always trying to improve on itself Its turned out a child
that can walk taller and run faster one whose brain-pan holds a mind that
can think laterally Ive seen her Will Ive held her in my arms - she
was us
Will looks at her Theres no doubt - he believes her

WILL

You said she was with Drak

DIAMOND

On a chain

WILL

Its two days march to the city Was she wounded - can she make it
DIAMOND

She can make it

(a beat - she looks at him)

Will

Before he can answer the Old Man and several others come down the beach -
OLD MAN

Its decided - were leaving the valley forever

(turns to Strider)

Your people have won - the Seven Tribes of Middle Earth have been broken
Long may their spirits haunt you

(he turns back to Will

You and your mate can travel with u but weve got misery enough to carry
Our hearth is not home to ny ape

WILL

Then its not home to us The apes better than any man Ive known
The Old Mans lip curls in a sneer He shrugs and walks away
STRIDER

Go with them Will - everyone needs their own kind

Will and Diamond newer almost simultaneously -

WILL

No

DIAMOND

Of course we cant
(to Will)

The city Will

Will and Strider turn nd look at her - incredulous

WILL

We call it a city - its more like a fortress Billie It cant be done
DIAMOND

The three of you got out - everyone thought that was impossible too
WILL

We were lucky But thats the trouble with luck - it runs out I dont want
to be back in the city when it does

DIAMOND

What about Eve - what do we do just forget about her

WILL

No Maybe we cant stop the apes giving her the disease - but theyll have
to turn her loose Thats the only way she can infect others So we lay a
plan and we find her Then its our job to stop her having children If we
can do that it cant be passed on through the race

She shrugs Thats the only thing I can think of

DIAMOND

How long will that take - less than twenty-five days

WILL

No

DIAMOND So what of my child

We have to face it - youre going to lose it

She turns away trying to keep her emotions in check Will comes to her
side -

WILL (CONTD)

We cant take our eye off the goal If we solve this you can have other
children Not if wa throw our lives away though

DIAMOND

Whose Will - whose children
She looks at him He meets her gaze A beat

WILL

guess thats your call

DIAMOND

What sort of father would you make You told me once the only thing that
matters is knowledge Thats wrong Science and technology can only take
you so far - in the end its our humanity that maners Thats what makes us
great Youre a wonderful scientist Will -but what sort of person are you
What would you do if it was your child

She looks straight into his eyes Finally he answers Softly -

WILL

I dont know how to do it - not the humanity part thats easy compared to
getting into the city I just dont know

He picks up a stick and starts to scratch out a rough map on the ground
WILL (CONTD)

It sits on a river Theres only one bridge -heavily guarded Even if we
could cross it all the ridges and roads are patrolled -

STRIDER

Theres one place thats not

Both Diamond and Will turn to him He takes the stick -

STRIDER (CONTD)

Down here - its called Funeral Rock It sits at the bottom of the temple
From there you can make your way into the city Even so you still have to
cross the river

He draws an arrow across the water illustrating the problem Diamond is
about to speak but she looks at Will - hes staring at the arrow an idea
half formed is starting to form

WILL

Maybe there is a wayacross the river I mean

DIAMOND

How

Will turns to her -

WILL

Youll love it - theres barely any science to it at all
DIAMOND

Were going Is that right - were going
Their eyes meet and hold He smiles at her
THREE SILHOUETTES

travel fast along a high ridge The sun - a fiery disc - rises right behind
them We recognize their physiques - Will in the lead then Diamond and
Strider As they cross the face of the sun we dissolve to -

LIGHTS TWINKLE

on the buildings and terraces of the apes city Will and his two comrades
are on a bluff looking down The sound of music and laughter drifts
towards them on the night air Suddenly a huge tongue of flame shoots out
of a stone chimney

STRIDER

Theyve started up the furnace

(softly)

Let the games begin

DIAMOND

What games

WILL

The apes kill their prisoners for sport The furnace takes care of the
bodies

Diamond - sickened by it - turns to look at Will Already hes heading off
leading them down nrrow trail

A HIDDEN LEDGE

much closer to the city Will and the others move fast along it deep in
the shadows The river thunders by below them separating them from the
city The only way across is the massive iron and wood bridge Ape guards
patrol it

Only Diamond pauses to look et it Will and Strider urge her forward It
disappears from view

A STEEL ARROW

flies through the air Tied to its shaft trailing out behind is a rope
made from vines Will lowers a crossbow He watches the arrow fly through
the mist and spray -

THE RIVER
races by just below and pours over the Falls of No Return Whack The arrow
buries itself in the trunk of a massive tree standing on the bank

ON THE OTHER SHORE

Will and Strider haul the rope taut and tie it round a tree It stretches
from one side of the river to the other All it has to do is hold Will
turns to Diamond He shouts to be heard over the roar of the falls -

WILL

You first Well be right behind

Diamond scrambles up on to a rock platform and grabs hold of the rope She
looks across the riverthe moonlight spills through the wind-blown spray
the roaring water rushes by the rope hangs like a thread Theres fear on
her face -

WILL (CONTD)

You ready

DIAMOND

It sure as shit aint Kansas is it

WILL

Go

Diamond throws herself forward Her feet leave the platform Hand over hand
she goes - out across the river

Will watchel for a moment then launches himself - his hands wrap around the
rope

Strider slings his crossbow over his shoulder and jumps The line bows
under his weight Diamondl feet drop closer to the water She looks down -

the mass of black water flecked with foam rushes past

Will looks ahead - Diamond is almost lost in flurries of spray Shes
dripping wet hauling herself forward -

The sound of the Falls is deafening Right below her a huge swirling
hole opens up Its a whirlpool She starts to swing across it Joltl

THE TREE TRUNK

The arrow pulls part way out of the tree The steel shaft shivers but it
holds Everything seems okay Suddenly -

Snap One of the strands of the vine breaks -
ON THE ROPE

Everything bucks and shudders Diamond screams She looks down - straight
into the vortex of the whirlpool Her blood runs cold - she freezes
WILL SEES HER HANGING MOTIONLESS ON THE ROPE HE SCREAMS AT HER -
WILL

Go Billie - go

She doesnt seem to hear Her eyes are wide with fear - staring down down
into the whirlpools bottomless well

WILL TRYING TO GET TO HER HURLS HIMSELF FORWARD THE ROPE STRAINS AND
BOWS -

WILL
Move

She doesnt react Strider watches as Will tries to catch up The rope is
swaying so much its agonizingly slow

Diamond stares at a huge log spinning down into nothingness The whirlpool
seems to be swallowing everything even the moonlight -

WILL (CONTD)
Billiai What about the baby

The word hits her She pulls her eyes from the swirling death She looks at
Will

WILL (CONTD)
Move Billiel Nowl

She understands She starts to pull herself forward Will slumps with
relief -

ON THE SHORE

The arrow moves another inch out of the trunk The rope fixed to its shaft
is strained to breaking point But still everything holds

THE IRON AND WOOD BRIDGE

One of the guards patrols the bridge Out of the corner of his eye - flash
of something He looks towards the Falls

GUARD

(calling)

Gimla

The other guard joins him They peer through the night at the spray rising

from the Falls They see it again - above the river a flash of light on
metal
The keep watching An eddy of wind clears the mist for a second They see
Strider going hand over hand along the rope moonlight glinting on his
crossbow

ON THE SHORE

Another strand of the rope breaks We follow it as it unravels - past
Diamond and Will Before we get to Strider it stops - a section of the rope
is so badly frayed it cant go any farther Its going to break any moment
Screech A siren wails

STRIDER

Theyve seen usl Will looks up-river to the bridge Through a hole in the
mist he sees ape guards pointing and yelling A whole squadron runs to join
them

Diamond throws herself forward - she makes the shorel

Will and Strider give it everything theyve got Striders first hand
passes the frayed section Hes following it with his second -

Snap The whole rope breaks Will - closest to the shore - plunges into the
ripping current But at leaIt hes clinging to the rope with both hands
Striders in the water hanging on to the end of the rope by the fingers of
one paw Will turns and reaches for him

STRIDER (CONTD)

No Save yourselfl

ON THE SHORE

Diamond has grabbed hold of the rope and is trying to pull it in The
weight - of the men and the current - make it impossible All she can do is
try and hold them

ON THE ROPE

Striders fingers are slipping free Will grabs him - man and ape hand to
paw Will holds him

STRIDER

Well both die Let gol Will shakes his head - no Hanging on to the rope
one-handed the current tearing at his body he tries to haul Strider in

Whizz An arrow flies past just missing them and plunges into the water
The apes on the bridge are firing

STRIDER (CONTD)
Another minute well both be dead Do it Willl

Will tries again to drag Strider to the rope Another arrow flies through
the mist and spray - even closer Strider reaches out with his free hand
He starts to prize Wills fingers loose -

STRIDER (CONTD)

If nothing else I made it to the Falls No Return

Will realizes - nothing is going to stop Strider

WILL

The sacred words Strider - what are the words
STRIDER

In the beginning

WILL

In the beginning was the word and the word wes God
STRIDER

(in wonder)

You know the words

WILL

Youll walk in the next world Strider

STRIDER

How do you know

WILL

Ive seen the future havent I

Strider smiles at him - a smile of perfect peace
STRIDER

Good-bye Will Take care of Billie

He twists Wills last finger free He drops - the swirling river carries
him away Will is close to tears but he wont let himself cry Two more
arrows sizzle past -

WILL

And the word was God Yea though I walk through the valley of death I
will fear no evil

Strider spins down the river through the spray and foam

WILL (0S) (CONTD)
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I
will dwell in the house of the Lord forever Amen

Strider one arm raised plunges over the Falls

ON THE BRIDGE

We see whos been coordinating the firing Its Drak Archers are kneeling
on the bridge trying to sight a target through the foaming water and

clouds of mist

Drak never taking his eyes off of the river draws back the massive spring
of his crossbow and reloads

ON THE SHORE

Diamond ia hauling on the rope pulling it in Will up to his neck in
water tows himself along it His feet find a footing - he starts to
scramble up the bank Diamond goes towards him -

Just for a moment the mist clears

ON THE BRIDGE

moments long enough Draks seen him In one fluid movement he adjusts his
aim and fires -

ON THE SHORE

Diamond is almost in Wills arms Sswhack The arrow rips into WiUs back
through his ribs He pitches forward Diamond screams He falls into her
arms

The mist closes around them

HUGE STONE ARCH

The survivors of the Seven Tribes travel fast along a forest trail All of
them are burdened down with possessions weary from the road - they are

leaving the valley

Kips Wife and the Old Man are in the lead They pass through the arch out
into a clearing In the middle of it is a fire shadows camped around it -

Kips wife and the other survivors stop in fear One of the shadows rises
from the fire Bathed in moonlight - almost ghost-like - he comes towards
them Its Aragorn

Kips wife moves forward and embraces him -

KIPS WIFE

We thought you were dead

ARAGORN
Hunted but not dead A dozen of us were driven back in the battle -

He indicates his men They are coming forward greeting the survivors The
Young Woman sees her mate - she cries out They hold each other

ARAGORN (CONTD)

For three days a squadron of apes have tracked us Last night we ambushed
them Were heading now for the eagles nest

KIPS WIFE

(softly)

There is no eagles nest

Aragorn stares at her not wanting to believe it

KIPS WIFE (CONTD)

Were all thats left of the Seven Tribes

Grief wells up inside Aragorn We hold on his face

A FIRE CRACKLES

All of the tribes-people are gathered around it

OLD MAN

There is no-one else Aragorn - you are the Ranger

ARAGORN

(shaking his head)

No We must all follow the trail we think best Youve decided yours For
me Ill go to the city of the apes and take what revenge I can Ill go
alone - but like the traveler I think death will be the only thing I find
there

OLD MAN

Then it will find us too Warriors follow their Ranger Thats always been
the way of it in Middle Earth

ARAGORN

But nothings the same now Think of the women-folk What will become of
them

KIPS WIFE

Youre right - theres so few of us now nothing is the same You must
allow the women to follow too

ARAGORN But women cant fight
KIPS WIFE Women have never been allowed to fight That doesnt mean they
cant

All the women nod their assent The men smile agreeing Everyone waits for
Aragorn to decide A beat - then he nods his head and smiles

The tribes-people start to cheer The Lookout steps forward From out of
the folds of his fur he takes the Crescent of Light All of the tribe
stare at it

LOOKOUT

I found it on the battlefield There were those who said the Rangers had
left Middle Earth forever - I didnt know what to do with it

He hands it to Aragorn The whole tribe watches as the proud man once again
ties the talisman of his rank around his neck

ARAGORN
Douse the fire The Seven Tribes are going to war
ON THE SHORE

The apes carrying torches search the river bank and surrounding cliffs
We push in on a pool of darkness behind them -

Will and Diamond hide in a hollow beneath the tangled roots of a huge tree
They have done their best to dress Wills wound but hes obviously in a lot
of pain -

DIAMOND

You cant go on Will - not like this

WILL

What about the baby

DIAMOND

Ill keep going - Ill try and get Eve

WILL

Alone Dont be ridiculous -

He starts to haul himself to his feet His face twists in pain - he has to
stop

DIAMOND
Look at you - you can barely walk

He puts out his hand needing I boost up
WILL

If I can just get up - help me

Diamond shakes her head - no They look at one another
WILL (CONTD)

Dont do this to me - pleasel

DIAMOND

Youve done enough - more than anyone else could Youre one of the finest
men

Ive ever known - but its over Will Youre going to have to wait Now
its my turn -

She grabs her weapons and starts to leave Will makes it to his feet -
WILL

BillieShes almost through the tangled roots

WILL (CONTD)

I made a mistake once - I went on a journey with someone I loved At the
end I let her go into danger alone

Diamond stops

DIAMOND

Where was that - Berkeley Will

She turns and looks at him He nods his head - yes

DIAMOND (CONTD)

What happened

WILL

I knew Id found the chemical key I was working with three young
researchers One of them was a woman called Ali Conoily We were engaged
They were the ones that went into the tanks I didnt know as much as I
thought I did They died in there

DIAMOND

Why didnt you go Will

WILL

We all wanted to It was a great adventure Wa drew lots for it I should

never have agreed but we were young - and like the young we thought life
would last forever
DIAMOND

Robert Plant died too didnt he - in a way

WILL

The experiment was unauthorized There was an inquiry They said the theory
had no basis Ludicrous was a word they used My career had gone up like
a rocket It came down like the stick I couldnt find work anywhere

DIAMOND

Will Robinson - that was your joke I guess You were Lost in Space were
you

WILL

Yeah but I never realized itd be so appropriate

They sort of smile at one another

WILL (CONTD)

had twenty years to work out where my research went wrong - so what
though It was just a mind game But Ive learnt a lot of things - the most
important is that sometimes you get a second chance A second chance for a
lot of things -

He looks straight at her They hold each others eyes

WILL (CONTD)

And when you do you have to grab it and make sure you never let it go
Ive got the heart Billie Its my body thats failing me

Neither one of them moves A beat
DIAMOND

Give me your hand Will

She helps him to his feet

A GIANT CHASM

Its several hours before dawn In the gloom - whooshl Kips Wife rides a
flying fox across a precipitous drop

She lands on the other side of a jagged ravine The rest of the tribe all
heavily armed are waiting there They turn end run fading into the trees

THE FUNERAL ROCK

juts out into the roaring river Will and Diamond scramble out of the
darkness and land on the rock Wills face is haggard with pain but he
forces himself forward Hes loosening up going faster as he moves -
They pass through the huge legs of the stone ape - into the Temple
A DARKENED ROOM

Torches flicker on the walls From somewhere close-by - muffled - we hear
the sound of a crowd A young ape barely in his teens stands in the
middle of the room almost naked His face is painted with strange ochre
markings

A circle of ape warriors watch as Ma-Gog lifts a slender blade Intoning
words in some strange tongue he slices the blade across the Teenagers
forehead The Teenager winces but he doesnt cry out - this is his manhood
ceremony

THE STABLES

The sound of the crowd is much louder here but still we dont see them The
prisoners from the Eagles Nest are crowded into the corrals

One of the gates is thrown open Three ape guards enter They push the
tribes-people aside and grab a 12-year old boy His mother clings to him
screaming One of the guards drags her off and they haul the boy out of the
corral

AN ARENA

-like a small bullring - in the center of the stables Now we see the crowd
- apes all males sit in the bleachers They roar as a door is opened and
the young Tribe-Boy is pushed into the ring

He looks around the arena - yelling screaming apes Terror on his face An
even louder roar goes up The Boy turns -

The Teenage ape steps out of a tunnel the ochre markings on his face like
war-paint the blood barely dried on his forehead He carries spears anda
club

One of the apes throws a couple of captured human weapons down to the Boy
The Teenage ape moves in on him He is a warrior now - this is going to be

his first kill

IN THE CORRAL

The Boys mother is huddled down being comforted by other tribes-people A
huge roar goes up from the arena as the first blow is struck The sound
carries over to -

A TERRACE

Drak is alone walking a high ridge He stops looking down on the
twinkling lights The city is virtually deserted but Drak doesnt move -
hes uneasy troubled by something he cant put a name to

THE COOL AND LOVELY ROOM

The five baby apes sit on cots They watch as Doctor Zora inserts a syringe
into the smallest apes arm The baby starts to cry Doctor Zora comforts
her as she draws out a cup of blood She turns to her assistant Ben-Guri

DOCTOR ZORA

Is the girl animal ready
BEN-GURI

Theyre doing it now
INSIDE THE LABORATORY

Eve is struggling and crying as an ape guard carries her towards an
operating table He and another guard start to strap her down

The Vet works at the bench heating a steel needle over a flame Its the
same sort of catheter that was used on Will - one end of the needle
attached to a long tube A knock on the door

VET
That must be Zors with the blood

One of the guards goes and unbolts the door He recoils - its Will
Sswhack He fires the first bolt from a double-barreled crossbow It takes
the guard in the chest

He and Diamond dive into the room Eve starts hollering The second guard
is wheeling crossbow rising He rifle-butts Diamond across the head Her
weapon goes flying

The guard is aiming Will is on the floor tumbling Barely time to aim on
his back firing overhead he shoots -

Whack Bullseye The arrow hits the guard dead in the heed

The Vet grabs the first guards fallen crossbow He aims at Will Diamond
screams a warning but theres nothing Will can do - hes struggling to
reload one-handed because of his wounds

Diamond - unarmed - scoops the red-hot syringe off the bench The Vet
reaches for the trigger Diamond leaps forward She drives the syringe into
his chest

The Vet stands goggle-eyed Diamond must have found his heart - a torrent
of blood pours down the clear tube It spills on to the floor The Vet
topples forward

Slash Slash Will cuts throughthe straps that tie Eve to the table
OUTSIDE THE HALL OF LEARNING

Drak turns a corner of the building He stops and touches the ground with

his finger He lifts it to his mouth and tastes it He rises to his feet
following trail of blood
A TORCH

is ripped from a bracket Its Drak He shines it down into a stone well
The flame splits the darkness Floating in the water at the bottom of the
well is an ape guard -dead an arrow through his throat

IN THE ARENA
The Tribe-Boy is sprawled in the dust bleeding badly from a rip across his
ribs His spear lies next to him a wooden shield raised across his head

The Teenage ape rains blows down on it with a sword

The apes in the bleachers are cheering wildly Smash The shield splinters
The sword slices the Boys arm -

APES

Kill Kill Kill

The Boy stares up - the Teenage smiles and raises his sword

Shriek The alarm sounds Everything freezes Then officers are on their
feet yelling orders Ape soldiers grab their weapons heading for the
doors

The Teenage ape looks around robbed of his moment The Boy sees his

chance He raises his spear and drives it deep into the apes groin He
staggers and falls - on top of the Boy

The apes pour out of the arena The siren carries over to -
A STONE CORRIDOR

Wills got Eve slung over his shoulder Theyre stumbling down a corridor -
past other labs and research rooms They burst through a sat of doors into

A COURTYARD

at the back of the Hall of Learning Its deep in shadow From behind they
hear the sound of pounding feet Will looks around not sure which way to
go He glances across a terrace - the doors to the stables fly open The
ape warriors charge out

WILL

Can you ride

Diamond nods her head - yes He thrusts Eve into her hands -

WILL (CONTD)

Go for the stables Head for the eagles nest Ill try to join you there

Diamond hesitates - she doesnt want to leave him

DIAMOND
What are you going to do

WILL

Delay them Now go Billie Go

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

rops down the side of the ravine Standing on it are Nazgul and about

THE PRIMITIVE ELEVATOR

a dozen Praetorian Guards Nazgul looks down - torches and fires in drums
are lighting up the streets and terraces Ape soldiers are running
everywhere - searching

ON THE GROUND

The flame-thrower rolls along a street The drivers canopy is hidden by
flapping tarpaulins In the chaos nobody pays it any attention

ON THE ELEVATOR

Nazgul sees the machine rolling towards them
NAZGUL

Thats strange - why does Drak need the Flame

Suddenly he realizel He turns screaming up at the apes controlling the
mechanism

NAZGUL (CONTD)

Stopl Take it backl

THE FLAME-THROWER

dead guard is draped over the side of the machine blood dripping from his
headWill is in the cabin working the controls He sees the elevator slow
in mid-descent He throws a lever forward For a moment nothing Then -
Whoosh A huge tongue of flame blasts out of the barrel

Two of the guards are trying to climb the ropes Nazgul is wheeling around
in a panic The flame hits them The whole wooden structure catches fire
We see the apes through the flames struggling and writhing

The ropes burn through The blazing structure plummets down -

THE CENTRAL SQUARE

Smash It hits the ground in a shower of blazing timbers and dead apes Ape

soldiers - standing nearby - stare in shock The smell of roasted ape fills
the air
EVE SITS ALONE

Shes on the floor of the stables deep in shadow Shes scared looking
ahead -

The first weak light of dawn shines through the open doors We see an ape
guard keys jangling from his waist on petrol

He hears something - a rock falling a rustle of movement Raising his
weapon he moves towards a pool of black shadow past a pile of rocks into

an alcove

Diamond rises out of the rocks behind him He spins - shes got her
cross-bow raised Point-blank range She nails him

THE PRISONERS

are shackled in the corrals They see Diamond running out of the shadows
towards them She tossel them the keys -

DIAMOND

Arm yourselves Find Will - he needs youl She turns and goes The prisoners
start to unlock the chains

EVE

smiles as Diamond races out of the shadows sweeps her up and keeps
running

IN THE ARENA

The Teenage ape and the Boy lie where they fell their spilt blood staining
the dust

The Boys mother scrambles over the deserted bleachers and goes to her son
e drags off the ape Her sons eyes are closed his arms lacerated his
est wounded and crusted with blood She stares at him - he doesnt move

Qan

She starts to sob The Boys eyes flicker open They look at one another
The motheY gathers him into her arms Hes alive Hes alive

The sound of a horse The mother turns fearful She looks across the
arena through a railing -

IN THE CORRALS

Diamond gallops a stallion through the corrals Eves clutching the saddle
in front of her - hair flying her eyes sparkling with exhilaration The
stallion gallops faster

The prisoners - unchaining the last of their comrades - turn and look Its
a magnificent sight Diamond is crouched Iow over the flying horse
Straight ahead - a railed fence part of the corral

She leaps the horse over it They land In front - another hurdle Again
she does it
The prisoners stare Diamond charges towards the open doors of the stables
CLOUDS OF SMOKE AND FLAME

The crashed elevator hal set the surrounding buildings on fire Ape city is
burning

The Flame stands on a steep incline its back wedged against the wall of a
terrace Whooshl Fire shoots out of its barrel as Will keeps a horde of ape
soldiers at bay

The soldiers turn - Drak surrounded by the Praetorian Guard gallops
straight towards them Hel not stopping for anything - the soldiers
scramble aside

IN THE CABIN

Will sees Drak and the guards appear through the swirling clouds of smoke
They look like the horsemen of the apocalypse As Will throws the lever we
sea a primitive gauge above his head Its in the red -

IN THE SQUARE

Whoosh The tongue of flame shoots through the smoke It touches the guards
with a deadly kiss throwing them screaming from their horses But Drak
blasts through -

IN THE CABIN

Will is engulfed in a backdraft of black oily smoke He peers through it -
Drak charges towards him Will hits the lever again The flame erupts from
the barrel Then it dies - out of fuel

WILL

Shit

IN THE SQUARE

Drak gallops forward He raises weapon - a shoulder-mounted harpoon He
aims -

IN THE CABIN

Will throws himself aside He smashes both hands down on a lever on the
floor A hiss of steam The machine lurches forward -

IN THE SQUARE
Drak tries to get a clear shot at Will The machine gathers speed down the
incline coming straight towards Drak He veers his horse aside and wheels

around He charges alongside the cabin - its empty

ON THE MACHINE

Will clings to the outside of the Flame as it roars across the smoke-filled
square Hes out of sight of Drak - but not for long The ape and his
stallion loom into view behind the machine Will scrambles back into the
cabin -

IN THE SQUARE
Apes are scattering as the runaway machine flies across the square Drak is
at full gallop veering from one side of the Flame to the other Will

clambers back and forth - cat and mouse at full tilt

Drak swings his horse close to the back of the machine He stands up in the
stirrups the harpoon clamped to his shoulder - hes going on board

The Flame flies out of the square and down a street An ape throws himself
into a doorway - just in time Drak steadies himself about to jump
Suddenly his horse whinnies wildly Drak looks ahead - holy shit Theyre
heading straight for the front of a blazing house

Drak throws himself down into the saddle and hauls on the reins Will hurls
himself back into the cabin arms shielding his head Smash The Flame
crashes through the front wall -

INSIDE THE HOUSE

The barrel of the Flame acts like a battering ram - it blasts through the
walls in a shower of burning timbers It crashes through the kitchen and
stops in a courtyard

Will clambers out of the cabin and drops to the ground A yell goes up -
apes are coming through the adjoining houses Will turns and heads down an
alleyway

CITY STREET

Diamonds horse flies down a street - a high terrace towers on one side a
row of burning buildings on the other The road turns right She swings
around it - apes A platoon of them right in front of her She screams at
Eve -

DIAMOND
Hold on

She throws herself aside pulling on the reins The horse spins in a
U-turn grazing past a burning building Diamond gallops back the way she
came

Crash The wall of a burning building in front of her collapses Blazing
beams block the road The horse shies away Diamond wheels him around -

The apes race into the road She looks around desperately - shes trapped
She grabs Eve and awingl her onto the saddle behind her - shell be safer
there

She spurs the horse forward and crouches Iow in the saddle - shes going to
charge straight through the apes They drop to one knee - the firing
position - and raise their weapons A dozen crossbowl aim straight at
Diamond

Theres no way out - she flies towards them Whizzl The sound of arrows
But its not the apes - they go down like nine-pins

Diamond looks up - Aragorn has arrived Backlit by the rising sun the men

and women of the Tribes are pouring volley after volley into the apes
Nobody fires better than Kips Wife

Diamond leaps the horse through the dead and dying apes and turns down the
road

MA-GOG

stands on a terrace his cloak blowing in the wind his one cruel eye
blazing with anger Flanked by two ape warriors he looks down on the
burning buildings

The freed prisoners are waging a pitched battle outside the stables
Ma-Gog sees Will - hes running along the rooftops leaping from one
building to the next Ma-Gog points at him yelling at apes in the streets
below -

MA-GOG (CONTD)

Kill him In the name of God kill himl Sswhish The blade of a sword
cleaves through frame It cuts one of the ape warriors from neck to waist
Ma-Gog spins - its Aragorn armed to the teeth behind them

The second warrior goes for him Aragorn has dropped the sword He raises a
crossbow and fires The bolt shatters the apes armor and buries itself in
his chest

Ma-Gog swirls aside his cloak In his good hand he holds a double-edged
sword Aragorn drops the crossbow ands ducks beneath Ma-Gogs arcing blow
He lunges with a short-handled spear -

ARAGORN

For my people

It takes Ma-Gog in the gut His one eye bulges Aragorn rips the spear out

ARAGORN (CONTD)

And this - for my daughterl He drives the spear into the High Priests
heart The cruel eye flickers and dies

ON THE ROOFTOP

Will has seen it all He screams -
WILL

Behind you Aragorn - behind
ON THE TERRACE

Aragorn turns Its Drak on horseback thundering down on him But the
leader of the Seven Tribes knows no fear - only the memory of his lost
child

He raises his second spear and charges straight at Drak The huge ape
levels the shoulder-mounted harpoon He pulls the trigger Sswang The
powerful spring on the barrel releases the harpoon trails a length of rope
behind it -

Wham The harpoon smashes through Aragorns chest He dies as he falls
ON THE ROOFTOP
Will stares in anguish He turns away - he sees Diamond Shes at full

gallop - Eve clinging to her back - charging along a road several terraces
below Shes got a clear run for the iron bridge and freedom

Will looks across at Drak - hes seen her too For a moment the two of them
stare at one another Wills face is drawn and haggard from the injuries he
carries

Draks lip curls in a sneer - he knows hes going to win He beats his
chest with his fists and spurs the stallion over the edge of the terrace
going for Diamond

Will runs as fast as his body will let him - along the rooftop
INSIDE A HOUSE

An ape mother cowers in a corner her two children clutched to her the
sounds of battle all around She looks up in terror -

Smash Wills feet blast through the roof He lands on the floor crossbow
raised -but not st her Framed in the front doorway is an ape warrior on
horseback Wham Will shoots him and runs for the horse

DIAMOND

and Eve fly down charred street They head towards a large open square
OUTSIDE THE STABLES

Smoke and dust swirl through the air The freed prisoners are fighting ape
infantry Drak races past the battle The rope from the harpoon is tied

around the saddle dragging Aragorns body through the dust

He looks ahead - Diamond gallops across the square Drak whips his horse
forward —-

A CURVED ROAD
on a high terrace Flying around a corner - Will His coat is billowing

the horses mane streaming in the wind He hits the straight-away and
gallops even faster
He looks down on the road below - Diamond is ahead but Drak is gaining on
her Will plunges into a tunnelhewn out of rock

ON THE ROAD

Eve clings tight to Diamonds waist The little girl looks back - Drak is
thundering behind them pennants snapping in the wind armor glinting on
the horses chest Its an awesome sight

Drak has the reins in his teeth Hes using both hands to reload the
harpoon

Diamond sees the bridge dead ahead Heavily armed apes have barricaded it
She curses and yanks the bridle The horse sweeps around an island in the
center of the road - a huge monument to some dead ape She gallops back the
way she came almost passing Drak He charges round the island

OUT OF THE TUNNEL

comes Will He looks down to the lower road - Diamond and Drak are coming
back towards him He turns the horse around - back into the tunnel

Whooshl He flies out the other end into daylight He looks over his
shoulder - hes in front of them but thirty feet too high He digs his
heels into the horses flanks -over a Iow wall they fly God knows where it
goes -

DOWN A ROCKY SUDE

into a dead-end cul-de-sac just above the roadway Apesi Two of them are
guarding the Claw and the Bells Will fires from the shoulder - he drops
the first ape

The second ape aims at him Will raises another crossbow They fire almost
simultaneously Will throws himself aside out of the saddle The horse
rears and bolts

Will looks up from the dirt - the ape has Wills arrow embedded in his
chest He falls forward - dead

Will scrambles to a parapet and looks down on the road just below Diamond
and Eve - clinging to the horse for dear life - race towards him Will
grabs a crossbow and struggles to reload He cant - it takes the strength
of both arms to cock it

ON THE ROAD

Diamonds horse is lathered in sweat almost blown Eve looks over her
shoulder her eyes wide with fear - Drak is close behind gaining at every
step

IN THE CUL-DE-SAC

Will leaps from the Balls on to the Claw

ON THE ROAD
Drak swings the harpoon on to his shoulder He sights down the barrel Eve
sees the weapon lock on to their backs She screams a warning et Diamond -

EVE
Billie

Diamond leaps the horse over a charred wagon abandoned on the road Drak
loses her in his sights He follows her over the wagon

ON THE CLAW

Will is in the drivers seat He throws a lever - nothing happens He tries
another -the long jib that supportl the two iron jews swings towards the
road

DRAK

aims the harpoon Hes got Eve end Diamond one behind the other in his
sights

DRAK

A bargain - two for the price of onel
ON THE CLAW

Will spins a small steering wheel

ON THE ROAD

Drak is close behind Diamond The harpoons massive spring is coiled
Draks finger curls around the trigger about to fire

Suddenly he screams - dropping right in front coming straight towards him
are the opening jaws of the Claw

WILL JERKS BACK ANOTHER LEVER -

WILL

Keep your hands off her you dirty ape

The jaws lock clean around Draks waist plucking him off the saddle and
lifting him up into the air Hes still got the harpoon He sees Will at
the control He swings the barrel round -

Will hits a switch Wrong one - nothing happens

Draks got him in his sights His finger finds the trigger -

Will throws another switch

The jaws start to close Drak tries to pull the trigger - he cant his

body is twisting The jaws are crushing him He musters all of his strength
and tries to fire He and Will look straight at one another A beat Drsks
finger starts to slide off the trigger -

IN THE SQUARE

Apes stare up at their warrior lord clamped in the Clew He let out a
blood curdling scream The bottom half of his torso - everything from the
waist down - falls towards the ground Maybe its just the wind but the

legs still seem to be kicking

The apes reel beck in horror With mighty battle cry the tribes-people -
the prisoners end Aregoml followers - hurl themselves forward attacking

The apes break end start to run

ON THE ROAD

Diamond end Eve have dismounted Diamond stumbles forward - Will is coming
towards her She holds out her arms and they embrace Neither one says a
word they just hold each other tight

CLOUDS OF SMOKE

almost obscure the setting sun Will and Diamond stand on the iron bridge
watching the tribes-people Theyve harnessed horses to ropes tied around
the statues on the avenue of idols - one after another the stone monoliths
come crashing down

DIAMOND

If nothing else we helped the tribes take back their valley

WILL

Our valley too Billia

She looks at him - questioning

WILL (CONTD)

Theres one thing I never told you - I never worked out how to get back
She smiles at him

DIAMOND

A small point But give me some credit Im a scientist - I knew that
WILL

(in wonder)

But you came anyway

DIAMOND

That was love
WILL

For the baby

She shakes her head

DIAMOND

For the both of you

They stare into each others eyes They kiss

DIAMOND (CONTD)
I only have one regret Well never know if we succeeded

WILL

Of course we will Youre pregnant - if the babys born alive well know
it worked

SUNLIGHT GLISTENS ON THE OCEAN

The surf rolls in on a golden beach At the waters edge a line of
footprints We follow them to find Will on top of a rocky cliff Hes
building something out of iron and rock and sand but we cant make out what
it is

DIAMOND (0S)
Will

He turns and runs to the mouth of a large cave
INSIDE THE CAVE

Diamond lies on her back on a pile of animal skins Her belly is exposed
heaw with the unborn child Eve crouches next to her trying to help

WILL
Its started

She nods her head then grimaces with pain as another contraction starts
THE SUN IS SETTING ON THE SEA

From inside the cave we hear Diamond scream

IN THE CAVE

Will kneels between Diamonds legs Her face glistening with sweat is a
mask of pain She holdl Eves hind tight and pushes

Will half hidden by her upraised legs delivers the child Diamond raises
herself up -trying to See her child Neither she nor us can see its face

We push in on Will Ha raises his hand and slaps the babys rump No sound
Ha raises his hand again - suddenly the baby starts to cry Now we see the
baby - a perfect little boy
Eve laughs Diamond smiles Tears fill her eyes She and Will look at one
another He comes towards her and tenderly places the baby in her arms

THE CAVE
Will and Eve help Diamond She comes out of the cave still holding the
baby Its magic hour - they stand on a rock ledge looking at the ocean

washed with color from the setting sun

We see what Will was building Its sort of like a sculpture - just the
head and crown of the Statue of Liberty

Diamond smiles She looks at him wondering why -

WILL
Its to make sure we never forget where we came from

The baby starts to cry Will puts one arm each around Diamond and Eve

We pull back from them - high up into the stars The babys cry carries
over We see earth rise In all this nothingness - life
