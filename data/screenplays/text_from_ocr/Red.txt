COMMANDOS in hi-tech body armor night-vision and weaponry
are right there

From a small case the leader takes out a full syringe

The second reaches past him with a snoop scope linked to
his heads up display the hall is clear the door at the
far end swinging closed

They move silently into the hall listening to the WATER
RUN the leader with the syringe the second empty-handed
ready for the take down the third with a machine pistol
The bathroom door stands ajar spilling out bright light

The commandos lift their night-vision as they move down
the hall past the guest room closing in

WHAM They kick in the door revealing
the empty bathroom

as Frank steps out of the darkened guest room behind
them in his robe and bare feet

The three men whip around startled

WHAP The commando closest to Frank goes down

The second swings but his legs are swept from under him
Franks heel crushing his throat as he hits the floor

The leader lunges with the syringe but its twisted out
of his hand and suddenly in his arm plunger pressed

Staring at Frank the commandos eyes flutter and drop

Frank is left standing alone amidst the bodies He isnt
even breathing hard

He crouches down looking them over without emotion

mirror a table and two chairs bolted to the floor

takes a seat across from her and sets it between them

There will be no lawyer No one
is coming There will be no record
of what transpires here

She stares at him

COOPER (contd)
Youre going to tell me what other
agents are involved with Frank
Moses who helped him escape and
what his relationship is to that
government

Cooper puts a satellite photograph on top of Franks file
that shows Frank Marvin Victoria and Ivan by the limo
but if you didnt know an ID would be impossible

COOPER (contd)
If you cooperate fully there may
be a light at the end of the tunnel
Until then there is nothing I can
not do to you Nothing

Sarah shaking slowly starts to cry

COOPER (contd)
Look at the picture

She takes the file with trembling hands and

Swinging as hard as she can she catches Cooper full in
the face with the six-inch-thick file WHAM

He goes down and shes around the table and out the door

where two LARGE GUARDS jump up ready to grab her
Sarah stops realizing its futile

Turning she walks back into the interrogation room where
Coopers regaining his feet

She looks at him icy all traces of false emotion gone

SARAH

The reason other people are involved
is because they have honor and
integrity Stuff you wouldnt
know about

So do what you need to do And
theyll do what they need to do
And at the end of the day well

Cooper smiles

stress or the pay that bothered
me I didnt even realize what it
was until it was too late

Cooper looks at Thomas who whispers

used against you It taught me
never to invest Never to care

good at it

indescribable

to take a stand This is a stain

Stanton stares at Frank in horror
ZAP

CUT TO

INT LIMOUSINE - DRIVING - NIGHT

Stanton slowly comes around in the back seat groaning
His Secret Service Agents are gone

His hands are zip-tied behind his back

Frank glances at him in the rear view mirror

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON

The Vice President looks at him in fear

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON

Stanton senses this is bad

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON

they all just blur together Maybe
you dont even think about it

have that

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON

FRANK

Stanton suddenly looks like hes been gut-punched Like
hes about to be sick

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON

You can talk all you want

Frank slowly pulls over into a deserted lot near an
industrial waterfront area beneath the El tracks

FRANK (contd)
But Im still going to kill you

EXT DESERTED LOT - NIGHT

He gets out of the car opens the rear door and pulls
Stanton out spilling him into the dirt

FRANK
On your knees

The VP crawls up coming apart on the verge of tears

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
I didnt kill anyone
(sobbing)
I tried to stop it

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON (contd)
They pulled me out because my dad
knew it wouldnt matter I was
there

Frank unholsters his old 45 and crouches down to look
the VP in the eye

FRANK
Its not that I want revenge I
dont care about you But there
are rules about how you treat your
tools The people who do things
for you do it because they believe
in the greater good

Frank holds up his set of dog tags Now we see that the
name and number have been filed out

FRANK (contd)
I joined up when I was seventeen
and took an oath to defend this
country They stamped these tags
with the name my mother gave me
Later the Company erased that name
forever These are a symbol of
that sacrifice

A train goes by overhead with a deafening ROAR
Frank levels his gun at the Vice President
FRANK (contd)
Today I am going to restore honor
to your office

Suddenly bright lights pin Frank

COOPER
Freeze

Cooper emerges from a car weapon drawn

COOPER (contd)
Do this youre dead

Frank glances at Cooper then back at the VP as the
POUNDING of a helicopter draws close

FRANK
I guess Im okay with that

He starts to move but Cooper pulls Sarah from the car
covering her with his weapon

She and Frank lock eyes So close but so far

He looks between her and the VP

FRANK (contd)
I love you

SARAH
I love you too

Frank looks at Cooper

FRANK
She goes free

Cooper nods

FRANK (contd)
Swear it on your familys life

COOPER

Sarah looks between them horrified

SARAH
No

Frank slowly lowers his 45

It CLATTERS to the ground

Jackson and Thomas move in on him guns ready

Frank puts his hands above his head and as the chopper
lands kicking up dust over the scene his eyes never
leave Sarahs as hes cuffed

Stevens gets out of the chopper

Approaching Cooper he eyes Frank and the VP

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Thats him

COOPER
Thats him

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Good work

Cooper gives him a nod

COOPER
Yes sir

The VP approaches Stevens still shaking furious

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
What the hell have you done I
asked you to find out who knew
about Afghanistan to see if we
could control the story

Frank watches this trying to figure it out

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Which is exactly what I did I
protected this administration and
made this campaign possible With
the stroke of a pen I gave you a
shot at the presidency

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
You had people killed

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
No one who mattered

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Americans

DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
Nobody cares

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
This isnt what I wanted

Stevens smiles coldly
DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS STEVENS
These arent details you need to
be concerned about All you need
to remember is that you owe me
The VP starts towards him

VICE PRESIDENT STANTON
Is that why you did this

Cooper steps between them stopping the VP
He nods to Jackson and Thomas
COOPER

Escort the Vice President to the

chopper

They pull him away leaving Cooper and Stevens alone with
Frank and Sarah

Cooper takes out a syringe

SARAH
No

Cooper steps to Frank who stares him down unflinching
Lashing out Cooper jabs it into Stevens neck
He gasps eyes bugging

COOPER
You disgust me

Clutching his chest Stevens collapses to the ground
Sarah looks away But Franks eyes never leave Cooper
Uncuffing Frank Cooper holds out his 45
FRANK
Maybe theres some hope for the

Company after all

COOPER
Maybe

Frank takes the gun
Sarah leaps into Franks arms and they embrace

COOPER (contd)
I want you to come back home

FRANK

COOPER
A chance to work again To train
the next generation

Frank considers then tosses Cooper his tags and takes
Sarahs hand

FRANK
Im retired

Cooper watches them walk away
COOPER
Where are you going to go Frank
What else do you have

But suddenly a figure steps out of the darkness to meet
Frank Marvin carrying a RPG

And then another figure emerges Victoria rifle slung

A car starts in the darkness and pulls close Ivans behind
the wheel still dressed in his tux

Frank and Sarah embrace their friends

Frank looks back at Cooper then slips into the car and
is gone
