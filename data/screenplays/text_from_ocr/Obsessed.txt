coming from individual investors which is
why its gaining mainstream acceptance

anything goes mainstream He started
making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I
managed to talk him into a private equity
portfolio instead to the tune of 155

LISA
Why dont they invite spouses

DEREK

LISA
To the Christmas party It says for
employees only

DEREK
Its like that in most companies They
think people are more inhibited in front
of their spouses less likely to kick
back and enjoy themselves and mingle with
co-workers which is what the party is
about

LISA
So does this party get pretty wild

DEREK
Just the opposite

LISA
Well thats no fun

Derek notices a container of Starbucks coffee

crotch Derek whirls around face to face with a brazen
smiling Lisa who dangles a sprig of Mistletoe in her free
hand Her eyes flash with desire

In the stall Lisa and Derek are face to face His hand
grabs her wrist as she squeezes his crotch He tries to
remove it but her grip is like a vice

control and enjoying this turned on by the thrill of
getting

gleaming with passion

The Drunk continues his piss Endless Finally finished
He clumsily zips back up lurches over to the sink He looks

card He slides it and pushes open the door

INT HOTEL ROOM

Derek lets himself in doesnt even click on the lights
Theres enough moonlight coming through the window to lead
him to the bed where he flops down on his back He doesnt
even bother to undress

Derek closes his eyes then opens them He feels sick
Sound and perception are playing games with his head The
room begins to spin and he can hear a sound a rushing

noise
Is it the shower in the bathroom The bathroom door is shut
but theres a crack of light around the edges Is someone in
there

Derek is too out of it to care He just wants to sleep make
it go away He closes his eyes begins to drift off

The bathroom door opens letting in a cloud of steam and a
shaft of light A womans silhouette appears naked She

moves to the bed

D
erek feels the bed move feels a tug on his trousers
then an amplified ZZZZIIIPPP

Dereks eyes open in shock He cant believe what he sees --
Lisa naked straddling him Her hand caressing his face
Its like a dream A nightmare Lisa smiles seductively and
puts a finger to her lips

LISA
Hush baby

Her voice seems distorted like its coming from another
world

LISA (contd)

Derek tries to resist but finds he has no control over his
body or mind All he can see is a shifting distorted image
of Lisas face her smile her teeth her lips the
blazing look of sexual desire in her eyes And somewhere in
those eyes he can see HIMSELF

And thats the last thing Derek sees before he passes out

and

the entire world goes black and silent Cc

INTERCUTTING DEREK IN THE OFFICE
Reacting in surprise and panic

DEREK

Before she can answer Beth is suddenly there She rips the
phone from Lisas hand and strikes her with it As Lisa

stumbles back into the hall landing Beth speaks calmly

sweetly into the receiver
BETH
Derek Im right in the middle of
something let me call you back

DEREK
Beth --

Beth hangs up the phone

T

Alarmed Derek hurries out of the office punching a number
into his cell as he runs to the elevator A nervous Patrick
watches Derek exit

EREK (contd)
I need to speak to Lt Reyes Its an
emergency

Beth goes out into the hall and Lisa springs on her

he two women fight going up against the bannister They

claw and punch at each other With renewed strength Lisa
forces Beth up against the bannister Beth looks over the
side and down

Fifteen feet below is that large glass dining table

Lisa bangs Beth against the bannister A few feet away is a
heavy crystal chandelier suspended from the ceiling by a
metal chain

T

he bannister rail begins to crack Lisa tries to force Beth
over then Beth suddenly swings them around reversing
positions --
The bannister cracks breaks apart and Lisa topples over the
side

As shes about to fall Lisa reaches out and grabs the
chandelier with both hands

By a miracle it supports her and she swings back and forth

like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to
pull loose from its ceiling mount Plaster cracks and rips

away

Lisa swings back and forth dangling

Beth stands on the landing She looks at terrified Lisa
then up at the ceiling mount It wont take Lisas weight
much longer

And both women know it

Lisa hangs by one hand reaching out with her other hand to
Beth who could pull her to safety

LISA
Please

Beth considers Then as if coming out of dream she slowly
reaches out to Lisa Their hands lock together Beth slowly
pulls Lisa toward her toward safety

L

BETH
(quiet voice)
Let go of the chandelier

LISA
(AFRAID)
No

BETH
Let go Lisa

he chandelier is about to break loose
B
ETH (contd)
(motherly concern)
Listen to me You have to let go right
now

And trusting Lisa lets go
But so does Beth

With a look of horror on her face Lisa falls through space
The soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion

Down down down Lisa falls Her arms and legs flop around
like a marionette with its strings cut clawing the air

fq

The fall seems endless

Then Lisa hits the glass dining table with her back

whole body buckles The surface of the table ripples

n slow mo the glass shatters and explodes around Lisa
framing her entire body forming a halo around her head
Sound returns -- the sound of breaking glass -- and its
deafening

The table gives way and Lisa lands hard on the marble floor
her skull cracking Her back is probably broken but shes

still conscious

ying there Lisa stares up at Beth on the landing as glass
bounces and TINKLES around her

The two enemies lock eyes Beths face is impassive
Lisa opens her mouth trying to speak

And thats when the chandelier breaks loose

Beth watches without emotion as the chandelier plunges
downward and hits Lisa in the chest with a radiantly
beautiful shower of crystals It kills her on impact
WwW
e come out of slow motion Real time resumes
On the landing Beth stares down at Lisas body splayed
under the chandelier like a broken doll Lisas eyes are
open but theyre dead
Beth stoic just stands there looking down
