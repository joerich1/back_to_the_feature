EXT GARDENS ALTHORP - DAY
TITLE Althorp Estate 1774

Two servants knock in four flag posts with fifty paces in
between They are marking out a race track of some kind

Were on the back lawn of a beautiful country house Off in
the distance are fields filled with sheep long grass and
trees It’s a perfect summer’s day with birds singing and a
gentle breeze rustling in leaves

Six ARISTOCRATIC YOUNG MEN stand in a group on the field
They are preparing for a running race taking their jackets
off and laying them down then rolling up their sleeves

On the lawn a similar sized group of ARISTOCRATIC YOUNG
WOMEN stand across from them Behind is a tent and a table
with the remains of an outdoor picnic

To one side of the women a young beautiful and content
GEORGIANA approaches with a hat Inside are folded up
pieces of paper which she mixes around She offers the hat
to the women and they each pick a piece of paper One after
another they read out the names of the men opposite who
look over and smile GEORGIANA is left with the last name
and looks up

GEORGIANA
(Loud1ly )
Youd better not let me down
Charles Grey I’ve got twenty
guineas riding on you

A young man CHARLES GREY looks back He is quick to reply

GREY
Only twenty I’d double that if I
were you

GEORGIANA smiles while the look on Grey’s face suggests
that he’s taking this very seriously He joins the other
men in the starting line up who also seem pretty intent on
winning

GEORGIANA
Are you ready gentlemen Twice
around the track On my count
threetwoonego

GEORGIANA drops a handkerchief The men immediately sprint
out across the park The women start to cheer GEORGIANA
shouts the loudest then starts to jump up and down

INT ALTHORP - DAY

In CLOSE UP a quill pen dips into an ink well and starts
to write on a virgin piece of white paper ‘The Fourteenth
Day of May Seventeen Hundred and Seventy Four’

HEATON a solicitor is at a table writing this document
his ink pen scraping against the paper Around him the
room has the atmosphere of a serious occasion still and
dark although the sun shines brightly outside and the
voices of the women - especially GEORGIANA - bleed through

The DUKE HEATON’s employer is standing at the library
window looking into the garden at GEORGIANA cheering on
the young men The scene is distorted through the wavy

glass window pane a beautiful and mildly surreal image

LADY SPENCER is seated behind the DUKE perched on the edge
of a large sofa with LORD SPENCER behind her She tries to
ignore the muted screams of her daughter in the background

LADY SPENCER
(Cautiously)
I trust your Grace still finds
Georgiana an attractive girl

The DUKE turns and we now see his face properly He is
handsome older than GEORGIANA and has a rakish twinkle in
his eye He looks at LADY SPENCER enigmatically

DUKE
Of course Lady Spencer

Another of GEORGIANA’s shouts audibly registers LADY
SPENCER starts to pour tea from a silver Samovar in front
of her in an effort to drown out the noise

LADY SPENCER
She is well-bred and devoted to
her duties She speaks French
Latin and Italian and is fully
versed in horsemanship and
dancing

DUKE
Yes I am aware of all that She
is a credit to you
THE DUCHESS SHOOTING SCRIPT - PURPLE REVISIONS - 20112007 3

LADY SPENCER
--I cant think of anything in
her that would stand in the way
of a singularly happy marriage -

The DUKE turns for a brief moment and smiles inscrutably at
LADY SPENCER HEATON cuts to the chase

HEATON
These are not the issues that
burden the Duke Lady Spencer It
is His Grace’s duty to produce an
heir On the other hand your
daughter may expect a handsome
reward when that occurs -

DUKE
Thank you Heaton

BURLEIGH
(resuming his writing)
Your Grace

The DUKE remains looking out of the window not so much out
of interest in GEORGIANA but rather because he finds these
pre-nuptial proceedings uncomfortable LADY SPENCER throws
a brief glance at LORD SPENCER who seems disinclined to
discuss these matters She resolutely turns to the DUKE

LADY SPENCER
Your Grace can rest assured The
women in our family have never
forfeited on that account

LADY SPENCER smiles at her husband who nods back HEATON
looks to the DUKE for confirmation then decides to address
his comment to no one in particular

HEATON
Well with that assurance

HEATON turns the document around toward the others for them
to look at The DUKE smiles at them then turns and
fastidiously removes a spot on the window pane

DUKE
So be it then

GEORGIANA
Come on Grey

GREY puts his head down and accelerates He wins totally
out of breath and sweating All the others follow
similarly exhausted and bent over double

GEORGIANA turns to the other women a book containing all
the bets they’ve laid in her hand

GEORGIANA (CONTD)
(Charming smile)
I do apologise ladies but it
appears my horse has won

The young women smile and gather around GEORGIANA GREY
approaches from behind still slightly out of breath manly
and athletic GEORGIANA turns to him

GEORGIANA (CONTD)
Well done Mr Grey

He looks intensely at her bravely standing much closer
than may normally be expected Some of the young people
notice this and there’s an edge of tension at this risque
behaviour

GREY
(Flirtatiously)
And my reward

GEORGIANA returns the look

GEORGIANA
What would you suggest

The young people - eavesdropping on this conversation -
smile and look at each other GREY is just about to come
back with a reply when

SERVANT

SPENCER reveals nothing holding in her secret but her
excitement can’t help but shine through

LADY SPENCER pauses for dramatic effect

GEORGIANA
Yes

GEORGIANA is taken wholly by surprise

GEORGIANA
Is it true Mama

LADY SPENCER
(Proudly)
It is

GEORGIANA

LADY SPENCER
I had hoped not to part with you
until 18 at the soonest but with
such a fine match it would be
selfish of me not to let you go

GEORGIANA
He loves me

LADY SPENCER
Yes of course

GEORGIANA
(Excited)
I have met him only twice

Inside the huge courtyard Devonshire House is revealed as
an oversized stark and austere building A wall runs all
the way around it blocking the view and completes the
foreboding sense of arriving in a prison The FOOTMAN opens

GEORGIANA steps out into this hugely intimidating space
Flags bearing the Duke’s crest blow in the wind making a
tense and aggressive sound She stops a moment to take it

THE DUKE
You’re in safe hands

His attempt to reassure her only serves to unnerve GEORGIANA
more She remains standing and looks up at the ceiling while
the DUKE expertly unlaces her corset

THE DUKE (CONTD)
For the life of me I dont
understand why womens attire
must be so damned complicated

GEORGIANA
I suppose its just our way of
expressing ourselves

THE DUKE
Whatever do you mean

GEORGIANA
Well that you have so many ways
of expressing yourselves whereas
we must make do with our hats and
our dresses I suppose

THE DUKE
Hmmm

The corset falls to the floor The DUKE then removes
GEORGIANA’S chemise Suddenly she is completely naked She
sends the DUKE an uneasy look For a moment he appears to
be lost in his thoughts just staring at her

GEORGIANA
Is something the matter

THE DUKE
No not in the least Go to the
bed please

GEORGIANA goes to the bed The DUKE starts to undress
Around him the faces of his forefathers bear down from the
massive portraits on the walls of his bedroom

seem

GEORGIANA
Yes but when we are together
intimately I mean he

LADY SPENCER
I know it can be a bother
However it is only until you
have given him a son The
occasions will then become fewer
and lessdetermined

Lady Spencer places down a card

GEORGIANA
I think it would feel different if
he might talk to me every once in a
while It’s not that he’s unkind
but he never talks to me

LADY SPENCER
Well perhaps you ought to talk
less I fear I may have given you
a little too much education You
make tiring conversation and ask
questions which a man is
disinclined to answer

GEORGIANA looks at her mother in resignation How can anyone
have too much education

LADY SPENCER (CONTD)
Learning these things takes time
too Marriage is just like
languages or music or painting It
requires a long apprenticeship

GEORGIANA
Yes But he is he is not at all
as when I first met him I thought
he would be like Papa Under his
cool reserve I would find a wealth
of depth and sentiment But he
doesn’t seem interested in
anything Apart from his dogs

LADY SPENCER
Try not to be too hard on His
Grace G He is merely intent on
fulfilling his duty As for talking
to him - whatever is there to talk
about my dear

GEORGIANA
No youre right How foolish of me
to think that I should be able to
converse with my husband

LADY SPENCER sighs and looks at her spirited daughter

INT DEVONSHIRE HOUSE - BALLROOM - NIGHT 15

A great noisy dinner party WHIGS in full gala among
which is CHARLES FOX a stout little man making a speech in
the grand room Everybody listens to him HEATON watches on
from the side

GEORGIANA is by his side her attire conspicuously more
daring than before She looks apprehensive she is the only
woman in a room dominated by alcohol and testosterone-
fuelled MEN one of whom is relieving himself into a
chamber pot at the side of the room GEORGIANA though
pays attention to FOX The DUKE at the other end of the
table does not

FOX
-a political party in my
definition consists of men of
honour entertaining similar
principles that may be more
successfully pursued by the force
of mutual support and not to
forget the unfailing generosity of
his Grace the Duke of Devonshire

Everybody looks to the DUKE applauding loudly and somewhat
sycophantically The DUKE nods cordially

FOX (CONTD)
So between the persistence of my
own humble self

Everybody laughs again including GEORGIANA thus betraying
that nobody finds Fox humble FOX pleased with the success
of his joke joins in the laughter

FOX (CONTD)
I say between my persistence and
the Dukes purse we must always
remember the honourable and
principle aims of the Whig party
aims that some consider radical
but which to us seem simply
just and right and sensible

(MORE)
THE DUCHESS SHOOTING SCRIPT - PURPLE REVISIONS - 20112007 13

FOX (CONTD)
Just to bring independence to
America Right to end the slave
trade And sensible to pursue
freedom for the common man so
that the blessings of this
blessed plot this England may
be more equally enjoyed - by all
of its inhabitants

All these are greeted by ‘hear hears’ from the room and a
deep thoughtfulness from GEORGIANA

FOX (CONTD)
And so - having kept everyone
from the burgundy long enough -
let me propose a toast to our
host and benefactor his Grace
the Duke and his beautiful new
Duchess

They all shout hear hear reach for their glasses and
toast in the direction of the DUKE He nods cordially back

FOX sits down at GEORGIANAs side The murmur of small talk
rises as the guests carry on with their eating and drinking
A MACARONI on the other side of FOX compliments his speech

MACARONI
Excellent speech Mr Fox
splendid

FOX

I thank you However it is always
easy to address a congregation of
friends and even more so when
those friends are drunk

The MACARONI and GEORGIANA smile

MACARONI
How did the Duchess find Mr Foxs
speech

GEORGIANA

I must confess I am not yet at ease
with political speeches Their very
form tends to obstruct my view to
their actual meaning - if such
there be

FOX expecting inane flattery is surprised although
favourably impressed by GEORGIANAs candour The MACARONI
not observing that GEORGIANA has earned FOXs undivided
attention proceeds to think that he is still part of the
conversation
THE DUCHESS SHOOTING SCRIPT - PURPLE REVISIONS - 20112007 14

MACARONI
(Ingratiatingly)
I myself found it very rousing

FOX ignores him He knows who he wants to talk to

FOX
In which particular section of
the speech did the message elude
your Grace

GEORGIANA
Well I have great sympathy with
your sentiments in general but
fail fully to comprehend how far we
- the Whig party that is - are
fully committed to the concept of

freedom

FOX
We would like to see the vote
extended

GEORGIANA

To all men

FOX
Heavens no But certainly to more
men Freedom in moderation

GEORGIANA
Freedom in moderation

FOX
(Pleased with himself)
Precisely

GEORGIANA nods then smiles faintly but mischievously

GEORGIANA
I am sure you are full of the
best intentions Mr Fox but I
dare say I would not spend my
vote - assuming I had it - on so
vague a statement Either one is
free or one is not The concept
of freedom is an absolute After
all one cannot be moderately
dead moderately loved or
moderately free It must always
remain a matter of either or

Fox smiles at GEORGIANA in surprise
THE DUCHESS SHOOTING SCRIPT - PURPLE REVISIONS - 20112007 15

GEORGIANA (CONTD)
(Cheeky )
It is no wonder you are having
such problems at the ballot box

GEORGIANA smiles winningly Fox scrutinizes her face not
a little shocked but clearly impressed

Another well-dressed MAN taps his glass and rises to speak
The room falls silent

MAN
I think its appropriate to say a
few words

The DUKE seems in no mood for another speech and resolutely
gets up and leaves The entire company including the MAN
about to make a speech look bewildered at one another

GEORGIANA too is surprised and doesn’t really know what
she should do so she stands too and goes after the DUKE

GEORGIANA
The Duke is fine He simply wants
to rest a while

People don’t look convinced

FOX
Was it the length of the speech
that got the better of the Duke

GEORGIANA
(To the room)
Certainly not He enjoyed it
immensely and expressed a hope that
next time it would be even longer

to her She smiles back at them all reaches out for a drink

staying with us

GEORGIANA looks at the little girl who remains absolutely
still Then she looks at the DUKE

GEORGIANA
Why

The DUKE signals to the BUTLER that they can leave the room
upon which the BUTLER leads the NANNY and Charlotte out

THE DUKE
Because her mother is dead She has
no other place to go

GEORGIANA looks in disbelief at the DUKE The penny drops

GEORGIANA
Have you fathered that child

THE DUKE
Its only a little girl Georgiana
hardly the end of the world

The DUKE sends a suspicious look at the mutton before him He
looks up again only to find that GEORGIANA is still staring
at him He takes a tiny bite of the mutton examining its
taste as if he suspected poison during which he continues

GEORGIANA
I am pregnant with your child
Surely you are not expecting me
to look after her

We have a house full of vacant
rooms G She need not trouble you
As a matter of fact she may even
be of use you can practice your
motherhood on her

LADY SPENCER stops as the DUKE waves her away in a gesture
which roughly signals that the DUKE appreciates her efforts
to comfort him but is too troubled to talk LADY SPENCER
smiles politely and leaves

mother Then her mind shifts and her expression becomes
darker There is an edge to her tone

GEORGIANA
Did William receive you

LADY SPENCER
Yes

GEORGIANA
Was he upset that it wasnt a
son He just glanced at her
briefly and left I’ve hardly
seen him since

LADY SPENCER
Its been a difficult time for

keen to change the subject

It is always a delight when one

further ado it is a great honour
to hand over to our most
distinguished guest

We see the faces of the DUKE and GEORGIANA standing in the
darkness of the wings behind HARE Who is he referring to

When she appears every eye is
turned towards her when absent
she is the subject of universal
conversation and what we see her
wearing tonight I look forward
to seeing the rest of you wearing

JAMES HARE (CONTD)

The CROWD applaud loudly GEORGIANA enters accompanied by
the DUKE There’s a hushed ‘wow’ as everyone takes in her
extraordinary appearance she wears a HUGE THREE FOOT
ADORNED WIG with OSTRICH FEATHERS inserted into it She beams
at the crowd the total centre of attention The DUKE looks
uncomfortable next to her

GEORGIANA

HIGH TEMPO MUSIC is being played by some MUSICIANS Many
people are dancing energetically on the floor - especially
GEORGIANA who is in the middle of a group of admirers on a
high and basking in the attention

GEORGIANA is an expert dancer moving from one male partner
to the next The CAMERA follows the feather on her head
standing high over everyone as she twirls around the room
like a sharks fin jutting out above the water line

All eyes are upon her COURT REPORTERS in the corner try to
sketch it men look on from the sides with barely disguised
sexual interest women look at her dress the feather and
then their husbands’ reactions

The DUKE however stands at the side pretending only to
be half-watching GEORGIANA is spurred on by his
indifference and as the dancing progresses she begins to
show off and flirt in inverse proportion to it

GEORGIANA then loses herself in the dancing untilShe
glances up to see the DUKE talking to another prey - a
beautiful young woman in a dark dress BESS FOSTER

GEORGIANA now sees BESS evidently rejecting the ducal
overtures and leaving the room Rejection is a new experience
for the DUKE and he is appropriately taken aback as is

reminded of that If only for this
evening

The DUKE performs his duty talking with the important
people in the tent other aristocrats politicians and
wealthy businessmen FOX SHERIDAN and GREY are here too

GEORGIANA is opposite amongst the ORDINARY PEOPLE where
she is carrying food to their tables and making sure they
are being well looked after

GREY (0S)
What a fine spread

GEORGIANA turns to see GREY behind her coming over from
the tent

GEORGIANA
Thank you We do our best

GEORGIANA starts to walk through the tables with a plate of
food He follows

GREY
We From what I hear you run
these open days single-handedly

GEORGIANA
Well the Duke does find inviting
all and sundry to the house a
little testing But it’s only
once a week

GREY
The Duke would prefer his tenants
to starve

GEORGIANA
It is his property

GREY
Then he must surely embrace the
responsibilities that come with it
Or perhaps His Grace would prefer
instead to be divested of such
troublesome possessions

GEORGIANA
(Provocatively)
What an interesting idea
THE DUCHESS SHOOTING SCRIPT - PURPLE REVISIONS - 20112007 47

GREY encouraged by her double meaning continues

GREY
You know I despise the fact that
so few men can have such precious
things - and that they mismanage
them so appallingly

GEORGIANA smiles at him She knows he is talking about her

GEORGIANA
And what would you suggest

He returns her smile remembering the exchange from years
ago

GREY
That people should be set free
GEORGIANA
And will freedom alone make them
happy
GREY

The point is not to make people
happy The point is to make them
free so they can pursue their
own idea of happinesswhatever
that may be

GEORGIANA looks impressed She realizes how close theyre
standing and in full view of the PEOPLE She moves away a
few feet

GEORGIANA
I must get another plate

GEORGIANA walks off GREY watches her go happy in the
knowledge he has made an impact He starts back toward FOX

Your behaviour is so out of the
ordinary

very best of women

LADY SPENCER

were that

GEORGIANA
It may pain you to recognise it
Mama but a great change has come
over my life and its name is Lady
Elizabeth Fosterabout whom it
can be truly said I have at long
last found my other self

LADY SPENCER’s pulse races She wants to interject

GEORGIANA (CONTD)
I understand if that may make you
feel a little jealous

LADY SPENCER stops

LADY SPENCER
(Fierce whisper)
This is a dangerous path to
choose my girl

GEORGIANA
I am not a girl mother I am the
Duchess of Devonshire It would
serve you well to remember that
THE DUCHESS SHOOTING SCRIPT - PURPLE REVISIONS - 20112007 48A

LADY SPENCER
Yes and you have begun to cavort
so constantly in public you
cannot live for your own soul It
is no surprise you are gathering
weeds instead of flowers

GREY
Terribly Our only hope is to

I give you a man who will inform
us of the work we must do and the
party we so believe in Mister
Charles Grey

APPLAUSE as GREY moves to take the stage GEORGIANA and
GREY exchange a look as he positions himself

GREY
I am here in Westminster to speak
on behalf of our candidate Sir
Charles James Fox

APPLAUSE

GREY (CONTD)
Well I wish only to address a
single issue Power

GEORGIANA looks at GREY clearly proud of him

GREY (CONTD)
The basis of power in our country
is land as it has been for
centuries And the aristocracy
owns nearly all of it

There are a few laughs from the CROWD

GREY (CONTD)
-along with all the places in
the Government control of the
House of Commons Ambassadors
Governors Judges and a host of
other posts too numerous to
mention They maintain this
influence by transferring their
land intact generation after
generation And in so doing
continue to dominate English
life

GREY stops to look at the faces of the PUBLIC looking back
at him They are with him

GREY (CONTD)
So if we win this election if we
get the power we seek what will we
do with it

GREY’s listeners are quiet GREY proceeds
THE DUCHESS SHOOTING SCRIPT - PURPLE REVISIONS - 20112007

GREY (CONTD)

Will we merely follow in the
footsteps of those that came before
us Master the art of compromise
Of postponing the greater good for
the greater advantage Will we do
that

(Long pause)
No We won’t Because we believe
in the words weve spoken

A few scattered ‘hear hears’ begin

GREY (CONTD)
and we have faith in the hearts
weve stirred

More ‘HEAR HEARS’ GREY’s rhetoric takes flight

GREY (CONTD)
The world is on the brink of
disaster or salvation From
France to America men and women
are struggling to free themselves
and find meaning in their
existence Change is upon us

Loud calls of ‘YES’ and applause

GREY (CONTD)
We shall not return to the old
ways We shall not shirk our
promises and our duties We shall
take England into this brave new
world and shake the thunder from
the skies This we vow

GEORGIANA (CONTD)
It was a marvel

GREY smiles A big open boyish smile of relief

GREY
But did you agree with what I said

GEORGIANA
Every word

GREY gains self-confidence He approaches GEORGIANA

GREY
I was nervous Your presence
trebled the numbers at least

GREY is now very close indeed GEORGIANA feels the effect
of it She becomes short of breath GREY speaks softly

GREY (CONTD)
I am nervous even now

GEORGIANA knows that she ought to keep a distance but
remains where she is

GEORGIANA
So am I

There is tension in the air A POLITICIAN walks past them
They both acknowledge him as he goes Then GEORGIANA stares
at GREY and moves a little closer

GEORGIANA (CONTD)
Do you think of me when we are
not together

GREY
(surprised)
You ought to know I do of you
more than anything else

GEORGIANA
You hesitated before replying

GREY
I am unused to being asked so
directly and by you of all
people

GREY walks close He very gently puts his hand on hers She
looks down at his hand then up at him blushing a little

society

now looks uglier and sordid a place of corruption and
addiction on the edge of collapse

GEORGIANA yields to her old friend Amid the rest of the

face is hardened distant - a vision of suppressed anger
frustration and pain She closes her eyes her mind
drifting to thoughts of GREY

GEORGIANA grabs another drink as they pass a SERVANT She
bumps into SHERIDAN Drink goes on his jacket

SHERIDAN

bear my children and I dont
care if they are boys or girls

But GEORGIANA is barely holding it together

GEORGIANA
I wish it could be like that

GREY
It can It will Sorrows come
however we try to avoid them We
must stay our course and not give
in

GEORGIANA
(Firmly)
No Charles

GREY steps forward to take her arm but GEORGIANA backs
away BURLEIGH makes as if to intervene but holds back

GREY
You must leave and be with me a
free woman Now let us leave
now It is still possible Let us
at least take a chance

GEORGIANA
I cannot risk my children

GREY stares at her with wide angry tortured eyes

GEORGIANA (CONTD)
This is a sacrifice I am forced
to makebut I have given you up
for them only And in so doing I
have lost my heart and soul

GREY looks at her sad and weak nothing left to argue
GEORGIANA stands firm She gestures to BURLEIGH

You promised me

GEORGIANA does not respond but keeps staring into the air
BESS takes a deep breath

It will be like this you will be
taken to the country where you
will give birth to the child and
the child will subsequently be
trusted to the care of Charles
Grey’s family

GEORGIANA makes no reply

BESS (CONTD)
Are you listening to me

GEORGIANA slides silently into a reclining position

DUKE
I think she has heard you Lets
leave her

BESS
Georgiana please -

DUKE

a discussion She has been
informed of my decision

BESS looks at GEORGIANA

BESS
Have pity on her William

DUKE
Pity be damned She brought this
upon herself as well you know
Now come

The DUKE starts to go out BESS’s voice stops him

BESS
No I will go with her

DUKE
You’re not going anywhere

BESS
(Turns magnificently)
I will go with G if G will have
me and there is nothing you can
say or do to stop either of us

GEORGIANA flinches - it’s the moment she’s been dreading
BESS comes closer and gestures toward the BABY

It is a barren and featureless landscape with one straight
dirt track running through it TWO DARK COACHES are already
parked ahead GEORGIANA’s COACH containing GEORGIANA and
BESS pulls up fifty yards behind it

At the first of the DARK COACHES a BUTLER stands to one
side a WET NURSE to the other From the second steps a
serious looking older man GENERAL GREY CHARLES GREY is
nowhere to be seen

BESS looks on from the side of their COACH as GEORGIANA
slowly takes the BABY up the track holding it tight to her
all the way

GENERAL GREY
(Flatly)
Your Grace I am General Grey

GEORGIANA
Where is Charles

GENERAL GREY
Your husband thought it best if I
took care of this

GEORGIANA takes a deep breath She hadn’t expected this
and now she is being asked to hand her baby over to a
stranger and a seemingly cold one at that It’s not clear
that she will go through with it
THE DUCHESS SHOOTING SCRIPT - PURPLE REVISIONS - 20112007 97A

GEORGIANA gently kisses the baby’s head whispering to her
smelling her hair her skin running her nose down her face
and breathing her in for one last time BESS finds this
impossible to watch and turns away

With immense difficulty GEORGIANA finally goes to hand her
baby over GENERAL GREY does not take it He nods sharply
to his WET NURSE who steps forward to take the BABY
although for a moment GEORGIANA simply can’t let her go

GENERAL GREY immediately turns to go back to the COACH
GEORGIANA calls after him

GEORGIANA
General Grey

GENERAL GREY stops and turns

GEORGIANA (CONTD)
-her name is Eliza

GENERAL GREY looks at GEORGIANA giving nothing away He
turns and goes back into his COACH followed by the BUTLER
and the WET NURSE and GEORGIANA’S BABY GIRL into theirs

As the BABY GIRL is passed into the coach GEORGIANA can
hear her daughter begin to cry a little GEORGIANA
instinctively flinches using all her strength to hold her
back from running over to comfort her

The driver cracks the whip and GEORGIANA watches as the
DARK COACHES ride off leaving her alone with the barren
landscape behind She slowly sinks down onto the wet and
muddy ground BESS comes forward and holds her

fingers It feels as if she has been sat there all night

BESS enters and comes close It takes a moment for
GEORGIANA to notice she’s even there BESS produces two
linen FLANNELS GEORGIANA looks quizzically at them

BESS
(Gently)
For your milk

GEORGIANA looks down - there are two wet patches on her
breasts BESS kneels next to GEORGIANA and holds tight onto

GEORGIANA is unable to connect for a split second
CHARLOTTE remains looking at her GEORGIANA comes to and is
about to say yes but sees the DUKE approaching from behind

CHARLOTTE gives a small smile and leaves

DUKE
Hello G

GEORGIANA

The DUKE fidgets and unusually for him looks warmly at G

I am not particularly adept at
expressing myself when it comes
to matters of a more personal
nature but I shall endeavour to
try Beat Over the years I have
acted in ways that you have
judged harsh Well I do not
wish for you to undergo any
further suffering Indeed I
would like our life to return to
a calm normality

GEORGIANA
Thank you William

The DUKE looks relieved He smiles

DUKE
Lady Melbourne has arranged a
small gathering in honour of your
recent return from holiday Given
some of the vague reports that
have been circulating over this
past year I think it would be
wise for us to go A show of
unity so to speak

DUKE
Everybody

GEORGIANA recognises what this must mean

GEORGIANA
As you wish

The DUKE turns back to the window We see what he sees
BESS is playing with all their children in the garden the
image distorted by the wavy glass of the window pane It is
a mirrored moment from his opening scene where he watched
the young people dancing his thoughts then a mystery

The DUKE resumes his faraway look and says as if from
nowhere

DUKE
How wonderful to be that free

GEORGIANA looks at him sympathetically as if for the first
time she finally understands this trapped and complex man

and leaves disappearing off into the long corridor

The doors swing open

GEORGIANA steps back into the limelight

She’s looks stylish but in a mature demure way

A subtle hush descends on the gathering as the GUESTS
around them look over with bated breath sensing the whiff
of scandal The tension in the room is palpable

GEORGIANA’s is nervous and it is unclear whether she will
give way to her emotions or manage to keep her composure
GREY too is awkward but summons up the strength to act for
the crowd

GREY (CONTD)
I trust your tour was agreeable

GEORGIANA understands what he is doing and reciprocates

GEORGIANA
Yes thank you We passed the
summer in Switzerland and the
winter in Nice
