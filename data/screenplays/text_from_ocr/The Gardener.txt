SUNRISE LOS ANGELES

We see the nodes of a life-cycle begin their daily pulse

EXT BUS STOP -- EAST LA

On an unglamorous street lined with Mexican produce stores
restaurants general stores 99 cent storesa flock of
women gathers Mostly middle-aged mostly dressed in
uniform

EXT CORNER -- EAST LA

A PICKUP with ply-board wooden sides added to retain the
branches and leaves to come A man in the BACK reaches his
hand out to pull up another who has been waiting on the
corner yawning

CUT TO

EXT BUS STOP - SUNSET BOULEVARD BEL AIR - MORNING

Later in the morning a BUS stops disgorging the nurses and
housekeepers onto a different scene entirely -- high green
hedges hide an entirely different world clean green
festooned with bougainvillea scarred only by the bus-stop
there for exactly this purpose - ferrying the Mexican workers
to their jobs They shoulder their bags and their purses and
start the walk all the rest of the way to wherever it is
they are going

EXT STONE CANYON ROAD - DAY

A lush road in Bel Air the houses hundreds of feet apart and
hidden by hedges fences electronic gates We see a young-
ish maid on her long way up the slight incline coming
towards us a nanny pushing a stroller on a morning walk

The child is of course not hers but she rattles away to it
in Spanish nonetheless not at a loss for love or attention

The truck we saw earlier passes by and the men in it hoot
their appreciation of her slow to offer her a ride which
she waves off not without good humor

CUT TO

EXT THE PRIVATE GROUNDS - DAY

of a Mediterranean-style villa Glorious mid-day sunshine
Sparrows tweeting in the bougainvilleas A fresh-water
swimming pool A jasmined-entwined arbor A bronze by Henry
Moore reposed on the green lawn like some benign monster
sunning itself
Suddenly we see FROND AFTER FROND of palm falling to the
ground beginning to pile up and obscure the statue

WE LOOK UP TO SEE -- AN ILLEGAL MEXICAN GARDENER

Strapped in to the tree at a vertiginous height He hacks
away at fronds and tosses them behind him We don’t see his
face

ANGLE ON THE MEXICAN GARDENER

at the far end of the property digging into the earth with a
shovel We don’t see his face yet Just the motions of his
labor He’s almost like a machine

TIME CUT

The still faceless gardener is now pushing a wheelbarrow
laden with a 6ft tree over the freshly dug hole He lowers
the tree into the hole Then drops to his knees -- and with
his hands -- lovingly covers the roots with soil

PULL BACK TO REVEAL That the gardener has in fact planted 8
identical trees All in a perfect row to wall out the scrubby
hills beyond the estate’s property line

CLOSE ON THE GARDENER’S FACE as he stands to inspect his
day’s work He’s around 40 years-old a simple decent self-
contained man (a little sad perhaps) who understands his
station in life and has no desire to transcend it When he
was younger upon arriving here in this country he brought
with him many dreams But those dreams -- for whatever

reason -- never materialized And now all he wants to do is
work Work and not get deported OS someone calls his
name

MALE VOICE (0S)
Carlos vamonos

Carlos Riquelme grabs the wheelbarrow and pushes it towards
the voice Then we crane up high above the villa to see a
EXT PANORAMA OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES
12 miles in the distance a cluster of skyscrapers swaddled
in smog and surrounded by the most densely-populated urban
sprawl in America

FADE IN ON

EXT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

A poor house in a shabby gang-ridden section of East Los

Angeles

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Carlos Riquelme sleeps on his living room couch under a
flannel blanket It’s very quiet and still

In the distance a siren wails Growing louder as it comes
nearer until it screams past the house up the street and
out of the neighborhood The house falls quiet again But

RIQUELME opens his eyes he can’t sleep anymore He reaches
for his watch and checks the time

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Riquelme boils water and places bread in the toaster Then he

opens the old refrigerator and removes some eggs
TIME CUT

Riquelme places a plate of scrambled eggs on the kitchen
table

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

He walks to a closed bedroom door pauses about to knock
Then he OPENS the door and looks inside

ON THE BED his handsome 14 year-old son Luis Looking
innocent like most sleepers Riquelme observes him for a
beat This is what matters

Closes the door KNOCKS on it

RIQUELME
Despierta

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME

Riquelme’s son LUIS -- a handsome 14 year-old -- rubs his
eyes and lets out a sigh Disappointed that it’s already
morning

He lays there a long beat listening to the OS sound of the
back door opening and closing Then the teen drags himself
out of bed into the hall to the

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME

where he raises the toilet seat and pisses Staring out the
window at his father

EXT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - SMALL BACKYARD - DAY

-assiduously attending to his plants and shrubs Then
filling a plastic bird feeder with seeds

Luis shakes his head at his father’s devotion to the yard
Then he flushes the toilet

TIME CUT

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Luis now sits before his breakfast plate shoveling eggs into
his mouth as

RIQUELME re-enters the kitchen from the back-door and begins
washing his hands in the sink

LUIS
(sleepily)
Papi I need ten pesos

RIQUELME
Why

LUIS

Riquelme dries his hands on a dish towel jibes the kid

RIQUELME
Since when do you go to school

LUIS

RIQUELME

LUIS

RIQUELME

LUIS
Oh si professor

RIQUELME

LUIS
Well I don’t want to either so

Riquelme shakes his head Then picks up his denim jacket
Slips it on

LUIS (contd)
So can I get some money

RIQUELME
You want money Come work You
used to come with me on Saturdays

LUIS
I had to stop ‘cause of futbol
RIQUELME
You haven’t played futbol in two
years
LUIS
Yeah well that league sucked
They was all disorganized and shit
(beat)

Papi for real I need some bolas
OS a horn toots from the street
RIQUELME
(pulls on a baseball cap)
If you want money in this world
Luis necesitas trabajar
Riquelme walks out of the kitchen
LUIS
(blithely)
A’ight then I’1ll just jack an ol’
lady in the street I don’t care

RIQUELME (0S)
That’s not funny

Luis hears the front door shut and he puts his fork down

LUIS
Damn

The kid goes into the living room and looks out the barred
window Sees his father climb inside his boss’ pick-up truck
They drive off and

LUIS looks down at a table by the door Notices that his
father left him a ten dollar bill

CUT TO

INT EXT -- THE PICK-UP TRUCK - LATER
driving through the Shangri-la streets of Bel-Air This
truck is a ‘97 Ford F-Series dark green with a

FLATBED rattling with old gardening tools shovels lawn
mowers leaf-blowers rakes etc

INSIDE THE TRUCK’S CAB two men are seated the driver is a
craggy-faced Mexican age 54 with a belly named

BLASCO MARTINEZ
--You ain’t buyin’ a truck You
ain’t even buyin’ a business
(Raises his calloused
index finger)
What you’re buyin’ is the American
Dream

The other man is

CARLOS RIQUELME
-I ain’t buyin’ your truck

Blasco removes his cell phone continues his pitch

BLASCO

Hello Mrs Donnelley This is
Blasco MartinezThe gardener
What’s your address again

CLOSE ON RIQUELME pondering his boss’ words staring
impassively out
THE WINDSHIELD as the truck advances through Bel-Air along
a verdant street of secluded mansions homes of the
fantastically wealthy

CUT TO
RIQUELME - ATOP A PALM TREE - SAME

75ft in the air (with nothing more securing him than a
flimsy safety belt) He’s pruning away dead fronds with
a knife making them fall down to the ground where

BLASCO stands with the uneasy owner of the house

MRS DONNELLEY
(looking up)
Please tell him to be careful

Blasco
If he falls I’11l catch him

MRS DONNELLEY
(cringes)
Oh God don’t say that

BLASCO
Ma’am he does this all the time
He’s a professional

TIGHT ON RIQUELME lathered in sweat Taking pains not to fall
to his death as he moves around the tree top Note it’s very
quiet in this yard He can hear everything below

BLASCO (contd)
See how gentle he’s being with
the green fronds

MRS DONNELLEY
I can’t see anything

BLASCO
They don’t look important but the
green fronds feed nutrients to the
whole tree You can’t cut them off
or the--

MRS DONNELLEY
(still worried)
Shouldn’t you be using one of those
cherry-picker things

BLASCO
If I had a cherry picker I’d have
to charge moreThis is the way we
do it in Mexico Believe me it’s
safe
RIQUELME
(in Spanish)
Then why don’t you get up here
fatty

MRS DONNELLEY
Are you insured

So that’s what she’s worried about

BLASCO
Mrs Donnelley I promise you I’m
fully insured and bonded

MRS DONNELLEY
(vaguely satisfied)
All right then

The woman walks back to her house and -- when she gets
out of earshot -- Blasco smiles mischievously up at
RIQUELME

(in a low cynical voice)
Fully insured and bonded huh

BLASCO
Just a little white lie

RIQUELME
For the white lady

BLASCO
Exactamente carnal You’re gonna
make a good business owner

Riquelme hangs up embarrassed and angry with himself He
stares at the phone for a long beat But there’s no one else
he can call

His eyes then drift out the kitchen’s barred window into

THE SMALL BACKYARD

where his well-tended tropical plants are in bloom We also
notice a birdhouse built into the yard’s only tree where

A ROBIN is perched pecking at a plastic seed-feeder
BACK ON RIQUELME

enough sulking time to get moving He stands up grabs his
denim jacket and walks over to

TIGHT ON RIQUELME

then suddenly refrains And in this refrain we glimpse the
gulf that exists between father and son One that Riquelme
can’t possibly bridge this morning All he can muster is

RIQUELME
Your Tia Anita says behave

LUIS
(bemused)
What She can’t tell me herself

RIQUELME

CUT TO
EXT A WORKERS’ CORNER - HIGH NOON

No one on the corner talks or moves for a long while
until

A LARGE DUMP TRUCK PULLS UP and the workers suddenly become
animated surging forward to get the attention of the

TRUCK DRIVER
I need two Only two

LATER - THE SAME CORNER
A Mercedes pulls away with two workers in the backseat

Now only seven remain Shifting about The sun beating down
on them with a will

RIQUELME stands there perfectly still and shuts his eyes as
if to blot out reality And when he opens them he sees a
meek

SALVADORAN MAN in a straw hat staring at him shrugging as if
to say this is how it is camarada get used to it

EXT A WORKER’S CORNER -STILL LATER

only two remain Riquelme and the meek Salvadoran who is now

munching on a bread roll Riquelme looks up the street No
one comes in the afternoon The day has been a total bust

The SALVADORAN tears off a piece of his bread Offers it to
Riquelme who embarrassed by the gesture takes the bread --
nods awkwardly gracias

CUT TO
EXT EAST LOS ANGELES - DUSK

A commercial stretch by El Mercadito Bustling with after-
work shoppers Buying groceries Browsing bootleg DVD’s
Eating at taco stands Drinking in bars Nortefio music
blasting over everything Soon

A PUBLIC BUS stops and Riquelme gets off exhausted and
demoralized He pushes through the crowd

TIME CUT

Riquelme is now walking down a familiar street of single-
story houses He passes a group of

TEENAGE GANG-BANGERS circled around a parked PT Cruiser
blasting a Chicano Rap song They ignore Riquelme and he
continues up the sidewalk to his own house where he is
stunned to see his sister

ANITA

dressed in her Nurse’s Assistant uniform getting out of her
car She seems anguished

RIQUELME
What are you doin’ here

ANITA
Let’s go inside

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - SAME

They enter the house and find a bare-chested LUIS half-asleep
on the couch before the TV the place is a shambles and reeks
of weed from his earlier adventures Once again we note
that

RIQUELME (while clearly disapproving) seems to feel it’s
useless to reprimand his son All he says is

RIQUELME
Your tia’s here Get up

Luis sits up and nods to his Aunt (but doesn’t stand)
LUIS

(clearing his throat)
Hola Tia

Anita looks at the boy coldly indicating her own history of
disapproval

ANITA
Hola Luis

LUIS
So you come to check on me
Behavin’

ANITA
-I came to see your father Luis

RIQUELME
(turning off the TV)
You want something to drink--
coffee

ANITA
No I can’t stay long I have to be
at work by ten or I’1ll get docked
(To Luis)
Can you leave us alone

LUIS
(scratching his rib cage)
--yeah sure okay

Luis hauls himself into his bedroom Shuts the door

RIQUELME
What’s goin’ on

Anita stares into her brother’s eyes

ANITA
(gravely)
I need you to tell me the truth
Carlos

RIQUELME
-About what

ANITA
You said if I loaned you the money
for the truck you’d be able to
repay it in under a year How can
you pay me back so fast Explain it
to me I’m not good with numbers

Anita’s tone unnerves Riquelme what’s wrong with her

RIQUELME
(uncomfortably)
Well with the truck and
Blasco’s accounts after all my

expenses I’d be takin’ home about
a thousand a week Maybe more

--That means I could pay you back
at least 1500 every monthSo in
8 months you have your money And
if anything were to happen to me
the truck would be yours You could
sell it and all the---

Anita doesn’t let him finish She forces something into his
hands Riquelme looks down at it it’s a bank withdrawal
envelope thick with cash

RIQUELME (contd)
(barely able to speak)
--I don’t understand Umberto

agreed

A beat

ANITA
--l didn’t ask Umberto

RIQUELME
What do you mean you didn’t ask
him

ANITA

He would’ve said no

Riquelme turns ashen can’t believe what she’s done what
he’s driven her to do

ANITA (cont’d)

Every month since Linda was
born he gives me some money from
his check to put awayin case one
of us becomes sick or gets laid
off we’ll have somethin’ to fall
back on

(beat)
The bank account is in my name He
never bothers to read the
statements

RIQUELME
He trusts you

Anita considers the irony of this

ANITA
Yeah he trusts me

Riquelme slowly shakes his head I can’t let you do this
RIQUELME

(holding out the envelope)
I’m sorry Anit--

ANITA
(starting for the door)
I have to go

RiQUELME
(grabbing her elbow)
Wait I can’t take this

ANITA
(pushing him away firmly)
Yes you can

RIQUELME
If something happens--
ANITA
Nothing’s gonna happen
RIQUELME
But you don’t understand if I
get--
ANITA

I understand everything
Anita glares at him enough arguing I know all the risks I
want to do this for you Riquelme engulfed with grief and
gratitude is unable to speak

ANITA (cont’d)

(softly)

--Buy the truck Carlos
(Beat)

And -- if you do well like you

say things are gonna change
(Beat)

That’s why we came here right

Anita smiles at her brother Then exits the house shutting
the door behind her

RIQUELME stands there looking down into his calloused hands
at the envelope He doesn’t know what to think or feel His
dreams have been buried for so long it’s almost impossible
to disinter them

LUIS emerges from his room Understands right away that
something of great significance has occurred In a low
concerned voice he asks

LUIS
What’s goin’ on

(the ever-present fear that all illegal’s endure no matter
how well life is going) begins to recede For the first time
in years he actually feels happy

Riquelme turns on the radio An upbeat song by Vicente
Fernandez is playing “El Nuevo Dia” He cranks up the volume

connecting with his son Before it’s too late

RIQUELME

the living-room and he sees his father sound asleep on the
fold-out couch next to

mowers shovels blowers wheelbarrows spread all around
the room (since they can’t be left in his truck)

There’s something very touching about this tableau

WE CAN’T TELL from Luis’s expression whether this moves him
or not but he lingers a moment looking at his father
asleep

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - THE KITCHEN

where he opens the fridge drinks from a juice carton Then
moves over to his room

His father’s disembodied voice calls out to him gently

Both are illuminated only by street lamps coming through the
barred windows Just enough light to see their faces

willing to release his father from whatever grudge he bears
against him

Riquelme smiles And we watch in real-time all of his
preparations putting on special shoes emptying his pockets
of his keys and cellphone -- so they don’t impede his legs
And lastly putting on a pair of special gloves Then

In real-time again we watch Riquelme climb up the trunk all
70 dangerous feet to the palm tree’s top An impressive act
of strength and courage

LUIS (contd)
Well I can report it for you I’m

RIQUELME

LUIS

RIQUELME
(sternly)
Luis these questions don’t help at
all Okay Just stay quiet

Riquelme turns his face to the window And

LUIS
(mutters to himself)
-This shiz is really fucked up
CUT TO
THE WORKERS CORNER - AN HOUR LATER
where 45 CENTRAL AMERICAN MEN stand waiting
ANGLE ON A PUBLIC BUS

stopping a block a way Riquelme and Luis get out Stare over
for several seconds at

THE MEN

who presently are besieging a Ford SUV in the hopes of being
hired please please pick me over here please me me

The sight elicits contempt from
LUIS (contd)
Que relajelook at these

The boy doesn’t realize how insulting this is to

RIQUELME

You think they want to do this
LUIS

Nah but

out there

LUIS
Well it’s also the fucker who stole
your puta truck

RIQUELME
Just wait here

We wait with Luis as he observes his father approach the
corner

HIS LONG POV

of Riquelme interrogating the workers Smiling not to tip
his hand you know a short guy named Santiago From El
Salvador Wears a straw hat Always comes here No What
about you I owe him money I gotta pay him back We worked
together You never seen him here

He moves through the large group man by man

-- Most shake their heads no

-- Others stare at him coldly (if we didn’t grasp this yet
there is a pronounced antipathy between Mexicans and other
Central American immigrants)

REVERSE ON LUIS

staring on frustrated by his father’s efforts But then he
sees

RIQUELME talking more promisingly with a SCAR-faced
SALVADORAN MAN in a Dodger’s cap about 30 Shifty-looking

The man keeps nodding as Riquelme plies him with more and
more questions They appear to be coming to an agreement

And shortly they walk away from the corner back over to

LUIS
What’s up

RIQUELME
This is Jesus He says he knows
him

Jesus stands there unable to follow their English

LUIS
And

RIQUELME
He’1l show us where Santiago lives
for fifty dollars

LUIS
(cynically)
Sure he will

Riquelme defends the logic of paying him

RIQUELME
He can’t work today if he takes us
there

LUIS
Just tell him to give us the
address

RIQUELME

He doesn’t know the street Just
the building

LUIS
Where

RIQUELME
(not sure himself to
Jesus )

LUIS
That’s Crip-land

Gangs Papi You heard of them
Were goin’ to Crip-land to find a
Salvatrucha

Riquelme can’t figure out if he is appalled or impressed by
Luis’s knowingness

CUT TO

EXT SOUTH CENTRAL LA - DAY

Once a black stronghold the area has absorbed a huge influx
of Latinos resulting in serious black-brown tensions and
significant violence

ANGLE ON A PUBLIC BUS

pulling over on Slauson Avenue It’s rear door opens and

street which dissects the infamous

EXT WALTER CARR HOUSING PROJECTS

a gang-plagued low-rise complex where presently some
FIFTY BLACK RESIDENTS mostly male teenagers are milling
about the parking lots and the lawns as our TRIO walks past

them at a purposeful pace

EXT A DIFFERENT STREET - 10 MINUTES LATER

Riquelme and Luis continue following Jesus But their faith
is wavering the neighborhood has become palpably more
dangerous Even the

GRAFFITI
is ominous “Too Many Mexicans Not enough Bullets”
LUIS
(after reading it)

Where the fuck he takin’ us

Riquelme looks at Luis be patient But a half-a block later
he asks Jesus

RIQUELME
éEstamos cerca

JESUS

(shakes his head)

No se
Luis looks at his father what do we do now
EXT GARDEN APARTMENT COMPLEX - THE SMALL PARKING LOT
in the center of the U-shaped Garden apartment complex

Riquelme and Luis (now trailed by Jesus) walk into frame and
see immediately that the truck is not parked here in the lot

ANGLE ON AN OLD ASIAN MAN

dressed in pajama pants and slippers taking his trash over
to a dumpster
RIQUELME

Excuse me I’m looking for a friend
who lives here Santiago You know

what apartment he’s in

The old man ignores the query Throws his trash out and then

goes back in his unit on the ground floor
Real friendly

RIQUELME (contd)
(resignedly)

»We’re gonna have to go door to

door

LUIS
--Nah hold up He stole your
phone right

RIQUELME
Yeah

LUIS
(takes out his prepaid
cell phone)

Let’s call your number and see if
we hear it ringin’ from one these

cribs

Good idea it’s quiet enough in the lot to hear inside the
shoddily built apartments Luis quickly speed dials his

father’s number Raises it to his ear

LUIS (contd)
It’s ringin’

They then listen out and suddenly hear a faint ringing sound

coming from a unit somewhere on the 2ND FLOOR

RIQUELME LUIS (FOLLOWED BY JESUS)

go over to the exterior staircase up to
THE 2ND FLOOR

but then the ringing stops

LUIS (contd)
Your voicemail picked up

RIQUELME
Call it again

Luis dials and the ringing begins again The three follow the

sound 30 feet to a unit at the end of the hall

RIQUELME (cont’d)
(standing in front of a
door listening)
This is it
It’s a tense moment for Riquelme and Luis but not for

JESUS (still clueless as to why they seek Santiago he just
wants his finder’s fee)

RIQUELME (contd)
Santiago aca

Jesus shrugs and blithely knocks on the door half-smiling
at

RIQUELME LUIS

who try to remain cool as they hear footsteps coming to
answer

THE DOOR

which is slowly cacked open by a LITTLE BOY age 5 with big
brown eyes looking out at

RIQUELME (contd)
--Hola chico--

But before he can say another word Luis barges inside
INT THE APARTMENT

a kind of illegal-immigrant sleeping-den the windows are
blacked-out by blankets and the floor is strewn with
mattresses atop which

SEVERAL SALVADORAN WORKERS

are out cold -- presumably men who work nights and sleep here
during the days

After getting over the initial shock of the place
LUIS
(calls out)
Santiago
No one responds
LUIS (contd)
(raises his voice)

Hey Santiago wake up

There’s some stirring but it’s too dim to see any faces

RIQUELME
(under his breath to
Luis)
Tranquilo
LUIS
Nah fuck this If he’s here he’s

here

A YOUNG WOMAN 24 enters from the kitchen Protectively
picks up her little boy

YOUNG WOMAN
(to Riquelme)
What’s going on

LUIS
Where’s Santiago

YOUNG WOMAN
Who are you

More stirring from the mattresses

RIQUELME
(trying to control the
situation)
Senora I’m sorry I’m looking for
my friend I have to give him
something Do you know where he is

YOUNG WOMAN
-What’s his name

RIQUELME
Santiago

She looks down at the sleepers some of whom are now leaning
up on their elbows listening

YOUNG WOMAN
--Anyone know a Santiago

No one responds
RIQUELME
Are you sure It’s very important I
see him

THE PRONE MEN

are inscrutable either they truly don’t know Santiago or
they do know him and refuse to admit it This galls

LUIS

and he pulls off a blanket from one of the windows flooding
the room with light infuriating

SEVERAL MEN
éQue te pasa LOCO

The now bright room reveals that Santiago is not here
ANGLE ON A MAN

getting up angrily grabbing the blanket from Luis Begins re-
securing it to the window muttering iDejanos en Paz

RIQUELME
(sternly)
Luis

LUIS
(barking back)
Why you frontin Tell ‘em if they
don’t fess up we callin’ La Migra

The mere mention of La Migra ratchets up the tension the
last thing these workers want is to be raided

From OS we hear someone clearing his throat

RIQUELME

looks into the kitchen and sees a

BEARDED MAN

nodding to him come talk to me we don’t want any trouble
IN THE KITCHEN

Riquelme and Luis enter noticing that even in here there’s
a triple-decker bunk bed (The apartment must sleep 25
people)

BEARDED MAN
I know Santiago What do you want
him for

RIQUELME
(sticking to his story)
I owe him money I want to pay

Riquelme takes the phone He reaches into his pocket --

LUIS

BEARDED MAN
No -- no The boy is right

A moment of understanding between the two older men

RIQUELME
Where is he now

BEARDED MAN
(points to an empty bunk bed)
He took his clothes and said he was
moving

Luis walks over to Santiago’s bunk snoops around while

-Where’s he work

Riquelme takes out a small roll of cash

LUIS
Just check it

Riquelme removes the spare key and tries the door as Luis
looks around anxiously to make sure no one’s coming

RIQUELME
It doesn’t work
LUIS
Lemme see the key
RIQUELME
(snapping)

I told you it doesn’t work
He then points at the truck’s body
RIQUELME (contd)
(now he’s certain)
It’s not even the right color
green Come on
They both hustle off continue searching
CUT TO
A WIDE SHOT OF THE PARKING LOT - 3 MINUTES LATER

We hold on this car-filled frame for a few beats And then
Luis enters from the right and Riquelme from the left

Both have come up empty the truck is not here Their only
hope is to see if Santiago is inside working

Riquelme moves over to the back of the club Peeks inside the
window of the

INT EL BURRO NIGHTCLUB - KITCHEN

buzzing with 20 workers cooks waiters busboys

Note this window view is obscured by hanging pots and it’s
difficult to see people clearly

LUIS
-Is he there

RIQUELME
(frustrated)
I don’t know I gotta go in

They walk around to the front and see that the

LINE OF PEOPLE

has grown in size It’ll take forever to enter this way And
besides the

BOUNCERS

don’t appear to be the most friendly souls presently they’re
turning away TWO MEN (in sneakers) who fail the dress code
So

RIQUELME

(in his simple clothes) doesn’t stand a chance at the door
If he wants in he’s going to have find another way

CUT TO
EXT EL BURRO NIGHTCLUB - THE SIDE OF THE CLUB

where there’s a smoker’s outdoor lounge watched over by a
single

BOUNCER
dressed in all black a mountain of a man

LUIS RIQUELME stand in the shadows weighing their options
with furrowed brows The boy floats an idea albeit a
cockamamie one

LUIS
What if I go break a car window
Make an alarm go off
(Nods at the bouncer)
Then you run up to big man here
and tell him that---

Riquelme holds up his hand stop

RIQUELME
dust wait out here

LUIS
What’re you gonna do

RIQUELME
»-I don’t know

Riquelme walks towards the bouncer And we remain with Luis
observing the following interaction via

THE KID’S LONG POV of his father going over and entreating
the bouncer (it’s too far away to hear his words) with
several direct sentences

After he’s done the stone-faced bouncer moves aside
allowing Riquelme to enter the club no problemo

REVERSE on Luis baffled -- what the hell did he say to him
CUT TO
INT EL BURRO NIGHTCLUB - LUPILLO RIVERA’S FACE - ON STAGE

(one of LA’s most famous narcocorrido acts) crooning into a
microphone

LUPILLO RIVERA
Dijero los policias al grupo de
campesinos “Todos las manos en
alto si es que quieren seguir
vivos” Ahi empez6é la masacre y
sonaron muchas tiros Fueron 17
Muertos y comos 28 heridos

REVERSE SHOT of the jam-packed club roiling with 700 people
dancing to

TIGHT ON RIQUELME trying to look over the crowd in the
direction of the

KITCHEN DOORS a good 25 yards away from
RIQUELME who begins moving through the crush of
DANCING PEOPLE singing loudly along with

LUPILLO RIVERA
Ya me cansé de llorar por esto que
ha sucedido Mandaro a acribillar a
indefensos campesinos Bajaban de
Atoyaquillo con otros de Paso
Real Y los embosc6 el gobierno
criminal

ANGLE ON THE KITCHEN DOORS as a busboy comes out Riquelme
stops him

RIQUELME
(in Spanish)
Amigo I’m looking for Santiago Is
he workin’ tonight
BUSBOY
(not hearing him)
Who

RIQUELME
The dishwasher Santiago

The busboy points at the kitchen and walks off

RIQUELME takes a deep breath this is it Anger admixed with
adrenaline begins coursing through his veins as he enters

INT EL BURRO NIGHTCLUB - THE KITCHEN
a capacious room where several cooks are preparing meals over
steaming pots and flaming grills Riquelme has to stop

momentarily when another

BUSBOY comes towards him carrying a garbage can

INT EL BURRO NIGHT CLUB -- ANGLE ON LUIS

approaching the back window to try to see what’s going on
As luck would have it a cook removes two of the hanging
pans thereby freeing the boy’s view of

INT EL BURRO NIGHTCLUB - THE KITCHEN

where Riquelme is on the move again past refrigerators food
prep bays stockrooms etc

RIQUELME’S EYES scanning every corner

EXTINT EL BURRO NIGHT CLUB - KITCHEN -- INTERCUT

LUIS is at the window craning his neck but losing sight
of

RIQUELME now nearing a dish-washing station where a

SHORT MAN with his back turned is rinsing martini glasses and
placing them into a tall storage rack by the sink

RIQUELME
-Oye

The dishwasher turns around and gasps inaudibly It’s

SANTIAGO

The two immigrants share a frozen moment One that allows
Riquelme to look into Santiago’s eyes and see something so
pitiable that his anger diminishes he just wants his truck
back But before he can demand this

SANTIAGO

grabs hold of the STORAGE RACK OF GLASSES and pushes it at
Riquelme the rack cascades on top of him and the glasses
smash to the floor allowing Santiago to take off like a shot
over to the kitchen’s emergency exit door

OUTSIDE

where he sprints off into the darkened parking lot

EXT EL BURRO NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

LUIS looking up seeing a figure burst out of the door
Knowing that it must be Santiago -- and taking off after him
INT EL BURRO NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

BACK ON RIQUELME getting off the floor -- now surrounded by
kitchen workers abusing him in Spanish He brushes the broken
glass shards off him and bustles for the door

EXT EL BURRO NIGHT CLUB

SANTIAGO is sprinting as fast as his short legs can take him
He’s a good 200 hundred yards away from the club

LUIS is chasing behind gaining ground with every step The
teen is much faster and stronger than

SANTIAGO who already appears to be losing steam

WIDE SHOT
only 10 feet separates them now and

LUIS lunges out and tackles the thief They roll several
times on the ground Then the teen springs up And Santiago
tries to punch and kick him

NOW RIQUELME is racing towards them 50 yards away all he
can see is

A SILHOUETTED SKIRMISH too dark to know exactly what’s
happening

RIQUELME
(terribly afraid)
LUIS

BACK ON LUIS standing over Santiago (who lays on the ground
motionlessly as the teen beats him to a pulp) rifling
through his pockets Looking for anything Keys Money

All that he finds is a piece of paper

LUIS
(screaming in his face)
Where’s the FUCKIN’ truck

Santiago doesn’t respond So Luis kicks him in the ribs
Making the man groan Then he kicks him again Harder

RIQUELME
(finally arriving)
STOP

Riquelme pushes Luis away Looks down at Santiago covered in
blood and writhing in pain In need of a hospital

LUIS
(waving the piece of
paper )
Look at this

Riquelme grabs the paper Reads it with shaking hands

INSERT

a Western Union Money Transfer receipt in the amount of
2999 sent to an address in El Salvador

LUIS (contd)
(to Santiago like a mad
man)
You sold the truck

TIGHT ON RIQUELME’S FACE
staggered could he have sold it for so little

LUIS (contd)
(shaking Santiago by the
collar)
DID YOU SELL THE TRUCK Answer me
you fuck

Santiago says nothing he looks semi-conscious now That
doesn’t stop the teen from punching him again

RIQUELME
(grabbing his arm)
Luis ENOUGH

The boy struggles wildly to get free of his father’s
clutches

LUIS

(frothing)
You wanna be nice to THIS BITCH
What about all that shit you said
about movin’ to a better
neighborhood A better house
Changin’ our lives How DA fuck are
WE gonna do it NOW

RIQUELME Falls to the ground and sits there astonished The
Western Union receipt has killed him

ANGLE ON SANTIAGO

getting to his knees trying to stand to muster the strength
to run away but LUIS kicks him to the ground

Riquelme gets up and intercedes slapping the boy on the side
of the head He’s afraid Luis will kill Santiago

RIQUELME
(at the top of his lungs)
DON’T TOUCH HIM ANYMORE

LUIS
(crying shocked by his
father hitting him)
FUCK YOU

Luis blindly lunges at Santiago (can the teen’s fury really
be just about the truck)

RIQUELME pushes him away again waving a clenched fist This
has turned into something grotesque Father and son appear at
the point of blows

RIQUELME
ENOUGH

LUIS
(through tears)
YOU HIT ME BUT NOT HIM

RIQUELME
CALM DOWN

LUIS

CALM DOWN
Riquelme tries to grab the boy to subdue him

RIQUELME
ENOUGH

LUIS
(pushing his father away)
FUCK YOU

The teen turns and runs off And Riquelme watches him
helplessly for several seconds Then he follows after the
boy calling desperately --

Riquelme (CONTD)

Luis -- Luis
(In Spanish)
Stay there -- or you’re a dead man

FRANTIC SHOT

Riquelme goes looking for Luis amongst the cars the streets

calling for him -- but he’s gone
FADE TO BLACK
THEN FADE UP
ON

EXT EAST LA - A PANORAMIC SHOT

Many storefronts are shuttered and silent And

THE STREETS

are less noisy traffic is lighter it’s Sunday

EXT A HOUSING PROJECT COMPLEX

run-down and covered by gang graffiti

CLOSE SHOT OF A DOOR

as a hand knocks upon it three times No one answers so the
hand knocks again And finally the door is opened by

FACUNDO
in his boxer briefs Obviously he was sleeping At 12 noon
FACUNDO
(raspy)
Mr Riquelme
REVERSE ON RIQUELME standing outside the door
RIQUELME

Sorry to bother

FACUNDO
That’s okay No problem

RIQUELME
Is Luis here
FACUNDO
Uh
RIQUELME
I need to talk with him
FACUNDO
Yeah he’s here
(Pauses )

You wanna come in

RIQUELME
Thanks I’1l just wait outside

FACUNDO
A’ight Lemme go wake his ass

The teen disappears and Riquelme casts a look around behind
him at the rundown project complex the place his son has
defaulted to A few moments later

LUIS comes to the door Looks at his father coldly like a
complete stranger

A beat

LuIs
‘Sup

RIQUELME
Hey

RIQUELME (contd)
-I tried calling youyour phone

The boy shrugs

A beat

LUIS

RIQUELME
--Il wanted to make sure you were
okay
LUIS
I’m fine
RIQUELME
You sure
LUIS

Yeah

RIQUELME
I was really worried

Luis doesn’t say anything

RIQUELME (cont’d)
You scared me last night
(a beat) )
I didn’t want you to get in
trouble

LUIS
You ain’t gotta worry about me

RIQUELME
But I do worry I worry about you
all the time

Luis has nothing to say to this

RIQUELME (contd)
You asked me a question before
about why people have kids--

Luis averts his eyes Refuses to be reached Riquelme then
does something oddhe SINGS in a small somewhat halting
voicesomething that sounds like a children’s song

RIQUELME (CONT’D) (contd)
Yo le dije al zapatero que me
hiciera unos zapatos con un
piquito redondo como lo tienen los
patos --

Luis
What the hell is that

RIQUELME
A song

LUIS
Well stop it Damn You losin’ it
completely

Riquelme tries another way in

RIQUELME
-Santiago told me where he sold
the truck

LUIS
(indifferently)
Oh yeah where

Riquelme removes a slip of paper Holds it out for Luis to
take

RIQUELME
A mercado negro He gave me the
address I’m gonna try to get it
back

The boy doesn’t take the paper So Riquelme places it back in
his pocket Then asks

RIQUELME (contd)
-YOU wanna come with me

LUIS

A beat

RIQUELME
-Okay then Luis

They share a last look And Riquelme walks away

LUIS watches him for a second seems to want to say
something but then steps back

INSIDE THE APARTMENT

and shuts the door Stands there a long beat thinking with
his back turned to

FACUNDO

on the couch he overheard everything and seems amused by
Luis’ intransigence towards his father

FACUNDO
(in a sleepy sarcastic
voice)
Man you is one ruthless-ass
gangsta

Luis ignores him walks towards the bathroom as Facundo turns
on his TV set

FACUNDO (contd)
If I had a pops I’d never do him
like that
(Pauses to yawn)
You is cold kidFreezin’ cold

ANGLE ON LUIS

inside the bathroom Staring at himself in the mirror an
old young man Deeply confused and unhappy

FACUNDO (0S) (contd)
Ayo I decided I ain’t jumpin’ in

CLOSER ON LUIS’ FACE

not paying attention to his friend his mind is still with
his father

FACUNDO (0S) (contd)
I’m ‘a do like mi hermano did He

Luis doesn’t answer

FACUNDO (0S) (contd)
(Continuing his monologue)
Yeah man I just go in the street

CUT TO

EXT BUS SHELTER - DAY
Riquelme sits alone in a bus shelter outside the projects

The streets are quiet and still We hold on this static
frame for a long beat

Then from OS footsteps are heard approaching

Getting louder as they draw nearer Until finally

Luis enters the shelter and sits next to his father
CUT TO

THE SKY - AT DUSK

as a 747 jumbo jet makes its final descent into

EXT LAX - SAME

where other planes are pulling up to the gates refueling
taxiing on runways as

RIQUELME LUIS

walk along a service road just outside the airport but within
earshot of the vacuum-cleaner drone of jet turbines

EXT STREET NEAR LAX - NIGHT

the drone is fainter as Riquelme and Luis now progress by the
airport’s rental agency lots teeming with cars

We pan with them as they pass camera then crane up to see
that father and son are heading towards the

COMMERCIAL AREA
just east of LAX -- an enclave of shady businesses
pawnshops strip clubs bail bondsmen etc It’s almost
completely dark now

CUT TO
AN AMERICAN FLAG

rippling in the wind We hold on Old Glory for a beat Then
slowly tilt down to

EXT ALL-AMERICAN AUTO-MART

a used-car dealership dark and closed for the night The lot
is surrounded by a 12 foot barbed-wire fence with a

SECURITY GUARD

sitting in a booth at the front gate

REVERSE SHOT

of Riquelme and Luis across street Surveying the dealership

LUIS
This is the black market

Riquelme double-checks his piece of paper Then nods back
this is it

CLOSE ON RIQUELME and LUIS

staring at the guard in the booth The teen remarks on the
similarity of the situation

LUIS (contd)

(nods at the guard)
--You gonna roll up on ‘im like

Riquelme doesn’t get the quip huh
LUIS (contd)

At the club What did you say to
that bouncer to get inside

A beat
RIQUELME
Nothing
- LUIS
Nothin’
Riquelme shrugs
RIQUELME

I just told him that my truck was
stolen and that I needed to talk
with Santiago the dishwasher

LUIS
That’s all you said

RIQUELME
That’s all

LUIS
And he believed you

RIQUELME
I was telling the truth

The teen thinks about it oh yeah
RIQUELME (contd)
Come on
EXT ALL-AMERICAN AUTO-MART

Riquelme and Luis are now moving through a dark and empty
field behind the dealership --

-- stopping when they reach the barbed-wire fence Then
staring into the

DEALERSHIP’S LOT

filled with approximately 300 used vehicles It’s too dark to
discern if the truck is here

LUIS
(whispers nods)
Look
ANGLE ON A GARAGE BUILDING

at the far corner of the lot a light burns inside

RIQUELME
Somebody’s still working

Father and son share a look now what

NEW ANGLE

Riquelme and Luis tiptoe along the barbed-wire fence until
they get near the garage building

The fence runs right up along side the building allowing
Riquelme and Luis to peak through

THE WINDOW

into the garage where a Ford Mustang is being worked on by

TWO MECHANICS both Anglos leaning over the engine block
while nearby a

SIBERIAN HUSKY sleeps on the floor next to an oil stain
Riquelme and Luis retreat from the window

CUT TO
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOT

Still by the fence father and son regroup Stare into the lots

POV PANNING SHOT
from the back garage building -- all the way across the darkened
car lot -- to the front gate where the guard booth sits
BACK ON RIQUELME
as he reaches a decision
RIQUELME (contd)
I’m gonna climb over and look

around

The teen is hesitant especially after seeing the big dog

RIQUELME (contd)
(removing his denim
jacket)

I want you to stay out here and
watch for the guard If he leaves
the booth whistle and I’11 climb
back over Okay

LUIS
Okay

Riquelme begins scaling the 12 foot fence

And when he nears the top he drapes his jacket over the barbed
wire Then pulls himself adroitly over and hops downONTO THE
CAR LOT SIDE where he looks back through the fence

RIQUELME
Be careful hijito

LUIS
You too

Riquelme takes off to search for the truck and

LUIS

watches him disappear into the lot Affected by his father’s
courage He then scurries off to check on the guard
ANGLE ON RIQUELME

creeping through the darkened dealership through rows of

cars searching everywhere for his truck Nothing yet
ANGLE ON LUIS

lurking up to the guard booth He gets about ten yards away
and sees that

THE GUARD

has dozed off in his chair a stroke of luck NOTE we see
that the guard has a holstered gun on his hip

REVERSE

on the Luis drifting back towards his position along the
fence Concerned about his father

CLOSE ON RIQUELME

now searching near the garage building Being especially
careful not to make noise and then freezing when he sees

THE SIBERIAN HUSKY

standing at the garage door sniffing at the air

CLOSER ON THE DOG

letting out three demonstrative barks Woof Woof Woof
After which the dog mopes back inside the garage and

RIQUELME

lets out a sigh of relief Continues his search

ANGLE ON LUIS

across the lot Greatly alarmed by the dog’s bark He isn’t
in a position to see anything so

He starts hastening along the fence scouring the lot for
sight of his father when suddenly he sees

THE TRUCK

parked in a darkened section of the lot just 15 feet on the
other side -- with a tarp over the flatbed covering the

tools But it’s the truck definitely

REVERSE ON LUIS

wanting to scream out He climbs up the fence half-way to get
a better view of the lot to try to glimpse his father But
it’s too dark to see anything

The teen hops off and runs 20 yards Looks into the lot
again but still can’t spot Riquelme So --

Luis decides to try to climb over into the lot He looks up
at the formidable barbed-wire atop the fence And --

-- begins climbing the fence to the top Pausing to take a
deep breath The boy hasn’t anything to protect him from the
razor sharp barbs But he mans up and --

swings his leg over somehow clearing the barbed-wire and
finding a toe hold on the other side of the fence

He takes another deep breath and now swings his other leg

over but gets it ensnared in the barbed wired

CLOSE ON LUIS

trying to pull it free Fuck He loses his grip and slips

deeper into the barbed wire Now he’s completely caught --
between both sides of the fence

LUIS (contd)
(in agony under his
breath)
Puta

TIGHT ON RIQUELME hearing something He takes few steps
looks up and sees

LUIS flailing atop the fence in terrible distress
RIQUELME races over Rapidly climbs up to help his son

RIQUELME
€QUE PASO

LUIS
(though clenched teeth)
The truck is here I saw it It’s
over there

Riquelme doesn’t care about the truck right now He takes out
his pocket knife and cuts his son’s jeans and shirt --

-- freeing the boy and with one arm (his other is holding
onto the fence) lifts him safely over the barbed wire

They both climb down the fence and are now on the lot
Ducking down so as not to be seen

RIQUELME
You okay

Luis is shaken and bleeding where the barbs cut his legs He
looks at his father gratefully Then says

LUIS
The truck

They hustle 20 yards over to
THE TRUCK -- a moment of sheer elation then --

-- seeing that the windshield has been removed And not
replaced yet A gaping hole

RIQUELME pulls back the tarp covering the truck’s flatbed

RIQUELME
MY TOOLS ARE ALL HERE

OS the dog starts barking he’s heard them

Father and son quickly get inside the truck

LUIS
(looking back towards the
garage)
i VAMONOS

RIQUELME digs into his pocket and removes his spare key when
suddenly

THE SIBERIAN HUSKY is upon them leaping up pawing
Riquelme’s driver’s side window barking snapping his fangs
ferociously

LUIS (contd)
START IT

RIQUELME’S HAND quakes as he inserts the key Turns it and
starts the engine
ANGLE ON THE DOG

barking louder more viciously Trying to jump up onto the
hood -- where there’s no windshield glass

LUIS (contd)
(looking back)
They’re comin’ GO GO
ANGLE ON THE TWO MECHANICS

running towards the truck just 20 feet away

ANGLE ON THE DOG
at the front fender up climbing onto the truck’s hood
LUIS (contd)
(terrified)
OH FUCK
TIGHT ON RIQUELME
as his OLD WORKBOOT floors the gas pedal making
THE TRUCK peel out of it’s spot causing the
VICIOUS DOG to go sliding off the hood to the side
LUIS (contd)
(can’t believe it)

Holy--

The truck roars through the lot through the rows of used
cars as

THE TWO MECHANICS

continue chasing as does
THE DOG

runningbarking right behind
THE TRUCK

barreling down the center lane of the lot towards the closed
front gate where

THE SECURITY GUARD

stands directly in front of the gate with his gun raised
Aiming it squarely at

RIQUELME

who doesn’t duck down or show any fear this is my truck

ANGLE ON LUIS

crouched in his seat Watching his father Confounded by his
fearlessness

LUIS (contd)

DUCK DOWN
TIGHT ON THE GUARD
squinting his eyes aiming his gun about to fire at
RIQUELME
still not flinching as he bears down on the guard in a life
and death duel of nerves The truck is now just ten yards
away from

THE GUARD

who pulls back the hammer on his gun About to squeeze the
trigger But for some reason he wavers

-- lowering his gun without firing and stepping aside
allowing the

TRUCK
to smash through the locked gate CRASH And out onto the
street Sparks flying as the front-end scrapes the concrete

And then turns wildly --

-- screeches away

ANGLE ON THE GUARD
by the demolished gate with the two mechanics and the Husky
We see that they aren’t going to chase anymore
ANGLE ON THE TRUCK
speeding (sans a windshield) up Sepulveda Blvd
INSIDE THE TRUCK
the teen is in a state of euphoric shock
LUIS (contd)
THAT SHIT WAS NUTS
CLOSE ON RIQUELME

proud)

LUIS

Riquelme stops the truck at a red light next to a
POLICE CAR

in the next lane where the

TWO COPS

inside stare over at the windshield-less truck

BACK ON LUIS RIQUELME
realizing they’ve been spotted
LUIS (contd)
(under his breath)
Drive off

Riquelme doesn’t move

LUIS (contd)
Go

The traffic light turns green

LUIS (contd)

Finally Riquelme pulls away Slowly advances up the block
Dreadfully peaks into his door mirror seeing the

POLICE CAR
following behind like fate itself

LUIS (contd)

Riquelme doesn’t answer He continues driving on until
THE COPS flash their lights
Cop

(over a loudspeaker)
Hey truck Pull over here please

TIGHT ON LUIS

desperately imploring his father as red white and blue and
lights wash over the boy

LUIS
Go Papi please

But Riquelme acquiesces Pulls the truck over on the side of
the road He’s not going to run And risk his son’s life

LUIS (contd)
What are you doin’ go

Riquelme LOOKS HIS SON IN THE EYE This is about him He
reaches fro the key in the ignition

Luis puts his hand over his father’s trying to pry it off
Both hands

LUIS (contd)
Go

But Riquelme’s hand is too strong He TURNS OFF THE TRUCK
removes the key

A blond-haired cop sidles up to the truck and leans in
COP
May I have your driver’s license

CLOSE ON RIQUELME’S FACE

as he claps his eyes shut Perhaps hoping that when he opens
them again this will have been a dream

Spanish He’s the precinct’s Immigration Control Liaison A
gruff man with a good heart named
OFFICER ANDREWS (TO PHONE)

moment

OFFICER ANDREWS (contd)
You want somethin’ to drink

Luis glares at him coldly without answering fuck you
CUT TO

Where Riquelme sits alone with his hands cuffed to the top of
the table Like a common criminal

Note the room has a large plexi-glass window that allows him
to look out at Luis and vice versa

We hold on this shot of Riquelme bound until the
DOOR OPENS
and Officer Andrews enters carrying a manila file jacket

OFFICER ANDREWS (contd)
I spoke with Sandra Martinez the

backed up your story

The cop sits down at the table

RIQUELME
(softly)
»-SO can I leave now

OFFICER ANDREWS
I’m afraid not
(Points at the file)
There’s two outstanding warrants in

The cop opens the file

OFFICER ANDREWS (contd)

(begins reading)
The first is for an ‘02 felony
possession of false government
documents

(Looks up guesses)
That would be a fake social
security card right

Riquelme doesn’t answer him so

Blasco’s daughter’s gonna pick it

ANITA

That’s what you think That I’m
cool with that

You know what’s gonna happen now

(Luis shrugs)
You want to know something about

years that man gave me a place and
took care of me and fed me and
protected me

Everything I have in this world is
because of his love and generosity

LUIS

Luis is crying now bitter tears and he’s angry that they’re
being seen Anita is stunned -- almost enough to take a
different tack and apologize but her responsibilities take
her down a different road

ANITA

That’s not true You got me Your
Dad wants you to come stay with me

INSIDE RUTHIE’S APARTMENT

a party is in full swing with twenty high school kids
drinking beer smoking weed and dancing to Reggaeton It’s
noisy and very dark But we’re able to discern that these
kids are all gang-bangers or would be gang-bangers Evidenced
by their tatoos hairstyles and clothes

REVERSE ON LUIS

CUT TO

EXT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - DAY

in the noon-day sun

INSIDE
Luis sleeps soundly on the couch in the living room For some

reason he choose to spend the night -- not in his own bed --
but in his father’s

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

Luis makes himself a sandwich looks out the window at the --

LONE TREE

that his father planted in the backyard On the branch the
resident

ROBIN

pecks at its plastic seed feeder which is empty yet the bird
continues pecking vainly tap tap tap It’s so conditioned
to being fed that it’s unable to think for itself Finally
the creature smartens up and flies away

REVERSE

on Luis (indifferent to the symbolism) He walks back

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

and looks around Feeling the emptiness of the space A
space -- he understands -- that his father will never return
to And that he’1l have to leave shortly

INT RIQUELME’S HOUSE - LUIS’S BEDROOM
Luis looks around here as well The posters the dirty

laundry the wall clock It all feels like someone else’s
stuff

Luis then reaches into the closet and removes a small bag of
marijuana from a hiding space

IN THE LIVING ROOM

The boy sits down on the couch And in real time we observe
him rolling a joint Going through the ritual which will
allow him to ease his pain

And when he’s done he sets the tip of the joint on fire
click and inhales deeply

CUT TO
INT THE DETENTION CENTER CAFETERIA

at San Pedro A pro bono lawyer age 31 (from the California
Immigrant Aid Society) sits at a lunch table -- a no nonsense
man named

GABE WETTENAL
(looking at some papers
distractedly)
Mr Riquelme I’m an attorney Do
want me to speak Spanish

REVERSE ON RIQUELME sitting across from the lawyer

RIQUELME
I understand English

GABE WETTENAL
I work for an NGO that helps
illegal aliens Do you already
have an attorney to represent you
at your pre-hearing tomorrow

RIQUELME
I don’t have any money

GABE WETTENAL
I understand My services are
free

The government doesn’t provide
legal representation to aliens but
San Pedro works with Californias
Legal Aid Society to offer its
detainees access to pro bono
council

Riquelme doesn’t understand any of this

RIQUELME
I’m sorry I can’t pay a lawyer

GABE WETTENAL
Right I’m free I’m just here to
help advise you about your pre-
hearing I don’t cost anything

RIQUELME
-What’s a pre-hearing

The lawyer tries to make it as simple as possible

GABE WETTENAL

Tomorrow you’re going to go before
an immigration judge He’s going
to ask you a question whether or
not you plan on fighting removal
from this country

(Beat)
If you tell him that you wish to
fight then he’1ll assign you a date
in the future for your Removal
Hearing

(Beat)
If you tell him that you don’t want
to fight then the judge will order
your immediate deportation right
after the hearing

Riquelme is overcome with welter of questions and concerns
RIQUELME
I have a 14 year-old son that was

born here I’m his only parent

GABE WETTENAL
-Where is he now

RIQUELME
With my sister

GABE WETTENAL
Will she take care of him for you

RIQUELME
Yes

The lawyer considers this Then looks down at Riquelme’s
file Reads it over again then says

A beat

GABE WETTENAL

Based on your prior deportation and
felony offense the judge is not
going to offer you bail Regardless
of your sole provider status

(Beat)
So if you decide to fight
deportation you’ll have to stay in
this detention center until your
Removal Hearing

RIQUELME
How long will that be

GABE WETTENAL
That depends on the docket
schedule But you can figure on at
least three months Probably more
like six before you get a chance to
argue your case in court

The prospect of being locked up that long is stunning to

A beat

A beat

RIQUELME
Six months

GABE WETTENAL

Now if you can afford to sit in
this jail for that amount of time
And not earn money while you do so
Maybe you can try to build a case
against removal

(Beat)
But my services are only for Pre-
Hearing motions For Removal
Hearings you’ll need to hire a
lawyer to represent you

RIQUELME
-How much

GABE WETTENAL
In the thousands of dollars

RIQUELME
--What would be my chances
GABE WETTENAL

Zero

(beat)
Not exactly zero But only 3 of
all Removal Hearings result in an
alien being granted asylum
Thousands of people are deported
each year who have children younger
than yours Even aliens that have
clean records and pay taxes

Riquelme sits there in a quandary And the lawyer stands up

GABE WETTENAL (contd)

Give it some thought You have
until tomorrow to make your final
decision

(Closes his brief case)
But if it was me I wouldn’t waste
any money fighting it It’s cheaper
and faster to get deported and then
just pay a coyote to bring you back
in

Riquelme looks up

GABE WETTENAL (cont’d)
See you at the pre-hearing

CUT TO

INT HOLDING PEN - DAY

Riquelme squats his back literally against the wall He is
an island of fear and solitude in the hellscape Nearby a

phone -- COVERED in scratches ball-point pen ink messages
amongst them over and over “MS” “MS-13 “Mara
Salvatrucha” -- the signs for the most violent and pervasive

gang in the center the Mara Salvatrucha Central Americans
from El Salvador Honduras Nicaragua

Riquelme takes several deep breathes and STANDS

BY A CORNER

A group of men most naked to the waist are rolling dice
putting down money talking shit Their backs are to the
rest of the room and the rest of the room keeps clear Their

backs are also FESTOONED with tattoos -- “solo dios puede
juzgarme” “Smile now cry later” The circle is closed to
Riquelme

RIQUELME

Excuse me Lo siento Lo siento
Lo siento

H HH

Ignored Riquelme finally gingerly places his hand on the
shoulder of one of the gang-bangers At that as if one
organism the entire posse turns and faces him radiating
hostility It is a frightening view -- many of these boys
(barely eighteen) have full body and FACIAL tattoos
generally with the MS motif Signs of not ever being able to
go back

GANG-BANGER
Why you touchin’ me bitch You a
fag

RIQUELME
No

ANOTHER
You lookin’ for a way out You
lookin’ to die

RIQUELME
I’m looking for the man in charge

GANG-BANGER
That’s me And I’m telling you to
step off ‘fore I got to end you

puto

RIQUELME
II’m lookin’ for the man in
charge

This doesn’t satisfy them They group around him mad-
dogging him staring him down Riquelme keeps his eyes low
not meeting their eyes but not leaving

ANOTHER VOICE
Dejalo pasar

The sea of hostile faces parts to reveal sitting there a
man in his twenties his face unmarked perhaps explaining
his survival he has the air of someone in his forties
This is LA RATA

LA RATA
You know who I am

RIQUELME
No sir

LA RATA

You know where I’m from

RIQUELME
El Salvador I think

LA RATA

RIQUELME

LA RATA
What does nobody want from me You

RIQUELME

(Beat his head still

down )
I’m his father I’m his father
I’m his father

CUT TO
THE BACKYARD

as Luis lays on the ground Staring up at the cloudless blue
sky Under the full glare of the sun

The boy appears extremely stoned his eyes are glassy and
his limbs are torpid and numb

OS the phone begins ringing again But he ignores it

TIME CUT

AN HOUR LATER

INSIDE THE KITCHEN

eH HF

Luis enters from the yard and drinks water directly from the
sink’s faucet Wipes his mouth on his arm and walks over to

the
ANSWERING MACHINE

blinking with a new message

REVERSE

on Luis not sure if he wants to hear it Finally he presses

the play button and

RIQUELME’S VOICE
(begins to fill the room)
Hola Hijito Are you there
(Beat)
If you’re there please pick up
It’s important

Luis can hear the echo of the prison on the tape Buzzing

sounds menacing laughter and outbursts

RIQUELME’s VOICE (contd)

I just called tia She said you
aren’t with her Are you home

(Pauses )
Please son if you’re there pick
up I really need to hear your
voice And know that you’re okay
I’m very worried about you

CLOSER ON LUIS

closing his eyes to stave off tears his father’s worry and

concern is palpable And agonizing to listen to

RIQUELME’S VOICE (contd)

I have my hearing tomorrow at the
Immigration Court here at San
Pedro If you can come I would
really appreciate it It may be
the

(pauses doesn’t complete

the thought)
Hijito I want you to know that I
was trying to make things better
for us Better for you The
only thing that matters is that
youre alright that you’re going
to be okay That you would have a
chance to stay away from these--

(pay phone beeps)
You don’t know important that is
hijito please promise me that
you’11--

Suddenly the message cuts off and Luis opens his eyes he
managed to keep his tears in
Barely But the call has thrown him deeper into despair
And then from OS --

He hears the sound of footsteps coming up the porch stairs
followed by a loud happy knock on the front door

FACUNDO (0OS)
Ayo Luis Open up gangsta

HOLD ON LUIS

not moving a muscle
FACUNDO (0S) (cont’d)
Come on bee-atch open up this
door

The burly kid begins drumming a Lil’ Rob beat on the door
rapping mindlessly to the rhythm

FACUNDO (contd)
One hell of a lookin’ beat the
least of my feats from west to
eastfrom north to south not
knowin’ what it’s all about top me
on the scout looking for my new
recruits to follow my boots down

beggin’ you to come play But if
you’re out you better pray
because we’re comin’ your way
TRUCHA

Facundo stops rapping figuring his friend isn’t home

TIGHT ON LUIS

standing motionless listening to Facundo walk off the porch
down the stairs and away from the house

Luis moves softly over to his barred window looks stealthily

teenagers blurry in the distance as we

ON A 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY

Riquelme dressed in his prison jumpsuit hands and feet still
shackled -- is directed by a guard into

A SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM where

GABE WETTENAL
(stands and greets him)
Good morning Mr Riquelme

RIQUELME
Good morning

The guard helps Riquelme sit in a chair and then leaves

GABE WETTENAL
(still standing)
Have you made your decision

Riquelme nods but doesn’t reveal what it is

GABE WETTENAL (CONT’D)
Fair enough I think its for the
best
(Beat)
There’s someone here to see you

The lawyer exits the room and we push in on
RIQUELME’S FACE

waiting to see who this someone is A moment later the
lawyer returns with

LUIS
wearing the soccer jersey his father bought him

GABE WETTENAL (contd)
I’1l leave you alone
(Looks at his watch)
You have about two minutes before
we get started

Luis sits down across from
RIQUELME
(reaches with his cuffed
hands touches the boy)
Hijito

Luis is very uncomfortable seeing his father like this
RIQUELME (contd)
You came with Anita

LUIS
Yes

The hallway outside has become animated as the court
proceeding is about to get underway

RIQUELME
I want you to know that I’m very
sorry about this About failing
you

LUIS
You never failed me

RIQUELME
I was never there--

LUIS
You were always there Always

This comforts Riquelme

RIQUELME
Please tell me you’re going to stay
with Anita Promise me you’1ll try

Luis can’t answer And Riquelme tries one last time to reach
him

RIQUELME (to be improved) (contd)
-When you were little After your
mother left and we were all alone
I didn’t know how was going to
Manage with a small boy and no
money No regular job I hada
lot anger inside me But the
thing the one thing that helped me
get over all that was you Being
able to take care of you and love
you You’re the most important
thing in this world to me hijito
And I -- That’s why I had you For
me For me For a reason to live

LUIS
Yeah
(Beat)
I been thinkin’that song I
remembered it

RIQUELME
-the song
LUIS
Yeah You used to sing it when I
was little

There’s a pause Then unexpectedly Luis begins to sing the
little ditty

LUIS (contd)
Yo le dije al zapatero que me
hiciera unos zapatos con un
piquito redondo como lo tienen los
patos -- Malaia zapatero como me
engagno me hice los zapatos pero
el piquito no --

RIQUELME
-- Malaia zapatero como me
engagno me hice los zapatos pero
el piquito no

-- Which means whether we choose to translate it or not “I
told the shoemaker to make me some shoes with a rounded tip
like a duck Damn shoemaker he made me the shoes but
without the tip”

ANGLE ON THE LAWYER
poking his head back in the room

GABE WETTENAL
I’m sorry Mr Riquelme we have to
go right now Then calling our case
number

RIQUELME
(flustered tries to
finish his thought)
Luis you have to promise me you’1ll
try to live with AnitaPlease
try Please give the new school a
chance Promise --

A COURT OFFICER meanwhile enters and promptly raises
Riquelme out of his chair takes him away from

But Luis shouts over him as he’s taken away Luis is crying
now barely able to contain his emotions

LUIS
-- You promise me You promise me
youre comin’ back Don’t leave me
alone You promise me You
promise me you’re coming home

And then he watches his father enter the court as our sound
fades out to MOS

of the packed courtroom Efficiently carrying out its
functions MOS shots of various cases and motions The
judge hearing oral arguments mouthing rulings conferring at
the sidebar with attorneys Witnesses on the stand
testifying Men and women all ages being deported for all
kinds of reasons fair and unfair We watch all of this in
silence so as to minimize the pathos until it’s time for

RIQUELME
to stand before the judge at his pre-hearing Wettenal
exchanges some preliminary words with the judge and then we
fade back in the sound at the fateful moment when
JUDGE WINTER
It’s the court’s understanding Mr

Riquelme that do you not wish to
contest this motion for removal

CLOSE SHOT OF RIQUELME
turning around and spotting
ANITA

in one corner of the packed court room She nods to her
brother with tears in her eyes

in the other corner of the courtroom The boy locks eyes with
his father letting him know that he’s going to try

JUDGE WINTER (contd)
Mr Riquelme

WETTENAL

My client does not contest the

ANGLE ON A WHITE SCHOOL BUS idling beside the prison’s side

RIQUELME
emerges followed by several other fresh deportees All of
them dressed back in their regular clothes Free of

shackles

The men walk towards the bus along a barbed-wired fence
which separates them from

THEIR FAMILIES

on the other side We see Luis and Anita standing at the
fence peering through at

RIQUELME
who stops to looks at them He doesn’t smile or wave But
something in his eyes communicates that his spirit has not
been destroyed That he’s going to be okay As long as
LUIS
is okay The boy stares back at his father resolutely until
PRISON GUARD

Let’s go Keep moving
Riquelme gets on the bus and
LUIS and ANITA
walk slowly over towards the visitor parking lot Anita

places her arm around the boy’s shoulder A simple healing
motherly gesture witnessed by
