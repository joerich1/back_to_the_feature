Poker turns and gives Street a hateful look as he is dragged
away Street could care less

Street and Hondo cross back to-the sedan and get in
Hondo turns the car around and drives away

the setting sun This day has forever cemented them together
as a team Street about to turn on the radio Hondo gives
him a look
