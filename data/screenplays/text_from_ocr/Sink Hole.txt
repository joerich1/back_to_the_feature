OVER BLACK

Title Card Hydraulic Fracturing or ‘fracking a new and
environmentally devastating process of extracting natural gas
from rock beds deep in the ground while injecting a
combination of up to 600 kinds of chemicals into the Earth

Over 40000 gallons of this chemical fluid are used per
fracturing

These chemical fluids are unregulated and do not require any
kind of public disclosure

EXT FRACKING SITE NORTHERN PENNSYLVANIA -- DAY

The FRACKING SITE is set within once rich farmland now
barren Angry chants and signs reading “Fracking Kills Our
Land as a small crowd of LOCALS protest while SITE WORKERS
prepare to set-off underground EXPLOSIVES

BOOOOOM The ground shakes then settles everything seems
routine

Across the site a TECHNICIAN takes readings Suddenly he
stumbles finding the ground beneath his feet unexpectedly
SOFT

Bemused his next step sinks his foot even lower-- a dawning
realization as the technician’s expression turns to panic

He sprints as fast as he can as the ground beneath him begins
to give way the radius quickly rippling outward

The technician LEAPS as the ground under his feet caves-in
narrowly landing on the cusp of firm ground now behind him
a GIANT SINK-HOLE spanning a 50 yard circumference

Moments later bewildered workers stand on the edge of the
precipice the dark pit seems to swallow light giving no
indication of how deep it goes

Further into the abyss until we too are swallowed by the
darkness

MATCH CUT TO

BLACKNESS

POV slowly FADE-UP to a vivid blue sky TWO BLURRY FACES
lean in their mouths moving but voices muted as if
underwater
Then vision sharpens sound returns to normal Yelling and
cheers of a SMALL CROWD are heard

BLAKE
(to POV)
Get up man come on
(lower )
This is embarrassing bro You
can’t start freshmen year like
this

LEAH
Come on John Kick his ass This
guy’s a douche-hole

EXT PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

ANGLE ON JOHN HALLET lying flat on his back his left
eye already turning purple Blake and Leah hoist John to his
feet shoving him back into a

RING OF KIDS all graduated 8th graders headed into their
freshmen year of high school in the fall

Waiting for John in the center of the ring is KEVIN RALSTON pre-varsity jock Knows he’s hot shit

Weaving throughout the crowd is TAKA IGUCHI a small
feisty Asian boy hustling his peers and taking bets tongue
as quick as it is sharp Always wears a back-pack

Back in the ring John cowers literally dwarfed by Kevins
enormous shadow John is no match but worse has no
confidence in himself

The fight continues John’s friends cheer him on in vain as
the rest of the crowd screams for more blood As Kevin
pummels John wont even try to fight back just takes the
blows

The fight wraps up Kevin kicks John’s feet out from under
him sending him to the ground once again

KEVIN
(sneering)
You’re such a pussy Hallet

Kevin laughs and walks away toward applause and cheers Once
again Leah and Blake lean over John

LEAH
Holy shit man Look at your face
LEAH VAN GALDER smack in the middle of blossoming from
awkward child into pretty young woman though she is
blissfully oblivious The Peter Pan of tomboys

BLAKE
John you alright buddy

BLAKE WELLS disproportionately confident lovably
obnoxious A toothpick always behind his ear never without
his leather motorcycle jacketeven in summer

John groans Everything hurts

JOHN
Just help me up

EXT PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

John begrudgingly watches Kevin Ralston walk away with an
entourage of buddies and pretty girls high-fives all around

LEAH
Screw that guy You’1l show that
ass-face next time

BLAKE
Lady Language

LEAH
I ain’t no lady

BLAKE
Clearly

JOHN
There’s gonna be a ‘next time’

BLAKE
Guys like us there’s always gonna
be a ‘next time’

John’s shoulders sink Nearby Taka collects and pays out the
gamblers in the crowd then makes his way over to John
Blake and Leah

TAKA
(approaching)
“One for the money two for the
bitches three to get ready and
four to throw the--
(sees John)
Holy shit Dude Your face
LEAH

JOHN
Yeah yeah

John is in no mood for high spirits

TAKA
Sorry about your money maker
Johnny But I come bearing gifts

BLAKE
Alright what’s our take

Taka takes inventory of various items in hand

TAKA
Well we got eleven dollars cash
a gift card to ‘Everything Bagels’
and one very rare near mint
Charizard Ex with energy flame

He holds up the Pokemon card proudly

JOHN
‘The Hell guys You bet against
me

BLAKE

Come on John don’t take it
personally I mean blame physics
Kevin Ralston is like the biggest
person on the planet

John huffs and begins walking away The others follow
BLAKE (CONT’D)
Listen don’t sweat it man We’re
done with that middle-school shit
Monday high school starts No one
will care you got your ass kicked

JOHN
Just leave me alone

John picks up his step leaving the others behind

INT JOHN’S HOUSE -- LATER

John walks in through the front door still carrying his
defeat His home is middle-class sterile devoid of warmth
INT KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

John enters wordless His father RICHARD quiet and
meek sits at the table reading A good but oblivious man
a permanent somberness to him

Richard finally notices Kevin’s face

RICHARD
John are you OK

JOHN
Yeah

John grabs a pack of peas from the freezer

RICHARD
Is it the boys at school

JOHN
Nah Fell off my bike

RICHARD
(smiling)
Oh ok then

Richard goes back to his paper John exits

INT JOHN’S ROOM -- LATER

John stares at a framed family photo his dad MOM and John His look says it all momisn’t around anymore

He presses the bag of peas to his face and hangs his head
The quietness is heartbreaking

SMACK Something hits his window John turns as-- SMACK
there it is again He opens his window leaning out

On his lawn below are Taka Blake and Leah-- Blake holds a
bag of bagels

JOHN
Did you just throw a bagel at my
window

LEAH

Come on I got something that will
cheer you up

JOHN
I don’t wanna be cheered up
Blake flings up another bagel hitting John in head
BLAKE
Come on dork We’re not doing this
without you

JOHN
You bet against me

LEAH
This will make up for it I swear

John smiles if nothing else he has true friends

INT LEE’S PHARMACY -- LATER

Down the medicine aisle in the old momandpop pharmacy Leah
cleans John’s eye using supplies right off the shelf

JOHN
Ow

Leah coarsely jabs small skin abrasions with a cotton swab

LEAH
God you are a pussy
JOHN
Let’s see YOU take a punch to the
face
LEAH
(suddenly crestfallen)
I have

John struggles for words when he is saved

DEPUTY DAN WELLS local law and Blake’s brother rounds
the aisle bee-lining straight for John He sports a tan
Stetson hat

At the same time Blake and Taka round the other end of the
aisle-- both with arms full of junk food

TAKA
Well howdy there Sheriff

JOHN
I’m the deputy Taka you know
that

TAKA
Oh right Just the deputy
Blake and Taka snicker they don’t take Wells too seriously

BLAKE
Mom make you wear that hat

WELLS
(sharp to Blake)
Lay off the hat

WELLS (CONTD)

(to John
Word is you were in a fight I
can’t have fighting in my town

Blake does a decent impression of Alan Rickman

BLAKE
Fighting Fighting is the stuff of
boorish thugs and riff-raff

JOHN
Please stop doing Alan Rickman
It’s getting really weird now

BLAKE
I can go back to my Tony Montana
phase

EVERYONE
NO

JOHN

(turn to Wells)
I don’t think it was technically
‘fighting’

TAKA
He’s right Johnny got his ass
handed to
(off John’s look)
Sorry

WELLS
Don’t get smart I mean it
whatever you boys need to settle
you do it with words There are
other ways to stand up for
yourself

JOHN
But only one way anyone respects

WELLS
You need to first respect yourself
John’s shoulders drop-- he definitely doesn’t do that

BLAKE
Come on Dan lay off Stop trying
so hard to be a dick

Wells shoots Blake a glare grabs his elbow curbing him
aside

WELLS

I get what you’re doing you’re
thirteen you wanna show off in
front of your friends But this is
my job-- you know I wanna be
sheriff someday Outside of the
house you need to set an example
to others and start taking me
seriously

BLAKE
You once farted in your hand and
clamped it over my mouth

WELLS
That was a long time ago

BLAKE
That was Tuesday

Beat Wells turns looks at all the rest of the kids

WELLS
No more fighting

Wells walks off
BLAKE
(after)
No more of that hat
EXT MAIN STREET -- LATER
The kids walk to a bike rack un-hitch their bikes
JOHN
So where exactly are we going and

what is this ‘surprise’

LEAH
Youll see

Taka checks his iPhone
TAKA
Hey you guys get the Facebook
invite for Jeni Bell’s sisters

senior why would we be invited to
that

JOHN

anything

BLAKE

LEAH

therapist

JOHN
How do you even remotely think

into a high school party

BLAKE
Former eighth-graders We can
reinvent ourselves in high school

LEAH
I like us just fine

TAKA
And I like you baby

Leah rolls her eyes

JOHN
No one can change who they are

John takes off on his bike the rest follow

EXT TOWN OF ROSCOE -- DAY

Our gang weaves through the streets of ROSCOE a modest blue-
collar town where the years have been hard

EXT TRAIN TRACKS -- LATER

Ditching their bikes by the tracks the kids head into the
woods

JOHN
Are we going where I think we’re
going

EXT WOODS -- LATER

The gang come upon an old CLUB HOUSE long since left to the
elements

TAKA
Haha The house that Pixy Stix
built I lost my virginity in
there

LEAH
Maybe to your sock

TAKA
What did you think I meant

BLAKE
(re club house)
It looks smaller

LEAH
We’re just bigger

JOHN
Man I haven’t been here since we
were ten

INT CLUBHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Cramming in the four sit on the floor of their old haunt

BLAKE
How were we ever this tiny

LEAH
Remember when we used to think this
was a mansion

TAKA
(to Leah)
Remember when I showed you my dick
in here when we were eight

LEAH
I’m sure it hasn’t gotten any
bigger

Taka moves to unzip his pants Leah pulls back a fist

LEAH (CONT’D)
You want me to make it even
smaller

TAKA
Chill woman chill

JOHN
This is great but what are we
doing here

LEAH
A little organic therapy for what
ails you my friend

On that Leah unfurls a zip-lock bag containing about 40z
MARIJUANA Taka and Blake cheer

JOHN
Holy shit

BLAKE
We’re gonna be in high school
‘better start acting like high
schoolers

LEAH
We wanted to do it together

JOHN
I don’t know

TAKA
First time for everything Johnny
It’s either with us or in some
creepy guy’s van who picked you up
hitchhiking At least ours won’t be
laced with PCP

JOHN
Why are those the only two
scenarios

Blake throws his arm around John
BLAKE

Come on buddy Let’s forget all
the shit that’s bothering you

of

John looks around at his eager friends-- well when in Rome

INT CLUB HOUSE -- LATER

The world’s worst rolled JOINT is timidly passed amongst the
group Blake attempts a weak drag coughing immediately

BLAKE
Dude I totally feel it

LEAH
No you don’t You’re doing it
wrong

BLAKE

How do YOU know

JOHN
Where did you even get this

BLAKE
1 swear I feel something

LEAH
(answering John)
Justin my brother

Leah is passed the joint

BLAKE
The ‘pride of Roscoe’

LEAH
Hey That’s my brother
(Leah tries to inhale)
But yeah he’s a total burnout

Leah coughs badly The joint goes to John
JOHN
How are you supposed to even do
this

Taka snatches the joint out of John’s hand

TAKA
Watch and try to learn something

Taka takes a deep drag holding it in suppressing the reflex
to cough Several seconds go by before he exhales

BLAKE
Now that’s some Obi-Wan shit right
there

TAKA

And that’s how you do it to it

JOHN
I don’t even wanna know

TAKA
Rap music Everything I know I
learned from rap music

Confidence renewed the gang try hitting the joint again

EXTINT CLUB HOUSE -- LATER

Various inserts of the circle of friends goofing off
laughing and generally being high-as-balls

INT CLUB HOUSE -- LATER

John and Leah sit alone devouring bags of chips and cookies
Blake and Taka are elsewhere

JOHN
You know
LEAH
What’s that
JOHN
‘Funyons’ are awesome
LEAH
(laughs)

You’re high

JOHN
Hahayeah

Beat

JOHN (CONTD)
I lied When I said I hadn’t been
here since I was ten I came here a
lot especially after the
funeral Just sit for hours II
just didn’t want to be home That
place is a tomb

LEAH
I know you did
JOHN
What You do
LEAH
Yeah I’d come here for the same
reason to not be home Sometimes

I’d come and see you in here first

JOHN
Why didn’t you ever say anything

LEAH
Dunno Sometimes I wanted to
but I guess I just didn’t

JOHN
Oh

LEAH
Yeah

Suddenly Blake appears in the clubhouse window
BLAKE
HEY GUYS

JOHN
Gahhh Why are you shouting

BLAKE

SOUNDS LIKE I’M UNDERWATER

LEAH
No more drugs for that guy

JOHN

BLAKE
HE’S NOT WITH YOU

John dryly looks around the eight foot by eight foot space

JOHN
Yeah Doesn’t seem to be here

LEAH
Shit everyone have their socks
BLAKE
WELL WHERE IS HE

EXT TREE LINE -- TWILIGHT

Taka wanders aimlessly through the woods in his own world

Suddenly he HALTS staring disdain washing over him

TAKA
Son of a bitch

Moments later Blake John and Leah come running up

JOHN
Dude where’ve you been

TAKA
Check it out

ANGLE ON the OMNI-TECH FRACTURE-DRILLING SITE (as seen in

the opening) The workers have all gone home
Equal looks of contempt mirror Taka’s

TAKA (CONTD)
These shitheads ruined everything

BLAKE
Dad’s out of work ‘cuz of these
assholes

JOHN

Whole town is

LEAH
You know red water comes out of my
facet now because of them Red I

JOHN
You know what would be super
awesome Teaching them a lesson

TAKA
I’m liking where this is going

BLAKE
And what lesson is that

JOHN
Dont screw with Roscoe

EXT FRACKING SITE -- EVENING

As the evening sets in the gang goes about childishly
VANDALIZING the fracking site

Blake and John push over a row of Port-a-Potties Leah hurls
mud-pies at office-trailer windows Taka opens his backpack
revealing cans of SPRAY-PAINT

LATER

Blake and Taka stare at something off-screen arms folded
extremely satisfied

Leah joins them looks at her muddy hands-- discreetly wipes
them on Taka then sees what they’re both gazing at

LEAH
Nice

Taka smiles smugly Spray-painted on the cab of a huge
fracking drill in large lettering Omnitech-- SUCK A PUBE

JOHN (0S)
Hey you guuuuuys

They turn in the direction of John’s call from the far end of
the site

MOMENTS LATER

The rest join John by the mysterious SINK-HOLE (created in
the opening)

BLAKE
Whoais that from the drilling

JOHN
No fracking is a surgical
procedure My dad learned all about
it before they decided not to hire
locals This is something else

LEAH
How deep do you think it goes

BLAKE
Only one way to find out throw
Taka in

TAKA

Har-har

Taka moves forward producing a large flashlight from his
back-pack but the powerful beam is swallowed by the dark

TAKA (CONTD)
Hellooo000000000000

Taka’s voice echoes down The kids stare into the abyss
transfixed then

TAKA (CONTD)
You guys hear that

LEAH
Hear what

TAKA
Listen

The kids strain their ears Suddenly soft at first then
quickly growing louder closer a scratching noise

JOHN
W-What is that

LEAH
Something’s coming

TAKA
It’s getting closer

The kids slowly back away from the edge of the pit but their
eyes remain glued waiting

Suddenly a small shadow emerges on the cusp of the hole
Taka shines a light on

A CREATURE about the size of a large raccoon but covered in
short translucent hair By its wide-set eyes and small
face it’s clear this is a youngling

The creature freezes milky wide-eyes caught in Taka’s beam
It sniffs the air toward the gang

BLAKE
Uck gross What the shit is that

JOHN
Is that like a mole or something

TAKA
Yeah if a mole had sex with an old
man’s ball-sack

LEAH
It’s kinda cute

BLAKE
Typical girl

Leah STOMPS on Blake’s foot-- he yelps She then slowly
begins moving towards the creature hand outstretched

LEAH
Hey buddy

JOHN
Leah what are you doing You’re
gonna get rabies

LEAH
It doesn’t have rabies

JOHN
It doesn’t NOT have rabies

As Leah approaches the small creatures cowers submissively

LEAH
Don’t worry I won’t hurt you

Leah reaches out to pet the creature it pulls away but then
finally lets Leah pat its head

LEAH (CONTD)
Hey theresee it’s ok

JOHNBLAKETAKA
AWWWWWWWW

LEAH
(turns to the guys)
Seehe’s harmle--

Suddenly the creature CATAPULTS ONTO LEAHS BACK She
screams reeling aroundbut the guys scream even more
girlyhigh-pitch than Leah

LEAH (CONTD)
Help me assholes

The boys fluster a few more seconds then--

JOHN
Ok ok

John gingerly attempts to help as the creature claws at
Leah’s hair she wiggles out of her top-layer shirt wraps it
around the creature

LEAH
Here

Leah frantically jams the balled-up creature into John’s
arms John yelps-- on reflex he heaves the creature into a
nearby tree-trunk

SMACK The creature hits hard falling to the ground

The gang cautiously approaches the bundle-- it’s not moving

TAKA
Is it dead

John reaches out peeling back the shirt revealing a
BLOODY PULPY MESS the creature’s head completely bashed in
The gang reels back in shock and disgust

AWWWWWWWWWWW

LEAH
What did you do

JOHN
Me I saved your life

LEAH
Pfft I hardly think so

John turns to Taka and Blake for validation

BLAKE
You didn’t have to murder it John

Taka just shakes his head in disdain

JOHN
Unbelievable

The gang goes in for a second look

TAKA
What the hell is it

LEAH
We need to tell someone

BLAKE
I should report this to my brother

JOHN
Oh right Your brother who needs a
good bust to help towards that
sheriffs badge Like busting the
kids who trashed this place

They look back at the vandalized site ‘oh right’

JOHN (CONTD)
So we’re agreed None of this
happened

ALL
Yesyuptotally

LEAH
Well I can’t go home like this

Leah is covered in dirt scratches and a little blood

TAKA
I said I’d drop by Cameron’s
tonight for a little DandD-- he
doesn’t live far-- you can get
cleaned up there

LEAH
Oh god “Cameron”

TAKA
Whatever you guys won’t play DandD
with me

BLAKE

I wonder why
As gang begins to walk off CAMERA PANS slowly back over to
the gaping hole as we approach the CUSP another noise
emanates from its depths only MUCH bigger
EXT CAMERONS FRONT STEP -- LATER

The door opens geek-personified Cameron grins widely
dressed in medieval cos-play like something out of LOTR

CAMERON
‘What-up Sir Rowan the Long-Penis

TAKA
Greetings Ulric the Motor-Boater

John Blake and Leah raise an eyebrow at Taka

TAKA (CONTD)
What they’re our DandD names
(to Cameron)
Hope you don’t mind I brought my
boys--
(off Leah’s glare)
--and one girl Sort of

Cameron grins slickly at Leah with misplaced confidence

CAMERON
S’up Van Galder you need some
rescuing
TAKA
She actually needs to use your
shower
Cameron’s jaw drops
CAMERON

(voice cracks)
Ohumyeah ahem Totally cool
Come on in guys

TAKA
(aside to Leah)
Id check the shower for cameras

INT LIVING ROOM -- LATER

Taka Cameron and two other friends ANDY and BRIAN all
in cos-play attire sit around the kitchen table a DandD game
in full-swing

John and Blake dryly observe by the kitchen counter

CAMERON
-no no no Its a plus four to
‘crit in that situation

TAKA
Still a bullshit piece of loot

CAMERON
Youre going to end up rolling my
Vorpal Blade from your elf-born
corpses face

TAKA
(to Blake and John)
This is why you never DM

JOHN

BLAKE
Where are you going

JOHN

BLAKE

John shrugs as he exits Blake whips a handful of MandMs
BLAKE (CONTD)

Traitor
INT CAMERON’S BEDROOM -- LATER
John knocks then enters the bedroom Leah towels her damp
hair dressed in jeans and a t-shirt that says “Good to Go
with a ‘downward pointing arrow’ beneath the words
And suddenly John is looking at Leah in a whole new light

without the layers of boyish clothes and dirt washed away
for the first time Leah looks like a girl

JOHN
Uh hi

LEAH
Oh hey

JOHN

You lookbetter

LEAH
Thanks
(re tshirt)
It’s Cameron’s You do NOT want to
know what he keeps in his sock

drawer
JOHN
(still dazed)
Uh-huh

Awkward silence

LEAH
Soococooce what’s up

JOHN
I was just uh making sure you

LEAH
Ohthanks

Leah goes back to toweling her hair as John tries to avoid
staring-- but fails

LEAH (CONTD)
Yeah

JOHN
Er nothing

LEAH
Youre acting weird

JOHN
(covering)
It’s probably the weed

LEAH
Oh right

INT LIVING ROOM -- LATER

Blake has somehow gotten convinced to join the game he
reluctantly takes a growing interest evening wears a cape
He absentmindedly spins a 20 sided die on the table

BLAKE
So Ill just make aI dont know
power-mad thunder god I can do
that right

CAMERON
NO you can’t just “do” that

BLAKE
You said this game was awesome
because you could do and be
anything

TAKA
You need permission from the
Dungeon Master and a whole lot of
natural twenties to be a god

BLAKE
Im wearing a cape That should be
enough KNEEL

The boys start arguing the rules

EXT FRACKING SITE -- NIGHT

The vandalized site lays dark and quiet CAMERA drifts over
to the small creature’s REMAINS lying in Leah’s shirt

FROM WITHIN THE HOLE

POV rushing toward visible night sky Moments later the POV
breaks up onto the--

SURFACE
POV rising abnormally high-- much taller than a grown human
SNIFFING SOUNDS as the POV “drops” as if going down onto

four legs The POV rushes toward the small creature

WIDE SHOT of the fracking site-- too wide to discern anything
specific but what we HEAR is all too clear

A guttural howling cry of ANGUISH no human could make

INT LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

The boys are still arguing over DandD rules when the faintest
ECHO OF THE HOWL reaches Blake’s ears who sits closest to
the patio door Blake cranes his head around not sure if he
heard something

TAKA (0S)
Hey-- hey douche-bag

Blake turns back around

TAKA (CONTD)
Ha You looked It’s your roll

Blake hesitates turns back to the patio door weary but
hears nothing more turns back to the game
EXT TRAIN TRACKS -- LATER

A lone Camaro sits parked next to the train tracks

INT JUSTIN’S CAMARO -- CONTINUOUS

Inside the Camaro JUSTIN Leah’s older stoner brother
his buddy CHET sits shotgun currently blazing up

Chet offers the joint to Justin who turns it down
preoccupied with digging through a small tote-bag

JUSTIN
Dude how much money do I have

Chet opens a brown paper sack reaching in thumbing a loose
stack of bills

CHET
Looks like 350

JUSTIN
I’m short on inventory We should
have 400

Justin casts an accusatory eye at Chet
CHET
(re his joint)
Don’t look at me man This is my

commission not a stem more

Justin thinks something dawning on him

JUSTIN
Shit Leah

CHET
Your sister She’s like four years
old

JUSTIN

She’s thirteen I caught her coming
out of my room this morning-- she
said she was just borrowing a book

CHET
You don’t own any books

JUSTIN
Yeah I’m realizing that When I
find that little bitch and I’m
going to--

WHOOSH A enormous black SHAPE gallops by the car but only
Chet sees it

CHET
HOLY CRAPPING SHIT
JUSTIN
(startled)

Jesus what the Hell man

Chet begins to point out the window but the black shape has
melted into the night Chet then looks at his joint

CHET
Dude this is some good shit
INT CAMERON’S BEDROOM -- LATER

Leah finishes cleaning up she catches John checking out her
butt John quickly averts his gaze covering up with a cough

Leah pretends she didn’t notice but smiles to herself

INT KITCHEN -- LATER
The DandD game in full swing Blake is completely immersed now
BLAKE
Ok bitches-- I envoke the ‘Time
Stop’ spell BOOM Hell yeah I
just dropped that shit
The rest of the table groans

CAMERON
He catches on fast

John and Leah enter

TAKA
Ococoocoh Where have you two been
JOHN
(aggressive)

Shut-it

Blake rolls the dice Lands on the number 20-- more cries
from the table

BLAKE
20 Eat it you unicorn-sucking
chumps I am your god now

As Blake prattles on John and Leah suddenly notice SOMETHING
beyond the patio door behind Blake

We do not see what they see The two stare frozen mouths
agape Blake finally notices their faces

BLAKE (CONT’D)
What

Blake turns along with the rest of the table

BLAKE (CONT’D)
(nonplussed)
Shit

Then Blake dodges out of the way just as--

CRASH A massive SHAPE shatters through the patio door
plowing through the kitchen table

At first we only get glimpses of the FORM amidst the melee of
scattering kids

Easily the size of a grizzly bear deep-set red eyes pale
pinkish wrinkled skin covered in tufts of the same kind of
translucent hair as the small creature earlier

Then a guttural ROAR that shakes the entire house-- T-Rex
aint got shit on this thing

The beast swings its mighty head from side to side and we
realize its eyes are not searching rather its NOSE sucks in
the air through huge nostrils-- it’s searching for ascent

Meanwhile the kids disperse through-out the house fleeing
from this new terror

SERIES Visceral gritty moments of individuals pairs or
trios of the friends RUNNING DUCKING and JUMPING out of the
path of the beast as it barrels through Camerons house
utterly destroying everything in its path

HALLWAY

The beast charges Andy and Brian as they dive around a corner
into the

FRONT ROOM
-but instead following their path the beast BURSTS THROUGH
THE DRYWALL of the front room But its thick neck gets

stuck in the wall’s support frame

Andy and Brian scream and instinctively start beating back
the beast’s snapping MAW with their cos-play prop swords

HALLWAY

The beast’s body juts out on the other side of the wall from
somewhere above PAINTBALLS begin pelting the beast’s torso

ANGLE ON Cameron perched mid-way on the staircase

CAMERON
HEY ASSHOLE

The beast pulls back through the wall craning its head up
Cameron suddenly realizes he’s only pissed it off more

CAMERON (CONTD)
Oh no

Cameron drops the paintball gun and bombs up the steps as the
beast forgets Andy and Brian and gives chase to Cameron

As the beast ascends the staircase COLLAPSES under its
weight entangling the beast in a mess of planks Roaring in
frustration it flops and flounders trying to gain footing
ELSEWHERE

John Blake Taka and Leah have re-grouped

BLAKE
What is that thing

TAKA
It’s looking for us

LEAH
Wha How--

TAKA
Look familiar Like a BIGGER
version of that thing John killed
earlier

JOHN
Don’t blame this on me

LEAH
Did we kill its baby

BLAKE
Oh this is fan-TAS-tic

LEAH
We need to get out of here

John gets an idea

JOHN
Come on I have a plan

John leads them back through the kitchen

INT HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

The beast finally twists up-right in what’s left of the
staircase no sooner ACTION FIGURES bombard the creature
from above

ANGLE ON Cameron perched atop the upstairs floor He hurls
his designer action-figure collection at the beast

ANGLE ON a SUPERMAN figure in Cameron’s hand
CAMERON
(to figure)
For Krypton Kal-El
With a somber face Cameron takes deadly aim and chucks the
figure sending ‘Superman’ literally flying toward the
beast
and bouncing harmlessly off its thick hide
The beast cranes its head up towards a flummoxed Cameron

then lets loose its loudest ROAR yet sending Cameron flying
backward

INT GARAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

John Blake Taka and Leah fall over themselves cramming
into Cameron’s parent’s SUV

INT SUV -- CONTINUOUS

John settles into the driver’s seat Blake shotgun Taka and
Leah are a tangled mess in the back

BLAKE
Wait what are we doing

JOHN
We pull up out front honk like
hell to get that thing’s attention
and get it out of the house No way
it can catch us in this

BLAKE
Yeah but do you know how to
drive

JOHN
Oh Uh

LEAH

(rolls her eyes)
Oh my god we’re going to die

Taka starts climbing into the front seat

JOHN
What are you--

TAKA
Move over I can drive

JOHN BLAKE
No you can’t Since when

Taka’s butt smacks Blake in the face John tries to move
around Taka but it’s a mess of bodies and seat-belts

LEAH
Yup We’re dead
JOHN
(to Taka)
Would you just let me move first
TAKA
You go over my shoulder I’1ll go

here
Several extended beats of this ‘true achievement’ in human
coordination Finally Taka settles into the driver’s seat
John in the back with Leah

TAKA (CONTD)
Ok Where are the keys

Beat Everyone looks at each other

INT KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

The door to the garage cracks open as Taka peers into
Camerons kitchen He zeros-in on a set of CAR KEYS hanging
from a hook next to the refrigerator

Tip-toe’ing across the kitchen Taka reaches the set of hooks
and gently lifts the car keys off Smiles to himself

Then he senses it before he looks up-- and into the RED EYES
of the beast now standing right in front of him

Suddenly the beast hoists up on its back two legs towering
a good ten feet above Taka his face drops as he stares back

TAKA
I promise I will never touch weed
again

The beast roars crashing back down on all fours taking out
the kitchen counter in the act as Taka bolts for the garage

INT GARAGE -- MOMENTS

Taka flies out the door and DIVES through the passenger
window He writhes across Blake’s lap managing to jam the
key into the ignition cranking it

BLAKE
What are you doing

Still flat across Blake’s lap feet out the window Taka
slithers down to the gas-peddle face-first

TAKA
TAKE THE WHEEL

JOHN
Wha--

Taka jams transmission into REVERSE with one hand then SLAMS
the gas pedal down with other

The SUV peels back wildly as the beast CRASHES THROUGH the
wall of the house and into the garage

The kids scream as the car plows back THROUGH the closed
garage door and into the driveway John reaches up from the
backseat to steady the wheel as the car peels back into the
street

John cranks the wheel at the last second to prevent from
going into the ditch but takes out the neighbor’s mailbox

BLAKE JOHNLEAH
BRAKE

Taka hits the brake with his other hand and the car jolts to
a halt throwing everyone around

Taka finally manages to right-himself in the driver’s seat

TAKA
(suave)
Ill take it from here

BLAKE JOHNLEAH
GO

It’s a stretch (re his short legs) but Taka’s foot slams
down on the gas pedal and the car peels out--

-- barely getting out of the way in time to avoid being T-
Boned by the charging beast A near miss

INT SUV -- MOMENTS LATER

Taka adjusts the seat as far forward as it can go

TAKA
So this is driving

Leah looks out the back window

LEAH
How fast does this thing go

TAKA
Why

LEAH
You’re going to need to go a lot
faster

Taka adjusts his rear-view mirror as everyone else turns back
to see

ANGLE ON The beast charging down the street like a freight-
train moments away from--

SLAM The beast rams its head into the back of the SUV like
a rhino the force lifting the car off its back wheel The
kids SCREAM

JOHN
PUNCH IT TAKA

TAKA
HANG ON

Taka slams on the gas gripping the wheel as the SUV quickly
pulls away He hits the radio blasting a POP SONG

TAKA (CONTD)

The others join Taka in yelling but out of sheer terror

BLAKE
We gotta lose it

JOHN
Yeah ‘ya think

VARIOUS Taka takes a number of sharp turns down various
neighborhood streets in attempt to out-runlose the beast

With each jolting sloppy turn the kids oddly seem to forget
they are being pursued and instead start to enjoy the ride
as if it were a roller-coaster
INT SUV -- MOMENTS LATER
Through the rear window the beast is no where in sight
LEAH
I think we lost it
INTEXT SUVCAR -- MOMENTS LATER
The SUV pulls up to an intersection next to another CAR
The DRIVER (50s) glances over at the SUV to see tiny Taka
behind the wheel Taka turns his head sees the other driver
and breaks into a wide grin giving the ‘thumbs up’
Second later Taka floors it through the intersection to the
bewilderment of the other driver
INT SUV -- MOMENTS LATER
Leah looks out through the front windshield
LEAH
Dude Kevin Ralston’s house is
coming up

JOHN
So

Leah just smiles

EXT FRONT LAWN -- NIGHT

Kevin Ralston (the bully from John’s fight) and a FRIEND
throw a football between each other

Suddenly the SUV blazes by-- and an empty SODA CAN pelts
Kevin’s face as the SUV runs over his mailbox

Kevin barely gets a glimpse of Leah leaning out the window
giving him the double birdie as the car speeds past

LEAH
SUCK IT PENIS BREATH

Kevin is too stunned to react only watches as the SUV’s tail-
lights turn the corner

INT SUV -- MOMENTS LATER
Blake and Taka high-five Leah

BLAKE
That was AWESOME

JOHN
Why did you do that

LEAH
‘Cause that guy’s an asshole No
one fucks with my friends

John smiles but knows a girl just stood up for him when he
couldn’t

BLAKE
(to Taka)
Hey you might want to slow down I
think we lost that thing a while
ago

Taka brings the SUV down to a manageable cruising speed

LEAH
So what now

BLAKE
Do we tell anyone about this one

JOHN
It’s still all going to lead back
to us vandalizing the fracking
site

LEAH
It’s Omni-Tech’s fault All their
‘fracking around probably disturbed
the thing to begin with
TAKA
Well since we already have a car
lets roll by Jeni Bell’s place
Remember her sister’s having that
big party

LEAH
Yes the one none of us were
invited to

JOHN
After all that’s happened tonight

TAKA

JOHN

LEAH
Whatever I’m up for watching you

JOHN
Er I was actually thinking that
maybe you and I could go somewhe--

SLAM The car spins around a near 360 degrees as the BEAST
clips the bumper of the car at full-speed Inside the kids
scream as they’re tossed around
The beast turns heading for their car again
BLAKE JOHNLEAH
(to Taka)
GOOOOOO

Taka yells as he slams on the gas again the car burning
rubber as it peels out of the neighborhood

INTEXT SUV -- MOMENTS LATER

Leah looks out the back window the beast coming up fast

LEAH
Taka Go faster

TAKA
Do you think I’m joy-riding
EXT STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

The SUV takes a sharp turn out of the neighborhood and onto a
COUNTRY HIGHWAY

Leah and John dare to look out the back window again only
to see the beast is gone

BLAKE
Is it coming

JOHN
No where did it

LEAH
It’s gone

BLAKE
Did it give up

TAKA
Shit-yeah it did ‘Cuz I got some
Vin Diesel fast and furious shit up
in here--

CRUNCH The roof nearly CAVES IN as the beast lands on top
of the SUV All-out panic inside

The beast has a strong hold on the speeding SUV with one claw
gripping the roof it begins POUNDING DOWN with the other
The back windshield blows out under the force pieces of
safety glass flying everywhere

SMASH A CLAW punctures through the roof over Johns head

John LEAPS over onto Leah’s side falling into her and
suddenly finds himself with his HAND ON HER BOOB

John looks at his hand then at Leah then back to his
hand and quickly pulls his hand away

JOHN
Dude I am SO sorr---

SLAM The beast’s meaty claw punches completely through the
roof tearing out most of the seat where John just was

Slam Slam Slam The gape in the roof gets wider with each
hit-- glimpses of the beast’s dripping razor-filled maw
snapping down at them
John and Leah hold each other screaming
UP FRONT
TAKA
(to Blake)
Back-pack

BLAKE
What

Taka points desperately to his BACK-PACK at Blake’s feet

TAKA
Back-pack In the back-pack

Blake opens the back-pack digging through moments later he
pulls out a BAGEL Holds it up

TAKA (CONTD)
NO The flare-gun

Blake can barely hear Taka over the screams of John and Leah
as the roaring beast continues swiping at them

BLAKE
WHAT

TAKA
THE FLARE GUN

Blake dives back into the back-pack and produces a coast-
guard issued FLARE GUN He holds it up

TAKA (CONTD)
(re beast)
Shoot it

BLAKE
Why the hell do you have a flare gu-

BANG Blake accidently discharges the flare gun in the car

The red-hot FLARE bounces off the ceiling and onto the
driver’s side floor

Blake and Taka scream Taka begins SWERVING the car as he
tries to avoid his feetlegs from touching the blazing flare
EXT SUV -- CONTINUOUS

The beast is whipped around by Taka’s swerving but manages
to keep a grip with one claw

INT SUV -- MOMENTS LATER

TAKA
YOU IDIOT

In the back John and Leah are tossed around like rag-dolls

JOHN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

SLAM The beast’s claw swipes down through the hole in the
roof-- John pulls Leah out of the way at the last second
but the beast rears back preparing to strike again

Up front Blake looks out the windshield-- his eyes go WIDE

BLAKE
TAKA LOOK OUT

Taka looks up from the floorboard to see he’s drifted into
the oncoming lane A HUGE SEMI-TRUCK BARRELING DOWN ON THEM

The semi blares its horn-- the SUV only seconds away from
head-on impact

At the last possible moment Taka JERKS the wheel swerving
out of the semi’s path

THE SHARP MOMENTUM CATAPULTS THE BEAST OFF OF THE ROOF
- and INTO THE FRONT GRILL OF THE SEMI-TRUCK The creature

explodes disintegrating into bloody goey gore by the sheer
power of force-meets-weight

INT SUV -- MOMENTS LATER

In the rear-view mirror the semi slams on its brakes but
Taka has no intention of stopping himself

TAKA
Holy shit Did you see that

John Leah and Blake can’t believe it themselves nervous
laughter as relief slowly wash over them all

BLAKE
Holy shitHOLY SHIT HA

John and Leah sighsmile-- then John realizes he’s still
sitting in her lap He quickly moves back to his side

JOHN
Sorry

LEAH
Thanks for saving me I owe you

JOHN
No big deal

Up front Taka and Blake just roll their eyes
BLAKE

Taka you saved me You’re so
handsome and dreamy

TAKA
Blake your musk is intoxicating I
bet your balls smell like
Christmas

BLAKE
Ok dude you’re weird

JOHN
I’m going to kill you both

BLAKE

TAKA
Yeah thanks to me and my being

LEAH

BLAKE

JOHN
Taka pull over

TAKA
What Why

JOHN
Just pull over

Taka pulls off to the side of the road

JOHN (CONTD)
Ok state of the union In the last
three hours we’ve vandalized a
multi-million dollar fracking site
killed two ‘whatever-those-things-
were’ destroyed Cameron’s house
and totaled his parent’s car

TAKA
Well the last two were technically
that thing’s fault

JOHN
This is all gonna catch up with us
And soon We have to come up with
some kind of story

EXT CAMERON’S HOUSE -- LATER
Flashing red and blue lights illuminate Cameron’s front lawn

Two SHERIFF’S CARS an ambulance a fire-truck and a throng
of neighborhood onlookers gather on the front lawn

Cameron Andy and Brian wrapped in blankets excitedly

recall their recent encounter all at once
ANDY BRIAN
And then it came through the But we were like “Wrong day
wall and was like wrong guys to mess with
“ROOOOOOOAR” ‘mutha ‘fucka” And we were
all like “Slice Dice
Ninja”
CAMERON

And then it tried to come up the
stairs but I went all Gandalf with
that shit “You Shall Not Pass
Bitch

ANGLE ON Deputy Wells looking completely bewildered at the
three-man act unfolding in front of him

Moments later SHERIFF BRONSON (50s) gruff Michael Parks
type strides up-- equal bemusement at the prattling kids

BRONSON
(re kids)
Jesus We should just start
charging for tickets Tour the
country with this act

WELLS
I have no idea what’s happening
(consults small note-pad)
So far I’ve only picked-up
‘Elder’s Fire-Spell ‘Nards’
‘Bitch-be-trippin’ and ‘Scourge of
Carpathia’

Cameron silences the other two

CAMERON
(to Wells)
-l said it LOOKED like ‘The
Scourge of Carpathia’

Cameron holds up a Magic The Gathering card an illustration
of a monster but shares similar features to our beast size
build and teethclaws

BRONSON
Son you’re telling me this did
that to your house

CAMERON
Uh no
(waves card)
This isn’t real Officer But
something like it did

BRONSON
(rubbing his face)
This is why I’m “pro-choice”

WELLS

EXT FRACKING SITE -- NIGHT

The SUV-- or what’s left of it-- pulls up to the edge of the
fracking site The kids get out

LEAH
Ok this is stupid We’ve risked
enough tonight

John leads as the rest follow

JOHN
No one’s going to believe us we
get the smaller one to show as
proof

(MORE)

JOHN (CONTD)
Hell chances are its some big
science-y discovery anyway
Probably some endangered species

TAKA
Yeah they’1ll give us all peace-
prizes and forget that we trashed
this place

LEAH
I don’t think they give you peace-
prizes for that

JOHN
Well the other one is road-

BLAKE

BLAKETAKA
“Like a G6 like-a-G-sixnah-nah-

Blake and Taka badly chantdance to the ‘Far East Movement’
hit single while John and Leah forge ahead
INT JUSTIN’S CAMARO -- LATER

Justin and Chet are parked on the side of the road Sheriff
Bronson’s cruiser lights flashing behind them

Bronson strides up to the driver’s side window as Justin
rolls it down Chet wafts out lingering marijuana smoke out

JUSTIN
Uh hey Sheriff What can I do for--

BRONSON
Justin do you know where your
sister is

JUSTIN
Um no But I wanna know the same
thing

BRONSON

Why is that You know what she and
her little friends have been up to

JUSTIN
What do you mean

Bronson’s radio crackles

WELLS (VO)
Chuck do you read over

Bronson raises his radio

BRONSON
Copy

EXT HIGHWAY -- SIMULTANEOUS

Another set of fire-trucks curtain off one lane of the
highway road-flares surround the semi-truck and what looks
like the floor of a slaughter house all over the asphalt

WELLS
(into walkie)
I’m on highway 251 south of
Belvedere road Don’t know what
I’m looking at A semi truck hit
some kind of animal

BRONSON (V0O)
Like a deer

Wells looks down at the ground with a grim face

WELLS
I don’t think so

ANGLE ON the only intact piece of what’s left of the beast
a huge CLAWED APPENDAGE covered in translucent fur
EXT JUSTIN’S CAMARO -- SIMULTANEOUS

WELLS (VO)
You find the kids yet

BRONSON
Working on it Keep me updated if
your situation develops Out
Bronson leans back in through the driver’s side window
BRONSON (CONTD)
So take a guess as to where your
sister could be Think real hard
EXT FRACKING SITE -- NIGHT

The four kids stand leaning in staring down at “us”

BLAKE
Well that settles that

LEAH
Was it still alive
JOHN
Maybe someone else took it
TAKA
Is there a “plan B” Or any other

letter

REVEAL The four friends looking down a FLASHLIGHT
illuminating Leah’s tattered shirt absent of the small
creature they killed earlier

TAKA (CONTD)
Is there another way that we can
get rich quick I’m all about that
now

JOHN
Taka come on focus Who would’ve
taken it

BLAKE
Couldn’t be the cops they’d still
be here and calling Omnitech

LEAH
Maybe another animal ate it or
something Like a coyote

John sweeps the surrounding areaground with the flashlight
while the others continue to debate suddenly HIS EYES GO
WIDE

JOHN
Uh guys

At the same time the area lights up with flashing redandblue
lights All the kids turn as Sheriff Bronson pulls up

BLAKE
Oh shit

TAKA
So busted

LEAH

Stop being pussies and act cool

Leah composes herself Blake and Taka follow suit John’s
eyes remain on the ground

JOHN
Guys

Sheriff Bronson strolls up he notices all the toilet-paper
streaming across the site He shines his own flashlight on
the four guilty faces

BRONSON
(to Leah)
Found your bikes near the train
tracks

TAKA
(whispers)
Shit our bikes

Blake elbows him

BLAKE
Shhh

BRONSON
And this was in one of your
backpacks you left behind

Bronson holds up the bag of weed All the kids’ faces go
pale but Leah plays it cool

LEAH

Those aren’t our bikes Sheriff
BRONSON

Really Then how did you get out

here

Bronson then notices the destroyed SUV

BRONSON (CONTD)
What’s this now

LEAH
Uh

BRONSON
And you’re trespassing
(re vandalism)
That doesn’t happen to be your
handy work now is it

ALL
NOno waynigga pleaseno sir

BRONSON
You’re all in a lot of trouble

ON CUE John glances at the ground again trepidation
starting to show on his face

BRONSON (CONT’D)
Now before we get into anything
else I need to know what happened
at Cameron’s house

LEAH
Cameron

Bronson shines his flashlight right in Leah’s face
BRONSON
Start talking before you all dig
yourselves into a deeper hole

INSERT

POV from inside the giant sink-hole only a few yards away
Deep ominous breathing coming from within

BACK TO SCENE
BRONSON (CONTD)
Cameron said something about some
kind of animal attack Said it went
after you all What was it

The kids look between each other whats our story

TAKA
Listen Sheriff Bronson

BRONSON
Quiet ‘Short-Round’ I know the
racquets you run at your school-- I
don’t want any fast-talk I want
the truth

Bronson sizes up each of the kids trying to spot the
weakest his flashlight settles on John who nervously
glances back and forth from the ground

BRONSON (CONTD)
Hallet right

JOHN
Um yes sir

John peeks at his friends
- Blake gives him a reassuring nod and a thumbs-up
- Leah’s stern glare says ‘Dont admit anything’
- Taka mimes the ‘blow-job’ gesture trying to get a laugh
BRONSON
Son I want you to tell me what

happened Everything

JOHN
Ier

Again John glances at the ground
BRONSON
The answers ain’t written on your

shoes boy

JOHN
W-What’s going on

John looks at his friends an expression of panic
JOHN (CONTD)
What’s going on is there are two
sets of tracks
He shines his flashlight toward ground
JOHN (CONTD)

See there’s one set then there’s
anotherbigger

ANGLE ON Two sets of adult animal TRACKS covering the
ground One set the size of a bear the other easily the
size of a rhino

BRONSON

‘This that animal Cameron was
jawing on about Was it a mountain
lion Were you kids baiting a
mountain lion doing some Mtv shit
Gonna post it on Youtube to try to
get famous Do you know how
dangerous--

But the kids have stopped listening to Sheriff Bronson their
uniform gaze fixed above his head mouths agape

Off their looks-- Bronson stops talking then he hears it a
heavy wet breathing His hand slowly goes for the GUN on his
hip

Bronson slowly turns his head around to see--

JOHN
It’s “daddy”

ANGLE ON another beast similar to the prior but larger
bulkier with harder sharper features

Suddenly the beast rears up on its hind-legs-- easily twice
the size of the first

This is ALPHA BEAST

Bronson’s mouth falls open-- he already knows this hesitation
has cost him his life

BRONSON
Run

Bronson quickly tries to draw his gun as the Alpha drops
bearing its jaws right down on his head

But Bronson rolls out of the way firing three times into the
Alpha-- but the bullets barely penetrate its thick hide

BRONSON (CONTD)
I SAID RUN

The kids scream and scatter as Bronson squares off with the
Alpha

WITH THE KIDS

John Blake Taka and Leah sprint for the nearby TREELINE
More GUNSHOTS in the growing distance

JOHN
Don’t look back keep running

BACK WITH BRONSON
The Alpha throws its head knocking Bronson to the ground
his guns goes sailing The Alpha closes in on Bronson who

stands up defiantly

BRONSON
Eat shit

The Alpha roars swiping with its massive claw sending
Bronson’s entrails flying out of him
EXT FOREST -- MOMENTS LATER

Lungs burn Legs pump Backward glances eyes praying there
is nothing else coming

Leah drags behind then stops John sees her goes back He
waves Blake and Taka onward

JOHN
Go Get to the bikes
(turns to Leah)
Come on We can’t stop
Leah pants sharp short breaths

LEAH
II

JOHN
What I can’t understand--

LEAH
I--ninhaler

JOHN
Inhaler Ok where’s your inhaler

Leah just shakes her head as she continues to hyper-venilate
JOHN (CONTD)
You don’t have it Where-- crap--

it’s in your backpack

Leah nods

JOHN (CONTD)
We can’t stay here you have to--

ROOOOOOARRRRRRRR A deafening roar shakes the forest John
grips Leah

JOHN (CONTD)
Oh no

EXT FOREST -- MOMENTS LATER
Thudthudthud

Heavy footsteps quake the forest floor The Alpha beast dips
in and out of the moonlit shadows of the forest canopy its
snout sucks in the night air feverishly searching

NEARBY

POV the Alpha canvasing the area about fifty yards out

EXTINT CLUB HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

John and Leah flatten themselves on the tiny floor of the
clubhouse They watch the Alpha through a split in the wall

Leah tries to control her hyper-ventilating but to little
success John moves closer bringing her head to his chest

LEAH
(through gasps)
What are you

JOHN
(whispers)
Ssshhh slow it down Try to
match my breathing

LEAH
(labored)
Whatare yousome kind of
doctor now

JOHN
(bittersweet)
I used to have asthma too My mom
would do this with me when I was
younger It always worked

Leah is hesitant then lets herself sink into John’s embrace
begins to match the rise and fall of his chest After a few
moments she’s back to normal

LEAH
Do you miss her

Beat
JOHN
She made me feel invincible She

made me feelbig

They look out through the split in the wall the Alpha is
slowly plodding away in the opposite direction

The two friends smile but then realize their gaze is
lingering

--and suddenly that magical moment when you realize this
is it this is going to be your first kiss Then

LEAH
What is that

JOHN
Uh what

Leah looks down then looks up at John her face contorting
from delicate to horrified

LEAH

Do you have a boner
JOHN

I-I-I
LEAH

Oh gawd You perv

JOHN
Oh what Like what do you
expect I’m frickin’ thirteen OK
It’s just a thing your body does
like when your nipples get hard
(instant mental image)
Oh damn it

LEAH
Uck You’re so gross

JOHN
What do you think would happen when
were practically-

John stops himself

LEAH
UM practically what
JOHN
Er nothing nothing Ok I’m
sorry
(genuine)
Please I’m sorry
Beat
LEAH

I can still feel it

JOHN
Well what do you want me to do

LEAH
You can start by un-Jjamming your
little buddy out of my--
Suddenly Leah stops short so does John

They both turn their heads to find the long SNOUT of the
Alpha pressed through the window of the clubhouse

Beat
John and Leah scream
The Alpha rears up bearing down on the clubhouse just as

John and Leah scramble out the Alpha smashing their
childhood clubhouse to splinters

John clambers across the forest floor The Alpha charges
catching John under the legs with its snout like a bull
tossing him into the air

John yelps crashing back onto the ground he raises his
head coming face to face with the Alpha thick ropes of
saliva cascading from its black maw

The Alpha inhales sharply taking in John’s scent then as
if “confirming it’s him” roars again its slavering jaws
open wide

John squeezes his eyes tight preparing for end--

WHAM A club-sized tree BRANCH smashes into the Alpha’s nose
The Alpha bellows flailing back in pain

John opens his eyes as he’s yanked to his feet by Leah

LEAH (CONTD)
RUN
The two kids tear through the forest as the Alpha quickly
recovers and pursues
EXT FOREST -- MOMENTS LATER

John and Leah weave among a thicket of small trees but the
Alpha-- hot on their heels-- plows right through everything

The two kids reach the bottom of a steep BANK the country
ROAD at the top

Scrambling on all-fours they try to scale the incline but
the slippery leaves blanketing the slope offer no traction

Halfway up John and Leah both slip and slide back down the
incline right into the path of the charging Alpha seconds
away from trampling them

John clings to Leah covering her as the Alpha takes a flying
leap diving straight down at them

SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF NOWHERE A RED-HOT FLARE SAILS THROUGH
THE FOREST CATCHING THE ALPHA IN ITS EXPOSED CHEST

The Alpha writhes and howls tumbling off its trajectory
smashing hard into the bank missing John and Leah

The two look upward at the crest of the slope Taka lowers
his FLARE GUN Blake by his side

TAKA
Now that’s how you do it to it

BLAKE
Please stop saying that
(to JohnandLeah)
Hey love-birds Let’s go

Not wasting a moment John and Leah manage to clamor up the
incline Blake and Taka have John and Leah’s bikes waiting
all four begin pedalling as fast as they can down the country
road

TAKA
(to Leah)
Did you let him touch a boob

Leah reaches out socking Taka in the arm

Meanwhile the Alpha recovers from the flare burn charging
up the hill with a snarl

EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

The kids come to a steep long HILL-- a fortuitous break
Their bikes pick up speed as they catapult downhill

Then somewhere in the short distance a long WHISTLE sounds

TAKA
(pointing)
LOOK

A FREIGHT TRAIN-- easily two miles long-- speeding its way
across the basin tracks running across the road ahead

Suddenly a ROAR close behind them The kids glance backwards
as the Alpha crests the top of the hill

BLAKE
OH SHIT

The kids pedal as fast as they can IT’S A RACE TO THE
BOTTOM they need reach the base and cross the tracks before
the train or theyll be cut-off left to face the Alpha

A frenetic blur of legs pumping and pedalling Shaky wheels
under stress Faces grit and determined

JOHN
COME ON FASTER

About a hundred yards behind them and gaining fast the
relentless Alpha starts closing in

Without letting up Taka blindly reaches into his backpack
with one hand he pulls out a full-deck of POKEMON CARDS
casting them into the eddy behind him

The cards take to the eddy in a blinding swirl several
smacking the charging Alpha in the snout and face causing
momentary break in stride but it might not be enough

The train whistle sounds again the Alpha roaring as if in
response

The kids reach the bottom of the hill their momentum
carrying them toward the train-tracks but the train has
nearly reached the crossing its gonna be close

Another long deep whistle-- deafening at this range its
single powerful headlight makes night day

John dares to look back-- the Alpha is only a few yards
behind

BWAAAAAAAHHH The whistle blares again as Blake speeds across
the tracks first followed closely by Taka then Leah

-John looks behind him the Alpha so close he can feel
its huffing hot stale breath on his neck

John stands up on his pedals cranking as powerfully as he
can

BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHE

With literally only a couple feet to spare John speeds
across the train-tracks narrowly missing the ENGINE CAR as
it barrels across the junction

Back on the other side the Alpha pulls up at the last
possible moment barely avoids getting hit by hundreds of
thousands of tons of speeding steel

Confused it paces back and forth trying to find a way
across but there is no end in sight for the train yet

EXT TRAIN TRACKS -- MOMENTS LATER

Back on the other side of the speeding train John throws up
his arms in victory

JOHN
Whohoo That’s right bitch

The others cheer and quickly continue down the --

EXT ROAD -- CONTINUOUS
John pays special attention to Leah short of breath again

JOHN
You OK

Her breathing is labored but she does not hyperventilate

LEAH
(smiles )
Yeah thanks

BLAKE
Dude nice move with the cards back

TAKA
I know right Like Jack Burton

SCREEEEEECH A CAR comes from out of nowhere skidding to a
halt right into their path The others are able to brake in
time but

SLAM Taka barrels right into the front end of the car
catapulting him across the hood He crash-lands a good twenty-
feet out

The driver’s side window rolls down indignant eyes meet
bewildered gazes from the kids

LEAH
Justin

Justins face says he ain’t messin’ around

JUSTIN

LEAH
Why--
JUSTIN

it
LEAH
Oh The weed Well kinda

Justin’s icy death-glare is his answer

BLAKE (CONT’D)
(overly agreeable)

Come on guys lets go

The kids get in the backseat Chet sticks his head out his
window

CHET
(to Taka)
Hey Panda Express you dead

A short distance away Taka grumbles as he pulls himself off
the ground fortunately he landed on his back-pack

TAKA
I think I have a concussion
assholes

CHET

Good Get in
Taka staggers to the car gets into the back with the others

TAKA
(groaning)
Who needs a drink

Moments later the Camaro peels out tail-light disappearing
into the night

EXT FRACKING SITE -- NIGHT

The redandblue lights of Sheriff Bronson’s car are still
flashing as Deputy Wells pulls up

Wells gets out expecting to spot Bronson somewhere close-by
but scanning the area Bronson is no where in sight

WELLS WELLS (CONTD)
(into walkie) Bronson come back over
Bronson come back over

Wells hears his own voice as through a walkie he spots
Bronson’s radio lying on the ground His flashlight beam
soon finds BULLET-CASING littering the area

WELLS
(into walkie)
‘424Deloris you better get
State on the radio

DELORIS (VO)
Copy that ‘424’ everything OK
Dan

Wells’ flashlight shines on large smears of BLOOD trailing
off towards the sinkhole

WELLS
No No it’s not
INT JUSTIN’S CAMARO -- LATER

Bad rock music blares as Justin and Chet bob their heads to

the beat Crammed in the back John Blake
are a mixture of bored annoyed and tired

LEAH
(over the noise)
Can we please listen to something
else Or nothing

CHET
Sorry we don’t have any One
Direction for you tweens

JUSTIN
(to Chet)
How do you know the band ‘One
Direction’

CHET

John tries to whisper to Leah across Taka and Blake

JOHN
What are we doing

JUSTIN

You little shits are going to come

with us on the rest of our runs

tonight Then you’re all gonna find

a way to come up with the 50 you
owe me or none of you are going
home

BLAKE
You take Discover

JUSTIN

Keep it up smart-ass You’ll find

out how serious I am

JOHN
Would it sway you in any way that
weve been running from some kind

of huge rabid monsters all night

Justin just turns up the volume on the stereo again and the
kids resign to their situation at the moment

EXT LOUELLA DR -- LATER

Justin’s car turns onto ‘Louella Drive’ an idyllic affluent
suburban street They pull up in front of

EXT JENI BELL’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Blake and Taka instantly recognize the house

BLAKETAKA
OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD

Loud music pumps inside a party in full-swing

BLAKE
Are you going to Jeni Bell’s
place
JUSTIN
Yeah Having some party Big order

Justin gets out The kids watch him walk up to Jeni Bell’s
door Taka and Blake especially envious

BLAKE
We gotta get into that party

CHET
Keep dreamin’ shit-heads You
better start thinking about ways to
get us our fifty-bucks

A smug smile spreads across Taka’s face

TAKA
Chet we’re both business men so
what would you say if I said I
could double that fifty bucks in
under twenty minutes and all it
will take from you is an investment
of one-hundred dollars up front

EXT JENI BELL’S HOUSE -- LATER

Justin walks away from Jeni Bell’s front door cutting across
the lawn and continues down the street

-Simultaneously John Blake Taka and Leah are sneaking
around the far-side of the house towards the backyard

EXT SIDE YARD -- MOMENTS LATER

The kids funnel into a single file slipping between the side
of Jeni’s house and the neighbor’s FENCE

Taka brandishes a hundred dollar bill

TAKA
Sometimes it’s just ‘tooooo easy

JOHN

(dead-flat)
Uh heyjust to jump back in the
evening a bit Does any one care
about the fact we were relentlessly
pursued by the aforementioned
‘monsters’ for the majority of the
evening and oh-my-god monsters
are real

It is clear the group’s concerns have moved on to the party

TAKA
Old news

BLAKE
I’m in heavy denial

LEAH
Ok They clearly weren’t
‘monsters’ Probably some kind of
weird wild animal or something Who
knows who cares We got away

JOHN
And what about Sheriff Bronson

Beat Everyone stops stumped
BLAKE
Ummmm we find a phone in the
house and call in an anonymous tip
and hope he’s OK

They continue on

JOHN
Taka what are you gonna do with
that hundred bucks

TAKA
Lose my virginity tonight duh

LEAH

TAKA
Why Wanna make a c-note

BLAKE
John why do you look like you’re
going to your grandmother’s anal
bleaching

JOHN
We don’t belong at this kind of
thing

BLAKE
This is the dopest party of the
summer Didn’t you want to be cool

JOHN
I mean yeah but I don’t want to
fake it

The kids reach the backyard all stop and stare looks of awe
on their faces Taka throws his arm around John

BLAKE
we’re gonna be in high school
Johnny-boy Everyone fakes it

REVEAL-——

EXT BACKYARD -- CONTINUOUS
The party of the summer-- maybe even the decade

Throngs of co-ed teens (all 1718) engaged in every
Republican parents’ worst nightmare music blasts bikini-
clad girls frolic all manner of drinking games are well
underway-- this is the party we all wanted to go to in high
school times a hundred

Our esteemed group of social pariahs are confounded at the
spectacle-- and clearly sticking out four years younger than
anyone else

BLAKE
This Is Awesome

Taka sees a SENIOR BOY yank the strings on a SENIOR GIRL’S
bikini-- a quick flash of her breasts

TAKA
Oh thank you God

The group spots MRS BELL (late 40’s)-- affluent house-wife
who tries her best to emulate her daughters’ appearance and
style She holds court with a group of Abercrombie jocks

Martini in hand-- ‘Real Housewife’ indeed
BLAKE
Dude who’s that old chick She’s
hot
LEAH

That’s their mother

As the kids begin to enter they are blocked by two senior
MEAT HEADS

MEAT HEAD 1
‘The Hell Where do you midgets
think you’re going

BLAKE
Uh I do not believe ‘midgets’ is
the preferred nomenclature

MEAT HEAD 2
Youre real dumb kid you know
that

The Meat Heads prepare to bounce the gang when--
TAKA
(holds up the 100)
Gentlemen gentlemen I believe
this should make things right
Meat Head 1 snatches the bill satisfied

MEAT HEAD 1
Freshmen scum

MEAT HEAD 2
Come on let’s go find an excuse to
take off our shirts
The jocks move on as our gang enters the revelry

BLAKE
Nice work

TAKA
And thank you Chet

They then spot JENI BELL and a small group of her
friends that her older sister has allowed in

BLAKE
There’s Jeni

TAKA
We will see her boobs tonight By
this I swear

LEAH
Annnnnnd I’m out Later douches

Leah saunters off into the party

JOHN
Nice going

TAKA

BEGIN SERIES

The DJ drops a hot track and the party double-downs The kids
slowly separate and attempt to blend in

POOLSIDE

Taka and Blake try beer for the first time secretly hate it
but win ‘cred with some of the girls which they like

KITCHEN

John waits in line for the keg Two of Jeni’s FRIENDS approach

GIRL 1
Hey someone said you fought Kevin
Ralston today

By the looks on their faces the girls don’t know any of the
details John decides to capitalize on this

JOHN
Uhyeah We had some beef you
know ‘guy stuff’ No big deal

GIRL 2
But I heard you lost

JOHN

(sotto)
“Recreate yourself recreate
yourself”

(turns back to the girls)
Lost That’s cute More like he got
in a lucky punch I saw his junk in
the locker room once and I just
couldn’t bring myself to hit a guy
with a micro dick

The girls’ interest peek at this new bit of gossip

JOHN (CONTD)
He’s just sad really

LIVING ROOM

Blake makes a phone call to the police station he masks his
voice by doing his same impression of Alan Rickman

BLAKE

Hello This is ‘anonymous’ I
believe I saw Sheriff Bronson out
by the Omni-Tech site he may have
fallen into a rather large hole
So yeah

(unheard response)
Thank you why yes people do tell
me that all the time

BACKYARD

- A break-dancing battle starts ala ‘Step Up’ Taka jumps in
out of nowhere and brings the house down

- John navigates the party (Boogey Nights style) soaking in
being apart of the social elite He finds Leah BICYCLE-BEER
JOUSTING She challenges him he’s reluctant at first but
then goes for it

POOL
Taka sits on Blake’s shoulders playing chicken in the pool

with two cute senior girls but mid-fight to Blake’s horror
realizes that Taka has a boner but can’t get Taka off

EXT BALCONY -- LATER

Seeking a quiet break from the party John and Leah sit on
the second story balcony of Jeni’s house overlooking the
crowd legs dangle between the wood bars Leah is slightly
buzzed John looks especially pensive

LEAH
Hey if you didn’t notice this is
a party Why do you look like peed
your pants

JOHN
This is the closest we’ll ever get
you know

LEAH

Huh To what

JOHN
(re the party)
To this To them

LEAH
Do you really care Is ‘this’ what
you want

JOHN
I want to not be ‘nobody’ The kid
who always gets his ass kicked
Things are changing You don’t get
it yet in high school everything
everything is more important
Everything is for real Everything
matters The next four years will
define who I am for the rest of my
life And that’s what I’m afraid
of

Leah bursts out laughing

LEAH
Oh my god you’re an idiot Did you
just hear yourself No wonder Kevin
wants to beat you up all the time
I feel like punching you now

JOHN
Thanks

LEAH
You’re so fucking worried about
what these people think of you
people you don’t even like
(MORE)
LEAH (CONTD)
You define yourself dumbass Why
do you think you need to be
something else for them

JOHN
Because I don’t want to be ‘me’
anymore

LEAH
Then I was right You are an idiot
You don’t need to change You just
need confidence

JOHN
(dismissive)
Yeah alright

LEAH
Whatever
(pause)
You haven’t asked me about what
almost happened back in the woods

JOHN
When we almost got eaten by the
horrible horrible creature of the
night

LEAH
No The other thing

It takes John a moment

JOHN
Like when almost

John suddenly gets embarrassed

LEAH
Almost what Come on man this is
what I mean confidence

John musters up the courage to scoot a bit closer

JOHN

Leah blinks softly

LEAH
I know Me too

There doesn’t need to be anymore words the two teenagers’
faces drift closer hanging precariously in that moment of
anticipation

Leah coyly

bites her lip a little scared John holds

breath as he finally goes in for the kill their lips
begin to brush when--

VOICE(0S)

more bagel cards

Leah elbows Taka in the ribs

BLAKE
Dude Not cool

KEVIN
Heard you were talking shit about

‘lucky’ when I beat your ass this

John catches the eyes of the two girls he’d been bragging to
earlier-- they avert their gaze quickly

KEVIN (CONTD)
So is that what you think You
think I was ‘lucky’

JOHN
Um Ier

KEVIN
Ok so maybe I got lucky

Kevin takes off his hoodie preparing to brawl

KEVIN (CONTD)
So let’s see if my luck runs out
this time

Blake steps out from the crowd

BLAKE
Come on dude don’t be a dick

Taka following suit

TAKA

Ok poor phrasing sorry

Kevin and his friends laugh

LINDSEY

Upon seeing the menacing Justin Taka and Blake try to sneak

Justin moves toward John grabbing him by the neck

KEVIN
Yo who the fuck are--

Justin whips a glare at Kevin

Justin feels the contempt in her eyes it effects him but
only we sense it

JUSTIN

Brother and sister stare each other down John literally
caught in the middle Then

WELLS (0S)

WELLS

(to Mrs Bell)

JUSTIN
Whatever you say ‘deputy’

WELLS

JUSTIN
(smarmy )
No sir Just picked ‘em up off
Atwood road ‘bout an hour ago

WELLS
Then hit the road

Justin defiantly backs off but shoots a look to the kids
that says ‘Next time’ Justin and Chet exit

WELLS (CONT’D)
Ok you four

John Blake Taka and Leah ‘gulp’ collectively

WELLS (CONT’D)
An anonymous phone call came from
this house claiming information on
Sheriff Bronson Deloris said he
sounded a lot like ‘the bad guy
from Die Hard’

Wells turns his eyes on Blake Everyone groans

BLAKE
Well how do you know it wasn’t
really Alan Rickman

WELLS
I was at the Omni-Tech site There
was blood everywhere Now I’m very
serious you need to tell me
exactly what happened

INT LIVING ROOM -- SIMULTANEOUS

About a dozen of Lindsey and Jeni’s friends still linger
including Kevin

LINDSEY
This is bullshit Those losers
ruined my party

KEVIN
Don’t worry I’ll make sure they
get what’s coming to them

THUMP Suddenly SOMETHING BIG AND HEAVY slams into Jeni’s
front door startling everyone

JENT
What the Hell is that

THUMP The entire door-frame almost separates from the wall

KEVIN
Uh

LINDSEY
Seriously is someone fucking with
me

Kevin warily approaches the door

THUMP Kevin stumbles back the force almost knocking him
over Freaked-out everyone waits for another impact

EXT BACKYARD -- SIMULTANEOUS

WELLS
Someone want to start talking
Beginning with what happened at
Cameron’s house

BLAKE
I really don’t think youd believe
us if we--
Off Wells’s stern look

BLAKE (CONTD)
Pfft alright Ok so there’s this--

TAKA
(points nonchalant)
Oh dude it’s right there see

Wells looks over his shoulder in the direction Taka is
pointing

By the driveway crouching low menacing as ever THE ALPHA

Wells just stares unable to process what he’s seeing

BLAKE
Uh you maybe wanna use your gun
dumbass

WELLS

Everyone slowly get behind me

LEAH
Were already behind you

WELLS
Ok then start walking to the
house SLOW

Taka begins to take him literally walking at a comedic snail
pace The creature growls

WELLS (CONT’D)
Ok less slow

As the kids dash toward the house the Alpha cranes its snout
in their direction a deep GROWL in its throat

Wells draws his gun fires into the air

WELLS (CONTD)
HEY

The Alpha swivels its head back to Wells

WELLS (CONT’D)
Oh crap

With a snarl the Alpha CHARGES Wells takes aim firing
several times but the Alpha is undeterred
The Alpha LEAPS claws extended bearing down on Wells

At the last second Wells ROLLS out of the way-- the Alpha
misses CRASHING INTO THE POOL

WELLS (CONTD)
RUN

Wells and the kids scramble toward Jeni’s patio door just as
Jeni slides it open with a bitchy expression

JENT
What is going--

SPLOOOOOOOSH AN ENORMOUS SHOWER OF WATER EXPLODES UP FROM
THE POOL THE ALPHA CATAPULTING OUT WITH A BELLOWING ROAR

Jeni SCREAMS as she’s pulled inside along with the others We
stay with our kids as they tear through Jeni’s lavish house

Sounds and backwards glimpses of the Alpha crashing through
the patio glass in hot-pursuit as lingering party-goers
scream and scatter

Jeni’s mom takes little notice of the bedlam more interested
in finishing her martini

Meanwhile John leads the charge as they blow by a baffled
Kevin Confused Kevin watches our kids as they fly out the
front door he looks back to see the stampeding Alpha

Kevin screams like a 10 year old girl as the Alpha BUCKS ITS
HEAD sending Kevin crashing into the far wall

The Alpha continues bursting through the entire front wall
of Jeni’s house and out into the front yard
EXT JENI BELL’S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Only a few yards ahead of it our kids and Wells run for his
squad car Taka reaches for the back door-- locked

Wells fumbles for his keys

BLAKE
Shit Dan hurry

Terrified Wells accidentally drops his keys

BLAKE (CONTD)
SERIOUSLY

-but it’s too late the Alpha is upon them Everyone
flattens against the squad car bracing for the end

The Alpha roars preparing to lunge when suddenly--
A cacophony of noise and lights IT’S THE OMNI-TECH CALVARY

Two black trucks roar up onto the lawn a dozen Omni-Tech
SECURITY PERSONAL rush out armed with strange weapons

The guards descend on the Alpha confused by the lights and
sounds the Alpha bucks and roars (think a hunting party of
African tribesmen surrounding a lion)

Wells and the kids watch in awe as the guards expertly use
tranquilizers nets and cables to bring the Alpha down
It’s all executed impressively fast

EXT JENI BELL’S HOUSE -- LATER

The soldiers begin loading the now sedated Alpha into a large
covered truck bed

The operations commander LANG(50’s) strides up addressing
Wells The kids listen in

LANG
You the Sheriff

BLAKE
No he’s just the deput--

WELLS
And who are you

LANG
I’m in charge of site-security for
Omni-Tech

WELLS
(leery)
Packing some heavy duty inventory
for security

LANG
Obviously we’re dealing with an
extremely dangerous animal We’ve--

WELLS
What the hell is it
LANG
From the information I’ve been
given it is an endangered
subterranean sub-species Very
rare

WELLS
Information from who

The commander clocks Wells’s tone

LANG
Neither of us are scientists
deputy so it’s not your
concern However what is is
getting these kids back to their
homes and restoring order to your
neighborhood

WELLS
I thought Omni-Tech was just an
energy company What’s with the
private army

LANG
The company takes its security very
seriously deputy

Lang’s tone alludes to something much bigger but we may
never know any more

WELLS
I’ve got more questions not to
mention my superior Sheriff
Bronson is missing and may be--

LANG
There will be a team of Omni-Tech
representatives out here first
thing in the morning They will
work closely with you and your town
to answer your questions and
rectify any damages

WELLS
But the Sheriff might be--

LANG
Until then all land and property
owned and operated by Omni-Tech is
strictly off-limits to local and
state-authorities baring a primary
cooperative investigation between
Omni-Tech and DOD’s office

WELLS
DOD The Department of Defense
What do they--

LANG
You have your instructions deputy
Now if you’ll excuse me

With a dismissive glance Lang takes his leave as the rest of
his garrison wraps-up

BLAKE
That guy was a dick

LEAH
Huge dick

TAKA
Say that again only slower

JOHN
Something’s not right

Wells and John share a silent look of mutual understanding

BLAKE
Yeah genius A twelve foot raging
‘endangered subterranean species’
chased us all night and just about
made us its morning crap

Moments later the two Omni-Tech trucks drive off one truck
bed now containing the Alpha

WELLS
Well I suppose ‘that’s that’
until morning
(turns to Jeni’s house)
I’m going to get the fire
department out here to help with
the house

Jeni Bell stands bitching hysterically in the gaping hollow
of what used to be the front of her house The rest of our
kids can’t help but grin

WELLS (CONT’D)
You all better get on home

BLAKE
We can’t our bikes are all out on
Atwood road

WELLS
(re car)
Alright hop in the back I’1l
drive you to get them

TAKA
Sweet Shotgun

WELLS
Oh Hell no

INT SQUAD CAR -- LATER

In the front Wells battles with Taka’s curious hand reaching
through the narrow partition trying touch all the scanner
and computer equipment

John sits shotgun staring out the window despondent

LEAH
(from the back)
What’s the matter Sad to be alive
or something

JOHN
The whole school watched Kevin
humiliate meagain

LEAH
After all that’s happened tonight

until my loser brother broke it up

JOHN
I’m just some chump some small-
sack everyone can just pick on

LEAH
You’re not a chump

TAKA
She doesn’t speak for all of us

LEAH
God shut up Or you won’t need a
cookie to know your fortune

TAKA
Yes Finally originality

WELLS
(re off-screen)
Oh my god
The kids turn looking out the windows

ALL
Oh shit

EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

Wells halts the car everyone staring out at

UTTER DECIMATION

Both Omni-Tech trucks have been over-turned the bodies of
the Omni-Tech security personal strewn across the entire

area It’s a massacre Wells gets out of the car

WELLS
Stay inside

BLAKE
Yeah ‘ya think

Wells inspects the slaughter It’s gruesome-- several graphic
eviscerations and decapitations

Wells shines his flashlight in the back of the truck where
the Alpha was placed Empty

INT SQUAD CAR -- MOMENTS LATER
The kids peer out from all sides

TAKA
Oh man I see dead people

JOHN
I think I see someone Looks like
he’s alive

John eagerly opens the front passenger door hopping out
LEAH BLAKE

Are you insane Dude what the fuck are you
doing

EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

A bloody HAND raises into the air signaling life John runs
up to it it’s Lang badly wounded his other hand is keeping
his guts from falling out

JOHN
Hey are you OK--

John sees the evisceration

JOHN (CONTD)
Oh Uhshit man

LANG
Don’t be afraid

JOHN
I gotta say this is freaking me
out a little

LANG
The light it’s the light

JOHN
Huh What’s ‘the light’

Lang’s eyes glaze over and John sees death for the first
time Lang’s final cryptic words resonating

WELLS (0S)
Jesus JOHN GET BACK IN THE CAR

A short distance away Wells shouts waving frantically

John stands up his gaze shifting to the squad car his
friends wave at him He waves back

CLOSER and John sees their faces shouting in terror as they
pointmotion

A sick realization settles in as John slowly turns around to
see THE ALPHA MELTING OUT OF THE NIGHT plodding toward him

WITH WELLS

He sees the Alpha descending on John but he’s too far away
He draws his gun takes aim -- but it clicks empty

WELLS (CONT’D)
No

INT SQUAD CAR -- SIMULTANEOUS

Stuck in the backseat Taka Blake and Leah pound on the
windows watching in horror They try to get out but the
back-seat doors of the squad car are locked from the outside

BLAKE
Run you stupid asshole RUN

LEAH
Oh shit It’s gonna get him

TAKA
I can’t watch
EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

John is frozen to the spot The Alpha reaches John towering
above him a deep grunt uttering from its throat

In the distance Wells screams trying to get the Alpha’s
attention as he dashes up the road

John looks back at the squad car locks eyes with Leah

SLOW MO John never takes his eyes off Leah as behind him
the Alpha roars opening his jaws wide moving in

INT SQUAD CAR -- SIMULTANEOUS

SLO MO(cont’) Through the windshield Leah and the others
watch the Alpha chomp down on John Leah mouth opens to
scream

We suddenly are jolted into REAL-TIME Leah screams becomes
piercing as Blake and Taka turn away
EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- SIMULTANEOUS

We see the scene again from Wells’s POV the Alpha takes John
into its mouth

-but it does NOT snap down instead it picks up John--like
a lioness picking up her cub-- turns and runs off into the
night carrying John in its muzzle

Wells slows watching helplessly as John is carried off

INT SQUAD CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

Wells gets into the squad car

TAKA BLAKE
OHMYGOD IT ATE HIM IT HOLY SHIT MAN HOLY SHIT
FUCKING ATE HIM HOLY SHIT
WELLS

It didn’t eat him
Taka and Blake both stop wailing on a dime

TAKA
Wait whaaa

WELLS
It didn’t eat him-- it carried him
off in its mouth

LEAH
Carried him off To where

WELLS
I think I can guess

BLAKE
That huge hole

TAKA
Ah shit man we gotta go after him
That’s our boy

WELLS
‘We’re’ not going anywhere You’re
just kids You’re gonna wait here
and I’1l have Deloris come get you

TAKA BLAKE
What Bullshit man No way in hell

WELLS (CONTD)
This isn’t up for discussion it’s
an order

LEAH
And here’s our order we’re going
to get our friend back ‘You’ are
allowed to come along if you want
This isn’t up for discussion

Wells looks at the three sets of determined eyes glaring back
at him He knows he’s already lost this fight

WELLS
You stay close You do everything I
say

BLAKE

Hell yeah Now let’s hit up your
station and load us up on
firepower

WELLS
First off I’m definitely not
giving any of you guns Christ
Secondly Sheriff Bronson is the
only one who has the key to the
armory

TAKA
Well that was stupid

WELLS
It’ll take the state police at
least forty-five minutes to get out
here assuming they’11l even believe
me

BLAKE
John doesn’t have that kind of
time What are we going to do

ANGLE ON Leah

LEAH
I know exactly what we’re gonna
do

EXT KEVIN RALTON’S HOUSE -- LATER

A bruised and banged-up Kevin Ralston opens the front door of
his house to find Blake Taka and Leah standing on his front
step Deputy Wells behind them

KEVIN
What the fuck do you want

LEAH
(stone-cold)
John is in trouble Big trouble
Get your dad to open his sports
store We need equipment

KEVIN
Screw you And my dad’s not even
here he’s out of town

LEAH
Then you’re going to come open it
up for us

KEVIN
Ha What makes you think--

LEAH
Because you don’t want to spend the
rest of your life being a total
dick Kevin

KEVIN
Huh

LEAH
You have a choice you can drop the
shitty attitude and choose to help
a kid who has never done anything
to you or you can see how far
being a life-long asshole gets you
Believe me I know how those guys
turn out

Kevin holds his ground seemingly defiant

EXT RALSTON SPORTING GOODS MAIN STREET -- LATER

Kevin slides back the collapsible metal gate covering his
father’s store front unlocks the door Wells Blake Taka
and Leah file in

KEVIN
Figures that little dork would’ve
gotten himself into something like
this

Blake’s ears prick up

BLAKE
Come again Because I watched that
‘little dork’ stand right up to
that thing Just like he stood up
to you both times today

KEVIN
Pfft He didn’t ‘stand-up’ he just
‘stood there’

BLAKE
He’s thirteen Kevin His dad is
six-foot-five two-hundred-twenty
pounds

(MORE)

BLAKE (CONTD)

What do you think John is going to
look like by the time he’s a
senior And who do you think he’11l
remember giving him shit when he
was a freshmen And PS your
little comment at the party His
mom died last year dickhead

Beat

KEVIN
Let me show you where the baseball
bats are

Kevin eagerly jumps to help

TAKA
(aside)
Dude John’s dad is barely taller
than I am

BLAKE
Yeah I know

MONTAGE

Classic ‘gear-up’ scene make-shift weaponry made from a
medley of sports equipment It ain’t no joke they are able
to make very durable effective weapons and protection

EXT RALSTON SPORTING GOODS MAIN STREET -- LATER

Armed to the teeth and ready for battle the troops file out
of the store toward Wells’ squad car

KEVIN
Hey wait up

Kevin jogs up wearing a hockey mask and an umpire’s chest-
pad

KEVIN (CONTD)
I’m coming too

LEAH
I thought you didn’t care

KEVIN
(earnest)
I figured this is partially my
fault
(MORE)
KEVIN (CONTD)
If I had beat him up enough
earlier he’d probably be in the
hospital now and wouldn’t have
gotten ‘nabbed by that thing

Everyone raises an eyebrow Kevin really believes his logic

TAKA
Suuuuure

Everyone piles into Wells’s car Leah is about to step in
when she’s suddenly caught in a pair of headlights She turns

as Justin’s Camaro pulls up

LEAH
Oh God

Leah walks over as Justin rolls down his window

JUSTIN
(re her get-up)
Ha What are you in some kinda
lesbian roller-derby

LEAH
What do you want

JUSTIN
Driving by and saw you all I don’t
give a shit that you’re still
riding along with Deputy Retard
just letting you know you’re not
off the hook and when you finally
come home there’s gonna be--

LEAH
I may not come home Justin In
fact I probably won’t because
I’1l most likely be dead in about
an hour One of my friends is in
trouble and I’m going to go help
him and probably die trying But
that’s what I do for my family

JUSTIN
Youserious

Leah storms away

LEAH
Yeah I am And I’m sure your pal
Chet there would do the same for
you

INT JUSTINS CAMERO -- CONTINUOUS
Justin looks over to see Chet smoking out of an APPLE BONG

CHET
(exhaling)
It’s healthier cause it filters
through an apple

Justin looks back watching his sister get into the squad
car a conflicted look in his eye

INT SQUAD CAR -- MOMENTS LATER
Wells pulls out Taka had overheard Leah’s conversation

TAKA
Hey no one mentioned anything
about dying

BLAKE
Look at it this way at least we
wont have to deal with high
school

INT SMALL CAVERN -- LATER

John’s eyes blink open finding himself in darkness He pulls
a LIGHTER out of his pocket The small flame barely
illuminates an UNDERGROUND CAVE

He begins to cautiously explore SQUISH -- steps in something
slimy Shines the light on the ground to see he’s stepped in
a small pile of POOP

JOHN
Shit

John voice is unexpectedly loud in the cave Suddenly as if
in response a TINY GROWL then another tiny growl coming
from the opposite side He puts two and two together

JOHN (CONTD)
Shit
EXT FRACKING SITE -- LATER

Wells Blake Taka Leah and Kevin stand peering down into
the black sink-hole a mixture of trepidation and dread

BLAKE
He’s down there huh

WELLS
Bronson’s blood trail leads down
there-- John’s gotta be down there
too

TAKA
Just a quick poll we’re all sure
we like John enough that we’re
about to--

Leah turns and swiftly PUNCHES Taka in the nuts

TAKA (CONTD)
(squelching in pain)
She touched it

WELLS
Blake get the rope Everyone make
sure you’ve got your flashlights
handy
(dramatic beat)
It’s going to get a whole lot
darker before the light

BLAKE
I feel you could’ve come up with
something better I know you have
it in you

WELLS
Shut up Blake

INT SMALL CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

Using the lighter John searches for the source of the two
smaller growls Sounds of movement around him-- he knows
something(s) are circling him

JOHN
Awesome Exactly how I pictured
today was gonna play out

John’s foot kicks a large rock he immediately grabs it
John catches glimpses of two fast moving FORMS scampering

across the walls The forms are maybe the size of baby
gorillas covered in translucent hair

JOHN (CONTD)
Great Siblings

He raises the rock his only means of defense

Suddenly John’s heel hits something on the ground He spins
around to see SHERIFF BRONSON’S BODYor what’s left of it
his major organs were tonight’s appetizers

John reels back but then notices Bronson’s UTILITY BELT
still in tact He quickly grabs a flashlight mace and
baton He switches on the flashlight its powerful beam
searching the darkness for

THE TWO CREATURES

We see them in full-light now creepy as hell and dangerous
looking each crouching behind rocks ready to pounce John
raises the baton in his other hand

JOHN (CONTD)
Ok you can do this

With a shrill roar the first creature LEAPS toward John
jaws snapping

INT UNDERGROUND CAVERN -- ELSEWHERE

On the cavern FLOOR Wells helps Taka down the final few feet
of the rope The rest have already descended and await the
next move Wells points his beam down a

LARGE TUNNEL

WELLS
This way

Wells leads the rest follow treading cautiously

TAKA
(to Blake)
Well this is both horrifying and
awesome

BLAKE
Totally This time yesterday did
you think you’d be doing something
like this

TAKA
This time yesterday I was humping
my pillow The trick is you fold it
over like a taco

BLAKE
Dude is there anything you havent
boned

TAKA

What you mean like a girl
MOMENTS LATER The tunnel splits-- now what

WELLS
Shit which way

LEAH
We split up

WELLS
That is NOT happening

LEAH

It’s not not happening You take
Taka Kevin and Blake you’re with
me

Leah heads down one of the tunnels Blake and Kevin shrug
then follow

WELLS
Leah Get back here now

LEAH
You sound like my father I didn’t
listen to him either

Reluctantly Wells lets her and the others go

INT SMALLER CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

SCREEEEEECH John swats at the two small creatures as they
trade off attacks He dodges and weaves his flashlight
strobes erratically giving us only terrifying glimpses of
the assailing creatures

One lands on his back biting and clawing at his neck and
shoulder John yells in pain
INT TUNNEL 1 -- SIMULTANEOUS

John’s scream echoes down the tunnel Leah halts the others
in their tracks-- sounds close

LEAH
Hurry

Leah Blake and Kevin dash further into the tunnel

INT SMALLER CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER
John staggers mid-battle between the two smaller creatures

THWACK He finally lands a solid hit with the baton smashing
one of the creatures to the ground He immediately spins and
BACKHANDS the second one in mid-air as it leaps for him
sending it crashing into the far wall

The second creatures whimpers and scampers off down a small
hole in the wall

John turns his attention on the remaining stunned creature
laying on the ground Raises his baton for the death-blow

-but then he begins to take pity on the creature as it lays
whimpering on the ground John relaxes his guard

Wrong move The creature flips up sinking its teeth into
Johns ankle

JOHN
You little shit

John brings down the baton HARD on the creature-- again and
again and again until a bloody pulp is all that remains He
looks at his ankle-- fortunately his high-tops sneaker took
the brunt of the damage

JOHN (CONTD)
Damnit These were new you assho--

ROOOOOQOOQOOOOOOOOAR 11

John knows that roar by now the Alpha and he’s close His
flashlight finds the only way out a large gape in the CAVERN
CEILING-- it’s high but within jumping reach

John tries jumping it’s pathetic his fingers come up way
short

JOHN (CONTD)
Why didn’t I go out for more
sports

ROOOOOOOOOAR

Even closer now John jumps again fingers firmly catching
and finally manages to hoist himself out

On his feet John can hear the loud thumps of the approaching
Alpha-- he takes off down one of several tunnel-conduits
INT TUNNEL 1 -- MOMENTS LATER

John runs for his life he shines the flashlight backwards
looking for signs of the Alpha when suddenly he SLAMS into

something

The flashlight drops to the ground A high-pitch scream is
heard-- sounds like it’s the other small creature

In a flurry John grabs the MACE and starts spraying wildly

LEAH BLAKE
AHHHH WHAT THE FUCK IT BURNS
More shrill screaming and we realize it had been Kevin

In the tangle of flailing bodies John accidentally sprays
himself Now all four kids are writhing around the tunnel
blinded

JOHN
Leah
LEAH
Yeah retard You sprayed all of
us
JOHN
Who’s screaming
BLAKE
That’s Kevin
JOHN
Gah--
Instinctively John starts to spray MOREexcept instead
of Kevin he nails Blake
BLAKE
(screaming)
It’s me you asshole STOP SPRAYING
Us
JOHN

Oh sorry What’s Kevin doing here

KEVIN
Listen I didn’t have to come

LEAH
Guys later OK

Leah produces a water bottle quickly rinses everyone’s eyes

JOHN
Sorry I thought you were one of
those things

LEAH
There’s more

JOHN
Yeah I think they’re its babies
Mean little shits We killed the
first one earlier which sent the
mother after us then the father I
just pulverized another one and
there’s one more left Plus dad

BLAKE
Oh wonderful

LEAH
We gotta get out of here is
everyone OK

Leah shines her flashlight in the face of John and Blake
their eyesarea around their eyes is red but otherwise fine

JOHNBLAKE
Yeah

She then shines the light on Kevin

KEVIN
I’m fine

But Kevin doesn’t look it his face is red and really puffy
KEVIN (CONTD)
(off their looks)
What What’s wrong

John Blake and Leah stifle their giggles still very little
sympathy for the bully

BLAKE
Nothingyou look great

Suddenly a low guttural GROWL echoes in the tunnel

The kids stop laughing slowly turning their flashlights down
the dark tunnel

Two EYES catch the beam popping out of the dark the Alpha

JOHN
RUN

The group immediately sprints in the opposite direction

INT TUNNEL 2 -- SIMULTANEOUS

Wells and Taka quietly tread along when a NOISE stops Taka
a high-pitch ‘clicking’ like something breathing

TAKA
Did you fart

WELLS
God you’re so weird

TAKA
I’m serious Did you hear that

WELLS
No I--

The clickingbreathing sounds again Wells and Taka’s
flashlights sweep the area for the source

Taka then realizes they’re looking in the wrong place his
head craning upward to see a small HOLE in the ceiling

The (second) small creature drops out of the hole RIGHT ONTO
TAKA like the Alien ‘Face-Hugger’ Taka reels back

TAKA
HOLY SHIT HOLY SHIT

Wells jumps into the action

WELLS
Hold still

Taka bucks and struggles with the creature while Wells tries
to tear it away only causing the creature to dig its tiny
claws further into Taka’s scalp

TAKA
You’re making it worse

WELLS
I said hold still

TAKA
AHHHHH It’s little dick is in my
mouth

Taka purposefully runs full-speed head-first into the cavern
wall smashing the creature The creature yelps as Taka rams
it again and again

Suddenly the creature lets go and Taka’s face smashes into
the cavern wall instead

TAKA (CONTD)
(groaning)
Saw that coming

The creature leaps at Wells but Wells swats it with a TENNIS
RACQUET sending it flying through the air right back at
Taka hitting him in the square in the stomach

TAKA (CONTD)

GAH
WELLS
Sorry
INT TUNNEL 1 -- SIMULTANEOUS

Leah Blake Kevin dash back down the tunnel with John
bringing up the rear-- the Alpha only a few yards behind

Another FORK in the tunnel ahead-- Leah and the others
continue down the same tunnel John makes the split-second
decision to lead the Alpha down the other route

JOHN
KEEP RUNNING

John veers down the other tunnel the Alpha takes the bait
LEAH
JOHN NO
INT TUNNEL 3 -- MOMENTS LATER

John hauls ass with only endless darkness ahead the Alpha
barreling down after him

JOHN
Damnit Never listen to my
instincts

INT TUNNEL 2 -- MOMENTS LATER

Wells continues to swat at the smaller creature but it is
too quick It leaps onto his face now

WELLS
Ahh Get it off

Taka points and laughs

TAKA
How does it feel now

WELLS
Im serious

Wells struggles to pry the creature of his face Taka jumps
in snatching Wells’ TASER off his belt

TAKA
(aiming)
Hold still

WELLS
(blind)
What are you doing

Taka fires the taser darts into the creature’s back-- a
direct hit The creature screams seizuring it drops off
Wells’ face fried

WELLS (CONT’D)
Holy shit Nice shot kid

TAKA
And thats how you do it to --

Right then John bolts PAST them via a connecting
perpendicular tunnel they had not seen

TAKA (CONTD)
Hey was that--

WHOOOOOSH The Alpha blows by pursuing John CRUSHING Wells’
foot as it passes Wells crumbles cries out clutching his
shattered foot

Taka leans forward meekly peering down the tunnel

TAKA (CONTD)
dohnny

SMACK The pursuing Leah Blake and Kevin collide with Taka
and the whole group tumbles to the tunnel floor onto Wells

WELLS
(from under)
Ok what the fu--

TAKA
Am I dead

LEAH
I’m not that lucky

TAKA
Oh hey guys

BLAKE
Someone’s elbow is in my crotch

KEVIN
That’s not an elbow

INT LARGE CAVERN -- MOMENTS LATER

As John runs the tunnel opens up into an ENORMOUS CAVERN
Water drips from huge stalactites dozens of smallandlarge
POOLS collect on the cavern floor

Kevins flashlight sweeps across the cavern walls searching
for a way out the flashlight begins to flicker

JOHN
Oh shit no come on

John shakes the flashlight in vain as the bulb slowly
fadesthen darkness

Seconds later a low-growl fills the cavern
John whips out his lighter its tiny flame barely illuminates
three feet in front of himand the dripping maw of the

Alpha

The Alpha huffs almost blowing the flame out John slowly
starts backing away the Alpha moving forward in turn

JOHN (CONT’D)
For what it’s worth I’m sorry But
your family were total dicks

The Alpha snarls again preparing to end this

The lighter’s reflection off a nearby POOL OF WATER catches
the corner of John’s eye

INSERT Lang dying as John watches

LANG
The lightit’s the light

BACK TO SCENE a realization in John’s eyes

JOHN
the light

On that John drops the lighter into the pool of water

Instantly FLAMES LEAP UP The Alpha reels back painfully
blinded from the fire

John scrambles to evade the Alpha as the fire continues to
spread from pool to pool

The Alpha recovers and begins precariously leaping and
weaving through pockets of flames after John using its nose

MOMENTS LATER

Leah Taka and Kevin enter the cavern Blake helps a
hobbling Wells All stare at the firey blaze in the cavern

TAKA
Whoa Sick

WELLS
What the Hell is this

LEAH
It’s the fracking The gelling
chemicals they use to drill contain
all kinds of bad stuff like methane
and formaldehyde It’s mixed with
the water

BLAKE
Frackin’ sweet

KEVIN
(pointing)
Look

The group zeros-in on John carefully navigating across the
cavern but the Alpha is gaining on him

LEAH
We gotta help him

Taka dramatically slings his Super-Soaker around his torso

TAKA
Fill me up

MOMENTS LATER

John reaches the far side of the cavern dashing across a
large pool of water that catches fire only seconds after

A huge WALL OF FIRE bursts up John is a bit relieved as
this will surely cut-off the Alpha’s pursuit

Wrong John turns to see the Alpha bounding over the wall of
fire into safe-territory with him John scrambles backwards
bumping up against the cavern wall-- the snarling Alpha
finally has him dead-to-rights

TAKA (0S) (CONTD)
HEY FUZZ-NUTS

The Alpha swivels its head Taka on the other side of the
flaming wall

TAKA (CONTD)
Ha-ha You looked

Taka pulls the trigger on his Super-Soaker sending a
powerful stream of the toxic cavern water shooting out as it
passes through the wall of fire it catches sending a firey
spray onto the Alphas hide

The Alpha bucks and roars rolling on the ground

LEAH
(pointing)
John-- get up there

John looks to see a RIDGE above him protruding over the
cavern floor about 15 feet-- if it he can reach it it’ll be
safe haven for sure

With the Alpha distracted John scrambles up the cavern wall
CAVERN FLOOR
LEAH (CONTD)
JOHN Stay there we’ll figure

something out

BLAKE
We will

TAKA
I had the water-gun idea Someone
else’s turn

LEAH
We gotta kill that thing

BLAKE
Yeah I don’t think it likes to die
very much

RIDGE -- CROSS CUT

Having reached the ridge John seems safe for the moment
watching the Alpha toss and roll on the cavern floor below
him He allows himself a moment of relief

Suddenly the Alpha recovers LEAPING onto the cavern wall
and to everyones horror easily scales up until it too
reaches the ridge

The beast steps out as John backs away nearing the cusp or
the ridge a pool of PURE FIRE below

LEAH
JOHN

The group is terrified but is helpless to aid their friend
The Alpha truly has John cornered now It stalks toward him
as the group can only watch in horror

WELLS
Guys shut your eyes Don’t
watch
LEAH
No
Then suddenly--
KEVIN
Well this one’s not gonna be on
me
ALL
WhatHuh

Kevin grabs Taka’s hockey gauntlets swipes Blake’s HOCKEY
STICK-- causing Wells’s full weight to fall on Blake

BLAKE
Oaf Hey

Kevin lowers his hockey mask over his face this combined
with his umpire’s chest-padding and football shoulder pads
makes for some decent protection from the fire

KEVIN
(turning to Leah)
I’m not gonna be an asshole

With that Kevin turns and DASHES INTO THE FLAMES
RIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER

John’s heels touch the edge of the overhang-- the Alpha
almost upon him-- ROARS shaking the entire cavern

Something stirs in John quickly building staring down the
last few moments of his life the boy is not facing the
Alpha rather he faces himself

The Alpha roars again-- AND JOHN LETS OUT A BELLOWING PRIMAL

SCREAM-- so loud so powerful even the Alpha is flummoxed

JOHN
I’M NOT BACKING DOWN YOU HEAR ME
I’M NOT BACKING DOWN YOU WANT ME
COME HERE COME AND GET ME YOU
PUSSY

The Alpha grunts as if out of respect Then ducks its head
preparing to pounce Suddenly a shout from below

KEVIN (0S)
JOHN

John looks down to see Kevin standing below As if throwing a
shot-put Kevin spins to gain momentum then HEAVES the
hockey stick upwards

Jdohn reaches out almost tipping over the edge but
successfully snatches the hockey stick out of the air

The Alpha bears down on John jaws widening to take him in

John sweeps around and JAMS THE HOCKEY STICK INTO THE ALPHA’S
MOUTH prying it open

With the hockey stick stuck the Alpha reels its head wildly
careless of its precarious footing on the cusp of the ridge

LEAH
Hit him John HIT HIM

Leah’s words echo in John’s ears glaring at the wild beast
John furrows his brow gritting his teeth

JOHN
I am done running from you

John unleashes a guttural cry charging the Alpha dropping
his shoulder and ramming into its side sending the Alpha
toppling OFF the ridge and into the large pool of fire
below

CAVERN FLOOR

The Alpha splashes down engulfed in flame-- its painful
bellows fill the cavern

Leah Taka Blake and Wells cheer

LEAH
John get down from there Hurry

John wastes no time in scrambling back down the cavern wall
Kevin meets him at the bottom

KEVIN
Come on stay behind me And hey
man sorry about what I said about
your mom

JOHN
(hesitant but then)
Thanks It’s cool

Kevin leads John through the wall of fire (his bodypadding
taking the brunt of it) Moments later the group is
reunited

On the other side of the ridge the Alpha flails in its death
throws but no one wants to stay around to watch

Leah tackles John in the hug of his life

LEAH
Holy shit John that was
incredible You did it You beat
that thing

TAKA
That was AWESOME

BLAKE
‘Awesome’ That was fucking epic

WELLS
Good work John

KEVIN
(to deaf ears)
Hey what about me

JOHN
Come on we gotta get out of here
This fire is going to spread fast

Everyone hurries out of the cavern

INT PIT GROUND FLOOR -- MOMENTS LATER

The group stares dauntingly up at the over 50 foot ascent
with only the single rope they came down on

BLAKE
Going down was the easy part huh

TAKA
Did no one think we’d have to go
back up I can’t climb that look
at my arms they’re like
hummingbirds’ legs

WELLS
(tries his walkie)
Shit it’s just static this far
down

INSERT Elsewhere flames from the cavern start to spread
trailing out into the tunnels

BACK TO SCENE

Blake is the first to attempt climbing the rope he only gets
about ten feet up before his arms give out

BLAKE
This ain’t happening I’m too
exhausted from lugging around
Deputy Could-Lose-Ten-Pounds

John peers down one of the tunnels sees a glow growing in
the distance-- THE FIRE IS HEADED TOWARD THEM

JOHN
Guys we’re running out of time

A sobering realization begins to set in

BLAKE
Well we got any more of that weed

Then suddenly

CAMERON (0S)
He111000000000

Everyone looks up seeing the tiny dot of Cameron’s head
against the moonlit sky Andy and Brian are with him as well

TAKA
Holy shit Cameron is that you
CAMERON
Yo Who’s down there

Everyone shouts at once

SERIES

- Future engineering major Cameron improvises a pulley

CAMERON (CONTD)
Oh hey you guys Whatcha doing--

EVERYONE
GET US OUT OF HERE

with the rope

system

- Succession of each of our group members being lifted out of

the pit

EXT FRACKING SITE -- LATER

Exhausted but thankful this horrible day is over everyone
congratulates each other

WELLS
How did you guys find us

CAMERON
You didn’t think we’d just let the
coolest thing ever to happen in my
house just vanish into the night
without any proof

Cameron holds up a small camera

TAKA
(to Leah)
See I told you he had cameras

CAMERON
After the fire-department left we
snuck out and picked-up the trail
of destruction and it lead us here

LEAH
Cameron I could seriously kiss
you

Cameron eyes well-up with hope

LEAH (CONT’D)
But I’m not

Cameron deflates

LEAH (CONTD)
I’m saving it for someone else

She smiles and turns to John Everyone childishly
“Qo0000S”

LEAH (CONTD)
You kicked that thing’s ass

JOHN
(smiles )
Not by myself

LEAH
That’s what we’re here for Don’t
ever think you’re alone with
anything this stupid world throws
at you And especially because you
have me

Finally the two slowly move in for their much delayed
kiss

EVERYONE TURNS WATCHING IN HORROR AS THE ALPHA CLIMBS OUT OF
THE PIT looking like a demon-dog from Hell

The beast is horribly burned its skin has melted away
revealing bloody charred muscle and sinew If it was scary
looking before it’s a mother-fuckin’ nightmare now

Screams of terror Cameron shrieks pauses to take a
picture then continues shrieking

The beast charges directly at John and Leah as the two cling
to each other-- this is really the end

HONK HONK HONK
From out of nowhere Justin speeds through the group ramming
into the Alpha with his prize Camaro the front end smashes

in as the car catapults the beast back into the FIREY PIT

Justin and Chet open their doors and roll out of the car
right before it too topples into the pit

INSERT The Alpha slams onto the pit floor it’s only able to
let out a short bellow before the Camaro SMASHES DOWN ON IT

BACK TO SCENE

An eruption of joy not seen since the celebration at the Ewok
Village Leah runs up to her brother and hugs him Justin
softens as he hugs his little sister back

JUSTIN
You are my family

After a tender moment Leah pulls away from her brother
beaming at him

JUSTIN (CONTD)
But you still owe me fifty bucks

CHET
(re his joint)
Dude I am telling you best shit
ever

Back with group Leah throws her arms around John’s neck the
two pull close finally sharing their first kiss

Looking on Taka throws his arm around Blake smiling

BLAKE
I swear to God if you try to kiss
me I will punch your taint

WELLS
What the Hell am I going to tell
all your parents

KEVIN
Hey who’s gonna pay for all the
equipment
Cameron holds up his camera triumphant
CAMERON

Don’t worry this photo is gonna
make us rich

WITH JOHN and LEAH
The two pull away just for a moment smile and kiss again
TAKA

Yeeeeahnice and slow Johnny
just how she likes it

Without looking or breaking from their lip-lock Leah punches
Taka in the face

I’m willing to take it Needless
to say Omni-Tech is finished in

INT NON-DESCRIPT OFFICE -- DAY

The back of an executive leather chair an unseen figure
speaks on the phone

FIGURE (0S)

Yes I can assure you sir the
situation has been completely
contained Omni-Tech remains the
face of all operations

(pause)
no all information leaks have
been redirected through proper

town nobodies It will all be
lumped in with conspiracy theories
and Big Foot sightings

(pause)
Thank you sir Thank you very much
There’s just one more question
that’s been lingering since the
onset of the events

The leather chair swivels around revealing BRYAN CRANSTON
or some big actor cameo He wears a general’s uniform four
stars across the chest

GENERAL
When will phase three begin

SMASH TO BLACK
