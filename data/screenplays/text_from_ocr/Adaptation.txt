for I suffer from a condition called Body
Dysmorphic Disorder I am fat but am I
as fat as I think My therapist says no
but people lie I believe others call me
Fatty behind my back Or Fatso Or
facetiously Slim But I also believe
this is simply my own perverted form of
self-aggrandizement that no one really
talks about me at all What possible
interest is an old bald fat man to
anyone I am repulsive I have never

of many kinds with birds singing

Laroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing

breasts She looks up at him He blanches looks away

KAUFMAN (VO)
Im old Im bald Im repulsive

VALERIE
We think youre just great

KAUFMAN
(with studied modesty)
Oh thank you
Valerie absently rubs her nose Kaufman self-consciously

rubs his nose in response

VALERIE
And were thrilled youre interested

Valerie rubs her nose again Kaufman pulls at his nostril

A rivulet of sweat slides down his forehead Valerie watches
it Kaufman sees her watching it She sees him seeing her
watching it She looks at her salad He quickly swabs

entitled The Orchid Thief from his bag

KAUFMAN
First I think its a great book

VALERIE
Laroche is a fun character isnt he

Kaufman nods flips through the book stalling Theres a
smiling author photo of Susan Orlean on the inside back
cover

KAUFMAN
And Orlean makes orchids so fascinating
Plus her musings on Florida orchid
poaching Indians Great sprawling New
Yorker stuff Id want to remain true to
that let the movie exist rather than be
artificially plot driven

VALERIE
Okay great great I guess Im not
exactly sure what that means

KAUFMAN
Oh Well Im not sure exactly yet
either So yknow its
VALERIE
Oh Okay Great So um what --

KAUFMAN
Its just I dont want to compromise by
making it a Hollywood product An orchid
heist movie Or changing the orchids
into poppies and turning it into a movie
about drug running Yknow

VALERIE
Oh of course We agree Definitely

KAUFMAN
Or cramming in sex or car chases or
guns Or characters learning profound
life lessons Or characters growing or
characters changing or characters
learning to like each other or characters
overcoming obstacles to succeed in the
end Yknow Movie shit

Kaufman is sweating like crazy now Valerie is quiet for a
moment

VALERIE
See we thought maybe Susan Orlean and
Laroche could fall in love during the

MARGARET

flowers So complex

Margaret plops onto the couch next to Kaufman

KAUFMAN

wild flower And after you learn all

KAUFMAN
(thrilled but controlled)
Thatd be fun

MARGARET
God theyre such beautiful flowers And

(whispering)
Did you know that orchid means --

KAUFMAN
Testicle I just read that

MARGARET
(shrieks with delight)
Testicle Can you believe it

Margaret giggles happily Kaufman giggles weirdly

MARGARET (contd)
I swear itd be fucking great for

profound lessons Jesus isnt nature
enough

fungus or whatever Id like to be more
like that See I tend to write self-
involved self-loathing even
masturbatory stuff

VALERIE
And its wonderful by the way

KAUFMAN
Thanks Thats nice to hear But I need
to challenge myself as a writer Ive
arrived at an age where I want to think
about the world in a different way

VALERIE

Adapting someone elses work is certainly

an opportunity to think differently

KAUFMAN
Yes And I welcome the challenge of
taking a small subject like orchids
something that would never draw people
into a theater and making that
fascinating I want to show people
heaven in a wildflower As Blake wrote

begins sawing through the tree

The entrees arrive

MARGARET (contd)
struck by his notion that history is
a human construct

Kaufman begins the laborious task of getting through his
plate of food He can no longer look up at Margaret

historically but rather cyclically
(MORE)

So whereas human history spirals forward
building upon itself nature

fatality of getting them almost as much
as he loved the orchids themselves

EXT JANES SCENIC DRIVE - MORNING
Tony steps out of his truck Laroche smiles warmly
TONY
Morning May I ask what you gentlemen

nine orchid varieties About a hundred
and thirty plants all told which my
colleagues have removed from the swamp

endangered sir Every one of them

TONY
Exactly Well thats exactly the issue
This is a state preserve

LAROCHE

Yes sir it is

(afterthought)
Oh and my colleagues are all Seminole
Indians Did I mention that Youre
familiar Im sure with the State of
Florida v James E Billie

Tony nods even though he has no idea

LAROCHE (contd)
So you know that even though Seminole
Chief Billie killed a Florida panther
one of what forty in the entire world

Laroche looks to the Indians for confirmation

LAROCHE (contd)
The state couldnt successfully prosecute
him Because hes an Indian and its his
right As repugnant as you or I as white
conservationists might find his actions

TONY
But --

They give it

LAROCHE
Not to mention the failed attempts on
three separate occasions to prosecute
Seminoles for poaching palm fronds
which I believe they use to thatch the
roofs of their traditional chickee huts

Laroche again looks to the Indians for confirmation
RUSSELL
Hes right Thats exactly what we use

them for Chickee huts

Tony looks at the Indians

RANDY

VINSON

INT RENTAL CAR - DAY

We watch Orlean as she drives out of the Miami Airport
parking lot onto the freeway past congestion and
billboards Her mournful face glows beautifully
dramatically with golden sunlight She talks to us

ORLEAN
Nothing in Florida seems hard or
permanent The developed places are just
little clearings in the jungle but the
jungle is unstoppably fertile everything
is always growing or expanding At the
same time the wilderness disappears
before your eyes

Orlean gets quiet Her eyes tear

girls walk by Kaufman watches as one whispers to the other
He thinks he hears the word Fatso The girls giggle

INT EMPTY HOUSE - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER

Kaufman passes a hall mirror regards himself glumly and
climbs the stairs

KAUFMAN (VO)
I am fat I am repulsive I cannot bear
my own reflection

At the landing Kaufman comes upon Donald his identical twin
brother on his back in pajama bottoms opening a gift box

DONALD
Did you open your present from mom yet

KAUFMAN
Whats with you

DONALD

Kaufman nods vaguely continues down the hall Donald pulls
a purple sweater from the box calls after Kaufman

DONALD (contd)
Hey Charles youll be glad I have a
plan to get me out of your house pronto

KAUFMAN
A job is a plan Is your plan a job

DONALD
(big build up)
Im gonna be a screenwriter Like you
Kaufman doesnt respond enters his bedroom

DONALD (contd)
I know you think this is just one of my
get-rich-quick schemes But Im doing it
right this time Im taking a seminar

INT EMPTY BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Kaufman lies face down on his mattress on the floor

DONALD (0S)
Its only five hundred bucks

KAUFMAN
(muffled by pillow)
Screenwriting seminars are bullshit

Kaufman pulls a copy of Variety open to a photo of Margaret
from under his pillow He gets lost in the picture

DONALD (0S)
In theory I agree with you But this one
is highly regarded within the industry

KAUFMAN
Donald dont say industry

Donald now in the sweater appears on all fours in the
doorway Kaufman puts the paper back under his pillow

DONALD
Im sorry I forgot Charles this guy
knows screenwriting People from all
over come to study his method Ill pay
you back man As soon as I sell --

KAUFMAN
Let me explain something to you

DONALD
Yeah okay

KAUFMAN
Anybody who says hes got the answer is
going to attract desperate people Be it
in the world of religion --

DONALD
(indicating his back)

I just need to lie down while you explain
this to me Sorry I apologize

(lies down stares at ceiling)
Okay go ahead Sorry Okay Go

KAUFMAN
There are no rules to follow Donald and
anybody who says there are is just --

DONALD
Not rules principles McKee writes
A rule says you must do it this way A
principle says this works and has
through all remembered time
KAUFMAN
The script Im starting its about
flowers No ones ever done a movie
about flowers before So therere no
guidelines and thats good because --
DONALD
What about Flowers for Algernon
KAUFMAN
Thats not about flowers And its not a
movie
DONALD
Oh okay I never saw it Go ahead
KAUFMAN

My point is those teachers are dangerous
if your goal is to do something new And
a writer should always have that goal
Writing is a journey into the unknown
Its not building a model airplane

Donald stares at the ceiling fuming Kaufman waits
Getting no no response he pulls out his Hegel book and

reads

KAUFMAN (VO)
Each being is because posited an op-
posited a conditional and conditioning
the Understanding completes these its
limitations by positing the opposite
Kaufmans head is spinning He puts the book down Both
brothers stare at the ceiling Donald finally speaks

DONALD
McKee is a former Fulbright scholar Are
you a former Fulbright scholar Charles

Silence of the Lambs meets Psycho

KAUFMAN
Hey maybe you and mom could collaborate
I hear shes really good with structure

DONALD
You think youre so superior Charles
Well Im really gonna write this And
youll see And and you suck okay

The two glare at each other They go back to their books

KAUFMAN (VO)
Florida is a landscape of transition

DONALD (V0O)
Do not proliferate characters do not
multiply locations Rather than
hopscotching through time space and
people discipline yourself to a
reasonably contained cast and world

INT RENTAL CAR - DAY

Orlean drives on State Road 29 past prefab housing into
swampland She talks to us

ORLEAN
Florida is a landscape of transition and
mutation a hybrid of unruliness and
orderliness nature and artifice

She brushes a wisp of hair from her face and tucks it behind
her small pretty ear We linger on the ear which grows
pink with sunlight Orlean catches us and smiles shyly

INT EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY

Kaufman traces a stubby nail-bitten finger along State Road
29 along a Florida road map He turns to his typewriter and
types in a clumsy hunt-and-peck style

Laroche in a Miami Hurricanes cap wrap-around Mylar
sunglasses and a Hawaiian shirt is on the stand Alan
Lerner the tribes lawyer questions him

Finally Mr Laroche what is your
experience in the area of horticulture

LAROCHE

Okay Ive been a professional
horticulturist for twelve years Ive
owned a plant nursery of my own which was
destroyed by the hurricane Ima
professional plant lecturer Ive given
at least sixty lectures on the
cultivation of plants Im a published
author both in magazine and book form
I have extensive experience with orchids
and the asexual micropropagation of
orchids under aseptic cultures This is
laboratory work not at all like your
nursery work

(grins)
Im probably the smartest person I know

LERNER
Thank you

LAROCHE
Youre very welcome

INT BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY

As she rings up his books Kaufman admires the cashiers
flower tattoo She catches him and smiles with red wet
pierced lips She unbuttons her blouse and shows him a breast
with a heart tattoo A sweet heartbeat turns to knocking

INT EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman in bed masturbating looks up at the closed door

KAUFMAN
What
The door opens Donald stands there for a moment in shadows
DONALD

Look you wanna hear my pitch or what

KAUFMAN
Go away God damn it

DONALD
(lost)
Yknow Im just trying to do something

Kaufman squints at his brother sits up waits

DONALD (CONTD)
Hey thanks a lot man Cool
(flicks on light then in pitch
mode )
Okay theres this serial killer right --

Kaufman groans lies down pulls the covers over his face

DONALD (CONTD)
No wait See hes being hunted by a
cop And hes taunting the cop right
Sending clues who his next victim is
Hes already holding her hostage in his
creepy basement So the cop gets
obsessed with figuring out her identity
and in the process he falls in love with
her Even though hes never even met
her She becomes like the
unattainable like the Holy Grail

KAUFMAN
(through a blanket)
Its a little obvious dont you think

DONALD
Okay but theres a twist See we find
out the killer suffers from multiple
personality disorder Okay See hes
really also the cop and the girl All of
them Its all him Isnt that crazy

Donald waits proud Kaufman pulls off the covers

KAUFMAN
Look the only idea more overused than
serial killers is multiple personality
On top of that you explore the notion
that cop and criminal are really two
aspects of the same person See every
cop movie ever made for other examples of
this

DONALD
Mom called it psychologically taut

KAUFMAN
The other thing is theres no way to
write this Did you consider that I
mean how exactly would you show a
character holding himself hostage

DONALD
Trick photography

KAUFMAN
Okay thats not what Im asking What
Im asking is in the reality of this
movie if theres only one character
right Okay How could you What
exactly would the scene How

Donald waits blankly Kaufman gives up gets out of bed
dresses

KAUFMAN (contd)
I agree with mom Very taut Sybil
meets I dunno something very taut

Kaufman exits

LAROCHE

Laroche screeching to a stop in his banged-up van

ORLEAN
(to camera)
A few days after the hearing Laroche
took me to an orchid show in Miami

She opens the passenger door
ORLEAN (contd)
Hi Thanks for picking --

LAROCHE
I want you to know this van is a piece of
shit When I hit the jackpot Ill buy
myself an awesome car maybe an Aurora

Orlean nods climbs in and tries to rearrage some of the
junk on the front seat so shell have a place to sit

She situates herself on the seat Laroche lurches off

INT VAN - DAY

Laroche drives manically Orlean watches the road and holds
one hand against the dashboard

LAROCHE
The thing you gotta know is my whole life
is looking for a goddamn profitable
plant And thats the ghost

ORLEAN
Why the ghost orchid

LAROCHE

The suckers rare Collectors covet what
is not available Im the only one in
the world who knows how to cultivate it

He looks at her and smiles Orlean smiles back and
indicates with a small jerk of the head that he might want
to watch the road He doesnt take the hint

LAROCHE (contd)

The plan was get the Indians to pull it
from the swamp I researched it As

long as I dont touch the plants Florida
cant touch us Then Id clone hundreds
of them babies in my lab sell ‘em and
make the Seminoles a shitload of change

In handwriting made jerky by the bouncing van Orlean writes
shitload of change on her notepad
LAROCHE (contd)
And I stop future poaching by making the
flowers readily available in stores
Then I give a big speech at the trial
about how the legislature should get rid
of loopholes smart people like me can
find Im a hero The flowers are
saved Laroche and nature win

See that nectary all the way down there
Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose
twelve inches long to pollinate it
Everyone thought he was a loon Then
sure enough they found this moth with a
twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means
nose by the way -- and --

ORLEAN

I know what proboscis means

LAROCHE
Every one of these flowers has a specific
relationship with the insect that
pollinates it Theres an orchid that
looks exactly like this particular
insect So the bug humps the flower and
gets covered with its pollen Thusly

Laroche mimes humping

ORLEAN
I get it

LAROCHE
Thats called pseudo-copulation These
flowers are smart You gotta fall in
love with them Once you learn anything
about orchids youll devote your life to
learning everything about them

Orlean looks around people sniffing flowers feeling petals
staring deep into nectaries People jabber passionately
people buy plants people carry boxes of purchased plants

The sky is overcast Mike Owen leads Kaufman through a cool
swamp which is completely dry The two men walk easily on
peaty ground Kaufman slathered with sun screen and covered
head to foot in unnecessary protective clothing tries to be
interested in Owens lecture

MIKE OWEN
So the whole ecosystem is six thousand
years old Five to six thousand years
old About that Five or six

KAUFMAN
Okay

MIKE OWEN

the cyrpess strands probably in the
world I dont know of any cypress

Mike Owen

holds a handful of peat Kaufman looks at it

MIKE OWEN
The oldest carbon dating theyve done on
any of the peat out here is fifty-seven
hundred years Thats with carbon-14
(MORE)

MIKE OWEN (contd)
Thats in the right age where you can
really date things accurately with carbon-
14 because its half-life is fifty-five
hundred years so they must have found
have of it gone and figured that

KAUFMAN
Why isnt it wet Orlean wrote about
wading through black corrosive water
She said it was the scariest experience
of her life And when I spoke to you on
the phone you said wear heavy boots
long pants and

MIKE OWEN
Theres usually water Weve been going
through a bit of a drought Say have
you seen that movie Medicine Man
Thats a good movie about protecting
nature It shows there could be
something important in a rain forest we
dont even know about like a cure for
cancer

KAUFMAN
Its not even hot I was expecting it to
be awful Sun beating down wading
through water looking out for snakes
wild hogs I was thinking it would be

The alligators are over by the lakes
The temperatures a blessing for us

There are certainly ghosts in the
Fakahatchee -- ghosts of rangers who were
murdered years ago by illegal plume
hunters and of loggers who were cut to
pieces in fights and for years there has
been an apparition wandering the swamp
the Swamp Ape which is said to be seven
feet tall and seven hundred pounds and
have the physique of a human the posture
of an ape and the body odor of a skunk

EXT RANGER SHACK - DAY

Kaufman and Owen stand by Kaufmans car

Kaufman is desperate for something else

MIKE OWEN
What Laroche did was wrong Those
flowers belong to all of us all 250
million of us -- 250 I think its up to
270 now -- And belonging to all of us
means they belong to none of us Nobody
has a right to take them Not me not
you not John Laroche not

KAUFMAN
Listen um Susan Orlean wrote about a
legendary creature called a Swamp Ape

whove walked too long in the swamp

INT ORLEANS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Orlean types Its pouring and sheets of rain beat against
her window She glances at her husband across the room
reading a book She sighs continues typing

to imagine and easy to fall in love with
but a little fantastic and fleeting and
out of reach

Pause
GUY ON BENCH
I moved down here for a change and I
wrote the screenplay Just like that
Its a great idea
The old guy waits for a response He gets none

GUY ON BENCH (contd)

Its about a mob guy but its not your
regular mob story Theres a twist A
cop tells this mob guys wife that the
mob guys cheating on her But the truth
is the cops lying because he wants her
for himself See they used to go
together in high school

(waits for response then)
You know anything about screenplays

Kaufman shakes his head

GUY ON BENCH (contd)
Well the object is to make people think

nowhere Well not nowhere

(beat)
Im a born again Christian

(beat)
You have faith

KAUFMAN

GUY ON BENCH (contd)
I dont know how you can look out at this
beautiful ocean and not believe theres
an intelligence that created it

KAUFMAN
I dont know

GUY ON BENCH

Well you cant know until you experience
it That requires accepting Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior Believe me
Lookit if I was to show you a bottle of
clear liquid and told you it was vodka

it was water Theres only one way

KAUFMAN
Id smell it

lamp pulls The Orchid Thief from his bag flips through it
There are now many yellow hi-lited passages He reads one

KAUFMAN (VO)
There are too many ideas and things and
people too many directions to go I was
starting to believe the reason it matters
to care passionately about something is
that it whittles the world down to a more
manageable size

KAUFMAN
Such sweet sad insights So true

Kaufman flips to the glowing smiling author photo

KAUFMAN
And youre I like looking at you
He stares at the photo Its smile broadens It talks

INT CAR - DAY

Orlean drives through swampy landscape She talks to us

ORLEAN
I suppose what Id been doing in Florida
was trying to understand how people found
order and contentment and a sense of
purpose in the universe by fixing their
sighs on one single desire Now I was
also trying to understand how someone
could end such intense desire without a
trace

Orlean stops at a payphone and dials It rings for a while

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

(groggy)
Yeah what

ORLEAN
Hello John its Susan

LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)

Kaufman paces with his mini-recorder Off-screen typing

KAUFMAN

and in the final sequence Susan as a
young girl swings alone in the backyard
From high in the air she sees her parents
in separate rooms staring blankly in

became afraid to ever really love
something because it would go away

Kaufman is immensely pleased He smiles at Orleans photo

Donald appears in the doorway with a script

KAUFMAN
What What do you want
DONALD
I finished My script Im done

Kaufman stares at his typewriter doesnt say anything

DONALD (contd)
So would you show it to your agent

Kaufman grabs Donalds script and throws it on his bed

DONALD (contd)
Thanks Also I wanted to thank you for
your idea It was very helpful I
changed it a little Now the killer cuts
off body pieces and makes the victims eat
them Its like I once saw this
picture of a snake swallowing its tail --

Kaufman collapses puts his head in his hands

KAUFMAN
Ourobouros

DONALD
I dont know what that means

KAUFMAN
The snake is called Ourobouros

DONALD
I dont think so But its cool for my
killer to have this modus operandi
Because at the end when he forces the
woman whos really just him to eat
herself hes also eating himself to
death

KAUFMAN
Im insane Im Ourobouros

DONALD
I dont know what that is

KAUFMAN
Ive written myself into my screenplay
Its eating itself Im eating myself

DONALD
Oh Thats kinda weird

KAUFMAN
Its self-indulgent Its narcissistic
Its solipsistic Its pathetic Im
pathetic Im fat and pathetic

DONALD
Im sure you had a good reason Charles
Youre an artist

KAUFMAN
The reason is Im too timid to speak to
the woman who wrote the book Because
Im pathetic Because I have no idea how
to write Because I cant make flowers
fascinating Because I suck

DONALD
Hey am I in the script too

KAUFMAN
Im going to New York Ill meet her
Thats it Thats what I have to do

DONALD
Dont get mad at me for saying this
Charles but Bobs got a seminar in New
York this weekend So if youre stuck --
Kaufman shoots Donald a look
INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER
The lights are off Orlean is in bed sleeping fitfully
INT PLANE - NIGHT
Kaufman reads Ann Landerss column in a paper dated July 4th
KAUFMAN (VO)
Give yourself a reality check Phoniness
is transparent and it is tiresome Take
pleasure in the beauty and wonders of
nature A flower is Gods miracle
Out the window he sees colorful fireworks far down below
like small flowers blooming on the black earth His eyes
well with tears
INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman sleeps fitfully

EXT SWAMP - DAY

Orlean walks through alone panicked All the vegetation is
greener and crazier-looking than weve seen before Things
slither by in the water brush up against her

She tenses steps into a sinkhole flails gets tangled ina
vine which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate
herself She falls face forward into the black water
INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Orlean snaps awake bedcovers tangled around her legs She
heaves looks at the clock Its 330 She stares at the
ceiling She looks at the clock again Its 330 She

looks at the clock again Its 410 She closes her eyes
She opens them looks at the clock the room is filled with
murky water the bed an island of dryness An alligator
pokes its nose out of the water begins to climb onto the
bed Orlean jumps back hits her head on the headboard The
room is back to normal The clock reads 423 She closes
her eyes The alarm goes off

EXT LAROCHES HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Orlean pulls up to the curb where Laroche stands dressed in
a short sleeve shirt thin pants and his Miami Hurricanes
hat He opens the door and climbs in

ORLEAN
Where are our supplies

LAROCHE
Got everything I need right here

Laroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket
Orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering
wheel Laroche shrugs

LAROCHE (contd)
Look dont worry about it Well get
crap at the Indian trading post on
Alligator Alley Hey want me to drive

INT CAR - A BIT LATER

The sun has come up strong It looks hot Laroche speeds
along with one finger on the wheel paying little attention
to the road The car veers onto the shoulder he lazily
corrects it Orlean is tense

LAROCHE
I remember one time when I was a kid
fifteen or so my mother and I came to
the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to
photograph We walked for hours through
the most intense heat Id ever felt We
couldnt find one I wanted to turn
back But my mom said no

(MORE)

LAROCHE (contd)
She said John if you keep searching for
something past doubt past hopelessness
past the absolute certainty that youll
never find it if you keep searching past
that there itll be So we walked I

had goddamn bloody blisters on my feet
And we found ourselves in this charred
prairie desolate sun blasted yknow
And there in the middle of it was this
one gorgeous snowy Polyrrhiza lindenii

They drive in silence for a little while She watches him

INT OFFICE - DAY

Orlean types at her desk She turns to us and talks

ORLEAN
He made it sound like a Bible story the
hopeful journey through darkness into
light I never thought many people in
the world were like John but I was
realizing more and more that Laroche was
an extreme not an aberration -- most
people in some way or another do strive
for something exceptional something to
pursue even at their peril rather than
abide an ordinary life

EXT MIDTOWN NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Kaufman sweaty and anxious walks along He arrives at the
New Yorker building and enters with steely determination

INT BUILDING - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Kaufman waits for the elevator sweating even more profusely
The elevator doors open People get off people get on the
elevator doors close Kaufman still stands there

EXT SWAMP - MORNING

Laroche and Orlean step off the levee into black water They
sink to their knees The ground is soft its a struggle to
pull their feet up to walk Things slither past in the
water Something big runs by in the distance Bees and
dragonflies hover Gnats and mosquitoes bite Birds

screech Frogs croak Laroche points to a yellow flower

LAROCHE
Here we go Encyclia tempensis

Laroche lights a cigarette

LAROCHE (contd)
Nice little sucker isnt it

Orlean examines it from a distance

ORLEAN
Cute

Laroche continues walking and Orlean attempts to keep pace
He points at a tiny orchid on another tree

LAROCHE
Clamshell orchid You know that

ORLEAN
Uh-huh

LAROCHE
See I found you two already Ill show
you every orchid you want today Ill
find you a fucking ghost if it kills me
(pointing to another orchid)
Rigid Epidendrum Thats an ugly-ass
orchid But Im no snob Im interested
in all orchids Not just pretty ones

times people get off and on Kaufman sweats The doors
open The New Yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite
the elevator Nobody gets off or on The doors close The
elevator continues up Kaufman hates himself Soon the
elevator is emptied out with the exception of Kaufman It
begins its descent and stops once again at the New Yorker
This time Orlean gets on Kaufman is absolutely panicked
Orlean looks at him blankly presses lobby and faces

elevator arrives at the lobby Orlean gets out Kaufman
hesitates then follows

EXT NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Orlean walks along Kaufman follows her

Orlean looks up from her magazine and smiles at the waitress

ORLEAN

The waitress nods and leaves Kaufman scribbles

KAUFMAN (VO)
Likes lemon in tea and her voice is not
at all what I imagined Interesting

EXT SWAMP - NOON

Orlean follows Laroche She watches him start off in one
direction stop start off another direction then go
straight ahead Orlean seems depressed

ORLEAN
Laroche can I ask you a personal
question

Laroche turns and scowls at her

LAROCHE

EXT NYC STREET - DAY

Orlean window shops at a shoe store Kaufman takes notes

KAUFMAN (VO)

Orlean heads down the street Kaufman follows She enters
the New Yorker building Kaufman waits outside

EXT SWAMP - DAY

The sun is hot Laroche is twenty feet ahead of Orlean She
watches him march forward with great authority She massages
her eyebrows leaving a residue of dirt on her face

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Kaufman reviews his notes He is sweaty and wild-eyed

KAUFMAN (VO)
I have nothing I am nothing I am fat
I am over I am lost

EXT SWAMP - LATER

The sun is high Orlean and Laroche sit on dry ground She
stares at him Laroche wont look at her He busies himself
opening the backpack and pulling out food Finally Laroche
speaks without looking up

LAROCHE

Laroche takes out a cigarette lights it

LAROCHE (contd)
Im just turned around a little

He looks up at her sees her staring at him He pokes around
on the ground for something comes up with a straight twig

LAROCHE (contd)
A sundial Ill just set this up wait a
few minutes and well be able to tell
which way the sun is moving We want to
be heading southeast

Laroche sticks the twig into the ground stares at it

LAROCHE (contd)
This is no big deal You should eat
something

Orlean takes a cracker This relaxes Laroche He stretches
his legs knocks over the twig Without looking at Orlean
he puts the twig back

LAROCHE (contd)
So do you collect anything

ORLEAN
(non-responsive)
Not really

LAROCHE
Well yknow its not really about
collecting the thing its about --

ORLEAN
The sundial isnt working

Laroche looks down at it

LAROCHE
It is so working

Orlean stares at the twig in the ground She looks at
Laroche Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean Rage and
panic sweep across her face her fists clench into balls
Her eyes become wild some dark fantasy plays out in her
brain Laroche seems unaware

LAROCHE (contd)
The thing about computers The thing I
like is that Im immersed in it but its
not a living thing thats going to leave
or die or something I prefer having the
minimum number of living things to worry
about in my life

Orleans anger softens She looks sadly at Laroche
ORLEAN
So John
LAROCHE

Okay fuck the sundial Well just go
straight and eventually well get there

They rise
LAROCHE (contd)
What I mean is well get somewhere Out
of here I mean logically we have to
get out as long as we walk straight

Laroche points them in a direction and they walk

EXT NYC STREETS (MONTAGE) - MORNING

Kaufman wanders He eyes other sad-looking balding
overweight men wandering the streets also

KAUFMAN (VO)
I am fat I cant write I am
repulsive I am old I have
accomplished nothing I am just one more
old fat bald man on the street

EXT SWAMP - DAY

Laroche leads the way Theres a sadness a sense of defeat
and humiliation that he tries to conceal Orlean is stony

LAROCHE
Ive done this a million times Whenever
everythings killing me I just say to
myself screw it and go straight ahead
Laroche leads Orlean back into the brush

EXT NYC STREET - MORNING

Kaufman sees a white school building ahead glowing in the
sun He walks toward it

INT LOBBY - MORNING
The lobby of an auditorium crowded with enthusiastic people
signing up for something Kaufman waits in line He
watches the handsome guy ahead of him flirt with an
attractive female registrar The guy moves on and the
attractive registrar looks without interest at Kaufman

REGISTRAR
May I help you

Kaufman averts his eyes from her cool gaze they come to rest
on a pile of McKees book Story next to her

INT AUDITORIUM - A BIT LATER

Kaufman sits in the packed room McKee paces the stage with
a mic clipped to his lapel

MCKEE
Years from now youll be standing around
a posh cocktail party congratulating
yourself on how you spent an entire
weekend locked in a room with an asshole
an opinionated arrogant asshole for your
art

The audience laughs except for Kaufman who looks pained

KAUFMAN (VO)

I am pathetic I ama loser I am fat
MCKEE
So what is the substance of writing

Nothing as trivial as words is at the
heart of this great art my friends

McKee continues to talk but his voice goes under

KAUFMAN (VO)
I have failed I am panicked I am fat
I have sold out I am worthless I

MCKEE
Literary talent is not enough First
last and always the imperative is to
tell a story

Kaufman watches with disdain as people take notes

MCKEE
Twenty three hundred years ago Aristotle
said when storytelling goes bad ina
society the result is decadence
(deadpan)
Well just look around you

Everyone except Kaufman laughs giddily at McKees joke

MCKEE (contd)
Aristotle also said A story must have a
beginning a middle and an end

The students nod in appreciation at this profundity

INT AUDITORIUM - LATER

McKee scribbles a diagram onto a transparency in an overhead
projector Its some kind of complicated time-line with act-
breaks and corresponding page numbers indicated The
audience members take copious notes Kaufman sweats

KAUFMAN (VO)

It is my weakness my ultimate lack of
conviction that brings me here with all
these desperate idiots lapping up
everything this bag of wind spouts Easy
answers Rules to short-cut yourself to
success And here I am because my jaunt
into the abyss brought me nothing Well
isnt that the risk one takes for
attempting something new I should leave
here right now Ill start over --

(starts to rise)
I need to face this project head on and --

MCKEE
and God help you if you use voice-
over in your work my friends

Kaufman stops looks up startled McKee seems to be looking
at him

MCKEE
God fucking help you Its flaccid
sloppy writing Any idiot can write
voice-over narration to explain the
thoughts of a character You must
present the internal conflicts of your
character in image in symbol Film is a
medium of movement and image

Kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks Any
idiot writes the guy on one side of him Flaccid
writes the guy on the other side
Okay

MCKEE (contd)

one hour for lunch

EXT NYC STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Students exit onto the street in small groups Kaufman
wanders by himself His face is troubled There is no sound

INT AUDITORIUM

McKee lectures

LATER

Kaufman sits and listens A copy of
Aristotles Poetics sits on his lap The book features a
bust of Aristotle on the cover

MCKEE

You want your writing to be original
You want to have an original voice like
Neil Simon or Nora Ephron Well let me
tell you something my friends The key
to originality is not eccentricity

A guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative mmmm

INT AUDITORIUM

DISSOLVE TO

LATER

Its late The audience is tired but still attentive Now
Kaufman takes serious notes McKee energetic as ever wears
his sweater tied around his shoulders We stay firmly
planted on his face as he talks and talks

MCKEE

Long speechs are antithetical to the
nature of cinema The Greeks called it
stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of
ideas A long speech in a script say a
page long requires that the camera hold
on the actors face for a minute Look
at the second hand on your watch as it
makes one complete rotation around the
clock face and youll get an idea of how
intolerable that would be for an
audience The ontology of the screen is
that its always now and its always
action and its always vivid Life is
rarely vivid And thats an important
point We are not recreating life on the
screen
Have you ever eavesdropped on people
talking in a coffee shop Then you know
how dull and tedious real conversation

Writers are not tape recorders
is Real people are not interesting
Theres not a person in this world -- and
I include myself in this -- who would be
interesting enough to take as is and put
in a movie as a character
DISSOLVE TO

INT AUDITORIUM - LATER STILL
McKee faces the audience holding a cup of coffee

MCKEE
Someone asked me recently Bob do you
think Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty

He pauses theatrically sips his coffee then
MCKEE (contd)
(deadpan)
Michelle Pfeiffer is proof my friends

that theres a fucking God

The overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter
Kaufman with dark circles under his eyes giggles a little

MCKEE (contd)

Okay Thats it for tonight Remember

therell be a Q and A tomorrow morning

before class starts
INT HOTEL - NIGHT
Kaufman tosses and turns in bed

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DREAM-LIKE FIELD - DAY
The daguerreotype Darwin the Aristotle sculpture the Hegel
engraving and the Orlean book jacket photo are alive and in
the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight
INT AUDITORIUM - MORNING

Kaufman bleary-eyed sits in the back McKee paces

MCKEE
Anyone else

Kaufman timidly raises his hand
MCKEE (contd)
Yes

KAUFMAN
You talked about Crisis as the ultimate
decision a character makes but what if a
writer is attempting to create a story
where nothing much happens where people
dont change they dont have any
epiphanies They struggle and are
frustrated and nothing is resolved More
a reflection of the real world --

MCKEE
The real world The real fucking world
First of all if you write a screenplay
without conflict or crisis youll bore
your audience to tears Secondly
Nothing happens in the real world Are
you out of your fucking mind People are
murdered every day Theres genocide and
war and corruption Every fucking day
somewhere in the world somebody
sacrifices his life to save someone else
Every fucking day someone somewhere makes
a conscious decision to destroy someone
else People find love People lose it
for Christs sake A child watches her
mother beaten to death on the steps of a
church Someone goes hungry Somebody
else betrays his best friend for a woman
If you cant find that stuff in life
then you my friend dont know much
about life And why the fuck are you
taking up my precious two hours with your
movie I dont have any use for it I
dont have any bloody use for it

KAUFMAN
Okay thanks

EXT NYC STREET - NIGHT
The last of the students are filing out Kaufman waits

leaning against the building McKee emerges carrying his
brown leather bag A shaky tired Kaufman approaches him
KAUFMAN
Mr McKee

MCKEE
Yes

KAUFMAN
Im the guy you yelled at this morning

MCKEE
(trying to recall)
I need more

KAUFMAN
I was the one who thought things didnt
happen in life

MCKEE
Oh right okay Nice to see you

KAUFMAN
I need to talk

MCKEE
I make it a rule not to give private
tutorials to my seminar students It
wouldnt be fair to the others

KAUFMAN
Mr McKee please My even standing here
is very scary I dont meet people well
Im self-conscious and timid But what
you said this morning shook me to the
bone What you said was bigger than my
screenwriting choices Its about my
choices as a human being Please

McKee hesitates for a moment then reaches out and puts his
arm around Kaufman

MCKEE
I could use a drink my friend

EXT SWAMP - DAY

Laroche and Orlean slog through the water with purpose
looking only straight ahead As they walk the sounds and
colors become subdued Soon there is silence
ORLEAN (VO)
We turned to the right and saw only more
cypress and palm and sawgrass

They turn left and see metal flashing in the sunlight

ORLEAN (VO) (contd)
So we turned to the left and there far
down the diagonal of the levee we could
see the gleam of a fender We followed
it like a beacon all the way to the road

Orlean and Laroche walk toward the car

INT BAR - NIGHT

Kaufman and McKee sit at a table with beers Kaufman reads
from his copy of The Orchid Thief

KAUFMAN
We followed it like a beacon all the
way to the road

Kaufman closes the book Theres a pause

MCKEE
Then what happens

KAUFMAN
Thats the book I wanted to present it
simply without big character arcs or
sensationalizing the story I wanted to
show flowers as Gods miracles I
wanted to show that Orlean never saw the
blooming ghost orchid Its about

disappointment
MCKEE
I see Thats not a movie You must go

back and put in the drama

KAUFMAN
(pause)
Ive got pages of false starts and wrong
approaches Im way past my deadline I
cant go back

MCKEE
Ah the everpresent deadline Yes I was
doing a Kojak once and it was hell

McKee sips his beer eyes Kaufman

MCKEE (contd)
Tell you a secret The last act makes
the film You can have an uninvolving
tedious movie but wow them at the end
and youve got a hit Find an ending
Use what youve learned this weekend
Give them that and youll be fine

Tears form in Kaufmans eyes

KAUFMAN
You promise

McKee smiles Kaufman hugs him McKee recognizes his bulk

MCKEE
Youve taken my course before
KAUFMAN
My brother did My twin brother Donald
Hes the one who got me to come
MCKEE
Twin screenwriters Julius and Philip
Epsteinwho wrote Casablanca were twins
KAUFMAN
You mentioned that in class
MCKEE
The finest screenplay ever written
INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
A drunken Kaufman paces tries to read Story McKees Ten
Commandments are taped to the wall As is a photo of
Michelle Pfeiffer ripped from a magazine
KAUFMAN (VO)
Climax A revolution in values from
positive to negative or negative to
positive with or without irony -- a value
swing at maximum charge thats absolute
and irreversible
Kaufman is lost He rubs his temples He dials the phone

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
Great writers residence
KAUFMAN
Donald

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
Hey hows the trip Gettin it on with
that lady journalist You dog you

KAUFMAN
Yeah Listen Im calling to say
congratulations on your script

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
Isnt that cool Jerry says he can make
me like high-sixes against a mill-five

KAUFMAN
Thats great Donald

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
I want to thank you for all your help

KAUFMAN
I wasnt any help

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
Cmon you let me stay in your place and
your integrity inspired me to even try

KAUFMAN
Well look Ive been thinking maybe
youd be interested in hanging out with
me in New York for a few days

DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
Oh my God yes Im flattered

INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Donald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the
script Kaufman paces Donald finishes is quiet

KAUFMAN
So like what would you do

DONALD
Script kind of makes fun of me huh

KAUFMAN
Sorry I was trying something I --

DONALD
Hey I dont mind Its funny
KAUFMAN
Okay So what would you do
DONALD

You and me are so different Charles
Were different talents

KAUFMAN
I know Just for fun How would the
great Donald end this script

DONALD
(giggling)
The great Donald
(serious)
Well I mean do you need the whole

court case

KAUFMAN
Uh its what happened to Laroche Its
kind of important

DONALD
Its boring No offense A courtroom
scene should be dramatic Stick the
ruling in a line of dialogue maybe

KAUFMAN
Um Okay

DONALD

Too much about orchids Get rid of it
Pare that stuff down to a minimum
Frankly Id focus more on the
relationship between the brothers I
think thats the gold here No one cares
about orchids

KAUFMAN
The books about orchids

DONALD
Thats a problem But dont let it ruin
the movie I mean for example use the
orchids in a more dramatic way Have
some kind of bang-up crazy action
sequence in the swamp Use the swamp
better Its a tremendous fictional
world A setting of great dramatic
possibility

KAUFMAN
Thats true But --

DONALD
And put some twists in Reveal some
surprising thing about Laroche God
what am I doing giving suggestions to
you I mean youre like a seasoned
professional Youre an artist

KAUFMAN
Cmon youre the mill-five kid

DONALD
(enjoying this)
Shut up
(thinks)
I love the Laroche porno web-site stuff
Is that real Maybe make a bigger deal
of that I dont know

KAUFMAN

seen the site

INT CAR - A BIT LATER
Donald drives keeping up with the van which speeds and
swerves through traffic Kaufman is sweaty nervous

KAUFMAN
Its so weird to actually see that van in

Okay but when youre creating an image
system how do you know --

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

The van pulls into the driveway of a neat middle-class

Again Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head His scalp bleeds

KAUFMAN (contd)

LAROCHE

KAUFMAN

KAUFMAN

Orlean is unforgiving

ORLEAN

LAROCHE

ORLEAN
(excited)
Really I wanted to meet --
(realizing)
Oh What does he know

(to Orlean)
We cant have this appear on the silver

KAUFMAN

ORLEAN

Orlean lies down Laroche paces Donald peers
the back window

LAROCHE
He needs to be gotten rid of

KAUFMAN
What

unseen into

Donalds eyes widen Laroche paces Orlean watches Laroche
fascinated by his every muscle movement

Orlean snaps out of her muscle fixation

his voice

LAROCHE
Small article in newspaper

his lips

LAROCHE (contd)
Screenwriter doing research for movie
about notorious orchid poacher was found
drowned in the Fakahatchee after
accidentally slipping and hitting his
head on a rock End of story Is that
credible from a journalistic standpoint

ORLEAN
Johnny come lie on top of me

LAROCHE
Focus darling Is this credible

ORLEAN
(concentrates)
Um oh this screenwriter was killed
doing research in Jamaica a few years
ago
(to Kaufman)
Screenwriter you have a car

KAUFMAN

Laroche gets ready to kick him again

KAUFMAN (contd)
A rental a rental

ORLEAN
We drive his car there leave it on the
side of the swamp That works

LAROCHE
Good I like that
ORLEAN
(to Kaufman)
Sorry
KAUFMAN
Please

Donald disappears from the window
INT RENTAL CAR - BEFORE DAWN

Kaufman drives The headlights shine on Laroches van ahead
Orlean no longer stoned sits next to him holding a gun
She skims Kaufmans screenplay

KAUFMAN
I thought I had a sense of you from your
book
(beat)
I had a little crush on you to tell the
truth Youre different than I thought

ORLEAN
Huh

KAUFMAN
Look I dont care what you two are you
doing Please dont kill me

ORLEAN

Hey heres one of my lines

(mockingly reading from screen)
Isnt it ironic You adapting my book
My three years in Florida meditating on
my inability to experience passion
resulted in my finding it with you

KAUFMAN
I was trying to do something
ORLEAN
Well its kind of pathetic dontcha
think
They drive in silence Orlean reads more of the screenplay
ORLEAN
Heres me Heres me again
(mocking)

I wanted to know what its like to care
about something passionately

Orlean laughs derisively

KAUFMAN
You can laugh but I didnt make that
line up Thats a quote from your book

ORLEAN
Yeah I know Charlie-boy Chill Im
laughing at who I used to be Its sad

KAUFMAN

So now you learned about passion
(jealous)

From Weirdo Laroche Bully for you

ORLEAN
You cant learn about passion You can
be passion And it wasnt John who made
me passion It was orchids

KAUFMAN
I thought you didnt even like orchids

ORLEAN
I lied about what happened at the end of
the book On the way out of the swamp

EXT SWAMP - DAY

Laroche leads Orlean through the swamp He spots something
on a tree circles it and stands there awestruck Orlean
comes around and sees a beautiful ghost orchid hanging from
the tree

LAROCHE
The jewel of the Fakahatchee
Orlean looks at it tries to feel some passion for it cant

ORLEAN
I still dont get it I mean there it
is I can see its pretty but --

LAROCHE
Youll get it

Laroche pulls a saw from his bag and cuts the branch

INT BASEMENT - DAY

Theres a makeshift lab Laroche is extracting some gooey
substance from the nectary

ORLEAN (VO)
Back in Johns basement he explained his
real plans for the ghost Hed
discovered a chemical inside with
psychoactive properties His plan had
always been to clone the flower and make
a fortune marketing this drug It was
Laroches kind of plan it wasnt a
controlled substance because the
government didnt know it existed

INT LAROCHES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Orlean nervously snorts some green powder off the coffee
table while Laroche watches She talks to the camera

ORLEAN
The first time I tried it the split
second it took effect I understood
orchids I loved them with a passion Id
never felt for anything For anyone

The drug takes effect and Orlean turns away from us becomes
fixated on the ghost orchid sitting on the table before her
She smells it caresses it cries at its beauty

INT RENTAL CAR - BEFORE DAWN

ORLEAN
Isnt it curious An orchid made me
passionate about orchids
KAUFMAN
Youre throwing the truth away for a
chemical confusion of your synapses --

ORLEAN
With this powder I am passionate about
everything
(MORE)

ORLEAN (contd)
Im alive in a profound world now It
sizzles with beauty and horror and sex
Now writing is -- words are -- a way to
remove yourself from passion So Im
done with writing John and I are making
a fortune with this extract Its big in
the Miami club scene We call it
Passion
(giggles)
Isnt that cute

Up ahead Laroche turns off the road at the Fakahatchee sign

ORLEAN (contd)
Follow him please

EXT JANES SCENIC DRIVE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Laroche parks Kaufman parks behind him Orlean gestures

with her gun for him to get out As Kaufman comes around the
car he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat Laroche
emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over
his shoulder Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him Kaufman
shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high
water They slog through silently Laroche stops

LAROCHE

This spot looks good

(thinking aloud)
Now how do we do this Hit him in the
head with a rock first Keeping in mind
we can only hit him once and only with as
much force as would be created by him
slipping and falling onto the rock

Laroche paces Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock
She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out

of it Kaufman shivers Orleans drugs kick in

ORLEAN
Holy Jesus Holy Hey baby hey

Orlean trails off Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean
LAROCHE
Should we drown him then hit him on the
head Uh-uh A body bleeds different if
the hearts stopped These new forensic
guys are very smart We really have to
know our corpses to stand a chance rigor
mortis lividity putrefecation ocular
changes

(MORE)

LAROCHE (contd)
Maybe you think we hit him on the head
and force water into his lungs after hes
dead No darlin Theyll know he
didnt drown See contrary to popular
belief the lungs do not -- do not --
fill with water in a drowning What
happens is choking causes an irritation
of the mucous membranes This creates a
shitload of mucus in the windpipe
Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a
sticky foam which may or may not mix with
vomit Its the presence of this white
foam that indicates drowning Theres a
lot to be aware of Susie Shoeprints
hair microscopic fibers Tire tracks
They all tell a tale to todays forensic
scientists
(to Kaufman)
What do you think Youre a writer How
would you do it Whats a good way to
kill somebody

KAUFMAN
I dont write this kind of bullshit

LAROCHE
Dont get all huffy I was simply --

Suddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back flies forward into
the water Orlean looks up spaced Shes confused by a
second Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil
Donald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road

Laroche pulls himself from the water

LAROCHE (contd)
Fuck

ORLEAN
(receptively)
Yeah lets baby

She staggers moonily toward Laroche He pushes her away

LAROCHE
Not now We got to kill that guy And
now I guess that other guy as well

ORLEAN
(disappointed)
Ohhh

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS
Kaufman and Donald speed along the swamp road

KAUFMAN
For Christs sake why didnt you do
something while we were in the car

DONALD
My back had seized I couldnt move

Laroches van pulls close to them and rams them from behind

KAUFMAN
Shit

It rams them again this time sending them down into the
swamp The van stops Donald tries to back the car onto the
road the wheels just spin Laroche steps out of the van

DONALD
Weve gotta ditch this thing

KAUFMAN
(hysterical)
Its a rental Its a rental

DONALD
Now

Kaufman and Donald climb from the car make their way deep
into the swamp Laroche follows them in on foot dragging
Orlean who is admiring all the plant life

ORLEAN
Thats beautiful Whats that Johnny

LAROCHE
Asclepias lanceolata Red milkweed

Laroche shoots at the brothers Kaufman whines

LAROCHE
(to Orlean)

ORLEAN
Um yknow Charlie or something

LAROCHE
Charlie Listen lets talk This pie

(to Orlean)
Why are there two of him

Orlean shrugs
ORLEAN
Identical twigs
(laughs crazily)

Did I say twigs I meant twins

Kaufman and Donald run through a colony of sawgrass

slices them like razor blades Kaufman yells in pain

oozes through their shirts and pants

LAROCHE
Cladium jamaicense guys Sawgrass You

evil shit Cut you up

KAUFMAN
Fuck you Laroche

LAROCHE

pitfalls I know these swamps forwards
and backwards Theres alligators and
poisonous snakes fellas Wild hogs

It
Blood

Kaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water
Nowhere to go Laroche and Orlean close in The brothers

run along the periphery of the lake Donald stops
DONALD
Wait Do you hear something

Kaufman stops hears a distant galloping and squealing

KAUFMAN
Donald that sounds bad

The brothers run in the opposite direction The galloping
gets louder Its wild pigs Donald spots an airboat on the
shore They jump onto it search hysterically in the dark
for bow to start it The pigs get closer Laroche and
Orlean get closer Donald finds a button presses it the
engine starts They pull away from the shore just as the
pigs catch up One pig leaps on board squealing Kaufman
kicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat A kick
connects and the pig flies into the water

Laroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle It
nicks the boat Donald looks back and the boat heads for a
cypress stand

KAUFMAN
Watch out watch out watch out

Donald gets the boat back on course Laroche and Orlean have
been left far behind Donald slows the boat

DONALD
I think were okay

Suddenly Laroches van comes tearing around a corner and
speeds along the road at the waters edge Orlean shoots at
the boat from the van window

DONALD (contd)
Hold on

Donald speeds up The van keeps up the shooting continues
Bullets whiz Kaufman puts his head in his hands A bullet
hits the airboats gas tank It explodes in a ball of flame
illuminating the whole swamp Kaufman and Donald are thrown
along with flaming pieces of debris Donald treads water
looks all around for Kaufman

DONALD (contd)
Charles Charles Where are you

Underwater A dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings The
murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the
surface An alligator appears Kaufman panics surfaces

On the surface Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water
then get jerked back down Donald dives

Underwater The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the
leg Donald surfaces comes back down with a broken
propeller blade He hacks the alligators head off grabs
Kaufman and brings him to the surface

Donald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow Another shot is
fired It skims the water near Kaufman

KAUFMAN
Fuck Fuck Donald were dead

DONALD
Were okay Hows your leg

KAUFMAN
I dont know Hows your back

DONALD
Its fine My back is fine

Laroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van shooting

Mike Owen in pajamas leaves his house jumps in his truck
and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames

Donald makes it to shore He climbs out and is helping
Kaufman when he gets hit by a bullet and falls

KAUFMAN
Donald

Kaufman sloshes to shore His right leg is bloody and
mangled He lifts his brothers head onto his lap

KAUFMAN
Youre gonna be okay

DONALD

No But dont let them get you too
(weak smile)

You got a fucking awesome third act

KAUFMAN
(crying)
Donald this is an awful bizarre thing
to say and an awful time to say it but
Im sorry I didnt get to know you
better Im so sorry Im so sorry

DONALD
Its really Youve been really nice

KAUFMAN
See its just I thought I knew you
already I thought you were me And I
hated me

Donald touches Kaufmans face Kaufman looks at his brother
Donalds face glows radiantly in the fire light

DONALD
Well dont do that anymore Okay

KAUFMAN
Okay

Donald dies Kaufman screams heavenward The van appears

out of the bush barreling for them Kaufman rolls his
brother out of the way and limps off into a slough The van
follows smashes into a tree and comes to a halt

Smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights
of the smoke Laroche and Orlean appear with guns They
follow Kaufman into the swamp

Mike Owen pulls next to the disabled van He gets out
surveys the mess sees bloody Donald on the ground

MIKE OWEN
Jesus that writer guy

Owen grabs his CB tries to radio for help Its broken
He lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off

Kaufman limps through the dark water Laroche and Orlean
follow the sound of his sloshing

ORLEAN
Water sounds so sparkly Like lemon
plastic jewels plopping onto a silver
trampoline Dontcha think

LAROCHE
Darlin please

Out
ORLEAN
Can we fuck now baby Fuck like lemons

Owen tears along the dirt road Up ahead Kaufman limps out
of the swamp into the trucks headlights Owen is confused
He checks the back to see if Donalds body is still there and
skids off the road into the swamp Kaufman hurriedly limps
over to the disabled truck Owen climbs out

KAUFMAN
You gotta help me You gotta help me

MIKE OWEN
What the hell is going on here

KAUFMAN
Theyre after me Theyve got guns
They killed my brother

MIKE OWEN
Whos got guns What are you --

Before Owen finishes his truck is flipped over Donalds
body flies into the water There staring Kaufman and Owen

down is a giant man-like beast Its repulsive covered in
algae-matted fur

MIKE OWEN (contd)
Holy shit

The two men turn and run

MIKE OWEN (contd)
Its real I cant believe it I never --

The creature grabs Owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick
Kaufman screams as he runs watches over his shoulder He
runs right into the arms of Orlean

ORLEAN
Hey its the screenwriter

KAUFMAN
Theres a thing back there You dont
want to be here

Kaufman Orlean and Laroche look back Nothing there

LAROCHE

Orlean studies Laroches gun Her nose is practically
touching the barrel

ORLEAN

Laroche reaches for Orleans arm to pull her away Suddenly
the creature grabs Laroche pulls him into the swamp

LAROCHE (contd)
Susie Susie

Orlean looks around

ORLEAN

LAROCHE (0S)
Susie

Orlean agitated and disoriented fires repeatedly into the
darkness Something slumps forward in the water Orlean
steps cautiously over keeping her gun on Kaufman The
creature is dead so is Laroche

ORLEAN
(crying softly)
Oh Johnny
She sits next to Laroche and pets his head Kaufman watches

her The sun is coming up

KAUFMAN

thought you were smart and maybe lost and
lonely like me And the way you wrote
about Laroche You said he was handsome
even though he had no front teeth --
Kaufman ta

ORLEAN
Oh Johnny Johnnys teeth Oh

KAUFMAN

I figured you could look at me and see
something even with all my flaws you
could look at me and find something you
could maybe someday write a description
of me that would be nicer than the one I
write day in and day out in my head

(hopefully)
Would it be

kes Orleans chin in his hand and directs her gaze

to him She stares at him for a long while then

ORLEAN
Youre really so wonderful

KAUFMAN

ORLEAN
