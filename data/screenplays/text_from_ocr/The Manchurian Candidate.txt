Approximately sixty four hundred hours
before Desert Storm we were on a routine
recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain
assessing troop strength for what Saddam
Hussein promised to be the mother of all
wars but turned out to be just a
little warm up for the whomping he got a
few years later

PROWLING ACROSS undulating land dotted with BURNING OIL
WELLS that give the vague impression of well hell The
inky sky is awash with stars
ON THE CREST OF A DUNE

A US ARMY BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE and matching HUMMER
sit waiting

Muffled THUMP of rap music thrums from the Bradley and low
voices stray from the open doors of the Hummer

Why cant we go directly in
INTEXT THE HUMMER - NIGHT
A topographical MAP glows on the LCD screen of a laptop
portable faintly lighting the faces of CAPT BEN MARCO and
his big gentle French guide LAURENT TOKAR

MARCO

this way --

LAURENT

Yes well -- I see the Captain enjoys the
road less travelled
Marco is seemingly unflappable completely engaged by life

MARCO
The Captain enjoys not dragging his ass
down the highway for every Tom Dick and

Qadhafi to take a whack at
Laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach

Marco bug-like in night goggles drives the infamous
Highway of Death -- a macabre landscape of abandoned cars
trucks minivans shopping baskets broken wooden pushcarts

belongings are scattered out into the desert on either side
of the road Laurent rides shotgun Raymond is in the

RAYMOND

Why dont I ever ride in the Bradley with
the other enlisted personnel

81803

MARCO

(hesitates)
Maybe I enjoy your company Sergeant

RAYMOND

Sir I dont want to be singled out for
special treatment because of my mothers
position --

MARCO

Too late for that Shaw As a charter
member of the Lucky Sperm Club your
benefits include unlimited suck-up from
High-ranking Officers hoping to curry
Congressional favor for their future
career moves But If you want to ride
in the Bradley hey I got no objections

RAYMOND
(worried)
Trust me sir I dont wish to ride in
the Bradley with the others Im just

IN THE MIRROR - ON THE ROAD BEHIND THEM 11

Two dark trucks converge suddenly out of the darkness on
either side of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle --

They SLAM together in a pincer-wedge just in front of it
and the Bradley CRASHES into them -- climbs over them off-
balance and SMASHES DOWN onto the roof of one of the trucks
and is effectively low-bridged -- tracks spinning unable to
move -- DARK FIGURES scurry from the trucks

THE HUMMER -- skids around in a tight 180 stops facing 12

bursts bright and ricochet harmlessly away --

IN THE HUMMER -- MARCO scrambles up out of his seat pops
the roof hatch and screams at Raymond --

overturned trailer and FIRES

Grabs a dazed Bobby Baker by the collar --

MARCO

The Medal of Honor is the highest award
to which any soldier can aspire From
the jungles of Iwo Jima to the desert of
Kuwait what these brave men Ive talked
about today did will never be forgotten
Since 1917 only 827 medals have been
given to a total of more than 30 million
Americans in arms Only three have been
awarded in the last 40 years Who knows
Maybe someday one of you fine boys will
earn one yourself in defense of this
great nation

A SCOUTMASTER thin bearded stands up

SCOUTMASTER

Major Marco on behalf of Troops 484 and
488 -- just like to thank you for coming
to talk to us about the Medal of Honor
and your interesting experiences in the
Armed Services

claimed the Army as a trade ever since a
young gunnery officer who grew up with
Hernando De Soto left Spain for a look at

up I try to get it all -- it doesnt

SKETCHY PORTRAIT OF AN ARABIC WOMAN whose face is covered
with intricate designs -- Marco stares curiously as if he
recognizes her --

MELVIN

I cant get my hand around it I thought
maybe if you had the dreams

MARCO

You need money --

No No sir
Self-conscious (people are staring) Melvin shoves the

ELLIE

I asked downstairs and Miss Freeman your
wrangler -- helpful Ms Freeman -- said
you were up here practicing your speech
Honestly I dont understand why you
insist upon isolating yourself people
adore you Raymond they crave your
company and yet here you are holed up
as if you were some kind of emotionally
challenged individual like your father
instead of Raymond Prentiss Shaw a
handsome intelligent people-loving war
hero with a great deal to offer to his
party and his country

Now Ellie

No to all the questions you pretend to

Something a little less busy

RAYMOND

-- and no you may not engage in your
usual back-door political thuggery to
shovel me onto the presidential ticket

ELLIE

Oh Youre not interested I thought
you were Did I miss my cue

RAYMOND
Of course Im interested -- I wouldnt be
here if I wasnt -- but not if it means

attacking the reputation of a statesman
like Thomas Jordan which Im sure was
your plan Let democracy run its course
mother Let the people decide

Im sorry for a second there I thought
it was your father speaking -- that
dreaded Shaw blood rising -- and the
stink of defeat made me nauseous

And excuse me when have I ever attacked
the honorable Mr Jordan despite the
shameful way his daughter misled you that
summer at the shore

RAYMOND
Mother you chased her away --

ELLIE
If thats how you want to remember it

RAYMOND

-- you ruined everything

PUSH IN ON THE TELEVISION TIGHT - A RED SUPERTOMATO

now commands the screen plump and glistening in an olive-
skinned hand decorated with intricate henna tattoos --

WOMANS VOICE

-- transformed the common garden tomato
through genome-level intervention from
that fragile fickle vulnerable fruit
one must struggle to simply nurture to

maturity --
-- the supertomato slowly bisects itself -- opening oozing
viscous red liquid -- revealing an inner structure far more

suggestive of the human brain than any tomato weve ever
seen before

WOMANS VOICE

-- into a resilient dependable
categorically superior individual in
every conceivable way --

-- moving through

MARCOS DREAMSCAPE -- where the MYSTERIOUS ARABIC WOMAN from
Melvins drawings -- henna tattoos on her face as well as
her hands -- thick blood-red pulp of the supertomato
dripping between her fingers -- glides dreamily across

intricate sun-bleached tile work through a gathering of
similarly clothed Arabic WOMEN A few OLDER ARABIC MEN are
off to one side expressionless hands in pockets

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN

-- strappingly resistant to parasite

disease over-ripening and systemic

failure -- while at the same time

fiercely heat and water tolerant --
IMPRESSIONS of soldiers -- MEMBERS of Marcos squad -- flak
jackets and BDUs rifles at ease some squatting some
leaning against the wall Cpl Al Melvin preternaturally
engrossed in the presentation
We hear a SANDSTORM raging outside causing LONG DRAPERIES
to FLUTTER and POP like sails STRONG IMPRESSIONS of
PFCs ED MAVOLE and BOBBY BAKER

MYSTERIOUS WOMAN

frontal lobe -- nevertheless retaining a

sweet juicy plumpness reminiscent of the

finest English Beefsteak or Italian Plum
IMPRESSIONS of the American Flag IMPRESSIONS of SGT

obedient schoolboy dutifully holding his SERVICE REVOLVER
in his hand

wearing hospital greens WIRES AND TUBES are rigged to his

thicker cables and tubes beneath which robotic BRACKET ARMS
adjust whirring softly with his every movement hes
drugged to the gills jerking with spasms as low voltage

electricity courses through his brain

Yes Brilliant But there were
casualties

MARCO

There are always casualties maam
the DREAM SOUNDS (wind fabric women chanting) emanate
from audio speakers the sandstorms wind caused by huge
moveable FANS
IMPRESSION of an OLD MAN shaking a percussive gourd

ordered up half a million and stuck
about five thousand experimentally into

under it

The tragic deaths of the incumbent vice

president and his Senator mother mark the

end of a family dynasty that has

dominated American politics for more than
fifty years The mother and the son

polar opposites on myriad issues

nevertheless managed to promise a one

many Americans the hopeful heady notion

that these two somehow comprised a united
vision of stunning almost revolutionary

potential far greater than its parts

village on an empty beach -- we remember it vividly from
Marcos memory -- arriving to slowly SPIN and hover over the

MARCO

You dont develop a technology like that

and waste it on two guys
He looks to Rosie who stands in an archway There are
SOLDIERS here with weapons -- could be here to guard Marco
Could be here to protect him

ROSIE

We know that
Marco looks past her to the water which stretches out from
here as if to forever

MARCO

I remember running
His arm is in a simple sling He moves like a man whos
been shot and not quite recovered -- moves past Rosie out
of the broken-down ruins

MARCO

I had to get out where the sky was
Rosie motions the soldiers to stay back follows him by
herself

MARCO

I had to get to the water
PULL BACK as they walk down the beach to the sea A few
tumble-down buildings are all that remains of an ancient
seaside town

MARCO

I thought if I can just get to the
water everything will be okay
Marco approaches the waters edge staring out at the
uncertain horizon
Nothing but water as far as the eye can see
PULL BACK And back And back

FADE OUT
