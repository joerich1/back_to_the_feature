DARKNESS WIND
Dry
Relentless

FADE IN
EXT THE WASTELAND — DAWN

The Darkness becomes a shifting veil of sand and we are inside
the funnel of a dust storm The veil parts momentarily revealing
a vista of dunes a thin poisonous wind shipping across them in a
crimson spray Then the veil closes again shifting to reveal a
new tableau

Abstract shapes silhoutted against a red sky

A steel fence post

A coil of barbed wire

A body its outline softened by the dust broken and half-buried
its ragged uniform fluttering in a mockery of life

A glint of dusty metal

A minefield laid bare by the restless wind

Another shape gains resolution in the dust

A steel hand appears jointed fingers pointed skyward veins an
intricate web of cables and hydraulic tubing born of fire

A seething dust cloud appears low on the horizon a dark shape
emerging from its swirling grain fluttering for a moment like a
grounded bat drawing closer becoming the figure of a NOMAD
swathed in a flapping scarf and a ragged duster face shadowed by
a wide-brimmed hat shoulders hunched beneath the weight of a
bulging military backpack He holds a long stick like a spear in
one hand and as he approaches we see the sunlight glistening on
his tinted blast goggles and on the transparent respirator that
protects his face

The nomad is moving hurriedly trying to keep ahead of the storm
his eyes nervously scanning the horizon

There is a sharp crack and two flares drift down behind him like
will-o’-the-wisps falling from the red sky

He glances around and his eyes catch a glint of metal through the
gloom

Slowing he weaves his way across the minefield feeling out a
path with the tip of his stick his eyes focused on a shape
buried beneath a low ridge of sand

He sees the reaching synthetic hand and hunches beside it
sweeping away the dust the wind helping him and slowly a face
emerges from the earth
A steel face with eyes like red jewels features scorched and
marked by shrapnel woundsThe nomad begins to dig more swiftly
now

He glances furtively around and then looks down smiling at his
discovery

The steel skull could be smiling back at him

DISSOLVE TO
INT JILLS APARTMENT — DAWN

A landscape of metal sculpture Crash helmets and motorcycle
fenders blend into the screaming faces of grotesquely customized
domestic androids reaching waldo arms and webs of barbed wire
and rubber tubing filling every square inch of the bedroom
bathroom kitchen and connecting hallway

A digital clock radio on the stereo system flicks to 600 AM
and HEAVY METAL comes crashing forth from the radio

INT KITCHEN

An automatic coffee maker simultaneously begins to BURBLE and
spills a spattering stream of soy-cafe into a glass tureen

INT APARTMENT

The sole occupant of the apartment is already awake A figure is
crouched in the midst of the tangle of sculptures surrounded by
numerous pencil sketches of insects face hidden by a battered
welding mask body swathed in paint-spattered overalls the
nozzle of an oxy-acetylene torch held in gloved hands sparks
showering everywhere

The door buzzer rings a long held BUZZZZZZZZ The metal worker
curses turns off the gas and crosses to a computer control
console in the lounge On the way she turns down the music to a
dull throb

She props up her welding mask and types a series of digits into
the computer Her face is prematurely careworn but attractive
Shes in her late twenties her hair hanging in strands her face
slick with sweat Her name is JILL

A screen blinks into life on the console patching into a
security camera that is trained outside the apartment door
Theres no one there

She bites her lower lip and taps a few more keys and gets a view
down the hall and then a view from the other direction No one
there She exhales in frustration and types
After a few seconds of electronic snow the face of a blonde kid
appears in a haze Hes got a bandanna wrapped around his
forehead and a wad of gum in his teeth This is VERNON

VERNON
Yo

JILL
Vernon is the Chief there

VERNON
Hi Miss Monroe No hes out on his rounds
right now I can have him call ya

JILL
Those kids from two were at my door again

VERNON
When was this

JILL
Just now

VERNON
We didnt see anybody

JILL
Thats what worries me

VERNON
Huh

JILL
Listen Vernon Ive got a delivery coming from
Foodstuffs today Be sure to let ‘em up

VERNON
Will do Miss Monroe

The screen blinks off Jill mutters

JILL
Probably the only one who wont make it through
his net”

She walks to the kitchen pours a cup of coffee comes back out
turns the MUSIC BACK UP flips down her visor and goes back to
work
CAMERA MOVES PAST HER TO the window looking out on the city -- a
large urban metropolis somewhere in the future Mile high
chimneys rise against the smog-filled morning sky

EXT SCRAPYARD — DAY

MUSIC OVER A scrapvard on the outskirts of the city The remains
of cars and mangled ward machines lie in corroding mounds and
oily clouds streaked with sparks billow from the mouths of forges
and furnace stacks

Shadowy FIGURES move through the smoke welding irons glowing
in their hands unloading untidy barrows of scrap onto clattering
conveyor belts

The air is thick with the THUNDER of heavy machinery the
distorted CRIES of men and the CRACKLE of radio static

The VOICE of a DEEJAY comes over the airwaves

ANGRY BOB
This is Angry Bob coming at you on WAR Radio
with the good news and the bad news Bad news
is the heatwaves not going to let up Its
expected to hit ninety downtown before
nightfall although weather control keeps
promising that rain is on the way The foul up
on the launch pad at terminal eight doesnt
look like its gonna clear for another half
hour and holiday air traffic is still stacking
up over the CBD and all outlying districts But
traffic control promises that if you all keep
cool theyll get you home in time for

Christmas As for the good news -- I forget
what the good news was so lets just play some
music

The deejay LAUGHS his voice echoing maniacally as METAL crashes
across the wavelengths spilling out into the scrapyard from an
old transistor radio thats been left standing on the hood of a
wrecked car

MO BAXTER and his friend SHADES are traversing the yard MO is
still young his muscular build betraying long hours of obsessive
bench pressing His blond hair is close-cropped and he wears
patched and fazed military uniform his shirt unbuttoned to
reveal a vest that is hand-painted with a blazing skull A jagged
scar zig-zags across his left cheek and his left hand is missing
altogether replaced by a robot prosthesis A large grey duffle
is thrown over his shoulder Shades is a scrawny individual
wearing a leather flying jacket and a three-day growth of beard
He squints through the dark lenses of his trademark glasses
Shades is talking his usual blue streak Mo has on a tolerant
half-smile

SHADES
New York Max Thats the place to make it
now Just think of it Over nine thousand tons
of steel

SHADES (Contd)
Five thousand tons of aluminum Four million
miles of copper wire Twelve thousand windows
Tons of audio gear Auto parts Typewriters
Kitchen appliances Works of art still in the
galleries Just hanging there Clothing
Toupees Bridgework False teeth Prosthetic
limbs You name it Theres a killing to be
made New York has it all Nobodys gonna
repopulate the Big Apple now Its too ripe
with radiation The counts way up All that
stuffs just going begging Its salvage city
Max Youd love it

MO
Stop calling me Max

SHADES
Why not Its a good name Anyway give New
York some thought Its a lot safer than the
zone and the move would do you good

MO
I cant afford the outlay Youd need rad
suits jeeps drilling gear Im saving up to

retire in peace
SHADES
Retire to what
Mo gives a nod to the overalled workers as he and Shades head up
to the dilapidated warehouse at the center of the yard
INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE - DAY
Mo and Shades step through the sliding doors into a large hall

It’s wide as an aircraft hanger lit by hanging flourescent tube
and dusty skylights
The remains of gutted electronic equipment and dismembered
androids are stacked everywhere mechanical limbs and hydraulic
tubing dangling from the rafters giving the place the appearance
of a cannibals den ALVY a dwarf clad in threadbare grease-
covered overeralls and holding a spanner in one hand is hunched
over the shivering partly-animated torso of a malfunctioning
domestic bot He looks up from his work at the approaching pair
and grins

ALVY
Well well well Taking a little vacation
huh Is this authorized

Mo slips the bag of his shoulder It hits the floor with a
shifting CLANK

MO
What do you care Nothing that comes in here is
authorized

ALVY
Thats not true I’m primarily legitimate now
Ill have you know

MO
Oh

Mo lifts the bag off the floor with one hand

MO
Perhaps I should go elsewhere then

ALVY
I said primarily legitimate

He shoves the quivering android off the table into a rolling
tamper He brushes wood and metal filings from the table-top with
his sleeve

ALVY
Put it right here and lets see what youve
got Let me get my glass

Alvy hops down from the bench and scurries into the nether
reaches of the warehouse Mo hefts the bag onto the bench Unzips
it

Behind them the warehouse doors open with a tremulant RUMBLE Mo
and Shades turn around A figure is silhouetted against the
blazing daylight Its the nomad Coming toward them He tips his
hat up to look at them Speaks in a low voice
NOMAD
Where’s the little man

Mo steps forward just a trifle hesitantly Taking charge

MO
He’s indisposed You got something to sell

The nomad tips his head foreward Eyes Mo awhile Then what
the hell He nods Unloads his sack on the table Steel skull
dismembered metal arms a limbless torso — tubing spilling from
the guts -- and several spidery subsidiary arms terminating in
pincers and drill bits

SHADES
What the fuck

Shades picks up the skull awestruck The nomad delicately takes
it from him and replaces it

MO
What is it

The nomad slowly shakes his head

MO
Whered you find it

The nomad moves his head slightly to indicate a distant world

NOMAD
Nowheresville

Mo and Shades nod They know what he means

NOMAD
Looks like it stepped on a frag mine No legs
at all and the torso is all fucked up
MO
(quickly)

What do you want for it
Shades looks at him shocked

NOMAD
Fifty

Now Shades looks at him
MO
Too much Thirty

NOMAD
(no nonsense)
Fifty
MO
Forty
The nomad nods
NOMAD
Done
MO
(to Shades)

Pay the man

A stunned Shades peels off bills as Mo stuffs the robot parts
into his own bag of the floor The nomad turns and heads out

MO
That was easy

Mo hefts the bag onto the table Alvy returns just as the figure
of the departing nomad is eaten up by the blazing sunlight Alvy
squints after him

ALVY
Who was that

MO
Somebody looking for a bathroom I sent him on
his way

ALVY

Why doesnt he piss in the street like
everybody else

Alvy clambers up onto the bench rubbing his hands together He
plucks a large magnifying glass from his back pocket

ALVY
Now what have you got for me

Mo unzips the bag and turns it over Metal THUNDERS out Alvy
leans over the pile of parts His eyes widen almost
imperperceptibly at the sight of the skull A pulse of
excitement He glances at the otheres to make sure they didnt
notice Then he shrugs indifferently

Shades picks up the skull again Now he can peruse it in earnest
Alvy’s eyes can’t help but to follow it He tries to keep his

voice casual

ALVY
Whered you get that

Mo glances at Shades

MO
I found it out in the zone What do you think
it is
ALVY
(shrugging)

Maintenance drone probably
Mo furrows his brow doubtfully

MO
You think so

SHADES
Kinda scary-looking for a maintenance drone

ALVY
Thats the idea Keeps the scavengers away
Ysee you got a downed vehicle somewhere in
the middle of nowhere no survivors you can
drop a couple of these and have it put back
together in no time

Shades looks the skull in the eye

SHADES
Nobody around to put him back together though
huh

MO

It doesnt have any legs at all that I could
find and the torsos all fucked up Stepped on
a frag mine I guess Musta got lost

Shades grins slyly at him

SHADES
You figure
Mo narrows his eyes briefly at him Alvy plucks the skull from
his hands Shades frowns Alvy shines a light in the androids
eyes
ALVY

Not much I can do with this I can use the

infra-reds Breadboard up a couple of new

circuits

(shrugging)
How about thirty Cs to take it off your hands

MO
Thirty
(shaking his head)
No thanks Alvy Maybe Ill just hold onto
it

Mo takes the skull and sticks it back into the bag An alarm off
behind Alvys eyes

ALVY
Hold onto it What--- Forty Cs

Mo eyes him Half-smiling

MO
I thought it was worthless

ALVY
It is It is worthless But its even more
worthless to you

MO
Jeez you werent trying to low-ball me were
you Alvy You wouldnt cheat me

Alvy shakes his head watching the pieces disappear into the
sack

ALVY
No I wouldnt cheat you but but It is
junk butwhat are you gonna do with it

MO
Its Christmas Eve You should know that You
used to be an elf didnt you I cant exactly
come back to my girl empty-handed can I

ALVY
Wouldnt she rather have a nice bouquet of
flowers maybe Theyve got some beautiful
stuff at the Mart Just like in the pictures
Smell real good too Even die on you after a
couple of days Very convincing Shed love
em

MO
You dont know my girl

SHADES
Jill doesn’t have any use for fake flowers Not
when she can have real metal

Mo nods at the pile of remaining parts

MO
How much for the other stuff

Alvy shakes his head lips twisted in a tight bitter frown He
desultorily lifts a couple pieces Then he notices a severed
steel hand on the bottom of the pile One Mo missed Alvy quickly
drops the other pieces over it Opens his hands to Mo

ALVY
Ten Cs Thats as high as I go

Mo holds out his hand for it Alvy quickly counts out several
bills from a greasy roll

MO
Yep Alvy Youre as high as youre ever going
to go

Mo hands the bills to Shades and they head for the door Alvy
sneers after them

ALVY
Very funny Can i help it if my mother picked
up a dose in the big one
(calling after)
You just wait All those years out in the zone
Your kids1l make me look like Narcissus

EXT STREET — DAY

The temperature is still rising and heat shimmers in the sealed
tar and concrete valley of the street Mo and Shades dismount
from a pedi-cab and move through the CROWD dodging the crawling
man-powered vehicles Knots of figures sit clustered like
barnacles in the shade of each supporting pillar of the elevated
roadway their legs almost under the wheels of the traffic There
is a low RUMBLE as a truck passes on an overhead expressway
Mo and Shades pass a row of rusting wheelles cars smoke rising
from the chimneys in their roofs Several TEENAGERS are busy
beating up a WINO they’ve got pinned against one of the hoods
The wino breaks free and comes stumbling across Mo’s path He
falls to one knee grasping at Mo’s leg begging inarticulately
for help The kids LAUGH

Mo looks menacingly at them his hand falling to the butt of his
shotgun The kids clam up Mo holds their sullen gaze He draws
the gun from its holster The kids finally retreat down an alley
The wino murmurs his garbled thanks pawing at Mos leg

MO
Hey Youre creasing the pants

Mo pushes him away with the gun-barrel The wino tumbles hard Mo
walks on deftly slipping the shotgun back into its harness
Shades hurries to keep with him

SHADES
Tough guy

MO
Shut up

SHADES

Thats why youre still in the corps isnt it
Mo gives him a look Fed up

MO
Why

SHADES
You tell me

Mo rolls his eyes

SHADES
No really Tell me why

MO
(mock breezily)
The moneys good I get around I see whats
left of the world

SHADES
I get around too and at least Im still in
one piece
MO
Yeah until one of your boosters blows up under
you or your heatshield rips off on the way
home

SHADES
Dont knock it At least it’s quick One pssht
and youre gas spread out over a thousand miles
of stratosphere Think of the view No coughing
your lungs out in a bunker or sitting around
waiting for the first cancer cells to show up
or your kids to be born blind and blue because
youve had one dose too many and come up snake
eyes in the genetic crap game you play every
time you go zone tripping DO you think Jill
wants you to go on strolling around out there
up to your ass in radioactive iodine for the
rest of your life

MO
Think shed like it better if I was on welfare
Wound up like these bums Nothing else I can
do Not now Anyway I dont want kids Cant
stand the little motherfuckers

INT APARTMENT BLOCK FOYER - DAY

Mo steps through the twisted remains of a security gate into the
graffiti-scarred foyer

MO
What the fuck happened here

SHADES
Some hophead drove a land cruiser through it
Put Tommy in the hospital Did you know him

MO
When did this happen

SHADES
Two three months ago
(beat)
Right after - you left

Mo pauses at a batteted computer terminal and types in an access
code before turning to face the steel doors of the lift The
doors are slightly buckled as if someone has tried to open them
with a crowbar A grating metallic WHINE comes inside the
elevator shaft Mo waits for a while listening as the whine
drops to a lower pitch and then cuts out entirely He rattles the
door in frustration

CHIEF
Another scorcher today Nearly ninety they
said on the news

MO
And they take the temperature on the roof Down
in the streets its a damn sight hotter

CHIEF
That it is Hey while youre here I want you
to meet someone Got a new kid on the job
Vernon say hello to Mister Baxter
(to Mo)
You heard about Tommy

Shades nods Up above Vernon sticks his head through the
railings and grins down at them Hes working on a wad of gum

VERNON
Yo

Mo raises his hand to say hello but Vernon has ducked back out
of sight

CHIEF
Kids got shit for brains but hell work out
once he knows the ropes It aint brain
surgery

Mo nods down to the lower floors

MO
Looks like this is the last line of defense

CHIEF
Damn right This is as far as they get Weve
got new surveillance gear all over the block
If you want to maybe pop down later for a game
Ill show you ‘how it works

MO
Maybe I1ll do that

CHIEF
Id appreciate it Havent had a good game in weeks
Vernons got no head for chess You can imagine

Mo and Shades press on up the staircase Shades wants to put a
question to Mo Finally gets up the nerve
SHADES
She know youre back

MO
(shaking his head)
I didnt want to wake her
SHADES
You didnt mind waking me

MO
You I dont care about

Shades shakes his head

SHADES
You shoulda called Think shell let you stay

MO
(blustery )
Course she will She sleeps better when Im
around Makes her feel more secure

SHADES
Ha Thats a laugh She couldnt be more secure
than she is now Shes sealed in tight She
doesnt need you or me

MO
Is that right

SHADES
She doesnt stick her little toe out of there
if she doesnt have to

MO
How do you know

Shades shrugs uneasily

SHADES
I keep an eye on her

Mo stops turns back Eyes him narrowly Shades shrugs again
a little embarrassed Mo finally smiles

MO
Good Keep it up
(nodding)
When Im not around See nothing happens to
her okay Promise me that
Mo is surprisingly serious Shades nods

SHADES
Sure Ill do what I can Sure
(then)
You going somewhere
Mo turns and climbs to the top of the stairs He stands outside
the steel door of an apartment He reaches for the buzzer

INT APARTMENT

BUZZZZZZZZ CAMERA PULLING AWAY FROM the other side of the door
DOWN the hallway to the console in the lounge Sulphourous light
from the oxy-acetylene torch flashes on the walls and console
The door again BUZZZZZZ2Z2Z2Z22222222

JILL (0S)
Goddamn it

The torch light cuts out

Jill steps to the console pulling off the welding mask tossing
it aside She rapidly types digits into the computer

The screen blinks to life and Mos face stares back at her
through the electronic blizzard For a moment she is silent her
features unreadable Mo smiles and she finds herself smiling
too almost against her will

JILL
Mo

His voice comes over the intercom thick with static

MO
You gonna let me in or what

EXT STAIRWELL
Mo waits for the door to open He shifts from foot to foot

MO
Jill You there

Shades nods seriously at him Shes there Mo clears his throat
Looks at the keypad next to the door Types a set of numbers
Nothing happens

JILL
(over intercom)
I changed the code
Mo exhales impatiently

MO
Jill Let me in

SHADES
(whispering)
Ill make up the couch

INT APARTMENT

Jill stands there eyes downcast Torn Finally shaking her head
in self-reproach and tapping a key She heads toward the hall

There is a HISS as the apartments hydraulics go into action and
the front door slides open on steel runners to reveal Mo and
Shades standing on the threshold Jill takes a geiger counter
hanging from its peg in the hall and runs it over them

JILL
Hmm Cessium levels low today

MO
Ive had warmer hellos

JILL
Hello Mo

He gives her a smile

MO
Hey there Jill

They’re a bit awkward Nobody makes the first move Jill nods at

Shades
JILL

SHADES
How’s it going

JILL
Not bad I-—-

Mo takes the opportunity to move past her down the hall Jill
hesitates for a second Then

JILL
-- I got a commision customizing consoles for
some uptowners Welfare checks are coming in
regular I cant complain

Mo stands on the edge of the living room He smiles lightly at
the chaos and puts down his gear Jill and Shades come in behind
him

JILL
See my new pet Ive been using it as a model
This morning I woke up and -- look -- it made a

web

Mo bends beside a glass tank His eyes focus on the spider and he
nods his head

SHADES
What do you feed it

JILL
Ive been giving it little bits of soy mince but
sometimes I catch a bug It sucks em dry

Mo frowns a little then reaches down into his gunny sack

MO
Ive got something else youll like

He starts to open the sack but then he sees that Jill isn’t
watching him

JILL
(to Shades)
Ive been basing my work more on organic
forms translating them into the
syntheticfocusing more on the synthesis

Shades nods Mo stands up suddenly

MO
(to Shades)
Listen you wanna stay for a beer or
something

SHADES
No thats okay thanks I want to talk to the
super about the air conditioning before we all
fry

JILL
They say theres a cold front on the way It
might cool things down in time for Christmas

SHADES
Yeah Theres hope yet

MO
Can you guys hold off on the weather report for
a minute

They look at him slightly surprised He opens his bag emptying
it onto the floor with a CLATTER The steel skull grins up at
them upside down amidst a tangle of components

MO
See anything you like

Jill kneels amidst the scrap her face lighting up

JILL
Oh Jesus God Hes beautiful
(lifting the skull)
I love it What a monster

She plants a kiss on its forehead
MO
(shrugging)
Maintenance drone if you can believe Alvy
He glances at Shades who shrugs back Jill sets down the skull
and lifts a severed mechanical arm running her fingers over the
metalwork Then she looks up at Mo and her face lights up with a

smile Mo gives it back

MO
Merry Christmas baby

She stands and hugs him still holding the androids arm in one
hand

Shades gives a little wave and backs toward the door

SHADES
I’m gonna head out You guys

Theyre still locked in embrace

JILL
Bye
MO
Later Shades

Shades gives a little ironic salute taps a number on the keypad
next to the door The door SHUNTS open He ducks out The door
HISSES shut

Jill and Mo kiss Deeply Holding each other tight

The steel skull lies where Jill left it still smiling the
embracing lovers inverted reflected in the depth of its glass
eyes

INT SHOWER - NIGHT

Hot water HISSES from the overhead faucet and Mo stands in the
frosted glass cubicle eyes closed steam rising around him as he
lets the shower wash away three months of sweat and engine oil
He reaches out pulling Jill closer Her hands reach around him
gently massaging her back feeling a web of waxy scar tissue
beneath her fingertips

A living mosaic of tattoos writhes beneath her touch a jungle
tangle of howling wolves wilting roses phallic warheads and
naked bodies Their lips meet and he caresses her and even though
he cannot feel the caress through his synthetic hand he feels her
shiver anyway She clasps his wrist raising the prosthetic limb
to her lips kissing the steep fingertips

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Later they lie in the circular bed in the room that serves as
both bedroom and lounge facing out towards the Venetian blinds
whose open slats reveal a panoramic vista of rooftops and glowing
windows The television set is on tuned to some program about
the famine the volume turned down the news camera tracking
silently across rows of emaciated bodies stacked like firewood
the images spilling their cold blue light across the naked
lovers The only sound in the apartment now is the rasping of
their breath the low hum of the air conditioning and the distant
throb of the city pulsing like blood rushing in their ears
muted by the soundproof walls

Jill cries out voice shrill as a bird call head thrown back
Mos hands clutching at her shoulders his eyes closed straining
toward transcendence Her cries become thicker distorted
becoming an electronic synthesis of sound as a red glow grows
around them and their image loses resolution their bodies
becoming solarized becoming a grainy pornographic photograph
taken on heat sensitive film stock
INT APARTMENT IN ADJACENT TOWER BLOCK — NIGHT

LINCOLN WEINBERG JR a short stocky man with close-cropped
hair wearing a gaudy Hawaiian shirt presses the remote lead-on
his camera keeping one eye pressed to the viewfinder The
shutter opens with a CLICK exposing another frame and then the
auto-wind mechanism WHIRS into action

A trickle of sweat runs down his forehead
LINCOLN
Yeah take it Take that big dick Take it all
bitch

He re-adjusts the infrared lens of his camera to maximum
telephoto panning slightly to keep Jill in the center of the
frame peering through the parallel bars of the blinds studying
the cascade of her hair the curve of her breasts

His hand eases itself into his lap his finger jerking on the
remote trigger almost a reflex action now He sees Mos hands
claw at her back hard enough to bruise and he groans Jill
shudders her spine arching and Lincoln shudders with her

He blinks trying to keep her moonlit image in focus

LINCOLN
God I love you

DISSOLVE TO
INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jill lies on her back amidst the stained sheets smoking a joint
letting Mo trace the outline of her body with his good hand She

smiles dreamily her eyes half-closed

JILL
Its good to have you here Moses

MO
Its good to be here

Then he sighs quietly drawing his hand away lying back He
stares at the ceiling

JILL
What is it

MO
What are we gonna do

JILL
About what
She’s a bit wary now Cool

MO
About us
(pause)
Do you ever think about that

JILL
(deadpan)
I like it when were together I havent
thought much beyond that Youre not somebody I
can rely on
(suddenly )
How long are you going to stay this time

Hes silent for a long while She waits Finally with
difficulty

MO
Im AWOL I have to be back by next Thursday or
Ill be counted out

She sits up Angry

JILL
Let them count you out You dont owe them
anything

She glances at his robot hand He curls it up moves it away
MO
No They owe me six months of back pay I wont
get it unless I stick it out until my contract

is up

Jill is frustrated Draws up her knees Rests her temple against
them turned away from him Quietly

JILL
Which is when

He’s evasive Shrugs

MO
Few months

She slowly stretches out again Lying with her back to him Is
trying to say something
MO
(softly)
The thing is IJill
(pause)
I really love you

Long pause Her expression doesnt change

JILL
So
He closes his eyes Sleepy Dreamy He shrugs languidly

MO
Maybe we

He trails off She lies there watching the neon flicker of light
play in the Venetian blinds and listening to the throb and whir
of the city Then she hears distant music come drifting up from
the depth of the glass canyon outside the window pane faint
almost lost beneath the roar of the traffic A choir singing A
Christmas carol

Silent Night Holy Night

Jill turns to Mo and touches his arm

JILL
Mo

But it is already too late He is fast asleep She sighs curling
up beside him listening to the distant carol as she too drifts
slowly into sleep

All is calm

All is bright

DISSOLVE THROUGH
NOWHERE

A shifting veil of fire

Wind borne sparks

A great wind blowing

Sand lifting from the dunes in crimson sheets twisting in the
air taking on the semblance of life

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jill moans softly in her sleep face damp with sweat Moonlight
filters through the blinds and it is as if the lovers sleep in
the midst of a forest of metal trees the glistening branches and
reaching arms of Jills scrap sculptures silhouetted against the
silver glow
Glass eyes glint in the night and grotesque tortured faces peer
from the gloom Ventilation tubing coils through the trees like
snakes and a steel owl perches above the doorway its wingspan
lined with metallic feathers

Moonlight silvers the spider web and for a moment its strands
seem to fill the room Somewhere far back in the shadows
something moves Static flickers with a sputter across the
television screen A spark flies between synapses deep inside a
damaged silicon brain and a crimson gleam flickers momentarily
through the eyes of the steel skull

There is a HUM of energy and its memory banks light up The TV
screen dims for a second and the androids infrared retinas widen
as its disembodied head silently watches over the apartment
focusing on the two glowing heatforms that lie curled beside each
other on the bed

Jill moans again turning in her sleep

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE WASTELAND —- DAY

In her dream shes running across the dunes almost blind
buffeted by the stinging sand her hair whipping around her
Something dark emerges from the dust up ahead and slowly she
approaches it The curtain of sand parts revealing a steel hand
reaching from the earth

She falls to her knees and without understanding why begins
desperately to dig the wind helping her uncover something long
buried within the dune

A face appears staring up at her

Mos face terribly burned screaming mouth and eyeless sockets
filled with sand

She SCREAMS starting to her feet and when she tries to run Mos
metal hand grabs her by the ankle and holds her fast

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jill wakes with a start sitting up in the darkened room Mo is
still sleeping at her side and she lets out a little sigh of
relief when she sees him reaching out to touch him letting his
warmth reassure her She sits for a while in silence and then
making a decision she swings herself out of bed slips ona
crumpled silk kimono and heads for the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Jill absent-mindedly types a command into a wall console and the
automatic coffee maker percolator lights up chugging and
whirring contentedly to itself She opens the freezer to remove a
carton of synti-milk catching a glimpse of her face floating in
the dark glaze of the tiling illuminated momentarily by the dim
light of the refrigerator door The face seems disembodied
almost unrecognizable

INT LOUNGE - NIGHT

Jill picks her way through the debris cradling a steaming mug of
coffee She sits down in the middle of the room and crosses her
legs still feeling strangely disoriented She taps another joint
from an already half-empty pack of ‘Acapulco Gold and reaches
out to flick the televisions remote control turning up the
volume on a late-night news bulletin The NEWSCASTER smiles
reassuringly at her his voice silky and emotionless his hair
and complexion flawless probably computer generated

NEWSCASTER
The Department of Agriculture announced today
that further rationing under the new austerity
guidelines is likely in the wake of the soya
crop blight and the resulting forty percent
shortfall in the harvest The government has
announced plans to set up a special task force
to deal specifically with this problem and the
recent reports of widespread defiency-releated
diseases in the inner city

Jill takes another drag on the joint turning her attention to an
unfinished sculpture A collage of mutilated dolls welded by a
blowtorch into a single circular unit interlaced with barbed
wtre and rusty surgical implements

NEWSCASTER
Meanwhile public resistance to the emergency
population control bill continues to grow The
bill would mandate --

Jill flips the remote button channel and turning to a hardcore
pornography then to some music station where a nameless heavy
metal band is batting its way through its latest number by an
undulating sea of dancers surrounded upwards hands reaching
desperately outlined by a blue neon grid of laser beams

Jill smiles more at home now She scrambles over to the pile of
scrap and begins to shift through the androids remains The
torso is still largely intact almost humanoid above the waist
but degenerating below the hips into a truncated tangle of melted
cables and hydraulic tubing
Jill’s fingers lightly trace the course of a shrapnel wound and
she leans forward to try to make out a battered serial number and
what seems to be some kind of military insignia engraved on its
breastplate A stylized moon and a thunderbolt She counts four
arms three of them ending in slender hands with long delicately
jointed fingers while a fourth terminates in a rugged stump She
paws through the scrap frowning but the missing hand is nowhere
to be found

Two crumpled subsidiary arms project like insulated caterpiller
legs from the androids stomach one tapering into a jagged drill
bit and the other ending in a pair of rotating pincers

Jill smiles to herself glancing up at the unfinished doll
sculpture Then she hauls on a pair of paint-spattered
electricians gloves and begins to work

Mo stris gradually coming awake to the sound of heavv metal the
bass turned too high and the WHINE of a power saw in-operation
somewhere in the gloom behind him He sits up turning to see
Jill crouched over the androids remains still dressed in her
kimono but wearing welding goggles now and wielding a circular
saw

He can’t quite make out what shes doing but he can see sparks
the darkness the clenched line of her jaw and the hurting whites
of her eyes behind the goggles Rapt almost mesmeric in their
concentration

He rubs his eyes and yawns glancing at his watch He pulls on
his trousers and shambles over to the window lighting a
cigarette Behind him the power saw cuts off for a moment as Jill
changes to her airbrush setting to work on the androids head

He smiles neon washing over his face Jill stands raising the
androids severed head and placing it in the midst of the doll

fresco so that it forms a new centerpiece and Mo sees that she

has painted one side of the steel skull with light blue clouds

and the other with a dark star-studded sky He laughs and Jill
turns to him

MO
I like it

He takes a step toward her Unsure of himself

MO
The dolls are a nice touch Make a nice wreath

Her mouth tightens He tries again kiddingly
MO
Where does this stuff come from You seem so
normal on the surface

She decides to take him seriously

JILL
You know that new emergency bill theyre
pushing through

MO
The birth control thing

Jill nods at the ring of dolls

JILL
I started on this when I first heard about it

Mo gazes at the sculpture for a long time Then he starts to turn
around

MO
I dont get it

He picks up his shotgun Shoulders it Aiming out the window
Jill is glaring at his back

JILL
Why do I let you in Every time Why

He turns suddenly to her

MO
You wanna know why

JILL
Yes I do

MO
Ill show you why
(pointing)
Sit in that chair

She rolls her eyes

JILL
Mo I‘m trying to work

MO
You wanted to know Now go sit in the chair
She sits

She tips

JILL
No Its stupid

MO
Just go sit in the fucking chair okay

JILL
Okay okay Jesus If it makes you happy

in the chair
JILL
Okay now what

MO
Now tip yourself backslowly so the front
legs lift off the floor Like youre riding it

JILL
This is really stupid

MO
Go on Do it for me

JILL
Yeah yeah

the chair back keeping her balance with one foot

JILL
Okay Now what

MO
Let it go all the way Let yourself fall
Youll be all right

She starts to tip the chair backwards For a moment she teeters
on the verge of overbalancing and then laughing she drops
forward into an upright position Shaking her head

Mo steps

JILL
No

MO
Trust me Jill

JILL
No I cant do it No way

suddenly forward and pushes her hard in the chest She

topples backwards with a SHRIEK and hits the floor with a
resounding THUD

She lies on her back for a moment looking up at Mo standing over
her the shotgun still in his hands

Then she begins to laugh

MO
Fun huh

Mo kneels next to her grinning
MO
You cant hurt yourself Not if you fall right
Didnt I tell you

She puts one arm around him drawing him to her and they kiss

MO
They tell you not to look down when you climb a
cliff but why not The view is beautiful

JILL
(still smiling)
Youre so full of it

From the flat below comes the sound of muffled THUMPING as the
downstairs neighbors bang on their ceiling with a broom handle

JILL
Oh God the neighbors

Mo BANGS on the floor with his steel hand

MO
Fuck them

He drops the shotgun and grabs Jill dragging her across the
floor towards the bed He lifts her in his arms dumping her on
the mattress and scrambling on top of her pinning her down with
his knees For a moment they are quiet looking at each other He
reaches out brushing a strand from her face with his prostethic
hand

JILL
Moses

The phone RINGS A BURBLING electronic sound tangling in Jills
hair Mos hand twitches spastically She recoils with a yelp

MO
Shit
Jill starts to laugh untangling her hair The phone continues

RING Mo stands

MO

Its not funny Damn thing keeps getting radio
and TV signals confused with my nerve impulses

He crosses toward the main computer console Looking
contemplatively at the metal hind

MO
Im going to have to get it changed Circuits
are messed up anyway Sometimes I even feel
pain in it like my hands still there

to

The expression in Mos face makes her stop laughing He shrugs it

off and reaches for the phone She reaches out her hand -——

JILL
Dont answer it

Too late Hes picked up the vid-phone handset
MO

(into the phone)
Yeah

A familiar face flickers across the vid-screen peering out

through the rolling electronic bars

MO
Alvy

Alvy is furtive nervous

ALVY
I gotta see you Sorry to call so late
butits important

MO

Jesus Alvy Talk to me in the morning

ALVY
No It has to be now Im talking big bucks
savvy Meet me at the yard in an hour And
bring the uh skull and bones

MO
The what
(realizing)
No way I’m not selling it Thats final

ALVY
Just hear me out I cant talk over the phone
Too many ears See you in an hour

MO
Forget it

The dwarfs face disappears in a swirl of electronic snow Mo
hangs up Stands there Intrigued He stares at the blank screen
Jill is watching him Waiting for his next move He finally looks
at her Gives her a big warm smile Crosses toward her shaking
his head in exasperation

He climbs onto her Tipping her onto her back Giving her kiss
He looks her in the eye and shakes his head again

MO
Everythings a big emergency with Alvy

They kiss again

Across the room red embers glow deep in the eyes of the painted
metal skull

INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE — NIGHT

Alvy sits crouched beside work bench an island of flourescent
light adrift in the darkened warehouse He is bent over the
bench raising a jewelers lens to examine the severed mechanical
hand that lies before him He takes note of an engraved serial
number then pushes the hand to the side rummaging through a
sheath of blueprints printed on a dog-eared read-out paper until
he finds one that clearly matches the hand’s design

He leans closer examining an intricate schematic diagram
charting the hands wiring Red lettering is stencilled across
one corner of the blueprint MARK 13 PROTOTYPE -AUTHORIZED
ACCESS ONLY

Something in the schematic seems to excite him and he lifts a
gold pocket watch by its chain to check the time

INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

The room is still and dark Neon glow blinks in a slat-pattern on
the ceiling The mute TV flickers and flashes

Jill is peacefully asleep
Mo is moving stealthily about the apartment dressing He sits
carefully on the edge of the bed to lace up his boots Jill sighs
in her sleep Stirs

Mo waits till she settles back and gives her a soft kiss on the
cheek A small contented smile rises out of her dreams and breaks
on her lips

MO
(whispering)
Ill be back
He stands and heads for the door

EXT STAIRWELL — NIGHT

The apartments door HISSES open and Mo stands alone on the
threshold wrapped in a shapeless military coat his hands in his
pockets He hesitates uneasily for a moment before stepping into
the waiting darkness and making for the elevator He hears a
stealthy sound behind him and pauses nervously typing a command
into the lifts control console one hand touching the butt of
his shotgun

Several ragqed shapes detach themselves from the night drifting
slowly toward him CHILDREN three of them not even in their
teens ringworm already in their hair their grubby faces thin
and spotted with sores their eyes glistening hungrily in the
half-light

For a moment hes not sure how to react then he sets his jaw and
waves at them in a threatening manner

MO
How did you get up here Go on Get the fuck
out of here

The children stand their ground not daring to come closer

and at the same time unwilling to give up The lift door swishes
open and Mo steps quickly into the narrow grafitti-scarred
cubicle

INT LIFT
The lift door doses and the children are gone from sight and the
car is dropping toward the street Mo breathes a sigh of relief

drawing the coat more tightly around himself He mutters

MO
Goddamn Chief
He looks at his face in the doors cracked and cloudy mirror
His eyes seem lost and worried strangely disoriented He
shivers trying to pull himself together

EXT STREET - NIGHT

The lift door swishes open and Mo walks hastily through the
lobby stepping over the sleeping DRIFTERS as he makes for the
street Outside the rush of traffic and the stench of the gutters
enfold him the feeling of anonymity affording him it lends him
some little comfort

He steps into the street hailing a pedi-cab not looking back
The cab stops He trots after it

HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN ON MO

A motorized shutter CLICKS three times freezing his image on
heat-sensitive 35mm the auto-wind WHIRRING

INT APARTMENT IN ADJACENT TOWER BLOCK - NIGHT

Lincoln is crouched by the window following Mo through the lens
of his camera

LINCOLN
Thats it loverboy Just keep on walking

He pans his camera up once more to focus on the window of Jills
apartment

INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jill rolls over the sheets tangling around her Muttering in her
sleep

Somewhere far back in the cluttered apartment something moves and
comes to life

The red light glimmers in the eyes of the androids severed head
With an almost imperceptible electronic whir its microchip mind
wakes up watching over the apartment from its perch in the midst
of a nest of barbed wire and burned dolls

The androids irises widen like black holes slowly expanding

INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The androids severed hand shivers fingers shifting minutely
delicately touching the table-top as if trying to orient itself
Alvy is oblivious to the hand movement too busy studying the
minutely detailed blueprints spread out before him to notice
anything else

INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT
A bank of LEDs light up on the main computer console A low
whine of feedback crackles from the intercom and static hazes the
television screen Jill groans turning irritably on the bed

Down on the floor the androids dismembered limbs shiver as life
returns to them jointed fingers tapping on the floor artificial
muscles flexing slowly hydraulic tubing twisting fluid flowing
back into damaged veins

A dark pool of grease spreads like blood across the carpet
INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Alvy detects a furtive movement out of the corner of his eye and
looks up from his work

The severed hand has vanished

The dwarf starts to his feet checking the floor seeing nothing
but bare concrete

He lifts the blueprints searching the tabletop suddenly
bewildered

Behind him the hand scuttles deftly along a rack of spare
freezing for Alvy looks around a moment in the shadow of an oil
can as then scampering up to perch like a spider on the head of a
deactivated servo-robot

Alvy is already beginning to suspect the truth when he hears

the soft metallic tapping coming from the shelf behind him
Slowly he turns half guessing what he is about to see his heart
beating faster anyway Then he sees the hand one finger tapping
impatiently against the servo-robots cranium

The hand seems to know hes watching and freezes once more

ALVY
(under his breath)
I1l be goddamned

He takes a step closer pulling on a pair of heavy rubber gloves
The hand remains motionless

The dwarf reaches slowly out biting his lower lip nervously
Then his fingers touch it and in an instant the hand is
scuttling up his arm faster than he can move feeling its way
toward his face He recoils trying to brush it off but it is
already at his throat and he can feel its steel fingers

trying to get a grip on his windpipe

He grabs at the stump of the wrist frantically trying to tug the
hand away He stumbles back catching a chair behind his knees

and losing his balance He cries out as he goes down scrabbling
at the tabletop as he goes down but succeeds only in pulling the
blueprints down on top of him He hits the floor hard and the
hand is already grasping at his face feeling for his eyes

INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

The light blazes bright as hot coals now in the androids eyes
A coat rack falls with a CLATTER to the floor and Jill stirs
hovering between sleep and waking The floor of the room is
alive now hands twitching and hopping wiring sparking in the
gloom

INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE — NIGHT

The sliding doors RATTLE as Mo pushes them open on their runners
and steps into the darkened warehouse Their is a flourescent
light burning at the far end of the room behind a rack of
accessories and Mo can hear the sounds of a violent scuffle
interspersed with YELPS of pain

MO
Alvy

ALVY (0S)
(thick and muffled)
AH FUCK HELP ME MOSES

Mo runs down the main aisle of the warehouse to find Alvy
thrashing on the floor amidst the crumpled blueprints clutching
at his throat his legs kicking

MO
What the fuck

ALVY
GET IT OFF AAAAGH GET IT OFF ME YOU
SHITHEAD

Mo crouches quickly pinning the screaming dwarf to the floor
with

his knees and pulling at the hand At first it resists then in
a moment of confusion it releases Alvy and tries to grab at Mo
but he already has it by the wrist and its fingers are too short
to reach him

He stands slowly staring at the hand in disbelief its fingers
clawing helplessly at the air

Alvy sits up rubbing his throat Dark purple bruises mark his
flesh bloodstains dappling his shirt dripping from a row of
almost surgical incisions in his face and neck Alvy mops at the
blood with his handkerchief his hand trembling

ALVY
Oh GodImbleeding

MO
Youre all right Where did you get this

ALVY
Itit was in that pile of junk you sold me I
didntI didnt notice it till after you
left Its part of theMark 13

MO
The what

Alvy peers about Mos body frowning

ALVY
Mark 13 You didnt bring the rest of it

MO
Wait a minute The android What do you know
about it What is it

Alvy stands and points at him

ALVY
Its a more sophisticated version of you

MO
I thought it was a maintenance drone

ALVY
Uhwell no So did I But then I got my
hands on these blueprints See

Alvy hops eagerly onto the bench seat pawing through the
blueprint pages Mo steps close to the bench peering over Alvys
shoulder Alvy keeps one eye on the hand in Mos grip

ALVY

This is the guy who is gonna make you obsolete
Youll be the maintenance drone

(pointing at the hand)
Hes got three more of those where that came
from as well as four subsidiary arms More
legs than a fucking spider Its designed to
operate in the field out of radio contact
working on its own initiative even making its
own repairs Its the closest thing to real
artificial intelligence money can buy and its
got just one primary function

INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jill lies curled on the bed her eves twitching beneath their
lids deep in a dream Behind her the movement has become more
organized Steel fingers tighten bolts and seal damaged tubing
rebuilding its body piece by piece dismembered limbs acting
under the silent command of the severed head

Slowly almost painfully the creature swings its torso upright
using its lower arms like legs stretching itself as if awakening
from a deep sleep

Slowly Mark 13 returns to life

INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Alvy turns proudly from the blueprints to Mo

ALVY
It can lie dormant for decades and recharge
itself anytime from any power grid even from
the sun if necessary It can see in the dark
and move faster and quieter than the most
highly trained combat soldier Its got mind-
bending drugs inside it worse than cyanide It
can kill you in seconds and even make you enjoy
it

Mo is staring at a blinking LED on the back of the hand

MO
Whats with this light Is it malfunctioning

He sounds almost hopeful

ALVY
Oh no Its functioning fine Thats a warning
that its electrified Youre lucky the storage
battery is kept in the chest cavity Otherwise
-- Z2Z2Z2T The little bastard wouldve put more
current through you than an electric chair

MO
Wheres the phone Ive gotta call Jill

ALVY
(reproachfully)
I told you to bring it with you

MO
Just point me to the phone Alvy

ALVY
Now Slow down Cant we do some business
first Thats what you came here for

Mo steps menacingly toward him

MO

The phone goddamnit
ALVY

250 Cs Cash

Mo thrusts the wriggling hand at him Alvy recoils the blood
draining from his face the hand straining to reach him

MO
Here Ill give you this one for free Around
the neck Now wheres the fucking phone

ALVY
(pointing across room)
Over there Over there Jeesh Youll need change

Mo carefully holds the hand out to Alvy Wrist first Alvy shakes
his head

MO
Take it

Alvy takes it blanching Mo heads for the phone digging into
his pockets Alvy holds the flexing hand at arms length Has to
marvel at it Raises his voice for Mo

ALVY
Apparently they were testing a bunch of them
out on the dune sea but there was a fuck up
Seems there was one structural defect An
Achilles heel in the insulation system

Mo hurries up to the vid-phone console pulling change from his
pocket coins bouncing off the concrete floor He feeds change
into the slot frantically types a number

INT JILLS APARTMENT

The vid-phone lights up the screen an incoming call signal
flashing across but almost as soon as it begins to RING the
receiver is lifted from its hook Mo’s face flickers across the
screen his eyes wide and nervous

INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE

Mo stands clutching the receiver staring into the fuzzy video
monitor He bangs the side of the console trying to get a
picture

MO
Hello Hello Jill

A soft electric whir comes over the receiver almost like the
purr of a cat

The screen flickers and for an instant Mo glimpses something A
dark shape staring back at him eyes like hot coals Then the
line goes dead and the image disintegrates in a HISS of WHITE
NOISE

The call charge flickers on screen

A stream of coins cascades from the slot rattling across his
boots

INT JILLS APARTMENT

A wisp of blue smoke rises from the vid-phone receiver and the
steel hand that holds it tightens its grasp There is a sound
like frying bacon and the receiver slowly begins to melt

INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE

Mo leans on the console groaning to himself hands massaging his
forehead

MO
Jesus Oh Jesus Jill

Then a thought occurs to him and he quickly types another number
into the vid-phone feeding it more change The phone rings for a
while and Mo shuffles his feet uneasily

MO
Come oncome on

The screen flickers and a familiar face appears the sound of
distant sitar music coming over the receiver

SHADES
Ayuh
He grins at Mo seemingly naked save for his dark glasses

MO
Shades I need your help

SHADES
Hey uhwow umits cool butright now

MO

Oh Jeez OhChrist It had to be tonight

He laughs nervously

MO

My heart feels like an alligator

MO

SHADES

MO

Oh no
SHADES

Yeah I dropped it LikeChristmas can get

night The skys so beautiful

INT SHADES APARTMENT

Shades sits cross-legged in front of the console wearing only a
pair of boxing shorts the vid-phone receiver cradled in one
hand candles burning everywhere Books on eastern philosophy and
mysticism are spread on the floor around him their pages open to
intricate mazes and mandalas

The lights in the room are turned down and outside the picture
window the stars really are beautiful
Shades hears a soft thud and looks up from the console
momentarily distracted

There is a moth outside beating against the glass its wings
silver in the moonlight

Shades smiles and getting to his feet takes a step toward the
window entranced by the waiting stars

He reaches out to touch the glass Mos voice growing faint and
far away but still insistent

MO
Hey Hey Listen to me Come back Youve got
to do this for me Youve got to go down to the
apartment and get Jill out of there right
nowShades

Shades turns back to the screen Blinks Finally nods

SHADES
Yeah yeah Okay

MO
(softly)
Hurry Shades Im counting on you

SHADES

MO

SHADES
Oh yeah Noooooo problem See ya Bye

Shades smiles and hangs up the receiver standing silent for a
moment listening to the dull flutter of the moths wings beating
against the glass

INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE

The vid-screen goes dead and Mo turns toward the door taking a
deep breath He draws the shotgun from holster and checks to make
sure its loaded

MO
Alvy Call the police and give them my address
Then take that thing that hand and melt
it down Turn up the heat until theres nothing
left and I dont want you to think once
about what it might be worth Its mine by
rights anyway

All right Ill do it Little bastards no

Thanks Alvy Maybe you are human after all

ALVY
Nah Ive just got a soft spot for an

Alvy points after him with the truncated hand Mo reholsters the
shotgun and steps out the warehouse doors The night swallows him

up
INT JILLS APARTMENT — NIGHT

Mark 13 moves slowly through the lounge infra-red eyes cutting
through the gloom purring contentedly to itself as it examines
the main computer terminal and then lollops on toward the bed It
halts looking down at Jill registering her sleeping form as a
glowing puddle of energy
A printout rattles through its brain
HEATFORM 35 DEGREES CELSIUS HUMAN
RANGE 05 METERS

It reaches almost tenderly toward her and she turns sighing in
her sleep Then suddenly it pauses raising its head as if
listening for something its irises widening microscopically

EXT SCRAPYARD - NIGHT

Alvy walks slowly down an avenue of rusting cars gingerly
clutching the wriggling hand steam drifting all around him He
stops in front of one of the scrapyards low brick blast furnaces
and stands silent as if in thought Then with one deft movement
he opens the furnace door and hurls the hand inside immediately
SLAMMING the door He spins a metal wheel sealing the furnace
and turning up the heat He leans forward firelight shimmering
on his face peering through the reinforced glass of the narrow
furnace window watching the severed hand scamper frantically
around its prison fingers scratching at the brickwork Tongues
of fire flicker up through a grate in the floor and the hand goes
crazy flinging itself at the window

Alvy steps back wiping his forehead The temperature rises and
the hand glows red its outline softening as it begins to melt
Theres no way out but still it refuses to give up hurling
itself again at the walls still banging frantically at the door
now just a jittering ball of fire

INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jill comes suddenly awake sitting up in bed knowing that
something is wrong She looks around to the other side of the
bed for Mo Hes not there Just flat crumpled sheets A sharp
burst of STATIC comes from the television and she looks to it
Somethings wrong with the set

The sound is distorted muted as if underwater and the image has
become vague and shadowy abstract tinged with green

She stares at it shaking her head in confusion Behind her
something glistens in the dark pulling itself up to its full
height poising like a cobra about to strike

JILL
-Mo

She sees the remote control lying at the foot of the bed and

reaches forward to pick it up and that movement is the only thing
that saves her A steel claw whistles past her head so close she
can feel its wind The mattress shivers beneath her bulging down
under the weight of something only half-glimpsed thats climbing
over the head of the bed impossibly quickly

She YELLS diving head first onto the floor hitting the ground
all wrong a dreamy puff of feathers going up around her as the
creature rips the mattress apart in a frenzy of tearing fabric
and thrashing claws

INT APARTMENT IN ADJACENT TOWER BLOCK

Lincoln shivers the remote lead jumping in his hand not
understanding what he sees Everything across the way is a tangle
of movement Something big the size of a large dog has taken
the girl’s place on the bed and seems to be eating the mattress
He squints through the lens trying to figure out what it is but
it refuses to conform with anything he’s seen before He thinks
he glimpses a pair of glowing red eyes and a bobbing almost
human head and shoulders but the arms and legs are all wrong a
blur of motion limbs twitching like a big clockwork spider

He sits back shaking his head

LINCOLN
I’m losing it I’m fucking losing it

Unable to resist he bends to the camera again and recoils almost
immediately crying out retaining only an image of eyes like
windows into hell He cant shake the conviction that whatever it
is was watching him right through the lens waiting for him to
take a look and now its seen him Now it knows his face

He sits back nervously picking at his acne the beginnings of an
idea taking form in his head

INT JILLS APARTMENT

Jill crouches against the wall still clutching the remote in her
hand a blizzard of feathers falling all around her

The thing seems to be building a nest in the bed pulling the
sheets tight around itself

She starts to edge past it crawling slowly backwards toward the
door trying not to look too steadily at it the childish notion
occuring to her that if she cant see it then maybe it cant see
her A sob starts to rise inside her and she bites her lip to
stay quiet When she opens her eyes again the creature is gone
Only the gaping claw marks in the mattress and the twisted sheets
remain to show that it even existed She glances around herself
shivering eyes straining into the shadows seeing nothing but
the feathers lazily drifting down past the blue strobe of the
television screen

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Mo is running breathing hard his head thrown back his coat
fluttering around him A pedi-cab cruises past and he chases
after it raising his hand

MO
Hey Taxi TAXI STOP

The pedi-cab speeds up and off Mo giving up slowing to catch
his breath Then he forces himself on again moaning softly to
himself his feet keeping time with the beat of the blood in his
temples

INT JILLS APARTMENT — NIGHT

Jill gets slowly to her feet every muscle in her body tensed
eyes darting from side to side as she backs toward the door Her
foot strikes something and she recoils She looks down and
breaths a sigh of relief seeing her blow-torch lying on the
floor where she left it

She kneels and tentatively lifting it pulls on the trigger
igniting a thin blue tongue of gas

She backs toward the doorway holding the blow-torch at arms
length feeling comforted by its glow Then she looks up and
something she sees takes her breath away The androids head is
missing from its place in the center of the scrap sculpture
Slowly the truth begins to dawn on her

JILL
Oh my God

She turns stepping across the threshold into the darkened
hallway crouching defensively eyes searching the gloom
expecting the worst She makes it as far as the door and
nervously reaches out to type the exit code into the wall
console Her fingers brush the keyboard and in the same instant
the doorbell BUZZES She types in the four digit code and sighs
with relief as the door HISSES open on its runners

She starts forward

JILL
Mo thank God
She freezes in her tracks A shadowy figure is standing on the
threshold A gust of warm air through the doorway snuffs flame of
her torch Lincoln Weinberg Jr lifts a camera to his eye

She nods tight-lipped His eyes dance up and down the length of
her body She suddenly realizes that shes wearing only the
skimpy kimono --

LINCOLN
You must have pretty weird taste in men

-- and that she has a blow-torch in her hand She points it at

JILL
(backing away)
Oh Jesus

The door HISSES shut behind him

LINCOLN
Whoops

JILL
Oh God no

LINCOLN

The sound of loud HEAVY METAL comes crashing from the lounge and
the lights the hallway flicker Lincoln looks bemusedly around

LINCOLN
Whoa Whats going on around here

JILL
Theres an android running amok in my lounge

LINCOLN

cae

JILL
My boyfriend brought it home with him from the
zone It must have reactivated itself I dont

out of here

LINCOLN
Its okay Take it easy We can go to my place

Jill shoves him aside and types a series of digits into the wall
console Nothing happens

JILL
Why doesnt it work

LINCOLN
Someones activated the emergency override You
can only unlock it from the main terminal

JILL
How do you know

LINCOLN
I used to be with the security and surveillance
company that installed all the remote cameras
and safety locks in this block a few years ago
You made me coffee while I was here

JILL
(shaking her head)

I dont remember

LINCOLN
Thats okay I dont mind

The light flickers again and the music cuts off

JILL
There is

Now what
LINCOLN
It sounds like somethings overloading the

power grid

another abrupt BURST of sound and then silence again

JILL
Mr Lincoln Im scared Can you get us out of
here

LINCOLN

JILL
In the living room But --

LINCOLN

He peels

LINCOLN

it from her grip and heads down the hall

JILL
All right Keep talking so I know where you are

LINCOLN

JILL
Please

LINCOLN
All right

toward the lounge brandishing the blow torch while

Jill crouches beside the locked door her back against the wall

LINCOLN
Hello in there Any androids in there Come out
come out

Lincoln vanishes into the gloom For a moment there is silence

Then the

HEAVY METAL MUSIC comes on again louder than before
JILL
(shouting)
Lincoln
(pause)
Lincoln

Lincolns voice comes back to her yelling from the lounge

LINCOLN (0S)
Its okay Im in here Ive found the terminal
Theres nothing in here

She furrows her brow doubtfully After a moment she tiptoes back
into the lounge and sees Lincoln standing beside the bed staring
at the claw marks in the mattress He looks at her with a bit of
a leer

LINCOLN
Hot night huh

Jill isnt really listening Her gaze is scanning the room

LINCOLN
You and the boyfriend really tore up the sheets
Heh

Shes still looking worriedly about He follows her gaze
Shrugging

LINCOLN

JILL

LINCOLN
Your boyfriends

JILL
-Moses

LINCOLN
Moses Jeez Some name Hes not around much is
he You should get a guy who doesnt leave you
alone so much

JILL
You can stop talking now
His face goes blank for a second Then he grins

LINCOLN
What if i sing You want me to sing

JILL
I dont care Just get us out of here

LINCOLN
(crossing to the console)
Lets see um how about this

(snapping his fingers)
Dum Dum Dum

(typing on the keyboard)
Oh we all walk the wibberlee wobberlee WALK
Oh we all talk the wibberlee wobberlee TALK
And we all wear wibberlee wobberlee TIES
And we look at all the pretty girls with
wibberlee wobberlee eyes Oh - kay That should
do it

He gives her an amiable smile She gestures toward the door with
her head

JILL
Good Lets go

He frowns Bites his lower lip

LINCOLN
Wait Whyd you

She just wants out

JILL
Whyd I what

LINCOLN
Nothing I just wanna

JILL
Wanna what

LINCOLN
Your blinds

JILL
What about them
The window blinds are closed The ones through which Lincoln was
watching her He starts off toward them snapping his fingers
again Trying to act casual

LINCOLN
Dum Dum Dum Oh we all sing the the wibberlee
wobberlee song Until day is daw-ning

He crosses the window making a feeble attempt at dancing
looking quite absurd in his baseball cap and Hawaiian shirt
clutching the blow-torch in one hand

LINCOLN
And we all have that wibberlee wobberlee feeling
in the morning
(smiling back at her)
You dont want to keep these closed You wont
see Santa Claus coming

He pulls the sash opening the blinds A red light falls across
him and his smile freezes There is a face looking back at him
from the other side of the blinds A thin malevolent face with
eyes like fire one side dark as night ablaze with the stars
the other a misty blue blur of airbrushed clouds

It seems to smile at him and he notices that its teeth are
hypodermic needles

He realizes that he should try to get back but he cant seem to
tear himself away from the creatures gaze Slowly the angel
reaches out for him the slats of the blinds crumpling around it
and as if from a great distance he hears Jill begin to scream
Steel hands enfold him and he feels himself lifted from the
ground

He gives himself over to the embrace the blow-torch dropping
from his numbed fingers

Perhaps this is what he came for

Perhaps this at last is love This angel places a hand on his
face as if in absolution Sparks dance in his eyes and he begins
to burn His legs twitch dancing in the air

There is a smell like burning rubber

His axial vertebrae dislocates with a sharp CRACK and blue smoke
rises in a plume from his hair Then in a final instant of white
hot ecstacy the angel slides a power drill into his groin and
its electrified fingers punch through his eyes into his brain

Everything lets go at once blood and urine jetting across the
Venetian blinds To the the androids heat sensors the blood is a
liquid golden light It opens up more holes with its drill
letting out the light digging deep into the husk looking for
the source The light washes over its hands and then begins to
fade Mark 13 lets Lincoln crumple to the floor still sitting
astride him riding out his final spasms smoke rising all around
it

Slowly the light dies

Jill SCREAMS and SCREAMS trying to shut out the wet tearing
sounds as the android disembowels him the drill WHINING sharply
as it grates against one of his ribs

Mark 13 twitches ecstatically banging Lincolns head against the
floor as it works its fingers ever deeper into his skull

INT APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS

One of the neighbors a middle-aged Chinese WOMAN in a dowdy blue
nightgown climbs onto a table and begins to BANG on the ceiling
with a broom handle

INT JILLS APARTMENT

Mark 13 drops the messy remains of Lincolns head with a dull
thump its limbs suddenly still listening to the banging on the
floor realizing somewhere deep inside its damaged brain that it
still has work to do

It pivots around infra-red eyes searching for the girl

INT HALLWAY

Jill is frantically stabbing the code into the wall console
She steps back waiting for the door to open It doesnt

JILL
No

She swallows a scream Trying the code Trying to rein herself
in Carefully pressing each digit

Nothing happens She hits the keypad with her fist
INT GUARDROOM - NIGHT

Chief and Vernon sit hunched over a chess board CHINESE ROCK N
ROLL turned up to full volume on Chiefs transistor radio
echoing off bare concrete walls that are lined with video
monitors and pages torn from pin-up magazines Vernon takes one
of Chiefs pawns grinning the end of his tongue pinched between
his front teeth

VERNON
Pow Pow Pow Boom
Chief slides his bishop across the board

CHIEF
Check and mate

Vernon slaps himself on the head

VERNON
Oh wha Howd you do that I didnt see that
coming

Vernon bends over the board peering myopically at the pieces
retracing the move

CHIEF
Sicilian manuever Thats how you beet computers
when you play ‘em Machines dont understand
sacrifice and neither do morons

Chief cuffs Vernon hard across the ear sending him tumbling from
his stool

CHIEF
Read some chess books you jerk

VERNON
(holding his head)
Ow Ow-wow-wow

INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jill is leaning her forehead against the cool metal of the door
Stymied Something CLATTERS loudly in the room behind her and she
turns with a whimper

INT LOUNGE

Red light touches the spider web as Mark 13 peers into the tank
It sees movement in the web and detects life but there is no
temperature reading Mark 13 inclines its head as if in thought
then raises one hand trying to attract the spiders attention
Its steel fingers scratch against the glass but the spider
doesnt respond

The androids retinas expand watching but not understanding
INT HALLWAY
Jill hears the sound of breaking glass She feels the urge to

scream and raises her hand biting it hard almost drawing blood
She peers into the gloom A soft mechanical whir comes from the
darknesss and she pulls back flattening herself against the
wall

The whir grows louder and another sound grows with it The throb
of an engine turning over slowly gaining power gears whining
impatiently She closes her eyes and jams her hands over her
ears

Suddenly the lights come on in the hallway and music comes
BLARING at full volume

Silent night Holy night
Jill shakes her head slowly back and forth

JILL
(quietly)
Oh God help me

The carol plays on

All is calm All is bright
INT LOUNGE

Mark 13s sitting at the central terminal now riding the
console its nervous system plugged directly into the main frame
sparks flying all around it fingers twitching wildly across the
keyboard

INT HALLWAY

The lights blink off again and Jill begins to edge down the
passage keeping her back to the wall The Christmas carol stops
then starts again coming at her in disorienting spurts She
reaches the kitchen door and the lights go on again then start
to blink rapidly reaching the hypnotic frequency of a strobe
before sparking and shorting out entirely

Jill backs into the darkened kitchen The timer bell goes off in
the microwave behind her and she spins fearfully around She sees
the LEDs flashing chaotically on the wall console and her
blender WHIRRING out of control a thin blue ribbon of smoke
pouring from its motor

The coffee maker overboils with a splutter and she pulls back as
scalding liquid sprays across the counter She sees a red slow
rising from the overheating toaster and an electric carving knife
lies WHIRRING and twitching to itself on the sideboard

Then suddenly everthing goes quiet She looks up knowing whats
going to come next A movement flickers in the hallway and she
sees the gleam of two red eyes cutting through the darkness their
beams highlighted like lasers by the drifting smoke She pulls
back against the wall whimpering knowing shes come to a dead
end

Then in a flash of inspiration she realizes something

JILL
(under her breath)
Infra-red The bastards working on infra-red

She crouches pulling open the freezer and frantically ripping
out its shelves sending the contents clattering to the floor
She hears the whir of servo-motors as the android approaches and
without another thought she climbs into the freezer curling
herself up to make herself as small as possible She shivers her
bare skin brushing against frosted metal She rams her hand into
her mouth trying to remain absolutely still trying not to even
breath

Infra-red eyes pierce the darkness of the kitchen and the android
appears silhouetted in the doorway its steel claws SCRATCHING on
the linoleum Its head revolves with a WHIR and for a moment its
looking right at her then it looks past her and away WHIRRING
angrily to itself Suddenly it swings itself across floor so
quickly that Jill almost loses sight of it It reaches out and
wrenches the cupboard door off its hinges There is an explosion
of SHATTERING crockery Jill stifles a yell as shards of broken
porcelain rattle to the floor around her

The wreckage subsides and the android freezes standing inhumanly
still head cocked to one side as if listening Jill holds her
breath her eyes wandering across the Formica countertop
lighting at last on the thing shes been looking for

The circular power saw she was using earlier that evening lying
now on a shelf opposite the freezer beside her airbrush and two
cans of polyurethane spray paint Then her eyes fall to the space
below the shelf and she sees the two cylinders of oxy-acetylene
gas and a plan of action begins to take form in her head

She breaths out slowly watching fearfully as her breath steams
in the light of the open freezer

Now the android sees the plume of steam

Now it turns

Now its looking right at her and she returns its stare without
flinching
It hops toward her head still cocked to one side heat sensors
confused by the cold air streaming from the freezer It stops
only an arms length away from her and reaching out blindly
begins to feel its way around the cold spot

Jill cowers back as far as she can numbed by the cold gradually
creeping into her trying to will herself not to shiver The
androids hand narrowly misses her foot closing on a jar of
mayonnaise It withdraws the jar holding it up for closer
inspection Its fingers tighten and the jar shatters mayonnaise
spattering to the floor in big round globules

Jill gasps involuntarily The android drops the remains of the
jar and reaches back into the freezer its hand feeling its way
toward her trembling face Then from far off in the apartment
comes the sound of the doorbell ringing

The android freezes again deadly still its fingertips barely an
inch from Jills terrified eves

INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT
Shades stands outside the locked door shifting uneasily from
foot to foot chewing a piece of bubble gum He presses the

doorbell again frowning Then he BANGS on it with his fist

SHADES
JILL HEY JILL YOU IN THERE

INT KITCHEN

Jill hears the muffled knocking but doesnt dare move a muscle
She holds her breath trying not to let her heart beat too fast
The steel hand wavers before her eyes

INT STAIRWAY

Shades shakes his head dumbfounded

SHADES
Jeez

He leans back against the railing crossing his arms and blowing
a big sticky bubble

INT KITCHEN

The steel hand wavers and falls withdrawing from the freezer
Jill breathes out softly

The android takes a step backwards its head pivoting toward the
door
Jill inches forward her eyes on the power saw Its lying just
in front of her its handle sticking out over the edge of the
shelf

The android takes another step toward the doorway and Jill slowly
reaches out holding her breath again The android pauses
Listening She leans further forward and her hand fastens on the
power saws hilt her fingers so numb with cold she can barely
feel it

After that everything happens really fast The android turns in
one fluid movement its eyes finding her And Jill is already on
her feet brandishing the power saw with both hands And the
android is coming across the kitchen at her in a horrid blur of
motion And she could swear its grinning at her And then the
power saw BUZZES into life and shes screaming at the top of her
lungs

JILL
EAT THIS MOTHERFUCKER

The saw descends in a furious arc and the android flings up one
hand to shield its face suddenly realizing its peril There is a
flash of sparks and three of the androids fingers go clattering
to the floor where they lie twitching like inch-worms The saw
blade catches the creature in the chest and Jill SCREAMS as a
streak of sparks and metal splinters fountain into the air The
android screams too and for the first time Jill hears Mark 13’s
voice a terrible mechanical MEWLING so low its more felt than
heard like a bass note from a synthesizer

The creature shakes itself arms flailing wildly and Jill feels
her own arm laid open from the elbow down almost to the bone by
one of the thrashing talons There is a sharp metallic CLANG as a
claw strikes one of the oxy-acetylene cylinders and a jet of
compressed gas begins to SCREAM from a ruined valve The android
lunges backwards jerking the power saw out of her hands

It collides with the remains of the cupboard and loses its
balance writhing amidst the broken crockery trying to dislodge
the blade from its chest sparks leaping from its joints

It flings the spinning blade away and the saw sails across the
room into the lounge

Jill cant stop screaming but her scream is a cry of rage She
grabs one of the spray cans and then begins to fumble desperately
with the valve of the second oxy-acetylene cylinder blood
running in rivulets down her arm There is a high-pitched WHISTLE
and she staggers back as the valve opens venting the tanks
contents in a thin vaporous stream
Laughing and crying at the same time Jill tumbles toward the
door coughing as the room fills with gas The android lunges
forward hydraulic fluid dripping thickly from its chest and its
steel fingers encircle her ankle She falls with a SHRIEK
clawing at the hall carpet with blood-slick hands remorselessly
pulled back inch by inch into the gas-filled kitchen There is
a loud WHINE and she sees the androids drill arm spin into life
reaching slowly up between her bare legs She brandishes the
spray can in one hand and then reaching in her pocket she
triumphantly withdraws her cigarette lighter

EXT STAIRWAY

Mo comes pounding up the last flight of steps his face livid
with exertion

MO
JILL

He sees Shades standing near the apartment door and grabs him
shaking him so violently that his dark glasses almost fly off

MO
Where is she

SHADES
Hey I dont know man She wouldnt answer the
door

Mo practically hurls him down the steps

MO
THEN GET HELP

Mo flings himself against the door POUNDING his fists on the
steel plating

MO
JILL JILL IM COMING

He WAILS in frustration tears welling in his eyes

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

The SHRIEK of escaping gas fills the room almost drowning out
the sound of Jills cries

The spinning drill arm hangs over her poising itself with
surgical precision
She lashes out at the androids face with her free foot as the
creature hunkers closer to her its retinas widening in
anticipation She snarls at it her face twisted in rage and
reaching suddenly out with the spray can she draws a line of
black polyurethane paint across its eyes The android WHINES
clutching at its face and Jill kicks free from its

grip plunging backwards down the corridor

She loses her footing and goes down on one knee as she pulls the
pack of Acapulco Gold from her pocket

Already the android is looking for her again crouching in the
kitchen doorway gathering its energy for another attack She
spins the lighter

kindling the whole packet waiting impatiently for the flames to
take hold She looks up right into the androids eyes a thin
smile touching her lips Then she staggers to her feet hurling
the blazing cigarette pack and diving for cover The android
reaches out and effortlessly snatches the blazing pack from the
air like a star outfielder

Then everything EXPLODES
EXT STAIRWAY

The locked door shudders and Mo SCREAMS flinging himself against
the steel plating

INT JILLS APARTMENT

Jill covers her head with her hands as shards of hot metal rain
around her Her sleeve catches fire and she rolls on the ground
to smother it crawling across the blackened carpet toward the
lounge

Somewhere a fire alarm has begun to RING

The air seems filled with oily wisps like seeds from a black
dandelion and looking up she sees that the kitchen simply isnt
there anymore The doorway at the end of the hallway is acting
like a chimney the air shimmering with heat

She catches the flames for a while half expecting something to
move within the inferno and then something does but it is only a
blazing wall-fitting subsiding in a cloud of sparks She stares
into the flames until the sweat evaporates and she feels her
eyebrows shrivel Then satisfied at last she gets to her feet
and limps back into the lounge cradling her wounded arm against
her chest
She stands on the threshold surveying her apartment The tangled
scrap sculpture The twisted Venetian blinds and blood-stained
walls The torn sheets and gutted mattress The melted telephone
receiver dangling slackly on its cord Lincolns body sprawled
beside the window his Hawaiian shirt dark with drying blood a
white drift of feathers strewn all around him

She shakes her head

JILL
God What a fucking mess

The steel door HISSES open at the end of the hall and she feels
the cool night wind on her body and she turns to see Mo
silhouetted in the doorway Chief and Vernon on either side of
him craning their necks to see inside

Mo seems frightened

She starts forward shrugging to show its all right and then as
if in a dream she sees him draw his shotgun and level it at her
head

MO
GET DOWN

She SCREAMS and dives headlong to the floor feeling something
hot whistle past the back of her neck She rolls hugging the
carpet catching a brief glimpse of an inhuman figure standing
over her

A writhing jittering column of living fire

Then the shotgun jumps in Mos hands and the burning android is
blown backwards through the doorway into the lounge Mo dashes
past her followed by the Chief and Vernon and she hears him
reload the shotgun

Then someones standing beside her lifting her in his arms She
buries her face in Shades flight jacket and begins to cry

INT LOUNGE

Mo stands in the doorway the shotgun cradled in his arms Chief
and Vernon flanking him clutching their automatics

CHIEF
(looking at the devastation)
Jesus Christ

The android stands beside the console wisps of flame rising from
it like tongues of fire in a religious fresco As one they level
their firearms and the creature lunges toward them tracking
flame across the carpet emitting a DEEP BASS TONE as it comes
Mos shotgun leaps in his arms and the creature whirls frenziedly
across the room taking the full force of the blast Chief and
Vernon OPEN FIRE with their automatics their bullets RICOCHETING
off the androids titanium shell It lunges backwards against the
window and the glass in one of the panes CRACKS behind it

It tries to come at them again its arms tangling in the remains
of the Venetian blinds Mo slips another shell into his shotgun
and steps forward SHOOTING it in the chest Part of the
androids breastplate disintegrates in a mass of sparks and then
the window finally gives way

For a moment it teeters on the edge surrounded by a blizzard of
glass then it is qone plunging backwards into the night and
all that is left is the ROAR of the city coming through the
broken window and the sound of glass and debris cascading to the
street thirty floors below

Mo relaxes slowly coming down

He lowers his shotgun as Chief and Vernon go running past him
looking for a fire extinguisher

He hears something move behind him and turns to see Jill standing
in the doorway staring at the window her face streaked with
tears He steps toward her reaching out to take her in his arms
but she pulls away

JILL
Where were you

She sits down on the end of the bed and begins to tear one of the
sheets into strips bandaging her arm

MO
Let me look at that

JILL
I can take care of it

Mo decides to remain ouiet He leans back against the wall by the
door He hears the HISSSS of fire extinguishers coming from the
hall Shades wanders past whistling through his teeth

SHADES
Mama-mia

He kneels next to Lincolns corpse shaking his head Then he
looks up at the broken window and the sky beyond He seems
mesmerized by the view He rises to a standing position Gazing
out

Chief turns off the fire alarm and ducks back into the room
CHIEF
Fires out Im going to call the cops and get
an ambulance

MO
I already had somebody call They should have
been here by now

CHIEF
There was a big riot downtown Probably have
their hands full Something about that new bill

Chief ducks back out

JILL
Figures

She stands broodingly

JILL
Why waste their time forcing birth control on
us Why not just send a few of those metal
fuckers into the streets

She looks at Mo He doesnt have an answer She joins Shades at
the window looking out

The smog has cleared and the stars are still bright over
rooftops the the sky a deep rich blue and on the far horizon
is the first glow of dawn

Jill watches the sky slowly change hue It is criss-crossed with
vapor trails

High up a supersonic jet is barrelling along on the edge of the
stratosphere heading someplace else

JILL
(softly)
I want out from here I want to get away

Shades looks at her Mo has crossed the room and is standing
behind her Shades looks at the floor steps away from them

MO
Its gonna be all right Things are gonna

change

She squeezes her eyes shut Dully
JILL
How much worse can they get

MO
I mean for the better

He puts a hand on her shoulder

MO
--11ll be here

She sighs raggedly She almost smiles Her voice is a hoarse
whisper

JILL
For how long

He looks out the window at the changing sky Then at the back of
her head

MO
From now on I’m gonna stay here with you
(beat)
If youll let me

Several seconds pass Then she turns to him a smile flickering
on her lips He gives her a cheeky smile in return He lets his
hand fall to his side

MO
Youll be safe with me Ill look after ya

She leans her head against his chest and they wrap their arms
tightly around each other

Shades walks out of the apartment muttering something inaudible
staring at the floor all the way

Suddenly Jill tightens up She slides her palms up to Mos chest
and draws back Looking him square in the eye Realizing
something
JILL
You never had to go back did you That was a
lie wasnt it Your contract is up

He doesnt answer His face is blank Then finally he starts to
shake his head and —-

-- a blackened steel hand reaches up through the window —-

and grabs her by the hair
Spinning her around to face the night
Mo starts forward with a CRY but he is only human and thus far
too slow

MO
NO

He catches a fleeting glimpse of a glistening metallic shape
clinging like a spider to the outside of the apartment block and
he raises his shotgun trying to take aim but Jills body is in
the way Then the android hauls her from his view pulling her
head-first through the broken window blood spattering around
her

He hears her SHRIEK and sees her legs kick for a moment before
the creature releases her and she falls away into the night

Mo raises the gun FIRING into the darkness glass tinkling all
around him his mouth stretched wide LAUGHING CRYING SCREAMING
FIRING again and again

EXT APARTMENT BLOCK - NIGHT

The power line breaks Jills fall

She lashes out with one hand grabbing onto the cable crying out
in pain her feet swinging in space She reaches up with her
other hand to grip the cable more firmly and then just hangs
there for awhile her head drooping

She feels blood running down her body and there is a dull pain in
her forehead

She realizes that shes been badly hurt but she cant get her
thoughts together much beyond that

She hears someone shouting in the distance and a sound like
thunder

Mos voice drifts back to her from earlier that evening trying
to explain something to her in his typical half-joking half-
serious manner his voice small and faint coming from a long way
off

MO
They tell you not to look down when you climb a
cliff but why not The view is beautiful

She smiles at his reassurance

She opens her eyes and looking down sees her bare feet dangling
below her streaked with blood crimson droplets falling away to
the street thirty floors below

She closes her eyes and SCREAMS
INT JILLS APARTMENT

Mos head is bowed hands clenched on the shotgun eyes tightly
shut when he hears her scream He lifts his head Cant believe
what hes hearing Leaps forward and leans out the broken window
his steel hand clutching the buckled frame

Jill is swinging from the power line only a few feet below him
her knuckles white

He starts to clamber through the broken glass stepping out onto a
narrow brick parapet the night wind murmuring about him
He calls her name and her eyelids flicker

MO
JILL

JILL
MO HELP ME IM SLIPPING

MO
I CANT YOURE HANGING ON A POWER LINE IF I
TOUCH YOU WELL BOTH FRY

JILL
HELP ME GOD

MO
YOUVE GOT TO TRY AND JUMP THERE’S NO OTHER
WAY

JILL

I CANT DO IT

Mo looks down and sees the startled faces of the downstairs
NEIGHBORS peering through the curtains of their living room
window immobile as waxworks

MO
THERESS A WINDOW JUST IN FRONT OF YOU YOUVE
GOT TO DO IT

JILL
I CAN’T DO IT

MO
YOU CAN

Then something moves just below the ledge and Mo goes pale There
is a SPUTTER of shorting wiring and Jill SCREAMS as she hears the
electric WHIR of the androids servo-motors The creature is
clinging to a fusebox just below the parapet drawing in energy
sparks seething like fireflies all around it

Mo levels the shotgun as the creature reaches out toward Jills
dangling body

MO
JILL SWING ITS COMING SWING FOR THE LOVE OF
CHRIST SWING AND JUMP

Jill starts trying to swing herself toward the window

The androids claw arcs through the air

She gathers momentum her kimono flapping around her in crimson
tatters

The metal claw is inches away and with an EXPLOSION of sparks the
power line snaps under the strain and Jill lets go in mid-swing
launching herself with a SCREAM toward the lighted window the
street yawning beneath her

INT JILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Earlier that evening
Jill falling backwards in the chair laughing Mo standing over
her

INT APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

The living room window BURSTS in a shower of glass and SCREAMING
Chinese people dive for cover as Jill comes crashing feet first
into their lives landing awkwardly on the coffee table upending
a bowl of stale cocktail snacks and coming to rest in a heap on
the floor one leg twisted under her blood trickling in a thin
stream from her nose and pooling on the carpet

Its very red against her pale skin

The severed power cable HISSES and SPARKS twisting beside her as
if alive

EXT LEDGE

Mo creeps along the parapet still holding onto the window frame
with one hand

He sees the android scrambling to pull itself back into the
apartment and he snarls at it striking it in the face with the
butt of his shotgun trying to break its grip on the ledge

MO
GO TO HELL YOU BASTARD

The creature looks up at him freezing him with its gaze Red
light glints in Mos eyes sweat beading on his forehead
He shivers trying to look away
The creature seems to be smiling at him now a great groovy
deaths head grin

Then it simply lets go of the parapet snaking one hand around
Mos ankle as it falls Mo YELLS losing his balance feeling the
window frame give beneath his weight the street lights spinning
far below him

INT STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Shades is already running on the stairs when he sees the door of
the apartment downstairs burst open and a distraught Chinese
couple come running out onto the landing screaming for help He
dashes down the flight pushing past them into the lighted
doorway

INT APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS

The Chinese woman screams something inarticulate at Shades
grasping at his sleeve and trying to hold him back He pushes her
away and manages to keep at arms length as he struggles down the
corridor into the lounge He shoves her away and crunches over
broken glass as he approaches Jill’s body

SHADES
Oh no

He bends and lifts her her away from the holding her gently in
his arms as he drags snaking power cable chanting a mantra under
his breath to try to make things all right

EXT LEDGE

Mo clenches his teeth his eyes bulging as he tries to haul
himself back into the apartment The electric motor in his hand
whines in protest frame on the verge of giving out completely
the window slowly buckling beneath the combined weight of both
him and the creature that dangles from his foot He wants to grab
the window frame with his other hand but cant bring himself to
let go of the shotgun

His hand slips slowly downwards about to give way
He closes his eyes

Mo SHOUTS his cry of rage going out over the rooftops He pulls
himself upwards muscles straining veins standing like cords in
his neck and arms

He hauls himself over the windowsill like a man doing a berserk
chin-up under an unfair burden flinging himself to carpet
landing on his shoulder and rolling the creature crawling fast
up his legs eyes blazing
A steel claw flashes through the air talons glinting in the
half-light and Mo reaches out to block the blow

He grasps the android by the wrist with his mechanical hand and
squeezes forcing the arm slowly back one of its control cables
snapping with a loud TWANG like a breaking guitar string

He brings up the shotgun with his other hand trying to level it
at the creature’s head but it is still too fast for him It
lunges foreward and he feels a sharp stinging pain as it bites
into his forearm

He releases his grip on the creatures hand slamming his knee
into its damaged chest driving it backwards

The creature regains its balance

Mo rams the shotgun against its head pulling the trigger on both
barrels

There is a flash of light and a deafening CONCUSSION and half the
creatures head disintegrates in a whirl of sparks one of the
lamp-like eyes snuffing out forever

It rolls SCREECHING and writhing across the floor clutching at
the remains of its head sparks rising from its exposed brain
pan its face a mess of exposed circuitry and trailing wires
Mo WHOOPS with delight reloading the shotgun The creature
crawls across the blackened carpet trying to hide behind the
computer terminal

MO
(chortling)
You can run

He stands to give chase but his wounded foot gives way beneath
him and he pitches to the floor He sits up feeling a dull pain
throbbing in his good hand He raises it and sees two small
needle marks in his forearm A drop of inky fluid oozes slowly
from one of the punctures and the veins in his arm are gradually
darkening his skin rising in blisters around the wound

MO
Oh my God

He looks up and it is as if the apartment is on fire again
psychedelic pinks and blues flickering across the walls He
thinks he sees the damaged android watching him its steel
fingers working on the wiring of the main computer terminal
plugging itself back into the main frame

Everything in the apartment seems to be coming to life now the
scrap sculptures writhing and whispering on the walls
ventilation tubes coiling like snakes across the ceiling and
melted babies twisting their heads to watch him with their dead
black eyes

He shakes his head wildly from side to side crying out trying
to hang on to his sanity

INT APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS - DAWN

Jill swims slowly back to consciousness a ring of faces peering
down at her Several Chinese PEOPLE are watching over her the
Chinese woman who lives there trying to feed her a bowl of soup
Several VAGRANTS and SQUATTERS crowd into the room lured by the
commotion

Chief comes pushing through them clutching a baseball bat and
as if dreaming Jill sees his lips move saying something his
voice impossibly slow

CHIEF
Get back The ambulance is here Were gonna
move her now

She feels something cool on her bending over her face and looking
up she sees Shades splashing water on her forehead

Then she tries to sit up suddenly frightened

JILL
MO

Shades tries to hold her down

SHADES
Its all right Just stay quiet now
Everythings gonna be all right
(beat)
Theres nothing you can do

She pushes him away sitting up realizing that shes been lying
wrapped in a blanket on a couch in the downstairs neighbors
lounge

Her eyes search the faces of the onlookers

JILL
MO WHERE ARE YOU

INT JILLS APARTMENT - LOUNGE - DAWN

Mo stretches out his steel hand drawing his boot knife
He clenches his teeth and plunges the knife into his forearm
Blood and black ichor gush from the wound and he BELLOWS with
pain

He raises his arm sucking desperately at it spitting out a
mouthful of warm bitter fluid

He feels his nervous system starting to shut down and he raises
the knife again He knows he has to cut deeper into the infected
veins but he cant seem to get it together He tries to call for
help but all he can emit is a thick syrupy grunt that goes
nowhere dying in his throat

The apartment is blazing now light streaming up from
everywhere He sees Jills wrought iron owl trying to tear itself
off the wall its steel wings fluttering with impossible life

He feels that hes drowning sinking down into a floor that has
suddenly taken on the consistency of warm mud

Far back in his mind someones trying to tell him something
Something important that hes forgotten

INT ROBOT BREAKERS WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Alvy hovering over the blueprints

ALVY
-were testing a bunch of them out on the dune
sea but there was a fuck up Seems there was
one structural defect An Achilles heel in the
insulation system

The dwarf points at one of the diagrams and Mo feels himself
falling forward lost in the spinning schematic that unfolds
before him and turns into a glowing computer-generated mandala
He realizes that he has lost consciousness and struggles to find
his way out of the maze and back to sanity Alvys face swims
before him grotesquely distorted emerging from a sea of
circuitry It points at him and grins

ALVY
e-in the insulation system

INT LOUNGE

Mo cries out his eyes snapping open the knife still clutched in
his hand

The android is sitting astride the main terminal now drawing
power out of its matrix slowly gaining strength once more

It raises its arms like the branches of a metal tree and somehow
it seems insanely beautiful

Like the Rig Veda Goddess Kali and the dance of death

He begins to laugh
Jills voice comes to him again whispering from another time
stream

JILL (VO)
Ooh Jesus God Hes beautiful

ALVY (VO)
It can kill you in seconds and even make you
enjoy it

JILL (VO)

What a monster

ALVY (VO)
--enjoy it

He looks into Mark 13s eyes and smiles finding comfort in the
red glow

He no longer fears it

In the end everything was perfect after all

INT APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS - DAWN

Jill struggles to her feet on the edge of panic now the
onlookers crowding in around her

JILL
MOSES

Chief steps forvard putting a hand on her shoulder trying to
calm her

CHIEF
Please Jill Listen to me You can’t --

She shoves him hard in the chest and he staggers back She
snatches the baseball bat from his hands and begins to push
through the crowd feeling something grafting inside her leg

JILL
IM COMING MO JUST HANG ON

INT LOUNGE
Mo no longer has the strength to laugh The knife wavers and
falls from his hand and he steps forward out of his body into

Jills waiting arms

MO
Fun huh
JILL
(ruffling his hair)
Dont go Moses Dont ever go away again

MO
Im not going anywhere

They kiss and the kiss goes on forever

Then hes back leaning against the wall on the floor his eyes
closed his head dropping slowly forward mouth slack heart beat
slowing

There is a sound a growing high-pitched WHINE It might be in
his head

He whispers but no one is there to hear him

MO
Im sorryJill

Then he is still Lifeless The only sound in the room is the
approaching metallic WHINE

The android is holding aloft Jills circular saw

It hunkers over Mos crumpled form the saw blade a whirling
blur

EXT STAIRWELL - DAWN

Jill struggles painfully up the steps clutching the baseball
bat the blanket tied around her like a cloak She turns to glare
down at the gathering mob threatening them with the bat to keep
them at bay as a red dawn breaks across the rooftops

Shades and the Chief stand at their forefront Shades holds out
his hands to her

SHADES
Okay Jill thats enough What do you think
youre going to do with that

She swings the bat at him

JILL
GET AWAY FROM ME

Shades leaps back with a YELP and Jill drags herself up onto the
landing in front of her apartment holding onto the railing for
support The door is open

Vernon is peering warily into the apartment squeezing his
automatic tightly in a sweaty grip He jumps startled as Jill
nears him
JILL
Get out of my way Vernon

VERNON
You dont want to go in there Miss Monroe

JILL
I SAID GET OUT OF MY WAY GODDAMNIT

VERNON
Its still in there

JILL
SO IS MO

Vernon glances over her shoulder Jill spins around to find the
Chief coming up to grab her She swings the bat at his head
YELLING at the top of her lungs

Chief takes a step back startled more by her shriek than the
bat

Jill turns and makes a dash for the open door wincing at the
pain in her leg

Vernon starts forward and she swings the bat at him clipping him
in the side of the head with a hollow THOK He reels back dazed

She limps quickly across the threshold into the darkened
apartment

Behind her the Chief and Vernon are yelling at each other but she
doesnt look back

INT JILLS APARTMENT

Jill staggers across the burned-out hallway heading for the
lounge her own head throbbing filled with fire She reels
drunkenly leaning on the bat for support

She knows shes nearing the limit of her strength but theres
something she has to do

Behind her Vernon starts across the threshold Chief and Shades
right behind him

INT LOUNGE
The android is still plugged into the main terminal It senses

the movement in the hall and reaches out fingers darting across
the keyboard the exposed matrix of its brain glowing with light
INT HALLWAY

There is a HISS of hydraulics and the apartment door slides home
on its runners its control circuits sparking close to overload
Chief sees the door closing and makes a dive for it

He doesnt make it

The door catches him just above the hips squeezing him against
the frame driving the wind out of him his body armor CRUMPLING
The hydraulics SQUEAL The door automatically reopens

Chief gasps trying to get up but there seems to be something
wrong with his legs

Shades grabs him by the feet trying to pull him back across the
threshold

Vernon turns too slow his gaze meeting Chiefs for a moment
Chiefs eyes are wide with fear

INT LOUNGE
The android hits the keyboard again overloading the system
INT HALLWAY

The door RAMS home on its pistons and the Chiefs body unhinges
at the waist

His arms twitch his mouth wide open vomiting a dark jet of
blood so thick its almost solid

Shades staggers back against the railing still clutching Chiefs
legs

Vernon falls to his knees and throws up on the carpet

Jill looks away sobbing staggering into the lounge the
baseball bat raised in front of her

Behind her the door begins to slice open and closed over and
over the runners greased with blood sparks showering from the

control console

INT LOUNGE - DAWN

Jill slowly crosses the room glancing warily about Then she
sees Mo and starts forward with a gasp kneeling beside him
momentarily forgetting her own peril She touches him and his
head tips slackly to one side Behind the half-closed lids his
eyes are dull as marbles Jill shivers a sob rising inside her

JILL
Oh MoMo Why couldnt you wait for me

She reaches out softly touching his face straightening his
hair leaning forward as if to kiss him
JILL
I love you

She notices that she’s kneeling in a pool of blood that has
spread beneath him

His left arm is folded under his torso

She turns him over

His robot prosthetic hand is missing severed from his wrist
Dark fluid drools from the stump

Jill recoils with a gasp staggering to her feet

She turns brandishing the baseball bat screaming minding
tilting slowly into madness

JILL
GOD DAMN You

But the android is already gone from behind the console She can
see no sign of it but knows it must be somewhere close

She hears a stealthy movement behind her and spins around in a
black rage

Vernon is standing in the doorway pale with shock automatic
clutched in his trembling hands

VERNON
What are we gonna do now We cant get out
WHAT ARE WE GONNA FUCKING DO

JILL
(raising the bat)
SHUT UP You want me to hit you with this
again

Vernon vehemently shakes his head

JILL
Then just shut the fuck up

VERNON
(sobbing)
Butbutits gonna kill us It got the
Chief You cant stop it Were gonna die

She turns slowly scanning for the creature nodding

JILL
Yeah eventually Not today

VERNON
Youpromise
JILL
(nodding)
Cross my heart and you know the rest

She hobbles over to the computer terminal Vernon steps warily
into the room his eyes searching the wreckage He sees a dark
stain on the floor and stares at it A drop of hydraulic fluid
hits him on the cheek and he glances up at the ceiling

Mark 13 grins down at him hanging from the light fixture one
hand plugged into the power socket

Vernon has just enough to time to let out a strangled yell before
the creature grabs him by the face and lifts him off the floor

His automatic falls to the carpet discharging a single shot

JILL
NO NO NO

Vernons feet shudder in mid-air and then begin to smoke as
current surges through him

Jill covers her eyes as the creature flings the security guard
against the wall like a big broken doll and jumps eagerly down
after him

Through her fingers she sees Mark 13 scuttle over to the wall
console that used to control the lighting and stereo system and
plug one hand into the power matrix

It shudders orgasmically drawing more energy into its storage
battery and beginning to carve up Vernons twitching body with
its drill arm

JILL
WHY DONT YOU COME AFTER ME YOU LITTLE POWER
JUNKIE YOU SCARED

The android glances back at her over its shoulder as if caught in
the midst of a sexual act

It shifts uneasily dragging Vernons body deeper into the
shadows as if embarrassed

Then something occurs to Jill

She bends over the computer terminal frantically tyoing a series
of digits into the keyboard

A complex map of the apartments power grid flashes across the
terminals visual display

She grins pinpointing the android and typing in another command

The androids brain matrix appears on the screen and she looks up
to see that the creature has turned once again and is watching
her with its single baleful eye
(PAGE MISSING)

JILL
You have been programmed incorrectly I am not
the enemy and this is not the zone I am an
unemployed scrap sculptress and this is a
residential building

The android seems to be thinking Then
JILL
You need to be reprogrammed What is your memory

bank access code

MARK 13
Access code classified

JILL
How does your brain work Tell me about your
design

MARK 13
Oh

We all walk the wibberlee wobberlee WALK
And we all talk the wibberlee wobberlee TALK
And we all wear wibberlee wobberlee TIES

And we look at all the pretty girls with
wibberlee wobberlee EYES

Oh

In a blur the android disengages itself from the wall console and
comes CLATTERING across the room at her

She swings the bat STRIKING it hard in the head

Sparks shoot from its exposed brain and it stumbles back a step
as Jill retreats toward the door

It comes at her again and she swings the bat once more YELLING

as the impact shivers up her arm

She stumbles into the hallway whirling the bat around her in an
attempt to keep the android at bay

She turns catching a glimpse of Shades watching helplessly from
the other side of the malfunctioning door

Her guard falters for a second

SHADES
JILL WATCH OUT

She spins around and the android is almost upon her

She YELLS an animal cry of rage BATTERING crazily at the
android’s head and exposed brain keeping it at bay as she backs
down the hall
She braces herself against the bathroom door making a stand as
the android comes at her again

She lashes out but the android deflects the blow and she loses
her grip on the bat sending it CRASHING through the glass shower
partition

One of Mark 13s claws catches her on the jaw and she reels
backwards landing awkwardly on the tile floor of the shower
cubicle the cut in her scalp reopening blood trickling down her
forehead into her eyes

Her hand fumbles blindly across the broken glass reaching for
the handle of the baseball bat

Mark 13 comes at her fast now talons SCRATCHING across the wet
tiling pinning her down with its newly-acquired prosthetic hand
The red warning light on the back of the other hand blinks to
life

She SCREAMS

A severed power cable SPUTTERS in the creatures damaged chest
but nothing happens Jill realizes why the android had to plug
itself into the power socket before electrocuting Vernon

Mark 13s drill arm WHIRS to life telescoping out toward her
about to finish something it started once before Jill SCREAMS
her head twisting from side to side her legs thrashing her
hands clawing in vain at the androids armored breastplate

EXT STAIRWAY — DAWN

Shades watches miserably through the swiftly opening-and-closing
door Breathing in and out through his nose Mouth shut tight He
closes his eyes at the sound of another SCREAM

EXT STAIRWELL - DAY

Earlier that day
Mo turned to Shades on the stairs Looking at him seriously

MO
--When Im not around See nothing happens to
her okay Promise me that

EXT STAIRWAY - DAWN

Shades opening his eyes and mouth Drawing a long breath
Stepping back Watching the door SLAM open and closed

Counting under his breath

Closing his eyes again

Humming softly to himself

Trying to match the tone of the electrical pulses that power the
door
He opens his eyes and jumps sailing across the threshold with a
tremendous leap that would have made a samurai warrior proud

INT HALLWAY

Shades stumbles over Chiefs torso and sprawls on the charred
floor as the door SLAMS shut behind him with lethal force He
sits up staring at the door in disbelief

Then he hears Jill SCREAM again and he starts to his feet
prising the automatic from Chiefs grip and heading toward the
bathroom

INT SHOWER - DAY

Jills fingers fasten on the baseball bat

Grasping if with both hands she SLAMS it into the androids
throat

It backs off an inch and she struggles violently to squirm out of
its grasp

The drill spins only inches awav from her flesh

Its mouth snaps at her hvpodermic teeth dripping venom

Its claws tangle in her blanket and the fabric TEARS loudly as
she pulls away

She kicks the android in the chest breaking one of her toes and
hurtling backwards pulling right out of the blanket

The blanket is still warm and for a moment the android is plainly
confused The drill bites into empty cloth and Jill inches away
The android looks up clutching the rags

Knows it’s been tricked

Then Shades is suddenly in the doorway leveling the Chiefs
automatic at the androids head

The gun jumps in his hand and the bullet WHINES off the
creatures armor plating RICOCHETING around the cubicle in a
spray of glass

Jill SCREAMS and ducks and the android turns to Shades looking
at him as if he were no more a distraction than a fly Shades
stares back red light glinting in his dark glasses It is as if
he hears a countdown for a lift-off echoing in his mind

The android tenses preparing to spring
Shades levels the gun again finger tightening on the trigger

Jill tries to regain her footing but her leg no longer seems to
respond

She reaches for something to grab hold of Her hand falls on the
hot water tap She tries to lift herself The tap just spins
under her weight and all she manages to do is turn on the shower
Steaming water sprays from the shower head and the androids heat
sensors go crazy

Jill backs off inching away as the creature runs amok arms
flailing in all directions clawing at the falling water and
trying to grab hold of the steam the shower partition
disintegrating around it in a cloud of pulverized glass

To Mark 13 the water is a stream of golden light

There is light everywhere now even covering its chassis and it
reaches out toward the source of the light a coruscating sun-
like object on the cubicle wall

It reaches toward the shower head

It feels the light slowly seeping into its body Seeping into its
mind Setting its mind on fire

It begins to understand

Hot water sprays across its eyes driven in rivulets across its
metal chassis

Jill sees a flurry of sparks begin to rise from its exposed
brain

The android emits a deafening high-pitched mechanical SCREECH as
it shorts out its arms pinwheeling out of control

The prosthetic hand is tearing at the androids own wiring

Jill suddenly understands and turns both faucets on full

The android writhes beneath the gently spray a haze of smoke
filling the air It falls on its back twitching spastically
arms a blur of motion glass scattering all over

Its brain matrix burns out in a burst of blue sparks and then at
last it lies still

The sharp electric smell of burning insulation hangs heavily in
the air

Shades takes a step forward lowering the gun staring at the
deactivated android in disbelief

SHADES
Jesus

The smoke thins affording them a clear view of Mark 13s
motionless carcass lying sprawled on its back in a shallow
puddle The spray rings lightly on its chassis dripping across
its mangled face pooling in its one remaining eye socket
leaking deeply into its lifeless circuits

With a CRY of rage Jill somehow gets to her feet and starts
forward dancing naked over its body BEATING at its head with
the baseball bat SCREAMING and SCREAMING the blood running off
her in pink rivulets
She beats at it until its head is nothing but a tangle of twisted
microchips and the bat splinters in her blistered hands

Shades puts a hand on her shoulder and she turns with a snarl
threatening him with the remains of the bat He holds his hands
up to her

SHADES
Jill Listen to me Listen Its over You
killed it Its dead Look

He kicks the android It makes a hollow PLONK

SHADES
(seriously)
Its not going to get up It’s finished Okay

Jill stands beneath the hot spray rubbing her eyes and at last
unnoticed she lets the tears come joining the rivulets of warm
water already running down her body

Shades takes off his flight jacket and drapes it around her
shoulders Jill drops the remains of the bat and lets him lead
her from the cubicle

DISSOLVE TO
INT LOUNGE - DAY

The rising wail of police sirens

The clock radio flicks to 600 AM

A cheesy electronic JINGLE heralds the new broadcast day The
deejay addresses the devastated lounge a pulsebeat of heavy
metal in the background
