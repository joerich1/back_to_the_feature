INT A DARK PLACE NIGHT

A man on fire his face and hair aflame He stares at you
accusation in his eyes You raise a hand to keep him away
The hand bursts into flame It is a torch skin blistering
The burning man screams You are inside a tank M1Al1 Abrams
The instruments glow green Another man on fire scrambles
from the hatch The fire traces a lazy line across the
bulkhead It is headed to the ammunition stacks The man
screams at you again The fire leaps upon the magazine of

20mm shells It dances there a few seconds The man is
upon you - burning before your eyes The scream is
intelligible for the first time I DONT WANT TO DIE

INT BAR DAY

The flames become amber fluid in glass

COLONEL NATHANIAL NAT SERLING looks at the glass at his
watch finishes the drink leaves

EXT BAR DAY

Serling crosses the street pouring half a box of Tic-Tacs
into his mouth eating them like candy

He heads toward one of those anonymous buildings in Suitland
outside Washington DC Serling is in his 40s born to the
uniform but there is something sad in his eyes defeated in
his walk

He enters the building

INT HALLWAY DAY

The sign on a door says US Army - Awards and Decorations
Branch Serling enters

INT COLONEL LEVINES OFFICE DAY

COLONEL PHILLIP LEVINE a little martinet a bureaucratic
Hitler

Serling sits across from the desk from Levine The desk is
immaculate everything arranged with a ruler and a T-square
Nameplate with pens up front

LEVINE
I remember you I was there in
Desert Storm 24th Mech

Serling nods grimly Hes been through this before Levine
wont let it alone

LEVINE
Frankly Im surprised youre still
in the service

SERLING
So am I

The answer doesnt give Levine any satisfaction
LEVINE

I dont agree with this assignment
Im sure the General has his own

reasons

SERLING
Im sure Could I look at the
file

The file sits alone on that splendid desk - centered

LEVINE
Im not required to release the
documentation until I receive all
of the proper forms and orders

He smiles What a paper-pushing asshole Serling smiles
ruefully

LEVINE
Something funny Colonel

SERLING
Just petty little men like you who
dont have power but pounce on any
semblance of it like a crow on a
road kill

Levine clenches his jaw Hes about to reply or spit The
door opens GENERAL HERSHBERG enters

The two Colonels stand at attention until the General nods
then down He slides his butt onto Levines desk sweeping
the nameplate to the corner Levine has a shitfit but
swallows it

GEN HERSHBERG
How are you doing Nat
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 3

SERLING
I have an In box and an Out I
empty one and fill the other I
even have a rubber stamp with my
name on it so I dont get writers
cramp Its heaven

Hershberg picks up the file glances at the label and tosses
it to Serling Levine is about to protest but a look from
the General cuts it off at the knees

GEN HERSHBERG
This is a little hot potato and in
that weird form of Washington
alchemy it could turn into a
political football Captain Karen
Emma Walden first woman to be
eligible for the Medal of Honor

LEVINE
In combat

GEN HERSHBERG
In combat First we got all the
stink about women in combat There
are some who will be sniping at
this just because of that Then
there are those that are going to
line up and say were only doing
this to overcompensate or distract
the public from the charges of
sexism and sexual harassment in
the services

LEVINE
Bullshit

Hershberg looks at Levine like he was a cockroach on a cake

GEN HERSHBERG
There are only two things you have
to worry about Nat The President
wants this I want this His
reasons As usual I havent
a clue I want it because I think
she deserves it Put it under a
microscope With your usual
thoroughness Nat Any problems
call my Adjutant Captain Banachek
or even me No slacking This is
important Nat To the nation To
the Army To me Lets go

He rises Levine pops up

LEVINE
Sir I cant let that file leave
this office I havent received

my 2930 or the 264

GEN HERSHBERG
Colonel theres nothing I detest
more than little DC hamsters who
cant see beyond the paper at the
bottom of their little cages

He leads Serling out closes the door behind him Levine is
left to straighten his desk

EXT BUILDING DAY

The Generals car waits outside Hershberg and Serling exit
go to the car Hershberg looks up at the building

GEN HERSHBERG

Thats whats killing this country
Not crime or pollution My daddy
used to tell me -- look close at
the word bureaucrat Theres always
a rat in it

(beat )
Do this right Nat and you can
broom your rubber stamps

SERLING
Yes sir

GEN HERSHBERG
Captain Banachek has a list of the
eyewitnesses and their current
postings Need a ride

SERLING
No sir I drove my own car

GEN HERSHBERG
Well dont blow through a stop
sign That breath will lose you
your license

Serling is embarrassed He salutes Hershberg salutes back
and gets into the car unwinds the window

GEN HERSHBERG
Do this right Nat Captain Karen
Walden deserves it And you need
it

And he signals to the driver and is gone
Serling looks at the file walks to his car stops He makes

a right turn crosses the street enters a bar

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET DAY

A big house and a big yard
with a refrigerator box
of creating a house or a fort

There are five kids in the yard
They are arguing over the benefits
A lot of yelling laughing

and running back and forth to the house for scissors fat
felt pens and a hacksaw blade to cut the windows or gun ports
(still under heated discussion)

Serling watches from his

car parked across the street

A woman comes out of the house She is handsome some of
the kids look like her Her name is MEREDITH

a steaming cup of coffee

the street to Serling

She leans

MEREDITH
Just made a fresh pot I put some
cocoa in it for you

SERLING
Thanks You got a new fridge

MEREDITH
Yes The noise it used to make at
three in the morning That horrible
rattle and moan Didnt make it
night before last

comfortably against the car

MEREDITH

Got up to find a big puddle on the
kitchen floor and had to throw
away a whole chicken This ones
more efficient and has an ice maker
in the door

(beat )
You cant do this anymore It
scares the kids

Serling notices the children glancing his way

MEREDITH
They dont understand why their
daddy chose to move out and leave
them Neither do I

She carries

and walks in a straight path across

SERLING
You dont I explained it to you
I have to work out this thing
MEREDITH

I hear what you say That doesnt
mean I understand it But the
kids They think its their fault
Dont do this to them anymore

SERLING
I Im leaving town for a days
Hershbergs got me taking a Medal
of Honor and wrapping it up ina
shiny wrapper

MEREDITH
Medal of Honor

SERLING
A woman

MEREDITH
Good for her

SERLING
Posthumous

MEREDITH
Too bad

But still good for her And about time How long you going
to be gone

SERLING
A week Ten days

MEREDITH
When you get back we have to deal
with this One way or another

She makes it sound very ominous Serling makes light Smiles

SERLING
Sounds like an ultimatum

She doesnt smile at all

MEREDITH
It is I dont want you haunting
us like this Either you come
through that front door -- to stay --
or you dont come back here at
all That was hard to say
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 7

And she walks back to the house trying to hold onto her
composure tears he cant see in her eyes But Serling can
feel them He knows her that well

He holds the cup up to her It is empty
The front door slams shut

Serling drives away All five kids stop and watch him go

INT PLANE NIGHT

It is dark in the plane Most overhead lights out most
passengers sleeping

One light is on -- Serlings He is in civilian clothes
There is a collection of little bottles on Serlings tray
all empty

He is reading Waldens file There are tears in his eyes
The stewardess comes by and sees the tears Serling
embarrassed turns off the overhead light and turns his face
to the window He can see his own reflection A man in
pain Deep soul-cutting pain He pulls down the shade

EXT FORT BRAGG DAY
Fort Bragg North Carolina Home of the 82nd Airborne

Serling in uniform walks into one of those one-story wooden
barracks left over from WWII

INT BARRACKS DAY

A classroom Horrible photos of the results of bad dental
hygiene an illustration of proper brushing Serling turns
the disgusting photos to face the wall The room is filling
up with eleven men all talking excitedly It is a reunion

of sorts Hugs unashamed tears and endless talk What

have you been doing Going to meet with us after Youre
getting fat man

A man in civilian clothes enters and is instantly surrounded
by the others Where you been Hows civilian life
How are the legs

He pulls up his pant legs to reveal two artificial limbs
That brings a round of scar comparison as clothing is peeled
away or dropped to reveal the shiny tissue War wounds

Serling watches -- an outsider

FIRST LIEUTENANT CHELLI counts heads and goes up to Serling

LT CHELLI
All present and accounted for
sir

Serling faces the men as they settle into their seats

SERLING
Im trying to confirm the sequence
of events that occurred at or around
Al Kufan on 26 February 1991 How
did you men come to be on the
Blackhawk designated Dust Off Two
piloted by Warrant officer Fowler
Was it a combat Medevac

LT CHELLI
No Sir

Traffic accident

EGAN
Damn Saudi drivers sir Thought
they were driving cabs in New York

THOMPSON
Most of them are

LT CHELLI
Wed have a convoy of thirty trucks
or more and theyd decide to pass

EGAN
And another Kamikazi Saudi would
be coming the other way

THOMPSON
They couldnt go to the shoulder --
minefields Theyd

LT CHELLI
We were heading along the north
end of Iraq to set up a fueling
depot for the 24th part of
Schwartzkopfs Hail Mary Some
mad Saudi in a deuce-and-a-half
goes to pass the convoy and suddenly
theres another convoy coming the
other way
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 9

EXT ROAD DAY

A long column of trucks roll down a narrow road Smoke from
Kuwait wafts over the endless sand In the back of one five-
ton truck 2nd Lt Chelli and his men plus ten more sit
bored smoking and joking

A Saudi driver in a big pale blue piece of shit truck thunders
down the road passing the Army convoy oblivious to the
danger bouncing his head to some Paul Revere and the Raiders
music Then he sees the other convoy He looks for a gap

in the traffic alongside of him None He slams on the
brakes The truck goes into a skid It fishtails ramming
Chellis truck The trucks hurtle off the road Both hit
mines on the shoulder The Saudi truck blows up The big
five-ton flips onto its side and skids for yards plowing up
sand Another mine goes off The truck stops The
passengers litter the sand wounded -- moaning screaming
bleeding or very still

INT BARRACKS DAY
LT CHELLI

We had fifteen injured Mostly
broken bones contusions

EGAN
A few burns The Saudi truck blew
up

JENKINS

Mines were going off like popcorn
but no shrapnel wounds

THOMPSON
The Saudi truck burned The driver
was a crispy critter

EGAN
His cargo was all over the road
Pampers and shower shoes -- flip

flops you know

JENKINS
Here we are running around scared
shitless of poison gas and Scuds
and the damn Republican Guard and
we get taken out by some Saudi
speed merchant with a truck load
of flip flops

LT CHELLI
The Medevac Warrant officer
Fowlers bird picked us up and
headed south to some MASH unit
Nothing happened on the trip It
was pretty routine

EGAN
Until we were shot down

That statement takes the wind out of everybody

INT BLACKHAWK DAY

The Blackhawk flies low along the east side of the Euphrates
River Mountains on both sides Inside are Lt Chelli and
his men bandaged and bloodied but conscious

SERLING (VO)
Altitude

LT CHELLI (VO)
Low fifty to a hundred feet off
the floor

The chopper shudders A huge impact Then it begins to
fall Shouting screaming The chopper hits the ground
hard The impact splays the skids Men fall out the doors

INT BARRACKS DAY

SERLING
Do you know what brought you down

LT CHELLI
No Triple A a missile TOW
Couldnt tell One moment we were
up -- the next we were eating sand

SERLING
When did you see the enemy

LT CHELLI
Egan thought he saw some enemy
movement before we got hit

EGAN
Just some figures below Could
have been Bedouins hard to tell

JENKINS
I thought I saw a flash
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

SERLING
Firearms

JENKINS
Small arms Maybe

LT CHELLI
I didnt see anything

SERLING
The pilot and co-pilot were killed
on impact

LT CHELLI
Yes The medic Balkum Balkum
confirmed this The Blackhawk
nosed into the mountain The Medic
and Crew Chief started giving aid
to the new injuries We lost two
immediately Feretic and Brady
Another Rizza died a few minutes
later My Platoon Sergeant

EGAN
The Crew Chief tried to get out an
SOS The pilot didnt have time
He wasnt able to raise anyone
the radio was wasted in the crash

SERLING
How long before you saw the enemy

LT CHELLI
About an hour - a little more
Ground troops They came over the
ridge to the northwest of us
They fired on us

EGAN
All we had was the Crew Chiefs M-
16 and four nine mills the chopper
crews side arms

LT CHELLI
They stripped us of our weapons on
the Medevac Procedure The Crew
Chief returned fire with his 16
We were downslope

EGAN
Sitting ducks

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

JENKINS
But the Crew Chief kept the enemy
to the ridge Until 1600 hours
-- around there

SERLING
When he was hit
LT CHELLI
Yes He was on his last magazine

The nine mills didnt have the
range Rounds fell short

SERLING
Any of the enemy fire prove to be
effective

LT CHELLI

Monaco took two in the chest He
died during the night Lem Fistch
were wounded Cherensky no he

was later

EGAN
And you sir
LT CHELLI
Yes I took a round in the leg

And the medic had a bullet part
his hair A lot of blood but he
was still working

JENKINS
The chopper provided us no cover
Bullets went through it like
cardboard

LT CHELLI
We were in a world of hurt sir

SERLING
Did you discuss surrendering

Lt Chelli looks at the others

LT CHELLI
Yes sir We were all wounded in
one way or another It was

discussed But we figured wed
hold em off as long as possible

in case a rescue came It was a

Gifficult and protracted debate
sir
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 13

SERLING
I suspect so

EGAN
We werent trained for that kinda
shit

THOMPSON

Then the tank appeared

INT BLACKHAWK DAY

The men in the crashed chopper are in rough shape Battered
bloody the dead covered with a poncho that flaps in the
wind

SWOCK Gunfire and another hole in the fuselage The body
of the chopper looks like Swiss cheese

EGAN (V0)
Wed been there a few hours Our
shit was pretty flaky by then

The Medic head bandaged returns fire sparingly Then a
noise Everyone listens even the most gravely wounded

They all try to see Over the river up the slope and across
the ridge The sound comes from there And over the crest
of the ridge appears a tank A Russian T-55 It pauses at
the ridge Then with a clatter and roar comes up over the
ridge and to the down slope It stops Then the turret
swivels Until the gun-points at the helicopter

THOMPSON (VO)

Its a very strange feeling to be
sitting there and watch a big gun
like that make adjustments to blow
you away

And the gun does that with whirrs and cranks A little
elevation A little windage Then BOOM The gun fires
The tank jerks back The tail section of the helicopter
disintegrates There is a huge cloud of dust in front of
the tank thrown up by the concussion With little wind it
just hangs there dissipating slowly

JR CHELLI (VO)

All we could do was wait until the
dust settled so they could see to
adjust Thats when as ranking
officer I made my decision
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 14

The Lieutenant steps out of the helicopter waving his white
handkerchief He takes a couple of steps toward the tank

LT CHELLI (VO)
I figured wed held out as long as
we could and that the lives of the
men on board

SERLING (VO)
You dont have to make excuses for
your actions to me Lieutenant

LT CHELLI (VO)
I know sir I know Its just
Well it didnt make any difference

The cloud of dust finally settles in front of the tank
They can see Chelli and the white flag of surrender And
the tank machine gun cuts loose The Lieutenant is hit in
his good leg He goes down

Two men wounded themselves run and haul him back to the
chopper The tanks big gun begins to move again in small
increments

EGAN (V0)
We were just target practice for
their big gun

THOMPSON (VO)
A turkey shoot

It fires BOOM This one misses - too far off the nose of
the chopper

LT CHELLI (VO)
Now they had us bracketed All
they had to do was adjust for
somewhere in the middle and we
were dead meat

The Medic fires at the tank with the M-16 The rounds just
bounce off Lt Chelli stops him and looks up at the sky

LT CHELLI (VO)
And then we heard it

THOMPSON (VO)
Theres something about an inbound
Huey

And suddenly up the river comes an American Huey helicopter
The unmistakable red cross of Medevac on its side
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 15

It buzzes by the downed Blackhawk and tank then does a steep
U-turn and comes back

SERLING (VO)
Did it take any ground fire

EGAN (VO)
Right off the bat

JENKINS (VO)
Instantly every rag head ground
pounder wanted a piece of that
bird

The enemy troops fire at the chopper but the only real
indication are the tracers arcing through the sky

LT CHELLI (VO)
When the Huey cans back this time
it returned fire Someone with a

EGAN (VO)
That Monfriez guy

LT CHELLI (VO)
We didnt know at the time but
yes SP5 Monfriez The ground
troops went for cover

The men in the Blackhawk cheer Elation takes them past the
pain of their wounds

BOOM The tank fires again The men in the Blackhawk are
blown to bits

LT CHELLI (VO)
That round killed the Medic Raleno
Cerspach Egan lost his legs

Chaos Men dying bleeding screaming - praying

LT CHELLI (VO)
We tended the wounded as best we
could

THOMPSON (VO)
And waited for the next round to
hit

SERLING (VO)
What was the Huey doing at this
time
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

EGAN (V0)
It circled back to go over the
tank again

JENKINS (VO)
Then they threw something overboard
at the tank

The Huey banks and over the tank a dark square object
plummets out the open door and lands a few yards away The
Huey bucks and turns One of the wounded men directs the
Lieutenants attention to the chopper

The tank is drenched in gas

SERLING (VO)
Threw or it fell off

LT CHELLI (VO)
Couldnt tell the first time But
the chopper banked and we could
see the Crew Chief unstrapping
something from the other side

EGAN
The fuel pod He was unhooking it
I knew I used to work choppers at
Fort Campbell

LT CHELLI (VO)
They were still taking ground fire
We could see where the tanks big
machine gun was making hits But
the Huey banked again and this
time the fuel pod hit

EGAN
Dead hit It burst like a water
balloon

THOMPSON (VO)
JP8 - air fuel all over the tank

LT CHELLI (VO)
Then someone in the Huey fired a
flare at the tank And it blew

The tank commander sitting

half in half out of the turret is yelling commands when he
realizes what is going on

He tries to bail Too late The tank erupts in flames
The ground troops run away from the burning tank

KA-BOOM

explosion and another

Something goes off inside the tank

Then another

The ammo inside cooks and blows
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 17

The tank disintegrates Inside the crashed Blackhawk the
men cheer

INT BARRACKS DAY

The men relive that moment with smiles and laughs

SERLING
Did you see what knocked the Huey
down
The mood darkens
LT CHELLI

No

EXT RIVER DAY
Inside the Blackhawk the mood darkens as they see the Huey

LT CHELLI (VO)
We were yelling and screaming so
much we didnt notice the Huey was
even hit

JENKINS (VO)
We just saw it spiral down and
crash

EGAN (VO)
It landed between the tank and us
on a little piece of high ground

SERLING (VO)
How far away

LT CHELLI (VO)
Five hundred meters

The Huey loses altitude fast the tail rotor dead It
crashes

THOMPSON (VO)
She hit hard

JENKINS (VO)
Real hard Surprised anyone
survived

It takes a lot of time for the dust to settle
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

SERLING (VO)
Did the Huey at any time climb to
an altitude to radio in a position

INT BARRACKS DAY
LT CHELLI

They didnt have a chance They
were taking fire all the time

SERLING
They could have climbed to escape
the fire

THOMPSON

Roger that sir and left us to

take the flak As long as they

were firing at the Huey they werent
shooting at us

SERLING
The sun set shortly after the Huey
crashed Was there any more ground
fire

LT CHELLI
The tank was incapacitated -- but
we caught sporadic ground fire
through the night The Huey took
most of it It was between us and
the enemy so

SERLING
You had no communications with the
Huey

LT CHELLI

No As I said our radio was wasted
We tried shouting at it but that
just drew enemy fire so we

stopped
SERLING

So you spent the night waiting
JENKINS

Longest night I ever spent
LT CHELLI

Monaco died during the night It

was cold

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

LT CHELLI (CONTD)
But We heard voices from the
Huey a couple of times small arms
fire between it and the ridge

SERLING
Could you see into the Huey Were
you able to discern what was
happening there

LT CHELLI
No Some rocks hid the interior
We couldnt see anything in daylight
and most of our time there it was
dark

SERLING
And with dawn came a new attack

LT CHELLI

Not quite The sun came up We
were pretty ragged by then

EXT BLACKHAWK MORNING

The sun comes up Lt Chelli weary to the bone and a few
men look up at the sky at the ridge On the ridge -- enemy

activity heads popping up guns laid on the ridge

LTCHELLI (VO)
On the ridge we saw forty maybe
fifty enemy They began firing at
the Huey mainly and moving toward
it under the cover fire The Huey
returned fire

THOMPSON (VO)
240 and M-16 maybe Beretta

EGAN (V 0)
Then we heard the rescue team
coming

JENKINS (VO)
A Huey A Blackhawk and a pair of
Cobras

THOMPSON (VO)
And a big ass F-14 Tomcat You
never heard such a beautiful noise
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 20

The aircraft zoom overhead Awesome beautiful sights The
men on the downed Blackhawk cheer with what little strength
they have

The Cobras strafe the ridge line The Blackhawk and Huey
land between the two downed aircraft

The wounded are loaded into the Blackhawk Three men run
out of the crashed Huey and into the new one

There is gunfire everywhere

LT CHELLI (VO)
All the wounded were loaded aboard
The dead were left behind We
were taking fire at the time One
of the Blackhawk medics was hit I
think

SERLING (VO)
Again Im not criticizing
Lieutenant but why were the dead
left behind

LT CHELLI (VO)
When we got aboard the Blackhawk
that was when we saw the enemy on
the other ridge Theyd flanked
us in the night It was a hot LZ
all right The decision was made
to leave the dead By the commander
of the rescue I think

The wounded are loaded onto the Blackhawk and then both it
and the Huey rise

LT CHELLI (VO)
The last thing we saw was the Tomcat
drop white phosphorus on the two
crashed choppers

An awesome display of burning white fire explodes the two
choppers

LT CHELLI (VO)
Then we were out of there

The rescue choppers back away

THOMPSON
Thank the Lord

There are

LT CHELLI
Colonel this isnt just some
Lessons Learned or post-action
analysis is it

SERLING
No Captain Walden has been
recommended for the Medal of Honor

LT CHELLI
Well I dont know if it was Captain
Walden or whoever -- but that Huey

and her crew saved our lives

THOMPSON
I wouldnt be here today I know
that

EGAN

We all thought we were dead

JENKINS
That Huey could have climbed and
just radioed in a location

LT CHELLI
And by the time someone would have
gotten to us we would have been
dead

THOMPSON
The Medal of Honor is not enough
for what they did

EGAN
They ought to give it to every
soldier on that Huey

sounds of affirmation from the rest of the men
SERLING

Thanks for your help gentlemen
Youre excused

They all rise and go back to conversing among themselves
making plans for the reunion dinner that night Serling

heads for

the door Lieutenant Chelli stops him

LT CHELLI
Sir You have a minute Colonel

SERLING
Sure Lieutenant

LT CHELLI
Sir you had a remarkable career --
before the incident at Al Bathra
I was wondering if perhaps you
could give me a few hints in
reference to getting on the fast
track like you

Lt Chelli carries a large manila envelope and worries it
between his fingers

SERLING
I wouldnt really know how to advise
you on

LT CHELLI

I mean they say sir that if it
hadnt been for the incident at Al
Bathra youd be a General now

Im a full-tilt career ring-knocker
sir and I plan on being the
youngest General in Army history

SERLING
Well I dont know about any Army
fast track Lieutenant I know

its hard work and a little luck

LT CHELLI
Sure sure Well if I can find me
a Rabbi like you got in General
Hershberg

SERLING
General Hershberg and I never met
before Desert Storm Id hardly
call him my Rabbi

LT CHELLI
But youre on his staff He saved
you from a Court Martial

LT CHELLI
Sir I forgot I wanted to give
you this

He hands Serling the envelope

LT CHELLI
Its an article I wrote for Military
Review Its an operational
assessment of the battle of Al
Bathra In it I propose three
operational alternatives to your
the decision you made

SERLING
Only three

LT CHELLI
I thought you might like to read
it

SERLING
No Thank you

Serling tries to give it back to the Lieutenant

LT CHELLI

Im not being critical sir
SERLING

No
LT CHELLI

You dont want to read it sir
Im sure youve gone over the
incident many times There might
be a solution here that you didnt
think of

SERLING
I doubt it I doubt it very much

He gives the envelope back and walks away

has been tacked to the floor

Sitting in a chair in front of the bandstand is a man in his
late 40s wearing black pants and a khaki shirt -- civilian
clothes but he probably would make anything he wears look
like a uniform TOP SIDARIS He sits arms folded listening
to a young band long hair Salvation Army clothes flail

not physically just drained He gets to his room opens

between the door and the floor Serling pulls it out

The vague black outline of a rolling monster in a dark desert
landscape

BOOM That vehicle blows up In the fire and flame it
becomes an Arab M110 tank

BOOM Secondary explosions tear off the turret An American
tank M1Al Abrams rolls by the burning vehicle Serling a
Major is half-in-half-out of the Abrams on the radio The
desert is full of tanks on line Americans rolling across

the battlefield leaving burning enemy tanks behind them

rising from the bowels of the earth four tanks emerge T-

The one Serling passed swivels its turret until its big gun

is aimed at the backs of the Americans

They fire The huge guns belch a column of flame at the
Americans Serling is riding along calling out orders
keeping his company in line when

The Abrams to his left blows up

troop from that vehicular accident
We were getting ready to move
forward provide support for
elements of the 82nd Airborne and
the 24th Mech

SERLING
A routine run

TEEGARDEN
Well kinda routine We were in

and Ive been home for years
Sorry

He is embarrassed and goes back to his Gameboy

SERLING
When did you realize Fowlers ship
might be in trouble

TEEGARDEN
Well you sort of know how long a
mission takes how long enroute
the pick up how long to the MASH
how long to return I give ‘em
some leeway I gave Fowler almost
an hour Then I called HQ They
confirmed the pick up Then I got
the MASH unit on the horn and found
out Fowler hadnt delivered I
wasnt that worried A sandstorm
could have put ‘em down

He looks at Cousins

COUSINS
Sometimes the visibility was so
bad you set down to wait it out
They usually blew over

TEEGARDEN
But I called Air Rescue anyway

How did Captain Walden get involved
in the search

TEEGARDEN
She came to me

The Blackhawk takes off outside Teegarden watches it go

TEEGARDEN
When she first came to the unit
Walden rode co-pilot with Fowler
during her orientation They were
friends Theyd traded envelopes

SERLING
Traded envelopes

TEEGARDEN
When we first got there on the
way over actually we each wrote a
letter to whoever in case we
didnt come back We didnt know
what we were getting into Saddams
crack army best in the world in
continuous control for years We
were green So we wrote these
letters and traded them You know
in case anything happens to me
send this to my folks my wife
I actually found Captain Waldens
letter in Fowlers footlocker when
we packed his effects I sent
it to her folks

SERLING
Captain Walden and Fowler were
close

TEEGARDEN

No closer than anyone else No
romance or anything if thats
what youre implying
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

SERLING
Im not implying anything

TEEGARDEN
We were all close Just the few
of us four choppers and their
crews Most of the time we were
off by ourselves We were
yeah close

SERLING
I was in a tank unit in Desert
Storm I know how close you get --
especially in combat Im sorry
So Captain Walden approached you

TEEGARDEN
We were all monitoring the rescue
channels Captain Walden came to
me Karen knew Fowler knew his
flying habits thought she could
retrace his route

SERLING
You agreed

TEEGARDEN
(angry)
Yes were Medevac Rescue is our
business too

SERLING
Im not questioning your decision
Major So she went

TEEGARDEN
Not right away I made her wait
an hour in case Rescue came up
with something Then I said okay
I made her strap on the extra fuel
pods She was not to attempt
evacuation There were too many
on Fowlers Blackhawk for the Huey
anyway Waldens mission was to
spot Dust Off Two go for altitude
to call in the location then render
what aid they could until the rescue
team arrived Those were my orders

this thousands of times Serling is seated in the back
given a helmet strapped in

They take off The dialogue throughout the flight is heard
over the intercom

SERLING
Did Captain Walden file a flight
plan

TEEGARDEN

Not as such but we discussed her
route She was going to follow
the Euphrates along the Eastern
bank Fowler used to say he flew
English style on the wrong side
of the road Some kind of silly
business to confuse the enemy I
used to tell Fowler that personally
I thought he was confused but
Finally I told Karen Captain
Walden she could fly

SERLING
Finally

TEEGARDEN
Well to tell the truth I was
delaying her as much as I could
hoping that Rescue would come up
with something

went down it got dark before we
But Walden was insistent so I
said okay Besides I figured
there couldnt be any harm in having
another pair of eyes out there
looking for Fowler

SERLING
You feeling some reservations about
your decision

Teegarden turns to look back at Serling They are flying
over the base Serling trying not to look down

TEEGARDEN
What the hell does that have to do
with the action of Captain Walden
on 26 - 27 February 91

SERLING
None I just Did you have any
contact with Captain Walden after
she left your base camp

TEEGARDEN
We lost contact after she was twenty
minutes out or so She was keeping
low like I said our ceiling was
down to give the jets a lower
profile She put down once because
a dust storm degraded visibility

SERLING
You learned this on the radio

TEEGARDEN
No That I learned after the
action

SERLING
Please stay with what you personally
witnessed Ill be interviewing
the crew later Why did you send
along Specialist Altameyer and the
machine gun Isnt that unusual
for a Medevac

have been some trigger happy

Plus Waldens mission was not to
evacuate but to locate and report
There was an MP unit next door to
our base camp Altameyer was always
hanging around the company area
He had a hard-on for choppers

CREW CHIEF
Dont we all

Teegarden smiles at his Crew Chief They are over the area
A ground soldier guides them in for the landing The Medic
bails and runs to where a group of soldiers circle a prone
man

SERLING
So the next time you heard anything
of Waldens situation

TEEGARDEN
It was a rough night As soon as
the sun went down and neither
aircraft had returned I dont
think anyone in the company got
any sleep At first light Division
Intelligence and Search and Rescue
reported they had satellite infrared
photos they thought might be our
two birds We cranked up and went
in with the rescue party I flew
one Huey Captain Liebman our other
Blackhawk

The Medic comes running to the Huey accompanying a litter
The litter is put aboard

Serling looks at the man on the litter He is all puffed
up red faced gasping for air

The man struggles as the Medic tries to insert a tube through
his throat Serling calms him

SERLING
Youre going to be okay troop
Just relax Youre in the best of
hands Just relax

Finally the tube is in and the man is getting air The

patient relaxes Serling lets go of him and sits back down

and Monfriez started talking
Thats when I wrote up the citation
I didnt expect the Medal of Honor
would actually come through Most
of them get knocked down to the
Silver Star or an Air Medal but

extraordinarily this soldier had
performed

just go for altitude and call in
the location

TEEGARDEN
And watch that tank chew up Fowler
and his crew -- the patients
People were in trouble We help
people in trouble Its our job
SERLING

Would any of your other pilots
have done the same

TEEGARDEN

I dont know Would I I dont
know I hope so Id hope we all
have in us whatever Captain Walden
found that day But Was she a
hot dog Was she Audie Murphy
Why did she do it What does
this have to do with the citation

SERLING
Nothing Just curious

TEEGARDEN
Same here Same here

The Medic comes back with five Dr Peppers He tosses one
to each of the men They all drink - except for Serling

Drinks finished Teegarden lifts the chopper off the pad

SERLING
Then why did you transfer them out
of your unit after Desert Storm

TEEGARDEN

Well Altameyer wasnt mine in the
first place he was an MP Youll
have to ask his CO Ilario and
Monfriez requested transfer for a
variety of reasons their own I
had no reason to deny it After
what theyd done it was the least
I could do The least

They land at the airstrip Teegarden shuts the Huey down
SERLING

Thanks Major I might call you
back with some follow ups

TEEGARDEN
She gonna get it The Medal of
Honor

SERLING

Just a matter of rubber stamping
the paperwork as far as I can see

TEEGARDEN
Good

The helicopter is still They walk back to the quonset hut

but hes paused at the top of the rope

ALTAMEYER
Cmon Fedderman Choppers leavin
The wars waiting on your ass
What are you afraid of All you
can do is break your spine It

set of wheels

Altameyer quickly hooks up to one of the ropes and jumps
over the side of the platform Head down

Altameyer plummets the fifty feet - not sliding - falling
the whole way head first He puts the brakes on for the
last two yards and comes to a stop - his head inches from
the ground

Fedderman the recalcitrant student ashamed comes down in
fits and starts Altameyer watches

ALTAMEYER
Cmon soldier Let loose Scare

Fedderman is down The Ranger goes over to Altameyer and
pulls him aside Serling cant hear them but it is apparent
that Altameyer is getting his ass chewed At the end of the
dressing down the officer points to Serling and Altameyer
comes over salutes

crashed Blackhawk

ALTAMEYER
Half hour forty minutes

Altameyer pauses busies himself with his hands It is
evident Serling has to prompt him

SERLING
So tell me what happened

ALTAMEYER
Well it all happened so fast at
first Then it seemed to take
forever We came around a bend in
the river - and there it was

Nervously Altameyer scrapes a fingernail across the wooden
bench Rhythmic scraping

EXT HUEY DAY

The same rhythm but the chop chop of the blades as the Huey
zooms along the river thirty feet off the ground The river
runs through a wide canyon the cliffs and ridges rise above

Altameyer rides in the rear door pilots side machine gun

at the ready In back with him are CREW CHIEF ILARIO a
MEDIC and SP4 MONFRIEZ Up front -- CAPTAIN WALDEN piloting
and her co-pilot WARRANT OFFICER RADY

They follow the meandering water as it curves around a bend
And abruptly come across a battle The crashed Blackhawk
survivors firing their weapons

Across the river bank -- the tank A round explodes from
the tank gun Flame belches from the cannon Ground troops
move toward the crashed Blackhawk firing as they go

ILARIO
There they are

MONFRIEZ
Fuck a tank Theyre in deep
shit

WALDEN
Theres your target Altameyer
Get it

Walden banks hard Standing on the skid hanging from his
safety strap Altameyer watches the tank appear in the open
void directly beneath him He opens fire

The bullets glance off the steel hide of the tank The
machine gunner on the tank unleashes a stream of fire at the
chopper The clank of bullets slapping into the aluminum
shell of the Huey A couple of holes appear magically under
Monfriez feet

MONFRIEZ
Holy shit Were taking fire

The tank cannon goes off again A huge explosion near the
Blackhawk Enemy fire peppers the Huey

WALDEN
Ill try another pass

ALTAMEYER
Wont do no good I might as well
be pissing on that tank

Monfriez gets it he goes to unhook the big square fuel pod
Altameyer scrambles to find the survival kit

ALTAMEYER

Ilario finds it for him passes him the flare gun and a flare
Altameyer fumbles the flare into the barrel Walden banks
the chopper to go back to the tank

They fly over the crashed Blackhawk Desperate faces look
up at them Rady is twenty feet away from some kid Their
eyes meet

RADY

Otherwise there wont be anything

shout yell in triumph But only for an instant They are
in trouble Walden frantically fights the controls The
chopper tail is out of control

WALDEN Grab something Hold on Rady call in a Mayday

She looks over Rady sags in his chair blood pouring down
his chest The window in front of him is shattered by bullet
holes Walden switches channels on the radio Ilario straps
into the seat Monfriez hooks up

WALDEN

They crash They hit hard It is awful quiet for a moment
Dust settles A hot engine ticks as it cools A moan A
little movement Altameyer hangs by his safety strap outside
the chopper door the 240 dangling over his head The barrel
is inches from his nose He skitters out of the way It
hurts to move He gets up painfully The chopper has splayed
its skids sits in an angle The rear rotor is imbedded in
the roof protruding inside Walden unbuckled is bending
over Rady

WALDEN
Ilario Radys hurt

Ilario is fumbling with his straps Monfriez is hanging out

goes off The ground troops small figures on the ridgeline
begin to fire Rounds pock the Huey kick up grit on the
rocks between the Huey and the ridge

Four or five enemy soldiers have positioned themselves up
the river behind a pile of rocks Someone from the Blackhawk
fires on them

MONFRIEZ
We try to get there we walk right
into their guns Carrying Rady we
might as well Just shoot ourselves
save them the bullets

She looks out over Altameyers shoulder The enemy troops
have stopped moving finding cover in the rocks below the

ridgeline Occasionally one of them shoots The bullets

punch holes in the chopper but the main body is protected
by a outcropping of stone Altameyer returns fire Short
two or three-round bursts from the 240

She looks at the men They dont feel a bit of her
confidence Actually neither does she

One enemy soldier with no live target is firing at the Hueys

Full magazines emptied in one long blast perforating the
aluminum tail Laughter then another long burst BURRUPP

At the other door Monfriez cradles the M-16 while Captain
Walden has her own pistol in hand

WALDEN
I wish the moon would come out

She looks up There is a hint of the moon behind the clouds
when they thin

ILARIO
You think Air Rescue will come

MONFRIEZ
Most likely theyll wait for first

WALDEN

We just have to hold our water
until morning

I can hear them out there moving
and talking - when you people arent
gabbing

WALDEN
Then I suggest everybody

BAM She shoots right past Monfriez head An Iraqi soldier
falls firing his weapon Suddenly the Huey is under attack
from all sides They hardly see the enemy except when he is
lit up by his own gunfire

A small firefight Typical Instant chaos Gunfire that
merges into one big blast of noise

Then silence The enemy can be heard scurrying away The
metallic clatter as Walden fumbles to reload her Beretta
She fumbles because her left arm is shot up in her forearm
a bone splinter pokes through the bloody hole She has
another bullet in her stomach She gets the Beretta loaded

isnt really dead for them That

I know that Kuwait thing wasnt
his cross to bear I know that

But I want him to know something
If he gets ready to send our kids
off to fight he better have tried
everything he could to avoid it
first Im talking negotiating
like it was his own life -- or his
kids It seemed after Vietnam
for a while there we thought twice
before sending our kids in harms
way Lately though its more
like every time some half-assed
politician starts dipping in the
opinion polls he invades some
pisspot country And American
kids die If hes going to do
that -- it damned sure better be
worth it Damned sure

He is surprised at his own passion He calms down
JOEL

Thats what I want to tell him

Serling shakes the mans hand

SERLING
I hope you do

He gets in the car and drives away

shoulder And the flame leaps from to Boylan to Patella
Both men are on fire but ignore it

PATELLA

Patella reaches up to touch Serlings leg with a flaming
hand The fire attaches itself to Serling and works its
way up his body In the flickering flames Serlings face is
revealed A frightened man Stark naked fear

SERLING

yards youll ever traverse in your life The students
scramble through it in teams One team leader makes it Or
thinks so Altameyer gets in the team leaders face

ALTAMEYER
What the fuck are you doing
soldier Where are your men

The team leader turns to show his men But Altameyer points
to the course One man hopelessly tangled up in the barbed
wire left behind

ALTAMEYER
You dont leave a man behind
Look at me when Im talking to

man behind Never Youre
brothers He depends on you You
depend on him

He goes over the top starts pushing the soldier around

The line between the heroes and

Serling turns to look at Ilario

many heroes didnt cross it
because they were more afraid of
being called a coward than they
were scared of dying

I was just thinking the same thing

Wanna talk

She doesnt answer shifts her position gasps from the pain
that shoots through her Monfriez moves forward She points
the Beretta at him

ALTAMEYER
What if they attack again

WALDEN
Youll get your weapons back

ALTAMEYER
By the time you give ‘em back it
might be too late

WALDEN
Its already too late

MONFRIEZ
You cant stay awake You wont
last to first light

She just stares at him grimly determined Ilario starts
crying For himself For her Hard to tell

FADE OUT - FADE IN

Walden is heavy-eyed Altameyer Monfriez and Ilario watch
her Ilario is tired scared sick of the situation of
himself The M-16 barrel slowly drifts down Waldens head
drops eyes ease closed Monfriez moves toward one of the
pistols Waldens head pops up eyes jerk open She points
the Beretta at him The M-16 muzzle goes up to check
Altameyers movement The sun is rising Light glows behind
the ridgeline Two silhouetted figures scramble over the
rocky line Altameyer sees it

EXT SAN ANTONIO RIVER NIGHT

The street light flickers and comes on Ilario stares at
it sitting on the bench Serling standing over him looks
at the ground

ILARIO
We talked Monfriez said she would
have Court Martialed us Altameyer
agreed Who knows She was
probably killed by enemy fire before
the jets came Who knows

SERLING
You really believe that

ILARIO
No

And he weeps Serling waits

ILARIO
I figured out what all those
veterans have in common Fear
Theyve all been scared as they
will ever get Theyve plumbed
the bottom of fear Petrified
scared Until your heart stops
your lungs cant get air scared
sick And nothing can ever scare
you like that again Youve seen
yourself at your worst and so

SERLING

I think youre right Ilario
ILARIO

You do
SERLING

I did something in Desert Storm
Everybody said I made the best
decision I could at the moment
They thought that it was a tactical
decision But only I know that I
made the call out of fear Sheer
stark naked fear for my own life
And I was wrong Some men died
They can justify it all they want
but deep down inside I know I did
what I did because I was just
plain simple scared Its okay
to be scared in combat

SERLING (CONTD)
It makes sense But when it
overrides your duty -- youve
crossed a line We both crossed
the same line Specialist Lets
get you some help

He offers a hand to Ilario Ilario takes it selfconsciously
rises Looks at Serlings watch

ILARIO
You have to get out of here
SERLING
Why
ILARIO
Altameyer was supposed to kill
you
SERLING

So He didnt

MONFRIEZ (0S)
So Im here to finish the job

Serling turns Monfriez stands there CAR-15 with a homemade
silencer at his side

MONFRIEZ
Good work Ilario I told you
youd find a way to keep him here

ILARIO
Youre not going to kill him The
killing is done

MONFRIEZ
No it isnt Im not going to
Leavenworth just because you
couldnt hold your water

He raises the gun and points it at Serling Ilario steps
between them

ILARIO
I wont let you Youll have to
kill me first

MONFRIEZ
Okay

And he shoots Ilario takes a slug in the chest goes down
Serling tosses his T-shirts into Monfriez face
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 132

Then kicks Monfriez into the river Monfriez goes under
with a big splash Serling goes to Ilario Ilario looks at
the hole in his chest

ILARIO
Now I know what to do here

He is dazed

SERLING
Im going for help

He starts down the walkway looking for an open door
Monfriez climbs out of the water He still has the gun He
fires Bullets tear up the door Serling is knocking on He
runs to another locked also He pounds on it The glass
shatters in a window next to Serling More gunfire

Serling runs down the walkway alongside the river Monfriez
pursues -- fires Serling is hit A bullet tears through
his side He falters Monfriez comes running Serling
gathers his strength and runs to a building under
construction He staggers past the No Trespassing tape
knocks down the crude barrier

INT BUILDING NIGHT

A maze of half-completed walls rebar poking out everywhere
half-connected plumbing scattered stacks of pipe and cement
bags Serling runs in and ducks behind the cement bags
They erupt into grey dust as Monfriez shoots at him

Serling tosses a piece of pipe at Monfriez and runs They
play hide and seek in the maze Serling plays every nook
and cranny every shadow and blind spot But Monfriez is
unflagging He pursues gun ready occasionally tossing off
a shot to force Serling to run Which Serling does and trips
over a pile of lumber He falls Monfriez comes after him
Serling tries to rise the lumber scatters beneath him and

he falls again Monfriez is above him The gun is leveled
at Serling

MONFRIEZ
Sorry its only a one-gun salute
Colonel
WHAM
Monfriez is hit from behind He falls Its Ilario wielding

a length of pipe Ilario jumps Monfriez They fall into a
tangle of flailing arms and legs The CAR-15 erupts Bullets
fly Serling has to duck Ilario is thrown back Monfriez
rises Serling tosses a bag of cement at him It explodes
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 133

Monfriez goes down again dust all over him He has dust in
his eyes But he fires the CAR-15 blindly wildly Serling
grabs Ilario and runs Slower now their wounds and the
fight draining them They make a turn go down a hall
another turn Dead end Nothing but cement block bare
conduit

ILARIO
Shit

Serling looks around desperate On the floor welding
apparatus Against the wall a wheeled table for the
electrician They can hear Monfriez coming

MONFRIEZ (0S)
Cmon guys Take it like a man

Ilario slumps against the wall Serling looks for a way
out There is none

SERLING
Like you did in the desert
Monfriez

MONFRIEZ (0S)
I did what I had to do

SERLING
Because you were afraid

MONFRIEZ (0S)
I wanted to survive

Serling finds a wrench on the floor A bigass monkey wrench
He hefts it in his hand A weapon He looks at Ilario who
shakes his head sadly

SERLING
What about taking care of your
fellow soldier

He looks at the acetylene tank goes to it and tries to lift
it He cant He looks at Ilario

MONFRIEZ (0S)
Thats all bullshit

SERLING
No it isnt Ilario just proved
it He saved my life

He looks at Ilario imploring JIlario gets up helps lift
the tank It is heavy Both men are in great pain They
put it on the cart
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 134

Serling puts the cart in the middle of the corridor

MONFRIEZ
Not for long

And he is at the end of the narrow hall He smiles
MONFRIEZ
Lets see how brave you are

Colonel

He comes at them Serling raises the monkey wrench Monfriez
looks at it

MONFRIEZ
Youll never get close enough to
use it
And he keeps coming Serling brings the wrench down -- on

the acetylene tank nozzle The nozzle breaks off Gas shoots
out of the tank at a fierce rate

The tank is propelled down the hall like a rocket the wheels
of the cart sing The tank and cart ricochet off both walls
Monfriez doesnt know which way to jump Sparks fly as metal
grinds against concrete The gas ignites The tank goes
faster It hits Monfriez in the chest Blows him into the
back wall Through the wall Both Monfriez and the tank
arc out over the river They splash into it Serling and
Ilario stagger limp to the hole in the wall They look
down In time to see Monfriez bob to the surface Dead
Chest crushed

EXT RIVER WALK NIGHT

The paramedics work on Ilario while Serling also bandaged
watches Ilario critiques the paramedics

ILARIO
You guys are good

PARAMEDIC
This is the city We get a lot of
practice on bullet wounds

The medics finish for the moment Serling looks at Ilario

SERLING
Thanks

Shes the real thing

SERLING
So are you

Ilario laughs derisively It hurts

ILARIO
At the wrong time

SERLING
Thats how it works We all have
the potential to be a hero or a
coward Were just human
Sometimes were scared --

sometimes Like you said -- its
a fine line We all live astride
it

The paramedics escort them both to the ambulance

SERLING
The secret is to admit to the
weakest part of ourselves accept
it and

ILARIO
And what sir

Serling doesnt know the answer until he says it

SERLING
---and ask for help when were too
weak to do it ourselves Thats
true bravery

A door has been opened to him He is still contemplating
what he said when the ambulance door closes on them
