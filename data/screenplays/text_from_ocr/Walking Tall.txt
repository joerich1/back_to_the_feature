warning A chance to defend yourself

CASINO GUARD 2

A casino is a license to print money
Why would I jeopardise that by selling

drugs

CHRIS
Cause you owned the town Jay Its changed
now

JAY

Really See the only thing that I think

has changed around here is that every
morning you get to wake up and put on

that nifty lil badge But underneath

that badge is the same guy that couldnt
make it playing college football apparently
couldnt make it in the army and not

gonna make it as a cop

CHRIS
Is that right

gonna be a man who doesnt live to see
