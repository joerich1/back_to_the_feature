NIGHT - CALIFORNIA DESERT

A blacktop highway curls from the foreground to the horizon
CAR HEADLIGHTS

appear at the far end of the road and rapidly approach

The edges of the highway are completely overgrown as though at
any moment nature may reclaim the blacktop for her own On the
horizon broken derelict powerlines stretch off into the
darkness

We hear the whine of a car’s engine as the headlights near
us then VOICES they have a faint electronic ring as
though talking over an intercom or radio of some kind

MARY (vo)
Anything on the scope

TOMMY (vo)
No wait

The car is a small station wagon painted a dull black Its rear
quarter windows are crudely covered with sheet metal and
rivets It has large off-road tires and is completely stripped
of decoration and frill

The car whips by us in a WHOOOSH

CAR INT

Two people with no passenger seat no carpeting and little
comfort The driver is MARY She’s about thirty-five short-
cropped red hair

The other is TOMMY ten years older his face weathered and
scarred a patch over one eye He sits in the rear in a swivel-
ling chair facing the back of the car Theres a computer
sereen and a keyboard in front of him

They talk above the roadnoise through lightweight headsets

MARY
What is it

TOMMY
Kill the lights and slow down

POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - MOVING

MARY
What do you got

TOMMY

I don’t know something in the road
up ahead
Mary slows the car In a moment we see a fire up the road a

little It gets’larger as we approach It’s a burning car

MARY
You know it
CAR INT
as it slows to a stop
TOMMY
Fred Maywood’s got a hardtail Ford
like that found it in a ravine up

in the valley

MARY

We better take a look
TOMMY

Whose turn is it
MARY

Yours Check environment

Tommy spins and ¢lacks at his keyboard He studies the screen
for a moment

TOMMY
trace of radiation probly
natural Airborne we got small
levels of Turner’s spore carbon
monoxide some neo-oxides all
breathable

Tommy Climbs up out of the back of the car and out through the
passenger door

TOMMY
sometimes I think itd be worth
dying from plague just to stay

outta that detox room

Mary undoes the bolts on a roof hatch a rough hole with a
plywood lid

CAR EXT

She stands up through the hole and drags up a large shotgun
She primes it with a snap of her elbow

TOMMY
I hate all that pokin’ and scrubbin’
-and the topical is the most dis-
gustin’

Mary smiles at Tommy She looks around the gun ready

Tommy approaches the car It’s nose is pointed down an embank-
ment He gingerly steps down the slope

TOMMY
Hell I dont think this is Freddy’s
rig

CLOSE ON MARY
about to speak when we hear another voice

VOICE
Just hand me that gun

Mary’s head snaps at the sound of the STRANGER
POV

She finds herself looking down the barrel of an old large
revolver Its held by a tall GAUNT MAN in his late forties
He has the tired all-too-human face of a dust-bowl survivor

She hands him the shotgun

GAUNT MAN
We were just about ready to give up
James Bring him back over here

WIDE

JAMES is a large man with an enormous misshapen head He has
an old rifle pointed at Tommys back as they walk towards Marys’
Gar

JAMES (thickly)
We ain’t gonna hurt nobody Just be
quiet and we ain’t gonna hurt nobody

GAUNT MAN (to Mary)
Get down and open the back James
get the car outta the ditch and get
it up here

Mary climbs down off the roof and moves to the back of the car
The stranger wraps his arm around Tommys neck and holds the gun
at his head

‘

a

Mary unbolts the rear hatch and swings it open

GAUNT MAN

What’re ya carrying tonight friend
MARY

t don’t know We don’t worry about

that

Inside is a long flat shipping case It’s made of fiberglass
heavily reinforced Mary pulls it out

GAUNT MAN
Is it vaccine
MARY
I don’t know We don’t Were

just delivering it
James pulls the other car next to them It’s worn and battered
the paint burned and scarred Whatever fire there was seems to
have been minor a fake James hops out
Mary hands the case to him

GAUNT MAN
Well take that can a gas too

Mary reluctantly unbolts a metal gas can from the back of the
car and hands it to James

GAUNT MAN
»In the car James

James circles the car and climbs into the passenger seat

The gaunt man pushes Tommy in front of him towards Mary and
climbs into the drivers’ side of his car

He waves the gun through the window

GAUNT MAN
You folks can go now

Tommy and Mary move slowly around their car and climb inside

TOMMY (whispering)
Let’s get outta here

Mary revs up the engine and turns and looks at the stranger
He addresses her softly as though she were a child

leans over his seat to watch
The box won’t come open

STRANGER

JAMES

Ags he pulls the lid open the box EXPLODES in a white hot
FLASH

INT MARYS CAR - MOVING
The strangers’ car BURSTS into flames in the rear window
Mary in the foreground stares straight ahead Tommy is turned

full around staring at the raging fire

TOMMY
Damn that was a good one

MARY
We don’t make any money blowing
things up

TOMMY
You gotta admit it’s fun though

CLOSE MARY

finally looks up into her rear view mirror at the fire

MARY
(in a whisper to herself)
Hell they were dyin’ anyway

THE BURNING FIRE

It’s as hot and loud as a blast furnace as it destroys the car
and all it’s contents

CUT TO

HIGH AND WIDE ON ROAD

Mary’s car speeds down the broken highway and into the night

CUT TO

A PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Aman ina suit tie and trenchcoat walks slowly under a
lone bent streetlight He is CHARLES SHEPARD

The parking lot is cracked and rotting with occasional clumps
of desperate grass punching through the blacktop

We see a battered sign with missing letters hanging on a large
decrepit building It says RAN HO RI JAM LL

Shepard approaches the building and finds a small side door
He knocks and waits

A tiny green light above the door flashes
SHEPARD
The mountain looms over the smoking
rubble and my heart longs for home

The green light goes out and the door CLUNKS open SHRPARD
steps inside

CUT TO

DESERT - NIGHT MARYS CAR

is stopped in the middle of an empty road Above it suspended
on rotting wires an ancient stoplight swings gently in the
breeze

Tommy and Mary stand on opposite sides of the car

Mary kicks the car violently three times The sheet metal
RATTLES and RINGS in response

TOMMY
Now cut that out You think that’s
gonna help Bad energy

MARY
Cmon the third time this week

Tommy strides around to the front of the car and lifts the
hood

TOMMY
Some of the parts in this car are
forty years old you should treat

it with respect

MARY
Your computer’s supposed to tell us
when something’s gonna go wrong

TOMMY
The computer says everything’s okay

MARY
Everything’s okay but the car
stopped

TOMMY
I’m workin’ on it

Tommy’s working inside the engine compartment He has a string
of wires pulled out

TOMMY
I just wish you had some respect for
technologythis car is an antique
you knowdamn few of ‘em left and
if the Cross had it’s way there’d be
exactly noneautomobiles would go
the way of sex and fresh fruit

Mary leans against the car and looks off down the road A light
flickers on her face

MARY

out almost parallel to the ground The car crawls along

white coveralls

HALLWAY - MOVING

We follow Tim and Shepard down a long dark hall

SHEPARD
I dont consider---

TIM

-«-they’re good people Doctor

you

SHEPARD
What could that be

TIM

They hate the plague Doctor they

They reach a corner and Tim guides Shepard around it

REPATR SHOP - TRACKING

on Tim and Shepard as they walk down a line of partially as-
sembled cars and trucks

SIBPARD
Mister Blore This must seem
strange my coming to you

Tim smiles and shakes his head

TIM
I truly cannot imagine what the Cross
would want from a plague carrier”
like me isn’t that what you call
us carriers

SHEPARD
I’m not here to make trouble Mister
Blore I need your help

Tim stops in the middle of the floor and stares Shepard direct-
ly in the eye

TIM
As of this morning I have ten cars on
the road a year ago I had thirty

five Five years ago I had a hundred
and ten One hundred and eighty three
of my recent employees are dead Shot
down burned out hanged you know
why Mister Shepard

SHEPARD
Doctor

TIM
because the Red Cross shut down the
borders sealed the city and state

lines to non-Cross personnel---

SHEPARD

---to stop the spread of disease
TIM

---to cut off the free market to

freeze out the other medical groups
to starve everyone who chose not to
live under the Crosses thumb But
closing roads didn’t cure anybody It
just cut out anyone who didn’t see eye
to eye with the Red Cross way of doin’
things

SHEPARD
I didn’t come here to defend--
BLORE
--Why did you come here
SHEPARD
T have a package I need to move it

quickly and quietly

TIM
I can do that for a price

SHEPARD
t1l pay you whatever it takes

Blore waits for Shepard to go on

SHEPARD
Do have access to an airplane

TIM (laughing)
A plane You gotta be shittin’ me--

SHEPARD
Im just--

TIM
--the ozone’s shotgo up during the

CAR EXT

Mary steers the car into an underground entrance She snaps the
car smartly around concrete barricades It’s an old parking
garage

Tommy reads unsurely like a third grader

TOMMY
The mountain looms over the smoking
rubble and my heart longs for home

(to Mary)
Where the hell do they get these
things
MARY

Youre supposed to memorize ‘em

TOMMY
Every time I get to know the damn
things they change ’em

Mary pulls the car up in front of a large set of corrugated
doors

CcuT TO

INT GARAGE
The big doors roll up as Mary pulls the car inside

Quickly the car is surrounded by people in white coveralls
They wear surgical masks tight bonnets over their hair rubber
boots and rubber gloves

One begins to hose the car down with steaming water Another
scrubs the car with a brush on a long pole A third moves what
looks like a metal detector over the surface of the car

Mary and Tommy climb out and we get a better look at them both
Tommy is short with a pronounced limp His hands and face are
coarse and scarred With his eyepatch he looks like a swabby
out of some old pirate movie In contrast Mary is tall
handsome and athletic They both wear gloves boots and worn
grey coveralls

They walk around the back of the car Mary unlatches the hatch
and swings it up

door

MARY
I don’t think that’s Smitty

TOMMY
They oughtta put numbers on their

DISPATCHERS OFFICE

PAUL sits behind a small glass window He wears a headset
and sits at a computer terminal

There are blinking computer screens everywhere around his room

The walls are covered with maps and notes Radio transmissions
fill the air

When Mary and Tommy enter the room a loud ALARM horn blasts
Paul hits a button and the alarm stops He talks to them over
an intercom

‘

PAUL
Man you guys are dirty

Mary and Tommy heave the case onto a moving conveyor belt It
disappears into a hole in the wall

MARY
Had some trouble Paul
PAUL

MARY

Tommy waves the question away

TOMMY

Paul scratches his head a moment and points behind Tommy Tommy
and Mary turn around

POV

A figure stands in the doorway Its a large female wearing a
huge gas mask She carries a long narrow scrub brush in her
hand It’s RUTH

TOMMY
Oh no

Ruth walks up to Tommy and clamps a big fist on his shoulder
Mary laughs out loud

RUTH (muffled)

Mary bursts through the door Shes changed into fresh cover-
alls her hair’s wet

MARY

Mary stops and stares at Shepard

MARY

SHEPARD
The Red Cross is not the government

MARY

Shepard takes a breath

SHEPARD
Have you heard of DNV 47X toxemia
MARY
Ultraplague
Shepard nods
SHEPARD

then you know that this particular
strain of plague is exceptionally con-
tagious it’s infected Saint Louis
Chicago We haven’t had aradio signal
from New York in almost two months
and last week seventeen cases were
discovered in Salt Lake

MARY
All the more reason for me to stay
right here

SHEPARD
and ordinarily Id call that a wise
choice but this disease is obvious-
ly relentlessly heading west
straight for us

MARY
So whattya want me to do about it
SHEPARD
Get my package to Salt Dake I’m a
molecular biologist a geneticist

and I think I’ve found a way to stop
the plagues

There’s a pause as this sinks in

MARY
Are you kiddin’

SHEPARD
t’m dead serious

MARY
Then why don’t you go

SHEPARD
Its become apparent that my superior
has no interest in my work ever
leaving the lab My only choice is to
go outside the Cross

MARY
No one other than Red Cross personnel
has gotten across the Nevada border in
two years

SHEPARD
Mister Blore seems to think youre the
driver with the best chance

Mary looks at Tim Tim shrugs

TIM (to Mary)
T’l1 get you ten thousand cash on
arrival in Salt Lake Ill front you
gas and supplies Split anyway you
like with Tommy

MARY (to Shepaxd)
That’s a lot of money What exactly
is it you need moved

SHEPARD
I thought you people didn’t ask that
question I thought you just took
the money and minded your own busi-
ness

Mary frowns and turns to the door She swings it open and steps
half way out

MARY

Look there isn’t anything I won’t
carry alcohol vaccine heroine
toothpaste explosives whatever you
want as long as there’s a payday at
the end But I gotta play the odds
and yours are lousy No amount a
money’s worth dying for not this

er any other job
SHEPARD
(suddenly forcefully)
But death is near for all of us

oO

Mary stops and looks at Shepard

SHEPARD
If I fail to get my work across the
desert I promise within a
year you and every one you know
will be dead at the hands of Ultra-
plague

MARY

SHEPARD

rough circle

There’s a flurry of activity FIVE or TEN PEOPLE run across

Sitting in the center of the circle is a box It’s about four
feet high two feet wide three deep It looks like an ordinary
shipping trunk but covered with valves pipes and scuba-like
tanks

Mary bends over the big map we saw earlier A small cookstove
sits next to her and she absentmindedly stirs a simmering pot
of something brownish She sips at it with a large spoon

Tommy is a few yards away from the car He peers out over the
edge of the campsite with a pair of binoculars

MARY
Anything
TOMMY
Nope were not bein’ followed
She stirs the stew
MARY

I guess this stuff’s about as good
as it’s gonna get

Tommy puts down the binoculars and joins Mary at the stove She
hands him a bowl of the goop

Tommy examines the bowl He pulls a spoonful of the brown stuff
and sniffs it

TOMMY
Where the hell did you learn to cook
anyway

MARY
Fuck you You don’t like it do it

TOMMY
I fix the car I man the radio if fT

The boy sits idly on the blanket Mary shoves a bowl of the
brown goop in front of the boy He stares at it

Tommy sticks a spoon out toward him He retreats when Tommy
nears then tentatively reaches out and takes the spoon in his

holds it like a dagger

MARY

TOMMY (smiling)
Slow

MARY
If we can cut the fence I think we
could make a run for it

TOMMY
Okay The fence works like a closed
loop burglar alarm Any break and it
sends an alarm to the main station
That alerts them of the break and
where it is It also sends a jolt of
live current into the offending partys
nervous system Now I can get around
the electric jolt I’ve got this bal-
last wired to the end of my boltcut-
ters And it’1ll take one of those
trucks at least five minutes to get

back here Fuck the alarm if we get
lucky we can probably be well hidden
by then

although annihilation is a concept
not to my taste I am still
prepared to make your stay here

SPOOR
This is your special guest Sister Host
One-eleven fourteen A

SISTER HELEN
A child

SPOOR
not a child a host created
in the lab to produce blood No more
human than a grapefruit

SISTER HELEN
He’s sick

SPOOR
Not sick dying yes but not sick
Far from it

Sister Helen stares at the video screens
her face brightening with comprehension

SPOOR
It was ten years ago that my research
staff first created a successful anti-
plague compound Unfortunately that
protein structure was very crude and
very aggressive and would more often
than not destroy the normal bodys
immune system

He stops at a bank of colorful video screens all
carrying vital medical information

SPOOR
Through exhaustive research in recom
binant genetic manipulation micro-cell
restructure and extra-uteral fertil-
jzation we were able to breed a host
body that could safely produce the

proteins without threat from the immune

system And this is the result of that
research The protein compounds car-
ried in this host’s blood resist all
known forms of toxemia

SISTER HELEN
He can’t get plague

SPOOR
Right including DNV 47X the
ultra plague and the blood can be
used as a serum directly with a

minimum of antigenicity Only a small
dose is necessary for complete im-
munity

SISTER HELEN
The cure for plague Doctor that’s
wonderful A cure

SPOOR
Yes Sister a wonderful extremely
dangerous discovery

SISTER HELEN
I don’t understand

Spoor turns the nun away guiding her down a row of medical
paraphernalia

no doubt

then turns to Spoor

Spoor smiles

SPOOR
Neither did some of my staff They
thought that rather than remain in
California the body should be sent
to Salt Lake City The front they
called it They went outside the
organization and hired a courier
a blackmarket messenger and without my
knowledge sent the body across the
state line My staff and I pursued
and intercepted the host not far from
here

SPOOR
But all of this will be over and out of
your way in another day Sister
Well be on our way back to California

SISTER HELEN
but he could do more good here

SPOOR
The body will be completely drained and
it’s heart stopped twelve hours from
now The remains will be destroyed

SISTER HELEN
Surely with proper care the body could
produce an unlimited---

SPOOR
---Yes I imagine it could but
Sister I imagine this may be difficult
for you to understand But the power
of the Red Cross is not so great that
we could maintain our success without
the plague In fact our strength
grows in direct proportion to the level
of disease

The nun stares at Spoor in disbelief

SISTER HELEN
But we must stop the plague if we can

SPOOR
The Red Cross has managed to save a
great many lives sister It’s my job
to ensure continued success of the
Cross itself Production of this anti-
plague vaccine must be vigorously
controlled Do you understand

SISTER HELEN

No

SPOOR

Sister what would gold be worth if
there were an unlimited supply What
would the value of the Hope Diamond be
if there were ten I intend to carry
four gallons of frozen plague serum
