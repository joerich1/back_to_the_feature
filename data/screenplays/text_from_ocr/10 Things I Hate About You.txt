A stray SKATEBOARD clips her causing her to stumble and
spill her coffee as well as the contents of her backpack

The young RIDER dashes over to help trembling when he sees
who his board has hit

RIDER
Hey -- sorry

Cowering in fear he attempts to scoop up her scattered
belongings

KAT
Leave it

He persists

KAT (continuing)
I said leave it

shuffles out the door bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN a lanky
brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game
show host

MS BLAISE the one-step-away-from-medication English
Teacher tries to remember what shes talking about

MRS BLAISE
Well then Oh yes I guess that

and the Sea Any other comments
(with dread)
Kat

Kat the girl we saw as we entered the school slowly cakes
off her glasses and speaks up

KAT
Why didnt we just read the Hardy Boys

MRS BLAISE
Im sorry

KAT
This book is about a guy and his
fishing habit Not exactly a crucial
topic

The other students roll their eyes

KAT
(continuing)
Frankly Im baffled as to why we still
revere Hemingway He was an abusive
alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of
cats

JOEY DORSEY a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones
makes fun of her from his row

JOEY
As opposed to a bitter self-righteous
hag who has no friends

A few giggles Kat ignores him A practiced gesture

MRS BLAISE
Thats enough Mr Dorsey

Really gets fired up now

KAT
I guess the school board thinks because
Hemingways male and an asshole hes
worthy of our time

She looks up at Ms Blaise who is now fighting with her
pill box

KAT
(continuing)
What about Colette Charlotte Bronte
Simone de Beauvoir

Patrick lounging in his seat in the back row elbows a
crusty-looking crony identified by the name SCURVY
embroidered on his workshirt

PATRICK
Mother Goose

The class titters Kat wears an expression of intolerance
INT GUIDANCE COUNSELORS OFFICE - DAY
Kat now sits before Miss Perky

MISS PERKY
Katarina Stratford My my Youve
been terrorizing Ms Blaise again

KAT
Expressing my opinion is not a
terrorist action

MISS PERKY
Well yes compared to your other
choices of expression this year todays
events are quite mild By the way
Bobby Rictors gonad retrieval operation
went quite well in case youre
interested

KAT
I still maintain that he kicked himself
in the balls I was merely a spectator
MISS PERKY
The point is Kat -- people perceive you

as somewhat

Kat smiles at her daring her to say it

KAT
Tempestuous
MISS PERKY
No I believe heinous bitch is the

term used most often
She grimaces as if shes referring to a medical condition

MISS PERKY
(continuing)
You might want to work on that

Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the
counselors

KAT
As always thank you for your excellent
guidance

INT SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in
big flowing handwriting

TEACHER (0S)
I realize the language of Mr
Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting
but Im sure youre all doing your best

Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip
of her hair to CHASTITY Chastity opens the note and reads

INSERT - JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL OH MY
GOD

Chastity frowns to herself
TEACHER (0S)
(continuing)
Ms Stratford do you care to comment
on what youve read so far

Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddys little girl

BIANCA

MANDELLA a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side
trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her
notebook looks up and raises her hand

very slow way to die

KAT
Whats this

MANDELLA
An attempted slit

Kat stares at her expressionless

KAT
I realize that the men of this fine
institution are severely lacking but
killing yourself so you can be with
William Shakespeare is beyond the scope
of normal teenage obsessions Youre
venturing far past daytime talk show
fodder and entering the world of those
who need very expensive therapy

MANDELLA
But imagine the things hed say during
sex
Thinks a minute
KAT

Okay say you do it You kill
yourself you end up in wherever you end
up and hes there Do you really think

PEPE
Some people like the Colombian but it
all depends on your acidity preference
Me I prefer East African and
Indonesian You start the day with a
Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian
Sidamo in your cup youre that much
farther ahead than someone drinkin
Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I

Michael nods solemnly
ACROSS THE ROOM

Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy making something that
looks like a machete out of a two-by-four

Cameron approaches full of good-natured farm boy cheer

direction

Cameron slinks away

(continuing)
Later then

MICHAEL
Well actually I thought Id run an
idea by you You know just to see if

He grabs Michael by the side of the head and proceeds to
draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker Michael
suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted

MICHAEL
(grimacing)
Hear me out You want Bianca dont

you
Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing
MICHAEL
(continuing)
But she cant go out with you because
her sister is this insane head case and

no one will go out with her right

JOEY

turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage
can rather than in it

busy setting up the plan you have time
to woo Bianca

Cameron grins and puts an arm around him

CAMERON
Youre one brilliant guy

Michael pulls back noticing other guys filing in

(reluctant)
Well no

CAMERON

BIANCA
But

CAMERON

BIANCA thinks a minute
He pulls up in front of the house

gives him a kiss on the lips He draws back in surprise
then kisses her back She smiles then gets out of the car
without another word

Cameron grins and drives away

If I go down Im takin her with me

INT ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

Kat and the other students sit at their desks taking a quiz
Patricks seat is conspicuously empty

From outside we hear the soft unsure beginnings of a SONG
Kat looks up then out the window HORRIFIED

The song grows louder until we realize its The Partridge
Familys I Think I Love You Being sung by Patrick

PATRICK
(O S)
This morning I woke up with this
feeling I didnt know how to deal with
and so I just decided to myself--

The STUDENTS rush to the window OUTSIDE Patrick stands
beneath the window crooning

Scurvy is next to him keeping the beat on the bongos and
doing backup vocal s

PATRICK
Id hide it to myself And never talk
about it And didnt I go and shout it
when you walked into the room --
He makes quite a sarcastic show of it

IN THE CLASSROOM

Mrs Blaise touches her heart as if the song is for her
Kat slowly walks to the window peeking below

OUTSIDE

Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big
finale

PATRICK
(continuing)
I think I love you I

INSIDE

The other students laugh clap cheer etc Kat sinks down
mortified but with a slight smile

INT DETENTION HALL - DAY

Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly mulling
over their misfortune

MISCREANT
Nice song Verona

PATRICK
Flog me

He makes the appropriate hand gesture

Mr Chapin the gym teacher sits at the desk in front
ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine

KAT (0 S)
Excuse me Mr Chapin

Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat
standing in the doorway She gives him a smile and he perks
up a little

Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr Chapin again He
turns fully to face her

KAT
Sir Id like to state for the record
that Mr Verona s current
incarceration is unnecessary I never
filed a complaint

MR CHAPIN
You didnt have to He disrupted a
classroom

Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the
window

Patrick shrugs not knowing what she s talking about

She motions again and looks toward the window with an
expression that says Make a break for it moron

Kat brings her attention back to Mr Chapin while Patrick
inches out of his seat toward the window

The other miscreants watch with glee

KAT
But Mr Chapin I hardly think a
simple serenade warrants a week of
detention There are far more hideous
acts than off-key singing being
performed by the student body ona
regular basis

Patrick is halfway out the window now And none too happy
about it considering theyre on the second floor

He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR CHAPIN He
starts to turn away from Kat

MR CHAPIN
Youre not gonna change my mind Kat

Rules stick

Kat starts to panic as Patrick has yet to make the jump for
the tree

KAT
Wait Mr Chapin Theres something
Ive always wanted to show you

He turns back toward her again the very second before he
would have spotted Patrick

Kat glances toward the window Patricks just about to make
the jump

MR CHAPIN
What

KAT
These

From behind we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra
at Mr Chapin just as Patrick makes the Jump

The miscreants cheer for both the daring escape and the
flash of skin

Mr Chapin reddens and tries to be stern

MR CHAPIN
Im going to let that slide Katarina
But if I catch you doing that again
youll be in here with the rest of these
guys

He motions to the remaining detention prisoners without
noticing Patricks absence

Kat smiles at him

KAT
Thank you Mr Chapin

Kat bolts out the door Mr Chapin goes back to his muscle
mag wiping the sweat from his brow

EXT SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN

Kat arrives at the tree looking around breathlessly seeing
no one

KAT
He left I sprung the dickhead and he
cruised on me

PATRICK
(O S)
Look up sunshine

She does Hes still in the tree

PATRICK
I guess I never told you Im afraid of
heights

KAT
(smiling)
Cmon Its not that bad

PATRICK
Try lookin at it from this angle

She assesses the branch structure

KAT
Put your right foot there --

PATRICK
Forget it Im stayin

KAT
You want me to climb up and show you
how to get down

PATRICK
(voice trembling)
Maybe

She sighs and dose so When she gets to his level she
perches on the branch next to him He grins at her

Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a
monkey leaving her sitting there realizing shes been

duped

KAT
You shit

She climbs down after him
EXT OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY
Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games

KAT
The Partridge Family

PATRICK
I figured it had to be something
ridiculous to win your respect And
piss you off

KAT
Good call

PATRICK
So howd you get Chapin to look the

other way

KAT
I dazzled him with my wit

She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at
giggling hyenas and wails on it The barker hands her a
stuffed animal as her prize She hands it to the small KID
next to her and they continue walking

PATRICK
(sarcastic)
A soft side Who knew

KAT
Yeah well dont let it get out

PATRICK
So whats your excuse

KAT
Acting the way we do

PATRICK
Yes

KAT
I dont like to do what people expect
Then they expect it all the time and
they get disappointed when you change

PATRICK
So if you disappoint them from the

start youre covered

KAT
Something like that

PATRICK
Then you screwed up

KAT
How

PATRICK
You never disappointed me

She blushes under his gaze
PATRICK
(continuing)

You up for it

KAT
For

He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game She grins
SERIES OF SHOTS

The two of them creep through the paint-ball course
stealthy and full of the desire to best the other

Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint
Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue

Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of
her face

Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more
shots theyre both covered in paint

She tries to shoot him again only to find that her gun is
empty

KAT
(continuing)
Damn it

Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle They land
laughing

Its hard to even recognize them as their hair and faces
are so smeared with paint globs but they still manage to

find each others eyes

He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips as he
goes to kiss her

NEARBY The kid with the stuffed animal points

KID
Look Mom

His mother hurries him away Whats started as a tackle has
turned into a passionate kiss

PATRICK

KAT

KAT

PATRICK
Why not

KAT
Because I dont want to Its a stupid
tradition

Patrick sits quietly torn He cant very well tell her he
being paid to take her

PATRICK
People wont expect you to go

Kat turns to him getting angry

KAT
Why are you doing this

KAT
All of it -- whats in it for you

He sits silently not looking at her confirming her
suspicions

KAT
(continuing)
Create a little drama Start a new
rumor What

PATRICK
So I have to have a motive to be with
you

KAT
You tell me

PATRICK
You need therapy Has anyone ever told
you that

KAT

(quietly)

me

Bianca stares at her dumbfounded

BIANCA

KAT
After that I swore Id never do
anything just because everyone else
was doing it And I havent since
Except for Bogeys party and my
stunning gastro-intestinal display --

BIANCA
(stunned)
Why didnt you tell me

KAT
I wanted to let you make up your own
mind about him

BIANCA
No you didnt If you really thought
I could make my own decisions you
wouldve let me go out with him instead
of helping Daddy hold me hostage

Kat stands up slowly

KAT
Thats not

BIANCA
Im not stupid enough to repeat your
mistakes

KAT

I guess I thought I was protecting you

BIANCA
God youre just like him Just keep me
locked away in the dark so I cant
experience anything for myself

KAT
Not all experiences are good Bianca
You cant always trust the people you
want to

stares at the floor

The look they exchange says everything

Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains
in stunned silence

greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar reclining in the
front seat

She picks it up slowly inspecting every detail then spins
around

Patrick stands there smiling

KAT
A Fender Strat You bought this

PATRICK
