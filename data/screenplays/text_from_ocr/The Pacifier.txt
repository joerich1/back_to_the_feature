EST HOSPITAL - DAY
TITLE CARD 1 Month Later
INT HOSPITAL - DAY

Shane lies in a hospital bed despondent His arm and
face bandaged

Shanes Captain enters BILL FAWCETT -- friendly
unassuming He looks like he hasnt slept in days Shane
salutes him with his bandaged arm -- it hurts to salute

but he does it anyway

SHANE
Captain sir

BILL
As you were Lieutenant

Bill sits down beside the bed He takes a long look at
Shane He holds a REPORT in his hand

BILL (CONTD)
Weve been through a lot together Shane
Youre the best man I ever trained And a
good friend
SHANE
I know sir And I except full
responsibility for the missions failure

BILL
Why the hell did you let him use the
satellite phone

SHANE
He had to call his family A lapse in
judgement on my part that I regret sir

Bill shakes his head disappointed He pulls up a chair
and sits opposite Shane

BILL
Plummer was the best security expert
the department of defense ever had -- a

genius He was working on a program that
scrambles launch codes He called it
GHOST Guided High-altitude
Scrambling Transmitter One pulse from
the GHOST satellite and a country cant
launch its own nukes Thats what the
Serbians kidnapped him for but they
couldnt get S

inside the briefcase

SHANE
The case was empty sir as I stated in my
report

Bill considers this Then

BILL
Not a surprise really Not like the
professor to hide things where someone
might look for them GHOST is still
out there (Bill smiles) which is why
Im going to give you another shot

Shane sits up He cant believe his good fortune
SHANE
Sir Thank you I appreciate your

confidence

Invigorated he pulls off bandages disconnects an IV
and starts to rise

SHANE (CONTD)
Ill need to put a team together Im
gonna need the mini sub I need access to
an EP3 aries 2 spy plane

BILL
(interrupting)
Negative Its not that kind of mission

Shane listens intrigued

BILL (CONTD)
Two days ago I got a call from the
professors wife Widow She told me
someone had broken into her home
Searched the place top to bottom
(MORE)

BILL (CONTD)
Shes scared The familys scared
Whoever killed the professor must think
GHOST is in that house Maybe it is
maybe it isnt Either way I need
someone to stay at that house and
protect them And while youre there --
find out if the program is in there

SHANE
Thats it Why would you want me for
that sir

BILL

The professors wife requested you

Shane is surprised Bill pulls a tiny tape recorder
from his pocket presses play we hear PROFESSOR
PLUMMERS voice

CHARLES (0S)
Honey Im alive Listen A lot can

happen between here and home -- if
anything happens to me call Lt Shane
Wolfe Hes a good man anyway I
should go Ill call you in an hour I
love you

Shane is shocked hearing the dead mans voice
BILL

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - AFTERNOON

A taxi door opens Shane looks like a bad ass ready for

doll on the sidewalk It SQUEAKS

Shanes POV Julies unkempt suburban house with toys
all over the lawn and a BLESS THIS MESS welcome mat

Shane double-checks the address The sprinklers go off
Shane darts to the door and rings the bell (its one of
those long cheerful doorbells)

WE hear TINY FEET approach -- then the door swings open
Shane looks down -- and sees LULU 8 peering up at him

Shane eyes Lulu Lulu eyes Shane then
LULU

at ease at all)

SHANE
You have a pleasant family maam

JULIE
Charles wasnt around too much His work
took him all over the world Hed be gone
six or seven months at a time So I
think for the younger ones its a little

confusing Zoe and Todd well theyre
dealing like your normal teenagers
Maybe in Todds case semi-normal

SHANE
Mrs Plummer I have to tell you that I
did everything I could

JULIE

Charles was in a dangerous business I
knew it when I married him No ones to
blame here

(beat)
Everyone thinks that Charles told me or
the kids where he hid it And until
GHOST is found were all in danger

SHANE
Nothing will happen to your family as
long as Im here Ive dealt with much

Suddenly from behind Shanes head a DUCK appears and
NIBBLES his ear Shane spins in full fight stance He
sees the Duck and relaxes Sort of

JULIE

The duck QUACKS angrily Confused Shane returns to at
ease keeping one eye on the duck

casually answers it Shane touches his ear transmitter
and LISTENS as he walks into the house

twenty dollar BILL

SHANE (CONTD)

Befuddled Scott starts to do lame push-ups Shane grabs
the back of Scotts shirt LIFTING him in the air
spinning him away from the house like a marionette Scott
runs off calling out from across the street
Ss
CoTT

Zoe storms inside Shane stands there fuming The
Alarms still blaring The window of the house next door

NURSERY (Peter and Tylers room) where Helga is singing
a lullaby (as annoying Has something Barney might sing)

ELGA
When youre down and low lower than the
floor
And you feel like you aint got a chance
Dont make a move “til youre in the

Just hop three times like a kangaroo --

She does a little dance that goes with the lullaby She
hops forwards three times then crab-walks sideways

HELGA (CONTD)
Sidestep twice just like the crabs do
Three steps forward one step back

She does The Children in bed -- laugh and laugh

BILL
As we discussed this is an urgent
matter

The Banker puts up a finger to shush him Then looks
back to the paperwork then licks his finger to turn the
page He licks his finger again but cant get the page
to turn

He feebly gets up and shuffles across the room to a
WATER COOLER He fills a paper cup with water and
shuffles back to his desk He dips his finger in the
water to turn the page

JULIE
Cant you call somebody Do something to
get us around all this paperwork

BILL

Shane wades into the ball pool and pulls Peter out which
is fine except that hes MISSING HIS DIAPER

MANAGER (CONTD)

Shane grimaces He holds his breath and goes down for
the diaper He disappears under the balls -- for a long
time The Manager and the Brownies share a concerned
look Hes still down there Silence

LULU
Should we send someone in after him

He surfaces gasping Hes holding the diaper out away
from him He charges across the room with the diaper

SHANE

Shane is exhausted as he pulls up in the Minivan He
gets out -- and groans in disbelief Its insanity HIP
HOP blasts gyrating TEENAGERS everywhere chugging
drinks making out peeing in the bushes jocks throwing

surroundings windows vents AH The doggy door

Scott is halfway through the doggy door when Shane grabs
his ankles and yanks him back in Shane holds Scott
upsidedown by his ankles

Start swabbing ladies

He hands Scott the mop Scott gulps - and starts mopping

evil that I deserve to be saddled with
the worlds worst production of Sound of

is why I quit
He throws down his script The Cast is stunned

man I knew youd figure it out

Shane scowls disgusted

BILL (CONTD)
You know if youre willing to join up
Id be happy to cut you in on the
proceeds What do you say -- we make a
good team
SHANE
I was devoted to you sir And you
betrayed all of that All that we stand
for

Beat Bill shrugs

BILL
Ill take that as a no

Bill turns to the safe He starts to reach for the
dial then catches himself Somethings not right

BILL (CONTD)
I think you better open it

Shane reaches for the safe before he reaches the dial --

BILL (CONTD)
Wait Thats just what you want isnt it

Bill thinks trying to read Shanes poker face Shane
shrugs Bill gestures to Mrs Chun

BILL (CONTD)
You open it

Mrs Chun doesnt budge

BILL (CONTD)
Oh come on I walked the floor first

Reluctantly - Mrs Chun reaches out and touches the
dial Nothing happens Relief She turns it and ZAPPPPP
1000 volts ELECTROCUTES her her hair on end shaking
from the voltage

Bill is off guard Shane kicks his gun away The gun
skids into the acid and plunges SIZZLING Bill is
incensed but Shane gazes coldly

SHANE
There will be no mercy

BILL
None requested

Full of himself Bill LUNGES And hes strong He
shoves Shane back then PUNCHES him in the gut

Shane glares then returns an onslaught of BLOWS
Shanes fury is unleashed A volley of attacks hitting
Bills arms head legs Hes crazed unrelenting

But suddenly Mrs Chun LEAPS onto his back

MRS CHUN
AAAAAA

She SCREAMS and grabs his throat Shane struggles to
lose her Suddenly he drops and FLIPS her She
catapults stumbles backwards across the room and stops
just inches from the acid She teeters tottering
unable to gain her balance

Shane shakes his head then runs to grab her outstretched
hand She smiles saved But hes unforgiving

SHANE
Youre a terrible neighbor

Shane COLD-COCKS her knocking her out Suddenly --

JULIE

Bill is charging him Shane whirls delivering a

ROUNDHOUSE KICK OOF Bill gets slammed in the chest

Bill tumbles the wind knocked out of him He jumps to
his feet delivering a series of hard punches which
Shane deflects -- they tangle like pros Its clear the
both have the same training They punch spin kick
connecting only occasionally Bill wheels around and
lands a kicks squarely in Shanes chest Shane tumbles
landing on his back in front of the safe

ANGLE - BILL

He steps over Shane Leering mercilessly he jabs the
spike against Shanes throat
