SQUIRMING BACTERIA 1

teem before us Theyre densely packed thousands maybe
millions of them wriggling with abundant life Pulling back we
realize theyre all contained in a single drop of water and
pulling back further the drop is one of many on a leaf and wo
think how truly insignificant those teeming bacteria really are
because --

EXT TROPICAL RAINFOREST DAY 2

-“- the leaf is one of oa thousand on a treatop and the tree one of
a million in a lush rainforest Jungle animals HOOT branches
bend as theyre scampered over the HUM of insects fills the air
life is everywhere

Heavy clouds part and all those billions of leaves turn upward
stretebing for the light that comes from the sun a brilliant
erange ball of warmth huge in the sky The sun dissolves to --

ext BARREN PLANET SURFACE DAY 3

-- another sun and the contrast could not be greater Where our
sun is full rich and hot this second sun is tiny small in its
sky its rays thin and weak

We tilt down to the surface of the planet below it A frozen
inhospitable plain stretches to the horizon obscured by driving
sandstorms that must render life above the surface impossible
Theres some evidence that this wasnt always the case thousand
year-old structures dot the surface but theyre abandoned now
worn away by the relentless battering of the storms

As for growth theres only one type of vegetation tough enough
to survive in this hostile environment -- a scrabbly red weed
Its mean and grasping its sharp tendrils clawed into any
crevice it can find in the sandblasted reck and buildings

EXT A KOURTAINSIDE DAY 4

Back on earth springtime blooms on a mountainside The sun
melts the winter snowfall on the banks of a stream chunks of
melting white snow are swept away by the swiftly moving water

High up in the air wa see the stream is part of a network that
feeds into a larger river its banks swollen with the rich spring
runoff This rich network of tributaries dissolves to --

BIT BARREN PLANET SURFACE DAY 5
- a wider view of the surface of the barren planet and a nearly

matching mountainside But this one is dead dried out rivers
carved into its face like acne scars A VOICE comes over

s

VOICE Ho one would have believed in the early
years of the twenty-first century that
our world was being watched keenly and
closely by intelligences groater than
mans and yet as mortal ag his own
That as mon busied themselves about
their various concerns

BxT SIXTH AVERUE DAY 6

One of those long-lens shots looking down Sixth Avenue in
Manhattan as the workday lets out People scads of them all in
a terrible hurry

VOICE «esthay were watched and studied the
way o man with a microscope might
scrutinize the creatures that swarm and
multiply in a drop of water With
infinite complacancy we wont to and fro
about the globe confident of our empire
over this world

As we watch the shot speeds up turns into tima lapse -- tho
people move faster turn into the rush hour crowd then thin out
as twilight falls We tilt up from the city as the last of the
evening cleuds race away the moon rises and sets the sky turns
to night and dissolves into --

EXT HOOK DOCKS NIGHT 7
-- a dazzling starfiold somewhere in outer space

VOICE Yet acroga the gulf of space
intellects vast and cool and
unsympathetic ragarded this oarth with
envious eyes And slowly and suroly

VOICE (CONTD)
«o- they drew their plans against us

Drawing close we realise its man-made an arclight on top of
the spindly mechanical arm of a container handler on tha docks in
Red Hook just across the Zast River from Manhattan Down here
on earth huge cargo ships are unloaded by LONGSHOREMEN working
the night shift

We follow one container up out of the hold of the ship and look
up the cables of the crane thats lifting it up to the windowed
cab susponded a hundred feet up in the air ‘Thera’s a guy in
there

Int CRAHE CAB NIGHT 8

RAY FERRIER the crane operator is in good shape but pushing
forty from the wrong side these days halfway through life and
feels like its taking forever

Hes bent forward looking through the cloar floor of the cab
atudying the cargo container hes hauling as he skims the huge
crane across the deck far below

EXT DOCK RIGHT 9

Down on the dock the crane nestles the twenty foot cargo
container into the back of a flatbed truck resting it gently in
a tiny spot

The container BANGS down into place the metal spreader that held
it de-couples and rises swiftly into the air

A SIREN blows in the distance loud shifts over
rut CAB NIGHT 10

In the cab Ray works the levers quickly shutting down hauling
the crane cab back to the top of the ladder that leads down to
ground level

As it CLUNKS into place he stratches out his back -- long shift

in that chair -- then reaches down into a bucket next to his cab

and grabs a chunky gold watch he puts there for safekeeping while
hes working He BRAPS it onto his wrist

EXT DOCK NIGHT ll

On the dock the HATCH BOSS is waiting at the bottom of the ladder
as Ray climbs down from the cab

HATCH BOSS
FYorrier I need you back in four instead
of twelve Ive got half of Korea coming
in at noon

Ray jumps the last six steps and hia boots hit the pavement He
heads for the parking lot

RAY

happy to tell you

ExT ANCHOR INN DAW 12

The sun comes up over the Anchor Inn a tavorn nestled under a
freeway overpass near the docks

Int ARCHOR IHW DAWR 13

A pinball gets smacked around the table BINGING off tho bumpers
in a hot game

Ray stands in front of it working the flippers He manages to
throw a hip into the pinball machine without upending the beer
bottle that rests on top of the glass Unfortunately the second
hip he smacks into the machina is a little too hard and the “TILT”
light lights up

RAY
Oh for

fhe flippers go dead and the bali rolls through
AT THE BAR

Ray reclaims his stool betwoon two other REGULARS The place
has a horseshoe-shaped bar with a half-dozen PATRONS at it ali
night workers just off their shift at the docks Ray looks up at
the BARTENDER » a cute slightly hardened woman in her late
thirties
13 i3

RAY (contd)
I want my quarter back You got the tilt
set too sensitive again

The Bartender does not dignify this with a response Ray shakes
his empty beer glass at her and the Bartender takes it

RAY (cont’d)
I want my quarter back

BARTENDER
From my cold dead hand

RAY
Nothing cold about your hands

BARTENDER
Sit down and behave yourself

She picks up the remote for the TV that hangs over the bar
fhere’s a news report on CHS we cant hear what the ANCHOR is
saying but the graphic is fleatingly legible --

Deadly Lightning storm in Ukraine

-- before the Bartender hits a button and flicks it over to
SportsCenter which is doing a report on the Yankees’ latest free
agent signing (FOR FULL TEXT OF BOTH REPORTS SEE APPENDIX A)

RAY
I dont know I dont know about this
guy he hits what 211 against left

figured out Pedro

A DOCKWORKER next to him shakes his head and gestures to Ray

DOCKWORKER
Two years of double A bell and he thinks
he’s an expert

RAY
What wo nood is another arm shoulda

Minnosota instead

DOCKWORKER

The Bartender comes back with Ray‘s beer which rominds Ray

RAY

The Bartender opens the cash register and SLAPS two quarters on

Bgr RAYS - STREET SIDE DAY 21

Ray comes out the front door of his house sngrily pulling on a
shirt over a pair of blue jeans Indeed his driveway is empty

RAY
You little shit You little sixtoen
year old shit

He walks to the street looks up and down it Wo sign of his car
or his son But across the street a GUY ig staring at him

And hes not the only one ‘THREE or POUR MORE NEIGHBORS step
forward drawn out of their houses to look at Ray who puta his
hands out as if to say “what

But as they move closer he notices theyre not looking at hin
but behind him slightly over him

He turns around

The skies behind his house are nearly black

Heavy storm clouds are moving in fast faster than wave ever
geen storm clouds move And theyre dark really dark more like
night headed this way than thunderclouds

A LRABTETAR NEIGHBOR steps up next to Ray as they both watch tha
skies

BRAZILIAN NEIGHBOR
You ever see anything like that

RAY
In tho spring maybe not this time of
year

The Bragilian Neighbor turns and says something to his WIFE in
Portugese She shakes her head and replies

Drawa to the storm Ray walks down his narrow driveway --

EXT RAY’S HOUSE - BACK YARD DAY 22
-- and into his backyard to gat a better look all the while
staring up st the sky OTHER NEIGHBORS are going into their own

backyards too and on this block the yards are close together
you can see down ten or twelve of them all at once

22

Laundry hangs off lines in many of the yards FLAPPING in a
freshening breeze A faw yards away a GUY WITH A POWER
LAWNMOWER walks back and forth cutting his grass

Ray turns and leoks down the yards to the left His MBXT-DOOR
NEIGHBOR a woman in her late twenties holding a TODDLER in her
arms ig standing at the fence line She wears a pair of motal-
framed eyeglasses Her drasa billows out around her legs the
air is moving faster now

CRACK

A wat towel hanging off her laundry line SNAPS in the breese
which should now be called a wind Tho laundry is standing out
nearly straight on the line but --

RAY
Thats weird

WEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR
What

RAY
Winds blowing toward the storm

-- it is indeed pointing toward the clouds ag if sucked in that
direction

Ray looks the other way All the laundry in all the yards seams
to reach out toward the storm

Behind Ray Rachel opens the back door of the house and steps
out The back door pulled by the advancing low prassure system
SLAMS behind her with such force it cracks the frame

Ray turns Gives her a reassuring smile

RAY cont‘d)
Come look it‘s cool

Rachel walks forward pulled slightly by the wind like walking
downhill He catches her laughing We havent seen him this
animated bofore

Tha clouds are nearly on top of them now and the wind is blowing
so hard --

-- actually no the wind isnt blowing any more in fact it
stops suddenly all at once Nothing moves not their hair not
the Neighbors lightweight dress not the laundry on the linos
nothing
1s 22

A few yards away the sound of the lawnmower abruptly stops too
its engine dying Ray turns The Guy who was mowing bands over
looking at the thing

In the alley behind the house a cars engine givas out the car
rolls slowly to a silent stop

The clouds are nearly on top of them

NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR Sure got quiet

Suddenly they hear a loud metallic CLANG from behind them They
turn and look

A metal garbage can lid is stuck to the side of a car defying
gravity They all look at it puszled and as they watch three
more garbage can lids lift off the tops of the cans theyre on
fly across a driveway and SMACK into the side of the car

RAY
What the hell

RACHEL DUCK

Ray does and good thing as a KIDS BIKE sails through the air
and SLAMS into a chain link fence sticking there

The Toddler starts to CRY

Rachel is standing right next to Ray his arm dangling near her
waist She CRIES OUT as a blue bolt of electricity CRACKS out
from his wristwatch and SAPS her belt buckle

RACHEL (cont‘d)
owl

RAY
What happened

Ray whips his watch off and drops it but instead of falling to
the ground it flies out and sticks to Rachels belt buckle

RAY (cont’d)
Its magnetized

As he apeaks the Lawnmower starts to move of its own accord
pulled across the lawn and SLAMMING into the side of a pickup
truck

Now the Toddler really starts to WAIL and the neighbor hurries
inside with him just as --

CONTINVED 22

RACHEL
Whats that smell

-- a lightning bolt RIPS across the sky over their heads
It doesnt touch the ground it just arcs between two spots in
the clouds above them but the CRACK is nearly deafening from the
massive release of energy
Neighbors GASP and SHOUT pointing upwards “Did you see that”
Rachel SHRIEXS and grabs on to her father he hustles her ovar to
the back door where they stand beneath the overhang
RAY
Its okay its okay

RACHEL
I want to go inside

RAY
A‘right go ahead

But he stays where he is wants to watch the show Rachel takes a
couple steps toward the house then comes back She doasnt want
to be by herself

Another lightning bolt CRACKS a jagged path in the sky above
them and the Neighbors who have stayed in their yards OOOH at
the impressive display

Still no rain and oddly no thunder either just huge releases
of energy over their heads

A third RIP of lightning above them and now the Neighbors CLAP
like at a fireworks show Hey this is fun

RACHEL
(warming)
Like the Fourth of July
RAY

Yeah thats it like-

A MONSTER of a lightning bolt strikes just behind the row of
houses that borders their back yards ‘The smell of char fills
the air a denso cloud of electrified dust wafts towards them
and tho SCREAM of whoever was in the vicinity of where it hit rips
across the open yards 22

The fun is over Neighbors run for their houses some are still
laughing but others are SHOUTING to each other to get the hell
inside whats the matter with you and now its as if that
first lightning bolt to touch the ground has released a flood of
enorgy because suddenly there is lightning everywhere arcing
across the sky striking trees and television aerials and
flagpoles and clotheslines even it‘s a trua lightning storn

Ray throws open the back door of the house grabs Rachel and
hauls her inside

THT RAYS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM DAY 23
Ray SLAMS the back door and locks it (not sure why xung to the
front door and closes that too giving us only a momentary
glimpse of whats going on in the front of the house -- lightning
is leaping from car to car like an electrical virus

But the door SLAMS and we dont see any more

Ray runs to the kitchen again where Rachel is curled up by the
back door terrified He bends down grabs her by the shoulders

RAY

Youre okay Youre fine
RACHEL

It hit right behind our housel
RAY

Well its not going to hit there again
okay Lightning doesnt strike in the
sane

CRASH Another gigantic lightning strike from right behind tha
house They twist over to the back window and peer up over the
ledge where they can see out over their backyard

THROUGH THE WINDOW 26
the lightning bolt has in fact struck in the samo placo just
behind that row of houses Aa they watch the bolt strikes

again the same bolt the same shape the same place

IN THE KITCHEN 25

Rachel SCREAMS Ray is stunned and while they watch the bolt
strikes a fourth time louder than any previous --

RACHEL

maddening -

RACHEL

RAY
(watching out the window)
Wheres the thunder

-- nine ten eleven its never going to stop

RACHEL
Why wont it stop

Ha grabs her and holds her tight as the lightning strikes
continue over and over and over again until finally it stops

Ray and Rachel stay frozen under the window silent eyes like
saucers Finally as if to announce that its really over --

-- all the magnets drop off the refrigerator and CLATTER to the
floor Thats weird

RACHEL (contd)
Is it over

Ray doesnt answer bacause he doesnt know Its darker in the
kitchen than it was before the suns down and no lights are on
Slowly Ray pulls away from his daughter and stands up
RACHEL (cont ‘d)

RAY

She nods backs herself up against the wall under the window

RACHEL

Its quiet unnaturally so but PEOPLE are moving in the streets
ao at first its hard to figura out the silance

Than we get it -- the cars arent moving Theres just as many in
tha street as before but they’re all stilled right where they
rolled to a stop

A thin acrid black smoke wafts over everything Ray takes a
step off the stoop --

ROBBIE Hey
-- and nearly jumps ont of his skin Robbie is sitting in a beat-
up old lawn chair behind tha door leaning against the house

RAY
Jesus

He lunges at the kid throwing his arms around him an embrace
Robbie doesnt return

RAY (contd)
Youre okay Are you hurt

Robbie shakes his head no His eyes are full of tears but he‘s
trying like hell not to show it

Re joins the stream of people heading up the street on foot

Robbie drops back into the chair and lets it tip back against the
side of the house with a THUD His head is right next to the
doorway now and he turns to seo Rachel standing just inside the
screen looking at him scared

RACHEL
Where did he go

EXT RAYS STREET - GAS STATION DAY 29

Ray reaches the gas station at the end of his block MANNY the
garage owner is in front working under the heed of a late-model
car with another MECHANIC

RAY

Manny looks up gestures around

MANNY

RAY

Manny gestures good idea

ExT THE INTERSECTION DAY 30

Ray rounds a corner and joins a STREAM OF PEOPLE headed toward a
four-way intersection about a half mile from his house same
kind of neighborhood as his but as he comes around the corner
wa see the difference --

«- there is a huge jagged scar in the pavement right across the
middle of the intersection It‘s about twenty feat long scorch
marks halo all around it

There are maybe a HUNDRED PEOPLE there looking at it most
huddled in small groups comparing stories (SEE APPENDIX AA FOR
DIALCGUE) Nobody seems to have been hurt and their initial
foar is starting to ease

30

There are half a dogen COPS but without cars or radios theyre
reduced to old-fashioned crowd control which ia not much Also
A FEW PHOTOGRAPHERS amateur andor press using non-digital
cameras and a NEWS CREW cursing its useless video equipment

Ray joins a couple guys at the edga of the group JULIO and
VINCENT They all know each other

RAY
I should have known you two were behind
this

VINCENT

God is pissed off at this neighborhood
Raymond I will tall you that much

JULIO
You see it

RAY
Yeah You got power over where you are

VINCENT
Nope No phone nothin’

RAY
fhe cars though is the thing You
know

JULIO
Solar flare Thats what this dude ovor
there told ma he heard

RAY
Solar flare

JULIO
Yeah ho says the sun shoots off these
big blobs of plasma they turn into
solar flares Its the only thing that
can kill all the electronic stuff like
that

VINCENT
I got news for you Julio the sun
doesnt make lightning okay

JULIO
Im saying what the guy said he heard

Ray keops walking leaving this important scientific debate
bobind 30

Ea reaches the actual crack in the macadam and bends down to
investigate for himself A fow othars are there too running
their handa over the edges of it

The crack is charred all along its edges and rimmed with big
chunks of what looks like broken glass Ray picks one up and
looks at it in the light -- its similar to glass but not quite
He touches the edges and theyre soft but when he bangs the
thing on the conerate it doesnt break

Weird Ray reaches down to run his hand over the other chunks of
whatever-it-is but as he touches the edge of the crack a
strange lcok crosses his face He lifts his hand off Puts it on
again

Be looks at the GUY next to him who is studying the damaged
street as well

RAY
Feel that

The Guy puts his hands down flat against the edge of the crack A
leok crosses his face Whatever it is he feels it too

Ray looks up There‘s a parking meter a few feat away from hin
He studies it

Its trembling
Ever so slightly

Ray looks back down As he watches a few small chunks of asphalt
break off the edge of the crack and fall inside

Ray stands up shoving the piece of “broken glass” into his
pocket

RAY (cont’d)
It‘s moving

CRACK

Ray whirls around Behind him the sound of CRACKING glass has
penetrated the still air

Ho looks at the house on the corner 4 narrow row house like his
fhe front picture window has cracked right down the middle The
Crowd starts to SHOUT in alarm (SEE APPENDIX 8)

CRACK CRACK CRACK

Ray whirls Directly across the street the picture windows of
several houses there are splitting as well

CONTIBUED 30

The crowd which had gone silent is starting to MURMUR and
CHATTER when suddenly --

-- avaryone near the crack in the pavement is thrown to the
ground

Bow there are some SCREAMS It‘s especially voxing because only
those in a roughly cireuler area around the orack itself were
thrown off their feet Everyone outside the circular area is
still standing

Rays on the ground but he looks up between the legs of those
around him who are scrambling to gat out of there and he sees
that parking meter again

Except now it’s in the middle of the street

The other parking meters are still where they wero in a neat
line on tha sidewalk but this one looks as if it has somehow
migrated out into traffic

Pulling up above Ray wa see the sidewalk no longer follows a
straight line neither the street or the edges of the front
yards A huge circular section of this neighborhood has suddonly
twisted three feet counter-clockwise throwing everything out of
line

There is great concern but not quite panic

Until the earthquake starts that is Because as Ray climbs to
his feet that entire circle starts to rotate again like a big
turntable causing tremors that ripple out from its center
spiderwebbing the pavement and sidewalks like ica in the
springtime

The houses at the edges of the circle are ripping apart right
down the middle their facades tearing away revealing cutavays
of the houses’ interiors

Ray buffeted by the crowd as it flees the epicenter comes eye
to eye with that rogue parking meter again Its rattling
violently as it rotates around the edge of the circle spitting
coins from the door in its front which has sprung open

A POOLISH GUY moves along with it scooping up tho coins

Ray bolts to the edge of the circle which is now plainly marked
by the ruptures mado by its rotation Everybody clears it
moving to the edges like soap flakes in a water glass

The rotation stops

People stop 30

Bverything stops
Silence for a second

Those who still remain stare into the middle of the perfect
eircle which is now empty

Ray looks at Vincent and Julio who are standing next to hin
Bobody knows what to aay They leok to tha adge of the road at
the now-cutaway facades of the houses see a WOMAN in her
upstairs bedroom staring in disbelief at her new view of the
street

Okay the buildup’s over Suddenly ond with such force that wo
feel completely unprepared the center of the crack heaves up
into the air spewing dirt rock and asphalt in all directions

Whats loft of the crowd surges backwards away from it which is
gocd because the geyser of earth that shoots out of the ground
is powerful and voluminous Water mains SHAP like toothpicks
sending geysers of water billowing into the air

But still much of the crowd stays to gawk standing in half-
fascinated terror

Ray and those around him are knocked into the air and land hard on
their backs in the street He sits up but it’s hard to see
anything clearly theres dirt and water in the air and the
earthquake is still going on everything is jarred shaking but
the one thing he gets a good look at --

- is the leg

Long spindly mechanical it claws up ont of the torn earth and
SMABHES down into the pavement just in front of hin

Its followed by a second leg and a third long seeningly-
metallic tubes three feet in diameter telescoping in the
otrangest manner weve aver seen they seam to both expand and
collapse simultancously as if the metal were flowing in and
out over itself in continual flux

As each of the threo logs plants itself at equidistant points
around the circumference of the circla a bevelled pad irises out
of the bottom and claws into the sarth stabilizing itself

Then as ons the three legs WHIR to life and exert pressure
Prem the center of the hole in the street the earth-
amaared squarish hulk of something rines out of the ground

It rests there on the surface for a moment as if the long climb
out of the ground has exhausted it 30

Two portholes iris open on the sida facing us they look like
eyes on a face Something rotates within them as if the thing is
looking both ways

Then the powerful legs kick in again and it begins to rise
shoved aloft by its tripartite base up into the air ten feet
twanty fifty a hundred

Finally it stops resting at the top of its fully extended legs
hovering there like a giant head on a pair of shoulders peering
down at the utterly thunderstruck humans beneath it

In this way the first of the Tripods appears It stands thero a
black silhouette against the sun setting just behind it Its
strange though this thing is clearly hyper-advanced in some
ways it looks ancient full of stress marks and woathering like a
relic thats just been dug out of the sands

Whatever semblance of calm there was before is utterly gone now
whoover was left in the crowd backs off as far and as fast as they
can

But there are those whose curiosity prevails and Ray is one of
them He falls back with a group of a half dozen into --

THE MOUTH OF AN ALLEY 31
-- maybe sixty or seventy yards away from the Tripod They

strain for a look shielding their eyes against tho sun which is
blinding behind the thing

Guy 1
WHAT IS IT

RAY
JEs8Us

Guy 2
JESUS CHRISTI

Guy 1
WHAT IS IT

RAY

ITS MOVING

fruo anough seen from thair point of view wa seo the entire
Tripod shudder as if it just took a mouthful of hard liquor
This movement shakes the last of the remaining dirt and rock from
it they fall to the street and SMASH

The thing just stands there again unwoving Suddenly with a
sharp HI8S several vapor clouds shoot out of ports on the sides
as if the thing is breathing

31

And a fat spray of water bursts from its undercarriage as if
its taking a loak on the straet

What the hell is it

Ray looks around Half the crowd is creeping forward again not
out in the open of course but in the mouths of alleys and
driveways behind cars in doorways half-sheltered groups of
four and five staring opan-mouthed at the apparition

In the street there is no one no sound

Except for a CLICK-CLICK-CLICK from across the street A
PHOTOGRAPHER steps from his hiding placa between two houses and
moves into the street

Prom the side of the Tripod a thin black whip emerges maybe six
feet long snakelike It stiffens and unfolds something flat and
round from inside the head of the Tripod

A SECOND PHOTOGRAPHER joins the first they move out into an open
area to get better shots of the Tripod

The flat round thing pivots upward and it looks somathing like
a small satellite dish except its perfectly polished its
surface brilliant and mirror-like

RAY (cont’d)
Get out of there Are you crazy get-

He starts to go after the Photographers but a BIG GUY next to him
grabs him by the collar and pulis him back

In the street the mirrored disk turns ever so slightly trailing
the Photographers as thay make their way into the open just
watching them apparently it means them no harm

Ray breathes a small sigh of relief

Now emboldaned by the first two Photographers HALF A DOZEN
AMATEURS move into the street bearing handheld videos flash
cameras and the like

The flashes FLASH strobing the block

Immediately the mirrored disk pivots in their direction what
looks like a glint of sunlight flashes over it for the briefest
of seconds --

-- and the Photographers simply evaporate their bodies turned to
dust leaving their clothes floating in midair

32 38

Ray blinks he cant even register whats just happened it was
so fast one second ago two men were walking into the street and
now theyre no they dont even exist anymore all flesh is
nothing but blowing dust now as their empty clothes waft to the
ground

Bow the full-fledged panic that has been building in the crowd
hits at last Everyone takes off bolting from their hiding
Place SCREAMING in terror

Rather than tear ass into the opon with the others Ray remains
bohind the corner of the building --

RAY (contd)
WAIT DONT-

-- but those around him bolt and his desperate grab cant hold
anyone back The sudden movament of the crowd causes the Tripod
head to snap into action It pivots quickly seeming to brace
itself and the mirrored disk rotates sweeping once across the
street in a slow arc

fhe air betweon the disk and the material objects on the ground
wavers heat ripples like off the highway on a summer day and
slowly averything before it is incineratad

So swift and terrible is the heat rays destruction that before
Ray can even back away it’s nearly upon him wiping out thea
building hes hiding behind

Roy bolts into the street just ahead of the heat ray Behind
him a FORTYISH GUY runs in terror in the same direction toward
the safety of another building just ahead

Ray reaches the building first and lunges around the corner
flattening himself against the building He reaches out for the
Fortyish Guy and gets hold of his hand just as the heat ray
reaches that part of the street it flashes Ray tries to pull
the man to safety he gets the Guys arm around the corner --

just as the deadly heat hits him

Ray pulls the arm but thats all thats left of the Guy by the
time it comes around the corner Ray SCREAMS and looks back in
horror toward the Tripod As ho watches -

-- its legs suddenly telescope vaulting tho thing another fifty
feet up into the air but thats not all now up at this new
height the horrible thing --

e- takes a step forward 31

It can move As it begins to stride forward the heat ray flashes
again SEARING into the side of the brick building Ray is hiding
behind

As the brick begins to glow Rays attention is caught by a
FATHER in one of the split-apart houses racing down the stairs
holding one SMALL CHILD and dragging another KID by the hand

Rays eyes widen remembering the kids and he takes off down
the narrow alley and over a chain-link fence at the other end
disappearing into the smoke and haze

Ist RAYS HOUSE DAY 36

BANG Ray covered in ash SLAMS through the front door and
staggers into the kitchen He gets there and turne in 4 half
eirele traumatized not sure where to go or what to do is legs
go out from under him and he collapses crosslegged on the
kitchen floor

Robbie and Rachel are visible through the open back door staring
ever the tree line at the mayhem in the distance They hear hin
and come into the house

ROBBIE
What happened

Ha doesnt answer

RACHEL
Are you okay

and8till no answor

RACHEL (cont ‘d)
Dad Whats the matter

ROBBIE

Ray gets up and turne to the sink catches sight of himself in a
mirror hanging there His face is covered in gray ash

RACHEL
Whats all that smoke outside Whats
going on out there

Ray runs water and splashes it over his faca washing off the
ash The cold seems to bring him back to life

36

ROBBIE
Rey Hello

Ray turns back to them

RAY
Ware getting out of there

He goas across the room finds Rachels American Girl suitcase
and RIPS it open He starts tossing aside school folders dolls
anything not absolutely necessary He finds a sweater shoves
that back inside Also grabs another coat hanging from a rack
on the wall and shoves that in

ROBBIE
What Why Whats going on

Ray grabs a loaf of bread and a couple apples off the counter and
shoves them into the suitcase SNAPS it shut He slides it
across the flcor to Rachel it hits her feet and stops

RAY
Take that and go wait by the front door

RACHEL
Where are we going

Ray picks up a cardboard box next to the trash can its full of
paper for the recyoling He dumps the contents onto the floor
and shoves the empty box into Robbies arms

RAY
fake anything edible in the refrigerator
and put it in this box plus the canned
stuff from the cupboards

ROBBIE
What ‘s-

Do what I said
(Robbie hesitates)
Row

Robbie sees the look in Rays eyes sees enough to know something
very very bad has happened He moves

Ray opens a drawer and takes out a flashlight He tries it but
it’s dead 36

Rachel still puzzled goes to the coffee table and picks up the
third-place ribbon the one she was trying to get her father to

notice before She puts it in her pocketRay rips open a fresh

pack of batteries and dumps them in the flashlight

RAY (cont ‘d)
Were leaving this house in sixty
seconds

Ray tries the flashlight again now it works and he tosses it in
the box He turns and runs up the stairs

Rachel confused and alarmed notices something out the open
front door She walks over to it and stands in the doorway

Outside TWO MEN run past their house at top speed Rachel
watches thinks it weird Their street which was perfectly
peaceful thirty seconds ago is showing the first signs of alara
but its not yet widespread

Tat RAYS BEDROCM DAY 37

Ray runs into his bedroom drops to the floor noxt to the bed and
pulls a metal box from underneath It has a set of three tumblers
in the top He spins them to enter a three-digit code and opens
the box which is a gun safe

Inside is a 38 and a box of bullets He dumps the bullets in his
pocket puta the gun in his waistband and runs out

Int KIDS‘ BEDROOM DAY 38
Ray grabs Robbies backpack from off the bed

OMITTED 39
EXT RAYS HOUSE DAY 40

Ray followed by the kids BANGS through the front door of the
house There is a good deal more commotion in the street than two
minutes ago but on a scale of one to ten the panic level is
still at a five The first bits of news have coma back about the
fxipod attack by word-of-mouth but the full tide of news is just
about to hit

Ray drags Rachel up the sidewalk in the direction that HALF A
DOSEN SURVIVORS seem to be fleeing Robbie follows at a half-
trot carrying the cardboard box of food

ROBBIE
What happened

40

RAY
Cant tell you now we only got another
minute

Ray looks ahead to the gas station on the corner where Manny
SLAMS the hood of the car he was repairing which is now running
Manny sees Ray coming and calls out to him

MANNY
Hey Ray You were right Had to change
the solenoid tool
(to the Mechanic)
Leave it on run the alternator

The Mechanic who was behind the wheel gots out leaving the car
running Ray quickly forms a plan and he leads the kids quickly
toward the idling oar

Manny is at the corner about ten feet away talking vith the
Mechanic noticing the strange behavior of a few people in the
street wondering whats going on

Ray Robbie and Rachel reach the car

RAY
(quietly to the kids)
Get in

RACHEL
Whose car is-
RAY
(hisses)
Get ini

They do Robbie in the front passenger seat Rachel in the back
Ray slides behind the wheel

Ray SLAMS the door Manny and the Mechanic both turn at the
sound

RAY
Leek your doors

They do Ray hits the window up buttons and the power windows
start to alide up as Manny turns and looks at Ray an odd smile
on his face

He extends his hands -- “whats the joke

Suddenly and silently right behind Manny -

- a maple tree bursts into flame

This is seen from inside the car which perhaps makes it even
more stunning and horrific

The kids can only stare in stunned horror but Ray drops the car
in gear hits the gas and cranks the wheel

The car spins a one-cighty in the parking lot cutting around
Manny who has fallon back from the trae in horror His Mechanic
takes off running but in the wrong direction straight out into
the street toward the approaching chaos

At the adge of the driveway Ray SLAMS on the brakes reaches in
back and throws open the rear passenger door

He SCREAMS at Manny

RAY (cont’d)
GET IN

Manny is standing in dumb terror looking up at the trea at the
fleeing people and at Ray

RAY (contd)
GET IN MANNY OR YOU ARE GOING TO DIB

These are words Rachel has never ever heard spoken in earnest
She starts to SCREAM

Manny has a two-second window here to adjust to the new reality
or cling to his old one and --

he clings snapping out of his stupor with a look of fury

MANWY
Get the hell out of that car

Wrong answer and theres no more time for the right one Ray
hits the gas and the car SCREECHES out of the parking lot
leaving the furious Manny behind SHOUTING at them --

-- until he is incinerated by the heat ray His gas station busts
into flame

Again the kids begin SCREAMING but its hard to hear over the
racing engine the SCREECHING tires

Ray leans forward trying like hell to sae through the
windshield through the smoke thats now blanketing the block

On the other side of the freeway a DOSER POLICE CARS and FIRE
TRUCKS race through the stilled traffic there headed in the
direction Ray and the kids just came from (Apparently those
vehicles aro either still working or have been repaired)

The SCREAMING SIRENS are deafening as they blast past In the

ROBBIE
What the hell is going on

speaks softly to Rachel in what seems a practiced routine she
starts to calm down

grabs hold of his belt to keep a hand on him

In front Robbie leans in closer to his father lowers his voice
to a hushed whisper

ROBBIE (contd)

RAY
The machine Im talking about is what
was buried what came down had to be
what brought then up brought up

Ray just looks at him cant bring himself to actually say “an
alien” Robbie returns the look for a long puzzled moment then
suddenly understanding breaks across is face and he grasps what
his father is trying to tell him without saying

Robbie leans furthor forward and looks up out the front
windshield His eyes crawl up to search the skies

ROBBIE
Why aran’t there any helicopters Or
airplanes Where is everybody
Ray shrugs He leoks back at Rachel

RAY

The door opens at the head of a flight of wooden stairs and Ray

starts down the steps into the basement The kids follow him
carrying armloads of blankets and pillows

52

RACHEL
If everythings fine why do we have to
sleep in the basement We have
perfectly good beds

RAY
Think of it like camping out

ROBBIE
What are you afraid is gonna happen

RAY
(leoking around)
Who has a basement this nico

It is nice Theres a Stairmaster stretching machine other
workout stuff and a mirrored wall with free weights on racks

Ray finds a likely corner and dumps the blankets and pillows

RACHEL
I want to sleep in my bed I have back
problems

RAY

(getting exasperated)
Look you know on the Weather Channel
how when theres a tornado they tell
everybody to go down to the basement
For safety It’s like that

RACHEL
Theres gonna be tornadoes

Robbie rolls his eyes annoyed by his fathers mishandling of
her

ROBBIE
No more talking Lay down Rachel

He fluffs a couple pillows and Rachel lays down He lays down
beside her

Ray plugs a nightlight into a wall socket nearby then comes and
pulls a blanket up over Rachel she stares at him eyes wide

RAY
In the morning well see whats going
on Were safe here for tonight

ROBBIE
How do you know

as 52

RAY
Im gonna be right in this chair over
here

He turns and walks toward an old beat-up armchair under a window
one of those narrow top-of-the-basement windows that is right at
grass lovel On the way he bends down surreptitiously pulling
something from Robbies backpack which leans against the wall

Its the 38 he took from the gun safe under his bed Hiding it
behind one leg he turns and drops into the chair sliding the
gun batween the cushion and the arm of the chair within easy
reach

All of this he feels he has dono on the sly but when he settles
into the chair and looks up Rachel is staring right at hin

RACHEL
Dad
RAY
Yoah
RACHEL
am I ever going to sea Mom again in ny
life
RAY

Yes You are I promise

RACHEL
Toll me the other stuff

RAY
What other stuff

RACHEL
The stuff you don‘t want ms to know

He looks at her The kids too smart He moves closer sits down
on the floor next to her and tries his best

RAY
Never could bullshit you

RACHEL
You shouldn’t use that language in front
of me

RAY
Right right

He thinks How the hell do you explain this one

52 52

RAY (contd)
Well that that lightning storm it
made the power go out right I dont
know how but it stopped all the phones
and TV and most cars dont work Now
anothor thing the lightning did is it
seems like it made this machine come up
out of the earth And that machine
it it

RACHEL
It kills people

RAY
Yes it does

RACHEL
How did the machine gat down in the
earth

RAY
I dont know

RACHEL
Is there more than one machine

RAY
No Absolutely not I only saw one Im
sure of it

RACHEL
Well who were the people who put it
thero

RAY
Let me tell you something I know for
sure okay Wherever theyre from they
have done a very stupid thing I dont
know what they expected to find when
they got here maybe no life maybe
nothing at all Sut they found us And
they pissed us right off And right now
our army has found out about them and
they are very very angry and theyre
on their way this very minute to destroy
that machine and whatever is running it
And then everything in your life and
mine and Robbies is gonna go right
back to exactly the way it was before

Bhe looks at him for a long moment deciding whether or not to
believe that Apparently satisfied she rolls over facing away
from him and closes her eyes 32

Ray goes back to the chair and slouches into it breathes deeply
Hes about to close his eyes when Robbie rolls over ayes open
staring at his

Ray looks at him Robbie continues to stare In the background
we can see Rachel putting her arms out in front of her making
space like she did in the car with Robbie

RAY (cont‘d)
to Robbie a whisper)
What
ROBBIE

He died That guy Manny He died
(no answer from Ray)
You stole his car and now hes dead
RAY
Youre alive arent you

Robbie considers this his face neither condemning nor excusing
Jast thinking about the now reality

Ray breaks the eye contact pulls his Yankeas cap low over his
eyes and tries to gat some sleap

So ends the firat night

INT BASEMENT NIGHT 53
Or so wa thought It‘s later The kids are deeply asleep Ray
lightly se The nightlight glows in the socket on the other side
of the basement a big round clock TICKS on the wall

TICK TICK TICK

The narrow window over Rays head RATTLES lightly in its framo
shaken by the wind

Or is it the wind Because the window starts RATTLING harder
too hard for just wind

Rays eyes pop open He looks up at the pale moonlight coming
through the RATTLING window

Ray twists in his chair looks up at the window He gets up and
stretches to look out through it

THROUGH THE WINDOW
he sees the trees in the front yard bending from a heavy wind

53

Ray turns from the window thinking A hollow BOOM in the
distanca draws his attention back to the window and its
followed quickly by a second BOOM and then a third

RAY
Oh no

Outside the window there is a silent blinding flash of purple
light that illuminates the entire basement as if it were daytime
for a second

Both kids sit bolt upright

RACHEL
What is it Is it the lightning

RAY
I don’t know) I dont think so

Another purple flash brilliant and searing it lights up the
entire basement for a split-second and its followed closely by
a tremendous BOOM

ROBBIE
Whats that sound

RACHEL
Is it them Is it them

They start to get up but --

RAY
Stay down

Ray throws himself on them and they huddle into a corner

The BOOMS grow louder and the purple flashes hot and irregular
continue to flash into the basement through the window

But this time another sound rises up over everything this one’s
like the SCREAM of an engine

It starts out loud and gets louder deafening a HARSH METALLIC
SHRIEKING sound that is absolutely the loudest thing weve ever
heard in our lives and its building and building and building
like a bomb about to fall right on top of us On the far wall of
the basement the rack of free weights starts trembling tipping
Spilling weights that SLAM onto the floor around them 3

Ray and the kids are SHOUTING and SCREAMING at each other but ve
cant hear a word of it and it sounds like that bomb is going to
be right on top of us in a few seconds

Ray SCREAMS something we cant understand to Robbie gesturing
urgently Robbie SHOUTS back points to the other side of the
basement

Ray leaps to his feet dragging Rachel with him gesturing for
Robbie to go quickly Understanding Robbie leads them all
across the basement further in toward a meatal door on the far
side he throws open the door --

ryt MACHINE ROOM NIGHT 54

- and theres a staircase down and then another door at the
bottom of it a fire door he opens that one tco and they all fall
into a deep windowless room lit only by the flashing lightning
coming through the open doors We get just a glimpse of the
inside of this sub-basement its full of pipes and tanks and the
other junk that runs a house then both the inner and outer doors
SLAM were inside and in total darkness and --

I8 TOTAL BLACK 55
-- the bomb hits

The explosion above and around them is so bono-rattling and so
close that we practically lose our hearing for a minute

It settles but were still in darkness

Long moments go by Outside there are diminishing THUNKS and
BOOMS as the residual explosions from whatever happened outside
begin to fade

Paintly we can hear fire But that starts to fade too Until we
ean only hear the breathing of three people

Breathing Silence Still black Finally
RACHEL

a whisper)
Are we still alive

INT SUB-BASEMENT DAY 56

The next morning not that wed know -- the screen is still
black (Were going for a record for on-scraon blackness here)

5

56

We hear the sound of someone waking up A rapid intake of breath
8 jerking sound a GRUNT Its Ray At first terror hes lost
in darkness where the hell is he

Peet SCRAPE ha must be gotting up He fumbles around searching
the walls with his hands His hands fall on a doorknob he turns
and pushes it open

Now narrow atreams of light fall into the machine room Wa see
Robbie and Rachel are still asleep slumped over in the corners

Ray finds something to prop open the door and looks up the short
flight of stairs that leads to the basement Theres daylight
coming around the edges of the door at the top of the stairs

Without waking the kids he climbs the short flight of stairs and
turns the knob He pushes

But tho door won’t open He leans up against it puts his
shoulder into it and forces it open about two feet which is all
it will give

Immediately he winces from the brilliant daylight but why is
there brilliant daylight in the basement His eyes adjust and he
realizes --

EzT RUIWED BASEMENT DAY Ss

-- the entire house has been wrenched right off its moorings
What once was the basement is now wreckage the only thing left
intact is the staircase that leads up to the ground floor oddly
spared in whatever catastrophe occurred here last night

Overhead blue sky

Stunned Ray picks his way through the wreckage and climbs the
basement stairs which lead up to ground level

EXT RUINED HOUSE DAY 58

Ray reaches the top of the stairs and stands in the ruins of the
house Its not so much that the house was torn down more that
it was sheared off its foundation as if something reached down
and swiped it away

Were looking at Ray but somethings obstructing our vision
something turning spinning in front of us

All around thick black smoke wafts through the air and as 4
breeze picks up it parts revealing to Ray the source of the
deafening explosion they heard last night and finally wo

understand the apocalyptic sounds we heard were caused by --

se

-- the crash of a 747

fhe entire tail section nearly intact is buried in tho house
across the street which has bean decimated We pull back and
realize the thing spinning slowly in front of us is the turbine
of one of the engines turned slowly by the morning breeze

Wreckage is everywhere the entire row of houses across the
street wiped out either by the crash or the resulting fire and
the debris field extends a hundred yards in all directions

There dont appear to be any survivors either from the plane or
in the nearby homes an unearthly quiet has fallen over the
neighborhood

It appears the plane came in low right over this side of the
street Clipping this house and the one beside it then crashed
on the other side

But seme things were cddly spared fhe screen porch still
intact A bicycle leaning against a tree The stolen car still
in the driveway thank God

Like a sleepwalker Ray stumbles forward crosses what used to be
the street in the direction of the wreckage

He stops short next to an upright row of seats five across from
the coach cabin There ara no corpses in them but the seat belts
are all torn the hodies ripped free

Ray looks around He calla out

RAY
Hello)
(no answer)
Anybody
(still nothing)
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME7

He turns around and nearly jumps out of his skin as he sees a MAH
bent ovor right behind him facing away The guys about forty
his shirt’s soaked in blood and hes using a crowbar to try to
pry open a smashed and twisted food cart He clutches a bandana
over his mouth to keep out the smoke and stench of the burning jet
fuel

RAY (contd)
Jesus are you all right Were you on
the plane

The guy doesnt answer just keeps prying at the cart 58

RAY (cont’d)
I said are you all-

Ray walks forward and puts a hand on the guys shoulder and the
man whirls fast brandishing the crowbar

VOICE (08
Hes deaf

Ray turns and sees a TV HEWS VAN thats pulled up onto the curb

The back doors are open and a NEWS PRODUCER a young woman around
thirty or so is sitting there shell-shocked Her clothes are
torn and burned and shes got a bandana over her mouth too
which she moves only when shes speaking to Ray

BREWS PRODUCER
A shell went off right beside him
Camera on his shoulder saved his life
(shouting)
You hear that Max Your stupid camera
saved your stupid life

Max goes back to prying open the food cart

Ray chokes gagging from the fumes She tosses him her bandana
(which he takes and uses throughout the scene)

NEWS PRODUCER (cont ’d)
fake this one Im used to it

RAY
Thanks Where were you

She points behind them to the west where a line of smoka rises
on the horizon

NEWS PRODUCER
Out there in the Pine Barrens We were
attached to a National Guard unit the
3rd Mechanized They moved on one of
those things around midnight Theyve
got some kind of shield around ‘em you
cant see it but everything we fire at
them detonates too early before it gets
close enough to do any damage Then
they flash that that thing and
everything lights up like Hiroshima

RAY
(xealising with horror)
Theres more than one
s8

58A 58

She gives him a look

HEWS PRODUCER
Aro you kidding

Int NEWS VAN DAY 56A

BAM The sliding side door of the news van SLAMS open and
daylight spills into its half-wrecked but still functioning
interior There‘s shit scattered everywhere theyve boan
driving thie thing like maniacs but the twin walls of electronic
equipment still appear intact

The News Producer climbs in Ray stands just outside She talka
fast as she sorts through piles of three quarter inch videotapes
pushing a few of them into machines

WEWS PRODUCER
Thore’s a jot more than one

She hits play on the first machine and a jerky low-resolution
night-vision image comas up on the screen Ray peers closely at
it Its a battlefield theres fire and explosions everywhere
shot with a very long lens from far away but in a brief momant of
noar-clarity you can juat barely make out the tall spindly
shapes that dominate the field

Tripods Half a dozen of them

NEWS PRODUCER (contd)
We were feading New York but Hew York
went dark so wa patched over to DC
and they want down

Ray peers closar Theres an enormous amount of static and
interforence in the shot but thore are flashos when wa can just
make out whats going on -- the Tripods are marching through a
city somewhere maybs downtown Hewark But whenevor the image
becomes clear enough to give us a good look the interference
wipes it out again

NEWS PRODUCER (cont’d)
LA Chicago we uplinked to London
even called affiliates to try to get
them to catch the feed but nobody
answers

On the scrsen a skyline is visible its definitely Newark but
then theres an enormous amount of interference and when the
image clears --

-- the skyline is gone replaced by a smoldering valley
7
58A SA

NEWS PRODUCER (cont‘d)
Its the same everywhere - once the
Tripods start to move no more news
comes out of that aroa

Outside there is an EXPLOSION in the distance The Cameraman
SHOUTS at them from outside

CAMERAMAN (0S)
We cant stay here

The Producer hits play on the next machine and Ray moves in close
to the screan Now its shaky hand-held footage from right down
in the thick of the battle this must be how Max lost his hearing

RAY
My God

NEWS PRODUCER
You aint seen nothin yet

She hits “play” on a third recorder and another screan comes to
life It looks like a mistake at first it’s just brilliant
blinding flashes that blank out the screen

RAY
Thats one of the lightning storms I
was in one of those I saw this

NEWS PRODUCER
You didnt see it like this Those
things the Tripods they come up out of
the ground right so that means they
must have buried ‘em here a long time
ago But whos driving the God damn
things Look

She slows the image on screen down to a crawl allowing us to look
closely at one lightning bolt in particular Theres something
in it an object of some kind a thing

RAY
What is that

NEWS PRODUCER
That is Them

Another EXPLOSION in the distance but slightly closer
Remembering Ray takes the shard of burnt-glass from his pocket

the one he picked up earlier He stares at it thinking Its
got some structure to it like the bottom of a Coka bottle
sa
58A S6A

Like it was made or forged it’s not a natural shape He looks
from it to the screen things come together in his head

RAY
Theyre in some kind of capsule They
come down in the lightning thay ride it
down

NEWS PRODUCER
(finishing his thought)
Into the ground into the machines And
once they activate them-

A third EXPLOSION cuts her off as if to finish her thought but
this ones enormous and REALLY close It rocks the van hard
almost knocking them off their feet raminding them theyre still
dn a war gone

The Camoraman races past Ray -—

CAMERAMAN
Ware getting the hell outta here

-- rips open the drivar’s door and jumps inside He starts it up
and guns the engine The News Producer SHOUTS to Ray over the
ROARING engine
WEWS PRODUCER
Hey wait a second were you on this
plane

RAY
Ro

The Cameraman drops the car in gear and hits the gas
HEWS PRODUCER
(as thea van rolls
Too bad Woulda been a hell of a story

She SLAMS tha sliding door and the van tears away

EgT THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE DAY 68
Theyve moved substantially further north theyre now in

out and pulled his door shut hard

RAY
Hot so fast

ROBBIE
I gotta go

RAY

We got two things to watch for and the
second is people who might want our car

ROBBIE
Theres nobody around

Ray takes a long lock around The land is reasonably flat you
can see pretty far in all directions He relents takes his hand
off Robbies arm

Robbie bolts out of the car MUTTERING under his breath

ExT LONELY INTERSECTION DAY 70
A few moments later Ray opens the trunk and takes out a gas can

Though the car is still running he unscrews the gas cap and
upends the can into the tank

70

Off to the right there is a tree line about fifty yards away
Though Robbie has stopped short of it to go to the bathroon
Rachel is walking towards it

RAY
calling out)
Rachel Right thera is fine

She keeps walking calls back over her shoulder

RACHEL
Im not going in front of you guys

She keeps walking toward the tree line

Ray watches for a moment thinking He looks around They
certainly are alone He looks over tha roof of the car at Rachel
whos nearing the trea line now

RAY
Stay where I can see you

Rachel shouts something back but he can’t understand her she
steps into the treas

EXT wooDs DAY n

Rachel enters the woods at the edge of the field Looking around
here you wouldnt dream theres anything unusual going on in the
world -- trees sunlight birds rabbits skipping through the
underbrush

Rachel looks all around finds a likely spot and is about to go
to the bathroom when she hears a sound Sshe turns

Nothing threatening just rushing water A river She walks a
few steps more and looks through a stand of trees Beyond she
ean see the Hudson River moving past

The sunlight dapples off its moving surface It‘s enticing she
moves through a stand of trees and comes out --

Ext RIVERS EDGE DAY 72
-- on its banks Its beautiful She looks upriver It bends to
the left just about fifty yards away Rachel sees something
float around the bend something large and dark

Rachels oyes widen and she froozes as the strong current pulls
the something right past her

Its a dead body floating face down in the rivor

72

Rachel stares at it transfixed as it moves inexorably past her
It‘s a man or it was in a business suit but that’s not what
catches her attantion Its his hand which is still clampod
ento a leather briefcase the fingers locked around the handle in
a death grip

It passes and Rachel lets out a breath of relief At least its
gone She turns to look back upriver --

- and sees Aundreds of bodies float around tho bend in the
river bobbing swiftly toward her like a huge dead army

She SCREAMS and turns to run but theres a MAN behind her he
grabs her roughly she SCREAMS louder --

-- before realising that its her father

RAY
I said satay where I can see you

RACHEL
Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry

Ray looks up just as the logjam of corpses moves past them He
turns his daughter around away from the carnage and she burics
her face in his stomach

cur TO
EXT THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE DAY 73

Tho three of them como out of the field and are returning to the
car when Ray stops suddenly holding up a hand fhe kids stop
look at him questioningly

What is that

In the distance a low RUMBLING sound is rising up It gets loud
fast REALLY loud They all turn toward a rioo in tho road and
the RUMBLING around them becomas almost deafening as --

-- AN ARMY CONVOY ROARS OVER THE RIGE IN THE ROAD

Tho three of them stare in wonder from the side of the road as an
entire mechanized battalion passes them by a column that seams
to go on forever Tanks Bradley fighting vehicles Humvee after
Humvea dozens of armored personnel carriers its an awesome
display of military might

73

Robbie runs alongside them and waves like a madman SCREAMING the
unprintable things he wants them to do to the invaders
thankfully lost under the noise Ray runs after him grabbing
him and pulling him back

ROBBIE
Let GO of me

RAY
What are you suicidal

Robbie tears away and keeps up with the convoy Ray pursues him
and both of them SHOUT over the noise of the passing trucks

ROBBIE
I know where Im going I dont need
you

As a tank rolis past him Robbie makes eye contact with one of the
SOLDIERS riding on top of it his head and shoulders protruding
from the hatch Hes not much older than Robbie himself mayba
nineteen years old

Robbie stares star struck as the Young Soldier passes He
gxabs hold of a handle on the back of the tank it almost pulls
him over A SOLDIER shouts at him

SOLDIER
Watch it kid youre gonna get hurt

Ray grabs hold of Robbie and pulls him roughly away from the
convoy stopping him by the side of the road

RAY
You know what the sixteen year old
hardass routine is gettin’ a little
tired I know whats back in that
direction believe ma anybody who stuck
around to find out for themselves is
dead Im not gonna let that happen to
youl

In the background we see Rachel start to pursue then

ROBBIE
What do you care Por real you never
gave a shit before why start now

RaY
Okay you win whats your plan Cone

ROBBIE

those soldiers hook up with whoever
else isnt dead and we get back at ‘en

RAY
Yeah now lets try one that doesnt
involve your ten year old sister joining
the army You got anything like that

Theyre still moving and in the background we can see Rachel
running now racing toward then

ROBBIE
Why dont you just tell us the truth
You have no idea which way to go You
wanna come off all wise and shit but
you only picked Boston because you think
Mom is there and if we find Mom you can
dump us on her and youll only have to
worry about yourself which is exactly
the way you like it Admit it Ray at
least Ill respect you

The convoy ROARS away a cloud of dust receding on the horison as
the convoy fades away to the south

Rachel whos nearly hysterical catches up to Ray and Robbie and
SLAMS into Robbie hitting him with balled-up fists

RACHEL
Dont you leave ma dont you do that
Dont you ever do that to mal

ROBBIE
Rachel stop hey ow

RACHEL
You cant leave you cant just run
away Whos going to take care of me if

This more than anything makes Robbie feel terrible

ROBBIE
Im sorry Rachel Im sorry

He picks her up and carries her back toward the car murmuring
softly to her to calm her down

And you know it doesnt make Ray feel any tco good either He
watches his kids walk away from him feels horrible Worthless
73° 73

Robbie looks back over his shoulder He and Ray make oye

contact then Robbie goes back to comforting Rachel perhaps a

bit more tenderly than he even needs to

Ray takes a deep breath and follows them

The car and its three occupants keep moving north on another two-

fall Rachel in back has fallen asleep In the front Rays
eyes are droopy

Robbie is back to obsessively tuning the radio but the digital
numbers just whiz around and around the dial not even finding
anything to stop on

Until suddenly it stops way up on the dial 1086

He smacks his father in the shoulder and Rays eyes pop open He
looks around wild-eyed disoriented

RAY
What is it

ROBBIB
People Everywhere

He slows to sixty More people Now to fifty Not because
Robbie wants to go slower just to avoid hitting tham

76

RAY
Let me drive
(Robbie brakes)
Dont stop Keep the car moving hold
your speed just slide over

He climbs over the back of the seat and comes around to behind the
drivers seat Rachel feels the movement on the seat in front of
her and wakes up blinking in confuaion

RACHEL
What are you doing

RAY
Just goofin Go back to sleep

Robbie slides over in front now driving with his left hand his
left foot on the gas Ray slips over the back of the drivers
seat and back behind the wheel

KA-THUNK The door locks CHUNK down Ray slips his seat beit
over his shoulder as he makes his way through the growing crowd

RAY (contd)
Put yours on

Rachel leans forward between the seats

RACHEL
Where is everybody going

RAY
They dont know

RACHEL
But we do right

RAY
Yeah We do

fhe crowds growing marching toward a bottleneck up ahead And
the working motor vehicle is arousing a lot of interest

Ray slows even more down to thirty-five
THUNK

Somebody has SMACKED the hood of the car with a backpack in
frustration as they drive past

RACHEL
Whyd he do that 76

RAY
He just wants a ride that’s all

RACHEL
Can we give him one

RAY
Sit back Rachel Put on your seat
belt

The crowd is really thickening now the car slows to maybe twenty
miles an hour and even that feels too fast given the muddy
conditions Ray clamps both hands on the wheel

ROBBIE
Be careful

RAY
I an

A CRASY GUY lunges in front of the car waving his arms but Ray
snaps the wheel to the right and fishtails around him slipping
on the wet pavament but managing to keep it on the road

ROBBIE
Where are they going

RAY
The ferry probably its just up ahead
But were going all the way to the
bridge itll be wide open and its only
another-

CRASH

A boulder SMASHBS into the windshield spiderwebbing it Rachel
SCREAMS Ray and Robbie SHOUT in surprise and Ray immediately
twitches the wheel to the right and punches the gas

RAY (cont ‘d)
Bang on

He hauls the car onto the shoulder and takes it up to thirty or so
again he can move faster here and the crowd is staying mostly
out of his way except for the SHOUTS and JEERS and some pleading
CRIES

ROBBIE
DADI

RAY
I SEE IT 16

It is a tent that‘s set up on the side of the road thirty feet
ahead of them Ray has to swerve hard beck onto the road and
the crowd is gotting thicker and thicker new its all he can do
to pick his way through it without hitting anybody

Theyre getting angrier too FOUNDING on the car as it passes

But suddenly up ahead there is daylight a big gap in the
crowd and beyond that open road as they all seem to be moving
off to the right down an inoline that leads to the river

Ray‘s eyes light up he hits the gas hes twenty feet from wide
open road ten feet but just in front of him --

-- a guy pushes a WOMAN in front of the car

Ray SHOUTS cuts the wheel and slams on the brakes fhe car
spins but Ray has just barely enough control to somehow
miraculously cut a semi-circle around the Woman in the road

fhe ass end of the car spins all the way arcund the front and
SLAMS into a tree by the side of the road Ray SNACKS his head
off the drivers window Rebbie and Rachel are jostled but
unhurt and the car comes to a stop

Ray turns looks at them disoriented

RAY (contd)
Are you okay Are you guys-

Suddenly o GARG OF TEH descends on the car BANGING on tha
windows with their fists

RAY (contd)
GET THE HELL AWAY FROMN-

SMASH Somebodys got a rock and they hurl it through Rays
window Glass flies and he recoils his face flecked with blood
from tho flying shards

Hands reach in theyre all in the car all of a sudden Rays door
is unlocked and he is dragged out

ROBBIE
GET YOUR HAHDS OFF HIM

RACHEL
STOP IT STOP IT STOP Ivilt

Robbie throws his own door open and lunges into the thick of the
crowd to try to protect his father

BxT SIDE OF THE ROAD DUSK 7

The Gang of Ten (from all walks of life the only thing they have
in common is their desire to stay alive) drags Ray out of the car
and throws him to the ground across the road

The rain is really pouring down now Ray is face down in the md
with somebodys knee in his back no view of anything but feot
kicking up the road around him and the feading frenzy that is
currently taking place over his car

Robbie tries to get near him but somebody takes a swing and it
lands on the side of Robbie‘s face He crumples into the mud

RAY
Rachel Robbie

Somebody kicks him hard in the ribs and he coughs spits blood A
stick CRACKS onto the back of his neck and his face rakes across
the dirt

A VOICE in the background SCREAMS at them to stop it but we cant
sea who this decent person is and cant hear much over the
crowd

In the midst of taking a beating from his faceless human enemies
Ray manages to work his right hand free from underneath him Ha
snakes it around to behind his back he reaches up under his
shirt his fingers close around something --

-- and all at once he rolls over out from under the feet pulling
the 36 from the waistband of his pants

VOICE Gun

VOICE 2 HES GOT A GUN

The Crowd that had gathered over him parts ravealing the sky for
a momant and Ray PIRES A SHOT straight up over his head

The CRACK rolls out over the crowd and they part revealing his
car again Ray scampars to his feet

Rachol is still in the back seat MEN are swarming into the
front and Robbie who has fought to his feet is near the heod
fighting and kicking for all he‘s worth

RAY
Get away from the car
rei

nN
7

There is a response but it ian’t quick enough to suit Rays
taste cso he FIRES ANOTHER SHOT into the air

RAY (contd)
GET AWAY FROM TRE CAR

Yow the movement from the car is more panicked the Crowd moves
back soma putting their arma up in surrender others urging Ray
to calm down

But hes in control now hes got the situation in hand and all he
has to do is-

CLICK-CLACK
A loaded gun moves into frame pointed at Rays temple
A GUY IN A SUIT holds the weapon it’s cocked and loaded

GUY IN SUIT

RAY
My daughters in there

QUY IN SUIT
Put it down

RAY
ALL I WANT IS MY DAUGHTER

GUY IN SUIT
PUT THE GOD DAMN GUN DOWN OR I PULL THE
TRIGGER

The Crowd swirls and SHOUTS around him (SEE APPENDIX C)

Ray drops the gun in the mud its pounced on by several more of
the Gang and in the ensuing confusion Ray is able to leap
forward to the car (In tho background a guy in a BUS DRIVERS
uniform ends up with Rays gun)

At the car Ray reaches around the front seat and unlocks tha
rear door grabs hold of the petrified Rachel Immediately
hands are on hin and he is dragged away from tha cer again but
this time hes got a grip on Rachel

Ray and Rachel are pulled back away from the car and fall to the
road as the Guy in the Suit and two other LARGE pile into the
car They start the engine over the protests of some others in
the crowd 7

Arms locked tight around Rachel Ray falls over backwards He
turns and comes eyo to eye with his own handgun now held by tho
Bus Driver who has another eye on the car

Ray rolls over drags Rachel out of the mid and to her feet and
moves avay toward the incline that leads down to the river
below whore most of the crowd is headod

RAY
ROBBIE ROBBIE

ROBBIE

Robbie follows them they get just ten steps from the road their
stolen car (now stolen again) starts rolling but tha Bus Driver
steps calmly up to the drivers window and --

-- POP POP POP

fhe three men in the car are shot the doors flung opan theyre
dragged out and the car is once again swarmed over

Ext ON THE EMBANKMENT pDUsK 768

There are SCREAMS from the crowd of people swarming over the side
ef the road and down the embankment and now Ray Robbie and
Rachel are among them without transportation and without
provisions swept along on the tide of humanity down the hill

Ray is carrying Rachel she‘s hugging him tightly hysterical but
unhurt

ROBBIE
Where are we going

Up ahead they hear SCOTHING MUSIC wafting strangely through the
trees Tho people around them hear it too they all press
forward drawn

RAY
Were gonna be okay

ROBBIE
WHERE ARE WE GOING

RAY
Its there It‘s working SEB

Robbie looks ahead and our vision sweopsa that way too Down the
embankment theyre approaching the edge of the Hudson River and
thore moored at the dock its massive ENGINES HUMMING --

EXT FERRY LANDING NIGHT 73

-- is the Hadson Highland Ferry The rivers not terribly wide
at this point but its swift and dangerous Just a mile or two
to the north we can see the massive spans of the great bridge Ray
had hoped to make it to but without a car the ferry is now their
only hope to gat across

Night has fallen and the rain drissles to a stop The MUSIC they
heard is louder here played through the boats tinny speakers
perhaps to soothe the panicky crowd A FERRY WORKER is SHOUTING
to the crowd through cupped hands

FERRY WORKER
Please move forward calmly there is
room for everyone and the boat can make
more than one trip Please move
forward calmly

For the most part the message is gotting through The crowd is
huge but the boat is too and theres no real sense of urgency
The further they get downhill from the road the more the
shooting at the car is left behind then

As the crowd thickens they notice people holding up hand-drawn
fliers showing pictures of loved ones searching for the
missing Light poles are plastered with similar fliers and
since the powers out theyre all made by hand with real
photographs taped to then

A DINGING sound gets their attention and the crowd stops looking
around A set of railroad crossing barriers descends right in
front of them and looking down they realize a set of railroad
tracks runs between them and the ferry landing

The crowd leoks around waiting for the train to coma and it
arrives suddenly all at once barreling toward them at a hundred
miles an hour

And its on fire

A shocked silence falls over the crowd as the burning passenger
train flies past them a runaway flames spewing from every
window completely out of control No sign of life is visible
within and as quickly as it appeared it flies past then
rocketing around a bend in a puff of smoke

The gates rise and the crowd pushes toward the ferry again
m4

79A EXT ON THE DOCK NIGHT TOA

They reach the edge of the dock and step onto it Its tighter
hore the Crowd has to bottleneck a Little bit but people ara
still being cool about it The MUSIC is louder

RACHEL
fhe powers still on here

RAY
Looks like it MNothing came out of the
ground here

At the edge of the dock theres a Red Cross blood drive booth set
up its staffed by HALY A DOZEN VOLUNTEERS but theyre turning
crowds away

And it goes on as thay move past the booth Noarby them a GUY

WITH A TRARSISTOR RADIO has replaced the battery and got it

teeming again unfortunately theres nothing but STATIC all over
eo dial

We start in close on the dial as it twists through the stations
finding no information there Pulling up from it wa follow Ray
Rachel and Robbie as they move through the crowd down the
hillside toward the dock As they go they overhear murmurs
whisperings snatches of conversations the only information
anybody can glean about what exactly ig going on

OLDER MAH

UPSET MOTHER
Can you please not have this
conversation in front of the children

Ray notices Rachel whos vastly concerned by all the
conversations going on around them He draws hear attention

RAY
Rach Rachel look wa‘re getting on
the boat wa’re gonna make it

Rachel lifts her head off his shoulder and turns around seas
that they are indeed getting on the boat This seems to help

Ray kisses her on the forehead and wipes away her tears

RAY (cont’d)
Nothing bad is gonna happen to you I
promise Sweetie

Rachel nods calming Next to them a MOTHER carrying a THREE
YEAR OLD is feeding a cereal bar to him she notices Rachel
leoking at the bar She whispers in the Three Year Olds ear he
leoks up at Rachel too

The Mother takes the cereal bar breaks it in half and holds it
out to Rachel
T9A 79K

Rachel smiles and takes it Ray looks at the Mother grateful
almost overwhelmed by the tiny gesture He nods at her she
smiles back

Ray looks at Robbie who is naxt to him He gives him a wink
Robbie gring tightly exhales calming Theyve made it This
far anyway

Rachel turns back to rest her head on her fathers shoulder
chewing contentedly on the cereal bar A flock of seagulls flies
low over them and Rachels eyes follow them as they head up the
embankment

Sha sees something behind them and her eyes narrow
She lifts her head She cocks it sideways -- huh

Ray turns and does a double take looking at the crowd as he sees
a familiar face -- its the Bartender from the bar at the
beginning the woman in her late thirties Shes across tha
crowd from him maybe twenty yards clutching the hand of a NINE
YEAR OLD BOY

Ray waves a hand in surprised greeting she recognizes him and
smiles Ray starts to say something but ia interrupted by
Rachel --

RACHEL
The trees are funny

Shes looking back up the hill

Ray turns away from the Bartender to follow Rachels gaze Up
at the top of the embankment there is a row of tall trees the
forest runs all the way to the Highlands Road which is what they
drove in on

The seagulls are darting into the trees up on the highlands
which do indeed look funny They seem to be breathing a strange
mist emanating from inside themAnd theyre moving But moving
forward in a most un-trealike manner Three of them anyway

Rays face goes white fifty heads around him turn --
-- AND A TRIPOD STEPS OUT OF THE FOREST

For a moment absolutely averything stops no sound no movement
no nothing and the Tripod just stands there its head-like top
staring down at the crowd as it swarms toward the ferry boat
emanating clouds of vapor as it did in the street back in Rays
neighborhood

79K 792

Robbie and Rachel who never saw tha Tripod back on Rays block
stare at it horror-struck

The seagulls swarm around the head of the Tripod like moths
around a flame

On the dock panic hits Ray turns back to where the Bartender
was but all he sees is the whites of her wide-open eyes as she
and her son are swept away by the panicking crowd which surges
forward pushing to get onto the boat The Captain hits the
engines they ROAR

And the Tripod rather than imediately beginning the fight
turns its head slightly and emits an inhuman cry a MECHANICAL
BELLOW that rips over the landscape and echoes all the way scross
the river and washes back off the opposite bank

ULLA
OW THE DOCK 80

the crowd surges forward onto the boat Ray holding Rachel
winces in pain as he tries to keep her from being crushed

Rachel begins to panic and Ray makes a space around her with his
arms the way Robbie did in the car

RAY
This is your space you hear ma This
is your space nobodys coming in here
ZI will protect you

Robbie caught in the crush of people actually loses touch with
the ground his feet lift right up off the decking and he moves
forward as part of a massive organism no control at all

Ho SCREAMS for his father Ray SCREAMS back but theras nothing
they can do to stay near each other theyre lost in the flood

I8 THE RIVER 61

the massiva propellers of the forry boat CHURN the water as they
start to turn but theyre digging too hard in an area thats too
shallow and thoy throw up an enormous spray of mud and silt that
flies everywhere

The boat lurches forward throwing up a huge rooster tail of
rdver mud

The rear ramp of the ferry boat starts to riso up spilling
whoever was on it into the boat and blocking the way for whoever
was still on the dock

81

Paople leap off the edge of the dock grabbing onto the lip of the
rising ramp

ON THE FERRY BOAT 82

the still-tied aft ropes on the boat pull tight and with a
horrible GROAHING they rip the pilings out of the riverbed

The massive boat moves out fast a dozen people clinging to the
half-raised rear ramp suspended over the churning propellers

Robbie leaps forward onto the roof of the rearmost car and gots
himself up near the top of the ramp He hauls people onboard one
after another Some slip and fall into the freezing river below
but Robbie saves easily a half dozen

Ray nearby is clutching Rachel fighting to keep space around
her so she isnt crushed by the crowd He watches Robbie
impressed

ON THE EMBANKMENT 83
the Tripod that appeared from the forest remains at its edge and
for a split-second it seams the boat may escape it simply by
virtue of being on the water But then -

ON THE FERRY BOAT a4

-- the boat now fifty yards out into the river lurches from a
sudden shift in the water beneath then

Ray turns and looks over the side The river is churning
somethings coming up from the river bottom and as he looks --

- THE HEAD OF A TRIPOD BREAKS THE RIVER SURFACE

Everyone on board SCREAMS and the ferry boat tilts sharply to the
side unbalanced by the sudden depression in the water

The Tripod rises higher and higher

The deck of tho ferry is at a thirty degree angle now cars begin
to slide tumbling toward the railing

Ray grabs hold of Robbie whos still working to help people on
board the boat

ROBBIE
HEY

84

But Ray doesn’t have time to discuss it cars are SLAMMING into
the railing all around them now he hurls Robbie over the side of
tha boat away from the falling cars then grabs hold of Rachel
and jumps overboard himself

Just in tima too because just the boat lurches again and half a
dosen cars SMASH through the railing whore they were standing

840-94 OMITTED B4A-94

95B

UNDERWATER 95

Ray Rachel and Robbie are underwater just starting to swim for
the top All around them cars PLUNGE into the river landing
like depth charges and sinking immediately their terrified
OCCUPANTS pounding on the windows and trying like hell to open
the doors

Ray and the kids kick for the surface --

IN THE RIVER 9SA
-- and find themselves just a few foot away from the churning
propellers of the sinking ferry boat which is slowly rolling
over onto its top its lights flickering as it hits the water

As the ferry boat twists in the water they kick like hell to gat
away from the spinning blades

The boat itself which is now half sunk and well on its way to

going completely underwater is churning the river like crazy
its lights still burning in the murky dopths Theyre buffeted
beyond their control sucked --

UNDERWATER 95B
Boneath the surface Ray Robbie and Rachol tumble close to tha
massive propellers The blades narrowly miss them they kick for
the top --

Ext IN THE RIVER NIGHT 96
-- and again their three heads break the surface

Ray GASPS treading water hard The othor two are stunned but
alive spitting river water

They turn and look back The Tripod thats risen up from the
middle of the river calls out -- “ULLA”

A moment later there‘’s another mechanical sound seemingly coming
in response and fWO MORE TRIPODS stride out of the forest
headed for the river
6A

OW TOP OF THE SINKING BOAT 6A

a MAN teeters for balance one of the last left behind Suddenly
black snakelike tentacles wrap around his mid-section He looks
down in horror --

-- and is swept up into the air Following him we look up and
see that the tentacles hava come from underneath the Tripod
thats standing in the river

fhe Man is swapt aloft and around behind the Triped which is
where we lose sight of him Were unsure where hes going or what
it wants with hin

IN THE RIVER 963

the current is strong it grabs hold of Ray and the kids and
sweeps them away from the sinking ferry boat out into the middle
of the river Thay GASP and struggle in the current

Ray lcoks back over his shoulder at the ruins of the dock
where the lead Tripod now unfurls its heat-ray and trains it on
the sinking ferry boat and the hundreds of innocent people
swarming on and around it

The Tripod points the disk at the deck and there is a flash a
silent brightness like summer lightning Waves like rippling
hest distort the air between the Triped and the deck then --

RAY
GO UNDER

-- the three of them gulp air and kick down under the surface
UNDERWATER 97
wa see the explosion of flame that means the ferry boat has been
incinerated Its muffled under here and seen through the prism
of dark river water but still horrifying

ABOVE THE SURFACE 98

they bob up again boyond the ferry boat now pulled hard by the
rivers current more than halfway across

The Tripods mova forward into the river their swarms of
tentacles pluck SCREAMING PASSENGERS right off the dack of the
burning sinking boat Where they go after theyre swept up into
the air we still cant see

Ray and the kids continue to be swept downstream just away from
the chaos which is good because --

98

-- the Tripods fire again The heat-rays sweep in unison across
fhe center of tho river directly into the swarm of SCREAMING
nnocents

A gigantic cloud of steam rises up from the touch of the hest-ray
on the river Stranga objects start leaping out of the water and
into the air flopping all around Ray and the kids Theyre
fish

And if we wonder why theyre leaping we quickly put it together
as the river around Ray and the kids ROILS seven to eight foot
waves wash toward them and a huge cloud of steam washes over
them obscuring all their vision

ROBBIE
THE WATER

RACHEL
ITS BURHING ME

RAY

SWIM FOR SHORE)

And they do Ray grabbing Rachol and digging at the water with
everything hes got

Behind them the vast cloud of steam still blocks much of the
destruction behind but they can hear SCREANS hear the HISSING
and BOILING of the water and see the FLASHES of the heat-ray as
its applied again and again

Theyre near the shore now but a huge bubbling wave of water is
washing straight towards them The shores just twenty feet
away then ten but the boiling wave is just behind tham too the
water rises up --

- they hurl themselves onto the rivor bank --

EXT PAR RIVERBARK NIGHT 99

-- and the tide of boiling water erupts in front of them just
inches from their safe perch

They lie there for a moment scalded catching their breath But
with the SOUNDS of the destruction in the river --

RAY
Keep moving

-- he drags the kids to thelr feet and they bagin to climb the far
bank towards higher ground

ExT ON THE HILLSIDE NIGHT 100

Ray drags the kids upward upward two hundred yards to the
brink of the embankment on the far side of the river from the
dock

Pinally they collapse to the ground and look down at the
wholesale slaughter they so narrowly escaped

Its a view of staggering destruction and the first wide shot of
the mayhem that weve seen so far

Through clouds of steam and billowing smoke we seo it all -- the
flaming dock (the boat has sunk by now) the drowning victims
and the hideous Tripods wading methodically through the river
directing the heat-ray at any survivors as they make their way
upstrean

Raising his gaze Ray looks up to the highlands where TEN
THOUSAND REFUGEES are still flooding down the main road that
leads to the ferry dock funneled directly into the massacre by
half a dozen Tripods that stalk behind tham spreading
destruction

On the horizon beyond fires dot the landscape as far as Ray can
see and to the north an even worse omen --

-- the sky is alive with yet another lightning storm which will
birth more of these murdering machines Its the rout of
civilisation tho massacre of mankind

Ray pulls his two children close their burned soaking bodies
huddled next to his quivering with fear but still alive

CUT TO

101-104 OMITTED 101-104

ExT ANOTHER ROAD NIGHT 105
Ray Rachel and Robbie trudge along another road still no
people in sight Theyre tired been walking all night Far up
ahead they can see a remote old Victorian house near a hilltop
SHRIEK

The three of them nearly leap out of their shoes at a DEAPEZNING
SOUND Instinctively Ray and Rachel duck just as --

-- FOUR FIGHTER JETS SCREAM OVERHEAD

105 105

Por the record theyre Al0 Thunderbolt Warthogs and wa‘ve never
seen fighters this low to the ground they can’t be more than a
hundred feet up

They sweap over the ground bank up slightly at the hilltop and
swoop over the rise disappearing down low on the other side

Brilliant flashes of light follow moments later lighting up the
gathering night and hollow BOOHS come a few seconds later

Robbie who has stayed on his feet lets out a WAR WHOOP and takes
off running in the direction the fighters went

RAY
Robbie

He takes off after him dragging Rachol by the hand

And theyre not alone -- a group of SIX OR SEVEN COLLEGZ-AGE KIDS
emerge from the tree line to the east following the path the
jets took waving their arms in the air

Ray notices them lcoks around more ag he runs toward the
hilltop A PAHILY OF FOUR now emerges from the back of a van that
was nose-down in the ditch on the side of the road it had looked
empty ond abandoned but was really a hiding place

And theres more -- from the old Victorian house on the eastern
horizon a BURLY MAN of about fifty comes cautiously outside
elutching a rifle head darting from side to sida

Tho countryside which seemed so abandoned a few minutes ago is
suddenly alive with survivors coming out of hiding

Ahead Robbie races toward the hilltop a couple hundred yards
ahead rimmed by tall grass Ray keeps moving after him one
hand holding onto Rschels arm firmly

RAY (contd)
8top where you are Stay together

RACHEL
Dont make ma go closer Dont make me
leok I dont want to look

RAY
STAY TOGETHER

Abead Robbie ducks suddenly as a brilliant flash lights up the
entire area like broad daylight A split-second later a bone
rattling EXPLOSION follows 105

Its hard to describe just how loud the explosion is but its
result is powerful Ray and Rachel fall to their knees hands
clamped over their ears

Rachel SHOUTS somathing at Ray but he can‘t hear her over the
still-echoing blast He SHOUTS something back same story

He grabs hold of her again and pulls her up the hill shes
SHOUTING her objections but Robbie’s still moving ahead of them
crawling toward the top of the hill

RAY (contd)
Im gonna get Robbie and be right back
Stay here STAY RIGHT HERE

Rachel nods frantically and digs herself into the hillaide hands
plastered over her ears eyes screwed shut

ExT HILLTOP RIGHT 106

Ray crawls toward the top of the rise as fast as he can closing
in on Robbie who is headed for a GROUP OF SOLDIERS who are
crouched at the rim of the hill staring down into the valley
below The noise up here is deafening two of the Soldiers are
watching the battle below through binoculars two more SHOUT into
radios but we cant hear 4 word theyre saying

Its a command post up on the ridge the Soldiers are using laser
targeting (for the fighter jets) and reconnaissance gear

The battle itself is obscured by the tall waving grass a thick
gray smoke that billows in over everything and blinding flashes
that accompany the constant explosions coming from below

Ray reaches the still-moving Robbie and hurls himself at hin
tackling him ten feet short of the top of the hill He crashes to
the ground on top of him as the four fighter jets that flew
overhead oarlier circle back for a strafing run coming in low

As tho fighting rages betwoen the Army and the invaders another
battle rages between Ray and Robbie as Ray SHOUTS in Robbies
ear pleading with him not to go over the hill Robbie twists and
thrashes in response trying to escape his father

We cant hear anything they say ag MORTARS are exploding
theres dense GUNFIRE SHOUTING and SCREAMING from the battle
raging over the hilltop (For suggested Ray speech see APPENDIX
D)

The ontire hilltop goes white again all the air in the valley
seems to suck inward in one concussive second and then it’s
exploded in another deafening KA-BOOM

e6
106

TWO PLATOONS of Marinos pour over the ridge around them down to
join the battle on the ground several CIVILIAN ONLOOKERS race
forward too over the hillside but any available Soldiers try to
deter them to guide the civilians out of harm‘a way and to
safety

Robbie rolls over and twists his foot free but Ray lunges and
gets his arms wrapped around his sons midsection The kid is
fighting him trying like hell to wrench free

As they struggle Ray cranes his head to gat a look down tho hili
back the way ho came to make sure Rachel is still there

Shas fifty feet below them hands clamped over her cars
SCREAMING terrified and there are TWO SWARMS OF SOLDIERS now
pounding their way up the hill boots SLAMMING into the ground
all around her

A WELL-MEANING FAMILY has o hold of her theyre pulling on her
but shes rosisting Bodies cross in front of him he loses
sight of her

FURTHER DOW THE HILL 107

the Family which must think Rachel is abandoned is trying like
hell to get her to come with then

RACHEL
BBS COMING BACK FOR MZ HES COMING
BACK FOR ME
OW THE HILLTOP 108

Ray sees whats happening he SHOUTS for her

RAY
RACHEL RACHEL

ROBBIE
LET GO OF ME

He swings a leg around and KICKS at his father trying to get

Below Ray gets another glimpse of Rachol shoes calling out for
bin but she doosnt know where he is and the Well-Heaning Pamily
has a hold of hor and theyre dragging her off in tho opposite
direction

Ray looks back to Robbie whos now wriggling out of his grasp
hes passing right through Rays arms Ray looks back down at
Rachel SCREAMING for him as shes swept away now passing
completely out of his line of sight

108

Robbie‘s passing through his grasp now just his feet are within
reach and Rays got a hold of them but knows what he has to do

He lets go

Ray and Robbie take off in opposite directions Robbie throwing
one last look back over his shoulder at his father as he dashes
ever the hillside the other way headed down into the valley to
join the attacking soldiers

Ray races toward Rachel fighting against the tide of Onlcokers
and Soldiers headed toward the hilltop

FURTHER DOWN THE HILL 109
Ray plows through a break in the people and he sees Rachel being
dragged away by the Well-Meaning Family Rays on her a second
later scooping her up into his arus

RACHEL
DADDY)

WELL-MEANING FATHER
I‘m sorry we thought-

Rays got no time for niceties ha ignores the family and whirls
looks back up at the hilltop

RAY
ROBBIE

Night abruptly FLASHES into day again and wo know what this
means theres another one of those BLASTS coming Ray and
Rachel both instinctively clap their hands over their ears and
here it comes again --

-- KA-BOOM

Ray and Rachel pull their palms away from their ears their hands
slick with thoir own blood this time

Ray SCREAMS for Robbie a few times more open-mouthed desperate
but we cant hear it

Then suddenly the ROARING battle sounds fade and thores only
a strange silence coming from the valley

Ray puts Rachel down takes her by the hand again and they look
at each other excited Is it possible

But just as hope rises --

- BURNING MAN races back over the hill and crashes into hin
ae
109 109

Ray tacklos the Burning Man and rolls him on the ground gets the
flames out He looks back up toward the hilltop --

-- as HALF A DOSEN BURNING ONLOOKERS pour back over the hilitop

Ray moves as fast and as hard as he can knocking them to the
ground rolling them in the dirt Now sound comes back and with
vengeance HORRIBLE SCREAMS explosions of flame

Ray looks up toward the top of the hill

RAY (contd)
ROBBIE ROBBIE

Now military vehicles come pouring over the hilltop headed back
this way fast and then soldiers on foot running for their
lives in a massive chaotic retroat

And then in pursuit -- THE TOPS OF THREE TRIPODS appear over the
crest of the hill

Ray and Rachel freeze in momentary panic just as the POUR
FIGHTER JETS reappear SCREAMING over the horizon to save the
day

Ray and Rachel duck down hands over their heads and through the
blowing weeds Ray sees four small projectiles HISS from beneath
the planes’ wings

The missiles head straight for the Tripods but when theyre a
good fifty yards away the missiles explode harmlessly in nid-
air as if detonated by an invisible protective shield around
the invading machines

Ray and Rachel fleeing fall into an observation point next to
TWO PORWARD AIR CONTROLLERS who are frantically trying to
redirect aircraft A THIRD SOLDIER an officer leaps into the
pit running back from the other side of the hill burned and
streaked with dirt and blood Ha grabs hold of the other
Soldiers tries to drag tham out of the pit

SOLDIER 3
Fall back Move the hell back Fall
back five hundred meters on my ten
oclock

SOLDIER 1
Sir weve dumped HE and sabot on these
things what have we got left Tows7
Should we try tha tows 109

SOLDIER 3
Doesnt matter what you fire you cant
get through nothing punches through

SOLDIER 2
What is it some kind of shield

SOLDIER 3
(neds)
Wa cant penetrate it everything
dotonates before it even gats closel

Rays heard enough He grabs hold of Rachel and thoy crawl out of
the pit and run in the opposite direction down the hill

They near the bottom of the hill still nowhera to go but
forward shead away but that won‘t do they wont survive and
just before panic hits --

VOICE OVER HERE OVER HERE

-- he hears a VOICE and whirls The Burly Man the one they sav
coming out of the old Victorian house with a rifle before is
fifty yards to the left gesturing wildly to them

Ray and Rachel change course and head toward him running as fast
as their legs will carry then

fhe Burly Man turns and takes off waving them to follow and
they do toward the house just beyond a stand of trees

110-115 OMITTED 110-115

Exr OLD HOUSE NIGHT 116

fhe ROAR of the battle is still deafening as Ray and Rachel tear
across the front lawn of the old house following the Burly Man
He doesnt go in the front door but instead to the side of the

house where he throws open a storm cellar door

mnt OLD HOUSE - CELLAR BIGHT 117

Ray and Rachel stumble down the half flight of stairs and fall
into the cellar GASPING for air

The Burly Man drops his gun and goes to work on the storm cellar
doors SLAMMING them shut and sliding a number of heavy bars and
lecks into place to seal then

He hurries down the stairs out of breath himself and squats in
front of them The place is lit by a single hurricane lamp on top
of a red cooler

117

BURLY MAN
You all right

Rachel nods unabie to speak Ray doesnt answer Tho Burly Man
puts an arm on his shoulder

BURLY MAH (cont’d)
What about you

Ray just looks at him unable to speak his eyas big and empty
cur TO
mt OLD HOUSE - CELLAR SIGHT 118

Later that night maybe the middle of the night The cellar is
lit only by the tiny flame enduring in the hurricane lamp

On one side there’s a small cot and Rachel is lying on it under
a couple blankets Rays crouching beside it stroking her hair
gently WHISPERING to her Her eyes are heavy they want to be
closed but she’s trying like hell to keep them open ‘Theyre in
the middle of a conversation

RACHEL
What do you mean He got a ride From
who

RAY

Shhh close your eyes

RACHEL
With the army man

RAY
Hes has gonna meet us honey In
Boston At Moms Close your ayes Let

She forces her eyes open again WHISPERS to him

RACHEL
Where do you think Mom is right this
minute

RAY
Waiting for us I think she and Tim are
in Boston at Grandmas house and
theyra all waiting for us

RACHEL
Are you sure

118

RAY
I think they cant sleep because
they‘re so worried about us so theyre
sitting in the kitchen and theyre
drinking that awful tea Grandma makes
and theyre counting every minute until
they see us again

He reaches down to give her hand a squeeze notices shes
clutching somathing there Its a yellow third-place ribbon the
one she tried to gat him to notice earlier Shed stuffed it in
her pocket

Ray opens her fingers pulls the ribbon out

RAY (contd)
This yours Did you win this

RAY

RACHEL
(yawning)
Walk trot and canter They call it

RAY
Woll Im very impressed Im Im
proud of you

Rachel smiles starts to reply --

RACHEL
Sing me Lullaby and Goodnight

RAY
I dont know that one

RACHEL
Sing me Hushabye Mountain

RAY
I don’t know that one either

She turns her head away disappointed Ray thinks for a moment
then starts to sing softly huskily Its Little Deuce Coupe”
the Beach Boys song

118 118

After a few lines Rachel is asleep Ray furrows his brow
slightly that was odd how quickly she fell asleep but he puts
one hand on her stomach -- shes still breathing

He pulls the blanket up around her chin and crosses the basement
Tho Burly Man is sitting on a small folding camp chair next to tha
cooler the rifle over his knees He gestures to another chair
which he has unfolded for Ray

Ray sits heavily close to collapse and drops his head in his
bands The Burly Man reaches out and nudges him with the back of
one hand and Ray looks up -- hes offaring a glass half-filled
with a clear liquid

BURLY MAN
Peach schnapps Disgusting I know
Pound a whole case of this shit

RAY
Thank you

Ray takes a sip Tho Burly Man nods knocks his back He
breathes heavily labored most of the time maybe hes asthmatic

BURLY MAN
I’m sorry about your son

Ray nods They drink in silence for a moment Then

RAY
Did you lose anyone

BURLY MAH
All of ‘em

He looks away That seems to be all hes going to say about that
Ray respects it The Burly Man holds out a hand

BURLY MAN (contd)
Harlan Ogilvy

RAY
Ray Perrier

They shake Ogilvy offers a matal plate with some sliced ham and
bread op it Ray takes some and eats

RAY (contd)
This your house

OGILVY
Pound it empty

118 2118

He looks at Ray but when Ray meets his eye he fidgets Maybe he
didn‘t find it empty

OGILVY (contd)
What

RAY
Didnt say a word

Rays eyas drop down and for the first time he notices the large
hunting knife Ogilvy wears strapped to his ankle

OGILVY
Got water food enough for weeks
Youre welcome to stay Both of you

RAY
Thank you I gotta sleep

He stands up

OGILVY
Those machines those Tripods they
got

Ray turns back Ogilvy shakes his head in dire admiration

OGILVY (contd)
Buried ‘em right under our feet Since
before the first people were here
Theyve been planning this for a million
years Were beat to shit

RAY
Please keap your voice down

OGILVY
Think about it they defeated the
greatest power in the world in a couple
days Walked right over us And thase
are only the first theyll keep coming
This isnt a war any more than theres
a war between men and maggots

RAY
Then what is it

OGILVY
Its an extermination

He pours himself some more schnapps Ray nods Again he tries
to walk away Again Ogilvy wont let hin

118 118

OGILVY (cont ‘d)
You afraid

RAY
Of course Im afraid

OGILVY
I‘va bean around death plenty Drive an
embulance in the city Drove an
ambulance Thats all over now

RAY
Hew York

OGILVY

You know the people that make it The
ones that dont flatline before tha
hospital It‘s the ones that keep their
eyes open that keap leoking at you
keep thinking theyre the ones who
survive We cant lose our heads Ray
Running thats whatll kill you And
Im dead set on living

(laughs bitterly)
“Dead set on living”

We finishes his schnapps again and pours himsalf some more Ray
watches him This is starting to be a concern

Somewhere far off in the distance there is a hollow BOOH

RAY
Thank you for taking us in

Ray goes to the other side of the basement where Rachel is
asleep He lies down on the floor next to her cot makes a pillow
of his jacket

More hollow BOOMS except theyre slightly closer

Ogilvy still sitting with his back to him and faintly
gilhouetted by the hurricane lamp calls out in a normal too-
loud voice

OGILVY
Not gonna be exterminated

Ray closes his eyes but a few chunks of earth and plaster fall
from the ceiling and land on the floor around hin

He opens his eyes More debris wafts down onto his face Ray
sits up and looks over at Ogilvy who turns around to face him a
mad grin on his face 118

OGILVY (cont ‘’d)
Were gonna fight ‘em Ray They gotta
have a weakness Somehow they killed a
few of those things in Osaka thats
what I heard You telling me the Japs
ean figure it out but wea cant

He comes over and elbows Ray in the ribs a hard macho gesture
Ray GROANS in pain his ribs are probably fractured

Prom just outside a loud rhythmic POUNDING begins like the
sound of a factory coming back to life after lunch hour The
house above them SHUDDERS Ray gets to his feet a horrible
thought growing in his mind

OGILVY (contd)
Its okay

He leans forward opens the door on the hurricane lamp and PUFFS
out the flame plunging the basement into near-darkness

OGILVY (contd)
Have a look

He stands still clutching the rifle and scurries across the
room gesturing to Ray to follow Ha climbs up on an overturned
erate onto a small ledge built into the wall

When he climbs on it his face is right at window level A board
has been cut to fit the window space and slid into place now
Ogilvy slides it back slightly so he can see outside

Putting a finger to his lips a signal to Ray to keep quiet he
hops off the wall and gestures to Ray to climb up

Ray does with dread Ogilvy gestures -- look through the slit
THROUGH THE SLIT 119

Ray can sea the open area to the side of the house But it iant
opon field any more

TWO TRIPODS have made their encampment in the field and as Ray
watches a THIRD TRIPOD strides out from the trees calling to the
others in its familiar mechanical tone

“OLLA™

IN THE CELLAR 120

Rays face snaps away from the window in horror Ogilvy who
seemed to know about this seems unconcerned

CONTIRUED 120

OGILVY
Dont worry they cant hear us when
‘those things are on

He scurries across the basement climbs a ladder on the other
side and pushes aside another piece of plywood that hes used to
obscure the window over there

Again he gestures to Ray who reces silently across the room and
up the ladder

THROUGH THE SECOND SLIT 122

Ray sees ANOTHER TRIPOD on this side of the house and as he
watches its GIANT MECHANICAL LEGS stride right past the vindow
and stop

With an otherworldly GROAN the legs contract into themselves
lowaring the head of the Tripod down to ground level

fheres a PLASH of brilliant light from within the head of tha
tripod that momentarily illuminates the fields around the house
and in that flash we see equipment dug-out pits a bivouac -
clear evidence that this is and has been an alien encampment

In their hurry to get inside Ray and Rachel didn’t notice it all
before but they are now living in a house taken over

BACK IH THE BASEMENT 122

Ray leaps off the ladder and Jands in front of Ogilvy whos
pleased at showing off the true nature of their location Ray
grabs him by the shirt drags his face right up to his

RAY
You knew Are you insane How could
you bring us here

OGILVY
80 we could fight ‘em together Ray
Now were the ones coming up from
underground And when the timas right
well take them by surprise the way
they took us

Ray looks at him realizing too late this guys lost it
OGILVY (contd)

Right under their feet Ray Right here
under their feet

124A

122

RAY
You killed us You just killed us

BX OLD ROUSE DAY 123
The next morning

SFFFT A piece of plywocd slides away and an eyeball appears
right in front of us Were outside the old house down at ground
level

Theres something strange about the landscape out here
eaverywhera there is dirt or grass or moisture there is a
creeping red fuss a red weed Weve sean these clawing tendrils
before on the surface of the barren planet in the opening

The red weed seethes swarming over a dripping outdoor faucet at
the base of the house

Rays eye is peering out through the basement slit looking
furtively from side to side The sounds of HEAVY MACHINERY can
be heard behind us the rhythmic pounding drone of a factory
The shadows of tall moving shapes play across the house

INT OLD HOUSE - CELLAR DAY 124
Ray slides the piece of wood back into place and hops off the
narrow ledge Hes upset didnt like what he saw clearly
theyre still hemmed in by the Tripods Tha POUNDING MACHINERY
is deep and penetrating here in the basement and it will hammer
avay constantly the entire time theyre here

Up near the window he sees the tendrils of a batch of red weed
growing around the edge of the window making their way into the
basement

He reaches up and RIPS them off ‘Theyre tough sinewy it takes
a few pulls

He lcoks across tha room sees Rachel stiil asleep on the cot

Ogilvy is back on the camp chair his rifle across his legs
rocking back and forth slightly watching Rays every move

cur TO
Int CELLAR - A SHORT TIME LATER DAY 124a

Later Ray is beside Rachels cot Shes awake now and looking
up at him apprehensively

124A 124A

With a dull SCRAPE he strikes a match from a book of matches Ho
holds a straight pin in the other hand and passes it back and
forth through the flamo sterilizing it Rachel stares at him
with wide teary eyes fixed on the pin shes got her left hand
balled up in a fist and is clutching it to herself

RAY
(whispering)
Its infected Its got to come out or
itll just get worse

Reluctantly Rachel opens her hand and wa get a look at her palm --
the sliver sho got a few days ago is indeed infected the skin is
puffy red and angry all around it Ray moves the pin closer

RACHEL
Do you have to do that

Ray putea down the pin reaches down carefully and pinches the
end of the protruding splinter

RAY
Wot anymore Look the infection pushed
it out a little

Be pulls it the rest of the way out and Rachel snatches her hand
back happily

RACHEL
Told you It wasnt supposed to be
there 30 my body got rid of it

RAY
Yeoh It did didnt it

RACHEL
(pause then)
How long are we going to stay here

RAY
Not long We need to wait for the right
moment and then were going to leave
and find another place to stay

RACHEL
Are wa still going to Moms

RAY
Of course wa are But in the meantime
just try not to make a sound and Ill
bring you something to eat and drink

124A 124a

Rachel nods fearful Ray nods back good for you and turns to
gat soma feod But Ogilvy is right behind him

OGILVY
Leave Whats the matter with you
were gonna fight I already started a
tunnel you wanna see it

RAY
No I dont want to see your tunnel

He goes across the room to the other slit and slides it open
Nothing encouraging there either More red weed drips down the
wall here Ray rips that off too

OGILVY
What weve got to do is get to the
cities Well have our own tunnels
there ready-made The subways see
what Im saying

RAY
Keep your voice down

OGILVY
We can hide a whole army down there
Wall go underground stage attacks at
night Were the Resistance Ray They
cant occupy this country occupations
always fail history taught us that a
thousand times This is our land we
eat it we breathe it only we can live
on it They cant survive here they
werent built for it they

Ray swerves over in front of him and bends down holding e finger
up in front of Ogilvys face He speaks in a whisper (as he will
the whole time theyre in the cellar)

RAY
Keep Your voice Down

Ogilvy stares right back at him with meaning Ray looks down
Whe barrel of Ogilvys gun is pointed at him He pushes it away
with one finger and leans in to Ogilvys ear

RAY (contd)
You know the first time you fire that
were all dead

OGILVY
You dont know how well I shoot

124A 124A
RAY
I dont care how well you shoot theyll
hear it
OGILVY

I told you they cant hear us when
those things ara pounding

RAY
Just remember what I said

Ogilvy stares at hin
And takes another swig of schnapps
CUT TO

125-125B OMITTED 125-1255

Int CELLAR NIGHT 126

Bighttime Still in the cellar The red waed Ray tore down has
grown back in from around the corners of the windows Tho
rhythmic POUNDING goes on

Water has pooled in the basement from a dripping spigot on the
far side Rachel is huddled in a dry corner her hands clamped
over her ears going quietly insane from the constant noise

Ogilvy comos over to har slides down onto the floor next to her
es half drunk

OGILVY
You miss your mommy

Rachol just leoks back at him scared doesnt answer Ray who
is across the cellar getting some food onto a plate for Rechel
notices Ogilvy talking to her

OGILVY (cont‘d)
I had a girl nearly your age If
enything happens to your daddy I12
take care of you

Ray grabs Ogilvy by the collar and turns him away from Rachel
but does so subtly so his daughter deesnt notice the forca
behind tha gesture

RAY
(low voice)
Youve got nothing to say to her
Understand
(MORE)

126 126

RAY (contd)
You want to talk to somebody you got a
question you ask me

Ogilvy leoks at him measures whether a fight with Ray is a good
or bad thing

OGILVY
Yeah I got a question What exactly is
your plan Ray I mean I know what Im
gonna do what about you You gonna
just sit here wait for them to come get
you Is that it Is that what youve
got up your sleeva

He gets up and grabs his whealbarrow goes noisily across the
basement to go back to work

RAY
Keep the noise down”

OGILVY
(almost shouting)
Maybe you want to be caught couple
days hiding in a basement too much for
you I bet

RAY
Shut up

Suddenly the pounding stops Its quiet out there now VERY
quiet As if they heard something

RAY (cont‘d)
Listen It stopped

But Ogilvy pays it no mind he keeps talking in a normal voice

OGILVY
Probably turn yourself right in thats
what youll do Wonder what you ever

As soon as its out of sight Ogilvy straightens up to grab the
axe off the wall Ray stands and grabs hoid of his arm to stop
him but Ogilvy swings an elbow into Rays broken ribs hard

Ray crumples to the flcor in pain is dying to scream but
manages to stifle it

Ogiivy snatches the axe and crouches down again raising it
waiting for the probe to come back into the room

Prom the floor Ray looks around frantically and spots a large
old mirror leaning up against the wall nearby In great pain he
raises himself up on one elbow and crawls forward to it

He grabs hold of the mirrors gilt edges and drags it slowly
silently over in front of himself and Rachel Ogilvy nearby
still has the axe raised in readiness

Ray HISSES for his attention imploring the man to come behind
the mirror Ogilvy shakes his head no but Ray mouths silently

RAY (CONTD)
(ROT NOW LATER PLEASE WOT NOW)

Ogilvy debates still leaving himself out in the open

RAY (contd)
WE WILL GET THEM LATER I PROMISE)

The probe perhaps hearing them pulls out of the root cellar and
back into the main room just as Ogilvy reluctantly decides to
scampor behind the mirror

The probe senses the movement and darts quickly across the roca
bumping gently into the surface of the mirror

Behind the mirror Ray Rachel and Ogilvy all remain frozen

The probes head recoils from the mirror seems to tilt its head
din curiosity The mirror fogs right in front of it maybe the
probe expels C02 like a breathing organian

It studies the mirror for one more moment then with a piercing
H168 it‘a recalled slithering back across the cellar at top
speed and whipping up and out through the now-broken window

After ao moment the RHYTHMIC POUNDING of the machinery resumes
Ray drags himself up into a sitting position leaning against the

wall aursing his ribs Rachel at his side Ogilvy sits cross-
legged staring at him still holding the axe

126 126

OGILVY
I got my doubts about you Mister

Ray stares him dom Hes about to get up and take Rachel back to
the other side of the basement but he freezes staring down at
the wator that’s pooled on the basement floor There are ripples
in it little wavelets flowing toward hin

Reflexively he hunches hunch down in the hiding place again
listening The ripples get bigger something is moving on the
far side of the basement Rachel looks up at Ray her eyes
pleading -- “what is it” Ray shakes his head “don’t move“

They listen Across the room they can hear a LABORED BREATHING
thick short wat breaths Hon-human breaths

Ray moves slowly raising his head to pear between some laundry
that hangs from a clothesline overhead

THROUGH THE LAUNDRY

he gots his firat (and only) good look at the rounded bulk of one
of the CREATURES

Its about five fest long dense sluglike in appearance It has
three stubby limbs all underneath it and a long set of tendrils
around its “mouth” similar to the ones that dangle beneath the
belly of the Tripod its operating Its skin is somewhat
translucent its internal organs visible through it

Its “mouth” is shoved over the dripping water spigot on the far
wall SLURPING at the precious liquid Its breathing is very
heavy and slow it seems ill or incapacitated in seme way As Ray
watches TWO MORE of the things slither through the window
opening their body mass streamlining to get through tho narrow
space then re-expanding as they land on the basement floor

As the first creature sucks at the water pipe the second goes to
it perhaps to check on it The third creature rummages through
the stuff on the basement floor using its tendrils to dip into a
cardboard box filled with photographs

It scatters most of them across the basemont floor but finds one
that might ba of interast It passes it over to the second
eroature which takes it from it and examines it

BEHIND THE HANGING LAUNDRY

Ray holds his breath Ogilvy who is full of tough talk when not
facad with danger is frozen in abjoct horror Rachol
thankfully has her view obscured and cant seo whats going on 126

the creatures just start to move across the basement toward the
three humans crouched in the far corner when -- OLLA - a
machanical cry from the Tripod outside sounds The three bulky
creatures move quickly and with sudden power even nimble their
stubby logs propelling them rapidly across the flcor up the
wall and out the window to rejoin their ship

IN BI8 HIDING PLACE

Ray exhales deeply and turns around to face Rachel He looks
down at his hands which have been balled up into fists He
forces himself to unclench There are four red gashes in each
palm where his nails dug into his skin in fear

CUT TO
Int OLD HOUSE - CELLAR DAY 127

The next day Or maybe the one after that Theyre blending
together now One thing wa know for sure -- theres a hell of a
lot more red weed in here than their used to be It fringes the
windows of course but its dripping down the walls too

Ray whos staring up at one of the windows does a double take
Through a gap in the frame theres a thin red mist coming into
the basement like gas seeping through the cracks

Qgilvys across the room staring out one of the slits

Ray stands and goes to window where the red mist is filtering in
He holds out a hand The red mist covers his hand and he pulls it
back looks at it Rubs his fingers together

The red substance smears and it looks and feels unpleasantly
familiar Deep down Ray probably knows what it is but doesn’t
want to admit it

He looks up at the wall where the red mist has settled over a
patch of red weed which is twitching and growing excitedly
underneath it

Suddenly from the other side of tho room Ogilvy emits a stunned
CRY (which he fails to mute) and falls backwards

Ray leaps forward and catches him before he tumbles off the
narrow ledge preventing the racket that would have coms from him
hitting the floor

RAY
What is it What

OGILVY
The that thing It it

127

Ray sorambles up to the ledge and peers out through the slit
THROUGH THE SLIT 128

he sees the legs of one of the Tripods as it returns This Tripod
has a different feature than weve seen before a device that
extends from its shell a large metallic basket of soma sort
affixed to its back

Ray squints trying to figure out this new development but
Ogilvys hands are on him pulling at him to get at the slit

OGILVY
Lat me seal

Ray swatsa him away like a fly looks back through the slit

Suddenly from the underbelly of the Tripeds “head” half a
dozen whiplike tendrils shoot out and extend to about a hundred
feet in length each

They snake around up to the basket on the back of the machine
and slither inside it HUMAN SCREAMS come from inside

RAY
Oh God

The tendrils emerge from the basket wrapped around the bedy of a
MAR IN BIS FORTIES The Man is injured but still conscious
SHRIEKING

The tendrils snap hurling the Man to the ground just behind a
large pile of dirt then they stiffen pinning him there just
out of our sight

The Tripod shifts so that its standing directly over him then a
thin pipette emerges from its base and shoots straight down into
the earth where the man was screaming

And he stops screaming

The translucent pipette turns red as blood flows up through it
Ray GASPS staring in horror suddenly from the back of the
Tripod a thick red mist sprays out covering the field of red
wood balow

BACK It THE CELLAR 129
Ray whips away from the slit horrified and looks again at the

red mist coming through the window on the far side and at the red
smear on his hand

129

Its blood human blood and theyre using it to fertilize the
red weed

Hands shaking Ray finds the piece of plywood and slides it back
into places obscuring the window

Ha looks across the room and sees Rachel whos staring at hin
desperate for information (right like he‘s gonna tell her this)
Ogilvy is nowhere to be found

But suddenly theres a sharp SCRAPING sound from across the
basement Loud way too loud

Ray leaps off the ledge and hurries across the basement to the
small root cellar thats off to one side He opens the door

Int ROOT CELLAR DAY 130
Ogilvy is inside standing waist doop in a hole shovel in hand
his asthmatic breathing louder than ever Hes digging like a
crazy man This must be the “tunnel” he was so proud of

RAY
Stop itl

OGILVY
(WAY too loud)
Christ did you see it drinking
Ray grabs him by the arm roughly

RAY
Be quiet

OGILVY
They drink us

He jams the shovel into the ground it CLAHGS off a rock

RAY
Theyll hear you

He reaches out to grab hold of the shovel to pull it away fron
Ogilvy but the man swings it instead catching Ray hard in the
side of the neck

Ray GROANS and falls back He rolls over WHISPERING
desperately

RAY cont’d)
Please youve got to be quiet

130 130
OGILVY
(loud)
Get to the city Tunnel into the
subway
RAY

I wont let my daughter die because of
youl Do you hear what Im saying Do
you understand

Ray gets up to go to him again but Ogilvy whirls brandishing
the shovel

OGILVY
Not MY blood)

Ray looks at him Ogilvy has gone completely unhinged
131 INT OLD HOUSE - CELLAR DAY 131

Ray comes out of the rcot cellar and into the basement looking
around for something searching searching

Rachel watches him puzzled

Outside the SCREAMS and the CLANKING of machinery are louder
now its possible they havent heard the sound of the digging in
the root cellar

From the other room Ogilvy can be heard ranting LOUD
RACHEL
(a whisper)
Dad

Ray finds what he was looking for or something close enough
anyway Its an old tee shirt

He goes to Rachel and drops to his knees in front of her

RACHEL (contd)
What ara you doing

RAY
So matter what you hear do not take
this off Okay

Rachel of course has no clue what he’s talking about but she
neds anyway

Ray reaches out and wraps the tea shirt around her head tying it
firmly in the back

131

Its a blindfold

Ray checks to make sure it‘s tight then turns and hurries out of
frama

We stay on Rachels face half-covered by the dirty tee shirt
and see none of what follows we only hear the sounds and see the
reactions on Rachels obscured face

First we hear the digging louder than ever and Ogilvys
RANTING coming from the other room and his RASPY BREATHING
louder than aver Then footsteps silent swift ones as they
head tovard hin

A door closes Haybe the door to the root cellar The digging
stops Thero are urgent muffled sounds More SHOUTING Ogilvy
again such too loud

Then a silence a long one punctuated cccasionally by slight
sounds of thrashing and that breathing still that RASPY
BREATHING but its all off screen and through a closed door and
its hard to tell

A long moment goes by Only silence

And the BREATHING Raspy labored breathing But only one
person now

A door CREAKS open Then closes very softly
Pootsteps again Heavy BREATHING Someone sliding to the floor

Slowly Rachel roaches up and pulls the blindfold from her eyes
terrified at what shell see

She blinks at the light On the far side of the basement she
sees her father slumped against the wall a vacant expression on
his face breathing hard from the struggle It was his breathing
she heard

He wont look at hor

Rachel turns toward the root cellar sees the door hanging open a
few inches And no sounds coming from inside it

She crawls across the floor of the basement silently and curls
up against her father He puts one arm around her and pulls her
tight but can‘t look at her

Softly Rachel starts to speak through tears 131

RACHEL
I want to show you my school I want to
show you where I sit and my homework
and I want you to eat dinner at my house
I want you to pick ma up from riding
practice I want you to meet ny friend
Paige I want I want you

He reaches down very gently and wipes the tears from her
cheeks

RAY
(whispers)
Youve got me

Wo move in on his oyes haunted dark-ciroled move all the way
in until they £111 the frame and then we dissolve to --

DISSOLVE TO
INT OLD HOUSE CELLAR DAY 132

-- the same eyes but now were pulling back and we can tall time
has passed it shows in the gauntness in their faces and tho
beard growth on Rays face He and Rachel are in basically the
same position still slumped against the wall

Rod weed is engulfing the basement double the density it was
before The area around Ray and Rachel looks like theyve hacked
out a space in the jungle

INT OLD HOUSE - CELLAR NIGHT 134

The oame position later still Its nighttime Both of than
are asleep slumped against the wall Close on Rachels ayes aa
they open She blinks Stares Her eyes pop wide but she
doesn’t move doesnt breathe doesnt dare because not twelve
inches away from her face --

-- IS AN ALIEN PROBE

Its the same kind that slithered into tho basement earlier the
one they eluded but this one seems to have come in while they
were sleeping and theres no avoiding it this time

Rachel lets out a tiny GASP of terror which awakens Ray He
jorks awake and sees the thing too sucks his breath in hard and
that moment of recognition convinces Rachel shes not dreaming

134A

134

She SCREAMS

All the quiet thats been building in the cellar explodes in a
long deafening SHRIZK as Rachel empties her lungs in terror

fhe probe jerks back a foot or se Ray tries to cover Rachels
mouth but this is it shes snapping she can’t take it anymore
Ray lunges for the axe thats nearby and attacks the probe
swinging wildly making some contact

Rachel beyond reason scrambles to her feet and takes off up
the stairs that lead into the house

RAY
Rachel

But she’s already gone out of the basement and Ray is delayed
by his battle with the probe He lands a decisive blow and lops
the head off the thing its remnant withdraws quickly back and
out through the window it came in Ray takes off after Rachel

Int OLD HOUSE - HALLWAY NIGHT 134A

A door SMASHES open from the basement and Ray bursts out into tho
darkened hallway of the old house theyve been hiding under

But shes already gone and the front door is hanging open He
races after her out the front door and into --

everything in sight and extends as far as tho eye can see

Ray SCREAMS but the Tripods already moving away from hin

RAY
RACHEL

le looks around frantically for a weapon anything at all He
sees a Humvee the burned-out military vehicle that rolled past
them earlier

He races to it rips the door open and searches through the
charred interior He finds an automatic pistol and a granade
belt Thosell do

ExT THE MEADOW NIGHT 140

Ray takes off into a vast field of red weed chasing after the
ripod He can see it in the distance moving quickly away from
him covering huge chunks of ground

He SCREAMS at it trying to get its attention Hes just making
sounds boyond words at this point

He FIRES the automatic pistol six seven eight shots in the
distance we can see two or three of them TING off the surfaca of
the Tripod

And it stops
And it turns

Its about three hundred yards away from Ray now and this is it
this is what its all coma down to one human being against one
Tripod and of course he doesnt stand a chance in hell

RAY
Come on come on

The Tripod stands there for a moment evaluating him The black
arm extends from its side the heat-ray disc emerges

RAY (contd)
Im right here
(screaming)
IM NOT GOING ANYWHERE YOU HEAR ME
COME AND GET ME GOD DAMN IT COME AND
GET MEIN

The Tripod seems to think about that for a second And then the
die rotates flattens and the arm retracts into the head of the
Tripod

140 140
It atarts to walk normal speed at first and then fast really
fast right toward him its legs covering the couple hundred
yards in an elegant beautiful blur of motion

Ray takes a breath sucking in as much air os he can get His
whole body trembles he tightens his grip on the belt of hand
grenades and he holds his ground

The Tripod’s close fifty yards or less the black tendrils whip
out from the underbelly of its head they drop down --

-- Ray forces his ayas to stay open the shadow of the Pripod
falls over him the tendrils wrap around him --

-- and hes swept off his feet

141-143 OMITTED 161-143

144 IH MIDAIR 144
suddenly everything is moving When we were in the meadow we had
a wide-open view of events but now wo have almost no view of
whats going on so chaotic is the movement

Ray is caught in the tendrils being lifted up into the air
fast upside-down now while the Tripod turns and takes off across
the field again headed God knows where
Ray is hurled aloft the tendrils release him and he CRASHES
145 Int ON BOARD THE TRIPOD NIGHT 145

-- in the metallic basket on the Tripod’s back A series of
“bars” close ovar the top of the basket trapping him inside
Its noisy up here the WHIRRING of the machinery very loud the
gound of the wind RUSHING past and tho SCREAMS -

-- of the other bumans caught in the basket Ray has landed face
down on the floor of it but when he rolls over he sees there are
FIVE OTHER PEOPLE in the basket with him More on them in a
second

The basket itself which looked matallic when we saw it from down
en the ground is actually more biological in nature when youre
up close or in it Though its surface glints in the sunlight it
seems to seathe to mova as the Pripod moves And the “bars“ are
more like the slick limbs of jungle trees dense as heli3 but not
brittle like metal

148

Tha whole thing is maybe only eight feet square and three feet
high so Ray who has landed face down in it is actually on top
of the other people inside theyre like corpses thrown into a
shallow pit or lobsters in a pen a pile of arms and legs and
writhing torsos

Ray adjusts and finds himself face to face seemingly with all of
them Theres an ARMY PRIVATE a BUSINESSWOMAN TWO TEENAGERS
and an OLDER WOMAN

RAY
Rachel Rachel

Theres much SHOUTING back people are twisting and turning
trying to get off of aach other to little avail as the basket
bounces and shakes and rattles as the Tripod keeps moving

Ray doesnt hear Rachel but through the twisting bunch of
humanity he gets a glimpse of his little girls face trapped
beneath two others

Ray reaches out a hand for her she reaches back through the
mass of people but just when they’ra about to connect --

the basket tilts up at a forty-fiva degree angle suddenly
producing a fresh round of SCREAMING from the trapped humans

Ray is lying with his head on the lower and of the basket now and
through his upside-down viewpoint we see whats happening

A small round opening about eighteen inches across irises open
at what is now the base of the basket Its not a door exactly
its more like a filmy liquid cloud suspended in the air a
water vacuole You can see through it but its definitely dense
and impenetrable when its closed

A set of pincers emerges from inside the Tripods head passing
through the iris

The pincers SNAP hard and grab hold of whatevers closest and in
this case its the ankle of one of the Teenagers a boy about
seventeen

He SCREAMS and the pincers retract The Teenager is pulled hard
sucked into the head of the Tripod hes SCREAMING and hes up to
his knees then his waist then his shoulders and hands are
reaching for him trying to grab hold of him but too late and too
weak

He disappears into the head of the Tripod and the iris SLITHERS
shut again

The basket abruptly levels itself jarring everyone in it

Rays moving now ag the pincers retract the iris opens up into a
sphincter-like opening thats pulling him in Hes up to his
waist half into the opening from which no one has ever returned

MNarshaling ali his strength he SNAPS his arm free and pulls it
tight next to him clutching the grenade belt

RACHEL
(pawing at him)
DADDY

Ray is still moving now hes in up to the middle of his chest
The Army Private and anyone else who is near enough grab hold of
his shoulders or whatever else they can get their hands on
holding onto him with everything theyve got to prevent him from
being sucked all the way inside

One of Rays hands is trapped in the sphincter the one thats
left free is still clutching the grenade belt but Ray is
SCREAMING in pain the sphincter opening must be squeezing hin
like a boa constrictor his whole face is turning red his veins
are bulging hes 4n up to his neck now one arm stretched out
awkwardly (and unnaturally) in front of him

Everybody in the basket is grabbing at him trying like hell to
keop him from going all the way in But the r-Like
device flexes tighter and tighter and all at once with a might
sucking sound --

RACHEL (cont’d)
DADDY WOCOO

-- Ray is sucked all the way inside the head of the beast Rachel
SCREAMS in horror but the Army Private refuses to give up and
before the sphincter completely closes he hurls himself at it
plunging both arms inside it

The sphincter closes on his arms but the Private has hold of
something inside and he twists himself around gats both legs up
against the edge of the thing --

ARMY PRIVATE
PULL MEI

-- and pulls hard with everything he‘s got evaryone else in the
basket pulling on him too

All at once the sphincter CRACKS with a horrible wet CRUNCHING
sound it opens ever so slightly and RAY BURSTS OUT all at
once covered in a thick aqueous goo

Ho lands din the middle of the group and rolls over GASPING for

ARMY PRIVATE (cont‘d)
The belt Wheres the grenade belt

Ray looks up at him and raises his right hand which is balled up
into a fist He opens it up revealing a gronade pin in his palm
Its at that moment --

FHE EXPLOSION COMES

Its two explosions really the first being one grenade going
off and the other a split-second later much bigger as the rest
of the grenades on the belt explede as a result

The shell of the Tripodsa head explodes outward but does not
burst absorbing most of the blast within its strong walls

But the Tripod itself lurches staggers lika a punchy boxer

(All of this is seen from inside the crazily bouncing basket)
The basket rocks violently the Tripod SLAMS into a tree on one
side veers off and its front leg telescopes halfway down all at
once a8 if the thing is going to its knee

Now rudderless driverless the Tripeds right rear leg attempts
two consecutive strides and the whole thing pitches forward

The ground races up at them fast and they SLAM into the earth
dixt and mud flying everywhere obscuring our vision and sending
up a thick cloud of debris

146-159 OMITTED 146-159

all we seo at first is a mass of mud The mud starts to move

arms and legs coma out of it somebodys head human beings
crawling out of the cose coming back to life

We see Rachels face first as she opens her eyes shes no longer
in the basket which has been wrenched free from the Tripod
wreckaga by the violence of the fall

The other bodies near her ara moving too evarybody oozing out of
the mud into which they have fallen

Theres GASPING CRYING But thoyre alive One of the bodies
rells over near Rachel and she finds herself face to faca -

BOSTON 12
CUT TO
OMITTED DAY 162
BxT BOSTON - THE OLD CITY DAY 163

A once-busy street in the heart of Boston Theres not a soul to
be seen but destruction is everywhere -- rows and rows of empty
human clothing in the stroats where bodies wara vaporized a
geyser of water spowing from a sheared fire hydrant no one was
there to cap an overturned bus at the end of the street The
front of a whole block of stores has been burned off One a
jewelry store seems to have exploded into the strest leaving
expensive rings watchos and necklaces strewn everywhere But
no one has bothered to pick them up they dont maan much
anymore

The street stratches far into the distance toward the river and
bridges far beyond and its the same empty lonely story as far
as the oye can see The most striking thing about the city is its
stillness

And everywhere the red weed on buildings on trees evaryvhore
Theres something different about it here something off but we
dont have time to give it much thought as Ray and Rache) come
around the corner and onto this abandoned block

Ray looks down at the water rushing through the street The
gutters are swollen with red weed huge rolling bundles of it all
slong the water

But Ray looks closer because the red weed is driod out and
breaking Great branches of it SNAP off and are swept into tho
gushing stream carried away by the same waters that initially
od it

Thats weird Ray turns to a patch of weed that has grown off 4
tree on the sidewalk and SNAPS off a chunk of it Its covered in
white spots something like tonsillitis He bends it It‘s
brittle and SHAPS in half at the slightest pressure

Rachel leans over his shoulder and looks at the spots too

163 163

RACHEL
It looks sick

RAY
More than sick Its dead Or dying
anyway
ULLAI”
Ray whirls hearing the sound of a Tripod calling out in the

distance but its bouncing off so many buildings they can’t tell
where it came from Rachel instinctively grabs hold of him

The sound comes again at regular intervals They set off down
the narrow streets of the city in the opposite direction

164 OMITTED 164
164A BET BOSTON - INDUSTRIAL AREA DAY 164a
Ray and Rachol come around another corner and find a pack of

birds pecking at the pods that have grown from tho red wood But
the peds are split open now raw and fleshy and exposed lying in
tha street
Ray and Rachel keep moving

165 EXT BOSTON - INDUSTRIAL AREA DAY 165
Ray and Rachel come around another corner and stop suddenly
fhe head of a Tripod is crashed in front of them
Its buried noso-first in the middle of the street A hatch is
partially open underneath its front the lower lip of a slack-
jawed mouth

Qver and over it BLEATS its recorded mechanical cry and we
realize why it sounded so plaintive -- it was calling for help

Ray and Rachel pass the frozen Tripod waved along by a SOLDIER

SOLDIER 1
Keep moving Its all right you can
pass on through Move along

RAY
walking with Soldier)
What happened hare

SOLDIER 1
Somethings happening to them Please
keep moving

165 CONTIBUED 165

RAY
Did you guys take it down

SOLDIER 1
Ho sir it was behaving erratically
Walking in oircles and went down about
an hour ago all by itself

RACHEL
Is it dead

Ray
Yes Dont stop

RACHEL
Bow ie it dead all by itself

RAY
Rachel I dont know

Suddenly ANOTHER TRIPOD perhaps coming to the aide of its
fallen comrade emerges from the end of the street behind then
and walks forward Staggers forward is more accurate its
barely able to stay on its feet It SMASHES into the side of
gnother building bouncing off and taking another unsteady step
forward

VOICES rise up from around them PEOPLE emarging from the mouths
of alleys from buildings from side streets -- a tentative
trickle at first but there are more SOLDIERS separated from
their units but still fighting

The Tripod takes another step forward shakily about to go down
THREE SOLDIERS take shelter on the alley wall opposite Ray and
Rachel

As Ray watches a BIRD circles around the head of the Tripod
then lands on it Ray furrows his brow thinking Now three more
birds land on top of the Tripods head

Ray thinks theres something off about this hes seen something
like it hes trying to remember and then his eyes light up
He turns to the Soldiers and sHOUTS

RAY (contd)
Look at the birds

But just as he speaks the Triped emits one of those piercing
cries of “ULLA and Ray‘s line is inaudible wa can only read
8 lips

SOLDIER
What 165

RAY
(mow audible again)
Look at the birds Look at the God damn
birds

The Soldiers all turn and look but another “ULLA® blocks out
Rays next line

RAY (contd)
(blocked out by the ULLA)
No shield
SOLDIER
What

Ray SHOUTS again and this time his words burst through and the
Soldier ig able to hear and understand him

RAY
NO SHIBLD

The Soldier who carries a shoulder-borne missile launcher
quickly realizes what this meana and --

SOLDIER
LOAD

- another Soldier shoves a shell into the launcher Ray whirls
and covers Rachel with his body as the shell ERUPTS out of the
tube and SLAMS into the side of the Tripod

The resulting EXPLOSION is huge and effective The Tripods
hull RIPS apart with a SHRIEK of torn metal Rose-colored fluid
showers everywhere the thing belches lifeblood and the Tripod
pitches forward first to one knee and then careening all the
way down SMASHING into the middle of tha streot

Buddenly theres a commotion and the crowd of people around the
first Tripod the one with the hatchway hanging open leaps back
as one but crowds around it

Ray moves forward Theres movement coming from inside the head
of the crashed Tripod something slithering down that hatchway

Its the forelimb of one of the invaders moving weakly near
death trying to drag the bulky body down inte the street

But it has no strength left its covered in sickly white spots
like the red weed Ray studies it realizing something

RACHEL
What happened Did they get sick 165
RAY
Yes they did
RACHEL
What from
RAY

Our germs Maybe infection stuff
wore immune to that our bedies fight
off every day

The creeping forelimb stops dead still halfway in its ship

RAY (contd)
After overything we fought ‘em with
they died from tha air we breathe and
the water we drink All the things we
nead to live thats what killed then

PEOPLE advance slowly toward the hood of the Tripod incredulous
and hopeful and now more humans emerge from their hiding places
crowding the streets

CUT TO
OMITTED 166
ExT BOSTON - BROWNSTONE BLOCK DAY 167

A neat row of townhouses in one of the oldest parts of Boston We
settle on the front door of one particular house we move in
toward it and just as wo reach it the front door is yanked open
and Mary Ann is standing there the kids‘ mom alive and well
She looks right at us and her face breaks with emotion her hands
go involuntarily to her mouth she rushes forward into the street
and finds Ray at the base of the stairs carrying Rachel the last
few yards to her mother

Ray smiles deeply satisfied but feeling so keenly the loss of
Robbie But then a pair of scuffed boots appear on the floor
behind Mary Ann and Rachel and Ray follows them up disbelieving
and of course the person standing there behind them is --

RACHEL
ROBBIE

It ig Robbie bruised and battered but very much alive standing
there in the doorway of his mothers house He runs down the
stairs kind of falls forward into the street into his fathers
arms

167

They hug each other and Rachel hugs them both Robbie finally
breaks down the first time weve seen him crying and in his
sobs we hear a word we havent heard him say before

ROBBIE
eee Dad

Robbie pulls away from his dad and goes to the doorway drops to
bis knees and holds his littla sister and his mom Ray watches
incredulous moved to tears looking at his children

Mary Ann looks up over the shoulders of Rachel and Robbie Tears
stream from her eyes she makes eye contact with Ray and mouths
two words -- Thank you”

Tim appears in the hallway behind them and their grandmother
too hurrying down the stairs at the sound of the voices

thay all look at Ray thanking him with their eyes and beckoning
him inside He walks up the steps the door closes op all of
them and an enormous CLAHG --

axr BOSTOR STREET DAY 166

-- echoes as a BELL peals in the tower of a church steople The
heavy iron clapper SWISHES through frame and CLANGS again off the
side of the bell

The VOICE OVER from the beginning returns as we start to rise up
the steeple of the church at the end of the block shining gold in
the morning sun

As vo keop rising higher its only the second big global view
of things weve seen in the movie -- this time the morning sun
burns through the clouds over the skyline of Boston In the
distance the forms of Tripods are visible dotting the streota
everywhere But none of them are moving Theyre crashed or
heeled over on their sides stopped in their tracks

We keep rising up and up over the neighborhood and we sea four
or five church steeples in this old part of Boston all with
their bells TOLLING jubilantly calling SURVIVORS back into the
streots

The branches of a treo come into frame and as we move in among
the branchos wo nero in on a leaf woving closer we ses its
covered with drops of water The VOICE OVER from tho beginning
comes ch

VOICE From the moment the invaders arrived
breathed our air ate and drank they
were doomed

(MORE)

VOICE (08 (contd)
They wera undone destroyed after all of
humanitys weapons and devices had
failed by the tiniest creatures that
God in his wisdom put upon this earth

We keep moving toward one drop in particular and within that
drop wa see the wriggling outlines of the tiny micro-organisms
that swarm and multiply within it

VOICE (CONT’D)

By the toll of a billion deaths we have
earned our immunity our right to
survive among thie planets infinite
organisms --

As we go closer and closer and closer still the drop fills the
frame and we see the tens of thousands of squirming bacteria
inside that drop of water and we think about how truly
significant they really are

VOICE (CONTD)

- and that right 4s ours against all
challengers Yor neither do ve live nor
die in vain
