15 YEAR OLD DONNY

at me in my gym shorts It’s okay
Let yourself have this

He kisses his bicep
MARY MCGARRICLE
Quite a swagger you have there
young man But I’m your teacher

15 YEAR OLD DONNY
Whoa whoa Miss McGarricle who
said anything about “girlfriend”
Let’s just start with a summer
fling - a couple of HJ’s rock the
wild thang no expectations - see
where it goes Don’t get all psycho
on me right away

His buddies laugh -- Mary McGarricle’s pissed

MARY MCGARRICLE
If by “HJ’s” you mean “handjobs” I
usually only give handjobs to guys
that’ve gone through puberty

BUDDIES

means

15 YEAR OLD DONNY
(goes red embarrassed)
Oh yeah Wellum
(PULLS down his shorts

Mary leans in closer to him

MARY MCGARRICLE

time You may have the pubic mound
of a fifteen-year-old but I can
see in your eyes that you have a
soul of a man

15 YEAR OLD DONNY
(insanely nervous)

CHAMPALE
This could be a blessing in
disguise Your son’s getting
married Go and reconcile with him
be honest about your situation and

EXT MANHATTAN - UPPER EAST SIDE TOWNHOUSE - SAME

CLOSE ON TODD with the same awkward smile looking at
himself in the mirror in his walk-in closetdressing area

TODD
(nervous )
Natural Relaxed Big weekend Just
keep it together Just don’t be
yourself

He pops a Xanax then takes out a SPARE PAIR OF UNDERWEAR
from a drawer and puts it in his inside jacket pocket

Todd pulls a shirt from his suffocatingly neat color-coded
closet as STACEY (24 attractive) skips in

STACEY
How excited are you right now

TODD
Id say off the charts or like
right at the edge of the charts

She shows him the New York Times announcement

TODD (CONTD) (contd)
Wow I just - I still don’t get why
we did this Who announces their
wedding in the paper I feel like
that only happens on “Sex and the
City”

STACEY
It’s the cover of the Memorial Day
weekend wedding section Forget us

(no response )
C’mon look how great we look

TODD

We look like your typical perfect
happy couple I always dreamed
about opening up the paper and
seeing my wedding announcement

TODD
I just - I mean this thing’s got
our names and our picture I just
don’t want people knowing how
tofind us

STACEY
How to find us Honey did you take
your Xanax today

TODD
Yes Two

STACEY
Did you have your spare underpants

TODD
There are weirder things then
carrying an extra pair for an
emergency

STACEY
I’m sure there are

TODD
Like there’s a guy at my office
he NEVER eats bread

STACEY
Maybe he’s on a no-carb diet

TODD
I could find out

The INTERCOM buzzes

STACEY
That’s Mom and Dad with Antonio

TODD
How many times do we have to meet
with that wedding coordinator He
rubs me the wrong way

STACEY
Were lucky to have Antonio He’s
the the best His waiting list is
over a year long and without my
mom pulling strings we would have
never gotten him

TODD
Okay okay I do want this weekend
to be perfect

STACEY

They WRESTLE clumsily

INT TODD’S MERCEDES - LATER

Todd drives Donny’s in shotgun in a shirt and tie “Your
Body is a Wonderland” plays on the stereo

DONNY
This music sounds like what Phil
Collins would put on before he
makes love to Richard Marx

TODD
Yeah well John Mayer’s sold about
30 million records so you don’t
know what you’re talking about

DONNY
What I’m talking about is Phil
Collins putting this song on
before he takes off his Rugby
shirt and fucks Richard Marx
God sometimes I can’t believe you
came outta my penis I’ve got two
words for you Spring Steen
Listen to him

TODD
I’ve actually heard Bruce
Springsteen It was playing in the
house constantly for the first 18
years of my life

DONNY
Maybe you’ve heard him but you’ve
never really listened to him Do
yourself a favor Really listen to
just one song

Donny pulls out a CASSETTE TAPE “Springsteen Intro Mix”
Todd takes the tape and kinda BANGS it against his stereo

TODD
Oh wait that’s right I left my
tape player in 1987 I’1l go back
in time and get it for you

(MORE )

TODD (contd)
And while I’m there I’1l pick you
up another pair of those jeans

a while

HELEN

Let’s go inside

INT MAGNIFICENT CHURCH - LATER

Todd anxiously stares up at a HUGE BLOODY crucifix above the
altar

An ANGRY PRIEST prepares to address the WEDDING PARTY

Antonio watches from the side

ANGRY PRIEST

ANGRY PRIEST

Peterson I’m hooked in

DONNY
Is this a funeral

ANGRY PRIEST
Best man is that a real question

DONNY
No I was just kidding You know

The Priest just continues annoyed

ANGRY PRIEST
Marriage is serious Now then the
choir will begin you’1ll come down
the aisle pause at the altar
genuflect then move to the side
Everyone got that

Donny raises his hand -- the Priest looks at him annoyed

DONNY
Sorry just wanna be clear By
genuflect you mean “think about
how great it is that they’re
getting married” right

ANGRY PRIEST
Noby “genuflect” I mean bow to
one knee and make the signal of the
cross

DONNY
Right Got it So should Todd and
I do that too though

ANGRY PRIEST
What do you mean

TODD
Wait Don --

DONNY
Cause we’re Jewish

Everyone’s stunned
DONNY (CONT’D) (contd)
I mean I don’t care I’m a team
player on this thing What do we do
here (making sign of the cross)
Up down left right Isn’t that
how you guys do the thing

Everyone looks at Todd -- he laughs nervously
TODD
Donny I’m not Jewish I’m
Catholic
DONNY

(tries to recover)
Oh yeahright I always get
those two mixed up

ANGRY PRIEST
(suspicious)
Mr Peterson when was your last
communion

TODD

(laughingstalling)
“When was my last communion” Is
this guy kidding Stacey do you
hear this He’s asking when my last
communion was Now that’s funny I
mean Jay Leno might want to step
aside and let this guy do the
jokes Ha “When was your last
communion”

ANGRY PRIEST
What is communion

TODD
You know

ANGRY PRIEST
Yes I do know

TODD
It’slike a dance ritual

Priest stares head shaking

TODD (cont’d)

Metaphorically
(MORE )

TODD (contd)
(beat )
It’s open to interpretation

Off the Angry Priest’s angry look --

EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER

Donny Troy and the parents stand to the side as Stacey and
Todd argue

STACEY
You lied to me

TODD
Yesbut out of love I knew it
was important to your family It
was a love lie Like faking an
orgasm

HELEN
(coming over)
He’1ll just have to convert Father
Kelly can baptize him right before
the ceremony

TODD
Wait like convert like convert my
religion Isn’t the fact that we
love each other enough

STACEY
Yes as long as you get baptized
before the wedding and become a
catholic

TODD
Okay so love isn’t enough

STACEY
I’m not the one who lied

Stacey gets in a taxi with her family
HELEN
(to Todd)

You’re really disappointing me

TODD
Helen

HELEN
Mrs Hayward is fine

Before getting in the cab Troy whispers into Todd’s ear

TROY
Ask me how many men I’ve killed in
combat
TODD
How many men have you killed in
combat
TROY
(whispering even quieter)
« Six

He jumps in the cab and they’re off leaving a furious Todd
alone with Donny outside the church

DONNY
I’m sorry man but you didn’t give
me a handbook with all the things
youre lying about you know And
who lies about being Jewish Even
just from a business standpoint
youre leaving a ton of clients on
the table

TODD
I guess I should have told you I
was pretending to be a goy But now
I guess I’m actually gonna be one

DONNY
Well wait a minute don’t let
anyone tell you what to do You
need to decide for yourself By
blood you’re half-n-half but you
were raised as a Jew

TODD
Hardly

DONNY
What are you talking about Don’t
you remember your Bar Mitzva

TODD
As I recall you threw a party at
the house with all of YOUR friends
and at the end you told me it was
my Bar Mitzva

DONNY
Did you or did you not have your
first beer that night
TODD
I did

DONNY
So you became a man That my son
is the Talmudic definition Bar

Mitzva
TODD
What is “Talmudic”
DONNY
(no idea)

It’s Jewish

TODD
Uh huh I might as well become a
Catholic

DONNY

Hey your call Your mom is
Catholic so I support whatever
decision you make

TODD
It’s not like being Jewish did
anything for you

DONNY
But I want you to be a better
person than me

TODD
Maybe Ill start by not
impregnating my 7th grade teacher

DONNY
Okay that’s a great start What
else

TODD

Do something good for the
community Maybe work in a soup
kitchen

DONNY
TWO great ideas

They LAUGH together for the first time in a decade

TODD
(laughing)
Who am I kidding
(MORE)

TODD (contd)
I’m neurotic mess -- I have to stay
Jewish I’m not converting

DONNY
That’s my boy the Levines live on
Mazel Tov

Todds cell phone rings The ring tone is Britney Spears “Hit
Me Baby One More Time” Donny’s look says “are you kidding”

TODD (INTO PHONE)
Hi honey I know I’m sorry too
Yes I promise Yeah uh huh
Because I was thinking maybe
-uh huhokayokay I will I

Todd hangs up

TODD (contd)
That was Lisa

DONNY
You’re converting

TODD
Yep

INT TUX SHOP - LATER
A TAILOR fits Donny and Todd for TUXES

DONNY
I was thinking what if instead of
“whipped cream” they called it
“pussy whipped cream”

TAILOR
Hold still arms by your side

TODD
She’s not really wrong on this
Don I lied to her

DONNY
No I wasn’t thinking about the way
you let your fiancé cut your balls
off It was a completely separate
thought about whether they should
call whipped cream “pussy-whipped
cream”
TODD
So Ill be Catholic what’s the big
deal Al Roker’s Catholic and he
seems very happy

DONNY
How do you know that

TODD
Stacey and I are obsessed with the
Today Show We TiVo it every day

DONNY
Really

TODD
Oh yeah Matt Lauer’s Protestant
Meredith Vieira’s Methodist
Willard Scott’s Unitarian and Gene
Shalit’s a Jew

DONNY
I’m sold You’re obvoiusly a Today-
o-phile Look I don’t care if
youre Jewish or not I just hate
seeing you twist yourself into a
pretzel just so some rich family
thinks you’re like them

TODD
You see in an adult relationship
you make sacrifices for each other
It’s not always about you

DONNY
Ehh gonna have to agree to
disagree on that one

TAILOR
(re Donny’s pants crotch)
How’s this

DONNY
Let’s go a little tighter Don’t be
afraid to get up in there

TODD
I should have just been honest with
Stacey in the first place

DONNY
Absolutely So hey are you coming
with me to see your Mom tomorrow
before her big operation

TODD
I don’t even know the woman
Haven’t seen her since I was a
little kidCan you imagine what
what it would be like to be locked
up in a jail cell

DONNY
Trying not to think about it

TODD
Day in day out the world goes by
without you

DONNY
Please come with me tomorrow Todd
Please I’m begging you

TODD
(re Donny’s pants)
Whoa those are way too tight It’s
a tux not a wet-suit

DONNY
I could go even tighter Todd

TODD
Don I can literally see the rim of
your penis

DONNY
Barely

A shot of Donny’s crotch - like a penis in shrink wrap

TODD
I’1l go

DONNY
You’1l go

TODD

Yes Ill go with you tomorrow to
see Miss McGarricle As long as
we’re back by noon

DONNY
(hugging him)
Wow thank you that’s my boy

TAILOR
Okay take a look Two handsome
gentlemen

Todd and Donny look in the mirror side by side in their
tuxes Donny puts his arm around Todd Todd shakes it off

TAILOR (contd)
By the way I’ve given some thought
to the “pussy-whipped cream” idea
I don’t think it would pass muster
in most grocery stores because
“pussy” sometimes means “vagina”

EXT MAGNOLIA BAKERY - LATER

Todd and Donny wait in an insanely long line outside the
famous tiny bakery

DONNY
25 minutes on a line for cupcakes
How good can they possibly be

Some PATRONS look at Donny oddly

TODD
Stacey loves them and it’s my go-
to apology gift Stacey would
rather eat a Magnolia red velvet
then have me eat her out

DONNY
God I hate Manhattan

They finally reach the counter

TODD
We’ll take a dozen red velvets

MAGNOLIA CLERK
That’1l be 3155

Donny makes a ridiculously fake “attempt” to find his wallet
patting all over his body Todd just watches him -- which
forces Donny to keep the charade going for a while

TODD
Alright Alligator Arms take it
easy I got it

DONNY
What I was legitimately looking
for my wallet

They get the cupcakes and make their way out

EXT BLEECKER STREET - CONTINUOUS

DONNY

I’m the best man and I’m putting
my foot down This is NOT a
bachelor party We shouldn’t be
drinking cucumber juice

PHIL
Correction Donny it’s not juice
It’s water infused with cucumber
sandalwood--

Donny takes a BAMBOO STICK from a stack of them leaning
against the wall

DONNY
And these bamboo sticks everywhere
Who cares if they’re imported from
China All the shittiest stuff is
from China right

PHIL

with the US in the manufacture of
quality--

DONNY
--Are you done

DONNY
Yes I do What the fuck guys This
is Donny’s last night of freedom
and we’re getting manicures And
massages with sad endings This is
his last time up to the plate as a
free man Bases are loaded Do you

He holds the bamboo stick like it’s a baseball bat

DONNY (contd)
You swing for the fences You get
all Albert Pujois on it You see

up and you CRUSH IT

baseball bat to a ceramic SPHERE that’s part of one of the
sculptures

cracks multiplying

TODD
You really want to be a stripper
Isnt that a hard life

BRIE
Listen my Mom’s been doing it for
60-odd years now and she’s always
had enough money to keep a roof
over our heads she paid for me to
go to Jersey State And look at
her

They watch Champale pressing Phill’s face between her legs

CHAMPALE
Don’t be shy boy Get a good look

BRIE
She’s still excited to wake up
every day and live her life How
many people can say that

TODD
Not me

BRIE
For years I worked as a legal
secretary hoping I’d be a lawyer
someday

TODD
Oh that sounds like a good goal
Lawyers definitely make a lot of
money and--

BRIE
But I hated it Todd

TODD
(backtracking)
Ooh I know Lawyers are scumbags
It’s like the old joke - what’s the
difference between a lawyer and a
snake

BRIE
What What’s the difference

TODD
I don’t remember the punchline but
essentially it’s like a lawyer is
uh like a snake or something
along those lines

BRIE
Right exactly And that’s no fun
so I thought “Screw it - I’1ll work
in a dirty strip club off the
Jersey Turnpike and let people
judge me Because guess what I’d
take my mom’s life sans the heroin
addiction any day I’m happy and
they’re not

TODD
Hard to argue with happiness
Although crippling depression has
its merits too Both have pros and
cons

Brie laughs

TODD (contd)
I don’t know why I’m telling you
this but I have to carry around a
second pair of underwear
BRIE
You are so funny

DONNY (cont’d)
Youve gotten the wrong idea about
Springsteen

TODD
I know Bruce Springsteen Bon
Jovi

DONNY
Already you’re way off Two totally
different things I mean I love
Jovi don’t get me wrong I also
like a good burger but when I want
a steak I don’t go to a burger
place you know Springsteen is
filet mingon served on a white
table cloth by a condescening old
man in a bow tie The man wrote
“Thunder Road”

first wedding dance - it’s
embarrassing that it’s not but I

He looks through his tapes

DONNY (cont’d)
There’s so many ways into this I
could hit you with “Nebraska” but
too sad as a starter “Greetings”

Innocent” You’re gonna wanna be
buried with all of them but

He holds one tape up up

DONNY (cont’d)
“Born To Run” When my LaserTag
franchise went under and you were
eating all the money I had left
this is the only thing that stroked
my hair and said “Shhhhh”

TODD
At least when the LaserTag shut
down we had all that frozen pizza
for the next few years

DONNY
So finally it hit me

He holds up “THE RIVER”

DONNY (cont’d)
The River The year you ran away I
wore out three copies of this tape
Fact The River is about every-
body’s life ever That’s what The
Boss does best He writes about
your life Literally

affect me now I couldnt even
conceive of being 42 years old
then But I was doing this secret
made me feel special My friends
were all virgins I mean except for
Tyler Monroe but he was born in
Europe so that’s different

I’m telling you there was still
something real there
