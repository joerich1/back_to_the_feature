FADE IN
EXT LIMBO - DAYNIGHT

A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable And
out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes flying

the camera in slow motion

SARAH (0S)
I believe theres a place where the restless souls wander

by the weight of their own sadness they cannot enter

Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON

A warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony
mask war paint

SARAH (0S)
And so they wait trapped between our world and the next

searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
hopes that somehow some day

The figure on horseback sweeps past us disappearing once

into the mists of time

Sarah fingers the ring a moment glancing at the irony mask

peels it off she catches sight of

in a shadowed entryway Its a TEENAGED GIRL strung
out

on drugs The girl cowers in a narrow stairway hugging
herself

shivering from withdrawal

Sarah draws closer notices some of the grinning imp drug
sachets
at the girls feet The girl shies away frightened
suspicious

is gone The only think that remains for Ashe is an
animal fury

Ashe launches himself at Judah sending the villain tumbling
back into a nest of scaffolding One of the pipes punches

through Judahs chest impaling him
Judah hangs there transfixed like a butterfly with a pin
through it He struggles to pull himself from the piping

even so hes laughing hysterically

JUDAH

You cant stop me anymore Ashe You dont have the power

Ashes eyes boil with hatred

ASHE
If it were just me youd be right Judah But I have an

of pain to call upon

Ashe lifts his hands up exposing his bleeding palms

ASHE

And the pain gives me strength

EXT JUDAHS CAMPANILE - NIGHT

The murder of crows spirals down from the sky like a black
wave They descend on Judah as one entity SCREAMING down

the heavens like a storm of razor blades

JUDAH

NO

We get one final glimpse of horrified Judahs face eyes

with terror before the tidal wave of black wings engulfs

JUDAH

lets loose a DEATH-SHRIEK that all but splits the sky as the
myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb

DOWN IN THE STREET
Ashe returns to Sarahs side lifting her up off the ground

cradling her in his arms

Sarah looks up at Ashe tries her level best to smile Shes

at deaths door now - one foot already over the threshold
Her

face is pale having lost so much blood Tears spill down
Ashes

cheeks causing the war-paint makeup to run in rivulets

ASHE

Sarah reaches down to the wedding ring which hangs from her

SARAH

Takethis

Ashe takes the ring from Sarah She closes Ashes hand

the ring gripping his fist tightly

SARAH

Ill wait for you Forever if I have to

She shuts her eyes riding through another wave of pain

ASHE

Oh God

SARAH

Listenif two people really love each other

She inhales sharply Breathing has become a labor for her

SARAH

nothing can keep them apart
(her voice fading)

nothing

Ashe nods trying to let this thought reassure him Its the
only thing he has left to cling to

SARAHS POV

Ashes face surrounded by a nimbus of light Were falling
away

from him Down down down And as we fall we hear a
FLUTTERING

OF WINGS

ON SARAHS FACE

Her eyes lose focus Her head goes slack in Ashes arms

gone

Ashe lowers his lips to her kissing her one final time

Ashe cradles Sarahs lifeless body in his arms gently
rocking

back and forth tears streaming down his cheeks

And as we pull back from them we realize that the scene
mirrors

the prophetic image from Sarahs own painting - the woman
dying

in the arms of her lover surrounded by a gallery of skull-
masked

celebrants

Ashe stands lifting Sarah in his arms He turns to leave

EXT INNER-CITY CHURCH - DAWN

The same church we visited the night before Ashe still
Sarah in his arms enters the sanctuary

The church is aglow with candles Ashe lays Sarahs body

in front of the offrenda folding her arms across her chest
leaving her in a state of repose He stands taking in one

look
As Ashe moves to leave he sees the elderly priest he had

to earlier

PRIEST

Why are you still here

ASHE

Because I have nowhere left to go

Ashe steps past the priest moving towards the doorway and

daylight beyond

PRIEST

What will you do then

ASHE

This city is filled with shadows One more wont make it any
darker

Ashe exits the church finding haven in a shadowed doorway
He

reaches into his pocket removing the wedding ring Sarah had

given to him

CLOSE ON THE RING
as Ashe turns it over in his hands seeing the word

inscribed on the inside of the band He slips it on his
finger

GRACE (0S)
(CONCERNED)

Are you all right

Ashe looks up to see
GRACE

the drugged-out girl that Sarah helped at the beginning of
the

film Shes looking good now clean of the poison that once
possessed

her And damned if she isnt holding Gabriel in her arms

She smiles at him and starts off down the street Gabriel

around in Graces arms and peers back at Ashe from over her

Ashe moves out from the shadows into the steadily growing

watching them We see just a hint of hope in his eyes - hope
that someday he and Sarah will be reunited

As we hold on Ashes face Sarahs VOICE-OVER begins
