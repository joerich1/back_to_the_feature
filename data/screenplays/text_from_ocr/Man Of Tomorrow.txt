INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Waiters glide among the tables of a dimly lit restaurant The
decor is elegant timeless Somewhere a piano plays

We find HARRIGAN shoveling a porterhouse steak into his
mouth Late fifties rumpled and messy with hooded eyes and
a suit that’s faded to the color of dirty dishwater

Harrigan skewers his next bite Doesn’t even glance up when
someone takes a seat across from him

HARRIGAN
Heard about Al Hell of a thing

TOMMY ANDERS regards him coldly The difference between the
two men couldn’t be more striking Tommy is powerfully built
perhaps as young as 30 with chiseled features and piercing
blue eyes A tailored black suit that screams money

TOMMY
The answer’s no

Harrigan spears another bite waggles it in the air

HARRIGAN
Here’s what I don’t get about you
Tommy You read the papers you’re
a smart guy You see where this is
going How long you figure before
it’s our boys over there huh
Couple months maybe

TOMMY
They’re not my boys

HARRIGAN

No I’m serious take a look
around How many people in this
room are gonna die That waiter
he’s about the right age Some
beach in France he’s just getting
off the transport and zzzzzzip--

(he mimics a gunshot)
There goes his guts all over the
mud And he’s crying out for mama
and his buddies they’re dying all
around him and you coulda stopped
it That don’t bother you at all

TOMMY
Are we done here

Harrigan shakes his head in disgust
HARRIGAN
Yeah Yeah we’re done
(pretending to remember)
Oh there was one thing Got a
question I’m supposed to ask

The old guy still has a flair for the dramatic He pauses to
light a cheap cigar takes a few puffs exhales greasy smoke
through his teeth Never taking his eyes off Tommy

HARRIGAN
What are you missing

TOMMY
(sighs)
I don’t know Agent Harrigan Why
don’t you tell me

HARRIGAN
That’s the thing I don’t know
They tell me give Tommy whatever
he wants So I say you’re wasting
your time Because this guy--this
miserable cowardly piece of shit
of a man--he doesn’t even remember
what that feels like To want
something you can’t have

Tommys smile hardens These are dangerous waters

HARRIGAN
Only that don’t go over so well
You can imagine My boss he says
to me everyone wants something
Except he says it more poetic-like
“Every life has a piece thats
still missing His words right
not mine So

TOMMY
You want me to name my price

Harrigan leans forward His voice dropping an octave

HARRIGAN
I want you to surprise me You
don’t care about saving all them
lives Fine Then give me something
better Because I swear to God you
tell me “all the gold in Fort
Knox” I’1l come across this table
and kill you myself

Tommy actually smiles at this
TOMMY
Is that right

HARRIGAN
(takes another drag)

I ever tell you my old man he
used to be a fight promoter
Anyway he had this theory When
its tough versus mean always bet
on the mean one ‘Cuz tough goes
down once Mean gets back up

Tommy steeples his fingers Regards Harrigan thoughtfully

TOMMY
Chicago

HARRIGAN
Chicago

TOMMY

Is my price

HARRIGAN
Well How about that

TOMMY
Surprised

Harrigan smiles enigmatically Doesn’t answer the question

HARRIGAN
Assuming you’ve got terms

TOMMY
Consider this a formal secession
Chicago no longer recognizes the
authority of the United States or
that of any other government

HARRIGAN
Mmm Anything else

TOMMY
Full pardons and diplomatic
immunity for my organization My
men can’t be touched

Harrigan gestures to the other patrons around them

HARRIGAN
What about them
TOMMY
Anyone who wants to leave will be
free to go You have my word

Harrigan abruptly stands tugs on his overcoat

TOMMY
Well

HARRIGAN
Well what Enjoy your city

TOMMY
No haggling Just like that

HARRIGAN
You just traded the whole world for
a pile of gold bricks And I want
you to understand that’s exactly
what you did Far as I’m concerned
We got ourselves a bargain

TOMMY
If that’s true I guess it means
youll have to kill me

Harrigan smiles Like this thought only just occurred to

HARRIGAN
Huh Guess it does

(stubbing out his cigar)
Plane’s waiting at Midway You
leave in two hours Unless you
wanna fly yourself

TOMMY
I told you I can’t fly

HARRIGAN
Yeah that’s what you keep saying
See you later Tommy

And with that Harrigan turns and strides away

INT UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NIGHT

him

A battalion of SOLDIERS in black uniforms are huddled behind
a makeshift barricade Staring at a REINFORCED METAL DOOR

From beyond the door we hear a barrage of SHARP GUNFIRE

SCREAMS MUFFLED EXPLOSIONS Pure carnage
Soldiers double-check their safeties Sweat prickling on
their brows Trying to steady their shaking hands

WHOOM Another explosion Right outside the door

We drift down the hall until we reach the end of the
corridor and the small man huddled there

It’s ADOLF HITLER

The Fiihrer licks his lips Addresses his bodyguards
HITLER
Jeder Mann der sein Amt am Wiisten
Anblick wird erschossen

INT REICH CHANCELLERY - SIMULTANEOUS

The Reich Chancellery Base of operations for the Nazi war
machine located in the heart of Berlin

And currently under siege from just one man

Tommy strides calmly across the domed rotunda garbed in
military combat gear He’s not carrying a weapon

Four NAZIS round the corner and open fire Tommy backhands
the nearest Nazi sending him CRASHING into the others--

Grabs another soldier chucks him fifty feet through the air--

HITLER (VO)
Sie kaémpfen heute fiir die
Herrlichkeit des Reiches

Tommy pivots smoothly revealing a German soldier on the far
end of the rotunda aiming a Panzerfaust rocket launcher--

TIME SEEMS TO SLOW DOWN as the rocket erupts from its launch
tube whistling toward Tommy--

Moving with impossible speed TOMMY SNATCHES THE ROCKET OUT
OF THE AIR AND WHIPS IT BACK ACROSS THE ROTUNDA The rocket
EXPLODES in mid-flight swallowing the Panzerfaust trooper in
a blossom of bright orange fire

HITLER (VO)
Sie kaémpfen fiir das Vaterland

Tommy whirls around again revealing DOZENS OF NAZI SOLDIERS
pouring down the twin staircases toward him From our vantage
point it looks like the entire goddamn German army
INT UNDERGROUND BUNKER - SIMULTANEOUS
Back in Hitler’s sealed bunker the dictator rages on
HITLER
Du hast nach Deutschland zu

kampfen

As if to punctuate this note the corridor outside suddenly
goes deathly SILENT

Hitler’s bodyguards exchange nervous glances Barely daring
to hope Could it really be over

Hitler exhales a shaky breath Then he smiles his confidence
returning He opens his mouth to speak--

With a sound like CASCADING THUNDER the reinforced steel
door is suddenly torn from its hinges--

AND TOMMY COMES CHARGING THROUGH

His uniform has been shredded the remnants smolderingbut
underneath his skin remains unmarked Eyes blazing

The German soldiers open fire a hailstorm of bullets--

But the bullets PING harmlessly off Tommy’s chest as he
continues to advance--

Hitler cowers against the far wall His voice becoming a
high reedy shriek

HITLER
Totet ihn Totet ihn tdtet ihn

WHAM Tommy’s boot slams into the frame his shadow falling
over the dictator as we SMASH CUT TO

TITLE CARD OVER A BLACK SCREEN

CHAPTER ONE THE TRAITOR

EXT CHICAGO OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

A MILITARY VAN rumbles down the interstate All four lanes
are deserted there’s not another vehicle in sight

The Chicago skyline looms on the horizon Only a few lights
glimmer among the skyscrapers The rest of the city is dark

FX NEW CHICAGO 1946

INT BACK OF VAN - CONTINUOUS

In the back two FBI agents--PHELPS and CREERY--watch over
the prisoners JOHN NELLY VIC FRANCIS and MOE SHANNON No
orange jumpsuits here the thugs are wearing top of the line
pinstripe suits smoking cigars laughing and joking

FRANCIS
-So Torrio’s in the penthouse
right we’re out in the hall and
we get this idea have a little
fun So we all start yelling--

Francis pauses produces a liquor flask from his jacket

PHELPS
Hey no booze

NELLY
What’re you gonna do arrest me

Derisive laughter all around Agents Phelps and Creery watch
helplessly as Francis takes a slug wipes his mouth

FRANCIS
Anyway the penthouse So we’re all
going it’s Tommy Tommys here
Just a gag you know Except
Torrio he doesn’t come out So we
open the door thinking hey maybe
he’s asleep Torrio’s not there We
look everywhere can’t find him
Then we notice the window’s open

SHANNON
Friggin’ Torrio

FRANCIS
Six stories up and the dumb son of
a bitch jumps You believe that

The criminals explode in laughter The two Bureau agents
exchange a sullen look
EXT BLOCKADE - MOMENTS LATER

The van rumbles to a stop before a barricade erected across
the interstate THUGS patrol the entrance to Chicago armed
to the teeth The message is immediately clear this city has
become a police state No one gets in No one gets out

A GUARD saunters up and shines a flashlight through the
window Revealing HARRIGAN behind the wheel

GUARD
You Harrigan

HARRIGAN
What do you think

GUARD
All right let him through

The gates are raised Harrigan puts the van in gear

And they enter New Chicago

EXT CHICAGO STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

“Ghost town” would be putting it mildly This is closer to
post-apocalyptic Half the buildings are little more than
burnt-out husks The road littered with abandoned cars
Nearly all the homes are without electricity

We glimpse a few residents here and there dirty and
frightened shrinking away from the glare of the headlights

The notable exceptions are the properties that clearly belong
to Tommy We pass taverns packed with rowdy gangsters
Upscale restaurants untouched by the devastation A
glittering casino neon lights blazing in the darkness

INT VAN - CONTINUOUS

This isn’t Harrigan’s first visit But the sight of the
ruined city still hits him like a punch to the gut

Beside him CONRAD shakes his head stunned The younger
agent is 26 years old slender and thoughtful

CONRAD
How do they stand it

HARRIGAN
Six years that’s a long time
Guess you get used to it

Ahead of them more vagrants scatter into the darkness like
rats fleeing a broom

EXT MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

A palatial estate sprawling excessive lit up like a
Christmas tree Harrigan parks the van

INT VAN - CONTINUOUS
Conrad reaches for the door but Harrigan stops him

HARRIGAN
We get in there you keep your
mouth shut let me do the talking
Don’t stare Don’t make eye
contact He doesn’t like that

INT MANSION ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

An ornate lobby lit from above by an enormous crystal
chandelier The floors are polished marble Impeccable

The three prisoners saunter inside the agents trailing
behind them Francis throws Harrigan an insolent grin

FRANCIS
Thanks for the ride boys

Conrad takes in his surroundings absorbing every detail--
Armed BODYGUARDS patrol the mansion with clockwork precision--
In the adjoining room a harem of BEAUTIFUL BORED-LOOKING
WOMEN are lounging and gossiping in low tones One spots
Conrad and throws him a devious wink He looks away quickly
The heavy oak doors swing open and Tommy comes striding
through Wearing a suit that probably cost more than

Harrigan’s last car He smiles at the sight of the agents

TOMMY
Harrigan

HARRIGAN
Tommy

Tommy extends a hand Harrigan hesitates before shaking it

TOMMY
Hope they didn’t give you too much
trouble

HARRIGAN

Just the usual

LILY (0S)
Tommy

They turn to find LILY DAVERS descending the staircase Early
20s Luminous eyes milky complexion Beautiful but fragile

LILY
Is everything okay

TOMMY
This is the guy from the Bureau I
was telling you about Agent
Harrigan Lily Davers

HARRIGAN
Ma’am

Conrad suddenly realizes Tommy is watching him intently He
drops his gaze at once but it’s already too late

Tommy saunters over Like a shark circling a wounded seal
Conrad keeps his eyes glued to the floor

TOMMY
Who’s the new meat

CONRAD
Wilson sir Conrad Wilson

Tommy steps closer Until they’re practically nose-to-nose

TOMMY
I Didn’t Ask You

The beat drags outConrad frozenno one dares to breathe--
TOMMY
(quietly)
Boo

Conrad can’t help it he jumps Tommy steps back laughing

HARRIGAN
Leave the kid alone Tommy

Still grinning Tommy heads for the stairs

TOMMY
Harrigan I want you to see this

INT LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

The air is somber rich with history Hundreds of priceless
first editions lining the bookshelves Harrigan surveys the
extravagance with a sour expression

HARRIGAN
You gotta put a leash on your boys
They killed four cops down there
Almost had a riot when we took ‘em
out of the station

TOMMY
Ill have a talk Here Look

Tommy carefully lowers a CHESSBOARD onto the desk Flashing
ivory and deep ebony intricately detailed

TOMMY
Handcrafted in Timor That’s real
ivory cost a fortune Go on sit

HARRIGAN
Eh I’m not in the mood

TOMMY
And I’m not asking Sit

With a sigh Harrigan takes his seat Makes the first move

HARRIGAN
Don’t you got guys for this

TOMMY
They always let me win

HARRIGAN
It’s not like I ever beat you

TOMMY
But you try

Harrigan advances his knight Tommy counters his every move
instantly relentlessly always without hesitation

TOMMY
Why do you think that is Out of
everyone you’re the one person who
isn’t scared of me

HARRIGAN
I dunno Tommy ‘Cuz I don’t give a
shit about chess

TOMMY
I’m not talking about chess

Tommy sweeps another piece off the board Harrigan scowls

Suddenly A FLASHBULB goes off blindingly bright Harrigan
looks up to see a PHOTOGRAPHER in the doorway

TOMMY
Thanks Marco

The photographer bobs his head disappears out the door

HARRIGAN
The hell was that

TOMMY
I’m forming a publicity department
Counter some of the negative press
Show that I’m willing to work with
your government

HARRIGAN
And what do you think’s gonna
happen to me huh People see me
playing chess with Tommy Anders

Tommy shrugs innocently

TOMMY
I guess I never thought of that
Your move

HARRIGAN
(standing)
Nah I think we’re done here--

TOMMY
SIT DOWN

Tommys voice becomes sharp dangerous Harrigan reluctantly
lowers himself back into the chair A moment of silence

Harrigan takes a closer look Notices Tommy’s bloodshot eyes
The slight tremor in his hand when he reaches for a piece

HARRIGAN
(quietly)
What’s going on here Tommy

TOMMY
Check

HARRIGAN
Forget the game--

TOMMY
Check

Harrigan sighs Moves his King Tommy immediately counters

TOMMY
Check

Harrigan simply stares at him Until Tommy gives in

TOMMY
Erinyes

(The name is pronounced Aaron-EASE not EE-rin-YES In case
you were wondering)

HARRIGAN
That supposed to mean something

TOMMY

Someone’s been killing my men
Leaving that name behind all over
town It means “The Three Furies”

(Harrigan shrugs)
In Greek mythology the Furies were
supernatural beings Objects of
divine vengeance against those who
shed innocent blood

HARRIGAN
Sounds like you got yourself a
pissed-off librarian

Tommy ignores the joke Pulls a handful of photos from his
pocket slides them across the table

ANGLE on the pictures Black-and-white surveillance shots of
Lily Davers taken at long range And in each picture a set

of red CROSSHAIRS have been drawn around Lily’s head

TOMMY
I found those last ones here
Inside my house Which means he’s
already got a man on the inside

We realize Tommy isn’t just shaken He’s actually scared
TOMMY
(quietly)
I can’t lose her Paul

Harrigan stares at the photos Makes his decision

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Harrigan opens the door and ushers his three junior
in The men glance around apprehensively

HARRIGAN
Agents Phelps Creery and Wilson
You are hereby being reassigned
You will remain onsite as a
security detail to be used at Mr
Anders’ discretion

The agents gape Conrad in particular looks stunned

TOMMY
I already have security--

HARRIGAN
Youve got dopes playing dress-up
with their daddy’s guns These men
are Bureau trained and field-
certified You wanna keep this girl
safe You need professionals

Tommy sees the wisdom in this Nods slightly

TOMMY
Thank you

HARRIGAN
I’m not doing this for you

TOMMY
All the same

Harrigan turns to leave Conrad grabs his arm--

CONRAD
Sir My wife

HARRIGAN
Sooner you stop this guy the
sooner you come home

agents

INT MANSION ENTRANCE - SECONDS LATER

Harrigan lumbers down the stairs But just as he reaches the
foyer a voice calls out to him

LILY (0S)
Agent Harrigan

Lily emerges from the parlor Smiles shyly

LILY
Tommy talks about you

HARRIGAN
That right

LILY
He’s not what you think He’s a
good man

(hesitates)
I know it’s not my place I know
that But he could really use a
friend right now

HARRIGAN
Well then Good thing he’s got you
(tips his hat)
Miss Davers

Lily watches as Harrigan lets himself out

EXT NEW YORK CITY - MORNING

Dawn breaks over New York Sun glinting through skyscrapers

INT FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY

The field office is a beehive of activity Fedora-clad AGENTS
chattering into telephones pinning photographs onto cork
boards chain-smoking hundreds of cigarettes

Harrigan makes his way to his desk Other agents pass him
without acknowledgement Whispers dog his footsteps The
Bureau’s very own pariah

He reaches his desk sinks into his chair with a sigh--

That’s when he spots his present It’s a clipping of the
front page of the Times showing the now-infamous photo of
Harrigan playing chess with Tommy The picture has been
framed the words FRIENDS FOREVER drawn in blue marker

He clutches the frame tightly willing himself not to
explode Dozens of eyes watching from all around the office
Everyone waiting to see how he’ll react

He exhales Drops the photo into his trash can

Moving with a slow weary dignity he opens his case files
and settles down to work

INT BAR - NIGHT

The tavern is packed with rowdy drunks Harrigan sits alone
at the bar nursing a drink He motions to the bartender

HARRIGAN
Club soda

The bartender keeps working Pretends he didn’t hear

A couple of burly guys playing pool keep casting dark glances
in Harrigan’s direction Muttering to each other We
distinctly catch the word “Traitor”

Harrigan gazes down at the counter Knowing everyone in the
bar is staring Knowing how much they all hate his guts

EXT PARK SLOPE - NIGHT

An upscale residential neighborhood Harrigan knocks on the
door of an elegant three-story home Laughter and music
echoing faintly from inside Some sort of party

At least Harrigan has made an effort tonight he’s wearing
his best suit and tie his stubble recently shaved

His ex-wife ELLEN answers the door Just as beautiful as
ever damn it She blinks a little surprised

ELLEN
Paul

HARRIGAN
How you been

She allows an awkward hug turning her head slightly just so
he doesn’t get any bright ideas

ELLEN
Good good We didn’t know you were
coming You were supposed to mail
the card back

HARRIGAN
Sorry right Must’ve forgot--

DALE (0S)
Is that Paul

DALE Ellen’s new husband appears at her side Handsome
confident He pumps Harrigan’s hand energetically

DALE
Paul Good to see you

HARRIGAN
Hey there Dale

DALE
Come on in

INT ELLEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Dale ushers him inside A few dozen adults and college kids
milling about in formal wear sipping champagne and laughing
A banner on the wall reads CONGRATS CATHY

DALE
So How are things

HARRIGAN
Oh you know Keeping busy--

DALE
(interrupting)
Cathy Look who’s here

CATHY (early 20s radiant) turns away from her conversation

CATHY
Dad

HARRIGAN
Hey kiddo Congratulations

He shambles over and envelops her in a hug Over his
shoulder Cathy locks eyes with her mother “Whats he doing
here” Ellen shrugs helplessly
Harrigan draws away beaming oblivious to her discomfort
HARRIGAN
Look at you Oh almost forgot I
got you something--

He takes a battered envelope from his pocket--

HARRIGAN
It’s not much butyeah

CATHY
Oh You didn’t have to

Dale swoops in plucks the envelope from Harrigan’s hand

DALE
Well just put that with the
others Get you a drink Paul

Harrigan hesitates Sees Ellen watching him closely

HARRIGAN
Nah Taking a little break
(turning back to Cathy)
So Let’s see this rock

He examines her engagement ring whistles softly

HARRIGAN
Aint that something

MARTIN (0S)
I know it’s obscene

They’re joined by MARTIN 24 well-groomed Kind of a smug
little shit to be honest He slings an arm around Cathy

MARTIN
I told her one of these days
youre gonna lose that finger

CATHY
Martin This is my father

A subtle change in Martin’s expression Some of the
friendliness bleeding away He shakes Harrigan’s hand

MARTIN
Cathy’s told me all about you Are
you staying for dinner

HARRIGAN
I don’t wanna impose or nothing--

MARTIN
We won’t take no for an answer

Harrigan glances to Cathy for permission She forces a smile

INT ELLEN’S DINING ROOM - LATER

Cathy and Martin at one end of the dinner table Harrigan has
conspicuously been exiled to the far end stuck among distant
relatives and Martin’s friends from college

Harrigan picks at his meal He doesn’t recognize anything on
his plate Snippets of conversation whizzing over him

COLLEGE KID 1 COLLEGE KID 2
--look at Britain’s economy --don’t see why we don’t just
I’m saying there’s a reason send in the military--

were still in this recession
and they’re not--

COLLEGE KID 3 COLLEGE KID 1
--has nothing to do with --18 unemployment Eighteen
economics It’s about doing You look at Europe they’re
the right thing-- nowhere close to that--

Happy laughter from the far end of the table Cathy is
regaling the guests with a story but we can’t make out the
words Harrigan strains to hear--

Suddenly the COLLEGE KID seated across from him speaks up

COLLEGE KID 2
You’re him right Paul Harrigan

Harrigan nods warily The College Kid leans forward excited

COLLEGE KID 2
What’s it like Chicago

The other conversations fade away Everyone listening now

HARRIGAN
Come on we’re having a party--

MARTIN
I think we’d all like to hear this

Cathy touches her fiancee’s arm but Martin shakes her off

MARTIN
I mean it must be something to
see right All those empty houses
Criminals running wild

CATHY
Martin stop--

HARRIGAN
I did what I was told

MARTIN
So did the guards at Dachau

Harrigan struggles to keep his temper in check

HARRIGAN
Lemme ask you something You being
such an intellectual-type and all
Someone comes to you and says
here’s a city three million
people And over here in your
other hand you got the rest of the
world Three billion people And
they tell you now choose

MARTIN
I’1l1 tell you what I don’t do And
that’s send a civil servant to make
the call

Condescending chuckles from some of Martin’s friends

HARRIGAN
That ain’t what I asked

MARTIN
No what you asked is for me to
weigh the tangible against the
hypothetical Because that’s the
real comparison here Three million
people versus somesome fantasy
doomsday scenario You traded
American lives to win someone
else’s war

HARRIGAN
That’s one way of looking at it

MARTIN
And what’s the other

HARRIGAN
That I’m the only reason you’re not
over there getting your ass shot
off right now

MARTIN
At least I could have fought back

Deafening silence The other guests shift uncomfortably in
their chairs Too late Harrigan realizes the truth

HARRIGAN
Youre from Chicago

MARTIN
My grandparents Oh and you’1ll
like this The staff at their
nursing home One day they decided
to just lock the doors and leave
Left all those people behind No
food no electricity So you tell
me How long do you think they held
out in there After the riots
started I figure maybe a week
Maybe less

All eyes on Harrigan But for once he’s at a loss for words

MARTIN
Your “world war” That’s the
hypothetical Walter and Barbara
Anne Foley 42 years of marriage
four children 13 grandkids between
them That’s the tangible

EXT PARK SLOPE - MOMENTS LATER

Harrigan storms out of the house furious and ashamed
tugging on his jacket as he goes Ellen follows him out

ELLEN
Paul

HARRIGAN
What

He stares at her defiant chest heaving Ellen says nothing

Harrigan tries to flag down a passing cab but it speeds
right past After a moment Ellen joins him on the sidewalk

ELLEN
Dale’s offered to pay for the
wedding

HARRIGAN

What you think I can’t afford it
She doesn’t answer Doesn’t need to

HARRIGAN
Guessing there’s a catch

ELLEN

(hesitates)
It’s justCathy’s been under a

lot of pressure

ELLEN (CONTD)
School the wedding And we just
don’t want anything to ruin the big
day You understand that right

Harrigan looks away Trying to hide how much this hurts
HARRIGAN
(clears his throat)
This guyhe treats her okay
ELLEN
Yeah He does
(beat)
You really give up drinking

HARRIGAN
I mean we’ll see if it sticks

ELLEN
Good for you

He signals another taxi and this one slows to a halt

HARRIGAN
Take lots of pictures for me huh

Ellen doesn’t trust herself to speak simply nods Blinking
back tears as she watches Harrigan climb into the cab
EXT NEW CHICAGO - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOTS of New Chicago’s darkened skyline

INT NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

It’s past midnight but the bar is still packed with Anders’
men Wannabe gangsters and hired muscle blowing off steam
Raucous laughter the air thick with smoke

We recognize Moe Shannon among the crowd He grabs a passing
WAITRESS and pulls her onto his lap

SHANNON
C’mere

WAITRESS
Moe come on I got tables

SHANNON
Youre off the clock Hey

He leans in for a kiss The waitress turns her head slightly
but Shannon roughly grabs her chin jerks her back around

SHANNON
I said come here

She relents it’s not worth the beating But just as
Shannon’s lips meet hers we hear a new sound--

The sharp crackle of GUNFIRE in the distance

The bar falls silent Everyone listening as the shots
continue to ring out It sounds like a war out there

Shannon nods to two of his men The goons exchange reluctant
looks then trudge outside weapons in hand

That’s when the power goes out The entire bar plunged into
sudden darkness

A dozen weapons are drawn in unison

Eyes on the door

Breathless silence

Another staccato blast of GUNFIRE This time closer

One of Shannon’s goons comes stumbling back into sight
Slowly the goon sinks to his knees Topples over

Shannon pushes the waitress aside Stands
CHUNK CHUNK CHUNK Heavy footsteps Just outside

A FIGURE appears in the doorway He’s wearing a long black
duster that trails behind him like a cape

Beneath the duster we glimpse form-fitting leather battle
armor not unlike modern-day SWAT riot gear His face hidden
behind a REFLECTIVE SILVER MASK The mask is featureless
like an unpainted doll save for two darkened eye slits

ERINYES has arrived

The gangsters are too stunned to react Is this a joke

Erinyes surveys the room Then calmly starts forward His
footsteps echoing The crowd parts before him You can
practically hear the Morricone score

Shannon sees one of his goons slowly raising his pistol
Shannon shakes his head quickly Not yet

Erinyes reaches the bar Surveys the bottles on the shelf
like he’s trying to decide on a drink

SHANNON
You lost mister

The masked figure speaks in a low gravelly whisper A voice
that sends chills right down your spine

ERINYES
No

SHANNON
You kill those men out there

Erinyes drums his fingers against the counter His gauntlets
are studded with tiny RAZOR-SHARP BLADES

ERINYES
Just the slow ones

Shannon takes another step closer gun in hand The masked
figure’s back is still turned This is almost too easy

SHANNON
Now why you gotta go and do
something like that huh

ERINYES
I have a message For Tommy

Slowly carefully Shannon raises his pistol--
SHANNON
Yeah How about you tell me I’1l
make sure Tommy gets it

And just like that Erinyes stops drumming his fingers

ERINYES
You are the message

When it happens it happens fast
Erinyes whips around his arm a blur of motion--

Shannon stumbles backward eyes widening a series of small
curved BLADES suddenly quivering in his neck--

Now the other gangsters open fire creating a STROBE EFFECT
flashes of light and shadow--

We catch only glimpses of the action SPEED-RAMPING in and
out of slow-motion for emphasis--

--Erinyes catches the nearest gangster with a clothesline
sweep bending the man’s spine nearly backwards--

--SHHHINNK A quick snap of the wrist and TWO RETRACTABLE
STEEL BLADES erupt from Erinyes’ gauntlets He spins ina
tight circle the blades cutting a swath of devastation--

--Two gangsters open fire from opposite sides of the room but
only manage to hit each other--

--Heavy footsteps from the rafters above Erinyes has taken
to the air leaping from one beam to the next One of the
gangsters opens fire spraying bullets skyward--

--Just as a wire noose slips around his neck launching him
upwards into the darkness

The waitress cowers behind the bar hands clapped over her
ears A few more cries of pain ring out Scattered gunfire

Then only silence

Finally the waitress stands Surveys the ruined bar Bodies
strewn everywhere All of them Anders’ men

WAITRESS
Oh my God

A SHADOW drops soundlessly into frame behind her landing in
a smooth crouch on the bar

The waitress senses the movement Slowly turns Erinyes is
little more than a silver mask floating against the darkness

ERINYES
Tell Tommy Anders Chicago doesn’t
belong to him

The waitress can only watch as Erinyes seems to melt
backwards into the shadows

ERINYES (0S)
Tell him Erinyes is coming

EXT NEW YORK STREETS - MORNING

A transit bus rumbles down the street Harrigan sits in the
back watching as the city blurs past

Welcome to an America that never quite escaped the Great
Depression Poverty runs rampant Failing businesses on every
corner Soup kitchen lines stretching around the block A
businessman in a shabby suit begging for change

Harrigan takes it all in Perhaps wondering just how much of
this mess is his fault

INT FBI FIELD OFFICE - MORNING

Harrigan enters the field office looking rundown

The mood is decidedly somber Agents gathered around a radio
in the corner listening to a news report

HARRIGAN
What’s going on

Freak in the costume Hit another

That’s what the third one

Guy’s got a hobby--

FBI AGENT 3
Shut up I wanna hear this

NORRIS (0S)
Harrigan

Harrigan turns to find NORRIS his supervisor standing in
the doorway Norris jerks his head Get your ass in here
INT NORRIS’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE on a series of photographs

--Tommys tavern Wrecked furniture everywhere The bodies of
Moe Shannon and several others hidden under blankets

--A firebombed supply truck still burning

--A black sedan riddled with bullets two corpses slumped in
the front seat

Harrigan flips through the stack his expression sour

NORRIS
This guy’s not stopping

HARRIGAN
Looks that way
NORRIS
You hear the latest They got
people marching in the streets now
They’re actually supporting this
whackjob you believe that

HARRIGAN
Bet Tommy loves that

NORRIS
Don’t get cute This is your
responsibility You’ve got to I
don’t know calm him down Make
sure he knows we’ve got nothing to
do with this

HARRIGAN
Because that’s the truth Right

The question hangs in the air Norris’s expression

NORRIS
If you’ve got something to say

HARRIGAN
You ever see that news reel the
one where they wheel out Hitler’s
body Got him strapped to that
table looks like he’s sleeping

NORRIS
Of course

HARRIGAN
Well What you didn’t see is the
four hours it took ‘em to sew
Adolf’s head back on

NORRIS
Tommy shot Hitler--

HARRIGAN
Tommy twisted his damn head off
like a bottlecap Course that
don’t make such a good story for
the folks back home So

NORRIS
Your point being

HARRIGAN
Point being we airdropped Tommy
over Berlin and it took him 43
minutes to end the war

darkens

HARRIGAN (CONTD)
With his bare hands

(beat)
So if this mook in the costume is
one of ours If Tommy finds out
Then how long you think the White
House is gonna take him

Norris says nothing His expression unreadable

INT BARRACKS - DINING HALL - NIGHT

The barracks where Tommy’s men reside Goons gathered around
tables drinking and playing cards The air thick with smoke
laughter echoing The gangster version of Neverland

Conrad Creery and Phelps eat alone in the corner They pick
at their food looking miserable and homesick

PHELPS
Where’d he come from that’s what I
wanna know
(jabbing with his fork)
You ask me it’s evolution Like we
replaced the cavemen right Now
Tommy he’s replacing us

CREERY
I heard it’s the government Trying
to make some kinda super soldier

CONRAD
If they could make guys like Tommy
why would they stop at just one

CREERY
What you got a better story

Conrad glances around makes sure no one is eavesdropping

CONRAD
Guy named Deke Anders Small-timer
working for Capone but he’s pretty
far down the ladder right So
here’s Deke he’s out in the
boonies Nebraska some place like
that Got about twenty cases of
Canadian whiskey in the back of his
truck so he’s taking gravel the
whole way nice and slow And all
of the sudden the sky lights up
and he hears this whistling noise
like a bomb coming down

Creery and Phelps trade skeptical looks

CONRAD
And when this thing hits boom
takes out half the cornfield
leaves a crater the size of a
school bus And remember this is
the middle of nowhere There’s a
farmhouse not too far away but the
old couple that lives there they
take one look at Deke and head the
other way So now it’s just Deke
and this hole in the ground

CREERY
You’re so full of shit

CONRAD

(ignoring him)
Except this thing whatever it was
it can’t handle our atmosphere
It’s already breaking apart
Crumbling By the time he gets
there all that’s left is this big
pile of dust But Deke starts
poking around anyway And at the
bottom of this crater he finds
something A glass tube And inside
there’s a baby Fast asleep

Conrad shrugs takes another bite The other two just stare
CONRAD
And that’s how Tommy wound up in
Chicago
INT HARRIGAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A cramped dingy apartment Dirty dishes piled high

We drift past a black-and-white television A Western is
playing The lone gunman facing down a band of outlaws

Harrigan is hunched over his workbench paintbrush in hand
Detailing a piece of MINIATURE FURNITURE

We reveal an elaborate DOLLHOUSE arranged before him

A spot of glue added to a broken bannister railing

A thin line of paint trailed along the cornice molding

Harrigan’s movements are surprisingly delicate Adding daubs
of color here and there bringing the rooms alive

Suddenly the telephone TRILLS spoiling the moment Harrigan
closes his eyes exhales

Like he already knows bad news is coming

EXT NEW CHICAGO - MORNING

Harrigan’s car is waved through the barricade Enters the
streets of New Chicago

A change has come over the city We see far too many armed
gunmen patrolling the streets But precious few civilians

Like everyone has gone into hiding

Harrigan passes a pair of sanitation workers trying to clean
graffiti off a wall A scarlet slogan splashed across the
side of the building in letters three feet high--

ERINYES IS COMING

INT MANSION ENTRANCE - DAY

Tommy’s mansion is on high alert Harrigan is frisked by
several armed guards all of them jumpy and wild-eyed

Through the parlor doors we glimpse Lily Davers in the next
room She looks pale shaken She briefly makes eye contact
with Harrigan Tries to smile Can’t

Conrad and Phelps are standing watch outside the parlor
Their expressions sheepish humiliated

HARRIGAN
And where the hell were you

CONRAD
(mumbling)
--shifts

HARRIGAN
What’s that

CONRAD
Tommy had us working shifts Last
night it was Creery’s turn

HARRIGAN
Yeah Sure sounds that way

Shaking his head in disgust Harrigan brushes past them

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Tommy is seated before the baby grand piano in the corner
His fingers gliding effortlessly over the keys The melody
swoops and dives like a bird of prey aggressive yet
controlled beauty in discordance

The window behind Tommy’s desk has been SHATTERED Shards of
glass everywhere Chunks of plaster missing from the wall

Harrigan surveys the damage taking care to step over
TWO UGLY BROWN BLOODSTAINS on the carpet

HARRIGAN
Christ

Tommy falls still The last notes lingering in the air

HARRIGAN
Didn’t know you played

TOMMY
Picked it up a few days ago It’s
actually a good control exercise
Force comes easy Restraint takes
practice

To demonstrate he applies the tiniest bit of pressure with
his pinky From somewhere deep inside the piano’s guts a
string TWANGS violently The key cracks in half

Harrigan looks stunned It’s one thing hearing about Tommy’s
strength It’s something else seeing it in person

TOMMY
(very quiet)
He almost got her

HARRIGAN
But he didn’t

Tommy stands moves to the shattered window A pause
TOMMY
If I asked you to take Lily

Somewhere far away Would you

HARRIGAN
Depends You going with her

TOMMY
I’m the reason she’s walking around
with a target on her back So you
tell me where am I supposed to go
Where she won’t be in constant
danger Everyone knows who I am

Harrigan stares him down Tommy deflates sinks into a chair

TOMMY
You didn’t answer my question

HARRIGAN
Yeah We could take her

TOMMY
But you’re not going to

Slowly Harrigan shakes his head Tommy smiles bitterly
TOMMY
You know it’s crazy but for a
minute there I almost thought we
were friends

Harrigan wasn’t expecting that Takes him a beat to recover

HARRIGAN

This girl You really love her
TOMMY

Yes
HARRIGAN

Then you know why I gotta say no
Every government out there every
two-bit player they would kill to
get their hands on someone like
her You’re a gun Tommy Biggest
gun in the world And whoever’s got
that girl has his finger on the
trigger

Tommy meets his gaze No hope in those eyes
TOMMY
Just tell me what to do
EXT MANSION GROUNDS - LATER

Harrigan exits the mansion Opens his car door Glances back

And there they are silhouetted in the second-floor window
Tommy and Lily She moves to him He wraps his arms around
her Holding her close

BUREAU ADMINISTRATOR 1 (0S)
100 percent out of the question

INT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BUILDING - DAY

The headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation
Harrigan is seated across from Norris along with two high-
ranking BUREAU ADMINISTRATORS

BUREAU ADMINISTRATOR 1
Hell someone wants to take a swing
at Tommy Anders I say let him

HARRIGAN

I’m telling you Tommy he wants
out We smuggle ‘em out of the
city new names some white picket
fence in the middle of nowhere

(turning to his boss)
You want Chicago back This is how
we do it

Norris sighs Not quite meeting Harrigan’s gaze
NORRIS
There won’t be any deals Paul I’m

sorry Not with your history

HARRIGAN
My history History of what

The men don’t respond Because Harrigan already knows the
answer He’s been officially branded a collaborator

INT BARRACKS - CONRAD’S QUARTERS - LATE NIGHT

The barracks have fallen silent Lights turned down low
Conrad kneels beside his footlocker organizing his gear

Behind him a SHADOW appears on the ledge just outside his
window Ever so slowly the window eases open--

We TRACK with Conrad as he continues unpacking When we
finally PAN BACK the shadowy figure has vanished

But the window is still open

Conrad notices the slight breeze Whirls around--

AND COMES FACE TO FACE WITH ERINYES Light glinting off his
silver mask A silenced pistol in his hand

EXT BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

Just outside Conrad’s room Light FLASHES through the window

accompanied by the sound of two SILENCED PISTOL SHOTS

INT BARRACKS - CONRADS QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER
A gloved hand trails a thin copper wire across the room

A pair of black leather boots casually steps over the corpse
sprawled across the floor

Moving with exacting care Erinyes connects the wire to
several fat bricks of PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES

EXT MANSION GROUNDS - LATE NIGHT

Midnight A swollen moon hangs low over Tommy’s mansion
Scattered guards patrolling the perimeter

Erinyes vaults over the fence landing in the shadows

He draws a pair of SILENCED PISTOLS from his belt Checks his
watch Waitingwaitingwaiting

WHOOOM A massive FIREBALL rises in the distance A split-
second later the THUNDERCLAP ROAR reaches our ears

There goes the barracks

Still Erinyes waits watching the guards scramble about in
confusion--

There Tommy emerges from the mansion tugging on his
clothes He takes one look at the fire raging in the distance
and springs into action racing across the lawn

And HURLING HIMSELF INTO THE NIGHT SKY A leap so powerful it
carries Tommy out of sight in a single bound

Now Time to move

Erinyes darts forward moving in a low crouch approaching
the mansion from an angle

He finds a window cracked ever so slightly Raises it the
rest of the way Slips inside

INT MANSION - CONTINUOUS
We TRACK AFTER Erinyes as he glides through the mansion

THWIP THWIP Two bullets in the chest of the first guard
Erinyes moves quickly catching the body before it can fall
easing it to the ground

HEAVY FOOTSTEPS echo from the stairwell Erinyes slips around
the corner pressing flat against the wall as several of
Tommy’s armed guards hurry past

GUARD 1
Call Fire Team send everyone to
the barracks--

Once they’re safely past Erinyes bolts from cover quickly
ascending the stairs--

Two more guards appear Erinyes doesn’t even slow down as he
raises his twin pistols THWIP THWIP

He pivots smoothly around the next corner--

Vic Francis is standing watch outside Tommy’s bedroom He
sees the advancing figure and fumbles for his gun--

FRANCIS
Wait--

Erinyes drives his gauntlet into Francis’s gut SHHHINNK One
of the retractable blades punches through the back of
Francis’s jacket skewering him like a pig on a spit--

INT TOMMY’S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Lily stands at the window gazing at the inferno in the
distance Plumes of oily smoke etched against the night sky

Her cheeks are wet eyes red and bleary She’s been crying
about something An argument with Tommy perhaps

THUD Something heavy topples to the ground just outside the
bedroom door She turns as the door CREAKS open--

Erinyes stands silhouetted in the doorway Both his pistols
pointing right at her

INT HARRIGAN’S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

Harrigan has fallen asleep on the couch in his clothes Empty
beer bottles strewn across the table

The phone blasts him awake Harrigan fumbles for the
receiver scattering a few bottles in the process

HARRIGAN
(into the phone)
Yeah Harrigan

He listens for a few seconds And his expression changes

INT ELLEN’S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

The sun has barely crested the horizon But that isn’t
stopping someone from ringing the DOORBELL repeatedly

Cathy--Harrigan’s daughter--emerges from her room still half-
asleep Starts down the stairs Sees her mother standing at
the front door arguing in hushed tones with Harrigan

CATHY
Dad

Harrigan peers over Ellen’s shoulder His face lights up

HARRIGAN
Hey kiddo

He’s carrying the bulky DOLLHOUSE He senses the absurdity of
the situation gives her an apologetic smile

ELLEN
We talked about this--

HARRIGAN
One minute That’s all

Ellen sighs lets him inside Cathy joins them in the foyer

CATHY
What are you doing here

HARRIGAN
Well Turns out I’m gonna have to
go away for a while And I know the
wedding’s coming up but--

CATHY
Is that a dollhouse

HARRIGAN
I uh didn’t know what to get you
But I was going past this antique
shop right and saw this in the
window Guess it reminded me of the
one you used to have You remember
that old thing

Cathy bites her lip Nods
Harrigan hurries on The words catching in his throat

HARRIGAN
Yeah It was kinda beat to hell so
I had to give it you know a
little touch-up But I figured
someday when you’ve got kids a
girl of your own maybe she’d like
to have something like this And
you and her maybe you could play
with it together

He sets the dollhouse down on the table Carefully opens the
side revealing the miniature furniture inside It’s
immaculate Everything freshly painted and detailed

HARRIGAN
Got a little mirror and everything

It takes Cathy a second to find her voice

CATHY
It’sit’s great Thanks Dad

He puts his arms around her Cathy stiffens at first then
gives in Buries her face against his shoulder And now we
see just how hard Harrigan is struggling to hold it together

HARRIGAN
Sure wish I could be there when
you walk down that aisle kiddo
You’re gonna knock ‘em dead

ELLEN
Paul is everything okay

HARRIGAN
Everything’s fine Everything’s
just fine

EXT AIRFIELD - AFTERNOON - MONTAGE

Harrigan steps off the charter jet Finds a government sedan
already waiting for him on the tarmac

EXT BLOCKADE - LATE AFTERNOON - MONTAGE

Harrigan’s sedan idles outside the entrance to New Chicago
The barriers have been erected the city is on full lockdown

A panicked GUARD waves his rifle in Harrigan’s face

GUARD
No one in or out Tommy’s orders

HARRIGAN
Get that gun outta my face or I’1l
stick it up your ass

Another thug recognizes Harrigan and pulls the guard away
Whispers a few words in his ear The guard nods gestures

With a rumble the barriers begin to retract

EXT BARRACKS - MONTAGE

Harrigan stands outside the charred skeleton of what used to
be the troop barracks A few beams still smoldering Bodies
in dirty white sheets being carted out of the rubble

A flicker of emotion crosses Harrigan’s face Knowing some of
those bodies belong to the agents he left behind

EXT MANSION - DUSK - MONTAGE

Harrigan parks the sedan Trudges toward the mansion

Long shadows trail him The sun dipping low bathing the sky
in hues of deep purple Night will be here soon

INT MANSION - MONTAGE

Oppressive silence Guards wandering in a daze A few bodies
arranged in the far corner covered by blankets

Harrigan steps into the parlor

The shades have been drawn the lights extinguished Tommy
sits alone in the shadows his head bowed

Slowly Tommy raises his gaze There’s a hollow look in his
eyes Like his guts were just ripped out
And lurking beneath the surface cold unstoppable fury

Someone’s going to die tonight

EXT SHIPPING YARDS - LATE NIGHT

The waterfront shipping docks long since abandoned Lake
Michigan a flat expanse of darkness on the horizon

Harrigan parks his sedan No other vehicles in sight

INT SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

Harrigan takes out his sidearm checks the magazine

EXT SHIPPING YARDS - CONTINUOUS

Harrigan starts across the loading dock Footsteps echoing in
the stillness A gull cries in the distance The rhythmic
lull and crash of waves lapping against the pier

Ahead of him an old warehouse looms out of the darkness

INT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Harrigan hauls open the warehouse door and slips inside

Shipping containers tower above him Rats scuttle in the
gloom Watery moonlight trickling through dirty windows

And there at the far end of the warehouseLILY Bound to a
chair We can’t tell whether she’s still alive

Harrigan remains motionless Scanning the shadows

HARRIGAN
I know you’re here

A swoop A rustle in the darkness A flicker of motion
And Erinyes materializes out of the night
HARRIGAN
Lose the mask

(No response )
I said take it off

Instead Erinyes slowly cocks his head to one side Breathing
heavily from behind that mask Like he’s excited

And now we start to realize that something is deeply
dangerously wrong with this guy

Harrigan gives up Throws his hands up in disgust
HARRIGAN
We had him Do you not get that
Tommy wanted out
Erinyes circles him His voice a low rasp
ERINYES
He doesn’t get to walk away Not

after what he’s done

HARRIGAN
Youre out of your mind--

The words die in Harrigan’s throat
Because he just noticed the object in the corner

A heavy canvas tarp hides the object from sight Whatever it
is it’s big At least the size of a heavy-duty fridge

Harrigan approaches and draws the tarp aside--

We don’t see what’s underneath But we see the blood drain
from Harrigan’s face A look of sick horror

HARRIGAN
(whispering)
What have you done
While his back is turned Erinyes draws his pistol--

Harrigan whirls around his voice rising to a shout--

HARRIGAN
Goddamn it we had a plan

ERINYES
This was always the plan

Erinyes fires A single shot burying itself deep in
Harrigan’s gut Harrigan staggers Collapses

The masked figure kneels beside him Speaking softly

ERINYES
For what it’s worth I’m sorry

Harrigan coughs Blood foaming at the corners of his mouth

HARRIGAN
Tommy’s gonna kill you

ERINYES
He’s gonna try

Erinyes stands Fires two more bullets into Harrigan Then
turns and strides away

And we SMASH CUT TO BLACK

CHAPTER TWO THE HERO

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

FRANK “THE ENFORCER” NITTI storms down the hallway Al
Capone’s second-in-command A cold imposing man

FX CHICAGO 1918

A pair of nervous-looking ARMED BODYGUARDS stand watch
outside the apartment One of them nods to Frank

BODYGUARD
Mr Nitti

FRANK NITTI
Open up

INT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Frank enters the apartment alone Ornate decor a staggering
backdrop of the city’s lights far below Deathly silent

FRANK NITTI
Tommy It’s Uncle Frank

He opens the bedroom door revealing a room filled with every
sort of toy you can imagine Model train sets mobiles
plastic pop-guns a cowboy hat hanging from a peg

YOUNG TOMMY is huddled in the corner knees drawn to his
chest his cheeks slick with tears No more than eight years
old He’s clutching a PLASTIC TOY DINOSAUR

FRANK NITTI
Tommy hey I came as soon as I
heard

No response Frank lowers himself to a kneeling position

FRANK NITTI
How you doing buddy

YOUNG TOMMY
I didn’t mean to

FRANK NITTI
Yeah we know that

Tommy’s voice hitches in his throat A low miserable sob

YOUNG TOMMY
She was yelling I just wanted to
make her stop

FRANK NITTI
Course you did Course you did

Frank casts a sidelong glance across the room

Tommys NANNY lies crumpled against the wall eyes open but
unseeing neck wrenched sideways at a horrible angle

Frank returns his attention to the boy And without warning
his voice becomes cold unforgiving

FRANK NITTI
Now stop that pissant cryin’

And Tommy does He stares up at Frank shocked into silence

FRANK NITTI

(quietly)
You wanna know why God made some
people weak He put ‘em here for
us Because we’re the ones who move
the wheel The weak they exist
because we allow them this
privilege And privileges can be
revoked

Tommy listens raptly Absorbing every word
FRANK NITTI

You’re gonna move a lot of wheels
Tommy boy

FRANK NITTI (CONTD)

And if you accept this

responsibility this gift you’ve

been given then you don’t ever

have to apologize for what you are
EXT BANK — DAY
TOMMY 24 years old and already impossibly handsome stands
on a street corner facing the First National Bank of Chicago
Takes a deep breath Starts across the street

INT BANK - MOMENTS LATER

The bank is bustling with activity Tellers counting money
An elderly SECURITY GUARD standing watch in the corner

A wealthy couple is next in line Their young son fidgeting
beside them bored out of his mind The boy is the first to
notice when Tommy walks through the front door

A frightened silence descends Whispered murmurs

Tommy calmly surveys the scene Starts forward

The guard draws his gun plants himself in Tommy’s path

SECURITY GUARD
Just walk away mister

Tommy doesn’t even acknowledge the guard as he strides past
The guard helplessly lowers his sidearm ashamed--

The mother grabs her son drags him out of Tommy’s path--

Tommy slips behind the counter Approaches the vault’s
MASSIVE IRON DOOR All the bank tellers fall back

Tommy pauses before the door Glances around

TOMMY
Someone gonna open this

No one is brave enough to step forward Tommy shrugs

Then he clutches the door and TEARS IT FREE FROM THE WALL
The damn thing must weigh 500 pounds but Tommy doesn’t even
break a sweat He hurls the door over his shoulder with
casual disregard--

A bracing CRUNCH as the door lands somewhere offscreen
Several people SCREAM Tommy ignores them

He enters the vault Piles of gold bars stacked high on
rolling carts He methodically begins loading the gold into a
duffel bag Taking his time gathering every last bar

EXT BANK - MOMENTS LATER

Tommy emerges from the bank duffel bags slung over his
shoulder His expression is troubled conflicted Almost like
he’s having second thoughts about this entire affair

Suddenly he stops short We pan around him--

Revealing at least a HUNDRED POLICE OFFICERS on the street
outside A hundred guns pointed right at his forehead

Here at least is a problem that Tommy knows how to solve

TOMMY
Hello boys

INT PRISON VISITING AREA - DAY

Now we skip ahead several years into the future The visiting
area of a maximum-security prison Adjacent viewing rooms
separated by a thick glass barrier

The guards escort a PRISONER through the door A heavyset man
in an orange jumpsuit paunchy and balding He takes a seat

On the other side of the barrier waits TOMMY A few years
older than when we last saw him and a few million dollars
richer At least judging from that suit he’s wearing

PRISONER
Tommy boy Starting to think you
forgot all about me

TOMMY
Mr Capone

And now we recognize the prisoner AL CAPONE himself He
glances over Tommy’s shoulder nods curtly

AL CAPONE PRISONER
Not to tell you your business or
nothing but you might wanna take
care of them screws first

We PAN OVER Tommy to reveal that at least 20 PRISON GUARDS
are gathered behind Tommy pointing their rifles at the back
of his head Most of them look scared out of their minds

TOMMY
I’m not here to “bust you out”
This is a professional courtesy

Capone’s smile falters

AL CAPONE
The hell you talking about

TOMMY
You should stay where you are

AL CAPONE
Stay where Tommy Come on quit
playing get me outta here

TOMMY
You’re not listening There’s
nothing for you out there Not
anymore

AL CAPONE
You unbelievable shit Where’s
Frank Does he know you’re here

TOMMY
Frank’s dead

Capone blinks He leans forward voice dropping a register

AL CAPONE
You think just ‘cuz I’m stuck in
here I can’t get to you Huh

TOMMY
Threats from a fat man in orange
pajamas You don’t scare me Mr
Capone You wouldn’t even know
where to begin

Tommy turns away without another word Capone calls after
him banging his fist against the glass--

AL CAPONE
Tommy TOMMY

SMASH CUT TO
CLOSE on Tommy’s face His eyes are closed In the
background we hear soldiers SCREAMING in German The rattle

and thump of heavy weaponry explosions in the distance

A symphony of death

The memories are CUT OFF ABRUPTLY as Tommy opens his eyes--

EXT STREETS OF WASHINGTON - DAY

Tommy is seated in the back of an open town car following a
parade down Pennsylvania Avenue Hundreds of screaming
spectators line the parade route

Tommy waves to his fans He’s clad in a starched blue Army
dress uniform Flanked by a military honor guard

Everywhere he looks people are cheering his name
He’s a hero The man who killed Adolf Hitler

FX WASHINGTON DC 1940

EXT WHITE HOUSE LAWN - SHORT TIME LATER

Flashbulbs explode like artillery shells Crowds of adoring
fans Signs and banners held aloft

Harrigan stands on the erected dais in the center of the
lawn surrounded by military brass Looking uncomfortable as
the flashbulbs continue to erupt from the crowd below

Tommy clasps the hand of PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT The President
shakes it energetically smiling the whole time

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
You did a hell of a thing for your
country son

TOMMY
It’s not my country anymore Sir

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT
Just smile for the damn camera

FLASH Several BLACK-AND-WHITE PHOTOS of Tommy with the
Presidentreceiving a commendationwaving to the crowd

The final photo shows Tommy shaking Harrigan’s hand

EXT WHITE HOUSE LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

The ceremony has just ended Tommy descends the dais heading
straight for the crowd of reporters The flashbulbs are
blinding A dozen questions shouted all at once--

Behind him Harrigan and Norris watch uneasily

NORRIS
What’s he doing

HARRIGAN
I don’t know

Tommy reaches the reporters Holds up his hands for silence

TOMMY
I have a message For the
scientists The philosophers The
true artists of the world
(beat)
New Chicago is waiting for you

Back on the dais Norris doesn’t like what he’s hearing

NORRIS
Cut him off

HARRIGAN
I don’t think I--

NORRIS
Just do it

Back to Tommy Speaking directly to the reporters A message
that will be broadcast across the entire globe

TOMMY
There are those who seek to stand
in the way of progress Your
governments Corporations
Churches Because they’re afraid of
us Of what we can accomplish

Harrigan hurries toward the reporters--
TOMMY
That ends now With your help we
can build a safe haven for those
who dare to dream of a better
world All that’s missing is you

His message delivered Tommy turns away ignoring the barrage
of questions
EXT CHICAGO OUTSKIRTS - DAY

Chaos The clamor of car horns Hundreds of automobiles
hopelessly gridlocked in an attempt to escape the city

Chicago is emptying out Its residents fleeing en masse

EXT CHICAGO STREETS - DAY

Families piling their belongings into trucks Others have
abandoned their cars altogether and scurry down the sidewalk
on foot

Crashing waves of humanity People jostling and shouting
Tempers boiling over fights erupting in the street

A child sits on an abandoned stoop sobbing inconsolably
A looter heaves a brick through the window of a store

Teenage lovers embrace before the boy is dragged away by his
parents The girl cries out after him

An elderly couple watches from a second story window holding
each other tightly The old man draws the blinds

And still the crowd surges onward

INT JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT

A gloved hand SMASHES a glass display case and begins
scooping necklaces into a bag

Three men are looting a high-end jewelry store We recognize
Vic Francis and John Nelly The third man is FRANCO DONELLI

Outside a fleeing figure dashes past the store In the
distance we hear shouts mingled with the occasional gunshot

Nelly plucks a diamond ring holds it up to the light

NELLY
Hey Vic Guess how much this rock
goes for

DONELLI

You two wanna hurry it up
Donelli stuffs another handful into his bag turns
And finds Tommy standing in the doorway His eyes blazing

DONELLI
Boss Hey

TOMMY
What is this

DONELLI
Christmas shopping Gotta start
early right

Tommy’s expression remains stony Donelli quickly sobers up

DONELLI
We figured you’d want us to get
this stuff Before someone else

TOMMY
People are dying out there
Stabbing each other over a loaf of
bread And you’re shopping

DONELLI
Tommy c’mon it was a joke--

TOMMY
Vic You’re now Head of Security

DONELLI
(tries to smile)
What I’m getting demoted

Without even looking Tommy reaches out and seizes Donelli by

the throat SNAPS HIS NECK
Vic Francis stares in horror as Donelli’s body crumples
TOMMY
(quietly)
Vic Did you hear me

Francis swallows hard Drops his bag of loot straightens up

FRANCIS
I won’t let you down Tommy

Francis and Nelly hurry past leaving Tommy alone in the
ruined store Sirens echoing in the distance
INT PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

A spacious penthouse overlooking the Chicago skyline Tommy
stands before the window Vic hovers in the background

TOMMY
I’ve never seen it so dark

Most of the city appears to be without power No lights
visible from any of the skyscrapers No lights at all

TOMMY
How many did we lose

FRANCIS
Still waiting on the final census
but we’re looking at about a 90
percent loss Give or take

TOMMY
90 percent In one week
(beat)
No one’s coming are they

FRANCIS
You gotta give folks time

TOMMY
We can’t feed them Keep them safe
We can’t even keep the lights on

He stares out across the deserted city Wondering how it all
went so wrong so fast

TOMMY
They never even gave me a chance

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - DAY

Again we skip forward in time Tommy has been running New
Chicago for several years now Watching his city slip away

FX 1945

Harrigan slides his bishop across the battered chessboard
Hesitates before taking his fingers off the piece

Tommy merely raises an eyebrow Daring him
Harrigan sighs returns the bishop to its original position

TOMMY
I didn’t say anything

HARRIGAN
You didn’t have to
(beat)
I ever tell you the guys back at
the office they got a pool going
on you Whether you can fly or not
Up to a hundred bucks

Tommy glares at him This is obviously a well-worn topic

TOMMY
And that’s why I own six cars

HARRIGAN
Hell I dunno maybe you don’t
wanna freak people out

TOMMY
I told you I can’t fly

HARRIGAN
Yeah well no offense but I got
ten bucks in the pot so I’m gonna
tell ‘em you were bouncing off the
walls like Peter Pan

That earns a faint smile Then Tommy grows serious once more

TOMMY
I need a favor Qualen Industries
They’re leaning on the unions
again Blocking supply routes If I
lose those trucks the riots are
going to start all over again

Harrigan moves his knight Instantly Tommy counters his
castle ripping through Harrigan’s left defensive flank

TOMMY
Should have stuck with the bishop

HARRIGAN
This right here This is why people
don’t like you

TOMMY
Qualen Industries holds a number of
defense contracts Ones it can’t
afford to lose The right word in
the right ear

HARRIGAN
And you think what I’m your guy

TOMMY
You are my Bureau liaison I need
those trucks running

HARRIGAN
Yeah Be a real shame if this place
turned into a dump

TOMMY
Do you want to know how I spend my
days The power department won’t
keep the lights on without a
security detail The guards won’t
show up for work unless they have
some place to unwind after The
bars won’t stay open unless they’ve
got supply lines from the outside
And we can’t even contact those
suppliers unless the power
department does its job in the
first place

HARRIGAN
Bureaucracys a hell of thing You
gonna put me in check or what
TOMMY
Harrigan I’m not blind I know
things are bad I know that But

you have to believe me I can fix
this I just need more time

INT TOMMY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tommy lies awake in bed staring up at the ceiling Flanked
by two beautiful women fast asleep on either side

FX 1946

He slides out of bed moves to the window Moonlight glinting
off his perfectly formed body

The Chicago skyline stretches before him rising into the
night like blades Not a single electric light in sight

Only darkness

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Tommy wanders down the deserted corridor Six years of
neglect has reduced this grand old building to a shell of its
former self A carpet of dust underfoot

INT APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Tommy drifts through his former apartment Nothing has been
touched or removed since he lived here as a child

The electric train set The model airplanes dangling from the
ceiling on wires spinning lazily

Something SQUEAKS underfoot His old plastic toy dinosaur
Tommy turns it in his hands Lovingly runs his fingers along
the creature’s stubby plastic teeth

He kneels there in the darkness The single most powerful man
in the entire world

Alone

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - DAY
Tommy sifts through paperwork while arguing into the phone
TOMMY
--isn’t a negotiation Listen then
put a few of them on sanitation
detail see how they like that--
Moe Shannon knocks on the door Grinning like a goon
MOE
Boss ‘Scuse me sorry Theres a
girl asking for you

Moe mimes an impressive pair of breasts raises his eyebrows

TOMMY
Tell her I’m busy

MOE
You sure This girl--

TOMMY
I said no

Moe shrugs turns away And that’s when Tommy catches a
glimpse of the woman waiting in the hallway beyond

LILY DAVERS Her clothes may be shabby and threadbare and
who knows when she had her last real meal but we’d recognize
those eyes anywhere Those unforgettable luminous eyes

TOMMY
Send her in

Tommy hangs up the phone as Moe ushers the woman inside

Tommy looks her up and down with a critical eye Lily
weathers his gaze with an air of quiet dignity

TOMMY
Do we have a name

LILY
Lily sir Lily Davers

TOMMY
And what can I do for you

LILY
Wouldn’t say no to a hot meal

TOMMY
This isn’t a soup kitchen Miss
Davers You want rations you can
join a work detail like everyone
else Can you sew Cook

(She shakes her head)

What about a broom Think you can
figure that out

LILY
If it comes to that

TOMMY
You don’t like it there’s always
recreation Entertaining the men

LILY
I can play piano Mostly classical--

TOMMY
Not that kind of entertaining

Lily’s expression darkens

LILY
I’m no whore

TOMMY
Clearly Whores work for their
money

LILY
And I’m not here for a job
interview

TOMMY
Then why

Her gaze is penetrating a little unnerving Tommy shifts
his seat Not quite able to pin this girl down

LILY
I wanted to see for myself What
folks say about you If it’s true

TOMMY
And what do they say

But she only smiles ruefully Then turns away

LILY
Sorry to waste your time

Tommy stares after her For once he’s at a loss for words
But just as she reaches for the door handle--

TOMMY
Wait

INT RESTAURANT - LATER

Once upon a time this was the classiest restaurant in town
Now it remains in operation for a single customer

A waiter glides over to where Tommy and Lily are seated
refills their wine The other tables remain empty

Lily wolfs down her pasta Tommy watches her attack the meal
charmed He takes a small bite of steak savoring it

LILY
You know some folks they say you
don’t eat

TOMMY
I eat because I enjoy it Not
because I have to

LILY
So you don’t get hungry

TOMMY
No

She studies him her expression pensive

LILY
That’s kinda sad

TOMMY
Sad

LILY
Food tastes better when you’re
hungry How are you supposed to
appreciate something if you don’t
even notice when it’s gone

TOMMY
Says the girl who hasn’t tasted a
single bite of that pasta

LILY
(a sheepish grin)
Yeah well It’s been a while

TOMMY
How long is a while

LILY
Since the beginning

TOMMY
Six years without food rations

LILY
It wasn’t so bad at first Matthew--
that’s my brother--he got pretty
good at finding stuff We even had
hot water there for a bit

TOMMY
And where’s Matthew now

LILY
We heard there was a man selling
milk down on Lasalle The real
stuff not the powdered kind Matty
went to check it out

She shrugs Doesn’t need to finish the sentence

TOMMY
You could have left

LILY
Oh trust me I thought about it
I’m still thinking about it

TOMMY
What stopped you

LILY
(shrugs)
Some things are worth fighting for

On Tommy considering this

EXT WRIGLEY FIELD - LATE NIGHT

Wrigley Field as it stood in the late 1940s The hallowed
stadium has been deserted for years now Trash strewn
everywhere Banners leeched of color by the sun

Despite all that it’s still a magical place Tommy guides
Lily onto the field Grinning at her wide-eyed reaction

TOMMY
My uncle Frank used to bring me
here on weekends Back when they
were still the Staleys

Lily turns in a slow circle An infinite field of stars
glittering high overhead

LILY
You know what I always forget How
in the old days you couldn’t even
see the stars

Tommy watches her Intrigued but still a little wary

TOMMY
When you came to the office You
said you wanted to see for
yourself What people were saying
about me Were they right

Her smile fades She gazes at him for a slow measured beat

LILY
I don’t know yet

TOMMY
What do they say

LILY
That you’re not human

Tommy’s face is a mask Only the slightest flinch betrays
him How much that hurt

TOMMY
But you haven’t made up your mind

LILY
Mmm No
(She starts walking)
LILY (CONTD)
Youre smart Handsome You don’t
seem cruel I like talking to you

TOMMY
But

She stops spreads her arms to the ruined stadium

LILY
But then I look around

TOMMY
Do you want to know why I signed
the Treaty Because I looked around
and saw a world run by sparrows

LILY
Sparrows

TOMMY

They’re not an indigenous species
most people don’t know that An
Englishman in New York released
eight pairs into the wild Before
that they didn’t exist on this
continent

(beat)
But here’s the problem sparrows
are nasty little things They breed
too fast they eat what doesn’t
belong to them they invade other
birds’ nests and murder their
young They consume and they kill
and that’s all they do So the
sparrows came along and wiped out
most of the songbirds But the
songbirds were the only thing
keeping the insect population in
check So now the bugs are running
wild introducing new diseases
ruining entire harvests we’re
talking plagues and famines that
cost thousands of lives All from
eight pairs of sparrows Because an
Englishman thought they were
pretty

LILY
So we’re all just sparrows

TOMMY
No Just the ones in charge
LILY
And you taking over the city is
what Altruism

TOMMY

No it’s me dragging our entire
species kicking and screaming up
the evolutionary ladder

(takes a step closer)
I have an IQ that can’t be measured
because there’s no one smart enough
to write the tests I don’t get
tired and I don’t feel pain and I’m
sick of being the only one who
knows what that’s like So maybe
I’m not human You tell me

Now he’s towering over her But Lily gazes back fearless

LILY
You know what I think I think
people choose to be alone

She leans in closer Until they’re practically touching

LILY
Maybe you should stop looking so
hard for a reason

Lily brushes her lips against his A fleeting kiss but it’s

electric Unlike anything Tommy’s ever experienced
She smiles mischievously as she turns away

LILY
Hell of a first date

We CRANE AWAY from the pair as they cross the field together

Until we reach the stadium’s bleachers high overhead

Where a LONE FIGURE stands silhouetted against the night sky

Without warning the figure wheels away His duster flutters

like a cape Light reflecting off his silver mask

Erinyes has arrived in Chicago

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - DAY - MONTAGE

Tommy guides Lily into his office Her eyes are closed He

steps back with a flourish revealing--

A BABY GRAND PIANO in the corner of the room

Lily takes a seat Tests the keys Glances up at Tommy
suddenly shy He gives an encouraging nod

And Lily begins to play

The MUSIC--which carries through the rest of this montage--is
by turns uplifting and haunting A tapestry of love and loss
INT DARKENED ROOM -— MONTAGE

Erinyes slips a pair of silenced pistols into his belt
Straps studded leather gauntlets over his forearms

Slides that featureless silver mask into place

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - MONTAGE

Tommy takes Lily’s hand guides her to her feet They begin a
slow waltz moving as one She rests her head against his
shoulder He holds her close Breathing her in

EXT STREET CORNER - NIGHT - MONTAGE

Ugly graffiti splashed across a concrete wall

ERINYES IS COMING

EXT LINCOLN PARK - DAY - MONTAGE

The leaves are changing canopies of green giving way to
shades of burnt umber Tommy and Lily walk hand-in-hand
through the empty park talking and laughing

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT - MONTAGE

A pair of goons unloading cases of whiskey from the trunk of
a car A sound catches their attention They turn--

Just as Erinyes steps out of the shadows and OPENS FIRE

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT - MONTAGE

Locked in an embrace Tumbling backwards onto the bed Lily’s
hands tugging at Tommy’s shirt pulling it free Her breath
hot against his neck Back arched in pleasure

INT MANSION - DAY - MONTAGE

Lily is back at the piano But now the melody turns somber
Until it’s practically a dirge

In the next room she can see Tommy conversing with his
lieutenants Hammering the desk pacing like a cat

Erinyes has struck again

Finally Tommy notices Lily He offers her a small absent
smile Then closes the office door

INT TOMMY’S STUDY - MONTAGE

Lily unlocks the door to Tommy’s old study She stops dead in
her tracks eyes widening in wonderment--

The centerpiece of the room is a MASSIVE DIORAMA OF CHICAGO
But this is Chicago as Tommy once imagined it Gleaming white

skyscrapers Monorails zipping through town on elevated
rails Zeppelins hovering overhead A self-sustaining utopia

The walls are covered with blueprints concept art
renderings of the city of the future So much failed promise

But a thick coat of DUST covers every surface of the room No
one has been in here for a very long time
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT - MONTAGE

A shaft of pale moonlight plays across the room Briefly
illuminating Lily’s sleeping form She’s alone in the bed

As the MUSIC FADES we reveal Tommy watching her sleep His
expression deeply troubled He glances down once more at the
object in his hand

A black-and-white SURVEILLANCE PHOTO of Lily The picture was
taken at long-range Lily is laughing and unaware

A set of crimson CROSSHAIRS have been drawn around her head

For the first time in his life Tommy has something to lose

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

Tommy paces frustrated

TOMMY
I already have security--

HARRIGAN
Youve got dopes playing dress-up
with their daddy’s guns These men
are Bureau trained and field-
certified You wanna keep this girl
safe You need professionals

Behind Harrigan stand the three junior agents Conrad Phelps
and Creery Their expressions stunned

And no you’re not crazy we’ve seen this all before This is
the scene from page 14 now shot from Tommy’s perspective

TOMMY
Thank you

HARRIGAN
I’m not doing this for you

TOMMY
All the same

Tommy watches as Conrad stops Harrigan at the door

CONRAD
Sir My wife

HARRIGAN
Sooner you stop this guy the
sooner you come home

Harrigan exits leaving the three junior agents behind
A tense beat as Tommy evaluates the new conscripts
TOMMY
You’1l work in shifts I want
around-the-clock protection on Miss
Davers You will keep her safe or

youll answer to me Are we clear

CONRAD
Yes sir

Tommy brushes past them Heads down the corridor--

He pauses at the balcony railing In the foyer below Agent
Harrigan is talking with Lily

LILY
He’s not what you think He’s a
good man

Tommy watches from above Strangely touched by her faith

LILY
I know it’s not my place I know
that But he could really use a
friend right now

HARRIGAN
Well then Good thing he’s got you
(tips his hat)
Miss Davers

After Harrigan departs Lily turns back Notices Tommy
standing there and offers him a small tired smile

Tommy smiles back Trying to hide how worried he really is

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

ANGLE on a map of New Chicago spread across Tommy’s desk
Tommy’s finger traces a twisting route through the city

TOMMY (0OS)
The supply truck that’s our Judas
goat We bring the convoy up Lake
Shore then send the truck into
this cul-de-sac here There’s no
way out If he’s watching that’s
where he’1l make his move

Vic Francis and John Nelly listen intently bobbing their
heads like circus seals

TOMMY
I want snipers on the roofs here
here and over here--

He’s interrupted by a KNOCK at the door Agent Creery enters
looking apologetic Carrying a paper parcel in his hands

CREERY
Found this out front

TOMMY
You find a strange package and you
just bring it into my home

CREERY
It’s not a bomb or nothing The
guys downstairs made sure

TOMMY
Give it here

Creery places the package on the desk Tommy removes the lid
His brow furrows What the hell

He removes a small rectangular object from inside--
A BATTERED MILITARY-GRADE FIELD RADIO

FRANCIS
Whazzat Some kinda radio

Tommy CLICKS the power button The radio hums to life--

Suddenly we hear a SHARP BRITTLE CRACK Like a twig being
snapped in half Tommy turns in his chair--

Revealing that a SMALL HOLE has just appeared in the bay
window behind him No larger than a quarter

Tommy frowns Glances back--

Just in time to see Agent Creery swaying drunkenly on his
feet A red stain spreading across his chest

Creery is dead before he even hits the floor

NELLY
Shit

Francis and Nelly bolt from their seatsbut they’re
interrupted by a sudden BLAST OF STATIC from the radio

OMINOUS VOICE (0S)
Tell your men They move they die

FRANCIS
Boss

Tommy nods slightly and they sink back into their chairs

OMINOUS VOICE (0S)
That’s better

With exaggerated care Tommy turns back to the window--
TOMMYS POV A figure is crouched atop a highrise building a

few hundred yards away Little more than a speck silhouetted
against the night sky

TOMMY
Erinyes

Now we INTERCUT WITH--

EXT ROOFTOP -— CONTINUOUS

Erinyes peers through the scope of a bolt-action SPRINGFIELD
M1903A4 SNIPER RIFLE An identical field radio at his side

ERINYES
I want you to listen to me very
carefully You’re going to leave
Chicago Tonight And you’re never
coming back

Tommy regards the distant figure for a long thoughtful beat

TOMMY
No

ERINYES
(instantly)
Your call

BOOM John Nelly is lifted out of his chair as another
deafening GUNSHOT rings out Nelly’s body slams lifelessly to
the floor one leg still twitching

Erinyes is already chambering another round His crosshairs
are now centered over Vic’s heart

ERINYES
What do you say Tommy I can do
this all night

TOMMY
I say go ahead

Francis moans miserably

FRANCIS
Aw Jesus

TOMMY
Because the second you pull that
trigger there’s nothing keeping me
in this chair

ERINYES
I’m counting on it

FRANCIS
Tommy Come on it’s me

ERINYES
I want you to remember this That I
gave you the chance to call this
off Because somewhere out there
there’s something you do care
about And I’m gonna find it and
I’m gonna take it from you

And at that moment the exact worst possible moment the
office door opens and Lily steps through

LILY
Tommy I heard someone--

TOMMY
LILY GET DOWN

Lily sees the bodies on the floor and freezes her eyes
widening Tommy starts to rise from his chair--

ERINYES
MOVE AND SHE DIES

He has no choice Tommy reluctantly takes his seat once more

ERINYES
Tell her to be still TELL HER

TOMMY
Juststay where you are
Everything’s gonna be okay

When Erinyes speaks again he sounds almost amused

ERINYES
Well what do you know Told you
Id find something

ERINYES’ POV The CROSSHAIRS of the sniper rifle are now
centered directly over Lily’s heart

ERINYES
So I’1l ask you one more time Pick
a direction and start walking I
don’t care where Because the
alternative the only alternative
is you get to watch this girl die

Tommy meets Lily’s gaze Sees the terror in her eyes

LILY
Tommy

The beat drags out Tommy staring at Lily in helpless
anguish When he speaks again his voice is very quiet

TOMMY
I have a counter offer
(beat)
Ten seconds
ERINYES
Ten seconds
TOMMY
That’s the head start I’m giving
you
ERINYES

Generous I’1l pass

TOMMY
You shouldn’t You know how fast
the average person can run Ten
maybe thirteen miles an hour I can
do twenty-eight

ERINYES
In that case I’m already dead

TOMMY
Not if you were smart enough to
have a car waiting Ten seconds
that’s the difference between you
reaching that car and me reaching
you

Lily watches Tommy with growing despair Realizing this man
will never give in Not even to save her life

ERINYES
Time’s up Tommy What’s it gonna
be

TOMMY

Five seconds

Erinyes says nothing Tommy continues to count down keeping
his gaze fixed on Lily the entire time

TOMMY
Four Three

LILY

Tommy

Erinyes exhales slowly steadying his aim--

TOMMY

Two

(beat)
One

Lily closes her eyes

Now things happen fast

Tommy ERUPTS from his chair pivoting his arm a blur--

Erinyes fires The recoil kicking the rifle against his
shoulder the report echoing like a whipcrack--

And then only silence
Erinyes raises the rifle’s scope to his eye once more--
And finds Tommy standing at the window staring back at him

Slowly Tommy opens his fist The FLATTENED SLUG clatters to
the floor He caught the fucking bullet

ERINYES
(softly)
That’s impossible
EXT MANSION GROUNDS ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

And now the chase is on

Tommy hurls himself through the shattered window Hits the
ground already running His legs a blur

Erinyes drops the sniper rifle races across the rooftop--

Without slowing down Erinyes snaps a steel clip onto a ZIP
LINE CABLE and leaps fearlessly over the side--

At the same time TOMMY LAUNCHES HIMSELF SKYWARD--

The handheld clip SCREAMS against the steel cable leaving a
trail of cascading sparks as Erinyes picks up speed--

CRUNCH Tommy lands on the rooftop like a mortar shell--

Thats when twenty-five pounds of PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES
scattered across the roof DETONATE SIMULTANEOUSLY

The fireball blossoms white-hot against the sky swallowing
Tommy whole--

The zip line cable stretches the length of almost three city
blocks By the time Erinyes reaches the ground he’s
traveling at least twenty miles an hour--

He hits the ground in a smooth combat roll Then he’s on his
feet again sprinting for his life--

A BLAZING SILHOUETTE launches itself from the rooftop
inferno Tommy plummets toward the ground like a meteorite
his clothes burning landing in a graceful crouch--

But Erinyes has already reached a BLACK SEDAN its engine
idling No time for doors he hurls himself onto the roof of
the car just as it takes off--

ERINYES
GO GO

Tommy charges after them a streak of orange fire bounding
over cars his feet barely seeming to touch the ground--

On the roof of the speeding sedan Erinyes glances back--
Tommy is quickly gaining on them--

Erinyes pulls a HANDHELD RADIO DETONATOR from his belt--
Tommy is only seconds away--

The sedan screams past a parked GAS TANKER--

Just as Tommy reaches the tanker Erinyes hits the button--

WHOOOOOM The tanker EXPLODES a brilliant orange fireball
that lifts Tommy off his feet SLAMMING him sideways straight

through the nearest building

The sedan skids around the next corner and disappears from
sight carrying Erinyes with it

Seconds later Tommy claws his way out of the rubble singed
and covered with dust but otherwise unharmed He looks
around chest heaving eyes alight with fury

But the sedan is already gone

EXT MANSION GROUNDS - LATER

The damaged highrise building continues to burn a candle
against the night sky

Tommy trudges up the path leading to the mansion Guards
hurry past on their way to help put out the fire Tommy
ignores them all Only one thing matters

INT MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
Lily

He finds her in the bathroom curled in a ball knees against
her chest trembling all over She won’t even look at him

He takes a seat beside her Gently pulls her onto his lap
Cradling her in his powerful arms

TOMMY
(whispering)
It’s all right It’s all right

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lily lies in bed awake but unresponsive Tommy adjusts the
blanket over her Brushes her hair aside

TOMMY
You know I would never let anything
happen to you
(She says nothing)
I calculated the path of the
bullet From the roof to the
window That’s how I knew

LILY
This time

TOMMY
There won’t be a next time

She doesn’t respond Won’t even turn to face him
TOMMY
Maybemaybe you should leave

town Just until it’s safe

LILY
Come with me

TOMMY
You know I can’t

Tommy waits But she doesn’t speak again

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - DAY - MONTAGE

A reverse shot of the scene from page 31 Tommy at the piano
Harrigan steps over the bloodstains on the carpet

The PIANO MELODY carries through the next several scenes--

EXT CITY STREET - MONTAGE

Harrigan stands on the street surveying the aftermath of
Tommy’s chase with Erinyes The charred husk of the gas
tanker The crumbling fagade of the demolished building

Harrigan shakes his head Jesus

Things are spiraling out of control

EXT NEW CHICAGO SKYLINE - DAYNIGHT - MONTAGE

Days flash past Perhaps a week Burnt skies giving way to
purple nights as the sun rises and falls in ACCELERATED TIME

A rooftop overlooking the city Erinyes crouches on the
ledge His black duster fluttering softly in the wind

The piano melody becomes a BROKEN DISCORDANT JANGLE As
those final notes linger in the air Erinyes whirls away

Night has fallen It’s time to go to work

INT ALLEY - MORNING - MONTAGE

And as the sun rises over New Chicago another gruesome
discovery awaits Tommy stands over an automobile riddled
with BULLET HOLES Two dead gangsters inside A Rorschach of
blood blooms across the cracked windshield

We PUSH IN on Tommy’s face Agony and anger Indecision and
regret Knowing things are only going to get worse
INT MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Conrad stands watch outside Lily’s room He straightens in a
hurry as Tommy comes around the corner

TOMMY
How is she

CONRAD
Hasn’t left the room
TOMMY
Take the rest of the night off
I’1l stay with her

Tommy hesitates at the door Glances back
TOMMY
I’msorry about your friend

Agent Creery

CONRAD
I appreciate that

TOMMY
Was hedid he have kids

CONRAD
Boy and a girl

Tommy nods heavily Two more names on his conscience

TOMMY
Can I ask you something What would
you do

CONRAD
Sir

TOMMY

If someone came after the people
you loved

Conrad stares at him uncertainly Then finds his courage

CONRAD
Id kill the son of a bitch Sir

TOMMY
You act like I haven’t tried
(Conrad hesitates)
What

CONRAD
It’s justthe men are talking

TOMMY
And what are they saying

Conrad swallows hard
CONRAD

They’re sayingthey’re saying
this guy’s got you spooked

CONRAD (CONTD)
Scared to leave the house And that
people are just gonna keep dying
Sir

Tommy stares at him for a dangerous beat But his anger never
surfaces Because deep down he knows Conrad is right

He turns away without another word

INT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Tommy enters the darkened bedroom Lily sits by the window
staring out across the city

He approaches her from behind Wraps his arms around her
pulling her close A soft kiss on the side of her neck

Lily doesn’t react Her mind a million miles away

EXT BARRACKS - LATE NIGHT

The barracks that Tommy’s men call home

INT BARRACKS - CONRAD’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

Conrad has just returned to his quarters He kneels on the
floor rummaging through his footlocker

Behind him the window swings open
A pair of black leather boots step softly to the floor
The curtains flutter Conrad finally notices turns--

Just as Erinyes steps out of the shadows pistol in hand

We SMASH CUT AWAY the gunshots still ringing in our ears

INT BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Tommy lowers Lily onto the bed His hands tracing the
contours of her body Caressing her whispering gentle words

The woman he loves is still in there somewhere All he needs
to do is reach her

But when he leans in for a kiss she turns away Tommy
finally notices that her cheeks are streaked with tears

TOMMY
What’s wrong
(No response )
Did something happen

When Lily finally speaks her voice is very faint

LILY
It wasn’t supposed to be like this

INT BARRACKS - CONRAD’S QUARTERS - SIMULTANEOUS

Erinyes attaches a copper wire to several bricks of PLASTIC
EXPLOSIVES Wiring the whole place to blow

INT BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Lily sits up in bed takes Tommy’s face in her hands

LILY
If I asked you to leave leave the
city tonight right now--

TOMMY
We talked about this--

LILY
Don’t say no don’t say anything
just come with me--

TOMMY
Lily--

LILY
(blurting it out)
Theyre going to kill you

Silence Her words hanging in the air

TOMMY
What did you do

She takes his hand Trying to find the right words

LILY
I didn’t want this You have to
believe me I never wanted it-—-

TOMMY
(jerking his hand away)
WHAT DID YOU DO

But before she can answer the window behind them flares
bright orange An instant later we hear a distant RUMBLE

Tommy is on his feet in a flash A few blocks away a massive

fireball is rising against the night sky

TOMMY
That’s the barracks

LILY
Tommy ——

Lily reaches for him frantic imploring But Tommy only has
eyes for the fire on the horizon

This is it His chance to end this fight once and for all

He brushes past Lily The door slams shut behind him

EXT BARRACKS - MOMENTS LATER

The barracks have been decimated Tongues of orange flame
rising skyward Injured gangsters hobbling past

Tommy skids to a halt staring in disbelief at the
devastation before him

INT MANSION - SIMULTANEOUS

Except we already know what’s happening back at the mansion

Erinyes pivots around the corner silenced pistols in hand
THWIP THWIP The guards topple to the ground

Erinyes takes the stairs two at a time

EXT BARRACKS - SIMULTANEOUS

Back at the barracks chaos reigns Men are still stumbling
out of the inferno clothing and hair ablaze

Tommy turns in a slow circle scanning the rooftops No sign
of Erinyes Which means this was a distraction

And too late he understands his mistake

TOMMY
Lily

INT MANSION - HALLWAY BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
Vic Francis fumbles desperately for his gun--

FRANCIS
Wait--

SHHHINNK Erinyes slams his retractable gauntlet blade into
Francis’s stomach without even slowing down

Lets the bedroom door swing open

Lily turns to face him

INT MANSION GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER

The mansion is silent We hear a sudden RUSH of air then
Tommy lands on the lawn with enough force to form a CRATER in
the soft earth He sprints for the house

INT MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Tommy bursts through the front door But there are no guards
to greet him the mansion appears deserted

TOMMY
LILY

Corpses litter the ground The floor slick with blood The
smell of cordite still thick in the air He’s too late

TOMMY
LILY

He races up the stairs Past Vic Francis’s body Wrenches
open the bedroom door--

But the room is empty

Lily is gone

INT MANSION - DAYDUSK

Tommy sits in the parlor head bowed motionless

Time moves around him at an ACCELERATED RATE The sun rising
to its zenith before plunging back down Tommy’s men

flickering through the frame like ghosts

And still Tommy doesn’t move a muscle

HARRIGAN (0S)
Tommy

Harrigan sinks heavily into the nearest chair Mops his brow

HARRIGAN
How you holding up
(Tommy says nothing )
We’re gonna get her back You know
that right She’s gonna be okay

Another pregnant silence Harrigan shifts in his seat

HARRIGAN
Tommy come on Talk to me

At last Tommy raises his head There’s a hollow resignation
in his voice that sends chills right down your spine

TOMMY
Did I ever tell you my first
memory The very first thing I can
remember It’s looking up at my
nanny looking into her eyes while
she held my head underwater
Because somehow this girl this
poor dumb kid had gotten it in her
head that I was the Antichrist So
one night after dinner she poured
a warm bath and she said a prayer
for us both and then she wrapped
her hands around my neck and spent
the next 20 minutes holding me
under I was two years old

Jesus Harrigan looks away sickened

TOMMY
Do you ever wonder if things could
have turned out differently

HARRIGAN
(finding his voice)
Yeah

TOMMY
I used to think about that a lot
But then I remember the look in
that girl’s eyes

Tommy stands moves to the window Gazes out across his city

TOMMY
I want to negotiate new terms

HARRIGAN
Terms for what

TOMMY
The surrender of Chicago

HARRIGAN
What are you talking about

TOMMY
Tell your bosses They can have it
back Tell themtell them I never
meant for any of this

HARRIGAN
(quietly)
What are you gonna do Tommy

Tommy doesn’t answer Doesn’t need to The answer is right
there in his eyes

INT MANSION - MONTAGE

Tommy wanders through the empty mansion His soldiers have
all deserted him Rats scurrying from a sinking ship

INT WAREHOUSE - MONTAGE

We recognize this scene Harrigan confronting Erinyes in the
abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town

HARRIGAN
We had him Do you not get that
Tommy wanted out

ERINYES

He doesn’t get to walk away Not
after what he’s done

INT MANSION - MONTAGE

And finally it’s too much Tommy flies into a rage Toppling
bookshelves Flipping the piano Ripping priceless works of
art from the walls and shredding them

INT WAREHOUSE - MONTAGE

Harrigan lets the corner of the tarp fall back into place We
still don’t see whatever is waiting underneath

HARRIGAN
(whispering)
What have you done

Harrigan whirls around furiousonly to find that Erinyes
is now pointing a pistol right at his chest

HARRIGAN
Goddamn it we had a plan

ERINYES
This was always the plan

Erinyes fires

INT MANSION - MONTAGE

Tommy takes the head off a marble bust of Julius Caesar with
a single punch Lets out a SCREAM of pure anguish

Exhausted defeated he finally sinks to his knees Chest
heaving Surrounded by the wreckage of his former life

And that’s when the telephone begins to RING

INT WAREHOUSE - MONTAGE
Harrigan motionless his jacket darkening with blood

Erinyes steps over the body approaches the object hidden
beneath the tarp With a flourish he whips the tarp away--

We see something large and metallic reflected in the
vigilante’s silver mask We can’t quite make out the details
INT MANSION - MONTAGE
Tommy takes a steadying breath Answers the ringing phone
BREATHING on the other end A tense moment of silence
ERINYES (0S)

I think it’s time we met
EXT OUTSIDE THE WAREHOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER
The warehouse The site of our final confrontation

A rush of air Then Tommy SLAMS into the frame landing like
a mortar shell He stands glances around

Notices Harrigan’s empty sedan parked out front

INT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Tommy wrenches open the door and steps into the warehouse

TOMMY
Harrigan

Erinyes’ mocking voice comes drifting out of the darkness

ERINYES (0S)
Your friend is already dead

Erinyes steps into view a few dozen paces away--
Tommy starts forward Murder in his eyes--

Erinyes immediately extends his arm He’s holding some sort
of DETONATOR DEVICE in his hand

ERINYES
That’s close enough

He cocks his head slightly Tommy follows his gaze--

And sees Lily bound and gagged in her chair They share a
brief anguished look Then he turns back to Erinyes

TOMMY
Why are you doing this

But Erinyes doesn’t reply Too busy savoring the moment

TOMMY
WHAT DO YOU WANT

ERINYES
I want you to know how it feels
When someone takes everything from
you I want you to know fear
Slowly Erinyes reaches up Pulls his mask aside--

It’s impossible It can’t be true But it is

Erinyes is Conrad

CONRAD
And then I want you to die

And we SMASH CUT TO BLACK

DISSOLVE TO

INT BANK —- DAY

We return to a familiar scene Tommy 24 years old robbing
his very first bank

FX CHICAGO 1934

He slips behind the counter Approaches the vault’s MASSIVE
IRON DOOR Glances around

TOMMY
Someone gonna open this

When no one responds Tommy clutches the vault door and TEARS
IT FREE FROM THE WALL Hurls it over his shoulder--

A sickening CRUNCH as the door lands somewhere offscreen
Several people SCREAM Tommy ignores them Enters the vault

Moments later Tommy emerges once more carrying several
bulging duffel bags He starts back across the lobby--

Only then does he notice where the vault door landed
Or more specifically on whom it landed

A woman’s purse A man’s pair of suede loafers poking out
from beneath the ugly iron rim

And kneeling beside the door THE 14 YEAR OLD BOY we glimpsed

earlier Shell-shocked his face streaked with tears
Tommy hesitates The boy raises his eyes meets Tommy’s gaze

Tommy searches for a way to apologize to explain that it was
an accident But the words don’t come

Instead he shoulders the duffel bags and continues onward
pushing through the front door and out into the sunlight

ANGLE on the boy’s face His grief and horror slowly seeping
away replaced by something else Cold loathing

Out on the street we hear the sounds of hell breaking loose
Police opening fire Glass shattering bullets ricocheting

But the boy doesn’t flinch Doesn’t even blink

SMASH CUT TO

CHAPTER THREE THE FURIES

MR STERN (0S)
Conrad Do you understand
everything we’ve told you

INT CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY

YOUNG CONRAD--the same boy we just met--sits at the end of
the boardroom table looking very small indeed

YOUNG CONRAD
Yes

Seated across from him are FOUR OLD MEN in expensive suits
MR STERN the head lawyer speaks

MR STERN

In lieu of an actual will we had
to make an educated guess regarding
your parents’ wishes But I think
youll be pleased with the results

(gestures to the others)
Mr Breckinridge will act as
conservator for Qualen Industries
until you and Sarah come of age
During that time Mr Dandish here
has agreed to serve as your legal
guardian

MR DANDISH
Think of me as an uncle

MR STERN
Your inheritance and controlling
shares will be held in escrow under
the supervision of Mr Holmes and
myself Now I know that’s a lot of
big words and you probably have a
great number of questions--

YOUNG CONRAD
When can I have my money

MR STERN
Naturally a portion will be set
aside for living expenses

MR STERN (CONTD)
The rest will be waiting for you on
the day you turn 18

YOUNG CONRAD
But what if I want it now

A few of the lawyers exchange smiles Just like a child

MR STERN
That’s what I’m trying to explain
Conrad We’re here to provide
anything you might need All you
have to do is ask

YOUNG CONRAD
Good Because I want to learn how
to fight

That wipes the smiles off their faces in a hurry

MR DANDISH
If it’s a matter of protection--

YOUNG CONRAD
It’s not

MR STERN
Well This iscertainly something
we can discuss at a later date

YOUNG CONRAD
No I think we’1l discuss it now

The boardroom doors open and several well-dressed LAWYERS
enter Silently take their positions behind Conrad’s chair

MR STERN
What is this

YOUNG CONRAD
I took the liberty of arranging my
own counsel This company belongs
to me And I will not see it bled
dry by greed and incompetence Mr
Stern Mr Breckinridge Mr
Holmes Mr Dandish Your services
are no longer required

The old men can only stare

INT QUALEN PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

The Qualen family’s spacious penthouse A servant silently
arranges food before Young Conrad

At the far end of the table sits Conrad’s little sister
SARAH She’s perhaps six years old heartbreakingly sad

Conrad takes a bite Notices that Sarah is simply picking at
her food shuffling it around the plate

YOUNG CONRAD
Sarah You have to eat

YOUNG SARAH
I want Mom

YOUNG CONRAD
Mom’s dead

She snuffles looks away sullenly

YOUNG SARAH
I want her to come home

YOUNG CONRAD
Dead means you don’t get to come
home You’re just dead

Sarah considers this

YOUNG SARAH
Does it hurt when you die

YOUNG CONRAD
Yes

YOUNG SARAH
Is the bad man in jail

YOUNG CONRAD
No

YOUNG SARAH
Dad said if you kill someone
youre supposed to go to jail

YOUNG CONRAD
A lot of things are supposed to
happen But they don’t

YOUNG SARAH
Why

Conrad stares across the long table The first glimmer of
obsession burning in his eyes like a fever

YOUNG CONRAD
Because people are scared

INT GYMNASIUM - DAY

The gymnasium alone is probably larger than your entire
house Padded foam floors Weight racks balance beams

Barefoot and wearing loose-fitting robes Young Conrad
practices his striking techniques on a training dummy

The door opens and GARMAN shambles in A burly British guy
with a shaved head dense with ropy muscle

GARMAN
Looking for Mr Qualen

YOUNG CONRAD

You must be Mr Garman

(shaking his hand)
I understand you’re something of an
expert when it comes to baritsu I
read all about it in Conan Doyle
The Empty House fantastic story
Anyway Ready to get started

GARMAN
Started

YOUNG CONRAD
With my training

Garman peers about uncertainly Is this a joke
GARMAN
Guy on the phone didn’t say nothing
about no kid
YOUNG CONRAD
And is that going to be a problem
for you Hitting a kid

GARMAN
What now I’m supposed to hit you

YOUNG CONRAD
If you want the job

Garman shakes his head in amusement Then shrugs

GARMAN
Hell It’s your dime

He steps onto the padded mat circles the boy

GARMAN
Right then First things Baritsu
it’s all about momentum Waiting
for the other fella to make his
move then turning it back around--

YOUNG CONRAD
I’m not paying you to talk

Garman hesitatesthen lunges forward striking with the
flat of his palm But his attack is tentative half-hearted
already pulling his punch before it lands--

Conrad is faster He sidesteps grapples with Garman’s wrist
even as he slides behind the man and drives a heel into the
back of Garman’s knee Garman spills forward onto the mat

Conrad calmly turns and heads for the door

YOUNG CONRAD
There will be a car waiting for you
out front Thanks for your time

GARMAN
Wait

Garman heaves himself to his feet All jocularity has dropped
away his face has become a stony mask

The two opponents study each other in silence

Then Garman attacks And this time he doesn’t hold back A
flurry of strikes and leg sweeps driving Conrad backward
across the mat faster and faster--

WHUMP One of Garman’s blows finally connects catching
Conrad right in the chest Conrad goes flying backwards
Skids across the mat flat on his back

Garman stops immediately Shit Please dont be dead

Conrad coughs sits up Wincing as he massages his chest He
climbs unsteadily to his feet swaying a bit

Then takes his fighting stance once more

YOUNG CONRAD
Now show me how you did that

Garman grins

INT QUALEN PENTHOUSE - MONTAGE

Sarah sits at the piano plunking out a HALTING CHILDLIKE
MELODY THAT CARRIES THROUGHOUT THIS MONTAGE--

We see Young Conrad training with Garman His form already
more confident his attacks surgical in their precision

But that’s only one aspect of his training--

IN THE GYM Free weights and gymnastic practice Push-ups
sit-ups lunges Agility exercises on the balance beam

AT THE SHOOTING RANGE Conrad hefts a comically large pistol
Takes aim at the paper targets Fires

As the years blur past the piano melody becomes confident
faster more percussive Until it almost sounds military in
nature Like a march to war

Conrad is no longer a boy Childish fat giving way to layers
of lean muscle This is the ADULT CONRAD we already know

IN THE GYM Sparring with a Japanese teacher dueling with bo
staffs He disarms the teacher with brutal efficiency

IN THE BOARDROOM Chastising a roomful of executives Laying
out his plans for the future of Qualen Industries

IN THE GYM Attacking the speed bags a blur of motion
Hoisting a stack of plates on the bench press Suspending his
body between the parallel bars

He’s honing his body past the point of any Olympic athlete

Transforming himself into a living breathing weapon

INT QUALEN PENTHOUSE - DAY

Conrad emerges from the gym mopping sweat from his face He
follows the sound of PIANO MUSIC through the penthouse--

SARAH--now an adult--sits at the piano her back to the
camera Conrad pauses to watch Shakes his head

CONRAD
Youre off-tempo And don’t slouch

Sarah subtly adjusts her posture Keeps playing

CONRAD
You did something with your hair
(beat)
It doesn’t suit you I’1l have
Caleb set another appointment Next
time ask me first

Conrad strides off without another word We slowly PAN AROUND
the young woman as she continues to play--

Until we see her face

Conrads sister is the woman we know as LILY DAVERS

EXT NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - MORNING

FX NEW YORK CITY 1946

Dawn breaks over the city’s iconic skyline The Empire State
Building towering high above the rest of the skyscrapers
EXT QUALEN INDUSTRIES - CONTINUOUS

A 40s-era taxicab rolls to a stop before a gleaming recently
completed highrise QUALEN INDUSTRIES

Harrigan climbs out of the taxi passes a bill to the DRIVER

HARRIGAN
I need change back

DRIVER
Course ya do

He crams a battered fedora onto his brow straightens the
cheap tie around his neck Then heads inside

INT QUALEN RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER

The height of elegance The floor is reflective marble A
RECEPTIONIST behind a curved mahogany desk That Matisse on
the wall looks suspiciously like an original

Harrigan shifts uncomfortably in his chair leg tapping out a
staccato rhythm Crosses one leg Thinks better and uncrosses
it again Is it hot in here Christ he’s sweating

RECEPTIONIST
Mr Qualen will see you now

INT QUALEN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Wait scratch that this is the height of elegance The view
alone must be worth at least a couple million

Conrad springs out of his chair when Harrigan shuffles in

CONRAD
Mr Harrigan Thanks so much for
coming Conrad Qualen

HARRIGAN
(shaking hands awkwardly)
Good to meetcha

CONRAD
Here sit sit

Harrigan sinks into a plush couch Fish out of water

HARRIGAN
Hell of a view you got there

CONRAD
You should see the birds smack it
(Harrigan remains blank)
Sorry I’m not good with jokes

HARRIGAN
Oh Birds right
(An awkward beat)
There some reason you wanted to see
me Mr Qualen

CONRAD
Yes What can you tell me about
Tommy Anders

Harrigan sighs He was afraid of something like this

HARRIGAN
Sorry pal you got the wrong guy

CONRAD
I don’t think so I’ve been
following your career Mr
Harrigan The signing of the
Treaty Everything that came after
All that negative press Threats
against your family Changing
schools houses the divorce

Harrigan’s expression is growing stormier by the second

HARRIGAN
The hell is this

CONRAD
You have Tommy’s confidence and
full access to the city I’m going
to need both

HARRIGAN
I think we’re done here

Harrigan lurches out of his chair Heads for the door

CONRAD
Agent Harrigan Aren’t you even
going to ask why

HARRIGAN
No I know why ‘Cuz you’re rich
and you’re bored and that makes
you dangerous You wanna get your
kicks meet the guy that won the
war maybe shake his hand You go
right ahead Leave me out of it

CONRAD
I’m going to kill him

Everything stops Like the air was just sucked out of the
room Slowly Harrigan lets his hand fall from the doorknob

CONRAD
But I can’t do that unless I know
exactly what I’m dealing with

Harrigan takes his seat Considers Conrad for a careful beat

HARRIGAN
What you’re dealing with is a man
that’s got bulletproof skin an IQ
that’s off the charts and his own
private army And lemme tell you
something if he knew we were here
talking like this We’d already be
dead So you want my advice Forget
you ever saw me ‘Cuz this thing
here It can’t be done

CONRAD
Alexander the Great conquered the
whole world and died from a
mosquito bite Power still has its
limits We just have to find them

INT SCREENING ROOM - LATER

A darkened screening room Harrigan takes a seat as Conrad
fires up the bulky projector GRAINY BLACK-AND-WHITE FOOTAGE
flickers to life on the screen

The silent footage shows scientists in some sort of high-tech
RESEARCH FACILITY Old men in tweed coats arguing in
pantomime before a whiteboard Workers in lead vests wheeling
containers of hazardous materials past the camera

CONRAD
Palo Alto California Owned and
operated by Qualen Industries

Conrad nods to the screen It shows a severe-looking man
striding through the workspace issuing orders

CONRAD
Julius Robert Oppenheimer The
architect of the Manhattan Project
Ever heard of it

HARRIGAN
No

Oppenheimer notices the camera gives it a dismissive wave

CONRAD
A team of scientists tasked by
Roosevelt with developing a new
type of weapon A bomb One that
would harnesses the power of the
atom itself

More grainy footage Oppenheimer greeting a group of visiting
consultants Christ is that Albert Einstein

CONRAD

It was a weapon to end all wars
But as it turned out we didn’t
need it Because we had Tommy

(shrugs)
After the war the project became a
political liability The public had
grown tired of war They finally
pulled the plug in 1941

HARRIGAN
And then you came along
CONRAD
And then I came along I used our
defense contracts to track down key
members Gave them the resources to
continue their work

Onscreen the camera circles a bulky steel cone It’s
unmistakably a WARHEAD Harrigan looks stunned

HARRIGAN
(softly)
You built the damn thing

Conrad only smiles

INT QUALEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT
Conrad pours a round of whisky for Harrigan and himself

HARRIGAN
And you really think this is gonna
work Your little bomb

CONRAD
That little bomb has a ten mile
blast radius and the concussive
force of forty thousand tons of
TNT Trust me It’1ll do the job

A new thought strikes Harrigan Not a pleasant one

HARRIGAN
And where exactly is this gonna
happen

CONRAD

I’ve had QI subsidiaries purchasing
land north of the city So far
weve got fifty miles of empty
farmland We’1ll lure Tommy there

HARRIGAN
Yeah maybe we can give him a
treasure map X marks the spot

CONRAD
Is that a joke

HARRIGAN
Starting to think this whole
thing’s a joke I’m telling you
Tommy’s too smart He’s gonna know
it’s a trap

CONRAD
Not if we’ve done our jobs

INT QUALEN’S OFFICE - DAY

Now try to keep up because we’re going to be jumping back

LILY
No I can’t do this I’m sorry--

CONRAD
You don’t have a choice This
thing’s already in motion

LILY
Then call it off We can still call
it off Conrad Please

CONRAD
Listen to yourself That man took
everything from us And now you
want to walk away because what
youre scared
(shakes head in disgust)
If our parents could see you now

Lily hangs her head crushed
Conrad softens Gently touches his sister’s cheek

You can do this You’re a Qualen
That means you’re strong

Conrad paces in the empty warehouse He freezes at the sound
of approaching FOOTSTEPS

After an agonizing beat the warehouse door slides open and
Erinyes slips through He’s moving with a distinct limp

Where have you been

Instead of answering Erinyes collapses onto a stack of
pallets Pulls his mask aside revealing CREERY He’s red-
faced gasping clearly in pain

examines it Sure enough a bullet is embedded in the mesh

Like hell Knocked meknocked me
off the damn roof--

Conrad doesn’t seem particularly concerned as he begins
suiting up Snapping the chestplate into place

But as Creery turns away we notice something alarming All
the emotion bleeds out of Conrad’s face His expression
becoming stony Remorseless

Because no one is going to interfere with his plan No one

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Creery makes his way down the hall carrying a brown paper
parcel He knocks on the door to Tommy’s office Inside
Tommy is arguing with Vic Francis and John Nelly

CREERY
Found this out front

just bring it into my home

CREERY
It’s not a bomb or nothing The

Then he pulls the trigger

INT TOMMY’S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

Creery takes a wobbling step backward Blinking in surprise
as he touches his chest His hand comes away bloody

Then he topples over Dead before he hits the floor

As Tommy and his lieutenants stare in shock we hear an
OMINOUS RUMBLE building in the background like the sound of
a jet engine revving to life As the rumble reaches its apex
WE SKIP FORWARD IN TIME--

EXT ROOFTOP STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

Just as Conrad HURLS himself off the rooftop attached to the
zZip-line cable He goes streaking toward the ground--

WHOOOM The plastic explosives strategically planted across
the roof erupt simultaneously A blinding FIREBALL

Conrad hits the ground in a combat roll A black sedan is
idling nearby Phelps hunkered behind the wheel

Conrad throws himself onto the roof of the car just as Tommy
hits the ground like an artillery shell

CONRAD
GO GO

Phelps punches it The sedan rockets forward--

But Tommy is right behind them His legs a blur of motion
Clothing ablaze Gaining ground fast--

Just as they reach the parked gas tanker Conrad whips out a
handheld RADIO DETONATOR Hits the button--

WHOOOOOSH The second explosion lifts Tommy off his feet
sends him flying headlong into the nearest building

Conrad holds on tight as the sedan screams around the next
corner That was too damn close

EXT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

They’ve ditched the sedan in an empty alley Conrad strips
out of the Erinyes costume stashing each piece in a nearby
dumpster Nearby Phelps is also changing clothes

PHELPS
Did it work

CONRAD
Definitely got his attention

Phelps looks badly rattled He manages a shaky laugh
PHELPS
You see that guy jump Christ
Never seen anything like that
CONRAD
(matter-of-fact)
Creery didn’t make it

Phelps freezes Not sure if he heard that right

PHELPS
What do you mean didn’t make it

CONRAD
Tommy used him as a human shield I
didn’t have a choice

PHELPS
You shot him

Conrad whirls around angrily

CONRAD
I said I didn’t have a choice

Phelps stares him down for an uneasy beat Wanting to believe
Conrad’s story But not entirely convinced

CONRAD
It was an accident

Phelps deflates Shakes his head in disgust

PHELPS
Shit

Conrad drops the mask into the dumpster slams the lid
CONRAD
Let’s just do what we came for
INT MANSION - SHORT TIME LATER

Conrad and Phelps enter the mansion It’s still in turmoil
Guards rushing off to help put out the fires in the distance

Conrad climbs the stairs Finds Tommy sitting on the bathroom
floor his back to the door cradling Lily in his arms A
reverse angle of the scene from page 70

Lily meets Conrads gaze over Tommy’s shoulder He silently
mouths the words “Are you all right”

But Lily simply stares back at him Loathing in her eyes

INT MANSION - HALLWAY - DAY

Conrad stands watch outside Tommy’s bedroom Ever so slowly
the door cracks open Lily hovers on the other side

Conrad keeps his gaze fixed straight ahead Speaking quietly

CONRAD
You were never in danger The
bullet would have missed

LILY
That’s not what Tommy said

CONRAD
I know where I was aiming

LILY
You could have said something
Warned me

CONRAD
Your reaction had to be real

A pause Lily mustering her courage

LILY
You’re wrong about him He’s not
evil He’s done bad things sure
he’s made mistakes-—-

CONRAD
Mistakes He killed our parents

LILY
He wants to change

CONRAD
Tell me you’re not buying this
That you’re not really this stupid
LILY
I’m just saying Maybe there’s
another way

Without warning Conrad loses his cool He whirls around
SLAMMING the door open with his palm Lily recoils

Now we see just how unhinged Conrad has become No sympathy
in those eyes Just the first sick glimmer of madness

CONRAD
Do I have to worry about you now

The question hangs in the air Finally Lily lowers her gaze

LILY
No

CONRAD
I hope you’re right

He closes the door in her face

INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Agent Harrigan paces restlessly inside the abandoned
warehouse He pauses to light another cigar--

Then notices an orange FLICKER in the darkness The light
from his own match reflected off a silver mask

HARRIGAN
How long you been there
(No reply)

Anyway Got your message

Erinyes doesn’t approach Doesn’t say anything Just remains
perched there atop the boxes It’s a little disconcerting

HARRIGAN
The hell’s your problem Come on
take off the mask already

ERINYES
No

He speaks in a gravelly whisper Not Conrad’s regular voice

HARRIGAN

(giving up)
So what’s the big rush

ERINYES
Take this back to New York The
dead drop on 42nd My contact will
take it from there

Erinyes flicks a folded piece of paper that lands at
Harrigan’s feet He stoops down opens the note--

Revealing lines of RANDOM NUMERICAL DIGITS

HARRIGAN
This some kinda code
(No answer)
Gonna tell me what it says

ERINYES
Delivery instructions for the
device We may need to accelerate
our timeframe

HARRIGAN
Accelerate ourthe hell’s that
supposed to mean

ERINYES
I don’t trust my sister She may
already be compromised

HARRIGAN
Whaddya mean compromised And take
off that goddamned mask

ERINYES
The mask stays on

That gives Harrigan pause Wondering--probably not for the
first time--just how stable Conrad really is

HARRIGAN
Conrad-—

ERINYES
Erinyes

HARRIGAN

(holding up the note)
How accelerated are we talking
about here

ERINYES
Just see that it gets done

The silver mask melts backwards into the shadows

Leaving Harrigan alone once more

INT MANSION - NIGHT
The spacious dining room Tommy and Lily eating in silence

Conrad is on duty standing watch in the next room his back
turned to give them the illusion of privacy

Lily studies Tommy from across the table His evident
exhaustion The SCORCH MARKS on the cuffs of his jacket

LILY
It happened again didn’t it

TOMMY
One of the factories downtown
There was another bombing

LILY
Was it bad

It takes Tommy a moment to find his voice

TOMMY
These peoplethey weren’t
soldiers they weren’t anything
You want to know what they were
making down there Fluorescent
lamps And he killed them for it

Lily says nothing Guilt hanging over her like a thunderhead
Tommy notices her discomfort tries to change the subject

TOMMY
Tell me about your brother
Matthew What was he like

Tommy takes another bite Doesn’t notice the way that Lily’s
eyes instinctively flicker over to Conrad’s position

LILY
Hehe always took care of me
Especially after our parents died
It was just the two of us

TOMMY
Must have been tough

LILY
I was so little I don’t think I
really understood it at the time
What was happening It was harder
on Matthew Growing up so fast It
changed him

Lily’s gaze becomes distant Lost in her own memories This
is no longer part of the script This is real

LILY
I knew this girl once a friend
from school who got diagnosed with
lymphoma And I remember right
before the end if you got close
enough you could feel thisthis
heat coming off her in waves
Matthew was like that All that
anger it was like it was eating
him from the inside And if you got
too close you could feel it Like
he was on fire I used to wonder
how can anyone live like that

Conrad’s expression has grown hollow lifeless Every word is
another dagger in his side

TOMMY
I shouldn’t have brought it up

LILY
It’s all right He died a long time
ago You know the worst part I
don’t even miss him anymore

Tommy reaches across the table Takes her hand
TOMMY
I say he couldn’t have been that
bad You turned out okay

Lily smiles back Squeezes his hand

Conrad watches them from the doorway

EXT CHICAGO STREETS - NIGHT

The streets are empty The taverns all closed their windows
boarded up Everyone has left or gone into hiding

Except for Tommy’s armed patrols that is Here’s one of them
now a black sedan gliding down the street headlights off
Inside two GANGSTERS nervously scan the rooftops

They turn the next corner The driver slows peering ahead--

GANGSTER 1
That one of ours

A deserted sedan idles by the entrance to an alley both
doors open No sign of its former occupants

GANGSTER 2
Go slow

They creep closer Weapons at the ready--

Gangster 2 raises a high-powered flashlight angles the beam
into the darkened alley--

GANGSTER 2
Holy God

Erinyes crouches over a thug slowly choking the life out of
him Behind him another gangster dangles from the fire
escape a wire noose around his neck legs still kicking

Erinyes’ head whips around just as the light strikes him
Then he takes off Bolting into the shadows

GANGSTER 2
Go go

The driver punches it The car blasts down the alley
narrowly missing the unconscious thug on the ground The
dangling man’s legs have already stopped moving

INT ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Erinyes races around the corner The sedan right behind him
Gangster 2 hanging out the window firing wildly--

Bullets pinging off the concrete all around Erinyes--
The car plowing through debris--

Without slowing Erinyes flings a handful of small silver
objects to the ground--

A split-second later the phosphorous charges DETONATE
flaring white-hot Momentarily blinded the driver loses
control and the car skews sideways into the wall kicking up
a shower of sparks

Erinyes has reached a wrought-iron fence perhaps ten feet
high He launches himself into the air--

KICKS off the nearest wall propelling himself up and over--
And lands in a smooth crouch on the other side

The driver hits the brakes a moment too late The car SLAMS
headlong into the fence and comes to a shuddering halt

Gangster 2 leans out the window Has time for a single shot--

The bullet catches Erinyes in his side missing the body
armor entirely punching all the way through

Erinyes staggers Braces himself against the wall Then keeps
going limping off into the darkness

GANGSTER 1
Tell me you got him

Gangster 2 can only shrug helplessly No idea

INT BARRACKS - CONRAD’S QUARTERS - LATE NIGHT

Conrad kneels beside his footlocker organizing his gear
Weve seen this scene twice before Except this is the first
time we’ve gotten a good look at Conrad’s face

His lips moving in a silent litany Blinking erratically
Skin clammy beneath a sheen of sweat

Behind him a shadow appears on the window ledge--

Conrad notices the slight breeze and turns to find Erinyes
standing before him swaying slightly

CONRAD
Have you lost your mind What if
someone saw you
Erinyes drops his gun and collapses into the nearest chair

Conrad peels the mask away revealing PHELPS His skin a
sickly shade of white He’s lost a lot of blood

PHELPS
(forcing it out)
H-hurts

Phelps hisses in pain as Conrad unclasps the battle armor
tugs it free Examines the bullet wound in Phelps’s side

CONRAD
How did you let this happen

PHELPS
Hospitalplease

Conrad paces the room Panicking All his carefully laid
plans crashing down around his head

PHELPS
Conrad

Conrad stops His expression suddenly thoughtful
Because maybe it’s not too late to salvage this situation
He glances back at Phelps Forces a comforting smile

CONRAD
Don’t worry We’ll get some help

Phelps sighs gratefully Closes his eyes

Conrad picks up the silenced pistol from the floor Hesitates
for only a moment

Then grabs a pillow jams it over Phelps’s face and pulls
the trigger twice in quick succession

Now it’s time to go to work

Conrad suits up quickly fastening the battle armor into
place Slips the silver mask over his head

He steps over Phelps’s body Trailing a thin copper wire
across the room One end attached to a timer

The other to a fat stack of PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES

INT TOMMY’S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

A reverse angle of Tommy and Lilys conversation from page
74 She’s on the verge of confessing everything

LILY
If I asked you to leave leave the
city tonight right now--

TOMMY
We talked about this--

LILY
Don’t say no don’t say anything
just come with me--

TOMMY
Lily--

LILY
Theyre going to kill you

Tommy stares at her Horrible realization flooding in

TOMMY
What did you do

LILY
I didn’t want this You have to
believe me I never wanted it-—-

TOMMY
WHAT DID YOU DO

At that moment a fireball blossoms on the horizon
accompanied by a RUMBLE that rattles the windowpanes

Erinyes just blew the barracks

INT TOMMY’S BEDROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

We SKIP FORWARD IN TIME Lily stands at the window
brokenhearted watching the fire rage in the distance

Knowing she’s lost Tommy Lost him forever

A disturbance from somewhere in the mansion Cries of pain
Muffled gunshots The sounds are getting closer

Lily knows what’s coming Closes her eyes

From the corridor outside we hear Vic Francis’s voice--

FRANCIS (0S)
Wait--

SHHHINNK The sound of Erinyes’ retractable blade punching
through warm human flesh A THUD as the body hits the floor

Then the door swings open Erinyes silhouetted in the doorway
like some insane avenging angel

LILY
Tommy knows I told him everything

Erinyes ignores this He strides across the room seizes
Lily’s wrist forcibly drags her toward the door

LILY
Let go Conrad--

She jerks free Erinyes whirls back around--

Just as Lily grabs a lamp from the dresser and swings it with

all her might The lamp shatters against his skull

Erinyes drops to his knees Lily stands over him brandishing
the broken lamp like a baseball bat

LILY
I won’t let you do this
(beat)
Pick a direction and start walking

Silently Erinyes rises to his feeta dark specter looming
over herthe beat drags out

Then without warning Erinyes LUNGES FORWARD hands closing
around Lilys throat just as we SMASH CUT TO BLACK

INT HARRIGAN’S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING - MONTAGE

All the sound bleeds out of the world The following montage
is ENTIRELY SILENT

We see Harrigan being awoken in the middle of the night by a
phone call Listening in stunned disbelief

EXT PARK SLOPE - EARLY MORNING - MONTAGE

Harrigan saying his final goodbyes to his ex-wife and
daughter Pushing the dollhouse into Cathy’s hands Embracing

them both Then turning and hurrying away

Before they can see the tears in his eyes

INT MANSION - DAY - MONTAGE

Tommy sits alone in the shadows Head bowed Grief and fury
playing across his face in equal measure

INT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
THE SILENT MONTAGE ENDS as Lily slowly regains consciousness

And finds herself in the derelict warehouse Tied securely to
a chair a rag stuffed in her mouth

On the far side of the warehouse floor Harrigan and Erinyes
are arguing in low tones Harrigan gestures emphatically

HARRIGAN
We had him Do you not get that
Tommy wanted out

ERINYES
He doesn’t get to walk away Not
after what he’s done

HARRIGAN
Youre out of your mind--

Harrigan finally notices the object hidden beneath the tarp
He brushes past Erinyes Rips the tarp away--

REVEALING THE NUCLEAR WARHEAD DEVICE The bomb that was
supposed to be detonated in the middle of nowhere

Now we understand what Conrad meant by “accelerating the
timeframe” He’s going to destroy the entire city

HARRIGAN
What have you done
(turning)
Goddamn it we had a plan

ERINYES
This was always the plan

Lily jumps as the GUNSHOT rings out Watches helplessly as
Harrigan crumples to the floor As Erinyes fires two more
rounds into the agent before turning away

Lily redoubles her efforts straining against her bonds--

Suddenly Erinyes looms over her Not saying anything Just
staring Lily’s face reflected in that horrible silver mask

Slowly he reaches out and caresses her cheek There’s
something invasive--almost lascivious--about the gesture

She recoils from his touch With a shrug he turns away

INT MANSION - MOMENTS LATER
From somewhere in the mansion a phone begins to RING
Tommy picks up the receiver Hears only ominous breathing
ERINYES (0S)
I think it’s time we met
INT WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Erinyes moves quickly now He peels off his leather
gauntlets drops them to the floor

He approaches the nuclear warhead Begins flipping a series
of dials and switches Initiating a countdown sequence

INT WAREHOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

The warehouse is silent Harrigan’s body sprawled across the
floor Lily still struggling in her chair

Erinyes runs his fingers lovingly across the surface of the
warhead Cocks his head slightly listening--

An IMPACT reverberates from somewhere outside The sound of
Tommy slamming to the ground after another giant leap

Erinyes melts backwards into the shadows
It’s time
We hear the front door creak open Tommy’s voice calls out

TOMMY (0S)
Harrigan

ERINYES
Your friend is already dead

Erinyes steps into view Tommy starts toward him but he
quickly holds up the RADIO DETONATOR DEVICE

ERINYES
That’s close enough

He motions toward Lily Tommy gazes at her for an anguished
beat then turns his attention back to Erinyes

TOMMY
Why are you doing this
(No response )
WHAT DO YOU WANT

ERINYES
I want you to know how it feels
When someone takes everything from
you I want you to know fear

With a flourish Erinyes rips his mask away Revealing his
true face Conrad

CONRAD
And then I want you to die

Silence Tommy circles Conrad cautiously studying him

TOMMY
Except we both know you’re not very
good at killing me

CONRAD
I’m just getting started
(gestures to the warhead)
See that It’s called the atom
bomb Power on a scale you can’t
even begin to imagine I press this
button and Chicago’s a parking lot

TOMMY
If that’s true you’re not walking
out of here either

CONRAD
You think I don’t know that I made
my peace a long time ago

TOMMY
And what about Lily All those
people out there What do you call
them

CONRAD
A fair trade

Tommy seems shaken by the sheer intensity of Conrad’s hatred
As we watch the anger seeps out of Tommy Replaced by
something close to pity

TOMMY
Whatever I did to youI’m sorry

Conrad wasn’t expecting that But he recovers quickly

CONRAD
Do you know what it’s like watching
them throw a parade for the man who
murdered your parents Who took
everything from you

TOMMY
You want to hurt me Hurt me I
won’t fight back Just let her go

Conrad barks laughter Waves the detonator at Lily

CONRAD
Are you hearing this
(back to Tommy)
You stupid bastard you still don’t
get it She was in on the whole
thing She set you up

Tommy stares at Lily his expression unreadable She gazes
back miserably tears in her eyes I’m so sorry

Finally Tommy turns back to Conrad Shrugs calmly

TOMMY
I don’t care

Conrad blinks Can’t quite process that
CONRAD
You don’t care She was lying to

your face

TOMMY
Then I’11 forgive her

Conrad reels on his feet breathing like a steam engine It
wasn’t supposed to be like this Tommy was supposed to
grovel to sob and curse to beg for his life
Ten years of planning A lifetime of hatred
All in vain
TOMMY
You can still let her go Give her

the chance we never had

Conrad takes a steading breath Meets Tommy’s gaze

And we realize in a split-second what he’s about to do
CONRAD
It’s not what you did It’s that
you got away with it That was the
crime
He raises the detonator--
SHHHINNK
Everything freezes The sound still ringing in our ears
Conrads expression slowly goes slack
The detonator slips from his hand Clatters to the floor
ANGLE on Conrad His mouth moving soundlessly
AS AGENT HARRIGAN RISES INTO VIEW BEHIND HIM
HARRIGAN
And that was your spinal cord you
son of a bitch

Harrigan is wearing one of Erinyes’ discarded gauntlets

And he just plunged the retractable blade deep into Conrad’s
lower back Paralyzing him from the neck down

As we watch Harrigan gives the blade a vicious TWIST

Conrad sways on his feet A single tear escapes his eye goes
careening down his cheek

Then he topples over Dead

Harrigan collapses beside him The agent has lost too much
blood the only thing keeping him alive at this point is
sheer force of will But now that’s slipping away as well

Tommy rushes over Harrigan waves him off

HARRIGAN
Get the girl

Tommy reaches Lily’s side Tugs her gag aside easily snaps
the cords around her wrists and ankles

LILY
Tommy ——

TOMMY
It’s okay--

LILY
The bomb He did something to the
bomb
Shit Tommy races over to the warhead Stares at the dizzying
array of cables and switches Knowing that somewhere deep
inside its mechanical guts a timer is counting down

TOMMY
Harrigan Tell me what to do

But Harrigan only shakes his head He doesn’t know

From inside the warhead’s casing we hear an ominous METALLIC
CLICKING NOISE Gradually speeding up

Tommy is rooted to the spot

He turns to Lily Sees the helpless terror in her eyes
And makes his decision

Somehow Lily understands what he’s about to do

LILY
Tommy

In an act of Herculean strength Tommy lifts the massive
warhead off the ground dropping to one knee even as he flips

the bomb over his head and onto his shoulders--

THEN LAUNCHES HIMSELF STRAIGHT UP INTO THE SKY

Tommy explodes through the warehouse roof Lily stumbles back
as bits of debris come raining down--

EXT CHICAGO SKYLINE - CONTINUOUS

Tommy rockets higher and higher into the sky carrying the
warhead with him

And as he continues to climb we realize the truth

That wasn’t a jump He’s actually flying

INT WAREHOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

Harrigan watches Tommy’s ascent The ghost of a smile on the
old agent’s lips

HARRIGAN
Can’t fly my ass

Then he closes his eyes for the last time

And as for Lily She can only watch as the man she loves
vanishes into the night sky

EXT UPPER ATMOSPHERE - SIMULTANEOUS

And still Tommy continues to climb

The earth dozens of miles beneath him now as he reaches the
upper layers of the stratosphere

All the sound BLEEDS OUT Now all we can hear is the sharp
CLICKING of the warhead’s internal timer

Getting faster

Tommy grits his teeth The friction tearing at his body his
clothes bursting into flames--

CLICK CLICK CLICK

Then a sudden silence

INT WAREHOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

Lily closes her eyes

As a WHITE LIGHT washes over the screen
Swallowing us whole

DISSOLVE TO
WHITE

After a somber pause we gradually FADE BACK IN

EXT CHICAGO SKYLINE - DAY - MONTAGE

An iron flagpole silhouetted against the morning sun As we
watch an AMERICAN FLAG is hoisted into frame

We PULL BACK revealing the flagpole sits atop Chicago’s
iconic WRIGLEY BUILDING
EXT CHICAGO STREETS - MONTAGE

The streets are jammed with automobiles and moving vans The
sidewalks busy with pedestrians

We see the new MAYOR posing for a photo with the POLICE
COMMISSIONER and several other politicians on the steps of
City Hall The mayor holds up a newspaper beaming The
headline reads TOMMY ANDERS DEAD

EXT WRIGLEY FIELD - MONTAGE

A baseball game is in progress The bleachers packed with
cheering fans Life has returned to Chicago

EXT LINCOLN PARK - DAY - MONTAGE

A massive outdoor ceremony taking place in Lincoln Park The
unveiling of a new statue Half the city must be in
attendance Political dignitaries gathered on the dais One
of them happens to be PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN

Joining them on the dais are a few familiar faces Harrigan’s
daughter CATHY and her new husband MARTIN His ex-wife ELLEN

The curtain is ripped away and the statue is unveiled A 15-
foot replica of HARRIGAN himself Even immortalized in
bronze he still looks rumpled slightly disheveled But we’d
recognize that lopsided grin anywhere

The crowd bursts into applause Flashbulbs explode

Back on the dais President Truman solemnly shakes Cathy’s
hand She smiles back at him her eyes filling with tears

We PUSH IN on Harrigan’s statue Closer and closer Until we
can make out the words engraved on the pedestal

IN MEMORY OF PAUL HARRIGAN
THE MAN WHO SAVED CHICAGO

DISSOLVE TO

EXT LINCOLN PARK - DUSK

The ceremony has ended the park has cleared out Only a few
stragglers remain Lovers stroll hand in hand A nurse pushes
a baby carriage down the path An elderly man on a park bench
scatters crumbs for a flock of pigeons

LILY stands alone before the statue gazing up at Harrigan’s
likeness We sense none of her former fragility The last few
months have brought her some measure of inner peace

Behind her the sun dips toward the horizon Transforming the
surface of Lake Michigan into molten glass
Lily smiles softly Turns away

She crosses the park Takes a seat on the bench next to the
ELDERLY MAN feeding the pigeons

We only see the man from behind He’s bald his skin cracked
and leathery dressed in a faded blue suit

Except now that we look closer we start to wonder just how
old he really is Because beneath that ratty old suit he
looks powerfully built His shoulders unbowed by time

Slowly Lily reaches out and takes the man’s hand

And together they watch as the sky turns to gold

FADE OUT

THE END
