ENCANTO

Written by

Charise Castro Smith and Jared Bush
ENCANTO 1

OVER BLACK

WE HEAR the sounds of nighttime in a COLOMBIAN CLOUD FOREST
birds insects nature Then the voice of an older woman
warm nurturing and intimate

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
Abre los ojos open your eyes

FADE UP ON The closed eyes of five-year-old MIRABEL

MADRIGAL light of a CANDLE reflects in her over-sized green-
rimmed glasses Mirabel opens one eye then the other to find
a wondrous MAGICAL CANDLE rippling with firelight magic

YOUNG MIRABEL
This is where our magic comes from

ABUELA ALMA
Mm-hmm this candle holds the
miracle given to our family

YOUNG MIRABEL
How did we get a miracle

Alma pulls Mirabel onto her lap and the light of the candle
grows As Alma speaks we dissolve to her as a young woman
along with her husband PEDRO and their THREE BABIES The

CANDLE burns brightly nearby

ABUELA ALMA (INTO VO)
Long ago when my three babies had
just been born your Abuelo Pedro
and I were forced to flee our home

Strong light grows outside Young Alma and Pedro’s window
Alma and Pedro look concerned

Match to Young Alma and Pedro (holding the candle) leading a
frightened group of displaced people They struggle across a
beautiful RIVER

ABUELA ALMA (VO)

And though many joined us hoping
to find a new home we could not
escape the dangers and your
Abuelo was lost

The candle flickers and Pedro looks back from where they
came troubled Pedro hands Abuela the candle as he throws
his arms out protectively as marauders approach As they
advance Pedro vanishes into the wind in front of Abuela who
collapses and we push in on the CANDLE
ENCANTO 2

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
But in our darkest moment we
were given a miracle

As Abuela cries we burst out of our impressionistic history
into the SPLENDOR of a MIRACLE rooted deeply in MAGICAL
REALISM The CANDLE blossoms with a magical intensity
banishing the darkness

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
The candle became a magical flame
that could never go out and it
blessed us with a refuge in which
to live A place of wonder

YOUNG MIRABEL (VO)
An Encanto

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
An Encanto

Around Abuela and her babies (and displaced people)
MOUNTAINS rise forming a protected VALLEY The CANDLE shines
brightly enveloping ABUELA ALMA its magic glows from the
earth and a HOUSE grows around her

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
The miracle grew and our house
our casita itself came alive to
shelter us

The House COMES TO LIFE to the delight of the babies

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
When my children came of age the
miracle blessed each with a magic
gift to help us And when their
children came of age

The triplets turn five and as they STEP TOWARD GLOWING DOORS
they too are filled with MAGIC As they “grow-up” a new
generation is born and as these children are filled with
magic the series of doors becomes a mural-like family tree

YOUNG MIRABEL (VO)
They got magic too

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
That’s right and together our
family’s gifts have made our new
home a paradise

The wilderness transforms into paradise the House and MAGIC
CANDLE shining like a beacon We push in and match to
ENCANTO 3

INT CASA MADRIGAL - NURSERY - EVENING

The MAGIC CANDLE which we pull back from to find Young
Mirabel staring in awe Abuela smiles at her full of love

ABUELA ALMA
Tonight this candle will give you
your gift mi vida Strengthen our
community strengthen our home
Make your family proud

YOUNG MIRABEL
(solemn nodding)
Make my family proud

Mirabel nods solemn but bursting with pride Abuela beams
As fireworks explode the magical House knocks a CLOCK toward
them nudging that it’s time to start the ceremony

ABUELA ALMA
Yes yes Casita we’re going

The House brings Mirabel her shoes She giggles then helps
Abuela to the door holding her hand excited and nervous

YOUNG MIRABEL
What do you think my gift will be

Abuela Alma bends down to Mirabel full of love and pride

ABUELA ALMA
You are a wonder Mirabel Madrigal
Whatever gift awaits will be just
as special as you

On Mirabel’s face we match to her standing in the courtyard
as the curtain opens on her GIFT CEREMONY As Mirabel stares
at her undulating door full of wonder its glittering magic
blooms brighter and brighter and we transition to our title

ENCANTO

INT MIRABEL’S BEDROOM - DAWN
A PERCUSSION INTRO IS ALREADY REVVING UP

DISSOLVE FROM BRIGHT LIGHT TO MIRABEL’S GREEN GLASSES The
SHELF the glasses sit on lifts to one side (by the House) and
the glasses slide off into the waiting HAND of MIRABEL
who passes already “on a mission”
ENCANTO 4

Mirabel is now 15 though we don’t yet see her face As she
hurries around her room in tight shots the HOUSE tries to

keep up We see some of Mirabel’s personalized decorations
self-painted wallpaper family picture books etc

Mirabel grabs a “self-decorated” dress off a sewing table
Mirabel jumps and as she lands the House scrambles to put
SHOES under her feet Barely made it Mirabel puts her hand
on the DOORKNOB and we see her face for the first time as
she takes a breath like she’s heading into battle

MIRABEL
Make your family proud

INT CASA MADRIGAL - VARIOUS INTERIORS

The House conveys Mirabel downstairs and she passes a
portrait of ABUELO PEDRO

MIRABEL

As Mirabel moves through the corridors shutters open around
her She reaches the dining room and begins setting the

highlighting their gift As Mirabel sets the table kids

END SONG

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - FRONT YARD - LATE AFTERNOON

The song abruptly ends as Mirabel looks over to see ABUELA
in the doorway of the House Mirabel winces

ABUELA ALMA
What are you doing

MIRABEL
(nothing to see here)
Uh they were just asking about the
family and --
ENCANTO 12

LITTLE ALEJANDRA
She was about to tell us about her
super awesome gift

Abuela looks confused but DOLORES pops up out of nowhere

DOLORES
Oh Mirabel didn’t get one

Dolores thinking she was helpful and heads off Mirabel
busted looks back to Abuela who moves on The kids look
back to Mirabel feeling like they’ve been duped

INNOCENT CECILIA
You didn’t get a gift

Mirabel opens her mouth to try to spin this bad news but-- a
guy approaches with a DONKEY laden with supplies

DONKEY DELIVERY GUY
Mirabel Delivery I gave you the
“special” since you’re the only
Madrigal kid with no gift I call
it the “not special” special Since
uh since you have no gift

Crickets The kids just stare at Mirabel A beat

MIRABEL

DONKEY DELIVERY GUY
Ooo and tell Antonio good luck
Last gift ceremony was a bummer
(LEAVES RETURNS) Last one being
yours that did not work

He leaves Innocent Cecilia looks at Mirabel

INNOCENT CECILIA
If I was you Id be really sad

MIRABEL
Well my little friend I am not
because the truth is gift or no
gift I am just as special as the
rest of my family

All around Mirabel her amazing family does amazing things
The kids look at her like she’s delusional

ISABELA
Who wants more pink
ENCANTO 13

LUISA
Alright guys where do I drop the
wagon

INNOCENT CECILIA
Maybe your gift is being in denial

Mirabel thinks about that as more flowers bloom and a rainbow
appears over the house

PEPA (0S)
I made a rainbow

EXTINT CASA MADRIGAL ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel (carrying WAY too much) enters the COURTYARD where
preparations for Antonio’s gift ceremony is in full swing
flowers everywhere the House is creating stairs moving
furniture She nearly knocks into passing musicians

MIRABEL
Oh sorry excuse me

ABUELA (0S)
Lift it higher higher

CAMILO watching from the balcony above praises people

CAMILO
Hey nice job over there yeah yeah

ABUELA ALMA

Camilo changes into a tall guy to help hang an “ANTONIO”
BANNER over a DOOR WITH A GLOWING BORDER AROUND IT

CAMILO
(changing shape)
Jooooosé

ABUELA ALMA (0S)
Luisa the piano goes upstairs

LUISA
I’m on it
(nearly runs over Mirabel)
Careful sis

Mirabel tries to balance the groceries as the wind picks up
Pepa is creating a TORNADO as she nervously paces
ENCANTO 14

PEPA
My baby’s night has to be perfect
and it’s not perfect and people are
going to be coming and nothing’s
ready the whole town will be here -

FELIX
Pepi Pepi Pepita - you’re
tornadoing the flowers - the
flowers

ISABELA (0S)
Did someone say “flowers”

Isabela descends above Mirabel on a flowering vine and
flowers bloom all around her like a goddamn angel

FELIX
Our angel our angel

ISABELA
(cloying)
Please don’t clap

PEPA
Thank you

ISABELA
Oh it’s nothing

Isabela lands next to Mirabel but doesn’t see her as she

turns and bumps into her covering both in flowers As they
walk side-by-side we can feel their friction Mirabel tries
to get the petals off of her Isabela makes herself perfect

ISABELA (CONTD)
Uch a little sisterly advice if
you weren’t always trying too hard
you wouldn’t be in the way

MIRABEL
Actually Isa this is called
(LUGGING BASKET) helping and I’m
not in the way you ar--oof--

Mirabel collides with a post Isabela rolls her eyes

INT CASA MADRIGAL - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

As Mirabel hefts a TON of supplies onto the kitchen counter
Julieta notices Mirabel is clearly overcompensating
Concerned but trying not to show it Julieta sidles over
ENCANTO 15

JULIETA
Whoa Mi vida you okay You don’t
have to over-do it

MIRABEL
I know Mama I just want to do my
part like the rest of the family

Mirabel lifts a HEAVY OBJECT on the counter the House
shuffles it away revealing -- AGUSTIN his nose is covered
in gross welts that are impossible not to stare at

AGUSTIN
She’s right Amor --

MIRABEL
Eee--—

AGUSTIN

First gift ceremony since yours
lot of emotions - and I’ve been
there --

MIRABEL
(to Julieta)
Bee stings

JULIETA
Ay Agustin

Julieta sighs and starts working on a cure

AGUSTIN
-- when me and your Tio Félix
married into the family - outsiders
who had no gift never ever would
surrounded by the exceptional it
was easy to feel “un-ceptional”--

MIRABEL
-- okay Papi --

AGUSTIN
-- I’m just saying I get it--

Julieta jams an AREPA in Agustin’s mouth healing him and
shoves him away

JULIETA
(to Agustin)
Eat
(to Mirabel)
Mi amor if you ever want to talk --
ENCANTO 16

MIRABEL
Igotta put out the stuff the
house isn’t gonna decorate itself -
(off the “offended house”)
Sorry you could You look great

The House raises its decorations back up As Mirabel leaves
with a bunch of stuff Julieta looks on

JULIETA AGUSTIN
(calling) (horning in on the
Corazon remember you have advice)
nothing to prove Yeah remember nothing to
prove

Agustin gives Julieta a look like “we nailed it” He sees
that Julieta looks concerned and matches her concerned face

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - UPPER BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel arranges a bunch of candles around the second floor
she is really working hard

BACKGROUND WALLA (0S)
You guys can set up over here
Clean your rooms I don’t care how
big they are Anybody seen my
tiple

As Mirabel lights the candles she pulls out a DECORATION FOR
ABUELA that she’s worked extra hard on Next to Mirabel
are pictures of her extraordinary family She’s not on
that wall Mirabel stares at it for just a beat

ABUELA ALMA (0S)
One hour

Mirabel startles and drops the candle which ignite the
candle doily she made for Abuela

MIRABEL
No no no --

As Mirabel tries to put it out
ABUELA ALMA (0S)
Maybe you should leave the

decorations to someone else

Mirabel peers up to see ABUELA watching Mirabel who
couldn’t look more incompetent as she stomps the fire
ENCANTO 17

MIRABEL
No I actually made these as a
surprise - for you-- (REALIZING
IT’S ON FIRE) ooo--

As Mirabel holds up the doily it smolders Abuela sighs

ABUELA ALMA
Mirabel I know you want to help
But tonight must go perfectly The
whole town relies on our family on
our gifts So the best way for
some of us to help is to step
aside let the rest of the family
do what they do best Okay

Abuela looks at Mirabel with a tight-lipped smile an awkward
beat Mirabel nods wanting to be a team player

MIRABEL
Mm-hmm

Abuela looks at Mirabel an awkward beat Before anyone can
say anything a gust of wind blows and Abuela leaves

ABUELA ALMA
(looks 0S calls off)
Pepa you have a cloud

PEPA
(overly emotional)
I know Mama but now I can’t find
Antonio What do you want from me

As Pepa literally “storms off” Abuela steps away too On her
own again Mirabel heads for her room but overhears her
mother talking to Abuela

JULIETA (0S)
Mama be nice to Mirabel okay You
know tonight will be hard for her

ABUELA ALMA (0S)

If the gift ceremony doesn’t go
well this time tonight will be
hard for us all

INT NURSERYMIRABEL’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mirabel plops down on her bed trying to shake off her
conversation with Abuela
ENCANTO 18

FELIX (0S)
Antonio

Not wanting to wallow Mirabel opens a drawer and pulls out a
wrapped package stenciled with designs the same style as her
dress Mirabel dangles it under the bed looking off toward
nothing in particular

MIRABEL
(seemingly to no one)
Everyone’s looking for you
(nothing)
This present will self-destruct if
you don’t take it in three two
one

TWO TINY HANDS pop out from under the bed grab the present
and disappear below Smiling Mirabel scootches under the bed
and joins ANTONIO Mirabel sees he’s anxious plays it
slow treats him like a cohort instead of a little kid

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Nervous

(off his nod)
You have nothing to worry about
Youre gonna get your gift and open
that door and it’s gonna be the
coolest ever I know it

Antonio thinks about this

ANTONIO
What if it doesn’t work

MIRABEL
Well in that impossible
scenario you’d stay in here in
the nursery with me Forever
And Id get you all to myself

Antonio looks at her he clearly loves her a lot

ANTONIO
I wish you could have a door

Mirabel considers this for a moment it clearly pains her but
she puts on a brave face for Antonio

MIRABEL
You know what You don’t have to
worry about me ‘cause I have an
amazing family and an amazing
house and an amazing you
(MORE )
ENCANTO 19

MIRABEL (CONTD)
And seeing you get your special

gift and your door that’s gonna
make me way more happy than
anything

She walks her fingers over to the present and pulls it close

MIRABEL (CONTD)
But alas I am going to miss having
the world’s best roomie

She gestures to the present Antonio opens it revealing a
HAND-KNITTED JAGUAR in the style of Mirabel’s dress

MIRABEL (CONTD)
I know you’re an animal guy And I
made this so when you move into
your cool new room you always have
something to snuggle with

The earnestness of the moment is gently cut as the House
moves its floorboards to draw their attention to the time

MIRABEL (CONTD)
(faux-serious )
Alright hombrecito you ready

Antonio nods ready Mirabel moves to leave but

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Sorry I gotta get one more
squeeze

Mirabel sneaks another hug but the House playfully pulls out
them out from under the bed

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Okay okay we’re going Ow

EXT ENCANTO - DUSK - ESTABLISHING

People sing and cheer lighting fireworks and holding candles
as they make their way toward CASA MADRIGAL Yes the last
ceremony didn’t go well but it’s been ten years and the TOWN
is putting their hopes on this night being a success

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - FRONT DOOR - SAME

As the crowds arrive at the House Luisa is the VALET taking
people’s donkeys and moving the donkeys to the “parking
area” CAMILO changes sizes so that he can look at each
person entering and shake hands with them face-to-face
ENCANTO 20

LUISA
Here yah go

CAMILO
Oye Osvaldo Hola Sefiora
Cecilia up top

The HOUSE takes people’s hats as they head through the
archway LUISA walks by with a platter of food as kids climb
on her ISABELA showers guests with flower petals Mariano
admires her from afar Antonio’s door catches the attention
of two kids They rush up the staircase which suddenly
becomes a slide The children laugh and run up it again

INT CASA MADRIGAL - FOYER - LATER

Mirabel walks Antonio to the foyer which is sort of “back
stage” from where his ceremony will begin Pepa Félix
Camilo and Dolores see Antonio and cheer

FELIX
There you are

PEPA
(tearing up)
Look at you all grown up --

As Pepa tears up a cloud forms and starts to rain

FELIX
Pepi you’re gonna get him all wet

Camilo transforms himself into a tiny version of Félix

CAMILO (AS FELIX)
You make-a your Papa proud

FELIX
I don’t sound like that

CAMILO (AS FELIX)
“T don’t sound like that”

Dolores tilts her head and listens to a sound we cannot hear

DOLORES
Abuela says it’s time

Pepa bends down to Antonio kisses him

PEPA
Well be waiting at your door
ENCANTO 21

FELIX
Okay okay vamo vamo vamo--

CAMILO (AS FELIX)
“Okay okay Vamo vamo vam-- --
(yanked away by Félix)
- alright I’m done

As Félix yanks Camilo out we focus on Mirabel watching
Antonio We can see Mirabel’s anxiety beginning to bubble
Drums play and we find Abuela standing in the courtyard
holding the MAGIC CANDLE She is anxious as well

ABUELA ALBA
Fifty years ago in our darkest
moment this candle blessed us with
a miracle

We find older members of the crowd nodding along Over this
we also find Mirabel listening the words triggering
memories of her own gift day

ABUELA ALMA
And the greatest honor of our
family has been to use our
blessings to serve this beloved
community Tonight we come
together once more as another steps
into the light to make us proud

The crowd cheers and the “curtains” open to reveal Antonio
He freezes too scared to move

The House encourages Antonio but he won’t budge Antonio
turns to Mirabel hand outstretched asking for help Mirabel
looks to Abuela whose rules for tonight are clear then back
to Antonio torn

MIRABEL
I can’t

ANTONIO
I need you

Antonio motions to Mirabel again Mirabel wonders if she can
do this if she has the strength to step out and face the
reminders of the worst night of her life Then as everyone
watches Mirabel steps out and takes Antonio’s hand SHE IS
GOING TO “WALK HIM DOWN THE AISLE”

MIRABEL
Come on Let’s get you to your
door
ENCANTO 22

The family the town and Abuela see Mirabel join Antonio We
clock Abuela looking anxious But Antonio holds Mirabel’s
hand tightly he needs her and they begin to walk

With every step it gets harder for Mirabel the memory of
walking to her own door still so fresh in her mind - we

intercut with moments of her ceremony as a five-year-old

Mirabel looks to the MAGIC CANDLE in Abuela’s hands As they
climb the stairs to Antonio’s glowing door every step is a
painful reminder We intercut with the moment Mirabel’s door
vanished This is the moment everyone’s expectations of
Mirabel changed when Abuela looked at her differently
when Mirabel looked at herself differently

But Mirabel pushes through the pain of those memories and
helps Antonio reach his door handing him off to Abuela

ABUELA ALMA
Will you use your gift to honor our
miracle Will you serve this
community and strengthen our home

Antonio nods and Alma gestures to the door Will it work
Mirabel sees Antonio worry for just a moment but then as
he touches the doorknob he is FILLED WITH MAGIC And a
TOUCAN lands on Antonio’s arm and chirps Like it’s SAYING
something to him Antonio smiles delighted

ANTONIO
(happily surprised)

Uh-huh uh-huh I understand you
(off the toucan’s squawked
response)

Of course they can come

And then DOZENS OF ANIMALSBIRDS flock to him and his door
FORMS INTO AN ANIMAL MENAGERIE HE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH
ANIMALS Abuela is overjoyed and hugely relieved

ABUELA ALMA
WE HAVE A NEW GIFT

People cheer and fireworks go off and

INT ANTONIO’S ROOM -— CONTINUOUS

Antonio’s new magical room opens to reveal an enormous
CHOCO RAINFOREST Animals race through the crowd We see the
three kids from the opening enter

LITTLE ALEJANDRA
It’s bigger on the inside
ENCANTO 23

But as the kids gawk ROOAR A JAGUAR races past and to
Antonio’s delight the jaguar scoops him up onto his back and
races through the room - every kid’s dream come true

FELIX
WEPA ANTONIO Vaya vaya

As the jaguars picks up speed it playfully roars at Antonio

ANTONIO
You wanna go where

The Jaguar races UP a tree trunk tossing Antonio in the air

ANTONIO (CONTD)
Wooooaaah

He bounces across hammocks of COATIS and skates on the
surface of a RIVER using a SNAKE as a rope having the time
of his life Everyone watches as this introverted kid hollers
with delight

ANTONIO (CONTD)
Woooo-hoooo

The jaguar and Antonio stop near the family Félix celebrates
and the Jaguar leaps onto Agustin nearly knocking him over

Mirabel watches relieved for Antonio but the moment turns
as Abuela hurries over to Antonio proud and relieved and

pulls him in for a hug her eyes full of pride

ABUELA ALMA
I knew you could do it a gift
just as special as you

The words pierce Mirabel’s heart avoiding her feelings is
no longer possible She’s so alone and unworthy
watching her family she feels she is not truly a part of

ABUELA ALMA (CONTD)
We need a picture Everyone come
come come come come It’s a
great night it’s a perfect night
Everyone together

FAMILY EVERYONE
LA FAMILIA MADRIGAL

As everyone cheers POOF The brilliant light of a
magnesium flash sends us into SUPER SLOW MOTION As we
capture the family’s celebration we push toward Mirabel
who watches in the shadows from the side trying to keep it
together and failing
ENCANTO 24

MIRABEL
(singing)
DON’T BE UPSET OR MAD AT ALL
PARTY GOERS STREAM PAST MIRABEL IN SLOW-MO

MIRABEL (CONTD)
DON’T FEEL REGRET OR SAD AT ALL

THE FAMILY CIRCLES AROUND ABUELA

MIRABEL (CONTD)
HEY I’M STILL A PART OF THE FAMILY
MADRIGAL

MIRABEL TRIES TO TAKE A STEP TOWARD THE FAMILY

MIRABEL (CONTD)
AND I’M FINE I AM TOTALLY FINE
I WILL STAND ON THE SIDE AS YOU
SHINE

Mirabel stands trying to be strong singing to her family
but

MIRABEL (CONTD)
IM NOT FINE IM NOT FINE

As Mirabel faces her reality she finally tells us how she
really feels

MIRABEL (CONTD)
(singing)
I CAN’T MOVE THE MOUNTAINS
I CAN’T MAKE THE FLOWERS BLOOM
I CAN’T TAKE ANOTHER NIGHT
UP IN MY ROOM

WAITING ON A MIRACLE

MIRABEI

I CANT HEAL WHAT

L (CONTD)
’S BROKEN

CANT CONTROL THE MORNING RAIN OR A

HURRICANE
CANT KEEP DOWN 1
INVISIBLE PAIN

THE UNSPOKEN

ALWAYS WAITING ON A MIRACLE A

MIRACLE

Mirabel leaves Antonio’s room and starts walking down a
hallway Everything is still in slow-mo Mirabel walks past
magic doors
ENCANTO 25

MIRABEL (CONTD)
ALWAYS WALKING ALONE
ALWAYS WANTING FOR MORE
LIKE I’M STILL AT THAT DOOR
LONGING TO SHINE LIKE ALL OF YOU
SHINE

Mirabel sings in front of Abuela’s door It transforms into
Abuela holding the candle

MIRABEL (CONTD)
ALL I NEED IS A CHANGE
ALL I NEED IS A CHANCE
ALL I KNOW IS I CAN’T STAY ON THE
SIDE
OPEN YOUR EYES
OPEN YOUR EYES
OPEN YOUR EYES

Recreations of her family’s gifts begin to rise

MIRABEL (CONTD)
I WOULD MOVE THE MOUNTAINS
MAKE NEW TREES AND FLOWERS GROW
SOMEONE PLEASE JUST LET ME KNOW
WHERE DO I GO
I AM WAITING ON A MIRACLE
A MIRACLE

Mirabel sings as a House of light forms She opens the
glowing entrance doors back to the courtyard where the family
is standing excited to see her Welcoming her

MIRABEL (CONTD)
I WOULD HEAL WHATS BROKEN
SHOW THIS FAMILY SOMETHING NEW
WHO I AM INSIDE
SO WHAT CAN I DO
IM SICK OF WAITING ON A MIRACLE
HERE I GO

MIRABEL (CONTD)
I AM READY
CMON I’M READY
IVE BEEN PATIENT AND STEADFAST AND
STEADY
BLESS ME NOW AS YOU BLESSED US
ALL THOSE YEARS AGO
WHEN YOU GAVE US A MIRACLE

As this really rings out we find Mirabel in the courtyard
looking up at the candle Her reality returning she knows
her dream is a fantasy
ENCANTO 26

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Am I too late for a miracle

Mirabel stands in the lonely silence of the now empty
courtyard when CLANK - a ROOF TILE FALLS into the
courtyard next to her breaking

Curious Mirabel picks up the broken tile from the
courtyard as she inspects it she CUTS HER HAND on its
sharp broken edge

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Ow --

As she winces she notices something on the courtyard tiles
below her a tile MALFUNCTIONING fritzing in its place
Mirabel looks at it confused She reaches out her hand

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Casita

Mirabel reaches toward the fritzing tiles when CRACK A
small crack on the floor tiles begins to form What the hell
Mirabel recoils afraid CRACK CRACK The crack splinters
Growing Around Mirabel and the entire courtyard They
spread rippling everywhere Up the stairs

As the tiles keep fritzing Mirabel races after the growing
cracks which ripple past PEDRO’S PORTRAIT to the second
floor Mirabel loses the path for a moment but hears cracks
down the hall She looks just in time to see the cracks pass
ISABELA’S DOOR nearly extinguishing its magic

Mirabel moves faster following the disturbing cracks past
Luisa’s door Isabela’s door and continue toward
ABUELA’S DOOR and the MAGIC CANDLE

As the cracks swirl and multiply the candle grows dimmer and
dimmer Mirabel watches in horror it’s like the whole house
grows dark and as the cracks expand around Mirabel we push
in on her terrified expression and -- SMASH TO

INT ANTONIO’S RAINFOREST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
In Antonio’s room the party of all time is peaking On the
dance floor Pepa dances with Antonio and Félix who pulls
Abuela Alma up to dance and we see a glimmer of her fun side
FELIX
Come on Abuela Tirame un paso --

Wepa

But just as Abuela lets her guard down Mirabel bursts in
ENCANTO 27

MIRABEL
THE HOUSE IS IN DANGER THE HOUSE
IS IN DANGER

Everyone stops and looks at her the band stops their music
Abuela stares at Mirabel concerned

MIRABEL (CONTD)
(out of breath)
The tiles were falling and there
were cracks everywhere and the
candle almost went out

People in the party begin to murmur uncomfortably Abuela
clocks this and looks to Mirabel

ABUELA ALMA
Show me

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel leads the family to the candle and presents them
with nothing no cracks the candle shines brightly

MIRABEL
What No that’s --- the cracks
were there they were
everywhere The house was in
trouble the the candle was

Isabela looks at Mirabel and scoffs Abuela looks at the
candle then back to Mirabel embarrassed and disappointed

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Abuela I promise -

ABUELA ALMA
That’s enough

As nervous whispers build within the crowd Abuela gives a
pointed look to Mirabel then puts on her “face of
confidence” and turns to address the crowd

ABUELA ALMA (CONTD)
There is nothing wrong with La Casa
Madrigal The magic is strong
and so are the drinks Please --
music A bailar a bailar

Agustin realizing how awkward this is for Mirabel motions
to Luisa who brings him a PIANO which he plays to smooth-
over the weirdness Isabela looks at Mirabel and scoffs
ENCANTO 28

As people head back into the party Julieta approaches
Mirabel concerned

INT KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER
As sounds of the party continue Julieta prepares an AREPA

MIRABEL
If it was all in my head how did I
cut my hand I would never ruin
Antonio’s night Is that really
what you think

JULIETA
What I think is that today was very
hard for you-

MIRABEL

That’s (not)-

(then)
I was looking out for the family
And I might not be super-strong
like Luisa or effortlessly perfect
like “Sefiorita Perfecta” Isabela
who’s never even had a bad hair
day But (SIGHS) Whatever

The House delivers an arepa to Julieta who moves to Mirabel

JULIETA
I wish you could see yourself the
way I do You are perfect just
like this You’re just as special
as anyone else in this family

Mirabel hears the words but before they can land Julieta
holds Mirabel’s hand and heals her

MIRABEL
Mm-hm You just healed my hand with
an arepa con queso

JULIETA
I healed your hand
(playful)
-with my love for my daughter
with her wonderful brain--

Mirabel tries to wriggles away from Julieta’s affection

MIRABEL
Agh
ENCANTO 29

JULIETA
--big heart--

MIRABEL
Stop

JULIETA

--cool glasses--

MIRABEL
Mama

Julieta gives Mirabel a big embarrassing kiss on the cheek

JULIETA
Ay te amo cosa linda

But though Julieta tries to snuggle up to Mirabel Mirabel is
not won over and extricates herself

MIRABEL
I know what I saw

Julieta sighs

JULIETA
Mira my brother Bruno lost his way
in this family I don’t want the
same for you Get some sleep
Youll feel better tomorrow

Off Mirabel’s unresolved feelings we jump to

INT MIRABEL’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Mirabel stares at the ceiling - there’s NO WAY she’s
sleeping And there’s no way she made it all up

- QUICK FLASH REMEMBERING THE CRACKS THE DIMMING CANDLE

Frustrated Mirabel climbs out of bed opens her door and
looks up to the candle where the wall was covered in cracks

EXT ABUELA’S WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel rubs her hand along the stucco wall of Abuela’s
window no cracks but as she stares confused she
hears a noise it’s ABUELA She’s upset vulnerable
Mirabel’s never seen her like this Abuela steps to the
window and opens her chatelaine to a portrait of Pedro
ENCANTO 30

ABUELA ALMA

Ay Pedro I need you Cracks in
our casita If our family knew
how vulnerable we truly are if

our miracle is dying We cannot
lose our home again

Tears are welling up in Abuela’s eyes now

ABUELA ALMA (CONTD)
Why is this happening

(then)
Open my eyes If the answer is
here help me find it Help me
protect our family Help me save
our miracle

Abuela turns and heads back into her room

We push in on Mirabel if there was any doubt that she needed
to act it’s gone The cracks were real she’s not crazy she
needs to help Abuela she needs to save the magic save the
family Mirabel stares at the candle

MIRABEL
I will save the miracle

INT MIRABEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

SMASH Mirabel busts into her room grabs her dress grabs
her bag puts on her shoes Energized she goes to her door
grabs the handle the music builds bigger and bigger and
RECORD SCRATCH

MIRABEL
(to the House)
Wait How do I save a miracle

The House pantomimes back it has no idea Mirabel thinks for
a moment

MIRABEL (CONTD)
(lightbulb)
I figure out what’s happening to
the miracle (OFF THE HOUSE) Oh I
have no idea but there is one
person in this family who hears
everything about everything

Mirabel looks at a picture of her family and zeroes in on
DOLORES her cousin who hears everything
ENCANTO 31

EXT OUTSIDE PATIO - MORNING

MIRABEL (VO)
-so if anyone would know what’s
wrong with the magic it’s her

Several AREPAS are picked up by DOLORES who is stacking
her plate with food She looks oddly nervous Behind her
Mirabel enters and locks on target

MIRABEL

(like it’s not weird)
Dolores hey You know out of all
my older cousins you’re like my
favorite cousin so I feel like I
can talk to you about anything
ergo you can talk to me about
anything like the problem with the
magic last night that no one seemed
to worry about but maybe you heard
about that maybe I should know
about

Behind them is FELIX who stands with THE REAL DOLORES
FELIX
Camilo Stop pretending you’re

Dolores so you can have seconds

The “DOLORES” near Mirabel morphs back into “Camilo” The
House takes his food back and whacks his hand

CAMILO
Worth a shot Ah Ey

The REAL DOLORES whispers in Mirabel’s ear

DOLORES
The only one worried about the
magic is you and the rats

talking in the walls(BIZARRE A
BEAT) oh and Luisa I heard her
eye twitching all night

A lightbulb goes off in Mirabel’s head She looks over at
Luisa who is carrying a table over with one hand

LUISA
There we go

But as Mirabel heads for Luisa Abuela Alma enters
ENCANTO 32

ABUELA ALMA
(agitated)
Everyone to the table Let’s go
let’s go --

Mirabel takes Pepa’s seat so that she can sit next to Luisa

MIRABEL
Luisa--

ABUELA ALMA
Family we are all thankful for
Antonio’s wonderful new gift

Abuela goes to her chair but finds COATIS in it

ANTONIO
I told ‘em to warm up your seat

Antonio smiles to Abuela who manages a smile back

ABUELA ALMA
Thank you Tofiito I’m sure today
well find a way to put your
blessings to good use
(trailing off 0S)
»aS must we all we are the
caretakers of this Encanto

As Abuela continues Mirabel leans over to Luisa

MIRABEL
Luisa Dolores says you’re totally
freaking out any chance you maybe
know something about last night
with the magic -
(off Luisa)
You do

Mirabel pounds the table excited

ABUELA ALMA (0S)
Mirabel

Mirabel looks up busted by Abuela for talking while Abuela
was giving a speech

ABUELA ALMA (CONTD)
If you can’t pay attention I will
help you

MIRABEL
Actually I--
ENCANTO 33

ABUELA ALMA
Casita

The House MOVES Mirabel next to Abuela away from Luisa

ABUELA ALMA (CONTD)

As I was saying we must never take
our miracle for granted so today
we will work twice as hard

MIRABEL
(trying to go to Luisa)
Mhmm I will help Luisa --

Mirabel stands to go back to Luisa but Abuela continues

ABUELA ALMA
Stop First an announcement I’ve
spoken to the Guzmans about
Mariano’s proposal to Isabela
Dolores do we have a date

DOLORES
(listens “to town”)
Tonight (LISTENS) He wants five
babies

Isabela nervously sprouts some flowers

ABUELA ALMA
Wonderful such a fine young man
with our perfect Isabela (PLUCKS
OUT WRONG FLOWERS) will bring a new
generation of magical blessings and
make both of our families stronger

Camilo morphs into a snarky version of MARIANO Isabela swats
him with flowers to get him to stop

CAMILO
(as Mariano)
Mmmm (Makes kissy sounds) Ay

ABUELA ALMA
Okay our community is counting on
us La familia Madrigal

MIRABEL FAMILY
-- La Familia Madrigal

MIRABEL
Luisa hey --
ENCANTO 34

As everyone gets up Mirabel sees Luisa is gone Mirabel
heads after Luisa and -- SMACKS into Isabela sending petals
everywhere

ISABELA
(calling after)
What is your problem

MIRABEL (0S)
(calling back)
Ugh sorry - (OS impact) - Hey
Luisa Hold up
EXT ENCANTO - TOWN - A LITTLE LATER

We find Luisa MOVING A CHURCH The Priest “blesses her”

SRA OSMA

Luisa can you re-route the river
LUISA

Will do
SR RENDON

Luisa the donkeys got out again

LUISA
On it

As Luisa picks up a COUPLE OF DONKEYS Mirabel awkwardly
climbs over the stone wall behind her

MIRABEL
(calling after)
Luisa wait a second --

Luisa looks back sees Mirabel moves faster

MIRABEL (CONTD)
You gotta tell me about the magic
What’s going on What are you
hiding

LUISA
Nothing just gotta lotta chores
so maybe you should just go home

SR FLORES
Luisa my house is leaning to the--
oh

Luisa knocks a crooked house straight and keeps walking
ENCANTO 35

MIRABEL
Dolores said your eye was twitching
and it never twitches something’s
making you nervous --

LUISA
Hey move you’re gonna make me drop
a donkey

MIRABEL
Luisa Will you just-- Just tell
me what it is

LUISA
There’s nothing to tell --

MIRABEL
Youre obviously worried about
something Luisa if you know
what’s hurting the magic and it
gets worse ‘cause you won’t tell me
what’s wrong --

LUISA
NOTHING’S WRONG

The DONKEYS are like “YIKES” Mirabel’s like “whoa” Luisa
realizes tries to play it off

LUISA (CONTD)
Wow uh sorry that uh that
snuck out there what I meant
was “why would anything be
wrong” I’m totally fine The
magic’s fine Luisa’s fine I’m
totally not nervous

As Luisa smiles trying to be casual her eye twitches

MIRABEL
Your eye is doing the thing

Unwilling to admit there’s a problem Luisa gets in Mirabel’s
face

LUISA
(singing)
I’M THE STRONG ONE I’M NOT
NERVOUS
I’M AS TOUGH AS THE CRUST OF THE
EARTH IS

Luisa smashes a boulder to underscore her toughness A beat
Mirabel stares at Luisa what the hell is happening
ENCANTO 36

MIRABEL
Okay

LUISA
I MOVE MOUNTAINS I MOVE CHURCHES
AND I GLOW CUZ I KNOW WHAT MY
WORTH IS

Another little beat The donkeys behind Mirabel back up

MIRABEL
Course I mean -- (TO DONKEYS) hey
where are you going

Luisa approaches Mirabel intense

LUISA

I DON’T ASK HOW HARD THE WORK IS
GOT A ROUGH INDESTRUCTIBLE
SURFACE

(gaining momentum )
DIAMONDS and PLATINUM I FIND ‘EM I
FLATTEN ‘EM I TAKE WHAT I’M
HANDED I BREAK WHAT’S DEMANDED
BUT

Luisa rips up the ground sending them both into a fantasy
song space where Luisa’s insecurities are on full display

LUISA (CONTD)
UNDER THE SURFACE
I FEEL BERSERK AS A TIGHTROPE
WALKER IN A THREE RING CIRCUS
UNDER THE SURFACE
WAS HERCULES EVER LIKE “YO I DON’T
WANNA FIGHT CERBERUS”

Mirabel suddenly finds herself battling Cerberus only to be
saved by Luisa

LUISA (CONTD)
UNDER THE SURFACE
IM PRETTY SURE IM
WORTHLESS
IF I CANT BE OF SERVICE
A FLAW OR A CRACK
THE STRAW IN THE STACK
THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL’S BACK
WHAT BREAKS THE CAMEL’S BACK
IT’S

Were suddenly on a stage where Luisa shows her vulnerable
side as donkeys cascade all around them
ENCANTO 37

LUISA (CONTD)
PRESSURE LIKE A DRIP DRIP DRIP
THATLL NEVER STOP WHOA
PRESSURE THATLL TIP TIP TIP TIL

LUISA (CONTD)
GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER YOUR
SISTERS OLDER

Suddenly they fall into a GIANT COFFEE BEAN PRESS

LUISA (CONTD)
PRESSURE LIKE A GRIP GRIP GRIP AND
IT WONT LET GO WHOA
PRESSURE LIKE A TICK TICK TICK TIL
IT’S READY TO BLOW WHOA

Luisa helps Mirabel escape the coffee bean press only to
find themselves in a field of geysers

LUISA (CONTD)
GIVE IT TO YOUR SISTER YOUR
SISTERS STRONGER
SEE IF SHE CAN HANG ON A LITTLE
LONGER
WHO AM I IF I CAN’T CARRY IT ALL
IF I FALTER

Another jump on they are hanging off of a cliff

LUISA (CONTD)
UNDER THE SURFACE
I HIDE MY NERVES AND IT WORSENS I
WORRY SOMETHING IS GONNA HURT US
UNDER THE SURFACE
THE SHIP DOESNT SWERVE HAS IT
HEARD HOW BIG THE ICEBERG IS

The mountains part and we are suddenly on the deck of the
Titanic as an iceberg looms

LUISA (CONTD)
UNDER THE SURFACE
I THINK ABOUT MY PURPOSE CAN I
SOMEHOW PRESERVE THIS
LINE UP THE DOMINOES
A LIGHT WIND BLOWS
(MORE)
ENCANTO 38

LUISA (CONTD)
YOU TRY TO STOP IT TOPPLIN’ BUT ON
AND ON IT GOES

Luisa and Mirabel are sucked up into a tornado sending them
into a beautiful sky with pink clouds and not a care in the
world As Mirabel listens she gains a whole new appreciation
of what Luisa has been feeling all of these years

LUISA (CONTD)

BUT WAIT IF I COULD SHAKE
THE CRUSHING WEIGH
OF EXPECTATION WOULD THAT FREE SOME
ROOM UP FOR JOY
OR RELAXATION OR SIMPLE PLEASURE
INSTEAD WE MEASURE

THIS GROWING PRESSURE

KEEPS GROWING KEEP GOING

CUZ ALL WE KNOW IS

H

Just as Luisa lets herself relax giant boulders fall from
the sky and Luisa catches them before they crush Mirabel

LUISA (CONTD)
PRESSURE LIKE A DRIP DRIP DRIP
THAT’LL NEVER STOP WHOA
PRESSURE THATLL TIP TIP TIP TIL
YOU JUST GO POP WHOA

LUISA (CONTD)

THE ENTIRE MADRIGAL HOUSE LANDS ON LUISA CRUSHING HER
Mirabel can’t believe it but suddenly Luisa lifts the
house up from below She’s not giving in

LUISA (CONTD)
NO MISTAKES

PRESSURE LIKE A GRIP GRIP GRIP AND
IT WONT LET GO WHOA
PRESSURE LIKE A TICK TICK TICK TIL
IT’S READY TO BLOW WHOA

LUISA (CONTD)

(MORE)
ENCANTO 39

LUISA (CONTD)
WHO AM I IF I DON’T HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES
(THEN)
NO CRACKS NO BREAKS
NO MISTAKES
NO PRESSURE

BOOM The song ends Mirabel looks at Luisa stunned Luisa
stares back like a dancer who just finished an insane routine
and still breathing heavy

BACK TO REALITY

They stand in a weird silence And instead of saying
anything Mirabel simply HUGS LUISA

MIRABEL
I think you’re carrying way too
(GETS SQUEEZED) much

Emotional Luisa picks Mirabel up and hugs her too hard

LUISA
Maybe I over do it

MIRABEL
(getting squeezed)
Yup

LUISA
Um there is something you should
know last night when you saw the
cracks I felt weak

Luisa finally lets Mirabel breathe

MIRABEL
Wha- What what what

SR RENDON (0S)
Luisa the donkeys

LUISA
On it

MIRABEL
Wait wait wait - what do you
mean What do you think’s hurting
the magic

Luisa picks up a donkey she has to hurry she pulls Mirabel
close to tell her a secret
ENCANTO 40

LUISA
Don’t know But I heard the grown
ups once before Tio Bruno left he
had like some terrible vision about
it

MIRABEL
Tio Bruno What was in his vision

LUISA
No one knows they never found it
But if something’s wrong with the
magic start with Bruno’s tower
find that vision

Luisa heads off carrying more donkeys

MIRABEL
(calling after)
Wait how do you “find” a vision
What am I even looking for

LUISA
If you find it you’ll know But be

careful that place is off limits
for a reason

Mirabel turns back to the House to Bruno’s tower

INT CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - A LITTLE LATER

On her way to Bruno’s door she sneaks past Isabela and
Abuela Alma

ABUELA ALMA
Such a perfect match

ISABELA
So perfect

ABUELA ALMA
And so good for the Encanto

Mirabel sneaks past the two and reaches Bruno’s door No
one’s been in there for years

INT BRUNO’S TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel shoves open Bruno’s door revealing a dusty dark

ante room In front of her sand spills in from above
creating a curtain of sand beyond which she can’t see
ENCANTO 41

MIRABEL
Casita can you turn off the sand

Nothing happens Mirabel looks back where she can see the
floor tiles at the doorjamb say “the house cannot help beyond
this point” The gravity of this hits Mirabel

MIRABEL (CONTD)
You can’t help in here

The House responds “no and I’m worried about you” after
all Mirabel has never been “without the House”

MIRABEL (CONTD)
I’1l be fine I need to do this
for you for Abuela maybe a
little for me
(looks to sand)
Find the vision save the mir-ack

As Mirabel steps through the “sandfall” shefalls

INT BRUNO’S TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Mirabel falls face first and slides down a giant sand dune
She looks up to see she’s in towering room

MIRABEL
Whoa

Widen to reveal a SIGN reading “Your Future Awaits” which

points to the TOP of the cavern HUNDREDS OF STAIRS lead all
the way up As Mirabel looks up - FLIT-FLIT-FLIT Antonio’s
TOUCAN flaps down next to her It smiles and squawks “hello”

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Oh hello (THEN) Lotta stairs but
at least Ill have a friend-- (the
toucan flies away) no you flew
away immediately

Mirabel watches it fly to the top She’s on her own Mirabel
grits her teeth and starts climbing

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Alright

As she goes we pop forward in time and with each little
pop she gets more tired and is soon wheezing and struggling

MIRABEL (CONTD)
(talk-singing)
Welcome to the Family Madrigal
(MORE)
ENCANTO 42

MIRABEL (CONTD)
(NEXT POP)there’s so many stairs
in the Casa Madrigal (NEXT POP)
you would think there’d be another
way to get so high cause we’re
magic but no -- magical how many
stairs fit in here Bruno your
room is the worst

Later Mirabel finally gets to the top of the stairs only to
find there is a gap in the path She groans exhausted

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Come on

As Mirabel takes a breath then removes a rope railing on
and throws it over a boulder above as an anchor

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Okay I can do this (looking at
the gap) Ooo

Mirabel goes to swing across slips loses her balance
but somehow makes it across Stunned she succeeded
Mirabel pumps her fists --

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Wooooo

But as Mirabel stomps her foot to celebrate the ledge below
her cracks and plummets to the ground nearly taking her with
it She looks to the toucan who looks at her judgmental
Deciding celebration time is over Mirabel turns to the
entrance of Bruno’s “temple”

INT BRUNO’S TEMPLE - MOMENTS LATER

The corridors feel like a forgotten tomb The TOUCAN trails
her nervous Mirabel looks around focussing on a triptych
of images depicting how Bruno’s visions come to pass As
Mirabel investigates it - SCREEE She accidentally knocks a
POT full of RATS They startle Mirabel and scurry into a
RELIEF SCULPTURE OF BRUNO On closer inspection Bruno’s
eyes have been scratched out Disturbing

Mirabel hears a creak which draws her eyes to Bruno’s
“INNER SANCTUM” It sure looks like the epicenter The TOUCAN
looks at Mirabel turns around and flies away

MIRABEL (0S)
Quitter
ENCANTO 43

INT BRUNO’S INNER SANCTUM - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel enters the dark room there’s an unusual circle of
SAND in the middle but there is no sign of anything else
It’s a dead end Confused she steps out onto the SAND

MIRABEL
Empty

The wind moving through the cavern sucks the door shut
plunging Mirabel into DARKNESS Mirabel panics stuck in the

darkness but then a light Something glowing green
she’s standing on it the sand itself seems to be
glowing Mirabel digs into the sand and finds A GLOWING

SHARD - LIKE A PIECE OF AN EMERALD RELIEF SCULPTURE
MIRABEL (CONTD)
(whispered to herself)
What’s hurting the magic

INT CASA MADRIGAL - FOYER - SAME TIME
Abuela sweeps the House trying to clean up Isabela’s copious
flower petals But the room seems to rumble Concerned
Abuela looks up and sees the CANDLE flicker just a bit
INT BRUNO’S INNER SANCTUM - SAME TIME

As Mirabel pulls more glowing emerald pieces from the sand
she realizes they form some kind of image She realizes this

is Bruno’s vision smashed to pieces Mirabel nervously
connects the pieces to reveal HER OWN WORRIED FACE
MIRABEL
Me

RUMBLE The entire cavern begins to shake falling apart
Sand begins pouring in covering the remaining shards under
the sand Panicking Mirabel tries to dig out the remaining
shards and shove them into her MOCHILA bag as the cavern
quakes and CRACKS snake around the room

As pieces of stone and sand threaten to block the entrance
Mirabel races to collect one last piece but as she dives to
the door it’s locked Mirabel bangs at it desperately and
then jiggles the handle Whoosh A tidal wave of sand
pushes her out to safety almost sending her over the cliff
Mirabel looks down at the shards what does it mean
ENCANTO 44

INT CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - AFTERNOON

Mirabel hurries out of Bruno’s room and turns a corner and
walks right into ABUELA ALMA

ABUELA ALMA
Uch where are you coming from in
such a hurry

MIRABEL
I’m sorry I was --

ABUELA ALMA
(seeing bits of sand)
What’s in your hair

MIRABEL
(flustered)
Uh --

Is Mirabel busted Just as Abuela begins to look
suspicious CRYING INTERRUPTS THE MOMENT It’s the LOUD
SOBBING of LUISA who staggers up the stairs behind them

LUISA
My gift I’m losing my gift

ABUELA ALMA
What

LUISA
Mirabel and I were having this
little talk about me carrying too
much so I tried not to carry so
much but I realized it was putting
me behind and I knew I was gonna
let everyone down and felt really
bad so I was grabbing all the
donkeys but then when I went to
throw the donkeys in the barn they
were heavy

Luisa runs off crying Abuela looks to Mirabel concerned
ABUELA ALMA
What did you do What did you say

to her

MIRABEL
Nothing I - I don’t--

ABUELA ALMA
Mirabel --
ENCANTO 45

As they sit in an awkward silence -- BELLS from town ring
Abuela looks torn

ABUELA ALMA (CONTD)
Ach I have to go get the Guzmans
for Isabela’s engagement

(torn off Mirabel)

Stay away from Luisa until I can
talk to her Tonight we can’t have
any more problems And whatever
youre doing stop doing it

Abuela heads off Mirabel looks at Luisa’s door which
flickers ever so slightly

INT MIRABEL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Shaking Mirabel pulls out the shards of BRUNO’S VISION
trying to understand She looks at HER FACE staring back

MIRABEL
to herself)
Why am I in your vision Bruno

A FLASH of LIGHTNING and THUNDER shake the room Startled
Mirabel turns to see PEPA frazzled in her doorway

MIRABEL (CONTD)
hiding the shards)
Tia jeez --

PEPA
trying to shoo clouds)
Sorry sorry I- I didn’t mean to --
shoo shoo shoo -- I just wanted
to get the last of Tofiito’s things -
and then I heard “the name we do
not speak”
(a rumble of thunder
comedically dramatic)
Great now I’m thundering And a
thunder will lead to a drizzle and
a drizzle will lead to a sprinkle--
(to herself a mantra)
Clear skies clear skies clear
skies--

Pepa tries to calm herself as she picks up a few of Antonio’s
remaining clothes from the room sandals underwear etc
Mirabel looks at her looks at the bag of shards
ENCANTO

MIRABEL
Uh Tia Pepa - if Bru- if he had a
vision about “someone” what would
it mean for them

PEPA
We don’t talk about Bruno

MIRABEL
I know it’s just hypothetically
if he “saw” you --

PEPA
-- Mirabel please We need to get
ready for the Guzmans

MIRABEL
I just want to know if it was
generally positive or like

less positive or--

Félix barges in

FELIX
It was a nightmare

PEPA
Félix

FELIX
Ey she needs to know Pepi She

PEPA

FELIX
He would see something terrible

PEPA

MIRABEL

he saw

FELIX
Then you better figure it out
because it was coming for you

ENCANTO 47

PEPA
WE DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO NO NO NO

Pepa tries to get them to stop but looks at Félix who
motions for Pepa to spill it and suddenly we are BACK IN
THE PAST and witnessing the day of their wedding

PEPA (CONTD)
BUT IT WAS MY WEDDING DAY

FELIX
IT WAS OUR WEDDING DAY

PEPA
WE WERE GETTING READY AND THERE

into the air PEPA shoots FELIX a look
ENCANTO 48

PEPAFELIX
WE DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO NO NO NO

Mirabel gets pulled to the side by weird Dolores the cousin
who can hear everything and suddenly they are in the family
courtyard

DOLORES
HEY - GREW TO LIVE IN FEAR OF BRUNO
STUTTERING OR STUMBLING
I COULD ALWAYS HEAR HIM SORT OF
MUTTERING AND MUMBLING
I ASSOCIATE HIM WITH THE SOUND OF
FALLING SAND CH CH CH

Dolores twirls Mirabel around and she tries to keep up

DOLORES (CONTD)
IT’S A HEAVY LIFT WITH A GIFT SO
HUMBLING ALWAYS LEFT ABUELA AND
THE FAMILY FUMBLING GRAPPLING WITH
PROPHECIES THEY COULDNT
UNDERSTAND DO YOU UNDERSTAND

Mirabel gets pulled into a creepy underground space with
Camilo who shape-shifts to add a dramatic effect to his
extra creepy Bruno tale where he BECOMES Bruno himself

CAMILO

WHEN HE CALLS YOUR NAME

Mirabel emerges from the cavernous underground to find
herself in the town plaza surrounded by townsfolk who had
bad run-ins with Bruno

SRA OSMA

NEXT DAY DEAD
ENCANTO 49

OSVALDO OROZCO ORTIZ

ALL
YOUR FATE IS SEALED WHEN YOUR

And as the spotlight turns to ISABELA we find ourselves
back in the family courtyard waiting to hear Isabela’s
terrible story but instead she sings like a bird her

story as perfect as she is

ISABELA
HE TOLD ME THAT THE LIFE OF MY
DREAMS WOULD BE PROMISED AND
SOMEDAY BE MINE

Mirabel looks at Isabela like “really everyone has these
terrible visions but you have that one”

ISABELA (CONTD)
HE TOLD ME THAT MY POWER WOULD GROW
LIKE THE GRAPES THAT THRIVE ON THE
VINE

ABUELA ALMA

We whirl around Mirabel as she PASSES LUISA’S DOOR WHICH

STARTS TO FADE AND AS MIRABEL WATCHES IN TERROR LUISA SEEMS

TO BE LOSING HER STRENGTH

FAMILY

HE’S HERE

Mirabel hurries into her room and struggles to finish
assembling the vision which glows brighter and brighter

ALL

DON’T TALK ABOUT BRUNO

MTRABEL

WHY DID I TALK ABOUT BRUNO

ALL

NOT A WORD ABOUT BRUNO

MTRABEL

I NEVER SHOULDA BROUGHT UP BRUNO

SONG ENDS Mirabel stares at the completed VISION image which
shows MIRABEL in front of her cracked house

INT CASA MADRIGAL - MIRABEL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mirabel is horrified that the vision shows her face
surrounded by cracks but as she stares at it panicking

AGUSTIN (0S)
Miraboo Got your party pants on

‘cause I do--

Agustin stops as he pokes his head in and sees the vision He
looks to Mirabel concerned The HOUSE quickly and
ungracefully tries to cover it up Mirabel looks at Agustin
considers lying but realizes she should just spill it
ENCANTO 52

MIRABEL

(spilling out)
I broke into Bruno’s tower I
found his last vision the family’s
in trouble the magic is dying the
house is breaking Luisa’s gift is
fading and I think it’s all because
of me

Agustin stares at Mirabel stunned

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Pa

Agustin eyes go wider trying to formulate a plan Agustin
then shoves the vision into his POCKETS

AGUSTIN

(smiling but panicking)
We say nothing Abuela wants
tonight to be perfect ‘til the
Guzmans leave you did not break
into Bruno’s tower the magic is
not dying the house is not
breaking Luisa’s gift is not
fading no one will know just act
normal no one has to know

Suddenly there’s a NOISE and they turn to see DOLORES all
the way across the courtyard but her eyes tell us she has
clearly heard everything that Agustin just said

DOLORES
(whispered)
I know
MIRABEL

She’s gonna tell everyone
ABUELA ALMA (0S)
(sweetly but firm)
Time to eat
Agustin realizes they’re busted
AGUSTIN
Miércoles

INT CASA MADRIGAL - DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

The Madrigal family plus MARIANO and his ABUELA GUZMAN
(European Spanish judgmental) sit at the dining table
ENCANTO 53

ABUELA ALMA
The Guzmans and the Madrigals
together will be so good for the
Encanto

ABUELA GUZMAN
Yes then let’s hope tonight is not
a horrible disaster

ABUELA ALMA
(chuckles then toasts)
To a perfect night Salud

EVERYONE
Salud

Mirabel does her best to act normal as she maintains
unwavering eye contact with Dolores who struggles to keep
the secret in but looks like she’s gonna pop any minute

As the Abuelas lightly chuckle (there is fun light tension
between them) Mirabel keeps staring at Dolores willing her
not to divulge the secret

ABUELA GUZMAN (0S)
I assumed that all was well in La
Casa Madrigalthough when it
comes to my Mariano it is always

best to see for myself

A BOWL OF AVOCADO PASSES IN FRONT OF MIRABEL blocking her
view of Dolores

MARIANO (0S)
Avocado

As the avocados pass Mirabel now sees that Dolores couldn’t
hold out any longer and is now telling Camilo the secret - he
chokes on his food his head changes into Mirabel then Bruno
as he snarfs on the table

ABUELA GUZMAN (0S)
La Familia Madrigal has always been
a pillar of our community

Not great Everyone looks at him - especially the two Abuelas
(and Isabela) Abuela Alma doesn’t like this at all and pours
more wine for Abuela Guzman to distract her

FELIX
(not in front of company)
Camilo fix your face
ENCANTO 54

Camilo looks to Mirabel who is starting to panic that Camilo
now knows her secret too but as she tries to “stare him into
keeping quiet” a PITCHER of water PASSES IN FRONT OF HER

ISABELA (0S)
Water

As the water jug passes Mirabel sees that Camilo is now
whispering to Félix Félix’s eyes go wide and he chokes on
some water which flies onto Abuela Guzman’s plate

Abuela Alma watches this quietly panicking trying to
maintain her composure

ABUELA ALMA
(a little weirded-out)
Mirabel the cream please

Mirabel smiles at Abuela and turns to Agustin for the cream

MIRABEL
Pa the cream

Reveal Agustin next to Mirabel He tries to hand her the
cream but his hand is shaking like crazy Mirabel takes the
cream and passes it to Abuela

Thunder draws Mirabel’s attention to Pepa Félix is
whispering in her ear and now a small swirling hurricane
forms over the dining room table

ABUELA ALMA
(clearly embarrassed)
Pepa The cloud

Pepa tries her best to calm herself down to shrink the cloud

PEPA
Clear skies clear skies clear
skies

Julieta leans over to Pepa concerned Pepa whispers in
Julieta’s ear Julieta flushes then looks to Mirabel DEEPLY
WORRIED

Mirabel tries to avoid her mother’s gaze looking at the
floor to avoid eye-contact But as Mirabel looks down she
finds TINY CRACKS beginning to form on the FLOOR BELOW HER
AND ISABELA Are they sprouting from her

MARIANO (0S)
Mirabel
ENCANTO 55

Mirabel freaked out sits up fast bonking her head on the
underside of the table then pops up

MARIANO (CONTD)
everything okay

Mirabel stares at Mariano caught Then

AGUSTIN (0S)
Everything’s great she’s just
excited For you to propose which
you should do as fast as you can --

MIRABEL

Yes
MARIANO

Uh I was actually gonna
MIRABEL

You were actually gonna Great

Mirabel swivels Isabela’s chair toward Mariano Abuela Guzman
is a little weirded out

ABUELA GUZMAN
Well well -- wellsince
everyone here has a talent my
Mariano wanted to begin with a
song Luisa could you bring over
the piano

Luisa at the end of the table moans fighting tears She
sad marches to “get the piano” knowing she can’t lift it As
she goes Mirabel sees the cracks spreading

LUISA
(through tears)
Okay

MIRABEL
Uh it’s actually family tradition
to sing after

On “AFTER” Mirabel shoves Mariano down on one knee And
motions for him to begin

MARIANO
(Takes a breath)
Isabela most graceful of all the
Madrigals-—
ENCANTO 56

As the cracks spread the House starts to malfunction
Mirabel moves behind Mariano shielding the family from
seeing the cracks but now awkwardly horning in on the
proposal

MARIANO (CONTD)
Um

MIRABEL
You’re doing great

Under Agustin Mirabel sees the Coatis take the GLOWING
SHARDS of MIRABEL’S VISION OUT OF HIS POCKET

MARIANO (0S)
The most perfect flower in this
entire Encanto

Outside Luisa tries to shove a piano making horrible
scraping noises Abuela Guzman looks utterly confused

MIRABEL
No --

MARTANO
in this entire Encanto

The COATIS are almost done assembling the vision Mirabel
sees them and panics

MARIANO (CONTD)
WILL YOU MARRY ME

No longer able to contain herself Mirabel lunges at Coatis

MIRABEL
Nooo

Luisa falls to the ground CRYING in defeat Toucan is
frightened by Pepa’s storm cloud and goes flying over Abuela
Guzman’s head who ducks just in time

ABUELA GUZMAN
What is happening

DOLORES
(blurting)
Mirabel found Bruno’s vision she’s
in it she’s gonna destroy the
magic and now we’re all doomed

AND ON CUE THE COATIS pull the VISION up on to the table As
Mirabel tries to snatch it she accidentally sends it sliding
down the table stopping right in front of Abuela Alma
ENCANTO 57

EVERYONE LOOKS AT THE VISION THEN TO MIRABEL and CRACK
CRACK CRACK Cracks ripple seemingly from Mirabel around the
whole room and everyone’s powers fritz and spasm The ground
cracks under Isabela who (shocked) shoots a bunch of vines
directly into Mariano’s face

Pepa’s storm cloud opens up unleashing a torrent of water
onto the whole table As animals race out they blow open the
windows where we can see the WHOLE TOWN out front ready to
celebrate

TOWNSFOLK
FELICIDADES - (SEES CHAOS) whoa

HARD CUT AS the Guzmans leave (dodging more chaos and
animals) with Abuela Alma in tow Mirabel follows into the
courtyard as well

ABUELA ALMA
Senora por favor

MIRABEL
Abuela please -- there’s gotta be
an explanation

Isabela stomps past Mirabel
ISABELA
(to Mirabel dramatic)
I hate you
Luisa races past Mirabel sobbing
LUISA
(crying)

Ahh I’m a loser

AGUSTIN
Luisa

Pepa runs out her weather going crazy
PEPA
(to Mirabel)
What did you do
More cracks ripple through the house
MIRABEL
I’m not doing anything It’s

Bruno’s vision It’s

As Mirabel says that she notices a green light moving on
the ground It’s a shard of the vision
ENCANTO 58

being carried by A RAT There are dozens of rats all of
them are taking the shards from the dining room and racing up
to the balcony

Abuela chases after Abuela Guzman and Mariano

ABUELA ALMA
The magic is strong EVERYTHING IS
FINE We are the Madrigals
(shuts door)
MIRABEL

Thunder CLAPS

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - UPPER WALKWAY - NIGHT

Lightning flashes and thunder rumbles as Mirabel pursues
the wet rats (HOLDING A SHARD) along the upper walkway But
as she turns the corner they’re gone

Then a noise and she spots a single rat tail disappear
through an opening under a LARGE PAINTING Mirabel
approaches the painting studies it then slowly pulls it
open revealing a PASSAGEWAY within the walls

INT BETWEEN THE WALLS - CONTINUOUS

Mirabel climbs into the secret passageway between the walls
of the house to find the inside COVERED in CRACKS which
undulate malevolently What is this place

A rat SQUEAKS as it scurries past Mirabel’s feet and away
into the darkness but as its glowing shard retreats the
glow moves into the air As Mirabel squints to get a better
look FLASH A bolt of lightning illuminates BRUNO
sinister and evil who holds the shard

Mirabel and Bruno stare at each other for an electric second
Another flash and he turns and runs - his shadow streaking
away down a distant corridor Realizing this may be her only
chance to understand Bruno’s terrible vision Mirabel races
after him

MIRABEL
HEY
INT BETWEEN THE WALLS - CONTINUOUS

Mirabel races through the narrow corridors struggling to
catch up in the winding twisting labyrinth
ENCANTO 59

Shafts of light peek through the interior of the house to
illuminate them as they streak by

The rhythm of their feet creates a syncopated rhythm as they
move faster and faster sliding down unexpected drops and
tight turns

INT CASA MADRIGAL - PEPA’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

We pop to the other side of the wall where Camilo is trying
to calm down Pepa

CAMILO
(sooo calming)
It’s okay Mami deep breath in
deep breath out

WHAM Something slams the wall next to them and when Pepa
hears the impact she panics zapping Camilo with lightning

INT BETWEEN THE WALLS - SAME TIME

As Mirabel recovers from slamming a wall another flash
illuminates Mirabel

MIRABEL
Stop STOP

Mirabel is almost to Bruno but he jumps a CHASM and it looks
too far for Mirabel to follow As Bruno disappears down a
distant corridor Mirabel summons her courage and jumps
and MAKES IT But the floor below her gives way and she
falls barely catching herself at the last second but only
holding on by a finger Below is a seemingly endless fall
into DARKNESS

MIRABEL (CONTD)
No-no-- HELP HELP
(desperate to the House)
CASITA CASITA
(but it can’t help)
HELP ME HELP ME

Too late Mirabel loses her grip and falls and -- her hand is
grabbed mid-air by BRUNO His face comes into the light
she sees he’s not at all what she thought he’s small
timid and straining

TIO BRUNO
You’re very sweaty
ENCANTO 60

But before Mirabel can respond the floor underneath Bruno
collapses too Mirabel grabs onto a loose board and catches
Bruno They are now both dangling from the pit As Mirabel
looks at her uncle a rat pop from his cloak -- she startles
and accidentally drops him to his death

MIRABEL
Oh no

But there’s actually floor right beneath he’s fine they
just couldn’t see it Bruno looks around surprised

TIO BRUNO
Huh

Tio Bruno climbs up the wall boards as Mirabel helps him up
Bruno looks to Mirabel a long beat then

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)

Bye
MIRABEL
(confused pursuing)
What No -- Hold on --

Mirabel hurries after Bruno and follows him through a strange
“back of house” tour pipes furniture relics evidence of
the rooms on the other side etc

As Mirabel tries to keep up she sees that Bruno is EXTREMELY
superstitious avoids WALKING UNDER A LADDER has all kinds
of good luck charms around him

MIRABEL (CONTD)

Wait wait -- Ow -- why did you
take the vision -- what does it
mean -- Is it why you came back or--

Tio Bruno passes a piece of wood

TIO BRUNO
Knock knock knock Knock on wood

Then he crosses his fingers and holds his breath

MIRABEL
Tio Bruno

He passes another piece of wood
TIO BRUNO

(tapping a wall OCD)
Knock knock knock Knock on wood
ENCANTO 61

Bruno uncrosses his fingers

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
You were never supposed to see that
vision no one was -- a little
salt

He throws salt behind his back

MIRABEL
But -- (SPUTTERS ON SALT)

TIO BRUNO
Sugar (HE TOSSES SUGAR ON HER)

And keeps walking past rows of HANGING ALOE PLANTS then does
a hop skip and a jump over a series of cracks on the ground

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
Sana sana colita de rana

Mirabel is about to ask a follow-up when they pass an area
with TONS of cracks which have been painstakingly patched up

MIRABEL
Wait have you been in here
patching the cracks

Bruno looks up at all of the patched cracks

TIO BRUNO
Oh that No no no no no I’m
too scared to go near those things
All the patching’s done by
Hernando

MIRABEL
Who is Hernan--

TIO BRUNO

(different voice)
--I’m Hernando and I’m scared of
nothing

(takes off hood regular

voice)
It’s actually me I used to say my
real gift was acting

(yet another voice)
I’m Jorge I make the spackle

Mirabel stares at Bruno
ENCANTO 62

MIRABEL
(beat)
How long have you been back
here

INT BRUNO’S SECRET ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Tight shots on rat habitrails and weird odds-and-ends of a
guy who has lived behind the walls way too long Funny
weird gross filled with family heirlooms and knick-
knacks quirky and oddly charming

MIRABEL
(realizing)
You never left

TIO BRUNO
Well I- I left my tower which was
you know a lotta stairs and uh in
here - (SHOWS FOOD) eh Kitchen
adjacent - ooo plus free
entertainment

ANGLE ON Bruno’s makeshift “RAT-THEATER” - which is
basically a cardboard cut-out that he gets his rats to poke
their faces through by putting food on the other side so that
they unknowingly enact bizarre little plays

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
So whattya like Whattya like You
like sports Game Show
Telenovelas
(re “romantic” rat)
Their love could never be

MIRABEL
(looking around)
I don’t understand

TIO BRUNO
Well because she’s his aunt and
she has amnesia so she can’t
remember that she’s his aunt you
see it’s like a very forbidden kind
of-

MIRABEL
I don’t understand why you “left”
but didn’t “leave”

Bruno looks a little uncomfortable about the question
ENCANTO 63

TIO BRUNO
(avoiding eye-contact)
Oh well because you know the

mountains around the Encanto are
pretty tall and uh - you know
like I said free food and
everything

(to the rats)
Yeah you guys you guys love the
free food don’t ya Always hungry
never satisfied

Mirabel notices a shaft of light she follows it and peers
through to discover the family DINING ROOM on the other side
of the wall She looks down to see Bruno has recreated his
own version of the family table in his little room complete
with a stenciled plate Mirabel looks back to Bruno
realizing how badly this guy still wants to be part of the
family Embarrassed he avoids eye contact

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)

My gift wasn’t helping the
family but uh but I love my
family you know I just don’t
know how to I just don’t know
how to

On that last phrase Bruno finally looks to Mirabel She
realizes how similar they are She’s emotional because she
always felt alone And inferior Bruno shifts awkwardly

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)

Well anyway I think you should go
because um -- well I don’t really
have a good reason but if I did
youd be like I should go ‘cause
that’s a good reason

Mirabel walks over to him gently

MIRABEL

Why was I in your vision Tio
Bruno

(off his look the most

honest she’s been)
I just wanted to make the family
proud of me just once But if I
should stop if I’m hurting my
family just tell me

He looks at her debating revealing his deep secret
ENCANTO 64

TIO BRUNO
I can’t tell you (SHE SIGHS
FRUSTRATED) Because I don’t know

That grabs Mirabel’s attention Bruno takes the shards from
his pocket and starts to assemble them

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
I had this vision the night that
you didn’t get your gift

(Mirabel turns surprised)
Abuela worried about the magic so
she begged me to look into the
future see what it meant

FLASHBACK We see the vision swirling around Bruno

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
And I saw the magic in danger
our house breaking and
then and then and then I saw
you But the vision was different
It it would change and there
was no one answer no clear fate
Like your future was undecided But
I knew how it was gonna look I
knew what everyone would think
because I’m Bruno and everyone
always assumes the worst so
SO

WE SEE BRUNO SMASH THE VISION and LEAVE

Back in the Bruno’s room Mirabel manipulates the vision
seeing it transform from cracks spreading to cracks
disappearing

MIRABEL
You left to protect me

TIO BRUNO
I don’t know which way it’ll go
but my guess the family the
Encanto the fate of the miracle
itself - it’s all gonna come down
to you

This is a big moment for Mirabel a lot to process She
looks at the lenticular adjusting it backwards and forwards
Bruno thinks for half a beat
ENCANTO

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)

(SHRUGS) Or maybe I’m wrong
(CHUCKLES) You know it’s a
mystery it’s a mystery that’s why
this vision is (FART SOUND)

(then walks her to door)
Look if I could help anymore I
would but that’s all I know Good
luck I wish I could’ve seen more

Bruno shuts the door leaving Mirabel alone in the dark
hallway She thinks about what he said

MIRABEL
(nods solemn)
Yeah
(then lightbulb)
Yeah

Mirabel barges back in

MIRABEL (CONTD)
You “wish you could’ve seen more”
So see more (SHAKING BRUNO) Have
another vision

TIO BRUNO
Oh uh no no see I don’t I
don’t do visions anymore

MIRABEL
But ya could

TIO BRUNO
But I won’t

MIRABEL
You can’t say “the weight of the
world is on your shoulders the
end” If our fate’s up to me me
says have another vision maybe
it’1l show me what to do --

TIO BRUNO
Look even if I wanted to which I
don’t you wrecked my vision cave
which is a problem ‘cause I need a
big open space --

MIRABEL
Well find one

TIO BRUNO
Where
ENCANTO 66

ANTONIO (0S)
Use my room

They turn around to see the TAPIR CHIGUIRO COATIS and
ANTONIO He smiles

ANTONIO (CONTD)
The rats told me everything
(then looking 0S)

Don’t eat those

Angle on the Jaguar about to eat some rats it backs
off Mirabel looks back to Bruno

MIRABEL
Our family needs help
(then)
And you need to get outta here

Bruno looks to the rats cleaning themselves with his
toothbrush and then licking the toothbrush

TIO BRUNO
(I see your point)
Mmyeh

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - DAY BREAK

The same kids from the beginning play in the grass in front
of the Madrigal house A crack forms on the ground next to
them and they look up at the CANDLE which flickers
unnaturally The House shakes Weirded out the kids run away
from the House where a GROUP of people are gathered

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - FOYER - SAME TIME

ABUELA ALMA
(to Agustin)
You should have told me the second

Youre lucky it’s not a hurricane

JULIETA
Mama you’ve always been too hard
on Mirabel

Small cracks emerge around them

ABUELA ALMA
Look around We must protect our
family our Encanto We cannot lose
our home

OLD ARTURO ENTERS FROM OUTSIDE (with a crowd from town)

OLD ARTURO
Sefora perdén people in town are
becoming anxious about the magic
They want to see you

ABUELA ALMA
Mirabel was in that vision for a
reason Find her

As Abuela leaves the HOUSE SHAKES and we carry that
tremor into

INT ANTONIO’S RAINFOREST ROOM - SAME TIME
Feeling the tremor animals fly and run off scared

MIRABEL
We might wanna hurry

As Bruno prepares a sand circle for his vision

TIO BRUNO
Ya can’t hurry the future uh

Bruno is making his circle of sand (pouring the sand from his
bucket) and reaches the Chiguiro sitting in his path

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
And what if I show you something
worse If I see something that you
don’t like you’re gonna be all
“Bruno makes bad things happen oh
he’s creepy and his vision killed
ma’ goldfish”
ENCANTO 68

MIRABEL
I don’t think you make bad things
happen Sometimes family weirdos
just get a bad rap You can do
this

Antonio hands Bruno a stuffed jaguar

ANTONIO
(I’ve been there)
For the nerves

Antonio smiles at Bruno and nods like I believe in you
then heads off Bruno looks at the stuffed jaguar then up to
Mirabel considering Then with a weighty exhale Bruno
reaches into his ruana and takes out a handful of salt then
he throws it behind his back

TIO BRUNO
(to himself)
I can do this I can do this I can
do this I can do this

Bruno lights a match which he uses to ignite piles of wet
leaves As the smoke begins to spiral around him and Mirabel
Bruno closes his eyes entering a trance-like state

The magic fills the room and somewhere in the house Bruno’s
door starts to glow On the way to town Abuela pauses at the
strange occurrence unsure of the cause

The entire room begins to glow in the light of his eyes wind
kicks up blowing leaves and sand that begins to SWIRL around
Mirabel and Bruno glowing brighter and brighter Mirabel
looks to Bruno who looks at her and his eyes TWINKLE
GREEN like flecks of glitter

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
You might wanna hang on

He squeezes her hands and energy surrounds them (Out in the
courtyard Bruno’s door begins to spark back to life) But
were back inside as Mirabel gasps with wonder as WHOOSH
Mirabel is suddenly transported into

AN IMPRESSIONISTIC FLASH OF VISIONS

- CHAOS in the house The family running (THIS IS THE PART
OF THE VISION THAT BRUNO WITNESSED ORIGINALLY) Then a
SHAPE MIRABEL standing amidst the expanding cracks
Bruno starts to falter
ENCANTO 69

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
It’s just -- it’s just the same
thing I gotta stop --

MIRABEL
No I need to know which way it
goes -- there’s gotta be an answer

something we’re not seeing

TIO BRUNO
(over the noise)
You’re looking at the same thing
that I am If there was something
else --

Mirabel gets an idea turns the opposite direction Bruno
sees her thinks it’s pointless Mirabel looks and spots a

glitter of gold

MIRABEL
(holy shit)
There -- over there --

Confused Bruno turns and it illuminates a BUTTERFLY
flitting through chaos Bruno can’t believe it

TIO BRUNO
Butterfly Follow the butterfly

As they stand the BUTTERFLY lands on a REED in a RIVER
Which dissolves as something begins to glow behind it

MIRABEL
Where is that

The images flutter Bruno struggles to see it

TIO BRUNO
It’s all outta order --

The image starts to come into focus it’s THE CANDLE
BURNING BRIGHTER CRACKS DISAPPEARING

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
It’s it’s -- it’s the candle The
candle’s getting brighter

NEARBY IS A SILHOUETTE OF MIRABEL IN MOTION ARMS OUT
TIO BRUNO (CONTD)

I think you’re gonna help the
candle
ENCANTO 70

MIRABEL
How

Bruno’s vision moves showing Mirabel and a GLOWING FIGURE
Who is it As Mirabel wills herself to bring the figure into
focus we see the shape of a WOMAN

TIO BRUNO
There’s someone with you And you -
you fight her

MIRABEL
What

Bruno squints trying to interpret what he’s seeing

TIO BRUNO
Wait no no no no -- is that a
hug
MIRABEL
Am I fighting or hugging
TIO BRUNO
An embrace -- AN EMBRACE -- to

make the candle bright you have to
embrace her

MIRABEL
Embrace who

The images grow more and more volatile

TIO BRUNO
Almost there

MIRABEL
Who is it

TIO BRUNO
Almost there I I -- I got it

As Mirabel steps forward it’s it’s ISABELA

MIRABEL
Isabela

A FLASH OF LIGHT ENDS THE VISION leaving us with glittering
sand which falls onto the chiguiro Bruno looks at the new
emerald vision “plate” and smiles

TIO BRUNO
Oh your sister that’s great
ENCANTO 71

Mirabel stares at it in disbelief Bruno realizes she’s hates
his vision He chucks it like it’s garbage

TIO BRUNO (CONTD)
Every time

INT CASA MADRIGAL - UPPER BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

We start tight on Isabela’s door pull back to find Bruno and
Mirabel staring at it from behind a plant

MIRABEL (PRELAP)
Why would “embracing Isabela” do
anything

TIO BRUNO
Idaknow our family got a miracle
how do you help a family miracle
You hug a sister

Mirabel looks at Bruno like he’s stupid A noise below draws
them to Camilo who walks across the courtyard Mirabel and
Bruno duck

CAMILO
(calling out)
Mirabel Mirabel

Camilo’s powers fritz and he gets a baby head

BACK TO MIRABEL AND BRUNO Bruno looks from Camilo to the
candle which flickers Mirabel is too busy worrying

TIO BRUNO
Oh I think we’re running outta
time here

MIRABEL
It’s not gonna work She won’t hug
me ever okay She hates me Also
I don’t know if you heard I ruined
her proposal Plus PS--

TIO BRUNO
-- Mirabel --

MIRABEL
-- it is just annoying -- of course

TIO BRUNO
-- Mirabel --
ENCANTO 72

MIRABEL

-- and what’s her problem with me

anyway she’s the one with roses

coming out her--
TIO BRUNO

Mirabel Oh sorry sorry sorry

The fate of the family is not up to

her it’s up to you Youre exactly

what this family needs You just

have to see it

(then casual)

By yourself after I leave
MIRABEL

What You’re not coming

Bruno moves a tall potted plant -- hiding him from view as he

waddles toward the portrait leading to his secret passageway

TIO BRUNO
(“important prophecy” )

It was your vision Mirabel not

mine
MIRABEL

Youre afraid Abuela will see you
TIO BRUNO

Yep I mean yes that too

(then)
Hey after you save the miracle
come visit

MIRABEL

(smiles then)
After I save the miracle I’m

bringing you home

Bruno gives Mirabel a smile then knocks on wood crosses his
fingers holds his breath and tips backwards into the wall

TIO BRUNO
Knock-knock-knock-knock-knock-knock
on wood

After he leaves Mirabel notices candle and magic’s glow
becoming more and more erratic Mirabel looks toward
Isabela’s glowing door psyching herself up

MIRABEL
You got this Just gonna save the
miracle (SO DUMB) with a hug
ENCANTO 73
With that Mirabel heads to Isa’s door

INT CASA MADRIGAL - ISABELA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel enters ISABELA’S AMAZING FLOWER ROOM It’s a lush
Colombian flower garden tropical and very very PINK
Isabela is nowhere to be found Mirabel looks around
cautiously

MIRABEL
(super sweet)
Isa Hey

Mirabel continues through the room

MIRABEL (CONTD)
(calling out)

I know weve had our issues
but I’m (HATING SAYING IT) ready
to be a better sister to you

So we should just hug Let’s
hug it out Eh

Mirabel looks up to find Isabela on a crazy flower bed
which looks more over-the-top than usual

ISABELA (0S)
(menacing)
Hug it out
(then)
Luisa can’t lift an empanada
Mariano’s nose looks like a smashed
papaya Have you lost your mind

MIRABEL
Isa I feel like you’re upset
and you know what cures being
upset A warm embrace

ISABELA
Get out

As Mirabel starts to protest a flower pops out of the vine
covering Mirabel’s mouth

ISABELA (CONTD)
Everything was perfect Abuela was
happy the family was happy you
wanna be a better sister apologize
for ruining my life

ISABELA (CONTD)
Go on apologize
ENCANTO 74

The room shakes catching Mirabel’s attention

MIRABEL
(that’s a tough one)
I am Sorry
(can’t keep going)
That your life is so great

ISABELA
Out

With a wave of her hand Isabela’s vines drag Mirabel toward
the door Worried she’1ll miss this important opportunity
Mirabel tries to grab onto furniture to stop her momentum

MIRABEL
Wait fine “I apologize” -
(the vine tugs her)
I wasn’t trying to ruin your life --
(struggles ungracefully)
Some of us have bigger problems
you selfish entitled princess

ISABELA
Selfish I’ve been stuck being
perfect my whole entire life and
literally the only thing you have
ever done for me is mess things up

Mirabel tries to extricate herself from Isabela’s vines as
she keeps getting dragged backwards

MIRABEL
Nothing is messed up You can still
marry that big dumb hunk-

ISABELA
I NEVER WANTED TO MARRY HIM I WAS
DOING IT FOR THE FAMILY

Whoa That was a big bomb that was dropped A tiny cactus
pops up between them Mirabel (oblivious to the cactus
stares at Isabela seemingly stunned about Mariano)

MIRABEL
Oh my gosh Isa that is a very
serious confession
(then stands deep
breath not slick
extends arms)
Okay get over here bring it in
ENCANTO 75

But Isa doesn’t respond she isn’t looking at Mirabel
she’s looking at the ground at THAT WEIRD LITTLE CACTUS
Isabela is transfixed THE HOUSE SHUDDERS

MIRABEL (CONTD)
(hello)
Isa

Isa picks up the cactus mesmerized

ISABELA
(singing)
I JUST MADE SOMETHING UNEXPECTED
SOMETHING SHARP
SOMETHING NEW

Isabela excited ignores Mirabel and turns away holding her
cactus

first place
ENCANTO 79

MIRABEL

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

Isabela grabs onto Mirabel they dive through a kaleidoscope
of plants and flowers crashing down to the courtyard like
kids jumping into a leaf pile

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Mirabel and Isabela lie in the pile of flowers giddy and
exhausted

ISABELA
(giggling)
You’re a bad influence

Mirabel grins enjoying the evolution of their relationship

ABUELA ALMA (0S)

It’s okay everything’s -- we’re
gonna save the miracle - the magic -

ABUELA ALMA
What are you talking about Look at
our home Look at your sister

MIRABEL
Please just - Isabela wasn’t happy
and -

ABUELA ALMA
Of course she isn’t happy you
ruined her proposal --

MIRABEL
-- no no she needed me to ruin her
proposal and then we did all of
this and the candle burned brighter
and the cracks --

ABUELA ALMA
-- Mirabel --

MIRABEL
That’s why I’m in the vision I’m
saving the miracle

ABUELA ALMA
You have to stop Mirabel

A TREMOR shakes the entire ENCANTO Luisa enters the
courtyard concerned and stands with Isabela

ABUELA ALMA (CONTD)
The cracks started with you Bruno
left because of you Luisa’s losing
her powers Isabela’s out of
control because of you I don’t
know why you weren’t given a gift
but it is not an excuse for you to
hurt this family

As Abuela says that cracks emerge all around her Mirabel’s
heart nearly breaks as she looks at Abuela Julieta and
Agustin enter having heard the argument

MIRABEL
I will never be good enough for
you Will I No matter how hard I
try

Then a quiet realization as she looks at her family
ENCANTO 81

MIRABEL (CONTD)
No matter how hard any of us tries
(then)
Luisa will never be strong enough
Isabela wont be perfect enough --
Bruno left our family because you
only saw the worst in him--

ABUELA ALMA
-- Bruno didn’t care about this
family --

MIRABEL
He loves this family - I love this
family We all love this family
You’re the one that doesn’t care

You’re the one breaking our home

Cracks begins to spread into the town

ABUELA ALMA
Don’t you ever --

MIRABEL
The miracle is dying because of
you

In that awful moment a huge cracks rips open between them
As they both stare at each other stunned horrified

PEPA
No no no --

FELIX (0S)
The candle

CRACK A huge crack nearly rips the House in half snaking
all the way up to the CANDLE which begins to melt at a
rapid pace teetering and in danger of falling into the dark
chasm created by the cracks

As everyone tries to get their bearings Mirabel snaps out of
it and races to save the candle She calls to the House

MIRABEL
Casita get me up there

The house pulls a railing from the balcony for Mirabel to use
as a ladder to climb to the roof

Isabela tries to use her vines to reach the candle but her
door fades and her vines dissipate like they were Thanos-
snapped The house catches Isabela and breaks her fall
ENCANTO 82

Camilo tries to change his shape to reach the candle but his
door fades and his powers go out The house catches Camilo
and sets him down to safety but he can’t reach the candle

CAMILO
No

Mirabel reaches the top of the roof and looks back to see
the MOUNTAINS of the ENCANTO crack open just like in Bruno’s
vision

Nearby Antonio watches as his animals smash out of his door
which dies and the animals streak off A chunk of the House
falls toward him and Félix narrowly saves him

FELIX
Careful Antonio We gotta get out
of here

JULIETA

Mirabel Mirabel

But the House sees the danger too and starts pushing people
out of the House to save them Desperately using its last bit
of power to keep them safe

AGUSTIN
Mirabel You have to get out

JULIETA
Mirabel

Bruno runs through space in the walls as the walls close in
on him Bruno saves a rat puts a bucket on his head and rams
through the wall landing on the grass outside still unseen
by the family Mirabel looks over the side of the House and
sees Bruno is safe and races to the candle Abuela gets
pushed out the front door and looks up to see Mirabel
clambering across the roof to the candle

JULIETA (CONTD)
Mirabel Mirabel leave it

ON THE ROOF

Mirabel reaches for the candle but falters The House
supports her in the nick of time propping her back up

FELIX (0S)
Mirabel The House is gonna fall

PEPA (0S)
Mirabel Get out
ENCANTO 83

AGUSTIN
Mirabel

Mirabel strains to reach the sputtering candle

Just as Mirabel finally grabs the candle Bruno’s tower
collapses on the roof The house slides Mirabel out the way
and off the balcony as debris falls down

Mirabel lands but has no time to escape In an instant the
House shields Mirabel saving her life

In the aftermath Mirabel looks down to see the candle go
out

MIRABEL
(tiny )
No

Then a tiny squeak as the House shutters that just saved
her life wave an injured goodbye and as Mirabel looks up
devastated the house dies

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - CONTINUOUS

As Mirabel sits in the rubble family members race in but
Mirabel is in a fog Julieta runs towards Mirabel in the
rubble

JULIETA

miles away)

We begin to hear just the slightest background walla of the
family in chaos As we PUSH IN ON MIRABEL’S FACE
Julieta comes to check on Mirabel

JULIETA (CONTD)
(garbled through the fog)
Mirabel Are you hurt Mirabel

Mirabel shakes her head “no she isn’t hurt” But she is in
shock and reeling

ENCANTO 84

Julieta leaves to go check on the rest of the family Mirabel
can only hear everyone continuing to panic

PEPA (0S)
How could this happen

AGUSTIN (0S)
Everyone okay Is everyone okay

Mirabel looks over to see Dolores helping Abuela who is
despondent and in shock As Mirabel watches Abuela how
lost and broken she looks Mirabel’s chin starts to quiver
as the weight of her failure becomes overwhelming This is
Mirabel’s failure and she knows it

DOLORES
Here let me help you let me help

FAMILY WALLA (0S)
Antonio don’t cry papito don’t

We go tighter on Julieta grabbing medicine bottles then
turning to find Mirabel but Mirabel is gone

As Mirabel starts to cry Abuela begins to speak we’ve
never heard her voice like this she’s broken exhausted
old She looks to the water

ABUELA ALMA

Abuela sits by Mirabel they look out at the river

ABUELA ALMA (CONTD)
This river is where we were
given our miracle

MIRABEL

Mirabel looks at Abuela trying to understand where she’s
coming from she looks so lost and frail Abuela looks back
to the water

EXT VILLAGE - DAY - PAST

Young Abuela Alma moves through her village a HOLIDAY CANDLE
FESTIVAL underway She’s a different person young and full
of life She grabs a candle and hops up on the railing of a
bridge to see the festivities As she does she notices
YOUNG ABUELO PEDRO (20s) doing the same -- he smiles at
her as she smiles back she almost loses her balance It’s
funny imperfect - and she doesn’t take it too seriously

As the festivities continue in the background Alma and Pedro
sit talking love beginning to blossom Young Abuela offers
him a snack from her basket He looks into her eyes as he
eats it Butterflies swarm around them

Alma and Pedro have finished packing what little they can

they cross it Alma and Pedro look at each other we can
see Pedro is encouraging Alma his eyes saying they will be

okay MIRABEL watches them but as she does the CANDLE
in PEDRO’S HAND FLICKERS UNNATURALLY and he looks back to
see evil men on horseback approaching far in the distance

The whole group runs desperate through the river Fleeing
But the terrain makes it hard to run away Young Alma looks
to Pedro panicking She holds her babies tight

As chaos swirls around them Pedro makes a choice he
looks back to where the horsemen are coming from then looks
back into Alma’s eyes She knows exactly what he’s about to
do and we can see her emotions building her fear
growing

Pedro catches her eyes lifts her face to his
“everything will be okay” is what his eyes are saying He

looks down to his three newborn babies kisses their heads
and kisses Alma full of love He looks into her eyes
telling her she will survive she will thrive their

children will find a new home and have a better life

Pedro races back to beg the men on horseback to let them
live They listen to his plea and ignore it And just like
that Pedro is lost

SONG (CONTD)
AY ORUGUITAS (oh caterpillars)
NO SE AGUANTEN MAS (don’t hold each
other any longer)
HAY QUE CRECER (you must grow)
APARTE Y VOLVER (apart and return)
HACIA ADELANTE SEGUIRAS (that’s the
way forward)
VIENEN MILAGROS (miracles are
coming)
VIENEN CRISALIDAS (chrysalises are
coming)
HAY QUE PARTIR (you must part)
Y CONSTRUIR (and construct
SU PROPIO FUTURO (your own future)

As people around her panic Abuela looks to the river where
Pedro was lost then looks to her babies her family
the lives she is now responsible for Mirabel watches
stunned horrified scared
ENCANTO 90

As the horses approach Abuela sinks to her knees tears in
her eyes begging the earth to spare the lives of her
babies Praying for salvation She puts her hand INTO THE
SOIL

And suddenly the ground around her begins to glow the
candle fills with magic and the villains are blown back
We see Abuela crying heartbroken but saved

But as the people around her look around in awe and
appreciation Abuela isn’t celebrating she’s staring
out at the river where Pedro died as the MOUNTAINS rise up
and occlude it from her view

INT ABUELA ALMA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - PAST

Young Abuela in her bedroom which we now realize is an
exact copy of the room she once shared with Pedro looks
heartbroken and vulnerable She sits in the same place she
did in her old apartment

SONG
DOS ORUGUITAS (two caterpillars)
DESORIENTADAS (disoriented)
EN DOS CAPULLOS (in two cocoons)
BIEN ABRIGADAS (all bundled up)

She looks to the babies in her arms she cannot be weak for
them she must be strong their Encanto must never break
the way her old home did We see her steel herself WIPE
AWAY HER TEARS This is where she began to change where she
armored up and became the Abuela we’ve come to know She
picks up the candle and shawl and heads out

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
I was given a miracle a second
chance and I was so afraid to
lose it that I lost sight of who
our miracle was for

As she passes each new child’s door years pass and she
becomes harder and harder on her family more rigid more
limiting Her expectations growing more unhealthy We move
from child to child until we reach MIRABEL whose door
vanishes Mirabel looks to Abuela for compassion And this
time Abuela sees her mistake but it’s too late

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
And I am so sorry

Abuela turns and finds herself in the rubble of the house
The candle gone Everything she had hoped for destroyed
Abuela falls to her knees
ENCANTO 91

ABUELA ALMA (VO)
-You never hurt our family
Mirabel We are broken Because
of me

EXT RIVER BANK - PRESENT DAY
We transition back to Mirabel and Abuela at her most

vulnerable Ashamed Abuela stops speaking Mirabel takes in
her grandmother All her pain and good intentions gone

wrong
But as Mirabel looks to Abuela she sees something behind
her in the distance a BUTTERFLY which flits onto a

reed in the middle of the water Just like in the vision

Mirabel stares at the butterfly transfixed Mirabel then
looks at Abuela understanding what this moment is that
the person Mirabel has always needed to embrace is Abuela

MIRABEL
Abuela I can finally see You
lost your home lost

everything you suffered so
much all alone so it would
never happen again

(then)

We were saved because of you We
were given a miracle because of
you We are a family because of
you And nothing could ever be
broken that we can’t fix
together

As this lands on Abuela her heart seems to crack open She
feels a great weight lift from her shoulders It is a quiet
moment of release fifty year in the making And suddenly
the SUN PEEKS THROUGH THE CLOUDS illuminating the river
beautiful pink hues wondrous and spectacular Alma looks at
Mirabel in awe and hugs her tightly tears in her eyes

ABUELA ALMA
(as they hug)
I asked my Pedro for help
Mirabel he sent me you

As they embrace in the middle of the river the butterfly
flaps into the wind and soon thousands of butterflies
begin to fill the air swirling around them Mirabel tears
up filled with emotion Abuela looks at the butterflies
this beautiful moment this place redefined
ENCANTO 92

SONG
AY MARIPOSAS (oh butterflies)
NO SE AGUANTEN MAS (don’t hold each
other any longer)
HAY QUE CRECER (you must grow)
APARTE Y VOLVER (apart and return)
HACIA ADELANTE SEGUIRAS (that’s the
way forward)

The music swells as even more BUTTERFLIES begin to swarm
around them and in this moment they begin to
MIGRATE back in the direction of the ENCANTO like a
AERIAL SUPERHIGHWAY of BUTTERFLIES Mirabel looks up
feeling the pull excited for what the future holds

SONG (CONTD)
YA SON MILAGROS (you are already
miracles)
ROMPIENDO CRISALIDAS (breaking
chrysalises)
HAY QUE VOLAR (you must fly)
HAY QUE ENCONTRAR (and find)
SU PROPIO FUTURO (your own future)

END SONG

EXT RIVERBANK - MOMENTS LATER

As Mirabel and Abuela return to the riverbank something

dark and large crashes through the wilderness in front of

them it’s BRUNO ON A HORSE Awkward and ridiculous
TIO BRUNO

She didn’t do this She didn’t do
this I gave her a vision It was
me I was like go And she was like
fttt She only wanted to help I
don’t care what you think of me

but if you’re too stubborn to to --

Abuela Alma embraces and kisses him
ABUELA ALMA
(quiet remorseful)
Brunito
Bruno is confused He looks to Mirabel
TIO BRUNO

I feel like I missed something
important
ENCANTO 93

MIRABEL
Come on

Abuela gives Bruno an affectionate look before taking his
hand and walking after Mirabel Mirabel climbs up on the
horse She helps Abuela who helps Bruno

TIO BRUNO
What - what’s happening where are
we going

MIRABEL
Home

As exciting music kicks in they gallop away back towards
the Encanto

EXT ENCANTO —- MORNING

We find MIRABEL racing on the horse like a BONAFIDE
HERO Abuela and Bruno cling to her a heroic trio returning

- THE KIDS and TOWNSPEOPLE IN TOWN watch awestruck and
MIRABEL races through the streets The kids see her and freak
out

PUMPED JUANCHO
It’s her I FOUND HER

LITTLE ALEJANDRA
I found her

INNOCENT CECILIA
She’s back she’s back she’s back

EXT CASA MADRIGAL - RUINS - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel skids to a stop on the side of the ruined house
For a moment she’s taken aback by the severity of the
damage but Mirabel doesn’t let it shake her confidence As
she hurries around to the front Julieta comes running from
the other side

JULIETA (0S)
Mirabel

Julieta runs to Mirabel relieved that her daughter has
returned and is okay She grasps Mirabel in a hug

JULIETA (CONTD)

Mirabel puts her hand on her dad’s welted face

AGUSTIN (CONTD)

CAMILO (0S)

They look to Camilo Félix nudges Camilo with his elbow

CAMILO (CONTD)
(OFF FELIX) What We don’t have a
house I can’t say we don’t have a
house What is that Not a house

Mirabel walks up to the standing arch which used to be the
front door of the house She starts singing to the family

MIRABEL
LOOK AT THIS HOME
WE NEED A NEW FOUNDATION
IT MAY SEEM HOPELESS
BUT WE’LL GET BY JUST FINE

The family begins to assemble in front of her

MIRABEL (CONTD)
LOOK AT THIS FAMILY
A GLOWING CONSTELLATION
SO FULL OF STARS
AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO SHINE
BUT THE STARS DON’T SHINE THEY
BURN
AND THE CONSTELLATIONS SHIFT
I THINK IT’S TIME YOU LEARN
YOURE MORE THAN JUST YOUR GIFT

ABUELA WALKS UP and through the archway
ENCANTO 95

ABUELA ALMA
AND I’M SORRY I HELD ON TOO TIGHT
JUST SO AFRAID I’D LOSE YOU TOO
(ABUELA beckons over the
shadowy figure of Bruno)
THE MIRACLE IS NOT
SOME MAGIC THAT YOU’VE GOT
THE MIRACLE IS YOU NOT SOME GIFT
JUST YOU

ABUELAMIRABEL
THE MIRACLE IS YOU ALL OF YOU ALL
OF YOU

The reunited triplets hug Camilo stares at Bruno

CAMILO

Bruno nods awkward

TIO BRUNO

spinning her around)

The TOWNSPEOPLE appear over the crest of the mountain We see
the TOWN CHILDREN MARIANO and his Abuela everyone we’ve

TOWNSPEOPLE

The Madrigals and the town begin to rebuild the home Over
the next rebuilding montage Bruno helps map out the layout
of the house with his sand Pumped Juancho chugs a bunch of
coffee and nails like a fiend and we find Mirabel Isabela
and Luisa the three have never been this closer

ENCANTO 99

MIRABEL

TIO BRUNO
WE NEED A DOOR-KNOB

ANTONIO
WE MADE THIS ONE FOR YOU

Antonio hands Mirabel a NEW DOORKNOB with an “M” on it
Mirabel looks up to see the family gathering around her
Antonio takes Mirabel’s hand and walks her toward the front
door People in town begin to join as well

CAMILODOLORESFELIXPEPA
WE SEE HOW BRIGHT YOU BURN

LUISAISABELA

AGUSTINJULIETA
NOW SEE YOURSELF IN TURN

TIO BRUNO
YOURE THE REAL GIFT KID
LET US IN

Abuela touches Mirabel’s face proud emotional

ABUELA ALMA
OPEN YOUR EYES
(then small)
Abre los ojos What do you see

But Mirabel looks at her reflection in her doorknob and
smiles

MIRABEL
I see me
(then)
All of me

Mirabel looks to her family who all smile back Mirabel
turns then places HER doorknob into the FRONT DOOR of the
House and WHOOSH AN EXPLOSION OF LIGHT races over the
entire Encanto restoring its magic and redefining the
cracks that spread to the entire town A new miracle

As the House comes back to life once more the House “waves”
at Mirabel and she waves back

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Hola Casita
ENCANTO 100

As Mirabel waves the house zips her through the front doors
into the home Mirabel looks back to her family and the
gathering crowd from town

MIRABEL (CONTD)
Cmon get in here

The House yanks everyone else into the House too and they
cheer and celebrate

INT CASA MADRIGAL - COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Mirabel enters the courtyard to see everyone’s doors glowing
with a NEW kind of magic The doors are unformed gifts no
longer set in stone

Antonio rides past on his JAGUAR Isabela creates new
bizarre plants transforming herself away from expected
“perfection” Luisa regains her strength but the donkeys
(under Antonio’s supervision) carry her to a hammock to relax
with a beverage Snow begins to falls overhead and we pan
over to Pepa who is dancing under her snow cloud with Félix

Watching all of this is Mirabel Bruno and Abuela Alma who
are suddenly yanked off screen by the House which grabs
the entire family placing them for a NEW FAMILY PORTRAIT
The House slides over the camera and one of Bruno’s rats
snaps a picture as

ABUELA ALMA
Everyone together

The Casita squeezes this whole imperfectly perfect family
together

FAMILY AND MIRABEL
La Familia Madrigal

THE END
