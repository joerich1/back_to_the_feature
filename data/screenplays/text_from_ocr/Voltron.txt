VOICE (0C)

Keith

WIDER TO REVEAL-

INT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - EVENING
KEITH KOGAN (30s)

Tattoos all over his chest and arms various icons from a
life long since past Tough A reluctant leader This is
not a guy who plays well with others He’d rather run
through fire than do what you told him to

He’s sleeping in some kind of crawl space grimy and
claustrophobic His personal area is simple well-kept
Like a prison cell A HAM radio in the corner a stockpile
of food a Catholic crucifix

VOICE (0C)
(more urgent)
Keith get up man

Keith sits up and pulls back the tarp to reveal-
LANCE MCCLAIN (black 20s)

Like Keith he’s in tattered clothing But Lance is more
light-weight jovial less intense He even wears a smile

KEITH
(checking his watch)
What did I tell you about when the door’s
closed

LANCE
You said only when it’s huge This is
huge And what is that a watch Does
that even work anymore

Keith ignores him Rubs his face gets his bearings

LANCE (cont’d)
Afternoon patrol just came back Tony
says a bird went down over midtown
Fancy military-style Crashed and
burned over on 34th

KELTH
So

LANCE
So we got the jump You always say we’re
picking up everyone else’s leftovers but
if you want warm supplies you gotta go
where it’s warm And I’m telling you
there is where it’s warm

Lance pauses waits for a response

LANCE (cont’d)
What do you say You down

KELTH
(stands)
Sure What the hell

He grabs a set of IGNITION KEYS off a nearby hanger

INT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

They’re in an abandoned subway tunnel illuminated by
scattered barrel fires

CROWDS OF PEOPLE live along the walls Like a small city
All walks of life are represented young old sick
healthy white black every distinction has been erased by
their great poverty

Propane tanks fuel various apparatuses that they use to
survive Water filtration plumbing vents

Signs on the wall Postings for missing persons Others
read rules and warnings such as “SEXUAL ASSAULTS WILL BE
PUNISHABLE BY EXECUTION”

Children watch televisions propped up on apple boxes French
cartoons They don’t even speak French It doesn’t matter
When the show’s over they rewind and start again

Women raise their arms to Keith as he walks by begging him
for supplies He keeps his focus straight ahead This is
every day for him

LANCE
You gotta move up Fifth okay Sixth is
blocked I’m going to repeat this
because last time we got in trouble when
I didn’t make myself clear Stay Away
From Sixth Avenue

KE ITH
Let’s try this Why don’t I stay down
here and chew your ear out while you
risk your ass on the surface How’s that
sound

LANCE
No thanks I’m a status quo guy

They arrive at a threshold and Keith plants his arm in front
of Lance so that he can go first

INT EQUIPMENT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Like a small underground auto parts facility Keith and
Lance have customized the place so that equipment hangs from
every wall And in the center of the room is-

A CONVERTED M2A3 BRADLEY TANK

No ordinary military vehicle This has been souped-up and
customized to the nines Painted a deeper shade of black
floodlights all around weapons re-fashioned and sealed up

Keith pulls a lever and the rear hatch drops open He climbs
into an operating console customized so that it can be
operated by one person Inserts the ignition key

Lance passes him a New York Yellow Cab street map Old and
weathered

LANCE
I circled the location real nice Try to
bring that map back will you Last one
I got Oh and heads up It’s Dukane’s
neighborhood now

KE ITH
When did that happen

LANCE
He wiped out the Troikas yesterday So
hey look at it this way You don’t have
to worry about the Troikas anymore

Keith pulls a lever and the door closes behind him Lance
goes over to a hydraulic console and activates the lift

The platform that the tank sits on suddenly RISES UP towards
a grate above them which OPENS and gives them street access

EXT NEW YORK CITY - SURFACE STREETS - NIGHT

A dark empty desolate rainy urban wasteland Not an
inhabitable world It looks like a great war was fought and
lost No electricity Think of a cross between ESCAPE FROM
NEW YORK and a Vonnegut apocalypse fantasy

Adding to the fun Billie Holiday’s 1944 “I’1ll Be Seeing You”
blasts from a record player on a nearby rooftop Someone’s
idea of an absurd joke Opiates for whoever’s dumb enough to
be up here

Keith’s Bradley tank moves through the debris crushing a
collapsed McDonald’s sign on its way Floodlights swivel
back and forth catching glimpses of human stragglers running
in and out of alleys

Above in the buildings SOLDIERS - scrappy gang members men
and women alike watch him through night vision scopes He
rings his light in a steady pattern A code they recognize

SOLDIER 1
Black 22 Moving through

On the next corner someone hears the call and passes it
along

SOLDIER 2
Black 22

And so on They’re telling others he’s coming through

Inside his tank Keith scans the area using a homemade radar
tracking system

He stops at a roadblock ahead A young child runs out
wearing a flak helmet and waving a RED FLAG He gets into
one of the cars forming the barricade and pulls it aside

EXT MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - LATER
CRANING UPWARDS

Along the height of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING entirely
devoid of life We realize the building is actually lying on
its side having been toppled over at its base

Keith’s Bradley shines a spotlight across its face as he
passes GANG SYMBOLS have been inscribed with spray paint
Territorial markers What once said “TROIKAS FOREVER” has
been crossed out and says “NOT QUITE” over it

EXT FIFTH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS

The rear hatch opens and Keith climbs out carrying a red
night-vision flashlight and a 45mm pistol His eyes stay
focused on nearby rooftops

At his feet is a discarded handle of JOHNNIE WALKER BLACK
He picks it up opens the top and takes a swig Still good
He shoves it into his backpack

Just then he hears distant rummaging Knows he’s not alone
He SPINS AROUND and finds himself staring down-

A GIANT WHITE STALLION

A full-grown Andalusian with a flowing mane Untouched
beauty Totally out of place among the urban ruin Alone in
the wild

As Keith gazes into the stallion’s stoic eyes he shares a
brief peace with it This is a kindred soul A fellow
survivor in the world of the dead

He holsters his pistol The horse gallops away

Then he turns back and climbs over a pile of a automobile
carcasses lumped on top of each other like a hurricane hit
Finally he arrives on the other side where-

AN ENORMOUS TOMAHAWK HELICOPTER

Has crashed landed in the middle of Fifth Avenue

Except this isn’t just any military-issue chopper This
thing has been souped up and not necessarily with Earth-

based technology Wires exterior piping even motherboards
have been soldered to the aluminum fuselage

Keith examines the parts curiously Instead of fuel reserves
it seems to run off of

PROPANE GAS He’s never seen anything like it

He checks for signs of life A DEAD PILOT in the front seat
Killed on impact Arabic lettering on his helmet

In the cargo bay is a STOCKPILE of weapons Hand grenades
carbine assault rifles land mines ammunition boxes Enough
to fight a war Food rations and bottled water And a dozen
propane cannisters Jackpot

Keith makes multiple trips back and forth to load up his
tank Then just when he’s on his last trip he hears-

A LOW RUMBLING

On the horizon He draws his 45mm and sees turning the
corner-

FIVE BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS

Is it some kind of alien craft Or is it-

A MONSTER TRUCK

With stadium speakers and lighting rigs mounted on its roof
Keith lowers his pistol and waits for it to get closer
Finally right when it’s bearing down on him it slows toa
halt The door opens and-

SEVERAL PARAMILITARY SOLDIERS EMERGE

Combat gear bullet-proof vests rifles and RPG’s They
immediately establish a perimeter around Keith while
simultaneously keeping their eyes on their surroundings

KEITH
Too late boys stake’s been claimed

DUKANE (0C)
You got muscle to back that up Kogan

From the fray steps-

DUKANE (30s)

Japanese-American powerful and arrogant The leader of this
rag-tag group One of his eyes is missing Scars run down

his cheek Like everyone else in this world he’s stood the
test of time And what a test it’s been

KE LTH
I heard you pushed out Giovanni

DUKANE
Yeah Small misunderstanding
Everyone’s straight now
(re helicopter)
That’s a real find Anything left

KEITH
For you Sure I’11 give you wholesale
rates Just between friends

A soldier moves towards Keith’s tank to check what he’s
taken Keith RAISES HIS 45MM against the soldier’s head
Everyone releases their safeties

DUKANE
We’re taking the chopper And whatever
else came with it

KEITH
Hey You want to run me over at least
give me the courtesy of a reach-around-

DUKANE
You act like there’s still a rule book
somewhere

Keith and Dukane stare off Neither man is backing down
Then just when it’s about to get real ugly

THUD

Distant and removed The huge footstep of a COLOSSAL
CREATURE

Another THUD This one getting closer

DUKANE (cont’d)
Perimeter check

Dukane’s men train their weapons on the surrounding
buildings A few run towards cover carrying RPG’s with
them Suddenly Keith is the least of their worries

KEITH
Well thanks for stopping by Dukane you
know how I love catching up-

DUKANE

Don’t go anywhere
(to soldiers)

Don’t let him move

A few soldiers remain thelr weapons pointed at Keith But
they’re scared their eyes jumping around wildly

THUD

Much closer this time Whatever’s out there it’s got to he
just around the corner now

KEITH
You and your boys willing to die for this
claim

DUKANE
Shut up-

KEITH

Because that’s what’s going to happen
unless we call it even right now

DUKANE
Shut Up

Suddenly-

WHAM

AN ENORMOUS METALLIC FOOT

Comes crashing down out of nowhere CRUSHING ONE OF DUKANE’S
SOLDIERS in its wake Where there once was a man there’s
now some kind of enormous robotic leg stretching up higher
and higher to reveal-

A COLOSSAL ROBOTIC FORM

Fifty-feet tall a horrible hybrid of metal parts complete
with some kind of awful face and GLOWING RED EYES staring
down at them We’re not sure if this is alien or man-made

but it’s terrifying

This is a ROBEAST

It emits a high-pitched INDUSTRIAL ROAR and swings its head
low over the street It swipes at the soldiers with its
enormous talons as if they were in the way of what it’s
really looking for

wwwverypdfcom

The HEAVY-DUTY EQUIPMENT they came in with It crushes one
of the cars and ASSIMILATES ITS MASS INTO ITS OWN It’s not
even paying the soldiers any regard They’re just collateral
damage in the RoBeast’s eyes

Keith tries to dive into his tank but one of its four giant

legs blocks his path The RoBeast is about to come down on
him when-

WEAPONS FIRE

From the soldiers distracts it It ROARS and rears back
The bullets simply absorb into its mass

One of the soldiers climbs onto a rooftop with a SHOULDER-

MOUNTED RPG He fires The missile sails through the air
and straight into the RoBeast’s chest Moments later-

BOOM

The creature EXPLODES into a thousand pieces Metal flesh
and shrapnel fly in every direction raining down over Fifth
Avenue as stragglers find cover

Soldiers cheer loudly Keith and Dukane scan the wreckage

KEITH
That buys us about thirty seconds

DUKANE
I guess this is where we sign off then

Keith nods and quickly ducks into his tank He pulls the
hatch shut and revs it into gear Dukane orders his men to
move out as well They sprint towards the monster truck
Behind them resting in the middle of the debris is a-

SINGLE METALLIC SPHERE

About the size of a basketball This is called an energy
cell It is the source egg of a RoBeast’s life

It begins to GLOW AND HUM An electromagnetic pulse grows
from the center spreading through the air Static
electricity rises over all the metal surfaces And slowly

OBJECTS ARE DRAWN TOWARDS THE CORE

Linking up re-shaping bending around each other as if drawn
together by some higher logic Out of the debris the

RoBeast is rebuilding itself

Keith’s tank pulls off around a corner and disappears before
this can happen The energy core recedes farther and farther
in the distance as we-

INT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - NIGHT

Lance winds the crank that lowers Keith’s tank down on the
platform back into the depths of the subway tunnel

It hits the bottom and Keith climbs out Lance observes
scratches to the vehicle’s hull

LANCE
Ah man what’d you do You know how long
it’s gonna take me to fix this

KEITH
Ran into some friends I owe you one

Keith pulls out several crates from the helicopter He drops
them on the ground Lance finds the propane cannisters

LANCE
Where the hell did you find these

Keith breaks open another crate to reveal several BOTTLES OF
WATER Lance observes it in amazement

LANCE (cont’d)
We’re gonna have to kick some of this
back to the circle you know

KE ITH
Let’s consider this unreported income

LANCE
Not this time They saw you check out
And when you check out you never check
back in empty-handed
Behind them at the entrance to the tunnel-
SEVERAL TIMID FAMILIES
Have gathered They observe the shipment with hungry eyes

LANCE (cont ’d)
See Word spreads fast

KEITH
Don’t look at me They’re your people

Keith TURNS AWAY and retreats into his private tunnel Lance
begins passing out the food

INT KEITH’S PRIVATE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Keith slips a few food rations under his mattress He picks
up a journal marks off the date time contents and location
of his find

A LONG LIST OF SUPPLIES has been written out He crosses off
the items he found It’s some kind of laundry list And
1t’s almost entirely checked off

Keith closes the journal then turns his eyes to a single
PHOTOGRAPH mounted nearby an early 20th century print
some kind of log cabin in the Old West Smoke pouring from
the chimney

He stares at it for a long beat A peaceful retreat An
ideal Far from here

DISSOLVE TO

EXT NEW YORK CITY - SURFACE STREETS - MORNING

The sun rises over the empty streets of Manhattan Rats
crawl through the wreckage searching for morsels of food
INT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Families sleep in packs along the walls huddled together for
warmth shivering in their despair

INT EQUIPMENT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Distant sunlight pours in from the grate

Keith and Lance are doing repairs on the Bradley tank A young
boy in a PAC-MAN t-shirt sits nearby basking in the far away
sunlight An old Walkman is around his neck but we can’t

tell if it works or not His name is ROBBY ROBBY

Lance kneels down in front of Robby and holds the boy’s
Walkman

LANCE
See this It’s all they want It’s got
parts inside and they move The
machines can only see stuff like this
Not human parts That means they can’t

Robby takes off his Walkman and casts it away like it’s a
ticking bomb Lance laughs

Just then FOOTSTEPS in the corridor behind them Keith
slides out from under the tank

KEITH

KEITH

Robby turns and runs off down the corridor Keith picks up
his 45mm off the floor He points it at the darkness just as-

The four-lane highway has been totally blocked by scrap
metal used cars parts of buildings old police barricades

PATROL GUARDS wearing Kevlar and night-vision goggles patrol
the area silently Heavy artillery explosives ammunition
planted all around These are Dukane’s men

Above the tunnel entrance a shanty-town of mobile homes has
been established Men women children resting inside
illuminated by fires Just then an ALARM SIREN goes off

Around the corner from the tunnel entrance a parking lot
contains several HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES all-terrain machines
that Dukane uses to get around

One of them is the MONSTER TRUCK we saw earlier

A WATCHMAN patrols nearby Suddenly from the darkness
behind him-

TWO HANDS

Take him by the shoulders and toss him into the side of one

Dukane’s men fire off another flare over Keith’s tank Still
no response from inside

On the other side of the barricade a CONVOY OF SIX GUARDS
approach the vehicle Assault rifles pointed safeties
released Dukane stays in the back rifle in hand

The men surround the tank One of them goes to the rear

GUARD
Sir You gotta see this

The rear hatch is open showing that NO ONE IS INSIDE
Except a single NOTE duct-taped to the door Dukane pulls
it off and reads

“BORROWING YOUR RIDE OWE YOU ONE K”

DUKANE
What the hell-

VROOM

Just then they are blinded by HEADLIGHTS as a barricade
breaks down behind them and the-

MONSTER TRUCK

Flies over the embankment landing on the street and pushing
through the debris over the highway It soars past them
giving Lance just enough time to lean out the window and wave
at Dukane

DUKANE (cont’d)
Son of a bitch

Keith floors the accelerator emitting a powerful ROAR as the
truck picks up speed literally riding over the wrecked cars

and other barricades leading to the tunnel

Guards open fire but the bullets glance off the heavy armor
Allura watches a bullet CRACK THE WINDOW next to her

ALLURA
Is this your idea of safe passage

KEITH
There’s always risks right

INT LINCOLN TUNNEL - WESTBOUND - CONTINUOUS

WHAM

The truck pushes through the final barricade and accelerates
into the depths of the underwater tunnel Now it’s free and
clear The road is hauntingly empty

BUZZING NOISES

Behind them Keith checks the side view mirror to see
SEVERAL MOTORCYCLES in hot pursuit Uzis firing bullets
spraying the rear of the truck

Keith glances at Hunk then at Allura

KEITH
All right let him go to work

Allura nods at Hunk who climbs out the cab of the truck into
the flatbed rear where he grabs an ASSAULT RIFLE and OPENS
FIRE on the motorcycles

One by one they spin off in every direction One hits the
wall and bounces back knocking into the others and sparking
a cataclysmic crash Bikes and bodies fly everywhere

Hunk spends the ammunition and discards the rifle Keith and
Lance regard each other in amazement

EXT LINCOLN TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Dukane watches his men limp out of the tunnel His face is
contorted into a mix of rage and humiliation One of his

guards approaches

GUARD
You want us to go after them

DUKANE
(after a beat)
No They’re already dead out there

DISSOLVE TO

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - EARLY MORNING
The sun rises over the horizon

The monster truck moves slowly through a suburban street

Or what was once a suburban street Now it looks like the
hollow remains of a quaint neighborhood in the aftermath of a
total apocalypse

Roofs have caved in Mailboxes long since discarded
Windows broken in the aftermath of looting Dogs run freely
through the yards gnawing on dead birds living as they
would in the wild No signs of human life

Keith steers the wheel while Hunk stands at the gun turret
overhead In the back Lance is going through machinery that
Dukane has installed He glances out the window

LANCE
I grew up in a neighborhood just like
this

Then he sees something among the equipment A radar console
connected to an old flat-screen monitor

LANCE (cont’ qd)
No shit Hey Keith check it out
Dukane’s thieving my work So much for
feeling guilty about lifting his ride

ALLURA

Keith stares sadly

LANCE
Hey Keith didn’t you fight in the war

Keith self-consciously rubs an old military tattoo on his
arm A Navy Cross He keeps his eyes on the ship

KEITH
Nobody fought in that war

EXT RURAL HIGHWAY - EVENING

The monster truck rides on the shoulder past a blocked
highway lined with old cars An entire civilization just
left them there and disappeared

EXT GAS STATION - EVENING

Lance pulls the truck next to a series of gas pumps and
everyone gets out Keith checks the diesel fuel No luck
Long since empty Then he catches sight of-

A GAS TANKER

Rolled on its side nearby He climbs up the top and taps the
hull Something inside

KE ITH
Lance Find us a siphon

Hunk keeps his eyes on the wilderness surrounding them
DISTANT ROARS of RoBeasts

ALLURA
We’ve got to keep moving

KE ITH
Tomorrow Tonight we take a break

ALLURA
It’s not safe to stay out here-

KEITH
Sweetheart it’s not safe anywhere What
are you gonna do

She rolls her eyes and walks off

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT

The monster truck idles gently attached to a heat generator
that keeps the group warm as they cluster in a tight circle
around a hand-built fire

Hunk 1s beginning to nod off Allura leans up against him
Just then-

A BEEPING NOISE
Lance snaps awake groggily looking around Keith gets up
and climbs into the back of the truck Looks at the radar

monitor It indicates a DOT in their proximity

KEITH
Lance Kill the engine

Lance jumps into the car and pulls out the keys The car
slowly cuts off Allura and Hunk wake up too

ALLURA
What is it

Keith points to the treetops behind them We can see the
vague outline of an old ELECTRICAL STATION Everyone waits
in silence Until-

ONE OF THE POWER LINES SNAPS

And falls over Moments later-

AN ENORMOUS ROBEASTS

Steps clear from the forest planting its foot about twenty
yards away from where the group is resting Nobody dares

move or whisper

The RoBeast pauses momentarily scanning its RED EYES over
the area for technology

Allura glances down at the satchel she carries with her
Protectively pulls it closer Keith catches this makes eye
contact with her Now he’s curious

Rustling behind them Everyone turns to see-

ANOTHER ROBEAST

Emerging from the woods Its heavy metallic shape hulks
towards them seemingly not noticing their presence

Both RoBeasts stare at each other One of them opens its
mouth and emits-

A NOISE
Like a high-pitched sonic shriek Everyone covers their
ears The other RoBeast returns this noise with another

sonic shriek They go back and forth like this

Keith watches this with great interest They’re
communicating with each other

Pinally both creatures turn and go their separate ways
disappearing into the darkness The beeping FADES AWAY

Keith watches Allura in the dark

KEITH
What’s in the bag

Allura shoves the satchel into her jacket and goes back to
Sleep Keith smiles
EXT SOUTHERN COUNTRY ROAD - EVENING

The monster truck continues along rural roads its passengers
keeping vigilant watch on their surroundings

In the distance Keith can see what must have once been the
city of ATLANTA Smoke billows from the high-rises on its
skyline A modern GONE WITH THE WIND

EXT SMALL RURAL MAIN STREET - NIGHT

The truck comes to a stop in front of an old general store
Allura sleeping in the back lifts her head

ALLURA
Why are we stopping

KEITH
Breakfast

Keith climbs the steps to the store and heads inside

LANCE
What you guys ain’t hungry

After a long beat Allura and Hunk follow them

INT GENERAL STORE - NIGHT

Keith pans a flashlight through the empty aisles of food
searching for anything that might be left

A few cans of soup Long since melted ice cream Rotted
meat He finds a box of GRANOLA BARS and tosses it to Lance

Keith pauses in front of a postcard rack An image of a
sunny beach He takes it and stares at it longingly
Distant memories A happy place

Lance meanwhile is rummaging through an old supply closet
Childrens drawings on the walls Stickers various handheld
video games spread around It looks like someone was living
here Lance picks up one of the video games when he notices-

A LUMP

Beneath a pile of blankets nearby He reaches down and pulls
back the blankets just as-

A LITTLE BOY

Emerges undernourished and exhausted clutching in his small
hands a CARVING KNIFE His name is SUZUISHI HIROSHI which
means “Tin Stone” but we will come to know him by his
affectionate nickname PIDGE Lance backs out of the closet but Pidge comes at him with
the knife

LANCE
Hey

Keith Allura and Hunk surround them Pidge darts the knife
back and forth between them silently threatening them not to
come closer

ALLURA
Careful

Finally Lance grabs his wrist wrestling with him until he
knocks the blade loose Hunk roughly picks Pidge up and
holds him in a bear hug while the boy kicks and writhes

LANCE
Kid’s possessed or something

ALLURA
He’s afraid

Allura pushes Keith and Hunk away and goes straight to Pidge
When he looks into her eyes he STOPS STRUGGLING
Something about this beautiful woman calms him down

ALLURA (cont’d)
See That wasn’t so hard was it

Keith regards the supply closet Pidge really did an amazing
job at making this place look like a child’s room

ALLURA (contd)
He’s coming with us

KEITH
Hey we don’t have the space

ALLURA
We’re not just leaving him behind

KEITH
He survived this long didn’t he

Allura glares at Keith Finally he relents putting his
hands in the air and walking off

KEITH (cont’d)
Fine Whatever

EXT SOUTHERN BORDERLANDS - DAY

What was once the long fence between Texas and Mexico is now
littered with bodies and debris Birds feed on the remains
Some areas have had holes cut into them

The monster truck drives by Allura and Pidge sit in the
back She’s working on cleaning him up

LANCE
IT don’t get it Ain’t nobody surviving
worth a cent out here People go to the
cities just so they can have a chance at
hiding together But this kid sticks
himself in a closet and he’s okay

Keith doesn’t respond

EXT MEXICO BORDER - DAY

The truck makes a left onto a long empty highway Far fewer
cars here

EXT BORDER GATES - EVENING

Keith slows the truck down They are approaching heavy
traffic and not the moving kind There doesn’t seem to be
anyone here at all Up ahead they see a long row of booths
with a dilapidated sign reading

“WELCOME TO MEXICO”

Allura looks out at it nervously

KE LTH
Got you there as promised

ALLURA
Were not there yet Be careful

Keith pulls off over the shoulder and they drive past a
series of downed booths entering the Mexico side around all
the stopped traffic

Then as they hit the other side they begin to notice
LIGHTS

Emerging through a distant fog in front of them All ina
line like an enormous city Like something out of

Apocalypse Now It’s surreal

ALLURA (contd)
Kill your lights

KEITH
T£ I kill the lights we move blind

ALLURA
Trust me you don’t want to announce
yourself here

Keith listens in the dark

SOUNDS OF A DISTANT CROWD Rioting Total chaos fThen

Hundreds of them All standing together holding torches in
their hands looking hungrily at the headlights approaching
them Waiting for stragglers to pass through Human
depravity at its lowest form

ALLURA (cont’d)
(rising fear)
Hunk Problems

Hunk grabs his shotgun and checks for ammunition

LANCE
What the hell is this

ALLURA
Floor it

Keith puts the truck into gear when suddenly-
THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR RIPS OPEN

People are already on top of them surrounding the truck
reaching in on all sides and pulling the group out Keith
struggles against enormous attackers but can’t do anything
to stop being thrown out of the truck

Lance kicks at aggressors but is not match for them either
Hunk grabs Allura and jumps out Pidge follows them

It’s total chaos An absolute cluster-fuck

The truck slows to a stop against a shoulder wall People
grab at whatever they can inside literally tearing the car
apart desperately looting it

On the ground Keith pulls out his 45mm and points it ina
wide circle People stand back but some still come at him
He finds Lance and picks him up Together they make their
way to Allura Pidge and Hunk who are swatting at attackers

ALLURA (contd)
Everyone stay together

Someone tries to grab the satchel around Allura’s shoulder
but she elbows him in the face roughly

They move through the crowd just trying to get through but
in the chaos they’re going to be trampled

One man abruptly pulls the shotgun out of Hunk’s hands and
Yrailses it towards him He’s about to fire when-

Keith pistol-whips him across the face The shot FIRES into
the air causing the panic to escalate Now it’s getting
seriously violent

Hunk pulls Pidge closer Lance and Keith stay back-to-back
keeping a gun on anyone who comes near Keith spins around
to find Allura only to see-

SHE HAS DISAPPERARED

Picked up in the chaos Now twenty feet away Someone SLAMS
INTO HER knocking the satchel bag out of her hands It hits
the floor and out rolls-

FIVE KEYS

Small ancient-looking but with some kind of modern edge to
them almost like alien artifacts Each of them has a
different color black red blue green and yellow

The keys slide across the pavement in several directions
People grab at them hysterically not sure what they are

Allura is on her hands and knees now desperately trying to
rein everything back in Keith picks her up

KEITH
Come on

ALLURA
No

She shoves him off Keith gets swallowed up by the crowd
again finding himself in a scuffle with an irate man trying
to get at his pistol

ON THE BLACK KEY gyrating slightly on the ground At first
we can’t tell if it’s just the stampede of feet or something
else

ON THE BLUE KEY also gyrating Except this one seems to
radiate some kind of an ENERGY FIELD

One by one each of the keys slowly begins to move PULLED
INWARDS drawn together like five separate magnets Each one
eludes people’s hands as it links up with the other finally
joining into-

ONE CENTRAL CORE

That exudes an even stronger energy field growing and
growing People in the crowd are beginning to notice

Behind them loose equipment begins to SHAKE LOOSE Keith
turns around just as-

AN ENGINE TURBINE

Flies over his head headed straight for the rapidly growing
energy core

Nearby several large tools as well as different pieces of
scrap iron all surge through the crowd towards the energy
core The people duck and flee as the core grows larger and
larger with each piece of mass it accumulates

ON KEITH watching in disbelief

The metal BENDS AND RE-FORMS itself into a perfect sphere
around the five keys identically to how we saw the RoBeasts
come together The core itself-

LIFTS OFF THE GROUND
Hovering in the air carried by some kind of pulsing energy

The entire core now begins to THRIVE like a heartbeat On
and off On and off Getting larger and larger until-

ALLURA

Approaches slowly Her hand is extended Zen-like calm
Her eyes close just as she reaches INTO THE ENERGY CORE and-

PULLS OUT THE FIVE KEYS
They separate into five parts once again Immediately
afterwards all the scrap metal in the core COLLAPSES and hits

the ground in separate pieces

The whole crowd is silent Some people get down on their
knees watching Allura with an inspired reverence

Keith doesn’t know what to think Who is this woman
Allura passes him and slowly walks back towards the monster
truck Lance Hunk and Pidge follow Soon Keith picks up
his backpack and trails them also As they walk through the
throngs of people

THE CROWD PARTS

To let them go As if they are actually afraid of them
They get back into the truck and drive off

EXT SMALL MEXICAN TOWN - NIGHT

Keith drives through a remote area beneath the bright moon
Here there are more signs of life in the smaller villages
Desolate but alive

Derelicts huddle in the shadows of small adobe-style houses
A child runs past them on the dirt road a SEMI-AUTOMATIC
RIFLE in his hands

Allura sits in the backseat staring out the window Keith
watches her from the front

KEITH
You can explain it now or explain it
later Either way I want answers

She says nothing Keith eyes her in the rear view mirror
Just then-

THE BEEPING NOISE

Emanates from the radar machine in back Lance climbs over
to check it

LANCE
Not good Moving in from the south
Keith cut the engine man-

ALLURA
No

Everyone turns to her Allura stares down at the satchel in
her lap whose contents are GLOWING from the inside

ALLURA (contd)
It’s not going to matter anymore
They’re after this

LANCE
What do you mean “they’re after this”
How can they be after anything

Hunk climbs over to the turret gun and fastens himself in
He scans the surroundings working the night-vision equipment
to see the horizon line So far nothing

A CRASHING SOUND BEHIND THEM

Everyone turns around to see a small house béing crushed by
the enormous foot of a-

SPIDER-LIKE ROBEAST

Red eyes trained down on the monster truck It SCREAMS OUT
into the night

Keith shifts the truck into fifth gear and accelerates
through the narrow pathways leaning on the horn as
stragglers dive out of his way He maneuvers to avoid
enormous barricades

The RoBeast pursues them at full speed its giant legs
spinning around each other one after another destroying
anything in its wake

Pidge climbs into the rear and looks out the window The
RoBeast swings out a talon that NARROWLY MISSES HIM Hunk
grabs Pidge and yanks him back into the front

Then he climbs into the turret gun and begins FIRING

Bullets chip away at the machine’s outer frame not doing
much damage

KEITH
Which way

ALLURA
Make the next left

Keith pulls a hard left a parking brake turn nearly
capsSizing the truck in the process At the apex of the turn
he floors the gas and accelerates again

EXT MEXICAN DESERT - EARLY MORNING

The sun RISES in the distance The monster truck crests out
of the city and onto a wide open dirt road leading into the

desert It’s moving at top speed And behind it

THE ROBEAST

Follows relentlessly covering more ground with a single step

to avoid its talons

Can’t you drive any faster

KEITH
I’m sorry was that not good enough for
you

EXT DESERT OUTSKIRTS - MILITARY COMPOUND - NIGHT

An oasis in the desert Several warehouses surrounding a
private adobe-style residence all contained behind heavy
walls Vehicles spare parts are strewn everywhere

SILHOUETTES OF GUARDS

On the parapets carrying heavy artillery They pivot their
weapons in slow circles vigilant eyes on the horizon

Two YOUNG MEXICAN BOYS are perched atop a nearby water tower
They watch as on the horizon-

THE TRUCK APPROACHES
Kicking up dust And beyond that-
THE ROBEAST IS GIVING CHASE

The boys exchange incredulous glances then RING AN ALARM
BELL The guards on the parapets look to the north where
the RoBeast is coming in One of them runs towards a tool
shed and pulls an ALARM LEVER Air raid sirens blare out

Keith turns to Allura

KEITH
- You want to fill me in on where we’re
going

She points straight ahead towards the compound from where-
RPG MISSILES

Soar over their heads having been fired by the compound
guards via shoulder-mounted launchers The missiles explode

in the sand all around the RoBeast inflicting some damage
but not doing much to stop it

Allura reaches into the satchel and fishes through the keys
finally finding the BLUE KEY which glows steadily

Keith stares at the front gates to the compound which are
blocked by heavy TRUCKS

ALLURA
Stop here We can’t lead it in

LANCE
What so we stay out here with that

Allura turns and looks at Hunk She gives hima long silent
look He nods knowingly as if he already senses what she’s
going to do

Keith slows the truck down near the outside of the compound
entrance Without another word Allura-

OPENS THE DOOR
And leaps out landing roughly on the sand and doing a quick

roll She picks herself up blue key in hand and SPRINTS
past the trucks blocking the entrance and into the gates

Keith watches incredulously

LANCE
Great She left us-

Suddenly-
THEIR TRUCK IS PICKED UP

Lifted into the air by the enormous talons of the RoBeast
It shakes the vehicle roughly

Keith Lance Hunk and Pidge are thrown around Lance falls
out the passenger side door but Hunk quickly GRABS HIM
holding him there with great strength Lance’s legs dangle
in the air Pidge helps pull him back in

The walls of the truck are beginning to CRUSH IN The
RoBeast is squeezing them like a tin can Keith stares out
towards the ground fifty feet below They can’t Jump

LANCE (cont’d)
It’s about to get tight in here

Hunk looks down at the four keys that Allura left behind
They GLOW in their satchel

Keith sees it too He doesn’t know what it means until-

THEY ARE SUDDENLY DROPPED

The truck spirals and lands on the sand rolling to a rough
stop Keith helps the others climb out bruised and
bloodied but surviving The RoBeast seems to have lost
interest in them entirely

And that’s when he turns around and sees what it’s focused
on

A GIANT MACHINE

In the shape of a colossal 50-foot tall LION assembled
entirely out of Earth-bound parts A C-130H tailgate has
been used for the mouth complete with traffic spikes for the
teeth The glass dome of an A6E Intruder cockpit has been
soldered onto the head All of this stands on top of four
legs refashioned from four construction excavator claws

Its called a LIONBOT A hack-assembled masterpiece A mech
you could build in your backyard

It dodges the RoBeasts swinging talons one after the other
moving with amazing precision considering its enormous size
Fach time the RoBeast attempts to swing at it it parries the
blow and then dodges closer

Keith can’t believe what he’s seeing Whatever this creature
is it’s capable of standing up to the RoBeasts

Finally the lionbot gets close enough to rear back on its
hind legs and LEAP UP towards the RoBeast’s pivot head It
grabs hold of what would be its neck with powerful jaws and-

TEARS ITS HEAD OFF

The RoBeast flails around for a brief moment trying to get
its bearings Then it-

COLLAPSES INTO A THOUSAND PIECES

Returning its shape to the debris and refuse it once was
The brain at its center the spherical ENERGY CELL rolls
onto the sand at the lionbot’s feet And then-

WHAM

The lionbot crushes it with an enormous talon flattening the
energy cell and stripping it of life

Then it lowers its head all the way to the ground right near

Keith and Lance who jump back not sure what this thing is
Moments later the mouth opens and out steps-

She was piloting it from the inside She and Keith stare off
for a long beat Neither knows what the other is thinking
But they’re interrupted by

CHEERING FROM BEHIND THEM

Standing along the compound walls above them are-

DOZENS OF FAMILIES

Old young male and female Coming from a variety of
different ethnicities Some are Hispanic some Arab some

Armenian still others are dark-shaded Africans They’re
like intercontinental Bedouins

And they’re elated This is what they’ve been waiting for

EXT BEDOUIN COMPOUND - DAY

Keith Lance Hunk and Pidge walk into the center of the
enormous compound which looks part residential part
industrial part military A Bedouin retreat

Mobile homes are arranged in a wide circle around the adobe-
style estate Grass grows on the lawns White picket
fences Children’s toys leaning against a shed Well-fed
dogs sniffing at each other Not much about this place
suggests the end of the world

Keith takes in the surreal scene as they approach the
mansion Beyond it in the junkyard

TWO GIANT DOORS

Clamp their metal jaws shut They seem to be leading to some
kind of underground tunnel Allura emerges from it wiping
her hands She parked the lionbot inside

Nearby an ARAB WOMAN and several young children emerge
scanning the group anxiously She sees Hunk and runs in for
a tearful embrace Hunk kisses each one of his children He
cradles their young infant

Keith Lance and Pidge find themselves surrounded by-

SEVERAL ARMED BEDOUIN GUARDS

Not at ease with the outsiders’ presence

KEITH
(to Allura)
Friends of yours

Just then from one of the tents emerges-
SVEN HOLGERSSON (40s)

Well-groomed intelligent European with impeccable taste a
Cigarette dangling from long thin fingers He wears a thick
industrial turtleneck An air of superiority

HOLGERSSON
Six months late Allura

ALLURA
All that time and you still barely got
the lionbots to work

HOLGERSSON
Was this your idea of an arrival
Bringing those things with you

ALLURA
Next time you can go out there on a
bullshit treasure hunt

Emerging from behind Holgersson is the embattled frame of
CORAN (60s) Unkempt grey hair hangs over his face He was
once a great warrior but time and tragedy have humbled him

CORAN
Allura

ALLURA
Coran

Allura goes to him for a long embrace Coran is overjoyed
He takes in every texture of her face Then he turns to the
confused Keith and Lance

CORAN

an enthusiastic hug

Without a word Allura opens up the satchel and shows Coran
its contents The five keys Coran’s jaw DROPS He can’t
believe what he’s looking at Tears begin to run to his eyes
as he takes the satchel from her

Holgersson and the soldiers look on with great interest

Coran holds up the keys to the Bedouins who raise their arms
in celebration

EXT BEDOUIN COMPOUND - RECREATION YARDS - AFTERNOON

Bedouin children play cricket in a small playground behind
the lavish home Armed guards stand watch on the parapets

Pidge takes in the scene like it’s something from an alien
planet He’s definitely not used to this

One of Hunk’s YOUNG DAUGHTERS approaches him and speaks in

some kind of pidgin of Arabic and Spanish A hybrid contact
language developed by these people after years of living

together in diversity

Pidge doesn’t understand what she’s saying Finally the
gixl takes him by the hand and drags him into the game

EXT BEDOUIN COMPOUND - COVERED PICNIC TABLES - CONTINUOUS

A private enclosed area where a group of Bedouin leaders
Coran Allura Hunk and Holgersson included all gather for
an important meeting

block them preventing them from taking part They watch
from afar

Everyone stops talking It’s clear they hold Coran in high
regard Allura and Holgersson stare off angrily

After a moment he follows her in

EXT BEDOUIN COMPOUND - RECREATION YARDS - DAY

Pidge chases a lodse baseball into some kind of elaborate
tool shed He looks around Dark hollow empty space He
hits a LIGHT illuminating before him

HUNDREDS OF SKETCHES

In varying languages some schematic some artistic some
downright incomprehensible Hieroglyphic annotations
Translations from some ancient source Heavy schematics
All of them depicting

FIVE LIONBOTS

Pidge curiously walks through the hanging drawings One
series depicts five lions merging together re-configuring
into a different form altogether Like a step-by-step
diagram of how they build a HUMANOID FIGURE What’s more

the figure carries a SWORD

Pidge gazes curiously at the blueprint for the sword We get
the sense he understands the mathematical jargon

civilization that grows by consumption
Namely the consumption of technologies
that a planet builds for itself

Coran paces back towards the keys picking them up They hum
quietly in his hands

CORAN (cont’d)
On Arus these keys were our life source
An energy so complex and so powerful that
the Drules would do anything to possess
it That is why they attacked our home
planet But the keys exert their own
free will They travel on their own
accord When Arus fell they traveled
across the known universe in search of a
safe home That brought them here to
your planet Twelve thousand years ago

LANCE
Hold on a second This guy’s got all the
greatest hits-

Holgersson turns back to his computer typing a few more
commands

SHRIEKING STATIC

Blares out through the speakers Keith freezes listens
closely It sounds like the noises we heard the RoBeasts
making the other night

KEITH
What is that

HOLGERSSON
To the untrained mind it’s just white
noise However I saw something else

He slows down the static to reveal an intermittent series of
CYCLING REPEATING NOISES It was concealed as static when
in actuality it’s a mechanical language Like a binary code
that you can listen to

HOLGERSSON (cont’d)
Articulated rhythm Recurring patterns
A complex mathematics but interpretable
given enough patience It’s a language
This was my first encounter with the
Drulies July 27th 1999

KEITH
You knew they were coming and you didn’t
warn anyone

HOLGERSSON (cont d)
Fortunately there was Coran and Allura
Given that they came from far away
places they were a bit more open-minded
So I financed their plans for mankind’s
second phase A better phase

Lance studies the computer monitors They break down the
language into visual intervals

LANCE
So what are they saying

HOLGERSSON
Chatter Updates Sometimes they send a
signal out to space wherever they came
from Before the first attack these
codes were exchanging pinpoints
Locations Learning our infrastructure
That’s why they went after power plants
and communications networks first Once
they got us out of the way they started
on the five keys Only problem is the
keys can’t emit a strong energy pulse
unless they join together so it’s taking
time to narrow the source down

KEITH
Brilliant way to search

HOLGERSSON
It is They’re persistent Relentless
Perfect

KEITH
Sounds like you admire them

Holgersson pauses for a long beat before speaking
HOLGERSSON

I admire their ability to listen It’s
something we lack

An empty hollow night Distant THUDS in the mountains The
ever-present RoBeasts

Bedouin guards pace back and forth scanning the horizon line
THUD

Remote but seemingly closer than we’ve heard it before One
of the guards perks up says something to another guard in
Sudanese

INT HUNK’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

THUD

Hunk sits up in bed His wife lies next to him not
stirring His children sleep on the floor

Was it a nightmare Or did he hear something

INT SLEEPING BUNKS - NIGHT

Many mobile homes strung together into an expansive if cozy
interior space Hundreds of people sleep on cots

THUD

Keith opens his eyes The king of self-preservation he
knows how to listen for possible threats And this is one
EXT BEDOUIN COMPOUND - NIGHT

Hunk puts on a jacket He speaks to the guards in pidgin
They point in the direction of where the noise is coming from
INT SLEEPING BUNKS - NIGHT

Pidge strolls through the corridors in his bare feet He
sips delicately from a small plastic cup of water

THUD

He peers out a window at the dark night sky on the outskirts
of the compound when suddenly-

CRASH

The glass shatters all around him and so does HALF THE WALL
An enormous ROBEAST LEG sweeps through the mobile homes
shattering them into many pieces jarring everyone awake all

at once

Pidge narrowly avoids being crushed He crawls back on his
hands and knees rapidly getting away as-

The full creature peers into the space Jagged metal face
Ruthless red eyes It unleashes a horrific SONIC SCREAM

Pidge covers his ears

EXT BEDOUIN COMPOUND - NIGHT

Hunk and the Bedouins hand out explosives and grenade
launchers as they sprint around the compound walls

EXT BEDOUIN COMPOUND - NIGHT

On the roof of one of the main warehouses a giant SPIDER-
LIKE ROBEAST is digging into the building with its enormous
talons

One of the Bedouins sets up an old Soviet mortar launcher

Keith does a quick circle checking their surroundings
That’s when he sees emerging from the rubble behind them

ANOTHER ROBEAST

Hey He brought his friends

They are surrounded by not just two but three four
RoBeasts They’re all converging on the compound

One of the Bedouins uses a key to unlock a box attached to a
kerosene lamp post Inside is a SINGLE RED LEVER He pulls
down on it and suddenly behind them-
THE SAND RISES UP

Giving way to the mouth of the enormous doors we saw earlier
An entrance to a giant underground tunnel

Keith stares at it his thoughts moving in a thousand

directions He turns towards his TRUCK loaded up with
supplies and still sitting on the tarmac

He’s got a choice to make

LANCE (cont’d)

He ignores Lance sprinting towards the trucks at full speed

But it’s too late The spider-like RoBeast emerges behind
the vehicles lifts a giant metal foot and-

CRUSHES THEM
With one step swallowing their masses into its own

Keith drops to his knees heartbroken and angered His
escape route just vanished

Lance comes up behind him grabs him by the shoulder

LANCE (cont’d)
We’ve got to go

Keith rises to his feet walking backwards with Lance still
not taking his eyes off the RoBeast as it finishes off the
truck

Nearby Holgersson begins retreating underground

HOLGERSSON
Great while it lasted

Allura and Coran sprint past him

ALLURA
Come on

They join the hordes of families and soldiers hauling ass
towards the tunnel

Lance grabs Pidge on his way throwing him over his shoulder
and giving the boy a clear view of the DESTRUCTION behind
them as they run

Elsewhere Hunk is carrying an injured soldier with him while
another Bedouin fires an assault rifle haphazardly towards a
RoBeast coming towards them

Hunk yells something in Arabic and turns to face the soldier
when he sees-

THE ROBEAST PICKING THE MAN UP

He swings wildly through the air caught in the creatures
grip and then abruptly CRUSHED as if he were a sheet of
paper Hunk watches in disbelief

The RoBeast leers downwards coming towards Hunk and the
other injured soldier who lies on his back It POUNCES

Hunk grabs the man’s hands pulling at him with all his
strength He looks into his eyes An old friend A fellow
warrior He’s a goner and they both know it

Finally Hunk makes a grim resolution The Bedouin nods his
agreement Hunk reaches to the man’s BANDOLIER and pulls the
pins from several HAND GRENADES mounted on his chest Then
he lets go allowing the RoBeast to pick the man up in its
colossal hand just as-

BOOM

Its hand BLOWS OFF

The RoBeast SCREAMS OUT and cradles its metallic stump of an
arm For a moment it doesn’t know what to do

EXT BEDOUIN COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

Hunk sprints towards her while the RoBeast momentarily
focuses its efforts on PLUNGING ITS ARM into the building’s
wreckage to REGENERATE ITS MASS from the debris

Within a few seconds it’s got another hand Good as new
Like a lizard’s tail It chases after Hunk once again

INT UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Hunk passes the doors pushes Allura out of the way and
pulls down on another lever which causes the blast doors to
begin to CLOSE But just as they are about to seal shut-

A ROBEAST ARM

Sticks through the narrowing gap and GRABS ALLURA by the
foot dragging her towards it She’s about to get taken away
entirely when-

WHAM

The doors clamp shut crushing its arm in the middle and
shattering into hundreds of pieces of shrapnel and debris
The hand that was gripping Allura falls apart also

Coran runs up to her

CORAN
Are you all right

She nods

Meanwhile Keith looks around and finds themselves standing
inside

AN ENORMOUS INTERIOR SPACE

Like a giant airplane hangar built underground All around
the iron-strutted walls are various tools and pieces of
industrial equipment Imagine someone’s auto body garage
times one hundred We’re talking heavy duty gear

The Bedouins embrace friends and family members who they’d
been separated from Hunk finds his wife again and’ takes her
into his arms

The RoBeasts bang against the heavily-reinforced doors from
the outside

KEITH
What are those walls made out of

Holgersson pulls a lever on a nearby wall and-
SEVERAL HALOGEN LAMPS

Turn on overhead illuminating another vast hangar space
Keith and Lance follow him inside Pidge stays nearby
Allura and Coran stay on the periphery

HOLGERSSON
I financed the reconstruction of this
hangar with money from my liquidated
assets A few months before the
invasion Gave us a place to operate
with complete privacy Which was very
important considering our project

At the back of the room COVERED IN TARPS are-
FIVE ENORMOUS LIONBOTS

Allura’s blue lionbot is one of them but it now stands
flanked by four others each one with a hand-painted color
scheme Red black yellow and green

KEITH
Great I think I had a toy like this
when I was a kid )

Pidge climbs onto the green lionbot and stares inside the
cockpit An elaborate series of complex controls all built
from car parts and other electronics

CORAN
Five machines Lionbots On their own
they are powerless devoid of the
strength to fight the Drules But
together with the power of the keys
they will form something else entirely

God assigned the task of rebuilding
humanity after the flood He sent him
into the forest to find wood for his Ark
After Noah had done so he asked God
“Why have I journeyed into the forest
but to retrieve only cypress wood What
purpose will it serve” And do you know
how God responded

“Build me an Ark and I will show you
your future”

backed up several times over-

HOLGERSSON (0C)
The generators didn’t fail Coran

Everyone turns around to see-

HOLGERSSON

9mm pistol in hand standing behind them with the barrel
pointed straight at Coran He looks nervous out of sorts

Like he hasn’t slept

HOLGERSSON (cont’d)
You did

ALLURA
Sven what the hell are you doing

Holgersson presses the gun closer against Coran’s head

HOLGERSSON
Step away from the system

HUNK
You will get us all killed

HOLGERSSON
I’m getting us out of here alive The
way we should have from the beginning

Holgersson types a few commands onto the keyboard A low
humming noise We watch on the monitors as

THE BLAST DOORS BEGIN TO OPEN

Slowly but surely Shadows movement on the other side The
RoBeasts are eagerly waiting for an opening

HOLGERSSON (contd)
(to Allura)
Go get me the keys

Hey are you kidding What do you think
they’re gonna cut a deal with you

Allura-

Keith makes his move He sidesteps Holgersson knocking him
to the ground and pushing Coran out of the way They
struggle for possession of the gun

BANG

A bullet goes off and splinters the control panel next to
where Lance is standing

Keith slams Holgersson in the face but can’t reach the
pistol in time as-

ANOTHER SHOT

Goes off this one not splintering the control panel Keith
wraps his fingers around Holgersson’s neck and-

SLAMS HIS HEAD
Against the ground again and again knocking him unconscious
and finally causing the weapon to drop out of his hands He

Sits up wiping sweat from his forehead when he sees behind

Coran reaches to her hands and takes them in his own
Squeezing them with all the strength he has left

CORAN

His eyes whiten His grip lessens Hes gone

Allura can’t believe what she’s seeing She wraps herself
around his body caked in blood not even noticing

KEITH
We’ve got to go now

Hunk turns his eyes towards the long corridor leading to the
tunnel entrance He can hear the RoBeasts getting closer
He quickly reaches down and SLAMS THE ALARM SIREN just as-

THE CEILING EXPLODES ABOVE THEM

Large blocks of concrete tumble to the floor Allura and the
others take cover Some mén are not so lucky getting
crushed under the metal reinforcement rods that rain down

Lance helps Hunk climb out from under the rubble Everyone
looks up to see as TWO COLOSSAL HANDS reach through the
gaping hole and peel the ceiling back further revealing-

A GIANT ROBEAST
Peering its snout into the hangar like a bear that just

discovered honey in the beehive It emits its trademark
SONIC SCREAM

Hunk and some of the Bedouin soldiers open fire Armor-
piercing bullets shred away at parts of the RoBeast’s
metallic face Not making a difference It rears back then
regathers its strength and peels back the ceiling further
giving it enough space to DROP INSIDE

Behind it two other RoBeasts appear from the tunnel
entrance They’re coming in from all areas

One of them arches its back to the ceiling and in all-out
rage sweeps its tail across the floor picking up dozens of
Bedouin warriors and-

TOSSING THEM

Hunk dives out of the way narrowly missing its wake as the
others are smacked violently against the wall and killed

Keith reaches down to Allura

Well we got them working

Allura looks at him incredulously Then she stands leaving
Coran on the floor behind her Says a last silent good-bye

HOLGERSSON (0C)
Don’t

They look up to see Holgersson sitting up bleeding from the
-head but still holding the 9mm which Keith dropped in the
chaos Pointed straight at Allura

She stares back at him with fearless steadfast eyes For
just a moment we think it might be the end of the road when-

WHAM

A RoBeast foot suddenly comes crashing down on top of him
Allura and the others don’t even have time to react The
creature sweeps its red eyes down over them about to move in

until-

IT SCREAMS AND FALLS AWAY

Something has leapt onto its back and is apparently causing
it extreme pain The RoBeast reaches around and swats at the
attacker finally giving us a clear angle to see-

THE GREEN LIONBOT

Chewing on the RoBeast’s innards with its powerful jaws
sending shrapnel everywhere It’s a true vision of beauty to
see this machine at work Despite its cumbersome
construction it really moves fluidly

It lands confidently on the ground with four legs Squares
off Above two more RoBeasts stick their heads through the
celling

Keith and Allura watch in amazement

HUNK
Who is piloting that

Lance stares at the green lionbot closely That’s when he
sees through the glass cockpit window

PIDGE

Keith glances at Allura She allows her body to accept the

The blue lionbot LEAPS UP OUT OF THE HANGAR Like some kind

Moments later the yellow lionbot jumps as well

Keith squeezes the handles closes his eyes and-

FLIES UPWARDS

they have The RoBeasts fight back in teams trying to
surround them and pull them apart limp from limb Shards of
metal fly everywhere

Keith finally succeeds in snatching Pidge’s lionbot in his
Giant talons and-

CARRYING HIM TO SAFETY

Linking up so that for a moment we see the glimpse of a torso
and a left arm coming together Hunk’s lionbot joins up to
form one of the legs bending its head upwards into a foot

Meanwhile in the cockpits a tremendous amount of input is
coming through the pilots’ helmets Memories flashbacks
literally their lives passing in front of them

father who beats him with a belt

Their memories are beginning to bleed into each other Their
minds fuse with the machine as one complete unit

Keith’s eyes SNAP OPEN He can’t take it The impact of
five minds becoming one blind faith trusting in others
it’s too much His lionbot wavers in its path struggling
under the weight of excessive input

tangle up They’re unable to break loose The fall is
disorienting The horizon line spins around in every
direction Finally they-

HIT THE GROUND

And roll several hundred yards kicking up sand Electricity
pours out of their frames

Allura’s lionbot crashes nearby with a heavy explosion of
sand narrowly avoiding landing right on top of them

Above Keith brings his lionbot down near a sharp precipice

landing harshly scraping off metal and paint trying to gain
traction as the machine slides closer and closer-

TOWARDS THE EDGE

Just when we think he’s going to go over his claws DIG IN
stopping himself just inches from the cliff

Keith breathes a sigh of relief But this is eroded by the

A ROBEAST

Its spider-like legs straddling the lionbot

ROBEAST POV all it sees is motionless machinery Vague
energy pulses but the signals are too opaque to make out
anything like Allura or the single key she holds in her hand
She sits still until finally-

THE ROBEAST STOMPS OFF On with its search

Nearby about fifty yards away Lance and Pidge climb out of
their damaged lionbots

Lance is bleeding from the forehead nursing an injured arm
Pidge seems relatively unscathed except that he is
completely exhausted He gives Lance a reassuring thumbs-up

Behind them limping through the sand are Keith and Hunk
Keith supports Hunk over his shoulder

Hunk nods cringing as he favors his right ankle

Signs of a life that once was And

leaps up and GRABS ONE OF THE TENTACLES severing it

The RoBeast screams and plunges another tentacle through the
windows which wraps around the lionbot’s body and pins it to
the building

Just then a voice behind it on a LOUDSPEAKER-

HUNK (0C)
Hey

The RoBeast looks over its shoulder to see-
HUNK’S YELLOW LIONBOT

On top of a building an enormous shoulder-mounted cannon
trained on it

BOOM

The shot hits the RoBeast square in the chest literally
blowing a hole straight through the energy cell in its
center Fragments of the core tumble to the ground

The creature staggers slightly dropping Pidge’s lionbot and

taking a weak step towards Hunk before it COLLAPSES IN A HUGE
HEAP on the ground

Hunk and Pidge grin at each other

On the other side of the island near the Hudson River boat
basin a snake-like RoBeast slithers rapidly through the
streets chasing Allura’s blue lionbot Keith sprints a
parallel course on the rooftops looking down at them below

KE ITH
You’re running out of space down there

ALLURA
Not a problem

Suddenly Allura takes a giant flying leap sailing over a low
building and-

PLUNGING INTO THE HUDSON RIVER

The RoBeast dives in also forming fins out of its metallic
scales as it disappears beneath the surface

EXT HUDSON RIVER - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Allura’s lionbot’s talons transform into paddle-like objects
She swims at full speed through the dark ocean waters

Behind her she can see the vague glimpse of the serpent

Downtown near a tall skyscraper overlooking the water
Dukane and some of his soldiers wait by a series of radio
controls

DUKANE
In position waiting for your mark
EXT HUDSON RIVER - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Allura’s lionbot rapidly ascends towards the surface all the
while making sure the RoBeast is following her

ALLURA
Here we come on three two
EXT NEW YORK CITY - SURFACE STREETS - CONTINUOUS

She leaps out of the water and pulls up on her controls
taking the lionbot’s nose upwards and-

UPSIDE DOWN

Doing a giant loop so that when the RoBeast emerges from the
water it has no idea where she is

KEITH
Now

Dukane pulls down on a lever and suddenly-
BOOM

SHAPE CHARGES demolish the entire lower half of the
skyscraper causing it to SEE-SAW and-

COLLAPSE TOWARDS THE OCEAN

Landing right on top of the helpless RoBeast erushing it
beneath several thousand tons of steel

Keith perches his lionbot on the highway nearby
KEITH (cont’d)

(to Allura)
You okay

ALLURA

Good to go

Keith smiles And then suddenly behind him an enormous
RoBeast claw reaches out of the rubble and SNATCHES Keith’s
lionbot The creature emerges from the water now
transformed into something more humanoid and more enraged

Keith frantically tries to maneuver himself out of its grip
but all the lionbot can do is flail its legs in the air

ALLURA (cont’d)
Lance

LANCE
I’m on it

Lance’s lionbot leaps on the creature’s back from behind
digging its powerful teeth into the RoBeast’s neck It
screams out and tosses Keith’s lionbot into a nearby
building focusing its full attention on Lance

Keith cascades down the face of the building plunging in an
uncontrolled spiral towards the ground He closes his eyes
and grips the console trying to will the lionbot into a
steady position and just before he hits the ground

HE FLIPS

Landing right-side up his claws gripping the concrete on all
fours Keith exhales a sigh of relief

Hunk leaps over several buildings towards Lance and the
RoBeast when suddenly-

HE IS SNATCHED UP MID-AIR

By the colossal talons of an AERIAL ROBEAST Just like the
others except this one has wings It carries him high above
the buildings Hunk maneuvers himself so he is facing it
point blank and-

FIRES HIS CANNON

The RoBeast screeches and releases its grip causing Hunk to
free-fall He ignites his correction boosters soaring
upwards and leaping from rooftop to rooftop heading back
towards Lance and the other creature

He closes in on them all the while avoiding the aerial
RoBeast as it swoops down to grab him time and time again

Finally he leaps out past Lance just as the aerial RoBeast
swings down and with its razor-sharp wings-

SLICES ACROSS THE OTHER ROBEAST’S TORSO

The creature momentarily freezes Its hands drop and

suddenly the upper half separates from the lower half
landing with a colossal shudder The energy cell dissolves

into pieces also having been cut in half

Meanwhile the aerial RoBeast hasn’t even noticed what it has
done It continues to pursue Hunk Keith chases them along
the ground following until he is close enough and then-

LEAPING UP

On top of the RoBeast’s wingspan It screeches violently and
dives lower smacking into buildings in its attempt to toss
him off but Keith holds on for dear life

On the surface Dukane waves desperately at a group of humans
in an adjacent building

DUKANE
They’re coming

Keith almost loses his balance gripping the RoBeast wing
with one claw

KEITH
Don’t know how much longer I’m going to
be able to hold this thing

Lance leaps onto a high building and looks down at the scene

LANCE
Just a little bit longer

KEITH
How much longer

Keith and the RoBeast are fast approaching a corner where
Dukane and his soldiers wait

LANCE
And now

Keith suddenly leaps off of the RoBeast landing sideways
while the creature tries to gain altitude as it rounds a
corner and flies right into-

THE PATH OF AN OIL TANKER

Swinging like a wrecking-ball on a pulley between two
buildings

thousand pieces which rain down on the ground

The energy cell lands nearby unharmed until Lance’s lionbot
foot CRUSHES IT just like Keith did before

LANCE (cont’d)
And that is how it’s done

CELEBRATION ALL AROUND
Allura lands her lionbot and gets out next to Keith who has
removed himself from his cockpit also They are about to
embrace when HUNK ARRIVES

HUNK

(eyes on the sky)
Friends

ON THE HORIZON rising over it like a new moon 18s an-

Enormous energy cell

The massive sphere so large it nearly blocks out the sun re-

forms and then FISSURES once again subdividing into HUNDREDS
OF ENERGY CELLS -

Which rain down on the city all at once Like a colossal
hail storm

They EXPLODE on contact with the ground emitting a pulse so
powerful so violent that its shock wave knocks over anything
within a mile radius

Dukane begins herding people underground

DUKANE
Get down Everyone get back under

Some people are picked up in the concussion some manage to
find their way to safety

The buildings near where the energy cell exploded begin
BENDING AND WARPING sucked in by the enormous new core
The radius gets wider and wider spreading uptown towards the
lionbots as-

KEITH
Grab onto something

It’s everything they can do to not get pulled in After
clawing themselves to safety they watch the many large
pieces of buildings shape into-

HUNDREDS OF ROBEASTS

LANCE
Take them one at a time right

And then as if in answer to this question the RoBeasts
suddenly clump together and-

MERGE

Being molded by unseen hands assimilating their shapes into
a gigantic mass almost as large as the island of Manhattan
itself two legs a torso two arms and finally a
head

A MASSIVE UBER-ROBEAST

So large it stands hundreds of feet into the sky Far bigger
than any RoBeast we have ever seen

The uber-RoBeast trains its massive red eyes down on the
lionbots and narrows its glare

swing of its fist-

IT PULVERIZES AN ENTIRE CITY BLOCK

Scattering the lionbots every which way Keith and Lance
roll together to the ground just south of Central Park
Allura lands nearby

LANCE (cont’d)
We gotta make a move

Keith looks at Allura through his cockpit window Then he
reaches into the nearby compartment and pulls out-

THE BLACK KEY

KEITH
We’re going to need a bigger robot

Hunk and Pidge land behind them Everyone knows what this
means

HUNK
Impossible We do not have runway
clearance to get the right speed for
interlock-

Suddenly -

BOOM

Two blasts from Lance’s lionbot’s cannon and several
buildings along Sixth Avenue go toppling over giving them a

wide runway at least a mile long

LANCE
How’s that for clearance

Keith and Allura meet stares

ALLURA
You up for this

KE ITH
Absolutely

LANCE

Hell yeah Let’s make it happen

Keith gets up and begins running down Sixth Avenue Behind
him everyone picks up speed getting in formation

In his cockpit Keith pulls back on a lever The black key
slides into its alternate configuration

The lionbots take off and begin soaring through the air
They pull closer five separate parts combining into one
whole

Keith twists his handles and they sink deeper into the floor
re-configuring his cockpit and locking his chair into place
He stares at the monitor in front of him

KEITH (cont’d)
Infracells up

Their energy readouts rise across the board

Outside the machines start to gyrate with energy Keith’s
lionbot reshapes its legs receding into its body and its
head tilting downwards

KEITH (cont’d)
(watching the levels)
Megathrusters are go

BOOM

The lionbots suddenly ignite with more speed than we’ve ever
seen them take on before

On his right side Lance’s red lionbot also changes its tail
extending and acting as a joint to connect it to Keith’s
torso Pidge’s lionbot does the same

LANCE
It’s working

ON KEITH closing his eyes to handle the speed The memories
begin flooding back

And then Keith finally lets go He gives in to the spiritual
machinery once and for all The images in his head BLUR INT
ONE all their memories fusing and fading into-

THE MACHINERY OF VOLTRON bending and igniting with energy
WE ZOOM UP

Along this new creation’s body watching as metals circuits
and wires miraculously mold around each other forming a new
shape entirely

Their connected mass sails high over New York City slowly

beginning to resemble a human figure On Keith’s lionbot

the mouth suddenly SPLITS OPEN at the jaw revealing hidden
within it-

A MACHINE-LIKE FACE made of jagged steel and plate metal
with bright white eyes glowing deeply

On the ground Dukane and the soldiers watch in disbelief
He’s finally beginning to believe as well

DUKANE
Holy God

And as the energy field begins to clear we see it has left
behind a shiny resplendent illumination what was once
rusted metal and hack-assembled bolts have now become a
unified mass of gorgeous colors red black blue green
yellow and the unmistakable CHROME

The shape plummets to the ground somersaulting around
itself its energy field dissipating as the figure bends its
knees and-

LANDS

Feet first on the decimated ground of New York City It
stretches its legs and arches its back revealing its full
Size to be a few hundred feet fall easily matching that of

Then it spreads its majestic arms - lions’ mouths for hands -
and SMACKS THEM TOGETHER ready for a fight

Ladies and gentlemen this is VOLTRON

The RoBeast emits an ENORMOUS SONIC SCREAM shattering nearby
windows and then attacks

Voltron grabs it with his right arm clamping the red
lionbot’s jaws around the RoBeast’s neck and tossing it
Sideways where it topples over another building

The RoBeast tries to reach up with its left arm to take
Voltron on the way down but Voltron-

SLAMS ITS SHOULDER

So hard that it actually knocks off the arm which drops onto
the street below

After a moment of immobility the arm gyrates with energy and
morphs into a SMALLER IDENTICAL ROBEAST which wraps itself
around Voltron’s torso

Voltron picks up the smaller RoBeast in both arms and YANKS
IT INTO TWO PIECES tossing the discarded remains into the
East River

Meanwhile the larger RoBeast stands up and leans on the
rubble of the building it knocked over The debris is SUCKED
INTO ITS CORE enlarging its mass and allowing it to
regenerate another arm

It grabs Voltron by the neck picking him up over his head
and TOSSING HIM-

OFF OF THE ISLAND

Flailing wildly until he SLAMS into the GEORGE WASHINGTON
BRIDGE He becomes tethered in the heavy support cables

The RoBeast leaps after him Voltron snaps one of the cables
loose spinning it out like a whip and-

WRAPPING IT AROUND THE ROBEAST’S ANKLE

With one firm yank the RoBeast is pulled sideways splashing
into the Hudson River It flails about but finds its
footing Voltron grabs a piece of the fallen bridge and-

TOSSES IT

Towards the RoBeast which merely assimilates the bridge into
its mass Voltron tosses another piece and it does the same
This isn’t working

Finally Voltron leaps upwards into the sky igniting a
series of boosters at his legs sailing hundreds of feet in

the air The RoBeast jumps also Voltron braces himself for
a collision as they both-

SMACK AGAINST EACH OTHER

And push further into the sky up through the clouds higher
and higher struggling punching tearing at each other until
they finally pop up-

BEYOND THE ATMOSPHERE

Glimpsing the blackness of outer space itself then tumbling
back towards the Earth rolling over each other and-

LANDING ROBEAST FIRST

So hard that their impact creates a deep hole a crater
plunging further and further into the ground

Voltron uses his claws and feet to ascend upwards out of the
crater emerging-
EXT PARIS FRANCE - SURFACE STREETS - DAY

On an entirely different continent They have literally
flown around half the Earth

Voltron brushes debris off of himself The city looks much
like every other city we’ve seen War-torn ravaged on its
last legs On the streets below various SURVIVORS climb out
from their hiding places regarding with great curiosity this
enormous robot that does not look like the RoBeasts

Then suddenly behind him-

THE ROBEAST RISES OUT OF THE CRATER

Grabbing Voltron by the neck and yanking him sideways He
topples over sliding along the tops of old 19th century
buildings and landing right near the Champs-Elysees

The RoBeast takes two giant strides and leaps high in the
air about to pounce down on top of him when Voltron reaches

behind himself picking up the collapsed EIFEL TOWER and-

USING IT AS A SPEAR

So that the RoBeast impales itself through the chest

It screams out face-to-face with its adversary enraged and
in great pain Voltron holds the RoBeast like food on a
giant skewer Then it bends the creature over its knee and-

SNAPS THE ROBEAST IN HALF

Both parts topple to the ground Moments later they gather
themselves forming two identical but smaller RoBeasts which
then merge together and assimilate into the large one yet
again

Voltron swings the Eifel Tower like a baseball bat but the
creature grabs it and assimilates it once again Then it
delivers a PULVERIZING FIST knocking Voltron headlong into
the air

flailing about as he sails upwards into the clouds and
comes back down in-

EXT SINGAPORE - SURFACE STREETS - EVENING

Plunging into the depths of the Singapore Strait ocean He
surfaces and swims to shore

After a brief moment of peace we hear the sound of something
falling out of the sky The RoBeast is coming down

Directly to Voltron’s right is the crushed frame of the
SINGAPORE INDOOR SOCCER STADIUM He picks it up using the
Giant dome as a shield and-

RATSING IT OVER HIS HEAD
As the RoBeast comes down and SMACKS RIGHT INTO IT

Voltron drops the stadium and pulverizes the fallen RoBeast
with his fists punching clear through the creature’s
abdomen But now the RoBeast holds Voltron’s arm in place
and begins-

SWALLOWING IT INTO ITS MASS Trying to incorporate its
metals into its body

Voltron props up his feet pulling until he finally succeeds
at separating himself from the RoBeast

Facing each other from several hundred yards away the two
adversaries square off once again The RoBeast picks up the
stadium roof and uses it to fill in the gap in its chest

Can this creature ever be taken down So long as it can get

Voltron takes two giant steps and leaps in the opposite
direction soaring high in the air beyond the clouds
navigating himself away from the RoBeast

From below the streets the people of New York begin to
emerge Robby the young boy leads the pack staring up in

awe at their enormous savior

The RoBeast plunges down after him landing on top of Voltron
and pushing his face deep into the debris of the city

Voltron flails around reaching for anything he can That’s
when he finds what he came back to New York looking for

A GIANT I-BEAM

Connected to a series of electrodes and seemingly having been

given an enormous handle This is the weapon that Pidge and
Hunk were building

Voltron reaches out with his left hand and grabs on swinging
it back like a blunt object and knocking the RoBeast away
Then he rises to his feet holding the I-Beam in both hands
and -

EXT OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS

Spiraling out of control zooming upwards through the
atmosphere Voltron struggles to right himself He barely
has time to react before the RoBeast comes down again this
time going for the kill

It gnaws at his chest shredding apart pieces of metal going
for the humans inside Voltron kicks it away

They hover in the zero-gravity of space Once again facing
off

But this time Voltron’s got a new weapon He flips a charge
on the handle of the I-Beam causing the sword to-

IGNITE WITH LIFE

An electron field spins around it so powerfully that it
creates a FORCE OF STATIC ELECTRICITY A “blazing sword”

The RoBeast roars angrily and goes in for another attack
But this time Voltron raises the sword and-

SLICES ITS ARM OFF

Dissolving it in a mass of bits and particles which float
off into the depths of space

The RoBeast screams out and looks around to re-form its mass
But that’s when it realizes

there’s no metal out here Nothing to regenerate
The RoBeast’s red eyes GO WIDE It looks into Voltron’s
cold mechanical face And even though neither of these
machines has the capacity to speak we know exactly what
Voltron’s thinking

“VYou’re fucked”

The RoBeast fearfully backs away It barely has time to
react before-

And rips sideways across the creature’s torso He holds it
there allowing the energy pulse to surround the RoBeast so
pervasively that-

BOOM

It EXPLODES into a thousand pieces of scrap metal

Iridescent metallic particles float loosely in the zero
gravity of the Earth’s outer atmosphere They surround the

central core the weakened ENERGY CELL itself
Voltron picks up the core with one hand and-
TOSSES IT TOWARDS THE SUN

The energy cell gets further and further away finally
turning into an DISTANT EXPLOSION of blackness as it hits the
sun’s hot surface and is rapidly disintegrated

Voltron watches it with steadfast eyes Then he leans back
allowing himself to be picked up again by the Earth’s
gravitational pull and-

DESCENDING TOWARDS THE GROUND

As he gets closer he looks out - five sets of eyes staring
down as one - over the grand landscapes of the planet below

ON THE PILOTS INSIDE the individual humans whose minds have
fused into one giant entity
