INT PETER’S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

PETER BRETTER watches television alone in his dark
creepy apartment A fake MUMMY lies in the corner Vintage
magician posters and a giant creepy French Clockwork Orange
poster adorn the walls Cigarette butts overflowing
ashtrays and bottles of liquor crowd the table and a GIANT
PLASMA TELEVISION adorns one wall In the corner are a
guitar and keyboard

Peter sits smoking watching THE ISLAND with SCARLETT
JOHANNSEN THE COLONY IS ADDRESSED BY A MAN ON PLASMA
SCREENS THROUGHOUT THE COMPOUND

---Peter has made it so his computer is being mirrored on his
GIANT PLASMA He sits in front of his computer’s camera so
that his GIANT FACE is on the tv He is wearing a Jacket and
TIE

PETER
(mimicking THE ISLAND)
The lottery will begin in twenty
minutes The lucky winners will get
to smoke a gigantic joint

Peter chuckles to himself and lights a joint which he
watches himself smoke on TV He tries to make smoke rings

We pull back to reveal that he is wearing only the top half
of a suit and boxers

-- Peter’s watching the Red Shoe Diaries The part that
Duchovny narrates

-- Peter opens his fridge It has nothing in it except for
some old orange juice

-- Peter’s on his couch drinking old orange juice from the
carton smoking watching an informational about a treadmill

-- Peter’s on the phone

PETER (CONTD)
Yeah I don’t need the elliptical
Just the treadmill Thanks It’s
a Mastercard

-- Peter’s pulled the treadmill out of its box

-- It’s some time later The treadmill is covered in
ashtrays and various junk Peter’s on the phone
PETER (CONT’D)
Well that’s great Topher sounds
really cool I’m glad you’re
having fun I’m OK No I’m fine
Seriously I’m doing fine I gota
treadmill Yeah I miss you and I
cannot wait to see you Have fun
at the wrap party

Peter hangs up He then hits the treadmill on and watches
with little interest as a bunch of full ash trays half-
filled soda bottles and papers go flying off it

-- Peter sits on his couch drinking coffee watching Talk
Soup It goes to a commercial for “Comedy Mondays” and we
see a brief promo for “GRACE IS ACES” starring “Emmy Nominee
SARAH MARSHALL” Peter beams

PETER (CONTD)
That’s my girl

He addresses a Muppet style DRACULA PUPPET in the corner

PETER (CONT’D)
We’re gonna get to snuggle in only
twenty three days huh Vlad

-- Peter watches the Red Shoe Diaries again As he does so
he bounces a ball against Duchovny’s face

-- Peter’s asleep It’s 345PM The phone rings He lets
it go to answering machine

BRIAN (0S)

(answering machine)
Yo it’s your bro Pick up pick up
pick up pick up pick up

(sighs)
Since your lady’s not in for a
couple more days I was thinking
you could let me and Liz take you
out for a meal I know you’re
there Pick up pick up pick up
pick up

Peter ignores the machine

-- Peter’s alarm goes off The Cardigan’s “Lovefool” begins
playing Peter HOPS OUT of bed

-- Peter in a nice suit and nice shirt sits expectantly on
his couch The phone rings Peter answers it
PETER
Hey sweetie
(then)
Not for another week Oh No
that’s totally great Say hello to
everyone for me Love ya

Peter leaves the room and returns seconds later wearing his
old sweatpants and dirty T-shirt

INT SHOWER - LATER

Peter stands scrubbing and singing in a STRANGE OPERATIC
VOICE The phone rings He grabs a cordless next to the sink

PETER
Hello Hey Baby Welcome Home I’m
just in the shower singing I think
I’m zeroing in on Dracula’s point
of view Yeah of course come on
over Love you

(beat)

Hello Oh okay see you in a
minute

Peter hangs up and looks at the phone a bit concerned

INT PETER’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

A knocking at the door Peter comes out from the bathroom
dripping wet naked drying himself with a towel He opens
the door for his stunningly beautiful girlfriend SARAH
MARSHALL She enters as Peter continues drying himself
with the towel casually exposing his naked body

PETER
(big goofy smile)
Hey lover Just scrubbing up for
you

She can barely look in Peter’s direction
SARAH
Pete as you know I love you very
much But

Peter drops his towel

PETER
Are you breaking up with me
She looks down at the floor Then she nods Peter looks in
complete shock He sits down on the couch and tries not to
hyperventilate

SARAH
Why don’t you put on some clothes
and let’s discuss this

PETER
(already teary)
I can’t do anything right now

SARAH
(sweetly)
Honey I’m sorry

PETER
(starting to lose it)
What is going on I love you I
love you please don’t do this --

SARAH

Just put on some clothes --
PETER

Will that make you not break up

with me
Sarah touches Peter’s shoulder He roughly shakes her off

PETER (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m just oh god

Peter sobs so hard that he begins to choke on his breath

PETER (CONTD)
I’m in control I’m in control I’m
fine let’s talk Why

She starts to speak

PETER (CONTD)
Just tell me why

SARAH
(super rehearsed)
Pete as you know I love you very
much

PETER
You already said that Like in
exactly that tone
SARAH
(still super-rehearsed)
But I’ve felt for a long time that
we were growing apart and leading
different lives It’s not that I
don’t love you I do

PETER
(ignoring her)
I love you too Like so much

SARAH
And that’s really sweet It’s just
that I think my love for you
haschanged

PETER
Changed how

SARAH
Becomeweaker You know Like a
lotweaker It’s like you’re on
the dock and I’m in the lake and
I’m like “jump in the lake” but
you just keep staying on the dock

PETER
What I’11 jump in the lake

SARAH
I know you would but it wouldn’t
be for the right reasons

PETER
Why now I told you I’ve finally
figured out Dracula’s POV and you
dump me

SARAH
Now’s the time while your life’s on
the upswing

(then back to super

rehearsed)
While this is hard for me I
understand that it might be even
harder for you If you want to not
see each other for a while I
completely and totally understand

PETER

Who’s the guy Is there someone
else Someone from the movie
(MORE )

PETER (CONTD)
Please tell me it’s not Dax
Shepard

SARAH
No There’s no one I would never
hurt you like that

Peter begins weeping and moving towards her

PETER
If there’s no other guy it doesn’t
have to be over if there’s no
other guy it doesn’t have to be
over

SARAH
(tearing up a little)
I’ve thought about this a lot
sweetie

PETER
I haven’t seen you in so long
youve forgotten what we have and I
forgive you for that Just kiss me
one last time and I swear you’ll
remember

SARAH
I don’t know if that’s good idea -

PETER
Just please

Peter wipes tears and snot off his face and pulls Sarah
towards him He starts kissing her and desperately clutching
her Then he starts passionately rubbing up against her We
can tell she’s not into it

PETER
I love you baby Do you remember
now

Peter’s getting more and more into it
SARAH
(panicking)

There’s someone else

Peter pulls away and stares at her for as long as Universal
will allow

SARAH
I should probably go
She leaves

INT PETER’S APARTMENT - LATER

Peter sits on the couch with his younger brother BRIAN
BRETTER Three boxes of Camels sit in front of Peter
who smokes one as he drinks a fuzzy navel clearly not his
first

BRIAN
Are you sure you don’t want to eat
something with that

Peter shrugs indifferently Brian OPENS Peter’s fridge
There’s an old piece of moldy American cheese That’s it

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Your place has gotten really
disgusting I had no idea American
cheese could sustain mold

PETER
Can we please focus on the fact
that the love my life has just
dumped me It’s going to be OK
right

BRIAN
It will be But you’re the only
one who can make it better Clean
yourself up You’re like the
walking dead

PETER
BECAUSE IVE JUST BEEN DUMPED

BRIAN
You were doing great before Sarah
Honestly you’ve been on a downward
spiral ever since you two met

PETER
That is not true

BRIAN
Right out of the gate you wrote a
kick ass song for Graces you
hooked up with the star you were
on your way Then she took off like
a rocket and you sat on your ass in
this creepy theme restaurant of an
apartment
PETER
I’ve been working on my Dracula
musical

BRIAN

For five and a half years

PETER
Musicals are one of the most
complicated art forms There’s a
story and songs and --
(then)
I don’t understand why we’re even
talking about this

BRIAN
Because this is why Sarah dumped
you When I met Liz she wouldnt
date me Not because she didn’t
think I was a handsome and
intelligent man but because I
didn’t have my life together So I
quit pot I went premed I started
doing yoga and now we’re engaged

PETER
Youre like a fucking child bride

BRIAN
Easy now I’m not the one who made
Sarah sleep with Dax Shepard

PETER

(interrupting)
Get the fuck out of here I’m
serious Right now Get the hell
out here

BRIAN
Pete---

PETER
Get out Brian

Brian takes Peter’s drink away heads for the door He begins
to speak again

BRIAN
When you sober up Liz and I would
love to have you over for a BBQ

PETER
LEAVE
INT PETER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

covers He is sweating profusely and breathing in a way that
is best described as panting THE PHONE RINGS Peter glances
at the caller ID but does not answer

(answering machine)

INT PETER’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

was an alien trying to burst
through my chest for the past three
weeks so I thought Id get out of
town

SARAH
I know what you mean William and
I are here because we used that
coupon that I earned How was your
flight

PETER
I don’t know It was a flight I
ate peanuts

An awkward pause Peter finds the strength to look
and extend his hand William reaches out to shake

ANGLE ON Peter’s POV A series of EXTREMELY TIGHT
of William’s muscles flexing with the extension of

PETER (CONT’D)
Hello I’m Peter

at William

close ups
his arm

William shakes with a friendly smile He speaks with a slight

accent

WILLIAM
William It’s nice to meet you
Are you staying here as well

PETER
Actually William it doesn’t look
like

RACHEL
(interrupting)
I was able to book that room for
you sir four nights

PETER
You were

RACHEL
Yes sir the Kapua Suite

Peter looks at her confused but she offers back a confident

nod Peter goes along with it

PETER
Excellent And you say that’s one
of the nicer suites yes

Rachel is mildly amused at his posturing

RACHEL
Yes Mr Bretter I think you’1l
find it acceptable

PETER
Marvelous
(to William)
I am staying here as a matter of
fact Just a quick five-day trip

WILLIAM
Great Well if you’d like to have
dinner with us one of the nights

fine on my own
(to Sarah)
Good to see you Sarah

SARAH

She touches his arm and then walks away William in hand
When she is out of sight Peter nearly collapses

RACHEL
You okay

PETER
(very faint)
I’m fine I’m fine Look thanks
for bailing me out but I still
can’t afford the room
RACHEL
No one can It’s just for people
like Elton John or the kids from
that 70’s show I don’t think
anyone’s gonna be popping in to
stay there in the next four days
You can use the room you just
can’t let anyone know

PETER
(distracted)
Wow OK sounds good

RACHEL
You need a key card to activate the
electricity

PETER
Great

RACHEL
But I can’t give you one It’ll
register with the system I’m
giving you a janitor’s key instead
No room service no phone and
youll have to clean up after
yourself

PETER
Why are you doing this

RACHEL
She’s here with a guy already
That’s fucked up

PETER
(in agreement)
Right

Rachel hands him a key

RACHEL
Have a good stay

LUCKY” “I’M A RESPONSIBLE”

PETER

fucking Calvin Klein bullshit

BRIAN
That is a nightmare

PETER
I can’t believe she would cash in
that free travel voucher She
never uses any of that free shit --
do you know how many unused Razr
phones she has in her closet She
makes bank Why the fuck does she
need a free week in Hawaii

BRIAN
I don’t know it’s hard to turn
down a free trip But what you
have got to concentrate on is
getting control of yourself

PETER
Who’s side are you on

BRIAN
She is not cool There’s no doubt
about that But you have got to
get control of yourself

PETER
Are you kidding me My ex-
girlfriend of five years is here
With her new boyfriend

BRIAN
Why don’t we think of solutions
Arent there any other hotels on
the island

PETER
She saw me check in If I left it

WILLIAM
Really I think it would have been
more awkward not to ask

SARAH
Are you kidding me What is wrong
with you

WILLIAM
I don’t know we’re all adults I
certainly wasn’t trying to make
things any more uncomfortable

SARAH
William it’s been three weeksI

physically not see each other for a

WILLIAM
No Ha No this is my real accent

covered bulletin board filled with polaroids of drunken
female patrons flashing and sticking out their tongues He

him IT IS A POLAROID OF RACHEL FLASHING HER BREASTS MICHAEL

The band brings their song to an end and the lead singer
speaks into the mic

LEAD SINGER

special guest from the mainland
Singing a number from his Dracula
Musical please welcome Peter
Quint

Scattered applause Peter looks at Rachel and shakes his
head resigned He heads to the stage and takes a seat behind
the piano

PIANIST
Be nice to her

Peter sits but leans into the mic before he begins

PETER
Really I can sing something else
I think out of contextthe
Dracula voice might be

RACHEL
(calling out)
DRACULA MUSICAL

She claps and the crowd joins in

PETER
(nervous )
Alright

Peter begins playing the piano He signs in a strange
Dracula voice

PETER (CONT’D)
Its getting kind of hard to
believe things are going to get
better But having you here now I
see things are going to be
brighter Feeling you here now I
know I just might make it through
Loving you this long has made me
believe in forever And with you
these dreams Ive forgotten might
some how come true

Just as the bar starts to get used to the weird song the
music takes a dark turn and Dracula seems to get angry

PETER (CONT’D)
And when Van Helsing comes calling
I swear to the Lord I will slay
him Hed take you from me but I
swear I wont let it be so His
blood will run down my face once he
is decapitated His head on my
mantle is how I will let the World
knowhow much I love you

Peter and Rachel make eye contact She smiles a smile we
haven’t seen before Their gaze lingers as MICHAEL has a seat
at her table They speak while Peter is singing

MICHAEL
Weird song But he’s cute

RACHEL
I don’t know He’s kinda weird

PETER
Die Die Diel
(sadly)

standing ovation Peter is touched that Rachel is clapping
for his obviously strange performance They share a smile

EXT WAIKIKI - THREE AM

Waikiki However Waikiki at 300 am is not a romantic
place The street is peppered with drug dealers and
prostitutes many of whom are transvestites Every few feet
Peter waves off being given a flyer for Strip Clubs

RACHEL
So yeah I pretty much quit my
life and moved out here for him
Mr Perfect Surfer Stud Thought

PETER
So what happened

RACHEL
After about three weeks he told me
he wasn’t ready for a commitment I
moved out the next day he left for
the tour and that’s that

PETER
What an asshole

RACHEL
He was just a boy I can see that
now Though I would like very much
to beat the shit out of him

Peter chuckles They pass a STRIP CLUB THE DOORMAN tries to
coax them inside

INT KAPUA SUITE - NEXT MORNING

Peter wakes in bed with a smile Sun streams through the
windows He looks at the clock 600 AM

INT BREAKFAST BUFFET - LATER

Peter eats his breakfast at a table that is RIGHT NEXT TO THE

KITCHEN We watch him as he eats though every couple of
seconds our view is blocked by the swinging doors

EXT BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Peter heads over to the surf shack where Jack is dealing with
a young kid and his dad He spots Peter

JACK
Hey Bro-sepe What’s up

PETER
Wanted to see if you were available
for a lesson but looks like youre
busy

JACK
Wanna fool around on a kook-board
It’s easy

EXT BEACH - LATER

Peter walks backwards in his fins to the shorebreak He waits
for the next whitewater then clumsily flops onto the board

EXT OCEAN - MOMENTS LATER

Out of breath Peter finally paddles up to the surfer who
sits on his board waiting for the next set It is WILLIAM
shirtless and fit

WILLIAM
Hello there

PETER
Jesus Christ You surf too

WILLIAM
No never tried It’s easier than
it looks though Growing up I was a
proper little skateboarder so my
balance is pretty good

PETER
Well good seeing you I’m just
gonna paddle a little more try to
get some exercise

Peter begins paddling with purpose Sadly he is working
against the current and does not move at all

WILLIAM
I owe you an apology For the
other night at dinner I totally
overstepped my bounds You need to
move at your own pace and I’m
sorry for trying to force the
issue

Peter is momentarily taken aback by William’s compassion

PETER
No prob

They bob for a moment in silence

WILLIAM
It’s just that when Brittany and I
got divorced it was so amicableI
guess I just wish that good fortune
upon everyone

PETER
You were married

WILLIAM
Oh yes Seems like a lifetime ago
now but yes We’re the best of
friends I met her on my program in
England when I was twenty She
used to spin at Chocolate Sauce

PETER
Wow And whatwhat “program” was
this

WILLIAM

It was called “Fancy Boys”
Peter tries not to chuckle

WILLIAM (CONTD)
Yes I know Tough title Believe
me I didn’t audition for it Got
“discovered” in a coffee shop One
minute some older gentleman is
asking me if I want to be an actor
the next I’m all over the BBC
playing How’s your Father with the
Constable’s son Funny how things
go

Peter and William share a laugh then silence Finally

PETER
(begrudgingly)
I don’t blame you for anything

WILLIAM
I’m glad And for whatever it’s
worth I thought you guys had ended
things before I ever

Peter tenses a bit

PETER
Hadn’t we

William gives Peter a look which conveys volumes

PETER (CONTD)

(growing tense)
Jesus man I believe you’re trying
your best but for a British dude
you sure are low on tact

A large wave is approaching William sees the wave and
begins paddling to catch it

PETER (CONTD)
(tentative)

That wave looks a little big Id

be careful

WILLIAM
It couldn’t be worse than this
conversation I think I’1l manage

William positions himself perfectly and is swept up by the
wave Nimble as a gazelle he leaps to his feet Peter
watches with disdain as he rides towards the shore a bronze
Adonis William turns back and gives Peter a smile which is
not returned ThenBANG William’s board smashes into a
rock sending him crashing beneath the wave Peter can’t help
but laugh He waits for William to surface And he waits And
waits William does not emerge from the water Instead only
the top of William’s board can be seen protruding vertically
from the water a sure sign he is trapped below

PETER
Shit

Peter ditches his board and begins swimming for William

INT UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Peter follows the board’s leash down towards the reef and
sees William panicked and struggling leg trapped in the
reef He reaches out a hand towards Peter who grabs it and
tries to pull him up William does not budge but lets out a
silent scream of pain After a furious effort William’s leg
breaks free from the reef and the two head for the surface

EXT OCEAN - CONTINUOUS
The pair emerge from the water

WILLIAM
AAAHHHH

PETER
Sorry Can you paddle

WILLIAM
I think so

The two head towards shore William paddling Peter swimming

EXT BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

Peter helps the hobbling William to shore where Jack is
giving the young kid pre-surf instruction He runs over

JACK
You alright there brother

WILLIAM
I can barely move my leg

JACK
Well I can see why

He points at Williams leg and we now see that a large CHUNK
OF REEF is stuck in his leg protruding through the skin

PETER
(gagging)
Oh my god

JACK
You better pull that out

William tries but even bending is excruciating

WILLIAM
I can’t do it

Peter turns to Jack

JACK
(calm)
I’m not a doctor legally
Besides he could sue me and the
hotel
(to Peter)
You do it

PETER
I’m not good withstuff like
this

WILLIAM
Please Peter get it out of me

Peter winces and grabs the exposed coral

PETER
Ready

WILLIAM
Do itAAHHHH That hurts

PETER
It’s almost out

Peter is oddly enjoying pulling the coral out

JACK
It looks like you should pull it
the other way

PETER
Oh right

Peter pulls it in the other direction and wrenches out the
rather large piece of coral as William screams in pain They
all look down at Williams leg which actually seems okay

WILLIAM
Thank God It actually doesn’t look
too bad

Then BLOOD POURS FROM THE WOUND Peter turns white

PETER
(weak)
I don’t feel so

AND HE FAINTS

INT HOTEL ROOM - LATER

Peter wakes up laying on a large bed and sees Sarah standing
over him concerned As he slowly regains his consciousness
he smiles at her and glances to his side There next to him
lays William leg bandaged and asleep

PETER

(groggy )
What’s going on Is he OK

SARAH
Hell be fine They gave him some
stitches and painkillers You
passed out The doctor said you
were dehydrated Have you had any
drinks today

PETER
Only like twelve Mai Tais but
those have juice in them

(then)
(MORE)

PETER (CONTD)
Why am I talking to you Your
boyfriend just apologized to me for
sleeping with you before we broke
up

SARAH
Oh Christ I’m sorry Just relax
for a minute You shouldn’t be up
and around

PETER
I don’t want you touching me

They share a long look and Sarah’s chin starts to tremble

PETER (CONT’D)
What the fuck happened Sarah
I understand it’s over I really
do I just would like to understand
what I did to make you cheat

SARAH
You didn’t do anything Pete You
were great

PETER
Not great enough to keep other
dicks out of you

SARAH
I will never stop caring about you

Though the conversation grows in intensity both try not to
wake William

PETER
I know and we’ll be friends forever
etc and so on Can we please just
cut the bullshit You owe me that

SARAH
Fine Because Peter it got hard to
keep taking care of you when you
stopped taking care of yourself

PETER
Oh c’mon

SARAH
For God sakes you were drunk at
the 1000 am Yoga class

FF e

Peter takes a deep breath and begins his leap from the
waterfall However about halfway through he loses his nerve
and his body seizes His feet do not jump but instead slip
out from under him He slams down hard onto the edge of the
cliff He manages to grab onto a tree root before plummeting

PETER
I’m okay I’11 just let go

RACHEL
No It’s like really dangerous
now If you fall straight down
youll hit the rocks and kill
yourself

kids leap off the Waterfall and fall out of frame behind him

RACHEL
Well maybe put your feet up
against the cliff and likeshoot
yourself off

PETER

Peter awkwardly puts his legs up against the cliff face like

a frog As he does so the PHOTO MAN and PHOTO WOMAN jump
off and fall out of frame past him

remarkable

comic books and greek myth but to
see it up close was a real honor

William laughs as he drinks his wine in silence Peter takes
the hint and tries to temper his bragging

Well we’ve been sort of limited by
William’s leg but we did have a
REALLY romantic night last night

WILLIAM
We ordered room service and watched
