FADE IN
CLOSE SHOT - MANS FACE

It is a large sincere and kindly face of about fifty-five
years of age perfectly in keeping with the slow resonant
tones in which its owner speaks

MAN

(as we fade in)

with purity in our hearts with
right thinking in our minds we arm
ourselves with an intolerance of all
evil Thus it is on this glorious
Sabbath morning in this momentous
year 1887 that we naturally turn
our thoughts to that way of life as
exemplified by Victoria Our Beloved
Queen For this week begins Her
Majestys Golden Jubilee Her strength
and goodness her Christian
principles have walked in the light
of God ever since her ascension to
the throne From her heart has come
an ever-increasing flow of virtue
and moral blessing with which she
has endowed us her loving subjects

As the man speaks we BOOM BACK AND AROUND SLOWLY to discover
ourselves in All Souls Southwick Church London The man
speaking is the Bishop talking from the pulpit backed up
by the well-appointed magnificence of the Anglican altar WE
PAN AROUND the congregation in the pews For the most they
are the well-dressed and well-bred families of the period
listening attentively

CLOSE SHOT - IN BACK - MAN AND WOMAN

This is where the less well-to-do parishioners are seated A
rugged but strange-looking man of middle-age is seated here
with his wife She is watching him anxiously He is listening
intently to the sermon his head cocked forward Then he

looks away passes his hand over his brow and seems as though
to rise - as he looks at the Bishop os

WIFE
(detaining him with
a nervous agonized
whisper )
Sam - no Whats wrong Sam -

He looks at her subsides clenching his jaw

CLOSE SHOT - BISHOP
AS HE CONTINUES

BISHOP

(continuing)
She came upon a world sadly mired in
ways of the flesh and during her
reign the forces of good have achieved
notable and great victories over the
forces of evil And though we know
not the time nor the season we know
that Evil in Gods own time shall be
wiped out by God

At this point the Bishop is startled by the interruption of
a high-pitched scornful evil laugh coming from the back of
the church He looks up

CLOSE SHOT - IN BACK - MAN AND WOMAN
The man is laughing evilly at the Bishop His horrified little

wife is trying to quiet him and then looking about her at
the other startled people

WOMAN
(agonized)
Sam -- Sam --
MAN

(sneering out)
Evil wiped out eh So you want to
take all the fun out of life eh
Bishop

CLOSE SHOT - BISHOP
With hardly a flicker he continues

BISHOP
And may we not live for the day
when in the words of Holy writ the
Devil shall be cast into the
bottomless pit

GROUP SHOT - CONGREGATION

The laughter from os continues a little One or two half
turn about Several look at each other then back to the
Bishop with stiff-backed composure

BISHOPS VOICE
For surely the roots of the realm
and its peoples have sprung from a
new goodness during these last decades --

CLOSE SHOT - TOWARD ALTAR - GROUP

They are the backs of an elderly gentleman a young girl and
fine-looking man of about thirty with a Byronic head As the
laughter continues through the Bishops persistent intonation
the man turns full face into CAMERA AND looks back toward

the disturbance He is Dr Henry Jekyll his vital features
alive with interest

BISHOPS VOICE
(continuing)
At the family hearth in the shops
of industry in the very Christian
graciousness with which men and women
greet each other during the everyday --

OUT
CLOSE SHOT - MAN IN BACK

MAN
Bottomless Pit my eye Good old
Beelzebub - the boy with the horns
and the spiked tail - theyre always
running him down and hes the winner
in the end every time

A man in back of him tries to pull him down quietly He
shakes him off laughing In the bg the aislemen are hurrying
down to him

GROUP SHOT - CONGREGATION

Still they do not look about much paying even more attention
to the Bishop

BISHOPS VOICE

universal goodness is evidenced all

CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL
As he looks back studying man The young girl with him starts
to look back but the old gentleman on her other side nudges

BISHOP

-- as we live under the gentle hand
of Her Majesty and worship the glory
and wonder that is God It is because
of these things that - that -

(he gives a signal to

the choir-master)
- the world moves forward today

CLOSE SHOT - CHOIR MASTER 11

He signals over to the organist in the bg He motions to

the awed kids in the choir to stop looking toward the back

of the church The music starts the introduction to the choral
anthem

GROUP SHOT - IN BACK - AROUND MAN 12
The aislemen are struggling with him

MAN

(with a last shout)
You dont think evil is on a holiday
in here do you Ask this bunch here
when they met up with Old Nick last
Good Old Beelzebub -- Blasphemy I
call it to talk that way about a
mans best friend

But he is drowned out both by the sudden high soprano boys
choir and the booming of the organ as well as the fact that
the three aisle - men drag him out of the pew into the vestry
The poor wife follows But the other people hardly notice

him in their disciplined conservatism One aisleman dashes
on ahead

GROUP SHOT - VESTRY 13

A knot of aislemen are around the raving twisting man He

is laughing and muttering evilly The little wife is hovering
about wringing her hands as they lead the man from the

main part of the church

AD LIB
(in hushed tones)
Here here now man —- Never heard of

such a thing ssh Did Parker go

arm This is frightful

Just at this moment Jekyll comes hurrying out into the vestry

JEKYLL
(with calm authority)
One moment please

The aislemen step back

MAN
(to Jekyll who studies
him)
Let me back in there and Ill tell

WOMAN

The man edges her away from him In the meantime Jekyll has

taken a card out and is writing on it At this moment another
aisleman comes in with a very officious constable

CONSTABLE

Mrs Higgins is the woman with the man who caused the
disturbance in the church She is sobbing silently in contrast
to Beatrix and WE PULL BACK to see her standing outside a

door in the corridor of the hospital AS WE HOLD the door
opens and a young interne steps out with a rather
surreptitious look back into the room All we can see in the
room is the end of a bed with a mans feet strapped to it

MANS VOICE
(Higgins as door
opens )
Now Doctor my lad - as man to man -

The man laughs wildly The interne closes the door quietly
and WE PAN HIM as he hurries down the hall to the end and

INTERNES VOICE

The young interne comes out with Dr Heath a matured
physician of about fifty Dr Heath wears a worried frown on
his face WE TRUCK WITH THEM a little way back toward the
room

DR HEATH
(agitated - as they
come out)

He has no right to do such a thing

INTERNE
I suggested it would be better that

still --

DR HEATH

WE PAN them on down the hall to the door where Mrs Higgins
is waiting

CLOSE SHOT - AT PATIENTS DOOR 18

Dr Heath enters the room Mrs Higgins sobbing puts her
hand on the internes arm as he is about to follow Inside
the man Higgins is laughing evilly

MRS HIGGINS
Isnt there anything they can -

INTERNE
Everything possible is being done
Mrs Higgins Dr Jekyll knows more
about your husbands case than any
other mental specialist in London

HIGGINS VOICE
(from inside)
Why Heres another doctor But dont
ask him Hes too old

The interne closes the door The mans high laugh comes from
inside Almost immediately the door is opened by Dr Heath
who comes out with Jekyll

DR HEATH
Its a matter of ethics Jekyll I
cant allow it

MRS HIGGINS
Dr Jekyll cant I go in and --

JEKYLL
(gently patting her
shoulder )

Continues to Heath as WE PAN THEM DOWN the corridor Jekyll
obviously trying to control himself

JEKYLL
But good heavens man - this is the
chance of a lifetime for me The
more I see of the case the more I
realize it

The stop a little way down the hall opposite an open
unoccupied room

TWO SHOT - HEATH AND JEKYLL 19

HEATH
Its quite possible that this case
might fall within the bounds of your
research You know how weve all
admired your other work in the past
And personally Id like to bow to
your opinion here but in my position
as head of the staff I cannot
countenance --

He stops and realizes they are being watched os as he looks
down the hall

CLOSE SHOT - MRS HIGGINS - THEIR ANGLE 20
She stands looking at them pathetically wringing her hand
TWO SHOT - JEKYLL AND HEATH 21

HEATH

SLOW TRUCKING SHOT - MRS HIGGINS 22

She looks at the room her husband is in then starts
timorously along the hall to the door behind which are Heath
and Jekyll WE HOLD A SECOND here She would like to go in
She starts to knock Jekylls and Heaths voices are only
murmurs

JEKYLLS VOICE
(suddenly rising clear)
But Im not witch doctor

HEATHS VOICE
(rising too - very
clear)
Whos called you a witch doctor You
told me yourself youve had no
definite success I cant allow you
to experiment with -

There are sudden quick footsteps toward door and it is flung
open by Jekyll

HEATH
(following him)
Why the mans a human being -

Jekyll wheels on him at the door his eyes blazing

( )

22

JEKYLL

You mean he was a human being And
hed have another chance at it if
youd keep your hide-bound ethics
out of this There arent any rules
for discovering medical Utopia Or
perhaps you havent the courage to
face what might be the greatest -

He stops glaring impotently at Heath who steps back a
little so vehement is Jekylls look and attitude Then
with an inarticulate growl of disgust Jekyll wheels away
quickly AS WE TRUCK AND PAN with him to the end of the
corridor and around the corner The tension of his anger
relaxes into a bitter smile as he walks along He passes
some swinging glass opaque doors marked CHILDRENS WARD
and is about to go on when he thinks of something and turns
back entering the ward

PAN SHOT - JEKYLL - INT WARD 23

As he walks down between corridor of beds and steps quickly
behind screen which covers the fourth of fifth bed This is
obviously the Childrens Orthepedoic Ward as we see by the

condition of the patients in the various beds

CLOSE SHOT - AT BED 24

A small boy has obviously been badly smashed in an accident
A worried young father sitting by the bed gets up quickly
as Jekyll comes in The little boy his legs suspended in a
pully contraption smiles weakly at Jekyll as the latter
feels his pulse

JEKYLL
(to little boy)
Hullo Tommy Atkins - hows the war

The little boy laughs in weak happiness
FATHER
(to Jekyll)
Hes - hes going to be all right
isnt he doctor
Jekyll waits a second counting pulse

JEKYLL

(almost severely)

gesture and a rueful
smile)
Dont worry John The bull is leaving
the china shop

DR LANYON

But you must realize that Heath has
his --

( )

30 30

JEKYLL

(sardonically yet

with affection)
I realize Dr John Lanyon my friend
and eminently respected surgeon that
your Dr Heath is right My treatment
was not yet thoroughly proven And
if we doctors were allowed to
experiment on human beings too many
things would go wrong - and human
beings might lose faith even in the
proven good of medicine Isnt that
it

By this time WE HOLD as they reach a table near the foyer on
which doctors have placed their hats and sticks and from
which Jekyll picks up his

DR LANYON
(attempting to reason)
Harry --

JEKYLL
(now definitely)
But Im not far from proof And when
I get it Ethics or no ethics

Lanyon shrugs and laughs patting Jekyll with a soothing
gesture on the back and exiting os down another turn of
the corridor

Then Jekyll thinks of something and starts quickly back down
the corridor just as the interne of the previous SCENE rounds
a corner to meet him carrying a leather vial case WE HOLD

INTERNE
(handing case to him)
I thought perhaps youd --

JEKYLL
(quickly serious)
Yes

GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL BISHOP LADY COOPER 44

LADY COOPER
The soul How thrilling

BISHOP
(genially)
Come come - my dear doctor - now
youre invading my territory

JEKYLL
(looking at him with
a serious smile)
Yes my Lord - and I hope I may be
of some assistance

CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 45

He is a little startled by this radical statement and wishes
to assume that Harry is joking

SIR CHARLES
My dear Harry - of course you dont
mean this

GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL 46

He looks quickly over at Sir Charles picking up the
challenge

JEKYLL
But I do Sir Charles Just consider
that poor chap in church this morning
If you didnt see him you all heard
him Im sure

BISHOP
Ah yes I thank you for your
assistance there Dr Jekyll

DR COURTNEY
(with finality)
Hopelessly insane Obviously

MRS MARLEY
Why the simply shocking things he
said

JEKYLL
He wasnt insane There was just one
side of him in existence And that
side was speaking the truth

COLONEL WEYMOUTH
Good heavens Which side

JEKYLL
His evil side The man has been
spiritually distorted through shock
that explosion in the gas mains last
month Before that he was a fine
solid citizen - gentle and kind with
his children - deeply in love with
his wife Since then hes suffered
a complete change - so that this
afternoon I saw him entirely reverted
to the animal - slythinking and vile
dangerous and rapacious by turns

a little from Jekyll)

CLOSE SHOT - SIR CHARLES 47

The other maid is just taking away his dessert plate The
maid looks wide-eyed at Jekyll os Sir Charles is very
uncomfortable

SIR CHARLES
(shifting uneasily)
Yes ahumm

GROUP SHOT - AGAIN 48

DR LANYON
(trying to pass it
off casually)
But Harry - whats that to do with
the soul We can clearly understand
it as an injury to the nervous system
and therefore --

JEKYLL

(now lost in his

subject earnestly

reasoning)
No no John - I insist he has been
shocked from normal good into complete
evil When I said before he was a
good man I didnt mean that he
didnt have a bad thought or two
from time to time -- and perhaps
commit his portion of transgressions
against the laws of civilized society
Because after all - that is the
problem of civilized Mans soul -the
good and the evil in it are constantly
fighting one another

GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL AND BISHOP 49

The Bishop is the least affronted very interested but
adamnantly patient

BISHOP
There is a Higher Source from which
the good may always find aid in its
fight Dr Jekyll

JEKYLL
I realize that sir - but

50 CLOSE SHOT - COLONEL AND HIS WIFE 50

MRS WEYMOUTH

(haughtily - her hand

possessively on

Colonels arm)
Of course The Colonel and I always
feel that people can be good if they
wish to be - and well - otherwise
if they dont

COLONEL

(with a snort)
Exactly Discipline Everything
else is poppycock

(then militantly

changing subject

with a joke)
Haw But men going dotty and all
that do amusin things at times I
remember our sergeant during the
second Punjab campaign We attacked
and --

MRS WEYMOUTH
It was our quartermaster

COLONEL
(not breaking his
stride)
Quiet my dear - you were in Poona
at the time I remember this -

51 CLOSE SHOT - MARLEY 51

MARLEY
(his mouth agape as
he still looks at
Jekyll vacuous1ly)
But look here Jekyll - I mean I - I
simply must get this straight - you
mean —-

52 FLASH SHOT - MRS MARLEY 52

She is trying to get her stupid husbands eye to keep him
from pressing the subject

53 GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL 53

JEKYLL

(warmed to his subject

glad of the interest)
Well to put it as simply as I can -
Good and evil are so close as to be
chained together in the soul Man
isnt truly one but two Now what
if we could break that chain -
separate those two selves --

(his face alight

lost in his subject)
To free the good in man and let it
go on to its higher destiny to
segregate the bad in man - and let
it destroy itself in its own
degradation

(looks around sees

he has gone beyond

their comprehension -

finishes lamely)
Well roughly thats what my research

is leading to -- a combination of
chemical agents which if administered
would --

Marley has just awakened to the fact that his guests arent
very happy - particularly the two nervous ladies on his either
side Also he feels his own character attacked

MARLEY
(sputtering)
But see here - arent you rather
presumptuous in assuming there is
evil in all men

JEKYLL
Of course theres evil in all men

He speaks the following with a peculiar faunlike glee jabbing
at them with his tone quietly but watching them all as he
looks around the table Hes mad now at their subborn refusal
to look at the facts

54 PAN SHOT -— SLOW - AROUND TABLE 54

Jekylls voice comes over the stiff-lipped women and
uncomfortable men

( )

54

JEKYLLS VOICE
Wed be hypocrites if we didnt admit
it Weve all had thoughts we wouldnt
care to have published or shouted
out loud Our desires arent always
confirmed to a drawing room As
Christian we admit that Man was
created weak Its an honest problem
Shouldnt we face it

By this time WE HOLD ON the Bishop There is a tense silence

BISHOP
(with gentle dignity)
Suppose we believe that Mans soul
has not yet reached its fulfillment
Is it right or wise to tamper with
this problem until its Creator has

solved it - in His own mysterious
way
GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLL COLONEL BISHOP 55

The Colonel is looking across at Jekyll trembling with
austere indignation

JEKYLL
(softening a little)
My Lord - as I said before -

CLOSE SHOT - DR COURTNEY - 56
He draws himself up in a severe conservative huff

DR COURTNEY
Really Jekyll - this is quite
alarming Such theories are
dangerously close to a -- well I
hesitate to think what the Medical
Council will be forced to say if --

GROUP SHOT - INCLUDING JEKYLLS END OF TABLE 57
Sir Charles looks with alarm at what Dr Courtney is saying

JEKYLL

(with an undercurrent

of heat - but smiling)
Dr Courtney - advanced theories are
always the sore-point for the Medical
Council - or even a Queens physician
Especially if theres a confortable
profit in those already safely
established

( )

57 57

DR COURTNEY
(bristling)
Jekyll - if -

COLONEL
(suddenly exploding)
If you want my opinion young man -
this is all pure balderdash

JEKYLL

(right back at him)
Really Colonel Weymouth Suppose
we take your profession What about
the soldier when he comes out of
battle - keyed up from the lust of
killing What about his thoughts
Hes lonely - bewildered Why just
recall yourself as a young subaltern
in Egypt - back from a campaign up
the Nile - on a moonlit night in
Cairo What were your thoughts What
was in your mind

For a moment the Colonel is so moved by the glamor and
nostalgia in Jekylls words that his mouth is agape

COLONEL
(half remembering dim
conquests )
Well now - if you put it - I mean

thats something diff--

(then suddenly feels

his wifes eagle

glare - pounds table)

I was there about that time - with a

Onight at dinner I understand
what you said about good and evil in
people - and that its that way in
all of us but if good and evil
are so closely related in us -
chained as you said - why isnt -

(then she stops with

a little laugh and

a shake of her head

turning from him -

fingering flower

again)
Oh no - it sounds so silly - and
wrong even

JEKYLL
(tenderly)
This is you and I Remember us
Nothing you and I can ever discuss
will be wrong

BEATRIX

Well then why - why isnt the way
you and I feel about each other - I
mean

(hesitates then with

direct serious warmth)

Jekyll laughs tenderly and takes her hand in his

JEKYLL
Look here You and I are in love
Such a small word for such a great
thing

(MORE )

( )

72

JEKYLL (CONTD)

But whatever it is its a blessed
thing Bee It makes us one strong
living soul And it takes whatever
power - or even whatever secret
delight that there is in evil - and
turns it all into good

(searching her eyes)
Do I have to tell you that

BEATRIX
Oh no -

She surges into his arms They kiss passionately then look
at each other speechless for a moment

JEKYLL
(suddenly)
What in the world are we doing Here

Oh I know my darling - I dont
want to wait either Lets ask Father
if --

JEKYLL

SIR CHARLES
Im not one to brood about and all
that -- but you must have noticed my
attitude coming home this evening

JEKYLL
Why sir - I merely thought that -

SIR CHARLES
That amazing flight of fancy you put

forth at dinner I must confess it
startled me -- and even though Ima
broad-minded man myself -- it was a

little shocking too

JEKYLL
Well Im sorry Sir Charles - because
I assure you it wasnt a flight of
fancy at all

SIR CHARLES
You mean you actually were in earnest

JEKYLL
Profoundly so sir In fact Im
arranging to spend all my time at it --

SIR CHARLES
This is distressing Harry --

JEKYLL
(puzzled at his
attitude)
Why

SIR CHARLES
Its absolutely hair-brained in my
opinion

JEKYLL
(a little stung)
Im sorry you feel that way Ive
just been explaining it further to
Bee She understands

SIR CHARLES
(stiffening - but in
gentle reminder)
There are some things no gentlewoman
should understand

( ) 72

JEKYLL

Oh come now sir In this day and
age were surely getting beyond all
that sort of --

(breaking off)
Besides Bee and I are adults sir -

We want to be married as soon as
possible We both feel that --

SIR CHARLES
I thought we decided on February

JEKYLL
But thats months away We need
each other now I want her near me -
with me - in all the work Im going
to --

SIR CHARLES
No no Harry - I cant discuss any
change in the plans After this
evening more than -

JEKYLL
But Sir Charles --

SIR CHARLES
Harry Restraint is wise and healthy
in all matters A sort of proving
ground I waited five years for
Beatrixs mother

JEKYLL
(with a wry smile)
If youll forgive me sir -- you
were a very sturdy man

SIR CHARLES
(laughing)

Well Im not asking that of you -
but come now Harry Iwe always
wanted a son - and now youre going
to be that So listen to me my boy

of the evil in your soul over the

Whyyes Not quite a triumph

(with a serious little

smile)
But it was an attack

He looks at himself then thinks looks back at the garter
then over at a cabinet Then he makes his decision and
hurries to the cabinet pulling out some vials of powders

and liquids from various pigeon-holes As he hastily carries
them to the lab table and sits himself down to mix them we

DISSOLVE TO
CLOSE SHOT - FINISHED POTION 174

As Jekylls hand picks it up WE PAN to his face He hesitates
a second looks at the garter nearby then with a desperate
gesture he drains the potion The same reaction sets in as
before In violent convulsions his face starts to turn He
grips the sides of the chair in agony WE PAN DOWN to his
hand It turns into an animal-like appendage His four fingers
seem to grow together a little bit at the base and then
separate in the middle almost like the beginning of a cloven
hoof His neck becomes thick and shorter

WE PAN UP to his face It is worse than before WE PAN DOWN
to the other hand The same process is happening here He is
gasping and writhing all the while WE PAN UP again to his
face The transformation now becomes complete It is worse
in this second stage - more bestial than faun His writhing
stops He rises shakes his head - feels the change in his
thoughts

(NOTE The question of each metamorphosis and its subsequent
gradations according to makeup is open to debate so that all
parties concerned in the production agree and are satisfied)

GIRLS VOICE
(on track whispering)
Its in your eyes - its in your
eyes

He hurries over to the mirror to look He is truly this Mr
Hyde now whom he spoke about to Poole

HYDE
(into mirror gleefully)
Yes Mr Hyde Wonderful Mr Hyde
It is You are the modern Narcissus
Your face reflects mans Eternity as
it was meant to be

He leaps away from the mirror stretches himself like an
animal in the middle of the room thinks again

GIRLS VOICE
(whispering)
(with a low laugh) Caught arent
you Youre caught

HYDE
(suddenly exultantly)
No Im free Free

He capers about a second then quickly takes his cape stick
and hat from a hanger and darts out the back door

CLOSE SHOT - JEKYLL - EXT BACK OF LAB 175

He takes a key out of his pocket and locks the door Then
he turns and looks about him He takes off his hat and
stretches again in the rain looking up into the elements
Then he darts off into the darkness as we

We are SHOOTING TOWARD front door on which somebody is banging
furiously on the outside The slatternly landlady hurriedly
comes down the steps opens door She jumps back with a
startled cry as Hyde barges in

HYDE
(his eyes agleam)
Is she here Is she in

LANDLADY
(back up stairs a way)
Who Who do you want

HYDE
(pointing)
The dove - the little white dove
that nests in her warm loft up there

LANDLADY

HYDE

poking her with stick)
Clinging no doubt too

Come come - you leaf of jaded
lettuce Where is she Where does

LANDLADY
At the Palace of Varieties

HYDE

Ah At the Palace of Varieties
What a shallow hearth for the fire
of my lovely jewel

(then cocking his

head to one side)
But - variety eh Variety I like
that

With a caper he pokes the landlady in her backside with his
stick and dashes out of the door

CLOSE SHOT - CURB - EXT IVYS PLACE 177

Hyde comes out gleeful at the prospect of finding Ivy He
comes abreast of an old blind man who is timidly tapping his
stick on the curb preparatory to crossing the street Hyde
takes his arm with exaggerated solicitation

HYDE
Why why Let me give you a hand
Uncle

BLIND MAN

(with a happy smile)
Ohthank you sir

WE TRUCK AHEAD OF THEM across the street They weave their
way past a couple of drays Then in the middle of the street
Hyde kicks the old mans stick out from under him

HYDE

(laughing gleefully)
There you are Uncle - safe and sound

177

The old man exclaims inarticulately - Here - no - no - and
gropes about for his stick which Hyde flicks farther away
along the cobbles with his own A cart nearly runs the old
man down the driver pulling up with a jerk as the old man
reels backwards Hyde utters another happy laugh and WE PAN
HIM as he crosses the street and capers down the walk to
where a cab is standing near the intersection of a neuse

CLOSE SHOT - HYDE 178

As he climbs into hansom he taps the nodding driver with
his stick

It is the facade of the average cheap music hall of the

looks at the place with eager interest then turns to hand
the Cabbie his fare As the latter reaches down for the money
Hyde has the sudden caprice to pull him tumbling off his

seat rolling him on the pavement Hyde throws the money on
top of him and then pokes him with his stick

she looks back at the men below We cannot hear what she is

saying naturally

as she opens the bottle and sings at the same time Then she
turns as though to smile casually at the customer and gets
Hydes full look sees him for the first time and stops
singing staring at him Then she looks away starts singing
again only not very happily now and then pours only one
glass as she finally ceases singing entirely The song stops
and there are applause and shouts os

voice and touch Then she suddenly wrenches herself away

The fat little man comes hurrying into the fight elbowing
his way through

As he comes abreast of Hyde Hydes eyes gleam as he spies
the Managers Then with elaborate but quick prankishness
Hyde uses his stick like a billiard cue shooting it on the
rail letting the manager have it right in the side of the
eye then jumps up and down with laughter as the manager
goes down and we -

embrace her with the strange look of Hyde battling for
supremacy in his expression Then he contains himself and
lifts her up as he stands too

Once more - will you let me take
this glass and leave

revolver)
No This will be seen through to the

peace of mind - your reason even -
blasted by a sight that would shock

down into the frame and clutch her arms Beatrix in

and awful in physique and manner than we have ever seen him
in the transformation With a sudden yell he throws a huge

jar at the officers and ducks around the table (NOTE In
the following ensuing struggle ad lib commands from the
inspector should come at the proper time Grab him - hold
him - dont let him get up those stairs - guard that door

restored to himself for Eternity WE PULL BACK SLOWLY for a
tableau

DR LANYON
(line to come)

FADE OUT
