at the side of the road

MA races back across the street towards her open door carrying BUDDY She lifts
BUDDYs make-shift shield in front of the two of them and we see rocks and bricks
bouncing off the dustbin lid as she drives ahead into the storm of hurled stones like an
urban Boadicea

In foreground as a mass of bodies continues to pass up the street the massive iron grate is
slowly lifted The Rioters are nearly all masked with scarves across their faces
