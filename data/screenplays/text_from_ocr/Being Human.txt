and as he stared at the sky and listened to a cow
mooing almost dreamily in a distant village he tried to
understand what it all meant -- the sky and the fields
and the humming telegraph pole he felt that he was just
at the point of understanding it when his head started to
spin and the lucid languor of the moment became
intolerable

Vladimir Nabokov

In this script there are six main characters who inhabit
different periods of time from pre-history to the
present day But there is just one story Because we
blend into one developing narrative the lives that we
show

There is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation
or any other tricksy or mystic device We can do in real
time and with real characters what other movies strive to
do with immortal time travellers and ghosts Our story

is thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are
dealing with is real human magic
In moving from one character to the next everything will
change supporting characters setting period But the
ssential situation of our hero of the moment will relate
o the one before and the one following

he magic will be in the transitions in leaving one
haracter and advancing the film through hundreds or
housands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly
imilar human circumstances The effect of these transi-
ions across space and time will let the audience grasp
he simple truth behind our story that we are all in it
ogether

he key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human
connection at the heart of the film is that one actor

Haoettotayaoa
will play the six individuals The feeling will be of

the endless glorious playing and replaying of the simple
drama of being alive

We end the film with a present-day hero but by that time
we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh
light feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave
and the others who have gone before The resolution of
his contemporary story is theirs also By then perhaps
we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec-
tive too

And the structure of the film itself has the thrill of
novelty It has never before been used in cinema

Never Our six characters and their stories connect in
many different ways some obvious others vague tanta-
lizing threads Even global connections are made as the
planet itself and all its people come and go in the
story For the audience the game of making the connec-—
tions feeling the bonds even inventing or discovering
associations of their own will be endless in this big-
gest of stories smallest of stories It is truly a new
cinematic experience

BEING HUMAN
Hector is a family man He and his woman and two
children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a
hillside a shallow cave given protection at its entrance
by a covering of branches and brush Just inside a small
fire smoulders permanently a few times a day encouraged
into life for cooking or warmth If it ever went out it
would be a catastrophe so it remains a smouldering com-
fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family
Hector doesnt know that his name is Hector It is
simply a convenience to help us tell his story The idea
of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not
yet been made by mankind when we first meet him Hector
is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of
Christ in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet In
his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten
square miles of it

FADE IN

FIRST IMAGE

is the reflection of Hectors face in a rock pool The
image suddenly fragments Hector is enjoying himself

deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his

image reforms itself and then is disrupted again When
he is finished a trace of vanity makes him bend down
closer to his reflection He strokes his long hair and
fingers a blemish on his cheek

Then he is aware of another presence He sharply turns
Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some
rocks not afraid to show itself Hector calls out

HECTOR
Go back home leave me alone
We see that the figure is a young BOY Hectors son The

Boy thinks about it for a moment before turning and
disappearing behind the rocks

TITLE SCENES 1-4

The small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to
cook the days meal Beyond the fire on a rock shelf
HECTOR plays with his children a GIRL of six and Boy of
eight It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge
in but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal Hector
is acting the part of some trapped wild animal lashing
out at the hunters surrounding him But in his act of
wild rage he gets carried away He picks up his son and
throws him hard much too hard on his back

The Boy tumbles down from the shelf to the cave floor at
his mother DEIRDREs feet howling in pain Deidre
scowls at Hector If the gesture had been invented he
would probably shrug his shoulders The Boy howls on
Hector kneels beside his daughter absorbed in her antics
as she sleeps She is a vivid dreamer Her whole little
form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy
unspooling in her head She emits unearthly nighttime
noises squeals and giggles and moans Hector is fasci-
nated Where has his daughter gone Who is this strange
wild creature that has taken her form lying beside him
Hectors daughter delights him And while Hector watches
his daughter Deirdre from their bed watches Hector

It is almost dawn the cave is quiet and the fire has
diminished By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making
love on their bed of dried grass and skins Its diffi-
cult to say what their lovemaking might look like What
has 6000 years done to that art We will think about it
On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children
As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep
Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover
We CUT BETWEEN them the loving parents and the watching
learning children

Hector is arguing with his son just outside their cave
The Boy wants to go foraging with him again

HECTOR
No stay here stay
Hector takes a few steps The Boy follows
HECTOR
No go back go away

Hector walks on again taking big angry father strides
The Boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance Hector
walks on for some time before turning on him

HECTOR
Leave me alone Stay here
Stay

There is real anger in his voice The Boy wisely
retreats to the cave As Hector turns to continue his
walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from
the entrance She holds out her arms ready to comfort
the Boy rejected by his father Hector is in the
classic timeless no-win situation and he knows it
With a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach

EXT SHORE - DAY

Hector is foraging on the shoreline gathering cockles
seaweeds mussels crabs anything edible He splashes
in the shallows hoarding the food in a roughly-woven
bag Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its
shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed
Hector looks about 30 years old This is advanced middle
age for his times and it shows He has a heavy cold and
an irritating hack in his throat In a similar condition
a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly
drugged days in bed perhaps attempting a little light
paperwork propped up on some pillows

The sun is warming the day Hector sits on a rock sur-
veying his world He seems very much a part of it He
watches some wading seabirds nearby Like him they are
nosing around the margins of low tide for food He
smiles In another season they or their eggs will pro-
vide a meal or two There is a strange atmosphere of
appropriateness in the scene Hector seems such an inte-
gral part of it The easy fit of the man in his land-
scape strikes us Hector belongs to it in ways that a
present-day hunter or holiday maker or even naturalist
never could Also there is an odd sense of the world
being rather empty

Whether the larger world is round or flat spinning or
orbiting Hector neither knows nor cares He knows
simple things Cold and hunger He knows warmth rough
comfort and companionship His family and the safety of

their cave

Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh-
tens himself easing the ache in his back Then some-
thing disturbs him From behind a distant headland a
smudge of smoke trails into the sky Hector picks up his
bag and runs He knows where he is going He reaches a
vantage point on some rocks He steadies himself and
gazes hard out to sea We can feel the strain in his
eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the
glinting water Then his jaw drops in fear Around the
edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular
motion Their steady progress is full of menace Oar-
driven boats slowly insistently making their way into
Hectors bay He jumps from the rocks and runs up the
beach toward the cave One thing else that Hector knows
is fear blind gut-turning fear

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY

Hector is a small figure in the landscape now racing up
the steep slope in the direction of his home

He stops for breath and to look back on the bay The
shapes are distinct now two large open boats roughly
made but menacingly adequate for their purpose coastal
raiding The boats are nearing the beach now and figures
can be seen preparing to land Hector gathers enough of
his wits and strength to continue his race up the
hillside

INT HECTORS CAVE - DAY

Inside his family are in a state of panic They seem to
have prepared for this moment Through their agitation
there is purpose They gather bits and pieces to carry
with them in their flight Hectors children are attemp-
ting to take too much Hector shouts instructions to
them as he puts more wood on the fire It must stay
burning in their absence

Hector gathers his family together and they leave the
cave
EXT HILLSIDE - DAY

Hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope
further into the hills His woman runs off the other
way A hasty confused argument takes place

HECTOR

Up the hill

DEIRDRE

No down onto the other beach
The little ones cant take the
hill Neither can I

HECTOR
Up the hill Theyre down there
already I saw them

DEIRDRE
Youre wrong
She runs off down the slope Hector has no choice but to
follow her herding the children in front of him

Deirdre runs on heading for the lower slope and the cover
of some trees Then from these same trees she sees the
figures of the RAIDERS coming toward her She turns
running back up the hill Hector and the children also
turn and run back the way they have come by now dropping
precious bits of food and other possessions The Raiders
are running strongly five or six of them

The little Girl starts to go back for a precious toy she
has dropped Hector picks her up and carries her off
over his shoulder The Boy follows

Deirdre is trailing behind them She was right She
doesnt have the stamina for the hill Hector looks back
and sees the Raiders gaining on her His face is a con-
fusion of fear and indecision He almost stops as if to
go back and help her but then changes his mind and runs
off once again with the children Deirdre is by now
throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers
hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her
to gain some ground But they dont stop and the effort
tires her even more

She attempts one final dash and then all of her energy
gone she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers

the Raiders break their run also and trot and finally
walk the distance between them and Deirdre

Hector is watching all of this over his shoulder still
running He stops for a moment to watch Deirdre being
finally surrounded by the Raiders Then he runs on

EXT VALLEY - DAY 9
Hector is tiring too With the Girl still awkwardly
clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep
slope half-dragging the Boy up behind him He stops
for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the
valley below In a moment of utter panic he lets go of
his son drops the Girl from his shoulder and runs on
alone We can sense the moment of release in his
unburdened flight But it doesnt last long Some way
up the slope he stops and turns He sees his children
only now beginning to work out what has happened and
the raiders below He cant do it Even as the Girl
calls to him he is running back down the hill feeling
the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him

GIRL
Come back Dada

EXT VALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 10

Hector and the children have reached the safety of a
small valley higher up in the hills The raiders have
been slowed down by their capture of Deirdre Hector
is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of
a solitary tree on the hillside He coaxes them up into
the higher branches

10
BOY
Im hungry

HECTOR

Dont move from here Ill come

for you in the morning Theres

no food Try and sleep in the

branches Dont cry Dont make

a noise
Hector moves off looking back to his children in the
tree They too gaze anxiously at him They dont wave
Maybe waving hasnt been invented yet Hector heads off
alone higher into the hills

EXT ROCKS - DUSK 11
It is dusk now We find Hector waking from a fitful

sleep behind some rocks He sits up and takes in his
surroundings His face hardens as awareness of his pre-
dicament returns He stands up and then crouching low

moves off down the hill

EXT VALLEY - DUSK 12
Hector has returned to the area of the tree He slows
down some distance away and just in time He sees a
figure standing beneath the tree He moves forward to
the protection of some rocks and watches He is close
enough to hear the voice of the solitary Raider although
he doesnt understand the words The Raider looks up
into the branches and talks in a friendly persuasive
way
RAIDER

Its too cold to spend all night

up there Weve got a fire at the

beach Food too

There is no response from the tree The Raider coaxes
again
RAIDER
Come on Your mothers down
there Shes happy shes warm
too and full she wants to
see you she sent me

His friendly tone of voice has an effect There is
movement in the branches Hector can see the dark shapes
of his two children clambering down The Raider
stretches out his arms and helps the Boy to the ground

12
Then he reaches up for the Girl catches her as she drops
and keeps her in his arms He laughs in a comforting
way
RAIDER

That was easy eh Youre half

asleep already little girl Ill

carry you
Hector watches the Raider and his children move slowly
off down the hillside the Raider carrying the Girl in
one arm and holding the Boys hand They almost look
like a family

EXT BEACH - NIGHT 13

It is fully dark now On the beach the Raiders have set
up a comfortable camp with a large fire We are still
with Hector He has come down from his bleak hiding
place in the hills The smell of fire and food and con-
cern for his family have drawn him here He is hiding
somewhere way off from the camp but close enough to
observe it
What he sees disturbs him but for odd reasons His
family appear to be happily integrated with the Raiders
His two children have become fast friends with the man
who coaxed them from the tree His woman is with a
larger group closer to the fire They are playfully
attempting to communicate with her and although still a
little timid she is smiling There is no hint of bar-
barity rape or abuse That was not the intention of the
Raiders To them a fertile woman and two healthy
children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages
For their part the family have to accept the situation
Food and shelter are the best that life can offer

Painfully Hector takes in the reality of the scene His
family have been stolen from him plain and simple In
the morning they will be gone out to sea and round the
headland forever He watches them for a while longer
then it becomes too painful He retreats into the dark-
ness and up into the empty hills again

EXT ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT 14
Hector spends a long cold night alone squatting ina
narrow crevice in the rocks He doesnt sleep or even
attempt to close his eyes He stares into the darkness
There is nothing in the world to comfort him no phi-
losophy or religion no friend to run to This night he

is utterly alone

EXT ROCKS - MORNING 15
In the morning it is lightly raining Hector stands in

the drizzle outside the shelter It seems to revive him
refresh him even comfort him A sign however meager

that life goes on Then Hector trots off in the direc-

tion of the shore There is not much else that he can

do

EXT BEACH - DAY 16
The Raiders are loading up their boats wading back and

forth from the shoreline Hector watches from cover
His family are already on one of the boats awaiting
whatever lies ahead too afraid to betray real emotion

The last of the Raiders on shore wade out the short dis-
tance to the boats Hector watches these moments of
departure watches the faces of his family

Hector makes his move In a mad act he breaks cover and
runs down toward the departing boats The last Raiders
are climbing aboard Hector charges at full speed to the
waters edge He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and
impotently starts throwing stones at them The Raiders
all look at him The LEADER is impudently brushing
Hectors missiles aside like so many flies and smiling
Suddenly Hectors rage and energy leave him He stands
looking at the Raiders and they look at him for a long
moment The Raiders are all young men hardly into their
twenties and nowadays might resemble something like a
motorcycle gang But in Hectors time they are men in
the full prime of life They begin to laugh and exchange
remarks about Hector He returns their looks fiercely
His woman and children sit on the boat frozen in fear
The Leader eventually turns from Hector still smiling
and gives an order The men lift their oars and prepare
to leave Then an older man stands up in the other boat
He calls over to the Leader nodding in the direction of
Hector Hector doesnt know what they are saying but
they have an intense exchange obviously centered on him
The older man seems to be an adviser a priest or wise
man although hes still only about thirty years old
The Leader listens to him intently The PRIEST talks and
points to the cliffs The Leader looks there and nods
his head He gives some instructions to his men Hector
stands bemused Six or so of the Raiders leave the
boats wade ashore and without any resistance from him
take hold of Hector Hectors children instictively rise
as if to defend their father but Deirdre despite her
own feelings wisely holds them back

EXT CLIFFS - DAY
Hectors hands have been bound with rope He is being
led up to the top of the cliffs The Priest and the
Leader walk on ahead still talking intensely
At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the
wide sea are stretched out beneath them The Priest as
they arrive becomes excited He points to a pile of
large stones at the very summit of the headland The
mound of stones is obviously man-made
PRIEST
I told you I knew they did it

around here Ask him
The Leader moves closer to Hector and talks to him ina
friendly reasoning tone

LEADER
What do we do Do we throw you
over is that the idea
Hector doesnt understand He looks at him blankly
LEADER
He wants me to throw you over
What does it do Does it help the
sun Should I throw you over
The Leader tries to help Hector understand by miming the
act of throwing him off the cliff Hector doesnt know
how to respond
PRIEST
I tell you its one man one
stone Itll help the voyage
The Leader is unsure He walks around the pile of
stones checking it out from all sides as if it was some
infernal machine that he didnt know the workings of He
squats down and squints through it to the watery sun
emerging from the clouds far out to sea He looks across
to Hector now sitting on the grass The Leader sits
down beside him They sit together like friends The
ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim

LEADER

Whats it got to do with the sun
PRIEST

I dont know yet

The Leader looks at Hector Then he makes up his mind

17
LEADER

No Its too much of a risk

Just add a stone to the pile Let

him go Thats the best we can

do Lets go
With that he stands up The Priest with some sense of
ceremony looks around for a large stone picks one up
and places it on top of the pile He waits for a moment
almost as if he expects some consequence of his action

PRIEST
Its meaningless without him
going over the cliff

he Leader strides off back toward the beach The others
ollow him giving a final look or smile to Hector apart
rom the Priest who looks him up and down regretting
hat he is not by now a corpse in the ocean Hector
atches them go too shocked still to react in any mean-
ngful way He stands alone trying to unpick the rope
hat binds his hands
hen they are some distance from him Hector starts to
ollow them at first running to catch up and then simply
rotting after them The Raiders are aware of him behind
hem The Leader eventually stops and calls to Hector
LEADER

Off you go We dont want you
He turns from Hector and moves on Hector persists in
following them They are his only connection now with
anything that thinks or feels in the world His link
with them is all that is left Again and again the
Leader stops to shoo Hector away but Hector dumbly tags
along behind

tthe tee thay

EXT BEACH - DAY

The Raiders wade out to the waiting boats Hector
follows to the very waters edge then stands and bleakly
watches them The Raiders prepare to move off Hector
is an embarrassment to them now At the last moment the
Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men The man
clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again
carrying a large flint-bladed knife He comes out of the
water and walks up to Hector Hector is beyond any form
of reaction He will take whatever is offered to him
The man comes close the knife held ready He stands in
front of Hector for a moment On the boat Hectors
family are tense with fear for his life

( )

18
Then the tense moment passes as the man grunts and nods

at Hectors hands still bound with rope Hector under-
stands He lifts his hands and the man with some effort

hacks through the rough hemp Then he turns and wades

back to the boat

As the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him The
man stops drops back into the water and returns to
Hector on the shore He offers Hector the cut piece of
rope a weird gesture of conciliation He even smiles
Hector refuses the gift The man stands sheepishly for a
moment then drops the rope at Hectors feet and wades

back to the boat A piece of rope in exchange for a
family

Hector watches them for some time his family and the
strange Raiders as they achingly slowly retreat from
his view and his life

At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline He
goes some distance then stops thinks for a moment then
retraces his steps He goes back to the waters edge
picks up the piece of rope that bound him and walks

off with it It might be of some use to him

INT CAVE - DAY 19
Hector has returned to his cave home now cold and empty

of life He is working on his instincts now still
emotionally in shock He digs around in the embers of

the fire Some of the larger bits of wood still hold

some life Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly

and blow at the fires remains

We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire in the
simplest act of physical survival For him the problems

of emotional survival without his family lie ahead

INT BATHHOUSE FURNACE - DAY 20

This is another bigger fire In fact we might be in
hell A crude furnace blazes Filthy sweat-covered

men feed it with wood and charcoal an endless task given
the ferocity of the fire To one side of the oppressive
low-ceilinged furnace room some small boys endlessly
toil at two large bellows feeding the flames with jets
of air OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is
WHISTLING an odd human sound in an inhuman setting
Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood
We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass
of dangerously crude clay pipes oozing water and steam
at every joint

INT BATHHOUSE - DAY 21
Above the heat and filth there is a different world A
clean beautifully tiled world of lazing figures droning
conversations and resonant laughter It is the hot room
of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire We have
advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the
technology It is mens day at the bathhouse All of

the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and
comfortable with themselves Slaves wait in attendance
some around the edge of the pool others in the water
rubbing backs and massaging shoulders There are three

or four times as many slaves as bathers and the proprie-
torial way that they look after their masters gives the
place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over-
indulged grown-ups

And then we find our Hector He stands against the wall
holding a large towel Although clean-shaven and more
healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector more so

by the look in his eyes There is a set to his face

that tells us he is a man alone emotionally detached
from his surroundings He is a personal body slave He
watches his master in the pool alert to any hint of need
that he might have

Hectors master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others
around him He is in anxious conversation with an older
man wading beside him We dont hear what they are saying
but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius
pleading and the older mans cool distraction The older
man gives a final dismissive shake of his head Hector
immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as
Lucinnius climbs out of the water

LUCINNIUS

Im going to the cool room

INT BATHHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 22
Hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him

a look of concern on his face Lucinnius worries are
Hectors also

Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various
chambers of the bathhouse passing the games area and

the massage room as they go All around them slaves

attend to their pampered masters

INT BATHHOUSE - COOL ROOM - DAY 23

After an anxious scan of the cool room Lucinnius goes
towards three men occupying a marble bench
( )

Hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for
his master to sit on as he joins the others Hector then
moves out of earshot but still alert to his masters
behavior Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to
casually join his friends The eldest of the three

gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked
man in a towel can The other two are deferential to

the older man and treat Lucinnius with apparent con-

tempt Hector watches the older man put a paternal

hand on Lucciniuss shoulder and speak with a calm

smile on his face Hector almost winces to see his
master submit to this patronizing treatment Slave

and master exist so closely together that many of

their feelings are shared More precisely Lucinniuss
feelings are shared by Hector It is a one-way exchange
From morning until night and probably in his dreams too
Hector is living two lives his own and his masters
Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic

schizophrenia

As Luccinius stands to leave we can tell by their expres-
sions that the THREE MEN are open in their contempt for
him Hector is quickly on his feet and by Lucinniuss
side as he goes A final sarcastic remark comes from one

of the three
MAN 1
Well washed Lucinnius

Lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave

EXT STREET - DAY

This is not the grandeur of Rome but the dusty main
street of a provincial capital in Greece or Spain or
North Africa It is difficult to tell from the people
because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd faces from
every corner of the Mediterranean world It has some-
thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western
except that here the half-finished buildings are made of
brick and stone
Lucinnius leaves the bathhouse Hector follows three
paces behind him loaded down with the large towel the
scrubber robe and the wooden stool The stool goes
with them everywhere in case Lucinnius has to stop in
the street and converse with a friend Other notables
are among the street throng their own slaves tagging
along behind with their little wooden stools Some have
whole trains of slaves shadowing them Human status
symbols Lucinnius stops near some street stalls
Hector stops beside him

( )

LUCINNIUS
Bad omens Hector Bad omens
Get me something to eat Just
a mouse or two
HECTOR
Yes

Hector places the stool at Lucinniuss feet and moves off
Lucinnius sits down still absorbed in his problems

Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius as he orders the food

HECTOR
Two mice and some bread
STALLHOLDER
No mice
HECTOR
Two chicken legs then cold and
the bread

As Hector is given the food and pays for it he sees
another man JULIAN approach Lucinnius trailed by TWO
SLAVES One of them is carrying a folding chair much
more substantial than Lucinniuss Julian and Lucinnius
greet one another and sit down to talk Lucinnius at
something of a height disadvantage The Two Slaves move
off to one side Lucinniuss mood has brightened since
the arrival of his friend Their conversation seems open
and friendly

Hector gives his master his food and then moves to join
the Two Slaves hearing a snatch of the conversation as
he goes

JULIAN

Of course youre free to call at my

house at anytime but I was

receiving Nepos how could I

admit you
Hector offers to share his bread with the other Two
Slaves They easily fall into conversation inevitably
about their masters

SLAVE 1
Spoiled his day meeting your man
hes been avoiding him all week

SLAVE 2
His ships have gone too we heard
( )

24 24
This is news to Hector
HECTOR

When did you hear
SLAVE 2
Last night Nepos knew Pirates
Theyre sunk he reckons That
could finish him eh

HECTOR
This is the worst its been

SLAVE 1
Youll be up for sale before you

know it

This makes them laugh Hector less so than the other

two
HECTOR
Hes finished you reckon
The other two nod their heads
SLAVE 1
Yes at the baths I could
tell they smelled blood
HECTOR
Well if hed pulled it off hed
be in Rome by now
SLAVE 1
And you with him

Hector nods his head thoughtfully

HECTOR
And me with him half way home

Lucinnius and his friend stand and exchange their final
words unaware of the scrutiny they have been under or

so used to it that they are oblivious to it Hector

and the Slaves hurry to gather up the seats and take their

positions behind their masters The casualness of their
conversation has gone and they resume the formality of
their roles

25 EXT STREET - DAY 25

Lucinnius is eager to talk and tosses his words over his
shoulder to Hector

25 25
LUCINNIUS
Hes a true friend probably the
only one I have left

Hector obligingly trots a step or two closer to Lucinnius
to aid their conversation

HECTOR

Will he lend you the money
LUCINNIUS

He was honest about it He said

so plain and simple No
HECTOR

Thats a problem

Lucinnius unburdens himself

LUCINNIUS
And the ships have gone did I
tell you that

HECTOR
Have they

LUCINNIUS
Cyprian knows already Hell
want his money back too

We can see the concentration on Hectors face as he
concocts appropriate responses

He has a tough occupation being the alter ego to an
ambitious loser in one of the most competitive and
dangerous societies ever to exist And he has to carry
the stool and the towel as well

LUCINNIUS
When we get home I want you to get
some chickens and fetch Hermas
the diviner
HECTOR

Yes

INT HOUSE - DAY
At home we find Lucinnius and Hector with the diviner
HERMAS They are gathered around a shrine in the large

public room

The entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of

marble Hermas prods them with a knife He makes much
of the mysteries of his craft as if it were a skill
beyond ordinary men

The other two peer over his shoulders Suitably mysti-
fied Lucinnius talks in a reverent low voice

LUCINNIUS
Are my ships from Sicily still

afloat

Hermas tetchily stops him
HERMAS
No no offer the grain first
sprinkle it on the altar
Lucinnius obeys

HERMAS
and we cant ask the Gods

specific questions like that

its a gentle probing enquiry

general questions but lets

see
He cuts into the chicken liver and prods around the in-
side The other two wait in silence

HERMAS
General answer no

LUCINNIUS
What do you mean

HERMAS
I mean no The liver says no
Lucinnius objects

LUCINNIUS
Do it again I want you to do it
again Is it the Gods will
that Cyprian be well disposed
towards me in the future

HERMAS

If you want to do it again you

need another chicken and another

fifteen sesterces and Id like

the first fifteen now please
Hector looks a Lucinnius who nods reluctantly Hector
opens his purse and counts out the coins for Hermas

INT HOUSE - NIGHT
Hector is giving Lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage

Lucinnius is still in a talking mood His troubles
wont allow him to relax
LUCINNIUS
Cyprian loaned me half a million
to fit out these ships Im

finished Just when things were
going well I had plans for you

too Hector in four or five
years I was going to make you a
free man and then in ten years

youd be a citizen you you

couldve found your family
brought them here everything

Hector smiles ruefully
HECTOR
It sounds good
Lucinnius misses the irony in Hectors voice and enthuses
about his own future generosity
LUCINNIUS
It does doesnt it
Lucinnius is silent for a while as Hector continues to

rub his shoulders
LUCINNIUS
I shouldnt give up I cant
Ill visit Cyprian first thing

tomorrow before the others can
get to him hes got to see
reason I can pay him back

sometime Its the only chance
we have Hector Should I do it

HECTOR
You must
LUCINNIUS
Youre right I must
This burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius His tense

muscles yield more to Hectors fingers
THALIA enters the room She is a household slave a
Nubian from Africa She carries a lighted torch and
moves around the room lighting the wall lamps Lucinnius
watches her

27
LUCINNIUS
Thalia I think I need one of
your massages Hector you can

finish the lamps
Hector does as he is told He takes the torch from
Thalia and discreetly leaves the room hearing Lucinnius
as he closes the door
LUCINNIUS

Lower Thalia
INT HECTORS ROOM - NIGHT 28

Late at night Hector is still awake He rises from his
bed and quietly moves out of the room He is careful
not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him
some of them sprawled on the floor He shares his bed-
room with at least eight other slaves Privacy is a
masters privilege

INT HOUSE - NIGHT 29
In the darkened house Hector makes his way up some

stairs and along a passage The only sound is a crack

or two of far-away THUNDER At the end of the passage

Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall

He climbs this and lifts open the trap door above his

head

EXT ROOF - NIGHT 30
Odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only

source of light as Hector moves across the flat roof

In one corner he sees what he is looking for the outline

of a figure resting against the low parapet wall He

moves towards it The figure speaks

FIGURE
I missed you last night
It is Thalia We can tell that they are close Hector
sits down beside her
HECTOR

He kept me working until morning

THALIA
Whats happening

30
HECTOR
He has no money and a lot of
enemies If hes very clever hell
survive but the omens are bad
and hes not very clever

THALIA
She doesnt like him
HECTOR

Nobody does Hes unfortunate
You get people like that Clumsy
and sad

Thalia looks out towards the sea

THALIA
Why does the thunder always stay
out on the ocean
Hector puts an arm around Thalia At first it feels

strange their physical intimacy alongside their matter-
of-fact conversation but gradually we understand it the
giving and taking of comfort where it can be found and
the realness of their friendship Their stroking and
touching and holding becomes good to watch We get a
feeling for what they have given one another in stolen
hours and half hours up here on the roof the only place
where they can be themselves
HECTOR

Its the Gods arguing Theyre

working out what to do with

Lucinnius hell be lying awake

down there wondering what

theyre saying about him

They laugh Far away some street DOGS BARK
HECTOR
If he goes down Ill ask for my
freedom he owes it to me he
said as much you too we
could be free

THALIA
Then what

HECTOR
What we talk about

By now he is kissing her THALIA
We talk about going home Yours
is that way and mine is that
way your family is that way
HECTOR
I just made that up I dont
know which way they are anyway
you cant think like that

Not after so many years

THALIA
Its what you talk about
HECTOR

We talk about it because it can
never happen What we do is you

and me

THALIA
I dont understand I think youll
leave Youre going to leave me

here
HECTOR
Never Its you and me now
Thats all
THALIA
Well We stay here Hell survive

Hector is silent still kissing her He yawns as he

speaks
HECTOR
Then I can see you every night
Im tired

31 INT HECTORS ROOM - NIGHT

Hector is back in his bed A figure enters the room
steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes
him awake Hector comes to Lucinnius stands over him
whispering

LUCINNIUS
I cant sleep Get me a chicken
I want to make another sacrifice
Well do it ourselves

Hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows
Lucinnius out of the room

INT HENHOUSE - NIGHT

Hector is in the henhouse in the dark selecting a
chicken for sacrifice He is about to leave when he

sees a MAN and WOMAN arms around each other sitting in
a corner The Man looks at the white hen Hector is
holding

MAN
Cant you find a woman Hector
Hector smiles He isnt surprised to see them They are
only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof The Slaves
have their meeting places scattered all over the house

HECTOR
Sorry to trouble you just
fetching a chicken good night

the roofs free
The Man shakes his head with a smile Hector leaves the
sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms
HECTOR
Come on miss you can tell
Lucinnius his future

EXT STREET - MORNING

Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian
Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master
and he carries a large satchel of documents Cyprians
home is a street palace It is early in the morning but
there is already activity around the house visitors
coming and going messengers petitioners A few impor-
tant callers arrive in litters carried by slaves
Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door
and are checked in by the gateman Lucinniuss hopes of
quietly bending Cyprians ear are dashed It seems as

if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial

Mr Big

EXT COURTYARD - MORNING

The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard gossiping
and playing games of chance on the ground Their masters
wait on the other side of the courtyard seated on
benches along the wall Cyprians aides usher the
visitors into his presence in a regular flow some have
an audience of a few minutes others last merely seconds

Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius like a mother watching
her child from a distance on its first day at school
( )

34
Lucinnius sitting expectantly in line does look a
little pathetic even ridiculous Straight-backed hands
on knees alert worried he looks a bit like a sacri-
ficial offering himself

Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves
as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by
place to the front of the line We almost expect Hector
to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is
finally summoned into the inner office Hector waits

The first signs seem good Lucinnius doesnt emerge
within the first minute Cyprian is at least giving him
the time of day More minutes pass Hector watches a
game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door
One or two others familiar to us from the bathhouse go
into the office So does Lucinnius friend Julian

Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight a broad
smile on his face Hector relaxes and leaves the ball
game to join him
HECTOR
You look happier

LUCINNIUS
Relieved anyway relieved that
its over at last
Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector
following after him

EXT STREETS - DAY 35

Lucinnius and Hector are walking home in their usual
formation Hector is closer than normal so that they
can talk

HECTOR
Will he help you

LUCINNIUS
I have to kill myself by tomorrow
morning He has all my letters to
Titinius none of them got
through He says its like
treason and he says I should
want to die for owing him half a
million anyway

Hector is shocked

HECTOR
What if you dont

35
LUCINNIUS
Then he will and that wouldnt
be pleasant he would drag me to
Rome those letters
Lucinnius shivers to think of them
LUCINNIUS
Im done for Hector but its
strange I feel kind of good
about it the struggle is over
weve seen it through
together eh
HECTOR
I dont know what to say
LUCINNIUS
Lets get home We have a lot to
do
Lucinnius quickens his pace
LUCINNIUS
Tonight peace at last
Lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock
INT HOUSE - DAY 36
Hector and Lucinnius are in his study Lucinnius is
busy clearing up his papers He is less hysterical than
in the previous scene more aware of the reality of what
he has to do

LUCINNIUS
Well do it with a knife Hector
When everyone has gone to bed
The two of us to the end

HECTOR
I dont understand What do you
want me to do I dont think I
can help you

LUCINNIUS
Well help each other Hector We
must Weve been through this
whole mess together we must die
together

HECTOR
I dont know what you mean What
mess
LUCINNIUS

You dont understand do you Im
asking you to die with me
youre my closest my dearest
slave what would they say about
me if you refused to die with me
This is honor were choosing

death were not going to submit
to the humiliations that Cyprian
can heap on us are we

HECTOR
You say we I dont know what
is we Ive done nothing I

know nothing

Lucinnius changes his tone becomes more in his own
mind frank man-to-man

LUCINNIUS
Hector at Cyprians this morning
I had to sign certain papers
tell a bit of a story

HECTOR
What kind of story

LUCINNIUS
A confession That we were
plotting against Cyprian and the
provincial senate we were short
of names most of the people I
know were in the room people I
thought were my friends so I
mentioned you I had to

Hector is stunned with shock

HECTOR
So Im a conspirator

LUCINNIUS
Yes So you see I dont want you
to die with me just because of my
honor its more complicated
Im sorry Hector I would be
honored if you would die with
me I mean it

Hector manages to speak

36 HECTOR
Can I sit down

LUCINNIUS
Of course

HECTOR
This is the worst its been

37 EXT COURTYARD - DAY

Hector is in the inner courtyard of the house beside the

kitchen He is talking to GALLUS who is Lucinniuss
ten-year-old son Hector has a close friendship with

him As we listen to their conversation it becomes clear
that Hector finds comfort in the boy for the family that
he lost

Today there is an air of distraction about Hector
Understandable considering his scheduled death
The kitchen slaves come and go as they talk

HECTOR
But even if its round you can
still fall off the edge
Hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make
his point
GALLUS
No its not round like that
its round like this
Gallus sees his playball He picks it up

HECTOR
Do you believe everything that
Greek tells you

Gallus ignores this tease intent on the ball

GALLUS
Rome must be right in the middle
here and we must be out here

somewhere
Hector becomes more interested

37

HECTOR
So where is my home

GALLUS
How many months did they march you
here

HECTOR
Seven

Gallus walks out the distance from Rome with his fingers
as if there is serious calculation
GALLUS
It must be about here

His fingers stop on the other side of the ball

GALLUS
But then youd be upside down
HECTOR
I wasnt upside down and how
could you see the sun round there
I saw the sun at home every

day
Gallus is stumped for answers

GALLUS
Ill ask him tomorrow
Hector remembers that he and the boys father are
supposed to die that night He looks on Gallus with a
new tenderness

HECTOR
Yes tell me tomorrow Id like
to know because my children are

round there and I want to know
that theyre getting the sun
ask him something else too
where are the gods if the whole
thing is round

GALLUS
I think I know that theyre out
here and all around thats how
they can look down and see
everything
INT ALTAR - NIGHT 38

Lucinnius is at it again In the lamplight a live

chicken stands on the altar
( )

38
Hector and Lucinnius watch it as if their lives depended

on it Perhaps they do

LUCINNIUS
If he eats the grain it means yes

He scatters some grain on the table The chicken at once
begins to peck them up
HECTOR
Its saying yes theres a way
LUCINNIUS

No its saying yes we should die

HECTOR
But you asked it if we had to die
or if there was another way its
saying yes there is

LUCINNIUS

No its saying yes we should die

The bird is certainly enjoying his food
HECTOR

Maybe its just hungry
The chicken is inscrutable as they are prone to be
INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 39
A dead chicken adorns Lucinniuss table He and his
wife DALMIA and their son are lying on their couches
picking at the food with their fingers Lucinnius is
drinking more wine than usual Hector and the other
household slaves are in attendance Thalia is also
there serving her mistress
Dalmia knows something is up but she doesnt know what
She attempts to break the silence She calls on the cook
from the kitchen

DALMIA
Solus

The kitchen slave quickly appears
DALMIA
Solus Im eating chicken again
I ate chicken yesterday and the
day before will I be eating
chicken again tomorrow Why am I
always eating chicken

39
SOLUS looks up at Lucinnius and Hector but they offer
him no help

SOLUS

Its what we have to hand in the

kitchen maam I always try to

use the fresh stuff the

chickens have just been turning

up
He looks again at Lucinnius and Hector They look at
each other Thalia looks at Hector Dalmia looks at
them all looking at each other more intrigued than she
was before

A SLAVE interrupts them

SLAVE
Two men have come to see you
From Cyprian
Lucinnius and Hector look at each other and share a
moment of hope They might be coming with good news
perhaps a softening of Cyprians heart

INT RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT 40
The two VISITORS that await Lucinnius and Hector are an
unpromising sight They are big men unsophisticated and

look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas A couple of

the godfathers foot soldiers

They greet Lucinnius deferentially but he knows that

they would break his back at the whim of their master

VISITOR

Good evening Lucinnius Cyprian

asked us if we could be of any

assistance in the business that
you have to conduct tonight to
make that business as

comfortable as you could wish
Lucinnius sighs as his last hope expires

LUCINNIUS
Thank you gentlemen But I feel
that I will be capable of taking
care of my affairs tonight without
your help Thank Cyprian for his
kind thought

The heavies metaphorically keep their foot in the door
( )

40
VISITOR
Were spending the night at the
house of Nepos not far from here
Dont hesitate to send your man for
uS at any time Were anxious
that things should go well for you

LUCINNIUS
Thank you Good night
VISITOR
Well call in the morning at any
rate just to make sure
LUCINNIUS

Thank you

Hector is closing the door when one of the Visitors talks
roughly to him
VISITOR
You Come here
Hector instinctively looks to his master Lucinnius
doesnt protest but retreats into the house Hector is
left alone with the Visitors
VISITOR
He looks like the kind thatll
want some help Have you ever
killed before
HECTOR
Only chickens
VISITOR
Hes not much different Use a
thin blade but long Get it in
deep the heart feel fora
space between the ribs

He prods at Hectors body freely showing him what to do
If it is ticklish Hector doesnt let on
VISITOR
or go in from the back any
place hell let you
We leave Hector nodding obediently as this weirdest of
coaching lessons continues

VISITOR
Getting it outs not as easy as
you might think you have to

twist a bit to get over the
stickiness

INT STUDY - NIGHT
Late at night in Lucinniuss study an oil lamp and a
candle cast their shadowy light adding to the tension in
the room Hector stands beside Lucinnius who is
counting out coins and other valuables on his table
LUCINNIUS
Eight hundred sesterces cash
thats all thats left what
a failure my father left me

three farms and forty thousand

Lucinnius places the money in a box on his table He is
quite drunk resigned now to his fate Hector however is
cold sober grim-faced Lucinnius looks up at him

LUCINNIUS
Nothing else to be done Dont
you want some wine
HECTOR
No but I want something
LUCINNIUS
What is it
HECTOR
I want to die a free man I

dont want to die a slave
Lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile He

clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony
into his voice

LUCINNIUS

Hector by this proclamation I
make you a freed man I dont
know the exact words Ive never
done it before But youre free
Hector

HECTOR
In writing so that when they
find me they know I died a free
man please

Lucinnius looks at him for a moment then reaches out for
his paper and pen
LUCINNIUS
Very well

He scratches out a few words on the paper Hector looking
over his shoulder keenly watching what he writes
Lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen

LUCINNIUS
Theyll find it in the morning
Its a nice thought Hector you
were right to ask

HECTOR

Thank you

LUCINNIUS
Well freed man lets do it

Lucinnius picks up a large kitchen knife which lies on
the table He fingers its blade

A trickle of fear passes across Hectors face Will the
half-drunk Lucinnius want to kill him first

HECTOR
What do you want me to do

LUCINNIUS
Nothing I mean not to me I
have to do it first you
understand that and then you
if I dont succeed then you
must help me

HECTOR

I understand

LUCINNIUS
No point in messing up the room
Lets go downstairs

Lucinnius stands and leaves the room Hector follows
with the oil lamp

INT PASSAGE - NIGHT

The house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the

passage and down the stairs to the washing room Hector
walks behind casting the light on Lucinniuss crumpled

defeated form Lucinnius begins to sob at first
quietly then more loudly and more pathetically Hector
looks around and behind him afraid or perhaps hoping
that Lucinniuss moans will wake the household

INT WASH ROOM - NIGHT
Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of

distress with drink and terror and self pity
( )

He runs into the tiled washing room wails loudly and
makes a stabbing motion at his stomach Hector sees all
of this from behind as he enters the room Lucinnius
crumples to the floor and squats on his knees He calls
out in pain

LUCINNIUS
Oh that hurts that stings
Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool
holding his stomach Hector sits down beside him They
both look down at the blade still in Lucinnius body
LUCINNIUS
This is hopeless

They sit absurdly like this for a long moment neither
of them knowing what do do next Its awkward like ina
waiting room Then Lucinnius speaks

LUCINNIUS
Help me Hector
HECTOR
Youve done it youve done it

lie down
Hector speaks gently like coaxing a frightened animal
He helps Lucinnius lie out on the marble floor
HECTOR
Close your eyes you did it
LUCINNIUS
Thank you thank you
The movement has increased the spread of blood over
Lucinnius clothing He raises his head
LUCINNIUS
You do it now Hector hurry

HECTOR
Lie still lie still

LUCINNIUS
Do it Hector do it you
promised
It looks as if Hector is playing for time

HECTOR
Shush Ill need the knife
( ) 43
LUCINNIUS
Take it do it

Lucinnius voice is fading now Hector waits then
reaches down for the knife in Lucinnius stomach We

see on his face the effort as he pulls at it and do we
detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius
on his way Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little Its
as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released
from the wound His voice is even more faint

LUCINNIUS
Do it Hector do it do it
Hector has the knife in his hand but still he waits
looking at Lucinnius willing the last dregs of life from
him

LUCINNIUS
Do it do it do it

The whispers fade to a croak Lucinnius lies still

Hector has won this final battle of wills He stands up
suddenly repulsed by what has happened But quickly he
gathers his wits He makes his decision He throws the
nife down It clatters along the hard shiny floor

Hector has run out of the room before it has come to rest
against the wall
INT STUDY - NIGHT 44

Hector runs into the study and makes for the box contain-

ing the coins He puts most of them into a leather money

bag and ties it to his waist Then he pulls on

Lucinniuss cloak and rushes out of the room He returns
quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the

table Then just as he is leaving he again stops sits

down on the chair pulls off his worn shoes and places on

his feet a pair of Lucinniuss stout street sandals

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT 45

Hector is walking quickly from the kitchen across the
courtyard to the street gate Near the gate he stops
and looks back at the house He makes a decision and

retraces his steps across the courtyard and back into
the house
INT THALIAS ROOM - NIGHT 46

Thalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor
with two other women Hector gently shakes her shoulder
trying not to wake the others After a moment or two
Thalia opens her eyes

( )

46
Hector whispers to her before she has time to open her
mouth
HECTOR

Im leaving come now if you

want to but we must hurry

Im a free man Im free

Will you come
EXT HARBOR - NIGHT 47

The shadowy cloaked figures making their way down to the

harbor are Hector and Thalia

Nearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading
and preparing ships for the morning tide By the light
of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard voices shout
WINCHES CREAK Hector encounters a night WATCHMAN but
diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him

HECTOR
I have some mail for Tyre where
are the east-bound ships
WATCHMAN

Ask at the harbor

With an authoritative nod Hector strides off in the
direction of the noise and lights Thalia at his heels
Hector talks when the Watchman is out of earshot

HECTOR
We want a timber ship they go
west straight to Rome
THALIA

And then Then you go home

Hector hurries on noncommittal in his reply

HECTOR
You can go to anywhere from Rome

EXT QUAY - NIGHT
Hector and Thalia approach a ship heavily laden with
timber Final supplies are being carried aboard super-

vised by two

He indicates
Thalia climb

men on the quay Hector approaches them

HECTOR
Where is the Captain

CREWMAN

Hes on the ship

aman standing on the rear deck Hector and
up the gangplank and approach him

HECTOR
Good morning Captain Im
looking for passage to Rome for
both of us

CAPTAIN
And who might you be

HECTOR
Im the steward of Lucinnius the
merchant we have business in
Rome I need an immediate
passage

CAPTAIN
Its five or six days to
Brundisium you can walk or ride
from there you have money

HECTOR
Of course

CAPTAIN
Well lets see passage for
two food for two six days
what were you thinking of offering

HECTOR
When do you leave

CAPTAIN

Anxious to leave are you
HECTOR

Keen to start yes

INT SHIP - DAY 49
Hector and Thalia are asleep huddled together in a cor-
ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters

A CREWMAN comes and shakes Hector awake He stirs himself
to the sounds of a SHIP UNDERWAY the sounds of the SEA-
WASH the WIND in the CANVAS the MOANS of the TIMBERS

CREWMAN
Captain says to come on deck
Hector wakes Thalia and they clamber out of the darkness
of the hold onto the brightest freshest of days at sea

EXT SHIP - DAY 50
There is no sign of land behind them The ship is moving
swiftly in a strong clean breeze and a light sea We

can tell from Thalias reactions that she has never been

out at sea before at least never above deck Every-

thing is novel to her and it shows even the movement of

the ship Her excitement is childlike

THALIA
Wheres the land gone

Hector too is taken by the novelty of it all but is
less prepared to admit it He waves his hands around the
empty horizon noncommittally
THALIA
Have you been on a ship before

HECTOR
Yes of course
We can tell he is lying

THALIA
Me too but they kept us down
there
She points down into the lower depths of the hold Then

she gets even more excited

THALIA
Tonight well be where the
thunder is
They look at each other and then all around them The
freshness of the day and on an overwhelming feeling of
freedom exhilarate them Their senses and their
feelings are in new territory They are like children

in a brand-new world
The Captain on the other side of the ship beckons them

CAPTAIN
Thought you would like to see
them

He points to three shapes in the mid-distance ships
heading for the port they have left There is a thrill

in their glamor their fine progress under full sail

CAPTAIN
Your masters ships going
home

HECTOR
No they cant be theyre
lost
CAPTAIN
No theyre not I know these
ships my brother-in-laws the

master of the big one with the

brown sail
Hector and Thalia look at each other The Captain smiles
at them and looks back to the ships coursing healthily
on their way

CAPTAIN

Somebody been putting the wind up

Lucinnius Thats an old one

didnt think anybodyd fall for

that

EXT SHIP - DAY

Later the ship is still making brisk progress Thalia
and Hector are sitting on deck some distance from one
another They are quieter now more thoughtful Hector
catches her eye Hector is drawn by her smile and moves
to join her They sit quietly absorbed in thought

thoughts of each other their looks and smiles tell us
that As if they are talking without words Hector

looks around him A sailor on the forward deck is
sorting out some rope an echo of a previous time and

place The wind catches the sailors hat He grabs it
from the air and spends time arranging it once more on
his head just so A tiny human moment

EXT WAGON - DAY

A man is driving a heavy two-horse wagon The wind has
just lifted his hat from his head He spends some time
replacing it carefully just so Watching him from the
back of the wagon is Hector

The drama of the lives of Thalia and Hector has played
itself out long ago Between the breath of sea breeze
that lifted the hat of the Roman sailor and the gust of
mountain wind that snatches the hat of the wagoner lies
1400 years

Hector sits in the wagon beside a woman There are

tantalizing similarities between their situation and the

one we left Thalia and Hector in on the boat a few
moments ago 1400 years ago

The woman and Hector exchange glances now and then
delicate signals of mutual awareness Talking without
words
They are not alone in the wagon perched on its half load
of timber With them is a NUN accompanying a GIRL of
about eight The Girl is tearful A man his face
unseen is snoring underneath his hat A younger man
gaunt and hungry-looking is dressed in the rough
travelling clothes of a monk or PRIEST Even without his
habit we would know he was a holy man His incessant
talk tells us
PRIEST

We want to praise God because we

live in this ultimate age when

all things are done all is known

all the wonders of his creation

revealed to us nothing more for

man to see or do all that is
left is the hope of salvation

even for our humbler sisters
The Girl is sobbing through all of this

PRIEST

Yes weep child weep for joy

you are a glorious example to us

all already a child of Gods

blessed to spend your earthly days

within his church as Christs

servant what generous parents
you have giving you to the
sisters What a sacrifice

There is an Irish lilt to his voice which colors what

he is saying with a tinge of mischief He is a difficult
fellow to pin down Hector looks at him amusedly still

sharing his thoughts silently with the woman BEATRICE
The Nun interrupts the Priest cheerfully

NUN
Shes already received the last
rites before she left her family
She belongs to God now Dont you

The child sobs more noisily

PRIEST
Fortunate child destined for
paradise Untouched by the

abiding curse of carnal lust I
struggle against it
(MORE) 52

PRIEST (CONTD)
I will not join myself carnally
with any woman
He looks accusingly at Beatrice

PRIEST
I will carry my unspilt seed
from this world to the next as

should every man

Now Hector is getting the hard looks from the Priest
PRIEST

If all men forsook forever the
fleshy temptations and held
womankind to barrenness think
how much the sooner would come the
day of judgement all Gods
chosen gathered in paradise Ive
written a small treatise in favor
of virginity sister We could
discuss it later if you like

The DRIVER of the wagon turns his head briefly to the
Priest
DRIVER

What are you talking about
Hector gestures to Beatrice that he is leaving the wagon
to walk for a while and asks her to join him She shakes
her head with a smile Hector smiles too then jumps
down from the wagon and walking slowly allows it to
gain ground in front of him The ramblings of the Priest
fade away

PRIEST
Its simple brother if we
cease carnal union entirely then
in fifty or so years well all be
rid of our earthly lives and God
can proceed with His reign over
His heavenly kingdom that same
paradise that God gave to man
before but which man was so unfit
to inhabit that within seven hours
Eve was already tempting her
master and mate and within nine
hours the Lord had to expel the
both of them Just think they
messed it up in nine hours

EXT MOUNTAIN TRACK - DAY

Hector smiles as the Priests VOICE FADES into the dis-

tance It is a cold fresh day of early summer They are

back along the rim of the road Then

he sees where the noise is coming from A mounted

F

skirmish is in progress just where a wooden bridge
crosses the small river at the very bottom of the valley
There are no more than 30 knights in full armor with
twice as many foot soldiers and squires Even from such

a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is
ferocious almost insane in its intensity From this
distance it is like a puppet show except the violence

is real The scene places Hector in his time and for us
there is a strange feeling to it almost as if Hector

has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to
some distant age But this is not the case Hector is
where he belongs in Medieval Europe

Hector makes his decision With a last look behind him
he runs off in the direction of the wagon Like any wise
citizen of a violent age Hector knows when to leg it

EXT WAGON - DAY 54
Hector catches up with the moving wagon and jumps onto

it happily back in the security of his fellow

travellers He smiles at Beatrice

HECTOR
A bit cold walking
She smiles at him He sits opposite her in the wagon
and allows his foot to touch hers She doesnt move
away Hector calls to the Driver
HECTOR
How long to get there

DRIVER
When it gets dark well be there

Hector looks at Beatrice
( )

54
HECTOR
I thought I heard fighting back
there
Beatrice replies but in a language that Hector doesnt
understand

BEATRICE
I dont know what youre saying
I havent understood anything
youve said all day

Hector talks back to her

HECTOR
I dont know what youre saying

They both smile It doesnt seem to disturb them too
much that they dont share a language They repeat

their incomprehensible statements just for the fun of
it
BEATRICE
I dont know what youre saying
HECTOR
I dont understand
Beside Hector the Girl has stopped sobbing but she is
still troubled She turns to him and speaks quietly but
with determination
GIRL
I want to go home to my mother
Hector doesnt know how to respond He can do nothing

to help her and anyway is more interested in Beatrice

EXT FARMYARD - NIGHT 55

It is almost dark when the wagon finally turns into the
yard of the farm where they will spend the night

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 56

The Farmer and his Wife have laid out a table with
simple food a stew bread and wine The travellers settle
down to eat The Priest however makes a performance out
of his more modest needs He calls loudly to the wife
working at the open fire

( )

56
PRIEST
Just bread and water for me
Mistress I have no need of wine
or meat
She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving
thanks to God for his simple meal muttering his grace
quietly to himself excluding all others from his conver-
sation with the Almighty

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 57
In the dark sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an
upstairs room Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a

blanket of soft sound over the human forms

One of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow Hector
in another corner of the room sleeping lightly becomes
aware of this He watches as the figure stands up and
picks its way between the bodies to the door The figure
pauses and crouches over Beatrice Hector can hear the
distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her from head to
toe and then a deep long sigh The figure stands up and
moves quietly to the door disappearing downstairs
Hector rouses himself and follows the other

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen The

figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING
there Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the
Priest He already has a chicken leg between his teeth
as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under
his arm He emerges from the pantry He sees Hector
standing by the table They recognize one another and
relax The Priest doesnt re-enter his holy act He
speaks normally cheekily

PRIEST
God Im starving Do you think
I dare heat that up on the fire

He indicates the large pot containing the remains of the
stew
PRIEST
No Ill eat it cold I
deserve to suffer

He pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the
table to Hector

Then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks
of meat as they talk

PRIEST
Have some wine

Hector takes a drink

HECTOR

I saw some fighting today back
up the road

PRIEST
So the mad knights are at it
again what were they Swiss
or English

HECTOR

I dont know They all look the
same to me

PRIEST

It might help us get through
if theres a bit of confusion
well still travel separately
though for now
The Priest changes his tone of voice mocking his own

holy act
PRIEST

But Hector you must keep out
of the way of temptation I saw
the way you were eyeing up that
widow now stay away from
that although she is beautiful
is she not but were going

home remember
Hector is smiling

HECTOR

How do you know shes a widow
PRIEST

Look at her eyes hungry eyes

she could lead you into trouble
she smells like paradise though

He changes his tone yet again He talks straight

58 PRIEST
Listen Hector lets get this
clear if anyones going to dally
with that widow itll be me you
couldnt handle her shed
bewitch you at any rate youre

not a sinning kind of fellow are
you why dont you get off up
the road tomorrow and Ill catch
you up in five or so days

Hector doesnt answer but smiles The Priest has
stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely
PRIEST
Youre not a sinning fellow
remember another month and
well be at the channel then
home the little ones you only
talk about when youre drunk
dont forget them
Hector still remains silent The Priest is worried

PRIEST
Why do I always talk so much
you werent even thinking of her
til I opened my mouth but I
trust you dont worry I know
you wouldnt do anything to anger
your God or me Get me some
bread
Hector obeys the Priest without thought The Priest is

happier now that he is in control again
PRIEST
Who saved your neck in Venice
HECTOR
You did Ronald

Hector approaches the Priest with the bread
PRIEST
And dont you forget it

He raises his cup to Hector
PRIEST
May the Lord forgive us our sins
those we have committed and those
we as yet only dream of Shes
a glory of a woman For all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of
vulnerabililty in Ronald For all his bluster there is
the feeling that he needs Hector as much as he claims
Hector needs him

EXT FARMYARD - DAY

Overnight the remnants of a company of soldiers fresh

from battle have collected in the courtyard Some are
tired dispirited others are wounded Our Travellers

watch from the farm window A few mounted knights come
into the yard herding in front of them a small group of
prisoners well-dressed knights and squires

INT FARMHOUSE - DAY
The travellers look out on the exciting scene and talk
as they eat their breakfast of bread and milk
PEDLAR
Hostages too theyve got they
only take the rich ones
He turns to the forlorn Girl
PEDLAR
Have you ever seen so many fine
rich men my girl
Hector talks to the company but means his words for the
Priest

HECTOR
I wont be travelling today

The Priest looks him straight in the eye
PRIEST
The fightings behind us brother
youll be safe enough
Hector shakes his head catching Beatrices eye

HECTOR
Ill stay
PRIEST
You should go

The Nun puts an arm around the Girl
( )

NUN
Were going God will protect
his ewe lambs

Suddenly the door is thrown open and four SOLDIERS man-
handle an inert body dressed in full armor into the

room They scatter the food from the table and lay out
the MOANING suit of armor on it A young SQUIRE follows

them in and kneels by the knight in the suit The MOANS
are MUFFLED because the knights helmet has been battered
out of shape in the battle and cant be removed The

ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the
head inside The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the
helmet Their efforts are useless Blood oozes from the
joints of the helmet The MOANING suit of armor seems
inhuman robot-like

SOLDIER
Must be sore in there Is it your
dada
The Squire looks at him and nods his head Hector looks

with sympathy at the boy

SOLDIER 2

If hes got a little head it might
be alright Has your dada got a
big head

An OFFICER comes into the room
OFFICER
Is there a blacksmith here
Wheres the smith
FARM WOMAN
In the village sir half a day
away
The Officer looks at the moaning suit of armor then at
the astonished group of Travellers He picks on the

Priest
OFFICER
You Priest come here get to
work on him hes not ready for
heaven yet theres a hundred
thousand livres on his head if I
get him to Paris alive Start

praying theres fifteen livres

in it for you if he lives

The Priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to
pray earnestly The Officer turns to the Soldiers

60 60

OFFICER
Get that helmet off get

hammers anything you can find

and one of you get back down into
the valley and fetch an armorer

The Soldiers scatter to carry out their orders Hector
takes time to watch the Squire still kneeling beside his

father quietly stroking the helmet Ronald the Priest
mutters every prayer he can remember The suit of armor
twitches and MOANS

Hector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow
him outside The Priest looks on helplessly as they
slide past the table and head for the door

EXT FARM - DAY

More soldiers have continued to make their way to the
shelter of the farm Everywhere is the chaos of war
Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the
medicos or the priest Prisoners huddle in cowed groups
Everyone looks for food Individual soldiers like lost
souls run here and there trying to regroup with their
comrades The youngest are squires of twelve or thir-
teen the oldest are red-faced overweight knights in
expensive armor

Hector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they
can sit and talk Behind them is a group of soldiers
reserves who have not yet joined the battle They are
much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci-
plined unit

Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground
drill and battle training To the BEAT of DRUMS they
perform rhythmic hypnotic movements repeating the same
pattern over and over again A deadly dance thrusting
their pikes in unison They become like one evil
inhuman machine It is mesmerizing to watch all the

more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector
and Beatrice are acting out They have the problem of not
sharing a language but resourceful as lovers are they
soon employ this as another titillating element in their
love-play

HECTOR
I think you know what Im saying
a little

BEATRICE
No I dont I dont understand
a word

HECTOR
How come you dont speak like
anyone else Are you far from
home Home Where you sleep
and live

BEATRICE
I think I know what you mean
home

HECTOR
Im far from home too way way

over there then across the sea
BEATRICE

Youre losing me again
HECTOR

Have you ever seen the sea Water

everywhere right to the end of
the world I come from the other
side of the little water then
theres the big big water I
had a friend who sailed on that
went too far fell right over
the edge into nothing They

never came back they fell off
the world

Hector smiles pleased with himself Beatrice laughs

HECTOR
You think thats funny Its
true its a sad story you
shouldnt laugh

BEATRICE
Talk about home again remember

you said home

HECTOR
Im not making sense am I Well
lets go back to homes Thats
where Im going Ive been away
for too long Some people locked
me up I had to run away

BEATRICE
Tell me something else

nome

We have to learn to talk the
same try it like me
home
BEATRICE
I know what youre saying
youre saying home say

HECTOR
Home home try it
BEATRICE
You want the word for home
home say it home
HECTOR

I dont want your word for

I want you to say mine
home

BEATRICE
Come on you can do it
home

Beatrice has her way turning the table
says it in her language

HECTOR

Home home

Beatrice smiles
their relationship is set

BEATRICE

Thats it clever boy

They fall silent

moment by reaching out to Hectors neck
like a caress Hector smiles There fir

home
home

nome

s on Hector He

In this tiny victory the dynamic of

suddenly shy Beatrice breaks this

very delicately
st touch Then

it changes Beatrice completes her movement with a sharp

grab at Hectors hair and pinches her
Triumphantly she shows him the flea she

BEATRICE

Tick its a tick

fingers on something
has caught

HECTOR
Flea a flea thanks

Beatrice looks at him directly now their intimacy well
under way

( ) BEATRICE
Bet theres more in there You
need a good going over nobodys

been looking after you
She ruffles his hair in a motherly but then again sex-

ually provocative way He understands her well now

HECTOR
Why dont we go somewhere and
have a good session I could do
you Id like to give you a
good grooming
They understand each other perfectly now They look
around for a more private spot

INT FARM - DAY

Ronald the Priest still kneels by the inert knight in
armor The boy Squire still sits by his fathers head
Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer The knight
is deathly still no sight or sound of breathing or
moaning The suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid
as we look at it There is no sense of it containing
life The Officer re-enters the room from outside

OFFICER
How is he
PRIEST
Sleeping now at peace for the
moment
OFFICER

Leave him for a while There are

a few souls out here you can help
on their way to heaven Ten sous

a soul to you come on

The Officer leaves Ronald quickly follows him outside

RONALD
Twenty sous is normal How many

are there

When they have gone the Squire gives his father a nudge

but there is no response from the knight just the
impression of lifeless bulk

EXT FARM - DAY 63
Hector and Beatrice have found some privacy near the

trees and by a low wall Some bushes hide them from

full view of the farm yard Hector is sitting cross-

legged and Beatrice kneels behind him giving his head

a thorough going over Mutual grooming is the original

and perhaps the best form of foreplay Hector certainly

likes it

BEATRICE
Thats four

HECTOR
Yes it does feel good
She gives his scalp a final delicious rub and then stops

BEATRICE
You can do me now
Beatrice loosens her clothing to bare her neck and
shoulders Hector begins to probe her hair and scalp

She arches her back under the first touch of his fingers
Hector laps it up inspired to caress ever more tenderly

her scalp and neck still with the outward purpose of
looking for fleas

HECTOR
Got one a tiny little one
yours are so small and fair

To Hector even her fleas are a delight He seems to want
to keep it as a pet There is no hope for this man
Beatrice moans softly happily Hector still kneading

her scalp
HECTOR

I dont know your name Im
Hector who are you Im
Hector
Beatrice replies with a hint of breathlessness

BEATRICE
Hector yes Im Beatrice
HECTOR
Beatrice
BEATRICE
Yes Hector I think youll
have to do under my arms Im
a little itchy there
( )

63
HECTOR
Yes I think Beatrice is a good
name
Beatrice is sighing contentedly now
BEATRICE
Maybe we should find the river
and have a proper wash
In between parting the hairs on her scalp Hector is kiss-
ing her on the neck now At first it is small snatched
kisses amongst the grooming but soon the kisses become
longer and the grooming less
BEATRICE
Im still itchy lots of places
Hector
EXT FARMYARD - DAY 64

The Priest is with some seriously wounded soldiers laid
out in a corner of the farmyard Whether he is a bogus
priest or not Ronald is taking his duties seriously
There is a little of the rogue about him now He sees
the Nun and the little Girl preparing to leave They
have acquired a mule They mount up the Girl behind

the Nun and plod off through the farmyard They stop
briefly beside the Priest to say their farewells

PRIEST
Goodbye little girl the Lord
will bless you I know in his

house
He talks to the Nun as they move off

PRIEST
How long for you on the road

NUN
Three or four days

PRIEST
Good luck to you

NUN
Theyre not killing nuns yet

PRIEST
The Saxon wont he go with you
( )

NUN
Hes nowhere to be seen

The Priest watches them go and then returns to his
duties with the wounded

EXT TRACK - DAY

The Nuns mule turns out of the farmyard and heads off
along the track A few Soldiers are burying some of
their dead nearby The Nun watches this and doesnt see
what the Girl sees on the other side the mingled bodies
of Hector and Beatrice all pretence at grooming now
gone engaged in fervent lovemaking Its probably the
first and last that the Girl will see A smile flickers
across her face before she turns away forever Ahead of
her there might be many a bleak night in her convent
when she will remember the image and that same smile
will return to her lips

EXT FARMYARD - DAY

The Priest is kneeling beside a young wounded Soldier
He is close to death but in his youth is fighting it
He is frightened and clings to the presence of Ronald
SOLDIER
My name is Peter dont forget
tell everybody that was my
name Peter
Ronald is mumbling his prayers
PRIEST
Lie still Peter

SOLDIER
Thats it Peter tell everybody
write it dont forget it
Peter tell them Peter died here
my name is Peter Peter
say it again

Ronald stays with the boy as he struggles against his
own annihilation
PRIEST
Peter

Ronald behaves well with the dying boy

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 67
The Priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness He

yawns a long contented yawn He has completed the

hardest days work that he has undertaken as a priest

if he really is a priest If he is not then the pre-

tence has been just as exhausting He wants to sleep

INT FARMHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT 68
In the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the
darkness Some officers have moved in and the place is

more crowded than before The Priest makes his way to

his corner but on the way he pauses by Beatrice She

snores lightly The Priest bends over and takes a long

sniff at her then he sighs out his admiration

He steps over her and settles into his own space by the
window He suddenly misses the presence of Hector He
looks again at Beatrice still and sleeping What the
Priest doesnt see is the extra pair of hands massaging
her neck and head She moans softly in her pretence of
sleep

The Priest is troubled suspicious but he doesnt know
why He sniffs again in the general direction of
Beatrice The mingled smells that his sensitive nose
detects perplex him but he settles down pulling his
cloak over his head

Across the room Hectors head emerges from the covering
beside Beatrice They make love quietly in the dark
also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest

INT FARMHOUSE - DAY 69
The Priest wakes up Outside he can hear the first
sounds of the day the murmuring VOICES of Soldiers in

the yard the CLATTER OF MILK PAILS In the room it is
still semi-dark The Priest sits up The others have
already left but Beatrice is there stretching herself
and fixing her hair Hector is not with her She smiles
at the Priest Then in another part of the room Hector
emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing sits up
and smiles too

HECTOR
Good morning
Hector and Beatrice look at each other The Priest looks
at them in turn Their cheeky act of innocence mocks
him

EXT FARMYARD - DAY 70
Hector is washing himself by the stream that flows close

by the yard He drinks a handful of water for breakfast

The Priest sees him from the farmyard and comes to join

him

Hector is in a cheerful mood pleased with himself and
his success with Beatrice The Priest is sullen
reproachful
HECTOR
Youre a busy man what with all
these souls departing
PRIEST
Theres nothing wrong with helping
someone to die in peace They
want me to go with them
HECTOR
Nothing at all
PRIEST
Are you staying here

HECTOR
Moving on as you told me to
well meet up like you said
Ill wait for you at the channel

PRIEST
Shell do you harm I told you
She might be a witch Wait for
me I still have the money from
Venice We can be home in a
month

HECTOR

Witch my arse Stop giving me
orders

Both of them are unhappy now confusing one another
spoiling their friendship
HECTOR
Youre a strange fellow Are you
a priest Are you jealous

The Priest is silent They are saved from hurting each
other more A Soldier shouts down to them from the farm

SOLDIER
Were moving soon Father
( )

The Priest turns to Hector for what might be the last
time

PRIEST
So youre leaving

HECTOR
You have work to do here
The Priest walks back up to the farm Hector calls out

what might be an attempt at an apology or simply another

taunt
HECTOR
I dont understand you

The Priest looks back at him briefly then walks on

EXT TRACK - DAY

Hector and Beatrice have packed their few belongings into
a shoulder bag They turn out of the farmyard and walk
down the main track

Hector catches a last glimpse of the Priest being helped
onto the back of a horse behind a Soldier He is ridden
off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop
Other battles lie ahead to be blessed and more battered
bodies requiring comfort

Hector and Beatrice are enjoying the first pulse-
quickening flush of their intimacy and the thrill of
nowing it will go further They chatter freely

despite not sharing a language
HECTOR
Im glad were going the same way
BEATRICE

Well have to sleep in the hills

tonight Will you keep me warm
The damp greyness of the early morning has lifted and the
sun is shining as they step out onto the higher hills

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY 72
Hector and Beatrice have stopped to eat They shelter in
the fold of a hillside with a wide stream running some
way below Hector feeds Beatrice a piece of cheese from
his knife
( )

72
BEATRICE
Hurry up and finish your wine and
then we can make love
Hector seems to know what she is saying He throws down
his knife and cheese lying down with her on the grass
He kisses her breasts and her body eagerly He lifts her
skirts and caresses and kisses her naked legs and thighs
She stretches herself out happily arms spread wide on
the grass Hector talks through his kisses

HECTOR
Why do you smell so wonderful
He lifts his head to let her see him sniffing

BEATRICE
Oh you like my smell do you I
make it from the flowers I put

it here and there and there
Hector kisses her more She smiles and turns her head to
the sky Then she starts to giggle

BEATRICE
I dont believe it someones
watching us the dirty devil
dont look hes down by the
water by the rocks
Hector doesnt understand and keeps on with his kissing
Only her persistent giggling makes him stop and look up

Hector sees him too Down by the stream a head peering
over the top of a rock not even attempting to hide

BEATRICE

Cheeky devil

HECTOR
Hes not moving He mustve seen
us though

She sits up and straightens her clothing suddenly
anxious

BEATRICE
Dont look at him anymore Lets
go down the other side of the

hill

But Hector still looks at the figure in the distance
There is an uneasy silence while Hector works it out
Then he speaks HECTOR
Its a dead man

Beatrice doesnt understand Hector stands up still
looking at the figure

HECTOR
Come on were going that way at
any rate
They move cautiously When they are closer to it and

can see it for what is is they walk straight for the
dead body

EXT HILLSIDE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

It is the body of a young squire handsomely dressed
in the livery of his master Such a squire would follow
his knight into battle guiding him through the chaos

But this boy seems to have died a less public more
furtive death He lies leaning against a rock eyes
open an expression something like a smile on his face
There is no sign of a wound
Hector looks around at the ground
HECTOR
No sign of a battle only a few

horses or just one He wasnt
killed in a fight
BEATRICE
Poor boy Isnt he fine-looking
Look at his shoes
There is a sadness about this young death in such a
lonely place Hector and Beatrice are open to this sad-

ness but in their age sentiment was of a tougher strain
BEATRICE
Well cover his eyes at least
so the crows dont get him Look
at these shoes though

She is already gathering stones Hector sees what
Beatrice is doing
HECTOR
Thats good of you

As he lays him down Hector sees a small dry wound on
the boys side Beatrice brings her armful of stones and
starts to build a mound around the squires head

73
Hector helps her by gathering stones from the stream
Soon they have covered his head completely with stones
his body lying exposed
HECTOR
Its all we can do It wont keep
the wolves away though

Beatrice is still taken by the boys shoes
BEATRICE
His feet are like mine you know
Ill give you mine poor boy and
Ill have yours I have more
walking to do

She looks at Hector
BEATRICE
Its not stealing if I give him
mine is it
Hector watches as Beatrice exchanges her old shoes for
the squires They fit her well and she proudly shows
them off to Hector He smiles at her

EXT STREAM - DAY 74

Later Hector and Beatrice are enjoying each other
immensely making love by the stream Beatrice hasnt
removed her new shoes she likes them so much She is
dabbing Hector with her perfume which he has discovered
she keeps in a small bottle kept in a pouch on a chain
around her neck

Nearby the corpse of the squire still lies its head
shrouded in stones as if absurdly hiding its eyes from
the antics of Hector and Beatrice The old shoes
Beatrice has placed on its feet look odd compared to
the fine uniform

Hector and Beatrice seem unaware of the strangeness of
their situation but perhaps it only looks strange to
our modern eyes

Hector continues to bask in her wonderful aroma
HECTOR
Youve put magic in this stuff
havent you youre bewitching
me
They appear to get the gist of one anothers love talk

74
BEATRICE
Youre eager today Hector arent
you Is it all this death
HECTOR
I dont know what youre saying
but I like you when you talk

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY 75

Hector is watching Beatrice conduct some kind of
ceremony over the corpse of the squire She takes a
handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her
bag Mumbling strangely and quickly to herself she
walks around the corpse three times scattering the
leaves over the body

Hector is fascinated but a little uneasy He watches
from a safe distance During the few moments that it
takes Beatrice seems like a different person

Then all of a sudden the familiar friendly Beatrice
returns She completes her ceremony by throwing a few

drops of her perfume over the body She smiles

BEATRICE
That should help him a little

HECTOR
We should go now Weve been here
too long

BEATRICE

I wonder if his mama will ever
know what happened

HECTOR
You said mama I know what that
is mama We can talk the
same

BEATRICE
Mama thats right mama

EXT HILLSIDE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY
They have reached the summit of the hills It is like
the roof of the world Below them lies the valley The
air is clean The landscape looks untouched by man
but a few smudges of smoke in the distance suggest farms
or villages There might be the glimpse of a castle on
a hill

76

If it all feels oddly familiar to us then perhaps it

is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story book or
an ancient landscape on a gallery wall Once again in
the film there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not
from a dream but in a dream

The moment passes in the more down to earth concerns of
Hector and Beatrice

HECTOR
I have to keep the sun on my back
thats what Ronald said the

sun on my back all the way home
Ill stay on this side of the
river

BEATRICE
Yes of course we stay on this

side of the river
down

all the way

until tomorrow

HECTOR
I stay on this side

BEATRICE

side And how many people have done that through the

ages in caves or by campfires or in suburban bedrooms
There are many ways in which we will be able to connect
with this perplexed flea-ridden man far away from home
huddling by a fire in the forest trapped in his time as
we all are

EXT FOREST - MORNING

Hector and Beatrice are on the move again They make
their way down into the thickening forest Beatrice
walks ahead light-footed and humming to herself She
seems to be in comfortably familiar territory now The
mist swirls about him as Hector follows on behind
tagging along as if caught in her sexual wake

EXT BOAT - DAY

Hector and Beatrice have reached the river broad and
slow-moving Beatrice has hailed a boatman from the far
side He maneuvers his small boat to them and they
clamber aboard Beatrice and the boatman greet each
other familiarly They gossip amiably as the ferry makes
its way across the river Hector sits quietly with a
smile on his face their chatter incomprehensible to him

EXT SHORE - DAY
As they climb out of the ferry Hector is suddenly unsure
of what he is doing

HECTOR
I think were going the wrong way
I want the sun on my back We
should have stayed on the other
side

He mimes what he means
( )

BEATRICE
Dont worry were nearly there
Ill fix your back for you give
you a good rub

Before he can protest she has moved off So he follows

her

EXT VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

They have reached the outskirts of a village Beatrice

turns off the main track and up a narrow path Hector
follows her Soon she stops at a small house close to
an orchard The house sits in the mess of a run-down
farm yard chickens and goats running here and there

Beatrice opens the door of the house and goes inside
Hector hesitates before following her

INT COTTAGE - DAY

Beatrice turns to him when they are inside

BEATRICE
Here we are home you want
some food and then Ill show

you everything We have a spring
you can wash
Hector stands looking around the small dark room
Beatrice suddenly seems shy and awkward

BEATRICE
This is when I wish you could
understand me Youll have to

learn you know I want you to
stay here You want to dont
you

Hector looks at her in silence
BEATRICE
I look after the hens and I make

dyes from the plants and perfumes
too Im good at that But Im

no good with the sheep and the
goats I wish you could
understand Arnauds been dead
two years

She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window
( )

83
She lifts the lid and removes some mens clothing rough
working trousers and a hide jacket

BEATRICE
I still have his clothes Ill
make them fit you
She holds the jacket up against Hector to measure it
Hectors reaction to a dead mans clothing is

predictable

HECTOR
What did he die of

BEATRICE

Im getting shy Imagine me being

shy with you I made this for

him tonight well try them on

Youre the same height as Arnaud

but a little thinner Ill make

them fit Im a good sewer And

we have a big bed upstairs for

you and me in the rafters You

and me sleep
Hector is beginning to understand what she means but he
keeps his feelings to himself Beatrice talks on Now
that she has started she wants to say it all

BEATRICE
I like you You like me too
dont you We were lucky to meet
the way we did All the men around
here are old

Beatrice falls silent overtaken by her shyness Hector
understands fully what she means now but his mind is
a confusion He cant respond She tries to direct his
thoughts to the one area she is sure about

BEATRICE

Come up and Ill show you the bed
She climbs a ladder nearby and lifts open a trapdoor
on the wooden ceiling Hector climbs up to join her and
together they stand on the ladder with their heads poking
into the tiny space above

INT COTTAGE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

Beatrice is proud of her bed a rough mattress on the
floor covered in some blankets she has probably made
herself

The bed takes up most of the space of the small attic
They look at it together

BEATRICE
A good bed eh For you and me
We can have fun up here better

than a ditch

She laughs Hectors expression lightens a little too
It occurs to him to take up her offer immediately She

catches his thought and the moment tingles happily

Then from outside they hear voices Firstly a young Boy
calling
Boy (0S)
Mama are you home

INT COTTAGE - DAY

Beatrice and Hector descend back in the room A BOY
of about eight and a GIRL of ten are coming in from the

garden They have been working outside Beatrice goes
to embrace each of them Hectors face is a confusion
once again

GIRL
You were gone a long time Whos
this
The Girl eyes Hector up and down
BEATRICE
This is Hector
Beatrice pronounces his name with care She stands
proudly by her children
BEATRICE

These are my children

The CREAK of a door makes Hector turn his head
BEATRICE
and this is my mother

An OLD WOMAN stands in the main doorway smiling at
Hector and nodding her head She speaks to her daughter
MOTHER (OLD WOMAN)
So you found one eh

Hector stands surrounded by instant family and doesnt

know what to do Eventually he speaks

HECTOR
Is there water to drink to
wash
He mimes with his hands Beatrice understands that he
wants some breathing space She talks to her son

BEATRICE
Take Hector to the well but
come here first

She takes off the dead Squires shoes and puts them on
the Boys bare feet He is delighted He does a little
dance in them before leaving with Hector

EXT WELL - DAY

Hector stands at the well some way from the house
Beatrices garden is a madness of wild flowers harvested
by her for scents and powders She is a remarkable
woman living as she does in the harsh male world of

her time The scented air and the dizzy SOUNDS OF the
BEES almost make Hector swoon He is experiencing the
full heady impact of Beatrice and it is summed up in

a full-blown pollen-filled sneeze

He drinks at her well The Boy is beside him still
engrossed in his new shoes Hector splashes some water
on his face and looks back at the house He has some
decisions to make

INT COTTAGE - DAY

The Mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to
a comfortable chair that the house has to offer She

is working on some lace Hector enters the room to
watch her He smiles and stands shyly at the door The
Mother thinks he wants her chair for himself In a
flurry of apology she rises drops her work and motions
for Hector to have the good seat He is full of
embarrassment

HECTOR
No no sit down I just came
to watch please sit

He guides the Mother back to the good chair They

struggle comically for a while but eventually she allows
Hector to settle her there She mumbles unhappily

( )

MOTHER
We cant have this this was
Arnauds seat its yours
now I can sit on the box
Hector gently pacifies her
HECTOR
You must sit there look
you need the light from the
window its your
seat I dont want it its
yours I can sit on the box

The old woman allows herself a shy smile Whether in
innocence or mischief she has secured the best seat in
the house for herself If he stays Hector will never
dare rest his bones in it

EXT YARD - DAY

Hector has retreated to the yard The Girl is

boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire The
Boy is working at a basketful of flower heads pulling
petals and separating the hearts putting them in a
large jar of colored liquid

Hector is aware of Beatrice watching him She is
returning to the kitchen firmly holding a struggling
chicken wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere
This chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in
Beatrices final effort at total seduction a wonderful
meal Hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes
meet briefly

Hector takes in what the Boy is doing and joins in
the work The Boy smiles at Hectors initial clumsiness
He motions for Hector to have a sniff of the jar of

liquid Hector does so The smell is heady and pleasant

HECTOR
Ah
The Boy says something and points towards his sister
She stands by her cauldron stirring the bubbling liquid
Hector goes to watch her work He looks in the cauldron
HECTOR
Good color for cloth

Without thinking Hector leans over the cauldron to
sniff A hideous odor assaults him He backs off

HECTOR
Ugh

The Girl says something to him and points to a bucket
of liquid at her feet Hector makes out something like
the word peepee

HECTOR
Peepee

The Girl nods enthusiastically The Boy is sniggering

INT COTTAGE - DAY

Hector sits at the table with Beatrice and her family
here is an air of awkward silence although the Boy
nd Girl look openly at Hector perhaps assessing him as
future father
he meal has been served in a communal pot In Beatrices
ouse there is the luxury of small individual plates
he others wait for Hector to begin but he indicates
o the old Mother to help herself first She does and
he doesnt stop until her plate is heaped high with
ood There is definitely some power play going on in
he old womans mind although her face is all innocence
ector submits taking only a modest portion of food
he old Mothers appetite is prodigious It is comical
o watch her little frame consume so much quietly
nd methodically She is an eating machine
uring the meal Beatrice and Hector exchange glances But
his time their talking without words is a serious affair
HECTOR
Mmmm good food

tCOM9tHBtewhonontcHeTsHoond

EXT COTTAGE - DAY

From the kitchen Beatrice watches Hector in the garden
he is making an effort to appear relaxed but as he
paces here and there Beatrice knows that he is unhappy
She leaves the kitchen to join him

BEATRICE
Take a walk to the village if
you want you look as if you

need a walk

Hector opens his heart to her knowing she will understand
his feelings if not his words

HECTOR
I have to leave soon I cant
stay it would be wrong to stay

for just a while

EXT COTTAGE - DAY

It is awkward for Hector to say goodbye

HECTOR
I have to go have to keep the
sun on my back I have to get
home I have a family just
like you I like you you
smell good wonderful

Hector fumbles awkwardly with his bag and then walks

off down the track He turns to look at Beatrice

She stands outside her house for a long time watching

him until he turns onto the main road and OUT OF SIGHT

The pain and the awkwardness in Beatrice and Hector

are specific but the scene of parting is timeless

Is this the ten millionth such parting or the billionth
It is one of them at any rate and a sad one

EXT RIVER - DUSK

Hector has reached the river but it is already growing
dark and the boatman has gone for the night Hector
sees the boat dragged out of the water

He sits down against the trunk of a large tree His

eyes begin to close

EXT RAFT - MORNING

Hector awakes He looks around him He is on a huge

raft made of ships timbers We have left our previous
Hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago This

Hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare

The huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together

There are over a hundred and fifty people perched on

them lying or squatting in sleep It is early morning
The sea is calm around them but the deep ocean swell is
still there to remind them of their predicament menacing
like a controlled anger

Hector is fully awake now sitting against some boxes
He speaks to ANDRE sitting close by

( )

93
Andre is Hectors slave still bound to him in service
through shipwreck and disaster Our Hector is now a
master Andre is a young Asian A quiet capable
intelligent man but with that same lost look in his

eyes that Hector had as a slave He too is far from
home

HECTOR
I had a wonderful dream I was

lying under a tree beside a river
I was dozing I heard the water
beautiful clear water I got up
and drank some I think I ate some

raspberries too

ANDRE
I would like some water
Hector looks around him at the squalid mass of distressed
humanity
HECTOR

God this is the worst the worst

Some figures rise and an argument takes place like
a domestic squabble We can hear some of their exchanges
WOMAN
Let me keep him they said well
find land in a day or so youre
evil
MAN
When theyre dead they go over the
side The place stinks enough
as it is

There is a flurry of movement amongst the figures then
a splash then a cry of a Woman The noise has awakened
others All over the raft figures are coming awake
sitting up taking in the new day and the dreadful
reality of their situation

Andre speaks to Hector

ANDRE
Do you think Ill still see
Europe

HECTOR

I think theres more chance of
me eating you Andre The more we see of the people their costumes weapons
mannerisms the easier we will place them in their
time They are survivors of a foundered ship some time
at the height of the great colonial empires The year
could be 1590 The place is the Indian Ocean

Hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft
closer to him He watches a man and woman The woman
URSULA still has her eyes closed sleeping on a pile of
canvas The man FRANCISCO stands beside her holding

a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray His eye
catches Hectors and they hold each others gaze for a
long time There is antipathy but also pain in their
look

A man DOM PAULO moves among the waking wretches He
speaks with authority
DOM PAULO
I think today will be the day
my friends Weve been in the
inshore currents since yesterday
Three crowns to the first one to
sight the coast God preserve us
all
Someone speaks from under a crude canvas shelter
SAILOR
Never mind the three crowns a
side of beef would do or a drink
of clean water

Dom Paulo strides off to his station by the makeshift
rudder
DOM PAULO
Dont worry therell be food for
all ashore Africas full of
meat and drink

SAILOR
Its full of Africans too

EXT RAFT - DAY

The sun is up and Dom Paulo was right The raft is

now standing off-shore riding out the heavy ocean surf

before finally beaching The strong are helping to row

ashore under the shouted instructions of the NAVIGATOR

Those too weak to help are huddled beside their posses-

sions hoping to survive this final trial of the sea

Hector works his oar with the rest He has time to cast
a glance at Ursula and Francisco Francisco in his
manic-heroic way manages to row while at the same time
trying to offer a steadying arm to Ursula

If Hector had time or energy to laugh he would

The raft is in the full rage of the surf The sense
behind its loose construction is obvious now Snake-like
it rides the waves one half up the other down The
beaching isnt easy A few people are washed overboard
with no way of saving them Finally the raft makes it
through the barrier of the outer surf They are ina
long curving bay Up from the beach lies an area of
dunes and beyond that a thick belt of jungle

The raft scrapes onto the sand Those near the beach
scramble ashore immediately prostrating themselves in
prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into

the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to safety
Hectors attention is never far from Ursula She is
struggling in the water with some of her baggage A
youth NUNO goes to help her Hector overtakes him and
nudges him out of the way offering to take Ursulas load
from her shoulders She refuses his help Waist-deep in
water they tussle over her bundle of possessions Hector
overpowers her wrestles her load from her grasp angrily
wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand In amongst
the drama of their situation their little battle of wills
seems petty and pathetic but it reveals much about their
past

Soon the survivors are dragging their possessions from
the raft They have managed to hoard a surprising amount
from their doomed ship Carpets chests chairs all

are dragged ashore

EXT CAMP - DAY

Civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner
of Africa Dom Paulo the leader already has a table
and chair set up in the sand and behind him SAILORS are
erectig a tent-like house made from timbers and rich
tapestries and carpets The others are making their own
shelters all along the beach A regular little community
is taking shape a crazy rich-textured village decked out
in all the colors of the East The silks and ginghams
that were destined for the finest halls in Europe now give
shelter to sick slaves starving sailors ruined traders
and grieving mothers

( )

Some of the survivors have recovered sufficiently from
the trauma of near death to mark out the boundaries of
their new beach homes with lines of stones The habits
of ownership die hardest of all

Although Dom Paulo is the man in authority he is also a
man in deep shock Most of what he has earned or
plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom
of the ocean Since he is socially superior to anyone
else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command
There are probably fifty men among the survivors more
suited to lead them to safety

By Dom Paulos side always is his SON A quiet boy of
about eleven He is like a little miniature of his
father dressed in the same style of clothes He is a
constant silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo does
good or bad wise or foolish He and his father are a
continuing fascination for Hector and we can enjoy
Hector watching the boy watching his father Some of the
absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high-
lighted in this way There can be sadness in it too
however the pain of a son witnessing his fathers
compromises or failures all too closely and Dom Paulos
sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his
sons eyes

Amidst the construction work Dom Paulo is talking with
some of his OFFICERS

DOM PAULO
How many made it

OFFICER
Eighty men Ten women Eighteen
children and forty-five slaves

DOM PAULO
Two parties of ten men each one
to the north and one to the south
bring back what you can game
fruit anything and send someone
back as soon as you find fresh
water Any trouble discharge
three shots

The Officer leaves to carry out his orders Dom Paulo
addresses another of his men Da Cunha
( )

DOM PAULO

Have the carpenter start
immediately on a cross a big
one Father Diogo wants a
place of worship by this time
tomorrow Well look for a
spot later Weve all got a lot
of praying to do And wheres
Dias tell him I want to see
him

EXT CAMP - DAY
Hector and Andre are walking through the half-built
village Andre is carrying Hectors possessions a
rolled-up carpet anda bolt of colorful cloth We feel
an echo of the days when Hector was a slave walking
two paces behind with his masters possessions
Hector finds what he is looking for Francisco is
working on a shelter for himself and Ursula with the
help of some slaves Hector approaches him making
another attempt to heal wounds from his past
HECTOR
I have a carpet and some cloth
I thought if we worked together
we could make a better shelter
Francisco barely stops his work to reply
FRANCISCO
If its a joke its a poor one

HECTOR
At least ask Dona Ursula

FRANCISCO
I dont have to ask her I know
she would agree with me leave us

alone
His stubborn rejection of Hector reveals just how
strong their friendship once was

HECTOR
Well would you take my cloth
at least

FRANCISCO
Keep it and build your own hovel
somewhere else leave us
alone
( )

96
Then from along the beach the sound of RAISED VOICES
distracts them They see some figures laden with
supplies running off into the forest Others are
following them discharging MUSKETS shouting for the
DESERTERS to stop Hector and Francisco walk briskly
in the direction of the trouble They see two of the
Deserters being overtaken by their pursuers The rest
make their escape into the jungle
EXT CAMP - DAY 97

Hector and Francisco reach Dom Paulos office in the
sand The leading citizens are gathering there as
the two captured Deserters are brought in

SAILOR
They ran off with the dry bread

about eight of them sir

Dom Paulo looks at the two prisoners
DOM PAULO
You men are deserters You will
die tomorrow
He speaks again to the Sailor
DOM PAULO
Chain them on the raft for tonight
and watch them

Francisco steps forward outraged

FRANCISCO
I must object these sentences
cant be lawful

Dom Paulos authoritative manner vanishes in an instant
He becomes hesitant unsure of himself As always his

Son watches every detail of the exchange

DOM PAULO
Do you think so

FRANCISCO
Of course we cant allow
ourselves to fall into terror
and violence

DOM PAULO
Youre right but then how can
we punish them We cant lock them
up
( )

97

Dom Paulo looks around at the assembled notables
confused out of his depth Other opinions are voiced

SALGADO
You were right the first time
sir they must hang they were
stealing the bread from our

mouths
The captured Deserters look on helplessly as their lives
are argued over

YOUNG DESERTER

I didnt steal any bread Gomes
had the bread hes off in the
forest
DOM PAULO
Oh dear
Dom Paulo turns to the Priest
DOM PAULO

What do you think Father
The Priest throws open his arms noncommittally

PRIEST
Ill comfort them whether they
live or die now or later any of

you all of you Ill comfort
you all

SALGADO
Hang them you have to set an
example

Dom Paulo is deeply confused

DOM PAULO
So I was right the first time

Francisco confuses him even more

FRANCISCO
No sir there must be proper
justice

DOM PAULO

Whats proper justice

DESERTER
I didnt steal any bread

SALGADO
You have to make a decision sir
DESERTER
It was Gomes he told us to run
DOM PAULO
Ill decide no I wont well
all decide most of the people
that matter are here well have
a vote who agrees with
Salgado and me that they

should die

A lot of hands go up Hector hesitates his instincts
are not for killing But the force of the majority
weighs on him He starts to raise his hand At that
moment as he scans the crowd he meets the eyes of the
Deserter whose death they are voting on For a moment
they communicate Hector is thrown He drops his hand
only to find in the next instant the stern gaze of
Salgado on him He hesitates again then starts to
raise his hand Then the eyes of the Deserter find him

once more

This comic pantomime goes on while a solid

majority of the crowd firmly raise their hands
DOM PAULO
and those against death

One of the Deserters raises his own hand meekly
DOM PAULO
You cant vote

Then he looks to Salgado
DOM PAULO
Can he
SALGADO
It doesnt matter

Then the other Deserter raises his hand too

SALGADO
I dont think this is working
Dom Paulo we need authority

you must decide
Dom Paulo thinks

DOM PAULO
Very well Da Cunha

97 97
DA CUNHA steps forward

DOM PAULO
The cross the carpenter is
working on tell him to turn
it into a scaffold have it
erected along the beach away
from the women the executions
will be at sunrise tomorrow Tell
Father Diogo

He turns to the Sailors holding the Deserters
DOM PAULO
Take them to the raft

The dazed Deserters are led off Dom Paulos face clouds
in doubt again
DOM PAULO
Everyone in agreement with hanging

Or should we shoot them or what
DA CUNHA
Hanging is fine sir

DOM PAULO

Very well now whos going
to conduct the executions
we pick someone or have a
volunteer

Dom Paulo looks over the faces of the men

Hector

DOM PAULO

Hector

should

He stops at

Hector doesnt have the will to accept or the courage to

refuse He is saved by another young man ALVAREZ eager

to prove himself

ALVAREZ

Ill do it Dom Paulo

DOM PAULO

Thank you Alvarez Sunrise
tomorrow Send the Priest to
them tonight

We can sense the feeling of relief in Hector Dom

Paulos son has been a silent witness to everything that

has happened but his blank face reveals nothing of his

feelings

EXT CAMP - EVENING
It is growing dark Fires are being lit outside
shelters Andre is building Hectors tent while
watches him The tent is only large enough for

person and somehow looks mean compared with the

HECTOR

Good work Andre

the

Hector
one

others

He looks across to the well-made shelter of Ursula and
Francisco Ursula herself works at the fire

Hector turns to Andre

HECTOR

You go and sleep by the big fire

Andre

Keep warm

Andre leaves

INT CAMP - NIGHT 99
Hector goes inside his little house He puts his back
to the entrance and opens the canvas sack which contains
all his possessions He pulls out his prize a sizeable
chunk of bread and some dried fruit He guiltily gnaws
at the hard bread
He is surprised by the sound of the boy Nuno outside
NUNO
Senor Hector
Hector quickly stows his food back into his sack and
with a grunt of irritation sticks his head out of the
shelter
Nuno is holding four fruits about the size of large
apples but green and thick-skinned
NUNO
This was all they found in the
forest Four for each of us
They taste kind of milky but
sour
HECTOR
Thank you Nuno
NUNO
My mother ate three and she was
sick So try two but shes
sick anyway maybe you can try
three
( )

99

HECTOR
Ill start with two

Nuno makes to leave but then hesitates
NUNO
Hector will you help me

Nuno is looking down the beach
raft on the shoreline The sha

chained there can just be seen

NUNO

Lopo the boy t
hang tomorrow

to the remains of the
pes of the two Deserters

heyre going to
he was cooks

cabin boy I was going to take

him something to eat I thought

perhaps one of yours and one of

mine

He looks at the fruit he has just given Hector

NUNO

You said you might just eat two
HECTOR

But theres tomorrow Nuno we

must eat tomorrow too

Nuno looks disappointed His eyes turn again to his
playmate tied to the raft
HECTOR

Dom Paulo would call it a waste

You must keep yourself strong Nuno

thats what hed say so that you
can help the others God knows
what we have ahead of us well

need strong people like you
Nuno is silent unconvinced

HECTOR
Try not to think about Lopo any
more The guards wouldnt let

you near him anyway

Nuno stomps away in silence Hector shouts after him
cheerily
HECTOR
Goodnight

100 INT CAMP - NIGHT 100

In the privacy of their tent Dom Paulo and his son are
engaged in their nightly ritual practicing on their
recorders Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an
intricate pretty tune They sit formally and there is
an air of stoicism about them determined as they are
to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of
circumstances But there is also a feeling of madness
about it The madness of a man who has lost a grip of
what is going on about him Down on the beach men are
waiting to die in the morning on his orders The blend
of formality and madness make the scene comic

101 EXT CAMP - DAWN 101

The sun has risen sharply soaring out of the ocean It
blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party
making their way along the beach

The cross-cum-scaffold has been erected some way from the
camp Most people are attending to their morning

chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being
carried out along the shore

Our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the
camp marionette figures men dancing on ropes the form-
ality of legal death The priest and the executioners

It takes a while for the people in the camp to become
aware of the other observers up on the dunes Three
figures stand in full view boldly silently watching
the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold

The word passes around the camp Eyes pass between the
executions and the tall natives watching The first man
is already dangling on the rope by the time that Dom Paulo
and his officers are discussing the appearance of the
natives

DA CUNHA
Some gunpowder would scatter them
sir

DOM PAULO

No they might want to be
friendly theyll have food

too get one of our African
slaves we must try and talk to
them If they think were timid

were dead

EXT DUNES - DAWN 102
A solitary SLAVE makes his way up from the camp to the
natives on the dunes Everyone in the camp watches as he
approaches them There is tension Will the natives run
or fight or talk They begin to talk The natives seem
most interested in the hangings and point in that
direction asking questions The Slave makes an attempt
at explaining what is happening but the natives seem
baffled They start laughing and shaking their heads

By now the second figure is dangling on the rope the
cross making an efficient double-gallows

EXT CAMP - DAWN 103
While Franciscos attention has been on the natives
Hector has sidled up to him still hoping to ingratiate
himself He talks while they watch the two events the
hanging and the meeting

HECTOR

hate it when people have to die

FRANCISCO
ts foolishness Killing our
own men when we have the whole of
Africa to face
HECTOR
ts foolish squabbling at all
We should be friends
Francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is
saying Hector shrugs He takes a small bundle from
his jacket and gives it to Francisco
FRANCISCO

Whats this

HECTOR
Some bread and raisins

FRANCISCO
I thought everything was shared
out on the raft

HECTOR
Well this wasnt Its for her
and you
Francisco looks Hector straight in the eye looking for
his angle But this time there is none Hector is

simply a lonely man seeking to retrieve lost friendship
There is a glimmer of sympathy in Franciscos face
( )

On the high dunes the Slave and the natives have now
parted company The Deserters still spin at the end of
their ropes the Priest praying at their feet

Francisco walks away from him Hector calls out

HECTOR
I must speak to her

EXT CAMP - DAY

The Slave approaches Dom Paulo outside his tent

SLAVE
They want to make a visit here
with their King he will bring

gifts and will receive gifts

They said not to sacrifice anymore

men for them they dont like
that
Dom Paulo and the others laugh

EXT BAY - DAY

The tide is sweeping more wreckage into the bay Barrels

and boxes and timber bob in the waves People make their

way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from the
sea

The whole of the camp is eager and shouting They bring

in the boxes and barrels A whole harmonium is man-
handled ashore Some boys drag it up onto dry sand and
start to work its bellows At first only water spurts
from it but then a watery note or two is emitted The
mood soon becomes festive Dom Paulo makes his way down

to the shore to make the celebrations official

By now the first of the newly-arrived crates are being
opened Inside are eggs many many large eggs in
crate after crate

An OFFICER brings the first of the eggs to Dom Paulo

OFFICER
Turtles eggs sir Doctor Correa
was shipping them to the Royal
Zoo I think they hoped some of
them would hatch

DOM PAULO
Well its eggs for supper
tonight for everyone

EXT CAMP - DUSK 106

That night everyone does eat turtles eggs At their
fires in the dusk they fry them boil them scramble
them Some eat them raw The abundant green fruits
make a tolerable side dish The happy mood of the
afternoon has survived into the night For once there
is enough to eat and the hangings are a thing of the
past Above the ROAR of the constantly rolling SURF
the CROAKY sounds of the waterlogged HARMONIUM can be
heard

INT HECTORS TENT - DUSK 107
Sadly for Hector the harmonium enthusiast is very close

to his shelter The JANGLY MUSIC is loud and insistent

Hector removes six large eggs from a bag and takes them
outside to his fire

EXT CAMP - DUSK 108
Andre is there eating the last of his omelette
HECTOR
How are they
ANDRE
Good

Hector cracks one of his eggs into a copper pan Inside
is a brown smudge of dried yoke and some dust Hector

grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg The yoke is
discolored and the smell is rank Hector looks at Andre
rapidly finishing his omelette before Hector can demand

it
HECTOR
Yours were fine
ANDRE
Yes

Hector picks up a third egg and shakes itclose to his
ear It seems as empty as the other two He picks up

a fourth egg and cracks it open A small dried-up half-
formed baby turtle RATTLES into the pan Andre is
quietly enjoying Hectors frustration He stands up to
leave

ANDRE
Good night
( )

HECTOR
Have you any eggs left

ANDRE
The slaves only got three I want

to ask you something
HECTOR

You were lucky What
ANDRE

I want my real name back
HECTOR

You dont like Andre anymore

ANDRE
I think of my home all the time
I want to hear the name they call
me We should die with our real
names

HECTOR
Were not going to die Andre

Hector smiles at his own insensitivity

HECTOR

Ive forgotten your name
ANDRE

Ketabomago Pululo
HECTOR

Now I remember why we called you

Andre

Andre looks at him expectantly

HECTOR
I will Andre I promise Ill
call you that when I remember
Andre is satisfied and leaves Hector calls to him
HECTOR
Good night Keta
ANDRE

Ketabomago Pululo

HECTOR
Yes good night

108 Hector is alone Hector gives up on the eggs and pulls
out his store of bread and fruit from the tent The
next source of annoyance is the continuing noise of the
HARMONIUM

He shouts across to the musical enthusiast a YOUTH
with a few older children by his side

HECTOR

EXT CAMP -

Hey Stop that will you Think
of the older people and the
sick Ill give you an egg if

you stop here

NEXT MORNING

The Officers and Dom Paulo are selecting items for barter

from their crates and boxes of valuables Hector and
other notables are also there

Cheap goods

common beads

a box of rosaries and crucifixes made of

for example are being gone through and

suitable junk selected for gifts
They talk as they work

DOM PAULO
How many are sick
DA CUNHA
About fifty sir some of them
very sick indeed Its the eggs
A couple of the crates were full of

rotten ones but eaten just the

same Others just ate too many
It would have been better to ration
them I suppose

DOM PAULO
How wise of you to think of that
now Any deaths

DA CUNHA
Six
DOM PAULO
How many eggs did you have

DA CUNHA
Three I had them boiled
DOM PAULO
I had four I dont feel well

now

DA CUNHA
Fours all right the really ill
ones had eaten eight ten

DOM PAULO
Lets not think about it what

have you got

Salgado comes forward with a handful of the broken
remains of a kettle Copper is a useful currency
SALGADO
It worked well theyll go for
this and nails Luis cleaned
up a sackful from the crates
Salgado shows a handful of nails from a small sack in his
hand
DOM PAULO
Organize some men to gather all

the nails they can find We have
to keep control of that particular
currency
Dom Paulo rummages in a box of cheap rosaries selects a
couple and then retires to his tent The others work
on at the table Hector drifts off down to the beach

INT DOM PAULOS TENT - MORNING

Inside his tent Dom Paulo goes to his small mirror He
takes off the heavy silver chain and medallion from
around his neck and a valuable brooch from his coat He
stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its
hiding place in the sand floor Then he adorns himself
in the cheap rosary and other trashy items Dom Paulo

catching sight of his watching Son in the mirror holds

a silencing finger to his mouth

EXT BEACH - MORNING

Hector is walking along the beach close to a pile of

discarded boxes and crates

111
He quickly searches through them He soon finds what he

is looking for a piece of wood with some nails still
attached to it He pulls out the nails and pockets them
then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more
Hector is a survivor And not the first Hector to
scavenge on a beach in a world that feels big and empty

EXT DUNES - MORNING 112
Hector is enjoying the freshness of the day We see

him climb over a dune and then as he nears the summit
duck and retreat down the slope again Cautiously he
crawls up the dune and looks over to the other side

He is watching a young Girl and the boy Nuno They are
twelve or thirteen years old They are coyly in the
early stages of making love the Boy lying close to the
Girl kissing her beginning to caress her Their

love-making is poised oddly between childs play and

eroticism Its their day of discovery and it is like

a dream of love

The Boy is just about to discover some more and is
fumbling with the Girls clothing when he looks up and
catches sight of Hector Hector ducks down but knows he
has been seen and decides to brazen it out He stands

up in full view of them

HECTOR
Stop that leave her alone
get back to the camp or Ill tell
your mother how can you play like

this when there are people needing

your help back there
The Boy is standing now and fixing his clothing He walks
off back to the camp The Girl remains sitting in the
sand buttoning her dress too embarrassed even to raise
her head to Hector

Then Hector is touched by something perhaps the sad stoop
in the Boys shoulder or the Girls lowered head Hector
realizes he has broken something precious and in their
circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable He
feels like an oaf He calls after the Boy

HECTOR

Come back I didnt mean it

it was a joke you come back
shes still here I wont say
anything

But the Boy walks on turning around now and then to look
at Hector who feels foolish and mean Hector calls down
to the Girl
HECTOR
Im sorry

But she doesnt look up still fumbling with her buttons
Hector curses quietly and looks out across the dunes
angry with himself Then he sees the procession of the

Native King and his people some cattle and porters
carrying baskets
Hector runs off towards the camp

EXT CLEARING - DAY
The meeting of the two leaders is weird and wonderful

to see The ragged Europeans already scanning the

baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food
somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own

importance for the occasion The Natives excited and
curious trying to contain their exuberance so that they

dont miss a single detail of this most significant
day Many of the Natives have climbed into the trees

either out of timidity or to get a better view

The trees around the meeting place are dripping with
bodies like human fruit
Hector slips into the crowd as the NATIVE KING is in
mid-speech When he has stopped talking the Slave begins
to haltingly translate
SLAVE
He was excited when he heard you
had come but he wants to know

if you are real people he
didnt think you would be such
a strange color so he wants
to see your

He points repeatedly at his navel

SLAVE
so that he will know that you
were born like real people

Dom Paulo wont suffer the indignity alone He talks to

the Officers standing closest to him

DOM PAULO
Right you four as well

He begins to open up his coat and shirt The four
Officers do the same The King and a few of his atten-
dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed
white European bellies They look at one another and
mumble solemnly Then they step back Dom Paulo and the
Officers fix their clothing and re-muster their dignity
The King is enjoying himself He speaks again to the
Slave who then translates

SLAVE
He wants to see you breathe
The King takes a deep breath then nods to Dom Paulo
Dom Paulo and the Officers do as they are told The King
joins them and for a few moments there is a kind of
communion between them Then everyone joins in It is a

strange poignant moment all the Natives and all the
Europeans united in the simple act of breathing

Dom Paulo regains his composure He speaks to the Slave
DOM PAULO

Tell him that we want to trade

with him to buy food and we

want him to guide us out of here

we have a long way to travel to

where the white men have their

big ships

The Slave speaks to the King The King listens and talks
back for a long time Then the Slave translates again
SLAVE

He has heard of white men very

very far away this way
but you have to cross many rivers
twenty big rivers

DOM PAULO
Tell him I want to give him these
Dom Paulo steps forward to the King An Officer brings

a wrapped cloth Dom Paulo opens it letting the King
see the pieces of broken copper inside The Officer produces a handful of large nails and
gives them directly to the King The King nods his
head in approval and shows the nails to his attendants
They are impressed
DOM PAULO
and tell him that I want to

make him a very special gift as

one King to another
Various Officers raise their eyebrows at this

DOM PAULO
Of these precious things which my
fathers and forefathers have worn
for many long years before

Dom Paulo solemnly and without a blush removes the cheap
rosary from around his neck and offers it to the King
DOM PAULO
I shouldnt do this but it is
such a special occasion and he is
such a great and worthy King
This is translated The King refuses to accept the

rosary Instead he is pointing to a couple of chunky
and valuable-looking rings on Dom Paulos fingers which
he has forgotten to remove
SLAVE

He says he could not accept such

a treasured gift something of

such value to your family

instead he would be happy to take

one or two of the old rings you have

on your fingers but please do

not insist that he take your

necklace
It is impossible to know if the King is being naively
polite or hugely clever Dom Paulos Officers enjoy a
muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and
gives them to the King replacing the worthless baubles
around his own neck The King begins talking again
The Slave translates

SLAVE
He will give you guides to help

you across the first of the big

rivers it is ten days from
here
( ) DOM PAULO

Thank you thank you

The Slave continues
SLAVE
and he asks you to be ready
to leave the beach in two days
time he cannot permit you to
stay longer

Dom Paulo looks shocked
SLAVE

Because with the new moon the

turtles will arrive and lay

their eggs you may frighten

them you must be gone
The mention of turtles eggs almost turns the stomachs
of most of the survivors even the fit ones
The King and his followers walk back into the forest

Soon the survivors are alone again with the lost-
looking cow the Natives have left A doomed cow if
ever there was

EXT BEACH - EVENING

The remains of the cow hang on the spit over the large
fire the survivors have made on the beach Small groups
of people sit around it gnawing on the roasted flesh

The image is once again timeless the elements of it
simple man fire flesh food

One cow doesnt go far between a hundred starving people
Some are still on their feet by the large fire Now and
then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a
bone hanging loose or a tasty-looking piece of gristle
They are the survivors of the pack if any will be

Hector is of course among them He risks the searing
heat to pull at a couple of blackened bones He sees
Nuno the boy he chased away from the Girl earlier in
the day Nuno is sitting by himself staring vacantly
at the fire licking his fingers

Hector sits down in the sand beside him Nuno hardly
notices him until Hector offers him one of his bones
Nuno grabs it

NUNO
Thanks
( )

HECTOR
Suck out the marrow its the
best bit

Nuno follows Hectors example Hector allows him to
feel the benefit of his gift before he starts to talk

HECTOR
Im sorry about today
NUNO
It doesnt matter
HECTOR
But it does it was mean of
me I was upset at something
I wasnt really angry at you
NUNO
I know
Nuno is taking it rather well Hector regains his
natural self-confidence

HECTOR

You dont think too badly of me
NUNO

No
HECTOR

You still like me
Nuno shyly nods his head

HECTOR
You do
NUNO
Yes
Hector is satisfied now
HECTOR

Well that makes me feel better
we all have to like each other
and respect each other thats
important too

They are silent for a moment

HECTOR
If you dont respect me just
say SO Nuno looks at him smiling weakly Then he turns away
in silence Hector tries another approach to win the
Boy over
HECTOR
I have a boy like you maybe

you could meet him when we get

home
This doesnt produce much of a response Hector tries
again He starts to chuckle to himself and nudges Nuno
in the ribs

HECTOR
You can take her back there
tomorrow eh

Nuno shakes his head
NUNO
No shes sick now

EXT CAMP - NIGHT

Dom Paulo and the Priest and some of the Officers are
having a more formal meal at Dom Paulos table outside

his shelter An argument is in progress between Dom
Paulo and GASPAR DIAS the navigator

Gasper Dias has drawn a rough map which lies on the
table

DOM PAULO
Cant you be more accurate
Hector comes to the meeting He sits down on a box
near the table and watches and listens his expression
changing with the shifts in mood of the others This

is Hector the social animal our Hector with his pockets

full of stolen nails and his tent full of stashes of
food
DIAS

How can I be accurate without

instruments As it is Im

sighting the sun with two pieces

of wood Call it five hundred

and be done with it he said

twenty rivers

DOM PAULO
We just want you to be as accurate
as we know you can be Dias After
all the ship did manage to find
that rock with admirable precision

DIAS

Confound you Dom Paulo thats an
insult she hit that rock because
she was taking water and
unsteerable She was overloaded
before she left India and you know
ite

Dias pounds his fist on the table

DIAS
Ive told you we vote fora

leader or you can walk into the
jungle on your own it should

have been done days ago

DA CUNHA
Calm down Dias you cant stay
here forever living on turtles

eggs

There are mock groans and laughter at the thought of it

The tension

for the moment is broken

DA CUNHA
What about the sick and the
injured Dom Paulo

Dom Paulo lets out a heavy sigh

Dias mumbles

EXT CAMP -

Hector is
He passes
Francisco

DOM PAULO
Ive discussed it with Father
Diogo I dont see how a hundred

of us can carry seventy sick

FATHER DIOGO
Im going to search the scriptures
tonight Im sure that God has
an answer to it

DIAS
An excuse you mean well be
leaving them here to die

SALGADO
Oh so youre coming with us now
Dias

to himself
DIAS

After the vote

FATHER DIOGO
It might be the best we can offer
them now the chance to die a
good Christian death here and set
an example to the heathens

NIGHT

making his way in the dark back to his shelter
close to the tent of Francisco and Ursula
is outside by the fire An impulse takes

Hector to join him

HECTOR
Ill be glad when were on the
move the sound of the sea is

driving me mad

FRANCISCO
Good night Hector
Hector lingers

HECTOR
Where is Ursula Sleeping
FRANCISCO
Sick She hasnt been able to
rise since yesterday

Hectors face expresses his shock From what he has
heard at the meeting this is serious news He makes a
decision He speaks to Francisco willing their old
friendship back into existence in the urgency of the
moment

HECTOR
Will you share a bottle of wine
with me Ive had it since we
left the ship I want to drink
it tonight with you
This offer has found a chink in Franciscos armor

FRANCISCO

You have a bottle of wine

HECTOR

Yes

FRANCISCO

Well fetch it

EXT CAMP - NIGHT

Hector has returned with his precious bottle Francisco

by some miracle has two fine crystal glasses As they

drink they begin to reveal a hint of their old intimacy
FRANCISCO

You should hang for this Some
people on the raft might have
lived with a glass of this in
their stomach
Francisco sips the wine with the relish of long
abstinence
HECTOR
I know I feel very guilty I
brought this too

Hector pulls a cotton bag from under his coat

HECTOR
Honeyed fruit The last I have
Francisco cant believe such food still exits He
smiles in anticipation
FRANCISCO
You rogue give it here

Francisco grabs at the bag and stuffs two or three
sweets into his mouth not so much the gentleman now

HECTOR
I brought it for Ursula
Francisco talks through his munching

FRANCISCO
Much too rich for her do you want
to kill her

HECTOR
Surely some fruit couldnt

FRANCISCO
Dont argue with me old friend
youre the guilty one around here
and dont you forget it

HECTOR
Why is it always me Why am I
always guilty always sorry am
I so bad

FRANCISCO

With Ursula you werent bad you
were stupid you did the one thing
you cant do to a strong woman
you took away her pride what else

can she do but hate you

Hector is

Franciscos face breaks into a smile They drink the

rest of the bottle in silence

silent

FRANCISCO
And then you get on the same ship
what a fool

HECTOR

I had to get home just like you

FRANCISCO
And when the ship went down why
did you have to get on the same
raft it was as if you were trying
to torment her
HECTOR
But the other raft was sinking
FRANCISCO

HECTOR

Francisco please

friendship having gone beyond words

EXT MASS - DAY

the complexity of their

On a headland overlooking the bay Father Diogos mass is

in progress Every fit member of the camp
a good many of the sick have been carried
The harmonium has been carried
and is in full voice

take part

is there
in litters to
up the hill
some youths dissipating their

and

precious energy on its bellows The younger boys have
been organized into a choir

The large cross stands behind Father Diogo held
by a cairn of piled stones at its base When we

in place
FIND

Hector there is something tantalizingly familiar about it
all the cliffs the ocean the kneeling Hector a pile
of stones the offering to a god

EXT CLEARING - DAY

The natives have gathered nearby They have been moved
perhaps by the music or perhaps by the simple universal
posture of worship itself They begin to sing a low
rhythmic compelling chant It mingles with the distant
voice of Father Diogo and then with the chanting voices

of all the Europeans until it seems that the whole
world is praying

EXT CAMP - MORNING

Next morning the camp on the beach is being broken up
The place is like a junkyard The amount of damage that
a hundred and fifty people can do to a beach in two days
is impressive Dom Paulo and the officers watch the work
With them are some messengers from the king and the
Slave translator
One of the messengers is talking When he finishes the
Slave translates
SLAVE
Yes they will look after the
sick but the King would like
one thing the machine that
makes music
DOM PAULO
We need food as well ten
cows to take with us then

the King can have the music

EXT CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - MORNING

Hector is sitting beside Nuno on a box talking earnestly
to him Andre stands beside them

HECTOR
You must come with us

NUNO
No

ANDRE
Your mother might not get well
do you understand that

NUNO
Thats why I have to stay

HECTOR
And afterwards what will you
do then

NUNO
Follow you and the others
HECTOR
Alone

Nuno remains silent
ANDRE
Let him be

EXT CAMP - DAY

Dom Paulo and Father Diogo are standing beside Dom
Paulos table all that remains of his headquarters on
the beach

FATHER DIOGO
Ill comfort them as best as I
can
DOM PAULO
Youre staying with them
Father Diogo hastens to correct this misunderstanding

FATHER DIOGO
No no Ill comfort them before
we leave I think my place is
with you
Two sailors like stagehands enter and remove the table
leaving Dom Paulo and Father Diogo propless on the beach

EXT JUNGLE PATH - DAY

The trek from the beach to the village has started A
long line of people including some local natives carry

the sick in crudely-made litters Even this short trip
is hard Somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the
harmonium up the jungle path

Just behind them Hector is helping Nuno to carry his
Mother ina litter It is like a civilization on the

move In a day or two the wind and the sea will have

rubbed out all evidence of their stay and the bay will
welcome its regular tenants the turtles

EXT NATIVE VILLAGE - DAY 124

There is a sense of bustle in the native village as the
European sick are settled into their huts and the others
prepare to depart Emotional farewells take place in

dark corners of the small huts A group of unmoved
sailors are playing cards in the dirt

In amongst the bustle Hector is looking for Francisco
He finds him taking some of his possessions into a hut

HECTOR
Francisco I have to see her

before we leave
FRANCISCO
Ill ask her
Francisco goes into the hut Hector waits outside
watching the small human dramas all around him Soon
Francisco emerges from the hut

FRANCISCO
In you go
Hector goes into the hut stooping low at the small
entrance

INT HUT - DAY 125
Ursula is lying in a darkened corner Hector is shaken
by the sight of her ashen and fevered but tries not to

show it He kneels beside her

HECTOR
Ursula its Hector
She turns her eyes to him but doesnt speak

HECTOR
Were leaving soon Ive come to
say goodbye

Her voice is a whisper

125

URSULA
Goodbye

HECTOR
I wont forget you I wont
forget India I cant forget
how I hurt you

She looks at him but doesnt or cannot speak
HECTOR

We should have talked I could
have explained many things
She manages a whispered word

URSULA

Lisbon

HECTOR

Yes Ill pray for you in

Lisbon at the Cathedral

She lies still Hector lingers for a moment Then he

speaks again
HECTOR

m sorry I hurt your pride

Hector has blown it Ursula pulls herself up on an
elbow finding wells of energy from sheer indignation
Hector is astonished almost jumping out of his skin
URSULA
What What did you say What are
you talking about

HECTOR
Nothing nothing
Ursula speaks one word and then falls back into a dead
faint
URSULA
Idiot

She lies still Hector leans over her to make sure she
is still breathing He whispers nervously
HECTOR

Ursula

126 EXT HUT - DAY 126
Outside the hut Dom Paulo is talking with Francisco

DOM PAULO
We wont forget you or what you
are doing for these poor people

FRANCISCO
Im not staying here with the
intention of dying Dom Paulo
well be following you when we
are fit and well

DOM PAULO
Yes of course

FRANCISCO
and good luck to you

They make what they both know is their final parting

DOM PAULO
God protect you it breaks my

heart to leave you all here but
I dont know what else I can do
They shake hands

DOM PAULO
Were leaving the cross with
you

FRANCISCO

Oh thank you

DOM PAULO
Its too heavy to carry and who
knows it might make some
impression on the heathens
Hector comes out of the hut solemn-faced

HECTOR
Francisco I must talk to you
alone

EXT HUT - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

Hector takes Francisco by the arm and leads him behind
the hut

FRANCISCO
Youve made your peace with her

HECTOR
Yes I think so

FRANCISCO
Thank God Well goodbye

HECTOR
Is there anything that I can do
for you A letter a message

Francisco laughs softly

FRANCISCO
No if you were carrying

something for me I would have to

worry about you if you go

empty-handed I can put you out of

my mind
Hector smiles uncertainly unsure if Francisco is making
a joke Then he becomes more serious

HECTOR
I want to ask you something

Theres no easy way to do it
FRANCISCO
Go on Hector

HECTOR
Your boots

Francisco looks down at his boots

FRANCISCO
What about them

HECTOR

Can I have them You can have

mine theyll be fine for

here but I have to walk six

hundred miles
Hector lifts a foot to show Francisco his boot Francisco
is stunned into silence But then a smile comes to his

face

FRANCISCO
Yes youre right I daresay

my boots would take you six hundred
miles I look after them

Hector becomes almost poetic in his pleading

127 HECTOR
Ill walk all the way home
Francisco Ill pray for your
soul in the Cathedral in Lisbon
FRANCISCO
In my boots

HECTOR
Yes

Francisco starts to laugh out loud

FRANCISCO
Hector you have surpassed
yourself sit down and take my

boots
Francisco starts to take off his boots Hector does the

same He cant believe his luck At this moment he

loves Francisco He makes nonsensical small talk
hopping around on one foot
HECTOR
They were made by Da Fosca
werent they
Francisco is giggling now

FRANCISCO
The best bootmaker in Goa pray
for my soul in Lisbon Hector

and pray for your own

Francisco is laughing but Hector doesnt get the joke

EXT FOREST - DAY

A different forest A wilderness of giant pines ranging
through the mountains for hundred of miles It is late

in the year There is one human sound in the cold still-

ness a voice singing
BOBBY the owner of the voice has a pack on his back

He is making his way up a steep slope to an area of flat
ground He stops singing looks around and calls out

in a powerful voice

BOBBY
Theyve gone long gone

Bobby looks around the abandoned camp the dead fires
cleared areas for tents

Up the slope and INTO VIEW comes his companion leading
a laden pack horse It is Hector

HECTOR
How long
BOBBY
Theyve been gone a week at
least
HECTOR
Damn them
BOBBY

Were ten days late

They look at each other They are in trouble and now
they know it
BOBBY
Cheer up Have a look around
Ill start on a fire

129 EXT CAMPSITE - DAY

Hector has scoured the campsite He holds up a canteen
he has found

HECTOR
Its Sandys whiskey
BOBBY
Well done my lad
Hector walks to the fire pleased with himself Bobby
unfolds his fist and looks at what he has found an
Indian arrowhead with a few inches of broken shaft He
folds his hand over it again keeping his secret
Behind them nailed to a tree is a plaque their
companions have left It reads Pennsylvania Boundary

Expedition 1761 Marker 152 Also on the plaque someone
has written We left here 20th October

130 EXT CAMP - NIGHT

Hector and Bobby sit by the fire with their supper They
are both anxious but pretend not to be

130 130
BOBBY
Even if we lose their track well
still hit the river we cant
miss that
HECTOR
Its too high for Indians
BOBBY
Much too high You wont find an
Indian up here We just have to
keep our heads no panic
HECTOR
If you did find an Indian what
would he be
BOBBY
You wouldnt but he might be a

Delaware if you did

HECTOR
We keep working

BOBBY
Why not We can log the peaks on
the far side just a couple of
sightings a day keep us busy

Their forced tone of matter-of-factness only serves to
heighten the growing feeling of doom

HECTOR
You think well get out
BOBBY
If we keep our heads I wish I

had some tobacco
EXT CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT 131

Hector is lying awake watching Bobbys sleeping form on
the ground at the other side of the dying fire Behind
Bobby is a wolf sniffing and edging his way closer to
them Hector isnt anxious He knows the wolf will soon
become aware of them and move off He is worried about
something else From under the pack that makes his

pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow a shaft and some
feathers the other end of Bobbys find He looks at it
then looks back to Bobby and the wolf

EXT CAMP - MORNING 132
In the morning Hector and Bobby are taking readings from

the instruments they have hung on a large tree main-

taining the disciplines of their work It gives some

shape and meaning to their predicament

BOBBY
Barometer twenty-eight and
three-eighths temperature

low thirty-four high
forty-two and a half time

Hector writes it in the log book Bobby goes to the

horse and takes a brass chronometer from a box strapped
to the saddle Hector takes out a smaller chronometer
from his own pack They compare readings There is a
difference of some four or five minutes in the time

BOBBY
Its getting worse youre
nearly five minutes fast now
HECTOR

Im not fast youre slowing
down
They obviously have this tiff every morning
HECTOR

Whats the point of having two
chronometers when you dont take
the average

BOBBY

Exactly you should throw yours

away
HECTOR

Youre unscientific Bobby at

heart

Hector writes in the book He speaks pointedly

HECTOR

Seven twenty-five

Bobby mocks him with a laugh

133 EXT FOREST - DAY 133
Bobby is leading the horse and Hector walks on ahead
The going is easy through the ferns and grasses Bobby

for a moment forgets his apprehensions and starts to sing
loudly

133

BOBBY
I see her in the dewy flowers
I see her sweet and fair
His voice rings sharply around the forest Hector far
ahead turns around taken by surprise Bobby has
frightened himself too He eyes the forest all around
as the echo of his voice fades Chastened he begins
to sing again quietly this time under his breath
BOBBY
Theres not a bonny bird that sings
But minds me o my Jean

134 EXT CLEARING - DAY 134

Hector and Bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock
looking out across the broad valley

They are building a pile of stones a cairn They work
quietly methodically The only sounds are of their
breathing and the CLICK-CLACK of the stones We feel the
echoes of our many previous Hectors and their piles of
stones built for this or that purpose Our doomed
surveyors are acting out the same ritual this time in
the name of science

They finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over
it and dangle a plumb line from the tripod Bobby
scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn
They are establishing a survey point They talk as they
work

When they anchor their tripod the cold hard sound of
their CHISELS STRIKING ROCK ECHOES all through the forest

It unnerves them They stop hammering and listen to the
ECHO BOUNCING down the valley
HECTOR

Sure this is a good idea

BOBBY
Lets get out of here

They hastily dismantle the equipment and load up the
horse in an atmosphere of controlled panic

EXT FOREST - DAY 135

They are travelling together now on either side of the
horses nose finding comfort in the closeness of each
other They stop for Bobby to consult his compass

He indicates a slight change of direction and they move
off again Still they dont talk We can feel their
anxiety breeding in the silence Why dont they talk
They proceed in this weighty silence but even the CRIES
of the BIRDS now seem to mock them

The route takes them downhill The slopes are more dense
with undergrowth now and the going isnt so easy Some-
times they are reduced to an undignified scramble hanging
onto the bulk of the horse between them They no longer
look much like conquerors of the wilderness
136 EXT FOREST - DAY 136

They are on the valley floor now The trees are more
openly spaced and the grass is richer They are moving
quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on
the trot It hasnt seen grass this good in weeks

137 EXT FOREST - DAY 137
They are moving more slowly the ground is rockier and
the trees are thickening They take the easy way up the
hillside a natural path made by deer or bear
t is difficult to know who is more shaken by their
encounter the Indian or Hector and Bobby
The INDIAN is sitting behind a tree as they pass dozing
or deep in reverie They almost pass without noticing
him but Hector gives a turn of his head and there is the
ndian four feet from him At the same instant the Indian
comes to his senses and sits bolt upright The encounter
is high comedy but full of terror for all of them

fq

The Indian stands up Hector absurdly greets him
HECTOR

Hi Hello

The Indian backs off from them holding his hands up and

smiling crazily as if to say Dont mind me boys Im

just leaving Hector and Bobby are equally silly in

their response

HECTOR
Hey come back were just
moving through dont
apologize we all got a fright
goodbye
( )

137

The Indian is in full retreat now waving his hands about
apologetically but making good distance from them
Suddenly he is gone It has happened so quickly that
Hector and Bobby scarcely believe it has happened Then
they realize that in their fright they have let go of the
horse It has headed back down to the tastier pastures
in the valley They see it disappearing into the trees
below them

BOBBY
That was stupid
HECTOR
Did you see him

BOBBY
Sure I saw him
HECTOR
Was he a Delaware
BOBBY
How the fuck should I know He
was an Indian and Indians dont
come in ones
HECTOR
Yeah I think he was an Indian
too What about the horse
BOBBY
Im not going back down there
HECTOR
Dont panic Bobby
BOBBY
Why not
He runs off into the forest Then he turns and shouts to
Hector

BOBBY
Come on

Hector follows him a mad race through the forest

138 EXT FOREST - DAY

Hector and Bobby are sitting on a rock gathering their
wits It is odd how they talk so matter-of-factly
HECTOR
What did you see

138

BOBBY

Same as you
HECTOR

An Indian with long hair
BOBBY

Thats it kind of short
HECTOR

Yeah he wast tall

BOBBY
Thats the one

Hector scans the hills above them

HECTOR

Lets get a bit further up

They move off Bobby looks at Hectors backpack

BOBBY

Whatve you got in there
HECTOR

Some food the logbooks my

letters a candle

BOBBY
A gun
HECTOR
No
EXT CAMP - DAY 139

They have stopped to make camp It is late afternoon
the sky just darkening sharp shadows on the far peaks a
purple glow in the air

BOBBY
We wont have a fire tonight We
should make a shelter though in
case it snows

HECTOR
What about bears without a fire

Bobby laughs quietly

BOBBY
Dont even think about bears Hector

EXT CAMP - NIGHT

They are making a round frame of bent branches and cover-
ing it with foliage Half-hidden in the undergrowth it
is big enough for two men to huddle in Tonight they feel
the most basic of urges to curl up in a ball and hide

INT CAMP - NIGHT

They are safe and snug in their hideaway Hector has lit

his candle He is reading his letters holding them close
to his eyes in the dimness He has the air of someone
putting his affairs in order Bobby is thinking aloud

BOBBY
Maybe hes lost too on his
own must be Delaware they

were chased up here years ago
everybody thought theyd cleared

off west the other side of
Ohio they were an angry lot
no wonder they used to farm on

the coast
He looks up at Hector and allows himself a small smile
BOBBY
Go on read it out
Hector looks up
HECTOR
What No not tonight
BOBBY
Ive had to listen to it every
night since April why not now

Hector gives in He holds a scrap of paper close to the
candle and reads
HECTOR
Dear Father I miss you Three
frogs are dead Everybody misses
you Bring me a bears head and
claws and a gun School is good
Miss White has married a fireman
Come back soon Do not worry
about the frogs they did not
have names Nathaniel

Hector looks up at Bobby

HECTOR
Its not so funny now as it was

141

BOBBY
It wasnt funny then

HECTOR
If you knew him if you could
picture him saying it it would
be funnier

BOBBY
I had a father like you nine
months on a whaler and then three
weeks at home telling us all how
much he missed us

HECTOR
Im going home for the winter

Bobby doesnt pursue his argument He tenses then
sniffs the air vigorously
BOBBY
Smell it
HECTOR
No
BOBBY
Goddam it smell it
Hector sniffs some more
HECTOR
Tobacco
They whisper
BOBBY
Where the hell is it coming
from

He puts his head out of the shelter

BOBBY
I cant tell a night like this
it could carry for miles

He huddles back inside the shelter
BOBBY
I wish I had a smoke

141 After a tense silence Hector takes a small package from
an inside pocket He hands it to Bobby

HECTOR
I was saving it you have it

It is a wedge of tobacco Bobby takes it
BOBBY
What do you mean you were saving

it You know the rules no
hoarding tobacco or food youve
listened to me for a month day and
night wanting a smoke

HECTOR
Well have it now I dont smoke
take it

BOBBY

Youve kept it from me and you
dont even use it
HECTOR
I was saving it for my birthday
I was going to give it to you then
BOBBY
I have to wait until your birthday
for a smoke Who are you the
fucking king
HECTOR
Go on smoke it have it now
BOBBY
I bloody wont Im not smoking
on your command I bloody wont
There is a brooding silence

BOBBY
God your poor children what do
they have to do for a piece of
candy in your house Its very
hard to like you sometimes dyou
know that

HECTOR

I know Bobby but thats how I

feel about you too thats why

were friends we try hard

come on smoke your pipe

141 Hector is neatly turning the tables on Bobby who now
appears churlish childish

BOBBY
No Ill have it in the morning

HECTOR

Come on

Bobby does and then breaks into a smile

Daniel B

Hector smiles too

Yeah He would be a help but

after Daniel Boone
BOBBY
I cant think of anyone else but

youre impossible to like sometimes

hink

BOBBY
oone

HECTOR

tell me who would
you rather be sitting here with

Suddenly Bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy

We should sleep Weve got a lot
of running to do in the morning

But Hector has other
friendship now

No were

talk
Bobby yields to this
smile we have yet see

So where do you want to start

BOBBY

plans He is in control of their
HECTOR
not were going to
all night

with the softest most vulnerable

non his face

HECTOR

Bobby is silent but still smiles his acquiescent smile

Hector reads the sile

I know where you want to start

nce well
HECTOR

Bobby is still silent

HECTOR

Alicia Bobbys smile breaks

Well

Im sorr

into a boyish laugh

BOBBY
what about Alicia
HECTOR

Yous

BOBBY

No Im sorry

HECTOR
What do you mean youre sorry
Im the one that has to apologize

Bobby is mischievous now

BOBBY
Oh no youre not
It will be a worthwhile night for both of them

142 EXT FOREST - DAWN 142
It is a glorious dawn Bobby sits looking out on the
valley smoking his pipe Behind him Hector is busy
writing in his log book

BOBBY
Isnt it a beautiful day
Hector finishes his writing tears out the page from his
book He offers it to Bobby
HECTOR
Ive said who we are and where
were headed Want to sign it
write anything
BOBBY
No
HECTOR
The peak we logged yesterday
Ive named it Nathanial Mountain

After my boy is that fine with
you
BOBBY
I was going to call it Tobacco
Mountain or Mount Alicia but
Nathaniels fine

142 142

Hector smiles He puts the paper in a small leather
pouch puts the pouch on the ground near the shelter
and starts to build a small pile of protective stones
on top of it

Bobby stands and turns to watch him

BOBBY
Lets get away from here
HECTOR

North
BOBBY
Yeah Keep the sun on our backs

Bobby walks off with great clouds of tobacco smoke
billowing defiantly around him as if to challenge

their night-time tormentor

Hector takes a last look at their shelter and its little
memorial cairn and then runs to catch up with Bobby

EXT FOREST - DAY 143
Hector and Bobby look vulnerable as they walk through
the open forest with their meager packs on their backs

BOBBY
We can move quicker without the
horse we just have to keep
moving we have to get away from

here
Behind them they dont see the figure moving from the
cover of one tree to another and then another figure
following the first They move like ghosts

EXT FOREST - DAY 144

Bobby is a few steps ahead of Hector He dips down
over a rise and instantly returns He throws himself
and Hector to the ground Hector tries to struggle free

HECTOR
Whats wrong
BOBBY
Quiet Theyre on the other side

Hector ducks lower hugging the ground Bobby is
already sliding up the slope to look over the rise
Hector follows him

On the other side they see the women and children of
a small group of Indians at the edge of a stream The
women are washing clothes the children are splashing and
playing We are close enough to hear their laughter
BOBBY
Were right in the middle of them

HECTOR

Does it have to be bad They might
be friendly

BOBBY
They were chased here They should
be on the coast growing corn

Bobby turns to Hector to make his point That is when he
sees the first of the figures just the ghost of a shadow
moving from tree to rock His eyes flick across the
forest behind them He sees another figure caught in

the act of seeking cover looking absurdly embarrassed
for the fleeting moment that we see it Then Bobby

sees another Are they teasing them It looks so much
like a game children would play

BOBBY
Oh-oh
HECTOR
Whats wrong
BOBBY

Theyre behind us They must
think were stalking the women
Hector looks and sees nothing Fifty Indians hold their
breath The forest seems empty But Hector looks at
Bobby He is grey-faced a man who is looking at death
Hector knows they are doomed
BOBBY
Do you want to run
HECTOR
Ill do what you do

They leap to their feet and run There is only one
way to go over the rise through the women and children
and across the stream To the watching Indians it looks
like a direct attack on their families From behind
trees and rocks they emerge and begin the chase A
tragedy of misunderstanding Hector and Bobby scatter the women and children and
splash across the stream burning all their energy in

this mad life-or-death race Although their families
are safe the Indians keep up the chase the moment of
confusion compounded in action They lope easily after

them waiting for the white men to tire There are no

whoops or shouts They follow Hector and Bobby into the
trees spreading out on either side shaping the human
net that will soon engulf them

It is a menacing spectacle Death is near Hector
and Bobby stay close together as they run
BOBBY
When they catch up fight
itll be quicker fight like
hell
HECTOR

Theyre not going to catch us
Were going home
Hector stretches out an arm to Bobby

HECTOR
Hold my hand Bobby
They hold hands and run

EXT BUILDING - DAY

A war party of media people surround Hector as he exits
a Yellow Cab He forces his way through the yelling
crowd of REPORTERS and camera crews Hector is trying
to make his way into a crumbling apartment building in

hole held only by its plumbing Firemen are working to
secure it and what is left of the floor with metal props

and hydrauli

c jacks Lying on the floor below

surrounded by rubble and being attended by the

paramedics

is an old lady MRS PHILIPPOPOLIS

She

tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over
the rim of the hole She looks angry

Hector says

MR PHILIPPOPOLIS

HECTOR

DETECTIVE

As if in response Mrs Philippopolis shouts up to
Hector as she sees him leaving the bathroom above her

MRS PHILIPPOPOLIS

He finishes the call just as Santiago approaches
his notebook now full of incriminating notes

Santiago is talking almost to himself now

SANTIAGO

floor You have any plumbing

HECTOR
At the office I might have some
bills its not my building

mundane mechanics of Hectors building

SANTIAGO

HECTOR

SANTIAGO

Hector is already dialing another number as Santiago
wanders off in search of further fascinating discoveries

HECTOR

Estate

HECTOR

During the call Hector has walked down the hall and back
to the hole in the floor He sees Mrs Philippopolis
now strapped in a stretcher being carried out of the
room below At the sight of him she tries to sit up
straining on her straps

MRS PHILIPPOPOLIS
My sons downstairs when he
sees me like this hell kill you

legs

Hector is almost tempted to do what she says
149 INT BUILDING - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY 149

All the while Mrs Philippopolis issues a non-stop

torrent of Greek expletives -- calmly and in a considered

tone but obviously obscene Hector is shocked

150 EXT BUILDING - DAY

On a street Hector stands with a Policeman watching

Mrs Philippopolis being loaded into the ambulance Her
SON is with her When she is safely inside he walks
towards Hector Fortunately he is of modest build and
a head shorter than Hector and he seems to be saving
his wrath for the Courthouse

Then Hectors girl friend ANNA arrives in her car It is

a bright pink station wagon highly decorated with flower
motifs and slogans like ANNAS ARRANGEMENTS and FRESH
OR DRY WELL PLEASE THE EYE Anna is a florist
Hector brightens when he sees her Everything is falling
into place All he has to do now is cross two rivers
and Manhatan Island in under an hour in Annas pink car
He runs to meet her
ANNA

Hector gets into the car smiling broadly

INT CAR - DAY
Anna drives skilfully through the busy Friday streets

HECTOR

Anna pulls into the curb Hector leans over to embrace
her before she has stopped the car
HECTOR

Thanks for the car

ANNA

Hector and one more thing

She indicates a massive bouquet of flowers wrapped in
cellophane taking up the whole of the luggage space in
the car

HECTOR

blocks before the bridge a
five minute detour Its a
golden wedding you have to
She looks him straight in the eye

ANNA

Hector accepts this

ANNA
Oh youll need gas too Go to
it Hector

She kisses him quickly but lovingly ANNA
Phone if theres any disasters
dont suffer alone
Hector watches Anna stride in her business-like way
around the corner OUT OF SIGHT He is almost home

INTEXT CAR - DAY

A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five oclock on

a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence
whatever you do with it and thats fine

Hectors trip to his children has more meaning for us
than a simple journey from A to B We will be aware of
our other Hectors and the journeys home that they did

or didnt manage to make This car trip will pull the
threads together

And after so many images of the natural world a world

little altered by man the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in
all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen-
sion If there is a breathtaking moment in this film
when everything comes together when all the pieces fit
then it will be somewhere around here that it happens
Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach aching
for his family If the traffic allows tonight in New
Jersey Hector will complete his journey

We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge ACROSS the
avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel His PHONE
RINGS ONCE

HECTOR

Hello Leonard hello yes

were insured thank God yes

now I know Gods a lawyer

thanks
On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban
street he is looking for If the last crosslight holds
on green then he might even make it on time
Hector stops the car outside Janets house and lets out
a sigh of relief

154 EXT HOUSE - EVENING 154

Hectors former wife JANET and her new husband DONALD
come out of the house as Hector walks up to the door
Donald is carrying luggage and heads straight for their
car in the driveway

154

DONALD

Hi Hector
He starts loading up the car Janet talks to Hector
JANET

You made it The kids are just
coming Theyre not over the
moon about going to the beach
house I ought to warn you

HECTOR
Why didnt you say I could have
fixed up something else I
thought it would be a good place
to get to know them again

JANET
Well I figured you should be

allowed to make your own mistakes
Its only for a couple of nights

they can take it and youll
learn Check into a hotel if
it gets too much they like
hotels
She shouts into the house
JANET
Come on you two your fathers

ready to go
She hands Hector a piece of paper

JANET
This is where well be if
anything crops up thanks for

the break

Hector gets a little scared about what he has taken on

HECTOR
Maybe this is a bit sudden for
them Maybe I should have come

over a couple of nights and got
to know them

Janet doesnt let him off the hook
JANET
By Monday youll know them

Then the children come out of the house BETSY
about thirteen and TOM who is eleven JANET
Here he is the invisible dad

She turns to Hector
JANET
Thats what they call you

Hector is daunted by how grown up they are not

who is

any

more the little kids in the photograph in his wallet

HECTOR

Hi
They hardly lift their heads to him

BETSY
Hi
TOM
Hi
Janet takes control of the farewells

JANET

You three have a good weekend

If its too miserable at the

house your father said hell

Hector nods his head obediently He always did with
Janet The children let their mother pat them and follow
Hector to his car eyes to the ground

JANET
Good luck Hector

Donald shouts from behind the wheel of his car where he
has been hiding
DONALD
See you Monday Hector
The kids load themselves into the back of Hectors car

Betsy notices the huge arrangement of flowers wrapped
in cellophane and red ribbon It seems to have grown
even larger than before
BETSY
Are those for mom

Hector looks at the flowers His face contorts in guilt

and anxiety

( ) HECTOR
Oh no Jesus save me what
have I done
BETSY

Whats wrong

He picks up his mobile phone and is about to dial Annas
number then he stops
HECTOR
No I cant face it not just

now
He looks at the kids

HECTOR
Lets go

155 INTEXT CAR - DUSK 155
They are driving on the freeway It is dusk Hector is
on the telephone again He cant let go of business
HECTOR

He gets connected

HECTOR
Hello God No Leonard its
Hector just a joke sorry to

Betsy and Tom are listening in the back seat eager for
clues about this virtual stranger in front of them

HECTOR
Is there anything we can do right

with the insurance company sure
youre right me too I have
the kids in the car with me right

( )

155

Hector throws the phone onto the passenger seat lets out
a sigh and catches sight of the kids in the mirror
Their perplexed expressions make them look younger than
they are and vulnerable Hectors heart aches for them
He smiles and puts on an act of brightness

HECTOR
Thats it The last call the
weekend starts right now we
have things to do look out for
a Safeway we need some
supplies and gas oh my God

gas Soon

They return his look with blank expressions He picks up
the phone and offers it to them

She shakes her head

HECTOR

Want to make any calls Betsy
HECTOR

Tom

TOM

HECTOR
But we called you Tom thats
what it says on your birth
certificate

THOMAS (TOM)

Hector wisely lets it go

HECTOR
Right its your name you

eyes skinned and I could murder

a Chicken McNugget

INT SAFEWAY - NIGHT

Hector is pushing a cart around a large Safeway The
place is almost deserted Betsy and Thomas are tagging

along

For every four items Hector puts in his cart Betsy

removes
notices
returns
makes a

three and returns them to the shelf Hector
and puts up with it for a while But when Betsy
the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he

stand He turns to face her
HECTOR
Whats wrong with that Its a
kitchen roll why cant I pick

a kitchen roll

Betsy is defiant

BETSY
Its bleached and it isnt
recycled you dont care

She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from
the shelf and throws it into the cart Hector has the
sense to back down
HECTOR
Good point Betsy
Betsy keeps on the attack
BETSY
Everything you buy is junk I
dont eat steak and whats
this
She prods a packet of frozen hamburgers

BETSY
Ugh Why dont you ask us what

A trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice
Hector warms to her

HECTOR
Youre right

Hector pushes the cart to her

HECTOR
Well get to it Ill just tag
along

Betsy moves off with the cart
BETSY
I do it every week anyway 156
Thomas backs her up

THOMAS

HECTOR

steaks We cant live on chicken

EXT GAS STATION - NIGHT

Hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to
the Safeway An attractive woman is filling her car in
the next line Her eyes and Hectors meet For some
reason they exchange the smallest smile For a few

brief moments they are talking without words as their
tanks fill The ten billionth romance in the history of
the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the
twinkling of an eye By the time their credit cards are
back in their pockets their love is a memory From the
back of the car the kids have watched it all

Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he
climbs back into the car

INTEXT CAR - NIGHT

Back on the road it is later The kids have fallen
asleep Hector relaxes He watches them in their sleep
searching for some traces of the little children that
have haunted his thoughts for so many years the tots
he abandoned

EXT HOLIDAY HOUSE - NIGHT

The car pulls up at the holiday house Hector gets out
It is dark but we can hear the sound of the SEA and
there is sand underfoot Hector walks to the house and
unlocks the door He puts on a couple of exterior lights
He carries Thomas still sleeping from the car and into
the house Betsy follows him still half-asleep groaning
fussily She talks through her yawns

BETSY
Are you going to bring the flowers
in

HECTOR

Dont mention the flowers

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

Later Hector cant sleep It has been too eventful a
day He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW
A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking
to a phone-in viewer The TV man has five small stones
which he regularly scatters on the floor

TV MAN (VO)

This is good Tony the stones

are talking to me already now
heres something travel
movement Tony are you planning
a move travel anything

TONY (V0O)
Yes I am Ive been thinking

about a move to California

TV MAN (VO)
The big one eh Tony These
stones are really talking here

in California

TONY (V0O)

Mel

TV MAN (VO)
Tony these stones really like
what youre planning there is
no doubt in my mind about that
now listen you have to be
specific these stones really
want to tell you something be it
love money or the purpose of your

life but I want a specific
question from you think about
it what do you want to know
love or your income level next

year Be as specific as you
can Tony

Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier
Hectors but our modern one is simply restless He

stands up

and leaves the room

INT HOUSE - NIGHT
he watches the kids sleeping in their little
holiday beds Hector watches them Weve seen our

Hectors do this before and we feel the echo
he turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright

Next door

But as

Betsy starts talking loudly At first Hector thinks she
giving him into trouble but she is fast asleep

is awake

BETSY

Get me the books all the books
all of the books no no no
not the pancakes not the
pancakes no

She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a
tearful crumpled little girl She sobs pitifully

BETSY
not the pancakes

Hector is a confusion of feelings frightened
fascinated impotent How can he help her How could he
possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes what comfort
could he offer his stranger daughter if he did It is
a spooky mystical moment for Hector more mystical than
the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door
TV WOMAN (VO)
find your true cosmic partner

first time around every weekday

morning at three here on the Psychic

Network Lucindas Horoscope Dating

Show remember there is an answer

and there is a special partner out

there for you
Hector moves quietly out of the room Betsys sobs having
subsided Just as he is closing the door he gets
another surprise this time from the sleeping Thomas

THOMAS
dont let the oil run out
yes you did watch the oil
why why
Hector closes the bedroom door He is one spooked moved

human being

162 INT HOUSE - MORNING

In the morning they are making breakfast in the kitchen
The kids are having juice and cereal Hector is
scrambling some eggs
HECTOR
How about some eggs
They shake their heads

162 162
HECTOR
You dont eat eggs

BETSY
How many have you got in there

HECTOR
Three Is that all right
BETSY
For a week maybe

Hector does a little probing
HECTOR
How about pancakes Betsy dyou
like pancakes
BETSY
Not much why
HECTOR
I just wondered Pancakes dont
mean much to you
BETSY
They dont mean a thing Why
HECTOR
Nothing
The mystery of Betsys pancake dream is evidently lost in
infinity Hector changes the subject

HECTOR
I thought we could walk into town
this morning I saw the Funfair
when we came through last night
THOMAS
We dont go to Funfairs

HECTOR
Lets take the walk anyway

THOMAS
I brought some books I want to
stay home and read
Hector is determined to make it work

HECTOR
No Were taking a walk

163 INT HALLWAY - DAY 163
They are preparing to leave the house Thomas is still

reluctant to go

THOMAS

Its going to rain we should
stay

HECTOR
Heres an umbrella and there
must be some old coats in here
and shoes I only have these
Im wearing

THOMAS
Donald has some shoes

Thomas is already in the cupboard under the stairs He
emerges with a pair of sturdy walking shoes
HECTOR

I dont know if I want to wear
Donalds shoes
THOMAS
Why not
Hector declines to explain the complex reasons that he
might have for not wanting to wear the shoes of his

childrens replacement father He sits down on the
stairs to put them on Then something on the wall
catches his eye
HECTOR
Wow Look at this

The kids heights have been marked on the wall on some
long-ago holiday The dates are beside them

HECTOR
Six years ago Look at that
Whats this

He points to a mark and a date lower down on the wall
THOMAS
That was the flood The sea came
right up Donald says its the
icecap melting Its going to get
worse Thats why Moms selling
the place

HECTOR
It comes up every year

BETSY
The last two

EXT BEACH - DAY

They are on the beach walking in the direction of town
Hector strides ahead in a show of enthusiasm although
awkward in Donalds big shoes The kids trail behind

He calls back to them

HECTOR
Where are the birds Is it the
wrong time of year
BETSY
They dont come over so much
The shellfish have gone thats
what
HECTOR
Thats what Donald says
BETSY
Yes and it happens to be true
Hector looks at the sky He speaks quietly to himself
HECTOR
Please dont rain please

EXT FUNFAIR - DAY

The light DRIZZLE now falling is keeping away what few

fun-seekers there are left in town The Funfair is not
much fun It is the end of the season Hector and the

ids are a sorry sight parading the empty alleys The
ids seem to glory in the misery of it all getting back
at Hector for four years of neglect Heavy-hearted
Hector still tries to make a go of it

HECTOR
Lets have a ride
He has stopped at some dated space rockets

BETSY
The seats are wet
Hector triumphs He pulls a wad of kitchen roll from
his pocket and starts to wipe the seats

HECTOR
Kitchen roll unbleached
re-cycled biodegradable dry
seats
Betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb
aboard the rockets

As the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up
into the drizzle ‘round and round Hector knows that he
has to do something to break the awful distance between
him and his kids He looks at them They sit grimly in
their rockets one in front of him and one behind Their
faces are set in expressions of what Boredom
Resignation Patience Expectancy Then he realizes
what is going on They are waiting for him to open up to
them talk to them seriously explain himself He looks
at Betsys face and sees in it the years of his absence
her stoicism her patience her courage It moves him
He leans over to her
HECTOR

This is ridiculous Lets go

somewhere and talk
Betsy smiles her small patient smile

BETSY

All right if you want to
Hector looks to Thomas Thomas vigorously nods his
agreement Hector is happier He looks down on the
decrepit fairground

HECTOR

How do we land these things

INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The only place the small town has to offer is a deserted
coffee shop on the shorefront Hector Betsy and Thomas
sit at a corner table beyond them through the window is
the beach and the ocean

HECTOR
Sure you wont have a pancake

Betsy

Betsy gets impatient

BETSY
No

The kids are

HECTOR
Okay first question

ready for this There is no coyness now
THOMAS
Where have you been

BETSY
What he means is why did you stay
away

Hector begins like a story-teller embarking on a long

saga

HECTOR
Well thats a fair question
your mother and I got divorced
youre big enough to remember
she must have told you all that

BETSY
Sure she has but lots of people
get divorced that doesnt mean
they disappear

HECTOR
Youre right what can I tell
you I went kind of crazy after
that for a good while I came
around a few times remember

THOMAS
Not really

HECTOR
Well it wasnt easy everything

with her and Donald happened
pretty quickly I missed you both
really badly but for a while I
thought I should stay away until
your mother got settled no
thats not really true I missed
you but I was kind of crazy at
the same time your mother and I
married young I wasnt used to
the freedom it went to my head
then you moved to New Jersey

166 BETSY
Its forty minutes away on a slow
bus
HECTOR

Youre right youre right I
dont have too many excuses for
the first year the second year
is easier I was in jail
Hector is pleased with this A solid excuse

THOMAS
What for

HECTOR
We were doing government work
big contracts there were some
temptations my boss asked me
to shuffle a few papers there
was a lot of money in it I had
to testify against him it was
like killing somebody

Hector thinks about this remembering the pain For us
there is the echo of the real killing that was done long
ago
BETSY
Thomas wanted to visit you in
jail but Mom wouldnt let him

Hector looks at Thomas

HECTOR
You did
Thomas nods proudly
HECTOR
Well I appreciate that but Im

glad your mother didnt let you
Ill tell you all about it some
day It was no fun One year
and eight months

THOMAS
We didnt even know when you got
out

HECTOR
I wasnt in great shape I sure
didnt want you to see me then
so I got back to work in real
estate found a partner we met

in jail

The kids look shocked at this

Betsy shrugs

HECTOR
No Hes a good man a good man
I like him I mean it Hes my
friend

BETSY
Thats what you do now

HECTOR
Yes We rent apartments but
we want to get into commercial
property people are a
nuisance does that sound bad
her shoulders

BETSY

How should I know

Hector carries on with his story

HECTOR
Just recently Ive been feeling
good things have been going
well and I missed you two
so here we are
BETSY
What about your girl friend
HECTOR
Who told you about her

BETSY
Nobody
HECTOR
Anna shes nice she wants to
meet you real soon she sells
flowers well you know that

and on Monday shes probably going
to kill me

The kids smile

166 THOMAS
Betsy thinks that was her at the
gas station
BETSY
Shut up Tom

Hector has to think to remember

HECTOR
No heck no did you think
she was following us
THOMAS
Shes always thinking up stories
like that she never stops
BETSY
Well if people dont tell you
things
HECTOR
Shes right Thomas people
should talk more
THOMAS

So you havent been staying away
because of us

HECTOR
What do you mean Is that what
you thought I was avoiding you
two No you mustnt think
that thats terrible
They have almost exhausted themselves in this first bout
of talking Hector looks out at the sea

HECTOR
The rains off Lets go

167 EXT BEACH - DAY

Betsy and Hector are sitting on the sea wall watching
Thomas play on the beach The sun is emerging

BETSY
I have to ask you something else
HECTOR
Go on

167

BETSY
Why did you leave just two days
before my swimming test
Hector is moved by the depth of her memory her pain

HECTOR
I didnt leave because it was two
days before your test it was
just what your mother and I
decided I taught you how to
swim we went to the pool twice
a week why would I leave
BETSY
I know thats what I mean

why did you leave just then
Hector looks at Betsy She is beginning to cry silently
He puts a tentative arm around her shoulder
HECTOR
Oh God Betsy Im sorry

Betsy is still crying
BETSY
It doesnt matter

HECTOR
How did you do in the test
BETSY
I passed
Hector leaves his limp arm on her shoulder It is too

soon for gestures of emotion After a long moment she
speaks
BETSY

Im a life-saver now

Hector doesnt make the obvious comment His emotions
are full He hides his feelings in a gruff call to

Thomas
HECTOR
Hey Thomas Were going home
were having a barbecue Betsy

said shell even let me eat a

steak

BETSY
Hurry up Tom
( ) 167
Thomas breaks off from his play and runs towards them
HECTOR
Dont call him Tom he doesnt
like it
BETSY

Im allowed
Somehow Hector is touched by this

HECTOR
Your mother said it when we
split up dont lose the
children didnt mean much at

the time But she was right

BETSY
Who said Id let you eat a steak
There is a silence Then Hector speaks
HECTOR
Betsy On Monday will you come

with me when I take the flowers
back to Anna I cant face her

alone She wants to meet you
anyway
BETSY
Sure
HECTOR
Youll be there right beside me
BETSY
Id have to take the morning off
school
HECTOR

Is that bad

BETSY
No that could be good

Betsy and Hector are quite close now
HECTOR
Just tell them you were with your
invisible dad

168 EXT BEACH - DAY 168
Hector and Betsy are walking on the shore Thomas tags
along behind them

BETSY
Whats she like How did you
meet her

HECTOR
The funny thing is I fell in love
with her before I ever saw her
I smelled her It was the day I
got out of jail I was on the
train and she was sitting behind
me it was just this incredible
perfume remember Id been
inside for nearly two years with
four hundred sweating males
She got off the train and I
followed her I couldnt help
it thats how good she is
she listened to a bum who followed
her off a train
Betsy looks at him kindly
HECTOR
but shes still going to kill
me on Monday

They share a laugh Betsy looks out to the ocean
BETSY
I think Ill paint the sunset
tonight
HECTOR

Its just like a big pancake
up there isnt it
Betsy doesnt take the bait There is a silence

HECTOR
I remember when you two were tiny
I used to watch you sleeping it
was like now I felt close to you
could touch you but you werent
there you were gone dreamland
just when I was closest to you

you werent there I felt it last
night too

BETSY
Thats what its like you
should know that

HECTOR
Im not smart about things like
that usually

BETSY
Dont be so tough on yourself
You seem to want to be you
dont have to

HECTOR

No

BETSY
No we can do that

She smiles Hector is out of his depth with this
daughter of his

HECTOR
Is that a joke
BETSY
No I mean it look out for

yourself
Hector looks at her in wonderment One of those moments
when another human being stands before you and is an
utter mystery

HECTOR
Who are you Whos inside
there

BETSY

Youll never know
Future generations of women are going to be just as
unknowable to our Hectors as past ones were Betsy
moves off briskly along the beach Hector trails
after her hooked

EXT BOAT - DAY
Betsy and Thomas are in a small fragile rowboat some
distance from the shore They are watching Hector who

is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach
Another Hector and another pile of stones This one

is making a fire for the barbecue These human rituals
never stop

BETSY

I thought he was taller
( )

THOMAS
Well its been a while youre
bigger

BETSY

I suppose so Hes getting fat
too I bet I could beat him at
the breast-stroke now

EXT BEACH - DAY

Hector turns from his work Out at sea the kids look
small and vulnerable Hector is more anxious than he
should be out of practice at fatherhood He calls to
them

HECTOR
Come on in kids that boat
doesnt look too safe
They call back to him
BETSY
Were fine
Hector tries to relax but he doesnt have the
confidence yet or something He is edgy

HECTOR
Ive just found you I dont
want to lose you What would I
tell your mother come on in

He walks down to the water The kids reluctantly pull
on the oars and bring the little boat in A few feet
from the beach they hit some sand The boat sticks
Hector wades out in his shoes so far Then he calls
to Thomas
HECTOR

Throw me the rope Thomas Ill

pull you in
Thomas throws the mooring rope to Hector It isnt

attached to the boat Hector ends up with all of the
rope in his hands He stands there and they all laugh
HECTOR
This is one useless piece of
rope Thomas

Just for a moment we have the image of our Hector
standing on the shoreline with a length of rope An
image with an echo from six thousand years ago But
this time Hector is laughing and his kids are safe

EXT BEACH - SUNSET

At the very moment of sunset Betsy is trying to capture
it in a watercolor sketch She has set up an easel on
the beach Its like action painting She works
frantically on the picture racing the sun as it dips
into the ocean Tough little Betsy can even lose
patience with the sun

BETSY
Why does it always go so fast
Thomas is laughing at her He has seen her attempt this
before Hector has other concerns He is trying to
light his barbecue Match after match disappears into

his elaborate stone structure only to fizzle out

The sun finally vanishes and Betsy goes limp at her
easel The sun has won the race again She and Thomas
watch Hector trying to light the fire After a while
he is conscious of their amused attention on him then
he becomes a little self-conscious
HECTOR
I used to know how to do this

They laugh a little
HECTOR
I did I used to be really
good at this
He wafts and blows ineffectually at a flicker of flame
Theres not much of the caveman about him now

EXT BEACH - DUSK
It is a calm dusk Hector is turning the meat on the
barbecue He is in a splendid frame of mind

HECTOR
Ah smell it the smell of
civilization scorched meat

Hector serves the chicken onto their plates He sits

down beside them with his steak and a glass of wine
He watches Thomas attack his chicken and smiles

HECTOR
Id forgotten that how you
eat dedicated like its
your religion

THOMAS
Things I like

HECTOR
You used to hum to yourself too
when you ate like everything
was fine with the world
Thomas tries it out eating and humming It feels good
to him His head nods with the chewing and the tune

THOMAS
Hey so I did Id forgotten
about that

The early stars are appearing in the sky Hector lifts
his eyes to a bright point low on the horizon

HECTOR
There she is old Mercury
THOMAS
No Mercury doesnt rise til
after midnight thats Jupiter
Hector is impressed by his son

HECTOR
Id forgotten we used to watch

the stars you could tell me the
names of all the planets you

could recite them like a poem

remember at the tiny window
upstairs in the old house
THOMAS
No
HECTOR

Oh well not to worry Im glad

you still like astronomy though
THOMAS
Im not into star-gazing so much
were working on computer
modelling were trying to make
a biosphere

HECTOR

Uh-huh
THOMAS
A self-sustaining life system
for inter-stellar travel But we
always get a methane build up it
doesnt matter what we do

HECTOR
This is at school

THOMAS
Yeah Were making such a mess of
the world one day were going to
have to take off for somewhere
else

HECTOR
Sounds like Donald said that

Hector realizes how far his kids have travelled from

him He looks at them

Betsy chimes

HECTOR
Well Im glad you two are thinking
about the old planet Im proud
of you Look how beautiful
everything is Sometimes I thin
its people that make it all
wrong we walk around with all
our problems

in
BETSY

I dont know If it wasnt for
us thered be nobody around to
see it all

Hector stands to fetch another baked potato from the fire
We see the three of them in a WIDE SHOT the evening sky
now pulsing with more and more points of light Hectors
voice and laughter carry to us

HECTOR

Dont worry you two Ill tell

you its just a big black

sheet up there with holes in it

so the light comes through

thats the truth the very

latest
Hector has come to rest and found peace at last however
temporary here on the beach beneath the same stars that
our first Hector wailed at six thousand years ago
On Monday he will face the music The kids will go
back home Mrs Philippopolis will have to be dealt with
and the wilting three hundred dollar bouquet of flowers
In general life will take over on Monday But at this
moment of calm on the beach lets leave him while hes
ahead Their voices ring out playfully across the expanse of
darkening beach and light-laden sky

BETSY

ait a minute I know the
hole universe is inside a speck
f dust thats lying in a ball of
luff in the cuff of a pair of
ants hanging over the back of a
hair

QThHhOoOzS

HECTOR

No Ill tell you the whole
thing stars and everything
is sitting on the skin of a bubble
of milk in a bowl of cornflakes
and somebodys just about to eat

it
The three of them are laughing now
BETSY
Skimmed milk
THOMAS
You dont get bubbles in skimmed
milk
HECTOR
Okay its half-and-half

Perhaps thats just about as close as Hector and his

tribe of humans will ever come to working it all out
But they try

BETSY
Ive got a better one were
all inside a speck of pollen
thats stuck to the wing of a bee
while it sits on a flower

HECTOR
Dont mention flowers Betsy

please not tonight

And then after a long long pause

HECTOR
I have an idea Betsy were
inside a pancake what dyou
think 172

BETSY
Why are you always talking about
pancakes whats wrong with you

THOMAS
Youve got pancakes on the brain

FADE OUT

THE END
