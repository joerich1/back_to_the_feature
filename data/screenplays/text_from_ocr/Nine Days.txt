INT WILL’S HOUSELIVING ROOM - DAY AA
CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

It shows - COLOR BARS

A continuous COLOR BARS TONE

Suddenly the screen turns WHITE

IN THE TV the POV of a NEWBORN A blurry image of her
PARENTS smiling at her

INT WILL’S LIVING ROOM - DAY Al
MONTAGE shows the POV of this baby growing up

A VIOLIN SONG starts

Now at 1 year old the baby crawls through the house

At 3 years old the little girl plays with a TOY VIOLIN

QP

t 5 years old she dances in the rain jumping in the
uddles

t 7 years old the girl plays the violin this time a real
ne Her teacher is by her side

OP

t 9 she’s at school A crayon in her hand she draws with
er CLASSMATES

t 12 the girl beautifully plays the violin - a prodigy
t 15 she blows the candles out on her birthday cake
t 17 she plays the violin in an orchestra

t 21 it’s her graduation She and her classmates throw
heir caps up into the air

tr Pp Pp PP YP

At 23 she is the soloist of an orchestra

At 27 in the airplane she lifts up the window shade to see
the sunset She looks at her reflection in the window glass -
delicate traits and thoughtful eyes This is AMANDA

Finally at 28 she rehearses with a bigger orchestra They
play the SONG we were listening to during the MONTAGE Amanda
plays the solo with the virtuosity of someone who dedicated
her life to the craft The other MUSICIANS can do nothing but
admire her performance
WHITE 2

At this point we discover that the TV is in a LIVING ROOM A
MAN watches it from his couch A VCR records the TV

The man has an impassive look with eyes that have seen more
than they wanted to see You would say that he’s in his
forties but he’s much older than that Meet WILL

CLOSE on his eyes fixed on the screen like a caring father
who watches over his child

ON THE TV Amanda’s solo gradually slows down One last note
is played which echoes through the rehearsal room

The silence is broken by an applause from her peers

Will stops recording it and ejects the tape Then grabs a
sheet of paper

ON THE TV we hear the DANISH CONDUCTOR give the last
instructions to the musicians

CONDUCTOR

Good job everyone See you all at 5
tomorrow Eat well rest well fuck
well

(musicians laugh)
And if you have any problems
don’t let me know

(more laughs)

Will writes on the sheet of paper “Amanda Grazzini 10327
days since selection Last rehearsal before concerto Sublime
performance” (A beautiful handwriting)

ON THE TV Amanda packs her violin She passes by the
conductor

CONDUCTOR (CONTD)
Amanda

She stops

CONDUCTOR (CONTD)
That was really good

AMANDA
Thanks

Will watches her leaving the building Then he grabs the
notes and the VHS tape and heads to --
WHITE 3

INT FILE CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS 1

Dozens and dozens of FILE CABINETS Each one with a name on
it Will opens a cabinet named “AMANDA”

INSIDE THE CABINET several VHS tapes and folders with
handwritten notes from the last years maybe decades
Everything neatly organized

Will places his recent notes and the VHS tape inside the
cabinet and closes it

INT LIVING ROOM —- CONTINUOUS 2

When Will comes back to the living room a WIDER SHOT reveals
Many more TVs hanging on the wall - thirty of them Each one
broadcasts the POV of a different person and each TV has a
name written on it Amanda Rick Fernando Luiza etc

MONTAGE Will checks the other TVs He also takes notes and
records some of the moments on VHS tapes

ON A TV a kid is bullied by his classmates at school They
throw his backpack to each other while he tries to get it
back

Will writes on a paper as he watches the screen “Rick
Virgil 5122 days since selection Bullying continues
Increasing introspection”

ON ANOTHER TV a woman works in a factory She folds paper
boxes and puts brownies inside them She repeats it over and
over again

Will writes on paper “Michelle Johnson 7789 days since
selection No significantrelevant new event”

ON ANOTHER TV in a dance studio a woman practices some
ballroom moves with her partner

Will writes down “Luiza Ceolin 10291 days since selection
Last dance class before wedding”

ON ANOTHER TV a man cocks his pistol at a SHOOTING RANGE
Despite the distance he hits the bullseye several times As
the man finishes his training and heads to the exit we
realize that he’s in a WHEELCHAIR

Will writes down “Fernando Pereira 9679 days since
selection Shooting Range practice Slow but noticeable
recovery”
WHITE 4

INTERCUT Will puts the handwritten notes and the VHS tapes
into their respective cabinets in the CABINET ROOM

As the montage goes on Will notices the sun setting in the
TVs He sees people in their end of the day activities
coming home getting back from work having dinner

It starts to get dark in Will’s house as well
On the TVs as people prepare to sleep we see their last

arrangements - taking a shower brushing their teeth going
to bed

Soon all the TVs go BLACK - people close their eyes to
sleep Some of the screens go BLACK other broadcast
blurrycolorful images representing the DREAMS of people

EXCEPT ONE AMANDA’S TV She is still awake and plays her
violin at a rehearsal studio Will comes close to her TV
Amanda finishes the song and walks through the studio No one
else is there Amanda enters the bathroom and washes her
face She stares at herself in the mirror It’s still a POV
but the mirror makes it possible for Will to see her face
For a moment it feels like they are looking at each other

OMITTED 3

INT GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 4
No vehicles here
Pieces of wood and metal on the floor

On a desk hammers screwdrivers drills a handsaw a
mallet smoothing planes jigsaws

Will works on fixing a HOMEMADE SPOTLIGHT His skillful hands
cautiously tighten a small bulb into it Done He TURNS IT
ON A strong light sparks but suddenly

SCRASH

The bulb explodes

Will looks for other bulbs but can’t find any

EXT HOUSE - NIGHT 5
Will leaves the house and passes through the fence door

We find out that it’s a DESERT outside

WHITE 5

Will holds a BAG and a LANTERN which illuminates his path
After walking for a while he gets to --

A DUMPING GROUND

Will searches through the several objects on the ground
papers boxes wood old furniture most of the things are
in good condition He lifts an old bicycle to find some
LIGHTING BULBS below He chooses the ones he likes and puts
them into his bag He also collects some VHS TAPES

EXT DESERT - LATER 6
As Will walks back home he passes by a house - similar to
the one he lives in The LIGHTS ARE ON Through its window
we can see a MIDDLE AGED MAN watching several TVs from his
couch

He’s dressed like Will - office shirt and dark pants

Will passes by his house without saying anything

OMITTED 7

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 8
OFF SCREEN the SOUND of Will opening the door

Amanda’s TV is ON She’s awake still in bed Her eyes wide
open looking at the ceiling

She slowly breathes in and breathes out Probably middle-of-
the-night insomnia

Will comes closer He pulls a chair and sits next to the TV

He stays there as if to keep her company through the night

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY (TV INSERT) 9

POV of people waking up

OMITTED 10

WHITE 6

EXT WILL’S HOUSEBACKYARD - DAY 11

We watch from behind the fences Will harvests tea leaves
from his tiny planter

He stares at the dawn Strangely there’s NO SUN in this weird
sunset Night is gradually replaced by day as if a big light
was turning on

INT PROJECTION ROOM - DAY 12
A small room with some chairs and a VIDEO PROJECTOR on a
small desk He sweeps the floor with a broom

OMITTED 13

INT CABINET ROOM - DAY 14

He puts his notes from today into the cabinets

INT OFFICE ROOM - DAY 15

This is his work space a desk in the middle of the room
some papers on it and a few chairs around it

For the moment though he just uses the place to IRON a
SOCIAL SHIRT and SOCIAL PANTS
INT KITCHEN - DAY 16

On the stove water boils inside a TEA POT Dried tea leaves
inside it Will turns it off

Suddenly His WRIST WATCH ALARM BEEPS It’s time

OMITTED 17

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 18

He lowers the volume of the TVs except Amanda’s Then he
INSERTS the VHS tape in the VCR It reads AMANDA - CONCERTO
DAY He presses RECORD

ON AMANDA’S TV she sits on her bed and stares at the
CONCERTO FLYER
WHITE 7
ON THE FLYER only the conductor and Amanda’s pictures are
featured

She lays it on the bed then looks at the violin case resting
on the floor

She keeps staring at the violin case for a long long beat
Will is puzzled

Suddenly --

The DOORBELL in Will’s house RINGS

He walks to --

THE FRONT DOOR

Will opens it We see a tall Asian man (40s) - British accent
- wearing an elegant social shirt and social pants He holds

a grocery paper bag This is KYO

KYO
I brought you some supplies

Will studies him

WILL
Did you come here to bring supplies
or to watch the concerto

Kyo thinks

KYO
Both

As Kyo walks down the corridor Will points to the kitchen

WILL
I made some tea

KYO
Love it

Kyo heads to the KITCHEN He opens the fridge to find it
filled with rotten food Will hasn’t consumed anything again
Kyo shakes his head

KYO (CONTD)
What a waste
(finding more rotten food)
What a fucking waste

WHITE 8

Kyo throws the old food away and replaces it with the fresh
groceries from the paper bag Then he looks at the stove -
the TEAPOT is there

KYO (CONTD)
Here you are

He pours the tea into a cup and smells it with delight

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 19

Will still stares at Amanda’s TV Kyo comes in holding his
cup of tea

KYO
Anything you want me to bring

WILL
No I got all I need

KYO
Love

WILL
What

KYO

“Love is all you need”
No answer As always Will just ignores him

Kyo drinks his tea and focuses on Amanda’s TV He stares at
her playing the violin

KYO (CONTD)
Is everything ok with her

WILL
Why do you ask

KYO
I’ve never seen her practice right
before a concerto

WILL
She’s just a little nervous

Will seems a bit anxious too A moment until he heads to the
OFFICE ROOM Kyo stays and stares at the other TVs

KYO
She’s gonna be fine Why don’t you
sit
WHITE 9

WILL
I’m gonna get dressed

KYO
Be my guest

Will heads to the OFFICE ROOM Kyo stays and stares at the
other TVs

KYO (CONTD)
(to himself)
So what’s new

He does a quick analysis of people’s lives He starts
watching a man eating bacon eggs and sausages --

KYO (CONTD)
Rob keeps working on his heart
attack Kate has a new
boyfriend Armenia bought another
cat Rick’s still bullied

Meanwhile Will is at the OFFICE ROOM wearing the shirt that
he ironed

In the LIVING ROOM Kyo watches the POV of a woman staring at
her reflection in the mirror Her name is LUIZA and she’s
trying on a WEDDING DRESS
INTERCUT BETWEEN KYO AND WILL talking from DIFFERENT ROOMS
KYO (CONTD)
Will when is Luiza getting
married

No answer

KYO (CONTD)
Will

Will is putting on a tie

WILL
All information is in her cabinet
KYO
I know But when is she getting
married
Will sighs
WILL

In eight days
WHITE 10

Kyo takes his agenda out of his pocket and writes on it

KYO
Perfect Thanks for inviting me

Kyo scans through the other TVs He relaxes as if watching a
Sunday football game

Will comes back to the room wearing a shirt tie and nice
pants -- He’s ready to watch the concerto

Will sees Kyo’s feet over the COFFEE TABLE

WILL
(Can you not do that)

Kyo takes his feet off the table Will’s clearly annoyed

KYO
You may pretend you don’t like me
but I know you’re gonna cry
everyday when I’m gone

WILL
(sarcastic)
I didn’t know you’re going
anywhere

KYO
Youll see You’ll see

Suddenly A COUNTRY SONG starts playing
Will and Kyo look at the TV it comes from

It’s FERNANDO the paraplegic man who was practicing at the
shooting range Fernando raises the volume of his SPEAKERS
and gets to his bathroom Then prepares to take a shower
However because he can’t move his legs it takes him a while
to move from the wheel chair to the bath tub Through his
struggle we can see that he’s still new to this process

While Will and Kyo watch Fernando’s lasting effort
KYO (CONTD)
Looks like Fernando is doing much

better

No answer Will keeps watching Fernando’s struggle until he
finally gets into the bathtub

WHITE 11

Will still stares at Fernando TV when
Kyo points to Amanda’s TV
KYO (CONTD)
Look She’s heading to the
concerto

They look at Amanda’s TV She drives her car on a freeway

Will lowers the volume from Fernando’s TV Their eyes focus
on Amanda’s POV while she drives

KYO (CONTD)
What time does it start

WILL
At 6

KYO
So why is she driving so fast

Suddenly --

HER CAR HITS A CONCRETE WALL at a tunnel entrance

The WINDSHIELD SHATTERS --- and in a fraction of a second
- Her TV TURNS OFF

Silence

Just like that Amanda is dead

CLOSE on the VCR still in REC mode

INT CABINET ROOM - NIGHT 20
Kyo is in front of Amanda’s cabinet reading her files

It looks like he’s been there for a long time We see a pile
of folders on the floor

A dead silence

WILL sits in a chair next to the cabinets He stares into
space - no emotion on his face

KYO
And you’re sure you haven’t seen
anything different

Will doesn’t answer his mind is somewhere else
WHITE 12
KYO (CONTD)
Will
He wakes up from his deep thought

WILL
What did you say

KYO
Have you seen anything different

WILL
No
(moment )
Yes
KYO
No Yes
WILL

Some problems sleeping But she
usually had them before big
Concertos

Kyo finishes reading her files He puts everything back to
the cabinet and CLOSES it

KYO
Well Nothing we do now is gonna
change anything
Amanda was definitely a great
choice and you should be proud
of everything she achieved

Will doesn’t answer He stands up and goes to the --
20A LIVING ROOM 20A
He sits on the couch and stares at the TVs
Kyo soon sits by his side
KYO (CONTD)
I’m sorry Will She was a
wonderful wonderful person

Will stares at Amanda’s TURNED OFF TV for a moment

WILL
What if she did it on purpose

KYO
Her car hit a concrete wall She
died instantly

WHITE 13
KYO (CONTD)
Those are the only things we know
for sure Anything else would be
speculation

WILL
I didn’t see her turning the wheel

KYO
Anything else would be speculation

The silence sinks in Suddenly
AMANDA’S TV TURNS ON

ON THE TV COLOR BARS - like the moments before a
transmission starts We hear the loud COLOR BARS TONE

KYO (CONTD)
Try to get some rest Tomorrow you
have a lot of work to do

Kyo puts his hand on his shoulder then walks away

Will stays in the room staring at the COLOR BARS SCREEN

EXT DESERT - NIGHT 21
The COLOR BARS TONE echoes through outside the house - we can
hear it loud but some people can hear it even louder

EXT DESERT - DAY 22
DAY ONE

It’s already morning but the COLOR BARS TONE is still there

From a distance we see someone walking through the desert
The TONE gets louder as we approach the person

We are in this person’s PERSPECTIVE now He or she
relentlessly walks toward --

EXT WILL’S HOUSE 22A
As the person approaches the DOOR the TONE gets louder

We finally see the person’s face a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

She presses the DOORBELL The COLOR BARS TONE fades

discovering This woman knows things but she’s never
experienced them
Will brings a tray with a tea cup
She grabs the cup Then moves her lips close to the liquid

extension as a newborn If not I
would say it’s the end

WHITE 17

Will stands up

WILL

Okay From now on you’re not

a cozy house You are a war
prisoner confined in a
concentration camp You were sent
here with your eleven-year-old son
Nick Very smart boy But quite
rebellious too This morning Nick
tried to escape but he was caught
by a sadistic guard who is about to
hang him Nick’s right here

(places a chair there)
standing on this chair with a cord
tied to his neck This small piece
of furniture is the only thing
preventing your beloved son from
being hanged

She doesn’t blink No doubt Will is a great storyteller

WILL (CONTD)
So the guard says

Unexpectedly he SHOUTS impersonating the cruel guard - he’s
a totally different person now Anne almost jumps from the
chair

WILL
PULL THE CHAIR PULL THE CHAIR OR
I WILL NOT ONLY KILL YOUR SON
MYSELF BUT ALL THE OTHER PRISONERS
HERE DO YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPEN

Would you pull the chair or not

Anne is speechless She stutters

ANNE

Will watches her
WILL

No right or wrong answer here Just
say what comes to your mind
WHITE 18

Kyo stares at Will the salesman saying “amazing
opportunity” but not meaning it

chance to be born in a fruitful
environment where you can grow
develop and accomplish Do you want

Kyo chuckles
WHITE 28

KYO
Hmm I’ve never seen it this way
(smiling at Will)
But no I wouldn’t hire Will

EMMA
So you’re an interviewer too

WILL
He can’t interview

EMMA
Why

KYO
Because unfortunately I’ve never
been alive

Emma stares at Will for a moment - “So you were once
alive”
EMMA
Interesting

He avoids eye contact with her

WILL
Ill start a story And then you
tell me how it ends OK

EMMA
Sure

WILL
I want you to imagine you are a war
prisoner in a concentration camp

EMMA
(interrupting)
What kind of war

WILL
Just listen

She nods We keep watching Emma’s face while Will speaks OFF
SCREEN She has the same calm expression the whole time

WILL (0S) (CONTD)
You were sent here with your son
An eleven-year-old kid Nick
Yesterday Nick tried to escape but
he was caught by a sadistic guard
who is about to hang him

(MORE )
WHITE 29

WILL (0S) (CONTD)
You are now looking at Nick over
this chair with a cord tied to his
neck when the guard says

Will shouts Emma’s expression doesn’t change

WILL(OS) (CONTD)
PULL THE CHAIR PULL THE CHAIR OR
I WONT JUST KILL YOUR SON BUT ALL
THE OTHERS TOO IF YOU DON’T PULL
THIS CHAIR EVERYONE HERE DIES
(calm)
What would you do

A moment of silence

WILL (CONTD)
Emma

EMMA
I’m afraid I can’t answer the
question

WILL
Why not

EMMA
The way you put it this guard
will kill my son no matter what I
do correct

WILL
Correct
EMMA
Why
WILL
Because he’s a bad man
EMMA
Why
WILL
Because that’s the way it is
She thinks
EMMA
That’s the way your story is or

that’s the way the world is

WILL
Would you pull the chair or not

WHITE EMMA
Not sure how to answer your
question if you don’t answer mine

They look at each other for a moment

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kyo looks through the window - watches Emma (0S) walking
away Will watches the TVs Emma’s folder is by his side on

the couch

No answer

KYO
So what do you think of her

WILL
She didn’t answer my question

KYO
And how bad is that

WILL
Everyone else answered it

KYO
Maybe she’s more unique than
everyone else

WILL
Maybe Or maybe she’s the most
likely to fall on the battlefield

KYO
You always talk as if you were
sending them to war

WILL
And you always talk as if you’ve
been alive to know anything

KYO
Excuse me

WHITE 31

WILL
You’re excused

Kyo is about to say something but he stops and breathes

KYO

Listen Will I’m not gonna argue
with you again You can cut your
arm off with a plastic knife if you
want I don’t care anymore (Do
whatever you want to yourself)
But (for the selections) it’s my
job to point out what I saw here
And no doubt that

(re Emma’s folder)
- that was unique

WILL
Thanks for the advice I will
consider it deeply

drinks beer with some friends

CUT TO Will reading Maria’s papers INTERCUT with the POV
of a young woman riding a bicycle

Will has Mike’s paper in hands INTERCUT with a man walks on
the beach He steps into the water and feels the waves coming
and going Will sees the last page Mike’s crumpled drawing
of the beach He thinks for a moment then separates Mike’s
block from the rest

Lastly he starts browsing Emma’s block of paper As he keeps
flipping the pages he sees that her writing continues She
wrote A LOT Almost the whole paper block INTERCUT with
numerous clips from the TVs Beautiful little moments - a
woman tries on lipstick a man smiles someone takes a first
sip of his coffee a boy laughs with his friends an old
woman feels the texture of her sweater a man smells the
pages of his book someone jumps into the water a man below
a tree watches the leaves fall The rhythm of the images
becomes faster and faster suddenly ---

It stops Will reaches the end of the block of paper

INT LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 40
Emma watches Fernando’s TV

ON FERNANDO’S TV

He visits the POLICE DEPARTMENT As he enters the building in
his wheelchair all the officers stop what they are doing to
talk to him It’s evident that Fernando was a beloved
officer During his visit we hear random excited lines from
his friends “look who’s here” “you look great” “we miss
you man” Everyone is too nice to him An attentive
observer would almost smell the pity coming from his friends

Will comes in

They watch Fernando’s TV LAUGHS Someone told a joke

WHITE 43
WILL
I read your papers

EMMA
And what did you think

They keep watching the TV

WILL
You could be more selective

KYO

so I was helping Joan two
weeks ago and she had this
candidate who couldn’t stop asking
her where did he come from Joan
very kindly explained she didn’t
know But the candidate

(sighs)
-that guy was a pain in the
nuts”“Where Why How” all the
time So Joan came up with this
really good argument “we don’t
know like the people in the TVs -
who don’t know where they came from
either” That was mind blowing
to me You know It made me
think like what if we’re all
just dogs chasing our own tails I
mean maybe there’s another
parallel dimension where someone
interviewed me and she - or he -
sent me here but I just can’t
remember Can you imagine it
Right now people sit in their
chairs watching our lives without
our knowledge judging us
rooting for us laughing at my
jokes And those people
they’re all being watched by
someone else too who’s being
watched by someone else who’s
being watched by someone else

And isn’t that supposed to be good

into a world different from him
He did have love inside him Maybe

too much too much love and no
one to give it to

uses clips to illustrate what he says

WILL
» then I also searched through
her adult life but I couldn’t find
anything either No signs No
anomalies Of course there were

bad moments But she always
handled them really well You know
that

He plays the car crash Then REWINDS the tape
WHITE 54

WILL (CONTD)
Now look at this here she
got the violin to the car If she
wasn’t driving to the concerto that
day why would she take the violin
with her

Kyo’s face is numb He’s not happy with the investigation
Will inserts another tape and presses PLAY

WILL (CONTD)
One thing got my attention though
You probably remember she rarely
cried even when she was a kid
Like when her mother died

Will plays her mom’s funeral

WILL (CONTD)
No tears nothing she was
always like that very economical
with her emotions The only time
she would let them out was

He shows a clip when she cries while she plays the violin

WILL (CONTD)

- when she played the violin It
makes me think if there’s something
she was always hiding Like a part
of her that we’ve never seen
because she was

KYO
(interrupting)
Will why are you doing this

Will stares at Kyo

WILL
I’m just trying to find out what
happened

KYO

We can’t find out from here
Will is quiet

KYO (CONTD)
Why are you really doing this

WILL
Because I need to know

WHITE KYO
Why

Silence

WILL
Because that’s my duty

KYO
Your duty is to choose someone and
mine is to make sure you chose
well in my opinion And in my
opinion there was no better choice
than her No matter if she did it
on purpose or not
Do you share this same opinion

Will is quiet Maybe he can’t feel the same way about her if

he finds out that she took her own life

KYO (CONTD)
Will

No answer Kyo can’t hide his disappointment

KYO (CONTD)
Alright See you tomorrow

He leaves Will stays accompanied by his doubts only

Do you wanna talk about the moment
you don’t like

hopeless

can’t see

WHITE 56

As Kane talks we INTERCUT with scenes from the TV -
Flashbacks - that represent that moment

KANE
I’ve been following this kid
Rick for the last few days And
every time I see him his
classmates are picking on him
hurting him stealing from him
Every time I don’t like what the
kids do to him But what I hate
most is what Rick doesn’t do He
never reacts Never does anything

As he speaks we see the POV of Rick being bullied The screen
fills with water Rick has tears in his eyes

WILL
And what would you do in his place

KANE
Hit them back

WILL
So in this case you defend
violence

KANE
Violence No it’s not violence

when you didn’t start it

WILL
And what is it

KANE
Justice

55A INT OFFICE ROOM - DAY 55A

Maria speaks Intercuts with the flashback of the moment
she’s talking about a very amateur tennis match

MARIA
So it’s match point Everything
in his favor 1x0 40x15 his
serve He hits the ball Net So
he tries again but more nervous
now Out I think “he’s done it
a thousand times he’ll be
alright” But I’m wrong
Out Net Net And it’s all
downhill from here
WHITE 57

We see it happening as a flashback

MARIA (CONTD)
He loses the game the set the
match
So close to win But he let his
emotions get in the way

55B INT OFFICE ROOM - DAY 55B
Another candidate It’s Alexander who speaks now

ALEXANDER
then she gets the box puts

the donuts and passes it down She
gets the box puts the donuts and
passes it down She gets the box
puts the donuts and passes it down
She gets the box puts the donuts
and passes it down

As he talks we watch the boring repetitive work of a woman
in a donut factory She folds the paper boxes and stacks the
same number of donuts into them Again and again

A moment

ALEXANDER (CONTD)
Did I tell you that she gets the
box puts the donuts and passes it
down

CUT TO

55C INT OFFICE ROOM - DAY 55C

Emma sits opposite of Will She stares at him But because we
are in Will’s perspective it feels like she stares at us

WILL (0S)
So

EMMA
I did what you asked me I’ve
observed several people and I
chose one that I’ve been watching
very closely

WILL
And what don’t you like about this
person

WHITE 58

EMMA
He hates himself
He thinks he’s a failure and that
everything inside him is worthless
and shameful so he raises this
invisible wall around him to
prevent anyone from getting closer -
- No doubt he went through a lot of
pain To a point that he felt so
much that today he just wants to
feel nothing
The numbness makes him think he’s
safe now but I know it’s just
poisoning what’s left of him And
deep inside he knows that too

WILL
This man seems to be
irreparable

EMMA
Yeah he thinks so But I know
there’s still something there

KYO (0S)
Will

Will turns to see Kyo at the office room door
KYO (CONTD)
Sorry to interrupt but Mike is
here already
WILL
(to Emma)
Feel free to spend the rest of your
day in the TV room

Emma keeps her eyes on Will as he leaves

INT CABINET ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
NOISE coming from the other side of the cabinets

Emma enters the room attracted by it The noise is closer
now but she can’t see where it comes from

Suddenly

A CABINET DOOR opens from the inside Kyo comes out of it
revealing the secret room

WHITE 59

KYO
Okay come in
INT STAGE - CONTINUOUS 57
As we pass through the secret door -
We enter a big dark room that reminds us of a STAGE

On a dark corner old costumes props and wooden boxes Emma
is hidden behind them

KYO
Stay here and no matter what
happens don’t let him see you

She nods Kyo heads to the middle of the room
The OPEN CUBE they built the night before is there
The SPOTLIGHT hangs over it

Mike shows up coming from another corner He wears shorts
and a T-shirt He’s followed by Will

Emma watches Will talk to Mike like a director talks to his
actor before a scene

Mike looks down and sees a path made of sand It leads to the
big OPEN CUBE

Will gives a WALKMAN to him Mike presses PLAY and starts
hearing the sound of the beach waves birds people

Mike closes his eyes and walks through the path of sand Will
guides him from behind As Mike reaches the big OPEN CUBE we
see that it’s filled with water like a mini swimming pool
Will helps him step into the water

Kyo TURNS ON the SPOTLIGHT and directs the strong beam of
light toward Mike’s face

Mike still with his eyes closed feels the heat from the
“sunlight” on his face He feels it with his hands too

Then Will gently moves his hands inside the water making
some small waves They reach Mike’s feet A smile He hears
the sounds feels the water and then the WIND Kyo has
just turned on a FAN

We’ve never seen so much joy on Mike’s face

WHITE 60

In the dark corner Emma watches hidden behind the wooden
boxes

Gradually the spotlight FADES The “sun” is gone And the
tape reaches the end

Silence

Will comes closer Mike’s breathing becomes stronger and
stronger He knows what is coming

His anxiety increases he starts to cry in silence Will
gently lays his hand on his shoulder to calm him down

We don’t see them anymore just their shadows on the floor

Mike’s shadow slowly disappears His breathing is replaced by
silence

OMITTED 58

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 59

Will sees Emma watching the TVs - as if she has been here
the whole time

WILL
Thanks for your help The candidate
really enjoyed the moment

EMMA
Glad to hear that

They continue watching the TVs for a moment Finally ---

WILL
The man you were talking about
this afternoon

For the first time Will’s opening up --

WILL (CONTD)
in high school he was part of
this theater group He never liked
it and no one liked him either
But for his parents it meant
something so he didn’t mind
picking an insignificant role say
one or two lines on stage and get
off unnoticed
(moment )
Nevertheless
(MORE)
WHITE WILL (CONTD)
two days before the opening night
the main actor Sam got really
sick He wasn’t the best one to
replace him for sure but he had
the best memory in the group and
Sam’s monologues were quite long to
learn in such a short time On top
of that if the group had to blame
anyone better blame someone they
didn’t like and he fit the role
perfectly In the next 48 hours
the poor kid was moved by this
constant terror of screwing up in
front of everyone
He read and re-read that monologue
hundreds and hundreds of times
till the minute before the curtains
opened

Will looks at his own hands

WILL (CONTD)

His hands were sweating
shaking But when he stepped on
stage and said his first words
something weird happened the fear
was gone Line after line this
strange warm feeling came to him
like if he wasn’t invisible
anymore He was all over the
room becoming one with all those
strangers watching
And the words vibrating
everywhere Yet no longer coming
from him But through him As if
his body was nothing but a vessel

(pause)
He can’t explain it --- even
looking back now a glimpse of
something he’s never touched
before and that he will never
touch again

EMMA
And that’s the moment that he’d
like to experience one more time

WILL
No Not at all

EMMA
Why

WHITE 62

WILL
Because it would make him feel
alive again

A moment

WILL (CONTD)
I’m telling you this because I

think you have some talent But
if you really want to survive
that

(points to the TVs)
youll need to be tougher In a
way this man wasn’t

Emma thinks

EMMA
And how do I know the man is
telling me the truth now that I
found out he was a great actor

They look at each other --- Will almost smiles

61 INT STAGE ROOM - NIGHT 61

Will stands in the middle of the room staring at the
spotlight for a moment As he stays still - thinking - he
reminds us of an artist just about to perform

61A INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 61A

Emma drinks tea at the table Kyo comes closer

KYO
Doing some overtime here

EMMA
Just about to head out

He sits by her side Gets some tea

EMMA (CONTD)
Kyo

KYO
Yes
WHITE EMMA
Why do you do this job

A moment

KYO
Because there’s nothing better
to do here

EMMA
Couldn’t you quit

Kyo almost chuckles

EMMA (CONTD)
What

KYO
We all try But trust me not
having something to occupy the mind
can be worse than torture

EMMA
So this is just to occupy your
mind No hopes No aspirations

KYO
No
(moment )
We all expect things Things to
happen in case we do our job well

EMMA
And do things really happen

KYO
We hear stories

EMMA
And what do you expect here Kyo

KYO
The same as you I presume

A moment

EMMA
What about Will

KYO
Will is different
(moment )
he wants the opposite and no
one can convince him otherwise

WHITE 64
EMMA
And what is the opposite
He’s quiet for a moment
KYO
To vanish once for all
Silence Emma thinks for a beat
KYO (CONTD)
I hope you can stay here until the
end of the process You do him
good

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT 62

crash projected on the wall

EMMA
I would talk to them again

Will watches her then goes for the next clip

67D INT PROJECTION ROOM - DAY 67D

Back to Alexanders session The next clip shows a barbecue
in the backyard

ALEXANDER
And what is that

Will leaves the room Alexander is puzzled He comes back
with two bottles of beer Will opens one and gives it to
Alexander The other one he just uses as a prop to pretend
that he’s drinking The projection on the wall creates the
illusion that they are in a big backyard having a barbecue

Alexander smiles and takes a big sip He raises the bottle to
toast

ALEXANDER (CONTD)
To our six day friendship

They touch bottles Alexander drinks the beer Will holds his
bottle just to keep him company

ALEXANDER (CONTD)
(drinking)
Three more days to go

Will nods noticing some anxiety from him

She blushes

WILL (CONTD)
Yes Maria

She tries to find the right words

MARIA
I I really appreciate the
opportunity you’re giving me here
And there’s nothing I want more
than a chance in the real world

(moment )

But sometimes Sometimes I
have thoughts

WILL
What thoughts

MARIA
I
(she can’t say it)
I think I forgot
WILL
If you remember I’1l be in the
next room
She nods --- Will leaves
Maria stays by herself She closes her eyes and
unexpectedly SLAPS her own face
INT OFFICE ROOM - EVENING

Will is at the desk reading the assignments when Maria
comes in - excited and scared at the same time

MARIA
I left my assignment on the desk

WILL
Thanks Maria

Maria keeps staring at Will All her muscles tense

Looking forward to reading it

She nods Stares at Will and leaves

- her heart rushing inside her chest

INT PROJECTION ROOM - NIGHT

Will comes into the dark room and looks at the desk

finds something else an envelope - folded by her
He reads To Will

Inside the envelope a letter

He starts reading it

A moment on his face

He finishes reading it Puts the letter down

A very long beat
Suddenly

COLLEN

WILL
She used to play with one of the
creators of the show

COLLEEN
That kid was something
(moment )
You must be very proud of her

Will

Nothing A deep silence Then

COLLEN
You know like you I’ve been
alive too I mean I understand

how difficult it can be sometimes
but you
WHITE 71

WILL
Let’s not talk about me Why did
you come here

Kyo gets back from the kitchen he looks at Colleen

Silence Colleen goes for her pocket she picks up a mini VHS
tape and gives it to Will

INT PROJECTION ROOM - NIGHT 73

Will turns on the projector inserts the VHS tape into the
VCR and presses PLAY

PROJECTED ON THE WALL POV of Cecily Her family sits at the
table quiet An older woman gives her a piece of paper It’s
a letter She starts reading it

COLLEEN
They found this after Amanda
died

Will pauses the video so that he can read the letter
projected on the wall

He keeps still reading it His face is numb After he
finishes it

deep silence

Will’s eyes are dead No muscle in his whole body moves Kyo
and Colleen wait for him to say something

WILL
I didn’t see her writing it

COLLEEN
(comforting)
Sometimes it’s hard to keep
track of all of them

Will looks at the projection again

WILL

No that’s not hers
KYO

What
WILL

That’s not hers I didn’t see her
writing it
WHITE 72

Will walks away Kyo goes after him

KYO
Will

He turns avoiding to look at them His sorrow erupting

WILL
Just go Just go

Will makes an effort to keep his emotions numb But this time
it’s hard even for him

KYO
Will I’m sorry if I did what I
did I just wanted you to move on

WILL
Get out

KYO
No

Kyo stares at him Not as a coworker but as a friend
KYO (CONTD)
You know how hard it is for me

to watch what you do to yourself

WILL

COLLEEN
(to Kyo)
Just give him some time
Kyo watches Will walk away There’s nothing he can do now
he leaves the house with Colleen

73A CORRIDORCABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS 73A

He rushes to the --

CABINET ROOM

WHITE 73

WILL (CONTD)
She didn’t do it She didn’t She
didn’t do it
It gets harder for him to believe his own words

Will opens Amanda’s cabinet His shaking hands grab some of
her VHS tapes but drops them

He stares at the tapes on the floor for a while then
suddenly

He erupts and PUNCHES the cabinet
Harder and harder Again and again

He YELLS but not much sound comes out of his mouth just
pain But all of a sudden

He stops

Will quickly recomposes himself In a few seconds he looks
calm again - at least on the outside

He stares at space for a moment Then grabs the tapes put
them into the cabinet and shuts it as if nothing happened

INT OFFICE ROOM - DAY 74
DAY SEVEN

Will talks to someone who sits opposite of him We can’t
identify the person yet

WILL
I understand it’s not easy to
receive this kind of news
But I want you to take advantage of
the remaining hours to write down a
moment truly meaningful for you If
you allow me I will do my best to
recreate the moment for your
experience

He slides a piece of paper over the table As a hand grabs it
from the other side we see who he’s talking to

It’s MARIA Or what’s left of her

A long silence
WHITE 74

MARIA
Is this because of what I wrote to
you

WILL

No It isn’t

MARIA
I knew I shouldn’t have written
that letter but something inside
me I couldn’t stop it sol
thought that maybe it meant
something that maybe you felt
the same way

Silence Maria stops looking down and stares at Will’s eyes --

MARIA (CONTD)
I I love you Will

WILL
Maria you’ve known me for less
than seven days We barely talked
There’s no way you can love me

MARIA
But I do

WILL
You’re too young to say that

Silence She looks at the paper

MARIA
Can we be together in the moment I
choose

WILL

You have to be by yourself
Her thoughts spin inside her head Regret gets to her

MARIA
(holding the paper)
Why did I I’m so stupid Why
did I write that letter I thought

you I thought you I’m so
stupid

(moment )
I had a chance and I threw it away
Why did I I knew I shouldn’t
I I fucked it up I Why

Why did I do it

FIRES his gun and hits the bullseye several times

INT PROJECTION ROOM - DAY 76
ON THE WALL POV of a police officer - with his peers -
running down the streets of a rural area chasing a FUGITIVE
The group soon divides - the officer runs by himself

IN HIS POV he sees - in the distance - someone running away
He goes after him The chasing ends as he reaches the
fugitive in an open land

The officer raises his gun ---

FERNANDO
Stop

The fugitive turns

FERNANDO (CONTD)
Put your hands over your head NOW

The officer has the fugitive on target but the fugitive
starts moving his hand anyway

FERNANDO (CONTD)
HANDS OVER YOUR HEAD OR I SHOOT

The man stares at the officer’s eyes (Because we are in his
POV it’s as if he was looking at us) The Fugitive slowly
moves his hands towards his belt

FERNANDO (CONTD)
Don’t make me shoot you

The fugitive goes for his pistol Even though the officer has
his gun raised and ready he CAN’T PULL the trigger

The fugitive doesn’t hesitate --
BANG

The fugitive escapes while the officer falls to the ground
WHITE 76

He looks at his body and finds a BULLET WOUND close to his
belly A lot of blood

FERNANDO (CONTD)
No no No

But it’s not the wound that scares him most He looks at his
legs and taps them several times

FERNANDO (CONTD)
Shit Shit Shit

He taps his legs harder Punches them His despair raising
-- when suddenly
The image is PAUSED
Emma and Will watch the scene in the projection room

INT HALLWAY —- LATER 78

Kane walks down the hallway When he’s about to reach the
door he turns his head to see Will coming closer

Will does a brusque movement - a quick test - just to see
what’s Kane’s primal reaction

By instinct Kane raises his fists - ready to fight
Will rewards him with an Envelope Will walks away Kane
opens it to find an invitation paper Close on his eyes while

reading it

He nods - there’s satisfaction on his face but no smile
Finally he opens the door and leaves

He stares at Will’s serious face

behind his back

So it’s not funny anymore

Alexander moans A pain he’s never felt before

ALEXANDER
Will stop

WILL
You need to relax (you need to
work on your sense of humor)

He twists it more

ALEXANDER

WILL
This is not even a fraction of the
pain you would feel if you were
alive

He releases it Alexander slumps to the ground

the center of the room - like a gym bicycle fixed to the
floor

Maria sits on it wearing HEADPHONES

Will TURNS ON the video projector On the wall the POV of a
bicycle ride right in front of Maria

The projection creates the illusion that Maria is moving -
like a video game POV While she pedals she sees the
projection of the fast road The WALKMAN plays the ambient
sound cars birds people

PROJECTED ON THE WALL Maria sees an uphill -- the speed
slows down

Then

The projection changes - it’s the POV of the cyclist going
down hill extremely fast

We hear something SWITCHING ON in the stage

It’s a fan Kyo points it to Maria’s hair She closes her
eyes Opens her arms feeling the wind

The ride is almost finished when Maria sees the projection of
beautiful cherry trees passing by her very fast

The blossoms fall

CLICK

She looks up --

Real CHERRY TREE BLOSSOMS falling over her head on the

stage As they touch the floor we discover that they are
actually thin wood chips painted pink
WHITE 85
She opens her hands to feel each wooden blossom with the tip
of her fingers
As she tries to touch them her hands deflect the light from
the projector creating a beautiful superimposed effect with
lights and colors in her arms
She has never felt like this She feels alive
Will watches her At this moment we find out that Emma is on
the opposite corner hidden behind the wooden boxes She

watches the scene too

The ride projected on the wall comes to an end Maria stops
pedaling as well

Silence
The video projector TURNS OFF At last the spotlight fades
It’s darker now

Maria stays still on the bicycle her breathing gets faster
as Will comes closer She knows what’s about to happen

Will tries to calm her down He lays his hand on her
shoulder Nevertheless her breathing is even faster now

MARIA
Will I can’t do this

WILL
It’s okay Maria
It’s gonna be okay

She’s so nervous that she forgets to breathe She coughs

MARIA
Please don’t do this to me
WILL
I’m sorry There’s nothing I can

do

She looks at her hands and notices they start to disappear
Because she is totally conscious her despair is even bigger

MARIA
Will Will What’s happening
WHAT’S HAPPENING

She’s about to have a breakdown when Will holds her hands
Tears trickle down her face

WHITE 86

MARIA (CONTD)
Please I don’t wanna go Give me
another chance I won’t screw up
this time please please
don’t let me go Don’t let me go
Will Don’t let me go

Unexpectedly Will starts humming a song -- Like a father who
tries to calm down his child

Maria gradually quiets down Crying in silence She starts
to hum the song too following Will’s melody

CLOSE ON Will’s hand holding hers until --
Maria’s hand is not there anymore

WIDE she completely disappeared

INT CABINET ROOM - NIGHT 88

Will and Kyo enter the room through the secret door in the
cabinet

They hear sounds from the living room Emma is there
WILL
I thought I told you to dismiss her
for today

KYO
I’m sorry I think I forgot

A moment

WILL
Why are you doing this

KYO
Doing what

WILL
Doing this

Kyo stares at Will for a moment

KYO
I just want to open your eyes

He shakes his head

WILL
She doesn’t fit
WHITE KYO
So why do you keep her in the
house

WILL
(thinks )
Ok I’m eliminating her tonight
KYO
What Why
WILL

Because she didn’t show me what I
needed to see from her

KYO
Let me guess You want her to be
tough Maybe kill someone

WILL
and you want me to choose a
prey like the one I sent before

KYO
A prey A prey What the fuck is
wrong with you A week ago Amanda
was your pride Your concerto girl

Now she’s she’s a failure to
you
WILL
She’s not a failu
(stops)

You wouldn’t understand because

KYO
Because I’ve never been alive
That’s what you’re gonna say

WILL
Yes That’s exactly what I was
going to say

KYO
(staring at him)
You know what I hate most about
you Will That look in your eyes -
as if you knew everything when you
just shat on the opportunity you
had

WILL
Ah the opportunity
(nervous chuckles)
(MORE)

WHITE 88

WILL (CONTD)

God I really wish you have it
so you can stop this non-sense
jealousy
KYO WILL (CONTD)
I’m not jealous And you don’t even know it

KYO (CONTD)

Why do you need to make it about
me or you Will I’m talking about
Emma and giving her a chance

WILL
Yeah let’s send her That’s a
great idea -- I send flowers and

everyone send pigs to eat them

KYO
CANT YOU SEE IF ALL INTERVIEWERS
THINK LIKE YOU NOTHING’S GONNA
CHANGE

WILL
AND IF I CHANGE WHEN NO ONE DOES
IT’S NO CHANGE YOU DUMBARD IT’S
SACRIFICE

They turn their heads and suddenly notice that Emma is there
She’s been watching them for a while

EMMA
It’s Rick
CUT TO
Kyo Will and Emma rush to the --
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 89

They watch Rick’s TV POV of him running away chased by a
furious kid threatening him as we’ve never seen before
“Youre dead motherfucker You’re dead”

WILL
What happened

EMMA
He reacted

Rick keeps running away Every time he turns back the bully
is a bit closer Until

WHITE 89

he reaches Rick and tackles him to the ground By
instinct Rick grabs a rock from the ground and hits the
aggressor in the face Dizzy the kid stumbles then falls
Rick releases all the anger that he’s been holding for the
last years He keeps beating the kid Kicks punches
slaps It’s clumsy and brutal at the same time Cathartic
at first but then just sad

The kid can only protect his face until he passes out

Rick stands up breathless He stares at the kid’s face
blood and cuts everywhere

Then he looks at his own hands covered in blood

Suddenly he yells in confusion and anger less like a
person more like a beast

Will Kyo and Emma stare at that image

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT 90

Emma is about to leave She reaches the front door to see an
ENVELOPE on the door knob She opens it and reads the
invitation paper Her face lights up

Kyo watches her from a distant room He sees Emma opening the
door and leaving

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 91

Kyo comes in and sees Will at the table For the first time
drinking something a bottle of beer

KYO
You didn’t eliminate her

No answer

KYO (CONTD)
What are you thinking

WILL
What am I thinking I’m thinking
about this man who lost his right
arm in a car accident After
struggling with the disability for
years he finally decides to put an
end to his suffering He goes to
the high bridge stands on the
railing But when he looks down
to jump

(MORE)
WHITE WILL (CONTD)
he sees a guy with no arms dancing
all around on the river bank below
He thinks Wow Life isnt so bad
after all Look at that guy No
arms and dancing so happily
Inspired he gets off the railing
and runs down to the river bank to
thank the man “Thank you so much
sir I was going to end my life
but when I saw you dancing with so
much joy I changed my mind
Dancing Im not dancing you
stupid My asshole itches and I
cant scratch it

A moment No laughs No smiles A morbid silence

KYO
I didn’t know you were funny

Silence as Kyo sits by his side
KYO (CONTD)
Anything else besides this
spectacular joke
He stays there for a very long moment waiting

No answer Kyo finally gives up and stands

KYO (CONTD)
Alright

As he heads out

WILL
Why do you think she did it
KYO
She’s dead Will Why does it
matter
WILL

It matters because she is dead
Will takes a sip from his drink

WILL (CONTD)
Twenty-eight years watching her
and I couldn’t see a warning sign

KYO
Even if you saw all the signs What
could you do from here

WHITE WILL
Nothing You’re right I could do
nothing I can only send them to
that shit-hole and say “Survive
That”

KYO
Shit-hole

WILL

Shit-hole A hole filled with shit

KYO
I got the metaphor

KYO (CONTD)
That’s because you’re smart Kyo
Very smart I’m dumb Dumb dumb
dumb So dumb that I couldn’t
even see it when I chose her

KYO (CONTD)
See what

WILL
See that she was just like me

Kyo has never seen him so vulnerable

Silence

A moment

KYO
You had great potential Will you
know that

WILL
Great potential for what To fail

KYO
You didn’t fail Will

WILL
So why am I here

Kyo doesn’t know

KYO

What about the good memories Will

WILL
Good memory bad memory it’s
just one same thing now that
still hurts no matter how deep I
bury it Like a sharp dagger

WHITE 92

WILL (CONTD)

carving from inside to outside

digging out digging out

His hands show the imaginary dagger digging out his gut
WILL (CONTD)
in a way no one else can see
and only I can feel

Kyo stares at Will moved

WILL (CONTD)
And now

KYO
Now what

WILL
Now I know that she felt the
same way

Silence For the first time Kyo seems to understand Will

INT PROJECTION ROOM - NIGHT 92

PROJECTED ON THE WALL Amanda plays the Violin - a very
emotional song

INTERCUT WITH

EXT DESERT - SAME 93
(As we keep listening to Amanda‘song)

Alexander aimless walks through the desert singing in
despair He passes through a haze

There still singing he gradually disappears

BACK TO

INT PROJECTION ROOM - SAME 94

IN THE PROJECTION As Amanda keeps playing the emotional
song tears come out of her eyes

Will watches it He used to think that she was just feeling
the music playing with her heart but he’1l never think
like that anymore

More tears come from Amanda’s eyes when suddenly

WHITE 93

Will STOPS the tape
Silence

PRE-LAP COLOR BAR TONE

EXT DESERT - LATER 95
WIDE a big FLAME dancing while trying to reach the sky
We get closer to it and realize that Will burns all Amanda’s
tapes and notes Everything that he recorded or wrote of her
in the last twenty-eight years is turned into ashes

The COLOR BAR TONE ESCALATES louder and creepier the
tension building up

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 96
CLOSE on the color bars TV Suddenly ---

The tone stops and the color bars are replaced by a warm
MAGENTA-ORANGE SCREEN The colors PULSE becoming darker and

lighter The rhythm reminds us of a heart beating This is
life just about to begin

EXT DESERT - DAY 99
DAY NINE

We follow Emma walking through the desert It’s the first
time we see the world through her perspective

She stops in front of WILL’S HOUSE picks the ENVELOPE out of
her pocket and RINGS the doorbell once

Emma takes a deep breath She looks around to admire a world
that she might not see again Strangely she notices
something she’s never experienced before Her hands slightly
shake

Is she anxious

Suddenly

WHITE 94

Kyo opens the door

KYO
Welcome madam

Emma smiles and enters the house She shows him the envelope

EMMA
Do you need to see the invitation

Kyo takes the envelope from her As they walk down the
corridor he goofily looks at it against the light like a
one hundred-dollar bill - “checking” if it’s not fake

KYO
Yup It’s an original

She smiles Kyo walks her to the --

INT LIVING ROOM —- CONTINUOUS 100

Kane is already there waiting while he watches the TVs Kyo
introduces them to each other

KYO
Emma Kane

They shake hands

EMMA
It’s a pleasure to meet you

KANE
The pleasure is mine

KYO
I have to go back now A delicious
dinner will be served soon

Kyo heads to the kitchen Emma and Kane stay in the room
quiet They turn their heads to see Will cooking and Kyo
helping him

Kane watches the MAGENTA-ORANGE SCREEN(the former color bars
TV) It PULSES becoming darker and lighter - almost like a
countdown

Emma watches it too

Anxiety in the air An uncomfortable silence Broken by

KANE
So this is the last day

WHITE 95

EMMA
Are you afraid

KANE
Of what

EMMA
Of what might happen here

A quick moment
KANE
No
(is he lying)
Are you afraid

Emma thinks for a moment Tries to understand what she’s
feeling

EMMA
Yes I think I am

EXT BACKYARD - LATER 101
The group sits around a desk covered by a tablecloth

CLOSE on the leftovers on the messy table Even at this point
- almost the end of the dinner - everything looks appetizing

Kyo Emma and Kane talk while finish eating
Will’s quiet He’s the only one who doesn’t eat
Kyo drinks his beer

KYO
So where did I stop

KANE
The most disgusting thing you’ve
ever watched

KYO
Yes

WILL
Actually I’m not sure if it’s the
best topic to discuss here

EMMA KANE
We’re finished We’re good
WHITE KYO
(to Will)
They’re good
(to them)
So I saw this happening some
years ago But it still gives me
the shivers I’m watching this

girl driving back home pissed out
of her head with the best matte
completely wasted in the back as
well Until (bump) the car passes
over a bump Her matte wakes up
desperate to puke his guts out
“Stop the car” But the girl
refuses She’s too paranoid the
police will come from nowhere To
deal with the situation what does
he do He does puke but in his
mouth I mean that semi-
digested dinner keept all inside

Kyo bulges his cheek to demonstrate

EMMA
Ugh

KYO
And to keep her mom’s car safe and
clean he heroically swallows
everything back

More reactions

KYO (CONTD)

But as he swallows it the taste is
so bad but so fucking bad
that he feels like puking again So
he keeps this cycle of puking and
swallowing puking and
swallowing until he finally gets
home and just pukes his guts out

(does a toilet flush

sound)
End of the story

We see Emma’s and Kane’s disgusted faces
Kyo taps Kane’s lap twice

KYO (CONTD)
You’re next champ

KANE
What
WHITE 97

KYO
A story more disgusting than mine

KANE

(thinks )
Yeah Puking is disgusting But you
know what’s more disgusting Some
days ago I watched the news of 5
middle school girls who went
missingEveryone in the city
started looking for them Their
parents were very hopeful it was
just a prank or something But
two days later the authorities
found out they were dead Their
English teacher a 60-year-old man
raped and killed those girls - not
necessarily in that order - and
buried them in his backyard When
the police asked him why he did it
he answered it was because he was
in love with them I thought that
was pretty disgusting

Silence

EMMA
I don’t think that was the type of
disgusting he was referring to

KANE
No But that’s what I find
disgusting

EMMA

Fair enough Just curious why you
brought this isolated case to the
table knowing that it wasn’t what
we were going for here

KANE
Isolated case That happens all the
time

Will watches the discussion attentively They are contrary
forces with equal strength

EMMA
All the time Aren’t you trying to
say exceptions

KANE
Is it a fucking joke Exceptions
What world have you been watching
Silence

WHITE EMMA
Same as you pal

KANE
Funny Because in world I watch
every single day someone is doing
something to hurt someone else
Every single day someone somewhere
takes someone’s else life

EMMA
Why are you focusing on that

KANE
Why are you not focusing on that

EMMA
Sure there are terrible things but
that’s not what we were discussing
here

KYO
(interrupting)
Emma why don’t you talk about
your disgusting moment

EMMA
Well Two days ago I was
watching this young woman who
happened to have a big piece of poo
clogged in her toilet bowl

Kane rolls his eyes

KYO
I like the premise Go on

EMMA
no matter how many times she
flushed the toilet that poo would
stay there like a resilient
soldier strong firm but
ultimately forgotten Until the
night she brings this cute guy to
her apartment who first thing
asks her to use the bathroom
The girl panics “One minute
please” She rushes into the
bathroom opens a toothbrush and
rubs that gigantic brown mass

(MORE )

WHITE 99

EMMA (CONTD)
She rubs it rubs it and rubs
it more until the porcelain is
clean like her conscience Of
course she should’ve thrown the
toothbrush in the trash can right
away But you know she was
drunk he was drunk and as drunk
people start doing other things
things are forgotten Some time
later when they are already in
bed spooning the guy whispers
to her “Hey honey thank you so
much for the tooth brush you left
on the sink for me I really like
the soft ones” Immediately her

eyes pop

Kane provokes her ---

KANE
So that’s all

EMMA
No
Because right before he said that
to her they were passionately
making out

Emma finishes the story cleaning her teeth with her tongue
A moment Kane stares at her --- suddenly

He BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER Emma and Kane laugh together A loud
and pleasurable laugh that Will watches in silence

OMITTED 102

INT PROJECTION ROOM - NIGHT 103

Kane and Emma sit side by side Like in Alexander scene they
wait there for a very long beat

Will enters the room pulls a chair and sits close to them

WILL
Now that you had some time to know
each other and saw things that
maybe I haven’t I have a simple
request
(moment )
(MORE )

WHITE 100

WILL (CONTD)
I want you to tell me why the
person in front of you doesn’t
deserve to be alive

Emma stares at Kane Kane stares at Emma The same people who
were laughing together now are forced to destroy each other

WILL (CONT’D) (CONTD)
Who wants to start

Emma stands up

She looks at Will for a moment he looks down With no
hesitation she walks away and leaves

INT OFFICE ROOM - DAY 104
EPILOGUE
It’s early morning

Will eliminates the last candidate He speaks to someone not
revealed yet (Emma or Kane) The camera slowly moves
gradually revealing the person

WILL
- I understand it’s not easy to
receive this kind of news
But I want you to take advantage of
the remaining hours to write down a
moment truly meaningful for you

As the camera stops moving we see who the person is It’s --
-- EMMA
WILL (CONTD)
» I know it’s not much but If
you allow me I will do my best to
recreate the moment for your
experience

He slides a piece of paper to her

WILL (CONTD)
You can take your time

He stands up and heads to the door But Emma finishes writing
on the paper very quickly Will comes back

He picks up the paper and reads it

A moment of silence
WHITE 101

WILL (CONTD)
You have to choose something else

EMMA
That’s the only thing I can think
of

He stares at the paper for a moment then lays it on the
table

WILL
I’m sorry

He slides the paper back to her He can’t do it

105 INT STAGE ROOM - DAY 105

Will stands in the middle of the room He looks around then
looks up at the SPOTLIGHT

He closes his eyes We hear a mix of sounds that reminds us
of audience mumbles before a play starts

The noise FADES
Then all of a sudden

the spotlight TURNS OFF

106 INT LIVING ROOM - LATER 106

Kane and Will sit on the couch Will gives him the last
instructions

WILL

- and some hours after you leave
the house you’ll feel it As if
you were not here anymore and
your senses were getting unbearably
sharper and stronger You’11l
never remember me or anything that
happened in this place But as I
said before you’ll still be you

KANE
Thank you

WILL
There’s nothing to thank me for

KANE
I’m really sorry for Emma

Will looks at him
WILL

No you’re not But that’s why I

chose you
INT CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS 107
Will organizes the papers and folders from the last nine
days He uses his key to unlock and open a cabinet Then
starts putting the candidate folders inside it
From outside -- KNOCK KNOCK
He keeps organizing the folders in the cabinet

-- KNOCK KNOCK again

The door slowly opens We see Kyo’s face through the cracked
open door

KYO

As she prepares to open the front door --

KYO
Emma

EMMA
Yes

KYO

It was a pleasure
He extends his hand But Emma doesn’t shake it She hugs him

EMMA
The pleasure was mine

Kyo is moved but don’t say anything She turns to the door
and opens it

Nothingness outside
Emma nods goodbye Kyo does the same
As she passes through the door

it SHUTS

He comes closer But when Will grabs the piece of paper a
surprise

he finds out that there’s something handwritten below
the paper on the desk

Emma had written it before she left He reads it --

EMMA (0S)

Will Probably by the time you read
this Ill no longer exist

Im sorry that life didnt go the
way you wanted and that all the
pain you went through doesn’t allow
you to see what I can see right
now I took the freedom to write
all the beautiful moments that I
experienced in this house Look
attentively and you will always
find these moments

Please don’t take them for
granted Because in my nine days
here I never did

Emma

Puzzled and moved Will starts to search through the house
and finds several hidden spots with something Emma wrote

Every time he finds something we see a clip (Flashback) that
represents the moment she wrote

A VIOLIN SONG starts to play The same vivacious song that
Amanda was playing in the beginning of the movie

CLOSE on his hand holding it now TIGHTER when suddenly

PRE LAP

THE FRONT DOOR BURSTS OPEN

EXT WILL’S HOUSE - DAY 112
Will storms out the door He leaves the house and dashes
down the desert

EXT DESERT - CONTINUOUS 113

Will keeps running - with a lot of effort but no sense of
direction

Time passes by --- he still runs
But no matter how many miles he goes through
he can’t find Emma

Gasping he stops ---- Tries to catch his breath
WHITE 106

He looks away hopeless Finally he sees something familiar -
-- a small dot moving very slow It’s her

WITH EMMA

She walks away from us When --

WILL (0S)
Hey

She turns her head and sees Will
WIDE two distant people in the same empty environment

Will comes closer He faces Emma takes her last wish paper
out of his pocket and gives it to her

Emma stays still puzzled

Strangely Will walks some steps away His back turned to
her

Will breathes He inhales exhales inhales exhales
His heart pounds fast Sweat pours from his forehead

He’s not in the safe numb zone anymore He’s nervous and
anxious and scared feelings that he only used to feel
when he was alive

Emma understands what she’s about to watch She sits on the
ground and becomes his audience

Will slowly breathes Inhales exhales inhales
exhales

Time stops Everything is quieter calmer
A second of pure silence

He opens his eyes and finally turns to Emma a brief moment
before he starts his monologue The same one he once
performed in high school so many years ago

WILL (CONTD)
I celebrate myself and sing
myself and what I assume you shall
assume for every atom belonging to
me as good belongs to you I loafe
and invite my soul I lean and
loafe at my ease observing a spear
of summer grass My tongue every
atom of my blood

(MORE )
WHITE 107

WILL (CONTD)
formd from this soil this air
born here of parents born here from
parents the same and their parents
the same I now thirty-seven years
old in perfect health begin hoping
to cease not till death

He warms up Word after word his voice goes from trembling
to firm His hands start moving with purpose not with fear
The hesitation fades as he speaks Anxiety becomes
excitement

WILL (CONTD)
The smoke of my own breath echoes
ripples and buzzed whispers
loveroot silkthread crotch and
vine my respiration and
inspiration the beating of my
heart the passing of blood and
air through my lungs

Each syllable each breath each pause It’s not just words
anymore It’s MUSIC in a tone that only Will could sing

Will’s eyes are unafraid As if he could see something we
can’t Emma doesn’t blink fearing she could miss any
microsecond of it

His feet his hands his legs his arms frenetic yet
elegant moves His body is in total control - like a skillful
dancer who sings his own song

WILL (CONTD)

the sound of the belched words
of my voice words loosed to the
eddies of the wind a few light
kisses a few embraces
reaching around of arms the play
of shine and shade on the trees as
the supple boughs wag the delight
alone or in the rush of the
streets or along the fields and
hill-sides the feeling of
health the full-noon trill
the song of me rising from bed and
meeting the sun

At the peak of intensity Will opens his eyes
He’s in disbelief And so is Emma He feels what he deprived

himself to feel An indescribable mix of joy anger ecstasy
sadness
WHITE 108

He builds the tempo more Fast words Sharp words Coming
from the heart to the lungs to the air to Emma’s
ears to Emma’s heart

WILL (CONTD)

and to die is different from
what any one supposed and luckier
The spotted hawk swoops by and
accuses me he complains of my gab
and my loitering I too am not a
bit tamed I too am untranslatable
I sound my barbaric yawp over the
roofs of the world The last scud
of day holds back for me it flings
my likeness after the rest and true
as any on the shadowd wilds it
coaxes me to the vapor and the
dusk I depart as air I shake my
white locks at the runaway sun I
effuse my flesh in eddies and
drift it in lacy jags

His vocal cords vibrating like a singer trying to reach a
tone never reached

His pain and joy released in the form of a sublime
performance Everything building up up up

Will is totally vulnerable now No walls No armor Just skin
and emotions and sweat And fast breathing And tears
tears that Emma mimics as if she could be Will for a brief
moment

WILL (CONTD)
I bequeath myself to the dirt to
grow from the grass I love If you
want me again look for me under
your boot-soles

A once-in-a-life performance That no one else will ever be
able to watch Just Emma

WILL (CONTD)
You will hardly know who I am or
what I mean but I shall be good
health to you nevertheless
and filter and fibre your blood
Time stops We wait for Will’s last verses

You almost hear the silence in the air ready to burst

Will looks at Emma Emma looks at Will
WHITE 109

A man performing on the desert watched by one person only
We DIVE IN toward him

And for the very first time we see the real Will His arms
his hands his eyes all sweat and tears running down his

face

Will shouldn’t feel such intensity in this world But he
does He feels alive

A moment of pure silence Broken by the very last verses ---
WILL (CONTD)
Failing to fetch me at first keep

encouraged missing me one place
search another I stop somewhere

waiting for you

CLOSE on Emma discovering through Will’s monologue what it’s
like to be alive

Emma smiles fulfilled A delicate genuine smile
Will stares at her and in a FLASH a remembrance
He sees Amanda But she’s not crying in this memory

She is smiling atus

And Will finally smiles too

CUT TO BLACK
