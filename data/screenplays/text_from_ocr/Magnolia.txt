Sad But True And you wanna know what

It must be the way

The thing about chicks and the thing

about this course that were going

through today is how universal the whole
thing is I mean I wish I could sit here
and say that its not -- because the reality
If each chick had something new something
really new that Id never seen before
Fuckin hell Id be in the money Because
Id have to create a hundred new cassettes

a hundred new books a hundred new seminars
and hundred new videos just to deal with each
and every situation a chick could create -
but that is just not the case They are

They are sheep They are to be studied and
watched -- they have patterns that must be

interupted and resisted Id be makin a fuckin
butt load if they were actually as much of

a challenge as they want you to think they are

Reality They Are All The Same

Each and every one of them And once you learn

these methods Youre Set You Dont Have To

Thats it In solid Boom Done Over Why
Because all women are the same Period
End of discussion Sorry Its true Sad But

And anyone who wants to say that these methods
we work by are unfair Yes they are

Guilty as charged And sos the world

as were sitting here and there
isnt a fucking thing -- jesus
how can you tell me to calm down

DR LANDON

I can help you through this the

best I know how but there are certain
things you are gonna have to be
strong about and take care of now

we can go over them but I need to
now that youre listening to me ok

LINDA
just I just -- I just -- Im just
in a fucking state I know hes
going and its like I dont know how
-- just tell me practical things --
What the fuck do I do with his body
What happens when he dies That next moment
What What do I do Then What

DR LANDON
Well thats what Hospice will take care of
for you They will send a nurse someone
who can take care of all of that for you --

LINDA
He has Phil right now

DR LANDON
Phils one of the nurses from the service

LINDA
Yeah

DR LANDON
If youre happy with Phil taking care
of him and helping you thats fine
but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --

LINDA
-- you dont understand its more pain
than before and the fucking morphine pills
arent working hes -- past two days its
like he cant really swallow them and I dont
know if theyre going down -- I cant see inside
his mouth anymore -- Im up all night staring

at him and I dont think the pills are going
down and he moans and he hurts --

DR LANDON
We can fix that because I can give
you -- are you listening

LINDA

Im listening Im getting better

DR LANDON
Do you wanna sit down

LINDA
I need to sit down

DR LANDON
Ok Linda Earl is not gonna make it
Hes dying He is He is dying very
very rapidly --

She breaks a bit more

DR LANDON
Now the thing here is making that experience
as painless and easy as possible for him
you understand Now you need to get in touch
with Hospice care because they can take care of
all those practical things that youre asking
me about -- they are who you call when he dies

He writes a number on his bussiness card hands it over as they
speak

DR LANDON
This is the number for Hospice
Ok Now As far as the morphine pills go
there is something else to consider that
can take the pain away that he is in
there is a very strong and very potent solution
of liquid morphineits a little bottle
with an eye dropper and its easy to get in
his mouth and drop on his tounge and
it will certainly diminish the pain that
he is in but you have to realize that
once you give it to him there really
is no coming back I mean it will certainly
cure his pain but he will float in and
out of consciousness even worse than he
is now Linda I mean any sign of the
recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --

LINDA
-- how the fuck can I say anything
to that -- I dont know what to say to that --

DR LANDON

The job here is to make him as comfortable

as possible -- right now -- our job is to just
try and make it as painless as possible
Right You understand

saying that none of my competitors can say is
this That there is no need for insight or
understanding Things of the past Gone Over

Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is
How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and
ahead of its time this concept is Im
talking about eliminating insight and

as human values GOD DAMN IM GOOD There is
no need for INSIGHT There is no need for
UNDERSTANDING I have found a way to take
any subjective human experience -- in other
words -- all the terrible shit or all the
great shit that youve had happen to you in
your life -- and quickly and easily transform
it in the unconscious mind through the subtle
and cunning use of language The listener-

(in other words The Chick) settles into a very
light very delicate conversationally induced
state NOT A TRANCE mind you but a STATE

A state that is brand new The Systems state
What did I do I REALIZED that concept and put

GWENOVIER
We talked earlier about your mother
And we talked about your father and his death
And I dont want to be challenging or
defeatist here but I have to ask and
I would want to clarify something --

FRANK
Im not sure I hear a question in there

GWENOVIER
Do you remember a Miss Simms

FRANK
I know alotta women and Im sure she remembers

GWENOVIER

She does From when you were a boy

She lived in Tarzana

FRANK
An old stomping ground --is this
the attack portion of the interview
I figured this was coming sooner

No this is about getting something
right and claryfying one of your answers
to an earlier question --

FRANK
Go ahead and waste your time

I was told that your mother died
That your mother died when you were young --

FRANK
And thats what youve heard

was your caretaker and neighbor
after your mother died in 1980

BEAT Frank goes silent

GWENOVIER
In my research I have you listed as
the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge

(beat)
And what I learned from Mrs Simms is that
your mother passed away in 1980

(beat)
See Its my understanding that the information
supplied by you and your company and answers
to questions Ive asked are incorrect Frank
And if Id like to get to the bottom of who you
are and why you are then I think your family
history -- youre accurate family
