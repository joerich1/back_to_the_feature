INCIDENT THE ZOOT SUIT RIOTSJUNE 10 1943
REPORTING OFFICERDWIGHT BUCKY BLEICHERT

EXT BOYLE HEIGHTS - EVERGREEN AND WABASH - DUSK

A WORLD WAR II ERA PERSONNEL CARRIER transports twenty silent
LAPD officers into the heart of downtown Los Angeles The
sounds of glass breaking and men screaming serves as backdrop
for their arrival

We focus in on BUCKY BLEICHERT 26 (The counterpuncher from
the newsreels) as he jumps from the carrier
Buckys minus his gun but plus a WWI tin helmet and a three
pound truncheon

BUCKYS POV

Hundreds of in-uniform GIs use baseball bats and two-by-
fours to beat the shit out of Zoot Suit-wearing Mexicans

Most of the cops wander to the edge of the race riot and
hobnob with the pockets of MPs and Shore Patrol whove chosen
to restore order by cheering on their countrymen against
the outnumbered but equally fierce zooters

Sailors shatter streetlights and shop windows Darkness falls
quickly on what Bucky rightly realizes is chaos

Suddenly Buckys RUNNING--
away from the action

down a side street and onto a
QUIET RESIDENTIAL BLOCK

He slows to a jog trying to gather his thoughts And then a
voice

VOICE
Bleichert Bleichert

EXT A BUNGALOW COURTYARD - SAME

A POLICE OFFICER has THREE MARINES IN DRESS BLUES and ONE
ZOOT SUITER cornered in a center walkway

The marines swipe clumsily at the officer with their two-by-
fours as he bobs back and forth on the balls of his feet
dodging the blows like the ex-fighter he is

VOICE OVER

I already knew him by reputation had our
respective records down pat Lee
Blanchard 43-4-2 as a heavyweight
formerly a regular attraction at the
Hollywood Legion Stadium

The terrified Mexican stands frozen on one side of Blanchard
trying to avoid the entire mess as the policeman parries the
marines blows with his own truncheon

LEE BLANCHARD
Code three Bleichert
Bucky runs into the courtyard and immediately wades in
fending off the marines blows to jab at them with his stick

VOICE OVER
And he knew me Bucky Bleichert light-
heavy 36-0-0 ranked tenth by Ring
magazine in 1937 fighting no-name
opponents in no-mans-land division

On instinct Bucky drops his baton and begins wailing on the
marines with his fists connecting hard punches with soft
midsections

VOICE OVER (contd)
In our first year at Central wed never
spoke--but people spoke of us Opinions
about a fantasy Bleichert-Blanchard
fight and who would win

And now Blanchard moves in lashing vicious truncheon blows
to the shoulders of the marines sending them one by one into
a heap

VOICE OVER (contd)
Id heard almost all of em Blanchard by
early KO Bleichert by decision
Blanchard stopped on cuts--everything but
Bleichert by knockout

The marines reduced to rubble Lee Blanchard turns his
attention to the Zooter he slaps handcuffs on him and leads
him away He motions for Bucky to follow

Lee turns back to the marines

LEE
To the halls of Tripoli shitbirds

One of them flips Lee off The Zooter kicks him in the chest
as Lee pulls him away from them laughing

The three men start back toward the riots Gunshots can be
heard Palm trees blaze up into the night

LEE (contd)
(re the Zooter)
Bucky Bleichert meet Senor Tomas Dos
Santos subject of an all-points fugitive
warrant for manslaughter committed during

Before the war the City of the Angels
was graced with two local fighters born
and raised a scant five miles apart
pugilists with styles as different as
fire and ice Lee Blanchard was a
bowlegged windmill of a leather slinger--

CHIEF GREEN
Skip down to the fire and ice part

BUCKY
(searching finding)

Mr Fire and Mr Ice never fought each
other but a sense of duty brought them
together in spirit and both joined the
Los Angeles Police Department Blanchard
cracked the baffling Boulevard-Citizens
bank robbery case in 1939 and captured
thrill-killer Tomas Dos Santos Bleichert
served with distinction during the 43
Zoot Suit Wars--

A glance to Lee
Blanchard

CHIEF GREEN
Skip to the end

Both men made great sacrifices to serve
their city and on Election Day voters
are going to be asked to do the same
thing--vote on a five million dollar bond
proposal to upgrade the LAPDs equipment
and provide for an eight percent pay
raise for all personnel Keep in mind the
examples of Mr Fire and Mr Ice Vote
Yes on Proposition B

CHIEF GREEN
Whattya think

BUCKY

leering smile

Even the experienced cops are rattled by the scene They
point and whisper and generally begin to fall into disbelief
and disorder when

CORONER
Questions

RUSS MILLARD
Whats your best guess

CORONER
Heres what she wasnt She wasnt raped
she wasnt pregnant dried semen
indicates voluntary intercourse within
the last weekShe took what Id calla
gentle whipping in the last ten daysIn
terms of the nitty-grittyShe was
probably tortured with a knife for thirty-
six to forty-eight hours before death
The cause of which is either the mouth
wound or more likely she was beaten to
death with something like a baseball bat

LEE
What about her insides

CORONER
They came out after death Then Id say
he drained the blood from the body and
washed it clean probably in a bathtub

LEE
Did the guy know anything about medicine
or anatomy

CORONER
Maybe Probably not a surgeon type--but
that doesnt rule out veterinary
training biological training or my
Pathology for Beginners class at UCLA
Has she got a name yet

The cops look to each other hesitant to speak her name

RUSS MILLARD
Elizabeth Short

CORONER
(saluting heaven)
God love you Elizabeth

INT OUTSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - CONT

Seems like every cop in town has jammed themselves into a
small corridor watching Russ Millard interrogate RED MANLEY
through a one way mirror Manley is carrot-topped 25 and
scared shitless

Millards soothing voice can be heard through speakers

MILLARD
Like I said Robert Were doing this
because you didnt come forward

RED MANLEY
Ive told it three times now I didnt
want my wife to know I was chipping her

MILLARD
But you said you didnt chip on her
Betty wouldnt put out Thats no reason
to hide from the police

RED MANLEY
I dated her down in Dago I slow-danced
with her Its the same thing as
chipping

MILLARD
And you wanted to fuck her didnt you

RED MANLEY
I wantedto test my loyalty to my wife

MILLARD
Come on son

RED MANLEY
I wanted to fuck her Yes

MILLARD
But she cock-teased you

RED MANLEY
She said she had her period--

All of the cops outside laugh
RED MANLEY

Said the father of her child would be a
combat veteran--

MILLARD
And you were in the Army band You get
angry

RED MANLEY

I told you I didnt kill her

MILLARD
You drove her back to LA with you
onDecember tenth And dropped her at
the Biltmore Hotel

RED MANLEY

ways do you went to hear it

Millard straightens up and turns to the one-way mirror He
tugs at the knot of his tie Soon after he slips out of the
room and Harry Sears slips in

Bucky turns to Lee

BACK INSIDE THE INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME

Harry leans close to Red tapping the sap on the table His
stutter completely gone

HARRY SEARS
You wanted some fresh gash and you
thought Betty was easy You came on
strong and that didnt work You offered
her money She told you she was on the
rag and that was the final straw You
wanted to make her bleed for real--

RED MANLEY
No no no Not Betty--

Harry SMASHES the sap onto a glass ashtray shattering it
Red bites down on his lip cutting it

HARRY SEARS
You plied Betty with drinks got her to
talk about her old boyfriends and came on
like a pal like the nice little corporal
willing to leave Betty to the real men
the men who saw combat--

RED MANLEY
No--

Harry SMASHES the table again

HARRY SEARS
You took her to a toolshed maybe one of
those abandoned warehouses out by the old
Ford plant in Pico-Rivera There was some
twine and lots of cutting tools lying
around and you got a hard-on

RED MANLEY
No no no--

Again Harry smashes the table Red almost topples his chair
backwards out of fear only Harrys hand an the back slats
keeping it from going over

She opens the door to her car and slides in Bucky gets in

to the Dahlia is more in her clothes and hair but the
resemblance is still there nonetheless

Speaking of families--

Both Martha and Ramona stand up Martha is 19

plain and

serious with a tenacious resemblance to Emmett (Neither of

whom look much like Madeleine)

Ramona on the other hand possesses a pushing-fifty
resemblance to Madeleine combined with the flaccid face and
unfocused features of a booze or drug addict

BUCKY
German

EMMETT SPRAGUE
A great people the Germans Hitler was a
bit excessive but mark my words that
someday well regret not joining forces
with him to fight the Reds I killed a
lot of your countrymen during the war

MARTHA
Did you meet Balto out in the hallway

BUCKY
Very realistic
EMMETT SPRAGUE
An old friend stuffed him We were in the
Scots regiment together Georgie Tilden
He wanted to work in the flickers

BUCKY
So when did you come here

EMMETT SPRAGUE
1920 Hollywood was a cow pasture but
the silent flickers was booming Georgie
got work as a lighting man and me
building houses
Georgie got me introduced to Mack Sennett
and I helped him build that housing
project he was putting up--Hollywoodland--
underneath that godawful sign

BUCKY
I always loved the Keystone Kops

EMMETT SPRAGUE
Old Mack knew how to squeeze a dollar
dry he did He had extras moonlighting
as laborers and vice versa I used to
drive em over to Hollywoodland after
twelve hours on a Keystone Cops flicker
and put in another six hours by
torchlight Even gave me as assistant
director credit a couple times so
grateful he was for the way I squeezed
his slaves--

A SCREECH interrupts Emmetts monologue Bucky looks across
the table to see Ramona trying to corral a potato with her
fork (the source of the sound)

EMMETT SPRAGUE (contd)
Mother Are you feeling well Would you
like to contribute to the conversation

Ramona forks a small bit of food and chews it daintily

RAMONA
Did you know Mr Bleichert that Ramona
Boulevard was named after me

BUCKY
No Mrs Sprague I didnt

RAMONA
When Emmett married me for my fathers
money he promised my family that he would
use his influence with the City Zoning
Board to have a street named after me
But all he could manage was a dead-end
block in a red light district in Lincoln
Heights Are you familiar with the
neighborhood Mr Bleichert

BUCKY
I grew up there

RAMONA
Then you know that the Mexican
prostitutes expose themselves out of
windows to attract customers I hear many
of them know Mr Sprague by name--

Emmett Sprague SLAMS the table Plates rattle Silence Bucky
stares into his lap as Madeleine grabs his knee tightly

image hits the screen It begins to focus

A title Slave Girls From Hell

The movie A big high-ceiling room with Egyptian
hieroglyphics on the walls Pillars shaped like coiled
serpents are stationed throughout the room the camera zooms
in for a close-up of two inset plaster snakes swallowing each
others tails The snakes dissolve into Betty Short wearing
only stockings and doing an inept hoochie koochie dance

An audible breath in the muster room

A hand reaches into frame passing Betty a large cylindrical
object a dildo scales covering the shaft fangs extending
from the circumcised head Betty puts it in her mouth sucks
it eyes wide open and glassy

An abrupt cut Linda Martin naked lying on a divan Betty
enters the frame with the dildo she puts it between Lindas
legs pushing it inside her Linda rotates her hips trying
her best to fake ecstasy instead of pain and sadness

Another cut Betty mouthing the words No please to the
camera A hand pushing her head down towards Lindas crotch
Betty tonguing next to the dildo

BACK ON THE MUSTER ROOM

The atmosphere is somber but calm The film continues

INT THE STUDY - MORNING

desk chair lies overturned an the ground next to A TAPE
OUTLINE OF A BODY Three feet away lies A SHOTGUN

decorates the white wall and crown mouldings

the main foyer He stops short

ON THE OPPOSING WALL

hangs a disturbing PAINTING the portrait of a clown a young
boy done up in court jesters garb His body is gnarled and
hunched He wears a stuporous ear-to-ear smile that looks
like one continuous deep scar

It is eerily reminiscent of Elizabeth Shorts death wound

Spooked Bucky pulls his eyes away and settles them on nearby
family photos--two young women linked arm in arm

JANE CHAMBERS

two men consulting a treasure map in the woods

In the background is a tiny bungalow with the windows blown
out and the door hanging off its hinges

sourcewhere one could drain a body of
its blood

Bucky and Russ round a bend in the stream and see

THE SKELETON OF A BUNGALOW

teetering on the edge of the stream Empty window and doors
hover over a rotting porch like skull sockets over a death
leer

Bucky and Russ feel it tensing up as they approach They
pick their footsteps carefully through the broken porch and
step into the abandoned house

INT THE BUNGALOW - SAME

A scattering of trash in the front room animal shit a
bicycle tire rags

corner creeps with potential violence Still nothing

From the kitchen

Half the room is taken up by a mattress its blue ticking
stained dark brown with blood A gas lantern sits in the
corner leaning against a stack of blood-spattered books

Who Laughs along with a clutch of pornographic pictures

very intense

from the caked blood on the mattress

piece of paper

make the arrest without admitting that
Id suppressed evidence years ago The
case would always be open

revolver in her fingers and drops it at her feet When she
speaks its with complete control

just like Georgie When he got out of the
hospital I gave him the Hugo book as a

family down around her by chance Her
little stunt about tipping the police to
LaVernes--

BUCKY
She lied about that To get Madeleines
goat

Ramonas eyes brighten up

RAMONA
Oh is that so You poor boy Your life is
