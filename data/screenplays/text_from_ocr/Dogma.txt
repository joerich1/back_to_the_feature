DOGMA
EXT ASBURY PARK BOARDWALK - DAY

Jersey spring day Beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun
pier
the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline

An OLD MAN stares at the empty beach Sun-worshipers hours away from
besmirching the dunes His features are simple He wears an old
overcoat

His face belies good years gone by - a face that has seen more
sunrises

than one would suspect He inhales the crisp salty air and lets a
small

satisfied smile cross his face

Behind him a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the
boardwalk Three young boys skate around by on roller blades passing
a

street hockey ball between them proficiently The Old Man views them
briefly checks his watch and looks back toward the ocean

The skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt We pan
up to

their faces - now cold and dispassionate They look at one another and
nod

Their skates glide out of frame

POV SKATERS - The Old Man leans on the railing that overlooks the
beach
We get closer and closer to him until

One of the skaters checks him hard into the railing The Old Man
exhales

violently and falls to his knees The two other skaters begin savagely
beating on him with their hockey sticks as he crumbles beneath them
Repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head

OC VOICE

I dont understand - how can you base your lack of belief in God on
the

writings Lewis Caroll

The three skaters cease their beating and check the Old Mans pulse
Satisfied they skate away leaving his crumpled form on the

boardwalk

INT AIRPORT - DAY
LOKI walks beside a NUN in a semi-busy terminal They pass through the
metal detectors The Nun carries a donation can

LOKI

Leaving Alice in Wonderland aside look closely at Through the
Looking

Glass - particularly The Walrus and the Carpenter poem whats the
metaphorical meaning

NUN
I wasnt aware there was one
LOKI

Oh but there is - it colorfully details the sham that is organized
religion The Walrus - with his girth and good-nature - obviously
refers to

either the Buddha or - with his tusks - the lovable Hindu elephant
god

Lord Ganesha This takes care of the Eastern religions The Carpenter
is an

obvious reference to Jesus Christ who was purportedly raised the son
ofa

carpenter He represents the Western religions And in the poem what
do

they do They dupe all the oysters into followmg them Then when the
oysters collective guard is down the Walrus and the Carpenter shuck
and

devour the helpless creatures en masse I dont know what that says
to

you but to me it says that following faiths based on these
mythological

figures insures the destruction of ones inner-being

BARTLEBY sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates He
eats
popcorn and stares at

A steady stream of TRAVELERS exiting the gate meeting lovedones
family

oc LOKI

Organized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting
our

actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent-figure who
shakes

a finger at us from thousands of years ago and says No no
Bartleby smiles at the meet-and-greets warmed Loki saddles up beside
him
kneeling on one of the seats facing the Nun

LOKI

Through the Looking Glass - a childrens tale I think not
NUN

(really dazed)

Ive Ive never really thought about it like that

(beat shocked off her cassock)
What have I been doing with my life
LOKI
Dont look back Just get out there and taste life
(off donation can)
Leave this for the unenlightened Poverty is for the gullible - its
another way the church is trying to control you You take that money
youve
been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a

nice
piece of ass You deserve it

The Nun nods at him and saunters off obviously grappling with
something

A passerby tries to stick money in her can but she yanks it away
Loki

faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the
still-transfixed Bartleby

BARTLEBY
(looking OC)
Heres what I dont get about you you know for a fact that there is a
God
Youve been in his presence hes talked to you personally And yet I
just
heard you claim to be an atheist

LOKI

Cmon man - you know I dont believe any of that shit I was telling
her I
just like to fuck with the clergy keep em on their toes When her
head

stops spinning shell be facing the way of the Just again But oh
will

she have a bunch to confess

(looks around)

Now heres what I dont get about you why do you feel the need to
come
here all the time

BARTLEBY
(off travelers)
I like to watch This is humanity at its best Look at them

A reunited FAMILY share a group hug and move on making way for two
young
LOVERS to embrace and kiss passionately

OC BARTLEBY

All that tension all that anger and mistrust forgotten for one
perfect

moment when they come off that plane See those two The guy doesnt
even

know that the girl cheated on him while he was away

Oc LOKI

She did

Bartleby and Loki continue to watch the arrivals
BARTLEBY

Uh-huh Twice But it doesnt matter at this moment because theyre
both so

relieved to be with one another I like that I just wish they could
all

feel that way more offen

LOKI

Maybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would
Now

what was so friggin important that I had to miss cartoons this
morning If

it was to share in your half-assed obsessions with Hallmark moments
Im
going to slug you
BARTLEBY
(still looking OC)
Youre never going to believe this were going home
LOKI
(off Bartlebys popcorn)
Let me have some
BARTLEBY
(pulls out envelope)
Look what somebody sent us in the mail
(hands him a newspaper article and corn)
LOKI
Did you say were going home
(reads)
Cardinal Glick Cuts Ribbon on Catholicism - Wow
Campaign
(to Bartleby)
And
BARTLEBY

Keep reading

LOKI
(reads)
Updating the church television spots Papal consent
rededication

(to Bartleby)
Again - and

BARTLEBY
(snatches article) Give me this
(getting up reading)

The Re-dedication of Saint Michaels Church on its hundredth
anniversary

is the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring the Catholic
Church

back into the mainstream With a papal sanction the archway entrance
to

the centuryold Jersey shore house of worship will serve as a
passageway of

pleanry indulgence which - according to Catholic beliefs - offers all
who

pass through its arches a morally clean slate

(looks at Loki)
You still dont get it do you

LOKI
No I dont get it Are we leaving now
They start walking

BARTLEBY

If you walk through the churchs front door on the day of the Re-
dedication
ceremony your soul is wiped clean of any and all existing sin moreso
than
the sacrament of penance could ever offer Its a plenary indulgence
man
I dont know why I never thought of this before

LOKI
(spits out chewed popcorn into trash can)
Sounds thin Sounds like someone made it up

BARTLEBY

Its rarely employed but its legitimate It has a papal sanction for
Gods sake

LOKI

So youre saying you and I can walk through this doorway and go back
home
BARTLEBY
No - by passing through the doors our sins are
forgiven Then all we have to do is die
LOKI
Wait wait wait - Die I dont want to die
(chews popcorn)
BARTLEBY
(steps on conveyor belt)
Youd rather stay down here for a few more eons
LOKI

No but we dont even know if we can die And what if we can but this
archway thing doesnt pan out What then Hell Fuck that

(spits out chewed popcorn into napkin)
BARTLEBY
Impossible If we cut off our wings and transubstantiate to complete
human
form then we become mortal And if we die with clean souls theres no
way
to keep us out They have to let us in
LOKI
(beat)
Who sent this thing
BARTLEBY
I dont know Somebody whos looking out for us
I guess Does it matter All that matters is that
after all these years weve found a loophole He

cant keep us out anymore And once were back

in Im sure Hell just forgive and forget
They pass the Nun who leans against a wall still dazed
LOKI

Yeah but this plenary indulgence thing is a church law not Divine
Mandate Church laws are fallible because theyre created by man

BARTLEBY

One of the last sacred promises imparted to Peter the first Pope by
the Son
of God before He left was Whatever you hold true on earth
LOKI
Ill hold true in Heaven
BARTLEBY
So if the Pope says its so God must adhere Its dogmatic law
LOKI
(beat extends hand)
Let it never be said that your anal retentive attention to detail
never

yielded positive results
BARTLEBY
(accepts hand)
You cant be anal retentive if you dont have an anus
LOKI

Theres just one thing I think I should do before we leave - something
thatIl get us back on His good side

BARTLEBY

Whats that

Loki smiles and starts rifling through his pockets He extracts a
magazine

article

LOKI

This is something Ive been dreaming about for five years now Read
The crumpled article displays a Barney-like gold-hued cow alongside
various profit charts and text

OC BARTLEBY

(reading)
Mooby the Golden Calf- Creating an Empire Out of Simplicity
Loki wipes his mouth and nods to the article
LOKI
I want to hit them

BARTLEBY
Are you nuts
(crumples article)

Were mere days away from getting back and you want to jeopardize it
because you have a soft spot for the good ol days

LOKI

What better way to show Ive repented than by resuming the position I
denied thanks to you

BARTLEBY
A killing spree is not going to make things better for us
LOKI

Were not talking about killing here Were talking about Divine
Justice

Were talking about punishing the wicked raining down fire and
brimstone

Hes all about that I just know hed want this done

BARTLEBY

There hasnt been an Angel of Death since you quit Doesnt that mean
anything to you Besides what if youre wrong

LOKI

If Im wrong it wont matter Like you said - we pass through the
arch and
were forgiven anyway
They step up to an elevator and press the button
BARTLEBY
(considering it)
Well he does hate competition
(reading article)
And this Mooby deninitely falls under that heading
LOKI
The church we have to go to is where
BARTLEBY
New Jersey The Rededication is in four days
The doors open They get on Other people are inside as well
LOKI
Our last four days on earth If I had a dick Id go get laid But we
can
do the next best thing
BARTLEBY
Whats that
LOKI
Lets kill people

A guy beside Loki reacts Loki smiles at him as the elevator doors
close

PRIEST
Those who find the weekly demonstration outside of

the Twelfth Street Planned Parenthood Clinic hard to make due to work
schedules are urged to show their support in the fight against the
thoughtless and wanton destruction of life by cheering on our boys on
the

field Refreshments as always will be served

Dollying down the rows while the Priest rattles on we pass the
parishoners Some listen intently others are nodding off One
surreptitiously listens to a Walk-man a man and a woman quietly argue
while their kid colors in a coloring book going off the page and
marking

hidden by his hymnal book

OC PRIEST

For those of you who havent been following the news an unidentified
homeless man who was accosted and severely beaten at the New Jersey
shore

last Tuesday lies in critical but stable condition in one of that
areas

hospitals He lacks identification and police have had no luck in
tracking

down any possible family While he shows no signs of recovery the
Arch-Bishop of the Trenton Diocese has disputed the states decision
to

remove the indigent man from life support systems asking that

INT BETHANYS OFFICE - DAY

The source of the voice - a GIRL - sits beside Bethanys desk
stretching
out her gum Bethany offers her an understanding smile

GIRL

You know Ive done this three times now and each time the counselor
tells

me I should be more careful in the future I should show some
responsibility Gotta tell you though - this is the first time the
counselor wasnt some ugly as hell old bitch Its kind of hard to
take

abortion advice from a woman whos too gross to get laid in the first
place

BETHANY

Im not here to lecture you - Im here to make sure you really want to

go
through with this

GIRL
Id rather go back to that night when my idiot bovfriend swore up and
down
he was sterile Short of that there arent many choices left now are

there

BETHANY
Ever think about having it

GIRL

(beat)
What woman doesnt on some level
BETHANY
I never did
GIRL

(incredulous)

You had an abortion

BETHANY

(lights a smoke)

My first year in college All through high school Id dated the same
guy -

Walter Flanagan We were really in love right So much so that we
decided

to go Carnegie Mellon together thats this college in Pittsburgh
So

there we are -away at school and theres suddenly no parents to worry
about anymore so were screwing like rabbits - just constanly doing
it

And I wound up getting pregnant So he begs me to have it He says we
should quit school and get married and Im telling him that thatlI
screw

up our educations We fought about it for a week - my arguement being
there

was no rush to have kids you know We could always have a baby in a
couple

of years - after school So I got the abortion against his wishes I
mean what the hell - it was my body right After graduation we got
married and immediately set about trying to have kids We tried like
hell

for the first six months and nothing So I went to a gynocologist
to

see if everything was okay on my end

(beat)
It wasnt

(takes a drink)
My uteran wall had this fissure It seems that the doctor who
performed the

procedure on me years before had somehow botched it Id never be able
to

have a child

The Girls face says it all Bethany takes a drag and continues
BETHANY

So there I am - devastated And now I have to go home to break the
news to

my husband who years before had begged me to have the baby - his baby
And

after I explain it to him through my tears he sits on the couch and
rubs

his eyes And in the calmest most rational voice Ive ever heard
anybody

use in my life he asks me for a divorce And I fought him you know
I

tried to talk him out of it told him there were alternatives - like
we

could adopt And all he said was he wanted a wife who could have his
children

GIRL

(beat)
What happened

BETHANY

He remarried He had two kids in two years with his new wife We never
spoke again And now I do this

GIRL
Thats like such a sad story

BETHANY

I dated this guy a year or two ago - he was really into comic books
He

told me I had the stock superhero story -I wanted to prevent a wrong
that

had happened to me from ever happening to anyone else Kind of like
Batman

he said The only difference is I dont put on tights to do it
unless

all my other clothes are in the wash
(smiles and puts out her smoke)
So lets go over your paperwork
EXT CLINIC - DAY
A well-dressed LIZ maneuvers through the small thrall of Right-to-

They shake their placards at her accusingly

(looking over their shoulders)

HOLY SHIT ITS THE POPE

As the thrall turns excitedly in an effort try to spy the imaginary
pontiff Liz ducks inside the clinic

INT CLINIC COFFEE ROOM - DAY

A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE fills the frame - CHURCH SAYS NO TO DEATH OF
JOHN
DOE Its lowered to reveal Bethany reading Liz enters and hangs up
her
coat

LIZ

Jesus Youre a Catholic arent you Cant you talk
to them or something

BETHANY

They hate me more than you no doubt At least you have an excuse -
youre
Jewish

you dont know any better

LIZ
I dont think theyd accept that one - we already used it as our
excuse for

killing Christ So where were you yesterday morning - a bunch of us
went

out for brunch

BETHANY

I went to church

LIZ

That kills me You and church We work in a field that specializes in
pissing off the cloth and you add insult to injury by breaking bread
with
them every week

BETHANY

I sit there every Sunday and I feel nothing I can remember sitting in
church when I was a kid and being moved - like everything meant
something

like I was important And the stories of all these holy people were so
inspiring Now I sit there and think about my checking and what Im
going

to wear to work the next day

LIZ
So then why do you still go
BETHANY
(beat)
You wouldnt believe me if I told you
LIZ
You think Im going to mock your religious beliefs Were friends
Bethany
- I may mock you for being a divorce at twenty five whos never had
an
orgasm but Id never mock you for having faith
BETHANY
Thats just it - I dont I dont think I have any faith left

LIZ

(making coffee)
I had a girl in here once - bout fifteen She told me that faith is
like a

glass of water When youre young the glass is full and its easy to
fill

up But the older you get the bigger the glass gets and the same
amount

of water doesnt fill the glass anymore Periodically the glass has
to be

refilled

BETHANY

A fifteen year old who came in here said that
LIZ

She had gotten knocked up by her pastor

BETHANY
Jesus See A minister knocks up a teenager -isnt anyone afraid of
the
Lords wrath anymore

LIZ
That would require faith and that commodity lately seems reserved
only for
the psychotic zealots that hang around outside
(collects her things to leave)
So what are you doing tonight
BETHANY
Watching TV
LIZ
Girl you need a man If only for ten minutes
BETHANY
Its been my experience that the average male is never a man - not
even for
ten minutes in his entire life span

LIZ

Uh-oh - that sounds militant You thinking of joining the other side
BETHANY
Couldnt do it Women are insane
LIZ

Then girl you better get back to church and ask God for a third
option

BETHANY
think God is dead
LIZ
The sign of a true Catholic
Liz exits with her coffee Bethany stares after her

The theme song to Filmations Batman and Robin cartoon can be heard
She

sips some milk from a glass and has some more cake

INT BETHANYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bethanys in bed staring up at the ceiling From the darkness a
creaking

floor board is heard Bethany reacts grabbing a bat from under her
pillow

She peers into the darkness defensively wielding her bat

Suddenly the room explodes in flames A huge fire that appears to be
shooting out from the floor ignites mere feet from Bethanys bed
Bethany

leaps back taking a beat to stare mesmerized Looking closely one
can

see an anthropomorphic form standing in the blaze

VOICE
(powerful booming)
BEHOLD THE METATRON - HERALD OF THE ALMIGHTY AND
VOICEOF THE ONE TRUE GOD

The Voice repeats itself Bethany darts out of bed and dashes out of
the

room quickly returning with a fire extinguisher While the voice is
in

mid-sentence she blasts the thing with the contents of the canister
swirling the nozzle around to hit all the flames The booming Voice
sputters and starts coughing losing its impressive edge Bethany
stops

squirting and turns on her bedside lamp

A choking drenched and coughing androgynous figure in a suit waves

her

away The figure coughs up some of the extinguishers contents and

drops to

the floor hacking It is METATRON Bethany stares shocked
METATRON

(between coughs)

Sweet Jesus Did you have to emptythe whole can

Bethany grabs her bat again and holds it up this time offensively
BETHANY

WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU AND WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM

Im the one whos soaked and shes the one whos pissed Thats
rich

Im calling the cops Breaking and entering attempted arson
theyre
going to lock you up for life

M ETATRON

No dial tone

BETHANY

You cut the phone lines
(even more offensive with bat)
Get the fuck out of here now

METATRON

Or youll what - hit me with that fish

The bat Bethany held is now a salmon She drops it to the floor and
freaks

METATRON
Now just sit down on the bed and shut up
BETHANY

Oh God - youre going to rape me

METATRON
Im not going to rape you
(to itself off clothes)
Look at my suit

BETHANY
Take whatever you want just dont kill or rape me

METATRON
Enough with the raping already I couldnt rape you if I wanted to
(unzips pants and pulls them off)
Angels are ill-equipped
Bethany stares There before her stands the exposed Metatron There
nothing where some sexual genitalia should be - its as smooth and
anatomically impaired as a Ken doll

METATRON
See Im as anatomically impaired as a Ken doll
(rings out pants)
You meat-puppets and your arrogance - you think everyones just
waiting to
rape you

BETHANY
Whwhat are you

METATRON
Im pissed is what I am You go around drenching everyone that comes
into
your room with flameretardent chemicals No wonder you dont get laid
(pulls pants back on)
Go get me a towel will you
Bethany blinks She exits the room and comes back with a towel She

holds
it out to Metatron who grabs it and starts toweling off
METATRON
(taking off jacket)
Stand back
Bethany steps back Metatron flexes and huge fucking wings extend from
its
back dripping water Bethany goes wide-eyed and cowers against the
wall
METATRON
(tosses towel away)
Like I was saying - I am the Metatron
Bethany stares saying nothing pinned against the wall Metatron
looks
insulted
METATRON
Metatron Dont tell me the name doesnt ring a bell
Bethany remains silent and wideyed Metatron gets testy

right

(beat)
I am a seraphim

Bethany slowly nods

METATRON

Metatron acts as the voice of God Any documented occasion when some
yahoo

claims to have spoken with God theyre speaking to me Or theyre
speaking
to themselves
BET HANY
(beat)
Why doesnt God speak for himself
METATRON

Ah So glad you decided to join the conversation To answer that -
Numan

beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to
withstand

the awesome

power of Gods true voice Were you to hear it youre mind would cave
in

and your heart would explode within your chest We went through five
Adams

Dos tequilas por favor And an empty glass

The Waiter turns to leave Metatron yanks a smoke from his pocket as
he

goes
METATRON
Gracias senor
BETHANY
Were in Mexico
METATRON

Actually were in the Chillis down the street from your house but
it was
still an impressive trick

(lights smoke)

You dont mind that I lost the wings do you Im trying to keep our
profile low

BETHANY

I suppose it would be too cliche to observe aloud that this is the
weirdest
dream Ive ever had
METATRON
Can you imagine how insulting it is to converse with a person and have
them
insist youre a dream If I had an ego itd be bruised
BETHANY
What do you want with me
METATRON
Im to charge you with a holy crusade
(pause)
You do know what a crusade is dont you
BETHANY
(sarcastically)
Uh yeah
METATRON
Dont give me that Last time I charged someone with a crusade they
had to
look the word up
BETHANY
Why am I supposed to go on a crusade

METATRON

Yours is a heritage divine Also you didnt seem to be doing much
lately

The Waiter arrives with their drinks
METATRON
Oh - Gracias
(he leaves off the tequila)
One of the only things your people have mastered since you crawled

from the
primordial ooze
(sips)

BETHANY
I work in an abortion clinic

METATRON

Moses was a drunk Look what he accomplished And no ones even asking
you
to part an ocean All you have to do is go to New Jersey

BETH ANY
New Jersey

METATRON

Sure Go to New Jersey and visit and small church on a very important

day
Agreed
BETHANY
That doesnt sound like a crusade
METATRON

Aside from the fine print thats it

BETHANY
Whats the fine print

METATRON

(mumbles into glass)
stopacoupleofangelsfromenteringandthusnegatingallexistence
Damn this is good tequila
(sips)

BETHANY
Wait wait wait Repeat that

METATRON
Damn this is good tequila
BETHANY
The first part
METATRON
(spits into empty glass)

Details Stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all
existence God I hate when people need it spelled out for them

BETHANY
Clarify that
METATRON

Thats the problem with you people - you need every-thing clarified
No

leaps of faith whatsoever Alright -vou want the whole secret origin
Here

goes Back in the old days God was vengeful and hot-tempered and his
wrath was bore by the Angel of Death - name of Loki When Sodom and
Gommorah were destroyed That was Loki When the waters wiped out
everything with the exception of Noah and his menagerie That was
Loki And

he was good at what he did But one day he refused to bear Gods
wrath any

longer

BETHANY
Why
METATRON
Because he listened to his friend - a Grigori by the name of Bartleby
BETHANY
Grigori
METATRON

One of the choirs of angels Theyre called Watchers Guess what they
do

BETHANY
So theyre like Guardian angels
METATRON

Exactly like that but different So one day Lokis wiping out all
the
first born of Egypt

BETHANY

The Tenth Plague
METATRON

See Tell a person youre the Metatron and they stare at you blankiy
mention something out of a Charlton Heston movie and theyre suddenly
theology scholars May I continue uninterrupted

(Bethany nods)

So once hes done with the first born Loki takes his friend Bartleby
out

for a post-slaughter drink And over many rounds they get into this
discussion about whether or not murder in the name of God is okay
Now
Bartleby can run circles around Loki intellectually not to mention
the
fact that Lokis more than half in the bag and in the end Bartleby
convinces Loki to quit his position and take a lesser one - one that
doesnt involve slaughter So - very inebriated - Loki tells God he
quits
throws down his fiery sword gives him the finger - which ruins it for
the
rest of us because from that day forward God decreed that angels
could no

longer imbibe alcohol Hence all the spitting

BETHANY
Sounds reasonable
METATRON
Maybe to you but Im a lush by nature
BETHANY

I mean about the angel of Deaths resignation

METATRON
For a liberal yes but this is the Angel of Death were talking
about The

Angel of Death cant be a conscientious objector The Angel of Death
is

charged with meting out whatever justice God demands So for their
insolence God decreed that neither Loki nor Bartleby would ever be
allowed

back into Paradise

BETHANY
Were they sent to Hell
METATRON

Worse Wisconsin For the entire span of human history And when the
world
ends theyll sit outside the gates for eternity

BETHANY

And whats this have to do with me

METATRON

Somebodys clued them in to a loophole in Catholic dogma that would
allow
them to reenter Heaven

BETHANY

So what They beat the system Good for them
METATRON

Its not that simple If they get in they will have reversed Gods
decree
Now listen up because this part is very important existence in all
its
form and splendor functions solely on one principle God is
infallible To

prove God wrong would undo reality and everything that is Up would
become
down black would become white existence would become nothingness In
essence - if they are allowed to enter that church theyll unmake the
world

BETHANY

Are these guys that bitter

METATRON
No thats the stupid part they have no idea what their actions will
result in As far as they know theyre just going home Isnt that
sweet

BETHANY

If this is so major why are you talking to me Why doesnt God do
something

METATRON

He could He could blink them out of existence destroy that church
turn

them into plants But Hed rather see you take care of this one
personally

BETHANY
Why me
METATRON
Because of who you are
BETHANY
And who am I
METATRON

The girl in the pjs Dont ask so many questions just serve your
purpose

BETHANY
Ill pass
METATRON
I beg your pardon
BETHANY

When some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus -where was God
When

my

husband decided he couldnt be with a wife that couldnt bear his
children
- where was
God Now all the sudden after all these years of quiet noninvolvement
in
my life He

sends one of His lackeys my way who tells me I should save the world
and
as what -

some sort of test To Hell with Him
METATRON

Do yourself a favor Bethany - do the world a favor let go of your
petty

crap Its served you precious little in the past and it serves you
even

less now when the fate of existence

hangs in the balance Dont allow eons of history and life to get
blinked
out of being just because you have a grudge against your creator

BETHANY

A grudge Do you know why I work in that clinic Its my own private
way of
saying

fuck you to God
METATRON

And any other day Id say thats your business and your life and
enjoy

yourself and goodnight But this isnt about you - this is about
evebody

So you lost the abiliry to make life Youre being offered the chance
to

play mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it - saving
it

(swigs her drink and spits it out)

But I cant make you Youll do what you will However if you should
decide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility you wont
be

alone Youll have support

BETHANY

What more angels
NIETATRON

Prophets - although they dont quite get it yet Youll know them
right

away - one speaks the other listens The one who speaks - and he
at

great lengths whether you want him to or not - will make mention
himself as a prophet The other one wont say anything but hell
helpful

just the same

(looks at watch)

will

of
be

I have to go Youll do what you will but try to remember that were

working in a time frame here

Metatron moves to exit

BETHANY
(beat)
Hey
(Metatron turns)
You work for God
METATRON

They tell me its God If its not Im going to be severely pissed -

h
wien all these years of bossing people around on his behalf and
expectorating perfectly good tequila

BETHANY
Whats he like God

METATRON

(thinks)
Lonely But funny Hes got a great sense of humor

BETHANY
Ill bet

METATRON
Look at sex Sex is funny One time I asked him why you people had to
look
so stupid while procreating He said if you didnt youd do it all
the
time just for fun
BETHANY

But we do

METATRON

I know And you all look so damn stupid doing it It kills us
upstairs

BETHANY
Sex is a joke in Heaven
METATRON
The way I understand it its mostly a joke down here too
And with that Nietatron is gone Bethany looks at her drink A three-
man

mariachi band surround her and begin playing Princes Little Red
Corvette’

INT BETHANYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bethany startles awake The radio on her night-table plays Little Red
Corvette She lays back down

INT BETHANYS OFFICE - DAY

Bethany sits at her desk staring into space A twenty-something girl
speaks butBethanys not really listening Shes extremely
preoccupied

INT CLINIC - NIGHT

Bethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms She packs up her
bag and

turns on the alarm

EXT CLINIC - NIGHT

Bethany exits and locks the door behind her She starts walking

As her feet tread lightly toward her car three small shadows move

toward
her
Bethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse
for

her keys She hears something and stops Roller blades can be heard
moving

slowly across the asphalt of the parking lot Bethany turns quickly

Nobodys there She looks around a bit peturbed
BETHANY
(calling into the darkness)

God what time do you people quit and go home Lets just save it for
tomorrow alright

Theres no response Then theres the noise of wood being tapped
against
the ground Bethany peers into the darkness looking for the source

Suddenly a skater whips past her slamming his stick into the back of
her

knee Bethany goes down Another skater whips in and slashes at her
but

she ducks The stick hits the car door above her She rifles through
her

purse madly until another skater whips by dragging her purse away
with his

stick Bethany looks up

The Stygian Triplets are lined up menacingly a few feet from her
They tap

their hockey sticks in unison on the ground Bethany jumps up and
faces

them defensively The Triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at
her

And from out of nowhere a large figure swoops down from above
landing on

the ground between Bethany and her menacers The Triplets stop short
and

regard the figure curiously The large figure whips into a defensive
stance Batman-style

The Stygian Triplets look to one another They shrug and charge anew

From behind the rock-still large figure a smaller figure leaps into
the

streetlight shrieking flying through the air busting into a flying
kick

He lands before the middle Triplet and open-palm punches him twice in
the
face grabbing his stick from the falling childs hand and tossing it
into
the air behind him

The stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of
the
large figure who twirls it under his arm and then back Out like a
sai He
swings it out before him knocking the other two Triplets off balance
The
smaller figure back flips into the larger figures arms and kicks his
feet
into the faces of the two wobbling Triplets They go down and the
smaller
figure leaps forward with a shriek landing between the fallen pair
elbows

into their backs

The flrst struck Triplet leaps out of the darkness at the large
figure

screaming something unholy The large figure catches the kid by the
throat

and quickly

head butts him tossing him to the side The large figure sways for a
beat

and then shakes it off

The small figure collects the hockey sticks and throws them into the
distance He kicks at the falien Triplets as they scurry away

SMALL FIGURE
(calling after them)
GO BACK TO YOUR PAPER ROUTES YOU PUNK FUCKS
(more to himself)
Snoogans

The large figure saddles up beside the small figure They look at one
another and shake hands

SMALL FIGURE
Dude I know they were just kids but we kicked their fucking asses
Bethany stares mystified She grabs her purse from the ground

BETHANY
Where where did you learn to do that stuff
SMALL FIGURE
From this comic book some guys made about us Long story
BETHANY
(beat)
I dont know what to say or think
The figures turn into the light revealing the faces of the heroes for
the
first time - two very familiar faces
SMALL FIGURE
Say youll offer us sex as a reward
BETHANY
Who are you
The large figure lights up a smoke The small one extends his hand

SMALL FIGURE

JAY

BETHANY

(a bit stunned)
Excuse me

JAY

We figure an abortion clinic is a good place to meet loose women Why

BETHANY
(taken aback)
Oh Right Well I should be going Thanks for the rescue I think
JAY

(shocked)
Wait wait wait - we just saved your ass and youre just going to
take

BETHANY
I had a weird night last night and now tonights not shaping up to be
any
better I think I should go home take some percosets and lay down
(opens her car door)

JAY

(to Silent Bob)
How about that shit Fuck this town man - Im going back to Jersey
and

(they start walking)

At least there I can get turned down while trying to make myself a
profit

Bethany freezes Metatrons words echo in her ear She shakes her
head

BETHANY
(to herself)
Youve gotta be kidding me
(thinks for a beat then) Hey Wait

She runs up to them They whip around and raise their fists
defensively

BETHANY
Sorry
(beat)
Would you I cant believe Im doing this
(inhales deeply)
Would you like to have a drink with me

Jays face lights up He punches Silent Bob in the arm
JAY
See I told you if we hung around outside that place wed get laid
Thank

Thank you God
INT SEEDY GUN SHOP - NIGHT

Various guns are laid out atop a glass case

OC SALESMAN
Now this piece is nice Its not lightweight but one look at it and
nobody

Loki picks up the gun Bartleby and the SALESMAN look at him
LOKI

BARTLEBY
ts the weapon of choice these days

LOKI

t seems unimpressive At least the sword looked intimidating How can

strike fear into the hearts of the wicked with this
SALESMAN

Oh I get it You want to become a vigilante right Like Batman or
something

LOKI
Batman never uses guns
(off gun)
I dont know It feels impersonal
BARTLEBY

Then dont use a gun Just lay the place to waste like Sodom and
Gommorah
Now that was something

LOKI

Oh yeah for you maybe You got to stand there and read I had to do
all
the work

BARTLEBY

What work You lit a few fires

LOKI
I rained down sulfur man Theres a subtle difference

BARTLEBY

Sure

LOKI

Are you kidding me Any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire
Raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance Mass genocide is
the

most exhausting activity one can engage in next to soccer

(to Salesman)

Ill take this one

SALESMAN
Five seventy five to walk with it right now
Loki starts sifting through his wallet

In that highly unlikely situation
(beat)

JAY

(to Silent Bob)
What do you think
Silent Bob shrugs Jay stands up
JAY

Alright But Ill drive
EXT MAIN HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Bethanys car roars overhead speeding down the road reving awfully
loudly

INT BETHANYS CAR - NIGHT
The speedometer reads ninety five
Jay drives eyes glued to the road happy as hell Silent Bob smokes
to his
right Bethany sits pinned against the back seat wearing an
uncomfortable
and dubious look She struggles to lean forward The engine still
races

BETHANY
(yelling over engine noise)
What gear are you in

JAY

(not looking back)
Gear

EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Jay Silent Bob and Bethany sit on and against the car The hood is
open
and smoke billows out
JAY
(defensively)
Well what do I know from shifting Like I ever drove before
Silent Bob shrugs and smokes Bethany walks away shaking her head
JAY

Silent Bob nods and extracts a tool from his jacket He begins working
on
the engine as a crossountry bus races by
INT BUS - NIGHT
Bartleby and Loki sit in the back Bartleby reads a map and Loki
stares at

the gun in his lap A COUPLE makes out in the seat in front of them

BARTLEBY
We have to pass through three more states to get to New Jersey
Indianna
Ohio and Pennsylvania
LOKI
With a very important stop in Cleveland
BARTLEBY
Oh right The Angel of Death Returns Sounds like a bad movie
LOKI
Movies are bullshit And dont start with me airight The last time
you
bugged me about my job you got us sentenced to life in Wisconsin

(looks out window)

All this time weve been down here why didnt we ever leave the
Cheese

BARTLEBY
He said to stay where he put us We feared worse punishment if we
disobeyed
Him again

LOKI
Where were we afraid Hed send us
BARTLEBY
New Jersey
LOKI
Now that my friend is irony
BARTLEBY

(beat)
You know maybe youre wrong about this slaughter How can you even be
sure
of what incurs the Lords wrath these days Times change Remember
when
eating meat on Friday was supposed to be a Hellworthy tresspass Or
when
people werent even supposed to shop on Sundays
LOKI

That stuff was small potatoes The major sins never change And
believe me
- I can spot a commandment breaker a mile away

BARTLEBY
Sure

LOKI

You dont believe me
(looks around eyes fall on kissing couple)
There Theres one

BARTLEBY
(off couple)

So what Theyre kissing
LOKI
Adultery
BARTLEBY
Thats a stretch How do you know theyre not dating
LOKI
Youd know better than me - lets hear it
BARTLEBY

Oh I know the truth But lets see how boned up on the job you really
are

LOKI
A test
BARTLEBY
Of sorts So whats your proof
LOKI
Hes wearing a wedding band
BARTLEBY
So Maybe thats his wife
LOKI

No married man kisses his wife like that You get married and the
passion
dies man Dont you ever watch talk shows

BARTLEBY
What are you talking about
LOKI

A guy makes his best plays when wooing When the object of his desire
is

won theres no need to expend the effort anymore He relaxes
satisfied

with the spoils of victory which he then decides isnt so victorious
because hes saddled with a life-mate
BARTLEBY
Very romantic sentiment
LOKI

Thats the problem - romance You think about it back in the old
days

nobody got married out of quote unquote love People married for
property dowries or to procreate - to immortalize oneself through
offspring When did all this love stuff start What the hell happened
to

the status quo

BARTLEBY
The Troubadors
LOKI
Lionel Richies old group
BARTLEBY

No thats the Commodores The Troubadors were wandering minstrels and
dramatists that sang melodramatic and sappy songs of undying love

LOKI
Sounds like the Commodores
BARTLEBY

The Troubadors made love fashionable And their influence altered
the

balance in a significant fashion Until them people got married
because

they had to After them people started falling in love Romantic
courtships became the norm What started out as simple entertainment
made

such a dramatic impact as to forever alter the way society operates

LOKI

Thats human beings for you - easily misled From the Garden of Eden
to the

Thigh Master - thev believe what theyre told Im telling you - one
day

theyre all going to watch one too many John Hughes flicks and start
looking for Shermer Illinois

BARTLEBY
Be fair Humans are dumb but not that dumb
(off couple)
So is it adultery or not

LOKI
(thinks to couple)
Excuse me

The Couple stops kissing The MAN looks at Loki

LOKI
Are you married

MAN
(puzzled)
Why

LOKI
Just curious

MAN

(holds up ring finger)
What do you think
The Man shakes his head and goes back to kissing Bartleby offers Loki

a
Satisfled expression Loki taps the Man on the shoulder

MAN
(breaks kiss pissed)
What

LOKI
To her

MAN

What
LOKI
Are you married to her
MAN
Not that its any of your fucking business but no Why
Loki looks at Bartleby Bartleby rolls his eyes Loki calmly shoots
the man
in the head Screaming ensues
EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
The bus skids to a halt People flock off in a panic scattering
After a
beat Bartleby and Loki deboard and stand there alone
BARTLEBY
Youre such an asshole
LOKI
Dont blame me man Blame the Commodores
BARTLEBY
Troubadors

EXT ROADSIDE OF HIGHWAY - DAWN

Silent Bob still tools around under the hood Jay hands him various

Nobody is fucking me You got that

JAY
Youre breaking up with us

BETHANY

Good luck with finding Molly Ringwald or whoever it is voure looking

Sorry for the inconvenience Good bye

Bethany starts walking away Jay stares at her shocked
JAY
(to Bethany)
Who the hell do you think you are lady You cant go around breaking
peoples hearts like that We fell in love with you Guys like us

dont
just fall out of the sky you know

On cue a naked black MAN falls from the sky landing between the two
parties Bethany and Jay stare at him The Man is face down sooty
and

ashen - as if hes just been in a fire Bethany drops to her knees and
rolls him over feeling for a pulse Jay looks down then looks
skyward as

Silent Bob joins him

JAY
(yelling up)
A beautiful naked woman doesnt just fall from the sky you know

(beat to Silent Bob)
Was worth a try
Silent Bob nods Bethany presses her ear to the mans chest
BETHANY
No heartbeat
JAY

Do you think he fell from a plane Like Alive Did you ever see that
flick

BETHANY
(starts CPRing him)

I think there would have been more of a mess if he fell from that
high

Not necessarily

Bethany Jay and Silent Bob leap back The man sits up and rubs his
face

JAY
KILL IT KILL IT

MAN
That sounds familiar

BETHANY

Jesus are you okay

MAN

JAY

Hes the fuckin undead Cut his head off

What happened to your car You clock ninety in first gear or

RUFUS
(to Jay)
Listen goldie-locks what I just did was not easy and it gae me a
fucking
migraine Now if you dont pipe down Im going to rip your balls off
JAY
(hiding behind Silent Bob)
I knew it Mother fucker wants to eat my brain
BETHANY
I think he was aiming a bit further south

(to Rufus)

Speaking of which youre awfully nude - Rufus is it

RUFUS
Rufus it is Miss
(to Silent Bob)
Hey tubby hows about lending a brother your coat till I can find
my
own threads
Jay looks at Silent Bob

JAY

Dude he fell out of thin air
Silent Bob shrugs and passes his coat to Rufus Jay bugs
JAY
Dude his dick is gonna be rubbing all over the inside of your armor

RUFUS
(to Silent Bob)
Ill do my best to tuck it back brother

Silent Bob nods Something OC catches his eye He stares OC and exits

BETHANY
Where exactly did you fall from
RUFUS
Some might say grace
JAY

(to Silent Bob)
Dude hes talking about your mom
Jay turns to see that Silent Bob isnt there

Silent Bob peers at a large bush at the road side The bush rustles
slightly

Oc BETHANY

You know normally Id have a hard time with this but somehow you
falling

out of the sky seems to go hand in glove with some of the other stuff
Ive

been deaiing with

OC RUFUS
Believe me - you aint seen nothing yet
Silent Bob peers closer at the bush Suddenly - a Stygian Triplet
leaps out
at him pinning him to the ground with his hockey stick
The other two Triplets leap on top of Jay and BETHANY
Rufus grabs the one off Bethany and hurls him to the side
Jay manages to reach into his jacket and pull out a copy of Penthouse
He

rolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it

Silent Bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it
up
hard into the Triplets forhead knocking him off He rushes to Jays
side
and plies the other Triplet from his throat hurling him OC

The Triplet Silent Bob fought punctures the air with his stick and
rips
downward creating a hole He grabs his friend and leaps into it
disappearing

Jay and Silent Bob look at eachother blink and embrace passionately

The Triplet that Rufus threw rushes Rufus from behind - hockey stick

in

lancing position Without looking back Rufus reaches behind himself

grabbing the stick and swinging it (and the Triplet) over his head in

an

arch letting go The last Triplet goes sailing through the hole

and it

seals shut

Bethany Jay and Silent Bob are in various wide-eyed states of shock
JAY

Alright - whats with you lady Thats the second time you got

attacked

by the fucking Mighty Ducks
RUFUS

(wiping off hands)

Man theyre onto you bad already I got here just in time
BETHANY

How can you be so composed We were almost killed

RUFUS

Death is a worry of the living The dead only worry about decay and
necrophiliacs

JAY
See I told you he was the undead
RU FUS

Not the undead the dead I died Christ told me the secret to
resurrection
once when we were at a wedding in Canna but I got drunk and forgot
it

BETHANY
(incredulous)

Wait wait wait - Christ You knew Christ

RUFUS
Knew him I saw him naked

BETHANY
Let me guess - youre another angel

RUFUS

No Im aman - just like you and him

(looks at Jay)

Well maybe not like him At least I was a man Been dead for nearly
two

thousand years Here

(pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear)

JAY

No wonder he saw Jesus - homeys rockin the ganj

BETHANY
(unrollingit)
Its not a joint
(looks at it)
I cant read this
RUFUS
Its Sanskiit It says Rufus - see you in two years Jesus Freaked

me
out because he basically told me when my number was up Took the
flavor out

of the remaining years Look we gotta keep moving If we stay in one
place
long enough those things are liable to come back What say we
continue
this discussion over something to eat

BETHANY
(snaps)
WAIT A SECOND
(inhales deeply)
m a rational woman okay All I want to know is where you and
those
ids came from
RUFUS

They came from Hell I came from Heaven

(walking away)

Lets start walking
JAY
Walk Do you know how far we are from anywhere
RUFUS
Back in the old days with JC we walked everywhere Did you ever
hear of
a fat apostle
(exits)
Bethany looks to Jay and Silent Bob for some guidance or stability

JAY

Whats an apostle

Bethany shakes her head and exits Jay and Silent Bob shrug at each
other

Hello No theyre not in right now Im the phone guy Ill

The Stygian Triplets nod

us further The best course of action is to insure that our parcel is

found And being that I cant even trust you enough to kill a girl
Im

left with no choice but to seek outside assistance in guarding our
package

(sighs)
Im going to have to summon the Golgothan
The Figure exits The Stygian Triplets register shock

EXT FAST FOOD JOINT - DAWN
Rufus - now wearing some funky new clothes - carries a tray of fast

food to

an outdoor table Sitting already are Bethany Jay and Silent Bob
RUFUS

(off new clothes)

Its amazing the shit people throw out Didnt I tell you Id find

some

threads

A car full of teens whip past them

TEEN
(yelling from passing car)
GARBAGE PICKER

RUFUS
(waves to them)
Thank you
(to group)
Whats that mean

JAY

It means they saw you pull that shit out of that dumpster
RUFUS

So its a good thing then

(handing coat back to Silent Bob)

I appreciate the loan brother You can have this back

JAY

(to Silent Bob)

Lucky you
RUFUS

(off food)
Damn I remember when all we used to have for breakfast was fish and

goats

milk What do you call this shit
BETHANY

(to Rufus)

Egg McMuffin Now how about you start explaining some things to me
RUFUS

Like what

BETHANY

Like - for starters - who the hell are those kids that keep attacking
me

RUFUS

Nasty little bastards called the Stygian Triplets Theyre not really
related When they were alive they were a trio of kids that snatched a
neighbors toddler and smashed its skull in - just to see what it
looked

like I believe was their defense They were killed in a car wreck on
the

way to a detention center

BETHANY

So theyre dead too
RUFUS

Youd be surprised how many dead people are just walking around -
were

stubborn bastards Thing is those kids are supposed to be in Hell
Which

means that someone wants you out of the picture so badly theyre
willing to

summon demons

BETHANY
Is it those two angels Im supposed to stop
RUFUS
Couldnt be Theyre not evil - theyre just stupid

JAY
(to Bethany)

Wait a minute - are you going to listen to this shit We dont even
know

who this guy is For all you know hes in with those fucks They both
showed up at the same time

BETHANY

I hate to say it - but he does have a point How did you know where to
find
us

RUFUS
You know what the dead do with most of their time They watch the

living
Especially in the shower

JAY
(to Silent Bob)
I cant wait to die
BETHANY
And why are you watching me
RUFUS

Because youre the one whos going to help me get some changes made in
that
book you all hold so much stock in

JAY
Hustler
RUFUS
The Bible
BETHANY
Whats your beef with the Bible
RUFUS

Im not in it
JAY
Neither are any of us but you dont hear us bitching
RUFUS
But Im supposed to be in it I was the Thirteenth Apostle
BETHANY

Ive been going to church my entire life and Ive never heard of a
thirteenth apostle named Rufus

RUFUS

See You know all about the other twelve Apostles -white boys I might
add

But no mention of Rufus And why Cause Im a black man But thats
just my

pet peeve I mainly want to correct a major error that you people are
basing a faith on

BETHANY
Whats that

RUFUS
Jesus wasnt white He was black

Rufus bites into his sandwhich Bethany Jay and Silent Bob look at
him and
then each other

JAY

Bullshit Ive seen pictures of Jesus and He has blonde hair and blue
eyes

RUFUS
(wiping hands)

Thats whats particularly insulting Between the time when He
established

the faith and the church started to officially organize the powers-
that-be

decided that while the message of Christ was integral the fact that
He was

black was a detriment So all renderings were ordered to be
Eurocentric

even though the brother was blacker than Jesse
BETHANY

If thats true then whyd He get written about while you were left
out

RUFUS

Well He is the Son of God right Its kind of hard to have the New
Testament without him So you fudge a few facts and put a spin on His
ethnicity Leaving me outs okay because theres still Twelve apostles
to

choose from

JAY
I dont buy it
RUFUS

Thats what the good people of Antioch were saying when they stoned my
ass

BETHANY

You were martyred
RUFUS

Thats one way of putting it Another way is to say I was bludgeoned
to

shit by big rocks See - Christ told us Apostles to go out into the
world

and spread His word Antioch was already garnering a big Christian
following so I got sent there And was a big hit They loved hearing
about

Jesus message and how He was the Redeemer But when I mentioned He
was

black the whole town turned on me - called me a liar and shit I
pressed

the point and before I know it Im wearing stones - although not to
accessonze

BETH ANY

Why didnt you just let the point go when you saw how they were
reacting

RUFUS

Because its part of the facts White folks only want to hear the good
shit life eternal a place in Gods kingdom As soon as they hear
theyre

getting all this from a black Jesus they freak And that - my friends
- is

called Hypocrisy Folks just cant accept a black Savior

(to Silent Bob)
You going to eat that hash brown

BETHANY

So you went to Heaven
RUFUS

Shit yeah it was the least the brother could do I gave up my sheep
and

followed His ass around Jerusalem for three years And in all that
time

did I ever get laid Hell no But I didnt bitch because I was into
His

message And while the message is what counts folks should know that
He

was black Thats why Im going to help you find stop those angels
from

getting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my
campaign

BETHANY
How do you know about that
RUFUS
Heavens a pretty boring place and anything that breaks the tedium is
news The unmaking of existence is what you might consider a great
tediumbreaker Besides there isnt much I dont know about you
BETHANY
I find that hard to believe
RUFUS
When you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand
JAY
(shocked)

You did that
BETHANY

Yeah but I never told anyone about it
RUFUS

Neither did he He died of Leukemia two years later His name was

BETHANY
BryanJohnson
RUFUS
Your exploits - no matter how inane - are well-known in Heaven
Probably in
Hell too

Bethany rubs her temples and exits OC Rufus watches her go
JAY
(intrigued)
Tell me something about me
RUFUS
(preoccupied with the OC Bethany)
You masturbate more than anybody else on the planet
JAY
Shit everyone knows that Tell me something nobody knows
RUFUS
You think about guys when you do it
Rufus gets up and exits Silent Bob looks at Jay shocked
JAY
Not all the time
Bethany sits on a swing in the kiddie-jungle gym shaking her head
Rufus
joins her

RUFUS
Im sorty if I spooked you
BETHANY

I just feel violated Like my life isnt mine exclusively
RUFUS

Thats the way it goes with celebrities
BETHANY

What are you talking about Im a nobody Im just a quiet girl from
the
suburbs who counsels pregnant teens

RUFUS

You sound like Christ He had the same reaction when He found out who
He

was minus the quiet girl from the burbs angle And like Him Im
sure

youll come to terms and do what youre supposed to

BETHANY
Why not get the pope or someone holy like that

RUFUS
Just because a guy wears a funny hat doesnt make him the right man
for
the job Only certain hands can deliver the world from the brink of
destruction last time it was Jesus - this time its you

BETHANY
Why me

RUFUS
Cant say yet But the question is - are your hands capable enough to
carry
the burden It all rides on you

BFTRANY

(rubbing her temples)

Two thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home You know
yesterday I wasnt sure God even existed And now Im upto my ass in
Christian Mythology
RUFUS
God hates it when its referred to as Mythology

BFTHANY

Well then lets ask the quote unquote prophets what we should call
it
instead

(looking OC concerned)
Now where did those two assholes go
INT STRIP JOINT

Its your typical strip club One woman on a stage and a crowd of men
paying way-too-much attention The place is dimly lit with red lights
and

chock full of smoke Off to one side a dee-jay spins records
blasting the

music The crowd is rather thin

Jay and Silent Bob sit at the stage their eyes glued on

The DANCER - a gorgeous shapely vixen with very little clothing on
and
growing littler by the second

Jay pokes Silent Bob who produces a wad of bills They skim off a
nice

pile and stow the rest They spread their piles neatly on the bar The
Dancer smiles and starts dancing toward them Jay holds up a five-spot
and

performs his own little seductive dance th it He stands at the edge
of

the stage rating The Dancer slinks over and Jay stuffs the five in
her

G-string She rubs his head and slinks away Jay humps Silent Bobs
chair

excitedly Bethany and Rufus come up from behind them Bethany hits
Jay

BETHANY
(shouting above the music)
What are you doing

JAY
Proving to this bastard that I aint gay
BETHANY
What
RUFUS
Long story - forget it But we should get moving How can we get to
New
Jersey
BETHANY

I had a car

She slaps Jay upside the head but - riveted by the Dancer - he
doesnt

feel it

BETHANY
(to Rufus)
We could go by train

RUFUS
(looking OC)
Sounds cool

BETHANY

Theres a phone out there Ill call for reservations
Rufus is now also riveted by a table dancer off to the side
BETHANY
No its okay I can handle it
Rufus half-nods Bethany shakes her head and exits
The Dancer gyrates on the stage revealing more and more of herself
Jay pounds on the stage hoots and dances flashing more bills
ACROSS THE STAGE a small GANG of bandanna-wearing angry-looking

blacks
watch the OC Jay with little amusement The Dancer dances toward them
JAY
(banging on stage)
Sweet thing
(Hashes another five)
Look what I found Snoog

The Dancer smiles as she approaches Jay but is interrupted by more
banging

The GANG LEADER has his foot on the stage He produces a ten dollar
bill

from his jacket and casually holds it up The other three members of
his

posse smile and slap hands

The Dancer shrugs at the shocked Jay and changes direction heading
toward

the Gang Jay casts a horrified look at Silent Bob

The Gang Leader leans forward preparing to tip when we hear an
obnoxiously

loud throatlearing

Jay holds aloft a twenty smiling and nodding
The Dancer shrugs at the Gang Leader and again switches direction The
Gang

Leader looks at his posse who shake their heads at him
disappointedly

The Stage becomes a bidding table as - on one side - the Gang Leader
produces two twenties On the other side jay - staring at the Gang
Leader

- produces three twenties The Gang Leader hits his posse up for more
cash

Jay hits Silent Bob up for more cash The Dancer stays in the middle
gyrating and sizing up the best offer

Jay then produces the cremede Ia creme three hundred dollar bills
He

sneers at the OC Gang Leader The Dancer heads over to jay and wraps
her

legs around him from the stage gyrating against his groin Jay stares
at

the Gang Leader a victorious smirk on his face

The Gang Leader shakes his head angrily and jumps out of his seat
producing a gun from his jacket He fires into the ceiling The music
scratches to a halt and the other viewers scatter toward the door The
Gang
Leader points his piece at Jay his posse backing him up

GANG LEADER

You a smart ass aintcha white boy Come in here and ruin my good
time

JAY

Its a free country The bitch just came to the man with the most
DANCER

Bitch

JAY
No offense baby

GANG LEADER

The bitch is gonna be leaving with the man with the most - the man
with the
most led in his piece While you and tubby are leaving with the most
led in
your dead fucking carcasses know what Im sayin

JAY
(to Dancer)
Step to the side baby Ive gotta slap this pussyass Nino Brown
wanna-be
down

DANCER
(to Gang Leader)
Come on Kane This isnt necessary
GANG LEADER

Shut the fuck up and back away from the midget

The Dancer moves to the side

GANG LEADER
(to Jay)

Now I believe you were about to apologize I believe you were about to
intone some pleas for mercy You were about to say Please Mister
Kane I

didnt mean to disrespect you in your club Please accept my most
humble

apology
Bethany comes back and sees the mess She moves to rush to Jays side
but
Rufus holds her back An OC Jay laughs
Jay leans on Silent Bob laughing The Gang stares back angrily
JAY
You want an apology
GANG LEADER
(cocks gun)
Give me at least one Im sorry and 1tll put a kill shot through
that
thick fucking skull of yours Otherwise we go slow and long in the
pain
dispensation
JAY
(beat zips jacket closed)
Know what Im doing
GANG LEADER
No What you doing

JAY

Im closing my jacket so that when we start this up I dont get your
filthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt You know why

GANG LEADER
Why
JAY

Because you cant get shit stains out of flannel What Im saying is
that
you got shit for brains
The Gang Leader and his posse stare silently for a moment
GANG LEADER

Well I appreciate you breaking that down for me but I got it without
the
explanation

JAY

No No I dont think you did get it See theres gonna he some
nines

firing in here and when the bullets stop flyin your cunt-lip ass is
gonna be all holes and smoke You think you can draw on me and walk
away

Fuck that And fuck you - you punk-ass monkey bitch Yeah I called
you a

monkey Maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before I cap you Ill
bring a

coconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave stick a straw
through it

and stick the other end in the ground Your lipsll reach

The Gang stares mystified Rufus and Bethany cant move theyre so
frightened

JAY

You think every white boy cowers at your ass Shit if I dont fucking
plant you - watermelon - my muscle here will

(thumbs at Silent Bob)

What do you think he is My boy friend I love chicks So hes gotta
be

with me for one reason to watch my back Silent Bob doesnt talk in
words

- he speaks in bullets Res all quiet cause hes thinking about how
hes

gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the
bullets in

your bodies before they cool down You know why Because he likes to
see

the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down Come to think
of

it Im tired of talking to your dumb ass you probably dont even
understand big words like piss Tell you what - Ill let him explain
it

to you

(to Silent Bob)
Silent Bob - shoot these punk-monkey bitches

Silent Bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion Jay looks
at

him

JAY
What are you waiting for
Silent Bob shrugs

JAY
(flabbergasted)
YOU DONT RAVE A GUN
Silent Bob kind of nods

JAY

(shocked)
WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN ALL THIS TIME WEVE BEEN TOGETHER AND YOU
DONT
HAVE A GUN
Silent Bob indicates the negative sheepishly
JAY
THATS JUST FUCKING GREAT DO YOU THINK I
WOULDVE SAID ALL THAT IF ID KNOWN YOU
DIDNT HAVE A GUN
(beat)

HUNHH

Silent Bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully The Gang snickers and
smiles

GANG LEADER
What was that about a coconut

Jay shakes his head and glowers at Silent Bob
JAY
No gun What the fuck kind of muscle are you All this time and you
got no
gun
GANG LEADER
Oh boys We have some unfinished business here
JAY
(sheepishly)
Can we talk this over

GANG LEADER

Tell you what - you got thirty seconds Then I cap you Talk all you
like

Bethany goes to make a move but Rufus holds her back shaking his
head He
puts a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the
action
smiling
Jay fumes
JAY
(to Silent Bob)
I cant believe you
(to Gang Leader)
Do me a favor
(points to Silent Bob)
Shoot this piece of shit first
(to Silent Bob disgusted)
No gun
Suddenly they both snap into a momentary trance Zombie-like Jay and
Silent Bob step to the turntables behind them Jay puts on headphones

and
begins scratching a record A familiar tune begins
The Gang watches perplexed
Silent Bob whips around microphone in his hand and begins to sing
SILENT BOB
HEY HEY HEY ITS FAT ALBERT
AND IM GONNA SING A SONG FOR YOU
AND BILLS GONNA TELL YOU A THING OR TWO
WELL HAVE SOME FUN NOW
WITH BILL AND ALL THE GANG
LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER -
WHILE WE DO OUR THANG
The Gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment The Gang Leader
softens
and smiles adding a slight nod of approval Jay provides back-up
JAY
NA NA NA GON NA HAVE A GOOD TIME
SILENT BOB
(as Fat Albert)
HEY HEY HEY
JAY

NA NA NA GONNA HAVE A GOOD TIME

Bethany and Rufus look on amazed

RUFUS
I thought she looked familiar

BETHANY
Who

RUFUS

(he nods toward the stage)
Serendipity
Bethany looks to the stage

The Dancer is the SERENDIPITY in question She wipes sweat from her
brow

INT MOOBY CORP BOARDROOM - DAY

Oh this isnt your standard boardroom this is Mooby Corp home of
Mooby

the Golden Calf - which can only be described as a bovine variation on
Barney sickeningly simple and very non-threatening A large table
sits in

the middle a media center behind the huge chair at the head The
walls are

adorned with framed posters of Mooby playing with kids mouth agape
ina

stupid smile At the center of the table is a large gold plated
statue of

the insipid creature

Doors open and the boardroom fills with suits - six men one woman
They
chatter and take their seats After a beat WHITLAND the CEO enters
taking his place at the head of the conference table
WHITLAND
Good morning shoppers
(slaps a file on table)
Has anyone seen the over-nights
An anticipatory hush fills the room
WHITLAND

We creamed

em

A cheer and applause goes up from the group Whitland smiles
WHITLAND

(reading from file)

And last night was a rerun which says to me that with the six months

we

have to ready and promote the Very Nlooby Christmas pay-per-view
special
we can produce history-making numbers The record is held by that
shock-jocks New Years thing but I see no reason why our little cash
cow
cant supercede those numbers and
(stops and sniffs the air)
Do I smell onions
Bartleby and Loki sit behind the thrall on a black leather couch Loki
is
carving something out of an onion while Bartleby looks on
Whitland and the rest of the board stare at them
WHITLAND

I didnt realize we had guests Who are these gentlemen with

The other suits shrug and look to one another for an answer nobody
has

WHITLAND
(to Bartleby and Loki)
Excuse me
Loki continues carving Bartleby looks at his friend and shakes his
head
Loki lifts his head without looking up
LOKI
(very distracted)
Hmm
WHITLAND
May I ask what youre doing in my boardroom
LOKI
(still preoccupied)
My friend just has a few words for you and then well be on our way
Heading to Jersey you see Now -by the decor I assume Im guessing
correctly that this is the corporate headquarters for Mooby

Productions
International
WHITLAND
You guess correctly Now may I ask who the fuck you are and - again -
what
the fuck youre doing in our conference room

LOKI

(to Bartleby still not looking up)
You may proceed mon ami

BARTLEBY
I cant believe you
(to Whitland)
I just want to start off by apologizing My friend here has a penchant
toward the dramatic so hes making me do this Usually I dont even

involve myself in his affairs but he hasnt done this in awhile so
he

wants
LOKI
(frustrated)
Just read em their rights already
BARTLEBY

(sighs circling the table)

Mooby the Golden Calf Created by Nancy Goidruff -a former
kindergarten

teacher - in nineteen eighty nine to fill a gap in the Saturday
morning

schedule on local network K-REL Bought by the Complex Corporation in
nineteen ninety one and broadcast nationally as the The Mooby Fun-
Time

Hour it picked up a large following of children ages three to
eight and

spawns sixteen records two theatrical films eight prime-time
specials a

library of priced-to-own video cassettes and bicoastal theme parks
dubbed

MoobyWorld

(beat)

Did I miss anything
Whitland and company stare for a beat
WHITLAND
You forgot Mooby Magazine Is there a point to this
BARTLEBY
(grimly)
You and your board are idolators
Whitland and company stare dumbfounded Loki finishes carving and
stands
beside Bartleby
LOKI
(to Bartleby)

How could your forget the magazine

Bartleby rolls his eyes Loki turns to the Whitland and holds up the
sculpture

LOKI

Its you
(sets sculpture on table)
Do you know much about voo-doo Fascinating practice very close to
Satanism but not really much of a religion - no doctrine of faith
Just an
arrangements of superstitions the most well- known of which is the
voo-doo
doll
(sneezes waits continues)
A mock-up of an individual is subjected to various pokes and prods
and the
desired result is that the individual will feel the effects

WHITLAND
(to nearest board member)

Call security - now

Loki throws the knife at the table severing the phone cord
LOKI

All lines are currently down

BARTLEBY
(to Whitland)
Again - I apologize for my friends
LOKI
(frustrated)
Would you just get on with it
BARTLEBY

(miffed to Whitland)

You are responsible for raising an icon that draws worship from the
Lord

Youve broken the first commandment but more than that Im afraid
none of

you passes for a decent human being Your continued existence is a
mockery

of morality

(looks to Loki Loki nods)

Like you - Mister Bernard

(stands behind board member)

Last year you cheated on your wife of seventeen years eight times -
twice

with prostitutes You even had sex with her best friend while she was
at

her garden club meeting and you were supposed to be watching your
ids

LOKI

n the bed you and your wife share no less

fq

The board member stares in disbelief Loki nods to Bartleby and he
moves
on

BARTLBY
And you Mister Newman

Loki sifts through compact discs He pulls out one entitled Mooby
Mania

and pops it into a player A simple childrens song echoes through the
room

BARTLEBY

You got your girlfriend drunk at last years Christmas party and then
paid

a kid from the mailroom to have sex with her while she was passed out
just

so you could break up with her - guilt free - when she sobbingly
confessed

the next morning that she cheated on you She killed herself three
months

later You sent flowers to her wake

The board members face is frozen Bartleby shakes his head and moves
quickly around the table

BARTLEBY
(not liking his job)

Mister Pereira disowned his gay son Mister Turran put his mother ina
third-rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her
house to

purchase an oriental rug for himself Mister Barker flew to the
Phillipines

on the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy Mister
Bloom okayed the production of Mooby dolls from what he knew were
unsafe

and toxic materials because it was less costly

Bartleby stops at the female Board member and looks at her relieved
BARTLEBY

You on the other hand are an innocent You lead a good life and have
never misused your power here

She stares at Bartleby Loki pats her on the back and urges Bartleby
on

BARTLEBY

But you Mister Whitland You have more skeletons in your closet than
this
assembled party I cant even mention them aloud
Bartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into Whitlands
ear
Whitland goes green Bartleby steps back Loki stands beside Whitland

LOKI
Youre her father you sick fuck
Whitland begins sobbing
BARTLEBY
(to Loki)
Can I go now
LOKI

(cheerily rubbing his head)
Go on you crazy kid
Bartlebv exits Loki turns menacingly on the others
LOKI
With the exception of Miss Pryce there is not a decent human being
amongst
you Do you know what makes a human being decent
(beat)
Fear And therein lies the problem None of you has anything to fear
anymore You rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power hiding
behind
your false idol far from judgement - lives shrouded in secrecy even
from
one another But not from God
Loki goes to exit but pauses He turns around
LOKI
I forgot my little voo-doo doll
(looks at Whitland)

Wow It really does look just like you Maybe if I believed enough

Loki begins moaning menacingly slowly waving an open palm over the
figure
Whitland looks at it horrified then at Loki then back at the figure
He

sweats and shifts in his seat - eyes pinned on the figure Loki lets
out a

shriek and smashes the figure with his fist Whitland freezes eyes
closed

Slowly he opens his eyes - unharmed

LOKI
I dont believe in voo-doo
Loki swiftly exits The Board Members sit in awed silence Then the
doors
burst open and Loki storms back in

LOKI
But I do believe in this
Gun blazing he takes out the male board members including Whitland
ina
flurry of bullets The remaining female Board Member covers her head
with
her arms Loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair

LOKI
(smiling)
Its okay Youve done nothing wrong They were bad men You are a
pure

soul

She looks at him terrified He smiles back Then his expression
hardens

LOKI
But you didnt say God Bless You when I sneezed
He quickly puts the gun to her head She slams her eyes shut
OC BARTLEBY
(cautionary)
Loki
Loki freezes and looks OC He grimaces and holsters his piece

LOKI
(to woman)
Sorry Force of habit
He surveys his handiwork and exits The female Board Member slowly
opens
her eyes and looks around
INT STRIP JOINT - LATER
Jay and the Gang Leader sit together at a table surrounded by the
other
gangsters and Silent Bob They laugh and chug their 40s
GANG LEADER
(to Gang)
Watch this shit

(to Jay)

Do it again G Do the Mush-mouth

JAY
(swigs his beer as Mush-mouth)
Hey-buh Fat-buh Al-buh-bert
The Gang laughs hysterically
GANGSTER 1

Fat Albert like a mother fucker and shit
Bethany Rufus and Serendipity huddle around a table further away
RUFUS
(elated)
I forgot you were down here How long now
SERENDIPITY

Three years this August What about you - is this another temporary
expulsion You and your Christ was down campaign

BETHANY
What does that mean - another expulsion I thought you came down here
specifically to help me

SERENDIPITY
Is that what he told you Rufus gets thrown out constantly at least

once a
month ethereal time They always bring him back but only after a few

of weace and quiet - free from that black nationalist rhetoric
RUFUS
(joking)
Artsy-fartsy bitch
SERENDIPITY
Who you calling artsy-fartsy
RUFUS

(to Bethany)
Serendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in Jerusalem
BETHANY

Let me guess - the fourteenth apostle left out of the bible because
shes

a woman
RUFUS
The girls not a woman
(to Serendipity)
No offense
BETHANY

Oh those werent tits I saw Jay cozying up to
SERENDIPITY
(tugs on boobs)
What these You should know better than anyone at this table that

tits
dont make a woman
RUFUS
Hell the tubby coat-wearing mother fuckers got tits - dont make
hima
woman
SERENDIPITY
Aside from an intuitive knack for accessorizing what traditionally
defines

a woman falls between two things her legs But as you can see

Serendipity stands and unbuttons her jeans dropping them slightly
revealing yet another smooth sexless crotch quite like Metatrons

SERENDIPITY
I lack definition
oc JAY
Hey Theyre getting a free show

Serendipity pulls her pants back up and sits down smiling at the OC
party

BETHANY
(weary)

Oh God Another angel Like Metatron

SERENDIPITY
How do you know Metatron
(to Rufus)
How does she know Metatron
RUFUS
This is the last Scion
SERENDIPITY

(beat)
Youre kidding

RUFUS
Dont you see the resemblance
SERENDIPITY
(stares at Bethany)
A bit
(suddenly nervous)
Oh shit If shes been tapped then somethings up
BETHANY
Im confused
RUFUS
Bethany Serendipity here isnt technically an angel nor is she by
any
means a human being like I was and you are
SERENDIPITY
Amen to that
(swigs her beer and spits it out)
BETHANY
Then who is she
SERENDIPITY
Not who - what I havent always been part of the anthropomorphic

club I
used to be an abstract

BETHANY
Now Im really lost
RUFUS
Serendipitys an idea
SERENDIPITY

Try all ideas

BETHANY
Meaning
SERENDIPITY
Im a muse stupid

Bethany stares at her for a beat then at Rufus Rufus nods
affirmatively

BETHANY
I cant take much more of this
(downs her beer)
RUFUS
(to Serendipity)
Shes now met a seraphim a dead man and a muse
You can appreciate her frame of mind
BETHANY
(to Serendipity)
So you - what - inspire people
SERENDIPITY
What just went down with your friends over there-you dont think they
thought of that themselves I knew Kanes weak spot for Fat Albert and
passed it along to the boys
RUFUS
If she hadnt interceded theyd be chalk lines right now
BETHANY
You made them sing that song
SERENDIPITY

I offered them a solution out of the hole they dug for themselves
Thankfully they took it

BETHANY
Are you kidding Those two are so dense they wouldnt get a good idea
if
it was given to them in a specially marked box

SERENDIPITY

Dense people are the most open to suggestion - its vou so-called
intelligent folks that have a hard time accepting a good idea

RUFUS
Aint that the truth
BETHANY
Prove it Give me a good idea
SERENDIPITY

If I do and you accept it then youll have confirmation that you are
- as
you say - dense
BETHANY
(beat)
Alright So youre a muse So what kind of people do you inspire -
besides
stupid ones
SERENDIPITY
I used to specialize in entertainment - literature theatre so forth
BETHANY
Movies

SERENDIPITY

In some cases Id do everything but bang starlets on the casting
couch

BETHANY
What have I seen that youve been involved with
SERENDIPITY

Off the top of my head - everything Well almost everything For
example
Im responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time
BETHANY
Nine
SERENDIPITY

The one about the kid by himself in his house burglars trying to get
in

and he fights them off

(Bethany nods)

I had nothing to do with that one Somebody sold their soul to Satan
to get

the grosses up on that piece of shit

RUFUS

Which brings us to the next logical question - what are you doing
stripping

SERENDIPITY
Well you remember why I left right
RUFUS
You were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit
for
your ideas
SERENDIPITY
And sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and
turn
out real trash
(to Bethany)
So I opted to quit being a muse and write for myself I gave my two
weeks
notice got a body fifty bucks and got sent out into the world to
make my
fortune
BETHANY

So what happened

SERENDIPITY
Writers block
RUFUS
Writers block
SERENDIPITY
Can you believe it Me - a muse for Gods sake I sit down in front
of the
typewriter and what do I get Nothing Blank page 1 cant even write
grocery list
BETHANY
What about what you did with Jay and Silent Bob You inspired them
SERENDIPITY
Thats the cosmic joke I can give out a zillion and nine ideas a

second
but I cant keep any for myself Her quirky sense of humor

BETHANY
Whose
SERENDIPITY
Gods
BETHANY
Youre saying Gods a woman
SERENDIPITY

Was there ever a doubt in your mind
BETHANY

The possibility never presented itself Hes always referred to as a
Him

SERENDIPITY

I didnt write it that way My job stops at the idea stage The person
that
holds the pen adds their own perspective and all the pen-holders were
men
One of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in
the
editorial process

RUFUS
Another ones that you cant jerk off
SERENDIPITY
(to Bethany)

See these being male-dominated times the Pharisees and High Priests
felt
threatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling
their
fates so they made sure that She became a He Doesnt stop with God -
the
whole book is slanted and gender-biased a womans responsible for the
first sin the fall of man and the expulsion from Eden a woman cuts
Sampsons coif of power a woman asks for the head of John the
Baptist
Read that book again some time - women are painted as bigger
antagonists

than the fucking Egyptians and Romans combined

BETHANY
(stunned)
God is a woman
SERENDIPITY

I dont know what the big surprise is - women are the only gender that
can

create life just like God created the universe Who else but a mother
could have the infinite patience with impudent children that God has
with

humanity A woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes so
psychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can
feel

completely comfortable with and the faithful - both male and female -
feel

at ease with God In time of trial our first instinct is to implore
the

aid of the Almighty just as when youre a child the only person who
can

make it all better is

BETHANY
-mom God it makes sense
RUFUS
(to Serendipity)
Shit you still have a knack for words
SERENDIPITY
Not really useful in my new line of work
RUFUS
What about that Whyd you choose stripping

SERENDIPITY

In an effort to create something artistic that I could claim as my
own

See Ive been able to fool myself into thinking this isnt stripping
its

dancing and at least dancing is artistic But She wont even give me
that

much - the way God designed dance its the only creative act which
results

in no tangible product Unlike paintings poems movies or most other
arts

forms when the dance is over theres nothing to show for it -
nothing to

save and enjoy or sell

(takes a drink)
Believe me the irony wasnt lost on this muse
RUFUS
How long are you going to keep this up
SERENDIPITY

Believe me I think about eating crow and going back to the grind from
time

to time But Id hate to give Her the satisfaction of my playing the
prodigal And it sucks because I cant stand being flesh anymore -
especially this halfway crap Not only do I have to take care of the
aesthetic - the showers the haircutting the pit-shaving - but I
cant

take advantage of the benefits - like getting laid or using my period
as an

excuse not to get laid
(conspiratorily to Bethany)
the only true boon to having a period from what I understand

RLFLS

Well we could sure use your help We need someone with good ideas

remember a couple of angels named Loki and Bartleby

SERENDIPITY

Sure - the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience

RUFUS
They found a way back
SERENDIPITY
(shocked)
God no Not the plenary indulgence loop hole
BETHANY
You know about that

SERENDIPITY

You

I always knew that thing was a bad idea Leave it to the Catholics to

destroy existence

RUFUS
Bethanys Catholic
SERENDIPITY
My condolences
BETHANY

What do you have against Catholics
SERENDIPITY
Ever been to a Catholic mass
BETHANY

Once or twice
SERENDIPITY
Its like bad sex - up down up down kneel leave
And the whole time youd rather be watching tv
You people dont celebrate your faith - you mourn it
BETHANY
So if were so wrong then whats the right religion
SERENDIPITY
When are you people going to learn Its not about right or wrong -
its a
question of faith It doesnt matter what you believe in - just that
you
believe
Jay and Silent Bob join them wearing bandannas
JAY
Look They made me and Silent Bob part of the gang
Suddenly the doors behind them blast open pouring light into the
oncim
room A huge figure stands in the doorway backlit and acting as a
sepia
filter - the light and vapors surrounding him are brown
FIGURE
(deep gutteral hiss)

Not born shit into existence

Our group stares at the OC brute Jay sniffs the air

JAY
Who farted
SERENDIPITY
Sweet Christ someone wants you bad
BETHANY

What do you mean Whats that smell
RUFUS

Dont tell me thats who I think it is

SERENDIPITh
The stench should say it all
BETHANY
Who the hell is it
SERENDIPITY
An excremental - the Golgothan
BETHANY
A what
RUFUS

A shit-demon
The Golgothan moves slowly from the door toward the group
NO-MAN
No man ofwoman born
The Gang join the others They hold and cover their noses
GANG LEADER
(to Jay loading his piece)

Friend of yours

JAY
(to group)
Is this smelly fuck with us
RUFUS
Hes coming for Bethany
JAY

(to Gang Leader)
Smoke that mother fucker like it aint no thang
GANG LEADER
I knew Id get to wax someone today Represent

The Gang charges OC guns blazing while we hold on the group
Suddenly

the room is filled with screams and wet slurpy noises The group goes
from

staring wide-eyed to shielding themselves The noise stops and Jay
and

Silent Bob look up

The Gang lay about NoMan in trashed dead positions They are covered
murky creamy crap - their wide white eyes frozen in horror NoMan
SCOOps
a finger-full of muck off the leader and eats it smiling
Our heroes start backing up slowly as to not be noticed

JAY
(to Silent Bob)
I guess were in charge of the gang now

BETHANY

What the fuck happened

SERENDIPITY

Go for the bar We might have a few seconds - his short-term memorys
for

shit
JAY
Sos the rest of him
RUFUS
No chance of taking him down
SERENDIPITY

Gee I dont know Lets ask the gangstas

RUFUS
Youre right lets book
They dash NoMan snaps to attention and throws its arm at them
launching
a huge glob of shit through the air
JAY
(running seeing it coming)
SHIT
Everyone leaps behind the bar The shit flies over them and slams
against
the mirror above Immediately it stretches - Blob-like - over the
entire
frame and burns in an acidic fashion
Jay stares horrified
JAY
Now that is some powerful shit
Serendipity pulls at the floor yanking open a door

SERENDIPITY

Quick Get in

Bethany Rufus jay and Silent Bob leap into the darkness Serendipity

follows pulling the door shut on top of them
INT BASEMENT

Our heroes cower beneath the floor door

JAY
What is that thing
SERENDIPITY
You ever hear of Golgotha
BETHANY

Skull place The hill where Christ was crucified

SERENDIPITY
(peering above)

Yeah well it wasnt just Christ up there - the Romans crucified
everybody

on that hill Ahd Christ excluded they were all criminals - killers
brigands thieves rapists And whenever the crucified expired their
bodies would naturally lose muscle control spilling bowel and bladder
in

the process And the result is that walking pile of crap up there the
Golgothan Shit-Demon - Hells chief assassin And hes here for you
girlie

Silent Bob stares at a crack in the doors A milky drop of shit drips
through it

BETHANY

What are we doing down here then Any second now hell be blasting
through that door

SERENDIPITY
Shits brainless If we can sit tight for a couple of minutes hell

forget
what he came for

Suddenly another drop falls Then another Then a steady stream
Silent Bob
taps Rufus and points Rufus reacts

RUFUS
(indicating trickling shit)
Looks like its been taking memory training courses
SERENDIPITY
(off trickle)
JUMP

The five leap from their perch on the steps just as the doors
explode

dumping a torrent of crap on the steps The body of muck morphs into
NoMan

anew NoMan lumbers toward them The group attempting to gain their
bearings on the floor crawls backwards NoMan pulls a piece of
himself

off rolling it around in Its hands

SERENDIPITY
If anybody still remembers any prayers I suggest you start whipping
them
out

Silent Bob stares wide-eyed up at the approaching demon And then
something occurs to him He stops backing up and stands The others
continue moving back

BETHANY
Bob get down Jay
JAY
(to Silent Bob)
You tubby retard Get your ass back on the floor

Silent Bob stands like a statue in the Golgothans path The demon
snarls a

smile moving ever closer Silent Bob reaches into his coat and pulls
a

small canister out He points it at the beast A mist shoots out into
the

face of the Golgothan It pauses looking confused The shitball in
Its

hand drops to the floor and then so does It

Bethany Rufus Serendipity and Jay climb to their feet and crowd
around
Silent Bob They look to the fallen unconscious behemoeth then to
Silent
Bob
BETHANY
(off Bobs canister)
What was that
Silent Bob holds the can out to them its a small trial size can of
Glade
Air Freshener Jay looks at it then at Silent Bob
BETHANY
(reading can)

Knocks strong odors out

RUFUS
Way to go tubby
BETHANY
Why would you ever carrs this

Jay farts Silent Bob sprays the freshener at his ass The others look
at

jay
JAY
What
RUFUS
(to Serendipity)
Who has dominion over this thing
SERENDIPITY

Only Lucifer can order a killing But something doesnt make sense
this

thing never travels alone - with its intelligence level Luciferd
never

allow it It usually has some kind of backup

RUFUS
Can you get some answers
SERENDIPITY
I can give it a shot
BETHANY
Whats going on
RUFUS

Serendipitys going to talk to that demon
JAY
Cool Can we watch
SERENDIPITY

Not a good idea Demons can wreak havoc on the weak-minded
JAY

Fuck you - weak-minded Me and Silent Bob can talk to him in his own
language See

(makes the universal metal sign)
hed understand this
SERENDIPITY
(shakes her head to Rufus)
Whoever sent this might send mor I suggest you take the princess and
get
as far away as possible

(to Bethany)

Ill do what I can to extract some info from shit-boy here If theres
anything helpful Ill get it to you somehow

BETHANY

Thank you And youre a great dancer
SERENDIPITY

(to jay and Silent Bob)
You know youre supposed to be prophets right Start acting like

Why the hell are we getting yelled at

SERENDIPITY

Serendipity looks at Rufus He smiles She hits him laughing He

Then the OC Golgothan makes a groggy grumbling noise
SERENDIPITY

Shit Youd better go Ill take care of the trash

RUFUS

(hugs her)

Good luck

Rufus runs up the steps Serendipity tunrs on the Golgothan
SERENDIPITY

Alright Stinky - lets see what you know

EXT CHURCH -DAY

A suited MAN stands at a podium addressing a small thrall of
reporters

MAN

And now to speak on behalf of his Holiness Catholicism - Wow
campaign

ladies and gentlemen of the press I give you the driving force behind
the

movement - Cardinal Glick

The reporters clap as CARDINAL GLICK takes to the podium He strikes
one as

more of an agent than a man of the cloth as he removes his Wayfarers

GLICK
Thank you Mister Flanagan - one of this parishs chief patrons who
donated the stained-glass likeness of Our Lady of Gleeful Misery that
welcomes you as you enter the church every Sunday

(off index cards)

Ladies and Gentlemen of the press - few would deny that the Catholic
Church

has fallen behind somewhat in the times Catholicism usually strikes
the

average person as an old-fashioned remedy for the ills - both moral
and

psychological - of a society that has since left its stringent rules
and

ornate rituals on the heap with 45s and eight track cassettes And in
an

effort to disprove that the Church has appointed this year as a time
of

renewal both of faith and of style So it is with great pleasure
that I

present you and your parish - mere days away from its centennial
celebration - and the continental United States via Satellite with
the

first of man revamps that the Catholicism -Wow campaign will unveil
over

the next year

(applause)

Now what does this mean for the average church-goer Are we going to
throw

out the rule book and adopt a hippie mentality in regards to our
faith No

Were simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the
aesthetic

and theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the highest
membership numbers on the planet

A few applause ring out Glick smiles
GLICK

Thank you thank you So what are we talking about here Well for
example

(pulls out crucifix)

while it has been a time-honored and traditional symboL of our faith
we

have decided to retire the highly recognizable yet wholely depressing
symbol of our Lord Jesus Christ crucified Why Well look at it
Would
you relish being a member of a group that uses a man nailed to two
pieces

of wood as its masthead Of course not - who would Ive got enough
downers in my daily routine without having to deal with this visual
everytime I go to worship Instead the church is going to adopt this
new

more soothing and inspiring sigil which we feel is in-line with our
new

outlook

Glick pulls a cover off an object to his right - a two foot figure of
Christ smiling and giving the thumbs up The crowd buzzes

GLICK

See Isnt this better How could you not feel just great walking into
a

church and seeing this behind the priest - a positive reinforcement
that

whatever we do God thinks is akay I love this thing its so

REPORTER I
(interupting)

Cardinal Glick - has the church given any thought to its position on
john
Doe Jersey Will he be given the right to die with dignity

Another buzz rises from the crowd Glick rolls his eyes
GLICK

Cmon people Were not here to talk about that Its an issue we
stand

firm on - euthanasia is a big no-no just like abortion Murders
murder

Why wont you people accept that Besides were here to talk about
this

little guy - your friend and mine the happy Jesus Cant you just
see it
on chains around peoples necks and as the new background in avant
garde

MTV videos
INT BUS TERNIINAL - DAY

The image of the Happy jesus - thumbs up and all - is captured on a

monitor a label reading UE VIA SATELLITE - RED BANK NEW JERSEY at
the
bottom of the screen Bartleby and Loki look up at it then at one
another

LOKI
And you say Siskel and Ebert have no influence over this culture
BARTLEBY

Were getting out of here at just the right time These people are
nuts

(off tv)

And thats the church were heading to

BARTLEBY
(steps to ticket window)
If you want to go home
(to WOMAN in window)
Two tickets to New Jersey please
WOMAN
Jerseys sold out sir
BARTLEBY
Are you sure
WOMAN
The computer says
LOKI

Come on - how many people can possibly be going to New Jersey
WOMAN
Enough to fill a bus
BARTLEBY

(to Loki)
You had to drag that judgement out You couldnt just hit and run
(to Woman)
Whens the next one

WOMAN
Same time tomorrow

BARTLEBY

What Doesnt this place warrant at least two buses a day

WOMAN
I take it youve never been to the Garden State Next

Bartleby and Loki look around

LOKI
Theres no one else here

WOMAN
Then I guess its lunch time
(she shuts her window)

LOKI

We should have learned to drive a long time ago Infinite celestial
power
and we cant catch a bus
BARTLEBY
Just shut up this is your fault

LOKI

You can either lament over our mass transit folly or you can listen
to my
suggestion

BARTLEBY

Its your suggestions that prevent us from negotiating what should be
a
simple matter of catching or staying on a bus
LOKI
Why fall victim to gravity when we can just as easily rise above
BARTLEBY
(stares at him)
Fly
LOKI
We got wings right Lets use them

I wouldnt suggest that
The pair spin and gawk

AZRAEL leans in the doorway He removes his hat revealing two stubby
horns

You wouldnt want to stand out now would you
INT STRIP JOINT BASEMENT - DUSK

NoMan is tied to a chair in the middle of the floor Serendipity draws
a

circle around him with lipstick Once finished she takes a glass of
water

and throws it into No Mans face It roars to life The Golgothan
shakes of

his daze turning his attention on Serendipity

NoMAN
The Muse They told us you were up here
SERENDIPITY
Matter of perspective NoMan I like to think of it as down here I
have
a few questions for you sir
NoMan

Free us from these binds that you may have answers

SERENDIPITY
(heads toward it)
Okay
(stops sarcastic)
Oh wait Im smarter than that
NoMan lets out a bellow
SERENDIPITY
Face it big guy - Im not releasing you until I get answers This can
go
hard or easy The sooner I get what I want the sooner youll be free
Now
you can start by telling me why youre on this plane
NoMAN
(beat)
Liquidate the Last Scion
SERENDIPITY
See That wasnt so hard Now - who sent you Was it Lucifer
NoMan laughs in a sinister fashion
NoMAN
Our master is no one and all For a time he will be prince of this
world -
and the fate of those who dwell in it will be at the mercy of his
whimsy
And then he will sever reality and crush existence like a thumb
punctures
a fontanell giving peace to those whove been without for so long
SERENDIPITY
Did Bartleby and Loki send you
NoMAN
Resist no further Muse Deliver over to us the conflicted one that
this
world may die screaming No power - divine or inherited - threatens

the
crusade You cannot win Soon will rise of the cry of the abandonned
begging your God to put an end to the madness And only as being
becomes

not will they know that the God of Abraham lay dormant while the
dream

perished in a blink Your God is not dead - Hes brain dead

SERENDIPITY
She you chauvinist bastard - Shes brain dead And no Shes not Stop
trying to be so spooky Tell me who sent vou or Ill use whatever
influence I have below to make Hell even worse for you

NoMAN

You speak of Azrael
(he laughs)
We pity you Muse Youre still playing the old game The one that
could
have made good on your threat is gone

SERENDIPITY
What do you mean gone He escaped

NoMAN

No soul escapes Hell but one
(beat - as if Its heard something)
Would that I could cross the threshold of your confining circle I
would
crush your half-life throat But my Master does not abandon me to this
mockery of a prison We will come back for the girl And when we do
it
will take more than fragrant mist to keep our hands from crushing her
head

NoMan goes stiff and then limp His body begins to melt

INT TOY STORE - DAY

Azrael leads Bartleby and Loki through the aisles passing tons of
stuffed

animals

BARTLEBY

Jesus Christ Azrael - howd you get out of Hell
AZRAEL

I told them I was coming up on a routine possession I dont have much
time If they figure out my ruse theyll come looking for me

BARTLEIBY
You lied
LOKI
Go figure Him A demon
(to Azrael)
Whyd you bring us in here
AZRAEL

Because you two fucks are inches away from getting yourselves caught
Going
around killing people about to uncase your wings dont you have
any
idea whats going on

LOKI

Were going back home
AZRAEL

Are you so clueless as to think you can just waltz back into Heaven
BARTLEBY

Why not Were going back clean

AZ RAEL

Let me let you in on a little secret okay everyone is looking for
you
Both sides - above and below The orders are to terminate you on
sight

BARTLEBY
(shocked)
Why

AZRAEL
Youre pissing people off thats why Word on the grapevine is that
Gods

pissed off at your presumption and I know Lucifers pissed because
you

assholes might just succeed where hes failed so many times making
him

look bad

BARTLEBY
So theyre going to kill us
AZRAEL

Theyre going to try Thats why you have to travel incognito - tone
down

your behavior stay off their respective radars Go about this thing
more

subtly Quit killing people - thats high profile And for Gods sake
dont uncase your wings until you have to transubstantiate Because
the

minute you let them flap legions of thrones and hordes of demons will
fight each other over who gets to kill you first

(looksOC)
Shhhh

A WOMAN and her small DAUGHTER walk past While the Woman looks at the
items on the top shelf Loki pulls off Azraels hat and taps the
Daughter

on the shoulder He points to Azraels horns The Woman pulls the
Daughter

further down the aisle oblivious to the trio

DAUGHTER
Mommy that man had horns
Azrael grabs his hat and puts it back on

AZRAEL
Thats the kind of shit Im talking about

LOKI

Oh lighten up

BARTLEBY

(still reeling)
I cant believe they want to kill us
AZRAEL
Believe it boys Theyve even got the Last Scion looking for you
LOKI
Youre kidding
AZRAEL
This is big Im telling you Your re-entry is a thorn in a lot of
sides
and theyll stop at nothing to prevent it
LOKI
If thats the case then why arent you hunting for us too
AZRAEL
Because I want to see you go back You were both given a raw deal
almost
as raw as mine If you make it back then I figure theres hope for
me
(looks around)
In the meantime I suggest you find an alternate mode of
transportation If
anything else comes up Ill contact you
BARTLEBY
Thank you Azrael Youre a true friend
AZRAEL
Would you expect anything less from a demon I have to get back to the
Pit
before they get suspicious
(turns to leave)
LOKI

Hey Az - whats it like down there Is it as bad as they say

Give you a hint theyve been playing Mrs Doubtfire continuously

The Train chugs through the darkness

INT TRAIN - NIGHT

Bethany and Rufus sit across from one another They stare out the
window

RUFUS
How you coping kid
BETHANY

Its weird just when I think Ive got a handle on things something
wholely unbelievable presents itself Sometimes I wish I had just

stayed
home

RUFUS
You sound like the Man

BETHANY
(beat)
What was He like

RUFUS
Jesus Black

BETHANY

Besides that

RUFUS
The brother was centered I mean He was God right But I think He
felt

left out because He was more than human you know We used to sit
around

the fire - me and the other guys - and wed be talking about what ass-
holes

the Romans were or getting laid

BETHANY
Some things never change
RUFUS

and Hed just sit there listening and smiling Wed ask Him why He
never

joined in the convo but He said He just liked to hear us talk about
anything Said it was like music I think He just wished He had
unimportant

shit to talk about himself

BETHANY
How does He feel now
RUFUS

He still digs humanity but it bothers Him to see the shit that gets
carried out in His name - wars bigotry but especially the factioning
of

all the religions He said humanity took a good idea and like always
built a belief structure on it

BETHANY

Having beliefs isnt good
RUFUS

I think its better to have ideas You can change an idea Changing a
belief is trickier Life should malleable and progressive working
from

idea to idea permits that Beliefs anchor you to certain points and
limit

growth new ideas cant generate Life becomes stagnant That was one
thing

the Man hated - still life He wanted everyone to be as enthralled
with

living as He was Maybe it had

something to do with knowing when He was going to die but Christ had
this
vitality that Ive never encountered in another person since You know
what
Im saving

BETHANY
He was big on life
RUFUS

It was more than that He was the only person I ever knew who never
engaged
in that most ancient of life-affirming activities

BETHANY
Sex
RUFUS

Debate Thats the only way people know how to reaffirm that theyre
alive

- by debating In all its forms People spend their whole lives
debating
we fight about whos right and whos wrong we fight ourselves we
fight
each other we fight death we fight over beliefs we fight over
fights We

believe that to stop debating - in any fashion -is to stop living and
give
up People say that lifes a struggle but its not Life is living
Im

even guilty of it myself the way I go on about Christs ethnicity
fighting for the truth to come out And Im dead Even in death the
only

way I know how to live is through debate Thats sad isnt it

BETIIANY
Not if you believe its important for people to know
RUFUS

A beliefs a dangerous thing Bethany People die for it People kill
for

it The whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the
Catholic

Belief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit And
whether

they know it or not Bartleby and Loki are exploiting that belief and
if

theyre successful you me all of this ends in a heartbeat
(beat)
All over a belief
Bethany nods Rufus looks around
RUFUS

BARTLEBY
What do you mean

BETHANY
Well theres all that macho bullshit about it being This Mans Army
And
you two meet and hook up while in the service which is so special -
because its so hard to meet anyone you can seriously relate to

BARTLEBY

(catches on)
You think were lovers Oh no No were not gay
BETHANY
(laughs)
Oh God Im sorry I just assumed
BARTLEBY
No We live together and all but at the end of the night I go to my
room
and he goes to his
(beat)
Why Do I come off as gay
BETHANY
(laughing)
No not at all Im sorry My ex-husband kind of fouled up my
relationship
awareness barometer
BARTLEBY
Youre divorced
BETHANY
Thats the nice way of putting it I consider it being dumped
BARTLEBY
was dumped once More or less
BETHANY
ts terrible isnt it Dont you constantly question your value -

like
why was I so easy to cast aside Didnt I have merit

BARTLEBY

And you wonder if the other partys going to come to their senses and
call
you back

BETIIANY
The worst is that I still think like a couple After all these years
I
still have the we mentality

BARTLEBY

Mine grew out of what was really a stupid misunderstanding A
misunderstanding that grew into a total withdrawl of communication
Abandonment And even though it was years ago theres not a day that
goes
by that I dont wonder what went wrong And then it hits me - I was
replaced by someone A lot of someones

BET HANY
And they always tell you itll hurt less with time

BARTLEBY

when actually it hurts more

BETHANY

(beat)

You know what we need We need some drinks A lot of drinks Do you
agree

BARTLEBY
Whole-heartedly
INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
Rufus continues to slumber
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Jay is asleep on Silent Bobs shoulder drooling slightly Loki talks
with
Silent Bob

LOKI

Im telling you man - its all about organized religion and societys
battle against it The Rebels are fighting the Empire right Now the
Empire is led by whom Darth Vader No Its led by the Emperor And
the

Emperor is a practitioner of the Force albeit the Dark Side of the
Force

And the Force is basically a religion
(Silent Bob nods)

So the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule and the Imperial
government is

run by this old religion What you have then is a theocratic
government -

a government run by the church So Luke Han and Leia are fighting
that

government to liberate the galaxy from the pious grip of what is in
essence holy mother church

Silent Bob nods in understanding

Bethany and Bartleby slump in their booth the table loaded with empty
glasses Bethany is quite tipsy Bartleby sips his drinks and
surreptitiously spits it out

BARTLEBY

Youre saying you still go to church

BETHANY
(laughs)
Every Sunday

BARTLEBY
Does it do anything for you

BETHANY

(thinks)
Gives me time to balance my check book every week
BARTLEBY
See Thats what Im talking about People dont go to church and feel
spiritual They go to church and feel bored But they keep going
Every
week Out of habit
BETHANY
Or in habit if youre a nun

BARTLEBY

Oh that wasnt very funny at all
BETHANY
A friend of mine told me that church is like bad sexits messy and
theres
no foreplay
(starts laughing)
No thats not it I am so buzzed
BARTLEBY
When do you think you lost your faith
BETHANY
I remember the exact moment I was on the phone with my mother and
she was

trying to counsel me through what was happening to me and my marriage
And

she said something like Theres always a plan And I just got so
angry I mean I know she was talking about God right - God had a
plan

But I was like What about my plans You know Like dont they count
for
anything I had planned to grow old with my husband and have a family

wasnt that plan good enough for God

(beat)

Apparently not

(swigs her drink)

How about you When did you lose your faith
BARTLEBY

Me Years ago One day God just stopped listening I kept talking

but I

got the distinct impression that He wasnt listening anymore
BETHANY

She And how do you know She was listening in the first place
BARTLEBY

(thinks)

I guess I dont
BETHANY

I hate thoughts like that But they occur to you with age When youre
a

kid you never question the whole faith thing - Gods in Heaven and
Hes Shes always got her eye on you Id give anything to feel
that way

again Which is why I guess I let myself get talked into this
pilgrimage I

needed proof And the opportunity presented itself to find out if it
is

like they told us in Catholic school And I gotta tell you - the last
few

days Ive come across some interesting people that lend toward
convincing

me

BARTLEBY
Wheres this pilgrimage to
INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
Rufus stirs He looks around and stretches
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT
Bethany and Bartleby continue their discussion
BETHANY
Youd never believe me if I told you
BARTLEBY
Try me
BETHANY

Alright But I warned you Okay - Im going to this church in New
Jersey

BARTLEBY
Really
INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
Rufus heads toward the back of the car He opens the door between the

cars
and exits
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT
Bethany and Bartleby talk further Bartlebys intrigued
BETHANY
I was told that Im supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering
the
church Theyre trying
(laughing)
This sounds so stupid Theyre trying to get back into Heaven
INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
Rufus passes through another car and opens the door at the end
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT
Bartleby grows very tense Bethany rattles on half-toasted
BETHANY
See they got tossed out of Heaven years ago right And if they get
back
in it proves God wrong And since God is infallible to prove Her
wrong
would
(laughing hard)

would unmake existence I feel so stupid just saying it

Bartlebys eyes are wide He looks scared Then a calm falls over
him

BETRANY
(laughing)
But the thing I dont get is how do I stop an angel Two even I
guess

Im supposed to talk them out of it or something
Bartleby surreptitiously slides a knife off the table
BARTLEBY

Maybe youre supposed to kill them
Bethany breaks into hysterics

INT TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

Rufus pulls open another door and exits
INT LOUNGE CAR - NIGHT

Bethanys still cracking up oblivious to the on-the-defensive
Bartleby

BETHANY
Oh yeah Kill them Even if that was the case I mean how do you
kill an
angel

BARTLEBY

I dont imagine its much different

(slowly lifts the knife)

from killing a human

The door behind them slides open Rufus steps in
RUFUS

Where the hell is everybody I wake up and

He sees Bartleby They both freeze

BARTLEBY
The Apostle
RUFUS
Holy shit
BETHANY

(stumbling to her feet)

Rufus I want you to meet my friend Barry

Bartleby leaps out of the booth and grabs Bethany holding the knife
to her

throat

BETHANY
(chuckiing)
Barry Dont be such a show off
RUFUS

Take it easy Bartleby Just let her go and lets talk about this

BARTLEBY
After all this time this is what it comes down to -slaughtered by
this
meat puppet

RUFUS
There doesnt have to be a slaughter We can work this out
BETHANY

Is that a knife

BARTLEBY
Oh we can work it out alright Im going to work the blade in and
out of
her thorax
(calling over shoulder)
Loki
Loki catches the action and reacts

LOKI

Holy shit - the Apostle

He leaps from the table Jay stirs and wakes up
JAY

(half asleep)

I didnt come in you I swear

(looks around)

Bartleby with Bethany in hand faces off against Rufus Loki joins
them
LOKI
(to Rufus)
What are you doing here
BARTLEBY
Theyre here to thwart our journey home my friend This one just told
that shes supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering a church
LOKI
You think she was talking about us
BARTLEBY
Id say there was a pretty good chance What do you say Rufus - were
to
be liquidated

RUFUS

It doesnt have to go down like that You havent thought about the
consequences of re-entry

LOKI
Consequences schmonsequences
BARTLEBY

I have to agree with him No one - not you and especially not this
finite-lifer - no one is going to impede us Were going home
regardless

of whose pride it may hurt

RUFUS
Its not a question of pride its
BARTLEBY
Loki - kill the girl
LOKI

(beat)

What are you high
BARTLEBY
Do it
LOKI
I cant kill her if she hasnt done anything you know that And it
looks
like shes on the job so to speak
BARTLEBY
Fine Ill kill her myself
A hand lands on Bartlebys shoulder
JAY
(oblivious to the situation)
Hey man - now its your turn We got enough for a fatty boom-batty
biggety

blunt

Bartleby turns the knife on him

JAY
(not quite getting it yet)
We having cake or something
Loki backhands Jay stunning him

JAY

(dazed)
In grates
Jay drops to the floor out cold Silent Bob grabs Loki and hurls him
down
the aisle Rufus grabs Bartlebys knife hand They struggle Bethany
collapses
RUFUS
TUBBY THE DOOR
Silent Bob jumps over Loki and opens the back door of the car He

grabs
Loki by the collar
LOKI

Wait man Cant we talk about this
He throws Loki out the door off the train
Rufus squeezes Bartlebys hand Bartleby drops the knife and punches
Rufus
in the face Bethany jumps on Bartlebys back covering his eyes They
careen down the aisle toward Silent Bob He pulls Bethany off
Bartlebys
back and kicks him out the back door off the train He quickly slams
the
door closed and leans against it
The Bartender stares at him
Silent Bob brushes off his coat and thumbs toward the door

SILENT BOB
No ticket
Rufus rubs his jaw Bethany crawls up beside him breathing heavily

BETH ANY

I should have known something was wrong when he paid for all the
drinks

INT UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

A door is kicked open Loki enters brushing himself off Bartleby
follows

LOKI
The Apostle is here
BARTLEBY
noticed
LOKI

f thats the case then chick with him must be

BARTLEBY

fq

The Scion Id imagine
(leans against the wall slides down)
LOKI
(in a panic)

Well shit man Maybe we should rethink this whole thing I mean you
heard

the guy - he said there were consequences Azrael tells us were
marked

Maybe theres more to this than we thought about

Bartleby leans against the wall sitting on the ground His demeanor
has
changed He stares into space

BARTLEBY
There sure is
(beat)
Its them
LOKI
(beat)
What
BARTLEBY
(shakes his head)
Them
LOKI
(thinks)
The movie about the giant ants
BARTLEBY

Them - the humans Its what it all comes down to you know Us
against
humanity kind of like that giant ant movie

LOKI

(beat)
Are you alright
BARTLEBY
Im better than alright Ive had an epiphany my friend
LOKI
An epiphany Yes well thatll happen
BARTLEBY

When that sweet innocent girl let her mission slip I suddenly
understood
it all - everything For the first time in all these eons I get it

LOKI
(beat)
Get what
BARTLEBY

In the beginning it was just us and Him Angels and God And then He
created the humans And He gave them more than He ever gave us Ours
was

designed to be a life of servitude and worship - adoration But He
gave the

humans more - He gave them a choice They can choose to ignore God
choose

to acknowledge Him All this time weve been down here everyday I
felt the

absence of the Divine presence And it pained me as Im sure it
must

have pained you sometimes even though youd gloss over it with jokes
But

we feel his absence and why Because of the way He made us -as
servants

Had we been given free will we could ignore the pain like them

LOKI
You know - maybe you should take a nap or something
BARTLEBY

Loki dont you get it Its the humans - its always the humans They
were

given paradise they threw it away They were given this planet they

destroyed it They were favored best among all His endeavors and some
of
them dont even believe He exists Their ego-mania corroded Hell and
made

it dark and crimson

(looks at Loki)

I asked you to lay down your sword years ago - why

Because I felt sorry for them And where did it get us

Thrown out

(smiles)

Weve paid our debt Dont you think its time we went home And to do
that I think we have to dispatch our would-be dispatchers

LOKI

Wait wait wait - kill them Youre talking about the Last Scion
for
Christs sake And what about Jay and Bob - I mean those guys were
alright

BARTLEBY

Dont my friend Dont let your sympathies get the best of you as
they
did me way back when Scion or not shes just a human And
regardless our
sins are forgiven by passing through that arch No harm no foul
LOKI

That sounds thin

BARTLEBY

Fine Well cover ourselves Well take out a slew of people Maybe
amidst
the body count He wont notice
LOKI
Oh thats being realistic
Bartleby reaches out and grabs Loki slamming him against the wall

BARTLEBY

Im going home Loki And nobody - not even the Almighty Himself - is
going
to make that otherwise

Bartleby releases Loki and smiles He exits Loki watches him
LOKI

Shit

He follows

EXT CAMP FIRE - NIGHT

Another Newspaper headline regarding John Doe Jersey fills the
frame It

is lowered to reveal Jay Bethany and Rufus sitting around a
makeshift

fire in the middle of nowhere Jay rolls a joint Silent Bob reads the
paper

BETHANY

I dont understand why we couldnt stay on the train You threw those
guys
off

RUFUS

A very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are then dont
be
there

BETHANY

And whats with that Why are we enemies The guy almost gutted me
for
Gods sake

JAY

He had the knife at your throat To gut you hed have to have the
knife at
your stomach
BETHANY
Semantics Semantics that dont even answer mv question
RUFUS

Well I know Id perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy

BETHANY
What do you mean kill I wasnt asked to kill them -just stop them
from
going into that church

RUFUS

And how were you going to do that Preoccupy them with a game of
Bingo

BETHANY
Ive never killed anything before in my life
JAY
Ill do it
RUFUS
Shut the fuck up little man - you couldnt kill a pint of ice cream
let
alone an angel
JAY
Fuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy
RUFUS
Oh yeah How would you do it

JAY

Id give him a Van Damme neck-break like in Hard Target Djou see
that

flick
RUFUS
(ignoring jay to Bethany)
Killing an angels a two-step process - first you have to cut off

their

wings which then makes them human From that point on its the same
as

killing anything else - head or heart take your pick

BETHANY

You say it as if its easy
RUFUS
(oblivious to Jay)

Problem is I dont think we could pull it off even if we wanted to
All

this time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two
weaker -

and those guys felt far from weak Either that or someones protecting
them

- someone with juice

BETHANY

So then were screwed

(shrugs)

Shit thats the best news lve heard in days
RUFUS

This doesnt excuse you from tryng to stop them

BETHANY

Count me out Youre telling me theyre unstopable Im exhausted -
both

psychologically and physically the odds are against us I say we kick
back

and wait for the end -a little nonxistence might be just what the
doctor

ordered

JAY

Im with her I dont care about dying so long as were all going to
die

RUFUS
What are you babbling about now
JAY

If I was the only one thatd bother me because every-one else would
go on

living having a good time without me But if we all go at once
thatd be

okay because I know Im not missing anything

BETHANY
See You know its right when even hes making sense
JAY
Besides she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die
in
like five minutes shed have sex with me and Silent Bob

RUFUS

So youre suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and
history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid

JAY
(thinks)
No Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid
BETHANY

Now that were all but in total agreement on this Id just like to

finally
know - why me
JAY
Because youve got nice tits
BETHANY

I wasnt talking to you
(to Rufus)
Why me Why do I have to do this Nobodys come
clean on that Out of everyone on the whole god-damned planet How
come I
got tapped
Rufus looks at her He shrugs
RUFUS
Family ties

JAY

That shows funny as hell
RUFUS
Shut up
(to Bethany)
Do you know what the Apocryphal books are
Bethany shakes her head no

RUFUS

Most of that information in the Bible came from the Dead Sea Scrolls -
ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago And when the Sanskrit was
translated they discovered data that conflicted with the lore church
officials had already established as the basis of their religion They
couldnt refute centuries of dogma so they thought it best to leave
certain passages out - sometimes whole books Those books make up the
Apocrypha

BETHANY
Whats this have to do with me

RUFUS

Youve never gotten the complete picture If they had compiled the
material

together like they were supposed to youd get the whole story But by
leaving text out the church has presented you people with an
extremely

sterile and unmoving account of religious history The Creation the
entire

Old Testament the history of Christ

(lets her take it in)
Forget about my whole black angle for a minute
JAY
We might if youd quit bringing it up
Rufus backhands Jay Silent Bob holds jay back Rufus continues
oblivous
to Jay

RUFUS

He goes from twelve years old to thirty Whole volumes of text about
the
eighteen year struggle with His Divine nature prior to His acceptance
of it
were thown out forever lost to the faithful

BETHANY

I dont buy it Integral material like that would give people a better
understanding of the nature of God Why leave it out

RUFUS

Because it was all closely tied in with His family

BETHANY
His mother and father

RUFUS
His brothers and sisters

BETHANY

(beat)

Wait wait wait - Jesus didnt have any brothers or sisters Mary was
a
virgin - thats why its called the Immaculate Conception

RUFUS

Mary gave birth to Christ without having known a mans touch - thats
true

But she did have a husband And do you really think hed have stayed
married to her all those years if he wasnt getting laid The nature
of God

and the Virgin Birth - those are leaps of faith But believing a wife
never

humped her husband - thats just gullibility

BETHANY
(sudden realization)
MARY AND JOSEPH HAD SEX
RUFUS
All the time from what I understand Jesus used to tell me stories

about
hearing them through the walls when He was a kid
(beat)
So you ask why you got tapped Ill tell you why a Christ was the
salvation of this world once before And youre the closest thing to a
Christ that still walks

BETHANY
Meaning

RUFUS

The blood that flows in your veins shares a chromosome or two at the
genetic level with the man you call Jesus

(hand on her shoulder)
Youre His great-grand-niece
Bethanys jaw drops A high-pitched squeak of a word escapes her lips
JAY
(takes a hit from his joint)
So that would make Bethany part black
(to Silent Bob)
Man this is just like when Vader told Luke he was his father
RUFUS
I just wish I knew what the hell were supposed to do now
OC VOICE

You must go to the Dagobah system and find Yoda - the Jedi Master who
instructed me

Everyone turns around Metatron leans against a tree
METATRON
God lve always wanted to say that
RUFUS
The voice

NIETATRON
(mimicking his shock)
The Apostle
(sits down with them)
BETHANY

Now you show up Where were you when that psychotic bastard had a
knife to

my throat
METATRON
I told you youd be in capable hands - youre not dead are you
RUFUS
What are you doing here anyway
METATRON

I felt left out Everyones sitting around coming clean I thought Id
join
in with a confession of mine own
JAY
Now whos this mother fucker
RUFUS
This is the Voice of God - show some respect
JAY
The Voice of God Wheres the rest of Him
METATRON
Funny you should mention that - were not sure
BETHANY
Excuse me

METATRON

Didnt it ever occur to you that this BartlebyLoki situation was well
within the realm of His control

RUFUS
If thats the case then why was Bethany tapped

METATRON
You know those constitutionals He likes to take

BETHANY
Constitutionals
RUFUS

I think were beyond euphemisms at this point
(to Bethany)
Gods a skee-ball fanatic

METATRON

Lets not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds Him
alright

(to Bethany)

Yes - the Lord has quite a fancy for the game been playing it for
years -

He assumes a human form once a month and indulges Doesnt tell anyone
where Hes playing just goes away for a couple of hours Its quite
understandable - a small exercise in handeye coordination has been
proven

as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation And from what I
understand He always gives his free points away to neighborhood
children

Isnt that sweet

BETHANY

But She hasnt come back from one of those day-trips is what youre
getting at

METATRON
(to Rufus)
She I take it shes met the Muse
(to Bethany)

No She hasnt And weve been unable to locate Her
RUFUS
Maybe He was killed Human form has that drawback
M ETAT RON

No - theres a different sort of foul-play afoot children Whomever
has

set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite
well-hidden is also responsible for the Lords whereabouts Were He
to be

killed in human form Hed have immediately returned to Paradise
Somebody

knew enough to keep the body alive but incapacitate Him in another
fashion

- Hes trapped in a body

RUFUS
So Gods not dead
JAY
Hes brain dead
METATRON

So it would seem And as omnipotent as we are above I have to admit
that

were more or less lost without His presence Weve had our people
looking

everywhere for Him And I tapped her because I thought we might be
able to

smoke out whoevers behind this But whoever it is has been clever
enough

to send some lackeys after you as opposed to showing up themselves

RUFUS
Can it be Lucifer
METATRON

Thankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether-regions
I

know theyre not responsible - at least not Lucifer If he was hed
have

made his move by now to conquer Heaven And I know hes not
responsible for

Bartleby and Loki because hed have just as much to lose by their
return as

everyone else
RUFUS
Then what about the Golgothan and the Triplets
METATRON

Dont be stupid - demons arent exclusive to Hell Anybody can summon
one

JAY
(excited)
Yeah
Silent Bob hands Jay his newspaper and points Jay reads
BETHANY
Dont encourage them And why did you lie to me You said I was tapped
asa

test

METATRON
No you said that - I just didnt correct you You were shocked enough

how do you think you wouldve taken it if I told you the face of God
belonged on the back of a milk carton

RUFUS
So what do we do now
M ETAT RON
I say we get drunk kids - because Im all out of ideas
JAY
(off paper)
Why dont we just ask this guy to close the church
METATRON
I beg your pardon
JAY

Here

Glick Takes Heat for Campaign
JAY
Its the guy in charge of the church thing

BETHANY

Cardinal Glick has come under fire for the blatant pandering and
questionable direction of his church-sanctioned Catholicism - Wow
campaign When asked about his motivations for decommisioning the
traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed Olympic sized
lap-pools beneath parish floors Click responded Come on - who
doesnt

like a pool party

JAY

Maybe you could tell him to shut down the church If its closed on
that
day those guys cant get blessed or whatever - right

METATRON
Good Lord - hes got a point

BETHANY

I think Silent Bob had a point But sure - we can go to him and
explain the
situation somehow

RUFUS
We Youre back in
BETHANY
Well mine is a heritage Divine and I wouldnt want to let down the

family

(smiles)
METATRON
(off Silent Bob)
Well well well - the prophets finally live up to their titles

Silent Bob shrugs Jay is trying to look down Serendipitys shirt She
back-hands him

A hand switches off the tv Pan up to Cardinal Click all smiles
GLICK
Well Doesnt it pop
Bethany Rufus lay and Silent Bob are at a total loss for words
JAY
(After a long beat)
Does it come in chocolate flavor
The Cardinal picks up a golf putter and begins putting into an
overturned
glass
GLICK
You see Now this ones got vision

(to Jay)
Were rolling out the flavors in September Big cereal month with the
kids
back to school and all

BETHANY
Its a bit startling
GLICK

Exactly And thats what were looking to do - shake these people up a
bit

get them motivated Thats the whole point of the campaign Mass
attendance

is at an all-time low in this country And its not like were losing
them

to the Protestants or Baptists - people arent practicing at any
denomination these days If we can sell them some show - let em know
the

Catholic church has some panache we can win them back -even get some
new

ones Fill them pews people - thats the key And cross-promoting -
like

with the cereal tie-in grabs the little ones as well Hook em while
theyre young

(sits at his desk lights smoke)

RUFUS
Kind of like the tobacco industry

GLICK

Oh - if only we had their numbers But we are aiming for the same
demographic even though mine is the soulsaving biz And if I have to
play

a bit of the devil to bring them closer to the Lord then Ill wear
the

cloven hooves and carry the pitch fork

Jay and Silent Bob adjourn themselves from the group and approach a
hat
rack where the Cardinals CASSOCK and MITER hang Jay nudges Silent
Bob

OC BFTHANY

We really appreciate you seeing us this late in the day your
Emminence My

friends and I have been traveling all night in hopes of getting a
chance to
talk to you about the Saint Michaels Re-Dedication ceremony
The Cardinal blows smoke rings
GLICK
Youd like to help out in some way
BETHANY
Wed like you to cancel the ceremony and the re
dedication
GLICK
(pauses mid-ash-tap)
I beg your pardon
Silent Bob stands alone by the coat rack Jay leaps into the frame
cassock
tied around his shoulder like a cape He strikes a Superman pose
Oc BETHANY
Theres going to be a world of trouble if tomorrows ceremony goes
forward

as planned

The Cardinal leans back in his chair

CLICK
What is this - a threat Are you planning some sort of demonstation
(pause)
Are you pro-choicers
BETHANY

No the troubles not from us Its from these renegade angels whove
been
stuck on earth since the plagues
Rufus side-kicks Bethany nonchalantly
BETHANY

Uh these guys who think theyre renegade angels
RUFLS

See padre it goes down like this - the boys believe that by passing
through the archway they can get to Heaven Granted its far-fetched
but

the brothers are convinced its the truth

Silent Bob watches as the Miter appears slowly from behind the
partition

resembling a shark fin It swims to and fro menacingly Silent Bob
shakes his head

OC GLICK
And you want me to call off the ceremony for that
Bethany leans forward in her seat

BETHANY

Well theyre very passionate about it Dangerously so They could
turn
violent if they walk through that arch and nothing happens
RUFUS
These guys could blow and if they do theyre going to take some
people
with them Call this thing off
CLICK
(beat)
Who sent you Someone from the Council of Churches right Somebodys
upset
that were getting so much publicity- is that it Who was it Rabbi
Sloss

We were sent by Him who is called I Am
GLICK
Cute
(standing)

Time to go kids Play time with the Cardinal is over

RUFUS
(to Bethany)
Worked for Moses
BETHANY
Stay out of this
(to Glick)

Your Emminence its not a joke These guys are an accident waiting to
happen And if the re-edication ceremony goes on as planned

GLICK
then these loonies will show up and go nuts thus endangering the
lives
of all assembled including the Governor the press me the leaders
of the
Council of Churches Heck lets not stop there maybe even God
Himself

BETHANY

You cant say Himself it could be a woman

GLICK
(rubs temples)
Your passion for all topics insignificant including the gender of our
almighty lord tests my patience people Now Im a very important man
with
very important matters that demand my attention so if youll
please

RUFUS
Im telling you man this ceremony is a mistake

GLICK
The Catholic Church does not make mistakes

RUFUS
What about the churchs silent consent to the slave trade

BETHANY

And its platform of non-involvement during the Holocaust
CLICK
(beat)

Alright those were mistakes But one can hardly hold the current
incarnation of Holy Mother Church responsible for oversights of old
Now

Ive indulged you for more time than I should have Please go

BETHANY
But tomorrow
CLICK

(losing it)
Tomorrow goes off without a hitch Do I make myself clear I did not
labor

two years and exhaust eve ounce of my being to insure that this
ceremony

be a cornerstone in the most important liturgical event since Vatican
Two

just to cancel it at the zero hour at the insistence of a wandering
band of

pranksters whove targeted me as the focus of their evenings
merriment

This occasion is important for the congregation of this parish for
the

massive crowds coming for the plenary indulgence for me for his
Holiness

the Pope and - most importantly - for the Catholicism - Wow
campaign

And neither you nor any other influence short of the hand of God

(glares at Bethany)
HIM -self will prevent it from occurring successfully

He violently grabs the Mitershark fin swimming behind the
partition

GLICK
AND TAKEOFF MY GODDAMN HAT
Jay slowly looks over the partition
EXT SEASHORE

The sun slowly rises The day has arrived
EXT TURNPIKE - EARLY MORNING

Amidst very little traffic two figures emerge from the shadows on the
Pennsylvania side Bartleby and Loki step purposefully past the green
sign

that welcomes motorists to New Jersey

INT BAR - DAWN

The place is empty except for Bethany Rufus Jay and Silent Bob and
A

BARTENDER

BETHANY
I can almost see the headlines - if there were going to be any -
Existence

Erased - Thanks to some prick in a scarlet cape
RUFUS
Its a crime that a guy like him even gets to wear a scarlet cape
JAY
That aint no crime You wanna see a crime Look what we stole from
the guy
in the dress
(to Silent Bob)
Hand it over
Silent Bob pulls a golf club from out of his coat
BETHANY
Oh my God Were going straight to Hell I know it
RUFUS
You stole the Cardinals driver
JAY
I told him to You know how much these things are worth Thats at
least a

couple of sodas and a pack of smokes right there

BETHANY
What do we do now
RUFUS
Let them keep it In a couple of hours it wont matter anyway
BETHANY
Not that - about Bartleby and Loki
RUFUS
We have no choice but to try to kill them
BETHANY
(to Rufus)
But you said they couldnt be killed
OC VOICE
Correction they wont be killed
The gang turns to see Azrael sitting at the bar
AZRAEL
And just to insure that were all going to sit tight right here

until
the two idiots pass through that arch

JAY
Hey
BETHANY
He wasnt talking about you two
OC VOICE

Theres only one idiot here Azrael

Bethany and Rufus react as does the very surprised Azrael
Serendipity

stands in the doorway

SERENDIPITY

And thats you
AZRAEL
The Muse Just in time to join us for a drink
BARTENDER
(suddenly noticing Azrael)
Hey Whered you come from
AZRAEL
Nothingness And thats where Im returning to in approximately
(checks watch)
onehour
BARTENDER

Alright Plato - sounds like youve had enough drinks already Lets
go

AZRAEL
Come on Barkeep - just one drink for the road Then Im gone
Serendipity joins Bethany and Rufus She whispers
SERENDIPITY

I was trying to find you - to tell you Id figured out who was behind
all

this
RUFUS
Is that who I think it is
SERENDIPITY
None other than
BETHANY
Who is it
SERENDIPITY

Thats my worst suspicions confirmed

The Bartender relents
BARTENDER

Alright - one drink Then youre gone

AZRAEL
Gimme a Holy Bartender

BARTENDER
Never heard of it

AZRAEL

(to the group)
He doesnt know how to make a Holy Bartender
You know - dont you Muse

SERENDIPITY
Azrael dont

AZRAEL

(ignoring her)
Anybody Well - I know how to make a Holy Bartender
Azrael pulls an Uzi from his coat and blows a dozen holes in the
Bartender
The Stygian Triplets burst through the doors and everyone jumps to

their
feet with the exception of the Bartender who dies

AZRAEL
Get it
SERENDIPITY
Sweet Jesus Azrael - why
RUFUS

(rushing him)

Cmon demon - lets see you try that shit on a brother whose already
dead
The Stygian Triplets cross their sticks in front of Rufus to block him
as
Azrael trains his Uzi on Bethany

AZRAEL
(joining them)

You maintain that kind of an attitude and you and the barkeep wont be
the
only corpses in the room -the Christ-Bitch will join you

SERENDIPITY

I cant believe youre behind this Are you really that stupid Do
you
know whats going to happen if those two jerks enter that church

AZRAEL

Im actually counting on it And if my calculations are correct the
pawns
are moving in to check-mate as we speak

Everyone stares at Azrael with the exception of Jay He suddenly
laughs

JAY
I get it Holy Bartender Thats a good one
EXT SAINT MICHAELS CHURCH - MORNING

A formidable crowd of parishoners surrounds a small stage ten yards
from

the front of the church Banners hang everyere heralding
Catholicism -

Wow as well as the Centennial of Saint Michaels The media eats it
up

Cardinal Glick stands at the podium all smiles Hes in mid-speech

GLICK

Id also like to acknowledge this great states Governor Elizabeth
Dalton

for coming out an helping us ring in the first hundred years of this
little

parish True shes a Protestant - but we wont hold that against her

(crowd laughs)
Now let me just give you a bit of history on this particular little
hundred years young House of God

OC BARTLEBY
This is no longer Gods House God doesnt live here anymore
The crowd turns aghast Bartleby pushes his way through them
sheepishly
followed by Loki

BARTLEBY
Hes grown weary of your superficial faith and has turned a deaf ear
to
your lip-service prayers He is no longer amused and has abandonned
you -
His favorites - to the whim of judgement Hypocrites and charlatans -
prepare to taste Gods wrath

LOKI

(whispering)
Maybe we should just go

BARTLEBY
You wanted your body count you got it This lot is rife with sin
Well
judge them all
Glick grabs a COP from the crowd and pushes him toward the pair

CLICK

These are the two I was warned about Officer McChee Please assist
them
off the church grounds
The Cop grabs Bartlebys arm

COP

Alright mouthpiece lets leave the nice Cardinal alone and go for a
ride

Bartleby grabs the cops hand on his shoulder

BARTLEBY
Mister McGhee dont make me angry You wouldnt like me when Im
angry

COP
Is that so Well lets just
Bartleby throws his other hand forward and twists the Cops head
around in

one brisk motion Lokis eyes bug out The crowd takes flight

BARTLEBY

(releasing dead Cop)
Ladies and Gentlemen - you have been judged as guilty of violations
against
our Almighty Lord And this very day - I assure you - you will all pay
for
your tresspasses in blood
(to Loki)
Wings Now
LOKI

Im not so sure

BARTLEBY
Do IT
INT BAR - LATER
Azrael still hosts his captive audience uzi trained on the mortals

The
Stygian Triplets surround them brandishing their sticks

BETHANY
Youre a muse too
SERENDIPITY
Former muse He was kicked out
AZRAEL

Tell them Serendipity Tell them how I was slighted by the Almighty

SERENDIPITY
You got what you deserved you yellow shithead
AZRAEL

Ever the apple polisher Id hoped that when you left Paradise you
did it
finally because you couldnt tolerate the injustice that was visited
upon
your own brother
BETHANY

Hes your brother

SERENDIPITY

Not technically We were created at the same time
AZRAEL

To compliment one another Two spirits of pure inspiration
BARTLEBY

So what happened
AZRAEL

Yes What Lucifer got restless and started his little war for the
throne

Heaven became divided into two factions - the faithful and the
renegades

The ethereal planes were chaotic with battle angel against angel And
when

it was all over Cod cast the rebels into perdition

SERENDIPITY

But Azrael refused to fight He wouldnt ally himself to God or

Lucifer He

remained in the middle waiting to see who came out victorious
JAY

What are you - some kind of fucking chicken

AZRAEL

I was an artist I was inspiration A muse has no place in battle Our
job
is to create - not destroy
SERENDIPITY

So after the fallen were banished to Hell God turned on those that
wouldnt fight and my brother here was sent down with the demons
Something he considers a grave injustice

AZRAEL

Dont tell me that you never questioned the judgement Serendipity
that
you dont think the Almighty acted too rashly

SERENDIPITY

Youve been waiting for millions of years to ask me that havent you
Its

been on your mind since the moment you fell Its been gnawing at you
this

long

AZRAEL
Well
SERENDIPITY
No Azrael It never bothered me and Ill tell you why

you stood behind your office you prick So you were an artist - big
deal

Elvis was an artist but that didnt stop him from joining the service
in

time of war Thats why hes the King and youre a schmuck

BETHANY

So all this is about revenge Youre going to unmake existence
because you
have a grudge against God

AZRAEL
After the first million years revenge was the farthest thing from my
mind
Self-preservation became the only necessity
RUFUS
Meaning

AZRAEL
Escape Escape from Hell became my all-consuming reason So I studied
the

religions and waited for my opportunity to present itself which
flnallv

did in the form of the plenary indulgence And while I couldnt
exercise it

myself I knew the perfect vessels through which I could free myself
from

torment

RUFUS
Bartleby and Loki
AZRAEL

After that it was a simple matter or waiting for a church to
celebrate

their Centennial and when that finally happened applying some of the
old

inspiration tactics - bv sending the pair an article laced with ideas
An

incantation I picked up in the Pit kept them cloaked and off Heavens
radars and aside from the Triplets and the Gologothan no soul in
Hell had

a clue as to what was going on

(smiles)
Wont proud Lucifer weep when he realizes I triumphed over the Power
ina
way he never dared or dreamed
(shakes it off)
But no plan no matter how intricate could succeed if the Almighty
was in
the realm of the quick So I dispatched Him in a fairly ingenious
fashion
BETHANY
How so

AZRAEL

Oh no Ive seen way to many Bond movies to know that you never reveal
all

the details of your plan - no matter how close you may think you are
to
success Suffice it to say the Catholics have been even more helpful
in
insuring my success than by just supplying the clean-slate archwav

(gets up)

The only X-Factor was the involvement of the Last Scion Im amazed
that

someone up there would have the balls to make a move without the
Lords

say-so Believe me - I sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that
train But alas here you are - powerless to stop the inevitable

BETHANY

Look asshole - I dont know if anyone explained the rules to you but
if
you succeed everything gets blinked out of existence - even you

AZRAEL

(beat)

Human have you ever been to Hell I think not Do you know that once
Hell

was nothing more than the absence of Cod And if youd ever been in
His

presence then youd realize thats punishment enough But then your
kind

came along - and made it so much worse

BETHANY

Humans arent capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon like
yourself is

AZRAEL

Evil is an abstract its a human construct But true to his
irresponsible

nature man won t own up to being the engineer of evil so he blames
his

dark deeds on my ilk But his selfishness is limitless and its not
enough

for him to shadow his own existence He turned Hell into a suffering
Pitt -

fire wailing darkness - the kind of place anyone would do anything
to get

out of And why Because he lacks the ability to forgive himself It
is

beyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the
sins you
commit No - you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a
foundless belief that God could never forgive your grievous
offenses So

you bring your guilt and inner-decay with you to Hell - where the
horrid

imaginations of so many gluttons-for-punishment give birth to the
sickness

that has infected the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived
there

begging to be punished And in doing so theyve transformed the
cold and

solitude to pain and misery Ive spent eons privy to the flames
inhaling

the decay hearing the wail of the damned I know what effect such
horrors

have on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg

(beat)

Would you like to glimpse pain eternal Look

Azrael places his hand over Bethanys eyes For about ten seconds we
see

some of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed
into

240 frames of film

Azrael pulls his hand away Bethany is fried convulsing
uncontrolably

AZRAEL
Id rather not exist than go back to that And if everyone has to go
down
with me so be it

SERENDIPITY

(holding up Bethany)
Youre still thinking only about yourself you fuckmg child

AZRAEL
Now now now Things are getting too tense in here What say we watch
little tv

(grabs remote control)

JAY
Put on channel nine - Davey and Goliath
A Stygian Triplet smacks him with its hockey stick
JAY
Hey
AZRAEL
I was thinking more along the lines of current events

On the TV - a sweaty and panicked REPORTER barks into the camera
obscuring the chaos behind him Screams are heard

REPORTER

I repeat - men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to St

Michaels Bullets dont seem to affect them police who were on
the
scene are dead The remaining crowd has dropped to their knees

identifying this as the fabled Apocalypse Im not a man of faith
but Im

inclined to agree with them

(looking OC)

NO DONT COME ANY CLOSER

(pulls gun)

PLEASE Please

He puts the gun in his mouth and fires The screen goes blank

AZRAEL
(snapping off tv)
You see that And I told them to keep a low profile Id be pissed
but in
a couple of minutes it wont matter anymore
While he speaks Serendipity looks to Silent Bob Silent Bob snaps to
attention and locks eyes with Serendipity He looks to the golf club
then
back at her He nods

Azrael suddenly catches the exchange between the two

AZRAEL
Now what was that all about

SERENDIPITY
Hunhh Oh nothing I had something in my eye

AZRAEL

(getting up)
Bullshit What are you trying to do Serendipity -get the guy killed
whos the fucking child What did you tell him - to hit me with the
golf
club Are you serious

(picks up golf club)

Im a fucking demon and youd have him assault me with athletic
equipment

(hands club to Silent Bob)
Well here then - take it Call it a gift
(stands back and hits his own chest)
Take a shot - take your best shot Cmon - cmon bright boy
The Stygian Triplets snicker Silent Bob stares at Azrael perplexed
AZRAEL
Dont you know anything
Silent Bob looks to Serendipity She nods He shrugs and swings the
club
with all his might into Azraels chest - which caves in blowing muck
and
shit everywhere
Rufus Jay and Serendipity turn on their captors grabbing the
Stygian
Triplets by the throats
SERENDIPITY
BETHANY BLESS THE SINK

BETHANY

WHAT
SERENDIPITY
DO IT

Bethany leaps over the bar pushing over the dead bartender and
blesses

the melting-ice filled sink Serendipity urges Rufus and Jay to follow
her

with the Triplets in hand They submerge them - head first - in the
sink

Cruddy steam and muck blows out of the water The Triplets convulse
and

fall still

Azrael clutches at his sucking chest wound dropping to his knees He
grabs
Silent Bobs leg Silent Bob kicks him onto his back and out cold

JAY
(joining Silent Bob)
What the fuck have you been eating
Silent Bob shrugs
BETHANY
What just happened
SERENDIPITY
(collecting hockey sticks)

He said it himself - hes a demon You hit a demon with an instrument
of
God - the pure sides always going to do the most damage

JAY
Silent Bobs an instrument of God
SERENDIPITY
No - but the driver is
BETHANY

(catching on)
And Glicks the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a
better
game And the sink
SERENDIPITY

Youve got that Divine heritage going for you - sanctifing is just one
of
the fringe benefits

BETHANY
Remind me to try the water-to-wine thing at my next party
(to Jay)
How far away is this church

JAY

Three towns over - about five miles

BETHANY
Weve gotta make tracks people - there isnt much time left Rufus
grab
his gun

RUFUS
Ten steps ahead of you

BETHANY

(going through dead bartenders pockets)

We can take the bartenders car - I dont think hell be needing it
anymore

Bethany and Serendipity rush out
JAY
We gonna make it
RUFUS
Was Jesus down
Rufus and Jay exit Silent Bob stares down at Azraels body Jay comes

back
and yanks him out the door
EXT STREET - DAY

Cardinal Click runs to a pay phone Sweating and bloody he looks a

mess

He presses 0Q and looks around wildly - particularly skyward
GLICK

(to God)

Look if you didnt like the cereal thing we couldve gone ina

different

direction

(to phone)

OPERATOR SEND MORE POLICE TO SAINT MICHAELS PARISH - NOW PEOPLE

ARE
GETTING KILLED BY

As he speaks a large shadow falls over him from above It grows
larger
enveloping Click He drops the receiver drops to his knees and
screams
EXT SAINT MICHAELS - DAY
Bethany Jay Serendipity Silent Bob and Rufus stare OC horrified

JAY
Holy shit
Bodies bodies everywhere - partial whole bloody - hanging burning
upended No one is left standing Its a scene straight out of Hell
Bethany buries her face in Rufus chest

JAY
See And people wonder why I dont go to church

BETHANY
Are we too late
SERENDIPITY

To save these poor schmucks yes But we still exist

BETHANY
Where are they
RUFUS
They could already be in the church

SERENDIPITY

Which means that if they come out nobody touches them
JAY

Are you shitting me The brother here is going to shred them with his
Schwarzenneger special - aint you homey

SERENDIPITY

If theyve passed through that arch they come out clean And if they
die
they go straight up - and we know what happens then

JAY

What if they just kill themselves

BETHANY

They cant - its a mortal sin You die with a mortal sin on your soul
and
you burn Theyd go to hell and thats not what theyre after

JAY

So then what the fuck are we supposed to do Just wait for a solution
to
fall out of the sky

On cue a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before the
group quite like Rufus had way back at the start This body
however

bursts apart like a body would if dropped from a large height Jay
looks at

Rufus

JAY
Friend of yours
RUFUS

fraid not
OC VOICE
It was a Cardinal

They all turn to see Loki leaning against a body or two drinking
from a

bottle of champagne His wings lie beside him filthy - blood
spattered and

ashen He looks exhausted Rufus trains the gun on him

LOKI

Kind of hard to tell with his face like that but the Rosaries are a
dead

giveaway
JAY
(goes for the Uzi)
ITS ONE OF THEM KILL IT
BETHANY

(struggling to stop him)
NO
She slaps the Uzi out of Jays grip It clatters to the side
BETHANY
(to Jay)
Dont you listen We cant touch them
JAY

I wasnt gonna touch him I was gonna shoot him

LOKI
(looking skyward)
Hes been at it for awhile now
In the distance above - a mere shadow against the sky - something
winged
soars and stops releasing what looks like a very panicky human being

oc LOKI
We ran out of parishoners so he just started picking up anyone off
the
street Youre looking at eons of repression getting purged If only
wed
been able to jerk off
Loki drags himself a few feet backwards
LOKI
Id step back if I were you

They jump back just as the body hits the ground and explodes Bethany
charges at Loki grabs his lapels and shakes him furiously

BETHANY
WHY WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU HOPE TO PROVE ALL THESE PEOPLE - WHY
JAY
(to Rufus)
thought we werent supposed to touch them
RUFUS
think our Bethans about hit her ceiling
Loki slaps Bethany away non-chalantly

LOKI

This wasnt my idea alright I just wanted to go home

(takes a big champagne swig)

We both wanted to go home But he snapped When he realized who you
were

and what youd have to do he just lost it

(smiles)

You know whats funny about it He never could stand to see me work
He

said he always felt son for you people - that you didnt know any
better

(looks up)

Now look at him
JAY
This guys drunker than hell
SERENDIPITY
Which means hes human now - his wings have been cut off
(slapping Loki to sober him up)
Loki Loki
LOKI
(recognizing her)
The Muse Havent seen you in a long time Whats with the tits
SERENDIPITY
Loki - have you walked through the arch yet Cmon tell me Have you
gone
in and come out through the archway yet
VOICE
No

Bartleby lands beside them draping his wings at his sides brushing
himself off

BARTLEBY
We were awaiting your arrival
SERENDIPITY
Bartleby - listen to me You cant go through with this Azrael was
just
using you If you go back this way
Bartleby slaps her down
BARTLEBY
Ive become aware of the reprocussions Muse I know what Im doing
Bethany leaps at him all fists and fury

BETHANY

YOU FUCK YOU SICK TWISTED FUCK LOOK WHAT YOUVE DONE LOOK AT All
youve

done

Bartleby subdues her He strokes her hair
BARTLEBY

Bethany - you of all people should understand what Im ting to
accomplish

here You too have been abandonned You know what its like to be cast
aside But while youve only felt the devastating effects for a few
years

Ive dealt with it for millenia And while you never see your ex-
husband or

how blissful he is with his new wife

(picks up her face and smiles at her)
And he is
(drops her head)

seeing you people everywhere everyday trapped on this perfect
little

world He created for you its a constant reminder that though my
kind

came first your kind was most revered And your kind knows
forgiveness

while my kind knows regret A lesson must be taught All are
accountable

even God

(steps back)
Soon a cadre of police will arrive just in time to kill us as we exit

the
church And then this failed experiment called existence will cease to

be
Loki stumbles to his feet
LOKI
cant let you do this Bartleby
(he sways as if drunk)
didnt know we would end existence

BARTLEBY
(to Bethany)
My compatriot Genocide takes a lot out of him Hes weakened And
more
importantly hes now a human being A condition that carries two
liabilities a conscience
Bartleby pulls a knife and guts Loki He stares at Bartleby as he
dies
confused and betrayed Serendipity nods to Rufus and Silent Bob

BARTLEBY
and a short life span
(in a whisper to Loki)
Sorry old friend - but you lost the faith
Rufus and Serendipity and Silent Bob jump Bartleby and start throwing
punches Silent Bob bites his wing Jay grabs Bethany and pulls her
behind
a bush

BETHANY
(peering out from behind)
Hes lost it Were fucked Were absolutely fucked

JAY

(pulling off clothes)
I hear you

BETHANY
I cant believe this shit Were on the brink of nonexistence and
Gods
still nowhere to be found What the fuck kind of deity gets
kidnapped

JAY

(pulling open pants)
Amen to that

BETHANY

(suddenly notices him)
What the hell are you doing
JAY
Id say weve got about five minutes left to live the whole worlds
going
to end You said youd fuck me
BETHANY
Are you a complete lunatic Everyones out there battling that thing

JAY
No - no time for that foreplay stuff just sex
BETHANY

Bethany freezes
BETHANY

JAY

Rufus and Serendipity battle Bartleby his wings thrashing about
Silent

BETHANY
