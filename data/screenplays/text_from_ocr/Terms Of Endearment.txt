OPEN ON 1

A black screen at the lower left hand corner of which
shines a small clowns face It is barely noticeable
as we BEGIN TITLES

The music is bright but not so full that we dont
discern with ever increasing awareness the off-screen
voices of a man and a woman AURORA and RUDYARD GREENWAY
We hear the downstairs front door close as AURORA arrives
home and shouts upstairs to her husband I cant stand
being a mother Give it a chance Its only been a
week “Are you still in that tub The docter says
Im supposed to soak Have you gotten out to check
her Yes shes fine How was your evening
Everybody was having fun tonight and all I got to do
was worry about the baby Her footsteps approach

her conversation continues We hear one more exchance
between husband and wife Aurora youve just got to
stop imagining that something terrible is happenins to
her all the time “I know I know” The door at
screen right opens and we now can recognize from the
light flowing in from the hall that we are in a babys
room--the clowns face a small nicht light The

infant is in a hand worked excellent and therefore
memorable crib AURORAS back is to the camera--her
rear end a larse one perhaps tempting to some--ané

her back-lit outline is round and cushy She tosses

off one more comment to her husband She is just

about a week old How endless is the fascination
supposed to be And now she turns towards the room

and is facing the camera still illuminated from behind--
the mothers form we may all remember framed in the
doorways of our rooms as we lay helpless and needing
AURORA stands still for a beat and then in a tone
fearful but firm says her first on screen words

AURORA
Rudyard shes not breathing

RUDYARDS VOICE
Oh not again

The lump under the pink blanket behind the licht
wooden bars of the crib is not budaing

AURORA
No this time shes dead

RUDYARDS VOICE
Shes asleep

i 1

AURORA
Its erib death

RUDYARDS VOICE
(annoyed)
Aurora its just that she hasnt
Slept today

AURORA
Maybe

The thirtyish mother pads quietly to her infant
daughters crib and coos softly

AURORA
Emma Emma

The infant lies still AURORA leans overthen

hikes herself up by placing her foot on the mattress

so she fully leans over the bars--gracelessly to place
her ear almost atop the infants chest She hac heard
something but doubt still lingers Very deliberately
AURORA pinches the infant who instantly begins wailing

AURORA
(now more herself)
There thats better
She moves swiftly from the room and exits without a
thought of pacifying the crying babv As she closes
the door
cUT TO

EXT GREENWAY HOME EIGHT YEARS LATER

tw

A two-door dark car arrives From the drivers seat
steps a man of 40 in a dark blue suit and cowboy boots
He was RUDYARDS employer He holds a hand out to
assist ROSIE DUNLOP AURORAS maid for years and though
she doesnt know it the last white maid in Houston

She refuses the hand and concentrates on the next one
eut folding back the front seat for EMMA GREENWAY--
misshapen for a child of eight--her legs too short

her hands too thick--that sort of thing--hair unusually
stringy is even worse after the sweaty and emctional
funeral a black ribbon hanes lifeless in her tresses
She too refuses help and indicates that the man should
instead help the next occupant Thats AURORA who
emerges in black one hand held by the man the other

by her maid The first thing she does on emerging from
the car is to remceve her shoes She has her arm around
her young daughter as she moves barefoot across the lawn

AURORA
Thank you Rosie
(then to man)
Thank you

AURORA is totally composed The man stands there granite
strons West Texas best

MAN
Glad to help He was about the
most dependable man who ever
worked for me

She starts for the house holding MMA by the hand as
ROSIE goes on ahead

AURORA
It was nice knowing you
EMMA
(to man)
Bye
MAN

Im real sorry about your daddy

EMMA
Me too I loved him He stuck
up for me sometimes

MAN
Hey
(Emma turns)
Take care of your momma

EMMA shifts uncomfortably as her mother looks at her
wanting the mans words to register

As they enter the house AURORA walks straight to the 3
mantle over the never used fireplace where there is a
framed picture of EMMA as a baby with her mother and

a framed picture of RUDYARD AURORA takes down the
picture of RUDYARD Then suddenly AURORA reacts

having just thought of something

ROSIE
Whats wrong

AURORA

I just remembered Rudyard wanted
to be cremated

AURORA Sighs briefly and shakes her head at her
forgetfulness

EMMA
(entering scene)
What are you going to do with
Daddys picture

AURORA
I don’t think we should leave it
on the mantle There comes a time
when we have to stop living in
the past

EMMA
Can I have it

AURORA hands it to her daughter RCSIE loving the
ehild from the doorway of the dining room where she
is alreagy setting the table for lunch We follow
EMMA past the stairs to the first floor room that
is hers

a lamp and several of the stuffed animals She removes
two of her favored ones a dog and a panda bear ane
puts her fathers picture in their place She must
remove one more animal to make room

INT AURORAS BEDROOM - NIGHT 5

So feminine its hard to believe a man shared this room

til this evening A small original Renoir hangs
prominently over the dresser The bed is larce and
soft A window seat also cushy overlooks the back
garden AURORA sits in her nightgown at the window
seat Her bed has been turned down but she cannot

As EMMA makes room and AURORA slides in next to her

glances at her daughters limp stringy tresses

AURORA
What will we ever do with your hair

She turns cut the lights
EXT AURORAS BLOCK - DAY (EIGHT YEARS LATER)

EMMA her hopeless hair unaided by the style of the day
is the kind of high school girl whose near dumpiness
seems only a minor hindrance because she so totally
accepts it She is walking with her best friend

PATSY CLARK PATSY is a bright blonde Bayou Club
beauty She is athletic warm and sensitive seemincly
perfect in every way with even the good grace to have a
bit of a tortured soul As they arrive at the house

EXT AURORAS BACKYARD - DAY

A good lawn--a garden AURORA cares for trees to give

her privacy from
aspect of AURORA

her River Oaks neighbors--another
S perfect nest

AURORA can now be fully and clearly seen for the first
time without veil or shadows She is nearing 40 and

she has a rather

simple method for appearing younger

She allows herself to be courted by much older men
Standing over her as she reclines in her chaise is

EDWARD JOHNSON

Hes 56 years old Hes here to

assert himself but once more AURORA is putting him

throuch some tryi

ng paces

EDWARD

I might not be able to get away
later--Tahiti might make a difference

for us

fact that you have certain biological

needs

AURORA
(absently)
Because I dont I might have
romantic ones though

EDWARD
Well I might not be a poetic man
but I know that

AURORA
(interrupting)
Dont be so sure
EDWARD
Huh
AURORA

How long since youve tried to

‘be romantic If you could manage
it I might think about things
like Tahiti

She rises from her chaise and leans over to examine
her flowers Even with her back to a man there is
something flirtatious about her

ON EDWARD

Hes suspicious of the offer but decides to attempt
collaring a muse for the first time in his life

EDWARD
Aurora

AURORA
Hmmm

EDWARD

The breeze just caught a wisp of
your hair It was lovely to see

AURORA smiles tightly--at least he tried

EDWARD
(emboldened as he lcoks at her ass)
I imagine if I could see your eyes
now the sunlight would be reflecting
their color
AURORA is puzzled by this one She turns to question it
and sees that EMMA has been standing there watching

EMMA
Mary Martin Youre crazy if you

Texas troopers have gone crazy Flap

department where a trooper was
following him so he swallowed his

EMMA
(sobbing)
Oh Patsy give me a break

There is a knock on the door

AURORAS VOICE
Emma

Instantly the two girls part and grab four aerosol cans
and spray the room a can in each hand

AURORAS VOICE
Open the door

EMMA
You cant come in

AURORAS VOICE
What do you mean

EMMA
(to Patsy)
What the hell Im getting married

She opens the door The marijuana cigarette in her
mouth PATSY hysterical in the background

EMMA
What is it Mom

AURORA
(annoyed)
Oh really I need to talk to you

We hear her walk away EMMA is curious and a bit
apprehensive

PATSY
Maybe shes going to tell you how
to have sex 14
EMMA
Shes only an expert on how to
avoid it
(Patsy laughs)
Oh I shouldnt say things like

that I didnt mean it
she bites her tongue
INT DOWNSTAIRS AREA - NIGET 15

To show EMMA a bit wobbly pause near the living room
getting the small pulse of pleasure she always receives
from taking in the original Klee painting which hangs
prominently there--a few sharply angled lines some
black some grey and some red

INT AURORAS ROOM 16

AURORA sitting under her favored painting--that small
Renoir of two handsome women wearing hats and downs
She looks crim

AURORA
Would you want me to be silent
about something thats for your
own good even if it might hurt
a little

EMMA
Yes maam I sure would

She dashes out closing the door behind her We hear
her laughing giddy--hicsh on life Texas weed and her
own wit AURORA is thrown by the totally unexpected
behavior She starts after EMMA who reappears still
having a great time

EMMA
What is it Momma I really would
like to get some sleep so I can
look halfway decent tomorrow

AURORA cant say what she has to in this atmosphere
Sulky and beleaguered she retreats to the comfort of
her window seat I looks out on her garden it is
soft and well-cushioned and safe
° EMMA
(babyinc her)
Come on what is it

i-
u

16

She moves to join her AURORA looks at her examining
her daughters face liking the eyes the round cheeks
distressed with the limp hair

AURORA

I was sitting here trying to
concentrate on what wedding gift
to get you

(Emma waits her out)
For a second I thought of my
mothers Renoir

(Emma waits)
So Ive been trying--trying to
ignore tke truth

(launching in)
I am totally convinced that your
getting married to Flap Horton
tomorrow is a mistake of such
proportions that it would cripple
your destiny and make wretched
your life

EMMA doesnt know what hit her

AURORA
Flap is limited he has no
imagination Even at this ace
all he wants is a secure teaching
job Hes not that attractive
his teeth

EMMA
You dont know anything about me
Shut upjust shut up or Ill get
you back Just how can you do this
to me now How can you How can
you How can you How can you

AURORA
Because Im your mother and I know
youre not special enough to
overcome a bad marriage

EMMA
(shocked--crazy mad)
Oh Oh Oococ0eo Im going to
get you back

AURORA
Will you stop taking what Im
saying personally Use your brain
Im telling you the truth

16 16

EMMA
I can get you on your looks Youre
so worried about aging--well
You know your necks losing shape

RURORAS remarkable gifts for self preservation come
into play with muscles never before needec nor
flexed she moves to stifle her daughters rage

AURORA
No You will not do this

EMMA
Im not that scared of you You
know your rear end

AURORA
No I mean it This is a crossroads
for us Dont make a mistake Do
you want to stay my daughter or not

Almost literally AURORA is shoving her daushers words
back down her throat Wills lock only briefly before
EMMAS gives way

EMMA
(calmer)
Youre just so awful to me

AURORA
Thats more like it

EMMA
Thank God for Flap Horton for
getting me out of here

She starts out then wheels on her mother

EMMA
If this is your attitude I dont
think you should bother to come
to the wedding

AURORA
I think youre right The hypocrisy
was bothering me too

EMMA exits in disbelief

Eva
My own mothers not coming to my
wedding

AURORA

Now I suppose youre mac at me

EXT AURORAS STREET DAY 17

A yellow 69 XKE convertible its top down is forced
to move slowly behind a beer delivery truck In the
truck are ROSIE and her husband ROYCE In the car are
GARRETT BREEDLOVE and an 18-year-old girl GARRETT is

a once famous astronaut for the United States of America
He is in his mid 40s and sexy Hes an easygoing over-
achiever who truly believes that life can be simple and
fun GARRETT and his date are hung over from a night

of carousing

ANGLE ON AURORA 18

In a housedress as she stands barefoot on her front

lawn a garden tool in hand She is looking with
undisguised contempt at the former national hero as he
pulls into the driveway immediately adjacent to her own
as ROYCE steers his truck into AURORA’S driveway It
conceals BREEDLOVES car from our view AURORA quickly
shifts her attention to ROSIE as she steps from the truck

ROSIE
No matter what my kids do to me
I hope Im never such a stump as
to not be at their wedding

AURORA
They dont seem to have weddings--
they just have christenings dont
they

ROSIE
Dont get me pissed at you Youre
having a hard enough time

AURORA nods a bit downcast

ROSIE
(continuing)
Just do me a favor and give me a
while before I have to feel sorry
for you

AURORA
How was it

ROSIE
Let me get changed and Ill tell
you everything

“ROYCE has gotten down from the truck and hovers into

view His beer belly is fabulous--the buckle of his
belt pointing straight down to the ground

is

18

ROSIE
(disgusted)
Oh Royce wanted you to see
him dressed up

she looks at him

ROYCE
(loving Auroras attention)
I just wanted to say congratulations
and that the bride looked almost as
pretty as her momma

AURORA
Thank you Im pleased you dropped
by

ROYCE

Im pleased that I did too Good-
bye then

ROSIE starts for the house loathing ROYCE for finding
AURORA so attractive ROYCE backs the truck up
revealing GARRETTS XKE He and the young woman have
passed out in the car their heads laying together the
girls hand resting on his crotch There is a NASA
Sticker in the window shield AURORA takes in this
picture post card from the second level of hell and
then advances on the car She taps the young blonde
girl gently on the shoulder

AURORA
MissMiss

The hungover girl mumbles incoherently--the chain
reaction to AURORAS pushing her shoulder is to have
the girls hand jiggle the mans privates

AURORA
(shaking harder)
Young womanyoung woman
(to man)
Child molester

GIRL
(mumbling sexily as she feels him)
Uh-oh here goes the rocket

AURORA shocked shakes her violently The girls eyes

open and focus on this angry woman old enough to be
her mother 18

AURORA
Listen carefully Youve passed
out in a good neighborhood this
time Wake him up and get him
inside But give me a second
So far Ive avoided meeting him
and Id like to keep it that way

As she moves to her house
EXT FLAP AND EMMAS HOME - THAT NIGHT 19

This is a garage apartment in the area around Rice
University--poor housing to some--a find to graduate
students of which FLAP HORTON is one There are stairs
leading up to the door and an area at the top of the
stairs with just enough room for a somewhat rusty
porch swing Houston is built on a swamp It is
tropical the air is extraordinarily sensual and for
EMMA sitting outside on one of those humid fracrant
summer nichts is part of what being Houstonian is all
about So she sits here now with her new husband still
halZ dressed in the clothes they were married in a bit
runk from champagne with their belongings inside
awaiting the setting up of housekeeping if energy ever
strikes Their clothes are dirty from the porch They
ze somewhat sweaty as they eat from a Kentucky Colonel
carton FLAP finishing off some corn-on-the-cob FLAP
is 23 and looks like a nice guy

EMMA
Im glad we didnt try to doa
honeymoon

The phone begins ringing

EMMA
Shes going crazy Ill make
her wait till noon tomorrow
Thats about all she could take

FLAP
Youre totally justified to stay
clear away from her forever

EMMA
Oh she just came apart because
was leaving and she was feeling
More alone

Hw

i9

FLAP
(as if to a simpleton)
Emma your mother boycotted your
wedding She hates your husband and
she only holds you in medium esteem

EMMA
Medium esteem--youre so cute

FLAP stands and helps her up finishing some corn-on- 20
the-cob She gives him a little kiss and hand-in-hand
they walk across their threshold Books are stacked

in piles most of them paperbacks As they move

past the stacks

EMMA
Wouldnt it have been strange if
one of us married someone who
idnt like to read And there
must be millions of interesting
people in the world who just dont
like to read I feel so totally
gooé about us I hope I get
pregnant tonight

FLAP
It would be nice I love the
way you look Youre so nice
and round

Now FLAP osses his corn away and embraces her in
good-natured sexuality and moves her towards the
mattress lying on the floor without boxspring

EMMA
(between kisses)
The only thing I dont like
about sex is that it always
means the end of a conversation

Now they go at it on the mattress the windows open
lamps on at the other end of the room provide illumi-
mation When FLAP gets horny it would never occur
to him to close doors or shut out lights But he
pauses for some atypical foreplay kisses her body
touches her they grin at each other

EMMA
(impressed with his foreplay)
Well arent we being leisurely
tonight

20

She holds his head to her chest gives it a sudden
squeeze Then a wave of tenderness as he begins to
kiss her friendly buds The phone finally after
some 35 rings stops

EMMA
Its just a shame that my mothers
too arrogant to ever admit how
‘wrong she was about you and how
lovely and wonderful you are

But now she pauses because the SOUND of FLAP sucking
the corn from his teeth between kisses of her breast
is Gistracting her

ON FLAP 21

Pausing over the breast making the noise thats
somewhere on the graph between annoying and plain
disgusting His nose wrinkled in concentration as
he tries to suck loose another kernel He finally
does and busies himsel‘ once more with EMMAS breast
then feels her staring down at him

EMMA
(swatting him)
What are you deing
He realizes suddenly and they both laugh
FLAP
(embarrassed and pleased
with himself)
Come on its not that terrible
He picks at his teeth A kernel of corn falls to
EMMAS breast as she flicks it away
EMMA
Flap for Gods sake Whats
the opposite of romantic
EXT EMMAS APT - MORNING 22

From the record player we hear Ethel Merman and
Russell Nype singing I Hear Music” from “Call Me Madam

INT EMMAS APT DAY 23

EMMA and FLAP have just finished having sex again

23

FLAP
That is the strangest music to
have sex to

- EMMA
I know

He smiles and reaches next to him for a paperback book
The phone starts ringing from the kitchen FLAP makes
a sour face EMMA decides to answer it Scampering
from the bed she is wearing one of FLAPS T-shirts and
nothing else

INT EMMAS KITCHEN - NIGHT 24
EMMA picks up the phone

EMMA
(into phone)
Im not ready to forgive you
Im happy--leave me alone I
dont want to talk now

She starts to hang up then reconsiders

EMMA

(continuing)
Oh did you see the table cloth
Rosie made me Oh its beautiful
No not yet I thought omelettes
No Ill do them sort of Tex-Mex
I dont feel like talking now No
I mean it That was the worst thing
you ever did to me

FLAP comes padding in shirtless zipping up his jeans
as EMMA sees him

EMMA
(continuing into phone)
Well I think you owe my husband an
apology Well until you do tell
it to my husband Im not going
to listen to any of your gossip
Hes right here

FLAP gestures he wants no part of the phone EMMA mimes
that he must do this He shakes his head Finally she
wins the silent debate FLAP taking the phone EMMAS
concentration on his end of the conversation is
extraordinary

FLAP
(into phone)
Hello Mrs GreenwayNo maam
Im not enjoying your predicament

EMMA
(shouting towards phone)
Momma be nice Im not kidding

PLAP
(overriding her)

As a matter of fact I dont need
or desire an apology All I want is
for you to understand and appreciate
my position to respect our marriace
and to maybe wait another 15 minutes
before you call in the morning

(he grins)
Yes I guess Ive saic my piece
Okay I11 put her on

EMMA gives him a big kiss Takes the phone

EMMA
Hi Isnt he great

motley group of spent revelers saying goodbye to him

at the door He accepts their embraces while holding

a waste basket full of empty liquor bottles in the

other hand Now he restrains one girl bidding her

to stay she nods acquiescence She waits for him
while he happily goes around to the side of the house--
the driveway adjoining AURORAS--removes the lid from one
of his main garbage cans to empty his container into it

behind her EMMA feeling natural For her the episode
with ROSIE was not particularly special but PATSY as
happens to her with some frequency in this friendship
feels shallow next to EMMA There is a half-beat of
alienation as PATSY walks alongside her

She stalks out the side door leading to the front yard

AURORA walks the lawn barefooted under the stars 60

‘This moment staggers her She moves into a darker

area so that we can just see her but we hear her
sighing collecting herself Suddenly she is illumi-
natec by headlights as a long Lincoln pulls in the
bordering driveway

ANGLE ON CAR

As it stops We see that GARRETT is in the Passenger
seat sitting beside two beautiful and beautifully

60

dressed young women They are almost as young as the
girls weve seen him with earlier but there is a great
difference They are privileged upper strata young
women The world owes them a living and it has shown
avery intention of paying up

DORIS
Do you need some help
GARRETT
Ill let you know after I stretch

my legs

He opens the car door and falls flat on his face He
laughs DORIS leans out the window She has obviously
had her hands full with him for a good part of the evening

DORIS
(leaning out the window)
Youre bleeding

GARRETT
Thats okay Come inside

DORIS
No thank you

GARRETT
Safety in numbers

DORIS

AURORA has almost forgotten herself and her probiems to
take a few steps closer where she stands taking every-
thing in

DORIS
Afraid

GARRETT
Well then Doris why not come in

DORIS
Because youre much older than the
boys I date because youre drunk
because when I went there tonight

DORIS (CONTD)
to prowl after us all night long
I expected a hero not some silly
flirt who has to keep his jacket
open because his bellys getting
too big

LEE ANNE
Youd better tend to that cut

The car moves off He grovels about trying to get tc

can Instead it tips over Garbage is on him he is
bleeding considerably gruntine in genuine pain that
has sobered him instantly as the heavy metal cans
crashed against his head Now AURORA steps out He
sees her

overheard An awkward pause then

I think we both know Im not old
enough to need a welcome wagon

thinking there was nobody I could
take Because everybody I flew

with their wives would have given

me bitch bites up and down my back
if I showed up with one of my regular
girls and I dont know anyone their
age And then I thought I could
ask my next door neighbor

She looks at him with astonishment

GARRETT
(continuing easily)
Then they canceled the evening But
I was really going to ask you out
for a minute there In spite of
everything Isnt that a shocker

AURORA
Sure Imagine you having a date with
someone where it wasnt necessarily
a felony

GARRETT
(having fun)

patronizing when she actually feels terrified and 16
years old

76

(dripping sex)
Now since youve agreed lets save
the rest of it I know how you feel
There were countdowns when I had
second thoughts But I figured

powerful than yourself you might as
well look forward to the ride

AURORA
Im not going Theres really
something wrong with you

She half-runs to the house GARRETT chuckles

excitement This far away from her mother there comes

a vague feeling of extra power a kind of maturity

and boxes She stops at TOMMYS door then deliberately
catches herself and stops hersel from entering As

she walks back to her own room

DISSOLVE TO
SAME HOUSE - SIX MONTHS LATER 81

Some furniture has been purchased the place homey
Notably different from Houston as FLAP has moved —
from poor student to poorer teacher his furnishings
have kept pace We are looking at TOMMY who is taking
on the sophistication of an aging toddler We HEAR
FLAP and EMMAS conversation from their bedroom as
does TOMMY who is not especially interested They
are talking in loud whispers

FLAPS VOICE
I have eight or nine papers lett
to grade--this isnt love its
selfishness

EMMAS VOICE
Its been almost a week since weve
been together Weve never gone a
whole week

INT HORTONS BEDROOM 82

EMMA in bed pulling her dressed husbands arm Even
though they each have conflicting priorities at this
moment this is more fun than argument The reason —
they are whispering is apparent in the background
where we see EMMAS old crib holding her baby TEDDY

FLAP
Sure weve gone a week
EMMA
(releasing him)
Only during the real pregnant months
Forget it Just do me a favor Dont

make me feel silly and I wont make
you feel guilty

FLAP
Fair enough I have to hurry

INT HORTONS OUTER ROOM 83
As FLAP gives his son a kiss on the way out

FLAP
Be a good boy

TOMMY watches his father leave then watches his mother
enter from the bedroom She is blowing her nose having
just cried a bit TOMMY is about to speak then HEARS the

noise of his father returning FLAP takes EMMA by the hand

FLAP
Lets hurry
EMMA
(gleeful)

I absolutely love that you came
back I absolutely love it you
have no idea I feel like youve
saved our lives

(to Tommy)
Well have breakfast in a minute
honey

The becgroom door closes behind them TOMMY walks to
the door and outside

EXT HORTONS HOUSE - DAY 84

As TOMMY sits on the steps we HEAR the faint sounc of
a womans squeak

DISSOLVE TO
SAME SCENE - FIVE YEARS LATER 85

TOMMY is now ten TEDDY is five and wearing at least
part of the outfit we saw on TOMMY in the previous
scene They are sitting in front of the house and
HEARING the off-stage argument their parents are having

FLAPS VOICE
I dont know why you dont get a job
if youre so worried about money

EMMAS VOICE
What am I going to do with the boys

FLAPS VOICE
Its supposed to be a great day when
you get tenure

EMMAS VOICE
We dont have enough money to pay
the bills now All tenure means is
we wont have enough money forever

85

TOMMY begins to walk off

TEDDY
Mommy said to wait right here

° TOMMY
You stay if you want

TEDDY is torn reluctant to disobey his mother but
unable to resist scurrying after his brother

As they move down the block

FLAPS VOICE
Then I dont see why you cant
ask your mother for money

The boys are both upset TEDDY seeking camaraderie
TOMMY withdrawn

TEDDY
Tommy

TOMMY
I dont want to talk

TEDDY
What do you want to do

TOMMY
(flaring out)
How about punching each other i
the stomach and seeing who can hit
harder You want to do that

TEDDY looks at him isappeinted There is a half-
second attempt to stare him down then

TEDDY
Maybe later

EMMA comes out of the house in the distance distraught
looks up and down spots her kids and comes marching
towards them TEDDY sees her and runs towards her
hugging her hard She hugs him back She is 30 years
old and obviously distraught She comforts TEDDY and
eyes TOMMY who has refused to budge

EMMA
Im sorry we had a fight but its
over now
TOMMY nods

(CONTINUEL)

EMMA

(continuing)
I told you to wait out front though
Whyd you go down here Answer me

Tommy

”

TOMMY
(challenging)
I didnt want people to think we
lived there

EMMA is made more angry than guilty by the remark
EMMA
Okay Well let you say one really
mean thing to your mother each year
So thatll do till youre eleven

TOMMY
Youre driving Daddy away

EMMA
Dont make me hit you on the street

They walk to the car

EMMA

He nudges TOMMY to join in the lobbying but TOMMY
though dying for anything with the word Texas
attached remains aloos

EMMA
Why not Its a good time for a treat

She takes some frozen shrimp reacts to the high price
and drops it in her basket

TEDDY

88

TOMMY gestures he should take it a bit more calmly
His brothers exuberance embarrasses him

SAM BURNS a man in his early 50s stands there 90

bag he carried under his arm with a great desire

to rescue EMMA from embarrassment Its not the

sort of thing he does well

the contact

EMMA

SAM

to walk away She blocks his path

EMMA

(quietly to him)
If you are doing something and youre
trying fo make me feel like Im crazy
because I am bearing our child then
you may have just sunk to a point so
low you may never recover You may
have just panicked Flap and trying
to save yourself you have thrown out
your character and principles The
only way you can possibly redeem
yourself and be the man God intended
you to be is to take the responsibility
and admit anything that you may have
been doing tonight I£ you dont do
that now--right now--you are a lost
man a shell a bag of shit dust

FLAP is uncertain EMMAS gaze is unwavering then

TOMMY The BANKER is finishing reading a poem he

wrote especially for the evening while AURORA busies

herself licking the icing from some of the burnt out
candles

BANKER
And so another birthday for a gal
named Aurora Greenway
Even though 50 she still takes my
breath away
Mere mortals just gaze as she lights
up their sky
A heavenly object--a sirens cry

The poem has come from his heart He looks at her

emotionally to tell everyone your ace

ROSIE has entered with more coffee She is enjoying
AURORAS predicament

VERNON

it does

AURORA
(to Rosie)
Hes still talking about it

ROSIE

DR RATCHER
Damn it--Im trying to do some
good here The way to adjust to
old ace is

DOCTOR the PATHETIC BANKER--slim pickings

104 ON AURORA 104

As she looks across at the astronauts house through
the side window we get a glimpse of his moving from
view apparently cooking Now with sudden and
extraordinary purpose she runs across the lawn to
his door where she rings the bell Waits then
nervously backs up several steps

GARRETTS VOICE
Yeah Be right there

104

She backs up some more so that she stands her ground
strangely in the shadows a good ten feet away when
GARRETT opens the door Hes in his 50s now His

face and body show it His blessing is that hes
hlissfully unaware of that fact He is wearing one of
those short velour bathrobes with nothing on underneath

ON GARRETT 105
At first he doesnt see her then does

AURORA
I was curious whether you still
wanted to take me to lunch

GARRETT

GARRETT

by the horn beep from the next car An incredibly
brief beep like a man coughing ever so slightly to
let someone know hes there EMMA looks over

EMMAS POV 109

SAM BURNS getting out of his car trying not to show the
strain of being more nervous than hes been inever
His grin is too wide He is shrugging with his face

a sort of helpless gesture of raising his eyebrows

ané ears Hes a lucky man for he is approaching one
ef the few women around who would find his machinations
endearing

The scarf flies off and her carefully created mane whips
wildly in the air

kids with ketchup on their faces but there is a knotty
pine bar in the back which is where we find SAM BURNS
and EMMA They are holding hands in the shy manner of
decent people preparing for mortal sin SAM is being
overwhelmed by both his good fortune and inner guilt
He is between a rock and a soft place

SAM BURNS
You know the thing I didnt expect
was that there would be moments where
I forget to be scared someone will
see us together

plating it too I didnt know that

walks to her window and opens it

Over the fence she can see GARRETT doing laps in his pool
129 AURORA 129

Taking a bit of her eclair and then throwing it into a
waste basket She is experiencing the first gnawing
staces of an anxiety threatening to escape and ravage
her after decades of quiet She crosses to a dresser
and searches for a particular nightgown finds it

She sits nightgown on her lap and goes through the
phone book She writes down a number which she finds
all the while throuch the open window we HEAR GARRETT
doing his laps She takes off one earring and tosses
her head a bit to get the receiver just right before
dialing The phone rings until eventually we hear
the SOUND of laps stop We hear the muffled voice of
GARRETT at the other end saying Hello

AURORA

(her voice not behaving)
Hello Garrett I was just sitting
here realizing that Id never shown
you my Renoir Would you care to
come over and see my Renoir Oh

(suddenly uncertain)
If I dont answer the bell the back

129 -

She hangs up holds herself briefly The excitement so
great that its unwelcome She stancés and crosses to
the bathroom more frightened than she expected

We remain in the bedroom area where we HEAR the rustle
df satin and then the doorbell ring

AURORAS VOICE
Oh my--he ran it

She rushes from the bathroom dressed in her nightgown

and carrying a largish mirror which she sets up near the
door GARRETT will soon enter Now she turns off the
light moves quickly back to the doorway of the bathroom
and poses backlit in the doorway trying to make out her
image The nightgown is simple and sexy Then we HEAR
GARRETT on the stairs She rushes across the room

takes the mirror back inside the bathroom There is

a knock on the bedroom door AURORA enters wearing a
bathrobe over her nightgown

AURORA
Garrett

GARRETTS VOICE
Sure

She opens the door He is wearing wet swimming trunks
GARRETT
(apologetically)

I was doing laps when you called
Lucky for you Id only done eight

He grins at her She turns her back on him and looks
up at the painting as he approaches from behind He
puts his hands on her shoulders

GARRETT
I like the painting I like
everything in here
(into her ear)
Relax baby its going to be great

She wheels on him sputtering in indignation feeling
genuinely and deeply reduced and insulted

AURORA
Just who do you think youre talking
to like this Don’t you realize
Im a grandmother

Ane with that she takes his face and gives him a stunning
open-mouthed expert kiss They break He is staggered

BS 129

AURORA
Its not flattering if you look
too surprised Just give me a
minute

Her self-image buoyed by her own actions she moves
towards the bathroom pausing to scoop up a perfume
atomizer from her dresser

GARRETT waits a hand reaches around to turn off the
light and then we see AURORA as she posed earlier
backlit and intriguing

GARRETT
I like the lights on

AURORA
Then go home and turn them on

He accepts her conditions and stands waiting in the
shadows She moves towards the bed In the darkness
we can see him stepping out of his elasticized swim
trunks hopping a bit as he fails to release the
second leg smoothly while AURORA turns back the covers
and slips inside He joins her under the covers

GARRETT
This is the softest mattress Ive
ever been on

AURORA
Well coming from you
(then a whispered secret)
I always like to splurce on bedding

We hear a rustle and see him start to move with enormous
enercy

AURORA
No
(a small kiss)
Lets lie still for a while

AURORA
(easily)

Well I think its sad that you
think you need this to impress
girls

GARRETT
(angrily)
Need it Sometimes it isnt enough
I dont think theres a thing wrong
with using all your assets

AURORA
Except it turns your profession
into a sex trap

GARRETT
Oh come on We all use whatever
we have TI earned it Its as
much a part of me as anything
else

AURORA
I didnt realize I was tripping
over such a deeply felt principle

GARRETT

(agitated)
Man how many men have you hac to
step on to get on that high a
horse But youre not so different

very soon what it was like out in

than being out in a field in west

you keep thinking how far away you

challenged loved He is talking about himself in

the manner of a hungry man having his first meal in
months She is as he will later comment a girl you
can really talk to

GARRETT
You know what bothers me None of

us ever got together one night closed
all the doors and compared notes on
the experience Youd swear there
was a rule that we had to pretend

it wasnt the fun that it was--that

if we started saying just how much fun
it was they wouldnt let anybody go

up anymore I even got a little
talking to for laughing through a
transmission once

AURORA
(fascinated)
Keep talking

145 145

GARRETT
And you do sense the speed I
remember looking out the window

(catching himself)

Im like somebody with a belly
telling stories about Korea
AURORA makes a motion that he should stop that stuff
and continue

GARRETT

(continuing)
Anywayat this one point I could
see part of the spacecraft and tell
that its whistling across the ground
but it doesnt make a sound so that
the one thing you can hear the only
noise in the world is your heartbeat
Its indescribable or I just cant
tell it better--but that was my moment-
the one that doesnt go away You
know what I mean

AURORA
Yes This is my moment

As they move around to the back of the wagon and tug
at an old childs mattress of EMMAS which they have
packed for love making

EMMA

You sort of get into the habit of
the phone ringing at 800 AM sharp
Its almost as if the things happening
to me now arent official because she
hasnt given me the business over them yet

20s a colleague They are under a street light

The girl has her hand up to FLAPS face They are

Clearly lovers Her name is JANICE

154 EMMA 154

Her suspicions confirmed The truth jolts her and
turns her mean She advances on the couple with the
stealth of Indians and wronged plump women

155 EMMAS POV 155
Now she is close enough to make out murmured voices

JANICE
Will you please please please
please stop telling me this is
just a crush

As he turns and begins to run after his outraged wife

and we SEE for the first time that he has their beautiful
baby in a pouch over his chest The baby is making it
enormously difficult for FLAP to catch up with EMMA
because he has to keep his hand on MELANIE to keep her
from bouncing around tco much Though net long--this

is our chase scene

little look back at her husband and child She slows
looks again stops and faces FLAP

EMMA
Stop jiggling her Shes going
to throw up

FLAP slows to a walk catches his breath EMMA walks
quickly and ignores FLAP while checking out the baby
strapped to his body

FLAP
Your timing was great You caught
us before we did anything

EMMA looks at him briefly and contemptuously He has
insulted her intelligence

EMMA
Give me the baby

She starts yanking at the pouch straps

EMMA
(aifficulty with straps)
Im taking the car Im taking
the kids and going to Houston

FLAP
You dont know if I did anything

EMMA
I know what you did and why You
did it to forget youre a failure

Thats your mother talking

EMMA overwrought now holds MELANIE in both hands and 161
gestures with the infant as if it were her hand

EMMA
(pointing baby at hersel‘)
Thats me talking

FLAP

You dont know what I did with her

(slyly)

I dont know what you do when youre

out on your afternoon drives

EMMA rolls her eyes as if having heard the most
preposterous sentence she has ever suffered

With that she walks off and

a few years younger than EMMA is in one of the rooms

a bit too big and gawky Her name is MELBA

Hi
EMMA
Hi
AURORA nods
MELBA
(to Emma)

You going to be in here

EMMA
Uh-huh My names Emma

MELBA
Im Melba Lanke My husband Dick

DR MAISE walks in He nods to AURORA then draws
the curtain separating EMMAS area from MELBAS

DR MAISE
Excuse us a moment

ON MELBAS AREA 215
AURORA and EMMA now shut off from view

215 -

DR MAISE
Melba there are certain options
you have to consider on the kind
of treatment well be following
We need to decide whether to operate

MELBA
What do you think Dr Maise

DR MAISE
Well the problem is that if we
dont operate the chances are
one in four of achieving a cure
But if we operate the chances
of a cure become one in two

MELBA
(heartened)
Oh

DR MAISE
But the chances of surviving
the operation are two in three

MELBA
Oh So if we just keep on doing
what were doing my chances are
one in three

DR MAISE
(correcting)
One in four
MELBA
One in four--sorry
DR MAISE
Thats okay
MELBA

Whats one in three

DR MAISE
There is no one in three The
chances of surviving the operation
are two in three

MELBA
(trying)
One in three if we dont do any

DR MAISE

(patiently correcting)
One in four 215

MELBA
Why do I keep getting that wrong
One in four if we dont do anything

DR MAISE
Right

MELBA
(encouraged)
Two of three if I have the operation

DR MAISE
(coaching)
But

MELBA
(she knows this one)
the chances of surviving the
operation are one in two

DR MAISE
Thats right

MELBA laughs a bit flushed with her success at having
gotten it down DR MAISE opens the curtain separating
the two areas EMMA and AURORA agape MELBA looking
over at them as soon as the doctor exits

MELBA

INT PLEASURE DOME - NIGHT 218

A monument to a certain type taste It has a giant
indoor area with a sweating indoor pool some matted
and torn artificial turf serving as a miniature golf
course ping-pong tables shuffleboard and scores of
pinball machines all of it covered by a plastic top
creating an eerie translucence Most of the rooms at
this Holiday Inn have balconies facing out on the
Pleasure Dome So it is a weary AURORA we see climb
up to the balcony and open the door to one of these
rooms

her armpit periodically EMMA is in bed She is

I cant believe you did this

AURORA
Sure
(to men)
Be careful Those paintings are
worth more than youll make in your
lifetime

The men turn and react

INT EMMAS ROOM DAY 223

EMMA lying in bed the doctor sitting at her bedside
EMMA looking intelligent and relaxed despite the
doctors words His manner is not the least bit
emotional A professional rendering facts

DR MAISE
The response to the drugs weve
tried isnt what wed hoped But
there are investigatory drugs which
we are willing to utilize However
if you become incapacitated or it
becomes unreasonable for you to
handle your affairs for a block of
time it might be wise to make some
ecisions now so that your areas of
responsibility dont become notably
disordered

dribbles down her chin Absently she wipes the water away

AURORA
You dont have the resources

FLAP
You cant make an argument out of this

She is growing angry and trying not to She sips some
water it runs down her chin The problem of getting water
to stay in her mouth is beginning to vie for her attention

AURORA
Raising three children and working
full time and running after women
requires a lot more energy than you
have Youve always had a knowledge
of your own weakness--dont lose that
quality now that you need it most

She sips and dribbles FLAP rises watches AURORA dab
at her chin

You have no right nor any invitation

between them As they relax this visit becins to have

EMMA
You didnt fail me

FLAP
Lets not talk about this I feel
like Im sucking after forgiveness--

You werent any more terrible than me

FLAP
Except for the cheating

EMMA

Oh lets not do this We had our

problems Flap but it wasnt over

whether we loved each other

Oh look I didnt even notice
(she fingers his tie moved
by the gesture he made in
wearing it)

Honestly Oh gosh And it was

some of the elements of a good time

The house still isnt in one piece
It was in the last box I looked in

EMMA
Ill bet

Youre so easy to please I dont

I never thoucht I was the sort of
man whod give up his kids

EMMA
I dont think you want that much

up wishing it were that easy

EMMA

Shes not so bad

EMMA

research summers in New York

No Patsy only really cares about
Melanie I want them with Mother

them and have them and help decide
things for them

FLAP sighs

EMMA
Id let you But Teddy cant spare her

PATSY pauses She always adores the way EMMA thinks
She is heavyhearted but is working against the emotion
trying to supply energy to her friends hospital room

PATSY
I suppose Melanie will manage all by
herself no matter who takes care of her

not to need me for years but Teddys
going to be so scared without me

As TOMMY and TEDDY enter their mothers room TOMMY
steeling himself his younger brother already in tears
He moves quickly to his mother and buries his head in
the covers TOMMY is enormously uncomfortable and rigid
TEDDY is a bit out of control because suddenly here
with his mother he feels comfortable enough to say

what hes been thinking since she was hospitalized

TEDDY
I love you and I miss you And
oh God I want you to come home

He lifts his head and takes some breaths EMMA pets
him looks almost a bit stern at TOMMY and gestures
him to come closer

ON TOMMY 248

As he hesitates for half a beat then walks to the

EMMA
You both look so gigantic to me
And I must look pretty bad to you

TEDDY is so shocked with her appearance he cant
answer just look embarrassecé TOMMY shows a small
measure of grace

TOMMY
Not so bad

ON EMMA 249
Strangely she feels deep appreciation for TOMMYS words

‘EMMA
You both need a haircut You have
both of you beautiful eyes and I
want people to see them I dont
care how long it gets in back but
clip those bangs Theyre too long

TOMMY
Thats a matter of opinion

EMMA
Just keep the hair out of your eyes

TOMMY
Are you setting well

EMMA
Uh-uh

TEDDYS eyes dart as if looking for escape

EMMA

(continuing)
-eIm sorry about this But I cant
help it And I cant talk to you too
much longer or else Ill start to
get real upset But we had lots of
years and we did a lot of talking--
and some people dont get that
Listen I want you to make a lot of
friends And dont be afraid of

Why dont you just shut up

TOMMY
(half-heartedly)
You shut up
EMMA
Shhh Come on Teddy Give me

a kiss

They kiss on the lips TEDDY kisses her a few extra
times and so does she She does the last extra

kisses in a way which makes him smile She gestures
to TOMMY who kisses her cheek cuickly He is tortured
and somehow being stiff and foul is simpler for him
right now

EMMA
Tommy be sweet Be sweet please
Dont keep pretending you dislike
me Thats silly

TOMMY
(strained)
I like you 249 -
EMMA

Then will you listen to me especially
hard

TOMMY
What

EMMA
Youll listen close

TOMMY
I said what

EMMA

(petting his arm)
I know that you like me I know it
But for the last year or two youve
been pretending you hate me I love
you a let as much as I love anybody
as much as I love myself And in
a few years when I havent been
around to be on your tail about
something or irritating you youre
going to remember my buying your
baseball glove when you thought
we were too broke and how I read
you these stories and let you goof
off instead of mowing the lawn
lots of things Youre coing to
realize you loved me And maybe
youre going to feel badly because
you never told me Dont Because
I already know you love me So you
must not ever do that to yoursel
Okay

TOMMY pauses His brother looking at him with hope
and urging that he says “I love you He doesnt

TOMMY
Okay

EMMA
Good Youd both better run alone
now Take care I was scared of
this but I think it went really
well dont you
