INT TOILET ROSEBOWL PASADENA NIGHT 1987
Yeah a toilet cubicle And yes 1987 1-9-8-7 The eighties

Graffiti’d walls Scribbled lyrics Eons of wisdom from Rock
Gods and hookers who have performed at the Marquee Club - the
likes of Jim Morrison Elvis and Hendrix

Right now Rock legend Joe Elliott from DEF LEPPARD is having
sex with a supermodel while composing lyrics on a wall He
turns to camera panting

JOE ELLIOTT

Urinal Vinyl Summer of 70 Swapped
Iron Butterfly for The Ramones
Enlightenment dawned

INT TOILET GAZZARRI’S SUNSET STRIP NIGHT Slash from Guns n Roses on the pan Two busty hookers kiss
and fondle each other while he drizzles Jack Daniels over

SLASH
Seventy-nine Baptism of fire
Swapped a soulless Sweet single for
Led Zep’s Tangerine Fuck NME or
Rolling Stone Those guys know
Jack You wanna get a musical

Slash takes a slug of JD and strums G-chord Perfectly tuned

SLASH (CONTD)
Only remember two khazies UV and
Christina Brinkley’s commode in
Manhattan while Billy was on tour
He may be an innocent man but that
girl knows a thing or two

HOOKER 1

the pan but the velvet tones of the King reach us anyway

ELVIS (VO)

Long live Urinal Vinyl

INT URINAL VINYL RECORD STORE NIGHT

HUNTINGTON BEACH Summer 1985 MATT late 20s scruffy
handsome laid-back cool looks away with the restraint of a
saint as a flustered tearful woman buttons up her blouse

Matt’s eyes betray a haunted man suffocating in the soul-
sapping shadow of the mountain of grief Her eyes just look
like shit - all puffy tear streaked and bloodshot

Note the above over-wordy description has been provided by
Matt’s best friend RAY

WOMAN
You and I it doesn’t mean I’ve
forgotten about Emma

MATT
I know

WOMAN
Four years is a long time

MATT
I know

Matt opens the shop door The woman takes the hint kisses
Matt then leaves

WOMAN
I’1l be waiting when you’re
ready

Matt locks her out then places a job advert in a window He
kills the lights leaving the shop eerily backlit

He lingers by the window staring out envious His POV the
vibrant sun-drenched music-stained streets of SO-CAL a
world he hasn’t been part of for years
Cherry Oct17 2011 3

Matt walks up to an oversized white porcelain urinal on a
platform lit by spotlights framed pics of Rock Stars posing
by the urinal on its base It has the aura of an altar a
place of worship

Matt kneels unlocks a hatch door and pulls out CRAP records

He takes the offending records to a sales counter He picks
up a phone snaps discs therapeutically as he dials Matt
puts on COME UP AND SEE ME by STEVE HARLEY AND COCKNEY REBEL

CD EMPORIUM (0S)
(an answer machine)
This is CD Emporium Our office
hours are 9 to 5 Please leave a
message and someone will contact
you during those hours

MATT
This is Matt Clay at Urinal Vinyl
leaving a message for Darren Osman
Regarding his third offer to buy me
out of my rental lease

Matt pauses waits for the song to hit the right lyrics

MATT (CONTD)

Youve done it all you’ve broken
every code And pulled the rebel to
the floor You spoilt the game no
matter what you say so kindly
tell Darren to go fuck himself and
his offer

(beat)
Sorry that last bit didn’t rhyme

Matt ends the call smiles then jogs up a shadowy staircase -

INT STAIRSFLAT ABOVE STORE SAME
- and nearly trips over a white cat asleep on the top step

MATT
How many times Jelly

Matt picks up JELLY scratches an ear They enter an open-
plan space - a weird mix of masculinefeminine walls covered
in framed photos and modern-art

The room’s dominant feature is WHITE LABEL records literally
thousands of them everywhere even wall-mounted One has a
PRESSED ROSE inside its sleeve

Matt swipes a mound of red-font final demand bills off a sofa
- utility bills bank loans invoices - and lowers Jelly
Cherry Oct17 2011 4

MATT (CONTD)
Sofas are for sleeping stairs are
for walking You hungry

Matt grabs a beer while he feeds Jelly Jelly purrs Matt
smiles He scratches an ear

He slumps on a sofa His eyes draw to a framed photo of a
stunning tanned girl posing beside an easel in a bikini

Close on the framed photo the beautiful girl paints a
picture of a gun shooting a heart

Pull back the picture dominates a wall impressive art

EMMA (0S)
Don’t be such a perv

Matt grins and heads into the bathroom -

INT BATHROOM LATER

- where his VAPOROUS almost TRANSPARENT DEAD GIRLFRIEND EMMA
is in a bath All we see of Emma is a tanned leg draped over
the side an ugly purple rash prominent on her smooth skin

EMMA (0S)
Another traitor bites the dust How
many does that make

MATT
Seventeen in four years

EMMA (0S)
Shame I liked her

MATT
She was your best friend

EMMA (0S)
Why do they always pick the
storeroom It’s not exactly
romantic

Matt shrugs
EMMA (CONTD) (0S)
Talking of romance Doctor Pimp
still trying to set you up with
Nurse Slut

Matt laughs then sits down on a toilet facing her

MATT
She’s not a slut she’s single
That hurt

Cherry Oct17 2011 5

EMMA (0S)

Sluts come in all shapes and
disguises You got rid of that
slimy Osman yet

MATT
No longer a problem

EMMA (0S)
And the bank

MATT
I said I’1l take care of the bank

EMMA (0S)
(sarcastic)

Like you said you’d take care of

me

Emma softens bitter to insecure in a heartbeat

EMMA (CONTD) (0S)
You haven’t told me you love me
today

MATT
I love you Today and always

EMMA (0S)

We don’t need them you know We
don’t need anybody We’re fine just
you and me Right here

INT ALLET PROPERTY SOLUTIONS DAY

Young impeccably dressed execs wielding Filofaxes pile
into a conference room and fight for position around a table

One exec CHARLIE BLAIR late 20s shoulder-length curly
blond perm piercing fyord blue eyes rushes into the room

She’s the embodiment of 80s go-get corporate professionalism
at least at face value but dig deeper and you find a woman
who can handle anything except real life emotions

Next her boss TODD early 40s strides in He’s a powerful
guy with a weak backbone He slides folders and Compact Discs
across a table at his minions

TODD
New client CD Emporium They
intend to sell millions of these
Compact Discs and they need prime
locations to do that from They’re
gambling vinyl records will be
obsolete within five years
Cherry Oct17 2011 6

One eager exec studies his folder and makes a comment

EXEC
Aggressive saturation numbers

TODD
That’s just southern California
These guys have enough private
equity support to roll out across
the country They’re targeting top
shelf brand recognition but given
the time frame they don’t have the
luxury of grass roots development
On pages 7 to 15 youll finda
list of every independent music
store operator in southern
California I need four out of
every ten of these to become CD
Emporium franchises by the end of
the month

CHARLIE
Impressive

TODD

Glad you agree You get Huntington
Beach the flagship Mike take
Costa Mesa Grant Santa Ana Vin
and Kelly can share Tustin and
Irvine Go get ‘em team

(beat as execs file out)
Charlie hang back a minute

INT CORRIDOR ALLET OFFICES LATER
Charlie walks beside Todd more into her assignment than him

TODD
Glasgow is a poisoned chalice The
head of CD Emporium grew up there
Must have been a messed up
childhood because he’s on some
nostalgic power trip to tear down
his old stomping ground and lay the
foundations to a new empire
Problem is tenant won’t budge
sitting on a freshly-inked three
year rollover Refused three rental
buy-out offers already

CHARLIE
You got a copy of the latest rental
agreement

TODD
Freeholder died a couple of months
ago

(MORE)
Cherry Oct17 2011 7

TODD (CONTD)
Kept everything in an office in his
house Apparently it got misplaced
during Estate removal

CHARLIE
Strategy without tactics is the
slowest route to victory

TODD
I wish I knew what the hell that
Chinese voodoo crap actually means

CHARLIE
It means that trio of stupid offers
has just made my job three times
more difficult

TODD
Make me look good I’1ll make you
look good to the partnership
committee

They walk in silence something else unresolved between them

TODD (CONTD)
We on for tonight

CHARLIE
You still having sex with your
wife

TODD

(a little too quickly)
It’s over I’m moving out as soon
as I find a suitable place

CHARLIE
Small detail but it’s important to
me

TODD
Tonight

CHARLIE
Book somewhere expensive and
discreet

TODD

How about we go for a drink first
Talk flirt a little

CHARLIE
How about we stick to food and
fornication Until the divorce
comes through
Cherry Oct17 2011 8

TODD
That’s it No emotion I feel like
I’m booking a hooker

CHARLIE
Book somewhere very expensive and
very discreet and Ill act like
one

Sorry Jane Got something for me

JANE

Near a tree by a river there’s a
hole in the ground where an old
man of Erin goes around and around
(beat baffled look)
Find that hole and go jump in it

Jane looks up at Charlie
Cherry Oct17 2011 9

JANE (CONTD)

Mr Clay is toying with me

INT ALLET PROPERTY SOLUTIONS OFFICE DAY

Charlie passes Todd in a corridor He flirtatiously meanders
toward her She walks straight

TODD
How’s Glasgow going

CHARLIE
No luck tracking down the paperwork
and the tenant refuses to talk to
me unless he’s quoting obscure
music lyrics

TODD
Wish I never asked What did the
freeholder’s solicitor say

CHARLIE
Tenant signed a three year
extension six months ago

TODD
Two and a half years

CHARLIE
Don’t worry Once I get my hands on
the rental agreement CD Emporium
won’t have to wait two and a half
months let alone two and a half
years

TODD
You better be right

Matt laughs He demonstrates another combo with the pads

MATT
More hips relax the shoulders

Phil copies the sequence whacking the pads breathing hard
Matt glances at Tommy who inexpertly punishes a heavy bag
with swinging lefts and rights fighting invisible demons

PHIL
And did I mention the body Tits

your beautiful sister

Matt shrugs in disbelief Phil just smirks digging deep

MATT
You take her out

PHIL
Your beautiful sister’d kill me
(lyrical as he punches)
I made the date for eight

Matt gets inside Phil’s guard and smacks him with the pads

MATT
I will never understand what my
sister sees in you

Matt lobs the pads at Phil climbs out of the ring Phil
towels down heads for the showers Matt joins Tommy He
studies his technique smiles Tommy ignores him

MATT (CONTD)
In your mind’s eye hit the bag a
few inches inside the leather

The kid turns to Matt one side of his face burn-scarred
angry red

TOMMY
I ask for advice

Matt smirks not bothered by the kid’s rudeness

MATT
A few inches inside the leather

stubs the fag out then turns sizing Matt up smiling warmly

MADDIE
Maddie How did you know it was me

Matt shrugs He speaks with such a lack of ulterior motive
Maddie knows instantly how she wants the night to end

MATT
I didn’t You looked like the
prettiest kindest most self-
assured woman in here I figured
you couldn’t possibly be single and
might not be offended if a stranger
offered to buy you a couple of
drinks so he wouldn’t have to go on
a horrendous blind date when a
couple of hours in the company of a
beautiful woman such as yourself
was a much more attractive option

MADDIE
Wow

The place is a shrine to Brazilian football and footballers

Photos banners flags everywhere walls covered

All except one wall which is covered with mugshots of non-

Romina applying lipstick walks over to Ray’s photo She
draws a red circle around number 3 -- element of surprise --

and number 7 -- thoughtful -- on the list below

INT RAY’S FLAT SAME

Ray sprays aftershave down his pants sniffs armpits and hand-

tests his breath

He kisses a photo of Romina stuck over the face of a
swimwear model on a poster Pull back to reveal the model is
racing other models waist-high in a sack over a finish line

A caption reads MALE WISH LIST CRACKING TITS AND GREAT IN THE SACK

INT MATT’S FLAT SAME

Charlie exit her apartment in a short dusty-yellow dress
and massive Dr Martins boots

She smiles nervously shocking herself as the briefest
flutter of butterflies hits the pit of her stomach

CHARLIE
I have no idea what to wear hunting
white label In fact I have no
idea what hunting white label is
If I look ridiculous tell me I
look amazing

To Matt amazing is an understatement He smiles honestly

MATT
Amazing would be an understatement

A lovely lingering silence as they look at each other

CHARLIE
So how do we do this

MATT
It’s usually a four-stage
operation But as you’re a novice
well stick to the first three
Eat drink and hunt

CHARLIE
Great I’m starving
Cherry Oct17 2011 47

MATT
I’ve booked a restaurant with the
best menu and most amazing view of
the ocean

Charlie looks down at her de-constructed look grimaces
MATT (CONTD)
Relax You might be a little

overdressed

Matt and Charlie walk down a street comfortably close

CHARLIE
So what exactly is white label
hunting

MATT

Unsigned bands don’t have recording
contracts so they have to cut
their own demos on vinyl or tape
They use them to promote their
music at gigs Kind of like a
calling card They’re called white
label because there’s no printing
on them just blank white labels
As they only cut a few any band
that makes it they become
collectors items The bigger the
band the more valuable the white

label

CHARLIE
What’s the most valuable one you’ve
got

MATT

(pang of self-loathing)
The one that means the most isn’t
worth a penny

EXT ROMINA’S APARTMENT NIGHT

Ray gets out of a stretch limo dressed in ordinary clothes
holding a bunch of cheap supermarket roses

Romina glides out of her apartment dressed in a figure-

EXT EXCLUSIVE VIEW RESTAURANT EVENING

The sun kisses the horizon Matt looks at Charlie as he buys
hamburgers from a street vendor on a pier walkway

He passes two drunk tramps ignoring the BEST VIEW in Southern
LA He gives them some coins then slouches down by Charlie
who rests her chin on railings admiring the view

Matt hands her a burger and a beer they eat in silence

CHARLIE
So this is the most amazing view in
Southern California

MATT
Second most amazing view

Matt points at the inebriated tramps one falls off a bench

MATT (CONTD)
I tried to bribe them but
apparently some locations just
arent for sale

Charlie winces at the irony reminded of her actions

CHARLIE
You always eat here

MATT
I used to come here with my wife
This was our place
(an awkward beat)
How about you Married

CHARLIE
I kind of went off guys for a
while

Charlie gazes at her dangling feet the memory an unpleasant
one

MATT
Sorry

CHARLIE
No big deal Usual story Girl
meets guy Girl falls in love with
guy gets pregnant guy fucks off
then girl has misca -
(stops herself another
awkward beat)
I kissed a prince and got a frog
(really painful silence)
So what do you want to do when you
grow up
Cherry Oct17 2011 49

MATT
Cure Meningitis invent time travel
and earn enough money to save my
father’s failing legacy of a record
store from becoming a soulless CD
franchise

CHARLIE
Jesus could either of us be more
depressing

A really really really awkward silence

CHARLIE (CONTD)
AIDS Famine Genocide Fascism

Matt smiles

Come on hunting while sober is
dangerous

INT BAR NIGHT

O’Malley’s Irish Bar and Pick-Up Joint Shamrocks and sliced
in-half American pick-ups where seats and tables should be

Matt leads Charlie to a 57 Chevy cab then heads to the bar
where OMalley a heavily-tattooed heavy-set biker-type with
a huge ZZ Top beard smiles and extends a hand

OMALLEY
(scratching his beard)
Fuck the hand
Cherry Oct17 2011 50

OMalley vaults the bar and bear-hugs Matt O’Malley looks at
Charlie He returns behind the bar and grabs some bottles of
beer then pours three shots and slides them towards Matt

OMALLEY (CONTD)
(slamming a shot)

To Emma the prettiest girl in

heaven And the only girl I ever

shaved for

O’Malley and Matt pick up the remaining shots and shoot in
silence O’Malley steals another look at Charlie

OMALLEY (CONTD)
Finally hunting again

MATT
Just a friend

O’MALLEY
Body language says different

MATT
What do you know about body
language

O’MALLEY
Obviously more than you Besides
you wouldn’t have brought her here
if she was just a friend Mind if I
put Emma’s favorite ZZ on Ease the
pain

MATT
You don’t need to do this

OMALLEY
Irish Catholic Can’t break
promises I shaved for Emma and I
said I’d shave her off when you
started hunting again So off she
will come You want the same
charity

MATT
(nods a yes)
No tears this time

OMALLEY
No shame in shedding a tear for an
angel

Matt nods lump in his throat O’Malley takes a dust-covered
fund-raising bucket off a shelf He wipes away cobwebs
revealing a label YOU FILL HER UP I’LL SHAVE HER OFF As
Matt walks off I NEED YOU TONIGHT by ZZ TOP starts
Cherry Oct17 2011 51

CHARLIE
The bartender’s crying

MATT
He’s going to lose something he’s
very attached to Literally and
figuratively
(beat suddenly sad)
A toast Here’s to happy hunting

CHARLIE
To happy hunting

Later when both are drunk

MATT
Come on we need to test your
mental and physical dexterity

INT STRETCH LIMO NIGHT

Ray and Romina in the limo’s rear having an awful time Ray
slugs champagne from a bottle then pours a glass for Romina

RAY
On the red carpet can you walk in
front of me so I can stare at your
arse while you upstage the
celebrities

Romina downs half a glass of bubbly hurls the rest at Ray

ROMINA
Why go to all this effort if all
you planned to do was ruin this
night anyway

RAY
I need to kill as many birds as
possible with one stone Just in
case I don’t get a second chance

ROMINA
What

Ray pulls Romina’s perfect 10 list from a pocket

ROMINA (CONTD)
Where’d you get that

RAY
The identity of my informants is
sacrosanct

That means nothing to Romina
Cherry Oct17 2011 52

RAY (CONT’D)
I paid Janice your morally
unscrupulous work colleague a
couple of dollars for a copy

Ray holds up the list and points at number five

RAY (CONTD)
Number five a good listener
Number seven thoughtful Numero
oche ‘someone who can cool my
fiery Latino temper’

Romina snatches the list off Ray

ROMINA
You don’t know me at all

RAY
I watch and listen to everything
you say and do

ROMINA
Obviously not well enough or you’d
know I hate roses champagne and
tacky stretch limos

Romina whacks Ray around the face with the roses Ray leans
forward and raps on a window

RAY
Angus

Angus the driver pulls over and lowers a black partition

RAY (CONTD)
Good call on the clean-up waiver
insurance

ANGUS
All part of the service

Angus smiling hands Ray two bottles of Brazilian beer and a
bunch of lilies Ray offers Romina a Brazilian beer

RAY
Do you have any idea how difficult
it is to get Brazilian beer in
Glasgow

Romina accepts a beer shocked softening Ray offers lilies
RAY (CONTD)
The flowers on the other hand were

a piece of piss

Romina accepts the flowers a hint of a smile in her eyes
Romina curious puts him to the test
Cherry Oct17 2011 53

ROMINA
What was the first thing I said to
you tonight

RAY
You said “I changed seven times
because I didn’t want to embarrass
you” You meant “thanks a lot for
making fuck-all effort”

ROMINA
(the killer question)
Why us
RAY

Because I’m jealous of every person
who has made you want to kiss them
Because I’m jealous of every person
who makes you smile Because you
think I fucking swear too much and
I think youve slept with too many
fucking people But most of all
because I want to be number ten -

Ray holds the list up to her face points at number 10

RAY (CONTD)
- your best friend - so badly that
I’m willing to risk destroying
everything we have so that after
tonight I never again have to prove
my prowess at number three part
two -

Ray indicates number 3 part 2

RAY (CONT’D)
- great at make-up sex - because
well never argue fuss or fight
and I’1l be too busy trying to make
the rest of your life perfect

Romina looks at Ray for a long time studies him then slaps
him hard in the face Twice harder the second time

ANGUS
We’re here Mann’s Chinese Theatre

ROMINA
I don’t want to see this film with
you tonight In fact I don’t even
want to put one foot on that red
carpet with you

Angus winds up the partition window avoiding the shrapnel
Cherry Oct17 2011 54

ROMINA (CONTD)
I want you to walk behind me and
check out my ass while I figure out
a place we can have make-up sex
while the upstaged celebrities are
watching the movie

Romina smiles genuinely impressed and deeply moved
ROMINA (CONTD)
The argue fuss and fight line was

Simply Red I love that song

RAY
I take back everything I said

Romina raises a hand Ray catches it They kiss passionately

EXT MANN’S THEATRE LATER

Bulbs flash and high-energy rock music bombards Ray as he
follows Romina up a red carpet eyes locked on her ass
INT ARCADE PIER

Matt scouts a video game arcade for a specific machine He
gets anxious unable to find it and grabs an attendant

MATT
Where’s Missile Command

ATTENDANT
How should I know Try the museum

Matt continues his search and finds Charlie at SPACE ACE a
laserdisc machine Drunk the game captivates her

MATT
Room for another player Ace

Charlie shuffles over Later engrossed in SPACE ACE neither
has kept track of time Matt glances at his watch

MATT (CONTD)
I’m beginning to sober up
EXT HUNTINGTON BEACH SUNSET

Matt and Charlie drink beer dodging crashing waves reliving
the game Booze has drowned guilt and clouded judgement

CHARLIE
I think I make a very good ACE
Cherry Oct17 2011 55

Charlie zaps imaginary foes with an imaginary laser gun then
sprints after Matt attempting a dramatic mock-rescue but
all she manages to do is trip over her feet and collapse in
the surf

A cold-water shock jolts her out of the surf She struggles
to her feet but heavy waterlogged boots make standing
difficult and she stumbles against Matt

He pulls her up and wraps his arms around her giving her
warmth For a moment neither breaks the embrace happy where
they are Charlie gives into her emotions and kisses Matt

A sloppy romantic embrace as shivering bodies send lips off
target until Matt pushes her away body language unreadable

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Something wrong

MATT
The opposite
(beat)
Youre shivering

Matt takes Charlie’s hand and drags her up the beach

EXT FIRE PITS BEACH LATER
Fighting emotions Matt puts a shirt around Charlie and
busies himself lighting a fire He sits opposite her Sensing
sudden distance Charlie leans into the flames for warmth
They sit together staring at the flames mesmerized
CHARLIE
I find flames mesmerizing Always

have done

Matt hardly hears her He starts hallucinating making angry
dancing flames morph into Emma’s face

EMMA
Eat Drink Hunt Fuck

Charlie teases the fire with a stick like a little kid
CHARLIE
In your flat the girl in the
photos was she your wife

Matt looks at Emma in the flames he can barely speak

MATT
Her name is Emma

CHARLIE
She was beautiful
Cherry Oct17 2011 56

MATT
She IS beautiful

CHARLIE
When

MATT

Four years ago Meningitis
That kills the conversation for a long while Finally

CHARLIE
When I was a little girl my young
nephew and I used to get shipped
off to my Grandmother’s for
Christmas so my sister could have
a break and our parents could
destroy each other in festive
peace She was a real character
Old frail but bursting with life
She had a huge fire just like this
one We’d sit in front of it for
days listening to her stories She
used to describe love feeling like
eating butterflies on toast Shed
talk and we’d tease the flames
Bending them to our will

Charlie teases the fire some more mesmerized by the beauty

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
She’d constantly warn us ‘don’t
sit too close you’ll get taught a
painful lesson’

Matt can’t take his eyes off Emma as flames engulf her Hands
blacken Skin spits Flames chase hair up her blistered face

EMMA
Traitor tell the whore her sob
story won’t work

Charlie looks at Matt as she speaks but he’s miles away

CHARLIE
Then one day we proved her right

EMMA
Boo hoo fucking ooo

MATT
Shut up Emma

Charlie can’t believe after that revelation he called her
Emma She gets up walks off doesn’t look back
Cherry Oct17 2011 57

EXT LIZARD LOUNGE NIGHT

Matt walks into the Lizard Lounge alone to a high-energy
music blast which seems alien and downbeat

Later Matt drifts through the club surrounded by ecstatic
BEASTIE BOYS fans He couldn’t be more isolated
EXT CHARLIE’S FLAT NIGHT

Matt leans a BEASTIE BOYS white label against her door

EXT CHARLIE’S FLAT NIGHT

Todd knocks (unannounced) Charlie answers in her pyjamas
She looks at Todd his body language begging for sex then
notices a WHITE LABEL leaning against milk bottles

TODD
Can I come in

Charlie picks up the vinyl record She turns and walks back
inside her flat Todd follows her
INT CHARLIE’S FLAT LATER

Charlie studies the record Todd studies Charlie looking at
her longingly his mind fixated on sex very little else

TODD
I need a drink

Charlie pours him a glass of wine barely puts a drop in her
own glass It takes a moment for Todd to pick up on her body
language

TODD (CONTD)
Bad day

CHARLIE
I’m tired that’s all
INT FLAT NIGHT
Matt walks in avoids the bathroom He slumps on a bed
EMMA (0S)
(nervously jealous)

How did the hunt go

MATT
I don’t want to talk about it
Cherry Oct17 2011 58
EMMA (0S)
I do Matt Talk to me Matt

Matt puts his head under a pillow trying to drown her voice

INT URINAL VINYL DAY

The next day and Charlie hasn’t shown up for work a fact
given life by Matt’s hang-dog down-trodden demeanor

Which is in complete contrast to Ray who looks absurdly
happy and Goth who stands flirtatiously close to Matt
actually smiling

Bunker is a little put off by the weird scene as he enters
and grabs Ray pulling him out of earshot of Goth

BUNKER
I want to make her a mixtape

RAY
(smiling)
I think she’d like that

Bunker shoots Ray a concerned look

BUNKER
What’s the matter with you

RAY
Love

BUNKER
Fuck

RAY

(imitating Donna Summer)
“TI feel loveeeeee”

Bunker kicks Ray in the shins surprisingly hard

BUNKER
I need you to cut that shit out for
a start This is my virginity we’re
talking about here

Ray looks at Bunker in a new light

RAY
Won’t happen again Sorry

Ray for Bunker’s sake regains his old misanthropic values

RAY (CONT’D)
Unlike sexual partners you never

forget your first mixtape
(MORE)
Cherry Oct17 2011 59

RAY (CONTD)
You sure she’s the one you want to
lose it to

BUNKER
Two words Lennon and Yoko

Ray has major concerns but can’t deny the conviction in
Bunker’s eyes

RAY
It’s gonna cost you

BUNKER
My world is black without her
colour Name your price

Ray pulls Romina’s champagne-stained list from a pocket and
points to number 9 -- a good dancer That’s all that remains
un-ticked
RAY
Tell anyone and I’11 kill you
INT STOCK ROOM LATER

Matt finds Ray in the stockroom searching through a pile of
records Grim-faced Matt hands Ray some letters

MATT
The banks all politely told me to
piss off

RAY

So that’s why you’re moping round
like a grown up version of Goth I
thought it was because Charlie
hasn’t come within a mile of this
place ever since you took her
hunting

MATT
I’m being serious

RAY
So am I Matt At the eighteenth
time of trying I finally get a
woman in here who makes you forget
just for a second that Emma died
four years ago And who also made
you remember you got a dick in your
pants Somewhere And what do you
do You cock up so badly she can’t
face the prospect of stepping foot
in this mausoleum ever again
Cherry Oct17 2011 60

MATT
We have three weeks to find 30000
or the rental agreement gets
terminated

RAY
You just renewed the rental
agreement

MATT
I’ve been late on the odd payment
Apparently that triggered a clause
in the contract which allows the
freeholder to financially protect
himself We don’t find the money I
lose this place Flat and all

RAY
Maybe that would be a good thing

MATT
Don’t expect a glowing reference
And for your information she
didn’t make me forget Emma she
made me remember

Ray feels the pain in the words and smiles at his friend

RAY

I was right about your dick

though wasn’t I
MATT

(lying)

You don’t know me as well as you

think I screwed Maddie In the

plural As in repeat offender

Matt relishes Ray’s jaw dropping then leaves the storeroom

TODD
Ah Charlie This is Darren Osman
chief executive and founding member
of CD Emporium

DARREN OSMAN a smarmy 35 year old public school type smiles
at Charlie as he looks her up and down like a piece of meat

OSMAN
I understand you’re personally
responsible for catering to my
deepest darkest desires

Charlie is deadpan Todd smiles with servitude towards Osman

TODD
The flagship Argyll Street I was
telling Darren you’re really
fighting in the trenches on this

one
CHARLIE
Why do you want Argyll Street so
badly
OSMAN

Stupid really I used to sell
records to kids at boarding school
The record store on Argyll was my
easy pick-up Sent younger kids
there for months They’d carry in a
few rubbish albums and the idiots
in the store would give them the
latest cool ones for free Some
kind of daft musical baptism
ritual Anyway one day they
realized my scam banned me from
the store Never forgot that
moment Seriously dented my bottom
line that summer

The fiscal situation at your
current bastion of employment -
(to Bunker)
- and your public school satellite
annex is precarious

GOTH
Speak fucking English idiot

RAY

The store closes down in three
weeks unless we find 30 thousand
so you

(to Goth)
better start scouting local morgues
for receptionist work

(to Bunker)
and you find a way to come to terms
with private school kids taking the
piss out of your ironic nickname

BUNKER
I can’t go to school I have
unfinished business here

RAY
Then we need to come up with a get
rich quick plan

INT BATHROOM NIGHT
No lights just flickering shadows from hundreds of candles
Matt enters the room naked and gets in a bath behind Emma

She leans back He strokes her wet hair and kisses her neck

EMMA
You like her don’t you

Matt remains silent stroking Emma’s hair
EMMA (CONTD)
You don’t have to tell I can read

Matt’s emotions surge and plunge he grabs hold of Emma’s
body tightly desperate to be close to her

struggle

Emma stands Her form solidifies almost solid She puts her
hands on a wall and offers herself to Matt doggy-style

MATT
I love you

EMMA

Matt grabs Emma but from a new angle we see Matt back to
us alone masturbating It’s a gut-wrenching pathetic
sight interrupted - by Ray

Ray shielding his eyes grabs a toilet roll and leaves

INT FLAT LOUNGE SECTION LATER

Ray joins Matt on a sofa and hands him a bottle of tequila

It’s OK That initial shock
reaction thing Over Forgotten We

dignified and non-childlike manner

MATT
Can we

RAY
Fuck no Are you shitting me That
was like watching 3-D soft porn

Ray takes a slug of tequila from his bottle

RAY (CONTD)
You didn’t with Maddie did you

Matt shakes his head Ray takes another gulp of tequila

RAY (CONTD)

Get power drinking We need to
consume enough tequila to
obliterate every image of that
candle-wank-fest from my memory
And yours

MATT
Shit I need help
Cherry Oct17 2011 64

Ray thumps Matt hard in the leg twice

RAY
One for the image Second because
you don’t need help You need sex
With a living female I would offer
Romina but I don’t think our
relationship has matured enough
yet

Ray guzzles tequila like water Matt smiles but it’s just a
crease on his lips Ray pushes Matt’s bottle into his mouth

RAY (CONTD)
This is your final warning Close
the deal with a living person or
I’1l tell everyone you wank with
candles

Hannah scrutinizes Charlie A wickedly uncomfortable moment
Then unexpectedly Hannah undoes a button on Charlie’s blouse

HANNAH (CONTD)
He was right You have nice tits

Charlie swipes her hand away forcing a self-deprecating
laugh from Hannah She offers a hand sadly weak and human

HANNAH (CONTD)
It hurts more when the ones he
sleeps with are prettier than I am
Hannah

Charlie reluctantly takes her hand and shakes it

CHARLIE
Charlie

HANNAH
I take it he didn’t mention the
pregnancy

CHARLIE
He didn’t mention the sex before
the pregnancy

Hannah rubs her belly protective instincts empowering her

unsettling for you

I intend to hurt him financially I
was hoping you’d take care of the
physical pain

vessels and a bruised ego he’1l be
fine Unfortunately we couldn’t
save his wedding ring

CHARLIE

Revenge for a non-immaculate
conception

PHIL
I don’t know you so I’1l make this
simple Hurt whoever you want

He turns back and hands Charlie a two-piece wedding ring

INT CHARLIE’S APARTMENT DAY

Alone at last Charlie shuts a door on the world and loses
it She screams and argues with herself like a mad woman

CHARLIE
How could you be so bloody stupid
(beat)
Don’t answer that You always give
yourself shitty advice

Charlie pours a big glass of wine drinks some and calms
down slightly She tries to take her mind off things by
tidying up then she checks her answer-phone for messages

BRITTANY
(shouting over speaker)
What part of Thursday didn’t you
remember Selfish bitch How the
hell could you forget after what
you did to him

CHARLIE
SHITINIrh)rdirdir FUCK FUCK

Charlie hurls a wine glass it smashes against a wall

BRITTANY
(quieter through speaker)
Not that you give a toss but
Tommy’s fine
(beat)
The only person you give a crap
about is yourself

Charlie stops the message she’s heard enough She deletes
the message then sits in silence After a moment she allows
herself a self-indulgent cry which just makes things worse
Cherry Oct17 2011 73

CHARLIE
I’m sorry I’m so sorry

INT URINAL VINYL STORE DAY

Ray and Bunker are at the sales counter dissecting the
mixtape playlist Matt is beside them but light years away

RAY
Mixtapes unlike sex require
delicate foreplay You gotta start
with something that gets the girl
in the right mood Right Matt

MATT
Yeah

RAY
Final warning - candles

MATT
She didn’t call

RAY
She didn’t call She didn’t come
in She didn’t do anything Matt
Don’t wait to fuck another ghost

Matt picks up the phone He dials slyly keeping a finger on
the CALL QUIT button Ray is too preoccupied to notice

RAY (CONTD)
With sex it’s easy A scenic
drive Romantic lighting Alcohol
It all works Even rabbits fucking
on a hard shoulder

Bunker’s blank stare registers too much information

RAY (CONTD)
Melanie Thomas Save that one until
youre a little older
(beat)
Mixtapes are different It’s all
about the sequence Fuck up the
foreplay sex is off the menu

BUNKER
I just want her to like the music
and hopefully me Ray

Ray pats Bunker hard on the back and picks up a pen
RAY

Spoken like a true virgin Show me

Bunker hands Ray a list of titles with just a hint of pride

RAY (CONTD)

Tuesday’s gone Lynyrd Skynryd
Maybe I’m amazed Wings The

Stones I melt with you Modern
English And finishing off with

Ray smiles impressed

RAY (CONTD)
If those ageless classics don’t
soften Goth’s black heart she’s
either deaf or emotionally barren

Bunker beams with pride Matt puts his hand over a receiver

MATT
You have a title

BUNKER
As Roger Daltry said “Love is
vengeance”

Matt smiles seriously proud then returns to his call

MATT
Saturday is no good we got a fund-
raiser for the store How about

Ray ruffles Bunker’s hair and writes LOVE IS VENGEANCE on a
tape card Matt kills a nonexistent call turns to Bunker

The store is empty Bunker and Matt watch Ray slink off down
an aisle and try out some dance moves unnoticed He’s awful

BUNKER
Deaf people have more rhythm than

MATT
Dead people have more rhythm than

BUNKER
Anyone who dances that badly
doesn’t deserve to blackmail you
Especially when you like Charlie

MATT
The problem is that Charlie doesn’t
like me Maddie does
Cherry Oct17 2011 76

BUNKER
How do you figure that

MATT
I called round her place a few days
ago to apologize I haven’t heard a
thing from her since

BUNKER
Would you make a mixtape for
Maddie
Matt’s expression says it all NO
BUNKER (CONTD)
Then apologize again And again and
again if you have to
(beat)

CHARLIE
I was at the hospital Todd’s
wife’s pregnant I nearly severed

Cherry Oct17 2011 81

Charlie’s self-pitying manner tips Brittany over the edge
Years of pent-up aggression manifest in words

BRITTANY
You say it like I’m supposed to
feel sorry for you Like everything

perfect life has nothing remotely
to do with you Don’t you get it
Don’t you see You create this

EXT URINAL VINYL STORE NIGHT

A heaving crowd gathers around a makeshift stage erected
outside the URINAL VINYL store Energy and volume build

Behind the crowd outside the shop front window Matt sells
Rock n Roll memorabilia to eager fans Littering a line of
tables are posters artwork signed and framed 12 inch discs
life-size cutouts of lead singers

Matt takes in the crowd He spots couples laughing and
dancing which makes him sad He seriously thinks about
walking off when Ray arrives clutching a wad of money
Cherry Oct17 2011 82

RAY
Shit I hope that kid can string a
note

Ray notices Matt’s sour demeanor

himself he needs -

BACKSTAGE
A very young EDDIE VEDDER and his band-mates tune guitars
ON STAGE

Bunker walks on stage and grabs a mic He nervously coughs
taps a mic and gazes out over the crowd spotting Matt Ray
Romina and Goth among a sea of unfamiliar faces

BUNKER

My name is Michael I’m 15 My
friends who all work here call me
Bunker because for the last year
I’ve ditched school and come here
to get an education

(beat)
In that time I’ve learnt more
about music love and most
importantly life at Urinal Vinyl
than I have done during my entire
time at school

(beat)
But unless we find 30000 dollars
within three weeks and save this
place from becoming a soulless CD
Emporium my education here will
cease

(looks straight at Goth)
If that happens I will go back to
learning nothing of consequence and
the woman I love will disappear
from my young life forever

(MORE)
Cherry Oct17 2011 83

BUNKER (CONTD)
(beat)
So dig deep donate some note and
help me save the only place I call
home And in doing so know that
you are also helping me lose my
virginity in a dignified manner

The mostly young crowd holler clap and shout approval
especially a pretty girl standing next to Goth Bunker
thrusts a mixtape aloft like He-Man shoving a sword skyward

BUNKER (CONTD)
This tape contains everything I
know about music I intend to give
it along with my heart to my
future wife in exchange for
everlasting love

The crowd go wild But to Bunker it could be the vacuum of
space as he locks eyes with Goth - and she turns away

BUNKER (CONTD)

(devastated but

heroically trying to

cover it)
And now

(beat composes himself)
Two wise men well one is wise the
other is a dickhead once told me
that when the Rock Gods you know
DID IT they created Led Zeppelin

More applause and screams Bunker points backstage

BUNKER (CONTD)
I don’t know if that is true but I
like to hope it is Anyway if Led
Zep and Janis Joplin had a child
it would probably sound like the
next person to walk on this
stage

(beat)

People of Huntington and
surrounding suburbs I give you the
future of Rock music Eddie
Vedder and his band BAD RADIO

Eddie Vedder leads his band on stage Even at this age he
has star quality That gravelly voice

EDDIE VEDDER
A little whiles back the people at
UV taught me a valuable lesson and
introduced me to one of my heroes

Eddie starts singing THE WAITING by TOM PETTY perfectly
Cherry Oct17 2011 84

EDDIE VEDDER
“Oh baby don’t it feel like heaven
right now”

HALFWAY THROUGH THE SONG

EDDIE VEDDER (CONT’D)

THROUGHOUT THE NEXT SEQUENCE WE CUT BETWEEN THE STAGE AND THE
MEMORABILIA STAND OUTSIDE URINAL VINYL

ONSTAGE WE HEAR LOCAL BANDS PLAYING SOME GOOD SOME NOT

MANNER NONE OF THE BIG NAMES ON THE LIST HAVE SHOWED UP

AT THE MEMORABILIA STAND WE SEE GOTH AVOID BUNKER GOTH STARE
LONGINGLY AT MATT MATT LOOKING LOST RAY AND ROMINA FLIRTING
LIKE TEENAGERS

INT URINAL VINYL LATER

In the background we hear an awful band doing their best to
kill the gig so much so that customers have spilled inside
the shop shopping rather than listening the terrible din

Ray exits the storeroom dressed like a skier He walks behind
the counter then serves a customer as if nothing is amiss

Goth watches Matt serve a customer then disappear into the
storeroom She makes sure the others are busy then follows
him Bunker waits a moment then follows her

INT STOREROOM SAME

Goth walks in and quietly locks the door from the inside
Matt has his back to her hunting for a particular record so
he pays no attention as she strips

When he does turns around Goth stands before him in
provocative underwear nervous yet resolute She fidgets with
a blond wig cut to the shape of Charlie’s hairstyle

GOTH
It’s for you It all works just
never been used

Matt looks Goth squarely in the eyes as he walks up to her
pulls off her wig and puts his arms around her
Cherry Oct17 2011 85

MATT
This was never going to happen

Anger acute embarrassment heart-piercing loss and every
other emotion a teenage virgin experiences after rejection
can only have one outcome Goth violently pushes Matt away

GOTH
That conniving bitch has ruined
everything I warned her

MATT
This has nothing to do with
Charlie

GOTH

This has everything to do with her

Goth gathers her clothes She spits venomous looks at Matt as
she dresses quickly Matt looks at her with genuine pity

MATT
I know what it’s like to want
someone you can’t have

GOTH
(trying to save face)
I lied about the virginity thing I
thought it might turn an older guy
like you on

Goth continues dressing getting angrier more spiteful

GOTH (CONTD)

This whole stupid charade is a
waste of time CD Emporium have got
some insolvency court ruling which
allows them to buy the freehold for
this place whether you raise
30000 or not

MATT
How do you know that

GOTH
Because the bitch youre stupidly
infatuated with is shagging my
father as well as working for him
And he works for Allet Property who
work for CD Emporium You’re so
stupid you never even saw it
coming

Goth relishes the effect the words have on Matt before
storming out -
Cherry Oct17 2011 86

EXT STOREROOM SAME
- and walks into Bunker who holds a mixtape in his hand

BUNKER
I love you

Numbly Goth takes the tape and reads the inscription which
angers her even more She shoves it back into Bunker’s hand

GOTH
I’m wearing lose-my-virginity
underwear for someone other than
you The person who has just seen
said lose-my-virginity underwear
has this minute rejected me I’m so
horny and emotional right now if
you had zero dignity and still
wanted to give me that mixtape I
would probably shag your dumb
brains out So you better get out
of my way

Bunker processes the info With zero dignity he hands Goth
the mixtape

BUNKER
My love is stronger than my
dignity

That shocks Goth Her anger dies She lustily kisses him
then whispers in his ear as she puts the tape in his pocket

GOTH
Nothing you ever do will make me
remember you I don’t feel like
that Give it to someone who will

EXT STREET LATER

Bunker hunches down on pavement numb He turns the mixtape
over in his hands He doesn’t notice a pretty girl watching
him curiously He sits there with his lost innocence and a
broken heart

EXT STREET SAME

A group of breakdancers up on stage entertain the crowd
Ray appears from behind a curtain dressed like ICE-T ski
goggles puffa jacket LOOKING RIDICULOUS is understating it

He shakes with bone-chilling nerves but somehow holds it
together The breakdancers move aside as Ray

» moonwalks on stage locking and popping out of synch

Think LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE or NAPOLEON DYNAMITE the
difference being that RAY CANNOT DANCE

Romina mortified yet absurdly impressed jumps up on stage
and drags him to safety away from the heckling crowd

ROMINA
Is this about the list

Ray nods Romina pulls a copy of the list from a pocket and
rips it up in front of Ray’s eyes

ROMINA (CONTD)
Never ever dance in public again
unless it’s at our wedding
Ray removes his ski goggles grabs Romina by the waist He
twists her around in an exultant twirl like a ballerina

He’s expecting you

Goth watches Charlie disappear in the crowd with the tiniest
hint of a revengeful smile on her mascara-streaked face

EXT STREET LATER

The PRETTY GIRL approaches Bunker and smiles sweetly at him
Her eyes light up when she sees he still holds the mixtape
but his remain fixed on the cassette rotating in his hands

Christy jumps on Bunker and starts making out (Years later
they get married and Christy plays the tape on their wedding
night) After a raunchy snog Christy jumps off Bunker

It’s slow sensual almost achingly passionate We see how
much love they shared and lost in that moment As the kiss
finishes and they pull away both their chests are heaving
both are breathless like they just ran a marathon
