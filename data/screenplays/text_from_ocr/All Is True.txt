ALL IS TRUE

Screenplay by

Ben Elton
Black As the following lines appear on screen the familiar
Droeshout portrait of William Shakespeare fades very slowly
into view

William Shakespeare was born on April 23rd 1564 in the
English market town of Stratford Upon Avon He was the son of
a glove maker

On November 27th 1582 he married Anne Hathaway Will was 18
Anne was 26 and already pregnant They had three children

In the early 1590’s Will moved to London where he was to
become the most successful and famous writer of his age

His family remained in Stratford
Will’s only son Hamnet died in 1596 aged eleven

The portrait slowly dissolves from the canvas image into a
living breathing version of the man himself gazing the same
enigmatic gaze at the viewer

CUT TO BLACK

As the following lines appear we scan across a period map of
the densely crowded buildings of Elizabethan London As we
find Southwark and its crammed streets we close in on the
roof of a round topped building

On June 29th 1613 a performance of Shakespeare’s Life of
Henry VIII was given at The Globe Theatre It was advertised
under it’s alternative title

ALL IS TRUE

INT DARKENED GLOBE STAGE 1

One actor (The Chorus) is performing the opening Prologue
of ALL IS TRUE

CHORUS
Be sad as we would make ye think
ye see
The very persons of our noble story
As they were living think you see
them great
Then in a moment see
How soon this mightiness meets

misery

And if you can be merry then Ill
Say

A man may weep upon his wedding-
day

Card During Act 1 Scene 4 a misjudged stage effect began a
fire

against the frame-filling flames Shouts and screams and
panic off screen

EXT THE GLOBE - DAWN 3

Low wide shot of a grey smoking empty wasteland A figure
stands in the smoldering aftermath of the fire

Close on the figure who slowly turns to face us Not the

haunted man

with good reason Will’s attention is far away

LANDLADY
Don’t see a lot of strangers
(beat)
Name’s Dotia It’s my pub
Will ignores her The Landlady becomes wary

LANDLADY (CONTD)
And who might you be

WILL
(startled)
Who am I

He looks away again Almost to himself

WILL (CONTD)

Who am I
(far away)
I I have worked in the theatre

This exchange has confirmed her suspicions

LANDLADY
Right then I’1l1 have the reckoning
before you eat if it’s all the same
to you

A look from Will

LANDLADY (CONTD)
I seen you strolling player types
before

WILL
And

LANDLADY
An’ you ain’t exactly gen’lemen

WILL
I am exactly a gentleman and Non
sanz droict
(the landlady doesn’t
understand)
“Not without right You might see

He reaches into his bag and pulls out a heavy bag of coins
He tosses a gold coin down The landlady’s eyes widen

Will preoccupied still About to leave The Boy is there
ignored by Will

BOY

BOY
I had a story But it was never
finished

Will is fastening his cloak against the chill Irritated by
this nonsense

BOY (CONTD)
Will you finish it for me Please

Will is becoming impatient for his horse Looks to the tavern
door

WILL
I’m done with stories lad And I
wouldn’t know how to finish yours

BOY (VO)
Yes you would Of course you would

Light thickens in the silent dusk Will ignores the child and
stares at the road ahead as he waits fearful wondering
After a moment he looks back around The boy has gone The
Landlady comes to the door

WILL
Where’s the Boy

LANDLADY
What Boy

WILL
The lad who took my horse

LANDLADY
No boy here We found your horse
untethered

Will shivers He looks out at the gloomy light

He looks back at the Landlady who clearly has seen and heard
nothing

JOHN HALL
God burned your theatre but spared
you Thus is he both wise and
merciful
Perhaps this is offered as comfort but it doesn’t give any
Will looks at John for a moment then stares once more into
the fire Remembering Thinking Anne breaks the silence

of a thief I thought my world had
ended

Will looks about him Remembering

WILL (CONTD)
I loved this place You children
loved it too

SUSANNA
Yes we came here every day
Although Hamnet never went in the
water He wasn’t bold like Judith
Or even me

WILL
But his mind was bold

what he’d written I told him then
that I was the proudest father in
the Kingdom I still am

this slight

the mob from our Lord

Will considers this for a moment A lark sings
WILL

Does the Lark song distract you
from your God John

JOHN HALL
Of course not It is evidence of
God

WILL
Well then Perhaps for some I was
a Lark

Will offers this with gentle twinkle John Hall is slightly
floored he is about to attempt an answer but realizes he
hasn’t really got one He gathers his dignity

JOHN HALL
I came to ask a favour Father in
Law But I am loath to distract a
man from his labours Will you call
when you are done with your garden

left with the girl The useless

Now an earnest young student appears at the gate Henry

HENRY
Mr Shakespeare I don’t want to
pester you

WILL
Good Excellent news Cheerio then

HENRY
It’s just that I wanted to ask

WILL
The best way to get started as a
writer is to start writing
Cheerio

HENRY
No really could I

All Is True - Shooting Script 23

WILL
I don’t have a favourite play I
admire all my fellow dramatists
equally And yes I do think women
should be allowed to perform the
female roles as is the practice on
the continent Now please If
youll excuse me

Will returns to his digging Defeated Henry almost leaves
but doesn’t

HENRY
I have come all the way from
Cambridge to see you I left my
college without leave

WILL
(wearily)
And that was your choice

Henry gets the message Starts to walk away Stops and turns
One last go

HENRY
I just want to ask - how you knew

WILL
Knew what

HENRY
Everything

WILL
My friend I don’t even know how to
keep the slugs out of the
Hollyhocks

HENRY
(impatient)
The world is full of gardeners I
mean everything that matters

Will raises an eyebrow at this

HENRY (CONTD)
There is no corner of this world
which you have not explored No
geography of the soul you can not
navigate How How do you know

Finally Will is forced to engage

WILL
What I know If I know it And I
don’t say that I do I have -
(a moment to consider)
Imagined
All Is True - Shooting Script

HENRY
But they say you left school at
fourteen You’ve never travelled
Imagined From what

WILL
From my self

HENRY
Your self

WILL
Yes Everything I’ve ever done
Everything I’ve ever seen every
book I’ve ever read and every
conversation I have ever had
including God help me this one
You will find the whole of me in
every word I ever wrote My
thoughts my feelings my dreams
If you would be a playwright and
speak for others then speak first
for yourself Search within
Consider the contents of your own
soul Your humanity For that is
the business of the theatre
Everything else is just stage
directions

Henry is trying to take it all in Will takes a little pity

and tries to sum it up in a more kindly tone

WILL (CONTD)
Write what you are what you know
what you feel and what you can
imagine my friend And if you are
honest then whatever you write all
is true

Henry wants to reply but can’t think what to say

WILL (CONTD)
Now please If you can’t save my
hollyhocks leave me to mourn the
dead

Will returns to his digging Henry is confused but also
strangely inspired He knows he should leave but can not
resist pushing his luck

HENRY
Then why

Will looks up Fierce now The boy’s being rude Henry
returns his stare

All Is True - Shooting Script 25

HENRY (CONTD)
Why did you stop Why do you write
no more

A beat Is Will considering an answer Another beat If he
was he doesn’t give it

arrive Will attempts to greet them as equals but again Sir
Thomas merely nods curtly at the Shakespeare’s Will pained
and embarrassed

Rafe Smith enters For a moment he catches Susanna’s eye Do
they share a secret

Will notices this and turns to look at Hall who is also
staring at Rafe Smith

The dissolute John Lane is at the back Tense Sweating
perhaps discreetly drinking He stares at Susanna and then at
Rafe Smith Building up to something

The Vicar Edward Woolmer begins the service

Quiney bustles in late with a pretty girl Margaret Wheeler
following Both a little disheveled

Now the service is almost over

EDWARD WOOLMER

Our reading today was from the
first chapter of Corinthians “I
beseech ye bretheren in the name
of Jesus that there be no
divisions among you”

(beat)
There is division in our town The
Puritans protest against the old
ways The feastings the merriment
and customs long practised Some of
you resent this I know but I charge
you remember Corinthians These
good Christians act from honest
faith They are upright citizens
decent and pious
All Is True - Shooting Script 27

Suddenly John Lane jumps up

JOHN LANE
Are they Mr Woolmer Are they Or
are they fornicators

General shock

JOHN LANE (CONTD)
There is wickedness in this church
Mr Woolmer Puritan wickedness

He points at Susanna

JOHN LANE (CONTD)
I have seen Susanna Hall creep from
her husband’s house to Rafe Smith’s
chamber in the night

Card In the summer of 1613 John Lane yeoman of Stratford
publicly accused Shakespeare’s elder daughter Susanna of
infidelity with Rafe Smith the Haberdasher

Susanna mortified Will stunned The congregation in uproar
etc John Hall leaps to his feet

JOHN HALL
This slander will be answered

JOHN LANE
This slander will be proved You’1l
no more tell us how best to save
our souls Doctor Hall Not while
your Puritan wives fornicate worse
than whores and then send to London
for Mercury to physic what they got
of it

Card John Lane compounded his charge by stating that Susanna
had contracted Gonorrhea

The tumult grows
EDWARD WOOLMER
Silence This is a house of God

And I am master here

Edward Woolmer the Vicar glares at John Hall Sensing a
dangerous rival

Will is red faced with anger and shame He catches the
patronizing look of Sir Thomas Lucy half censure half pity

As the congregation bustle out all talking of the scandal
Sir Thomas Lucy pauses over Will

All Is True - Shooting Script 28

SIR THOMAS
Well well Sir You Shakespeare’s
are never far from a scandal are
you

Will is mortified Sir Thomas glances at Susanna

SIR THOMAS (CONTD)
I suppose she gets it from her
Grandfather Fixed the price of
Wool didn’t he Bad business And
illegal money lending to boot
Goodness He was a busy fellow No
wonder they chucked him off the
council

Will who is pretty dumb struck Anne however hit’s back

ANNE
Every family has it’s dark Horse
Sir Thomas Even the Lucy’s Or
perhaps it is another Thomas Lucy
who’s niece ran off with a serving
man in 1600

Sir Thomas moves on in fury

INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 74
The family assemble All sit in shocked silence Will enters

WILL
I have instructed my lawyers We
shall sue him for slander

SUSANNA
A public trial

WILL
It is a public slander

JOHN HALL
John Lane is a dangerous man We
can be sure he did not stage his
attack without some idea of how to
prove it

Beat Will turns to Susanna

WILL
Prove it

SUSANNA
How can you ask

WILL
Because your husband fears he can

All Is True - Shooting Script 29

John Hall is thrown by this He had not expected Will to
place such an astute interpretation on his remark

JOHN HALL
I mean that I fear he has
constructed a convincing lie
Judith seems almost to revel in Susanna’s discomfort
JUDITH
Well now What a disaster And that
it should befall such a fine and
blameless family as ours
Will is determined
WILL

The Shakespeare’s will not be
ruined twice

EXT THE HIGH STREET - DAY 75
Susanna hurries along All eyes turn on her Very different
from the respect she’s used to The town seems to be turning
against her reveling in her shame

INT CONSISTORY COURT AT WORCESTER - DAY 76
A packed court full of gawping towns folk The Shakespeare
family enter Some snigger some snarl The Puritan element

are tight lipped between shame and righteous anger

CARD The trial of John Lane for the slander of Susanna

JUDGE

foully used
The crowd erupts
CARD John Lane failed to attend his trial The case being
uncontested he was convicted of slander and excommunicated

77 INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 77

Anne and Will sit

ANNE
Why Why did this man slander our
Sue

WILL

My guess is to damage her husband
John Hall is a Puritan and would
make Holy Trinity and all the town
likewise John Lane on the other
hand likes his cakes and ale

ANNE
Then why did he not attend the
court and press his case

Beat

WILL

I discussed the matter with him
ANNE

Discussed Discussed what
WILL

I asked him if he’d ever seen Titus

Andronicus

78 INT THE TAVERN STRATFORD - NIGHT 78

Flashback Will has met John Lane

JOHN LANE
What do I know of plays Get away
from me I shall see you and your
whore daughter in Court

WILL
It concerns a Moorish villain named
Aaron And the African who played
him was magnificent and terrifying
All Is True - Shooting Script 31

79 INT THE GLOBE STAGE - DAY 79
A performance of Titus Intimidating passion and violence

ACTOR PLAYING AARON
To kill a man or else devise his

death

Ravish a maid or plot the way to
do it

Accuse some innocent and forswear
myself

Set deadly enmity between two
friends

Make poor mens cattle break their
necks

Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in
the night

And bid the owners quench them with
their tears

oft have I diggd up dead men from
their graves

And set them upright at their dear
friends doors

Tut I have done a thousand
dreadful things

As willingly as one would kill a

fly
And nothing grieves me heartily
indeed
But that I cannot do ten thousand
more
80 INT THE TAVERN STRATFORD - NIGHT 80

Flashback Will still talks with John Lane who is pretty
scared

WILL
Mighty like a lion Strong as a
bear I saw this man tear the heart
from a fool who wronged him and eat
it raw

Lane is fearful

WILL (CONTD)
And yet - he could be tender too
And one day his wild heart was
tamed He loved my daughter

JOHN LANE
Susanna

WILL
Ay Susanna Their love could never
be of course

(MORE )

All Is True - Shooting Script 32

WILL (CONTD)
But he swore that if ever she had
need his sword his claws and his
teeth would either defend her or
kill for her Should I tell him of
Susanna’s current distress

John Lane is suitably nervous

INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 81
Will and Anne

ANNE
Will I saw Titus Aaron was played
by the sweetest chap you could hope
to meet I talked to him for an
hour afterwards at the George Inn

WILL
Yes He was a lovely fellow Wife
but John Lane doesn’t know that
and I’ve never let the truth get in
the way of a good story

A moment of levity Anne for the first time a little less
cold

WILL (CONTD)
All men fear what they do not know
Anne and I’1l wager John Lane has
never laid eyes on an African

Anne once more reflective

ANNE
Do you think there was any truth in
it In what Lane said About
Susanna

WILL
Well There is coldness between
them We’ve seen that

Something they both recognize in themselves

INT HALL’S CROFT - EVENING 82

Susanna and John Hall sit in grim silence She stitches he
reads the Bible Will’s voice-over comments on the scene

WILL (VO)
‘Tis five years since she and John
have had a child

John rises

All Is True - Shooting Script 33

JOHN HALL
I’m going to bed Good night

He leaves Susanna sad and alone
WILL (VO)

And Susanna certainly knows this
Rafe Smith

INT RAFE SMITH’S SHOP - MORNING 83
A past moment Susanna is buying material Rafe holds some
cloth against her body as if to say “look this would suit
you” It is physical fun she blushes coyly

EXT THE TAVERN — DAY 84

Another past moment Susanna is hurrying from the tavern with
the broken package of Mercury

WILL (VO)
She did send to London for Mercury
Mercury is a cure for Pox

A drop or two more falls to the street as she hurries along
Susanna is nervous and embarrassed

INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S KITCHEN - EVENING 85
Will and Anne together

ANNE
Sue is not poxed Will I’d know

WILL
He thena poxed man is ever
pissing
INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING 86

Flashback to the Sunday morning they went to church when Hall
said he must answer nature’s call Susanna has just made her
comment about nature liking Hall’s company

HALL
Have you some objection to my
visiting the privy
INT HALL’S CROFT - NIGHT 87

John Hall in his bed chamber sweating and in pain He takes
a little bottle and swigs at it
All Is True - Shooting Script

88 INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Back with Will and Anne’s conversation
WILL
Is that why she bares no more
children Did she seek comfort
elsewhere

89 INT THE HIGH STREET - NIGHT

Susanna stealing into Smith’s house

90 INT SMITH’S BED - NIGHT
Smith and Susanna are making passionate love
SUSANNA
The Devil will take both our souls
for this
RAFE SMITH
But we go there by way of Heaven
91 INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S KITCHEN - EVENING
Will and Anne still talking
ANNE

Susanna is a God fearing woman She
would not betray her husband

Judith appears at the door She’s been listening

JUDITH

Maybe it wasn’t a betrayal
WILL

Judith
JUDITH

Maybe he told her to do it

92 INT HALL’S CROFT - EVENING
Susanna and John Hall sit

JOHN HALL
It will be either your womb or your
sister’s which secures your
father’s fortune

John stares at her Then returns to reading his Bible

All Is True - Shooting Script 35

93 INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 93
Judith confronting a shocked Anne and Will

JUDITH
Well it’s a thought isn’t it And
frankly Father if you got a
grandson by it Would you care if
it were true

Will decides not to answer this

WILL
I care that Susanna is free from
slander That you may be sure is
true

JUDITH
Nothing is ever true

94 EXT THE GREEN WOOD - DAY 94
Once more Will walks with Susanna

SUSANNA
You think my husband is trying to
whore me to get a bigger house

Will a bit flummoxed Susanna is not usually so forthright

SUSANNA (CONTD)
We should not seek to lift the veil
on other peoples marriages Father
All are complex To understand one
you have to live it
(beat)
And you’re hardly an expert there

Susanna walks on Will can only follow chastened

95 EXT THE GARDEN - DAY 95
A change of season Time is passing

Will works in his garden Some progress has been made on his
design Some curves and turns in the rails of turf but it’s
hard He is hot He is very tired The heat of the sun
starts to play tricks with his eyes as he shades them from
the glare As he works a boy leans on the fence It is the
boy from the tavern he masks his eyes against the Sun his
face once more in shadow

BOY
Got any berries
All Is True - Shooting Script 36

WILL
Eventually I have planted a
mulberry tree

BOY
Well then you’ve got time to
finish my story while we wait

The boy has removed his hands For the first time his face
clear Will’s eyes focus through the haze Is it his son

WILL
Hamnet Is it you

The boy seems half lost in the haze

BOY
I wrote you another poem today
Would you like to hear it

WILL
I want nothing more in this world

The boys cheerfulness suddenly gives way to rising anger

BOY
Well you’ll have to wait won’t you
Like I waited I had a poem before
for you but you never came The
sickness came instead and still you
didn’t come though Mother promised
you would

is

Now the boy emerges from the haze but in a horrifying visual
transformation he becomes a plague victim Great sores on his

face Will recoils in horror as the boy confronts him
BOY (CONTD)
I had a poem for you You never
came

Will recoils in horror as the boy confronts him

WILL
Hamnet

Anne’s voice intrudes upon the vision

ANNE
Will

Will spins around to her

ANNE (CONTD)
You’re shouting

He turns back there is no boy There was no boy

All Is True - Shooting Script
WILL
He was here Anne

ANNE
Hell always be here Will

Now we see that from an upper window Judith has been watching

WILL
In London now the plays are just
finished

Will is doing his best

WILL (CONTD)
Taverns full

JUDITH
If you’re missing London Why don’t
you go back there

This is getting hard for Will He is prepared to eat humble

pie

but this is relentless

WILL
Do you wish I would Daughter

JUDITH
It doesn’t matter what I wish but
what you wish And it isn’t to be
with us

WILL
What do you mean

JUDITH
You’ve come back to mourn Hamnet
To mourn your blessed departed son
and dig a bloody garden for him

ANNE
That’s enough Judith

JUDITH
We mourned him Father We mourned
him when he died And we mourned
him thereafter

(MORE )

All Is True - Shooting Script 38

JUDITH (CONTD)
Now it seems we must begin again as
if his grave was freshly dug
because suddenly you’ve found time
to mourn him too

WILL
Hold your tongue Respect your
Father even if you can’t respect
yourself

That was a hard blow Judith is in many ways a sorry sight
Careless of her appearance Often with a glass in her hand

WILL (CONTD)
If you are done with mourning him
at least honour his memory

JUDITH
How can you say I don’t

WILL
Then start living up to it If you
can not match his talent try to
match his goodness and his
diligence You are wasting your
life

Judith stares at her father

JUDITH
I know what you think’s the purpose
of a woman’s life I know what you
want from me

EXT NEW PLACE GARDEN - DAY 98

Seasons change In the montage we see a quiet Will getting

on with building this garden as best he can Thoughtful as

if all that Judith has said sits with him Preoccupies him

Occasionally he looks about him For signs of the boy There
are none Buds blossom Leafs fall

Will is measuring parts of the garden using twine and wheel
He is assisted by a serving girl Maria Will counts off the
yards

WILL
23 24 25

Maria is inclined to chat
MARIA
Bit of a change from making plays

in London

Will leans on his stick happy for a break He likes her He
considers her point
All Is True - Shooting Script 38A

WILL
In some ways yes Maria In others
Rather similar

MARIA
Similar I don’t see how

A light of enthusiasm begins to shine

WILL
Well today we take the measure of
our stage

MARIA
A garden ain’t a play

Will enjoying himself A relief from the grim family mood

WILL
A play a garden a fresh baked
loaf like the ones you bake each
morning All begin with an idea A
compulsion to create a thing of
beauty or need

MARIA
Bread begins with yeast and flour

WILL
Exactly Now you’re getting it
Ingredients Brambles bushes
Yeast flour Verses players
They’re nothing without a dream
Which will not be denied and which
endures in spite of all adversity
The weather will turn the bugs
will infest The oven will cool and
the flour will mould Your fellow
worker - in my case a brilliant
lunatic actor called Dick Burbage -
will interfere and demand a bigger
show for a smaller budget and a
shorter play with a much longer
part for himself And all of these
trials must be countered and
overcome without ever loosing sight
of the dream itself

MARIA
And what does it feel like when all
of that works

WILL
How does fresh baked bread smell

MARIA
Wonderful
All Is True - Shooting Script 38B

He smiles at her as if to say ‘exactly’ That’s his point
Maria is smiling too at his half comical passion

I heard you And I recall the day I
first heard about your friend the
Earl of Southampton

WILL
Wife

ANNE
Same day I heard there’d been a
book of poems published Sonnets
they told me

ANNE (CONTD)
Perhaps you thought because I
couldn’t read them I wouldn’t mind
But plenty of people can read Even
in our little town Including one
of your own daughters

WILL
Anne - Those sonnets were published
illegally Without my knowledge or
consent

ANNE
But you wrote ‘em Will And people
read ‘em And after they’d read
them they started asking “Who are
they then” “Who’s this dark lady
he’s so in love with”

WILL
They were just poems

ANNE

Douglas smiles he likes the answer They return to work
Later Anne brings Will some water An arm round the shoulder
An attempt to restore normality They slowly walk back
towards the house
INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S KITCHEN - EVENING 113
The family sit
JUDITH

I notice that your friend the Earl

didn’t bring his wife with him on

his travels Perhaps he doesn’t

find female company to his taste

If this was a jibe Will ignores it
All Is True - Shooting Script 49

WILL
I’m sure that His Grace and the
Countess Elizabeth are most happy
in their marriage

Possible discreetly raised eye brows from Anne and Judith

WILL (CONTD)
As I would wish you to be Judith
Why are you still unwed You are
pretty enough I think

JUDITH
I don’t

WILL
Then look in your glass

JUDITH
I have no glass

JUDITH (CONTD)
I didn’t like the person I saw in
it

Will getting a little irritated at her endless negativity

WILL
Good God Daughter that’s a bleak
thought since the only company you
keep is your own

JUDITH
But there it is

WILL
But what of children All women
want children

JUDITH
Apparently

WILL
Don’t you want a child

JUDITH
Do you want me to replace Hamnet
for you Father

This is brutal Will absorbs the blow Tries to be
reasonable

WILL
I meant for your own sake A
husband children For comfort
companionship
All Is True - Shooting Script 50

ANNE
She’s seen that marriage may not
bring you either

Will’s anger begins slowly to boil

WILL
Is that it Judith Have you seen
your mother’s misery and thought
better to be a spinster than
shackled to a man who neglects you

ANNE
I did not say I was miserable

WILL
No wife you didn’t but though I
put words into other people’s
mouths I too can occasionally see
beyond what is merely said

Anne shrugs Quite suddenly Will explodes Fist on table

WILL (CONTD)
And I will take no more of this I
have worked ceaselessly on behalf
of this family

ANNE
On your own behalf-

WILL
And I am head of this family I
have given you a fine house and
servants I have sent you money
all your life Is that not Comfort
You have two beautiful daughters a
brilliant son and a husband who
though absent kept you always in
his thoughts Is that not
companionship In abundance

Anne’s face suggests this is a stretch Will doubles down

WILL (CONTD)
I have raised this family up
Through my genius I have brought
fame and fortune to this house Yes
my genius Would you have had me
ignore that Ignore a gift from God
almighty so that I could be a
bloody glove maker and you might
feel a bit more appreciated

It’s a hard blow Will’s defense is to go deeper
All Is True - Shooting Script 51

WILL (CONTD)
Hamnet died and I wasn’t here I
know that The plague took him and
I wasn’t here But the plague has
taken millions and it would have
taken him whether I was in London
or in Stratford or on that
godforsaken highway We lost our
boy We lost our beautiful
brilliant brilliant boy and I
wasn’t there

Anne has merely bit her lip at all of this Now suddenly it
is Judith who answers Will Jumping up and shouting

JUDITH
Hamnet wasn’t brilliant

WILL
What

A beat Judith knows she has begun something which now can
not be stopped

JUDITH
He was beautiful but he wasn’t
brilliant

ANNE
Judith Don’t

WILL
What do you mean

JUDITH
I wrote them

WILL
Wrote what

ANNE
Judith I said don’t

JUDITH
The poems

There’s no turning back Judith grabs at Will’s satchel and
takes out the precious sheaf of papers

JUDITH (CONTD)
The verses you hold so dear With
wit and mischief in every line I
made them up Hamnet only wrote
them down

ANNE
She helped him a little that’s all
All Is True - Shooting Script

JUDITH
I made them up All of them Hamnet
was sweet and kind but he was no

poet

WILL
No He was

JUDITH
He wasn’t

WILL

Brilliant
Anne realizes the game is up

ANNE
No Will He was just an ordinary
little boy You would have seen it
in a moment had you ever looked

WILL
I looked

JUDITH
And you saw what you wanted to see
You saw yourself

ANNE
Judith Enough

WILL
Myself

JUDITH
A boy with a mind as big and bold
as yours But happy with a father
who appreciated his genius Well
Hamnet might not have been a genius
but he was clever enough to know
that he could never live up to what
you wanted him to be He dreaded
your visits

Will is devastated Anne tries to explain

ANNE
We didn’t plan it Not when it
began It was only that Jude was
always making up stories conjuring
rhymes One day Hamnet wrote one
of hers down for practise with his
pen You found it and thought it
was his and praised him so

Will tries to come to terms with all this

Judith has been holding the sheaf of papers
All Is True - Shooting Script 53

JUDITH
So are they worthless now

WILL
They aren’t his

JUDITH
Will you read them no more Sit in
the Sun and chuckle at their wit

WILL
They are not his

JUDITH
No They’re mine and so I will do
what I please with them

She throws them on the fire For a moment it seems as if Will
will jump up and pull them out But he doesn’t He watches
them burn

INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 114

It is very late Will now sits alone The empty satchel in
his lap Anne appears

ANNE
Judith tried to teach herself to
write you know After Hamnet died
But she never had the patience Not
like Sue

A moment of silence

ANNE (CONTD)
I should have liked to have been
able to write a few letters
Particularly married to you
Remember our wedding day Me older
and pregnant you this strange
clever lad of 18 I knew what
people thought I couldn’t even
sign the register had to make a
stupid mark I felt so foolish

Will looks at her he hadn’t known that

ANNE (CONTD)
Then you went off and become the
greatest writer in England With a
wife at home who couldn’t read a
single word I sometimes wondered
wether that bothered you at all
(beat)

But why would it You were hardly
here
All Is True - Shooting Script 54

They both sit in the firelight with their thoughts

115 EXT THE GREEN WOOD - DAY 115
Will walks with Susanna

SUSANNA
I didn’t know it was she who wrote
the verse But then Judith and
Hamnet were inseparable I wasn’t
allowed into their world

WILL
Why did she never tell me

SUSANNA
Out of loyalty to Hamnet I suppose
He wanted you to believe him
brilliant in life Why would he
wish it any less in death

WILL
It was cruel

SUSANNA
Cruel for her I think

WILL
For Judith

SUSANNA
Would you want to be denied credit
for your verse Have people think
someone else writ them Someone
better educated

WILL
No No I shouldn’t like it at all

SUSANNA
Well look at them afresh Celebrate
your living daughter rather than
your dead son Perhaps Judith will
finally smile again

Will is beginning to have some understanding of his
insensitivity

WILL
She burned them

SUSANNA
Burned them Why

WILL
Because I ama fool
All Is True - Shooting Script 55

Will walks on Susanna follows

SUSANNA
Father Why do you write no more

Will still does not wish to answer this But slowly he
tries

WILL
On the morning after the theatre
burnt I stood there among the
ruins determined to begin again
To write another play My greatest
yet To open another theatre Even
greater

He pauses Collecting his thoughts Susanna listens

WILL (CONTD)
And so I looked inside my self
Into my soul I looked as so often
I had looked before And this
time I found - Nothing There
was nothing there I was as barren
as the smoking ruins on which I
stood I was alone and frightened
and I realised this terrible thing
I realised that it just didn’t
matter to me anymore And there on
that sad morning I knew that I
would never write again My soul
was empty

SUSANNA
Your soul isn’t empty Father Your
soul has the whole world in it But
even if it was I’m glad For it’s
brought you home

Will is very moved

116 INT JUDITH’S BED CHAMBER - NIGHT 116
Judith in her room Will appears

WILL
I’m sorry

JUDITH
You lost your son Any man would
mourn A daughter is nothing
Destined only to become the
property of another man Or fade
away
All Is True - Shooting Script 56

WILL
You mustn’t fade Judith Why don’t
you write again

JUDITH
Father you know I can not write

WILL
I could teach you

For a moment Judith is taken aback This is such a potential
resetting of their relationship But it is too late

JUDITH

I have no verse in me any more
WILL

Why
JUDITH

Because the wrong twin died

WILL
No Plague took him Plague makes
no judgements It is just plague

JUDITH
I wish a plague had taken me

WILL
Judith Why do you hate yourself

JUDITH
I have stolen Hamnet from you
twice Once by surviving him and
now by taking your dream of him
away

WILL
You have given me a new dream My
beautiful daughter the Poet

JUDITH
A woman can not be a poet A woman
is put upon this Earth for but one
reason I know my duty now I will
make amends for stealing Hamnet
from you I promise I will make
amends

117 EXT THE GARDEN - DAY 117

not ambition that will blossom in
this garden

Anne looks at the garden It is still pretty grim She
smiles

ANNE
Well it had better because it
doesn’t seem like much else has
blossomed yet

WILL
I am a poor gardener It’s true I
found it much easier to create
things with words

ANNE
Life’s like that Would you like me
to help

JOHN HALL
They were quite public in their
merry making They went later
together to the tavern

SUSANNA
If Judith is reaching for a little
happiness then I am glad of it

JOHN HALL
Sinning will not make her happy

SUSANNA
Really Then let us hope it makes
her unhappiness a little more
bearable

JOHN HALL
That is a wicked thing to say
Remember your scripture

SUSANNA
What I remember is a little girl
who smiled a lot I should like to
see what that smile looks like on
the woman that girl became

All Is True - Shooting Script 59

other half of herself That twin
soul with whom she entered this
world I have asked her for her
hand many times across the years I
don’t know what it was that finally
caused her to say yes all I can
say is that I am happy for it and
my dearest hope on this our wedding

happiness that has forsaken her for
so long

Sir Thomas Lucy walks by

SIR THOMAS
Well well Mr Shakespeare How very
unfortunate Seems your daughters
wedding was rushed for a reason
Like your own eh The apple doesn’t
fall far from the tree Damn me you
Shakespeare’s are a scandalous lot
eh Perhaps being an illiterate
farm girl your wife was unable to
teach your girls morals Well well
Must be getting on Can’t loll
about thinking pretty thoughts all
day like you poets I must to
business

Lucy is about to walk on Will stops him

WILL
Business Sir Thomas
All Is True - Shooting Script 69A

SIR THOMAS
Yes yes business A large estate
like Charlecote Manor doesn’t run
itself ye’ know

WILL
Oh I thought you meant a real
business Like building owning and
operating London’s largest theatre
for instance

Sir Thomas about to speak but Will ploughs on

WILL (CONTD)
Actors carpenters seamstresses
crew Bribes to pay security to
mount politics to navigate
Fifteen hundred paying public each
afternoon to be fed watered and
given a spectacle which must be
ever greater than the last 170
Royal performances for our Queen
and our king Have you ever
considered the cost and logistics
of mounting the Battle of
Shrewsbury in the banqueting hall
at Hampton Court Please don’t It
would make you very very tired
And yet Sir Thomas in all the
years I ran my vast complex and
spectacularly successful business I
also did find time to think and
write down those pretty thoughts
you mentioned which in my
experience brought immense pleasure
to those seeking respite from this
vale of tears and without which
the whole thing would have been as
pointless as Well as pointless
as you Sir Thomas

Will about to leave but then has a final thought

WILL (CONTD)
And since you brought her up my
wife Anne has more wisdom and
decency in her daily shit than you
have in your entire body

Lucy is a little shaken but walks on with dignity Will calls
after him

May I see the Church register

Will looks at the entry for Hamnet’s death The Year 1596
His eye moves up and down the column From the deaths
recorded in 1596 to those in 95 and then 97

All Is True - Shooting Script 72

WILL (CONTD)
Do you mind

Woolmer nods Will begins to cut the quill

WILL (CONTD)
And whenever I cut a new nib I
imagine that my hand is his hand
Grown to be a man

Will watches his hand as he cuts at the quill

WILL (CONTD)
Trimming his quill with the knife
his father gave him - on that
joyful home coming long ago

Will has cut a beautiful nib He dips it in ink

WILL (CONTD)
And when I dip the ink and mark the
page it’s still his hand I see and
the words that I write are his

He writes a word or two

WILL (CONTD)
And then I tell myself that it
isn’t me who thinks of him at all
but that I am dead while Hamnet
lives and thinks of me

Will lays down the quill and folds the knife away Edward
Woolmer glances down at the page Will has written on He
wrote “Hamnet Shakespeare”

WILL (CONTD)
People often ask how I have writ so
much How I found the energy and
dedication to sit alone at my desk
writing play after play after play
The answer’s simple I was always
in the company of my son

He gives way to grief Edward Woolmer stand silently

EXT HOLY TRINITY CHURCH - DAY 159

Will has returned to Hamnet’s grave He reads the inscription
again Year of death 1596

Will glances at the other graves close by the years of death
1594 1597 1597 1598

Will is thinking
All Is True - Shooting Script 73

160 HALL’S CROFT - DAY 160
Will has gone to talk with Susanna

SUSANNA
It began and ended so quickly

WILL
It is always so with the plague

SUSANNA
The four of us had supped that
night We were usually a merry
crowd we four at table but that
night I recall Hamnet was quiet
The illness already in his system
no doubt Judith teased him as she
always did but that night could win
no smile in return

162 INT ANNE IN BED - NIGHT 162

Now it is a flashback we see Anne wake with a start She has
heard Judith’s voice shout “Hamnet” Susanna’s voice over
continues to describe the scene

SUSANNA (VO)
Mother told me she was awoken that
night by Judith’s cry

163 INT JUDITH AND HAMNET IN BED - NIGHT 163

Still in flash back Anne enters the children’s room First
she sees Judith crying in fear Judith points to Hamnet where
he lies already becoming plague ridden

SUSANNA (VO)
Mother bid Hamnet come at once with
her to save Judith from infection

164 EXT THE GREEN WOOD - NIGHT 164

Still in flashback Anne is leading the stricken boy to the
woods

SUSANNA (VO)
She knew already that Hamnet could
not survive and so did her best to
isolate him from all but herself
But Judith disobeyed and followed

Judith is following Anne and Hamnet
All Is True - Shooting Script 74

SUSANNA (VO)
It was a warm night The air was
sweet and Hamnet begged to be taken
to his favourite place

165 INT THE GREEN WOOD POND - NIGHT 165

Hamnet now with pustules fully breaking out lies on the Moon
lit grass beside the water He screams in fear and pain

SUSANNA (VO)
They nursed him through the night
with cool water from the brook and
prayer Mother did as best she
could to keep Judith and herself
from contact with his sores and by
Gods mercy neither was infected

Dawn now Hamnet dies
SUSANNA (VO)
He left them as the Sun rose
Mother sent Judith for blankets and

thread to make a shroud

Cross fade Anne has stitched blankets around the corpse
completely containing it

SUSANNA (VO)
When the plague is involved it’s
best not to linger too long saying
goodbye When I awoke she’d sent

for the graves-men Hamnet was
already in his coffin

167 INT HALL’S CROFT - DAY 167

Back in the present Susanna still with Will

SUSANNA
Judith never smiled again

Will is thinking He sees greater tragedy in his mind even
than that which has been described

168 INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S KITCHEN - EVENING 168
Later Will and Anne before the fire Judith enters

JUDITH
You sent for me Father
All Is True - Shooting Script

WILL
Yes Judith Thank you for coming
Your new home is comfortable I
hope

JUDITH
There’s much to do but my husband
is working hard He is a good man
despite the shame he brought us

Will swallows It’s still a painful memory

WILL
I visited Hamnet’s grave today I
read his name in the Parish
Register

ANNE
I am glad of it

WILL
Anne I have known the plague Many
times in London did it strike and
all the theatres must be closed

Neither Anne or Judith reply

WILL (CONTD)

Yes I have known the plague And I
was thinking today that Black Death
is a scythe it is not a dagger

ANNE
How so

WILL
Never once did I see it strike a
single person and then depart

Anne and Judith remain silent Will is wrestling with a
question he does not want to ask

WILL (CONTD)
How did Hamnet die

Neither Anne nor Judith show any emotion But now we see
tear rolling from Judith’s expressionless eyes

WILL (CONTD)

His death is recorded in the Parish
register but with no mention of the
cause

ANNE
Plague husband The priest
pronounced it at his funeral

All Is True - Shooting Script 76

WILL
Because that is what you told him
And also what no doubt you told the
grave’s men when they arrived in
the greenwood to find him stitched
up in his shroud

In all their minds a remembered scene

INT THE GREENWOOD MORNING 169

Hamnet’s shrouded corpse lies in the grass a sad bundle
Little Judith is being comforted by Anne Two Grave’s men
have arrived Heavily cloaked men wearing the horrible beak
nosed masks used to ward off plague They have a great sheet

They approach the bundled corpse warily Like hook beaked
vultures gathering round carrion They lift it quickly and
fearfully perhaps even manipulating it with hooked poles
Nobody wants to contact with a plaque victim any longer than
necessary They dump it on the sheet and drag the corpse
bundle away

CARD Hamnet Shakespeare died on or around the 9th of August
1596 and was buried on the 11th

INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S KITCHEN - EVENING 170

We are back in the moment Will is still quietly questioning
Anne

WILL

When I look at other graves around
about Hamnet’s and at his name in
the register I see that no scythe
swung through this town in the
summer of 1596 Five children only
were taken and three of those were
new born’s Not like in other
plague years Why in 1597 even
dozens were cut down

(beat)
Wife How did Hamnet die

ANNE
He died of plague

Will stares hard at Anne his heart in torment She returns
his stare with stony defiance Then Judith speaks Slowly
scarcely with emotion Her eyes distant her voice toneless

JUDITH
I woke Mother in the night with my
cry

All Is True - Shooting Script 77

Once more we see the scene in flashback This time described
by Judith in Voice Over

INT ANNE IN BED - NIGHT 171

Again in flashback we see Anne wake with a start She has
heard Judith’s voice shout “Hamnet”

INT JUDITH IN BED - NIGHT 172

Still in flash back Anne enters the children’s room First
she sees Judith crying in fear Judith points but this time
to an empty place in the bed

JUDITH (V0O)
Hamnet’s bed was empty

EXT THE GREENWOOD - NIGHT 173
Still in flashback Anne rushing through the wood

JUDITH (VO)
Mother searched the house and then
thought of the Greenwood Pond that
was his favourite place even though
he couldn’t swim and would never go
in the water

Judith emerges from the house and follows Anne

INT THE GREENWOOD POND - NIGHT 174

Anne approaches the water with Judith behind her They walk
to the edge and now in the Moonlight they see Hamnet dead
floating like Ophelia He is surrounded not by lilies but by
torn pages of paper

JUDITH (VO)
Around him torn and shredded
floated the final verses I had
conjured and which he had writ The
ones prepared for your return

Anne moves towards the water to get Hamnet’s corpse

JUDITH (V0O)
Mother sent me for blankets and
thread So that none would know how
Hamnet died
All Is True - Shooting Script 78

176 INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S KITCHEN - EVENING 176

Back in the present Judith has told her story Anne speaks
with hollow firmness

ANNE
That’s your story Judith and you
have carried it’s burden ever
since But I say he died of plague
The vicar spake it at his grave and
God accepts it Millions have died
of it and Hamnet entered Heaven
amongst that host Jesus would not
have denied him his place whatever
Judith thinks we saw

Will is too broken to speak Instead Judith cries out

JUDITH
Of course he’s in Heaven Hamnet
didn’t kill himself he only threw
himself upon the water It was I
that caused it I killed him I
killed my brother

ANNE
No Judith It isn’t so

Judith turns to Will utterly distraught

JUDITH
He wanted to please you so much
All he cared about was your love
and all you cared about was him I
was jealous I was jealous
Hamnet went to school I helped in
the kitchen because I was a girl I
wanted your approval too I wanted
your love

Will is numb

JUDITH (CONTD)
So I told him I would tell you
That this time you would know which
twin had writ the verse I didn’t
mean it I wouldn’t have done it I
loved him But he believed me He
couldn’t face your disappointment

Judith sobs in abject misery Anne comforts Judith
ANNE
He died of plague Judith God
accepts that It was only a little
lie He was only a little boy

Will gets up unsteadily puts on his cloak and leaves

All Is True - Shooting Script 79

EXT THE GREEN WOOD - NIGHT 177
A wild night Will stumbles through the woods He calls out

WILL
Hamnet

He thinks he sees the Boy again Somewhere in the woods The
boy runs Will crashes after him Rain lashing down

Will has arrived at the pond He stares at he still Moon lit
water Almost delirious he grabs at a rock and puts it in his
shirt Gathering another he wades into the water When it is
deep enough he plunges under

The rocks aren’t heavy enough He surfaces but plunges again
Then he sees the boy standing on the bank

The boy smiles Will stops He stands waste deep in the
water

BOY
You finished it

Will doesn’t understand

BOY (CONTD)
My story’s done
Go home now
I can rest

Will reaches out his hand

WILL
Hamnet please Stay a moment

BOY
We are such stuff
As dreams are made on and our
little life
Is rounded with a sleep

The boy is gone

EXT THE HIGH STREET - EARLY MORNING 178

A few people are up and about Milk churns are being carted
Bread baked Will walks home through the town a filthy and
disheveled figure soaked through A stark contrast to the
proud man in his fine clothes A few faces turn
All Is True - Shooting Script 80

179 EXT NEW PLACE - MORNING 179

Will arrives home a sorry shivering figure Anne opens the
door to him She looks on him with pity and with love Will
seems so diminished

WILL
I think perhaps I have caught a
little chill

CARD In April 1616 Shakespeare was visited by his friend and
rival Ben Jonson

180 INT THE SHAKESPEARE’S HALL - NIGHT 180

Will wrapped in rugs and seeming rather ill is dining with
Jonson

JONSON
Christ Will You have had a time of
it Both daughters caught up in
scandals Good for them

WILL
Yes So far retirement hasn’t
exactly brought me the peace I’d
hoped for

Jonson sups deep He is a confident bold opinionated man
but also astute and he loves Will

JONSON
In my experience Will no one ever
gets what they hope for But they
do tend to get what they deserve

WILL
You think I got what I deserve

JONSON
Not all of it perhaps but something
certainly You lost a son No man
deserves that but most men suffer
it I myself have lost a daughter
and a son

WILL
I know my friend

JONSON
But you have two daughters still
who love you and a wife to share
your bed I have none of that Mine
own Anne despises me
All Is True - Shooting Script

WILL
Well you publicly insult her and
call her ‘shrew’ Can you blame
her

JONSON
I didn’t say she had no cause only
that she does Like your Anne
(wife) She loves William
Shakespeare But she won’t put up
with the monster You tell me that
Southampton says you’ve lived a
little life What an arse You have
conquered England and returned
victorious to the bosom of your
family Is that little

WILL
Perhaps the second part

JONSON
The second part is the best part
You made it home Will How many
other conquerors can say as much
What poets Anyone can die alone
and despised Marlowe was murdered
and no one can agree on which of
his many enemies did it Greene
died in poverty estranged from all
who knew him Kyd the same No one
knows how Tom Nashe died but if his
filthy dildo poem’s are anything to
go by it wasn’t in the bosom of his
family

Will laughs which brings on a coughing fit

JONSON (CONTD)
And I Well while I am not dead I
may soon be for I am out of favour
with the king and none will speak
for me But you Will You made it
home Any of us might wish we had
half your ‘littleness’

WILL
(chuckling)
Well perhaps put like that

JONSON
You have kept your friends too
even me and I am a waspish fellow
Hemming and Condell are feverishly
seeking out your scripts intent
that all should be published and
your genius be preserved down the
ages

JONSON (CONTD)
Name another writer the bloody
actors have revered like that Yes
we tease you Will I’ve done it
myself A lot ‘Not without right’
180c

Will puts a bit of mustard on his ham in salute

All Is True - Shooting Script

WILL
Or as you kindly put it publicly
“Not without Mustard”

JONSON
But you have your family and your
friends a full fire and a full
belly And oh by the way you have
written the greatest body of plays
that ever were or will be Damn
your eyes you bastard Yes my
friend I think you got what you
deserved

Will is much moved by all of this

WILL
Ben I have an idea

EXT JUDITH’S CHAMBER WINDOW- NIGHT

WILL
Were going to the pub Wanna come

EXT NEW PLACE - NIGHT

180c

Will and Jonson both drunk have got a ladder and Jonson and

are setting it beneath Will’s Coat of Arms Judith stops

them

JUDITH
You’re both too drunk for ladders
Just hold the bottom

The pregnant Judith begins to climb
All Is True - Shooting Script 83

182 EXT THE HIGH STREET - NIGHT 182

The two playwrights and Judith are making their way tipsily
up the street carrying the Coat of Arms

183 INT THE TAVERN - NIGHT 183

They enter and to everyone’s astonishment plonk it on the
bar

WILL
The Shakespeare Coat of Arms It
cost me twenty quid Who wants it
for nothing

General surprise Judith smiles She understands what this
means to Will

WILL (CONTD)
Hang it above the bar if you wish
for I have no more need of it You
all know me anyway I’m the son of
a dodgy trader and my wife was
three months knocked up when I took
her to the altar One of my girls
married a carnal copulator no
offense Jude

JUDITH
None taken Father he did tell the
entire town

WILL
And the other one married a
Puritan

JUDITH
Which personally I think is worse

WILL
Here here

JONSON
Bloody right

WILL
Some people think I poached one of
Lucy’s stags which I didn’t but I
wish I had

JUDITH
And never mind stags anyway you
once stole an entire theatre

WILL
Very true
183a

All Is True - Shooting Script 84

JONSON
I was there

WILL
I worked too hard drank too little
and worried too much about what
arseholes like you lot thought of
me

Good natured cheers

WILL (CONTD)
I took my extremely long suffering
wife for granted neglected my
beautiful clever daughters

He looks at Judith who returns his smile

WILL (CONTD)
And expected too much of my beloved
son Apart from all that I wrote
37 plays some of which I admit
were rather long but all of which
are works of absolute genius
Except possibly The Two Gentlemen
of Verona

WILL (CONTD)
My name is William Shakespeare And
I am not a gentleman

All cheer Judith hugs Will The party begins

EXT NEW PLACE DAWN 183a

A crisp spring morning

INT ANNES’S BEDROOM - MORNING 184

Will lies in bed He’s weak and ill The chill is worse He’s
dying Anne Judith and Sue enter Judith now showing her
pregnancy

JUDITH
Father It’s a special day And
Mother and Sue have prepared a
special present

Susanna takes a document and hands it to him

WILL
Goodness What’s this

ANNE

years ago I put my mark to it

All Is True - Shooting Script 85

SUSANNA
And now

There is a little bureau Susanna produces quill and ink
Anne sits and with great care signs the licence

ANNE
Anne Shakespeare

Will smiles and looks at the licence

WILL
You have a beautiful hand

JUDITH
Sue is teaching me also and by the
time you are better I shall have
written you a poem

Will smiles with deep and special pleasure

WILL
You will need a pen knife then
This is yours

Will takes Hamnet’s knife from his pocket and gives it her

SUSANNA
And what should you like to do
today Father On this special day

He smiles He is at peace

WILL
I know a bank where the wild thyme
blows

As the poem continues in voice over

EXT THE GARDEN - MORNING 185

It is beautiful now a graphic maze garden of beautifully
arranged grasses A knot garden of charm and symmetry The
ladies lead Will to a seat and gather around him while little
Elizabeth plays Standing apart but also included are Hall
and Quiney

WILL (VO)

Where oxlips and the nodding violet
grows

Quite overcanopied with luscious
woodbine

With sweet musk roses and with
eglantine

There sleeps Titania sometime of
the night

where he was born It was his birthday

186 INT HOLY TRINITY CHURCH - DAY 186
It is Will’s funeral Music A sombre respectful
congregation Now Anne Judith and Susanna stand together at
the dais They have a piece of paper First Anne reads it is
a little faltering but loud and proud

ANNE
Fear no more the heat o the sun

Judith reads the second line Also falteringly It is
heartbreakingly poignant Anne and Judith finally beginning
to read Will’s poetry

JUDITH
Nor the furious winters rages

Now Susanna takes over She of course reads with confidence
and beautiful clarity
SUSANNA
Thou thy worldy task hast done
Home art gone and ta’en thy wages
Golden lads and girls all must
As chimney sweepers come to dust

As the verses continue we move away down the church and
fade to black
