FADE IN
We roll credits over-

Peal tight on a pattern of brown and black textures The
image begins to shake Slow motion Graceful

WE HEAR a low rhythmic THUMP THUMP THUMP

The surface slowly peels off like flecks of dried old paint
as we pull back a little wider and realize that were looking
at an OLD DOOR

THUMP THUMP THUMP

The door continues to rattle Something or someone is behind
it desperately fighting to get out
THUMP THUMP THUMP

Wider still to include the rusted worn doorknob twisting
back and forth and shaking Whatever is in there -- its
locked inside

this flop-house apartment

Te take in the scene A young WOMAN mid-twenties lies on an
old mattress tossed on the floor in the center of the room

Our YOUNG WOMAN (AMY KLEIN) moving through the party She
reaches into the pocket of her long black coat and lifts out
a TAPE RECORDER She clicks it on and slips it back into her
pocket

THE MAN from our opening shot offers her some X She lets him
place it on her tongue and then she swallows it He smiles
pleased and turns to leave She quickly but slyly removes
the X from her mouth and flicks it away F

get weird here as the crack pipe starts to make its way
around the room

for another hit all the while studying the other partiers
with a keen reporters eye

Later After everyone has left The sun is coming up Amy
alone with the MAN Hes half-naked on the mattress trying
to pull Amy close Amys looking for a safe exit but shes
stayed too long and hes starting to get a little rough with
her A wrong move now could push him over the edge

head and he passes out

Back to scene as Amys eyes flutter open quickly adjusting

to her unfamiliar surroundings She freezes for a beat then
after determining that the Man is asleep she slides her way
off the mattress and rolls quietly onto the floor

hes relieved when she finds that shes still dressed

She snatches a small TAPE RECORDER off the ground and clicks
rewind -- satisfied

She snatches a half empty pack of smokes off the floor and
shes gone

EXT A BUILDING ON THE LOWER EAST SIDE OF LONDON - DAY

A big sign identifies this old brick building as the home of
The London Underground -- a weekly newspaper in the
Village Voice mode only scuzzier

INT OFFICES OF THE UNDERGROUND - DAY
MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

A pair of elevator doors open AMY KLEIN exits and walks
towards camera Shes all in black from her black sneakers
and black stockings up to her tinted glasses and jet black
hair The only thing about her that isnt black is a
complexion so translucently pale that it bespeaks only the
most rare and grudging familiarity with daylight She has a
paper coffee cup and a cigarette in the same hand and she
alternates sips of coffee with puffs of her cigarette with a
practiced proficiency She ignores the unhappy looks of her
fellow employees She clearly has practice at this as well
Little office cubbies scattered around a converted loft
space Too Hip EMPLOYEES sit at their desks typing at
computers conferring at tables -- going about the business
of turning out another issue They point and whisper as Amy
walks by

Amy passes another cubicle as A YOUNG REPORTER holds the
newspapers FRONT PAGE up in front of Amy A big headline
reads How to be a Crack Whore written over a photo of a
crack den in which we glimpse things better left unseen
Beneath the headline is written A special report by Amy

Betty gives a broad gesture over her shoulder pointing
toward the Editors office across the work space Amy heads
across the way toward the office Betty picks up the phone

NT CHARLES RICKMANS OFFICE - DAY

CHARLES RICKMAN the Editor-in-Chief is an Englishman in his
early forties sporting a pony tail which like a moustache
on a sixteen-year-old only serves to emphasize his true age
Hes fiddling around with some sort of TVVCR set up and is
looking away from the door as it opens and Amy enters behind
him

CHARLES
(without turning)
Ah I detect that unique and ubiquitous
combination of female sweat and patchouli
oil that signals the arrival of

He turns toward a dour Amy

CHARLES
the delightful and world-famous Amy
Klein Have a seat angel of light

AMY
Eat me Charles

CHARLES
Its exactly that lack of respect for
authority that got you fired from the New
York Post

AMY
I wasnt fired I was re-assigned

CHARLES
Of course Where would you be without me
By the way I dont recall ever being
thanked properly for this re-
assignment

Charles makes air quotes with his fingers

CHARLES (CONTD)
Lucky for you I opened my doors to you
here as soon as I heard you were
available

More air quotes Amy walks over to a trophy table where
she looks over a cluster of framed photos She points to one
of her and Charles smiling together More innocent times
for both
AMY
I seem to recall a rather similar
reassignment with you Charles

CHARLES
Touche Well thanks to international
conglomerates and the Euro-dollar I
along with Mother England am blessed
with your acquaintance yet again

AMY
Hey a contracts a contract

She holds up the cassette recorder
AMY (CONTD)

Look if all this about me being late
with the crack whore story Its all right

CHARLES
(interrupting)

Its not about the crack whores Im sure
youre working your usual unrestrained
insightful magic on what Im certain will
be another eye-opening expose I expect
nothing but brilliance -- in five
thousand words or less

(beat)
But this is better

Amy spots an open container of Chinese food on Charless
desk She inspects it then picks something out of it with a
pair of chop sticks

AMY
So what then Are we being sued again

CHARLES
Hmm Oh no
(sees her eating)
Please feel free to have some of that

AMY
Thanks What is this General Tsos cat

CHARLES
Spare me the Nothing comes close to New
York Chinese speech just this once Go

show you

He heads back over to the VCR Amy ditches the Chinese food
and picks up her coffee again She sits lights another
cigarette

CHARLES
Okay rewind rewind Rewind

He finds the button presses it and turns back to Amy

CHARLES
Somebody mailed us this thing around two
weeks ago but in keeping with our usual
level of efficiency Betty didnt get
around to opening it “til this morning
Then she brought it to me

AMY
What is it

Charles closes the door

AMY
Whats the matter This X-rated or

CHARLES
Something Amy with your encyclopedic
world-wide knowledge of skank-ology --

AMY
Oh sure Theyre generally in their
forties kind of ex-hippy types They

CHARLES

You see ‘em in the park sometimes

CHARLES
Love of my life go screw yourself Im
asking you a serious question

AMY
No Charles Ive never heard of
Deaders

CHARLES

Watch the tape

Charles goes to the VCR and hits the play button Amy
finishes her coffee and lights a new cigarette with the still-
glowing butt of her last one She leans forward

ON THE TAPE

The image flickers into view Its handheld low-rez clearly
been shot in some dingy apartment somewhere decorated in a
mattresses on the floorbeer spray on the walls type decor
There are around half a dozen PEOPLE there in their twenties
and younger They drift in and out of frame in and out of
focus

We hear a womans voice -- clearly the person who is
operating the camera as the shot moves about the room This
is MARLA CHEN
MARLA
(off screen)
Okay okay Here we go Theres Anna

The camera hesitates for a fleeting moment on ANNA a girl
with bright dye-red hair (on the side of her head that isnt
shaved) Anna looks with no particular expression and goes
away

The camera turns toward a smudged mirror on the wall and we
get a look at Marla a twenty-ish Asian girl

MARLA
Heres Marla Chen official Deader
Archivist Hello me

he camera turns toward a door as it opens and KATYA a young
round-faced girl with dark hair comes out looking a bit
nervous

MARLA
(off screen)
And heres the star of the show Katya

She gives a little smile The camera swings over toward a
mattress on the floor Some of the people are tugging a
plastic sheet over it One of them and the one who clearly

appears to be in authority -- a man with albino-like features
-- WINTER
MARLA
And heres our deader bed -- this is the

scene of the crime Crime to be

he camera moves in on Winter

MARLA
And here is the fearless leader of the
Deaders Winter

Winter glances up then dismisses the camera altogether He
looks off screen then raises his hand The room quiets We
hear various voices

VOICES
Shh Quiet Were starting

Winter looks up and the camera swings toward Katya She
hesitates A girl next to her starts to prompt her

WINTER
Do you become one of us of your own free
will

KATYA
Yes

WINTER
Are you afraid

KATYA
Yes

WINTER
Good Fear is the place we go to learn

She hesitates

ATYA

(reciting)
My skin isnt real My eyes arent real
My muscles arent real My bones my
heart my veins and nerves and flesh and
meat arent real What I see what I
hear what I taste what I touch what I
remember what I think what I feel
arent real

WINTER
(off screen)
Go on

KATYA
Im not real

The camera swings back to Winter who gestures for her to
come forward then swings back to see her coming

The various people in the room gather around as she comes to
the mattress The camera moves this way and that trying to
get the best angle to cover the action People spread towels
on the mattress over the plastic as Katya naked sits down
on the towels then lays back flat on the mattress

inter looks to the Black Kid standing next to him He comes
up with a big handgun -- maybe a 45

KATYA
Im not real

The camera moves in closer as Winter takes the gun and slips
it into Katyas hand

KATYA
Im not Im not real

he slides the gun over and puts it to the side of her head

AMY

Sits forward in her seat not quite believing what shes
seeing

AMY
Holy Charles

CHARLES
Just keep watching

ON THE TAPE

Katya is breathing fast now but we cant be sure if its
terror or passion or some combination of both She
continues to lie on the mattress the barrel of the gun
pressed against the side of her head

KATYA
Im not real Im not

Winter reaches out hesitant and cocks the gun in her hand
Meanwhile we see other hands reaching in pressing a folded
up towel against the opposite side of her head Other hands
come in and press a doubled-over pillow against the towel

KATYA
Im not real Im not Im not

She closes her eyes grits her teeth Her back arches
AMY

drops her cigarette as it burns down to her fingers She

stands

ON THE TAPE

Katya holds her breath and pulls the trigger

Theres
through
tearing
catch a

We hear

a huge CONCUSSION as the bullet tears straight

her head We can see it splatter out the other side
through the towel and the folded over pillow which
great blast of bone and brain

some screams in the room

AMY jumps back

AMY
Have you called the police on this

CHARLES
Just watch

AMY
I want to know if youve called the
pol

CHARLES
I said Just watch

AMY

Oh man dont tell me that was some
special effect

CHARLES
You tell me

AMY
This is sick

CHARLES
Thats saying a lot for you
The camera is now pointing at Winter There is a look of deep
tenderness in his face as he circles around and kneels down
staring toward Katya who is lying as dead as dead can be
on the mattress Blood has run from the ghastly wound down
both sides of the plastic and towels on the side of the bed
catch the mess

Winter reaches down and gently removes the gun from Katyas
lifeless hand and then light as a feather lies down on
top of her

The camera moves forward and down as Marla presumably
elbows her way through for a better vantage point The camera
moves in close as Winter stretches out along Katyas body

He places his lips on her forehead kissing her lightly then
presses his lips against hers -- kissing her -- or maybe
something else It seems almost as if hes breathing into
her His body moves as his lungs expand and expel and he

seems to be struggling toward some non-sexual climax
AMY watches both repelled and fascinated

ON THE TAPE

Winter continues his odd ritual finally taking a great final
breath as if hes reached the point of exhaustion and
expels it Nothing happens

He leans in close

WITH AMY

Amy leans in close as well

WITH WINTER

He draws in another breath -- he seems to be in agony as he
does it -- presses his lips to Katyas dead ones and
exhales The breath seems to go on forever -- longer than it

should
And then when it seems as if Winter cant breathe out
another teaspoon of air Katyas body abruptly twitches
beneath him -- and then she sucks in a ragged breath Her
previously open and lifeless eyes move Her head raises up

WITH AMY

She simply stares breathing again for the first time ina
moment unable to quite take in what shes seeing

ON THE SCREEN

Winter exhausted looks down at Katya smiling Theres
nervous laughter sounds of relief from around the room
Winter slides off of her Katya looks this way and that
presumably at the others looking down at her

A hand reaches down and she takes it The camera follows as
Winter pulls her unsteadily up to standing All this despite
the fact that there is still an exceedingly large and obvious
hole in her head the size of a dime on one side the size
of a half-dollar on the other

The others move in touching her congratulating her Shes
still a bit shaky uncertain Then she lifts one of her hands
to the side of her head -- the side with the big exit wound
She touches it gingerly confirming that it is really there

Then she slowly slides her fingers IN They penetrate her
skull unobstructed to the second knuckle Katya takes her
fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at them bloody
Yet shes alive Fine

She looks up at the others then smiles widely The others
move in giving her hugs pecks on the cheek

She touches the wound again She starts laughing

KATYA
(as if actually realizing) it)
Im fine

K
She touches the wound again
ATYA
I feel great

She starts laughing

KATYA
Oh man Oh man

The image cuts off goes to snow There is a moment of
silence Amy turns to Charles

AMY
What the hell

CHARLES
Thats what I said

AMY
Have you have you found any of
these

CHARLES

I havent done anything I told you I
just looked at it today By some chance
are you interested in pursuing this

Amy hesitates shaking her head not sure what its all
about

CHARLES
Look Amy Maybe this is just some kind
of bull-shit shot-on-tape gore movie And
since thats all it can be thats all
youre going find but it sure smells
different to me If its bull-shit
youll know pretty fast If its not

Amy though is only half listening lost in her own
thoughts

AMY
How could she

CHARLES
Who said miracles can only happen at
Lourdes
Who said they happen there

She lifts her fingers to the side of her head duplicating
the action of Katya slipping her fingers inside the wound

HARLES
Amy you know what my father said
once
AMY

That all writers were queers

CHARLES
No that was a different time This time
we were driving down the block and there
was this fortune-telling place you know
this gypsy fortune telling place ina
store front And he said You know if I
could tell the future I wouldnt be
living in any crappy store front

He looks back at the tape

CHARLES
If I could do that I wouldnt be hanging
out in some rundown basement Id own the
earth

AMY
Maybe theyre just getting started

CHARLES
Maybe

AMY
What else do we have besides the tape

CHARLES
Just a return address on the envelope

He holds up the envelope which is addressed to AMY KLEIN CO
THE UNDERGROUND Amy hesitates Snatches the envelope out of
his hand She reads the return address

CHARLES
Looks like your online fan-base is
growing Its an address in Bucharest
Its where all the Euro-trash kids
looking for a good time are heading these
days Amsterdam is so 90s

Shes shocked that he would even know

AMY
Why Charles

CHARLES
I still like to keep my finger on the
pulse even though I know you think I
dont have one

She thinks about it He hands her a thick envelope

CHARLES
Your ticket hotel and per diem

She smiles

AMY
You know me too well

CHARLES
Its what keeps me up at night
(beat)
Now heres the part where Im supposed to
say be careful Be careful

AMY
Always

CHARLES
Call me when you get settled

She just smirks and exits

EXT EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

STOCK FOOTAGE a train rolling through the countryside

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
SUPER TITLE BUCHAREST

A cab pulls up to the front of the building Amy gets out and
walks up to the front door

She pulls an envelope out of her bag Its the one that the
tape came in She checks the name on the envelope -- MARLA
CHEN Compares it to a name on the mailboxes

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Amy walks past the lobby and up the stairs

INT THE SECOND FLOOR - DAY

Amy makes her way down the narrow dark hallway and finds the
appropriate door She knocks at it No answer

She looks down and sees a lone fly crawl out from under the
door Then another follows and another She kneels down to
inspect it

She leans forward and sniffs The results are inconclusive
Then she lays herself flat down on the floor presses her
nose up against the bottom of the door and sniffs

The smell of dead wretched air is overwhelming

And thats when a large WORN SHOE steps into frame right in
front of Amy

MANAGER (0C)
(irritated with appropriate
accent)

Have you lost something

Amy leaps up in one quick move to find herself face to face
with THE MANAGER an older man whos a little winded from his
climb up here Between his teeth he clenches a half chewed
three quarter smoked cigar The smoke seeps through his
yellowed teeth

Yes I ah

She pats her pockets Then tries another tactic
AMY
No Im looking for my sister Marla
Chen

MANAGER
Youre not Chinese

AMY
Shes my half sister Same Mom Different
Dads I havent heard from her in two
weeks so I got nervous

The Manager stares at her in disbelief Knows shes up to
something Amy sniffs the air coming from the room again

AMY
Does it always smell like this in here

The Manager blows a bloom of smoke out of his nostrils He
yanks the cigar from his mouth and sniffs Doesnt seem that
bad to him

MANAGER
Like what

AMY
Look Marla is a friend of mine and
shes missing

my pulls a few American bills from her pocket

AMY
I need five minutes in there Then Ill
know what I need to know

The Manager stares at the money for a beat then stares back
at Amy He bites down on his cigar and snatches it out of her
hand

MANAGER
Five minutes

He pulls out his ring of keys and unlocks the door
Amy enters The place is dark and cold Eerily quiet The
manager stays in the hallway he looks at Amy and taps his
watch Amy nods as he pulls the door closed

She descends down the dark hallway Her face tightens as she
takes in the deathly ripe air The BUZZING of flies getting
louder with each step

As she approaches a room she recoils clutching her face
from the stench She inhales -- drawing in the smell to
acclimate herself -- and almost vomits She steadies herself
drawing in breaths through her nose tentative at first and
finally in larger breaths until she can tolerate it

he looks back toward the entry door she is alone

INT MARLAS ROOM - DAY

Amy steps in and stops struggling to keep herself from
retching

No sign of anything dead No sound except the sinister
buzzing of flies Amy steps cautiously in

She looks toward one side sees a closet with a double
sliding door She slides open one side sees nothing that
shouldnt be there -- a ragged winter jacket a green plastic
raincoat a hangar festooned with scarfs some other garments
still obscured beneath cleaning bag plastic

She hesitates then calmly slides the other side open More
of the same

She turns in the other direction Theres a little kitchen
Nothing dead there She starts forward then turns back --
staring at the refrigerator She goes quickly over and tugs
it open Its empty Not so much as a ketchup bottle
Curious she opens the freezer The same Empty

She heads through the living room and down a narrow corridor
leading to another bedroom At the end of the hallway is a
bathroom The door to the bathroom is open and the toilet on
the far wall faces the door
Marla is there

Dressed only in bra and panties she is sitting on the closed
lid of the john leaning forward in what seems at first to
be an impossible angle Her hands hang forward almost
touching the floor Her head is cocked back staring up Her
skin is gray swollen

Amy takes a few steps forward for a better look As she
approaches she sees the reason for the odd position of the
body

A long boot-lace has been tied around Marlas neck and tied
to the wall pipe on the toilet The flesh of her neck has
swollen out almost burying the boot-lace She has hanged
herself in this ghastly way

Amy takes another step forward As she does theres a sudden
loud buzzing as the flies that crawl on Marla abruptly rise
up alarmed (or whatever it is flies are) at her approach
But they soon return to the corpse crawling about the face
around the edges of the glazed eyes around the margins of
the open mouth rimmed with dry foam -- around the out-thrust
tongue

Amy covers her mouth with her shirt trying to filter out the
stench She backs away from the body and into another room

IN THE BEDROOM

Amy starts to search -- fast thorough -- shes done this
sort of thing before She finds a journal opens it no
writing She tosses it aside Pulls open a drawer She tugs
out what looks like a blade-less knife handle She presses a
stud A STILETTO BLADE SPRINGS OUT She tosses it back in the
drawer tugs some other stuff into view

Some bills some shoelaces loose change She goes drawer to
drawer looking for anything that might mean something
Socks ragged underwear cheap jewelry tee shirts and short
skirts and jeans
Amy stops surveying the territory Where to look next Then
deciding she goes to the bed

She reaches under it sliding her hand around tugs out a
dust-encrusted skirt Feels around some more hesitates
pulls something else out She brings it out into view Its a
desiccated mouse She grimaces and tosses it back under the
bed in disgust

She stops then slides her hand between the mattress and
the box spring She feels around then stops finding
something She pulls out a little red paper folder -- the

kind that photographs come from She opens it

It appears to be a photographic record of another deader
party We see some of the same participants -- we also see
Marla herself in some of the pictures Shes smiling Amy
flips the next photograph

It shows Marla next to Winter Hes holding something in his
hand Amy looks closer THE PUZZLE BOX -- Amy turns another
photograph and it shows somebody holding the box out in front
of Marla

The picture is framed through a length of rope with a noose
on one end Marla is on the other side-- Almost a kind of
Joke photo

She has a kind of sickly smile on her face Amys eyes
narrow She holds the picture closer There seems to be a
figure lost in shadows and the closer she looks the more
reality merges with the grains of the photo What is there A
man

Amy hears a scratching noise coming from outside the room
She stuffs the book in her satchel

Amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the
unseen bathroom She sits silent waiting

Then the sound of the scratching comes again The sound of
flies rising -- and again more distinct -- something
scratching She keeps her position still listening Nothing
Just the slow steady untroubled buzzing
She moves toward the bathroom

And again theres the tiny scratching and the rush of sound
as if something has disturbed the flies

The sound stops The flies are still except for the
occasional buzz

She advances until she can glimpse the edge of one of
Marlas hanging out-thrust hands the tip of one finger just
touching the floor Marlas long fingernails are painted
green

THE BATHROOM

She comes around the edge of the bathroom door Marla is
motionless

She leans from the pipe by the shoelace The shoelace is
still buried in her throat The flies buzz up again The
glazed eyes remain fixed in their sockets One of her hands
is not visible from Amys position We see scratches on the
floor beneath her fingernails

Amy steels herself -- and then walks closer On the corner of
the sink theres a thick manila envelope with something
bulky inside -- something that looks just like a cassette
tape Theres a name written on it and the marker is right
next to it It reads AMY

Amy must reach past the corpse in order to reach the
envelope horribly close to the body in doing so

She enters the cramped space and reaches toward the sink She
is about six inches shy of grabbing it She notices that her
hip is almost touching Marlas face as she leans The flies
stir The stench rises

She stretches closer and Marlas body is pushed aside a few
inches Closer and closer AMY reaches

Her outstretched fingers just manage to touch the envelope
She pitches it and pulls it toward her
It falls off the sink and onto the floor behind Marla

Now Amy must kneel and reach past Marla face She holds her
breath as she reaches long and far

She manages to grab the envelope but her face is almost
cheek to cheek with the rotting corpse As she pulls the
envelope up she notices something else in Marlas hidden
hand

THE PUZZLE BOX

Amy reaches over and pries open Marlas hand Her blackened
fingers snap as they are pulled off the box Amy grabs the
box and envelope stuffs them into her bag and stands

As she stands next to Marlas body suddenly-
MARLAS HAND GRABS AMYS LEG

Amy shrieks and swats the dead hand away falling backward
onto the floor as she does She rolls over and in a half-
crawl half-scramble gets herself back up to her feet

Amy backs up against a wall kicking Marla as she kicks the
floor We cant tell if Marla is moving from the kicks or if
she is somehow alive Either way its to much for Amy She
stops moving

Marlas mouth emits a ghastly sound as a stream of liquid
falls to the floor Its almost as if she is trying to speak

Amy has seen enough Up she goes as she tears down the hall
through the living room and SMACK INTO THE MANAGER

Which needless to say scares the shit out of her Hes
standing inside the now open door to the apartment

AMY
Shes dead

MANAGER
Dead

AMY

Dead She hung herself in the bathroom
Call the police

The Manager grabs Amy by the arm He pulls the cigar from his
mouth and points it in her direction Amy hears police sirens
in the background

MANAGER
Already did Who are you
(pointing his cigar at Amys
satchel)
What do you have in there

In a flash Amy twists her arm out of his grasp and slings
her knee up into his nuts He doubles over

INT THE HALL AND STAIRWAY - DAY

Amy comes flying down the hall at top speed She reaches the
top of the stairs and starts down and as she does her
feet slip

She slides down five or six steps then over-balances
throwing out her hands to keep her chin from hitting the
polished stone steps She keeps sliding down finally over-
balancing again flipping over and landing on her back on the
landing half-way between the floors
A
MY
Dammit

The Manager looks down the stairs for her He doesnt even
attempt to chase her

MANAGER
Stop her

He curses her in his native tongue

EXT SIDEWALK - DAY

Amy breaks through the doors of the building She hits two of
the ten stairs down to the sidewalk People walking by hardly
notice

Up ahead a police car is turning down the street She stops
and walks calmly diverting her eyes The police car races
by and Amy walks faster and faster then runs

INT AMYS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Close on a tray of ice being cracked apart Its contents
poured into a open towel

Amy is sitting on the floor in front of her couch now
dressed in only panties and a bra -- an image unpleasantly
reminiscent of Marla -- especially with the spotting of
bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin

She has a dripping ice pack in one hand which she applies to
this bruise and that -- and a bottle of gin in the other She
doesnt look happy She takes a drink then looks toward a TV
and VCR in front of her

Theres a tape half-inserted into the VCR We can see the
empty envelope with AMY written on it lying on the floor

he tape is within reach of Amys bare foot and she lifts a
toe toward it hesitant She puts her toe against the
tapehanging on the edge of decision Finally she shoves
it forward with her toe

It slides into the machine She grabs up the remote and turns
on the set The IMAGE appears

Its Marla looking like she hasnt slept in days sitting on
a chair in her apartment staring into camera Her eyes are
glazed distant But she looks a hell of lot better than she
did in the bathroom

MARLA
(a little sad)
I knew youd come Course if youre
watching this tape its already too late
for me But maybe you can stop it

Amy removes the PUZZLE BOX from her satchel Stares at it
MARLA

He promised us pleasures beyond anything
we could ever imagine We just had to
fight through the pain first Easier said
than done

(beat)
Dont open the box Amy If you do Winter
wins and if he wins-

Someone pounds on a door Marla panics

MARLA
(hurried)
Go to Pletkow station at midnight Go to
the south end of the platform and step
onto the last car Find a guy named Joey
who runs the show and tell him I sent
you Hell guide you to them

The POUNDING GETS LOUDER

WINTER (0S)
Marla

MARLA
Save them Amy Please

WINTER (0S)
Marla

Marla leaps forward and-

MARLA
Those you trust the most -- trust the
least

- shuts off the camera It goes black for a few seconds and
then cuts to snow

Amy sits staring at the snow her face empty She sets the
PUZZLE BOX on the table and stares at it Takes a sip of her
drink

AMY (TO HERSELF)
Dont open it Right

phone rings It shakes Amy out of her fugue
She leans over picks up the receiver An old style phone

AMY
Yeah

INT CHARLES RICKMANS OFFICE - NIGHT

Charles sits at his desk He is twisting pencils in a small
plastic sharpener

(Intercut conversation)

CHARLES
Dont tell me I woke you up I wont
believe that

AMY
You know I dont sleep when Im working
What do you want Charles

CHARLES
You were supposed to call me

AMY
You know me I dove right in I was
gonna call you tomorrow

CHARLES

The thing is I started thinking
AMY

You know thats never a good thing

Charles

Amy looks at the Puzzle box on the table It seems to be
reflecting the snow of the TV set in some strange form

She looks closer its an ABSTRACT IMAGE OF A LITTLE GIRL
SCREAMING She compares it to the TV set it shows only
white static snow

CHARLES
Look I know the crazy stuff you do fora
story

AMY

Thats what I get paid for
CHARLES
And thats why I hired you Its just
Just the thing is Amy some things
you shouldnt do you know what I mean

Charles finishes a pencil and blows off the shavings

AMY
Like what

CHARLES
Look I say this to you but in my heart
I know that one time its going to
happen that youre going to end up I
dont know -- dead or god knows what But
when it does happen I dont want it to
be my fault

She watches the image of the little girl fade

AMY
Okay Charles Ill make sure it wont
be
CHARLES

You know youre messing with my
conscience here Amy

AMY
Charles I cant do the sensitive thing
I dont know how I get the message I
knew the message before I got it Okay
Mommy Youve had a change of heart You
want me to come home Well I cant Not
until I know the truth So there Youre
off the hook I gotta go

INT AMYS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Amy hangs up She waits a moment hesitates -- then takes the
PUZZLE BOX from the table She begins to explore its edges
with her fingers rolling it over and over in her hands
It starts to unlock

She jumps as it begins to change shape and sets it back on
the table Light seems to emanate from within as it clicks
into another form The table beneath it seems tremble the
ice in her drink taps against the edge of the glass

figure appears in the darkness behind her PINHEAD Here we
go folks-

THE PHONE RINGS She nearly leaps out of the chair striking
the puzzle box with her hand The Puzzle Box closes

PINHEAD vanishes back into the shadows

AMY
Charles I get the message OK Your my
editor not my Mommy
(long beat)
Charles

Amy waits But theres no sound

AMY
Hello Hello

A sound comes over the line -- a hoarse gurgling sound - a
ghastly wet sound - the same sound Amy heard coming from the
throat of the hanged Marla

MARLA
(through phone wet choking
voice)
Dont open

The line goes dead She shoves the whole phone away from her
She sits breathing fast for a second staring at the box
Quiet Only the sound of the snow on the TV

She stands and pulls her pants on
INT SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

A thunderous noise trails a subway car as it streaks out of a
station

Lit with cold fluorescent light Amy now dressed with her
sunglasses in place slides her card through the slot and
shoves through the turnstile She descends the long non-
working escalator -- the only one on it at this time of
night

She reaches the subway platform It is virtually empty

Amy has come down stairs that land her just about in the
middle She scans the far end of the platform past a lone
FIGURE in a SHINY GREEN PLASTIC RAINCOAT who lies motionless
on a bench

- a couple MIDDLE-AGED GUYS in security uniforms maybe
heading for some night shift somewhere stand not moving
hands thrust in pockets

She turns back to the bench but the FIGURE in the SHINY GREEN
RAINCOAT is gone

She takes up a position at the far end of the platform She
waits

A moment later a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair A
few seconds later a train comes roaring into the station
Amy watches the car pass her one by one as the train slows
The train is virtually empty One car after the next rolls by
as the train slows

Finally as the train moves slowly to a stop a car different
from the others comes in This one for some odd reason

seems to have newspaper covering all the windows -- taped up
from the inside

One of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop directly

in front of the spot where Amy is standing -- the spot marked
by the stenciled PUZZLE BOX Theres a pause then the doors
slide open -- just one the one set in front of Amy The

others stay closed The interior of the car is dark -- the
lights apparently are not working

A tall ODD-LOOKING MAN in a CONDUCTORS UNIFORM is standing
there He gestures toward the adjoining car

ONDUCTOR
Next car

AMY
Is Joey on this ride

CONDUCTOR
Come on in

She enters The doors slide closed The train pulls out

INT SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

The interior of the car has been transformed into some odd-
ball cross between a very small nightclub and an crackhouse

As the train passes out of the station and the lights dim
we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes -- or at
any rate something being smoked in some kind of pipe
glinting in the darkness Various hands reach up and tug down
the newspapers and the tunnel lights come in providing a
flickering constantly changing illumination

In the uncertain light Amy can see the various CELEBRANTS

hanging out -- some on the seats some on the floor some
dressed some partially undressed some engaging in desultory
drug use others in desultory sex acts -- mostly teenagers

and twenty-nothings

Amy looks around not particularly effected by the oddness of
the scene The Conductor touches her arm

CONDUCTOR
Down that way

She threads her way through the tangle of people In the
flickering lights she catches glimpses of pale human flesh
PIERCED FACES PIERCED NIPPLES -- PIERCED THINGS that we
cant even be sure what they are

Expressions flash by in the flickering light some dull
others laughing

She pretty much ignores it all as she makes her way toward
the rear of the car A rat feeds on the contents of a young
womans purse as she and another woman are tangled in
passion

There illuminated in flashes JOEY a thin ill-shaven
English guy in his mid-twenties is sprawled on a seat One of
his lower eyelids has a ring in it It flicks up every time
he blinks He reads a newspaper while a woman bobs her head
up and down in his lap

Joey looks up and spots Amy He points an accusing finger at
her but his mood is good-natured

JOEY
Ahhhh now here comes a daring soul A
person committed to a just cause Another
seeker of the truth no doubt

Joey is clearly smitten with Amy

JOEY (CONTD)
I like what I see inside of you

AMY
Are you Joey

JOEY
Ive been called worse

He brushes the hair of the woman in his lap then offers Amy
his hand

JOEY
And I have the privilege of meeting

Amy looks at the woman in his lap declines a hand shake

AMY
Amy Klein Marla Chen sent me Im
looking for a girl named Katya Another
young girl with red hair and half her
head shaved A guy with glasses named
Winter

Joeys eyes narrow Something has clearly clicked He laughs
slightly starts shaking his head

JOEY
And the plot thickens Dont tell me
youre mixed up with those mother
fuckers Tell me Amy Klein do you even
know what theyre about

AMY
Thats why Im here I need you to help
me find them

JOEY
Oh jeez Moral quandary time here
What should he do what should he do If

he tells her -- the hopefully available
and eminently fuckable damsel is thrown
into the pit of oblivion -- or anyway is

potentially fucked up for life And that
would be such a regrettable waste If he

refrains from telling her she may yet
be saved A possible trophy awaits me
Angel and devil on the shoulder hmm

Angel devil angel devil Oh the hel
with it Entropys destroying everything
anyway Why shouldnt I do my part

A

MY
Tell me what you know about the Deaders

JOEY
You first What do you think they do

AMY
I think they bring the dead back to life

JOEY
Is that what you really think

AMY
Who are they Where can I find Winter

JOEY
Some people say Winters some sort of
fucked-up guru some say hes not human
and others say hes not real But there
is a place they hang out -- those who
believe I mean

AMY
Where is it

Joey hesitates A part of him clearly doesnt want to tell
AMY
Joey

JOEY
Angel devil angel devil

AMY
If you dont tell me someone here will

JOEY
Yeah you see now thats the problem
Youve got that fucked up self-
destructive thing going on

AMY
Im already into it

JOEY
Angel devil angel devil

Amy produces the Puzzle Box from her pack Joey looks at it
like hes just seen a ghost

JOEY
This is making me very unhappy

He pushes the woman from his lap Hes more serious now

JOEY (CONTD)
Poteilari and Minvara On the northeast
corner two doors down theres a
stairway going down into a closed up
building Its always locked and theyre
not always there I dont know where they
are when theyre not And once you get
mixed up with them -- its like that
story with the tar baby -- chances are
you never get loose and if you do you
never get clean

The Conductor shouts from somewhere

CONDUCTOR
Coming in

Hands promptly reach up covering the windows with newspaper
The Conductor goes to the door The band finishes its set as
the light from the station shines through the newspapers
Joey looking drab in the steady uneven light stares at Amy

JOEY
I cant take responsibility for you

AMY
Im not asking you to

Amy begins to walk off Joey leans forward for the first
time he seems sincere almost foreboding He shouts over the
breaking train

JOEY
Amy Klein Im doing a change of heart
thing here which doesnt usually happen
with strangers but Im trying to give a
little back its this whole Karma kick
Im on -- dont do it Dont go any
deeper Forget about it Move away
Change your name Become somebody
different

The other members of the car watch the two of them

AMY
Cant do that Ive got that fucked up
self- destructive thing going on

JOEY
Yes you do

The one door hisses open Amy stares at Joey for a second
turns and departs back into the fluorescent lit station

Joey calls after her
JOEY
Only he can bring you back
INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT
Amy stands on the platform as the door hisses shut The train

pulls away She checks her watch then moves to the other
side of the platform She looks down the tunnel The light
from an approaching train is beginning to reflect off the
curved wall of the tunnel

She turns back in the direction she just looked Far down the
platform theres a bench with a lone occupant - - a slumped
over figure dressed in a SHINY GREEN RAINCOAT She turns
toward it staring In the distance no details of face or
form are visible -- just the lumpy figure in the shiny green
raincoat She takes a step toward it but still cannot make
out any detail in the slumped over figure She approaches
as does the train There is no sign of movement

She comes around closer to the edge of the platform to get
a more direct view of the green-coated form As she does she
sees that one hand is draped off the front edge of the bench
hanging limp The hand is gray

Amy takes a step forward

His eyes pop open He looks at her with large black eyes
dead eyes Dripping from beneath his raincoat is a small pool
of fresh blood

Amy gasps takes a step back -- and her heel lands on the
edge of the subway platform She struggles for balance

Abruptly a mans voice comes from somewhere

VOICE
Amy Klein

Amy stumbles forward goes down to her knees and turns
Around twenty feet behind her standing on the edge of the
platform with his back toward the drop is-

- WINTER wearing a black trench-coat cinched at the waist
He looks down the tunnel Amy does as well The train is
coming into the station She turns back toward Winter He

stares at her with malevolent eyes

And as the train comes flying in he calmly falls backward
directly into its path

Amy screams
In an instant shes up running alongside the braking train
The doors open but virtually nobody comes out The front of
the train is still far ahead

AMY
Hey You hit someone Someone fell in
front of the train Hey Hey

The doors hiss and start to close Finally Amy reaches the
front window of the train She hammers on it It opens anda

middle-aged WOMANS face leans out -- the DRIVER
AMY
Somebody fell somebody fell in front

of the train

DRIVER
Where Where is he Whered he fall

AMY
Back there way back

She looks back in the direction from which shes come The
bench is now empty

T

DRIVER
Aw damn Dammit
Amy though is now looking this way and that -- at the

confused faces of people peeking out through the doors of the
train There is no sign of Winter

IME CUT

INT TRAIN STATION - LATER
The train is still there doors open There are TRANSIT COPS
on the station disgruntled passengers hanging out on the

platform TRACK WORKERS are poking around underneath it

Amy is leaning against one of the metal pillars staring at
the empty bench -- at the place where the mysterious figure
was sitting Shes looking grim

Behind her a Track Worker approaches the DRIVER whos
standing with a pair of Transit Cops Hes shaking his head
shrugging The Driver curses heads back toward the first
car One of the COPS approaches Amy

COP
Well the men have looked

AMY
And theres nothing there

COP
You dont seem terribly surprised

AMY
Hmm

Theres a sudden hiss Amy turns as the train doors close

COP
I mean you dont seem terribly surprised
that there isnt somebody under the
train A

MY
I dont know what to say I saw him

COP
Yeah Thats the thing Can you tell me
again just what it is that you saw

AMY
Um I was standing on the platform

The train starts to move out of the station Amy looks toward
it The train is moving on one of the center tracks so that
you can look through the windows of the cars and see through
them to the platform on the far side

AMY
and um I saw this man standing on
the edge of the platform facing away
from it

But now Amy is seeing something -- through the windows of the
moving train On the platform on the far side there is a
lone figure the man in the black trench-coat Amy jumps
looks more closely

COP
Did he say anyth

AMY
Its him

In an instant Amy is tearing down the platform heading for
the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side

COP
Hey

Amy is watching staring through the moving train windows
The figures are still there Winter is staring at her -

COP
Hey stop Tomislav Tomislav

n the next instant the Cop is giving chase and another
Cop clearly the Tomislav called by the first Cop further
down the station is rushing in to head Amy off

AMY
Its them Over there over there

n the next instant Tomislav tackles Amy and she goes down
on her face Even with the rather large Cop on top of her
shes still struggling

AMY
God damn it get off of me Get the hell
off of me Get

She keeps struggling as the first Cop and the others on the
station converge on her She looks toward the far platform

The figure is still there visible through the windows of the
departing train Then the last car of the train passes
leaving an unencumbered view of the far side
The platform is empty No sign of Winter No sign of anybody

Amy stop struggling as the Cops tug her arms back
handcuffing her She hardly notices but keep staring at the
empty platform across the tracks She glances up at the Cops

panting Tomislav looks down at her Then circles his finger
around his ear to his comrades They all understand

TOMISLAV (IN ROMANIAN)
Shes Crazy

INT POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Amy sits slouched in a chair looking particularly pale The
door opens behind her She hears a familiar voice

CHARLES (0S)
Is this where they keep the cheaper
whores

Amy glances up at him without expression

CHARLES
Christ youre lucky to have a boss like
me Once again I have saved your small
but relatively shapely behind

AMY
Least you got to travel What were they
going to charge me with anyway

CHARLES
Charge you They were thinking of
shipping you to the government asylum for
observation -- and believe me if you go
in there you dont come out But through
my mastery of international negotiations
I managed to convince them that you were
merely irresponsible You got your stuff

AMY
Yeah

CHARLES
Come on

Slowly feeling her bruises Amy gets up

EXT POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Charles and Amy walk and talk Its pissing down rain
Charles hold an umbrella for the two to share

AMY
Whyd you give me this story

CHARLES
Who else would have taken it Either
theyre going to think its bull-shit or
theyre going to be too afraid of it But

Amy Klein Tell me its real Amy
AMY

Its real -- or Im crazy
CHARLES

Well either way its a good story

AMY
Ive got leads Ill know in the end

CHARLES
You know Amy dearest for the average
person hunger for knowledge is like
hunger for food We want to know just
enough to take the edge off our appetite
Then were satisfied and we stop But
you youre like a glutton You cant
help over-eating

AMY
I dont see you complaining

CHARLES
But you see thats the point Thats why
I need you Because all that stuff I
dont eat I still want So I send you
in to do the eating for me and so I get
to experience it without actually
suffering any mental indigestion

AMY
Thats for me
CHARLES
Nobodys forcing anything down your
throat Correct

AMY
No

CHARLES
You see Amy you never grew up with all
this Catholic god and guilt stuff It
doesnt mean anything to you I worry
about god and heaven and hell Not during
the day you understand but around three
in the morning it keeps me up I want to
know whats coming Whats up in heaven
and down in hell or even if theres
nothing Its useful when youre making
plans So go find out and well tell the
world

AMY
You know Charles theres something
vaguely demonic about you

CHARLES
Did you know the word demon comes from
the Greek word for knowledge As in
demonstrate

AMY
No I didnt know that

Charles shakes his head disgusted

CHARLES
American education

Theyre in front of Amys Hotel now Charles flags down a
CAB

CHARLES
Then back to your room lie down in your
coffin until the hours of daylight have
passed as is your wont -- then go get me
my story A

MY
You dont have to worry

CHARLES
I never do Im not here to save people
and Im not here to judge them I just
take “em as they come And use them as
they pass by Ill be at the Soffitel

Charles hops in the cab and drives off as Amy walks up the
steps to the Hotel lobby Amy watches him go waves then
spins back towards the curb She flags down a cab and hops
in

EXT POTEILARI AND MINVARA - DAY

A ragged run-down place looking bleak and ugly in the
bright light of day We see the street sign identifying the

place -- Poteilari and Minvara A cab pulls up and Amy gets
out

She crosses the street passes one side door -- and then
comes to a building thats been sealed up -- doors and

windows cemented shut with cinder-blocks

Beyond a narrow railing is a stairway pressed up sideways
against the building running down to a basement entrance
Amy looks down the stairway to its narrow bottom The stairs
and the bottom are littered with trash A filthy mattress
lies at the very bottom Amy heads down

EXT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - DAY

At the bottom of the stairs theres a wooden door A hole
has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has
been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp thats been
bolted to the door frame Some official government notice of
some kind has been tacked to the door -- long rendered
unreadable by the effects of time

Amy inspects the padlock Its heavy and uncompromising She
tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain --
but thats only a few inches Amy peers into the darkness
beyond but cant see a thing
She looks down at the mattress that shes standing on steps
to the side and shoves it up

Then as if the light breaks she reaches out grabs the hasp
and pulls The bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose
They slide out with it She tugs the whole thing free and
pulls the door open

There is a narrow corridor beyond all in gloom Amy enters
INT THE CORRIDOR - DAY

Amy steps in her way illuminated only by the indefinite
light that leaks in from the street

Theres an archway presumably leading into the rest of the
basement on one side but its blocked by a great heap of
rubble

Amy ponders the chances of getting through it and decides to
check out the rest of the hallway She works her way through
a series of ominous corridors

Amy senses that she is not alone stops and turns around No
one She continues

There is only a single door left -- at the far end of the
hallway It hangs half-open but we cannot see whats inside
She approaches it reaches out and pushes the door open Its
a bathroom

As she enters we see a FIGURE beyond her in the hallways
buried in the shadows

INT THE BATHROOM - DAY

This is one of those nasty little makeshift places built into
an available corner -- basically a toilet and a sink so close
that theres hardly room to move A mop and some other
supplies long forgotten are propped up in a corner

Amy steps in looks down the toilet Nothing left but some
nasty stains -- the water long dried up Her face brushes
against something hanging in the air She pulls back Its a
pull string hanging from a naked light bulb
She tugs on it Nothing No power here

She stands in the dark claustrophobic place puzzled She
looks back down the hall It seems as if shes come to
another dead end Then she stares at the bathroom door Open
now it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall -- the only place
she hasnt looked

Amy steps back virtually straddling the toilet and pushes
the door closed As she does of course what little light
there is vanishes completely If theres something behind
the door she cant see it or anything else

Abruptly theres a sharp click as she lights her lighter
and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom -- and
the previously unseen space behind the door

The walls do not meet there There is a narrow gap leading
to a passage apparently between the walls perhaps ten
inches wide

Hesitating only a moment Amy turns sideways and slides
herself into the claustrophobic slot She holds the lighter
up ahead of her but its dim flickering light does not reach
to the end of the passage She moves forward cautiously --
the floor is littered with dried chunks of plaster rotting
insulation -- seventy-five years of stuff crumbled from the
insides of the walls

As she disappears into the tunnel the door slowly opens
behind her Passing across the rusty doorknob a menacing
blade appears

Inside the tunnel Amy reaches a vertical pipe up against one
side of the wall - - only a few inches thick but it reduces
the available room to under eight inches She hesitates
Meanwhile the lighter in her hand is getting hot She lets
it click off In some dim half-light we can see her slipping
a handkerchief carefully around it for insulation

She flicks the flint The lighter lights
And abruptly around a million roaches which had returned

from their hiding places in the absence of the light go
skittering every which way
Amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant

AMY
Christ

She looks at the pipe again and then starts to squeeze past
it Its a tight fit She has to squirm to get through

AMY
Welcome to club anorexia

She pops free and comes out the other side She holds up the
lighter Still the light cannot reach to the end of the
passage Steeling herself she moves on But as she does the
space seems to get progressively narrower and narrower

From ten inches to nine to eight until both sides of her
body are scraping against the walls She holds the lighter
out The wall continues to narrow

At the end of her outstretched arm the walls are only around
five inches apart

AMY
What the

Clearly shes reached the end of the line Annoyed she
starts to back out -- then realizes that the light on the far
side of her body renders the area into which shes now moving
essentially black as midnight

She brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her body
but she cant bring her hands together in front of her -- the
space is too narrow Finally she reaches her hand up over
her head passing the lighter from one hand to the other
directly over her head

As she does the lighter almost slips She grabs for it but
it goes out Again she is lost in virtual darkness

She strikes the flint It flickers but doesnt light As she
strikes it again IT LIGHTS SOMETHING IN THERE WITH HER Amy
doesnt see it we do
AND IT HAS A KNIFE IN ITS HANDS

The light returns -- now illuminating the other side of her
body -- the way from which shes come But because the space
is so narrow she cant turn her head towards the entrance
Once again the roaches go skittering away

And Amy starts heading back from where she entered Her
head facing away from her progress backward trying to
squeeze through

She holds up the lighter it lights the area ahead which
she cannot see The flickering fire exposes the figure
awaiting her

The walls on this side now also seem to narrow The space
revealed by the light is barely as wide as her fist and
there is only darkness beyond Darkness and the figure with
the knife Amy senses something is wrong

AMY
What the

She continues but now she can barely move a few feet before
the wall becomes too narrow to pass She pushes trying to
shove through the narrow gap But she cannot move The walls
have literally closed in until she is now squeezed between
them Panic sets in

Gasping Amy pushes against the wall shes facing Trying
desperately to turn her head around She forces with all her
might to turn her head her facial features stretching almost
comically She finally gets it around

She is face to face with the knife as it comes RIPPING
THROUGH FRAME narrowly missing her arm

Amy screams and drops the lighter Now in darkness she
scurries frantically away -- back deeper into the space

Amy starts struggling panic growing on her trying to climb
to crouch to tug free in some direction but her movement is
very limited The walls seem to close in on her
She is struggling to breathe against the pressing walls The
figure keeps advancing towards her

AMY
Stop Please stop Stop this

Shes flailing her arms now frantic The knife-wielding
figure struggles having difficulty as well One of Amys
hands flies back and hits the wall behind her

Now she really panics her hands desperately scraping along
the wall looking for anyway out There isnt any

She looks back toward her attacker whos now right on top
of her and raising the knife for one final blow

Amy braces for the blades impact as she pushes against the
wall when suddenly she-

Falls backward onto the floor Her heart pounding Her
breathing heavy

She checks her arms for wounds There arent any
She looks up The Figure is gone

She stands confused and finds herself in an empty room
Some discarded junk a pile of loose plaster She leaps
forward and nearly trips on a piece of rubble to get the
hell away from the entry Odd thing ishere is no entry
She whips herself around towards the sound of someone sharply
e

She looks this way and that but cant see the source of the
sound The attacker

A pale light is visible coming from around a far corner

Someone steps into the light A young BLACK KID He holds a
finger up to his lips

BLACK KID
Shhhh follow me

He signals her to follow him Amy moves cautiously forward
AN ADJOINING ROOM

he walls have been partially torn down The light comes from
n adjoining room Amy approaches cautiously remaining in

he shadows and leans forward staring through a gap in the
all into the room beyond

Z2atouH

he various participants some of whom we recognize from the
ideotape movie are standing crowded around something on the
loor Amy cant see just what it is that theyre staring at
t first but she does see that one of the ones gathered

here is Katya complete with the hole in her head She
ervously puts a a finger into the hole and inspects the
lood

opt eamhaH

The sound of the exhalations is coming from the unseen place

Then somebody in the circle moves to get a better vantage
point and now Amy can see clearly what is going on

Winter is lying on top of the corpse of a YOUNG MAN
breathing into his mouth as he did with Katya An almost
sexual encounter yields the same results as the tape

He takes a final deep breath And then as before the Young
Man gasps Winter pulls away As he does we can see the
Young Mans face smiling despite the knife that is lodged
into his chest Winters grabs the knife and yanks it out

The others come forward helping him up

Winter stands and somebody slips a robe over his body He
promptly looks straight at Amy still hidden in the shadows

WINTER
I have a room of my own Kindly join me

He throws the knife at the wall where it embeds itself in
way further then it should have and walks away Amy moves
away from the opening She circles around through a doorway
and into the space that she was previously watching

She moves forward hesitantly trying to avoid the touch of
the various occupants who dont behave aggressively but
clearly press forward into her personal space

She looks this way and that trying to find where Winter has
gone

A hand comes down on her shoulder She turns suddenly Its
the Black Kid He gestures

BLACK KID
Winters through there

He points toward a doorway lost in shadow Amy notices on
his pointing hand that his wrists have been deeply slashed
She looks down to the other hand which the kid politely
offers for her to examine

Amy backs away through the crowd Following her is the
recently revived Young Man whos still completely naked
He smiles at Amy She moves away and through the door to
Winters room

INT WINTERS ROOM - DAY

This is a small dark space light coming mostly froma
rather conventional-looking standing lamp In the shadows
beyond the little space of light is a confusion of half-open
doors walls and shadows half lit rooms with un-guessable
occupants

Winter is there sitting in a padded chair in front of a
coffee table reading a book Amy steps inside Winter
doesnt react to her presence Abruptly the door closes
behind her She hesitates and walks forward

WINTER
Amy Klein
AMY
You know me
WINTER

I chose you

Amy pauses unsure then moves forward and takes a seat
opposite him

AMY
That was a hell of a way in Makes me
think that you dont want
WINTER
People come in here the way they want If
it was difficult then that was the way
you wanted it A little danger A little
mystery Thats what you expected Thats
what you found

Winters puts the book down His attention is now on Amy

WINTER (CONTD)
Were you afraid Amy Just now And
during your little rite of passage
through the walls

AMY
Yes Was it real

Winter smiles he displays amusement to Amys suspicions

WINTER
And were you afraid when you saw Marla
Chen Of what you found in the bathroom

AMY
Yes

WINTER
You took something from her

Winter studies Amy

WINTER (CONTD)
Do you have it with you

Amy opens her bag and produces the Puzzle Box She lays on
the table between them

AMY
What is it

WINTER
My great grandfather created that box
He left it as agift A way to cheat
death an entrance to everlasting
pleasures and it belongs to me Though
there are others who would disagree

AMY
Marla warned me about it about you

WINTER
Really Should I be honored or afraid
that you are here Amy Klein Do you
really think you can just go along with
us for a little ride and then get off
when it suits you Like your new friends
on the train Youre not going to find it
so easy to get off this train

AMY
So I shouldnt get on

WINTER
Your already on it Dont dance with me
Amy Klein Dont think for a second that
you arent in danger You are in more
danger than ever imagined possible

AMY
What the hell does that mean

Winter leans into Amys space

INTER
Listen to me There are things that are
true in the light of day There are other
things that are no less true that live
in the shadows When you shine a light on
them they disappear They stop being
true Thats because it is the
uncertainty of the dark that makes them
possible If the dark is deep enough
anything might be happening in it
Anything at all Im one of those things

AMY
What happened to Marla Chen What did you
do to her
He stands and walks away from Amy

INTER
Marla Why I accepted her thats all
Thats all Ive ever done for the people
who come to me

AMY

She didnt want to become one of you
whatever the hell you are Thats why she
killed herself

WINTER
Oh but she did And what makes you so
sure shes dead

Winters studies Amy face

INTER (CONTD)
We all die over and over and over again
Marla cant commit suicide All she can
do is stop believing that shes alive
And she cant even do that

(MORE)

WINTER (contd)
The more she doubts the deader she
becomes But shell never really die
because shes not really alive

AMY
That doesnt mean anything What I saw in
that room was real What I smelled was
real Real like this table

She raps on the table with her middle finger palm up She
then lifts her hand up keeping her middle finger towards
Winter

AMY
Real like like this hand

In a flash almost supernaturally Winter passes seemingly
through the chair and is front of Amy her hand held tightly
by his He reaches up with his other hand and uncurls Amys
fingers
WINTER
You say this is real

He begins to move his fingers over her hand enumerating the
various parts

WINTER
Epidermis The dorsal fascia Transverse
carpal ligament across here

The process is taking on an oddly seductive quality

WINTER
The median nerve underneath it Down
here the carpal bones And do you

think that all those parts are what makes
a hand Ill show you what makes a
hand here

He begins to move his fingers through the spaces in between
her fingers Amy is frozen still

Amy finds herself responding falling under his spell

FLASH CUT TO

INT DEADERS DUNGEON - DAY

Amy awakens from the trance She is lying down surrounded by
the Deaders Winters stands above her

WINTER
What did you see

AMY
Nothing
INTER
What are you afraid of Amy

AMY
Im not afraid of you

WINTER

Yes you are but still you cant run --

(studies her)
I wonder why that is

(beat)
Im no devil Im no monster Amy Ill
never hurt you and Ill never leave you

Amy doesnt answer Winter extends to her a knife
WINTER (contd)
Accept my gift No more fear No more
questions No one can ever hurt you

again

For a moment she appears to consider his offering Then as

if waking up she shoves herself back away from Winter
AMY
No get get away

But now the Dead are there surrounding her reaching out for
her They begin to chant

Winter takes the PUZZLE BOX and places on a makeshift altar
at the head of the mattress

DEADERS
(reciting)
My skin isnt real My eyes arent real
My muscles arent real My bones my
heart my veins and nerves and flesh and
meat arent real-

WINTER

Lie down Amy Itll only hurt for a
second I promise
AMY
Youre crazy

DEADERS
- What I see what I hear what I taste
what I touch what I remember what I
think what I feel arent real

WINTER
No more pain Only pleasure

The Deaders start to grab onto her She starts to panic a
little

AMY (contd)
No

She fights her way from the group and

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

Amy SMASHES THROUGH a vertical plane of safety glass
smashing it into a thousand tiny fragments as she goes
crashing back through it

Her head hits hard against a tile wall and she goes sliding
down in the dark her hand scrambling for something to hold
onto

Her reaching hand grabs some metal handle She pulls and
abruptly water begins to cascade down onto her face

She turns herself sideways and rolls over gasping Shes in
a bathtub in fact shes just been thrown through the
safety-glass door She scrambles over the bottom edge of the
sliding glass door scraping herself across the tiny pegs of
glass that still line the border of the frame

She pulls herself up her hand feeling for a light switch
Finally she finds it flips the switch

Shes in the hotel bathroom slumped over against the sink

Soaking wet scratched shaking gasping she stares at
herself in the mirror

Theres a tiny square of glass stuck into her shoulder She
tugs it loose It clinks as she drops it into the sink

AMY
Its not real its not real
She lifts her hand to wipe the wet hair from her face then

pauses She turns toward the bathtub She reaches through the
shattered door and turns off the shower

INT AMYS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
THE PHONE RINGS She snatches it out of its cradle

AMY
Hello

CHARLES
(through phone)
Amy its Charles I know its not too
late

AMY
You just cant go too long without
hearing my voice

CHARLES
Guilty Look Amy Ive been thinking
about the story about what happened

Amy grabs the PUZZLE BOX off the table She spins it in her
hands

AMY
Charles you know I value your opinion-

CHARLES
- she said with condescension-

AMY
- but if there was ever a story I was
born to write this is it

CHARLES
I think its too dangerous for a lot of
reasons
AMY
This isnt like you

CHARLES
I know Im going to hate myself in the
morning
AMY

Thats all Its just a funk but Im
fine All I need is some sleep

CHARLES

(beat)

Hey Charles did you know that the word
demon comes from the Greek word for

knowledge

CHARLES
Yes I believe Ive heard that somewhere
before

AMY
Well I wish somebody had told me about
it

She hangs up and shuts off a light on her way to bed

FLASHBACK

INT HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

CLOSE ON the LITTLE GIRL slung under THE MANS arm as he
carried her down the hall Shes scraping at the walls the
door jams anything to try to free herself from him

Her hand sweeps across a small table at the end of the hall
smashing over a GLASS VASE
SMASH CUT TO

INT AMYS HOTEL ROOM - LATER

The room is dark drained of all color the way things appear
when we see in them in almost total darkness

Amys lying in bed on her stomach The sheet has crumpled off
of her Shes dressed only in her panties

Abruptly theres the sound of a wettish thud and Amy seems
to bounce a little Her eyes open but she isnt alarmed
Still lying on her back she flicks her eyes this way and
that but seeing nothing she closes them again

A few seconds later we see some black liquid trickle across
her shoulder coming from the unseen center of her back It
follows a course down her backbone then swerves and finds a
path along the inner edge of one of her shoulder blades
finally trickling down her neck It continues to flow
staining the pillow by her face

She stirs slightly clearly feeling the trickle She puts her
hand to her shoulder smearing the black liquid Still half-

asleep she tries to brush it off but it continues to
flow Finally her eyes open She sits up painfully and looks
at her hands -- stained with this sticky black stuff She

stares at it not quite awake enough to figure it out

She reaches over her shoulder pulls her hand back stained
with the black stuff She looks down at her pillow also
stained Confused she rises painfully awkward and heads
toward the bathroom We can see that her feet leave blackish
wet footprints across the floor as she moves toward the
bathroom

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

She moves in stares in the mirror -- sees the side of her
face and her shoulder smeared with black She fumbles for
the light flips it on

In the sudden shocking glare of returning light COLOR
abruptly re-enters the world And the black of the liquid
thats stained Amys face and hands that track the floor of
the white-tiled bathroom that smear the wall where she
flipped on the light switch turns instantly to its true color

The color of blood

Amy gasps at the sight -- she looks like shes just crawled
out of a slaughterhouse She reaches behind her feeling her
back trying to find the source of the blood that seems to be
pouring out of her dripping to the floor pouring down the
small of her back staining the back of her panties a vivid
ghastly red

In a sudden impulse she turns on the water in the sink full
blast washes away the blood from her hands scooping
handfuls onto her face and the front of her body The water
drips to the floor commingling with the blood turning it a
nasty pink

She reaches behind her back feeling again -- her hand comes
back as vividly red as before Again she washes them She
stops dead seeing something in the mirror

Something is glinting between her breasts She touches her
finger to it It looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal
poking out from inside of her almost like a tiny steel
splinter It appears to have just barely broken through the
skin from inside -- barely a drop of blood

She stands staring down at it breathing fast What the hell
is it

Then slowly almost against her will she turns her back to
the mirror and looks over her shoulder She sees -- and we
see for the first time -- the center of her back where her
questing hands couldnt reach

There is a knife there literally thrust through the middle
of her back The gleaming splinter between her breasts is the
tip of the knife that has literally transfixed her -- and
clearly transfixed the center of her chest -- her heart

She strains her hands back trying to reach this impossible
thing but her grasping fingers cant touch it She turns
back toward the mirror staring into her own eyes

AMY
Its not real its not real

She clenches her eyes opens them Her fingers feel
desperately for the metal tip between her breasts Its still
there

AMY
Wake up wake up wake up

She starts slapping her hands against the side of her face --
not gently hard slaps But she isnt waking up She grabs
her hair pulls hard Nothing Shes still there The knife
is still stuck impossibly in her back

She sits on the closed seat of the toilet not knowing what
to do She reaches again for the knife but she cant touch
it She buries her face in her bloody hands

AMY
Im dreaming Im dreaming
(screams)

IM DREAMING

She stands turns this way and that not knowing what to do
She looks around her bathroom searching for something She
tugs open the medicine cabinet searches beneath the sink
tugging the various stuff out Whatever it is that shes
looking for she cant find it

She spins back to the mirror Opens it Slips back against it
wedging the knife handle between the door and the medicine
cabinet

Holding one hand against the mirror she starts to push away
wincing in pain

We can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish
from view drawn back inside her body Slowly making a
wet sticky sound the long thin knife begins to slide out

With a gasp she heaves out and the knife goes flying It
bounces on the floor splattering blood With shaking hands
Amy bends over and picks it up She stands staring at it
Its some kind of nasty stiletto Amy stands staring at it

A FLASHBACK

Amy searching Marlas drawers tugging one open -- pressing
the stud on a stiletto ON THIS STILETTO

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

She looks down toward the floor She is literally standing in
a pool of her own blood She gasps turns back toward the
mirror

Blood is pouring from the wound Gasping almost crying Amy
stumbles back into the main room With shaky hands she picks
up the phone then realizes that shes still holding the
stiletto in her hand She drops it on the table Her bloody
fingers press in the numbers -- 9-9-9 (emergency)

She waits standing in the middle of her dark hotel room
shaking bloody She can hear the phone ring and ring

Finally theres a click as the line picks up But theres no
voice on the other end

AMY
Hello hello Hello Is there anyb

Then she stops dead There is somebody there and making a
sound weve heard before The nasty gurgling that Amy heard
when she tried calling Marlas room

MARLA
(through phone)
Only he can bring you back

She slams the phone down tears the cord from the wall As
she turns to fling it she hears the sound of a man speaking

She turns at the sound

PINHEAD is standing across the room from her reading from
one of the books on a tiny bookshelf in the corner

PINHEAD
(reading)
--to all of us - there comes the closing

of the doors - the entrances - the exits -
so that one may pass no more out or
in

He closes the book turns toward her

PINHEAD
Walt Whitman I like your taste in books

AMY
Came with the room Along with the
uncomfortable couch

Amy puts the phone back on the table

AMY
Who are you Why did you do this to me

PINHEAD
I didnt Believe me when I want to hurt
you it will be more than a scratch

AMY
Then why the hell are you here Why are
you in my room

PINHEAD
This isnt your room Its mine

AMY

What

PINHEAD
This is my room my building my
street my world You still cant
believe that youre in the real world
can you I mean youve just had a

A knife run through you Shouldnt it hurt

AMY
Its a dream Im dreaming

PINHEAD
No Dreams come to an end Nightmares are
forever

He approaches her She backs away
PINHEAD
Youve been recruited as a soldier in
another mans war A war he will never
win that I can assure you

AMY
I dont know what youre talking about

PINHEAD
You will Soon enough But one shouldnt
worship false Gods Especially when that
false God is themselves

AMY
Im not a believer

PINHEAD

Oh you will Tell me do you believe in
Hell

Looks down at the blade jutting out from her chest

AMY
Starting to

PINHEAD
You opened a door He pulled you in But
the only way out -- is through me

He steps towards her
She grabs up the phone flings it It hits the far wall and

falls to the floor Winters gone She reaches a hand behind
her to her back brings it back red with blood

A MOMENT LATER

We see Amy rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder Hands
trembling she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that
shes unwound from a roll and laid down on the table sticky
side up

She presses the towel down so that it sticks then picks up
the tape with towel attached She slides the towel down the
center of her back until it covers the wound and then tugs
the tape tight across her chest compressing the towel
against the wound

She takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel
and herself a couple more times finally biting through the
tape and tossing the roll away She yanks yesterdays clothes
up discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans

She tugs them up over her bloody legs pulls a black shirt on
over her top thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy
shoes and finally tugs on a black leather jacket

She goes to the mirror turns trying to see how her profile
looks with the towel stuffed in her back

She turns about to leave then realizes that her hands are
red with her own blood She hurries to the sink rinses them
off and rinses the blood off of her face and neck then
grabs her bag and heads out the door

EXT AMYS HOTEL - NIGHT

Amy comes unsteadily down out of her Hotel

EXT DARK STREET - NIGHT
More shadows than light

She comes around a corner and onto a narrow street moving
fast her feet making loud echoey clip-clops on the street

Theres a bum dressed in rags leaning up against the wall
of a building

As she approaches him he stirs slightly Then she looks more
closely

The man is eating something very crunchy He stares at her

blankly as he picks crickets off the wall and devours them
one by one He offers her one and smiles

Amy leaps back turns and runs Some distance down the
street there seems to be a flicker of light a trace of
noise

She scrambles toward it Its coming up from a subway grate
She throws herself down on it

Down below she can hear the roar of a subway train passing
below Indirect flickering light shines up from below

She looks up Theres a subway entrance She hurries toward
it

INT TOKEN BOOTH - NIGHT

Amy comes down the stairs No sign of life The fluorescent
lights flicker - some dead Amy fumbles for her metro card
This is one of those unattended entrances with entry through
the top-to-bottom turnstiles

She starts through the turnstile Then with a squeak it
sticks and she finds herself stuck half-way through unable
to move forward or backward She tries to back out but the
thing wont turn in that direction She heaves forward It
finally gives way She looks this way and that back through
the turnstile she sees her bloody footprints leading all the
way through

Amy hears footsteps echoing towards her Through a large
mirror at an intersection she sees the source of the
footsteps A cop on the beat

Amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her own
blood The footsteps get louder

She sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand She
grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover the
blood It soaks threw in no time The Cop is nearing the
corner She grabs another then another and throws them
down The pool of her blood leaks from under them all The
cop rounds the corner he has a baton he taps against his
leg

Amy grabs the whole stand and tips it over With a loud
SMASH it spills the newspaper everywhere As the cop walks
in front of Amy the blood is hidden beneath the pile of
newspapers Amy bends down to attend to the mess

She makes eyes with the Cop and shrugs her shoulders at her
mistake The Cop smiles and nods and keeps on walking

The sound of his footsteps vanish down the corridors

Amy collects herself with a few deep breaths and moves on
towards the platform

INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT

Amy stands on the platform as a train whooshes into the
station at HYPER-SPEED then stops instantly in front of her

The doors hiss open and Amy is greeted by the tall Odd-
looking Conductor She pushes past him

INT TRAIN - NIGHT

The train lurches forward as Amy makes her way through the
usual crowd of CELEBRANTS

She finds Joey sitting court in the middle of the train car
Hes wearing a pair of terminator sunglasses

Amy approaches His face seems sickly pale in the flashing
light

He moves abruptly a slight turn of the head -- toward her

JOEY
Well look whos back What now

AMY
I need please please help me

JOEY
Help you with what

Amy hesitates an instant then tugs open her shirt revealing
the gaffers tape that holds the rolled-up towel to her back
She works at it Finally it tears She tears it straight
down the front of her chest as Joey watches passive

Her chest is stained with blood She licks her fingers and
wipes the blood away from the middle of her chest Joeys
eyes narrow He leans forward to study it He leans in
closer hesitates then leans back looking Amy in the eye

JOEY
Wow are those real

Amy doesnt react

JOEY
Okay youre not in the mood for my light-
hearted banter What the hell this isnt
my idea of paradise either

AMY
dont understand Why arent I dead Or
am I Please

JOEY

Life death theyre not all that
different really You can find your
death in your life You can find your
life in your death Round and round and
round you go

AMY
Please help me

JOEY

AMY

Then explain what the hell is going on
Why did I have a knife buried in my back
Why am I seeing dead people walking
around Why is there a guy with Pins in
his head stopping by in the middle of the
night for a chat

She gets in his face

AMY
Why am I not DEAD

Theres a jolt as the train starts to pull into the station
The light from the station begins to illuminate the inside of
the car more clearly Joey leans back from her
JOEY
Whoa Its time to give in Amy youre
just fighting it too hard Forget about
the truth forget about reality just sit
back and enjoy the ride Theres nothing
you can do anyway Were all just pieces
in Winters little puzzle

AMY
The box

JOEY
Youre willing to do anything to find the
truth

(MORE)

JOEY (contd)
Thats what I find most attractive about
you Well that and the fact that you
have a great ass You and I are the same
really were both willing to take it as
far as it will go to the edge to the
extreme

(beat)

You know what our biggest problem is Amy
Klein Neither of us know when to get off
the God damn train

The train jerks to a stop tossing Amy a little She regains
her footage and turns back to Joey but in the flickering
fluorescent light Joeys skin suddenly looks sickly pale

AMY
Joey

He doesnt answer He doesnt move

AMY
Joey come on Lets get off the train
Right now you and me

He still doesnt move Amy reaches out a shaky hand and takes
his glasses off
AMY
(voice trailing off)
You and me

Joeys eyes are empty glazed Hes dead Not only is he
dead its clear that hes been dead for awhile

Then she freezes when she realizes the sound has completely
dropped out around her

All she can hear is her heart beating

She slowly turns around to find that all of Joeys Celebrants
on the train are also dead and surrounded by the familiar
buzz of flies

Some of the dead are hung from the hand rails by HOOKS AND
CHAINS their throats slashed eyes gouged bullet holes in
the head etc

A large female cenobite is sewing the filleted skin from one
Deaders throat open to reveal his vocal chords He makes a
sound at Amy and his chords vibrate

But theres this one COKE HEAD GUY who was snorting a line
when Amy got on the train

He looks normal as he snorts up the last rail off his hand-
held mirror

She studies him for a moment when suddenly he turns to her
and we get a good look at his FACE

The entire left side of his face has rotted away and we can
see the powdery coke lining his decaying left nostril

COKE-HEAD GUY
Looks like the partys over

Suddenly all she can her is the LOUD ROAR OF THE TRAIN

Amy stumbles back turns to run into the next train car and
smacks right into-

MARLA CHEN A horribly decaying Marla Chen

At first Amy is confused but then something clicks behind her
eyes as she shoves Marla back down the train car
AMY
(screams)
Why did you do this to me

The trains screeches into the station and the doors HISS
OPEN

MARLA
We have to go

AMY
(louder)
Why

MARLA
I didnt have any other choice

Amy looks down at her shirt as BLOOD begins to soak through
it

AMY
Whats happening to me

MARLA
Youre dying
(beat)
Like me

Marla grabs her hand and starts to pull her along

MARLA
Please Weve got to go

AMY
Where

MARLA
Thats for you to decide

Amy looks around the platform as if deciding what to do
Theres a little panic in Marlas voice

MARLA
You see thats the problem right there
Im supposed to help you Like Like

Winter helped me But I dont know if I
can
AMY
Then why are you here

MARLA
To try Because I have no other choice
No turning back now-
(rehow she looks)
Know what I mean

AMY
No I dont I dont know one God damn
thing anymore
(beat)
I just want to go home

Marla gives her a comforting smile

MARLA
Then lets go home

They jump down to an abandoned track and head into the
darkness
INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

A strange twisting tunnel with eerie blue lights Pipes
running along the ceiling dripping water and hissing steam

Amy and Marla march quickly towards camera

AMY
Marla what what happened to you

MARLA
I put my head through a noose and I
jumped ten feet down They cut me down
and Winter breathed into me and I was
alive And everybody was happy and
like congratulating me

Marlas eyes are wet with yellowish tears

MARLA
And for a while it was great But its
like being a tightrope walker youre
walking along on this rope and then all
of a sudden its like you realize -- Im
walking on a rope a hundred feet up in
the air And thats when you fall
(

struggles to control herself)
I tried to end it Thats when you found
me

AMY

Why are you doing this Why am I here

MARLA
For the reward from it all

The tunnel starts to take some weird twists and turns

They stop and Marla turns amy in her direction The place
starts to tremble a train is approaching from far off

MARLA
But it isnt enough for somebody else to
stick a knife into you You have to come
to the point where you can do it to
yourself -- thats the acceptance The
final preparation before you give your
soul to it Willingly

AMY
But why What it is all for

MARLA

Thats the missing link That part he
keeps to himself But he promises an
eternal paradise filled with the ultimate
pleasures We just cant be afraid And
we cant have any doubts

(introspective)
Guess I screwed up on that part

The tunnel is narrowing the train is right around the bend
Amy turns to the sound of the rumbling train

MARLA
Fear is where you go to learn
Amy spins back to her Huh

MARLA
Sorry I told you theres no turning back
Amy Only he can bring you back

Amys attention is on the train it roars in at full
throttle

WINTER
Amy

Amy turns around just as the train is about to run through
them to find WINTER arms open for her

WINTER
(screaming over the train)
All roads lead home

INT A BED - DAY

Amys eyes abruptly pop open

Shes lying on a white pillow with white sheets tucked up
over her She turns her eyes to one side Theres a hospital

curtain the kind on a railing pulled closed around her She
looks down

Shes lying in a hospital bed She tries to move but she
realizes her hands and legs are tied to the bed by large
leather straps Charles is there in a chair watching her

CHARLES
Good morning

He takes a sip of coffee She struggles with the straps
CHARLES
Amy dont fight it its only going to
make things worse

Her eyes dart around the room in a panic

AMY
What the hell happened

CHARLES
I didnt hear from you I went over to
your hotel You were lying on the
floor covered in every kind of stuff
that can come out of a human body

She remembers

AMY
The blood

Amy looks down at her gown expecting a large red stain but
theres no blood

CHARLES
Okay Every other kind

AMY
I dont I mean I didnt
CHARLES
You were sort of having a psychotic

episode sweets Major mental blow-out
And frankly its about time Jesus you
were tied down for a day and half

(off her look)
Listen Im trying to get you out of
here back to London but with the damage
to your hotel room Theyre not going
to be so quick to let you go

Amy takes a look around the psych ward PATIENTS walking
aimlessly mumbling to themselves arguing with unseen
opponents rocking back and forth in catatonic states

CHARLES
Look Amy you probably wont have to
stay

Amy feels a sudden rush of relief A little nervous laughter

AMY
Hey Charles Charles this is the best
news Ive had in a long time

CHARLES
Well there you go A whole new
definition of optimism

AMY
What about Marla Chen The story

CHARLES
They found her dead in her room She hung
herself

AMY
They found her You mean the police

CHARLES
Yeah Shed been there awhile Probably
did it right after she sent us the tape

AMY
Where is she

CHARLES
Jesus I dont know Does it matter

AMY
No I guess not

CHARLES
But this is a good story too Call it
My Psychotic Episode -- or wait maybe

Psychotic - Episode One Or Psychotic
Pilot Episode You know some play on
words with episode

(looks around)
Look theres a lot of raw material
around here Emphasis on the word raw
Maybe theyll let you use a felt-tip pen
or something to take notes

Somebody pulls the curtain aside Its an ORDERLY His name
tag identifies him as M KIRCHER This guys a little out
like maybe hes been dipping into the medicine cabinet
a little too much His eyes nervously scan the room like
somebodys watching him

KIRCHER
Well look whos back How we feelin

She motions to the straps

AMY
Trapped

KIRCHER
Sorry Theyre for your own protection
The way you were flailing around when
they brought you in -- somebody was bound
to get hurt

(he chuckles to himself)
Get it BOUND to get hurt

Amy doesnt laugh Doesnt even crack a smile

AMY
Dont quit your day job

CHARLES
(to Kircher)
Whats say we lose the charm bracelets
for now
(turns to Amy)
Unless of course you somehow find all of
this -- stimulating

AMY
Dont drag me into your fantasies
Charles
(to Kircher)
Please

Kircher obliges and scribbles something on a folder at the
end of the bed Charles leans over gives her a little peck
on the cheek As he does he whispers to her

CHARLES
(whispering)
Ill see about getting a camera in
here

He stands winks at her

CHARLES
Feel better
(beat)
When you get a chance check out the
public area Its a swinging place I
mean like theyre literally
swinging

He heads out Amy watches him go She waits a beat and then
hops out of bed She looks around for Nurses and Orderlies
but theres no one around She exits frame
INT PSYCH WARDCOMMON AREA - DAY

Blank walls lit with flickering fluorescent lighting Theres
a TV hanging from ceiling in the corner showing TIME-LAPSE
PHOTOGRAPHY of a blooming rose (a little homage to the
original Hellraiser)

We move to find a various assortment of PATIENTS but none of
them are watching the TV theyre too busy entertaining
themselves and their invisible friends

Amy enters cautiously feeling a little threatened by the
other patients She looks around not sure where she should
plant herself and then she sees her-

A LITTLE GIRL (age 6) sitting off by herself in the corner of
the room drawing pictures A few of them (a half humanhalf
monster clawing at a closet door a child screaming a child
running from the monster a child holding a butcher knife
etc) are taped on the wall behind her

Amy walks over to her Theres just something about her

AMY
Mind if I join you

LITTLE GIRL
Please Im drawing pictures

AMY
I can see that theyre lovely

LITTLE GIRL
Want me to draw your picture

AMY
Id like that very much

The Little Girl stares at Amy and focuses in on her features
We cant see what shes drawing as her little hand starts to
move across the sketch pad

But theres something a little off Her hand doesnt move
like a six-year-old would draw it moves with the confidence
and control of an adults
Amy tries to get a glance at the portrait The Little Girl
pulls it close to her

LITTLE GIRL
No peaking

AMY
Im sorry youre right

With a few more strokes the drawing is complete The Little
girl studies it pleased with herself

She spins it so Amy -- but not the audience -- can see it
CLOSE ON AMY -- her eyes wide with terror

LITTLE GIRL
What do you think

AMYS POV as we get our first good look at it

Its Amys face as a CENOBITE twisted and stretched in a way
that begins to reveal the skull around her DARK EMPTY EYES

Theres also that nasty knife wound in the center of her
chest with hooks stretching the skin back and to the side

LITTLE GIRL (0C)
I only draw what I see Amy

Amy backs away from her trembling

AMY
How do you know my name

The Little Girl giggles Amy turns to the other drawings that
the Little Girl has taped to the walls
T

hey too now all look like Cenobites some look like Deaders
one looks just like WINTER

AMY
No this isnt happening

Amy gets up to run but then she freezes when she sees-

MARLA sitting on the opposite side of the room But heres
the thing She looks fine
Amy walks over hesitant confused

AMY
Marla

Marla doesnt seem to recognize her
AMY (CONTD)
Marla Youre alive

MARLA
You say that like its a good thing

Marla takes a long quiet look around the room and then leans
in close unable to keep up her charade

MARLA
(whispers)
You know hes watching us

AMY
Who

MARLA
Winter This is where he sends all the
trouble makers Tries to show us whos
boss Tries to make us believe

AMY
So it is real

MARLA
As real as you want it to be We all have
our own version of the truth some are
just more screwed up than others But you
wouldnt know that because you still
dont know the truth

AMY
I dont understand

MARLA
You will You see thats the point All
this Deaders Cenobites whatever

you want to call it its all about
solving the puzzle Part of that puzzle
is you Finding the secrets that are
hidden within you

Marla pokes a finger at Amys heart Right on her wound

MARLA
- in there And as soon as you find that
as soon as you face it youll be free
Once and for all

he pulls back into her chair

MARLA (CONTD)
Me -- Im still looking
A
MY
But what is it all for

MARLA
Ultimate pleasure -- more than anyone
even those who have solved the puzzle
before us have ever known Conditions of
the nerve endings the likes of which your
imagination could not hope to evoke
Marla stares at Amy deeply The breaks into a smile

MARLA
-at Least thats what they say

Marla looks around the room to see if anyone is watching her
and then she takes Amys hand and leans in close

MARLA
Problem is Winter cant solve the puzzle
Only a few chosen ones -- with just the
right amount of depravity and loneliness
in their soul -- can

beat)
So hes been on this quest for years
searching for that mythical person who is
both willing to join us and can also
solve the puzzle And it would seem Amy
Klein that that person is-

AMY
Me

MARLA
Bingo baby Sorry

Shes trying to give Amy a clue without tipping off anyone
who might be watching her

MARLA
He has to be there for you Amy And he
will be Like he was for all of us
Thats the key Without him you cant
come back Its you he wants Its you he
needs Remember that above all

Marla looks down at Amys chest Amy follows her stare to
find blood starting to soak through her hospital gown Amys

eyes begin to glaze over

MARLA
Looks like youre running out of time

Amy leaps up from the table and suddenly Marla is gone In
fact the whole room is empty and dead quiet A pool of blood
lies beneath her seat She staggers a bit as she moves
forward

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

The main corridor It seems to go on forever

Amy turns back to the common area Empty

The she hears the familiar sound of A LITTLE GIRL SCREAMING
Its faint and echoing

Amy turns back down the corridor to the Little Girls voice
MARLA (VO)
Its all about finding the truth

Amy starts to slowly make her way down the long cold
corridor

With each step she takes the walls of the corridor become
whiter slowly bleaching out She looks below her and sees

the blood now draining from the wound

She stumbles back slowly and turns as the LITTLE GIRLS
SCREAMS continue

Then she hears the BANGING and RATTLING of a door Like
someones fighting to get out

FLASHBACK

INT HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)
AMYS FATHER half walking half stumbling out of one of the
rooms at the far end of the corridor Hes dressed in a

stained white tank top shirt his eyes glazed and distant

Hes knows the source of the noise -- and hes pissed

INT CORRIDOR - DAY
Back to scene
Amy keeps stumbling down the corridor

FLASHBACK

INT HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Now Amy is within the flashback She looks good no blood
almost peaceful Her father looks down the corridor toward
Amy but doesnt seem to see her He turns and storms off in
the opposite direction

Amy cant believe what shes seeing but she cant help
herself She follows him

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Back to scene

Amy is stumbling more than walking as she grows weaker with
every step Her eyes begin to glaze over and her vision is
beginning to blur

She looks down to find the trail of BRIGHT RED BLOOD trailing
behind her on the otherwise PURE-WHITE floor

When she looks back up she finds herself in-

FLASHBACK

INT HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The hallway from Amys childhood home Her Father is now only
a few steps in front of Amy as he reaches the door to his
office

He turns into it and we follow Amy as she steps into the
office behind him to find-

INT FATHERS OFFICE - DAY

The CLOSET DOOR rattling at the far side of the room The
Little Girl (who we now realize is a YOUNG AMY) is screaming
on the other side We now know this door Her Father marches
toward it his rage building

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Back to scene

Amy screams out to him

AMY
Leave her alone

INT FATHERS OFFICE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
His hand tightens around the knob

He opens the door raising his free hand ready to strike a
powerful blow

YOUNG AMY stands there quietly with the sweetest smile on
her face

Then HE SEES THE KNIFE The BUTCHER KNIFE in YOUNG AMYS
HAND

But its over in a blink as she quickly buries it deep in his
chest

He stumbles back from the closet in slow-motion as-
INT HOSPITAL CORRIDORS
Amy screams She reacts to the violence

Her vision is blurring and fading fast as her life rushes out
of her

She turns back to her Father and everything is in slow-motion
as we-

INTERCUT
Her Father stumbling back
Amy losing consciousness

Her Father falling backwards The knife buried up to the
handle in his chest

Amy hitting her knees and wobbling there for a beat trying
to hold on

Her Fathers head falling backward
Amys head falling backward onto the floor
Young Amy stands there and stares without emotion

WE HOLD TIGHT ON AMYS FACE FROM ABOVE as her eyes flutter
closed

And then- Young Amy all alone in the world Stands there over
the body We see for the first time a smile from the young
girl
INT WINTERS ROOM - DAY

AMYS EYES SNAP OPEN as we quickly BOOM UP to find her lying
on a mattress in the middle of the floor surrounded by-

THE DEADERS Shes in the middle of the ritual The Deaders
are all chanting Marla and Joey are there

DEADERS (0C)
My skin isnt real My eyes arent real
My muscles arent real

(MORE)

DEADERS (contd)
My bones my heart my veins and nerves
and flesh and meat arent real What I
see what I hear what I taste what I
touch what I remember what I think
what I feel arent real

With a glance she can see that the PUZZLE BOX in its solved
configuration sits on a make-shift altar at the head of the

mattress

WINTER is towering over her at her feet He holds out a knife

-- THE FAMILIAR STILETTO -- for her to take
WINTER
Youve gone through this before Amy Go
through it again -- with me

Amy has a sudden look of resignation mixed with a little
relief She reaches out and slowly takes the knife from
Winter

WINTER
Thats it I knew you were the one The

second I saw you I knew you were the
one

The chanting continues

DEADERS
My skin isnt real My eyes arent real
My muscles arent real My bones my
heart my veins and nerves and flesh and
meat arent real What I see what I
hear what I taste what I touch what I
remember what I think what I feel
isnt real
Amy looks at Marla She looks deader then ever She chants
with the others Winter holds the knife closer for Amy

Amy looks at the PUZZLE BOX RAYS OF LIGHT start to stretch
out like hands and swirl from the PUZZLE BOX

THE ROOM STARTS TO RUMBLE

A BLACK VOID starts to take shape and swirl behind them
Winter is pleased

WINTER
Its working I knew it

He kneels down next to Amy

WINTER
Say it with us Amy You have to say it
with us

Amys hands start to tremble

AMY
I cant

WINTER
Yes you can Amy Youre one of us now
all you have to do is take this final
step and let the pain go And welcome a
world of ultimate pleasures
AN ARM bluish white stretches out from
the VOID trying to grab Joey who ducks
its grasp

The Deaders break the circle around Amy as more ARMS reach
out from the void The VOICES OF TORTURED SOULS twisted and
warped scream out for help in the wind that BURSTS out of
the void

HOOKS AND CHAINS reach out and grab the outstretched arms
dragging them back into the VOID Back into Hell

The Deaders turn to Winter -- theyre all a little freaked
out From the look on their faces its clear that this isnt

at all what they expected

JOEY
Where are the naked chicks The oil The
orgies

Its not what Winter expected either
WINTER

(calm)
Finish it Amy

AMY
I cant
WINTER
(screams)

Finish it
Amy steels herself with sudden resolve

AMY
I dont think so

And with that Amy SLAMS THE KNIFE Into the makeshift alter
next to her

And thats when-

PINHEAD steps through the void and into this world A few
CENOBITES follow

All the Deaders step back - this is weird even for them

Amy leaps up and stumbles back as Pinhead slowly approaches
Winter carefully studying him as he does until hes right
in Winters face

PINHEAD
I see that evil does run in the family

inter is plays it tough But its all an act

PINHEAD
Your lineage is of a craftsman You
should have stayed in the family
business I sacrificed my mortal self for
that box
WINTER
Its mine now It belongs to me

PINHEAD
Thats where youre painfully wrong We
belong to it

WINTER

It created you and it can destroy you
(to Amy)
Amy finish it

PINHEAD
When it is done with me -- perhaps -- but
m afraid ones own personal hell is
eternal as you will soon see

Pinhead takes in the Puzzle Box on the makeshift altar the
Deaders Amy

PINHEAD
The box is not just the map of the road --
it is the road itself

fq

WINTER
The ultimate experience

fq

PINHEAD
Experience is a funny thing boy it likes
to test us first and teach us later Are
you sure you can pass the test Are you
sure you want to

WINTER
You cant hurt me

Pinhead smiles

PINHEAD
Its not the first time Ive heard that

AND THEN ITS HOOKS AND CHAINS TIME

They reach out from the void all around Winter and stab into
him He screams out in complete agony as they tear at him and
stretch his limbs to the point of ripping them off

AND THEN THEY STOP
PINHEAD
And it wont be the last

Winters screams subside as a rush of pain surges through
him numbing him

Hes just able to turn his head to Pinhead and crack the
slightest fuck you smile

Winter tries to talk but the skin around his mouth is
stretched too tight

PINHEAD
When you attempted to challenge evil you
entered into my domain There is no way
in but through me

Pinhead gets in close to Winters face

PINHEAD
Careful what you wish for

Now we can see the terror in Winters eyes

PINHEAD
It just might come true

Winter screams as he is finally torn apart by the chains
Pinhead turns his attention to the DEADERS

PINHEAD
This world it obviously disappoints you
all Perhaps thats why you choose to
begin this journey And as long as you so
willingly accepted allow me to finish
off what he started

And out of the darkness an oversized MENACING CHAIN comes
FLYING OUT HARPOONING straight through the midsections of
all the deaders lined on the right side of Amy Piercing

them at all different levels
Then another chain HARPOONS the Deaders on the left side The
Deaders look like fish on a stringer They dangle there
suspended by the chains

PINHEAD
(to Amy)
And as for you You opened the box you
brought us all together You chose
wisely Im pleased

AMY
I didnt want any of this They used me
to open the box I didnt choose to do
anything
Amy looks to Marla shes got the fear of god in her Pinhead
sees Amy looking for help

PINHEAD
Shes one of us now Amy Now a guide to
the far reaches of pleasure To a world
where suffering is taken to higher level

AMY
Please

PINHEAD
You opened the box

AMY
I didnt mean to I only wanted the
truth
PINHEAD
And now you have it But knowledge comes
with a price -- and its time to pay
AMY

What about them

We see the CENOBITES now with snake-like tongues working
their way up the line of Deaders towards Amy Theyre
preparing each one as they pass Poking them with large pins
piercing them stitching them filleting them etc

PINHEAD
They belong to me now They offered
themselves willingly through him to me --
And now its time for you to do the same

Amy grabs the knife from the floor and points it at Pinhead

PINHEAD
It wont be that easy this time But yes
your Father is with us too And hes
waiting for you

These words pierce through Amy She looks at Marla now
barely hanging on to any signs of liveliness Her head lifts
up to Amy

ARLA
Youre here to stop this Amy He needs
your soul willingly Dont let him take
you Dont go willingly

Marla looks at the knife Amy gets it she only has one way
out Marla can see the uncertainty in her eyes

MARLA
Its over Winter is gone You cant come
back You wont become a Deaderor one
of them

Marla looks to Pinhead then back to Amy They both know what
she has to do

MARLA
(her final words)
Only he can bring you back

Amy sees the meat hanging off the chains It used to be
Winter She glares at Pinhead with a sudden look of
confidence like a light bulb has gone off and she can
finally see her way out She raises the knife high in front
of her

The two SNAKE-TONGUED CENOBITES move in closer to Amy They
cant wait to have a little taste

For a moment Pinhead is pleased then Amy begins the DEADER
CHANT but reverses its meaning

AMY PINHEAD
My skin IS real My eyes ARE Its too late to save
real My muscles are real My
bones my heart my veins and
nerves and flesh and meat
are real What I see what I
hear what I taste what I
touch what I remember what
I think what I feel is
real

yourself Your soul is mine
and mine alone Your Father
is waiting for you He misses
you so much

(louder)
The only way out Amy Klein --
is THROUGH ME

The Cenobites freeze for a beat and turn to Pinhead They

havent seen that before

She stares Pinhead right in the eyes

AMY

I didnt give my soul to him

Amy points the knife at whats left of Winter

AMY

and Im not giving it to you

And with that Amy thrusts the knife into her chest Pinhead

screams out

PINHEAD
No

The room starts to fill with a BRIGHT LIGHT The Puzzle Box

starts to close as-

Pinhead and the boys are sucked back into the void which

closes behind them

Amy looks up from the knife planted deep in her gut-

- AND SMILES She tips out of frame as the screen bleaches

white and we-

INT CHARLES RICKMANS OFFICE - DAY

SMASH CUT TO

Where we suddenly find ourselves lost in some bright
flickering space filled with the sound of static Abruptly
the static vanishes the flickering space congeals -- and we
realize that we are watching a television screen

And as we PULL BACK we realize that we are seeing a news
report on from SNN (Satellite News Network)

We are in Charless office Hes there watching this new
report

Images of what appear to be a terrible explosion fill the
frame (stock footage from a terrorist attack in London
perhaps) Cars on fire imploded building panic in the
street etc

The door opens and his assistant BETTY comes in She watches
Charles for a moment)

BETTY
I just talked to the Police Still
nothing Shes just gone Left her hotel
left her clothes left her money No sign
of her anywhere

CHARLES
See no Amy Hear no Amy

BETTY
Just like Marla Chen Apartment just left
empty No trace The police say its to
early to file an official report
(off his concerned look)
Do you think they she with foul play

CHARLES
(off the TV) I dont know I just dont
know

(beat)

Too bad too It would have made a hell
of a story (beat)
Im sure shell come walking in here any
minute carrying with her my story

Charles watches the report on the TV Pandemonium in the
streets

Its a hell of a story too It just gets
better and better And it looks like I
just may need somebody else crazy enough
to go get it

BETTY
Maybe you have Your three oclocks
here

Betty leans her head out of the room signalling someone out
in the hall to come in

A YOUNG BOMBSHELL REPORTER enters holds out her hand to
Charles who suddenly perks up as he takes it and leads her to
the couch

As he does we move past Charles and the young reporter to the

TV A REPORTER reports live from the scene of a terrible
explosion in-

REPORTER (VO)
Bucharest Romania

Over the continuing images of this destroyed building
surrounded by police cars and fire trucks the sirens
blaring over all the confusions Charles courts the reporter

CHARLES REPORTER (VO)

Miss Turner Its a pleasure Witnesses say the building
to meet you welcome you to located at the corner of

our team Lets cut right to Poteilari and Minvara just
it shall we imploded Firefighters have

I received this tape which I been on the scene for several
would like to show youand hours now Sources say the
well I think its a story only thing that seemed to

you could really wrap your survive the collapse of the
head around I hope your building was a this (she
willing to do so holds up the puzzle box) this

small relic found
incredibly undamaged

We move past the image of the puzzlebox on the TV and settle
on the FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of AMY AND CHARLES in happier times -
- smiling Probably the first time weve seen a smile on

AMYS FACE since the last time weve seen this picture

We get a sense that maybe shes finally at peace
FADE OUT

THE END
