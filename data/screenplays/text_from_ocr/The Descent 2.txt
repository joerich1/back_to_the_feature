you failed to close yesterday We
have no record of your return and
your listed outside contact has not
heard from you Please call us
urgently if you have forgotten to
sign back in If we don’t hear from
you we will assume you are still
underground and scramble an
emergency response

Flashlights finally pierce the black

DAN SHEPHERD leads his RESCUE TEAM - GREG and Cath - as they
edge sideways along a thin sloping seam

Dan’s 42 a geologist by training has an instinctive feel
for the rock An Englishman he is precise and spare in his
movements and manners

Cath’s 26 a conservationist who doubles as a rescue
volunteer

Gregs 22 a climbing instructor and extreme sports junkie
always first up for a thrill-ride

INT CAVES - DARKNESS
They reach a JUNCTION Dan gestures to Cath

She puts on headphones Sweeps each passage with a
directional microphone

Under the hiss SOMETHING FAINT It sounds like CLICKING

Cath turns up the dial Concentrates Half-heard against
electronic hum CLICK CLICK Fricative faintly human

Greg GLUGS his sports drink Dan silences him
They stand statues as Cath focuses frowns
CLICK CLICK Signs of life Or static hiss

Dan shines his torch in the direction of the microphone The
tunnel tapers to a crawlspace
He gives Greg the nod Greg disappears like a dachshund down
a rabbit hole Dan follows Then Cath

INT CRAWLSPACE - DARKNESS

Tight Claustrophobic The team wriggle on hands and knees as
the tunnel tapers ever tighter Rock bears down above

A false move dislodges stones and dust on Cath The dust
settles Cath settles herself

The team burrow on plunging through a FLOODED SECTION

DAN
I ever tell you Winston Churchill’s
motto KBO

CATH
KBO

DAN
Keep Buggering On

GREG
Who’s Winston Churchill

They KBO Into a STALAGMITE CHAMBER

Cath emerges last wet to a pat on the back from Dan The
slightest smile

CLICK CLICK

Their flashlights locate the source of the sound water
dripping on a discarded energy drink bottle

GREG
Could be them

CATH
(bagging the bottle)
Juno Kaplan’s no tourist She was
president of my college cave club

DAN
She good

CATH
She was a back-stabbing man-eating
bitch But she could cave

GREG
When can I meet her
CATH
She’s just your type A glory
hunter Always looking for
uncharted routes Not a team player-

Dan runs his hands along the wall dripping with water

DAN
Rainwater’s leaching through Few
hours this whole run’1ll be
flooded Come on

EXT SHEER ROCK WALL BOREHAM CAVERNS —- DAY
They climb a sheer rockface Methodically skillfully

Halfway up Greg bangs in a piton clips a carabiner to it
secures a new rope drops it over the overhang to Cath

As he climbs on he doesn’t see the piton slip from its
anchor position

As the piton takes the strain of Cath’s weight it POPS from
the wall Cath on the rope below falls away

Below stalagmite spikes await her falling body

Dan reacts fastest engages his body belay a mechanical
friction brake that grips on her safety rope and stalls her
descent

Stopping Cath inches above impalement

DAN
Time to turn back

He doesn’t let her see the friction burn on his hand

GREG
Give up Now

DAN
Rest up refocus

GREG
My focus’s fine

Dan holds up Greg’s loose nut Greg’s bravado slips in Cath’s
glare

DAN
Greg you ever ask yourself who
rescues the rescuers

From the way Rios locks eyes with Vaines it’s clear she’s
thinks this is a bad decision

EXT CHAPEL MINE - NIGHT
They drive along a perimeter fence
Deputy Lynch greets them at a gate

At the mine entrance the RESCUE TEAM’s TRUCK awaits Dan
Cath and Greg kitting up salute greetings

They advance inside Flashlights illuminate rusty cogs

SHAFT

Sarah drawn back into the darkness stiffens instantly
uneasy Vaines tries to read recognition in her response

RIOS
Sarah Is this familiar

Sarah is unresponsive(MRBhding at the shaft looking down
into the dark she retreats further into herself

VAINES
Hello This is Hyett County Sheriff
Department ANYBODY THERE

RIOS
Sarah You recognise anything here

All eyes on Sarah Sarah shrinks some limbic survival sense
tells her something’s not right

Dan shines his torch down the shaft his beam doesn’t
penetrate the depths of the darkness

DAN
She couldn’t have climbed up here

VAINES
It’s a big mountain I’m sure
there’s some foxhole somewhere she
coulda climbed out But we don’t
know it- and this takes us direct
to the main vein connects to the
cave system Right

DAN
No one knows those caves It’s
hostile down there And she looks
like a ghost

DAN (CONTD)

What if she has a major flashback
or flip-out or finds her friends
dead

VAINES
We don’t know they’re dead I just
want confirmation we’re in the
right arena Get the nod narrow
down the area

DAN
I don’t know Red Standard
procedure- you don’t take people
back down It’s me and two rookies
I can’t take responsibility for
her

VAINES
Dan we got five girls might still
be alive She’s the only one who’s
been down there There’s a million
miles of caves and fuck-all time
Bend the fuckin’ rules

DAN
Cath
(Cath nods)
Greg

Greg cracks a snap-light drops it down the shaft Finally it
hits bottom casts a dim glow from the distant base

GREG
Too far for our ropes We could
piggy-back on the elevator cables

VAINES
Why not just take the elevator

Greg and Cath examine the elevator’s cogs and gears

GREG
Bit creaky but basically sound

CATH
(to Dan)
Bit like you boss
Dan nods to Vaines let’s do it

Dan leads his rescue team into the cage

Sarah hesitates

VAINES
Something down there you want to
tell me about
(Sarah says nothing)

Deputy
Rios escorts Sarah into the lift
Vaines clanks closed the cage door
Sarah suddenly looks trapped
The elevator is packed with bodies Claustrophobic Rios
struggles for space Air Closes her eyes taking clandestine
deep breaths Opening her eyes she sees Vaines watching
her alive to her vulnerability

Vaines puts his hand on the release lever Dan and Greg take
the winches

Vaines releases the lever
The lift starts THE DESCENT

Sarah watches tombstone slabs of rock passing by inches from
her face Her dread rising as they descend

Above the drum wheel turns playing out lift cables The
wood shuttering CREAKS

Slowly the cage descends

To the terrible CLICK of ratchet teeth

Down down down Darkness swallowing them up

The square of light above them receding

Sarah’s eyes watching it go

Trying to ignore the GRINDING of the cables

Of an endless descent a descent into hell

Soundtracked by the CLICKCLICKCLICKof lift gears
It’s like Sarah is descending into her past her memories

The deeper they go the more dilapidated the mineshaft the
more degraded the mechanism

Nervous looks do they keep going

CLICKCLICK

Each click a little aural trigger in Sarah’s head
reverberating and distorting

CLICKCLICK
Little toxic timebombs threatening to burst in her head

FLASHFRAME The snap of a demonic jaw Too short and blurred
to comprehend long enough to shock

Her imagination in overdrive Sarah can barely breathe She
shuts her eyes trying to shut out the nightmare

But she can’t shut out the CLICK CLICK of ratchet teeth
The CLICK CLICK of sprocket teeth

That haunting inhuman CLICKING that rattles in her head
shards of memory stabbing through

Her eyes spring openSeeing

FLASHFRAME In the rock relief like a Goya devil a CRAWLER
snaps at Sarah

--Sarah snaps from her stupor
She THRASHES LASHES OUT
SARAH
DON’T GO DOWN THERE’S SOMETHING
DOWN THERE

Sarah lurches for the lever

VAINES
RIOS

Rios grabs for Sarah

Sarah slips her grasp catches the lever

The lever’s sudden change of direction grinds hard on the
teeth snapping one releasing the ratchet grip on the
elevator cable

The lift jolts down

Throwing its occupants over smashing them against the cage
and each other

As the gear teeth catch and re-engage the cage STOPS just as
suddenly throwing everyone down hard

But still Sarah struggles Rios spins her into an arm lock

VAINES
Rios you got her

But Sarah wants out She thrashes for freedom Rattles the
cage Vaines wades in to assist Together they cuff her to
its metal wall restrain her

RIOS
Sarah calm down It’s okay It’s
in your head Whatever you’re
seeing- it’s not real It’s trauma
Tricks of the brain You’re safe
The cables CREAK ominously the stressed metal GROANS
vaines gets right in Sarah’s face

VAINES
You remember something

RIOS
Chief the woman’s traumatised

VAINES
They down here They down here
(to Dan)
Get us to the bottom
Dan hesitates Vaines’s eyes brook no argument

Dan releases the lever They continue their descent

With teeth missing sprockets jag and slip on every
revolution the movement down is jerky and unsettling

Wary eyes flit between Sarah and the fractured mechanism
The lift grinds and stutters down
Finally CLANK

The cage THUDS against the stone floor at the bottom of the
shaft

The door at the bottom is bent buckled and rusted

Greg struggles to yank it partially open

They have to squeeze and struggle through the gap

Vaines and Rios escort Sarah out Vaines catches Dan’s look

Sarah huddles tight to a wall Small silent watchful Rios
attends to her

RIOS
You want a drink You remembered
something What did you remember
Trust me I want to help you

Sarah stares into the deep black darkness
Dan takes Vaines aside
DAN

I should never have let you bring
her down here

VAINES
You heard her Dan They’re down
here

DAN

The woman’s a fright She doesn’t
know what she’s saying

VAINES
Let me worry about her Let’s just
get to the cave

Beat

DAN
Down here I call the shots Right

INT MINE - LOWER LEVEL - SIDE TUNNEL - NIGHT

Flashlights Dan leads the group along a tapering TUNNEL
They squeeze past upturned coal carts rusted mining gear
Slow hard progress resolutely downward

Sarah sandwiched between Rios and Vaines watchful and
watched

DAN
Cave’s this way

INT INSECURE MINE TUNNEL —- DARKNESS

The team weave through pit props that have warped and shifted
from their foundations They creak and groan The roof is
partially collapsed riddled with cracks rains down regular
showers of dust

The threat of total collapse is ever present

Rios fights to rein in her claustrophobia fails to hide it
from Vaines Rios focusses on the job Sarah

RIOS
Recognise anything

Sarah sticks tight to the wall watchful Withdrawn Dan and
Cath share a worried look

Cath’s torch flickers Faulty
DAN
Cath how long have I been teaching

you Your light is your life

Greg tuts flicking his flashlight in Cath’s face Dan
catches him as he passes taps his shoulder

DAN
Teamwork

INT RELIEF TUNNELS - DARKNESS

Tight passages Hollows in the rough walls cast deep shadows
Form shapes like screaming faces

Sarah’s eyes search every corner for other movement

The shifting flashlights flick across the outline of a
figure hanging in shadow

Sarah freezes

Rios follows her look She too glimpses something in the
shadows

RIOS
There’s something there

Everybody swings their lights round They illuminate--
An old mining lamp hanging off a warped pit prop

Rios feels Vaines’s withering gaze

CATH
The dark does funny things to
people

RIOS
I’m fine

CATH

I’m scared of stuffed animals
Seriously She okay

RIOS

Greg runs his fingers across a vein of minerals glistening in
the wall He picks up and pockets a glinting nugget

GREG
Goddamned gold mine

CATH
Fool’s gold

DAN
Should hit the cave system
somewhere up here

The team turn a corner into a GALLERY littered with old
lamps helmets Dan picks up an old Davey lamp sparks it up

DAN
Blue flame shows the presence of
methane

Dan checks his gas meter on his belt it flashes red showing
a high methane count

DAN
Woh Watch for sparks Secure all
loose metal crampons picks nuts
Guns

Flashlight falls on a gnarled horse skeleton on the floor
Its skull stares up incisors open as if screaming

An unnerving sight met with silence
Sarah’s stares remembering

VAINES
What’s that A pit pony

Dan scours the crime scene claw marks run down one wall

DAN

Miners probably hit a methane

pocket Looks like the poor

bastards tried to claw their way

out
Sarah stares at the claw marks
Shaken by the flashback Sarah shrinks against the wall
Vaines eagle-eyed nods to Rios

RIOS
Sarah help me help you- you know
something What do you know

CATH
Up here

A CRACK in the rocks Greg clears a crawlspace through the
rocks

GREG (0S)
It’s the cave

Greg burrows through a crack in the rocks Disappears

GREG (0S)
We’re getting warm

Greg appears Holding a cracked snaplight
GREG

Greg pulls out his thermal imaging camera A small robust
device with a pistol-grip Body heat registers on its screen
as red hot spots as he pans across the various members of the
team as they probe the various tunnels

He probes the shadows Nothing
Rios sits with Sarah trying to coax some answers out of her

Sarah- Anything you can tell us-

A sudden ferocious intervention Sarah tries to smother Cath
from speaking Both Dan and Greg compete to assist Cath

The police officers take Sarah

The team clamber through the tight tunnel

VAINES
Hello Hello

Sarah surveys the dark terrified what their shouts will
attract No one notices as Sarah grabs a weapon of her own a
sharp flint fragment She slips it into her trousers

The team reach a JUNCTION THREE TUNNELS confront them

Dan’s light catches a glint in the MIDDLE TUNNEL

CATH
What’s that

Dan and Cath go into the tunnel

Cath picks up A woman’s caving boot Almost brand new
Everyone immediately understands its importance

CATH
Rock’ard That’s a British brand

All eyes turn to Sarah

VAINES
If the boot fits-

The way Sarah stares at the boot is recognition enough for
Vaines who shines his light up the TUNNEL

Rios follows

Cath moves round to the far corner of the cavern

Cath stops at the SOUND Everyone notices she’s picked up on
something There’s silence Silence

CLICK
Cath points something’s down there

They edge towards the dark far corner Sarah on high-alert
slows but Vaines pushes her on

Dan signals to a halt Because the flashlights faintly pick
out something in the shadowy corner

A person sitting on the ground leaning against a wall

Dan and Vaines exchange a look Justified in his decision to
come this way Vaines takes control Pushes forward Sees--

A woman Head turned away Face not visible But the woman’s
jaw is moving Working up and down like she’s mumbling to
herself Everyone tenses

VAINES
She’s still alive

The woman’s “chattering” teeth CLICK again
Sarah can barely breath

VAINES
Miss You okay Miss

Vaines moves closer Reaches out Touches the woman’s face
Her head lolls sideways

It’s REBECCA
Dead Half of her face is missing Ripped away But eerily
her jaw is still chattering Vaines edges in to look Slowly

a fat rat slips out from inside her mouth

VAINES

The group reels backwards
Sarah’s legs buckle she struggles to breathe
Rios goes to the body Examines it

RIOS
The main arteries are severed

All eyes on Sarah Vaines looks accusatory

VAINES
Who did this Do you know who did
this

RIOS

Chief it’s her friend-

VAINES
If she’s innocent she’1ll wanna
help us help her friends

Sarah catches Rios’s non-committal look

GREG
Woh wait a minute I thought she
was a victim here What are you
saying you think she’s a suspect
(silence)
This is fucking crazy Fucking
crazy bringing her down here

VAINES

disciplined

Rios’s flashlight settles on a scrap of Rebecca’s clothing
just inside a TIGHT TUNNEL that disappears into the rock

She came this way

Vaines scrutinises her to see if she hesitates Rios
determined not to nods squeezes into the tunnel

Vaines turns to Sarah

VAINES
You don’t leave my sight

Sarah doesn’t move Vaines shoves her in bulldozing himself
in behind her

VAINES
Rios’1l be right in front of you
Ill be right behind

IN THE TIGHT TUNNEL-—

The deeper Rios crawls the narrower the tunnel Squeeze
tight A claustrophobe’s constrictive hell She couldn’t even
turn back if she wanted to And compounding her fears Sarah
scrambling behind contributing to the bottle-neck

IN THE DRIPPING CAVE--

Dan and Cath alone She gives him a little smile
disappears down the hole

Alone with Rebecca’s body Dan’s smile slips
IN THE TIGHT TUNNEL--
Greg sees the end of the tunnel It opens into a NEW CHAMBER

As Greg disappears around a bend ahead Rios loses sight of
him Alone with her fears she is floundering Her fears are
winning Starting to panic she snags herself fights free
dislodging rock dust She clenches at the prospect of the
imminent crush The roof doesn’t fall in but the weight of
rock hangs over her like a vast tombstone slab

Meanwhile Sarah crawls fast and catches up with Rios
Behind Sarah Vaines struggles to keep up

Slow down

Sarah ignores him Cursing Vaines redoubles his effort
INT CAVE SYSTEM - HONEYCOMB JUNCTION - DARKNESS

Greg pulls himself out the TUNNEL takes off his helmet
composes himself Shines his flashlight round

The stone wall is pocked like honeycomb black hollows lead
off in every direction

Rios collapses out the tunnel She gulps air
hyperventilating Greg attends to her

GREG
Breathe with me Inand outand

Seeing he’s trying to lighten the tone Rios finds a smile
But looking back at where she came from chills her

RIOS
I can’t do that again

GREG

RIOS
I can’t

IN THE TUNNEL--
Vaines out of shape makes slow progress struggles on
IN THE HONEYCOMB JUNCTION

Sarah crawls out twitchy and watchful Her eyes search every
shadow

RIOS
What is it

Greg swings his light across the large cave

GREG
It’s nothing

But he’s not sure He scans his thermal imaging around
nothing Only the three hotspots of their bodies

RIOS
Calm down it’s just in your head

GREG

You gotta try and be like me big

empty space between your ears
But something registers in Sarah’s eyes
SUDDENLY A RED FILLS HIS TI SCREEN A FOURTH HOT SPOT

Vaines hears SCREAMS ahead but his view is blocked by the
twisting tunnel He can only hear the echoing sounds of an
attack with its attendant GRUNTS GROANS STRIKES
SCUFFLING

No reply Vaines bulls his way through the twisting tunnel

Rounding a bend his view still obscured by rock he glimpses
shadows on the wall human shapes fighting

Fighting forwards Vaines’s gunbelt snags on the sidewall
FURTHER BACK Cath hears the ATTACK

IN THE DRIPPING CAVE--

Then listens as SILENCE and STATIC HISS replace SCREAMS

into the honeycombs tunnels

Vaines goes to her aid

Rios what the hell happened here
Where did she go

image plays back the frenzied attack just shapes- but the
impression is undeniable- one human form jumping at another

RIOS
I don’t know what happened

VAINES

Vaines looks at her with contempt

Vaines spots bloody drag-marks leading into one of the
honeycomb tunnels Drawing his gun he follows the blood

Ten feet down Vaines catches a glimpse of movement gives
chase deeper into the honeycombs

Suddenly SCUFFLING SOUNDS in shadows draw his beams

Frustrated with his flashlight’s limited range he switched
to TI Holding his gun in his other hand he tracks

Through corkscrew tunnels

Alert to ambush points at every corner

VAINES
Sarah Sarah this is Chief Vaines
I know you’re scared Let’s just
take it easy talk this out
A humanoid hot spot skids across his thermal imaging frame
Vaines hunts it out scouring the darkness
From nowhere a red figure suddenly FILLS his thermal image

Rushing him Right on him Slashing at him

BOOM Vaines FIRES A SHOT off deflecting the attacker just
as it SLAMS into him and knocks his flashlight aside

SEISMIC SHIFTS occur above their heads

They look up and see the roof vibrate a horrendous RIFT
appear

Then like apples on a shaken tree the STALACTITES start to
fall To rain down on thema rain of spears

They have to run to clear them Dodging and weaving Inches
from impalement

Cath stumbles A stalactite spear lands inches from her
face striking through the climbing ropes around her
shoulder

Pinned down she fights to free herself

The others make it to the shelter of a SIDE TUNNEL

Rewind it Rewind

As Rios fumbles with the Camcorder trying to rewind their
light spill illuminates

A CRAWLER Right behind them

The Crawler HISSES Dan and Rios gasp
Rios drops the camcorder
They scatter into the dark Hide

Rios hunkers down behind a large rock her eyes straining
into the darkness

Dan hyper-alert listens out for the danger

Their torches cut the cave looking for danger

The camcorder still plays on the ground the disorientated
terrified girls call to each other

BETH (ON SCREEN)
It’s circling us

SAM (ON SCREEN)
Where is it

REBECCA (ON SCREEN)
It’s here somewhere Fuck it’s
there-

In an eerie echo Dan and Rios don’t know where the danger
lurks in the dark

Neither dare move
Rios reaches for her holster But her gun’s not there
They call out to each other tentatively in the dark

Rios stiffens hearing SCUTTLING

DAN
Deputy Deputy you okay

I’m over here

The CAMCORDER’S LCD SCREEN casts a ghostly glow in

disembowelling Holly’s corpse

He fumbles towards the camcorder- which lies nearer to Rios
BREATHING POV Rios’s back stalked
Rios blinking in the dark Utterly blind Senses something

A pale bloody hand grabs Rios from behindA hand claws
round Rios’s mouth A sharp bone to her throat

It’s Sarah
She pulls Rios down Covers her mouth Rios resists

Sarah presses her piton to Rios’s throat Rios stops
resisting

In the dim light cast by the nearby camcorder Rios sees the
crawler in front of her stalking her

Sarah holds her still silent

DAN

The crawler senses its prey Turns Towards Dan’s voice

DAN
Deputy

And Sarah lets it go Rios is forced to watch the fatal
convergence

DAN
Deputy you okay I’m nearly there

Sarah holds tight Not alerting him Not silencing him
Sentencing him to death

Grabbing the camcorder Dan stops the playback Fiddles to
change the mode to nightvision

He scans the camera round

DAN
Okay Deputy I can see-

Rios held silent hostage by Sarah Gasps

Something POPS into the foreground of his screen
A CRAWLER JAWS WIDE COMING RIGHT AT HIM

Sharp teeth sever Dan’s jugular and vocal chords He lets out
horrible wet harking gasps for air and for help

The dying Dan starts to crawl towards Sarah and Rios Pulling
himself along on his back with the little strength he’s got

Rios looks to Sarah Sarah holds still steely No choice but
to let him die

His hand reaches Sarah just as the Crawler rips open his
belly

The Crawler looks up from Dan tilts its head senses the
air

CLICK CLICK Sensing in Rios and Sarah’s direction

It edges towards them

Sarah and Rios stay stock-still Silent Terrified

Sarah stares at the Crawler Rios breathes fast and shallow
behind Sarah’s hand as they both watch the Crawlermove
away

The Crawler CLICKS again

Faint CLICKS come in reply from down a TUNNEL

The Crawler turns Leaves down the TUNNEL

It’s gone

Sarah releases Rios who rushes over to Dan Her training

kicks in she pushes his innards back into his belly tries
to stem the blood pumping from his neck

RIOS
Come on Dan Hold on
(to Sarah)

Help me
Sarah watches her But Dan’s finally gone
Rios looks at Dan in horror Then at Sarah in contempt

RIOS
You just let him die

Sarah shrugs past her works fast she strips Dan of his belt
and equipment

Rios watches appalled at Sarah’s ruthlessness
Sarah tools up pockets Dan’s flares flashlight the
camcorder Takes the LAMINATED MINE MAPS Secures Dan’s belt

around her own waist Slots his pick in it

She stands gives Rios a last look moves towards a TUNNEL at
the far end of the cave

RIOS
Stop Stop

Sarah stops by Beth’s corpse Stares down at Beth Stares
back at Rios

RIOS
How can you be so fucking cold

Sarah says nothing Doesn’t move
Rios realises why two Crawlers have entered the CAVE

Rios shuts up Freezes Will the same thing happen again
with Rios as Sarah’s escape bait this time

As softly as she can Rios creeps closer to Sarah

Across the cave Sarah stands stock still

The crawlers stand between them

Finally the Crawlers turn away rush Dan’s body Snarling at
one another they slowly drag him from the CAVE (in the
direction Dan and Rios entered) They’re gone

Taking Beth’s pick Sarah is already halfway up the TUNNEL

Faced with being alone in this hell Rios scuttles to keep
up

INT COLLAPSED CAVE - DARKNESS

Cath tries to build a support wall from the stones to hand
something to buy her enough time to wriggle free

It’s fiddly work in cramped conditions Just as she wedges in
an anchoring stone her wall collapses threatening to bring
down the rocks above her

Suffering the psychological torment of another near miss
Cath sighs a deep breath

She tries to inch her way out But the creaking rock above is
enough to deter her

She tries her radio

Stops She hears something in the dark Movement

No reply

Then a faint CLICKING
Cath flashes her light trying to attract attention

CATH
HELP PLEASE OVER HERE

There’s definitely someone there

Cath strains her neck peers through a chink in the rock
A CRAWLER EYE glares back at her
She jolts back in shot
The eye has gone The Crawler’s vanished
Terrified Cath sweeps her flashlight round
Nothing
CATH
It’s just the dark The dark fucks
with your head It’s not real

Then the crawler comes back- with a vengeance

At her feet Fighting to find a way through the rubble to get
at her

Reaching its arm through the rubble at her Clawing at her
Champing at her

Cath tries to fight it off Kicking scuffling Nowhere to
go Every defensive move risks bringing the rocks down on
her Cath faces an impossible choice either the crawler will
get her- or she’1ll be crushed

The crawler burrows closer working its way for her neck

As the crawler lunges Cath risks everything moving sharply
slamming a rock into its face

It falls hard Into her support wall Becoming its last
piece

As the crawler’s body takes the weight of the rocks above
Cath seizes her opportunity wriggles hard

First crawler ribs start to snapThen it’s skull starts
splitting

Cath crawls for her life She just squeezes out the narrow
gap Grabs for her trailing flashlight as-

CRUNCH and CRACK- the crawler’s skull shatters and bones as
the crushing rocks make powder of its bones and paste of its
flesh

Cath fills her lungs in shock

Cath still panicked charges through the tunnels

CATH
Dan Dan you there Please Dan

She stops suddenly

Her torch beam REVEALS

Recessed shelves gouged out of the tunnel wall
Cath edges to a shelf Directs her light towards-
A skeleton

Cath jumps in shock

The skeleton is seemingly human Laid out on the shelf as if
in a coffin

Moving down the TUNNEL Cath shines her light into the other
shelves Finds dozens of skeletons Then more recent corpses
Flesh traces still cling to the bones

Beyond them are freshly excavated shelves Scratch marks
round their entrances She nears one Shines her light in
Comes face to face

With a Crawler

Cath jumps back She fights to rein in her fear What the
hell is this

But the Crawler doesn’t move It’s dead A hole in its
forehead

Cath looks into the shelf above Finds another dead Crawler
All the skeletons are Crawlers not humans

This is some sort of CRAWLER CATACOMB

She looks back to the second dead Crawler Its eyes have been
gouged out (These are the Crawlers Sarah and Juno killed)

Amidst the bodies one moves

Cath tucks herself away
Terrified

she raises her pick to defend herself

The crawler closes in coming from the corner

Cath readies to strike-

We thought you were- what happened

GREG
One of these freaks attacked I
just ran

CATH
You ran

Greg struggles to bear his deep shame

CATH
Have you seen any of the others

GREG
I’ve been on my own I thought I
was going mad Oh God Cath it’s
good to see you

Cath slaps him

CATH
Greg get a grip

CLI-- CLI-- CLICK-- A conversation-killer

A Crawler MURMUR comes from the tunnel beyond Soft Low
Like weeping

Through the catacombs they see A FEMALE CRAWLER The Crawler
has a swollen belly It’s pregnant

Next to the Pregnant Crawler is a Crawler corpse The

Pregnant Crawler washes water over the corpse from a nearby
pool Cleans it tenderly Emitting soft clicks Mourning

Around her a FUNERAL PARTY of grieving crawlers

Cath and Greg back away

Cath points to a far exit Their only way out

Past the mourning crawler mother

Greg shakes his head Cath nods It’s the only way
Greg tiptoes towards the exit on the far side

INT TUNNEL —- DARKNESS

vVaines hears FAINT MOVEMENT again He swings his light Finds

nothing Heartbeat rising he moves to a TUNNEL JUNCTION
Directs his beam into each tunnel

DRIP DRIP DRIP

Something oozes onto Vaines’ shoulder Vaines touches the
substance Holds it to his light

Viscous liquid

Just then a SHADOW moves behind Vaines

Sensing movement Vaines spins

An arm swings towards him from the ceiling Hits his face
Vaines flails back terrified Veers his light up Finds--

Dan’s dead body hanging upside down from a crack in the
ceiling Eviscerated

Vaines stumbles fights down his urge to gag
He draws his gun hand shaking

VAINES
Jesus

With shaking hands Vaines reaches for Dan’s radio But as
grabs it Dan’s body falls Vaines leaps away

His pulse racing Vaines unclips Dan’s radio

VAINES
Can anyone hear me Dan’s dead
Sarah Carter’s killed him

INT CATACOMBS - DARKNESS
Greg and Cath tantalisingly close to the exit when
VAINES (ON RADIO)

-Greg Cath You hear
Dans dead kill

he

The Funeral Crawlers raises their heads HISS

VAINES (OVER WALKIE-TALKIE)
Come i Greg Co in

Cath snaps off her radio Hardly dares look
Gregs eyes search round Meet Cath’s

GREG
Run

INT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
Greg and Cath run for their lives
They hit a dead end
They have to turn back
They hear crawlers coming There’s nowhere to go
Down the tunnel crawlers click sensing the air
But Cath and Greg have gone
The crawlers stop sensing out their victims
High above wedged back to back with their feet pressed to
either side of the wall a climber’s hold Cath and Greg
strain to keep still and silent
Finally the crawlers scuttle past
Greg and Cath drop down
Cath desperately tries her radio
CATH (INTO RADIO)
Anyone there Chief Vaines This is
Cath You there Come in

Lonely static crackle Despair consumes her

CATH
Dans dead

GREG
We don’t know that

CATH
I know what I heard

GREG
It wasn’t clear

CATH
Vaines had his radio

GREG
Whoever it was he can’t be far We
got a signal We gotta find them

Cath’s facade quivers cracks

CATH
Hold me Greg

They cling tight

CATH
You won’t run out on me

GREG
Out there on my own I was so
scared Together- we’re a team

CLICK CLICK

GREG
There’s more of them

CATH
Come on

They charge off through the tunnel
Glimpsing Crawlers giving chase

Hearing their horrible SCUTTLINGS as they pursue them
through

Tapering tunnels sharp turns
INT GORGE CAVERN - LEDGE - CONTINUOUS

They stop just as suddenly Teetering on the edge of a GORGE
with a vertiginous drop below

As Cath moves her light back up she illuminates

SAM From the first film Dead

Still hanging upside down from a rope in the rock ceiling
One of her arms is missing - the shoulder is chewed to the

bone Her innards are spilled over her sides

Cath lurches back in horror Greg looks at Cath looks back
into the tunnel they came down SCUFFLING

Ahead a deadly drop Cath scans the roof for a route Sam’s
rope snakes back through pitons along the roof

Greg thinks fast slams a piton into their near wall loops
the rope through it pulls it taut The gravity of Sam’s
bodyweight tugs the other end tight

GREG
Gets us halfway
(raising his pick)
I’1l hold them off
They lock eyes Greg looks determined to make amends
Cath sets out hand over hand

Cath makes it to Sam Her decaying body a sticky putrid
maggot-ridden obstacle Cath slides down

Cath climbs up the body hooking her pick in Sam’s ribs as a
hold Reaching the roof she hooks in another piton Secures
a secondary rope to it

Behind Greg CLICKING and SCUFFLING Crawlers closing

CATH
Greg

Cath tosses the rope back
Just as the crawlers crowd him Greg swings

Swings across the cavern slamming into the far side
Gripping hard he claws his way onto the far ledge

Sees a crawler climbs across the rope towards Cath who
dangles vulnerable like a fly on a spider web caught
between the crawlers and Greg

GREG
Cath Throw me the rope I’1l
secure it Cath

But she doesn’t Instead she pulls her pick

CATH
Run Run

GREG
Cath no

But Cath turns to fights the crawler Swinging with her pick

The pitons strain under the triple weight of Sam Cath and
the crawler

Gregs fixing on the crawler side wall shifts POPS

Greg can only watch as Cath Sam and the crawler fall 50
feet

INTO A WATER POOL

The fight continues Underwater as the water turns red the
light source dies in the water

Greg is alone again

INT STREAMPOOL CAVE - DARKNESS

Sarah and Rios follow the stream - which is now deeper At
the end of the TUNNEL the water tumbles down step-like rocks
into an OVULAR cave

Sarah climbs down the rock steps Rios slips Follows

Water flows in from side passages to form a pool

Sarah looks into the pool- sees a CRAWLER’S FACE where her
reflection should be

She spins round to attack it

But it’s only Rios there Rios thinks she’s being attacked
Until she sees

The CRAWLER emerges from UNDER the water

Sarah spins round in time to bury a pick into its neck
Killing it

Sarah looks around her senses attuned to the possibility of
reinforcements

At the far-end of the cave water drains slowly into a TUNNEL
that’s almost entirely submerged

There’s only a GAP of a foot between the water and the
ceiling Sarah wades in Heads towards the SUBMERGED TUNNEL

RIOS
We’re not going in that

Sarah gives her a look she’s going it’s up to her if she
follows

Sarah wades on the water now up to her chest

Desperately unhappy Rios follows It’s freezing but Rios
forces herself in deeper and deeper

INT ELSEWHERE IN THE CAVES —- DARKNESS

Vaines stares into the dark ahead Then from the TUNNEL
behind Vaines hears MOVEMENT He spins his light into the
TUNNEL

VAINES
Hello Somebody there Show
yourself

Just beyond his light Vaines senses more movement
Nothing Adrenaline rising Vaines moves into the TUNNEL

Breathing POV Vaines shine his flashlight round unaware
he’s being watched

INT SUBMERGED TUNNEL - DARKNESS

Sarah and Rios move down the TUNNEL Their helmets scrape the
roof Only their heads are out the water Rios’s on the verge
of outright panic

Ahead they see that the roof dips dramatically into the
water It looks like a solid wall

RIOS
It’s a dead end
SARAH
The water’s flowing There’s a way
through
(beat)
I’m not going to wait for you
RIOS
No please wait please I can’t
SARAH
(cold)

It’s all in your head
And Sarah disappears into the water
Rios watches terrified

RIOS
No Oh God Oh God

Rios tries to summon up enough courage to follow Sarah

She takes a deep sobbing breath Dives down

UNDERWATER-—

Rios’s helmet lamp illuminates suspended silt Her hands
search down down Rios finds a way forward

It’s a TIGHT LETTERBOX TUNNEL She contorts into it Grapples
along her air running out

Eventually the space opens up She scrabbles upwards in
desperation Her head comes above water into a

VERY LOW BREATHE-SPACE--

Rios’s helmet hits the roof Only her eyes are above the
surface She sees Sarah’s face tilted so that her nose and
mouth are just out the water

Rios copies Sarah Gulps air

SARAH
Lose the helmet

Sarah shines her flashlight ahead The roof dips down again

SARAH
And don’t think

Sarah takes off her helmet Moves backwards face upwards
Now there’s only an inch above the surface Rios copies her
Rios and Sarah’s noses brush the ceiling for a few horrendous
metres their eyes wide in the murky water

Finally the roof rises giving them several inches of breathe-
space Rios’s shivering Terror-stricken They put their
helmets back on Move further Come to another wall

RIOS
No Please not again

Sarah just takes a breath Ducks into the water Disappears
into the gloom

Rios chokes back her dread takes deep breaths Ducks down
into the water too

UNDERWATER-—

Rios feels the rock with her hands Finds a way through
Scrambles through the churned gritty water

The gap opens up wider higher A new chamber
Rios swims up to the surface

But there is no surface

There’s no breathe-space at all She just comes up against
rock She smacks the roof with her hands in disbelief
Bubbles escape her mouth She looks round realises she has
to keep going

She dives deeper her lungs aching Frantically pulls herself
under another dip in the rock Clawing through Running out
of air fast Gradually the rock above her rises She swims
upwards Hoping there’ll be air Finally she surfaces Into--

ANOTHER AIR POCKET--—

This new chamber is small Tight Only her head is above the
water She gulps air But now looking round she realises

She’s alone

RIOS
Sarah Sarah

Rios looks round treading water not knowing what to do
Shivering her breathing reverberates Water laps into her
mouth makes her cough Her fear and desperation rise fast

RIOS
Oh fuck

She knows she’s going to die in here That she’1ll drown
never to be found And then she sees

A shadow moving under the water towards her

Rios shifts away from it terrified BUBBLES pop on the
water’s surface The shadow rises

UNDERWATER-—

From the POV of whatever’s coming for her we see Rios’s arms
and legs flailing A pale arm reaches out Grabs her

IN THE BREATHE-SPACE-—

Rios screams Thrashes around to get free And then the thing
surfaces next to her Rios screams Then realises

It’s Sarah
RIOS
(clings to Sarah)

You came back

SARAH
Save your breath

Sarah dives down pulling Rios with her

UNDERWATER-—

Together they move through the water following the rock as
it dips down then corkscrews left and right It’s extremely
tight But Sarah pulls Rios along

They move upwards into
INT PYRAMID CAVE - DARKNESS

Sarah and Rios surface in a long pool fill their lungs with
air

The water flows towards the far point of the pool

Sarah wades forward Sees that the water is being sucked into
a tight crack in the rock Not even big enough to get an arm
through There’s no way to track the water onward

SARAH
No

Her emotionless face breaks She smacks the rock blocking her
escape Then pulls herself out onto rocks at the side

RIOS
There’s no way through That’s it

Sarah doesn’t respond Shivering Rios looks round She’s not
willing to give up Three walls meet at the cave’s apex
There’s a rough “window” halfway up a wall that leads to a
PASSAGEWAY

RIOS
There must be a way You found a
way

Sarah downcast runs her hand through the-

SARAH
Water

RIOS
I thought you’d left me

No response Rios pulls out her cellphone to bring up a photo
of Emily

RIOS
This is my daughter

No response Rios slips around a rock switches her phone
into the VIDEO RECORDER application

She tries to compose herself to look happy Then she turns
the camera on herself RECORDS

RIOS
Luz this is mummy I just want you
to know how much I love you How
proud I am What a lovely girl you
are You be good and kind and
caring You live a good life Te
quiero te estrafio

As Rios’s voice cracks Sarah listens Something in her
softens

Rios tries to compose herself returns around the rock
offers the phone to Sarah

Sarah shakes her head

SARAH
My daughter died

RIOS
I’m so sorry

SARAH
She was my world

There’s a sympathy here

Suddenly illuminated in the opposite corner of the cave -
across the water - is JESSICA with her birthday cake Sarah
melts But then makes a decision to look away She looks back
to where Jessica was sitting Jessica is gone

Rios has watched all of this with slight alarm

Sarah takes out the maps from her belt nods up at the
‘window’ in the rock above

SARAH
Vent shafts All deep mines have
them to get air to the miners If
we can follow a seam break back
through into the mine find one of
these shafts-

RIOS
What’s the scale of this map

SARAH
You don’t want to know

INT CAVE - DARKNESS

Greg struggles on cold thirsty alone

Behind him CLICKCLICK something stirs

Greg spins round arcs his flashlight

Something is stalking him scurrying in the shadows
He lights a flare throws itHoping to scare them off
As Greg retreats the hot light of the flare casts shadows
CRAWLERS Two of them Nosferatu was never so sinister
Greg’s seen enough Runs

INT CAVE - CONTINUOUS

Greg bolts in blind panic

But he’s not as fast as his pursuers

Closing on him in the dark

They jump on his back Maul him One sinks its teeth into his
torso Greg shrieks The other scratches at his legs

Greg kicks and swats and bats them off
Finally Greg gets a good look at his attackers
Their shadows made them look bigger than they are

Two TWINS They’re so small that Greg just stares
bewildered These little Crawlers seem almost cute

Then both twins SNARL viciously showing razor teeth

GREG
FUCK THIS YOU LITTLE FUCKS

All this fears and frustrations fuse into RAGE

The TWINS regroup They’re not adept at hunting yet but
they’re learning fast They close in on Greg

TWIN 1 leaps onto his back rips into his arm as TWIN 2 claws
at his face

Greg knocks Twin 2 away to the floor

He backs hard against the wall- winding Twin 1 But it holds
on tight Spinning Greg sees a sharp rocky outcrop backs
hard into it Impaling the creature It falls off Dead
Enraged Twin 2 launches at Greg Sinks it’s teeth into him

Its teeth still sunk in his arm Greg bashes its head against
the wallagain and again till it falls

Then in his bloodlust he stamps on its head Makes crushed
watermelon of its skull

Greg stumbles back shocked exhausted

He looks down at the dead TWINS

Takes in what he’s just done

Catches his breath

Wipes the blood from his face

SLAM A FEMALE CRAWLER sideswipes Greg from out of nowhere
Then it looks from the dead TWINS to Greg furious

But Greg’s done with running He’s not going down without a
fight

As the Crawler advances Greg holds his ground
He pulls the drill from his belt His finger on the trigger

At the last minute he turns it on thrusting its spiralling
bit towards the Crawler

The WHIRRING NOISE fills the Tunnel
But the Crawler hears it coming Swipes it away
Greg turns swinging the drill round

But the Crawler is faster sinks its jaws into him Bites his
hand off at the wrist

Greg’s hand - still holding the spinning drill - falls to the
ground

SLASH The crawler slashes Greg’s tendons
He finds himself falling face-first
Towards the spinning drill bit clamped in his own fingers

THRRRR-SSSS He drills through his own eye Dead

The Female Crawler attends to the bodies of the dead TWINS

She tilts her head and emits a keening SCREECH A mother’s
tragedy - a call to arms

INT JAGGED CAVE - DARKNESS

Sarah and Rios hear the PRIMAL SCREECH echo They exchange a
worried look Hurry to a hole in the rock Rios hesitates
staring into the extremely tight hole

Sarah contorts herself into the tiny TUNNEL

difficulty Rios squeezes in Crawls along Fighting her
fear
INT TUNNELS - DARKNESS
Vaines presses on
Hearing MOVEMENT behind him he spins
A FIGURE shifts quickly into darkness

But as Vaines aims his light the figure’s gone

Vaines settles his beam on a SMALL OPENING low in the rock
He pulls his gun ducks down

Inches into the OPENING Shines his light inside

It’s a DARK TUNNEL Vaines squints into the darkness scans
his flashlight at

Two eyes glaring back

SLAM The FIGURE launches at Vaines who tries to fight it
off

But it’s too fast and strong It pins Vaines down Flashes a
climbing axe Vaines stares up in fear

away

Sarah contorts herself through a kink in the rock

Rios catches her hip Twists Wedging herself tighter Her
breathing gets bigger

Sarah twists herself reaches a hand back

SARAH

Luz that means light
RIOS

Yeah
SARAH

She boss you around
RIOS

Yeah
SARAH

When did she last boss you around
RIOS

She wanted shoes like her friend

Lottie’s With flashing lights

SARAH
Did you buy them

RIOS
Yeah

Smiles With Sarah’s help Rios relaxes enough to ease
through the kink

SARAH
Stick with those shoes They’1l get
you out
Then Sarah’s helmet light picks something up ahead of them
A CRAWLER

It’s several metres ahead blocking their way It licks water
off the rock oblivious to Sarah and Rios’s presence

Sarah tries to tease out her pick but as she moves the
Crawler lifts its head CLICKS Sensing

Sarah freezes Rios hears the CLICKS Panics

RIOS
We can’t go back We can’t turn

And then ahead of them a RAT emerges from a hole in the
floor of the tunnel The hole is covered with WEBS and DIRT
but the rat pushes through Sniffs

Sarah stares at the hole The only way out now

The rat scuttles towards Sarah’s face Sniffs at her open
eyes Sarah can’t help but flinch Startled the rat SQUEAKS

The Crawler reacts instantly Stares RIGHT at Sarah with its
dead eyes Sarah stares back She has no choice

She moves as fast as she can Right at the Crawler

RIOS
Sarah

But the Crawler’s coming at them It’s a race to the HOLE

Sarah gets there first She pushes through the webs A
“chimney” leads straight down But its walls are moving

It’s alive with BUGS

Sarah cracks a flare Throws it at the Crawler who
instinctively rears back Sarah dives into the BUG HOLE

As Sarah disappears the Crawler SCREECHES at Rios But it’s
kept at bay by the fizzing flare Rios shuffles faster Dives
headfirst into the BUG HOLE But the Crawler catches her
trailing ankle

INT BUG HOLE - CONTINUOUS

The walls heave with insects They cover Rios’s face and
body Scurry into her hair and clothes Rios screams

in its hand

And lands in a mire of putrid sludge Rios’s in a LONG LOW
CAVE with many exits She stands hysterically brushing
insects off herself as Sarah watches

RIOS
It’s on me It’s on me

SMACK From the hole above The Crawler lands on Rios
Plunging her back into the sludge Sarah moves fast

BAM Sarah buries her pick into the Crawler’s face with all
her might Then levers the pick so it tears through the
Crawler’s brain The Crawler screams in agony

Sarah plunges the pick into the Crawler’s chest Twists
Blood spurts Bones crack The Crawler’s history

Sarah yanks her pick free then notices Rios staring at her
stunned Sarah realises what she must look like

Then Sarah senses something close CLICKING

Sarah grabs Rios Pulls her down into the SLUDGE again - so
that they are almost submerged A Crawler comes into the
cave CLICKING It crouches at the edge of the cave

And shits into the sludge Adding to it

Rios watches repulsed realising what she’s neck-deep in
The Crawler finishes its shit Leaves the cave

Sarah helps Rios up Rios spits out a mouthful of sludge
Picks up her lost boot from beneath the dead Crawler Pours
glop out from it

They share grimaces it’s almost comically bad

Stunned Vaines turns back to Juno But she has gone Vaines
looks round panicking

Vaines looks back at the approaching Crawler But it has
slipped back into the dark

He flashes his flashlight around desperate to locate the
threat

From nowhere the Crawler HISSES in Vaines’ face Bares its
teeth

Juno drops from the ceiling onto the Crawler Buries her axe
into the side of the Crawler’s head levers its handle down
crunching the blade up through bone and brain

The Crawler splutters Dead

Juno pulls her axe out stands up Wipes the axe on her
thigh Vaines stares at her Stares at the dead creature

up like tree trunks

on the floor she quickly bends to look at it

She changes direction and moves off

Vaines moves after her jumpy alert to every shadow
Crawler CLICKS echo nearby Juno freezes

Juno closes her eyes The CLICKS come again Juno angles her
head listening sensing

She looks to a PASSAGE to her left Then towards another
PASSAGE on the right

Her eyes narrow She grabs Vaines Pulls him to a wall Puts
her pick to his neck

A CRAWLER appears from behind a trunk It CLICKS and senses

vVaines breathes erratically The approaching Crawler searches
the ‘forest’

Juno glares at Vaines to control his breath
The Crawler edges closer Searching the walls

It advances on Juno and Vaines CLICK in their faces Juno’s
like stone

Vaines is desperately tries to stead breath and stay still
sweat beading his upper lip

He edges his gun from its holster Juno shakes her head
Droplets of piss DRIP onto his boots

The crawler turns slowly towards him smells the air
CLICKING mouth millimetres from Vaines’ wide eyes

Juno strikes Bites deep into the crawler’s throat Rips and
spits out its larynx

The crawler drops dead

Vaines stares in shock at Juno’s blood-smeared mouth He
fights against retching

Juno raises a hand silencing him sensing MOVEMENT at the
far end of the forest

They freeze Listen

Stalagmites block Juno’s lines of sight

She edges forward cautiously Axe raised

The MOVEMENT comes again

Her nerves wound tight Juno works from “trunk” to “trunk”
She sweeps her light round Shifts to a new stalagmite
Vaines follows her terrified

Juno hears something SCRABBLE behind the stalagmite ahead

She raises her pick Psyches herself Creeps slowly round
Then spins out from behind the “trunk”

Launches the pick towards--

Nothing There’s nothing there

Glimpses movement behind her reflected in her pick She
spins Swings her pick just as another axe hurtles at Juno’s
own face

Sparks fly as the two axes INTERLOCK

Juno stares at Sarah as if she’s seen a ghost

Juno stares right back

For several seconds neither speak Sarah’s icy eyes meeting
Junos fiery gaze They stand gunslingers before the draw

prizefighters before the bell

Something in their faces stops Vaines stepping in

Releasing it like a tomahawk

Past Sarah’s shoulder

behind her

It falls DEAD

Juno barges past Sarah retrieves her weapon Looks around

her unimpressed

wrong Loses it through the floor His foot stuck fast he
struggles to get it out

Rios tries to pull him out Sarah and Juno come to help

As they tug the wrenching GROAN of a crack opening up

It’s no good The floor will give
way

pulls her arm away

Only to find that Vaines has cuffed her wrist to his

Sarah reaches for his keys They tussle
The crack widens

Then the ground buckles under his bodyweight cracking open
to reveal a deep vertical fissure in the rock

vaines tumbles into the sheer shaft held dangling from Sarah
by the cuffs pulling her over the ledge with him

to stop him falling

claw holds

Vaines back into the shaft pulling Sarah down wit him Rios
holds tight But they are all being pulled into the
precipice

The second crawler grabs at Vaines’s legs Gnawing at his
boots Tripling the weight SLUMP They all slip back
further

Vaines screams louder Blood bursts from his mouth

As Vaines is pulled backwards Sarah clings to a rock with
her free hand to anchor herself

SARAH
The keys

Realising he’s fucked Vaines fumbles for the keys
Finally gets them

But the first crawler BITES into his arm

He drops the keys They fall into the darkness

SARAH
Juno

Juno realises immediately what Sarah’s asking her to do

She glances at Vaines overrun by crawlers realising he’s
going to die

Juno raises her pick

SARAH
Juno Please

Juno has to lean down into the shaft to have a shot
It puts her directly in Vaines’s eyeline
He watches in horror as Juno aims the pick at his wrist

The collective weight shifts further back One more pull and
Sarah’s gone too

SARAH (CONTD)
Please

Juno slams the pick into Vaines’ wrist

Vaines SCREAMS hideously

Rios watches on in shock

But Juno hacks again And again Through skin sinew bone
gristle tendons There are eight bones and four joints in
the wrist It’s bloody grisly work

Again Vaines is pulled harder tendons strain rip Last
tendon Blood down him Crawler on throat-- pulling them
down Juno has one last shot

A final sinew stretches and snaps as

Vaines falls away

The crawlers fall with him

Disappearing down into the dark

Sarah hangs free

They hoist her up over the lip

Vaines’s severed hand dangles from her cuffs Disgusted
Sarah tries to shake it free It remains persistently in

place takes some effort to get it loose

They back away from the drop Sarah meets Juno’s eye Nods
something approximating thanks

RIOS
Which way

Juno points
JUNO
Wait There’s something I didn’t
tell you
EXT CRAWLER FEEDING CHAMBER - DARK

Sarah Juno and Rios peer round a corner in a TUNNEL peer
round the corner into

A wide domed chamber

An awful cacophony of raspy wet CHEWING

Wherever Rios aims her thermal imaging camera it reveals
heat blobs Dozens of heat blobs Each one a live crawler
hardly any floorspace between them tearing at their freshly

slaughtered prey- both animal and human

JUNO
It’s where they eat

Juno points to the far side of the chamber a tunnel wet with
blood from where slaughtered creatures have been brought

To get there they have to SWIM through the BLOODPOOL where
run-off blood collects that runs along the side of the
chamber

Rios shakes her head is Juno mad

Juno nods It’s the only way

Sarah and Juno hold a long look

INT CRAWLER FEEDING CHAMBER - DARK

The three of them slip into the blood pool

The stench is horrendous The sounds are worse disgusting
glimpses wet LIPSMACKS CHOMPING TEARING CHEWING

They wade through the poolslow claggy progress

They communicate with hands and heads Stop Go That way
A discarded bone SPLASHES between them A false alarm
They press on All too aware of their prospective fate

Finally they climb out of the blood pool dripping with
blood

They edge on towards the tunnel

Picking their way through discarded bones
One false foot will alert them all
Rios suddenly steps inches from Greg’s half-eaten head

Rios’s urge to gag intense PARASITES crawl out onto her
boot

She steels herself follows the others into the tunnel
INT SINKHOLE JUNCTION - MOMENTS LATER

Several feet in they reach a JUNCTION at the base of a
sinkhole Far far above a distant pinprick of LIGHT

A chimney-like structure formed by falling water its sheer
sides are round and smooth Feeling the smooth wall Sarah
talks at a whisper

SARAH
We can’t hammer in holds well
upset the neighbours

JUNO
Two people back to back

A beat Someone must be left below Sarah and Rios look at
each other at Juno not quite trusting her

JUNO
I couldn’t climb a tree

SARAH
Well drop a rope

JUNO
You better

Sarah and Rios back to back legs pressed on opposing walls
crab their way up the chimney

Every friction hold dislodges small stones and rock dust that
trickle down

Agonising moments for Juno at the bottom aware of the
eaters that might be alerted down the tunnel She sees hot
shapes shuffle in her thermal imaging

Rios’s untrained leg wobbles strains for a hold They
struggle to keep their shape Knocking a carabiner from
Sarah’s belt

It falls forever

Lands with a CLANG
Juno sees crawlers stir raises her pick
Then the crawlers thankfully return to their troughing

Finally Sarah and Rios reach a ledge halfway up From here
the chimney tapers such that one person can continue alone

SARAH
Keep climbing

Rios hesitates then presses on for the top

At the bottom Juno winces at every SCUFF of her boots every
falls of dislodged rock

Sarah throws a rope down tugs it tight for Juno

Juno starts her rope climb struggling with her injured leg
alert to every noise The metallic CLICK of every clasp The
CREAK of rope The JANGLE of metal buckles against rock

Juno hears crawler’s rustling Nervous

Sarah holds the rope taking Juno’s weight her muscles
burning her hands burning against taut rope

Junos injured leg buckles as she struggles to yank herself
up faster She loses her grip slips back to the bottom

Juno struggles to steady herself flailing for handholds on
the smooth rockface

SLAM Juno lands hard at the bottom- lets out a CRY She
grits her teeth against the pain

Too late Crawlers stop eating An eerie silence

Sarah can see two crawlers closing in on Juno below her
Juno swings her pick fending them off

Above her she can see Rios climbing towards the light
She could leave now and follow Rios

JUNO
Go Go after her

Sarah hesitates
Rios looks back alive to her dilemma

Two huge lead CRAWLERS pincer in on Juno

There’s no escape
Sarah drops down on a rope

She lands her boots on the first crawlers head slamming her
pick into the second huge crawler

Sarah faces Juno No time to talk A mother of a battle to
fight

Whilst Rios climbs Sarah and Juno hack at whatever comes at
them Chopping Cutting SmashingSide by side Sarah and
Juno slice scythe sever

A bloody blur of close-quarter combat Sarah and Juno barely
distinguishable from the Crawlers they fight

A Crawler lunges Sinks its teeth into Sarah’s arm
Juno buries her pick into the Crawler’s back The Crawler
releases it jaws to SCREECH in agony revealing its neck
Juno rams the axe right into the Crawler’s jugular

Juno takes an excruciating claw-wound to her injured leg

Sarah jumps in taking a heavy gut blow- crawler’s claws-
that was meant for Juno

Back to back Sarah and Juno dispatch the crawlers with a
barrage of blows

Finally there are none left Everything is dead

Juno and Sarah stand together at the centre of a bloody
circle

Turning they come face to face with one another A baptism
in blood

From all the tunnels CLICKS SCUTTLING
Juno picks up the thermal imaging camera Every way she

turns down every tunnel red spots crawlers closing
inHORDES OF THEM

JUNO
My leg’s fucked Go I’1l hold
them

SARAH

You wouldn’t last a minute

JUNO
I lasted two days

SARAH
I know

The crawlers close fast

Sarah coughs up blood presses the deadly gash on her torso
Juno understands the full extent of her injuries

A device on Sarah’s belt FLASHES red Dan’s gas detector

SARAH
Methane That stuff’1l kill you

Reading each other’s thoughts they somehow find smiles

Hearing the crawlers coming through the tunnels Sarah and
Juno turn to face them

Both wield picks Tired Fighters in the final round
Juno can barely walk Sarah’s little better her breathing
laboured dripping blood Together they stumble away from the

sinkhole towards the enemy into the darkness

JUNO
COMEONNNNNN

The Crawlers turn en masse Snarl and screech

Sarah and Juno slip into a side tunnel

INT SINKHOLE - DARKNESS

Rios climbs

Emotion shudders through her

But as Rios climbs higher and higher she grits her teeth
fixes her eyes on the light at the end of the TUNNEL
Onward upward toward the light

INT TUNNELS - DARKNESS

Crawlers HUNT

VOICES draw them deeper into the dark

They hunt it down Turn a corner find

THE CAMCORDER playingthe party scene all the girls from
the first filmlaughing and having funfriends

A false trail
A crawler sniffs the camcorder swipes it aside
The crawlers listen out for other noises

Hearing Rios GRUNTS and SCUFFLES as she climbs
With lethal speed they set out after her

INT SINKHOLE - DARKNESS

Rios makes for the light above

Below she hears the crawlers

Then she sees them

SARAH (0S)
THIS WAY YOU BLIND FUCKS

The crawlers turn away after

JUNO (0S)
COME TO MAMA

INT TUNNEL - DARKNESS
Dead-end Sarah and Juno huddle Two broken warriors

JUNO
Your belts still flashing

SARAH
It’s a fashion thing

It’s Dan’s gas detector on red alert for methane

JUNO
You got gas

SARAH
Something terrible You got a
light

INT SINKHOLE - DARKNESS
Rios climbs towards the light knowing the others are
INT DEAD END - DARKNESS
Juno pulls a zippo lighter
SARAH
That’s Hollys

(Juno nods)
This is yours

below

Sarah hands Juno the ‘love each day’ pendant Paul gave her
They interlock the pendant in their hands

They share a look A silent communion

JUNO
I’1l see you in hell

SARAH
Not if I see you first

The Crawlers inch closer Surround Sarah and Juno
Sarah flicks the lighter
The naked flame ignites the METHANE

A FIREBALL rolls through the cave swallowing and smiting
everything

Killing all CRAWLERS

Consuming the CAMCORDER all the girls in the cabin
laughing

INT SINKHOLE —- DARKNESS

With Crawler SCREECHES and smoke rising behind her Rios
climbs up toward the light

EXT MOUNTAIN SIDE —- DAY

Rios spills out into the surface Dawn is just breaking
Spectral light

Shes halfway up the mountain Deep in forest
She rolls over Overwhelmed Gulping air Practically crying

Then she sees a stag Running for its life from unseen
predators Blurred shapes chasing it through the trees

A familiar CLICKCLICK
Rios’s face suddenly tightens

RIOS
They hunt above ground

Rios looks around The nightmare’s not over

Rios hunkers down pulls out her mobile phone Dials 911
RIOS
This is Deputy Elen Rios I need
backup
Hearing a noise she turns back to the sinkhole

Peers back into the darkness

RIOS
Sarah Juno

Straining to see into the pitch black
Flashframe CRAWLER JAWS CLOSING IN
