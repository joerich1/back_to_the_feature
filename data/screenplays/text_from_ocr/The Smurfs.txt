EXT DEEP IN THE WOODS (LIVE ACTION) - DAY

PUSH IN SLOWLY through thick ferns mossy trees Peaceful
but like the calm before the storm Like a scene from
Jurassic Park Suddenly a LOW RUMBLE the sound of FEET
rushing Little feet Lots of them

A FLASH OF BLUE in the underbrush And another Then An
explosion of blue and white as a throng of blue GNOME-LIKE
creatures (SMURFS) explode into view frantically fleeing with
gazelle-like precision or like a school of land-going fish
(NOTE Smurfs will be CGI in a live-action world throughout)

As they whip past camera a beast explodes from the bushes
leaping directly toward the SCREEN claws and fangs bared
It’s a huge mangy HOUSE CAT -- terrifying from a Smurf’s POV

At the head of the Smurfs is a sweet dopey but terrified
looking fellow This is CLUMSY We rocket into a CU of his
face and FREEZE FRAME

SUPER “ONE HOUR EARLIER”

DISSOLVE TO
EXT DEEP IN THE WOODS - SMURF VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING SHOT
Mushroom cottages abound beneath a banner that reads Festival
of the Blue Moon” for which SMURFS cook build and decorate
Several FLY into the tiny UTOPIA on a tame STORK

ANGLE ON Vanity and SMURFETTE leading a group of SMURFS in a
comical dance rehearsal to the beat of native DRUMS

VANITY
Five six seven eight

SMURFETTE
That’s it Clumsy feel the rhythm
Good job Hefty Almost lunch time
Greedy hang in there

Brainy supervises decorations nearby but can’t resist
interjecting

BRAINY
No no no You call that dancing

VANITY
I told you it was too complicated
THE SMURFS - Stem and Weiss - 61609 2

BRAINY
I’m sorry What part of “step-ball-
change pas de beurre jazz hands” is
so hard to understand

The stare at him blankly

HEFTY
The whole thing
CLUMSY
We could do the hokey pokey
BRAINY
Look who’s talking it’s the dancing

bear
Brainy does an comic impression of Clumsy’s dancing

VANITY
He’s doing the best he can with
what little he has

CLUMSY
Thank you I think

BRAINY
(to Greedy )
And you Every time you turn it’s
like watching jelly jiggle And
don’t get me started on this guy

He turns to Gutsy a tough-looking Smurf in a kilt who stares
him down

GUTSY
(in thick Scottish brogue)
Watch wat ya say lad or youll be
wearing yer lips like a scarf

BRAINY
Because he’s doing fine

LAZY
All this dancing’s making me tired

Lazy YAWNS and falls face-first into the dirt asleep

BRAINY
People please Tonight’s the Blue
Moon A magical time where wishes
are granted the smurfberry crop is
blessed and anything is possible
(MORE )
THE SMURFS - Stem and Weiss - 61609 3

BRAINY (CONTD)
Anything except getting you people
to dance right Now from the top

On Brainy’s CUE the SMURF ORCHESTRA launches into SONG 1 --
a celebration of the powers of the Blue Moon CRAZY who can
make virtually any noise with his mouth takes vocals as the
others break out in an insane Busby-Berkely dance number

SMURFETTE AND SMURFS (SINGING)
La la la-la-la-la la la la la la

With Smurfette front and center the otherwise all-male dance
troupe can’t keep their eyes off of her Many are injured

In the end Clumsy trips setting off a chain reaction of
falling Smurfs and knocking a ladder and paint onto Brainy

END SONGDANCE SEQUENCE
INT PAPA SMURF’S MUSHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

PAPA the oldest and wisest of Smurfs (set apart by his beard
and RED pants and hat) HUMS as he works on a potion A great
sorcerer Papa’s LAB is packed with alchemy books and gear

PAPA
(squinting tired)
Six milkworm hairs and precisely
one drop of starweed nectar

CLUMSY (0OS)
Papa Smurf Papa Smurf

Papa pours one drop then WHAM The door flies open and
Clumsy rushes in Startled Papa drops in the whole bottle
and the potion explodes

PAPA
(swallowing his temper)
Yeeees Clumsy What is it

CLUMSY
Brainy sent me to see if you need any
help getting ready for the festival

PAPA
He sent you here I thought you were
dancing

CLUMSY

He said my dancing was so good I
should take a break so he doesn’t
pull his hair out in happiness
THE SMURFS - Stem and Weiss - 61609 4

Smurfette appears in the doorway

PAPA
Let me guess another helper

SMURFETTE
Or else Brainy said I have to dance
in a burka What is a burka

PAPA
Very well why don’t you two go pick
Smurfberries while I gather more
starweed for our wishing potion

SMURFETTE
Papa we have barrels of berries

CLUMSY
Can I get the starweed Papa
Please It’s my fault you ran out

SMURFETTE
I could go with him

PAPA
No no The starweed grows too close
to Gargamel’s castle It’s far too
dangerous for young Smurfs

CLUMSY
But I’m brave If danger comes I’1l
just freeze like you taught us

Striking an absurd “blending” in pose Clumsy hits a pile of
ancient books which buries him He leaps back up

CLUMSY (CONTD)
I’m o-kay

PAPA
Smurfnabit Clumsy
(catching himself)
I mean I’1ll just get the starweed
myself this time Why don’t you too
run along and help set the table

CLUMSY
Oh Sure Papa Smurf Sorry

Clumsy sadly exits Papa begins cleaning Smurfette watches
him concerned

From OS

PAPA
What Don’t smurf around the bush
Smurfette You have that look

SMURFETTE
When are you going to realize we’re
not Smurflings anymore Papa The
boys are one-hundred and four

PAPA
Mere toddlers my dear A Papa’s
work is never done

SMURFETTE
Well it might be if you let us help
you a little more I worry about you
-- always working so hard

PAPA
(fixing her hair)
Ahhh my sweet little Smurfette

SMURFETTE
I mean it Papa You’ve raised us
really well It’s time you trust us
with more responsibility and take
better care of yourself for a change

comes the CACOPHONY of the rehearsal chaos

PAPA
You were saying Come let’s quiet
them down before the whole world
knows were here

As Smurfette rolls her eyes and follows him out

More LAUGHTER Furious Gargamel throws back his hood to
reveal the face of a brilliant but hapless madman

GARGAMEL (HOODED FIGURE)
Youll rue the day you laughed at the
great and soon to be exceedingly
powerful Gargamel

Hurling a vial to the floor POOF Gargamel vanishes in a
PLUME of smoke The crowed O0000s in awe Suddenly the
scroll is YANKED from Tony’s hand and begins beating him

People rush from the fire Gargamel staggers out with Azrael

GARGAMEL
Cursed invisibility spell Making a
mockery of me But with this we
shall never be mocked again
(reveals scroll segment)
Feast your eyes Azrael Feast

They stare absurdly at the scroll segment for a beat
“feasting” Clearly it bears greater import than Tony knew

GARGAMEL (CONTD)
This will lead us to the Smurfs And
when we extract the essence of those
wretched beasts pure unfailing
unimaginable power will be ours And
these fools will worship us like gods

A FAIRE GOER among MANY taking lessons at “BILL TELL’S”

sack with the flowers for Papa berry then another

Nearby a few more BLUE HANDS suddenly pick a branch clean

CLUMSY
We’re too young to pick starweed

The would-be wizard HUMS while methodically smoothing his new
blue scroll segment on the table of his ramshackle lab He
then produces an horrifying implement of torture and
smashes his piggy bank with it Azrael is aghast From the
shards he pulls the other half of blue scroll He breaks
into a fit of egomaniacal laughter Azrael joins him

GARGAMEL
(stops abruptly)
Now you’re just milking it

Gargamel smooths the pieces together and the pages MAGICALLY

Flees through the woods at top speed

CLUMSY
He’s coming He’s coming

Up ahead a troop of other SMURFS stop picking smurfberries
and look up to see Clumsy with Azrael is not far behind
Clumsy charges through the group and they instantanly follow
FREEZE FRAME On Clumsy’s terrified face

SUPER “THIS IS WHERE YOU CAME IN”

Sure enough not far behind Azrael Gargamel comes into view
reading his magic scroll In the panic Clumsy and the others
leap off SMURF DAM onto log rafts SHOOTING THE RAPIDS full
speed

MEANWHILE
EXT SMURF VILLAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Papa dutifully “enjoys” as Brainy conducts HARMONY Crazy and
the SMURF ORCHESTRA to a comically bumpy finale

PAPA
And then after the music I will
smurf the wishing potion into the
well and we’ll all hold our wishes
deep in our hearts Now remember
only the Smurf with the purest most
gentle heart will have his wish
granted

CLUMSY (0S)
Aaaaaaaaagh

Clumsy and the others roar into the village on the rafts
leaping and falling to shore

CLUMSY (CONTD)
Papa Smurf Papa Smurf

PAPA
Not now Clumsy
(to the others)
Then well all gaze up at the rising
of the glorious Blue Moon and say
AHHHH

The Smurfs look up as Gargamel’s huge head looms into view

GARGAMEL
(starting the famous song)
BLuuUE MOoooN YOU SAW ME STANDING
ALONE-—
(re Azrael’s PROTEST)
Alright so I brought my cat

Crazy begins making an ALARM SOUND as Smurfs SCREAM and
scatter Azrael charges Gargamel is right behind

Papa sprints past Clumsy

Papa Smurf Gargamel’s coming

PAPA
I noticed Run

GARGAMEL
Oh you can run But I’1ll tan your
hide

Papa and Clumsy dash for a mushroom cottage But Gargamel
obliterates it with his foot The force of the STOMP sends
Papa and Clumsy FLYING in opposite directions

In the melee Papa smashes open what looks like a glass case
where a fire hose would be But instead of a hose it
contains a leather pouch with an emergency stash of
smurfberrires

PAPA
(to pouch)
Old friend I hoped it would never
come to this
EXT NEARBY WOODS - SUNDOWN - MOMENTS LATER

Like thundering buffalo the Smurfs roar for a narrow ravine

PAPA
Smurfentine Smurfentine

Darting as a persicion herd the Smurfs dodge Azareal and
enter the ravine passing a sign FORBIDDEN GROTTOS-KEEP OUT

SMURFETTE
Forbidden Grottos The last Smurf
to go in here was never seen again

BRAINY
(hurrying past her)
Then don’t be last

They pass more signs Agony Ahead Perhaps Death Then
More Agony I Mean It Especially in a Blue Moon

EXT FORBIDDEN GROTTOS - TWILIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The Smurfs stumble into a lush green dead end Walled by
steep rock a baby stream flows from a pond at the base of a
smurf-sized WATERFALL

SMURFETTE
It’s a dead end There’s nowhere to
hide
THE SMURFS - Stem and Weiss - 61609 12

CLUMSY
(forgetting their danger)
Hey look The Blue Moon

Peeking through trees a huge BLUE MOON edges over the ravine
As its rays hit the pond Clumsy doesn’t see the little falls
begin to magically SHIMMER behind him

PAPA
Clumsy no

He reaches for Clumsy’s wrist just as THHHHHP Clumsy flails
backwards sucked INTO THE MAGICAL FALLS enveloped in a
RAINBOW of ENERGY He disappears through the once solid rock
wall behind the falls Papa’s pulled in too Followed by one
Smurf after another as they grab to save one another

Gargamel bursts onto the scene only to find they’re gone
GARGAMEL
Cowards Come out and fight like
men Albeit very small decidedly
blue men but still--

Suddenly his face LIGHTS UP as he sees the SHIMMERING falls
enveloped in a RAINBOW of ENERGY

WHITE OUT

CLOSE ON another falls in a similar grotto The walls behind
the falls CRACKLE with ELECTRICITY then Whoosh Out comes
Papa followed by a chain of SCREAMING Smurfs They land ina
churning pool just beneath the falls
UNDERWATER Smurfs frantically swim to the surface

As Hefty pulls comrades ashore -- Whoosh -- another CRACKLE of
ENERGY and Gargamels hand reaches from the falls

PAPA
Look out

Gargamel’s arm flails in search of Smurfs Jokey pulls his
floating GIFT BOX from the pool

JOKEY
Here you go Have a present

He shoves the box into Gargamel’s huge hand which promptly
disappears back through the falls

JOKEY (CONTD)
Wait for it

WARBLEY DISTANT SOUND FX KABOOM Followed by an ANGRY YOWL
But before the Smurfs can fully ENJOY Jokey’s work

HEFTY

Sweet mother of Smurf

The Smurfs follow Romeo’s gaze to

SMURFS’S POV Just downstream another “faire” is in progress
But unlike the quaint medieval affair of the opening this is
a FULLY MODERN TRADE SHOW of TODAY with trucks advertising
generators rides and ROCK and ROLL

PAPA
Wherever we are we’ve got to gather
the others and find Clumsy before the
Blue Moon ends or well never get
home Cmon

Papa and others race after the smurfs being swept downstream

In classic European style woods and lawns flourish near City
Centre TOURISTS stroll the booths of a TRADE SHOW VENDORS
show everything from hybrid cars to hi-tech health gear

BOOM DOWN from a Int’l Retailers Faire Banner to find Clumsy
wet and afaid under a bench staring up at a black monolith

CLUMSY’S POV Tilt up to reveal a statue of a Smurf The
plaque reads “Le Grand Schtroumpf par Peyo”

Hearing LAUGHTER he turns to a large colorful MUSHROOM that
looms ahead looking somewhat like a Smurf Cottage We
recognize it as a MOONBOUNCE

CLUMSY

As Clumsy approaches WHOOSH He’s SUCKED AGAINST the
moonbounce intake grill The blower begins to WHEEZE

Sticks and cans land all around a terrified Clumsy as he
struggles to catch his breath and scramble away

He quickly darts under the flap of a NEARBY TENT
EXT FORBIDDEN GROTTOS - NIGHT

Gargamel stumbles about in the pond hoisting a log like a
BATTERING RAM His clothes are a bit more tattered and his
face is blackened by Jokey’s recent explosion

GARGAMEL
Hold on to your catnips Azrael

And with that he charges the tiny falls with the log
INT SOUVENIR TENT - AFTERNOON

Looking to hide Clumsy scrambles past the shoes of PATRICK
WINSLOW (30s) a handsome harried American marketer for a
cosmetics powerhouse As Patrick takes notes on a rival’s
products his phone RINGS

INTERCUT WITH
EXT GRASSY CURBSIDE PARKWAY - MANHATTAN - AM SAME

Patrick’s daughter SOPHIE is on her mother’s cell phone
pacing blithely with the family’s trusty BEAGLE TARZAN who
wears a protective lamp-shade collar

SOPHIE
Hi Daddy I miss you so much Do

PATRICK
Of course princess Like crazy

SOPHIE
Mom said you’re worried about money
so you might not bring us any
presents Is that for real

PATRICK
(can’t bear to hurt her)
No baby In fact I already picked
you out something special

Patrick glances about for a way to make this true Among the
toys he glimpses a small blue figure FROZEN in a familiar
blending-in pose As he crosses to it a BELL BLARES from the
SCHOOL behind Sophie Tarzan YOWLS

THE SMURFS - Stem and Weiss - 61609 15

SOPHIE
It’s okay Tarzan Tarzan shhhh

PATRICK
Where are you Sophie

Patrick picks up Clumsy and inspects him

SOPHIE (0S)
At Sammy’s school

PATRICK

SOPHIE
(nonchalant)
Yeah Sammy got in trouble for flying
his helicopter at the pep rally so
mom had to pick him and we were at
the vet cause Tarzan’s teeth hurt

PATRICK

Oh

Just then Patrick’s beautiful frazzled wife (GRACIE) exits
the school trying to quiet a teething baby (REINA) Son SAM is right behind carrying a broken remote control
helicopter

SOPHIE
Mom Daddy wants to talk to you

SAM
(putting in earphones)
It wasn’t my fault

Sam rolls his eyes then gets distracted by a cute girl going
inside Gracie pulls him back to reality and toward the car

PATRICK
Ooookay And the dog What’s that
gonna to set us back

GRACIE
(re dog’s cone wincing)
Seven-hundred and fifty dollars

Patrick’s heart skips a beat as he sets his impromptu gift
selections at the register Gracie reluctantly continues

GRACIE (CONTD)

Oh and don’t write any checks for a
little bit I had to put down
1500 on Sophie’s braces

Sophie flashes a bracey smile Patrick sheepishly removes
some gifts from the counter The PROPRIETOR is not impressed

GRACIE (CONTD)
Did you talk to Odile about
travelling less

Patrick watches the proprietor scan Clumsy whose eyes go
cross-eyed as the laser hits him again and again

PATRICK
Not yet but I will

GRACIE
Serious honey This family needs
you The kids miss you I miss you

PATRICK
I’ll talk to her I promise

As Gracie wrestles Reina into the car the phone slips from
her ear She yells at it on the floorboard

ANGLE ON Clumsy now partially free of the box
ducks back inside as something 0S fills him with dread

Suddenly he

GARGAMEL and Azrael pass by taking in the strange new world

GARGAMEL
What manner of freakish realm is
this Azrael Yet even here the
stench of Smurfs gives me goosebumps

ON GARGAMEL he spots a tall attractive NORDIC WOMAN

WHAP She decks him and marches off

Papa and the Smurfs tiptoe like Navy Seals through a maze of
cables and support gear Suddenly Papa flashes a “hold up”
sign The Smurfs stop bumping each other in chain reaction

PAPA
Alright everyone think like Clumsy

The Smurfs immediately adopt blank or dopey stares A few
just plain fall down Papa just shakes his head

CLUMSY (0OS)

lowers a devastated Clumsy into the trunk

Gargamel charges but the Taxi pulls away leaving him GASPING
for breath directly over the crestfallen Smurfs

His internal senses atingle Gargamel looks down to see Gutsy
and the others at his feet

SMURFS

Yahhh

Azrael gives a WAR CRY Master and cat charge their prey

A free-for-all as Gargamel and Azrael chase Smurfs through

Oooouch

With Gargamel bearing down Gutsy and Hefty help Papa as they
charge after the others INTO THE CASTLE

GUTSY
Lower the gate

The chocolate gate wheel breaks off Greedy takes a bite

GREEDY

Suddenly their world goes BLACK as a cargo lid is lowered
onto the castle WHAM Gargamel face-plants against the crate

A FEDEX GUY secures the lid while his PARTNER labels it with
the tape gun The container is hoisted Gargamel leaps for it
THE SMURFS - Stem and Weiss - 61609 21

there overnight

The worker exits Gargamel examines the shred of label and
tape It features Patric’s Company LOGO “LAURENT” and “USA”
Gargamel calls to a PASSERBY

GARGAMEL
You knave Pray tell where is the
“Usa of these sacred writings

sets him running in place in pool of slippy soap

Reaching for support Clumsy yanks the plug and all is QUIET

under the arms and a GARGLE Ahh refreshing To climb out
he grabs the handle FLUSH

be in Paris twice a month

doesn’t even know about Paris yet
I don’t know how to tell her It’s
gonna break her heart

Papa graciously sets his own worries aside with a SIGH

PAPA
Well There’s no use keeping
secrets my friend You’ll just wind
up alone

out and tell her

I often find with my little Smurfs
the truth gently coated with tender
care is easier to hear Do
something meaningful for her Then
share Then duck

C’mon guys I’m sure we’ll find ‘em
(off their glares)
Look I’m really sorry alright I
didn’t know who that guy was I did
the best I could So don’t look at
me with those big sad--

WAAAA They break into more inconsolable comic tears
Smurfette leads Patrick away from the bunch and hops up on a
table to speak with him

SMURFETTE
They don’t blame you They’re just
scared They miss their Papa
Remember how it felt when you were
little and your papa would leave

PATRICK
(beat)
Actually no My dad passed away
before I really knew him
THE SMURFS - Stem and Weiss - 61609 88

SMURFETTE
Oh Gosh No Papa You poor thing

PATRICK
No it’s not like that it’s fine
(beat off her puzzlement)
Okay so it was a little hard My
mom had to work two jobs to keep food
on the table and I barely saw her
But you know you adjust You get by

Smurfette gazes up aching for him her big eyes moistening
Patrick pauses his own bullshit failing to comfort even him

He glances away to the mantle A FAMILY PORTRAIT of him
Gracie and the kids in happier more carefree times In the
PARK barefoot Patrick spins Sam in the air while his new
daughter giggles in her mother’s arms

PATRICK (CONTD)

What am I doing What’s wrong with
me I’m about to throw everything
that matters to me away and for
what

SMURFETTE
You’re scared

PATRICK
I’m terrified It’s like I have to
keep running faster and faster just
to keep up And if I ever stop I
don’t know We’1ll end up living in
a box somewhere

SMURFETTE
(beat)
Well we live in mushrooms And
because we have each other it’s

really nice

Patrick smiles warming to the notion of maybe letting go
just a little Suddenly

WHAM A SEAGULL smashes into the window behind him Another
huge GULL SMASHES through the glass Pulling ivy vine reins
Hefty forces his bird into an emergency landing on the table
Clumsy clings to his neck

CLUMSY

Sophie scoops Clumsy into her arms He smiles weakly as Gutsy
wrangles his bird into the room

SMURFETTE

Patrick grabs Crazy and squeezes him causing a shrill FOG
HORN then an AH-UUUGAH followed by a submarine DIVE BELL
THE SMURFS - Stem and Weiss - 61609 90

PATRICK
Guys Come on a little respect

Dozens of blinking frightful eyes turn to Brainy

BRAINY
It’s true I always wanted to be in
charge of you know a festival or
what color we paint the barn but
not like this

Brainy peers into the bag with the Blue Moon spell

BRAINY (CONTD)
Mr Winslow seeing as were one smurf
short of a papa we could sure use
your help

PATRICK
I I don’t know anything about blue
moons or how to make a spell

BRAINY
I don’t mean that I’m talking about
going after our Papa

Amazed looks from the others

FRIGHTENED SMURF
But Papa said to get us home

BRAINY
Papa says Papa always says
something But I’m in charge now
And I say No Smurf left behind

HEFTY
(beat)
Brainy Gargamel’s got a magic
scepter now It spits blue fire and
makes him more powerful than ever

GUTSY
An’ we doon even knooow where he is
We’d need a bloodhound to find ‘em
A rrreal blue blood

All eyes turn to Tarzan He looks confused then sniffs his
own rear runs in circles after his tail and falls over
Nope The Smurfs slump in despair

PATRICK
(rising)
Wait You don’t need a blueblood

outside the car with the kids cradling a cup of coffee

SAM
Are you sure this is where he said

SOPHIE
Yeah he just said be here and be
ready for anything

SAM
He probably just wants to say goodbye
before he heads to the airport

Just then Patrick comes into view in a heroes entrance with
several dozen Smurfs crossing a nearby foodbridge They’re
geared for battle Patrick carries Sam’s helicopter

GRACIE

ON THE GROUND Several straggling Smurfs wrestle comically to
get themselves into their balloons for inflating by Sam

IN THE AIRBORNE BALLOONS Smurfs “run” furiously to
spinguide the balloons toward Belvedere They are AMAZED by
the view as they float over the park

ANGLE ON wee-hour NEW YORKERS enjoy the runaway balloons

Gargamel and Azrael dance around the essence factory in
macabre glee as the glop of Papa’s beard gurgles through in an
ominous test of what’s to come for the Smurfs

Gargamel holds the dragon handle of his scepter to the spigot
filling its mouth with smurf-blue ESSENCE The eyes glow
REDDER as more BLUE ENERGY engulfs the sheath

through the undergrowth all around him

its glow distinctively BLUE The Winslows’ jaws drop

HEFTY
Look

The pond waters being to roil As in the Forbidden Grottos a
glistening rock formation rises up A SHIMMERING PORTAL
blazes behind the falling waters A rocky path emerges
leading to shore

Suddenly a horse-drawn carriage charges up in the distance

GARGAMEL
Ya YAAAAAA

PAPA
Go Gol

Lesser known Smurfs charge across the watery path and dive
through the portal with hardly time to wave goodbye

The carriage bears down with terrifying speed with Gargamel
standing beside Azrael whipping the horses like Ben Hur
Panicked smurfs cross into the portal as fast as they can

Gargamel aims his scepter ZAP A bolt of blue energy
OBLITERATES THE PORTAL trapping Papa and half the smurfs in
our world while the other half are trapped in theirs

Gargamel aims again this time directly at Papa and the
remaining Smurfs As they SCREAM and scramble for cover we
hear the familiar whir of SPUTTERING ROTORS

Papa looks up at the moon as the fog clears away It’s
clearly no longer blue

PAPA
I don’t know I really don’t know

Hey Look

An inky BLUE spreads from where the wand went in The
reflection of the moon is also blue but the real moon is
still only white

surface of the pond dancing on the reflection of the moon
Then it rises up toward the Moon itself

GUTSY
Grrreat Smurf

Everyone looks up to see the Moon actually turning BLUE
Clumsy’s eyes open as the color begins to return to his hand
then spreads to his whole body

PAPA
Great Smurf indeed Clumsy Youve

Clumsy sits up renewed as the portal begins to rise from the
water again The Smurfs stare in awe as the rocky path re-
emerges to bear them home

QUICK SHOTS ALL OVER NEW YORK NIGHT-LIFERS and WILDLIFE stop
to gaze up in amazement at the BLUE MOON

IN THE PARK Smurfs eagerly line up to walk the shimmering
stone path to the portal where Brainy directs them through
Each returns to their deep blue as they dive in

BRAINY
Come along everyone No telling how
long the spell will last

Hefty approaches the portal then turns and waves to the
Winslows

HEFTY
Good bye We’1ll never forget you

hand WHOOSH He’s sucked through before he knows what
happened A line of others wave goodbye and follow
