INT BAR- THE ISLAND OF IBIZA SPAIN - NIGHT

We are in a cool pick up bar on the island of Ibiza off the
coast of Spain It is considered by many to be the club capitol
of the world HOT SINGLES mix in the bar Guys try out lines on
BEAUTIFUL WOMEN They speak in SPANISH we sees the SUBTITLES

SPANISH GUY 1
--I am tired of these one night
stands what I am-really looking
for is ‘a relationship

SPANISH GUY 2
»e-Tlike cuddling puppies long
walks on the beach and you

“ SPANISH GUY 3
«-Maybe wecould go someplace and
just ‘hold each other and talk

‘SPANISH GUY 4

«--I want to listen to you
Finally we end on two AMERICANS playing pool Tall smart
good looking and charming this is JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY
“FOSTER Everyone calls h JEK And JAMES “KENTUCKY” HANSEN
Everyone calls him Tuck He is fun freewheeling and reckless
-- a big kid who never grew up

JFK is dressed in a tux and he looks ‘good Tuck is dressed in
a three piece suit shirt tie and suit all of some strange
pattern that looks like it belongs on wallpaper orcarpet It
ooks a little odd but he makes it work

They eye TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRLS at the bar who have been hit on
and rebuffed every guy there Tuck smiles broadly at them

JFK
Hola hablo anglais

BEAUTIFUL GIRL

Yes we speak English

gPK
Good because we’re actually much
More charming in our own language

BEAUTIFUL GIRL
laughs then)
What is up with your suit

TUCK
See it’s a conversation starter He
didn’t want me to where it

JPK
I’ll say this as respectfully as I can
and it’s nothing personal -- we’d tell
you but then we’d have to kill you I
know people always say that but we
really would have to and that
§checking them out)
would be a damn shame

BEAUTIFUL GIRL 2
(laughs)
So what are you doing in Madrid
Business or pleasure

JFK
Business

BEAUTIFUL GIRL
What is your business

TUCK
(leans in and whispers)
Were spies Spooks secret agents
undercover operatives whatever you want
to call us We’re here on a mission

BEAUTIFUL GIRL
Oh yeah you guys work for the CIA

JFK
CbO actually the Covert Defense
Organization

BEAUTIFUL GIRL
Never heard of it

JFK
See they do a good job

TUCK
(winks at her)
It‘s top secret He’s the planner
and I’m well the muscle

JFK
Like you do everything We’re both the
muscle

(MORE)
The Women

They turn

Tuck nods

JFK (contd)
i would just personally prefer not to
have to get into a fight in the first
place Myself Id rather be on a plane
three continents and ten hours away
enjoying a nice glass of the finest wine
our domestic airlines have to offer and
eating a bad in-flight meal while
watching an even worse in-flight movie
when the shit for the lack of a better
word goes down

TUCK
Whereas I would rather be right there --
three inches from the guys face when we
take him down Call me an adrenaline
junkie

JFK
You are an adrenaline junkie

TUCK
Iam I really am There’s this little
noise a bad guy makes when you snap their
neck Big or small it’s all the same It’s
this little squeal just like a little girl

(He makes the noise)

I love it It’s the sound of a job well
done and a safe nation I like to be
there for that

just stare at them

BEAUTIFUL GIRL
That by far is the worst pick up I
have ever heard

and walk away The Guys watch after them

TUCK
No one ever believes us

JFK
They never do
looks at the time
You ready to do this

They finish their drinks and turn to walk out

JFK
By the way the whole “loving the little
noise that a bad guy makes when you snap
his neck” thing In the future you might
want to just keep that one to yourself I
think that’s really more of an inside
voice thought that doesn’t really need to
be shared with others
Tuck smiles and they head out into the streets of IBIZA We
HEAR music thumping BEAUTIFUL WOMEN YOUNG PEOPLE abound

EXT CLIFF ROAD -— NIGHT
A beautiful very well guarded house on the cliff

WELL DRESSED PEOPLE in nice cars move towards the gated
house It is obvious some sort of party is going on

A COUPLE stands smoking on the side of the road outside the
gates JFK and Tuck walk towards them Tuck loudly tells a
joke in Spanish

TUCK
(subtitled)
---And then the Priest said to the
firefighter I don’t even own a chicken

JFK laughs really hard like he can’t breath They reach the
couple and each emits a SPRAY OUT OF THEIR CUFF LINKS GASSING
THEM The couple pass out Tuck and JFK catch them and drag
them into the bushes

JFK rifles through their clothes until he finds barcoded
invites to the party He slips them in his jacket pocket
Tuck puts in an earpiece They nod at one another JFK then
heads towards the house Tuck heads around the gates

EXT GATES NIGHT

Armed GUARDS scan the barcoded invites JFK hands them his
and smiles broadly They scan it and smile awkwardly back at
him He hands them his Treo and passes through security

INT HOUSE -— NIGHT

JFK enters the party BEAUTIFUL PARTYGOERS dance mingle A
SPANISH FLAMENCO BAND plays He takes one of the buttons off
his shirt and places it in his ear (His comms)

JFK grabs a drink off a tray He surveys the place There are
a bunch of BIG GUYS in suits with ear pieces JFK makes note
of them He moves through the room eating hour d oeuvres off
trays and looking for security cameras

He sees one in the corner goes and stands under it He pulls
his TREO out and holds it up like he’s looking for a signal
Then when no one is looking he hits a button The ANTENNA
SHOOTS UPWARDS PIERCING INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE CAMERA

Whistling JFK taps some keys on the Treo which now show him
footage of all of the house’s security cameras

INT SECURITY OFFICE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

TWO GUARDS watch TV’s which show them different positions on
the house and the grounds All of a sudden all the screens
switch to an episode of the SIMPSONS dubbed into Spanish
They look at each other not knowing what is happening

EXT GROUNDS CONTINUOUS

Tuck fixes the harpoon into the lock on the door We see an
ELECTRICAL CHARGE AS IT SHORTS THE ALARM and then ACID FROM
THE TIP EATS THROUGH THE LOCK Tuck now charges towards it

JFK (OVER COMMS)
You got forty five seconds

Tuck rams into the gate the door flies open INTERCUT
BETWEEN JFK TUCK AND THE SECURITY OFFICE

-JFK watches the cameras on the Treo

JFK
You are all clear into the house

-Tuck runs through the dark backyard towards the house He
loads another dart into the gun

He aims it towards a back door He looks through the
electronic site at the lock as he runs Tuck FIRES The dart
hits square into the lock SPARK DRIP BURN Tuck now
charges through this door

JFK smiles knowingly at the people They smile back and move on

JFK

Ten seconds

covering his face and neck in the same pattern as the suit

-The Security Guards pick up a phone and are about to call
-Tuck charges down a hallway

JFK
Five four three two

Tuck rounds a corner and dives up against a wall We now see
why he was wearing that suit It IS THE EXACT SAME PATTERN AS
THIS WALLPAPER And in the low light he blends right in

In the Security Room we see all the monitors go back to
normal They look at each other then sit down relieved The
camera pans past Tuck not noticing him against the wall

-JFK watches on his Treo

oFK ‘
All right let me know when you have
it I’m gonna find Le Monde and plant
the tracking device

-A GUARD passes The security camera does as well After
which Tuck peels off the wall and heads in the other
direction down the hallway INTERCUT BETWEEN HE AND JFK

TUCK
Copy that I’m heading to his office

He looks around at the place as he moves searching
Expensive art adorns the walls
TU
(into his comms)
This is a really nice house

Below JFK moves through the party looking for their host

JFK
Being an international arms dealer
does have its perks

TUCK
Think if we became arms dealers we could
get a nice house like this

JFK
Yeah I do If I run into him I’1ll be sure
to ask how one gets into the business

TUCK
Maybe he could write us a
recommendation

Tuck reaches a door He checks his map of the house

TUCK
I’m here

Tuck goes to work on the lock JFK looks at the Treo He sees G
a GUARD about to round the corner
JFK

Guard

Tuck throws himself back against the wall As he does he hits
his ear where he has his comm The Guard walks down the hall
He passes and Tuck goes back to work on the door

TUCK
I’m heading in

JFK
Copy that

Tuck enters but while JFK heard him we see that Tuck didn’t
hear him back His comm is out although he doesn’t know it

INT LE MONDE’S OFFICE - CONTINUING

INT HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUING

JFK walks through the crowd In the center of the room he
sees the host JAVIER LE MONDE half Spanish half French
forties A very successful legitimate businessman
international arms dealer anda really bad guy

Outof JFK’s pocket he slips a miniscule tracking device He
places it on his finger and starts walking towards Le Monde
When he sees some guards moving They start to head upstairs

JFK (OVER COMMS)
Tuck
INT LE MONDE’S OFFICE

Tuck sits at the desk He can’t hear JFK He scans the list
of most typed words Most are the usual common ones One
however stands out ROSEBUD Tuck smiles and enters it On
screen appears Le Monde’s whole financial network

TUCK
Let’s make some withdrawals

As Tuck goes to work
INT HOUSE — PARTY

JFK looks at his Treo He sees Guards heading upstairs in the
direction of the room Tuck is in

JFK
Tuck you are about to have some very
unwanted visitors Get out now

Nothing JFK thinks He can’t get up there to intercept them
And he is supposed to just walk awaybut this is his best
friend He can’t He hits a few buttons on the Treo and goes
and sticks it against the wall behind him He then takes a
deep breath grabs a glass and starts banging on it

JFK
Excuse me Excuse me I am sorry to
interrupt I just wanted to give a little
teast and say a few words about our
esteemed host Javier Le Monde

People APPLAUD The Guards stop on the stairs and look

JFK
Yes yes do applaud He deserves it
Let’s hear some good ones
(People clap laugh)
(MORE)
JFK (contd)
Our host is known for many things his
successful businesses his charitable
work but I want to talk about something
he doesn’t speak about a lot

Le Monde watches him carefully He turns to his AIDE

LE MONDE
Who is this

The Aide shakes his head

JFK
Which is his unsung work as an
international arms dealer selling arms to
terrorist groups and rogue nations

The Crowd murmurs uncomfortably The Guards turn and start to
head back downstairs

OPK
He doesn’t talk about it much this gay -“SO
modest But he should not sell himself
short It is not easy being a illicit arms
dealer these days

People start to leave Guards head towards JFK

JFK
All those people countries out to get
you All those pesky watch listslaws you
have to break Some of you may or may not
know this but dealing arms is illegal in
most places in fact it is way illegal
which makes the work he does even harder

Guards talk into their comms More start to appear as even
more guests leave

JFK
So let’s raise our glasses to Javier
Without you what would the terrorists do

JFK looks around no one is with him Most everyone is gone or
heading for the exits

JFK
No No one Jihad anyone

Javier is not amused Even the Flamenco Band has packed up
and is walking out JFK turns to them
JFK
You guys were really good I‘d get a
card but-

They are gone JFK looks at Javier It is just him JFK and a
whole multitude of unamused Guards They stare at each other

LE MONDE

That was very rude
JFK

Thank you I try
LE MONDE

Who are you Who do you work for
JFK

(thinks)

Nah I don’t think I’m going to tell you

LE MONDE
Don’t worry We’ll find out

And with that Le Monde’s Guards start to move towards him
JFK holds up the stylus from his Treo like a detonator

JFK
I wouldn’t do that if I were you
The Guards all stop Not knowing what he is going to do

Then Tuck appears out of the wallpaper holding two guns that
are also camo’d in this fashion He aims them at two of the
guards with their guns on JFK Everyone looks at him oddly

‘ JFK
Your comm was out

TUCK
Yeah I figured that out when you weren’t
replying to my witty banter

JFK
Did you get it
(Tuck nods motions to a bag)
Ready to do this

Tuck nods again And with that JFK presses the stylus The
TREO EXPLODES BLOWING A FEW GUARDS BACK

Tuck FIRES taking out the two guards with guns on JFK

JFK elbows the Guard behind him in the face and grabs his arm
with the gun He SHOOTS ANOTHER GUARD twists the first guys
wrist The guard falls to his knees JFK knees him in the
face and grabs the gun

Tuck tosses him another gun JFK catches it and SHOOTS TWO
MORE GUARDS BEHIND TUCK
il

The Guards grab Le Monde and get him out of there as JFK and
Tuck engage in a FULL ON FIRE FIGHT WITH HIS MEN They are
totally in sync a great team two moving like one

DODGING MACHINE GUN FIRE Tuck and JFK take cover round a
corner They catch their breath then look at each other

JFK
Why don’t I distract these guys

TUCK
Why don’t I find us some
transportation

JFK nods then jumps out FIRING WITH TWO GUNS and heading up
the stairs Tuck slips out the other way

The Guards chase after JFK who heads to the roof

-Tuck moves through the house A Guard appears at the door
Tuck COLDCOCKS him He hits the door and goes down Tuck
steps over him and goes outside

He sees another GUARD who pulls his gun but Tuck grabs him
and snaps his neck before he can do anything with it We hear
a little high pitched squeal He drops to the ground

Tuck smashes the window of a BMW with the butt of his gun and
opens the door a

-JFK charges out onte the roof He locks the door We hear
the multitude of Guards coming up the stairs behind him

JFK looks around the roof for something anything There is a
helicopter JFK looks over the side He sees Tuck hotwiring the
BMW down below He opens the door of the helicopter and looks
inside as the Guards start SMASHING THE DOOR OPEN

-The Guards cock their machine guns and BLAST OPEN THE DOOR
to the roof They charge out and see the Helicopter’s rotors
spinning They run to the helicopter They throw open the
door to find it empty

As they do this we see JFK wearing a parachute he grabbed
from the helicopter running in SLOW MOTION towards the edge
of the roof

JFK JUMPS OFF THE ROOF PULLING THE RIPCORD ON THE PARACHUTE

The chute flies out The rotors of the helicopter BLOW IT AND
HIM UP INTO THE AIR AND OFF THE ROOF

DOWN BELOW Tuck starts up the BMW and GUNS IT in reverse as
Guards come plowing out of the doors FIRING at him

JFK in the parachute flies down towards Tuck in the reversing
BMW

The windshield of the fleeing BMW is RIDDLED WITH BULLETS
Tuck kicks it off and FIRES back

JFK lands hard on the hood of the speeding car He climbs
into the front seat pulling the parachute inside as Tuck
covers him Tuck turns to him Both are in disbelief

TUCK
That was pretty cool

JFK
(out of breath)
I thought so

The car SMASHES backwards through the gates
EXT ROAD CONTINUING

The couple who JFK and Tuck gassed earlier wakes up They sit
up justin time to see the backwards BMW fly out in front of
them followed by two cars in pursuit FIRING WILDY They rub
their heads and lie back down

Tuck swerves along the road trying to avoid their gunfire
They run through some trees and almost go off the cliff on
the other side

IF
VE

I don’t want to backseat drive but
if it was me I’d stay on the road

Tuck nods and quickly swerves through the trees and back onto
the road

The cars continue firing at them JFK SHOOTS back at them as
Tuck drives JFK ejects a clip and loads another

TUCK
Hey did you remember to tivo
Grey’s Anatomy

JFK
You are asking me this now

TUCK
Yeah I just thought of it

JFK
I keep explaining to you I have a season
pass so it just tapes it for me

JFK then fires behind them with two guns

TUCK
Hold on

Tuck quickly turns the car out of reverse and starts to drive
out forward Ashe does HE GETS HIT He screams and grabs his
shoulder

As JFK checks Tuck’s wound their back tires now GET BLASTED
ouT Then the back windshield

The TWO CARS ARE GAINING ON THEM JFK looks around for a way
out He sees the parachute and the open back window He
thinks of one but doesn’t like it

JFK
Oh I know I am going to regret this

JFK takes off his seat belt then Tucks He grabs the steering
wheel and swerves the car into the trees and towards the edge
of the cliff The other cars follow

OFK THEN DRIVES THEM RIGHT OFF THE CLIFF Tuck sees what he
is doing and looks very concerned

The pursuing cars pass through the trees and see the cliff
Their eyes go wide but it is too late THEY FLY OFF THE CLIFF

INT CAR - CONTINUING

JFK throws the parachute out the open back windshield he
pulls the lever throwing his chair all the way back and grabs
Tuck

THE PARACHUTE FLIES OUT THE BACK OF THE CAR PULLING JFK AND
TUCK OUT THE OPEN BACKWINDSHIELD OF THE PLUMMETING CAR

They float up past the other two plummeting cars Their
Occupants look at them as they pass by

The cars smash into the rocks below and EXPLODE As JFK and
Tuck float down towards the water

worry We’ll find him

No you wont Because I am taking you both

off field duty for the next little bit

What Why

COLLINS
Because you both put yourselves pretty
far out there with this one There were a
lot of people not happy about what
happened and we need to clean it up
While we do I think it would be best if
you two laid low for a little while
Besides you need to let that heal

HOUSEWIFE 1
Thank you

HOUSEWIFE 2

Lauren laughs One approaches her TRISH Think Joan Cusack

TRISH
That was wonderful What are you
doing now

LAUREN
Probably just some chardonnay and HD Cary
Grant on the big screen TV I’m new to
town I don’t really know anyone

TRISH
Then let me take you out for a drink “He
who shall not be named” has the kids
tonight and I have no plans

LAUREN
Thank you I’d like that
INT BAR - NIGHT

Lauren and Trish sit at a table Men keep checking Lauren
out Trish notices

maven

cad
Normally I don’t like people as good-
looking as you Normally I just smile at
them while secretly wishing that they get
disfigured in a horrible grease accident
Level the playing field if you will

Lauren laughs
TRISH

But you seem smart and nice and you give
me free stuff so I’1l give you a pass

LAUREN
Thank you I think

TRISH
Are you single

LAUREN
Yes

TRISH

Are you online

LAUREN
Am I on what

TRISH
Online Dating sites I’m on Matchcom
Myspace Eharmony JDATE

LAUREN
(looks at the Waspy Trish)
Are you Jewish

TRISE
No but I don’t want to limit myself
When I don’t have the kids I go on three
dates a day Lunch drinks and dinner
It’s like heroin You should try it

LAUREN
I don’t know How do you get to know
someone from their profile I need to
feel that thing That nauseous queasy
pukey feeling in my stomach thing That
thing when you feel it the first time
you just know I can’t tell that online

TRISH
That is why you go on dates But it
helps you weed out the freaks stalkers
pantysnifferscriminals And you‘d be
surprised who’s on there Especially in a
city like this where it’s hard to meet
people Although I can’t imagine you have
a problem

LAUREN
I guess I have it in my head that when I
get married I want it to stick To be
that “one” Like everyone else I want
that perfect guy But maybe he doesn’t
‘exist I have been burned a lot in the
past I‘ll meet a guy who seems great
but then after a iittie bit the bottom
drops out It’s made me a bit more gun
shy And lonely

TRISH
That’s why you can never put all your
eggs in one basket That way if the
bottom does fall out you still have
another basket with more eggs

WAITER
What can I get you ladies

TRISH
Whiskey sour

He turns to Lauren She is looking at the wine list unsure

LAUREN
I’m debating between the 94 Pinot
Noir and the 2003 Chardonnay

WALTER
They are both very good

Lauren can’t decide

TRISH
Have them both We’re gonna be here
for a while Live a little

LAUREN
All right both it is Ch and if anyone

asks where the alcoholics are sitting

She motions to the two of them The Waiter laughs and walks off

This gets a laugh His eighty something GRANDMOTHER who sits

holding hands with his GRANDFATHER calis out

NANA FOSTER
We love all of our Grandchildren equally

JFK

Thats what they say when everyone’s
around so the rest of you all don’t feel
bad But when we’re alone they tell me
I’m their favorite I thought it was time
the truth came out

(to Nana and Grandpa)
I love you guys so much We all do
You’re our heroes our loves our hearts
Sc everyone raise their glass

(everyone does)
Nana Grandpa happy 60th anniversary I
only hope that someday I can find what
you guys did

Everyone applauds

JFK
Now their lesser loved grandchildren are
gonna say some words

-People mingle dance JFK and Tuck greethug relatives

JPR
Big sister hey How’s the Brain
Surgery business

MAHATMA
Good had two successful ones today
How’s the luxury vacuum business

JFK
Good we just got back from a European
trip That market is really exploding for
us And with the new baglessno clogging
technology it is a really exciting time

We see that JFK’s family has no idea what he really does

-JFK and Tuck chat with other family members We see that
Tuck is equally part of the family

-They dance with his LITTLE NIECES AND NEPHEWS We see that
JFK is the only one not married with children

JFK and Tuck sit with a drink off by themselves Nana and
Grandpa come over and sit with them

NANA FOSTER
(shaking her head)
Favorite grandchild

JFK
I was just speaking the truth

NANA FOSTER
I know but you are not supposed to
do it in front of everyone

TUCK
What about me by the way

GRANDPA FOSTER
You‘re our favorite non blood relative
grandchild

TUCK
I can live with that

They sit and share a drink together They leok at all the
families couples out dancing with their spouseschildren

NANA FOSTER
So when are we gonna see the two of
you out there dancing with your
wives and children

(

JFK
When we find someone as great as
you Nana

NANA FOSTER
That’s a good answer But you both
better hurry up because before I die I
wanna see you both married and happy And
I want great grandchildren

JFK
You already have great grandchildren

NANA FOSTER
Yes but I want more great
grandchildren It’s like crack you
can never have enough

TUCK
To be fair Nana I have already
been married and have already
provided a great grandchild

NANA FOSTER
Yes but that doesn’t count because
you screwed it up

Grandpa then gets up and takes his wife’s hand

GRANDPA FOSTER
Come on Lilah let’s show these
kids how it’s done ¢

He takes her hand and they go out on the dance floor Tuck
and JFK watch them Nana and Grandpa look into each other’s
eyes and just smile JFK and Tuck both just sit there and
watch them in silence After a moment Tuck looks over at
JFK He seems really pensive

TUCK
What are you thinking

JFK

-That I want that That I want
someone to look at me the way they
are looking at each other To be
able to look into someone’s eyes like
that on your sixtieth anniversary and
still look like you love them as much
as you did the day you got married

(ponders)
Anyway I was just thinking that I
want that

TUCK
«Yeah

JFK
But then I was thinking that even if
I met that person and got married
tomorrow which seems a rather
unlikely scenario I still might not
get there You stop and do the math
and it’s kind of depressing I mean
as much as I hate to admit it we’re
not exactly twenty anymore

TUCK
We‘’re not even exactly thirty anymore

JFK
And with what we do

TUCK
Yeah I’ve been thinking about that a lot
lately I love what we do and our jobs
and all But it hit me that if that was
it the other day-- what have I left
behind An ex-wife who hates me and son I
barely see In that moment bleeding
and plunging off a cliff I realized that
all I have is you I mean no offence
because you know I love you but I want
more than that

oFK
None taken Me too

TUCK
So what are we gonna do about it

JFK
I don’t know start looking I guess And
I don’t mean girls we’re never gonna see
again in Spain Im talking about really
looking About finding that

He motions to his very much still in love Grandparents

TUCK -
Well we do have some free time

BEGIN MONTAGE of JFK AND TUCK DATING

TUCK
-We haven’t even ordered dinner yet

She then starts to SOB LOUDLY Tuck sighs

-JFK sits with a WOMAN who just stares at him not saying a

is getting really uncomfortable

A BUTCH WOMAN sits with Tuck

BUTCH WOMAN

-JFK and Tuck sit demoralized eating Chinese food and
watching Grey’s Anatomy A commercial comes on for Matchcom

ANNOUNCER GUY

They watch intrigued Then turn to each other and laugh

TUCK

JFK

-Later JFK paces in his room looking at the computer After a
beat He sits down and looks at the site He sees some of the
WOMAN on it He nods -- not bad

Tuck is already posting his profile

JFK takes one of his cuff-link spy cameras He sets it on
the dresser He smiles awkwardly and snaps a photo of
himself He looks It is terrible He tries again

Tuck goes into his hallway and knocks on his neighbor’s
door An elderly KOREAN WOMAN answers He speaks a few words
to her in Korean and then hands her camera She takes the
camera He smiles and we see a FLASH

-Lauren walks in with another brand of wine FLASH One of
the woman snaps her picture while another types on a laptop

TRISH

Trish starts to close the laptop Lauren smiles

LAUREN
Okay so he’s charming

ANNA MAE
And he’s effin hot

Lauren sits and reads some more She is getting into this
INT VIDEO STORE - NIGHT

JFK walks in As he alwaysdoes he surveys the place
EMPLOYEES CUSTOMERS cameras escape routes We see he has
his gun tucked into the back of his pants under his sweater --
always prepared Lauren walks in She comes up to him

LAUREN
John

JFK
Yes but everybody just calls me JFK

LAUREN
Okay -- needs an explanation though

JFK
My full name’s John Fitzgerald Kennedy
Foster My parents named all of us after
great people They hoped it would instill
in us a desire to measure up

LAUREN
I like your parents What are your
siblings names

JFK
Albert Einstein Foster Mahatma Gandhi
Foster Eleanor Roosevelt Foster and
last but certainly not least Elvis Aaron
Presley Foster My parents were big fans

She laughs The chemistry is palpable

LAUREN
Well I am just regular old Lauren
beat)
You are supposed to say Lauren
there is nothing regular about you

OFK
Well we don’t know each other so I
don’t want to make a judgement call in
that area just yet Ask me again after we
have gone out a few times

LAUREN
Confident You’re assuming this is
gonna go well
(smiles)
Well see So JFK what movie do
you wanna watch

JFK
What movie would you like to watch
Lauren

LAUREN
Ohh you’re not getting off the hook that
easily although nice of you to offer
But I want you to choose

oFK
Hmm a test I like tests All right
weli I could go with something easy like
Breakfast at Tiffanys or CasablancaBut
you would see right through that

LAUREN
I would You don’t want to be seen as
pandering this early on

JFK

I don’t which is why I am not going to
be choosing anything starring Audrey
Hepburn Katherine Hepburn or any sort
of Hepburn

(She laughs)
So then I could go the other way and pick
something manly some SchwarzenaggerJohn
WayneSteve McQueen lay down the law let
you know who’s boss

LAUREN
And then I’d leave
JFK
Exactly and that is not me anyway
They walk through the aisles peruse the genres

JFK
I could go with Horror because then

LAUREN
(smiles)
I would get scared and jump in your lap
Problem is I don’t scare easily

JFK
Well I would just have to choose
something really freaky then
(MORE)
JFK (contd)
Some AliensExorcistOmen Something
really lap jumping into-ish But it’s
our first date and I wanna show you I’m a
gentleman -- which I am by the way You
can call my grandmother and ask if you
don’t believe me So I won’t be going with
horror

LAUREN
Grandmother reference good drop

JFK
Thank you Along the same line I could
pick something that’s just plain bad
because

LAUREN
-»--Then I would want to shut it off
and do “other” things

JFK
Correct But again I won’t be going that
route because I wouldn’t want you to
think that all I want is something
physical right from the start I want you
to think I am leoking for something more -
-- which I am So I then could try to
impress you

LAUREN
By choosing something foreign a
documentary perhaps -- show you

have taste class culture

JFK
Which I do but am secure in that and
don’t need to overcompensate by picking
something boring that neither of us
really want to watch In my opinion
movies should be entertaining-—

LAUREN
An escape something to relax to I
totally agree Some Sci-Fi then

JFK
Which I love but I wouldn’t want to out
myself as a geek this early I’1ll save
the Han Solo vs Indiana Jones debate
until at least the fourth date

LAUREN
Again with the talk of future
dates Confident

JFK
I am Drama

LAUREN
Too serious

JFK
comedy

LAUREN

Too polarizing What if we don’t
find the same things funny You
seem too careful for that

JFK
I am So in the end I would have to
go with

He hands her a DVD Hitchcocks Lady Vanishes

LAUREN
The Lady Vanishes Why

JFK

Well for starters you can’t really go
too wrong with Hitchcock Secondly it
kinda has it all It has comedy funny
but not too silly It has drama romance
It’s a thriller which may lead to some
inadvertent arm grabs But I promise not
to grab you too hard

she- laughs)
Its classy but not stuffy And whereas
most real movie fans have seen the North
by Northwest and Rear Windows of the
world This one is more obscure It has
everything those do except you may have
not seen it in which case you’ll like me
for introducing you to it or if you have
seen it you’ll know what a could pick it
was

LAUREN
(charmed)
I have seen it and it is a good choice

They look at each other They are connecting

JEK
So should I get this and then we can
get out of here

LAUREN
Oh we’re not watching it

JFK
(confused)
We‘re not

LAUREN
Please watching a movie on a couch
with someone I just met five minutes
agowe won’t be doing that What kind
of girl do you think I am But you did
pass so if you would like to take me
to dinner say Saturdayhere’s my
number you can give me a call

JFK

Were not I’m just saying

(Silence)

This sucks
TUCK

I know
JFK

Well just both have to tell her that
neither of us can go out with her -

TUCK
---Unless we don’t
(JFK turns and looks at him)
(MORE)
TUCK (contd)

Just stay with me for a second here We
both agree she’s great And we both know
how hard it is to find someone like that
How many dates have both us been on the
past few weeks They are all crazy and
terrible It would be a shame if neither
of us had a chance to be with her

JFK
So what aré you saying

TUCK
I am saying that maybe we shouldn‘t
be so hasty maybe we should let
her have a say in all this

JFK
What You‘’re saying that we should
both date her

TUCK
Why not
(JFK looks at him)

Okay there are a lot of reasons why not
But what if she really is “the one” for
one of us I mean she can’t be “the one”
for both ef us can she And what if one
of us is the perfect guy for her Is it
really fair of us to deprive her of that

JFK
(coming around)
We are good guys

TUCK
Yeah we are I am just saying she has got
to be more right for one of us than the
other And we don’t know who that is yet
We’ve both only seen her twice Maybe we
should both just go out with her some more
and see Maybe one of us will realize that
there isn’t anything there and then there
won’t be a problem But if neither of us
does you know we’re always gonna wonder if
there was something real there and we let
it get away

JFK
Okay but if we do this were
gonna need some ground rules

TUCK
Of course

JFK
We can’t tell her we know each other I
dont see her going for it if she knows
were best friends

(MORE)

48

JFK (contd)
We both just date her and do our own ©
thing and stay out of each others’ way
We let her decide which one of us she
wants to be with And if at any point
this starts to affect us or our
friendship in any way we have to agree
to just walk away Cuz it’s not worth it

TUCK
Yes Agreed It’s like some very wise man
once said “Bros before Hos” It might
have been Socrates I don’t remember

JEK
And no sleeping with her while we
are both dating her

TUCK
Of course because that would be

JFK
Yeah Good luck

TUCK
You too May the most right man
win Wanna go watch some 24

calmly keeps counting the money He then puts it away

JFK
You don’t really want to be doing that

JFK
I’m just thinking of you here But in my

going home and you know spending some time
rethinking your chosen career choice

MUGGER
Oh yeah what are you gonna do

JFK just looks at him and we CUT TO

LAUREN
I just wonder if he will ever grow up

OFK
Yes that is a good question
Lauren One that needs to be asked

LAUREN
And part of me doesn’t ever want him too

Tuck looks at JFK see

LAUREN
But part of me wonders if this is the
person I really wanna grow old with Is
he built for that

And Tuck’s happiness goes right back away

TRISH
And what about the other one

LAUREN
JFK He I wonder if he is too grown up
sometimes Everything is always so planned

TUCK
(glaring at JFK)
Yes it is

LAUREN
So perfect

TRISH
And that’s a problem Now perfect is a
problem Cuz I‘d take perfect

JFK
You tell her Trish

LAUREN
No It’s great I just wonder if he ever
truly lets his guard down If he can be
spontaneous because I need that

TUCK
Not ever gonna happen

JFK makes a face

LAUREN
Like after he saved me from that mugger
we had this amazing night returning all
the stolen things and I was ready to just
jump him and he was just so concerned
about getting to the concert

JFK
(defensive)
I spent a lot of money on those
tickets I thought she-

LAUREN
I didn’t care about the concert I just
wanted to spend time with him but of
course we couldn’t deviate from the plan

Tuck smiles You are so stupid JFK just sits there

LAUREN
And Tuck has that fly by the seat of your
pants quality that I love but can I
count on him Will I feel safe with him
--But then again I wonder if JPK will
ever let his guard down long enough to
really let me in

The guys both ponder this

TRISH
I don’t know honey I guess you are gonna
have to probe a little deeper and see

LAUREN
Yeah

The guys look at each other They both heard things the
didn’t really want to hear The truce over JFK grabs his sub
and gets out of the van Tuck sits there thinking

InT PAINTBALL FIELD - DAY

Tuck and Lauren suit up for a game of Paintball Tuck loads
multiple weapons as if he is going on a mission or to war

TUCK
Have you ever done this before

LAUREN
No but it sounds fun

TUCK

Yeah it’s fun and all But it’s also
good preparation Shows you how people
would handle themselves in a similar real
life similar situation with real life or
death stakes Which you have to worry
about in this post 9-11 day and age

(Tuck cocks his gun)
Just stay with me I’‘1l keep you safe

Tuck winks at her Tuck stands with the two guns and starts
FIRING Lauren follows trying to keep up

-Tuck with laser precision takes out a TEAM OF GUYS He
shoots until his ammo is out and then tosses his guns

-Tuck jumps out of the bushes and surprises a KID Tuck nails
him the kid starts to cry Lauren mouthes “I am so sorry”

Tuck and Lauren are cornered behind a tree trunk Tuck is
out of ammo Lauren is just having fun Tuck is very serious

TUCK
I’m out

LAUREN
Well I guess that’s what happens
when you have shot everyone

TUCK
Not everyone And it’s not over yet Do
you think I am gonna let my girl go home
covered in paint Cuz if you think that
You must think you are here with a
different guy and not me

Tuck checks out the area using a spy mirror There are GUYS
EVERYWHERE He looks at Lauren’s gun She has two shots left

From the other side we see TWO GUYS CHARGING towards them
Tuck QUICKLY SHOOTS BOTH OF THEM SQUARE BETWEEN the eyes

They moan as the paintballs hit their goggles and knock them
down Tuck dives grabbing their Paintball guns and remainin
ammo HE STANDS AND SLOWLY STARTS TAKING OUT EVERY OTHER GUY

They all fire at him But like the Terminator he walks
through the fray without fear firing left and right as
paintballs hit the ground by his feet and whiz by his face

Lauren watches amazed Then running in from the right Lauren
sees a pack of FEROCIOUS LOOKING KIDS heading towards him

LAUREN
Tuck three 0 clock

Tuck quickly GRABS AN OVERWEIGHT ACCOUNTANT GUY AND USES HIM
AS A HUMAN SHIELD All the kids shots nail the accountant
Then Tuck empties his paint clips into the kids They all go
down Tuck is the last man standing

Lauren walks up to him past all the downed paint covered
people Tuck turns to her and smiles

TUCK
Wanna get lunch

Lauren nods speechless

EXT PAINTBALL FIELD PARKING LOT - LATER

Tuck and Lauren all cleaned up walk to the car in the
deserted parking lot She turns to him

LAUREN
Well I certainly will feel safe around
you from now on If armies of gun toting
ninjas ever attack you’re my guy

Tuck laughs Without her seeing Tuck motions to someone to
back off In the shadows we see SOME MEMBERS OF HIS TEAM
DRESSED AS TOUGHS WITH STICKS CHAINS They slowly back away
Tuck turns back to Lauren

TUCK
So tonight I was thinking we could do
some grown-up things Mature stuff
Reading historical non fiction
critiquing art whatever you want

LAUREN
Okay

He is saying all the right things It is like he heard her

complaints and it is music to her ears She smiles

Lauren spits out her drink

things on the table He barks at Lauren Tuck’s shady looking
Uncle pipes up He speaks with an eastern European accent and
has been eyeing her up and down

UNCLE NICO

Lauren turns to Tuck

TUCK

UNCLE NICO
I am Tuck’s godfather Nico

He kisses Lauren’s hand and holds it a little too long

LAUREN
And what do you do

UNCLE NICO
I sell organs on the black market
If you ever wake up in a strange
motel in a bathtub of ice there’s a
very strong likelihood that was me

The silent brother passes Lauren a note It says “CAN I
SEE YOUR BREAST” He looks at her expectantly

LAUREN
(in disbelief)
No no you can’t

He passes her another note which says “ILL GIVE YOU FIVE
DOLLARS” Lauren just sighs She looks around for anything
normal She focuses in on Tuck’s sweet looking Grandmother

LAUREN
And you must be Tuck’s favorite
Grandmother NONNY that I have heard so
much about

NONNY
(with a German accent)
Yah I love him

LAUREN
What a pretty accent you have
Where are you from

NONNY
Germany

LAUREN
Oh I have always wanted to go there I
hear it is such a great place

NONNY
It used to be Now it is a shit hole It
was wonderful before you Americans and
your bitch boy British friends came in
and ruined everything in the forties

She slams her fist angrily on the table and starts RANTING IN
GERMAN Lauren looks aghast Then sees that she is wearing
Nazi insignia earrings She thrusts her hand into the air

NONNY
HAIL HITLER

The Rest of the Family now follows It’s like their form of
grace The Creepy Kid then passes Lauren another note We
don’t see what it says but Lauren has a horrified disgusted
look on her face She crumples it up Then she feels
something under the table She looks the Masked Kid seems to
be HUMPING HER LEG Lauren stands She can’t take it anymore

LAUREN
You know what I actually have to
be getting back to work But it
was great meeting you all

Lauren starts to walk away As she does Uncle Nico mouths
CALL ME Lauren makes a face Tuck heads after her

TUCK

Tuck catches up to her at the valet

TUCK
Okay those people are not my family

LAUREN

Those people that just twenty minutes ago
you introduced to me as your family

TUCK
Yes I have never seen them before
in my life

LAUREN

You know that back there wasoffensive
on so many levels I can’t even begin
But what may be even worse is you just
now telling me that they aren’t actually
your family So theyre crazy That
doesn’t mean you’re that way But to
pretend that you don’t even know them-

TUCK
Lauren

She turns away from him and just stands there waiting for
her car to come from valet Tuck takes a deep breath

TUCK
De you want the truth
LAUREN
Yes That would be nice

TUCK
I don’t have a family My Mom passed a
away a few years ago I never knew my dad
The only real family I have is an ex-wife
who hates me and a son I hardly know

The VALET hands her her keys She could go but

LAUREN
Why didn’t you just tell me that

TUCK

I don’t know because I am an idiot I
was embarrassed I know you could be with

I just don’t see him that much His Mom --
rightly so isn’t my biggest fan She has
a lot of anger towards me And because of

LAUREN

Inside through the window Karen watches Whether she will
admit it or not we can see from her look that she still has
feelings for him and she’s not sure how she feels about this

TUCK
So Lauren has this really cool job

LAUREN
And I was wondering if you don’t mind if
you could help me out with it today

down They move on

great Tuck And you’re great with him
(Tuck nods)
So what happened with you and his Mom

TUCK
We met in college We were college
sweethearts The perfect couple She’s
everything a guy could want An
amazing person And a really a great
Mom I loved her a lot

LAUREN
So what happened

TUCK
Honestly I was too young Too immature
What do you do if you meet that person
that one but it’s not the right time I
knew I wasn’t ready But we got married
anyway And then we had a kid And then
quite honestly I screwed it up My job
18» svery demanding you know being a
cruise ship captain It requires me to be
away a lot And I kinda threw myself into
it and used it as an excuse to not be
there I let her down And I really
regret it

LAUREN
Have you ever told her that

TUCK
No that ship’s sailed A long time ago
Sometimes it’s just too late and you
can’t £ix something But I promised
myself that I wasn’t gonna make the same
mistake again That when I found someone
that I was crazy about That was amazing
That I was gonna fight tooth and nail for
them To keep them

He looks at her really deeply She is touched having him
open up like this too her she is falling hard for him as
well Lauren kisses him It gets more and more passionate

Across the way we see SOMEONE ELSE WATCHING BOTH THEM AND
JFK‘s TEAM WATCHING THEM They snap away pictures

INT TUCK’S APARTMENT NIGHT

Tuck throws open the door He and Lauren keep kissing He has
been waiting for this for so long Tuck is like an animal
knocking things down Tearing clothes off They make out on
the floor As they continue we FADE TO BLACK

Tuck and Lauren now lie on the floor together post you know
He amiling Her less so It was great But she is starting
to feel guilty Because he knows he should Tuck goes to
cuddle with her And Lauren again walks out of the room sans
cuddling After she does Tuck pumps his fists into the air

TUCK
Yes I knew she was the perfect woman

-Lauren walks into the kitchen but instead of pouring a
glass of water she pours herself a stiff drink

INT LAUREN’S WOMEN’S GROUP - THE NEXT MORNING
Lauren sits with the women’s group feeling awful

LAUREN

“AY” on my shirt for the rest of my days

not married and we’re not in a
Nathaniel Hawthorne novel

ANNA MAE
Look you care about both of them

LAUREN

TRISH
It is very quaint of you to even be
worrying about it But we all know that
if you were a man we wouldn’t even be
having this discussion

LAUREN
Okay that’s very true But I didn’t
mean to sleep with both of them I wanted
to of course but I wasn’t going to until
I chose It just happened

INT CDO SHOOTING RANGE DAY

Each grabs weapons from the closet all crazy guns of all
different shapes and sizes They each load mags into the guns
as if they were going to war Each steps onto the shooting
range eyeing the other The LAB TECH sets the sequence

LAB TECH
Sequence four Urban Warfare Agents Solo
and Kaplan on the range

He flips on the program It is pretty cool We see a changing
projected ENVIRONMENT onto the range with hologram people and
TERRORISTS walking through shooting It’s like a really cool
live video game State of the Art Government Style

Tuck and JFK start shooting The tension is fierce

TUCK
That was low sending in those people
pretending to be my family

JFK
That’s what you get for hiring a
fake family in the first place

TUCK
I wouldn‘t have had to if you weren’t
pandering by bringing her to meet yours

He nails two targets

JFK
Pandering What were you going to do if
she chose you Have them on the payroll
for the rest of your relationship

TUCK

Maybe

(He empties an UZI into a cG

Terrorist cell)
Or fake their death in a horrible
hang-gliding accident But it
doesn’t matter I didn’t need a big
perfect family to get her

JFK
No you just needed your previously
neglected son

They are both out Tuck pissed grabs an even bigger gun

JFK
Overcompensating for something

TUCK
Projecting much

Both of them FIRE taking out targets left and right It is
getting more and more competitive and heated

JFK
This has gone on long enough It’s
time for you to back down

TUCK
Me why me

JFK starts shooting with two guns

TUCK
Which is why I am not gonna blow it
this time

Tuck now grabs two MACHINE GUNS

TUCK
I am sticking this one out And if you
think I would even consider backing off
then you are as bad of a judge of
character as you are a shot

JFK pissed quickly FIRES with two guns bulls-eye- nailing
five targets Tuck then empties his clip The siren rings
The simulation shuts down Their scores come up They tied
They throw down their guns and turn to each other

JFK
From now on it’s on

TUCK
It’s so on And all gloves are off

JFK
Bring it

TUCK
And by the way whoever she chooses -

more important the love of your life or your best friend

haven’t been sleeping I am finding new
grey hairs by the hour I have toe decide
And they have both been acting so
strange I can’t keep doing this It’s
not fair to them and I am gonna have a
nervous breakdown You know maybe I
could bring both of them by or arrange
for you guys to accidentally meet them
and you could tell me what you think

TRISH
This isn’t some product Lauren this
is your life We can’t decide this
one for you This is something that
you need to decide your self

How’s it going

LAUREN
I’m trying to write them both letters
But have been just staring at the same
blank pages for hours You can’t love two
people equally can you

TRISH
Love yes Be in love with I don’t think
so Let me ask you a question Have you
ever made apple whiskey

LAUREN
No Why Have you

TRISH
Yes it’s wonderful But in order to
make even a little bit of whiskey you
have to fill an entire bucket of apple
cider Then you have to freeze the whole
thing In the center there is a tiny
little part that doesn’t freeze That’s
the whiskey None of the other stuff
matters It’s just that little core that
little thing that you wanted all along
that’s all you keep The rest you throw
away But you had to go through all of
the other stuff to get there

LAUREN
You’re saying I am overcomplicating this

TRISH

Yes you spend your life looking at every
detail all the parts what some people
like what others don’t And you have lost
sight of just what you like What you wanted
in the first place So I am telling you to
forget all the insane dates and grand
gestures all that other stuff and just get
to that simple core That first moment when
you first met them what did you feel

(Lauren thinks remembers)
And was it the same with both of them

LAUREN
(realizing)
-«No Thank you

You’re welcome Now give the other
one my number

him he’s not going to blow it

JFK and Tuck are about to get on when more guys START
SHOOTING at them They can’t leave Lauren So all three of
them and get on the ATV with JFK in the front Lauren in the
middle and Tuck in the back A fact not lost on anyone

TUCK
She’s between us again

JFK smiles slyly and they take off The Men shooting at them
now get on the remaining ATV’s and head after them

INT GALLERIA - CONTINUING
The all fly through the mall chasing firing Le Monde sees

a subway entrance They drive down it He then sees them with
the briefcase nuke following him

INT JASON AND KAREN‘’S HOUSE
Jason and Karen watch this on the TV in disbelief

JASON

(Karen nods speechless)
--Z am guessing him and Uncle JFK

KAREN
I guess not

INT SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUING

Le Monde and the others fly down the stairs onto the
platform They then drive off the platform onto the tracks

JFK Lauren and Tuck follow They chase each other down the
tracks Swerving back and forth between the tracks to avoid
ONCOMING TRAINS JFK fires at the ATVs ahead of them Tuck
shoots at the ones behind them Lauren marvels at the
craziness of it all

LAUREN
So is this basically like a day at
the office for you guys

JFK
Yeah pretty much

TUCK
There’s not always ATVs and subway
tracks But the rest is pretty
much par for the course

They round a corner The Guy in front of them turns to shoot
As does A SUBWAY TRAIN COMES AROUND THE BEND SMASHING INTO
HIM HEAD ON It flies by our guys on the other track

TUCK
Make sure you are watching out for those

JFK nods The Guy on the ATV in front of them turns to fire
at them Up ahead JFK sees A STOP GATE along the wall JFK
aims and shoots at it The gate drops As he is about to fire
the guy hits it It KNOCKS him RIGHT off the ATV

JFK Lauren and Tuck all duck as they head under the pole
then smash into the back of the unmanned ATV JFK quickly
runs and jumps onto it He grabs the controls and heads out
after Le Monde as Lauren grabs the controls of theres

TUCK
Do you remember how to drive these

LAUREN
Yeah I had a good teacher

Tuck smiles He starts shooting at the GUYS behind them as
Lauren drives JFK heads up towards Le Monde Le Monde fires
back at hin

A SUBWAY TRAIN heads their way Le Monde swerves onto the
other track So does JFK Lauren and Tuck do too Lauren
slams into the side THE TRAIN JUST MISSES THEM They smile
Then Tuck’s smile goes away He sees another train heading
towards them from behind

TUCK
Lauren another train

Le Monde and JFK swerve back onto the other track out of it’s
way Lauren tries to but their wheels got in some groove

LAUREN
I can’t We’re stuck

THE TRAIN IS HEADING RIGHT TOWARDS THEM FROM BEHIND The
Conductor sees them and tries to slow down

JFK is almost on Le Monde He looks back and sees them He
instantly drops back He pulls alongside Tuck and Lauren

TUCK
Take her

LAUREN
What about you

TUCK
Don’t worry about me just go

As the train approaches Lauren leans out JFK grabs her arm
Lauren looks scared But JFK‘’s eyes reassure her
JFK
I got you

She nods and JUMPS JFK grabs her swinging her around and
pulling her onto him She is now straddling him as he drives

Tuck guns it on the other track as the train heads towards
him As it is about to hit the ATV Tuck turns and JUMPS ONTO
THE FRONT OF THE TRAIN He is face to face with the SUBWAY
CONDUCTOR holding onto the windshield Tuck smiles at him
The Conductor smiles back

JFK and Lauren watch relieved Then look at each other

JFK

I know you think I am too careful Too
much of a planner Now you know whys But
I didn’t plan you I didn’t plan this
And for the first time in my life I like
that I don‘t know where it is going or
where you are going to take me Whatever
you choose Whether we live through this
or not I wanted you to know that and
that I love you

LAUREN
I-

And then an ATV SLAMS INTO THEM FROM BEHIND The driver jumps
off the front of his and onto the back of theres He throws a
wire around JFK’s neck and starts strangling him Tuck on the
Subway watches Le Monde He then looks at the subway
conductor and motions for him to speed up

Le Monde drives The subway train pulls alongside him He
sees Tuck Tuck smiles at him and then jumps onto his ATV

They are nearing the end of the line The track is about to
run out and they are into the still under construction area
The Guy continues to choke JFK He holds the wire with both
hands Choking he mouthes to Lauren

JFK
Gun

Lauren grabs it from his shoulder holster She pulls it out
JFK headbutts back into the Guys face Lauren hands him his
gun and JFK SHOOTS HIM OFF THE BACK OF THE ATV

Tuck and Le Monde SMASH through UNDER CONSTRUCTION SIGNS
Lauren and JFK follow And they soon see why it is under
construction the track is running out RIGHT INTO A DEEP
HOLE They all see it and DIVE OFF THE ATVs

They all hit the ground The ATVs fly off the end of the
track into the cavern below

Tuck and JFK panting start to get up

LE MONDE (0S)
Careful

Le Monde is already standing his gun on Lauren

LE MONDE
It was very amusing to watch you both
bicker over her and fight with each
other I would have just killed you if
it hadn’t been so much fun to watch She
must be something special
He smells her hair and picks up the nuke

LE MONDE
It’s ironic isn’t it If you hadn‘t been
so preoccupied with her and each other
it might not have gotten to this point

He motions to the nuke and Lauren He backs towards the exit

LE MONDE
Au revo-

With this JFK and Tuck WITHOUT HESITATING BOTH DRAW THEIR
GUNS AND SHOOT Each bullet hits Le Monde right in each eye
He goes down Lauren looks at him and then runs to JFK

He grabs her relieved that she is okay And then it dawns on
all of them what this reflexive action meant She quickly
pulls away and hugs Tuck as well But as she does Tuck and JFK

ook at each other They now know she was gonna choose JFK

INT GALLERIA FOOD COURT - DAY

A PARAMEDIC finishes tending to Lauren’s cuts and bruises He
leaves JFK and Tuck walk up She looks at them

LAUREN
Regardless of the lying which I do get
why you did I think you are both great
guys The best guys

TUCK
But-

LAUREN
But I can’t come between you I saw
how I have today And what that did
to you both I couldn’t live with
myself if I kept doing that

She then kisses both of them on the cheek and leaves Lauren
walks off with the Women from the group

TRISH
If you are not gonna take either of
them can I

Marylin hits her Anna Mae puts her arm around Lauren They
walk off The guys sadly watch her go

JFK
Wanna get a beer

TUCK
Yeah

They start to walk off

JFK
Not to get all mushy and
everything but I missed you

TUCK
Yeah me too

INT JFK’S CONDO - A FEW DAYS LATER

JFK and Tuck sit on JFK’s couch drinking beer and watching
the game It’s just like old times except it’s not

TUCK
-»-So we both know she chose you

JFK
We don’t know that

TUCK
Yes we both do She went to you not me

JFK
That was just

TUCK
And I read these

Tuck takes out the letters Lauren wrote to both of them

TUCK

(reads)
“Tuck we are so much a like in many
ways You have brought such joy and fun
to my life But in many ways I think we
are too much alike” I’ll save you
from hearing the rest but basically she
says she loves me but I am more like her
brother Where I’m from you don’t have
sex with your brother But whatever
maybe that is different in Boston She
also thinks I am still in love with
Karen You on the other hand make her
sick Whatever the hell that means

JFK knows He takes the letter from him and reads
TUCK
The point is she picked you She wants you

JEK
It doesn’t matter We let her tear us apart
once As much as I may want it it’s not
worth it So0 how bout that game

Tuck nods JFK turns on the TV and they start watching Tuck
looks at him he is gonna do something about it
