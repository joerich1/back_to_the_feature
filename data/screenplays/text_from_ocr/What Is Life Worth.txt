WHAT IS LIFE WORTH

by

Max Borenstein

from the memoir by
Kenneth R Feinberg

July 30 2008
ARCHIVE TELEVISION FOOTAGE

It is summer of 2001 North and South coast to coast the
PEOPLE OF AMERICA people of every shape and size and color
and creed are going about their daily lives

The HUMAN INTEREST MEDIA covers it all Salmonella at a
Wabash County Arby’s the Ten Commandments in an Alabama
courthouse a looming onslaught of Africanized killer bees

This is a nation profoundly at peace

INT METLIFE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The sleek main conference room of the insurance giant But
this might as well be the battlefield of Gettysburg or a
Tijuana dogfighting pit The air is acrid with bloodlust

Two teams of ATTORNEYS flank the black onyx table Armed for
battle Pens cocked attaches at the ready Their uneasy eyes
are fixed on the one man keeping the peace the mediator
KENNETH FEINBERG early 40s is the picture of composure He
straightens a gold cuff link embossed with the scales of
justice As the attorneys wait

KEN
Did anyone bring a CD player

A confused murmur ripples the ranks Heads shake

KEN (CONTD)
I was thinking Coltrane A Love Supreme

Ken hums a phrase of the tune Both sides stare blankly

KEN (CONTD)
No

The chief lawyer for the PLAINTIFF shifts in her seat

PLAINTIFF
Mr Feinberg if we’re ready to begin

KEN
We’re not

She falls silent Opposing counsel smirks at the squelch

DEFENSE
Oh Ken before I forget Joan made
me promise to send her best to Dede
(MORE )
DEFENSE (CONTD)
I guess they co-chaired an Asthma and
Allergy luncheon last spring

KEN
(deadpan)
Dede who

DEFENSE
--huh
(panicking)
Maybe I’m forgetting her name
Your wife

A beat Excruciating

KEN
Oh That Dede

Awkward snickers pepper the opposing side

PLAINTIFF
(losing patience)

With all due respect Mr Feinberg
my firm may be working this case
pro bono but our time is still
valuable I think it’s safe to say
both sides only consented to submit
to mediation on judge’s orders

Nods of assent from both camps

PLAINTIFF (CONTD)

Apparently we do agree on some things
(a beat)

All the same in the interest of

moving forward let me be clear my

clients are not in this case for

the money and have no intention of

settling for any half-measure

compromise that lets this company

off with a slap on the wrist

DEFENSE
(taking the bait)
That’s very well counsel because
my client won’t be making any
offers The company is committed to
fighting these false and malicious
allegations in a court of law

PLAINTIFF
False We have over 600 pages of
documentary evidence
The Plaintiff brandishes a massive bound document the
“COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES” The Defense flaunts an even thicker
volume the “LIFE INSURANCE TERMS OF SERVICE”

DEFENSE
Our Terms of Service are perfectly
clear

The attorneys trade salvos of legal bluster A poor
STENOGRAPHER sweats to keep up

At some point in the skirmish the two massive documents land
thump-thump in front of Ken the “Complaint for Damages” and
the “Terms of Service”

Ken aligns the tomes side by side comparing their bulk He
hums softly to himself the melody of “A Love Supreme”

After a moment the bickering attorneys fall to a hush
KEN
(looks up)

Hm Oh you can carry on

Ken continues to hum The attorneys share baffled looks

PLAINTIFF
Mr Feinberg
DEFENSE
Ken
KEN
How much do you think they weigh
DEFENSE
I’m sorry
PLAINTIFF

How much does what weigh
Ken hefts both the “Complaint” and “Terms of Service”

KEN
These documents
(a beat)
Camille do you have your scale

On cue Ken’s assistant and trusty gal Friday (CAMILLE BIROS)
produces a Weight Watchers food scale from her purse sets it
before Ken
KEN (CONTD)
Because it occurs to me we could
resolve this all right now if we
just agreed
(brandishing documents)
If these bad boys weigh in under a
pound you go to war

He drops the thick “Complaint” onto the scale with a thud
The digital readout blinks nines maxed out

Ken lifts the even larger “Terms of Service”
KEN (CONTD)
But me I’d settle any case that

could break a toe

THUNK SMASH TO OUR TITLE SCREEN

WHAT IS LIFE WORTH

INT METLIFE BUILDING - PRESS ROOM - DAY

Flashbulbs pop Cameras roll Plaintiff and Defense pose for
a handshake to memorialize their newly minted settlement

Ken and Camille depart from the lonely rear of the room
Unnoticed by the press forgotten by Plaintiff and Defense

CAMILLE
Ever wish it was you up there

Ken glances back The media The spotlight The American
dream He and Camille share a half-smile “Don’t you”

KEN
Did you pick up the earrings
INT COMMUTER JET - FIRST CLASS - DAY

The plane is mid-take off The sky out the porthole is a
vivid wash of reds and purples Camille is entranced

Ken occupies the window seat half-blocking her view but he
is too busy scrutinizing a hand-crafted set of Art Deco
earrings to notice He compares them to a photograph

FULL FRAME A sepia wedding photo from the 1940s The same
earrings are worn by a young bride (Ken’s MOTHER-IN-LAW)
KEN
These are perfect Dede is going to
flip Don’t forget to send a thank
you to Maurice And a bottle of
that kosher champagne And tell him
well set up a lunch next week to
go over his De Beers contract

But Camille is rapt by the sunset which now silhouettes the
lower Manhattan skyline The TWIN TOWERS of the World Trade
Center gleam crimson in the otherworldly light

CAMILLE
Wow

KEN
Camille

CAMILLE

Look at this view

KEN
Were you listening to me

CAMILLE
Ken you’ve got to see this

Ken knits his brows as if to say “The view is not going
anywhere” But neither is Camille Ken rolls his eyes and
turns to look

But by now the gleaming Towers have receded out of view far
below Gone forever Leaving nothing but a dusky sky

KEN
Lovely Kosher champagne did you
get that

INT LIVERY CAB - WASHINGTON DC - MOVING - NIGHT

Stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic Ken is rushing through a
fast costume change in the back seat Luxury evening wear

KEN
How am I doing on time

CAMILLE
(checking her watch)
Right now she’s just going to make
you sleep on the couch but you’re
two stoplights away from a trial
separation
Out the window red brake lights as far as the eye can see

DRIVER
Sorry they got something going on
at the White House tonight

KEN
Just stop here

EXT PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - NIGHT

Car horns blare as Ken emerges into the thick of the traffic
jam Pulling on his coat shooting his cuffs Sharp He moves
to go But stops pats his pockets Something is missing

CAMILLE
Think fast

Ken spins back just in time to pluck a palm-sized jewelry
box from midair The earrings Camille winks

CAMILLE (CONTD)
Good luck

INT CITRONELLE BY MICHEL RICHARD - NIGHT

A vibrant 5-star hot spot abuzz with well-heeled VIPs
BUSINESS PEOPLE and POLITICOS Ken follows the MAITRE D’
through the crowded restaurant ricocheting from one table to
the next as he works the room with aplomb

KEN
Senator Congresswoman Justice

Ken may not hold a seat on the Hill but these people act
like they each owe him theirs

BUSBOY
Mr Feinberg

This last from a passing BUSBOY arms piled with dishes

BUSBOY (CONTD)
How you like them pinstripes sweeping
your hometown boys in Fenway

KEN
Just wait Chico Pedro’s coming
off the DL This is our year
(a beat to Maitre D’)
How long has she been waiting
MAITRE D’
Perhaps a half hour We explained
about the traffic And the

Bollinger is chilling

KEN
(producing jewelry box)
Great Bring it with this

MAITRE D’
Of course sir

And they have reached the threshold of a private area
MAITRE D’ (CONTD)
(with a flourish)
The Chef’s Table
But the table is abandoned

KEN
What happened to my wife

INT FEINBERG HOME - MASTER BATH - NIGHT

Meet DEDE FEINBERG Bryn Mawr elegance with a hint of the
pixie in her eye She is stunning in evening wear and pearls
Only right now she is also green to the gills and keeled
over the toilet retching violently

KEN
You should have seen the beltway I
wouldn’t be surprised if Camille
was still stuck in that taxi
Dede looks up long enough to roll her eyes

DEDE
Towel

Ken daubs her brow with a wet cloth Drizzling her dress

DEDE (CONTD)
Careful Ken

KEN
Sorry I’m sorry

Dede leans back against the cabinetry and for the first time
we notice that she is pregnant just beginning to show
DEDE
This can’t possibly be worth it

KEN
Happy anniversary

Dede looks up with a glare But Ken is holding out the pair
of Art Deco earrings And he was right Dede is floored

DEDE
These are just like the ones my mother
wore at her wedding How did you

Ken shrugs casually “Lucky guess”

INT PENN LAW SCHOOL - LECTURE HALL - DAY

Ken has just finished scrawling a question on the blackboard

in large block letters It reads “WHAT IS LIFE WORTH”
KEN
What Is Life Worth
(a beat)

Well Who can give us the answer
Awkward chuckles ripple the auditorium
KEN (CONTD)
(re SEATING CHART)
Mr Barron

A pudgy student (BARRON) stiffens in the front row

BARRON
Um

KEN
Tell us about yourself Benjamin

BARRON
About myself

KEN
Your life Skills dreams
accomplishments Who are you

BARRON
I was uh born in Wichita

The other students laugh as he squirms
KEN
Kansas boy Good Ever work on a farm

BARRON
My girlfriend’s uncle grew sorghum

KEN
Your girlfriend’s uncle Very good
(re seating chart)
Miss Politano

A prim student (POLITANO) in the middle

KEN (CONTD)
You are Mr Barron’s girlfriend’s uncle

Students laugh

KEN (CONTD)
Mr Barron has just been crushed
accidentally beneath an overturned
combine in your sorghum field

Ken aims a finger at another cowering student (DICKERSON)

KEN (CONTD)

Mr Dickerson will be your counsel

(another student)
and Miss Shapiro will represent
Amalgamated Caterpillar
manufacturer of the combine
harvester that just took poor Mr
Barron’s life in the Kansas State
civil action of “Mr Barron v Mr
Barron’s Girlfriend’s Uncle’s Farm
and the Caterpillar Company”

(a beat)
Ms Shapiro how much do you offer
Mr Dickerson to settle the case

SHAPIRO stammers
KEN (CONTD)
Let me rephrase How much is Mr

Barron’s life worth Give us a number

SHAPTRO
2 million

KEN
Mr Dickerson

BARRON
(objecting)
That’s ridiculous I’m in law
school I could be earning that
much a year by the time I’m 30

KEN
If you weren’t dead Unfortunately
they’re still picking bits of your
fingernails out of the sorghum and
this is now Mr Dickerson’s
decision Along with Miss
(re seating chart)
--Patel your bereaved mother

PATEL quickly chimes in with a counter-offer

PATEL
5 million

SHAPTRO
3 and a half

PATEL DICKERSON
Deal Deal

Barron frowns Ken shoots him a wink

JORDY Ken’s Teaching Assistant and a former student
herself begins to mouth along with the familiar speech

KEN
So you see you have not
accidentally stumbled into a
lecture on Philosophy 101 As far
as the law is concerned
(indicates blackboard

“What is Life Worth”)
-this is a practical question
The number is the job And as
lawyers it’s all we can do

INT PENN LAW SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Students flood from the auditorium lecture dismissed Ken is
already back to work cell phone at his ear briefcase in
hand He weaves through the crowd with purpose

KEN
(into phone)
Are we ready to roll calls

Ken stops short A pack of students blocks his path They are
crowded around the break room TELEVISION craning for a view

KEN (CONTD)
Pardon me Ms Patel this is a walkway

But Patel is glued to the set Ken pushes through annoyed

KEN (CONTD)
(into phone)
No let’s do it now I get no
reception on the train

Ken departs down the corridor But we linger with the crowd
catching a glimpse of the television that Ken ignored

FULL FRAME Archive news footage An iconic image The Twin
Towers of the World Trade Center stand tall above lower
Manhattan A wisp of smoke rises from the North Tower

CNN ANCHOR (ON TV)
This is a breaking story We have
unconfirmed reports that a small twin-
engine plane has crashed into one of
the towers of the World Trade Center

INT AMTRAK TRAIN - VIRGINIA - MOVING - DAY

John Coltranes A Love Supreme fills the SOUNDTRACK Ken
listens to the music on a pair of noise-dampening high-
fidelity headphones that drown out the workaday bustle all
around him like an invisible fortress of solitude

Green scenery blurs past the window but Ken’s eyes are shut
He is savoring the one peaceful moment of his day

SKRRRRREEEEEEEECH The train lurches to a halt heaving Ken
from his seat Baggage tumbles down from overhead

Panicked PASSENGERS clamber for the emergency exits
They speak into cell phones spread rumors by scuttlebutt We
can imagine what they must be saying But Ken can hear none
of it Only surreally Coltrane’s frenetic tenor sax
It takes a beat for Ken to remember the headphones

KEN

(tugging them off)
What’s going on

But the frenzy swirls heedlessly Offering only fragments
“two planes” “both towers” “under attack”

EXT RAILROAD TRACKS - VIRGINIA - DAY

The train has stopped between stations Passengers flood out
onto the tracks sweeping Ken along He struggles to fight
the current and loses hold of his briefcase which spills
open disgorging a plume of paperwork

Ken scrambles desperately to collect it Chasing his papers
through the mass hysteria up a scrub-grown knoll Until

The crowd falls silent
BLACK SMOKE swirls from the Pentagon just over the horizon

Ken’s papers flutter to the breeze He begins to register the
weight of the moment

INT US CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

Archive Footage to establish An emergency joint session of
Congress The mood is keyed with adrenaline and a sense of
urgency Lobbyists for the major AIRLINES are testifying

AIRLINE
What we’re facing is a national
transportation emergency Without
immediate Federal loan guarantees
and lawsuit suppression every
major airline at this table will be
forced into bankruptcy And these
murderers will have succeeded in
paralyzing American society

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY takes the floor

SENATOR KENNEDY
Thank you Mr May

Ken watches from the gallery He is accompanied by ERIC
MOGILNICKI Senator Kennedy’s Chief of Staff

MOGILNICKI
Sorry I didn’t call you back weve
been swamped in session all week
The airlines are peeing themselves
convinced they’re going to lose
their shirts to a class action by
the victims’ families

KEN
Did they do anything wrong

MOGILNICKI
(pointed)
Youre a lawyer does it matter

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE SENATOR CHUCK HAGEL

SENATOR HAGEL
I now cede the floor to Mr Leo
Boyle president of the Association
of Trial Lawyers of America

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE LEO BOYLE

BOYLE

Thank you Senator I’1ll make this
brief I am here to speak for the
victims of this tragedy because they
are not here to represent themselves
And I warn you saving the beleaguered
airlines may be our duty as patriots
restricting legitimate lawsuits by the
wounded families is not Doing so would
deny due process to the very citizens
most directly affected by these
attacks And that is un-American

(a beat)
If Congress intends to stop these people
suing it had better be prepared to
compensate their losses another way

This resonates through the chamber Ken follows keenly

SENATOR HAGEL
How much are we talking

BOYLE
Senator

SENATOR HAGEL
What you’re calling for - and the
lawyers in this chamber can help me -
sounds like government sponsored tort-
style compensation of the victims

BOYLE
Yes sir That is one solution

SENATOR HAGEL
That means adjudicating individual
award settlements for thousands of
separate claimants

BOYLE
A flat fee would be another option

Senator Hagel shakes his head facing the assembly

SENATOR HAGEL
I don’t know about the rest of my
colleagues Do you all want to put
a value on human life right now

Senators shift uneasily

SENATOR HAGEL (CONTD)
Because I don’t

BOYLE
The statute could appoint a Special
Master in charge of the Fund A
compensation czar if you will

The notion percolates Mogilnicki rolls a skeptical eye

MOGILNICKI
(under his breath)
Compensation czar More like “fall
guy” Jesus Christ I wouldn’t want
to be that poor sonofabitch

But Ken hears only “opportunity” His gears spinning

INT FEINBERG HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Dede and Ken eat dinner in silence at the kitchen counter A
small TELEVISION is tuned to CNN’s round-the-clock coverage

DEDE
Camille said you were on the Hill
today

Ken momentarily stiffens There is a tension in the air
something unspoken Something he is hoping to avoid

KEN
Just meeting Ted for lunch
DEDE
He must be a wreck They’ve been in
joint session all week

KEN
Mm
(changing the subject)
Did you reach your cousin in the City

DEDE
He was out of the office that day

KEN
Oh Thank god

DEDE
I told you that Last night

KEN
Right Sorry

KEN
This is delicious honey

DEDE
Thank god for what

KEN
Hm

DEDE
You said “thank god”

KEN
That Mark is safe

DEDE
That we didn’t know anyone

KEN
Well of course

DEDE
Because that would be a conflict of
interest

KEN

Right What
Dede stares bullets

DEDE
Jesus Ken Don’t tell me you
didn’t throw your hat in the ring
for that job The victim fund

KEN
Me No I haven’t even

(playing Devil’s Advocate)
Well for one thing the timing is
wrong You’re due in five months
and I’m

DEDE
-the most qualified torts lawyer
in the country And if anyone else
gets this job our daughter will be
a constant reminder of her father’s
one missed opportunity to wind up
in the history books

KEN
He won’t be a reminder

DEDE
She won’t have to be

hint of utter terror

INT DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - HALLWAY - DAY

Ken strides confidently down the hall adjusting his scales
of justice cuff links His handmade John Lobb wingtips click-
clack on the marble floor

INT DOJ - OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL - DAY
Behind the desk sits the man himself JOHN ASHCROFT

ASHCROFT
We must be very clear that the purpose
of this Fund is philanthropic A safety
net to help the victims move on with
their lives

KEN
And ignore the fact that we’re
giving the airlines a free pass

Ashcroft halts mid-gesture

KEN (CONTD)
You can speak frankly sir

ASHCROFT
(a beat sizing Ken up)
It is felt that for the Fund to be a
success no fewer than 80 percent of
the eligible families must opt in
voluntarily

KEN
That won’t be a problem
(a beat)
Though I happen to know the White
House told you to shoot for 75

ASHCROFT
(touché)
Call it my insurance policy

KEN
I’1l call it my quid to some future quo

ASHCROFT
I do admire a man with confidence
(perusing Ken’s RESUME)
(MORE )

ASHCROFT (CONTD)
Looking over your credentials -
national leader in mass torts
innovator in new techniques of
mediation alternative dispute
resolution You must be chomping
at the bit on this one

KEN
I just want to serve my country in
its time of need sir

ASHCROFT
A true patriot
(a beat testing)
Student of history too I’d
imagine And here you are with a
shot at making some Heck if I was
you Ken Id almost be excited

Ken nearly cracks a smile but holds his poker face passing
muster Ashcroft creaks back in his chair

ASHCROFT (CONTD)
There is one thing though Says
here you served two years as Chief
of Staff for Senator Kennedy If
I’m not mistaken the Senator is
still a Democrat Which would make
you a Democrat And Democrats you
may have noticed are not the
flavor of the season

KEN
Unless you mean hunting season

Ashcroft frowns

KEN (CONTD)
(changing tack)
I had hoped you would be gracious
enough to overlook that fact

ASHCROFT
No Ken you hoped Id realize I
dont have a choice A nation in
shock families in mourning and
everyone’s prying eyes right on us
looking for a solution that we
don’t got Heck this ain’t a
statute it’s a perfect storm
(a beat shrugs)
Luckily when it came to actual
numbers our noble representatives
on the Hill passed the buck
(MORE )

ASHCROFT (CONTD)
To one man a “Special Master” You
ever heard such a ridiculous title
Specially screwed

Ashcroft blows steam

ASHCROFT (CONTD)

If I pick an insider for that job a
party man friend of the President
That makes me the dumbest pig in the
poke Other hand I pick a Democrat
liberal credentials

(re resumé)
--12 pages long Well then my ass
might just get to keep this chair
If the Fund fails to soothe comfort
and ease the pain of these grieving
families it’s the Democrat’s fault
Then again if by a miracle you do
manage to pull this off

(a beat grins)
Don’t we look open-minded for
crossing the aisle to find you

Ken smiles demurely

ASHCROFT (CONTD)
Got any surprises for me

KEN
I want to do it for free

Squeezed into the space are the firm’s three-dozen ATTORNEYS
and twice as many PARALEGALS and support STAFF

Ken stands at the head of the gathering surrounded by the
handpicked team that will be working on the Fund They are

legal acumen is matched only by her shrewd common sense

glittering lights below His city

Whoa

Ken leaps to the desk and grabs the phone

The room falls silent All eyes are on Ken His are lit up

KEN (CONTD)
(into phone)
Yes sir

Ken notices that the room is focused on him He puts a
conspiratorial finger to his lips to signal “quiet” and hits
the “SPEAKER” button cuing the voice of the PRESIDENT

PRESIDENT (ON SPEAKER)
I want you to know you have our
full support But you’re taking the
heat on this thing Next time we
talk in public it’ll be at your
award banquet Or your funeral

INT KENNETH FEINBERG and ASSOCIATES - “WAR ROOM” —- DAY

The once sleek well-appointed conference room is now
cluttered with innumerable file boxes and document binders
Charts and calculation formulae paper the walls

A large map of Lower Manhattan has been delineated with tacks

and string The Fund Calendar is marked off with

‘Xs to

denote that 2 weeks have elapsed It is the tail end of a
logistics marathon Dawn breaks out the window Exhaustion

has set in

And no one has logged more hours than Ken He pages through a

fat 3-ring binder filled with column after column

of numbers

and statistics This is the “Presumptive Claims Formula”

The rest of the team awaits his verdict in suspense

KEN
We’re going to get some flack on
the proximity definition and for
leaving out mental anguish and
PTSD but other than that
(a beat finally)
It looks good

Sighs of relief satisfaction Camille remains dubious

CAMILLE
That sure is a lot of numbers
How much do you think it weighs

KEN
You think I wouldn’t rather keep it
simple We have to answer questions
our Congress never considered who
gets the money A spouse or a parent
A brother or a sister

DEBORAH
Then there’s fiancées Are they
entitled to anything Or same-sex
partners

KEN
Or how do we treat someone whose final
will and testament would bequeath 2
million dollars of the taxpayer’s money
to the Dog and Cat Museum
(a beat)
Simple is out of the question

CAMILLE
I’m just saying these are people
Not lawyers

KEN
Well that’s what we’re for
(standing)
I think we’re ready Good work ladies
Ken stands to go But Camille stays put

KEN (CONTD)
Is there a problem

CAMILLE
Nothing too big just who are they

KEN
Who are who

CAMILLE
The victims’ families The victims
Who are we supposed to contact

KEN
(not quite following)
What do you mean Don’t we have a list

Camille lifts a thick stack of papers

CAMILLE
Sure we have 10
(one after another)
Pentagon Airline flight
manifests Those are the easy ones
But the Towers

JORDY
All we have is piecemeal NYPD
Port Authority

CAMILLE
The firemen are still too busy
putting out the flames and picking
through the pile for pieces of their
own to return our phone calls

JORDY
And whatever records there were of
who passed security that morning

All gone

CAMILLE

No one even seems to know how many
names we’re looking for

INT GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL - DAY

The rush hour commute in the busiest terminal in the biggest
city in America Only right now you could hear a pin drop

Shell-shocked COMMUTERS gather around as if magnetized by
the giant wailing wall of 10 foot tall temporary bulletin
boards that spans the rotunda Every inch of the wall is
teeming plastered with handmade memorials and “Missing”
signs of the sort one usually posts for a runaway pet

Boughs of flowers in various stages of decay are clustered at
the base Tears flow freely among the various pilgrims who
have come to pay their respects This is our first glimpse of
the human cost

Moving amidst the crowd are Camille Jordy and Deborah Each
of them works a different section of the wall meticulously
copying every name and phone number onto an endless list

Their tears flow too Even as they wipe and fight them off
trying to do the job

INT FEINBERG HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The wee hours Miles Davis’ elegiac Sketches of Spain fills

the darkened room Ken sits on the floor an island in a sea
of paperwork He pores over the numbers just one more time

Until his eyelids droop

Ken jolts himself awake Deep breaths No time for sleep He
ups the volume on the stereo

INT FEINBERG HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

The MUSIC gets louder Dede muffles the sound with her
pillow 6 months pregnant Wide awake And all alone

INT NYC - STUYVESANT HIGH SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - DAY

The first town hall meeting People filter in A deeply
uncomfortable silence pervades the air

Camille mans reception at the door logging names onto the
ever growing list Each name corresponds to one of the three
hundred faces that fill the bleachers a crowd as diverse -
economically ethnically culturally - as America itself All
united and isolated by a shared yet un-sharable grief

Jordy moves solemnly from row to row passing out the
“Regulations” booklet But few seem to read it Mostly the
document is being rolled folded nervously toyed with At
best it is eyed with suspicion

Ken and Deborah regard the crowd from the stage

KEN
I thought we encouraged them to
bring lawyers

Even a cursory look tells us that few of them did so

DEBORAH
I made it clear top representation
was available at no cost
(a beat)
Sorry Ken

KEN
No problem It was the lawyers I
was afraid of How do I look

DEBORAH
Is that a rhetorical question

Ken smiles confidently and takes the podium The room falls
to a hush

KEN
Hello

SQUEEEEAK The microphone whines Ken jerks back

Jordy rushes up and adjusts the mic She taps it twice then
gives the thumbs up “good to go”

KEN (CONTD)
As some of you know my name is Kenneth
Feinberg and I’m here to explain how
the 911 Fund will work

WIDOWER (0S)
What’s this about life insurance

The impatient voice belongs to a blue-collar WIDOWER

KEN
If you please hold your questions
well allow plenty of time for
those later I think we should
start at the beginning

Ken displays a copy of the “Regulations”

KEN (CONTD)
I believe you’ve all been given a
copy of the basic procedures and
regulations for the Fund If you
turn to page ll

WIDOWER
It says here there’s a deduction
for life insurance

KEN
(sharp)
As I said there will be more time
for questions later But yes
claims will be offset in proportion
to external awards

WIDOWER
So you’re saying I get punished
because my wife planned ahead

KEN
That part of the regulations is
mandated by Congressional statute
and totally out of my control

WIDOWER
It ain’t fair

A disgruntled murmur ripples through the crowd

KEN
Please remember this Fund is meant to
provide a safety net not a fortune

This provokes a louder rumble A Latina WOMAN

WOMAN
You think we want a fortune

KEN
(backpedaling)
What I meant to

Ken seems frustrated with their inability to grasp the tenets
of the Fund But here the crowd’s patience expires The hall
erupts in a flurry of questions An elderly GRANDMOTHER

GRANDMOTHER
What about donations from my church

KEN
(flustered)
If you please raise your

A middle-class soccer MOM

MOM
This says awards will be based on
recorded earnings My son was a
first year associate but he was
promised a raise at Christmas

An African American FATHER

FATHER
Why shouldn’t everyone just be
given the same amount

A manual LABORER

LABORER
This is America they gotta save
the big bucks for the stockbrokers

A white-collar WIDOW takes offense

WIDOW
How dare you My husband worked 40
years to get where he was He’s
worth every penny they can afford

But now an Eastern European SISTER

SISTER
My brother mopped the halls what
about him

The crowd shatters into fractious bickering - the petty one-
upsmanship of grief A middle-aged HUSBAND

HUSBAND
These rules don’t say anything
about emotional suffering I was on
the phone with my wife when the
Tower fell I listened to her die

A retired FIREMAN

FIREMAN
My son gave his life to save people

Camille Deborah and Jordy look on helplessly

KEN
(trying to restore order)
Hey Quiet There will be a time anda
place for all your issues to be heard
The key now is to see the Fund for what
it is the only rational choice

But by now emotion has simmered to a boil

LABORER
Rational for them Here we are
arguing about money That’s their

plan Pay us off Shut us up When
the only real way to get at the
truth is to take them all to court

KEN
Listen I understand what you all
are going through

Wrong thing to say Camille Deborah and Jordy wince in
unison

WIDOWER
You understand

KEN
Please

The shout momentarily hushes the crowd

KEN (CONTD)

Now I know this program is not
business as usual But it is the
only real game in town And I am
sure that if we can settle down
raise our hands take turns and be
respectful towards each other

(a beat)
Well then we can make the best of
a bad situation and attempt to move
on with our lives

Silence Finally Ken collects himself ready to move on

CHARLES WOLF
This is not a game Mr Feinberg

The statement comes from a dignified silver-haired
gentleman Soft-spoken but with a quiet intensity A man we
will come to know as CHARLES WOLF

The entire crowd murmurs in accord It is the first time
weve seen them agree on anything And their common bond now
amounts to a shared resentment of the man on stage

CHARLES WOLF (CONTD)
To you this may be business To
me it’s my wife

Hello Nice to meet you Mr

Joe I’m afraid I’m running late
for a flight If you have any
questions though

ROUGHNECK
I lost two cousins

KEN
I I’m truly sorry

ROUGHNECK

How did I know the lawyer they’d
send would come along with a name
like Feinberg

Excuse me

But with that the man is gone Vanished into the crowd

The Bodyguard hustles out to follow

It’s okay I can take it from here

follows anyway Ken pauses to object

BODYGUARD

INT FULD HOME - DEN - DAY

Wood paneling Law books line the shelves A framed gavel and
other laurels tell us this is the inner sanctum of “Chief
Judge Stanley H Fuld of the NY State Court of Appeals”

Long since retired JUDGE FULD is sharing a snifter of brandy
and a Cuban cigar with Ken his sullen beleaguered protégé
Fuld peers out the shuttered window where the Bodyguard
stands sentinel on the porch

JUDGE FULD
Afraid I’m going to plunge a knife
in your back Ken

KEN
You should have seen these people
judge They were like a pack of
wolves baying for my blood

JUDGE FULD
Come here to whine did you

KEN
(a beat suitably scolded)
No I’1l just drink my drink thank you

Fuld settles into a leather chair He swirls his brandy

JUDGE FULD
I ever tell you the story of
Richard Bland Lee

KEN
I probably wasn’t listening

JUDGE FULD
Top lawyer in the country about
190 years ago Titan in his field
Thomas Jefferson once called him
“the wisest man south of the
James” Sound familiar

KEN
Jefferson I think I’ve heard of him

JUDGE FULD
Well as far as anyone could see
Richard Lee was America’s chosen
son And young Richard he’d be the
first to claim the prize
(a beat pointed)
How’s that for familiar

Ken shrugs

JUDGE FULD (CONTD)
Anyway it’s 1816 and Richards
boyhood pal James Madison appoints
him chief commissioner to adjudicate
claims arising out of the loss and
destruction of life and property
during the War of 1812

And now this does sound familiar Ken perks accordingly

JUDGE FULD (CONTD)
Deeply moved by the peoples’
considerable losses - not to
mention fearful of being run out of
town on a rail - Richard comported
himself generously

(a beat translating)

He gave away a lot of money

KEN
And

JUDGE FULD

Poor Richard wound up lambasted in
the press Persona non grata on the
Hill Ruined his career No more
than a tragic footnote to the
history of this great land

(a beat)
Which is how come you never heard of him

Ken deflates Not quite the encouragement he had anticipated

KEN
You’re telling me not to be
generous

JUDGE FULD

No Being generous just ruined
Richard’s career Imagine what
might have become of the rest of
him if he’d have been stingy

(a beat)
Besides I didn’t say he didn’t do
the right thing

KEN

But the public wasn’t happy
JUDGE FULD

Nope
KEN

And the families weren’t grateful

JUDGE FULD
They gave lives and got money
Would you be

KEN
So I’m damned either way

JUDGE FULD
No good deed goes unpunished Ken

KEN
Is that supposed to make me feel better

JUDGE FULD
By no means
(sits forward)
It’s supposed to remind you this has
nothing to do with your feelings

Hold on Ken The backhanded pep talk sinks in

KEN
(shrugs matter-of-factly)
Frankly I think we have no excuse
not to hit 95

DEBORAH

KEN
We’re giving out millions of
dollars tax free

This isn’t about the money Ken
Didn’t you see those people We’re
being driven by a fucking

doubt the survivors and families
victimized by the attacks of September
11th will soon rally to the Fund They
May never be ‘satisfied’ Who would

choice and accept the extraordinary
generosity of a united nation that
shares their grief’”

Anger erupts Ken steels himself riding it out Until

CHARLES WOLF

Let the man speak

The same soft-voiced silver-haired gentleman The crowd
simmers down This man commands respect

KEN
Thank you

VOICE
You’re an asshole

Charles Wolf shoots a look in the direction of the voice but
whoever it was has backed down Wolf gives Ken the nod

KEN
I I want to apologize to those
of you here that attended the last
session I was flustered What I
meant to express the truth of it
is that I don’t know what you are
going through But I am here on
behalf of the people of the United
States to offer our help to you in
this terribly painful time

This resonates

My brother too Nicholas We
were in the same ladder company

Is he here

But Frank’s grim look answers the question

KEN (CONTD)
I’m very sorry

FRANK
We got separated when the first
tower went I was out on the curb
with this leg so I didn’t see him
But the captain said he went back
into the other building to help

KEN
That takes a hero

FRANK

Yeah Only it wasn’t any use I
mean the engineers and stuff knew
that second one was coming down
They told the PD to give an evac
order and everything I was trying
to relay to Nick but our radios
They stink Hardly even work in
high-rise buildings if you can
believe that In New York City

KEN
I had no idea

FRANK

(working up steam)
Oh that’s just it The public
never does But they knew all about
it City Hall the FD brass All
those suits We been filing reports
for years but you can guess where
they tell us to shove ‘em

By now Frank is red in the face the frustration unbearable

So you see that’s That’s why it
happened so bad like it did
Negligence Top down

Cheap fucking negligence And
Nick and a whole bunch of other
boys - good brave boys They’re
gone for nothing

Frank wipes tears with thick fingers sniffling it back

KEN
I didn’t know any of that

FRANK
I want the world to know it

KEN
I understand

FRANK
I want when you file your report
or whatever you make sure that
story is in there You make sure
they change things so it don’t
happen again Can you do that

about protection We can’t leave Ken
exposed like that do you understand

by several supporters Faces we recognize from the town hall
meetings The most relevant for our purposes being Frank
Abate He wears full FDNY regalia and a bitter scowl

CHARLES WOLF (ON TV)
The statute itself is flawed at the
core providing for no judicial
review or Congressional oversight
which makes Mr Feinberg judge
jury and executioner

KEN
This man has no clue

But worst of all is his manner He
has been patronizing manipulative
and at times even cruel He has
lost his composure on several
occasions demonstrating serious
lapses in judgment

light candles all around the house and
make this amazing turkey meatball lasagna

there is a minimum of 400000 dollars
And like I say that’s before

Well not right now of course

Panicking Ken tears through the house until

He stops Dede is fast-asleep on the couch Ken’s noise-
dampening headphones cover her ears

KEN (CONTD)
(relieved)
There you are

Ken’s panic subsides Yet a quiet terror lingers in his stare
as he watches Dede her belly his child their future

SOUND FADES to silence Then the voice of a VICTIM
VICTIM 1 (VO)
Jill was due in March A baby girl
I lost them both Just like that

BEGIN MONTAGE --

Of Dede’s pregnancy Various brief scenes but no sound The
the voices of VICTIMS are all that Ken can hear

-- The Ultrasound The developing FETUS 10 fingers 10 toes
Dede glows touching the baby’s hand with hers

VICTIM 2 (VO)
They asked me if James wore a wedding
ring I said “Always why” Because all
they could find was his left hand

Ken is haunted

-- The baby shower Dede and her friends squeal as she
unwraps a pair of adorable footed pajamas

VICTIM 3 (VO)
I heard women screaming in the
background This alarm kept repeating
“Please evacuate the building” And Amy
she had such a sense of she actually
laughed “I think I know I have to get
out of the damn building”

Ken forces a smile
-- The delivery room NURSES administer to Dede

was another man We spent 4 days
praying for a stranger

Dede squeezes Ken’s hand and the BABY is born Ken tears up

I used to have a very strong faith
in God but how can I accept this

-- A few months older Leslie wriggles belly-up on a baby
blanket Dede tickles her laughing

floor and says “Mommy I’m playing
dead so I can be with my Daddy”

Leslie’s joyful innocent eyes find Ken He has to look away

-- Leslie’s 1st birthday The family celebrates including
David his wife and their children We’1l meet them later
For the moment what matters is the person missing
VICTIM 7 (VO)
We used to travel as a family All
around the world Now I live in
fear for the girl I have left

Ken watches the celebration from the back of the room Fear
in his eyes Isolated utterly from their joy

VICTIM 7 (VO) (CONTD)
And every sudden sound I hear I’m sure
that’s it I’m going to lose her too

His cell phone vibrates on the counter

The desk abounds with a cornucopia of human relics The
STENOGRAPHER clatters along as a FIANCEE relates her tale
Ken listens intently

FIANCEE
Only the weekend before it happened we
spent Labor Day at his folks’ place on
the Island Cyndi and I tried to churn
ice cream but it came out all mushy

Ken allows a prudently measured smile

FIANCEE (CONTD)
My own mom and I aren’t close and I
never really had a dad I remember
feeling for the first time ever like
this is what it means to have parents

(wistful)

It was almost like that was reason
enough right there to start a
life with Chris I even teased him
about it after Like I was
marrying him to get to his folks

She giggles through the veil of tears But Ken restrains his
own He knows these stories never have a happy ending

KEN
Now they won’t return your calls

The Fiancée nods stifling a sob

KEN (CONTD)
Their attorney forwarded me a copy
of the letter

FULL FRAME In Ken’s hand a New York attorney’s letterhead
We make out the phrase “CEASE AND DESIST” Along with “THE
VICTIM PHONED HIS PARENTS REPEATEDLY IN THE DAYS PRIOR TO THE
EVENT INFORMING THEM OF HIS PLANS TO CANCEL THE WEDDING”

FIANCEE
(heartsick)
They say Chris told them he was having
second thoughts but it isn’t true Why
would they say that I don’t even care
about the money

KEN
I don’t think it is the money

FIANCEE
I just want us to face this together

KEN
(feeling her pain)
Maybe losing Chris is so hard they
can’t bear to admit they lost so
much more Not just their son but
the husband he would have been The
father You

Ken sees the Fiancée’s lips quiver the tell-tale sign of an
imminent breakdown He tries to distract her

Why don’t you tell me how you two
met A frat party wasn’t it

Ken pulls David into the office and slams the door

David stops cold as he sees the burn victim (SARAH) slumped
in a wheelchair A young lady but her face so scarred beyond
recognition that it would be impossible to tell She is
flanked by a West Indian CAREGIVER

on David is still shaking from the punishment

KEN
You think she’s in it for a payday too

DAVID
(spins fuming)
You sick fuck You think sitting through

KEN
This isn’t about what I am

DAVID
You’re a bully

KEN
I’m trying to show you these people
are human beings David not all
checkcashers looking for handouts
from the treasury

DAVID

They’re not all martyrs either
And you being one too isn’t going
to save them You think if you take
enough punishment it makes you one
of them but you’re wrong

(a beat annihilating)
You can’t ever take enough for that

is John Ashcroft He notices Sarah wheeled out of the office

How much did he get

I heard they claim to be something
like 3500 families strong

I’m confident the hearings are
having a positive effect

Ashcroft cocks a dubious eyebrow

ASHCROFT

Been almost 2 years And 3500 families
that’s almost two thirds Now Ken I
got all the faith in the world in you
but let’s just say some folks I know are
starting to get nervous

I need something from you here

6 weeks is a long time Most people can
afford to hold out hedge their bets
Once they’re forced to choose they’1l
come around You don’t have to worry

It’s the only rational thing to do

I don’t have to worry Then how come

straighten up The girls are with
my aunt and it’s the only time I
can get any sewing done

Can I get you a pop Maybe
something harder

MARIE
Oh he won’t be here ‘til 430

(checking his watch)
Am I early I was sure Camille told me 4

MARIE
Oh Must be a mix-up Here sit down I
made gingerbread

Ken grudgingly takes a seat at the cramped kitchen table
Marie slides into the chair beside his a little too close

MARIE (CONTD)
I hope Vic told you I don’t want to
cause any pain for that family

KEN
He mentioned that
(a beat)
As far as you know Nick never told
Karen about your relationship

MARIE
Oh no He wouldn’t do that Nick was
real clear about our arrangement

KEN
Your arrangement

MARIE
(defensive)

He didn’t support me or nothing
Just the girls

KEN
So you actually planned to have
children together

MARIE

Planned Oh no that was definitely an
accident But once it happened
Well we’re Catholic you know I
mean Nick was I’m more “cafeteria
style” like they say

(a beat)
I guess you could say the whole
baby thing just landed on my tray
Two helpings

Marie smiles at the turn of phrase Ken does not

MARIE (CONTD)

To tell the truth we did consider the
other option at first Nick even drove
me to a clinic way out in Jersey But
both of us we just couldn’t

(a beat)
Anyways Nick promised to help and
he was good to his word That was
Jenna she’s our first

KEN
And your second

MARIE

least we didn’t try to stop it I guess
once we started what’s one more

Karen

MARIE

Nick never told me her name She
never even knew he worked nights at
the scrap yard That’s the only money
that went to us because he didn’t
want it to “come out of their
mouths” That’s how he said it

(a beat awkwardly)
Can I pour you some tea

KEN
No thank you

MARIE
You know with Nick gone that makes me
the breadwinner for all three of us

works 50 grand per kid right But the

MARIE

Yeah That’d be the wife Karen
She gets the rest

KEN

That’s right yes

(back to terra firma)
Dependent awards can be adjusted
somewhat According to circumstances
But the bulk of the claim does belong
to the legal heir It’s hers to
distribute as she sees fit

MARIE
Yeah That’s the thing I mean
I’m a single mother now

KEN
You were always a single mother
Miss Valens

This is harsh But Marie has a tougher shell than it looks

MARIE
I just thought if you heard my
story Well I thought you might try
to help You know break the news to
Mrs Abate See if she might be
(laying a hand on Ken’s)
willing to share

Ken hardly has a moment to react before Marie is up close
MARIE (CONTD)
That’s why I’m so glad you came out
here a little early see

Her fingers toy with the laces of her bodice-style blouse

KEN
I think I really should be

MARIE
Let me pour you some tea

Marie leans across the table breasts inches from Ken’s nose
The bodice thread comes loose a breast droops out
becoming overtly visible

KEN
Oh my god No

Ken shoves back in his chair Marie covers up mortified
BBBBRRRZZZZZZZT The doorbell rings

Marie rushes to answer it re-threading her blouse Ken
hastily gathers his things making for the door himself

appointment and I’m running late

EXT QUEENS TRIPLEX - DAY

Ken walks briskly towards his rental car Alexander dogs him
close behind

ALEXANDER
Before you go I need some
assurance that Miss Valens can
anticipate fair consideration

KEN
Mrs Abate is her husbands primary
beneficiary Your client is entitled to
100000 dollars for the two children

ALEXANDER
(objecting)
This is a case with extraordinary
circumstances

KEN
And I can probably tack on another
50000 but

Alexander catches up to Ken The two men walk side by side

ALEXANDER
Twice that amount would still fall
considerably short Mr Feinberg Even
to see the girls through high school

KEN
I’m afraid there’s nothing more I can do

ALEXANDER
I happen to know that Mrs Abate’s
brother-in-law is allied with Charles
Wolf No one in that family has any
intention of joining the Fund

KEN

I’m confident that she will
ALEXANDER

My client would be entitled to her award
KEN

I couldn’t transfer a claim without
ALEXANDER

Consent

(a beat)

That’s what I’m asking for I
assume you’re headed there now

Ken stops They have reached the car

ALEXANDER (CONTD)

I would ask that you inform Mrs Abate
of the situation as soon as possible
Otherwise as much as I would hate to
bring any more pain to a grieving widow
I will be forced to do it myself

(staunchly)
Miss Valens deserves security for her
family’s future

A beat Alexander has Ken pegged And cornered

KEN
Stay away from that family

ALEXANDER
You have my word If I have yours

Alexander extends a conciliatory hand Ken merely stares

at city hall I told Nick I didn’t

prove he loved me but he liked to
do things “the right way” He
pulled double shifts for 5 months
Wouldn’t take a dime from my folks

You better go mind the boys Karen
They’re into the pots and pans

KAREN
(rolls her eyes)
One thing they don’t warn you about when
you have kids The only effective way to
childproof a house is to wear a condom

And she’s off to be a mom Leaving Frank alone with Ken
An arctic chill between them

FRANK
What are you doing here

KEN
I was in town I wanted Karen to see
the award calculation

Ken unfolds it from his pocket If that was his reason for
coming it took him an awful long time to get around to it

KEN (CONTD)
Presumptive of course
(a beat translating)
That is not final

FRANK
I know what it means to presume

Frank snatches the paper eyeing it mistrustfully From
elsewhere in the house the clang and clatter of pots and
pans mix with children’s laughter and Karen’s muted voice

KEN
Frank can I ask you a question
You and Nick were very close

FRANK
My kid brother

KEN
I assume you’d know if there was
anything I don’t know something
he wouldn’t necessarily tell Karen
(a beat how to say this)
Like hidden relations

FRANK
All my brother’s relations are
under this roof That’s them
banging away over your head

KEN
Well see the reason I ask is

But Ken stops He hasn’t got the nerve to say it Yet there
is something in Frank’s stare to suggest he doesn’t have to

FRANK
(too firmly)
My brother was a family man Mr
Feinberg We’re not signing anything

KEN
Karen is going to have to put food
on the table Frank send the boys
to college

FRANK
Nick died because people like you held
the purse strings Now you think you
can make it right by taking a few
hours out of your busy schedule to
toss money on his grave

Frank tosses the claim papers to Ken’s feet

Don’t get me wrong these one-on-

Define “no one”

And by now they have reached their destination Jordy
unlocks the door of a walk-in file closet

INT KENNETH FEINBERG and ASSOCIATES - FILE CLOSET - DAY

A small room with a tiny table and a single chair The walls
are lined from top to bottom with steel file cabinets

JORDY
The drawers marked green are the ones
weve signed About 1800 families

Jordy indicates a row of 5 drawers marked green On the
opposite wall over a dozen other drawers are marked red

JORDY (CONTD)
That leaves approximately 3600
still uncommitted 99 percent of
whom are seriously considering
legal action

Oof

CAMILLE
On the bright side only 98 percent
of them still blame you

JORDY
The good thing is they have a leader

Jordy slaps a thick file into Ken’s hands “CHARLES WOLF”

JORDY (CONTD)
He requested a face-to-face

KEN

Fly him down I’1l hear him out

DEBORAH
It’s not that simple

JORDY
He’s got major problems with our numbers

KEN
This isn’t about numbers these families
want to be heard

All except for one at the bottom This drawer is marked in

gray It reads “HOLDOUTS” Intrigued Ken opens the drawer
and withdraws its contents A thin stack of case files Ken
opens the top folder “GRISELDA SOTO”

This is an 80-year-old woman on a
fixed income whose son and primary
caretaker died in the attacks She
won’t take our money she won’t sue

DEBORAH
She’s 80 years old

KEN
And she’s got no one left Go worry
about a lawsuit I’ve got a stack of men
and women here who are doing nothing

DEBORAH
Ken you can’t force every person

KEN
My mandate is to help these people

Deborah smacks the files out of Ken’s hands cutting him
short The papers scatter across the floor

DEBORAH
Your mandate was to bring this in at
75 percent But you had to be a hero
and bank our careers on 90
(a beat sinking in)

That’s right Not just yours And I
think at this point we’d all be
happy to settle for breaking 50

KEN
Screw the numbers

Heads turn in adjoining offices

KEN (CONTD)
To hell with checking these people off
a list just so they stay out of court
and keep their mouths shut long enough
for a photo op with the American flag

DEBORAH
Youre way out of line Ken This
isn’t hush money and you know it

KEN
It is if we’re too afraid to listen

Ken collects the “HOLDOUT” files from the floor

KEN (CONTD)

Let them sue Anyone who turns down 2
million dollars tax free in favor of a
go-nowhere lawsuit does it because they
have something they need to say and
because saying it is the only way they
can find to move on with their lives

of a shaved head sunglasses a glint of metal in hand

don’t mind her staying

tried listening About their lives
about what they lost Two years of this
They’re the ones in grief but half the
time I’m paralyzed What do I say I
just sit there Like a fucking sponge

Youre doing everything right

KEN
Well it’s not working

Ken shoves the files away splashing his whiskey The amber
liquid seeps into the paperwork Like a sponge David pulls
the files out of the spilt whiskey Drying them

Tell me Dave What can I do

DAVID
Do what you do better than anyone

KEN
I’m a calculator

need someone who can sit there and take

FULL FRAME The speech Paragraphs of text separated by
charts from the corresponding slide presentation It reads
“T AM HERE TO PRESENT THE REVISED CLAIMS CALCULATION”

KEN (CONTD)
(reading)
I am here today

Ken stops All the faces in the crowd Ken lowers the speech

KEN (CONTD)
Mr Abate is right I don’t deserve
your trust

The chattering stops The team shares a worried look

KEN (CONTD)

Most people only agree to trust me on
judge’s orders For you an act of
Congress The only person who does
seem to trust me on a daily basis is
my wife don’t ask me why and my
daughter Leslie But she’1l learn
better just as soon as she can talk

This garners a few snickers in the crowd

KEN (CONTD)
really here today to tell you
a jerk
(off Dede)
And one lucky jerk at that One
with a beautiful wife and a baby
And a brother and a family that puts
up with me I work hard but I’ve
had every advantage I earn a living
that puts me in the upper class of
the wealthiest nation in the world
But don’t get me wrong I’m still
complaining None of that ever
stopped me from wanting more
Because I’m a lucky American jerk

(a beat)
Most of you were too
(MORE )

KEN (CONTD)

Your lives changed mine didn’t Me
and a lot of others We know nothing
about your loss And I hope to god
we never do But I will tell you
this If Leslie ever came home from
the playground with so much as a
hangnail or a chipped tooth at
somebody else’s hand and the
government sent some heartless jerk
up on stage offering to bring me
“justice” telling me what I ought to
do how I ought to “act sensibly” and
“move on”

(gaining steam)
Well I’d give that jerk a piece of
my mind Maybe Id take his money
maybe I’d demand more Probably I’d
just tell him where to stick it
Because I don’t care what he had to
give me it could be all the money
in the world It could never be
nearly enough

A long beat Silence
DEBORAH
(stunned)

That was different

Ken offers Wolf a heartfelt nod then grabs his coat
descends the stage walks up the aisle and out the door

CAMILLE
Where the hell is he going

Dede smiles proudly knowing

EXT STATEN ISLAND NEIGHBORHOOD - ABATE HOME - NIGHT
Ken mounts the front porch steeled and determined

FRANK (0C)
She ain’t home

Ken jolts A point of flame flares in the darkness Frank
shifts in the shadows creaking the rusted porch swing

FRANK (CONTD)
Kids are asleep Karen and Irene
are having a girls’ night

He aims his cigarette at an identical tract HOME across the
way Through the lit kitchen window Karen and IRENE ABATE
are visible gossiping gaily

KEN
Is that your house My brother and
I are neighbors too

Frank blows smoke

FRANK
I don’t know what kind of lawyer
talk you put in Wolf’s ear but you
can put it away And the checkbook
too We’re fighting for Nick

KEN
I can accept that

FRANK
But you think you know better For
Karen anyways And the boys

KEN
I wouldn’t presume

FRANK
You think she’s not strong enough
Or too strong You see her being
loyal to a dead man and you can’t
understand why

KEN
It’s not my place to understand Or
judge anyone Mrs Abate needs to
do what she thinks is right

FRANK
(sizing Ken up suspiciously)
She will do that No need for you to
keep dropping by stirring shit up

KEN
The Fund ends tomorrow This is the
last you’ll see of me

FRANK
Well that’s the first thing out of
your mouth I can honestly say I’m
happy to hear

KEN
But

Frank creaks forward in the swing darkening

FRANK
But what

KEN
There’s something Mrs Abate has to
hear first Before she does
whatever she thinks is right

FRANK
Oh

Frank stands coming face to face with Ken imposing

FRANK (CONTD)
Well like I said her and Irene are
busy for the night So you can tell
me and I’ll pass it along

KEN
Id rather tell this to Karen in person

FRANK
We don’t have any secrets in this
family Mr Feinberg Whatever it
is you can tell it to me

KEN
(a beat)
I don’t think I have to I think
you already know

Frank shoves past Ken into the house

INT ABATE HOME - FOYER - NIGHT
Ken follows Frank through the door

KEN
Frank

FRANK
Nick was loyal to this family

KEN
This isn’t about Nick

FRANK
He was loyal to me
(face to face heated)
He went back into that tower for me
(MORE )

FRANK (CONTD)
You know that I didn’t tell you that
part For all I know he heard the call
to evacuate and said “Fuck it my
brother Frank’s in there I’m going
in” Meantime I was too busy sitting
on my ass fiddling with a radio

Frank heaves All the rage bitterness aimed inward now

FRANK (CONTD)

You think because he made mistakes I
dont owe him Karen don’t owe him
Everyone does things they ain’t proud
of maybe some of us even make a
habit of it

(searching)
What if you croaked tomorrow You got
a family What’s your secret What’s
the worst thing they’d find out
Maybe sometimes you were just looking
out for number one no holy motives
Every once in a while on a full
moon say When you weren’t out
there being a hero

KEN
I’m no hero

FRANK
Yeah but you’re no devil either
Those things you do those selfish
things they may make you ashamed
they may even keep you up at night
crying to your own brother
(a beat)
That’s right Mr Feinberg Nick
wasn’t proud of it But I told him
then what I’m telling you
(grabbing Ken tears falling)
Those things don’t make you who you
are Nick was a good man He was a
family man He just loved so much

Ken is deeply moved But he must stay on track

KEN
Nick would want his children taken
care of All of them He wouldn’t
put himself above that Because that
kind of mistake that does make you
who you are

(a beat)

The other family will be joining the
Fund as full beneficiaries

(MORE)

KEN (CONTD)
I would rather Karen doesn’t find out
when she reads it in the report

Frank swallows hard He nods “I’1ll tell her”

KAREN (0C)
What are their names

FRANK
Karen

Frank wheels around to see Karen in the doorway She keeps
her gaze on Ken abandoning Frank to his guilt

KEN
Jenna and Belle

A long beat Crushed But somehow stoic

KAREN
He always wanted girls

Her sheer calm is shattering Ken toughs it out

KEN
(producing a CLAIMS FORM)
The information is all filled out This
isn’t a hard sell but if do you change
your mind I can bend the rules and
make you both full beneficiaries

Ken sets the form on a stand by the door avoiding Karen’s
eye knowing it would be the end of him He departs

INT KENNETH FEINBERG and ASSOCIATES - “WAR ROOM” —- DAY

3 days to go The whole firm is assembled ready to process a
last-minute flood of applications The big board reads

3325 JOINED 2125 REMAIN 61”

INTERN
Mail’s here

The room takes a collective deep breath as an INTERN rushes
in trailed by the African-American dreadlocked MAIL WOMAN

MAIL WOMAN
Who wants to sign for these

She holds up maybe 20 Express Mail envelopes That’s it
Deborah Jordy Camille and Ken exchange a glum look

DISSOLVE TO

2 days left The board tally has climbed by a digit “62”
The firm waits in tense silence as the Mail Woman returns

A dozen more envelopes
DISSOLVE TO

The calendar is ‘X’ed out Deadline day The rest of the firm
has been dismissed Only the stalwart team remains

The board still reads “62” A death knell

Ken squeaks back in his chair and stands He walks out The
ladies exchange a look

CAMILLE
Bathroom break

JORDY
Maybe he’s hiding 2000 families in there

The ladies laugh enjoying a moment of levity all the strain
and frustration temporarily abated The Mail Woman enters
The ladies instantly clam up hopeful

The Mail Woman sets a bundle of about two dozen envelopes
onto the table Better than nothing but the ladies can’t
help but deflate Failure

The Mail Woman looks to the door where another MAIL WORKER
wheels in a handtruck stacked with bins stuffed with Express
Mail envelopes

DEBORAH
Are these all Oh my god

MAIL WOMAN
I got you 5 more bins in the truck

The mail workers brush past Ken in the doorway

CAMILLE
Ken look

Ken drops his jaw He quickly helps the ladies unload and
sort the hundreds of applications Not quite relieved

KEN
We’re not even close to 80

DEBORAH
But it’s a good dent

FRANK (0S)
Looks like this is the place to be

Frank teeters anxiously at the door clutching a claims form
Ken looks up surprised to see him Pleased

CAMILLE
(skimming Frank’s form)
This all appears to be in order Can
I get you anything coffee a bagel
Frank takes in the “War Room” The sudden activity Success

FRANK
Better hit the road

KEN
(stopping him)
What about
FRANK
(shakes head apologetic)
She’s her own person

Ken fades

KEN
I’m glad you came

INT OFFICE BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY
Ken is seeing Frank out They stand in an awkward silence

FRANK
You’re from Boston right

KEN
Brockton Mass

FRANK
You hear the Sox just signed Schilling

KEN
It’s our year

FRANK
Ha Keep dreaming

Their eyes meet Nothing operatic just mutual respect

INT OFFICE BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY
The elevator doors slide open Ken and Frank emerge

LIEUTENANT (0S)
Mr Feinberg

A uniformed Navy LIEUTENANT with a missing arm and a dozen
other men and women have been waiting for the elevator

LIEUTENANT (CONTD)
Thank you

He puts his application into Ken’s hand The other families
follow about half of them military One by one piling Ken’s
arms with applications Presently several more families
enter the lobby Few of them we recognize Ken knows them
all and addresses each by name No monumental words are
exchanged but none need to be

Their eyes express appreciation for Ken’s efforts for his
hard work for his respect But mostly for leaving the
choice up to them Ken’s eyes well with humility

At the doors a FEDEX MESSENGER struggles to wheel in a dolly
stacked high with boxes of applications

INT KENNETH FEINBERG and ASSOCIATES - “WAR ROOM” - NIGHT
The team feverishly processes applications

JORDY
I can’t feel the ends of my fingers

CAMILLE
And there’s another hundred in the
stack at least

DEBORAH
Should we wake the President

JORDY
Let’s get drunk

DEBORAH
Let’s get drunk in the morning
Right now I just want to sleep

CAMILLE
Here here

KEN
All right call it a night I’1l
lock up Good

ALL
(cutting him off)
Good work ladies

Exhilarated exhausted laughter all around The ladies gather
their things Ken embraces each as they depart Deborah
last They share a smile of deep affection gratitude Yet
something in Ken’s eyes belies his satisfaction

DEBORAH
I know Not all of them

Ken ambles slowly to his dark office

INT KENNETH FEINBERG and ASSOCIATES - KEN’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Ken is left alone at his desk lost in a clutter of memory
and memorabilia Pictures fishing flies and tiny sailboats

KAREN (0C)
Nick Jr thought I should add this
to the collection
Karen enters with Nick’s tattered baseball mitt
KEN
(shocked hopeful)

Please sit down

Karen remains standing

KAREN
Deborah let me in Congratulations
(a beat)

Did they come

The other family Ken changes the subject

KEN
You make sure to thank Nicky for the
glove

KAREN

Are they beautiful

Ken balks But this is what she’s come for

KAREN (CONTD)
I’m sorry for them Nick would have
been a great dad for girls I
didn’t know they were girls
(a beat)
I didn’t want to know

And there it is Karen knew about Marie All along

KAREN (CONTD)

Nick used to slip out after dinner
There’d be a phone call He’d say
“That was Frank there’s a 3-alarm in
the city” With the boys we needed
all the overtime he could rack up so
Id kiss him goodbye Pretend I
couldn’t smell he was lying What
kind of firefighter wears aftershave
to a 3-alarm blaze

(a beat)
Then I’d be over with Irene Frank
would come stumbling in after a few
beers I’d say “How’d it go with the
3-alarm” He’d look at me know
immediately and with the straightest
face you ever saw go “Nicky’s just
mopping up He was a real hero
tonight You should have seen him May
be awhile though Don’t wait up”

(a beat swallowing pain)
I don’t hate him for that That was
the code I don’t hate Nick either
I never wanted

Karen chokes up wiping tears Ken helps her into a seat

KEN
Of course not

KAREN

But that woman I used to think about
her I used to think if those 3-
alarms If one of them turned out to
be real And she Well that’d be it
New York City would quit catching fire
after every Abate family dinner and
Id have my husband back The boys
would have their dad

(stifling a sob)
I wished her dead That was me

KEN
You didn’t do this Karen

KAREN
God tests us

KEN
What happened to Nick had nothing to do

KAREN
(standing to go)
I can’t take the money

KEN
It’s not on you

KAREN
I can’t

KEN
(grabbing her)
Wait Do you hear me

KAREN
I’m sorry I’m so sorry

Ken holds her close
KEN
This is not on you
INT OFFICE BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Karen dabs bloodshot eyes as Ken sees her to the elevator
She produces the rumpled claims form from her purse

KAREN
(shaking her head)
Sorry
KEN

Karen please it’s not too
She hands him the wadded up paper The doors slide shut

KEN (CONTD)
-late

Ken fades crumpling the form But stops He sees something

FULL FRAME The balled up form One line is visible A
signature “KAREN ABATE”

Ken freezes Then leaps into action

INT KENNETH FEINBERG and ASSOCIATES - “WAR ROOM” - NIGHT
Ken rummages the applications on the conference table
finding the rubber “TIME RECEIVED” stamp Ken thumbs the
adjustable wheel literally turning back the clock He inks
the stamp and brands Karen’s claim “RECEIVED”

Ken tucks the form in amidst the pile and stands back

INT FEINBERG HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house is dark The television plays softly Ken enters
quietly shedding his coat at the door About to collapse
onto the sofa Ken notices Dede fast asleep Leslie in her
arms A tender smile graces his eyes

FULL FRAME On TV Archive News Footage Iraq Guantanamo
Orange Alerts A nation no longer at peace

Ken shuts it off His war is over
Careful not to wake Dede Ken curls onto the couch beside
her He slides a gentle arm around her body and his

daughter’s And lays there like this a long beat

His eyes are bloodshot spent but he holds them open Making
himself take this quiet moment to cherish what he has

Then his eyes fall shut Ken drifts asleep
