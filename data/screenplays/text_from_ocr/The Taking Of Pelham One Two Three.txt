Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual
face is visible because of his thick white hair large
bushy white mustache dark glasses and slouch hat The
rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat He
wears gloves and is carrying a large brown-paper-covered
package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing

it The box has been addressed in black felt marker --
Everest Printing Corp 826 Lafayette St -- and appears
quite heavy But Green has the gait of a man younger than
he appears As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs
CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign

A level above the locals two above the express trains
Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens
Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille receives
his token moves on drops it into the slot pushes

through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending
stairways CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice

Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line witha
placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing
the number 10 black on a white ground indicating the
point where the front of a ten-car train stops Now the
sound of a distant rumbling growing louder makes Green
turn cross to the platforms edge lean out over the
track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the
far end of the platform

sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train
roars and clatters into the station CAMERA PANS with
the head car as it stops its breaks sighing and a pair
of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND rattles open CAMERA now

51ST ST STATION - BUDS POV

SHOOTING THROUGH the conductors window as the train
enters the station We flash by the rear-enders (those
I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we
stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man
(GREY) whose frame and features while entirely different
from Greens are covered by the same identical externals
-- thick white hair bushy white mustache dark glasses
slouch hat gloves and raincoat He looks at the conduc-
tor (CAMERA) for an instant then darts away

PLATFORM - GREY

RIDERS entering and exiting the train as Grey heads down-
track He carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark
brown

INT FOURTH CAR

Grey just makes it to the car as the doors close holding
them back until hes squeezed through The train starts
with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes
up a position leaning his back against the storm door and
placing his valise on the floor between his feet He
surveys the car with cold heavy-lidded eyes

INT FIRST CAR
Green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the

feet long cost 250000 and weighs

to get aboard His face is adorned with a large white
bushy mustache dark glasses a lot of white hair a slouch
hat and covering the rest of him a raincoat He carries
an outsized florists box big enough for several dozen-
vibrat-â€”

long-stemmed roses under his arm and wears gloves

MATSON

not even seem aware of their cohtact Matson goes off
into the crowd on the platform and Brown heads for the
front of the car

valise turns andlooks through the door across the
platform between the cars into the fifth car and catches

Grey makes no sign of recognition at all He turns and
starts forward through the car heading for the third car
At the far end a MAN is standing in front of the door
leaning down to talk to a seated GIRL Grey stops and
waits a moment Finally

GREY
