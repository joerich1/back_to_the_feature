afternoon

man were never mistaken for another
if with seven million pair of feet
wandering through the canyons and
corridors of the city one pair
of feet never by chance strayed
into the wrong footsteps

(a pause
Strange indeed

VOICE at the rear of the car even before the man is revealed to us by the off-going
passengers He is ROGER THORNHILL tall

criginal to be wearing the gray-flannel
‘uniform of his kind) He has been dictating
to his secretary MAGGIE an aging unbeautiful
woman who has accompanied him down in the ele-
vator with pad and pencil in hand She will
have to scurry to keep up with his impatient

the lobby to the entrance

A man is playing croquet all by himself in the
fading light His name is LEONARD Later we
will see him at closer range and perhaps be
slightly repelled He is about thirty but
iooks much younger for he has a soft baby-
face large eyes and hair that falls down over
his forehead His attitudes are unmistakably
effeminate Hurrying towards him is LICHT
the other abductor Ina brief pantomime Licht
apparently gives Leonard tidings and they
quickly go off together towards the house

INT LIBRARY 31

Seeing the back lawn now deserted Thornhill tries
to open the window to escape It is locked He
unfastens the catch raises the window is about

to climb out when he draws back and turns at the
SOUND of the DOOR OPENING behind him In walks a
distinguished looking MAN of about forty profes-
sorial in manner but definitely sexually attractive
(to women) and only slightly sinister

MAN (affably)

more ease than the limousine Also Thornhill is

too far gone to know that he shouldnt drive that
fast Consequently he gets to the foot of the

hill and down to a main thoroughfare still in the
lead Naturally we film this ride and that which
follows from many different angles including
Thornhillts delirious double-vision point of view

He will be killed if he 18 caught and he will be
killed if he keeps driving this way There is very
little choice really and on the highway now he is
doing eighty weaving wildly through traffic swerving
suicidally over double lanes and giving heart failure
to oncoming truck drivers But he is leaving the
limougine behind

A POLICE CAR - TWO OFFICERS IN FRONT SEAT k3
The car is travelling along at a normal speed

Suddenly Thornhillta car comes dashing by The
officers react immediately start in pursuit

Valerian and Licht see the police car which is
almost directly in front of them take off after
Thornhill Valerian signals to Licht to slow
down Licht does so and starts to make a
U-turn

THE MERCEDES BENZ AS

Thornhill tries desperately to keep his eyes
in focus his foot on the floorboard and his
hands on the wheel HORNS BLARE warningly as
he comes perilously close to several headon
crashes In his rear-view mirror he sees
the headlights of the police car following and
does not realize that it is no longer the
limousine The headlights are coming closer
Suddenly almost too late he sees ahead of
him an elderly gentleman on a bicycle emerge
from a side road He slams on the brakes and
the car comes to a screaming wobbling stop
The bicyclist oblivious continues across

SIDE ANGLE 46

As Thornhills car comes to a final jerking
halt the police car with screaming prakes
hits Thornhills rear There is a CRUNCHING
SOUND as the bonnet of the police car cmmples
ike tin There is a MOMENTARY SILENCE and
then the sudden SCREAM of more BRAKES and a
third car smashes into the back of the police
car giving it a crumpled rear as well
Thornhill drunkenly leans out and looks pehind
to see what all the fuss is about The two
police after forcing a door open emerge
glowering At the same time the third driver
is seen getting out of his car somewhat be-
wildered and starting forward

The men look at her blankly as the other
passengers turn their heads in surprise Valerian
atarts to smile as he turns to Licht who takes
the cue and also begins to smile Valerian turns
toward the other occupants of the car and starts
to chuckle Relieved they start to chuckle too
For a split second Mrs Thornhill is astonished
at the effect of her remark Then she too

puillt to a crescendo and the whole car is
laughing even the operator In the center of
all this stands a glowering Thornhill The

of four men and one woman seated around a confer-
ence table As the CAMERA leaves the INSERT of
the newspaper and STARTS ITS RISE we also catch
and glimpse of official documents on which we SEE
the words TOF SECRET

MANS VOICE (reading)
The photograph has been tentatively
4ddentified as that of Roger Thornhill
a Manhattan advertising executive
indicating that the name George KSplan
which he gave to an attendant in the
General Assembly Building was false
A possible motive for the slaying
was suggested by the discovery that
earlier today Thornhiil appeared
in a Glen Cove Long Island police
court on a charge of drunk driving
with a stolen car and in his defense
charged that the murder victin
Mr Townsend had attempted to kill
hin the night before

‘The man puts the newspaper down on the table looks
up at the other people Their ages vary fron
thirty-five to fifty there is nothing about an
Intelligence agents appearance that distinguishes
him from say a college professor or a stock

terrain is flat and treeless even more desolate
from this vantage point than it seemed from the
air Here and there patches of low-growing farm
erops add some contour to the land A hot sun
beats down UTTER SILENCE hangs heavily in the
air Thornhill glances at his wristwatch It
8 325

In the distance the FAINT HUM of a MOTOR VEHICLE
is HEARD Thornhill looks off to the west The
HUM GROWS LODDER as the car draws nearer Thorn-
hill steps closer to the edge of the highway A
black sedan looms up travelling at high speed
For a moment we are not sure it is not hurtling
right at Thornhill And then it ZOOMS past hin
recedes into the distance becoming a FAINT HUM
a tiny speck and then SILENCE again

Fhornhill takes out a handkerchief mops his face
He is beginning to aweat now It-could be from
nervousness as well as the heat Another FAINT
HUM coming from the east GROWING LOUDER AS he
glances off and sees another distant speck be-
coming a speeding car this one a closed conver-
tible Again anticipation on Thornhills face
Again the vague uneasiness of indefinable danger
approaching at high speed And again ZOOM - 4
cloud of dust a car receding into the distance -
a FAINT EUM - and SILENCE

His lips tighten He glances at his watch again
He steps out into the middle of the highway looks
first in one direction then the other Nothing

in sight He loosens his tie opena his shirt
collar looks up at the sun Behind him in the
dietance another vehicle 1s REARD approaching

He turns looks off to the west This one is a
huge transcontinental moving van ROARING TOWARD
HIM at high speed With quick apprehension he
moves off the highway to the dusty side of the road
as the van thunders past and disappears Its FADING
SOUND is replaced with a NEW SOUND the CHUGGING of
an OLD FLIVVER

Thornhill looks off in the direction of the approach-
ing SOUND sees a flivver nearing the highway from
the intersecting dirt road When the car reaches
the highway it comes to a stop A middle-aged
woman ig behind the wheel Her passenger is a
nondescript man of about fifty He could certainly
be a farmer He geta out of the car It makes a

across the highway from him The mac glances at 2)
Thornhill without visible interest ‘en looks off

up the highway towards the east as trough waiting

for something to come along

Thornhill stares at the man wonderivg if this is
George Kaplan

The man looks idly across the highwar at Thornhill
his face expressicniess

Thornhill wipes his face with his hartxerchief
never taking his eyes off the man acress the highway
The FAINT SOUND of an APPROACHING FiN has gradually
come up over the scene As the SOUN GROWS LOUDER
Thornhill locks up to his left and s¢7s 4 low-flying
biplane approaching from the northwest He watches
it with mounting interest as it heads straight for
the spot where he and the stranger fa2 each other
‘across the highway Suddenly it is «ron them only
a hundred feet above the ground and then like a
giant bird as Thornhill turns with -2 planes —
passage it flies over them and continues on
Thornhill stares after the plane his dack to the
highway When the plane has gone several hundred
yards beyond the highway it loses atitude levels
off only a few feet above the ground and begine to
fly back and forth in straight lines sarailel to

the highway letting loose a trail of powdered dust
from beneath its fuselage as it gocsr Any farmer
would recognize the operation as simy-° crop-
dusting 4

Thornhill looks acress the highway 28 that the
stranger is watching the plane with ‘dle interest

Thornhill looks off to the east sees a Greyhound
bus approaching The man peers off at the plane
again and frowns

there aint no crops

Thornhill looks across at the droning plane with
growing suspicion as the stranger steps out onto
the highway and flags the bus to a stop Thornhill
turns toward the stranger as though to say some-
thing to him But it 4g too late The man has
boarded the bus its doors are closing and it is
pulling away Thornhill is aione again

Almost immediately he HEARS the PLANE ENGINE BEING
GUNNED TO A HIGHER SPEED He glances off sharply
sees the plane veering off its parallel course and
heading towards him He stands there wide-eyed
rooted to the spot The plane roars on a few
feet off the ground There are two men in the twin
cockpits gogegled unrecognizable menacing He
yells out to them but his voice is lost in the
NOISE of the PLANE In a moment it will be upon
him and decapitate him Desperately he drops to
the ground and presses himself flat as the plane
zooms over him with a great noise almost

combing his hair with a landing wheel

a telephone pole and dashes for it as the plane comes at him again He ducks behind the pole The
plane heads straight for him veers to the righ
at the last moment We HEAR two sharp CRACKS cf
GUNFIRE mixed with the SOUND of THE ENGINE as

two bullets slam into the pole just above
Thornhillts head

Thornhill reacts to this new peril sees the plice
banking for another run at him A car is speeci-5
along the highway from the west Thornhill dasn3
out onto the road tries to flag the car down tu
the driver ignores him and races by leaving hin
exposed and vulnerable as the plane roars in on
him He dives into a ditch and rolis away as
another series of SHOTS are HEARD and bullets rec

He gets to his feet looks about sees 3 cornfis2
about fifty yards from the highway glances up £7
the plane making its turn and decides to make £
dash for the cover of the tall-growing corn

SHOCTING DOWN FROM A HELICOPTER about one hundrs

towards the cornfield and the plane in pursuit

The Diesel tanker THUNDERS down the highway towards

The plane speeds relentlessly towards Thornhill
from the field bordering the highway7 —

Thornhill stands alone and helpless in the middle
of the highway waving his arms The plane draws
closer The tanker is almost upon him It isnt
going to stop He can HEAR THE KLAXON BLASTING
him out of the way There is nothing he can do
The plane has caught up with him The tanker

to the pavement directly in its path There is a
SCREAM OF BRAKES and SKIDDING TIRES THE ROAR OF

Diesel truck grinds to a stop inches from Thorn-
hills body just as the plane hopelessly
committed and caught unprepared by the sudden
stop slams into the travelling gasoline tanker
and plane and gasoline explode into a great sheet
of flame -

In the next few moments all is confusion Thorn-

INT EVES HOTEL ROOM 120

Eve turns stares at Thormhill as she closes
the door behind him If his back were not to
her he would sea the mixed emotions on her
face - not just surprise but overwhelming
relief too But relief is not something she
ean afford to reveal too strongly because
that would indicate that there was something
to be relieved about She is almost completely
controlled by the time Thornhill turns to

her after a very brief moment in which his
darting glance has taken in the room and the
open door to the bathroom and noticed nothing
worthy of apprehension

THORNEILL
Surprised

EVE
Yes

She stares at him still shaken

THORNHILL
No getting rid of me is
there

Suddenly Eve goes up to him puts her arms around
him holds him close and presses her face to
his breast Is it tenderness and relief or
merely the need to hide from the double-edged
meaning of his last remark Thornhill puts his
hands on her but without affection He knows
he is on to something now and he intends to
play it cool Occasionally his deep down anger
will make him say incautious things he oughtnt
to say if he intends to disarm the girl - and
just as occasionally he will be even warmer
than he intended to-be He cant help liking
this female a little bit even while he would
like to slug her its because he remembers
last night Its because also she happens

to be of the opposite sex

Has anyone ever told you that you overplay your
various roles rather severely
Mr Kaplan First youre
the outraged Madison Avenue
man whe claims he has been
mistaken for someone else
Then you play a fugitive
from justice supposedly
trying to clear his name
ef a crine he knows he
didnt commit And now
you play the peevish
lover stung by jealousy
and betrayal

could stand a little less

to his right towards the side of the house where
the incline is less steep Just as he reaches the
nouse he stops on the alert as he HEARS THE
SOUND OF AN APPROACHING CAR He looks off sees

POINT OF VIEW 171

The headlights of the approaching car sweep along
the driveway and then the car itself is seen
coming around the side of the house and pulling to

a stop in the parking area It is a small sedan
The driver gets out It is Valerian He is carry-
ing a newspaper At this moment a side door of the
house opens and a woman walks out to meet Valerian
It is the housekeeper last seen at the Townsend
estate in Glen Cove Together they go toward the
house moving directly towards Thornhill

THORNHILL 172

Re quickly ducks beneath the cantilevered portion
of the house and hides He FEARS A DOOR OPENING
AND CLOSING then FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES INSIDE

THE HOUSE ABOVE HIM the sound coming through

the floor Thornhill glances about then decides
to climb up one of the cantilevers This will
enable him to get a view of what might be going on
inside the house All the time that he has been
underneath the house he has been HEARING A MUMBLE
OF VOICES FROM ABOVE He moves forward

173-174
ENOTHER ANGLE - EXT HODSE 175

Thornhill appears from beneath the house groping
his way up the diagonal beam of the cantilever and
then climbing up onto the horizontal beam He is
now outside one of the large windows of tha living-

cat-like stealth he moves along the cantilever
towards the window takes up 4 position in the

Thornhill watches as Eve goes up to the balcony
Leonard stares at her all the way and Vandam
peers at him sensing hostility in his attitude
When Eve disappears into one of the bedrooms
Vandamm addresses Leonard with a trace of
facetiousness

VANDAMM
Well Leonard how does one say
farewell to ones own right arm

LEONARD
In your case sir Im afraid
youre going to wish you had

During the above interchange Thornhill will
giance sharply up to his right when he sees

the lights go on in the balcony bedroom window
and then Eve herself appear for a moment at the
window The voices in the living-room dwindle
toan wnintellicible drone as Thornnill backs

away fron the open living-room window toward

the end of the cantilever beam He is now in a
better position to attract Eves attention He
glances about for a pebble to throw but he is too
far above ground to reach one He takes a coin

Just as Thornhill starts to call to her he glances
Sharply toward the living-roon

Leonard is walking briskly over to the open living-

Thornhill ducks back into the shadows against the
housas

Leonard peers out ‘of the living-room window to see
the cause of the noise he had heard Eve continues
to look out of the bedroom window Thornhill cannot
move out to signal her Seeing nothing Eve closes
the window again and walks away

Thornhill glances toward the iiving-room window and
his eyes widen

Leonard has moved away from the window and with his
back to Vandamm is taking gum from his pocket and
placing it on a table near the window as Vandamm
talks in bg his words unintelligible

Thornhill edges up to the window as Leonard turns
around the gun concealed on the table behind hin
The ‘dialogue becomes intelligible again

VANDAMM (defensively)
She shot him in a moment of fear and

And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundles

picks up the gun holds it behind
his back and advances further into
