MUSIC (song continues)

INT DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 2

CREDITS ROLL as a gorgeous girl CHLOE dressed like a
1970s flight attendant frantically rummages through a
swanky dressing room

CHLOE
Shitballs where is it

Chloe stops reaches into her jacket pocket and pulls out a
red scarf Relieved she DASHES out of the room

INT STAGE - SAME TIME 3

As the BU Treblemakers sing we WIDEN TO REVEAL A sold out
audience at Lincoln Center The atmosphere is reminiscent of
an American Idol finale PROUD PARENTS COEDS and A
CAPPELLA FANATICS hold up signs “I HEART BELLAS” “I’LL
TREBLE 4 YA” and “A CAPPELLA IS MY CO-PILOT”

INT BACKSTAGE STAIRWELL - SAME TIME 4

A winded Chloe runs up a set of stairs clumsily wrapping the
scarf around her neck
INT ANNOUNCER BOOTH - SAME TIME
GAIL and JOHN a cappella alums color-commentate

JOHN
This is exactly the type of
performance you would expect to see
at “The International Championship
of Collegiate A Cappella” Isn’t
that right Gail

GAIL
John youre so right that
everything else seems wrong This
is what the ICCA’s are all about

ANGLE ON The Barden Treblemakers The guys are crushing

it

JOHN (0C)
The Barden University Treblemakers
never disappoint It is their
showbotage that is re-defining
modern a cappella And the ladies
well they just can’t get enough

GAIL
Yes Nothing makes a girl feel
more like a woman than a man who
sings like a boy
A TREBLE steps forward to solo the next lyric

TREBLE SOLOIST
I WANNA TAKE YOU AWAY

On the word “Away” he goes flat

GAILJOHN
Whoa Boom

JOHN

That was flatter than my ex-wife’s
chest The Asian one get alts

INT BACKSTAGE OF LINCOLN CENTER - SAME TIME

Chloe runs past a variety of A CAPPELLA GROUPS readying
themselves to compete stopping at the all-female Bellas A
group of model-esque ladies dressed exactly like her Chloe
lifts up her scarf and comes face to face with Alice

( )

CHLOE
I found it

On stage the BU Treblemakers continue singing

ALICE
Chloe look at you You’re a mess

ALICE the aggressive leader undoes Chloes scarf and then
methodically re-ties it

ALICE (CONTD)
You’re unreliable You’re
unfocused And your breath smells
like egg Like all the time

Alice pushes the knot up to Chloes throat Chloe winces
Then Alice turns to address both Chloe and AUBREY an
exceptionally focused girl standing next to her

ALICE (CONTD)
I can’t believe the Bellas are in
the hands of you two slut bags
after we graduate

Alice gets right up in Aubrey’s face

ALICE (CONTD)
Eff up your solo and I’11 tell
everyone you were born without a
butthole and it all just comes out
the front

AUBREY
I won’t disappoint you My dad
always says if you’re not here to
win get the hell out of Kuwait

INT STAGEORCHESTRA PITBACKSTAGESTAGE - CONTINUOUS 7
The Trebles end their performance to wild applause

JOHN
With a couple of shaky notes in
there it’s anybody’s game now
Next up BU’s other group The
Barden Bellas

BACKSTAGE The Trebles brush past the Bellas BUMPER the
Trebles outspoken ringleader stops to address them

BUMPER

(genuine” )
Good luck out there Seriously I
mean that You guys are
awesomely horrible I hate you
Kill yourselves

(all girly)
Girl Power Sisters before
Misters Go get ‘em gang

Bumper crosses away An infuriated Alice turns to the ladies

ALICE
Now or never bitches HANDS IN

Alice puts her fist out Nine others meet hers

ALICE (CONTD)

One two --
ALL
(Mariah Carey-high note)
-- AHHH
EMCEE (0C)
Please give it up for the Barden
Bellas

The ladies run out on stage and take their position Alice
steps up to the microphone

JOHN (0C)
The Bellas Making history as the
first all-female group to ever
advance to the ICCA finals

GAIL (0C)
John why do you think it’s taken
so long for an all-lady group to
break through the glass ceiling of
a cappella

JOHN
Well women typically can’t hit the
low notes that round out a musical
arrangement and that limits them
They’re about as good at a cappella
as they are at being doctors

ON STAGE Alice blows the pitch pipe It’s red with a large
cursive “B” on it

( ) 7

ALICE
One two three four

They begin the arrangement and choreography to Ace of Base’s
‘The Sign’ The performance is over-polished and safe

ALICE (CONT’D)
RAMBOON NA BOO YEAHI I GOTTA NEW
LIFE YOU WOULD HARDLY RECOGNIZE
ME I’M SO GLAD (song continues)

GAIL (0C)
So just how did the Bellas make it
to the finals

JOHN (0C)
Hard work Gail When it comes to
the technical aspects of the
performance they never falter
Plus they are very good looking

ALICE
IT’S ENOUGH ENOUGH

BELLAS
OO-OOO000H

ALICE
IT’S ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT I

“The Sign” rendition has lulled the audience into a coma-like
state One JUDGE even yawns

GAIL (0S)
Feels like we all just took a left
turn into Snoozeville John

JOHN
And parked in a lot where they do
not validate

GAIL
At this level of competition
they’re a little too traditional
don’t you think No surprise
factor

JOHN (0C)
Yes It’s like after nine years of
marriage knowing exactly what my
Orthodox Jewish wife will be
wearing to bed

( ) 7

GAIL
The wig John

JOHN
And the wool skirt

John and Gail wince Aubrey steps up to solo
AUBREY (INTO MIC)
UNDER THE PALE MOON WHERE I SEE A
LOT OF STARSIT’S ENOUGH TO KNOWI
SAW THE SIGN AND IT OPE(NED)

Aubrey projectile PUKES and we FREEZE The puke hangs there
frozen in mid-air

Newspaper” another reads “Dudes With Ponytails Est 1988”

Beca headphones around her neck and Kimmy Jin are at the
booth “RIAC Running in a Circle” Two REPRESENTATIVES give
Beca the hard sell

RIAC REPRESENTATIVE 1
Basically what we do is we join
arms in a large ring and we run
clockwise and sometimes we’1ll do
variations on that

RIAC REPRESENTATIVE 2
It’s really about movement and
health circulation mimicking the
earth’s orbit around the sun

BECA
So you run around in a circle

BECA
Yeah I’m gonna look around --

Benji stuffs a red scarf into his fist and then holds up his
empty hands A little piece of the scarf protrudes from
Benji’s enormous fake thumb He fails the trick a couple of
times Bumper just stares

I was offered a job at a lab that
tests the effects of marijuana on
your appetite but I said no I
want to stack cd’s hopefully in
the vicinity of a semen smeared
desk -- That’s what we think
happened here right

BECA
(playing along)
Too bad I didn’t bring my black
light Then we’d know for sure

JESSE
So what’s your deal You one of
those girls who’s all dark and
mysterious until she takes off her
glasses and that amazingly scary
ear spike and you realize she was
beautiful the whole time

BECA
I don’t wear glasses

JESSE
Then you’re halfway there
(re stacking)
I am loving this

BECA
You’re a weirdo

JESSE
Yes I am And so are you It’s a
good thing we’re going to be best
friends andor lovers

BECA
Please don’t say “lovers”

JESSE
You know I wouldn’t pass this up
Once I’m a Treble I probably won’t
have time for you

BECA
You know I didn’t think you could
find a way to be less attractive to
me but congrats you just did

ridiculed upper-decked and cyber-
bullied by elected officials I am
also currently failing out of this
university And though I too cannot
sing a drop there is nowhere I’d
rather be than in the welcome
embrace of Barden a cappella But
if you think this is like some high
school club where you sing and
dance your way through big social
issues you’ve come to the wrong
place It’s nothing like that
That’s high school This shit is

to be stopped She grabs a chair and drags it across the
floor She finally leaves crying loudly through the hall

INT BECA’S DORM ROOM - LATER 52

Beca’s at her desk with her headphones on working on her
computer Jesse’s right there watching her work

BECA

(yelling)
I find songs with the same chord
progressions and create a track
that blends them all together This
is the new baseline this matches
up the downbeats and I’m talking
really loud aren’t I

Jesse nods

BECA (CONTD)
(kind of shy)
And that’s me singing

Jesse takes the headphones and listens to Beca’s “mash-up”
His eyes light up clearly impressed

JESSE
(extra loud)
This is really good
(re volume)
Now I’m yelling right

Beca smiles Jesse takes off the headphones

JESSE (CONTD)
How’d you know they’d go together

Beca shrugs Jesse holds up a DVD
JESSE (CONT’D)
I brought this over ‘cause I want
to watch you watch the end of this

JESSE
Ssssshhhhh
(then)
“The Breakfast Club” 1985
Greatest ending to any movie ever

Jesse cues it to the end where Simple Minds’s “Don’t You
(Forget About Me)” plays

JESSE (CONTD)
This song launched Simple Minds in
the US It could have been a Billy
Idol song but he turned it down
Dummy Perfectly sums up the movie -
equally beautiful and sad

BECA
Wow Amazing What does Judd
Nelson like to eat for breakfast

JESSE
Like all misunderstood rebels he
feeds on hypocrisy And black
coffee Helps with his morning
dumps

BECA
You’re an idiot

JESSE
It’s true I’m full of fun facts

BECA
You should let other people tell
you they’re fun

ON THE SCREEN We see each character getting picked up and
as the song crescendos John Bender raises a defiant joyful
fist Jesse so into it can’t help but do a smaller version
of it too Beca looks at him more amused by what he’s
doing than the movie He turns to her

JESSE
You’re missing the ending

Inches away from each other’s faces Jesse makes a move
Freaked out Beca shuts the laptop

The lights come on ANGLE ON Kimmy Jin and several Koreans
at the door holding take-out

KIMMY JIN

The white girl is back

Jesse hangs his head

JESSE
And I’m out

As he leaves

past all of the Koreans In leaving abruptly he forgot his

Finals

BECA
Or try a new approach

AUBREY
Enough with that Beca

BECA
Wait listen the reason why we
almost lost to sock puppets is
because they took a risk Being
good isn’t enough to win

CYNTHIA ROSE
Beca’s right The Trebles never
sing the same song twice

BECA

The audience loves the Trebles
They tolerate us Aubrey we could
seriously change the face of a
cappella if you would just let me
teach you my music

(hearing herself)
That sounded so queerballs

Subtle nods can be seen amongst the girls as Beca moves to
her workstation and turns on her computer keyboard etc

BECA (CONTD)
Look I’ve been working on this
arrangement

She starts playing the keyboard and multi-tasking with her
equipment The music plays and the song gets more and more
layered
