TITLES UP San Francisco 1978 The words dissolve and we
hold on blackness Hear soft eerie wind chimes CUT TO

EXT HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

PUSH across a leaf-strewn lawn to find a GIRL eight with
long braids staring at an abandoned Victorian house that has
fallen into grave disrepair Shutters missing paint
peelingan ingenue turned dowager by the march of time

Suddenly a rock whizzes by the girl’s head and SHATTERS an
upper story window She turns and we finally SEE her face
This is ADELAIDE and she has Down Syndrome

TWO BOYS TEN bash a gate open with a baseball bat and strut
into the yard This is Troy and Bryanthe Rutger twins

TROY
Hey retard

They head into the empty derelict house on a mission
Adelaide suddenly speaks

ADELAIDE
Excuse me

They stop turn

ADELAIDE (CONTD)
You’re going to die in there

They stare at her a beat the moment is shocking Then Troy
runs to her viciously pushes her to the ground He regards
her spits on her then heads back into the house

INT HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

CLASSICAL music plays FLASHLIGHT BEAMS illuminate stunning
Victorian fixtures as they are shattered by the bat Leaded
stained glass intricate moldingsthe destruction is
horrifying and complete punctuated by the loud gunshot
firecracker sound of SNAP and POPS the boys throw everywhere

INT KITCHEN -- AFTERNOON

Troy bashes stunningly beautiful leaded cabinets shattering
the glass Suddenly with alarm from another room --

BRYAN
Troy
INT LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

We are on Troy’s face as he slowly makes his way across the
empty room All we HEAR is the sound of fliesa faint
buzzing then a cacophony He finally stops near where his
brother is standing and kneels down

TROY
Awesome

He is looking at a dead gutted POSSUMsomeone something
has feasted here The possum’s face is frozen and twisted in
fear ANGLE the boys crouching reflection in the gray flat
dead eye of the animal Just then a NOISE Faint childish
LAUGHTER Adelaide The boys investigate

They walk down the hall when suddenly a BASEMENT DOOR at the
other end slowly creaks opens The boys freeze then --

TROY (CONT’D)
(afraid)
Go

BRYAN
You go shithead

A dare Troy moves forward His brother follows

INT BASEMENT -- CONTINUOUS

A murky soup the flashlights cut a swath

The beams illuminate the odd stray cobweb nothing much down
here The boys split up to investigate Troy throwing the odd
snap and pop Until --

TROY
Check it out

Bryan approaches and stares with wonder The flashlights
illuminate a wall of dusty SPECIMEN JARS filled with yellow
viscous fluid Within the fluid monstrosities Severed
deformed hands feet a twisted jawa horrifying tableau in
the style of Joel Peter Witkin

Next to the jars a neat line of surgical equipment Clamps
disembowelers spreadersall caked in rusty blood

A moment of awe from the boys WE SEE (but they don’t)
something move behind them A flash of white

Troy picks up one of the jars studies it
BRYAN
Dont

But Troy smashes it against a wall it shatters

TROY
It stinks down here It stinks like
shit
(beat)
Last summer when we had a raccoon
stuck in the chimney That’s what
it smells like Let’s go find it

BRYAN
No it smells bad I’m going

Bryan starts off Troy starts investigating throwing the
snap and pops Bryan is half way up the stairs when the snap
and pops ABRUPTLY STOP

BRYAN (CONTD)
Troy

There is no sound Then a faint childish laugh
BRYAN (CONTD)
(freaked)

Who’s down here

Silence He moves down the creaking steps Until his
flashlight beam finds

Troyeyes wide with fearhis throat ripped out

Terrified Bryan feels something behind him He hears a
noise breathing He slowly turns his beam ILLUMINATES

A blonde two year old BOY wearing a Lindberg-era white
christening gown with seed pearls long yellowed His mouth
and face is smeared with blood his skin is wrinkled like an
ancient man The INFANTATA smiles gurgles

Then ATTACKS

The lightlight falls to the ground

FADE TO BLACK

A SINGLE WORD POPS UP TODAY

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE -- DAY

THE SOUND OF RUNNING WATER Come up on a TRAY of
INSTRUMENTS
A stainless steel SPECULUM a large SYRINGE with NEEDLE
COTTON SWABS COTTON BALLS RUBBER GLOVES The water stops
and the hands of DR DAY come into view He towels them off
pulls on the gloves

DR DAY
Are your periods regular again

He messes with the instruments as a WOMAN speaks It’s VIVIEN
HARMON

VIVIEN
Pretty much Every other month

Dr Day turns REVEAL Vivien gowned on her back her legs
in STIRRUPS She’s pretty forty but she looks thirty five

VIVIEN (CONTD)
I’m not complaining After all of
that blood

Day inserts his gloved fingers into Vivien beginning his
exam She takes in a sharp breath

VIVIEN (CONTD)
Ben hates blood

DR DAY
How are you two doing Sexual
relations

Day is clinical He’s not looking to get off here

VIVIEN
Sometimes

He inserts the speculum She exhales It hurts a little

DR DAY
You having trouble with arousal

VIVIEN
A little Thought maybe it was pre-
menopause

He pulls out the speculum takes off his gloves

DR DAY
Could be Any issues achieving
climax

VIVIEN

I don’t know it depends When I’m
alone it’s fine
He nods

DR DAY
Well things look great from a
physical standpoint Are you
anxious about having sex About
something happening

VIVIEN
You mean like getting pregnant

DR DAY
It would be a normal response

VIVIEN
Well I would like to go back on my
birth control pills

He takes out her FILE Writes --

DR DAY
I want to wait a beat on those
They can cause irregularities in
your hormone levels and I think
you’re already having some issues
in that department Your cycle the
sexual issues

VIVIEN
I don’t have sexual issues
(then)
Maybe I’m just depressed

Day takes a beat then keeps writing -- that’s not his field
of expertise

DR DAY
I’ve recently had some success with
women your age using bioidentical
hormone treatments Estrogen
progestin

VIVIEN
Wait so I am going through
menopause

DR DAY
I don’t think so This is more of
a pre-emptive strike Your body is
like a house you can fix the tiles
in the bathroom and the kitchen but
if the foundation is decaying
you’re wasting your time
VIVIEN
Are there any side effects

DR DAY
The bHRT’s are great for your skin
your organs Most of the women I
give these to tell me they make
them feel ten years younger

VIVIEN
I don’t let my family use plastic
bottles or hold their cell phones
to their ears now you want me to
put something in my body and not
tell me side effects Don’t they
make those things with horse pee

DR DAY
Feel and look ten years younger

VIVIEN
The arousal issue is mine not
Ben’s I’m just reconnecting with
my body after what happened I
don’t want to give it away again

DR DAY
You’re worried about losing
control I’m offering you something
to help you get it back

VIVIEN
I’m not a house

DR DAY
Vivien what are you so afraid of

Off Vivien unsure of the answer --

INT BACK BAY BROWNSTONE -- DAY

Vivien comes home with GROCERIES Goes into the KITCHEN
Starts unloading Along with the food is a LITTLE PHARMACY
bag She pulls out the hormone pills and creams looks at
them thinks then HEARS A NOISE from upstairs A piece of
furniture being moved Her eyes go wide Then the sound
again longer louder She’s TERRIFIED dials the phone 911

OPERATOR

emergency
VIVIEN
(whispering)
There’s someone in my house

OPERATOR

your family

VIVIEN
No My daughter is at school and my
husband is at work I think someone
is robbing us Someone robbed the
brownstone next door two weeks ago

OPERATOR
Were sending a patrol car

She hears a THUNK -- like a body hitting the floor She
hangs up Thinks Grabs a KNIFE and starts upstairs

INT SECOND FLOOR -- CONTINUOUS

ANGLE on the gleaming knife at her side More sounds Vivien
slowly makes her way to the door takes a deep breath and
CREAKS it open On her face the blood rushing out of it

GIRLS VOICE (0S)
Oh shit

Vivien backs out into the hallway almost goes over the
railing She’s going to throw up Before she can her
husband BEN comes out naked He’s 42 fit handsome as she
is pretty

BEN
Vivien

He goes to hug her She instinctively SLASHES at him with the
knife It SCRAPES his arm Both of them look at the small
yet real wound shocked She drops the knife He takes her
in his arms and keeps repeating with hysteria

BEN (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry

She lets him hold her for a beat then breaks away in tears
and runs down the stairs Off a naked bleeding Ben we SMASH
TO BLACK

INT CAR -- DAY

DRIVING OVER THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE SIX MONTHS LATER Hard
SUNLIGHT through the windows Ben’s driving
Vivien in the passenger seat staring out the window Their
fifteen year old GOTH daughter VIOLET in the back with six
month old DOG HALLIE

BEN
Isn’t it beautiful

VIVIEN
The light is different from Boston
Feels like I can see more I
thought it was supposed to be all
foggy

VIOLET
I need to go to the bathroom

BEN
It’s just a little while longer

VIOLET
I need to go

BEN
Where would you like me to pull
over sweetie -- the Bay or the
Pacific

VIOLET

(re the dog)
Bet if baby substitute had to shit
you’d find somewhere

VIVIEN
I don’t like that word Violet

A beat then Violet looks out the window Thoughtfully --

VIOLET
Thirteen hundred people have jumped
off of this thing -- at least

that’s what they think They don’t
see them all and they stopped
counting right before a thousand
I looked it up Twenty six of them
survived You know what all of
them said was their first thought
after they stepped off

(then mischievous)
Oh shit

Her mother’s discomfort makes Violet grin
VIOLET (CONTD)
Kind of how I feel about this move
(then)
I’m not going to like the school
San Francisco is filled with
hippies and freaks and drug
addicts

BEN
I’m glad we named you Violet
instead of our second choice

VIOLET
Which was

BEN
Sunshine

They all kind of crack up A fleeting moment of family
togetherness Ben shares a smile with his wife then reaches
out his hand to hold hers but she PULLS it AWAY

EXT OLD VICTORIAN HOUSE -- DAY

They pull into the driveway Everyone takes a good look --
it’s looking better than it did the last time we saw it New
paint shutters gutters There’s a FOR SALE sign on the
lawn All three of them take it in as they come to a stop

BEN
This is it

Vivien is unsure Violet is intrigued MARCY the RELATOR
greets them from the front porch with a WAVE

INT HOUSE -- DAY

Marcy shows them around The FOYER is epic beautiful
soaring ceilings and a grand STAIRCASE House porn

MARCY
It’s the finest Queen Anne on the
market Venetian chandeliers
original moldings The stained
glass is some of the only of it’s
kind that survived the great quake
As you can see the previous owners
really loved the place like a
child They restored everything

VIVIEN
Gay

MARCY
Sweetheart it’s San Francisco
they’re all gay

Light laughter Except from Violet who rolls her eyes Ben
sees this and fights a laugh They head into the KITCHEN

INT KITCHEN

It’s beautiful Looks original except with all of the modern
bells and whistles

MARCY
Do you cook

BEN
Viv is a great cook I got her
cooking lessons a few years ago for
her birthday and she ended up
teaching the teacher a few things

MARCY
Cooking lessons Romantic You’re
a psychiatrist

BEN
Psychologist You said something on
the phone about there being a study
upstairs that I could use as a home
office I’m planning on seeing
patients here so I can spend more
time with the family

MARCY
How refreshing

Vivien shakes her head
INT HALLWAY -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS

Hallie sniffs around PEES in a corner then SENSES
SOMETHING Explores then -- STARTS BARKING LIKE CRAZY

INT KITCHEN
Violet is staring out the window at the BACKYARD
VIVIEN
Violet will you go see what’s

going on with Hallie

Violet storms out Teenager

INT HALLWAY
Violet finds Hallie barking madly at the BASEMENT DOOR

VIOLET
Shut up

She won’t Violet looks at the door It’s BOLTED SHUT Old
school bolted Two heavy bolts and two HUGE PADLOCKS
Someone doesn’t want to let anyone in -- or maybe out

Violet wiggles the doorknob trying to pry it open

INT BASEMENT -- DAY

From the BOTTOM of the steps POV of something watching the
door move the knob jiggle We hear it’s raspy breathing

INT HALLWAY

Violet tries the door a few more times then yanks on the
locks No luck She stares at the door oddly drawn to it

INT LIBRARY -- DAY

Marcy shows Vivien and Ben the BEAUTIFUL GOTHIC LIBRARY

MARCY
This is my favorite room in the
house

BEN

(to Vivien trying)
When I saw the pictures of this
room online I thought maybe you
could use it as your music room

MARCY
You’re a musician

VIVIEN
I was

BEN
She’s a cellist She played in the
Boston philharmonic

She heads over to the WALL Something isn’t right

MARCY
Why did you quit

There’s an answer but we’re not going to get it

VIVIEN
This wallpaper is coming off

She goes to the wall grabs a tiny PEELING PIECE of seagrass
wallpaper and gently pulls it off It opens a small window to
the ORIGINAL WALL no bigger than a couple of postage stamps

VIVIEN (CONTD)
I think there’s a mural under here

MARCY
The last owners must have covered
it up They were modernists
(then with difficulty)
Speaking of the last owners full
disclosure requires me to tell you
about what happened to them

VIVIEN
Oh God one of them didn’t die in
here did they

MARCY
Yes actually Both of them
(off their shock)
Murder suicide I sold them the
house too Just the sweetest
couple You never know I guess

BEN
So that’s why it’s half the price
of every other house in the
neighborhood

MARCY
I have a very nice painted lady not
too far from here but you’re going
to get a third of the house for
twice the price if you go that way
Vivien and Ben aren’t sure Violet comes in carrying Hallie

VIOLET
Where did it happen

MARCY
The basement

Another beat Violet grins

VIOLET
Well take it

off Ben and Vivien --

EXT HOUSE - EVENING

As MOVERS finish bringing the last boxes in Marcy pulls the
IN ESCROW sign off of the FOR SALE sign and replaces it with
one that says SOLD

INT HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Ben comes out the bathroom in his pajamas happy Vivien is
still unpacking there are boxes everywhere He comes in
behind her kisses her she gently moves away

BEN
Come to bed we’ll finish this in
the morning

VIVIEN
I’m worried about Violet She’s
right about kids being different
out here She can’t handle another
year of not fitting in

BEN

You mean you can’t

(then)
I treat kids like Violet every day
In three months she’ll have lost
all of the dark eye make up and
combat boots and be walking around
in Birkenstocks with unshaven pits
smelling like patchouli

She laughs He takes her in his arms

VIVIEN
It doesn’t freak you out at all
What happened here

BEN

My repulsion is tempered by the
fact that this house is worth four
times what we paid for it

VIVIEN
But it’s not like some old lady
died in here A murder-suicide
Gives me the creeps just thinking
about it

BEN
So don’t think about it

VIVIEN
That’s your professional advice
doctor

BEN

No place is perfect No place and
no person
(then)
All I know is that for the first
time in months I feel at home
somewhere Moving here buying this
house was the right thing to do for
our family It’s a good thing and
frankly we deserve some good after
all the shit we’ve been through
(then realizing)
Sorry

She nods not sure but desperate to trust him He kisses
her Another fleeting moment this one of marital bliss but
she can’t sustain it She pulls away leaves him to go do
more unpacking

EXT SCHOOL COURTYARD -- DAY

Violet walks through the commons SMOKING She surveys the
scene -- a few kids reliving their grandparents’ Haight
Ashbury fashion mistakes but most are unmemorable Upper
middle class high school in an upscale urban neighborhood

She passes THREE pretty girls -- seniors dressed like theyre
twenty-five -- talking up some boys -- LEAH BECCA and ABBY
Overhears their conversation --

LEAH
So I let him

BECCA
Do coke off of your nipples

LEAH
They were numb for like two days

They all crack up Violet tries to disappear into her sweater
as she passes but --

LEAH (CONTD)
Hey Student council passed a rule
against smoking in public spaces

The girls step in front of her

BECCA
Second hand smoke kills

Violet puts the cigarette out

VIOLET
I didn’t know I’m new

Violet nervously flicks her butt into a planter Leah flips

LEAH
What the hell is the matter with
you People sit here They eat
here

VIOLET
You don’t know me Why are you
doing this

BECCA
Leah’s grandma died of lung cancer
She takes this stuff pretty
seriously

Leah holds the butt out to Violet

LEAH
Eat it
(off Violet’s shock)
Eat it Or I’m going to kick the
shit out of you

ABBY
Come on Leah it’s enough

LEAH
No I want to see her eat it

She grabs Violets face

BECCA
Seriously Leah she’s like twelve

Leah starts trying to shove the cigarette into Violets
mouth but Violet resists then instinctively SPITS in Leah’s
face That stuns everyone Abby and Becca can’t help but
laugh A beat then Violet takes off running

LEAH
(calling after her)
You’re dead DEAD

INT HOUSE -- MUSIC ROOM -- DAY

Vivien drops the NEEDLE on an old record player Classical

cello plays as she sets out her INSTRUMENTS -- a large bowl
of water scraping tool small knife Slowly and carefully
she starts removing the old wallpaper

As she does the GOYA-ESQUE MURAL begins to reveal itself
She can’t quite make out the first image -- until she pulls
off one more sliver or paper to see -- A WOMAN her face bent
in pain her body twisted and tortured

Vivien stares at the image transfixed and disturbed when
suddenly a HAND touches her shoulder She jumps out of her
skin turns sees ADELAIDE the child with Down Syndrome we
saw earlier now a woman in her forties

ADELAIDE
You’re going to die in here

CONSTANCE (0S)
Adelaide

Constance Adelaide’s mother enters from the kitchen carrying
a BOX Constance is a chain smoker and she sounds like it

CONSTANCE (CONTD)
Adelaide I put that “Dora the
Explorer” on for you so you would
sit and watch it

ADELATDE
It was “Go Diego Go” I don’t like
it

CONSTANCE
Brown cartoon characters -- you

can’t tell the difference
Vivien doesn’t know what to make of this Finally --

CONSTANCE (CONTD)
Hi Hi I’m Constance your neighbor
-- the tear down next door This
is my girl Adelaide Go home Addy
Now

Adelaide storms out

CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
That girl is a monster I love her
and I’m a good Christian but Jesus
H

(MORE )

CONSTANCE (CONTD)
Christ if they’d invented some of
those tests a few years earlier

VIVIEN
How did you get in my house

CONSTANCE
You left your back door open
though I have to warn you Addy
seems to always find a way in
She’s got a bug up her ass for this
place always has You got a dog

VIVIEN
Yes Is that a problem

CONSTANCE
Better for me I run a little
kennel out of my house Doggy day
care kind of thing Don’t bother
calling the cops on me -- I’m in
with one of the city managers and
he always looks the other way

VIVIEN
Look it’s very nice to meet you
but I wasn’t really prepared for
company

CONSTANCE
I’m gone Brought this for you
housewarming Addy wanted to cook
you a pie but she tends to spit in
the cooking so I figured this was
better -- should help you get rid
of some of the bad ju-ju

She hands Vivien the box

CONSTANCE (CONTD)

Those homosexual boys were nice
enough and I say live and let live
but I can’t help but think that
that lifestyle drove them to do
what they did

(then)
I can’t remember your name

VIVIEN
I didn’t tell you I’m Vivien
Harmon

CONSTANCE
Anyway enjoy relax let me know
if you need help with your pup
Glad you’re getting rid of that
wallpaper Thought those people
were supposed to be stylish

She exits Vivien can’t help but laugh a little at their
oddity She shakes her head opens the box to see a TIGHTLY
WOUND BUNCH OF SAGE A beat then -- through the window she
sees Constance walking back to her house

CONSTANCE (CONTD)
(calling back)
It’s Sage For cleansing the
spirits in the house Too many bad
memories in there

INT HOUSE -- SAGE MONTAGE -- NIGHT

Vivien moves through the house the burning sage bundle in
her hand She’s not sure if she buys this whole cleansing the
spirits thing but she’s committing She moves into an
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY --

She hasn’t spent much time in this part of the house yet
It’s barely decorated and there are even a few EMPTY BOXES
stacked at the dead end Suddenly the flame in the sage
bundle is BLOWN OUT Odd She looks UP for the source and
discovers a DRAFT coming from a TRAP DOOR IN THE CEILING
The attic

She puts down the sage pulls over a chair Standing on it
she pulls the DRAWSTRING

INT THE ATTIC -- LOOKING DOWN ON VIVIEN

The DOOR opens and STAIRS extend into the hallway Common in
these old houses She climbs in DARKNESS SILENCE Her eyes
adjust Miraculously she finds a LIGHT CORD pulls it

The single bulb turns on and she’s standing face to face with
a BLACK RUBBER MAN

INT BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Ben is on the bed reading when he hears his wife SCREAM
INT ATTIC

Ben rushes up the stairs finds Vivien sitting on some STACKS
of old newspapers

BEN
What happened Are you okay

She points to the rubber man -- he’s actually just a large
rubber suit -- known as a RUBBER ASPHYXIATION SUIT hanging
from a hook The suit is black covers the entire body and
has a mask with two small eye holes and two tiny breathing
straws that can be pinched to temporarily suffocate the
wearer

BEN (CONTD)
Guess those guys were into the
kinky stuff
(then)
Should I try it on

VIVIEN
Stop it It’s not funny

But they laugh A beat then Violet peeks her head in
VIOLET
What happened
(seeing the suit)
Holy shit

VIVIEN
Get it out of here

EXT HOUSE -- NIGHT
Ben tosses the suit in the GARBAGE

Vivien works on her wall She’s making progress more images
are being revealed -- all of them depicting some form of
PAIN some of them with a strangely SEXUAL component PULL
BACK to reveal Ben standing behind her looking

My professional opinion is that
whoever painted that wall had some
deep psychological issues

She turns surprised to see him

VIVIEN
I thought you had a patient

BEN
They bailed You want some help

She motions to her tools He grabs one Starts working They
steal looks at each other

BEN (CONT’D)
This thing doesn’t freak you out

VIVIEN
It’s weird -- I know it should but
for some reason I find it kind of
comforting

BEN

One of my psych professors told me
that people tell stories to cope
with their fears All art and myths
are just creations to give us some
sense of control over the things
we‘re scared of Afraid of dying
Create reincarnation Afraid of
evil Create a benevolent God who
sends evil doers to Hell I’ve
treated soldiers with PTSD by
having them draw pictures of what
happened over there

VIVIEN
I think I just like that I don’t
have to think while I do it

He stares at her smiles She doesn’t understand

BEN
I always thought you were the
prettiest like this -- no make up

hair in a messy braid

VIVIEN
I’m old

He puts down his scraper moves in close --

BEN

VIVIEN
No Ben Okay No

She pulls away A beat then he SWEEPS all of her tools and
water off the table He’s in a RAGE

BEN
How long Vivien How long are you
going to punish me

VIVIEN
I’m not punishing you you
narcissistic asshole -- I’m having

trouble forgiving you for sleeping
with one of your goddamn patients
You want me to have sex with you
When I can’t even look at your face
without seeing the look on it when
you were pile driving her in our
bed

BEN
I screwed up I’m sorry I was
hurting too

VIVIEN
I’m sorry did the life you were
growing die inside of your belly
and did you have to carry that
corpse inside of you Did you have
to go into labor Give birth to
your dead baby

BEN
My baby died too He was my son
too

VIVIEN

And you buried your sorrow in some
twenty-year-old’s pussy

BEN
I can show you statistics on how
many men cheat after a miscarriage
I was there for you I was patient
and understanding and caring and I
put your feelings first

VIVIEN
My hero

BEN
(so frustrated)
I don’t know how to say this
without coming off like an asshole

VIVIEN
Never stopped you before
(then)
You’re angry at me -- fine yell at

me Six months in therapy of you
crying and apologizing was all
bullshit Give me the real story
now

A beat and then it comes out --

BEN
You got a dog I needed you and you

have been curling up with at night
I needed you I was suffering and
you weren’t there

VIVIEN
Now it all makes sense She was
revenge

BEN
We haven’t had sex in almost a
year

VIVIEN

Youre keeping track

BEN
October 20th And we had great sex
Viv It was loving and sexy and
personal and even a littleweird

She laughs lightly through her tears

BEN (CONTD)
I love you I moved across the
country for you because in all my
life the only thing I’ve been truly
scared of is losing you Losing
this family

(then)

Something horrible happened to us
More horrible than anything on this
wall and then we handled it even
more horribly But this place is
our second chance It’s not
supposed to happen overnight but
it’s like this wallpaper a little
bit at a time I just need to know
that you want it too

She looks up at him her eyes wet She can’t move Wants to
run to him but she’s paralyzed by the fear of being
vulnerable to him again

He makes his move kisses her She’s overwhelmed His touch
finally letting herself feel it after so long

Both of them crying as they fall to the floor Kissing
Clothes coming off Buckles and zippers fumbled with

There on the floor they make love again As they both reach
climax we CUT TO

so are his hands Burns that severe can’t heal The Burnt Man
notices Ben’s hand

BURNT MAN (CONTD)

I’m Larry Harvey -- and you have to
get out of that house

is a crime -- even in San
Francisco

LARRY
They’re not going to put me back in
jail I have brain cancer --
terminal and inoperable

BEN
I’m sorry

LARRY
Don’t be That’s the only reason
they let me out

(a beat)

Homicide Triple homicide San
Quentin for forty-two-years without
a cold then two months ago they
diagnose me with these tumors in my
head Some people would call that
fate

BEN
God gave you cancer so you could
get out of prison and tell me to
move

LARRY
Maybe I don’t know I’ve seen
stranger things

BEN
Sounds more like a man who is
searching for a chance at
redemption for the awful things
he’s done

Larry chuckles There’s no redemption for him He pauses
then looks at Ben directly

LARRY
I made it six months in the house
you live in now before I started
hearing the voices My wife thought
I was working too hard My daughter
Angie -- she was six The older one
Margaret was ten

(MORE)

LARRY (CONTD)
Looked like her mother Funny how
it skips a generation like that

BEN

Look I get that you’re lonely and
you’re struggling Getting out of
prison after all of those years
I’m sure

LARRY
I killed them all

Off Ben shocked we FLASH TO
INT THE HOUSE -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

We see him enter his children’s room --
INT KIDS’ ROOM -- NIGHT

LARRY
I don’t know how I put the myself

like a movie Have you been
sleepwalking

The question hits Ben hard

LARRY (CONTD)
I’ve seen your family Pretty wife
You seem like good people If you
don’t get out of that house you’re
all going to die in there

BEN
There are some pretty serious side
effects to brain tumors People
hallucinate act strangely invent
whole worlds in their heads

LARRY
Look up my case Read the
transcripts

Ben gets up

BEN
I’m a doctor They might not put
you back in jail but I could
certainly get you committed to a
state mental institution Trust
me those places make prison look
like Club Med Leave my family
alone

Larry jumps up desperate

LARRY
Please Please get out of there
That place is evil

BEN
Get off of me I’m not kidding
leave us alone

A beat before Larry calls after him --

LARRY
You never answered me -- what
happened to your hand

Ben looks down at his hand Fear plays across Ben’s face
before he jogs off -- speeding up as he goes

you’re pregnant

She smiles tears forming in her eyes He’s stunned

BEN (CONT’D)

She nods emotional She’s pregnant

Her face opens up in a huge grin the first time we’ve seen
her truly happy He bolts up hugs her kisses her Finally
after all this effort they’re back

MOVE off them Out of the kitchen Into the LIBRARY We look
at the wall for a beat before The RUBBER MAN appears a jolt
Off his face looking right through us we SMASH TO BLACK
