Written by

Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber

First Draft

SIMPLE BLACK ON WHITE CREDITS ROLL TO BIG STARS IM IN

WITH A GIRL When all is said and done up comes a single
number in parenthesis like so

EXT PARK - DAY

For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on

park bench Their names are TOM and SUMMER Neither one says
a word

CLOSE ON her HAND covering his Notice the wedding ring No
words are spoken Tom looks at her the way every woman wants
to be looked at

A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us

NARRATOR
This is a story of boy meets girl

CUT TO

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The boy is TOM HANSEN He sits at a very long rectangular
conference table The walls are lined with framed blow-up
sized greeting cards Tom dark hair and blue eyes wears a

shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
balance out the corporate dress code He looks pretty bored
phones

NARRATOR
The boy Tom Hansen of Margate New
Jersey grew up believing that hed
never truly be happy until the day
he met his soulmate

CUT TO

INT LIVING ROOM - 1989

PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie His
walls are covered in posters of obscure bands From the TV
we hear Elaine Elaine

NARRATOR
This belief stemmed from early
exposure to sad British pop music
and a total misreading of the
movie The Graduate

CUT TO

INT OFFICE CUBICLE - PRESENT DAY
The girl is SUMMER FINN She files folders and answers

in a plain white office She has cropped blonde hair almost
like a boys but her face is feminine and pretty enough to
get away with it

NARRATOR
The girl Summer Finn of
Shinnecock Michigan did not share
this belief

CUT TO

INT BATHROOM - 1994

Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror Her hair
extends down to her lower back

NARRATOR
call

Since the disintegration of her
parents marriage shed only loved
two things The first was her long
blonde hair

She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice

NARRATOR
The second was how easily she could
cut it off And feel nothing

CUT TO

SPLITSCREEN INT BOARDROOM INT CUBICLE - SAME

On the right side of the screen Tom continues to listen to
some boring presentation On the left Summer answers a

takes a message and walks out of her cubicle down a long
narrow hallway

NARRATOR
Tom meets Summer on January 8th in
a San Francisco office building In
an instant he will know shes the
one hes been looking for

CU Summer opening the door to the boardroom about to come

holiday to recognize that

Mckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait

of

Martina Navratilova Ellen DeGeneres and the kid from
Jerry

Maguire

MCKENZIE

singing the song

Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by The DRIVERS also

I think we do a bad thing here
People should be able to say how
they feel how they really feel
without some strangers putting
words in their mouths The truth A
card is a nice thought but it
shouldnt do the dirty work for
you You love someone tell them
yourself in your own words Maybe
its not love at all Maybe theres
no such thing as love Maybe
its galoogoo

A few more silent beats Somethings in the air

INT MOVIE - LATER

Tom and Summer watching the film Tears begin to well in
Summers eyes They soon turn to audible sobs Tom turns to
look at her to offer some sort of comfort believing it to
be a response to the movie She doesnt look back

INT TOMS BEDROOM - DAY

Tom drawing a straight line on his wall Redecorating

And then he stops

He looks at the line hes drawn He extends it a little bit
He draws another He begins to furiously draw on the wall
From out of nowhere inspiration has hit An image starts to
form A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper
almost shaped like a tear drop

EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER

Same day from the past They walk out at first everythings
alright Its exactly as we saw on page 7 But soon after
that she begins to cry again Serious real sobbing

TOM
Hey

He goes to hug her He hugs her Its unclear if she hugs
back

TOM
Hey Sum its just a movie

SUMMER
I know Im sorry Tom

TOM

She smiles tries to pull herself together

INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT

Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles
He grabs one

TOM
It pains me that we live in a world
where no ones ever heard of
Spearmint

SUMMER
Ive never heard of them

TOM
And its painful Oh look

He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her just as
weve seen on Page 7 She smiles and they continue on down
happens

the aisles

In CU Tom goes to hold Summers hand But something

It could be a total coincidence but just as his hand
approaches hers (in SLO-MO) she moves it away and keeps it

at her side Tom puts his hands in his pockets unsure if
theres something to read in that

EXT HARBOR - DAY

Tom sketches intensely The landscape the skyline the
works Hes in the zone

Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring
the distance between the beams of the bridge

Tom jogs A little faster this time

9 INT TOMS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine
crossing off yet another firm from the list Few remain He

sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped For a beat lost
in thought

Then as if to shut those thoughts out whatever they were
he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness

Thinking

On the RIGHT Summer In her wedding dress The veil is
lifted And shes a bride

END MUSIC

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY

Tom in a suit exits a building after another dismal
interview We can see he is frustrated but not deterred In
the distance his favorite spot in the city where he took
Summer ages ago

EXT PARK - DAY

Tom walks over and sits down on a bench He stares off lost
in thought And then from out of nowhere theres her

SUMMER (VO)
Hey

Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench She

may have just sat down she may have been there for hours

Tom isnt sure if shes real He doesnt quite know what to
do

SUMMER
(re suit)
Where you coming from

TOM
What Oh Nowhere How long have
you been sitting there

SUMMER
Awhile

Tom finds it hard to look at her

SUMMER
I come here a lot I always loved
this place ever since you brought
me here

The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty
TOM

So I should probably say
congratulations
SUMMER

Probably But only if you mean it

TOM
I dont know if I do honestly

SUMMER
I understand

TOM
Yeah wellanywayI hope youre
happy

SUMMER

I woke up one day and I knew

Tom says nothing

SUMMER
I knew I could promise him Id feel
the same way every morning In a
way that I I never could with

And theres not much else to say after that
Tom gets up to leave

TOM
You know what sucks Realizing that
everything you believe in is
complete bullshit

SUMMER
What is

TOM
Destiny soulmates true love All
that stuff Its nothing more than
silly childhood fairy tale
nonsense isnt it God

SUMMER
Tom dont go

TOM
I should have listened to you
Summer You were right all along

Summer takes a beat to let this hang there

SUMMER
I was right

And then out of nowhere she begins to hysterically laugh
TOM
What This is funny

Tries to stop but it only makes it worse Nows shes
completely cracking up

TOM
What are you laughing at

And she cant stop Shes totally lost control

TOM
(trying himself not to
LAUGH)
Youre a crazy person

SUMMER
Tom Youre the crazy person

TOM
What are you talking about

SUMMER
One day Im reading a book at the
corner deli and this guy sits down
and starts asking about it Now

TOM
This is funny to you

SUMMER

o the movies instead If I went
omewhere else for lunch If I
howed up to eat ten minutes later
om it was meant to be just like

about

tH HHOods

Tom is speechless Summer takes his hand We may notice her
every

Gethers

wedding ring We may also notice that this is the same exact
shot as the first scene of the screenplay We hold it for a
few seconds more And then the hands separate

SUMMER
Anyway I should probably be
getting back It was good to see

Summer gets up and starts walking away from him After a
SECOND

TOM
Summer

She stops and turns back He takes in her face most likely
for the last time ever

TOM
I really do hope youre happy

SUMMER

(BEAT)

And she walks away The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her leaving
Tom alone in the park getting smaller and farther away

second

NARRATOR
If Tom had learned anything it
was that you cant ascribe great
cosmic significance to a simple
earthly event Coincidence Thats
all anything ever is Nothing more
than coincidence

ANIMATION 1 second clip of the colored sequence Real fast
Hardly noticeable But its there

NARRATOR

It took a long time but Tom had
finally learned There are no
miracles Theres no such thing as
fate Nothing is meant to be He

Tom turns back around

NARRATOR
