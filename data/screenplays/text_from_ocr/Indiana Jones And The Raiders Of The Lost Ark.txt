FADE IN

EXT PERU - HIGH JUNGLE - DAY

The dense lush rain forests of the eastern slopes of
Andes the place known as The Eyebrow of the Jungle

jutting canyon walls are half-hidden by the thick

The MAIN TITLE is followed by this

PERU

A narrow trail across the green face of the canyon A
of men make their way along it At the head of the

an American INDIANA JONES He wears a short leather

a flapped holster and a brimmed felt hat with a weird
stuck in the band Behind him come two Spanish

SATIPO and BARRANCA Bringing up the rear are five
INDIANS They act as porters and are wrangling the two
packed llamas The Indians become increasingly nervous

speak to each other in bursts of Quechua The American

is known to his friends as Indy glances back at them

He turns and yells at the Indians in Quechua his anger
an indication of his own fears The party reaches a

the canyon wall and takes the trail through it

When they emerge their destination is revealed to them
the distance Beyond a thick stand of trees is the
enshrouded TEMPLE OF THE CHACHAPOYAN WARRIORS

The entire party is struck by the sight The Indians
terrified now chatter away Suddenly the three at the

turn and run dropping their packs as they go Barranca
at the fleeing Indians and pulls his pistol out He

to raise his arm to aim but Indy restrains it ina
grip

INDY
No

Barranca looks evilly at Indys hand upon him Indy
him and smiles in a friendly way

INDY
We dont need them

Satipo watches this confrontation with some concern

BARRANCA
I do not carry supplies

INDY
Well leave them Once weve got it
well be able to reach the plane by
dusk
He turns back to the trail Satipo gets the two
Indians moving behind Indy Satipo and Barranca then
fast silent communication Barranca indicates his

THE APPROACH TO THE TEMPLE
The party fans out to fight their way through the
trees that guard the temple Visibility is cut to five
in the heavy mist Satipo extracts a short native dart
a tree and examines the point gingerly
SATIPO
(showing Indy)

The Hovitos are near The poison is

still fresh three days Theyre

following us I tell you

INDY

If they knew we were here they would

have killed us already
The two Indiana jabber in Quechua near hysteria
is sweating profusely eyes darting He yells at the
in Quechua to shut up
In the undergrowth there is slithering movement
Indian 1 draws aside a branch and is faced with a
stone sculpture of a Chachapoyan demon The Indian is
frightened no sound comes out when he screams He turns
runs silently away
Indian 2 calls to his friend Getting no response he
in that direction A huge macaw flushed from the
screams and flies away Indian 2 does exactly the same
never to be seen again

Indy Satipo and Barranca just clearing the trees

BARRANCA
(nervous)
No one has ever come out of there
alive Why should we put our faith
in you

Indy takes the weird feather from the band of his hat

around its point he slips a tightly rolled piece of
parchment Barranca and Satipo exchange a quick So

where is was look They all kneel as Indy spreads out
parchment On it is one-half of a crude floorplan of
Temple
INDY
No one ever had what we have
partners
Indy fixes them with an expectant stare Satipo
similar but folded piece of parchment He lays it -
other half of the floorplan - next to Indys They all
it for a moment then Indy stands and walks toward the
Barrancas eyes are shining as they dart between the
and Satipo

He raises it toward Indy as Satipo realizes with alarm

hes doing Too late Indys head turns and he sees

Indys next move is amazing graceful and fast yet
unhurried His right hand slides up under the back of
leather jacket and emerges grasping the handle of a
curled bullwhip With the same fluid move that brings
body around to face the Peruvian the whip uncoils to
full ten foot length and flashes out

The fall of the whip (the unplaited strip at the end of
lash) wraps itself around Barrancas hand and pistol
could not drop the gun now if he tried

Indy gives the whip a short pull and Barrancas arm in
down where it involuntarily discharges the gun into
dirt Barranca is amazed but feels some slack in the
and immediately raises the gun toward Indy again

with his free hand

Indys face goes hard And sad

Indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc Barranca spins
enclosed in the whip his gun hand stuck tight against
body Indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle
Barrancas gun fires Barranca falls dead

Indy looks quickly at Satipo who is shocked and

He raises his arms in supplication

INT TEMPLE - INCLINED PASSAGE - DAY

Indy and Satipo carrying a torch walk up the slightly
inclined tubular passage from the main entrance The

is wet and dark hanging with plant life and
Their echoing footsteps intermittently overpower the

of loud dripping whistling air drafts and scampering

HALL OF SHADOWS

Indy leads the way down a twisting hallway Satipos
barely lighting his way from behind Indy disappears in
shadow and when he reappears a moment later a huge
tarantula is crawling up the back of his jacket Indy
notice and disappears into another shadow emerging
more tarantulas on his back

Satipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound
looks at him sees what hes pointing at and casually
all three spiders off with his rolled whip as he would
fly Satipo pirouettes for an inspection and Indy

off the Peruvians back

Indy begins picking up little pocket-sized artifacts
the niches and ledges of the Temple He continues to do
as the men penetrate the Temple His collecting is

expert evaluating the pieces in an instant discarding
stuffing others into his clothes and never stopping

his
forward progress
CHAMBER OF LIGHT
The men reach an arch in the hall The small chamber
ahead
which interrupts the hall is brightly lit by a shaft
of
sunlight from high above Indy stops looks it over
SATIPO
Whats wrong Are you lost
Indy picks up a stick and throws it through the shaft
of
light Giant spikes spring together from the sides of
the
chamber with a ferocious CLANG And impaled on the
spikes
are the remains of a white man half-fleshed half
skeleton
in explorer-type grab Indy reaches out and takes hold
of
the mans carcass As the spikes slowly retract Indy
pulls
it free and seats the remains gently on the floor
INDY
Forrestal
SATIPO
(gulps)
We can go no further
INDY
Now Satipo we dont want to be
discouraged by every little thing
Indy steps sideways into the chamber His back pressed
against
the very points of the retracted spikes he moves along
the
edge of the light beam and steps clear on the other
side

Satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way through
STAIRWAY

Indy and Satipo come down stone stairs to a tight
landing
Framing the entry are a carefully strung network of

dead
vines each somehow hooked into the wall narrowing the
opening even more
INDY
(taking torch)
Let me see that
He lowers the torch to the floor of the landing The
landing

is carpeted with human skeletons one on top of
another all
squashed flat as cardboard Satipo gasps Indy looks up

at
the ceiling of the landing then steps onto skeletons
which
make a cracking noise under his feet
INDY
Try not to touch the vines
FOYER OF THE SANCTUARY
The men are in a high straight hallway 50 feet long
The door at the end is flooded with sunlight
SATIPO
Sefior I think we are very close
Indy stands still looking at the hall
SATIPO
(impatient)
Let us hurry There is nothing to
fear here
INDY
Thats what scares me
They begin walking down the hall side by side Satipo
has
inched a little ahead Suddenly his lead foot comes
down and
through the floor As Satipo begins to pitch forward
Indy
grabs him by the belt and pulls him back They both

Indy swings his whip across the floor Fifteen feet of
cuts open beneath the lash falling away to reveal

as wide as the hall The illusory floor was made of
covered cobwebs Satipo picks up a stone and drops it
the pit No sound The two men exchange glances Indy

up at the high roof of the hall He swings the whip up

a support beam tests its strength with a pull and

over the pit on the whip From the other side he swings
whip back to Satipo who throws Indy the torch Satipo
across When they are both standing on solid floor

a moment of quiet in which they hear from far far
SPLASH Indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and
it strung to the beam for quick retreat

THE SANCTUARY

A large domed room Ten evenly-spaced skylights send
shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor white
black tiles laid out in a lovely intricate pattern
and Satipo stand at the door and look across the wide
at the altar There in the supreme hallowed spot is a
jeweled figurine Indys real objective

Two torches many years old are in holders by the

Indy takes one down and lights it He gives the regular

to be doing a martial arts kata Before each big move
waves the torch in front of him head to toe looking at
flame Halfway out he sees something on the floor and

to look at it

A dead bird lies on one of the white tiles Its body is
riddled with little deadly darts This has great

the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air

whips at the flame Indy ducks under it and leaves a
mark on the white tile beneath it

mysterious mechanism rumbles into action deep in the

Indy spins and starts his kata back across the

Satipos eyes widen in terror He turns and runs

THE RETREAT - INTERCUTTING INDY AND SATIPO

The sanctuary has begun to rumble and shake in response
the mysterious mechanism Just as Indy goes out the
rock shakes loose from the wall and rolls onto the
floor Immediately a noisy torrent of poison darts
the room

Satipo extremely nervous regards the whip a moment
turns back to face Indy who has run up to the far side
the pit
SATIPO
No time to argue Throw me the idol
I throw you the whip

Indy hesitates eyeing the rumbling walls

SATIPO
You have no choice Hurry

Indy concurs with that assessment He tosses the idol
the pit to Satipo Satipo stuffs it in the front pocket
his jacket gives Indy a look then drops the whip on
floor and runs

SATIPO
Adios amigo

Indy grimaces He had a feeling this might happen He

AT THE VINED LANDING

Satipo flies through like a chubby ballet dancer and
the steps five at a time

IN THE FOYER

Indy runs in full stride to the edge of the pit and
jumps into space He doesnt make it His body hits the
side of the pit and he begins to slide out of view
wild clawing with his fingers at the edge of the pit
his descent With just the tips of his fingers over the
he begins pulling himself up

himself he hears from above the giant spikes of the
of Light CLANG and an abrupt sickening rendition of
LAST SCREAM Indy runs up the steps The rumbling sound
louder

Satipos body to one side Indy edges into the chamber
his back to the shaft of light Soon he is face to face

pocket and moves quickly out the other side

INDY
Adios

THE INCLINED PASSAGE

Indy shoots out of a cut-off hallway and turns toward
exit The rumbling is very loud and now we see why
behind Indy a huge boulder comes roaring around a

the passage perfectly form-fitted to the passageway
obliterates everything before it sending the

shooting ahead like missiles Indy dashes for the light

the exit His hat flies off his head Almost
is crushed by the boulder Indy dives out the end of

the

passage as the boulder slams to a perfect fit at the
entrance

sealing the Temple

EXT FRONT OF THE TEMPLE - DAY

Indy lies on the ground gasping for air A shadow
falls

across him and he looks up

WHAT HE SEES

Looming above him are three figures Two are HOVITOS
WARRIORS

in full battle paint and loin cloths They carry long
blow

guns But the man in the center draws Indys attention
He

is a tall impressive white man dressed in full safari
outfit

including pith helmet His name is EMILE BELLOQ His
face is

thin powerful his eyes hypnotic his smile charming
yet

lethal His heavily French-accented speech is deep

mellifluous wonderful Back beyond Belloq and his two

escorts thirty more Hovitos Warriors hover at the edge
of

the trees

BELLOQ
Dr Jones you choose the wrong
friends This time it will cost you

Bellog extends his hand Indy looks at it then
produces the

idol and hands it to Bellog Bellogq extends his other
hand

smiling Indy hands over his gun Belloq sticks it in
his

jacket

BELLOQ
And you thought Id given up

BELLOQ
(smiles)
Yes too bad You could warn them
if only you spoke Hovitos
With that Bellog turns dramatically and holds the idol

for all the Hovitos to see and says something in

There is a murmur of recognition and all the Indians
including Belloqs escorts prostrate themselves upon

ground heads down
Indy is immediately up and running toward the edge of
clearing
BELLOQ
(in Hovitos)

Kill him
AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING
Indy disappears into the foliage An instant later the
are peppered with a rain of poison darts and spears
EXT THE JUNGLE - INDYS RUN - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Indy runs like hell through steadily falling terrain

always close behind a swift gang of angry Hovitos
Occasionally they get close enough to send a dart or

whizzing past Indys head
EXT THE URUBAMBA RIVER - DUSK

spot in the room right now is Indys desk which has
cleared off expressly for the benefit of -

MARCUS BRODY

The Curator of the National Museum in Washington DC
is examining the small artifacts Indy pocketed on his
into the Peruvian Temple He occasionally uses a
eyepiece to get a closer look But he is distracted
concerns elsewhere and it is this that his old friend

senses from across the room

BRODY
Do you think the idol will ever show
up

INDY

I dont know Just because Belloqg
had it doesnt mean he kept it

Indy snaps the book closed and puts it on the shelf He
his glasses off and focuses on Brody At the windowed

to his office two pretty Coeds pause for a moment
at their sexy Archeology professor giggle and

disappear
INDY
Getting it away from those Indians
would be a neat trick

INT INDYS LECTURE HALL CLASSROOM - DAY

Indys course - a combination of archeology and

anthropology -

is taught in this amphitheater-type lecture hall His
desk

and lectern hold large reference books blackboards
line the

wall Bones maps charts festoon the walls

Indy leans against his desk talking with Brody and two

uniformed Army officers COLONEL MUSGROVE and MAJOR
EATON

who are situated around the first seats in the
classroom

MUSGROVE
But you did study under Professor
Ravenwood at the University of
Chicago

INDY
(nods)
We havent spoken in ten years Im
afraid we had a bit of a falling
out

EATON
You know nothing of his whereabouts
INDY

(negative)
Just rumors Somewhere in Asia last
I heard

Musgrove and Eaton exchange a look theyre

disappointed
EATON
(to Musgrove)
Maybe Dr Jones can make sense of
it
Again the military men have a silent communication
deciding

what to reveal

MUSGROVE
Well you must understand Dr
Jones this is all strictly
confidential

INDY

I understand

MUSGROVE
Yesterday one of our European
sections intercepted a Nazi communiqué
from Cairo to Berlin We dont quite
know what to make of it

Musgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase

MUSGROVE
Here it is - Tanis development
proceeding Acquire headpiece Staff
of Ra General Tengtu Hok Shanghai
Locate Abner Ravenwood US

Brody is excited He looks at Indy
BRODY
Tanis They must have discovered the
lost ruins
Indy contemplates this big news hes impressed
INDY
(to himself)

Tanis Aint that somethin

EATON
Frankly were a little suspicious
An American being mentioned so
prominently in a secret Nazi cable

INDY
Ah Ravenwoods no Nazi

EATON
Then what do they want him for

INDY
Theyre looking for the headpiece to
the Staff of Ra

MUSGROVE
(indicates his sheet)
But it says here thats in China

INDY
Only half of it Ravenwood had the
other half

EATON

What would the Nazis want with this -
this Staff of Ra

BRODY
I can tell you that Over the last
two years the Nazis have had teams
of archeologists running around the
world looking for all kinds of
religious artifacts

MUSGROVE
Thats right Hitlers a nut on the
subject Crazy Hes obsessed with
the occult

EATON
What is this Staff of Ra anyway

INDY
It all has to do with the Ark of the
Covenant
(the Army guys look
mystified)
The chest the Hebrews used to carry
around the Ten Commandments

Now its the Army men who are impressed

INDY
to

(and we

teacher

Indy moves to the

get a glimpse of w

An Egyptian pharaoh stole the Ark
from Jerusalem and took it back to
the city of Tanis A short time later
Tanis was consumed by the desert in

a sandstorm that lasted a year But
before that the Pharaoh had had the
Ark hidden away in a secret chamber
called the Well of the Souls Which
is where the Staff of Ra comes in

give a rough idea of the system as he describes it

he must be)

INDY

Now this was rather clever The Staff
was really just a big stick - oh I
dont know say like this -

(he indicates about

six feet)
no one really knows for sure Any
way it was capped by an elaborate
headpiece with a carving of the sun
at the top What you had to do was
take the Staff to a special map room
in Tanis - it had the whole city
laid out in miniature on the floor
When you placed the Staff in a certain
spot in this room at a certain time
of day the sun would shine through
a hole here in the headpiece and
then send a beam of light down here -
to the map - giving you the location
of the Well of the Souls

MUSGROVE
where the Ark of the Covenant was
kept

Which is probably what the Nazis are
after

Indy pulls a big format book from the stack on his
and flips through the pages until he finds a large
print The other men gather to look
THE PRINT
Fills the screen
It shows a Biblical battle The Israelite Army is
an opposition force At the forefront of the Israelite
two men carry the Ark of the Covenant a beautiful gold
crowned by two sculptured gold angels The men do not
the Ark itself rather they carry it by use of two long
poles which pass through rings in the corners of the
The painting is very dramatic full of smoke tumult
sinewy dying men But the most astounding thing in the
is the brilliant jet of white light and flame issuing
the wings of the angels It pierces deep into the ranks
the retreating enemy wreaking devastation and terror

EATON
Good God

INDY
Yes Thats what the Hebrews thought

MUSGROVE
Whats that supposed to be coming
out of there

INDY
Who knows lightning fire
the power of God

EATON
Im beginning to understand Hitlers
interest in this thing
INDY
Oh yes The Bible tells of it leveling
mountains and wasting entire regions
Moses promised that when the Ark was
with you your enemies will be
scattered and your foes fell before
you

(pause)

An army which carries the Ark before
it is invincible

Eaton and Musgrove exchange worried looks

INDY

Oh theres one other thing that
Hitler undoubtably believes about
the Ark

(a long pregnant pause)
Its said that the Lost Ark will be
recovered at the time of the coming
of the True Messiah

MUSGROVE
Dr Jones youve been very helpful
I hope we can call on you again if
we have questions

INDY
Most certainly

Brody and Indy exchange a look as they all shake and

Brody

starts to leave with the Army men

smugglers and fugitives and of course mountain

from every corner of the earth A tall Nepalese
MAHDLO is

In a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out

suddenly

between the groups at two neighboring tables Ferocious

representatives from each table - one a wild-looking
SHERPA

the other a muscular Australian CLIMBER - jump up to
face

each other As the two contenders stand poised for
action

their respective supporters shift in their places

The bar has quieted ominously and so we hear with
clarity when - a door behind the bar slams open with a
BANG and some Presence too small to be seen as it
through the forest of towering patrons makes a beeline
the troubled corner of the bar A path clears for it
The Sherpa and the Climber are about to kill each other
the Presence arrives directly between them she is

RAVENWOOD twenty-five years old beautiful if a bit

looking At this moment however that look does not
She is not intimidated by the combatants she jabs
fingers into their chests She is angry as hell The
shrink under her gaze
MARION

That does it Ive been patient with

you no-goods long enough Im not

open at 2 oclock for myself you

know Its all for you And how do

you repay me Trouble and noise and

blood on my floor I wont have it

Everybody out Out Out Were closed

Closed Do your killing outside And

dont leave any bodies on the porch
The place clears quickly Stragglers and grumblers are
special attention by Marion and Mahdlo who has come
behind the bar carrying a big axe handle Mahdlo herds
crows out the front door as Marion turns and walks
the bar
A scowl on her lovely face she has just begun clearing

bar of glasses when she notices one remaining Patron

over a glass at the far end of the bar Grimacing in
exasperation she heads that way like a locomotive

MARION
Hey you deaf one I said out of my
place I dont mean next Easter I
mean now -
She is almost on him when Indy looks up smiling Marion

stares shocked

INDY
Hello Marion

She hits him with a solid right to the jaw knocking
the barstool on the floor He rubs his jaw and smiles
her

INDY
Nice to see you too

MARION
Get up and get out

INDY
(getting up)
Take it easy Im looking for your
father
MARION
(bitterly)
Well youre two years too late
Indys attitude changes instantly This is sad news He
silent for a long time Mahdlo comes in the front door
hurries forward when he sees Indy with Marion He looks
her for guidance but she stays him with a gesture
MARION
Go home Mahdlo Ill see you
tomorrow
Mahdlo is hesitant but lays the axe handle on the bar
goes out Indy has been barely aware of him Now he

again on the barstool Marion has a vindictive look

let him stay but she wants to inflict as much pain as
possible

INDY
What happened

MARION
Avalanche Up there He was digging
What else He spent his whole life
digging Dragging me all over this
rotten earth For what

INDY
Do you find him

MARION

Hell no Hes buried where he was
working Probably preserved real
good too In the snow

Suddenly the hardness cracks She is on the verge of

tears

and does not want him to see them She turns away and
takes

a whiskey bottle from the shelf then turns back to
pout

herself a drink

INDY
Not a bad way to go Doing what he
loved

MARION

(vitriolic)
Dont give me that stuff What do
you know

(she takes a drinks)
Im the one that was left in a bad
way He didnt have a penny Guess
how I lived Mister Jones I worked
here And I wasnt the bartender

(another swallow)
Finally the guy that owned the joint
went crazy Snow crazy They took
his away screaming As they dragged
him out he said the place was all
mine for life

She looks around the saloon
MARION

Can you imagine a more evil curse
(pause)
So far its working

INDY
Why not leave Go back to the States

MARION
Ill go back Ill get there Not
that theres a soul there who knows
my name or cares But Ill go And
when I do theyll know me Cause
Im going to go back in style With
money A goddamn lady

INDY
Where you gonna get it

MARION
If I knew that you think Id still
be running this dive

Indy looks at her thinking Under his gaze she
blushes
for reasons only she understands She looks into her

glass
and for a moment she softens

MARION

Ill tell you something Indy Ive
learned to hate you in the last ten
years But somehow no matter how
much I hated you I always knew that
someday youd come through that door
I never doubted that Something made
is inevitable

(hopefully)
Why are you here now tonight

Indy takes a long time to answer

INDY
I need one of the pieces your father
collected

Marions eyes go icy She swings at him again with her
right

but this time he catches her at the wrist Then he
stops her

left which she has brought up to slap him

MARION
You son-of-a-bitch You know what
you did to me to my life This is
your handiwork

INDY
I never meant to hurt you

MARION
I was a child

INDY
You knew what you were doing

MARION
I was in love

INDY
I guess that depends on your
definition

MARION

It was wrong You knew it
Indy releases her arms

INDY
Look I did what I did I dont expect
you to be happy about it But maybe
we can do each other some good

MARION
Why start now

INDY
Shut up and listen for a second I
want that piece your father had
Ive got money

This stops her

MARION
How much

INDY
Enough to get you back to the States
Where are his things

MARION
Gone I sold it all It was all junk
The junk he wasted his life on

Thats too bad

Indy feels tired defeated Marion is pleased

Indy has to smile at her glee

She pours

A huge smile lights up Marions face

MARION

drink)
Ive got to think this out Im used
to bargaining with yaks

INDY
Okay five thousand Thats all I

Indy nods gets up to go

MARION
Wait a minute Leave the five thousand

back -

drink Then slowly her hand comes up to loosen the
that is draped around her throat It falls away

her graceful neck above the dipping top of her blouse
there on a gold chain against her white skin is a sun-
golden medallion The bottom looks broken off Marion

the medallion so she can see it in her hand then looks
thoughtfully after Indy

Suddenly tears well up in her eyes She lets the poker
from her hand wipes away the tears She walks across
room to the end of the bar still cluttered with
glasses and stops at the pile of American money Indy
left She takes the chain from around her neck and lets
medallion slide off it into her hand She places it on
bar next to the pile of money thinking Then having
some decision she picks up the pile of bills walks up
back of the bar and pulls a small wooden box from under
bar She flips open the top puts the cash inside and

Four Bad Men come in Marion halfway between the
possessions and not wishing to draw attention to

stops where she is

The Four Bad Men who advance on her are

1) the obvious leader a short vile sadistic German
spectacles by the name of BELZIG

2) a trenchcoated SECOND NAZI

3) a ratty-looking NEPALESE and

4) a mean MONGOLIAN The second NAZI and the MONGOLIAN
carry submachine guns

BELZIG
Good evening Fraulein

MARION
The bars closed

BELZIG
We are not thirsty

The Mongolian and the Nepalese poke around checking to

make
sure theres no one else there
Down at the end of the bar the medallion lies
partially
hidden by surrounding glasses and bottles The Second
Nazi
stops very near it but turns his back to it to face
Belzig
and Marion
MARION
What do you want
BELZIG
The same thing your friend Dr Jones
wanted Surely he told you there
would be other interested parties
Marion shakes her head
BELZIG
Ah the man is nefarious I hope for
your sake he has not yet acquired
it
MARION
Why are you willing to offer more
BELZIG
Almost certainly Do you still have
it
MARION
No But I know where it is
Belzigs smile fades at this news Hes not a patient
sort
Marion is chilled by the look She turns and moves to

intently

MARION
How ‘bout a drink for you and your
men

The Second Nazi lights up at this suggestion Belzig
him a withering look

BELZIG
We will stick to the business at
hand Fraulein

MARION

Fine Why dont you come back tomorrow
when Jones is here and well have an
auction

Belzig gives her a cold look then turns and walks over
the fireplace As soon as his back is turned the
Nazi grabs the nearest whiskey bottle and takes a quick
In so doing he leaves the medallion completely
Marion is aware of this as she looks at him But he
puts the bottle down again obscuring the medallion
Belzig speaks from the fireplace

He motions with his hand The Mongolian moves up behind
and lifts her roughly over the top of the bar knocking
bottles and spilling liquor He deposits her on the

side where the Nepalese and the Second Nazi flank her

hold her cruelly arms behind her back Marion raises a
ruckus

Belzig turns from the fireplace In his hand is the

yelling her eyes widen in terror

A dark smoke-filled den on iniquity The patrons

all fearsome Arabs sit in small shadowy groups around

He is drunk The ARAB BARTENDER places a new bottle of

expensive bourbon in front of him Indy eyes is

ARAB BARTENDER
The gentleman in the corner sent it
He would like you to join him
INDY
(doesnt even look)
Too bad Im drinking alone
The Arab Bartender does a take looking at the three
GERMAN HENCHMEN who have surrounded Indy from out of
smoke their hands stuffed in bulging trenchcoat

Indy notices them now with a bleary glance He decides

in no shape to kill or be killed and moves with them
the room taking his bottle with him The Arab patrons

take
this in and mind their own business
The occupant of the smoke-shrouded corner table becomes
visible only as Indy reaches there it is Emile Belloq
He
is drinking wine
INDY
Belloq
BELLOQ
Good evening Dr Jones
INDY
I ought to kill you right now
BELLOQ
It was not I who brought the girl
into this dirty business
Indy knows its true thats whats tearing him up
BELLOQ
Sit down please before you fall
down We can behave as civilized
people Im afraid it will be your
last opportunity
Indy sits glancing at the German Henchmen who settle
nearby

just out of earshot

INDY
Not a very private place for a murder

BELLOQ

(looking around)
These Arabs will not interfere in
the white mans business They do
not care if we kill each other off

(takes a sip of wine

refers to it)

BELLOQ
How odd that is should end this way
for us after so many stimulating

encounters I almost regret it Where
shall I find a new adversary so close
to my own level

INDY
Try the local sewer

BELLOQ
I know you despise me We always
hate in others that which we most
fear in ourselves And you and I are
very much alike

INDY
Now youre getting nasty

BELLOQ
We have always done the same kind of
work Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend I am a shadowy
reflection of you But it would have
taken only a nudge to make you the
same as me to push you out of the
light

Theres a certain amount of truth to this the
of it flickers across Indys bleary eyes Belloq sees
there

BELLOQ
You know it to be true How nice
And how ironic the timing

Bellog leans forward eyes shining voice suddenly

BELLOQ
Do you realize what the Ark is
(very intense)
Its a transmitter A radio for
talking to God And now it is within
my grasp

INDY
What about your boss der Fuhrer I
thought he was waiting to take
possession

Bellogq glances into the gloom at the German Henchmen

BELLOQ
(quieter)
When the time is right When I am
finished with it

INDY
I hope your friends are patient
Dangerous work Belloq

BELLOQ
Yes Very You may consider yourself
fortunate that your involvement
concludes here

Tell me did you get away with the
idol
BELLOQ

I was lucky to get away with my life
The Hovitos proved quite narrow-minded
about the whole matter

without looking up

The Monkeys paw comes up over the edge of the table

grabs another date

We see the headpiece in closeup on the table Amirs
crooked

fingers trace a line of markings along the bottom

Indy hoots Then he takes the data in his hand and

high in the air He opens his mouth to catch it but it
doesnt come down He has inadvertently thrown it into

bowl of a hanging lamp This makes the men laugh even

Indy goes over and picks up another date He turns

fury
and she grunts obscenities at him

Look you dont know how glad I am
to see you And I dont like doing

EXT INDYS DIG - NIGHT

In the eerie conjunction of moonlight and torchlight
and the other men step back in awe of their discovery
flush with the bottom of their pit is a heavy stone
door to an underground chamber Special prying tools
produced With two men assigned to each of the two long
they work in unison to open the vault They open it a
and the other men rush in to flop the heavy door

open Down inside only blackness

The men quickly prostrate themselves around the edge of
entry to look inside Indy and Sallah each take a torch
hold them down the hole

quite large as Indy and Sallah wave their torches
more of the room is revealed Now the far end of the
comes into view There is a stone altar down there and
this elaborated carved platform is a stone chest big

to enclose the Lost Ark and protect it from the ravages

time This altar appears to be the only place on the
of the Well that is not covered by a strange dark
some kind
INDY
The Ark must be in that stone case

He breaks off realizing exactly what that carpet is He

Indy drops his torch to the floor of the Well This is
answered by the most horrific HISSING imaginable

WHAT HE SEES
That think dark carpet is moving Its alive Its
and thousands of deadly poisonous snakes - Egyptian

And the only thing that seems capable of avoiding this
venomous groundcover is the altar The snakes ebb and

near it but never encroach on it as though repelled
some invisible force
Indy shakes his head and talks to himself
INDY
Why snakes Why did it have to be

After a moment of this he stops He gathers his energy

become electrostatically charged We hear what sounds
low HUM The sea of snakes around the altar draws back
from this presence

As the top of the stone chest is pushed completely off
slams down beside it we see THE LOST ARK OF THE

It is awesomely beautiful breathtaking 4 feet long

feet wide and 25 feet high Its height however is
increased by the two sculptured gold angels mounted

each other on the top Though the body of the Ark is
wood it has been overlaid with gold An elaborate gold
surrounds the top edge and gold carrying rings are

to each corner

Sallah is mesmerized by the sight His hand starts to
out and touch one of the angels but Indy grabs it

INDY
Dont touch it Never touch it

The wooden crate stands open next to the stone chest
Indy extracts the wooden poles from its rings and

fitting them through the rings in the Ark This takes
maneuvering by the two men but soon they are able to

They extract the poles fasten the top of the crate and
the poles through the rings of the wooden crate They

start

back toward the space under the hole

The fire strips have begun to dwindle as have some of

spaces

Indy and Sallah eye them nervously as they hurry along
with

their heavy load Under the hole they hurriedly attach
ropes

to the wooden crate and it is pulled up Indys
concentration

is on the tide of snakes

INDY
Hurry up Why did it have to be

Sallah takes the next rope and climbs quickly out of
the

Well Indy has picked up a torch and now throws it at a
pool

of snakes who are too close for his comfort He turns
and

takes hold of the exit rope He gives it a first tug
and it

falls down into the Well landing partly beyond the

In the cockpit of the Flying Wing the Pilot has been

INT INDYS CABIN - NIGHT

Indy comes in takes off his hat jacket whip and
The door which connects this cabin to the next opens

and
Marion appears She is carrying a half-full glass of
liquor
but what you notice is the long snow-white high-
necked
nightgown she is wearing It is very prim Very
innocent
And very sexy Marion does a slightly embarrassed

turn for Indy
MARION
I have a feeling Im not the first
woman to travel with these pirates
Theres a whole wardrobe in there
INDY
Its lovely
Indy sits on the cot takes off his boots He leans
back
against the wall and rubs his eyes Marion sits on the
bed
leans back against the wall with him and looks down at
her
white nightgown She chuckles
MARION
I feel like a virgin bride in this
INDY
Thats what you look like
MARION
(takes a drink)
There are some things you can
recapture in this life but that
isnt one of them
INDY
What would you like to recapture
MARION
(after a long pause)
Nothing That is the way it is
He watches her closely as she drains her glass and puts
it

down

INDY
Did I ever say I was sorry I burned
down your tavern

She turns so their lips are very close

MARION
No Then again I burned up that
plane

INDY

You saved my life

MARION
And you saved mine

INDY
Seems things have worked out kind of
even

MARION

Thats the way I like them

INDY
Maybe we should consider all past
accounts closed

Marion thinks about this a long time

MARION
No Not yet

She looks into his eyes A smile jumps from her lips to

his

He kisses her and they sink slowly to the cot

two Nazi rafts already next to the ship

Indy flies down some stairs and starts to round a
Suddenly he throws himself backwards out of view
uniformed Nazis are clustered near a cabin door holding
Messenger Pirate Now two more come out of the cabin
to maintain their grasp on a kicking yelling Marion

Pirates spouting racial epithets Indy steps backwards

EXT INT THE BANTU WINDS (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY
The ship is swarming with Nazis The Black Pirates are

Captain Katanga watches as his crew is crowded into a

circle

of Nazis on the wide deck below him He is surrounded
by

Bellog Shliemann and several Nazis two of whom are

Bellogs

eyes shine at the sight

SHLIEMANN

The Ark is taken away

SHLIEMANN

SERGEANT
Not a trace yet sir

KATANGA
Jones is dead

Bellog and Shliemann regard him suspiciously

KATANGA
We killed him He was of no use to
us The girl however has certain
value where we are headed She will
bring a very good price If that
cargo you have taken was your goal
then go in peace with it But leave
us the girl It will reduce our loss
on this trip

SHLIEMANN

EXT THE WURRFLER - CONNING TOWER - DAY
The Nazis have returned to their subs Shliemann is on
bridge with the WURRFLERS CAPTAIN and the Captains
The Captain is an honorable career Navy man
THE WURRFLERS CAPTAIN

Colonel Shliemann all torpedoes are

loaded
Shliemann nods and continues to stare at the Bantu
does the Captain The Pirate crew is all lined across
bow Towering above the others standing on the rail
and defiant is Katanga Shliemann looks at the
Captain a moment

SHLIEMANN

the bridge looks once more at Katanga
On the Bantu Wind Katanga executes what might be taken
a salute
The Wurrflers Captain smiles salutes crisply then
below pulling the hatch closed Immediately the
begins to move And as it does we see the rail at the
of the main deck From nowhere a wet sleeve appears
hand grabs the rail

Indy pulls his dripping body onto the subs main deck

has lost his felt hat once and for all Other than
outfit is the same as always just wetter Suddenly

is washing over his feet the Wurrfler is beginning to
submerge Indy runs through quickly deepening water

the haven of the conning tower Halfway there he slips
goes down Only by grabbing the base of the aftmast
does he keep from being swept away He struggles to his

working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as

ocean whips at his body The periscope is quickly going

Indy hangs on to the top three feet all that remains

The forward movement of the sub continues but to

slowly dawning delight the dive stops No more of the

aching arms from the wet leather of his whip leaving
one loop around his waist to hold him to the sub He

WHAT HE SEES

The sub enters an underwater tunnel that penetrates
cliffs Indy is held to the periscope by his crossed
and the whip His impromptu air bubble is working but
a struggle to maintain it

The sub begins to cut through think marine vegetation
dangling growth pulls at Indys body and slaps at his
bubble Now a clump of entwined seaweed rips the

of his hands and his bubble of air rises away Indy

on holding his breath but the vegetation gets denser
Finally it pulls him off the periscope The sub moves

disappearing ahead

Indy rises desperately through the dark water his hand
outstretched Then almost simultaneously hand and

solid rock But no air Indy feels along the ceiling of
Nothing Its all submerged

Indy dives stroking deep into the tunnel When he has
descended 15 feet he grabs a vine and steadies

eyes search the dim roof of the tunnel He sees his
hope in the distance - a small blue circle an air
He swims for it

The Wurrfler has arrived at an extraordinary base built
the hollow interior of the island This chamber with
docking bay is almost all water A huge natural
has been reinforced and enlarged by the Germans
The Wurrfler sits surfaced at the dock The Ark has
unloaded and placed on a cart Shliemann Belloqg and
have just disembarked and been met by a Nazi contingent
the base Marion looks worse for the trip Her white
is now ripped and smudged
One of the greeting Nazis a TALL CAPTAIN salutes
and Belloq As he speaks to them we notice that right
this group just above a great deal of sub unloading
Indys whip hangs from the periscope Working Nazis
within feet of it unaware the Tall Captain would see
a moment if he were not so focused on the new arrivals
TALL CAPTAIN

instructions sir

hold on the whip for a long moment until its owners

INT TRAIN TUNNEL

The Ark and its entourage are moving slowly up the
dark tunnel their way lit by intermittent lanterns
tunnel is irregular but generally about 7 feet wide
height varies from an average of about 7 feet to a low

only about 45 feet at the points (every 40 feet) where
support beams cross the track The result is that there

only about a foot of clearance above the mine cars at
points passengers must duck to keep from being hit in
head Shliemann looking worried and Belloqg very

are focused on the Ark in the car ahead

Uniformed Nazi Soldiers are everywhere wrangling

rock

Across the open court Belloq sees his destination a
brilliant white silk tent has been erected in the midst
all this hardware It looks incongruous and more than
little eerie It is the Tabernacle

the protection of a high stack of supplies He climbs
back of the stack peeks over and surveys the area

In addition to the Tabernacle the second train tunnel
entrance and all the activity Indys glance rests
momentarily on a large heavy metal door halfway down
wall toward the Tabernacle It bears the words in

Nazis wait impatiently eyeing the Ark with some

looks From one knot of men there is muttering about
and such but when Bellog turns a fiery gaze on them

is immediate silence Shliemann looks uncertain in this
presence

Bellogq approaches the Ark He stops a few feet from it
begins murmuring an invocation in Hebrew After a few
of this he advances a step and is about to place the
rod in a notch under the lid of the Ark itself The end
the rod is an inch from the notch when -
Indy steps into the Tabernacle On his shoulder is a
and it is aimed directly at the Ark
INDY

current and for a moment his complete form is white
blue then maybe green but it is hard to tell because

eyes are blinded now too Two aspects of this ghastly
beautiful display are somehow communicated in the

although the communication is subliminal First that
in the instant of his destruction has experienced some
of sublime transcendental knowledge If a deaths-head
smile and look satisfied that is how Belloqs

face would be described Secondly this event is

so haunting that the suggestible among us might imagine

doubles its speed and shoots under the low cross beam
same instant as -

A huge dragon of all-consuming fire shoots up the

and his men The tunnel collapses in this section

the fried Nazis forever

INT TRAIN TUNNEL

Indy and Marion look back at the low cross beam as the
tongue of flame makes it there and then is doused by

rock and dirt They look at each other then turn their
attention back to their own predicament Their mine car

Indy is already pulling the throttle It moves easily
Unfortunately it is no longer attached to the motor

mine car is out of control After several moments far
appears a circle of bright daylight - the end of the

It approaches at a frightening rate Indy reaches out
grasps Marions hand They exchange looks and then turn
look ahead

THEIR POV

Were taking this last stretch with them Its a

nightmare It has to do with a rollercoaster that ends
suddenly and disastrously The shocking brightness of

rushes up to engulf us blinding us in its glare

EXT THE ISLAND - END OF TRACKS DOCK

High up on the slope of the island Indy and Marions
car shoots out of the black tunnel and roars down
little dock at the end of the tracks

A small Nazi transport launch carefully disguised as a
fishing boat sits bobbing by the dock The only human
Nazi Sentry dressed as a Greek peasant He is perched
pile of seed bags which are stacked at the very end of
train tracks As the mine car barrels noisily down

him he throws away some burlap to reveal a mounted
gun which he spins quickly around toward the

mine car He opens fire

In the out-of-control mine car Indy pulls Marion down

him They are squashed into the corner trying to avoid

into a tighter and tighter embrace of life

At the machine gun post the Nazi Sentry has been

like crazy but now there is terror in his eyes He

the car is not going to stop He lacks faith in his
stronghold Too late

The mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker And
through The Nazi Sentry his machine gun and a dozen
seed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild

mass The mine car jumps bounces and spins around

slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the

INT COMMAND CENTER

Fire Everywhere No sign of life A large gaping
flames ringing it blazing into the room beyond
one hinge there its metal blasted and jagged is a

door with the signed lettering in German DANGER -
MUNITIONS

The first explosion happens Its a baby compared to
coming yet it rocks the earth Its terrible And then
immediately another The long irregular ever larger
of explosions begins

caves dirt and rock shoot out like spraying water

away into the turbulent sea Birds scream and soar
to land

Finally we settle on a full shot of the island We can
recognize that the small opening high on the slope from

a cloud of smoke and dust is billowing is the end of

mine tunnel And there below it quite small from this
distance is the dock And the boat that looks like a

fishing boat There can be no mistake even from this
away - the boat is chugging out to sea

INT THE PENTAGON - DAY

Indy Brody and Marion looking very stylish are
Colonel Musgroves huge office Sun pours in a window
which Washington can be seen sparkling across the
Everything is neat and clean and regular Including the
men who are arrayed around the office Two we know -
Musgrove and Maj Eaton The third is an unnamed

He hangs back smiling and genial his features

the glare of the window He doesnt say anything yet
have a sense that the others defer to him in the matter

hand He is the essence of all that is Byzantine and
inscrutable in our scrubbed government machine

Indy and Brody are dissatisfied with the way the

gone Marion on the other hand is very happy and

get out of there Eatons manner is irritatingly
MUSGROVE

Youve done your country a great
service
EATON
And we trust you found the settlement
satisfactory

MARION
Quite

EATON
Good good
(glances around at
the others)
Then I guess that about does it

BRODY
When can we have the Ark

Eatons glance flicks over to the mysterious
Bureaucrat
then back to Brody

EATON
I thought we answered that Its
someplace very safe -

INDY
(heated)
Thats a powerful force Research
should be done -

EATON
Oh it will be Dr Jones I assure
you We have top men working on it
right now

INDY
Who

EATON
Top men

Indy exchanges a look with Brody

INDY
We may be able to help

EATON
We appreciate that And we wont
hesitate to call on you

EXT PENTAGON STEPS - DAY
Indy Brody and Marion emerge from the building Brody
them farewell and moves off in another direction

scolding him
MARION
Well they arent going to tell you
so why dont you just forget it Id
think youd had enough of that damn
Ark Just put your mind on something

Indy stops looking across the river his mind
INDY
Yeah like what
Marion makes a face then puts her arms around his neck
plants a humdinger of a kiss on his mouth It goes on a
Finally they break
INDY
Its not the Ark but itll have
to do
They move down the steps smiling
INT GOVERNMENT WAREHOUSE
The Ark of the Covenant sits in a wooden crate A
comes down and hides it from view The lid is solidly
to the crate as we read the stenciled message on top -
TOP SECRET

THE END CREDITS ROLL AS WE SEE -

A Little Old Government Warehouseman begins pushing the
Ark down as aisle Soon we see that the aisle is formed
huge stacks or crates They come in many shapes and

but when it comes right down to it they all look like

one that holds the Ark All have markings like the

weve just seen Pretty soon were far enough and high
away from the Little Old Government Warehouseman to see
this is one of the biggest rooms in the world And it
full Crates and crates All looking alike All

dust

And then we notice that the Little Old Government
Warehouseman pushing his new crate ahead of him has

into another aisle and disappeared from view

FADE
