LETHAL WEAPON IT

November 1988
FADE IN

EXT A REMOTE AREA OF LAX - DAY

4 United 747 barrels down the runway It lifts off
and passes overhead with a DEAFENING ROAR And thats
when

MARTIN RIGGS STEPS INTO FRAME
He looks up at the underbelly of the jet So low that
he could count the rivets Except Riggs doesnt appear
toe be in any shape to count anything
Unshaven Hair matted A grease-stained baseball cap
pulled down low to keep the sun out of his blood-shot
eyes He raises a brown paper bag to his lips Heaven
help us Riggs is back in the bottle
CUT TO

ANOTHER PART OF THE REMOTE AREA
where a MERCEDES LIMO pulls up to a GULFSTREAM JET
The Gulfstreams engines are REVVING in preparation
of take off

CUT TO
MARTIN RIGGS

staggering drunkenly through the weeds and tall grass
that fringe this remote section of the airport

RIGGS
(singing softly)
Jingle bell jingle bell jingle
bell rock

Behind him a Delta 727 touches down Wheels SLAMMING
against the runway brakes SQUEALING jet engines
SCREAMING in reverse thrust

CUT TO
THE MERCEDES AND THE GULFSTREAM

FOUR MEN emerge from the Mercedes South Africans
BANS PETER KARL and ROLF

Karl pops open the trunk and SEVERAL SUITCASES are quickly

unloaded and placed on the tarmac beside the Mercedes
Peters eyes dart furtively behind his black-out shades
Karl SHUTS the Mercedes trunk lid Hans picks up two
ef the suitcases and takes a step toward the Gulfstream
-- then stops abruptly

Why Because a drunk is weaving towards them

Riggs rolls his eyes Takes another hit from the bottle
in the brown paper sack Licks his lips Stumbles
Regains his balance Advances toward the men

‘The South Africans exchange a look then Hans moves
forward to intercept Riggs

RANS
Hey buddy Where you going

RIGGS
(speech slurred)
Anybody seen a dog lLookin for
my dog Ran off and got lost
Maybe you seen him A brown dog
Four legs one tail Face
like this -

Riggs contorts his face into a weird expression

HANS
Come on pal No dog around here

Hans clamps his hand down firmly on Riggs shoulder
Riggs sways from side to side and gives Hans a blearyeyed
look

RIGGS
I just gotta find that dog Know
what I mean Hes a good dog

Hans spins Riggs around points him in the opposite
direction and gives him a shove

HANS
Go sleep it off somewhere
Riggs takes several wobbly steps then stops -- bends
at the waist -- appears to PUKE his guts out Hans

grimaces And thats when
A FORD BRONCO ROARS INTO THE SCENE
Brakes SQUEALING as it skids up to the Gulfstream

The South Africans turn to look -- knowing instantly
that something has gone very wrong for them
HANS
The suitcases Grab the suitcases

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON RIGGS BACK

as Riggs straightens up and spins around eyes

clear and alive wider than hell -- nostrils flaring

-- arm extended gripping a silver NINE MILLIMETER BERETTA
that flashes in the midday sun This is one very dangerous
and very sober cop we have here

RIGGS
(screaming)
POLICE FREEZE HANDS ON THE CAR
LEGS SPREAD APART NOW

AN UNMARKED POLICE SEDAN

SKIDS up from another direction ROGER MURTAUGH leaps
out with his pistol drawn Riggs regards Murtaugh with
an expression that is hardly welcoming

RIGGS
Youre late I had to do my lost dog
routine and my puke routine

MURTAUGH
You didnt give me the signal

RIGGS
I gave you the signal -- Jingle bell rock

MURTAUGH
The signal was Jingle bell roll

Riggs sticks a hand under his shirt with a disgusted
expression and YANKS out the WIRE hes been wearing

THREE COPS

have jumped from the Ford Bronco with service revolvers
drawn They wear jeans and distinctive satin jackets
that have LAPD DRUG ENFORCEMENT lettered on the
back Well see these guys again Their names are
TIM CAVANAUGH GARY PRICE and TOM WYLER

They rush toward the flummoxed South Africans
but heres something they didnt count on

THE GULFSTREAM PILOT
appears in the cabin doorway brandishing an UZI SUBMACHINE

GUN A rapid BURST OF FIRE scatters the Drug Cops
They dive behind the Bronco for cover
MURTAUGH
Oh shit

Now things happen fast --

Riggs ROLLS beneath the Gulfstream behind the landing
gear

Murtaugh DROPS down behind his Sedan FIRING off several
ROUNDS

Hans grabs a suitcase RUNS up the boarding steps and
disappears into the Gulfstream

The other South Africans produce weapons from beneath
their coats and BLAST their way back into the Mercedes

The Drug Cops are pinned down by UZI GUNFIRE Murtaugh
tries to nail the Pilot -- but only succeeds in drawing

his fire The Pilot SPRAYS THE UZI in Murtaughs direction
Murtaugh ducks behind his Sedan as bullets RIP THROUGH

the cars HOOD and GRILL

RIGGS

crouches low under the Gulfstreams fuselage working
his way toward the front The REVVING ENGINES are HOT
and NOISEY

Now Riggs is directly beneath the boarding staircase
The spent shell casings from the Uzi Submachine gun
(CHATTERING directly OVERHEAD) dance on the tarmac all
around him

Riggs grabs hold of the staircase and makes his move
» « « fast and with the agility of a cat he SWINGS
out from beneath the airplane -- pulling himself upward
face to face with the startled Pilot -- BERRETA OUT
- fire EXPLODING from its muzzel at point blank range

The Pilot is blasted backwards into the Gulfstream
-- the Uzi SPRAYING BULLETS through the roof of the
fuselage as he falls

INT COCKPIT OF GULFSTREAM

Hans panics He doesnt know how to fly a plane but

he wants to get the hell away so he PUSHES FORWARD
on the THROTTLE just enough to put the plane INTO MOTION
OUTSIDE THE GULFSTREAM

Riggs is on the staircase when the plane begins to TAXI

FORWARD The staircase TEARS AWAY from the Gulfstreams
fuselage SPILLING Riggs to the ground
Riggs TUMBLES beneath the wing where -- flat on his
back -- he sees the LANDING GEAR ROLLING TOWARDS KEIM

RIGGS
Oooohhhhhh --

He rolls out of harms way -- the landing gear coming
within inches of crushing him But now Riggs must
contend with the SEARING HEAT expelled from the Turbofan
Jet Engine as it passes over him

THE LEADING EDGE OF THE GULFSTREAMS WING

SHEERS off the roof of the Ford Bronco as it passes
by Meanwhile

THE MERCEDES

SQUEALS away in cloud of exhaust smoke But in their
hurry to escape with their lives the South Africans
have forgotten about the TWO SUITCASES resting on the
tarmac The Mercedes PLOWS into them sending them
flying One of them OPENS and BUNDLES of US
CURRENCY spill out

RIGGS
gets to his feet Murtuagh rushes up to him

The Glufstream is rolling off in one direction and
the Mercedes has driven off in the other

RIGGS
(pointing at Gulfstream)
That one is mine You take the Benz

Riggs doesnt even wait for Murtaughs reply He just
RUNS OFF after the Gulfstream

Murtaugh and the Drug Cops jump into the DECAPITATED
BRONCO and speed away

THE MERCEDES LIMO

races across the perimeter of the landing field The
Bronco chasing after it

RIGGS
chases the moving Gulfstream on foot -- running like
a gazelle He catches up to it -- LEAPS onto the wing

from behind and holds on tight He works his way over
the wing toward the OPENING IN THE FUSELAGE where the
door used to be
THE BRONCO

overtakes the Mercedes Now theyre side-by-side
GUNFIRE is exchanged out the windows of the two vehicles

The Mercedes attempts some wild evasive turns but the
Bronco sticks to it like glue -

RIGGS

is on the wing of the Gulfstream He tries to SWING
INTO THE DCORWAY His foot SLIPS He almost falls
beneath the moving plane He holds on tight with both
hands but LOOSES HIS BERETTA -- it slips from
his belt azd BOUNCES on the ground

Riggs PULLS himself up into the airplane
INT COCKFIT OF GULSTREAM

Close quaters Very cramped Hans swirls to face Riggs
FIRES his cun Misses Riggs YANKS him out of the
cockpit ‘The fight is on

EXT RUNKZiY AND INFIELD

The Mercedes cuts diagonally across the runway headed
toward the TERMINAL AREA The Bronco right on its tail

They reach the AIRPORT APRON This is where the planes
dock and tzere is considerable GROUND SERVICE traffic
in the area Such as

A BAGGAGE TRAIN that crosses the Mercedes path No
time to avcid it -- CRASH -- the Mercedes RAMS it
SPLITS it apart Travels directly through it Luggage
scattered everywhere

The Bronco follows -- destroying the luggage even further
-- draggins articles of clothing from its bumper

Suddenly

A BOEING 727 that is being BACKED AWAY from the gate

looms up iz front of the Mercedes The Mercedes BRAKES

-- SKIDS iz a pool of oil -- SLEWS sideways out of control
towards a FUEL TRUCK

Ground Service CREW MEMBERS see it all unfolding and
leap for sefety

INT THE MERCEDES

Peter and Rolf are frozen with fear But KARL in the
back seat KICKS OPEN the door and BAILS OUT
EXT THE MERCEDES

It SMASHES into the Fuel Truck EXPLOSION FIRE BALL
The Bronco swerves to avoid the inferno

Karl rolls across the pavement gets to his feet and
RUNS

cur To
THE GULFSTREAM

rolling -- with no one in control -- toward an ANCHOR
FENCE at the airports perimeter

INSIDE THE GULSTREAM

Riggs and Hans beat the shit out of each other Hans
knows as much about Martial Arts as Riggs does Both
men are being brutally punished

cur TO
INT BAGGAGE DEPOT

Karl runs in shouldering his way past several BAGGAGE
HANDLERS who try to stop him and HOPS ONTO THE CONVEYOR
BELT that carries the luggage into the terminal Shoving
suitcases and parcels aside he runs up the belt

Moments later MURTAUGH ARRIVES

MURTAUGH
Police officer Police officer

He flashes his badge without ever breaking stride
And when he sees the conveyor belt he knows this is
where Karl has gone He leaps onto the belt as well

INT TERMINAL BUILDING BAGGAGE CLAIM

Karl SLIDES down the shute onto the BAGGAGE CAROUSEL
upending himself and several pieces of luggage in the
process Startled PASSENGERS react to the sight

Karl heads for the Exit Door But an AIRPORT SECURITY
VEHICLE PULLING UP TO THE CURB outside causes him to
change direction

MURTAUGH

SLIDES down the shute onto the Carousel KICKING pieces

ef baggage from his path vaulting to the floor Passengers
have already become blase at the sight -- they hardly

even lock
Murtaugh spots Karl running ahead and chases him down
Aes e

TERMINAL CORRIDOR

Fatigue begins to set in for Murtaugh He runs on rubber
legs PANTING and PUFFING

Up ahead are several REVOLVING DOORS Passengers from
arriving flights are using these doors to enter the
Baggage Claim area

Karl waits for the doors to clear of people then slips

in But guess what These doors only turn in one direction

When pushed the wrong way they LOCK and an ALARM SOUNDS
And thats what happens to Karl

Hes trapped tuck inside the revolving door He
cant believe it

Murtaugh rushes towards him

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON KARL

Does he throw up his hands and surrender Not on your
life He PANICS -- he raises his gun and POINTS IT
AT MURTAUGEH

MURTAUGH

swings up his own gun At the same moment --

THE THREE DRUG COPS

arrive from the opposite direction All WEAPONS EXPLODE
Bystanders SCREAM and duck for cover

The revolving door is SHATTERED and Karls bullet riddled
body PIROUTTES through the broken glass

MURTAUGH AND THE DRUG COPS

exchange an exhausted look as they holster their hand
guns

cur TO
EXT KNOLL ABOVE PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY
At the top of the knoll is the ANCHOR FENCE that surrounds
the Airport The knoll slopes gently downward do the
BUSY HIGHWAY below

We watch as --
THE GULFSTREAM TEARS THROUGH THE ANCHOR FENCE and SLIDES
DOWN the embankment toward the Highway

INT THE GULFSTREAM

Riggs and Hans are THROWN FORWARD as the plane drops
-- TUMBLING head over heels down the center aisle

EXT PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY

The Gulfstream trails a giant CLOUD OF DUST as it rolls
across the highway BRAKES SQUEAL HORNS HONK Traffic
screeches to a halt A CHAIN-REACTION of REAR-END COLLISIONS
results CRASH CRASH CRASH

The Gulfstream continues across the highway toward a
BLUFF that overlooks the BEACH and the OCEAN BELOW
A sheer drop that would mean certain death for Riggs
and Hans inside the plane

INT THE GULFSTREAM

Riggs glances through the windshield -- sees the bluff
approaching The hell with Hans hes got to stop
the plane And thats just what he does -- PULLING
BACK HARD ON THE BRAKE LEVERS

But during this HANS LEAPS OUT OF THE PLANE onto
the highway below

EXT THE HIGHWAY

The Gulfstream SKIDS TO A STOP with its NOSE WHEEL DANGLING
over the cliff PHEWH

HANS

runs along the highway Traffic has come to a complete
stop for miles People climb from their cars to gawk

at the spectacle So it isnt very hard for Hans to
STEAL one of these cars make a UTURN and escape

EXT THE GULFSTREAM

Riggs appears in the doorway holding Hans SUITCASE

A CROWD OF SPECTATORS pushes forward to get a look at
him

The Ford Bronco ROARS up followed by TWO HIGHWAY PATROL
CARS SIRENS are SCREAMING BUBBLE LIGHTS are FLASHING

Sensing Murtaughs authority the crowd parts clearing
a path for him Riggs hops down from the Gulfstream
Soe

Murtaugh marches up to him Riggs looks pretty beaten
up and very pissed off

MURTAUGH
What happened

RIGGS
What happened I stopped the plane
thats what happened

MURTAUGH
Wheres your guy

RIGGS
What about your guys How many collars
did you make

MURTAUGH
No collars Three bodies But at
least they didnt get away

RIGGS
Get off my back I captured a plane
and a suitcase full of money and

its still before lunch

MURTAUGH
(after a pause)
Speaking of lunch isnt there a
hot dog stand a few miles down the
beach from here

CAMERA PULLS UP and AWAY as Riggs and Murtaugh push
their way through the crowd

Someones CAR RADIO is PLAYING LOUDLY

RADIO
« « « and KNXT Newsradio traffic
tipster informs us that theres a
a stalled jet plane tying up traffic
on the Pacific Coast Highway in
the LAX area Thats right
a stalled jet plane So if youre
headed in that direction look for
an alternate route or expect to be
stuck in traffic for most of the day

DISSOLVE TO

A PRIVATE ELEVATOR

Hans rides up in the elevator His arm is in a sling
His face bruised and swollen

¢
il

INT ELEGANT OFFICE - DAY

The private elevator opens directly into the office
which is tastefully and expensively appoizted with
antiques and oriental rugs

Hans enters the office which at first glance seems
empty Then we notice him Seated not at iis desk
but at a small table where he is eating his lunch
His name is ARJEN RUDD

RUDD
Hans Come in Sit down over here

Rudd indicates the chair across the table from him
As Hans comes forward he realizes that he s WALKING
ON A SHEET OF PLASTIC that has been laid over the carpet

RUDD
Dont mind the plastic Im having
some painting done
(beat)
Sit down

Hans sits Rudd is enjoying a thick steak for lunch
He slices off a piece and slides it into hiz mouth
Hans sits nervously waiting for Rudd to spzak

RUDD
So tell me Hans what went wring
The police were waiting We lost a
considerable amount of money ne to
mention the airplane

HANS
I dont know Mr Rudd I workez
out every detail myself I left
nothing to chance

RUDD
I see
(beat )
Just bad luck huh

Rudd calmly cuts another piece of steak ané oops it
into his mouth

HANS
I think it was inevitable Takicg
the money out in small shipments is
much too slow and much too dangersus
We should do it all at one time in
one enormous shipment

Rudd doesnt reply to this suggestion In fact he
changes the subject completely
2

RUDD
Hows the arm You all right
(smiling)
Live to fight another day

Hans relaxes Reassured by Rudds expression of concern

HANS
Yes sir Im fine Thank you

RUDD
Sometimes things simply do not turn
eut as we plan them
(smiles)
This steak for example Cajun style
Look its all black Do you like it
that way Hans

HANS
Well I dont know

RUDD
Here I want you to taste this
and tell me what you think

Rudd slices off a piece of steak for Hans spears it
with his fork and offers it to him

As Hans leans forward to take the piece of meat in his
mouth we HEAR PHHHITT And Hans is propelled BACKWARDS
in his chair A BULLET through his FOREHEAD

MR BENEDICT

appears having entered from the bathroom holding a
SILENCED PISTOL in his hand Hes a wiry loosejointed
weasle with madness in his eyes and a perpetual smirk
playing upon his lips

He looks down at Hans body Blood is pumping from
his head wound onto the plastic sheet

BENEDICT
You give new meaning to the word
dropcloth Mr Rudd

Benedict removes the ROLEX WATCH from Hans wrist before
wrapping up the body in the plastic

RUDD
Certain policemen in this city have
become an intolerable nusiance
BENEDICT
I was saying the same thing just the
other day Maybe you heard my speech
before the Junior League

Rudd is familiar with Benedicts peculiar sense of humor
He proceeds without reaction

RUDD
Is your team assembled

BENEDICT
Ready and waiting
(meaning the
Rolex )
Say can I keep this

Rudd voices no objections as Benedict slips the watch
onto his wrist

RUDD
Hans was an incompetent piece of
shit but he had one good idea
in his life and he just gave it
to me One big shipment Thats
exactly what were going to do
Move it all out at once

BENEDICT
Youre going to need something bigger
than a suitcase for that

RUDD
That can be arranged
(beat)
Now about these cops how do
we handle them

BENEDICT
Ready to declare war

RUDD
Not if we dont have to

BENEDICT
Then lets fire a warning shot across
their bow Hope they get the message
Rudd removes a PHOTOGRAPH from a folder

RUDD
Have a look

Benedict takes the photo its a PICTURE OF MURTAUGH
(34
BENEDICT
Whos this

RUDD
Hes the cop in charge

Benedict practically licks his lips

BENEDICT
Oh this is going to be lovely

Sandwich would be fine

INT THE KITCHEN

Riggs leans against the kitchen counter standing up
eating a sandwich as Trish unloads the dishwasher

Riggs watches her as if mesmerized by this simple domestic
chore Perhaps she feels his gaze because she turns

to look at him

TRISH
Youre welcome to sit at the table

RIGGS
I like to eat standing up
(hands her his
empty plate)
Thanks

Trish takes the plate -- looks into Riggs eyes -- sees
his troubled look
onadt

(very syQpathetically)
Something wre

Riggs doesnt anewer fight away

RIGGS
Four years ago this week thats
when Vicki died cant get it
out of my mind

TRISH
Is it something you want to talk

Riggs lights up a cigarette shakes out the match takes
a pull on it expells the smoke Trish takes this as
a no Ww

TRISH
You dont have to

But Riggs wants to He goes right into it

RIGGS

The phone was ringing when I walked
in the door Mustve been ten
or eleven at night I answered the
phone and got the news She was
dead Killed in a car crash And
then I remember going down on my
knees shaking all over and thinking
Here I go Im losing it So
now Im lying on the floor of the
living room seeing under the
couch and theres my Cross
pen I was looking all over for
And then I heard a voice like
a drill instructor saying
Get up -- now But I stay down
And the voice keeps telling me to
get up And then I did something
weird I decided to stop crying just
to see if I could And I could
And then I stretched my mouth
into a smile I waghurting but
my muscles still wandked and I

stood up After Mat I drove to
the morgue Idgntified the body And

signed the pa s with my Cross pen

Trish is moved by the story But Riggs himself is unfazeé
« almost detached from it

RIGGS
I can talk about it It doesnt hurt
to talk about it

TRISH
Then what does Because you sure as
hell have some other demon inside of
you

RIGGS
(after a moment his
expression now filled
with emotion)
I was cheating on her Trish The
night she died I was with somebody
else

Trish doesnt know what to say but now she becomes
aware of Murtaugh standing in the kitchen doorway
Riggs turns and sees him too

MURTAUGH

bottle
Riggs nods his head

Murtaugh looks through the peephole to be certain its
Room Service then opens the door The Waiter rolls
in the cart and parks it in front of the window He
reacts to the sight of Murtaugh and Riggs but nobody
notices except us

Riggs lifts the silver dome We expect him to find
Ham and Eggs and A Gun but he doesnt There is an
order of Hamburger and Fries instead

RIGGS
Come get your hamburger Leo

Now the Waiter reaches down into the LOWER COMPARTMENT
where he has moved the plate containing the gun

LEO
Hey I didnt order a hamburger

This causes Riggs to turn back in the Waiters direction
just in time to see THE GUN COMING UP FROM BEHIND

Riggs and Leo throw themselves at the Waiter They
BUMP HEADS LOUDLY in the process but Riggs is able

to grab the Waiters hand and the gun DISCHARGES into

to pull him back Hed have more luck if Leo wasnt
CLINGING to Riggs neck

RIGGS
Let go

All three FALL BACK UNDER THE WATER Sunbathers look
on with horrified expressions frozen in place incapable
of lending assistance

Then Riggs POPS UP again Hes got a grip on the Waiter
who now has the window curtain WRAPPED AROUND HIS HEAD

Riggs PUNCHES him HARD in the face several times until
a BLOOD STAIN appears on the curtain Riggs feels the
Waiter go limp in his arms Fe unwraps the curtain
and discovers that HES BEEN BEATING UP LEO

Leos nose is bleeding and he wears a dazed expression

RIGGS

Turning he sees the Waiter escaping on the opposite

EXT NARROW CANYON ROAD - DAY

Its so lush and overgrown with bushes and trees that
its hard to believe were only ten minutes away from
Beverly Hills

A TOW TRUCK blocks most of the narrow road while the
OPERATOR connects the towing bar to the undercarriage
of a stalled HONDA

Murtaughs Folice Sedan can be seen approaching

Yeah yeah I reyenber the fountain

The house itself cannot ke seen from the road - hedges
and trees block the view But there is a marble fountain
visible and this is what Leo recognizes

Murtaugh pulls up BEHIND the Tow Truck Riggs jumps
out - Leo tries to follow him

RIGGS
(to Leo)
Stay here

EXT THE ROAD

The Tow Truck is blocking the driveway Riggs and Murtaugh
walk around it

MURTAUGH

his breath)
Helpful citizen

The Partners walk up the driveway where a MERCEDES 450SL
is parked

EXT FRONT YARD OF HOUSE
The house comes into view An ultra-modern glass palace
MURTAUGH
Keep your shooter under wraps
Dont wanna give some innocent
taxpayer a coronary
RIGGS
Nobody who lives in a house like
this can be completely innocent

They carefully circle the house until a COMMANDING VIEW

OF LOS ANGELES -- from the Wilshire District to Marina
Del Rey -- presents itself

and
A REVERSE ANGLE Ny

reveals the house to be HOPPED UP ON STILTS Most
of the house and the gntire back deck precariously overhang
the canyon

RIGGS AND MURTAUGH
walk across the deck

RIGGS
Nice view huh

They pass a large SLIDING GLASS DOOR They see a MAN
inside the house lifting weights

MURTAUGH
Whatve we got here

RIGGS
The body beautiful

INT THE HOUSE

The man is tall well built and blonde -- like the Hitmen
from the opening scene He lifts a HEAVY BARBELL over
his head as he faces a MIRRORED WALL

His back is to the sliding glass door but he can see
Riggs and Murtaugh in the mine

Suddenly he SPINS an® HURLS THE BARBELL TEROUGH
THE PLATE GLASS WINDOW 4

EXT THE DECK

The window EXPLODES The barbell sails through the
air SLAMMING into Riggs and Murtaugh Knocking them
backwards

Riggs gun is drawn even before he crashes down onto
the deck And its a good thing because the weightlifting
Hitman has grabbed up an UZI

Riggs gets off several rapid SHOTS The Hitmans UZI
SPRAYS WILDLY Potted plants on the deck rail explode
and shatter into small bits

Murtaugh and Riggs PUMP LEAD right back at him until
the Hitman FLEES out the back door

EXT DRIVEWAY

The Hitman runs from the house Hes about to leap
into the 450SL parked there when he realizes that the
Tow Truck is BLOCKING the driveway

His only choice Absolutely He runs down the driveway
and JUMPS INTO THE TOW TRUCK The Tow Truck Cperater
has just finished hooking up the disabled Honda when

he hears his Trucks MOTOR ROAR TO LIFE
OPERATOR
Hey

Riggs and Murtaugh arrive just as the Truck SQUEALS
AWAY pulling the Honda behind it Riggs LEAPS
onto the back of the Tow Truck

(yelling to Riggs)
Dont kill him

Murtuagh makes a dash for his own vehicle
INT POLICE SEDAN

Murtaugh jumps in behind the wheel and FIRES UP the
motor Leo begins to climb over from the back seat

MURTAUGH
Whatre you doing

LEO
See better up here

Murtuagh shoves Leo backwards ine the rear seat

gt
SPEEDS down the narrow ganyon road Riggs is working
his way up toward the Trucks Cab holding onto the
TOWING BOOM for support -- taking care not to be seen
in the rearview mirror

THE TOW TRUCK

The Truck is taking the curves at dangerous speeds causing
the Honda its towing to FISHTAIL in alldirections

THE POLICE SEDAN

ROARS up behind the speeding Tow Truck Murtaugh can
see what Riggs is up to

CLOSE ON RIGGS

as he TAPS the barrel of his pistol against the cabs
rear window to get the Hitmans attention The Hitman
glances over his shoulder Riggs smiles as if to say
Surprise asshole”

But instead of slowing down the Hitman ACCELERATES
and the Truck surges forward Riggs looks dismayed

co
THE HITMAN
reaches down with his left hand -- pulls a smal AUTOMATIC
PISTOL from an ankle holster -- and FIRES it over his

right shoulder THROUGH THE CABS REAR WINDOW

RIGGS

pulls away as the window EXPLODES in his face and the
bullet GRAZES his cheek FOUR MORE SHOTS follow through
the back of the Cabs wall Riggs LEAPS onto the TRUCKS
ROOF to escape the volley

INT THE POLICE SEDAN

Murtaugh stays close on the Trucks tail and is
startled to see that Riggs is now clinging to the roof

INT CAB OF TOW TRUCK

The Hitman hears Riggs on the roof and SLAMS DOWN
HARD ON THE BRAKES SQUEALING and SKIDDING

RIGGS

is propelled forward - BCUNCES n the hood then ROLLS
off the front of the Truck 4 ctly into its PATH

Well this would seem te Qe the end of Riggs because
he would certainly be srushed beneath the Truck But
of course we know it isnt

A REVERSE ANGLE ON THE TRUCK

finds Riggs CLINGING to a small triangular PLATFORM
protruding from the Trucks front bumper (This platform
holds a WINCH and CABLE RIG used to pull cars cut of

mud or soft sand)

Riggs straddles the Winch his legs out in front of
him the HEELS of shoes SCRAPING on the pavement as
it speeds beneath him

THE HITMAN

checks his side mirrors -- sees that Murtaugh is still
behind him

FULL SHOT - WINDING CANYON ROAD

The Tow Truck THUNDERS around the hairpin turns crossing
the center line -- the Honda its towing WHIPS back

and forth Murtaughs Sedan matches the Tow Trucks
every move
RIGGS POV

Imagine being strapped to the bumper of a speeding vehicle
- that’s the perspective Riggs has on the world right
now and it isnt very comforting

The pavement is whizzing by only inches below him
Hes totally unprotected -- a headon collision would
smash him like a bug

And this is exactly the thought that cccurs to Riggs
as the Truck crosses the center line directly into the
path of an ONCOMING STATION WAGON

Riggs Shuts his eyes -- and the twe vehicles SWERVE
APART at the last possible second to avcid a direct
hit But the Station Wagon SCRAPES against the Tow
Trucks side sending a SHOWER OF SPARKS into the air
Riggs exhales an enormous breath of relief

INT POLICE SEDAN
Murtaugh also reacts to the near-miss as the Station
Wagon Speeds by with HORN BLARING Leo takes this moment
to FASTEN his seat belt 9

Speeding FAST and LOW down Mulholland - BLOWING past

inches of daylight to spare

decides to pass it He STOMPS down on the gas pedal
kicking the Trucks speed up to 80 At the same moment

RIGGS

FIRES his gun into the Trucks engine compartment hoping
to hit something vital that will bring this mad chase
to a halt And guess what It works

THE HITMAN

is stunned to feel the Truck loosing power The speedometer
needle begins to drep rapidly 70 mph 50 mph

See if you can spot Riggs mistake One of the worst
times to lose power is when youre recklessly passing
a big truck on a winding road

ge

THE TOW TRUCK Q

is side-by-side with the QHing Van It doesnt have
enough power to get araqund it -- and it cant get back
into its own lane because the Moving Van is already
there

And to make matters worse a LAND ROVER with a SURF
BOARD ATTACHED TO THE ROOF is speeding towards it from
the opposite direction

RIGGS

sees this horror-show unfolding from a front row seat
The Moving Van looms up beside him like a sheet-metal
canyon wall Its big tires spitting gravel and dust
into his face Its noisy Diesel engine belching smoke
and heat

And the Land Rover headed directly for him

THE HITMAN

has only cne option He SLAMS his foot down on the
BRAKE so hard he practically sends it through the floorboard
The resulting action happens fast

THE TOW TRUCK WHEELS

LOCK -- SCREAMING and SQUEALING across the pavement
in a cloud of biue smoke
RIGGS
is THROWN OFF the Winch Platform into the road

reacts - hitting his own brakes But there just isnt
time

THE POLICE SEDAN

CRASHES into the Honda being towed by the Truck

is PROPELLED over the top of the Tow Truck - SHEARING

ORF everything that extends above the level of the Trucks

over his head

THE LAND ROVER
SKIDS and SMASHES into the unoccupied Honda
THE SURF BOARD

atop the Land Rover is LAUNCHED like a rocket It slices
fifteen feet through the air toward the Tow Truck

THE HITMAN

cant believe his eyes A goddamned Surf Board is hurtling
towards him like a guided missile It EXPLODES through
the windshield SHATTERING GLASS in all directions

FULL SHOT - MULHOLLAND DRIVE

The front end of Murtaughs Police Sedan has keen destroyed
Murtaugh and Leo climb out - shaken but net hurt
The Honda has been totaled by the Land Rover which

Riggs climbs te his feet Battered and bruised and
madder than hell He charges back toward the Tow Truck
with his gun out but stops short This is what he
sees

The Surf Board protrudes from the Tow Trucks windshield
on the drivers side Its not hard to imagine the
fate of the Hitman inside

Riggs enters the office from the elevator Its immaculate
There is no indication that any work is done here

No files No paperwork Nothing for Riggs to snoop
through

Maybe this is why the note pad on Rudds desk calls
so much attention to itself As Riggs moves toward
the desk he HEARS SOMEONE COMING

He quickly RIPS THE TOP PAGE FROM THE NOTE PAD then
steps back against the wall

Rudd charges into the office from the elevator without
even seeing Riggs and picks up his telephone Riggs
steps forward Hes followed by Benedict and FOUR
of his HITMEN

RIGGS
Calling the police Dont bother
Im already here

Rudd slowly hangs up the phone

RUDD

Riggs glances at the Hitmen Each one has blonder hair
and bluer eyes than the next And each one towers cver
Riggs

They stand there poised for action like Dobermans
‘ waiting for the attack command

One of the Hitmen advances on Riggs and Riggs

puts a move on him that would make your head spin

He grabs the guys arm and SLAMS him to the floor pinning
him there with his foot

The other Hitmen make a gesture to attack and Riggs
DRAWS HIS GUN stopping them in their tracks

RIGGS
Havent you guys heard about me
I got a bad reputation Sometimes
I just go nuts Like now Im

little push just a little nudge

Silence Nobody makes a move Mexican stand-off
Riggs begins to back toward the door

about the OPEN BATHROOM WINDOW

As he approaches to take a closer look the SHOWER CURTAIN
is quietly pulled back and a South African HITMAN STEPS
OUT OF THE TUB

Leo turns but all he gets to see is the SHOWER
CURTAIN being LOWERED over his head wrapped around
his neck -- and pulled tight shutting out the air

Leos being ASPHYXIATED by the Hitman He flails his
arms and kicks his feet but hes no match for the Hitmans
superior strength

Then Murtaugh sees a REFLECTSON IN THE TV SCREEN
Someone behind him He whigis around -- finds himself
face to face with the SOUTH AFRICAN HITMAN

He doesnt think -- he just reacts He THROWS A PUNCH
against the Hitmans jaw

The Hitman is propelled backwards against the wall

but BOUNCES BACK WITH A VENGEANCE He overwhelms Murtaugh
with a series of Martial Arts KICKS and JABS that fairly
WHISTLE through the air

Murtaugh is beaten back into the
HOBBY ROOM

Where he CRASHES to the floor within inches of the the
CARPENTERS TOOLS

The Hitman advances Murtaugh SWINGS UP his arm the
PNEUMATIC NAIL GUN in his grasp BAM He fires a nail
THUNK Right between the Hitmans eyes The expressicn
of surprise on his face is almost comical He sinks

to his knees and keals over onto his face
e

Murtaugh staggers to his feet head reeling Kolding
his side he sturbles back into

TEE LIVING ROOM

Only to see a SECOND HITMAN approaching from across
the room with a KNIFE in his hand It takes Murtaugh
a moment to bring him into focus

The Hitman comes forward slowly like a predatory animal
stalking wounded prey Murtaugh rocks back and forth

on his heels still unsteady from the beating he just

took He raises the Nail Gun -- points it at the approaching
Hitman and fires -- BAM

The Hitman grabs a small END TABLE by the legs and uses
its top as a shield THUNK The nail sinks into the
wood

The Hitman keeps coming Holding the table in front
of him Murtaugh AIMS LOWER -- BAM The Hitman
lowers the table -- THUNK Murtaugh AIMS HIGHER
BAM The Hitman raises the table -- THUNK

And thats the last nail Murtaugh ge to fire because
the Hitman is now right on top of Qym -- SWINGING the
table through the air -- SMASHING it against Murtaughs
skull -8

Murtaughs knees buckle but he doesnt go down The
Hitman RUSHES HIM his knife pointed toward Murtaughs
gut

They struggle We HEAR the nail gun discharge BAM
And the Hitman staggers backwards and falls a
NAIL THROUGH HIS HEART

turn out to be CORPSES And Riggs is right in the middle
cf them
All in various stages of decomposition and wrapped in
chains Rolling and shifting with the ocean current
Staring up from dead fish-eaten faces Clothes rotted
away in tatters Some little more than skeletons

Except one JILL still beautiful even in
ceath Her naked body white as marble

Riggs cant believe his eyes Horror and pain fill
his expression But now he fights back harder than
ever

ABOVE WATER - IN THE BOAT

The Two South Africans peer into the water see the
TURBULENCE below the signs of struggle

HITMAN Two
How long

HITMAN ONE
Minute ten And still kickin

UNDERWATER

Riggs thrusts against the chain vest pulling it tight
across his back -- POP - dislocates hj houlder
A silent scream of agony as the chains ip and loosen

ABOVE WATER - IN THE BOAT 2 Qe

The South Africans look over the Sport side of the boat
when Riggs EXPLODES OUT OF THE WATER on the starboard
side He leaps into the boat like a mad demon one
arm hanging limp

The South Africans turn but dont have a chance Riggs
is upon them before they know it And he kills them
both TWISTING THE NECK of one SNAPPING
the others BACKBONE over his knee
And then Riggs releases a PRIMAL SCREAM of anguish
and pain as he JAMS his SHOULDER back into its socket
by SLAMMING it against the wheel-house wall

cur TO
EXT A CANYON - NIGHT
We dont know exactly whats going on here

Riggs is wrapping a HEAVY CHAIN around something that
resembles a telephone POLE
e

o¢

MLURTAUGH IS WITH HIM The two men exchange a lock
that is GRIM and DETERMINED

RIGGS
Lets do it

Murtaugh drives away in his Police Sedan

Riggs watches him depart then climbs into the cab of
his truck He turns on the ignition and FLOORS THE
GAS PEDAL

The BACK TIRES SPIN MADLY in the soft dirt the
motor ROARING

EXT DECK OF STILT HOUSE - NIGHT

Benedict hears the ROARING TRUCK MOTOR from the canyon
below and comes cut onto the deck He peers down into
the darkness

Riggs has wrapped the chain around the CORNER STILT
that supports the house The other end of the chain
is attached to the Truck and Riggs is pulling
the house down

Benedict has only a moment to register a look of alarm
before a LOUD CRACK echoes across the qgnyon and the
deck begins to LIST and SWAY beneath Ais feet —

INT THE LIVING ROOM OF

All hell has broken loose Thg house has begun to SHIFT
The SOUNDS of timbers CRACKING”nails CREAKING as they
bend and pull free plaster BREAKING windows SHATTERING
water pipes BURSTING gas lines RUPTURING

MURTAUGH RUSHES IN from the front door

TWO SOUTH AFRICAN GUNMEN enter from the hallway EVERYONE
FIRES AT ONCE BAM BAM BAM BAM When the smoke
clears only Murtaugh is left standing

BENEDICT

sees Murtaugh inside the house He RAISFS HIS GUN and
FIRES but the shot goes wild because Benedict
has literally DROPPED FROM VIEW as

THE HOUSE SNAPS IN TWO

The half supported by stilts (the half that Benedict

is standing on) SLIDES DOWN THE CANYON The rest of

the house the portion built on sclid ground at the

top of the canyon remains behind (This is where Murtaugh
is)
e

‘

LAS

The SLIDING PORTION OF THE HOUSE plows a wide swath
through the trees and underbrush as it CRASHES down
into the canyon in a cloud of DUST and DEBRIS

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Benedict clings to a doorway with both hands as FURNITURE
FLIES past him Then he sees something out the opening
where the decks sliding glass doors used to be

The house is on a collision course with the TRUNK OF
A DEAD OAK TREE It protrudes from the ground at a

45 degree angle Benedict SCREAMS as the house RUSHES
toward the tree trunk SMASH The tree trunk RIPS
THROUGH THE HOUSE with tremendous force halting its
forward progress down the canyon

RIGGS HOPS FROM HIS TRUCK

He is triumphant The only man in the history of the
LAPD ever to have brought down a house

INT THE DESTROYED PORTION OF THE HOUSE

Riggs enters with his Beretta leveled He chokes on

the dust Its so thick he can hardly see The place
has been DEMOLISHED It doesnt even resemble a house
anymore Especially with this ENORMOUS TREE TRUNK taking
up so much room

Riggs picks his way through the debris And then he
SEES BENEDICT PINNED between the tree trunk and the
wall Only his his upper body is visible and
hes in agony Riggs approaches him cautiously

Benedict stares down at Riggs His eyes glassy but
filled with hate

BENEDICT
(barely gets the words
out)
- « « you just wont die will you

Riggs regards him with loathing Benedict struggles

to bring up his arm Hes still holding his pistol

He tries to aim it at Riggs but doesnt have the strength
to pull the trigger

The gun slips from his hand and he dies with his eyes
wide open

06

INT THE INTACT PORTION OF THE HOUSE

Leo (still taped to a chair) sits in the GAPING HOLE
where the house split apart -- his chair practically
TEETERING on the edge Hed be enjoying a PANORAMIC
VIEW of the canyon and beyond except for the fact that
his eyes have been taped shut

Murtaugh rushes to his rescue He pulls Leos chair
away from the brink of disaster then gently removes
the tape from his mouth and eyes

MURTAUGH
Hi Leo

LEO
Sgt Murtaugh God am I glad to
see you I didnt know what was
going on Sounded like somebody was
pulling the house down

MURTAUGH
Somebody was

Murtaugh indicates the gaping hole in the house Leo
turns to see it and jumps to a very logical conclusion

LEO
Sgt Riggs is alive

As if on cue Riggs STRIDES IN

RIGGS
You bet I am

MURTAUGH
What about Benedict

Riggs shakes his head no

MURTUAGH
Shoot him
RIGGS
No You might say he went out on
a limb
LEO

RIGGS

Murtaugh pulls off the tape from Leos ankles and wrists
Leo stands up Wiggles his fingers to bring back the
circulation
o7

LEO
Then you better hurry
I heard him talking to Benedict
They taped up everything but my ears
Hes leaving the country Today
And hes taking his cash with him

Riggs and Murtaugh exchange a look
RIGGS
Im in the mood to spoil that
-bastards travel plans What about

MURTAUGH

Riggs just smiles

calculator)
This container is about ten feet

tall by eight feet wide

numbers )

Jesus All I stole was a few hundred
thousand These guys are getting

Murtaugh holds a WRAPPED BUNDLE in his hand

of his conscience Murtaugh glances at the money

MURTUAGH

Gollar bills What Im holding in

Leo in back as usual

RIGGS

All Riggs and Murtaugh can see out the windshield is
a WALL OF MONEY but they know theres a pair of
cargo doors on the other side

MURTAUGH

As the cloud of money clears Riggs Murtaugh and Leo

Rudd and the Hit Men look up to see an AIRBORNE MERCEDES
emerging through a FLURRY OF CURRENCY and its

coming right at them

e

The Mercedes CRASHES DOWN onto the pier The SOUND
OF IMPACT is tremendous but a Mercedes is built like
a tank and the car remains intact

The Hit Men scramble to their feet
RIGGS AND MURTAUGH

get off a shct - both of them are BLOWN AWAY

RUDD

looks dazed as MONEY FALLS FROM THE SKY and lands all
around him Some of it is caught by the wind and sent
swirling dow the pier

Riggs marches up to him

RIGGS
Yeure finished Rudd Its all
over

Rudd stares et Riggs with a pathetically bewildered
expression Riggs turns his back on him SNATCHING
A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL out of the air

RIGGS
(smiling)
Bey Rog money from heaven

Murtaugh smiles and then his expression changes
to one of horror because Rudd has PULLED A KNIFE and
hes rushing up behind Riggs with it

MURTAUGH
Riggs -

fhe warning is too late Rudd STICKS the knife into
Riggs back right above his hip bone -- then pulls it
out again

Riggs eyes go wide as a SHOOTING PAIN like a thousand
volts of electricity courses through his body He
STAGGERS toward Murtaugh and Leo with an alarmed
uncomprehending expression on his face

in front of his face

RUDD
Diplomatic immunity

MURTAUGH

Murtaugh FIRES The bullet TEARS A HOLE through Rudds
credentials then tears a hole through Rudds head
the impact propelling him backwards

Leo craddles Riggs in his arms Murtaugh bends down
to him

RIGGS
Oh Jesus Roger it hurts like

Murtaugh and Leo exchange a worried expression as SIRENS
