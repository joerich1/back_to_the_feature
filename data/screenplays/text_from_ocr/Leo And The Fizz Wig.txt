TRUDY
Toast dear

JACK

Ill get a couple of those

TRUDY
(Calling)

Leo Youd better hurry down Your
dad and I have to leave

(To her husband)

Oh Jack before I forget I have to
attend a management meeting at the
store later this week thats taking
place the same time as Leos soccer
game and I was wondering if you might
be able to

JACK

Oh honey I wish I could but we need
to hire three more employees for the
shipping department and Ive got
interviews set up for the next ten
days
TRUDY

We havent been to one of Leos games
in three weeks Im starting to feel
a little guilty

JACK
Im sure Leo understands these things
He an exceptionally mature kid and if

he had any issues with it his therapist
would let us know

TRUDY
You really think Leos exceptional
Jack My biggest fear is that he might
grow upyou know ordinary
JACK
Ordinary Not our Leo Weve read
too many books on perfect parenting
for that to happen to us Trust me
Trudy weve raised a very special
boy
LEO THORTON AGE NINE ENTERS
LEO
Morning dad Morning mom
HE KISSES THEM AND SITS DOWN TO HAVE HIS BREAKFAST
TRUDY
Morning Leo Just put the breakfast
dishes in the sink when youre done

and dont forget your lunch I made
you salmon salad sandwiches

LEO
(disappointed)
Again
TRUDY

I know you dont like them but its
very good for your heart When you
get to be in your fifties youll
thank me We have to run now
LEO

Uh mom dad Before you go can I
talk to you about something important

JACK

Of course Leo You know were always
here for you whenever were here

LEO
Can I have a pet
TRUDY

A pet You mean like a goldfish or a
bird

LEO

No More like a vicious dog that would
growl whenever Id want him to

TRUDY

Oh my that is a very aggressive
request Leo

LEO

Well you see Im having trouble in
school

JACK

Oh no I hope its not academic We
have our hearts set on your being
gifted

LEO

That might be a little problem too but
the big problem is this kid Merwin
Pinehurtz He failed 4th grade last
year and so hes bigger than everyone
in the class He keeps threatening to
beat me up all the time

TRUDY

Be honest with us Leo Have you asked
yourself what your part is in this
LEO

My part My part is that Im the
victim Its a nightmare just walking
home from school every day I sometimes
have to go eight blocks out of my way

TRUDY
Have you told your teacher Mrs Oaker
LEO

No because if Merwin thinks I snitched
itll just make things worse Now if

I had a nice friendly vicious dog
who I could teach to walk up and back
to school with me maybe my problem
with Merwin will be solved So what
do you say

EXT SCHOOL YARD - DAY

LEO IS ON A BENCH EATING LUNCH WITH HIS BEST FRIEND
SARA JANE FLETCHER

SARA JANE

They said no

LEO

No to the dog But they were open
to an ant farm See theyre at work
all day and Im at school most of the
day and they didnt think leaving a
dog in the house all alone was fair to
the dog

SARA JANE

Dont you just hate it when parents
have a reasonable answer for everything

LEO

Actually Sara Jane Id really like

to have a pet Not just for protection
but being an only child gets to be

kind of a drag You are so lucky to
have two brothers and two sisters
SARA JANE
Oh please Do you have any idea what
a mess it is when we all need to go
to the bathroom at the same time And
the awful fights we have over what to
watch on TV Its no wonder my parents
stay locked in their room Oh oh
Dont look up Here comes Merwin
MERWIN
Well if it isnt my old pal Leo
Listen sawdust brain what do you
have for dessert
LEO
(Taking out a small baggie
with cookies)
Just a few chocolate chip cookies
MERWIN
Great because all I got is this
stinking apple so I think we should
trade because an apple is much better
for your health even if it is a little
bit wormy
(Takes Leos cookies and
tosses him the apple)
Maybe well run into each other on the
way home from schoolif youre
unlucky
HE LAUGHS AND GOES OFF
LEO
(Looking sheepishly at Sara
Jane)
I actually wanted a wormy apple

SARA JANE

You know what I think I think hes
jealous of you
LEO
For what reason Im short Im
troubled and Im not even sure I like
my first name What could he possibly
be jealous of

SARA JANE

I dont know It just seemed like the
right thing to say

LEO

Youre a wise person Sara Jane Its
good to have you as a friend

in various directions)

That way No that way Maybe that

SOUND A WHISTLING SOUND THAT BUILDS
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

LEOS EYES WIDEN AS THE SOUND GETS CLOSER HE LOOKS
UP

LEOS POV

FALLING FROM THE SKY AND COMING STRAIGHT AT HIM IS
A TWO STORY BUILDING

LEO (CONTD)
I really didnt need this today

THE BUILDING IS NOW GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER AND
THE NOISE IS GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER LEOS MOUTH
WIDENS IN HORROR

LEO (CONTD)
Ahhhhhhhh

THE BUILDING PLOPS DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF LEO IT

IS A VERY STRANGE STRUCTURE MUCH MORE CARTOON THAN
REAL THE WALLS ARE NOT EXACTLY STRAIGHT THE ROOF
NOT EXACTLY EVEN THE WINDOWS NOT EXACTLY MATCHING
AND THE COLORS NOT EXACTLY THE COLORS ANY RESPECTABLE
BUILDING WOULD WANT TO BE PAINTED IT CERTAINLY
DOESNT FIT WITH ANYTHING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

THERE IS A LARGE SIGN ABOVE THE DOOR THAT READS

TOON POUND
LEO (CONTD)
Toon Pound

THE DOOR OPENS AND OUT COMES HAPPY HANK A JOLLY
LOOKING MAN WEARING AN EXTRAVAGANT UNIFORM SIMILAR

TO WHAT A DOORMAN AT A FANCY HOTEL MIGHT WEAR HE

IS JUST A FEW INCHES TALLER THAN LEO HE IMMEDIATELY
PUTS HIS ARM AROUND LEO AND STARTS TO LEAD HIM INTO
THE BUILDING

HANK
Good after noon my dear boy Im
Happy Hank the Toon Pound Keeper and
your life is about to change forever
LEO DROPS HIS BACK PACK AS HE ENTERS
INT TOON POUND - DAY
IT IS LIKE AN ANIMAL SHELTER EXCEPT THE CAGES ARE

FILLED WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF THE WILDEST TOONS
IMAGINABLE

LEO
Wow

HANK
I knew youd say that Within these
walls my young friend are abandoned
Toons Toons no one wants anymore
Toons that didnt make it on TV or in
the movies or comic books and since
this is Adopt-A-Toon Week we are making

a special effort to find good homes
for them

LEO

You mean I can take one of these Toons
home with me

HANK
Absolutely

THEY BEGIN STROLLING PAST THE CAGES
HANK (CONTD)

Now what kind of a Toon did you have
in mind

LEO

Well actually I didnt have any in
mind

HANK
Good That makes things a lot easier

HE POINTS TO A VERY HANDSOME SUPER HERO TOON WEARING
TIGHTS AND CAPE AND LOOKING ADMIRINGLY AT HIMSELF
IN THE MIRROR

HANK (CONTD)

Now how about Captain Ego A great
crime fighter with just one flaw If
anyone flashes a mirror in front of
him he cant stop looking at himself
Sort of like the trouble Superman has
with Krypton

THEY PASS A LARGE CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM BAR WITH ARMS
LEGS AND A FACE THAT LOOKS LIKE A DOPEY VERSION OF
MR POTATO HEAD

HANK (CONTD)

Heres an even better one Freddy
Fudgical Freddy was going to be the
first Toon to host his own game show
Unfortunately under those hot TV lights
he started to melt

LEO

Uh you know Im not sure my parents
would want me to have

HANK

Your parents will love any of these
guys Theyre all toilet trained and
come with papers Say maybe youre
the kind that likes to have the pants
scared off him every minute You might
like Spi-gator Man
HE TURNS LEO TOWARDS ANOTHER CAGE WHERE A HALF
SPIDER HALF ALLIGATOR TOON LUNGES TOWARDS THEM
LEO SCREAMS
HANK (CONTD)
Isnt he something Hes half spider
half alligator Turn him loose in the
house and youll never be bothered by
flies or neighbors who want to borrow
stuff
SUDDENLY A FURRY HAND CLUTCHES LEOS SHOULDER AND
PULLS HIM TOWARDS THE CAGE HES IN WE GET OUR
FIRST GLIMPSE OF FIZZWIG A RASCALLY LOOKING DOG OR
IS HE A BEAR OR IS HE BEAVER
FIZZWIG

Psst kid Forget these losers Im

BEGINS TO CON HIM
FIZZWIG (CONTD)

and thoughtful boy who doesnt like to
see anyone unhappy
LEO

FIZZWIG PULLS OUT A VIOLIN AND BEGINS PLAYING SAD
MUSIC

FIZZWIG

FIZZWIG SHOVES A JAWBREAKER IN LEOS MOUTH
PREVENTING HIM FROM SPEAKING HANK SHOVES A CONTRACT
IN LEOS FACE

HANK

JACK ARE HAVING DINNER THERE ARE CARTONS OF OPENED
TAKE OUT FOOD LEO IS A BIT PREOCCUPIED
TRUDY
Hows your dinner Leo
LEO
Good Good
JACK
The meats a little chewy but it probably
strengthens the jaw And the mashed
potatoes arent as lumpy as usual
TRUDY
I know you must be tired of eating
takeout food Leo but when both parents
are working sometimes its necessary

LEO

I know and its okay Look theres
something I need to talk to you about

JACK

As a matter of fact Leo theres
something we need to talk to you about

TRUDY

Leo are we doing anything wrong
LEO
Wrong No Why do you ask

TRUDY
Your teacher Mrs Oaker called She
said you seem to have a problem
concentrating She feels thats why
your grades are not as good as they
should be

JACK
We were really surprised and I must
say a little disappointed to hear this
There is nothing more your mother and
I want then to tell our friends that
our son Leo is gifted

LEO
I really try my best Dad I do but
the truth is Im just an average kid
Im really not special

TRUDY
Nonsense Leo Youre very special
and thats the way you need to be
thinking

LEO

You know Im actually glad you brought
that up the thinking part

TRUDY and JACK
Yes

LEO
Because I was thinkingmaybe if I
had a special pet it might help me
become that special kid

TRUDY

think youre going to be very happy
with I dont have to walk it or bathe
it or feed it or take it to the vet

Now now Leo Lets look at the
positive side of things Here we were
two strangers from different worlds
who became friends Thats what the
book Robinson Crusoe is about Besides
being a great adventure story it paints
a terrific picture of the human
experience

LEO
If I read it will it make me sad

FIZZWIG

No because unlike whats happening to
us it has a happy ending

THE TWO THINK ABOUT IT AND THEN BOTH START TO CRY
HYSTERICALLY

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

SARA JANE IS SITTING NEXT TO LEO WHO IS LOOKING
VERY SAD

SARA JANE
Whats wrong Leo You look like you
lost your best friend which is very
strange since Im your best friend

LEO

I was just thinking about Robinson
Crusoe
SARA JANE
What about him
LEO
You wouldnt understand
SARA JANE

So what At least youll get it off
your chest

LEO SIGHS AND THEN TURNS AND SEES MERWIN STARING AT
HIM MAKING A MENACING FACE AND A SHAKING A
THREATENING FIST

LEO

I wonder Sara Jane If life is tough
when were only nine whats it going
to be like when were twelve

MRS OAKER ENTERS THE CLASSROOM
MRS OAKER

Okay everyone Take out a pencil and
some paper This morning Im going to
give you a little quiz but it isnt
necessarily going to be about things
were learning in school The school
board is curious about the quantity
and quality of knowledge youve acquired
outside the class room Now question
number one Name a book in which two
strangers from different parts of the
world became fast friends

THE CAMERA PANS THE BLANK STARES OF ALL THE STUDENTS
WHEN IT COMES TO LEO HE HAS AN AMAZED LOOK AND THEN
A SMILE AND THEN BEGINS WRITING FURIOUSLY WHILE
NOBODY ELSE IS
INT LEOS BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
LEO IS SULKING STARING BLANKLY INTO SPACE SUDDENLY
HIS DOOR BURSTS OPEN AND HIS MOTHER AND FATHER ENTER
QUITE EXCITED

JACK

LeoLeo

TRUDY
Oh Leo we are so proud of you
LEO
You are
JACK
We just got a call from your teacher
Mrs Oaker about that quiz you had in
school
LEO
Uh huh
TRUDY
You scored the highest in the class

Mrs Oaker has completely changed her
mind about you She said you may be

gifted after all Very gifted in fact

JACK

Despite the fact that my company just
announced they lost five million
dollars this is the happiest day of
my life

LEO

I need to be honest with you guys I
didnt really do it alone Almost
everything they asked me on the test
was something Fizzwig told me about
either while he was awake or asleep
If anyone deserves credit for my doing
well its him

JACK and TRUDY
Oh no
LEO
Oh yes Fizzwig taught me to expand

my horizons in order to get a better
picture of the human experience

TRUDY

Did you hear that Jack He just used
two big words in one sentence

JACK
And you learned this from Fizzwig

LEO
I did

JACK
Houston we have a problem Do we
stand by our decision to forbid Fizzwig
from ever showing his face around here
and lose the opportunity to have a
gifted child

TRUDY

Or do we let Leo have a maniac for a
pet

WE GO OUT ON THEIR PERPLEXED LOOK
EXT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

MINUTES LATER OUT OF BREATH AND EXCITED LEO IS
RUNNING TOWARDS THE EMPTY LOT

LEO

Fizzwig Fizzwig Its okay You
can stay I can keep you

(There is no one around
Leo yells skyward)
Good news Fizzwig I can keep you
(There is nothing)
Fizzwig Come back Fizzwig
MERWIN APPEARS
LEO (CONTD)

Oh oh

MERWIN

Hi Leo old pal I could be wrong
but it looks to me like your hairy
little body guard is no longer around
to guard your body

LEO
Uh gotta run
LEO TAKES OFF MERWIN WATCHES AND LAUGHS EVILLY
MERWIN
Yeah Im back in business
EXT SARA JANES FRONT PORCH - EARLY EVENING

IT IS STILL LIGHT OUTSIDE LEO AND SARA JANE ARE
TALKING

SARA JANE

I dont know Ive heard all kinds of
stories but this one about you having
a Toon for a pet well frankly Leo
you sound seriously disturbed

LEO

Ive never lied to you before Sara
Jane Why would I lie to you now
Losing him was my fault When my
parents said I couldnt keep him I
should have yelled or thrown a tantrum
like any normal kid

SARA JANE

Its that old could have should have
would have I say forget it Leo

Even if he did exist you have to accept
the fact that hes gone Fizzwig is
history

LEO

Fizzwig was brilliant in history Did
you know the United States Constitution
is the oldest written constitution
still used today

SARA JANE
Not really but Ill keep it in mind
LEO
Im going to that empty lot every day
Maybe just maybe the Toon Pound will
come back and Ill get another chance

SARA JANE

Good for you Leo After all hope is
what dreams are built on

LEO

Wow thats deep How did you come up
with that

SARA JANE

We went out for Chinese food yesterday
It was in the cookie

SOUND VARIOUS CARTOON HORN TOOTING
COMING DOWN THE STREET WITH A HALF DOZEN SIDE HORNS
ALL TOOTING DIFFERENT SOUNDS IS FIZZWIG DRIVING
THE HOTTEST TOON CONVERTIBLE EVER HE PULLS UP TO
SARA JANES PORCH
FIZZWIG
Anyone care to go for a spin
LEO
Fizzwig
SARA JANE
Oh my Leo You arent delusional
LEO AND SARA RUN DOWN TO HIM
LEO
You didnt go back to the pound

FIZZWIG

It didnt make sense
(MORE)
FIZZWIG (CONTD)
I knew it would be just a matter of
time before your parents came to their
senses and realized what a mistake
they made Its what happened to the
Eiffel Tower in Paris When it was
first built everyone though it was the
worst thing they ever saw Now everyone
loves it I seem to have that same
effect
(He whips out a bouquet of
flowers and hands them to
Sara Jane)
These are for you Okay Leo Get

dont want to be late for dinner By
the way Im cooking
LEO
