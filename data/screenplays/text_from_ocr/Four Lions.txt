MAHMOOD
Yeah

OMAR
Right so Simba and Pumba were out
on their own when all of a sudden
they saw this big evil bird that
Scar had sent out to look for
them and Simba goes ‘look there
it is’ — the big evil vulture
coming right at them
(pauses — lost in thought)

MAHMOOD
And then what dad

OMAR

Well Simba had to bring it down
or otherwise it would kill them —
so he grabbed a stone and chucked
it at the bird only he chucked it
so hard it was such a strong
powerful throw that his arm went
all the way round and the stone
went right behind him — he threw
it so hard it went a mile behind
him — and it — hit Mufasa — wise
strong Mufasa Simba’s dad — it
hit him accidentally on the head
and killed him

MAHMOOD
But didn’t Scar kill Mufasa

OMAR
Yeah in the film - but this is
real life I’m talking about So
Simba had a choice He could
either tell all his friends what
had happened and agree a
confusion or he could keep it a
secret and lead all his friends
in a big fight against Scar What
do you think he did

MAHMOOD
He had to tell the truth

OMAR
(bit impatient) But he’s got to
fight Scar hasn’t he Telling
the truth means giving up Would
Simba give up

MAHMOOD
Simba would never give up

4 LIONS SCRIPT at 311009

OMAR
Exactly Exactly So Simba kept
it all a secret And he lead
Pumba and Timon and all his
friends he lead them all ina
fight against Scar and they
vanquished Scar and Simba became
the new lion king

Yeah

The place is a constructive mess Bits of bomb making kit
abound White powder dries on paper plates Tupperware
boxes nuts and bolts tape and other bomb making kit THe
microwave they will later blow up In the kitchen several
saucepans of bleach are on the boil The extractor fan is
on Cannister for making dry ice A baby bath or two - for
the acetone adding stage And Fessal’s bottles all clutter
the surfacesOmar is at the hob

In the sitting room Hassan and Waj are taking it in turns
to detonate small quantities of TATP on their hands the
feeling is of a jackass escalation lg 2g etc This is
instantly detectable without having to see each phase
played out Barry is sitting on the floor - absorbed in a
construction of bolts and nails in a small tupperware box -
exquisitely neat

HASS
That’s twice as much bro

WAT
This one’s gonna make a mark

Hass holds hand out in trepidation Waj ignites the powder
with a cooker lighter Huge flash and puff They both
collapse in shocked thrilled laughter Fessal is filming
this on Hassan’s camera and turns his attention to Barry

BARRY
Jew gay fed Sodomite
Gynaecologist innocent bloke -

Here you give me that You do
some work

While doing this Barry looks up at Fessal He takes the
camera and turns it on Fessal who hurriedly puts a box on
his head Hass has finished packing the cannister Waj is
gorming with excitement

Barry swings the camera over to Hassan who raises the
cannister He hurls the cannister onto the floor
BOOOOOOM Stunned lull then post stunned jackass

Omar pops thru from the kitchen - half delighted but also
annoyed

OMAR
Come on lads Why don’t you just
pick up the phones and call the
cops Come on

HASSAN
Sorry man

Omar pops back in Fessal -peeping out from his box is
worried

FESSAL

BARRY
Course we do bro

FESSAL
Yeah but its our choice right

Omar pops back in to leave no doubt
OMAR
Fess it is your choice bro - it

can only be your choice

Fessal looks relieved Omar pops back into kitchen Barry
turns camera on Fessal again who retreats under his lid

BARRY
Fess it is your choice right -

yourself up haven’t you
Fessal stands there in his box

cU of a Crow sitting on a fence Wearing a fag packet on
its chest Fussing around this is Fessal He is wearing
protective cans And addressing the bird muttering to
himself to brother crow - a bundle of nerves A final
reminder to brother crow - they’ve been through this many
times before

FESSAL
Right now brother crow you’re

to alright See that (pointing
to a toy house) that’s
a sex shop - US embassy or some
other such slag utility Now wait
there When I say you fly to the
target when I dial this you go
to heaven brother crow Inshallah

He gets out the remote control and then holds up his hand
signaling the bird to wait then walk runs to 20 meters
away - hand still up - then signals the bird to attack by
pointing very vigourously to the sheep-shelter

Still on its perch the bird explodes Fessal double takes
Stares at the smoking perch Then throws an animated fit
Fessal is very upset the bang scared him - and he’s lost
his brother crow for no good reason Long lens of this

surroundings of norfolk

CUT TO

INT HANGER - DAY DAWN

The huge hangar is empty except for a single large shipping
container It doesn’t look large It looks very lonely -
by itself in the huge space

There are a couple of guards at the doorway of the hanger
(the human not the plane doorway which is shut)

CUT TO

INT CONTAINER AIRFORCE BASE - DAY DAWN xk

The container interior is bare Two US private security
guards stand behind Alex - who is seated across a desk from
Ahmed - dressed as an extraordinarily rendered detainee -
and seated uncomfortably on a metal chair

ALEX
This is RAF Mildenhall But it’s
acually Egypt When you entered the
base you left Britain and you
passed through US jurisdiction and
into this container which is
internationally recognised as the
sovereign territory of Egypt you
are now in Egypt

He pushes a little Egyptian flag across the table

ALEX CONT’D
There are some pretty hellish
Egyptians behind that door there
They use electrodes drills -
(hes genuinely upset by this)
And biro refillsDo you know what
I mean

AHMED
Please I dont know anything about
my brother

ALEX
We know a lot more than you think
we do

Alex looks genuinely outraged Ahmed is wild eyed trapped
Alex holds up a weetabix as if this will help prompt
something from Ahmed Needless to say it doesn’t
