FADE IN
EXT SARAS HOUSE - NIGHT

A cozy two-bedroom bungalow on a tree-lined street A newer
Jetta pulls into the driveway and comes to a stop JAKE
BREWER late 20s boyishly handsome with a cartoonists
permanently ink stained fingers emerges

Jakes seat belt catches in the door frame leaving the dome
light of his car on as he strides toward the

FRONT DOOR

Jake fingers the front door BUZZER and a moment later SARA
QUILL swings the door open cocking first her head and then
an eyebrow at Jake Sara is a kindergarten teacher in her
mid 20s with the kind of breezy beauty that other women will
spend thousands on in this city but never achieve

SARA
What are you doing here numb nuts

JAKE
Nice Sara You talk like that in
front of your kindergartners

SARA
Occasionally on Mondays Now I
asked you a question

JAKE

You had me staying over at your
brothers I spent the first three
hours saying uh huh as he laid
out the success of his new multi-
level internet marketing campaigns
and then mmm hmm in the following
two when we discussed how his new
Ping Zings have dramatically
improved his game Hence when he
wasnt looking I was forced to
accidentally drop a half dozen
Ambien into his non-caffinated non-
alcoholic beverage

(looking into distance)
Not that I wanted to but it had to
be done

SARA
Awesome so instead of Mark walking
me down the aisle tomorrow I get to
carry him

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
Remember lift with the legs not
the back

Sara punches Jake in the shoulder

JAKE (CONTD)
Ow

SARA
Thanks for the tip Now just so
Im clear Jake when me my mom
and my sister all reminded you
earlier today that its bad luck
for the groom to see the bride the
night before the wedding and told
you that under no circumstances
were you to show up here what part
didnt you get

JAKE
To be honest pretty much all of
it To begin with the concept of
luck is ridiculous What most
people refer to as luck is simply
random chance Add to that the
whole notion of it being unlucky
for a groom to see his bride before
the wedding dates back to when
marriages were arranged and women
were considered property and what
you end up with is a big pile of
antiquated sexist supernatural
silliness So can I come in

SARA
No Jake you may not You might
not believe in luck but I do I
was actually feeling pretty lucky
until you showed up For Christ
sake its one night Why even
chance it Thats just dumb

JAKE
Fine advocate away on behalf of
antiquated sexist supernatural
silliness Only problem is
technically this is the night
before our wedding and I have
officially seen you

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE (CONTD)

(pointing to eyes then

Sara)
Eyeballs - Sara So whatever
backwoods voodoo Mr Mojo Risin
curse there was to be incurred has
already occurred Except wait it
hasnt because luck doesnt exist

SARA
Youre positive on that

JAKE
If youd like Im willing to back
it up with further psychological
scientific and mathematical
constructs

SARA
You could do that Or if youll
just shut the fuck up you can come
in

Jake smiles as he mimes zipping his lips shut and throwing

away the
exaspera

key He then squeezes past Sara who sighs in
tion and pulls the front door shut

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jake sna

tches a beer from the fridge wielding a magnetic

bottle opener popping the top and sending it soaring into
the trash in one fluid movement He twirls the opener and

CLICKS i
enters

ts magnetic strip back onto the fridge as Sara

SARA
You know you can sling quite a load
of quasi-intelligent-sounding
bullshit for someone who makes his
living scribbling squiggles for the
funny papers

JAKE
One of the many benefits of a job
that only takes five minutes a day -
plenty of free time for wikipedia
research

SARA
You do realize wikipedia isnt
considered by most to be the be-all-
end-all of reliable information

(CONTTNURFD )

Sara grabs a glass from the cupboard and pours herself some
water from the fridge spout

JAKE
Hey dont go knocking wiki
Thats where I learned about that
alphabet oral trick you like so
much

SARA
(sips water then)
Well then I take it back
Wikipedia is the bees knees

JAKE
And youre the cats pjs for saying
so toots

SARA
Why thanks sailor So speaking
of men who proliferate venereal
disease how was your bachelor
party

JAKE
You know the usual

SARA
Some poor young girl with a sad
childhood degrading herself for you
and your collection of simian
friends

JAKE
No way Two poor young girls
with sad childhoods going to town
on each other with hot wax and
drilldos
(makes drilldo noises)
You know - classy

SARA
And you actually enjoyed this

Sara shakes her head and moves into the

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Sara slips over to the couch and pulls out a stack of
Kindergartners worksheets from a bag with lines drawn between
different animals and their corresponding sounds She sits

and grades them with either happy or sad faces as Jake
enters and leans against a bookcase

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
The sight of two women whose only
job requirement is to look good
naked pretending to be lesbians
grinding up on each other like two
otters fighting over an abalone
and then breaking out the high-
intensity-pussy-pleasuring-power-
tools - not at all I just
soldiered through it for the sake
of the other guys

SARA
Commendable really

JAKE
I thought so

Jakes slinks over and takes a seat next to Sara on the couch

SARA

God were getting married
tomorrow I cant believe I never
asked this

(dripping with sex)
After its been a couple years and
were settled in would that ever
be something youd be into You
know me you another woman

JAKE
I um well--

SARA
--Cuz its never gonna happen
Just thought you should know on the
basis of full disclosure

JAKE
(little boy pouting)
Okay That was officially mean

Sara cracks up
JAKE (CONTD)
So where are your mom and sister

anyway I thought theyd be over
here

(CONTTNURFD )

SARA
They were until they started
fighting over whether I should wear
my hair up or down and the great
veil or no veil debate Booted
â€˜em

JAKE
If I get a vote which I realize I
pretty much havent since I said
the words will you marry me I
vote hair up veil

SARA
Down no veil it is

JAKE
Just thought youd want something
to cover up your bloodshot eyes
after I keep you up late tonight

Jake smiles at Sara and raises his eyebrows
a look and then just walks out of the room laughing

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sara gives Jake

Sara lies in bed reading a travel brochure on a resort in the

Virgin Islands

WE HEAR THE FAUCET SHUT OFF IN THE BATHROOM

and Jake steps into the bedroom and crawls in next to her

JAKE
I know what you were doing The
whole laughing and walking out of
the room thing You were hoping
Id do what I normally do - take it
as a challenge and come in here and
rock your world so hard youd be
strolling around all day tomorrow
with the kind of completely relaxed
and glowing look only a woman whos
been totally sated by the Jakester
has

SARA
Darn you caught me Jakester

JAKE
Well you hurt my feelings and you
can just forget about it

(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE (CONTD)

I now plan on saving myself for the
honeymoon where girl you best start
preparing yourself now cuz Im
going to go all kinds of Jet Li
avenging the deaths of his entire
family and his dog up on your
booty

SARA
(points to brochure)
Neat And after that we can go
para-sailing

JAKE
(excited about the idea)
Cool Cuz that whole Jet Li thing
shouldnt take more than like five
minutes And Ive never been para-
sailing

Sara chuckles
SARA
(sweetly)

You make me laugh

Jake leans over and they kiss softly Sara kisses back for a
moment then breaks and slips a finger over Jakes lips

SARA (CONTD)
But youre still not getting lucky
tonight
JAKE
Well then its a good thing for me
I dont believe in luck

Jake leans in toward Sara again Sara turns away reaching
for the light on her end table

SARA
And a bad thing for you that I do

Sara shuts off the light and shuts down Jake
EXT SARAS HOUSE - MORNING

Birds chirp and the sprinklers sprinkle
INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Jake sits at the kitchen table in his wedding tux carefully
sipping his morning coffee He HEARS THE CLICK OF HEELS and
turns to see

SARA WALKING TOWARD HIM IN SLOW MOTION The way the morning
light is shining through her hair and in her beautiful dress
she could be an angel FULL SPEED

SARA
Figured since you already blew the
good luck thing you could at least
let me know how I look

JAKE
(a whisper)
Wow
SARA
Wow
JAKE

Well before you came in I was
worried about getting my bow tie
straight but now I realize Id have
to light myself on fire for anyone
to be looking at me

SARA
(smiles )
Glad I could help

JAKE
I should go

Jake stands and backs his way out of the kitchen still
stunned by Saras beauty in her dress

JAKE (CONTD)
Wow

EXT JAKE AND SARAS HOUSE - DAY

Jake strides down the front walk a smile on his face Its
knocked off by the SLAP of a newspaper Jake shakes his head
and bends to pick it up

JAKE
Thank you

WIDER as a 12 year-old PAPER GIRL swings her bike around and
rides up to Jake

(CONTTNURFD )

PAPER GIRL
Sorry You okay

JAKE
Ill live

PAPER GIRL
You going to the prom or something

JAKE
(laughs)
No Im getting married today

PAPER GIRL
To the lady that lives here

JAKE
Sure am

PAPER GIRL
Youre lucky Shes pretty

JAKE
Nothing to do with luck But
thanks

PAPER GIRL
You dont seem like youre all that
to me

JAKE

I didnt mean it like that But
thanks again I just meant I dont
believe in luck

PAPER GIRL

You should Youre gonna need it
Over half of all marriages end in
divorce But if the sex is good
it should last for a few years
anyway Thats what I heard my mom
say about my uncle Im assuming
thats why youre here even though

(chastising tone)
it is bad luck to see the bride
before the wedding

JAKE

Thats really none of your
business How old are you anyway

(CONTTNURFD )

PAPER GIRL
I didnt say it was I said I was
assuming And Im twelve

JAKE
Well for you information Little
Miss Mouthy youre wrong We
didnt do anything last night and
weve been saving ourselves for
marriage just like you should

PAPER GIRL
Listen you seem okay But please
dont condescend to me Its not
nice Id wish you luck but since
you dont believe in it guess Ill
just be seeing ya

The Paper Girl pedals off leaving Jake looking like hes been
hit between the eyes with a baseball bat He shakes it off

and then strides over to

JAKES JETTA

Jake notices the open door but hops inside anyway He puts

his keys in the ignition and tries to start it

It WHINES

BUT WONT TURN OVER Jake pounds on the steering wheel

JAKE
Fuckity-fuck-fuck-shitty-shit-fuck

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sara is sitting on the couch as Jake enters pulling a

suitcase behind him

SARA
Forget something

JAKE
Not to get my seat belt jammed in
the door frame leaving the inside
light of my car on and killing the
battery

SARA
Better call a cab

JAKE
The limo should be here to pick you
up any minute Why cant I just go
with you

(CONTTNURFD )

SARA
Because Id prefer my whole family
didnt know you spent the night
after my mom and sister told you to
stay away No need for everyone to
know what a jerk Im marrying

JAKE
Like they need further
conformation Theyve met me
(off Saras look)
If it matters that much to you just
drop me off a block away okay

SARA
Fine But do me a favor Lose all
that crap youve got in your
pockets Its making your tux hang
funny

JAKE
Alright but I already told you no
ones going to be looking at me

SARA
I will

Jake empties his cell phone wallet Pez a roll of quarters
a broken pocket watch and a lot more into his bag

Sara watches in confused awe as the process seemingly goes on

forever

LATER

Sara and Jake sit next to each other on the couch in silence
for a moment before she grabs Jakes wrist and checks his

watch

SARA
God wheres the damn limo already

JAKE
Yeah hes only got five minutes
left to be on time so he can get us
to the church two and a half hours
before our wedding
(dripping with sarcasm)
I think we should start to panic

(CONTTNURFD )

SARA
Jake could you please just be on
my side in hoping this wedding will
go perfectly

JAKE
Hey Im always on your side And
Ill hope Ill even pray if you
want me to but theres no way
thats going to happen

SARA
Yeah since you jinxed us by
showing up last night

JAKE
No because in real life nothing
ever does Maybe your aunt Sophie
will break a heal and trip when she
gets up to sing or itll rain at
the reception or youll keep
looking at me that way grab a
knife out of the kitchen and stab
me in the face in the next two
minutes My point before you go
Ginsu is that all I need to make
today perfect is you loving me
enough to marry me

SARA
(a beat)
Fuck you
JAKE
Fuck me
SARA

Yes fuck you You always do that
You drive me crazy pointing out
and picking on my neuroses and then
you say shit like that

JAKE
Shit like what

SARA
The most beautiful and romantic
thing Ive ever heard See cuz
now I have to marry you even if
today is a total disaster You
tricked me Youre a bastard

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
Am I at least a cute bastard

Jake grins and raises and eyebrow Sara grins back despite

herself and then jumps up when the DOORBELL BUZZES

SARA
Come on

Jake takes his time but finally rises

EXT JAKE AND SARAS HOUSE - DAY

Jake stands with GEORGE POPOVICH at the back of a limo parked
behind his car in the driveway helping George load four bags

into the trunk

GEORGE
You guys going on a long honeymoon

JAKE
A week The little bag there is
mine Feel free to mention to Sara
that she might have overpacked

GEORGE
Not a chance Ive been married
eight months myself My wife

weekend I hope this wont affect
my tip but youre kind of a jerk

JAKE

passengers

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE

INT LIMO - TRAVELING - DAY

George is behind the wheel Jake and Sara holding hands in
the back seat

GEORGE
Days like this I really love my
job Drunken kids going to prom I

couple like you two about to start
their lives together - its really
great And I want you to know not
to pay any attention to that
garbage people talk about marriage
these days I can tell you from
experience its the best

JAKE
No offence But you did tell me
youve only been married for like
eight months

GEORGE
Eight perfect months Before I met
my wife I was a mess Drinking
too much looking for trouble and
I had a real weight problem

JAKE
The hell you say

GEORGE
I know hard to believe Every
other woman I was ever with
eventually ended up giving me crap
over it Not Laura She really
loves me for who I am Once we
were together not having the
stress of worrying she was judging
me or gonna leave me over my
weight I started to eat less
Then I started going on walks like
she does just to be with her and
Ive lost like fifty pounds I
feel like I did back in High
School like a sleek panther

George looks over his shoulder at Jake and Sara and makes a
panther growl and claws toward them cracking them up

(CONTTNURFD )

GEORGE (CONTD)
Okay a large sleek panther but a
sleek panther none the less You
want to see her

SARA
Sure

George pulls out his wallet and holds it over his shoulder
open to a picture of LAURA 30s a plus-sized beauty

SARA (CONTD)
Shes gorgeous

JAKE
Looks like you got yourself a
winner man

GEORGE

Dont I know it Im telling you
our love is going to last forever
(to picture)

Look at you Laura Youve got me
blabbering on like a sappy greeting
card

SARA
We think its sweet Dont we

JAKE
(trying not to laugh)
Yeah sure

Sara elbows Jake and George puts away his wallet

SARA
Thats weird The woman in the
passenger seat of that car that
just passed looked just like her

GEORGE
(unsure)
Not possible Laura said she was
staying around the house today
doing laundry

George speeds up and pulls along side a beat up Toyota
Corolla

GEORGES POV - Laura sits next to a HANDSOME BLACK MAN who
drives

(CONTTNURFD )

GEORGE (CONTD)
Jesus that is her What the hell
is my Laura doing in that car with
that guy

SARA
Maybe hes an old friend

GEORGE
I know all of her old friends and
he aint none of them

SARA
Someone she works with

GEORGE
(makes BUZZER NOISE
getting upset)
But thanks for playing

EXT WEST ADAMS - DAY

Ice Cube would avoid

INT LIMO - TRAVELING - DAY

JAKE
I hate to be a pain but you kinda

Then do me a favor and just sit
there and shut the fuck up or I
swear to Jimmity Christ I will do
us all including you her me and
my cheating whore of a wife all in
one big fiery fucking explosion

LATER

George looks crazed his fingers digging into the steering
wheel In the back seat Sara and Jake anxiously whisper
back and forth

SARA

and let us out

(CONTTNURFD )

Jake and Sara exchange a no way look

EXT WRONG SIDE OF 10 FREEWAY (WEST ADAMS) - DAY

Shoes are strewn by their laces over phone lines We BOOM
DOWN from the shoes to the limo driving past

Sara and Jake continue their nervous whispering

SARA
Well you can at least say
something to him

JAKE

Jake leans forward
JAKE (CONTD)

George I want you to know I can
understand that youre upset

GEORGE
(doesnt give a shit)
Thanks
JAKE

But lets be reasonable You said
yourself how much Laura loves you
Im sure theres a perfectly good

explanation why shes in that car

with that guy

(CONTTNURFD )

GEORGE
They fuck every time I go to work
and this is one of those times

JAKE
That or something else The point
is wouldnt it be better to just
finish your job drive us to the
church and then talk about it with
her after you get home and have a
little time to cool down

GEORGE
Theyre pulling over

George pulls the limo to the curb

GEORGES POV - the Corolla is parked in front of an apartment

building

GEORGE (CONTD)
Please dont let her go into that
apartment building with him
Please do not let her go into that
apartment building with him

GEORGES POV - the Handsome Black Man and Laura stride into

the apartment building

GEORGE (CONTD)

Well then

(suddenly very nice)
I apologize to you both for
bringing you here Im usually a
very proficient and reliable
driver Now if youll excuse me
I have some humans to kill

George reaches over and opens the glove box pulling out a
9mm pistol He then opens the drivers door and exits

Jake and Sara look to each other

SARA
What should we do

JAKE
Well we could wait here for him to
get done inside and then decide to
eliminate witnesses

Jake points back and forth between himself and Sara

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE (CONTD)
Or WE COULD RUN

EXT DENKER ST AND 36TH PLACE - DAY

Jake and Sara haul ass away from the limo their wedding
attire not making for the best running gear

EXT 36TH PLACE - TWO BLOCKS AWAY - DAY

Jake and Sara continue running until Sara grabs Jakes arm to
stop him

SARA
Wait Chances are hes just going
to go in there and find out theres
nothing going on Theyve only
been married for eight months why
would she have married him in the
first place if she was going to
cheat on him already

JAKE
Thats a good point And he did
seem really nice before he saw his
wife with that other guy I know
he was talking crazy but I dont
think hed really be capable of--

--BANG BANG BANG Three shots ring out Sara and Jakes
eyes bug out at each other and they take off like track
stars

EXT WEST ADAMS - DAY

Jake and Sara dont look back as they wind their way
haphazardly through this run-down neighborhood

EXT HARVARD AND ADAMS - DAY
Jake and Sara continue running for a moment until Sara has
had all the running she can take She doubles over gasping

for air

SARA
Jake stop

Jake circles back to Sara

SARA (CONTD)
Do you even know where we are

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
Farther away from the homicidal
madman with the gun than we used to
be

SARA
I think were far enough Use your
cell phone and call the cops

JAKE
I would if someone didnt tell me
it was ruining the lines of my tux
I got nothing No cell phone No
wallet Nothing And look at us
Were in the middle of Kill Whitey-
ville

SARA
Hey thats kind of racist

JAKE
Not as racist as that

Jake points out the large Kill Whitey graffiti on the wall
behind them

SARA
Okay Point taken Now lets just
stay focused All we have to do is
find a pay-phone and we can call
the police

JAKE
And spend the next twelve hours
answering their questions and miss
our wedding

SARA
Not if we make an anonymous tip and
then call a cab to pick us up

JAKE
Okay thats smart I would have
never thought of that

SARA
I know Thats why I said it

JAKE
And thats why I love you

(CONTTNURFD )

SARA
Save the mushy stuff will you
Weve got a wedding to get to
Lets go

Jake follows Sara as she continues down the street

JAKE
You do realize the irony of your
last statement

SARA
(sarcastic)
No My last statement was Lets
go I dont see any irony in
that

Jake smirks She got him They continue on

JAKE
You know if we survive this were
going to have a really great story
to tell

SARA
About how you showed up the night
before our wedding jinxed us and
we ended up with a shit-house-rat-
crazy limo driver

JAKE
The one thing has nothing to do
with the other

SARA
Well if its not bad luck then it
must be someones fault I wonder
who could it be

JAKE
I dont know maybe the person who
pointed out our limo drivers wife
with another man

SARA
Thats not fair If you had seen
her you would have done the same
thing

JAKE
Probably All Im saying is it
wasnt luck We both made
decisions that have led us here
(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE (CONTD)
I made the little mistake of hiring
the cheapest limo company available
and you made the monumental mistake
of pointing out that the driver for
said company has or rather had a
two-timing floozie with wheels on
her heels for a wife But like you
said lets stay focused I think
I see a bodega on the next corner
They might have a phone

Sara pauses to give Jake the stink-eye then quick steps it
to catch up to him

EXT BODEGA 36ST AND WESTERN AVE - DAY

Jake and Sara stand outside a seedy bodega Jake picks up
the receiver of a pay phone and holds it to his ear

JAKE
Bad news is no dial tone Really
bad news is I may now have ear
herpes
(freaking out)
Its freakin wet

Jake hangs up the phone and rubs his ear with the shoulder of
his jacket

SARA
Wet Thats disgusting Why would
it be wet What could it be

JAKE
Dont know Dont want to think
about it Lets try inside

Jake and Sara both shudder back and forth for a moment
almost like its a contest to see who can be more disgusted
They then head into

INT BODEGA - DAY

indeterminable origin resides

pulls up to the intersection and stops at the light

JAKE
Sara I think its really sweet how

Jake grabs Saras hand and pulls her down an

ALLEYWAY (7TH AND LEELAND)

running along the back of a group of storefronts

Jake pulls at a door to one of the back storerooms

SARA

fully cocked guns pointing at them A coke deal is going
down Four men stand at a table two on either side and two
kilos of blow and a briefcase full of money between them

The two on the left are FRANK WHITE and DRAKE SMITTY SMITS
Frank is the boss equal parts crazy and smart with cold
eyes and a Texas accent Smitty is Franks brother-in-law
and is too stupid and good-natured goofy to be here if it
wasnt for nepotism On the right are the James brothers
DEX and DEVON Theyd both shoot you just so they could bet
on how long it took you to die

FRANK
Hey Smitty do you think it might
have been a good idea to lock that
door after you let in Dex and
Devon

SMITTY
I thought I did

FRANK
Then why am I staring at the top of
a wedding cake

SMITTY
(shrugs)
I dont know Why

FRANK

Smitty heads over to Jake and Sara
FRANK (CONTD)
And lock the fucking door this

Sara and Jake are frozen with fear They whisper to each
other

SARA

JAKE

No youre not Just stay calm and
whatever I do play along

(CONTTNURFD )

Dex reaches for the briefcase full of money

DEX

FRANK

find a chain link fence with barb wire in their way

first dumpster they passed and slams the top open

JAKE (CONTD)
Quick get in

SARA

wall beside him He and Sara scream and duck down behind the
dumpster

JAKE

keep it from moving and pulls it out

Hold on Stay low and move that
way

Jake and Sara slide along the wall toward another dumpster

Smitty gun out prowls down the alley He reaches the
dumpster where Jake and Sara were and jumps leveling his gun
at them but theyre not there

Jake springs up from behind the next dumpster and charges
Smitty breaking the two-by-four over the back of Smittys
head Smitty is stunned but still on his feet

SMITTY
That really fucking hurt

Smitty starts to turn his gun on Jake but Jake grabs his arm
and tackles him against the alleyway wall They struggle and
a shot is fired the ricochet nearly hitting Sara

Jake continues to pound Smittys arm into the wall and the
gun comes free of Smittys hand A hand that Smitty now
balls into a fist and uses to beat the hell out of Jake

As Jake falls to his knees and Smitty is about to unload on
him with another right Sara jumps between them holding
Smittys gun

SARA
Stop

SMITTY
Hold on little girl We both know
you dont have it in you to kill
anyone So why dont you just hand
that gun back over to me

SARA
You really think you can mess with
a woman on her wedding day and get
away with it

Sara lowers the gun and pulls the trigger BANG
SMITTY
Agh She shot me in the balls
She shot me in the fucking balls
Smitty grabs said appendages falling to his knees as Sara

helps Jake to his feet and they hobble back out the blind
alleyway

(CONTTNURFD )

SMITTY (CONTD)
You bitch Agh

Jake finally is moving under his own power He looks to Sara
as they continue

JAKE
I know he was trying to kill us
But shooting a guy in the nuts
You know thats wrong right

SARA
It worked didnt it

JAKE
Of course it worked And Im not
saying you didnt do good Im
just saying you could have shot him
in the leg or something

SARA
I was aiming for his leg

JAKE
Oh never mind then
(over his shoulder to

Were in the trunk of a car on our
way to die and youre making jokes

JAKE
Its how I deal with stress

SARA
Its how you deal with everything

eventually had a kid but they have
some sort of deformity--

JAKE
--Third eye

Whatever You would probably make
a joke out of it

(CONTTNURFD )

out of her back we could call Handy
Mandy

SARA
Jake

JAKE
What Just because I choose to
make light of bad situations
doesnt mean Im making less of
them You tell me what would be
better for a kid like that Having
parents who prepare him or her for
the sting of how cruel the world is
or being the kind of parents whod
pretend theres nothing wrong
What extra arm Youre perfect
just the way God made you honey
Now dont forget your third mitten

SARA

Just forget I said anything Its
pointless In your mind Im sure
were dead already

Because itd take a miracle to get
us out of this And theres no way
someone who doesnt even believe in
luck could believe in something
like that

SARA
Then what would you call it

JAKE
I dont know A balancing out
Given who we are the odds of us
accidentally running into the
middle of a drug deal are through
the roof The chances that wed be
saved from the repercussions of
that situation by a pot smoking
hippy Taliban sleeper agent Im
guessing are right up there too
So yeah balance

Jake holds his hands out gesturing balance

SARA
Balance I cant believe how full
of shit you are Theres no
logical reason we should be alive
And instead of marveling in the
fact that were not dead and how
were not you want to act like
that back there is something you
see every day

JAKE
Sara we dont really have time to
fight about this Our wedding
starts in
(checks watch)
less than half an hour

SARA
I dont know if I want to marry
someone who doesnt believe in any
sort of magic or mystery in the
world Especially when its
staring them right in the face At
the very least why cant you admit
how lucky we just were

JAKE
I dont believe it was luck
Because you know I dont believe in
luck But that doesnt mean I
dont believe in any magic or
mystery in the world

SARA

So what type of magic or mystery do
you believe in

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
Why dont you let me tell you on
the way to the church If you
still feel the same way when we get
there you can go in and tell
everyone the weddings off But at
least that way Ill know youre
safe

Sara gives Jake a gentle acquiescing nod and he fires up the
Cadi and pulls away

dealt with it very well Kind of
turned me into a smart ass Dont
know if youve noticed Anyhow
he was a high school science
teacher and from the time I can
remember he was always telling me
there are patterns and an order to
everything in the universe even if
we cant recognize or see them So
thats why when people talk about
things like luck or fate Im not
just going to join in

SARA
Because youd feel like you were
betraying his memory

JAKE
Something like that But like I
said that doesnt mean I dont
believe this world isnt full of
magic Do you remember the first
time we met

(CONTTNURFD )

SARA
The laundromat

INT LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Jake loads a dryer with a months worth of clothes He
finishes and pops quarters into the slot starting the dryer

A few dryers down Sara loads a nice selection of frilly
under-things Jake notices but darts his eyes away not
wanting to seem pervy as Sara moves to the change machine and
tries to slip in a dollar No luck

Sara slides back over to Jake holding out her dollar
SARA

You wouldnt happen to have any
extra quarters

JAKE
I might but itll cost you
SARA
More than a dollar for four
quarters
JAKE

A cup of coffee at the place around
the corner while we wait for our
clothes to dry

SARA
Hmm wet underwear or take a chance
on random laundromat dude
JAKE
Take your time I can understand
Its a tough decision
Sara smirks and shoves her dollar at Jake who takes it and
then gives her four quarters Sara uses them to start her
dryer and then saunters with Jake over to the door He opens
it for her and she smiles

SARA
Thanks

Jake follows Sara out and the door closes behind him
INT FRANKS CADILAC - TRAVELING - DAY

Sara looks over to Jake perplexed

(CONTTNURFD )

INT SARA

Jake and Sara hump like bunnies under the covers

SARA
What about that was magical I
needed quarters and you blackmailed
me

JAKE
Id hardly call it blackmail But
check this out One I never used
to do laundry during the day Two
I never would bring my own
quarters I just happened to that
day And three you were wearing a
pink sun dress

SARA
The dress was magical

JAKE
Yes because it reminded me of one
my third grade teacher Miss Winter
used to wear Theres no way you
could have know that or that she
was my favorite teacher growing up
And then were having coffee and
what do you tell me you do fora
living--

SARA
--Im a teacher--

JAKE
--It blew my mind It may not seem
like it to you But finding a
beautiful kind giving woman in
this city who just happened to need
quarters that I just happened to
have and who looked amazing in a
pink sun dress was a miracle to me
And thats just the start Do you
remember what we did a couple weeks
later after dinner at that Thai
place

S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

SARA
Yes Yes Fuck me Fuck me
Fuck me harder Agh

INT FRANKS CADILAC - TRAVELING - DAY

SARA
Youre saying that was a miracle

JAKE
I found my performance and how hard
you came to be quite miraculous
But no I meant afterward

INT SARAS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jake spoons into Saras back holding her tight

JAKE (VO)
You were the first woman I was ever
with that afterward I wasnt
thinking about how fast I could get
out of there

INT FRANKS CADILAC - TRAVELING - DAY
Jake turns to Sara to make sure she sees he means this

JAKE
Because I was in love with you
Everything leading up to and since
that moment has been magic to me
Its not something I can explain
with reason or define with logic
Its just something that happened
and I felt

Sara looks over at Jake She gasps and her eyes widen

SARA
dake

SARAS POV - Frank behind the wheel of a Crown Victoria is
seconds from plowing it right into Jakes door We CUT TO
BLACK and HEAR THE GRATING METAL-ON-METAL CRASH

EXT HOLLYWOOD STREET - DAY

Sara falls out of the passenger door of Franks wrecked Cadi
followed by Jake Theyre both dazed As they start to get
their bearings Frank pops up from around the front of his
Cadi

FRANK

LoJack ya fucknuts Now wheres
Smitty

(CONTTNURFD )

Frank takes a step toward them and cocks his gun

FRANK (CONTD)
I asked you a fucking question

Jake motions to the truck of the Cadi which has popped open
from the impact Frank moves over to it keeping his eye on
Jake and Sara who move back to let him through

FRANKS POV - Of Smittys dead body

FRANK (CONTD)

Oh Jesus fuck me with a
rattlesnake

(to Smitty)
You were one useless son bitch

(to Jake and Sara)
But he was also family My wife is
gonna hit the fucking roof But at
least Im gonna be able to console
her with the fact that the people
responsible for this are dead

Frank lifts his gun to aim it at Sara

JAKE
Wait It wasnt us

FRANK
I suppose youre gonna tell me it
was that sand bitch who I ran over
doing forty I dont give a shit
either way And dont you worry
Ill find her and shell be joining
you real soon

Frank lifts his gun and aims at Jake this time BANG

Jake looks confused as to why hes not dead

REVERSE ANGLE on Frank to reveal he has a bullet hole in the
center of his head As Frank falls to his knees we SHIFT

FOCUS to a HAND HOLDING A GUN behind him and then WIDEN OUT
to reveal the owner of the gun GEORGE the limo driver

SARA
(emotionally exhausted)
Please dont kill us

GEORGE
Kill you Im pretty sure I just
saved your lives Why would I want
to kill you

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
The whole Ive got humans to kill
thing earlier

GEORGE
That wasnt directed at the two of
you and it was just a stupid
mistake Green eyed monster got
the best of me

SARA
So you didnt shoot anyone

GEORGE
Not till now Who exactly did I
shoot by the way

JAKE
He was a cop but hes dirty But
we heard shots at that apartment

GEORGE
I shot the door off the hinges
And then I go inside and Lauras
negotiating with this guy to buy an
autographed Jim Brown helmet for my
birthday Originally from
Cleveland Big Browns fan Now
if you dont mind youve got a
wedding to get to and Id kind of
like to get some distance between
me and the dead officer of the law
I just executed Limos right
there

George points behind himself

JAKE
George you really are a reliable
and proficient limo driver

GEORGE
Two rules One nobody messes with
my car And two nobody messes
with my passengers

Sara quickly bends and picks up Franks gun as George tucks
his into the back of his pants

JAKE

Sara what are you doing You hate
guns

(CONTTNURFD )

SARA
True But if anyone tries to stop
us before we say I do theyre
gonna suck on my metal cock

JAKE
Jesus Sara
(serious)
Thats the most romantic thing Ive
ever heard

GEORGE (0S)
Come on

CLOSE UP of Sara tucking Franks gun into her garter belt

Jake and Sara then stride quickly for the limo Jake gets
Saras door and then races over to the other side and hops
inside

ANGLE BEHIND LIMO - as it pulls away We see Jake and Sara
look into each others eyes and kiss passionately and SLOWLY
DISSOLVE TO

EXT VIRGIN ISLANDS - BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON a small table filled with tropical drinks A hand
reaches for one and we WIDEN OUT TO REVEAL it belongs to
Jake who is lounged out next to Sara on matching beach
chairs

JAKE
Mrs Brewer could you rub a little
more lotion into my shoulders

SARA
Id be delighted Mr Brewer

Sara snags a bottle of sun tan lotion from a bag at her feet
pours some into her hands and rubs Jakes shoulders

JAKE
I was just doing the Mrs Brewer
thing cuz its new to you Since I
became a man Ive always been Mr
Brewer

SARA
Since youve became a man So
since last Tuesday then

JAKE
Around that time

(CONTTNURFD )

Sara squirts some more lotion into her hand and it PLOPS out
and shoots down her arm

SARA
(a little too upset)
Damnit
JAKE

Hey its just lotion You still
seem a little tense Look around
I know technically its still US
soil but I think were pretty
safe

SARA
Yeah I guess so

JAKE
I know so I told you I talked to
George and he said he took care of
that gun you threw down the gutter

SARA
I know I just still have this
horrible feeling that someone is
going to pop up and get us

Jake spins around and rubs Saras shoulders looking into her

eyes

JAKE
(gentle tone as he rubs)
Shhh No one is going to get us
okay Just listen to the ocean

SARA
(smiles )
Very nice

Jake leans in to kiss Sara but before their lips can touch
Christopher in a Speedo and with a bandage on his head pops
up between them

CHRISTOPHER
We found you

Jake and Sara let out STARTLED SCREAMS

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
Its just me - Christopher Hi

(CONTTNURFD )

Christopher waves with his enormous smile in place

WIDER as Jane moves in behind Christopher and puts a hand on
his shoulder

JANE

Christopher you startled them
SARA

What are you guys doing here
CHRISTOPHER

I wanted to thank you
JAKE

For what
CHRISTOPHER

If it wasnt for you two bringing
those bad men to our apartment Id
still be afraid to go outside But
look at me

Christopher runs around in circles laughing then plops back
down where he was

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
Getting shot by them made me
realize you dont even have to go
outside to have metal shoot through
your head And the doctors said if
I didnt already have the Titanium
plate in my head that deflected
that bullet Id be dead How
lucky is that

SARA
It wasnt luck Luck doesnt
exist It was just a series of
random occurrences that came out in
your favor Right Jake

JAKE
I dont know Sounds pretty lucky
to me

SARA
You jerk

Sara playfully hits Jake on the shoulder

(CONTTNURFD )

CHRISTOPHER
No Jakes right It was super
lucky because now I can finally
enjoy the money I got from the
settlement from that construction
company Like coming to places
like this Look at all this sand
This is awesome

Christopher runs around and then Supermans onto the sand and
rolls around

SARA
(to Jane)
How are you doing

JANE
Much better now that Im finally
sure who I am Jane Doe nice to
meet you

Jane offers her hand and Sara shakes it followed by Jake

SARA
Nice to meet you too Jane Doe

ANGLE ON Christopher who has moved a few feet away and humps
the sand

CHRISTOPHER
Man this feels really good You

JANE
Christopher

Jake cracks up and the girls give him a look like last time
but this time they join in his laughter Jake picks up his
glass and holds it up Sara grabs hers and they toast with a
CLINK and we PULL UP AND AWAY and

FADE OUT

The End
