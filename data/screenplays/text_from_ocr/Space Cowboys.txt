SUPERIMPOSE OCTOBER 1958

The successful launch of Sputnik I has
started rumors that manned space flight
is a year away for the Soviet Union The
United States has assumed the titanic
challenge of Taking the high ground of
space

EXT USAF PROVING GROUND (CALIFORNIA HIGH DESERT) - DAY

A SONIC BOOM in the crystal blue desert sky A modified
Bell Labs X-2 Ultrasonic JET -- basically a rocket with
stubby wings that look more like vestigial fins --
SCREAMS upwards an 80 degree climb into space On its
side is stylishly painted Daedalus

INT X- JET - CLOSE ON ALTIMETER - THAT MOMENT
108999 FEET THE 999s roll over
The pilots voice strains with the G-forces and thin oxygen

PILOT (V0O)
109000 Come on Frank lets
poke our nose into space

The pilot is Major WILLIAM HAWK HAWKINS 26 In
the seat behind him is MAJOR FRANK CORVIN 29 Both wear
bulky pressure suits and space helmets

FRANK
No Thats enough Hawk Were
approaching heat barrier Lets
level off
(into his radio)
Recover One this is Falcon
Beginning descent now

INT AIR FORCE B- - THAT MOMENT

Twelve miles below the X-2 Barrel-chested buzz-cutted
Captain TANK SULLIVAN is at the controls

TANK
Roger Daedalus Got you on the
scope Frank

Tank sharpens the radar blip As he does we see a
plastic hula girl on the instrument panel dancing
frenetically

INT X- - THAT MOMENT

The altimeter hits 110000 Frank and Hawk are breathing
harder

HAWK
Bingo 110000th floor ladies
lingerie
The DRONE of the rocket MOTOR HESITATES -- a nanosecond
at most -- then RESUMES as normal
FRANK

You catch that Hawk
Hawk is in the zone listening and feeling the airplane

FRANK
Hawk

EXT DESERT GROUND BELOW -- THAT MOMENT

Captain JERRY ONEILL sits outside a USAF truck in front
of a radar screen reading a Playboy magazine He reads
the copy aloud to himself

JERRY
Miss September herself a
promising student pilot has a
particular weakness for structural
engineers with PhDs in astro-
physics

He slowly moves the Playboy away and sees a scorpion
climbing his bare ankle He rolls up the magazine
tightly holds it above the scorpion ready to swat it
He looks at the scorpion he looks at Miss Septembers
smiling face and airbrushed-breast

He cant do it he cant sully this redheaded vision He
calmly grabs the scorpion by its stinger tail and flings
it Hawks voice crackles over the RADIO
HAWK (VO)
Shes alright shes talking to me
You trust me dont you Frank

JERRY
Uh oh here we go again

INT X- - THAT MOMENT

THROUGH the canopy -- the horizon -- the blue turns to
black Hawk and Frank are touching outer space

HAWK
Frank look

The full moon is rising over the curvature of the Earth

HAWK
(calm faraway voice)
Thats where were going I dont
know how I dont know when

Frank looks up from the gauges at the horizon He is
mesmerized speechless Hawk starts to sing Awesome
pilot lousy singer

HAWK
Fly me to the moon and let me play
among the stars --

Frank looks out the window at the moon The ROCKET MOTOR
HESITATES AGAIN SPUTTERS and GOES SILENT All the gauges
drop to zero Engine failure Frank is jolted back to
reality

FRANK
Holy God

All we hear is the WIND buffeting the plane and the eerie
sound of the planes airframe and body skin CREAKING
Hawk works frantically to restart the engine trying to
joke through it

HAWK
Hey Frank wanna get out and
gimme a push

FRANK
Sonofabitch
Theyre nosing over beginning what every pilot dreads
most -- a flat spin The cockpit ALARM SOUNDS
HAWK

We have to eject

FRANK
At 112000 feet Are you outta
your mind

HAWK
Were not gonna ride this thing out
Call Mayday -- were popping

FRANK
(gasping for air)
We are not losing another
ship
EXT X- - THAT MOMENT

Spinning wildly plummeting towards ground The right
wing shudders and rips away -- the plane inverts in its
spin

INT X- - THAT MOMENT

HAWK
Dont think about it Frank Just
do it Im gonna count down to
one Ready One

Hawk yanks the T-handle The explosive BOLTS BLOW the
canopy off Two screams one of terror one of joy
as they eject the supersonic wind hitting them like a
truck

Frank and Hawk are in free fall -- 22 miles over the
desert Approaching the speed of sound they scream
towards Earth Frank is paralyzed in a still fall

Hawk tumbles and soars like his namesake living every
mans ultimate fantasy -- pure flight Side by side he
seems to taunt Frank as he flies about Frank pulls his
rip cord at 22000 arresting his fall Hawk keeps right
on going

EXT GROUND - THAT MOMENT
Jerry binoculars trained skyward sees Franks parachute
deploy at exactly the moment he hears the thundering BOOM
of the plane crashing into the desert floor

JERRY

Thats gotta be Frank but
wheres Hawk

EXT SKY - THAT MOMENT

Hawk is soaring spinning laughing and screaming
ignoring the ground coming up quick

INT B- - THAT MOMENT

Tank searches through the windscreen for Hawk when
Hawk-- a flailing flash really -- free-falls right past
the cockpit windshield startling Tank

TANK
Whooa shit
He banks the huge plane hard left to avoid hitting him
Tank grimly takes the dancing hula girl off the
instrument panel replaces her with a plastic dashboard
Jesus

EXT SKY - HAWK

One thousand feet -- Mach one plus Sluggish lethargic
almost out He wills his eyes open to see the ground
coming up mighty fast and pulls the cord the chute
releases A gut-wrenching force nearly yanks him out of
the harness as he is pulled skyward -- 700 mph to zero in
three seconds He opens his face plate gulping air
laughing like a schoolboy

EXT GROUND - THAT MOMENT
Jerry laughs relieved when he sees the second chute
He climbs into the truck tosses the Playboy aside and
STARTS the ENGINE
JERRY
Crazy son of a bitch almost made

like a bug on a windshield

Hawk touches down easily He falls back on his chute
elated

CUT TO

EXT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE - THAT MOMENT

Establishing

INT OFFICE - DAY

The office of Major BOB GERSON Air Force Special
Projects Administrator Only 27 Gerson already has the
look of a polished bureaucrat He looks out the
panoramic window behind his desk at a thick black column
of smoke rising above the desert -- obviously the
experimental X-2 SIRENS audible

His look is neither alarm nor concern He studies the
scene coldly and objectively like a scientist And his
eyes seem to smile as though this is no real catastrophe
to him

CUT TO

EXT DESERT - THAT MOMENT

As Frank descends he lifts his faceplate and looks out
at --

A column of black smoke on the horizon -- where the X-2
crashed
Frank touches down -- not quite as graceful or elated as

Hawk Matter of fact he tumbles over caught in the

chute and rigging A look of single-minded revenge on
his face Frank unharnesses himself and charges toward
Hawk awkwardly in his stiff cumbersome pressure suit
Hawk sits up howls with joy

HAWK
112000 and I feel fine Lets do
it again Frank

Frank punches Hawk through the open faceplate of his
helmet knocking him off his feet

FRANK
You always have to push things to
their limit dont you

HAWK
Thats what I do best Frank

Frank dives on him they lock up in a fight Jerry jumps
out of the just-arriving truck and dives into the melee
trying to pull them apart

CUT TO

INT BOB GERSONS OUTER OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

Frank enters literally hat in hand Hawk follows him
in hat still on his head Frank swipes it off shoves
it into his hands The duty sergeant opens Gersons
door

INT GERSONS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

They enter Gerson faces out his panoramic window -- we
can still see the smoke from the brush fire caused by the
crash of the X-2

GERSON
Is that smoke I smell Looks like
a fire out by Ridgecrest

FRANK
We crashed the X-2

GERSON
My four-million dollar X-2 Is
that the X-2 youre referring to
HAWK
We did break both altitude and
speed records sir And beat
the free fall mark by 30000 feet

Frank glares at Hawk

GERSON
Three planes in ten months Thats
bound to be a record too Hawkins

FRANK
The engine failed The aircraft
went into a flat spin and we
couldnt recover

Gerson nods compassionately No doubt that these two
despise one another

GERSON
(patronizing)
But you made it Thats the
important thing
(glances at his watch)
And you made it just in time
Frank

CUT TO

INT PRESS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Crammed with PRESS people and photographers They snap
away shouting questions to Gerson at the podium flanked
by Team Daedalus Frank Hawk Jerry and Tank who smile
for the cameras Gerson holds up his hand for quiet and
produces an envelope with the Presidential seal

GERSON

Gentlemen I hold in my hand an
announcement from the office of
the President

(reading the

announcement )
The United States continued
involvement in manned space
exploration is hereby assigned
to a new civilian agency The
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration Project Daedalus
is now complete and designated
Mission Accomplished

He folds up the announcement Frank is utterly confused

ANOTHER REPORTER (PRESS)
What about the pilots Whos
gonna be the first American in
space

Gerson turns to Frank smiling He slaps him on the
shoulder

GERSON

The selection has been made
After an exhaustive search we have
identified who could best carry
out this mission

(to the Team)
This job calls for toughness --
physical and mental toughness --
and an ability to follow orders to
the letter

Frank and Hawk exchange glances wondering which it will
be Neither of them notices a sergeant walking in
holding the hand of

SAM
a three-foot chimpanzee wearing a NASA flight suit

GERSON
Gentlemen meet Sam The first
American to cross into outer
space

The chimp grins huge Frank and the Team are open-
mouthed in shock Gerson picks him up smiling for the
photo-op The flashbulbs and questions erupt like a
thunderstorm Sam reaches his hand out to Frank

GERSON
Oh look Frank He wants to
shake your hand

FRANK
You bastard

GERSON
Shake his hand for the cameras
Frank Thats an order
Frank slowly takes the chimps hand looking as though he
might be sick The cameras flash more blinding an
already stunned man

EXT JOHNSON SPACE CENTER (HOUSTON) - DAY

Establishing SUPERIMPOSE THE PRESENT

INT SPACE TRACKING ROOM - DEEP IN COMPLEX - MORNING
If its larger than a basketball and its orbiting the
Earth it is tracked here Pure NASA Hi-Tech all
business

Five engineers sit at computers banging away at their
keyboards in frustration AstronautEngineer ETHAN
GLANCE 34 pushes back from the console Ethan usually
has the clean-cut swagger of an arrogant handsome young
man with too many letters after his name Today
however hes got the dishevelled look of a guy whos
been up all night working

ETHAN
It just isnt responding

The engineer next to Ethan turns to another engineer --
and translates in Russian to her

INT ADMINISTRATIVE WING - CORRIDOR - THAT MOMENT

Engineers and administrators move about focused with a
purpose

INT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The sign on the door identifies this as the office of
SARA HOLLAND Space Shuttle Mission Director Thirty-
seven ex-astronaut focused like a laser beam on
anything she pays attention to

Right now she scans a thick computer printout shaking
her head at whatever its telling her The PHONE RINGS
she grabs it absent- mindedly

SARA
Sara Holland Okay be right
there

INT NASA CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

At the conference table sit Flight Director EUGENE DAVIS
(60s) an avuncular rotund man

Beside him are NASA administrators a couple of STATE
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS orbital engineers Russian
engineers from Star City and the Russian General VOSTOV
(50s)

Sara enters arms full of files and printouts

BOB GERSON now 67 quickly rises to meet her Age has
been kind to the retired General-turned-NASA Project
Director He at least has the appearance of
venerability
GERSON
Gentlemen this is Mission
Director Sara Holland Shes been
closely monitoring the situation
and she assures me the problem is
well in hand

She looks at Gerson skeptically Not the politician
Gerson is she begins her briefing speaking a no-
bullshit scientists lingo colored with a hint of her
Virginia heritage

SARA
Good morning gentlemen As you
know 11 days ago Atmospheric
Tracking determined that Russian
communications satellite Ikon has
initiated orbital degradation
Computer trajectory models predict
a steady acceleration in sequence
with the gravitational constant

STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL
Would you mind translating that
for all the non-PhDs Dr
Holland

SARA
The satellites orbit is decaying
and the Earths gravity is taking
over

Vostov looks particularly agitated

SARA

Theres a total systems failure in
the on-line navigation and
guidance avionics All redundant
systems are non-responsive
Without active course correction
in the next 30 to 40 days the
satellite will reenter the
atmosphere

Gerson looks nervously at Vostov

VOSTOV
And crash

SARA
General Ikon gave you fourteen
years of service That is within
the performance range of a
communications satellite It will
probably crash in the ocean or
burn up in the atmosphere I
think its best to let it
Vostov stands addresses the room conciliatorily

VOSTOV
My country is grateful for the
efforts of NASA and the State
Department However losing Ikon
is not an option Ikon is not
just a communications satellite to
the Russian Federation Ikon is
the communications satellite You
are undoubtedly aware of our
restructuring problems Losing
all telecommunications until we
are able to replace Ikon could
plunge us into chaos and perhaps
even civil war

DAVIS
Certainly you have other
satellites aloft Cant you
transfer the workload

GERSON

Gene Sara we have been given a
Presidential mandate to assist the
Russians

(smiling at Vostov)
Our partners in the
International Space Station

(reassuringly to Vostov)
We will fix this problem Its
just a glitch

CUT TO

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

A clearly pissed off Sara walks briskly behind Gerson
down the hallway

SARA
Youre feeding these guys bold-
faced lies This is a waste of
money and a waste of my staffs
time --

GERSON
Youre a damn fine engineer Sara
but you dont know shit about
politics Helping Russia save
face is an act of good faith You
cant put a price on that

Gerson stops in front of a door and slides his ID key
card through the electronic lock
INT SPACE TRACKING - CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sara and Gerson enter Ethan stares at his computer
monitor exhausted and defeated The Russian engineers
are slumped asleep on couches and at their consoles

ETHAN
This things dumb as a post Its
dead in the air

GERSON
Forget trying to talk to the
satellite You have the code
override the guidance system

Ethan points to four technical drawings pinned to the
wall

ETHAN
You figure that mess out The
guidance system on this thing is a
dinosaur

Sara crosses to the wall analyzes the technical
drawings

ETHAN

(nodding to sleeping

Russians)
Even these guys dont understand
it its pre-microprocessor its
pre-everything Whoever designed
this byzantine piece of shit is
probably chopping rocks in
Siberia

SARA
(still staring at
drawings)
Is there anyone around who
remembers Skylab

GERSON
What does that have to do with
anything

SARA

Youre a damn fine politician
Bob but you dont know shit about
engineering

(turns to face Bob)
This is the guidance system from
Skylab

GERSON
Thats impossible Maybe there
are similarities but they cant
be the same

Sara goes to one of the computers logs on

SARA
Im looking up the designer
GERSON
Dont bother It was Francis D
Corvin
SARA

Is he dead
Gerson closes his eyes in dread

GERSON
Only if Im lucky

CUT TO

EXT RANCH HOUSE (YOUNTVILLE CALIFORNIA) - DAY

Frank Corvins ranch house An old Porsche 356 in the
driveway

INT GARAGE - DOOR OPEN

FRANK CORVIN age 69 has aged well -- strong fit and
tan if a bit weathered He stands on a step ladder
installing an electric garage opener with a cordless
drill Hes losing his patience cussing under and over
his breath as his wife BARBARA an attractive long-gray-
haired woman of 65 refers to --

INSTRUCTIONS

which show the bearded assistant from Home Improvement
grinning as he easily installs the device

BARBARA
Would you like me to read you the
instructions again --

Frank cuts her off with the LOUD CORDLESS DRILL at
maximum revs The final screw screwed in he presses a
button on the unit The garage door goes down smooth
perfect the timed light goes on

FRANK
Let me explain something darlin’

Job done he steps down from the ladder victory on his
face
FRANK
Those instructions are written by
a Japanese fella in Japan where
they make the damn thing Then
they have some expatriated
American living in Japan because
he cant get a job in the US
translate them Then since its
Japan and theyre wary of
foreigners they get a Japanese
fella to edit the American guy who
translated the Japanese guy

He grins smugly takes the instructions from her tears
them in half The timed light clicks off its pitch
black inside the garage We hear him fumble for the
remote and press the button Nothing He presses it
again Nothing

BARBARA
You know the door to the house is
locked right

FRANK
Its just the security code

He pops the back off the remote --

FRANK
Or the battery

BARBARA
You forgot the battery

FRANK
(romantic)
Well looks like its just you and
me in a dark place the smell of
gasoline and fertilizer in the
air

He fumbles about advancing on her The ladder falls
She laughs and screams for help

BARBARA
Help Im locked in a smelly
garage with a dirty old man

He stubs his toe cusses And laughs She gives in
they start to make out The GARAGE DOOR suddenly HUMS to
life and opens casting the daylight on them mid-embrace
revealing --

SARA AND ETHAN

standing in front of Franks Porsche a beige government
sedan behind it Ethan holds an identical remote

ETHAN
Mr Corvin
FRANK
Doctor Corvin
ETHAN
Excuse me -- Doctor Corvin Am I

interrupting something

The question is too stupid to even answer Sara shoots
him a look

SARA
Doctor Corvin Im Sara Holland
and this is Astronaut Ethan Glance
Were with NASA

Frank eyes them suspiciously looking at the remote
control in Ethans hand

ETHAN
It was in your car I heard
someone scream

FRANK
Thanks for saving the day Now
what do you want

ETHAN
Could we have a minute of your
time

FRANK

You should have called first Im
a very busy man

Barbara stifles a giggle Frank sends her a dirty look

SARA
Dr Corvin in thirty-five days a
satellite with your guidance
system on board is going to re-
enter the atmosphere The system
is non-responsive Want to take a
crack at it

CUT TO

INT FRANKS DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ethan has spread the technical drawings on the dining
table They all drink glasses of iced tea Frank slowly
crunches his ice as he studies the drawings This
clearly sends shivers down Ethans spine and Frank knows
it
ETHAN
There seems to be an interruption
in the path here but the
circuitry is still operational
Its sending us data --

FRANK
Youve lost your uplink

ETHAN
It has to be a problem in the
manual routing drive here

FRANK
I dont think so

ETHAN
Thats the consensus among the
engineers

FRANK

The same engineers that sent you
here

He crunches his ice for emphasis Ethan winces

FRANK
Does that bother you

ETHAN
Yes it does actually
Crunch
SARA
Your design pre-dates all existing
guidance systems It was ahead of
its time in 69 but this
technology is obsolete now None
of the current engineers speak
this language and the older guys
are
She trails off the conclusion clear -- theyre all dead

FRANK
It wasnt designed for this
duration of duty It was designed
for SkyLab My advice to you is
capture the satellite and bring it
home

ETHAN
Its too big

FRANK
For the space shuttle What kind

of bird is it

SARA
Its a Russian communications
satellite

FRANK

What the hells my guidance system
doing onboard a Russian satellite

ETHAN
Thats really not our primary
concern at this time

FRANK
(Frank really hates
him now)
Wheres it orbiting or is that
not a primary concern either

SARA
One thousand miles

FRANK
Rate of decay

SARA
8000 meters per day And
accelerating

FRANK
Youre right about one thing that
birds coming home Five weeks at
the most

SARA
NASAs calculations agree But
here we are Doctor you designed
this system If anyone can solve
this its you

Frank chomps his ice sizing up both of them

FRANK
For a moment there I was thinking
you two might be a couple of Bob
Gersons lackeys

FRANK (CONTD)
But judging by your command of the
facts of history I see thats
impossible Hes been taking
credit for that since I worked it
out in 58 the year he replaced
my ass with a monkey

His blood pressures rising He keeps his gaze on Sara
sees she looks uncomfortable

FRANK
You dont work for Bob do you

SARA
Hes a Project Manager at NASA
Hes one of many people assigned
to this problem

Frank nods unmoved

FRANK
Ill have to ask you both to
leave

ETHAN
Dr Corvin your country needs
you

FRANK

Stick a sock in it son Ive
heard it all before You cant
solve this problem from here and
youll never get a crew up to
speed on it in time Your birds
dead let her die My only hope
is that what doesnt disintegrate
during re-entry lands on Bob
Gersons house

Franks rage boils right under the surface Barbara
watches from the kitchen

FRANK
But before you go let me offer
you both some career advice Get
as far from that son of a bitch as
humanly possible

Ethan rolls up the drawing

ETHAN
Apparently the buzz on you is
correct

FRANK

And what buzz is that

ETHAN
Youre not a team player Thats
why you washed out at NASA

FRANK
Get the hell out of my house

Ethan exits hurriedly Sara takes her time Theres
disappointment but respect on her face She exits
Franks face is flushed red his eyes angry slits teeth
clenched

BARBARA
We have to brush up on your
hospitality skills

INT CORVINS KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT
Silence at the dinner table Frank is still seething

BARBARA
You know what the problem with
that satellite is dont you

Frank snorts butters a roll He obviously does

BARBARA
You could fix it Probably ina
day Right

FRANK
I wont crawl back for another
beating Gerson made his bed let
him lie in it Barbara Its an
old satellite a Russian one at
that Itll burn up on re-entry
and theyll build another one

BARBARA
Frank

Barbara watches him leave hates to see him like this

INT FRANKS GARAGE - LATE NIGHT

Frank takes the original drawing of the guidance system
out of a tube and spreads it across his drafting table
He blows the dust off it He studies it casually eating
ice cream

The look on his face tells us the problem is

obvious His eyes travel up to --

GROUP PHOTO ON WALL

a few other guys posing in front of the X-2 jet pre-
crash Full of youthful vigor their dreams still alive
eyes on the prize of space

staring at the picture His eyes are misty its as if
old dreams frozen inside him have begun to thaw Like a
child he licks the vanilla ice cream moustache off his
upper lip

Project Daedalus

Frank Corvin stands at her door wearing his cracked
leather Air Force jacket and jeans chewing gum

FRANK
I have a solution to your problem

CUT TO

INT BOB GERSONS OFFICE - UPSTAIRS

The door opens Gerson looks up sees Sara bring Frank
in covers his disdain with an insincere smile

GERSON
Frank Corvin How longs it been

FRANK
Not long enough Bob

GERSON
(laughs)
Havent lost that Corvin charm
have we Coffee

Frank nods Gerson goes to the credenza and pours a cup

GERSON
Sara tells me youre up to speed
on our little problem Weve got
one sick bird
(pointedly)
Apparently theres a flaw in the
guidance system

He hands Frank his coffee Frank smiles at his jab

FRANK
Thats a helluva way to get the
designer of that system to help
you out

GERSON
Well I heard about your initial

response Dont worry Im sure
well come up with something

SARA
Dr Corvin is here with a
solution

GERSON

Well praise the Lord we are
delivered Lets hear this
solution Frank

Franks delivery is as nonchalant as possible

FRANK
Send my team up Well fix your
broken satellite

Both Gerson and Sara look incredulous An eternity
passes Frank fills the silence with a loud slurp of
coffee

FRANK
You make a damn good cup of
coffee Bob

GERSON
You want to run that by me again

FRANK
Team Daedalus Hawk Tank Jerry
and me Send us up

GERSON
This is a joke right

Frank grins impishly shakes his head no Sara resists
smiling

FRANK
We trained five years for a space
mission

GERSON
How old are you Frank

FRANK
Old enough to know your ass is in
a sling

GERSON

Sara would you excuse us This
is fast becoming a personal
matter

Enjoying this Sara reluctantly exits

FRANK
Youre out of options I know
that because Im the last person
youd come to for help

GERSON
You got that right

FRANK
Your satellite comes down in
thirty-four days Its too big to
retrieve Its too important to
let crash I designed that
guidance system Im the only one
who can fix it

GERSON
I dont know how to break this to
you Frank But youre an old man

FRANK
Well this old mans all you got
You know it I know it Besides
you let Glenn go up at 77 Theres
the offer Ill be hearing from
you

Frank stands turns to leave Gerson shouts after him

GERSON
You became a senior citizen five
years ago

Frank stops turns around with a care-to-differ look

FRANK
Four

GERSON
For once in your life be a team
player Train the crew if you
like but let the professionals at
NASA fix the design flaw

FRANK
(getting angry)
There arent any design flaws
How it ended up in a Russian bird
in the middle of the cold war --
thats the only flaw I see How
did that happen Bob

Gerson squirms

FRANK
This is a hands-on job and
theres no way I can train anyone
in this time-frame My offers on
the table Me and the team Take
it or leave it

He turns to leave again walks to the door

GERSON
You -- as a technical advisor
maybe But I cant fill a space
shuttle with geriatrics Youre
professional enough to know that
Half those guys are probably dead

anyway

Frank opens the door and without looking back walks
out

FRANK (0S)
The clocks ticking Bob And Im
only getting older

INT JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - ENTRY HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Frank strides confidently to the front door Hes chased
by a SECURITY GUARD who grabs him Frank pushes the man
off him and keeps on walking

SECURITY
Mr Gerson would like you to wait
here

Frank stops turns around Gerson exits an elevator and
walks briskly towards him Frank grins confidently
hands in the pockets of his leather flight jacket

GERSON
Alright Its a deal

He sticks out his hand Frank looks at it doesnt take
it

FRANK
I want it in writing

GERSON

Okay But here are the terms
you and every member of your team
has to pass the same physical
requirements as any other
astronaut here If one of you
fails none of you go up

(as Frank thinks

nods )
And just to insure this isnt a
total exercise in futility you
will train to fix that guidance
system side-by-side with my people
in case your men dont pass which

is a distinct possibility

FRANK
Thats fair

GERSON
I cant tell you how much Im
going to enjoy watching you make a
complete ass out of yourself

Frank sticks out his hand and they shake Frank grins

FRANK
(sarcastic)
Its great to be working with you
again Bob

Frank walks off Gerson shakes his head

INT AMERICA BAPTIST CHURCH (OKLAHOMA CITY) - SUNDAY
MORNING

The Reverend Sullivan (Tank) pauses in his sermon --
puzzling over his notes A youngish 67 his flowing
robes cant hide his barrel-chest and Air Force tattoo on
his wrist of a winged skull with a bloody dagger between
its teeth Tank is thoroughly lost desperately trying
to find his place pages falling off the lectern

TANK
Romans uh Chronicles ah
yes

The sparse congregation waits in catatonic silence An
old man drool on his chin jolts awake from his wifes
elbow in his ribs Sitting in the back of the church is
Frank barely containing his laughter at Tanks
awkwardness in the pulpit

TANK
‘And in the fortieth year Amariah
begat Zadok who begat Libni the
brother of Uzziah No thats
not it either

Sighs from the congregation Tanks losing them He
looks down at the face of the lectern at --

The hula girl we saw in his B-50 in 58 Keeps it there
for good luck and for moments like these

TANK
Once upon a time four of the best
pilots in the Air Force trained to
fly into space They flew at the
speed of sound to the very top of
the sky cheating death as they
freefall from twenty miles high

The church is waking up now -- they apparently love these
old war stories from Reverend Tank

INT BACK OF CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

The recessional music thunders as the congregation
Frank waits smiling at the end of the

dismisses

receiving line

bear hug

INT TANK

Pilot pictures among the seminary books

TANK

(looks up to the
heavens )
Sorry My former boss

FRANK
I bring glad tidings Reverend
Tank They go by the name of
Daedalus There appears to be a
resurrection after all

S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

up and takes down a photo of Team Daedalus

shaking his head in disbelief

TANK
I dont know Frank Thats a

complicated proposition I have a

flock I have grandchildren

FRANK
Theyll be here when you get back
Besides youre bound to be able
to milk this for three or four
sermons

TANK
I need to pray about this

FRANK
Can you pray quick

TANK
Wait wait a moment my stiff-
necked brother
(closes his eyes
swoons )
I am receiving a word from on
High

Tank sees him and grabs him up in a

Frank reaches

Tank removes

EXT AMUSEMENT PARK (CALIFORNIA) - DAY

The park is under construction empty except for cranes
and crews assembling roller coasters One of the roller
coasters is completely built and a single car rides
around the track

INT ROLLER COASTER CAR

Riding alone in the car is Jerry ONeill Slight of
build a few wrinkles a bad jet-black toupee under his
baseball cap at 68 he has become a swinging bachelor out
of touch with the times He grins ear to ear as he talks
into a micro-cassette recorder

JERRY
Lets kick this apogee up about 15
percent -- whoaa Second banks

too fast some little Johnnys
gonna pass out on us drop ita
G going into third loop

(going upside down)
Little more of a sine wave feel
here not so flat

Standing at the bottom of the roller coaster are several
technicians and a PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN about thirty
watching Jerry smiling Frank walks up to her as he
watches Jerry go around He seems to know her

FRANK

Thirty-five years designing
supersonic aircraft for the
military Now hes building
roller coasters Perfect

(laughs at the

irony)
Your fathers a gifted man

The Young Woman looks at Frank doesnt recognize him

PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN
Oh hes gifted alright

The roller coaster come in Jerry gets out and hugs the

Young Woman gives her a prolonged kiss that is anything
but paternal He sees Frank laughing to himself

JERRY
Frank Corvin What are you doing
here

FRANK

Just wondering if youre busy for
the next month and a half

Jerry tosses his tape recorder to one of the technicians

FRANK
NASA wants to send us into space

Jerry examines Frank leaning in and tilting his head
like Frank is crazy He looks concerned

JERRY

I wondered whod be the first
Forty-year-old memories are sharp
as the day they happened but you
cant for the life of you remember
what you had for breakfast

(pauses loudly)
What did you have for breakfast
Frank

FRANK
Vegetarian huevos rancheros and
some kind of flavored decaf
cappuccino that tasted like it was
filtered through a jock strap

Jerry smiles -- his old friend is okay

JERRY
Frank

Frank proudly shows a copy of the NASA contract to Jerry
Jerry takes out a pair of very thick-lensed glasses (80s
Porsche frames) and puts them on Franks look of pride

turns to one of worry as he sees Jerrys thick glasses

FRANK
You need those

JERRY
(without irony)
Naah Theyre just for reading
driving seeing movies
walking
(at the contract)
Frank how on earth --

FRANK
Are you in
JERRY
Hell yes Im in

Jerry hugs Frank slaps his back

JERRY
Team Daedalus rides again Hawk
mustve gone into orbit when you
told him

FRANK
I havent talked to him yet I
havent talked to him in a while
Jerry

JERRY
When are you guys gonna grow up
and stop acting like little boys

EXT UTAH AIRFIELD —- DAY

Various aircraft ring a Quonset Hut next to this dirt
field The place houses a couple of flying schools a
crop-dusting outfit and an Air Tours service The YOUNG
PILOTS inside the hut are all 30-ish fresh out of the
military almost too serious about their work

An antsy kid named JASON enters excitedly with his
girlfriend

JASON
Its my birthday I want the shit
scared outta me You know barrel
rolls loopdeloops all that
stuff

YOUNG PILOT
We dont do that kind of flying
Its dangerous and irresponsible

PILOT 2
Too many lawsuits

Jasons face falls

JASON
Well who does

The Young Pilot thinks then points to the side of the
Quonset Hut which is open

YOUNG PILOT
He does

Hawk now in his mid-sixties sits unassumingly ina
corroded aluminum fold-up chair feet up on a cooler
reading a fishing magazine
YOUNG PILOT
Hey Hawk this guy wants a scary
ride

Hawk looks up calmly eyes Jason who bounces on the balls
of his feet in anticipation

JASON
Its my birthday

HAWK
Well happy birthday

A P-51 Mustang does a 450 mph barrel roll 100 feet off
the deck

INT P- MUSTANG - THAT MOMENT

In the back seat Jason hangs on for dear life

HAWK
All right lets go upstairs

The P-51s nose pulls straight up and theyre in a 6-G
climb

JASON
Oh God
HAWK
Here comes the fun part -- were

going weightless

JASON
I dont think thats such a good
idea

HAWK

Aw youll love it

10000 feet up The P-51 reaches its apogee and gently
noses over her MOTOR WHINING down As they go over the
top they go weightless

JASON
Oh God
HAWK
This is what flyings all about

Jason doesnt seem to agree Hes fully green and gags

JASON
Ive had enough sir
HAWK
You sure You got ten minutes

left

(as Jason nods

and groans)
Whatever Its your money

He throws the stick over and Jason screams for his life
as the plane plunges earthward

EXT NEARBY ROAD - DRIVING - THAT MOMENT

THROUGH the windshield of his rental car Frank watches
the plane as it does a twisting rolling free fall --
straight down He recognizes Hawks signature flying
style laughs

INT P- MUSTANG - THAT MOMENT

Hawk pulls out of the dive 100 feet off the deck again
pulling a snap-turn as he lines it up for the runway
Jason loses his lunch

EXT TAXIWAY - THAT MOMENT

The P-51 gracefully hits the tarmac and rolls to a stop
Hawk CUTS the ENGINE popping the canopy

Jason pours himself out wobbly-kneed Hawk annoyed
helps the humiliated still-green Jason out Vomit is
splattered all over the back seat

HAWK
Who gave you the bright idea to
eat a big lunch before going up

JASON
Oh my God Im so sorry Ill
clean it up sir

Hawk reaches into the cockpit and pulls out a towel Out
of the corner of his eye Hawk sees Jasons girlfriend
bounding towards them from across the tarmac Jason
doesnt

HAWK
Dont worry about it Ill do it

(loudly so girlfriend
hears)
You earned your wings today Hot
Shot I give

Hawk musters up a wink and a smile that fades the second
Jason steps down to hug his girl Hawk turns and wearily
begins cleaning out the cockpit

In the bg Franks rental car pulls up Frank gets
out but Hawk doesnt immediately see him

FRANK
Hey

Hawk looks up no visible reaction

HAWK
Hey

Frank walks closer A long beat passes

FRANK
You know what the worst day in my
life was

HAWK

FRANK
The day Armstrong set foot on the
moon I think I mustve been the
only person in the world who
wanted to kill myself that day

HAWK
Thanks for that Frank We
havent talked in 12 years and
that was pretty much the big
question on my mind What are you
doing here

Frank grins mischievously Hes been looking forward to
this

FRANK
Keeping a promise A promise I
made 40 years ago

HAWK
The one where you were going to
kill me on sight or just have my
legs broken

FRANK
(smiles remembering)
The other one Ive engaged ina
little blackmail with NASA

Theyve got a satellite thats
gonna crash unless they find a way
to fix the guidance system

HAWK
Im guessing you designed the
guidance system

FRANK
(nods grins)
Theyre desperate Bob Gerson
came begging to me for help I
told him Id fix it but only if
he sends up the original Daedalus
team to do the job

Frank shows him the contract Hawk studies it

FRANK
Its no joke Hawk Jerry and
Tank are in theyre waiting for
us at that roadhouse off the
highway

HAWK
You know age just brings out more
of the Frank in you Frank I am
genuinely impressed

Hawk laughs Frank laughs the two men laugh together --
this seems to be going well

Hawk carefully folds up the contract and hands it back to
Frank

HAWK
Dont put foolish dreams in a
fools head Especially not an
old fool Have a nice flight
Frank

Hawk goes back to the P-51s engine
FRANK
You werent a fool then But

youre being one now

HAWK
Say hello to Barbara for me

Frank stares at him angrily his temper rising

FRANK
Sure Say hello to Jackie for me

HAWK
Wish I could Frank Wish I
could

Frank freezes unaware that Hawks wife had died

FRANK
Im sorry I didnt know

Hawk ignores him continues checking the plugs

INT RENTAL CAR (HIGHWAY) - MOMENTS LATER

He curses to himself as he drives along the highway An
old pick-up truck passes him on the left lane nearly
going headfirst into an oncoming eighteen-wheeler At
the last minute the pick-up quickly cuts in front of
Frank kicking up a cloud of dust and exhaust in his face
and tearing off Frank angrily HONKS the HORN

CUT TO

EXT ROADHOUSE (EDGE OF HIGHWAY) - DAY

Franks car pulls up and parks He gets out and walks to
the front door He notices the pickup truck that just
cut him off parked in the lot and glares at it Jerry
and Tank open the screen door stand in the doorway

They see the pissed-off look on Franks face

JERRY
He said no huh

FRANK
Lets get the hell out of here

TANK
Maybe we should talk to him

FRANK
Forget it Hes still the same
stubborn thick-skulled jackass he
always was

Hawk who has been sitting at the bar turns around on
his stool and finishes a beer He smiles at Frank

HAWK
And you still drive slower than a
little old lady going to church

A smile slowly ripples along Franks face A DRUM ROLL
and PATRIOTIC MUSIC

CUT TO

EXT JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - DAY
The four men of Team Daedalus all wearing their cracked
leather flight jackets stride towards the mammoth NASA
Headquarters awed and dwarfed by its sheer size The
steps falter just a bit the men wondering what theyve
gotten themselves into They reach the giant front doors
of the --

EXT ADMINISTRATIVE HEADQUARTERS

The twin glass doors open automatically Frank enters
Hawk enters Jerry enters Tank hesitates The biggest
and toughest-looking of the bunch turns tail and starts
to trot off when Frank grabs him and pulls him inside

INT COMPLEX - VARIOUS SHOTS

Our four heroes strut down corridor after windowless
corridor of the interconnected buildings Glances are
exchanged between them and the younger men and women who
make up NASA The atmosphere is clinical antiseptic
anti-heroic and the people who work here are of the MIT-
physicist-in-space mold The two groups are a vivid
contrast

More corridors And more corridors This place goes on
forever Jerry and Tank are getting a little winded
Tank exhausted sits down Frank grabs his arm and
yanks him back up

DISSOLVE TO

INT EQUIPMENT TEST ROOM - DAY

A tireless hyperactive seven-year-old boy named ANDREW
runs in tight circles doing airplanes while making
sound effects

This room is set up for tours and class trips space
suits and tools are on display Sara talks to a group of
kids age six to ten and their TEACHER Sara obviously
loves being around kids

Sara steps into a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) supported
by a stand wired up to a treadmill The MMU looks like
a giant chair-back with tiny jet nozzles and canisters of
nitrogen gas

SARA
This is an MMU That stands for
Manned Maneuvering Unit The
MMU allows our astronauts to
move around in space so they can
do work outside the space shuttle

Frank Hawk Jerry and Tank enter the room Sara smiles

at Frank The boy doing airplanes flies right into
Tanks abdomen Tank buckles over in pain The kid
ricochets off him into Hawk

TANK
Ooof

TEACHER
Andrew

Hawk catches the kid and lifts him up

SARA
Come here Andrew Lets have
some fun

She lowers the MMU down to him and straps him in She
starts the treadmill Andrew excitedly swivels the
joysticks on the MMUs armrest controls Gas sprays out
from different nozzles on the MMU

SARA
Just one little burst from these
jets is enough to move the
astronaut miles in space

ANDREW
How come Im not going anywhere

SARA
Because were on Earth and thats
a very heavy unit In space you
dont weigh anything Theres no
gravity and theres no air
resistance

The kids look fascinated but confused Hawk holds his
hand out moves it up and down

HAWK
Like when you stick your hand
outside the car window and the air
moves it up and down Thats air
resistance

SARA
(smiles at him)
Right In space that wouldnt
happen

LITTLE GIRL
So if I jumped on a trampoline in
space

SARA
Youd go up and up and youd
never come down
The kids giggle loving this Frank Hawk Tank and
Jerry look as awestruck and thrilled as the kids

ANDREW
Could you hit a baseball to the
moon

SARA

Actually you could All youd
have to do is knock it halfway
there about a hundred thousand
miles and the moons gravity
would do the rest

Hawk contemplates this The teacher of the class herds
the kids out of the room leaving just Sara Frank Hawk
Tank and Jerry

SARA
Ive never met a kid who didnt
dream of being an astronaut when
he grew up

Hawk throws his arm over Franks shoulder

HAWK
Ever met a kid who wouldnt let
the dream go

FRANK
Sara Holland this is Colonel
William Hawk Hawkins Retired
Air Force in 1990 Still the best
pilot they ever had -- not
counting me that is

HAWK
Maam

He shakes her hand Their eyes connect with a spark

SARA
The Hawk Ive heard of you
Commander Cliff Jenkins once told
me a story about you and him in
Viet Nam

HAWK
It if came out of Cliffs mouth I
guarantee its 100 percent
bullshit
(laughs)
How is the old bullshitter

SARA
Hes dead actually

Hawks smile freezes Frank turns to Tank
FRANK
While Hawk chews on his boot
well move right along Captain
Tank Sullivan The best
navigator the Air Force ever had
could find anything anywhere
That is before God got him

TANK
Now more than ever Pleased to
meet you Miss Holland

FRANK
And last but not least Captain
Jerry ONeill Structural
Engineer and designer The
Stealth Fighter is his drawing
come to life

SARA
You dont have a nickname

JERRY
(kisses her hand)
You can call me ‘anytime

Big laugh Frank rolls his eyes

SARA
O-kay Well if you men are
ready we have some work to do

INT GERSONS OFFICE - DAY
Gerson is alone with Vostov who is pacing nervously

VOSTOV
I dont need to remind you of the
consequences of failure here --
personal consequences

GERSON
Thats the problem with you
Russians the glass is always half
empty

VOSTOV
These men you are sending up they
are not astronauts The last time
they trained for a space mission
people were driving cars with fins
on them

Gerson laughs
GERSON
Colonel Corvin isnt going
anywhere His team wont pass the
physical trials

VOSTOV
This is supposed to reassure me
What will you do then

GERSON
My best young astronaut is
training alongside Colonel Corvin
gaining proficiency in this
antiquated guidance system of his
Until he does Corvin is to
believe hes going up

VOSTOV
(panicky)
I dont know perhaps we should
consult --

GERSON
There will be no consulting No
one is to be in the loop on our
problem Are we clear on that
General

CUT TO

INT OPERATIONS BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

Crowded room filled with technicians operations people
engineers back-up astronauts Gerson and Vostov

On the side wall stands Ethan and his team of astronauts
three men two women and they dont look too happy

Most pissed among them is astronaut ROGER HINES 35 an
athletic black man with a lot of attitude The room goes
quiet when Gerson and Sara bring in Frank Hawk Jerry
and Tank

SARA
Good morning all Welcome to
the STS-200 OPS overview briefing

All have NASA 3-ring binders STS-200 Thats the cue to
open

SARA
This is a rather unusual mission
I think wed all agree Well get
started on the particulars here in
a moment but first Id like us to
make welcome the astronauts
selected for this mission the

founding members of Project
Daedalus

Polite applause Roger Hines glare is withering

SARA
As all of you know these men are
the pioneers of this business
They were around when rockets
were born

SARA (CONTD)
(smile)
Welcome gentlemen This is your
team now

The door opens and Flight Director Eugene Davis enters

SARA

STS-200 was originally slated to
deliver a structural payload to
the international space station
Circumstances have forced us to
push back that mission and
undertake an emergency rescue
operation Our average staging
time for a mission is 12 months
Were doing this one in 32 days

(to Team Daedalus)
The flight crew you are replacing
is one of NASAs best

ANGLE ON ETHAN ROGER AND YOUNG TEAM

SARA
You will train right alongside
them in the interest of speed
Colonel Hawkins you will be
piloting the newest shuttle in our
fleet This is her maiden flight

Hawk looks at Frank with a devilish grin whispers to
him

HAWK
You know how much I love flying a
virgin

SARA

You were the finest America had to
offer once Ive no doubts you
still are

Sara signals someone in the back and the lights dim A
3-D map of Earth appears on a video screen Jerry puts
his glasses on Frank reaches over and takes them off
SARA
In 1986 the former Soviet Union
launched communications satellite
Ikon into orbit Ikon is an
irreplaceable link in Russias
telecommunications chain

The graphic changes to a satellite with large solar
panels

SARA
Her orbit is decaying rapidly
She will enter our atmosphere in
30 days Your mission is to
intercept and capture Ikon using
the shuttles grappling arm You
will then have a 42-hour window in
which to repair the guidance
system From there Ikon will be
reconfigured from Mission Control
Once accomplished you will return
her to geo-sync orbit using the
Payload Assist Module rockets

The lights come up Eugene Davis raises his hand

DAVIS

Question

(glances uneasily at

Frank)
With all due respect to Frank --
why dont we just capture the bird
and bring her home with a team
trained in satellite retrieval

Its clear that this is this question everyone here is
wondering

GERSON
Its too big Gene

DAVIS
For the space shuttle
(to Vostov)
How did you guys get it up there

VOSTOV
There were modifications post-
deployment

GERSON

The system has to be fixed on-
site Given the short time line
Frank the only engineer
proficient in such obsolete
technology is the only engineer
who can do the job
Davis is not convinced Neither is Roger

INT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE BRIEFING ROOM - MOMENT LATER

Davis waits impatiently for astronauts techs and Vostov
to clear the hall before he dive-bombs Gerson Sara and
Frank

DAVIS
So Frank Corvins taking his band
of Leisure World Aviators for a
ride into space NASA agreed to
this The Russians agreed to it

GERSON
Frank has left us little choice in
the matter

Frank grins Davis smiles cynically

DAVIS
I figured it might be something
along those lines You two hate
each other too much to cook this
up together

No reply its obviously true The smile fades

DAVIS
I dont want any part of it Get
yourself another flight director

He turns to walk away stops and turns around

DAVIS
By the way how did the guidance
system from SkyLab end up on a
Russian Bird

FRANK
Damned if I know But I seem to
be the only one able to fix it

DAVIS
Grow up Frank Be a team player
Help my astronauts out -- as an
engineer

FRANK

If I werent completely confident
that I could deliver every bit as
well as your astronauts I
wouldnt go near it

Davis waits then lets out a soft rolling laugh from his
chest

DAVIS
You havent changed a bit

FRANK
That seems to be the consensus

DAVIS
(to Gerson)
Im still the flight director and
I can pull the plug on this one

Frank smirks

DAVIS
You guys made a deal fine But
heres my deal Im not turning
over a brand new shuttle to four
rookies with a months training
Youre taking two of my guys with
you

(off Franks wince)
Ethans a brown-nosing brat
Rogers a cocky little shit but
theyre the best astronauts in our
pipeline Theyre on board or
this flight stays on the pad

FRANK
Okay Gene

DAVIS
And if I sense for one second that
you guys arent cutting it
physically or mentally youre off
and the original team flies So
lets see if youve still got it

Tank looks at his height lets out a big laugh turns to
the straight-faced medical technician

TANK

your calibration is off This
says Ive shrunk an inch

He laughs expecting the others to laugh with him They
dont they just stare at him with pity He gets the
hint stops laughing stands as straight as he can

INT CARDIO CENTER - LATER

Hawk Frank Jerry and Tank stand on treadmills
stationary An annoying CARDIO TECH applies EKG tabs on
to our bare-chested men connecting them to EKG monitors
The tech talks to them like they are deaf old men
enunciating very loudly

CARDIO TECH
Im going to start you off very
very slow

He points to a large red button on each treadmill

CARDIO TECH
If at any time you feel dizzy or
weak just hit the red button near
your right hand That will stop
the treadmill

He starts the treadmills slower even than a walking
speed

CARDIO TECH
Hows everybody feeling

Annoyed apparently

HAWK
(sarcastic)
Maybe you could talk a little
louder

CARDIO TECH
Is that speed okay

HAWK
No Its not

Hawk presses a button on the treadmill that increases the
speed of his treadmill so hes moving at a jogging pace
The others follow suit The men get down to some serious
exercise Cardio Tech can tell hes not wanted leaves

Not crazy about needles

DR CARUTHERS
Thats very common When was your

Hawks smile freezes again She finishes smiling
sadly And walks off with the blood Frank and Hawk get

This is gonna give me a heart
attack

HAWK
Thats the idea Tank

TANK
What -- to give us heart attacks
HAWK
Exactly Imagine if we didnt
make it through lift-off The
US would be the first nation to
launch four corpses into orbit

Hawk

ROGER
Can you handle 225 pounds
Colonel

HAWK
Sure

Hawk nervously turns to Tank

HAWK
Spot me

Spot the hell out of me

Hawk slides onto the bench under the barbells Tank
rests his hands under the bar spotting Hawk Hawk

grunts as he pushes the barbell up Roger and Ethan
dont realize --

TANK

isnt just spotting hes helping Hawk by lifting The
exertion shows in his clenched jaw and the bulging vein
in his neck -- he is straining not to grunt must find a
way to camouflage his exertion He yells at Hawk like a
drill sergeant

TANK
PUSH IT COME ON HAWK PUSH
PUSH

Hawk (and Tank) successfully lift the barbell five times
Roger and Ethan are none the wiser look impressed Tank
is suffering Tank finally lets the weight drop back
onto the rack Hawk slides out Easy

ETHAN
Not bad

Roger looks at Tank sees his face is red from exertion

ROGER
Man you really get into it dont

his life no one ever had a
conversation with him that did not

center on his gout his arthritis
or his bowel movements

I am beginning to see the world
through Uncle Wendells eyes

FRANK

Were almost done with the tough
stuff and you want to quit

Hawk and Frank still jogging around the track Sweaty
but looking strong
HAWK

Hawk bursts forward Frank right after him two old men
racing like schoolboys

LONG SHOT - HAWK AND FRANK

running neck and neck the sun coming up behind them
The grounds sprinklers burst on

IN PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT

Sara gets out of her car walks briskly to the
administrative offices all business until she sees --
FRANK AND HAWK

finish the race in a tie then fall on the grass

exhausted They sprawl on their backs underneath the
sprinklers to cool off

SARA

smiles to herself as she watches A new feeling is
coming over NASA

INT GYM - OUTSIDE MENS LOCKERDRESSING ROOM - MORNING

Sara holding a manila envelope tentatively walks up to
the mens locker room door She listens to FRANK AND
HAWK TALKING from inside The door suddenly opens
surprising Sara Frank steps out fully dressed looks
at the embarrassed Sara with a smile She gathers her
wits

SARA
Hi Frank Im looking for Hawk

FRANK
Hes inside You can go on in

SARA
Is it okay

FRANK
(with a twinkle in
his eye)
Oh yeah

He walks off Sara enters the locker room

INT MENS LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Sara enters looking around hears Hawk humming

She passes a row of lockers looks behind it (we dont
see what she sees) -- and instantly turns on her feet and
walks back to the door her face beet red

SARA
I am so sorry

Hawk comes out from behind the lockers towel wrapped
around his waist

HAWK
Its okay its okay
(as she stops)
So What brings you to the
mens locker room Sara

SARA
(difficulty
concentrating)
Gene moved up -- he moved up the
simulator run

She trails off nodding Hawk looks at her waiting for
her to finish

HAWK
To when

SARA
Right That would be eleven
oclock There are some new
procedures I wanted you to be
aware of

She hands him the manila envelope Hawk opens it and
takes out several pages which he carefully reviews
totally nonplussed by the situation After a long
awkward beat Hawk stares at her and smiles She
returns the smile weakly

SARA
This is extremely uncomfortable
Im going to leave now

Hawk gestures grandly to the door He smiles watching
as she hurries off
HAWK
Hey Sara Im taking you out for
a beer

SARA

(to herself)
Im going to need one

CUT TO

INT SHUTTLE SIMULATOR - MORNING

It is a full-scale mock-up of the space shuttle Tank
sits in the payload area holding the grappling arm
control joy stick in his hand He faces a monitor
showing a simulated satellite in space Six stoic
engineers in white coats watch him as he tries to capture
the satellite with the grappling arm He looks disturbed
that he is being observed so closely

TANK
Youre making me nervous

A FEMALE ENGINEER leans forward and whispers in Tanks
ear

FEMALE ENGINEER
You should probably get used to
it Theres going to be a lot

more people watching you on
television

He gulps misses the satellite

INT CLINIC - ON FOUR TEST TUBES - MORNING

of blood in a stand

Dr Caruthers takes a drop of blood from one of the tubes
and sandwiches it between two slides She examines it
under the microscope focuses She looks concerned She
takes one of the test tubes out of the rack and puts it
in --

BLOOD CENTRIFUGE

She turns the centrifuge on and the test tube goes
whipping around and around

MATCH CUT TO

INT CENTRIFUGE ROOM - DAY

The massive arm swinging around the circular room slows
to a stop Two TECHS pop open the clear canopy and
unfasten Jerry and Tank from the two seats Theyre a
little shaky as they exit the cockpit

TECH
That was three Gs Thats as
bad as it gets during ascent and
entry

TANK
Im so pleased

Hawk and Frank are up now They eagerly jump inside the
cockpit and get strapped down hooking up their
headsets The canopy closes over their heads

HAWK
First one to pass out buys the
beers tonight

FRANK
Youre on

Frank grabs the joystick and off they go whipping around
1G 2 Gs They reach 5 Gs in no time

HAWK

Hey Frank did we start yet

FRANK
(into communicator)
I dont know feels like were
standing still

INT CONTROL ROOM - THAT MOMENT

The Engineers look aghast as the boys crank it up some
more Other crew people enter the room including Roger
and members of the young team

HAWK (VO)

monitor)
Whats the matter is the damn
thing broken

This is a spectator event now Theyre up to 8 Gs The
room shakes

TIGHT ON HAWK AND FRANKS FACES

shaking and warping out like the science book pictures

FRANK
(really shaky)
Hey Hawk Im pretty sure the
machine just kicked in

Hawk cranks it up some more And some more This is
getting serious

HAWK AND FRANK

first

but neither will say uncle

HAWK
Yyyyoure e-e-easy
Fffrankkkk

10 Gs The MACHINE is SCREAMING The room is silent

ROGER
Theyre gonna kill themselves

DAVIS (0S)
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON IN
HERE

Everyone turns around Davis at the back of the room

steps forward and slams the all stop switch The arm

slowly winds down Everybody is totally busted -- young
and old alike -- just by being here

The arm stops but we dont see anything through the
canopy from inside the booth Davis is seething -- grabs
the intercom microphone

DAVIS
Im sure this was a great show
But this thing is not a toy
(into the intercom)
One of you idiots care to explain
this

ANGLE ON CENTRIFUGE COCKPIT

As the Tech lifts the canopy we see that Frank and Hawk
have both passed out With their flush red faces drool
at the corner of their mouths and their sweaty hair
they look like sleeping babies strapped into car seats
The Tech takes their pulse They groggily start to
regain consciousness

TECH
Theyre just unconscious sir

Davis fights it but his scowl gives way to a smirk
then a smile The entire room looks relieved

DAVIS
Im getting too old for this shit

INT HONKY-TONK - NIGHT

The place is crowded with young professionals at happy
hour Hawk and Frank shoot pool On the dance floor a
small group of pretty young women led by Jerry are line
dancing

Tank stands alone drinking a beer looking around the
room He sees something that draws him like a bug to a
light --

An arcade game -- the kind where a joy stick operated
claw-on-a-crane drops down and picks up a stuffed animal
inside a glass booth

Tank beelines towards the game and drops in two quarters
He swigs the last of his drink then takes the joy stick

TANK
Purple tiger

The crane comes to life as Tank maneuvers the joy stick
left and right It drops over a little stuffed purple
tiger Tank gingerly clamps on and guides it over the
chute dropping it Tank joyfully retrieves his little
stuffed animal and starts laughing goofily He looks
around the room to see if anyone saw his victory No one
did He stops laughing and stuffs it in his pocket

OVER AT HAWK AND FRANKS POOL TABLE

The pretty young COCKTAIL WAITRESS brings over two
bottles of beer She puts them on a narrow counter near
the pool table

COCKTAIL WAITRESS
Thatll be seven dollars

Frank and Hawk just look at each other a stand-off --
neither goes for their wallet

COCKTAIL WAITRESS
Hello

HAWK
Hes buying

FRANK
Oh no We passed out at the same
time
HAWK
Bullshit I watched you pass out
(beat)
Right before I passed out

They crack up Hawk reaches for his wallet

HAWK
I got this round Only because
Im so confident in my superiority
to you in every aspect of human
life

Frank stops Hawk from paying

FRANK

Maybe theres a way to settle
this

(turns to the

Waitress)
Given the choice which one of us
would you take home with you
tonight

She plays along looking them over

COCKTAIL WAITRESS
You mean like to the home
Like the retirement home

Onlookers laugh All except a big tough man named TINY

HAWK
No seriously Would you choose
this man with his asymmetrical
sagging ass cheeks love handles
the size of Nebraska and yellow
ingrown toenails

FRANK
Or this man with the chicken-
gizzard neck and the face that
looks like a Death Valley fire
road

The womans charmed Shes about to answer when Tiny
intercedes

TINY
Stop harassing the waitress

FRANK
Im not harassing anyone I was
asking her a harmless question
one thats got nothing to do with
you So go back to nursing your
virgin peach daiquiri and mind
your own damn business

TINY
It is my business This womans
my friend and she puts up with
assholes like you all day because

COCKTAIL WAITRESS

Hawk mouths to Frank in disbelief Tiny
TINY

HAWK

Onlookers laugh The man isnt pleased

TINY
I could put you in a hospital old
man
FRANK
Ive got Medicare Take your best
shot
More laughter
TINY
I dont want to make your old lady

a widow

This overheats Franks core Frank drops the charm his
temper flares He grabs Tiny and shoves him against the
counter

FRANK
What did you say

Tiny pushes Frank off him gets in fighting stance
Frank rips his leather jacket off pulls up his sleeves
Hawk has obviously seen this happen before rolls his
eyes as he steps between the two men and addresses
Franks opponent

HAWK
Excuse me a minute
(to Frank)

Listen Frank You cant do this
Were going up into space in 25
days

Hawk speaks loudly enough that the crowd around them
hears their conversation about going into space They

seem like loons

The crowd includes one man drinking at the bar with a
camera bag and notebook

HAWK
If you hurt yourself if you break
a bone or sprain an ankle your
seat on the shuttle is going to
that MIT weenie with the blow-
dried hair And we all watch it
on TV at your house

FRANK
Who said Im gonna hurt myself

TINY
What the hell are you two talking
about -- the space shuttle

Hawk holds up his finger to Tiny for more time

HAWK
Youre going to blow it for us
again arent you You and that
mean-assed temper of yours

FRANK
You still think I blew our shot in
58

HAWK

Face it already Frank You did

Tiny loses interest in fighting Frank This suits Frank
fine -- Hawk is now the subject of his wrath Tank and
Jerry watch from the sidelines smiling

JERRY
Here we go again

Frank shoves Hawk Hawk retreats not wanting to fight

FRANK
And the pilot who wrecked every
rocket and experimental jet the
Air Force gave us

Frank shoves Hawk again Hawk let the first one slide
but not this one He pushes Frank back grabs Franks
jacket off the pool table and throws it in his face
Frank catches it

HAWK
Lets take it outside Im gonna
kick your asymmetrical sagging
ass

Hawk and Frank storm out of the bar Bar patrons watch
the two men like they are crazy All except the man at
the bar with the camera bag who scribbles something in
his notebook

OUTSIDE HONKY-TONK

Hawk and Frank step out the swinging doors into the
parking lot Frank seething Hawk laughing

HAWK
Howd you like that Can I still
get you out of a jam or what You

Crack Frank punches him hard in the jaw Hawk hits the
pavement rubbing his jaw realizing Frank wasnt in on
the plan

FRANK
Whose fault was it that Daedalus
got canned Colonel Hawkins

HAWK

night

Hawk gets up punches Frank in the face The two go at

and weaving neither one relenting

his beer

SARA
Forty percent

HAWK
Forty percent Thats the best
youll give me

SARA
(grinning seductively)
You might nail it You might
crash and burn The odds are
against you Colonel

With a twinkly smile he puts the beer bottle on the
hood and turns to her looking like hes about to make a
move on her Instead he bends down and picks up a rock
off the ground and lets it fly hitting a telephone pole
a hundred feet away

HAWK
(mockingly)
Forty percent

SARA
The wind was with you

HAWK
The wind

She laughs and hands him his beer

SARA

Forty percent for you you nail it
Forty for me I wouldve missed by
a mile

(sips her beer)
Thats why I moved out of the
astronaut program The odds of me
getting on a shuttle were nowhere
near forty percent But I was an
astronaut Yes I was

HAWK
Damn right you were

They clink bottles then toast the moon

SARA
You dont think like that do you
You jumped out of planes twenty
miles up drove rocket sleds the
speed of sound -- youre not afraid

of anything

HAWK
No thats not true Ive been
afraid

breath)
Well I did a better tackle on
that outhouse than hed ever done

funny guys

SARA
What did you do

HAWK

Ran like hell joined the Air
Force the next morning

You were afraid Scott LeBeau was

gonna kick your ass

HAWK
Hell no I was afraid of her

Laughing they stare into each others eyes After an
awkward pause she makes the move kissing him

Hes enjoying the kiss but something is wrong He
kindly withdraws from the kiss then hugs her Sara

on the video screen looking frustrated

FRANK
The lead is connected here across

Youre a genius Frank

Frank gives the divers a thumbs up Frank Jerry and
Tank are lifted out of the water by cranes Once out
techs help them removes their helmets Ethan walks over

ETHAN
So the relay patch is the key

FRANK
Plain as the nose on your face

ETHAN
How did you by-pass the heat
exchanger

FRANK

I didnt by-pass anything

ETHAN
Youre not being very forthcoming
on the workings of the guidance
system --

FRANK
Ive tried everything short of
calculus lessons to get you to
understand this thing What do
you want me to do -- draw you a
picture connect the dots for you

ETHAN
Excuse me I hold two Masters
Degrees from MIT Dr Corvin

FRANK
Id get my money back

JERRY
Ethan youve been trained on a
different set of technologies
Thats all

ETHAN
(ignoring Jerry to

Youre compromising this mission
Im your backup I am on a need-
to-know basis

FRANK
You dont need-to-know shit And
I dont need a backup

Frank bursts into the room pointing a finger at Gerson

FRANK
Youre setting me up again

GERSON
Heres one of our astronauts now
Frank what a semi-pleasant
surprise

FRANK
You sonofabitch You had no
intention of sending me up

GERSON
Frank Im in the middle of
something just now

Frank angrily slams Gersons laptop shut terminating the
call Gerson smiles smugly

GERSON
You just hung up on the head of
our program the Vice President
So what can I do for you Frank

Frank quakes with anger Red-faced snorting loudly

FRANK
You had no intention of sending me
up did you You screwed me over
in 58 and youre screwing me over

now --
GERSON
Screwed you over --
FRANK

You lied to me again How could I
be so stupid as to make a deal
with a chronic liar

GERSON
Deal Frank You blackmailed me
I didnt make any deal with you
But whatever you want to call it
-- you lost I dont have to send
you up

Frank looks confused Gerson hands Frank a printout of a
lab report Frank looks it over it makes no sense to
him

FRANK
I dont know what this shit means

GERSON
It means someone didnt pass his
physical One of you has cancer

Frank goes white tentatively turns the page over of the
lab report sees in cruel military typeface HAWKINS
WILLIAM B Franks mouth goes dry

GERSON
Its his pancreas And its
inoperable

FRANK
Does he know
GERSON
Dr Caruthers told him this
morning

Frank shakes his head getting angry again
FRANK
No I dont trust you This is
bullshit

He tears up the lab report throws the scraps on Gersons
desk

FRANK
I want independent tests done by
independent doctors -- not ones

you bankroll to lie for you and

print up bullshit lab results
(catches his breath)

This is low even by your

standards Just to keep me from

going into space

Gerson smiles smugly

GERSON
Oh thats what this drama is all
about And this whole time I
thought it was Hawk your friend
But its really your seat on the
space shuttle isnt it You can
rest easy Frank NASA is still
sending you Jerry and Tank up on
the shuttle -- regardless of the
‘deal you and I made

FRANK
I dont understand

GERSON
Youre front page news Frank A
real American hero Youve made
NASA popular all over again
Thanks to you theyre gonna get
that juicy budget infusion theyve
been drooling over Oh youre
going Frank The Vice President
insists

Gerson opens up the laptop prepares to reconnect

GERSON
Now if youll excuse me I have to
call the head of our space program
back and apologize for the
interruption

Across from the space center complex One of NASAs and

NEXT TO SR-

is Hawk dressed in civilian clothes He walks the plane
silently deep in thought As he ducks under the
fuselage he sees --

SARA

watching him walk the plane The obvious doesnt need to
be said

HAWK
This was my Blackbird I retired
this very airplane in 90 And
here she is

SARA
Ive never actually seen one

Hawk smiles like a proud parent showing off his kid

HAWK

supposed to be Shes ugly on the
ground leaks like a sieve But
up around mach one her seals all
expand she dries up and leans
into the wind and goes like hell
I took her right to the edge

He runs his hand along the planes skin softly
reverently

HAWK
Shes only happy up there goin
fast Shes not meant to be
sitting on the ground Thats a
lousy way to die Sitting around
waiting

(pauses )
Eight months Thats the best I
can do huh

SARA
They dont know that for sure
Theres chemo Radiation

HAWK
(shakes his head)
I watched my wife go out that way
I aint taking that road

She nods making sense of the other evening

SARA
(softly)
The love of your life

HAWK
(changing the subject)
Where the hell is the pancreas
anyway I dont even know what
the damn thing does beside give
you cancer

They share a weak laugh

HAWK
What odds would you have given us

SARA
Better than forty

She smiles coyly He kisses her and they hug

FRANK

approaches tentatively from the other end of the hangar
He sees Hawk and Sara break out of the hug and say a
few words Frank stops and waits respectfully Sara
walks away from Hawk passing Frank

SARA
Hi Frank

FRANK
Sara

Frank approaches Hawk cant find the words

HAWK
Im sorry Frank I know how much
this flight meant to you Looks
like I crashed another one Im
sorry
Frank dreads what he has to say next

Hawk turns on his heels and walks off He

stops and

life was Frank The day I met
you and you put the idea in my
head that I could pilot a ship
into space

into the bulkhead

ETHAN
Youre only here as a publicity
stunt You got what you wanted
youre in space Now finish the
mission

Frank looks duped and unhappy about it

INT MISSION CONTROL - LATER

CUT TO

Frank is

CUT TO

Davis Sara Gerson and Vostov look up at Frank on the
video screen

DAVIS
Okay Frank This is a secure
line

FRANK (VO)
You have good reason not to want
this bird to fall Gene It has
six armed nuclear warheads
onboard

Davis turns to Gerson incredulous

DAVIS
Whats he talking about

Gerson looks as incredulous as everyone else

GERSON
I have no idea
(to Vostov)
General is there something youd
like to tell us

At first Vostov looks betrayed then faces Sara and
Davis

VOSTOV
Ikon is a relic from the cold war
It has floated dead in space ever
since the Soviet Union fell
There are six missiles onboard
targeted at strategic American
installations All most
regrettably in large metropolitan
areas If Ikon goes off-line it
will assume that there has been a
catastrophe and will initiate
launch on its own

The silence is deafening

SARA
You picked a helluva time for a
confession General

GERSON
(indignant)
Those are our men up there This
is a treaty violation A big one

VOSTOV
(under his breath)
You bastard
FRANK (VO)

You know its really touching
Bob -- your concern for our safety
and all While youre at it
maybe you could ask the General
how my guidance system for SkyLab
ended up on this six-gun

Gerson squirms

VOSTOV
It was stolen by the KGB from Mr
Gersons personal files

Sara and Davis look at Gerson shocked Gerson acts
aghast

GERSON
This is all new to me

FRANK (VO)

Youd hook us on to this bastard
put it back into orbit fully
armed and keep it a secret just
to save your own ass

DAVIS
People we have a real problem to
deal with We dont have time for
this now

INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT
Frank looks morose Hawk kills the transmit switch

HAWK
Huddle We got a big-ass problem
Were locked into a 20-megaton
hydrogen bomb going 17000 miles
an hour

FRANK
Jerry how high can we send this
shitheap Can we get it into deep
space

JERRY
With three Payload Assist rockets
Just Maybe I dont know
The AIRLOCK OPEN light blinks accompanied by a BUZZER

FRANK
What the hells that

Hawk floats to the side window sees Ethan in the MMU
floating towards the satellite towing the Payload Assist
Modules (three four-foot-long rockets strapped to an

aluminum pallet

) with a tether

into the communicator

Ethan

Your
back

You d
Ethan

Ethan

FRANK
what are you doing

ETHAN (VO)
job Frank Im putting Ikon
into geo-sync orbit

FRANK
ont know what youre doing
Get back here

(on no response)

EXT IKON - THAT MOMENT

Frank furiously shouts

Ethan propelling himself towards Ikon flicks OFF his

RADIO cutting off Frank

MMU to the side

of the satellite

INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

Frank goes to the airlock door

Frank

Open

EXT IKON - THAT

Ethan unbuckles

JERRY
he jammed the airlock door

FRANK
the panel and override it

MOMENT

the rockets and removes one The

two float freely next to him in space He starts
the rocket in place on a circuited bracket on the belly
of the satellite

INT SHUTTLE
THAT MOMENT

Frank talks into the communicator

Ethan

FRANK
Do not lock-on the PAM

rockets do you read me

(urgent to Jerry)

How long

JERRY

I almost have it Frank

He reaches Ikon latching his

other
locking
EXT IKON - THAT MOMENT

Ethan locks the first PAM rocket in place As he
clamps it down it suddenly FIRES a SHORT POWERFUL BURST
-- The satellite lurches on the shuttles arm twisting
it heading right towards the shuttle

INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

The SATELLITE CRASHES into the BULKHEAD with an ENORMOUS
BOOM The bracing and shelving collapses under the
weight and on top of Roger He is slammed to the floor
head bleeding badly

Pandemonium Pressure leak starts oxygen escapes a
fire in the aft crew compartment Team Daedalus reacts
all their actions drilled they attack the situation
swiftly

TANK
Rogers hurt mid-deck Bleeding
bad

FRANK

Hes yours Tank

JERRY
We got a fire in here

HAWK
Coming in

As he floats by the window hatch fighting the smoke he

glances outside -- and freezes in horror
HAWK
Oh shit
(shouting)

We lost Ikon and Ethan

SATELLITE IKON

has bounced off the shuttle and is falling towards Earth
It is taking the shuttles broken retractor arm and
Ethan in MMU with it It moves at what looks to be
about 2 mph It jetisons six panels in unison leaving
debris in its wake

ETHAN (VO)
(over radio)
Help me

Hawk flies over to Frank sucking on an oxygen regulator
FRANK
(as Hawk nods)
Tank Contain the situation
Hawk and I are going out

Frank and Hawk reach the airlock door Jerry works
frantically on the doors control panel

FRANK
Hurry up Were losing them

The airlock door opens Hawk and Frank hurry in

INT MISSION CONTROL - THAT MOMENT

Pandemonium here too Engineers return to their
stations Sara watches in horror as the satellite drifts
away from Daedalus

ENGINEER
Range 200 meters Its
accelerating Miss Holland

SARA
Theyre gonna lose it

INT AIRLOCK - THAT MOMENT

Hawk and Frank finish their suit-up They fall back into
the MMUs and strap them on

Hawk hyperventilates the pure oxygen trying to replace
the nitrogen in his blood with pure 02

FRANK
How long till Ikon goes off-line

JERRY
Those missiles are heating up
right now You got five minutes
but by that time itll be out of
your range

HAWK
Anything else you want to know

FRANK
Blow the seal

The AIRLOCK SEAL BLOWS Hawk and Frank jet out --

INTO SPACE

FIRING their MMUs nitrogen JETS towards the fleeing
satellite side-by-side Ikon is about two hundred feet
away

FRANK
Latch-on Starboard On my signal
fire all jets

They split up Frank latches his MMU on to one side of
the satellite Hawk latches on to the other

FRANK
Fire

The JETS on the two MMUs FIRE in unison nitrogen vapor
spraying out This is a tough battle but theyre
winning gradually slowing the satellites fall Hawk
glances at a readout on the MMU NITROGEN FUEL AT TEN
PERCENT

HAWK
Im at ten percent Frank

FRANK
Dont let it get past five or
were not getting back to the
ship

They both release their fingers from the jet triggers
They look up towards the shuttle for a reference They
have stopped the satellite

HAWK
Shes static

FRANK
Houston weve arrested the fall

INT MISSION CONTROL - THAT MOMENT
A collective exhale a collective cheer

DAVIS
Attaboy Frank

EXT IKON - THAT MOMENT

Frank hovers over Ethan still in his MMU pinned in by
the damaged grappling arm Frank releases the arm
pushes it away and peers inside Ethans face-plate sees
movement

FRANK
Hes out

HAWK
Throw me the other payload assist
modules Ill hook them up while
you bring Johnny Quest back to the
ship

Frank looks at the empty pallet then into space sees
the two PAM rockets floating away irretrievable

FRANK
We got a problem We only have
one rocket

JERRY (VO)
One PAMs not gonna get this
thing into orbit Frank Without
active course correction the damn
thing1ll go in a circle like a
boat with one oar in the water

Hawk looks at the satellite sees that two of the solar
panels are crumpled like tin foil

HAWK
(to Frank)
You got another problem

Frank looks over sees the broken panels

FRANK
Shit Even if we do get her up
she cant power herself with two
broken panels

Frank looks down at Earth sighs flustered defeated

HAWK
Bring the kid back Let me take
care of this

FRANK
And how exactly are you gonna take
care of this professor Youre a
pilot

Hawk propels over to a panel on the satellite pops it
open

HAWK
Stand back Blowing solar panels

FRANK
Hawk what are you --

Hes interrupted by a MUFFLED EXPLOSION as the giant
solar panels blow off Frank stares at Hawk
dumbfounded but he knows what Hawks got planned

HAWK
Throw me your auxiliary 02 module
Frank wont Cant

FRANK

HAWK

I love you Frank but why do you
always have to be such a killjoy

(beat)
You only got one rocket This
damn thing aint gonna steer
itself You need a pilot

(as he tilts his head

at the moon)
Besides you ever seen a prettier
moon

Frank looks at the moon

JERRY (V0)
Whats he talking about Frank

They ignore Jerry

FRANK
Were a quarter-million miles
away Youll never make it

HAWK
Sure I will Itll be just like
hitting a baseball to the moon
All I gotta do is get myself
halfway there the moons
gravitys gonna do the rest Ill
fire these things into deep space
and let ‘em self-destruct

Frank thinks long and hard Finally he detaches his
auxiliary 02 tank tosses it to Hawk He rips off
Ethans too tosses it over Hawk clips them onto his
MMU

HAWK
Somebodys gotta be first in every
race Guess it had to be me this
time

FRANK
Like always dammit

Frank pulls Ethan out of his MMU

INT MISSION CONTROL - MOMENTS LATER

All rapt by the sight on screen -- Hawk setting the
payload assist module talking to Tank
TANK
Pitch should be set at 060
degrees

HAWK (VO)
Roger 060

INT CREW CABIN - THAT MOMENT

The airlock door opens Frank floats into the cabin from
the airlock holding Ethan Jerry is in Franks face
immediately

JERRY
You cant let him do this
Theres gotta be another way

FRANK
There isnt Ill explain later
(beat)
Whats our status here

JERRY
(shocked at Frank)
The orbital maneuvering engines
were destroyed in the fire
Computer guidance is gone and we
lost a few heat tiles

FRANK
Hows Roger
JERRY
Concussion
(hesitates)

Hes out of action Frank Youre
gonna have to pilot this bird in

Frank swallows hard He looks over at Tank

TANK
Dont look at me I havent flown
anything bigger than a Cessna in
thirty years

They hear Hawks rich LAUGHTER over the RADIO

EXT SHUTTLE - HAWK

climbs into Ethans vacant MMU straps in still
laughing The moon hangs overhead feels so close you
could reach out and grab it

HAWK
(laughing)
Hey Frank its starting to look
like I got the better end of this
deal

FRANK (VO)
Quit laughing you dummy Youre
using up oxygen

HAWK
Alright Lets shoot this baby to
the moon

INT SHUTTLE - ON FRANK

He flicks up a safety guard on a control panel and hovers
his finger over a trigger A poignant sardonic grin
overcomes him

FRANK
Im gonna countdown to one

FRANK AND HAWK (VO)
One

Frank hits the button

A bright light -- the PAM IGNITES The satellite
begins to quake then streaks away

EXT SPACE

Hawks head arcs back as he and the satellite accelerate
to the moon which is looming large ahead Hawks war
whoop can barely be heard over the ROAR of the ENGINE

He makes course corrections with pulses from the nitrogen
jets

ON SPACE SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT
Pin-drop silence Frank watches through the window
Hawk getting smaller heading right for the moon The
PAM burns out (normal) Quiet then --
HAWK (VO)
(singing over radio)
Fly me to the moon and let me play
among the stars

STATIC CRACKLES as his voice transmission gets weaker

DISSOLVE TO

INT MISSION CONTROL - AM

Sara watches the trajectory screen at the front of the
room Drained -- exhausted mentally and physically The

situation is serious Davis comes out of a huddle with
flight controllers and motions Sara to join him at an
unoccupied station

DAVIS
Ikon has left our gravitational
field Hawk was able to launch
the missiles into deep space

She nods slowly a tear swelling up in her eye

SARA
Hows Daedalus

DAVIS
Shes a damaged ship Theyre
gonna have to reenter the
atmosphere find the correct glide
slope and put her down with no
power and no computer

SARA
Thats impossible

DAVIS
Well its never been done The
only two pilots alive that could
even think about it are Roger and
Hawk Rogers wounded and
Hawks

Sara shuts down emotions and is all business now

SARA
Lets get them in as close as we
can and abort the landing
Theyll have to bail out Whats
the survival probability

DAVIS
Twenty percent At best But
its zero if they try to set her
down The ships dead She might
not even glide with the structural
damage

SARA
Twentys better than zero

She places her headset back on goes back to work

CUT TO

INT SPACE SHUTTLE DAEDALUS - LATER

The men go about preparations for reentry in silence

Full pressure suits attached to their parachutes Frank
eases the injured Roger into his Tank helps Ethan Both
are helpless look like children being dressed by a
parent

Tank and Jerry retract the drag chute arm that will
deploy under the shuttles wing to release them when they
jump

INT SHUTTLE - COCKPIT

Frank sits at the controls warning lights blinking
everywhere reading a thick operations manual Tank
makes his way up

TANK
You all right

Frank nods Tank looks compassionate

TANK
You gonna be able to do this

FRANK
I dont know I never imagined
having to without Hawk

He exhales a big sigh Tank reaches into his pocket
pulls out

HULA GIRL
from the dash of his B-50 in 1958

He sticks it on the instrument display panel and she
starts to dance Frank looks at Tank like hes crazy

FRANK
You saved that thing

CAPCOM (VO)
Daedalus Stand by for Eugene
Davis

DAVIS (VO)
Frank the judgement here is to go
for California Were gonna get
you as close as we can to Edwards
Now youre still inverted And
youre flying tail first
Ordinarily wed do a de-orbit
burn to right her --

FRANK
-- but we dont have an engine to
do that with
DAVIS (VO)
Youre gonna have to jostle her a
little -- bringing her around with
your speed and a little gravity
Go easy though Youre still at
17000 miles per hour

Frank eases the stick over and around Shes not very
responsive He gives it a pull and the ship snap-rolls
and begins shaking violently

FRANK
Whoaaaa shit

DAVIS (VO)
Easy Frank Shes not a fighter
jet

Frank taps on the rudder pedals and pulls hard on the
stick until the horizon changes Earth is below him now
instead of over his head He lets out the breath hes
been holding
FRANK
Okay were righted
INT MISSION CONTROL

Not a small amount of shock on the faces Davis lets out
the breath he was holding

DAVIS
Thats a good start

INTERCUT WITH Frank

Frank looks at the altimeter -- 400000 feet
FRANK
Houston we are at entry
interface
DAVIS

Roger Frank Youre gonna punch
in here in 15 seconds Im gonna
lose you till you hit the
stratosphere Frank youve shed
some tiles Shes gonna heat up
on you

FRANK
Roger Houston

DAVIS
10 seconds Frank youve got the
procedure Its not optimum but
I want all you guys home
Understood

FRANK
We copy Daedalus out

DAVIS
Good luck Frank
(to engineers)
Okay folks Here we go

INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT
Frank grabs the stick glancing over at Tank

FRANK
You wanna pray now Rev

TANK
What the hell you think Ive been
doing

Tank sees the worry and concentration in Franks face and
smiles

TANK
What would Hawk do

Frank shakes his head Hes not Hawk The shuttle
begins to bounce entering our atmosphere And heat up
With no orbital maneuvering engines theyre coming in
more than 50 percent faster than they should And the
ride is about 100 percent more bumpy Frank talks into
his communicator His voice shaking from the
turbulence at the very least

FRANK
Its gonna be a very steep dive so
we dont overshoot Im gonna
have to pull a couple very tight
turns to slow her down -- last one
at 13000 At ten well be over
California I want everybody up
and clipped then Im blowing the
hatch at 5000 and out we go
Ethan and Roger first make sure
they clear the wing Everybody
got that

They all affirm And Frank pushes the nose over into a
steep dive DAEDALUS GROANS in response Her airframe
was not designed for this

EXT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

Tiles flake away shes heating up to 2000 degrees
INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

Agony in the faces The ship bounces wildly anything
not locked down in steel flies about the cabin The hula
girl dances madly

FRANK
Come on baby Hold it together

Franks knuckles are white holding the stick jamming
the unresponsive rudders First turn over Japan 50
miles up Shes heating up to 2500 now And theyre
feeling it inside the men sweating like crazy The
AIRFRAME is SCREECHING in protest

ROGER
Thats too steep Frank
gonna fall apart on you

Shes

INT MISSION CONTROL - THAT MOMENT
They track the ship unable to communicate

TRAJECTORY ENGINEER
Altitude 30 miles over Guam

EXT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

The skins over 3000 now the left wing shaking its
rivets

INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

Its an oven Frank has to wipe the sweat away from his
eyes to see He tries to level off but she wont
respond He fights and curses it Nothing He stops
thinking what would Hawk do

Then throws the stick over -- a major and unnatural
bank Then banks it right back across zig-zagging to
slow it down Ethan screams in protest at the same
pitch as the BENDING METAL

But Roger nods This will work Frank pulls one last
time and they bank into their turn heading south over
Hawaii

FRANK
Thats it baby One more turn
Come on line me up Line me

up

Frank battles with the stick like the Old Man and the Sea
fighting the Great Fish His face shows a warriors

calm

The SHIP levels off at 10 miles shaking and RATTLING
like a 55 Chevy on a dirt road and turns for home And
Franks agonized grimace eases

INT MISSION CONTROL - THAT MOMENT

BURSTS of STATIC

CAPCOM
Hes trying to call sir

DAVIS
Hes fried his antenna
Trajectory where is he

TRAJECTORY
Hes on final But he is way too
hot Hes gonna overshoot to
Colorado at this rate
INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

The moment of calm is gone

TANK
35000 Were going way too fast

Looking ahead cloud and marine layer at the California
coast

TANK
We cant bail out at Mach 2
Frank

FRANK

Im gliding at 22 degrees We can
slow down some but the most we
can hope for is Mach 1 That or
we go in 1000 miles past

TANK
Your call

The decision The shuttle feels like it could break up
at any moment The cloud cover looms ahead as they drop
rapidly

TANK
Come up on 10

FRANK
Everybody up Hook on

He begins to weave the shuttle in long back and forth
turns -- trying to slow her down

MISSION CONTROL - THAT MOMENT
Horror on the faces
DAVIS
No Frank no
SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT
7000 feet In the clouds Mach 1

FRANK
Stand by Okay Tank Clip on

TANK
What about you

FRANK
I just need a visual so I can line
her up on Death Valley and Im
out Blowing the hatch

He throws a switch the EXPLOSIVE BOLTS BLOW and the 600
MPH WIND HOWLS through Daedalus

IN CREW CABIN

Jerry muscles the drag chute arm into place and clips
Roger in

JERRY
You ready

ROGER
Yeah

Jerry lifts him up and shoves him out on the arm
keeping him clear of the wobbling wing

JERRY
One gone

Jerry shoves Ethan forward smiles as he lets him fly

JERRY
Two gone

And the clouds dissolve beneath them Looking back they
can see two chutes opened floating gently down

FRANK
Get out now
Looking ahead Frank can see theyre too high for
Edwards too low to overshoot a desert oasis community of
tract homes in the distance The shuttle is on the line
to crash right into it

Franks decision is instantaneous Hes staying with it
He turns around to see Jerry and Tank pausing at the
hatchway

FRANK
What the hell are you waiting for

They unclip simultaneously

JERRY
Were a team Frank

FRANK
Go dammit Thats an order

TANK
Were staying
Frank throws the stick over plunging them down
Whatever momentum he lost hes got it all back now A
normal 22 degree descent is now 50 Theyre heading in
like a missile

FRANK
Airspeed

TANK
500 Pull it up

Frank holds the dive seeing --

TWO FIGHTER ESCORTS
on either side
FIGHTER (VO)
Daedalus this is Recover Five
Youre way too hot Recommend
abort -- Abort now

Frank levels it off

FRANK
Negative Recover Im taking her
in

TANK

410 Here comes the runway

FRANK
No problem
Just like Hawk in the simulator he hums to himself
totally in his element a look of peace overcomes him

FRANK
you just gotta tap the brakes

INT AIR FORCE F- - THAT MOMENT

The PILOT watches in disbelief as the shuttles nose
pitches up

PILOT
Shit hes lost it Mayday
Mayday

INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

The STALL ALARM is WAILING The left wing is about to
go

FRANK
Call my airspeed

TANK
350 310 280 -- shes stalling
Frank Youre gonna go over

Drop the nose

FRANK
Speed

TANK
215 Drop the nose

FRANK
Whattaya say we drop the nose

10 5 2 1 touchdown Shes wobbly bouncing
leaning hard right with the damaged left wing Frank
stamps on the brakes as the drag chute opens -- and she
levels off a landing almost identical to Hawks in the
simulator

INT MISSION CONTROL (HOUSTON)

Watching the shuttle roll gently to a stop at the far end
of the runway Barbara watches nervously

FRANK (VO)
Wheels stop Daedalus is home

They rise as one cheering wildly Barbara bursts out
crying Sara grabs the woman and holds her tight Davis
sighs
DAVIS

Im getting too old for this shit
ON GERSON
He hesitates for a moment then forces a smile and claps
his hands disingenuously
BACK TO SCENE
The media rushes back into the room
Davis makes his way through the room shaking hands He

sees Sara staring at the screen crying He heads for
her Sara puts an arm on his shoulder

SARA
Gene

DAVIS
Yeah

SARA

Never mind

(as Davis looks back

at the screen)
You think its too late for me to
re-join the program as an
astronaut

DAVIS
(nodding at the
big screen)
That oughtta answer your question

She smiles Something catches Daviss eye he turns to
see Gerson talking to a news crew

GERSON
I never doubted Frank for a
minute I brought Frank on to
Project Daedalus forty years ago
and I brought him in for this
mission and I can tell you
this

EXT DESERT - MILES BEHIND
A Navy CH-54 rescue helicopter eases down Two rescue

personnel bound out to assist Ethan and Roger -- shaken
but standing

INT SHUTTLE - THAT MOMENT

Frank turns to look at Jerry and Tank
JERRY

Just a walk in the park Frank
FRANK
slumps back closing his eyes Opening his eyes slowly
he sees the only thing moving in the shuttle --
FRANKS POV - HULA GIRL
Her crazy jig slowly comes to an end

DISSOLVE TO

ANGLE ON FULL MOON - NIGHT

The sound of CRICKETS in the night

EXT FRANKS HOUSE (YOUNTVILLE CA) - NIGHT

Frank stares at the moon deep in thought He doesnt
notice Barbara joining him at his side

BARBARA
You think he made it

Frank slowly breaks into a pensive grin as FLY ME TO THE
MOON FADES SLOWLY UP

FRANK
Yeah I think he made it

His eyes travel back to the moon

EXT MOON - SEA OF TRANQUILITY - THAT MOMENT

We are MOVING IN TOWARDS the moon slowly the shadowed
contours of the sand dunes and craters getting sharper
SINATRAS VOICE KICKS IN Something PASSES us --
SATELLITE IKON

And as it passes we see Hawk still attached to it in his
MMU The satellite gently hits the edge of a sand dune
the soft surface cushioning the impact The satellite
bounces once throwing --

HAWK

Out of the MMU
SATELLITE

spins topples over and lands back on the moon

HAWK

arcs and tumbles through the air until the moons gravity
gently pulls him back down on to the deep pillow-soft
moon dust where he bounces once then lays motionless

TIGHT ON HAWKS FACEPLATE

The Earth is reflected and we cant see his face cant
tell whether hes alive or dead Then in VOICE OVER we
hear HAWKS joyous LAUGHTER

WIDER - HAWK

Lying there flat on his back There is a deep
impression around him in the lunar dust where he fell
especially around his arms and legs Maybe it was the
fall Or maybe like a kid at Winters first snow fall

he was making angels in the virgin snow

FADE OUT

THE END
