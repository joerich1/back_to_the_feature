MINORITY REPORT

-- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen

DARKNESS

And then slowly emerging from the mists of darkness a pale
beautifully proportioned FACE

The oval face is female a woman of indeterminate age her
features as fragile as porcelain Her eyes are closed in
sleep or in death or in something in between

Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness They are
male and they float into position on either side of the
female They are just as ethereally beautiful just as pale
and like the female their eyes are closed

The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch Her features
which have been expressionless suddenly contort mask-like
into the face of a woman in fear Her eyes open

The male face on her right contorts too His features warp
into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged His eyes
open

The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
boy a boy who is terribly frightened His eyes open wide

As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream a
sudden and unnerving exchange begins

FEMALE
(frightened woman)
JOHNNY PLEASE

MALE RIGHT
(mocking man)
Johnny please Johnny please

FEMALE
Youre scaring me

MALE LEFT
(childs voice)
DADDY DONT DADDY

MALE RIGHT
(considering)
I dont like you any more Carol

FEMALE
(imploring)
Put the scissors down Youre scaring
me Please
MALE RIGHT
Oh Carol

FEMALE
Johnny Stop

MALE RIGHT
Dont grab at me Let

MALE LEFT
Daddy No

All we see are three faces on the screen mouthing words but
we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us a
man with scissors lunging at his wife her anguished scream
the whimpering cries of their son

And then there is silence and it is over and the three
faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state
Their eyes slowly close They do not move

So that when they do move again it is startling In abrupt
unison the EYES flash open Three pairs of eyes stare
straight at us accusing

Three mouths open but speak in rasping tones as one

ALL THREE
Murderer

The faces linger a moment the weary eyes slowly close and
the dark reaches forth and takes them

DISSOLVE TO
EXT SUBURBIA DAY

Morning in America Just look at it America in the
midfifties the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
the sun drenched distance White house upon white house
Emerald lawns glistening with dew

In each driveway a big Chevy or a Ford muscled with chrome
long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships

Kids burst out of the houses and zoom down sidewalks on
trikes Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways
watching The smiling mothers wave to one another then go
back into their houses

Dogs bark birds sing in trees of just the right height
boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes It
is a delicious world where dogs and birds and children are
safe

INT A HOUSE

A family room with all the trappings of the era a flagstone
fireplace a console TV a mans leatherette Barca-Lounger
a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table boxes of
childrens games neatly stacked on a wall shelf

A young mother CAROL her hair -in a pony-tail stands at a
picture window in a corner of the family room staring mildly
at the scene outside

CAROLS POV - A LITTLE GIRL

A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk The ball
gets away from her and rolls into the street

At the same moment a two-toned CHEVY lush and huge rounds
the corner

The girl sees the car coming but still goes after the ball
THE FAMILY ROOM

Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesnt cry
out or bang on the window or run for the front door She
watches And smiles a little

OUTSIDE

The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street

INSIDE THE CHEVY

The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit white
shirt thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
the car

Disturbingly the mans hands are not on the steering wheel
Not only that he is holding the morning newspaper up in
front of him reading oblivious to the scene before him

Through the windshield we see the little girl in the road
in front of him going for her ball

CAROL Watches her smile in place
OUTSIDE

The little girl picks up her red ball as the Chevy bears
down on her

INSIDE THE CHEVY

An alarm suddenly CHIRPS The car automatically brakes to a
halt The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
what is happening

THE STREET

The car has stopped inches from the girl

The girl giggles as the man in the car gives her a big wink
She waves then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball

The man goes back to his newspaper and the car entirely on
its own starts up again The car rounds a corner and
disappears

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Carol turns away from the window She startles when she
sees her husband JOHNNY is there behind her He is in his
pajamas How long has he been there watching her

JOHNNY
(gruff)
Whyd you let me sleep so long

CAROL
Its Saturday Johnny you always --
(beat)
Why are you staring at me like that

He takes a step toward her He stands there his thick black
hair tousled with sleep scratching his stubbled jaw
considering her

JOHNNY

Im unhappy that you let me sleep so
long

He takes another step toward her She doesnt move a muscle
A little BOY suddenly enters the room Johnny turns looks
at his son looks back over his shoulder at his wife Then
without a word he begins to walk out of the room On his
way out Johnnys eyes flick to Carols sewing basket which
sits beside a sewing machine It is not the sewing that has
caught his attention but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
which lie across a fold of colored cloth

EXT THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Johnny stands on the front porch scratching He walks down
his front walk and bends over to pick up the newspaper
Carol stands in the doorway watching him

A SHADOW slides over Johnny cast from above The air fills
with the piercing WHINE of an engine Johnny looks up
alarmed

In the sky above him just beyond the tips of the suburban
trees is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT

The children the mothers Carol in the doorway -- everyone
freezes in place as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
drama

Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him are SLEEK
TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS lethal and efficient looking -- they
seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
process them

Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars
More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses Their
uniforms are black seem actually to absorb light Their
left hands are bare their right hands are encased in some
sort of complicated glove

CLOSE
ON - A GLOVE

The glove is a weapon of some kind the elongated index finger
ending in an open barrel

Clearly this is not as it first seemed the past -- not
America in the 1950s It is the neo-past the retro world
of America 2040 where the familiar of yesterday is
intermeshed with hypertechnology

And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY as he
makes a run for the house sheets of newspaper scattering
behind him He bursts up the front porch shoving Carol out
of the way

Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard From a
backpack one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
handle grip and an ovoid screen It is a holographic scanner

He activates it scans the OFFICER in front of him and an
IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form
The two real officers circle the house repeating the maneuver
a dozen times

In less than a minute a decoy force of men -- three
dimensional standing in place but shifting and turning
like living beings -- has been created An overwhelming

police deterrent presence has been established
INSIDE THE HOUSE

The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house
too It is impossible to tell which officers are real and
which are scanned holographs The juxtaposition of the
futuristic cops in a 1950s style house is disorienting

INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET

Johnny in his pajamas crouches beneath a rack full of his
wifes dresses

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Two OFFICERS standing back-to-back hold their gloved hands
out in front of them palm out When the first officer points
his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway his glove
BEEPS softly

The officer looks at his PALM A red thermal IMAGE appears

on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
man The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
officer

THE BEDROOM
The room is packed with police -- how many are real
THE CLOSET

Johnny squirms his pajamas saturated with sweat He calls
out through the door

JOHNNY
I didnt do anything

OUTSIDE THE CLOSET
Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
his index barrel at the closet door The effect is deeply

accusatory

An OFFICER speaks his VOICE electronically manipulated to
be as menacing as possible
OFFICER 1
Come out of the closet on your hands
and knees

Nothing happens Two officers aim their barrels at the
perimeter of the door In repeated small SONIC BLASTS the
closet door is blown off of its frame revealing Johnny among
the dresses

Johnny starts to rise and BAM a section of floorboards is
blasted away beneath his feet

OFFICER 1
Hands and knees

Johnny trips among the splintered floorboards and drops
He stays on his hands and knees and approaches He lifts
his head and looks up at the officer

JOHNNY
I didnt
Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
TdentiScan on its side -- and blips a red laser light

into each of Johnnys eyes reading his irises The
officer nods affirmatively to the other officer

OFFICER 2
POSITIVE FOR JOHN PALMER

OFFICER 1

(to Johnny)
John Palmer if you were being
arrested for any other crime I would
now read you your rights

(beat)
But you are under arrest for the
future murderer of your wife Carol
Palmer You have no rights

Johnny on his hands and knees goes limp

EXT THE HOUSE -- LATER

In the background Johnny is guided into a Precrime police
vehicle as the neighbors look on Carol and her son stand
in the doorway stunned

TWO OFFICERS remove their helmets The first man is tall
sandy-haired good eyes deeply blue This is PAUL ANDERSON
late thirties Director of the Precrime Division Washington
DC

The second man is ED WITWER Andersons second in command
late thirties big like Anderson good face strong in the
shoulders short brown hair

The two men are deeply comfortable together They can speak
or not It doesnt matter -- they still communicate Two
good cops good together

They walk side-by-side around the house dematerializing the
holographic decoy cops

WITWER
Thought we might a had a runner

Anderson seems tired takes a moment to answer

ANDERSON
Yeah a runner

WITWER
A little chase -- thatd been good

ANDERSON
Fifty cops on the scene takes the
chase out of them

WITWER
(smiles)
But only eight of us were real

Witwer dematerializes the last decoy

ANDERSON
We ever get a runner Id be too old
to give chase

WITWER
Youd chase Youd love it Man

They get to the front of the house and watch the Precrime
vehicle holding Johnny zoom SOUNDLESSLY away

ANDERSON
I love it more Johnny boy doesnt
get to murder his wife

WITWER

(beat)
Its a beautiful world
EXT SAME SCENE -- LATER

The children play on their trikes The wives talk among
themselves The birds sing the dogs bark

The little girl bounces her red ball again She stops a
minute when two pieces of newspaper blow past her
unexpectantly littering the orderly suburban landscape

INT A BEDROOM - SUBURBAN VIRGINIA (OUTSIDE WASHINGTON) DAY

Decorated in a 1950s style Anderson lies in bed beside
his wife LISA a pretty green-eyed brunette It is early
morning they are both awake Her hand caresses his chest
Maybe they will make love

Lisas hand stops suddenly on the center of Andersons chest

LISA
Jesus Paul Your hearts hammering
(playfully)
I excite you that much

He turns to her and the grim set of his jaw makes her smile
vanish

ANDERSON
I used to love being a cop

LISA
Youre still a cop Ima factory
worker We dont catch murderers
We process them

Lisa takes a long breath Shes been down this road before
She speaks reassuringly

LISA
Youre the best homicide cop in the
country

ANDERSON snorts disdainfully

ANDERSON
Great -- except theres no such thing
as homicide What I do best doesnt
exist anymore

LISA
PAUL
(beat)
Youre the Director of a perfect
system A Cop with a perfect record

ANDERSON
The Precogs have a perfect record
They identify the accused -- I just
put on my monkey suit and go round

them up
Lisa hugs him kisses the back of his neck

LISA
And then I prosecute them And they
go to jail And lives are saved
Thousands of lives
(beat)
And thats a cops dream

Anderson is silent for a time He sighs then smiles and
turns to his wife takes her in his arms

ANDERSON
No Youre a cops dream

INT THE BATHROOM -- LATER

Anderson steps out of the shower and begins to towel himself
dry- He glances out a casement window He tilts his head
curious then wipes at the steam on the window

ANDERSONS POV LISA

Lisa stands in the backyard in her nightgown talking on a
cell phone She hangs up moves quickly back into the house

ANDERSON

Cocks his head then goes back to toweling off

INT KITCHEN -- LATER

Checkered linoleum floor Appliances out of the 1950s
Except there are little differences When Lisa puts a skillet
of eggs on the stove the heating element is not an electric
coil or gas but a shimmering field of light

Lisa is dressed in a blue jersey skirt and a brief jacket
Anderson wears a gray suit thin blue tie white shirt
wingtipped shoes He doesnt look up from the newspaper as

he speaks

ANDERSON
Who called
Lisa keeps her back to him as she flips the eggs She touches
her long brown hair

LISA
No one I called about my hair
Getting it done this afternoon

Anderson looks like hes about to say something else when
suddenly someone RAPS on the back screen door Anderson and
Lisa both turn and smile

ANDERSON
Come on in neighbor Want some
coffee

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

FRANK DIGNAZIO 65 white-haired robust hesitates before
coming in A thin METALLIC ARM with a red laser light arches
quickly down from above the doorway shines into each of his
EYES scanning the irises The arm lifts out of view the
screen door UNLATCHES

Frank enters the kitchen carrying a basket of tomatoes

FRANK DIGNAZIO
Brought these for your supper

LISA
Oh Frank Thats so sweet Thank
you

FRANK DIGNAZIO
Sweet nothing I gotta get rid of
these things One plant and Im
invaded by tomatoes When I was a
kid

Anderson laughs claps his friend and neighbor on the back
teases him

ANDERSON
Before all this genetically engineered
crap

Frank gives him an ornery look then a smile

FRANK DIGNAZIO
Yeah well its true It used to be
a challenge to grow things An art
Now you put one plant in the ground
-- then jump the hell out of the
way

Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down
ANDERSON

Coffee

FRANK DIGNAZIO
Nah thanks Cant stay You guys
are rushing off to work anyway

Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson

LISA
You and Ellie come for supper then

ANDERSON
Well barbecue

Frank nods and pushes on the screen door

FRANK DIGNAZIO
You betcha Well bring some more
tomatoes -- a new batch will have
grown by then

They all laugh Frank exits Anderson goes back to his paper
EXT DRIVEWAY -- LATER

Anderson waves to Lisa Her big Studebaker drives off down
the tree-lined street and away

Anderson approaches his Chevy He doesnt take out a key to
unlock it There is no lock He slides in behind the wheel
Doesnt take out a key for the ignition -- there is no

ignition

A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor scans
Andersons EYES identifying him A seat harness wraps around
him and the car STARTS

Anderson picks up a folder marked Precrime and begins to
read through the papers The Chevy backs out of the driveway
and takes him to work

EXT INTERSTATE 95 - ALEXANDRIA VA -- LATER

A vast spread of corporate and government buildings -- the
spillover from Washington DC across the Potomac River into
Virginia

Beyond the white of Washington is The Sprawl -- the massive
unzoned city that has spread uncontrolled on the outskirts
of the Capitol It is impenetrable and uninviting especially
to those comfortable in the utopian suburbs

Andersons Chevy moves in a sea of fifties-type cars
Occasionally an ultramodern vehicle zips past them In the
sky above is another sea -- of advertising dirigibles
holographic billboards hovercrafts skim-jet transports

On one of the holographic billboards giant words begin to
flash I LIKE MIKE

Then a picture of the smiling President appears Then the
words RE-ELECT PRESIDENT MIKE BILLINGS FOR ANOTHER FOUR
YEARS KEEP THE PAST IN OUR FUTURE

INSIDE ANDERSONS CHEVY

Through his windshield Anderson glances at a holographic
road sign

THE ROAD SIGN reads FBI Headquarters 1 mile CIA
Headquarters 15 miles PRECRIME Headquarters 2 miles

Anderson goes back to his papers

INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS

Anderson sits in a too large office in a too large chair
He abruptly rises and begins to pace The room is large
but he paces like a lion confined in a cage

He punches an intercom A female VOICE responds

INTERCOM VOICE
Yes Director Anderson

ANDERSON
Wheres Ennis Page Why hasnt he
delivered this mornings Precog discs

Ed Witwer opens the door to the office and casually walks
in

INTERCOM VOICE
Ill find him sir

Ed shakes his head smiles

WITWER
Bullying the staff again Director
Anderson

ANDERSON

Screw you
Anderson turns away and stares out a large window Witwer
joins him

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Was that fun for you yesterday

WITWER
The Johnny Palmer bust

ANDERSON
Yeah

WITWER
It was okay We got our man

Anderson takes a long breath

ANDERSON
When do we not get our man

They turn as Ennis PAGE 44 a thin tight little man with
burr cut hair knocks and enters the room He carries a
black BRIEFCASE marked

Zone 218 - WashingtonAlexandria VA The case is cuffed
to his wrist

PAGE
Sorry Im late sir Precogs put
out a heavy national volume this

morning -- four for our zone
ANDERSON
(DISTRACTED)

Put the case on my desk Ennis

Page hesitates doesnt do it Anderson moves quickly to
Page

ANDERSON (CONTD)
What was I thinking

Anderson leans over the BRIEFCASE A small panel recedes a
red laser scanner clicks on scans Andersons eyes BEEPS
affirmatively then clicks off The cuff on Pages wrist
falls open

Now Page puts the case on Andersons desk Page hesitates
Anderson and Witwer know just what hes going to do Page
reaches down unable to resist straightening a pile of papers
strewn on Andersons desk
Anderson and Witwer exchange knowing smiles When Page looks
up they try to cover but are not quick enough He frowns
tightly and heads for the door

Anderson calls after him

ANDERSON
Thanks Ennis

Witwer turns to leave too

WITWER
Now thats a guy who really cares

Witwer grins to himself as he walks out of the office

Anderson takes a deep breath and goes to his desk and opens
the briefcase Four small bright DISCS sit in rows He
removes one places it in a VIDEO MONITOR that lifts into
view from the center of his desk He sits back weary and
watches

VIDEO SCREEN

A young black woman stands in a hallway She stares at a
door gun in hand She opens the door enters a bedroom

She glides toward a bed where a man lies sleeping She
lifts the gun and fires it into his sleeping form

ANDERSON pops the disc jots down some notes pops in a new
disc

VIDEO SCREEN

A white woman stands at a stove cooking A man comes up
behind her slowly silently a necktie taut between his hands
He raises the necktie toward her neck

ANDERSON

Hes not watching the screen He is out of his chair now
looking out the window

INT PRECRIME MAIN LOBBY

A tour of Precrime is in progress like the public relations
tours run by present-day FBI The TOUR GUIDE a pretty
smartly uniformed woman in her twenties leads a group of
adults and children all with glowing nametags through the
building
TOUR GUIDE
Welcome to the main headquarters of

Precrime Smaller Precrime branches
are scattered throughout the United
States

The group follows the guide slowly through the lobby

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)
Precrime was established in 2030
with the harnessing of the remarkable
talents of the Precognitive mutants

She points cheerfully to a stubby little man MR HARRIS

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)
Mr Harris can you tell me how many
Precogs there are

MR HARRIS
Three Uh right

TOUR GUIDE
Thats exactly right A lot of people
assume there are Precogs in every
branch office

(MORE)

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)

But there are only three Precogs
right here in this building And
the information they give us we
send out to all the other branches

(beat)
And what is that information -what
do the Precogs do

An eager boy TIMMY has the answer to that one

TIMMY
They protect us

The guide tousles his hair

TOUR GUIDE
(chipper voice)
Thats right Timmy Because of the
Precogs youre going to grow up
murderfree Isnt that something

MR HARRIS
They ever wrong The Precogs ever
screw up when they predict a murder

The guide laughs tolerantly

TOUR GUIDE
Never sir Its an infallible
system The Precogs predict a
homicide and our Precrime police
then apprehend that future murderer
before the event occurs And right
next door is the Judicial Center
where we prosecute the
future murderers

TIMMY
Can we see the Precogs

TOUR GUIDE
No Im sorry That part of the
building is not open to the public
(beat)
Now if youll just step this way

She waves the group on toward an elevator
INT THE PRECOG CHAMBER

The chamber is an elaborate hypertech hospital constructed
for the maintenance of three beings -- the Precogs They
are triplets -- two of the Precogs are male one is female

Technicians swarm all over them like worker bees The bodies
of the Precogs are being tended to exercised cleansed
groomed

The head of each Precog is encased in a complex ornate HELMET
that seems to be an amalgam of organic tissues and bright
metallics The helmets pulse slightly and the surfaces

seem to flow and shift like oil on water

A network of micro-thin cables that are actually strands of
light rise Medusa-like from each helmet then centralize
into a single strand and connect to a massive mainframe
computer

The Precogs appear to be in suspended animation or in comas
They are absolutely still and limp -- except for their faces
Their faces are in constant motion the lips mouthing scenes
from murders only they can see Life for a Precog is an
endless cycle of death
CLOSE ON - THE FEMALE PRECOG

we recognize her fragile and perfect FACE from the opening
scene of the movie She floats in a glowing nutritive bath
Like her brothers she seems to be eternally young or
eternally old

The technicians lift her from her bath She is dried dressed
in a robe then guided into an over-sized throne like chair
Her brothers are guided into their thrones on either side

of her

Not once are their helmets removed What they feed into the
mainframe is too valuable It must be gathered twenty-four
unrelenting hours a day

INT A ROOM

Ennis Page sits in a room just off the Precog Chamber He
can see them through a large window He works a large
computer console the gathering point for the information
the Precogs constantly feed the computer

Perhaps every ten seconds a small DISC is released by the
computer and mechanically gathered sorted and placed -under
Pages watchful eye -- into a black case

ANDERSON is in the room standing quietly behind Page As

Director Anderson is authorized to come and go but from

his fussy movements its obvious Page sees anyone else in
the room as an intruder in his special domain

Anderson turns and looks through the window at the Precogs

ANDERSON
What would they think about if we
unhooked them

Page looks up from his work
PAGE
They dont think sir They just
see

Anderson is silent

PAGE (CONTD)
Theyre not even alive really

Anderson contemplates the scene nods to Pages words then
turns and walks out of the room as Page looks on
INT THE PRECOG CHAMBER

The female Precog sits in her chair Her eyes are open
She faces the window that looks into Pages main frame room
In the window we see Anderson leaving the room

The female Precogs eyes drift closed
DISSOLVE TO
INT COURTROOM - JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY

A trial is in progress The defendant is Johnny Palmer He
sits ashen at a table his DEFENSE ATTORNEY beside him

There are no jurors in the Juror BOX There is a JUDGE 55
and stern There are a few people in the public seats

The Precrime prosecuting attorney is Lisa Anderson She
wears a black robe and addresses the Director of Precrime
Anderson who sits in the witness stand

LISA
Director Anderson do you swear that
the disc you now present to the court
is the only and authentic disc of
the future murder of Carol Palmer by
her husband John Palmer

It is a ritual that they both have acted out hundreds of
times Anderson gives the rote answer as he holds up the
DISC

ANDERSON
Yes This is the only and authentic
disc of the event seen by the
Precognitive mutants and recorded by
the Precrime Division This is the
immutable evidence of the infallible
system

LISA

The murder of Carol Palmer will occur

ANDERSON
In one week -- June 16th 2040 at
1033 in the morning
Lisa steps back The judge reaches out and Anderson hands
him the disc The judge inserts it into a special video
machine on his desk Anderson steps down his ritual part
in this trial completed

A huge MONITOR comes to life behind the judge He does not
turn around to watch -- he has his own monitor

Johnny Palmer watches eyes wide We now see in detail
what we previously heard the Precogs act out in the beginning
of the movie

THE MONITOR

The Palmers family room Johnny reaches into Carols sewing
basket for the scissors Carol stands defenseless in front
of him Their son cowers in a corner of the room

CAROL
Johnny please --

JOHNNY
Johnny please Johnny please

CAROL
Youre scaring me

JOHNNYS SON
DADDY DONT DADDY

Johnny approaches his wife with deadly menace

JOHNNY
(considering)
I dont like you any more Carol

CAROL
(imploring)
Put the scissors down Youre scaring
me Please

We cut away from the monitor and stay on JOHNNY PALMERS FACE
as he sits at the defense table He winces at each terrible
exchange

JOHNNY (0S)
Oh Carol

CAROL (0S)
Johnny Stop

JOHNNY (0S)
Dont grab at me Let go

JOHNNYS SON (0S)
Daddy No

Johnny Palmer cries out as the MONITOR goes blank

JOHNNY
I didnt do it Im innocent It
didnt happen

The JUDGE hits his gavel

JUDGE
How does the defense plead

The defense attorney glances at his watch then quickly
rattles off the words to his part of this judicial ritual

DEFENSE ATTORNEY
The defense acknowledges the
infallibility of the system We are
Guilty We throw ourselves at the
mercy of the court

JOHNNY
No No The Precogs are wrong No

The court guards are on him in an instant They lead him
out of the courtroom

INTA BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY

Anderson pushes down a tight hallway thick with police and
enters a disheveled room The fifties interior is drab a
Formica table bad curtains a frayed Lazy Boy positioned in
front of a TV

Ed Witwer is already on the scene He stands a few feet
from the BODY of a man gunshot wound to the head a handgun
on the floor nearby

WITWER
(to Anderson)
Looks like the old days

Anderson nods to his former partner Anderson leans over
the body

ANDERSON
That would be bad news for an
infallible system

Witwer is suddenly bored

WITWER
We know it cant be a murder -- the
Precogs wouldve seen it Why do
you insist on coming to these things

ANDERSON
Keeps the system honest And besides
I like to pretend Im a cop

Anderson turns to an officer

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Whos got the Coroner

Another OFFICER steps forward with a large blue case

OFFICER
Right here sir

The officer places the case beside the corpse and opens the
latches Inside the case is a large metallic APPARATUS the
Coroner

It comes to auto-life and begins to unfold itself - It rises
crab-like and steps out of its case

Except for his mouth the doctor doesnt move His projected
image stands beside the body his arms folded behind his
back He is the interface the way the humans communicate
with the crab apparatus

ANDERSON
Hi DOC

HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
Hello Director Anderson

The coroner crab begins to walk the body which is face down
on the floor It moves slowly hesitating as it crawls the
bodys back to insert various razor thin probes and core
samplers through the shirt and into the spinal cord

WITWER
This a homicide Doc

HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
Im presently analyzing neurohormones
Assistant Director Witwer I have
not concluded my examination

The crab engulfs the back of the head probes the wound

HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONTD)
Im detecting carbonization of skull
fragments around the entry wound

Witwer whispers to Anderson

WITWER
Bingo The guy put the gun to his
own head

HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
I have not determined that yet
Assistant Director

Witwer grins

WITWER
You have good ears for a ghost Doc

The coroner crab steps away from the body

HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
Please rotate the corpse to the
lateral supine position

Two officers turn the body face-up The crab inches close
to probe the face Disconcertingly it lifts the eyelids
and examines the interior of the mouth so that for a moment
the manipulation makes the corpse seem alive

Then the crab moves down the trunk and the legs At last it
comes to a standstill The holographic Doctor closes his
eyes as if in thought

WITWER
Can you imagine if this was a
homicide Who even knows how to
hunt down a killer any more

Anderson gives him a hard look

ANDERSON

I know how dammit You know how
WITWER

Easy partner

(beat)
But you know what Im saying The
state legislatures are pushing to
stop funding for training homicide
detectives

ANDERSON
God bless the Precogs
The Doctor opens his eyes

HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
This event is a negative homicide
A mortal wound was generated by a
-22 calibre bullet self-delivered to
the parietal portion of the skull
on June 10th 2040 at 1157 pm
(MORE)

HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONTD)
Eastern Standard Time This event
is a positive suicide

The holographic doctor begins to shimmer then disappears
back into the coroner crab The crab crawls back into its
case folds its probes and legs tight to its metal body and
shuts down

Witwer turns to Anderson
WITWER
Its time to stop coming to these

partner

Anderson watches as the med techs lift the body onto a

stretcher
ANDERSON
Yeah Youre right
INT A BANQUET - WASHINGTON DC -- NIGHT

Anderson in black-tie with Lisa in a shimmering blue gown
at his side moves through a huge room filled high level
government officials and politicians

ANDERSON
A little bit of me dies every time I
come to one of these things

LISA
Its only a party Paul

ANDERSON
Id never have let them appoint me
to Precrime if Id have known this
was going to be part of it

LISA
Youre exactly what Precrime needed
An amazing homicide cop and a real
person in an unreal job

ANDERSON

Exactly

LISA
The public loves the
Precogs But they give people the
creeps too Youre something they
understandp a regular cop running
things

Anderson sighs as he looks around the elegantly appointed
banquet hall

ANDERSON
Lets invite all these irregular
assholes over for a barbecue Burgers
and beer - think theyd come

A barrel-chested man with a great shock of pepper gray hair
SENATOR MALCOLM 58 takes hold of Andersons elbow from
behind

SENATOR MALCOLM
Id come Mr Director And Id
make all the other assholes come
with me

Lisa reddens Anderson gives an embarrassed cough The
Senator laughs and claps him on the back

SENATOR MALCOLM (CONTD)
Nice job this morning Another
negative homicide The Precogs never
let us down

Mrs Malcolm smoothly occupies Lisa while the Senator eases
Anderson in the opposite direction

SENATOR MALCOLM
I have a dream Paul

ANDERSON
I know you do Senator

SENATOR MALCOLM
Hundreds of Precogs Not just
predicting murders but predicting
all crimes Burglary arson assaults
ANDERSON
How about jaywalking Littering
Now theres a crime

The Senator smiles through his teeth

SENATOR MALCOLM
I dont want a police state you
know that But we have an opportunity
here and

ANDERSON
No sir we dont have that
opportunity There are only three
Precogs Theyre a lucky accident
of nature There are no more

SENATOR MALCOLM
(beat)
We can make more Just give me your
support Help me increase funding
for the Precog Engineering Project

ANDERSON
Precogs arent sheep or pigs Seeing
into the future is a gift a
nonreproducible event

(MORE)

ANDERSON (CONTD)
There was only one Mozart and there
are only three Precogs

SENATOR MALCOLM
Fuck Mozart The people want to be
safe They want that more than they
want food or love

He gestures at the room full of glittering partygoers

SENATOR MALCOLM (CONTD)
Look at us -its 2040 and weve
wrapped ourselves up in the 1950s
like a big security blanket Why
Because we want to feel like they
felt Safe

ANDERSON
Senator a world filled with hundreds
of Precogs is not my idea of a safe
place
The Senator gives it one last shot

SENATOR MALCOLM
Sure could use your help Paul

ANDERSON
I decline Senator Im sorry

SENATOR MALCOLM
(icily)
Dont think Ill come to your barbecue
after all

The senator moves off Anderson stands stiffly among the
sea of black-ties and exquisite fifties dresses

INT PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE MD DAY

Anderson walks through the lab with a tall pale man DR
RESFIELD 60 the head scientist It is not a place that
warms Andersons heart

Biotechnicians work at long stainless steel tables dissecting
and examining protoplasmic tissue masses Other technicians
peer through massive microscopes Still others use robotic
arms to manipulate radioactive organics behind leaded-glass
barriers

DR RESFIELD
You dont get out here much

ANDERSON
Not my sort of place

Dr Resfield emits a dry little laugh

DR RESFIELD
The head of Precrime squeamish

ANDERSON
When it comes to needles and scalpels
yeah

DR RESFIELD
I promise we wont use any on you

ANDERSON
What do you use them on

DR RESFIELD
(beat)
On bits of this and that

Anderson looks at him The doctor pauses outside a thick
door An IdentiScan device quickly reads their eyes and
the door opens with an electronic hiss

Anderson looks around the lab Technicians lower mesh
cylinders into some sort of chemical VAT Another technician
turns a dial and an electric charge courses through the
roiling liquid

ANDERSON
Whats happening here

DR RESFIELD
Were in an interesting phase

ANDERSON
Whats in the cylinders

DR RESFIELD
Neurotissue

ANDERSON
From

DR RESFIELD
A fusion of sources From the
Precogs deceased mother From the
Precogs themselves

ANDERSON
A fusion of

DR RESFIELD
In lay terms we mated sperm from
the brothers with ova from the mother
and sister to create new growth

The CYLINDERS shudder as the voltage is increased

DR RESFIELD (CONTD)
And then we add mutating variables

Anderson stares into the roiling vat Dr Resfield waits
for more questions But it is clear from Andersons
expression he has already learned enough

INT ANDERSONS OFFICE -- DAY

Anderson sits in his office reviewing Precog discs for
premurders in the local Washington area We stay on him as he
watches the monitor He pops the disc jots down some notes
slides in the next disc

Andersons mouth slowly opens He leans close to the monitor
his face ashen

EXT FRANK DIGNAZIOS BACKYARD -- LATER

Frank is on his hands and knees working his vegetable garden
He whistles softly under his breath as he trowels the rich
soil

He sits up as he hears someone open the garden gate He
lifts his straw hat in greeting gives a smile Its
ANDERSON

FRANK DIGNAZIO
What are you doing playing hooky

Anderson tries to smile But it wont come He looks around
the abundant garden

ANDERSON
Its great out here Frank You got
the touch

Frank straightens with a grimace

FRANK DIGNAZIO
I got the arthritis is what I got

Anderson reflexively looks up at a high WHINING sound from
over head Frank follows his gaze A Precrime HOVERCRAFT
glides into position overhead

Frank stares then lowers his eyes to the ground He takes
a long sad breath

FRANK DIGNAZIO (CONTD)
Ah shit neighbor

(beat)
Goddamn Precogs dont miss a beat
do they

(beat)
Can we do this inside Ellies not

home

Andersons voice is full of pain

ANDERSON
Sure Frank Yeah
INT FRANKS KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Frank wanders the kitchen trying to focus on his situation
Anderson has trouble meeting his friends eyes

Through a window we can see black suited police officers
with mirrored helmets swarming outside Franks house

FRANK DIGNAZIO

(distracted)
I thought Id buried it all
Thirty-five years -- all those minutes
and days to bury it

(beat)

But suddenly you see the man who
murdered your daughter walking the
streets -- my God it throws you

Frank stops pacing He stares at a kitchen drawer

ANDERSON
Hed served his time Frank I know
its not fair Its way beyond not

fair
Frank looks At Anderson bitterly

FRANK DIGNAZIO
(yells)
God damn the Precogs You know
Why couldnt they have been around
to save my girl
(softly)
Now theyre catching me

Frank reaches into the drawer and pulls out a small handgun

FRANK DIGNAZIO (CONTD)
I really shoot the bastard huh
When

ANDERSON
Next Wednesday at noon

FRANK DIGNAZIO
Good

Andersons cop eyes are all over the gun

ANDERSON
Its not in you Frank to kill
anybody
FRANK DIGRAZIO
Tell it to the Precogs Its set in
stone now right

Frank puts the gun on the kitchen counter Anderson relaxes

FRANK DIGNAZIO
(almost inaudible)
I dont want to be a part of this
world anymore

ANDERSON
I know Frank

Frank gives Anderson a look -- no friend you dont know
Then Frank looks hard at the gun on the counter

FRANK DIGNAZIO
(beat)
So Tell me Paul Do the Precogs
see everything

ANDERSON
No

FRANK DIGRAZIO
Then they wont have seen this

Frank suddenly snatches up the gun and presses it to his own
head On Andersons anguished FACE at the SOUND of the gun
going off

EXT FRONT YARD -- LATER

Anderson stands with his old partner Witwer on Franks
front porch Behind them through an open door we see Lisa
comforting Ellie DIgnazio in the living room

Anderson is deeply shaken Witwer tries to talk him through
it

WITWER
(GENTLY)
We had to bring him in

Anderson doesnt respond

WITWER (CONTD)
He was a future murderer

ANDERSON
(angrily)
You blame him The guy killed his
daughter

Witwer lets the implication of his words sink in

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Yeah I know I know

Anderson turns and watches as they wheel Franks draped body
into the back of an ambulance Andersons bitterness erupts

ANDERSON (CONTD)

I hate the Precogs Ed I believe in
them absolutely and I hate them
absolutely Jesus

Witwer listens to him

ANDERSON (CONTD)

And that goddamn lab trying to grow
more of them Put a Precog in every
home you know So we can have more
Franks - people shooting themselves --
over who knows what

Witwer kneads Andersons shoulder talks to him in soothing
tones like youd calm an agitated horse

WITWER
Precrime did the job it was supposed
to do

The two men can hear Ellie sobbing inside the house

WITWER (CONTD)
You know it And you believe in it

ANDERSON (BEAT)

Yeah

WITWER
Its not easy It beats us down
Ellie in there -- no doubt she hates

you right now
Anderson turns to Witwer
ANDERSON
Thats why I got into this business
-- to be hated

Anderson almost manages a small smile Witwer puts his arm
around him Walks him away from the scene

WITWER

They hated us when we were regular
cops Now were Precrime and they
still hate US Its one of the little
perks of law enforcement nobody knows
about

Their quiet laughter is tinged with sadness Anderson looks
into his partners good open face Then they both look
away their understanding of each other complete

INT ANDERSONS BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT

Anderson stares out the window at Franks house illuminated
by the moon Its a mournful sight

Lisa rises on an elbow and watches him from the bed
DISSOLVE TO
INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS-ALEXANDRIA-DAY - ONE WEEK LATER

Ennis Page in the mainframe room just off the Precog Chamber
picks up a black BRIEFCASE marked Zone 218 Washington
Alexandria VA He approaches the door and his eyes are
scanned The door opens with a HISS

We follow Page as he walks through doors and corridors until
he reaches a long hallway leading to the Directors office
Andersons secretary Angela looks up on Pages approach
She nods He nods

He walks around her desk His eyes are scanned and the
door to Andersons office opens

ANDERSON looks up wearily
INT ANDERSONS OFFICE -- LATER

Anderson inserts a disc into the video monitor almost
absently As we have seen him do before he swivels his
chair away from the monitor and stares at Washington DC
across the Potomac Hovercrafts and transports skim through
the sky above the Washington Monument

The camera stays on Andersons back as the sound from the
Precog disc begins He hears his own voice speaking in

strained agitated tones

ANDERSON (0S)
Lets not do this Ed

Anderson slowly swivels around and stares with disbelief and
horror at the monitor

THE MONITOR

shows Anderson and Witwer in a room a few feet apart pointing
guns directly at each other Their eyes intense and panicked
Who murders whom

Eds eyes cut to a huge digital clock on the wall as the red
seconds tumble away

ANDERSON

Witwer lowers his gun He stands unresisting before

Anderson

Witwer sees his own death in Andersons wild eyes has always
seen it

Anderson FIRES his weapon puts a bullet straight into
Witwers heart throwing him back against a wall Witwer
slumps dying beneath the huge digital clock which reads

520 AM
BACK TO SCENE

Anderson stares as the monitor fades to a blank His hand
goes to his mouth His body begins to shake He hugs
himself but he cant stop the shaking

The DISC pops out of the side of the monitor It is a small
SOUND but it has Anderson up and out of his chair as if it
were a gunshot He reaches for the disc but cannot touch it
His legs suddenly weaken and he drops to one knee beside

his desk like a man in need of prayer

There is a single thought that screams through his brain
It is an almost visible thing filling the room blackly
Anderson whispers the sickening words that shape his fate

ANDERSON (CONTD)
I kill you

(beat)

Oh god I kill you

As Anderson pulls himself up and tries to reach again for
the disc
CUT TO
INT THE PRECOG CHAMBER

In an image just like the scene in the beginning of the movie
the three FACES of the Precogs hover in the misty darkness
Their closed eyes open in SUDDEN UNISON They speak as one

ALL THREE
Murderer

After a long moment the eyes close again and the Precogs
fade into the mists

CUT TO
INT ANDERSONS OFFICE

Anderson looks up sharply at the SOUND of a knock on his
door Every normal sound seems grotesquely AMPLIFIED the
traffic outside his own breathing

His senses are on overload

The door begins to open A stockinged leg is the first thing
Anderson sees His secretary ANGELA

ANGELA
Sir

She hesitates before fully entering the room Anderson grabs
at the incriminating disc He sees his EYES reflected in
its alloy surface He pushes the disc deep into his pants
pocket

Somehow he finds his voice

ANDERSON
Come in Angela

She looks at him uncertain Then she places a small stack
of papers on his desk

ANGELA
Need you to sign these And your
eleven oclock starts in five minutes

ANDERSON
My eleven
ANGELA
(beat)
Budget coordination with the FBI
(beat)
You okay sir

Anderson runs his hand through his hair cant think fast
enough He sees her glance at the black Precog disc case
He shuts it awkwardly and it auto-locks

ANDERSON
Have Page take this

Angela steps back disturbed

ANGELA
But sir the procedure

ANDERSON (SNAPS)
I make procedure Call him
(long beat)
Im not okay Angela youre right

My head and stomach Im going down to the clinic Or maybe
just home

Angela looks relieved at the explanation

ANGELA

He moves past her His FINGERS fidget against the hidden
disc in his pocket

ANDERSON
Ill speak to Witwer put him in
charge for the rest of the day

He hesitates at the door turns to look at his office and
at his view of Washington Then he is gone

INT OUTSIDE WITWERS OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

Anderson looks in the door Of Witwers empty office He
takes a step inside

Witwers booming voice sounds from behind him startling
him

WITWER
Breaking and entering Thatll get
you five to ten hard
Witwer immediately scans his old partners ashen face

WITWER (CONTD)
Whats wrong

Anderson can hardly bear to meet his friends eyes He
REACHES into his pocket as if to lift the disc into the
light If he could just do that show it to Witwer

WITWER
Paul

Andersons hand comes out of his pocket EMPTY

ANDERSON
Take over for me today

WITWER
You sick

ANDERSON
Yeah

Witwer makes a show of backing away

WITWER
Dont give it to me You probably
have that Trans-10 virus going around
A stomach thing I hate stomach
things

Anderson Almost smiles

ANDERSON

WITWER
Yeah

Witwer looks at him Anderson almost reaches out for him

ANDERSON
Run the place okay

WITWER
(smiles)
Sure Right into the ground
(beat)
Go on home before I call Infectious
Control and have them spray you down
with something
Anderson moves unsteadily down the hallway Witwer calls
out

WITWER (CONTD)
You want me to do the discs or hold
them for you to review when you get
back

ANDERSON
Cant let them back up Do ‘em

WITWER
Call you later Take it easy all
right

Witwer lifts his hand in farewell Anderson fixes on that
last image -- Witwer waving goodbye

INT PRECRIME UNDERGROUND GARAGE -- LATER

Anderson sweating now leans against a thick cement pillar
and pulls out a cell phone He hits a button

INTERCUT BETWEEN ANDERSON LISA AT THE JUDICIAL CENTER

Lisa sits in a meeting Her phone CHIRPS softly She glances
at the display then rises to take it She goes to a corner
of the room

LISA
Paul

ANDERSON
Listen to me

Lisa presses her phone close to her ear

LISA
I can hardly hear you

ANDERSON
Im underground Weakens the signal
so it cant be picked up

Alarm moves across her face

LISA
But were on Secure

ANDERSON
Listen dammit Im going to murder
Ed
The Precogs picked it up
On Lisa -- can she have heard right

LISA
Paul Paul His crackling voice
faintly comes through the phone

ANDERSONS VOICE
home

Lisas phone goes dead
BACK TO ANDERSON

Anderson looks down a long row of parked Precrime ground
transports They are sleek and menacing the black shells
lumpy with dangerous gadgetry In the distance a POLICE
OFFICER holding an armful of equipment opens the back of
one of them

He looks up at Andersons approach He puts his equipment
down and salutes

POLICE OFFICER
Hello sir

Anderson nods moves close

ANDERSON
Whats your name officer

POLICE OFFICER
Bob uh Robert Smythe

ANDERSON
These the new Python transports

The young officer turns and looks at the transport with pride
is about to speak when Anderson touches a palm-sized Nova
stun gun to the base of his neck

ANDERSON (CONTD)
(sincerely)
Sorry Officer Smythe

The officer buckles Anderson catches him rolls him gently
into the back of the transport

Then Anderson quickly reaches into the transport and begins
stuffing equipment into a duffel bag a helmet and black
uniform the weapon-glove a folded rifle a holographic
scanner and other equipment whose function we can only guess
at

Anderson looks up at a sound echoey FOOTSTEPS They
approach then fade away

Anderson places the officers hands and legs together then
aims a nozzled cylinder at them He shoots a spray of blue
BindFoam chemical restraint sticking the man to the floor
of the transport in an adhesive glob

Then he leaves the scene running

INT ANDERSONS CHEVY

Anderson grips the wheel of his Chevy driving down 1-95

The fact that he cant control his car -- that the steering
wheel has no function his speed is predetermined and his
direction is guided by satellite -- is maddening now

From inside the cars that glide along beside him people turn
and look curiously at the man who is actually gripping his
steering wheel

Anderson slams it with his fist Through his windshield
Anderson sees a four year old boy in the drivers seat of a
passing red and black Ford His mother sits in the
passengers seat blithely reading The boy mimics Anderson
gleefully slams his steering wheel too then laughs

Anderson turns and looks the other way into the distance

at the Sprawl the vast unzoned city attached to Washington
DC You can see it in his face a man could lose himself in
there

EXT POTOMAC PARK

Anderson stands on an embankment He holds the Precog disc
in his hand ready to throw it into the river

He stands like that and then slowly lets his hand drop
He doesnt do it

INT ANDERSONS HOME - SUBURBS -- LATER

Lisa enters the house in a rush Every shade is drawn
Paul Anderson sits in an overstuffed chair absolutely
motionless like a man who has died suddenly

ANDERSON
Dont move
Lisa doesnt get it She continues toward him

ANDERSON (CONTD)

Stop Moving heats you up

makes it

easier for them to pick you up on

their thermals

She looks at him scared stops in her tracks She is

suddenly suffocating

LISA

Its a hundred degrees in here

ANDERSON

I turned the furnace all the way up

Your hair dryer The oven

If they

come itll buy me twenty seconds

Maybe thirty

LISA
Nobodys coming for you

Anderson stares at her

LISA (CONTD)

On the phone -- what you said Its

impossible

She shakes her head in disbelief Anderson speaks choking

on the words

ANDERSON

Im going to kill Ed Witwer

LISA
Its not true

Andersons right hand hangs over the side of his armchair
We see the bright DISC cupped in the palm He seems about

to reveal it to her but doesnt yet

He keeps staring at

her intently Something is holding him back

LISA (CONTD)

Youre upset Youve been unhappy
Theres a lot of pressure on you

And then Frank

ANDERSON

One week from today Tuesday June
25 at five-twenty in the morning

I shoot him Lisa

LISA
(beat)
You need to take time off
Anderson laughs harshly

ANDERSON
You dont have to worry about that

She steps toward him

LISA
(gently)
I want to hold you

ANDERSON
If you love me stand there And
dont move

Tears well in her eyes

ANDERSON (CONTD)
I saw the disc Lisa I shoot him
In the chest And he dies Ive
watched a thousand murders This
time I star in one

LISA
Somethings wrong You wouldnt do
it

ANDERSON
The Precogs are never wrong They
emit a single disc The immutable
evidence of the infallible system

The room is terribly hot his words -- she begins to sway
unsteadily

Anderson focuses on her Her face Her hair

LISA
Well figure this out Well review
the system

ANDERSON
There is no review Theres only
the disc It Shows My guilt Theres
no defense

Her long hair He stares

LISA
You cant run Please lets --
A SOUND outside They both turn A deep silence The
furnace churns out heat And Anderson looks at Lisas hair
and finally understands

Slowly and very carefully Anderson slides the DISC back
into his pocket He rises from his chair For the first
time he goes to her reaches out and touches her hair

ANDERSON
Last week It was strange I watched
from the bathroom window You went
out in the backyard to make a call

She looks at him

ANDERSON (CONTD)
An appointment you said For a
haircut that afternoon

Lisas hand jumps to her hair

ANDERSON (CONTD)
You didnt get your hair cut You
went to the trouble of calling first
thing in the morning It was that
important

She reaches for him He pulls away

LISA
Stop it Paul please Youre
panicking Everythings going to
look wrong Youre going to distrust
everybody and everything now

Lisa implores him

LISA (CONTD)
You cant distrust me
(beat)
It was Ed I called

Anderson cocks his head

ANDERSON
Ed why outside Why lie about it

LISA
Stop being a cop and listen to me

A booming electronically altered VOICE suddenly penetrates
the walls of the house from outside
VOICE (0S)
Director Anderson There is no
escape

Anderson betrayed glares at his wife Shes frantic
LISA

Your birthdays tomorrow We wanted
to

But bes already on the move running for the upstairs

VOICE (0S)
Drop to your hands and knees and
stay there Precrime is entering
your house

Lisa screams as her front door is sonically BLASTED off its
hinges and a swarm of Precrime officers in mirrored helmets
hurtle in

LISA
Paul

They move past her and spread through the rooms and up the
stairs like a disease in fast motion

UPSTAIRS

Helmeted officers hold their gloved right bands palm out
scanning rooms for thermal presence

An OFFICER 1 steps out of a small room He speaks his voice
electronically altered

OFFICER 1
Hes got a hair dryer going Screwed
up my reading

The others nod

OFFICER 2
Were not picking up shit

They rush into rooms with increased urgency We follow
OFFICER 1 as he moves counter to the group and down the
stairs

He hesitates as he moves through the living room which is
awash in personnel Lisa stands against the wall pale and
shaken He looks at her for a long beat then steps over
the shattered door and out into the sunlight
OUTSIDE

Everywhere else in the neighborhood it is green and calm
But Andersons house looks like a waspss nest someone has
kicked Four Precrime hovercrafts are suspended above it
engines WHINING Black Python transports are all over the
street out in front and more keep coming

And everywhere on foot there are Precrime police OFFICER
I approaches a Python ground transport Another officer
guards it weapon out his head turning right to left He
settles on OFFICER 1s approach and raises his weapon

OFFICER 1 doesnt even break stride He walks right up to
the guard -- and then right through him A holograph decoy
OFFICER 1 enters the Python

INSIDE THE PYTHON

OFFICER 1 removes his helmet -- its Anderson And then
comes the moment of truth -- have they cancelled his
IdentiScan access to Precrime vehicles yet

A little scanner arm arches down from the visor and flashes
a red beam into his eyes Anderson presses his lips together
The Python turns on and a generated voice greets him

VOICE
Paul Anderson 0256 clear

Anderson grips the steering wheel But his time since it

is a law enforcement Vehicle the steering actually works
Anderson pulls out

FROM ABOVE as the Python transport slips away from the chaos
THEN HIGHER and we see that the direction the Python is
headed will take it from the green of the suburbs through
the white of Washington and into the dark of The Sprawl

INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

Ed Witwer sits alone in an antechamber He stares at an
oversized oak door then looks down at the floor

He runs both hands through his hair He is tired his eyes
weary lost
A voice comes over the intercom

VOICE
Enter now please Assistant Director
Witwer

Witwer pulls himself together and opens the door
INT A CONFERENCE ROOM
Witwer takes a seat at the end of a long table

Powerful men sit at the other end of the table SWANSON
sharp-boned the FBI Director CRONIN awl-like eyes the
CIA Director Senator Malcolm Chief Justice POLLARD whose
face reveals nothing Vice-President ALMER whose tongue
darts across his dry lips unsettlingly Unpleasant looking
men in an unpleasant mood

Cronin looks up from a printout hes been reading and stares
at Witwer

CIA CRONIN
The central question is Why does
Anderson want to kill Witwer

Cronin holds up the printout

CIA CRONIN (CONTD)
We checked your finances His
finances Nothing irregular you
dont steal from him he doesnt
steal from you You havent done
anything that he might have
discovered and vice versa

Swanson holds up another sheath of papers

FBI SWANSON
Personnel checks reveal no ambitious
coups planned by you to topple him
(beat)
Hes done nothing to you or you to
him

Witwer presses his lips together

VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER
You fucking his wife

WITWER
No
FBI SWANSON
HIS MOTHER HIS BROTHER

Witwer gives him a bad look

FBI SWANSON (CONTD)
Okay There we are

JUSTICE POLLARD
So you are friends partners and
soul mates Anderson has no motive

WITWER
I cant think of one
(beat)
Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs
are mistaken

Witwer looks away Jesus he wants out of this room

JUSTICE POLLARD
You dont believe that do you

WITWER
(barely audible)
No The Precogs are infallible

Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this

SENATOR MALCOLM
Youre goddam right So gentlemen
-screw the motive We got a
pre-murderer on the run and a nasty
little PR problem

The very powerful men level their unpleasant gazes on Witwer

VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER
And here is our solution You are
now Director Witwer

Witwer shakes his head starts to protest Almer silences
him with a raised finger

VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER (CONTD)
Precrime must demonstrate its
willingness to go after one of its
own Total impartiality

WITWER
Now look--
Cronin talks right over him

CIA CRONIN
The public must believe that every
future murderer is pursued with equal
vigor

FBI SWANSON
Therefore Precrime will put in charge
the man best suited to the job And
who would pursue a murderer harder
than his intended victim

JUSTICE POLLARD
You went after Anderson yesterday
-because it was right and because
you believe

Almer speaks with a tight irony

VICE-PRESIDENT ALMER
And your belief will certainly grow
stronger with each tick of the clock

Witwer looks at the men with thinly-veiled hatred But he
does not deny their words

JUSTICE POLLARD
Haw long will it take Director

Wiltwer takes a long breath concentrates his mind on the
task he cant avoid

WITWER
He knows Precrime of course And
the streets -- hes rusty but hell
remember how to work them Itll
come back to him fast Hes the
best

Witwer almost smiles Justice Pollards not smiling
JUSTICE POLLARD
Were not here to praise Caesar --

were here to bury him

Witwer looks at Pollard then lifts a finger and touches his
right eye

WITWER
He cant avoid iris identification
Every door he opens every ATM he
uses or taxi or transport he boards
-- hell get scanned

(quietly)
It wont take long to find him

The eyes that look back at Witwer are unblinking
EXT THE SPRAWL NIGHT

The unzoned city is full of 1950s iconography but it all
feels different than it did in the suburbs Where the burbs
were Ike the city is Joseph McCarthy

The fat Ramblers and Studebakers have a little grime on them
The womens dresses are tighter and more urgent the mens
suits have some shine at the elbows You look over your
shoulder here move faster and smile a lot less

And some streets you dont go on at all Andersons Python
moves down one of them He stops under a blackened suspension
bridge gets out Hes still in uniform He holds a duffel
bag

He starts to walk away from the Python then hesitates
Hes left the door open He shakes his head at his
sloppiness Goes back and shuts the door Walks away again

INSIDE THE CAR

Hes left a small DEVICE on the passengers seat Digital
numbers shoot by in reverse Something CLICKS

OUTSIDE THE CAR

Anderson continues walking away He doesnt look back as
the Python is engulfed in a miniature sun of heat and flame
Its not a gasoline powered vehicle -- so it doesnt explode
It just ceases to exist

EXT ORANGE DRY CLEANERS - -- NIGHT LATER

Through a smeared window Anderson sees racks of suits and
dresses hanging in clear plastic bags He gets to work on
the door

INT ANDERSONS HOUSE -- NIGHT

Lisa lies in her bed alone in the dark She listens to an
almost inaudible sound a high WHINE

EXT ANDERSONS HOUSE
A Precrime HOVERCRAFT floats high above her house a dark
moon in the low clouds

EXT ORANGE DRY CLEANERS -- EARLY MORNING
A worker stands in the back of the store puzzling over the
clean clothes piled on the floor It almost looks like a

nest like someone slept there

EXT SUBWAY LATER
Anderson in a blue suit and fedora carrying his duffel
bag stands on a subway platform He takes out a cell phone

dials a number He looks up at the SOUND of a train

The approaching MagLev train has a lit sign on its front
car 33rd Street Express

CUT TO
INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS

At Precrime they upload a MAP DISPLAY of the Express trains

separate red dots along its route

An OFFICER points at the dots and speaks to Witwer in a low
voice

OFFICER

to Witwer

Andersons train is just finishing off-loading passengers

The doors close and the train begins
helmeted Precrime officers flood the

One of them points

Anderson is visible through the window talking on his cell
phone

CUT TO
INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS
Witwer stares at the map The train has stopped at 20th

street But Andersons still talking He isnt getting off
-- hes going on to 33rd Street the last stop

Technician 2 presses his earphone close listens then calls
over to Witwer Witwer covers his mouthpiece

TECHNICIAN 2
We have visual verification -- hes
still on the train

Witwer gives him a thumbs up We STAY ON Witwer as he
listens to Anderson and watches his train move toward 33rd
on the MAP

ANDERSONS VOICE
I want to tell you something partner
You listening

Witwer nods Now the MAP shows all the Precrime units
swarming toward the 33rd Street subway station

WITWER
Yeah

ANDERSONS VOICE
I gotta do this I have to figure
this thing out
(beat)
But listen to me now If it was you
running Id come after you Ed

Witwer stares at the MAP at all the units hes sent after
his friend

ANDERSONS VOICE (CONTD)
Youre a cop And Ima future
murderer

(beat)

Do your job Ed Come after me hard
Because Jesus Christ I wouldnt
sleep or eat until I had tracked you
down and put a gun to your head

EXT 33RD STREET SUBWAY

Precrime officers pour down the stairs toward the train
platform

CUT TO
INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS

Witwer watches on the MAP at all the little symbols merging
together like a gameboard -- but this game ends in a reallife
confrontation between one man and an army of them

WITWER
You wouldnt shoot a cop would you
Paul
(beat)
Paul Paul

He looks urgently to the phone technician

TECHNICIAN 1
Hes still on the line

Witwer presses his ear to the phone He can hear the subway
make its STOP Then he hears a chorus of mechanized VOICES

-the voices of the Precrime police the SCREAMS of panicked

passengers

VOICES ON ANDERSONS PHONE
Police Everyone down on your hands
and knees
(then)
Oh shit

CUT TO
INTSUBWAY TRAIN
The Precrime officers aim the index barrels of their
gloveweapons at ANDERSON who sits blithely on a seat holding

his cell phone to his ear

Anderson begins to shimmer then dematerialize ghost-like
into nothingness He was a holographic decoy

What is actually there on the train seat is Andersons cell
phone Rigged to its mouthpiece is a tiny digital voice
recorder
CUT TO
INT 20TH STREET SUBWAY

Anderson trots up the stairs and safely out onto the streets
of The Sprawl

DISSOLVE TO

EXT STREET - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT

Every city has its underbelly If you lifted the fat dark
underbelly of The Sprawl this is where youd end up

The streets here feel like alleys clotted and tight There
are streetlights bright ones -- but the light dies at its
source never makes it through the sour air down to the
ground

The retro fifties look comes apart here The people that
you see -- and you only catch quick glimpses of them they
move like rats -- wear black mostly tight fitting
tech-fibers

ANDERSONS caught one of the rats a thin bald guy in black
Anderson has him pinned up against a wall Theyre having
some kind of exchange -- which consists of the guy answering
none of Andersons questions and Anderson pressing him harder
against the wall

Finally the guy does something odd He lifts a finger and
pulls down Andersons right lower eyelid Anderson lets
him Then the guy does the same on the left Has a long
look And then nods Anderson releases him and they go
off together

EXT AN APARTMENT BUILDING -- LATER

An oppressive brick thing on a side street The facade is
crumbling Nothing good happens in a building like this

The guy leads Anderson to the building then scurries off
into the night

INT ROOM -- LATER

A stained overstuffed chair in the corner a dreary little
kitchen with crusted dishes in the sink

But jarringly in the center of all this is a make-shift
hypertech medical setup a gleaming operating table an array
of lasers scalpels and surgical equipment an anesthesia
console

Anderson sits in a chair facing DOC DOC is a big man with
delicate fingers He sneezes then blows his nose hard into
a handkerchief

DOC
Got a cold

Anderson looks at him uneasily Its not just DOC -- its
the whole setup the needles and scalpels the medical thing
which Anderson truly does not care for Doc sneezes again
then looks up at his patient

DOC (CONTD)
Dont worry I could cut open your
chest sew a dead cat in there and
youd never get an infection Not
with the spectrum antibios Ill be
shooting into you

ANDERSON
Im not here for cat surgery Doc

Doc chuckles Then he waits expectantly

Anderson hands him a tiny opalescent card A preset cash
card DOC slides it into small console watches the numbers
flash up He frowns sighs

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Its all I could safely move

He waits Docs not thrilled but finally he nods

DOC
Yeah All right

Time to got down to business Doc walks over to a large
medical cabinet and opens the door Its full of EYES and
parts of eyes -- 611 A cryo-jars

Anderson tightens

DOC (CONTD)
You understand what I told you then
I cant just give you new irises
The Scanners will read the scar
tissue Alarms will go off
ANDERSOIN
Im a cop I know

DOC
I gotta take your eyes out

Anderson knows this too wishes Doc would shut up ANDERSON
Yeah

DOC (CONTD)
And put in new ones

ANDERSON
Yeah I get it DOC

Anderson rises up out of his chair and goes over to the
operating table He lies down

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Do me quick before I run out of here

Anderson lies there blinking up at the ceiling He listens
to Doc preparing instrument trays Its a bad sound

EXT THE SPRAWL -- DAY

The suspension bridge where we saw Anderson vaporize the
Python transport Witwer stands watching as a Precrime
techno-unit sifts through the white ashes

Witwer lifts his face to the acrid breeze coursing off the
Potomac Its a pose a track dog might hold nose up testing
the air for a scent

INT BOARDING HOUSE ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY

We cant see anything at first because Anderson cant see
anything either Hes in a deep post-surgical haze DOCS
voice comes to him Its warped and ugly

DOCS VOICE
Dont take the bandages off for twenty
four hours Youll go blind if you
do

Anderson makes an affirmative grunt Now we see his
surroundings even though Anderson still cant He lies in
a grungy bed his head and eyes swathed in white dressings
Doc stands over him

DOC
Youre in a room I had you moved
here a couple miles from my place
If they find you they dont find
me

Anderson grunts weakly

DOC (CONTD)
A guy will come in feed you once
(beat)
I juiced up the nano-reconstruction
around your new eyes cause I know
youre in a hurry

ANDERSON
(Fuzzily) )
Nano-re construction
DOC

Organic microrobots that reconstruct
nerves and blood vessels Itll
feel like fleas chewing on your
eyeballs Dont scratch

Anderson is already reaching his hands for his bandages
Doc forces them away

DOC (CONTD)
Im giving you a bonus might come
in handy Feel this

Doc takes an air-syringe out of his pocket and touches it to
Andersons hand

DOC (CONTD)
Its a temporary paralytic enzyme
Someone spots you you duck into an
alley shoot this under your chin

Doc presses the tip into the soft underpart of Andersons
chin Anderson jumps

DOC (CONTD)
The enzyme turns your facial muscles
to mush You wont look like the
same man

ANDERSON
Jesus

DOC
You tighten up again in about thirty
minutes Hurts like nothing you
ever felt Its vicious but
effective Ill put it in your bag

Finally Doc takes a small clock out of his pocket and places
it on a dresser beside Andersons bed

DOC (CONTD)
Im setting up a timer When it
buzzes tomorrow take off your
bandages and get the hell out of
here

Anderson groggy starts to say something else but then he
hears a door open and close and Doc is gone

EXT THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT

The Precrime presence mounts on the streets A couple of
units move past the boarding house but they dont stop

INT BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- DAY

Anderson sits in a chair his dressings like a blindfold
He looks like a hostage He is sweating Keeps reaching
for his dressings to scratch then forces himself not to

He speaks to someone we dont yet see The guy DOC said
would come

ANDERSON
Im hungry but sick to my stomach
(MORE)

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Guess I should eat
(Beat)
You gonna help feed me

Now the camera moves and we see who it is that has been sent
to help Anderson Its the rat guy the thin bald man
Anderson had roughed up the day before The guy has a bowl
of hot soup in his hands He stares contemptuously at
Anderson

ANDERSON (CONTD)
So how do we do this pal

The rat guy doesnt say a word He simply tips the hot soup
and it splatters down into Andersons lap Anderson cries

out in pain and surprise The guy walks out of the room

CLOSE ON- THE TIMER
Twenty hours gone by Four more to go
EXT THE SPRAWL

Precrime cops are shaking down any of the rats they can catch
looking for leads looking for anything

INT THE BOARDING ROOM

The TIMER shows one hour to go Anderson sits in a chair
squirming miserably His dressings are wet with sweat and
frayed and dirty at the edges where he has tugged and plucked
at them

ANDERSON
(to himself)
Fuck

He is this close to ripping the dressings off
EXT THE BOARDING HOUSE -- DAY

A Precrime transport stops Two officers get out One of
them sets up a large thermal scanner on the sidewalk and
does a read on the boarding house The other does a read on
a pawn shop and bar next door

The OFFICER 1 doing Andersons boarding house calls to the
other officer

OFFICER 1
Got 27 warm bodies in this place
What should it take three or four

Spiders

OFFICER 2
Do four Speed things up so we can
go eat

The Officer 1 opens the back of the transport and takes out
a box He removes four round BALLS They are silver as
big as billiard balls

He goes up to the boarding house gets IdentiScanned and
the front door opens He rolls the balls down a dark hallway

Then he goes back out to the transport and leans against
it bored He holds up an electronic clipboard and waits

for the data to come in

INT THE BUILDING
The BALLS roll about eight feet then suddenly come to
autolife as they spin They open like flowers -- flowers
with legs

CLOSE ON A BALL

A fist-sized Spider takes shape On its head is an IdentiScan
lens mounted on a thin metallic antenna

INT A ROOM

An OLD WOMAN sits at a card table eating a bowl of something
unidentifiable She looks up with annoyance as she sees a
spider scuttling across the floor toward her It makes a
CLICKING sound on the floor as it comes Shes poor living
in The Sprawl -- she knows the drill She continues to eat

as the SPIDER crawls up the leg of the card table She barely
watches as it moves past her bowl and toward her hand

OLD WOMAN
Its nice to have a little company

She smiles toothlessly at her joke The Spider hops onto her
am and inches up then moves across her shoulder It grips
her cheek lightly as the IdentiScan antenna reads her eyes

Then it leaps off her and onto the floor and CLICKS away
across the linoleum

EXT THE BOARDING HOUSE

The Precrime officer lifts his clipboard and checks a column
with his laser pen and waits for the next one

INT ANDERSONS ROOM

Anderson sits in his chair He cocks his head listening
His body tenses Something feels wrong

The TIMER shows ten minutes to go Blindfolded for a day
and a night Anderson has no idea how much time he has left
Three seconds four hours

A flattened SPIDER squeezes under his door Anderson tenses
as it CLICKS across the floor toward him

He knows that sound

Anderson stumbles up and out of his chair He starts to
grab at his dressings remembers Docs warning and stops
himself The SPIDER waits for him to settle then CLICKS
toward him again

Anderson moves around the room avoiding the Spider He is
dripping with sweat starting to breathe hard The Spider
comes faster Anderson crashes into a table brings it down
Falls across the bed

EXT THE BOARDING HOUSE

The Officer 1 squints at his clipboard One of the Spiders
is taking too long He adjusts his thermal scanner and
sees the heat outline of a man bouncing around a room

The other Officer 2 finishes reading the pawn shop and the
barroom then wanders over to Officer 1 They both watch the
screen

OFFICER 1
Stinking drunk

OFFICER 2
(beat)
Or a guy who doesnt want to get
read

INT ANDERSONS ROOM

Anderson forces himself to sit still because he knows the
consequences The Spider advances starts up his leg

The TIMER has not buzzed Anderson cant touch his dressings
The Spider moves across his shoulder and onto his face It
WHIRS and HUMS trying to adjust its antenna against the
dressings

EXT THE BOARDING HOUSE

The officers eye the thermal scanner as they reach for their
mirrored helmets getting ready to go in

INT ANDERSONS ROOM

The Spider crawls all over Andersons head trying to get
past the dressings for a read

Anderson has no choice None He starts to lift at his
dressing The Spider senses his cooperation freezes in
place

Anderson wants to scream He unwraps his head tugs the eye
pads away from his eyes He rips them off The Spider sits
on his shoulder waiting
Andersons eyes are tightly closed He opens them
ANDERSONS POV - BLINDING LIGHT

Light brighter than a magnesium burn brighter than a nuclear
flashpoint Light to buckle the knees and push the brain
beyond endurance

And though all this the faraway sound of a BUZZER going off
The TIMER has finally sounded Andersons open eyes are
streaming with tears but he has survived the moment

ANDERSONS POV - THE ROOM

It comes into slow focus The Spider all business reads his
eyes Then as if nothing unusual has occurred it jumps

off his shoulder and crosses the floor It flattens scoots
under the door and is gone

EXT THE BOARDING HOUSE

The officers see that the Spider has gotten its read They
pull off their helmets

OFFICER 1
Lets eat

They start putting their equipment back into the transport
INT ANDERSONS ROOM

Anderson stares at himself in a dusty mirror His new eyes
are tender and bloodshot And they are not blue like the
ones he was born with but a deep brown Anderson is exactly
the same and utterly different

He grabs his duffel bag and gets the hell out of there
INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

Lisa looking drawn and scared sits in Witwers office
Witwer isnt looking too well either

WITWER
They told me to move into Pauls
office I said fuck you very much

Lisa nods

WITWER (CONTD)
(softly)
I dont want to do any of this Lisa

LISA
I know I know that
(MORE)
LISA (CONTD)

(beat)
Everybodys got their reasons for
wanting you in charge So do I --
you wont bring him in dead

WITWER
Yeah But if he shoots a cop
(beat)
Which is what he does four days from
now isnt it

Witwers eyes imp involuntarily to a CLOCK on his desk

LISA
Hed never hurt you

WITWER
I know that But the other thing I
know is -- the Precogs are never

wrong

The words are leading them no place good They stop talking
and just sit there

INT THE SPRAWL

Anderson stands on a street corner waiting in line with
several people waiting for the NO6 Turbo Tram

The double decker Tram comes People get off then the line
starts to move forward as people get on

Anderson fidgets Hes last in line Each person gets
IdentiScanned as he boards Andersons putting his new eyes
to the test If the scan goes wrong hes positioned himself
to run

The woman ahead of him gets scanned pays her fare
Andersons turn Anderson goes up the steps and a red beam
reads his eyes

The Tram DRIVER glances at a monitor beside his steering
wheel then nods at him

DRIVER
Welcome aboard Mr Symington Plenty
of seats in the back

Anderson nods moves casually to the back But his jaw
muscles are flexing hard working off the tension
INT A WEALTHY HOME - SUBBURIAN WASHINGTON -- NIGHT

Senator Malcolm releases a self satisfied little belch as he
finishes off a late night whiskey in his panelled den He
wanders about admiring himself in the many political photos
adorning the cherry wood walls

Hes feeling cozy and safe the way rich people can afford

to No IdentiScan Spiders would ever be sent under his doors
No intrusions of any sort nothing that a coiffed secretary
or a loyal wife wouldnt announce before hand

Which is why he doesnt immediately understand the small
SOUND at ear level coming from just behind him Its a
metallic CLICK-CLICK He turns amiably His eyes instantly
widen and his knees buckle when he sees hes looking into
the barrel of ANDERSONS cocked gun

ANDERSON
Time to upgrade your alarm system
Senator

Senator Malcolm tries to regain his composure His fear
embarrasses him

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Your work-up of Witwer The Security
Panel wouldve done one
(beat)
Why do I kill Witwer

The Senator finds his voice

SENATOR MALCOLM
Theres no motive

ANDERSON
Theres always a motive

Anderson presses the gun to the Senators forehead He slides
the barrel tip back and forth across the Senators sweaty
skin It makes a greasy red mark

ANDERSON (CONTD)
I couldve come to anyone on the
panel But I picked you
(beat)

Of all the shits on that panel I
like you least of all So if this
gun goes off Ill feel bad but
not you know devastated
You can almost see a thought dawning on Senator Malcolm

And then shockingly he spits in Andersons face and turns
and walks to the other side of the den His tone is mocking

SENATOR MALCOLM
What the fuck was I worried about
You cant kill me The Precogs
wouldve seen it

Anderson realizes this too lowers his gun The Senator is
even laughing now For a moment Anderson does nothing then
he moves toward the Senator again

The Senator stands his ground smugly

SENATOR MALCOLM (CONTD)
Witwers clean Youre clean
Theres nothing No motive Kind
of like something Kafka wouldve
cooked up

(beat)
You like that cockroach Youre
fucked and youll never know why

The Senator is laughing hard now Anderson lets him

ANDERSON

Tell you something about the Precogs
Senator Theyre great on murder
But its the little things they fail
to see

Anderson hits the Senator so hard it bounces him across the
floor and into the cherry wood panelling Several of his
beloved photos crash down onto him

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Little things like that for instance

Anderson steps over him and walks out of the room
INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

Search and Command room Witwer stands there amidst all of
the technology speaking to a group of Precrime officers

WITWER
He hasnt shown up on one goddamn
IdentiScan in three days
No one says anything and then LIEUTENANT GLASER 30 speaks
up

LIEUTENANT GLASER
Hes found a room -- hes going to
sit it out

WITWER
Yeah except for holding a gun to
senator Malcolms goddman head in
his own goddman house last night
Andersons sitting it out
(beat)
Why hasnt he been scanned

The officers look at their shoes

WITWER (CONTD)
Why is he invisible Hes moving
around but he isnt being seen

Lieutenant Glaser tries again

LIEUTENANT GLASER
He’s beating the scanners

WITWER
No one beats the scanners

Witwer reaches up wearily rubbing his face and eyes with
his hands The fingers dragging across his eyes stop Then
his hands drop away and he looks at his men

WITWER (CONTD)
Hes done his eyes

LIEUTENANT GLASER
But the scarring always

WITWER
He went the whole way The crazy
bastard had his eyes removed New
ones sewn in

LIEUTENANT GLASER
That takes weeks to heal

WITWER
If youre prepared to go blind a
street surgeonll juice up the repair
cycle They dont give a fuck about
risk
Witwers eyes flick to a digital CLOCK on the wall Its
something he cant help doing now

WITWER (CONTD)
Hes going to do what it takes to
stay free -- if it blinds him maims
him or kills him

Witwers admiring smile makes his men very uncomfortable
INT KITCHEN - THE SUBURBS -- DAY

A mother places a carton of milk on a table in front of her
teenage son He pours it into his cereal bowl then puts
the carton down in front of him

Theres a flexible Vid-Screen on the side of the carton
about the size of a playing card AS the sleepy kid watches
the disposable Vid-Screen sparkles to life

Nothing unusual they always do that For advertisements
lost kids or in this case crime bulletins

A good one The kid straightens up

THE VID-SCREEN

A fully rotating mug shot of PAUL ANDERSON fills the screen
followed by vital statistics and details of the precrime
hes been charged with

The kid watches for a while then gets bored and pulls the
Dexi-Pops cereal box over and starts reading the back of
that

INT A LIVING ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY

A big man in a tee shirt lies on a couch a bowl of popcorn
perched on his belly He stares at a TV monitor thats the
size of a twin bed

TV

Andersons face fills the monitor The TV image is so big
that Anderson overwhelms the room with his video presence
Its like God coming to pay a visit -- even if you want to
avoid Him you cant

The big man with the popcorn tries to do just that He surfs
through a zillion channels but Andersons visage is
omnipresent
EXT THE SKY - THE SPRAWL -- DAY

Andersons face fills the skies too Witwer and Precrime
have pulled out all the stops

Advertising dirigibles float by with Andersons image on it
Holographic billboards with Anderson hover in the air There
are so many Andersons in the sky he seems to be part of the
weather a special type of cloud

People on the streets look up briefly interested then go
about their business

EXT A STREET - THE SPRAWL

One person who is paying deep attention to all this is
Anderson himself He stands on a street corner wearing
dark glasses and a fedora staring at a public video kiosk

VIDEO KIOSK

The mug shot of Anderson disappears and is replaced by a
Precrime SPOKESWOMAN

SPOKESWOMAN
The United States Supreme Court has
issued a special injunction allowing
the unprecedented public viewing of
former Precrime Director Paul
Andersons future murder of Edward
Witwer the current Director

ANDERSON
His mouth slowly opens He steps
back against a wall and slides his
hand into his pants pocket He looks
at the Precog DISC in his cupped
hand then quickly puts it away

He stares at the kiosk as people on the street begin to gather
around excitedly

CROWDS OF PEOPLE look into the sky in store windows at
other video kiosks They have the enthralled anticipation
of a mob at a public guillotining

SPOKESWOMAN
She continues her declamation

SPOKESWOMAN (CONTD)
The video you are about to see
generated by the Precognitive mutants
is the immutable evidence of the
infallible system

(reassuring smile)
Citizens are urged to call
1-800-PRECRIME with any information
that may lead us to the whereabouts
of Paul Anderson future murderer

ANDERSON
Shakes his head in confusion and
disbelief But he has the Precog
disc

The OLD GUY him nudges him

OLD GUY
This oughtta be good huh

VIDEO
KIOSK

And there it is Anderson and Witwer standing there pointing
guns at each other The whole thing just as we saw it before
All the way through to the fatal moment

ANDERSON
Oh Ed

Anderson shoots him Witwer slumps dying The video stops
And then begins to play all over again right from the start
the 1-800-PRECRIME number scrolling along the bottom of it
Call now Call now Call now

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Moves quickly through the crowds

INT BAR - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT

Ennis Page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so
full of cigarette smoke it doesnt seem capable of supporting
life But it supports the kind of life Page is interested
in

An emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool
beside Page He gives one shake of his head and she slides
away again His eyes cut to a group of females He waits
for the next approach

CLOSE ON PAGE

as a HAND reaches over his shoulder and places a Precog disc
on the bar in front of him Page makes a sound and tries to
jump away as if the disc is something lethal Which it is
in a way

Anderson presses him back down on his stool Sits next to
him Page stares at him scared Anderson looks straight
ahead as he speaks

ANDERSON

Ennis Page engages the services of
prostitutes because his relationships
with them compound his feelings of
selfloathing

(beat)
Direct quote from your psychological
profile -- the kind of shit I had to
know as your former boss

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Page is an obsessive-compulsive
Type Nine Another quote Niners
are great for the kind of work you
do -- keeping all those Precog discs
in order

You can almost see Pages heart slamming in his chest He
tries to hide it with tough talk

PAGE
I fuck whores and Im orderly so
what

ANDERSON

Somethings out of order Ennis
Deeply out of order

Page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar PAGE You got a
disc Anderson picks it up holds it tight in his fist

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Not A disc The disc When I went
home sick I stole it

(MORE)

ANDERSON (CONTD)
I took it with me Ennis I wasnt
sick I was running with the evidence
(lets that sink in)
So how is it that Precrime has one
too

PAGE
(utterly baffled)
You cant make copies

Anderson waits Lets Page work through it

PAGE (CONTD)

Its the basis of the system The
immutable evidence Copies are
impossible

(beat)
You went home A little later I
came in with a disc for Mr Witwer
to review I wasnt halfway out the
door when he cried out

Anderson is barely breathing hes listening so hard

PAGE (CONTD)

He was in shock He showed me It
was you shooting him Then all hell
broke loose He had to send the
Precrime units to your house

ANDERSON
Ennis -- you gave out the same disc
twice Less than an hour apart
The one I stole And then another
one Of the same event

PAGE
Its impossible The Precogs can
only move forward to new events
Into the future They never repeat

Anderson looks around Patrons are beginning to look over
in his direction eyes lingering He rises

Page seems in a daze As an obsessive-compulsive niner the
concept of an untidy system is disorienting

Anderson starts to say something to the man then doesnt

On the way out Anderson gets IdentiScanned An automatic
DIGITAL VOICE calls out after him

DIGITAL VOICE
Have a nice night Mr Symington

Anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of The

INT A STREET - THE SPRAWL -- DAY
A YOUNG GUY with a sparse moustache walks up to a payphone
He picks up the receiver and immediately gets IdentiScanned
A light goes on hes about to dial

Anderson appears out of nowhere shoulders him out of the
way The young guy drops the receiver and stumbles back
onto the sidewalk Anderson grabs the hanging receiver

YOUNG GUY
Hey Hey you cant

He reaches for Anderson then thinks better of it Anderson
is twice his size and very menacing in dark glasses

YOUNG GUY (CONTD)
Im gettin a cop

The guy scurries off Anderson dials quickly
INTERCUT ANDERSONLISAS OFFICE

Lisa walking down a hallway in the Judicial Center stops
to answer her BEEPING cell phone She leans against a wall
as lawyers and judges pass by

ANDERSON
Its me

LISA
Paul

Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall

ANDERSON
Your phone will be bugged So we
cant meet we cant do anything
Just listen Nowing youre listening
is enough

Lisa nods as if hes right there He is right there for
her This is all shes got

ANDERSON (CONTD)
When Precrime stormed the house I
thought youd called them Betrayed
me

LISA
No

ANDERSON
I know Witwer sent them He saw
the disc and had to do his job
(beat)
Tell me you forgive me Please
LISA
Of course I forgive you

Theres no time left He has to get off the line and start
moving again A vast weariness enters his voice

ANDERSON

All these people I need to forgive
me

(beat)
Do you think Frank forgave me All
I could do for him was send him
gardenias

(long beat)
I love you

Lisa almost cries out when he hangs up She flattens herself
against a wall She stays like that for a long moment
pulling the sound of her husbands voice his words deep
inside of herself

And then she gets a look as one of those words registers
profoundly

LISA
(whispers to herself
Frank hated gardenias

EXT EAST END CEMETERY - ARLINGTON -- LATER

A public cemetery along the Potomac Theres not much land
left for new graves A funeral is taking place A lot of
mourners in dark 1950s suits and dresses The service is
nearing its end

Frank DIgnazios newly dug grave is nearby Lisa stands
there looking at the temporary marker and the flowers and
wreaths piled up against it

Two rows over they are lowering the casket into the ground

High in the sky a PRECRIME HOVERCRAFT everpresent in Lisas
life floats in the low clouds with a barely audible WHINE

Lisa rests a floral arrangement against the pile of flowers
Her hand drifts near a white GARDENIA WREATH There is a
small envelope tucked beneath a blossom She takes it

Then she rises and begins to walk back to her car

The funeral is over and the mass of mourners many wearing
dark glasses fan out toward a long line of cars
One of the MOURNERS brushes past Lisa She looks up and he
tips his dark glasses down onto his nose and stares over
them at her

Its Anderson Isnt it She looks into his eyes And
its jarring the blue eyes gone that theyre brown now
But its him hes there and she wants to reach out for
him Knows she cant

Hes already moving on Hes risked everything for a look
He slips into the black sea of mourners she goes to her car
-neither of them ever breaking stride

The Precrime craft hovers unaware

Lisa opens the envelope as her car drives her down the
Alexandria-Washington ConnectWay

A Precog DISC falls into her hand Her mouth opens -- shes
never held one before

And there is a NOTE with it It READS

The Precogs generated duplicate discs This is the first
Precrime has the second Duplicates Why

EXT A CONVENIENCE STORE - THE SPRAWL -- DAY

Anderson has to eat bad food quickly and on the run He
gathers up a wrapped sandwich a bag of donuts something to
drink

He waits in line He doesnt like to be in a line waiting
The woman ahead of him argues about change He presses his
lips together

And then he glances at the mirrored surface of a hidden camera
DOME attached to the ceiling It gives him a fish eye
reflected VIEW of whats happening behind him

Precrime police are happening behind him He doesnt stop
to ponder as two Python transports zoom up outside the store

Anderson vaults the counter knocking the customer and the
clerk to the floor

INT BACK ROOM

Anderson plows over a guy filling a trash can He hears the
mechanically altered COMMANDS of a Precrime officer calling
from the store

VOICE
Paul Anderson Drop to your hands
and knees

Anderson crashes out into an alley and clambers up a fence
SONIC BLASTS shatter the air around him Chunks of brick

fly off the walls on both sides But he is full of
adrenaline and there is no stopping him

INT A TURBOTRAM - THE SPRAWL -- LATER

A different part of the city Anderson hunkers low in the
back seat of a tram

He looks up as the DRIVER swears

DRIVER
What the hell --

Anderson stands up looks down the aisle through the
windshield Precrime transports are heading straight at the
tram going the wrong way on a one way avenue

Theyve even taken radio control of the PA system on the
tram

VOICE
Paul Anderson Drop to your hands
and knees

Anderson cant believe it -- how are they suddenly pinpointing
him The passengers turn in unison like cattle and stare
at him terrified

Anderson grabs his duffel bag and kicks at the back exit
doors smashing them open and tumbles out onto the street

He rolls and is up on his feet in a second reaching into
his bag for a glove He pulls the weapon onto his right
hand as he whirls around sizing up his predicament

Precrime transports have begun to seal off both ends of the
street He looks up He is surrounded by skyscrapers and
buildings -- he is walled in at the bottom of an urban
canyon

People freeze against the sides of buildings run into
doorways where they can Passengers in trans and taxis or
cars stay there pressed against their windows watching
Nothing moves except the Python transports closing in
The lead officer speaks with that menacing electronically
altered VOICE

VOICE (CONTD)
Lower your weapon or we will

neutralize your threat potential

The Precrime police are out of the transports now advancing
at either end of the city street in phalanxes of men

Anderson eyes the side of the black granite office building
closest to him

ANDERSONS POV - A HIGH PRESSURE HYDRANT

The large red hydrant sits a few inches out from the building

Anderson almost smiles as he begins to walk slowly toward
it his weapon pointing harmlessly at the pavement

VOICE (CONTD)
Do not move

Anderson is up on the sidewalk now two feet out from the
building right beside the high pressure hydrant

He stops looks up looks down looks at the police advancing
It is a moment for prayer Anderson doesnt have a moment

He spreads his feet and fires a massive SONIC BLAST down at
the sidewalk The effect on the underground water main is
immediate

A GEYSER of water two feet in diameter erupts straight up
from the sidewalk lifting the tumbling Anderson fifteen
feet into the air right alongside the building

The stunned police officers try to take aim but Andersons
bouncing at the top of the geyser And they cant fire
anyway because officers workers stare at the excitement
from every window in the building

All this in a time span of seconds The world spins crazily
for ANDERSON but he manages to grip hold of a metal support

beam holding the buildings sign one story up

The police try to see what hes doing but the torrent of
water from the water main break obscures his moves

He pulls himself onto a ledge steadies himself slides along
it toward a second story window The office building gawkers
lurch backward from the window as Anderson blasts it to
sparkling dust and leaps inside

INT OFFICE BUILDING

The building covers almost an entire city block Anderson
dripping wet runs from one end of it to another blasting
through doors shoving terrified workers out of the way

He is like a wide receiver running the length of the field
jumping obstacles slamming through over and around whatever
he must to get to his goal

And then he reaches his goal -- the windows overlooking the
avenue next block over and parallel to the one where Precrime
ambushed him

He spots a double-decker TurboTram moving slowly in the stream
of traffic It pulls to the curb below to pick up passengers

Anderson blasts out the window and leaps onto the roof of
the bus It is a bone-jarring landing He loses
consciousness for a second rolls the length of the roof
and slides off it onto the pavement

He lies there trying to rouse himself Traffic brakes to a
stop automatically as car and truck sensors read his form in
the road No one wants to touch him A single car horn
SOUNDS and then a chorus of them

Anderson rouses struggles to his feet and takes off ina
limping run

INT SUBWAY STATION LATER

Anderson out of breath and in pain leans against a post at
the far end of the passenger platform There are tracks on
either side of him one marked Uptown and the other
Downtown

He feels a blast of air and looks to his right and sees that
the Downtown train is coming in And on his left too the
Uptown train rounds the bend and comes into view

ich MagLev train will lead him to safety Which one wont
ey pinpoint He runs up to a teenage KID who has his arm
round his girlfriend They step back startled Hes got
flat top hair cut she wears a pleated skirt and saddle
oes

aoowocs

The trains pull in
ANDERSON
Pick one for me

KID
What

THEY TRY TO WALK AWAY

ANDERSON
Point to the train I should take
Please

KID

I dont know
The girl lifts a nervous finger and points The Uptown He
runs to board it as they run in the opposite direction to
the Downtown
INT SUBWAY CAR
He sits at the back of the half empty train watching the
dark rush by A train chosen arbitrarily -- its impossible

they could find him

A station Stop He starts to get off is actually on the
platform then steps back onto the train

The rushing dark again When the MagLev eases to a halt at
the next station he gets off this time

INT STATION

He walks toward the exit stairs with a handful of people
He eases back and lets them go up first

THE STAIRS

Precrime officers crouch around the bend silently snatching
people out of the way as they come into view They wait
-but Anderson does not come And he does not come

On signal the Precrime officers rush down the stairs

DOORWAY ABOVE THE STAIRS

ANDERSON hangs high above the doorway near the ceiling
adhered by one arm there by a blue glob of adhesive BindFoam

ANDERSONS POV - THE OFFICERS
as they run below him down the stairs They go out of sight
he can hear them rushing along the platform searching for
him

The strain of hanging by one arm is killing him He reaches
up With a laser knife and cuts away at his coat sleeve
releasing himself from the glob He drops to the stairs
and instantly slips up them

He surprises a helmeted OFFICER just around the bend He
slams HIM against the wall yanks off his helmet and holds
the laser knife against his throat

The OFFICER 1s clearly terrified He speaks hoarsely through
Andersons choking grip

OFFICER
Dont kill me Jesus Please

Anderson looks at the panicked officer Anderson closes his
eyes trying to put it together He opens them

ANDERSON
But the Precogs wouldve predicted
me killing you Youd know whether
I do or not

The officer looks at him with eyes begging for mercy
Anderson suddenly gets it He tightens his grip on the man

ANDERSON (CONTD)
They shut down the system Havent
they Theyve shut down the Precogs

The officer nods

OFFICER
Theyre off homicides Theyre
redirecting them to help us locate
you

Which is how they knew where hed be every time

Anderson chops quickly at the base of the mans skull
knocking him out And then he runs because what else can
he do

INT JUDICIAL CENTER -- DAY

Lisa stands in a long hallway outside a door labeled

COURTROOM 17 She holds a briefcase in one hand Down the
hall other courtrooms are in use but not this one She
enters the dark and vacant Courtroom 17
INT COURTROOM 17

Lisa sits at the judges bench in the empty courtroom The
lights are dim

She takes a small battery-powered tv out of her briefcase
She turns it on

TV

The murder of Witwer by Anderson is being shown over and
over in a continuous loop Flashing at the bottom is the
hotline number 1-800-PRECRIME Then- Call Now Call
Now

BACK TO SCENE

Now Lisa takes out the Precog disc Anderson gave to her -the
first disc

She places it in the specialized monitor on the judges bench

The tv and the judges monitor sit side by side The tv
plays the version of the murder from the second disc the
judges monitor plays the version from the first disc

She stares intently her eyes flicking back and forth from
one version to the other They seem absolutely identical
When the judges monitor goes blank she starts it over again

Lisa stares watching her husband murder his best friend
endlessly

EXT A GAS STATION - ALEXANDRIA -- DAY

A gas station right out of the fifties An attendant ina
uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield
of a sky blue Rambler

In the background Anderson walks toward a mens room

INT THE MENS ROOM

Anderson looks at himself in the mirror He reaches out and
touches one reflected eye which is a deep brown It is
still startling to him the color of his eyes

Then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air
syringe Doc gave to him He looks at it nervously It is
filled with 5 ccs of an opaque green liquid
He touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin
He closes his eyes Then he screws up his courage and hits
the plunger The liquid is pneumatically delivered with a
searing HISS

Anderson screams out in agony slams back against the wall
of the bathroom His hands reach up for his face -- which
looks like its boiling from within

ANDERSONS FACE

The skin on both cheeks begins to pucker The muscle tone
around his chin goes soft and begins to sag like an old
mans That is the effect -- like he is aging fifty years
His forehead wrinkles the skin under his eyes droop Healthy
pink is replaced by bloodless gray

AND MOTHER OF GOD DOES IT HURT
EXT THE MENS ROOM
The ATTENDANT knocks nervously on the door

ATTENDANT
You all right in there

When the door opens an unhealthy looking old guy with a
fedora hat pulled low comes slowly out of the bathroom
Anderson nods and walks past the attendant who watches
after him uncertainly as he wanders off

INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER

The perky tour guide we met earlier takes another group around
the headquarters There may be a massive campaign to find
Anderson but the Precrime public relations machine continues
to run without interruption

There are ten people in the group and the physically
transformed Anderson is among them They all wear glowing
nametags Andersons reads Mr Symington He keeps his
hands in his pockets and his head low

We have heard the tour guides spiel before

TOUR GUIDE
Welcome to the main headquarters of
Precrime Smaller Precrime branches

are scattered throughout the United
States
She is about to go on when she looks over at Anderson He
is fidgeting uncomfortably

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)
Are you all right Mr Symington

Anderson moves up close to her a little too close He
whispers to her embarrassed She gives him a professional
smile and points in the distance past the elevators

Anderson nods and heads off She calls after him

TOUR GUIDE (CONTD)
Well wait right here for you sir

INT A STAIRWELL
Anderson runs down a back stairwell to a lower floor
INT A BASEMENT CORRIDOR

Anderson stands outside a door marked Housekeeping Above
the doorway is an IdentiScan device

Anderson reaches into his coat and carefully removes a small
cryo-jar

CLOSE ON THE CRYO-JAR

Imbedded in the clear gelatinous coolant are two eyeballs
-the irises a luminous blue

INT SEARCH AND COMMAND -- MOMENTS LATER

The operations room in Precrime The technicians sit at
their computers and holographic tracking displays

Witwer paces among them His eyes keep flicking to the
digital clock on the wall Then they cut back to the men
and machines that are telling him nothing Witwer does not
look well at all When a TECHNICIAN leans close to his
computer monitorWitwer almost leaps across the room to get
to him He looks over the mans shoulder

WITWER
What is it

TECHNICIAN
Must be a glitch

WITWER
What
TECHNICIAN
Anderson just got IdentiScanned

Witwer grips the back of the technicians chair The
technician types the data through again

TECHNICIAN (CONTD)
Its him -- hes been scanned

WITWER
Where is he

The technician looks up at Witwer

TECHNICIAN
But hes had his eyes done Right
Sir Tries to think it through

WITWER
(barely audible)
He had to have

The technicians computer flashes the next piece of
information When he speaks its the last thing Witwer
wants to hear

TECHNICIAN
Jesus Christ sir Hes in the
basement of this building

All eyes turn to Witwer The unspoken question hangs in the
air Andersons come to murder Witwer

INT PRECRIME HEADQUARTERS

Throughout the building every available Precrime Officer
begins to receive orders to mobilize toward the basement

INT THE PRECOG CHAMBER

Four officers stand guard in the chamber They listen to
the orders coming in on their earpieces Three of the guards
rush out of the room one stays behind

The three Precogs sit in their oversized chairs the female
in the middle the males on either side of her Their eyes
are open and they are deeply alert

Two technicians tend to the Precogs At the back of the
chamber through a large window we see Ennis Page sitting
at the huge mainframe
INT SEARCH AND COMMAND

A ring of Precrime officers three men deep stand guard around
Witwer Witwer looks like he wants to kill them all

WITWER
This is ridiculous

Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully

LIEUTENANT GLASER
Standing orders from the Security
Panel sir

WITWER
If he wants to get to me hell get
to me

LIEUTENANT GLASER
No he wont sir

Witwer looks at the confident young officer almost pityingly
Then his eyes flick to the wall clock

INT THE BASEMENT

Armed Precrime officers clog the corridors conducting
defensive searches of one room after another All they are
coming up with so far are some very startled housekeepers

INT THE PRECOG CHAMBER

In the chamber are one guard two technicians and three
Precogs And all of them are left in sudden darkness as
the power is cut

INT SEARCH AND COMMAND

The officers around Witwer reach for their maglite
flashlights The Search and Command room suddenly looks
exceedingly vulnerable

A technician calls out from the darkness
TECHNICIAN

Dont worry air -emergency generators
will kick on in five seconds

The green glow from a roomful of wristwatches makes the room
seem alive with fireflies Five seconds go by Then ten
more

WITWER
Explanation please

TECHNICIAN
Uh sir It seems he got the
generators too

There is a long moment of silence And then Witwer begins
to laugh

INT THE PRECOG CHAMBER

The room is utterly dark and silent The silence is broken
by the SOUND of something rolling across the floor Somebody
speaks probably the guard

VOICE
Shit

An explosion of light fills the room in STROBE-LIKE blasts
And leaping through the light is ANDERSON The temporarily
blinded guard and technicians have dropped to their knees
Anderson stun guns them quickly

The strobes fade and Anderson sets a zirc-flare on the floor
We see that the enzyme is wearing off -- his facial features
are returning to normal

He is oblivious to the Precogs in their chairs It is the
equipment he is after

Through the observation window we see ENNIS PAGE watching in
horror as Anderson severs the light cables connecting the
Precog helmets to the mainframe

Anderson aims a sonic blast at the observation window blowing
it out and knocking Page unconscious Then he reaches into
the room and destroys the mainframe itself with a series of
blasts

Anderson is so intent on destruction he does not sense a
PRESENCE behind him Perhaps it is because the movement is
so completely devoid of malice it is beyond detection

A HAND the fingers pale and slender reaches out and takes
hold of his hand

Anderson whirls around weapon out And there before him
is the FEMALE Precog He looks at her then beyond her to
the other Precogs who are lolling in semiconsciousness in
their chairs

Her helmet is off She is young but her close-cropped hair
is silver white And when she speaks her voice is like the
wind whispering through time
FEMALE
Save us Anderson

Anderson can feel the seconds ticking away his carefully
planned operation interrupted in an unfathomable way

ANDERSON
I have to get out of here

She grips his hand

FEMALE
Save us

It is beyond pitiful this frail little woman pleading
And her eyes she wont let him go She is beginning to
weaken to sway on her feet

A sudden realization floods over Anderson

ANDERSON
You let me get here didnt you
You stopped giving them information
so they couldnt track me

The Precog female is fading fast She tries to reach out
for him and her legs give way

FEMALE
Save --
And what can Anderson do but catch her before she falls
What can he do but throw her over his shoulder and in the
fading light of the flare make a run for freedom

INT TUDICIAL CENTER

Lisa has been staring at the judges monitor and the tv screen
for over an hour The two versions of Anderson murdering
Witwer play over and over

LISA
(wearily to herself
Help me Paul

She hits freeze-frame on the judges monitor at a moment
during his confrontation with Witwer when Andersons FACE
fills the screen

Lisa looks with deep urgency into her husbands eyes

And it is his EYES finally that tell her everything Lisas
hand rises to her open mouth
LISA (CONTD)
Theyre blue

She keeps the image on freeze-frame and turns and looks at
the tv which shows Precrimes disc over and over the 1-800
number scrolling along the bottom

When the same close-up of Anderson flashes onto the tv screen
she leans close to it and squints

Anderson stares right back at her And for the first time
Lisa sees that the tapes are not exactly identical His
eyes

LISA (CONTD)
And now theyre brown

For the first time in days she allows herself a small smile
INT PRECOG CHAMBER

Power has been restored to Precrime Headquarters Witwer
walks slowly through the ruins of the Chamber EMT teams
work on Ennis Page and the other dazed personnel Anderson
has left in his wake

Technicians cluster around the two remaining Precogs the
brothers Their eyes are closed and they are limp Their
lips move soundlessly as if in conversation with each other

Lieutenant Glaser is with him but when Witwer speaks it is
almost to himself

WITWER
Why didnt the Precogs know he was
coming to do this

The Lieutenant has no reply Witwer runs both hands through
his hair It has begun to wear him down the ticking of the
clock

WITWER (CONTD)
The next time he shows up itll be
to kill me

LIEUTENANT GLASER
We wont let that happen sir

Witwer takes in the chaotic scene around him then gives the
Lieutenant a withering look
WITWER
You wont huh

When the Lieutenant tries to speak to him Witwer walks away
and goes over to the technicians working on the Precogs He
stares at the Precogs

WITWER (CONTD)
(to a technician)
When can we get these things
operational

TECHNICIAN

Theyre a hive mind sir It takes
three for their predictive abilities
to be fully operational

Which Witwer does not want to hear Witwer leans very close
to the technician

WITWER
These two are all I have to find the
man who is about to murder me Hook
them up and flood them with whatever
kind of fucking chemicals you have
to They are a machine and I need
that machine at my disposal

The Precogss lips stop for a microsecond and then begin
their silent movements again

INT ENNIS PAGES HOUSE - ALEXANDRIA -- NIGHT

Ennis Page is a man unglued He sits on a tidy little sofa
in a tidy 1950s style living room But his movements have
become untidy He puts a very tiny pill on his tongue

When he drinks from a glass of water it dribbles down his
chin onto his shirt Not like Ennis at all

When his doorbell RINGS he slowly looks up then looks down
at the floor again He doesnt answer it It RINGS some
more

And then Lisa is standing there before him

LISA
Your IdentiScan is off Ennis I
could just walk in here

PAGE
I forgot To turn it on
She sits down beside him

LISA
You dont look surprised to see me

She glances at the bubble pack of pills on the table beside
him three gone

LISA (CONTD)
I need your help

Unexpectedly tears well up in Enniss eyes

PAGE
He took one of my babies

LISA
Hes desperate Ennis He had to
(beat)
We have to help him

Lisa holds the Precog disc in front of his eyes He closes
them against the sight as if it were an evil talisman

LISA (CONTD)
Its a fake Ennis

Enniss eyes open again

LISA (CONTD)

This is the first disc You delivered
it to Director Anderson He reviewed
it And then he stole it and went

on the run

Ennis tries to think through his fear and haze His words

slur
PAGE
I delivered a fake to him
LISA
But he thought it was real and ran
with it
The pills his tidy world coming apart -- Ennis is losing
it

LISA (CONTD)
An hour later you delivered a second
disc of the same event Witwer
reviewed it It was real (Beat)
How do I know this

Ennis just wants her to go away He wants it all to go away
Tears stream down his face

LISA (CONTD)
Director Anderson had his eyes
changed They were blue Now he
has brown ones

Ennis is sliding away Lisa takes hold of him Makes him
listen dammit She points to the disc in her hand

LISA (CONTD)
This disc the fake one shows a
blueeyed Anderson murdering Witwer
two days from now He doesnt have
blue eyes anymore The person who
faked this disc had no idea he would
change his eyes

Lisa shakes him

LISA (CONTD)
Listen But the second disc has to
be real because he has brown eyes
when he murders Witwer

(MORE)

LISA (CONTD)
(beat)
Somebody tried to frame him with a
fake And somehow it all became real
Why Ennis How could this happen

Ennis gives her a look thats on the other side of
comprehension

LISA (CONTD)
You handle the discs How dida
fake one get delivered
Enniss eyes roll back into his head

PAGE Coffee

LISA (CONTD)
You want--

PAGE
He spilled coffee everywhere
Everywhere

LISA
What coffee What are you --

But Ennis sags unconscious She shakes him hard even slaps
him but Ennis is out She lets him drop down on the sofa

From outside the house somewhere high in the clouds comes
the WHINE of a hovercraft

Lisa looks once more at Ennis then gets out of there
INT ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- NIGHT

A small dreary room invisible with insignificance Which
is just the kind of room you want if youve stolen a Precog

The female Precog lies on a cot Anderson sits on a metal
folding chair watching her

Her eyes slowly open and look at him

FEMALE
My brothers arent here

ANDERSON
You didnt even look around You
knew
FEMALE
(beat)
We can sense each other You must
save

Anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head

ANDERSON
Stop I saved You It was the best
I could do

She turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall
There is a fading pink cabbage rose She traces the outline
of it with her thin finger

She turns back to him

FEMALE
Thank you Anderson

It is deeply eerie for him chatting with a Precog
ANDERSON
What am I going to do with you

Her eyes grow very serious

FEMALE
Name me Anderson

ANDERSON
What
FEMALE
Give me a name Ive never had one

Anderson rises moves around the small room He is shamed
embarrassed

ANDERSON
Listen

She turns to the wall

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Listen to me

(beat)
Listen to me Rose

It is heartrendingly touching the smile she gives him when
she faces him again

FEMALE
Rose

ANDERSON
Rose They shifted your precognition
so you would locate me

ROSE
(beat)
Yes And it hurt us physically
Did you know that The helmets the
controls It hurts

ANDERSON
(guiltily)
I didnt know

For a long moment he cant say anything But there are things
he needs to understand

ANDERSON (CONTD)
When they shifted you to find me
you didnt reveal everything That
I was going to break into Precrime

ROSE
We saw our chance You would need
to shut us down you would have to
come We wanted you to come

ANDERSON

You used me -- to save you
ROSE

I have been used all my life

Anderson
Anderson cant meet her eyes

ROSE (CONTD)
No one cared that we were human
From a human mother Taken at birth
Hooked to machines
(beat)
We have been alive Anderson
Enslaved for the greater good

Her words are unbearable for both of them She traces the
outline of the wallpaper rose again

ROSE (CONTD)
But now I have a name And I know
the man who has named - me will not
allow me to be enslaved again

Anderson looks at her then goes to the window carefully
watches the street below

ANDERSON
Rose Whats going to happen to us
Can you see that

ROSE
Im weak And away from my brothers
I see glimpses and hints of things
nearby But its all scattered
(beat)
Im tired of the future Anderson

She lies on the bed watching as Anderson comes back to her
He sits carefully on the side of her bed

Then be reaches out and gently touches her cheek
ANDERSON
You didnt know I was going to do
that did you

She is almost too overwhelmed to speak

ROSE
No Oh Anderson It was lovely

And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed
INT ENNIS PAGES HOUSE DAWN

If he were not already dead it wouldve killed Ennis Page
to see the state of his living room Precrime officers
everywhere Blood on the rug A gun beside the sofa

Witwer stands in the corner of the room witching the Coroner
crab walk Pages body It WHIRS and CLICKS as it probes and
takes samples from various sites

The holographic doctor waits patiently as the Coroner crab
makes its determinations

Lieutenant Glaser talks quietly to Witwer

LIEUTENANT GLASER
Who else could itve been

The crab probes the ragged hole in Pages head

LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONTD)
He grabbed a Precog so he could commit
an undetected murder

WITWER
(beat)
Page worshipped the system He fell
apart Shot himself

The Lieutenant rolls his eyes

LIEUTENANT GLASER
Anderson

Witwer doesnt say anything He just stares at the body The
crab finishes The holographic doctor unfolds his arms and
turns his head to Witwer He is only a computer interface
but even so it seems as if there is surprise in his
digitalized voice

HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR
Director Witwer This event is a
positive homicide

(MORE)
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR (CONTD)

(beat)
A mortal wound was generated by a
-38 calibre bullet delivered to the
left occipital portion of the anterior
skull on June 16th 2040 at 124
am Eastern Standard Time A Phase
Two Investigation is in order

No one says anything as the holographic doctor dematerializes
and the Coroner crab walks across the floor and puts itself
back in its box

At last someone moves It is Witwer He lifts his arm
pulls back his shirtsleeve and stares long and hard at his
watch

INT WITWERS OFFICE -- DAY LATER

Lisa sits biting her lip as Witwer watches two monitors play
the two versions of Andersons murder of Witwer Lisa points

LISA
There

She reaches down and freezes on a close-up of Anderson on
the two monitors

CLOSE ON - THE MONITORS

On the left monitor Anderson has blue eyes on the right he
has brown

LISA
The one on the left the first disc
-its a fake He doesnt have blue
eyes anymore

Witwer stares for a long time

WITWER
A fake

(BEAT)
But the Precogs predict the infallible
truth They dont emit fake discs

And now Lisa smiles She has set her lawyerly mind to the
solution It is her moment
LISA

Exactly You cant tamper with the
Precogs induce them to make fakes
(MORE)

LISA (CONTD)
(beat)
But that doesnt mean someone couldnt
have made a fake disc on their own
and inserted it into the delivery
system

The simplicity of it is inconceivable Witwer speaks
carefully trying to process it

WITWER
Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake
disc in with that days real ones

LISA
(excited)
Were all programmed to believe
anything we see on a Precog disc
The system has never been wrong

Witwer stares at the proof before him -- the different
colored eyes of Anderson He ejects both discs and holds
them in his hands

LISA (CONTD)
You have to call off the hunt He
was set up

Witwer looks at the two discs he is holding

WITWER
(long beat)
Its gone too far Lisa She shakes
her head shocked at his response

LISA
He was set up You both were If
Paul kills you youre both out of
the picture

WITWER
Who wants us out Of what picture

LISA
Jesus Ed Stop this thing And
then we can investigate Witwers
mouth opens and closes He tries
again

WITWER
Ennis Page was murdered last night

The blood drains from Lisas face

WITWER (CONTD)
Everything points to Paul

LISA
Hes not a murderer

WITWER
I think he is A murderer anda
future murderer
(beat)
Lisa What does it matter that the
first disc is a fake if the second

ones real

Witwers hands close tight on the discs Lisa stands there
motionless Then she turns and leaves his office abruptly
He watches her go

INT ROOM - THE SPRAWL -- DAY

Rose sits in a chair near the window She is chewing lightly
on a cracker Her face shows wonder -- at the crackers
texture and taste She holds it up and admires its shape

Andersons mood is less wondrous

ANDERSON
Rose Listen to me Im going to
leave you here I have to keep
moving

ROSES SMILE ABRUPTLY VANISHES

ROSE
No You must save my brothers

ANDERSON
Its impossible Theres no time
Ive done what I can do

Rose waits for him to finish She looks out the window at
the street scene

ROSE
Come here Anderson
He does reluctantly

ROSE (CONTD)
Do you see that boy in the blue hat
walking with his mother
(beat)
In sixty seconds he will walk beneath
those workers installing a window on
the tenth floor of that building

ANDERSONS POV - THE BOY AND THE WORKERS

Two men struggle to lift a large window in place Way below
the little boy in the blue hat walks on along the sidewalk
holding his mothers hand

ROSE (CONTD)
Theyll drop the window killing
him It is impossible to save him

Anderson turns to her shocked And then he runs for the door
hurls it open and disappears down the hall

Rose listens to his FOOTSTEPS crashing down the stairs
EXT THE STREET

Even as Anderson rushes out of the boarding house the WORKERS
have lost their grip on the window

The little BOY in the blue hat and his MOTHER walk unwittingly
toward disaster They do not appear to hear the MENS cries

The WINDOW falls end over end above the boys head The
sunlight sparks off of the glass so that from a distance it
looks like a star falling from the sky

A WOMAN across the street sees what is happening and cries
out

But what Anderson does is run He runs faster and harder
than humanly possible He does not care if he is recognized
or hit by a passing taxi He is going to get to that boy
He has to get to that boy

ANDERSON rams the BOY from behind just as the corner of the
window frame kisses the boys blue hat He knocks the boy
to safety as glass and metal SMASH into the sidewalk

The mother does not even have time to scream She is on the
ground stunned But Anderson has saved the boy
He rolls away and gets to his feet Before anyone can put
together what has happened Anderson has ducked into an alley
and is gone

INT THE ROOM - LATER

Anderson enters the room again out of breath some small
cuts on his face and hands He stands across the room staring
at Rose

Rose considers him When she speaks her voice is near and
distant at the same time For Anderson it is as if the
words are coming from a place inside his own head

ROSE
It was impossible to save that boy
-- but you did Anderson Its in
you Its what you are

Anderson sits on the floor and leans back wearily against a
wall

ANDERSON
You knew it wasnt impossible That
Id get there

Rose reveals nothing

ROSE
You are a man who saves others
(beat)
Save my brothers

Anderson almost laughs Her persistence is unbelievable

ANDERSON
Im in a lot of trouble right now

ROSE
My brothers are in more trouble
Theyve moved them to an awful
place

ANDERSON

Rose Ed Witwer -hes in the most
trouble of all Who saves him

Rose suddenly grimaces in pain and grips the side of her
head She curls into a fetal position

Anderson goes to her touches her thin shoulder Her eyes
Witwer

roll into the back of her head

Whose pain is she feeling Her own Someone elses
Anderson doesnt want to think about it

INT PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB -CHEVY CHASE MD -- NIGHT

Because Anderson has destroyed the Precog Chamber the two
Precog brothers have been brought here

The room is makeshift uncomfortable a place for
experiments The brothers are strapped into chairs They
are helmeted

But unlike before large bore needles have been placed in
their jugular veins Connected to the needles are long twists
of IV tubing There are several IVs running at high drip
rates

Witwer has his back to all this He stands with Dr Resfield
watching a technician working the keyboard on a huge
mainframe

Dr Resfield a man not given to squeamishness looks back at
the Precogs uneasy

DR RESFIELD
Were not really set up for this
type of
He stops talking when he looks into Witwers hollow eyes
is somewhere beyond the influence and reach of words

INT BOARDING HOUSE ROOM -- MORNING

Anderson tries to get Rose to drink some water Her skin is
translucent unhealthy glistening with sweat

ANDERSON
Rose Try to drink

She pushes the cup away She closes her eyes as if even
the dim light of the room causes her pain

ROSE
Your wife We have to get her here
Anderson

She opens her eyes Anderson doesnt like the feel of this

ANDERSON
Why

ROSE
I dont know

ANDERSON
What are you seeing

ROSE
Glimpses Anderson Please We
have to get her here

ANDERSON
Youre scaring me Rose

She covers his mouth with her hand

ROSE
Stop talking It uses me up

For a long time Rose says nothing Her gaze is locked onto
a distance beyond the room At last she speaks

ROSE (CONTD)
In three minutes your wife will take
a walk

DISSOLVE TO
INT JUDICIAL CENTER - ALEXANDRIA -- LATER

Lisa sits in her office But she cant stand it the sitting
and waiting She has to move

She gets up and hurriedly leaves her office
INT JUDICIAL CENTER -- MOMENTS LATER

Witwer walks past Lisas SECRETARY toward the open door of
Lisas office

SECRETARY
Sir Im sorry she stepped out for
a few minutes
(beat)
Sir

Witwer stares into the empty office There is a clock on
Lisas desk His eyes fix on it

EXT JUDICIAL CENTER ALEXANDRIA
Lisa moves quickly down the steps of the white marble
building She takes a deep breath then heads down Jefferson
Boulevard toward the city

A sleek black TRANSPORT with two Precrime officers in it
follows her from a discreet distance

In the sky above the ubiquitous Precrime hovercraft
INT CITY STREET ALEXANDRIA

Lisa walks down the street She hugs herself barely aware
of her surroundings She passes by stores restaurants
payphones video kiosks oblivious People push past
her

On a street corner as she waits at a red light the payphone
beside her begins to RING If she hears it she gives no
indication A KID reaches for it listens hangs up

She walks on Stores Restaurants An art gallery As
she comes abreast of another PAYPHONE it suddenly starts to
ring This time Lisa glances at it But again walks on

The TRANSPORT weaves through traffic nearby She walks past
the KL Lawrence Graphics Museum And another restaurant
And a PAYPHONE And this time finally when it too RINGS
she turns and looks hard at it

A man begins to walk over to it Lisa almost knocks him out
of the way to get to it She grabs at the receiver

LISA
Hello Hello

ANDERSONS VOICE
I need you

Lisas forehead sags against the side of the payphone She
basks in the sound of him

ANDERSONS VOICE (CONTD)
Its 103 Set your watch exactly

Lisa pushes the buttons on her digital watch as she listens
LISA Okay

ANDERSONS VOICE (CONTD)
This is what you have to do

We now hear ANDERSON continue in VOICE OVER as we follow
Lisa through a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
EXT THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM
Lisa walks up the steps of the museum

ANDERSON (VO)
At 107 hang up the phone and enter
the Lawrence Museum

INT GRAPHICS GALLERY

Lisa walks quickly through a display of 19th century magazine
advertising

INT GRAPHICS GALLERY

The two Precrime officers walk into a room filled with Chinese
graphics

ANDERSON (VO)
At 113 the two Precrime officers
following you take a wrong turn into
a different room losing sight of
you for ten seconds

The officers start toward the entrance way to another room
then hesitate uncertainly and go for another entrance way

EXT THE LAWRENCE MUSEUM
Lisa hurries down the steps
INT A SUBWAY STATION
Lisa boards the A MagLev train
ANDERSON (VO)
An undercover transport officer will
have received emergency orders to
follow you
(MORE)

Hes wearing a red tie He has short
blond hair

INT THE SUBWAY CAR

The blond transport officer with the red tie sits at the far
end of Lisas car watching her

At the next stop Lisa gets off He follows not too far
behind
INT SUBWAY STATION

Lisa starts up the stairs She looks at her watch then
makes herself pause a few moments to keep within Andersons
time frame She starts up again

ANDERSON (VO)
As you come around the bend cry out
and turn around and slap the
officer

Lisa does this and the officer reels back surprised At the
same moment two big men rushing to catch a subway come into
view and see this happening Lisa starts to run When the
undercover officer tries to stop her the two men grab the
officer and they get into a fight

Lisa escapes
INT A TAXI - THE SPRAWL

Lisa looks at her watch then taps the window for the driver
to stop She gets out

ANDERSON (VO)

Stay on Ninth street Underneath
Ninth street is the main power feed
for The Sprawl Itll mess up the
navigational beacon on the hovercraft
(beat)

Keep switching taxis But stay on
Ninth

She hails another taxi She holds her hand over the
IdentiScan before it can read her The taxi driver looks at
her sees her smile sees the prepaid cash card she holds
out to him

LISA
Two hundred dollars if you dont
scan me
Its The Sprawl -- stranger things have happened He grabs
the card and jerks his head for her to get in They take

off

EXT NINTH STREET LATER

Lisa gets out of the taxi and looks briefly into the sky
It is dense with holographic billboards skim-jets
dirigibles Somewhere in all that is a Precrime hovercraft
And the neighborhood around her is definitely downscale

ANDERSON (VO)
The hovercraft will try to drop
altitude but the air traffic will
slow it down
(beat)
Precrime loses you Youll have to
walk two miles Dont get scanned

EXT THE SPRAWL

Lisa walks hurriedly down a side street She stands out in
her white dress -- a spot of vulnerable color in world of
black

Too vulnerable to pass up A MAN in a gray overcoat slides
out from between two buildings in front of her He is not
coy about his intent He comes straight at her all business

Lisa freezes in place She looks at her watch The man
grabs her by the shoulder When she starts to scream he
claps his hand over her mouth hard

MAN
You bite me bitch Ill pull your
teeth out

Her eyes look around frantically He starts to drag her
backwards into the dark

ANDERSON leaps into view and slams the mans head into a
light post It takes a lot of slamming before lie loosens
his grip on Lisa His legs at last collapse under him

Anderson scoops Lisa off the ground She hugs him hard

Then pulls back from him She gives him a look

LISA
Cut it a little close there
honeybunch

ANDERSON

Rose got the street wrong Shes
getting weak

LISA
INT THE BOARDING HOUSE -- LATER

Rose sits up in bed silently watching Lisa and Anderson

together

Lisa needs to touch him She keeps a hand on his arm brushes
back a loose look of his hair Rose is mesmerized by her
actions She drinks in everything every bit of life

Anderson and Lisa are deep in conversation

They speak to

each other as if Rose were hardly present in the room

Anderson is trying to process everything Lisa has told him

ANDERSON
Two discs One fake One real

LISA

I dont think there were supposed to

be two Whoever planned it wasnt

counting on two

They are silent for a long time Rose watches them work it

through

ANDERSON
An infallible system Every disc
ever generated has been true

LISA

Somebody wants you out of the way --

so they make a fake disc Who ever

doubts the discs

ANDERSON

I never doubted it I saw it And

believed it absolutely I was

certain I was going to murder Witwer

Anderson is shaking Lisa wraps her arms around him His

voice is a stunned whisper

ANDERSON (CONTD)

I saw the fake and believed so much
in the system that I saw myself as

a murderer

(beats)
And the Precogs picked up those
thoughts

LISA

And generated the second disc The

real one

ANDERSON
A self-fulfilling prophesy I

believed it was true And that made

Anderson and Lisa turn and look at Rose She lies curled on
the bed her face to the wall

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Rose If all this is based on a lie
-the fake disc -- then do I really
kill Witwer

ROSE
(beat)

We see what we see Im sorry
Anderson Its been predicted
Such a small voice delivering a message of such finality

INT WITWERS OFFICE -- MIDNIGHT

Lieutenant Glaser tries to get through to Witwer Witwers
back is turned to him

LIEUTENANT GLASER
We cant take chances sir

Witwer doesnt move or answer

LIEUTENANT GLASER (CONTD)
It happens in less than three hours

(beat)
We put you in a hovercraft and keep
you airborne -- until after the event

WITWER
The event

Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably

LIEUTENANT GLASER
Ive been ordered to get you onto
the craft By force if necessary

WITWER
The event is inevitable Lieutenant

Witwer doesnt turn around

WITWER (CONTD)
The Precogs are never wrong The
event will take place Ima
believer Arent you
LIEUTENANT GLASER
I dont leave this room without you
sir The Security Panel insists

INT THE BOARDING HOUSE SIMULTANEOUS

Anderson and Lisa keep working it peeling away the layers
Rose lies silent

ANDERSON
Nobody could slip a fake disc past
Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head

LISA
He was the weak link in the perfect
system

ANDERSON

Obsessive compulsive niners cant
allow changes in the routine

LISA

Something threw him off

(beat)
He tried to tell me It didnt make
any sense Something about spilled
coffee

(beat)
Someone was in his office with him
And coffee spilled

We stay CLOSE ON Anderson and Lisa as Roses voice cuts in

ROSE (VO)
We were always treated as if we
werent alive As if we werent
there

The camera pulls back and they are watching her as she
continues to speak

ROSE (CONTD)
Even now You forget that Im here
You talk between yourselves And
when you need me to see into the
future then you turn to me

ANDERSON
Rose What is it
ROSE
(beat)
We werent just lost in the future
We were in the Chamber too Our
eyes were open In the present

And then Anderson gets it He kneels beside her bed
ANDERSON

Your eyes were open What did you
see Rose

ROSE
Who would I have told Who ever
talked to us Who cared that we
could talk

ANDERSON
Rose Who spilled the coffee
Straight ahead

Rose stares stright ahead

MEMORY HIT

Rose sits in her chair in the Precog Chamber Her brothers
sit in their usual places on either side of her The
technicians tend to them

Roses eyes are open She sees everything in the room The
technicians the machines and across the room a large
window where she can see Ennis Page working the mainframe
computer

Rose watches through the window

As the computer emits discs Page gathers them

ROSE (VO)
Ed Witwer entered Pages office

Witwer carries a mug of coffee
Ennis Page goes red in the face stares at the coffee Speaks
to Witwer angrily pointing to the coffee We cant hear
the words
ROSE (V0O) (CONTD)
Page was so upset at the sight of
the coffee

Witwer goes to put the coffee down on a small table It
tips and spills

Page looks like his head will explode He pulls a neatly
folded white handkerchief out of his back pocket and drops
to his hands and knees and begins to obsessively blot at the
coffee stain on his spotless rug

ROSE (VO) (CONTD)
Ed Witwer took a disc from his pocket
reached over Page and put it in one
of the open cases

Witwer closes the case He looks through the window into
the Precog Chamber but the only one watching him is Rose --
and what does she matter

Page rises angrily from cleaning the rug Witwer shrugs in
apology and leaves the room Page stares after him

BACK TO SCENE
Rose is weeping She looks at Anderson and Lisa

ROSE (CONTD)
I didnt understand what Id seen
And I had no one to tell

Lisa puts her arms around Rose Anderson tries to comprehend
what he has heard

ANDERSON
Ed

Lisa turns and speaks softly to her husband

LISA
The perfect system -brought down by
a cup of coffee My god

ANDERSON
(long beat)
He set into motion his own death
He didnt know it would go this far
(to Rose)
What makes me leave this room If I
stay here I wont kill him Right

But Rose and her brothers have already answered that question
for him

CUT TO
INT WITWERS OFFICE

Lieutenant Glaser looks at his watch Witwer is still in
his chair turned away from him

WITWER
You see if you think you can put me
on a hovercraft and save me then
you dont believe in the infallibility
of the Precog system

Lieutenant Glaser has his orders He begins to approach

And as he does Witwer swivels his chair around and lifts
the weapon he has been holding and silently shoots Lieutenant
Glaser in the forehead

WITWER (CONTD)
And what I do not want around me
are nonbelievers

Witwer steps over the body as if it doesnt exist and walks
out of the office locking the door behind him

EXT THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB - CHEVY CHASE MD -- LATER

Witwer gets out his car and looks at the two story concrete
building that houses the lab The lights are out in all the
windows except the back section of the second floor There
the lights burn brightly

Witwer sees Precrime officers posted at intervals around it
He smiles as if he knows something they dont He looks at
his watch It is a cool night but his face is slick with

sweat

He walks to the entrance of the building An OFFICER 1s
startled to see him

WITWER
Things quiet

OFFICER
Sir Should you be here

WITWER
Theres been a development A bodys
been found in the Sprawl

OFFICER
Andersons
WITWER
Theyre checking it out I need to
see what the Precogs have seen

Witwer is IdentiScanned The door opens and he goes in
INT THE LAB

Dr Resfield looks up as Witwer strides into the lab carrying
a tv under his arm Witwer is the last person he wants to
see

WITWER
Borrowed this from the technicians’
lounge You dont think theyll
mind do you

DRRESFIELD
You shouldnt be here Director

Dr Resfields eyes cut to a large digital clock on the wall
the red numbers ticking off time in seconds

Witwer looks for a plug finds one Plugs in the tv

WITWER
No no This is exactly where I
should be
DR RESFIELD
Youre under a lot of strain
Director
Witwer finds what hes looking for -- the continuous loop of
his murder by Anderson Call Now Call Now
WITWER
And tvs so good for that -- soothes
the mind

Witwer turns his sweaty face to Resfield and gives him a
bright smile The scientist looks like he wants to run out
of the room

Witwer takes him by the elbow and guides him toward the
Precogs Two technicians hover over the Precogs adjusting
IVs and turning dials on the Precogss organic helmets

The Precogs wince and shiver with each turn of the dial
But they are no longer violently seizing -- they are too
weak for that
WITWER (CONTD)
Bring me up to speed Doc

DR RESFIELD
Were getting nothing from them

WITWER
And thats because

Witwer still grips him by the elbow

DR RESFIELD
I dont know

WITWER
Do you think they know where Anderson
is

DR RESFIELD
Its impossible to tell

(beat)
Weve done everything Maybe even
too much

WITWER STARES AT THE PRECOGS

WITWER
They know how to find Anderson for
me

(MORE)

WITWER (CONTD)
(beat)
Theyre the perfect machine Doctor
You just have to know which button
to push

INT BOARDING HOUSE - THE SPRAWL

Rose looks like shes on fire Anderson wets another towel
wrings it over the sink Lisa takes it and wipes down Roses
face and arms

Roses lips are moving soundlessly Her eyes are shut tight
She begins to writhe in bed

ANDERSON
Jesus Christ

LISA
Come on Rose
ANDERSON LOOKS AT HIS WATCH

ANDERSON
One hour We hold it together for
an hour Witwer lives -- and Im not
a murderer

LISA

She wont last an hour

It suddenly looks much worse than that Roses body contorts
horribly and she arches up off the bed Lisa cant control
her

Anderson reaches for her wraps her in his arms trying to
hold and comfort her

ANDERSON
Rose

She begins to wail as she thrashes in his arms

ROSE
Hes killed him Anderson

Rose stiffens into a seizure posture then her body goes
slack Anderson eases her back on the bed He stares at
her stricken

Her voice barely leaves her now

ROSE (CONTD)
You didnt save my brother

Anderson reels at her words

ANDERSON
Did he kill both of them Rose
Rose

Rose manages to speak one last time Her whispered words
damn him

ROSE
Does it matter Anderson

Anderson rises Looks down at Rose
It matters He starts to move quickly

Lisa takes hold of his arm
LISA
If you leave this room

Anderson kisses her

ANDERSON
Then Im a cop just trying to do
hisjob

He reaches for his duffel bag

When the door closes behind him Rose turns her head slightly
and looks And then her eyes drift closed as she goes to a
place deep within her own mind

EXT A STREET - THE SPRAWL - MOMENTS LATER

He passes by several cars on the street But theyre all
auto-drive they wont do him any good

So he smashes a store window within forty-five seconds a
city police transport zooms up lights flashing Two city
officers leap out of the transport They approach the
smashed-in store window weapons drawn Which is a mistake
Anderson rises into view behind them and sonically blasts a
small crater in the sidewalk they are standing on

As they trip and fall he is already spraying them down with
BindFoam

Their second mistake is they left the engine running to power
the bank of Nits -Tracker lights on the cars hood and roof
Anderson screeches off through the choking predawn streets

of The Sprawl a beacon of light in the darkness

INT THE LAB

The DIGITAL CLOCK races through time Witwer reaches his
hand up and touches the vanishing numbers

The camera pulls back and we see Dr Resfield and the two
technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner

And when we see the lab in its entirety there sprawled on
the floor in front of his chair is one of the Precog brothers
A small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of
his skull

The other Precog sits very still in his chair He is still
connected to everything -- his helmet is in place the TVs
drip into him His eyes are open and when Witwer moves
the Precogs eyes follow him
Witwer can feel them on him He turns around

WITWER
Is he coming No Yes Maybe
(beat)
I think yes

The Precog looks at him

WITWER (CONTD)
And you think yes

Witwer points to the tv screen running Andersons murder of
Witwer Witwer smiles triumphantly

WITWER (CONTD)
Infallibly immutably yes

The Precog looks at him Witwers smile vanishes and
suddenly strides across the room and claps his hand over
the Precogs eyes Then he turns and stares again at the
clock

EXT THE PRECOG ENGINEERING LAB

Three officers stand thirty feet apart in front of the
building facing outward toward the parking lot weapons
cradled in their arms

Behind them is a line of yew bushes AS we watch the officer
on the left is yanked off his feet backward into the bushes
Several moments pass and the same thing happens to the
officer on the right

The officer guarding the front entrance casually looks right
Then he looks hard He grips his weapon tight and swings
left No one there either

ANDERSON drops him hard from behind The officer crumples
onto the cement

But Andersons not done with him Anderson lifts him up
struggles to drag him forward toward the entrance

Anderson holds him upright in place The mans head lolls
backward Which is Perfect for what Anderson needs to do
Anderson reaches his fingers towards the mans closed eyes
He pulls up on the eyelids

An IdentiScan over the entrance clicks on and reads the mans
eyes Access granted the doors HISS open Anderson enters
the building dragging the officer with him
INT THE LAB

Anderson enters the lab The very building sickens him
What he sees sickens him even more

The remaining Precog sits strapped into his chair Witwer
sits beside him in the other Precog chair the dead brother
at his feet Witwer wears the dead Precogs helmet His
hand is in his lap holding a gun

He grins when Anderson appears He takes off the helmet
drops it on the floor

WITWER
I figured since I can see the future
too maybe I could get a little disc
action going
(beat)
Just kidding

Anderson stares at his old partner Then he looks up at the
digital clock Five-seventeen AM Witwer looks too then
turns back to Anderson

WITWER (CONTD)
You find you been doing that a lot
this week Looking at clocks
(beat)
Three minutes to go

Anderson turns to the tv

ANDERSON
Theres never anything good on you
know
Now Witwer smiles
WITWER

There Thats the old Paul

ANDERSON
Youre not the old Ed Youve lost
it

Witwer rises from the chair the gun in his hand

WITWER
You lost it You went weak in the
knees partner

ANDERSON
Im not your partner

Witwer looks at him sadly

WITWER
The air went out of you when Frank
DIgnazio killed himself

ANDERSON
He was guilty I accepted that

WITWER
No you didnt The doubts were
creeping in on you The lab trying
to engineer more Precogs Malcolm
pressuring you to expand

Witwer reaches out and gently touches the remaining Precog
brothers cheek

WITWER (CONTD)
Belief is the basis of the system
It was your job to be the ultimate
believer

Witwer is breathing hard He lifts a hand and wipes the
sweat from his face

WITWER (CONTD)
And when Frank died you faltered
Im a cop I see into the hearts of
men
(beat)
And the thing about you is you
wouldnt have just walked away

ANDERSON
Never been my style

Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile

WITWER

Precrime needs to grow You would
have stood in its way The Security
Panel wouldnt have understood that
What youre capable of What a
bulldog you are

(beat)
Look what youve been doing to us
all week Amazing Youre the best

ANDERSON
So you took matters into your own hands
WITWER
I understood the threat I understood
YOU

Anderson looks at the dead Precog

ANDERSON
You killed a Precog You ended the
system you wanted to protect

WITWER
Wrong This lab will make more
Believe it Paul

They look at the CLOCK Five-nineteen

ANDERSON
Knowing the exact moment of your
death -its made you crazy Ed

Witwer looks at the tv The TV REALITY is almost in synch
with what is happening in the room

Witwer lifts his gun -- and then realizes something is
terribly wrong

Anderson is standing there before him just as he is on the
disc -- except there is a major difference

WITWER
You sonofabitch

Anderson lifts up both hands

WITWER (CONTD)
You didnt bring your gun

ANDERSON
Thats right No gun

WITWER
You see Thats exactly what Im
talking about You dont Believe

Anderson just looks at Witwer raging at him

WITWER (CONTD)
The system is infallible

ANDERSON Doesnt Seem to be Witwer reaches behind him and
pulls a second gun from out of his belt
WITWER (CONTD)
I guess thats why Ive always carried
two

He tosses the gun to Anderson It clatters at Andersons
feet

ANDERSON
You cant have it both ways You
dont want to die Thats why you
lured me here -- to kill me first
(MORE)

ANDERSON (CONTD)
(beat)
But it you dont diet the system is
flawed and you couldnt live with
that

Witwer SHOOTS him once in the right thigh Anderson cries
out falls to the concrete floor

WITWER
Pick it up

Anderson speaks through his teeth ANDERSON It doesnt happen
Witwer looks frantically at the tv at the clock

He reaches over and opens the dripmeter on a piggy back IV
feeding into the Precogs main line A thick yellow fluid

begins to flow toward the Precogs jugular vein

WITWER (CONTD)
Youre killing him partner

And what choice finally does Anderson have He reaches
for the gun

ANDERSON
Lets not do this Ed Witwer trains
his gun on Anderson Anderson trains
his gun on Witwer

ANDERSON (CONTD)
Oh Ed

Witwer lowers his gun And stands there between Anderson
and the doomed Precog

The yellow liquid has almost reached the Precogs jugular
Anderson shoots Witwer once in the heart Witwer is thrown
back across the room against a wall beneath the clock

Anderson drags himself to the Precog and rips the yellow IV
out of the main line The yellow drips onto the floor
mingling with Witwers red

Anderson crawls to his friend and cradles him Witwer
whispers something and Anderson leans close to hear him

WITWER
Now do you believe

Anderson pulls away from Witwer and lets him take his last
breaths alone

DISSOLVE TO

DARKNESS

And then slowly emerging from the mists of darkness a pale
beautifully proportioned FACE

It is Roses face The camera pulls back and we see that
she is lying on a grassy hillside Her brother is lying
beside her

They are looking up at the night sky at a sky filled with
stars

Rose stares up into the sky and speaks in a soft voice to
her brother

ROSE
James Can you guess what Im
thinking
JAMES
(beat)
NO

James smiles And then after a long moment so does Rose

THE END
