Still out in the garden somewhere
EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

Tall dark buildings -- no power Some ON FIRE CRUMBLING
PEOPLE scatter in panic DEBRIS spins up in a HOWLING WIND
BODIES lie in the wet gutter lined with winter slush

A Man stands eyes searching the chaos -- he is sharp and
soulful but anxious He looks up -- swirling celestial
lights FLICKER behind the low clouds This is ION WE TRACK around as he turns -- A WOMAN is standing next to
him also gazing around in awe We do not see her face Ion
stares at her strangely her hair whipping in the wind

Suddenly Ion notices a MAN -- AZRAYL -- only a shadowed
silhouette in the gloomy street He raises a GUN at them

Ion’s eyes fill with ABSOLUTE FEAR as he glances at the Woman
next to him Ion raises his hand like a feeble shieldBLAM

SMASH CUT TO

EXT FOREST WORLD - NIGHT

Ion hits the floor PUNCHED in the face Here his hair is
LONG AND BRAIDED -- subtle tattoos cover his bare arms and
torso tiny dots form lines of GEOMETRIC PATTERNS that SPIRAL
over his skin

He blinks from his vision -- but there’s NO TIME something
is wrong Ion gets up as we see AZRAYL together with other
MEN robed in black Azrayl is pulling away a STRUGGLING WOMAN
who SCREAMS She is timelessly beautiful dark hair ALICE

All around them is a lush peaceful wood Redwoods tower in
the moonlight above boulders pine needles and abundant LIFE

Ion frantically PUSHES past the men -- but it’s too late
Azrayl coldly shoves her down andSPEARS HER in the chest

ION
NO

Azrayl doesn’t try to stop him merely steps aside as Ion
drops next to her distraught taking her in his arms Her
deep eyes look at him not afraid anymore She smiles

ALICE
Find me Find me again

And she dies In silent tears Ion closes his eyes

MATCH CUT TO
INT TEMPLE - DAY

Eyes snap open They scan around taking in the room as if
for the first time Ion seems the same age but now his hair
is LONG AND FILTHY with a YEARS-OLD BEARD He sits on a DUSTY
STONE FLOOR in a SIMPLE TEMPLE thin shafts of sunlight
breaching the dark small birds FLUTTER in the rafters

OTHER MONKS of all ages meditate or quietly shuffle past

Ion’s gaze lands on a nearby candle He stares long and
deeply at its dancing flame and HE SMILES But after a
moment something across the hall breaks his attention

The ABBOT enters with a man in a suit -- some kind of
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL Ion watches through his dirty hair

ABBOT
(accented English)
--he is here longer than any of
us Longer than anyone remembers
Always here always now But there
is a great toll

The Official looks at the Abbot a flicker of concern

GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
A toll

ABBOT
(whisper )
He has seen too much Attacks his
memoryit is difficult to hold on
to his truth History haunts him
like nightmares returning

He points towards Ion seated against the wall The Official
walks forward to Ion and stops reverent before him

GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL
We’vebeen looking for you for a
long time It is finished built
You could help us now

Ion slowly stands up - he has an intense gaze and presence
like a man who has stoically endured unimaginable hardship

A little nervous the Official pulls a SMALL LEATHER PENDANT
on a string from his pocket and hands it to Ion
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL (CONTD)
It was all in there as you said We
followed it exactly And I also
have this

He reaches in his pocket again and gives Ion a PHOTOGRAPH
It is of a woman -- Alice Hard to tell it’s a night scene
she stands half-turned in shadow her eyes gleaming smiling

It hits Ion hard Sadness and a deep longing in his eyes

GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL (CONTD)
Ion It doesn’t have to be you We
could send someone else

Ion stares at the photo for another moment then he looks up

ION
No I must go

CUT TO BLACK

GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL (V0)
Thank you Were lucky to have you

ION (V0)
No I am what I am

TITLE EMERGES OVER BLACK ION

EXT SPACE - BLACK

SILENCE A LONELY SHIP melts between stars catching a sun’s
light Spherical sections connect like a model atom -- it
seems fragile more a satellite than a shuttle

ION (V0)

(to a character in scene)
I‘1l tell you though I feel that
Ive told this story countless
times You think I’m different from
you because I tell you what I see
because I walk on Earths you cannot
imagine But you will too one day

INT ION’S SPACESHIP CONTINUOUS
Ion is asleep on a bed the PHOTO beside him He’s clean-

shaven his hair cropped short Stars shine behind and all
around him -- as if his bed is floating through space
But a DIALOGUE BOX appears among the stars It is actually
a ROUND ROOM whose walls mimic the exact view outside

The box reads Earth located Calibrating orbital
trajectorydone Observation systemonline Time to
orbit A piechart timer appears slowly COUNTING DOWN

ION (V0) (CONTD)
We don’t grow old on my Earth
parallel to this You know that I
dont know why it is your bodies
decay but it’s all that I know
that I am alive Cut me and I bleed
-- we are the same You just
haven’t woken up it’s a sickness
of ideology You all wait faithful
that it and everything will be
granted in your future after life
But the future is an illusion
unattainable Immortality is Now

EXT SOLAR SYSTEM SAME TIME

The Ship is a TINY SPECK in front of JUPITER -- stunning

INT ION’S SPACESHIP - LATER

Ion slowly wakes up in the bed He turns over and sees the
dialogue box and the timerit’s ALMOST COMPLETE

Ion LEAPS OUT OF BED agitated and rushes forwards as A DOOR
OPENS in the wall He doubles back grabs the PHOTO from the
bed and stuffs it in his pocket as HE SPRINTS OUT

INT CONTROL CENTER ION’S SPACESHIP - MOMENTS LATER

Ion FURIOUSLY RIPS WIRES out from under a clean console --
there are no buttons anywhere as if EVERYTHING IS AUTOMATED

He YANKS live-wires and dangerously touches them together --
SPARKS FLY and the power SURGES

A screen changes Orbit trajectoryFAILED CRASH EXPECTED
Next is a high-tech 6” square glass-cased box -- call it THE
SIGNAL Ion KICKS it free from the console -- tiny white
chipsets and glass canisters SMASH across the floor

Alarm lights FLASH Ion looks up at another screen anxiously
It reads Signal initiationFAILED He nods satisfied
EXT SPACE - SAME TIME

The Ship glides towards our vast BLUE EARTH -- ripples as it
enters the OUTER-ATMOSPHERE beginning to HEAT UP

ION (VO) (CONTD)
But all of you are afraid to accept
it Youre afraid of everything Of
each other of yourselves of not
having enough or not being good
enough All of it comes down to a
fear of death Which is futile

INT ION’S SPACESHIP - MOMENTS LATER

Ion climbs inside a clear PROTECTIVE POD slightly larger
than a coffin He straps in and it closes over him

A GEL-LIQUID immediately starts SPURTING into the pod
filling it -- Ion stares at the photo in his shaking hand
EXT EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE CONTINUOUS -

The Ship PLUMMETS FAST -- whole sections break off engulfed
in FRICTION FLAMESthe Ship is DISINTEGRATING on entry
INT IONS SPACESHIP - CONTINUOUS

Protective liquid rises above his head filling the pod EYES
WIDEN in fear as he BREATHES IN THE LIQUID into his lungs

But he can breathe THIS -- slowly he calms takes a last
glance at the photo in his hand Then he CLOSES HIS EYES

ION (VO) (CONT’D)
I am sent to lead them here But I
sabotaged their plan They cannot
know They must not find me here

EXT EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE - DAY

WE FREE-FALL with the LAST INTACT PART of the Ship -- the
ground getting LARGER -- flames BLOW OUT DROPPING FAST and --

BAM The Ship SLAMS into a desert landscape -- SPLINTERING
and CRUMBLING as it CRUNCHES in a sickening impact

TITLE Roswell New Mexico July 8 1947

INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - MODERN DAY

Ion’s eyes open as if from only a blink He’s in the drivers
seat of a parked SUV Shaved face cropped hair But there
are cuts on his face and a red gash across his shirt He
looks down -- in his hand he holds THE PHOTO

The windows are fogged up from the cold outside and sunlight
glows through them A figure approaches The passenger door
opens and AMARA MUNRO gets in carrying a plastic bag

She is dark and pretty but with a sense of deep sadness --
she too is scraped and bruised ash and dust on her clothes

Ion hides the photo in his pocket but she notices

ION
Was everything okay

She ignores him taking a sip of a soda from the bag

ION (CONT’D)
We have to be careful

AMARA
Okay

ION
They could be anywhere

AMARA
Yeah okay I got it

ION
Okay

He puts the car in gear and we notice that it’s been HOT-
WIRED Then he drives out of the gas station and gets onto a
freeway Outside looks like our modern American north-east

AMARA
How do you know where you’re going

ION
I dont know

She rolls her eyes -- of course
ION (CONTD)

--maybe I’ve been here before I
don’t remember I just know
Amara toys with a HOSPITAL BRACELET on her arm -- and we
notice an OLD DISTINCTIVE SCAR across the veins on her wrist

She takes another sip and peers sideways at him curiously

AMARA
What’s with the necklace

He instinctively touches the leather pendant hanging close to
his neck It fits in with the pattern of his subtle tattoos

ION
What’s with it

AMARA
Yea what is it Did she give it to
you the woman you’re looking for
(he’s surprised by this)
the doctor told me about it

He glances at her Amara has strangely SIMILAR FEATURES to
Alice almost as if they could have been sisters

ION
No

AMARA
Are you going to talk at all I
think I at least deserve that

ION
I’m sorry I didn’t mean for this
to happen

AMARA

Yeah well neither did I But here
we are bleeding in a car

ION
(concerned)
Are you okay

Amara turns away and stares out the window There’s snow on
the side of the freeway For A FEW MOMENTS they are SILENT

AMARA
The doctor said you’d live forever
That youve solved aging

ION
I havent solved anything

Amara looks at him studying his face Intrigued cautious
AMARA
How did they find you Tell me
Where did you come from

Ion touches the LEATHER PENDANT -- ready to talk But sad

ION
It always begins in the same way
because it has to With falling
And then I crash

INT SECRET MILITARY HOSPITAL
Gel-liquid SPLASHES down to a sterile tile floor

Ion’s protective pod is on a table cut open -- Ion lies
unconscious inside WHITE HAZARD-SUITED DOCTORS swarm around
the table One picks out the PHOTO puts it in an evidence
bag Another takes the LEATHER PENDANT from Ion’s neck

An early defibrillator they ZAP Ion -- he BURSTS AWAKE
COUGHING and SPEWING gel-liquid from his mouth Terrified he
STRUGGLES WILDLY against the alien hands around him --

But one INJECTS a SEDATIVE into him The world goes dark

EXT FOREST WORLD NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

“NATIVE ION” (braided hair handmade earthy clothes) and
ALICE are crouched in the HOLLOW OF A TREE soaking wet

PEOPLE APPROACH searching Lights appear and shine in their
faces Weapons CLINK in their hands

MAN (SUBTITLE)
(strange alien language)
Come out of there now

Ion and Alice slowly walk forward under their lights The Man
approaches and lowers his light -- it is AZRAYL He inspects
Ion’s torso looking at his tattoos Ion is terrified

AZRAYL (SUBTITLE)
How long have you been here Our
people are coming

ION (SUBTITLE)
No

AZRAYL (SUBTITLE)
I’m sorry She must pass on now
ALICE (SUBTITLE)
What Ion

Ion glances at her with terrified anxiety Azrayl suddenly
GRABS HER she STRUGGLES Ion LAUNCHES to attack but one of
the other men STRIKES HIM HARD in the face ION FALLS

INT INTERROGATION ROOM 1
Water splashes into “Present Ion’s” SWOLLEN BEATEN FACE

INTERROGATOR
Wake up Commie bastard You’re
here with us the Americans We
wanna know about this spy plane of
yours remember

Ions handcuffs CLINK behind his chair sat in the middle of
a dank dim room The INTERROGATOR stands over him with
a cigarette oozing from his lips AN OFFICER sits watching

ION
(weak)
Where is my necklace

BAM The interrogator HITS Ion blood spatters from his lips

INTERROGATOR
I ask the questions got it
(Beat)
So let’s start over Which agency
are you with what was your
mission and where did you come
from

Ion hangs his head in exhaustion

INT VARIOUS MILITARY INSTITUTIONS - MONTAGE

Ion is hooked up to lie detector machines - EEG sensors
attached and removed -- he’s blindfolded and moved to
different facilities -- the guards outside his cell grow
older with time then are replaced by younger models -- he
watches TV news showing world events -- scientists tinker
with technology from his ship -- syringes take his blood --
tests are run -- questions asked -- he’s beaten again
electrocuted

Ion is connected to lie detector machines EEG sensorsetc

THIS CYCLE REPEATS itself moving FORWARD THROUGH TIME from
1947 ONWARDS as we hear more snippets of questioning over it

ION (V0O)

The universes are infinite one for
every permutation or possibility
ever All shimmering herejust a
hairs breadth away in parallel
Earths past and future your dreams
and worlds unimaginable exist right
now if only you could see you
could reach out and touch them

(Beat jump to)

I don’t knowI can’t remember
It’s hard I can’t hold on to it
all I don’t know where I started
anymore I leave one Earth and
the ship travels between them
through something called a “Greys
Schism” or at least those are the
words that appear onscreen
Eventually we -- the ship and I --
come to another version of Earth

(Beat)

No I can’t tell you more about it
I don’t know how it works I’m just
the Scout -- I don’t build the
ship Use whatever you need from
it any of it except that That
box the signal is forbidden It’s
too dangerous Do you understand I
crashed on purpose To stop it
Leave it alone or you will die

(jump again serious)

The Signal is supposed to go on
and then they come But I didn’t
let it I don’t do that I can’t
let that happen andand so I

crashed

(anxious cover the truth)
I--I’m trying to help you See If
they come here you will die
That’s the mission my mission
They are people but they too will
never age And no one Earth can
support an ever-expanding race of
men They have to find new Earths --
other planets are too risky Earth
is our home and there are infinite
versions in parallel

INT ION’S CELL - NIGHT

An iron door SLAMS Ion is alone in a concrete room with a
bed and a toilet Tired and thin Ion sits down in the lotus
position and closes his eyes

INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - MODERN DAY
Amara listens to Ion still driving on the freeway

AMARA
They had you for over sixty years

ION
Yes I’ve endured far worse And
this got better

INT ION’S CELL - DAY 1978

Ion is meditating again But now he seems healthier better
treated His cell is full of books Writing covers the walls -
- scribblings quotes drawings - many languages some seem
alien A mixture of ART and SCIENCE

DR CHRIS RIVERS comes in -- slightly gangly smart A
military scientist He doesn’t disturb Ion who seems to be in
a trance Rivers looks around

On the wall is a quote “HISTORY IS A NIGHTMARE FROM WHICH I
AM TRYING TO AWAKE - JJ” (James Joyce) Rivers picks up a
book from a pile -- The Myth of Sisyphus by ALBERT CAMUS

ION (0S)
Hello Dr Rivers

Rivers looks up still holding the book

DR RIVERS
I didn’t want to disturb you
(Beat)
I was told you went through these
Camus books in two days That good

ION
He was a good friend of mine

DR RIVERS
(knowing like he’s had
similar talks before)
Camus
(MORE)

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
Ion I think he died like twenty
years ago probably in France You
didn’t know him

ION
(confused)
I did On another Earth after his
life here maybe He helped me

DR RIVERS
Right Well listen I’ve got
something for you today
(looks around for a seat)
And you know our offer for nicer
quarters still stands -- something
a little less prison-like

ION
What would I do with more space
Thanks but this is fine for me

Rivers pulls up a chair He carefully takes something from
his jacket and hands it to Ion -- it is the LEATHER PENDANT

DR RIVERS
They told me it’s not of much
interest to them anymore So it’s
finally yours again for good

Shocked Ion carefully pulls apart the leather knot to reveal
a DIAMOND hidden like a seed inside Rivers smiles

ION
(moved)
Thank you Chris Really

DR RIVERS
It’s not real Did you know that
(Beat)
They had it analyzed It’s nota
geological diamond -- they can tell
these things somehow It was
manufactured

Ion doesn’t say anything -- just puts the pendant around his
neck But the cryptic look on his face hints I know

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
»e-and then I also have this

Rivers hands Ion a plastic evidence bag -- THE PHOTO inside
Ion gazes at it stunned Emotion wells up gaining momentum

A strange shift in behavior SLIGHTLY MANIC even Hand
shaking a dam breaks unknown years of endurance pour out

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
Are you okay

ION
(manic anxious)

»She she’s all I have all I can
hold on to Everything else fades
away I’ve seen too much I can’t
remember it only some only her
Itll be okay it’1l all be okay
when I find her Everything will be
good then

DR RIVERS
Ion Who is she

ION (CONTD)
(still staring at photo)
--I‘m looking looking so
carefully for her here

DR RIVERS
What do you mean you’re looking
for her here On this base

ION
On this Earth
(whisper a secret)
She could be here I have to find
her again Nothing ever dies Every
possibility exists somewhere

Dr Rivers stares at Ion shocked A big revelation
DR RIVERS
Ion you’re locked down here with
us How are you looking for
someone

Ion looks up at him worried -- he didn’t mean to give this
away He’s scared but then he does trust Dr Rivers
INT UNDERGROUND LAB —- DAY 1984

Dr Rivers and a GENERAL look through a window at Ion
meditative inside a room with EEG sensors on his head
14

DR RIVERS
(re EEG readouts)
See this pattern he’s producing
really strong Theta waves You see
them in dreams ESP out-of-body
experience He’s going somewhere

The General is skeptical and not impressed as we

PUSH IN ON ION’S FACE -- his eyes and head twitch slightly

EXT BEACH - DAY 1984

An empty beach on a cold cloudy day A little girl YOUNG
AMARA runs happily in the sand ahead of her MOTHER

MOTHER
Amara don’t go too far ahead

Suddenly her Mother WINCES IN PAIN -- something’s very wrong
inside Quivering she lights a cigarette walking further

Young Amara runs along then STOPS -- glances over at a LINE
OF DILAPIDATED OLD HUTS along the edge of the beach

THERE -- in the shadows of one hut SOMETHING moves
Something about the size of a person but not WATCHING HER

BEHIND Amara’s Mother FREEZES IN PAIN -- a STROKE takes her
She collapses silently into the sand waves LAPPING nearby

Amara WATCHES THE SHAPE move in shadow between the huts Then
Amara suddenly notices her Mother She runs to her scared

YOUNG AMARA
(shaking her)
Mommy Get up Please get up

Out of the shadows by the huts emerges A DEER -- tall and
striking It looks at her with an almost human intelligence

Helpless and alone Amara looks up meeting its gaze
AMARA
Help
INT UNDERGROUND LAB - DAY 1984
DR RIVERS
It seems like he can project his

consciousness almost anywhere
(MORE)

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
Yesterday he described a market in
Bombay exactly -- confirmed by us
That’s why he’s meditating so much
it’s like he’s not even locked up
General I think this guy’s psychic
ESP skillset is off the chart so
to speak

The General turns away from Dr Rivers and walks out
GENERAL
Fine Rivers set him up with ESP
handlers for Delta But I want
tactical info from him that I can
actually use

Dr Rivers nods and turns back to see Ion awake -- hes
sweating and wide-eyed Rivers presses the intercom

DR RIVERS (V0)
Everything okay Did you find
something
Ion is out of breath Looks like he’s seen a ghost

ION
It’s her

DR RIVERS (VO)
What You sure How do you know

Ion looks up at Dr Rivers through the window

ION
I just know She is what she is

TEACHER (VO) (PRE-LAP)
Amara Munro you listen to me
INT ORPHANAGE CLASSROOM
AMARA sits at a desk scared as OTHER GIRLS snicker
around her The NUN TEACHER is glaring at her from the front

TEACHER
Stop these lies There is NOT a
deer in this classroom You have
got to end this childishness
INT ORPHANAGE
AMARA is pushed around and HIT by some other girls --

They steal a pack of cigarettes from her pocket laughing

Amara licks her cut lip -- THE DEER in the shadows nearby

INT ORPHANAGE BATHROOM
AMARA lies in a bathtub in a small dingy bathroom She
is pale and looking at her wrists CUT OPEN AND BLEEDING

MATRON (V0)
(banging on the door)
Amara Open the door Amara

Amara ignores her SLOWLY WE PAN AROUND -- suddenly revealing
the startling sight of THE DEER standing close in the
bathroom staring at her - its BREATH DEEP and RHYTHMICAL

(feeble)
Who are you

BOOM The door breaks The Catholic MATRON enters sees her

MATRON
Oh noSomeone Call an ambulance

The Deer has disappeared Amara glances down at her wrists

INT ION’S CELL - DAY 1995

RIVERS is now 50 He enters to find Ion -- still the same
age But he seems to be having another of his panic attacks

ION
(anxious manic)
She’s suicidal She doesn’t
understand -- she doesn’t remember
It happens that way usually they
don’t remember previous lives it’s
like waking from a dream

DR RIVERS
Who What are you talking about

ION
Her The girl The one I’ve been
watching I don’t know what to do
what if she tries again

DR RIVERS
--Calm down okay Remember what we
talked about with this Breathe
(Ion nods calming)
Tell me who she is we could help

Ion looks at him a flicker of suspicion

INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - MODERN DAY

Amara glares at Ion from the passenger seat

AMARA
You told them about me

ION
No I never--

AMARA
--Who are you What gives you the
right to spy on people’s lives On
my life

Ion is quiet humbled by her outburst She almost feels bad

AMARA (CONTD)
My whole life I thought I was
insane -- like my life didn’t fit
me And the deer was everywhere
Watching me it was you
(Beat in thought)
You think I’m someone else

ION
No I know you You’re the one who
thinks she’s someone else

INT RUNDOWN PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTION - DAY 2009

Amara sits in a day room with other PATIENTS around her
She idly stares at a PERPETUAL MOTION office toy

Suddenly she looks up -- THE DEER CLOPS EERILY through the
room towards her staring at her All around it patients
amble around they do not see it at all

Tentatively Amara puts her hand out -- the Deer stays still

ANGLE ON HER HAND -- ALMOST TOUCHING ITS SNOUT

NURSE (0S)
Amara

Amara blinks the Deer is gone TWO AGENTS stand with the
Nurse staring at her

NURSE (CONTD)
These men would like to talk with
you You’re going to go on a little
trip with them okay

INT DR RIVERS’ LAB DAY 2009

Dr Rivers (now 60) enters to find Ion waiting guarded by
TWO SOLDIERS - and he’s angry

ION

What are you doing with her
DR RIVERS

What
ION

I was there when they took her
Chris I was there

DR RIVERS
Ion I’m sorry It was Colonel
Boden’s decision not mine

ION

(dark)
Stop it Take responsibility I
trusted you with what I can do I
tell you everything

(Beat)
You all think you’re keeping me
here that I’m some kind of lab
rat You don’t think I haven’t been
in a situation like this a thousand
times before I stay here because
I want to help you remember that

DR RIVERS
Look the girl is--

ION
--Amara

DR RIVERS

Excuse me
ION
Her name is Amara Munro You should
know that now you found her
(Beat)
How did you do it A psychic

Rivers sighs as if there’s no point lying to Ion

DR RIVERS
He said he could find you when
youtravelled

Ion nods and sits down with his head in his hands

ION
She’s nothing to do with you or
your research on me

DR RIVERS
We just want to ask her some
questions
(Pause exasperated)
Look at me Ion I’m an old man now
But look at you You’re the most
important scientific discovery in
history and no-one even knows you
exist You’ve changed the world
Parts from your ship are still
fueling the tech boom were
finally starting to understand most
of that But weve tested you for
sixty years and found nothing no
physical differences between you or
‘ anyone to explain why you don’t
age I want to understand you
you’re obsessed with her So

Rivers sits down a little upset

ION
Youre searching for something that
cannot be discovered
(Beat)
Are you going to tell her about me

DR RIVERS
Do you want me to We could even
arrange a meeting

Ion taps his foot nervously a little mania returning

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
Think about it okay We don’t have
a session today You’re meeting
with Colonel Boden now he wants to
ask you about something

Ion’s face darkens sensing something ominous

INT COLONEL BODEN’S OFFICE - DAY

Ion sits in an office -- that of base commander COLONEL BODEN
(40s) He’s young for his position a smart man brave

Outside the windows is A MILITARY BASE walled in and hidden
by thick evergreen forest You’d never know it was there

TITLE Loring Air Force Base North-East Maine USA

COLONEL BODEN
I gotta tell you Ion your ‘vision’
work is quite something You saved
that D-team you know that right
They wouldn’t have made it out
without your intel and there’s
sure as hell no way that we
couldve known the cave layout

ION
I was glad to help you

COLONEL BODEN

Not me -- them Those boys are on
their way back to Brunswick for
training leave a couple requested
to meet and thank you personally
‘Course that can’t happen but I’m
told rumor’s spreading about you
through all SOF outfits The ghost-
scout that’s what they call you

(Beat Ion is blank)
Listen we didn’t understand you
in the beginning But I feel like
were getting somewhere I want
more about the ‘how’ of your

(flipping through a file)
spirit-walking” Rivers told me
you think it’s innate everyone has
this ability I also want more ESP
tests done And I want to hear more
about what you’ve seen on these
other Earths the past ones and
especially the future ones

ION
They’re only future or past
relative to you It all exists
right now together In parallel
And my memory’s a little scattered

COLONEL BODEN
Right Well weve also rebooted the
tech lab going over your ship’s
wreckage again--

ION
--The lab in New York City

COLONEL BODEN
(surprised that he knows)

The yeah That lab We got in an
expert technician from Tokyo deals
with experimental super-conductors
He took the old data and shook up
the old theories he’s claiming he
can rebuild this device that he
can fix it Make it actually work

Ion becomes STRANGELY ANXIOUS unusual The mania again

ION
Whichwhat does it look like

COLONEL BODEN
They said it’s in a kind of glass
box about six inches square Any
idea what we’re talking about here

FLASHBACK Ion RIPS The Signal from his spaceship console

COLONEL BODEN (CONT’D)
“(reading notes)

I can barely understand this Dr
Ito thinks it’s a uh “modulator
acting within the zero point
field” I quote like “a quantum
transmission mechanism capable of
instantaneous communication across
space-time” So it’s a signal

FLASHBACK Ion quickly seals himself in his protective pod

COLONEL BODEN (CONTD)
Ion Are you okay

Ion suddenly JUMPS out of his chair Boden flinches alarmed -
-TWO MINDERS at the back of the room start to attention

Ion breathes fast eyes flicking like he’s trapped in memory

ION
I broke it for a reason I told you
people already I told the others
before you They will come if you
turn it on

COLONEL BODEN
Ion it’s a signal right
Communication with a parallel Earth
could be beneficial

ION
I need more time She’s here

COLONEL BODEN
Who Amara

ION
--Don’t turn it on

MINDER 1 touches Ion on the shoulder

MINDER 1
Ion calm dow--

In a FLASH Ion SNAPS Minder 1s arm around flattening him
into the floor with EXPERT SKILL

Colonel Boden jumps up in shock -- no idea Ion could do this

GUARD 2
Hey

Minder 2 GRABS Ion -- CRACK Ion skillfully kicks out his
knee turns and SHOVES HIM into the window SMASHING it
Boden pushes a SECRET BUTTON on his desk

ION
(vicious commanding)
I told your predecessors -- you can
try all the parts but not that
one They will come here

SOLDIERS rush into the office -- Ion instinctively beats off
the first two without looking -- then he suddenly stops
stands there staring at Colonel Boden no resistance

ION (CONTD)
Don’t

ZAP They tazer Ion to the ground unconscious

COLONEL BODEN
(shocked)
You ever seen him do anything like
that before

GUARD 1
Never sir never

Colonel Boden shakes his head in disbelief troubled He
looks at Ion as they pick him up -- HIS EYES TWITCHING
EXT WATERFALL POOL FOREST WORLD - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
NATIVE ION and Alice BURST up above the surface of a deep

fallen asleep head resting against the door clothes sooty
and torn He watches her gently breathing for a few seconds

CLOSE UP HER EYES TWITCH - DREAMING REMEMBERING

EXT LORING MILITARY BASE MAINE - SUNSET

Loring Base has one small runway hangars admin buildings
gas silos an array of military vehicles and high walls All
completely hidden by dense wild Maine forest

A dark civilian HELICOPTER arrives and touches down Agents
lift a HOODED AMARA down leading her into one building
INT MEDICAL EXAM ROOM MAINE BASE - NIGHT

Amara’s hood is removed -- she squints in the bright lights
seated in the middle of a large medical room

AMARA
What is this

Opposite her sits Dr Rivers holding a file Behind him are
TWO YOUNGER LABCOATED ASSISTANTS a guy and a girl
24

DR RIVERS
Ms Munro I’m Dr Christopher
Rivers Wed like to ask you a few
questions maybe run some small
tests

AMARA
Tests Why I wasn’t admitted here

DR RIVERS
No you werent

Amara stares at him in growing apprehension Helpless

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
Were a special research division
of the US Military We’d just like
to ask you a few questions

AMARA
No Why should I have to--

PAVLE MIHALIC (0S)
--How often do you see the Deer

SILENCE Stunned Amara turns to see that the PSYCHIC —-
PAVLE MIHALIC had been beside her the whole time He’s
bald with sharp intelligent eyes Wears a cardigan

AMARA
(afraid)
What did you say

PAVLE MIHALIC

(EEuropean accent)
Youre visited by a Deer It looks
real of course to those alert
enough to notice Most wouldn’t see
it -- people these days have a
disease called the mind clogging
their perception with worry
wanting and fear

(Beat rubs his head)
But someone has visited you in that
form Shamanic journeys spirit-
walks astral-travel -- these are
all related to this process It is
a manifestation of a person’s
Presence outside of their body
Unbound by physical limitations
one can be carried wherever or to
whoever one intends

(MORE)

PAVLE MIHALIC (CONTD)
It takes years of practice but
your visitor is clearly very
gifted We know you see a Deer
More importantly we believe you
So the question is how often does
he visit you

Amara is in shock
DR RIVERS

Miss Munro this is Mr Pavle
Mihalic He’s aconsultant

AMARA
This isn’t a joke
DR RIVERS
No This is not a joke
AMARA
He saidit’s real and that it’s
a person
DR RIVERS
Yes ma’am He’s here in this
facility
AMARA
«what
DR RIVERS

Let me tell you what this is really
about If you cooperate with us
you might get to meet him

INT ION’S CELL - SAME TIME

Ion crawls back from under his cot with a paper packet He
opens it anxiously taking out THE PHOTO and looking at it

MOMENTS LATER

He sits on his bed still He closes his eyes BREATHES IN
EXHALESbreath DEEPENING sounding like an animal

A whole secret floor of the building Few windows Some
SCIENTISTS at desks checking computer monitors

In the center -- THE SIGNAL box from Ion’s ship DR ITO

it -- cables and complex equipment everywhere

Dr Ito checks it over finishing up a few connections
CLOSER IN -- there’s a tiny WHITE LIGHT inside PULSING
INT COLONEL BODEN’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Colonel Boden sits at his desk troubled Flipping through
PAGES of reports on Ion We see snippets of articles

“DNA sequencing normal No obvious differences
“symptoms of schizophreniaaltered perception of time”

And finally --

“mever any sign of hostility”

Boden thinks for a moment Then he picks up the phone

INT MILITARY LAB NYC - CONTINUOUS (SPIRIT-WALK)

A phone starts RINGING Dr Ito looks but his hands are full -
- on the screen behind him “TEST SEQUENCE INITIATED

THE PHONE -- still RINGSan ASSISTANT moves to answer it

INT ION’S CELL - NIGHT
Dr Rivers comes into the dark cell - Ion GRABS HIM hard
ION
(growls)

time-wasting Where is she

DR RIVERS
It’s just a blackout what’s wrong

ION
Youre wrong This is it -- I have

to go They’re coming and this
isn’t about you anymore

DR RIVERS
Okay calm down Who Who is coming

The door opens again -- Col Boden enters with FOUR ARMED
SOLDIERS outside Ion glares at him accusatory

COLONEL BODEN
(apologetic)
I tried to stop them It was just a
small diagnostics test

ION

(getting more anxious)
It’s too late The signal isn’t
like anything you have they
receive it as if before it’s even
sent It’s on and they’re coming
for me right now They’1l find me
here And you all now have a
serious problem

DR RIVERS
What is going on What is he
talking about

COLONEL BODEN
The ‘signal’ from his ship The
blackout is nationwide practically

ION

(intense)
Listen to me First comes a small
group they’re faster than the
others They’re not like us I mean

unconscious and violent Theyre
radicals

COLONEL BODEN
Radicals Ion you’re losing it

ION

I dont know who they are But they
keep chasing and they’re not afraid
to die They follow my signals
they’re trying to stop me because
Ibecause they know I’m crashing
down on purpose

(changing subject)
I have to go And if they find her
they’11 kill her too because

(glances at Dr Rivers)
--she’s connected to me

Dr Rivers opens his mouth to ask something but is cut off--

ALARMS SOUND RED LIGHTS start STROBING in the hallways Ion
releasesCol Boden ARMED SOLDIER 1 touches his earpiece

ARMED SOLDIER 1
Unknowns breaching our airspace

COLONEL BODEN
That’s it everybody topside

Ion has backed away into the far corner of the room --
staring at something in the dark hallway Rivers notices

DR RIVERS
Ion Are you okay

POV ION WALKING SLOWLY THROUGH THE RED FLASHING LIGHTS -- A
LARGE WOLF EMERGES MELTING FROM SHADOWS LOOKING AT ION

It looks real The others don’t see it -- a SPIRIT-WALKER

ION
They’re already here

BOOM A LARGE IMPACT above ground The Wolf looks at Ion --
and with almost human irony it slowly cocks its head at him

‘DR RIVERS
(scared re impact)
What the hell was that

COLONEL BODEN
Let’s go now
(turning to Ion)
Ion You’re the only one who knows
what’s happening here Talk to me

Ion looks back at the doorway but the Wolf is gone Ion’s
eyes flasha new side of him Dark Ready for war

ION
I have to find Amara

INT UNDERGROUND HALLWAYS - MOMENTS LATER

Double swing- -doors BURST OPEN -- Col Boden Dr Rivers and
Ion rush into the DARK HALLWAYS led by the FOUR ARMED
SOLDIERS in the eerie flashing

Boden carries a PISTOL in one hand and a RADIO in the other
The radio CHATTERS constantly but strangely staticky --
sounds like a war zone “taking fireI cant see
themgas reserves are blown in hangar 2shooting

Above and outside we hear MACHINE-GUN FIRE and the OCCASIONAL
SMALL EXPLOSION Col Boden YELLS into his crackling radio

COLONEL BODEN
This is Colonel Boden Christ
someone answer me

They reach an ELEVATOR but the POWER’S OFF

ARMED SOLDIER 1
Stairs are this way

ARMED SOLDIER 2
What the hell’s happening up there

COLONEL BODEN

(radio chatter contd)
Ion what is attacking us

ION
--STOP Everyone

Ion halts Dr Rivers Ahead is a FIRE DOOR to the stairs
There’s a small window in the door but DARK BEHIND

BURST OF GUNFIRE in the stairwell above Then a SCREAM THUD
and a BODY FALLING The Soldiers aim their guns at the door

ION (CONTD)
(quiet)
We need to find another way
upright now

For a second nobody moves EM-lights flicker DARK
BOOM The Fire Door FLIES OFF ITS HINGES -- hits Soldier 3
HIS GUN GOES OFF -- A SCREAM from Soldier 2 as SOMETHING
slides out through the shadows CUTTING HIM -- BLOOD FLIES--

ION (CONTD)
RUUUN

Ion pulls Rivers and starts SPRINTING AWAY -- Col Boden
turns after them -- Soldier 4s assault rifle BARKING behind

ION (CONTD)
This way

Ion knows the base as well as anyone -- turns sharply into

INT MILITARY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ion is AGILE leaps over a desk -- Dr Rivers TRIPS on a
chair but Col Boden picks him up from behind --

SCREEEAM Soldier 1s body FLIES past the doorway behind his
GUNFIRE briefly illuminating the dark -- then NOTHING

DR RIVERS
(terrified)
Oh my god oh my god

Boden glances ahead where Ion reaches a CLOSED DOOR on the
other side of the room PAUSES strangely and then

--KICKS the door open -- HITTING SOMETHING on the other side

ION
(quick to Boden)
GO Left then left -- closet door
I’1l meet you in--

The door EXPLODES in against Ion coming off its hinges and
knocking him down SOMETHING YANKS him OUT AROUND into the
hallway to the RIGHT Boden and Rivers pause then RUN out
through the door TO THE LEFT --

INT UNDERGROUND HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS

Rivers glances back -- sees TWO SHADOWS fighting in the gloom
-- SICKENING THUDS SERIOUS STRENGTH AND ABILITY

Boden and Rivers turn into another hallway RUNNING FAST

They turn another corner -- Rivers grabs Boden --
DR RIVERS
Wait Work closet door -- Ion said

He tries the handle on a MAINTENANCE CLOSET DOOR LOCKED

MOVEMENT behind them Boden swings around with his pistol --
SNAP He’s disarmed instantly and skillfully

ION
It’s me

In the strobing lights Ion’s face BLEEDS his shirt SLASHED
badly across the chest He doesn’t even seem to notice

DR RIVERS
(looking at him shocked)
My god

COLONEL BODEN
She’s in building 23 I don’t know
how we get up if there are more of--

BOOM Ion KICKS in the maintenance door pulls them inside

INT MAINTENANCE CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

Buckets brooms cleaning equipment In the back against the
far wall -- A LADDER leading up to a HATCH above

ION
This way

Col Boden glances at Rivers -- How does he know all this

EXT MILITARY BASE MAINE - MOMENTS LATER
Boden and Rivers hurry to keep up - Ion rushes over the base

BODIES lie everywhere some buildings on fire jeeps burning
It’s QUIET the base’s small personnel seem dead or fleeing

They pass a CAR-SIZED SLEEK BLACK POD like Ion’s emergency
crash pod but bigger stuck in the earth like a meteor crash

EXT BUILDING 23 - MOMENTS LATER

Ion leads them inside BUILDING 23 a small barracks on the
edge of the woods -- a hall lined with cots and lockers

CLICK A gun COCKS in the shadows at the far end Moving
closer -- they find Sgt Abernathy propped in a corner
BLEEDING BADLY With him are six SOLDIERS all spooked

COLONEL BODEN
What happened

SGT ABERNATHY
Bullets did nothing I think there
were two but they moved together--

ION
(anxious worried)
--Where is she Where’s Amara
Abernathy looks up deliriously Losing blood

SGT ABERNATHY
It’s you Theyre looking for you

Ion grabs him by the shoulders and drags him away slightly

ION
Thank you for hiding her

SGT ABERNATHY
We thought they were coming in
here

The soldiers watch in surprise at Ion’s apparent sixth sense

Underneath Ion feels the floorboards lifts up a HIDDEN TRAP
DOOR Inside under the floor Amara lies in a tiny space
amongst WEED BOOZE and PORN -- soldiers’ contraband stash

She looks up IN SHOCK someone’s blood on her But there’s
something reassuring about Ion like she’s known him forever

She takes Ion’s hand and he pulls her out The others watch
as he stares at her weirdly as if calming her with his eyes

ION
My name is Ion

She holds his gaze tears in her eyes Speechless she nods
THUD-THUD-THUDhelicopters approaching fast outside

SGT ABERNATHY
Brunswick We managed to call them
Theyre sending the D-boys

ION
We have to get out of here
Evacuate the base they’re still
here and they’11 kill anyone they
find

COLONEL BODEN
What are they Ion what could
possibly do this to us

ION
‘»-People They’re just people

Out the window -- TWO BLACK HAWKS touch down ELITE DELTA
TROOPS jump out LASER-SIGHTS slicing the darkness

EXT MILITARY BASE MAINE - NIGHT

Ion leads Amara quickly by the hand the others behind

The Deltas see them and rush over the squad leader is
CORPORAL ADAMS (30s) SNOW FALLS gently their BREATH STEAMS
in the cold

ADAMS
Come on Well set up a perimeter
Colonel Boden --
(quieter )
Who’s Ion and where do we find him

Nearby Ion and Amara stare -- THE WOLF is back moving calmly
between the oblivious troops Its eyes follow them spookily

ION
They know -- they’re coming GO

Ion pushes past pulling Amara inside the Black Hawk Deltas
scan the darkness as Rivers and Abernathy are loaded in
INT BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
ION
(frantic)
We have to leave RIGHT NOW
ANGLE ON AMARA --

She’s scared while in the bg we see a DARK SILHOUETTE rush
past the other Black Hawk and THROW SOMETHING into it--

BOOM The other chopper EXPLODES Flames lick the turning
propellers and the pilot struggles on fire

Ion watches in horror as the Deltas scramble to help their
dying comrades -- FIRING at something in the dark Col Boden
steps back off their helicopter also SHOOTING It’s chaos

Ion seems to realize what needs to be done
ION (CONTD)
(to Amara)
Let’s go

AMARA
What No

But he grabs her arm and starts to pull her out of the
helicopter Dr Rivers stops him--

DR RIVERS
Ion What are you doing

ION
(shaking off his grip)
This won’t work -- we have to go
(heartfelt)

Goodbye Chris I’ll see you again
As flames and guns CRACK around them Ion tows Amara away
sprinting unseen into the darkness
EXT PARKING LOT LORING BASE - NIGHT

Ion leads her terrified past slashed bodies into a small
parking lot hurrying between cars as snow begins to fall

They find a BLUE FORD EXPLORER Ion pauses at the NUMBER
KEYPAD on the driver’s door closes his eyesthen opens
them and types in the correct code The door UNLOCKS -

INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER LORING BASE - MOMENTS LATER

Amara sits in the passenger seat in shock Scared she
watches him break open the ignition and hot-wire the car He
DRIVES AWAY to the base gates with the lights off

Amara slowly turns and glances back In the distance flames
and tiny figures are still visible around the Black Hawks
when suddenly the burning one’s fuel finally -- EXPLODES
INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER — DAY (PRESENT)

Amara STARTS AWAKE with a GASP --

Still driving on the highway Ion looks over at her

ION
Did you have a nightmare

AMARA
---yeah

The RADIO is on in the background playing commercials

AMARA (CONTD)
Where are we

ION
New Hampshire I think

She looks at the car’s clock in surprise

AMARA
Jesus I was out for hours
ION
You were in shock You needed to

rest
The radio commercials end and a VOICE comes on

RADIO ANNOUNCER (V0)
---This is the BBC World Service on
satellite radio The top story
tonight a massive power outage has
hit the North American continent
now in its eleventh hour without
electricity while snow and freezing
temperatures continue over most of
the eastern United States

Amara looks out her window at snow banked by the freeway

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO) (CONTD)
officials are baffled as to the
cause of the blackout and for
hours there has been no further
comment from power companies or the
White House In Eastern cities
freezing weather without heating
has already led to several deaths
while in a snow-filled New York
crowds are gathering in protest and
large bonfires have been lit in the
streets Our correspondent Jane
Little has the report

Ion glances at Amara She seems sad staring out the window

JANE LITTLE (V0)
Anger and frustration are rife here
in Mid-Town Manhattan with rumors
also spreading of a possible
demonstration against the lack of
aid and information Nevertheless
it seems that hard times have also
brought out the best of the New
York spirit with a general air of
camaraderie and even--

Amara CLICKS off the radio and looks at Ion

AMARA
Where are we going

ION
New York City To find The Signal

AMARA
(frustrated angry)
New York The Signal I mean what
the hell are you talking about

Ion is almost scared to anger her He’s anxious uncertain

ION
I’m sorry please The Signal
isthe scientists turned it on
because it’s from my ship And they
didn’t know I need to get to it
because they’re coming the ones
who sent meI think

AMARA
You think You don’t know

ION

No yes--it’s likely I only know
two things that I am alive right
now and and that I

(stops looks at her)
They don’t want me to be here I’m
not supposed to leave orbit above
any Earth I find -- the ship is
automated and I’m just a failsafe

(confused)
I--didn’t I tell you this already
I’m supposed to scan the planet if
it’s suitable the Signal goes on
and they come Except I stopped it
and crashed

AMARA
Suitable For what to take it

ION
Its their Earth too They just
come from a different version

Amara rubs her head -- this is too much
AMARA
That’s them The men who attacked
the base

FLASHBACK IMAGE Azrayl coldly shoves Alice down in the
forest Ion pushes towards her -- but Azrayl SPEARS her

Anxious Ion blinks the vision away and touches the pendant
at his neck

EXT NEW YORK - NIGHT

The whole iconic city now strangely dark The TALL OFFICE
BUILDING hiding the lab within

A WHISTLING sound -- quiet at first building LOUDER

Above -- a SLEEK BLACK CRASH POD burns fast of the sky
SMASH Straight in the side of the building near the top

ION (VO) (CONTD)
It’s a small group so they’re less
easily tracked Some kind of early
response faction of the people who
sent me They’re here to kill me

INT MILITARY LAB NYC - NIGHT

Dr Ito sits in a chair now alone in the lab The Signal’s
pulsing glow in front of him disconnected from the wires

BOOM The building shakes from the IMPACT above Dr Ito
looks up slowly his face grave

MINUTES LATER

Movement in the darkness Ito shuffles away from The Signal
afraid edging backwards carefully QUIETLY

There -- in the pulsing light a FIGURE shimmers towards him
dark menacing -- coming closer straight towards Ito

DR ITO
Who are you

The Figure bends towards him -- the oscillating glow hitting
his face We’ve seen this outline before This is AZRAYL

Sharp features strong A warrior He wears black hooded
fatigues of a strange material

His head is shaved and the same geometric tattoos that cover
Ion’s torso crawl up his neck In his hand is a STRANGE METAL
TOOL -- cylindrical 12” long etched with the same patterns
Call it a SWYTHE

Azrayl crouches down as his gaze bores into Dr Ito’s soul

AZRAYL (SUBTITLE)
(perfect Japanese)
You are afraid

DR ITO (SUBTITLE)
---Yes

AZRAYL (SUBTITLE)
Of what Death

Dr Ito doesn’t say anything practically trembling

AZRAYL (SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
That is why we must help you
(Beat)
The Scout is not here

DR ITO (SUBTITLE)
Who

Azrayl ignores him stands up SNAP The metal inside the
Swythe quickly SHOOTS outward from the handle’s cylinder like
liquid or sand -- hardening into a KATANA BLADE

AZRAYL (SUBTITLE)
Do not be afraid it is only death
Do it yourself if youd prefer it
will help you accept it

Dr Ito takes the sword in his hands terrified Azrayl turns
and walks across the room slowly - THINKING FEELING

He turns around then sits down cross-legged on the floor
where he stood Closes his eyes takes a deep breath

But then he realizes something isn’t right -- opens his eyes
Dr Ito is still holding the sword Suddenly the blade melts
back into the hilt then pops out the other end straight
into Dr Ito’s heart killing him

Satisfied Azrayl closes his eyes again takes a deep breath
exhales -- the spirit-walk trance

-and a WOLF pads across in front of him into the shadows

EXT LORING MILITARY BASE MAINE - EARLY DAWN

A military Humvee RUMBLES out of the parking lot gentle snow
falling as FLAMES FLICKER from the burning buildings behind

ION (VO) (CONTD)
They wont hesitate to kill anyone
in their way They think they’re
helping That if you die you could
be reborn into eternity Into one
of their immortal Earths

The Humvee door opens and another “RADICAL” gets out He
wears the same outfit as Azrayl -- this is CETUS He

steps forward and stares into the quiet parking lot

PSYCHIC VISION Ion and Amara leaving in the stolen Blue SUV

Cetus doesn’t react as another one FORNAX emerges out of
the darkness behind him and loads weapons into the Humvee

Cetus and Fornax get into the Humvee and drive off heading
the same way that Ion did

BACK TO
INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - DAY
ION (CONTD)
death is nothing Just waking
from the dream of a previous life
Amara looks around -- suddenly claustrophobic and scared as

if realizing the absurdity of her situation

AMARA
This isn’t real Why me This is
nothing to do with me

Ion glances at her distressed by her anger

AMARA (CONTD)
Stop the car Let me out

ION
No Amara

AMARA
--You’re not real the Deer isn’t

same time Ion GRABS HER

ION
No Don’t

AMARA
Let go of me

ION
They’11 kill you They think you’re
the reason I keep crashing down on
purpose The reason I betray them

Amara looks at him her eyes blazing at him Shuts the door

AMARA
I-don’t--know--you

ION
Yes you do You just don’t

remember

Ion looks over at her but suddenly HIS VIEW IS DIFFERENT--

EXT FOREST WORLD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Instead he sees Alice standing beside him smiling She is
dressed in finer clothes flowers in her hair

She turns slowly looking lovingly at him Like a bride

Ion snaps to attention -- SOMETHING is in the road they’re
going to hit it But nothing happenslike nothing there

ION
What was it What did you see

I thought I saw a dog or a
wolfright in front of us

Ion looks at her He knows what that means He turns and
glances behind -- nothing yet

They can also ‘travel’ like me
And if one knows where we are they

weaving through traffic Amara turns and sees it too

AMARA
Oh my god

Determined Ion looks at her -- catching her gaze
ION
No matter what keep your eyes
open Listen to me if something
happensI will find you again
She looks at him as if not sure if she’s dreaming

BAM A car SLAMS INTO THEM from the next lane over -- Amara
SCREAMS -- Ion GRAPPLES WITH THE WHEEL glancing

around civilian traffic -- HONKING HORNS and SCREECHING TIRES

In the back -- Fornax has an ENTIRE ARSENAL OF STOLEN WEAPONS

ATTACHMENT and stands up to the open-roof firing position
INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - DAY

Ion drives like a god -- SCREECHES across four lanes flying
in front of Aquila to SQUEEEEZE between TWO 18-WHEELERS

The GRENADE SAILS PAST Ion’s windshield hitting a car in
front of them -- he SCREAMS past it with inches to spare --

AMARA
Shit Are they completely insane

AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from behind and the rear window explodes --

ION
Get down

He glances in his mirror -- Aquila’s Sedan pulls up from
behind on the left the Humvee further back on the right --
Fornax now BLASTING out of a window with the M4 rifle

Ion guns the engine cutting across the front of the Humvee
so they’re out of the rifle’s line of fire

Inside the cop is almost crushed calling for backup

INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - DAY

BOOM BOOM Ion races ahead weaving between exploding
vehicles as Fornax shoots from the Humvee behind them

Ion glances at Amara she’s terrified -- they’re in SERIOUS
TROUBLE they’re not going to make it through this But then
they hear ANOTHER SOUND GROWING LOUDER
THUD-THUD-THUD-THUD-THUD

Ion glances behind HOPE glimmering in his eyes to see

BURSTING through the thick wreckage SMOKE -- a BLACK HAWK
HELICOPTER roars in LOW AND FAST over the cars on the freeway
like a GIANT SHARK HUNTING MINNOWS

The Deltas are back

INT BLACK HAWK - SAME TIME
The same squad that came to the rescue at the Maine base

ADAMS (30s) is the leader VAUGHN -- bit of a joker
wears a red bandana-headband and his lucky Aviators hooked
into his tactical vest and DUTCH is a silent badass
With them are FIVE OTHERS All GEARED UP packing elite
customized weapons Oakley eyewear

Carnage and burning cars blur past the open doors below

Prepare to engage
INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - CONTINUOUS

Ion quickly maneuvers himself between the Sedan and the
Humvee as the Black Hawk ROARS up next to them

AMARA
They’re here to help us right

ION
Hold on This isn’t over

He checks his rear-view mirror clear behind and SLAMS ON
THE BRAKES --

EXT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Sedan and Humvee FLY PAST Ion’s rapidly-slowing SUV --
but the Black Hawk stays with them Aquila looks up from his

car at the Deltas in the helicopter next to him -- oh shit

ADAMS (V0)
Waste that motherfucker

A Delta on the Blawk Hawk’s MINIGUN fires -- TEARS IT APART

INT AQUILA’S SEDAN - SAME TIME

--But Aquila PULLS HIS HOOD OVER HIS HEAD wrapping his hands
inside his clothes and suddenly the black fabric HARDENS INTO
A KIND OF PROTECTIVE SHELL just in time as--

EXT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

The destroyed Sedan careens into the central divider at speed
-- Aquila flies through the windshield INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC--

--he’s hit by a car which SMASHES against his PROTECTIVE
SHELL sending him flying again

As the shell slows on the shoulder the material suddenly
softens again and Aquila rolls out ONTO HIS FEET unhurt

INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - DAY

Ion’s SUV stops in the middle of the freeway with cars
backing up behind as Ion checks Amara

ION
Are you okay

AMARA
No Where’d you learn to drive like
that

ION
I don’t remember it just comes to
me I’ve been to a lot of Earths

Amara sees Aquila jump the central divider ahead and start
sprinting back towards them the Swythe handle in his hand

AMARA
Ton

Ion throws the car into drive -- steps on it But Aquila
SNAPS his SWYTHE liquid metal melts out instantly forming
into a HOOK which he smashes through Ion’s rear-left window --
dragging him with the SUV as it GAINS SPEED

EXT HIGHWAY -— DAY

Up ahead Cetus throws the Humvee into a SCREECHING hand-
brake turn through the slush to head back towards Ion --
forcing the pursuing Black Hawk into a RADICAL BANKED TURN

The Deltas stop FIRING forced to hold on tight as the
chopper banks and the world outside the doors BLURS PAST
EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

The Humvee ROARS at speed dodging oncoming traffic as

INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - CONTINUOUS

Ion speeds towards it distracted by Aquila HEAVING HIMSELF
in through the window into the backseat Amara watches in
horror -- Ion CLICKS ON THE CRUISE-CONTROL --

ION
Take the wheel Take it

She grabs it from her seat as Ion jumps into the BACKSEAT --
BAM He hits Aquila HARD -- they grapple VIOLENTLY -- Ion
gets an upper hand for a second

ION (CONTD)
(to Amara)
Drive Don’t stop no matter what

AMARA
What are you doing No Don’t--

Then Ion YANKS the hood over Aquila’s face closes his eyes --
Aquila’s clothing HARDENS AGAIN into the shell and without
hesitationIon SHOVES THEM BOTH OUT THE DOOR

EXT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Ion falls out onto Aquila’s HARD CLOTHING SHELL at 80mph --
dragging in the doorway a second to stabilize then SLIDING
away on the tarmac as OTHER CARS SWERVE to avoid them

The shell softens into clothing again -- and Aquila is on his
feet -- ANGRY HITTING at Ion with ELBOWS and KNEES -- both
fighting with the skill of battle-hardened warriors

INT BLUE FORD EXPLORER - DAY

FRANTIC Amara climbs over into the drivers seat She ‘looks
up -- the Humvee is RACING STRAIGHT AT HER suicidally No
time -- she PULLS HER SEATBELT ON and SWERVES --

INT BLACK HAWK SAME TIME

Adams watches from above as Amara JUST MISSES the Humvee but
HITS another WRECKED VEHICLE -- launching the SUV UP INTO THE
AIR spinning and CRASHING onto its ROOF

ADAMS
PUT US DOWN THERE NOW

PILOT (V0O)
Sir the package was clear of the
vehicle--

ADAMS
Put us down

EXT SUV CRASH HIGHWAY - DAY

The Black Hawk HOVERS above Amara’s crash -- Adams Vaughn
Dutch and THREE OTHERS LEAP DOWN as the MINIGUN RIPS INTO the

Adams gets to the overturned SUV sees Amara strapped inside

ADAMS
Hey Miss

She turns her head groggily -- ALIVE He crawls in through
the window to reach her
EXT HUMVEE - DAY
Cetus falls from the wreck taking cover as Deltas’ bullets
DEAFENINGLY CRACK into the Humvee’s armored body Nearby
Fornax reloads a rifle and hands it to Cetus
CETUS
(totally calm)
Get rid of that helicopter

Fornax grabs a BAZOOKA as Cetus RETURNS FIRE at the Deltas

EXT FORD EXPLORER CRASH HIGHWAY - DAY

Adams pulls Amara free of the wreck -- bullets PING and SNAP
all around them The other Deltas take cover behind the SUV

ADAMS
(into radio)
Get us out of here we need EVAC

The Black Hawk starts to circle back when --

DUTCH
R-P-G

They dive for cover as an RPG trails through the air over
their heads BOOM Hits the TAIL of the Black Hawk

The helicopter SPEWS BLACK SMOKE SPINS low over their heads
and CRASHES into the opposite side of the freeway where a MAC
TRUCK SLAMS into it -- and it BURSTS INTO FLAMES

LEGS SPRINTING -- Fornax rushes on foot unseen from the
Humvee to the SUV CRASH during the confusion

He LEAPS into the MIDDLE OF THE DELTAS -- BLOWING AWAY Delta
4 point-blank with his rifle trying to hit Amara --

VAUGHN
Holy shit

They turn and SHOOT -- but Fornax has already pulled his hood
over his face activating his robes to become the SHELL
Bullets RICOCHET off it and one HITS DELTA 5 in the leg

DELTA 5
(falling)
Mother-fuck Cease fire

But as they do Fornax spins out of his shell like a ninja a
KATANA SWORD SNAPPING out of his Swythe handle and SLASHING
DELTA 6’s neck he kicks Adams away -- and pins Amara to the
ground his eyes COMPLETELY COLD UNEMOTIONAL

The Swythe SNAPS again and the long sword becomes a shorter
KNIFE -- and as Fornax stabs downBAM Vaughn SMACKS him in
the head with his rifle sending Fornax reeling and fumbling

Vaughn and Dutch SHOOT Fornax’s chest before his robes can
harden KILLING HIM

Adams picks Amara up when --

DELTA 5 (CONTD)
GRENADE

ANGLE ON A grenade rolls out of Fornax’s lifeless hand into
the middle of them -- there’s not enough time

DELTA 5 leg wounded throws himself on top of itBOOM

EARS RINGING SHOCKED - Adams Vaughn Dutch and Amara pick
themselves up dripping with soot and slush Vaughn stares at
Delta 5s remains Dutch checks Delta 6’s body his neck cut

DUTCH
He’s gone too

Adams glances across the highway at the Humvee wreck --
there’s no-one there Cetus is gone

BOOM The CRUSHED Black Hawk on the other side of the highway
EXPLODES -- no-one would survive it

VAUGHN
(freaking out)
Are you kidding Are you fucking
kidding man What just happened

ADAMS
Come on we’re getting out of here
We can’t get slowed down by the
cops Vaughn

Vaughn turns to him visibly upset

VAUGHN
That’s it Three of us The whole
fucking team’s gone How the fuck
did that happen--

ADAMS
(stern)
--Save it We’ve got to go Geta
car quickly

Dutch pulls Vaughn and together they run towards a stopped
Porsche Cayenne an ARROGANT BUSINESSMAN inside staring

ADAMS (CONTD)
(to Amara)
Are you hurt

She shakes her head in shock Her face bruised shirt ripped

AMARA
Where is Ion

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

Further down the highway -- Aquila SLAMS Ion into the tarmac
Traffic is backed up down the highway amazed onlookers

AQUILA
What are you doing here with them
Why don’t you do what you’re told

Ion struggles underneath him kicks Aquila’s legs out and
gets to his feet as Aquila’s swythe SNAPS into a thin metal
blade Aquila spins it with skill -- SLICING ION’S SIDE

Ion ducks under a blow and gets in close -- kicking out
Agquila’s leg with a SNAP and TACKLING HIM onto the hood of a
car TWO GUYS (20s) get out to try and break up the fight

CAR GUY 1
Hey c’mon guys break it up--

Aquila’s Swythe-staff CRACKS HIM in the face -- Ion fights to
restrain Aquila protecting the civilians

ION
(shouts at other guy)
Get away from here

Ion gets the upper hand as Aquila fights to get away -- Ion
catches him and SLAMS his head through a car window He choke-
holds Aquila

AQUILA
»-she’s not the one Ion She’s not
your wife none of them are You’re
lost out here Come in with us

Ion wrestles him to his knees tightening his grip

AQUILA (CONT’D)
(choking)
Can you do this forever
We’llkeep coming for you Ion

Ion ignores him -- his face ashen almost evil Aquila
flails accidentally grabbing hold of Ion’s LEATHER PENDANT
and ripping it from his neck

Aquila almost double-takes glancing at the pendant in his
hand with SHOCK Ionnoticesand has to act quickly

ION
Until next time then

SNAP Ion breaks his neck He quickly opens Aquila’s hand
retrieves the pendant and picks up the SWYTHE HANDLE As he
stands up he sees a terrified family inside the nearest car

BEEP BEEP Ion turns to see the Porsche Cayenne speeding
back down the highway towards him honking the horn

INT CAYENNE - DAY

Adams is driving Vaughn in the passenger seat his assault
rifle aimed out the window Ion climbs into the back seat
next to Dutch and Amara The Deltas’ wet combat gear squeezes
in awkwardly with the luxury leather interior

In the distance a SWARM of country cops are pushing slowly
through the grid-locked traffic SIRENS WAILING

VAUGHN
(somber)
Okay man drive Get us the hell
out of here

Yeah

EXT HIGHWAY - SAME TIME

IN THE FOREST off the side of the highway -- Cetus watches as
they speed off a nearby exit Moments later the cops arrive
INT CAYENNE - DAY

The clouds start to thin as the sun dips lower in the sky
Adams drives down rural back-roads Dutch ever-watchful for
any cops All of them are SILENT

Amara glances at the Deltas apprehensively Then she turns to
Ion -- he looks at her his face pale and cut up The Swythe
handle in his hand

ION
Are you okay

She nods noticing his labored breathing Suddenly she looks
down -- blood is seeping into her jeans coming from Ion

AMARA
Oh my god

The others look back as Ion reels his eyes glazing over

VAUGHN
What’s wrong

Amara peels back Ion’s shirt -- a gash across his left side

AMARA
He’s bleeding he’s cut bad

DUTCH
Let me see it

AMARA
We have to get him to a hospital--

ADAMS
--How bad is it

DUTCH
Ion Ion look at me

But Ion is fading fast losing consciousness

DUTCH (CONTD)
(to Adams)
Find us a place to pull off the
road I can’t help him in the car
(to Amara)

Here put your hands there and

pinch it Hard Keep pressure on

it
Amara pushes her hands into Ion’s side His blood seeps
between her fingers She looks up at him as his eyes close
EXT FOREST WORLD - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Redwoods tower against a sky full of brilliant stars NATIVE
ION sits pensively back to a massive ancient tree trunk
INT LARGE TEPEE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK )
Alice lies awake on a bed of furs inside a skin-covered tent
6-7 OTHER TRAVELLERS are asleep around her Alice stares
absentmindedly at a FAT WOMAN SNORING beside her
Suddenly she hears a noise outside and CLOSES HER EYES
The door flap opens and a familiar silhouette appears Ion
creeps in searching in the dark for Alice He carefully
steps near the Fat Woman when SHE SUDDENLY SNORTS and rolls
over onto his foot -- Ion panics loses balances and falls
He just manages to stop from slamming into the floor landing
comically contorted face to face with Alice -- who eyes
closed in mock-sleep can’t stop herself GIGGLING

He grins takes her hand and SILENTLY helps her up out of the

bed Together they creep out of the tent

EXT FOREST WORLD - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

They hurry deep into the forest’s tall trees happy

EXT HILLTOP FOREST WORLD - LATER (FLASHBACK)

Ion and Alice stand side-by-side at the top of a high cliff
above the forest They both stare out at something

The forest stretches far away under the moonlight and
starlight But in the distance some stars are FALLING’ Not
stars they’re like meteorsseven of them

They FLAME out of the sky and crash into the forest

ALICE (SUBTITLE)
(in their language)
What are they Ion

Ion is scared frustrated -- his anxiety coming in She takes
his hand and he looks at her She smiles and kisses him

ION
(in English)
I love you

ALICE (SUBTITLE)
What What did you just say

She’s stunned not understanding But he seems equally
confused by his use of English

ION (SUBTITLE)
«--I I dont know

ALICE (SUBTITLE)
Are you alright

He glances out where the pods crashed then shakes his head --
becoming upset

ION (SUBTITLE)
Noits them Something terrible
is going to happen here

ALICE (SUBTITLE)
What are you talking about

He looks at her full of apprehension

ION (SUBTITLE)
They are coming for us now We
must run again

ALICE (SUBTITLE)
Again Who is coming Ion youre
scaring me

ION (SUBTITLE)
I have always loved you Trust me

He takes her hand and starts to lead her away into the
forest hurryingthen fasterthen RUNNING

INT BARN - EVENING

The barn is more like an extra garage than an agricultural
store It’s filled with junk -- chairs tables bags boxes
rusty bicycles and shelves filled with THOUSANDS OF BOOKS

Ion lies asleep on a table while Dutch stitches up his wound
Amara sits on the floor against some boxes watching

AMARA
So what is this A rescue mission

DUTCH
More of a recovery mission

AMARA
Who are you supposed to be Navy
SEALS or something

Dutch doesn’t look at her just aims his Maglite to keep
working on Ion

DUTCH
Or something

Amara waits but realizes he’s not going to talk much more
AMARA
What’s next Ion says we have to go
to New York and find this Signal

DUTCH
Adams is in charge

AMARA
Adams Which one are you

DUTCH
Dutch

EXT FARMHOUSE - SAME TIME

Adams peers inside the windows of the house that’s near the
barn it’s all quiet Vaughn comes from around another
corner

ADAMS
Anything

VAUGHN
There’s no car Nobody’s home

They start back along the house towards the barn

VAUGHN (CONTD)
What are we doing here This whole
mission is fucked not to mention
completely illegal

ADAMS
Everything we do is illegal it’s
just not done on American soil

VAUGHN
Yeah well the others are dead on a
freeway probably live on CNN You
don’t get that other places And
for what -- some whackjob the
bosses want alive

Adams stops him and lowers his voice stern

ADAMS
We follow orders that’s our job
right Those bald bastards fell out
of the sky and destroyed Loring
base They’re like goddamn aliens
or something -- I don’t know about
you but right now I wanna know how
Many there areand I’m gonna kill
them As for that ‘whackjob’ in
there we all might’ve died on the
Sarkani Op if it wasn’t for him and
his intel

VAUGHN
(stunned guilty)
That was him He’s the ghost

ADAMS
That was him
INT BARN - EVENING

Amara gets to her feet and walks to the table looking at
Ion She gingerly pokes his leg then taps his pants pocket

DUTCH
What are you doing

Amara ignores him and reaches into Ion’s pocket pulling out
the folded PHOTOGRAPH Slowly she opens it and looks at the
woman in the picture Curious Dutch pauses and peeks at it

DUTCH (CONTD)
Is that you

Amara stares -- it does have a strong resemblance to her

AMARA
No That would be impossible

She abruptly folds it again and puts it in her own pocket

AMARA (CONTD)
So what do you know about him

DUTCH
(cont stitching)
It’s classified

AMARA
Classified You know who I am

DUTCH
You’re Amara Munro you’re a
psychiatric patient You were with
him

AMARA
(irritated by this)
I’m not ‘with him’

Then the door CREAKS and Adams enters the barn from outside
unhitching his assault rifle from his shoulders

ADAMS
Were clear out there Vaughn’s
gonna keep watch How’s he doing

DUTCH
The wound wasn’t too deep It’s
weird that he’s still out though
he can’t have lost that much blood

Adams walks up next to Amara looks at her softly

ADAMS
You okay You should rest a little

AMARA
Why Because I’m the girl

He looks at her surprised and attracted by her tenacity as
she matches his eyes

AMARA (CONTD)

What are we doing here Why don’t
you guys call for backup or
something What if they come here

Adams glances at Dutch who shrugs slightly -- tell her

ADAMS
This is a Black Op You need
congressional clearance for a
military incursion on US soil but
with the timing and the fact that
Ion is an asset classified top
secret they couldn’t afford to ask
for it Only a handful of people
know we’‘re here Radio silence from
here on Unregistered weapons no
IDs if we get caught

AMARA
So what this is illegal

ADAMS
Were not getting any help

AMARA
What What about the helicopter
that blew up on the freeway

ADAMS
Probably be called a training
exercise malfunction

AMARA
That’s insane OrI’m insane I
don’t know anymore

Amara goes quiet folding her arms in the cold Shes
shivering Adams starts unhooking all his gear

AMARA (CONTD)
Don’t I’m fine

He ignores her finally getting down to his jacket and giving
it to her She puts it on -- it’s big on her Sleeves dangle

AMARA (CONTD)
I wasn’t part of your mission was
I

Dutch and Adams glance at each other Amara catches it
knowing the truth -- she’s not meant to be there

AMARA (CONTD)
Thank you

She smiles slightly at Adams He nods back A connection

Dropping the subject Adams turns to Ion He pulls down Ion’s
shirt-collar a little looking at the intricate designs

ADAMS
Weird tattoos

Adams reaches to touch the leather-pendant when Ion’s eyes
suddenly OPEN WIDE He glances wildly at them then SHOUTS
and LEAPS off the table backing away from them

ION
(forest world language no
subtitles here)
WHO ARE YOU What are you doing to
me

ADAMS
Whoah Ion calm down

ION
Where am I

Adams tries to calm Ion down but he instantly swipes Adams’ -
legs out in a slick move knocking him down and backing away

ION (CONTD)
Dont touch me Who are you

Vaughn bursts in from outside hearing the commotion

VAUGHN
What the fuck is going on

AMARA
What’s wrong with him What is he
saying

Only then Ion seems to notice Amara Like someone just waking
from a dream he stares at her with vague recognition

ION
Speak again
(in perfect LATIN)
Talk What language do you speak

DUTCH
What language is that

ION
(he’s got it)
English American The United
States of America

VAUGHN
Yeah duh What the hell’s wrong
with him

ION -
Baalic Christian Tao

Ion is wary backing away watching them Slightly manic

VAUGHN
--Jewish He’s Christian She’s

Amara shoots him an look to say - shut up inappropriate

ION
How long have I been here

ADAMS
(getting up)
About twenty minutes We rescued

ION

AMARA
Sixty years roughly You don’t

VAUGHN

ADAMS
--Shut up Give him a second

Ion is staring at Amara -- trying to bring it back

ION
I found you In the forest

AMARA
Noyou found me on a beach

ION
(starting to get it)
On a beach
FLASH Young Amara at her mother’s body The Deer nearby

Ion suddenly checks the leather pendant at his neck then his
pockets -- looking for the photo Getting worried

ION (CONTD)
I don’t havedid I have a
(searching for the word)
picture A chemograph
Dutch glances at Amarabut she doesn’t move
Ion lifts the side of his shirt to see the stitched wound

ION (CONTD)
I’m bleeding

Ion stands still staring at it for a few long moments The

others glance at each other -- what is happening
ADAMS
Ion
ION

It’s okay I remember
He quickly looks up at Amara worried she too might be hurt

ION (CONTD)
Amara Are you--

He steps forward -- but she backs away instinctively moving
slightly behind Adams Ion stops ashamed

ION (CONTD)
I’m sorryI’ve been doing this a
very long time Lots of memories
Sometimes I get lost
(to Adams)
Sorry I hit you

Adams shrugs it off

ION (CONTD)
How far is it to New York

DUTCH
A couple hours

VAUGHN
New York Hey Adams is this an
extraction or what What’s New York
got to do with anything

ION
The Signal is there

Ion talks but his gaze keeps coming back to Amara

ADAMS
(sorry he lied to them)
It’s not an extraction We’re
supposed to help him do--whatever
it is he’s gotta do I’ve got the
secondary briefing

DUTCH
What do you mean whatever he needs
to do What does he need to do
Adams doesn’t have an answer they all look at Ion
ADAMS
Well what do we need to do
EXT MANHATTAN - NIGHT
We GLIDE above the iconic city now seemingly dark As we go
lower candles flicker in apartment windows The streets are
full -- people milling around with flashlights
EXT LOOTED HARDWARE STORE NYC - NIGHT

A Radical ORION steps out through a smashed window
carrying a FULL DUFFEL BAG The city is unusually QUIET

He walks quickly down the powerless snowy streets past KIDS
throwing snowballs at each other climbing on cars

IE UPPER WEST SIDE APT - NIGHT

CLICK Orion’s Swythe spits out a LOCKPICK -- he opens a door
and walks into a plush apartment The OWNER and his
GIRLFRIEND sit inside bundled up Candles -- romantic

APARTMENT OWNER
Hey Who the hell are you

Orions Swythe melts into a HATCHET -- he KILLS THEM BOTH He
opens the duffel cleaning chemicals car battery tools and
a digital alarm clock Ingredients for a HOMEMADE BOMB

10 MINUTES LATER
Orion packs up the tools and walks out leaving the bomb

ORION
That’s my last one set

EXT GAS STATION LOWER EAST SIDE - SAME TIME

Another Radical CORVUS uses his Swythe as a CROWBAR to
lever up the gas reserve cover and drops a BACKPACK inside

He walks away quickly Nearby a GROUP OF CIVILIANS are
complaining to NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS about the conditions

Small BANG Then a HUGE EXPLOSION -- the gas station IGNITES
People SCREAM as debris flies everywhere

The Nat Guard troops stare in amazement -- but then suddenly
ANOTHER EXPLOSION goes off at a COFFEE SHOP down the street

INT MILITARY LAB NYC - NIGHT

DEAD SWAT TEAM BODIES lie about bulletholes and flashbang
burns Maglites on MP5s -- scattered beams in the darkness

NYPD CHIEF (V0O) (RADIO)
Come in Blue Team Do you read me
Is anyone alive up there

Someone is alive -- AZRAYL spattered with blood walks past

the bodies His sleek LANDING POD sits in a nest of sparking

cables shattered glass and steel -- it crashed right through
the side of the building He picks up the GLOWING SIGNAL and

walks to a window

EXPLOSIONS RUMBLE -- Azrayl watches as BOMBS FLASH off all
across the darkened expanse of Manhattan below him

Then Azrayl senses something and slowly turns around There
among the bodies in the darkness of the lab stands Ion’s
DEER Its large dark eyes watch him with uncanny stillness

INT CAYENNE - NIGHT

Ion’s eyes POP OPEN with a GASP -- he’s in the car with the
others racing fast on a dark road Vaughn glances around

VAUGHN
He’s back This is too weird man

ION
We need to hurry up

AMARA
What did you see

Ion is troubled but grips the Swythe handle in his hand The
radio news BABBLES SOFTLY in the bg

ION
They’re bombing the city

ADAMS DUTCH
What New York city

ION (CONTD)

The Immortals arrive soon they
decide what happens And the
rampant fear will not help you

AMARA
The Immortals

ION
The people who sent me

VAUGHN
Great the more the merrier What
time do they join the party

I don’t know Soon They follow the
Signal too
Ion glances at Amara next to him longingly No reaction
Adams watches them in the rearview mirror
DUTCH

(to Adams)
Drive faster

VAUGHN
Who’re the Immortals what happens
when they get here

ION
They call themselves the People
Immortal the Kingdom of the
Heavens They are you Your
descendants from a parallel Earth
where there is no longer disease
or aging no death without
violence They are ever-expanding
across the multiverse When they
get here they will judge you
uncivilizedthis is conquest

There’s a few moments of SILENCE then Adams suddenly turns
off into a large empty STRIPMALL -- a WALMART at the end

ION (CONTD)
(suddenly anxious)
What are you doing

ADAMS
Cops and National Guard are all
over the city We need to look like
civilians if we’re gonna get
anywhere We all need new clothes

The Deltas start unbuckling their gear Ion looks down at his
ripped filthy clothes
INT WALMART - MOMENTS LATER

A LOCK BREAKS The five of them sneak in from the back It’s
dark eerie The Deltas CLICK on flashlights hand them out

ION
Back out in ten

ADAMS
Well be quick

The Deltas move off together leaving Ion and Amara alone

MOMENTS LATER Ion holds the light while Amara picks out a
new t-shirt It’s awkward between them

AMARA
(gestures)
Could you turn around

He turns away while she changes out of her ripped shirt into
a new one Then she grabs a warm hoodie and a jacket in hand

Ion turns back to face her She seems exhausted

ION
»-are you okay

She wheels on him upset Close to tears Glaring at him

AMARA

They tried to kill me Me
specifically Why Why would they
do that Ion

(Beat)
I’ve spent most of my life wishing
I was dead I hate this place this
world I feel like I don’t belong
here I have nothing here But
today I was afraid to die and that
sickens me

Ion turns away he doesn’t know how to explain

ION
I’m sorry that you can’t remember

They start walking towards some men’s clothes

AMARA
Remember what Ion

ION
Ive been looking for you for an
eternity It’s all I do find you
and lose you again

Ion starts searching a rack picks up a new top Amara shakes
her head in disbelief and takes the PHOTO from her pocket as
he carefully peels his shirt up from his wound

AMARA
You’re wrong Youve got the wrong
girl Ion I’m just Amara
(waving the photo)
This -- is not me

She stops stares in amazement at his lithe torso -- entirely
covered in a SUBTLE INTRICATE TATTOOED DESIGN A maze of
ancient and newer scars crisscross over the top of his skin

He steps in to her She grips the photo breath quivering --

ION
(re photo and her)
That is not this body But it is
your soul which determines a lot

She is nervous with him so close but still she does not move
as -- he slowly gently pulls her top down a little

A round birthmark sits above her left breast Seeing it seems
to confirm it finally to Ion who shuts his eyes letting go

FLASHBACK In the forest Ion fights forward as Azrayl pushes
Alice down -- spears herin the same place as Amara’s mark

Amara stands still hand shaking slightly as Ion turns away
from her upset

ION (CONTD)
Native marks are caused by texture
or wounds on a previous body
(Beat)
I can still-- I see you dying

Amara stares at him as he drops to his knees She crouches
close beside him to see his face -- eyes CLENCHED SHUT

ION (CONTD)
(whisper alien language)
I love you

Amara is confused not understanding His eyes twitch

EXT VILLAGE FOREST WORLD - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

Teepees and animal skin tents in a clearing deep within the
lush wild forest This world is startlingly beautiful

EXT COUNCIL FIRE FOREST WORLD - EVENING (FLASHBACK)

NATIVE ION sits with many other PEOPLE Some are dressed like
Ion they live here But others are TRAVELERS from another
culture Among them is ALICE sitting across from Ion

Everyone is listening to a Shaman HOWAHKAN (50s) He is a
thin man with bright eyes and a mischievous humor He’s
midway through a story in their language a tale well told

HOWAHKAN (SUBTITLE)
-but his punishment was not
death No no death is nothing
(MORE )

HOWAHKAN (SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
Death is easy For Sheefus the
spirits had something else in mind

The people smile Ion glances at his friend CHUA (30s)
sitting next to him Chua lounges on his back smiling

HOWAHKAN (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)
He was condemned forever to heave a
boulder up the Great Mountain
whose slopes are the same but
different each time you look at
them And when he reached the top
exhausted from his struggle the
boulder would slip and tumble down
the mountainside away from him And
poor Shee’ fus would start over in
an eternity of futile struggle

Alice looks over at Ion and smiles at him but Ion is more
serious now listening to Howahkan

HOWAHKAN (SUBTITLE) (CONT’D)

The spirits thought their torture
would be crushing But Sheefus was
no ordinary man and he defied the
spirits once again For he accepted
his fate he did not hope or want
for anything more than he had Thus
as he reached the bottom of the
Mountain again and glanced back at
the enormous task ahead of him
Sheefus was aware of himselfand
you know what he did He smiled

INT HOWAHKAN’S TENT FOREST WORLD - NIGHTFALL (FLASHBACK)
Ion catches up with Howahkan as he enters his hut

ION (SUBTITLE)
An old classic huh

Howahkan sits happy to see Ion -- shrugs off his comment

HOWAHKAN (SUBTITLE)
They say it’s been two hundred
years since you came to us Ion I
don’t know if thats true but I do
know you have been my friend my
entire life I still remember when
you told that story to me when I
was just a boy and you were still
as you are now

Ion comes inside and sits down next to him

HOWAHKAN (SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
How can you be sure it is her that
she is really the one

ION (SUBTITLE)
She loves me She doesnt remember
it yet but I cannot forget her

see of people than flesh and blood
It is her

Howahkan looks at his old friend earnestly
HOWAHKAN (SUBTITLE)

Ion looks at Howahkan smiling and pats him on the shoulder
as if to say -- thank you

INT WALMART - NIGHT

Ion opens his eyes in the darkened store to find Amara
crouched next to him her hand on him shaking him awake

She’s peering down an aisle anxiously EERIE SILENCE

ION
(whisper)
Amara

She turns to him suddenly to silence him -- she SCARED
SOMETHING’S WRONG They WHISPER QUIETLY

ION (CONTD)
What is it

AMARA
--Shhh Can you stop blacking out
on me please Something’s in here

ION
Where are the others

AMARA
I don’t know

Carefully Ion rocks onto his feet staying low Together they
start to slowly move away down the aisle

A PITTER-PATTER of feet in the darkness A SHADOW FLITS past
another aisle Ion spins in the dark seeing nothing

Suddenly they stop peering around a corner

POV ION A LARGE WOLF sits on its haunches in the middle of a
walkway in the dark -- PANTING -- peering around

Ion pulls them a different way -- but ANOTHER WOLF jogs past
searching the store They’re closing in on all sides

Ion looks -- he can see the backdoor where they came in Then
they hear DIFFERENT FOOTSTEPS in the store a man’s

The radical CETUS walks the aisles slowly as the spirit-
wolves run around him His hood is drawn face in shadow

ION
(whisper )
We have to runare you ready

Amara shakes her head no But suddenly Ion pulls her up and
they start SPRINTING FOR THE DOOR
EXT WALMARTSUV - MOMENTS LATER

The three Deltas are in the car already dressed in civilian
clothes and long coats also carrying newly-stolen shotguns

Ion and Amara come flying across the parking lot --

ION

tarmac towards them

INT CAYENNE - CONTINUOUS

AMARA

Adams starts the car -- Cetus is almost on them The car

PEELS OUT gaining speed as Cetus’ Swythe SNAPS into a LONG
JAVELIN which he THROWS HARD

BAM The javelin PUNCHES straight through the backseat door
sticking into the front divider -- inches from Amara’s body
EXT PARKING LOT WALMART - CONTINUOUS

BLAM BLAM Dutch fires from the window as the car pulls away
-- Cetus deflects with his SHELL watches them disappear as
he stands still in the empty parking lot

Then Cetus walks over to a nearby car -- SMASHES the window
opens the door and gets in starts hot-wiring the car

WE TRACK AROUND -- four Wolves sit outside the car
CETUS

EXT NEW YORK - VARIOUS

AZRAYL opens his eyes from the spirit-walk trance still in
the wrecked military lab The Signal glows beside him

AZRAYL

-- ORION wakes from his trance huddled next to a dumpster

-- CORVUS walks out of a subway station into a street where
emergency crews battle a fire in a bombed apt building

-- NUBIS starts jogging down a snowy blacked out avenue
filled with worried New Yorkers talking helping each other

-- TRACKING DOWN the avenue ALL THREE are RUNNING now in
parallel

INT CAYENNE DRIVING — NIGHT

They’re all stunned breathing fast as the car speeds away
Ion looks back -- no-one seems to be chasing

Amara is staring in shock at the Swythe-spear inches away
part of it still sticking out of the car Ion takes the
handle in his hand and the spear-ends SNAP back into it

ADAMS
Everyone okay

VAUGHN
He came right to us How can they
do that Who are those guys

Ion glances at Amara next to him Dutch stares at the Swythe

DUTCH
What is that thing

ION
I think they call it a Swythe it’s
all they land with They don’t risk
bringing more advanced tech in case
it’s taken or used against the
Immortals It can form a large but
limited number of tools or short-
range weapons

At this all three Deltas glance back at it interested --
boys and their toys Ion picks up the second one from the
floor Hands one to Dutch

ION (CONTD)
You can have one

DUTCH
How do you work it

ION
Clear your mind then feel what you
want it to form

Dutch concentrates the Swythe suddenly SNAPS out a metal
BASEBALL BAT-shape -- startling Amara -- it hits the roof

VAUGHN
Not in the car dipshit Lemme see
that

DUTCH
Hang on

Vaughn reaches back for it from the passenger seat as Dutch
keeps it away from him

Amara looks at Ion then takes the PHOTO from her pocket and
tries to give it back to him

AMARA
Here

ION
It’s yours Maybe it’1l help you
remember

Amara studies Ion’s face for a moment as he looks outside
Then she peers down at the photo in her hands thinking

ADAMS (0S)
New York City coming up
(Beat)
This is it I hope you know what
you’re doing Ion

A tense SILENCE as they pass under a large highway sign Ion
turns his Swythe handle over in his hands -- determined

ION
Just keep driving

EXT MANHATTAN NYC - NIGHT

The city is in a mess Entirely without electricity the
slushy streets are filled with people grouping to help each

trucks and ambulances try to push through roads gridlocked
with abandoned cars

EXT FIFTH AVENUE NYC - NIGHT

A helicopter ZOOMS overhead Panicky crowds CHATTER about the

of the tunnel Pedestrians stream out traffic jammed inside

RIOT COP 1

faces)

Keep moving up Thank you

Out of the dark tunnel emerge the three Deltas -- side by
side in hoodies and long overcoats concealing their weapons
They glance at each other This is it

Behind them come Ion and Amara Ion takes her hand a show of
determination more than love

AMARA
They’re looking for someone Ion
who are they looking for

They amble forward with the crowd The Deltas get through
the Guards do not look twice at them

RIOT COP 2 hands Riot Cop 1 a printout of AMARA’S FACE
Riot Cop 1 realizes this is them He goes for his gun --

ADAMS (0S)
Drop the weapons NOW

The cops swing round to see Adams Vaughn and Dutch covering
them all -- coats open M4s and shotguns in each hand

A STAND-OFF -- there are more cops but the Deltas have
better positions EVERYONE YELLS pointing their guns--

VAUGHN
Drop your gun No put it down

Ion is anxious -- readies the Swythe handle A cop’s K-9
starts BARKING furiously at something Amara looks over to
see A WOLF sitting in the road near them

AMARA
(pulls him down)
Ton Get down

MUZZLE FLASHES from the top of the walls above a cop’s
head SHATTERS civilians all around are hit Dutch is caught
in the arm BULLETS CRACKING and BLOOD SPATTERING It’s THEM

The gunfire is REAL AND DEAFENING -- ECHOING around as Cops
Deltas and Radicals exchange fire in the confined aréa

Ion grabs a dead cop’s BALLISTIC SHIELD -- he and Amara crawl
to the RIOT VAN and get in start it up as SHOTS pummel it

AMARA (CONTD)
ADAMS

Adams glances back as Ion puts the van into REVERSE -- guns
it backwards up the slope away from the tunnel -- and the
Deltas use it for cover from the Radicals’ fire

SIRENS -- two cop cars pull up behind In reverse Ion RAMS
them kicking the van up onto the cars He pulls Amara out --

ION
Stay low -- come on

The three Deltas are PRO MODERN WARRIORS -- circling and
covering each other and reloading keeping the Radicals back
and putting cops down only in their TACTICAL VESTS

ADAMS
GO Well cover you get her out of
here

The Deltas’ rifles BARK at the distant flashes Ion and Amara
STAY LOW and RUSH away car to car as TRACER BULLETS fly over

Suddenly the Radicals stop firing Adams glances at Dutch as
if to say -- Shit What now

Corvus LEAPS from nowhere -- Adams blocks the Swythe-
sword blow with his rifle falling back HARD

VAUGHN
No you don’t motherfucker

Vaughn leaps at Corvus pulling him off Adams and SLAMMING
him down -- as soon as they hit the floor the DISTANT FIRING
restarts The Radicals know when their own is in the way

Vaughn and Corvus FIGHT --

Ion shuts the door then knocks over the REFRIGERATOR and
HEAVES it against the door to block it

He goes into the BEDROOM -- Amara finds a camping-—lamp out
and turns it on -- Ion checks the BEDROOM WINDOW Then he’s
back in the LIVING-ROOM looks out the FLOOR-TO-CEILING
WINDOWS -- below is an alley on the building’s back side

Next he checks the couch -- a cushy SOFA-BED He GRABS it and
SHOVES IT -- SMASHING it through the windows and PULLING THE

Suddenly Ion steps in and KISSES HER passionately She’s
stunned -- but she doesn’t fight it Not at all

ION (CONTD)

(quiet)

I have loved you on a thousand
Earths and I always will Try to
remember

Then he SHOVES HER BACKWARDS OUT THE WINDOW She SCREAMS
holding onto the sheet -- at the other end he immediately
guides the sheet out the window after her

EXT ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

PARACHUTE slowing her a little but still DROPPING FAST until

peace and light to these
uncivilized savages

ION

We honor you Ion But you hate us
you betray us Our people will live
forever but you are not really
living anymore It’s ridiculous

A flicker of unease behind Ion’s eyes He’s afraid Nubis and
Orion speak as though they are the same entity carrying out
simultaneous conversations

ORION
We will have this Earth There’s
infinite others of course but you
led us to this one

NUBIS
Youre like them now You crave
her you’re addicted to the idea
that your life will be ‘better’ if
you can just find your love again
Cant you see it what is happening
to you

ION
This Earth is close I can show
them the way with more time

NUBIS
Past and future are illusions of
your mind Ion There’s only this

ORION
It’s much easier to kill them
These people are us after all as
we used to be barbarian and foul
Killing them is no different from -
trimming your own cracked
fingernails Is that murder

ION
Stop it Spreading terror to
influence the Immortals’ decision
is wrong

Orion smiles and glances at Nubis Ion stares at them
uncertain -- like he’s left out of a huge in-joke

ORION
You really don’t see it do you I
suppose it doesn’t matter We pity
you Ion We pity your anguish

SNAP His Swythe melts into a curved scimitar -- Nubis also
SNAPS out a blade They start towards Ion immediately --

Ion FIGHTS like a hurricane against them -- their Swythes
WARPING and CHANGING FORMS mid-swing becoming AXES SWORDS
STAFFS MACES CHAINS --

They SLAM each other into the walls BLADES SLICING through
furniture HITTING with ELBOWS HANDS and FEET -- Ion is an
amazing warrior but the Radicals seem moreprofessional

Ion loses balances and Orion KICKS HIM out the door onto the
top floor landing An OLD MAN comes out of another
apartment sees Ion on the floor STRUGGLING TO BREATHE

OLD MAN
Hey what’s going on out here

ION
Get away

But Orion approaches and GRABS Ion in a PAINFUL HEADLOCK
DRAGGING him toward the Old Man and his apartment

OLD MAN
Stop that Let him go This is my
apartment

Ion watches helplessly as Nubis walks past them and STABS THE
OLD MAN IN THE CHEST He falls to the floor and Orion PINS
ION DOWN next to his dying body

ORION

Look at him LOOK AT HIM What do
you think he’s feeling His whole
being is realizing right now that
it was all absurd Everything he
bought collected owned wanted
and worried about all this time was
meaningless But is he sad No
Hes feeling Life now Seeing the
Truth and it’s so beautiful

Ion STRUGGLES WILDLY but Orion holds on choking him

Death into a cave where he rolled
a stone across the entrance
trapping her inside so that none

on hershe was gone

Ion glances across the fire pit -- Alice is smiling at him

Then Ion sees that Orion is now holding his LEATHER-PENDANT
looking at it with curiosity

ORION (CONTD)
Strange trinket to carry

Ion suddenly attacks RAMMING him into a wall

Adams and Dutch hurry in through the dark department store
with Amara in tow They start climbing the still escalators

It’s EERILY SILENT inside the echoing space is creepy as
clothes racks and mannequins create shadows in the dark

AMARA
What are we doing here We’re not
being followed -- we have to go
back and help him

ADAMS
We’re going to the roof help is
coming

AMARA
What No --

She halts breaking away from them frustrated glaring

AMARA (CONTD)

Who’s coming The whole damn army

possibly help

Dutch watches quietly but he seems to feel for Amara’s case
ADAMS
We called in backup they’ll pick
us up and--

AMARA

Adams looks at her then trying to comfort her he takes her
arm in his hand But she snaps it away--

Adams is discouraged and embarrassed but holds it together

ADAMS
Look They know where he’s going

CRASH The sound of a window SMASHING echoes up from the
floor below Someone breaking in They quickly fall silent

ADAMS (CONTD)

pistol from the back of his pants and hands it to her

The three of them quietly back away into the store

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Ion arrives outside the high-rise office building with the
Lab hidden inside NYPD and FBI have cordoned off the whole
block LIGHTS FLASHING Ion glances up -- sees the HOLE left
by Azryal’s crash-pod in the side of the building

Glimpses of SNIPERS in windows of buildings opposite Ion
takes a DEEP BREATH shivering in the cold without his
jacket He MOVES FAST VAULTING from a van OVER the cordon
DUCKING and ROLLING between cop cars timing his movements
with near-impossible perfection as cops all around him turn
or glance the other way for a second just missing him

At an open trunk Ion grabs a DUFFEL BAG A PISTOL and A
LIGHT In moments Ion reaches an entrance and slips inside
INT TOP FLOOR DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT

QUIET FOOTSTEPS coming up the still escalator Orion stops at
the top a shadow in the gloom looking listening

Adams taps Amara to say -- this way The three of them SLOWLY
creep backwards among racks of long coats and pants

Orion seems like he has a sixth sense moving towards them

Suddenly Amara FREEZES and holds them still between a dense
thicket of clothes racks NUBIS also hooded walks RIGHT
PAST them from the other direction -- he was behind them the
whole time but miraculously missed them

Nubis pauses only six feet away looks around As he turns
away they make a move -- keeping low between the racks

INT STAIRWELL OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Ion moves quietly up the metal-grating fire stairwell

pulls Dutch down but his gun CLINKS on the floor

ORION -- instantly turns towards the sound They FREEZE
Amara can see Orion in between the clothes rackshe’s just
STANDING STILL why

NUBIS -- comes quickly around a corner Orion watches as he
turns to where the sound wasbut there’s NOTHING THERE

Nubis glances across at Orion Cetus joins them from across
the floor They’re suspicious -- they know she’s there
somewhere All three move synchronized as if one entity

INT TOP FLOOR OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Ion grips the Swythe tight walking through the dark office
space dimly lit by SWAT spotlights outside far below

He turns a corner and sees AZRAYL dead still in the middle of
an office the glowing Signal at his feet Only his eyes move
-- tracking with Ion Azrayl is menacingly calm

ION
(recognizing him)
It’s you

AZRAYL
It is I never know if you’ll
remember me or not what with
yourproblems How long since you
crashed on this Earth Ten years A
thousand

ION
I need to talk to them when they
come I need more time here

AZRAYL
Youre probably one of the single
oldest bodies in all of the
Immortal Earths did you know that
The last thing you need is more

time
ION
Why are you doing this to me
AZRAYL
Because it is my duty -- something
you’ve forgotten Yours is to be
the Scout
ION

I won’t I don’t do it anymore
A wry smile creeps across Azrayl’s face

AZRAYL
You don’t have any choice Ion

Ion is growing more and more anxious again confused
ION
Give me the Signal

AZRAYL
Do you remember the last time you
saw me

ION
You killed her In the forest

AZRAYL

The forest
(Beat thinks about it)

Your memory really is random isn’t
it I remember the forest But that
wasn’t the last time Weve met
plenty of times in between that
version of Earth

ION
What does it matter I remember
what I need to

AZRAYL
Do you ever remember a time when
you did your mission the way you’re
supposed to Did you ever actually
stay in orbit and send the signal
for us

Ion stares at Azrayl trying to guess his meaning

ION
Stop it
AZRAYL
(aggressive)

Stop what What do you want Ion
You will not grow old it’s not how
we do it But she will die one way
or another And what then

ION
Give me The Signal I will kill you
if I have to

AZRAYL
There are four assault teams
converging on our position My men
have almost found the girl and the

LIGHT - a HAIL OF BULLETS IGNITES around them TWO SWAT
TEAMS start shooting from the far ends of the office

Azrayl drops backwards Ion dives behind a desk grabs The
Signal and zips it inside his duffel He glances across at
Azrayl who stares at him serenely completely calm Ion HEARS
HIS VOICE IN HIS HEAD

AZRAYL (V0)
‘Without fear of death you can
attempt anything

Just then the windows SHATTER and ANOTHER SWAT TEAM ropes in
from above landing RIGHT NEXT TO THEM

Azrayl SNAPS out a LARGE CURVED BLADE and slices two SWATs
then DIVES OUT THE WINDOW -- grabs a rappel rope and starts
CLIMBING IT FAST

Ion SHOOTS two SWATs next to him in their vests putting them
down momentarily -- hooks the bag over his back and LEAPS OUT
INTO THE AIR -- grasping for a rope HIGH ABOVE THE CITY

INT DEPARTMENT STORE - SAME TIME
Amara runs for her life down the escalator stairs

Above Orion overpowers Dutch as Adams USES UP HIS RIFLE AMMO
keeping Cetus and Nubis at a distance

Dutch falls next to Orion’s Swythe handle GRABS IT -- SNAPS
out a baseball bat and SMACKS ORION in the face

DUTCH
(to Adams)
GO Help Amara
(Adams hesitates)
FUCKING GO

Adams sprints away downstairs with Nubis and Cetus fast on
his tail Dutch turns back to Orion who touches the BLOOD
running down his face ANGRY Dutch stares him in the eyes

DUTCH (CONTD)
My name is Francis Dutch I was
born in this city And I’m gonna
fuckin’ kill you

Orion FLIES at Dutch flattening him to the floor getting
control of the Swythe which SNAPS into a MACHETE -- and he
RAMS it into Dutch’s chest

SNICKT But Dutch pulls his own COMMANDO KNIFE from his belt
and THRUSTS IT INTO ORION’S NECK They glance at each other
both knowing they’re dead Neither particularly caring

DUTCH (CONTD)
This ain’t over between you and me

Orion SMILES euphorically as his life drains away

EXT ROOF OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Ion climbs fast up the swinging rope to the roof above as
high-calibre sniper rounds PUNCH into the walls around him
In the bg -- MUZZLE FLASHES from SWAT SNIPERS

Ion rolls onto the roof taking cover behind the edge --
Azrayl is there two officers dead beside him Azrayl quickly
grabs a wound-up length of rope looks at Ion then up

AZRAYL
There’s always a way out you just
have to be unafraid to die for it

Ion LUNGES AT HIM hatefully pinning him down but -- ZOOM A
SWAT chopper ROARS over them SHOOTING They roll away as the
concrete SPLINTERS UP beneath them They’re in trouble

INT DEPARTMENT STORE -— NIGHT
Adams races down the escalator to the first floor when --
THWACK A Swythe-javelin flies into his back He GROANS

falling hard into the linoleum floor

Nubis and Cetus reach him when suddenly Amara bursts out from
HIDING NEARBY and starts SHOOTING FAST--

AMARA
(furious screams)
JUST DIE
--she hits Nubis in the head and he falls -- but Cetus SHELL-
SPINS and Amara immediately grabs Adams dragging him -
backwards across the floor while he weakly takes pot shots at
Cetus with his pistol -- keeping him ‘in his shell’
Amara pulls the spear out of Adams and helps him limp to an
exit door
EXT STREETS OF NEW YORK - CONTINUOUS

They hobble out quickly and collapse together arm in arm
aiming their weapons at the doorbreathing hard Exhausted

Amara glances up at the sky -- dark clouds have rolled in
Lightning FLICKERS BRILLIANTLY WEIRDLY inside them

Weak and bleeding Adams takes out the Sat-phone

EXT ROOF OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

ANGLE ON ION’S SWYTHE -- ONE END FORMS A CARABINER THE
OTHER MELTS OUT INTO A GRAPPLING HOOK THEN RETRACTS AGAIN

Ion ties an end of rope through the carabiner end -- TIGHT
Hes pinned down between AC UNITS and large pipes The
chopper ROARS overhead taking POTSHOTS at Azrayl nearby

Ion wraps the other end of the rope around his torso tying
it off and looping the slack over his shoulders

AZRAYL (0S)
(shouts)
Ton

Ion glances quickly across -- we see Azrayl has done the same
thing with his Swythe and rope Azrayl nods to the strange
sky

AZRAYL (CONTD)
--they’re here

Ion rushes him -- grabs Azrayl as the SWAT teams emerge from
the fire-doors to the roof Bullets SMACK all around them as
they grapple right at the edge -- dizzingly high above NYC

Azrayl smiles and PULLS THEM BOTH OVER THE EDGE

We FREE-FALL FAST with Ion as the two split COLD WIND
WHISTLING GLASS WINDOWS RUSHING PAST INCHES AWAY --

Ion presses the end of his Swythe to the glass andSNAP
The GRAPPLING HOOK punches out through the windows -- HOOKING
FAST as Ion falls and BANG He jarringly SLAMS TO A HALT
hanging on the end of the rope still 40 stories up

Further down AZRAYL has done the same Ion GROANS IN PAIN

THWACK THWACK Sniper bullets smack into the windows near
him -- oh shit He looks up to the Swythe concentrates

ANGLE ON THE SWYTHE -- ITS GRAPPLE HOOK RETRACTS AGAIN

Ion drops into another VERTIGO-INDUCING FALL -- this time he
has to QUICKLY PULL IN THE ROPE to grab the Swythe handle

The ground’s coming up fast He deploys the grapple hook
again -- ANOTHER PAINFUL JARRING HALT -- this time only just
above the ground not far from all the Police

Azrayl drops CATLIKE from his rope to the ground sprinting
away into the city Ion concentrates the Swythe-hook
retracts and he drops to the ground

Ion picks up the Swythe-handle and starts to get up
whenBAM SWAT Officers SLAM him into the ground from
behind -- dozens more COPS racing over with guns drawn

He is caught

EXT STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT
Adams sits collapsed in Amara’s lap He drops the Sat-phone
ADAMS
(feeble)
Help’s coming Any second

Amara glances down at him while she still aims at the exit
door Amara nudges Adams but his head lolls

AMARA
Adams Come on please don’t -- you
don’t have to do this for me

Adams

But he’s gone Tears in her eyes Amara stands up glancing
down at the body of the soldier who died for her The wind
blows cold Dark buildings rise beside her She is ALONE

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Ion is handcuffed behind his back being dragged between the
cop cars towards an NYPD MOBILE HOLDING TRUCK ahead He is
DISTRAUGHT struggling in frustration

ION
NO You don’t understand You have
to let me go They’re going to kill
her I have to go they will be
here any minute LET ME G--

A SWAT OFFICER hits him HARD

SWAT OFFICER
Shut up

ION
I have to talk to them for you
Youre all going to die if you
don’t let me go

They open the doors to the TRUCK and pull him inside

INT MOBILE HOLDING TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

They throw Ion inside one of the holding cells

Ion falls to his knees inside almost hysterical with
anxiety As the officers step outside again Ion tries to
calm himself His breathing slows He closes his eyes

EXT FOREST WORLD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Alice is setting up tents with the rest of her traveler
people She laughs with an old woman about something

Native Ion stares at her from a slight distance He looks
down -- in his hand is a FADED TORN VERSION of the PHOTO

He looks up at her again -- she is looking at him curiously
She smiles at him nervously but with an obvious flicker of
attraction

EXT STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT

Amara glances up and down the quiet street in the dark city
helpless

Suddenly she turns around to see THE DEER

It stands quietly in the middle of the road looking at her
with its deep calm eyes as SOUNDLESS LIGHTNING flickers in
the clouds above

The sight of it again a presence consistent throughout her
life almost makes her break down completely --

AMARA
(emotional)
--Ion

She walks to it but it steps backwards waiting She’s
supposed to follow -- she starts jogging after it as-—-

BAM Now the door flies open and Cetus RUNS at her fast down
the street with his swythe-sword ready--

BLAM BLAM Amara shoots back at him but the bullets go wide
-- she turns and RUNS FOR IT

EXT POLICE CORDON OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

TWO LARGE MILITARY HELICOPTERS ROAR overhead flying low in
between the buildings They’re flanked by SPECIAL FORCES
“LITTLE BIRD” CHOPPERS -- ELITE SOLDIERS standing out on the
side-rails As some circle one of the large helicopters
lands in the middle of the street

The FBI COMMANDER and NYPD turn in amazement as the doors
open and SOLDIERS jump out armed to the teeth

Then comes COLONEL LAUER in fatigues a serious no-
bullshit operator And finallyDR RIVERS climbs out
carefully his arm in a sling and face bandaged

FBI COMMANDER
What is this What’s going on

COLONEL LAUER
I’m Colonel Lauer You have someone
in custody

FBI COMMANDER
This is an FBI operation we
believe terrorist cells could--

COLONEL LAUER
--We’re authorized under Order 3-
14 we’re in charge
(hands him a document)
Where is he

NYPD OFFICER
(dumbstruck)
He’s in the truck

Colonel Lauer immediately strides away towards the truck
flanked by his men -- Dr Rivers limping behind Lauer’s
ASSISTANT stays with the FBI

LAUER’S ASSISTANT
We want the building emptied and
everyone involved in your operation
assembled for a debrief Now No
exceptions

The FBI Commander turns to his agents flabbergasted

IE MOBILE HOLDING TRUCK - NIGHT

Ion’s eyes snap open and he GASPS -- he looks up to see
Colonel Lauer and Dr Rivers standing in front of him with
the cell door open

ION
Chris
DR RIVERS
(smiles)

Hi Ion

Ion stands up and hugs him but pulls away anxiously runs
past them out of the truck--

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
Ion wait

ION
--Amara’s in trouble

COLONEL LAUER
Just tell us where
EXT POLICE CORDON OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
But Ion doesn’t have time -- he sprints past soldiers and
cops searching -- there He jumps onto a parked POLICE
MOTORCYCLE Starts it up -- ROARS OFF
NEAR THE TRUCK -- Colonel Lauer barks into his radio

COLONEL LAUER
Two birds stay on that bike

A couple Little Bird choppers zoom after Ion

Dr Rivers glances up at the sky Weird black clouds
lightning flickering

EXT MIDTOWN MANHATTAN -— NIGHT

Amara SPRINTS away from Cetus -- fighting past New Yorkers in
the streets She looks for the Deer but he’s gone

EXT STREETS OF NEW YORK - SAME TIME

Ion guns the motorcycle fast shifting between the parked
cars and snowbanks and people

EXT MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS

Amara is tiring slowing down She glances back as Cetus
SNAPS his Swythe into a spear prepares to throw it--

BAM A BLUR OF METAL slides across the tarmac CUTTING his
legs out --

Ion dropped the bike at speed rolling away as it SLAMMED
into Cetus Ion doesn’t hesitate -- runs to his body where
Cetus’ legs are CRACKED and BROKEN Ion looks at him

CETUS
Do you remember it Death is --
it’s like falling falling from a
great height and when you reach
the bottomyou wake up

Ion picks up the Swythe-spear as civilians and Amara watch--
ION
See you in your next life Not
mine

Ion kills him He turns back to Amara on her knees in the
street breathing hard exhausted He crouches next to her

POV AMARA SHE LOOKS UP BUT HER VIEW IS DIFFERENT-—

EXT FOREST WORLD - DAY (AMARA FLASHBACK)
Native Ion helps Alice up over a boulder behind them are her
whole group of travelers Ahead of Ion is his friend Chua
They are leading the travelers through the forest
ION (SUBTITLE)
(smiling)
Come on Were almost there
BACK TO SCENE
Amara stares at Ion IN A NEW LIGHT She knows She remembers

A Little Bird chopper touches down behind them

EXT POLICE CORDON OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

The helicopter lands outside the Lab-building where the army
have now CORDONED off the entire block They’ve set-up
FLOODLIGHTS on mobile generators Some military scientists
are also setting up other equipment

A TRIO of FIGHTER JETS ZOOM overhead arching around the
city

Ion and Amara disembark staying close to each other

Colonel Lauer and Dr Rivers rush over to them and Ion walks
and talks with them --

ION
Have you got the Signal

DR RIVERS
It’s right over here

COLONEL LAUER
Whoever they are they’re right on
our doorstep now NASA’s got a
massive number of unknown objects
just outside our orbit Ion youve
got to help us now -- what can they
do What can we hit them with

ION
They won’t come within your range
You will never see their faces

Lightning cracks across the swirling sky illuminating thick
black clouds overhead

COLONEL LAUER
(suddenly scared)
What I thought this was an
invasion

ION
First they are coming to talk

DR RIVERS
Talk

ION
Yes And to judge you

COLONEL LAUER
Who are they Who are these people

ION
People Only people like you or
me There is nothing else
(Beat)
But they will open your eyes

As if on cue noiseless LIGHTNING STREAKS again across the
sky and the floodlights and flashlights CUT OUT DARKNESS

The only light seems to come from The Signal sitting on the
ground in the middle of the street - its glow pulsing bright

EXT MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Azrayl jogs through the streets hurrying past people who
have all stopped peering up at the sky

He stops at a trash dumpster and fishes out a duffel bag
looks inside It is one LAST HOMEMADE BOMB He hurries off
towards the cordoned area

EXT POLICE CORDON OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
Ion looks at Amara -- she is still holding his hand

ION
Are you okay

AMARA
(smiles)
Stop asking me that

He nods smiling but a little sad He’s worried He walks
forward to The Signal and kneels in front of it

DR RIVERS (0S)
You knew about the helicopter back
on the base You took her out
because you knew what would happen

Ion glances up at his old friend who seems even older still

ION
I don’t know how I just know
(Beat)
I’m glad you’re here

DR RIVERS
--I know

Ion looks back at The Signal and closes his eyes

EXT FOREST WORLD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Imagine a highway town abandoned for millennia that dense
forest has completely consumed Giant sequoias grow up where
roads once ran Trees and foliage and earth grow beautifully
out of empty shells of buildings

Native Ion and Chua walk through this scene leading the
travelers behind them BIRDS CALL the forest alive with
sound

Alice walks up next to Ion She speaks cheerfully flirting

ALICE (SUBTITLE)
Its lucky you found us isnt it

He stares back -- falling headlong for this girl She
stumbles and he doubles back CROUCHING DOWN TO HELP HER UP

BACK TO

EXT POLICE CORDON OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

BOOM A HUGE THUNDERCLAP RUMBLES LONG OVERHEAD The clouds
seem to swirl with flickering lights lightning inside them
illuminating a shifting spectrum

Everyone is SILENCED Everyone looks up from the dark city

Something falls from the clouds fluttering like a feather
high above -- only a speck It is small and white -- as it
gets lower they can see that it is a bird A WHITE DOVE

It flaps quietly downwards And as it reaches the level of
the tall buildings -- suddenly the lights inside SURGE WHITE-
HOT Electronic billboards FLARE WHITE - every light source
burns and fades as the Dove moves downwards past them

The Dove floats down and lands on top of The Signal box which
FLARES BRIGHT casting a stary light-effect across the road

The Dove flaps its wings and looks around again with a kind
of HUMAN INTELLIGENCE Everyone stares at it -- in confusion
in awe Some soldiers cross themselves Amara is amazed

AMARA
Is it
(to Dr Rivers)
Can you

DR RIVERS
Yes I can see it

The Dove faces Ion eyeing him alone as he kneels in front of
it A long moment of SILENCE then

Ion SPEAKS QUIETLY -- but it is in the FOREST WORLD LANGUAGE
The others do not understand -- Colonel Lauer steps closer
listening intently but in utter confusion Ion continues

COLONEL LAUER
What language is that What is he
saying

DR RIVERS
I dont know

But Amara is fixed on Ion slowly she kneels down near The
Signal too Can she somehow understand what he is saying

Ion finishes talking A moment’s pause and then he stands up
and turns to Colonel Lauer The Dove watches them

ION
He says that--

COLONEL LAUER
--He It’s a bird

Ion glances at Amara quickly Then back to Lauer

ION

I’ve visited with many people on
Many Earths and I’ve seen
societies like yours many times
You have always claimed to know
many things but you are ignorant
even of the capabilities of your
own mind and spirit The People
Immortal would not risk a physical
encounter with such an obviously
fearful and violent civilization
It is a form of travel or etheric
projection -- Dr Rivers might have
told you about my own journeys
while I’ve been a guest here

(Beat)
He says the rest of their people
will come now in a similar
fashion They ask you to warn your
troops -- do not be alarmed

COLONEL LAUER
What is this Are we being invaded
or not Can we do anything

ION
I will talk to them

Ion looks up at the sky - and then they see it Silhouetted
by the flickering lightning high above INUMBERABLE BIRDS

They are STARLINGS -- flocking as they do in reality ina
vast swarm -- circling and grouping in a MESMERIZING
STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL movement turns undulations and ripples
flow through the multitude of birds not unlike in a school of
fish below the ocean

EXT STREETS OF NEW YORK - SAME TIME

Soldiers and civilians across the city stare at the sky --
completely awestruck by one of the most arresting sights in
nature here amplified to a truly biblical scale

EXT SKY ABOVE NEW YORK - SAME TIME

HIGH AND WIDE we see the massive size of the flock that
seems to melt down from the dark flickering clouds that hang
up above the city The starlings circle and spin as the
FAINTEST GLOW of dawn begins to brighten the sky

Some of them descend into the actual city --

EXT POLICE CORDON OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Dr Rivers and the others stare as the ‘ribbons’ flow off of
the main flock -- the birds arching and zooming down between
Manhattan’s skyscrapers

DR RIVERS
(to himself)
Theyre starlings

A soldier next to Rivers glances at him then back up in awe

While the main swarm continues its hypnotic movement above
still thousands of birds alight on every window sill rooftop
and lamppost Peering down at every person

Ion once again kneels before The Signal -- the Dove glancing
at him and peering at Amara too

ION (SUBTITLE)
(quiet)
I am Ion I am your Scout

The Immortals’ voice is heard in his head a sound of many
voices at once whispering together

THE IMMORTALS (VO) (SUBTITLE)
You sabotage your mission Scout

ION (SUBTITLE)
Yes But I will not apologize

THE IMMORTALS (VO) (SUBTITLE)
Your cause is self-serving

ION (SUBTITLE)
She was taken from me

THE IMMORTALS (VO) (SUBTITLE)
She is her own person She does not
belong to you -- what happened
happened

ION (SUBTITLE)
(angry)
No -- dont cheapen it dont
pretend that it doesnt exist I
love her

THE IMMORTALS (VO) (SUBTITLE)
Are you sure

Ion looks at Amara beat up clothes filthy still beautiful

ION (SUBTITLE)
She is all I have

The Dove’s beady eyes seems to inspect Amara as she stares
at it in amazement

THE IMMORTALS (VO) (SUBTITLE)
This is not about you Ion Look
around this world is stricken with
fear and destruction We are
spreading enlightenment and eternal
life to the infinite Earths and you
are the crucial part We honor you--

ION (SUBTITLE)
--Do not lecture me about
enlightenment

Suddenly Ion stands up anxious and furious -- SPEAKING
LOUDLY to all of them at once

ION (CONT’D)
(in English)

You You people would have me
single out those Earths that do not
have our technology or knowledge --
you come down here anonymous and
godlike to massage your own egos
That is self-serving You sow fear
and awe and smirk behind your backs
at their perceived barbarism while
you would murder and steal from
them all in the name of
enlightenment I AM HERE

(MORE )

ION (CONTD)
I have tasted their air I have
bled and learned and laughed with
the people of every Earth that I
have landed on You peer down at
them with pretentious curiosity
ready to wipe them out ina
heartbeat for their young Earth

(Beat sneering)

I am the Scout for you the
“Kingdom of the Heavens” In all
the superverse there is only one
Ion That is why I am what I am
why I must do this task And I say
that it is you who are corrupt For
all time I have travelled for you
but you would send killers ahead of
you to snuff out any glimmer of my
own happiness

At this the birds seem uneasy shifting on their perches
while above -- the swarm turns faster more dynamic

ION (SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
Leave this Earth You cannot impose
your divinity from without these
people deserve to live and find it
for themselves

(Beat)

Please give me one mortal
lifetime Let me live one lifetime
here with her and I will Scout
again I will find you new Earths
for another eternity I promise

One by one gradually so that it is barely perceptible -- the
starlings begin disappearing fading into the clouds above
and the shadows below

ION (CONTD)
(shouts)
What say you
(subtitle)
What is your decision

Ion spins around glaring at them with mad anxiety as they
disappear Finally he wheels on The Dove - furious

ION (CONTD)
Speak to me

But the Dove flaps its wings and takes off -- the light in
The Signal dies SWIRLING CELESTIAL LIGHTNING FLICKERS in
the clouds above

Everyone looks up as the WHITE DOVE flies upwards
Colonel Lauer turns in expectation -- Ion cannot believe it

ION (CONTD)
(shocked relieved)
I think they’re leaving

A hand on his shoulder -- it is Amara She takes his hand --
he stands up and looks at her

AMARA
They spoke to me in my head

ION
What What did they say t

She seems sad but she also looks at him like she finally
understands it all

AMARA
I do remember I don’t know how
just flashes like a fading dream
but I remember you

Ton looks at her hardly believing it -- and SHE KISSES HIM

AMARA (CONTD)
(whisper close to him)
They told me what’s going to
happen

BOOM A large bomb EXPLOSION ROCKS one of the buildings next
to them from a few stories up -- GLASS AND DEBRIS AND ASH
BURST everywhere Some soldiers are blown away Others start
running to help SCREAMS people fleeing everywhere in a
panic Colonel Lauer goes into war-mode SCREAMING orders
into his radio thinking they are attacked

Ion sees everything as if in slow-motion Fear grips him

ION
Noplease

But he cannot stop what is coming as we realize we have seen
this scene before

EXT CITY STREET —- CONTINUOUS

Tall dark buildings -- no power One ON FIRE CRUMBLING

PEOPLE scatter in panic TRASH spins up in a HOWLING WIND
BODIES lie in the wet gutter lined with winter slush

A Man stands eyes searching the chaos -- he is sharp
soulful but anxious He looks up -- swirling celestial
lights FLICKER behind the low clouds This is ION WE TRACK around as he turns - A WOMAN is standing next to
him also gazing around in awe This is Amara Ion stares at
her strangely her hair whipping in the wind

Suddenly Ion notices a MAN - AZRAYL -- only a shadowed
silhouette in the gloomy street He raises a GUN at them

Ion’s eyes fill with ABSOLUTE FEAR as he glances at the Woman
next to him Ion raises his hand like a feeble shieldBLAM

SMASH CUT TO

EXT WATERFALL POOL FOREST WORLD - MORNING (FLASHBACK)

Native Ion and Chua BURST above the surface of the waterfall
pool GASPING for air out of breath Ion is grinning

Chua splashes Ion with mock disappointment but then they
both sense something turning around to see --

A LARGE BAND OF TRAVELERS staring at them People stand and
sit on the bank with their belongings WOMEN AND CHILDREN
were bathing in the shallow water now watching in SILENCE

Ion and Chua swim towards them until they can stand
Suspicious but not hostile Chua calls out

CHUA (SUBTITLE)
Who are you

A female voice ANSWERS in the same language (not translated)
It is ALICE She stands waist-deep naked and covering her
breasts but unashamed

Ion sees her -- staring like he has seen a ghost It is her
He has finally found her And he is instantly smitten again

She SPEAKS gesturing towards her group Chua nods and
REPLIES -- okay She nods back For an awkward moment they
are all SILENT the WATERFALL FALLING Then Alice gestures
asking them to turn around so that she can dress

Ion still entranced by her turns and closes his eyes

MATCH CUT TO

EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

Ion’s eyes open he’s lying on his back in the road He
winces -- a deep slice in his arm He looks over to his left--

Amara is lying next to him breath shallow eyes staring The
wind howls people run in panic FLAMING DEBRIS BURNS nearby

Ion pulls himself over to her anxious manic to see -- she
is shot in the chest -- the same spot above her left breast
Tears run down his cheeks as he holds her in his arms

ION
No noAmara not again

She looks at him struggling to breathe

AMARA
Was it worth it To see me

ION
Always

He kisses her on the lips pulls back She smiles

AMARA
Find me Find me again

And like that she is gone He stares at her empty body in
shock knowing that he has lost her again

FOOTSTEPS NEARBY -- Azrayl walks over to Ion

AZRAYL
You are the Scout that they will
believe forever But you have
offended them and they will not
forgive forever This Earth is now
yours they will not touch it But
your lesson must be to forget her

Ion looks up at him but there is nothing he can say now
AZRAYL (CONTD)
You’re in love with a mortal soul
She is your curse This is your
punishment My work here is done
Azrayl raises the gun again -- but puts it to his own head

AZRAYL (CONTD)
See you in another life Ion

BLAM Azrayl shoots himself

Ion sits in shock Suddenly he notices the PHOTO in Amara’s
hand as the wind catches it and it tumbles into the flaming
debris nearby -- BURNING UP

Ion’s soul is crushed He barely registers the frenzied
activity of the army and people around him fire-fighting

Dr Rivers approaches kneels down beside Ion and simply
wraps his arms around him hugging him The normal power
suddenly comes back on slowly lighting up the city

The sky is clearing too as the sun’s first light shows

CLOSE ON ION AND DR RIVERS KNEELED TOGETHER IN CHAOS

DR RIVERS
Go
(shaking him gently)
Ion Go get out of here now before
they take you into custody again
Just get away You have to

Ion looks at him his old and only friend Ion comes back to
life slightly but then takes the LEATHER-DIAMOND PENDANT
from his neck

ION
No They don’t know what I can do
Here do me one favor
(gives it to him)
Take this
(Rivers is confused)
‘You were right it’s not
decoration It’s manufactured --
data storage

DR RIVERS
I don’t understand

ION
(exhausted upset)

Binary code it works off simple
binary The diamond it’s a crystal
of Carbon-12 and Carbon-13 atoms
they used 12 for the zero and 13
for the one in binary It’s my
backup in case they left me I had
it made it once on another Earth --
I don’t remember when They don’t
know I have it

(MORE)

ION (CONTD)
That diamond stores more data than
every computer on your Earth -- it

has the instructions to rebuild my
ship It has everything Please
take it Follow it exactly Then
find me

Dr Rivers takes the pendant hardly believing it

ION (CONT’D)
This Earth will prosper with the
knowledge It will take a long
time I will wait

Dr Rivers looks at his broken friend with pity

DR RIVERS
I once heard a saying one must pay
dearly for immortality one has to
die several times while one is
still alive I do not envy you

Dr Rivers glances back at Colonel Lauer BARKING ORDERS He
picks Ion up

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
You told me that nothing ever
dies Somewhere Ion she is alive
Ion nods trying to pull himself together

ION
Thank you for being my friend

DR RIVERS
Maybe I’11 see you again

Ion smiles grimly Then he starts to jog away

DR RIVERS (CONTD)
Wait

Ion glances back
DR RIVERS (CONTD)
When the ship is done -- how will
they find you

ION
Look everywhere and keep looking

Ion turns and runs as army helicopters ROAR overhead and fire
trucks HOSE DOWN the bombed building

EXT MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - CONTINUOUS

Ton runs FASTER AND FASTER through the streets of New York --
his BREATHING BECOMING STRONGER AND STRONGER until we

MATCH CUT TO

EXT FOREST WORLD - DAWN

Bare feet running -- a BLUR OF MOVEMENT as Native Ion and a
friend Chua SPRINT through the undergrowth -- a FOOT RACE
Though physically the same age Ion seems YOUNGER IN SPIRIT
carefree almost childlike

ION (V0) (SUBTITLE)

(voice is fatherly

telling it to Young

Howahkan )
but his punishment was not
death No no death is nothing
Death is easy For Sheefus the
spirits had something else in mind

They fly through the LUSH BEAUTIFUL FOREST dangerously fast
fearlessly leaping over sharp boulders and logs

ION (VO) (SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
He was condemned forever and his
punishment was to heave a rock all
the way up the Great Mountain
whose slopes are the same but
different each time you look at
them

Chua laughs and SHOVES Ion in mid-air -- unfazed and
grinning Ion gracefully kicks off atree correcting himself
and landing on his feet

ION (VO) (SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
And whenever he reached the top
the boulder would slip from his
grasp and it would fall tumbling
away from him all the way down

Ion gains an advantage pushing faster when suddenly the
foliage disappears and they LEAP STRAIGHT OUT OVER A CLIFF--

Ion spins in the air gloating at Chua just behind as HE
FALLS 100 FEET down to a DEEP WATERFALL POOL below winning

SMASH CUT TO

INT TEMPLE - DAY

Eyes snap open They scan around taking in the room as if
for the first time Ion seems the same age but now his hair
is LONG AND FILTHY with a YEARS-OLD BEARD

ION (VO) (SUBTITLE)
The spirits thought that their
torture of him would be crushing
But Sheefus was no ordinary man
and he defied the spirits once
again

He sits on a DUSTY STONE FLOOR in a SIMPLE TEMPLE thin
shafts of sunlight breaching the dark small birds FLUTTER in
the rafters

ION (V0) (SUBTITLE) (CONTD)
For he accepted his fate he did
not hope or want for anything more
than he had

OTHER MONKS of all ages meditate or quietly shuffle past

ION (VO) (SUBTITLE) (CONT Dy
So as Sheefus reached the bottom
