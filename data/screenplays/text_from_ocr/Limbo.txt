INT EXT SALMON LADDER - DAY

OPENING CREDITS play over SLOW-MOTION footage of SALMON beat
to hell by their long journey struggling mightily to throw
their bodies up the steps of an INDUSTRIAL SALMON LADDER
SPAWNERS struggle rest and in some cases die on every
side We SUPERIMPOSE the TITLE-

LIMBO
We hear a VOICE intoning a poetic travelogue

ALBRIGHT (V0)
Welcome to Americas Last Frontier

INT EXT VARIOUS SHOTS 2

As the rap continues we CROSS-CUT between travelogue-style
shots of an enormous TOUR BOAT discharging its PASSENGERS
into the dockside shopping area of Port Henry Alaska and
SALMON being sorted cleaned gutted processed and canned by
WORKERS in a large CANNERY-

ALBRIGHT (V0O)

Where the final lumbering remnants
of the Ice Age the massive and awe-
inspiring glaciers calve cathedral-
sized icebergs into the sea Where
Natures bounty unfolds in a panoply
of flora and fauna the like which is
seen nowhere else on the planet

Prom the ocean depths plumbed by
ageless cetaceans to azure skies
where the mighty eagle soars this
land abounds with creatures great and
small strange and majestic It is

a land steeped in tradition its
mists redolent of the hardy souls of
men who have gone to sea- Tlingit and
Haida Inuit and Aleut Russian and
Norwegian- their languages and deeds
lingering on in the names of our
countless islands and passageways

A land that for centuries has lifted
its siren call to the bold and
adventurous to men and women willing
to risk their lives for the promise
of untold fortune be it from fur or
fin from the Heaven-pointing spires
of old-growth spruce or from the
buried treasures of yellow gold or
black energy-rich petroleum

The voice CROSS FADES with ANOTHER rougher more ironic VOICE-

‘ALBRIGHT AND HARM
A land visited each year by the
relentless and mysterious salmon as
it completes its great cycle of life
each river and stream welcoming home
the king and sockeye-

INT CANNERY - SLIMING TABLE 3

HARMON HARM KING a foreman at the plant stands behind
several MEN and WOMEN who are cleaning gurry off saimon and
sliding them on toward the next step in the process Only
one of them RICKY is really listening to his oration-

HARM
-coho and dog the pink or humpback
that is smashed into cans and quick-
cooked to give the colorful local
folk something to do other than play
cards and scratch their nuts all day
A land where that nice old lady from
Fort Lauderdale who had the stroke
three cabins down was probably parked
next to the thawed halibut youre
eating on board tonight while your
floating hotel chugs through the
Hecate Strait to deliver its precious
load of geriatrics to the hungry
Visa-card-accepting denizens of our
northernmost and most mosquito-
infested state

Harm stops talking and gives Ricky a look Ricky keeps
sliming fish-

HARM
So

RICKY
Whats redolent

HARM
‘Having or emitting an odor

RICKY
People are gonna want to come here
because it smells

HARM
‘Pleasantly fragrant At least
thats what the crossword puzzle said

RICKY
Not talking about this place

HARM
Course theyre not The minute we
shut down theyll make this place
into a tourist attraction Theyll
disinfect the joint and you can get
a job in one of those cases like in
a museum those displays-

Harms wife AUDREY who is sliming fish speaks up-
White Revision 7698

AUDREY
Dioramas

HARM
In one of those dioramas Theyll
cover you with fake fish guts and put
a label underneath- Typical Filipino
Cannery Worker You just have to
keep still and hold your breath till
the tour group moves on

RICKY
Probably pay better than this

HARM
Ill be out on the water in my boat
and every time I make a set therell
be one of those floating nursing
homes with five hundred sonsabitches
and theircameras capturing the
moment

AUDREY
And what boat is that

My boat

AUDREY
You dont have a boat honey
Remember

HARM
Oh yes I do Im gettin it back
Today

EXT PARTY GROUNDS - WEDDING RECEPTION 4

NOELLE a high school girl dressed in a white stewards
uniform circulates among WEDDING GUESTS with a tray of hors
doeuvres An outdoor wedding RECEPTION is in progress a
BAND singing and playing from a bandstand in the BG-

NOELLE
Would you like some hors doeuvres
Excuse me would you like some hors
doeuvres

JOE GASTINEAU a handyman in his 40s passes with a case of
wine He and Noelle have a friendly flirtatious
relationship-

JOE
Hey Nice uniform

NOELLE
The brides parents said they wanted
uniforms so Frankie and Lou rented
these I look stupid
6498

JOE
You look like an angel

NOELLE
I look like a little white maggot

Noelle sees a GUEST approaching-

NOELLE (shifting gears)
Would you like some hors doeuvres

The guest grabs a handful and a napkin and fades back into
the crowd-

NOELLE
How come you dont have to wear one

JOE
This is the official unemployed pulp
mill workers uniform-

NOELLE
Right

We FOLLOW as Noelle wades back into the crowd Joe continues
with the wine-

JOE
Keep smiling

NOELLE
Would you like a cheese ball

Noelle brings us to the father of the bride ALBRIGHT anda
logging executive BAINES-

ALBRIGHT
Thank you darling What Im saying
is you have to look at the big
picture You clear-cut the trees
what do you have

We HOLD with the men as Noelle circulates-

BAINES
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of timber-

ALBRIGHT
But its ugly-

BAINES
The point is to get the trees down
without spending a fortune

ALBRIGHT
Youre thinking short-term Phil
Like my mother always told me- You
Dont Shit In Your Front Yard
6498

BAINES
Your mother said that

ALBRIGHT
Constantly Our people cruise by an
island got their binoculars out
the ones that can still see God
bless them- what do we show them We
show them a little Indian fish camp
some totem poles maybe we show them
a black bear foraging for breakfast
in the early morning mist We do not
show them deforested hillsides and
logging equipment Phil Heavy
machinery they can see in New Jersey

BAINES
The loggers have as much right-

ALBRIGHT
We all have to make our living Im
not arguing that Cut the trees in
the interior make it into a parking
lot- just quit with the chainsaws
when you get to where people can see
Were trying to develop themes for
each area up here- The Whales
Causeway ‘Island of the Raven
People Kingdom of the Salmon
Lumberland -

BAINES
Thats us-

ALBRIGHT
Thats a turn-of-the-century sawmill
with a little water-powered generator
and a gift shop Thats history
Phil not industry History is our
future here not our past

Albright sees his daughter go by in her wedding dress-

ALBRIGHT (beaming)
Will you look at her She looks like
a million bucks

NOELLE (returning)
Would you like some more gentlemen

ALBRIGHT

Find the little girl with the shrimp
and send her over this way would
you Thanks honey Its like with
these kayak outfitters Phil- I know
the jellybean colors are easy to spot
if theres trouble but it spoils the
ambience-
6498

Noelle looks to the stage as the GUESTS APPLAUD as the band
finishes its number The woman singer DONNA DE ANGELO
steps to the microphone-

DONNA
Thank you Thank you very much

STAGE

Donna in her early 40s is smiling but clearly upset about
something-

DONNA
Thank you This is kind of a special
day for me- I know its a special one
for all of you- this is my last
appearance with Randy Mason and the
Pipeline-

POLITE APPLAUSE from the audience The accordion player
glares at her as the other BAND MEMBERS exchange surprised
looks-

DONNA
Ill be continuing my run as a solo
performer at the Golden Nugget saloon
and pocket billiard emporium
downtown Port Henrys answer to
Carnegie Hall-

She looks daggers at the accordion player-

DONNA
While Randy will be rapidly sinking
back into the relative obscurity that
he so richly deserves

A few NERVOUS TITTERS from the guests close to the bandstand-

DONNA
The time weve spent together has
seemed- much longer than it probably
was and with that in mind Id like
to dedicate this next song to him
Fellas-

Donna turns her back to the audience tells the players what
she wants and then turns back to launch into a SONG about a
man who has broken a womans heart one time too many She is
very good able to control her strong emotional voice
despite the obvious tension on stage The accordion player
sulks as Donna looks him straight in the eye-

NOELLE

We watch over Noelles shoulder for a moment then she turns
to us nearly in tears-
6498

NOELLE
Dammit

We FOLLOW Noelle toward the prep tables to refill her tray
Her employers FRANKIE and LOU are having a heated argument
with Harmon King in his street clothes now as they rapidly
prep bread baskets and side dishes for the meal-

LOU
Idont see where we have anything to
discuss

HARM

Youre not gonna take that attitude
if I show up with a lawyer-

LOU
A lawyer

Noelle grabs more hors doeuvres and hurries away realizing
she shouldnt be hearing this-

LOU
Youre threatening us with a lawyer
In schools now when they teach
estates when they teach contracts
you know who they use Francine
here thats who- she wrote the
fucking book

FRANKIE
Its not really a text book Louise-

LOU
I on the other hand was a criminal
attorney Some of the business
practices that you engaged in-

HARM
Thats bullshit-

LOU
You see a couple dykes wander up from
Seattle you figure heres easy
pickins-

FRANKIE
Louise-

LOU
When we bought these properties
which you had run to the ground-

HARM
That is not true-
6498

LOU
When we bought them from you
promises were made about plumbing
about dry rot about roofing
materials-

HARM
I had a cash-flow situation-

LOU
Promises which you did not keep-

HARM
I gave you my boat

LOU
Yes as collateral-

HARM
Its worth more than those repairs-

LOU
It is worth relatively little on the
market Weve had it appraised-

HARM
I gave you my license Thats worth
a--

FRANKIE
Were not fishermen Harmon

HARM
Exactly Thats why Im saying I
take the boat I go out make my
limit the cash goes to you I get my
boat back

FRANKIE
Whoah whoah whoah- we paid the
docking fees all winter we had the
engine overhauled and now that
theres fish again you expect to
waltz in take qur boat as if you
still owned it like you never
defaulted on any of this stuff-

HARM
Youre worse than the damn bank-

FRANKIE
We let you take advantage of us like
this what does that say to everybody
in Port Henry It says do not take
these women seriously-

HARM
You come up here you bust peoples
balls-
6498

FRANKIE
If your balls are being busted
Harmon its because you stuck em in
a vise and you yanked the handle-

LOU
The screw

FRANKIE
What

LOU
The jaws of a vise are moved by a
screw or a lever You dont call it
a handle

FRANKIE
Thank you Louise The point being
Mr King if youre feeling pressure
on your testicles you have only
yourself to blame

HARM
So youre just gonna take the hit
let my boat rot in the harbor-

LOU
You misrepresented the properties to
us Harmon You tried to swindle us
into keeping your boat from being
repossessed by the bank by assigning
the title to-

HARM
Look you gals already said youre
not fishermen-

FRANKIE
The last I heard there was no
shortage of guys moping around town
willing to work for a piece

LOU
A share
FRANKIE
What
LOU

On a boat in you know- nautical
terms its called working for a
share

FRANKIE (curt)
Thank you

LOU
Francine if were going to do this
we should get the terminology right
6498

FRANKIE
in carpentry Louise I bow to your
superior knowlege You are a person
who reads tool catalogues for
enjoyment Boats however you know
as little as I do which is next to
nothing-

HARM
You think youre gonna find somebody
in this town to take my boat out and
fish on my license Youre both
fucking crazy

STAGE

Donna finishes her song and walks tight-faced off the stage
The accordion player instantly leads the band into a ZYDECO
SONG--

NOELLE

Noelle watches from the crowd unhappy-

INT LODGE PANTRY - EVENING 27

Joe and Noelle are stacking food supplies from crates onto
the shelves in the walk-in pantry-

6498

JOE
If the temperature of the water in
the stream changes a couple of
degrees if it gets slightly more or
less acid any little change it can
mean the salmon wont return there

NOELLE
Where do they go

JOE
Probably they just keep looking along
the coast till---

He shrugs-

NOELLE
So the whole run disappears

JOB
Its been known to happen Theyre
pretty much hard-wired fish not
many options People though
theyve got bigger brains they can
guess at the future make decisions-

NOELLE
They just do a really lousy job of it

Joe smiles-

NOELLE
I hate it when theyre stranded out
in the air and their gills are
working and they have that desperate
look-

JOE
Theyre drowning In air

Noelle shoots a look at Joe watching him work-
NOELLE
What do you think it feels like to
drown
Joe stacks a few more items before he answers-
JOE

experience

DONNA
So you must like it

JOE
Dont think Id do so well down south-
you know cities

DONNA
How come youre not married

Joe laughs at her directness-

DONNA
Sorry if you dont want to say-

JOE
No no- its probably the same reason
youre not married-

DONNA
Because such a high percentage of men
you meet are jerks

JOE (smiles)
No-

DONNA
Because women are scarce and winters
are long-

JOE
Thats true but-

DONNA
Because youre looking for someone
fun to be with who understands your
bullshit but is still crazy about you-

» JOE
Thats a bit much to ask for

DONNA
No its not

She means it There is a brief silence-
6498

JOE
So have you like- recorded songs

DONNA
I made a lotof demos Im not
exactly up here to try and be
discovered At my age--- it doesnt
make a whole lot of sense- my so-
called career

JOE
Why do you still do it

She struggles to give him an honest answer-

DONNA
Almost every night doesnt matter
where Im singing which song it is-
all of a sudden Ill hook into it-
Ill be feeling whatever it is the
song is about and I can hear my
voice feel it I can tell that Im

putting it across--- Moments of
grace
JOE

Uh-huh

DONNA
You know what Im saying

JOE
I do

DONNA

Its totally selfish

JOE
Tough to walk away from something you
feel that way about

DONNA
Ive put my kid through a lot- moving
all the time But when I take a
straight job- bank teller
waitressing whatever- Im so-
defeated- I dont want her to look at
me

JOE
But she thinks its cool you singing-

DONNA
Shes convinced my only purpose in
life is to cause her embarrassment
and pain

JOE
Teenager-
6498

DONNA
Yeah

Another silence Joe takes the leap-

JOE
So would you like to do- something

DONNA
Something

JOE
Its real pretty country around here
I could take you-

DONNA
I gotta warn you theres certain
things- the one with the long skinny
boats and the paddles

JOE
Kayaking-

DONNA

cliff you plunge to your death

JOE
Climbing-

gear instead of clothing- I dont do
it

JOE

fortune-seekers swept through Port
Henry on their way to Skagway the
Chilkoot Pass and the Yukon gold
fields

Bobby pushes through the stream of tourists into a CU He
seems nervous checking around to see if anybody is watching
him-

DENISE (OS)
They were desperate men men willing
to perish in search of the one Big
Strike that every prospector dreamed

of -
Bobby moves past us out of the shot as Donna follows a CRUISE
DIRECTOR back toward the ship-
CRUISE DIRECTOR

It could be the entire cruise yes

or we might have you just do one leg
lay over at one of our stops then
work the next leg on a different ship-

DONNA
How much time would I spend at home

CRUISE DIRECTOR
We like to think of our vessels as a
kind of home-

DONNA

Its a nomadic lifestyle no question
about that but the rewards are-

Noelle brings us to the next table where Albright is
entertaining a trio of INVESTORS-

ALBRIGHT
What are you buying when you get on
a roller coaster Not risk because
nobody but fringe consumers want
that but the illusion of risk- being
hurled to the edgé of danger but
knowing youll never have to cross it

Noelle lays the plates out--

ALBRIGHT
Mr Disneys innovation was to put
those carnival rides and attractions
into a story context where you could
imagine yourself a character in one
of his cartoon epics as you floated
through a Plaster-of-Paris jungle
The obvious next step- and this is
the core of our proposal- is not
bigger and better facsimiles of
Nature but Nature itself

EXT MARINA - EVENING 57
We see the Raven pulling into the dock-

JOE
Theres a lot of factors Theres
tide- is it with you are you plowing
into it is it slack wheres the
moon in its cycle- theres wind
which can jump around on you when
youre ducking in and out of these
islands- theres the size of the
channel youre going through the
configuration of the bottom-

DONNA
You still know all this stuff

Yeah- as much as you can know it
Its like you spend enough time with
somebody even if you dont see them
for a long while you still recognize
their moods

JOE
Whatd you expect

JOE
Or Beethoven-

guy who lives alone or youre a
serial killer

Joe laughs-

DONNA

I mean my track record for
conciously choosing men is so
horrendous if I ever hook up with
somebody good itll be pure luck

She steps to Joe kisses him steps back to look at him-

DONNA
But the odds have got to be in my
favor by now-

They kiss again rapidly getting excited and making out
standing up They waltz over to a wall for some support
starting to breathe hard and pull at clothes till Donna’

consciously steps to the head of the room She takes her
story from the teachers hand turns to face the class-

‘NOELLE (softly)
The Water Baby The midwife knew at
first look it wasnt a normal
delivery-

TEACHER (0S)
A little louder Noelle-

NOELLE (speaks up a bit)
The midwife knew at first look it
wasnt a normal delivery The
newborn was cold as it struggled and
gasped in her arms wet and cold with
a bluish pallor that did not change
once she cleared its throat with her
finger It fought for air but did
not open its mouth The mother
sweat-soaked in her bedsheets the
father video camera dropping away
from his apprehensive face her
assistant already on the phone to
the life support unit- all seemed to
move in a heavy slow- motion as if
under water The midwife was halfway
down the hall with the newborn before
she noticed them- a tiny half- moon
slit below each ear lined with a
deep crimson membrane Gills-

Noelle tightens staring at her mother-

Noelle just turns away shaking her head She is really

upset -

Donna tries to get around and see Noelles face
her-

DONNA
Hes not the guy you liked out there
Noelle

‘Noelle stonewalls her-
DONNA

Honey hes my age Older What did

Nothing from Noelle-

‘NOELLE (put upon)

Donna sits trying to figure out how to deal with this-

6498

DONNA
Maybe this is good maybe its a sign-
we dont usually go for the same
type guys-

Noelle gives her a stifling glare-

DONNA
If I had known you were interested in
him honey I- but I didnt know
did I So you can be mad at me but
not too mad okay This is not a
willful boyfriend-swiping type of

looking out the window-

behind a tree-

Joe wearing only underpants and shoes creeps back into the
woods -

Joe returns to the fallen log to find Donna and Noelle
starting to dress in their damp cold clothes They are all
drawn and shivering-

They all turn as the WHINE of SKIFF MOTOR starts up Joe
goes to one knee-

Hop on

Noelle gets on his back and he stands then begins to climb
diagonally through the trees Donna grabs the rest of the
clothes and follows-

The prow of the skiff bumps the little beach LEGS appear as
the MEN drag it ashore-

DONNA
And thats like up Shit Creek without

JOE

Pretty much I figure we should head
around toward the channel while its

stream Well be okay without food
for awhile but water-

He wads a sock into the toe of one of his shoes and hands it
to Noelle-

JOE
Try this

NOELLE
What are you going to use

JOE
Ill be careful where I step Go
ahead

Noelle sticks her foot into the shoe starts to lace it up
Donna holds her head in her hands-

DONNA
This is not happening to us This is
only a dramatization of somebody
elses pathetic story

JOE
It could be worse Its not so cold

Donna digs in her pocket and produces her cigarette lighter-

DONNA

smokes and CRACKLES Noelle sits as close to the fire as
she can while Donna fans the smoke away with a shingle Joe
has his knife out and is trying to make a pair of sandals
from piece of ruined carpet The interior of the house is a
chaos of gutted furniture and sagging walls Donna coughs
from the smoke-

Still a mess but theyve cleared more space for themselves on
the solid part of the floor We FOLLOW Noelle to a sodden
mass of rags and papers stuffed into the fireplace that she
begins to toss wad by wad onto a section of carpet She
Pauses coming up with a small leather-bound book with a
clasp on it She undoes the clasp The pages are damp but
still intact-

She looks around crosses to a spot on the floor where light
is slanting in from a hole in the roof sits and begins to
read-

6498

NOELLE (reading 0S)
Papa and Mother and I have come here
to make a go at the fox farming
trade If this pans out says Papa -

NOELLE (reading)
-next year I can go back to finish
with school I offered to get on at
the cannery to help out when we were
in town but Papa says there is too
much trash working there He was a
logger but fell while he was topping
and now has headaches and dizziness
that prevent him from many of the
trades other men pursue This way
he says we can live in the Great
Outdoors and operate our own business
at the same time which is every
mans true desire Mother doesnt
care for it

NOELLE (reading)
We have transported a dozen breeding
pairs of the blue-pelt foxes and put
them in their pens They are lovely
to look at but nervous and I need to
mind my fingers when I am near them
When the vixens are ready to bear we
will separate them to be alone with
their litter Papa is building a
fish trap in the stream as he hopes
to catch the returning chum for fox-
food I expect it will be a hard
life but work is scarce back in town
and Papas spirits were getting low
The people who built our little house
tried to make it fishing and rowing
out for stray logs to sell back to
the mill but they gave up after a
few seasons Mother goes on about
how she will miss female company and
that I will have to be her special
friend I know that Papa thinks he
has been a disappointment to her and
sometimes she doesnt do much to hide
it I will be lonely here I can
tell but it should be a great
adventure like Caddie in Caddie
Woodlawn I will try to bea
faithful writer Dear Diary and tell
you my innermost thoughts

Noelle puts the diary in her lap looks at them-

DONNA
Wow Read some more
NOELLE

INT HOUSE - NIGHT 100

Joe wakes with a gasp as if hes been holding his breath
Donna wakes beside him All three are sleeping around the
embers of the fire-

DONNA

Donna looks over to Noelle still sleeping huddled up
against her under Joes jacket-

DONNA
All I want is for her to be happy and
safe Shes not either
Joe disentangles himself from them squats to feed the fire-
DONNA
People must have always smelled like
smoke
She watches Joe for a long moment-

DONNA
Whats the matter

He doesnt answer brooding-

DONNA

JOE
You cant always save people

They exchange a look then Joe moves to cover Noelles feet-
EXT SHORE - MORNING

Noelle struggles to drag driftwood across the rocks

6498

We PAN

to see Joe and Donna piling wood and trash from the house at

the edge of the woods-
CLOSER

Joe lights a stick with some dry moss wrapped around it with

Donnas lighter Noelle arrives and lays the wood down

lights several sections of the pile
then flames start up-

JOE

It begins to smoke

We need to feed this a couple times
a day When the skys like this it
wont be easy to spot but on a clear

day-

DONNA
What if it rains

JOE

It rains or the tide comes in too
high well probably have to start

from scratch

DONNA

And we hope somebody sees this and

wonders what the story is

NOELLE

Somebody who doesnt want to kill us

Donna gives Noelle a hard look-

JOE
Its a possibility

DONNA
You two are a great match
Doom

Theres no use pretending-

DONNA

Gloom and

They are both looking at her now-

Joe
6498

DONNA
You assume that bad shit is gonna
happen bad shit happens

She roughly throws some more branches of the fire-

DONNA (mutters)
I dont see the point

102 EXT WOODS - AFTERNOON 102

Joe is trying to make a fish-trap from pieces of the old fox
pens as Noelle looks on- So

JOE
The fish go in through here then
they cant turn around and get out
Thats the idea anyway This wire
is kind of brittle

NOELLE
Whered you learn all this stuff

JOE
My old man taught me

NOELLE
You did lots of stuff with him

JOE
When he had something to do and he
needed somebody to swear at he took
me along

Not the answer Noelle wanted to hear-

NOELLE
My fathers a composer My real

NOELLE

She fingers the mesh on the trap-
NOELLE
Think well catch anything
103 INT HOUSE - NIGHT 103

Diary time again A fire in the fireplace Each of them has
some kind of improvised seat-

NOELLE
The house is small but cozy now
that we have cleaned it up and made
it our own

6498

NOELLE
I have my own room and at night I
can hear the owls calling back in the
woods and our foxes yipping when
something wild comes by Yesterday I
saw whales feeding in the inlet
going under for awhile then bursting
up through the surface with a great
spouting of air and crying of gulls
There are blueberries everywhere My
fingers are stained purple with them
though Mother insists I will be
attacked by bears if I stray too far
from the house Papas headaches are
better and I help him clear the fish
trap and prepare the feed for the
animals It is unpleasant sticky
work but must be done I have
gotten stronger handling the skiff
and Mother chides Papa for making a
boy of me but I dont mind The
days it doesnt rain are Gods glory
and most of our vixens are close to
giving birth Some days I will go
for hours without speaking and feel
I am changing perhaps posessed by
the soul of some long-dead Indian
girl or perhaps the spirit-of a she-
wolf This morning I snuck up on
Papa felling a spruce for the
fireplace and watched him for a long
time without him seeing me Perhaps
I shall learn to become invisible

I made
blueberry pancakes Mother says if
she eats any more fish she will grow
fins and swim back to town At night
she has me kneel with her to pray

Noelle lays the diary down-

DONNA
Sounds like Moms not the Wilderness

Family type

JOE
Sounds like it might be in the
Depression Thats what- fifty
sixty years ago-

DONNA
You gonna read us more

Noelle considers then opens the diary again-

6498

NOELLE
The terrible birthing has begun We
think one of the vixens has eaten her
litter The kits the ones that
survived are lovely once their eyes
open Papa told me not to handle
them but when he is off sometimes I
do Their heads are squarish and
fluffy

She closes the diary and shuts the clasp with finality-

DONNA (smiles)
Fox babies

FADE OUT

EXT SHORE - MORNING 104

Noelle is picking her way across the tidal mud poking into
air holes with a long stick to dig out clams We see the
plume of SMOKE from the signal fire far behind her She
suddenly CRIES OUT almost stepping on something She steps
back frightened then approaches slowly We see that it is
Bobbys corpse half-buried inthe mud CRABS chewing on it
Noelle contemplates it for a long moment She flicks one of
the crabs away with the stick Feeling shaky she sits on a
rock-

INT WOODS - AFTERNOON 105

We FOLLOW Joe lugging a large rock He bends and places it
on a pile of similar rocks filling up a depression in the
forest floor Donna and Noelle stand watching-

DONNA
Isnt that enough

JOE

Dont want the bears to dig him out
(to Noelle)

Im real sorry you had to see that

DONNA
Killing somebody for money-

JOE
By the middle of the winter up here
people kill each other cause theyre
bored He took a risk and it didnt
work out for him thats all

He lifts up another stone heaves it onto the pile-
EXT SHORE - DAY 106

We hear Noelle read softly from the diary her voice flat as
we watch Joe walking moodily along the shoreline-

NOELLE

6498

NOELLE (VO)
Winter has locked us in its icy
embrace The pelts of the animals
are thick and bluish and our home is
blanketed with snow Papa calls it
Limbo because it sure isnt Heaven
and its too cold to be Hell Mother
wondered about Purgatory but he said
no Purgatory has an end to it
Dont torture me so said Mother

Noelle sits up by the treeline crying watching Joe in the-

distance-

DONNA

NOELLE (VO)
The salmon we dried have run out
The kits are eating solid food now
and it is hard to keep up with them
Papa went to the far side of the
island and shot a pair of sea lions
but could only bring one back without
tipping over in the skiff I had to
help him with the cross-cut saw
breaking it down to pieces that we
keep frozen in the shed Papa said
its just meat but I tried not to
look at what I was doing The other
sea lion had been gotten to by a bear
when Papa rowed back

Donna sits by the signal fire watching the sky-

‘INT HOUSE

NOELLE (V0O)
We put a piece of the frozen meat in
each of the pens and the foxes fight
over it and gnaw at it and the
outside melts from the heat of their
little tongues Mother wont deal
with them anymore She has grown
silent with the shorter darker days
and only now and again will she break
out into one of her Bible songs She
asks me to join her but we dont
harmonize well

- NIGHT

Noelle reads by the fire Joe and Donna listening in moody

silence-

NOELLE (V0O)
I have a dream about Fox He isa
young man who comes for me on
snowshoes dressed in the blue pelts

6498

NOELLE (V0)

His skin and hair are dark but His
eyes are ice-blue All the others
here are paired He says Papa and
Mother the sires and the vixens but
I am alone and He cant let that
continue Sometimes in the dream He
stays with us but usully He picks me
up and carries me to His own island

Papa says if we can get the
animals through the winter they are
a Gold Mine He says fortunes have
been started on less He says if he
keeps having his dizziness I will
have to go hunting with him the next
time The burns from where Mother
hit him with the bacon grease are
only pink now healing though the
hair doesnt grow on that part of his
jaw I am sewing a sampler

She closes the diary Donna and Joe watch the fire thinking-

EXT STREAM - MORNING 108

Time has passed Noelle standing thigh-deep in the stream
yanks the jerry-rigged fish trap to the surface There is a
very large salmon caught in it flapping desperately as it
hits the air She CRIES OUT and drops the trap then gets
her courage and hauls it up again She smiles-

EXT WOODS - MORNING 109

Joe and Donna embrace leaning up against a tree holding
tight rocking a little clinging like their lives depend on
it-

NOELLE

Noelle stands back in the trees watching mutely the salmon
slung over her shoulder with a cord through its gills-

EXT SHORE - AFTERNOON 110

Joe pulls a flat stone out from the embers of the signal
fire blows the ash off it He lays thin strips of the
salmon meat on it-

JOE
You dont worry about burning it up
this wayjust flip it over after a
minute-

We SHIFT to see Donna and Noelle Noelle sits away from
them sulking shivering slightly-

JOE (to Noelle)
You laid the trap back in
6498

NOELLE
Yeah

JOE
Indians used to smoke everything they
couldnt eat hope that it lasted the
winter -

Donna is looking at the sky-

DONNA
Good day for planes

NOELLE
Nobodys coming

DONNA
Dont be negative-

NOELLE
In two weeks how many planes have we
seen Zero

DONNA
We heard that one

JOE
There would have been more if they
were searching for us here

DONNA
What does that mean

JOE
Bobby may have told people at the
dock we were headed in a different
direction -He thought people were
after him-

NOELLE
People were after him-

JOE
Yeah Anyway they may be searching
in a totally different area

NOELLE
Stupid-

DONNA
Noelle-

NOELLE

Trying to impress your boyfriend
drag us out on a boat-

DONNA
Thats enough
A silence

6498

NOELLE
Its true

DONNA
Look I am cold I am hungry I am
dirty and I am scared shitless just
like you But Im trying to help us
get through this thing-

NOELLE
I shouldnt be here I shouldnt be
in this state I shouldnt-

DONNA
Nobody is to blame for this-

NOELLE
Yeah right-

DONNA
When you are of age Noelle you are
free to go fuck your own life up
Until that day Im afraid its my
job to fuck it up for you

Donna looks to Joe-

DONNA
You could help me with this-

NOELLE
Hes not my father

DONNA
Thank God for that

NOELLE
Whats that mean

DONNA
Your father would have gone off
picking berries or something and
thats the last wed have heard from
him

NOELLE
Thats not true

DONNA
How would you know He was in the
same roomwith you maybe twice-

NOELLE
You wouldnt let him-

DONNA
If you cross his mind once a year
max Id be surprised-
6498

NOELLE
Every Christmas-

DONNA
Oh Noelle-

NOELLE
He sent me a bike he sent me a
watch he sent me a dollhouse-

DONNA
iI sent the watch

This shuts Noelle up She had no idea Donna isnt happy
she let it out-

DONNA
I sent the bike- all of it I
figured when you were little you had
Santa Claus the Easter Bunny you
might as well have a father in
California who sent you stuff

Noelle glares at her tears in her eyes Joe flips the
salmon hoping to stay out of the crossfire-

NOELLE (muted)
I hated that dollhouse

DONNA
I know honey but you wouldnt let

me exchange it cause it was from
him Remember

She sees that Noelle is shaking-

DONNA
Are you okay

NOELLE
Im great Im kickin-

DONNA (moving)
Let me feel your forehead-

Noelle pushes her hand away-

NOELLE
Leave me alone

Donna backs off She uses a piece of seaweed to pick up the
hot stone offers Noelle the salmon-

DONNA
Eat something

6498

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

Noelle reads solemnly slowly She is by the fire and
wrapped in Joes jacket but still trembling with a fever-

NOELLE
I was the one who found them It
was time to clean the scat from the
pens so I had the shovel and the
buckets and then there was blood
everywhere in the snow All of them
torn and smashed even my little
kits A bear says Papa though when
has a bear got into a half-dozen
different pens without breaking the
gates Mother says nothing but she
is only a black spot these days and
refused to celebrate Christmas The
pelts are ruined of course
worthless and our long care is for
naught Papa couldnt speak when he
saw them He says his head hurts
trying to think a way out of our
dilemma

Joe shoots a look at Donna to see how she is taking this-

NOELLE

I dreamed that Fox came and was angry
for what we let happen that He held
me down on the snow and I felt His
hot breath on my face felt it bitter
in my throat and felt his ice-eyes
cutting into me I wish He would
come soon
Mother sleeps with me now and it is
cramped and tense You would think
another body under the covers would
bring warmth but I wake feeling
drained like she has pulled all the
heat from me I am doing the cooking
now and my eyes are always red from
the smoke The wood is too big for
the cookstove but the axe has gone
missing and we cant break it down

Mother says Hell is a cold place
Maybe I am the soul not of a she-
wolf but of a soaring bird that
flies south every winter and my
heart is so sick because I am not
supposed to be here in this cold
this dark this wet Maybe I am like
the air in this house the air that
does not move when Papa and Mother
pass in silence dead smoky air that
smells of wool and old bacon

Tears begin to roll down Noelles cheeks as she reads-

6498

NOELLE
We threw the animals on the rocks for
the tide to deal with Papa cried
FADE OUT
EXT SHORE - DAY i 112

Noelle is feeding the signal fire She hears something
stands shakily to look’ up shading her eyes-

WIDER

Over Noelles shoulder we see a FLOAT PLANE flying over the
other side of the inlet Suddenly it banks and heads right
toward her-

NOELLE
Excited she starts to yell-

NOELLE
Its coming Its coming

INT WOODS - AFTERNOON 113

Donna is dragging fallen branches toward the shore She
hears Noelles VOICE drops the branches and begins to run-

EXT SHORE 114

Donna breaks out of the woods and begins to run toward the
signal fire Joe comes out of the woods behind her looks to
the sky then follows running-

JOE
Donna Careful

NOELLE - PLANE

Noelle is in the FG as the float plane lands in the inlet and
taxis straight toward her-

INT PLANE - POV 115

We see through the windshield as the shore approaches A
young girl by a fire joined by an older woman and man-

EXT SHORE - TRIO 116
Noelle and Donna are beaming Joe worried-

REVERSE

The little float plane slows as it nears the shore Joe

wades out into the water to grab hold of the float tether as

the engine cuts off and the prop stops turning Smilin Jack
steps out onto the float on his side-
6498

-‘SMILIN JACK
You folks picked a hell of a spot for
a clambake

DONNA (stepping forward)
Weve been stuck here forever Weve
been stranded

SMILIN JACK (looking past them)
Any more of you

DONNA
Just us We were on Bobbys boat-
Joes brother And he was- murdered

Joe shoots Donna a look Its clear he doesnt totally trust
Jack Jack looks at Joe-

JOE
Im not sure who did it We jumped
off at night-- there were a couple

fellas came in looking and we hid
then they pulled anchor-

He shrugs-

SMILIN JACK
Damn How long you been here

DONNA
A week and a half We found what was
left of an old house weve been
holing up there at night

SMILIN JACK (shakes his head)
And I was hoping you people could
help me My radios shot Im low on
fuel and Im heading into bad weather

JOE (suspicious)
Your radios gone

SMILIN JACK
Crapped out on me a half hour back
Not even static

He looks to the sky looks at the water-

SMILIN JACK
Tides going out fast Im gonna
have to turn this thing around and
try to get out of here send help-

DONNA
Take my daughter then Shes sick-
6498

SMILIN JACK (grave)
Id love to but I cant handle the
weight Believe me itll be safer
here-

DONNA
She barely weighs a thing-

SMILIN JACK
I got to jettison whatever I can to
have a fighting chance Sorry ladies

He pulls off his jacket tosses it to Noelle-

SMILIN JACK (to Joe)
You want to give me a hand with this

He reaches in and starts tossing things on shore-

SMILIN JACK
I got a first aid kit in here- no
food though-

DONNA AND NOELLE

Noelle is shaking again Donna puts her arms around her
grim-

DONNA
Well have to spend one more night
out here honey thats all Then
theyll come and get us-

JOE AND SMILIN JACK

Joe helps Jack wrestle the tiny plane around to face out to
sea They speak quietly enough that the women cant hear-

SMILIN JACK
Im real sorry to hear about Bobby
man I used to party with him up in
Haines--

JOE
Whats the story

SMILIN JACK
Whats what story

JOE
Who sent you

Jack meets Joes eyes for a long moment then gives a furtive
look toward the shore-
DONNA AND

Donna and

6498

SMILIN JACK
Couple guys- Mr Smith and Mr Brown-
never seen em before but I dont
think theyre up here to save the
whales They laid some serious money
on me to poke around see if I could
spot three people roughing it in the
boonies

JOE
And if you saw them

SMILIN JACK
Just go back and tell them where

JOE
Whyd you land then

SMILIN JACK
Im on the level about the radio and
the rest of it Joe I was hoping to
find some sport fishermen with a
short-wave and a cooler full of brew

NOELLE

Noelle watch Donna reassuring her daughter-

DONNA
Well sit in a hot bath for a day or
so while people bring us everything
we want to eat and drink and then
well get into a soft bed with clean
sheets and just hibernate-

PLANE MEN
Smilin Jack gets into the pilots seat and buckles up-

SMILIN JACK
If Id known the deal with Bobby Id
of turned em in- you have to trust me
on that

JOE
Right

Jack leans out and calls out to the women on shore-

SMILIN JACK
Hang in there ladies I11 be back
with the cavalry tomorrow

He looks to Joe-

SMILIN JACK
Wish me luck buddy
6498

Joe says nothing Jack grins shuts the door gives Joe
thumbs up Joe steps off the float and moves away as Jack
revs the engine and begins to taxi away-

SHORE

Joe joins Donna and Noelle as the plane gathers speed and
takes off from the water-

DONNA
Were saved Were gonna make it
JOE
Yeah
INT HOUSE - NIGHT 117

The three sit around the fire Joe speaks carefully not
wanting to dishearten them but deeply troubled It has
begun to RAIN outside-

JOE
The last I heard he was flying out of
Anchorage kicking square halibut out -
of a cargo plane-

DONNA
Whats that

JOE
Marijuana bales You fly over a spot
on the water somebody signals with
lights or gives you a code over the
radio and you dump your load The
people in the boat below fish the
bales out and take them to the next
stage

DONNA
Hesa drug dealer

JOE
Hes whatever pays best and he can
get away with Hes got balls and
hes never gotten caught or bought
the farm Bad weather bad company-
you got the cash Smilin Jacks your
man

DONNA
He hit on me a couple times at the
bar He seemed like a nice guy

JOE
I didnt say people dont like him
I said I dont trust him
6498

NOELLE
You think he might tell those men
And bring them back here

JOE
I dont know I didnt believe him
about the radio- and weve got some
personal history-

DONNA
Like what

JOE
His brother drowned on a fishing
boat It was my fault

Donna ponders this a moment-

She turns

DONNA (deciding)
He wouldnt do that to us Hes not
a killer

NOELLE
How do you know

DONNA
Ive looked in his eyes I can tell
things about a person-

NOELLE
Like you could tell that Dwayne in
Colorado Springs wasnt cheating on
you with the cocktail waitress-

DONNA
This is different -

NOELLE
Or that Lyle would néver hit you-

DONNA
Once he hit me once and I walked-

NOELLE
But you didnt see it coming did you

DONNA
We dont have any choice Youre
sick its getting colder we cant

to Joe for support-

DONNA

JOE

Donna looks at the rain pouring down outside-

EXT SHORE

the opening to the outside watching the RAIN blast down-

DONNA

JOE

DONNA
Humor me okay

JOE
It was worse yesterday And the day
before We just have to hang on

DONNA
The signal fire is probably out-

JOE
As soon as it clears well get it

Donna crosses to Noelle feels her forehead worried She
sees something digs- comes up with the diary Joe watches
as she opens the clasp starts to thumb through the pages
She frowns-

6498

DONNA
Its blank
JOE
What
DONNA

The pages are blank after the first
couple entries The foxes havent
even had their babies yet

They both look at Noelle Donna closes the diary clasps it
shut carefully replaces it-

INT HOUSE - NIGHT 422

We start on the FIRE a bit smoky but comforting against the
sound of the RAIN stillpelting down We PAN to Noelle
wrapped in as many layers as possible eyes bright with fever
as she ceremoniously opens the diary and fixes Joe and Donna
with a look She reads softly-

NOELLE

We wont bury her on the island She
made me promise She whispered it
hissed it in my ear one night when
she was laying hard beside me in bed
Promise me She wouldnt listen to
anything else
We had come back from looking for
deer Papa and me signs at the salt
lick but nothing to shoot at I was
putting his rifle back where he hid
it in the shed roof when I heard him
cry out He wouldnt let me in at
first though I hollered and struck
at the door He opened up when hed
got her down on the table but I saw
the black mark around her neck where
the cord was The fire had gone out
so our breath was showing Papa and
me and it was like long white sighs
of grief in the room and her mouth
open and hair crispy to the touch
We wrapped her in the afghan then I
got the fire going while Papa just
sat Nothing to say Later we found
the note and she told how the animals
were Satans handmaidens how their
sharp little eyes would not give her
peace so she killed them and threw
the axe in the woods We have
looked into ourselves she wrote
‘and what is there condemns us

Well take her off the
island come first thaw If Fox comes
then padding through the trees to be
my mate He will find us gone
6498

Donna and Noelle lock eyes for a long moment -

DONNA
Thats it

NOELLE
Thats it The last entry

Donna nods-

DONNA
Poor thing

NOELLE
Who

DONNA

Litte Anne Marie there Her mother
didnt love her enough to stick
around

NOELLE
She was crazy

DONNA
She still left her daughter in the
lurch’ Id never do that No matter

what
Donna and Noelle stare at each other Noelle fights not to
ery-
123 INT HOUSE - NIGHT 123

Joe sits by the fire Donna SINGS softly as she holds Noelle
asleep on her lap She stops strokes her daughters hair--

DONNA

I kind of look forward to her being
sick Its the only time she lets me
hold her anymore

JOE
Its some kind of fever

DONNA
Its in her lungs We have to get
her out of here

JOE (nods)

DONNA

Donna looks at him-

JOE
You both could- if you wanted-

DONNA

JOE
If youre not sick of me

DONNA (considers)
Hey- theres nobody in the world Id
rather be stranded in desperate
circumstances with Really But we

furniture-moving part We come with
a lot of baggage-

JOE
Hey-

DONNA

hopes up for me You know And when

half behind tree trunks watching the sky Noelle is
shivering wearing Smilin Jacks jacket Donna sees points-

DONNA

distant BUZZ-

Donna looks at her daughter then at Joe The BUZZ of the
Plane gets louder Donna looks to the plane approaching

Joe hesitates then starts out for her-

Joe steps up by Donna They exchange an uneasy look then
look back to the plane The BUZZING gets louder Noelle
appears between them shivering Donna puts her arm around
her Joe does the same The lost family watch the

approaching plane as the BUZZING gets louder We SLOWLY FADE
TO WHITE The BUZZING gets louder louder louder-
