DARKNESS A low wind stirs from far away
EXT NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

No cars in the driveway A single light on in an upstairs
window We hear A TEENAGE GIRL’S VOICE

TEENAGE GIRL (0S)
I wanted to talk I felt like last

night I don’t know Things were
starting to get kinda weird between
us

EASE IN on that upstairs window

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Glimpse a sliver of A BEDROOM because we’re looking out
from inside the bedroom closet The slightly open closet
door keeps us from seeing more

We stay exactly in this spot throughout

A teen girl sits on the floor This is DEBBIE She’s
talking to someone in her room

DEBBIE
It was fun for a while when we
first started playing But I
feel like youve changed

EASE OVER SLIGHTLY able to see a little more of Debbie
There’s something in front of her on the floor A GAME
BOARD Debbie’s fingers touching a heart-shaped wooden piece
on the board

She’s playing OUIJA with someone But from where we are
inside the closet we can’t see who it is

WE DRIFT UP AWAY FROM THE BOARD now so that we’re just on
Debbie’s face

DEBBIE (CONTD)
I mean you’re still my friend
right

Debbie sits there waiting

DEBBIE (CONTD)
C’mon Answer me

Suddenly Debbie’s expression shifts Fear in her eyes

DEBBIE (CONTD)
You know what This is our last
game I’m not playing ever again
I want you to leave Just get out

MOVEMENT A DARK SHAPE steps past the crack in the closet
We hear a THUD and now we are --

IN THE BEDROOM WITH DEBBIE

She sits there alone on the floor glancing over to the wide
open bedroom door as it comes to a rest against the wall As
if someone just left the room

The night wind creaks outside

Debbie gathers up the Ouija board and planchette and moves
quickly to her closet She opens the double doors about to
put the board away when --

-- there’s a noise SCRAPE Debbie glances over her
shoulder The room is still empty

She turns back Reaching to place the Ouija up on a shelf as
behind her --

-- there’s MOVEMENT in a mirror Unseen by Debbie because
she’s still reaching up to put the board away

The wooden planchette slips and falls landing at Debbie’s
feet She picks it up when suddenly --

-- BAM A loud sound in her room Debbie spins to see that
her bedside table lamp has fallen now slowly rolling on
the floor

Debbie stands there totally still Staring Her panicked
eyes scan the room All we hear is her BREATHING and the
WIND outside She turns slightly and a SHADOW falls
across her face We don’t see what she sees -- but someones
standing right there

Debbie stares Absolutely terrified Her lips tremble
about to say something when --

-- she’s PUSHED HARD into her closet It’s a blur She
falls back into her hanging clothes Getting twisted up ina
plastic dry cleaning bag

VERY CLOSE on Debbie -- and right before she can scream a
clear plastic dry cleaning bag suddenly PRESSES TIGHT AGAINST
HER FACE A split second shock and we instantly go --

INT DEBBIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- back into the bedroom The closet doors out of focus in
the background We catch the tail end of them closing shut
with a slight creak No sound comes from the closet Just
the wind outside

CHILLING MUSIC rises taking us to --

TITLE CREDITS A vintage turn of the century black and white
photograph of a parlor SEANCE GATHERING People in formal
attire at a table with a OUIJA BOARD at the center We hear
a WOMAN’‘S VOICE speak via a scratchy cylinder recording --

WOMANS VOICE
As friends weve gathered hearts
are true Spirits near we call to
you

More PHOTOS STOCK FILM FOOTAGE Moving through the
decades Groups of people playing the Ouija Even though
the times and styles change the Ouija board continues to
look the same We hear that familiar calling different
VOICES --

VARIOUS VOICES
As friends weve gathered hearts
are true Spirits near we call to
you

Polaroid shots Video footage Each Ouija game feels more
recent than the last The final image is TWO GIRLS Sitting on a floor with a Ouija board between them Dressed
for a sleepover It’s just a photo but we hear their
innocent young voices as they say the words --

TWO GIRLS
As friends weve gathered hearts
are true Spirits near we call to
you

From the photo of the two girls we DRIP TO BLACK LARGE BOLD
LETTERS appear one by one out of the darkness as if
conjured from the ether Spelling out a single mysterious
word in a familiar vintage font

OUIJA
SOUND rises A hard SCRATCHING CLOSE ON --

A PENCIL ON PAPER Cursive handwriting spills across the
page Beat

Suddenly the paper is ripped from a notebook and crumpled up
INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

ELENA “LAINE” MORENO 17 tosses the paper into the
wastebasket near her desk A few other crumpled notes
already in there

Its early Laine sits alone in the classroom Outside the

commotion of students arriving for the school day Laughing
distant voices Slamming of lockers out in the hallway

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
Laine regards another blank piece of paper She takes a
breath Writes out another note Her final words are the
only ones we see “Friends forever xoxo Laine”

Laine folds the paper into an origami note She sets it ona
far desk near the window as the bell rings and students start
filtering into the classroom

A MOMENT LATER Laine’s back in her desk ISABELLE takes the seat next to her and starts right in --

ISABELLE
What are we feeling this weekend

LAINE
It’s only Tuesday

ISABELLE
I know But I like to get a jump
(scrolling through her
phone)
Got multiple party options here
Small selective gathering or that
blow-out everyone’s going to

A GUY swoops in and gives Laine a kiss before taking the desk
behind her This is TREVOR TREVOR
She trying to steal my time again
Iz we don’t always have to tag
along You can fly solo

ISABELLE
Yeah Me showing up to a party
alone wouldn’t look pathetic at
all Not everyone has your perfect
couple situation

LAINE
Look at her acting like shes
not the one who breaks up with
every guy she goes out with

ISABELLE
I’m a picky bitch Can’t help it

A TEACHER MR SATLOF enters and starts passing out an exam

MR SATLOF
Okay Settle Books away I’m
putting thirty minutes on the
clock Please dazzle me with your
knowledge of all things John
Milton

Trevor leans in toward Laine whispering --

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
TREVOR
Yo You ready to throw down on
this iambic pentameter --

But Laine’s not paying attention She’s glancing back at the
desk where she put the note and it’s still empty The
note just sitting there
TREVOR (CONTD)
Laine This is the part where you
laugh
Laine snaps out of it Gives Trevor a smile

MR SATLOF
Eyes front No talking

DISSOLVE TO

LAINE TAKING HER TEST She hears whispering and looks up to
see her TEACHER out in the hall talking with someone

Mr Satlof comes back into the classroom and by his somber
expression Laine knows that something is wrong

MR SATLOF (CONTD)
I know some of you are finishing
up but I have something I need
to share with everyone

Students put their pencils down Murmuring wondering whats
going on

MR SATLOF (CONTD)
I just got word that

Mr Satlof’s voice trails off This is hard for him to say
Laine glances back again at the EMPTY DESK Then --
LAINE
It’s Debbie isn’t it What
happened
Now everyone’s looking at Laine Mr Satlof slowly nods
MR SATLOF
I’m so sorry she died at her

house last night

TREVOR
Oh my God

Reaction ripples through the classroom Isabelle starts
crying But Laine is frozen

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary
LAINE
No It’s a mistake Debbie can’t
be dead

MR SATLOF

This is a tremendous loss The
school will be providing counselors
for anyone who needs to talk during
this difficult time --

EASE IN ON LAINE Her eyes stare in shock The world
suddenly seems to swim around her Sounds and voices fading

And from that EMPTY DESK with the note sitting on it we go --
INT LAINE’S ROOM - DAY

Laine stands at a mirror as an OLDER WOMAN zips up her black
dress from behind This is Laine’s grandmother NONA

The woman sees the devastation on her granddaughter’s face
Their conversations are always in Spanish with subtitles --

NONA
I know this mourning that you feel
With the death of a friend there
is a part of you who dies as well

LAINE
Its like theres a pain in my
heart that will never go away

NONA
Respect grief my precious Elena
It is often in these times we find
our own light and understanding

Laine looks at her grandmother

LAINE
I dont want understanding I want
Debbie back

There’s a knock at the door Laine’s father ANTHONY MORENO
Latino Dressed in a suit His eyes filled with heartache

MR MORENO
It’s time

EXT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - DAY

Several cars are parked out front GUESTS in post-funeral
attire heading into the house

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - DAY

WITH LAINE Standing among the mourners who are gathered in
the house Adults Other high school friends A few
teachers Mr Satlof among them Trevor and Isabelle are
here

Laine moves through the gathering Voices hushed Snippets
of dialogue

MOURNERS (VARIOUS)
and that Carol had to find her
like that in the closet Just
horrible makes no sense
They’re packed and coming to stay
with me can’t be in this house
another night

Laine hovers glances at a vintage ANNIVERSARY CLOCK Small
crack in the glass dome Hands frozen in time Hasn’t
worked in years

Beat then over at the stairs she sees a GUY standing there
holding flowers Student Strange Thrift store suit and
tie He doesn’t seem to know anyone else here He’s just
standing there Glancing up the stairs

Laine hears crying Sees Debbie’s PARENTS sitting across the
house being comforted by friends THE MOTHER sobbing

Laine turns back and now that GUY at the bottom of the
stairs is gone His flowers left behind on the foyer table

INT DEBBIES ROOM - DAY
Upstairs Laine pushes open a door into Debbie’s bedroom

She steps inside and glances around as if trying to
understand Debbie’s sudden death

The room is decorated in an eclectic style Evidence of
Debbie’s life in high school theatre Framed posters and
photos of her plays and performances But the most prominent
feature in the room is a MURAL OF A TREE silhouette style
Painted branches sweeping across the wall

It’s familiar We’ve been in this room before

Laine casts a glance to the closet The door is slightly
open An unsettling crack of darkness within Laine reaches
out and pushes it closed

Laine takes a breath She steps to a BULLETIN BOARD covered
in mementos and photos Almost all of the pictures are of
Debbie and Laine Through the years Birthday parties
Camping trips School dances Arms around each other

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

A faint CREAK Laine looks over and the closet door is
again slightly open She stares unaware that a FIGURE is
now right behind her

MRS GALARDI (0S)
You were everything to her

Laine spins and sees Debbie’s MOTHER standing there The
woman’s eyes wild with grief

LAINE
Mrs G
(devastating beat)
I can’t believe she’s gone

Laine hugs Debbie’s mom Holds her tight in the silence
And then Mrs Galardi pulls back looks at Laine

MRS GALARDI
Do you understand this Laine Why
would my baby do this to herself
Tears run down Laine’s cheeks All of this simply too much

LAINE
I don’t know

Mrs Galardi steps away glances around Being in this
room the despair is so immense

Mrs Galardi starts collecting some of her daughter’s
possessions and putting them in a box A bracelet An old
Flip camera Pulling photos from the bulletin board

Laine watches her with concern not understanding

LAINE (CONT’D)
Mrs G

MRS GALARDI
She’d want you to have these This
way a part of her is always with
you
Mrs Galardi hands Laine the box of mementos

MRS GALARDI (CONTD)
Always remember her

Laine nods Her heart breaking
EXT LAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A very similar two-story style as Debbie’s house Same
neighborhood The sudden SOUND OF GIRLS LAUGHING takes us --

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

FLIP CAMERA VIDEO SCREEN Recent footage Laine and Debbie
trying on dresses in a small store changing room Laughing
Posing in the mirror Hamming it up for the camera

DEBBIE
Thats the one Very hot Lemme
see that booty shake

SALESPERSON (0OS)
Ladies I need you to keep it down
in there We do have other
customers

Laine and Debbie laugh so hard they can barely breathe

ANOTHER MOMENT Laine and Debbie in their dresses In
Debbies house Saying goodbye to Debbies parents

ANOTHER MOMENT School dance Music pumping Lights
swirling Debbie holds the camera out getting a two-shot of
her and Laine The kind of night you want to last forever
Image freezes A GLITCH It makes Debbies frozen laugh
look like a scream

INT LAINE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Laine’s on her bed with the box of mementos Laptop open

next to her revealing Debbie’s Facebook page -- now a
memorial Memories and messages from friends popping up

Laine tries to get the Flip camera working again but it’s
stuck on that image of Debbie Laine sets it aside

She looks down at the mementos Laine puts Debbie’s infinity
charm bracelet on her wrist She dangles a little penguin
with sunglasses keychain on her finger

when she hears a loud car MUFFLER outside

Laine goes to the window Her sister SARAH emerges from
a beat-up car that proceeds to head off down the street

The girl comes up the sidewalk as Laine’s FATHER storms out
of the house Laine cracks her bedroom window to listen --

MR MORENO
-- that’s the guy you skipped
school with today What the hell’s
going on with you

Sarah responds Her voice low Laine unable to make it out

MR MORENO (CONTD)
Well you better start caring
Because I’m getting calls at work
Principal said one more no-show and
you’re getting expelled --

Laine watches as her father follows Sarah into the house
their ARGUING VOICES muffled through the walls

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

SARAH stomps up the stairs into the hallway and we get our
first real look at her Heavy makeup Growing up too fast

Sarah sees Laine standing there

SARAH
Great Now I get to be blessed
with your opinion too Lucky me

LAINE
I can’t believe you weren’t at the
funeral Actually I can It’s
totally typical

Sarah keeps heading to her room Laine follows

SARAH
Can’t be around people crying All
sad and stuff --

LAINE
-- Debbie was always good to you
Especially when mom left --

SARAH
-- I know Okay
(beat)
And now she’s gone too

Sarah steps into her room and closes the door leaving Laine
alone in the hallway

INT LAINE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Laine steps to her bed starts putting Debbie’s things back
in the box She glances over and sees that a PHOTO has
fallen on the floor Face down She picks it up

It’s Laine and Debbie circa 7th grade The two girls are in
their pajamas playing a OUIJA BOARD

Two girls playing Ouija Weve seen this photo

Laine stares at the photo Lost in thought She notices
something Runs her finger over a GLARE streaking across the
Ouija board in the image It’s odd

Then -- LAINES COMPUTER SCREEN Photo folders Click
Recent Instagram pics of Laine and her friends

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

INT LAINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

Laine scrolls through her digital photos Going backwards
through the years And Laine finally finds the exact same
photo of her and Debbie on the floor playing the Ouija

Laine holds up the printed photo next to the image on her
screen Theres no glare on her computer version The one
from Debbies bulletin board is definitely different

CLOSE ON THE PRINTED PHOTO Suddenly lit up with a bright
FLASH OF LIGHT

Laine takes a ‘snapscan’ of the photo with her iPad She
opens up the image in her photo app and ENLARGES THE PICTURE

She scrolls around Down to the Ouija board That WEIRD
GLARE Laine taps -- blows the photo up even more The
glare seems to perfectly highlight the word GOOD BYE at the
bottom of the Ouija board

off of Laine’s puzzled expression cut to --
EXT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - DAY
Debbie’s house sits in late afternoon shadows Curtains
drawn Trevor’s car pulls up in front Laine gets out and
heads around the side of the house
LAINE
This’ll just be a second I have
to grab something

Trevor calls out through the rolled down window --

TREVOR
I thought her parents were gone

Laine doesn’t answer Keeps walking
EXT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Alone Laine moves past a tarp covered swimming pool in the
backyard She glances up at the dark windows of the house

There’s a soft lapping of water from under the pool tarp
Laine turns A brief undulating MOVEMENT underneath but
it’s just the wind Dead leaves blowing across the tarp

Laine checks under a small garden statue -- finds a SPARE
KEY A hiding place she’s familiar with

And when she looks back up at the house there’s now a
LIGHT TURNED ON IN AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW Laine looks at the
window unsettled as we go --

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - DAY

A CLICK at the back door and Laine comes inside Curtains
drawn Still

LAINE
Mrs G Hello

No answer Laine moves through the kitchen Coffee cups
next to an open tin of cookies remnants of Debbie’s wake
There’s a feeling that Debbie’s parents packed a few things
and simply left So eerie

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Laine steps to the top of the stairs Down the hall the
LIGHT is coming from Debbie’s bedroom

LAINE
Somebody there

INT DEBBIES ROOM - DAY

Laine moves into Debbie’s room Everything here is just as
it was the other day Preserved and untouched

The bedside table lamp suddenly FLICKERS off and then back
on BUZZING like it has a bad bulb Laine unplugs it

But now there’s a slight sound SCRAAAPE Laine turns --
eyes falling on the CLOSET Is it coming from in there

She goes to the closet Hesitates Knowing what happened in

here Laine opens the doors Darkness Can’t see She
reaches up pulls the light cord --

-- and there’s a FACE SOMEONE’S STANDING BEHIND THE CLEAR
PLASTIC HANGING BAGS

Laine startles as --

TREVOR (0S)
What’re you doing

Laine spins to find Trevor behind her Watching As Laine
turns back to the closet she sees that the “face” is
actually one of Debbie’s painted theatre masks hanging on
the back wall

Laine settles looks around the closet shelves And there
among some other games is a OUIJA BOARD She pulls it down
and brings it over to the floor

Laine sits there runs her fingers over the antique lettering
on the vintage wooden game board

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

TREVOR (CONTD)
So you came here looking for a
Ouija board

LAINE
We used to play all the time

TREVOR
Anything cool ever happen

LAINE
No it’s just a game But we
pretended it was real Asked
questions about our future You
know ‘Will I ever find true
love’ Stuff like that Debbie
would always spell out the answers
I needed to hear And I’d do the
same for her Like texting each
other Old school

Trevor picks up the tear-shaped PLANCHETTE out of the box
It’s wooden Looks homemade Not the plastic kind that
usually comes with the game

TREVOR
And this is the thing you use --
the game piece

LAINE
The planchette Debbie’s mom made
this one when she was our age Put
her initials on the bottom And we
added ours too See

Laine places the planchette on the board Touches it with
two fingers moving it slightly across the board --

LAINE (CONTD)
You know how Debbie and I had that
huge fight a few weeks ago

Trevor nods

LAINE (CONTD)
I thought it would blow over You

know ‘Itll be okay tomorrow’ Or
next week And suddenly theres no
tomorrow

Laine looks at Trevor She is sick with guilt

TREVOR
Laine you can’t blame yourself for
this Friends have arguments Why
Debbie did what she did we’ll
never know

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Quiet Laine keeps looking at the board

LAINE
Sit across from me a sec

Trevor gives her a look -- knows where she’s going with this

LAINE (CONTD)
You aren’t supposed to mess with it
alone

TREVOR
You said it was a game

LAINE
It is But

Trevor sits across from her Watches as Laine puts her
fingertips on the planchette He does the same

TREVOR
Okay

LAINE
You do two circles like this One
for each of us Clockwise

They move the planchette twice around the board The feeling
in the room shifts Trevor gives Laine her space knows she
needs to say some things

LAINE (CONTD)
Freshman year when my mom suddenly
decided that she needed to ‘find
herself’ and split on us I was a
total mess You get your world
ripped out from you like that -- you
don’t know if you can trust anyone

again And Deb she pulled me out
of it It wasn’t anything she said
or did -- it was her just being

there Always there

Trevor trades a quiet look with Laine moved by her words

LAINE (CONTD)
I never got to say ‘goodbye’

Together their hands move the planchette to the words GOOD
BYE at the bottom of the Ouija board Overcome with sadness
Laine can barely say the words

LAINE (CONTD)
Goodbye Debbie

INT LAINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Laine’s back home Alone in her room And she now has the
OUIJA with her She sets the board on her desk Slides the
planchette on GOOD BYE at the bottom Laine lights a votive
candle next to the board A remembrance

TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE as the candle burns low flickers
out the light in the room fading on the board

INT LAINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It’s late The room sits in darkness We’re on the Ouija
board the planchette still rests on the words GOOD BYE

DRIFT OVER TO LAINE Asleep We hover above the bed as

-very Slowly almost imperceptibly the bedside table
begins to slide away from the bed

Laine wakes up Listening in the dark as she hears something
moving in her room

Laine sits up reaches over for her lamp and it’s not
there She looks over to see that her bedside table is now
three feet away from the bed The light cord from the lamp
swings slightly

And that sound comes again SCRAAAAPE something else is
sliding around in the room

Laine gets out of bed turns on the lamp -- and the sound
immediately stops

Laine steps over to see the OUIJA BOARD on the desk where she
left it But something looks different The planchette has
moved no longer on GOOD BYE at the bottom of the board

Laine stands right over the board sees that the planchette
is now on top of the letter ‘D’

Laine is chilled by the sight of it She cautiously reaches
out and touches the planchette glances around her room --
‘what just happened’

INT LAINE’S BEDROOM - DAY

Morning Laine’s getting dressed as Sarah shuffles past in
the hallway just now waking up

LAINE
Hey Worm —-

Sarah pokes her head in

INT DINER - DAY

Local hangout Family-owned kind of place Laine sits with
Trevor and Isabelle at a booth Isabelle wears a waitress
uniform taking a break from her shift

Laine is in the middle of her story --

LAINE
-- and then the planchette had
moved to the letter ‘D

TREVOR
The board mustve gotten bumped --

LAINE
-- it did not get bumped Trevor
Stuff was moving in my room

Trevor reaches across the table takes Laine’s hands

TREVOR
Laine Everyone’s in shock But
you don’t need to keep feeling
guilty about this Last night
you were having some crazy
nightmare

Laines frustration is growing She pulls her hands away
LAINE
I wasnt asleep It’s Debbie
Shes trying to contact me

Isabelle and Trevor exchange a worried look Isabelle tries
a softer approach --

ISABELLE
Lets say she is What do you
think she wants

Laine looks at them Very serious

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

LAINE
She wants me to play the game

TREVOR
Are you being for real

Laine fights her emotions Trying not to fall apart

LAINE
You ever think that even after
someone you love has died there’s
still a way they can reach out What
if the game is real this time I
need to talk to Debbie Please Do
this with me

The COOK at the kitchen window hits the bell DING Order
up A man in a tie -- ISABELLE’S FATHER -- angrily waves at
her to get back to work

ISABELLE
Of course I’m in

Trevor nods uncomfortable about this

TREVOR

They all step further inside Isabelle turns on a lamp --

ISABELLE
This feels wrong We shouldn’t be

follows her gaze -- as the PERSON sitting on the bed now
stands steps further into the light

It’s the loner GUY who Laine saw at Debbie’s wake This is
PETE TREVOR LAINE
Who the hell are you -- -- what’re you doing up
here

Pete coolly takes them in Not ruffled in the slightest

PETE
Everyone just chill

TREVOR

PETE

LAINE
-- she never talked about a Pete

Pete regards Laine

PETE

to her

Laines stung by his comment A beat and then Pete holds up
a DVD

PETE (CONTD)

In answer to your questions I told
Debbie’s folks I’d burn a DVD of
her last performance Promised to
drop it off I didn’t know they
were already gone

(beat)
Back door was unlocked so

LAINE

room

Pete glances over at the CLOSET

PETE
Guess I wanted to see where it
happened Still can’t believe she
would do that

The room finally settles Pete connects a look with Laine

PETE (CONTD)
Your turn What’re you doing here

TREVOR
Laine you don’t have to tell him
anything
Pete’s eyes fall on the OUIJA board in Laine’s hands
PETE
That’s hers right Last couple of
weeks she talked a lot about that
game
Beat Laine can’t hide her surprise at this new info

LAINE
Did you ever play it with her

PETE
No She wanted me to Bugging me
about it and then she quit
asking Said she found another
friend to play with
Pete glances at all of their faces
PETE (CONTD)
That’s why you’re here Gonna try
to talk to Debbie
A beat and then Pete hands Laine the DVD
PETE (CONTD)
Then Ill let you guys do your
thing If you can get this to her

Pete heads out of the room
INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Pete stops as Laine approaches It’s just the two of them

LAINE (CONTD)
She really wanted you to play

Off his expression we go --

THE FLOOR Laine sets up the OUIJA BOARD Places the
camping lantern next to it Just the right amount of light

Trevor adjusts his VIDEO CAMERA on a tripod aiming it down
on the Ouija board He glances back at Pete and then comes
down next to Laine Very quiet --

TREVOR
We don’t even know this guy

Laine cuts a look at Pete He’s at Debbie’s desk browsing
through her things

LAINE
But Debbie did she wanted him to
play The more of her friends
around the board the more likely
we make contact
(beat)
You finish setting up the camera

TREVOR
Yeah We’re all ready

INT DEBBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone’s now gathered in a circle around the Ouija board
Sarah starts to touch the planchette but Laine stops her

LAINE
The rules first You can’t ever
break them For starters never
play Ouija in a graveyard

ISABELLE
Okay Obviously we’re good there

LAINE
Don’t ask for any physical signs --
it should only be questions and
answers Always end a session with
‘good bye’ And the most important
one -- do not play alone

Pete reaches a hand in The first to touch the planchette
He’s ready Hesitant vibe in the room --

OVERHEAD THE BOARD As everyone else puts a hand on the
planchette Fingertips touching

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

LAINE (CONTD)
We circle the board five times to
begin Once for each of us

The planchette circles the board five times clockwise then
comes to rest at the center

Laine takes a breath her words are like a summoning The
painted tree limbs of Debbie’s wall mural stretched out
behind her

LAINE (CONTD)
As friends we’ve gathered hearts
are true Spirits near we call to
you

(beat
If there is a presence here please
make yourself known

Nothing happens The planchette is totally still Isabelle
and Trevor trade a side glance just wanting this to be over

Laine remains focused on the board asks again --

LAINE (CONTD)
Is there a presence among us

Another long moment passes And then

PETE
I feel something

TREVOR
Feel what Nothing’s happening

We ever so slightly PUSH IN ON THE BOARD -- and the
planchette starts moving Slowly at first The movement is
stuttered tentative But definitely moving

SARAH
C’mon Who’s doing that

ISABELLE
Not me

The planchette keeps moving into the upper left hand corner
of the board stopping on the word YES

PETE
Can you tell us who you are

Beat then the planchette slides over to the ‘D’ Laine’s
eyes widen She’s breathless

LAINE
It’s her I told you I told you

LAINE (CONTD)
(out into the room)
Debbie talk to us

With eerie movement the planchette LITERALLY STARTS TO TURN
UNDERNEATH THE PLAYERS’ FINGERS Like it’s pointing in a
direction then moves with a sudden quickness to the letter
‘H’ now over to ‘I’

LAINE (CONTD)
She’s spelling something

EVERYONE WATCHES their faces bathed in the cool blue LED
light of the camping lantern as --

-- the planchette glides across the board More letters
Each one coming faster F-R-E

(Visual note we won’t show every letter when the Ouija is
spelling out messages The game sessions will always be a
combination of fast stylistic shots of seeing certain letters
appear in the planchette window and characters talking out
the messages as they happen)

VIDEO CAMERA FOOTAGE That fixed angle on the tripod
Looking down at the circle of players hands on the
Pplanchette as the game piece moves uncannily again to the
letter ‘D’ And stays there Finished with the message
Everyones fingertips remaining on the planchette Sarah is
fully engaged now --

SARAH
It spelled ‘hi friend’

ON LAINE -- astonishment filling her eyes

LAINE
Hi friend

Isabelle and Trevor trade that worried look again Isabelle
asks a question pretending that she believes in this --

ISABELLE
Laine thinks you’re trying to make
contact
Nothing happens
LAINE
Have you been in my room -- was

that you last night
The planchette TWITCHES then slowly slides again to YES
LAINE (CONTD)

Is there something youre trying to
tell me

The planchette TWITCHES again under their fingers moves to
‘07

the number ‘3’ now over to another number --
Pete watches -- trying to follow it all
PETE
It’s a number ‘306’

NOW LETTERS the planchette criss-crossing the board and
then coming to a stop

ISABELLE
And ‘BD Y’

SARAH
What does that mean ‘Body’ Or
initials Somebody you know

Laine shakes her head

LAINE

Trevor sees the hope in his girlfriend’s eyes It’s killing
him

TREVOR
Okay I think we’re done here --

LAINE
-- No We can’t stop Not now

VIDEO CAMERA FOOTAGE Trevor looks up into the lens with
his free hand uses his remote to widen out the angle on the
room We stay in VIDEO CAMERA MODE --

around to see that everyone’s on their feet Rattled
But Laine’s not with the group

TREVOR (O0S) (CONTD)

The camera eventually finds Laine out in the upstairs
hall Standing there very still

TREVOR (O0S) (CONTD)

Trevor takes the lantern from Sarah moves out in front of
the others with the light

-the lantern light pushes into the shadows ahead Past
framed photos of Debbie hanging on the staircase wall The
further we go the more distinct that MUSIC becomes A
delicate and haunting melody

Trevor arrives DOWNSTAIRS catching his reflection ina
hanging wall mirror Across the room we see Laine standing
next to the VINTAGE ANNIVERSARY CLOCK Mechanisms turn
inside the glass dome as the MUSIC plays

Trevor approaches Laine She keeps staring at the clock

LAINE
This was broken since we were

And then the MUSIC winds down stops Laine looks away
from the clock talking out into the downstairs Urgent

Moment It bobbles Finally re-adjusts and now were

the camera screen)

Around a corner Theres Pete in a downstairs hallway
Blood on his shirt He looks stunned

LAINE
Can I hang on to this I want to
go through the footage Take

Trevor doesn’t say anything Laine looks up at him and sees
his expression Hard to read

LAINE (CONTD)
Why are you looking at me like
that

TREVOR
I’m worried about you That you
need this game to mean something

LAINE
You were there You saw what
happened tonight

TREVOR
Yeah And that guy Pete was there
too I don’t know what he’s up to
but he’s messing around with your
head You believe that he saw
someone in the house the mirror

LAINE
His hand Why would he do that to
himself

Trevor shrugs gazes off

TREVOR
I mean we really dont know what
he was doing there tonight Do we

Laine turns Sees Pete standing there behind the bleachers
He approaches Laine glances at his bandaged hand Its
awkward between them

LAINE
Hows your hand

PETE
Better Thanks

Pete stands there Uneasy

PETE (CONTD)
Last night with the game What
do you think really happened

Laine doesnt say anything Cautious Pete keeps going

PETE (CONTD)

Because I was reading these
theories about the Ouija One of
them said it’s our subconscious
minds moving the planchette You
know Involuntary motor muscles
kick in and were just telling
ourselves what we want to believe

(beat)
There are only two things it can
be Either our minds are playing
tricks on us or we were really
talking to Debbie last night

Laine regards Pete and then she breaks Putting her true
feelings out there

LAINE
Yeah I believe it was her

Pete quietly nods turns away Like hes trying to hold
back his emotions

LAINE (CONTD)
Did you like her You know more
than friends

PETE
We hung out in class She always
said I was a good listener Yeah
I thought maybe there could be more
between us That I should ask her
out But I never did

at Laine Linger here for a moment then --

WITH LAINE -- as she checks things out A messy math BINDER
Graded papers in folders A couple cans of Red Bull

LAINE (CONTD)
What do you want me to find

Laine keeps digging Pushes aside a sweater in the back of
the locker to find a black and white marbled NOTEBOOK

Notebook pages flip to reveal doodles to-do lists
math scratch paper Nothing of significance Laine keeps
flipping

-suddenly stops on a detailed sketch of a OUIJA BOARD And
as Laine slowly turns the page there’s more VINTAGE PHOTO
COLLAGES of people playing Ouija Eerie images printed from
the internet that depict seance type gatherings and spirit
contact This wasn’t done in the name of art It feels like
the outward signs of an increasing obsession

JOURNAL ENTRIES and dates are mixed in with the images
Debbie’s handwriting Laine reads a passage quietly to
herself as her face fills with deep concern

MANS VOICE
Laine what are you doing

Laine turns and sees the history teacher MR SATLOF
standing at the end of the hall watching her intently

LAINE
Nothing

Laine closes the locker shutting us back into the DARKNESS

it blank

TREVOR
That was her last entry written
the day she died
(to Laine)
And you’re sure she never says a
name of who she’s playing with

LAINE
No Like she was keeping a secret

Isabelle swallows
ISABELLE
What if Debbie wasn’t alone that
night

They all absorb the impact of this

TREVOR
That Pete guy Maybe he was with
her --

LAINE

-- we don’t know that

ISABELLE
I got an idea How about we just
walk away from all of this

Nona retrieves the other sock at the top of the stars and as
she looks down the hall

like a trail leading to Laine’s closed bedroom door

Nona feels a chill She puts the basket down moves down the
hall stopping at Laine’s door

She hesitates at the door then pushes it open
INT LAINE’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nona steps into Laine’s room and sees that the trail of
clothes continues across her floor to the bed

UNDER THE BED as NONA comes closer Picking up the
clothes Closer

BACK WITH NONA She gets down on her hands and knees starts
to lift the dust ruffle when behind her -- a SCRAPING SOUND

Nona turns Just as the Ouija planchette falls off the desk
and lands on the floor She picks it up Confused And as
she stands she sees the OUIJA BOARD on the desk In an
instant she realizes what she’s holding and drops it

Backing away from the board right into -- Laine Home from
school Both of them scaring the hell out of each other

LAINE
Nona what’re you doing --
Nona points at the Ouija board but won’t look at it
NONA

-- you should never touch such
things let alone bring one into
your house --

game Thats all Nona --

Bike gears clickclickclick as Trevor makes his way through
the narrow tunnel light fading on him as he goes deeper

Up ahead a sound coming from around a tunnel corner
-SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH

Trevor stops Silencing the clicking of his bike so he can
hear better

The SCRATCHING gets louder like nails on a chalkboard
echoing in this concrete corridor

TREVOR
Hey -- somebody there

No answer but something MOVES An abandoned SHOPPING CART
slowly rolls out from behind the corner drifts to a stop

Trevor peers ahead into the darkness Can’t see around the
corner up ahead Was it the wind or did someone push it

TREVOR (CONTD)
Who is that

The cart just sits there Trevor leans his bike against the
wall and unclips a safety light from under the seat He
starts walking toward that corner Coiled On edge His
red light BLINKING into the darkness

TREVOR (CONTD)
Pete I swear to god dude --

He quickly rounds the corner -- andno one’s there Trevor
regards the empty tunnel his light still blinking when
suddenly -- a small ROCK comes skipping out of the darkness

landing at his feet Like someone just tossed it

Trevor picks up the rock Rattled He moves toward the
direction it came from notices a sign on the tunnel wall

PLAYGROUND -- with an arrow pointing to the exit Trevor
runs his light across the sign revealing that it’s been
vandalized Some of the letters wildly scratched off

Just the word PLAY remains

ahead of him where the rock came skittering in from He
starts to back away unaware that in the brief flashes of
red light --

backing up right toward them Closer CLOSER He turns --

Laine hesitates Then --

LAINE
It was just once

Nona touches the small gold cross that dangles from her neck

Promise Elena You get rid of it
Never touch it again

Nona’s warning hangs heavy in the air

A chill runs through Laine as she looks up at the window
But it’s empty

I told Mr G I’d wait with you here

Who knocked the camera over

Laine stops the tape Silencing the chaotic volume of the
game REWIND Everything moving in reverse She hits PLAY
again watching an earlier moment The argument --

ISABELLE
Laine said no physical sign

SARAH
So what I dont see anyone taking
their hand away

Laine FREEZES the tape REWINDS further and REPLAYS
Watching the game as the planchette moves about the board

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Specifically she’s watching Pete Closely Trying to get a
read on his facial expressions

Now studying his hand as the planchette spells out a message --
starting to wonder if he is making it move

She hits pause The image freezes between frames It
creates a weird effect and it makes Pete look strange
His features suddenly menacing

Out in the hall a floorboard CREAKS Similar to the sound
Laine just heard on the video playback

LAINE
Sarah

INT LAINE’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Laine comes down the hall So irritated She opens Sarah’s
bedroom door

LAINE
Worm if you’re sneaking out --
But Sarah’s not in her room Beat Laine continues down
the hall to THE STAIRS -- and finds Sarah standing a few

steps below quietly staring ahead

From the top of the stairs Laine can see that the front door
is wide open lightly THUMPING against the wall leaves
blowing in across the foyer from the outside

Sarah slowly turns back looking up at Laine Quiet --

SARAH
Someone’s in the house

They hold a rising terrified look as the sound of something
heavy suddenly SCRAPES on the floor downstairs Like someone
accidentally bumped into a piece furniture in the dark

Sarah bolts back up the stairs to Laine -- and together they
hurry into --

INT LAINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Laine silently pulls at Sarah over to the closet A hiding
spot The two girls moving quickly -- quietly slipping into
the closet Closing the door

INT CLOSET - NIGHT

Very dark in here Laine and Sarah huddle close in the small
closet Voices so quiet and scared ---

SARAH
Ohmygodohmygod

LAINE
Shh-shh Do you have your phone
Good Call for help

SARAH
Who the hell’s in our house

LAINE
Just call --

Their faces visible in the faint glow of Sarahs cell phone
THUD A sound out in the house

LAINE (CONTD)
Sarah -- hurry

SARAH
I’m trying

Sarah cant even dial her phone Hands shaking so bad

And now something SLAMS against the closet door Hands over
their mouths the girls want to cry out -- but cant Takes
everything they have to hold it in

Another SLAM against the closet door Sarah drops her phone

Laine grabs the closet door handle Holds it tight Trying
to keep anyone from getting it open

It’s an excruciating moment Waiting for what’s next
Breathing hard Scared to death

And then ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE on the other side of the door
It sounds like someone’s banging on the door with their
fists BAM BAM BAM Over and over and over Relentless
The CLOSET DOOR RATTLES HARD -- someone’s trying to get in

Sarah cant even hold back anymore She SCREAMS Falling
back into the corner of the closet

Laine holds tight -- with everything she’s got BAM BAM
BAM Louder LOUDER SO GODDAMN LOUD And then --

-- it stops Completely All the noise Silent

The longest beat the girls hold absolutely still And
then Laine gently turns the door handle

SARAH (CONT’D)
Dont

Laine does it anyway Opens the door

INT LAINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

The girls emerge from the closet And even in the dark
right away -- they can tell that something’s different

SARAH
Where’s your bed

LAINE
Moved Over there

SARAH
Everything’s moved

The whole room has been rearranged But there’s a
familiarity about the lay-out of all the furniture Car
lights pass by outside just for a moment -- casting a long
tree branch shadow across the wall

Laine feels for a light -- CLICK
It’s now set up just like Debbie’s room Bed Desk Side

table Even the OUIJA BOARD is at the center of the floor
just like when they play it at Debbie’s house

Sarah takes it all in reeling

SARAH (CONT’D)
This is so messed up who would
do this

Laine kneels down next to the Ouija board on the floor and
sees that the planchette is once again on the letter ‘D’

LAINE
It’s Debbie She wants us to play
again

INT DINER - DAY

Corner booth Away from the other customers Everyone who
played the Ouija is gathered Except for Pete Voices
hushed Urgent Talking over each other --

LAINE
-- and all the furniture had been
moved Arranged just like Debbie’s
room The game sitting right
there It was her way of saying we
need to come back to the board --

TREVOR
-- Laine Stop it This isa
living breathing person who’s
trying to freak us out The game
is not real

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

ISABELLE
Then how do you explain someone
watching me last night writing
messages on my car --

TREVOR
-- it’s Pete You ever wonder if
the guy might be a complete
psycho making us think that its
Debbie doing all this I mean
what do you want me to say here

LAINE
I want you to say you believe in
this

But Trevor won’t give her that

Sarah has remained silent this whole time Still shaken by
the night before She finally speaks her voice quiet

SARAH
In our house last night couldnt
have been a person that did all
that It was her I’m with Laine
We’ve got to keep going

Isabelle looks at Laine Puts it out there --
ISABELLE
You think shes trying to tell us
the truth about how she died
Laine holds her look Its dead quiet

LAINE
Someone killed Debbie

ISABELLE
Why did we do this Never should
have touched that thing

LAINE
We have to talk to her We get a
name and then we’re done

No one says anything Just an incredible sense of dread in
the air And then jolting us like a clap of thunder --

THE OUIJA BOARD Larger than life FOUR HANDS reach in
fingertips touching the planchette

INT DEBBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT
Laine Trevor Sarah and Isabelle sit on the floor in

Debbie’s room A couple of battery lanterns placed about the
dark room Everyone has a hand on the planchette

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

LAINE
Four circles this time One for
each of us

They CIRCLE THE BOARD clockwise One Two Three Four
The game has begun

LAINE (CONTD)
As friends we’ve gathered hearts

you If there’s a presence here
make yourself known

Long beat on the board the planchette totally still

SARAH
It’s not working

ISABELLE
Let me try Debbie it’s Iz Will

Everybody remains intensely focused Barely breathing EASE
IN on the planchette Closer and closer a feeling of
passing time

and nothing happens It sits there Lifeless

SARAH
I don’t understand

ISABELLE
We’re doing everything exactly the
same

LAINE
Not everything
(beat)
Pete’s not here Maybe because
there were five of us who made
initial contact something about
our collective energy

Beat as Trevor gives Laine a look

TREVOR
Collective energy Sure That’s
it You know what There’s one
way to find out

ISABELLE
Bring Pete here -- what if it’s him
doing all this

TREVOR

It’s okay Iz Laine go ahead
Invite him over

TIME DISSOLVE FROM THE SHINING LIGHT OF THE CAMPING
LANTERN we drift up to see that PETE is now sitting with the
others in the circle around the board He feels the tension
No one’s talking to him

PETE
So what’s going on with this little
gathering Seems like the party
got started without me You guys
tried to play already didn’t you

TREVOR
We’re going to do something
different this time Pete

Trevor has a bandana in his hand Pete eyes it

PETE
Blackout Okay so we’re all
taking turns or it’s just for
me

LAINE
For you

TREVOR
Unless you don’t want to stay

Pete thinks about it --

PETE
Fine Go ahead

Trevor comes behind Pete Ties the blindfold over his eyes
Cinches it tight Pete’s eyes are completely covered No
way he can see the board

Before they start Trevor quietly TURNS THE BOARD 180
DEGREES It’s now upside down for Pete and he’s unaware

TREVOR
Okay Pete We’re starting

The four friends reach in and put their hand on the
planchette Pete blindly feels out and touches the
lanchette with his bandaged hand He’s the last one in

Pp
Quiet beat on the Ouija
T
s

hen a TWITCH of the planchette IT MOVES Like before
lides across the board to the letter D”

Laine and the others silently take note then a suspicious
glance at Pete with his blindfold Laine turns her eyes back
to the board

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

LAINE
Debbie we want to help you Who
were you playing with Who was
with you the night you died

The planchette slightly vibrates under their fingers THEN
QUICKLY SLIDES ALL THE WAY OFF THE BOARD

SARAH
Whoa What does that mean

TREVOR
Because he can’t see So he’s just
sliding it off the board --

PETE
-- I didn’t do that --

LAINE
-- Trevor Stop

Laine moves the planchette back onto the board

LAINE (CONTD)
Give us a name Who were you with

The planchette just sits there Everyone staring Laine
takes a breath tries a new approach

LAINE (CONTD)
If you don’t want to say right now
I understand How about something
else Just so we know it’s you
The planchette remains still
LAINE (CONTD)
The other night you moved
everything around in my room
A beat and then the planchette slides to YES

Laine exchanges a look with her little sister Sees the fear
on her face

LAINE (CONTD)
You really scared Sarah Lets not
do that anymore
The planchette starts to move H-A-H-A

SARAH
‘Ha ha’

Laine suddenly doesn’t feel right about this game Something
is off

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

LAINE
Debbie The clock downstairs
remember how it got broken

The planchette just sits there

LAINE (CONTD)
-when we were kids

TREVOR
(under his breath)
What’re you doing

Laine doesn’t answer Focused on the board

LAINE
Who broke the clock

The planchette hesitates Then spells M-E
Laine looks up at the others --

LAINE (CONTD)
I was the one who broke the clock
It’s not her
(beat)
This isn’t Debbie

SUDDENLY WE’RE ACROSS THE ROOM Watching the players from a
lurking perspective Behind Debbie’s bedside table The
lantern right in front of us moves Just an inch The players
don’t notice focused on the game The lantern moves again
Slowly sliding It inches across the table and --

-- CRASH Everyone spins at the sudden sound and sees the
fallen lamp on the floor

PETE
What the hell was that

Trevor in particular seems alarmed by the incident He turns
back to look at the blindfolded Pete suddenly not so sure
of his beliefs anymore

Laine turns back to the planchette The air feels thick She
asks in a cautious tone --

LAINE
Who is this

Like before the planchette slides to D stops for a
moment and then keeps going Over to Z

LAINE (CONTD)

DZ We dont know you We want
to talk to Debbie

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

QUICK MOVEMENTS ACROSS THE BOARD Letters appear in the
planchette window 2 BAD

ISABELLE
‘Too bad’

LAINE
Did Debbie make contact with you

The board spells out -- M-Y-F-R-E-N-D

TREVOR
My friend

A sick realization sets into Trevor’s expression
TREVOR (CONTD)

Wait Is this who Debbie was
talking about This is the friend

EASE IN ON LAINE a rising sense of urgency in her question
amidst the revelations --

LAINE
When the five of us played
before that was you

Planchette slides to YES

MOVE AROUND THE CIRCLE OF PLAYERS A beat on each of their
faces now connected to this game more than ever

LAINE (CONTD)
And the night Debbie died she
was playing the game She was
talking to you

CLOSE ON THE PLANCHETTE Totally still and then it starts
to VIBRATE HARD Literally RATTLING against the board

Everyone stares keeping their fingers in place This is
something new Pete sits there with his blindfold in place
Getting tense at only being able to hear

LAINE (CONTD)
Did you kill her

The lights from the surrounding lanterns begin to BRIGHTEN
A LOW GROANING SOUND coming from somewhere deep in the house

Pete rips the blindfold off Can’t take it anymore
Desperate to see what’s going on

Isabelle closes her eyes saying a prayer to herself

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

ISABELLE
Please forgive us for what we have
done

But Laine keeps pressing Has to know the truth

LAINE
Did you kill Debbie

The planchette shoots over to YES

The LIGHTS BRIGHTEN EVEN MORE on everyone’s stunned faces
That INHUMAN GROANING SOUND IN THE HOUSE coming from all
directions

LAINE (CONTD)
What do you want Tell us

The planchette zig-zags from letter to letter around the
board A new message -- FNSHGME

LAINE (CONTD)
Debbie had the same message in her
journal I don’t know what it
means --

Pete looks sick because he figures it out --

PETE
Finish game

Those two simple words said out loud -- and the game feels
more ominous than ever The players squint against the
impossible bright light The planchette RATTLING LIKE HELL
UNDER THEIR FINGERS

Isabelle is the first to bail She yanks her hand away and
scrambles back from the board

All of them now pull their hands away backing away as
blinding light fills the room Laine’s the last one at the
board She pulls her hand away --

-- AND THE PLANCHETTE IS STILL MOVING BY ITSELF It’s like
a living thing twitching on the floor

SARAH
Laine -- get away from it

But she can’t pull herself away shouting at the Ouija board --
LAINE

We’re done Do you hear me We’re
not playing the game anymore

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

She watches as the planchette skitters to the bottom of the
board and then SLOWLY GRINDS across the words that are
printed there WE HOLD VERY CLOSE AS IT MOVES LETTER TO
LETTER

GOOD BYE

Laine stares as the overhead light suddenly comes on
Growing brighter along with the other lights BLINDING It
pops Glass showering down

Pete pulls Laine away from the falling glass Both of them
now safely against the wall

Lantern bulbs suddenly POP AND BREAK -- the entire BEDROOM
falling into PITCH DARKNESS We hear the commotion of
everyone screaming in panic HARD CUT TO --

EXT EMPTY LOT - NIGHT

At the edge of the neighborhood a dark vacant lot In the
distance THE GROUP stands around a small fire

CLOSER WITH THEM Some newspaper and a few dry branches
burn Orange light flickers on everyone’s haunted faces

ISABELLE
What was that --

The fire crackles No one else says anything Too rattled
Trevor has a little flask out Coiled tight as he takes a
sip But Isabelle has to talk this out loud processing --

ISABELLE (CONTD)
I mean Debbie made contact with
something evil You could feel it
right Like it was all over your
skin

LAINE
Iz it’s okay --

ISABELLE
-- it’s not okay Because when she
played she opened the wrong door or
something The game was just
sitting there -- waiting for us

SARAH
Please Stop Talking

But Isabelle is lost in her own thoughts In tears now
Words tumbling out --

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

ISABELLE
-- and then we touched it We’re
all connected now to whatever the
hell it is It got Debbie and now
it’s going to get us --

SARAH
-- shut up Just shut up

PETE
No It’s over

Everyone looks over at Pete -- as he tosses the OUIJA BOARD
on top of the fire The board starts to catch curling at
the edges

PETE (CONTD)
The board’s gone

The OUIJA BOARD is now fully consumed by the fire The words
GOOD BYE blister and bubble in the heat

Isabelle wipes her eyes trying to come down

Sarah stands next to her big sister as Laine pokes at the
burning OUIJA BOARD with a stick

Silent Trevor takes another sip from his flask gazing into
the flames

The fire pops Pete stares up watching the orange sparks
as they float into the night sky

DISSOLVE TO
EXT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Beginning of the day Cars pulling in the school lot

Sarah Laine and Isabelle walk toward the school Silent
No one’s in the mood to talk

Trevor locks his bike to the rack Sees Laine approaching
but he heads off Won’t even look at her Something’s
forever changed between them

INT HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Laine eats by herself She looks off her eyes catch --

PETE Sitting a few tables away with a couple others of his
“type” He happens to glance over -- sees Laine

He gives her a slight wave But it’s tinged with some
sadness Everyone back to their usual high school roles

Laine returns the wave But she feels the distance too

Pete watches for a moment students passing in front of his
view as he goes back to his lunch

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY
The sun starts to fade on Laine and Sarah’s house
INT LAINE AND SARAH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Laine comes down the stairs rounds the corner and stops
Visibly surprised by something

REVEAL -- Sarah in the kitchen cooking dinner She’s even

Off Laine’s reaction --
SARAH
No big deal I’ve made dinner

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT - LATER

LAINE
This fish is good

SARAH

Sarah glances at Laine and they laugh A beat

SARAH (CONTD)

Laine nods Knows not to lecture
SARAH (CONTD)

INT LAINE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Laine’s at her desk Lingering on the black and white photo
of her Debbie She glances over notices the little
keychain figure Sees that the penguin’s head is coming
loose from the body

Laine pulls on the head It comes off to reveal the
keychain toy is actually a FLASH DRIVE

Laine now has Debbie’s FLASH DRIVE plugged into her computer
She clicks through folders Searching Opens up a folder
called LET’S PLAY that contains various VIDEO FILES

Beat Laine clicks and opens up the first file Before we
see the image we hear familiar words --

ON SCREEN LAPTOP CAM POV We recognize the tree mural of
Debbies room

Laine sits with Debbie on the bed Hanging out They have
the Ouija board between them The footage feels very recent

DEBBIE
Is Blake ever going to actually ask

sending me naughty texts

Both girls have their hands on the planchette It starts to
move -- jerky

LAINE
Okay Youre being a spaz

Debbie hesitates Then visibly pushes the planchette to YES
Laine takes her hands off the planchette

LAINE (CONTD)

ON LAINE AS SHE WATCHES Reliving this moment The regret
playing across her face as we hear the argument on the video
escalating Their voices getting louder

BACK ON THE VIDEO -- Laine gets up Feeling totally
abandoned by Debbie

back onto her bed Upset

She regards the board positions it in front of her Puts
her fingertips on the planchette Talking to herself

Question Is Laine going to keep
acting like such a little bitch

answer Not in a way that looks like Debbie moving it but

camera Frame adjusting The sound of something moving in
her room

DEBBIE (CONTD)
Somethings moving what is that --

A LOUD SCRAPE Heavy across the floor Debbie turns on her
lamp catching the last bit of movement as a chair in her
room slides by itself against the door Hold All we hear
is Debbies BREATHING

ANOTHER CLIP Debbie stands in her BATHROOM MIRROR holding
the camera in one hand pulling her shirt off her shoulder
with the other Theres some kind of DARK MARK coming up
over the top of her shoulder

She keeps the camera aimed at the mirror turns around so she
can see her back and theres a much LARGER MARK across her
shoulder blade Like something smeared on her skin

DEBBIE (CONTD)

Debbie wipes at it with her hand It comes off on her
fingers a dark ash-like substance

ANOTHER CLIP DEBBIE IS BACK AT THE OUIJA BOARD

DEBBIE (CONTD)

Let’s start a new game How does

DEBBIE (CONTD)
It was fun for a while when we
first started playing But I
feel like youve changed

slowly SCRAPES across the letters (just like it did in

LAINE KEEPS WATCHING horrified by Debbie’s rising fear

Debbie gets up from the Ouija board and walks out of frame
HOLD HERE The sound of Debbie opening her bedroom door
Footsteps heading down the hall Everything very still --

-- but in the background a glass of water begins to eerily
slide across Debbies desk Image GLITCHES then shuts off

Laine sits there staring at the blank screen A SOUND She
slowly glances over a GLASS OF WATER on her own desk

Beat And then it slides Just like on the video Coming
toward her Smooth and steady Stops right in front of her

Then nothing Silence And then --
-- HER WHOLE ROOM ERUPTS THINGS HURLING OFF THE SHELVES

So sudden and intense Her laptop goes sliding across the
desk and FLIES INTO THE WALL

Laine SCREAMS Jumps to her feet as Sarah rushes into the
room Breathless

Sarah takes in the destruction with terror in her eyes She
and Laine trade a sick look

customers leave

Isabelle has the restaurant phone against her ear as she
closes out the register

ISABELLE
--yeah Dad I got it I know to

She hangs up Goes over to the wall and turns out a bank of
lights The restaurant FALLING DARK

Isabelle gathers her purse from the counter pulling keys out
when she suddenly STARTLES -- because SOMEONE has been
sitting in the far corner booth this whole time Back
turned In the shadows

Isabelle calls out --

ISABELLE (CONTD)
Excuse me but were closing up

THE FIGURE doesn’t move Doesn’t speak From the shadows
all we can see are two little glints where the eyes would be
Isabelle is suddenly weak with fear

ISABELLE (CONTD)
Did you hear me We’re closed

But THE FIGURE -- just sits there

Isabelle moves cautiously -- grabs a knife from the counter
and hits the lights BAM

No one is there Booth empty

Isabelle scans the restaurant -- but she’s alone She sets
the knife down Keys jingle in her hand Ready to get out
of here She moves for the door and stops

She stands at the daily special board Frozen The letters
have been rearranged spelling out

takes a photo of the FNISH GAME message as if to prove to
herself that this is really happening
INT ISABELLE’S CAR - NIGHT
Isabelle pulls her door closed Freaked out She glances in
the rear-view and notices something on her neck Tilts the
mirror down for a better look --
-- to see a DARK MARK across her neck similar to what we
saw on the video of Debbie standing at her bathroom mirror
Five long steaks down her skin a larger smudge at the
bottom It looks like a strange HANDPRINT

Isabelle stares Touches it Black residue comes off on her
fingers Panic surging

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Isabelle’s car speeds down the deserted late night streets

She reaches for the phone just as the light turns red She
hits the brakes and the cell phone sliiides off the seat --
slipping into the darkness underneath the passenger seat

ISABELLE
Shit

EXT INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Isabelle is the only car at the intersection Engine
idles red traffic light bleeding through the night haze

INT ISABELLE’S CAR - NIGHT

Isabelle puts the car in PARK The phone keeps RINGING as

she leans over feeling around under the seat for it
And while she’s down we notice a light pole outside the
car slowing starts MOVING As if somehow -- impossibly --

the rest of the world is sliding past the stationary car

The pole keeps moving out of view

Isabelle finally finds her phone sits up -- and something
doesn’t feel right She looks out her window to see --

-- THAT HER CAR NOW SITS SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
INTERSECTION Moved here without her even feeling it

ISABELLE
What the

And as she turns back to the front Isabelle sees something
written in the condensation on the windshield --

HI FREND

Totally frantic Isabelle turns Looking out every window
into the empty intersection Who the hell did that

She hits the windshield wipers desperate to get rid of that
finger written message The wipers squeeak back and forth
against the glass -- but the letters remain

Isabelle reaches out and runs her hand across the words and
to her horror it wipes away

It was written on the inside of the car

Her eyes shoot to the rear-view mirror Checking the back
Nobody there Just her coat laid across the back seat

but something starts to move under her coat

Isabelle keeps her eyes glued to the mirror Doesn’t dare
turn around She keeps watching in disbelief and horror as a
FIGURE takes form under her coat

Isabelle FUMBLES with the door but she can’t get out Stuck
in the car She shoots another glance to the rear-view --

-- as a HEAD emerges from under the coat Can’t see a face
Just a dark awful shape

Isabelle struggles with her door SCREAMING Unaware that
lights are rising on her from the opposite direction A fast
approaching BLARE OF A HORN

Isabelle turns -- squints into the BLINDING LIGHT --

-- SMASH Her car is literally SWEPT OUT OF FRAME We hold
forever on the sudden empty space of the intersection as
the night falls quiet again

INT LAINE’S CAR - NIGHT

Laine and Sarah drive Urgent Sarah’s on the cell phone

SARAH
Trevor’s not answering

LAINE
Isabelle’s probably still closing
up -- I already texted her When
we get there we’ll try everyone

again

FLASHING LIGHTS slowly rise across their faces Laine brings
the car to a stop Both sisters looking out the windshield

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Laine’s out of the car Sarah close behind Laine starts to
hurry toward the red spinning lights Remnants of the
accident coming into view Broken glass on the road
EMERGENCY VEHICLES Isabelle’s SMASHED CAR Laine moves
faster and now sees --

-- a SHEET COVERED BODY on a stretcher loaded into the
back of an ambulance

Laine stops in her tracks Shattered

LAINE
No no this isn’t happening

Laine staggers back from the scene Sarah stands on the
road crying Beside herself

Laine can barely breathe Slowly spinning Wishing
something could make sense to her right now

There’s a BUZZING sound in the tall grass on the side of the
road Something glowing

Numb Laine walks toward it Reaches down into the
grass and finds Isabelle’S CELL PHONE Flung from the
vehicle during the accident

A smear of blood across the screen 1 MISSED TEXT - LAINE
Laine starts going through the phone Anything that can help
her find out what happened She looks at the recent PHOTOS
Scrolls through them Fun shots Lots of pics of Isabelle
and Laine being silly Then Laine stops

It’s the photo of the MENU BOARD at the restaurant the
message from earlier that night --

LAINE (CONTD)
Finish game

PULL UP FROM LAINE AND SARAH ON THE ROAD the red lights
sweeping across them with a creeping menace and we go --

BLURRY PIXELS OF LIGHT VOICES PULLING BACK -- we see that
it’s the VIDEO of Laine and Debbie playing the Ouija in
Debbie’s room

INT LAINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Very late Laine sits at her computer Watching the
footage Still numb from Isabelle’s death

ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN --

DEBBIE
Is Blake ever going to actually ask
me out -- or will he just keep

sending me naughty texts

Both girls have their hands on the planchette It starts to
move -- jerky

LAINE
Okay Youre being a spaz

DEBBIE
Thats not me --

LAINE
-- Yeah right

Laine stops Rewinds Watches that moment again The JERKY
FAMILIAR MOVEMENT OF THE PLANCHETTE She rewinds again
Playing those few seconds over Watching closely It’s
clear now that Debbie’s not moving the planchette

There’s a STRANGE BLUR on the screen Laine enlarges the
video image on her computer CLOSER There’s Laine’s hand
Debbie’s hand -- and a THIRD GHOSTLY HAND also visible
Touching the planchette

Laine freezes the image thunderstruck by this new
understanding

This was the actual first moment of contact with the
spirit and she was part of it

INT NONAS APARTMENT - DAY
Early morning Laine and Nona sit across from each other
NONA
This is about the talking board

the one that was in your room

LAINE
Yes

NONA
What have you done

LAINE
Something very bad I didnt
listen to you

NONA
And Sarah shes part of this as
well
Laine nods -- ‘yes both of us

Nona takes a heavy breath Her words come carefully --

NONA (CONTD)
Most of us -- our spirits -- move
on when we die But for some they
remain very close to this world
If one of the living decides in
their heart to reach out and find
someone on the other side a
connection can be made to that
place But to use such means can
be a danger You may knock but it
is uncertain who will answer
There are some spirits trapped in a
place of darkness and anger
forever seeking a way back into our
world It is possible that this
entity you have been speaking with
is someone who was evil in life
and now evil in the afterlife

Its almost too much for Laine to take in

LAINE
What can I do

Beat Nona reaches out and takes Laines hands

NONA
Walk backwards in your footsteps --
to the beginning There you can
return things to where they were

You have opened a door to this
other side now you must close it

Front of the school The flag sits at half-mast against a
gray morning sky

INT HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

At Isabelle’s locker A BUNCH OF STUDENTS have gathered
Many flowers placed in the hallway Notes taped to the
locker The air heavy with the grief and shock of the death
of another student

Laine and Sarah approach Trevors already there He seems
lost in his shock unraveling Laine steps close to Trevor
Just for him to hear --

LAINE

-- I was going back through a video
of me and Debbie with the Ouija I
had no idea that all of this
started when Debbie and I played
together that last time

(beat)
I’m going to fix this Trevor

Trevor stares at her for a long moment His eyes unreadable
Laine pulls out Isabelle’S PHONE shows Trevor the ‘FNISH
GAME’ photo

LAINE (CONTD)
That message ‘Finish game’
Debbie got it too She never
figured out how to end it But we
can And then this is over

You made us play

Trevor’s tone is so cold

This DZ kills Debbie -- kills
Isabelle Its coming for all of
us --

LAINE

-- we can stop it
Trevor suddenly explodes

TREVOR
You think you can do something
There’s nothing Nothing we can do
to stop it

STUDENTS turn Now watching Laine and Trevor Not
understanding Pete approaches trying to ease the situation

PETE
Whoa -- Trevor Calm down

Suddenly Trevor PUNCHES Pete and slams him against the
lockers Laine and Sarah SCREAM OUT in shock

TREVOR
So who’s next You Me

The teacher MR SATLOF hurries over to break up the fight

MR SATLOF
Guys -- hey knock it off

Laine is too paralyzed to even cry Her world falling apart

Trevor lets go of Pete pushes through the crowd of students
and takes off down the hall

Pete wipes his face with his hand Bleeding from the nose
Laine reaches out to help him but he waves her off with an
embarrassed look -- “I’m fine” And then he heads off as
well from the scene

MOMENTS LATER The hallway has cleared Mr Satlof stands
with Laine She looks stunned Totally lost She can’t
even make eye contact

MR SATLOF (CONTD)
Losing two friends in such a short
time -- emotions are all over the
place right now

As we slowly ease in on Laine’s face

MR SATLOF (CONTD)
You need to talk to a counselor
It’s going to take a while to feel
normal again but you will overcome
this Laine There’s so much life
ahead for you

Laine glances up at Mr Satlof for the first time Vibrating
with urgency

LAINE
You’re wrong There’s no time
left
INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

Empty auditorium Mostly dark A couple of work lights on
stage reveal painted scenery flats for a school production

Laine wanders out onto the stage looking around for Pete A
VOICE comes through the sound system

PETE (0S)
If youre looking for me Im up
here

Laine squints against the light and sees Pete in an enclosed
sound booth in the back of the auditorium

INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SOUND BOOTH - DAY

Laine enters the small blacked-out space of the sound booth
The inner domain of the theater ‘tech crew’ guys Mixing
console Cable bundles Laine finally breaks the silence --

LAINE
Earlier with Trevor --

PETE
-- he’s scared We all are

Laine’s mind is running on fumes at this point

Laine and Pete are on the computer Looking for anything
that might help them It’s all basic info

LAINE
Nothing Same stuff on all the
sites

Laine gets up She goes to the window that looks out into
the auditorium Everything feels like a dead end

Pete stays at the computer He types Clicks Types again
Clicks Starts reading something on the screen --

PETE
Hey Come look at this

There’s now a PARANORMAL WEBSITE pulled up on the computer

PETE (CONTD)
I entered ‘Ouija’ and the initials
‘DZ’ into a search and this is
what came up I guess this
happened a while back

Laine clicks into an article The HEADLINE “Friends Die in
Tragic House Fire” She starts to read --

LAINE
‘Investigators never found a cause
for a fire that took the lives of
three high school students while
they slept’

As Laine reads we glimpse accompanying PHOTOS (circa early
80s) that are on the webpage Three TEENAGE GIRLS hanging
out in a bedroom Making faces And playing a OUIJA

LAINE (CONTD)
‘But there were rumors that the
girls had been playing with a Ouija
board’

PETE
‘Other friends from school
confirmed the reports And that
the name of the spirit during
contact went by the initials DZ’

Hearing those same initials it’s like Laine has the wind
knocked out of her

LAINE
This has happened before

Pete keeps reading --

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

PETE
‘In our research these initials
have appeared in other instances
in which players suffered various
outcomes sudden death due to
unexplained accidents cases
where people simply vanished
never seen again --’

Laine clicks on another PHOTO on the website FIRE
INVESTIGATORS sifting through the remains of the burned down
house Laine clicks another photo of the destruction -- and
notices something

She enlarges the image There -- amidst the charred remains
of the house -- a OUIJA BOARD Uncannily undamaged by the
fire And then another photo of the back of the board

ANOTHER PHOTO A BLACK SMUDGE on the back of the board The
shape it looks like a HANDPRINT

Laine turns to Pete her nerves shredded He’s on the same
wavelength The world feels like it’s closing in on them

LAINE
My god ‘Finish game’ I thought
it was a message -- something we

had to do to end this But it’s
his pattern DZ kills all the
players And then he’s finished
Moves on to the next game

PETE
and it starts all over again

INT HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Lights are off A TEACHER lectures at the front of the room
projecting science charts on a screen

DRIFT DOWN A ROW OF DESKS to Sarah sitting in the far back
An empty desk behind her

Sarah’s finding it hard to pay attention to the lecture Her
thoughts stray

She sets her pen down Closes her eyes Takes a breath
Trying to tune things out but something doesn’t feel right

Sarah opens her eyes The dim light in the classroom shifts
as the teacher advances to another chart

Sarah glances down at her desk Her pen sitting there
Beat and then it twitches

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

She keeps staring Maybe that didn’t just happen
Everything is very still the droning voice of the teacher
at the front of the class and the pen twitches again

Very slowly as if being moved by some unseen force it
starts to slide across her desk

Sarah watches in disbelief Can’t pull her eyes away This
seems impossible and yet it’s happening Right here in
class The pen continues its eerie drift from one side of
her desk to the other

She looks over at the student across the aisle from her
wondering if anyone else is seeing this But the guy has his
eyes up front Taking notes

BACK ON SARAH staring the pen still moving like some
kind of dreamy time-lapse

CLICK Another projection chart And in the momentary shift
of the light we see that SOMEONE -- an out-of-focus figure
-- is now sitting in that last desk behind Sarah that was
empty just moments ago

Sarah doesn’t notice entranced by the pen as it edges closer
and closer toward her hand

BEHIND HER The DARK FIGURE slightly tilts his head Cold
glints where the eyes should be just like the glimpse of
what we saw in the back seat of Isabelle’s car

ON SARAH’S DESK as the pen finishes its way across the
desk and then quickly slips right into Sarah’s hand

THE DARK FIGURE BEHIND HER -- leans in closer suddenly --

Sarah’s hand JERKS across the desk as she starts SCRAWLING
JAGGED LETTERS OUT ON THE COVER OF HER NOTEBOOK Pen
snapping Ink smearing

And Sarah can’t control it She can barely speak --

SARAH
Help somebody help me

Sarah frantically looks around the classroom It’s all
shadows No one notices her The TEACHER lecturing The
HUM of the projector Everything so far away Like Sarahs
desk is in a separate dimension

The pen SCRATCHES into the notebook MORE LETTERS being
scrawled out in messy smears of ink Can’t see what it says
in the dark

Sarah’s literally crying So helpless Fighting to resist --

but there’s nothing she can do Finally her hand comes to a
stop Her pen drops and clatters to the floor

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Frozen beat And now Sarah feels it SOMEONE sitting behind
her She slowly turns around in her seat daring a glance
back seeing something we don’t see Her eyes going wide --

-- and then WHOOSH Her whole desk SLIDES across the floor
of the classroom SMASHING HARD INTO A WALL

INSTANT COMMOTION in the class The lights are still off
Dim light from the projector STUDENTS trying to see what
happened

Sarah’s tumped over on the floor Her wild eyes shooting to
the desk that was behind her -- and it’s empty No one
sitting there TEACHER’S VOICE calls out --

TEACHER
Sarah what the hell’s going on
back there Everyone settle down

Sarah grabs her NOTEBOOK and scrambles up Moves through the
dark toward the door Has to get out of here now

INT HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Sarah bursts from the classroom -- RIGHT INTO LAINE AND PETE
IN THE HALLWAY

Laine sees how panicked her sister is The tears on her
face And Sarah keeps looking back at the classroom door

LAINE
Sarah what is it --

SARAH
-- he’s here

PETE
Wait What happened

Sarahs looking everywhere Paranoid Doesn’t even feel
safe standing in the hallway

SARAH
He’s here Following us wherever
we go
Laine glimpses Sarah’s NOTEBOOK clutched in her arms -- the

jagged carved letters She gently takes the notebook from
Sarah It doesn’t look like anything until she turns it
upside down A MESSAGE --

FINSH GAME

And now in the light Sarah finally sees the message as well
She stares with a sick look

Hey those things I said

You’re here now That’s all that
matters
TREVOR
So why are we here

EXT VACANT LOT - DUSK

LONG SHOT In the fading light of day Laine Trevor Pete
and Sarah walk through the tall dead grass heading toward
the spot where they burned the Ouija board

Sarah stops Doesn’t want to go any further

Laine continues on walks up to a spot in the dirt Black
charred bits of wood and grey ash Remnants from the fire

Laine leans down brushes away the ash
Pete and Trevor stand over her shoulder watching

Laine keeps sweeping the ash away with her hand a familiar
antique font alphabet appearing underneath

It’s the OUIJA BOARD Totally intact As if the fire never
touched it The PLANCHETTE too Not burned It’s perfect

Everyone stares It’s a nightmare they can’t escape

Laine stands with the board in her hands Beat She turns
it over And theres a BLACK SMUDGE on the back That same
CREEPY HANDPRINT we glimpsed in the Ouija internet article

LAINE
I saw this before On Debbies
video she was standing in the

mirror Something was on her skin
It was this A handprint His
handprint

Laine looks over at Sarah standing there with her sleeves
pulled to her wrist Laine doesnt even need to say
anything

SARAH
Dont make me look I dont want
to know
Laine comes over gently pulls one of Sarahs sleeves up

Nothing there Pulls the other one up and theres the
DARK HANDPRINT on her forearm

SARAH (CONTD)
Im next Im going to die

Sarah frantically tries to wipe away the black handprint
She’s totally losing it Laine takes her sisters face
trying to calm her

LAINE
No I won’t let that happen We
have to play one last time and then
it’s over Do you trust me

Sarah holds the look with Laine -- nods
EXT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - DUSK

Sun setting Trees casting long shadows EASE IN on the
dark windows

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The downstairs is totally still for a long beat then a
FIGURE moves through the shadowed house Stepping through
the broken mirror shards on the floorboards

It’s DEBBIE’S MOTHER She walks slowly Eyes searching
Expectant She freezes at hearing a dull SLIDING sound
coming from upstairs

MRS GALARDI
Debbie

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER
Debbie’s mother stands at the bottom of the stairs looking
up She reaches for the handrail and begins to head up
passing photos of her daughter along the wall Debbie’s face
distorted by the shadows on the glass as she passes
MRS GALARDI
Are you here baby Let me see you
-- I need to see you

From upstairs that dull SLIDING sound again

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Mrs Galardi keeps moving up the stairway Suddenly she
stops Gasping at the sight of --
-- a DARK FIGURE standing at the very top of the stairs by
the wall The face is concealed with one of Debbie’s painted
theatre MASKS

Mrs Galardi smiles in astonishment Her eyes alive

MRS GALARDI (CONTD)
I knew it I knew you were here

THE FIGURE just stands there Not moving

Mrs Galardi continues up the stairs almost to the top
now just inches away from the FIGURE

MRS GALARDI (CONTD)
I want to see that beautiful face
just once more

Mrs Galardi reaches out with trembling hands and slowly
begins to lift the mask We don’t see what she sees --

-- as the smile fades from her face Mrs Galardi stares
with the most devastating expression of dawning horror And
then it’s as if she simply can’t take what she’s looking at
and she SCREAMS Loses her footing on the stairs Suddenly
STUMBLES BACKWARDS --

EXT DEBBIES HOUSE - NIGHT

Pete’s car pulls up Everyone gets out but Laine instantly
sees something that makes her face fall --

MRS GALARDI’S EMPTY CAR Parked out in front of Debbies
house like before Drivers side door wide open

Laine turns -- sees that the front door is cracked open She
hurries toward the house

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Laine moves past the same bits of broken mirror on the floor
Scanning the dark The house absolutely silent

Laine keeps going She rounds the corner to the stairs

glances up to see that they are empty Beat about to move
on looking down -- and there’s that MASK at the bottom of
the steps

Icy beat Laine stares Reaches down to pick it up --

-- WHEN SOMEONE SUDDENLY GRABS HER ARMS Laine staggers in
shock It’s MRS GALARDI Crawling out from the shadows
Dazed and hurt from a bad fall down the stairs Grabbing
onto Laine in a blind panic

It’s alright I’m here I’m right
here
But Mrs Galardi keeps staring up at the top of the stairs

MRS GALARDI

-- not alone -- she wasn’t alone --
LAINE
Hang on hang on -- I’m going to

call for help
And now Debbie’s mother raises an arm and points up Laine
turns in that direction looking toward the top of the
stairs But it’s just emptiness up there
DISSOLVE TO

into an ambulance Doors shut

THROUGH THE AMBULANCE DOORS as it pulls away Looking out at

stands there in the street

EXT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Laine enters the backyard The others are already here
Waiting The mood is so grim

She hit her head pretty hard They
think she fell down the stairs
But she’ll be okay

They turn and look up at the dark house knowing they have to
go inside A NIGHT WIND starts to rise as we go --

POV OF TREVORS VIDEO CAMERA Set up like before Same
angle on the Ouija board

INT DEBBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

Just like the previous games everyone is in place around the
Ouija board But now -- only FOUR PLAYERS instead of five

One by one each player puts their fingertips on the
planchette Laine offers a final caution --

LAINE
What we all did to make contact we
now have to do in reverse Thats
how we close the door
(beat)
No matter what happens don’t take
your hand away

The air is absolutely electric Laine begins saying the
words weve heard before but backwards --

LAINE (CONTD)
You to call we near spirits
-true are hearts gathered
we have friends as

Everything’s quiet Laine glances at the others
LAINE (CONTD)
Now four times around the board
One for each of us Backwards

Together they circle the board -- counter-clockwise -- with
the planchette Very cautiously Completing a full cycle

SARAH
Okay One down

LAINE
Keep going
Hope rising They start the second circle and THE
PLANCHETTE STARTS TO VIBRATE AND RATTLE against the surface
of the board

PETE
It’s DZ

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

They keep pushing at the planchette but it’s as if the piece
is suddenly heavy Hard to move

PETE (CONTD)
He’s pushing back

There’s a DEEP LOW GROAN somewhere in the house
VIDEO CAMERA ANGLE -- Eyes dart Everyone heard that

TREVOR
He knows what were doing

LAINE
Do not stop

THE IMAGE GLITCHES -- like we saw before when Laine was
watching the footage of Debbie’s games

And in the momentary distortion beyond the four players
sitting around the board there is ANOTHER PRESENCE in the
shadows

BACK WITH THE GROUP -- FINGERTIPS PUSHING Veins in hands
straining The planchette finally finishing the second
circle

That OTHERWORLDLY GROAN IN THE HOUSE -- LOUDER Sounds as if
it’s moving behind the walls Across the ceiling

SARAH
Two more C’mon c’mon c’mon --

They start to move the planchette -- and somewhere in the
darkness a DOOR SLAMS The sound THUNDERS THROUGH THE HOUSE

TREVOR
It’s not working it’s not
working

LAINE

Goddammit Focus

(calling out into the

room)
DZ -- we know you’re here We’re
ending the game

And everyone keeps PUSHING THE PLANCHETTE as it seems to
literally fight against their efforts

The third circle complete On to the last

LAINE (CONTD)
We can do this

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

The planchette inches slowly moving THE UNGODLY NOISE
in the house rises -- LOUDER -- the planchette finishes the
fourth and final circle around the board

LAINE (CONTD)
Hurry Move it to ‘Good Bye’ and
we’re done

Together they move the planchette toward the words at the
bottom of the board -- but it stops RATTLING in place
Won’t go any further An incredible force pushing back
against them

The lanterns FLICKER AND DIM THE GROANING SOUND falls away
as everything becomes eerily quiet

LAINE (CONTD)
C’mon almost there

A breathless beat --

-- as the lantern softly FLICKERS Faster Now strobe-like
BLASTS OF LIGHT and then total darkness Over and over

And in those FLASHES -- glimpses of a FIFTH PERSON NOW
SITTING WITH THE OTHERS AT THE BOARD An 18-year-old YOUNG
MAN Ghostly Eyes filled with menace It’s D2Z

Everyone sees him Holy shit

Another FLASH of light -- and now he’s gone

Back into darkness Sarah’s SCREAM suddenly fills the room --
Laine looks over Face going slack --

-- BECAUSE SARAHS BEING LIFTED KICKING AND SCREAMING OFF THE
FLOOR Something shadowy and mostly unseen is behind her --
holding her -- making it look like Sarah’s levitating in the
rapid-fire strobes of light

And then -- WHOOSH Sarah goes flying across the room OUT
INTO THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY THE BEDROOM DOOR SLAMMING SHUT

Pandemonium Everyone scrambles up from the floor and runs
to the door Trying to get it open Sarah SCREAMS from the
other side --

From the space at the bottom of the door Sarahs fingers
desperately reach out Feeling out onto the floor

and Pete struggle with the door

Laine holds tight but now Sarah is totally frantic in the
hallway Like she’s not out there alone

Her fingers slip away right out of Laine’s grasp
As Trevor and Pete finally get the door open --

-- INTO THE HALLWAY And Sarah’s not there Laine takes in
the empty hallway

TREVOR
Where the hell is she

LAINE
SARAH

No answer Laine grabs a flashlight CLICK

The three of them move down the upstairs hallway All we can
see are their faces in the light

UP AHEAD -- the various bedroom doors More darkness within
each room It feels like anything could be waiting around
the next corner

THE THREE SPLIT UP -- their lights moving away from each
other Into rooms down the stairs

Pete checks the parents’ bedroom Searching the dark
Moving fast Everything looks so normal The neatly made
bed Vanity table Woman’s dress hanging on an armoire

AWFUL SOUND rises

Laine stops Breathing hard Listening As the sound MOVES
FROM BEHIND THE WALL -- SCRAPING OVERHEAD -- ACROSS THE
CEILING -- and then off into the house Like a presence
passing Quiet again

Laine summons her resolve arrives at the CLOSED DOOR
Beat She quickly twists the door knob and pushes into --

THE GARAGE Laine shines her light into the dark corners
but Sarah’s not here

Laine’s desperation grows She calls out --

Sarah Can you hear me

Behind her in the hallway -- SOMEONE’S NOW STANDING THERE in

VOICE

THE FIGURE moves Not walking They eerily slide out of
view off into the house

Laine turns -- not seeing anyone

ELSEWHERE WITH TREVOR -- heading toward the back of the

Trevor swings the light over toward the sliding glass door
leading to the back It’s OPEN He steps closer -- ‘Is
Sarah out there’

Everything still A WATERY SOUND

-as A SHAPE MOVES BENEATH THE POOL COVER

Somethings in the water

At first he can’t believe it A trick of the eyes Trevor
steps toward the edge of the pool A SICK GURGLING SOUND
as the SHAPE moves again under the pool cover

Sarah
Trevor moves fast He reaches down peels the pool cover
back brackish water underneath Impossible to see

anything as --
-- AN EXPLOSIVE SPLASH LANTERN DROPS TO THE CONCRETE

-- and Trevor is VIOLENTLY PULLED INTO THE POOL
Disappearing under the surface of the water

The pool settles Quiet Stay here for as long as we can
get away with We’re now literally holding our breath
Waiting for Trevor to come up

-but he never does

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

WITH PETE At the back sliding glass door He hears the
soft lapping of the pool looks out -- sees the fallen
lantern lying on the concrete but no Trevor

EXT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

PETE RUNS FOR THE POOL Arrives at the edge Shines his
light down into the dark water Can’t see Trevor

Pete reaches in his hands searching water splashing
everywhere desperate --

-- AND THEN HE GRABS HOLD OF SOMETHING Pulls

It’s TREVOR Coming up out of the water Head sagging
Drenched Lifeless

PETE
No no no Trevor c’mon

Pete strains with everything he’s got and manages to hoist
Trevor out of the pool Lays him on the concrete Trevor
doesn’t move at all

Pete puts his ear to Trevor’s chest listens for a
heartbeat His expression says it all -- this isn’t good

Pete shakes Trevor

PETE (CONT’D)
Trevor --

Nothing Trevor’s not moving Not breathing

Pete puts his hands into CPR position He pumps on Trevor’s
chest Again Again --

-- Trevors whole body JOLTS as he coughs up water Gasps
for breath Eyes blinking Taking in air He finally
focuses on Pete Realizes he just saved his life

Pete holds a look with him -- relieved

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Laine enters a bathroom Clutching her light in the
darkness She scans the small space No sign of Sarah

about to leave when --

-- there’s a sound Coming from behind the glass shower
door A dull THUMP THUMP

Laine turns Stares at the shower She waits for the sound
to come again but it’s just silence

She takes a step closer Flashlight trembling in her grip
Trying to see through the opaque shower door glass

Another step -- and THUMP Something SLAMS against the other
side of the glass A DISTORTED FIGURE One HAND -- then
another SLAMS against the glass

Laine FREAKS Swings her light wildly as --

-- the shower door CREAKS open and THE FIGURE stumbles out
COLLIDING RIGHT INTO LAINE

Laine’s light finally settles to see that it’s Sarah Her
eyes are dazed She looks totally disoriented Traumatized

Laine holds her sister Brushing the hair out of her face
Sarah’s so scared trying to get the words out --

SARAH
He told me

Her voice fades Eyes unable to focus

LAINE
Hey It’s me Sarah It’s Laine
Are you hurt Talk to me

Sarah is falling apart Shaking all over like she has
hypothermia

SARAH
He’s playing with us

LAINE
Just breathe

SARAH
This is the only thing he wants
that taste of life again

SARAH (CONTD)
He finishes with us and then it’s
another game It keeps going and
going

EASE IN ON LAINE -- as she’s suddenly hit with a MEMORY
DEBBIE ON THE VIDEO Playing the Ouija alone in her room
DEBBIE
Let’s start a new game How does
that sound Okay Good Here we
go
SNAP BACK TO LAINE -- a revelation now clear to her
LAINE
Another game that’s what she was
doing Trying to protect me
Beat Laine puts her flashlight into Sarah’s hands
LAINE (CONTD)
Sarah -- I want you to stay right
here Youll be safe

SARAH
Don’t leave me

LAINE
I love you

SARAH
Wait why are you saying that --

LAINE
-- no matter what happens you
remember that Okay Worm
Laine’s pulls away

SARAH
Laine

But she’s gone Hurrying off into the dark house
INT DEBBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

THE OUIJA sits on the floor Right where the group left it
Lantern to the side The board seems larger than life

Laine steps into the doorway in the background Regards the
board Heavy She comes into the room and closes the door
Locks it

Laine kneels down at the Ouija She hesitates -- then places
her fingertips on the planchette

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

She slowly starts to circle the board Clockwise One time

LAINE
As friends we’ve gathered hearts
are true Spirits near we call to

you
(beat)
DZ -- if you’re here make your
presence known
It’s now clear what Laine’s doing -- she’s here to play the
game alone

SUDDENLY -- A STRANGE POV Looking up at Laine through the
Ouija board Like it’s a window into the room The letters
and words on the board are all backwards And the sound in
this place -- an evil LOW GROANING like a rising storm

BACK WITH LAINE in the shadowy room

LAINE (CONTD)
Just tell me that you’re here
Talk to me

EASE IN ON THE PLANCHETTE Totally still A twitch under
Laine’s fingertips The planchette moves Spells out the
familiar greeting -- HI FREND

LAINE (CONTD)
Hi friend Then our game has
started
(beat)
I know something about you all
the games youve played before
The terrible things you have done

The entire room seems to react with menace A dull wind in
the dark blowing against Laine

LAINE (CONTD)
You move game to game One to the
next And now youre playing with
me Just the two of us That
means the last game is over You
can’t hurt my friends can’t hurt
my sister Not anymore

The planchette RATTLES on the board There’s an angry energy
in the room

LAINE (CONTD)
But I’m here I’m ready

INT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT

Pete and the still soaking wet Trevor hurry through the
house Their light catching sight of Sarah But Trevor
immediately notices that Laine’s absent

TREVOR
Where’s Laine

SARAH
She went upstairs

With a sick realization --

PETE
She’s with the Ouija Alone

INT DEBBIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Laine is still at the board Fingers still in place

The LANTERN flickers as Laine’s hit by an angry uncanny blast
of wind An angry energy filling the room

The closet door swings open The mirror mounted to the
inside reveals Laines reflection She gasps at the sight
of a prominent large black HANDPRINT now on her arm She has
been marked

And then she sees in the reflection -- BEHIND HER -- someone
standing there It’s DZ He reaches out toward her with a
strange stuttering arm

Suddenly -- THE MIRROR CRACKS Spiderwebs

A loose shard rattles in the mirror -- then sucked away by
the wind Flies across the room The sharp piece SLICES
Laine’s cheek Draws blood

There’s POUNDING on the other side of the door Trevors
voice faintly yelling under the rising chaos in Debbie’s
room

WHOOSH Debbie’s shelves slide in front of the door No
one’s getting in

Laine shoots a look to the door Knows she’s trapped
Bathed in a little island of lantern light in the inky black
that surrounds her This is where she’s going to die

She takes a brave breath Closes her eyes Ready

SLOWLY MOVE DOWN LAINE TO THE PLANCHETTE rattling on the
board -- as OTHER HANDS reach in Fingertips touching

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Laine senses something Opens her eyes Astonished to see
that SOMEONE is sitting across from her Playing the game
It’s a TEENAGE GIRL The girl looks up with sad eyes

It’s DEBBIE

Laine whispers in amazement Totally overcome with emotion
to see her old friend sitting across from her

LAINE
Debbie

DEBBIE
Never play alone Laine

The way Debbie says these words so full of regret Laine
starts to cry And Debbie does too

Debbie looks around her room At all of her things And
then sees her bracelet on Laines wrist She reaches out and
touches it A piece of her living on through Laine

LAINE
I shouldve been there for you
Im so sorry If I could do it all
over again

Debbie smiles through her tears All is forgiven between
them But Debbie’s smile slowly fades sensing something --

-- and she suddenly spins and looks behind her Terrified

DEBBIE
Laine -- he’s coming
The LANTERN flickers In the flash of light DEBBIE NOW
LOOKS HORRENDOUS Plastic dry cleaning bag wrapped tight
around her screaming twitching head

Another LAMP flicker -- back to normal A part of her stuck
here Can’t move on

DEBBIE (CONTD)
Take your hands away

Laine shakes her head

LAINE
No Im not leaving you again

The vibe in the room grows more intense All around them A
FIGURE drifts in and out of the shadows There Then over
there It feels like being in the very heart of evil

The PLANCHETTE twitches across the board

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

DEBBIE
You have to Laine you have to
say goodbye

Laine is crying harder Shaking her head Terrified but
willing to die right here

LAINE
I cant

DEBBIE
You need to go Laine Live a good
life Do great things
The two girls lock eyes with each other

DEBBIE (CONTD)
-for me

Laine is overcome Can barely get the words out

LAINE
Good bye

Laine pulls her hands away from the board

Alone Debbie does a reverse circle around the board
Finally moves the planchette to GOOD BYE but she’s looking
at Laine when she says

DEBBIE
Goodbye

THE ROOM IS RATTLING LIKE HELL Everything reaching a final
pitch fury --

Debbie is now looking over Laine’s shoulder

Laine slowly turns-- glances behind her -- A DARK FIGURE
STANDS THERE Hovering above them The uncanny wind howling
and storming around Laine

Suddenly -- DEBBIE ERUPTS in her own fury For a split
second that disturbing death appearance of the plastic bag
around her twitching head FLASH Then normal again

She bolts off the floor Takes four running steps at THE
FIGURE Both of them falling back into the shadows

The WIND ON LAINE IS FEROCIOUS She SCREAMS Can barely
hear her The LANTERN FLICKERS HARD then total darkness

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Trevor SHOVES at the door Finally gets it open --

INT DEBBIE’S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
-- he bursts into the room --

-- to find that everything is totally still He shines his
light around the room The calm after the storm

Laine’s not here

It’s just the board sitting on the middle of the floor A
smear of blood on it Next to the board the planchette
It’s literally cracked in half

Sarah moves in behind Trevor Taking in the room Doesn’t
see her sister anywhere

SARAH
Laine

And Sarah starts sobbing Fearing the worst Trevor holds
her Both of them speechless

Pete crouches down Nudges the broken planchette with his
flashlight Taking in the stillness of the room

A faint sound He shines his light over by the bed Cant
see anything Pete moves forward closer around the
side of the bed

And there’s LAINE Huddled in a corner Her head buried in
her arm

Pete gently reaches out touches her
Laine glances up Surprised to see him Surprised that

she’s even here Laine looks at her arm -- the handprint
mark that was there is gone

Sarah turns Sees her sister Races over to her Crying
even harder now They hold each other Not letting go

EXT DEBBIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

PULL AWAY from the house The horror truly feels over The
spirit moving on to the next game Somewhere out there

DISSOLVE TO

CLOSE A PIECE OF PARCHMENT Letters appearing one by one
spelling out the name DEBORAH

EXT CEMETERY - DAY
Trees Grass WE FIND LAINE at Debbie’s grave Making a

rubbing of her headstone Finished she pulls the parchment
away revealing the full inscription

SARAH TREVOR AND PETE are standing here too They all place
a flower at the grave and then step away Allowing Laine to
have a final moment

Laine places her single white flower among the others She
kisses her fingers touches the headstone

Laine rises A last look and she steps away
