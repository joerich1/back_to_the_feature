As the bus jostles through traffic we begin to hear the
sound of a GOSPEL CHOIR rise up on the TRACK

EXT SCRIPTURE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Scripture Cathedral stands like a giant glowing ark above the
ruined neighborhood The MUSIC comes from inside Its an
upbeat spiritual Completely Yes

INT SCRIPTURE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Home of the black Pentecostals This is truly a cathedral
for Washingtons down and out Theres a 60 ceiling and a
40-tall illuminated cross Tonight the place rocks

The congregation is led by BISHOP LONG Hes a heavyset man
in his early 50s with a wide leonine head atop a cinder-block
body In the choir Cedric steps forward and sings the solo
His voice is clear and true This is the world where hes
most at home where he shines

CEDRIC
‘Lord I give my everything to You
I give it completely through and through
From the bottom of my heart to the
depths of my soul
I say yes Lord My soul says Yes

Barbara sits in a back pew watching her son with pride A
matron behind her puts an arm on her shoulder This is
LOUISE She whispers

LOUISE
Aint your boy all that tonight

Barbara smiles briefly but then her eyes shift to the
missionary men who rise and starts down the aisles with
wicker baskets Its collection time As Cedric pauses in
the solo Bishop Long steps forward

BISHOP LONG
(shouts )
Lets talk about when you give your
last dollar to God If you have one
dollar in your pocket then you give
the Lord that dollar

The congregation murmurs Amen You tell it Hallelujah
Barbara gets out her 20 and her 10 fingers them nervously

( )

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)
Only when you trust Jesus to take care
of you will you know what faith is all
about Faith is taking your last 10
from your checking account and saying
‘God I give this to you because I
have nothing but faith I live on
faith and I know in my heart that
youll bring it back to me in ways too
grand and too many for me to even
imagine

The missionary men have reached Barbaras row They extend
the basket towards her Other parishioners people who can
ill afford to part with their money are adding their bills
to the pile Barbara pulls the 20 and the 10 from the
pocket of her dark blue skirt The basket gets closer She
hesitates She wants to give it all but she cant do it
At the last minute she drops in the 20 and keeps the 10

The choir starts to sing the chorus of Completely Yes
again We REMAIN long enough to enjoy the upbeat lyrics to
see the ecstasy of the congregation to let the beauty of the
music sink in and then

Cedric and Barbara walk home through the rough neighborhood

The two walk in comfortable silence as the MUSIC ENDS But

He hits the corner of V Street and 16th As always open for

CEDRIC

MR TAYLOR
(careful)
And how was that

Cedric closes his books looks right at Mr Taylor His face
is straightforward his voice flat He talks almost without
emotion the way people do when something means so much to
them they cant let their pain show at all

CEDRIC

time I saw him I was six years old

CEDRIC (V0)
Then one day I found this jar of shiny
coins in his car And I took them
I was just a kid I didnt know what
I was doing They were pretty He
found out and he beat me with his belt

Turned out they were some kinda rare
coins someone gave him for heroin
Now hes doing 12 to 35 for armed
robbery and dealing I saw him and
this is what I learned My father
thinks Im not good enough to be his
kid

Cedric stares out the window at the grim urban landscape
The air in the room is very still Mr Taylor is stunned by
Cedrics words

MR TAYLOR
Is that why you want to go to MIT To
prove him wrong

CEDRIC
I wanted to go to MIT for me Not for
him

MR TAYLOR

You wanted to go
(almost afraid to ask)
The summer program

CEDRIC
I called The letters went out two
weeks ago If Ida got in Id know

Mr Taylor is heartbroken for Cedric but tries not to show
it Cedric rises and loads his backpack

CEDRIC (CONTD)

Crazy anyway Wanting to go to
someplace like that Probably woulda
hated it Im better off here with my
own people

(bitter)
Ill go to community college Yeah
Or trade school Thats the place for
me Not somewhere Ive never even
seen

MR TAYLOR
(rises)
Hebrews 111 The substance of faith
is a hope in the unseen

( )

CEDRIC
(stops)
Thats not how it goes Mr Taylor
You messed it up Faith is the
substance of things hoped for the
evidence of things not seen

MR TAYLOR
Extra points for you Take from the
Holy Scripture what you need Nothing
more The point is what your father
wants what the other kids say
doesnt mean anything because you know
where youre going

The song finishes and everyone sits

Bishop Long rises from

a cushioned chair at the center of the altar and moves to the

pulpit

BISHOP LONG
Tonight I have a heavy heart

Bishop Long waits for the joyous faces to turn somber
matching his mood and they do

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)

There is evil in this world a
darkness an unholiness that is taking
our children I presided over a
funeral today

(his voice falls

masterfully quiet)
A boy only fifteen years old cut
down like so many of our young ones

Faces sag and heads nod

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)
Violence poverty crime despair
loss What we are up against in this
world the burden seems too heavy
sometimes Like the deck is stacked
against us

Voices call out Tell it brother Barbara looks back for

Cedric

Again hes not there

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)
It feels so hopeless Like theres no
more that we can do Children taken
before their time Victims of
violence Sons and fathers in prison
or worse Where is our refuge I ask
you WHERE IS OUR REFUGE

The congregation is hushed now He lowers his voice

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)
It is here within these walls

The crowd shouts Amen

IN THE BACK the door opens slowly and Cedric enters
tentative Hes drenched from the rain confused
brokenhearted and unsure he wants to be here

( )

Softly

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)
Our refuge is with each other and
our refuge is with God If you dont
have a dime in your pocket if you
dont have food on your table if you
got troubles youre in the right
place tonight

People shout out Hallelujahs and raise their arms Cedric
remains quiet keeping himself apart

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)
I know all about what youre up
against Ive been there Trust me
Do you trust me

Shouts of Yes MOVE IN ON CEDRIC his face intent

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)
Terrible things are happening Youre
low youre tired youre fighting
youre waiting for your vision to
become reality Seems like youve
been waiting forever and you cant
keep carrying the burden no more
Sometimes you just want to give up
But you cant And you wont Not
ever Thats why youre here Your
belief is what keeps you apart
Belief in yourself and your God You
are safe in this protection and you
will survive whatever may come There
is nothing you and your God cant
handle You will survive Say it I
will make it SAY IT

CROWD
I will make it

BISHOP LONG
Say ‘I will endure

CROWD
I will endure

Now Barbara sees Cedric Her face floods with relief He
sees her too and then loses sight of her as everyone rises
to their feet

BISHOP LONG
When your family deserts you When
you are alone and facing a storm

BISHOP LONG (CONTD)
Someone is always with you and that
someone is the Lord God God loves
you I love you And YOU WILL REACH
YOUR GOAL

Bishop Long turns to the choir and they launch into another
chorus of the same hymn Everyone sings

EVERYONE

I will be free one day
Ive got a home in the sky

The lyrics are moving The congregation starts clapping
And again Im going to fly away I will be free one day

Im from Baltimore

JENICA

at Wellesley High

CEDRIC

Dont you be tellin me your folks are
teachers

MICAH
No my moms an insurance adjuster
My dads a lawyer

Suddenly Cedric feels alone again These kids may be his
color but theyre nothing like him They wait for Cedric to
contribute to this line of conversation

CEDRIC
My mama she works for the Department
of Agriculture

They nod Sounds good

MICAH
Whats your dad do

Cedric pauses decides to face the situation head on Not
apologize for who or what he is

CEDRIC
Right now 12 to 35 in a Virginia
prison Hes a heroin addict Hes
in for armed robbery My mama raised
me From when I was born it was just
the two of us

A moment of stunned silence The girls literally dont know
what to say Cedric is from another world The teacher
THOMAS LIVINGSTON a handsome young black grad student and a
PhD candidate at MIT begins to speak The girls turn to
watch him relieved

LIVINGTON
Good morning everyone
(MORE)

( )

LIVINGTON (CONTD)
Were starting today with a discussion
of particle physics For some of you
this will be review Particle physics
deals with the elements that make up
matter and the forces between them
These elements consist of electrons
neutrinos and quarks The forces
derive from electromagnetism and its
generalizations

Livingston moves to the blackboard and starts ripping across
jamming the chalkboard with words and drawings Cedric
stares The kids watch patiently

Cedric feels a stab of fear He grabs a pen and starts
scribbling madly jotting down everything on the board

LIVINGTON (CONTD)
Another force experienced by quarks
only is due to gluons There are
eight types of these and they interact
with each other so that the forces
are intrinsically nonlinear Quarks
and gluons never appear as well-
separated particles and the evidence
for them although strong is indirect

Cedric tries vainly to write down everything Livingston is
saying When he looks up he realizes with horror that Isa
Micah and Jenica arent even taking notes

INT MIT HALLWAY - DAY

Cedric heads for the next class He hazards a conversation
with a fair-skinned kid who is half Asian half black

ANDREW

Fine No problems

CEDRIC
Oh yeah I think its pretty hard
Im like afraida my hand fallin off
takin notes

ANDREW
(with pointedly careful
English)
Then maybe you need to write less and
listen more

Cedric reacts humiliated They go into class
INT MIT CALCULUS - DAY

The teacher JOSEPH LEVERICH is talking to Andrew as if he
were a peer Cedric watches stunned by Andrews knowledge
and self-confidence

LEVERICH
Since most of the tests of convergence
for improper integrals are only valid
for positive functions is it
legitimate to wonder what happens to
improper integrals involving
nonpositive functions

ANDREW
Obviously

LEVERICH
And the natural way you generate a
positive number from a given number is
to take the absolute value of the
number So consider a function f(x)
not necessarily positive defined on
ab Then consider the positive
function f(x) still defined on
ab Will both functions f(x) and
£(x) exhibit the same kind of
improper behavior

Only one kid in the class has the answer

ANDREW
Yes They will

INT CEDRICS DORM ROOM - EARLY MORNING

The clock reads 2 am Cedric is surrounded by handouts He
starts copying notes on Aldous Huxleys Brave New World He
writes Population divided into castes (social class
rank) Alphas and Betas more intelligent and manage society
Deltas and Gammas less intelligent and do menial tasks

He stares at what he wrote It still makes no sense He

chair swallows -- the sound seems to fill the room

Well I dont think youre MIT
material Your academic record isnt
strong enough

CEDRIC
What do you mean ‘academic record
I mean my high school grades couldnt
be much better

Trilling looks to retrieve a key number

TRILLING
I see your SATs are only 910 Right
there thats at least 200 points
below what you need to be accepted at
MIT And also your work here this
summer has not been up to that of many
of the other students

I cant ever have SATs like the other
kids They dont come from the same
place as me

TRILLING
(coldly corrects him)
The other kids dont come from the
same place as I

Cedrics jaw works He hates this man his attitude of
superiority his ignorance But Cedrics voice gets quieter
and more intense

( )

CEDRIC
I worked harder than any kid youve
had here What you gotta know about
me is when I set my mind on
something anything I can get there
Its about wanting it more in your
heart

His throat catches on the last words Hes fighting tears
TRILLING
That perspective that belief is
admirable Cedric But it can also
set you up for disappointment And at
the present time it isnt enough

Trilling is anxious to get out of this interview and nothing
Cedric says will change his mind He rises

TRILLING (CONTD)

There are lots of other good schools

Maybe in a year or two if you do

Thats not true Because I will
succeed at Brown or wherever I end up
I know this because of the most
important lesson my mother ever taught

myself

JOANNE NELSON (CONTD)
Remember this Langston Hughes poem we
read in class Called Dreams

CEDRIC
(reads)
‘Hold fast to dreams for if dreams
die life is a broken winged bird
(looks up)
I guess every person has a dream to
walk across that stage at graduation

JOANNE NELSON

Make sure you think about what other
kids feel too

just-washed beakers storing everything for the summer

Hi Mr Taylor

MR TAYLOR

Cedric eases into his favorite desk by the window with the
familiar names etched in the top

CEDRIC (CONTD)
I hear they got some good honor
students coming up next year

MR TAYLOR
Mostly girls One sophomore boy looks
promising
(beat)

But theres no one like you

Mr Taylor ducks his head not wanting to get sentimental
But Cedric is touched Mr Taylor covers by changing the
subject

MR TAYLOR (CONTD)
Hey did I tell you what happened at
the Boston Marathon in April

CEDRIC
No Not a story about another race
Got a Bible quote for me too

Taylor holds up his finger comes over and gets into it

MR TAYLOR
Listen to what happened You know
that a marathon is 26 miles And
theres a place in this one called
Heartbreak Hill By the time I got
there I felt like my heart was gonna
burst I looked over and this woman
was running alongside me She was
white Older woman We started to
talk She told me she was a judge in
Boston She was tired that judge

( )

MR TAYLOR (CONTD)
She pointed out a coffee shop and said
she was ready to call it quits go in
there and get herself a cool drink
So I told her ‘Im feelin that way
too sometimes you feel so tired you
cant go on but thats when you got
to reach for deeper inspiration

CEDRIC
(calls out like in
church)
You tell it Mr Taylor

MR TAYLOR
And then Cedric I began to sing to
her right there as we ran

Cedrics jaw drops in surprise and encouragement Mr Taylor
throws back his head and sings out

MR TAYLOR (CONTD)
‘When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrow like sea billows roll
Whatever my lot thou hath taught me to
Say
It is well it is well with my soul
It is well it is well with my soul

As Taylor begins to repeat the verse Cedric wordlessly gets
up and moves to the blackboard all reflex He begins
scribbling sine and cosine Xs and parentheses The
scribbles are part of a calculus proof

MR TAYLOR
The integrating of two whole numbers
I see You still got it Look at
that boy go

CEDRIC
I wish all integration was this easy
Wed all be better off

Taylor laughs and starts singing even louder Chalk is
flying white chips falling at Cedrics feet as his hand
moves in furious arcs the dark green board filling with

1000 people fan themselves with their programs The
auditorium is packed and sweltering the crowd raucous
Women mostly some casually dressed in jeans and others more
formal Many have come straight from work and wear uniforms
nurse toll guard cop The school band is finishing Pomp

SEE Phillip Janeece and Trevor Trevor does a little tap to
Pomp and Circumstance waves to his family

Cedric is near the front looking tall and thin in his royal-

Barbara sits with her friend Louise and a few family members
including Cedrics paternal GRANDMOTHER

BARBARA

Before the last stanza of Pomp and Circumstance is over
people are SCREAMING We all love you Tanisha We all

whoops and yells all around Clearly there will be none of
the usual decorum of suburban graduation ceremonies here
Principal Washington steps forward to admonish the crowd

PRINCIPAL WASHINGTON
Our young people have prepared

The roar doesnt subside A svelte well-dressed woman BOARD
MEMBER takes another mike

BOARD MEMBER
Can you quiet down just a little bit
This is an important day in these

quiet it wont be as hot

An OBESE WOMAN behind Barbara offers the crowds reply

Oh puleeze A skinny lady like that

This gets a laugh Finally with no point in waiting any

Cedric Jennings

Barbara is unspeakably happy to be the mother of this boy
Cedric takes the podium flips his tassel to the far side of
his mortar board rustles the pages of typed notes and
finally clears his throat From the audience someone sings
out the mocking version of his name that means nerd

CLASSMATE
Ceeeedric Yo Ceeeedric

Cedric stops a moment and the WORDS ECHO There is an
uncomfortable murmur in the crowd Cedric stands taller He
looks down and quiet but steady reads from his text

CEDRIC
Thank you Principal Washington Id
first like to start by thanking God
for giving me the strength and courage
to be where I am today I would also
like to thank the many people who have
had a positive impact on my life
especially my mother

Barbara smiles and Louise pats her hand but the DIN in the
audience rises as murmuring begins People are flipping
their programs and wondering how many speeches there will be
Cedric pushes forward gamely making his voice louder

CEDRIC (CONTD)
When I was asked to deliver the
salutatory address I was worried
because it seemed an awesome
responsibility Many of us who are
going on to college to work or to
the military feel fear as we face our
future But if we the class of 1995
are to brave a new day we must become
self-sufficient and determined in
rising to the challenges of the 21st
century

A MAN near the stage turns to his daughter and says loudly so
everyone can hear

MAN
Blah blah blah

Several people laugh Cedric tries to maintain his
composure but the audience is slipping away He keeps
reading his hands sweating

( )

Cedric feels his throat tighten and he stops
already a failure

CEDRIC
In our high school years we have
learned great lessons that will serve
us well in the future Most
importantly we have learned to hold
tight to our dreams In class we read
a poem by Langston Hughes that begins
‘Hold fast to dreams for if dreams
die life is a broken winged bird

frowning back at him The silence is agonizing

so anxious for Cedric

Finally Cedric puts down his prepared text

CEDRIC (CONTD)
Hold fast to dreams Thats a hard
thing to do sometimes You have to
fight off the Dreambusters Thats
right Their favorite lines are You
cannot or You will not Many of us
have been called crazy or laughed at
for our dreams They tell us not to
shoot too high They tell us we
havent got what it takes to make it
in their world

In the audience he can see Phillip listening
stands in back stiff with anger Cedric grabs
the podium

The audience starts paying attention

Amen

CEDRIC (CONTD)

(louder)
But the enemy isnt always outside
Sometimes its one of us When one of
my peers found out I was going to
Brown she told me I wouldnt last two
years She said that because she was
jealous She was afraid of being left
behind She wished that I was staying
here with her But I have a different
wish I wish every one of us was
going to college so we could dream
bigger dreams The obstacles never
stop coming All of us have to fight
every day of our lives Because the
odds are stacked against us

The speech is
Cedric looks up at the sea of faces

Barbara is

You got that right Cedrics voice gets even
stronger now

CEDRIC (CONTD)

If we are ever gonna win those fights
we have to help each other not hold
each other back

(voice rising echoing

Bishop Long)
What we are up against in this world
the burden seems too heavy sometimes
Sometimes we feel so tired we feel
like we cant go on but thats when
weve got to turn to each other for
help We have to reach inside
ourselves for deeper inspiration We
have to keep our goal in sight Many
times we may want to quit But we
must remember the words of
Ecclesiastes The race goes not to
the swift nor to the strong but to he
who endurest to the end

People shout out encouragement Suddenly the auditorium is
being turned into a tent revival In back Mr Taylors eyes
shine

CEDRIC (CONTD)
All of us no matter what our goals
are up against the same thing Alone
we will be beaten But theres
nothing we cant handle together Our
refuge is with each other Yes Our
refuge is with each other and our
refuge is with God No one should be
left behind Together we will
survive and with Gods help we will do
more We will live out our dreams

The crowd erupts Its a total turnaround The sound is
thunderous Barbara jumps up screaming

the corner of her eye At the vans bumper Cedric stops

FLASH CUT A FINAL MEMORY

Its Cedrics first day of kindergarten Barbara slips the
house key around Little Cedrics neck

YOUNG BARBARA
Cedric honey you gonna do so good
Youre a little man now goin to
school

CUT FROM LITTLE CEDRIC TO

Barbaras strong tall grown-up son And suddenly Barbara
spreads her arms out wide

BARBARA
Come here

All the emotion theyve been fighting comes flooding out
They fall together as she presses her cheek hard against his
Everything theyve worked out is right here and right now
And yet at least for Barbara the moment is bittersweet

BARBARA (CONTD)
(whispers)
Trust in God Let Him guide you

( )

CEDRIC
I know Ma I will

They hug a good long time When they pull apart Barbaras
face is flushed

BARBARA
Okay now

She busies herself trying to hide her emotions reaches into
the back seat and gives him a Frito Lay assortment pack
uneaten from the trip She gets into the front seat He
stands by the window as she STARTS THE MOTOR then she
remembers something

BARBARA (CONTD)
Wait I forgot

She rummages in her purse and pulls out three neatly folded
20s She presses them into Cedrics hand

CEDRIC
Its too much

BARBARA
It aint near enough

Barbara squeezes his hand one more time and finally pulls
out Cedric turns and ambles back towards the dorm But
then the van stops

BARBARA (CONTD)
Wait

He turns She looks at him one last time

BARBARA (CONTD)
All right Bye

He waves walks off She watches in the rear view mirror
until he is out of sight

INT DORM ROOM - EVENING

Cedric walks in the dark room Rob isnt there He sits in
the window looking at the last blazing rays of the setting
sun Hes arrived in Oz and the world has gone from black
and white to brilliant Technicolor

In the gathering darkness Cedric starts to sing softly to
himself The song is Its So Hard to Say Goodbye to
Yesterday by Boyz II Men

( )

CEDRIC

‘How do I say goodbye to what we had
The good times that made us laugh
Ill want them back
I thought we get to see forever
But forevers gone away
Its so hard to say goodbye to

yesterday

INT VAN —- EVENING

The wheels hum The city lights come on And Barbara is
alone

CEDRIC (VO)
I dont know where this road is going
to lead
All I know is where weve been and
what weve been through
If we get to see tomorrow I hope its
worth all the wait

INT DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Cedric continues singing as Rob enters He listens
astonished to his new roommate

CEDRIC
‘Its so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And Ill take with me the memories to
be my sunshine after the rain
Its so hard to say goodbye to yesterday

And we leave these two boys in the soft darkness their story
to be continued as we

FADE OUT

THE END
