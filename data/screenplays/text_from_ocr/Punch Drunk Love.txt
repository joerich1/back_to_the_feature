thousand miles --

Do you realize that the monetary
value of this promotion and the

than the purchases

I saw your picture and I really
wanted to meet you

(beat)
I came to drop my car off there on
purpose to try and meet you
Barry leans a little bit out of FRAME

lying
LENA

-I thought I should tell you I
didnt want to get too far along on
going out and be hiding something --

BEAT He leans slightly back in FRAME

BARRY
Thats very nice Thank you Thank
you for saying that
(beat)
Youre friends with my sister

LENA

You didnt get along with her very
well

BARRY
Did you really come to meet me on
purpose or are you lying about that

LENA
No no I did

BARRY

Thats nice Its nice

(beat)
Ive been looking around a lot
lately at promotional giveaways
cross promotional work by some
companies Do you remember all that
pudding

LENA
Yeah
BARRY
So that pudding was bought I
bought that pudding because of a
pretty interesting promotion thats
sponsored by Healthy Choice and
American Airlines Its designed to
encourage airline travel and
obviously designed to encourage
buying Healthy Choice products
They make frozen meals deli meats
pasta sauce breads soups and ice
creams this sort of thing

LENA
Yeah

BARRY
Â»-Im sorryI lost my
thoughts what I was saying

LENA
You were talking about the
promotion --

BARRY

-- the promotion says buy any 10
Healthy Choice products and get 500
miles of airline travel or 1000
for purchases made with a special
coupon So in the supermarket you
notice their products first you
notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken
Dinner at 179 - thats a pretty
good dealbut then I noticed
they had soup at 89 cents a
can and you start to do the
math and you start to notice that
its a really amazing deal because
I stumbled across the pudding at 25
cents a cup Now the crucial thing
is the bar codes on the label
Thats those little bar codes you
know The universal product codes

LENA
Yeah

BARRY
Thats whats used to redeem the
mileage so in noticing the
pudding each cup had an individual
bar code -- in other words Two
dollars and fifty cents for ten
cups of pudding is 500 miles Add
in the coupon its one thousand
You see
LENA
Yeah

BARRY
You see

LENA
Yeah no I see --

BARRY
You see if you spent 3000 dollars
on pudding you could earn over one
million frequent flyer miles

LENA
Thats insane That is really
really crazy Thats just crazy if
you spend three thousand dollars on
pudding

BARRY
-yeah

LENA
So that was your pudding

BARRY

LENA
Im sorry I thought you said --

BARRY
No I didnt say that

LENA
I thought you said you bought all
that pudding --

BARRY

My friend Carlos is doing it who
works with me Its his Its his
pudding hes doing it Its not
mine Hes crazy I told him not to
do it Hes the one whos insane
He only spent about one hundred
dollars so far though --

LENA
Your sister was telling me a pretty
funny story about you when you
guys were kids and you were
building a ramp for your dog and
you threw a hammer through a window
Is that right You threw a hammer

I called a phone sex line before I
met you and then these four blond
brothers came after me and you got
hurt and Im sorry -- and I had to
leave because I dont want you to
get hurt again and now Im here and
Im back and I have a lot of
pudding that I can redeem in six to
eight weeks and if you give me that
much time I can get enough miles to
