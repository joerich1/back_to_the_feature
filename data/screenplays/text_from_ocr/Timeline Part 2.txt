Dont worry Were not going out that

Marek yanks the sheets off Oliver’s bed He uses his dagger to
slice a strip off the side of the sheet Then he cuts another

and another

His eye glances out the window to see Chris and the Professor at
the threshold of a doorway leading out into the courtyard Two
fully armored knights are standing between them and the front

Buc just theri he hears something Horses Galloping
Approaching

Then he sees the knights approaching Four of them -- led by
Black Plume

Marek yanks her in

MAREK
Can you swim

LADY CLAIRE
Yes Sut the current is strong

MAREK
Take my hand

They start floating down stream As they move toward the center
of the river the current gets stronger They move faster

Marek looks to the other side of the river Two more knights
Shit Nowhere to go No move to make

The knights just trot along the bank They’ve got all the time
in the world

Marek watches them Looks into Black Plumes eyes

LADY CLAIRE
Sir Andre--

He turns to look where she is pointing A few hundred yards
down the river there is a fortified bridge A mill is integrated
into the structure Several water wheels turn underneath the
bridge Passing between the wheels could be very dangerous

The current is picking up

LADY CLAIRE
What now

Marek stares at the water wheels At the bridge

MAREK
I have an idea

Black Plume eyes Marek from the river bank Next to the mill
bridge He motions for his men to enter the structure from both
sides

What are you doing rogue Whatever
it is I assure you it will be in
vain

The junior knight next to Black Plume looks over at him knows
his master speaks the truth

The river is all white water here Marek swims directly for one
of the water wheels

As he reaches it he grabs hold of the spokes then steps up onto
one of the paddles lifting Lady Claire with him

e INT MILL BRIDGE -- DAY

Marek and Lady Claire jump off the water wheel into a small dark
room They are dripping wet She is shivering fiercely

Marek leads her through a room full of two rows of trip-hammers
clanging loudly onto blacksmiths’ anvils This is a medieval
metal shop Whats odd is -- there’s no one here It gives the
place an eerie feel A sense of foreboding

The banging reverberates loudly off the stone walls

Suddenly a knight jumps out at Marek Their swords clank
together

Then he whispers the rest into her ear
Four knights are now in the room Swords drawn

The toughest meanest-looking knight swings his sword back and
forth in a complex pattern

MEANEST-LOOKING KNIGHT
Surrender your sword Or you will
surrender your head

Marek calmly reaches into his pouch and pulls out a tiny fire-
starting cube He holds it up to show che threatening knights

They look at him like he‘s nuts

Marek pulls the string out of the cube and carefully places it on
a low railing The knights watch the cube Then look back at
Marek Why does he have that smug expression on his face

Hes got to be nuts That’s the main thing they’re thinking

Until he grabs Lady Claire and literally throws her through a
small window in the wall behind them A split second later he
dives out after her

Marek looks at her into her eyes

The sounds of a metal door being opened Everyone stops
listens Footsteps now getting closer

A key placed in a lock -- turning CLANK And the door to their
cell swings open

Black Plume stands at the threshold
FIND John Gorden -- his eyes go wide at the sight --

His jaw drops open --

Black Plume draws his sword and thrusts it into Gordon’s belly--

Needless to say the Professor and Marek are pretty goddamned
stunned themselves

Black Plume removes his sword and Gordon collapses on the ground

him)

The guard unlocks Lady Claire and whisks her out

Black Plume kneels on the ground next to Gordon grabs him by the
hair and lifts his head so their eyes can meet

‘Gordon tries to say something A few raspy sounds But he has

no breath His lungs have been punctured
Slowly his eyes close Hes dead

that his speech is marked by the occasional odd pause strange
emphasis or intonation Something abour him is off You
can’t quite put your finger on it But you can sense it And

Its a fucking miracle I survived
The priest in Casteigard certainly
thought so And since French archers
had shot melets just say I had all
the credibility I needed with Oliver

They told us they’d never been more
than a hundred yards--

fades slowly into a look of hatred

De Kere puts his dagger to Marek’s throat

and cuts the marker from around his neck Then he takes the
Professor’s marker too

Are we really going to help Oliver
turn the tides against Arnaut
Oliver is supposed to die in the siege
of 1357 What if we help Oliver

live What if what we do means

Arnaut dies Were changing the

course of history It could God
knows what it could do to our world
Not that were ever getting back

Well get out of here Andre Believe
that

The Professor glances at his countdown clock It reads three
hours Three hours until their markers expire

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
And for the record Oliver will die
tonight Arnaut will win the siege
You know why Because he’s going to
catch Oliver off guard He’s going to

sneak his best knights into La Roque
through the secret passageway that
runs from that monastery right

there isn’t a noble family in all of

mean before we came here and mucked
around with history What happened to

smashing off the crenellations and dropping into the courtyard

A few feet away the Professor and Marek stand with Lord Oliver
and De Kere

Olivers troops have set up small catapults and primitive cannons
atop the battlements

THE PROFESSOR
Because he is not confined by a
fortress the enemy is able to build
larger catapults catapults with the
range to hit you while you are unable
to hit him with your small catapults

The Professor nods to one of Olivers troops who sticks a huge
metal arrow into a cannon and lights it

BOOM

There is a puff of black smoke and the arrow shoots out --
travelling only about halfway to Arnaut’s lines

THE PROFESSOR
Your cannons are likewise impotent
because your gunpowder does not
explode with sufficient force

Oliver Their eyes meet

mixture

of flame in all directions Arnaut’s catapult catches fire

Arnaut’s men arrive with buckets of water and begin dousing the
flames Only the water does nothing to quench the fire Rather
it seems to it

with each new dousing the flames leap higher Arnaut‘’s men step
back confused

In the end they just watch helplessly as the catapult burns to

The Chief Technologist stares down at his screen It reads
“protocol for disabling system -- executing” He looks at it
Stares at it

Then his hand reaches out and he clicks on the stop button” on
the screen

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
I can’t do it Bob

STERN
Do what

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
He asked me to disable the system To
leave your friends there

Stern turns to Doniger

STERN
You son of a bitch

And with that Stern punches Doniger in the face And for an

egghead it’s a damn good punch

Doniger drops

TRANSIT ROOM FLOOR TECHNICIAN (V0)

You are go to restart the machines

The Chief Technologist’s screen reads “re-initializingsystem

Doniger picks himself up off the ground

STERN
Get out

DONIGER
It’s my goddamn company

Stern with the help of the Chief Technologist shoves Doniger out
into the hallway They shut the door behind him In the hallway
we can see Doniger typing a code into the door-lock keypad

Nothing happens

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
I changed the code Bob Forget it

But the ax is so much heavier and has such momentum that it
almost knocks the sword right out of Marek’s hands

INT CASTLE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Oliver throws open a heavy oak doorto find Arnaut on the other
side of it

ARNAUT
I have often heard that the English
nobility havent the courage to stand

and much worse--

CLANG CLANG-CLANG

It is only probabilities but--

STERN
Only three are going to make it back

INT CASTLE HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Oliver and Arnaut clash in a spiral staircase Arnaut swings
hard Oliver parries but loses his footing and falls He
tumbles down the stairs

EXT BATTLEMENTS -- NIGHT

Things are going much worse for Marek Bleeding from his right
arm he is having trouble holding his sword with the intense grip
he needs to parry the tremendous momentum of De Kere’s double-

bladed ax

De Kere swings the ax down hard Marek puts his sword up
CLANG

And Marek’s sword goes flying It clatters along the stone
walkway and q see

ANGLE on Lady Claire’s face -- devastated

EXT SOUTH WALL -- NIGHT

Chris Kate and the Professor climb up to the parapet to see
that the French siege tower has caught fire

Kate shoves Chris hard He falls An arrow whizzes over his
head The group ducks for cover

Three English archers are holed up atop a nearby guard tower
They turn their attention from Chris and Kate back to the French
siege tower But before they can get another volley of arrows off
French soldiers scale the guard tower and strike them down

CHRIS
(re countdown
clock)
Three minutes We have to make a
decision right now

Chris looks at the siege tower Then at Marek He waves for
them to leave

MAREK
Go Youre almost out of time Go

KATE
We can’t leave you here

MAREK
Go

EXT BATTLEMENTS -- NIGHT

De Kere swings his ax back and forth forcing Marek back against
a wall

Marek looks over the edge The moat is six stories beneath him
and filled with spikes He looks at Lady Claire whose arms are
still tied behind her back

De Kere smiles Then brings the ax over his head-- No he
doesnt impale himself in the back like Chris had joked

He brings the ax down with incredible force Marek tries to roll

oo out of the way--

THUNK
Ahhhhh

EXT SOUTH WALL -- NIGHT

Near the French siege tower Chris Kate and the Professor are
looking over at Marek -- 50 feet away on another wall

t KATE
Oh Jesus--

She can‘t look She closes her eyes

But we FOCUS IN on the Professor On his eyes Suddenly the
look of horror in his eyes is replaced by a sense of wonder

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
My God--

EXT BATTLEMENTS -- NIGHT

Marek’s hand is against his head Blood is everywhere But he
isn’t dead He’s still moving

And when he removes his hand we see that he is missing his ear
102500 421

2 Marek looks up And the look in his eyes is like nothing weve
ever seen For he remembers ‘
“Bui « the knight with the missing ear the knight who married

‘

Lady Claire

De Kere looks at him trying to figure out where Marek‘s sudden
confidence is coming from

It rattles him De Kere swings THUNK Marek dives out of
the way pulling De Kere off balance as he does De Kere falls
He rolls over and pulls out his sword

Marek springs up and grabs the ax Ina single fluid motion he
swings it with all his weight at De Kere -- who is getting up off

the ground--
THUMP We hear the sound But we dont see it Blood
splatters Then we see De Keres headless body collapse on the
ground
A beat

Marek waves to them as they go toward the siege tower The
flames have now died out And the tower having served it’s
purpose for the French is now abandoned

dark There are four more powered up

Stern is already through the door and racing down the metal steps
that lead directly from the control room to the transit room

Chris and Kate hit their markers Their time machines slide
into view

EXT BATTLEMENTS -- LA ROQUE FORTRESS -- NIGHT
Marek cuts rope binding Lady Claire’s hands

Just as he does he looks out to see a flash of blinding white
light cut through the blackness of knight

He looks out at the night then turns back to Claire

THE PRESENT -- INT TRANSIT ROOM -- ITC CORPORATION
Doniger holds the gun on Stern in the transit room

DONIGER
Get out of my way

Stern stares at him dumbfounded

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
Are you crazy

Stern looks Doniger in the eye Then starts moving toward him

slowly deliberately

STERN
Give me the gun You don’t want to do
this Dr Doniger

BANG
A gunshot rings out Stern clutches his chest

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
Bob

Doniger turns the gun at the Chief Technologist

102500

But before he can get a shot off Stern dives into Doniger
knocking him to the floor

Stern blood oozing from his chest wrestles with Doniger holds
him down The chief technologist jumps into the fray

The struggle for several seconds before Doniger manages to break
free But he trips as he does and falls into the grenade-damaged
time machine Baretto returned in

Doniger aims his gun at the Chief Technologist But he’s not
quick enough --

Stern has already pressed the override button on the side of
Baretto’s machine

With a BLINDING FLASH and a SUCKING ROAR the time machine
activates Doniger screams as he is shrunk down toward the
floor When he’s gone Stern turns to the Chief Technologist

STERN
Is he coming back

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
If he doesthat machine was
broken The transcription errors
would

The Chief Technologist shudders at the thought An ITC
technician rushes out to Stern

TECHNICIAN
Dr Stern -- there‘’s an ambulance on
the way

Stern looks down at the wound It hit him at the very side of
his torso

STERN
I guess Id be dead already if it hit
anything too vital

Now suddenly there are three quick flashes

CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST
Your friends

And specks on the floor grow rapidly until we can see Chris
Kate and the Professor Full size

They are filthy spattered in dirt and mud nicked and cut all
over their bodies Their clothes are tattered And they look
absolutely exhausted On the verge of collapse

And they are in serious fucking pain from the time travel

Eres

102500 125

Chris steps out of his time machine Turns to Kate and the
Professor

CHRIS
(fighting the pain)
I don‘t know about you guys but
that’s the last field trip I’m going
to be taking for a while

Kate and the Professor cant help but chuckle Stern smiles

Then there is another flash On the pad Doniger left from
moments ago

Everyone turns to look at it

A shape grows quickly It takes a moment for us to realize
its a person It’s Doniger -- horribly deformed -- hideous--

Dead

Eyes close People cant look

PRESENT DAY -- EXT DORDOGNE VALLEY -- FRANCE -- DAY

Chris Kate the Professor and Stern enter a fourteenth century
abbey In the distance a half-mile away down the hill we can see
their original dig site

INT ABBEY -- DAY

The group looks at a stone tablet in the floor of the church
The inscription in French indicates “Lord and Lady Bujold’

We catch a few snippets from a modern historical interest placard
(in English) near the grave stone both died on the same
day widely respected during their long lives by commoners and
nobles alike five sons who went on to prominence patrons
of the arts who assisted a truly astounding list of early
renaissance artists

STERN
Do you think he was happy
The Professor laughs Chris and Kate smile Knowing smiles

PROFESSOR JOHNSTON
I’m sure of it
(beat)
Speaking of which

102500 126

The Professor has a glint in his eye as he turns to Kate He
looks her in the eye Then he looks at Chris Then back at
Kate -

Ana its clear that he knows exactly what’s been going on between
these two and he thinks it’s just fine

Caught totally off guard Kate turns crimson So does Chris

The professor breaks into a smile quite pleased with himself for
busting them like this

At the same moment Chris and Kate start stammering out an
explanation--

And we--
CUT TO BLACK
