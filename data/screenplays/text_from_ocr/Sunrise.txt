Sunrise

By

Alanna Smith
OPEN ON the moon gleaming like a silver coin in the sky

PAN DOWN to BENJAMIN a skinny Egyptian youth perched
in a window the moon reflected in his bright curious eyes
and a mouth that always looks moments away from a smile

Behind Benjamin is a room in the Cairo slums in the year
1800 filled with the huddled forms of sleeping children

Benjamin hears someone coming and pretends to be asleep
BENJAMINS UNCLE a gaunt man with oily hair and
complexion like candlewax leads TIA a young girl with
black hair and a small serious face to an empty corner of
the room Benjamin watches them with one eye cracked open

UNCLE
This is where youll sleep
Everyone earns their keep here
Your mother says you can sing

TIA
Yes sir
UNCLE
And if no one gives you money Do

you know how to take it (Tia nods)
Good You can stay as long as you
bring in coin Understand

TIA
I do sir

UNCLE
Then we should get along

As he walks away Tia realizes how cold it is

TIA
Sir could I have a blanket

He’s already gone Tia sinks into her corner shivering and
afraid but trying to put a brave face on it

Benjamin uncurls himself and steals over to Tia She shrinks
away as he crouches down in front of her

BENJAMIN
You’1l get used to my uncle he’s
not so bad I’m Benjamin What’s
your name
TIA
Tia

BENJAMIN
Tia Can I tell you a secret Tia
A secret I’ve never told anyone

Tia hesitates then nods

BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
I’ve met Ra

TIA
The sun god

BENJAMIN
The sun god

Tia seems to believe him then skepticism sets in

TIA
You haven’t met Ra

BENJAMIN
You’re right

He leans in with a grin and lowers his voice

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
I stole from Ra He walks the
streets at night with the sun ina
pouch I saw it shining on his belt
once and took a piece Just a
little piece He didn’t even know I
was there

TIA
You’re lying

BENJAMIN
Am I

Benjamin conjures tongues of flame that curl around his
fingers like ribbons Tia’s face lights up with wonder

TIA
How are you doing that What is it

BENJAMIN
It’s the sun Tia It’s my little
piece of the sun And it’s shining
for you
TIA
But won’t Ra come after you

Unnoticed Benjamin’s uncle watches in the doorway
transfixed Benjamin’s secret is discovered

BENJAMIN
That old bird can chase me all he
wants Tia He’ll never catch up

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT

1810 A garden in Suez Benjamin plays with a small flame in
his hand as he watches an older Tia and her husband through
the windows of the house above Tia carries a lantern

Benjamin’s eyes are red now the boyish curves of his face
sharpened He is 15 but looks older somehow Transformed

AMUN (VO)
You’re different now Benjamin

Benjamin closes his eyes and FLASHBACK TO INT CAVE - NIGHT

A desert cave A newly-transformed Benjamin sits ina
daze after his first feeding as AMUN a vulture-like older
man in a flowing red robe cleans blood off Benjamin’s face
and hands A mangled corpse lies on the ground behind them

AMUN (CONTD)
You belong with us now Your human
life has no place here And neither
does she

CUT BACK to the Suez garden Benjamin winces at the memory

A man steps out of the house Benjamin douses his flames
For a moment the light from the house illuminates Tia now
17 standing in the doorway She is radiant with long
midnight hair a calm intelligent face and faraway eyes

The man kisses her hand and leaves Benjamin breaks into a
brilliant smile

BENJAMIN
Tia

EXT CAIRO MARKETPLACE - DAY

FLASHBACK to five years earlier 1805 Benjamin stands on
the edge of a fountain in a crowded marketplace He’s 15
years old but this is be before his transformation His
eyes are dark brown and his face is still young and boyish

He spots Tia in the crowd wearing a hood to hide her
face and gives her a wink She rolls her eyes

Benjamin’s uncle struts in front of the fountain

UNCLE
Gather round Gather round and see
the miracle boy with fire in his
hands My nephew the boy who stole
sunlight from Ra himself

The crowd is unimpressed Then Benjamin begins dancing along
the edge of the fountain fire streaming from his hands and
spiraling into the air The crowd is awestruck

As he performs Tia sneaks through the crowd grabbing
purses from the watchers and stowing them in a sack
Eventually Tia gets too ambitious and goes for a larger
purse The man feels her take it and turns on her

MAN
(outraged)
Thief They’re thieves

Benjamin’s uncle flees without a second thought

Benjamin sends a burst of fire in the air and dives into the
rioting crowd After a few moments of chaos he finds Tia’s
hand and grabs it pulling her free of the marketplace They
run and laugh as coins spill from Tia’s overflowing sack to
glitter on the dusty street behind them

From a shadowy corner of the marketplace the hooded figure
of Amun watches them run

EXT GARDEN - NIGHT

CUT BACK TO Suez in 1810 Benjamin hears laughter and the
jingling of coins in his head as Tia goes back inside

Benjamin watches Tia’s lantern travel through the house
Then she stops silhouetted in a window facing the garden
Benjamin freezes It’s almost as if Tia senses him outside

For a long moment the night holds its breath

Finally Benjamin reaches out and conjures fire in his hand
The lantern in the window drops with a clatter and goes out

Moments later Tia bursts from the house and throws herself
into Benjamin’s arms They embrace like two halves of the
same whole reunited after an eternity apart

EXT CAIRO BACK ALLEY - DAY
FLASHBACK to 1805 moments after young Benjamin and Tia fled
the marketplace Benjamin and Tia huddle on the rooftop of a
slum house counting the coins Tia stole and giggling The
sun is setting behind the rolling hills of the desert

BENJAMIN
Were you even trying to be sneaky

Tia shoves him playfully

TIA
Oh stop If you were more
impressive no one would have
noticed

BENJAMIN
(grinning)
I’m always impressive (imitating
his uncle) I’m a miracle

TIA
A miracle that almost fell into the
fountain today Don’t think no one

saw

BENJAMIN
I have no idea what you’re talking
about

He suddenly remembers his uncle and frowns

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
I hope uncle got away

TIA
Don’t worry about him I’m sure he
didn’t worry about us

Benjamin laughs and lets the coins flow though his fingers

BENJAMIN
(mischevious )
Well maybe we should keep all of
this to ourselves then

As Tia watches the coins fall her smile fades

TIA
We could

BENJAMIN
(half-listening)
Hm
TIA
We could just tell him that we were
caught and lost the money

BENJAMIN
(startled)
What Why

Tia takes Benjamin’s hands and presses them lightly onto the
pile of coins Benjamin studies her face curiously

TIA
I don’t like how he uses you
Benjamin I don’t like how he uses
either of us

BENJAMIN
Uncle’s taken care of us

TIA
Because we’re useful to him But
II made a mistake today You’ve

seen what he’s done to children who
don’t make money Any day he could
decide that selling me is easier
than keeping me

BENJAMIN
He wouldn’t separate us

TIA
Are you sure Are you willing to
take that chance

Benjamin hesitates conflicted Then he looks at Tia’s
imploring face and his mind is made up He can’t lose Tia
He leans forward and presses his forehead to hers

BENJAMIN
No

TIA
Then I need you to promise me
something

EXT SUEZ STREET - NIGHT

CUT BACK TO Suez 1810 In the early hours of the morning
Benjamin and Tia walk through the shadowy streets of Suez
continuing a conversation that began in the garden near
Tia’s house Benjamin keeps a respectful distance
TIA
After you disappeared and Uncle
died I took our money back to my
mother But it wasn’t enough She
had to marry me off for a dowry

BENJAMIN
Are you safe with him Are you
happy

TIA

Of course I’m not happy Benjamin
you vanished For five years I
thoughtit’s so stupid

BENJAMIN
What

Tia tears up looking angry and embarrassed

TIA
I thought Ra caught up with you

BENJAMIN
(smiles softly)
No Not Ra

Tia gently touches Benjamin’s face

TIA
Then what What happened to you
Benjamin

Benjamin stops He gently takes her hand in his then takes
a step back letting their hands fall apart

BENJAMIN
(pained)
Someone took me because of my gift
Changed me into something else To
make me stronger

FLASHBACK TO EXT CAIRO STREET - NIGHT

1805 the night after the performance in the marketplace
went wrong Benjamin’s uncle hauls him by the arm through a
darkened street in the slums

UNCLE
(hissing)
Where’s the money Benjamin
BENJAMIN
(struggling)
I don’t know what you’re talking
about

UNCLE
Do you think I’m a fool I know
you’re covering for your little
friend Tia She’s always putting
ideas in your head (shakes
Benjamin) I could have ended up in
chains today because of her

BENJAMIN
You’re wrong Uncle Please stop
you’re hurting me

Benjamin’s uncle stops and pins Benjamin against a wall

UNCLE
Tell me where you hid the money

AMUN (0OS)
Pardon me

Amun emerges from an alley a slim figure in a hooded robe
radiating silent menace Benjamin’s uncle shoves Benjamin
and storms toward Amun jamming his finger at Amun’s chest

UNCLE
Can’t you see we’re busy

AMUN
Of course I just wanted to say

Amun grabs Benjamin’s uncle and hurls him across the street
Benjamin’s uncle crashes into the wall and drops unmoving

AMUN (CONTD)
-loved the show

He turns toward Benjamin who backs away horrified

BENJAMIN
What have you done

AMUN
You’1l understand soon

He steps toward Benjamin Benjamin’s hands ignite and he
lashes out at Amun Amun catches his wrist in an iron grip
Benjamin struggles to break free as Amun looks at the flames
in his hand with red hungry eyes
AMUN
It’s not a trick (smiles) You’re
going to change everything

BENJAMIN
You have to let me go Please I
made a promise (shouts) Tia Tia

Amun lunges at Benjamin with his teeth bared Blackout
CUT BACK TO EXT SUEZ STREET - NIGHT

1810 Benjamin tries to explain what happened that night but
his voice catches He looks down shakes his head Tia cups
his face in her hands and makes him meet her gaze

TIA (CONTD)
You can tell me I want to
understand

Benjamin sinks against a wall pained and uncertain

BENJAMIN
This man Amun took me away Hid
me He said there were others like
him who’d use me for my powers as
a weapon He’s been trying to
protect me from them

TIA
Protect you how What did Amun do
to you

The sun begins to rise streaking the street with amber

BENJAMIN
I’mnot human anymore Tia I
can’t go out in the sun and
Ifor so long I thought I was
going mad I had to stay away to
make sure I wouldn’t hurt you

TIA
Youd never hurt me

Benjamin tries to smile and fails The look on his face
breaks Tia’s heart She reaches out to him again

BENJAMIN
(sharply)
I drink blood Tia

TIA
(shrinks back)
Blood

Benjamin’s face crumbles He pushes away from the wall and
starts to stumble backward away from Tia

BENJAMIN
(stammering)
I’m sorry Amun was right He tried
to stop me from coming and I should

have let him I just wanted but
this was a mistake I’ll go I’m
sorry

Benjamin is so distressed as he backs away that he doesn’t
notice the ray of sunlight behind him

TIA
Benjamin stop Please The
sunlight you said--

Tia catches his arm before he can step into the light but
his other hand catches the sun and his skin glimmers like
crushed diamonds

Slowly wonderingly Tia takes his glistening hand in hers

TIA
A creature of night and still you
shine like the sun

Benjamin meets her gaze devastatingly vulnerable Tia makes
her decision

TIA (CONTD)
I want to know everything
Benjamin And then I want to come
with you

BENJAMIN
But it’s dangerous I have to go
back to Amun stay hidden I don’t
know what he’ll do if I bring you
back You’re still human

TIA
I don’t have to be Make me like
you You can do that can’t you

BENJAMIN
Yes but Tia you have a
husband A life

TIA
I didn’t choose my husband and my
life I chose the boy who told me
stories to chase off the dark I
chose you

Benjamin is still unsure Tia moves closer

TIA (CONT’D)
You promised me that if we got the
chance we’d run away together
You’ve never broken a promise to
me Are you going to start now

Benjamin’s smile can only stay away for so long It spreads
across his face again and he laces his fingers with hers

BENJAMIN
You always make things so simple

TIA
(smiles back)
I don’t know how you survived
without me

BENJAMIN
Neither do I

His smile turns shy

BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
Can you promise me something

Tia turns so she’s standing in the sun and Benjamin is in
darkness except for his glimmering fingers laced with hers

TIA
Anything

FLASHBACK TO Young Benjamin and Tia sitting on the edge of
the roof in Cairo looking out over the desert as the sun
sets their hands intertwined over a pile of gold

BENJAMIN (VO)
Promise I’1l never have to survive
without you again

TIA (VO)
I made that promise years ago I
just didn’t tell you

THE CAMERA SWEEPS past them and out into the desert as the
sunset becomes a sunrise Benjamin and Tia leave Suez and
walk toward the horizon hand in hand
