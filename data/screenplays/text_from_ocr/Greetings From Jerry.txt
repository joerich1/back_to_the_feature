EXT CITY STREET CORNER -- DAY

(MUSIC BAND OF HORSES THE FUNERAL)

A GROUP OF PEDESTRIANS stands waiting for the light to change
They represent a wide range of humanity--from the
BUSINESSWOMAN to the DELIVERY BOY the CONSTRUCTION WORKER

to the VAGRANT All appear to be miserableexcept for

THE HANDSOME YOUNG MAN IN THE DESIGNER SUIT standing front
and center doing a little dance Happiest guy in the world

This is JERRY (late 20s) We might not like him

A passing car zooms through a puddle soaking everyone but
Jerrywho miraculously remains bone dry

Everyone but Jerry staggers back from the curb stunned and
furious Jerry turns around offering a shrug and a smile

JERRY
Good things just happen to me

Then he GETS DRILLED BY A SPEEDING CAR THAT HOPS THE CURB
CRASHING HORRIBLY OS

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
They used to anyway All the time

(CHORUS KICKS IN)

TITLE CARD GREETINGS FROM JERRY

INT EMERGENCY ROOM - HALLWAY -- DAY

A pair of doors burst open and a TEAM OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL
PROFESSIONALS hurrying a gurney through as they urgently
attend to its passenger JERRY A BLOODY MESS

EACH DOORWAY the dying Jerry glances into as he rolls by it
shows not a hospital room but a GLIMPSE INTO HIS OWN PAST

JERRY (VO)
Some people have a hard time making
friends I never did

DOOR 1 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- SIX-YEAR-OLD JERRY
IS DANCING ON A DESK TO THE DELIGHT OF HIS CLASSMATES

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
But my social skills had no negative
effect on my academic performance
DOOR 2 SCHOOL AUDITORIUM -- NINE-YEAR-OLD JERRY PROUDLY
HOISTS A SPELLING BEE CHAMPIONSHIP TROPHY

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
He who exceeds in the classroom
flounders on the field of play right
Not in my case

DOOR 3 BASEBALL FIELD -- TWELVE-YEAR-OLD JERRY IS MOBBED
AT HOME PLATE AFTER A GAME-WINNING HOME RUN

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
And I never had much trouble
navigating the greatest obstacle in
the history of mankind

DOOR 4 HIGH SCHOOL HOUSE PARTY -- FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD JERRY
IS FEELING UP A GIRL ANOTHER GIRL TAPS HIM ON THE SHOULDER

TEENAGE FLASHBACK GIRL
Want to see if mine are better

CURRENT JERRY -- Vomits blood being rushed ahead into
INT EMERGENCY ROOM -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

DOCTORS and NURSES work feverishly to keep Jerry alive
affixing detaching and exchanging assorted medical devices

JERRY (VO)
I might very well have been the kind
of person you hate But let me say
in my defense that every good thing
I achieved in my life both large
and small was a result of absolutely
no effort on my part

Jerry violently convulses before his heart monitor FLATLINES

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
That probably didnt come out right

(END MUSIC)

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PLATTITUDES BUILDING -- DAY
An overdesigned hipper-than-thou structure on a needlessly

expansive stretch of property A sign at the front drive
bears the logo of PLATTITUDES - GREETINGS WITH ATTITUDE
INT PLATTITUDES - HALLWAY -- DAY

Jerry (A FEW YEARS YOUNGER than when we last saw him MID-
20S) steps up to a closed office door Behind him is MUG
(mid-20s)--unassuming and gentle perpetually ill-at-ease

MUG
Can I tell you a secret

About to open the door Jerry stops

MUG (CONTD)
Im kind of nervous

JERRY
Can I tell you something obvious
You need better secrets
(extends fist)
Lets do this

Mug high-fives Jerrys fist-bump Jerry opens the door into--
INT PLATTITUDES - SETHS OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Jerry hop-steps and chucks a rubber ball at a CO-WORKER
knocking the Xbox controller out his hands this is PHILIP
(mid-20s)--loud and boisterous eager to please

Mug throws his own ball across the room at SETH (mid-20s)--
hipster-geek cool casually confident--whos working at his

desk The ball goes wide knocking over a lamp

JERRY
Two-on-one Seth Philips out

PHILIP
I thought we were on break

JERRY
There are no breaks in Throwball

SETH
My lamp looks pretty broken

JERRY
Ill give you a free shot at Mug

MUG
Hey

PHILIP
Take it like a man
SETH
I dont want to play

JERRY
So youre conceding

SETH
Yes You and Mug can be the all-
time office dodgeball champions

JERRY
Its not dodgeball its Throwball
Dodgeball implies escape and
empowers the victim

MUG
Throwball favors the strong

JERRY
And we are the all-time champions

Jerry extends a fist which Mug high-fives

JERRY (CONTD)
Really

PHILIP
All-time going back to when you
invented the gamethis morning

JERRY
Technically last night

SETH
At any point while you were hammering
out the games myriad details did
you get a chance to work on the
proposal for the new series that you
were supposed to turn in this morning

JERRY
No

MUG
Bleep gave you more time

JERRY
No I worked the ideas out on the
drive to work today and gave them to
Fat Asshole first thing

PHILIP
Bullshit
SETH
Theres no way thats going to fly

In the doorway appears FAT ASSHOLE (30s)--the guys boss

FAT ASSHOLE
Hey douchebags Im treating us
all to a liquid lunch today And
maybe if youre lucky Jerry will
give the rest of you free advice on
how to do your fucking jobs
(to Jerry)

One of the best proposals Ive ever
seen J-Dog The whole series is a

go

Fat Asshole ducks back out of the room and everyone turns
to glare enviously at Jerry Seth flings a ball past him

JERRY
Oh now you want to play

EXT CITY STREETS -- DAY
(MUSIC DOES IT OFFEND YOU YEAHS WE ARE ROCKSTARS)

A line of brand-new luxury vehicles snakes its way through
traffic at unsafe speeds

JERRY (VO)
I had a very easy insanely high-
paying job and I owed it all to the
friends I made in college

AT THE WHEEL OF THE MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE IS SETH

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Seth was the one who started it all
He was always a hustler and he had
the job at Plattitudes lined up even
before our senior year He made his
name in the peer-to-peer teenage
market and opened the door for the
rest of us

DRIVING THE CADILLAC ESCALADE IS PHILIP

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Philip followed Seth and what he
lacked in seniority he quickly made
up by carving himself the biggest
slice of pie in the greeting card
industry immediate-family birthdays
(MORE)
JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
He might not have been the most
creatively challenged but he was
the top earner out of all of us

RIDING SHOTGUN WITH PHILIP IS MUG

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Nobody was quite sure how it happened
but Mug ended up cornering the market
on pet cards cards to people from
their dogs cards to dogs from other
peoples cats cards congratulating
people when their cats and their
dogs have kittens and puppies Youd
be surprised how well those things
sell You might also want to be
depressed by itbut good for Mug

JERRY DRIVES THE BMW M6

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
I was the all-purpose romance guy
The cards could be funny the cards
could be sadbut no matter what
they always read as completely
heartfelt and genuine Truth be
told I was just a softie at heart

INT JERRYS NICE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Nice new fixtures nice new furniture nice new plasma TV
An enviable bachelor pad

JERRY (0S)

(building in intensity)
Im a happy person with happy things
Im a happy person with happy things
Im a happy person with happy things

INT JERRYS NICE APARTMENT - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Jerrys in bed banging away at a FEMALE ESCORT
JERRY
(approaching climax)
Im a happy person with happy things
Im a happy per Happy Things

Fin Jerry rolls off of the escort spent She sits up and
hangs her legs over the side of the bed lighting a cigarette

ESCORT 1
Do you always say that during sex

JERRY
(genuinely unaware)
What was I saying

A SECOND ESCORT appears on the other side of Jerry her
attention on an end table

ESCORT 2
Hey can I finish this coke

JERRY
Knock yourself out

While the escort sets up lines of cocaine for herself and
her colleague Jerry reaches into an end table drawer He
produces a check register and a pen

ECU CHECK REGISTER -- The pen records a debit of 2000but

pauses at the DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION column
JERRY -- Thinks for a moment

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
When you think of highly lucrative
careers greeting card writer
probably isnt at the top of your
list

ECU CHECK REGISTER -- Jerry writes in RESEARCH

JERRY (V0O) (CONTD)
Thats where Fat Asshole comes into

play
EXT CITY STREETS -- DAY
Back to the RACING LUXURY VEHICLES

JERRY (VO)

In a world that made sense a
brainless degenerate of his vile
sort would be lucky to live off of
pre-owned urinal cakes But the
world does not make sense

Taking the lead is a HUMVEE with FAT ASSHOLE at the wheel
swigging from a flask and HOWLING like a drunken frat boy

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
So Fat Asshole of course happened
to have been sired by the billionaire
CEO of one of the most powerful media
conglomerates in the world

11A

FREEZE FRAME

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Smart enough to not put his jerkoff
son in charge of anything important
daddy created a whole new offshoot
for the sole purpose of keeping Fat
Asshole busy and out of jail Thus
was born

OMITTED 11
INT PLATTITUDES - LOBBY -- DAY 11A

Fat Asshole is addressing a CROWD from a podium standing
beneath A BANNER DEBUTING THE PLATTITUDES LOGO

JERRY (VO)
The Plattitudes Greeting Company A
meaningless branch with endless funds

FAT ASSHOLE
The extra T is for ‘attitude’

JERRY (VO)
God bless America

IN THE AUDIENCE -- Jerry Seth Philip and Mug celebrate
Mug is botching all the fist-bumps with attempted high-fives

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Provided that you believe in neither

CUT TO
INT VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT 12

Jerry Seth Philip and Mug are in a booth throwing back a
few happy hour drinks Mug raises a toast

MUG
To Jerry The man of the hour

PHILIP
And bleeps current golden boy

JERRY
Fuck that fat asshole It wasnt
that long ago when he was dropping
hints he was going to fire me if my
cards didnt start selling

The guys drink their drinks and set down their glasses As
if on cue Philips cell phone RINGS

PHILIP
Whup Thats the old ball and chain

He stands and moves away from the table answering the call

JERRY (VO)
When a guy refers to his significant
other as the old ball and chain
hes usually being sarcastically
affectionate But in Philips case
his girlfriend was as close as a
human being could get to actually
taking the form of steel

A WHITE FLASH AND CLICK INTRODUCE

AN INSERT SEQUENCE OF PHOTOGRAPHIC SLIDES 13

SLIDE 1 depicts PHILIP and his UNPLEASANT GIRLFRIEND sitting
on a couch He is smiling for the camera while she is looking
out of frame at something in ugly annoyance

literally the day before he got rich
from his first big commission
Whenever he would indulge the
occasional doubt about his
girlfriends commitment

CLICK SLIDE 2 depicts a BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR PHILIPS
UNPLEASANT GIRLFRIEND Shes surrounded by a smiling PHILIP
and OTHERS (including JERRY and MUG) piles of gifts anda
beautiful cake in front of her Shes smoking disinterested

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Hed take solace in the fact that
she was technically with him before
he hit it big Like she deserved
credit for sticking with him through
the hard times--those twelve hours
when all he had to live on was his
trust fund

CLICK SLIDE 3 depicts PHILIP and his UNPLEASANT GIRLFRIEND
on BOURBON STREET DURING MARDI GRAS Hes overjoyed she
looks like shes waiting in line at the DMV

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Philip would never be anything more
to her than a warm body and an
increasingly fat bank account
(MORE)

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Deep down we all knew it but none
of us had the balls to say it to his
face None of us including Philip
was ever much good at confrontation
Or truth

A WHITE FLASH AND CLICK TAKE US BACK TO
INT VAGUELY IRISH BAR -- NIGHT

Philip salutes Jerry and Seth before departing with Mug
Jerry gets up and takes a seat across the table from Seth
balancing out the abandoned side of the booth

JERRY

Seth laughs busted he puts away his phone

DAPHNE
Howd that work out

JERRY
Me think us both be talk good now

DAPHNE
I mean how did you get from one thing
to the other

JERRY
(gestures to Seth)
Thats a question for the social
climber He had the connections I
just went along for the ride

DRUNK FRIEND
Youre a social climber

SETH
Offensive notion Suggests that Im
not already at the top

Drunk Friend laughs too loudly again
DAPHNE

(to Drunk Friend)
Come to the bathroom with me

her

The girls slide out of the booth and move off Jerry and

Seth wait the cursory five seconds before talking

direction

JERRY
Bless your misogynistic heart

INT JERRYS BMW -- NIGHT

Daphne and Jerry are making out in the car which is parked
in the street outside DAPHNES APARTMENT BUILDING Daphne
pulls away but stays close her eyes filled with lust

DAPHNE
Yeah I think I have to go inside
(off Jerrys look)
I mean by myself

JERRY
Wow For future reference There
are several much less suggestive
ways to deliver that previous line

DAPHNE
Maybe you could show me how to do it
in a greeting card

JERRY
Ouch Ouch

DAPHNE
(laughs)
Im just jealous because your job is
cooler than mine

JERRY
Whats not cool about being a banquet
waitress

DAPHNE

Har har You dont talk like a
greeting card writer you know You
havent said a cheesy thing all night

JERRY
You doubt my capacity for cheesiness

DAPHNE
Show me what you got

They separate Jerry takes a moment to get into character

JERRY
With so much unknown in life the
only promise worth anything is the
one made blindly
(dramatic turn)
Promise me Daphne

DAPHNE
Promise you what

JERRY
Promise what you dont know

DAPHNE
(beat amused)
Okay I promise

JERRY
(drops act gloating)
You just promised to give me your
phone number

DAPHNE
Oh burn Guess what though

Daphne reaches into her purse producing a scrap of paper

DAPHNE (CONTD)
I wrote it down an hour ago

She hands the paper to Jerry kisses him several times
quickly and skoots out of the carleaving Jerry LAUGHING

CUT TO
INT PLATTITUDES - CONFERENCE ROOM -- MORNING
A VIDEO MONITOR is playing in the otherwise DARKENED ROOM

ON THE MONITOR A YOUNG WOMAN stands in a kitchen having
just discovered a very well-lit GREETING CARD Reading it
she is moved to tears She looks up to see her apologetic-—
looking BOYFRIEND OR HUSBAND in the doorway

COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER (VO)
The words are already in your heart
We just connect them to hers

As the happy couple embraces the PLATTITUDES LOGO appears

As THE LIGHTS COME UP in the room A SMATTERING OF APPLAUSE
rings out Jerry Seth Philip and Mug are seated around a
table with Fat Asshole who now rises

FAT ASSHOLE
That spot starts airing in every
major market next week just before
the second printing of Jerrys
phenomenal male-to-female general
romance series hits the shelves

He initiates ANOTHER ROUND OF APPLAUSE one that Jerry
abstains from expressing bashful thanks to his friends

FAT ASSHOLE (CONTD)
The rest of you abortions go and see
if you come up with something half
as good as that

The guys begin to file out of the room Jerry last

FAT ASSHOLE (CONTD)
J-Dog I want to talk to you in my
office Im about to make your year

INT PLATTITUDES - FAT ASSHOLES OFFICE -- LATER 18

In the enormous office Fat Asshole sizes up Jerry from across
his enormous desk

JERRY (VO)
There were many things that I disliked
about Fat Asshole But the one thing
that I hated above all else was his
goddamn word-a-day desk calendar

POV JERRY FAT ASSHOLES DESK CALENDAR

FAT ASSHOLE
The fact is J-Dog youre in the
zone right now Youre getting things
done

JERRY (VO)
What bothered me wasnt that he owned
one that he bought himself a new
one every Christmas

FAT ASSHOLE
I look at you and I can see the gears
turning in your head Youre bursting
with ideas

TODAYS WORD IS PARTURIENT (adj) -- About to bring
forth young being in labor Of or relating to giving
birth About to produce or come forth with something
such as an idea or a discovery

JERRY (VO)
It wasnt even that he spent every
day forcing that days word into
every conversation as many times as
possible

FAT ASSHOLE
Youre parturient with them

JERRY (VO)
What really drove me insane was that
Fat Asshole would never without
fail have any recollection whatsoever
of the previous days word

Jerry glances at Fat Assholes trash can Though the previous
days page is crumpled he can still make out MUNIFICENT

JERRY (CONTD)
Thats munificent of you to say

Fat Asshole stares blankly unfamiliar with that word

FAT ASSHOLE
I want to capitalize on your hot
streak J-Dog How would you feel
about tripling your commission rate

JERRY
Id feel pretty good about it

FAT ASSHOLE
Then lets take your parturient skills
on the romance end and apply them
bereavement and Spanish

Jerry stares at Fat Asshole unable to compute

JERRY
Bereavement and Spanish

FAT ASSHOLE
Romance is covered--its out there
its selling But the marketplace
is parturient with customers who are
dying and speaking and Spanish--some
people are doing both--and were not
reaching them I need you to work
your magic on those two markets
(beat )
Whaddya say Jerry Are you my boy

Jerry holds his look on Fat Asshole his confidence wavering
for just a moment

JERRY (VO)
When I was a kid and my father had a
new book to promote hed always
bring us with him on the one leg of

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
the trip that took him from where we
lived then to where I live now

JERRY (CONTD)
(delayed grin)
You bet

DISSOLVE TO
EXT WATERFRONT PIER -- DAY 19

A MASSIVE CROWD packs every inch of this tourist trap that
boasts something for everyone restaurants carnival rides
a central arcade and so on

Just outside the arcade a THRONG OF CHILDREN is mesmerized
by a PUPPET SHOW Within the stage two hand puppets have
their puppet hands stuffed with candy

PUPPETEER (0S)
Who wants candy

The children all SCREAM for the treats raising their arms

in the air Among them is a SIX-YEAR-OLD JERRY his hand as
high as anyones Next to him is his father GERALD (40s)--
Clark Gable handsome impossibly both masculine and refined

JERRY (VO)
My legal name was ‘Jerry--it wasnt
short for Gerald which was my
fathers name That was the one and
only decision in my fathers life
that he left to my mother He spent
every day that followed refusing to
acknowledge that it ever happened

GERALD
Put your hand down Gerald You
look like a homosexual

Six-Year-Old Jerry lowers his arm heartbroken Unconcerned
Gerald takes a ponderous drag of his Chesterfield

EXT WATERFRONT -- A SHORT WHILE LATER 20

Six-Year-Old Jerry reluctantly follows his father along the
shoreline growing progressively further from the fun pier
Gerald carries an ornately designed cane as he walks

JERRY (VO)
For most of my life my father walked
around with a cane that he didnt
(MORE )

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
need for any physical reason He
prided himself on being a
distinguished man and as such he
believed that a cane reinforced the
impression to any objective observer

Six-Year-Old Jerry reacts with embarrassment as A GUY INA
WHEELCHAIR rolls past in the opposite direction

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
I thought it made him look like a
douchebag

Gerald comes to a gradual stop turning to face the water

GERALD
Infinity Gerald Its what we all
want to achieve

Six-Year-Old Jerry gazes longingly at the distant pier

JERRY (VO)
All I wanted was some candy

INT MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - STAGE -- MORNING

Gerald sits on a couch being interviewed on-air by the CHEERY
FEMALE HOST and CHEERY MALE HOST

CHEERY FEMALE HOST
Your latest book is titled The
Magellan Cipher and it features
the return of your very popular
recurring character Professor Desmond
Booker What made you decide to
write another Booker adventure

GERALD
I find myself coming back again and
again to the Booker character because
to be honest Im mysteriously
obsessed with him

BEHIND THE CAMERAS -- While the interview continues Six-
Year-Old Jerry is standing by the craft services table
staring down an unappealing spread of vegetables

A CUTE PA GIRL (20s) is ostensibly watching over him
staring starry-eyed at Gerald

CUTE PA GIRL
Your daddy is a genius
(MORE)

CUTE PA GIRL (CONTD)
I love every one of his books I
know theyre too grown up for you
right now but when you start reading
them youre going to find out how
lucky you are

JERRY (VO)
What I would find out is that I was
the son of an author of highly
forgettable glorified airport novels
whose plots usually dealt with paper-
thin government conspiracies leading
to races against time and whose
dialogue and characterizations were
piss-poor across the board

INSERT A CRASH ZOOM PROMOTIONAL SHOT OF THE MAGELLAN CIPHER --
A DESMOND BOOKER ADVENTURE

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
I would also find out that my fathers
obsession with his most frequently
recurring character Professor
Desmond Booker often described as--

INSERT ECU A PASSAGE FROM THE MAGELLAN CIPHER MATCHING

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
A rakish intellectual with salt-and-
pepper hair and a masculine jawline
the distinct contours of his muscular
build visible even beneath his high-
necked sweater and corduroy blazer--

INSERT A FULL-COLOR JACKET PHOTO OF GERALD -- His hair
salt-and-pepper his jawline more or less masculine dressed
in a high-necked sweater and corduroy blazer

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
Was perhaps not so mysterious

INT MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - HALLWAYS -- LATER 22

Six-Year-Old Jerry is wandering the hallways grossly
unattended and completely lost

GERALD (0S)
(quietly muffled)
Im a happy person with happy things
Im a happy person with happy things

Six-Year-Old Jerry follows the sound of his fathers voice
which leads him to a closed dressing room door

GERALD (0S) (CONTD)
Im a happy person with happy things

Without hesitation Six-Year-Old Jerry pushes the door open--
INT MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - DRESSING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

To find himself staring at his fathers naked ass pants
around his ankles as he bangs away at the Cute PA Girl

GERALD
Im a happy person with happy things

Neither one of them notices Six-Year-Old Jerry they just
keep going at it Little Jerry just stares perplexed

JERRY (VO)
My mother never came with us on the
promotional tours

INT JERRYS NICE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

Daphne crosses the room from a bookshelf to a console table
a large hardcover book in hand She looks between the book
jacket and something on the table then smiles to herself

Jerry emerges from the kitchen carrying a couple of after-
dinner drinks

JERRY
That food we brought home is just
going to sit in my fridge until it
breeds You should really take it

DAPHNE
Looking at the rest of your books I
couldnt figure out why you had so
many by this guy--they dont fit in
But I just solved the mystery

She holds up the book jacket photo of Jerrys dad comparing
it to a framed photo on the console table of HIM WITH JERRY
AT A GRADUATION CEREMONY

DAPHNE (CONTD)
This guys your daddy

Jerry takes the book from Daphnes hand closing it
JERRY

I hope you dont think any less of
me

DAPHNE

(beat backpedaling)
Not that that means a damn thing

JERRY
(laughs)

He returns the book to its place on the shelf

DAPHNE
Those all the books he ever wrote

Jerry nods

JERRY
Lucky for him

DAPHNE
I dont want to boil your rabbit

Unless you want me to

JERRY

DAPHNE

something That you and I

(off Jerrys look)
Okay see See You know what Im

you for everything I will see you

Daphne tries to hurry out but Jerry stops her

she backs away moving out of the apartment and into the
night Jerry watches her go all the way

PHILIP
You wouldnt have enough to go on

JERRY
He told potential employers that I
was a drug addict

Jerry picks up the table following the woman to her car

PHILIP
But you would have to prove that
that is specifically what prevented
you from getting any of those jobs

MUG
Yeah If you tried to say that
werent a drug addict bleep could
point out that you had been in rehab

The Uptight Woman stops on a dime wheeling around
UPTIGHT WOMAN
No Im not going to support your
habit I dont want the table
Jerry Mug and Philip stare in shock at the woman
UPTIGHT WOMAN (CONTD)
I was going to get the Ab Roller
too but forget it
MUG

Jerry turns to Mug rendered speechless by his own anger

UPTIGHT WOMAN

MUG

The Uptight Woman hands Mug cash and takes an Ab Roller
off the table She sneers at Jerry as she walks past

UPTIGHT WOMAN
Get a job addict

Jerrys eyes of fury remained locked on Mug

careens of the road and right into an oak tree its entire
front end instantly demolished

Mugs car pulls up to a stop behind Jerrys and Mug jumps
out The nun has remained completely unaware of the incident
finishing her shuffle across the road towards a CHURCH

Mug runs up to the wrecked BMW to find Jerry bleeding from
the head and looking dazed fighting the deployed airbag

Through the large front window of the magnificent house we
see Jerrys crumpled car sitting dead in the driveway as a
tow truck is driving off

Jerry--pressing a cold compress to his head clearly suffering
from a mild concussion--and Mug are seated on a couch Facing
them from across a coffee table are SUMMER --in the flesh
BAWLING uncontrollably--and her ANGRY FATHER (50s)

ANGRY FATHER
Just to get you fucking criminals
out of my house Im going to buy
whats left of the car for a thousand

From his pocket he produces a fat roll of hundred-dollar-
bills counts out ten and drops them on the coffee table

JERRY
(slurred)
Were not criminals I was only in
rehab ‘cause of the DUIs

Mortified Mug snatches the bills and gets to his feet

MUG
Lets go Jerry

JERRY
Wait A thousand dollars Thats
likea fortieth of the price we
agreed on

ANGRY FATHER
Since youre so good at math why
dont you figure out how much its
gonna cost me to get that thing back
to working condition

Disinterested Jerry lets his eyes settle on the nubile
Summer His grin is delirious and entirely unsavory

JERRY
Im a happy person with happy things

With that Jerry pitches forward--knocking his head on the
coffee table--and falls onto the floor unconscious

He flips the card over to check the signature on the back
finding that it reads ACE

He eventually finds himself in THE GREETING CARD AISLE

out and a little tipsy--are perusing the cards

God they dont have shit here

Whats the occasion

The girls pause briefly but are drunk enough themselves to
indulge Jerry in conversation

GREETING CARD GIRL 2
Her anniversary with her fiancé

GREETING CARD GIRL 1
I already got him a gift and
everything but the cards kind of a
big deal this year ‘Cause weve
been together for like a really long
time and ever since we got engaged
weve both been kind of worried that
like the magics gone Yknow what
I mean But all theyve got left
are these blank cards

JERRY
You got a pen

GREETING CARD GIRL 2
I do

Girl 2 digs into her purse producing a pen

JERRY
(to Girl 1)
Use that blank card youre holding
write this down General salutation
name On Our X Anniversary

Girl 1 is confused but writes as dictated

JERRY (CONTD)
The day that I met you was one of
the greatest days of my life It
was when I first began to dream of
how exciting my life could be
And I would never want to go back to
it

The girl takes pause but writes what Jerry says

JERRY (CONTD)
Because if I did I would miss every
day that Ive lived sincewhen
youve made that dream come true

The girls look at each other duly impressed

JERRY (CONTD)
Heres to our life together and may
I never sleep again happy
anniversary love--your name

cards for a living

At the end of the aisle behind Jerry appears a SECURITY GUARD

DRUGSTORE SECURITY GUARD
Sir I think you better leave the
store

Jerry wheels around redirecting his rant without pause

JERRY
But is that what I got fired for
No I never got called out on that
You know what I got fired for
Spanish and bereavement cards Thats
what I went out on That was the
end of Jerry Un-fucking-believable

cares about Spanish and bereavement
cards

The guards eyes briefly dart to a section of cards Jerry
follows his gaze to a DIVIDER THAT READS SYMPATHY - SPANISH

dragging a pile of cards with him as he falls to the ground

GREETING CARD MOCK-UP on which Jerry is working

KID ON PLANE
Whats your job

JERRY
I write greeting cards

KID ON PLANE
Like birthday cards

JERRY
Sometimes

KID ON PLANE
Is that a birthday card

JERRY
No This is a very special kind of
card Nobodys ever made one like
it before

KID ON PLANE
What kind is it

JERRY
A suicide card

That gets the attention of the TWO PEOPLE sitting on either
side of Jerry

KID ON PLANE
Whats suicide

JERRY
Its when you kill yourself

KID ON PLANE
No way

JERRY
Way A lot of times when people
kill themselves they leave a note
for other people to read explaining
why they did it They want these
notes to be unique poetic and
emotionally impactful But the
problem Billy is that people are
stupid

KID ON PLANE
My names not Billy

JERRY
Your average American cant string
together a coherent sentence never
mind effectively convey any kind of
genuine emotion via the written word
Since the dawn of the greeting card
industry people have turned to it
to speak for them on birthdays
anniversaries for get-wells and
apologies So why have they taken
matters into their own hands when it
comes to arguably the most important
thing theyll ever say--their last
words More or less religious-based
moral hypocrisy is why Billy but
thats a much larger issue

KID ON PLANE
My names Tyler

JERRY
I say no more As a professional
and--at one time--rather accomplished
greeting card writer Im smashing
the only taboo in the business and
opening the floodgates to a previously
untapped and potentially very
lucrative market What youre looking
at is the prototype for the first-
ever mass-produced suicide card

KID ON PLANE
What does it say

JERRY
Since it is a prototype Im sticking
to primarily generic yet poignant
language But like on any card
therell be plenty of space for the
customer to fill in the blanks
Yknow My existence is cursed
Theres no sense in fighting it
Im pushing thirty and I have to
move back into my fathers house I
had ask my sister to buy me the plane
ticket just so I could do that
That kind of stuff

KID ON PLANE
Is it going to make you rich

JERRY
Its going to make somebody rich

A FLIGHT ATTENDANT leans across Jerrys row to hand a snack
box to the OVERWEIGHT MAN in the window seat

I almost threw that out with your
latest backlog Looks like a wedding
invitation

JERRY
Yeah My friend Philip Im supposed
to be a groomsman

GERALD
Supposed to

JERRY
Im not sure if Im going

Jerry glances out the front window noticing a TEENAGE STONER
loitering at the edge of the lawn Gerald sees him too

GERALD
You should I have a feeling you
could get the time off
Gerald moves off Jerry looks puzzledthen concerned

INT JERRYS FATHERS HOME - GARAGE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

Jerry is tossing aside boxes in a panic digging to get to
his marijuana stockpile He reaches where it should be

And finds AN EMPTY SPACE Gerald trashed the stash

JERRY

Mother fucker

INT JERRYS FATHERS HOME - STORAGE ROOM -- NIGHT

Jerry is on the phone glassy-eyed with a tumbler of Scotch
in hand His printer is slowly churning out a document

ANGRY COLD-CALL CUSTOMER (0S)

JERRY
What if you had to use a payphone
Are your coins organized enough for
that kind of situation

The line goes dead just as Jerrys printer finishes

THE SUICIDE CARD IN ITS COMPLETED FORM ITS HEADING READS
LETS SHARE THE BLAME

INT JERRYS FATHERS HOME - MASTER BEDROOM -- DAWN 133B

All is quiet save for the RHYTHMIC MECHANICAL BREATHING
of Geralds negative pressure ventilator inside of which
Gerald currently sleeps

Standing over him is Jerry out of his mind

JERRY
You look at me like Ima
disappointmentlike I never became
the man you are Ive got news for
you Dad Im exactly the man you
are I took the first thing that
came easy to me and made an
unreasonably good living at it Im
well aware that my contribution to
the world was absolute bullshit So
was yours Deep down inside that
little black heart of yours I think
you might even know that But heres
where our lives differ I will not
ignore the fact that the jig is up
I tried to keep coasting for a while
surebut it just wouldnt take
You called it--props for that Props
also for your capacity for self-
delusion that has allowed you to
live with your head in the sand for
fucking decadesanother talent I
did not inherit

Jerry raises a BOTTLE OF CARPET SHAMPOO

JERRY (CONTD)

Thats why Im checking out

(removes cap beat)
But I wouldnt feel right doing myself
in without first setting my house in
order--or in this case yours Im
going to do something for you Dad
that you should have done for yourself
a long time ago

(contemplative pause)
I guess Ill see you in hell

Jerry leans down and unplugs the ventilator Then he
straightens up and chugs the entire contents of the bottle
133C

Butthe ventilator is STILL BREATHING And--for the
first time--we realize that there HAD BEEN ANOTHER SOUND
occurring in the background One that has suddenly STOPPED

THE LIGHTS POP ON as Venezuela from Venezuela enters the
room looking puzzled

VENEZUELA FROM VENEZUELA
Mister Jerry Why you unplug vacuum

Jerry pulls the empty bottle away from his lips chemical
foam bubbling from his mouth Stunned he looks at the still-
plugged-in ventilator then back at Venezuela from Venezuela

JERRY

Jerry keels over and dies

INT JERRYS OCEANSIDE MANSION - MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY

Jerry blinks awake finding himself tucked into imported
Italian sheets on what looks like the most comfortable bed
in history Everything--including Jerrys silk pajamas--is
PRISTINELY WHITE interrupted only by the SPARKLING BLUE
WATER seen through the enormous window

Daphne--looking like the sexiest woman alive--is sitting on
the edge of the bed having nudged Jerry out of his slumber

DAPHNE
Think you slept long enough

JERRY

(overwhelmed)
Oh my god Daphneyou would not
believe the dream I had My life
was just one disaster after
anotherI was a total failure At
the end I killed myself by drinking
carpet shampoo

total failure

EXT JERRYS OCEANSIDE MANSION - PATIO -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

There are patios and then there are patios Jerrys isa
sprawling multilevel veranda ending in an infinity pool
that overlooks the beach below

Jerry and Daphne step out into a LOW-KEY PARTY in progress
All the HAPPY AND GOOD-LOOKING ATTENDEES REACT in unison to
Jerrys appearance raising their glasses in salute As

Daphne leads Jerry through the crowd FAMILIAR FACES pop up

PHILIP
Nice of you to make it to your own
party Jerry

MUG
Dude the shrimp is really good I
keep telling myself Im going to
stop eating it when you run outbut
youre not running out of it

DAPHNE
Then keep eating it

As Daphne and Jerry approach the end of the balcony Seth
looks up from a conversation with some HIGH-SOCIETY TYPES

SETH
This is guy you should be talking
to Hes the social climber
JERRY
Dont listen to him Im already on
top
Everyone LAUGHS leading inexplicably into

Venezuela from Venezuela is desperately trying to escape
Jerrys clutches as hes turned her lifesaving resuscitation
of him into a BLUE VOMIT-SOAKED MAKEOUT SESSION

Abruptly getting his bearings Jerry releases Venezuela from
Venezuela she scrambles away MUTTERING PRAYERS IN SPANISH

Gerald is awake and on his feet staring down at Jerry

GERALD
The reason I hire women who look
like that Gerald is specifically
to avoid lawsuits that might arise
from just that sort of behavior

Gerald heads off after Venezuela from Venezuela
Jerry remains flat on his back mortified
DISSOLVE TO
INT JERRYS FATHERS HOME - STORAGE ROOM -- DAY 133H

Jerry lies in bed watching his DVD of Under Siege Margot--
FURTHER ALONG IN HER PREGNANCY--is seated at his side

MARGOT
So the doctor said no permanent
damage Thats good huh

ON TV -- STEVEN SEAGAL stuffs a rag into a coffee cup douses
the rag with what appears to be some type of alcohol and
fills the cup with water He then places the mixture inside
a microwave oven and starts the timer

MARGOT (CONTD)
Pretty lucky for you that Venezuela
from Venezuela found the card since
she cant read English

Jerry tenses FAST-FORWARDING THROUGH THE DVD
MARGOT (CONTD)

Even luckier for you that I was the
first one she showed it to

Margot flips THE SUICIDE CARD onto the bed

JERRY
Thats just a work thing

MARGOT
For the job you dont have anymore

JERRY
Im looking to get back in the game

MARGOT
Its got your name on it

JERRY
So did every other card I wrote

MARGOT
Not on the inside

An extended silence Jerry PAUSES THE DVD

JERRY
For the sake of argument lets say
that what happened the other night
was an attempt to end my own life
I failed Margot Just like I have
at every other fucking thing for
what seems like the last thousand
years Business as usual

MARGOT

Maybe the greeting card thing isnt
for you Jerry Or maybe it will
be but it just isnt right now In
either case--so what Youre smart
youre talented and all the setbacks
in the world are no reason to give
up on life

(beat )
Whatever happened with that girl you
were seeing The waitress I thought
that was going somewhere

Discomfited Jerry RESUMES THE DVD Margot takes the hint

MARGOT (CONTD)
I know Dads expecting you to prove
something to him but fuck that
The only person you have to prove
anything to is yourself Its time
you figured out what I--and a lot of
other people--already know Jerry

134A

ON TV -- TOMMY LEE JONES and GARY BUSEY are arguing in the
galley when the MICROWAVE BEEPS Everyone SCREAMS and dives
for cover as STEVEN SEAGALS HOMEMADE MICROWAVE-BOMB EXPLODES

MARGOT (CONTD)
Youre a productive person whos got
something to give to the world

INT COMMERCIAL AIRLINER - COACH CABIN -- DAY

Jerry has a seatback in his lap a LAUGHING WOMAN elbowing
him on one side a SLEEPING MAN drooling on him on the other
side and THREE KARATE KIDS pummeling his head from behind

But his expression remains blank Jerry is the living dead
EXT PHILIPS HOUSE - BACKYARD -- DAY

The spacious and extravagant home is an ostentatious testament
to Philips success Seated at the edge of the diving board
over the very large pool is Jerry nursing a can of soda

He begins to let himself very slowly--almost imperceptibly--
tilt forward Closer and closer towards the water

PHILIP (0S)
Dont do it

Jerry snaps up to see Philip--drunk and smiling--approaching
with two pifla coladas in hand

PHILIP (CONTD)
You cant kill yourself without having
a real drink first

Philip flops down next to Jerry and passes him a cocktail

PHILIP (CONTD)
I know the missus said you werent
allowed but she aint the missus
until tomorrow The liquor cabinets
still all mine

Producing a small key Philip lays it next to Jerry
PHILIP (CONTD)
All I ask is that it not be bare

when we get back from the honeymoon

Jerry frowns annoyed by the dig Philip doesnt notice

134A
PHILIP (CONTD)

(reflective)
Cant believe Im getting married
tomorrow Could you ever have
imagined freshman year that you
and I would be sitting here one day
I have a lot of great things in my
life Jerry A lot of great things

Jerry is chewing through his straw to bite his tongue

PHILIP (CONTD)
But do I deserve what I have More
importantly do I want it

JERRY
Ill take it off your hands
(then quickly)
Most of it

PHILIP
You ever wonder if the life youre
living isnt the one youre supposed
to be living

JERRY
Lets seeI used to live in an
awesome apartment now I live at my
fathers house I used to make a
living calling my own shots now I
sell coin-storage units over the
phone I used to have money now I
couldnt afford to stay at a hotel
for your wedding I used to have
friends now they all think Ima
fucking joke

PHILIP
Nobody thinks youre a joke Jerry--

JERRY
I dont wonder if Im living the
wrong life Philip I know I am
Its proven by every second of my
miserable existence

PHILIP
Everyones got problems

JERRY
(scoffs)
Im the only one sitting here who
has any

PHILIP
(angered)
You know what Jerry You couldnt
even imagine the problems in my life

Jerry stares at Philip in disbelief

JERRY
Youre joking right
(beat slow burn)
I dont have to imagine your life
Philip--because it used to me mine
And there were no problems It was
a fucking cakewalk In fact

Jerry stands up his anger getting the better of him

JERRY (CONTD)
You dont deserve what you have
Your whole life is the result of
blind fucking luck

Philip rises his emotional level matching Jerrys

PHILIP
And your life is what--the fruits
of hard labor

Jerry looks like he could punch Philip in the facebut he
holds back taking on a false air of calmness

JERRY
And there it is Im one of those
people now The people who--unlike
you and Seth and Mug--actually
know what it feels like to not get
every single thing you want

Jerry makes his way towards the door

PHILIP
You think weve gotten everything we
wanted Jerry You think I have

JERRY
(stops wheels around)
What havent you got Philip What
the fuck havent you got

Philip suddenly falls silent looking over Jerrys shoulder

Jerry turns to see Unpleasant Fiancé--a gargoyle of skin
hair and nail treatments-in-progress--in the doorway

UNPLEASANT FIANCE
What the fuck is going on out here

PHILIP
(cowed)
Im sorry sweetie

JERRY
Im sorry too sweetie Rest assured
I will behave cordially tomorrow so
as not to ruin your magical day
(to Philip)
Then Ill disappear into history as
one of the unlucky ones

PHILIP
Jerry wait

Jerry heads inside flashing the liquor cabinet key to
Unpleasant Fiancé as he slides past her

JERRY
Got your booze Yoko

Im trying to be honest with you

But Jerry is gone

Off to the side are Philips tuxedoed GROOMSMEN--Seth Mug
and Jerry among them--all clapping and smiling Some of
them fake-smiling

INT RECEPTION HALL - DINING AREA -- NIGHT 136

Grand and ostentatious is the theme evident from the scope
of the hall to the last detail of the flatware Formalities
have been attended to and the party is in full swing--ie
everyones drunk

Seated away from the center of the action Jerry and Seth
are kicking back with a couple of beers taking it all in

SETH
How long are you staying out here

JERRY
Im leaving tomorrow

They both sip their beers Moments pass

SETH
Im out of town the next two days
Would it be at all possible for you
to extend your trip until Tuesday
I want to take you to lunch talk to
you about something

JERRY
What did I do

SETH
Its nothing bad Im just too drunk
to get into it right now not to
mention the fact that Ive got a
seven am flight tomorrow
(checks watch dismayed)

Holy shit
JERRY
(looking 0S stunned)
Holy shit

Jerry has spotted a WAITRESS across the room
A waitress who is DAPHNE

SETH
So you think you could you stay in
town for a couple extra days

JERRY
(inspired re Daphne)
Uhyeah Definitely

INT RECEPTION HALL - FOYER -- LATER

Outside the dining area the wide central hall leading to
the main entrance is intersected by two smaller passageways
one hosting the public restrooms the other leading to the
kitchen and trafficked exclusively by STAFF MEMBERS

Jerry is lingering outside the former a glass of champagne
in his hand Soon enough Daphne emerges from the latter

JERRY
Miss I have a complaint I think
someones been watering down this
champagne

Needing only a beat to mask her obvious surprise Daphne
matter-of-factly approaches Jerry She takes the flute from
him downs its contents and hands back the empty glass

DAPHNE
What champagne

JERRY
I have a second complaint

DAPHNE
(re tuxedo)
You were in this wedding

JERRY
Yeah you met my friend Philip I
was one of his groomsmen

DAPHNE
(beat confused)
I thought he was
(then )
Is that guy Mug here

JERRY
(oblivious)
I saw you a little while ago and I
couldnt believe it I cant believe
it What are the odds wed run into
each other like this

DAPHNE
Dont take this the wrong way Jerry
but I didnt have the odds of you
being alive as very good
(then )
I got your message you left on
Christmas Eve

A beat Jerry isnt quick enough to cover his blank stare

DAPHNE (CONTD)
You dont remember leaving me a
message on Christmas Eve

JERRY
Daphne I did a lot of things wrong
(MORE)

JERRY (CONTD)
I was all fucked up I didnt treat
you nearly as well as I should have
Not even close But not a day has
gone by when I havent thought about
you And now running into you like
thisat the risk of sounding
cheesyI think its fate

Jerry and Daphne lock eyes hopeful

DAPHNE
No

Daphne looks as surprised as Jerry does at her own response

JERRY
Okay fate might be too strong a
term What Im saying is this is
our second chance

DAPHNE
It might be your second chance But
it would be my likethirtieth

JERRY
I said I was sorry

DAPHNE
No you didnt

JERRY
(beat )
Okay well Im saying it now

DAPHNE
Thanks But you and I are long past
apologies Jerry That ship sailed
after the first hundred times I tried
to reach you and heard nothing back

JERRY
So if were past apologies

DAPHNE
Where the hell were you

JERRY
Where are we

A heavy silence

Then Daphne abruptly steps forward wrapping Jerry in a loving
embrace A goodbye-forever embrace

DAPHNE
Promise me Jerry

JERRY
Promise you what

DAPHNE
Promise what you dont know

JERRY
Okay I promise
DAPHNE
You just promised to take care of

yourself
(beat choking up)
And to never call me again

Daphne moves off faster than ripping off a Band-Aid making
sure not to look back as she disappears around a corner

And Jerry simply stands alonelooking like he could put a
bullet in his head that very second

Its pouring rain on the hip little joint and the rest of

INT UPSCALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS 140

Jerry--staring at the rain--is at a window table with Seth

SETH
Im really excited about FlipWordz
You know the kind of stuff we thought
we were going to be doing when we
started working for bleep
(no response)
Jerry

JERRY
(blinks out of reverie)
Things that require thought and arent
completely patronizing and clichéd

SETH
Thats what its going to be
JERRY
How did Fat Asshole ever allow you
to break away with such a plan
Its contrary to everything he knows

SETH
I made him a lot of money at
Plattitudes And due to the fact
that he staked me in FlipWordz hes
going to get a big piece of the pie

JERRY
Hes still going to be making money
from your company

SETH
Only up to a predetermined ceiling
of net profit Were projecting
that itll be mine free and clear
after the first year The important
thing is that Im going to have
complete artistic control from the
get-go Speaking of which

Seth finishes a bite of his lunch and wipes his hands

SETH (CONTD)
I was wondering if youd want to
come work for me

JERRY -- Is stunned

JERRY
Likeas a janitor

SETH
More like running a creative division

JERRY
Are you shitting me

SETH
Youre the most talented out of all
of us Jerry You always have been

JERRY
I live with my dad and I sell coin
storage units for a living

SETH
Youre also the laziest out of all
of us and always have been

JERRY
Your compliments are confusing

SETH
I didnt come here to compliment
you Jerry I came here to offer
you a job And if you accept it--
even though youll be coming in at a
high level--I1l be watching you
more closely than Ill watch mailroom
employees

JERRY
Thats harsh

SETH
Ive got a lot on the line here
If youre afraid of getting your
feelings hurt walk away But Id
like to think that youre willing to
stop coasting get back on the rails
and seriously apply your talent--
maybe for the first time ever

Jerry sits back thoughtful

JERRY
You already have mailroom employees

SETH
Not yet actually

JERRY
(beat smiles)
Good I want to be the first one to
fire one of those lazy bastards

Jerry leans forward and clasps hands with Seth who grins

SETH
Cancel that return flight Weve
got a lot of work to do And go buy
yourself some new clothes while
youre at it--on the company tab of
course Try to took professional

They both LAUGH Jerrys happier than weve ever seen him

Jerry pockets his phone pleased as punch Unlike the CROSS-

like a person for whom all is right with the world

A passing car zooms through a puddle soaking everyone except
for Jerrywho miraculously remains bone dry

As the other people stagger back from the curb stunned and
furious Jerry turns to face them with a shrug and a smile

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 145

Jerry is in bed propped up and monstrously fucked-up His
swollen face is black and purple and covered with abrasions
his jaw is wired shut a feeding tube is secured to his mouth
Everything down one side of his body--arm hip and leg--is
immobilized in large braces with pins sticking out

JERRY (VO)
Stupid and irritating people would
say that Im lucky to be alive But
that sentiment only applies to
individuals who hadnt received a
new lease on life less than an hour
before they were almost killed

Jerrys good hand gives a couple of clicks on the morphine
button to which hes hooked up

Mug is standing near the far wall having affixed a mini-
basketball hoop like the one from Jerrys old office He
takes a practice shot and the hoop falls

MUG

Im sorry Jerry--I cant fucking
deal with this anymore Im sorry

Mug storms out of the room Jerry looks confused
INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY 146

Jerrys still bedridden though his facial wounds have
improved somewhat and the pins have been removed from his

various body braces His jaw is still wired shut An
unfamiliar UPTIGHT MALE LAWYER is seated at his side

STRANGE LAWYER
As you know the man who struck you--
who was killed in the accident--was
uninsured We have since discovered
that he had no viable assets income
or even any next of kin that could
be required to compensate you for
the damages incurred Theoretically
you could file a claim against the
city but Bambi feels that it would
be imprudent of her to move forward
on any new cases for you until you
have settled up your outstanding
debts with our office I dont
suppose you could write a check now

Jerry stares stonefaced at the lawyer clicking his morphine
button a few times

STRANGE LAWYER (CONTD)
In any case Bambi is terribly upset
that she hasnt been able to visit
you yet I was authorized to purchase
this for you at the gift shop

The lawyer reaches into a bag at his feet producing a small
stuffed bear with the phrase HUGS stitched onto its belly

STRANGE LAWYER (CONTD)
Which Bambi would like to represent
a proxy hug on her behalf

Jerry snatches the bear clutching it to his chest
JERRY (VO)
If nothing else I can take solace
in the fact that this is a bad as
things are going to get for me

even more cleared up--is asleep He blinks awake

LAUGHING at Jerrys horrified reaction Fat Asshole backs
up taking a seat

FAT ASSHOLE (CONTD)
Sorry I came so early but its the
only time I could fit you in So I
heard you just got the jaw unlocked
Youve been eating liquid food this
whole fucking time dude Thats
woebegone

Jerry musters a condescending grin

FAT ASSHOLE (CONTD)
(abruptly angered)
Fuck you man I was just trying to
keep the mood light here ‘cause of
why I came

Jerry looks concerned A pause

FAT ASSHOLE (CONTD)
The thing with Seth isnt happening

JERRY -- Couldnt find the words even if he could speak

FAT ASSHOLE (CONTD)
Due to your medical condition its
not financially advisable for Seth
to have you on staff Its a startup
so he needs everybody operating at a
hundred percent I know it seems
harsh J-Dog but what are you gonna
do Its a real woebegone situation

Jerrys eye is twitching Rigid he begins clicking his
morphine button with a vengeance

DISSOLVE TO

Once youve given up on life the
worst thing you can do is reconsider
Because if the first fall is a long
onethe second one is forever

Just to the side of Jerrys bed is a LARGE WINDOW looks out
into the HALLWAY Quite inexplicably the window appears to
BRIEFLY FLASH WITH STATIC as though it were a TV SCREEN

Even more inexplicably the next STATIC FLASH gives way to a
SPLIT-SECOND GLIMPSE of STEVEN SEAGAL PERFORMING A ROUNDHOUSE
KICK

Jerry turns to look at the window--or as it happens

HIS MORPHINE-ADDLED SUBCONSCIOUS THOUGHTS INTERACTIVE DISPLAY

Jerry struggles to leave his bed without success

Daphne presses herself up against the glass lustful

DAPHNE

Jerry begins violently yanking his whole bed towards the
window straining to hop it towards the imaginary Daphne
Just as hes about to reach her

FLASH -- Its just Steven Seagal

STEVEN SEAGAL
You know what you have to do

Startled Jerry flails off of the bed and onto the floor

END MORPHINE-ADDLED SUBCONSCIOUS THOUGHTS INTERACTIVE DISPLAY

His face squished against the linoleum Jerry mutters
incoherently as he drifts into unconsciousness

DISSOLVE TO
INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- AFTERNOON 149

Jerry is free of his casts and braces seated in a wheelchair
by the window In his arms he holds his BABY NEPHEW

Margot is seated in a chair next to Jerry

MARGOT
Has the physical therapy helped

Jerry shrugs

MARGOT (CONTD)
Youve got to at least be excited
about getting out of here

JERRY
Ive got nowhere to go

MARGOT
I thought you were staying with your
friend Philip and his wife

JERRY
Not for long

MARGOT
Whats the plan after that

JERRY
Im so grateful that you guys came
out to see me I know it wasnt
easy traveling with the baby and
everything--and you Will getting
the time off work

WILL -- Futzing with the TV gives a dont mention it wave

JERRY (CONTD)
It meant a lot to me to see somebody
from my family

Margot takes the baby from Jerry and hands him to Will

WILL
(to Jerry)
Hang in there pal Well see you
soon

Will exits with the baby

MARGOT
Ive had a couple things with me
this whole time but I promised Id
wait until I was leaving before I
gave them to you

Margot reaches into a bag at her feet producing a large
oblong gift-wrapped box She holds it out for Jerry

MARGOT (CONTD)
From Dad Its probably going to
make you mad but you have to
understand that he really thinks
its a nice gesture

Reluctantly Jerry takes the gift He tears away the paper
and opens the box revealing

GERALDS ORNATELY DESIGNED CANE -- The very same one from
Jerrys childhood

MARGOT (CONTD)
You are going to need something for
walking aroundand I mean thats
better than a crutch right

JERRY
Is the other thing worse or better

Margot gets to her feet and gathers her belongings a simple
greeting card envelope cinched in her fingers She bends
down to give Jerry a hug and a kiss on the cheek

MARGOT
Love you Jerry

She straightens up having left the envelope in Jerrys lap

MARGOT (CONTD)
Everybody does In their own way

With that Margot leaves

Alone Jerry stares at the envelope

DISSOLVE TO

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

Jerry is sitting up in bed staring worriedly at the still-
unopened envelope on which HIS NAME IS WRITTEN IN A FEMININE
HAND Slowly and indecisively Jerry peels it open

He removes the greeting card and begins to read it

JERRYS MOTHER (VO)
Jerry It rips my heart out that I
havent been able to be by your side
since the accident As soon as I
found out about it I started making
plans to come see you But when I
called the hospital about sending
something ahead for you I found out
some very scary news that only made
what happened that much worse

JERRY (VO)
It hadnt even occurred to me that
Id lost my health insurance when I
got fired from Plattitudes

As he continues to read Jerry looks increasingly nauseated

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
My mother had taken out a loan and
gotten a second job to pay her thirty-
year-old sons hospital bills Not
only did that keep her from having
the time to come out and see me she
couldnt afford it She never even
told my dadwho could have paid
easily

Jerry begins to CRY reading the last of the note

JERRYS MOTHER (VO)
I hope you can forgive me Jerry
for not being there for you in person
This was not an easy decision to
make and I wish more than anything
that I could have done both I love
you with all my heart and I hope to
see you soon Love Mom

Jerry drops the card in his lap now SOBBING UNCONTROLLABLY
All the shitty things that have happened to him all the
things hes done wrong a lifetime of holding it inits
all pouring out now

He happens to glance at the back of the card which has
flipped over in his lap Its a PLATTITUDES cardand
the author signature belongs to

ACE

JERRY -- Stops crying on a dime his expression of sadness
and release replaced by one of insane rage

151A

AT THE HALLWAY WINDOW -- An inexplicable FLASH OF LIGHTNING
and there stands STEVEN SEAGAL staring at Jerry and nodding
You know what must be done

JERRY -- Nods back at Steven Seagal a maniacal glint in his
eye Fuck yeah I do

(MUSIC ICE CUBES CHROME AND PAINT)
Jerry dressed in the suit he was wearing when he got hit by
the car--its badly torn in several places and still showing
traces of blood stains--pimp-walks through the parking lot
with purpose relying on HIS FATHERS CANE
--On his shoulder he carries A MICROWAVE OVEN
INT PLATTITUDES - FAT ASSHOLES OFFICE -- A SHORT WHILE LATER

Jerry sweeps clear some space on the desk in the otherwise
unoccupied office and sets the microwave on it

He opens its door and removes a bottle of alcohol a jug of
water a rag and a coffee mug the ingredients for the Steven
Seagal Under Siege microwave bomb

Jerry assembles the concoction in the mug and places it
back in the oven He checks his watch trying to figure out
how much time to put on the clockwhen his eyes happen to
fall upon THE WORD-A-DAY DESK CALENDAR

JERRY
Please be something having to do
with vengeance or retribution

Jerry grabs the calendar seeing that--

THE WORD OF THE DAY IS GLABROUS (adj) -- Smooth having a
surface without hairs projections or any unevenness

JERRY (CONTD)
(beat shrugs)
Whatever

Jerry places the calendar on top of the microwave and sets
the oven timer for 15 minutes

MAN (0S)
What are you doing

151A

Jerry freezes not turning around

JERRY
Bleep

MAN (0S)
No Im Tim

ON JERRY -- As fireballs explode behind his eyes

JERRY
TIM ACE--

Jerry wheels around finding himself face-to-face with TIM
ACE JONES (40s)--a small-statured gentleman with a shy and
pleasant demeanora superstar quarterback he is not

JERRY (CONTD)
(rage derailed)
-Jones

MANTIM ACE JONES
Howd you know that

JERRY
(pause searching)
Im very familiar with the company
Im their microwave oven supplier

TIM ACE JONES
Does bleep owe you money or
something ‘Cause that Under Siege
microwave bomb isnt gonna work

Jerry attempts to stifle his surprise

TIM ACE JONES (CONTD)
You set the timer for fifteen minutes
which is when bleep would normally
get back from lunch But even if
you could predict the exact time
that a homemade bomb like that is
going to explode--which you cant--
the mixtures going to detonate way
before then

JERRY
(playing dumb)
A bomb ‘Under Siege

TIM ACE JONES
Steven Seagal did set the timer for
fifteen minutes but youve neglected
(MORE)
TIM ACE JONES (CONTD)
to account for the fact he turned
the power off when he left the galley
When Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey
came into the galley later they
turned the power back on and then
the bomb exploded

The two men stare at the running microwave ponderous

TIM ACE JONES (CONTD)
Its a pretty good movie

JERRY
If you view it ironically
(then )
Why arent you at lunch with everyone
else

TIM ACE JONES
I never go out to lunch Way too
busy

JERRY
(scoffs)
At this job

TIM ACE JONES
I know it sounds stupid but writing
greeting cards is the only thing
Ive ever wanted to do in my life
Problem was I never used to be much
good at it Not to say that Im
great at it nowbut Im getting
better every day Or at least Im
trying to every day

JERRY
You were good enough to get a job at
this place Take a fucking lunch
break once in a while

TIM ACE JONES
I dont want to get complacent
Ive worked too hard to let myself
take things for granted The way I
see it if you make your living doing
something that always comes easy to
youyoure not doing it right

ON JERRY -- As that hits him like a ton of bricks

152A

A HISSING SOUND emanates from the microwave Tim Ace Jones
grabs Jerry and pulls him to the floor as the microwave bomb
EXPLODES blasting debris everywhere

Jerry and Tim poke their heads up surveying the damage
Shreds of the word-a-day calendar float gently in the air

JERRY
Thanks Tim

TIM ACE JONES
Call me Ace

JERRY
No thanks Tim

Both of the guys get to their feet

TIM ACE JONES
Too bad bleep didnt get to see
this happen Guys a real asshole

Jerry smiles loving Tim Ace Jones

JERRY
I should split before he gets back

TIM ACE JONES
I dont think hes coming back today
There was some kind of accident with
one of the guys who works here I
didnt get the details before
everybody took off but apparently
its pretty bad

Mug Seth and Fat Asshole come running around from the front
finding the backyard to be a crime scene POLICE OFFICERS
and PARAMEDICS roam among NEIGHBORS that have wandered over

Mug Seth and Fat Asshole head straight for the pool area
which has been cordoned off with police tape All three of
them react in abject horror to the sight of

152A

PHILIPS BODY in nothing but swimming trunks floating face
down in the water An upturned drink glass floats near him

JERRY (VO)
Accidental drowning was the official
word

MUG -- Falls to his knees pulling at his hair His mouth
opens in an anguished scream that we cannot hear His eyes
wander across the pool seeking out--

UNPLEASANT WIFE Shes standing by the back door with some
FRIENDS and a couple of DETECTIVES her mascara having run

down her face in now-tried tears As she exhales a stream

of cigarette smoke her eyes meet Mugs

JERRY (VO) (CONTD)
But well always call it something
else

Mug leaps to his feet charging at Philips widow Seth and
Fat Asshole grab Mug before he can get to her POLICE OFFICERS
intervene Mug strains to break free a raging madman

UNPLEASANT WIDOW -- Stares blankly back at Mug unaffected
Takes another drag of her cigarette

MATCH CUT TO
INT CATHEDRAL -- DAY 154
Unpleasant Widow now dressed in mourning clothes is still
wearing the same expression staring OS at someone But

now the someone staring back at her is--

JERRY Hes standing at the lectern about to deliver a
eulogy to the PACKED HOUSE at Philips funeral

Jerry reaches into his jacket pocket starting to pull out
some folded papers--his prepared remarks But he appears to
have second thoughts taking his hand off them Hes going
to speak from his heart

But theneyeing the crowd Jerry thinks better of it He
produces his speech and begins to read from it

EXT PHILIPS HOUSE - BACKYARD -- MOMENTS LATER

Jerry comes limping with the cane out of the house a glass
of Scotch in his hand

JERRY
You cant kill yourself without having
a real drink first

Philip looks up giving Jerry a halfhearted smile Jerry
sits down next to Philip handing him the glass

PHILIP
Nice eulogy

JERRY

You know what I thought I really
thought I was going to have one of
those dramatic moments where the guy
has prepared remarks to give and
then at the last second he throws
them aside and gives a heroic speech
from the heart

PHILIP
If anybody knew how to really speak
from the heart guys like you and me
would be out of business

JERRY
You and me are out of business

PHILIP
Easy for you to say

A painful pause

JERRY
I shouldnt have walked away from
you Philip Maybe if I had stayed
maybe if Id listened to you

PHILIP
You couldve sat out here with me
until the cows came home and I might
never have said what Id wanted to
(MORE)

PHILIP (CONTD)
say And even if I hadit was
already too late

JERRY
If Id been a better friend to you
it never would have gotten that far

PHILIP
You were working with limited
information Jerry
(then )
Why am I trying to make you feel
better Whos the dead one here

JERRY

I was until a couple days ago At
least thats how I saw it--and how I
wanted everyone else to see it My
problems were the worst problems in
the world Philip There was no one
on earth who was suffering as I was
sufferingespecially not my friends

PHILIP
And we werent Problems are like
snowflakes Excepthorrible

JERRY
Things go so right for so long youre
not equipped to handle it when theres
a bump in the road So you ignore
it which drives you right into
another bump then another and
another and the next thing you know--

PHILIP
Youre a corpse floating facedown
in your own pool

JERRY
I was going to say youre driven
right off the road but the song
remains the same

PHILIP
Mine was more topical

JERRY
Abandoned the theme though--
(regroups )
Point iswe were close friends who
didnt really know each other
(MORE)

JERRY (CONTD)
And I think thats because our entire
friendship was based on the good
times Neither of us--none of us
including Mug and Seth--were ever
willing or able to deal with the bad
times So when things went bad
individually--and boy did they go
bad--all any of us could do was turn
inward

PHILIP
Didnt want to ruin the party

JERRY
We were so full of shit Philip We
made our living compressing the range
of human emotion into brightly-
colored easily digestible single
servings available for three-forty-
nine apiece And the better somebody
gets at that--and we were fucking
good--the less capable a person makes
himself of facing anything that
doesnt have a gift-wrapped
guaranteed satisfactory result
Whether its something that makes us
unhappy something were afraid of

Jerry follows Philips gaze into the house finding UNPLEASANT
WIDOW Stepping in to block her from view is MUG

PHILIP
Something we really want

JERRY -- Is floored by his realization
JERRY
Holy shit Thats what Daphne was
talking about

Smart girl that Daphne Probably
shouldnt have fucked that one up

Philip has put everything in
perspectiveas Mug can certainly
attest to

It was bleeps idea to rescind
your job offer when you were in the
hospital Jerry--not mine But whats
truly awful about that is the fact
that I let him talk me into it without
a fight Im ashamed of myself I
want to set things right focus on
whats important You me and Mug
on our own--like it always should
have been

MUG
