family sir

HARRY

more than a thief Mr Borgin

Though if his marks dont pick

I would have thought youd be
ashamed that a girl of no

LUCIUS MALFOY

(deadly)
Not with me

ground
RON

There See Now I reckon all we

have to do is find the Hogwarts

Express and follow it Simple
Harry nods not entirely convinced He peers out the
window Down below TWO PEDESTRIANS stare in disbelief

HARRY
Uh Ron I should tell you Most

Muggles arent accustomed to
seeing a flying car

RON
Right
Ron presses a TINY SILVER BUTTON on the dashboard and
they DISAPPEAR Down below the baffled pedestrians

feet above the tracks The boys peer ahead looking for
the train

RON

It must be around here

Behind them through the Anglias rear window the
Hogwarts Express APPEARS closing fast Harry and Ron
perk up Smile

HARRY

Do you hear that
Then at precisely the same moment Harry and Ron
register the DIRECTION of the sound They glance at each
other turn as one and see the train GROWING HUGE in the
rear window

HARRY RON
Aaaahhhhh
Ron SPINS THE WHEEL puts his foot to the gas and -- at
the last possible second -- whips the Anglia out of the

trains path The car WAFFLES TOPPLES upside down

LASHING FORWARD like a MASSIVE FIST THWUMP

What kind of tree is this

Before Harry can respond the tree begins to PUMMEL THE
CAR from all sides tossing Henry and Ron about like
popcorn WINDOWS SHATTER Heavy DENTS appear on the
roof above Ron and Harrys heads Then the car FALLS
again

SLAMMING HEAVILY TO THE GROUND Instantly the
trees lower branches shoot through the front and rear
windscreens and gaining purchase begin to SHAKE THE CAR

BACK AND FORTH

Aaaaahhhhh
The tree PITCHES the car into the air As the Anglia
SLAMS DOWN again bobbing on its SQUEALING SHOCKS the

through the shattered windscreen The willows branches
as one rear back ready for one last punishing blow
Harry CRIES OUT

Reverse Reverse
Ron SHIFTS the CAR SHOOTS BACKWARDS and the willow
PUMMELS THE TREAD-MARKED GROUND they just vacated
Safely clear the doors fly open the seats tip sideways
and Ron and Harry are ejected As they hit the ground
their trunks fly from the boot Hedwigs cage rockets out
the back window and Hedwig herself flaps into the night
Taillights blazing angrily the BATTERED car speeds off

It transfigures into a beautiful crystal water

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Yes Miss Granger

HERMIONE

Professor I was wondering if you
could tell us about the Chamber of
Secrets
over the class

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
My subject is Transfiguration
Miss Granger

HERMIONE

Yes Professor But there seems
to be very little written about
the Chamber of Secrets For those
of us with a personal interest in
the subject that is
disturbing

Malfoy regards Hermione with chilly amusement
McGonagall considers Hermiones question for a long

moment then

nods

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Very well You all know of
course that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago by the
four greatest witches and wizards
of the age

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL (CONTD)

Godric Gryffindor Helga
Hufflepuff Rowena Ravenclaw and
Salazar Slytherin Three of the
founders co-existed quite
harmoniously One did not

RON

Three glasses who

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective about the students
admitted to Hogwarts He believed
that magical learning should be
kept within all-magic families
In other words purebloods
Unable to sway the others he
decided to leave the school

(a beat)

According to legend Slytherin had
built a hidden chamber in this
castle known as the Chamber of
Secrets Shortly before
departing he sealed it until that
time when his own true heir
returned to the school The heir
alone would be able to open the
Chamber of Secrets and unleash the
horror within and by so doing
purge the school of all those who
in Slytherins view were unworthy
to study magic

HERMIONE

Muggle-borns

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Yes Naturally the school has been
searched many times for such a
chamber It has never been found

HERMIONE

Professor what exactly does
legend tell us lies within the
Chamber

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
The Chamber is said to be home to
something which the heir of Slytherin
alone can control It is said to be
home to a monster

HOT PURSUIT They RACE DOWNWARD trailing the HISSING

wooden support beams that crisscross their path
Directly behind them the Bludger FOLLOWS SHATTERING the

Malfoy KICKS Harry forcing him to the edge of the
trench Harry BRUSHES the wall battling for control

only inches from catching it when the Rogue Bludger
SMASHES INTO Harrys arm

Harry cries out steadies himself and with a brilliant
acrobatic move SNATCHES the Snitch out of the air with
his good hand Unable to control his broom with his
shattered arm he hits the pitch with a SICKENING THUD
Wincing Harry rolls onto his shoulders SQUINTS UP a
BLACK DOT -- growing rapidly LARGER -- is plummeting from
the sky directly toward him Its the rogue Bludger
Instantly Harry spins away grimacing in agony as the
Bludger

hits the ground like a SLEDGE HAMMER violently
TATTOOING the pitch again and again only inches from

Dobby had to iron his hands

possible he knew where the Chamber
was how to open it even what
sort of creature lives in it If
so whoevers behind the attacks

inside your -- do you call this a
house I simply called at the
school and was told the Headmaster
was here

DUMBLEDORE

And what exactly did you want with
me Lucius

LUCIUS MALFOY

Dreadful thing Dumbledore but
the governors feel its time for
you to step aside This is an
Order of Suspension Youll find
all twelve signatures on it Im
afraid we feel youre losing your
touch What with all these
attacks therell be no Muggle-
borns left at Hogwarts And we
all know what an awful loss that
would be

Fudge an OFFICIAL ROLL of PARCHMENT

FUDGE

Now see here Lucius Dumbledore

suspended No no last thing
we want right now If Dumbledore
cant stop these attacks I mean

to say who can
LUCIUS MALFOY

That remains to be seen but as
all twelve governors have voted --
HAGRID

An how many did yeh have ter
threaten before they agreed

LUCIUS MALFOY

I would advise you not to shout at
the Azkaban guards like that

HAGRID

Yeh can take Dumbledore Take him
away an the Muggle-borns won
stand a chance Therell be
killins next

114 114

DUMBLEDORE

Calm yourself Hagrid
(steely-eyed)
If the governors want my removal
Lucius I shall of course step
aside However you will find
that I will only truly have left
this school when none here are
loyal to me You will also find
that help will always be given at

Hogwarts to those who ask for
it
Dumbledores eyes drift -- unmistakably -- to Harry

LUCIUS MALFOY

Admirable sentiments We shall
all miss your highly individual
way of running things Albus and
only hope your successor will
manage to prevent any more um
killins
Malfoy strides to the door and bows Dumbledore out
Fudge fiddling with his bowler waits for Hagrid
Instead Hagrid stands his ground takes a deep breath
and says carefully

HAGRID

If anyone wanted ter find out some
stuff all theyd have ter do is
follow the spiders Thatd lead
em right Thas all Im sayin
Fudge stares at Hagrid in amazement then follows him
out As the door SLAMS SHUT FANG starts to HOWL

scratching at the closed door Harry and Ron emerge from

the cloak
RON

EXT SPIDERS HOLLOW - NIGHT 121A

Harry and Ron enter a hollow ribboned with shadows
Enormous trees tower over them strewn with strands of
white webbing Ron steps on a strand kicks it off
queasily Harry peers up ahead at the far end of the
hollow the spiders stream toward a DARK OPENING

As Harry and Ron approach the opening a CLICKING SOUND
emanates from within ECHOING in the branches of the tall
trees GROWING LOUDER Ron falters glancing about
nervously

RON

I dont have a good feeling about
this Harry --

HARRY
Dont panic
As Harry steps to the mouth of the cavern the AIR

suddenly CRACKLES with MOVEMENT TWIGS SNAP A HUGE
SHADOW emerges slowly engulfs Harry He peers up

SEES

An ANCIENT SPIDER (ARAGOG) the size of a small elephant
As it advances Harry and Ron back slowly away Then

its BLIND EYES catch the light and it STOPS As if
listening

ARAGOG

You do not come from the forest
Your hearts beat like men

HARRY

(breathing finally)
Yes Were friends of Hagrids
And you youre
(as it comes to him)
Aragog arent you

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev 12802

Hearing this Aragogs head turns slightly
ARAGOG

Hagrid has never sent men into our
hollow before

HARRY

Hes in trouble Up at school
thereve been attacks They think
its Hagrid They think hes
opened the Chamber of Secrets
Like before
As Harry talks Rons eyes dart warily about then

RONS POV - a pair of long legs -- SPIDERS LEGS -- curl

slowly around the trunk of the tree to his left
Terrified Ron NUDGES Harry but Harry ignores him

ARAGOG

Thats a lie Hagrid never opend
the Chamber of Secrets

HARRY
But if Hagrid never that
means youre not the monster
ARAGOG

The monster was born in the

castle I came from a distant

land in the pocket of a traveler

Pause Waiting Watching

HARRY

Shhh

ancient creature we spiders fear
above all others

HARRY

A SCRABBLING SOUND ECHOES above Ron He GLANCES UP a

SPIDER crouches on a branch above
ARAGOG

I never saw any part of the castle

but the cupboard in which Hagrid

kept me The girl was discovered

in a bathroom When I was

accused Hagrid brought me here
More SCRABBLING Ron looks up We PAN UP with him
SEE SPIDERS -- in high and low branches -- DROPPING
DOWNWARD like paratroopers Ron GRABS Harry

HARRY

Ron points Harry looks Pales Turns slowly back to
Aragog

HARRY
121A

Well thank you Well just
go

ARAGOG

Go I think not My sons and
daughters do not harm Hagrid on
my command But I cannot deny

them fresh meat when it wanders so
willingly into our midst

Goodbye friend of Hagrid

Desperately Harry swings the LANTERN in his hand The
spiders falter then CREEP FORWARD again as the ARC of
the LIGHT chases itself away Around and around Then
The LANTERN goes out

Harry pitches it aside As one he and Ron draw their

wands

closer CLICKING FEVERISHLY when

a LONG LOUD HORN BLEATS Seconds later a BLAZE of
LIGHT ignites the hollow and the FORD ANGLIA comes
THUNDERING over the rim and down the slope KNOCKING

wheel and sends the car sliding away The spiders
STAMPEDE after

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - BLACK PARK - NIGHT

The Anglia SLALOMS through the forest skimming past
trees as the spiders CHARGE after Harry peers ahead
SEES an area of FALLEN TREES There is an OPENING one
narrow escape route

HARRY

That way Its the only way out

Hurry Theyre catching up
Ron JAMS the accelerator just as a GIANT TARANTULA
drops in front of the escape route Harry and Ron are as
good as dead

HARRY
Can you get us in the air
RON

gear stick)
Flying gears jammed

The spiders behind DRAW CLOSER The TARANTULA waits
ahead Harry claps his hand over Rons on the gear

kill when the GEAR SHIFT GIVES the Anglias wheels
LIFT and the CAR FLIES OVER CAMERA leaving the furious
spiders below The car barely avoids the rearing
tarantula then sails over the trees

A glint of sympathy flickers in Pomfreys eyes

As she exits the boys step to her bed Absently Ron

Harry and Ron duck into an alcove take out the CRINKLED

HARRY

Of the many fearsome beasts that
roam our land none is more deadly
than the Basilisk Capable of
living for hundreds of years
instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpents eye Spiders
flee before it and only the
crowing of the rooster can kill
it

(looking up)
Ron This is it The monster in
the Chamber of Secrets is a
Basilisk Thats why I can hear
it speak Its a snake

RON

But it kills by looking people in

the eye Why is it no ones dead
Harry frowns contemplating this then catches he and
Rons REFLECTION in the window opposite He mutters

SOFTLY

HARRY

Because no one did look it in the
eye Not directly at least

(in a rush)
Colin saw it through his camera
Justin -- Justin mustve seen the
Basilisk through Nearly Headless

it but hes a ghost -- he

MOANING MYRTLE
I dont know I was distraught
But they said something funny A

kind of made-up language And I
realized it was a boy speaking

toppling into one of the open

their wands

So I unlocked the door to tell
him to go away and I died

feeding Ginny a few secrets to
start pouring a bit of my soul
back into her

No she couldnt -- she
wouldnt

on the Mudbloods and the Squibs

cat Ginny who wrote threatening

messages on the walls

But Why
TOM RIDDLE

Because I told her to Youll
find that I can be very
persuasive Not that she knew
what she was doing She was

shall we say in a kind of trance
Still the power of the diary
began to scare her and she tried
to dispose of it in the girls
bathroom But then who should
find it but you The very
person I was most anxious to meet

your trust

framed him didnt you

TOM RIDDLE
It was my word against Hagrids
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
Hagrid was innocent

HARRY

Ill bet Dumbledore saw right
through you

TOM RIDDLE

I knew it wouldnt be safe to open
the Chamber again while I was
still at school So I decided to
leave behind a diary preserving
my sixteen-year-old self in its
pages so that one day I would
be able to lead another to finish
Salazar Slytherins noble work

HARRY

Well you havent finished it this
time In a few hours Mandrake
Draught will be ready and everyone
who was petrified will be all
right again

TOM RIDDLE
Havent I told you that killing

Mudbloods doesnt matter to me
anymore For many months now my
new target has been you

learned Ginny had stolen the diary

back from you

She was afraid Afraid youd

learn how to work the diary

Afraid Id tell you just who it

was that had been strangling all

those roosters
Horrified Harry glances at Ginny growing more PALE
then back to Riddle who is growing more SOLID

TOM RIDDLE

Come now Harry Dont look so
disappointed Had Ginny succeeded
in destroying the diary she would
have destroyed me And we

couldnt be having this little
talk And I have so many
questions for you

HARRY
Like what

TOM RIDDLE

Well how is it that a baby with
no extraordinary magical talent
managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time How did you
escape with nothing but a scar
while Lord Voldemorts powers were
destroyed
HARRY

Why do you care how I escaped
Voldemort was after your time

TOM RIDDLE

future
Riddle pulls Harrys wand from his pocket and begins to
trace it through the air writing three words TOM

is the SORTING HAT at his feet Riddle picks it up

TOM RIDDLE

(giggling)
This is what Dumbledore sends his
defender A songbird and an old
hat
Riddle tosses aside the hat He turns to the statue of
Salazar Slytherin and speaks in Parseltongue

TOM RIDDLE

(Parseltongue)

Speak to me Slytherin
Suddenly the stone faces MOUTH OPENS There is a
RUMBLING SOUND followed by the sound of SLITHERING
Harry turns away The Basilisk A GIANT SERPENT spills
out uncoiling heavily to the floor Harry turns to the
wall The shadow of the serpent is visible on the wall
PAN TO Tom Riddle looking at Harry

TOM RIDDLE
Lets match the powers of Lord
Voldemort Heir of Salazar
Slytherin against the famous
Harry Potter shall we
Riddle turns to serpent speaking in Parseltongue

TOM RIDDLE

(Parseltongue)
Kill him
The HISSING SERPENT shoots forward Harry turns RUNS away

TOM RIDDLE

Parseltongue wont save you now
Potter The Basilisk only obeys me

HARRY

(to himself)
Dont look Dont look into its
eyes
Harry RACES along the stone path but the giant serpent
is FASTER Harry TRIPS FALLS The Basilisk RISES
Harry looks to the wall sees the serpent about to strike
Suddenly FAWKES SCREECHES soaring toward the Basilisk
and circling its blunt head confusing it The SNAKE

SNAPS furiously when Fawkes drops like a knife
driving its talons deep into the serpents glittering
eyes

As Harry watches the angry play of shadows on the wall
the BASILISK ROARS HISSING in pain Fawkes wings away
its talons dripping with blood and Harry turns LOOKS
the Basilisks eyes are a blind bloody mess

TOM RIDDLE

Fool Think youre safe It can

still hear you
As Harry flees the serpent thunders after STRIKING
BLINDLY as its whipping tail SHATTERS a Slytherin STATUE
Harry dodges and ducks then seeing the snake about to

strike again LEAPS CLEAR stumbling toward a SIDE
TUNNEL
133A INT CHAMBER OF SECRETS - SIDE TUNNEL - NIGHT 133A

Harry RACES HEADLONG into the shadows then looks back
sees the snake eclipse the light at the far end of the
tunnel and SLITHER QUICKLY inside

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev 21902 126A

133A 133A

Thinking Harry DUCKS INTO AN ALCOVE puts his hand over
his mouth and waits desperate to remain STILL and
SILENT The snake slides heavily by then SLOWS

TURNS BACK

The snakes head weaves inside only INCHES from Harrys
face Harry trembles as the snakes head cocks to the
side then finally WITHDRAWS

133B INT CHAMBER OF SECRETS - NIGHT 133B

Harry DASHES back into the main chamber Ginny looks
frighteningly pale Riddle GRINS cruelly almost SOLID

now

TOM RIDDLE
Yes Potter The process is
nearly complete In a few
minutes Ginny Weasley will be
dead And I will cease to be a
memory Lord Voldemort will
return Very much alive
Harry moves toward Ginny then suddenly the BASILISK

SHOOTS OUT of the TUNNEL HISSING directly in front of
133B

Harry Trapped Harry glances around then --
impulsively -- LEAPS upward begins to scale the statue
of Salazar Slytherin The serpent strikes madly but
Harry continues on CLIMBING BOLDLY until he reaches the
top He turns Sees the Sorting Hat Sees what

glitters within the RUBY HANDLE of a SWORD

Harry WHEELS sword in hand and fends off the slashing
serpent like St George and the dragon In a mad rush of
courage he PITCHES HIMSELF onto the serpent SLIDES DOWN
its back and rolls up SWORD RAISED Too tired to flee
Harry simply waits The serpent rises and FANGS

BARED STRIKES

Marshalling every ounce of strength left to him Harry
drives the sword upward deep into the roof of the
SERPENTS mouth It HISSES in PAIN thrashing MADLY as
it drives a FANG into Harrys arm Harry clutches his
arm in agony stumbles back and falls to the floor
watching as the serpent THRASHES briefly then goes

STILL

Harry peers down sees the FANG that pierces his arm the
blood soaking slowly into his robe As he yanks the fang
free Riddle steps forward almost fully whole now His
eyes shine at the sight of Harrys wound

TOM RIDDLE

Remarkable isnt it How quickly

the venom of the Basilisk

penetrates the body If you have

any final words Potter youd

best speak them now Id guess

you have little more than a minute

to live
Harry blinks heavily watching as the skin of his forearm
turns a troubling gray

challenged Youll be back with

As Riddle talks Harry glances at Ginny nearly white
now a small ghost the only evidence of life the
TREMBLING OF A SINGLE FINGER Harry studies the finger
and what lies beneath it Tom Riddles diary Harry
begins to crawl toward her

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev 41602 128 TOM RIDDLE
Funny isnt it The damage a

silly little book can do
Especially in the hands of a silly
little girl

As Harry reaches Ginny he places his hand on hers

then slips the diary free
TOM RIDDLE
What are you doing No Stop
Riddles face creases in fear He LUNGES FORWARD But
Harry is too quick Raising his hand high he PLUNGES

THE FANG into the book Instantly BLACK INK SPURTS from
the pages

TOM RIDDLE

No
Riddle SHRIEKS writhing in pain His body begins to
wither instantly growing BLURRY once more As the ink
runs off Harrys fingers to the floor Riddle VANISHES
altogether Harry sinks back then hears a FAINT
MOAN Ginny STIRS color blooming in her cheeks As she
sees Harry she SOBS

GINNY

Harry It was me But I swear I

didnt mean to Riddle made me
He wrote to me took me over
I didnt even know whose diary it

HARRY

Ginny You need to get yourself

out Follow the chamber

Youll find Ron
There is a RUSH OF WINGS and Fawkes circles down lays
his head onto Harrys arm

HARRY

You were brilliant Fawkes I

just wasnt quick enough
Then Harry blinks looks down Thick pearly TEARS are
trickling down Fawkes face and onto his arm Almost

instantly his wound begins to heal itself 133B
HARRY
Of course Dumbledore told me
Phoenix tears have healing powers
(looking up at Ginny)

Its all right Ginny Its over

Its just a memory

Ginny make their way back Up ahead SHIFTING ROCK can
be heard and a jagged fissure of LIGHT GLIMMERS Rons
face appears

Ron wriggles through rushes forward and hugs Ginny

RON

Youre alive I cant believe it

INT DUMBLEDORES OFFICE - DAY 135
Harry and Ron covered in muck and slime -- stand in

Dumbledores office Fawkes perches on a pedestal behind
Dumbledore who sits at his desk examining the charred
diary He looks up regarding Harry and Ron gravely

DUMBLEDORE
Ingenious Simply ingenious
(looking up)

Of course Tom Riddle was probably
the most brilliant student
Hogwarts has ever seen I taught
him myself fifty years ago After
he left I would occasionally hear
stories of his activities -- dark
rumors -- but after awhile even
the rumors stopped When he
finally resurfaced as Lord
Voldemort most people had
completely forgotten the clever
Head Boy hed once been

GINNY

I didnt know whose diary it was
sir I swear I found it inside
my cauldron

Harry frowns in thought recollecting

GINNY
But I understand if given all
the trouble Ive caused if
you --

DUMBLEDORE

Wiser wizards than you have been
hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort Miss
Weasley No I think youve
endured enough I would suggest a
bit of bed rest however And
perhaps a large mug of hot
chocolate I always find that
cheers me up Minerva will you
show Arthur and Molly up to the
hospital wing

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Certainly Albus
Harry and Ron watch them go Mrs
CE carries

MRS WEASLEY

A diary that writes back to you

Honestly Ginny What were you

thinking Havent I always told

you Never trust anything that

can think for itself if you cant

see where it keeps its brain

turn back See Dumbledore regarding them

DUMBLEDORE

You two realize of course that
in the last few hours you have
broken perhaps a dozen school
rules

HARRY RON
Yes sir
DUMBLEDORE

And that there is sufficient
evidence to expel you both

HARRY RON
Yes sir

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev 41702 131A

135 (1A) 135

DUMBLEDORE

Therefore it seems only
fitting

(eyes twinkling)
That you both receive Special
Awards for Services to the School
And -- let me see -- yes I think
two hundred points apiece which
I believe should be more than
enough to secure Gryffindor the
House Cup

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev 41602 132

135 135

HARRY RON
(grinning)
Thank you sir

DUMBLEDORE

Now Mr Weasley if you would
have an owl deliver these release
papers to Azkaban We need our
gamekeeper back

Ron nods takes the envelope and exits

DUMBLEDORE

First Harry I want to thank you
You must have shown me real
loyalty down in the Chamber
Nothing but that could have called
Fawkes to you Secondly I sense
youre troubled by something Am

I right

HARRY

Its just you see sir I
couldnt help noticing certain
things Certain similarities
Between Tom Riddle and me

THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS - Rev 3102 133

135 135

DUMBLEDORE

You can speak Parseltongue Harry
because Lord Voldemort can speak
Parseltongue Unless Im much
mistaken he transformed some of
his own powers to you the night he
gave you that scar

HARRY

Voldemort put a bit of himself in
me
DUMBLEDORE

Not intentionally but yes
HARRY
So the Sorting Hat was right I

should be a Slytherin
DUMBLEDORE

Its true Harry You do possess
many of the qualities Voldemort
himself prizes Resourcefulness
Determination A certain
disregard for the rules Yet the
Sorting Hat placed you in
Gryffindor

HARRY
Only because I asked it to
DUMBLEDORE

Exactly Which makes you very

different from Voldemort Its

not our abilities that show what

we truly are Harry Its our

choices

(smiling at him)

If you want proof that you belong

in Gryffindor Harry I suggest

you look more closely at this
Dumbledore hands the bloodstained sword to Harry An
ENGRAVED NAME glimmers above the ruby-encrusted hilt

HARRY

DUMBLEDORE

Only a true Gryffindor could have

pulled that out of the Hat

HARRY

Dobby This is your Master The
family you serve is the Malfoys
Dobby nods chagrined Lucius Malfoy brushes past Harry

LUCIUS MALFOY

Out of my way Potter
(to Dumbledore)
So Youve returned

DUMBLEDORE

Yes When the governors heard
that Arthur Weasleys daughter had
been taken into the Chamber they
saw fit to summon me back

(a wry smile)
Curiously several of them seemed
under the impression that you
would curse their families if they
didnt agree to suspend me in the
first place Lucius

LUCIUS MALFOY

From the beginning my only
concern has been the welfare of
this school and its students

I assume the culprit has been
identified

DUMBLEDORE

Oh yes It was Voldemort Only

this time he chose to act through

someone else By means of

this
As Dumbledore nudges the diary toward Lucius Malfoy
Harry sees Dobby nod meaningfully from the diary to
Lucius

DUMBLEDORE

Fortunately our young Mr Potter
discovered it

(a chill to his voice)
One only hopes that no more of
Lord Voldemorts old school things
find their way into innocent
hands The consequences for the
one responsible could be
severe

away

As Dobby scuttles toward the door Lucius Malfoy KICKS
HIM through it then exits himself Harry stares at the
empty doorway as DOBBYS PAINFUL SQUEALS ECHO from the
corridor

Mine I dont know what youre
talking about

I think you do sir I think you

slipped it into Ginny Weasleys

cauldron that day in Diagon Alley
Malfoy shoves the diary into Dobbys face then leans
close to Harry and with a nasty grin WHISPERS

He wheels sees Harry standing with one leg crossed His
right ankle is bare Instantly Malfoy charges forth

LUCIUS MALFOY
Youve lost me my servant

DOBBY

You shall not harm Harry Potter

Dobby steps between and -- BANG Malfoy flies backwards
lands in a crumpled heap Rising he stares murderously
at Harry

LUCIUS MALFOY

Mark my words Harry Potter
Youll meet the same sticky end as
your parents one of these days
They were meddlesome fools too

With that he turns storms off
