And shes known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it
She dont make false claims

- David Bowie Queen Bitch

Some people think little girls should be seen and not heard
But I think oh bondage up yours

-X-Ray Spex Oh Bondage Up Yours
We hear a familiar crackle over black as a TELEVISION SCREEN
turns on The screen is filled with black and white NEWS
FOOTAGE of a ROCKET blasting off into space when - BLAM The
MTV LOGO flashes on screen as guitars shred The MOON MAN
plants his flag waving in totally awesome neon graphics

WOMANS VOICE (VO)
Youre watching MTV Music
Television All day all night all
video music

VAN HALEN’S music video “JUMP” plays but we flip to MICHAEL
JACKSON’S Pepsi ad then JANE FONDA’S thigh workout and on
and on ‘til we land on

INT AMERICAN BANDSTAND - FOOTAGE

DICK CLARK standing next to a fresh-faced BLONDE 24 year-old
MADONNA She smiles out of breath beaming after performance
we can only imagine was as cool as her Attitude oozes from

her torn belly shirt golden bangles and wild peroxide hair

The crowd cheers feverishly as Dick tries to get a word in

DICK CLARK
Madonna its a real treat to
finally have you on our show

More cheering erupts Madonna blows kisses to her fans

DICK CLARK (CONT’D)
I was led to believe you’re from
New York or did you just go to
college here

MADONNA
No no I was born in Detroit and
Im a famed high school dropout

She throws a cheeky wink to the crowd Dick smiles awkwardly
DICK CLARK
We’re only a few weeks into the new
year but what are your goals for
1984 and the rest of your career

And without hesitation Madonna responds

MADONNA
To rule the world

She smiles beatifically and as the sound of CITY LIFE and CAR
HORNS rise up and take over the soundtrack we CUT TO
EXT NEW YORK CITY - HEART OF WINTER - DAY

Crowds of Yuppies Punks Wall Street Suits all hustle
against graffiti and trash lined streets Cabs honk boom
boxes blaring steam hissing from the subway grates below -
its the rhythm and soul of 1980s NEW YORK

CHRYON 1983 1 YEAR EARLIER

We track through these crowded streets on the back of a
WOMAN her short shaggy BROWN HAIR tied up in an elaborate
bow Her athletic body cuts through the crowds with
determination and loose hip swagger We get a sense of the
woman’s face from the expressions on the men passing her by -
a mixture of intrigue fear and lust

Tapping her fingers on her Walkman she blocks it all out

On the back of her oversized LEATHER JACKET we see the words
BOY TOY scribbled in the center A warning or badge of honor

INT RESTAURANT KITCHEN - DAY

The Woman opens her locker door obscuring her face She
throws her jacket over the locker door quickly followed by
her white lacy top Some of the kitchen workers can’t help
but stare as she changes so unabashedly in front of them

THE WOMAN
(sarcastic)
Get a good look fellas

Off her locker door SLAMMING-

INT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - NIGHT

SWOOSH Gilded doors swing open as we follow her into the
gaudy dining hall of the RUSSIAN TEA ROOM filled with ornate
flower bouquets old New York money and tourists

At the corner table a gaggle of BITCHY BALLERINAS from NYC
Ballet wait impatiently for their server

THE WOMAN (0S)
What can I get you started with

As the Bitchy Ballerinas lower their menus we finally reveal
our mysterious brunette to be

BITCHY BALLERINA 1
No way Madonna
MADONNA 23 immediately averts her green eyes hiding her
tired face behind a gruff pout boyish haircut and order
pad Swimming in an ill fitting uniform we can still
appreciate her unconventional beauty But one thing is for
sure she couldn’t be further from the vestiges of “fuck-me
pop stardom” we associate with her today

MADONNA
What am I supposed to know you

The Bitchy Ballerinas exchange looks then

BITCHY BALLERINA 2

(to Ballerina 1)
Wait the Madonna who Alvin threw
out of the company

BITCHY BALLERINA 1
(To Ballerina 2)
Oh no she quit remember To be a
“dancer” in Prague or was it Paris

BITCHY BALLERINA 3
(to Madonna)
I heard it was Paris - Burlesque
right

The girls laugh amongst themselves while DEMITRI her sleazy
shift manager watches her like a hawk She needs this job
She’s forced to swallow her pride But while depositing the
breadbasket she “accidentally” nudges a glass of water all
over Bitchy Ballerina 1

BITCHY BALLERINA 1
You bitch you did that on purpose

Madonna dabs at the spill saying quietly

MADONNA
I wanted to see if youd melt

BITCHY BALLERINA 1
What did you say

Demitri notices the commotion and darts over Fuck

DEMITRI
Ladies I’m sorry for the mess Let
me get you some of our famous St
Petersburg’s tea Least we can do
for the New York Ballet’s finest

Madonna forces a smile for Demitri and the table
MADONNA
Ill be back with your tea

DEMITRI
Grab a floral arrangement from the
back Table 7 is missing one
(to Ballerinas)
Good help is so hard to find

Madonna walks into the kitchen a volcano ready to erupt

INT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

As the doors swing closed behind her Madonna fires two hard
middle fingers up in the air like a jackhammer gone wild
FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU And of course that’s when
Demitri walks back in

INT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - COAT CHECK - NIGHT

Now exiled to coat check Madonna cradles a phone against her
ear tapping her pencil to the hold music glancing around to
make sure Demitri isn’t nearby

GLORIA (OVER PHONE)
Sire Records Nick Walkers’s
office

MADONNA
Gloria it’s Madonna Don’t tell me
he’s in a meeting

Gloria’s voice changes deeply annoyed
GLORIA (OVER PHONE)
Like I told you 20 minutes ago I

don’t have him He’1ll return-

MADONNA
Did you get my flowers

INTERCUT WITH

INT SIRE RECORDS OFFICES - GLORIA’S DESK - NIGHT

At GLORIA’s desk we see a floral bouquet It’s the bouquet
missing from table 7 Gloria touches them delicately

GLORIA
They’re from you There wasn’t a
card
MADONNA
It’s the least I could do to show
you how much I appreciate all your
hard work Gloria Woman to woman

Gloria looks at the extravagant bouquet in front of her A
long pause Madonna twirls the phone cord anxiously

GLORIA
Alright alright one moment

Madonna smiles One small victory in her shitty day

INT SIRE RECORDS - NICK WALKER’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Gloria walks in where she finds NICK WALKER snorting a bump
of coke No surprise Nick’s your typical slick ‘80s AandR guy
Vapid young and not nearly as smart as he thinks

NICK
(fuck off)
- yes
GLORIA

It’s Madonna Line 1

NICK
Fuck again Tell her I’ve left for
the evening

Gloria gives him a look patches in Madonna on SPEAKERPHONE
Nick is caught off guard He could murder Gloria

NICK (CONTD)
Babycakes how are you

MADONNA
If I didn’t know any better Id
think you were avoiding my calls

NICK
Babe you know after the holidays
it’s just back to back meetings
Did you have a relaxing break

MADONNA
You know I don’t take breaks Nick
Have you gotten the label to
reconsider releasing our album

Gloria flashes a post-it SHOW TONIGHT 11 PM
NICK
I’ll be at your show tonight why
don’t we talk then

MADONNA
That’s why I called I need you to
do something for me

NICK
Of course anything

He mimes a gun to his head What could she possibly want now

MADONNA
Bring the head honcho with you
Seymour needs to see us live It’s
the only way-

NICK
Look I’1l try but once Seymour
Stein’s made his mind up on an act
there’s little anyone can-

Suddenly the line cuts out

INT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - COAT CHECK - CONTINUOUS

MADONNA
Nick you there

Madonna turns to see Demitri with his thick fingers on the
phone cradle

DEMITRI
What’d I say about personal calls

Demitri closes the coat check door behind him He walks over
to Madonna placing his hands on her shoulders

DEMITRI (CONTD)

You know I’m hard on you because I
think of you like a daughter

Madonna cringes

DEMITRI (CONTD)
You’re so tense pushkin Relax

As Demitri slides his hands further down her shirt Madonna
slides out of his grasp gestures at the clock

MADONNA
Note taken Shift’s up anyway

And she’s OUT THE DOOR before Demitri can even form words

INT LE PETIT BAR - NIGHT

Dark and romantic Madonna is clearly out of place amongst
the swanky clientele At the table with her is LUKE
WELLINGTON annoyingly handsome in his Gordon Gekko power
suit He studies her from behind his wine glass intrigued

MADONNA
(shuffling papers)
So the Emmys as you know we’re
signed with Sire for our first
album but we’re not happy with the
speed at which things are moving

Luke leans in sliding closer Madonna continues to pitch

MADONNA (CONTD)
With the material we have and the
direction the market is going you
and EMI will make back the pickup
in a matter of months

LUKE
Youve got great eyes I see why
you’re the front woman

Madonna side eyes him Not sure if she’s reading him right

MADONNA
Thanks They make seeing easier

Luke laughs again He’s trying really hard

LUKE
They’ve got a great wine list here
Rare stuff I’1ll order us a bottle

Madonna flashes a smile hiding her frustration

MADONNA
Luke I’ve got several ideas how we
can re-vamp the mix I like several
producers on your roster -

Luke places his hand on Madonna’s stopping her

LUKE
Slow down babe You don’t have to
worry about the business side of

things That’s what I’m here for
(MORE)
LUKE (CONTD)

Let’s just ya know make this
more casual Get to know each other
a little Artist to Patron

MADONNA
I don’t follow

LUKE

At EMI we like to know our artists
on a personal level Makes for
better music don’t you think

MADONNA
Right

Madonna slides her hand back takes a sip of her water Fuck

MADONNA (CONTD)
Excuse me for a sec

Madonna grabs her backpack and heads for the bathroom Out of

Luke’s eye-line she continues walking PAST IT and OUT
through the kitchen grabbing a roll on her way out

EXT EAST VILLAGE - THE DANCETERIA NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
Madonna late pushes through a line of MTV cool kids punks
and yuppies all making their case to JIMMY the bouncer
manning the velvet rope The brick-walled venue doesn’t look
like much from the outside but the crowd suggests otherwise
This is DANCETERIA
Madonna pushes her way to front goes to unhook the rope
MADONNA
Hey have the rest of the boys
arrived

He holds up a clipboard

JIMMY
Name

MADONNA
Funny Come on Jimmy I’m late

Madonna tries again to walk past Jimmy

JIMMY
I’m not “Jimmy” Name
MADONNA
I perform here Regularly Are you
serious
He’s serious
NOT JIMMY

There’s a lot of people “with” the
bands tonight

MADONNA
No you don’t get it I’m in one of
the bands The Emmys

He waits for her name

MADONNA (CONTD)
(Begrudgingly)
Madonna Ciccone

DRUNK YUPPIES at the front of the line start to grow
impatient as Not Jimmy scans the list

DRUNK YUPPIE 1
Why don’t you do what every groupie
does and flash your tits

Madonna turns to fight when -

NOT JIMMY
No Madonna

She spins around

MADONNA
What Are you serious -

BAM Madonna is suddenly pushed back by BIANCA STONEWELL New
York’s “Club It-Girl” whose looks and street-cred warrant a
freeze-frame-glitter-in-slow-motion close up Shit if we
didn’t know any better we’d think Bianca was Madonna - with
her blonde hair vintage clothes and cut off gloves

Reality sets back in as Bianca and her entourage cut the line
and Not Jimmy unhooks the velvet rope

NOT JIMMY
Bianca ladies this way Your
table is ready

BIANCA
Thanks Billy Good to see you

Madonna picks herself up as people yell at her to move

MADONNA
I’m in the fucking band

INT DANCETERIA - THE MAIN STAGE - SIDE WINGS - NIGHT

Psyching themselves up with booze we see Madonna’s BANDMATES
like trading cards with statistics

On guitar DAN GILROY - a lanky dirty blonde wearing Buddy
Holly glasses that give him an edgy intellectual look A fun
drunk the guy with all the party plans Madonna’s BOYFRIEND

On bass his brother ED GILROY - a studly brunette in his
signature white collar shirt and checkered suspenders Self-
appointed road manager and stoner a bad combination

Twirling his drum sticks between his fingers - STEPHEN BRAY
black new wave and the only guy in the band who’s known
Madonna since her Detroit roots and doesn’t take her shit

Together they are THE EMMYS Finally Madonna arrives

STEPHEN
M you’re late Again

MADONNA
Stephen don’t The fucking bouncers
here always think I’m a groupie
(to Dan)
Dan I thought you were going to
talk to them about that

Dan swoops in with a BIG KISS and a bottle of Jameson

DAN
I did Told ‘em to look out for my
girl give her the star treatment

But Dan’s affection is lost on Madonna who’s got bigger
things to worry about Actually they all do

MADONNA
You guys see if Nicks’s here He’s
bringing Seymour Stein

The rest of the band shrugs in between sips of Dan’s Jameson
Their nonchalant attitudes rub Madonna the wrong way

MADONNA (CONTD)
SEYMOUR-STEIN-IS-COMING Head of
Sire Records So we can impress him
into actually you know releasing
our fucking album

ED
We get it M That’s why we gotta
stay chill Do our thing

DAN
You really should have a drink Get
the creative juices flowing

Stephen passes her the bottle but she brushes it off

STEPHEN
That guy from EMI coming tonight

Madonna looks away brushing it off Embarrassed

MADONNA
No They don’t share our vision

Ed smirks

ED
AKA he just took the meeting to try
and fuck you

Madonna ignores him She hates that he’s right

DAN
Well tonight I think we should
still try something new really wow
the crowd Like ending with a big
guitar solo or -

Madonna can’t even began to list the reasons that’s a
terrible idea A STAGE HAND comes out

STAGE HAND
You’re on in five

MADONNA
(flustered)
I gotta change We’re doing the
songs like we always do Stick to
the plan Got it

Madonna hurries off to change Dan takes another big swig of
whiskey He turns to the guys with his guitar

DAN
Just follow my lead Trust me
she’ll be cool with it

Stephen and Ed exchange looks This can’t be good

INT DANCETERIA - MAIN STAGE - NIGHT

Finally we see a Madonna we almost recognize Dramatic
eyebrows and devilish smile Great stage presence Still
there’s something about her that’s more punk than pop-star
Madonna and Dan chant the last lyrics to Everybody

MADONNADAN
Everybody come on you can do your
thing

Things are going accordingly to plan and even GOOD til
Dan suddenly LURCHES forward into a crazy guitar solo
throwing everyone off beat Dan swings his guitar around
wildly as Madonna tries to dance but his poor timing KNOCKS
HER BACK The song ends to limping cheers It was a mess

The house lights go up Madonna scans the crowd for Nick
Nothing Maybe it’s better he’s a no-show Then as the
curtain’s close she spots him by the bar Shit

INT DANCETERIA - GREEN ROOM - NIGHT

Thrift store couches cigarette smoke and everyone who is
anyone fill the unspoken “VIP” area We see an MTV Camera
crew wrapping up an interview with Bianca and her friends

BIANCA
If you really want to be in the
know you have to hit the clubs on
a Tuesday or Wednesday Wednesdays
are the new Fridays for sure

Madonna tries to make her way to the camera’s direction

MADONNA (0S)
That’s when anyone who matters
plays like the Emmys

But the reporter and cameraman cut their lights

MADONNA (CONTD)
(to the Reporter)
Want an exclusive with the band

The Reporter looks over to the guys oblivious to the free
press struggling to tap the keg Dan kicks the keg hard
fucking up his foot in the process Ed and Stephen laugh

REPORTER
(to his cameraman)
Let’s go get B-Roll outside

Bianca and her friends smirk pleased with themselves

BIANCA
Guess they got what they needed

Ed and Stephen walk over with a beer for Bianca and her
friends trying to impress them By Madonna’s expression we
can tell these are unwanted fake bitches on her turf

BIANCA (CONT’D)
Thanks for the VIP treatment guys
You guys always take such good care
of me and my girls

BIANCA’S FRIENDS
Thanks guys so sweet

ED
It’s no big deal Really

STEPHEN
(re camera crew)
So ah what was that all about

BIANCA’S FRIENDS
That was MTIV Duh

BIANCA
They’re getting test footage for a
new segment on night clubs I might
host it No big deal

Stephen and Ed ad-lib impressed Madonna rolls her eyes It
feels like Madonna is the only one who knows they’re being
used by Bianca Dan walks over to the group just as naive

BIANCA (CONT’D)
Nice ending tonight Dan I thought
your girl was going to go crowd
surfing for a second

DAN
Ha Id pay to see that

MADONNA
I’m not as big a fan of strangers
running their hands all over me as
you are Bianca

Madonna grabs Dan before he sits down

MADONNA (CONTD)
What was that shit

DAN
Relax it was a joke

MADONNA
No the guitar solo -

DAN
Yea I was just trying to give the
song new energy for Nick and
Seymour Surprise them

MADONNA
Yea that’s the problem
(exhausted)
We had a plan You can’t pull that
shit Not with Nick and Seymour
here Not ever

DAN
You’re not the only one with good
ideas I’m allowed to experiment I
know you think you’re the authority
on all music or whatever but
sometimes you’re wrong babe

With a kiss Dan turns back to the couch with the guys
Madonna left alone turns to look for Nick

MADONNA
(to herself)
I’m never wrong

INT DANCETERIA - DANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Madonna wanders out from the green room onto the dance floor
looking for Seymour and Nick Maybe it wasn’t him Madonna
turns to head back when Nick emerges from the bathroom a
random girl discreetly exiting after It’s showtime

MADONNA
Nick Over here

NICK
(lying)
M hey Great show tonight You
guys really mixed things up Wild

Madonna escorts Nick backstage to the green room

INT DANCETERIA - GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

MADONNA
Yea so wild Let’s sit down with
the guys Can I get you and Seymour
something to drink on the house
Where is the big guy anyway

NICK
You know I love you guys But I
couldn’t drag him out doll

Madonna processes that

MADONNA
Okay well we’ve got another show
tomorrow night Bring him around
11 I’ll get you guys a VIP table

Nick runs his hands through his hair distracted

NICK
I don’t think it’s gonna happen

MADONNA
I don’t understand You’re my AandR
guy right Don’t you want what’s
best for the band For me

Nick hesitates It’s not good news He bullshits

NICK
Of course I do but my hands are
tied Seymour didn’t like the final
mix I think the best thing is to
table the album for now revisit it
with him next quarter We’1ll talk
strategy later Good seeing you-

Nick spots his bathroom girl and turns to leave but Madonna
stops him She’s tired of being yanked around

MADONNA
Nick I know the mixing is shit
That’s why I wanted Seymour here to
convince him that we’re better than
what’s on that mix That was your
one job

Nick can suddenly feel everyone staring at them Bianca and
her friends watch from behind their beers smirking

Dan Ed and Stephen share a concerned look
NICK
Jesus Dan she on her period or
something Come get your woman
under control -

DAN
Babe come sit down -

MADONNA
No I’m not going to let a junior
executive derail everything I’ve
done the last year because he’s too
scared to talk to his boss

She turns her fire back to Nick

MADONNA (CONTD)
You’re going to bring Seymour down
here tomorrow night and I’m going
to fix this if you can’t I hope I
don’t have to remind you what’s at
stake here - billboard conferences
summer bookings air play

Nick rolls his eyes - he’s heard this all before

MADONNA (CONTD)
Not to mention all the time we’ve
spent at showcases promoting a
record no one can buy

Madonna knows her stuff but she’s underestimated Nick’s
threshold tonight He’s had enough of her shit

NICK
Let’s get some things clear
Madonna This is a business We’re
here to make money Girls like you
are a dime a dozen in the village
Don’t think we can’t just replace
you in a fucking second

MADONNA
You’re out of-

NICK

(cutting her off)
And Seymour isn’t here because he
doesn’t want to spend any more time
on another “Blondie” rip-off His
words not mine So the chances of
him reconsidering The Emmys at this
point are zip Bottom line

The news hits her like a punch to the gut Down on the ropes
tears bubble beneath the surface

DAN
Why is this the first time we’re
hearing about this Nick

NICK
I like you Dan Maybe I could have
pushed Seymour to reconsider if she
hadn’t been such a difficult bitch

And with that Nick leaves Madonna watches him go her eyes
burning a hole through the back of his head her fist curled
tighter and tighter Her mind racing -

LED ZEPPLIN (PRE-LAP)
(Screaming)
Ahhhhhayaahhhhhh

INT LOFT AFTER PARTY - NIGHT

Party-goers dance as Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song plays in
the background A full drunken celebration swirls around
Madonna as her bandmates smoke up oblivious Her expression
is unchanged replaying everything over and over again

ERIKA black stylish and sharp tongued has her arm around
Madonna There’s a bond between these two - they get each
other easily and immediately

STEPHEN
We don’t need Nick Fuck him We’ve
got a finished product Now we just
gotta sling it Old school

ERIKA
What do suits know about real music
anyway

ED

Yea they only understand
spreadsheets and cookie cutter
formulas We’1ll be okay

DAN
Look our album isn’t perfect but
it isn’t bad

Madonna can’t listen to this nonsense anymore She reaches
into her backpack pulls out a cassette

MADONNA
Oh really Dan It isn’t that bad

She leans over slides it into the sound system Everybody
starts to play over the speakers

It starts off promising like the live version we just heard

but the layering of weird horns bells and saxophones makes

everyone cringe in the room It’s very 80’s in the worst way
A PARTY GIRL walks over to the speakers and turns it off

PARTY GIRL
Ugh who put this garbage on

The guys share a look Fuck Panic sets in

ED

Shit I already spent my advance
STEPHEN

We all did
MADONNA

We’re fucked We’re so fucked
Madonna folds over like an accordion

DAN
This might be crazy but I know
this licensing dude we could sell
some of our songs too We could
make some quick cash if a
commercial uses it

STEPHEN
I mean if the album’s never coming
out
The guys seem to like this idea Madonna jumps up from the
couch she’s going to be sick

INT LOFT PARTY - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Madonna shoves her way in ignoring the line SLAMS the door
shut The girls she cut off BEAT their anger on the door

Fuck them She needs a moment
Panic setting in she closes her eyes fighting back the

tears She tilts her head back a deep breath She braces
herself against the sink refusing to break Deep breaths

MADONNA
If not you then who If not now
then when

Release Wiping away her smeared eyeliner she rummages
through the medicine cabinet Landing on a RED LIPSTICK she
puts it on and pockets it That’s better Game face intact
she takes one more deep breath and turns OFF the light

INT LOFT PARTY - NIGHT

Madonna exits the bathroom quietly She moves through the
party recalibrating when she notices everyone is dancing
Feeling it Loving it We know the song as David Bowies

Modern Love Madonna watches tapping along What

She grabs the album an idea forming as she heads
couch The guys don’t even notice her return too
to brainstorm their own half-baked solutions

STEPHEN
- If we hustle the tracks we don’t
sell I know some cool college
radio DJs wholl play it

Stephen passes the joint to Dan
DAN
Yea that could work Fake it ‘til

you make it It’s good enough

MADONNA (OS)
Good enough is not good enough

is this

back to the
busy trying

They all turn high and surprised by her sudden return

ED
Okay so what do you suggest we do

Madonna tosses him David Bowie’s LET’S DANCE album

MADONNA
What if we got him

ED
Bowie

MADONNA
(pointing to the sleeve)
No idiot Nile Rodgers The guy
who produced it

STEPHEN
As in the Nile Rodgers Of Chic

MADONNA
Yeah why not He’s perfect

The band doesn’t follow She spells it out

MADONNA (CONTD)
We need someone undeniable attached
to the re-mix for Sire to give it a
second listen If they won’t listen
to me they’1ll listen to him

The band trades looks This girl is out of her mind

DAN
Nick could never get him for us

ED
(to himself)
Especially not after tonight

MADONNA
Who said anything about Nick

INT NILES RODGERS’ OFFICES - DAY

The sleek offices of Nile Rodgers Gold and platinum records
line the walls Sister Sledge’s “We Are Family” Chic’s “Good
Times” Diana Ross’ “I’m Coming Out” Classics

At the front a posh RECEPTIONIST answers the phone while
opening mail Unsolicited cassette tapes in envelope after
envelope And every single one goes right in the trash

RECEPTIONIST
No Nile doesn’t have any
availability ‘til next year thats

The receptionist looks up to see Madonna walking in Madonna
throws down her leather jacket on the receptionist’s desk

RECEPTIONIST (CONTD)
Can I help you

MADONNA
I’m here to see Nile

RECEPTIONIST
Do you have an appointment

Madonna leans over the desk checking out the receptionist’s
schedule touching her pencils

MADONNA
He’s expecting me

The receptionist forces a smile moving her schedule book and
pencils away from Madonna

RECEPTIONIST
Name

MADONNA
Just tell him Madonnas here

The receptionist stares back blankly

MADONNA (CONTD)
As in from The Emmys

Madonna grabs her jacket and heads for the door leading back
into Nile’s offices but the door BUZZES and LOCKS Madonna
pulls on the doors but they don’t budge

The receptionist holds down a button at her desk

RECEPTIONIST
Right I dont have a “Madonna” on
the schedule Youll have to come
back when you have an appointment

Madonna runs her hands through her hair hiding her
frustration debating her next move

MADONNA
This is about a very important
album-

RECEPTIONIST

Then have your reps mail in your
submission I’1ll make sure it gets
taken very seriously

Madonna looks at the trash bin filled to the brim Great

INT JIMMY’S DINER - UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

Madonna flips through the New York Post nursing the same cup
of coffee from the last three hours Stephen arrives sulking
into the booth across from her

STEPHEN
Can you tell me what the hell I’m
doing above 34th street Had to

Madonna folds down her paper and flips it around to Stephen

MADONNA

Avenue tonight

STEPHEN

EXT HUBERT’S - PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

Madonna and Stephen wait outside the very exclusive French
bistro amongst a sea of FANS and PAPARAZZI

STEPHEN
I guess other people read Page Six

MADONNA
Shut up and focus

A town car pulls up to the curb and a couple of EXECUTIVES
exit shortly followed by CHER and NILE RODGERS

STEPHEN
Shit is that Cher

Madonna has Stephen push forward through the crowd Stephen
holds their CASSETTE TAPE in his hand and extends it out
toward Nile when Cher reaches out to sign it instead

CHER
The Emmys

Madonna pulls the tape out of Cher’s hands Cher shoots her a
dirty look Madonna grabs Nile’s arm

MADONNA
Nile weve got a deal with Sire
Records to put out our album We’ve
got the best raw songs you’ve ever
heard we just need a killer
producer like you to re-mix it

NILE
Thanks honey I’ll take a listen

Nile passes it off to his ASSISTANT Cher turns back

CHER
Might want to rethink the name

Nile Cher enter the restaurant Just as Madonna and Stephen
think theyve accomplished their mission Madonna sees Niles
Assistant THROWING THEIR DEMO IN THE TRASH She grabs him

MADONNA
What do you think you’re doing

NILE’S ASSISTANT
Isn’t it clear enough Fuck off

EXT RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - KITCHEN - DAY

SLAM Madonna lays a tray down of half eaten food She turns
to see if any of her co-workers are nearby then furiously
DEVOURS the left-overs TIFFANY enters throwing a perfectly
good STEAK SANDWICH in the trash

INT ERIKAS APARTMENT - DAY

Madonna in uniform paces around eating the STEAK SANDWICH
Erika nurses a cup of coffee and a hangover splitting her
attention between MTV and her friend’s latest meltdown

MADONNA
Amateurs I’m working with idiots
I should just get rid of them all

ERIKA
Firing your boyfriend doesn’t sound
like the best plan

MADONNA
I’m doing all the work Erika If it
wasn’t for me Dan and his stupid
brother would still be playing in
pool halls in Queens and squatting
in that artist commune

ERIKA
Didn’t you get them kicked out of
there anyway

MADONNA
(deflecting)
It was the kick in the ass they
needed to get serious -

ERIKA
Holy shit Check it out

Madonna turns sees Erika totally transfixed by NEW ORDER’s
music video for Confusion A bearded courier walks the band’s
latest song (on cutting edge reel-to-reel tape) through a
packed NYC club to the DJ booth

ERIKA (CONT’D)

MADONNA
Wait what What club

ERIKA

Madonna watches the screen a plan forming

MADONNA
Funwhat

ERIKA
There might be a flyer on the
table Aspirin pronto

Madonna walks over to Erika’s drafting table shuffles
through some sketches and finds the flyer - a creepy clown
logo smiling up at her FUN HOUSE written in bubbly type

MADONNA
Fun House

Madonna tosses her the bottle eyes locked on the screen as
the pale English band hangs out in the Fun House DJ booth
with the attractive young DJ

ERIKA
Yeah that’s the one DJ was
incredible That’s him up there
with the band Guess that dude is
blowing up Kinda cute huh

MADONNA

Erika throws back the aspirin searches her fragmented brain

ERIKA

INT BENITEZ APARTMENT - SOUTH BRONX - DAY

-To that same eerily smiling CLOWN LOGO on a record crate
Scribbled on it the words JB We pull out and we’re ina
bedroom filled with music equipment records baseball
memorabilia and the Puerto Rican flag hanging over a bare
mattress on the floor He’s a minimalist

We follow the sound of an ANSWERING MACHINE

INT BENITEZ APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Where we find FUN HOUSE DJ JOHN “JELLYBEAN” BENITEZ A
stocky build but boyishly handsome He tucks his silky black
hair behind his well trained ears

BEEP - a message from EMI Records about re-mixing another
Latin-Funk album Delete BEEP - A ditsy girl’s voice rattles
on about his set last night Delete

Jellybean listens sleepily surrounded by family photos
crucifixes and dainty floral furniture Not what you would
expect to see in a cool DJ’s apartment

INT BENITEZ APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

Jellybean rummages for food in the fridge knocking over a
container of orange juice in the process Shit

MAMA BENITEZ (0S)

Mama Benitez enters looks her son up and down Not
impressed DEBBIE his older sister in her nursing scrubs
pushes Jellybean out of the way for milk late for work

DEBBIE

Jellybean shoots her a look Thanks for blowing my cover

MAMA BENITEZ
John I don’t like you out all
night Why can’t you have a real
job like Debbie Go back to school-

She swats him affectionately with a newspaper Family

JELLYBEAN
Ah pues bien All right I just got

career Besides I’m paying all the
bills right Helping Debbie with
her nursing loans

His mother kisses her rosary a prayer under her breath
DEBBIE
(trying to help)
He was even on MTV just last week -
Mama Benitez scoffs at that She rolls her eyes
MAMA BENITEZ
You just love breaking my heart
with your disco music
Jellybean’s turn to roll his eyes
JELLYBEAN
Disco’s dead Ma Everyone knows

that Love you

And with a kiss he dashes off to his room to avoid the rest
of what might follow

INT SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

Jellybean rides the subway to his gig combing through his
crates checking his list surrounded by graffiti and
garbage Looks like a scene out of ‘The Warriors’

A homeless guy lays passed out a couple seats over A
panhandler walks by asking for change with a monkey Even a
COUPLE CUTE GIRLS eyeing him on the other side of the car
But nothing can distract Jellybean before his set

EXT THE FUN HOUSE DANCE CLUB - NIGHT

Jellybean moves past a long line of goths costumed dancers
and trendy college students looking for a wild night All of
them eager to enter the circus-themed dance club - FUN HOUSE
We see the line’s attention shift to Jellybean He’s what
they’re here for Already a legend in the making

FUN HOUSE BOUNCER
‘Sup JB Back’s open for you

Jellybean gives him a nod without even looking up Focused
We follow Jellybean as he turns into an alleyway slipping
into the club through the back door

INT FUN HOUSE - BARDANCE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

Jellybean moves through the dark and intoxicating dance
floor surrounded by neon signs and neon hair It’s like
looking at a Keith Haring painting on acid

Jellybean preps his set at the DJ booth as the other DJ gets
ready to transition out They work in a plexiglass sanctuary
on stage surrounded by VIP booths Jellybean fumbles with his
massive crates and tape-reels just as Madonna and Erika walk
in Madonna clocks Jellybean Sizing him up

MADONNA
(unimpressed)
That’s him

ERIKA
When you’re still dancing at 4 AM
remember you said that

Madonna and Erika lean against the bar as Jellybean finally
takes the mic

JELLYBEAN
Fun House looking live

CROWD
Jellybean Jellybean

Madonna rolls her eyes at Erika But the crowd is already
stirred into a frenzy and bum rushes the dance floor

JELLYBEAN
What’s that Fun House I can’t
hear you

The beat starts to swell Madonna’s starting to come around
to it but isn’t sold ‘til

CROWD
JEEEELLLLYYYBEEEAAN ROCKS THE
HOUSE JELLYBEAN ROCKS THE HOUSE

THE BEAT DROPS His remix hits the floor like a rush of
cocaine Madonna takes in the crowd the music She’s liking
what she’s hearing

MADONNA
We’re getting on that stage

INT FUN HOUSE - VIP SECTIONSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Madonna pushes her way through the crowd up to the stage
where she finds Jellybean immersed in his set surrounded by
a SECOND LEVEL VIP section It’s littered with artists young
record execs and of course Bianca MTV news cameras filming
her and her friends again

MADONNA
(disgusted)
Bianca

Madonna approaches the SUITED GUY manning the rope Tosses
her hair bites her lip He leans in whispers sensually

SUIT GUY
I’m gay

Madonna’s face falls Madonna scans the room looking for
another angle

ERIKA
So now what

-When she locks onto a dance-off forming in front of the
stage - BINGO

MADONNA
Just follow my lead

INT FUN HOUSE - DANCE FLOOR

Madonna pushes through the crowd to the edges of the dance
off pulling Erika behind her

We watch as tough street dudes BREAK DANCE Madonna studies
the competition It’s like trying to find the right time to
jump into an intense game of double dutch

ERIKA
M I don’t know about this These
dudes aren’t playing around

MADONNA
Neither am I

Madonna without looking back PULLS on the shirt of a MALE
DANCER about to step into the circle cutting him off as she
JUMPS INTO THE CENTER The guys watch her skeptical but
things turn as Madonna busts out her classical training It’s
like Flash-Dance on hip-hop steroids

A GUY jumps into the circle with her trying to grind but
she rejects him hard with fancy foot work crushing him like
a used cigarette butt under her heel

CROWD
Dayum Oooo Booya

ERIKA
Get it M

This is her moment Madonna now commanding the whole dance
floor gets the attention of MTV reporters on stage

MTV REPORTER
(to Camera Man)
Let’s get footage of this

Bianca and her friends stand to watch Even Jellybean can’t
help but notice the new queen of the dance floor

Madonna makes her final strike and JUMPS on stage in front of
a shocked Bianca The room cheers Madonna on

INT FUN HOUSE - STAGE

Just as she’s made it Madonna clocks a BOUNCER about to
throw her off stage but she’s come too far to let it end
here With the whole room watching camera rolling Bianca

and Madonna square off in a game of chicken

Madonna pulls the cherry out of Bianca’s rum and coke

MADONNA
Wednesday is for taste makers am I
right
She puts the Cherry in her mouth Winks to the reporter
filming The Bouncer approaches palming the camera down with
his hand The reporter signals to cut the lights

BOUNCER
You can’t be up here

The Bouncer looks to Bianca who’s aware all eyes are on her
BIANCA
(reluctantly)
Rick it’s cool She’s with me
The Bouncer backs off The camera turns back on
BIANCA (CONT’D)
(to the reporter)
Give us a minute

Bianca pulls Madonna aside dropping the friendly act

BIANCA (CONTD)
I don’t know what you want -

Madonna fully aware the camera is still on KISSES BIANCA ON
THE LIPS Her friends gasp

MADONNA
Nothing you got but thanks

Madonna moves off smirking as Bianca pulls a KNOTTED CHERRY
STEM out of her mouth horrified

INT DJ BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

Madonna steps into Jellybean’s plexiglass work station She
flips through his records He’s busy putting on the next
song As it starts to play -

MADONNA
Youve got some good shit here
Who’s your source

Jellybean doesn’t look over

MADONNA (CONTD)
Hey buddy I’m talking to you

Jellybean still ignores her Bianca and her friends watch
from their table snickering

Irked Madonna SNAPS Jellybean’s headphones

JELLYBEAN
Aye hot discs here you can’t just
come up and-

Jellybean finally looks at the wild stallion in front of him

MADONNA
Dont you know who I am

JELLYBEAN
Crazy

MADONNA
Im the next big thing

Madonna pulls out her cassette tape from her bra

MADONNA (CONTD)
It’s the only thing your set is
missing They love us at
Danceteria

JELLYBEAN
Do you push your way on stage at
Danceteria too

MADONNA
No People push their way to see
me Play it

He smirks He kinda likes her

JELLYBEAN
One I don’t play cassette tapes in
my sets and two I never play a
song ‘til I’ve had a chance to
listen to it Alone

Jellybean reaches to put her tape in his crate but Madonna
grabs his arm She can’t afford another tape in the trash

MADONNA
If you’re not gonna listen to it
just give it back

He pulls his arm back pulling Madonna in close to him An
unexpected cool move on his part

JELLYBEAN
Do I look like a liar
Madonna lets go of him unsure of her next move then-

She turns and pulls out a silver sharpie from her back
pocket extending the SLEEVE OF HER LEATHER JACKET

MADONNA
Sign it
He hesitates
MADONNA (CONTD)

By the looks of it you have one
minute before the song ends so

sign it

JELLYBEAN
Why

MADONNA
Collateral

Jellybean laughs He signs her sleeve JOHN BENITEZ

JELLYBEAN
Nice doing business with you

What’s her name

MADONNA
The pleasure was all yours

The SONG ENDS as predicted Jellybean turns and races to flip
on the next track as Madonna exits the booth She exhales
This might actually work Jellybean spins around but she’s
gone He exits the booth scanning the crowd for her when he
senses Bianca and her friends staring at him

JELLYBEAN
You know that girl

BIANCA BIANCAS FRIENDS
No not at all She’s not with us
JELLYBEAN
Too bad

Off Bianca and her friends’ disbelief

INT THE MUSIC BUILDING - EMMYS’ REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY

The Emmys’ rehearsal space does double-duty as Madonna and
Dans apartment Dan’s passed out behind Stephen’s drum set
from another night of rigorous “practice” Madonna dressed
and ready for the day grabs her Walkman backpack and a
HIGH POWER STAPLE GUN She dips her hand into a glass jar
labeled “FOOD and sighs It’s basically empty

EXT EAST VILLAGE - COPY and MAILING SHOP - DAY
Madonna flirts with a NERDY CLERK examining paper stock

MADONNA
I was thinking of something a
little thicker

NERDY CLERK
Yeah sure let me see what we have
in the back

With the coast clear Madonna puts on her sunglasses opens a
Xerox machine and starts scanning her face Cool black and
white images of her face start spitting out of the copier

INT BENITEZ APARTMENT —- DAY

Just like when we first met him Jellybean’s still up from
his night DJing Breakfast scattered around him he searches
through his latest vinyl finds and record company submissions
for something to put on His version of weekend read

Jellybean puts on a funk album listening for a verse or two
Not great He turns it off tossing it into the “reject”
pile which already has a number of records and tapes

He opens up an envelope from AandM records A tape from a new
signing He sticks it in and sappy sweet pop fills the air

JELLYBEAN
And no

That one goes to the reject pile Jellybean finally reaches
for the Emmys’ tape Studies the cheesy ransom note style
lettering He unfolds an insert a black and white photo of
the band Madonna despite her short brown boyish hair and
terrible outfit still has something about her

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
All right let’s see what you got

He puts the tape on The first track comes on Everybody And
just like at the party it doesn’t go over well

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
Nope You got one more chance

Jellybean fast-forwards to the next song Lucky Star starts
to play This track unlike Everybody sounds pretty cool

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
Okay good solid beat

But just as Jellybean starts getting into it overproduced
horns and synthesizers kick in alongside cheesy guitars

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
Oh come on trumpets

Jellybean stops the song and pulls out his YAMAHA DX-7
KEYBOARD Rewinds and starts the song over

Jams over the song with an airy twinkle effect Looping it
he moves over to his DRUM PAD He pads along emphasizing the
catchy beat

The cleaner beat and piano riffs transform the song into
something we can really dance to Even Jellybean can’t help

dancing along Just throw in the harmony with Madonna’s
vocal

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
Star Light Star Bright-

DEBBIE (0S)
That’s catchy JB Cute moves

Debbie watches from his doorway

JELLYBEAN
Hey Debbie Ma back too

DEBBIE
Nah But she’s praying for you
Who’s the girl you listening to

Jellybean tosses her the cassette

JELLYBEAN
I have no idea But I like her

He rolls over reaches for the PHONE

INT THE MUSIC BUILDING - THE EMMYS’ REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY
RING RING - Dan stirs waiting for the phone to stop ringing
When it doesnt Dan gets up knocks over a cymbal Pissed
he rips the phone from the wall Now it’s silent

DAN
That’s better

As Dan goes back to his slumbering we cut to

INT JELLYBEANS APARTMENT - SAME

Jellybean listening as the line goes dead Calls the number
on the tape again and now it just rings and rings WTF

EXT EAST VILLAGE - DAY

Madonna walks past several marquees passing CBGB and STUDIO
54 tapping along to the music in her Walkman She stares at
the billings for the upcoming shows Talking Heads Patti
Smith Duran Duran ugh Blondie

STAMP - Madonna staples the black and white copies of her
face over Blondie’s music billings

Actually she’s papered the whole neighborhood with flyers
On the flyer we read THE EMMYS - DANCETERIA SATURDAY NIGHT
INT DANCETERIA - MAIN STAGE - NIGHT

Madonna and the band finish singing Lucky Star to a full
house The crowd cheers and as the lights go down Madonna

sees Jellybean at the bar in back What’s he doing here

He sees her looking holds up a flyer with her face on it
She turns away hiding her smile Dan leans into the mic

DAN
Hey everyone we’re the Emmys
Thanks for coming out we’re going
to do one last song-
And just like that one of Dan’s guitar strings SNAPS

DAN (CONT’D)
Fuck

Madonna grabs the mic from Dan It’s showtime

MADONNA
(Pointing to Stephen)
Alright EVERYBODY

Dan tries to re-string up as fast as he can while the rest
of the band starts playing Everybody

But this time Madonna’s the one going rogue

MADONNA (CONTD)
I know youve been waiting yeah
Ive been watching you yeah

Madonna spontaneously JUMPS off stage grabbing people from
the audience getting the whole room to dance with her

MADONNA (CONTD)
Everybody come on dance and sing
Everybody get up and do your thing

Jellybean is mesmerized by how she works the room The song
comes to a dramatic end and the crowd claps wildly Dan Ed
and Stephen soak in the applause

STEPHEN
(to Ed and Dan)
Woo That was sick

Ed throws his arm around his brother stoked

ED
Now that’s how you end a set

Dan smiles back with shy agreement He watches Madonna work
the room with envious admiration

INT DANCETERIA - BAR - LATER

Madonna approaches Jellybean at the bar while the band pack
up their instruments Dan keeping a jealous eye on her

MADONNA
You never called I was starting to
think I was going to have come over
and collect

JELLYBEAN
Ive never seen someone have such
stage presence

MADONNA
What can I say I’m a natural So
what’d you think of our tape
Madonna doesn’t waste time but neither does Jellybean

JELLYBEAN
The mix is a mess You’re ska on
one track overly poppy on another
Lucky Star almost worked but
that’s about it

MADONNA
Well the label loves us They’re
super excited about our potential

JELLYBEAN
You guys are better live I’1l
admit Wasn’t expecting that

That stings but she keeps her cool
MADONNA
Yeah well I guess we haven’t found
anyone who can capture our genius
Anyway thanks for stopping by man
Madonna turns to leave Jellybean processes
JELLYBEAN (0S)
It’s saveable though Have you
thought about doing a remix

She’s got him

MADONNA
No why-

Dan swoops in throwing his arm around his girl He looks

Jellybean up and down not sure what to make of him yet

DAN
Hey man I’m Dan

Jellybean doesn’t want trouble They shake hands

JELLYBEAN
John Great set

MADONNA
We’re just talking about the tape-

DAN
What about it

JELLYBEAN
I was just saying your album needs
to capture the energy of you guys
live Maybe a couple more up-tempo
songs to dance to strip down the
vocals-

DAN
What’s wrong with the vocals

JELLYBEAN
It’s a bit crowded with you both
singing Have you thought of just
her singing

Jellybean hits an unknown sore spot for Dan Madonna braces

DAN
M can I talk to you in private

JELLYBEAN
M That short for Emmy

MADONNA
Madonna - Don’t leave

Jellybean smiles behind his beer That can’t be her real
name Before he can do more damage Madonna drags Dan into

INT DANCETERIA - PHOTOBOOTH - CONTINUOUS
She throws the curtain closed

MADONNA
I need you to just hear me out for
a second Do you know who that is

DAN
No

MADONNA
He’s the hottest DJ out there right
now and believe it or not he
liked our set

DAN
So What do we need him for I’m
handling everything
(off her look)
I will

Dan gently moves Madonna’s hair She’s not convinced

MADONNA
John just might be the only guy
with the right name and sound to
save our album He’s got a real
vision -

DAN
Oh the “vision” that involves
dropping my vocals No way

MADONNA
Dan without me there wouldn’t
even be an album to fight over So
let’s just hear him out -

DAN
Fuck you ever think that maybe
were in this mess because of you

MADONNA
I’m doing this for all of us -

DAN
Forget it just do whatever you
want You always do

Dan storms out Madonna inhales deeply puts a smile on

INT DANCETERIA - BAR -— CONTINUOUS
-And emerges to find Jellybean watching Dan go

JELLYBEAN
Do you need to go after him

Madonna considers it then
MADONNA
Are you afraid of heights
INT THE MUSIC BUILDING - THE EMMYS’ REHEARSAL SPACE - NIGHT

We hear the sound of several padlocks opening over black as
Madonna curses and stumbles in the dark recording space

MADONNA
Just gotta grab something quick

As Madonna starts digging through piles of clothes and boxes
Jellybean walks delicately through the studio trying to
avoid the food containers and music gear

JELLYBEAN
I didn’t know you could live ina
rehearsal space

MADONNA
I live and breath music Makes
sense to be close to the studio
when inspiration strikes

JELLYBEAN
But it can’t be legal right

Madonna hands him a BRICK and a beer

MADONNA
Do I look like I follow the rules

Jellybean looks down at the brick About to ask but Madonna
is already out the door What has he gotten himself into

JELLYBEAN
Shit

EXT THE MUSIC BUILDING - ROOF TOP - NIGHT
Madonna waves Jellybean up grabs the brick out of his hand

MADONNA
Learnt the hard way you need that

She props the rooftop door open with a brick The place is
deserted with a great view of the city

MADONNA (CONTD)
So John Jellybean Mr Jellybean

JELLYBEAN
Just call me Jellybean Everyone
does anyway

Jellybean steers clear of the edge Madonna leans against it
Sizing him up she moves closer to him

MADONNA
(re her jacket)
You see this name here On my
shoulder

JELLYBEAN
(reading)
Pearl Lang

MADONNA
Creative director for the Modern
Dance Theater I dropped out of
Michigan to dance for her company
gave up a full ride Then I show up
and it turns out they didn’t need
an understudy after all

JELLYBEAN
You just showed up without a plan

MADONNA
My plan was to dance in New York
So I came I don’t wait for
opportunities I make them

Moving closer

MADONNA (CONTD)
Every day I’d wait outside of her
studio telling her she had to hire
me and every day she’d say no

JELLYBEAN
But she finally caved and let you
audition right

MADONNA
No But fuck her I’m still here
and doing something better

Madonna turns looking out on the city She looks beautiful
Jellybean looks away Keep it professional

JELLYBEAN
So all these signatures - what are
they A hit list

MADONNA
More or less

Madonna jumps up onto the ledge walking along it Jellybean
blanches grabs her when she leans over a bit too far

JELLYBEAN
Jesus

MADONNA
(with a grin)
I thought you weren’t scared of
heights

JELLYBEAN
Well I am More or less

A charged moment as he helps her down and they disentangle
Jellybean grabs for another beer trying to keep a distance

MADONNA
I’m going to get straight to the
point I did my research on you
You’re not just great at spinning
records Everybody’s hounding you
for mixes - AandM EMI Sire all the
big boys You’re one hit mix away
from being a full on producer

JELLYBEAN
Then you should know I just don’t
work with anyone

Madonna smiles at that one

MADONNA
You wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t
something special

Jellybean drinks more of his beer Thinking

JELLYBEAN
Maybe you’ve got something You’re
great live but on tape not so
hot How do I know that even with
my help you can deliver the goods
I’ve got a rep to think of

A challenge Madonna likes it

MADONNA
So do I But I’m going take a risk
on you and make you a deal

JELLYBEAN
(Laughing)
I’m the risk

MADONNA
If you re-mix my current album and
Sire likes it I promise you can be
the sole producer on my next album
But the deal expires in 10 9 8

She extends her hand He doesnt

JELLYBEAN
And why would I wanna do that for
someone who doesn’t even have a
playable single

Last chance She goes ALL IN

MADONNA
Because you’re the first Latin DJ
to break out of genre in a heavily
white industry and I’m a driven
woman in all boys club We’re both
outsiders but I’m willing to work
the system from within Are you

Jellybean smiles Can you believe this girl Can’t help but
shake her hand Deal

INTEXT DUNKIN’ DONUTS - STREET - MORNING

Madonna grabs two coffees from the counter Jellybean reaches
to pay but Madonna stops him

MADONNA
We’re good I used to work here
It’s on the house right Eddy

She pulls a flyer out of her backpack and hands it to EDDY
who reluctantly takes it A favor she’s starting to abuse

MADONNA (CONTD)
You’re the best hang this up will
you

She links arms with Jellybean and pulls him outside

JELLYBEAN
Thanks for the coffee

MADONNA
Anything for my new partner

JELLYBEAN
Look I have some final conditions
before I fully agree to our deal

MADONNA
Hit me

JELLYBEAN
One I only work with real
musicians If it’s my name on the
mix everything has to be tight
Everyone at their best Sober

MADONNA
Got it
44

JELLYBEAN
Two You’ve got to trust me
completely We’re going to be on a
tight schedule between my other
gigs It’s not always going to be a
two-way street Egos and personal
drama will slow us down

MADONNA
Done Best behavior

JELLYBEAN

Three We need to be in a real
studio with my team Your budget
setup isn’t going to cut it I’ll
drop my fee down but I gotta eat
and pay my engineer Three grand
should cover us for a two week
session

Madonna almost chokes on her coffee Three thousand dollars
She knows she doesn’t have the money and the label won’t pay

She stops him and stares him straight in the eye

MADONNA
Three grand and you deliver me
something the label will one-
hundred percent release

JELLYBEAN
You live up to your end of the
deal I’ll mix you a hit

She smiles liking this plan She suddenly GRABS HIM -
pulling him into a NEARBY ALLEYWAY

MADONNA
C’mon

Pulling out a RED SPRAY CAN from her bag she sprays
something on a wall off-screen Tosses Jellybean the can

MADONNA (CONTD)
(off his look)
It’s not official unless it’s in
writing

Jellybean laughs shakes the spray can

JELLYBEAN
Nice tag

As Jellybean sprays we see Madonna’s tag name - BOY TOY - as
Jellybean signs his own tag next to it

EXTINT CANAL BAR - NIGHT

Crowded and hip Madonna paces outside hesitating to go in
She jumps up and down psyching herself up while Nick and a
MODEL BIMBO sip fancy cocktails at a table near the back

NICK
With your voice youll be just as
amazing a singer as you’re a model

Just then Nick spots MADONNA at the front door

NICK (CONTD)
Oh for fuck’s sake

Nick tries to hide from Madonna but she’s already got him
locked in She struts over to Nick’s table

MADONNA
Gloria said you’d be here

The Bimbo smiles unsure what to make of the situation
Madonna takes the olive out of his drink chews on it The
Bimbo chimes in annoyed

BIMBO
And you are

MADONNA
This your girlfriend She’s taller
than I remember

It isn’t Nick shifts in his seat
NICK
We’re kind of talking business

right now M

MADONNA
Perfect

Madonna pulls up a chair sits on it backwards
MADONNA (CONTD)
‘Cause I’ve got a great guy to re-

mix the record

NICK
Did I not make it clear -

MADONNA
You hear of John “Jellybean”
Benitez

Nick’s face changes He’s clearly heard of this guy

NICK
From Fun House Yeah The Post did
a piece on him But he only does
passion projects We tried to get
him before and he wouldn’t bite

MADONNA
Then youd be happy to know he dug
the Emmys and is worth every penny
of the three grand he’s asked for

Nick chokes on his drink

NICK
Danielle excuse us

Nick gets up pulls Madonna over to the bar across the room

NICK (CONTD)
I don’t know how you got Jellybean
to agree to work with you if you
fucked him or what but your
funding is gone Zero Zilch
(off her look)
Even if I wanted to give it to you

Madonna swallows her pride smiles playing to his ego

MADONNA
Nick are you really going to let
our little fight hold a hit record
hostage You could be the guy to
bring Jellybean into Sire Succeed
where others tried and failed

Nick runs his hair through his hair anxiously Thinking

NICK
Alright I guess I can get you
studio time at Sire during off
hours but that’s it You’ll need
your own engineer

MADONNA
What about the three grand

Patting her on the back

NICK
Youll figure something out babe

Nick returns to his date leaving Madonna at the bar fuming
She sucks it up and flags down a BARTENDER

MADONNA
Bottle of champagne Whatever’s
most expensive

She waves over to Danielle and Nick Danielle waves back
Nick raises his glass grinning through his teeth Idiots

MADONNA (CONTD)
Put it on that guy’s tab

Madonna throws a New York Post article onto the console The
cover shows Jellybean at Fun House dead center The
headline “The Hottest DJs in New York”

DAN

guy “Mr Vision”

Madonna pours champagne in various mugs and glasses and
passes to the guys for a cheers

MADONNA
To our way out and to me for being
a genius

The guys grumble but hey it’s champagne And maybe she did
find a way Hope begins to spring anew Smiles cracking

MADONNA (CONTD)
Now we just have to find the three
grand to pay him

And that champagne just started tasting sour as the band
looks at her incredulously

INT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - KITCHEN - DAY

Madonna sings a familiar song exhausted but happy She holds
up trays full of dirty dishes dumping them into the sink

MADONNA (CONTD)

without holes in it

Madonna ignores their snickering It’s only when she sees the
SHIFT BOARD that she gets upset Her name SCRATCHED OUT and
replaced with Tiffany and Mary for all the dinner shifts

INT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM - BACK OFFICE - DAY
Madonna storms up to Demitri who’s lounging in his office

MADONNA
The fuck Demitri Why do Tiffany
and Mary have all my dinner shifts

Demitri places his hands on Madonna’s shoulders Madonna
keeps her game face on

DEMITIRI
Night shifts are for our top
waiters Mary and Tiffany earned it-

MADONNA
I’ve been here a year You know I
can’t live without the night tips

DEMITIRI
Should’ve thought of that before
you cut out early last week

MADONNA
Are you kidding me I was already
pulling a double shift because you
gave Tiffany the weekend off

DEMITIRI
Well maybe we can come up with
some kind of arrangement

Demitri slides his hands down Madonna’s dress She PUSHES him
into a rack of uniforms pulling it down on top of him

MADONNA
Dream on you fuckin’ pig

Seeing Demitri on the ground Madonna can’t help herself
heaving a file cabinet onto him It slams down files
spilling everywhere

That done Madonna struts out as Demitri SCREAMS after her
DEMITRI

Youre fired you bitch You’re
fucking fired

EXT THE RUSSIAN TEA ROOM STREETS - DAY

Madonna gets enough distance between her and the restaurant
to be out of view She kicks a trash can hard and SCREAMS
Trash flies everywhere But it’s New York so no one cares

Again as before she sucks it up Recalibrates
MADONNA
(under her breath)
If not you then who If not now
then when

She straightens up Clocks a flashing sign for a pawn store
down the street - BUY TRADE SELL Makes a decision

CUT TO

HUSTLE MONTAGE

- At the studio Dan and Ed come back to find half of Dan’s
guitar collection GONE with a note from Madonna “You can buy
them back when we’re rich - XOXO M”

- Madonna at a pawnshop with Dan’s gear She counts the cash
- Madonna attempts to bartend with Erika at a dive bar We
watch as male customers line up for drinks from Madonna who
struggles She smiles and flirts as the unsuspecting
customers tip graciously only to spit their drinks out

- Madonna’s thrown out of the bar Erika looks back “Sorry”

- Madonna in only a bathrobe steps into a room full of
pretentious ART STUDENTS She turns to the INSTRUCTOR

MADONNA
I need to be paid in advance Cash

The teacher passes it over Cash in hand Madonna steps atop
a pedestal She winks at a bashful male student who blushes

MADONNA (CONTD)
Better make me look good kid

As her robe drops PRE-LAP a funky bass and vocals

INT SPIN RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

-Where Jellybean mans the mixing board for a FUNK BAND
Suddenly the session is interrupted by a loud CLUNK as a bag
full of cash and even some coins lands on Jellybean

MADONNA
See you tomorrow for phase two

Madonna exits before Jellybean can even process what just
happened He stares at the strange bag and turns to watch
Madonna go thrown but impressed

FUNK BAND SINGER
Dayum who was that

Two voices rise on our soundtrack singing a familiar song
MADONNA DAN (PRE-LAP)

Borderline feels like Im going to
lose my mind

INT SIRE RECORDS - RECORDING STUDIOS - DAY

Madonna and Dan sing Borderline together in Sire’s deluxe
studio Jellybean mans the board with his engineer as Nick
spreads out on the couch next to Ed and Stephen

MADONNA DAN
You just keep on pushing my love
over the borderline -

Madonna stops abruptly signalling to CUT the track

MADONNA
John you’re right It’s not working
as a duet It’s a love song

Stephen and Ed exchange looks Uh-oh But Jellybean nods

JELLYBEAN
Dan she needs to sing it to you
not with you It’s about yearning

DAN
I mean I get it but-

JELLYBEAN
Let’s try a take with just Madonna

Dan takes off his headphones angrily Madonna turns to him
and mouths “the rules” Dan begrudgingly tries to relax

DAN
(faux calm)
Sure No problem

Madonna shoots Jellybean a smile - it’s all good Jellybean
starts the backing track up again counting her in Dan
grumbles his way back into the control room slumping next to
his bandmates who give him “be cool” looks

JELLYBEAN
Okay I’m gonna punch up the bass a
little more and let’s go from the
top of the chorus

The track starts up again Madonna really starts to feel the
music The room’s energy changes as she starts to perform

MADONNA
Borderline feels like Im going to
lose my mind

She sings it with intensity directing the lyrics at Dan But
the way she sings it we’re not sure if it’s a love song

MADONNA (CONTD)
You just keep on pushing my love
over the borderline

Nick sits up This this he can sell

NICK
What did you do How did you do
that And why the fuck didn’t it
sound like that before

Jellybean just smiles A magician never reveals his secrets
Madonna comes out of the booth sweating excited

MADONNA
Play it back

JELLYBEAN
Hold on
(adjusting)
The levels are moveable but this
is the sound I want for the album

CLICK - the tape rolls and instantly we notice Madonna’s
energy is finally matched by the music - the song is
transformed It’s the beginning of the Madonna we know

Madonna closes her eyes and listens intensely tapping along
to the beat

MADONNA
Okay Good I’m gonna go again and-

NICK
I don’t know maybe let’s not mess
with success That was stellar

MADONNA
It’s better but I can make the
next take POP Let’s GO

Madonna jumps back in the booth The rest of the guys get up
and stretch preparing themselves for a long night

STEPHEN
(to Nick)
If you have anywhere to be better
cancel it now

DAN
Let’s get grub before we’re up

NICK
Are you sure you should leave

DAN
She won’t even notice

In the booth we see Madonna is laser focused on the goal
ahead of her She cues Jellybean

MADONNA
From the top

A lonely electric piano intro rings out the familiar opening
of Borderline The drums and bass kick in As it plays
Jellybean turns to a whiteboard where he’s listed every track
of the album He crosses off Borderline

MATCH CUT TO

INT SIRE RECORDS - RECORDING STUDIOS HALLWAY

We’re on the same whiteboard But now nearly every song is
crossed out except for Lucky Star

We pull back to where Dan and Stephen sit nearby They watch
as Madonna and Jellybean work at the mixing board together on
the new version of Lucky Star Dan anxious pulls Stephen

out into the hall They look like they’ve been there for days

DAN
Should we be worried man

STEPHEN
Why This sounds great

DAN
But everything’s different She
wont listen to anyone but him

Stephen can tell this isn’t just about the album

STEPHEN
She’s got tunnel vision Don’t let
it mean more than it means

DAN
You don’t feel like we’re being
replaced He cut all my vocals

Dan’s unraveling Stephen weighs what he’s about to say

STEPHEN
Look man this might be hard to
admit but she has always been more

ambitious than us
(MORE )

STEPHEN (CONTD)
She’s had plans to go all the way
since our Detroit days With or
without us

Dan won’t no can’t accept that

STEPHEN (CONTD)
She loves you but everything will
be easier if you accept that

He gives Stephen a look and brusquely pushes past him

STEPHEN (CONTD)
Dude where you going

DAN
I’ve got to take care of something

EXT NYC STREETS - PAYPHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

Dan sticks a quarter into the PAYPHONE dials Nervous but
clearly feeling like he’s been left no choice

DAN
(into phone)
Camille Hey it’s Dan

INT SIRE RECORDS - RECORDING STUDIO - NEXT NIGHT

Jellybean finishes playing back the completed Lucky Star for
the band They turn to Madonna for her reaction It’s silent

JELLYBEAN
It’s good right

MADONNA
No

The guys groan in defeat then

MADONNA (CONTD)
It’s fucking EPIC

The room takes a collective exhale Dan pulls Madonna onto
his lap for a big celebratory kiss

DAN
See babe it all worked out Just
like I said it would Time to
fuckin’ celebrate

The guys cheer grabbing their jackets Grateful to finally
enjoy themselves Dan gives Madonna another tight squeeze
marking his territory Jellybean pretends not to notice

ED
Finally

Madonna wiggles off Dan’s lap and touches Jellybean’s
shoulder A connection between the two

MADONNA
(distracted)
I’ll catch up with you guys later
I still wanna comb over the tracks
before we play it for Seymour
Everything-

DAN
Needs to be perfect I know It is
There’s nothing else you can do to
it Come on babe let’s get
something to eat Just me and you

Dan looks at her with those puppy dog eyes desperate

JELLYBEAN
(to Madonna)
It’s fine get out of here I’ve
got it

Madonna torn hesitates Then

MADONNA
I’m just gonna finish up You go
with the guys I’1ll see you at
home okay

She tries to sell it with a smile but Dan turns cold

DAN
Your loss

Dan clocks Madonna and Jellybean alone together Stephen
gives him a look - see As the guys leave we PRE-LAP the
tinny strains of an electric keyboard

EXT RECORDING STUDIO - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
--Where it’s coming from a PORTABLE KEYBOARD Jellybean’s

playing an early version of what we’ll come to know as
Sidewalk Talk Madonna huddled into Jellybean for warmth

JELLYBEAN
(air drumming to beat)
Watch where you walk cause the
sidewalks talks

He shyly looks to Madonna nervous for her reaction But she
hits him HARD

MADONNA
Don’t stop I love it It’s got
this amazing Afro-Cuban flavor

JELLYBEAN
Maybe it could be your next single

MADONNA
Totally I’m not really feeling
your first verse or the hook but-
(Jellybean laughs)
What

JELLYBEAN
You’ve got an opinion on
everything

Madonna’s excitement turns to frustration

MADONNA
(sarcastic)
Yeah but with no training to back
it up right What do I know huh

JELLYBEAN
I didn’t mean-

MADONNA
When I walk into Sire I know It’s
a boys club No one takes me
seriously Anytime I say something
they immediately right me off as a
bitch or difficult to work with

JELLYBEAN
Look I get it Whenever I meet
people they expect me to play Tito
Puente or Menudo or whatever
‘Cause I’m the Latin DJ right

She laughs letting her guard down a little Connecting

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
After this album everyone is going
to take you seriously They’1l have
to

(MORE )

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
You’ve got sharp instincts all I’m
saying School or no school Dick
or no dick

MADONNA
I wish Dan got it like you do He
just thinks I’m paranoid

Madonna squeeze his hand Jellybean is not sure how to read
the situation He lights up a cigarette

JELLYBEAN
You and Dan okay

MADONNA
YeaNo I don’t know

Madonna tries to find the words to explain herself

MADONNA (CONTD)

This might sound crazy but when I
first got to New York I wanted to
believe the best in everyone Ima
girl from the suburbs ya know

Jellybean listens Madonna’s voice changes struggling

MADONNA (CONTD)

Of course it wasn’t too long
before someone took advantage of
that Took advantage of me

Madonna looks away She feels guilty and ashamed Jellybean
looks at her slowly grasping what she might mean

JELLYBEAN
Wait Do you mean-

MADONNA
I don’t want to get into it I just
keep my guard up now There’s so
few people I really trust I just
don’t know if I’m pushing Dan away
or we’re just growing apart

Jellybean listens wanting to make her feel better but not
sure how

MADONNA (CONTD)

He won’t admit it but I think Dan
never expected me to keep playing
in his band Probably thought it
would be a hobby while I figured
out my shit

Jellybean tries to lighten the mood

JELLYBEAN
Something tells me you were going
to make music one way or another
with or without Dan With a name
like Madonna I mean come on What
choice did you have

She laughs in an honest playful way we haven’t heard before

MADONNA
I always knew I was either going to
be a nun or a star Spending six
months in a convent cured me of
that first one

JELLYBEAN
How do you know you didn’t make the
wrong choice Give up too soon

They hold each other’s gaze A charged moment between them
What now Then

Madonna grabs the keyboard playfully from Jellybean’s lap

MADONNA
I’1l show you

She starts playing something new and catchy Then the
batteries die

JELLYBEAN
Not a good sign

Madonna jumps up and kicks down the fire escape stairs

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
That’s just for emergencies

MADONNA
This is one
(off his look)
Batteries And pizza I’m
goddamned starving

Madonna climbs down leaving him nervous with his growing
feelings He follows her despite his better instincts

EXT PIZZA JOINT STREET - NIGHT

We see a giant hot slice of CHEESE PIZZA dripping into the
cardboard box as Madonna takes a huge bite Jellybean’s about
to sit down when Madonna grabs him

MADONNA
Come on I’ll teach you to walk
talk and eat pizza all at the same
time Old Italian trick There’s
gotta be another drug store we can
try a couple more blocks down

She goes to take another bite spilling pizza sauce and
grease all over herself

MADONNA (CONTD)
Shit

JELLYBEAN
Still mastering it I see

He helps wipe the tomato sauce off but her shirt is stained
Jellybean and Madonna catch themselves in another tense
moment He tries to keep it light

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
So you’re Italian I thought
Madonna was just a stage name

Madonna’s energy suddenly changes less playful

MADONNA
It was my mother’s name as well

Jellybean notices tries to keep it upbeat

JELLYBEAN
She must be proud of you
debuting an album for the big wigs
at Sire in a couple days

MADONNA

(matter of fact)
Id like to think my Mom would be
proud but she died when I was six
My dad he hasn’t cared about
anyone else since then So I’m not
really seeking anyone’s approval
but my own

JELLYBEAN
Oh I’m sorry I I didn’t know-

MADONNA
Don’t be That’s the past

Madonna spots a 24 HOUR DRUGSTORE across the street

MADONNA (CONTD)
I’1l be right back wait here

She chucks the rest of her soda and disappears into the 24HR
Drugstore Jellybean stands outside with his pizza He feels
like an idiot He can’t wait tosses it goes in after her

INT 24HR DRUGSTORE - AISLES - CONTINUOUS

Jellybean finds Madonna by a rack of touristy T-shirts She
changes out of her stained shirt into one Jellybean catches
a glimpse of her petite body but quickly looks away

She rolls up the sleeves and rips the neck line to hang off
her shoulder Jellybean can only smirk He still can’t
believe this chick

He watches as she heads down the aisle stashing a toothbrush
and some toothpaste in her backpack And oh yeah moves to
grab some batteries in the next aisle over

JELLYBEAN
Hey hey I can spot you

She slides the batteries into Jellybean’s jacket pocket

MADONNA
Where’s the fun in that

As soon as she moves on Jellybean puts the batteries back on
the shelf

JELLYBEAN
(to himself)
Shit

He grabs the batteries and tucks them in his jacket He
lingers back nervous about being caught Madonna studies the
faces on the hair-dye boxes They’re so tragically 80s

MADONNA
Boring Horrendous Creepy

She picks up a bottle of hair spray and sprays it on her
hair crunching it into a chic mess Then she spots the holy
grail - BRIGHT BLONDE BLEACH

MADONNA (CONTD)
Bingo

Madonna studies the box when a VOICE catches her off guard

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
You know you have to pay for that
before you use it

MADONNA
It was already ope-
(reacting)
-Camille

CAMILLE BARBONE (40s) stands authoritatively in her pink
power suit Madonna shrinks in her presence

MADONNA (CONT’D)
How are you

CAMILLE
Great as always Just finished
seeing a new act
(beat)
You look the same A tourist at
heart Still using your favorite
five finger discount

Camille touches Madonna’s hair Madonna freezes Camille puts
the bottle back on the shelf

CAMILLE (CONTD)
Going blonde is too risky

Madonna grabs the bottle back

MADONNA
I take more risks now

Jellybean afraid Madonna’s been caught rushes over to her

JELLYBEAN
Everything all right

Camille turns her attention to Jellybean

CAMILLE
Well you’re John Benitez
(to Madonna)
You two working together now
That’s a big score for you

Madonna looks down at the ground caught in an uncomfortable
situation Jellybean looks to Madonna for context confused

JELLYBEAN
And you are

Camille hands him her card

CAMILLE
Madonna’s still working on her
manners I see Camille Barbone
Gotham Records Madonna’s manager-

MADONNA
Ex-Manager Let’s go

Camille places her hands on Madonna’s shoulder delicately
brushing her hair Madonna visibly flinches at her touch

CAMILLE
Dan said things were tense By the
looks of it you’re not doing so
well either I’m just glad I could
help him with a couple of meetings

JELLYBEAN
What meetings

CAMILE
Totally as a precaution I’m sure
things will work out on the album
He’s just hedging his bets

Madonna’s face goes white betrayed

CAMILE (CONTD)

Don’t act so surprised Of course
he came to me Think of all our
history darling I saved you from
that Paris contract or did you
forget that too

(to Jellybean)
You should have seen her when I
found her A Michigan girl lost in
the big city If it wasn’t for me
shed probably have gone back home-

Madonna finally snaps Gets in Camilles face

MADONNA
You were the one who clung to me
Taking credit for everything
Trying to box me into your shitty
girl bands Well guess what I’m
conquering the fucking world and
you’ve got NOTHING to do with it

Madonna pushes past Camille with Jellybean in hand rushing
out the door knocking over a display of SUN-IN

MADONNA (CONTD)
I’m gonna be fuckin’ transcendent

ALARMS go off signaling a RENT-A-COP’s attention As he
chases after them they book it

EXT STREET ALLEY WAY - NIGHT

---Sprinting off then darting down an alleyway Madonna and
Jellybean crouch behind a dumpster as the Rent-A-Cop passes

MADONNA
Shit Feel my heart It’s racing

She grabs Jellybean’s hand and places it on her chest He
lingers for a moment then snaps out of it He pulls away

JELLYBEAN
Anything you want to tell me

Her energy shifts her tone sharp and defensive

MADONNA
What I didn’t know about Dan-

JELLYBEAN
Well get to Dan First you tell me
you’re a college drop out a
dancer but was that before or
after singing in Paris and playing
in girl-bands for Gotham I mean
how many deals do you have floating
around out there

MADONNA
You taking notes or something

JELLYBEAN
I’m just trying to protect myself
Our work I can’t do that if you
aren’t honest with me I won’t be -

Madonna grabs him and KISSES HIM Jellybean is stunned but
Madonna is in the moment holding him tight he pulls away

JELLYBEAN (CONT’D)
Madonna

Madonna stands up embarrassed Rejected

MADONNA
Right This was a mistake

Madonna spots A TAXI nearby She makes a run for it hiding
she’s hurt Jellybean confused lingers in the alleyway

JELLYBEAN
What are you doing

She shoots him a mischievous smile covering as she opens
the cab door

MADONNA
Making sure no one mistakes me for
that shy Michigan girl ever again

And we PRE-LAP Burning Up over

INT ERIKA’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

A trail of clothes safety-pins and HAIR-DYE bottles litter
the bathroom floor Madonna’s silhouette is obscured in the
foggy mirror The sink is stained with dye Her HAND
aggressively wipes away at the mirror revealing Madonnas
hair wrapped in a towel

ERIKA (0S)
Come on M Let’s have a look

With a deep exhale she reaches to unravel the towel

EXT NYC STREETS - EARLY SPRING - DAY

We trudge through the sludge of freshly melted snow with
determination on the heels of familiar combat boots black
torn leggings and a leather jacket

Crawling all the way up to reveal the most WILD PEROXIDE
BLONDE HAIR you’ve ever seen and Madonna’s steel-cool face

Transformed into a POP-STAR WE RECOGNIZE adorned in vintage
jewels and fierce confidence we move with her through the
big glass doors of Sire Records

INT SIRE RECORDS - BOARD ROOM - DAY
The meeting already deep in session Nick and the executive

team finish listening to Burning Up Jellybean and the band
are met with praise all around

NICK
This is gold JB I can smell the

I’m producing the next album

Dan shoots a look to Ed and Stephen What the fuck

NICK
That’s music to my ears You know
John I’d love to get you with more
artists on our roster as soon as
possible We love this sound

JELLYBEAN
That would be great I already have
some ideas-

But the whole room turns to see the newly blonde bombshell in
front of them Transformed it takes them all a second to
even realize it’s Madonna

DAN
You’re late

MADONNA
The music speaks for itself

Madonna slides into the seat at the head of the table
Jellybean and Madonna share a look He’s got a million
questions

JELLYBEAN
I like your hair

--But he knows better than to ask
NICK
Madonna I was just telling the
band that the album is amazing
EXEC 1
Dan Shine A Light is so catchy
It’s perfect for the first single

Dan sits up with praise as more EXECS chime-in in agreement

NICK
(to Madonna)
John’s informed us that he’s
producing the next album That
true Cause he’s the type of
producer Seymour can get behind

Madonna looks to her partner dropping her poker face with a
telling smile Dan catches the exchange

DAN
I think that’s a discussion for
another time-

MADONNA

No I wouldn’t have it any other
way Seymour likes it I like it

Dan’s about to lose his shit
NICK
Great It’s settled After the

paperwork closes we can talk about
next steps

EXEC 2
Have you finalized the album name

Dan goes to speak up but Madonna cuts him off again

MADONNA
Madonna

Dan Ed and Stephen exchange uncomfortable looks

STEPHEN
Sounds a little Catholic M

DAN
And that makes it sound like you’re
a solo artist

JELLYBEAN
I think it’s clean Marketable

DAN
I didn’t ask your opinion

Nick tries to defuse the tension

NICK
Well I think it’s simple Edgy -

DAN
Excuse me She can’t just rename
the fucking album We’re a band

MADONNA
Should I have called Camille and
checked with her first I didn’t
think you would care since you’re
taking meetings all over town

Dan is stunned Ed slides down in his seat Stephen looks at
them just as pissed as Madonna Not cool guys

MADONNA (CONTD)
And it’s in the contract so I
kinda can

Madonna slides him their contract He flips through scared

DAN
(to the execs pleading)
I wrote two of the singles you’re
all raving about and you’re
telling me I can’t name my album
for the band I started

Dan looks to Nick for help Nothing Dan storms out with Ed
No one sure what to do Madonna doesn’t bat an eye

MADONNA
They’1l get over it
STEPHEN
Shit Name or no name I just wanna

get paid
Nick and the other Execs laugh awkwardly

MADONNA
Well let’s lock it up Where’s
Seymour

The Execs look to Nick to deliver the news

NICK
Seymour is recovering in the
hospital from open heart surgery
Nothing major

MADONNA
And

NICK
Well we can’t move forward ‘til
Seymour signs off What do you
wanna do
(jokingly)
Negotiate in the hospital

And with that

INT HOSPITAL - SEYMOUR STEIN’S HOSPITAL ROOM

We hear the end of Burning Up over small speakers Madonna
stands in front of SEYMOUR STEIN who lays in his hospital
gown finishing his obligatory hospital Jello

SEYMOUR STEIN
You know you’ve got some nerve
coming down here

Jellybean and Nick stand in the doorway Nick looks anxious
like he’s standing in front of the great and powerful OZ

NICK
Seymour I told her-

MADONNA
And you’ve got balls making me wait
another minute to release my album
when I can take it to EMI or any
other competitor considering your
weakened condition

Seymour and Madonna hold a tense look Seymour laughs

SEYMOUR STEIN
Weakened condition Well I’1l1 be
damned

Nick awkwardly laughs too

SEYMOUR STEIN (CONT’D)
(to Madonna)
You’re lucky you have a good sound
to back up your crazy kiddo That
Benitez is the real thing

MADONNA

Madonna sits down on the side of his bed

and paperwork

Just then Ed and Dan enter Ed hovers by the door as Dan
scans the room for Madonna

STEPHEN

MADONNA
I knew he’d come to his senses

Madonna climbs out of the booth and runs over to Dan as SHINE

left to discuss We’re through

MADONNA

MADONNA
Those songs were weak I was going
to suggest we cut them anyway and
Ill write a new single to replace
Shine a Light I can produce-

NICK
You can’t produce shit You don’t

songs What do you expect me to go

No that he has the hottest solo
act in town

Madonna rises to leave but Nick gets in her face

NICK
Look you little twat you fuck this

Madonna doesn’t take threats lightly she leans over the desk
and pulls on Nick’s lapels hard Nick is genuinely scared

She removes the ice pack He winces in pain

DEBBIE (CONTD)
Was she worth it

JELLYBEAN
What are you talking about

DEBBIE
You only get a black eye over a
girl or money and you aren’t a
gambling man

JELLYBEAN
I was sucker punched by a coke
head
Jellybean checks the answering machine No messages
DEBBIE
Youve checked that thing ten times
today You waiting on life or death

Jellybean ignores her till KNOCK KNOCK
Jellybean groans goes to the door to find Madonna standing
in the doorway

they’re selling

MADONNA
Hey

Off Madonna’s pleading face

INT JELLYBEANS APT - BEDROOM

Jellybean fumbles through paperwork Madonna waits anxiously

JELLYBEAN
He’s right - Dan owns his songs
outright Camille screwed you

Madonna paces the room like a cornered animal

MADONNA
FUCK Maybe I deserve this I don’t
know what I was thinking there’s
no way can I write a song in a week

Madonna throws her bag across the room fighting back tears
hyperventilating Jellybean has never seen her so fragile

JELLYBEAN
Hey calm down You’re not on your
own You have me in your corner

She’s not processing what he’s saying drowning in panic

MADONNA
I didn’t think Dan was cruel enough
to do this Sire’s never giving me
another shot after this If you
want to cut your losses now I
wouldn’t blame you I’m just
dragging you down

He grabs her A charged moment

JELLYBEAN
You aren’t dragging me down Look
at me do you trust me

Madonna’s now holding Jellybean’s intense gaze

MADONNA
I want to

JELLYBEAN
Trust me when I say I’m in your
corner I think you’re the most
driven smart and talented artist
I’ve worked with in a long time
Youve got vision and grit

Madonna laughs

MADONNA
Really Grit

JELLYBEAN
Sure you drive me crazy get me
into bar fights and almost

arrested -
MADONNA
Thanks
He goes for it
JELLYBEAN

But despite all my rules I’m
tired of pretending that I wasn’t
waiting for you to call or that I
don’t think about you constantly
or that our kiss was a
mistakebecause it wasn’t

Silence Did he fuck it all up She touches his face sweetly
studying him

MADONNA
It’s okay

JELLYBEAN
It is

MADONNA

Yeah I never liked following your
rules anyway

Jellybean pulls Madonna in for a KISS falling onto the bed

INT JELLYBEANS APT - BEDROOM - LATER

INT BRONX YMCA - INDOOR POOL - DAY

We see a flyer on a door leading to the indoor swimming pool
It reads SONGWRITER AUDITIONS

A rotating door of MEDIOCRE TO BAD MUSICIANS perform by the
pool for Madonna and Jellybean Reggae Ska Blues Pop RandB -
all wrong for Madonna

Madonna listens intently behind her sunglasses cutting each
song one by one ‘til she can’t take it anymore

MADONNA
These are all terrible None of
these match the vibe of the album

She tosses the song sheets into the pool Jellybean folds
over into his arms on the table He’s just as frustrated

JELLYBEAN
My cousin said we could stay ‘til
closing so let’s just power
through a couple more

MADONNA

Through the double doors PURE ENERGY a black disco band
comprised of vocalist LISA STEVENS and Bassist RICHARD
CURTIS set up to play

JELLYBEAN

any of your original stuff

RICHARD
Our label isn’t budging on
releasing this song so maybe it
can find a home with you at Sire

Richard and Lisa set up their keys and bass

LISA
(to Richard)
The girl’s white

RICHARD
(to Lisa)
If Jellybean’s excited about her

the cover of Billboard okay

Madonna’s frustrated with their whispering

MADONNA
Is there a problem

RICHARD

LISA
We’re in a pool for starters

MADONNA
Yeah good acoustics

Richard shoots Lisa a look - shut up and play

LISA
The song is about love and unity

Lisa starts the piano riff followed by Richard’s smooth bass
line a riff we soon recognize as

LISA (CONTD)
Holiday Celebrate
Holiday Celebrate

Madonna lowers her sunglasses for the first time Jellybean
sits up Could this be their song

MADONNA
Stop

Everyone comes to a standstill

MADONNA (CONTD)
That bass riff can we cut it It’s
running against the melody

Richard and Lisa share the look of surprise with Jellybean
No one questions their riffs especially not a no-name singer
for hire Tensions are tight until

RICHARD
(laughing)
Honey I appreciate your note but
trust me you’re gonna want to keep
the riff It’s driving like you

And the bass riff drives us forward in a race against time

hit this high C

already

MADONNA
No that’s stupid It’s ready
(she catches herself)
Sorry I’ve just got a splitting
headache

Madonna rests her head on his lap Jellybean feels torn He
shouldn’t talk about business but he can’t help himself

me or Sidewalk Talk

MADONNA
What do you mean I did
JELLYBEAN
No not really You just said you

MADONNA
Yeah so I’ve got a lot going on

Madonna gets up for a water bottle He’s not used to
her like this Not with him He’s starting to boil

JELLYBEAN
You know I don’t care about
publicity when it comes to me but
it feels like you’re avoiding
mentioning our single completely
That’s bad for the music our plans-

MADONNA
Well the label hasn’t really
signed off on the song So why
advertise what I can’t sell

Jellybean is thrown

JELLYBEAN
What are you talking about We made
a deal that I was producing your
next album Nick knows that
Seymour knows that And since when
do you ever wait for permission to
do anything

MADONNA
I just want to do what’s best for
the album Calm the fuck down

JELLYBEAN

producer It’s my name on the line

real adult John Mr Big Producer

at me-

JELLYBEAN
Only you care about the attention
I CARE ABOUT THE FUCKING MUSIC

He exits

Madonna alone and furious tries to collect herself She
sits down at the vanity and takes a deep rage filled breath

Then STINGING PAIN - Madonna clenches her stomach She
leans against the wall suddenly very dizzy She reaches for
a waste basket and VOMITS She sits back up trying to settle
her stomach Freaked out What the fuck is going on

NICK (PRE-LAP)
Shit happens she’s a star now

INT RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

As Jellybean opens the door and walks in he catches Madonna
motioning for Erika to shut it off immediately

MADONNA
You’re home early babe

JELLYBEAN

Jellybean can feel the weird tension He sits on the couch
next to Erika tired and suspicious

breath and gathers herself She doesn’t want to fight

dancing white leather couches and shag rugs We move
through the billows of cigarette smoke into the crowd
picking up bits of conversations between famous party guests

We pass ANDY WARHOL in a full Mink Coat talking to BASQUIAT

BASQUIAT
When I’m mad at a woman I’m driven
to paint her rather than argue

WARHOL
Aw the fantasy love is always
better than the reality of love

Jellybean and Erika stand at the doorway taking in the party
Madonna of course is unimpressed

JELLYBEAN
Shit

MADONNA

Madonna charges into the glamorous mayhem

INT WARHOL’S FACTORY PARTY - NIGHT

Madonna Jellybean and Erika bounce around the party We see
Madonna throughout the night secretly pouring out her drinks
into planters or switching it with water

suddenly stop listening to your
music if you don’t drink

Madonna just gives him a look - You don’t get it

INT WARHOL’S FACTORY PARTY - DANCE FLOOR - LATER

We see Madonna and Jellybean dancing laughing actually

Madonna and Jellybean turn from their loving embrace on the
dance floor Madonna’s attention shifts to Prince intrigued

MADONNA
Hot But drunk

You kinda know him through that
Chic guy right

JELLYBEAN
(suspiciously)
Who Nile Rodgers Why would she
know him

ERIKA

Madonna stops her before she drunkenly blurts out her secret

MADONNA
(to Jellybean)
Whose assistant threw away my tape
Unlike you babe She’s drunk

She plants a kiss on him distracting him Things are good

Madonna grabs Erika pulling weirdly hard Jellybean thinks
nothing of it From the dance floor Madonna plots her exit

The party still in full swing Jellybean emerges from the
bathroom looking for Madonna on the dance floor when

He finds Madonna and Erika sitting with Prince and his
entourage He does a double take He walks over to her when
he’s suddenly stopped by Prince’s BODYGUARD

JELLYBEAN
It’s cool that’s my girlfriend

The Bodyguard isn’t having it

BODYGUARD
You need to step back

JELLYBEAN

Madonna

He tries to move past the bodyguard Madonna fully engrossed
in a conversation with Prince doesn’t see him Or does she

The Bodyguard steps aside letting Jellybean through

grooves along to it but his enthusiasm is not met by Nick or
the other execs in the room Madonna keeps on a poker face
holding her cards close to the chest The music stops

SEYMOUR STEIN
I don’t get it

JELLYBEAN
It’s about secrets and-

SEYMOUR STEIN
No I know what the song’s about
This sounds completely different
from her last album

JELLYBEAN
It’s an evolution As an artist-

SEYMOUR STEIN
No kid she’s a brand A new brand
You don’t change the brand just as
people are starting to love it

NICK
This single is just too urban
John People are going to turn on
the radio and not know it’s her

Jellybean turns to Madonna for backup
JELLYBEAN

Madonna tell them what we talked
about

Madonna takes a deep breath

MADONNA
I agree with Seymour I like the
song but maybe you release it
under your own name as an artist

NICK
That’s not a bad idea actually

Jellybean scrambles to save face

JELLYBEAN
Sure That’s an idea But we’ve got
more tracks this doesn’t have to
be the single we lead with for her

Madonna looks to Nick

NICK
Right we’ve got another single in
contention from Nile Rodgers

SEYMOUR STEIN
Great well let’s hear it

Jellybean turns to Madonna What She looks away

EXT SIRE RECORDS OFFICES - STREET - DAY - LATER

Madonna follows close behind very aware they’re in public

JELLYBEAN
LIKE A VIRGIN And you said you
didn’t know Nile Now he’s fucking
producing your whole album

MADONNA
It’s the song I wanted and Nile
agreed I should do it I gave you
the first option to produce it You
just didn’t listen to me

JELLYBEAN
No you don’t get to make yourself
the victim You fucking lied to me
Lied to my face for weeks

MADONNA
Can we please go somewhere else and
talk about this

JELLYBEAN
I was sitting in there wondering
why you didn’t have my back but
it’s because you already stabbed me
in it

MADONNA
You can’t really think it’s my
fault Sire didn’t like your
direction for my album

Jellybean doesn’t respond He does blame her Madonna starts
to walk away but she has more to say

MADONNA (CONTD)

You know no one listened to me the
first time around I wasn’t going
to let that happen again You
weren’t taking my ideas so I had a
contingency plan That’s just smart
business John One flop and I’m
done There’s no second chances for
an artist like me Not for a woman-

JELLYBEAN
Not everyone is out to get you
Just admit you wanted a bigger name
and that you’re you’re a
manipulative bitch

Madonna SLAPS him Tears in her eyes she turns to leave and
maybe for good She refuses to let him see her cry

MADONNA
Fuck you I don’t need this shit
Not from you

He just stands there Angry at her but angrier at himself
He punches a wall and immediately regrets it
EXT STREET ALLEY WAY - CONTINUOUS

Madonna turns the corner Out of sight she shakes with anger

But then she starts to lose her balance her head throbbing
As she holds onto the wall for life she VOMITS

(off Jellybean’s hand)
Woman troubles

JELLYBEAN
I don’t really feel comfortable
talking about her with you Sorry

DAN
Sure sure

Dan takes a drag of his cigarette

DAN (CONTD)
But let me guess Something about
being promised producer credit but
suddenly she’s distant and then
she’s replaced you with a bigger
name Something like that

Jellybean can’t believe what he’s hearing

JELLYBEAN
You psychic

DAN
No I just read the trades
(beat)
And the fact that she did the same
thing to me

They stand quiet Jellybean doesn’t know what to say

JELLYBEAN
I didn’t know that man I thought
she talked to you and the whole
band before I came on board

DAN
Does that sound like her

It’s quiet again They both wait for the other to speak

JELLYBEAN
How’d you deal with it

DAN
It was hard Getting clean helped
but once I really accepted
Madonna’s number one cause is
Madonna I took it less personal

Jellybean’s done with the conversation What was he thinking

JELLYBEAN
Well I gotta get going

DAN
Listen man No matter how much she
says she’s never loved anyone like
she’s loved you she always loves
herself more She’s a survivor
99

JELLYBEAN
I think I’m smart enough to know
when someone is using me What we
had was real

Dan clocks the past-tense He heads back into the bar then -

DAN

You know what her power is John
She makes you want to be used by
her She sucks you into her world
and takes you along for a ride but
by the time you realize you were
even on her crazy train she’s
already kicked you off

(beat)
It’s not a matter of if you get off
man it just a matter of when

JELLYBEAN
So when did you get off

DAN
When you got on

Silence Madonna still lost in thought
Jellybean starts throwing himself against the door Harder
and harder till HE BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR where he finds
Madonna on the floor in a trance The color drained from her

face He kneels down to her Gentle

surprised after what we talked
about

MADONNA
Well everything happens for a
reason If my career has to take a
break then maybe it’s a sign

ERIKA

director for your single

Jellybean makes a face
JELLYBEAN

I’m not going to do any videos MTV

MADONNA
That’s ridiculous MTV is the
future

JELLYBEAN

I resent the fact that kids grew up
listening to the radio dreaming
about playing music and now they
have to be an actor too Pass

MADONNA
When you’re up on stage that’s a
performance right So if someone
puts a camera on you what’s the
difference

JELLYBEAN
I’m musician My fans will find it
on their own the way all great
music was discovered before MTV

MADONNA
Oh so because I’m on MTV I’m not
a real musician

JELLYBEAN
That’s not what I’m saying We just
make different stuff babe It’s
like comparing apples to oranges

MADONNA
Uh huh

She speeds up pissed but he pulls her back lovingly

JELLYBEAN
I’m sorry I’m just proud of my
music You were right about doing
my own album Can’t I pretend to
have a little control over how it’s
released

She smiles She shakes her head ‘no’ playfully

I thought this meeting was about my
own album

The smaller executives share a look

NICK
Look we’re going to have to table
it Just for now It’s confusing
your brand with our other artists
They want to work with the guy
behind Madonna

JELLYBEAN
Nick I’m not just the guy behind
Madonna I have more sounds than
just Holiday and Lucky Star

SEYMOUR STEIN
John we appreciated what you’ve
done for Madonna and we have other
artists on our roster we’d love you
work to with but-—

JELLYBEAN
But my own music isn’t as good as
that Holiday crap

and

SEYMOUR STEIN
Look kid Holiday is what put you
in that seat you’re in so Id
watch your tone

NICK
John I think youre missing the
point We want to keep working with
you despite tabling the release of
What-Up-Son

JELLYBEAN
(defensive)
It’s WOTUPSKI

Nick slides a folder down to Jellybean

SEYMOUR STEIN
John you have a gift for
collaborating with other artists
They trust you

NICK
Take a look at the people lining up
to work with you Whitney Houston

get in the way of good money

Madonna pulls him inside Jellybean stifles back tears

MADONNA
John-

JELLYBEAN

MADONNA (CONTD)
What’s going on John

JELLYBEAN

need Sire or MTV dictating our art
I’1l go to all the clubs sling my
own stuff My name means something
to real musicians I know it does

Madonna doesn’t know what to say

I’m sorry I should have waited
‘til after the VMA’s but I just
want to start our lives together

everything better You trust me

inside We MOVE IN ON her leather jacket and all those
signatures Camille Dan Jellybean

Madonna guides Jellybean out of the room with a quick kiss
No time to acknowledge the fact that Cher is suddenly her new
friend Something feels weird but he shakes it off

As Jellybean walks through the gallows of backstage

BETTE MIDLER (PRE-LAP)
I’m thrilled to introduce a woman
whose name has been on everyone’s
lips for the last six months-

INT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - VMA STAGE - NIGHT
We see BETTE MIDLER on stage introducing the next act

BETTE MIDLER
A woman who pulled herself up by
her bra straps and who has been
known to let them down
occasionally

BEHIND THE CURTAINS Madonna braces herself atop of a GIANT
THREE TIER WEDDING CAKE next to a FAKE GROOM Deep breaths

MADONNA
If not now then when

Back on stage

BETTE MIDLER
She’s great she’s hot she’s a lot
like a virgin she’s MADONNA

The curtains pull back the lights drop Madonna stares out
the star-studded audience stares back at her In this moment
she know she’s finally arrived Like a Virgin starts to play

MADONNA
I made it through the wilderness
Somehow I made it through
Didnt know how lost I was
Until I found you

Jellybean and Erika sit behind the Sire executives and Nile
Rodgers in the audience All of them are simultaneously taken
aback by Madonna’s sheer star power Her presence

Madonna makes her way down the fake wedding cake and just as
she’s about to step off the last tier she trips on her veil

loses her footing a heel goes flying and FALLS Hard

Jellybean sits up in his seat expecting the worst All he
can think about is his baby The cameras lose her The
screens are filled with BLACK searching for her on stage

INT CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The DIRECTOR screams into the microphone as the camera team
scrambles to figure out what to do The monitors still black

DIRECTOR
This is live people Someone get
eyes on her Now Now Now

INT RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - VMA STAGE - CONTINUOUS

A flash of panic sets across Madonna’s face Frozen The
backing track still playing her vocals coming up in 321

She kicks off her other high heel and rolls with it
Literally She stays on the floor rolling around lifting up
her dress sensually THE AUDIENCE LOVES IT

The cameras finally find her and she plays to them perfectly
as if to a lover They follow her as she gyrates and humps
the stage rolling around like a kitten in heat

MADONNA
Like a virgin Feels so good inside
When you hold me And your heart
beats And you love me Oh oh whoa

Madonna smiles to roaring applause She really takes in the
moment The love the adoration She tosses her fears out
with her bouquet into the crowd It’s all her It’s all now

INT CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Everyone exhales The Director lights up a cigarette

DIRECTOR
I’m going to have the FCC all over
my ass tomorrow for that one

INT VMAS - BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Jellybean rushes his way over to Madonna’s dressing room
where he finds her alone for once She sits at the vanity

JELLYBEAN
We should get you to the hospital

MADONNA
No I’m okay

JELLYBEAN
You fell really hard on stage We
should take you to the ER make
sure the baby is okay

MADONNA
It’s fine Don’t worry about it
(off his look)
I took care of it already

JELLYBEAN
What do you mean you took care of
it

Madonna continues to apply lipstick in the mirror Coldly

MADONNA
I won’t have to choose between my

career and a family now
(MORE )

MADONNA (CONTD)
And that’s how I want it It was my
decision and mine alone

She slides him the ring box

MADONNA (CONTD)
I didn’t want to have to do this
here But you’ve forced my hand

The words echo like a bomb in Jellybean’s head He tries to
process The room spins Madonna moves to change

JELLYBEAN
Do you really need the whole world
to love you Was I never enough

MADONNA
(lying)
No You never were

JELLYBEAN
Why are you being like this This
isn’t you

MADONNA
No trying to be what you wanted a
mother a wife That wasn’t me You
just weren’t willing to accept it

Jellybean crumbles the wind knocked out of him

JELLYBEAN
You’re a leech a cut-throat
opportunistic hack-

MADONNA
Because I decided to take charge of
my career Tell me John tell me
who’s my example Who’s the female
version of me I should model myself
after How should I have behaved

JELLYBEAN
This is more than just about your
stupid career This was about us
our lives

MADONNA
That’s what I’ve been trying to
tell you My career is my life You
knew that deep down I was never
going to be a Ronette to your Phil

Spector
(MORE )
MADONNA (CONTD)
Because the truth is John you
were never okay with me outshining
you

JELLYBEAN
I MADE YOU

He swipes flower vases off the table It’s what she’s been
waiting to hear What she needed to hear

MADONNA
Michael Jackson Prince they make
albums and are declared geniuses I
come out and people assume I’m a
fucking puppet controlled by a
better more talented man Well
I’m not going to be anyone’s
mouthpiece

She leans in towards him making sure every word lands

MADONNA (CONTD)
Not Nile’s not Seymour’s not
yours I’m calling the shots And I
can’t wait for you to figure that
out anymore I’m too busy creating
a fucking lane

Madonna pushes past Jellybean throws open the door for him
to leave Now Masking her feelings behind hurtful words

MADONNA (CONTD)
Twenty years from now John the
only thing you’ll be remembered for
is being my ex

He stares at her More sad than angry
JELLYBEAN

And even with all your fans and

fame youll always be alone
INT VMAS - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
Jellybean walks out pushing through WELL-WISHERS and FANS
waiting for Madonna He moves through them around them past
them Finds the nearest exit he can getting out of there

INT VMAS - BACKSTAGE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Alone the door closed Madonna sits in front of her vanity
She exhales

Tries to fix her eye make up erase any sign of Jellybean of
her feelings Goes to drink a glass of water Her hands
suddenly shaking unable to drink Her breath quickens She
can’t hold it all back anymore Overwhelmed

She lets it all out Stops being Madonna the icon Allows
herself to cry to let her guard down her wall crumbling
The mask falls as the emotion spills out of her The pain
the sadness the constant pressure and anxiety If only for a
moment we see Madonna the person

And then there’s a KNOCK at the door
Madonna pulls herself back together puts back on her armor

MADONNA
WHAT

Her assistant SHERYL peers meekly in from the door

SHERYL
Nick and Seymour are waiting with
the car to take you to the after
party there’s some press But I
can tell them you aren’t doing any -

MADONNA
NO

SHERYL
Do you want me to stall

MADONNA
No

Madonna looks to the mirror one last time and stands
confidently as she moves to the door

MADONNA (CONTD)
I’m ready now

As she exits we hold on the back of her chair her leather
jacket hangs heavy with weight The signatures in memoriam to
Jellybean and all the rest of her past

But just as we think she’s gone HER HAND DARTS BACK INTO
FRAME reaching for what she knows She puts the jacket on
It’s a reminder she tells herself a reminder of where she’s
been and where she’s about to go

END
