Principato Young Ent 274-4180
OPEN ON

CLOSE ON an AMERICAN FLAG PATRIOTIC MUSIC swells We PULL
BACK to REVEAL BLACK SKY and STARS behind it BACK further
to REVEAL

It’s planted in the desolate grey dust of THE MOON

DRAMATIC VOICE OVER
In 1969 the United States of
America landed a man on the surface
of the Moon The historic feat was
a testament to the Human will and
all it dare accomplish The men and
women who made it possible were
brave bold and brilliant True
heroes every one of them

DISSOLVE TO

INT SPACE CAPSULE - DAY

An ASTRONAUT in a silver space suit and space helmet sits
curled up in this tiny cramped one man SPACE CAPSULE

The suit and chunky antique electronics speaks of vintage
NASA - RIGHT STUFF ERA

STATIC FILLED VOICE (RADIO)
Capsule to command I am five by
five green across the board and
ready to go

The astronaut flips up his helmet visor SMOKE wafts out and
we see

CAPTAIN BIFF GIMBLE (35-40) A gruff tough good ‘ol boy
who’s smoking a CIGARETTE inside his space-suit

BIFF GIMBLE
(southern drawl emerging)
So send my damn ass to space

INT NASA MISSION CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

GODDARD FLACK - short and nerdy - stands in the center
of MISSION CONTROL The nerd in charge he wears the
ENGINEER’S UNIFORM Short sleeve button down shirt black
tie and glasses He speaks into a large HEADSET MIC COMBO

The massive ROOM is full of clunky computer stations manned
by other nerdy ENGINEERS all dressed just like Goddard
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 2

GODDARD FLACK
(annoyed but placating)
Yes Biff we copy and we are
working on it

BIFF GIMBLE (0S - RADIO)
Well no rush Heck we can just sit
around and wait for them Ruusskies
to send up a few more guys

DON CHIPLEY
What’s the hold up Goddard

DON CHIPLEY has a crew cut so perfect you could use it
as a desk He’s NASA’S DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS The BIG BOSS

GODDARD FLACK
Don he’s sitting on sixty thousand
pounds of explosives I’d like to
double check a few things

BIFF GIMBLE (0S - RADIO)
Hey Biff Gimble explodes for
breakfast Now double-check down
‘yer pants for some balls and
let’s tear space a new A-Hole

Goddard takes a calming breath It sort of works
GODDARD FLACK
Excellent suggestions Biff we will
get right on it
(toggles a switch)
Hobart

CUT TO

EXT SKY - CONTINUOUS

We are some place high up Wind whips through the blue sky
Wizzzzz A MAN harnessed to a rope rappels down into frame
This is HOBART BEEMAN Along with the standard
engineer’s uniform and a hard hat Hobart wears EXTREMELY
THICK GLASSES He’s taller and more filled out than the

other engineers There’s a quiet strength within this man

GODDARD FLACK (0S - RADIO)
Hobart how we doing

Hobart grabs a large old-school walkie-talkie off his belt
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 3

HOBART BEEMAN
Just to be safe I’d like to take
her out for a quick spin

OUT TO REVEAL Hobart dangles off the side of

THE MERCURY-REDSTONE ROCKET - The first rocket NASA used to
send a man into space Hobart is a mere speck next to this
EIGHT STORY MISSILE Ready to go it quakes shudders and
steams from the sub-zero fuel inside

INTERCUT HOBART and GODDARD in MISSION CONTROL
GODDARD FLACK
You and me both But hey any
joker can take a ride in history
Engineers -
HOBART BEEMAN
(finishing their ritual)
Engineers build history

Hobart sighs and takes a longing look up at the rocket

HOBART BEEMAN (CONT’D)
OK buddy light her up

Whizzzzz Hobart drops down out of sight

INT MISSION CONTROL - CONTINUOUS
Again Biff’s grating voice sounds out over the Radio

BIFF GIMBLE (0S - RADIO)
Hey Goddard What gives You up
and quittin’ on me

A visible resolve comes over Goddard

GODDARD FLACK
I don’t quit Telemetry

LEWIS SKIPPLE - Innocent sheltered and terrified with
MASSIVE sweat stains - performs last minute SLIDE RULER
calculations like someone finishing a test after the
teacher’s called “pencil’s down”

LEWIS SKIPPLE
Umm Umm I thiiiiiink uhhhh -

GODDARD FLACK
Lewis
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 4

LEWIS SKIPPLE
Yes We’re good NO Wait Yes No
Yes GO We’re GO

GODDARD FLACK
Hans Propulsion

HANS VAN BERNER - A short wiry German with coke-bottle
glasses and a big nose screams back

HANS VAN BERNER (GERMAN ACCENT)
Ya Za Rocket’s Great Ve Love it
GO

GODDARD FLACK
Guidance

SY TINKERMAN - An odd emotionally challenged savant

SY TINKERMAN
(re his Console)
I’m looking at four hundred and
thirty three lights

GODDARD FLACK
Sy

SY TINKERMAN
Fifty two are blinking

GODDARD FLACK
sy

SY TINKERMAN
GO

GODDARD FLACK
We are go for countdown Ignition
in 1098

The room is silent Every Engineer is gripped with fear and
anticipation

GODDARD FLACK (CONTD)
ed ee ee a a
(quiet to himself)
Please don’t blow up
(loud to the room)
One Ignition

OUT ON THE LAUNCH PAD - With a roar an INFERNO ERUPTS out of
the rocket’s GIANT ENGINES Slowly it creeps into the air
(NOTE - When possible real old NASA footage will be
mixed in to give the feeling of faux-history)
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 5

BACK IN MISSION CONTROL - White knuckle tension Goddard
stares up at the MISSION CONTROL DISPLAY - huge screens
featuring flight data live launch video and a MAP OF THE
WORLD with a simplistic ANIMATED ROCKET floating across it

HANS VAN BERNER
LIFT OFF Ve have za’ LIFT OFF

INSIDE THE CAPSULE - Shaking violently Biff screams

BIFF GIMBLE
UP YOUR ASS GRAVITY

EXT LAUNCH OBSERVATION AREA —- CONTINUOUS

A group of SCIENTISTS run for the cover of concrete BLAST
BARRICADES Hobart following them stops and turns around

RANDOM SCIENTIST
Beeman come on

HOBART BEEMAN
One second

As Hobart watches the rocket climb into the heavens we see
both joy and longing in his face A culmination of a dream
and a slap in the face

HOBART BEEMAN (CONT’D)
(quiet to himself)
Some day That’1ll be me I’1l be
back up there

BOOM Hobart’s face is hit by smoke dust and pebbles from
the rocket’s blast wave His cheeks are smeared back against
his face The heartfelt moment is totally undercut

INT MISSION CONTROL - CONTINUOUS

Every Engineer is glued to a terminal monitoring his small
piece of the launch

GODDARD
(into mic)
Biff do you read Capsule this is
control do you copy

INTERCUT GODDARD in MISSION CONTROL and BIFF in his CAPSULE

BIFF
(shaking strained)
Copy control and WOW
(MORE )
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 6

BIFF (CONTD)
The power a’this thing It’s- It’s
like I’m riding on a giant fire
cracker that some even more giant
Mexican sold me OH Now the sky’s
turning black and I can see all of
Gods creation stretchin’ out below
me and it’s Well it’s Well I
am just ROCK HARD I have a
tremendous erection

Goddard looks at the FLIGHT SURGEON who reads a PAPER GRAPH
emerging from the computer in front of him

The Surgeon points to something on a graph and nods The
instruments confirm the boner Goddard rolls his eyes

BIFF (CONTD)
WAIT The rocket cut out It just
got real smooth and I’m weightless

UP IN SPACE - The TINY CAPSULE breaks away from the rocket’s
long tube and glides off into free-fall

BIFF (CONTD)
I’m WEIGHTLESS and I just CAME
I came in my suit It was a lot

Again the FLIGHT SURGEON checks the graph Again he nods

BIFF (CONTD)
Now this is magical I wish you
could be up here with me Honestly
I feel terrible that ya’ll’re
cowardly physically deficient
needle-dick poindexters who will
die without experiencing a single
second of this wonderful majesty

Silence fills Mission Control as all the Engineers feel
horrible about themselves

GODDARD
Thank you Biff that’s nice
(beat to the room)
Guys what I think Biff really
meant is CONGRATULATIONS We
just put America in the space race

Now Mission Control erupts in cheers It’s the best day ever
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 7

INT NEWSDESK - CONTINUOUS

EMMET KRAFT a pessimistic Cronkite-era news reporter sits
at a news desk with launch-footage playing behind him

EMMET KRAFT
And so on this May afternoon in
the year nineteen hundred and sixty
one America sends its first
citizen into space A journey whose
historic significance is only
overshadowed by its catastrophic
danger and folly And though by
now he’s probably nothing more
than a charred cinder afloat in
that silent icy void good luck to
you Astronaut Biff Gimble

EXT THE OCEAN - DAY

Biff’s CAPSULE parachute deployed splashes down

EXT TARMAC - LATER

FLASH BULBS POP as Biff in his silver space suit helmet
tucked under his arm steps out of a parked HELICOPTER

A throng of REPORTERS circle around to greet the hero
America’s first astronaut

REPORTER 1
Biff Tell us were you scared

BIFF
Well when you’re up there a
million miles from Earth -

REPORTER 1
Weren’t you only a hundred miles
from Earth

BIFF

DID I SEE YOU IN SPACE

(off reporter’s sorry

look)
Right OK So when you’re up there
with nothing but a tin can
protectin’ you it feels like
youre all alone but really

In the distance behind the reporters Goddard Hobart
Lewis Sy and Hans walk up and watch
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 8

GODDARD
Here it comes guys

HOBART
You think Biff is going to thank
us

GODDARD

I think everyone knows this was a
team effort

BIFF
You are You’re all alone

Goddard expecting some recognition looks hurt

BIFF (CONTD)
Or at least that’s how it might
seem ‘Course that would be
forgettin’ who the real heroes are

GODDARD
Finally

BIFF
Me I am all the real heroes Me
and my piloting and my incredible
vision and my innate sexual
ferocity

GODDARD
(hurt)
Oh

REPORTER
Biff is there anything you’d like
to say to America

BIFF
Yes If these NASA egg heads can
build me a real rocket ship I can
start doing the kind of things our
space program was intended for
like exposing my privates to Cuba

The reporters cheer Flashes glint of Biff’s giant smile
Meanwhile Don Chipley storms over to our insulted Engineers
DON
You hear that Next time one of my

boys asks for a dick-window you
build it Goddamn JV bullshit
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 9

Don furious walks away leaving Goddard hurt and confused

HOBART
What do you expect Goddard As far
everyone’s concerned we’re nothing
but the help

Dejected the guys turn and begin walking away from the
crowd As they walk

GODDARD
But we do all the work Biff just
sits in it while we turned it on

LEWIS
And Biff’s only here because we
didn’t kill him And I really
thought we were going to kill him

sY
That was very probable

Sy bends down and picks up a bottle cap He pulls out a pair
of pliers and as he walks begins to work on it

HANS VAN BERNER
Sure za Russians got to space
first but zey killed people

LEWIS
Really

HANS VAN BERNER
I know zey killed chimps und dogs
rabbits I heard zey would just run
over cats in the parking lot for
no reason Pluz zey left zem up
dere Pets floating in space
forever It’s horrible

HOBART
And the monkey we shot into space
He got to meet the president

GODDARD
They sure like pilots better

Goddard casts a longing gaze at a group of gorgeous NASA
NURSES totally oblivious to our engineers

LEWIS
Women are just taken in by their
macho attitudes and taut hard
bodies

(MORE )
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 10

LEWIS (CONTD)
Proud and tall like they’ve been
chiseled from stone But not
regular stone the kind of stone
that sweats and wears nothing but
silver space boots

Everybody stops and stares at Lewis - EXCEPT FOR Sy who
TWANG Yanks a metal “DANGER” sign off fuel tank He keeps
building

LEWIS (CONTD)
(off everyone’s looks)
What

HOBART
Lewis have you ever maybe thought
that you might be like gay

LEWIS
Gay What’s gay

GODDARD
It’s when a man is attracted to
other men romantically like
instead of women

LEWIS
(doesn’t believe them)
Cooome oooon

GODDARD
It’s real And more common than
people thought they’re finding

LEWIS
OK you got me Men who like other
men That’s hysterical And even if
it was real I’m a happily married
man See there’s my wife and
our roommate

Sy points to an extremely BUTCH LESBIAN - crew cut flannel
shirt - who has just pulled up in an old TOP-DOWN JEEP
Another butch looking LESBIAN rides shotgun

LEWIS’ WIFE
(honks the horn)
Lou come on Pam and I are gonna’
be late for bowling

LEWIS
See you guys tomorrow

Lewis runs off to the Jeep and drives away with his “wife”
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 11

After a moment of processing they start walking again SNAP
SY breaks off a car antennae and adds it to his “invention”

HANS VAN BERNER
Bah Zese astronauts are doing us a
favor Zere are no real women
around here

GODDARD
And what’s a real woman

HANS VAN BERNER
You know a good American Fraulein
Strong blonde six two six three
makes great strudel and maybe
maybe wouldn’t mind taking a crap
on your chest

HOBART
Hans where are you from again

HANS VAN BERNER
(suddenly defensive)
Where are you from

HOBART
West Virginia

HANS VAN BERNER
Well I’m from Omaha I’ve always
been from dere

HOBART
OK it’s just you talk weird

HANS VAN BERNER

(even more defensive)
You talk weird Everyone in Omaha
talks like me You sound like
youre from anozer country Like
you’re probably secretly a Nazi
or something

GODDARD
Why do you bring up Nazis so much

HANS VAN BERNER
Vhy do YOU

GODDARD
I don’t bring up Nazis so much
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 12

HANS VAN BERNER
YOU JUST DID IT AGAIN Youre crazy
about Nazis You’re hiding stuff
You’re all hiding stuff Zecrets
make me sick

Hans stomps away cursing under his breath

GODDARD

Man they wind them tight in Omaha
HOBART

Seriously
SY (0C)

This will fly now
Hobart and Hans look over AND SEE
Sy now wears a jury-rigged HELICOPTER PACK (like a jet pack
but with helicopter blades) In this impossibly short amount
of time Sy has built it out of the objects he collected

WHIRRRR The blades spin up and Sy slowly rises out of frame
leaving Hobart and Goddard impressed and confused

INT NASA HALLWAY - LATER
As Goddard walks down a hallway something catches his eye
He stops looks in through an open door and sees
INT NASA MEDICAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Nurse Valentine - kind wholesome very pretty -
organizes a tray of medical instruments She doesn’t see
Goddard watching her from the hallway an innocent ogling
NURSE VALENTINE
(turns and sees him)
Goddard What are you doing here

Goddard not quite ready for a conversation is startled

GODDARD
I uh I needed this

Goddard grabs a nearby METAL JUG

NURSE VALENTINE
Three gallons of stool softener
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 13

GODDARD
Um Yes

NURSE VALENTINE
OK but personally I’d celebrate
with champagne

GODDARD
Celebrate

NURSE VALENTINE
You sent Biff to space without
killing him You engineers did it

GODDARD
Wow It is really nice to hear
someone say that People don’t seem
to understand how hard our job is
especially not pretty girls like

you
NURSE VALENTINE
Goddard
GODDARD
(blushing)

Oh no I didn’t mean well I did
but um Thank you

Goddard flashes a bashful smile It’s a cute moment until

BIFF (0C)
I’m here for my exam SO exam me

NURSE VALENTINE
Hello Bi - OH MY DEAR

BIFF has walked into the room COMPLETELY NAKED
Nurse Valentine and Goddard whip their heads away

NURSE VALENTINE (CONT’D)
Biff I’m just drawing blood
there’s no reason for you to be
naked

BIFF
There’s no reason not to be Hell
Goddard don’t mind

GODDARD
(turned away)
I’M NOT LOOKING
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 14

NURSE VALENTINE
Biff please Put a gown on Now

Averting her eyes Valentine holds out a gown Biff takes it

BIFF
Fine For you darlin’

As Goddard and Nurse Valentine turn their backs to him Biff
throws the gown behind him and still totally NAKED

BIFF (CONTD)
OK I’m ready

They both turn back and see Biff naked

NURSE VALENTINE GODDARD
Oh Betsy I saw it again

Nurse Valentine brings her hand up right below her eyes so
she can face Biff without seeing anything below his waist

BIFF (CONTD)
I know right And I think space
made it even bigger ‘Fact I want
you to check Even measured last
night so you’d have some pre-flight
data Here got my length girth
charcoal rubbing for texture

Biff produces out a folded PAPER from behind his back

NURSE VALENTINE
(re the paper)
Where were you holding that

GODDARD
OK I have to go Congratulations
Biff Good flight

BIFF
Congrats right back You pencil
necks hardly screwed up at all See
ya at the parade

GODDARD
(running out of the room)
Sure yes at the penis I mean the
penis parade I mean the regular
parade Without penises Damn it

Very embarrassed Goddard rushes out
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 15

EXT NEW YORK CITY TICKER-TAPE PARADE - DAY
A blizzard of confetti

Goddard Hobart Lewis Sy and Hans stand on the sidelines
complaining to Don Chipley

DON
I know I said you could ride on the
float but they built the darn
thing too small

REVERSE ON The massive phallic ROCKET SHAPED FLOAT Biff
the sole occupant hams it up for the crowd galloping around
in a silver space suit and silver cowboy hat

As Biff starts pulling random women up on the float

DON (CONT’D)
There’s no room for anyone else
But hey you can still walk along
side aaaand you get these

Don hands a SILVER BROOM to Goddard

GODDARD
Brooms

DON
Silver space brooms The ticker-
tape really builds up and you’re
already walkin’
(beat)
Smile fellas this is your day

southern Florida area
The Man pulls out 5 DENNY’S GIFT CERTIFICATES
OUT TO REVEAL Our miserable ENGINEERS are lined up next to
the podium as if they were about to receive medals The four

spectators in the giant auditorium applaud sparsely

MAN (CONTD)
Way to go boys Tip top work

Our Engineers exchange dissatisfied looks

EXT DENNY’S - AFTERNOON
The five Engineers walk out of a Denny’s

LEWIS
That was actually pretty good

HOBART
My steak was delicious
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 17

HANS
I had heard of “eggz at any time”
but I never believed Zen zere zey
vere Eggz all of da time

GODDARD
Hey NO Even if my flapjacks were
lighter than air that does not
make up for these these
indignities I don’t know about you
guys but I could use a drink

Goddard looks down the road to “THE COCKPIT” A run-down
Cape Canaveral honky-tonk The local NASA watering hole

HOBART
You know that place is just for
pilots

GODDARD

Were the chief engineers of NASA’S
space program We’ve got as much of
a right to be there as anybody
Heck Hobart you’re a pilot

Goddards last words hit home for Hobart A sore subject

HOBART
Not anymore Count me out

GODDARD
Fine But you’ll be sorry when
were being showered with -
(keeping expectations low)
- professional courtesy Let’s go

Hobart watches the guys head down the road towards the bar

INT “THE COCKPIT” - MOMENTS LATER

The place is just as run down on the inside Flight
memorabilia clutter the walls All the patrons are either
buff FIGHTER JOCKS or buxom 60s BEAUTIES (very Gidget)

Goddard Lewis Sy and Hans stand at one end of the bar

GODDARD
Hi Can we get some beers Hello

REVERSE ON The BARTENDER - a weathered old pilot - stands
at the other end of the empty bar GLARING at our engineers
and giving them THE FINGER
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 18

GODDARD (CONTD)
(playing it off)
It is pretty busy Happy hour

Just then Goddard and the guys overhear two nearby WOMEN -
gorgeous with bee-hive hairdos and hip hugging mod skirts

BAR CHIPPY 1
That Biff Gimble is so dreamy I
would totally have sex with him

BAR CHIPPY 2
I would have sex with anything
that’s been in space

BAR CHIPPY 1
Even like a helmet

BAR CHIPPY 2
Even like some Tang

The Engineers can’t help but feel encouraged Goddard readies
himself and goes in

GODDARD
(nervous voice cracks)
You know uh we work at NASA

The Women taller than our Engineers spin around and make
eye-contact with a point in the air over Goddard’s head

Disappointed they readjust their gaze to greet Goddards
nervous smile But then they smile when they see his NASA

badge

BAR CHIPPY 1
Youre short for astronauts

GODDARD
Oh we’re not astronauts We’re
engineers

HANS
(seductive)
NASA engineers Ve make zpace
ships und za rockets

sY
And I just made this

SY holds a small AIRPLANE THING he’s just built out of forks
and a napkin dispenser ZOOM It jets out of his hands

The Women are totally turned off
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 19

BAR CHIPPY 2
Um that sounds complicated

BAR CHIPPY 1
Were bad at math

GODDARD
What No look we have very
important jobs
(off the blank stares)
We know Biff Gimble

Just then 2 PILOTS walk over They are
TIP ADONIS - Shaggy blond hair surfer good-looks And

The most all-business intimidating specimen of fighter pilot
perfection ever His face framed by perfect hair and
IMPENETRABLE MIRROR SHADES This is MJR MAJOR BALEHARD

MAJOR BALEHARD
Are you bothering these women

GODDARD
Nooo I don’t - Are we

The Women nod

GODDARD (CONT’D)
Oh

MAJOR BALEHARD
You know this bar is just for
pilots Are you guys pilots

GODDARD

(nervous )

We were just explaining that We’re
uh we’re engineers At NASA

TIP ADONIS
Then you guys gotta leave Unless
you wanna become honorary
pilots

GODDARD

Honorary pilots That sounds nice
right guys

The Engineers nod The Pilots smile maliciously

CUT TO

MUSIC “I Get Around” by the Beach Boys
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 20

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

A CLASSIC CONVERTIBLE bounces down a country road Tip
drives Major riding shotgun looks back at

A ROPE tied to the rear bumper It stretches high into the
air All the way up to

GODDARD LEWIS SY and HANS They are helplessly tied
together and wearing nothing but underwear shoes black
socks and OLD-TIMEY AVIATOR HATS and GOGGLES

They float along tied to the speeding car by the rope and
held aloft by a single PARACHUTE They’re PARAGLIDING

MAJOR
(up to engineers )
YOU’RE DOING GREAT

GODDARD
I don’t think they’re going to let
us drink at their bar

sY
I just made urine

GODDARD
Yes you did

INT NASA LOUNGE - DAY

Hobart wearing his thick glasses sits in the break room A
small black and white TV volume down plays behind him

Looking somber Hobart reads a letter

AIR FORCE OFFICER (VO)
Dear Mr Hobart Beeman your
application to Air Force flight
school has been rejected again
While your horrible eyesight makes
you an unacceptable candidate for
pilot training you have become a
source of great amusement to me and
my fellow officers Please do not
let these nineteen consecutive
rejections discourage you from
applying again In fact should you
try three more times I stand to
win a great deal of money in our
office pool Good work stupid
Sincerely Col Edward Lancer
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 21

Furious Hobart crumples the letter and hurls it across the
room As he does he notices out the window

GODDARD LEWIS SY and HANS half naked and tied together
float down into parking lot They must been have cut loose

The engineers hit the ground but before they can free
themselves wind catches the parachute and

BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP Drags them across the hoods of
several parked cars It’s painful and loud

HOBART
Damn it I told them

Hobart rushes out to help

INT NASA LOUNGE - LATER

Goddard Lewis Sy and Hans are still in their TIGHTEY
WHITIES and AVIATOR HEADGEAR Goddard is ranting although
his attire heavily undercuts the seriousness of his words

GODDARD
This has gone too far

LEWIS
Relax There are worse things than
being stripped down and manhandled
by large men

Everyone takes a moment to look at Lewis then

GODDARD
Building rockets is NOT easy
People need to recognize our work
and stop taking us for granted

HANS
Hey look your fuehrer’s on za TV

President JOHN F KENNEDY has appeared on the little BLACK
AND WHITE TV HOBART turns up the volume

JOHN F KENNEDY (ON THE TV)
(an actual Kennedy speech)
--time for this nation to take a
clearly leading role in space
achievement
(MORE )
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 22
JOHN F KENNEDY (ON THE TV) (CONTD)
I believe that this nation should
commit itself to achieving the
goal before this decade is out of
landing a man on the Moon and
returning him safely to the Earth

CUT TO

ALL OVER THE NATION AMERICANS CELEBRATE THE NEWS
ON AN ARMY BASE - Soldiers listening over a radio cheer
ON THE WASHINGTON MALL - A man listens to a transistor radio

MAN
We’re going to the Moon

The surrounding Americans cheer
IN A FARMHOUSE - A family watching the speech on TV cheers
BACK WITH THE ENGINEERS
Our guys have a very different reaction
ENGINEERS
(horrified)

NOOOOOO0O0000

With terror behind their goggles the Engineers PANIC They
scream and flail scrawny naked limbs

HANS
Does he know how hard dat’s going
to be

GODDARD

Why would he want to do that WHY
As if answering Goddard’s question Kennedy continues
JOHN F KENNEDY (ON THE TV)
We choose to go to the Moon and do
the other things not because they
are easy but because they are
hard
ON THE ARMY BASE - Soldiers cheer
ON THE WASHINGTON MALL - Americans cheer

THE MIDWESTERN FARMHOUSE - The Family is elated
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 23

BACK WITH THE ENGINEERS

GODDARD
That is the worst reason ever for
doing anything EVER

LEWIS
We’re going to kill so MANY PEOPLE

sY
Were going to kill 2 people We’re
going to kill 4 people We’re going
to kill 6 people 8 people -

GODDARD
This isn’t happening It can’t be

SMASH CUT TO

INT DON CHIPLEY’S OFFICE - LATER

Don sits in his beige cinder-block office He leans back in
his chair smirking out across his desk

DON
Oh it’s happening We’re goin’ to

(beat)

And ya’1ll look like morons

REVERSE ON The Engineers are all clothed but four still
wear GOGGLES and HELMETS Lewis’ huge sweat stains are back

GODDARD
US The president’s the one who
doesn’t know that the Moon is
really far away

DON
You will not speak about our - HEY

GODDARD
Sorry If Sy has nothing to fix he
takes apart whatever’s around
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 24

HANS
It’s best to keep some match sticks
around Here Sy how many

Hans dumps out a box of match sticks on the floor Sy shrieks
in glee and dives for them

HANS (CONT’D)

You pull the ‘chute on that right
now mister We are the United
States government We don’t lie we
don’t fake evidence and we don’t
take part in empty gestures of
meaningless publicity We shoot men

GODDARD
We just did that We did it safe
and fast And we did it in spite of
that idiot Biff who ended up
getting all the credit

DON

You got them Denny’s gift
certificates

(off Goddard’s stare)
OK look I’m bringing in new
astronauts Some real smart pilots
Top notch guys And as for respect
maybe you shouldn’t have let the
Russians beat us into space

He’s that Major From the Air Force
Academy The one who ratted you out
when your eyes started going bad

HOBART
Yeah but it’s fine I already see
his face whenever I close my eyes
laughing at me Now I’1l just see

The Command and Service Module or
CSM which will carry three
astronauts from the Earth to lunar

spidery looking LUNAR MODULE (LEM) that landed on the Moon

The LEM or Lunar Module A smaller
craft that will un-dock and allow
two men to land on and take off
from the Moon’s surface

Using two ships instead of one
overcomes the significant weight

They don’t look like space-ships

MAJOR
And only two men land on the Moon

BIFF
Cause there are three of us

TIP
Plus girls

GODDARD
You can’t take girls

BIFF
What’s the point of going to the

GODDARD
The point It’s - Guys we’re the
engineers These are the designs
Don tell them

DON
Weeeeeeell maybe you could make a
compromise or two

Like instead of girls ve build
vibrating artificial vaginas made
of rubber

That’s good We’ll need those ASAP

If it’s OK I’d like to adda
little input

Major walks to the front of the room and begins drawing on
the diagrams

Now what if we change this make
this a bit longer tweak this here

Major steps away to REVEAL

He’s completely drawn over the designs with a childish
picture of a sleek unrealistic 1950’s-futuristic style
ROCKET SHIP

GODDARD
That’s a direct ascent design We
can’t build a ship like that

BIFF
‘Course not

Biff runs up grabs the marker and starts drawing

BIFF (CONTD)
It needs some missiles and nuclear
everything

TIP
And a jacuzzi

BIFF
And a robot butler

Biff draws a little ROBOT WITH A BOWTIE then he draws a
stick figure holding hands with the robot

And how would we get something that
heavy off the ground

build it we can’t afford it it
can’t work

What are we Astro-nots or Astro-
yeses I’m an Astro-YES

Smells like a compromise to me

Great job everyone Who wants ribs

The Astronauts sound off and then follow Don out of the room

The Engineers are in shock

could be a little more practical

Practical Shit Goddard ever since
he was drag racin’ dinosaurs
through the Garden of Eden Man has
dreamed of walking on the Moon
When we make that dream a reality
we can’t worry about what’s
practical or safe or remotely
possible

EXT BEACH PARTY - NIGHT

It’s a 1960s Gidget Style BEACH PARTY Buff PILOTS in tight
trunks and bikini clad BEACH BEAUTIES surround a BON FIRE
Parked MUSCLE CARS light up the party with their headlights

Further down the beach our ENGINEERS walk up in their own
versions of swimwear Sy wears trunks and a shirt and tie
Hans wears LEDERHOSEN Lewis wears briefs and glistens with
sunscreen he holds a TUBE of the stuff - it’s nighttime

HOBART
I don’t think we’re invited

GODDARD
This party wrecked our mission we
deserve it more than anyone
Besides they mentioned it to
everyone it’d just be rude if we
werent -

SLAP Someone throws a HOT DOG at Goddard’s face It knocks
his glasses askew and streaks MUSTARD across his cheek

MAN (0C)
Go home squares

BY THE BON-FIRE Major tells a story

MAJOR
So I ask the eye-doctor why he
wants me to wear glasses that make
my eye-sight worse and he says
“Im afraid you’ll see into my
soul” Then I say “Too late”

Tip runs up to the Bon Fire he’s fresh from the ocean and
soaking wet He carries a SURFBOARD and a drenched GUITAR
water pours from the instrument’s sound-hole

TIP
Hey can anyone help me with some
sex
(to two women)
Great you two come on

Hey Nurse Valentine’s over there

I’m gonna say hi

LEWIS
Wait there’s mustard on your face

Goddard wipes the wrong side of his

LEWIS (CONT’D)
It’s still there Here let me

Lewis reaches out about to tenderly lick Goddard’s face
clean Goddard backs away quick

GODDARD
Thaaat’s thank you I’m good Bye

And Goddard’s gone Then Lewis spots

LEWIS
Look my wife Hey honey

Lewis heads off to talk to his WIFE - who dressed in a plaid

NURSE VALENTINE
Goddard I didn’t expect to see you

here

GODDARD
Yeah Thought I’d celebrate the
launch

NURSE VALENTINE
Even though it ended early and you
missed half your objectives

GODDARD
(thrown nervous)
Yes well still everyone deserves
a break

NURSE VALENTINE
I guess but I saw that crazy ship
youre building You boys better
buckle down Unless you’ve given up
on getting to the Moon safely

Hearing his worst fears thrown back at him Goddards
composure breaks

GODDARD
That’s a very Well put

BIFF (0C)
Hey nurse V take a gander

They look over and see Biff who’s NAKED

NURSE VALENTINE GODDARD
My god There it is again

BIFF (CONTD)

A woman approaches The moonlight hits her face It’s

SHANNON BALEHARD
Hobart

HOBART
Hello Oh

SHANNON BALEHARD
What are you doing over here You
should come join the party

HOBART
Even though they hate us

SHANNON BALEHARD
It’s not like that Major and the
guys are just uncomfortable
around people they don’t respect

A moment passes They look out at the small rolling waves

SHANNON
Hobart I hate that we’re not
friends any more

Hobart whips around to face Shannon the Moon reflecting in
his EXTREMELY THICK GLASSES

HOBART
We were never friends We were in
love Why didn’t you come to Boston
with me We could have had a life
We could have been happy

SHANNON
Hobart please My grandfathers were
pilots My brothers were pilots My
father was a pilot A great pilot
who was never around and left me
with feelings of inadequacy and
abandonment I date pilots

HOBART
Do you know how unhealthy that
sounds

SHANNON

Not at all

board has been completely disassembled

MAJOR

What did you do to my car
sY

I fixed it

Sy licks the small piece of ORANGE BODY PANEL he still holds

SY (CONT’D)
Mmmmmm Tang

Goddard tries to intervene

GODDARD
Major please he can’t help it He
takes everything apart But he’1l
put it back together good as new
Probably better

MAJOR
You better hope he can put his face
back together

HOBART
Get your hands off of him

Hobart pushes through the crowd and steps up to Major who is
suddenly confronted with someone his own size

MAJOR
Hobart we were friends once so
you get a pass Now get lost This
is pilot business
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 55

BIFF
Yeah this is about pilots and
airplanes not pencil necks and
uh and --

TIP
(coming to the rescue)
Perfectly flat mathematical planes

The crowd murmurs impressed by Tip’s insult

HOBART
(in Majors face)
I guess I wouldn’t know about pilot
business anymore It’s been quite a
while since I used to wax your tail
back at the academy

“Oooohs” from the crowd Fighting words

MAJOR
That was luck Hobart Blind luck

HOBART
I was twice the pilot you were and
I could be twice the astronaut

MAJOR
You could never be an astronaut
with those things on your face

HOBART
What Glasses don’t work in space

MAJOR
Glasses EXPLODE in space

HOBART
If I wasn’t grounded I’d take you
on right now

MAJOR
Who needs planes A real pilot can
fly anything even a car

Major snaps his fingers and Swooosh-CATCH Someone tosses
Major a set CAR KEYS which he plucks from the air

HOBART
Fine Let’s race
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010

MAJOR
Not so fast We can’t test our
natural God given piloting ability
with all this extra equipment So
how ‘bout Hobart I’1l take off my
mine if you take off yours

And for the first time Major removes his MIRROR SHADES

ANGELS SING For a moment his perfect eyes seem to GLOW

VOICES IN THE CROWD
Ooooh So perfect I can see
better when he looks at me

HOBART
Fine Whatever No glasses

Hobart rips off his thick blocky glasses

GODDARD
Are you crazy You need those

HOBART
Not to wax this pansy OK Major
let’s race

MAJOR
Hobart I’m over here

REVEAL Hobart was not facing Major

EXT DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

The entire beach party including our Engineers and
have gathered to watch the race

Major sits in a growling CORVETTE ready to go
Hobart pulls up in an ugly shit-brown JALOPY
MAJOR
You want a hand pushing that across
the finish line

HOBART

Don’t be fooled by her looks Under
the hood she’s custom Beeman

Shannon

Hobart stomps on the accelerator It’s the LOUDEST ENGINE
EVER People in the crowd WINCE CRACK The vibrations split

Hobart’s rear window
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 57
In response Major grabs Shannon through the drivers’ side
window and kisses her It’s super sloppy and very lengthy
Hobart looks at them kissing but can’t see what’s happening

HOBART (CONTD)
Nothing to say That’s what I
thought

Biff steps out in front of the two cars

BIFF
First car past Suicide Swerve wins

Goddard sticks his head into Hobart’s window
GODDARD
Hobart please driving Suicide
Swerve without your glasses is
suicide ier

HOBART
Sorry Goddard I have to do this

BIFF
Get ready get set

REVVVV Hobart and Major gun their engines

BIFF (CONTD)
And GO

SCREECH VRRROOOM Major’s car peels out
So does Hobart’s but backwards

HOBART

Hobart blindly struggles with his gear shift Then

CLUNK It engages and VRROOOOM Hobart peels out forward
and right out off the road and out of frame CRASH

HOBART (0C) (CONT’D)
Crap

Again we hear the gears grind engage then VROOM
He zooms back onto the road and off the other side CRASH

HOBART (0C) (CONTD)
It’s OK I got this I’m good

INT EXT HOBART’S CAR - LATER
It seems the blind Hobart has found his groove Outstretched
fists white knuckle the steering wheel His face is pure

determination as he squints into the night

HOBART
OK Major you’re - going - DOWN

Hobart shifts his engine screams and

GODDARDS HEAD pops into view through drives side window

GODDARD
Hobart
HOBART
(startled)

AHHHH Jesus Goddard you can
really run

GODDARD
Actually you’re not uh -

HOBART
I’m not driving anymore am I

OUT TO REVEAL

HOBART’S CAR has driven off the road and into large ditch A
ditch just big enough to catch the car’s front and rear
bumpers and hold it aloft the wheels spinning uselessly in
the air

This is why Hobart thought he was still driving He turns off
the engine The wheels spin down the night gets quiet

HOBART (CONTD)
(doubting)
Did I win

GODDARD
Major did An hour ago

HOBART
Yeah that seems about right
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 59

GODDARD
Don’t feel bad Hobart it wasn’t
fair You didn’t have a chance

HOBART
(snapping)
I KNOW I know damn it

GODDARD
Then why do you let it get to you

HOBART
You think pilots have it all
because of the respect and the
girls and the muscle tone --

GODDARD
My thighs are in pretty good --

HOBART
THEY FLY They fly like gods And
the only thing worse than never
having that feeling is having it
taken away But you couldn’t
understand that cause cause
youre you’re just an engineer

Goddard is caught off guard’s by Hobart’s words A side of
his friend he hasn’t seen a long time

GODDARD
So are you Hobart

HOBART
Don’t remind me

High above Goddard and his sullen friend hangs a hair-thin

INT NASA COMPUTER ROOM - NEXT DAY

The room is filled with an old-school ROOM-SIZED COMPUTER
Big as a house powerful as a pocket calculator

HANS stands by the input-output TERMINAL as he talks to a
group of Engineers including Sy and Lewis

HANS
OK so I “networked” ‘zis computer
to da one in za other room Now I
take ‘zis stack of cards
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 60

HANS holds up a huge stack of INDEX CARDS - Computerized
“PUNCH-CARDS” the oldest of old-school computer programs

HANS (CONTD)
-Which I call my “profile” Den I
feed it in rrrright here like zo

WHIRRRRRRRRRR Hans feeds his stack of cards into the
computer It takes a LONG TIME and it’s really LOUD

HANS (CONT’D)

(yells over the computer)
It’s telling za ozer guy zat my
“user name” is 1 - never use your
real name - and zat I’m interested
in things like da number zero
Then it asks if it wants to be
friends

WHIRRRRRRRRRR The primitive machine is still processing

HANS (CONTD)
Takes a minute or two

Goddard storms into the room

GODDARD
What is going on here

HANS
I call it “My Space” If America
buildz maybe five more computers
it could really take off

GODDARD
We need to be working

HOBART (0C)
What’s the point

Goddard turns A grim looking Hobart has walked in

GODDARD
What do you mean what’s the point
We’re putting a man on the Moon Or
three and maybe some prostitutes

HOBART
I think we all know that’s never
going to happen

GODDARD
No we don’t They don’t Right
Guys
Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 61

All eyes look away Goddard has no support here

HANS
It’s zat ship Goddard Even if ve
veren’t months behind schedule
it’1ll never get off the ground

LEWIS
And the robot butler keeps turning
on us

A murmur of support ripples through the room

Goddard can’t believe what he’s hearing from his crew and
most of all from his best friend

GODDARD
So what we should quit

HANS
No ve should fake it
(mumbles to himself)
Or hide in Brazil

GODDARD
I can’t believe what I’m hearing
We could be the greatest explorers
since Christopher Columbus

LEWIS
Astronauts go to the Moon not us

GODDARD
They’re just along for the ride
Qur ship goes Our ideas go Our
vision And that’s us If there’s a
chance to build the-

HEY Sy NO We need that

Sy has unscrewed one of the computers large panels He’s Arm-
pit deep into the machine wires spilling out everywhere

sY

I’m not doing this

GODDARD
If there’s a chance to build the
greatest machine ever To build
history well then nothing could
make me quit
(right at Hobart)
Cause I’m an engineer
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010

HOBART
Goddard how can you expect us to
believe in this project when you
won’t even stand up for us

Goddard hates to admit it but Hobart has a point

GODDARD
Yeah the astronauts are just so
darn stubborn If only there was a
way to get them to back off a
little To use our ships

HANS
You want to weaken their resolve

GODDARD
Yeah

HANS
Crush zeir spirits

GODDARD
Sure

HANS
Bend zeir will over our knees until
it shatters and zey give in like

France
GODDARD
I’m not really sure if that’s -
HANS
(cutting off the question)
Cause I have some designs for

machines especially designed to
dampen one’s spirits

HANS (CONT’D)
(handing them out)
Zis spins them round and round Zis
drops them from very high up
Here’s one dat shoves stuff up zeir
asses for no reason

The Engineers are shocked as they look over the designs
LEWIS

(re a blueprint)
This one’s called Mengele

“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010

HANS
That’s the designer
(off looks)
Different Mengele

HOBART
(very suspicious)
What were these for

HANS
(covering)
Uhhh You know like for camp

GODDARD
Like summer camp for kids

HANS
Yah und adults too Everyone Und
all year For all the year camp

LEWIS

I’ve never heard of all year camp

screaming “ICH BIN EIN BERLINER” It’s ex-Nazi bedlam
(NOTE - OPERATION PAPERCLIP was real After WWII the US
pardoned over 100 Nazi scientists who built many of America’s
early space rockets and long-range missiles)

Our engineers are dumbfounded

A hundred and twenty six fully
pardoned naturalized US citizens
Most of whom are seriously
reconsidering National Socialism

If this puppy were an astronaut

Emmet raises a PISTOL

surviving such a voyage are no
different than -

Emmet spins the gun’s chamber locks it in raises the gun to

BIFF (CONTD)
Course we might get lonely And
curious Then it’d be only natural
to want to explore each other’s

GODDARD
Uh guys we’re here

Major and Biff freeze mortified at the sound of Goddard’s
crackly voice over their suit radios

They turn and see the ship looming behind them

Hobart notices the pee in Major’s suit

HOBART
Is your suit full of pee

MAJOR
No

Goddard and Hobart start laughing like crazy

GODDARD
Yes Your suit’s full of pee We
told you not to drink that beer

MAJOR
Hey This is a serious malfunction

CLOSE ON Grey lunar dust STOMP A boot steps into frame
leaving that iconic FOOTPRINT-ON-THE-MOON indentation

Goddard and Hobart in moon-suits bound across the Moon
Kicking up dust smiling laughing Time of their lives

Finally they stop out of breath and giddy

GODDARD
You ever think we’d end up here

HOBART
Always dreamt Never thought

GODDARD
Anything really is possible

Goddard points Hobart turns and as he does
The reflection of PLANET EARTH glides across his face shield
A tiny BLUE-GREEN EARTH hangs above the two engineers

GODDARD (CONTD)
Two billion people looking back at
us

HOBART
They say in forty years it’ll be
over six billion

GODDARD
Wow All those people packed
together that tight You’d be so
busy making friends there wouldn’t
be time for war

HOBART
I spent so much of my life so
angry so upset but now all my
problems just seem so small

GODDARD
Especially when you do this

Goddard holds up his thumb and forefinger and begins pinching
the tiny Earth between them He’s CRUSHING THE EARTH

GODDARD (CONTD)
(funny voice)
ARGH I’m a giant and I’m smooshing
the Earth I’m smooshing it GRRRR
“Rocket Men by J Fleisher 31010 100

HOBART
Oh Oh watch this I’m punching
the Earth I’m punching the Earth
right in its Earth face

Hobart starts gleefully punching the air

GODDARD
Oh yeah Look at me

Goddard squats down with the Earth to his back
GODDARD (CONT’D)
Look I’m pooping out the Earth
I’m pooping the whole Earth

Indeed from Hobart’s POV Goddard looks like he’s pooping
out the Earth

MAJOR (0C — RADIO)
Are you guys done out there

Now it’s Goddard and Hobart’s turn to be embarrassed

GODDARD HOBART

What are you doing here

Major and Biff stand in the lounge staring at our Engineers

MAJOR
Weve got a bone to pick with you

BIFF
With all a’ ya’ll

The ship begins to shake more violently

BIFF (CONTD)
This ship is terrible It’s slow
unresponsive and from what I can
see out the window mostly on fire

GODDARD
Weve begun reentry You need to
get back up there and fly this
ship

MAJOR
Maybe you didn’t hear us The ship
is substandard and we refuse to fly
it

GODDARD
What You’re quitting because -

BIFF
Hey Don’t deflect This is about
you and the crappy space-ship you
built

BOOM The ship JOLTS violently BOXES fly off an overhead
shelf They hit Biff and Major knocking the men unconscious

Goddard unstraps rushes over and reads the label on one of
the boxes “NASA VAGINA ARTIFICIAL”

GODDARD
Damn these fake vaginas

They’re alive but they’re out
Hobart you’re taking us in

Sy holds up his hands still encased in boxing gloves

Goddard leans over yanks on the gloves and POP POP They
fly off Sy is FREE He dives under the Control Panel

In moments MUSIC BLARES and Sy pops his head up

Sy dives back under and after a few moments

VIOLENTLY Our Engineers’ heads snap forward with whiplash

GODDARD (CONTD)
Is it fixed Are the controls back

HOBART
Yes But we’ve got a bigger

at the bottom of his helmet SO CLOSE but SO FAR

Military officers politicians and dignitaries are seated
behind an ornate stage In front of them a CROWD OF
THOUSANDS stretches as far as the eye can see

Major steps up to a podium flanked by Biff Tip and Don

Our Engineers Nurse Valentine and Shannon stand on the
stage but WAAAAY off to the side

Again Major unfolds a piece of paper

MAJOR

I’m sorry I can’t do this

BIFF
All that’s true but what’s more
true is that no astronaut does
nothin’ without the scientists and
math- mathusels- mothamus -

TIP
(whispers to Biff)
Mathematicians

BIFF

(back to Tip)
That sounds made up

(to audience)
Without the scientists and
mathletes who make our jobs
possible I’d like some of those
boys to come on up here right now

Biff looks toward Goddard and the other Engineers who are
totally confused

BIFF (CONTD)
That’s right ya’ll You I said
come up here Come on

A BRASS BAND strikes up and suddenly thousands of people are
cheering for our Engineers

Goddard and Hobart exchange surprised looks and then begin
to make their way to the podium but not before

Goddard grabs Nurse Valentine’s hand

GODDARD
He means you too Come on

As Goddard leads the group to the podium

MAJOR
They’re the heart and soul of NASA
and the best our country has to
offer

reach out to shake their hands and pat them on the back

PIPE to our Engineers

WILT CHAMBERLAIN gives Goddard a “Right On”
ELVIS PRESLEY in his sparkling jump-suit “Karate-Points”

Finally Goddard and the Engineers reach the podium

Hans looks out and sees His tall BLONDE BOMBSHELL from the
Fake Moon Shoot They exchange coy waves

Lewis catches the eye of a HANDSOME MALE REPORTER who winks
Lewis is shocked at first but then he smiles back

Major turns to Hobart He takes off his Mirror shades and
holds out his hands

MAJOR
That was some damn fine flying
Beeman I’d be honored to put ina
good word with the Air-Force
