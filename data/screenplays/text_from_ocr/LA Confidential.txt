We can see Dudley doesnt approve

DUDLEY
You dont have the eye for human
weakness to be a good detective
Or the stomach Youre a
political animal Edmund

The criticism stings but Dudleys a straight shooter

EXLEY
Youre wrong

DUDLEY
Am I Would you be willing to
plant corroborative evidence on a
suspect you knew was guilty in
order to ensure an indictment

EXLEY

DUDLEY
Answer yes or no

EXLEY

DUDLEY
Would you be willing to rig crime
scene evidence to support a
prosecuting attorneys working
hypothesis Yes or no Edmund

EXLEY
No

DUDLEY
Would you be willing to beat
confessions out of suspects you
knew to be guilty

EXLEY
No

DUDLEY
Would you be willing to shoot
hardened criminals in the back to
offset the chance --

EXLEY
No

DUDLEY
Then for Gods sake dont be a
detective Stick to assignments
where you wont have to make those
choices Patrol Internal
Affairs but not the Bureau

down

The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in
Four men with rifles One is Patchetts Burly Bodyguard
They spot Exley lying there Hushed whispers as they
approach Dead meat Be careful Kicks in the
side The men look at each other sneer

Exley jerks a foot The foot man stumbles as Exley spins
around SHOOTING FIRING the 45 and his own 38 All
four men go down Exley stands digs into his pocket to
reload

Bud scrambles back through the window Exley looks over
and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun Its dead quiet

EXLEY
Im thinking we might walk away
from this

At that instant Dudley steps through the bathroom door
Hes got Exley dead to rights As he squeezes the
trigger Bud leaps forward pushes Exley hard to the
ground

The SHOT passes through Buds back by his left shoulder
blade It spins him around A SECOND SHOT to the
stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley A
THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Buds jaw but still he comes
Driven by rage his hands reaching for Dudleys throat
He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest

Bud falls hard

Dudley swings his aim to Exley whos just managed to
shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud A frozen
moment

The car moves A turn into traffic a good-bye TOOT on
the HORN Exleys all alone As he watches them go

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
