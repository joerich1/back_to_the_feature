NOVEMBER Revisions
‘November 21 2003
I stood upon a high place
And I saw below many deviis
Running leaping
‘and cavorting in sin
one looked up grinning
And said “Comrade Brother”

-- Stephen Crane

The entrance to the Denton Towers was
clogged with police cars and curiosity
seekers

“wonder what’ s wrong there” Liddell
asked

The cabby grunted “Some dame “probably
gave herself the deep six The joint’s
full of kepties and every so often they
come out of those windows like leaves in
a rainstorm”

EXT WOODED PARK - WITH HARMONY

HARMONY crouched low 38 held loosely at her side
Low MIST inches off the ground The lamps have HALOS

She moves forward at a dead run In and out through the
trees Eyes roving --

Thats when she first notices THE GIRL

Harmony ducks behind a tree Watches the girl stroll out
of the park

Now Harmony sprints uphill to a BRICK WALL

The one that borders the park Roughly five feet high
Finds she can stay to this side of it and still see the
STREET where Pink-Haired Girl walks

Still a block downrange Harmony looks back at the park
Reacts startled

Now theres a strange MAN in the park

Strolling south eating peanuts She fidgets Peers
over the wall again --

THERE HE IS THERES PERRY

Coming out of a LIQUOR STORE two blocks down Harmony
heaves a HUGE sigh of relief

aAmbles along shadowing PINK- HATRED GIRL his
aforementioned surveillance job No idea Harmonys near--

Except shes not so near not anymore Shes 75 yards
away She creeps along the wall Keeping him in sight

ANOTHER ANGLE - HEADLIGHTS

A car nearing the park She thinks nothing of it
Glances up as it goes bythen promptly turns to STONE --

THE BLUE IMPALA is back in the picture

Gliding like an Angel of Death She watches terrified

A GUN MATERIALIZES in his hand like a magicians trick
and WITHOUT A THOUGHT he sticks it out behind him and
while rolling blows two shots backward at the Impala --

Less than two MINUTES Whatever the case shes back --

And ‘SOMEONE ELSE is back Harry hears a male VOICE

Shes RIGHT THERE inches away on the carpet

Back arched spastically Mouth open

wide in shock --

SHE SEES HARRY All of a sudden sees a strange man
under her bed Maybe five seconds left to her Says

PINK HAIR
Who are you

Her eyes inches from his The two of them close as
lovers And Harry panics Reacts instinctively

Jams a finger to her lips CUTS HER OFF

Withdraws it Presses it to his own lips Eyes pleading
with her please oh please be quiet

Her mouth works soundlessly The light behind her eyes
dimming She looks to him afraid IMPLORING —-

He wills her SILENT thats right honey just for the
next few seconds good girl

Seconds are all she has She passes them in pain --

And then obediently silent she dies

The lights go out Her breath escapes Harry having
denied her a single word This will haunt him for as
long as he chooses to live ae

He shifts his attention watches the tailored slacks exit
the room Hears something plunk on the dresser top

HARRY peeks his head out Looks to the dresser -- There
- Sitting all by its lonesome A silenced AUTOMATIC

The son of a bitch left his gun

Harry breaks cover Climbs to his feet Crosses to the
dresser An automaton Calmly claims the gun

Checks the safety Flicks it off Turns hearing
FOOTSTEPS approach Grits his teeth Bides his time --

MR FIRE DOESNT SEE HIM at first Appears in the
doorway putting on gloves Blanket over his shoulder

Then he does see Harry Guys a pro gotta give it to
him A flicker of reaction thats all

MR FIRE

Strikes the freeway OVERPASS Ricochets off whipsaws
COFFIN EJECTED--

The ornate crate SAILS end over end glistening
Comes down wham-- Atop the big GREEN FREEWAY SIGN
Lodges in the struts Stuck

The COFFIN BURSTS OPEN not all the way --

Enough to admit one trailing HAND

One dead girls hand dangling limp over the freeway
Spotlighted Festooned with Christmas lights

Got it Good Now lets wind theclock back 5 seconds
because another concurrent result of the crash is --

HARMONY FLUNG LOOSE--

Expelied along with the coffin

MUD-SLOPE - BESIDE FREEWAY
Parting gift the door CRUNCHES her leg --

Then shes tumbling free Downslope head over heels
bouncing skipping-- Toward the rushing TRAFFIC

Events now accelerate the next 5 pages all in a rush --
Harmony slams to a stop Breath driven from her lungs

Above her THE CASKET looms backlit Strangely
beautiful She gapes wide-eyed 7

Pow-- MUD spattered She spins startled --
SOMEONE JUST SHOT AT HER

There Up at the fence -- the SEDAN A shadowy
FIGURE raising his arm

She acts on instinct Rolls BENEATH THE OVERPASS --

Almost gets away clean POW-- A bullet tags her
Oh shit CREASES HER skull-deep

She flops in the surrounding dark A rag doll as ABOVE --

And that brother is when it goes all to hell

The guy reacts spins smoothly GUN coming up

Events proceed in the following order
GAY PERRY

Flings himself in front of Harry One continuous move gun
materializing blooming --

Perfect Perry takes out the gunman Blows him down

Unfortunately in the last second of his life the unhelpful
badguy fires back-

Also dead on target Perrys chest registers impact

Bang-bang everybody gets hit Fuck In three seconds
the entire world changes

First the GUNMAN goes down drilled through the neck
Then PERRY grunts staggers PIERCED
Still not done The slug burns through him EXITS
Keeps on GOING --

HITS HARRY

Upper thigh A soft smack of sound Hes puzzled at first
Suddenly SEATED Punched by an invisible fist --

SEEN FROM AFAR

Two tiny figures collapse in the rain
A third plops flat on his ass

Three stark seconds Awkward brutal

Perry’s not getting up

MEANWHILE THE SEDAN TAKES OFF

Sweeps out onto the boulevard slewing rain as
HARRY

Crawls toward Perry who lies slack and unmoving
He stares incredulous No Wrong

HARRY
Perry GET UP
As if in response the GUN slips from Perrys hand

PUSH IN ON HARRY -- Staring dumbstruck

HARRY
You shit don’t do this to me

Something tells him to cast a look DOWNRANGE he does --
“HIS POV 14 MILE AWAY

Oh shit THE SEDAN isnt through yet Its slowing
swinging onto an on-ramp -- Heading BACK this direction

Back to finish off Harmony

“Harry freaks stumbles to his feet 38 Half out of his

MUSIC I Will Survive

Sees Perrys PHONE lying dented Numbly regards the
flashing ID window -- Who the hell

the button

HARRY
Harmony

He frowns STATIC at first Then scarcely audible

HARMONY Harold use awesome might

The words richochets in his awareness

HARMONY
Save me from this hopeless plight

Resonating He closes his eyes Oh Christ

In the downpour he plants his elbows Levers himself
up Grits his teeth Gets a knee under him PUSHES

Trembling he stands Draws himself to his full height
Soaked bleeding Hands shaking

Staggers to the overpass WALL Head down Bleary
LIGHTNING flares-- Fills the sky Etches HAROLD in
sharp relief He looks out upon the zipping VORTEX
Reaches in his jacket for his 38

‘Oh shit Hes gonna try it from up HERE

THUNDER rolls He swipes rain from his eyes Braces the
-38 on the overpass Draws down on the incoming car

Takes dead aim So focused he almost doesnt hear it

At first a purr then a burgeoning roar Turn
around He whirls --

A speeding car ANOTHER ONE hes stunned “

HARLAN DEXTER Right on TOP of him Its finished he
hasnt a fucking chance

Harry doesnt think simply flings himself UP AND
SIDEWAYS as the car SLAMS THE WALL where his legs were
-1l7

Mr Agility our boy -- only one problem he cant STOP
himself Momentum too great simply keeps on rolling --

’ RIGHT OFF THE EDGE into space into open AIR tumbling --

WIND rushing CARS blurring past

Slams headfirst into the big green FREEWAY SIGN

Collides with it arms flailing Clutching desperately -
DAMMIT No traction too WET-- Last chance --

CATCHES HOLD Got it Unbelievably lurches to a stop
He dangles kicking

Hanging onto RONNIE DEXTERS ‘DEAD HAND

and maybe for a lunatic second we think she reached
from beyond the grave that shes the one clutching him --

A lovers grip as she SUSPENDS him above the freeway

HARRY blinks away rain Gasping His 38 REVOLVER
stayed up above On the EDGE barrel protruding

He casts about despairing Something anything

The overpass starts to VIBRATE Remember page 5 the
thing that began this mess Its okay I dont either

In any event at that moment a CITY BUS RUMBLES PAST

“ON -THE REVOLVER it jitters vibrates FALLS

HARRY moves fast The GUN whistles by -- out of the dark
comes a magic-quick HAND Rain-slick minus a finger --

Plucks the weapon from thin air Impossible

Reels it in SPINS it Acquires the TRIGGER A

raises his arm -—- uc

ABRUPTLY DROPS ‘Plunges 5 feet Stops ka-chuk--

DRAWS DOWN On the speeding sedan HARMONY stirring

BUCKLES THE ROOF
Of the sliding SEDAN Strikes it dead center

Rolls his head An inch from his nose the back window
Frosted with blood inside Like a malted glass

Feels the car come to a HALT watches oddly detached as

Gets out a foot away Sees HARRY Goes for his pistol
and Harry just flaps the 38 at him --

Lost count A BULLET SPIKES UPWARD through the roof

Oops Forgot one Harry annoyed Jams his-muzzle
