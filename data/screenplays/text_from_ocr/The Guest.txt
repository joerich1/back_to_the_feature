(Final shooting draft)
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - EARLY MORNING

In the light of early morning a young man RUNS along the
side of a country road He has a MILITARY RUCKSACK slung
over his shoulders and is wearing an ARMY uniform

The young man’s hair is cropped short and he has an
athletic build Although he is running steadily at a fast
rate the man’s breathing is quiet and regular

The man in the army uniform continues to run as an old
PICK-UP TRUCK appears in the distance behind him

INT ANNA’S CAR - EARLY MORNING - CONTINUOUS

ANNA PETERSON a pretty 20 year old with dark hair
drives the pick-up truck down the country road Her eyes
are tired and her mascara smeared as if she has been up
all night

Anna looks through her windshield at the man running on
the side of the road He is running in the same direction
that Anna is driving so she sees only his back

Anna frowns slightly at this sight then continues
driving moving past the young man as he runs along
Glancing at her rearview mirror Anna watches his figure
recede into the distance behind her

EXT PETERSON HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - A HALF HOUR LATER
Anna pulls her truck into the driveway of a single-story
house surrounded by fields of dead grass Two other cars
are parked in the driveway an SUV and a station wagon
Paper HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS hang outside of the house
and a homemade GHOST stands in the front yard facing the
street its eyes black holes etched into white bedsheet

Anna climbs out of the truck Behind her the sun is
beginning to rise filling the sky with pale light

Anna regards the ghost standing in front of her then
heads towards the house
INT PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - MORNING

Anna opens the front door to the house and enters moving
quietly as if trying to not be heard
Anna softly shuts the door behind her She turns and sees
her father SPENCER PETERSON 40s seated on the couch in
the dim morning light watching her He is wearing slacks
and a dress shirt and holding a mug of coffee

Anna slumps back against the closed front door startled

ANNA
Oh Hey
(pause)
Youre up early

SPENCER
Not really Where have you been

ANNA
I worked late then went over to
Kristen’s I told mom

SPENCER
It’s six in the morning Anna

Anna moves from the door towards the hallway

ANNA
Yeah um I fell asleep Sorry

SPENCER
If you’re going to stay under our roof
you need to respect our rules

Walking down the hall Anna replies without looking back

ANNA
I said I was sorry

Alone Spencer stands in the front room facing the hall
The sound of Anna CLOSING her bedroom door is audible

Spencer turns to the mantle above the fireplace A
plastic jack-o’-lantern sits next to photos of a young
man smiling in various settings This is CALEB PETERSON

There is a shot of Caleb in a football uniform and most
recently a posed shot of him in an army uniform
standing with a group of soldiers in front of a military
vehicle An AMERICAN FLAG is folded into a glass frame
that hangs over these photos

Spencer exhales his shoulders slumping
INT PETERSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING

Luke and Spencer sit across from each other at the dining
room table Luke is eating breakfast cereal

LAURA PETERSON Anna’s mother enters the room with a
travel mug of coffee which she sets in front of Spencer

LAURA
There you go

SPENCER
Thank you

Laura sits down and begins sipping from a mug of tea
LAURA
Do you know when Anna got in last night

I didn’t hear her

Spencer hesitates

SPENCER
I think I heard her come in just before
midnight Her car’s in the driveway

Laura nods absently Spencer turns to Luke
SPENCER (CONTD)
Luke You asked any girls to the fall
dance yet

Luke flushes and looks down at his cereal bowl

SPENCER (CONTD)
That’s a no

LUKE
I told you dad I’m not interested in
any of the girls at my school

SPENCER
Ah well Wait ‘til you get off to
college You done with breakfast

LUKE
Yeah

Spencer rises to his feet and kisses Laura on the cheek

SPENCER
See you later
LAURA
Okay Drive safe

Luke gets up from the table shouldering his backpack

LUKE
Bye mom

Spencer and Luke exit through the front door

For a long moment Laura stands in the suddenly quiet
room staring off into space Then she blinks and begins
collecting the used dishes from the dining table

INT PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY

Laura sits on the sofa in front of the television The
TV set is on off and she is not looking at it her gaze
resting somewhere in the middle of the floor

The doorbell RINGS

Laura looks up startled She clumsily rises to her feet
straightens her clothing then moves to the front door
and opens it

The YOUNG MAN in army uniform who Anna saw running is
standing on the porch facing away from the door as if
surveying the front yard He is still carrying his
rucksack his back to Laura

Laura gasps her eyes widening The young man turns to
her smiling politely He is very good looking ina
boyish way with very short blond hair This is DAVID

David takes in Laura’s expression He frowns concerned

DAVID
Mrs Peterson

Laura blinks swallowing
LAURA
Yes um I’m sorry I just
(trails off)
Who are you

David extends his hand

DAVID
My name is David Mrs Peterson

They shake hands briefly
DAVID (CONTD)
I knew your son Caleb We served
together We were friends

Laura takes this in

LAURA
Won’t you come inside

DAVID
Thank you ma’am That would be nice

INT PETERSON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

David sits at the dining room table his rucksack on the
floor next to him His hands are folded on the table in
front of him He looks around the room with interest

From the kitchen Laura calls out to him

LAURA (0S)
Are you sure I can’t get you anything

DAVID
Maybe just some water would be nice

Laura comes into the room with a glass of ice water
which she hands to David

DAVID (CONTD)
Thank you ma’am

David drinks the water obviously very thirsty

LAURA
How um how did you get here

DAVID
I ran I needed the exercise
(off Laura’s look)
From the bus station I mean In town

LAURA
But that must be at least twenty miles

DAVID
I guess so Probably about that

LAURA
You ran all that way
DAVID
Yes ma’am Of course I didn’t exactly
know how far outside of town you all
lived when I started The guy at the bus
station who gave me directions made it
sound like it was only a mile or two

David smiles ruefully

LAURA
When did you um get out

DAVID
I was just discharged on Wednesday I
came straight here from Fort Kennilworth

LAURA
You came here first thing

DAVID
Yeah I wanted to come by sooner but I
couldn’t get leave

LAURA
Why

DAVID

Well I was discharged because I was
wounded I was in a military hospital for
a bit so it wasn’t really the kind of
thing I could get leave from But don’t
worry it was just a bit of shrapnel in
my back I’m right as rain now

LAURA
No I mean why um-

DAVID
Oh why I’m here Well like I said me
and your son Caleb we were pretty
close I was with him when he died

LAURA
(strained)
Oh really
DAVID

Yes ma’am And one of the things he

asked was for me to check on you all

You and your whole family here And he

wanted me to tell you that he loved you
(MORE )
DAVID (CONTD)
He specifically wanted me to tell each
one of you that he loved you and that he
was thinking of you guys up until the
end I said I’d do that so here I am

Laura nods slowly

LAURA
Would you hold on a moment please

DAVID
Of course

Laura rises from her chair exiting the room David
drinks from his glass of water

INT PETERSON HOUSE - LAUNDRY AREA - MOMENTS LATER

In a small laundry area Laura leans over the washing
machine SOBBING a dish towel clamped tightly over her
mouth to muffle the sound

After a moment Laura straightens as if trying to
compose herself She rubs her face with the dish towel

INT PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Laura enters from the hallway her face dry but still
flushed

David is no longer in the dining room Laura looks
around

David is standing in the front room his rucksack on the
floor next to him in front of the mantle He is looking
over the photos of Caleb surveying each one

Laura moves into the room behind David He turns to her

DAVID
That’s me

David points at the photo of the soldiers posing in front
of the military truck Laura moves up closer to look

In the photo leaning against the tank a few feet away
from the other soldiers is a YOUNGER VERSION OF DAVID
his head shaved He is squinting into the camera

Laura blinks examining the photo
LAURA
Well I’l1l be

DAVID
I remember that day

David looks at the photo in silence for another second
then leans down and lifts his rucksack

DAVID (CONTD)
It wasn’t my intention to upset you
ma’am I probably should have called
first but I don’t own a phone yet and I
guess I just wasn’t thinking I’m going
to be on my way but I’d like it if we
could exchange emails or something

As David turns away Laura reaches out and grabs his arm

LAURA
No

David turns towards her surprised

LAURA (CONT’D)
Um Anna Caleb’s sister she works
nights so she sleeps late But I’m sure
she’d like to meet you Won’t you stay a
bit longer

DAVID
Youre not just saying that to be polite
Because you don’t need to be

LAURA
I’m not Please stay It’s nice having
you here and I’d like to hear more
about about you and Caleb

DAVID
Well Alright
INT PETERSON HOUSE - ANNA’S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Anna lies on her bedsheets in her underwear her eyes
closed The sound of LAUGHTER echoes in the house

Anna’s eyes blink open She looks around puzzled
INT PETERSON HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Both David and Laura are sitting on the sofa Laura
smiling listing to David tell a story

DAVID
and so Caleb and me we figure well
that sounds more like a challenge than
anything else So that night after he
falls asleep we kind of crept over to
his cot with a tube of superglue-

LAURA
Oh no

DAVID
Oh nah we didn’t do anything too bad to
him - though we could have

Anna enters the room wearing a short-skirted DINER
UNIFORM David immediately rises to his feet Anna
regards him with confusion

BARTENDER
Cinnamon schnapps and Tabasco sauce yep

DAVID
That’s my drink of choice Let me get one
of those a coke for my brother and I

each a blowjob shot

The bartender blinks down at David

BARTENDER
Are you serious

David places a 100 bill on the table

DAVID
I am yes

BARTENDER
Did you want to buy anything for their
fellas

DAVID
(amused)

of those guys there a cosmopolitan

BARTENDER
Ah I don’t know what you’re going for
but I was thinking a beer

DAVID
No Blowjob shots for the ladies and a
cosmopolitan for each of the guys

on top of it

DAVID

David takes a sip from the fireball It appears to have
no affect on him

LUKE
How do you do that

DAVID
You get used to it

Behind Luke the bartender crosses to the booths with a
tray filled with drinks He hands out Irish cream shots
to the girls and pink martinis to the guys The girl
seated next to Ian starts laughing loudly

All of the seniors turn to look towards David who
ignores them Luke watches them apprehensively

regards the seated David

Ian FLINGS the contents of his glass into David’s FACE

David sits the drink running down his face He calmly
wipes his eyes then reaches for his FIREBALL SHOT

DAVID
Ah Maybe you could try this instead

David lightly tosses the fireball shot into Ian’s face
Ian takes a step back blinking Then he SCREAMS

IAN
My eyes

Ian hunches forward clutching his eyes and HOWLING with
pain Blair moves towards him confused David LAUGHS
then rises to his feet

David reaches past Blair and TAPS Ian’s shoulder

DAVID
Hey over here

David ducks back and Ian blind SWINGS his fist out He
HITS BLAIR in the face knocking him to the floor

David again bursts into LAUGHTER

DAVID (CONT’D)
Ha Wow Okay

David stops laughing He steps forward and PUNCHES IAN IN
THE NECK Ian DROPS TO THE FLOOR

Mike and Jason are moving towards David who turns to
face them Jason attempts to tackle David David brings
his knee up into Jason’s face sending him flying back

Luke is on his feet but seems to not know what to do He
is abruptly SPUN AROUND by Mike who PUNCHES LUKE in the
face knocking him to the floor

Luke lies on the floor dazed Mike moves to KICK Luke
but is HIT FROM BEHIND WITH A POOL CUE by David The
stick BREAKS across Mike’s back

Mike falls to the ground next to Luke Through Luke’s
blurred vision he can see David stomping on Mike’s KNEE
then ANKLE BONES CRACK Mike SCREAMS

Luke blinks losing consciousness

Blair staggers to his feet He grabs an empty beer bottle
and swings it down at David’s head

David neatly sidesteps pins Blair’s arm and pulls the
bottle from his grasp He then SMASHES the bottle across
Blair’s face then JABS the BROKEN BOTTLE NECK into
Blair’s shoulder

bottle neck protruding from his jersey Blair’s eyes roll
up and he FAINTS falling to the floor

David looks around the room Luke Blair Jason and Mike
are unconscious on the floor Ian is sobbing underneath a
table holding his eyes The remaining senior girls are
cowering away from David in a booth

David leans down and gently SLAPS Luke’s face

DAVID (CONTD)
Hey Luke Wake up
Luke’s eyes open

DAVID (CONTD)

David rises and approaches the bar The bartender is
holding a sawed-off POOL STICK frozen in place behind
the bar The two old men shrink away from David

DAVID (CONTD)

and demanded you serve them drinks You
tried to ID them but they threatened to
cause trouble There was a fight You

The bartender looks at David
DAVID (CONTD)
Otherwise I imagine you and this place
could get in trouble for serving minors
I mean this is what happens Here

David takes two more 100 bills from his pocket and sets
them down on the bar

horizon carrying his rucksack Craig and Higgins turn at
his approach

Craig nods and raises a hand in greeting David returns
the wave as he approaches

DAVID

walk I’m not late am I

HIGGINS
No youre on time

DAVID
Great

HIGGINS

Before we start anything here I’d like
to see that you’ve got some cash on you
if you don’t mind

Craig shrugs apologetically but David is already
reaching into his rucksack He takes out a thick envelope
of 100 bills opening it for Higgins to see

DAVID
That should be good

HIGGINS
Yes indeed

David pockets the envelope Higgins faces the truck

HIGGINS (CONTD)
Craig here didn’t seem to know exactly
what you might be looking for so I
brought a few options

DAVID
Good

Higgins unlocks an aluminum box in the rear bed of the
pick-up truck raising its lid It is filled with
FIREARMS and boxes of BULLETS

HIGGINS

You looking for a rifle or a handgun
DAVID

Handgun
HIGGINS

Figured so Now some of these guns might
have numbers on them and some don’t The
prices vary but they’re all in top
condition and ready to fire Here

Higgins reaches into the box and removes four handguns
as well as two boxes of bullets He carries this load
over to a flat rock area followed by Craig and David

Higgins sets down the guns laying them out
HIGGINS (CONTD)
Youve got your Beretta there I’m sure
youre used to that one Don’t know if
youve fired this before Nine millimeter
Witness Elite Similar weapon but I
prefer the recoil action almost no kick

chamber checking the gun then begins rapidly TAKING
GUN APART checking each piece Higgins watches him

HIGGINS (CONT’D)

HIGGINS

THE

Higgins reaches behind himself and pulls a SMALL REVOLVER
from a holster in his belt He aims the gun at David

HIGGINS (CONTD)
If you think I’d come-

David reaches out and GRABS the wheel of the revolver in
Higgins’ hand holding it tightly

With his other hand David snatches up another revolver
and SNAPS IT OPEN

Higgins eyes suddenly wide tries to COCK THE REVOLVER
pulling the hammer back The wheel rotates slightly then
David squeezes the gun harder STOPPING IT

The bullet loaded in Higgins’ small revolver is just a
centimeter away from being under its hammer

Using his free hand David grabs a bullet and loads it
into the revolver without looking He snaps the chamber
wheel in and raises the gun to aim it at Higgins COCKING
IT Higgins’ face goes slack Craig stares frozen

CRAIG
Oh shit

Craig spins and starts RUNNING towards the quarry’s exit

David pulls the trigger on the revolver aimed at Higgins
The hammer hits an empty chamber The gun CLICKS

Higgins grabs onto the small revolver he is aiming at
David with BOTH HANDS-just as David pulls the trigger of
his revolver a third time SHOOTING HIGGINS IN THE FACE
and BLOWING THE BACK OF HIS HEAD OFF

As Higgins’ body jerks back David yanks the small
revolver from his grasp

Craig is RUNNING AWAY in the distance nearing the exit
to the quarry frantically scrambling up its slope

David aims the small revolver out inhales then slowly
EXHALES He shifts the gun so that it is pointed just
slightly in front of Craig and PULLS THE TRIGGER

The gun FIRES

For a fraction of a second nothing happens Then the

back of Craigs head EXPLODES from the bullet’s impact
and Craig falls to the ground his dead body skidding

through the gravel from its momentum
David regards the two corpses in front of him for a
moment then stands and wipes the small revolver clean on
his shirt He kneels and places it in Higgins’ hand
closing Higgins’ fingers around it multiple times

David turns around He collects all of the handguns and
bullets from the rock placing them in his rucksack
David then climbs into the back of the pick-up truck to
peer inside the aluminum box

The box contains two single barrel SHOTGUNS and an
ASSAULT RIFLE as well as boxes of bullets David lifts
these out

Beneath the assault rifles is a GRENADE David looks at
it

Laura frowns carrying a pan over to the stove

LAURA
Sure sweetie what’s going on

ANNA
I called the military base David said he
was just discharged from Fort
Kennilworth to ask about him

LAURA
What Why would you do that

Anna starts to speak but stops at the sound of the front
door opening Spencers voice calls out

SPENCER (0S)
Hey is anyone home

LAURA
We’re in here

Spencer enters the kitchen looking pale

SPENCER
I need a drink

Spencer crosses to a liquor cabinet and pours whiskey out
into a tumbler

LAURA
What- Spencer what is it

SPENCER
They found Allan my boss He’s been
missing from work the last couple of
days and people were getting worried so
one of his friends broke into his home

Spencer takes a quick drink of whiskey

SPENCER (CONTD)
They found him and his girlfriend dead
Theyd both taken pills I guess he had
some prescriptions It looks like a
suicide pact kind of thing

LAURA
Oh my god But that- That doesn’t make
any sense He was

SPENCER
Totally normal Yeah The police are
investigating There was nothing in their
wall safe but it wasn’t broken into
but she had some bruises I guess we’ll
have to see what the police say

LAURA
Maybe one of them was like dying of
cancer or something

SPENCER
I guess we’ll find out

Spencer finishes his drink

SPENCER (CONTD)
The damned thing is this means I’m
regional manager At least for a while
As soon as corporate heard I got a call
They’re offering me the same salary as
Allan to start right away

whiskey He glances towards the doorway

can reach in and scoop all the guts out

Luke takes a steak knife and begins sawing a hole in the
top of the pumpkin with effort David picks up a knife
and starts to do the same David then stops examining
the knife

DAVID
Your parents’ knives suck

LUKE
Yeah

David sets down the steak knife he is holding then
removes a BUTTERFLY KNIFE from his pants pocket

Anna What’s wrong

ANNA
My um my friend Craig died today He

Oh my goodness That shooting at the
quarry

ANNA
Yeah

LAURA

We just heard about that on the radio

Laura crosses quickly to Anna

ANNA
And and they arrested Zeke for it
they found the gun in his van But he
didn’t do it They were good friends

LAURA
Zeke

Spencer sets down his book

SPENCER
I’m sorry Anna but if they arrested
your ex-boyfriend it could be for a good
reason Zeke Hastings was never exactly a
pillar of the community

Anna’s eyes blaze with fury

ANNA
He’s not my ex-boyfriend dad he’s my
boyfriend I never stopped seeing him
I’m twenty years old I can date who I
want

Spencer’s face flushes

SPENCER
As long as you’re in this house-

ANNA
(interrupting)
You know absolutely nothing about him
You don’t know Zeke at all

SPENCER
I know he’s a druggy burn-out who started
dating my daughter when she was seventeen-

ANNA
Oh yeah Oh really

Anna and Spencer are both shouting now Anna POINTS AT
DAVID who is standing by the table holding silverware

ANNA (CONTD)
What about him Everyone’s best friend
there What do you know about him

Spencer opens his mouth confused

ANNA (CONTD)
I called the military base he said he was
from and they said he was dead

(MORE)
ANNA (CONTD)
Then they sent me a photo of him that
wasn’t him What do you think of that

Spencer looks towards David hesitantly Laura and Luke
both look confused David laughs

DAVID
Military intelligence for you

ANNA
Oh yeah
(to Spencer)
Ask him to show you his ID He’s not
David Collins We don’t know who he is

Spencer again looks to David

DAVID
I was part of a special forces unit when
I was injured so they should be
providing a cover story to any civilians
who ask about me That’s a good thing
But I did get my dog tags back They’re
right here

David sets down the forks in his hand He reaches into
his pants pocket and hands a pair of METAL DOG TAGS to
Spencer who looks at them They bear the name “COLLINS
DAVID ANDERSEN”

DAVID (CONTD)
I don’t like to wear them because I
don’t know I like having them with me
though As for my ID I don’t have a
current license but I’ve got my
documents in my bag Should I go

David gestures towards Caleb’s room Spencer shakes his
head

SPENCER
That won’t be necessary Anna I think
you owe David an apology

ANNA
No fucking way

SPENCER
You watch your mouth young lady

Spencer stops and takes a breath

SPENCER (CONTD)
I am very sorry about your friend Craig
But as for Zeke Hastings and his crew I
have it on good authority that they’re a
bunch of pot dealers You know why they
arrested Zeke for the murder Because he
probably did it Anna

ANNA
Fuck you

Anna turns and storms back down the hallway to her room
passing Luke Spencer and Laura stand for a moment
looking after her then Spencer turns to David

SPENCER
David I am very sorry about that

DAVID
It’s okay She’s upset I probably should

Anna taps one of the numbers then scrolls through her
contacts bringing up “CRAIG” Craig’s number matches the
last number that called David’s phone

Boddington Except he’s not a doctor
anymore He got his license taken away
two years ago when he performed a face
lift on this lady while he was drunk

Luke hands Anna’s phone back to her

LUKE
So David knows the guy Maybe it’s his
uncle or something

ANNA
That’s what I want to find out

LUKE
So what do you need me to do

ANNA
I need to talk to the police The cops
found those drugs in Zeke’s room and
assume they’ve got their guy The
investigation’s closed Zeke’s lawyer is
telling him to take a plea

Luke looks mildly suspicious

LUKE
Yeah

ANNA
To get them to reopen it I need all the
information I can get You remember how
you stole a password for that database to
do research on your paper last year

LUKE
Yeah I got in trouble when I told dad
about it

ANNA
Well do something like that again Find
out anything you can about this guy

Luke looks pensive

LUKE
Do you really think David killed Craig
and that other guy

Anna steers the car down the country road

ANNA
Yeah I do

LUKE
Okay I’ll see if I can find anything A
lot of arrest reports are public record
I’ll check those first

find anything

Luke nods

INT HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Luke walks into a full classroom He moves down an aisle
in between the rows of desks his head lowered

Luke sits at an empty desk and immediately takes out his
netbook opening it to an internet browser

JASON is seated behind Luke He has a BANDAGE over his
NOSE and his face is BRUISED Jason regards Luke
balefully then reaches and POKES LUKE WITH HIS PENCIL
Luke exhales but says nothing

JASON
Hey faggot

Luke does not respond typing into his netbook Jason
takes out a pencil sharpener and begins meticulously
SHARPENING his pencil

Jason looks over Luke’s shoulder Luke’s browser window
is open to a news story The headline reads “DISGRACED
PLASTIC SURGEON TO PAY 2 MILLION IN DAMAGES”

Jason jabs Luke in the back with the sharpened pencil
JASON (CONT’D)
Hey what’s that You looking for someone
to do your sex change operation

Luke turns around and PUNCHES JASON IN HIS FACE The
punch is quick but largely ineffective

The classroom explodes with surprise several students
standing to look Jason startled reels back in his
seat Then he flushes with rage and stands up

JASON (CONTD)
You little bitch-

Jason grabs Luke with one hand PULLING HIM UP OUT OF HIS
SEAT and PUNCHES HIM with the other

Luke staggers back falling to land right near a
chalkboard at the back of the room There is a wooden
YARDSTICK leaning against the wall next to him

Jason touches his bruised face where Luke hit him then
furiously strides forward

The YARDSTICK swung by Luke catches Jason across the
MIDDLE OF HIS FACE It breaks in half splinters flying
everywhere

Jason STUMBLES BACK holding his injured face He YELLS
with pain

Luke stands at the back of the classroom holding the

remains of the shattered yardstick catching his breath
He smiles slightly

INT HIGH SCHOOL - SECRETARY’S OFFICE - DAY - LATER
Luke sits in an outside waiting area adjoining the school
principal’s office A disapproving SECRETARY glares at

him from across her desk Luke stares at the floor

The door opens and Laura enters with David Laura
immediately crosses to Luke David follows

LAURA

Luke nods

LUKE
I’m fine

The secretary addresses Laura

SECRETARY
Mrs Peterson

LAURA
Yes that’s right

SECRETARY

Laura looks at David

DAVID

David kneels down in front of Luke

DAVID (CONTD)

LUKE
This kid called me a faggot so I broke a
yardstick on his face

DAVID
Okay Did you hurt him

Luke uncomfortably shrugs David smiles

I’1l go in with you

David and Laura enter the principal’s office

INT HIGH SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Mr Alston addresses Laura and David Laura looks
extremely upset David appears calm

MR ALSTON
Due to our school’s zero tolerance policy
on violence I’m afraid we have no choice
but to expel your son That’s pending the
decision of the board but I’m afraid
it’s fairly certain

LAURA
But
MR ALSTON
I’m sorry

DAVID
What did the kid call him

Mr Alston pauses

MR ALSTON
What

DAVID
The kid you know what’s-his-name that
Luke hit in the face What did he call
Luke

MR ALSTON
I don’t-

DAVID
Did he call him a faggot

Mr Alston looks uncomfortable

MR ALSTON
I believe that’s what was said yes But
that’s no excuse-

DAVID
So that makes it a hate crime

Mr Alston is silent for a moment

MR ALSTON
What

DAVID
A hate crime And I’d like to know how
many others have been perpetrated against
her son under your watch A gay student
targeted with physical violence finally
defends himself and you’re what
Suspending him

MR ALSTON
(hesitates)
We could consider suspension

DAVID
No You couldn’t I’1ll be interested to
see what the board thinks of you when
this is front of the entire country Not
to mention our lawyers

(MORE )
DAVID (CONTD)
(to Laura)
Do you want to sue them

Laura is totally frozen

LAURA
I I don’t

DAVID
(to Mr Alston)
We’re suing you and the school board

David rises to his feet pulling Laura with him Mr
Alston addresses them desperately

MR ALSTON
I didn’t even know he was gay

David just shakes his head moving towards the door

MR ALSTON (CONTD)
What about after school detention

David stops moving

DAVID
For how long

MR ALSTON
A month

David considers then nods

DAVID
That seems fair

MR ALSTON
After school detention We’1ll put him to
work helping the prom committee set up
for the fall dance

DAVID
We’ll agree to that But I do not want to
hear anything further about this young
man being harassed We understand each
other

MR ALSTON
I think we do Mister Who are you

DAVID
I’m a friend of the family Good day

David exits pulling Laura with him out of the
principal’s office
INT HIGH SCHOOL - SECRETARY’S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

David and Laura walk up to Luke who is still seated
miserably in the secretary’s office David points at him

DAVID
After school detention for a month

LUKE
That’s it

DAVID
Yeah

David holds out his palm Luke hesitates then slaps it
David turns the slap into a quick fist bump

DAVID (CONTD)
See you later

As David turns to leave Luke suddenly rises to his feet

LUKE
David Can I talk to you for a second

DAVID
Okay

Luke glances over at Laura who still looks somewhat
dazed David turns to Laura

DAVID (CONTD)
I’m going to step out into the hall with
Luke for a moment if that’s okay

LAURA
Oh Certainly

David and Luke exit the secretary’s office out into the
hall Laura sits down in the seat Luke just vacated The
secretary glares at her Laura does not notice

INT HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

David and Luke speak quietly leaning up against a row of
lockers in the deserted hallway

LUKE
So she thinks you killed Craig And
she’s trying to make a case to the
police so they’1l1 let her boyfriend go

DAVID
Anna told you all this

LUKE
Yeah

David smiles as if mildly amused

DAVID
Do you think I killed Craig

LUKE
(shrugs)
I don’t care But that’s why she wanted
me to check out that plastic surgeon in
Florida She wanted to know what the
connection was there

DAVID
Yeah why would I need a plastic surgeon

LUKE
To change your appearance Like the
bones in your face And maybe scar up
your fingers so you don’t have prints

David stops smiling

LUKE (CONTD)
I mean at least that’s what I figured I
know you’re not really David Collins I
looked him up right after Anna said that
So maybe you don’t want people to know
who you are A surgeon who would do that
sort of thing is probably pretty rare I
mean there’s probably rules against it
But that doctor well I guess he needs
the money so he’d do that kind of work

DAVID
That’s an interesting theory

LUKE
I’m not going to tell anyone about it
And no one will believe Anna She doesn’t
have anything against you You killed
dad’s boss too right

David says nothing regarding Luke curiously
I don’t care

Why not

Because we’re

DAVID

Major Carver hangs up his cell phone

ANNA
What

MAJOR CARVER
We’re going to the Maplewood Barn to get
your brother The police couldn’t send a
car there They’ve got their hands full

ANNA
You need to tell me what’s going on Who
are you You came here for David

Major Carver hesitates then answers

MAJOR CARVER
Yes The soldier you know as David was
one of the subjects of a medical
experiment His spine was damaged in
combat and even after surgery he was in
pain He volunteered for a procedure that
would turn off his pain receptors and
allow him to consciously regulate the
flow of adrenaline in his body

ANNA
Okay

MAJOR CARVER
The idea being that if we could get
soldiers to control their fear responses
push their adrenaline when they needed
it we’d lose less men But it changed
our subject While we had him under
study he killed several people and
escaped He burned their bodies so it
would confuse us we thought he’d died in
the fire initially By the time we
figured out what he’d done the trail was
cold

ANNA
Maybe you should have tested your
procedure on a subject who wasn’t a
psychopath

The Major sighs

MAJOR CARVER
By all accounts he was an ideal soldier
well liked by everyone He was chosen in
part for his empathy levels I don’t
know If you didn’t have to feel guilt or
sadness would you choose to

(MORE )

dance floor Nothing else can be heard

LUKE
Anna it’s just David I don’t know
what’s going on but he wouldn’t hurt us

ANNA
I need you to trust me Luke Come on
And be quiet
Anna pulls Luke forward down the corridor
INT MAPLEWOOD BARN - ENTRY MAZE - WOODEN HALLWAY -
CONTINUOUS

Anna and Luke silently enter the wooden hallways near the
front of the maze

Almost immediately there is a SCREAM and the wooden door
RATTLES out at them Anna and Luke flinch away

INT MAPLEWOOD BARN - DANCE FLOOR - EVENING - CONTINUOUS
Walking across the foggy dance floor David hears the

electronic SCREAM from the black maze He smiles
slightly walking forward holding the bloody box cutter

INT MAPLEWOOD BARN - ENTRY MAZE - WOODEN HALLWAY -
CONTINUOUS

Anna pulls Luke down the dark corridor deeper into the
maze She whispers

ANNA
Come on

Anna turns right at the end of the corridor in the
opposite direction of the path she took earlier She and
Luke round another corner disappearing from view

The next moment David appears turning into the corridor
they just vacated He looks around listens then turns
towards the front entrance moving quietly

INT MAPLEWOOD BARN - ENTRY MAZE - JUNKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Anna and Luke hurry deeper into the maze rounding
another corner

Luke and Anna find themselves in a CHAMBER in the maze
filled with barrels and debris designed like a JUNKYARD

There is a stack of barrels in one corner that appears
designed for a maze employee to hide behind in order to
jump out and scare people A GORE-STREAKED dummy is
propped in front of the barrels

Anna quickly pulls Luke towards the stack of barrels

ANNA
I need you to hide in here Okay

Luke looks at the hiding space then shakes his head

LUKE
What No way Look Anna David was
probably just after that army guy Let’s
just Let’s go talk to him

ANNA
Luke He killed mom and dad They’re
gone

Luke blinks He smiles hesitantly

LUKE
No he didn’t You’re just saying that

Luke looks at Anna She stares back at him with tears in
her eyes Luke stops smiling

LUKE (CONT’D)
I What Mom and dad are

Anna puts both her hands on Luke’s shoulders

ANNA
Please Just hide here okay I’m going
to lead him away Don’t come out unless
you hear me or the police Okay

Luke hesitates then nods staring as if dazed He steps
back behind the stack of barrels disappearing from view

Anna quickly shifts one of the barrels further hiding
Luke

ANNA (CONTD)
(whispering)
Ill come back for you

Anna turns and runs deeper into the dark maze

Anna turns a corner then another She finds herself
facing a DEAD END

Hurriedly Anna backtracks to her last turn going the
other direction disappearing from view

On the other side of the maze wall from Anna David walks
deeper into the maze turning corners still holding the
BLOODY BOX CUTTER in front of him David speaks LOUDLY

DAVID
I’m really sorry about this guys

David turns another corner A scarecrow leans against one
wall of this corridor David ignores it calling out

DAVID (CONTD)
I tried to think of another way to do it
Any other solution

Hidden behind the barrels Luke goes quiet Davids
FOOTSTEPS are audible near him FAKE LIGHTNING FLASHES
from a source overhead

Moving carefully Luke peers out between the barrels As
Luke watches David steps into the chamber looking
around David moves forward holding the BOX CUTTER

David slowly WALKS PAST LUKE’s hiding place SCRAPING the
BLADE against a chain link fence that lines the corridor
He continues speaking as he MOVES AWAY

DAVID (CONTD)
Are you guys hiding There’s no point I
locked the back door I have to find you

Luke goes completely still as David passes him barely
breathing He watches as David moves away from him
nearing the chamber’s exit

David comes to a stop at the chamber’s exit He looks
around then goes perfectly still listening

Luke silently reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
BUTTERFLY KNIFE David gave him Luke holds it in one
trembling hand closed his fingers ready to open it

DAVID (CONTD)
Come on Where are you
(pause)
Luke Come on out buddy I’m not going
to hurt you

Inside the hiding space Luke shifts his weight slightly
clutching the knife

David SPINS AROUND STARING at Luke’s hiding space

To Luke it appears as if David is staring directly at
him but from David’s perspective he can only see the
barrels and the dummy David’s eyes narrow peering at
the hiding space

Luke holds his breath His hands shake slightly

David takes a step forward towards the stack of barrels
He holds the box cutter out in front of him

A CRASHING sound comes from the other side of the barn
that of a MIRROR SHATTERING

David MOVES with unnatural speed immediately SPINNING
and running back out of the chamber towards the maze’s
dance floor exit

As soon as David is gone Luke EXHALES gasping

INT MAPLEWOOD BARN - DANCE FLOOR - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

David RUNS out of the dark maze racing across the dance
floor towards the mirror maze

Thick pale fog shifts across the dance floor moved by
Davids speed

As David exits the dance floor the song on the CD that
is playing ENDS segueing to another GOTH SONG

INT MAPLEWOOD BARN - EXIT MAZE - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

David runs into the mirror maze FOG FLOWING IN after
him He comes to a stop at its entrance standing by
Major Carvers corpse

Looking around David can only see his reflections
looking back at him refracted by the broken glass of one
of the mirrors in the corridor

David looks down and with his foot shifts around the
FOG that covers the floor revealing the pool of blood
that surrounds Major Carver

Major Carver’s GUN IS MISSING David smiles slightly

DAVID
Hmm

As the fog shifts back David’s eyes narrow He kicks at
the fog again It parts revealing the corridor floor

BLOODY FOOTPRINTS from Anna’s sneakers lead away from
Major Carvers body back towards the dance floor

David smiles Crouching slightly the box cutter in front
of him David moves silently shifting the fog in front
of him with his feet following the bloody footsteps

David stops at the dance floor entrance looking around
The fog is thick covering the dance floor illuminated
in swirling spots by the spinning mirror ball

David kicks at the fog in front of him It parts
revealing ANNA’S SNEAKERS which rest on the dance floor
directly in front of David

David looks up Anna is STANDING BEHIND HIM in the
mirrored corridor aiming Major Carvers pistol at his
back Her feet are BARE

ANNA
You killed my parents

David blinks shifting his weight almost imperceptibly

DAVID
I did yes

In a sudden movement David SPINS AROUND ANNA FIRES

The bullet catches David IN THE CHEST knocking him back
onto the dance floor

INT MAPLEWOOD BARN - DANCE FLOOR - EVENING - CONTINUOUS

The fog parts as David falls heavily to the floor He
does not move

Anna steps from the mirror maze the gun in her hand
aimed down at David The fog shifts back in OBSCURING
DAVID from view

Anna hesitates then steps forward WAVING her free hand
in front of her WAFTING the fog from her path

David is NO LONGER ON THE FLOOR in front of her
Anna spins around and is STABBED IN THE LEG with the box

cutter BLADE It tears into her flesh through her tights
She falls to the floor YELLING in pain

David is crouched in the fog the front of his shirt
soaked with his BLOOD He grins at Anna his teeth
bloody then LUNGES FORWARD at her

Anna AIMS THE PISTOL at David David KNOCKS IT ASIDE
gripping Anna’s wrist as she FIRES

The bullet hits the GRIM REAPER dummy in the corner of
the room knocking it over It falls forward onto a bale
of HAY Its LANTERN sends FLAMES out onto the hay

David WRENCHES the pistol from Anna’s grasp It goes
skittering across the floor disappearing into the fog

David reaches out and GRABS Anna’s NECK with both hands
He tightens his grip CHOKING HER They struggle both of
them crouched in the fog on the dance floor MUSIC
BLARING

Anna CLAWS at David’s hands as he compresses the arteries
in her neck She struggles going to her knees
frantically trying to pull back his fingers

David exhales with exertion Behind him the bale of HAY
is STARTING TO BURN the flames filling the fog around
them with FLICKERING LIGHT that illuminates David’s face

DAVID
Stop it It’ll be over in just a second
Anna stares up at David her eyes glassy from lack of
oxygen She continues to try to pull away his fingers
but without strength pawing desperately at his hands

David regards Anna calmly continuing to strangle her
Anna’s hands drop to her sides Her head slumps forward

A KNIFE BLADE STABS into David’s back then is WRENCHED
BACK OUT

David turns around releasing Anna who falls to the
dance floor COUGHING and sucking in air

LUKE is standing directly in front of David holding the
BLOODY butterfly knife in his hand He stares at David
tearfully shaking

David coughs BLOOD flecking his lips He holds out his
hands

DAVID (CONTD)
Hey Luke-

Luke STEPS FORWARD AND STABS DAVID in the chest

David stumbles back the knife sticking out from his
chest He hits the wall near the fog machine and slides
down it smearing it with blood

David sprawls on the floor his back to the wall blood
flowing from his multiple wounds He swallows looking
down at the knife in his chest then looks up at Luke
his eyes half open

DAVID (CONT’D)
Hey

Luke stares at David
DAVID (CONTD)
You did You did the right thing I
don’t blame you Don’t feel bad

David smiles slightly at Luke then looks over at Anna
who is still crouched on the floor

David opens his bloody mouth as if trying to say
something to Anna then his eyes close

David exhales and GOES STILL
Luke stares at David then quickly reaches down to help

Anna to her feet The FLAMES are building behind them
igniting a curtain covering the wall

Anna leans against Luke When she speaks her voice is
raspy

ANNA
Thank you

LUKE
Are you okay

ANNA

Yeah Are you

Luke nods Anna regards Luke for a moment then they make
their way towards the dark maze leading to the front
entrance Behind them the flames have ENGULFED the far
wall and the fire is BUILDING steadily

Luke supports Anna as she limps slightly her arm across
his shoulders

FADE TO

EXT MAPLEWOOD BARN - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

Anna and Luke stand near the back of an ambulance in the
parking lot for the barn Anna still has her arm across
Luke’s shoulders

Behind them the fire in the building appears to have
been extinguished SMOKE RISING from the building’s burnt
portions FIREMEN carry equipment to their trucks The
large parking lot is filled with black SUVs and police
cars with LIGHTS FLASHING

At the back of the ambulance a PARAMEDIC shines a light
into Anna’s eyes then glances over at Luke

PARAMEDIC
You sure you’re both feeling okay

LUKE
Yeah We’re fine

A volunteer FIREFIGHTER runs up to the paramedic
FIREMAN
Hey they could use you inside There’s

bodies in there

The paramedic nods quickly turning away from Anna and
Luke He jogs over towards the building with the fireman
EXT MAPLEWOOD BARN - REAR ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

The paramedic and fireman move to join a group of
emergency workers waiting outside the rear entrance to
the barn

Firefighters in full protection gear including hoods and
breathing masks are moving in and out of the building
The sound of fire deterrent foam SPRAYING is audible
within Smoke billows out from the door

The paramedic looks to the volunteer firefighter

PARAMEDIC
What’s the deal

FIREMAN
Guess there’s two bodies in there both
of them burned up pretty bad One of the
guys said their teeth are missing got
knocked out so I don’t know what the
deal is Soon as they give us the clear
we go in

The paramedic nods watching masked men in full body
protection gear exit the building

EXT HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

At the rear of the ambulance Luke leans over and rests
his head on Anna’s shoulder Anna puts her arm around
him She looks around surveying the activity around the
smoldering building

As Anna watches one of the masked fireman emerges from
behind the building He turns his head around in all
directions then looks over at Anna

Anna notices the masked fireman watching her She blinks
tired then turns away staring out into the distance at
the dark night sky Next to her Luke closes his eyes

The masked fireman watches Anna and Luke for another

moment then turns and LIMPS AWAY disappearing into the
darkness of the field behind the building

FADE OUT
