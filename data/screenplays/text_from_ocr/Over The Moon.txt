SEQUENCE 0100 - SPACE DOG

FADE UP ON BLACK
Billions of glistening stars

MOTHER (0S)
Scientists can tell us many things
about space They can tell us how
far away the stars are They can
tell us that space starts one
hundred kilometers above the Earth

FORMING OUT OF THE STARS - An impossibly huge object lumbers
past too close for us to see it in its entirety Is it a
spacecraft A meteor No - it seems to have FUR

MOTHER (0S) (CONT’D)
But they can’t tell us about the
Space Dog

SPACE DOG
BARKING EFFORTS GRUMBLES

MOTHER (0S)
He likes to chase comets and roll
in the star dust

Enormous PAWS paddle through the blackness A gargantuan pink
TONGUE flaps in slow motion

The SPACE DOG heads for the FULL MOON His epic jaws open
wide in a state of happy doggie delirium

MOTHER (0S) (CONT’D)
As far as the Space Dog’s
concerned the Moon is just a big
tempting ball And almost every
night he takes a bite

SPACE DOG
CHOMPING EFFORT

The gargantuan Space Dog bites the Moon getting part of it
into his mouth CHOMP

WIDER FROM SPACE - it looks like the Moon WANES

SEQUENCE 0200 - LEGEND OF CHANG’E

A giant foot enters screen and taps the water next to where
the moon is reflected

EXT CANALWUZHEN WATER TOWNCHINA - EVENING - THAT MOMENT

The foot belongs to Fei Fei 5 who contemplates this
information from the comfort of her mother’s lap

MOTHER
And that’s the real reason the moon
has phases

Mother brushes Young Fei Fei’s LONG HAIR as they gaze up at
the waning moon FATHER shares their picnic blanket They’re
a beautiful family serene and complete

YOUNG FEI FEI
So when the Moon is big and round
that’s when the Space Dog doesn’t
take a bite

MOTHER
That’s when the Moon Goddess
Chang’e makes him spit it out

MOTHER holds the Chang’e doll up next to Fei Fei

MOTHER (CONTD)
BLAH

MOTHER pretends to spit out the moon Both Young Fei Fei and
Mother LAUGH and SNORT

FATHER

LAUGHS All right does anyone
want to hear the scientific
explanation

YOUNG FEI FEI
Sorry baba I like the Mommy
explanation best

MOTHER
(teasing to Dad)
Outnumbered

YOUNG FEI FEI
Tell me about Chang’e

FATHER
Again

YOUNG FEI FEI
Again again I love to hear about
the moon goddess Tell me momma

MOTHER unties a SCARF from around her neck that has an image
of the Moon Goddess Chang’e on it Mother holds the scarf
in front of FEI FEI using it as a prop as she sings

(Transition to a 2D animated style)

The story unravels on the scarf’s surface - the Chinese
mythology of Chang’e and Houyi

SONG - ON THE MOON ABOVE

MOTHER
LONG AGO - AN ANCIENT STORY
BEAUTIFUL AND KIND CHANG’E
AND A HANDSOME MAN NAMED HOUYI
WERE IN LOVE--

YOUNG FEI FEI
True love

MOTHER
TRUE LOVE
BUT SHE TOOK A MAGIC POTION
GIVING IMMORTALITY
THEN SHE FLOATED
LEAVING HER TRUE LOVE
AND SHE WAITS FOR HIM
ON THE MOON ABOVE-

(Transition back to CG animation)

Young FEI FEI tugs her Mother’s scarf down in front of her to
reveal the waning moon

MOTHER (CONTD)
And that’s where she lives now - on
the Moon with only Jade Rabbit to
keep her company

YOUNG FEI FEI
Why

MOTHER
Because Houyi died here on Earth

YOUNG FEI FEI
And when she cries her tears turn
into stardust

MOTHER
LONGING HOPING
FOR HER ONE TRUE LOVE
NOW SHE WAITS FOR HIM
ON THE MOON ABOVE

GOBI
Wait a minute - why does this look
familiar

Gobi holds the metal piece up for inspection It lines up
with a SYMBOL adorning a building across the street the same
symbol that’s all over Lunaria

GOBI
Nope - never seen it

Fei Fei takes the metal bit in her hand and also holds it up
against the symbol on the building across the street The
FORCED PERSPECTIVE shows that the half-piece of metal forms a
WHOLE with the symbol

This half forms a whole with that
symbol

Their jaws drop open They stare at the metal piece They
stare at each other Gobi starts glowing from the inside

Giant cranes glide in formation low over the canal

A HUGE FULL MOON is still faintly visible in light of dawn
Fei Fei takes off her mother’s scarf and looks at Chang’e-
She holds on to the scarf in a tight embrace Behind her - a
great flapping of WINGS Fei Fei looks up A Giant Crane
lands on the post at the edge of the dock She ruffles her
feathers and looks at Fei Fei with kind eyes

Fei Fei sits up For a moment they just gaze at each other
The bird cocks her head in the friendliest way Fei Fei cocks
her head back mirroring the crane with a SOFT LAUGH A
smile spreads across her face Fei Fei ties her scarf around
her neck as the crane takes off rustling Fei Fei’s hair She
GIGGLES then stands basking in the moonlight in this
quiet moment to herself

Suddenly a ping-pong ball bounces off her head
