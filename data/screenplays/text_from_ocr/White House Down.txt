INT HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING 1

Stare at my broken face in a gilded mirror The breaks
occurred a lifetime ago healed uneven I wear a white
tropical button-down a Republican-gold Rolex a pirate-patch
over what was my left eye

ME (VO)
I’m old And all I have left is the
will to remember

I reach into a dresser drawer pull out a yellowed black and
white picture of HER this beatific blonde sleeping Below
me is a week-old LA Times with the headline Matriarch of
Television Series Empire Ridge Retires

The Matriarch’s picture in the middle

ME (VO) (CONTD)
-and the fear I’1ll forget

Slide HER over the Matriarch’s picture the Matriarch 30
years younger now Lift my eyes back to my reflection

ME (VO) (CONTD)
I killed innocent men I betrayed
sacred oaths I reaped profit from
horror The names are dead or too
guilty to tell The events so
brutal they beg to be re-told

What were you gonna tell Welles
Noonan

(watch as he flinches)
He has a subpoena with your name on
it Sanderline Why would someone
like you need to talk to the US
Attorney

Sanderline staying silent

ME (CONTD)

about to talk to the US-

SANDERLINE JOHNSON
-but they don’t know

Have him look out the window Klein
Click A breath Drop the phone on the cradlestep to the
windowopen itthen I chuckle genuine

ME
Sanderline you gotta see this

Trusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window

SANDERLINE JOHNSON
What’m I-

-smash his head against the frame using his forward motion
He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to
pitch his legs up and out My face a quick-change evil mask

Feature Sanderline’s nine-story fall That Ambassador Hotel
robe billows behind him like a cape He detonates an overhead
streetlight with a bomb sound then hits the driveway

Unzip my fly hustle into the bathroom screams from outside
now Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the
door Step out play it baffled look at the bed where
Sanderline sat then the open window screams floating up

ME
DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP

Lunge to the window Sanderline post-mortem Head shattered
Valets sprinting Junior on the phone Ruiz steps-up next to

INT POLICE HEADQUARTERS - BRADLEYS OFFICE - MORNING 6

Spartan space appointed with high-ticket items like the
mahogany table around which we sit Outside echoes of a
protest filter through the windows

MUFFLED PROTEST AMALGAM (0C)
MEXICAN BROTHERS SI IMPERIAL
DODGERS NO

Four of us at the table glued to the TV watching US
Attorney Welles Noonan lambasting the LAPD

ME (VO)
LA’s version of the Young Turks
only meaner

(MORE)
ME (VO) (contd)
Boyce Bradley Chief of Detectives
Smartest man in town And one of
the richest Dad was a Real Estate
Developer who owned a strip of land
that’s now known as the Santa
Monica Freeway On either side
Bradley’s book-ends DA Bob
Gallaudet not the smartest man in
town ‘Gas Chamber’ Bob cribbed my
notes at USC Law And Tom Bethune
running for a City Council seat
thatll decide if this Mexican slum
called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed
and renamed ‘Dodger Stadium’

BRADLEY
Turn it off

Bethune leaps like a lapdog hits the power

ME
I was pissing He was jumping

Bradley picks up a newspaper

BRADLEY
‘US Attorney Noonan is accusing the
Los Angeles Police Department in
general and Lt David Klein in
particular of murder at worst
gross incompetence at best’

ME
Noonan had Sanderline scared After
he sang to me he panicked and jumped

TOM BETHUNE
He did spend a month in Camarillo
Mental Hospital last year-

GAS CHAMBER BOB
-and wearing that hotel robe over
his clothes makes him look even
more looney-bin

TOM BETHUNE
Plus Reuben Ruiz recanted So
Noonan’s Boxing Probe is dead He’s
got nothing-

BRADLEY
-but time a mandate and new
targetsI need to speak to the
Lieutenant alone

Bob and Tom nod pat my back on the way out proud uncles
lending support before Dad drops the hammer Door closes I
stand step to the window big Pro-Mex protest below Geeks
and placards ‘BASEBALL IS AS AMERICAN AS THE TRAIL OF TEARS

BRADLEY (CONT’D)
Describe to me your duty as you
understood it regarding Sanderline
Johnson and Reuben Ruiz

ME
Take both men into custody before
Noonan and the Feds could and find
out what they were going to tell-

BRADLEY
-and why did I choose you for this

ME
Because I’m a Cop with a law
degree and you thought my legal-

BRADLEY

-because your a thug with a law
degree Because I thought by now
youd be so indebted to this
Department for not indicting andor
imprisoning you that diligent
honest discharge of duty would be
assured

(beat)
And I made a horrible misjudgment

ME
Bethune and Gallaudet don’t think
so

BRADLEY

Bob’s happy because he wants to be
State Attorney General and his most
likely opponent will be Welles
Noonan Tom’s happy because Morton
Diskant who’s leading their City
Council race is endorsed by
Noonan Thus they’re not seeing
the larger play

(with calculated emphasis)
Noonan’s new target will likely be
the LAPD itself

ME
How do you know that

BRADLEY

Because that’s where I would aim a
subpoenaed Federal witness plummets
to his death in the company of two
LAPD detectives

(beat)
This screams Police Corruption
This offers Noonan the possibility
of payback in the form of national
headlines

I wave it all off

ME
Johnson did that stint at the Nut
House -- leak his file to your

friends at the times-—

-and Bradley drops his bomb Coroner’s file I stareguess
the contentstry to keep my heart rate in-check

BRADLEY
My friends would be more interested
in this

(beat flipping file open)
Coroners preliminary white paint
chips found embedded in Sanderline
Johnsons scalp A matching dent on
the white window sill I checked
with the hotel switchboard and
found a call was patched to your
room at about the same time Johnson
flew out of it

(beat proclamation )
It shocks and sickens me that your
allegiance to the Chicago mob would
take precedence over the LAPD

ME
(fuck drawing this out)
Alright Where’s this going
(pull my badge table it)
Gun Shield What

BRADLEY
The appearance of disciplinary
measures taken against you are
mandated post-Sanderline Johnson
so your suspension will be recorded
but sealedand kept quiet for now-

ME
So if the papers or Noonan come
sniffing around-

BRADLEY
-we can provide adequate proof of
your dismissal

ME
But you’re not dismissing me

BRADLEY
Just on paper
(closes the file)
Since I misjudged the Cop I thought
you were I’m going to leverage the
Cop that you are

Bradley slides the morning paper over Front page ‘Candidate
Diskant Hears The Hue and Cry of The Underclass’ The photo
shows a smiling Diskant rolled shirt-sleeves in the middle
of a sea of LA Immigrants all smiling back

BRADLEY (CONTD)
Morton Diskant is to be removed
from the City Council race The
means and methods implemented to
that end I will entrust to you

ME
(throw a thumb at Bethune)
You want me to torpedo Diskant so
your buddy Bethune can win a City
Council seat uncontested-

BRADLEY
-or spend the next month in lock-up
before being arraigned on charges
of gross misconduct and dereliction
of duty The preamble before you
face life in prison for murder

I stare back Feel myself getting fitted for strings

BRADLEY (CONTD)
Diskant works Saturdays Late

Bradley waves me out I intentionally drag my badge back
across the desk scratching his Mahogany heirloom

rat his competition and kill the
ones we couldn’t convict

Reminds me of another pain in the

I’m puzzled as to why the Bradley
would assign you to the Magdalena
case when you’re neither Homicide

There’s no body and nothing was
taken except Hector

KOENIG
He does know how to delegate
doesn’t heand also I’m sure that
poor Negro’s nosedive has put you
squarely in his debt

and he’s got a war chest to keep

Yeah Hector’s disappearance is
definitely an inside job That
whole family feels hinky The
daughter was all bruises and no

looks part punching bag

Parked Tepid pulls off the stolen mug Done Toss it to the
passenger side lands on a bed of crumpled Styrofoam Look
up the Magdalena residence looms a few doors down Glance at
the passenger seat an envelope lined with fifty 100 bills
The name BLEDSOE written across the front Pick it up

ME (VO)
Thinking I could tip Milteer off to
the kidnap plot and pick up the
other half of my payment

(stare at that money)
Thinking I should just give the
first half back now’cuz I know
right now Ill never hurt her

Toss the envelope into the glove-box slam it shut Scan Two
heads in one of the unmarked patrol cars I ordered Cursory
nods as they pass Tail-lights fade Dead quiet save my low
Jazz Fighting my drift Check my Hamilton 1000 Grimace

ME (VO) (CONTD)
No sense of time Exhaustion steals
it A full hour earlier than I told
Junior to meet me I need sleep

Yawn Look upLucille Magdalena at her window Sudden
Startling no blouse pig-tails big silver-dollar nipples
touchsteam glass Pushes the curtains back even further
Adrenaline cuts through the lactic acid wide awake now

I see her eyes aren’t sex-placid or rolled back -- they’re
scanning -- hopeful to glimpse someone outside looking back

ME (VO) (CONTD)
This routine had been done before
That old broad babbling about a
Peeper The only other link to
Hector Magdalena’s disappearance

She holds her scan for a blink a different smile eyes sex-
placid now rolled-back now -- she just saw what she was
looking for hidden eyes staring back at her I look to where
I saw her gaze kinkunholster my 45 Get out quiet

EXT 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 36

Cold for LA Walkingscanning 45 flush against my leg
Sticking to shadows Cross the street two homes down Quiet
steps Closer a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter

Glance back up at the window Lucille gone -- a forearm
shiver flashes from nowhere bluntsblasts the back of my
head Nose-first into asphalt Too angry to black out Spit
blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning

ME
STOP-

Still unsure what hit me Pick-up my gun clear my nose of
gouting blood stand weave a figure in black sprinting
away PEEPER Wipe away impact-tears aim realize my trigger
finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly Tuck the gun use my
left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim

POP-POP-POP The Peeper pitches Visible in the streetlight
a red puff off his right shoulder Headlights at end of the
block behind me come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8

Peeper fighting for balance keeps running

I sprint heedless round the corner follow a blood-trail
panting bleeding my own trail Lift my eyes to see the
Peeper shoulder through a fence vanish into a backyard
Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus I cross the street-

-those headlights swerve hard in front of me Black Buick I
look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel
I bounce off like someone yanked a leash Crumble-yell Hands
pick me up I fight back before I even see at whom I’m
swinging square-jawed types eyes hidden by Bureau derbies

Welles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick
Punches me as hard as he can without provocation nothing to
write home about My gun clatters to the ground

WELLES NOONAN
That’s for Sanderline Johnson

ME
(nod at the Peeper trail)
ARE YOU BLIND-

WELLES NOONAN
-what were you firing at

ME
The only lead on Magdalena -- we’re
after the same guy you idiot

WELLES NOONAN
(to one of the goons)
-write that name down ‘Magda-LEE-
na’ or ‘Magda-LAY-na’
(back to me)
No we were after you But thanks
for the name

Sag under the weight of my own insomnia-fed stupidity

ME (VO)

Assumed the Feds were smart
Assumed they were ready to stick a
new probe into the LAPD’s deal with
Hector like Bradley warned like
everyone feared But they had no
clue and I just handed them the
whole God damn thing

(beat)
Like I said I need sleep

Raise my face now eyes intent chin out

ME (CONT’D)
First punch you ever thrown Noonan
Your Mom have to teach you how
because Dad was the same no-chin
Connecticut Faggot you are

Noonan stops turns back to me blazing

ME (VO) (CONTD)
I think I hit the Noonan family
dynamic dead-on

He winds up an overhand right a big-bright flash then
darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn

FLUTTERING BLACK

WELLES NOONAN (0C)
Drop him

DERBY 1 (0C)
You don’t want to take him in

WELLES NOONAN (0C)
I only want to bring him in when I
know he’1l never leave

BLACK dissolves to something LIGHTER then

INT INTERROGATION ROOM - TIME UNKNOWN 37

side space for the cot I’m on Look up Junior looking
down ‘Concerned’ isn’t strong enough In his undershirt He
slips the red steno pad into his back pocket Sit up A
balled dress shirt in my hand blood sopped

Gaze at my Hamilton face cracked ‘5l6am’-- Fritz Koenig
walks in silver pitcher in hand I gape up still punchy

Coffee

KOENIG
Ice Bradley’s on his way down

Toss the dress shirt to the floor

JUNIOR STEMMONS
That’s mineyou needed some
mopping up

ME
Who found me

JUNIOR STEMMONS
I did I got there at eleven like
you said right as two black and
white’s pulled up you were out
cold in a gutter ‘round the block
(this blithe little grin)
Did Noonan knock you out

ME
He hit me with his car first

JUNIOR STEMMONS
(a nod to Koenig)
The Captain was the only one here
at this hour

Look from Junior and Koenig to the window behind him --
Bradley steam-rolling our way To Koenig conspiratorial

KLEIN
If I need your help later on can I
count on it

KOENIG
Of course you can

Take the pitcher from him drop my head douse myself the
cold cuts cobwebs Bradley walks in imperious Koenig moves
past -- ice forms between the two

KOENIG (CONTD)
Chief

BRADLEY
What are you doing here

KOENIG
The Lieutenant was thirsty
Koenig closes the door I refuse to look up at Bradley

BRADLEY
Progress on Magdalena

I point to Junior -- happy to play teacher’s pet

JUNIOR STEMMONS
No fingerprints Clean crime scene
Canvassed the neighborhood A
senile neighbor did report a
possible Peeper-

-rubbing the back of my head where the Peeper bashed me-

ME
-confirmed Peeper

Bradley turns to me

BRADLEY
Is that who knocked you out

ME
Noonan knocked me out

BRADLEY
(beat)
He’s having you tailed then

ME
And he knows the Magdalena name and
that I was chasing a suspect -- the

Peeper Lucille strips for

JUNIOR STEMMONS
She knows someone watches

ME
And who he is She has to
(back to Bradley)
I want access to her juvie sheet or
whatever arrest records exist
Rumor was Hector whored her out to
dealers he did business with

BRADLEY
That’s immaterial

ME
(as my teeth grit)
It is if youre eliminating her as
a suspect-—

BRADLEY
-did you confirm their alibi

Point to the ever-studious Junior

JUNIOR STEMMONS
I spoke with a Mr and Mrs Preston
Mott of Santa Barbara the parents
of Madge Magdalena nee Mott and
they’ve confirmed their visit and
also corroborated the argument that
resulted in them leaving early

BRADLEY
(back to me now)
One alteration to my previous
orders-—

ME
-previous orders being what Assign
the Cop Noonan blames for his dead
boxing probe to the case that’s
becoming his new crusade

Bradley conjures the Roman visagethen slowly opens the

door staring holes in me

BRADLEY
Step out Stemmons

Junior balks looks my way tries to mimic my sneer I stand
and shove him toward the door His look back at me Judas

Bradley closes the door behind him

BRADLEY (CONTD)
No direct approach on the mother or
the daughter

ME
No Madge was a battered wife and
Lucille was a suborned whore If
that’s not motive what is You
want answers then we brace those
two hard

BRADLEY
If you do so directly if they’re
formally questioned then Noonan may
find out and go after them with
Federal warrants

FH HF

ME
Noonan will figure out who and what
Hector was sooner or later

BRADLEY
Yes he will so we buy time keep
him busy-

ME

-until when

BRADLEY
Until Tom Bethune votes on the
floor of the city council in two
days ratifying the official start
of construction on Dodger stadium-

ME
-this is bigger than a fucking
ballpark Hector Magdalena and
Narco is the powder-keg blows the
whole Department to hell

BRADLEY
Don’t be dramatic it looks weak
Right now Noonan needs a pursuit
so I supply him with one-

ME
-me You want me to draw him off-

BRADLEY
-you’ve been drawing him off And
the more he sees you the less he’1l1l
think of anything other than
getting you Now find Tommy and
take him alive Do not let Noonan
get to him As a potential major
case witness against the LAPD
Tommy Magdalena isn’t just a powder-
keg he’s an atom bomb

Bradley walks Watch him disappear down the hall

ME (VO)
Bradley has a bigger angle and I’m
getting close to itI just
haven’t hit home Yet

INT MEG’S PLACE - LATER 84
Bust in shaking Teeth chatter like I’m freezing Pete in the
garage adjacent the kitchen welder’s goggles and a power
drill punching holes in Juniors safe
PETE

I know what Feds look like -- those
were Feds with Junior

ME
Yeah and they made me leaving the
scene Had to barter out

PETE
Barter what

ME
My Testimony I signed a Federal
Witness Agreement

Pete drops the drill

PETE
You what

ME

It’s bullshit Noonan’s got no
intention of honoring it

(beat)
They want Stemmons files though I
think Junior’s been working angles
for awhile doing his own
investigations

PETE
What did you do to his place Nice
quiet neighborhood one minute
Nagasaki the next

ME
(point to safe)
He had a hand grenade tied to that
(as Pete resumes drilling)
How much longer do you need

PETE

Few more hours Maybe Junior
didn’t skimp on this thing I gotta
bore right through the face plate

(beat)
You got some time now why don’t
you get Milteer off my back and go
work that Bledsoe broad

ME
You read my mind
85 EXT TOPANGA CANYON BUNGALOW - NIGHT 85

Pull in Glenda’s Vette parked behind Lights on low inside

EXTINT BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER 86

The door opens She’s dressed for bed I don’t hesitate
afraid she’ll shun me Move to her she doesn’t startle An
arm around her waist drawing her in my mouth close to hers

I take her face in my hand check her eyes a beat before
they tell me it’s okayI lean in takes a lifetimeand
kiss her soft until she kisses back her mouth moving over my
split lips she puts her hands on my face pulling me in

She feels exactly like I imagined

My coat comes off Her camisole follows We’re moving toward
a bed in back I stop pull back the moonlight moves over
her shoulders I whisper

ME
tell me if Im being too rough

Tears squeezed through smiling eyes she kisses me even
harder pulls me down to her We make love like we’ve never
touched another Everything blurs burns down Bradley
Wilhite Tommy Hector Junior Ainge She takes it all away
I escape into her Hours fall I could stay here forever

INT BEDROOM - LATER 87

Lying there staring at her A silence and peace I’ve never
known Not once

ME
Tell me anything Tell me
everything

Label her surprise her brow that furrows and unfurrows just
as quickly A long moment as she waiverscommits

GLENDA BLEDSOE
Where would I start

ME
Why here

GLENDA BLEDSOE
Why LA
(this amazing smile)
Why is anybody here Want the rest
of the world to know who they are

You

GLENDA BLEDSOE
NoI don’t think so
(beat)
I just love it I grew up in
Seattle My aunt every week she’d
take me to the movies

Me watching hertucks her hair back over his shoulders

GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT’D)
The idea that you can outlive
yourselfthat a part of you goes
on long after you’re gone
(beat grins)
Sounds silly doesn’t it ‘Attack of
the Atomic Vampires’ being-

ME
-your ticket to immortality

Make her laugh Swear a thousand silent oaths to protect her
He face slowly goes dark

GLENDA BLEDSOE

Hughes told me he could get me in
for this screen test two years ago
Movie with Gregory Peck at
Universal He thought he was
humoring meuntil I got it They
offered me the rolethere in the
room So Howard who I’m sure never
thought in a million years Id land
that part makes some phone calls
and just like that they don’t want
me anymore

(beat)
Nobody calls now I can’t get in to
see any studio casting people He’s
ruined me in those circles

ME
And you still want it-

GLENDA BLEDSOE
-bad enough to put on a silly
cheerleading skirt and try to make
the most god-awful dialogue sound
decent
ME
Surrounded by winos in werewolf
suits
(she laughs I laugh)
That’sdedication

GLENDA BLEDSOE
Or desperation Depends on the day

The laughter ebbs her eyes still shine

GLENDA BLEDSOE (CONTD)
Ill get there though
(beat)
I’1l get there

I let the silence taketry not to shatter it with

ME
Dwight Gillette

She doesn’t blanch

GLENDA BLEDSOE

He asked me to take his ‘niece and
nephew’ to their cousin in Oxnard
These beautiful funny little kids

(tears she doesn’t swipe)
I dropped them off Didn’t ask any
questions -- I believed Dwight A
week later I saw their pictures in
the Post Office A week after that
their little bodies came in on the
tide near San Pedro

(beat tears stream)
Ill never shake the thought that
maybe those poor kids thought I was
part of it That I knew what was
going to happen to them So I pray
to God that he let them look in
when I put that knife into Dwight

(beat)
But I’1ll never ask his forgiveness
for doing it

(beat clears her eyes)
Why do they call you ‘Enforcer’

She actually gets closer I can feel her breath on me

ME
I’ve killed 44 men

She blanches but never blinksnever takes her eyes away
from mine

ME (CONTD)
33 for War 2 for principle 9 for
profit -- mostly Why did you sign
with Hughes knowing what he was

GLENDA BLEDSOE
‘For profit -- mostly’

Silence A feeling like ‘and there we are’

ME
I’m not much good

GLENDA BLEDSOE
Me neither

She touches my quake Two breaths with her hand on mine and
it all goes quiet the shakes the images the fear She
takes my head pulls me to her bare breasts The only things
audible my breathing a clock ticking Both slowly fade out

eye toward Junior’s desk Koenig going through his drawers

Stop Veer toward him

KOENIG
(formal-frosty )

Your young partner called me at my

home early this morning
Teeth grit Hide it Let Koenig talk

KOENIG (CONTD)

Heavily inebriated Speaking
inarticulately of ‘betrayal’ and how
the LAPD was set to be ‘blitzed by
justice’ Is this the ‘bind’ of
which we spoke earlier

ME
Yeah
KOENIG
And his apartment -- there was some

type of disturbance A fire

ME

That’s why I needed his address I
was trying to help him before
something like this happened The
kid snapped-in-half Fritz He’s
literally lost it

(beat deadpan)
He say anything else to you

Koenig looks back at me Give nothing away

-one gesture that

doesn’t read right and he’ll know He lets more seconds pass

than he should Trying to shake me

KOENIG
Only that he was in possession of
materials that might deeply damage
Chief Bradleyand yourself

ME
Like I said Fritz he’s flipped his
lid I don’t want to go to Internal
Affairs but I’m afraid Junior
might’ve forced just that

KOENIG
Let me try to locate the lad first
Dave Be a shame to ruin such a
young career so soon

ME
Be careful Fritz He’s dangerous

Spin press on toward Bradleys office

ME (VO)

EXT CHAVEZ RAVINE - DAY

Noonan’s deadline lapsed ten
minutes ago An official fugitive
from justice now

Down below Bradley with Reuben Ruiz in-tow glazed-fear
following him like he’s handcuffed PROTESTORS gather
placards hoisted chants “Dodgers No Mexico Si The
group gathers steam supporters pack in the chorus
continues “DODGERS NO MEXICO SI’

ME (VO)
Bradley doing damage control the
forced relocation of the Ravine’s
immigrants has the press ina
feeding frenzy Reuben Ruiz forced
along as the token Mexican
mouthpiece

Reporters press Bradley handles them with ease and aplomb

BRADLEY
-this area has long been rife with
crime and venality but with a
brand new Stadium we can make this
horrible blight a bright spot and
give our Los Angeles Dodgers the
home they deserve

(like Ruiz was an orphan)
Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his
travails growing up in this
horrible slum and why now is the
time to ‘Redeem The Ravine’

REPORTER 2
Chief Bradley US Attorney
Noonan has promised to deliver
surprise witnesses before the
Federal Grand jury on-

-Bradley this brilliant rebuke

BRADLEY
-Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous
hack politician whose smear
campaign against us will fail for
he has grievously underestimated
the moral rectitude of the Los
Angeles Police Department

Then Bradley sees me His press-friendly face contorts the
shift startling if only a flashbulb could’ve framed it He
shifts back from snarl to smile

BRADLEY
Now if you’1l excuse me I’1l leave
you with Reuben Ruiz

Ruiz begins his forcedcoerceddo-it-or-we’1ll-fuck-you sob
story as Bradley steps away from the glare I follow Get
right on his heels

ME
Your subpoena hasn’t caught up to
me yet Chief

Bradley spins back
ME (CONTD)

(hand him Juniors file)
Hurwitz Holdings

Bradley blanches buckles I see it Before he can play
stupid with ‘What’

ME (CONT’D)

You Bethune and Gallaudet bought
big chunks of Chavez Ravine over
the past two years through a shell
company called Hurwitz Holdings

(beat look around)
If the Dodgers move here the value
of the land boomsyou could sell
it off for a fortune -- or hang
onto it and make even more The
parking lots alone would make you
all multi-millionaires

Bradley removes his glasses staring at documentation that
dooms both his immediate and distant future

ME
Word gets out that the three City
Officials who were pushing hardest
for a Stadium also stood to gain a
mint -- might color public opinion
Might color it even more to know
that the LAPD’s Chief of Detectives
was trying to purchase a huge tract
of that land from the biggest dope
dealer in town

Slap another file over the one he’s reading

ME
Hector Magdalena owned ten and half
acres of this land
(beat ram him)
You didn’t give a shit about
solving his disappearance You were
worried that your real estate deal

was going south
(MORE)

ME (contd)

That’s why you wanted Tommy found
not because he was a murder suspect
or you were concerned that Noonan
might tap him as a federal
witnessyou needed him to
finalize your fucking land grab To
sign paperwork in place of his dead
Dad Thats why youve got Madge
and Lucille in custody now

(beat)
Maybe I’11 let your subpoena find
me now Chief maybe Ill walk right
into itthe tales I could tell

All Bradley can muster is

BRADLEY
How

ME
Junior Stemmons The ex-evidence
teacher His ‘excellent ratings’
didn’t stop him from stealing the
Magdalena seizure and doing his own
investigation

BRADLEY
Why would he investigate me

Hand him Noonan’s business card dig the big Federal Eagle in
American Blue

ME
That was stapled to the cover
(beat)
Why would Noonan worry about a Turd
like me nowwhen a high profile
target like you can be taken down

Silence I smile wide at it Bradley scrambling

BRADLEY
Where is Stemmons

ME

No idea If you haven’t spoken to
Internal Affairs today I’m sure
they’ve called Junior’s apartment
caught fire Deeply deviant
material inside Round him up-

(my angle)
-and anyone he’s got with him

Bradley readjusts his glasses

BRADLEY
I’1l issue an APB saying
Stemmons is a known deviant
targeting kindergarten children

ME
Now quid pro quoyou subpoenaed
Wilhite too

Bradley’s reaction Feature the angler getting angled

BRADLEY
How do y-

ME
-don’t worry ‘how’ Why

Bradley says nothing Then like a klieg-light it hits me

ME (CONT’D)
Youre going after Narco yourself

BRADLEY
Exposing the corrupt parts of the
LAPD will redeem the whole I’11
prove that Police can police
themselves-—

ME
-so you show-up Noonanco-opt his
crusade and condemn your own before
he canJesus Christ can you turn
lemons to lemonade

BRADLEY
No Cop will testify against other
Cops This is why Wilhite has
suddenly disappeared

ME
And how
(beat)
So where do we go now Chief

BRADLEY
(beat eyes flick again to
the files I’m holding)
There are other forces at work
herefaces we need to identify
Names we need to know A third

party

(MORE)

BRADLEY (contd)
Find out who Klein and I’1l
reinstate you rescind that
subpoena and burn the coroner’s
report on Sanderline-

ME
-that report is only useful to
Noonan now

BRADLEY
No It ensures our mutual
destruction should you choose to
share the contents of that Stemmons
file Which I know you won’t do
until you figure out how it will
best benefit you

He walks off imperious impervious gets engulfed by the
press ranks once again

ME (VO)
A mistake to underestimate me now

secrets is steepand you’re going
to pay up Soon

Where’s the knife

Junior this evil little curl He turns Follow him over a
small knoll that Gray Packard waiting A silhouette behind
the wheel As we near it the lights come on blind me

ME
Turn your lights offand just
come out and talk to meFritz

Bradleys greatest stroke was
enlisting you to his side

Junior jumpy in my periphery I don’t like it
ME (CONTD)
Wilhite ran Magdalena for you not

Narco

KOENIG
When did you know

ME
I didn’t I had a feeling I
smelled cover-up all over Hectors
disappearance and Wilhite wouldn’t
have the muscle or the mind-set to
kingpin something that big by
himselfyou knew about Bradley
trying to buy him out

KOENIG
He was offering to exonerate Hector
and clear his criminal record
Hector met with Wilhite and I to
inform us of his decision

FLASHBACK TO

Koenig pets Hectors twin Doberman guard dogs

KOENIG (VO) (CONT’D)
-e-and although the terms of that
deal worked well for him I found
them less than favorable

Koenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before
shooting a shocked Hector twice in the chest Wilhite
staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the
coup de grace head-shot to Hector

fondness for Lads stretching back
to his days at the academy

And now you’re his only ally

(back at Junior)
This sad queer who fell out with
cops and flunked out with the Feds

(back to Koenig)
So you get this file to battle
Bradley with What’s Junior get in
return

And like he was waiting for those words Junior lunges I
twist to deflect but he’s too fast -- feel something sink and
drag in my side I go down gougegroping for my gun Instant
trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm fingers failing Then a
pain like boiling oil moves through my blood

Look down SEE A mother-of-pearl knife hilt in my side the

Koenig reads the file’s first page lifts ita blank page

made

Koenig spins back more blank pages spilling from the file

KOENIG
This isnt it

-Junior looks that’s all I need Pull the pig-sticker off my
ankle and corkscrew it into his calf twisting Junior bleats

slaughtered-lamb as I reach up a wrench his gun free Grab

his tie pull him down as I jut his gun up under his chin and

fire two shots through the top of his head

Haul him down dead by his tie turn -- Koenig’s gun-hand
flashes to his shoulder Shoot him twice He goes down

gargling ‘fuck’ Stand-up on me sea-legs bad wobbleweave as

I slowly pull the knife from my side pocket it Feel blood

flow saturate my pant leg This weird wooze overcomes me as I

approach Koenig

He pulls himself into a sitting position shaking his head
This bemused beaten half-grin as he flicks blood from his
hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky

KOENIG
Poorly played Davepoorly
played

Say nothing Keep Junior’s 45 out My intention crystal
clear endgame Koenig looks up this odd squint like a bum
about to beg for change

KOENIG
Could I talk you into something
Cut you in on something

Give him no hope

ME
Won’t work for me Fritz

He nods remorse resignationit at all looks the same now

KOENIG
Give me a minute then

I do Watch his hands as he removes his shoes waiting for an
ankle grab his back-up piecenone comes He sets his shoes
aside gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this
short gruff laughsome inside joke that will die untold

BRADLEY
Things like

BRADLEY
This body is in your possession

Just nod

And it’s what you need to burn
Narco to the groundbut if those
files and his body were to be given

pale what is this Somebody to the left look Milteer Look
back at Pete tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with
aright cross

that

Instant-drop moan Glenda screaming

ME (CONTD)
Don’t kill me

Pete looks to Milteer wipes blurred eyes

MILTEER
The harder you hit him the quicker
I say ‘stop’ -- and cease that

absurd crying

Pete bludgeons me I try to get closer to Glenda Feel my

nose shatter Another swing right cheek detonates A left
hook to take advantage of my momentum left eye explodes

Glenda’s cryingscreaming gets me madder than anything

GLENDA BLEDSOE

THAT IMPOTENT SHIT-—

MILTEER
-touch me and he dies

Pete knocks me down again My face in pieces

Kick him-kick him-kick him

Pete hesitates puts his boot into my guts 1 2 3-

MILTEER (CONTD)
(prim official)
-you may stop
(beat for the room)
Howard determined that this was the
price for your time together

Milteer produces a Polaroid takes a snapshot of my shattered
husk hands the camera to Pete on his way out

MILTEER
You still have a job

Milteer gone I spit volumes of blood I’1l talk with a slur
for the next year Pete reaches for me blotto sobbing

PETE

Pushing out words past shattered teeth

ME

Big drunk nod from Pete Glenda panicking trying to stanch
blood that keeps rushing Pete reeling drunk leans down
stuffs something in my jacket

PETE
I’m so sorry

INT SHOWER - TIME UNKNOWN 100

Steaming water Almost painful I sit in the tub let the
shower rain down Drain floods diluted red Wash my wounds
my soul So many bruises I look bubonic My face still
swelling already purple-black My left eye more than swollen
shut On the other side of the curtain

Glenda naked Beauty that catches in my chest Try to stand
turn my destroyed face She gently pushes me back down Sits
into me holds my face in both hands so that the water hits

my lips No nerves no unease Home She closes the curtain
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT 101

Post-coital Both wide awake Still scared

GLENDA
Let me take you to a hospital

ME
We’d never make it inside

GLENDA
(big beat)
I’m worried

ME
I’m through the worst of it

She frames my face with her hands

GLENDA
I don’t believe you

Lies will only leak expose The silence makes me just as
guilty She lets me off the hook her head on my arm leaning

in I kiss her

GLENDA (CONTD)
(at a whisper)
Was I worth this

ME
Whatever the cost

GLENDA
Just like that then

ME
Just like that

A nod An understanding Another kiss the last one I’1ll
remember
