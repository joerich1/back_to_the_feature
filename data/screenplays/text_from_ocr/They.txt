Everyone else in the car trades looks

Im just
asking

PAUL

Like what The

Boogeyman

JULIA

The Boogeyman

The thing under the bed The monster hiding in the closet

TERRY

What made you

think of that

JULIA

A little girl

at Sams house She was convinced there was a monster trying to get
her

PAUL
Youre saying

you believe her

Julia is

suddenly on the spot She backtracks

JULIA

Of course I

dont There are no monsters Not really

SAM

Sure there are

Ted Bundy Son of Sam

Ed Gein

TERRY

Who was Ed

Gein

SAM
He was a mass

murderer This old hermit whod kill people and take the parts he
wanted Heads

Livers Intestines Sex organs

TERRY

Why did he use

the parts for

SAM

Everything The

police found a skull that was used for a soup bowl Faces were stuffed
and

mounted like hunting trophies on the wall Bones were used for
furniture

PAUL

He also wore

their skin Like clothes

Terry recoils

into her seat Grossed out
TERRY

Sorry I

asked

SAM

You wanted

proof There it is

JULIA

But its not

like hes a monster under the bed

SAM

So

JULIA

So why are kids

afraid of that

SAM
Because they

live in a completely different world than we do

(then)

Think about it

Why do kids pick up on things that we cant Bumps in the night

footsteps in the hallway A thumping inside their closet

PAUL

Overactive

imagination

SAM

Wrong Perfect

awareness

(beat)

Kids have a

perfect awareness of everything around them Every sound Every

shadow

Everything gets

quiet

SAM (contd)

The Boogeyman

could be real So could monsters Just because youve never seen them
doesnt

mean they arent there

Silence The

car engine purrs softly This is starting to make sense And its
spooky

PAUL

All right Im

creeped out But my bullshit alarm is going off

SAM

You just cant

PAUL

Right Because

He starts

walking towards it

past the

Sam approaches

the ditch Darkness is all around

He kneels down

alongside the body of the animal Very little is visible of the corpse
except

for its dark mangled form sprawled across the dirt

Sam picks up a

stick and pokes at the body Nothing happens

He pokes at the

corpse again

The hind legs

of the corpse suddenly twitch A reflex action Sam leaps back The
life nearly

scared out of him
A flap of

hairless skin slides away from one of the animals hind legs Sam
leans forward

to get a better look becoming simultaneously repulsed and fascinated

SAM

Hey guys

PAUL

What

Take a look at

this

JULIA

Is ita

dog

Sam glances at

the dead corpse and back to his friends again He looks shaken
SAM

I dont

know

The rest of the

group moves down the road A weird unease has started to settle in

Paul and Julia

kneel down in front of the corpse Its almost unrecognizable The
darkness

smothering the road keeps them from getting a handle on any of the
bodys

features

PAUL

It looks like a

dog to me

SAM

Did you see the

leg
PAUL

What about

it

Sam takes the

stick and gently pushes away the flap of torn skin for a better look
The group

leans forward

A deep bleeding

wound has been exposed Through the torn flesh and blood pumping over
charcoal

skin the group can see bones flashing into the moonlight But
intermingled with

the animals skeleton are

PIECES OF METAL

Glittering and

clean A series of connected stainless steel threads and pallid bone
that have

grown together

SAM
Ever seen

anything like that

PAUL

No

SAM

It looks like

steel Like someone put steel into its body

PAUL

I dont think

it was put in there It looks like it grew that way

JULIA

Thats

impossible What kind of animal has steel in its skeleton

Terry steps

forward tentatively
TERRY

JULIA

Are you sure

PAUL

Come on honey

Paul races back
to the Range Rover and opens the passenger door He withdraws Julias

camera

Julia takes a

step back into the middle of the road The wind is sifting through the
trees

creating a soft HISSING noise as the branches dance and twist in the

shadows

Paul returns

and hands the camera to Sam

You want to

turn it over

Im not

touching it

Sam kneels

down He points the camera and shoots

The camera

flash cuts through the darkness and falls upon the corpse But only

JULIA

Go ahead

SAM

Last night on

the road after I took the picture and we started walking to Pauls
car did you

have the same feeling

JULIA
What

feeling

SAM

That we were

being chased

Julia doesnt

say anything

She stops cold

in her tracks Just ahead of her resting motionless in the ditch is

A BODY

Swathed in dark

fur twisted at a pathetic angle huge gashes in its side The corpse
of a DOBERMAN PINSCHER Flies are BUZZING

and swarming over the dogs open wounds

Julia and Sam

move towards the dogs lifeless form

JULIA
Theres your

monster

SAM

Thats a

dog

JULIA

Right

Sam kneels in

front of the corpse Waves off some flies

SAM

Thats not what

I saw

JULIA

I dont see any

other corpses on the side of the road do you
A long moment

Sam stares back down at the Dobermans body

SAM

Thats not what

I saw

CLOSE ON THE

DOG

Eyes slightly

open A misshapen form plagued with flies

The sound of

INSECTS SWARMING drowns out the WIND HISSING through the trees

EXT FOREST -

WALKING TRAIL - DAY

Paul is jogging

through the woods A light mist hangs in the cool air The sounds of
the forest

surround him
Suddenly the

birds stop singing Paul becomes aware of this He stops running and
looks

around The forest is deathly still

The sound of a

TWIG being crushed underfoot Then nothing

Another moment

Paul keeps going a chill on his spine looking back over his
shoulder

Rovers parking
space

PAUL

Good Shes

JULIA

I feel sorry

for those people

PAUL

Me too But

JULIA

People are

ignoring her Maybe thats the only way she can get attention

PAUL

Shes doing a
good job Kept me away

They start

crossing the street towards the car

JULIA

How does

someone end up like that

PAUL

I think were

witnessing it first-hand with Sam

anyway

JULIA

CRICKETS CHIRPING in the grass

Julia wanders
outside holding some of the developed photographs from the party Sam
is sitting

on the front steps working on his drawing

JULIA

Sam Could you

Sam looks up

from his drawing pad

JULIA

Never mind

Julia sits on

the porch glider and looks through the photos The little girl looking
back over

her shoulder The blurred shape inside of the shed
A moment

passes Julia shuts her eyes as a slight breeze comes up She slips
into a

dream-like state calm and relaxed before opening her eyes to find

THE BLOND

STUDENT

Sitting back on

the hood of a sports car Wearing a white tank top undershirt The
tattooed S

insignia visible on his shoulder Bathed in soft moonlight He even
looks good

A spacious

bedroom Typical

Julia is

already in bed and wearing a night shirt Paul is grinding out a set
of

crunches

JULIA

It just would

have been nice if somebody had looked at it You were on the internet
Terry was

on the phone I felt like I was living with a bunch of machines
instead of

people

PAUL

Someones

overreacting

JULIA

Would you look

at it again
PAUL

I already did

And I still dont see anything

Paul gets into

bed

JULIA

That little

girl said there was a monster in the shed

PAUL

(kisses

her)

It was probably

another dog Good night

He switches off

the light Paul turns over and goes to sleep
Julia sits for

a moment in the dark Alone with her thoughts She looks over at the
walk-in

closet across the room

The closet door

is slightly open Just a crack Not enough to provide any clear view
of what

lies within but just enough for something -- monsters included -- to
peek

out

Julia stares at

the closet Spooked She knows better but its dark and her primal
fears are

taking control

JULIA

(to

herself)

Stupid

She gets out of

bed and tiptoes to the closet shutting the door Then she gets back
into bed
Smiling to herself she goes to sleep

in

THE CLOSET DOOR IS WIDE OPEN

A childhood

nightmare come to life Julias breathing quickens She reaches
towards the

other side of the bed

JULIA
(a

whisper)

Paul

Her hand finds

nothing but sheets and empty space Theres nobody there She quickly
turns to

locate her boyfriend But hes gone

She tries to

switch on the light CLICK

The light stays

off She tries again CLICK

Nothing

happens

Then she hears

it A faint sound Almost like a SHUFFLING The sound of something

dragging itself lightly across the floor to the edge of the bed

Julias throat
has gone dry Carefully she creeps towards Pauls side of the bed and
checks

the floor

There is

nothing in sight The only sign of movement are the shadows from the
trees

outside

There is only

one place left to look Julia cautiously steps down to the floor
Sinking down

on her knees she gently lifts up the dust ruffle and looks into the
inky

darkness underneath the bed The space is empty

Julia drops the

dust ruffle and sits up GASPING

A BLACK SHAPE

IS STANDING BEHIND HER

Then a

familiar voice comes from it

PAUL
Paul switches

on the light Hes wearing a UCLA sweatshirt

JULIA

The light

wouldnt turn on

PAUL

Works now

Julia catches

her breath The fear finally draining from her

JULIA

Where were

you

PAUL
I was cold so I

got a sweater from the closet And I went to the bathroom Why were
you looking

under the bed

Julia isnt

quite sure how to answer Shes embarrassed

Julia looks

towards the front door

Sam is sitting

on the porch steps sketching on his pad oblivious to everything
around

him

JULIA

Hes in his own

world isnt he

TERRY

Thats an

understatement I have a sinking feeling that sex is out of the
question for

this trip
This sparks

something in Julia She hesitates looking through an open doorway
where Paul

can be seen packing some clothes Julia speaks to Terry in confidence

JULIA

Do you

fantasize about other people

He kisses her

chill

running down her spine

INT BEDROOM

CLOSET - DAY

The door slowly

creaks open Julia stands in the doorway surveying the closet -- a
cluttered

and claustrophobic space despite its size Clothes draped on hangars
Cardboard

boxes stacked on shelves Shadows

Julia moves

inside and pulls a string hanging from a light bulb which acts as a
switch

Tick-tick The bulb stays dark She tries again

Tick-tick

The light still

wont come on
Julia carefully

looks through some of the clothes Nothing She kneels down and checks
the

floor

A long CREAKING

behind her The natural light fades

Julia looks

over her shoulder a bit skittish as the closet door eases back
towards the

doorjamb But theres nobody there Just the faintest hint of a draft

Julia keeps
searching through the clutter Moving shoes and boxes out of the way

Searching

Then she spots

something glittering in the ribbon of light coming from the closet
doorway A

small object resting in the corner Julia reaches down and picks it up

A PIECE OF

METAL
Small and

intricate with erratic markings Twisted and strangely ornate The
shape and

texture of the metal is almost completely alien

Julia holds the

metal into the light Extremely curious Behind her a shadow moves

CRASH Julia

SCREAMS dropping the object and whirling around as a cardboard box
SMASHES down

behind her Tumbling from one of the shelves above Old shoes scatter
across the

floor

Julia catches

her breath Heart pounding

On the floor

the metal object sparkles in the light A draft HISSES through the
open closet

door

from page to page allowing momentary glimpses of various drawings

maidens bed

as she puts

down the book and grabs another from a stack on the table She opens
it and

starts paging through

CLOSE ON - THE

As Julia finds

a drawing of a sleeping child Just beyond the bed is an open closet
door the

horrid face a MONSTER watching the child from within

Julia shivers

down to her soul A familiar feeling of late

A slight

SQUEAKING catches her attention She looks across the reading room to
find

A YOUNG BOY

Ten years old

Tow-haired Sitting a few tables away but almost directly opposite
her Hes

wearing a Superman shirt

He smiles

timidly and waves Julia waves back

A THUMP behind
her Julia turns and looks over her shoulder She barely catches sight
ofa

shadow slipping across the wall in the stacks

The SCRAPING of

chair legs against the cold floor Julia looks back towards where the
BOY was

sitting The chair is pushed back and empty

Another

THUMPING in the stacks Then silence

anxiety washes over Julia as she grabs some of the books and leaves

job last night
Julia hands him

the metal object from the closet

talking about

My girlfriend

believes in the Boogeyman

JULIA

I never said it

was the Boogeyman Maybe its some primeval energy that causes a
response in

human beings This could be the physical representation of that
energy

Julia Its

piece of shit

I disagree

Julia turns

hopefully to Terry --
JULIA

Yes

TERRY

Its the

physical representation of a piece of shit

getting a good

look at Sams detailed drawing of --

Completely

fleshed out with distinct mechanical parts hinged into flesh and bone
Almost as

accurate as a photograph

hit on the road It wasnt a dog It wasnt some primeval force

INKLING sound as he kicks something at his feet His eyes blink open

enclosed by pine trees A few birds are singing overhead

Hanging from

branches Scattered on the ground Like the skin of a snake which has
been

shed

completely unsettled He kneels down picking up a flap of skin from
the ground
peeling it away from a steel ROD dripping with oozing slime Holds it
up Its

still black in color but almost transparent in the murky light

The wind HISSES

through the trees mussing Pauls hair

Paul drops the

piece of skin on the ground

The birds

abruptly stop singing in unison The WIND CEASES

around the forest The sudden quiet has got him spooked His arms and
legs

stiffen Paul cant even bring himself to move or breathe

whirls around grabbing his shoulder to find

hand away from the railing Looks skyward and discovers more BONES are
being

used to brace the ceiling along with metal beams

She stops

Shutting her eyes in fear Starts to lose control
From somewhere

within she manages to steady herself Keeps going through the
awaiting steam

curtain at the bottom

INT MAIN

HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS

The steam parts

to reveal a dark space Cold and damp

Julia moves

into the main hallway stumbling through a hallway that can best be
described as

a living nightmare Mammoth pipes and human skin has been fashioned
together

into a wall pulsating with the HEARTBEAT OF MACHINES that saturates
the entire

hallway

Steam jets into

the hallway intermittently from the pipes Creating great clouds

Julia is beyond

horrified Her face registers a numbness Complete and total
astonishment
Human bones and
body parts have been so expertly fashioned into the corridor that its

impossible to distinguish where the organic ends and the mechanical
begins

She enters

another corridor Her face is struck by a JET OF HISSING STEAM

She presses

onward Slipping past the skulls and littered metal on the floor

Another BLAST

OF STEAM

Something leaps

out of the middle of it

Julia whirls

back around a corner pressing flat against the wall as a BLACK SHAPE
moves

through the steam Unidentifiable features Movements that suggest
nothing by

chaos and madness

The SHAPE

HISSES and CROAKS in the hallway
Julia waits

She doesnt even breathe The HISSING stops

She gradually

turns to peek back into the hallway where the thing once stood

CLOSE ON

JULIAS EYES

as she looks

around the corner The shape has disappeared

Carefully she

keeps going forward Drenched in water and sweat Slipping through the
steam

clouds that mask another entrance

INT LAIR -

NIGHT

A massive room

where empty human skins are dangling from hooks complete and
preserved from

head to toe The skins sway and rock gently in the draft Thousands of
them
Julia moves

towards the center of the room

A large

OPERATING TABLE awaits But the surface of the table is sunken like a
water

basin Next to the table is a pedestal littered with BLOODY
INSTRUMENTS Cutting

tools Knives Curved hooks

Julia notices

that Pauls torn clothes are resting at the foot of the table Shirt
shredded to

a rag Sneakers orphaned nearby Jeans spattered with blood

Her breathing

quickens Her heart POUNDING

She reaches the

foot of the table Paul is lying within the basin completely naked
and

partially covered with LITTERED BODY PARTS Organs and entrails

The basin is

filled with water and blood An immobile form is resting next to him
Julia moves

quickly She tries to wake him up

JULIA
Paul Paul
wake up

He stirs His

nose crinkles slightly

JULIA (contd)

Wake up

She grabs him

and lifts him up He starts COUGHING

JULIA (contd)

Youve gotta

hurry

(then)
Here

Julia grabs his

jeans She helps him slide down from the basin and he pulls them on

A skinned HAND

grabs hers Julia yelps a SCREAM

The other form
-- a THING in the basin -- rises

and turns Slicked with blood Empty sockets where the eyes should be
Mouth

falling open A horror that shouldnt be alive

Julia SCREAMS

again

Her free hand

grabs a HOOK from the pedestal and swings the blade into the things
neck Blood

fountains up

The thing

begins SHRIEKING

With Paul
leaning on her for support Julia rapidly heads for the door

INT MAIN

HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS

Julia navigates

her way through the hallways Moving blindly through sudden JETS OF
STEAM the

sound of MACHINES around them Paul leans on her his eyes remaining
closed

COUGHING and stumbling

Racing through

the halls The steam clouds suddenly EXPLODING into her view

INT STAIRWELL

- CONTINUOUS

Julia reaches

the stairwell and helps Paul climb the steps She looks back over her
shoulder

Nothing behind them

INT CORRIDOR -
CONTINUOUS

Julia stops at

the corridor opening The strobe light FLASHES within Clicking

The corridor

looks empty Nothing but pipes and shadows

JULIA

Were almost

there

Julia turns to

Paul and finds a face with glaring yellow eyes and metal teeth He
stares back

at her

A moment of

sheer horror Julia reels back into the corridor Pressed flat against
the wall

Sliding towards the crawl space opening

Paul starts

advancing into the corridor Grinning with teeth that flash with every
click of
the strobe light

She keeps

sliding away

He grabs his

chest and RIPS IT OPEN tearing the covering skin apart as he would a
shirt A

menagerie of human bones and metal are revealed behind it

Julia tries to

scream Eyes wide She cant make a sound

Paul tears the

skin covering his chest wider Pulling it away Stripping himself
clean

Julia reaches

the crawl space Sliding down

The last pieces

Pauls skin are torn off The thing that had been pretending to be
Paul stands

in his place

Only brief
glimpses are allowed by the strobe light An abysm of immemorial

lunacy

consisting of fashioned human parts and twisted metal A human heart

beating

within exposed ribs Bones combined with pulleys and rods The face of

a skull

A contradiction of all matter and cosmic order

Julia slips

back into the crawl space Still

herself through the crawl space

trying to scream

Moving quickly Panicked

She kicks to her feet and tears off
Julia has

almost reached the platform opening for the train

BEHIND HER A

CHORUS OF PURSUING MONSTROUS SCREAMS RISE UP WITHIN THE TUNNEL

INT SUBWAY

STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

Julia runs

directly parallel to the subway platform The lights alongside of her
start

flickering and go out one by one as she advances

THE HISSING AND

SCREAMING CONTINUES TO RISE

She reaches the

opposite tunnel and grabs hold of the platform pulling herself up
The platform

goes dark

Appearing out

of the far tunnel are a DOZEN DARK SHAPES scampering along the walls
and
running on all fours across the tracks Their characteristics barely

visible

Julia kicks

back as the shrieking things bear down on her yellow eyes flaring in
the dark

metal teeth flashing

Julia tries to

run for the escalator but the things cover the walls behind the
tracks Ready

to spring

Finally one of

the monsters does leap towards her

AND IS SMASHED

TO BITS BY AN APPROACHING BART TRAIN

Reducing the

monster to a few vestiges of scattered metal The other creatures on
the tracks

are also run down

Julia watches

as the train RUMBLES past And then silence
Nothing is left

except for a few swirling newspapers The lights flicker and come back
to

life

Rising up to

her feet rescued from death by chance Julia starts backing towards
the

escalator Her eyes locked upon the darkened tunnel before she turns
and races

up
