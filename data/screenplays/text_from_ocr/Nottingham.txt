FADE IN
EXT CASTLE UNDER SIEGE - NIGHT
A Byzantine fortress overlooking the Mediterranean Sea

A FULL MOON illuminates a MEDIEVAL ARMY complete with a SIEGE
TOWER CATAPULTS and BATTERING RAMS ferociously ATTACKING
the fortress

CASTLE MARCAPPUS CYPRUS JULY 1191

The DEFENDERS of the castle fight back but theyre
OUTNUMBERED tento-one

THE CREW OF ONE ATTACKING CATAPULT

loads up a BOULDER and prepares to LAUNCH One of them grins
as he cups his hands to his mouth and YELLS up at the Castle
Walls

CYPRIOT CREWMAN
(in GREEK wsubtitles)
HERES YOUR DINNER YOU ENGLISH
BASTARDS

The Crewman releases the triggering mechanism and we FOLLOW
THE BOULDER AS IT SOARS HIGH UP INTO THE SKY -- but our view
SHIFTS leaving the boulder to ARC OVER THE CASTLE WALL as we
SUDDENLY PLUNGE STRAIGHT DOWN INTO THE GROUND AND KEEP GOING
DRIVING INTO THE SOLID DIRT ten feet deep twenty
thirty SUDDENLY BURSTING UPON AN UNDERGROUND CHAMBER -— a
TUNNEL «

INT MINE - UNDER THE GROUND

An ENGLISH NOBLEMAN barely 30 (middle-aged in 12th Century
terms) stripped to the waist covered in dirt and sweat
but still wearing a battle helmet - makes his way through
the TORCH-LIT shadows of the TUNNEL ite Low roof propped up
with rough-hewn WOODEN POSTS AND BEAMS Hes moving fast
but being careful not to spill the WATER hes carrying ina
heavy BRASS POT

INT FAR END OF THE MINE

HALP-A-DOZEN ENGLISH TUNNEL SOLDIERS line the walls of the
Mine They are all stripped to the walst covered in sweat
and dirt They carry swords maces flails axes and
ENTRENCHING TOOLS -- picks and shovels and wooden buckets
None of them looks happy --
ENGLISH SOLDIER
Fucking hell I came on crusade to
liberate Jerusalem and touch my
hand to the True Cross -- not fight
Greeks like a worm under the earth

The English Soldier is suddenly CONKED ON THE HEAD from
behind --

NOBLEMAN
(WHISPERING)
Put on your helmet and be quiet

All eyes turn to the Nobleman --

ENGLISH SOLDIER
(denning his HELMET)
Yes six Sir Robert Sorry but

The Nobleman SIR ROBERT TORNHAM - presses his finger to
the Soldier’s lips and the Soldier shuts up Tornham moves
to the END of the Mine and sets his bucket of water down
against the wall -- then can’t help but notice the eyes of
all the Soldiers staring at the water as if it were gold

He hesitates -- then removes his own helmet dips it into the
pot FILLS IT WITH WATER -- then passes his helmet to one of
the men motioning for him to pass it on down the line

TORNHAM (NOBLEMAN)
(WHISPERING)
One sip per man

Tornham’s waterfilled helmet makes its way through the ranke
as he kneele down and stares at the brass pot

fhe Soldiers keep SIPPING

Tornham keeps staring at the pot his steel-grey eves
NARROWING as he studies the water

The Soldiers exchange some looks - what the hell is Tornham
doing

Finally the firet English Soldiers curiosity gets the best
ef him He silently approaches Tornham kneels down beside
him WHISPERS in his ears

ENGLISH SOLDIER
Begging your pardon Sir Robert
but what are you --
Tornham raises a hand to silence his questioner and keeps
staring at the water the surface hag ever-so-slightly begun
to UNDULATE

Tornham DRAWS HIS SWORD MOTIONS to the others to do the
same He takes back his battle helmet fits it on hie head -

The Soldier STARES at the pot of WATER - watching FIRST in
confusion and then with dawning realization as its surface
starts to SWAY like a tide-pool --

TORNHAM
a fierce WHISPER to the
Soldiers)
TO ARMS Ready yourselves

Tornham’s eyes sweep across the MUDDY WALLS of the mine then
shoot back to the brass pot of WATER then back to the walls
gearching --

TORNHAM (CONTD)
(suddenly POINTING his
SWORD)
Here

All eyes lock onto the SECTION of the MINE WALL where Tornham
igs pointing -

TORNAHM (CONTD)
Torches

Everyone SNUFFS THEIR TORCHES tuxning the Mine pitch black
Silence

Then the MUFFLED SOUNDS of DIGGING in time to the SWAYING oF
THE WATER IN THE BUCKET -

Then a SUDDEN CRACK in the MINE WALL -- almost exactly where
Tornham was pointing and the GLOW of TORCHLIGHT peeking
through

The SOUND of VOICES speaking GREPK

ANOTHER CRACK and the MINE WALL starts to CRUMBLE HANDS with
PICKR-AZES now pushing through

The MINE WALL COLLAPSES INWARDS CYPRIOT KNIGHTS now pushing
their way through into the shadows

TORNHAM
Now
-- but before the Cypriot Knights can react the English
Tunnel Soldiers are on them ATTACKING from the darkness at
close quarters SLICING with their swords HACKING with their
picks taking out their surprised enemies one-by-one

Steel flashes by torchlight and the Cypriot Knights try to
fight back but theyre totally unprepared for the English
onslaught The surviving Cypriots RETREAT back into their
OWN TUNNEL Tornham and his fellow English Tunnel Soldiers
GIVING CHASE YELLING GUTTURAL BATTLE-CRIES AS THEY GO

EXT CASTLE UNDER STEGE - NIGHT

The same CATAPULT CREW loads-up another BOULDER and the same
Crewman YELLS UP to the wallss

CYPRIOT CREWMAN
OPEN YOUR MOUTHS FOR DESSERT YOU
ENGLISH BASTARDS

The Crewman goes to fire the catapult -- but before he can
make a move he’s run through with a SWORD

Robert Tornham yanks his blade from the Crewman’s chest then
leads his SCREAMING BLOODY AND HALF-NAKED TUNNEL SOLDIERS
OUT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CYPRIOT SIEGE MINE in a MERCILESS
SURPRISE APTACK ON THE ENTIRE CYPRIOT ARMY

Up on the parapets of the Castle Walls the remaining English
defenders watch and CHEER as their comrades proceed to win
the battle

Cup TO
EXT MANORHOUSE NIGHT

Close to the edge of 4 FOREST sits a cross between a mansion
and a castle wealthy lodgings surrounded by a defensible
wall But theres no sign of a siege here

IMC MANORHOUSE NIGHT

The GREAT HALL is filled with FOOD and DRINK along with
MUSIC and LAUGHTER It’s a FEAST for well-to-do NOBLE and
KRNIGHTLY FAMILIES attended to by an array of MALE and FEMALE
SERVANTS A ROUNDEL DANCE is in progress MEN AND WOMEN age
14 and up twirling in each others arme to the flutes and
drums of the MUSICIANS and the Lilt of the accompanying
CHORAL’S VOICES

A good time is being had by all -- but one good-looking YOUNG
MAN and equally well-—bred YOUNG WOMAN both Nobles are
dancing together and virtually glowing with joy
They exchange a series of looks ending with each of them
NODDING to the other then take advantage of the crowd to
surreptitiously DUCK QUTSIDE -- the Young Woman reaching out
to SNATCH A GOBLET OF BRANDYWINE off a serving tray as she
XLCES oe

EXT MANORHOUSE NIGHT

The Young Woman gips from the goblet and makes an impromptu
SPRINT for the forest the Young Man giving chase --

EXT FOREST -— NIGHT

The Young Man watches as the Young Woman leans back against a
LARGE TREE raises the goblet to her lips and sucks it dry

YOUNG WOMAN
(feigning sadness)
Were out of brandywine

The Young Man pins her against the tree pulls off her head-
dress letting her hair tumble down onto both their faces

YOUNG MAN
(hushed)
oe Good
and kigsees her

DEEPER IN THE FOREST

A STAG with a large pair of antlers silently watches as the
young noble couple begins to make love

CLOSE ON THE YOUNG COUPLE

Wrapped in each others arms kissing passionately -- until
the SOUND of a BREAKING BRANCH startles them They freeze
the Young Man peering into the shadowy woods around them -
The Stag emerges from the darkness

The Young Woman smiles at the noble creature

YOUNG WOMAN
Hes beautiful

The Young Man kisses the Young Woman on the neck -

YOUNG MAN
So are you

She MOANS as he moves his lips towards her breasts -—-
A sudden HIGH-PITCHED WHISTLING SOUND fills the night air --
Then a sharp jagged THUD

The eyes of both the Young Man and the Young Woman go WIDE
their breath catching in their throats

A single ARROW has gone through the Young Man’s BACK and into
the Young Woman’s CHEST IMPALING them both INTO THE TREE

The startled Buck races back into the woods leaving the
young couple frozen together in shock bleeding to death

EST CASTLE MARCAPPUS — DAWN

The last time we saw this place it was under attack -- but
now it site calm and peaceful beneath the warm light of an
early Mediterranean morning

INT CASTLE BED-CHAMBER - EARLY MORNING

Robert Tornham wakes throws off his blanket and sits up in
bed revealing himself to be completely naked Blinks his
eyes wipes sleep from them takes a deep breath -- then
pulls himself out of bed turnge to the East where the sun
has just risen and kneels in PRAYER

TORNHAM
Our Pather who desires that we all
be saved and gives us our daily
bread the Holy Sacrament for the
soul and needful sustenance for the
body For these I confide in you
Amen «

Tornham rises reaches over to a simple NIGHT-STAND pours a
pitcher of WATER into a bowl and SPLASHES some on his face
Then he wraps a piece of white linen around hia index finger
dips it firet into the water then in a small TRON SAUCER OF
SALT - and uses jit to BRUSH HIS TEETH When he‘s done he
crosses to the WINDOW undoes an TRON BAR and OPENS THE
SHUTTERS allowing the sunlight to stream in

He breathes in the morning opens his mouth in a great yawn
then heads through a narrow ARCHWAY and down a narrow stone
PASSAGE that winde ite way to

INT PRIVY CHAMBER - EARLY MORNING

This is what we now call the toilet Tornham -- still naked --
sits down to do his business
While he site he gtudies a CHESSBOARD Laid out beside his
seat the pieces in the MIDST OF AN ONGOING GAME He thinks

for a moment makes a MOVE - then spins the board around 80
he’s now playing black instead of white -- considers a
moment then makes another move

CUT TO
INT OFFICE CHAMBER — DAY
Tornham now fully dressed enters and furrows his brow at
the surprising sight of his SQUIRE THOMAS LESLIE -- 60 wise
but not wizened still in impressive shape for his age who

is in the midat of PACKING up everything in the room in a
series of BAGS and BOXES

SQUIRE THOMAS
Good morning Sir Robert I trust
your breakfast met with approval
Can you believe the locals on this
island prefer cows milk on their
cereal to wine

TORNHAM
Thankfully I have you to protect me
from such dire threats
(re the packing)
What in Gods name are you up to

SQUIRE THOMAS

It seems word of your brilliant
counter-mining stratagem and its
utter defeat of the rebellious
lecals reached the Royal ears of
King Richard -- and His Majesty was
quite impressed In fact he sent
you a personal message to that
effect

(indicating an unrolled

PARCHMENT sitting on the

desk)
which I took the liberty of
opening not wishing to disturb
that blissfully deep slumber of
yours

Tornham shoote the old man a look

TORNHAM
People warned me about employing a
squire who could read
(nedding at the parchment
on the desk)
(MORE )
TORNHAM (contd)
So what does King Richards
congratulatory letter have to do
with you packing up all my things

SQUIRE THOMAS
im afraid its a “good news bad
news” letter sir It seems you
are no longer the Sheriff of
Cyprus

Tornham looks at his Squire in confusion

TORNHAM
What Thats not possible
Richard appointed me for life
(angrily)
Give me that letter

The Squire pauses his packing hands Tornham the parchment --

SQUIRE THOMAS
Yes well that wae before he
decided to sell the Island and all
its contents and inhabitants to the
Knights Templar

Now Tornham’s confusion turns to total disbelief --

TORNHAM
He sold the island But we just
won a desperate victory over the

entire Army of Cyprus defending

this place for him

SQUIRE THOMAS
And dont think he doesn’t
appreciate it Thats where the
good news comes in

The Squire flips over the parchment and brings Tornham’s
attention to the writing at the bottom of the SECOND PAGE
which carries an EMBOSSED ROYAL SEAL

SQUIRE TROMAS (CONTD)
You Sir Rebert Tornham are no
longer Sheriff of Cyprus but
thanks to your well-proven loyalty

courage and resourcefulness - you
have just been appointed to be the
Sheriff of Nottingham

Tornham looks like someone just threw cold water on his face
He quickly reads over both pages of parchment for himself
He doesn’t look happy or sad just stunned

SQUIRE THOMAS
(rez packing it up)
I assume I‘11 find your chess set
in the privy

SMASH CUT TOs
EXT ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

T£ you can call it day between the grey CLOUDS and DRIZZLING
RAIN A PAIR OF HORSEMEN gallop their way down the muddy
remnant of a dirt ROAD it’s Tornham and Squire Thomas
both of their horses loaded down with SADDLEBAGS of food
clothing and books

SQUIRE THOMAS
(dry)
Merry old England Just as lovely
as I remembered it Aren’t you
glad to be home sir

TORNHAM
Do you know where the word
“Sarcasm” comes from Thomas

SQUTRE THOMAS
I believe from the Prench
BSALCASING o «6

TORNHAM
»sewho got it from the Latin
Sarcasmus -- which got it from the
Greek Sarkasmogs which got it
from the ancient Greek Sarkazein
Do you know what Sarkazein means in
ancient Greek Thomas

SQUIRE THOMAS
An ignorant squire such as myself
Of course not sir Please do
enlighten me

An awkward beat --

TORNHAM
Damn I can’t remember But were
nowhere near Greece anymore so if
you could lessen the amount of

SQUTRE THOMAS
Sarkazein
TORNHAM
It would be greatly appreciated

The two travellers reach the top of a RISE IN THE ROAD and an
URBAN LANDSCAPE becomes visible in the distance laid out
below them

NOTTINGHAM ENGLAND SEPTEMBER 1191
EXT SUBURBS OF NOTTINGHAM - DAY

The road becomes lined with scattered HOUSES which quickly
in turn give way to BIGGER MORE EXPENSIVE and CLOSERPACKED
HOUSES and TAVERNS The road here bears some TRAFFIC most
of it headed in the same direction as Tornham and Squire
Thomas NORTH towards a tall STONE WALL which looms in the
distance

Outside one of the Taverns an INN-KEEPER spots Tornham and
Squire Thomas as they approach smiles and CALLS OUT

INN-KEEPER
Good-day to you good-sirs Within
this establishment of mine you
shall find all manner of comforts
painted chambers and soft beds
piled so high with feather
Mattresses you can nearly touch the
ceiling with your finger Here is
your lodging for love affairs -
for you must trust me when I tell
you how sweetly becoming are those
lovely damsels who abide within

Squire Thomas inepects the Tavern -- several YOUNG WOMEN poke
their beads out of the windows some attractive some not
but all looking weary

TORNEAM
I assume you are familiar with the
“Diverse Ordinances and
Constitutions for the Regulation of
Horrible Sin® as enacted by our
late great King Henry II may God
bless his memory as he rests in
peace

INN-REEPER
(tentatively)
Mom I’ve heard of them
di

TORNHAM
So if we were to enter your
“establishment” we would find no
woman residing there whom you
charge more than fourteen pence a
week for her room

INNKEEPER
(nervously)
Those ordinances were a long time
ago Prices rise the value of
money falls You have to keep up
with the market

TORNHAM
Nonetheless I advise you to lower
the rent you charge in accordance
with the law of the land I’‘11
send a Bailiff by to check -- and
if you’re not in accordance to
levy the appropriate fines

Tornham turns his horse round and makes for the gate squire
Thomas confides to the Inn-Keeper —

SQUIRE THOMAS
Theres a new Sheriff in town

EXT NOTTINGHAM — MATIN GATES DAY

Tornham and Squire Thomas reach an OPEN pair of massive
WOODEN DOORS set in the STONE WALL which stretches around the
entire perimeter of the CITY

A steady stream of TWO-WAY TRAFFIC is passing in and out
under the watchful gaze of a pair of GUARDSMEN One of them
WAVES to Tornham and Squire Thomas

GUARDSMAN
Please identify yourselves
gentlemen

Tornham starts to reply but Squire Thomas jumps in first —

SQUIRE THOMAS
Sir Robert Tornham -- the newly
appointed Sheriff of Nottingham

The Guards exchange a look and dont seem convinced Tornham
reaches beneath his surcoat pulls out the PARCHMENT and
shows them the EMBOSSED ROYAL SRAL

SQUIRE THOMAS
I doubt you boys can read but I
have faith you can recognize the
Great Seal of King Richard -- can’t
you

The Guardemen’s eyes go wide and they quickly BOW their heads
to Tornham and gesture for him to pass - then one begins
ringing an ALARM BELL perched atop the gates -

SQUIRE THOMAS
I would advise us both to be
prepared for either a shower of
ciches or a surprise attack

Tornham and Squire Thomas ride on into the HEART OF THE CITY
It is a late 12th Century METROPOLIS and so far as English
aities go second only to London in its population
urbanization and sophistication

Before Tornham and Squire Thomas can get much further up the
MATIN ROAD they are suddenly SET UPON by a NOBLEMAN on
horseback accompanied by FOUR KNIGHTS all five horsemen
CHARGING their way through the CITY STREETS pulling their
mounts to a stop just in front of Tornham and his squire —-

The Nobleman -- intense eyes chiseled face and chiseled
body neds from atop his horse
NOBLEMAN

Sir Robert Tornham Sheriff of
Nottingham I presume I’ve been
axpecting you

(pulling his horse up

alongside Tornham

offering his HAND)
Guy of Gisborne I’ve been serving
as acting sheriff until a royal
appointment was made for the
office

TORNHAM
(SHAKING Gisborne’s hand)
Pleasure to meet you Sir Guy

GISBORNE (NOBLEMAN)
Pardon me for asking Sir Robert
but where is your escort Your
vretainars

Squire Thomas cleare his throat raises a hand —-

SQUIRE THOMAS
That would be me

Gisborne skeptically eyes the old man

GISBORNE

No offense Sir Robert -- but one

rusty man-at-arms Its insanity
There are murdering thieves hiding
behind every bush in England these
days -- especially along the Great
North Road which you took up from

London

Squire Thomas starts to reply but Tornham cuts him off -

TORNHAM
All no doubt leoking te ambush and
rob blind every Nobleman trotting
through the woods with an
impressive entourage and wagons
filled with treasure and fineries

(a beat)

Ive got one wagon coming with all
my belongings and the rest of my
retainers They should be here in
the next few days

Gisborne acknowledges this with a reluctant nod and indicates
an impregnable-looking CASTLE atop the hill at the center of
the city --

GISBORNE
Your office awaits you in
Nottingham Castle Castle Hill is
also the Norman section of the
city Youll want to stay close
after hours The Saxon section is

on Saint Mary’s Hill -- though
there’s not much “saintly” about
it

Gisberne continues with the guided TOUR he and his knights
leading Tornham and Squire Thomas on THROUGH THE cITy —-
PEASANTS and TOWNSFOLE LORDS and LADIES KNIGHTS and SERVANTS all
going through their daily routines

SQUIRE THOMAS

(chiming in)
I believe this town was founded by
some of my Saxon ancestors after
they invaded the island and wrested
great swathes of it from the
ancient Britons who inhabited it at
the time The Saxon chieftain in
this region was a man named Snot
and so this place was originally
named Snottingham

(WHISPERING to Tornham)
Sarkazein

Gisborne glares at the old Squire as Tornham suppresses a
grin --

TORNAHM
(to Gisborne)
What’s the population grown to
these days Sir Guy

GISBORNE
Two-thousand give or take Second
only to London according to the
latest census A few less recently
thanks to that bastard Hood

Tornham narrows his eyes --

TORNEAM
Who

GISBORNE
You havent heard of him Im
surprised The riff-reff have
started to compose ballads
celebrating his various crimes

TORNHAM
News from Nottingham doesn’t reach
all the way te Cyprus

GISBORNE
Hood Robin of Locksley before he
turned outlaw -- is a lesser

nobleman of Saxon descent whoa has
been robbing pillaging and now
murdering those of Noble birth and
Norman deacent for the last six
months The serfs and peasants
proclaim him some sort of rebel
champion

(MORE)
GISBORNE (contd)

A hero of the “common folk” because
he throws them a few pennies now
and again to keep theix mouths shut
as to his whereabouts

(shrugging)
And so long as he only kills
wealthy Normans the peasants and
townsfolk could care less They
blame his murders on the Jews -
though Ive yet to meet a Jew who
can shoot a strong bow well enough
to kill two people with one arrow
Speaking of which

Gisborne nods to a RUN-DOWN SECTION OF THE CITY a JEWISH
STAR painted on an old wooded sign nailed to a post marking
the neighborhood

GISBORNE
Saint Nicholas Lane --— the entrance
to the Jewish quarter

SQUIRE THOMAS
Gods chosen people

GISBORNE
More like God’s cursed Last year
they were burned out of York Most
of the survivors came to join their
brethren here They live piled
atop one another like rats

Tornham SEES a boardedup SYNAGOGUE in the distance and nods
to Gisborne

TORNHAM
Lf that’s the case why is their
synagogue boarded up

GISBORNE
rts only a few years old
Richards new law declared that
only those Jewish churches which
stood during his father’s reign
could remain open so we shut thie
one down People say they gather
to pray in their butcher shop now --
where It’s easy to slaughter
Christian children and collect
their blood

Tornham exchanges a look with his Squire

SQUIRE THOMAS
No gurprise there -- most of what
people say is nonsense

rest dismount -

TORNHAM
I‘d like to gee the bodies

GISBORNE
Excuse me

TORNHAM
The two you said were killed with
one arrow Tell me who raised the
hue and cry when they were first

discovered
An awkward moment of silence -- then Sir Guy confesses
GISBORNE
To be honest Sheriff --- I don’t

really know Does it matter

Tornham lets it slide and moves ons

TORNHAM
The scene of the murder then I711
have to gee that and anything

else you have relating to the
earlier murders ag well

GISBORNE
As you wish Still it seems a
waste to me Dead is dead and the
killer is known to all

TORNHAM
Right “Hood® formerly
Locksley Well I would
appreciate it nonetheless

Gisborne stares at Tornham for a moment then sighs —- and
smiles
GISBORNE

I’m actually quite happy to be

replaced you know Im a soldier

War is my vocation All this dealing

with law inquests evidence it’s

quite senseless to me

Gisborne nods BOWS to Tornham and marches off

INT CASTLE CHAMBER — DAY

Toxrnham and Squire Thomas light CANDLES and place them
throughout the large stone room

The DOOR suddenly swings OPEN and half-a-dozen LABORERS enter
carrying TWO LARGE SACKS --

Tornham and the old squire recoil from the SMELL —-

LABORER 1
Where’d ya‘ want ‘em Sheriff

Tornham POINTS to a LARGE WOODEN TABLE in the center of the
chamber

The Laborers sling both linen bags up onto the tables then
BOW and leave

Tornham and Squire Thomas quickly tie SCARFS around their
faces and approach the bags

SQUIRE THOMAS
Only twe bodies sir

Tornham node as Thomas takes out a SHEA OF PARCHMENTS and a
QUILL PEN and begins to WRITE as Tornham speaks

TORNHAM
Gisborne said there were three more
before thege -- each struck down
with a single arrow - but those

others have been buried in the
earth too long to be of use to

US se

Tornham unwraps BOTH BAGS -- revealing the still relatively
intact BODIES of the YOUNG MAN and YOUNG WOMAN Tornham
leans close carefully INSPECTING both corpses -

TORNHAM (CONTD)
They both have two wounds -- entry
and exit Which would probably
place them on top of one another at
the time of death

SQUIRE THOMAS
I can think of worse ways to end
one’s existence sir

TORNHAM
Don’t let a priest hear you say
that Thomas Our existence is not
supposed to end with death

Tornham SEES something on the Young Mans FACE -- a SUBSTANCE
which he carefully scrapes off with his fingernail and sets
aside in a SMALL BOWL He inspects the body of the Young
Woman finds some on her lifeless face as well

SQUIRE THOMAS
What’s that sir

TORNHAM
Beeswax
Tornham searches through the rest of the bags nothing
just the bodies
TORNHAM

Dammit Not a stitch of clothing
Or the arrow

SQUIRE THOMAS
They must have declared the murder
weapon a deodand --

TORNHAM
w a “donation to God and seld it
off to the highest bidder yes
And the clothes were probably
burned —-

SQUIRE THOMAS
To Keep their immortal souls from
getting stuck inside a tunic or
gown en route to heaven Happens
all the time -- or so the priests
would say

TORNHAM
(growing angry)

These fools didn’t bother to record
who discovered the bodies hold a
proper inquest or preserve any
evidence How are we to solve
these heinous crimes when all the
evidence is gone

SQUIRE THOMAS

Sir Guy didn’t seem to believe
there was anything to solve sir

frustration

Young Couple were killed

Gisborne in the lead --

GISBORNE
This is the place

Tornham and Squire Thomas dismount Gisborne watching from
atop his horse

GISBORNE (CONTD)
Tt’s been weeks Im sure the
tains have washed away all traces
of blood and gore if that is
what you hope to find

Tornham doesn’t reply Instead he carefully in
Ee

area especially the TRUNK of a large TRE
ground
GISBORNE
He hides in thege woods you know
TORNHAM
(eyes still on the tree
trunk)

Who
GISBORNE
Hood He has some four-score men
who follow him -- and they lurk
behind these very trees
camouflaged in Lincoln Green They
wait for unsuspecting fools to
provide them with sport then
disappear into the greenwood like
the moon on a cloudy night

CLOSE ON THE TREE TRUNK
A DEEP GASH visible in the bark

TORNHAM

The young lovers They were
impaled on this tree were they
not Heres the spot where the
arrow hit One arrow -- through
the back -- blood tissue bone
and it keeps going through more
flesh and bone out another back --—
imbedding in this tree

(chewing on his lip)
It would take at leagt a 150 pound
pull to penetrate all that And
definitely an armor-piercing bodkin -—
no standard arrow could do this And
the shooter would have to be close

GISBORNE
If you say so Sheriff My weapon
of choice is the sword

TORNHAM

(explaining)
An upright bow is accurate up to
400 yards but killing range is less
than half that Richard’s foot-
soldiers prefer more modern
crossbows but some still use this
traditional weapon I’ve seen it
often in France Italy and Cyprus —
though I’ve never been particularly
handy with a bow either My weapon
of choice is also the blade

Tornham motions for his squire --

TORNHAM
Thomas -- rope please

Squire Thomas nods quickly retrieves a BUNDLE of thin ROPE
from a saddlebag and HOLDS ONE END UP TO THE ARROW-GASH in
the tree-trunk Tornham estimates the ANGLE OF FIRE takes
the rope in his hands and WALKS OFF through the foliage
TRAILING THE ROPE TAUTLY BEHIND HIM as he Joes

Tornham keeps walking until his way is BLOCKED BY ANOTHER
TREE - roughly 75 YARDS away from the murder site

Gisborne turns to Squire Thomas

GISBORNE
What in God‘s name is he doing

SQUIRE THOMAS
Trying to discover exactly where
the murderer stood when he fired
the shot

Tornham turns and stares back through the foliage -- he has a
PERFECT SIGHT-LINE to the tree where the Young Couple were
killed Tornham rejoins Gisborne and Squire Thomas -

TORNHAM
(pointing to the Manorhouse)
Who lives there

GISBORNE
Lord Fitawater It was his party
the unfortunate young couple
wandered off from that night

TORNHAM
What was the occasion

GISBORNE
His daughter Marian She sits at
heme each night wasting her
beautiful young life away waiting
for her lover to return I believe
her father was trying to distract
her Remind ber there are other
birds iv the bush and bees in the
hive Encourage her to move on

TORNHAM
Whos the man who commands such
undying loyalty

GISBORNE
(tight)
Her lover was Robin of Locksley
Tornham and Squire Thomas exchange a look this is getting
more interesting by the moment

CRIPPLED YOUNG MAN using a fork to feed himself lunch

MADMAN HALEY
tearing at hie side more
forcefully)
God ripped me and every man asunder
in order to create you harlots

Understanding suddenly dawns on the Lady Volunteer’s face --

LADY VOLUNTEER
Ripped asunder You speak of
Adams rib

MADMAN HALEY
Of course On account of you we
are incomplete hollow and empty
inside

The Lady stares up at the Madman for a moment then calmly
smiles up at him

LADY VOLUNTEER
Shall J tell you what the reverend
master Peter Lombard a good son of
Adam and a great man indeed had to
say on this very same subject

MADMAN HALEY
“Lombard” Was he Italian I do
like Italian wine

LADY VOLUNTEER

(moving CLOSER and CLOSER

to him as she speaks)
Well it was his view that God made a
most perfect selection when he chose
Adams rib for the creation of Eve
God did not make woman from Adam’s
head for she was not intended to be
his ruler nor from his feet for she
was not intended to be his slave but
from his side for she was intended
to be his companion and his friend
Not to make him hollow and empty as
you claim but complete and whole
The final masterpiece of creation

By now the Lady is standing smack in front of the Madman on
top of the bed but his demeanor has changed and he remains
quite calm He ponders something for a moment then shakes
his head

MADMAN HALEY
Those Italians may know wine but
they dont know women
(going ice cold)

deserve to die

Madman Haley suddenly SNATCHES THE FORK out of the Crippled
Young Man’s hand and goes to STAB the Lady with it
24

But she manages to GRAB A PILLOW OFF THE BED and uses it to
BLOCK THE THRUST

The rest of the Inmates watch in shock and disbelief from
their beds as the Lady and the Madman FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL
for the fork --

A STRONG ARM SUDDENLY WRAPS ITSELF AROUND THE MADMAN’S NECK
AND YANKS HIM OFF THE LADY AND OFF THE BED —-

Its Tornham He holds Madman Haley flailing wildly in his
arm for a moment then POUNDS A FIST INTO THE BACK OF HIS
HEAD knocking him UNCONSCIOUS and lets him drop to the
floor

LADY VOLUNTEER
What bave you done

Without skipping a beat the Lady goes to Madman Haleys side
and examines him with gentle concern

TORNHAM
What have I done Milady are you

LADY VOLUNTEER
T am not your lady and I do not
appreciate your “heroic rescue” Now
come help me get this poor man back
into his bed

Tornham does as he’s told and together he and the Lady carry
the Madman over to his empty bed and lay him down on it ‘The
‘Lady instantly starts tending to Madman Haleys self-
inflicted WOUND using clean water balm and bandages

LADY VOLUNTEER
He has for some time been fallen
out of his right mind and T assure
you that beating on bim like an
animal will not restore his wits

TORNHAM
It was not his wits I was concerned
with restoring but your safety
Ma’am Forgive me if I have
offended you but I believe most men
in my position would have been far
less merciful and run the maniac
through with their sword

LADY VOLUNTEER
On the road or in the forest
perhaps but not in a hospital
(MORE)
LADY VOLUNTEER (contd)
There are different rules of
behavior here

The Lady suddenly lifts her eyes from the Madman’s wounds and
really looks at Tornham for the firat time

LADY VOLUNTEER
Do I know you

Tornham looks back at her

TORNHAM
No
LADY VOLUNTEER
(turning her eyes back to
the patient)
Good

Tornham stands there rather uncomfortably aware of being
watched by all the other Inmates while the Lady volunteer
keeps tending to the unconscious Madman ‘Tornham clears his
throats

TORNHAM
Ma’am you do not know me but I am
in fact here to see you

LADY VOLUNTEER
Are you destitute

TORNHAM
No
LADY VOLUNTEER
Crippled
TORNHAM
(anneyed)
No

LADY VOLUNTEER
Tl -- but without means to afford
a learned doctors care

TORMHAM

No

LADY VOLUNTEER
Then I am afraid we have no
facility to serve you
TORNAHAM

MARTAN (LADY VOLUNTEER)
How did you guess

TORNHAM

I was told you are most uncommonly
devoted to your work

Tornham watches as Marian tends with a SPADE to a large

GARDEN on the Hospital grounds Its filled with flower
beds fruit trees vegetables and herbs -

TORNHAM

Your garden is beautiful
MARTIAN

Thank you
TORNEBAM

And no doubt totally unappreciated
by the lunatics inside

Marian shoots him a look pissed

MARTIAN

But it is well appreciated by the
great majority of patients who are
not mad but simply poor and
homeless - and even the mad
appreciate the power of the
medicinal herbs to lessen their
affliction

Please ask your questions and go

Tornham bites back some bile proceeds
TORNHAM

Im told the Hospital staff here
dips their own candles

MARTAN
(nodding)
Ido it It’s much cheaper that
way - as long as you know what

youre doing Though I don’t gee
why it would be of concern to you

TORNHAM

Its been my experience that during
criminal inquiries such small
details invariably help reveal that
which would otherwise remain
hidden

(a beat)
You are a friend of the outlaw
Robin Hood known in his previous
life as Sir Robin of Locksley

MARTIAN
Is that a question

TORNHAM
No Maam its a etatement of fact -
ig it not

MARTAN
Not quite Im actually his
fiancee

Tornham tries to hide his surprise -- but fails

MARTAN (CONT D)
We were just about to marry when he
was unjuetly outlawed

(MORE)
MARIAN (CONTD)

We decided to postpone the marriage
until his good name is exonerated
and his lands and titles restored
by good King Richard

(a beat)
It was Robins idea He wanted to
wait until he could provide a
normal life for us -- be a proper
-husband

TORNHAM
8o youre waiting for Richard to
return from the crusades Do not
hold your breath

Marian shoots him anether look

MARTIAN
Clearly you know nothing of love
Sheriff Of the sacrifices a
person can make in ite name

Tornham shrugs

TORNHAM
I know a good deal about love
but what I love is justice And I
am prepared to make sacrifices in
its name

Marian keeps glaring up at the Sheriff -

MARTAN
IT have to go
(standing up)
My patients need me

TORNHAM
You say he was “unjustly” outlawed

MARTAN
He came to the defenge of a miller
whe had killed one of the kings deer
to feed his starving family The
miller was executed and Robin
sentenced to be blinded for having
defended him He fled to the forest

TORNHAM
And began taking his revenge upon
the Nobles who ruined his
privileged life by hunting them
the way the miller hunted the
kings deer

(MORE)
TORNHAM (contd)

Marian doesn’t reply -- instead she turns and heads back
inside the hospital Tornham just watches her go and
sighs She is quite beautiful

Gisborne smiles at Tornham -- “I told you so”
Tornham takes a deep breath Turns to Squire Thomas tense --

TORNHAM

The old man shrugs apolegetically

SQUIRE THOMAS
ZI um I thought it was less
likely to be Jost or damaged if TI

Tornham nods Tries to get control of his anger

TORNHAM
(to his men)
Anyone besides Jack injured

The Retainers exchange looks shake their heads Tornham
turns to Gisborne

TORNHAM

A COMMOTION has begun People are GATHERING and a palpable
EXCITEMENT is in the air and now we see what it’s about

A vast PROCESSION is approaching the outskirts of the city --
it‘s a ROYAL HOUSEHOLD travelling on HORSEBACK and in WAGONS
everything from COOKS and BUTLERS to PRIESTS and COUNSELORS
carrying their packed-—up kitchens beds desks and documents
with them all watched over by a atrong force of FOREIGN
MERCENARY KNIGHTS Up at the very front a HERALD announces

HERALD
MAKE WAY FOR HIS GRACE PRINCE JOHN)

PRINCE JOHN wears a modest crown on his head and a well-
trimmed beard on his youthful 25 year-old face He is one of
the most powerful men in England and not at all bad looking --
but bitterness and insecurity fi11 most of the space where

his confidence should be He flashes insincere smiles at his
gathering SUBJECTS as they WAVE and CHEER and CALL HIM BY
NAME -- though when the Subject in question is an attractive
woman or girl his smile grows more heartfelt

Riding beside John is ELEANOR OF AQUITAINE who has
remained THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND despite the fact that her son
Richard -- the absent King -- is married to a queen of his
own At age 72 she is still strikingly attractive and an
excellent horsewoman

Prince John grins at his mother

PRINCE JOHN
Do you hear them Can anyone
dispute that I am loved by my
people

QUEEN ELEANOR
Love is a fine thing my son -- but
swords are more dependable castles
more defensible and gold more
easily transferable

SMASH CUR’ TOs
EXT FOREST DAWN

A sun-dappled GLADE deep in the greenwood The same powerful
STAG present at the double-murder scene cautiously emerges
from behind a wall of trees and bushes He cocks his head
with their huge antlers and listens for a moment -- then
RACES OFF AT TOP SPEED deeper into the forest

The PIERCING NOTE OF and HORN echees amongst the trees

then a PACK OF BLOODHOUNDS comes CHARGING after the Stag
BARKING LIKE MAD

and a half-dozen HORSEMEN COME CRASHING out of the trees

the most powerful NOBLE MEN and WOMEN from his household and
the Nottingham area including Guy of Gisborne Sheriff

force of ROYAL GUARDS

The Stag pauses where several THICK OAKS have been uprooted
by storms and formed a FOREST CAVE complete with a narrow
shadowy entrance

Prince John leads the hunt deeper into the woods at full tilt --
EXT DEEPER IN THE FOREST - DAY

The PACK OF HOUNDS reach the FALLEN OAK CAVE and freeze in
their tracks SNIFFING around the shadowy entrance

Prince John and his hunting party gallop up and rein in their
horses A moment later the DOG KEEPERS arrive on foot --

DOG KEEPER
The hounds have him Your Grace

PRINCE JOHN
(smiling to his fellow
hunters)
Question is -- which of we noble
hounds will have bis bleod

Prince John draws a paix of DANISH THROWING AXES from hig
saddle DISMOUNTS and carefully approaches the Oak Cave The
other Noblemen all draw axes spears or bows and dismount as
well
GISBORNE
Take care Your Grace A cornered
beast ie the most dangerous of all
PRINCE JOHN
True Sir Guy But no beast has
escaped my axes yet

SUDDENLY SOMETHING CRASHES QUT OF THE OAK CAVE not the
Stag but a WILD BOAR who uses the cave as his lair

The Boar CHARGES STRAIGHT AT PRINCE JOHN

The Prince freezes in fear ——
-- but Tornham RUSHES OVER and IMPALES the beast on his
SPEAR

The huge Boar struggles ferociously YANKING the spear OUT OF
TORNHAM‘S GRASP and GOES FOR JOHN AGAIN -

but just before he is upon the Prince another member of
the Hunting Party LAUNCHES AN ARROW STRAIGHT BETWEEN THE
BOAR’S EYES KILLING HIM INSTANTLY

The archer ie Lady Marian

Everyone breathes a huge sigh of relief as the boar collapses
in a heap

Prince John steadies his nerves -- then forces a thankful
grin to Marian and Tornham

PRINCE JOHN
Lady - six My deepest thanks

Queen Eleanor and the other Lady Hunters ride up The Queen
quickly takes in the scene

QUEEN ELEANOR
Are you all right John

John struggles to keep his anger in check -

PRINCE JOHN
Never better thank you mother

Prince John SUDDENLY DRAWS HIS SWORD AND HACKS AWAY at the
dead boar aplattering himself with blood He wipes his face
sheathes his sword and RAISES UP THE BOARS DECAPTTATED HEAD -

PRINCE JOHN
A fine trophy indeed
(to Marian)
far you milady

MARTAN
Thats very kind of you Your Grace
but ET couldnt really The walls of my
father’s home are already crowded with

Tornham)

PRINCE JOHN (contd)
Then you Sir Robert -- a freshly-
butchered beast for a freshly-
appointed sheriff What could be
more fitting

Tornham stands there uncomfortably for a long moment all
eyes on him -- then decides to “go with the flow of blood” so
to speak takes the head from Prince Johns bloody hands
smiles humbly and bows

TORNHAM
Iocan’t think of a thing Your
Grace

PRINCE JOHN
Good

(glancing at all the dead
Boars)
Now as my mother knows well I
always choose venison over pork —-
so the hunt must go on

watching over the HUNTING PARTY as its honored members relax
and recover from their strenuous activity The honored
guests are WATTED ON by SERVANTS who busy themselves ROASTING
and SERVING choice cuts of freshly killed game

A tall brawny KINGS FORESTER clad in leather and animal
hides IMPALES the severed BOAR’S HEAD atop a SHARPENED STAKE
A moment later Prince Jchn emerges from the Lodge having
exchanged his blood-drenched clothes for fresh and even more
stylish garments

John approaches the Forester who bows his head and steps
away leaving John to stare into the DEAD EYES of the severed
Boar‘’s Head John spots Tornham in the crowd and gestures to
him Tornham approaches

PRINCE JOHN
Walk with me Sheriff
Tornham falls in beside the Prince as he makes hia way

through the HUNTING CAMP smiling and waving to his GUESTS as
he goes

PRINCE JOHN
Tell me Sir Robert -- why do you
think you are the Sheriff of
Nottingham

TORNHAM
(slightly confused)
Because your brother the King
chose me

PRINCE JOHN

Wrong

a beat)
God stays in heaven and the bevil
in hell and a king of England
cannot rule his kingdom from Cyprus
oc Jerusalem You are Sheriff
because I choose to let you be
You have some reputation as an able
man of both action and intellect
IT have heard you share my own
interest in administration and law
unlike my brother -- whose
interests as you must know are
limited to war and poetry Make
yourself useful to me today while
I rule England in his absence and
there is no limit to what may be in
store for you tomorrow

John gives Tornham an affectionate slap on the back then
spots an ATTRACTIVE NOBLEWOMAN amongst the guests turns from
Tornham and makes a bee-line to embrace her

fornham GLANCES AROUND spots Marian speaking with the King’s
Forester by the impaled Boar’s Head ‘Tornham walks over —

TORNBAM
Remarkable shot Did Locksley

The King’s Forester glares at Tornham

KINGS FORESTER

King’s Forester

TORNHAM

Lucky for His Grace Prince John

KINGS FORESTER
(with concern RE the
gathered Royal panoply)
I hope you don’t plan on this party
lasting past sunset

TORNHAM
Im well aware of the security
issues involved We shall be gone
long before then

KINGS FORESTER

HUGH gives Tornham a curt nod of deference and marches off

MARTAN
Archerys not the only thing Im
good at Sheriff

Tornham watches Marian stride over to where he horse is
tethered unfasten its reins and MOUNT UP -—-

MARIAN (CONT’D)
I’m also quite the horsewoman

With that Marian spurs her horse and GALLOPS AWAY from the
Hunting Party past the Royal Escorts and off into the
FOREST

Tornham frantically MOUNTS UP on his own HORSE and GALLOPS
AFTER HER -

MARTAN

vides DEEPER AND DERPER INTO THE WOODS all alone -- until
Ternham catches up with her

TORNBAM
Lady Marian I dont know what
you’re doing but thats enough of
itl We must turn round and return
to the Hunting Lodge

MARTAN
Must we I know Sherwood as well
as I know my father’s house

SUDDENLY THE STAG LEAPS OUT FROM BEHIND SOME BUSHES then
takes off at a dead run

MARIAN
There

Marian CHARGES her horse after the buck

Tornham races his horse after her trying to catch up -- but
shes got a head start and she knows these woods better than
he does ZIGGING and ZAGGING her way through the trees
bearing down on the deer

Tornham starts to fall behind only CATCHING GLIMPSES of
Marian through the thick foliage as she gallops after the
deer -

He CRASHES through a tangle of HEAVY BRANCHES and suddenly
reigns his horse to a stop --

Marian is gone

TORNHAM
Damn

Tornham lets out a eigh of frustration RIDES DEEPER INTO THE
WOODS searching for any sign of Marian or the Hunting
Party o

Still nothing

And now hes coming to the realization that he’s lost

He reins in his horse curses under his breath then cups
his hands to his lips and CALLS OUT

TORNHAM
MARIAN

No reply
Tornham raises his HUNTING HORN to his lips to blow a signal --

AN ARROW

Tornham spins his horse around in shock and surprise and goes
for hig sword --

but ANOTHER ARROW CLEAVES THE SADDLE-STRAP OFF THR BELLY OF
HIS HORSE sending him SLIDING HARD TO THE GROUND losing his
gcip on hie sword as his horse NEIGHS in fright and GALLOPS OFF
into the woods

Stunned Tornham pulls himself to his feet searches the
ground for his sword -- then freezes Hears something
RUSTLING amongst the trees

SUDDENLY a pack of HOODED and MASKED MEN in GREEN and BROWN
come LEAPING DOWN AT TORNHAM FROM OUT OF THE TREES ABOVE

Tornham starts RUNNING through the woods the HOODED MEN
CHASING AFTER HIM

Tornham SPRINTS as fast as he can suddenly skide to a halt
as ANOTHER PACK OF HOODED MEN EMERGE FROM AMIDST THE TREES IN
FRONT OF HIM cutting off his escape

He SPINS and TEARS OFF in yet another direction the two
bands of Hooded Men JOINING up and CHASING AFTER him

Tornham suddenly FALLS THROUGH THE GROUND into a DEADFALL
PIT -- a DEEP HIDDEN HOLE covered over with broken branches
and gragg

The pack of Hooded Men -- their faces CAMOUFLAGED with dry
mud and lime -- converge on the deadfall gripping swords and
axes

SUDDENLY TORNHAM’S HAND STABS UP OUT of the pit grabs one
of the Hooded Men by the ankle and YANKS him into the hole

Tornham is CLINGING PRECARIOUSLY to the edge of the pit with
one hand and using the other to GRAB another startled Hooded
Man and DRAG him down into the pit also Tornbam PULLS
HIMSELF out of the hole and KNOCKS A THIRD HOODED MAN into
the pit before his remaining enemies CONVERGE on him —

Tornham is outnumbered but fights like a professional
soldier DODGING their sword thrusts looking for his opening
and taking it using his hands as BRUTAL WEAPONS breaking
NOSES bruising THROATS snapping WRISTS and ARMS with
violent efficiency

Tornham suddenly SEES something - its his horse lese than
50 yards away standing there confused

Tornham raises two fingers to his lips WHISTLES —-

The HORSE starts to GALLOP towards Tornham —

Tornham POUNDS ACROSS THE FOREST FLOOR RUNNING AS FAST AS HE
CAN tewards his approaching borse glancing back over hia

shoulder to see he ig again being CHASED BY THE REMAINING
HOODED MEN
39

Tornham reaches his horse LEAPS onto itss bare back grabs
the reins spins the animal around and RIDES AWAY from the
Hooded Men GALLOPING OFF to safety --

just as AN ARROW SUDDENLY WHISTLES THROUGH THE AIR AND
BARELY MISSES HIM)

But the arrow wasn’t aimed at him and goes on to HIT ITS
TARGET by SLICING THROUGH A ROPE attached to some sort of
RIGGING up in the branches -

-- which RELEASES a HUGE LOG hidden in the trees above and
SENDS IT SWINGING RIGHT FOR TORNHAM —

-- who is KNOCKED RIGHT OFF HIS HORSE by the SWINGING LoG—
TRAP He FLIES BACKWARDS THROUGH THE AIR and LANDS HARD on
the ground

fornham -- barely conscious the wind knocked out of him
stares up at the TREES and SPIES a Hooded Man perched on a
branch with a STRONG-BOW in his hands

The Hooded Man looks down at the bruised and battered
Tornham then THROWS BACK HIS HOOD revealing a strikingly
handsome FACE lips spread in a ROGUISH SMILE

HOODED MAN
Welcome to Sherwood

Just before losing consciousness Tornham realizes that this
good-looking and gleeful fellow can only be one man --

TORNHAM
(barely audible)
Locksley ««

Tornhams eyes roll up inte his head and everything GorS
BLACK

HOLD FOR A MOMENT

Then the WHISTLING SOUND which we now recognize as an ARROW
piercing the air

SMASH CUT TOs
CLOSE ON TORNHAM
as his eyes SNAP OPEN - just in time to SEE the ARROW coming

straight at him -- then BARELY MISSING HIM thudding into a
tree behind his head just inches from his face

EXT OUTLAW CAMP DUSK

Tornham has awoken to find himself BOUND TO A MASSIVE TREE
TRUNK arms stretched out at the shoulders tied there like
Christ on the Cross his entire body surrounded by the
JUTTING SHAFTS AND FEATHERED VANES OF DOZENS OF ARROWS

THIRTY YARDS AWAY the now un-hooded Hooded Men -- who are of
course the MERRY MEN -— are DRINKING EATING LAUGHING
PLAYING DICE and using Tornham for target practice with
their bows and arrows

HOOD (HOODED MAN)
Good of you to join us Sheriff

Tornham watches tensely as ROBIN HOOD notches an arrow on his
string drawe the bow aims and fires -- sending it SOARING
STRAIGHT AT HIM

The arrow hits dead center on its target eliciting
UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER from the ranks of Merry Men it has
Lodged in a NARROW STRIP OF BARK visible between Tornham’s
legs tiust below his crotch

HOOD
(NOTCHING another arrow)
Lucky it’s not me up there -- my
cock wouldve just lost near half
its length

The laughter DOUBLES

MERRY MAN
That’e not what I heard Robin

Hoop
From your sister eh

The laughter TRIPLES as Robin Hood shoots his arrow this

bead

Tornham struggles against his bonds but it’s no use - he
can’t budge an inch

HOOD
Relax Sheriff From the dungeon
of Sherwood there is no escape

Bloodied bruised and humiliated Tornham narrows his eyes
and speaks slowly deliberately

TORNHAM
Te Want my chess-set

A confused look between Robin and his men

HOOD
Your what

Tornham grits hie teeth tense

TORNHAM
My chess-set I want my chess—set
back

Robin Hood raises an eyebrow in disbelief --
HOOD

Is that all you can think of at a
time like this

TORNHAM
Iwant my bloody chess-set back

Silence - until both Robin and the Merry Men ERUPT in
LAUGHTER

Robin Hood carefully notches ANOTHER ARROW --

HOOD
You must be quite the player

- then FIRES SPLITTING THE HAIRS ATOP TORNHAM’S HEAD

TORNHAM
You sir are a brigand thief and
murderer - and I swear before God
almighty and your ragged mob that
you shall be brought to justice

MORE LAUGHTER rolls from the Merry ranks Robin Hood marches
up to Tornham and proceeds to retrieve his arrows from the
tree around the bound Sheriff

HOOD
(to his men)
Has got nerve does he not
(to Tornham)
Til tell you about “justice
Sheriff I was outlawed without
CAUSE
(MORE)

HOOD (contd)
All the land T held as a loyal
tenant of the King the land my
father held and his father before
him -- all was forfeit and taken by
Prince John and every possession I
owned sold off and every half-penny
of profit pocketed by that
tyrannical bastard

TORNHAM
If you were unjustly outlawed you
should have lodged a plea in court

HOOD
With Guy of Gisborne overseeing the
inquest Id sooner be tried in
hell by a jury of the damned with
Lucifer himeelf age Judge

Tornham shakes his heads

TORNHAM
You were a noble T£ you doubted
the fairness of the court here in
Nottingham you could have taken
your plea all the way to the King’s
Court of Justice at Westminster in
London

For the first time since we met him a serious look fills
Robin Hoods faces

HOOD

The courts be damned They
administer Norman justice for those
of pure Norman blood When a lowly
Saxon such as myself -

(GESTURING to his Men)
- of one of my men is involved
justice is banished from court

MERRY MEN (VARTOUS)
Aye -- Thets no joke and right --

Tornham looks ab the crowd of green and brown-clad woodsmen
then back at their leader

TORNHAM
SO you wrap your murder and robbery
in a blood-soaked flag of
vebellion Tell me -- Earl of
Locksley -- do you know anyone of
“pure” Norman blood I dont
(MORE)
TORNHAM (contd)
Norman and Saxon have been
enthusiastically inter-breeding
their bloed for more than a
century Youre stuck in the past
“Robin Hood” - were all English
now

Robin Hood glares at the Sheriff -- then DRAWS HIS SWORD and
POINTS IT at Tornhams THROAT

HOOD
Lots of Norman blood in those veins
of yours -- eh Sheriff

Tornham’s eyes blaze with defiance

TORNHAM
Go ahead Murder a helpless
prisoner I would expect no less
from the likes of you

Robin Hood flashes a rather charming grin --

HOOD
Serry to digappoint you then

-- and uses his sword to CUT THE ROPES binding Tornham to the
tHe

HOOD (CONT ’D)
tT didn’t bring you here to kill you -
ox even for the high-price in gold
you would earn in ransom I brought
you here to tell you that though I am
indeed guilty of many things Im not
the murderer you seek

(shrugging)
Now I’ve got to cover your face so
you can’t come back to kill me
Stick to your castle of stone and
leave us to ours of bark and branch
Tornham cubs hia raw wrists contemplates attacking Robin
right then and there - but there are far too many of the
outlaw’s men surrounding all around Instead he locks eyes
with Hoods

TORNEAM
The law doesn’t end at the edge of
the forest

Robin Hood’s perpetual emile disappears replaced with a grim
intensity

A STEADY DRIZZLE starts raining down on the forest
Robin Hood slips on his Hoop

HOOD
Yours does

Robin Hood nods to a HULKING WOODSMAN - the biggest of a
rather big bunch He steps up COVERS Tornhams eyes with a
BLINDFOLD takes him by the shoulders and starts leading him

away - but Tornham stops short --
TORNHAM

Robin Hood turns pissed

HOOD
My name is Robin Hood

TORNHAM
(shrugging)
Whatever you call yourself
(with an edge)
Lady Marian Fitewater is not of

Robin smoulders He calls to the Hulking Woodsman
HOOD
Little John take him back where he
belongs -- and don’t hurt him en the

After a few moments a thin SLOT on the heavy wooded

Tornham with a BEAMING SMILE

LORD FITZWATER (OLD MAN)
Well by all means good gir a

Marriage perhaps

Tornham smiles back at the Old Man

INT MARIAN’S BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

Marian site in her bed wearing a 12th Century nightgown
She has an open MANUSCRIPT in her lap and is JOTTING NOTES in

the MARGINS with a QUILL PEN as she READS

Tornham SUDDENLY THROWS OPEN the door marches in
guickly wraps a BLANKET over her nightgown

MARTAN
Sherif£ What are you doing here
We feared you were lost or killed
OL

TORNHAM
Betrayed

Marian

MARIAN
T have no idea what youre -

TORNHAM
(in her face)
You led me into Robin Hood’s hands
like a lamb to the slaughter

Marian is speechless for a moment Then regains her
composure and speaks curtly -

MARTAN
That’s ridiculous Is it my fault
that you couldn’t keep up I am
just a woman after all
(a beat)
Tell me did you learn anything
during your time in the forest

TORNHAM
Such as

MARIAN
That Robin of Locksley is not the
killer you seek

TORNHAM
Really He nearly killed me

MARIAN
“Nearly” Sheriff So you made a
heroic escape from his evil clutches

Tornham hesitates for an uncomfortable moment then answers

TORNHAM

Not exactly
MARTAN

Tosee I take it that means if he

wanted you dead you would be
TORMBAM

(tight)
He will Live to regret passing up

the chance to kill me today It
wont come again

Tornham notices for the first time that Marian’s hair is down
loose around her shoulders then eyes the MANUSCRIPT in her
bands
Al

TORNHAM
What’s that youre reading

Marian narrows her ayes at Tornham caught a bit off-guard by
his interest

MARTIAN
A new telling of “Tristan and
Isolde” by a Frenchman named
Beroul

TORNHAM
Beroul’s only original contribution
to the ancient tale is to have
Tristan kill Godwin with an arrow
through the eye -- the way your
fiancee would have done it

Marian glares at him

MARTAN
IT haven’t gotten that far in the
story

TORNHAM
Sorry Didn’t mean to ruin the
ending

Marian shrugs back at him

MARTIAN
I believe the love triangle between
Sir Tristan Lady Isolde and her
busband the King is a metaphor for
our own spiritual struggle - the
choice between duty and pasgion

Tornham thinks on that one for a moment then notices the
writing in the margins and steps closer to Marian --

TORNBAM
Whet’s this

MARTIAN
(self-consciously)
My notes Alternate Lines
commentaries critiques of the
text I myself write on occasion
Poetry
48

TORNHAM
(impressed)
King Richard writes poetry in his
firet language -- Provencal

MARIAN
Is it any good

Tornham carefully weighs his answer

TORNTAM
Pasgable at best But if you tell
anyone I said it’s less than genius
Ill probably be executed for
treason

Marian can’t help but smiles

MARTIAN
So it seems I hold your life in
my hands Sheriff

Tornham looks from Marians words to her eyes She looks
back The silence between them grows intense then

TORNHAM
My name is Robert
(a beat)
Do you ever let anyone read your
poetry

MARIAN
No But you must remember most of
the people around here can’t read

TORNEAM
What about Locksley Can he read

MARTIAN
We reads my heart

Tornham nods thinks this over

TORNHAM
You told me Id be dead if he
wanted me so I tell you he
doesn’t know what he wants -- other
than to serve his own pride

They keep staring at each other -

but the moment ig broken by the LOUD SOUNDS OF BRLLS

Tornham takes a STORM-LANTERN from the CROWD and holds it
over the corpse of a well-dressed MAN in his 40s sprawled
on his back eyes wide open face contorted in agony blood
everywhere -- an ARROW jutting out of his throat

TORNHAM

Still fresh

When did you last see him alive

SERF
After the mid-day meal but before
the church-bells sound for Vespers

Tornham hands the storm-lantern to Squire Thomas takes a RAG
from his pocket and carefully proceeds to PULL the arrow out
of the man’s neck Gisborne eyes the bloody arrow

GISBORNE
“LeGriff” - a proud Norman name

Tornham looks down from the arrow to the dead man’s face -
then scoops a few traces of BEESWAX off the man’s lifeless
cheeks shows it to Squire Thomas

TORNHAM
The bees have been busy

Squire Thomas WHISPERS to Tornham

SQUIRE THOMAS
At least you got here before they
could sell the arrow

Tornham WRAPS the arrow in the rag hands it to Thomas takes
back the storm-lantern looks over the body again then
begins INSPECTING the riverbank the Lantern ILLUMINATING the
wet shadowy area

GISBORNE
You’re aware the law states that
whatever district is home to foul
play must be summarily fined

TORNHAM
fts a foolish law

GISBORNE
On the contrary -- it deters people
from thinking they can get away
with murder

TORNHAM
Why punish an entire community for
the act ef one man We face
special circumstances in this case
After all -- as you Sir Guy will
be first to argue everyone knows
Robin Hood resides in Sherwood
forest not in the neighborhood of
Trent Bridge

Gisborne fumes -- but nods his head in grudging acceptance

few children a few old and infirm
villagers Motive to hate the
Royals perhaps but not the ability
to murder them

TORNHAM (contd)
These were longbow killings It
takes strength and accuracy to kill
someone that way So I’m stumped
And since you are the expert archer
in these parts I thought maybe --

Tornham watches confused as Robin takes a swig of ALE

TORNBAM

met the right woman Why

Robin turns his gaze from the arrowheads to Marian who
continues tending to his men

chews grinning --

PRINCE JOHN

Oh don’t be coy Sheriff Ive
seen the way you look at the woman

The first time is always the best --
particularly when its against her
will You know once Hood is
executed your path to her bed will
be free of obstruction And
theres no way old Man Fitzwater
would turn down a proposal from the
kingdom’s next Chief Justiciar eh

Tornham looks at Prince John a thousand things running
through his head Then --

TORNHAM
Your Highness the execution you
speak of must be preceded by a
trial Trial by Jury is the only
way to establish a clear and honest
record Hood is very popular here
in Nottingham But if he is proven
guilty of these murders on the
strength of the evidence no one
will mourn bis death If we
execute him without benefit of
trial we run the risk of creating a
martyr for those you spoke of
the ones waiting to raise the
bloody flag of rebellion against
you

Prince John stares at Tornham for a moment then shakes
his head

PRINCE JOHN
I see your point Sheriff -- but
trials are notoriously uncertain
proceedings I have no desire to
place such a sensitive matter in

A mixture of GASPS and CHEERS from the crowd

Gisborne STABS down at the prostrate figure of his enemy but
before the tip of the blade hits home Robin KICKS OUT a foot
and TRIPS up Gir Guy and he goes crashing down into the mud
next to Hood -

The two empty-handed warriors struggle up to their knees with

Six Guys surceat and the chainmail armor beneath TEARING

through the “Golden Cups insignia and CUTTING A JAGGED SLICE

Another CHEER goes up among the Peasants and Serfs -- but the
cheers suddenly catch in their throats as Gisborne expertly
WHIPS the spike-covered steel ball at the end of his flail
around Robins blade and gives it a powerful YANK - RIPPING
the sword from Robins grip and FLINGING it off to the other
side of the courtyard -

Gisborne PRESSES HIS ATTACK sending the spiked iron ball
WHACKING into Robins shield over and over the shield
starting to SPLINTER and break apart --

Now the Nobles are CHEERING -- but their cheers suddenly stop
short as Robin ducks low slings off his shield grips it in
his hands like a battering ram and CHARGES at Gisborne --

The sharp point of the battered shield STABS hard into
Gisbornes armored stomach sending his stumbling backwards
to the ground the ball and chain slipping from his grasp --

leader into the mud with him

Both men frantically struggle to regain their feet in the

each other with fists STABBING elbows into necks SMASHING
forearms against kidneys DRIVING knees into groins
delivering blow after devastating blow

The two battered warriors finally wrestle each other to the
ground slipping and sliding covering themselves in mud

Gisborne manages to get Robin in a head-lock and FORCES the
outlaw’s head towards a4 DEEP PUDDLE

Gisborne holds on a moment longer then finally releases his

He focusee on the hand
TORNHAM
(barely audible)

Marian

But the gloved hand belongs to Eleanor of Aguitaine

QUEEN ELEANOR
Sorry to disappoint you

fornham narrows his eyes at the Queen - then slowly
painfully pulls himself into a sitting position in the bed

TORNHAM
Forgive me your Highness
liv

QUEEN ELEANOR
No apologies necessary Sheriff
You have been overcome by your
wounds for several days That’s
more than enough excuse for
anything you might have said to
offend my Royal sensibilities

Tornham notices that Eleanor is holding a DAGGER in her
gloved hand - the one Prince John cut off his royal garments
with

TORNHAM
80 who is our King

QUEEN ELEANOR
Richard rules England once more
Ne small thanks to you

Tornham notices a few FLIES beginning to buzz around the
dagger

TORNHAM
And what of Gisborne

QUEEN ELEANOR

Sir Guy is dead The people say
that the brave and unjustly accused
outlaw Robin Hood took his
vengeance on the murderer Sir
Guy -- putting two arrows into
him and also wounding Prince
Johns tyrannical tax collecting
lackey the Sheriff of Nottingham

(a dry smile)
That is after brave Sir Robin
discovered Gisborne’s hidden
sanctum of horrors and helped the
rightful King Richard regain his
Castle

Sornham smiles with bitter amusement

TORNBAM
He seems to have done it all this
Robin of Locksley

QUEEN ELEANOR
Yes He’s quite the hero
(a beat)
People need heroes Sir Robert
(MORE)
QUEEN ELEANOR (contd)

Men like yourself steeped in law
and arithmetic help a kingdom to
function properly but the kingdom
itself would not exist without men
like my Richard -- and your Robin
of Locksley They are the sort who
will make men proud to be English --
the way Charlemagne and Roland made
them proud to be French

Eleanor takes out the DEATH-LIST that Tornham found in
Gisborne’s sanctum She strolls over to the fireplace
tosses the Death-List into the flames and watches the
parchment BURN

TORNHAM
(quietly)
What did the victims all have in
common Your Highness Were they
all supporters of Richard

Eleanor raiges an eyebrow at Tornham clearly impreseed

TORNHAM (CONTD)
Gisborne was just following orders
wasn’t he Doing Prince John’s
bidding

QUEEN ELEANOR
Do not mourn for Gisborne The man
was a beast

TORNEAM
Who is worge Your Highness A mad
dog -- or the master who knowingly
sets that dog to prey on innocent
victims

QUEEN ELEANOR
My little boys actions were
regrettable yes But he is of
Royal blood -— and his mistakes no
matter how bad must not be allowed
to taint the throne And ag for
who is “innocent” I suggest you
leave that to God

Rleanor studies the wounded Sheriff for a moment -- then
steps to his bedside and leans in close the dagger still
clutched in her hand --

QUEEN ELEANOR (CONTD)

(a tight WHISPER)
You know Sir Guy didn’t die in the
woods Sheriff He was still alive
when the both of you were found He
was brought back to the Royal
Physicians but they were powerless
to do anything except watch him
expire

The Sheriff etares as MORE FLIES land on the dagger -- a
slight BLOODSTAIN visible on the blade as it catches a sliver
of moonlight

TORNHAM
And what isa my fate to be Your
Highness

Eleanor studies the Sheriff for a moment then gently
KISSES hie forehead and rises

QUEEN ELEANOR
As you well know the people have
nothing left to tax and times are
very hard -- even for the Nobility
The only way Richard will be able to
vaise funds sufficient for his needa
will be to auction off every key
government post in the kingdom -—
including that of “Sheriff of
Nottingham” I’m afraid you are not
wealthy enough to keep your job

TORNHAM
After all this Richard is leaving
England again

The Queen shrugs --

QUEEN ELEANOR
What did you expect That he would
sit on hig throne and reign over a
kingdom at peace Please My
Richard belongs in France - where
troubadours sing and passion ©
Not here in your land of bailiffs and
“lagal precedent”

Tornham looks away from the Queen stares into the
fireplace

QUEEN ELEANOR
Dent worry For your services to
your King -- and your future
discretion -- you shall have a post
in Richard’s army when he sails
back to France to reconquer the
lands he lost while in prison

Eleanor finally puts away the dagger looks down at the
bandaged Tornham and smiles benevolently

QUEEN ELEANOR (CONTD)
ts the least we can do

DISSOLVE TO
EXT EDGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST DAY
A beautiful sunny morning Tornham stands by his horse his
wounds still bandaged but clean Robin Hood walks up to
him resplendent in NOBLE FINERY

HOOD
Sheriff

TORNHAM
Lord Locksley

Robin Hood can’t help but smile -

HOOD
TL must admit I like the sound of
that
TORNHAM
As does all of Nottingham
BROOD
But nek you eh
TORNEBAM
(simply)

You were not the Arrow Killer
Since King Richard saw fit to
pardon your many other offenses and
restore your lands and titles it
ie net my place to dissent

HOOD
But it could be your place to remain
Sheriff of Nottingham Theres no
doubt youre the best man for the
job And during my

(MORE)

HOOD (contd)
less lawful period I managed to
accumulate enough funds for you to
put a hefty bid in for it
(shrugging)
L would simply be repaying a debt

Sornham considers for a moment - then shakes his head

TORNHAM
Thats very generous of you
But I could not purchase the post
of chief officer of the law with
stolen money

Robin Hood LAUGHS out loud --

HOOD
Gan’t say I didn’t try

Tornbam smiles tightly

TORNHAM
Tell me Robin -- after living so
long ag a wild outlaw in the
forest will you be content inside
the walls of your manorhouse

Robin Hood grins --

HOOD
T£ it’s a manorhouse fit for a
king why not

TORNEAM
Why not indeed

Tornham turns mounts his horee turns back to Robin --

TORNHAM (CONT D
May you spend many happy hours in
the woods all of them hunting --
and none of them breaking the law

Tornham starts his horse off but Robin Hood blocks his paths

HOOD
Bnd what about you Robert of Tornhem
master of Law and order Where shall
you go and what shall you do

TORNHAM
I’m not sure The King has offered me
a post -- but ET dont know if I want

to be part of another invading army

HOOD
Well whether you are hacking
your way through France with King
Richard or teaching law to
spoiled students at Oxford you
will always be the Sheriff of
Nottingham to me

Tornham himself can’t help but smile a little at that one
He reaches out and offers his hand

TORNHAM
Tll take that as a compliment

Robin Hood takes it in his own and the two men shake
HOOD
Now if youll forgive me I have a
wedding to attend

Robin Hood turns and strides away

Tornham watches as Robin Hood REJOINS A VERY LARGE AND VERY
JOYFUL WEDDING PARTY decorated with GARLANDS OF FLOWERS

Robin Hood takes his place as the GROOM
-and of course the BRIDE is Marian
CLOSE ON TORNHAM

Up in his saddle taking one last look his mind filling with
thoughts of what might have been

CLOSE ON MARTAN

Catching Tornhams eye and casting a glance back at him

Their eyes are locked together for what seems like an eternity --

Then Marian finally TURNS AWAY her attention going back to
the Wedding Party and her future husband Robin of Locksley

Robert Tornham the Sheriff of Nottingham turns his horse
around and starts riding away never to return

Bxcept in folktale myth and legend
