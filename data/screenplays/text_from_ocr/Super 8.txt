FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
December 16 2010

OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY A MUFFLED
MASS OF MACHINES GEARS STEAM FADE IN ON

A SIGN Twelve feet across Painted decades earlier grim-
covered black white and red It reads in large 40s era
hand-painted type SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN Then
DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT and below that NUMBERS painted
on hanging metal cards Four possible digits can hang here
but there are currently three 784

SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS rising on a
forklift in a greasy monochromatic work jumpsuit Removes

the 4 from its hooks Then removes the 8 Then the 7

Finally he hangs up a number 1

The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the

hanging single digit wondering about the accident and
how

bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS
IT

BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS

EXT JOES HOUSE - PORCH - DAY

Shiny black loafers Black pants three inches too long We

BOOM UP stopping at a boys hand reaching into the black

suit jacket pocket Pulls out a WOMANS GOLD NECKLACE with a

LOCKET He holds the locket Rubs it gently with his thumb

CONTINUE TO BOOM UP We now SEE THE BOYS FACE

This is JOE LAMB 14 On the precarious edge of adulthood
He

looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes
He moves forward and we PAN so were BEHIND HIM NOW In the
frosty distance past countless leafless trees and modest
homes is a STEEL MILL Smokestacks and structures The
lifeblood of this late 70s town

INT LAMB LIVING ROOM - DAY

Close on CHARLES MOTHER AND FATHER funeral attire She
looks out of the window sadly heartsick and concerned
Behind her he picks at his plate of food

CHARLES MOTHER
Im so worried for that boy

CHARLES FATHER
Joes gonna be okay

CHARLES MOTHER
-she was everything to him

CHARLES FATHER
Jacks gonna step up Hes a good
man

CHARLES MOTHER
But he was never really a
fatherI dont think he
everunderstood Joe

CHARLES FATHER
(maybe a little concerned
HIMSELF)
Joes gonna be okay

But his wife isnt so sure

Then BOYS HUSHED VOICES

INT LAMB DINING ROOM - DAY

CHARLES (well see him in a moment) LEANS FORWARD reaching
for food on a buffet table Charles leaning has revealed
CARY a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie and
PRESTON pale and smart in a DARK SWEATER

CARY
What do you think was in the

MARTIN

and
MARTIN good looking in a shirt and tie at the buffet

CHARLES
I was thinking that about the
coffin

MARTIN

I dont know how you guys can eat

CHARLES
Try a Goddamn turkey roll and
youll discover how Theyre
delicious

CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the

year 1979 At a wake Forty-odd friends and neighbors
darkly

dressed Quiet discussions Some crying

CARY
Either nothing was in there or
like whatever they scraped up--

MARTIN
Jesus -- guys--

CHARLES MARTIN

I heard it crushed her

completely At least keep your voices
DOWN--

PRESTON CHARLES
A steel beam-- those things
weigh a ton Literally If it had been open casket I
would not be eating right
now Despite the turkey
rolls

JACK (0OS)
Hey-- Lucy

They look up -- in the other room a dog (mutt Lucy) has
jumped on a guest for food JACKSON LAMB Joes father 42
black suit moves to the dog walks her out of shot

CHARLES

movie anymore

CARY

CHARLES
Why do you think why The story
Its about the living dead

PRESTON
His mothers not a zombie

CHARLES
But shes dead shithead

CARY
Those turkey rolls are pretty good

CHARLES
Told you

EXT JOES HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

A WIDE SHOT A grey snow-covered early February day here

in
LILLIAN OHIO Many cars are parked outside the house
notably a SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway
Joe a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit
now sits on a small swing set he hasnt used in years
He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds No
doubt

trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around
his mothers neck Then a SOUND Joe looks up A CAR has
arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR
with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center Joe watches as
Someone

for

he

the car sits there for a moment Then a MAN gets out

Joe has seen before but doesnt know personally A man in
his early 40s in jeans and a work shirt Hes not exactly
sloppy but if you look closely you could tell hes been
drinking This is LOUIS DAINARD

Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house to the
porch and inside the house Joes eyes glued on the house

a while Then he looks back to the locket He OPENS IT and
stares at the picture inside (which we do not see) And as

stares TEARS come to his eyes

A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns
toward the house After a beat the SOUND of something
BREAKING -- something glass Then the house BACK DOOR bursts
open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees hell never
forget his father Jack leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED
Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad
car When he slams the back door he sees Joe Sort of
freezes as their eyes lock But Jacks more uncomfortable
THAN COMFORTING

JACK
Ill be home soon

And Jack gets into the car and drives away Joe watches them
drive off And after a beat he looks down at the locket
again Moms just gone Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear
an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK

Over darkness APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE I want you
to want me DRUMS kick in CHEAP TRICK BLASTS CUT TO

EXT MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for
the year winter a memory GIRLS emphatically embrace each
other good-bye BOYS run off just happy to be out Lots of

INT BUILDING 47 - DAY (SUPER 8)

DARKNESS Then a DOOR OPENS Its DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played
by MARTIN) in silhouette He enters Its an old WAREHOUSE
dirty cobwebbed crowded with CRATES old MACHINERY
CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK The Detective turns on his
FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the
light HITTING THE LENS for a moment

The Detective walks through the spooky dark space A low
growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly

Then A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the
Detective aims his flashlight -- tense He watches Waits

see where hes aiming the light which cuts through THICK
DUST in the air Its an old office door ajar

Hathaway is still Nervous Watching the door -- waiting for
it to open and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a
terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the
Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --
and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed
DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaways flesh -- we

that the Zombie is CARY Actually not a bad performance

Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his

-- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip
into Hathaways neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED
NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and
after a significant struggle Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE

so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER
SKULL The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails)
SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE

SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum HISSES of

In the DUST JOE lies frightened on the ground eyes tightly
shut His mind races his heart pounds -- and then A LOUD
METAL BANG Joe stands up fast faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted
STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around
him Just another few feet and he wouldve been crushed But
what was that sound Something metal Then again SLAM Joe
BACKS UP afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN --
MECHANICAL or ANIMAL A crazy SCREECH another BANG then
AGAIN and AGAIN

We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND

THEN CRASH -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE
SHEET OF METAL EXPLODES FROM BEHIND THE OVERTURNED TRAIN

Or is this something else-- And she PUTS HER MOUTH ON HIS
NECK IN A FAKE BITE which makes Joe go still -- a shiver
down his spine -- hes never felt anything like this in his
life And when she pulls back her performance over shes
smiling He doesnt know what to say tries to stay cool

JOE (CONTD)

onto like a paper plate Then you
take a dry brush and you just dip
it in then you brush on the paper
so the paints barely on the brush
Then you make small brush strokes
on the model Little ones like
where the wear and tear would be
Around the wheels Or where the
doors would slide Then you do it
again like with Camouflage Gray--
or here I used Insignia Red to
make it look like there was another
coat of paint on there before Like
they painted over it but you could
see it scratched off

Lost in thought he looks at her Suddenly self-conscious

ALICE

side CLIMBS onto the exposed side -- METAL AND WINDOW
CRUNCHES --

The boys gather their wits -- LIGHTS FLASHING HAUNTINGLY --

JOE
-- you guys okay

CHARLES
-- I wanna go home so bad --

Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door -- tries the
handle -- but its never gonna open

On the OTHER side of the glass Nelec rights himself

momentarily disoriented -- breathing heavily he moves away

from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from
the

kids he tries the handle but it wont open for him either

And there is Joe and Nelec face-to-face -- Joe seeing the

fear in Nelecs eyes -- his understanding that this is his

fate Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joes
face

-- to silently -- in a look -- repent Instantly Joe knows

hes about to watch this mans life end

SMASH Nelec turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door -

SMASHING AT IT -- to make it BIGGER So it can get inside
The Drivers LEG IS CAUGHT -- hes trying to get out but
cannot -- is PANICKING -- as SSSSTAB The creature KILLS
HIM INSTANTLY and SMASH as again it tries to WIDEN the door
Nelec WINCES -- the only conscious man on this side of the
glass the boys COWER on their side with each monstrous
hit
all their eyes on Nelec -- except Joe who only wants to get
to Alice He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW -- above
them on what has become the roof of the bus

JOE
Up there theres broken glass --
the

MARTIN
-- here use me Im strong

JOE
Lemme get on your shoulders

CHARLES
Im strong

The boys struggle to get Joe onto Martins shoulders as on
the other side of the glass Nelec scrambles for Hernandezs
fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE He grabs it and scampers back to the
glass as SMASH Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice

chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening-

On Charles shoulders Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick
window -- which he must HIT -- BREAK OPEN to get out --
essentially exactly what the creature is doing in reverse

Using both fists Joe POUNDS the window No give

MARTIN CARY
Harder Come on you PUSSY

With all his might Joe hits the window again -- the
SLIGHTEST sound of glass adjusting -- meanwhile SLAM The
creature BUSTING the bus door -- PRYING it wider like a

sardine can -- NELEC SITS AGAINST THE GLASS AND OPENS FIRE
FUTILELY ON THE CREATURE He makes a CALL on his walkie

NELEC
This is Nelec -- use the big guns
Whatever happens to me you take it
down you kill him --

-- and he drops the walkie and FIRES AGAIN -- the LOUD
GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe
hits the glass again -- BAM -- a CRINKLING of glass --

CHARLES
You can do it

Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT
OF AMMO That was never really hope anyway Joe hits again
and CRASH The window SHATTERS Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on

boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE
STARTING TO ENTER THE BUS --
to

Joe

You

SHUDDER

CARY
Go Joe move

With all the boys helping Joe pulls himself up -- outside
the bus Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back
Joe -- just fifteen feet away focused on the door -- and

strains to climb out here onto the top-side of the bus

And as the boys climb out the creature climbs in -- first
Joe then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN

gotta lose some weight -- I know) Then Cary and
Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear
SCREAMS and turn back for a moment --

Inside the bus Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE
TIGHT-FITTING BUS SMASHING BENCHES MAKING ITS WAY
TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM And as the creature
descends upon him in the silence before the final lunge --
Nelec says eerily quietly terrified

NELEC
-- it was my turn once to find
you Now its your t--

Before he can finish the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it

would be horrible and brutal if the BLOOD DIDNT SPRAY UPON
THE BULLETPROOF GLASS -- WHICH OUR CAMERA IS SAFELY BEHIND -

OBSCURING THE NIGHTMARISH VIEW

In the field a distance away the boys watch the bus

and SHAKE Then silence They see the creature burst out
of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy away from
them in the overgrown grass like a native hunter Which of
course is partly what it is Theyre sort of stunned

CHARLES

I just sharteezed a little

of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO
SHIT in collateral damage

An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run
BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing
through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and
some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG
HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside -

INT NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE - NIGHT

OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness
they didnt -- because -- and now were looking STRAIGHT
FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has

DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN dirt PILED
caked along the sides of the structure The boys catch their

breath

CARY
Whoa This is scary
SPARKLER

far

JOE
You got any sparklers in there

CARY
Are you kidding me

Cary opens his backpack whips out a Fourth of July
LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN The thing falls

enough to tell them its too far to jump

But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole it
lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom

JOE
-- Alice is down there

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

A JEEP roars past

INT JEEP - NIGHT

Jack drives fast Louis sits beside him Its awkward But
not angry Finally vulnerable scared and sad

LOUIS
I came to your house that day To
tell you that I never meant to hurt
anyone Swear to God
(beat respectful tears)
Im sorry Jack About what
happened to your wife

Jack looks at him for a moment then back to the road A
beat Finally

JACK
It was an accident It was an
accident
Jack glances at him A small nod of forgiveness and

gratitude Louis wants to cry again but just accepts it

INT SHED - NIGHT
Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE

INT CEMETERY SHED HOLE - NIGHT

Joe lands on the bottom Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary
climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above
him Now Cry lands too There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO
Joes mind races about which way to go

CARY
Joe I dont understand--

We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off but
MECHANICAL Then

JOE

Shhh This way

They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel a TALL OVAL
TUNNEL TWENTY FEET TALL --

INT TUNNEL 1 (WFURNIURE) - NIGHT

Were SO FAR AWAY that the screen is mostly black with a
small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT

They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING
ROOM They look up ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN DUG STRAIGHT
THROUGH A HOUSE They continue coming to an INTERSECTION --
where a NEW TUNNEL branches off

INT TUNNEL 2 - NIGHT

Theres DIM LIGHT from up ahead where the tunnel BENDS The
RUMBLINGMECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now Joe and Cary slowly
move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and
amazes them all at once

ITS A HUNDRED-FOOT DIAMETER FORTY-FOOT TALL UNDERGROUND
SPACE FILLED WITH A MECHANICAL MARVEL -- A MASSIVE BIZARRE
CONTRAPTION COMBINING THOUSANDS OF MECHANICAL PIECES FROM
THE MISSING MICROWAVES CAR ENGINES ANTENNAS AND COUNTLESS
OTHER DEVICES -- WIRES AND CABLES HANG AND CONNECT
EVERYWHERE ALL LEADING TO THE DIRT CEILING HEADING UP TO
SOMEWHERE ABOVE GROUND THE THICK-WITH-FUMES SPACE CHUGS AND
HUMS WITH A SLOWLY INCREASING PITCH AS IT ITS WARMING UP
GETTING READY TO FINALLY ACTUALLY WORK

They cross to the other side Cary bumps into a HANGING
SHERIFF PRUITT Cary is about to scream but Joe puts a hand
on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt

CARY
Its Sheriff Pruitt

JOE
I know Cary look

Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light a number of
other

TUNNELS are visible from here too Joe and Cary look at the

space in disbelief

CARY
What is this
JOE
Were under the water tower

Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Carys shirt
Cary looks THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND
DANGLING CABLES AT THE OTHER END OF THIS UNDERGROUND
EXPERIMENT IS THE CREATURE HUNCHED OVER BACK TO THE BOYS
AND ITS SAVAGELY EATING SOMETHING IT MOVES A BIT WE SEE
ITS A HUMAN LEG Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didnt
need to stay quiet In a panicked WHISPER

CARY
Its eating a person

Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other
side of the machinery -- and there he sees in an INSET
section of the rock-wall THREE HUMAN BODIES HANGING
LIFELESS FROM THEIR FEET WRAPPED IN SOME KIND OF THIN
SHELLAC TIGHT ON JOE as he sees among them ALICE His
heart POUNDS his resolve quadruples Cary sees her too --

JOE
Shes here Were going to use your
firecrackers

CARY
I dont think its going to hurt
it Joe

JOE
There are other tunnels

CARY
So

JOE
I need you to make noise Lots of

LIGHTER from Cary)
Make sure youre gone by the time
it blows you cant be here you
gotta run

CARY
Where are you going

But Joes already gone Stay with Cary who opens his

backpack starts pulling out his amazing array of
EXPLOSIVES

glancing up to make sure hes out of the creatures view --

INT TUNNEL 3 - NIGHT

MOVE FAST with Joe as he races a LIT SPARKLER giving him

his
light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now Joe runs
looking for another way into the creatures massive space --
he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it --
he disappears down the tunnel --
INT TUNNEL 2 - NIGHT
Carys made a long insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses
an

OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY LONG LINE OF GUN
POWDER back away from the firecrackers -- away from the
entrance to the creatures CONTRAPTION space
with

INT TUNNEL 4 - NIGHT

Joe races down the dirt tunnel the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL
RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER The
SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE who slows --
peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER
SIDE of the space He sees the creature -- then looks across
to the lifeless body of Alice His heart sinks

INT TUNNEL 2 - NIGHT

Carys done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his
lighter -- FFFT FFFT The damn thing wont light --

He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICES
LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves

her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE
LIGHTER STARTING TO CRY AND HE FLICKS IT AND FFFFFTH IT
LIGHTS HE TOUCHES IT ON THE GUN POWDER AND RUNS OFF --

meal of Alice looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS then

LEAVES

INTO THE DARKNESS HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them --

They run and run and run but then BOOM they hit a DEAD
A DIRT WALL No more tunnels No options Out of breath
turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying

The only SOUND the sparkler their erratic breathing and the
DISTANT INCREASING PITCH OF THE CREATURES MECHANICAL

THE CREATURE IS THERE -- FORTY FEET FROM THEM --
APPROACHING ALICE SCREAMS -- SHE AND CARY MORE BACK AGAINST

AND IT GRABS JOE AND LIFTS HIM -- Alice and Cary SCREAM AS
JOE IS BEING SQUEEZED -- HE LOOKS INTO THE GLOSSY BLACK EYES
OF THIS BEAST WHICH COULD KILL HIM AT ANY TIME -- but in
this moment of fear comes something else Simple truth -- he
WHISPERS SHAKILY

JUST AS WE THINK THE CREATURES GONNA KILL HIM A DISTANT
MECHANICAL TONE -- THE CREATURE TURNS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
SOUND -- THEN TO JOE AGAIN IT CONSIDERS HIM ITS EYES
COVERING PEELS AWAY -- REVEALING HUGE WET VULNERABLE EYES
AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM REALLY LOOKS AT HIM In a way

you imagine his mother once had And Joe feels this too AND
AFTER A LONG SCARY BEAT THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN Joe
backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY JOE IS
STUNNED SHOCKED RELIEF ALICE AND CARY TOO --

CARY
Okay wait a minute WHAT

Then over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS

- like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP --

EXT LILLIAN OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET COUNTLESS
OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY
DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at

speeds and with different personalities metal objects
TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER AND STICK THERE

Suddenly THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH
IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER
TOWER HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS move past them -- from bicycles

silverware and sinks DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE
TOWNS APPLIANCE STORE WINDOW -- A TV FLOATS UNPLUGGED

THE KIDS -- AND IT IS ON -- AND SHOWS AN EPISODE FROM THE
TWILIGHT ZONE -- all things eventually SLAMMING into the
WATER TOWER the objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER

ONE DENSE METALLIC MASS

BAM BAMBAM Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- the KIDS TURN behind
them are the RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE those cubes
BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS BAM BAMBAMBAM BAMBAM And
they SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN
ODD HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER Alice is cry-
laughing at seeing it work --

JOE
hes making a model

AGAIN and AGAIN pieces FLY OVERHEAD beginning to FORM WHAT
IS CLEARLY AN ALIEN CRAFT -- LIGHTS BEGINNING TO ILLUMINATE

FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS
ILLUMINATING A JEEP THAT HAS JUST ARRIVED JACK GETS OUT HE

SEES JOE JOE IS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM -- ALICE CONCERNED

BUT THEN THE KIDS ARE BOTH INCREDULOUS TO SEE JACK HELP
OUT OF THE JEEP -- THE TWO MEN MOVE THROUGH THE DEBRIS IN

STREETS STUNNED AT THE ACTIVITY SURROUNDING THEM BUT
FOCUSED ON THEIR CHILDREN A TUMBLING TYPEWRITER ALMOST

OUT JACK BUT HE AVOIDS IT AS IT SHOOTS UP TO THE WATER
TOWER

JACK GETS TO HIS SON -- HOLDS HIS SHOULDERS -- LOOKS DEEPLY
INTO HIS EYES TOUCHES HIS FACE AND EMBRACES HIM --

JACK
-- I got you I got you

LOUIS CRYING DESPERATELY SORRY -- AND SHE SEES THIS IN HIS
SAD WOUNDED FACE -- SHE HOLDS OUT A HAND -- HE TAKES IT AND
PULLS HER INTO AN EMBRACE HUGGING HIS DAUGHTER DESPERATELY

BEHIND THEM THE SHIP CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE ALMOST FULLY-
FORMED -- but here as he is being hugged by his father Joe
LOOKS DOWN SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he

it confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it
out HIS MOTHERS NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain but

LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go

Joe knows what this means He looks up at his father who
also understand AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --
FROM HERE UNTIL THE END After a long beat Joe HOLDS THE
NECKLACE UP toward the tower -- the thing PULLING TEARS
in Joes eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go
but knowing he must Jack heartsick watches his son on

verge of letting go Alice watches Joe on the verge of
not

on

UP

-- except Joe just cant bring himself to do it not now
ever But then something happens

Pulled by the invisible force THE LOCKET POPS OPEN And we
see whats inside A PHOTOGRAPH of Joes MOTHER A young
woman HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY And Joe looks at his
mother -- and in this moment she at him and Jacks eyes
suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice too tears streaming down
her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand

his sons shoulder -- which was all Joe needed really

And finally after all JOE LETS GO OUR SCORE SOARS AS
IN SLOW MOTION the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET

TO THE WATER TOWER

AND WHEN IT HITS THE ENTIRE TOWER IMPLODES FROM PRESSURE --
A FIREWORKS-LIKE EXPLOSION OF WATER BURSTS AND SHOWERS THE
STREET AS THE MAJESTIC SHIP COMPLETES ITS FORMATION -- and
thats when Joe sees the CREATURE LEAVING -- CLIMBING UP
WATER TOWER AND ENTERS HIS SHIP -- AND IT BEGINS TO LIFT AS
IT TAKES OFF THE WEIGHT OF THE TOWER IS TOO MUCH IT

COLLAPSES INTO MAIN STREET

THE SHIP RISES SLOWLY INTO THE SKY -- ITS PURE WHITE
SPOTLIGHTS FINALLY SCANNING THE GROUND BENEATH IT --

OHIO -- EARTH -- A PLANET IT IS FINALLY LEAVING --

INTEXT HOUSE - NIGHT

And we PUSH IN on Charles and Marin who watch amazed as
the distant light RISES INTO THE SKY --

EXT DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

And we PUSH IN as DONNY SLEEPS the REFLECTION OF THE RISING
SHIP seen in his windshield --

EXT LILLIAN OHIO - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Joe and Alice Jack Louis and Cary watch amazed as the

ship disappears into the night sky we are TIGHT ON JOES
HAND as it takes ALICES
And looking skyward Joe smiles
As our SCORE SWELLS we finally

FADE TO BLACK
