FADE IN

INT VIDEO BOOTH - TIME CAPSULE FOOTAGE MARNI OLSEN sits in a dark VIDEO BOOTH against a
black backdrop She has frizzy hair shiny braces and
thick Coke bottle glasses Someday she’ll be attractive
but for now she is the definition of awkward

She speaks to an UNSEEN INTERVIEWER A TIME STAMP at the
bottom of the frame reads “RIDGEFIELD HIGH SCHOOL -
VIDEO TIME CAPSULE - 4272001

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI
My name Right It’s um Marni Olsen
I’m a junior at Ridgefield High Hi

She WAVES Then to the Interviewer

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (CONT’D)
So this is going to be buried for
like fifty years right And you just
want me to tell you what life is like
for high school students in 2001
(then)
Life is hard

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

CLOSE ON Marni stiff as a board She appears to “surf”
atop a crowded hallway Students stare as she floats by

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
You ever have one of those days when
you feel cursed Like nothing is going
your way That’s what high school has
been like for me

WIDEN TO REVEAL she’s being carried by a group of
attractive BITCHY GIRLS Obviously the popular crowd

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO) (CONTD)
Every day

INT CAFETERIA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Marni walks through the cafeteria carrying her lunch
tray She passes the “A” TABLE staring with envy

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
I come from a small town And ina
school as small as mine there’s always
one person who stands out from the
rest One person so famous they out-
shine all others

Marni locks eyes with a BITCHY GIRL who gives her an
EVIL LOOK making it clear she’s in the wrong section
Marni is terrified but somehow can’t look away and

WHAM She plows right into a CUTE FOOTBALL JOCK Food
everywhere Students LAUGH and POINT Marni is horrified

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO) (CONTD)
In my class I was that person

EXT HIGH SCHOOL QUAD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

DANCE TEAM TRYOUTS Marni and the Bitchy Girls strut
their stuff hoping to get tapped for the squad All the
girls dance in perfect sync except Marni She’s awful

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
I read somewhere that who you are in
high school determines who you’1l be
for the rest of your life

Marni distracted by the same CUTE FOOTBALL JOCK makes a
wrong turn and CRASHES into the GIRL NEXT TO HER WHAP
She takes a HIGH KICK in the face

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO) (CONTD)
I seriously hope that’s not the case

INT HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Marni walks down the hall She catches her REFLECTION on
the glass of a TROPHY CASE She now has a BLACK EYE

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
Because the thought of this stretching
out over my entire life really scares
me
(then)
At first I thought it was genetic

We notice a BANNER inside the trophy case reads
“RIDGEFIELD ROYALTY” We PAN ACROSS A PHOTO GALLERY of
PAST HOMECOMING QUEENS until we stop on a PHOTO of a
beautiful 18-YEAR-OLD GIRL in a tiara This is TEEN
GAIL Marni’s mom 30 years ago She is flanked by her
homecoming court

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO) (CONTD)
But just look at my Mom

INT KITCHEN - DAY GAIL now a MOM dressed in a TROOP LEADER UNIFORM multi-
tasks with a phone under her chin a BABY in her arms

and dinner on the stove KIDS and DOGS run wildly through
the scene but Gail doesn’t flinch This is one stay-at-
home mom who has it all under control

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
There’s nothing she can’t do When I
grow up I want to be just like her
BACK TO MARNI IN THE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)

Marni continues down the hall past another TROPHY CASE
this one devoted to ATHLETIC GREATNESS

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
And my brother Wade is like amazing

INSIDE THE CASE We ZOOM IN on a picture of a VARSITY
FOOTBALL PLAYER (WADE 18) catching a pass mid-air HOLD
ON THE IMAGE OF WADE as it COMES TO LIFE and we are

EXT FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

-right in the middle of the STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
Wade effortlessly CATCHES the ball and tucks it under his
arm heading down the sideline for the END ZONE

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
He’s the greatest At everything

The crowd GOES WILD CHEERLEADERS CHEER The school
MASCOT wearing a giant GATOR SUIT jumps up and down so
wildly that it accidentally bumps into the Cheerleaders

BITCHY GIRL
Outta my way

The Cheerleader SHOVES the Mascot who stumbles onto the
field and into the path of an oncoming DEFENDER BAM
The GATOR HEAD flies into the air revealing MARNI inside
the costume

Flat on her back she can barely see Wade running the
ball in for the winning TOUCHDOWN The crowd CHEERS
Marni stares up from the ground and notices her image
displayed on the JUMBOTRON She wants to die Her
attention is turned to the Bitchy Girls who sing Queen’s
“We Are The Champions” as they walk off the field

BITCHY GIRLS
“We are the champions my friend And
well keep on fighting ‘till the
end

Marni locks eyes with one of the Bitchy Girls whose eyes
NARROW It’s clear they are singing this song to Marni

BITCHY GIRLS (CONTD)
“No time for losers ‘cause we are the
champions Of the world”

Suddenly a hand reaches into frame to help a teary-eyed
Marni up It’s Wade

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
Wade always picks me up when I get
down He was the one who told me
INT TREEHOUSE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Wade and Marni sit in an old-fashioned TREEHOUSE

WADE
Someday you’1ll put all this behind you
and you’ll start to see all the great
things about yourself that I see

Marni considers

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
I hope Wade’s right But if I’m gonna
see anything great about myself I’m
gonna have to look at myself through
new eyes

INT EYE DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY (FLASH-FORWARD)

We find Marni being fitted for CONTACT LENSES Bye bye
Coke bottle glasses

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
And once I’ve changed the way I see
myself

INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY (FLASH-FORWARD )

Marni in her GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN collects her
DIPLOMA Her family CLAPS furiously in the audience

16 YEAR-OLD MARNI (VO)
I think this small town girl will be
ready for a change of scenery

Instead of returning to her seat she walks up the aisle
towards the EXIT Gail and the rest of Marni’s family
exchange confused looks Wade on the aisle WINKS at
Marni and hands her an ENVELOPE Inside is A PLANE TICKET
TO NYC Marni BEAMS

CUT TO

PRESENT DAY MARNI

Staring right at us Only this Marni (now 24) is more
confident more poised Braces and frizzy hair long gone
She holds up a picture of her 16 year-old self in all
her frizzy-haired brace-faced and bad-skinned glory

MARNI

I’ve kept this picture to remind
myself of how far I’ve come since
those horrible days Because if it
weren’t for the determination of the
girl in this photo

(holding out photo)
-the woman in front of you would not
be standing here today
WIDEN TO REVEAL she speaks to a group of NEW RECRUITS

MARNI (CONTD)
Working for one of the top PR Firms in
New York Telling a group of aspiring
publicists about the days when I was
the poster child for the geek squad

Everyone LAUGHS

MARNI (CONTD)
My Mom always taught me that everyone
deserves a second chance And I’m
living proof that she was right I
think that’s why I got into PR in the
first place because second chances
are what we give our clients every
day So if you guys take one thing
from my experiences it’s that the
negative situations we encounter are
only temporary We can’t control the
things that happen to us but we can
control the way we react to them And
that is what Public Relations is all
about

The room fills with applause as Marni smiles

INT ATRPLANE — DAY

Marni sits in her seat talking on her cell phone as
passengers settle in around her

MARNTI
--just leave those contracts on my
desk I’1l sign them Monday And
remember no calls For the next four
days I am on vacation My brother is
getting married and I don’t want any
drama this weekend

Marni’s PHONE BEEPS She looks at the CALLER ID “MOM”

MARNI (CONTD)

I’ve gotta jump I’1l see you Monday

(clicking over)

Hi Mom I’m on the plane This is so
exciting Is Wade freaking out

GAIL (0S)
Are you kidding He’s happier than
ever Leave it to your brother to pull
off a whirlwind romance

MARNTI
I still can’t believe I haven’t met
Joanna yet Wade said she was in the
class above me but I don’t remember a
Joanna Goldman And it wasn’t like it
was a huge school or anything
GAIL (0S)
Oh that’s probably because in high
school she didn’t go by Joanna She
went by JJ

JJ This gets Marni’s attention

MARNT
JJ

A Flight Attendant taps Marni on the shoulder and
gestures for her to TURN OFF her phone

GAIL (0S)
It’s a nickname But she doesn’t use
it much anymore

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Maam Please The phone

Marni gives her the “just a minute” finger
MARNI
Well I didn’t know a JJ Goldman
either so
GAIL (0S)
Actually Goldman was her mother’s
maiden name She took it after her Mom
died At Ridgefield she went by a
different name Let me think
Uh-oh Marni sinks into her seat

GAIL (0S) (CONTD)
Oh what was it

Marni begins to sweat Then offers weakly

MARNI
Freeman

GAIL (0S)
Yes That’s it

Marni dies a little The blood drains from her face
SMASH CUT TO

A RAPID-FIRE MONTAGE

As familiar painful IMAGES flash through Marnis brain SCHOOL HALLWAY Marni is carried above the heads of
the Bitchy Girls We ZOOM in on the girl at the front
obviously the ring leader It’s JJ FREEMAN CAFETERIA Marni with her lunch tray She locks eyes
with a Bitchy Girl Yep JJ FREEMAN She crashes into the
cute football jock Food everywhere STATE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME Marni CHEERS in her GATOR
suit She crashes into JJ FREEMAN JJ shoves her onto
the field where she gets nailed by the DEFENDER

BACK TO PRESENT

Marni LOSES IT

MARNT

Everyone in the cabin turns to look at her Marni gets
up and pushes by the Flight Attendant

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Ma’am Please return to your seat
We’re about to take off

MARNI
Not with me you’re not

Marni accosts the PASSENGER in the EMERGENCY AISLE

MARNI (CONTD)
(re emergency door)
Hi Could you open that door for me
Give it a crank

PASSENGER
I can’t do that

MARNI
Then you shouldn’t be sitting there
It’s like the first thing they ask

The Flight Attendant pulls Marni aside

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Miss these doors are to be used for
emergencies only

MARNI
I’m sorry did you miss the scream
This is an emergency My brother is
marrying JJ Freeman The girl who
single-handedly ruined my young adult
life So if you don’t mind back off

As Marni pushes past the Flight Attendant she is stopped
by a BURLY SKY MARSHAL

SKY MARSHAL
Do we have a problem here

INT AIRPLANE GALLEY - LATER

Marni sits in the JUMP SEAT next to the SKY MARSHAL Her
hands are bound by ZIP-TIE HANDCUFFS She struggles to
sip from a JUICE BOX
MARNI
So years later that video of the
Ridgefield Mascot getting plowed is
still in the YouTube top 100 I
stopped counting after a million hits

Marni sucks down her juice box The now-consoling Sky
Marshal hands her another puts the straw in for her

SKY MARSHAL
Nobody told you he was marrying the
same girl

MARNT
Wade was a senior when I was a
freshman He probably didn’t know who
JJ was I can’t blame him for not
keeping track of his little sister’s
high school soap opera

SKY MARSHAL
What about your parents

MARNT
They know I had a hard time but they
have no idea what I actually went
through
(then)
I can’t believe this is happening I
mean she’s the reason I left
Ridgefield in the first place

She nervously bites her nails

SKY MARSHAL
Marni a bully is like a terrorist An
emotional terrorist You can’t let
them get the upper hand The most
important thing you can do in this
situation is to stay calm and show JJ
that you are in control now

MARNI
(processing)
Right I’m in control

SKY MARSHAL
But I don’t know what you’re so
worried about High school was a long
time ago This could all turn out to

be nothing
A beat Marni considers It was a long time ago

MARNI
Maybe you’re right Maybe I am
overreacting Things have changed
since high school I’ve changed And
I mean JJs gotta feel bad about the
way she treated me right
The Sky Marshal nods confidently

MARNI (CONT’D)
Maybe it’s time I closed the door on
high school once and for all

SMASH CUT TO
A CAR TRUNK SLAMMING SHUT

WIDEN TO REVEAL Marni and her mom GAIL in the AIRPORT
PARKING LOT loading Marni’s BAGS into a hybrid SUV GAIL
is 50 and fine with it A beauty in the most natural way
she celebrates her laugh lines and the memories that
created them Marni’s brother BEN sits in the back
seat drinking a COKE Marni notices Gail’s JEANS

MARNI
Are those AG jeans Mom when did you
become so hip

Gail self-consciously pulls up the waistband of her new
low-rise jeans They get into the car

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

GAIL
Do they look ridiculous They’re too
low right

MARNT
They’re not too low They look great
BEN
I saw your butt crack when you sat
down
GAIL

That’s it I’m taking them back I
told Joanna I’m 50 years old I have
no business wearing low-cut jeans
anymore but she made me buy them

MARNTI
You went shopping with Joanna

BEN
(rolling his eyes)
We do everything with Joanna
Marni ponders this not sure how she feels

GAIL
Honey is everything okay

MARNT
Yeah why

GAIL
Well when we were on the phone
earlier you seemed a little upset
when we started talking about Joanna

MARNT
(laughs it off)
Me Upset Don’t be ridiculous

GAIL
Marni the way you screamed I thought
your plane had been hijacked
(then)
I promise once you get to know her
youre going to love Joanna

MARNI
Well Mom that’s the thing Joanna and
I did know each other in high school
And the truth is it wasn’t pretty

Gail’s face falls pondering the implications of this

MARNI (CONTD)

Don’t freak out I wasn’t even going
to bring it up But I did a lot of
thinking on the plane and I’m not the
same girl I was back at Ridgefield and
I can’t imagine Joanna is either So
as far as I am concerned this weekend
is about Wade and Joanna’s future not

my past

Marni smiles confidently

GAIL

I am so glad to hear you say that
because with everything we have to
deal with in the next 72 hours we
really don’t have time for any drama

(to Ben)
That means you too Mister I want you
on your best behavior starting
tonight Joanna’s aunt is coming for
dinner and we only get one chance to
make a good impression You get me

Ben finishes his Coke and replies in a deep BURP voice

BEN
YES

Marni can’t help but laugh Gail frowns and gives Marni a
“don’t encourage him” look The car phone RINGS Gail
answers It’s Gail’s husband STAN He sounds panicked

STAN (0S)
Gail we have a problem

GAIL
Stan maybe you’d like to say hello to
your daughter

STAN

Hi honey

(back to business)
Gail the wedding planner called That
tropical storm in the gulf grounded
all the flights The lobsters we
ordered for the rehearsal dinner
aren’t coming What do we do

Gail doesn’t flinch In a calm soothing tone

GAIL
Stan this is not a problem Global
warming Poverty Those are problems
Tell Monique not to panic I’1l call
her later We’ll deal with it

They AD-LIB good-byes Stan hangs up
GAIL (CONTD)
Who needs lobster I have all my kids
home and we’re having a wedding
Nothing is going to ruin this weekend
Gail smiles at Marni They are both optimistic

INT MARNIS BEDROOM - DAY

Marni lugs her suitcase into her bedroom which features
lots of pink and TWIN BEDS She’s confused to find FOUR
HUGE SUITCASES piled onto one of the beds Gail ENTERS

GAIL
Sorry honey Full house this weekend
You and Joanna are sharing a room

Marni puts her game face on

MARNT
Fun It’ll be like the slumber party
we never had

Gail EXITS Marni surveys her old room She pulls a
YEARBOOK from a shelf We see pictures of JJ Freeman and
her numerous accomplishments Homecoming Queen Prom
Queen etc

WADE (0S)
Look who finally made it

Marni turns to find WADE standing right behind her

MARNI
Wade

They embrace then transition into an elaborate HANDSHAKE
that has obviously been mastered over many years

MARNI (CONT’D)
It’s so good to see you

WADE
Tell me about it You believe I’m
doing this I didn’t think I’d ever
get married I guess people can
change huh

MARNI
I’m counting on it

WADE
Youre going to love Joanna Marni
She’s been so anxious to see you
Cmon she’s in the kitchen
He grabs her pulls her towards the door She pulls away

MARNI
Give me two seconds

INT BATHROOM - A MINUTE LATER

Marni stands in front of the mirror staring intently
MARNI
High school was a long time ago
Youve got nothing to be afraid of
SMASH CUT TO

A RAZOR-SHARP KITCHEN KNIFE
As it comes down onto a CUTTING BOARD hard and fast
WHACK It cleaves an unsuspecting tomato in half with one
stroke WIDEN TO REVEAL that we are

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Gail stands at the kitchen island watching JOANNA GOLDMAN aka JJ Freeman dicing a tomato with the knife
She’s a vision of perfection A refined woman oozing with
self confidence

JOANNA
Then you simply finish it like this

She’s carved the tomato into a DECORATIVE FLOWER DESIGN

GAIL
How beautiful Joanna

JOANNA
It’s nothing compared to this
beautiful spread I can’t believe you
made all this food You’re amazing

REVEAL ten impressive platters of food on the counter

GAIL
Well I didn’t know what kind of food
your aunt liked so I just made a
little of everything It was nothing

Just then Wade enters with Marni in tow

WADE
Look who I found

Joanna and Marni make eye contact After a long beat
JOANNA
(emotional)
Marni
(then)
Marni Marni Marni

Are those tears in Joannas eyes
JOANNA (CONTD)
Oh Marni I’ve waited so long for
this moment and finally it’s here

MARNI
You waited so long

JOANNA
There’s just so much to say

MARNI
I know Believe me I know

JOANNA
But first let me say

Could this be it The big apology

JOANNA (CONTD)
-how

Wait for it Wait for it

JOANNA (CONTD)
nice it is to finally meet you

Marni’s JAW DROPS Say what

MARNI
Excuse me

JOANNA
Wades told me so much about you but
now here you are In the flesh

MARNI
But--

JOANNA
I can’t wait to spend the next four
days learning all about my new sister
Joanna EMBRACES Marni who is too stunned to hug back

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone files into the dining room and finds a seat at
the table Marni who’s already seated watches Joanna
like a hawk still in disbelief Ben moves to sit next to
Wade but

WADE
Hey man you mind scooting down one so
Joanna can sit here

Disappointed Ben moves to the next seat as Joanna sits
beside Wade Gail brings out the final tray of food

GAIL
Joanna are you sure we shouldn’t wait
for your aunt

JOANNA
Don’t worry about Aunt Mona Her plane
was delayed no telling when she’1l
get in She can fend for herself

Gail proceeds to BLINDFOLD Stan acting as if this is a
common occurrence

MARNI
Um what’s up with the blindfold

GAIL
Ever since Wade made your father Best
Man he’s been under a lot of pressure
Self imposed pressure

STAN
Hey I don’t want to get up there and
look fat in front of all those people
So I started this new diet Most
people don’t realize when they’re
full they need an empty plate to tell
them But when you wear a blindfold
you rely on your stomach So you eat
less I’ve already lost eight pounds
for the wedding

BEN
(to Marni)
It’s so embarrassing when we go out

JOANNA
Well I think it’s a very smart way to
stay fit

Ben cuts his eyes at Joanna kiss-ass

STAN
Who said that

BEN
Who do you think

The family digs into the meal Stan stabs away at his
food with a fork missing his plate entirely He actually
spears the potato on Ben’s plate Gail steers Stan’s hand
back to his own plate

MARNI
So how’d you two meet

JOANNA
We were at this cute little karaoke
bar at the beach Wade was on stage
doing his best Captain and Tennille

WADE
Definitely not my finest hour

JOANNA
Yeah it was a little embarrassing
But he was so cute I just had to save
him so I jumped on stage and we sang
it together

WADE
And she’s been saving me ever since

Joanna lets out a big “Awwwww” and they melt into a kiss
Ben ROLLS HIS EYES

GAIL
I still can’t believe that in a little
town like Ridgefield you two could
grow up five minutes away from each
other but not cross paths until now
Isn’t life funny

MARNI
Hilarious Joanna I still can’t
believe our paths havent crossed
until now I mean talk about funny

JOANNA
(laughing)
I know right

The girls hold a stare just long enough to make it
slightly uncomfortable But then cheerful as ever

JOANNA (CONT’D)
Marni I can’t wait to hear what
youve been doing the last few years

Marni grins Time to shine
MARNI
Oh Well after I graduated from NYU
I started working at RMK the biggest
PR Firm in New York We represent A-
list celebrities rock bands
athletes designers you name it

JOANNA
Wow I can’t believe you get to
interact with real celebrities
That’s so exciting

Marni couldn’t feel more pleased with herself

MARNI
Yes well You know how it is

JOANNA
Well not me But my Aunt Mona does
She lives in New York too She knows
tons of fancy people

Marni’s cell phone RINGS She answers

BEN
No fair How come Marni gets to use
her cell phone at the table

GAIL
We do have a new rule honey

Marni covers the phone with her hand

MARNT
Really ‘Cause I’ve got 150 lobsters
sitting on the tarmac at JFK But if
you don’t want ‘em I can totally hang

up--
GAIL
What NO Don’t hang up

As Marni finishes up her call everyone exchanges
impressed looks Marni hangs up

MARNT
Done They’1ll be delivered to the club
first thing tomorrow

GAIL
How did you do that

MARNI
A client owed me It was nothing

JOANNA
Nothing You’re amazing

MARNT
Enough about me I want to hear what
Joannas been up to since graduation

JOANNA
My life is pretty dull by comparison

MARNI
I’m sure your life is very exciting I
want to hear all about it

JOANNA

Okay But I promise you it’s not
nearly as glamorous as yours

(then)
After my mom died I took a hard look
at my life and what I was doing with
it I wasn’t happy with my choices So
I enrolled in nursing school and
focused all my energy into helping
those who are less fortunate

Marni can’t believe what she’s hearing

JOANNA (CONT’D)
I realized that there was an entire
world of people in need So I started
the Ridgefield County Meals On Wheels
program right after graduation That
turned out to be such a rewarding
experience I felt I had to do more
And since I’ve always loved children
I came up with this idea to help
cultivate the self-esteem of
underprivileged kids through music
education

DISSOLVE TO

INT DINING ROOM - 20 MINUTES LATER

Marni completely dumbstruck listens to Joanna’s
seemingly never-ending recap of the last four years

JOANNA
after only three months of working
as an entry-level RN they promoted me
to Head Clinical Nurse But since my
volunteer work was keeping me super
busy I had to adjust my priorities
‘Cause let’s be honest you can only
run a suicide hotline for so long
before it starts to take its toll

BEN
(bored to tears)
Do you still have that number

Marni stifles a laugh Gail shakes her head
disapprovingly at Ben

JOANNA
Oh gosh I’ve been talking about
myself way too much haven’t I

MARNT
No no I had no idea you were such
a giver

WADE

I’m so proud of her
Wade leans in to KISS Joanna Marni can’t take it

MARNI
Excuse me I’m going to get a refill

She exits to the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Marni grabs a drink out of the fridge She watches Joanna
through the doorway laughing along with her family
Joannas really at home here Marni slams the fridge
door REVEALING GAIL standing right there

MARNTI
Jeez You scared me

GAIL
So What do you think Joanna’s great
right

MARNT

Yeah Almost too good to be true

GAIL
So what’s wrong

MARNI

I just think it’s kind of weird Joanna
doesn’t remember me I mean
Ridgefield wasn’t that big

GAIL
It’s not so weird I don’t remember
half the people I went to school with

MARNTI
That was like a million years ago I
knew you wouldn’t understand

GAIL
First of all it was half a million
years ago and B) What don’t I
understand

MARNT
Everyone loved you Mom You were the
Prom Queen

(MORE )

MARNI (CONTD)
The captain of the cheerleading squad
You have no idea what I went through
in high school

Gail eyes her

GAIL
Wanna bet Honey trust me no one
gets through high school unscathed

MARNT
You never told me you had problems in
high school

GAIL
It was a long time ago I got over it
What’s past is past Marni
(then)
If things didn’t end well with Joanna
here’s your chance to make it right
Remember everyone deserves

MARNI
»-a second chance I know

SFX DING-DONG They hear the doorbell Gail LIGHTS UP

GAIL
That must be Aunt Mona

INT FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Marni follows Gail into the foyer where Stan and Wade
have already answered the door to greet their guest

Joanna stands in the doorway wrapped in a hug with AUNT
MONA whose BACK IS TO US But even from this angle we
can tell she is impeccably groomed a true Fashionista
her accessories alone cost more than Gail’s car

AUNT MONA
Look at you I just can’t believe my
little JJ is getting married

Joanna sees Gail and Marni approaching

JOANNA
Aunt Mona I want you to meet Wade’s
sister Marni

Mona TURNS SLOWLY We get the full picture smooth skin
perfect make-up Flawless from her head to her Manolos
Is she 30 50 Don’t bother asking She’1ll never tell

JOANNA (CONTD)
and his mom--

AUNT MONA
Gail

Clearly Aunt Mona knows Gail And as we PUSH IN CLOSE ON
GAIL’S FACE it’s clear that she knows Aunt Mona too

GAIL
(OH MY GOD)
Ramona
JOANNA

Wait You two know each other

Gail’s mind starts reeling as painful memories come
flooding back

FLASHBACK - PROM NIGHT MUSIC CUE Heart’s “Barracuda” Teens mingle by a pool
We find TEEN GAIL wearing a halter neck maxi-dress
her hair feathered with Farrah-like precision gazing
into the eyes of her HANDSOME DATE

suddenly a much less attractive RAMONA flies
into frame She PUSHES Gail into the DEEP END OF THE
POOL As Gail breaks the surface we see a look of TOTAL
HORROR on her face

BACK TO PRESENT DAY

Gail steadies herself against the wall

GAIL
I don’t believe it

Ramona embraces Gail AIR-KISSING each cheek

RAMONA
How long has it been
(playful)
Actually don’t tell or I’1l kill you

GAIL
(nervous )
Who can remember

FLASHBACK - PROM NIGHT Were in Gail’s “CARRIE”-like memory of her teen-self in
the pool soaked to the bone dress completely ruined
Classmates stare at their beloved Prom Queen their JAWS
DROPPED

BACK TO PRESENT DAY

Ramona turns to Marni
RAMONA
You must be Marni You are definitely
your mother’s daughter

Again with the AIR-KISSES

RAMONA (CONT’D)
(turns to Ben)
And aren’t you handsome Just like
your father

Ramona cups Ben’s face in her hands Ben squirms

RAMONA (CONTD)
You have a beautiful family Gail

Gail studies Ramona Is she for real

MARNT
How do you guys know each other

GAIL
We went to high school together You
look great Ramona

RAMONA
(keep it coming)
Oh stop
GAIL

(looking closer)
No really It’s amazing You haven’t
aged one bit

Ramona backs up not wanting to ruin the illusion

JOANNA
This is so incredible It’s like we’re
already family

STAN
Let’s not just stand here Come on in

Ramona follows Stan and the kids to the dining room Gail
stands there frozen She puts on her best game face

GAIL
(to herself)
Everyone deserves a second chance You
can do this

INT DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ramona has joined the family at the dinner table

RAMONA
I’m so sorry I’m late I had to close
up the house and then there was
traffic all the way to Geneva and

WADE
You have a house in Switzerland
Joanna never told me that
She winks

RAMONA
It’s nothing Just eight bedrooms But
you are all welcome to use it anytime
Maybe Christmas We can take the jet

BEN
You have your own plane

at Ben

RAMONA
Itll be my own as soon as the divorce
settles
(to the adults)
We’re in our 14th month of litigation
Twice as long as we were married

GAIL
I’m sorry That must be so hard

RAMONA
Oh no It’ll be worth every penny

Not exactly what Gail meant Ramona’s phone RINGS

RAMONA (CONT’D)
Excuse me This is the wedding
coordinator

Ramona answers her phone

RAMONA (CONTD)
Hi Monique No I don’t see why you
couldn’t land a helicopter on the
beach I agree it’s a great get-away
vehicle But I don’t think we should
tie cans to it See you tomorrow

Ramona hangs up the phone

GAIL
A helicopter

RAMONA
She wanted a hot air balloon but we
couldn’t get the permits in time We
were so lucky to get Monique She’s
booked through 2012 But as luck would
have it the Prince of Mahrain was
mauled by a tiger on safari so she had
a last minute opening

Gail smiles not sure how to respond Marni breaks the
awkward tension

MARNT
I love your dress Ramona It’s Carmen
Marc Valvo right

Gail looks around confused
GAIL
Carmen who I don’t know that one

RAMONA

I’m impressed Marni Valvo has such a

wonderful aesthetic doesn’t he I
absolutely live in his clothes

Gail takes in her own aesthetic Not so wonderful Ramona

addresses Gail’s kids

RAMONA (CONTD)
Your Mom probably hasn’t told you
this but back in school she was
quite the little superstar

MARNT
Oh we know
GAIL
Id hardly say I was a superstar
RAMONA
Don’t be modest Gail Everyone loved
you
(to the kids)
All the girls wanted to be just like
your Mom

Marni smiles She knows the feeling

RAMONA (CONTD)
She was the best At everything
(playful)
It drove some of us so crazy we just
wanted to smack her

GAIL
Well that was a long time ago

RAMONA
Sitting here with you now it feels
like it was just yesterday

Ramona and Gail smile “warmly” at each other

INT FOYER - LATER

Gail and Stan escort Ramona to the front door
crosses through with some dishes

MARNT

Bye Ramona see you tomorrow
RAMONA

Yes We’ll do some career

strategizing

Marni LIGHTS UP as she exits to the kitchen

Marni

RAMONA (CONTD)
I can’t tell you all how happy I am to
be here JJ’s my only family now It
means the world to me to be able to
share in the joy of this wedding with
all of you

Ramona’s eyes start to WELL UP with tears

RAMONA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I’m much more emotional
than I thought I’d be I just can’t
believe I am standing here with Gail
Reynolds after all these years It’s
bringing back so many memories

Gail can’t help but notice how much Ramona has changed
She begins to relax Squeezes Ramona’s hand

GAIL

I’m happy we have this chance to re-
connect too Ramona We have a lot to
catch up on

(then)
Hey what are you doing tomorrow If
youre free I’d love to take you to
brunch

RAMONA
I would love that

Off Ramona all smiles

INT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER

Gail AD-LIBS good-byes as she closes the door

STAN
Wow Small world She seems great

GAIL
(uncertain)
She does doesn’t she

STAN
You sound surprised You two were
friends right

GAIL
Good friends Until our senior Prom
when she freaked out on me and decided
she never wanted to speak to me again
I’m still confused about what
happened

MARNI (PRE-LAP)
Youre confused

INT FAMILY ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Marni poses the question to Ben who watches TV

MARNI
How do you think I feel
(insecure)
Was I that forgettable in high school
Is it possible she really doesn’t
remember me

BEN
Dude you always say you wish you
could forget high school so why do
you even care

MARNI
Because she’s the reason I want to
forget it
(frustrated)
All I wanted was an apology

BEN
Sorry
MARNT
Not from you Benny
BEN
Oh Sorry
(catches himself)
I mean Nevermind
MARNT
(giving up)

Oh what difference does it make I
guess I should be commending her for
turning her life around Maybe Mom’s
right Maybe I just need to drop this
and move on

BEN
Probably a good idea I mean you are
roommates now

Off Marni forcing a smile

INT MARNI’S BEDROOM - LATER

Marni is now dressed for bed She unpacks her suitcase
Joanna ENTERS and takes a seat on one of the twin beds

JOANNA
Hey Roomie Sorry about you having to
share your room Wade and I thought it
would be easier to stay here this
weekend than to drive in and out of
the city

MARNT
It’s fine Don’t worry about it

JOANNA
Wade said you wouldn’t mind sleeping
on the couch but I just couldn’t kick
you out of your own bed

MARNI
Actually that is my bed

Marni smiles and points to the bed Joanna is sitting on

JOANNA
Oh I’m sorry Do you want to trade

MARNI
No It’s cool

Marni carries several HANGING CLOTHES over to the closet
She opens the door to find the closet it COMPLETELY FULL

JOANNA
Gosh you must think I am totally
trying to take over here Let me make
some room for you

Joanna creates a small opening for Marni Marni smiles as
she struggles to load her clothes into the tight space

JOANNA (CONTD)
Marni I want you to know I understand
how difficult this situation must be
for you I know how close you and Wade
are It must have been quite a shock
to find out that he was getting
married so quickly and to someone
you’ve never even met

And even though she promised to drop it

MARNT
Okay seriously Joanna You
honestly don’t remember me

JOANNA
(innocently)
I’m sorry High school’s such a blur
And with all of my charity work and my
responsibilities at the hospital I’m
lucky if I remember what I did last
week Please don’t take it personally

Marni nods and turns away But IN THE MIRROR she can
still see Joanna and Joanna is smiling nervously
There’s a KNOCK at the door

MARNTI JOANNA
Give us a minute PLEASE COME IN

Wade opens the door and ENTERS
WADE
Hey you two I’m not interrupting any
pillow fights am I
Both girls smile sweetly
WADE (CONT’D)
I just wanted to come tuck Joanna in
before she went to bed

JOANNA
Aren’t you the sweetest

She gives Wade a big kiss They keep kissing An awkward
beat as Marni just stands there

MARNI
I’1l just give you two a minute

Marni slowly backs out of the room and EXITS

INT FAMILY ROOM - LATER

Marni again joins Ben on the couch

BEN
Thought you were going to bed

MARNI
My room is a little crowded right now
I’1l just stay here for a little bit
MATCH CUT TO

INT FAMILY ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Marni’s in the same position as we left her only now
she’s dead asleep on the couch in the same clothes from
the night before LAUGHTER comes from the other room
stirring Marni awake She drags herself off the couch
clutching her now-sore back

INT LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER

Gail Stan Wade and Joanna look at old photo albums
Even at 900 am Joanna looks perfect -- a total contrast
to Marni who limps into the room looking like a hot
mess with her crazy bed-head and runny eyeliner

GAIL
What happened to you

MARNTI
I fell asleep on the couch What are
you guys doing

STAN
Looking at the family albums

She now sees a stack of PHOTO ALBUMS on the coffee table
Wade points to a PICTURE

WADE
Check it out Marni Fourth of July
when you got hit by that bottle
rocket

Marni shudders at the memory She squeezes in between
Wade and Joanna on the couch

MARNT
Excuse me can you scoot a little that
way

Joanna does Marni smiles innocently Joanna sees a photo
and GASPS

JOANNA
Ohmygosh Mom you were a Delta Gamma

Marni grimaces Did she just call Gail Mom

GAIL
How did that get in here

INSERT PHOTO DELTA GAMMA BID-DAY Gail and her
“sisters” decked out in their greek letters

JOANNA
I don’t believe this I was a DG too
Secret handshake

They do the HANDSHAKE giggling Marni can’t help but
notice they’re like perfect equals accomplishment-wise

JOANNA (CONTD)
I guess we’re sisters now too
(then)
Marni now you

Joanna holds her hand out to Marni Marni doesn’t move

MARNT
I wasn’t in that sorority
(awkward beat)
Can we turn the page please

Marni jumps ahead in the album Joanna stops her

JOANNA
Look at that I would remember this
from anywhere It’s Wade after he made
the winning touchdown at the State
Championship

INSERT PHOTO STATE CHAMPIONSHIP FOOTBALL GAME Wade is
carried by his teammates In the bg we can barely make
out Marni sprawled out on the field in her mascot outfit
MARNI
So you were at that game Joanna

JOANNA
Of course It was only the most
exciting game ever You were so
awesome that day Wade

MARNT
That’s funny I was at that game too
I can’t believe you don’t remember me

Joanna just smiles Sorry

WADE
Come on You have to remember the
Ridgefield Gator getting clothes-lined
when it stumbled out onto the field

MARNI
Sure stumbled

WADE
That was Marni

JOANNA
Youre kidding

MARNI
I wish Being the mascot was a hard
job But I didn’t complain
(to Joanna pointed)
Even when push came to shove

Marni studies Joanna as she shifts uncomfortably in
chair Ben ENTERS with a large BOX

BEN
Mom Fed Ex just delivered this for
you Who’s Ag Jean

Gail opens the box and pulls out a pile of AG JEANS

GAIL
What is this

MARNT
Well yesterday you said you didn’t
like your new jeans We rep AG so I
asked my friend at corporate to send
you some different styles

JOANNA
You don’t like the jeans we bought

But Gail doesn’t hear her

GAIL
Marni thank you I’m so excited I’m
going to go try these on right now
(MORE )

her

GAIL (CONTD)
You kids better get moving too We’ve
got a lot to do before our dance
lesson

MARNI
Dance lesson

JOANNA
Monique says the wedding dance is a
crucial part of the ceremony We’re
all going

GAIL
Wade don’t forget I’m having brunch
with Ramona so you need to pick-up
Grandma
(then)
She is so excited to see you Marni

JOANNA
She really is It was all she could
talk about the other day at the mall

MARNI
You go shopping with our grandma
JOANNA
All the time Bunny and I are very
close
MARNI
“Bunny”
JOANNA

That’s what Grandpa used to call her
She never told you

MARNI
Of course she did I’m just surprised
she told you

JOANNA
Bunny and I talk about everything I
could listen to her stories all day
MARNTI
What stories Half the time she can’t
remember what she ate for lunch
Wade holds up his car keys

WADE
Let’s hit it ladies

MARNTI
Can I at least take a shower

SMASH CUT TO

INT WADES CAR - DAY (MOVING)

Marni sits in the back of Wade’s BMW She wears different
clothes but her HAIR AND MAKE-UP ARE STILL A MESS She
holds a small compact up to her face From the front

JOANNA
Oh you look fine Marni Don’t worry
Youll have time to wash up before my
bridal shower this afternoon

Joanna turns on the stereo The Captain and Tenille’s “Love
Will Keep Us Together” plays on the radio

JOANNA (CONT’D)
Honey Our song It’s fate

Joanna turns up the volume Wade and Joanna go into
performance mode -- singing into FAKE MICROPHONES and
swaying in their seats Total geeks but truly in love

WADE JOANNA
“Love Love will keep us together
Think of me babe whenever Some
sweet talking girl comes along singing
a song Dont mess around You
gotta be strong Just Stop ‘cause I
really love you”

Marni rolls her eyes she can’t take any more

WADEJOANNA (CONTD) MARNI
(still singing) (top of her lungs)
Stop-- STOP

Startled Wade SLAMS on the brakes The car SCREECHES to
a STOP Wade and Joanna look back at Marni concerned

MARNT
(weakly)
Sorry It was so loud My ears hurt

WADE
Great Now my neck hurts Thanks

Wade pulls the car back onto the road Awkward silence

MARNT
So Wade how’d you pop the question

JOANNA
He asked me in the treehouse

MARNT
The treehouse In our back yard

WADE
It’s my wedding gift to Joanna I’m
having it moved from Mom and Dads
house to our new home once it’s built

MARNI
But that’s our treehouse Wade We
helped dad build it from scratch We
started like six clubs in that thing

WADE
Settle down Marni It’s only a
treehouse
(then)

Hey check it out Ridgefield High in
all its glory

Wade points as they drive past their old HIGH SCHOOL

MARNI
Sure brings back memories

Marni studies Joanna She stares straight ahead silently
bopping her head to the radio

MARNI (CONTD)
If I knew then what I know now I
think I would have done a lot of
things differently

Wade smiles and nods Joanna doesn’t flinch

MARNI (CONTD)
How about you Joanna Any regrets

JOANNA
Well actually

Marni leans in

JOANNA (CONT’D)
If I could go back and do it all over
I think I’d study blind literacy
I’ve so often wished I could read
braille

MARNTI
If I could go back I’d definitely
have more boyfriends You probably had
lots of boyfriends right Joanna

JOANNA
(nervous )
I wouldn’t say lots

MARNTI
I heard one of the cheerleaders had a
different boyfriend at each school in
the district That way she could get
them to buy her expensive stuff
without any of them knowing And once
she bled them dry she’d move on to
some other chump at another school

(then)
(MORE )

MARNI (CONTD)
Didn’t you say you were a cheerleader
Joanna

WADE
What’s your point Marni

MARNI
I figured if she was a cheerleader
she might know who this gold-digger
with low self esteem was I heard she
even dated the Wilson High Principal
for awhile

JOANNA
(too quick)
She did not
(gathers herself)
I mean I never heard that It was
probably a rumor

Steamed Joanna glances at Marni in the rearview mirror
Marni couldn’t be more smug

JOANNA (CONT’D)
Do you guys mind if I change the
music

Joanna flips through her IPOD and selects a song

MUSIC CUE Queen’s “We Are The Champions” Marnis eyes
OPEN WIDE Joanna stares straight ahead swaying her head
to the music silently mouthing the lyrics

JOANNA (CONTD)
I love this song Don’t you guys just
love this song

Wade and Joanna sing

WADE JOANNA
“We are the champions my friends
And well keep on fighting ‘till the
end”

Joanna adjusts the mirror on her sun visor to check
Marnis reaction The girls lock eyes Joanna’s eyes
NARROW She folds up the mirror IT’S ON

EXT GRANDMA BUNNY’S HOUSE - DAY

Marni Wade and Joanna stand at Grandma’s doorstep
Joanna rings the DOORBELL We can hear the doorbell muzak
version of “Do You Know The Way To San Jose”

JOANNA
Don’t you just love that I picked it
out for her a while back

Marni glares at Joanna as she hits the doorbell again
And again There’s no answer

MARNT
Maybe she’s not home

JOANNA
I know she’s home

WADE
Maybe she forgot where the door is

Marni and Wade stifle a laugh as they get a stern glare
from Joanna Suddenly the PEEPHOLE opens up and a
single aged EYE looks out at them

JOANNA
Bunny Thank goodness We were
worried

GRANDMA BUNNY
Joanna

JOANNA
Yes it’s me

GRANDMA BUNNY opens the door Bunny has aged well but is
a little loopy She smiles at Joanna who hugs her

WADE
Hi Grandma

GRANDMA BUNNY
Hello handsome

Wade hugs Bunny

JOANNA
Bunny look who’s here It’s Marni

GRANDMA BUNNY
A pleasure to meet you

MARNI
No Grandma It’s me Marni Your
granddaughter

Grandma looks at Marni confused She leans in to WHISPER
something in Joanna’s ear Joanna giggles

JOANNA
Not Barney Marni Gail’s daughter

off Grandma no idea who this girl is

INT GRANDMA BUNNY’S HOUSE - DAY

The four of them sit having cheese and crackers Joanna
is (of course) right by Grandma’s side while Wade and
Marni sit across from them Marni sees her HIGH SCHOOL
PHOTO on the mantle in all its acned bad hair and thick
glasses glory She notices Joanna giggle at it

MARNT
Grandma I wish you wouldn’t keep that
picture out It’s hideous

GRANDMA BUNNY
Watch your tongue dear That’s my
granddaughter We had to send her
away

MARNT
Nobody sent me away I went to New
York for college Remember

It finally clicks for Grandma

GRANDMA BUNNY
Marni What a wonderful surprise I’m
so glad youre here

Grandma hugs Marni like she’s just realized she was here
From the kitchen we hear a tea kettle WHISTLES

JOANNA
Tea’s ready Be right back

Joanna leaps up and sees to the tea Wade SNIFFS the air
grimaces Something stinks Marni smells it too They
look at each other their eyes saying “It wasn’t me”
They look over at Grandma sitting innocently on the
couch Could she be the culprit Joanna reappears

JOANNA (CONT’D)
Bunny do you want lemon--
(the smell hits her)
Oh wow

Joanna looks to Wade and Marni who shake their heads
knowingly “It wasn’t us” She then looks to Grandma

JOANNA (CONTD)
Uh Bunny Would you like me to take
you to the bathroom

GRANDMA BUNNY
That would be delightful

Nice try kiss-ass Marni leaps to Grandma’s side

MARNT
That’s okay Joanna You’ve done
enough I’1l take her

JOANNA
Don’t be silly I’m happy to do it

MARNI
(back off)
She’s my grandma I’ve got this

JOANNA
Okay Have fun And don’t be long
Almost time for our dance lesson
Satisfied Marni escorts Grandma out of the room

INT BATHROOM —- DAY

Marni gets Grandma into the bathroom but remains outside

MARNT
Okay Grandma You’re flying solo now
Let me know when you’re finished

GRANDMA BUNNY
Thank you Barney

Marni closes the door giving Grandma some privacy
Suddenly Marni hears the horrific sounds of Grandma
BLOWING MUD She GAGS about ready to puke Mercifully
it’s soon followed by a FLUSH But then

GRANDMA BUNNY (0S) (CONT’D)
(calling out)
Okay dear I’m ready for my wipe

Marni goes white

INT RESTAURANT - LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON a hand WIPING down a counter WIDEN TO REVEAL
Gail at the bar talking to a male BARTENDER She’s
totally JACKED UP on caffeine

GAIL
I can’t believe Ramona stood me up I
actually thought she was happy to see
me last night I am so gullible

BARTENDER
You don’t know she stood you up Maybe
something happened

GAIL
(almost hopeful)
Youre right Maybe she got into a car
accident or--
(catching herself)
No Trust me She blew me off It’s
not the first time

BARTENDER
Girls can be so cruel

GAIL
It’s like one day everything was fine
and the next day she was out to get
me It just doesn’t make sense I’ma
good person

(MORE )

GAIL (CONTD)
I’m on the boards of seven charities
My carbon footprint is like this
big

She holds up two fingers less than an inch apart
GAIL (CONTD)
I am not going to let her do this to
me again We’re not teenagers anymore

We’re grown women We can deal with
this in a mature and responsible way

Off Gail determined

EXT CITY STREET - LATER

Were outside the DANCE STUDIO Wade helps Grandma Bunny
out of the car and into the studio Marni seeing her
opportunity catches up to Joanna

MARNT
I gotta give you credit You’ve really
got the whole “good girl” routine
down don’t you

JOANNA
(innocent)
Excuse me
MARNI

You almost had me believing you didn’t
remember me But We Are the Champions
You kinda showed your cards there JJ

Joanna shifts on her feet nervously
JOANNA

Marni we’ve been through this High
school was a long time ago

MARNTI
You don’t think I’1l1 tell Wade do
you

JOANNA

Tell him what

MARNT
That the sociopath who made my life a
living hell is actually his precious
bride-to-be--

Suddenly from off-screen WE HEAR

TIM (0S)
Joanna Is that you

Marni stops mid-rant as they both turn to TIM (a Will
Forte type) walking towards them on the street Tim is
wound so tight he could explode at any moment

JOANNA
(rattled)
Tim Wow What a surprise You’re
looking well

TIM
Actually I’m sick as a dog I was
just at the pharmacy stocking up on
flu medicine

TIM (CONTD)
But thank you for the compliment Boy
I sure wasn’t expecting to run into
you

(then)
You look great Joanna You changed
your hair

Joanna just smiles There is an uncomfortable SILENCE as
Tim gazes at Joanna This is the definition of awkward
Wade returns curious as to who their new friend is

JOANNA
Um Tim this is Wade and Marni
(to Wade)
Tim and I go way back

Tim doesn’t take his eyes off Joanna Marni can’t help
but notice this is painful for Joanna

JOANNA (CONTD)
Will you excuse us for a minute

Joanna leads Tim away for a private conversation

WADE
Who’s the stalker

MARNI
Judging by the way he’s looking at
her I’d say they were definitely
involved

WADE
I don’t think so She’s never
mentioned a guy named Tim

MARNI
You obviously don’t know women very
well bro Kinda makes you wonder what
other Tim’s she has hiding in her
closet

WADE
Alright What is it You’ve been
acting weird ever since you got here
Is it Joanna

Just then
JOANNA
Well it’s been great seeing you But
we should probably get going

Tim trails Joanna back to Wade and Marni
TIM

Wait You wanna get together sometime
Maybe come by the house for a swim

JOANNA
It’s November
TIM
Oh Right How about a movie
JOANNA
(gently)
Tim Wade and I are getting married
TIM
(stunned)

Married II had no idea

JOANNA
This Saturday

Tim wants to curl up and die More awkward silence

TIM
Well I should probably get back to
the office But congratulations to
both of you Awesome news about the
wedding
(to Wade)
Youve got yourself a terrific girl

WADE
Thanks

Tim unceremoniously walks away We follow him for a

moment as he silently bursts into TEARS

JOANNA
I’m sorry That was awkward

MARNI
Not at all

WADE
Who was that

JOANNA
We dated right after high school
It’s a long story

MARNI
I have time You have time Wade

WADE
No because we’re already late

He wraps his arm around Joanna -- almost protectively --
and leads her into the DANCE STUDIO

INT DANCE STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

Gail Stan Ben and Bunny all wait in the studio for
their lesson to begin Wade and Joanna enter followed by
Marni who approaches Gail

GAIL
Hi How was Grandma’s

MARNI
Once she figured out who I was it was
okay When did she get so old Mom

GAIL
Well you haven’t seen her in a year
She can be a bit distracted But she’s
still in there You just have to catch
her at the right moment

ANGLE ON GRANDMA BUNNY In the corner talking to a PLANT

MARNTI
She sure wasn’t distracted when it
came to Joanna

GAIL
Marni stop Your grandmother loves
you very much Please don’t turn
everything into a competition

Suddenly the door to the studio FLIES OPEN revealing
Ramona She’s wearing a FUR COAT

RAMONA
Hi everyone Sorry I’m late

Ramona sidles up to Gail

RAMONA (CONTD)
Hello Gail Isn’t this fun We
havent danced together since gosh
when was it prom

GAIL
Ramona I waited at the restaurant for
over an hour What happened to you

RAMONA
I’m sorry Didn’t you get my text I
had an emergency video conference My
guys in Tokyo have been screaming at
me since the stock market opened And
you know how the Japanese can get

Off Gail no idea how the Japanese can get

RAMONA (CONT’D)
Can we reschedule

Gail sizes up Ramona not sure she buys her story But

GAIL
Of course

Ramona SMILES AND NODS then checks out Gail’s outfit

RAMONA
Is that what you’re wearing

Gail looks down at her conservative dress confused

GAIL
Is there something wrong with it

RAMONA
Of course not It just looks like it
might be a little restricting

And with that Ramona dramatically removes her fur
revealing a BARELY-THERE ENSEMBLE straight out of
DANCING WITH THE STARS Her “dress” is covered with
glitter and rhinestones It’s totally tacky but she
looks amazing Gail is speechless

Just then the lights go out plunging the entire
studio into COMPLETE DARKNESS

WADE
Great Power failure

Nope A SIZZLING LATIN BEAT starts reverberating through
the floorboards of the studio The music BUILDS until a
SINGLE SPOTLIGHT finds

MONIQUE LE FRIQUE (Le Freak-AY) our flamboyant
wedding coordinator She busts out all kinds of DANCE
MOVES making one hell of an entrance She ends with a
flourish the music CUTS OUT and the lights come up

MONIQUE
Bonjour-hello everyone My name is
Monique Le Friqué And I am your
Wedding Extraordinator

When she speaks she slips into a THICK FRENCH ACCENT
but only for certain words

MONIQUE (CONTD)
You may ask yourselves “What is a
Wedding Extraordinator”

(like it’s obvious)

That is simple it is I Monique Le
Friqué Every wedding tells a story
and I am the auteur

(MORE )

MONIQUE (CONTD)
I shall see to every detail no matter
how infintesi infinitesi no
matter how small Think of me as the
engine room of your Love Boat

Our group exchanges looks not sure what to make of her

MONIQUE (CONTD)
And our first port of call is a very
crucial but often overlooked part of
the celebration The wedding dance
The wedding dance symbolizes the
passion and romance Wade and Joanna
feel for one another So I Monique Le
Friqué have choreographed a special
routine for just this occasion

(then)

But being a good dancer is not just
about learning the steps It’s about
getting inside the music Feeling the
rhythm in your bones You have to give
100 percent -- like a dance tsunami
crashing down on the Rhythm Nation

Gail and Marni exchange a look trying not to laugh
Joanna and Ramona have never been more focused

MONIQUE (CONTD)
Id like to introduce my assistant for
the day the owner of this lovely
studio Timothy

Tim enters the studio Yes the Tim we just met Joanna’s
JAW DROPS However Marni’s EYES LIGHT UP with the
possibility that this might go very badly
MONIQUE (CONTD)

Timothy has graciously offered to help

demonstrate some basic steps while I

assist you all on the floor But he

will need a partner Any volunteers

MARNI
How ‘bout it Joanna

Joanna cuts her eyes at Marni But Ramona’s hand shoots
straight up in the air

RAMONA
I will

PRE-LAP SAUCY LATIN SALSA MUSIC

Alas Marni is the odd man out and dances alone Monique
paces like a warden on a cell block looking for
mistakes

MONIQUE

partner Eyes front

Terrified Ben stares straight ahead But at his height
he’s staring directly into Grandma’s AMPLE CLEAVAGE

BACK TO MARNI As Wade and Joanna GLIDE by
JOANNA
Sorry We were expecting more people

Guess they couldn’t get out of work

MARNT
It’s fine Don’t worry about it

That’s when the door to the studio OPENS and a good
looking guy CHARLIE enters

WADE
Charlie You made it

Wade and Joanna go to greet their friend

WADE (CONT’D
Marni You remember Charlie right

Marni freezes Her mind reels with IMAGES we’ve seen
before only this time we get more information

locks eyes with JJ and then PLOWS into the CUTE FOOTBALL
JOCK This time we see his face it’s YOUNG CHARLIE

BACK TO PRESENT

MARNI
Uh yeah I remember Charlie

Marni is shell-shocked Totally unprepared to see her old
crush She whispers to Gail as she and Stan dance by

MARNI (CONTD)
Nobody told me Charlie was in the
wedding I would have showered

GAIL
(duh)
Charlie and Wade have been best
friends since high school Of course

Charlie and Wade approach Marni

WADE
Perfect timing man You’re going to
dance with Marni

Charlie extends a hand to Marni She almost melts He
escorts her to the dance floor Monique breezes by

MONIQUE
And who is the dashing late arrival I
am already liking what I am seeing

She’s focused on his BUTT

MONIQUE (CONTD)
But not from you Marni Your Rumba
has the style and grace of a Roomba

ANGLE ON GAIL AND STAN DANCING NEAR RAMONA AND TIM Gail
can’t help notice Ramona’s well-toned figure

GAIL
Youve really managed to stay in great
shape since high school Ramona

RAMONA
Well you had kids I had a pilates
instructor

Off Gail not sure if that was an insult or not
ANGLE ON MARNI AND CHARLIE Marni struggles to keep her

cool counting her steps and trying not to be that 14-
year-old dork again Charlie gestures to Wade and Joanna

CHARLIE
They make a great couple don’t they
MARNT
(seriously)
Uh sure Charlie do you remember JJ--
sorry Joanna -- from High School
CHARLIE

Nah but I don’t remember a lot of
people from high school

Marni nods sadly

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
But I totally remember you

Now she melts for sure Bolstered by this she dances like
she’s never danced before eager to show Joanna she’s got
moves Joanna not about to let Marni show her up kicks

her dance into high gear Wade tries to keep up

ANGLE ON STAN AND GAIL Attempting to Samba

MONIQUE
Stan your legs are like two pogo
sticks I want you to bring the smooth
and sexy Like a snarling young tiger
I want to hear you ROAAAAR

STAN
(getting into it)
Ramona watches Stan and Gail So in love She hates it
RAMONA
Tim why don’t you let me drive for a

while

INT DANCE STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

NEEDLE DROP “FINALLY” by Ce Ce Peniston (hip hop remix)

Ramona and Tim are totally showing off Ramona with one
eye on Gail Tim with one eye on Joanna both of them
feeling like they have something to prove Ramona gives
Gail a cocky smile

RAMONA
Don’t try this at home kids This
one’s just for professionals

MONIQUE

Look at those hips of fury Not even
the Richter scale could measure those
moves

Gail stares at Ramona who shakes her perfect butt as she
UNDULATES around Tim Despite her basically using Tim as
a stripper pole he just stares sadly Joanna oblivious

GAIL
Would you look at Ramona I mean
honestly what is she trying to prove

STAN

Well if I had her body
GAIL

Youd what
STAN

Id shut my mouth before the next
stupid thing came out

Now feeling competitive Gail awkwardly begins to MIMIC
Ramona’s moves She CIRCLES Stan repeatedly shaking her
own back yard Stan busts out a few “moves” of his own
They look ridiculous

STAN (CONTD)

ANGLE ON GRANDMA BUNNY Mimicking Gail’s moves She
shakes her butt as she circles Ben Ben is miserable

MONIQUE
(re Gail and Ramona)
Yes-yes-yes This is what I am talking
about Passion Determination Like
two lionesses fighting over dominion
of the music

Ramona breaks away from Tim and shimmies past Gail

RAMONA
Careful It’s not good to over-exert
yourself when you’re not in optimum
shape

GAIL
No pain no gain right

Ramona gives her a TIGHT LITTLE SMILE and DANCES OFF
Gails eyes NARROW She “shortens” her shirt up to her
mid-thigh by TUCKING IT INTO HER BELT IT’S ON

Gail pulls Stan out to the MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR where all
of the women square off Each trying to outshine their
respective nemesis in this IMPROMPTU DANCE OFF

ANGLE ON RAMONA Queen of the dance Gail can’t take it

GAIL (CONTD)
“Nobody puts baby in a corner”
(off Stan confused)

You remember Patrick Swayze

He nods Gail turns and strides away from him

STAN
Wait What about him

But Gail’s already at the opposite end of the room She
starts running towards Stan Yep Shes gonna do it
the lift from “Dirty Dancing” Meanwhile

ANGLE ON JOANNA She eyes Marni dancing with Charlie
Unseen by Wade she SLIPS OFF HER SHOE and KICKS IT
ACROSS THE FLOOR towards Marni

JOANNA
Oh No My shoe

As the shoe SKITTERS ACROSS THE FLOOR towards Marni

BACK TO STAN Who is like a deer in headlights not sure
what he’s supposed to be doing as Gail runs towards him
like a locomotive Suddenly Gail LEAPS INTO THE AIR
just like Jennifer Grey

and no one is more surprised than Stan who completely
chokes as she essentially hits him with a FLYING TACKLE
They CRASH to the floor in a heap

BACK TO MARNI Just as Joanna’s shoe slides right under
Marni’s heel Marni TRIPS FORWARD and HEAD BUTTS CHARLIE

CHARLIE
Ow

Charlie LOSES HIS GRIP on Marni and she goes flying
LANDING ON HER BUTT right next to Gail and Stan who are
now sprawled across the dance floor It looks like a
pileup on the freeway Marni looks up at

ANGLE ON CHARLIE His lip is BLOODIED and SWOLLEN Marni
CRINGES horrified

ANGLE ON JOANNA As Ramona joins her Clearly the
victors they look down upon the humiliated Marni and
Gail Their faces show concern but is that a hint of
satisfaction we see in their eyes

EXT DANCE STUDIO - LATER
Stan and Wade help Gail as she LIMPS her way to the car

STAN
What the heck was that

GAIL
“Nobody puts baby in a corner” Dirty
Dancing C’mon Stan everyone knows
what that means

STAN
I’m sorry When you said “Patrick
Swayze” I thought you meant the one
where he played the ghost

WADE
Is everything okay with you and
Ramona Mom Seemed like you two were
kinda going at it in there

GAIL
Don’t be ridiculous Wade Ramona and
I were just having a little fun We
adore each other
Stan and Wade exchange a look not convinced

INT HOME OFFICE - LATER

We’re CLOSE on a picture of 18 year-old Gail and Ramona
Happy Smiling Total BFF’s WIDEN TO REVEAL

Gail at her desk looking through her old photo album
Picture after picture reveals Ramona and Gail in happier
times Finally we land on the HOMECOMING PHOTO

(This is the same photo Marni admired in the school
hallway) We see Gail in her crown flanked by her court
but this time WE NOTICE RAMONA sitting right next to
Gail And in this photo Ramona looks pissed Gail is
surprised

GAIL
Huh That’s weird

MARNI (0S)
What’s weird

Startled Gail looks up to find Marni in the doorway

GAIL
Ramona looks so mad in this picture
I’ve never noticed it before

Marni looks at the picture Then echoing Gail

MARNTI
What’s past is past right
(then)
Have you seen Ben

GAIL
He’s playing outside

As Marni turns to exit

GAIL (CONT’D)
Marni I appreciate you making an
effort with Joanna There are always
going to be challenges in life but
growing up means learning to deal with
those challenges in a mature way You
are doing that

Marni smiles sweetly

EXT DRIVEWAY - A COUPLE MINUTES LATER

Marni paces Ben practices on his skateboard

MARNI
Come on the old “accidental shoe
kick” Please

BEN
So I guess this means you didn’t get
your apology

MARNI
Yeah I don’t think there’s going to
be any apology But I was right Ben
She remembers me This is all a part
of her little act I can’t believe
they’re all falling for it I gave
Wade way more credit than this

(MORE)

MARNI (CONTD)
She’s got him totally brainwashed Did
you know he’s not even eating carbs
now

BEN
At least he’s not wearing a blindfold

MARNI
But him giving her the treehouse as a
wedding gift is like the icing on the
cake

BEN
What He can’t do that That tree
house is mine now

Gail yells from an UPSTAIRS WINDOW
GAIL (0S)

Ben we need to leave for baseball
You ready

BEN
But practice doesn’t start for 45
minutes

GAIL

I’m dropping you off early Monique’s
got a million errands for me to run
and I’ve got to get the seating chart
over to Ramona’s hotel

BEN
I thought the whole point of having a
Wedding Extraordinator was that she
does everything for you

GAIL
Huh Good point
(then)
Get in the car

Gail disappears back inside

MARNI

We’ve gotta do something Benny We’ve
got 48 hours to save Wade from making
the biggest mistake of his life He
has no idea what he’s getting himself
into What she’s capable of

(then)
We have to tell him the truth It’s
for his own good I just need to get
him alone for thirty-minutes

BEN
Good luck They’re always together

Marni smiles wheels turning

INT OLSEN LIVING ROOM - DAY

Wade watches football Joanna sits next to him nibbling
on BABY CARROTS The phone RINGS Wade answers

WADE
Hello One minute

Wade hands the phone to Joanna

WADE (CONTD)
It’s the florist

EXT TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME

Marni and Ben sit in the tree house Ben holds her phone

BEN
Why do I have to do this

MARNI
Because her florist is a man Oh and
by the way he’s French
OFF a panicked Ben
INTERCUT WITH

Worried Joanna grabs the phone from Wade

JOANNA

Ben hangs up the phone quickly Marni glares at him

MARNI
What was that

Just then we hear a car door SLAM in front of the house
Joanna SQUEALS down the street in her car Ben beams

BEN
That was awesome Go

EXT OLSEN RESIDENCE - DAY

Marni waits for Gail’s car to pull out of the driveway
before dashing across the front yard She goes to open
the front door It’s locked She KNOCKS There’s no
answer She rings the DOORBELLnothing

MARNI
Perfect

Marni runs to

THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

She checks the side door LOCKED She peeks through a
window and can barely make out Wade lying on his back
doing CRUNCHES his IPOD on as he watches the football
game in the family room

MARNI
Wade

He can’t hear a thing

EXT OLSEN BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Marni lets herself into the backyard through the gate As
she dashes across the yard The SPRINKLERS GO OFF
Blinded by water Marni trips on a SPRINKLER HEAD turning
its gentle spray into a STRONG JET OF WATER that shoots
directly into Joanna’s OPEN BEDROOM WINDOW the water
hits Joanna’s WEDDING DRESS which hangs in the window

MARNI
Oh no no no no

Marni frantically tries to redirect the sprinkler away
from the window but it’s no use The spray is too
strong Her only choice is to block the stream with her
body like a HUMAN SHIELD

INT OLSEN LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

As Wade does his crunches WE CAN SEE Marni through the
window getting PELTED by the sprinkler It looks painful

EXT BACKYARD - SAME TIME

Marni reaches for anything to block her body from getting
battered by the spray But every time she steps even an
inch away Joanna’s DRESS GETS BLASTED with water She’s
trapped Finally after what seems like an eternity the
sprinklers TURN OFF Marni looks up to see Joanna’s
wedding dress SOAKED on a hanger

MARNI
Great

INT OLSEN RESIDENCE —- DAY

A battered and drenched Marni enters the family room

WADE
What happened to you

MARNT
Funny you should ask It’s kind of a
long story Eight years to be exact
Can we talk

WADE
Can it wait Joanna’s gonna be back
soon and I wanted to sneak in a run

MARNI
Great I’1ll join you
WADE
(laughing)
You
MARNI

Why is that so funny

WADE
When we signed up for that charity 5K
you hitched a ride to the finish line

MARNTI
How many times do I have to tell you
I had a rock in my shoe

WADE
Okay But I’m warning you I’m
training for a Triathlon Five miles

MARNT
(cocky )

INT FANCY HOTEL - DAY

Gail LIMPS through the lobby carrying a LARGE SEATING
CHART She hardly blends in with the wealthy hotel
patrons in their Chanel and Louis Vuitton

INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Ramona paces around her LUXURIOUS SUITE on the phone
She’s emotional clearly off her game

RAMONA
but Michael I know we can work
this out

Suddenly there’s a knock at the door

RAMONA (CONTD)
Can you hold on a second

She covers the phone and opens the door Gail stands
there smiling holding out the seating chart

GAIL
Hi Sorry to stop by unannounced
Monique asked me to get this to you
She needs a finalized seating chart by
the end of the day
(then)
Also I was hoping we could talk

RAMONA
Oh Sure

Ramona reluctantly motions her in
RAMONA (CONTD)
This is kind of an important call Can

you give me a minute

INT BATHROOM - A MINUTE LATER

Gail washes her hands at the sink and notices a pair of

HUGE DIAMOND EARRINGS on the counter They probably cost
more than Marni’s college education Gail cannot resist

the urge to try the earrings on

Sshe holds an earring up to her ear but because her
hands are wet and slippery she drops one earring into
the sink where it slides down the drain She panics

She tries to squeeze her fingers down into the drain to
retrieve the earring No luck She looks for anything to
reach into the drain There’s nothing She’s screwed

Gail uses the counter for support as she lowers her stiff
and achy body onto the floor Suffering through her pain
she contorts her body into a ball and tries to squeeze
under the sink to reach the drain pipe Suddenly from
outside the door

RAMONA (0S)
What are you doing

Gail freezes Then weakly

GAIL
One second

INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

But Ramona was not speaking to Gail She is still on the
phone She paces out of the room

RAMONA
Please can’t we just have this
conversation when we’re face to face

INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Gail’s legs are now twisted around the toilet as she
frantically tries to unscrew the U-shaped TRAP from the
drain pipe She turns the gasket with all her might
OWWWWWW Her back kills Finally the seal loosens -- and
the trap comes off But the WATER COMES WITH IT SPRAYING
HER IN THE FACE as the earring drops to the floor

INT HOTEL ROOM - A COUPLE MINUTES LATER

Gail now walking with a serious LIMP exits the
bathroom Even with her wet hair slicked back she tries
to act as if everything is perfectly normal She hears
Ramona still on the phone She’s sounds totally defeated

RAMONA (0S)
Well if that’s how you feel then I
guess there’s nothing left to say I’m
sorry too

CLICK Gail can see Ramona through the door She stands
before a mirror wiping away her tears Gail approaches

GAIL
Ramona Is everything okay

For the briefest second Ramona looks as if she might
fall apart But then

RAMONA
I’m fine My allergies are going
crazy Must be the gardens

Gail knows she’s lying

RAMONA (CONT’D)
What happened to you Did you take a
shower or something

GAIL
(deer in headlights)
Uh your sink had a little leak I
tried to fix it but

Ramona doesn’t care She’s on to the next thing

RAMONA
You wanted to talk about something
GAIL
Yes I did I do But if this is a bad
time
RAMONA

I told you Everything’s fine
Gail steadies herself Showtime

GAIL
Okay Ramona I’m a big believer in
closure And I just want you to know
that whatever it is that happened
between us in the past is in the past
As far as I am concerned those days
are over

RAMONA
(gently)
I appreciate that but I’m running a
Fortune 500 company here I don’t have
time to worry about things that
happened 30 years ago

GAIL
Actually Ramona What did happen 30
years ago Was it something I did

RAMONA
Gail I’ve moved on Don’t you think
it’s time you did the same

Gail nods now feeling a little foolish The hotel phone
RINGS Ramona moves to grab it

RAMONA (CONTD)
Can you excuse me for one second
(into phone)
Hello Yes Brad I have those figures
right here Go ahead conference Marco
in

Ramona indicates “This could take a while Sorry Gail
waves and nods “Ill let myself out” Ramona disappears
into the bedroom As Gail walks to the door she notices
some ALUMINUM CANS in a small WASTE BASKET She shakes
her head in disapproval

GAIL
Earth First Ramona

She plucks the ALUMINUM CANS from the basket and throws
them in her purse She EXITS

EXT PARK —- RUNNING TRAIL - DAY

Marni is DRENCHED in sweat and barely able to pick her
feet up as she lags behind Wade He makes a U-turn
circling back around to keep pace with Marni

WADE
How you holding up

MARNI
(gasping for air)
Tortoise and the hare bro I’m just
pacing myself

Marni struggles for a breath

MARNI (CONTD)
I’m really glad we’re doing this
There’s something I’ve been wanting to
talk to you about It’s about Joanna--

WADE

Isn’t she amazing She’s not like
anybody else I’ve ever met She’s the
most honest caring and loyal person
I’ve ever known

(then)
And she totally digs you by the way
She can’t stop talking about how
psyched she is to have you as a
sister

MARNT
Wade there’s something I think you
should know before you get married
After all Joanna’s not just marrying
you she’s marrying all of us

She catches her breath and gauges his reaction Wade
slows down He suddenly gets serious

WADE
Marni I think I know what you’re
about to say and I want you to know
I’m really glad you brought it up
I’m surprised you took this long

MARNTI
Really

WADE
I hope you know I couldn’t marry
Joanna unless I knew I had your
blessing

MARNT
Really That’s great

WADE
Marrying Joanna is the most important
thing I’ll ever do And I couldn’t do
it without knowing I had your support

MARNI
In that case--

WADE
I can’t tell you how much it means to
me to know you love her as much as I
do
(then)
Thanks sis You’re the best

Her face falls What just happened Wade checks his
watch

WADE (CONTD)
I gotta get back Joanna’s going to
kill me Mind if I speed ahead

Marni’s nods speechless Wade takes off down the path
leaving her alone She stops buckles over hands on the
knees She looks around Nothing but trees

MARNI
Where am I

EXT WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

Marni cuts through the woods She’s WHACKED in the face
by a series of low branches and bushes

MARNI
Oww Darn it Where is the trail

She tries to fend off the branches but her MOMENTUM
carries her downhill rather quickly She’s in an
unintentional SPRINT now

MARNI (CONTD)
Ow Cramp Cramp Cramp

Her foot SNAGS on a large root sending her flying
through the air like Superman

INT OLSEN KITCHEN - DAY

Gail grabs a box from the PANTRY She closes the pantry
door REVEALING SOME SORT OF SWAMP MONSTER CLAWING AT
THE KITCHEN WINDOW Gail SCREAMS Then she realizes this
monster looks a lot like

GAIL
Marni

Yep it’s Marni Caked in mud Twigs and branches stick
out from her rat’s nest of hair

MARNI
(through the window)
Mommy

INT OLSEN RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER

Gail helps a battered and itchy Marni into the family
room placing her on the couch Wade and Ben ENTER

BEN
What happened to you
MARNI
I took a shortcut
WADE
Through the Congo
MARNI
I’m fine
GAIL

No she’s not The bad news is I think
she pulled a muscle in her leg The
good news is she can’t feel it because
of all the ant bites

Joanna barges through the front door

JOANNA
You guys will not believe what just
happened I think my florist has
completely lost his mind

Joanna notices Marni for the first time

JOANNA (CONTD)
What happened

MARNT
It’s only a cramp

GAIL
And a few thousand ant bites She fell
into a fire ant colony
Wade helps Marni to the couch Joanna goes into full

nurse mode looking Marni over carefully
JOANNA
(dead serious)
With this many bites she could go
into anaphylactic shock
GAIL

Youre the nurse Joanna What should
we do

All eyes turn to Joanna

JOANNA
We need Crisco Stat

OFF Marni’s concerned look

INT OLSEN RESIDENCE - A BIT LATER

Marni’s covered head-to-toe in THICK LARD She looks
a HUMAN BIRTHDAY CAKE

JOANNA (CONT’D)
The Crisco will keep the swelling
down
(to Gail)
Did you say she hurt her leg

Gail nods

MARNT
It’s fine Really Joanna You’ve done
more than enough

JOANNA
If it’s a muscle strain I can help
work it out

MARNI
Let’s just wait until Dad gets off his
shift

GAIL

Marni Joanna wants to help Don’t be
so stubborn

JOANNA
After all we can’t have you limping
around my bridal shower this
afternoon

like

Marni sucks it up and plays nice She sticks her bum leg
out Joanna grabs Marnis leg and starts MASSAGING it

MARNT
Ouch Take it easy

GAIL
Marni Where are your manners

JOANNA
Don’t worry it’s only a reflex A
response to the pain I know she
doesn’t mean it Right Marni

Joanna looks at Marni innocently And even underneath all
that Crisco we can see Marnis eyes turn to SLITS

MARNI
(teeth clenched)
Right Joanna

Joanna continues to aggressively work out the cramp as
Marni writhes in pain

JOANNA
It’s really tight in there

MARNT
Ow Are you sure you know what you’re
doing

JOANNA
Marni I’m a professional Trust me
I do this with all my patients

Joanna DIGS into her leg for the last time Marni KICKS
Joanna in the stomach sending her sprawling onto her ass
in the middle of floor All eyes on Marni

MARNI
Reflex

INT CAR - DAY (MOVING) - LATER

Gail drives with Marni to the bridal shower Marni in
the passenger seat wears her old COKE BOTTLE GLASSES and
has several red ANT BITES -- which look like ACNE -- on
her face Gail looks at her watch she’s frustrated

GAIL
I can’t believe we’re going to be late
to Joanna’s shower I’m the mother of
the groom How is that going to look

MARNT
Not nearly as bad as me in these
stupid glasses I can’t believe you
are making me wear these

GAIL
Well we can’t fish your contacts out
of that ant bed so I just thought it
would be nice if you could see

MARNI
I’m walking into a firing squad Mom
What would be nice is if I could have
a blindfold Too bad Dad’s not coming
to this thing

Marni holds a compact mirror up to her face and
frantically applies concealer to her bites

MARNI (CONTD)
Look at me These ant bites look like
zits I’m sixteen again It’s like
nothing has changed since high school
Those girls are going to eat me alive

GAIL
Stop being so dramatic Joannas
friends are lovely I’m sure by the
end of this party you’ll all be good
friends and live happily ever after

MARNI
Fairy tales end happily ever after
High school was a horror movie This
weekend is the sequel

Gail eyes Marni

GAIL
You know honey it’s times like these--

MARNT
You can’t help yourself can you
You can’t not offer up some little
self-help nugget that’s supposed to
magically fix every situation

GAIL
Someday you’ll appreciate my wisdom

MARNT
And maybe someday youll appreciate
your wisdom

Gail gives her a look Huh

MARNI (CONTD)
Oh please Mom There’s obviously
something going down between you and
Ramona You looked like you wanted to
rip her face off at that dance lesson
yesterday So preach to me all you
want about letting go and being the
bigger person but maybe you need to
start taking your own advice

Gail considers Marni’s words as the car rolls to a STOP
at a RED LIGHT That’s when Gail notices

Ramona in her Porsche in the lane next to them Ramona
and Gail LOCK EYES Ramona throws her the tiniest smile
before REVVING her engine We HEAR Heart’s “Barracuda” on
the radio Gail smirks turning it up

GAIL
Honey it’s not easy being a mom
There’s no rule book Every day you
just have to trust your instincts and
hope that not doing something to screw
up your kids It’s a lot of pressure

Gail’s eyes dart from the red light back to Ramona She
gives Ramona a smile of her own You wanna go Ramona’s
REVVING ENGINE is her answer

GAIL (CONTD)
I feel a profound sense of
responsibility

CLOSE ON Gail’s RIGHT FOOT near the gas pedal She
furtively SLIPS OFF HER SHOE Cant race in heels

GAIL (CONTD)
because I know that everything I do
will have a lasting effect on your
life

Marni thinks her mother’s looking her square in the eye
but she’s looking past her at Ramona The two drivers
stare each other down like street racers at Thunder Road

GAIL (CONTD)
That’s why I want you know that what
I’m about to do is very very wrong

Marni looks at her confused The light TURNS GREEN And
Gail GUNS IT “Barracuda” becomes our sound-track as Gail
tears off in a cloud of SMOKE and BURNING RUBBER Marni’s
about to pee her pants

MARNTI
Mom what are you doing

GAIL
I told you I hate being late

Gail HAULS ASS down the street leaving Ramona way back
in her REAR VIEW MIRROR She BANGS HER FIST triumphantly
on the steering wheel

GAIL (CONTD)
YES YES YES

PRE-LAP A POLICE SIREN

SMASH CUT TO

EXT CAR - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

A poker-faced COP stands at Gail’s window writing up a
ticket Marni just SHAKES HER HEAD in disbelief

COP
Ma’am do you know how fast you were
going

GAIL

I’m sorry officer I don’t know what

came over me I never do this kind of

thing I’m usually a very safe driver
Unimpressed the cop hands her a ticket and walks away

INT COUNTRY CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

Gail and Marni ENTER an OCEAN-THEMED bridal shower
already in progress The room has been transformed into
an underwater fantasy complete with blue twinkle lights
and walls draped in blue fabric to resemble water

Suddenly a sickly foghorn-like sound fills the room
Everyone turns towards the SIDE DOOR to see an
ATTENDANT blowing a CONCH SHELL as MONIQUE LE FRIQUE
enters through a THICK SEA OF BUBBLES

MONIQUE
Bonjour-hello everyone Welcome to
Joanna’s bridal shower Since Wade and
Joanna’s romance blossomed at the
beach it’s only fitting that we begin
their wedding story in a sea of
romance

She does that Vanna White “all this can be yours” arm
gesture and then glides into the party The CAMERA
FOLLOWS her and picks up

-MARNI her ant bites mostly concealed and Joanna who
talk to the now-grown BITCHY GIRLS from high school

JOANNA
Girls say hi to Wade’s sister Marni

BITCHY GIRLS
Hi Marni

The girls wear Stepford smiles and slightly different
versions of the same perfect outfit

JOANNA
Marni lives in New York now

TAYLOR a real know-it-all

TAYLOR
I hear the crime in the city has
really risen in the last few years
Shame

MARNI
Well I have a doorman He makes me
feel very safe

KENDALL huge at 7 months pregnant

KENDALL
Oh does that mean there isn’t anyone
special in your life

MARNT
No But I’m not really looking--

The Bitchy Girls let out a collective GASP This is
clearly the saddest thing they’ve ever heard

TAYLOR
Aww you must be so lonely

MARNT
Not really I’m pretty busy with--

Kendall rubs her baby bump and offers Marni a sad smile

KENDALL
Guess that means you don’t have any
little ones yet

MARNI
Uh no

They SIGH This is the second saddest thing

TAYLOR
Don’t worry If you can’t finda
husband I know a doctor in Newport
who is on the cutting edge of
geriatric reproduction
(whispering)
I know a good dermatologist in New
York too if you want to try and get
that acne under control

Marni is in hell Monique approaches She holds a
decorative basket full of LARGE CONCH SHELLS

MONIQUE

Girls please take a conch so you can
hear the sounds of Wade and Joanna’s
love There is one for each of you

The girls each take one Kendall holds it up to her ear

KENDALL
Ohmygosh There’s music

MONIQUE
But of course there is Each on has an
iPod Nano inside filled with a
special playlist to commemorate Wade
and Joanna’s wedding

Marni takes a conch and shakes it

MARNI
Awesome How do we get the iPod out

Monique STARES DAGGERS at Marni

MONIQUE
It does not come out It was meant to
be enjoyed inside the shell The
acoustics are better than any
headphone commercially available

TAYLOR
So we’re supposed to walk around
wearing a giant shell on our head

Monique nods yes Just then Grandma Bunny BE-BOPS by
wearing a conch on the side of her head Marni sees
Ramona across the room and quickly makes her escape

OVER BY THE GIFT TABLE

Gail arranges gifts She sees Marni and Ramona
approaching chatting it up like old friends

RAMONA
Hi Gail Sorry about that speeding
ticket I thought you saw the cop He
was trailing us for like three blocks

GAIL
Yeah well

Determined to stay positive and reconnect

GAIL (CONTD)
Love that dress Ramona Lemme guess
Volvo right

RAMONA
A Volvo is a car This is a Valvo

Marni winces at the gaffe Gail tries to laugh it off

MARNI
Guess what Mom Ramona invited me
to fly back to NY with her on her jet

career advice

RAMONA

Ramona notices SOMEONE across the room
RAMONA (CONTD)

Jarus Didn’t anyone leave this town

GAIL
Youd be surprised how many people
stayed It’s nice All our kids grew
up together and now they’re friends
(then)
So you never had any kids

RAMONA
(wistful)
Kind of hard to have a family when
youre never in the same time zone for
more than two weeks at a time That’s
why JJs so precious to me She’s the
closest I’1l come to being a mom

GAIL
Well it must be exciting to have such
a high-powered career I’d love to
hear more about your job

RAMONA
Believe me there are plenty of days I
wish I could be in your shoes

GAIL
(flattered)

It must be wonderful

Gail smiles awkwardly That’s when

Ramona pleased with herself turns to Gail who can
barely look her in the eye

RAMONA
Not as special as used underwear but
I think she liked it

GAIL
(annoyed)
That was very generous Ramona

RAMONA
That was nothing Wait until you see
the wedding gift

Ramona goes to give Joanna a HUG Marni approaches Gail

MARNT
Isn’t Ramona the greatest It’s like I
have a real mentor now Don’t you love
her boots She always looks perfect I
wonder if she has a stylist

Gail rolls her eyes as Marni drones on and on Monique
APPROACHES wearing a GOLD LAME CHEFS HAT and APRON

MONIQUE
Attencion ladies attencion I have a
special surprise Please gather
‘round

Everyone gathers around Monique

MONIQUE (CONTD)
It is a magical moment when a bride
first lays eyes on her groom So as a
a special treat I have recreated
Joannas first memory of her
beloved in cake

The ATTENDANT wheels out a LIFE-SIZED CAKE OF WADE
depicted singing into a MICROPHONE (as he was when Joanna
first saw him doing karaoke) It’s like a frosting-
covered American Idol Scary real Like Madame-Tussauds-
real The girls are aghast Monique whips out a KNIFE

MONIQUE (CONTD)
Joanna would you like to cut the
first piece

JOANNA
Oh you go ahead I wouldn’t feel
right about stabbing my future
husband

Monique then CHOPS OFF Cake-Wade’s hand to reveal RED
VELVET CAKE inside resembling blood GASPS all around

MONIQUE
Who wants the first piece

The girls look at each other horrified

INT COUNTRY CLUB - A MINUTE LATER

Marni carrying a piece of Cake-Wade’s FACE searches for
a place to sit at one of the tables around the room She
finds an open seat

TAYLOR
Sorry This seat’s taken

She moves to another open chair

KENDALL
Saved

Marni may as well be in the school cafeteria again
Finally she finds an open seat next to Grandma

GRANDMA BUNNY
Hello I’m Bunny What’s your name

MARNT
Grandma It’s me Marni
(then)
The one you had to send away

GRANDMA BUNNY
Oh Marni That’s right Sorry dear
Don’t ever get old

Joanna taps on a wine glass to get the crowd’s attention

JOANNA
Ladies I’d like to make a toast To
my handful of closest friends thank
you for giving me a heart full of joy
It is my honor to have you standing by
my side this weekend Here’s just a
small token of my appreciation

Joanna picks up a stack of BOXES and delivers them around
the room She approaches Marni whispers into her ear

JOANNA (CONTD)
I picked yours out special Marni
Hope you like it

Joanna smiles and quickly walks away Marni unwraps the
box to find MONOGRAMMED STATIONERY Unfortunately for
Marni her initials spell out “MOO”

GRANDMA BUNNY
I told your mother “Olivia” was a
terrible middle name She wouldn’t
listen

MARNI
(tearing up)
Does it ever get easier Grandma

GRANDMA BUNNY
What dear

MARNTI

Everything This Life

(then)
In high school these girls wouldn’t
talk to me because I was a loser But
here I am six years later I did
something with my life but in this
dumb small town I still don’t fit in

GRANDMA BUNNY
Marni don’t let the way those girls
treated you in high school bring you
down

Marni looks at Grandma with genuine surprise

MARNI
You remember

GRANDMA BUNNY
Who could forget Those girls were
terrible to you Especially that JJ
She’s lucky she didn’t show her face
around here

Marni realizes Grandma has no idea that Joanna IS JJ

GRANDMA BUNNY (CONT’D)
I always wanted to do something to fix
it but it wasn’t my place We are our
experiences Marni That terrible time
made you the strong girl you are
today

(then)

Those girls don’t have the power to
make you feel bad anymore Marni So
don’t you give it to them
MARNT
(suddenly empowered)
Youre right Grandma Those girls
don’t have that power anymore

And just like that

GRANDMA BUNNY
What power is that dear

Grandma is gone Marni sighs

MARNI
Nevermind I’1l be right back

GRANDMA BUNNY
(yelling after her)
If you see my granddaughter tell her
I need to go to the bathroom
As Marni makes her escape

MARNT
Will do

INT BATHROOM - DAY

Marni enters the bathroom to find Joanna alone fixing

her make-up in the mirror

JOANNA
Hey sis Isn’t this a blast

MARNTI
Look I’ve had about enough of the
games You can make this real easy on
yourself All you have to do is
apologize Apologize for all the stuff
you did to me in high school and for
all the stuff you’re doing now You do
that and I’ll keep my mouth shut
about all of it

Joanna applies her lipstick with precision

JOANNA
And what exactly do you think you
could say that I’d be so afraid of

MARNTI

Oh please You’re afraid of what Wade
will do when he finds out what you did
to me then and what you’re doing to
me now

JOANNA

What I’m doing to you You started
this You’ve been pushing my buttons
ever since you came home

MARNT
I think I had a pretty darn good
reason to be a little peeved I could
have told Wade but I didn’t for his
sake

JOANNA
This has nothing to do with Wade

MARNI
Then I’m going to tell him

Joanna turns to Marni They stand nose to nose As
Joanna speaks she takes SEVERAL AGGRESSIVE STEPS
FORWARD forcing Marni into the STALL behind her

JOANNA
Id think carefully before I did
anything crazy Sis Who do you
honestly think Wade will believe

Backed into the empty stall Marni finds herself right
back where she was in high school Only this time she’s
not backing down so easily

MARNI
No You are not gonna do this to me
again I am not that same little four-
eyed acne covered girl I was in
school

JOANNA
(smirks)
Looked in a mirror lately
Off Marni livid

INT MARNI’S ROOM - DAY

Marni ENTERS to find a livid Wade sitting on her bed

MARNI
What are you doing

WADE
Waiting for you Joanna called and
told me everything I’m shocked

MARNI
I didn’t know how to tell you

WADE
Marni I can’t believe how mean you’ve
been to her

MARNI
Excuse me
WADE
And the day before her wedding That’s
messed up

Marni reels This can’t be happening

MARNI
Wade you’ve got it all wrong

WADE
You mean you didn’t pick a fight with
my fiancé in the bathroom at her own
bridal shower

MARNI
No I mean yes but she started it
WADE
She said you’d say that What were you
thinking
MARNTI

Wait She’s turning it all around

WADE
So you didn’t point the sprinklers
into your room yesterday and drench
her wedding dress

MARNT
It was one sprinkler But it was an
accident
Wade studies Marni
WADE

I think I know what this is about
You think I’1l bail on you once I
Marry Joanna

Marni can’t believe this is happening She’s about to
protest when

WADE (CONTD)
Stop worrying You’re not losing a
brother You’re gaining a sister
Someone I’m crazy for So please can
you put whatever issues you have with
Joanna behind you so we can try and
make this a nice wedding

Marni stands there speechless ready to scream But
instead she sucks it up quietly nodding “yes” Wade
gives her a hug

WADE (CONTD)
You’re the best I always know I can
count on you

Wade EXITS Marni catches her reflection in a nearby
mirror She scowls at herself totally frustrated

MATCH CUT TO

INT MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Gail scowling at her reflection in a mirror as she
examines her figure in a conservative body-swallowing
dress She puts her hands on either side of her face and
pulls doing that instant face lift thing all women do
She SIGHS

GAIL
Get it together babe You are not
gonna let some over-botoxed wannabe
prom queen get the best of you

Suddenly Stan appears in the mirror behind her

STAN

the rehearsal dinner tonight

There is a strange pause before she answers

GAIL
I don’t know I’m not sure I love it
I think I might go shopping

Stan registers there is something odd here

STAN
Everything okay

GAIL
Yeah I’m fine

STAN

I know you don’t think I pick up on
these kinds of things but I know you
better than you think I can tell when
something is bothering you

(off Gail listening)
Ramona’s pretty impressive huh All
those fancy sports cars big mansions
and private planes

(then)
Of course I like a car I fit my
family in and I bet a fourteen-room
mansion must feel really empty And
the private jet

GAIL
What about the private jet

STAN
Sorry Thatd be pretty cool

They share a laugh

GAIL
Did you know she runs a billion dollar
corporation I mean it’s amazing what
she’s accomplished

STAN

they are today

Gail smiles

worry about me I’ll be fine I think

getting to me I’m sure by Sunday

back in the mirror obviously still insecure

hands And you know what I’m glad

our game to a whole other level

(off Ben confused)
Wade may not believe his own sister
but he’1ll have a hard time not
believing his own eyes

(then)
Grab the shovel

Marni EXITS the car Ben grabs a shovel from the backseat
and follows her to the back of the school

inviting Tim

JOANNA

MARNI
It’s so hard coming to these things
alone

WADE

Marni you should have cleared this

MARNI
Joanna said she and Tim were never
serious I just figured you guys
wouldn’t mind

Joanna’s suspicious

MARNI (CONTD)
But I should’ve asked first I’m
sorry I’ll ask Tim to leave I don’t
have a problem being the only single
girl here I’m used to it

surprised as anyone to see her standing above them She
wears a loose fitting dress and addresses the crowd

like to celebrate the journey that got
them here I have taken the liberty of
exploring Wade and Joanna’s family
trees whose branches spread across
the globe So now please join me as we
celebrate the myriad of wedding
traditions of their ancestors who came
before them

ARABIC BELLY DANCE MUSIC reverberates through the hall as
Monique rips off her dress to reveal a BELLY DANCING
costume She BACKWARD-SOMMERSAULTS off of the table
landing off the floor like an Olympian

Monique works her way around the dining room UNDULATING
in time with the music as a roving spotlight follows her
around the room Everyone in the room is AGHAST Marni
looks to Gail

MARNI
Did you know about this

GAIL

She called me a couple of days ago
asking about our family’s heritage I
thought maybe she was incorporating it
into the menu

(then it hits her)
Oh no Great Aunt Elsie was born in
Africa

SMASH CUT TO

several of the country club’s DISHES on the floor

AT ONE OF THE TABLES Stan leans over to Gail

STAN
There goes our deposit

The music ABRUPTLY STOPS The LIGHTS COME BACK ON Like
four people CLAP But from the look on Monique’s face
youd think she just got a STANDING-O at Carnegie Hall

STAN gets up and TAPS his glass trying to get everyones
attention back on the party

STAN (CONTD)
Hello everyone I’m Stan Olsen
Wade’s father and Best Man Thank you
all for joining us And how about that
Monique Le Freak Am I right

ANGLE ON MONIQUE Taking another bow

STAN (CONTD)
I’m not going to lie I’ve practiced
this speech a hundred times in the
mirror And on the drive here But I
realized all that panic was a waste of
time All I have to do is stand up
here and speak from my heart

(then)

(MORE)

STAN (CONTD)
I love you son You’re everything one
should want to be Compassionate
Caring And most importantly honest
To see that you found someone with all
those same qualities makes me the
proudest man in this room

(then)

And Joanna while I’m technically the
Best Man tomorrow you should know
that the real best man will be
standing right next to you

Wade and Joanna watch from the head table touched But
it seems Stan’s words have sunk in with Joanna even more

STAN (CONTD)
(raises glass)
To Wade and Joanna

ANGLE ON WADE AND JOANNA Joanna takes a deep breath

JOANNA

I havent been completely honest with
you

Wade senses this is serious But before Joanna can

student after the next (Marni included) There’s no
denying it JJ WAS EVIL

so completely stuck in the past You
couldn’t let it go

MARNT
Hey all I wanted was an apology

JOANNA
You ruined everything Did you see the
look on Wades face I bet he’ll never
speak to me again

MARNTI
You actually expect me to feel sorry
for you That’s priceless
Marni turns and leaves

INT COUNTRY CLUB HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Marni huffs down the hallway Joanna right on her heels

JOANNA

MARNT
Do you have any idea what you did to
me How all those years of torment
affected me I couldn’t walk into a
public bathroom until two years ago I

OUT THE WINDOW GAIL CHASING RAMONA ACROSS THE BACK LAWN
Waving their arms wildly the women RUN OUT OF VIEW

BACK TO MARNI She grabs a VASE FULL OF FLOWERS

JOANNA
Marni NO

Joanna makes a move for Marni backing her up against
ANOTHER WINDOW Marni SWINGS THE FLOWERS back and forth
keeping Joanna at bay Again they both DON’T NOTICE

OUT THE WINDOW GAIL AND RAMONA ARE NOW ROLLING AROUND ON
THE BACK LAWN Yep It’s a FULL-ON “DYNASTY”-STYLE CAT
FIGHT As the women roll out of view

JOANNA (CONTD)
Please That vase is a wedding
present It cost a fortune

But Marni doesn’t care She throws the VASE at Joanna
dousing her in water and flowers The vase SHATTERS

MARNT
Whoopsy Slipped

JOANNA
Okay that’s it

Joanna grabs a SOUP TUREEN backing Marni into a CORNER

MARNTI

Why couldn’t you have just been nicer
to me My entire life could have been
so different

(then)
For years I wondered what I did to
deserve your abuse What could I have
done to avoid it I always wished I
was strong enough to stand up to you
But you know what I realized today I
didn’t need to stand up to you I only
needed to stand up for myself And you
know what Joanna I may not be saving
the world but I’m happy So I’m not
going to waste one more second
worrying about you or the crappy
things you did to me

(then)
JJ Freeman I AM DONE

JOANNA
I’m not

Joanna hurls the soup at Marnis head Marni is
completely showered in BROCCOLI SOUP

JOANNA (CONTD)
Now I’m done

WADE (0S)
What is going on here

Marni and Joanna turn to the doorway and find Wade

WADE (CONTD)
I came back to make sure you were
okay From the looks of it Id say
youre more than capable of taking
care of yourself
JOANNA
Wade it’s not what it looks like

The place is a war zone

WADE
Really ‘Cause it looks like you were
assaulting my sister with a soup
tureen But I guess it’s a step up
from a high school lunch tray

JOANNA
Please let me explain

WADE
I think I’ve heard enough for one
night I can’t believe I bought into
the whole Meals-on-Wheels Florence
Nightingale act I really thought I
knew who you were

JOANNA
Wade you do know who I am

WADE
Yeah Now I do “Warden” Youre a
bully You’re a liar You’re--

MARNI
An emotional terrorist

Wade cuts Marni down with a look stay out of this

JOANNA
Wade I never meant to hurt you You
have to believe that I was always so
happy that you fell in love with the
person I am that I was afraid that
you wouldn’t love me if you knew the
person I was

WADE
How do I know what to believe anymore
(re Marni)
From either for you You’re just as
much to blame Marni Going behind my
back Helping to orchestrate this
thing How could you do that

Marni hangs her head Joanna approaches Wade

JOANNA
I’m sorry Wade But it’s all behind
us now

WADE

Behind us I’m staring right at it

A relationship not to mention a
marriage is supposed to be built on
trust How can I ever trust you again

Wade EXITS

JOANNA
Wait Wade

But he’s gone Joanna runs from the restaurant in tears
Marni’s left alone She slumps into a chair Wondering
how things got so completely off track Stan and Ben
enter and see Marni COVERED IN GREEN SOUP

STAN
Lemme guess blindfold diet right
It’s a little tricky in the beginning
But youll get the hang of it

BEN
Where’s Mom

SMASH CUT TO
A CHANEL BAG

swinging wildly in the night like a BALL-AND-CHAIN WEAPON
from a kung fu movie WIDEN TO REVEAL we are

EXT COUNTRY CLUB - NIGHT

Gail and Ramona square off on the back lawn Ramona
wields her purse with expert precision as they circle
each other on the lawn Their matching dresses are
covered with grass stains This is our version of the
climactic battle in “Kill Bill” only with 50-year-olds
using handbags as weapons

RAMONA
Stay back I’m warning you I am not
afraid to use this

GAIL
Neither am I

Gail SWINGS her purse at Ramona Ramona SWINGS hers
defensively the two purses CLASHING like swords

GAIL (CONTD)
What is it Just tell me what I did to
make you treat me this way

RAMONA
I don’t know what you’re talking
about

GAIL

Oh come on You’ve been playing me
ever since you walked through my door
You big bully

Gail PUSHES her Ramona comes right back at her and soon
they’re locked in a DEATH HUG slapping at each other’s
backs Over the following they move closer and closer to
the COUNTRY CLUB SWIMMING POOL in the distance

GAIL (CONTD)

You know I was actually excited to
see you this weekend I didn’t care
what happened in high school I
thought finally closure with my good
old friend But nooooo You don’t want
closure You just want to re-open old
wounds and pour salt in them

(then)
Oh sorry You cut out salt You won’t
be happy until everybody is miserable

Gail PUSHES Ramona off of her not realizing they are at
the EDGE OF THE SWIMMING POOL Ramona teeters on the edge
in her heels She grabs Gail with one hand -- trying her
hardest not to fall in

Ramona’s almost regained her footing when SNAP Her
heel BREAKS OFF and SPLASH She falls backwards into
the POOL -- but she takes Gail right along with her

The women come up for air and start angrily splashing
water at each other

RAMONA
You wanna talk about miserable Fine
Rich Phillips You stole him away from
me Do you have any idea how that made
me feel

Gail is SHOCKED

GAIL
Richard Phillips That’s what this is
about But we only went to prom
together It was never serious

RAMONA
I was in love with him
(then)
Do you have any idea what it was like
to be runner-up to you again and again
and again

GAIL
(genuinely sorry)
Ramona I had no idea It was never a

competition
RAMONA
Of course it wasn’t You always won
(then)

But I swore to myself on prom night
that I would never let anyone make me
feel the way you did

(MORE )

RAMONA (CONTD)
I would never be vulnerable I would
always be strong And I guess it paid
off

GAIL
What are you talking about

RAMONA
Admit it It drives you crazy that
I’ve done so well for myself

Gail is speechless

RAMONA (CONTD)
That I look this good

GAIL
This is absurd

RAMONA
Come on You’re not even the slightest
bit jealous

GAIL
Ramona I’m happy for you and all that
youve achieved But I think we have
different definitions of success My
happiness isn’t determined by my age
or my looks or how much money I have
in the bank My children are my
greatest accomplishment
(then)
So no I’m sorry I’m not jealous of
you I have a family who loves me and
that is what makes me truly happy

After a long beat Ramona mutters

RAMONA
Well Happiness isn’t everything

GAIL
(rolls her eyes)
Oh forget it I give up

Gail walkswims towards the pool steps As a very
emotional Ramona screams after her she stops

RAMONA
I was so jealous You were smart You
were pretty Everyone wanted to be
your friend And then seeing you the
other night with your wonderful
husband and beautiful children
reminded me of how alone I am My
husband left me for somebody else I
don’t have anyone

(then)
(MORE )
RAMONA (CONTD)
I thought if I could just make
something of my life it would be
enough But look at me I have
everything money can buy and I’m
miserable You have nothing and you’re
happy I can’t win

GAIL
I’m so sorry I never meant to hurt
you I honestly didn’t know

RAMONA
I never told you And that’s my fault
(then)
But I guess I should probably thank

you If it weren’t for you I wouldn’t
have pushed myself so hard and I
wouldn’t be where I am today

They look at each other Drenched in their matching
dresses They burst into LAUGHTER

RAMONA (CONT’D)
This is so ridiculous What are we
doing

GAIL
I can’t believe I got a makeover
because of you

RAMONA
Well for what it’s worth I think you
look great just the way you are

GAIL
I think we both look pretty great

They smile and then hug Friends again at last

STAN (0S)
What the heck is going on out here

Stan Marni and Ben stand at the edge of the pool
confused OFF Gail and Ramona smiling awkwardly

INT OLSEN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

Stan sits at the dining room table He speaks to an
unseen person He is not happy

STAN
I am very disappointed with the
behavior I saw tonight Now I don’t
try to pretend I have the slightest
clue about how things work in the girl
world I’m just a dad I keep my head
down and I stay out of the way But
here’s what I do know A wedding is a
time for a family to come together

(MORE)

STAN (CONTD)
But for whatever reason this wedding
is tearing our family apart And I
for one have had it You are
completely out of control

REVERSE ANGLE ON GAIL AND MARNI Sitting at the opposite
end of the table still in their soup-stained pool-
drenched outfits looking like guilty teenagers

MARNTI GAIL
Joanna started it Ramona started it

INT OLSEN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - LATER

Gail and Marni now clean lay on the couch

GAIL
I can’t believe my husband actually
grounded me This blows

MARNI
I know I haven’t been grounded since
junior year At least this time he
didn’t take away the car

GAIL
Hey why didn’t you ever tell me about
what you went through in high school
I’m your Mom I could have helped

MARNT
I was embarrassed My whole life I’ve
wanted to be just like you I didn’t
want you to know I was a total loser
I guess some things never change huh

GAIL
Marni you are not a loser

MARNT
How is it high school only lasts 734
days but the emotional scars last for
the rest of your life

GAIL
You listen to me You are beautiful
and smart and successful Youve
already accomplished things in your
life that I never will You moved to a
new city You have an exciting career
So do yourself a favor Stop worrying
about wanting to be like me when you
grow up Because when I grow up I want
to be like you

MARNT
(eyes welling up)
Really

GAIL
Really

They HUG Marni GRINS from ear to ear

MARNI
What am I going to do about Wade Mom

Gail yawns totally wiped out

GAIL
Unfortunately I think we’re gonna
have to let Wade and Joanna work
through this one on their own

Marni contemplates
MARNI
No I started this I have to fix it
There’s gotta be way to get this
wedding back on track

She turns to Gail but she is ASLEEP Marni BOLTS from
the room

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Marni knocks on her bedroom door No answer She enters

MARNI
Joanna

The room is empty

INT OLSEN RESIDENCE - NIGHT

As Marni makes her way down the stairs she hears a weird
SUCKING SOUND coming from the KITCHEN Almost like one of
those spit-sucker things the dentist uses It grows
LOUDER as Marni enters the dark kitchen

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE ON MARNI Her eyes wide with fear

MARNI
Oh no

WIDEN TO REVEAL Joanna on the floor in front of the open
refrigerator surrounded by JUNK FOOD She holds a can of
CHOCOLATE REDDI WHIP in her hand Her wedding dress is
sprawled around her

MARNI (CONTD)
Joanna no Put the whip cream down
It’s full of carbs It’s not worth it

Joanna looks up at her in a daze She looks like hell
Her dress is covered with CHEETOS and are those OREOS

JOANNA
What difference does it make IT’S NOT
LIKE I’M GETTING MARRIED ANYMORE
(then)
I’m an awful person

MARNT
No I’m the awful person I ruined
your rehearsal dinner I ruined your
wedding I’m so ashamed I really hope
you can forgive me

JOANNA
Marni Stop apologizing I deserved
it I deserve all of it

Marni doesn’t say anything She sits down beside her
careful not to sit on the jar of PEANUT BUTTER

JOANNA (CONTD)
Ive spent so many years trying to
distance myself from the person I was
back then I changed my attitude I
changed my name But it wasn’t enough
obviously Because if I had really
changed then I would have been strong
enough to apologize to you the moment
you walked in the door

Joanna takes a HUGE shot of CHOCOLATE REDDI WHIP into her
mouth Some of it DRIPS down her chin threatening to
drop onto her white dress Marni watches nervously

JOANNA (CONTD)
You were the only person who wouldn’t
let me forget Seeing you made me feel
18 again I guess I panicked I just
didn’t want Wade to know how awful I
was back then But you have to believe
me It was never personal

MARNT
It felt pretty personal to me

The whip cream finally DROPS Marni grabs it with a
napkin just in time She saves the dress Sort of

JOANNA
Look I don’t expect you to ever
forgive me but I do want you to know
that I’m truly sorry

At long last There it is Her apology
MARNI
Excuse me Could you say that one more
time A little slower

Joanna knows Marni is relishing this but is ready to
take her long overdue medicine

JOANNA
I’m sorry Marni About everything

MARNT
Thanks Joanna I appreciate that

They smile But Joanna’s smile quickly turns to anguished
sobs She shovels more Cheetos into her mouth

JOANNA
I’ve made such a mess of things Wade
won’t speak to me I can’t live

without him What am I going to do
OFF Marni determined

EXT PARK TRAIL — MORNING

Wade jogs Out of nowhere comes Marni running behind
him Her leg cramps She FIGHTS on refusing to give up

MARNI

Whaa Wa De Wa Waaaddde
WADE

Go away
MARNI

I will run until I die

Wade can tell she’s not kidding

EXT PARK OVERLOOK - DAY

Wade and Marni sit on a bench overlooking the city Wade
is not happy

WADE
Are you kidding me Bringing that Tim
guy was bad enough But that video
How could you do that

MARNT
I’m sorry I just wanted you to know
the truth before you married Joanna

WADE
Well you don’t have to worry I’m not
marrying Joanna anymore

MARNT
Twenty-four hours ago I would’ve been
happy to hear you say that But I
realized today she’s not the same
person she was in high school She
loves you dummy And judging from the
goofy borderline embarrassing way you
act around her you love her too
Nothing she did back then should
change that

(MORE )

MARNI (CONTD)
(then)
I gave her a second chance Maybe you
should too I mean at least one of us
should get a happy ending here

After a beat Wade softens with a smile

INT BEN’S BEDROOM - DAY

Marni and Ben regroup in Ben’s room

MARNT
So I guess now we just have to wait
and see what happens I told Wade the
truth and

Ben looks out the window His EYES BUG OUT

BEN
Noooo

MARNI
What

BEN

It’s Wade and Joanna They’re in the
tree house making out

He points out the window

MARNI
That’s great

BEN

No You told me he was giving her the
treehouse It’s my tree house I
didn’t want her to have it so I was
gonna take it down I loosened the
bolts but didn’t get a chance to
finish

Ben and Marni SPRINT out of the room

EXT OLSEN BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Marni and Ben race outside yelling up to the TREEHOUSE
MARNT
Hey guys Um can we talk to you
Down here Like now

Wade sticks his head out of the treehouse

WADE
Can it wait We’re kinda busy

MARNI
But it’s really important

WADE
This is pretty important too We’1l be
down in a minute

BEN
You’1l be down sooner than you think

Suddenly we hear a CRACKLING NOISE The support beams of
the treehouse start to BUCKLE Marni and Ben cover their
eyes They can’t watch The treehouse CRASHES DOWN to the
ground in a powerful THUD

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Wade and Joanna lie in SEPARATE BEDS Wade has a BROKEN
ARM and some cuts and bruises Joanna has a BROKEN LEG
and wears CAST UP TO HER WAIST Marni Ben Gail and
Ramona all tend to them

MARNTI
I am so sorry you two

WADE
What are you sorry for Mom said it
was most likely termites They’ve been
meaning to get that tree looked at
It was bad timing that’s all

BEN
Termites are the silent killer

He shares a knowing look with Marni STAN ENTERS in
SCRUBS He reads a medical chart

RAMONA
How bad is it Stan

STAN
You two escaped the worst of it
Other than the broken bones the x-
rays look fine

GAIL
Oh thank goodness

JOANNA
What about the wedding

STAN
I’m sorry kids I think we’re going
to have to put the wedding on hold
Nobody is leaving this hospital today

Saddened Wade and Joanna hold hands from across the bed
Marni watches the affectionate couple Surprisingly
she’s not grossed out Instead she’s energized

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - A SECOND LATER

Marni dials her cell phone

MARNTI
Monique Hi It’s Marni About the

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Joanna sleeps She’s nudged awake

JOANNA
What’s going on

Joanna looks up to find Marni Kendall and Taylor

OFF Joanna confused

EXT HOSPITAL ROOF - NIGHT

The ELEVATOR doors open to reveal Joanna and her

Bridesmaids Joanna wears her Cheeto stained WEDDING GOWN
which has been awkwardly pinned around her BODY CAST She
HOBBLES out of the elevator on crutches in awe over what
Marni has done

The roof of the hospital has been transformed into a
magical setting WHITE TWINKLE LIGHTS line the exterior
FLOWERS and BALLOONS that read “It’s A Boy and “Get
Well Soon are everywhere

The CHAPEL ALTAR has been brought up and placed near the
edge of the roof overlooking the entire city CHAIRS
have been transferred to the roof for family friends
nurses surgeons and guests Guests settle in

JOANNA
You did all this

MARNTI
I know it’s not the fairy tale wedding
youd planned but hopefully --

Joanna sees Wade standing at the alter She MELTS

JOANNA
It’s perfect

TAYLOR
Joanna did you know Marni talked to
Justin Timberlake once Why didn’t
you tell us she had such a cool job

JOANNA
She is pretty cool

The girls make their way down the aisle Joanna
accidentally TRIPS an elderly gentleman with her
crutches She then TAKES OUT a tall floral arrangement
but she has no idea She is focused only Wade --
intoxicated by love

EXT HOSPITAL ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

Joanna and Wade stand at alter flanked by their bridal
party Joanna notices Ben standing at the end of a line
of tall groomsmen struggling to see the ceremony

JOANNA
Hey Ben

She motions Ben to the front of the line Ben SMILES and
quickly takes his place STANDING BETWEEN Wade and Joanna
atthe alter Wade and Joanna share a look

BEN
Relax people I’m kidding

Ben winks at Wade as he moves to his other side Everyone
settles waiting for the wedding to begin Suddenly

-MONIQUE LE FRIQUE marches down the aisle dressed in
her interpretation of a Catholic Priest’s garb

MONIQUE
Bonjour-Hello everyone

Monique takes her place at the alter

MONIQUE (CONTD)

At long last we are gathered here
today to join Wade Olsen and Joanna
Goldman in holy matrimony As I’ve
said before every wedding tells a
story Yes it is true that my version
of this story was a wedding in three
acts that culminated in a castle by
the ocean not on the set of “General
Hospital”

(then)
But during my time as your Wedding
Extraordinator I have learned that it
is not as important that your wedding
is perfect for you as it is that you
are perfect for each other So now
without further ado

(then)
If there is anyone who finds just
cause that these two should not be
lawfully joined speak now or forever
hold your peace

Suddenly EVERYONE turns to look at Marni

MARNI
What

EXT HOSPITAL ROOFTOP - LATER

A festive reception is underway Music BLASTS from a BOOM
BOX Guests dance on the makeshift dance floor

Wade and Joanna DANCE AWKWARDLY navigating through casts
and crutches determined to enjoy their first few moments
of marital bliss

We FIND Ramona at the bar Suddenly Gail appears behind
her with an attractive man She taps her on the shoulder

GAIL
Ramona there’s someone here who would
like to see you

Ramona turns to see the man with Gail Her JAW DROPS
It’s her old crush from High School

RAMONA
Rich Phillips

GAIL
Rich works at the hospital with Stan

RICH
You look great Ramona You haven’t
changed a bit since high school

RAMONA
(smiling at Gail)
Well hopefully I’ve changed a little

GAIL
I’1l let you two catch up

Gail exits thrilled to finally have closure with Ramona
Suddenly we hear Marni’s voice thru the SPEAKERS

MARNI
Um excuse me can I please have
everyone’s attention

Everyone turns to find Marni standing in front of a make-
shift stage

MARNI (CONTD)
Hi I’m Marni Sister of the groom I
struggled to come up with the perfect
wedding gift for Wade and Joanna I
wanted it to be something special
something to commemorate their happy
ending And then it hit me-- what
better way than to go back to their
beginning So here to sing a song I
think we can all appreciate

Marni pulls back a make-shift curtain to reveal THE
CAPTAIN and TENNILLE

They begin to play and as the sounds of “Love Will Keep
Us Together” fill the rooftop Wade and Joanna join their
guests on dance floor -- everyone singing and dancing and
having a great time

ANGLE ON MARNI Off to the side scanning the party She
watches Gail still battered from the cat fight DANCE
AWKWARDLY with Stan Suddenly Marni notices

-Charlie Staring at her from across the party He
smiles and waves She blushes looking behind her Is he
actually waving to her When she turns back around
Charlie is standing right in front of her

CHARLIE
You’re a hard one to track down I
tried to talk to you at the rehearsal
last night

MARNT
Sorry I kinda had my hands full
How’s your lip

CHARLIE
I think I’1l live

Determined to not be the dork again Marni summons all of
her courage

MARNI
So you wanna dance

CHARLIE
(playful)
I don’t know You’ve got some pretty
lethal moves

MARNT
C’mon everyone deserves a second
chance

Charlie smiles and follows Marni onto the dance floor
One step closer to their own happy ending

We PAN around the rooftop as everyone busts out their
signature moves from the dance off

THE CAMERA FINDS Gail Ramona Marni and Joanna who have
all found their way to the CENTER OF THE DANCE FLOOR The
four women dance in a circle All of them happy All of
them relaxed And all of them just little bit better for
having gone through this weekend Together

FADE OUT
