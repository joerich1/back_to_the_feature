OVER BLACK A TITLE CARD

CHAPTER ONE

In His Own Image

A PAIR OF EYES

Intense Focused Filled with trepidation But underneath
this fear a hint of resolve Whatever these eyes are staring
at its a seminal moment one that HAS to be done The

only sound - WIND Just WIND SWIRLING all around us

WIDEN to find these eyes belong to ETHAN CAMBELL (mid-30s)
a kind face a little innocent Hes dressed in a MALE
NURSES UNIFORM A CHIRON says “MIDTOWN MANHATTAN NEW
YORK

The SOUND of DISTANT CITY TRAFFIC begins to SEEP in LOUDER
now as we ARM DOWN his body to REVEAL him STANDING ON THE
VERY EDGE of a SEVEN TOR) YSCRAPER the toes of his
Converse hanging two inches over the ledge Teetering
dizzily

Were getting VERTIGO just looking at it Holy shit this
guy is ABOUT TO JUMP And you know what he does -- He
stretches his arms out in a SWAN DIVE position and LEANS
FORWARD and FALLS

We watch in a SUBJECTIVE SHOT as he LEAVES THE LEDGE and
PLUMMETS down the side of the building at 127 MPH The street
below races towards us faster and faster until WHOOSH
He STOPS In MID-AIR (Still SUBJECTIVE CAMERA) Hovers for

a beat then just as quickly BANKS LEFT and TAKES OFF And
now hes actually fucking FLYING

Thirty floors ABOVE THE STREET and SOARING in the most
beautiful and exhilarating (SUBJECTIVE CAMERA) FLYING sequence
youve ever seen

SAILING THROUGH THE CANYONS OF MANHATTAN

SWOOPING and DIVING ROLLING and TUMBLING at a hundred and
fifty MPH ROLLING BANKING TUMBLING he SOARS DOWN to a
busy street and comes to a FLOATING STOP HOVERING fifty

feet above the crowded sidewalk ROCKING SLOWLY RHYTHMICALLY
in MID AIR

No one seems to notice except ONE LONE MAN his head craned
back staring up at us (We will soon come to know this man
as HARRISON CAMBELL Ethans brother) As he stares up at
him curiously --

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205 2

CABBIE (0S)
(Arabic accent)
Your stop sir

SMASH CUT TO
INT TAXI - MORNING 1
Ethan WAKES with a start to find himself in the back seat
He takes a moment to get his bearings obviously rattled by

the odd dream The Middle Eastern CABBIE stares through the
partition at him

CABBIE
You get out here yes

ETHAN
Oh Yeah Sorry I havent been
sleeping much lately and Sorry

He pulls a couple BILLS out of his wallet and hands them to
the Cabbie Climbs out

EXT CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS 2

Ethan still reeling from the dream stands on this busy
sidewalk orienting himself He looks up at a stately old
apartment building then down at a BUS ROARING past Someone
has plastered a CAMPAIGN POSTER on the side -- The smiling
face of HARRISON CAMBELL (The guy Ethan just saw in the
flying dream) Underneath it reads “Harrison Cambell -- State
Senate -- For A New Tomorrow

Ethan stares for a beat then starts towards the entrance of
the apartment building He STOPS Looks down at a COCKROACH
crossing his path Fascinated by it he watches as it CRAWLS
to the gutter and into DRAINAGE GRATE and --

SURESH (V0)
Man is a narcissistic species by nature

cuT TO
INT LECTURE HALL - DAY 3
THAT SAME COCKROACH

Or at least one that LOOKS LIKE IT crawls out of a crack in
the wall and scurries along the floor

A HAND

reaches INTO FRAME and PICKS IT UP WIDEN to meet Professor
MOHINDER SURESH (mid-30s) a slightly nerdy East Indian
academician standing in at the front of this LECTURE HALL
in an old faded British colonial building

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

A CHIRON tells us this is THE UNIVERSITY OF MADRAS INDIA

SURESH
But we are not the pinnacle of so-called
evolution

Behind him hes written his lecture in HINDI on the
blackboard (All but one word in English “ TERAFORMA” )

He lets the COCKROACH crawl along the back of his hand as he
speaks to a pathetically small group of FIVE STUDENTS
scattered among the empty seats in this large classroom

SURESH (CONTD)
That honor belongs to the lowly
cockroach A creature who has adapted
and evolved for 250 million years
Capable of living for months without
food Remaining alive headless for
weeks at a time

As Suresh speaks he looks up to see --

THE DEAN

An elderly Brahmin standing at the back of the class Suresh
is little flustered by his presence He continues --

SURESH (CONTD)
Its female need only be impregnated
once to lay over a million eggs in her
lifetime Resistant to radiation it
is the only species who will survive a
nuclear winter If God has indeed
created himself in his own image then
I submit to you that God is a cockroach

The class stares at him unsure what to make of this strange
pronouncement The Dean nods unamused He CLAPS his hands
LOUD twice to get everyones attention

DEAN
you are all dismissed This class has
been canceled

The five students stand a little confused and shuffle out
as the Dean approaches Professor Suresh (Their conversation
is in HINDI with English subtitles)

SURESH
Sir I know the enrollment is down a
little this semester but --

DEAN
Im afraid this institution can no longer
support your tenure Dr Suresh

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

SURESH
What are you saying

EAN
You are being dismissed from the faculty

SURESH
What

DEAN
your theories are unfounded

SURESH
a body blow)
But-this is my lifes work

DEAN
fhe truth is no one pelieves in your
work and no one wants to publish your

theories

SURESH
BUT ITS HAPPENING now The world needs
to know

EAN

Im sorry Our decision is final
and off Sureshs stunned look -
INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE SURESHS APARTMENT - DAY

professor Suresh comes up the staircase of this four story
walk-up carrying his briefcase and a net bag full of
groceries He moves to his door fumbles for his key then
STOPS Something is wrong very wrong Its the door
Its OPEN a tiny crack

suresh goes into FULL PANIC MODE This is something he has
dreaded but hasnt fully prepared for “Think think

He gathers his courage and GENTLY PUSHES the door open far

enough to see inside --

SURESHS POV --

The place is TORN APART His gaze MOVES to a HUGE MAP OF
THE WORLD taking up an entire wall The map has dozens of
COLORED PUSH PINS placed into different locations around the
world A SHADOW washes over it Shit someones in there

suresh pulls pack leans against the wall Breathes Forces
himself to think Then steeling himself he pushes open
the door and slinks into --
HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205 5

INT SURESHS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 5

A dark cluttered two room apartment Stacks of BOOKS and
RESEARCH The home of an obsessive single-minded academic

Suresh slinks to a desk quietly tries to open a drawer
Shit its STUCK He PULLS hard and the desk shakes as the
drawer POPS OPEN Something falls off the desk and lands at
his feet A pair of HORNED RIMMED GLASSES He picks them
up Looks at them curiously These are clearly NOT HIS
OS we HEAR someone RANSACKING the adjacent room

He sets the glasses back down and reaches into the drawer
Pulls out a small CAMERA Aims it at the map on the wall
SNAPS a photo The FLASH GOES OFF Shit He cringes as
the 08 RANSACKING suddenly STOPS Theyve noticed

Suresh RUSHES up to the map reaches up and pulls out a WHITE
PUSH PIN thats right over MANHATTAN turns and SPRINTS out
of the apartment

And one second later the FIGURE of a MAN STEPS INTO the
FOREGROUND Stands here taking in the room his BACK TO
US Cold calculating We DO NOT see the mans face but
he reaches down and picks up the HORN RIMMED GLASSES slips
them on

Steps up to the map on the wall Studies it sensing that
something’s different We PUSH RIGHT PAST him and onto a

PUSH PIN inserted into the map right over the central part
of NEVADA -

As we PUSH IN farther Nevada MORPHS to the WHITE SAND of a
SATELLITE IMAGE over the entire state We SLAM IN RACING

DOWN as DETAIL begins to emerge - The city of LAS VEGAS -

past the strip and INTO THE SUBURBS - Where we finally come
to a STOP over a the rooftop of a small TRACT HOUSE and --

BLEED TO WHITE
INT NIKI SANDERS GARAGE - MORNING 6
FADE IN ON A PAIR OF LACY PANTIES

as they slide slowly sexily off a womans shapely REAR END
WIDEN to find NIKI SANDERS showgirl looks completely
NAKED (strategically posed) holding the panties teasingly
in front of her She COOS and makes a pouty sexy face

The CHIRON says LAS VEGAS NEVADA

We PULL FURTHER back to see her posed on a BED with a blue
satin bedspread Shiny gold curtains hang behind the bed
FURTHER BACK now and we realize that we are in a GARAGE
This is a SET Niki is performing for a WEBCAM on a tripod
A cable stretches from the camera to a COMPUTER on a DESK
REROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

Niki slips on a tiny silk robe and crosses to the computer
Types quickly

ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

we see the words Times up The CURSOR BLINKS as it waits
for a response A beat then we see the response “Just a
little more Please Im almost there

Nikis answers this by typing -- Itll cost you another 39
bucks

Niki waits for the response The BLINKING CURSOR then --
BITCH

NIKI
(under her breath)
Creep

She turns and heads for the door but stops An odd look on
her face A little scared She whips around as though
expecting someone to be there She stares across the room
at a MIRROR Her own REFLECTION stares back Something
about it disturbs her

She backs slowly to the door that leads into --
7 INT NIKI SANDERS HOUSE - MORNING

A tiny cracker box of a house Niki makes her way down the
narrow hallway stepping over a baseball glove

NIKI
Time to wake up Micah

She comes to a stop at a bedroom doorway Looks into --
MICAHS BEDROOM

The domain of a messy ten year old boy The bed is unmade
but Micah is nowhere to be seen (NOTE We see Nikis
REFLECTION in a MIRROR on the back of the door Her profile)

Niki stares at the empty bed Then suddenly a little
panicked as a terrible thought dawns on her --

NIKI (CONTD)
Micah

She turns and hurries down the hall But as she does her
REFLECTION in the mirror takes a SPLIT SECOND LONGER to move
than she did This is barely perceptible and a little weird

IN LIVING ROOM

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

Niki stops looks Tacky furnishings no frills These are
people living at the bottom of the American dream

NIKI (CONTD)
Micah

She heads into --
THE KITCHEN

where we see MICAH of mixed race half black sitting
at the small table eating a bowl of FRUIT LOOPS as he
examines a SHOE BOX next to him He looks up innocently

MICAH

into the lid with a pen

NIKI (CONTD)

casino You made a lot of money there

NIKI
Because I cant alright and youre

Before she can respond the DOORBELL RINGS Niki stops A
panicked look crosses her face

NIKI
(ominous )
Grab your stuff and wait by the back
door

MICAH

NIKI
Just do it

Niki turns and heads into -

THE LIVING ROOM

where she crosses to the window and pulls back the curtains
HER POV - THROUGH THE WINDOW

Two MEN stand at her front door One is a little WEASEL of
a GUY ina tight LEATHER JACKET The other is BIG And I

Trust me its not that cold outside

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205 9

Niki shuts the curtain Eyes wide The DOORBELL RINGS again

AT THE BACK DOOR

Niki now in a bra and shimmying into a pair of jeans
wrestles a t-shirt over her head as she meets up with Micah
He waits with his backpack And now hes scared

MICAH

NIKI
Nevermind just keep your voice down
and stay close to me

They head out the door
SMASH CUT TO

A FENCE as Niki and Micah drop over it and SCURRY QUICKLY
to an old DATSON B210 parked at the curb

Micah JUMPS into the passenger side Niki unhooks the WIRE

In a billow of EXHAUST SMOKE the car lurches then FISHTAILS
down the street We RISE UP as it disappears around the
corner and --

SMASH CUT TO

FADE OUT
INT BEDROOM - PENTHOUSE APARTMENT DAY 10

And FADE IN on ETHAN (our guy with the flying dream) leaning
against the headboard of a big bed reading aloud from the
New York Times stock page A HEADLINE on the folded page
facing us reads Skies Clear for Solar Eclipse

On the bed next to Ethan an OLD MAN thin frail
lies dying a breathing tube in his nose Ethan is a hospice
nurse hence the uniform A warm and gentle soul selfless
almost a saint

Were on the 3lst floor of the stately old apartment that we
saw earlier A CHIRON Says UPPER EAST SIDE MANHATTAN

Ethan smiles a little embarrassed --

And now its Stella who looks at him embarrassed He was
serious and they both realize it Hes got a crush on her
And why not So do we

ETHAN (CONTD)

As he walks off Stella sits next to her father Ethan walks
towards the WINDOW that he flew out of in his dream Its
CLOSED CURTAINS DRAWN As he stops and stares at it the
sight of it upsetting him --

EXT CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS -— DAY
CLOSE ON THE SMILING FACE OF HARRISON CAMBELL

WIDEN to find this image is one of several CAMPAIGN POSTERS

Ethan heads towards the entrance but stops as a WAVE OF
PEOPLE head out making their way towards two BLACK
EXPEDITIONS parked at the curb

HARRISON CAMBELL Ethans fraternal twin brother
dressed in an Armani suit turns and sees Ethan Where Ethan
is a lost dreamer Harrison is a golden boy A star A

look of trepidation crosses his face and he hurries over to

When I got out of bed this morning my
foot hovered before it hit the floor

Harrison grabs him and pulls him against the wall

HARRISON

INT LOFT - DAY

A BUCKET of PAINT is tossed onto a PAINTING destroying what
is a brilliant PHOTO-REALIST image of a PLANE CRASHING into
a BRIDGE

PULL BACK to meet ISAAC BOROLO a wiry handsome but
strung-out junkie Black jeans a Being John Malkovitch t-
shirt barefoot with a five-day growth on his face

Were not sure whats going on with him but hes frantic
about something and having a REALLY BAD DAY

were in a huge ARTISTS LOFT with tin foil covering the
large windows Only tiny CRACKS of SUNLIGHT seep through
The CHIRON reads LOWER EAST SIDE MANHATTAN Isaac pulls
another painting from a stack against the wall Another
photo-realist image - this one of a BUILDING BURNING

Isaac grabs the bucket of paint and rears back to toss it--

STELLA (0S)
What the hell are you doing

He stops and turns to see STELLA (the old dying mans
daughter) standing in the doorway sunlight silhouetting
her one hand leaning on the doorjamb

He fills the bucket up with more paint She approaches
Pissed confused --

STELLA (CONTD)
Are you high

ISAAC
No Yes I dont know

He tosses paint on ANOTHER PAINTING This one has the image
of a TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN

STELLA

Would you stop What are you crazy
ISAAC

Clearly
STELLA

Youre chasing arent you

He looks at her Whatever that means hes verified it with
his silence She moves to the destroyed paintings Looks
at them like theyre dead kittens

STELLA (CONTD)
When did you do these

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205 16

He doesnt answer

STELLA (CONTD)
These are fantastic Theres enough

ISAAC

ISAAC

Because I dont even remember doing

He angrily crosses the paintings Lifts one from the stack
Its big five feet wide A photo-realism image of THREE
RACE HORSES crossing a finish line

ISAAC
This horse Name is Applejax This is
him winning the Santa Anita Derby in
the sixth race I painted it three
weeks ago

Stella stares at it confused

STELLA

Isaac strides over to a table Picks up a NEWSPAPER Flips
through it Shoves a page right into her face Stella
stares confused And now WE SEE the page Its a PHOTOGRAPH
in the Sports Section Its the IDENTICAL IMAGE

ISAAC

STELLA
But thats
HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

ISAAC
Impossible Apparently not

STELLA
You telling me you can paint the future

Isaac doesn’t answer Just fills the bucket again

STELLA (CONTD)
Its just a coincidence You were high
For all you know you couldve painted

Isaac angrily pulls out another PAINTING from the stack

ISAAC
No This one I painted this morning

He spins it around for us to see The image is of Stella

STANDING IN THE DOORWAY wearing the same flowery dress The
EXACT IMAGE we first saw of her -- Sunlight silhouetting her
from behind one hand leaning on the doorjamb above her head

She stares at it now a little freaked

ISAAC (CONTD)
Somethings Wrong With me

STELLA
(desperate)

one way left
STELLA

You cant do that Not alone I can
help you I love you Please

ISAAC
NO Ill drag you down with me I swear
to God I will Just leave me alone
(off her stare)
Get out of here NOW

Stella holds his gaze What she gets for falling in love
with a junkie She nods and slowly backs away turns and
walks out Isaac watches her Then stares at the paintings
A moment of decision Hes got a plan and hes sticking to
it He crosses quickly to a desk

YANKS open a drawer and pulls out a ROLLED UP t-shirt
Unrolls it onto the desk

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

Inside is FIX KIT - a SYRINGE a SPOON a BURNER a BAG OF
HEROIN Another drawer YANKS open and he reaches in pulls
out a pair of HANDCUFFS Strides to the middle of the room
Lays the fix kit down on the floor opens it

He walks back to the wall sits crosses his legs Takes
ONE END of the handcuffs and SNAPS them onto his WRIST
Takes THE OTHER END and SNAPS it onto the RADIATOR

He stares at the heroin ten feet away So close but now
impossible to get to Off his steely determination --

EXT ROCK QUARRY - DAY

Were looking at a SHAKY HOME VIDEO IMAGE of CLAIRE BENNET standing on the edge of a TWO HUNDRED FOOT CLIFF at a
rock quarry staring over the precipice Claire has girl-
next-door looks and to complete the cliché shes dressed
in a CHEERLEADING OUTFIT A CHIRON prints out across the
screen -- ODESSA TEXAS

Claires life up until now has been as ordinary as any kid

in rural America But right now its anything but ordinary
Because at this moment her arms outstretch and she leans
forward and steps off the ledge Like shes flying
Except shes NOT flying Shes FALLING And fast We watch
this horrible incident like a bad “shock video” TV moment
Until SPLAT She hits the ground FULL FORCE Its fucking
awful

The CAMERA runs up to her like assassination footage We
hear the LABORED BREATHING of whoever is shooting this video
footage The CAMERA stops and aims down at her BROKEN
TWISTED body BLOOD on the rocks

A long beat then Claire begins to STIR Slowly She POPS

her dislocated leg BACK INTO ITS SOCKET Her joints SQUISH

and SNAP into place ‘Then she pries her bloody face off the
rock and looks right INTO CAMERA --

CLAIRE
This is Claire Bennet and that was
attempt number six
And off her placid expression --

CLOSE ON A CLOCK FACE

that reads 147 The SWEEP HAND TICKS off the seconds
rhythmically Tick tick tick

BDJUST to see HIRO TANAKA staring at the clock
intensely Hes two feet away from it his stare practically
boring a hole into it His face is actually shaking hes
concentrating so hard on it

WIDEN to find Hiro at his cluttered desk in a tiny OFFICE
CUBICLE the walls covered with JAPANESE ANIME CHARACTERS
pinned to every surface The CHIRON says TOKYO JAPAN

Hiro is slight and nondescript in his short white sleeve
shirt and black tie A worker bee in sea of worker bees
However Hiro has a hint of the nonconformist in him A
little spike to his hairstyle His tie a little too thin
A small punk bracelet tucking out of his sleeve

We HOLD on him as his fervent stare intensifies on the clock -
eyes bulging forehead sweating And then miraculously --

THE SWEEP HAND

STOPS QUIVERS and CLICKS ONE SECOND BACK - before resuming
its normal forward rhythm

Hiro THRUSTS both fists into the air

HIRO
BONSAI

He leaps out of his chair and lunges out of the cubicle We
TRACK WITH him as he SPRINTS down the long aisle past what
seems like a hundred other cubicles in this bee hive of
workers

IN ANOTHER CUBICLE

CLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

A live VIDEO IMAGE of Niki (our webcam stripper) slipping
into her tiny robe Shes on the SET in her garage
HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205 20

(This is the VERY SAME scene we saw earlier)

Niki walks past the camera leaving just the image of the
empty bed Under which we see the words Times up type
out across the COMPUTER SCREEN

WIDEN to meet ANDO MASAHASHI a little more conservative
looking than Hiro and frankly a bit of a killjoy Where
Hiros cubicle was a cluttered mess Andos is exemplary in
its neatness

Ando types his response to Niki Just a little more
Please Im almost there The CURSOR BLINKS then Nikis
response Itll cost you another 39 bucks

Ando stares at the BLINKING CURSOR then types BITCH

Just then Hiro SLIDES around a corner and into the cubicle
Ando quickly hits a button on he keyboard - A SCREEN SAVER
for Star Wars - Revenge Of The Sith takes over the screen

Hiro catches his breath for a beat before -- (Their
conversation is in Japanese - subtitled to English)

HIRO (CONTD)
I did it I did it

ANDO
(impatient )

What now
HIRO

Ive broken the spacetime continuum

ANDO
(thoroughly uninterested)
Good for you

HIRO
My clock I made it go back one second
using only my mind my thoughts

ANDO
Too bad youre not paid by the hour
Youd be onto something

HIRO
Im serious This explains the subway
this morning

ANDO
It was fourteen seconds late Big deal

HIRO
(for the 10th time)
That train is never late

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

ANDO
(humoring him)
Until you made it late using only
your mind

HIRO
yes I have discovered powers beyond
any mere mortal

ANDO
Right You and Spock

HIRO
(finally you get it)
Yes Like Spock Exactly

Suddenly Hiro is grabbed by the scruff of his shirt Its
his BOSS who starts YELLING at him as he drags him away

She pulls Micah towards the door but passes a MIRROR along
the way She catches her REFLECTION in it Stops Looks
at herself Something about it pisses her off

She strides up to the mirror stares Then rears her hand
back And just as shes about to strike her palm into the
glass - her REFLECTION SLIDES UP and OUT of the frame

WHAM She SHATTERS the empty mirror with her palm Then
follows the trajectory of WHERE THE REFLECTION WENT She
stares up at the corner of the ceiling at something we CANNOT
see A long and strange beat as everyone stares at her

Claire has her chin on her knees staring out at nothing
Shes completely cleaned up from her fall looks normal

CLAIRE
I am so depressed

ZOE

Claire turns and gives her one of those teenager looks

ZOE (CONTD)
Besides the fact that it was so gross I

CLAIRE
Not if nobody finds out it isnt

ZOE
Then whyd you want me to tape it

CLAIRE
I have my reasons

ZOE

bloody horrific COMPOUND FRACTURE POKING through her SHIN
Its almost too gross and bloody to look at

CLAIRE
(only slightly annoyed)

Claire reaches down and POPS the bone back into her flesh
It makes a SICKENING SOUND as it SNAPS into place She looks
back up at Zoe --

CLAIRE (CONTD)

She holds out her hand impatiently snaps her fingers Zoe
relents Opens the camera pulls out the tiny digital
CASSETTE and hands it to her

Claire stands and starts to walk off limping slightly Zoe
watches her

down system State of the art four

up tighter than a cats butt last night

Doug and I saw this Mexican guy a
homeless dude on our way to school
We thought he was dead But he wasnt

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205 44

Kent just nods Not exactly what he was hoping for but
He and Sandra turn to Claire expectantly Without hesitation --

CLAIRE
I jumped off a cliff and I didnt
die

Dead silence as everyone looks at her trying to figure out
what that could possibly mean Kent doing his best to relate --

KENT
I know youre at that secretive age
sweetheart but what do you mean by
that

Claire on the spot hesitates

SANDRA
I know what she means

Claire looks at her a mixture of fear and relief

SANDRA (CONTD)
Here I am talking about getting passed
over for a silly little raise and you
go and say something really profound
We come to all kinds of cliffs in our
lives And when we face our fears and
jump we usually dont get hurt
(welling up)

Youre very wise sweetheart Whatever
it is you did Im proud of you

Off Claires tiny forced smile -
INT TAXI - LATE AFTERNOON 41

Ethan climbs into back seat of the cab stares out the window
up at the sky The LIGHT has darkened from ECLIPSE and we
realize we are RIGHT where and when we last left him

ETHAN
(to 0S driver)
The corner of Center and Canal please

The taxi pulls away and Ethan stares out the window up to
the sky

CLOSE ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR

as a HAND reaches up to adjust it In its REFLECTION we see
Ethan from the drivers perspective A voyeuristic moment
as Ethan has no idea hes being spied upon

SURESH (0S)
A Solar Eclipse

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

Ethan looks up at the driver Its PROFESSOR SURESH looking
as anonymous as any other Third World cabbie in Manhattan

ETHAN
Oh Yeah Wonder if its gonna be
total

SURESH
Not here no Some other part of the
world yes A true global event Makes
one appreciate how small our planet
really is

Ethan looks at Suresh intrigued by his observation

SURESH (CONTD)
But then we are all rather small arent
we

Ethan nods as he stares at Suresh Its an odd stare an
instant and overwhelming need to open up this conversation
A perfect stranger no strings Whats the harm

ETHAN
Whats your name

SURESH
Mohinder

ETHAN
Im Ethan
(beat)
Let me ask you something Mohinder
You ever have the feeling you were meant
to do something extraordinary

SURESH
Im driving a cab You may have noticed

ETHAN
Im not talking about what you do Im
talking about who you are Im talking
about being special

SURESH
We are all special

ETHAN
(frustrated)
Thats not what I mean

SURESH
Some individuals it is true are more
special This is natural selection

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

ETHAN
(interesting)
Like evolution

SURESH
What is it that makes a species after
millions of years suddenly adapt to
catastrophic changes in their
environment Overnight Literally

We PUSH IN on Ethan as Suresh continues Ethan is riveted

SURESH (0S) (CONTD)
The ice age hits and a hundred thousand
species go extinct immediately

(snaps his fingers)

Like that While others no more unique
or complex change and adapt in
extraordinary ways insuring the survival
of their species The cockroach for
instance

We PUSH IN on Ethan as Sureshs lecture continues Ethan is
riveted This is speaking to the very core of his being

SURESH (CONTD)
It begins with a single individual
born or hatched like every other member
of their species Anonymous seemingly
ordinary Except theyre not They
carry inside them the genetic code that
will take their species to the next
evolutionary rung

Ethan is now staring off at nothing Slowly nodding his
head

SURESH (CONTD)
So if one feels they are special that
they have unique abilities then they
have an evolutionary imperative to
discover those abilities Its their
destiny

Ethan swallows He looks like hes about to leap out of his
skin No words have ever rung truer And breaking this
strange silence -- RING his cell Ethan jumps then answers

ETHAN
(to phone)
Hello Stella I was just going
home but No its no problem I
can be there in ten minutes Thats
okay Ill see you there

He hangs up

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

ETHAN (CONTD)
Can I get out here please

Suresh studies him for a beat then pulls the cab over
Ethan reaches into his pocket and pulls out a ten drops it
through the window of the partition He opens the door and
starts to get out

Ethan holds his gaze for a beat unable to speak Then turns
and rushes off Suresh watches him as another MAN slides

into the back seat We do NOT see his face but he is dressed
in a DARK SUIT And for a split second we think we catch

just a glimpse of his HORN RIMMED GLASSES

Suresh turns and looks at the man

SURESH
Where to my friend

FADE OUT

INT NIKI SANDERS GARAGE - NIGHT
TIGHT ON the luscious waves and folds of the BLUE SATIN
BEDSPREAD that we saw when we first met Niki Theyre

disrupted as --

WEASEL (0S)
Fifty grand is a lot of money

Niki is thrown onto her bed Violently (Only a minute and
fourteen seconds have passed since last we saw her) She
looks up at -- the WEASEL and the BIG GUY standing over her

WEASEL (CONTD)
But we wanna be fair about this

NIKI
Fifty It was thirty Even with
interest--

WEASEL
Shoulda read the fine print

The Weasel pulls up a chair as the Big Guy checks out her
computer and camera Niki looks at them desperately -

NIKI
Look I have a son I‘m all hes got
Please I can get the money

WEASEL
Tell you what lets start with a little
business proposition You make what
forty bucks every twenty minutes for
taking off your clothes

Niki looks at them unsure what hes getting at

WEASEL (CONTD)
Im gonna give you a chance to work off
a little of your debt See where it
goes from there

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205 49

The Big Guy hits the RECORD BUTTON on the camera Niki looks
at the red light on the camera The SLOW WHIR of the TAPE
TURNING echoes in the garage

WEASEL (CONTD)
(leaning back)
Go on lets see what you got

Niki sits up on her knees on the bed and slowly timidly
begins to rub her hands seductively up and down her body
She starts to cry but stops herself Gets into character
Undoes the buttons on her shirt -- starting at the top and
working her way down One by one Slow as she can

The two men smile And as she undoes the top button of her
jeans - she STOPS Looks at something just behind the two
men They notice Turn and look back behind them to see --
NIKIS REFLECTION

in the MIRROR that we saw the first time we were here
Nothing unusual They look back at Niki

But she keeps looking at her reflection
WEASEL (CONTD)
Whats the problem baby Its just
getting good
But Niki doesnt respond She just keeps staring at the
reflection The Weasel is pissed He stands crosses to
her BACKHANDS her across the face

WEASEL (CONTD)
I said whats your problem

Niki gets back up Scowls at him defiantly --

NIKI
Fuck you

The Weasel rears back and delivers a STRAIGHT HARD PUNCH
And as his fist comes RIGHT INTO CAMERA we

GLASSES waiting for him to respond (Were right where we

left off last time we were with Suresh)

HORNED RIMMED GLASSES

Suresh turns and starts driving After a long tense beat

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

HORNED RIMMED GLASSES (CONTD)
Suresh huh

Suresh startled looks back over his shoulder

SURESH
Im sorry

HORNED RIMMED GLASSES
Your name On your license there

Suresh looks down at his LICENSE and PHOTO displayed on the
dash

And now we get our first real look at the Man with the HORNED
RIMMED GLASSES A sort of young Max Von Sydow-type
Sophisticated unknowable Hes toying with Suresh He
knows exactly who he is

HORNED RIMMED GLASSES (CONTD)
Thats Indian yes

Suresh stares at him through his rear view mirror Those
GLASSES He knows them It lands Hard

HORNED RIMMED GLASSES (CONTD)
(musing)
Probably lots of Sureshs where your
from Like Smith or Anderso--

SKIIIDDDDD The tires LOCK as Suresh SLAMS on the BRAKES

The Man goes FLYING into the plexiglas partition SMASHING

his glasses against it It stuns him When he regains his
bearings he looks up to see Suresh is GONE

EXT STREET - SAME

We CRANE UP over the taxi its drivers door wide open and

see Suresh SPRINTING down the middle of the street weaving

in and out of the traffic And as Horned Rimmed Glasses

slowly climbs out and watches him disappear into the distance --

INT KARIOKI BAR - NIGHT 45

Ando stands at the bar (About forty seconds of time has
passed since we last saw them) He takes two bottles of
Asahi and turns back towards the table where he and Hiro
were sitting Hiro is gone He sees a COMMOTION near the
back of the place A BOUNCER is dragging Hiro out of the
womens bathroom as two WOMEN scream angrily at him

Ando watches the Bouncer drag Hiro right past him and out
the front door tossing him onto the sidewalk Ando looks
down at the beers in his hand shakes his head and sets them

down He heads for the door
HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

Claire looks back towards her desperately but Sandras still
in the other room clearing the table

CLAIRE

And just then her CLASS RING slips off her finger and INTO
the disposal Without thinking Claire PLUNGES her hand in
to retrieve it The disposal WHIRS and GRINDS hideously as
her fingers are GROUND in it She pulls her hand out and
in her BLOODY MANGLED FINGERS she holds the RING She
stares at it in no pain at all

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

SANDRA (0S)
I just dont think you should be so
worried about fitting in all the time
about being so popular

And Sandra comes back into the room Claire turns quickly
and hides her bloody hand behind her back as Sandra steps
right up to her and takes her lovingly by the shoulders

SANDRA (CONTD)
I dont want to see you make mistakes

more interesting than I am

CLAIRE

Claire and Sandra separate and head into --
INT LIVING ROOM - CLAIRES HOUSE CONTINUOUS

Where they find Kent standing in front of the TV Hes got
his back to them obscuring the TV from their view

SANDRA

KENT
(numbly )
The news

HE steps aside and we see ON THE TV - the FOOTAGE from the
FIRE Claire is CARRYING THE BOY out of the burning building
there for all the world to see this miraculous feat

Sandra and Kent both turn in unison to stare at Claire
speechless Off Claires enigmatic expression -- and one
second before she is about to speak we --

INT NIKI SANDERS GARAGE - NIGHT

Were IN REAL TIGHT on Nikis face lying in a smear of her
own blood on the BLUE SATIN BEDCOVER She slowly wakes
Disoriented she starts to sit up wondering where the hell
she is Then it hits her like a ton of bricks as she sees
something and GASPS

NIKIS POV

The place looks like a fucking TORNADO RIPPED THROUGH IT
Our two bad guys the WEASEL and the BIG GUY lay DEAD on the
floor And I mean real DEAD Theres BLOOD everywhere
Theyve been SAVAGELY BEATEN

BROKEN MIRROR SHARDS are everywhere One LARGE PIECE is
sticking out of the Weasels neck his eyes still wide open
The Big Guys own gun is SHOVED into his MOUTH a pool of
BLOOD behind his head

Niki stands up and STAGGERS off the bed She turns all the
way around totally freaked looking for the unseen culprit
of this insane KILLING SPREE

She backs up stepping over the Big Guys dead carcass and
BUMPS INTO the webcams tripod Catches it

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

Suddenly realizes that the cameras RED LIGHT is STILL ON
It dawns on her in a flash She shuts off the camera and
unclips it from the tripod Carrying it she starts to turn
when something catches her eye

Looking OVER HER SHOULDER from BEHIND her we now see what
it is -- The BUSTED MIRROR half the glass broken out of its
frame In the mirror - HER OWN REFLECTION She stares at
herself in the cracked pieces of glass dividing her like a
jigsaw puzzle

And suddenly like something out of a freaky horror film
her REFLECTION MOVES independent of her It RAISES its
blood drenched HAND and WIPES it nonchalantly on her shirt

And off Niki her life suddenly upside down --
EXT SING SING PRISON - NIGHT

Were TIGHT ON DLs FACE Again like when we first met
him hes asleep Then CHA CHUNK The unmistakable sound
of a SHOTGUN COCKING He wakes with a start Looks up
eyes wide

ADJUST to see two GUARDS standing over him We CRANE UP to
discover that we are right outside the razor wired fence of
the prison DL looks around no idea how he got here As
we slowly RISE to find the MOON in the sky --

EXT CITY STREET - TOKYO - NIGHT

We TILT DOWN from that same MOON to find Hiro strolling down
the empty sidewalk in this quiet business district He weaves
slightly from too much to drink He passes a TRAVEL AGENCY
Stops and stares at his own reflection the window

Along with the various TRAVEL POSTERS on display there is
wall of CLOCKS displaying the different TIME ZONES around
the world He closes his eyes from fatigue pinching the
bridge of his nose As he does we see EVERY CLOCK begin to
SPIN wildly

He opens his eyes back up and they stop He didnt notice
He nonchalantly glances up at a poster of TIMES SQUARE in
New York City all lit up at night

He stares it smiles and slowly turns to walk away He takes
a couple of steps and stops A stunned look on his face

He stares up and all around him and we SLOWLY PULL BACK to
find that Hiro is now standing smack in the middle of --

TIMES SQUARE

We RISE UP as Hiro spins around taking in this extraordinary
sight and --

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

INT LOFT - NIGAT

The door opens and Stella and Ethan enter the dark room
Stella has a flashlight

ETHAN
Im just saying its impossible No
one can predict the future

STELLA
I saw it with my own eyes
(yells)
Isaac I brought someone to help you
Hes a nurse

Theres no response Ethan follows behind her but stops
as something CRUNCHES beneath his feet She aims her light
down Its A SYRINGE Ethan stares at it

Stella aims the light up towards the radiator that Isaac
handcuffed himself to Hes NOT THERE Closer now and she
sees --

THE HANDCUFFS

One cuff is still locked to the radiator In the other cuff
a HAND SAWED OFF at the WRIST

STELLA (CONTD)
Oh god

ETHAN
Over there

Stella WHIPS the flashlight BEAM across the room to find

ISAAC

lying on the floor unconscious his bloody stump wrapped in
a towel In his one hand a paintbrush Stella rushes up
to him

STELLA
Jesus Isaac what have you done

But Ethan has come to a stop Hes seen something We dont
see it yet but it has stopped him dead in his tracks Then --

ETHANS POV -

A PAINTING on an easel half finished Its ETHAN Hes
LEAPING OFF a building wearing the same clothes hes wearing
right now arms outstretched like a swan dive

Ethan steps right up to the painting Reaches out and touches
his own image suspended in mid-air

HEROES VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

STELLA
tends to Isaac

STELLA (CONTD)
Im calling 911 Well get you to a
hospital

Isaacs eyes flutter open

ISAAC
(barely audible)
We have to stop it

And his eyes drift off indicating something over there
Stella follows his gaze and locks onto what hes looking at --

THE WALL

has been wildly PAINTED like a crazy person on a psychedelic
bender Giant bold brush strokes in half paint and half
blood -- The image of a HUGE NUCLEAR MUSHROOM CLOUD rising
ever the skyline of New York City

Ethan still frozen by his own image leaping off a building
finally senses something and turns to see the huge painting

on the wall And as he takes it all in --
FADE OUT AND INTO
EXT ROOFTOP OF BUILDING NIGHT

Close ON A PAIR OF SHOES DANGLING in mid-air We RISE UP to
find Ethan sitting on the ledge of a fifteen story building
legs over the side He looks down sees a TAXI pull up to
the alley below HARRISON hops out rushes to the edge of
the building looks up at him Ethan stands up on the ledge

HARRISON
(feigning nonchalance)
I got your message What are you doing
here Ethan

ETHAN
Finding out who I am

HARRISON
You know who you are Youre my brother
My better half The nicest guy on the
planet

ETHAN
(welling up)
Yeah Thats me Or at least it used
to be I can fly Harrison I just
need to do it I need to take the leap

VOLUME ONE Genesis 12205

HARRISON
And if you cant

ETBAN
Then at least Ill find out I was
born right next to you I guess Ill
die that way too

Ethan steps closer to the edge

HARRISON
Ethan dammit stop screwing around

ETHAN
No Its my turn to be somebody now

And he LEAPS off the ledge arms outstretched just like the
PAINTING Like he can fly But he doesnt and he DROPS
Actually PLUMMETS is a better word Like a stone Falling
and flailing Its awful And just as were convinced were
about ot witness a horrible death -- He STOPS In mid air
Its like in the first dream Except -- He looks down to
see --

HARRISON

HOLDING HIM UP FLOATING IN MID-AIR himself HE CAN FLY
They stare into each others eyes both as freaked by this
as the other

ETHAN (CONTD)
You How did you

HARRISON
II dont know

Ethan is heavy and Harrison unsteady He cant hold him
up Ethan SLIPS out of Harrisons arms Harrison GRABS
onto Ethans HAND suspending beneath him dangling by the
tips of his fingers

HARRISON (CONTD)
Ethan Oh god

A desperate beat as they try to hold on

ETHAN
Its okay I love you Harrison

And as Ethans fingers BEGIN TO SLIP Harrison HOLDS ON for
dear life as we --

SLAM TO BLACK
