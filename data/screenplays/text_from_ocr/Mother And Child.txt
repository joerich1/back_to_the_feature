flails her arms around and begins hitting everything
within her reach files a bowl of candy a computer
screen a bulletin board full of baby pictures a
Rolodex pens magazines The outburst lasts only a few
seconds long enough for all activity to stop and for

slows down a little as she approaches the edge and when

her cane confirms that she’s steps from it she kneels
down and travels the rest of the way on all fours

Violet kneels by the very edge and taps the side of the
building with her cane confirming the precipice below

Elizabeth comes out of the door and sees Violet

were my age

A beat

ELIZABETH
I did It didn’t scare me either

Elizabeth thinks about it

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
I felt like I wasn’t really there --
that I was invisible and disposable --
and that the world after me would be
like the world before me That I
wouldn’t leave a thing behind It wasn’t
a bad feeling really It was comforting
-- to feel like I was nothing

VIOLET
You should of doubled up on the
medication

Elizabeth laughs Then

VIOLET (CONTD)
I’m not nothing

Sometimes when we’re making out I feel
like we’re just -- one person -- all

tangled up I breathe in his breath and
it feels so good it makes me want to
cry

something to her slowly carefully Lucy listens in
silence then reacts badly and begins to scream She
rushes to the door and bangs on it and screams but is
pulled away by hospital staff and by Ada Ada tries to

girl’s face long and hard taking in every detail
touching her with the tips of her fingers -- like a blind
person trying to memorize the features

Karen gets up again and they all stand there in silence

INT KAREN’S BEDROOM - LATER 161
Paco is fast asleep Karen is writing in her notebook

KAREN (VO)
I never saw you With a new haircut
With new shoes When was your first
period Was someone there to help Did
anyone explain Did you hear the rain
one night when I heard it What gave
you comfort Ive missed it all -- and
I’ve accepted it But today I met Ella
Her little face is like a bird that
flies high over thirty-eight years that
have gone on and on and on like a
horrible parade But now it has passed
Only Ella remains God bless her Ella
is peace

She picks up the envelope that Sister Joanne gave her
(it’s already been opened by her before) and takes out a
letter and two photos She reads the letter and it makes
her smile

Karen puts the notebook aside and rests the photos on her
side table and lies down to look at them One photo is
the self-portrait of a pregnant Elizabeth the other is
the school photo of Elizabeth age 8

Karen looks at them -- scared curious marvelled -- then
turns out the lights
