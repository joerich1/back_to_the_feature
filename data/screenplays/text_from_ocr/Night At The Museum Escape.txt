Pi is the ratio of a circle’s

all about Pi

Capone reaches for the knapsack Napoleon slaps his hands
Then vice versa They stand there glaring at each other 4
moment then suddenly lunge at each other

Soon all three are piled on top of each other in a
pathetic awkward slapgrappling fight Tt looks like grade
school kids fighting

Larry staxts backing away right into a SPEAR He turns to
face Kahmunrah holding onto it

KAMHMUNRAH

themselves--

LARRY
a little move I like to call “Dividing
the House”

XAHMUNRAH

Yes well you should’ve gaved yourself
when you had the chance

Directly behind Kahmunrah Amelia has returned moves to the
gate finger to her lips motions Larry to keep quiet

KAHMUNRAH (CONTD)
At least I will have the pleasure of
killing you Night Guard

Suddenly another SWORD ENTERS FRAME the point digs into
Xamhmunrah’s neck We WIDEN TO REVEAL Ahkmenrah holding the
sword at his brother’s throat

AHKMENRAH

Kahmunrah drops his sword Behind him Amelia replaces the
tablet in its slot staxts working the combination

Brandon the young security guard who harassed Larry walks
along whistling cockily twirling his key-ring He turns a
corner entering the Commons and immediately stops dead in
his tracks

WHAT HE SBES

Sunlight streams in through the broken arched window The
Wright Flyer sits upside down but somehow still intact at one
end of the Commons The whole place is trashed littered with

toppled displays and other detritus of the battle royale from
the night before

Brandon stands there a moment taking in the incredible
scene trying not to cry

BRANDON
Well there is no way Brandon is cleaning
this up

Brandon slowly walks over to where Amelias Lockheed Vega has
crash landed As he comes around the plane he sees the wax
figure of Amelia Earhart sitting on the wing facing east
towards the sunrise

And if you look close enough which we do you’d sse the
barest hint of a smile on her face We then
