EXT OUTSIDE RAILWAY STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY

England early 1950s Summer A station in a commuter town
thirty miles from London

Morning rush Men with bowler hats dark suits briefcases
rolled umbrellas converge on the station entrance

EXT STATION - PLATFORM ONE - DAY

A Mother 30s and an uniformed Schoolboy 12 stand together
on the platform awaiting their train

She is reading a magazine He is reading a comic

Behind them and in front of them bowler-hatted Commuters
stream past all hurrying in the same direction to reach the
other platform

At any moment the Mother and Schoolboy might get swept up
into the tide of commuters But the tide continues to part
around them leaving them unscathed

The Mother and Schoolboy remain absorbed in their reading
completely ignoring the Commuter tide

EXT STATION - PLATFORM TWO - DAY

The tide’s destination is this platform across the tracks It
is already packed with other Commuters standing shoulder to
shoulder Many read newspapers folded back and held out
before them

PETER 24 is dressed identically to his fellow commuters
though his suit is of a lighter shade and less broken in

He’s glancing about nervously looking for something or
someone

He attempts to shift position within the crowd bumps into a
Gent standing behind him reading his newspaper

PETER
Oh So sorry

Gent mumbles without looking up carries on reading
Two Schoolboys push past almost knocking Peter over He

recovers resolves to stand with more dignity in his
designated space
Then he sees what he’s been looking for

Three bowler-hatted men standing together further along
platform MIDDLETON late-40s HART mid-40s RUSBRIDGER
late-20s

PETER raises a hand half-heartedly They don’t see him

He raises his hand more boldly waves

Hart notices draws attention of Middleton and Rusbridger
All three gaze neutrally towards Peter

Peter smiles starts to go towards them hesitates
Middleton taking charge gestures for Peter to come over
PETER (CONTD)
(squeezing past)
Excuse me
He reaches the others
PETER (CONTD)
(too loud)

Good morning

MIDDLETON HART RUSBRIDGER
(subdued)
Good morning

PETER
So Here I am All ready for
battle
Beat
MIDDLETON

Id better introduce you This is
Mr Peter Wakeling our new
colleague Mr Wakeling Mr Hart Mr
Rusbridger

PETER HART RUSBRIDGER
(shaking hands)
How do you do

HART
Youre eagerly awaited Mr
Wakeling We’ve been short now for
nearly two months

PETER
Well I hope to make a difference
(laughs)
May take a week or two though
Middleton Hart and Rusbridger smile but don’t laugh

RUSBRIDGER

(to Peter sotto)
Don’t worry old chap We’1ll all
get a lot livelier once we’re in
London

(indicates)
This time of morning it’s a kind
of rule Not too much fun and
laughter Rather like church

Peter looks down platform

Rows of bowlers dark suits folded back newspapers No-one
is talking

PETER

Hmm I see what you mean
EXT STATION - PLATFORM TWO - MOMENTS LATER
Train comes in Steam Commuters jostle politely but firmly
NB The train has old-style carriages divided into individual
compartments each with a door opening to the platform
INT RAIL COMPARTMENT - TRAVELLING EXT SCENERY - DAY
Train is moving They have secured a compartment to
themselves Middleton and Hart on one side Peter and
Rusbridger opposite
No-one is talking Middleton and Hart have got out documents
and are studying them Rusbridger is reading the sports page

of his newspaper

Peter looks at his new colleagues He almost speaks stops
himself gazes at view out of window

After a few beats Rusbridger takes pity

RUSBRIDGER
First day’s always a bit nerve-
racking

PETER
Yes

RUSBRIDGER

You’1l get the hang of it As for
these chaps here they’1l improve
somewhat once they wake up
MIDDLETON
(not looking up)
It’s not us you have to worry
about Mr Wakeling We’re your
pals But you’ll need to get on the
right side of the old man

PETER
You mean Mr Williams

Silence

PETER (CONTD)
He seemed a decent sort at the
interview Perhaps on the frosty
side but er Truth is I didn’t
get to see much of him --

HART

You’re about to get another chance
just now Here’s his station coming

up
EXT VILLAGE STATION - DAY

Train slowing as it comes into small leafy ‘countryside’
station on commuter line Steam

INT RAIL COMPARTMENTEXT VILLAGE STATION - DAY

Middleton Hart and Rusbridger have put down their reading
and are leaning forward to the window

Peter looks out apprehensive
In the window the Waiting Passengers on the platform outside
glide by as train slows A smaller crowd than at previous

station but large proportion are bowler-hatted

As the train stops the window neatly frames WILLIAMS out on
the platform waiting to board

Williams is tall angular elegant early 60s Dressed
immaculately in the commuters’ uniform

He gazes into their compartment raises his rolled umbrella
in subdued greeting

Middleton Hart and Rusbridger immediately touch or raise
their bowler hats

Peter hesitates also raises hat but by then Williams has
gone OUT OF VIEW to board the train
DOORS SLAM up and down the train

PETER
Is he coming in here

HART
Oh no Never travels with us But
he always manages to be at exactly
the right spot to greet us The way
he was just now

MIDDLETON
Rather mysterious the way he gets
it right every morning

RUSBRIDGER
He must watch us go by and run
along the platform

HART
Can you imagine Mr Williams running
along the platform
(to Peter)
Train stops and there he is Every
morning Very calm

RUSBRIDGER
But how else is it possible He
must spot us and run

PETER
But why would he bother

RUSBRIDGER
Why Just Mr Williams I suppose
It’s what he does every morning
Before we came along I expect he
did the exact same thing to our
predecessors

Peter looks around anxiously as if Williams might burst into
their compartment at any moment
EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The train journeys on

EXT WATERLOO STATION - NEAR TICKET BARRIER - DAY

ON A huge SEASIDE POSTER advertising a break in a resort
town ‘JUST 90 MINUTES BY RAIL FROM VICTORIA’

It shows sea beach blue sky pier Ferris wheels happy
families

MOVE DOWN to discover Peter Middleton Hart and Rusbridger
amidst crowds They’ve just come through the barrier

Peter starts to push his way into the crowd but Middleton
stops him indicates they must wait

The four men become stationary while crowd moves around them
They look back to the barrier

Williams emerges comes towards them

WILLIAMS
Good morning gentlemen

MIDDLETON HART RUSBRIDGER
Good morning sir Good morning
Mr Williams

WILLIAMS
(looking Peter up and
down )
You appear taller than at your
interview

Beat

WILLIAMS (CONTD)

I do hope youll be comfortable
with us

PETER
Thank you sir I hope to make a
contribution

Williams strides off Peter is about to follow but again
Middleton stops him

Middleton Hart and Rusbridger watch until Williams is
sufficiently ahead Only then do they start to move

Peter follows

EXT WATERLOO STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Morning rush on streets Summer

EXT OUTSIDE COUNTY HALL - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Massive grand building on south bank of Thames
EXT OUTSIDE COUNTY HALL NORTH BLOCK - DAY

Entrance to this section of building Office Workers male
and female ascend steps and pass in through double doors
held open by Porters

INT COUNTY HALL NORTH BLOCK - ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

Impressive Art Deco hall Signs pointing to ‘FIRE DEPT’
‘EDUCATION DEPT’ etc

Broad central staircase leading up to upper levels at
present filled with ascending Office Workers

FAVOUR Williams within this tide He now seems just one among
Many patiently taking his place in the slow procession up
the stairs

INT COUNTY HALL NORTH BLOCK - SECOND FLOOR - CORRIDOR

A quiet corridor

Williams comes into it walks a few strides Then stops
surprised

Further down the corridor SIR JAMES emerging from a door
SIR JAMES 60s Chairman of London County Council walking
regally in Williams’s direction Although the corridor is
wide enough for them both to pass Williams steps aside
waits

In marked contrast to his earlier demeanour he now appears
very deferential

Sir James strolls past hardly looking at Williams
WILLIAMS
(sotto)

Good morning Sir James

SIR JAMES
Hmm

Williams waits till Sir James turns out of the corridor then
resumes walking

INT COUNTY HALL NORTH BLOCK - SECOND FLOOR - OUTER OFFICE

A large room Lined with desks arranged in neat rows Office
Workers installing themselves behind each desk getting ready
for the day ahead

SINGH a clerk carrying folders comes down aisle between
desks walks past a door to an adjoining office

It is marked ‘PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT’

INT OFFICE - TABLE - DAY

NOISE of TYPING in background CLOSE SHOT - A TOWER OF PAPERS
AND FOLDERS stacked precariously on a wooden table

A name sign before it reads ‘MR WAKELING’
PETER peers around the tower studies it nervously

We now see he is seated at the table behind the tower There
are six people sitting and working around the table each
with their own tower

On one side Rusbridger Hart and MARGARET HARRIS early 20s -
though we don’t yet favour her

On the other side Middleton and Peter

Williams is at the head of the table his back to two tall
windows He has that side of the table to himself wearing
once again his confident poised air

Aside from the name signs the towers help to mark out each
official’s territory

Williams has two such towers to either side of him

CLOSE ON PETER trying to extract a sheet from his tower He
almost brings it down hastily restores it to stability

MARGARET (0S)
Consider yourself very fortunate
Mr Wakeling

Across the table Margaret is looking at him from behind her
own tower

MARGARET (CONTD)
Bequeathed one of our tallest
skyscrapers Courtesy of Mr
Woodward your predecessor

Peter looks around at others at Williams
The others Williams included keep working eyes down
MARGARET (CONTD)
Imagine if you’d arrived here and

there’d been no skyscraper for you
(MORE )
MARGARET (CONTD)
It could take you a good few days
to build one as tall as that

Peter studies his skyscraper closely

MARGARET (CONTD)

If your skyscraper isn’t very tall
Or God forbid you work so fast you
don’t have one at all

(looks round table stage

whisper)
Then people will suspect you of not
having anything very important to
do

Hart and Rusbridger snicker quietly without looking up
Middleton looks disapprovingly at Margaret
Williams gives no reaction

PETER
I see

MARGARET
So here’s your first rule Mr
Wakeling Keep your skyscraper
high

He’s at a loss how to respond But he’s smitten by Margaret

He smiles at her She grins back mischievously

Then she bows to her tower of papers as if it’s a religious
object

Hart and Rusbridger laugh quietly
Middleton frowns
Williams looks up watching Margaret expressionlessly Then
WILLIAMS
Mr Rusbridger Why has this D19
come back to us
He holds up a document
RUSBRIDGER
Mr Wright at Planning was of the

view that a remittance certificate
should be attached to it

WILLIAMS
A remittance certificate can only
be issued after the D19 is
authorised

RUSBRIDGER
Yes I tried to tell Mr Wright
that Mr Williams But he simply
won’t have it
Williams looks at the folder in his hand thinks
MARGARET
Mr Rusbridger why didn’t you try
bribing that horrid Mr Wright All
you’d need is a photo of Tessie
OShea
Hart Rusbridger and this time Middleton all laugh
Peter not in on joke smiles anyway

Williams doesn’t react continues to consider the folder

Then he inserts it decisively midway into the tower to his
left

WILLIAMS
Then we can keep it here for now
It’ll do no harm
Williams’s gaze turns to the next document
The others resume their work
Singh comes INTO VIEW passing through the small gate into
the ‘privileged’ area sectioned off from the rest of the room
by a waist-high mahogany rail
They all look up at him
SINGH
(addressing Williams)
The ladies from Chester Street
sir
An ironic groan goes around the table Peter is intrigued
Williams looks around the table all avoid his gaze
WILLIAMS
Please show the ladies in Mr

Singh

Singh nods goes OUT OF VIEW

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
Mr Middleton Your turn if you
dont mind

Middleton suppresses sigh rises

MIDDLETON
Of course Mr Williams

Middleton goes OUT OF VIEW towards the barrier

WILLIAMS
Mr Wakeling Perhaps you’d like to
assist Mr Middleton with the
ladies

PETER
Of course sir

Peter rises nearly upsetting his tower as he does so

Margaret grins Peter smiles goes OUT OF VIEW

INT OFFICE - BARRIER RAIL - DAY

folder

MRS SMITH

MIDDLETON

Mr Williams has suggested you be
accompanied this time by a member
of our staff To ensure there’s no
further confusion

(looks at Peter)
This is Mr Wakeling

The women all look at Peter

PETER
Oh Splendid Then I’11 make
sure all this confusion

MRS MCMASTERS
That’s lovely son Then you’d
better hop over to our side of the
fence

PETER
Yes
(passes through gate)
Well if you ladies would care to
follow me

He starts to lead them out Singh holds open the door
Then Peter realises he doesn’t know the way
MRS SMITH

Allow me to lead the way We’re

perhaps more familiar with this

building than you are
INT OFFICE - TABLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Williams looks up gazes after Peter and the ladies a
concern - even a conscience - momentarily detectable in his

expression

Middleton takes his seat at the table

WILLIAMS
(looks down at his work)
Miss Harris Is it really true you

MARGARET

seemed to go well They’re going to
let me know
(to others)

WILLIAMS
A Lyons Corner House
(beat)
Is that a respectable job for a
nice young lady

It takes a moment to realise Williams is making a joke They
all laugh

RUSBRIDGER
So will you become one of those

Nippys

HART

Miss Harris

MARGARET

Harris
RUSBRIDGER

They do an excellent treacle
sponge At least the one in
Coventry Street does

Margaret cross gets on with her work
Williams gazes at her expressionlessly then he steals a

glance at his watch A tension enters his manner as he notes
the time

MIDDLETON
Good idea sir

Williams doesn’t respond He’s still staring at his watch
then realises he’s been addressed looks up

WILLIAMS
Mmm

MIDDLETON

blimming dangerous everywhere

MRS PORTER

Peter startled stops looks around

PETER

Perhaps Mr Middleton You’d be so
good as to deputise in my absence
MIDDLETON
Of course Mr Williams I’1l see

Hart is annoyed by this

It’s unclear if Williams intends to say something else

An awkward silence Then Williams notices Peter standing
beside him with the folder

WILLIAMS
Mr Wakeling What may I do for you

PETER

INT HALLWAYSTAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

Williams looks up The staircase rises to a half landing
turns continues up a second flight OUT OF VIEW

A MURMUR OF VOICES from upstairs Williams starts up taking
each stair with care

Three steps before the turn he stops a hand on the rail

FIONA (0S)
--I do hope he’s not upset

MICHAEL (0S)
Of course he’d be upset If he
heard us But look darling this
might be for the best

FIONA (0S)
How can it possibly be --

MICHAEL (0S)
If we’re ever to have our own home
have our own life We need to grasp

the nettle Make him understand we
can’t just keep

Williams reverses carefully down the stairs He reaches the
bottom lets go the rail

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT

Williams enters glances around reaches for the wall switch

The room falls into darkness again only lit by the street
light

Williams goes back to the armchair sits His posture remains
as upright as before his expression reveals little

But there are traces of tears in his eyes

INT OFFICE - TABLE - DAY

HART
(looking at watch)
But he’s never late Something must
have happened

Middleton Hart Rusbridger Margaret and Peter sit around
the table each behind their towers and name signs

Williamss seat is empty

MIDDLETON
Daughter-in-law said he’d left as
usual this morning

HART
Very odd

PETER
I say Do you think we should you
know alert the police

MIDDLETON
Mr Williams is hardly an infant
What will the police care that he’s
a couple of hours late for work

RUSBRIDGER
‘A couple of hours late for work’
Who would ever have thought

HART
Leaves early yesterday Late today
You don’t suppose you know that
he’s just had enough Decided to
pack it all in

Beat

Peter notices Middleton Hart and Rusbridger have momentarily
stopped working

Margaret too notices exchanges glance with Peter

MIDDLETON
(awkward)
I don’t appreciate that suggestion
Mr Hart In fact I find it in
rather poor taste

They resume working - signing stamping reading

MARGARET
A pity he should choose today of
all days

RUSBRIDGER
Why’s that Miss Harris

MARGARET
Because the Lyons Corner House have
requested my reference So I needed
Mr Williams to --

MIDDLETON
If it’s a reference you’re after
Miss Harris Id be happy to step
in As Mr Williams’s deputy --

HART
Now hold on He’s just a little
late that’s all --

MARGARET
Quite Thank you Mr Middleton but
Id prefer to wait for Mr Williams
to return

Middleton knows he’s asserted himself too quickly

MIDDLETON
As you wish Miss Harris

Everyone returns to work Hart sees Middleton turn to
Williamss empty seat

INT MRS BLAKES CAFE - EVENING

English seaside cafe situated on a pier Booths Fading light
through windows

The cafe has at present two customers sitting apart

For now we focus only on SUTHERLAND late 40s at a table
near the front He’s writing in an exercise book having made
himself very much at home - loose pages pens coffee cup
before him

He wears a good suit but as though he doesn’t care if he
ruins it No tie

He is addressing the owner MRS BLAKE early 50s aproned
standing near her counter

SUTHERLAND
Cocoa A cup of cocoa Cocoa Mrs
Blake will barely scratch the
topsoil of the vast mountain that
is my sleeplessness I need strong
medicine Mrs Bee I need
tranquillised against this eternal
hamster’s wheel of wakefulness And
you talk to me of cocoa

Mrs Blake shakes her head lips tight She’s used to this

SUTHERLAND (CONTD)
How can it be that in this
colourful and popular resort town
of ours insomniacs converging from
every corner of the land how is it
a fellow’s not able to buy such a
thing as a sleeping tablet

MRS BLAKE
Oh you don’t half go on Mr
Sutherland If you was really
sleeping as little as you says I
don’t see how your brain can keep
coming out with all these
ridiculous phrases Never mind all
of your well ‘entertainments’
shall we call them

SUTHERLAND
There That accusatory tone again
That prudery It creeps back It is
your constant curse Mrs Blake as
it is mine to be English

MRS BLAKE
I’m very proud to be English I’1l
have you know

SUTHERLAND
Consider I beg you my last great
work ‘Shocking Stockings’
Performed upon this very pier last
summer for all of three weeks and
two days Now I very much suspect
you have judged it to be smutty and
trivial --

MRS BLAKE
You know very well Mr Sutherland
I never saw it It’s not for me
that kind of thing

SUTHERLAND
My point exactly The dramatic
vision of your most loyal customer
Devotee of your stubborn fish
suppers Of your ironic apple
turnovers Performed on the very
pier to which your own
establishment clings And you shun
it Turn away with a blush Because
youre too English Mrs Bee Would
it have been that way in Paris In
Pigalle where triumphantly
disowned by my entire family I so
deliciously misspent my youth Over
there they know what true living
is The night the wine the women
the cabaret the Moulin Rouge Do
you see Picasso Degas blushing
and frowning upon it the way you
do Who knows Mrs Blake Had you
been born French who knows You
might even now be kicking high
those lovely legs of yours for the
appreciation of a discerning
audience --

MRS BLAKE
Mr Sutherland Really --

SUTHERLAND
This little town of ours Mrs
Blake English it may be but I
still have high ambitions for it
Bournemouth Bognor Regis they’re
long beyond reach But here hope
still lingers Our own version of
the can-can francaise may yet
sprout from out of the mud of our
Knees Up Mother Brown I look at
you even now Mrs Blake and I can
see you coquettish with a fur
stole --

MRS BLAKE
Mr Sutherland I will not have any
more such talk in my --

SUTHERLAND
I could achieve all this all this
and more for this town if only
If only I could sleep Sleep
Consider my fate Mrs Bee One
grandfather a moderately feted
poet Two uncles both very
dreadful novelists

(MORE)

SUTHERLAND (CONTD)
Now it falls to me to steer the
family line into playwrighting
Shakespeare Marlowe I grew up
with them And if only I could
sleep at night I might even now be
standing where they once stood Oh
why won’t the pharmacists sell
sleeping tablets What are they
afraid of

VOICE (0S)
(quietly)
Excuse me

Sutherland and Mrs Blake turn to the speaker

The other customer till now obscured by the booth is
Williams He is dressed in a noticeably less formal style

He is raising a finger in the air

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
I don’t mean to intrude

SUTHERLAND
You do not intrude sir In fact
youre most welcome to join our
conference here

WILLIAMS
That’s most kind But I wondered
If I might have a word in private
with the gentleman

Sutherland and Mrs Blake swap glances

MRS BLAKE
(moves to the kitchen)
I don’t know I’11 leave you to it
The things that go on

Sutherland rises comes down past the empty tables to
Williamss booth

SUTHERLAND
Well sir May I take it you’re
inviting me aboard

WILLIAMS
(indicates seat opposite)
If you’d care to

Sutherland sits noticing that Williams has left most of his
fish and chips untouched

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
Excuse me I just thought
overhearing what you were saying

He’s fumbling in his briefcase near his feet He produces a
pharmacist’s packet

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
If you like

(handing over packet)
Youre welcome to these

SUTHERLAND
Very kind of you old man Just
what I need

Williams now takes out three more identical packets and
places them on the table between them

WILLIAMS
These too You’re very welcome

SUTHERLAND
Rather a lot old man

Sutherland and Williams look at each other across table
Suddenly Sutherland reaches over takes remaining packets
SUTHERLAND (CONTD)
I’m grateful to you I’1ll take
them off your hands
Williams laughs
WILLIAMS

I did think about it But I don’t
have it in me That kind of thing

SUTHERLAND
Think of the inconvenience to your
landlady
WILLIAMS
Odd I thought about exactly that
(beat)

It’s not quite what you think You
see this is rather a bore but
The doctors have given me six
months eight or nine at a stretch

Sutherland despite his customary flippant manner is a
decent person and his concern is genuine

SUTHERLAND
I’m so sorry

WILLIAMS
Funny You’re the first person I’ve
told The thing is I just came
down here and Look you’re very
welcome to those I’ve no more need
of them

SUTHERLAND
Six months Nine It doesn’t
seem long But it’s something
Enough time to get things in order
And to live a little if you chose
to

WILLIAMS
When I was listening to you just
now I was wondering how a chap
like you what you’d do If you
only had six months left

SUTHERLAND
I’m not the man to ask You’re
clearly a gentleman if I may say
so I may pass for one but I’m
not like you at all These days I’m
one of the misbegotten I write
my saucy seaside farces by day Do
what I can to entertain myself at
night

WILLIAMS
(gestures to the window)
You do that here

SUTHERLAND
Oh yes This time of year town can
rise to some colour

Williams looks out of the window then back at Sutherland

WILLIAMS
I withdrew some money Almost half
of my life’s savings Look

Williams struggles to lift up his briefcase
Sutherland recoils holds up his hands

SUTHERLAND
Look old chap Enough of that You
have to be more careful

WILLIAMS
(lowering briefcase)
You see my problem I withdrew this
cash and came down here
(MORE)

WILLIAMS (CONTD)

to enjoy myself To live a little
as you put it

(laughs self-consciously)
But I realise I don’t know how
Just now when I was listening to
you talking I thought a fellow
like that it’d be easy for him
He’d know Despite all your
complaints I thought he
wouldnt find it hard

(lifts briefcase again)
So I wondered Of course you’d be
fully entitled to refuse But I
wondered if you weren’t busy
and

(laughs)

since you’re not a big one for
sleeping if you’d help me spend
this money Tonight Out there

Sutherland leans back thinks

SUTHERLAND
This can be a quite wonderful town
this time of year What’s more it
has an underbelly elusive to the
average holiday-maker Ill be
delighted to be your guide However
there’s one condition

Williams looks at him waits
SUTHERLAND (CONTD)
You don’t touch a penny of that
there You’1l find better use for
it This tour will be on me

WILLIAMS
But really --

SUTHERLAND
I insist Those are my terms sir
Do say yes

INT SEAFRONT AMUSEMENT ARCADE - NIGHT

Glassy brightly-lit palace of penny arcade games one-armed
bandits ‘What The Butler Saw’ ‘Gypsy Fortune Teller’ etc

Outside night has fallen

Williams bowler hat on is bent over a machine Six Holiday-
makers elsewhere in the arcade

Sutherland comes INTO VIEW stands a little way behind
Williams

SUTHERLAND
What have you found old man

Williams is too absorbed to reply We stay on Williams’s
face rigid with excited child-like concentration

WILLIAMS
(to himself sotto)
Yes yes Just a little more A
little more

Sutherland smiles pleased

A range of emotions rapidly crosses Williamss face
reflecting his changing fortunes

Then sudden anguish

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
(straightening)
Oh That’s wretched They must have
it fixed It’s some sort of

optical illusion

Williams starts to put more coins in

SUTHERLAND
(stops him)
Give that up old man Come and
look at this You might have more
luck

Williams is reluctantly led away by Sutherland He throws
resentful glances back at the machine

They cross the arcade and come to

A CRANE GAME

(A glass cabinet houses a pile of small prizes A miniature
crane dangles over prizes The aim is to pick up the prize of
one’s choice and to drop it into the chute mouth for
collection)

Williams peers into the cabinet at the prizes The crane’s
jaws hang over boxes of sweet cigarettes small plastic toys

trinkets

The star prize is a fluffy toy rabbit larger and brighter
than everything else

Sutherland is pleased to see Williams freshly absorbed

SUTHERLAND (CONTD)
Always that same rabbit It’s what
one wants But can’t quite get
Williams stares at the rabbit The rabbit stares back
SUTHERLAND (CONTD)
Go on old man Have a go I’m sick

of trying

Williams looks at Sutherland who has suddenly become
melancholy

Williams turns back to the machine puts in two coins
The cabinet lights up TINNY MUSIC starts

Williams takes the handles starts to manipulate the crane
concentrating hard closing in on the rabbit

Sutherland notices Williams’s serious attitude
SUTHERLAND (CONTD)
(murmuring)

Youre doing well Doing well

Williams slowly lowers jaws of crane over the rabbit
Adjusts lowers again The jaws open wider

SUTHERLAND (0S) (CONTD)
Youll have to hurry old man

Suddenly the MUSIC and lights cut out The crane becomes
still hovering over the rabbit

WILLIAMS
I I wasn’t quick enough

Williams is inordinately disappointed Sutherland claps him
on the back

SUTHERLAND
Enough of this old man Let’s go
Time to see more

WILLIAMS
Next time I have to --

SUTHERLAND
Come on
INT PUB - NIGHT

Crowded Saloon bar Williams and Sutherland drinking on high
stools at bar watching revellers

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Williams still with bowler hat and Sutherland push their
way through a back alley crowded with Local Young Men
Servicemen Young Women passing lit doorways and windows
from which come competing MUSIC

Williams is now quite unlike the man from County Hall amazed
by what he is seeing and feeling

He stops looks around him Sutherland takes his arm to keep
him moving

GIRL’S VOICE (0S)
Hey Hey you there Mr City Gent

Williams breaks away from Sutherland to look back

A gaudily dressed GIRL emerges from the crowd snatches
Williams’s bowler hat from his head retreats laughing into
the crowd

Williams bewildered starts to go after the Girl
Sutherland pulls him back

SUTHERLAND
Let it go old man Girl like that
steals your hat always cheaper to
buy a new one

WILLIAMS
But --

SUTHERLAND
Well get you a new one It can
mark the new phase of your life
Out with the old

WILLIAMS
(waving arms in air)
Yes Out with the old In with --

Williams staggers into an Oncomer

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
Oh Excuse me excuse me

Sutherland supports Williams till he regains balance
SUTHERLAND

That’s what we need A new hat For
a new era

WILLIAMS
Where on earth can a chap
find a new hat at this time of
night

INT PUB - NIGHT

Through a busy bar crowd we find Williams and Sutherland
leaning against a back wall talking now noticeably drunk

Around them boisterous holiday revellers wash by in search
of drink and laughter

A Drunken Man comes to take a seat next to them Sutherland
finds Williams’s gaze drift toward the man’s impressive
fedora hat

INT PUB - NIGHT

According to licensing laws this pub should be closed But
it has closed only its curtains and become a ‘private club’

Around 20 CUSTOMERS middle-aged sit or stand around the
piano singing popular songs Two Couples dance half-
heartedly slowly in the middle of the floor

The SINGING is led by the PIANO MAN who also ACCOMPANIES
Williams and Sutherland sit at the bar They are very drunk
Williams has on the fedora we last saw on the Drunken Man

SUTHERLAND
A bargain I tell you

WILLIAMS
He’d have gone down to half a
crown I’m sure of it

SUTHERLAND

Half a crown It’s a quality hat A
bargain

(to BARMAN behind bar)
Harry This here is my friend Mr
Rodney Williams of Esher Surrey
Would you know it This man before
you now is grievously ill

BARMAN
What’s the matter with him

SUTHERLAND
Stomach A death sentence

BARMAN
Then why’s he drinking

SUTHERLAND
Why indeed Another man a lesser
man might crawl into a hole and
weep Await his hour with gloom and
dread Not Mr Williams He has
decided to grasp life what little
of it remains to him We have to
admire him for it Don’t you admire
him Harry

Williams is sitting with eyes closed swaying lightly to the
singing behind him His lips move along to the song

BARMAN
If he’s not well this ain’t good
for him

SUTHERLAND

Harry You don’t understand This
man who until yesterday had been
living a shell of an existence has
sprung to life Look He even has a
new hat

BARMAN
(regards hat)
One size too large Id say

APPLAUSE LAUGHS and CHEERS as the song at the piano closes

PIANO MAN
All right All right Come on
What’s to be next What else do we
know Let’s have someone new
What’s next

Williams opens his eyes turns raises a hand

WILLIAMS
Yes Yes I have a song
PIANO MAN
Ah And what might you offer us

sir

Williams gets off his stool unsteadily leans against bar
faces the room

WILLIAMS
I I have a little Scotch on my
mother’s side --

VOICE (0S)
Looks like you’ve got a little
Scotch in you right now mate

LAUGHTER Williams smiles waves for quiet

WILLIAMS
You’re right I’m somewhat Even
so I’d like to sing a song for you
if I may That is sir sir
(to Piano Man)
If you happen to know The Rowan
Tree

PIANO MAN
(searching memory)
The Rowan Tree Old Scottish song

WILLIAMS
Yes I have a little Scotch in me
And my late wife She too

Piano Man plays a run starts on an arrangement

None of the Customers around the piano know this song but
Piano Man does

PIANO MAN
(singing)
‘Oh Rowan Tree oh Rowan Tree
Thou’lt aye be dear to me
Entwined thou art wi’ mony ties
O’ hame and infancy’

Williams joins in quietly at first then with growing
confidence Not a great singer but he has a heart-felt
quality that captures the attention His gaze remains distant
as he sings

After a few lines Piano Man leaves the singing to Williams
carries on accompanying

WILLIAMS
(singing)
‘ Thy leaves were aye the first
o’ spring
Thy flow’rs the summer’s pride
There was nae such a bonny tree
In a’ the countryside’

The Customers Sutherland Barman sense Williams’s
melancholy watch and listen silently

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
(singing)

‘How fair wert thou in summer time
wi’ a’ thy clusters white
How rich and gay thy autumn dress
wi’ berries red and bright
On thy fair stem were many names
which now nae mair I see
But they’re engraven on my heart
Forgot they ne’er can be

We sat aneath thy spreading shade
The bairnies round thee ran

They pu’d thy bonny berries red
And necklaces they strang

My mother oh I see her still

Williams trails off stops singing Piano Man goes on
playing
WILLIAMS (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m so sorry This is
too I didn’t mean to

Piano Man stops playing Hesitant APPLAUSE around the room

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
I’m spoiling your evening

Sutherland rises puts arm around Williams’s shoulders

SUTHERLAND
Come along old man I’1l1 show
you another place I know Come

on chin up You’re doing well

Piano Man starts up an UP-TEMPO SONG The Customers
immediately start to sing along

Williams and Sutherland leave

INT PIANO BAR - REAR STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Sutherland and Williams come through a set of doors Before
them stairs leading down to a back exit PIANO and SINGING
remain faintly audible

Williams pauses at top stair hurls fist in the air - a
triumphant but oddly empty gesture As he does so he almost
falls down the steps but Sutherland steadies him in time

SUTHERLAND
Come along old chap Let me now
show you something really special
Strictly VIPs only

They descend steps together leave through doorway

EXT TENT - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A large tent illuminated from within on the edge of a field
near an unseen fairground

A powerful light somewhere nearby is going on and off
rhythmically

From within the tent MUFFLED SOUND of a BOISTEROUS CROWD
SINGING ‘Roll Out The Barrel’ backed by ACCORDION DRUMS and
TRUMPET

INT TENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

MUSIC and SINGING now much louder

The tent’s interior feels stifling sagging canvas
‘ceilings’ garish lighting closely packed benches and
wooden chairs arranged in rows across the trodden grass
floor

An audience of twenty Men and twelve Hostesses distributed
among them swaying and singing Everyone appears to be
drunk

All gazes remain fixed on the make-shift stage where

A Dancer in a bizarre military costume is performing a
striptease

The SINGING builds in momentum to egg on the Dancer

An Accordionist Drummer and Trumpeter RAMP UP THE MUSIC’S
TEMPO

APPLAUSE and CHEERS as the Dancer discards an item of
clothing

In the midst of the audience Williams seated arm in arm
with Hostess 1 Beside them Sutherland arm in arm with
Hostess 2

Both are now very drunk and in danger of falling asleep

Hostess 1 gives Williams a shake Williams makes an effort to
focus on the Dancer

Sutherland’s eyes are closing but he forces them open looks
at stage smiles as More APPLAUSE and CHEERS greet another
gesture from the Dancer

SINGING continues boisterously

Hostess 1 mouths the words to the song encourages Williams
to join in Williams starts to sing along

Suddenly he stops his expression freezing as a stab of
internal pain assaults him

For a beat he remains frozen in an unnatural posture while
Hostess 1 continues to sing an arm inside Williams’s arm

Williams pulls away from her rises Stumbles past Men and
Hostesses in his row towards the flap in the tent’s rear
with the urgency of one about to vomit

Sutherland noticing disentangles himself from Hostess 2
goes down row reaches flap Nods to Doorman as he goes out

EXT FIELD OUTSIDE TENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Dark no-man’s land between fringe tents and the main
fairground Sutherland emerges looks around

The powerful light from nearby as before going on and off
rhythmically illuminating erratically the patch of field
immediately before him Beyond that is darkness

Beat

Williams emerges from the dark into the erratic light He has
lost his urgency He dabs his mouth with a handkerchief
looks up sees Sutherland stops

They stare at each other now both strangely sober Williams
appears as if caught in the act of doing something shameful
He touches his handkerchief to his mouth again

Sutherlands expression filled with pity and horror as if
the full import of William’s condition - indeed of Death
itself - has only now dawned on him

They continue to stare at each other SINGING and MUSIC
continue from the tent

Williams smiles sheepishly gives a small nod towards the
tent indicating he’s ready to return

He dabs his mouth again puts away handkerchief approaches
Sutherland continues to stare at him in horror allows
Williams to pass

INT TENT - CONTINUOUS

MUSIC and SINGING louder than ever Everyone is swaying
singing at full throttle

We don’t see the stage but the fixed stares of the Men and
the Hostesses tell us the act has progressed to some new
level

Williams and Sutherland come in past the Doorman head
towards their old seats both within a bubble of solemnity

They squeeze down their row past irritated Men
Hostess 1 and Hostess 2 still mouthing the words of the song

partly out of duty partly from a wish to numb themselves as
Williams and Sutherland regain their seats

Hostess 1 and Hostess 2 take their arms automatically not
without affection They don’t notice Williams’s and
Sutherland’s changed mood

The SINGING now feels overwhelming The crowd press in on
Williams and Sutherland jostling them

But none of the gaiety penetrates Williams’s or Sutherlands
bubble - Williams sits with eyes gazing into space

Sutherland still stares at Williams He suddenly becomes
freshly aware of their surroundings looks around at it with
a kind of terror

Then looks again at Williams

Williams is far away oblivious to everything around him

We MOVE OUT steadily to see Williams and Sutherland within
the audience isolated in their melancholy like men on a

small boat tossed by wild waves

DISSOLVE TO

EXT PICCADILLY AREA - ESTABLISHING - DAY

Bright summer sunshine Late morning Double-decker buses
well-heeled pedestrians

EXT STREET IN PICCADILLY - DAY

Williams looking without interest into the window of a smart
men’s shoe shop He’s wearing his new hat

He moves along aimlessly A VOICE calls out to him

MARGARET (0S)
Mr Williams Mr Williams

Williams turns slowly Margaret arrives at his side

MARGARET (CONTD)
Mr Williams It is you For a
moment then I was quite thrown I
mean by your
(looks him up and down)
-- by your new hat

WILLIAMS
Ah yes I lost my old one

MARGARET
It’s jolly nice But I do wonder
what they’ll make of it at the
office

WILLIAMS
I wonder
(suddenly smiles)
What would be your guess Miss
Harris Will my new hat go down
a storm there

MARGARET
Noah himself couldn’t get something
to go down a storm with that lot
Oh I shouldn’t be unkind Anyway
I don’t have to worry about them
any more Because I have a new job

WILLIAMS
Oh yes

MARGARET
That’s why I’m so pleased to see
you Oh I mean that’s not the
only reason I’m pleased you’re
well and going about your business
Because when you didn’t come in
yesterday and the day before

WILLIAMS
Yes I have rather gone to ground
But you see I had other Well
never mind Tell me more about your
new job Miss Harris

MARGARET
You know about it Mr Williams The
position with Lyons Corner House
It’s a branch just round the corner
from here An assistant manager’s
role at least once I get into the
swing of it I’m so excited
There’ll be so many more people so
much more air Oh I didn’t mean --

WILLIAMS
Quite all right County Hall isn’t
for everyone

They start to walk

MARGARET
Mr Williams I am glad I ran into
you I’1l be honest I have the
job but well it’s subject to the
reference And because you were
away

WILLIAMS
Ah I see I might have
inconvenienced you Surely Mr
Middleton could have --

MARGARET
We all think you have to write the
reference So I’ve been dying for
you to come back You won’t write a
mean one will you

WILLIAMS
(smiling)
I wouldn’t dream of it Miss
Harris But this is a little
awkward I hadn’t intended to
return to the office quite yet

MARGARET
Oh that’s no problem I have the
form here with me
(raises handbag)
I’ve been walking about with it

WILLIAMS
Then perhaps I could just sign it
here and you can fill it in how you
wish

MARGARET
Mr Williams This might be a joke
to you But I do need my reference
It’s required

They stop on the pavement Williams considers

WILLIAMS
Very well This is what I propose
Miss Harris I was just thinking of
treating myself to a light lunch at
Fortnum’s If you’d care to join
me I could write your reference
over lunch

MARGARET
Fortnum’s Really Are you sure

WILLIAMS
Why not It might make up for the
inconvenience I’ve caused you

MARGARET
But that’s so kind Mr Williams
Fortnum’s Is it this way

WILLIAMS
Fortnum’s is this way

INT FORTNUM AND MASON - SECOND FLOOR CAFE - DAY
Sun-filled room within the famous store

Williams and Margaret have a table overlooking Piccadilly A
Waiter is clearing away dishes from their lunch

Williams is writing on an official form

MARGARET
You know Mr Williams When I see
you like this bowed over your
paperwork I suddenly remember
youre the same person after all
The one at the head of our desk
every morning every afternoon for
the last sixteen months of my life
But I realise today you’re not
like that really

Williams looks up from his document

MARGARET (CONTD)
What I mean is There’s much more
to you Fortnum’s And your new
hat

Williams smiles touches the hat on the seat beside him

WILLIAMS
Now now I won’t write a more
favourable reference just because
you say things like that

MARGARET
Oh I’m not trying to butter you
up Mr Williams I just had you
wrong that’s all I’d never seen
you outside of that building So I
never suspected you could be so
Beat

WILLIAMS
(writing)
Go on Miss Harris

MARGARET
(apologetic)
Well so alive

WILLIAMS
(looks up)
Alive
MARGARET

Mr Williams If you promise I mean
really truly promise you won’t get
angry Ill tell you my secret
nickname for you

WILLIAMS
Very well I promise

MARGARET
Now remember You’re really not to
get cross And it’s not just you I
have nicknames for everyone No-one
knows them except me and Rosemary
My cousin with whom I share rooms

WILLIAMS
I see

MARGARET

For instance Mr Rusbridger’s
secret name is The Reverend
Because he’s always opening his
hands like this

(imitates)
Like he’s addressing his
congregation

Williams consider this nods

MARGARET (CONTD)
And Mr Hart I call him Saint
George Because he looks like he’s
expecting to see a dragon any
moment

She pulls a face to impersonate It does resemble Hart

Williams bursts out laughing He turns to the window goes
laughing Margaret pleased laughs and laughs

on
MARGARET (CONTD)
All right This time I’1ll give you
the nickname And you guess who it
is It’s someone on the fourth
floor Julius Caesar Who do you
think that is

WILLIAMS
Julius Caesar I suppose that would
be Mr Brown in accounts

MARGARET
Correct

They both laugh
They’re interrupted by the arrival of the Waiter
WAITER
Excuse me May I get you something

else A dessert Something from our
sweets trolley

WILLIAMS
Not for me But perhaps the young
lady might --

MARGARET

Oh yes please I’ve always wanted
one of those ice cream sundaes

WAITER
A Knickerbocker Glory miss

MARGARET
Oh yes With fruit and nuts Yes
please

Waiter nods leaves

MARGARET (CONTD)
Oh are you sure this is all right

WILLIAMS
Of course But Miss Harris You
havent come round to the main
point You were going to tell me
your name for me

The smile leaves Margaret’s face

MARGARET
Well It’s a silly name really
Perhaps I shan’t tell you after
all
WILLIAMS
Oh no You’ve come this far You
have to tell me

Margaret has become very tense

MARGARET
All right But remember your
promise Not to get angry
(beat)
Mr Zombie

WILLIAMS
(puzzled)
Mr what

MARGARET
Mr Zombie There was a film about

I can walk about

Williams bursts out laughing Margaret relieved laughs
The Waiter returns

WAITER

Margaret is delighted

MARGARET
Oh thank you

Williams shakes his head laughs again

WILLIAMS

Williams and Margaret both laugh
Across the room waiting to be seated
Miss Fry watching Williams and Margaret laughing together

She is holding her small dog (same as before) in her arms
its face close to hers

She stares - scandalised excited As Waiter approaches she

Oh Mr Williams I so wish you could

I was just about to say ‘Mr
Williams will be furious’ Id
better hurry just the same

Williams stops walking Margaret does too

WILLIAMS
It’s a splendid day And Id like
to see your Lyons Corner House
Miss Harris why don’t you take the
afternoon off

MARGARET
I can’t do that Mr Williams

WILLIAMS
Why not You’ve handed in your
notice You have your glowing
reference Why not enjoy the rest
of your day

MARGARET
Mr Williams Earlier I didn’t wish
to be Well I’11 ask it now Is
that what you’ve been doing I
mean skiving off People thought
you must be ill or something But
obviously you’re not

WILLIAMS
Look here’s my proposal Why don’t
you and I ‘skive off’ together
What difference would our absences
for an afternoon make to anything

MARGARET
It is very tempting Very
tempting But it does seem

very daring What would we do

INT OFFICE - TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON

Peter Middleton Hart Rusbridger at their usual places
around the table

The name plates ‘MR WILLIAMS’ and ‘MISS HARRIS’ mark vacant
places

Peter looks glumly across at the ‘MISS HARRIS’ sign lost in
thought Rusbridger notices

HART
One could easily find out her new
place of employment Mr Wakeling

Hart and Rusbridger laugh quietly not looking up Peter
smiles But he’s not pleased

PETER
It’s rather bad form really Even
if she is leaving I wouldn’t have
expected it of her

HART
I dare say she’1ll pop back Monday
(to Rusbridger)
Well we know it’s a Lyons Corner
House Narrows it down If Mr
Wakeling really wants to --

PETER
I don’t want to You’re all getting
quite the wrong end of the stick

RUSBRIDGER

Mr Middleton As Acting Head
wouldn’t you be able simply to look
it up

MIDDLETON
That would be highly irregular Mr
Rusbridger

RUSBRIDGER
What even if there may be far more
than curiosity at stake here

PETER
(now seriously annoyed)
Look really I do wish Mr Williams
would come back Things might go
back to being more orderly around
here

EXT WATERLOO STATION - APPROACH - DAY

Williams and Margaret have stopped on the pavement People
hurry past them and into the station the evening rush not
yet in full flow

WILLIAMS
(consulting watch)
Id better be on the 456 Or else
Ill find myself sharing the same
train as our dear colleagues

MARGARET
That would be awkward

They exchange a smile But Margaret now looks guilty

MARGARET (CONTD)
I do wonder if we haven’t been
very wicked

WILLIAMS
You’ve no need to worry about that
any more Miss Harris

(MORE )
WILLIAMS (CONTD)
You just keep your mind on your
Lyons Corner House

MARGARET
I will But I was thinking about
you

WILLIAMS
Oh don’t worry about me I hada
wonderful afternoon

MARGARET
(smiling)
So did I Thank you for treating
me I do hope it hasn’t been
terribly expensive and you don’t
awfully regret it when you get
home

WILLIAMS

I’1l make a promise now that I
won’t Miss Harris I did wish to
saying something to you

(beat)
Your time with us It might not
always have been so exciting But I
hope you won’t judge them too
harshly Judge us I should say We
do what we can

MARGARET
Yes of course I never meant --

WILLIAMS

Look at the crowd here

(indicates)
Came through the war so much still
to rebuild so many dreams
Sometimes it can get too much Too
much to place on the shoulders of
ordinary decent chaps like those up
in that office

MARGARET
Yes I shan’t think wickedly
about them any more

WILLIAMS
Well Miss Harris Goodbye

MARGARET
Goodbye Mr Williams

Williams goes into the crowd Margaret watches concern on
her face

upset looking towards the kitchen doorway - through which we
see

Fiona in an apron moving about busily
Behind Michael the table set for the evening meal

despite emotion)
The woman is a public nuisance A
prize mischief maker

Fiona brushes past him places dish on the table throws
Michael a curt look

Michael shakes his head in exasperation

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Nothing she likes better than --

Fiona spins round finger to lips gestures with her head

Williams goes on staring silently at his reflection

INT WILLIAMS FAMILY HOUSE - DINING ROOMKITCHEN -

Michael as before in centre of room looks more upset than
ever

He can now barely keep down his voice He’s addressing Fiona
through doorway to the kitchen

MICHAEL
It’s outrageous At his age
(beat)
And as for this this girl
Barely a woman Certainly not a
lady --

Fiona emerging from kitchen pushes past with another pot
gestures warningly upstairs with her eyes

FIONA
(sotto)
It does all fit The calls from his
office The savings You simply
must speak to him You should have
done so long ago About everything

MICHAEL

I’1l speak to him all right With
pleasure I’1l1 speak to him

newspaper

Michael braces himself raises newspaper till it hides most
of his face

Fiona comes to the kitchen doorway waits
Williams enters

(nonchalantly)
Oh here you are Father
She retreats into the kitchen OUT OF VIEW Williams looks
around looks at Michael hidden behind the newspaper He
sits

Fiona comes in with a dish places it at centre of the table

WILLIAMS
Ah Smells wonderful

FIONA

Michael lowers the paper looks around feigning distraction

MICHAEL

Williams looks from Fiona to Michael shakes head in fatherly
fashion

WILLIAMS
(believing he’s
peacemaking)

Shepherds Pie

FIONA
Yes And decent mince too

WILLIAMS
How splendid

Fiona takes Williams’s plate serves food places it back in
front of him

Williams gazes at it his thoughts now far away realising he
will not bring up anything significant at this present moment
- defeat

FIONA
You might look a little more
grateful Father

WILLIAMS
What Oh excuse me Miles away

Fiona serves Michael staring daggers at him But she too
knows now the moment has passed and Michael won’t say
anything

MICHAEL
Thank you darling

Fiona’s frustration boils over

FIONA
(shockingly loud)
There was a time - when what one
did in London - stayed in London
But these days - half of this
street works in London

She glares in turn from Michael to Williams back to Michael
Michael looks down at his food

Williams still believing his role is solely that of
peacemaker nods wisely

Peter holding a folder purposefully striding up the stairs
His face lights up with recognition at

Mrs Smith Mrs McMasters and Mrs Porter descending the
staircase towards him

PETER
Ladies How lovely to see you

They all pause on the stairs

MRS SMITH
How do you do Mr Wakeling

PETER
And are you all well Had a trifle
more luck today perhaps

Mrs Smith stares at him blankly

MRS MCMASTERS
Another blimming day going all over
this building Like we had no
husbands or kiddies to see to
(MORE)

MRS MCMASTERS (CONTD)
Downright disgrace if you ask me
the way they treat us

PETER
Oh dear I’m so sorry I really
thought that by now --

MRS SMITH
(quietly explosive)
We want someone sir We don’t care
who We want someone to take

charge
PETER
(rocked back)
Oh But really You must
appreciate Mrs Smith The way
these things work it’s never quite
so simple as one would
He trails off conscious of the hollowness of his words
Beat
MRS SMITH
We wish you a pleasant afternoon
Mr Wakeling It was nice to see you

She leads Mrs McMasters and Mrs Porter down the staircase

Peter remains frozen where he’s standing gazing after them
disappointed by his own response to the encounter

Then he starts up the stairs again thoughtful

EXT ST JAMES PARK - DAY

Sunshine Quiet Williams sits alone on a bench gazing at
surroundings

To a casual observer he may look carefree But we can see
that his tranquillity is willed

A sudden stab of physical pain He grimaces stiffens

With effort he reimposes his ‘relaxed’ posture But now his
expression betrays troubled preoccupation

Annoyed with his intruding thoughts he rises looks around
for something to distract him

His gaze finds nothing

He takes a deep breath as if it will bring him fresh
resolve Walks away from the bench purposefully
INT LYONS CORNER HOUSE - DAY
A large smart Art Deco room offering food tea and sanctuary
to white-collar workers and genteel middle-class customers at
‘reasonable’ prices Potted palms Chamber orchestra

Late afternoon The place is busy

Margaret in waitress uniform hurries between tables She
appears to be in danger of being overwhelmed

As she hurries past a table

PRIM LADY
Miss Miss This sausage roll is
cold

MARGARET

I’m so sorry Shall I bring you --

PERSISTENT MAN
Miss Miss

MARGARET
(turning to his table)
One moment sir I’m sorry

PRIM LADY
New here aren’t you Not quite
found your feet yet

MARGARET
Would you care for something else
madam Some more tea

PRIM LADY
I shall think about it Then I
shall let you know

Something catches Margaret’s eye across the room

Williams queuing behind two other Customers at the ‘PLEASE
WAIT TO BE SEATED’ notice at the front He is searching the
room with his gaze

Concern crosses Margaret’s face

PERSISTENT MAN
Miss Miss

PRIM LADY
Don’t worry my dear I’ve seen a
lot of girls come and go I can
tell you’1ll do fine here Trust me

But Margaret is preoccupied

Williams has now spotted her He waves Margaret smiles but
shakes head slowly at him disapprovingly

PERSISTENT MAN
Miss

MARGARET
Yes sir

INT LYONS CORNER HOUSE - A FEW MOMENTS LATER
HEAD WAITER leading Williams across the room to his table

As he sits down Williams is saying something pointing
towards Margaret on the other side of the room

Head Waiter’s gaze falls on Margaret He signals for her to
come over to Williams’s table

Margaret begins to cross the room while the Head Waiter
having left Williams comes towards her As they cross

HEAD WAITER
Make it snappy please It’s
getting very busy

MARGARET
Yes Mr Adams

Margaret approaches Williams’s table

MARGARET (CONTD)
Mr Williams You’re skiving again
I’m disappointed

WILLIAMS
And Miss Harris I’m disappointed
to find you well into your third
week here still working as a
waitress It was an assistant
manager’s post you accepted

MARGARET
I hope to be given greater
responsibilities in good time

WILLIAMS
If you wish I might have a word
with your --

MARGARET
That won’t be necessary thank you
And I am disappointed to find you
havent returned to the office You
did say last time that you would

WILLIAMS
As it happens I was just now
thinking about that After all
it’s not as though I’ve discovered
a wealth of other ways to --

MARGARET
(looking over shoulder)
Oh look I’m sorry It’s so very
busy--

WILLIAMS
Of course I’ll let you go But I
did wonder when your present shift
ended

MARGARET
And why would you mind about that
Mr Williams

WILLIAMS
Why Well for one thing because
they’re showing ‘I Was A Male War
Bride’ at the pictures It has Cary
Grant in it I wondered if you’d
care to come along

MARGARET
Mr Williams I refuse to encourage
you any further with this skiving
We did say last Tuesday that would
be the last time You really must
return to the office What must
they all be thinking there

WILLIAMS
Ah but today is my pictures day
And I was merely wishing for a
companion Oh well

(smiles charmingly)

Cary Grant Miss Harris I
understood you’re quite fond of
him

Margaret goes on looking at him Then smiles

INT CINEMA - DAY

Williams and Margaret watching the screen A nearly full
house We hear SOUND from ‘I WAS A MALE WAR BRIDE’

A FUNNY LINE OF DIALOGUE makes Williams Margaret the
Audience Members all laugh loudly together

Margaret enjoying herself keeps watching poised to laugh
again

But now a change comes over Williams’s face His gaze remains
on the screen but his thoughts have gone elsewhere

Another FUNNY LINE
Margaret Audience Members laugh loudly

Williams doesn’t laugh his gaze now melancholy Margaret
doesn’t notice

A third FUNNY LINE

Margaret laughs but this time notices Williams isn’t
laughing looks at him with concern

Williams keeps staring at the screen thoughts far away

EXT LONDON WEST END - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

Theatres lights lit doorways

INT WEST END AMUSEMENT ARCADE - NIGHT

Garish lights One-armed bandits other machines Reminiscent
of the seaside arcade but the atmosphere here lacks the
seafront’s innocence Several Customers in the background
each solitary verge on the sleazy

Williams is bending over a machine that we do not see yet We
hear its TINNY MUSIC

Margaret comes INTO VIEW behind him She glances at Williams
then looks uncomfortably around at their surroundings

MARGARET
Mr Williams It’s time I was going
home My cousin will be getting
concerned

WILLIAMS
(concentrating)
Yes of course But look at this
(MORE)
WILLIAMS (CONTD)
It may seem easy But I assure you
it isn’t

Margaret without enthusiasm looks over his shoulder

CLOSE SHOT - CRANE GAME CABINET A heap of small prizes The

star prize a fluffy white toy rabbit

The crane hovers over the rabbit comes lower clutches it

But when Williams raises the crane the rabbit slips out

drops back onto the heap of prizes

The light in the cabinet cuts out TINNY MUSIC STOPS

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
(straightening)
Oh It’s so difficult

MARGARET
Mr Williams I really must --

WILLIAMS
Of course But before you go Miss
Harris wouldn’t you like to have a
try yourself I have this feeling
you see that you’d be rather good
at this We’re after that rabbit
It’s what everyone wants

Margaret hesitates looks uneasily again around the

MARGARET
Very well Just the once Then I
must be going

WILLIAMS
Jolly good Now You have to take a
good proper grip on these --

MARGARET
I can see what to do thank you

arcade

Margaret takes the controls without enthusiasm Williams puts

in coins

TINNY MUSIC STARTS The cabinet lights up again

CLOSE SHOT Margaret manipulates the crane till it is

hovering over the rabbit

WILLIAMS (0S)
I did warn you Miss Harris It’s
not nearly as

He trails off because Margaret has successfully caught the
rabbit in the crane’s jaws

WILLIAMS (0S) (CONTD)
I say

The crane picks up the rabbit raises it off the heap

WILLIAMS (0S) (CONTD)
Now be very careful And hurry
Miss Harris They don’t give you
long

The crane holds the rabbit swings it over to the mouth of
the chute drops it A HOOTING SOUND to signal a win

WILLIAMS (CONTD)

(too loud)
Well done Well done Miss Harris
I might have known it I might have
known you could do it

Margaret looks around self-consciously Other Customers
glance towards them return to their own games

Margaret extracts rabbit from the hatch looks at it For the
first time she looks gleeful

MARGARET
Oh It’s rather sweet
WILLIAMS
Bravo Miss Harris
MARGARET
Now I really must --
WILLIAMS
Of course I’1ll walk you to your

bus stop
He makes an ushering gesture towards the exit Margaret
starts to stride towards it eager to leave Williams
follows beaming contentedly
WILLIAMS (CONTD)
Bravo Miss Harris Bravo

EXT LONDON WEST END - STREET - NIGHT

Brightly lit theatre fronts Illuminated windows of
restaurants and cafes Taxicabs Pedestrians buses

Williams and Margaret walking

She is setting a purposeful pace They are not talking
Williams registers another surge of pain in his abdomen He
grimaces Margaret has not noticed

Suddenly Williams stops in the middle of the pavement

WILLIAMS
Miss Harris

Margaret stops comes back the few paces to him

MARGARET
What is it Mr Williams

WILLIAMS

I know I’ve already taken more of
your evening than I should But I
did wonder if youd If youd
join me for just one drink A few
minutes no more Because you
see

(reserve suddenly

crumbling)
- I don’t feel quite able to go
home just yet

Margaret looks at him with surprise She’s uneasy but she
nods

MARGARET
Very well

INT PUB - INNER ROOM - NIGHT

Williams and Margaret are alone in this section of the pub
Their table is large enough for six Margaret sits ona
banquette Williams sits at right-angles to her on a wooden
chair A lime cordial and an untouched pint of beer on the
table

They sit in uncomfortable silence
Visible through an arch the pub’s bar and Main Room Here

six wholesome YOUNG PEOPLE - three couples all Margarets
age - are talking and laughing cheerfully

Margaret glances towards them winds the clockwork mechanism
of the fluffy toy rabbit

A BURST OF LAUGHTER from the Young People

Margaret looks at them enviously sets the rabbit hopping
across the table surface

Before the rabbit can hop off the table edge Margaret
reaches over brings it back to her

She sets it hopping on its journey once more But this time
the rabbit slows comes to a halt half-way across

Williams and Margaret stare at the rabbit More LAUGHTER from
the Young People

Margaret glances again towards them

WILLIAMS
I’m sure youll find things more
conducive once you’re given your
proper duties --

MARGARET
Mr Williams This isn’t very nice
really is it

Williams looks at her

MARGARET (CONTD)
I know it’s quite innocent I’m not
implying anything But you are
well much older than me and
Well frankly Mr Williams Someone
might suppose you were becoming
infatuated

She turns away from him Williams looks at her with outrage
but it melts away quickly He looks sheepish defeated

WILLIAMS
Infatuated I suppose in a way I
am
(beat)
But not quite as some might
suppose

Another BURST OF LAUGHTER Williams and Margaret look again
towards the Main Room

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
Miss Harris I wonder if I may
confide in you There’s something I
haven’t really told anyone Not
even my son

MARGARET
Well if you really think --

WILLIAMS
It’s quite a bore really But the
fact is

Suddenly he’s overcome with emotion unable to speak For
two beats he struggles to hold back tears

Margaret stares astonished She reaches out a hand
But Williams has already recovered his customary composure

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
The fact is I’m not expected to
live much longer It appears I have
a cancer Here somewhere --

MARGARET
Oh

She raises her hands to her mouth stares at him

WILLIAMS

(now calm almost

humorous )
I’ve another seven months A little
longer if I’m fortunate I’m sorry
I really didn’t wish to distress
you But you see I wanted you to
know because well because of this
infatuation as you called it
(beat)
You see after receiving my news I
took to looking around myself a
little At that office that life
And I realized how since you
arrived how very different it’s
been I confess I did at times
worry if your attitude was well
appropriate But then I came to
appreciate you Not simply for your
youth There was some other
quality Your appetite for life
The way you always make everything
jolly and gay Even whilst working
there with us And that day I saw
you in Piccadilly I thought look
at her look at Miss Harris If
only to be alive like that even
for one day And I suppose I hoped
you might show me Teach me how to
be like you --

MARGARET
I have no such special quality I’m
just an ordinary person With my
fair share of worries and
resentments I try to keep
cheerful it’s true But all too
often --

WILLIAMS
If only for a day And I started to
think to remember That perhaps
once long ago I too may have
been almost like you are now

MARGARET
Mr Williams really Your son
Why haven’t you told your son
Surely he’s the one you must turn
to now --

WILLIAMS

Michael

(smiles distantly)
Oh I do think the world of
Michael However he’s now he has
his own life to lead His own
concerns That’s as it should be I
suppose that’s why I’ve had to
pester you Miss Harris But you’re
correct I’m behaving like an old
fool Please forgive me I should
find some other way to --

The Young People in the Main Room start SINGING ‘Happy
Birthday’

Margaret looks at them now resentful for this inappropriate
gaiety

But Williams turns to regard them with gentle pleasure
conducting the singing lightly with his fingers

The Happy Birthday chorus ENDS in APPLAUSE

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
A birthday How pleasant

(beat)
Yes I’m sure of it Miss Harris I
wasn’t always this what was it

Your name for me

MARGARET
(close to tears)
Mr Zombie

WILLIAMS
Ah yes Mr Zombie No I wasn’t
always When my wife was with me
for instance Then later all the
time Michael was growing up I
wasn’t Mr Zombie at all then
Perhaps I didn’t much resemble you
But in my own way --

MARGARET
Is there really nothing they can
do
WILLIAMS
(ignoring)

When I was your age Miss Harris
no even younger from when I was
this high What I wanted was to be
a gentleman Nothing grand Just a
rank and file sort of gentleman I
used to see them in the mornings
all lined up at the railway station
whenever I went there with my
mother Their suits and hats
Waiting on the platform to go into
London A gentleman like that
That’s what I longed to be one day

Again his reserve crumbles He struggles not to be
overwhelmed by frustration anger sadness Then he recovers
shakes his head

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
How did it happen I fancy it crept
up on me The days proceeding one
after the next Each with their
little burdens and defeats Small
wonder I didn’t notice what I was
becoming But then I looked at you
and remembered What it was like
to be alive like that --

Williams stares at Margaret for a moment

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
Miss Harris I wonder if you ever
stop on your way home and watch the
children playing In the street in
the yard Balls cowboys whatever
Always so full of life And when
the time comes and their mothers
call them in they’re often
reluctant get a little contrary
Well that’s as it should be Far
better that than be the child you
occasionally see sitting by
himself in a corner Not taking
part not happy not unhappy
Merely waiting for his mother to
call him in Now I’ve become rather
afraid I might end up like that
little fellow and and I so very
much wish not to do so

(MORE)

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
When the time comes when my Maker
calls me I wish at least for him
to find me living The thing is
I don’t see how to change it now
I’ve tried my best these last few
weeks Even went to the seaside

Suddenly he’s stopped by an idea opening within him Beat

Williams starts to laugh Secretively at first then his
laughter seems to shake his whole being - a laughter filled
with relief revelation and the appreciation of having
missed something staring one in the face

Margaret looks at him alarmed puzzled

WILLIAMS (CONTD)
(another short laugh)

Perhaps it’s not too late after all

for Mr Zombie

He picks up the rabbit holds it to his heart

MARGARET
Mr Williams --

WILLIAMS
Miss Harris I hope you’re able to
forgive me Forgive me for
everything But I’ve kept you for
too long Let’s get you to your bus
stop

Williams rises with urgency reaches for his fedora the
rabbit still clutched to his chest

Margaret rises too looks at the rabbit

MARGARET
Mr Williams are you sure you’re
all right Oh I’m so sorry What I
mean is --

WILLIAMS
Never better Miss Harris But we
must hurry Your cousin will be
getting anxious

He ushers Margaret out before him an impatience as well as
a new energy in his manner

Margaret pauses to look round at him but he hurries her on

As they pass the cheerful Young People in the Main Room
Williams gives them a smiling nod waves the rabbit at them
triumphantly

INT OFFICE - TABLE - DAY

There’s a physical fragility about him but he’s lit up by an
inner energy

He breaks down one of his towers Papers cascade across the
table

WILLIAMS
Good morning everyone Mr Hart

(MORE)

SIR JAMES (CONTD)
But the way those ladies have been
kicking up Even complained to
their MP

HART
Yes a bit steep

SIR JAMES
And the irony is in the end it
does a disservice to the memory of
our dear departed friend Such a
self-effacing fellow If he were
here he’d be the first to protest

MIDDLETON
Quite

Peter’s attention has wandered from Sir James He is looking
over to the ladies - and Margaret

PETER (CONTD)
Saw you talking to the ladies

MARGARET
Yes They’re very distraught They
were so fond of him

PETER
You know I think those ladies may
have a point

PETER (CONTD)
Mr Williams didn’t even get a
mention at the official opening

MARGARET
I quite agree

PETER
Look Miss Harris Well I was just
wondering

MARGARET
What were you wondering Mr
Wakeling

For a beat they go on smiling at each other their pleasure
in being together now barely contained

Margaret smiles but before she can reply something catches
her eye Her expression darkens

Michael comes towards them holding up a letter-size
envelope He glances quickly at Margaret looks away

MICHAEL
Mr Wakeling

PETER
Mr Williams

MICHAEL
I’m sorry to raise this here But I
thought it best I give this to you
right away

Michael holds out the envelope to Peter still avoiding
looking at Margaret

It was amongst my father’s things
Quite prominent He’s marked it
‘Private and Confidential’

PETER
So he has

Suddenly Michael turns to face Margaret
MICHAEL

introduced I know But I wonder if

we might have a word In private

hard for you

MICHAEL

this sort of thing once before

MARGARET

when he left I said to myself

well Sorry I’m boring you

MARGARET

Now Margaret looks away

MARGARET
I really don’t know what to say

Because if he knew And he told
youYou see what I mean
(laughs)
Why wouldn’t he tell me

Margaret turns back to Michael Her expression makes clear
she did know

Michael’s eyes well up He attempts to wipe tears then turns
away sobbing

MARGARET
Oh dear Perhaps--

His sobs reach a climax then come under control

MICHAEL
If he’d just told me I’d never
have let him leave us like that In

Peter surreptitiously takes from his jacket the envelope
unseals it takes out letter Several handwritten pages

He keeps the letter held low so as not to draw attention
Reads

WILLIAMS (VO)
My dear Mr Wakeling I hope you
will forgive what by this stage
might appear an intrusion on my
part But I did wish to draw your
attention to the on-going issues
regarding the maintenance schedule
for the recently completed
playground at Chester Street

Peter disappointed shakes his head He glances up checks
the others haven’t noticed goes on reading

WILLIAMS (VO)
An approved timetable has been
filed with Parks and Recreation
together with a completed D48 and
you will already be aware that day-
to-day responsibilities have been
delegated to Allsop and Dundee a

passage from further in the letter reads

WILLIAMS (VO)
- oversight is especially
required concerning the quality of
paints used on all exposed metal
surfaces of the children’s play
apparatus --

RUSBRIDGER
Any of you chaps get to talk to Mrs
Smith Or any of the other ladies

Peter places the letter on the seat beside him out of the
others’ view

MIDDLETON
You know one appreciates them
sticking up for the old man’s
memory But theyve quite convinced
themselves Mr Williams built that
playground entirely by himself

RUSBRIDGER
Parks did get more credit than they
deserved

HART
That’s because they’re called
Parks

RUSBRIDGER
Sir James certainly got his share
of the credit Made certain of
that

Uncomfortable silence

Peter takes the letter in hand again goes to a random
passage reads

WILLIAMS (VO)
- successive layers of bitumen
can never be a substitute for
necessary repair to the hut’s
roof

Peter shakes his head

MIDDLETON
Sir James was quite crucial as far
as that playground’s concerned

RUSBRIDGER
I suppose he was

Middleton Hart and Rusbridger go back to staring quietly out
of their windows

Peter looks around at the others They remain lost in
thought gazing out at the passing view

PETER
You know I cant help thinking I
didn’t know Mr Williams the way you
all did But it does seem to me

RUSBRIDGER
That he changed

Yes

Rain pouring down

Williams in coat and fedora stands right at the edge of the
sheltered area gazing out at the wasteground before him - a
bomb site unattended since the war One end flooded by
stagnant water now rippled by falling rain

The wasteground is overlooked by council houses Their back
yards abut the wasteground

Behind Williams Huddled to one side Peter Middleton Hart

Women

Everyone is watching Williams - Peter with interest Mrs
Smith Mrs McMasters and the Local Women with tension

William’s gaze moving from one point to another
Drops fall on Middleton’s shoulder He moves to one side

Williams raises a hand absentmindedly in the air steps out
from under the bridge strides onto the wasteground

Immediately he’s ankle-deep in dirty water The rain pours
down on him He keeps walking

The others watch from the underpass astonished Suddenly Mrs
McMasters hurries out after Williams opening an umbrella as
she does so and comes to stand next to him holds umbrella
over him

Williams turns to her gestures to her to return But Mrs
McMasters keeps holding the umbrella over him - revealing a
steely determined side of her previously hidden by her comic
demeanour

Something else in the wasteground catches Williams’s notice
He strides towards it the water deepening around his ankles

Mrs McMasters follows him determinedly keeping the umbrella
over him neglecting herself

TALBOT

your hands straight away

TALBOT

like that Look don’t worry I’1l
see it gets done Then we’ll send
it down to you

Williams points to an empty chair right beside the Furiously

Williams sits The Furiously Typing Secretary pauses for a
second then resumes typing

Two DISTINGUISHED GENTS are in the armchairs reading
newspapers smoking They totally ignore the business going
on at Sir James’s desk

Williams and Middleton sit across from him on the edge of

Williams

SIR JAMES
So you see For all these reasons
this isn’t something we can
contemplate for the foreseeable
future I’m sorry I genuinely
regret it

Sir James rises obliging Williams and Middleton to rise
also

SIR JAMES (CONTD)
I’m not saying it isn’t a jolly
good idea It is I can see what
this would bring to the
neighbourhood And the site is a
disgrace Unfortunately just now
we have even more urgent
priorities Well Thank you for
coming to see me

Sir James shakes hands quickly with them both moves over to
join the Distinguished Gents by the fire

Williams and Middleton cross the floor towards the door
Middleton has his hand on the door when Williams turns

DISTINGUISHED GENT 1
They’re considering Anderson For
the new editor’s post at Punch
Don’t fancy that do you

SIR JAMES
Wouldn’t be quite right Man’s
obsessed with the ballet

DISTINGUISHED GENT 1
That’s not entirely fair Anderson
also cares passionately about
detective fiction and horses

DISTINGUISHED GENT 2
Punch isn’t what it used to be Not
amusing enough

They now become aware that Williams is not only still in the
room but has come right up to them Middleton astonished
remains at the door hand on knob

Sir James looks at Williams puzzled

WILLIAMS
Sir James Please excuse me But I
beg you to reconsider

Sir James taken aback is lost for words

would leave the application open
for one more week What harm can
that do

MIDDLETON

RUSBRIDGER
Those ladies may have a point
MIDDLETON
Yes But we all put our shoulders
to it
RUSBRIDGER

Yes but There’s no denying the
old man did push it

PETER
Could it be he knew That he didnt

galvanise a person

But he didn’t know His son was
very clear on that

urgency in a situation like that

PETER
Would we

MIDDLETON
Surely it’s a natural reaction

PETER
I don’t think everyone we here
even would necessarily have
responded in quite the way Mr
Williams did

Suddenly Williams drops the sheet wobbles sways Peter
stops him falling

Peter helps Williams over to the edge of the work area onto
the abutting back yard of one of the houses

Two Local Women hurry to help Williams into a garden chair
fuss over him as Peter looks on with concern

Then Williams looks up smiles uncertainly tries to stand
up

Woman 1 pushes him back into the chair keeps her hands
protectively on his shoulders while Woman 2 kneels before
him checks him out

Now Woman 3 comes hurrying out of a nearby house with a mug
of water passes it to Woman 2 who offers it to Williams He
smiles reassuringly

Look here everyone If I may speak
as his successor - and I don’t
think I’m getting ahead of myself
it’s all but official now - let me
propose we all make a pledge here

Peters is dying to read more of Williams’s letter but
there’s nothing for it He tucks it away into his jacket

Let’s pledge to learn from his
example This lesson he set before
us Let’s vow never again to shy
away from our responsibilities
Never again to push things under
the carpet --

Or upstairs I’m not saying we
don’t already do a jolly good job

suspiciously looks over the railings at the playground
below

POLICE CONSTABLE
Evening sir

PETER
Good evening officer

POLICE CONSTABLE
Everything all right

PETER
Yes I just wanted to see this
playground again
(beat)
I played a small part only a small
part mind you in bringing it into
being I work at the LCC

They both look down at the playground

POLICE CONSTABLE
Is that so sir Well then the
people here have a lot to thank you
for

PETER
Oh I didn’t do much
(smiles)
The man who did though passed away
this winter
(beat)
He was my boss Mr Williams

POLICE CONSTABLE
Mr Williams Yes
(beat)
Hell be remembered around here
with respect and affection if I
May say so

The Police Constable continues to gaze down at the
playground Something in his manner has changed Emotion
crosses the face beneath the helmet

Peter regards him with new interest

PETER
If this is your regular beat then
perhaps you knew him He was here a
great deal last year

The Police Constable remains silent goes on staring down at
playground Then

POLICE CONSTABLE
If you was his friend sir Then
perhaps you won’t mind my telling
you this Station sergeant says I’m
being foolish But it stays on my
mind If you was his friend worked

with him If you wouldnt mind
sir
PETER
(surprised)
No No not at all officer
Please

POLICE CONSTABLE
I never actually had the honour of
meeting your Mr Williams
personally he was always that
busy Closest I came sir was the
night he passed away

PETER
You saw him that night

POLICE CONSTABLE
It was fully reported sir

PETER
(knowingly)
Ah

POLICE CONSTABLE

Yes sir I was possibly the last
person to see Mr Williams alive I
wasn’t up here I was down there

(indicates)
Chester Street It was nine thirty-
five The snow had started by then
Coming on quite heavy I went over
because I heard the singing That’s
what drew me sir

FLASHBACK - EXT CHESTER STREET PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
(FEBRUARY )

Snow falling A VOICE SINGING (0S) softly slowly

The Police Constable comes up to the railings of the
playground

We are now on the same level as the playground

Its three street-lamps illuminate the falling snow - a
dusting of snow on the ground and on the play equipment

The centrepiece of the playground is a frame holding three
swings side by side

Williams in winter coat scarf and fedora is swinging
gently on the middle swing He is singing softly to himself
no-one else in the playground

The Police Constable watches from the railings Thinks about
entering playground hesitates

We MOVE SLOWLY towards Williams on the swing his face hidden
under his hat snow falling steadily around him

His SINGING is heard more clearly as we approach

WILLIAMS

(singing sotto)
‘ Rowan tree oh Rowan Tree
Thou’lt aye be dear to me
Entwin’d thou art wi’ mony ties
O’ hame and infancy
Thy leaves were aye the first
o’spring
Thy flow’rs the summer’s pride
There was nae such a bonny tree
In a’ the countryside’

POLICE CONSTABLE (VO)
I recognised Mr Williams sir So I
knew he had a right to be there
That he wasn’t meaning any harm

WILLIAMS

(singing sotto)
‘How fair wert thou in summer
time
Wi’ a’ thy clusters white
How rich and gay thy autumn dress
Wi’ berries red and bright
On thy fair stem were many names
Which now nae mair I see
But they’re engraven on my heart
Forgot they ne’ever can be’

POLICE CONSTABLE (V0O)
And I thought maybe he’d had a
drop to drink and he was just
For his own good sir I should
have persuaded him Told him to get
out the cold That’s what’s been on
my mind sir If only I

We now see Williams’s face His expression is illuminated by
an inner triumph A glowing contentment that seems to warm
the snow falling over him

WILLIAMS

(singing sotto)
‘ We sat aneath thy spreading
shade
The bairnies round thee ran
They pu’d thy bonny berries red
And necklaces they strang
My mother Oh I see her still
She smiled our sports to see
Wi’ little Jeanie on her lap
And Jamie at her knee

POLICE CONSTABLE (VO)
But you see sir He looked so
so happy Happy as I ever saw a
man And it felt a shame sir to
disturb him I imagined in time
he’d just come off that swing and
go home

EXT STREET OVERLOOKING PLAYGROUND - EVENING

As before Peter and Police Constable looking down on the
playground
The Police Constable accepts these words like communion

Beat

POLICE CONSTABLE
It was negligent of me sir If Id
persuaded him to get out the
snow

PETER
No officer I think it was for the
best Mr Williams had a terminal
illness and it was right that
you allowed him that moment

PETER (CONTD)
And I believe you were quite right
He was happy when you saw him
Perhaps as happy as hed ever been
in his life So I wouldnt worry
yourself any more officer

POLICE CONSTABLE
That does lift a cloud What you
say there Thank you sir

Peter touches the Police Constable gently on the arm

PETER
Good night officer

POLICE CONSTABLE
Good night sir

Peter walks away down the street

Then Three Children aged 8 or 9 come running into the
playground excited

Two run towards the swings begin swinging

The other Child clambers eagerly up the climbing frame

EXT PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

At ground level

The Police Constable watches him then glances back down at
the empty playground below lit by the lamps silent

NOISE of PLAYING CHILDREN becomes audible rises in volume
The street lamps dim and go out to be replaced by sunlight

The playground busy with children on a summer’s afternoon

A YOUNG MOTHER emerges from one of the council houses whose
back yards abut the playground She looks cross

YOUNG MOTHER
(calling)
Jennifer Steven I’m not going to
tell you again

Jennifer and Steven 6 and 9 come off the swings hurry
towards the Young Mother

The other CHILDREN PLAY on NOISILY A child is CRYING OS
The playground is clearly a resounding success

A Boy jumps off the middle of the three swings in the frame
Now all three swings are empty

The middle swing for the moment continues to swing by
itself

FADE TO BLACK

The End
