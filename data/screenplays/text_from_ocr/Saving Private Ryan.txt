FADE IN
EXT ST LAURENT MILITARY GRAVEYARD - LATE SPRING - Day
As we follow a hunched-over OLD MAN with white tuffy nair

High hedgerows prevent any other view except to guide he old
man who now follows the pathway

Then suddenly the elderly man stops cold as if hitting an
invisible brick wall His breathing quickens as his legs
fold up beneath him and he falls to his knees his eyes
riveted in front of him

CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to witness what stopped the elderly man
in his tracks and punched the wind out of his lungs

A LANDSCAPE OF WHITE CROSSES WITH THE OCCASIONAL STAR OF DAVID
So vast that it spans your peripheral vision and carries your
eve acres and acres up a gently rolling hill It looks like
the entire world died and was buried up here

OUR FIRST CLOSE UP - ELDERLY MAN

He could be anyones father or grandfather Nothing very
memorable about this face except those eyesthat have seen
too muchand perhaps for the first time in fifty-five
years are suddenly seeing it all again

CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN ON THAT FACETHOSE EYES

ELDERLY MANS POV

A geometricaliy straight line of crosses as far as the eye
can just about see

SMASE MATCH CUT TO
A LESS THAN PERFECT LINE OF BELGIAN GATES

Beach obstacles made of steel crossbars welded into an
X-shapealmost as far as the eye can see

Its very quiet here-- too quiet
SUPER TITLE

OMAHA BEACH 0615 HOURS

THE ALLIED ARMADA
Is nothing iess than stunning in scope Almost as many
battleships cruisers minesweepers destroyers troop
carriers aS there were graves at St Laurent

THE HIGGINS BOATS

Two hundred of them head for shore in the first
wave--uncglamorous utilitarian flat-bottomed landing craft
Each hoids a platoon of thirty men (or twelve plus a jeep)
EXT ONE OF THE HIGGINS BOATS - DAWN

Madness The flat bow of the boat crashes into the swell
sending up squalis of spray

IN THE HIGGINS BOAT
Water pouring in with every swell Men puking moaning
Smashing and tumbling into each other Bailing with their

helmets Swallowing sea sickness pills

MELLISH a Jewish kid from Yonkers sees CAPARZO handing out
the sea-sickness pills

MELLISH
Give me some more of those

Mellish grabs the whole bunch from Caparzo and swallows them
all

CAPARZO
Thats my entire wartime supply you
idiot

MELLISH

ty

What aifference does it make This is
probabiy the last boat ride we’re ever
gonna—

A FIFTEEN INCH NAVAL SHELL STREAKS

Over their heads LIFTING THE HIGGINS BOAT ALMOST OUT OF THE
WATER Sucking the air from the mens lungs It slams into
the unseen shore ahead

THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE MEN

Grim They know theyre close Many of them are praying
Meliish turns green and suddenly explosively vomits

Caparzo glances about makes sure no one’s looking and
patiently kneels down and picks up all his slimy used
seasickness pills from the puddle at his feet
CUT TO A HAND
As it quivers
PAN UP TO CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER

Late thirties by far the oldest man on the craft Miller
glances around to see that none of the men have noticed He
stares at his nand as if it belongs to someone else It stops
shaking

SERGEANT MICHAEL HORVATH (SARGE) appears at his side tactful
enough not to notice He gestures to the men

SARGE
Christ look at ‘em Most of ‘em are farm
boys never even seen the Goddamn ocean

A young soldier DELANCEY tries to get a peek over the
gunwale at the Higgins Boat directly off their port side

DELANCEYS POV

At that exact moment that landing craft hits a mine

A HUGE EXPLOSION

Of fuel fire metal and human parts Delancey falls back
and you know hes going to lose it as the debris from the
exploded companion boat rains down on all the men Flaming
oil and body parts actual hands arms legs feet still in

their boots cascade over everyone and everything

The men stop bailing using the water to put out the flames
All of them screaming out their reactions

DELANCEY
Captain are we ail gonna die

LIEUTENANT BRIGGS turns responding to Delancey

BRIGGS
Hell no Delancey Two-thirds tops

DELANCEY
-Oh Jesus

Briggs cups his mouth and hollers out to sea
BRIGGS
Kaback Reinnardt Colony I want every
one of you to look at the man on your
left Now look at the man on your right
Feel sorry for those two sons a bitches
theyre gonna get it youre not gonna get
a scratch

Delancey manages a thin smile The others are made even more
nervous by Briggs pep talk Miller shoots Briggs a glare

MILLER
(to Briggs)
Cut the crap

Speaks calmly to the men

MILLER (CONTD)
Keep it simple sides of the ramp move
fast no bunches When you make shore
correct your elevation and
windageadjust your sights

Miller looks over the gunwale at the HELL IN FRONT OF THEM

LIEUTENANT BRIGGS
Go LCTs Light ‘em up

The entire Higgins boat lights up from above Everyone looks
up at the fourteen thousand rockets passing overhead and
impacting on the beach

MILLER
Look up there Thats what you call a
shitstorm And right now it’s raining
down on every German strongpoint By the
time we land zhey’1ll ail be knocked out

DELANCEY
We’re gonna win

ANOTHER SOLDIER
Were gonna kick ass

AND ANOTHER
Gonna be a big show

MILLERS BOAT
Is heading straight into hell Tracers rip the haze overhead

like a thousand freight trains Explosions pound the surf
throwing columns of water toward the sky
uw

CAPARZO
Sounds like the Midnight Limited

MELLISH
Sounds like the old-fashioned chain flush
in our hallway bathroom

JACKSON a tall gangly southern country-boy with a sharp-
shooters rifle bows his head

JACKSON
Better make yourself right with the Lord

At that moment THE NAVAL BARRAGE LIFTS UNCANNY SILENCE
except for the engines of the Higgins boat descends as the
big guns readjust to fire inland

Everybody gazes up knowing this is it waiting for the final
cue Miller exchanges a look with Sarge begins moving among
che men

MILLER
Good luck See you on the beach Good
luck

He adjusts the Mae West belt on a soldier raising it

MILLER
You get into deep water or step in a shell
hole and the vest inflates you’1ll wind up
head down with your legs sticking out of
the water Good luck I’11l see you on
the beach

THE COXSWAIN

S a scared eighteen-year-old Navy kid He throttles back
cutting speed Miller hollers from the bow

MILLER
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

COXSWAIN
As far as I go

Miller races toward the stern pushing through his men
MILLER
All the way in goddamn it You take us
all the way in

COXSWAIN
I cant even see the marker flags
Miller reaches the Coxswain lunges up into his face

MILLER
All the way in Youre not going to drown
my men

COXSWAIN

I get hung up on a sandbar were never
getting out of this

Miller stuns everybody by pulling his 45 from his holster
jacking a round into the chamber and jamming the gun into the
Coxswains nose

MILLER
I dont need you to take us in I want you
tol

The kid immediately throttles forward heading in
Thats when Millers boat runs aground on a sandbar The

Coxswain jams it into reverse then forward trying
desperately to pull it off

COXSWAIN
Sandbar

MILLER
Closer

COXSWAIN
SANDBAR

The Coxswain is suddeniy hit by machine gun bullets He SLAMS
so guickly out of frame that were it not for the lingering
cloud of red mist we wouldnt even know he had been there

Miller left wearing a fine spray of blood like warpaint
turns to his men Theres nothing left to do

FACES OF THE MEN

Staring straight ahead at the steel gate Suddenly it sounds
like the worst hail storm imaginable - a thousand hammers
hitting in sporadic bursts the upraised steel gate of the
Higgins boat

Involuntarily the men start backing away jockeying for
position But there are so many of them packed in that there
is nowhere to go
MILLER
DEPART RIGHT SIDE OF THE RAMP SEE YOU ON
THE BEACH GOOD LUCK

SARGE
Dont bunch up Wanna see plenty a beach
between men

A WAR CRY

Arises from the throats of the men So seasick is everyone
the beach is like a cure An intense swirl of emotions
verging on insanity And in the back of every mind is a
desperate littie voice saying It cant happen to me

The Ramp comes down
ITS A SLAUGHTER
CLOSE UP MILLER

Metal minutiae pink and gray matter smoke and sparks explode
past Miller in all directions

MILLERS POV

Triangulated 20-caliber machine-gun fire rains into the boat
like Gods wrath itself chewing screaming GIs to pieces

Milier can only see the backs of all his men But the heavy
caliber slugs as they pass through the men are not so much
throwing back blood but pieces of mess kit canteen shrapnel
sections of shovel canvas and rubber from rended Mae Wests

In less than twenty seconds two-thirds of the men are piled
into each other dead or dying A dozen survivors make it
over the corpses of their comrades to the ramp and throw
themselves intc the water Bringing up the rear is Miller

MILLER
Go Go

Miller grabs a screaming Private Delancey by the backpack and
pulls him to his feet from a tangle of bodies inadvertently
saving his life by inches

MILLER AND DELANCEY

Plunge into the deep water to the left of the sandbar

UNDERWATER
And sink like rocks into a WATERY NIGHTMARE WORLD The
sights and sounds are surreal Drowned soldiers are sinking
around us in the murk Contrails of blood from multiple
puncture wounds men still thrashing weakly as their lungs
give out expelling biood and air All manner of equipment
and gear is tumbling down as far as the eye can see Rifles
are sinking helmets are going down

A Higgins Boat with an engine THRUMMING eerily passes right
near us One dead soldier gets caught up in the giant screw
shredding his body and causing the screw to jam and stop

Most ominous of all the surface itself is roiling as if
hammered by rain Machine gun bullets piercing the water
leave fizzy lines for a straight five feet before settling
gently on the murky sandy bottom

DELANCEY

Struggles trying to undo the straps of his heavy pack
Millers in the same desperate trouble -- his pack is dragging
him down

Miller pulls his kniZe slashes his own straps dumps his
pack He grabs Delancey whos panicking losing all his air
Miller manages to cut him loose dragging him up toward --

THE SURFACE --

As the CAMERA FOLLOWS Delancey and Miller EMERGES from the
silent shallows and into the chaos of Omaha Beach Burning
water Exploding sheils Bullets flying Screams of war
Then SILENCE AGAIN as they once more fall back into the water
Then again CHAOS as Miller gains his feet Delancey clinging
to him gasping --

DELANCEY
CaptainJesusthanks

-And a stream of builets slams into his back He arches in
Millers grasp dead on nis feet with a slack look of
surprise

Miller is pinned in two feet of water by Delanceys body He
starts strugglingpaddling towards shore

Delanceys body takes seven or eight more hits jerking about
violently in Millers grasp Miller looks like a man whos
wondering if this wouldnt be a good time to go insane
He Looks around realizing hes not the only one There are
scores of men out here from any number of boats doing the same
thing working their way grimly toward shore some using
corpses for cover past tangled and burning wreckage past
wave-tossed bodies past hundreds of dead fish that keep
washing ashore 7

Miller sees a SOLDIER lift his head then roll over onto his
back in the shallows Miller moves to help him is about to
drag him when—

SOLDIER
(hisses)
Leave me alone

Miller looks at the guy who’s been pretending to be a corpse

SOLDIER
Get away or we’ll both get shot

MILLER
Get up soldier and follow me

Miller throws himself behind another Belgian gate He presses
against it for dear life as MACHINE GUN BULLETS hammer the
metal throwing massive sparks He turns to the soldier

MILLER
Drop your lifebelt
(sees another soldier
wearing his)
Drop your--

Suddenly

WHAM AN ARTILLERY St

DES right behind him knocking
encussion and debris

Abrupt silence We suddeniy cant hear a thing “All sounds

of the battle are gone sucked away in a vacuum as
MILLER

Rises slowly deeply disoriented and bleeding from a dozen
shrapnel cuts holding the Belgian gate for support His gaze
is blank as a blown fuse with a look that says Im done No
more captain no more army no more nothing Just let me
crawl into my basket and stay there

He looks up Hundreds of bodies litter the beach before him
Countless wounded are moaning thrashing calling for help or
“Mommy” (though we cant hear them)

He sees four men trudging up the beach two of them pitch
forward and fail dead from machine gun fire

The sand is a carpet of discarded weapons and equipment A
SHERMAN TANK burns furiously muzzle cocked mutely greasy
black smoke roiling toward the sky

He sees GI falling to the sand and firing his weapon in a
panic shooting and killing one of his fellow GI’s running in
front of him The soldier stunned by what he’s just done
looks around looks at Miller an expression of quilt and
horror frozen there forever

Suddenly a PRIVATE is in front of Miller blocking Millers
view staring at him The kid looks like hes waiting for a
reply So do the THREE PRIVATES sharing cover behind a beach
obsticie a few feet away They’re all shivering from the cold
water

SOUND STARTS RETURNING faint but growing louder as

MILLER
Huh You say something

PRIVATE 1
Yeah Are you an officer

Miller shakes his head trying to get his hearing back trying
to clear the cobwebs

MILLER
WHAT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING

PRIVATE
I SAID ARE YOU A GODDAMN CFFICER

Miller has ts think about it a moment finally nods

MILLER
Yeah

Beat The privates trade glances

PRIVATE 2
Well What the hell do we do now sir

Miller sees there are others out there like him -- hanging on
by their fingertips looking more like shipwreck victims than
soldiers but alive

SOUND RETURNS COMPLETELY as we hear

SARGE (0S)
Captain Captain

Miller turns sees Sarge under cover a distance away Hes
been shouting ail this time
MILLER
te Sarge)
Take the men off the beach

PRIVATE 3
Sir whats the rallying point

MILLER
(pointing toward the
cliffs)
Anyplace they cant shoot you

Miller is pointing about 200 meters up the beach near the base
of the German cliffs at the shingle--a low seawall of rocks
and sand topped with barbed wire Hundreds of GIs are already
up there in ragged groups-- digging foxholes keeping low
tending wounded

Miller turns and hollers at a private

MILLER (CONTD)
Soldier
(pointing)
The seawall The seawall You see it

SOLDIER 1
(hiding behind a Belgian
Gate)
Tim stayin

Miller shouts to the private and the twenty-five other
soidiers nuddied behind the Belgian Gates

MILLER
Get eff this beach Make room for others
SOLDIER 2
This is all we got between us and the
Almighty
MILLER

Every inch of this beach has been
pre-signhted You’re all dead here
STEADICAM WITH MILLER

-- and DOZENS OF MEN seem to emerge from nowhere following
his lead Theyre crossing No-Mans-Land in the face of
furious enemy fire just like their fathers did a war ago
using shell craters as foxhnoles scrambling on hands and
kneesleap-frogging positions using knocked-our tanks for
coverdoing some serious broken-field runninggrabbing up
discarded weapons or helping a wounded friend as they go
Many are brutally cut down simply dropping as their legs stop
working

WOUNDED SOLDIER
(screaming)
Mama Mama

Miller makes it to the next obstacle-- tree trunks sticking up
out of the sand at thirty-five degree angles He crops behind
one falling into 4 pile of terrified young men several of
whom are clutching typewriters and boxes of office supplies

MILLER
(aghast at what theyre
holding)
What are you guys

YOUNG MAN
6lst Medical Battalion sir Here to set
up field operations

MILLER
(re typewriter)
Get rid of that junk Pick up weapon

Come with me
MILLERS POV
So many of the men are so burdened down with gear and
ammunition that they can barely walk One YOUNG BOY takies
off all of his gear and helps another GI take off his Now
down to tank tops and trousers both men pass

A GUY WITH A FLAMETHROWER

WHOMP Small-arms fire hits the flamethrowers cannister and
a burst of flames gushes out engulfing the two running men

All three fully immoiated now are mercifully cut down by
machine gun fire
tw

SOLDIER
Thats called going to hell ina hurry

Miller dives behind another Belgian gate finding Lieutenant
Briggs wounded on the sand
BRIGGS
Get me back Get me off the beach

There are several engineers wiring the obstacle Briggs has
taken shelter behind with high explosives wrapping a C-pack
around the base of the Belgian Gate The men work quickly
Miller pushes one of the men away

MILLER
What are you doing

ENGINEER
Army engineers sir Assigned to blow a
path for DD tanks

MILLER
All the armor is foundering in the
Channel tLook around there are no DD
tanks

ENGINEER
Sorry sir gotta find another cover Im
blowing this one

The Engineer pulls a fuse lighter from his helmet Miller
doesnt argue He grabs Briggs by his pack harness starts to
drag him

Running alongside of Miller is a very unusual sight A
soldiera recent amputee-- is running holding his own arm
znstead of his rifle He gets to the shingle tosses the arm
over the seawall then hurtles himself behind it screaming
Medic the whole way

On this strange sight an EXPLOSION throws Miller off his
feet The first thing Miller does is look down at his legs
Sensing hes not wounded he gets up and starts hauling Briggs
oy the pack harness again but Briggs seems lighter Miller
looks back to see he is only carrying half of him

Suddenly Sarge grabs Miller slams into him propeling him
along both men hobbling the last dozen yards to --

THE SHINGLE

-- where they hurl themselves to the ground exhausted
Soldiers making it off the beach are likewise tossing
themselves to safety up and down the seawall --

but safety is a relative term The Germans are raining
MACHINE GUN AND MORTAR FIRE all along this position The
noise is unbelievable Casualties are mounting and piling up
in long zows packed in tight like cigars It is hard to tell
the dead and wounded from the exhausted Constant cries of
Medic “Aidman and Hey Medic

CLOSE-UPS Miller sees a lot of faces staring at him
Stripped of gear huddling under scantcover many wounded

the soldiers look exactly like what they are -- a bunch of
scared kids some of them weeping out of control
MILLER

Whos in command here

SOLDIER 4
You

Thats what Miller was afraid of He looks to Sarge

MILLER
You recognize where we are
SARGE
About a mile from where were supposed to
be
SOLDIER 5
Nobedys where were supposed to be
SOLDIER 6
Were badly intermixed sir We got the
leftovers from L company A company E

company some Navy demolition guys and
beach marking crews

Miller looks around seeing a’ ragged mix of regiments and
companies He spots a RADIOMAN in the chaos his back to us
yelling into a field phone Milier scrambles to him grabs
his shoulder pulls his face into view --

MILLER
ASK ABOUT OUR AIR SUPPORT TELL EM WE
HAVE NO AIR SUPPORT

-- the radioman turns away relaying the message Miller
grabs his shoulder again brings his face around a second time

MILLER (CONTD)

AND TELL EM NO HEAVY ARMOR IS GETTING
ONSHORE THE C-3 DRAW IS NOT OPEN WHERE
ARE THE GODDAMN DD TANKS THEYRE NOWHERE
NEAR THE DRAWS

urns away hollering into the phone Miller
hird time --

MILLER (CONTD)
AND TELL EM--

-- the radioman t
grabs him yet at

-- and pulls him around to find half his face suddenly gone
The man pitches -ifelessiy to the sand

Miller grabs the radio but its bullet-riddled He

belly-crawls back to Sarge Plunging suddenly into frame as
bullets rip the seawall is

REIBEN
I want a word with Eisenhower

SARGE
You seen anybody else

REIBEN
Jackson but thats it

He points back the way he came JACKSON is at the seawall
Mellish sharing cover with Caparzo hollers over

MELLISH
Here sir Mellish
CAPARZO
Caparze We got DeForest back there with

Wade 2s nurt so bad Wade says he aint
gonna make it

MILLERS POV

We glimpse WADE the company medic through a chaos of smoke
and scrambling men (Wades older than most mid-to-late
20s Well come to know him as steady and soft-spoken) Hes
kneeling on the sand over a dying soldier desperately trying
to save the man ts obviously a losing battle -- the chest
wound is bad and Wade is bloody up to his elbows But Wade
keeps working

Another soldier passing Wade on the right is shot through the
helmet and killed instantly

Wade hauls the body over along with two others making human
sandbags out of whats left Wade continues working The Body
takes two more hits One slug passing through the body and
going right into the brain of Wades patient

WADE
(screaming)
Fucking shit

At that moment several hands enter frame and pull Wade away
Wade is dragged up the hill to the shingle

RESUME MILLER AND SARGE

MILLER
Thats it Thats all thats left

SARGE
We got scattered pretty bad sir Theres
bound to be more of us

MILLER
Not enough Not enough

INCOMING MORTAR ROUNDS POUND THE LINE

A DOZEN MEN are killed bodies thrown lifelessly onto the
sand Six or seven bodies falling out of the sky pinning
living men deeper into the sand Others digging them out
Everybody seems to be SCREAMING for a CORPSMAN A CORPORAL
belly-crawls up to Miller

CORPORAL
(frantic)
What are your crders

MILLER
Gather weapons Whatever we got Drag
‘em in off the sand if you have to

SARGE
Wheres you B4AR Reiben

REIBEN
Bottom of the channel Sarge Bitch tried
to drown me

SARGE
Find a replacement

The word is relayed up and down the line voices hollering

VOICES
WeaponsWeapons Bring ‘em up

The rumor of a breakout spurs the troops The fact that any
action is being taken has a galvanizing effect Guns and ammo
are gathered handed along made ready Men are even braving
the German bullets to dash out and pull weapons in off the

sand -- A machine gun here a bazooka there M-1s pistols
MILLER
Whos got bangalores
VOICES
(up and down the line)
BangaloreWhos got bangers Were
lookin Were lookin Were
lookin BANGALORES

MELLISH and CAPARZO

Are eyeing a 30 caliber machine gun lying about 10 yards out
Like a pair of hungry dogs eyeing a bone

MELLISH
You run fastern I do

CAPARZO
Youre a smaller target

MELLISH
Forget it

They both break cover racing out to grab the weapon
RESUME MILLER

AS someone nands him the Thompson with spare clips Weapons
are coming in from both directions along with men willing to
use them PVT BOYLE shows up with a flamethrower still
strapped to his back Millers impressed

MILLER
You brought that all the way in

BOYLE
Not by selection sir The buckle is
jammed I cant get the fucking thing off
me

He proves his point by yanking on the buckle Frozen solid
ANGLE SHIFTS as a PAIR OF ENGINEERS arrive with bangalore
torpedoes (long tubes filled with TNT)

SARGE
Any shit is better than the shit were in

The procedure begins many hands pitch in attaching the
bangalores end-to-end and feeding hem out onto the shingle
toward the German barbed wire

We are watching the true miracle of D-Day taking place when
all the planning faiied when all of the calculations proved

wrong when the whole damn thing fell on its assit was the
common soldier who made it work anyway They seized the day in
dribs ana drabs desperately improvising their way to victory
in small rag-tag groups like this one Men are gearing up
knocking sand out of their weapons working the bolts loading
ammo

Mellish and Caparzo are oiling the kinks out of their newly
acquired machine gun

THE BANGALORE

Inches closer to its mark nearing the barbed wire

Is riveted Wade appears at his side with his medics pack
and M-1 preparing to go Reiben is loading a BAR

The bangalore is in place Miller gives the signal The
engineer twists the detonator handle BOOM The dust clears
revealing a gap in the barricade

SARGE (CONTD)
THROUGH THE HOLE

Miller heaves himself onto the seawali and races for the gap
followed by a dozen men

The German machine guns redirect their fire tracking the
runners Several men are hit and go down one body tangling
in the barbed wire The others plunge through the gap --

SWAMP FLATSOTHER SIDE OF BARBED WIRE

-- and theyre through racing like crazy across the swamp

flats toward the escarpment
AT THE SHINGLE
SOLDIER 7

If I gotta die its gonna be goin
uphill

He lunges over the top and breaks for the wire Thats all it
takes -- another two dozen men break cover following his
lead

THE ESCARPMENT

Is a maze of deep-winding furrows caused by erosion Plenty
of room to hide Especially if youre German

The GIs start up the slope sticking to the deepest furrows
using them as natural trenchesworking their way
uphillleap-frogging positions and keeping lowpausing
briefly to assess the blind turns

REIBENS POV

Five men turn right on a blind curve inside one of the
trenches

There is a hideous explosion of small-arms fire Two of the
men run back out bumping into eleven more GIs heading the
opposite direction Reiben stops when he sees the log jam

Suddenly four -- eight -- twelve German grenades (potato
mashers) start to bombard the log jam Reiben leaps back
just before a dozen tremendous EXPLOSIONS

Reiben picks himself up on an elbow It literally starts to
rain red covering everything in Reibens general position

MILLER
THIS WAY THIS WAY

MILLER

Runs down a cath three Americans round a corner ahead of him
A PAIR OF EXPLOSIONS Miller rounds the corner and sees the
remains of two GIs just killed by a mine

THE THIRD GI stands frozen knowing hes in the middle of a
mine field

GERMAN VOICE (0S)
(whistles then frantically
calls)
FRITZ FRITZ

A GERMAN SHEPHERD DOG races past Miller pointedly avoiding
the mined path and three others as it races toward the unseen
German voice

Miller watches the dog catching a glimpse of a wildly
relieved German Soldier grabbing his pet in a protective
embrace pulling it to safety around the corner

Before Miller can react the same German soldier reappears
FIRES HIS RIFLE shooting the frozen GI in the nead killing
him The DOG BARKS the German ducks back gone

Several Americans bunch up behind Miller trying to cnoose the
path -
AMERICAN SOLDIER
Mines Goddamn it

ANOTHER AMERICAN
Krauts gotta use one of them

Miller takes off choosing the path that Fritz the dog just
ran

ANGLE ON ANOTHER GAP

Following behind Miller we come to a gap in the path nothing
but 30 or 40 feet of open space to cross on a blind angle
Problem is you have no idea what is waiting for you until you
poke your head out

The MACHINE GUNS sound close now We are also hearing the
POOF-POOF-POOF of mortars nearby

Miller motions everybody to wait He grabs a bayonet and a
tiny mirror from an inside pocket He looks at the men eyes
falling on Mellish who is chewing gum and watching him with
puzzlement Miller unceremoniously digs the gum out of
Mellishs mouth usess it to affix the mirror to the tip of
the bayonet

Ye eases the bayonet out angling it around to see
REFLECTION IN MIRROR

Its shaky but effective about 20 yards up is a SANDBAGGED
EMPLACEMENT WITH TWO MACHINE-GUN CREWS blasting away at the
beach below Next to the position are TWO MORTAR TEAMS
popping shells at the sky and some ADDITIONAL INFANTRY

The mirror angles slowiy up giving us the final bit of bad

news Ten yards past the machine guns is a CONCRETE BUNKER

with the MUZZLE OF AN 88 looming from the long horizontal
firing port Anotner shell fires WHUMP

MILLER
Pulls the mirror back in

MILLER
Two 642s two heavy mortars over sixty
up twenty 88 in the bunker

SARGE
We dont got the angle We dont got the
angle from where I sit
(pointing)
Theres the perfect firing position but
its the journey of a lifetime

MILLER
Lets get the draws open Lets get the
draws open

Miller motions to four men huddled near him

MILLER (CONTD)
Davis DeBernardo Young Valk Go

The four men take an instant to get ready and then scramble up
the path and disappear over the rise into the gap Miller and
his men blast suppressing fire

Germans pour fire into the unseen gap
Bad angle for the Americans No Germans are hit

The four men dont emerge from the unseen gap Miller ducks
out takes a quick look

Se

e
ives

s the smoking bodies ci the four men Ducks back as Sarge
es imto the rocks next to Miller

SARGE
Good Christ why not just hand out
blindfolds it’s a firing squad

MILLER
Sarge there’s two kinds of people on this
beach Those that are dead and those that
are about to die We have to get ‘em all
the hell outta here

Miller turns to the next four men
MILLER (CONTD)

Weiss Stuart Jezler Keough youre
next

The second four move to the head of the gap Miller moves for
a better angle against the machine guns Calls to Jackson
the sharp-shooter

MILLER (CONTD)
Jackson Put some fire on that crew

JACKSON
Yes sir

Miller signals others where to direct the cover fire Turns
to the second four

MILLER
Go

The second four take deep breaths race out and disappear
into the gap

The Germans pour a river of fire into the unseen gap Miller
and others blast suppressing fire Jackson nails one of the
Germans Not enough

No one emerges from the other side Miller doesnt need to
look this time Miller turns looking for the next four His
eyes fall on Sarge and Reiben Reiben smiles

REIBEN
Captain can I put in for a transfer

MILLER
Meet me at the top Well start the
paperwork Dickerson Berger you too

The third four move into place

Sarge and Miller exchange a look They both see the madness
in wnat they are dozng Miller and the others open up on the
Germans

MILLER (CONTD)
Go

Sarge rolls his eyes takes a breath scrambles towards the
gap Disappears the other three right behind

The German fire increases Potato masher grenades bounce
down explode below A pair of screams Two bodies fall down
the cliff Dickerson and Berger

Miller dives to a much more exposed position in the rocks
fires more effective cover German bullets ricochet around
him He is cut by rock fregments but not hit directly

An instant later Sarge and Reiben come out of the gap and
into view scrambling into the relative safety of the
overhang

The German fire shoots toward the exposed Miller who curls
himself into a tiny ball trying to make the most of his light
cover behind the rocks

Under the overhang Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves

REIBEN
(mantra-like)
Im not dead Im not dead Im not dead
Im not dead

Millers mind races Bullets chatter and rip He notices
that Jackson is closest to the outcropping at the other end

MILLER
Jackson You ready to get across

JACKSON
Any czimes good sir

Miller steps into the open Events play out in fractions of

seconds
THE GERMAN MACKINE GUNNER

Sees Miller just standing there a perfect target swings the
machine gun toward him

MILLER
Stands firm as 3ULLETS RIP THE GROUND in his direction --

MILLER
GO

--and Jacksons up and running Miller throws himself back

barely making it his boot heel getting BLOWN OFF as Sarge
and the others drag him in

SARGE
CAPTAIN IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT
SHED BE VERY UPSET

MILLER
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER

Jackson makes it across the gap to the outcropping The
German gunner tries to adjust but hes too late

The pissed-off gunner KEEPS FIRING battering the gap with
bullets trying to nail Reiben trying to nail anything
Reiben is yelling and screaming everybodys going crazy

except Jackson Hes the calm at the center of the storm
He works his rifle bolt raises the scope to his eve --

RIFLE SCOPE POV

and tries to pin the German gunner in the crosshairs Its
not easy motion and smoke fill the frame

JACKSON
(quietly)
Be not thou far from me O Lord

JACKSON tries to tune out the noise and fury around him
especially

REIBEN
GODDAMN IT ROY PULL MY ASS OUT OF THIS
IM BEGGING YOU ROY OH JESUS CHRIST

MILLER
Jackson do you have a shot

A-pause everybody helding their breath waiting for a reply

JACKSON
Send the next three over

Jackson squeezes the trigger and--

--the German cgunners head snaps back as the bullet exits the
back Oo his neimet His partner is stunned snoves the pody
aside grabs tne weapon to take over

The NEXT THREE Gis break from cover racing across Reiben
scrambles to his feet sprinting for dear life

JACKSON
O my strength naste thee to help me

Jackson squeezes cff another shot nailing the second German
The man pitches over the machine gun CHATTERING and then
stopping as it pitches off the cliff The gun falls 25 feet
nailing ONE OF THE GIs in the back of the head knocking him
unconscious TWO CTHER MEN pull him through the gap

A third German runs up shouting to the others

GERMAN 3
DIE FLANKE DIE FLANKE
And Jackson drops him too Three for three
JACKSON
Amen

Thats it Without the machine gun the German flank is wide
open The Americans surge up the gap with a wild cry
storming the German position with everything theyve got

The battle is short and fierce

MACHINE GUN TEAM 2 frantically tries shifting their gun to
the gap but bullets cut them down Their supporting infantry
scramble over to cover the flank THE MORTAR TEAMS scatter
for their weapons RETURNING FIRE

Mellish and Caparzo slam their machine gun down and OPEN FIRE
raking Germans off their feet

Reiben advances with his 8AR blowing HUGE HOLES across the
tops of the German sandbags killing two of the enemy

Miller and his men swarm the German position Soldiers on
both sides are cut down in the blink of an eye -- but the
Germans are flatly overwhelmed

Pvt Boyle has the final word -- he hoses the area with his
flamethrower frying anything that still moves cartridges
EXPLODING like fireworks cn all the burning bodies A WALL OF
FLAME mushrooms skyward on a column of black smoke

MILLER
BUNKER

The GIs keep going racing for the bunker RIFLE AND MACHINE
GUN FIRE ERUPTS from within taking down a few men --

-- but Miller and che rest are too fast slamming into
position at the bunkers base Miller signals for grenades
Pins are popped The GIs lob the grenades into the bunker
through the horizontal firing port above their heads and --

WHAM-WHAM-WHAM CONCUSSIVE BLASTS leap from the port trailed
by billowing smoke The GIs jump to their feet SPRAYING
SMALL ARMS FIRE through the bunker port just to make goddamn
sure

and then its over All thats left now is the slow dazed
aftershock of terror and adrenaline Wade hurries to the aid
of a wounded man moaning on the ground

Miller and the others look around stunned -- we did it
Were alive After the beach its more than any of them
expected Nobody says anything because there really arent
words to express the moment Were here Its a fact

Mellish crouches down picks up a KNIFE that’s fallen on the
ground There’s a swastika on the handle

MILLER
It’s a Hitler Youth knife

MELLISH
Not anymore

Mellish examines it another moment then tucks it into his
belt as a souvenir

SARGE (0S)
Oh my God

Miller turns follows Sarges gaze

SARGE (CONTD)
Thats quite a view

ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal the beach below and the ocean beyond
Allied ships crowd the horizon Closer to shore everything
in the water seems to be shattered and burning Subsequent
waves of landing craft are threading through the carnage and
hitting the beach Troops are still running for the safety of
the shingle by the hundreds Shelis are bursting Fire and
smoke is everywhere Its horriblemind-boggling

Dear Madam I have been shown in the

the Adjutant-General of Massachusetts that
you are the mother of five sons who have
died gloriously on the field of battle

The room gradually grows quiet as busy aides” and secretaries
stop to listen

GENERAL MARSHALL (CONTD)
I feel how weak and fruitless must be any
words of mine which should attempt to
beguile you from the grief of a loss so
overwhelming But I cannot refrain from
tendering to you the consolation that may
be found in the thanks of the Republic
they died to save

General Marshall stops reading continuing from memory

GENERAL MARSHALL (CONTD)
I pray that our Heavenly Father may
assuage the anguish of your bereavement
and leave you only the cherished memory of
the loved and lost and the solemn pride
that must be yours to have laid so costly
a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom

Miller and his men sit inside one of the craters taking a few
moments of RandR

the others didn’t

JACKSON
Wasn’t luck Someone on high kept an eye
on you

REIBEN

I’m an atheist Jackson

JACKSON
Like they say “There are no atheists in
fox holes”

MILLER
So if any of you by some world class
fluke were in Allied High Command which
soldier would you send The one with
experience Or the one fresh off the
base

They all sit there quietly a moment Reiben nods looks at
Miller

REIBEN
I see wnat you mean Big battle like
that I guess theyd rather have us more
amazed than afraid

And now the others are thinking about that too

MILLER
Longer a soldier’s been in the field
better chance his number’s gonna come up
or so he’s likely to think Fear’s no
longer the voice in the next room it’s
right there inside your helmet screaming
at you every minute of the day You can’t
let that happen

to him respectfully Miller is a mess -- dirty unshaven and
blood-spattered Though the uniforms of the other men in the

sees Miller and motions for him to wait

We expected thirty-two tanks to float
to the beach twenty-seven went
underwater I understand your problem
but if we dont get those dual drive
Shermans off-loaded by 0600 were going
to have an entire division at Carentan
with its ass hanging out of its pants

As Miller waits he looks around the room He notices a
steaming cup of coffee and a half-eaten sandwich He sees a
small pin-up of Betty Grable His eyes are drawn back to the
coffee and the sandwich

ANDERSON (CONTD)
«-alright let me know when

Anderson hangs up and speaks to an AIDE

One of them is TIM UPHAM a thin twenty-four-year-old
patrician with gentle thoughtful eyes behind his thick
glasses He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
EXPLOSION then he forces himself to concentrate on his work
Miller strides in

MILLER

Upham raises his eyes from his map and refocuses

UPHAM

from the horizon)
Just trying to make room for Ryan

Reiben shoozs Milier a smile and shifts his entrenching tool
from under nis brused ass

THEY ROUND and BEND

See a long straight stretch of road Half-a-dozen
obliterated American vehicles A gauntlet to run As they
speed down the road all eyes except Uphams very nervously
scan the surrounding hills

MELLISH
Captain something just occurred to me

MILLER

MILLER

The other men let this sink in a moment then -
MELLISH
And of course by everybody you mean the
other one hundred and fifty thousand guys
with the four thousand armored vehicles
ammo and food That’s the everybody
you’re talking about right sir

MILLER
That’s correct

MELLISH
Just checking sir

MILLER (CONTD)

Everybody grabs what they can and scatters away from the jeep
hauling ass and gaining precious yards hitting the dirt as

WHAM Direct hit A STUNNING BLAST The jeep cartwheels thirty
feet in the aiz and SLAMS BACK DOWN AGAIN in a flaming heap

THE MEN

Barely out of the BLAST PERIMETER STUNNED by the concussion
SHOWERED with dirt rock debris They raise their heads

CAPARZO
Wellat least the jeeps out of the
ditch
Suddenly we hear POOF-POOF-POOF-POOF

MILLER
HERE COME THE MORTARS

THEY ALL TAKE OFF

Running as fast as they can LOTS OF MORTARS firing The
eight men run madiy through the gauntlet of MORTAR EXPLOSIONS

BOOM

RUNNING STUMBLING

BOOM BOOM BOOM

UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND

Miller yanks him Half-drags him to the edge of the field
THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES

-- where they go crashing through branches finally collapsing
to safety about thirty yards in The mortars have stopped The
men are completely used up struggling to catch theiz breath

SARGE
Sound eff if anybodys hit
(looks around)
Anybody

UPHAM
(touching his nose)
I got a little nosebleed here

but thats it They look around amazement slowly dawning
fear and adrenalin draining away Nobodys hit Softly

WADE
Its a mixacle

Nobody laughs On

ly Wade can say something like that and get
away with it -- bes

ides they know hes right

WADE (CONTD)
Weve got an angel on our shoulder Maybe
this Ryans good luck for us

REIBEN
Lets not get carried away He did get our
jeep blown up

Panting Struggling to catch their breath Check their body
parts Everythings there They have their weapons but have
lost a lot of gear

Reiben looks back through the trees at THE SCOUT CAR which is
nothing more than a smoldering shattered carcass He shakes
his head

REIBEN (CONTD)
General Craig is going to be very upset
with you Captain

Miller checks his men gives himself a second to get oriented
then jerks his head for his men to follow

MILLER
Lets move out

The men hesitate

SARGE
Sir arent we going to go take care of
those eighty-eights

MILLER
Thats not what were here for

JACKSON
Wouldnt take us but a minute sir

MILLER
We have our orders Lets go

Miller heads off without pausing or looking back The men
dont like it but they follow

EXT HEDGEROW CART ROAD - DAY

Miller walks point His men follow warily Its hot

Theyre exhausted Upham looks miserable weighed down like a
pack horse with all the 8AR ammunition slapping at
horseflies They talk quietly their eyes scanning

JACKSON
(shifts his load)
Grant me strength Lord

REIBEN
If we find Ryan and hes still alive that
son-of-a-bitch is going to carry this
BAR all the way back to the beach for
me

WADE
What are you griping about Reiben
Mellish is ABAR hes got your heavy
stuff you dont hear him complaining

REIBEN
Thats ‘cause Mellish is strong as an ox
and twice as smart

MELLISH
(flips him off)
Up yours Reiben

REIBEN
Up mine Up Ryan’s Eagie Scout my ass
Only merit badge the guy ever got was for
givin’ the clap to the family cow

They come to A BREAK IN THE HEDGEROW A small brush-lined
stream Good cover

REIBEN
This goes against everything the army
taught me Makes no sense--

Miller signais stop

MILLER
Break Jackson Caparzo here here
cover

They ail head to the stream Jackson and Caparzo set a close
perimeter defense The others fill canteens piss rest

MILLER
What doesn’t make sense Reiben

All the men look at Reiben now

REIBEN
The math sir Of this mission Maybe you
couid explain it to me

MILLER
Sure Reiben what do you want to know

REIBEN
Well sir in purely arithmetic terms
whats the sense in risking eight guys to
save one

MILLER
Anybody want to answer that

WADE
Jesus Reiben think of the poor bastards
mother

MILLER

Very good Wade
REIBEN
Hey got a mother We all have mothers
Wade Sarge Corporal Insect Captain
Ill bet even you have a mother

Miller smiles Reiben eyes him and reconsiders

REIBEN (CONTD)
Well the rest of us have mothers

UPHAM
Theirs not to reason why Theirs but to
do and die

They all look at Upham a moment

MELLISH
You just make that up book boy

UPHAM
(shakes his head)
Yean I just made that up

MELLISH
What the hell’s it mean We’re all
supposed to die

UPHAM
Never mind

MILLER
Upham’s talking about Duty He’s saying
that you’ve got orders And that
supercedes everything including your
mother Even if you think the orders are
stupid

JACKSON
Sir I have an opinion on this matter

MILLER
By ail means Let’s hear it

JACKSON
Seems to me Capn this mission is a
serious misallocation of valuable
resources

MILLER
Go on

Miller

Reiben rolls his eyes

JACKSON
Well sir seems to me God gave me a
special gift made me a fine instrument of
warfare What I mean by that is if you
was to put me with this here sniper rifle
anywhere up to and including one mile from
Adolf Hitler with a clear line of sight
wars over Amen

MILLER
Reiben pay attention This is the way to
gripe Jackson continue

JACKSON
Yes sir It seems to me sir that the
entire resources of the United States Army
oughta be dedicated to one thing and one
thing only and that is to put me and this
here weapon on a rooftop smack-dab in the
middie of Berlin Germany

REIBEN
What about you Captain

looks at Reiben shocked

MILLER
Reiben whats the matter with you I
dont gripe to you Im a captain
Theres a chain of command Griping goes
one way up only up never down You
gripe to me I gripe to my superior
officers Up get it I dont gripe to
you dont gripe in front of you How
long nave you been in the army

Im sorry s11r

(beat)
But if you werent a captain or if I were
a major what would you say

apologize

MILLER
(considers)
In that case I would say this is an
excellent mission with an extremely
valuable objective worthy of my best
efforts

obvious sarcasm

Miller plays it straight with no

MILLER (CONTD)
In addition as I pointed out earlier I
have a fondness for cheese and I hope to
have the opportunity to sample some of the
Neuville products when we arrive there
to see if they live up to their excellent
reputation Moreover I feel heartfelt
sorrow for the mother of Private James
Ryan and Im more than willing to lay down
my life and the lives of my men
especially you Reiben to help relieve
her suffering

The men thoroughly enjoy the performance

MILLER
Let’s move out

The men get to their feet with more energy than they ought to
have

EXT WOODS - DAY

Miller still walks point his men following Upham falls in
alongside Caparzo still trying to break the ice

UPHAM
So Where you from

CAPARZO
Get stuffed

So much for Caparzo Upham turns to Reiben

UPHAM
You

REIBEN
Drop dead And another thing Up-Ham
Every time you salute the Captain it
makes him a target for the enemy So
knock it off Espcecially when I’m
standing next to him

Okay fine Upham falls silent Mellish is staring at him

MELLISH
You writing a book book boy

UPHAM
As a matter of fact yes
MELLISH
Names Mellish Stanley Mellish of the
Chicago Mellishes im gaunt and wiry
with piercing steel-gray eyes and
chiseled darkly handsome features
dont you take notes

WADE
Whats your book about Corporal

- UPHAM
I don’t know It was going to be about
the bonds of brothernood that develop
between soldiers in war but now I’m not
so sure

REIBEN
Why don’t you go ask the Captain where
he’s from

The other men snicker

MELLISH
That’s a great idea Ask the Captain

Upham looks to Miller whos ahead out of earshot

UPHAM
(wary)
All right I’ll play along Where’s the
Captain from

CAPARZC
You figure that out you got yourself one
nice prize

JACKSON

Over three hundred bucks last I heard

WADE
Companys got a pool five bucks gets you
in whoever guesses where the Captains
from and what he did as a civilian gets it
all

UPHAM
Somebody must know where hes from and
what he did for a living

SARGE
Somebody probably does

’ UPHAM
Why dont you just ask him
él

a JACKSON

The Captain prefers not to discuss certain
aspects of his life in particular
everything up to and including his
enlistment in the United States Army

SARGE
Ive been with him since Kasserine Pass
Im closer to him than I am to my own
brother but I dont even know what state
hes from Somewhere in the Northeast as
’ near as I can figure I dont even have a
clue what he did for a living

Reiben shakes his head

REIBEN
No ones gonna win that money for the
simple reason that the Captain never was a
civilian They assembled him at 0CS
out of spare body parts from dead GIs 1
’ know this for a fact

JACKSON
You got something against the Capn

REIBEN
Hell no I think hes the best officer
in the army

For once Reiben isnt bullshitting They all nod in assent

JACKSON
You got that right

Upham watches Miller with even more curiosity
EXT - NEUVILLE - DAY

A small town mostly reduced to rubble WE HEAR sporadic
SMALL-ARMS FIRE grenade and mortar EXPLOSIONS some MEDIUM
ARTILLERY in the hills AMERICAN PARATROOPERS with the 101st
croucn in doorways and hunker down in the rubble exchanging
GUNFIRE with an unseen German force Its a snipers alley

Some FRENCH CIVILIANS dash across the street -- a MAN a
j couple of WOMEN several CHILDREN They make it across
disappearing into the remains of a building

ANGLE ON MILLER

As he enters frame g flattening against a wail near a
corner his men closing ranks behind him Miller pokes his
head out takes a quick mental snapshot (US troops gunfire
ruined buildings beyond) pulls back SMACK -- a bullet takes
a chunk out of the brick near his head Miller yells out

MILLER
Thunder

A PAUSE THEN

VOICE (0S)
Flash Come on across

Miller takes a moment then takes off GERMAN BULLETS BLAST
kicking up the cobblestones behind him Miller zig-zags and
makes it to the cover of the far side

Upham watches Jackson sees his expression

JACKSON
Its okay they cant kill him

SARGE
Like hell they cant

REIBEN
Jacksons right its some kind of
scientific magnetic thing I cant
explain it but Ive seen it

CAPARZO
We all have hes got nine lives or hes
bulletproof or some damn thing

The men are equal carts joking and admiring Sarge is
neither

SARGE
No ones builetproof No one

MILLER

Ducks out of a doorway crouch-runs down the block makes it
to

AN ALLEY
TEN PARATROOPERS are bunched there in the rubble just out of

the line of fire Theyre dirty battered and exhausted
Among them are PRIVATES GOLDMAN AND HASTINGS

Miller sees that four of the paratroopers are wounded and
calls back down the block

MILLER
Wade

GOLDMAN
You guys are a sight for sore eyes

HASTINGS
Sergeant Hill our relief showed up

SERGEANT HILL scurries over

SGT HILL
How many are you

Wade ducks into the alley and quickly starts treating the
wounded The rest of Millers men arrive as the scene plays

MILLER
Just eight of us were not relief
Sorry
SGT HILL
No What do you mean sir
MILLER
Were looking for a Private James Ryan
GOLDMAN
Huh
SGT HILL

Ryan What for

Miller ignores the question

MILLER
Is he here

SGT HILL
Maybe in a mixed unit on the other side of
town

SGT HILL

Hard to get to Germans punched a hole in
our center a few hours ago cut us in two
Whats his name again

MILLER
James Ryan Private Dropped in with the
10lst

SGT HILL
(back over his shoulder)
Runner forward

A YOUNG PRIVATE wearing no gear comes forward

SGT HILL (CONTD)
Locate Captain Hammil Theres a
retraction squad here looking for Private
Ryan James probably a misdrop from the
One-O-One

The runner looks over the low wall and around the corner
and takes off

ANGLE MILLERS MEN
All of them get in better positions to watch the runner

SGT HILL (CONTD)
(to Millers men
The streets have been quiet for a couple
of hours The Germans arent bothering us
here as much as over there

The men wait
ANGLE THE RUNNER

Hes a smaller figure now ducking behind walls quickly
crossing streets

Just as he is about to round the courner what SOUNDS like
popcern popping Dirt explodes up around him in the street
and ne goes down on one leg

Sergeant Hill and the rest of the men pour in supressing fire
But they dont quite know where to shoot because the shots are
coming from around a blind corner

SGT HILL (CONTD)
Hold your fire

ANGLE THE RUNNER

Hes trying to crawl for cover More sounds of popcorn
exploding More dust hits around him

Suddenly he is lying very still Pause Then more sounds
of innocuous popcorn More dust hits The Runners body is
shaken with multiple hits

Mellish stands up

MELLISH
(stand up screaming)
The sadistic fucking animals

ANGLE THE RUNNER

Hes clearly dead But the popcorn sounds continue The body
is being hit dozens of times

SGT HILL
They know were not in direct contact
Theyre going to single out the runners

MELLISH
(yelling)
Why do they keep shooting him up
MILLER
As long as theres breath in him he

still has the message
Miller notes the rage and fear on all the mens faces

MILLER (CONTD)
Our side does the same thing

That gets the mens attention

MILLER (CONTD)
(re wounded men)
Wade get ‘em ready to travel

SGT HILL
Boyd ry again see if you can let
Captain Hamill know were coming

BOYD with a SCR 536 walkie-talkie searches for something
other than static

Milier steps to the mouth of the alley and eyes the street
Sgt Hill steps up next to him

SGT HILL (CONTD)
Well backtrack two blocks then right
get those buildings between us and
wherever that insulating fire is coming
from

SGT HILL
Next blocks got two story buildings both
sides of the street lot of windows then
a wide open square with pretty good cover
on the left

MILLER
Sounds okay Four men up Two of mine
two of yours

Sgt Hill shoots a quick glance at Miller appraising him He
seems to know what hes doing Sgt Hill nods

SGT HILL
Hastings Goldman up front

MILLER
Reiben Caparzo

Boyd with the walkie-talkie shakes his head

BOYD
Theyre still jamming us

The four men move up to take the lead The others get ready
helping the wounded to their feet

MILLER
Reiben Mellisn Fundamentals short
runs double up at the corners one man
close one man wide
(fixes his bayonet to his
rifle)
Prepare for close contact

CLOSE REIBEN

Staring at the failen shattered Runner not saying much of
anything

ANOTHER ANGLE

They take off scurryingcrouchingdarting through the rubble
those at the rear helping the wounded along making their way
up the street They leap-frog positions hug doorways for
cover scan windows and rooftops for snipers

Its incredibly tense boots scuffing over cobblestones
figures darting this way and that looks traded and
acknowledged signals given -- I think were clear till there
lets go keep moving you next

They come to a house where an entire wall has collapsed and
fallen away Three entire stories of rooms are visible and

intact

the furniture still in place

They hear something CREAK above Everybody drops into a

crouch

Beat

weapons snapping up ready to open fire
SGT HILL
Thunder
Nothing
MILLER

Thunder goddamn it or we open fire

MAN (0S)
Ne tirez pas On est francais

UPHAM
Theyre civilians

SARGE
Yeah Lets see ‘em

UPHAM
Montrez-vous

A MAN appears above peering down from a second story living
room Hes French all right -- so is his WIFE and MOTHER-IN-
LAW All appear with hands raised talking at once

FRENCH FAMILY
Ne tirez pas On est pas des soldats et
on est pas arnes Baissez vos fusils

MILLER
Stop jabbering One at a time
(to Upham)
Ask them where the Germans are

UPHAM
Ou sont les allemands

MAN

MILLER
What Whats he saying

UPHAM

The French pull THREE SMALL CHILDREN into view The father
takes the first one by the wrist a little girl and dangles
her over the side She starts CRYING as he tries to hand her
down averybody talking at once

MAN
Je vous la passe

UPHAM
They want us to take them--

MILLER
--wait no tell them we cant take

UPHAM
-nous ne pouvons pas les prendre avec
nous

-- but the man drops the girl down A PARATROOPER catches her

Then the French man drops ANOTHER CHILD a boy about five
confused scared letting the grown-ups pick him up and sort
out the confusion

The French woman grabs the other kid whos starting to cry

There are now two French kids down with the American
Millers pissed losing control of the situation

LITTLE BOY
Je veux sas y aller

WIFE
Tu dois Vous serez en securite avec les
americains

UPHAM
They think theyll be safe with us

MILLER

‘em its not safe

UPHAM
Ils ne seront pas en securite avec nous
vous ne comprenez pas on ne peut pas les
emmener

MILLER
Goddamn it that one first back up
Caparzo grab her

Caparzo picks up the sobbing little girl lifts her Hes
short of the task so he climbs up on a fall of rubble to gain
some height The French are crying calling down begging the
soldiers to take the kids

MILLER (CONTD)
Tell ‘em again Make ‘em understand

UPHAM
Vous devez comprend que les enfants seront
plus en securite ici

Caparzo hoists the little girl up The father is weeping as he
reaches down almost gets a firm grip on her wrist ----

and at that moment a high-powered SNIPERS BULLET WHINES IN
and blows through Caparzo in a spray of blood He flies off
his feet and slams onto the cobblestones

The girl falls unhurt but terrified and confused The SOUND
OF THE GUNSHOT comes an instant later

The girl and her little brother stand paralyzed in the open
Everyones yelling at once the Americans and their parents

CAPARZO
IM HIT IM HIT

Wade and Upham break cover Wade to help Caparzo Upham to
grab the kids

MELLISH
CAPARZO

CAPARZO
OH GOD IM SHOT

Sarge grabs Wade and pulls him back to cover Miller grabs
Upham by the back of the collar and yanks him back roughly
choking him Upham gags

ANOTHER SHOT HITS just where Upham would have been

The two childen stand frozen Nothing happens Theyre not
targets

SARGE
STAY DOWN

SGT HILL
GODDAMN IT WHERED IT COME FROM

Miller looks to Jackson whos got his head cocked listening
JACKSON

Wasnt close Bullet put him on the
ground ‘fore we heard the shot

Everybodys trying to see where the gunfire came’from
Caparzos SCREAMING on the pavement and the French family is
CRYING with fear for the children

WADE
We gotta get him out of there

MILLER
You stay put Wade goddamn it

CAPARZO

Looks down at his wound MOANS He reaches into his shirt
pulls out a letter Sees that its bloody

CAPARZO
OhGodoh

REIBEN

Peering out from behind rubble as ANOTHER BULLET WHINES IN and
blows a chunk of debris into his face He jerks back blood
suddenly trickling down the side of his face

MILLER -- THE INSTANT THE SECOND SHOT COMES IN MILLER DASHES
OUT GRABS THE KIDS AND PULLS THEM BACK TO COVER

and a second cr two passes before we hear the actual
GUNSHOT ECHOING Miller looks to Jackson

MILLER
Jackson

JACKSON
Two thousand yards Capn maybe more

UPHAM
Over a mile

The French parents sob with relief The kids stand next to
Miller watching everything wide-eyed no longer crying
Tl

Everybody scans for likely sources Miller points at a chateau
with a chapel belltower on a nillside more than a mile away
Jackson nods hes already seen it

JACKSON
Thats where Id be

CAPARZO

Feels himself fadingtries to focus on the blood-spattered
letter he holds

CAPARZO
-help mesomebody

MELLISH
You hang on Caparzo Hang on buddy

JACKSON

Stows his standard-issue sniper rifle pulls a zippered case
off his back He opens the case and removes an unusual
long-barreled rifle flicks down a two-legged stand attaches
a scope working intensely as

UPHAM
What is that

JACKSON
Thirty-ought-six Norton long barrel
Armys only got two hundred of these

He works the bolt loads a single oversized shell

UPHAM
They gave you one You must be a hell of a
shot

JACKSON

Not where I come from
CAPARZO

With every movement causing intense pain Caparzo wads up the
letter

CAPARZO
Help me

Wade and Mellish focus on Caparzo dying to rush to him held
firmly in place by Millers command
WADE
and Dont talk

MELLISH
Well be with you in a sec

CAPARZO

Wade turns to Miller pleading

WADE (CONTD)

MILLER

Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards out FIRES
Evaluates Notices Upham staring

a JACKSON (CONTD)
Checking for drift

Jackson re-loads puts his eye to the scope shifts his aim
toward the chateau Waits Finger on the trigger Absolutely
motionless

CAPARZO

With every effort he can mustez throws the letter toward Wade

Captain
CAPARZO

MILLER

a Stands riveted in place Eolding himself togetherbarely

JACKSON
Waits His eve at the scope

JACKSON
O my God I trust in thee let me not be
ashamed

IN THE CHATEAU BELLTOWER

The GERMAN SNIPER is on his stomach in the shadows scanning
through the scope of a much more impressive German rifle

JACKSON (VO)
let not my enemies triumph over me

GERMAN SNIPER POV (THROUGH SCOPE)

as he tries to pin another victim in the crosshairs He
pans the rubble past Caparzo thrashing weakly on the ground
and findswhat the hell is that Something poking over the
rubble Is that a head barely visible behind it Wait

itsdackson aiming his sniper rifle
THE GERMAN SNIPER

Realizes hes aiming at another sniper aiming right back at
him Their scopes are locked both men pinning each other in
the crosshairs Theres a soft intake of startled breath The
Germans eyes widen and his finger goes frantically to the

trigger ---- and Jacksons bullet blows straight up through

the Germans rifle scope blowing the back of his head off in
a blast of shattering glass and blood The German dies

instantly fle slipping from his fingers and plummeting

to the courtyard below Jacksons GUNSHOT ECHOES the
countzyside seconds later

RESUME TOWN

Wade and Meliish rush out to Caparzo as Jackson lowers his
rifle and nods done

Wade Mellish with the others right behind find Caparzo
dead Eyes glazed and staring

MELLISH
Oh no

REIBEN
Goddamn itGoddamn it
74

Wade turns and looks accusingly at Miller who holds his glare
for a moment then speaks coldly

MILLER
Thats why we cant take any goddamn kids

The men are jarred by his brusque manner Off their looks

MILLER (CONTD)
What do you want A Viking funeral Sing
a few hymns Maybe wait around for
another goddamn sniper

Miller kneels down takes one of Caparzos dogtags and pockets
it Then he stands and jerks his head in the direction they
were heading

One by one the others follow Reibens wiping blood off his
face mutters darkly to Mellish

REIBEN
So much for that angel on our shoulders

MELLISH
Its still there its just shitting down
our necks

As he starts to go Miller looks down and sees Caparzos
bloody wadded-up letter to his parents Miller sees Wade
looking at it also They lock eyes for a moment each waiting
to see if the other is going to pick it up

Finally Wade bends down and picks up the letter and puts it
in his pocket He avoids looking at Milier as he follows the
others down the street

Miller waits for a4 safe gap then he brings up the rear
scanning the street and the surrounding buildings doing his
best to keep his men safe

EXT - STREETTOWN HALL BUILDING - DAY

Here they come more cautious and tense than ever Fingers on
triggers Hearing SMALL ARMS FIRE here and there

They come to a house and flatten into doorways Hill looks
across the street at the town hall building and scans the
upper levels Somebody darts past a window up there Miller
nudges him points -- theres a machine gun muzzle aimed at
them through an upstairs shutter A voice calls down

VOICE (O0S)
Thunder

SGT HILL
Flash

The machine gun muzzle eases off Hill cocks his head at
Miller -- lets go They break cover and hustle across the
street toward the town nall heading for several huge crumbled
holes in the wall

INT - TOWN HALL BUILDING - DAY

A central lobby level with banistered landings above and all
around The place is gloomy and claustrophobic clogged with

Wreckage and fallen beams

Millers group enters a back room through the holes in the
wall relieved to be inside at last They proceed past
sections of caved-in ceiling toward the lobby trying to
adjust to the gloom sensing the presence of men ahead

There are MEN up there barely discernible in the shadows
Huddled and whispering The GIs come around some fallen beams
behind them BOOTS CRUNCHING on fallen plaster ---- and the
group spins around Thevre Germans INSTANT SCREAMING
PANDEMONIUM ENSUES as both sides snap their weapons up
fingers taut on triggers everybody hollering at the top of
their lungs for everybody else to surrender

EVERYBODY AT ONCE
(frenzied mixture of German
and English)
PUT YOUR GODDAMN GUNS DOWN--WELL OPEN
FIRE--GONNA SHOOT YOU DUMB SONS OF
BITCHES--2UT EM DOWN NOW--SAID PUT THE
GODDAMN GUNS DOWN--

And then SILENCE No one moves says a word One of the

Germans ioses it pulls the trigger on his weapon but it

misfires with a loud CLICK Miller and his men realize he
tried to shoot them are still processing this when--

-- an ENORMOUS VOLLEY OF MUZZLE FLASHES ERUPTS from the
panisters above the Amercans heads Its a stunning barrage
of machine gun fire tearing explosively down through the
banister posts The Germans are blown back off their feet
bullets chewing through them in clouds of smoke and blood the
entire group sprawling backward in a tangle of bodies A dying
Germans Schmeisser goes BRRRAAAAP at the ceiling and brings
down a chandelier

Abrupt stunning silence Fragments of banister flutter down

Sarge looks to Miller Everybodys stunned trying to get a
hold of their adrenalin

SARGE
Enough to make you old

MILLER
Lets hope

Millers group rises and turns peering up

as a DOZEN AIRBORNE TROOPERS appear above rising from
behind what used to be the banister and stepping forward to
look down Leading them is CAPTAIN HAMILL who gives Miller a
puzzled look

MILLER (CONTD)
Weve come for Private Ryan

EXT - RAILROAD SWITCHING YARD - DUSK

Not to mention one of our men

Miller hears Sarge but doesnt respond Hamill approaches a
LIEUTENANT

HAMILL

LIEUTENANT
(hollers back)
Ryan Front and center

A FEW MORE VOICES HOLLER BACK as the message is relayed After
a few moments PRIVATE RYAN appears coming across the tracks
Hes a goofy-looking kid

Millers men are watching Ryan approach Reiben shakes his
head derisiveiy

REIBEN

But Ryan just keeps crying harder

RYAN

Ryans inconsolable The tears just keep coming

RYAN

Guys come up patting his shoulders trying to caim him down

Miller feeling utterly stupid turns to Hamill

MILLER
Sorry for the trouble

HAMILL

(dryly)
Military intelligence

They walk back to Millers men as snickers spread along the
perimeter -- paratroopers having a laugh at their expense

MELLISH

Gods laughing at us Hes looking down

JACKSON

and howling

OLIVER

Miller watches his men go He gives himself a second steps
to a fallen wall and looks out at what remains of the once
lovely village now nothing more than rubble Hamill steps up
next to him Though strangers Miller and Hamill speak like
tired old friends

HAMILL (CONTD)

MILLER

Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamills forceful
sincerity He shakes it off

MILLER
So wheres this church

They head off together
INT - CHURCH - NIGHT

A single stained-glass window remains intact -- an ANGEL
watches over the righteous from a pall of heaveniy light
TILT DOWN to Miller and his men settling in for the night in
the ruins

SARGE
Jackson youre first watch

Jackson grabs his rifle goes to a sentry point where the wall
has collapsed to create a sloping egress of rubble ANGLE TO
Reiben pacing and agitated Everybodys on edge emotions and
nerves working overtime

REIBEN
Fuck Private James Ryan fuck him just
fuck the goddamned son-of-a-bitch

JACKSON
God amighty Reiben give it a rest
Youre killing me

REIBEN

Its not me killing you pal its Ryan
Caparzos just the first you wait and

see

WADE
Ryan didnt kill Caparzo A German sniper
did

MELLISH

Might as well have been Ryans finger on
that trigger

MILLER
Thats enough We move out in two hours
try and get some sleep

The men settle down into the debris and try to follow Millers
order

EXCEPT FOR WADE

Miller looks over and sees him recopying Caparzos letter
Wade glances up at Miller then continues copying pointedly
ignoring Miller

Miller looks at the rest of his men then pulls out his map
case and his flashlight He turns it on Alone in the dim
glow of the light he studies his maps Two men in two
glowing balls of light on opposite sides of the shattered
churcn

INT CHURCH - NIGHT (LATER)

Dark ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE The men including

Wade sleep Miller still sits in the glow of his flashlight
studying his maps His hand starts to shake He stares at it
a moment and it stops He looks up sees Sarge lying nearby

watching him

MILLER
I was just thinking the guys here are
going to have a hard time holding out
until help shows up

SARGE
Yep

MILLER
If we stayed we could make a difference

SARGE
Youre kidding yourself

MILLER
You never know

They sit in silence for a moment

SARGE
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it

MILLER
Now youre the one kidding yourself
(beat)
r - Hell of a mission

Sarge looks away at the men

SARGE
How longs your hand been shaking

MILLER
(beat)
A-couple of weeks It started in
Portsmouth when they brought us down for
loading

SARGE
Is it getting worse

MILLER
No it comes and goes It stops when I
look at it

SARGE
What do you think it is

MILLER
I don’t know

a SARGE

You may have to get yourself a new line of
work This one doesnt seem to agree with

you anymore

MILLER
Ill be airight

Miller looks at his watch rises and barks at the men

MILLER
Rise and shine boys Lets go

Grumbling the men get up and start shouldering up their gear

EXT FIELD - NIGHT

The little bank of Americans walks along the edge of a field
parallel to a cart path Wary Theyre just a small squad
but these seven heavily-armed men in full battle gear are

very formidable-looking

Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each
other He SNAPS HIS FINGERS getting their attention and

motions curtly for them to open it up a bit

A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON

Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT The sky is on fire The AIR
TREMBLES A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the
countryside like a tidal wave

Then THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL

ITS A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY is
incredible strange other-worldly

EVERY MAN IS TRANSFIXED

Frozen in place The lights play on their faces They watch
a moment then move on

EXT CROSSROADS - NIGHT

Dark FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY Miller checks the map as
Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional
signs

Miller puts away his map Checks the horizon The first glow
of dawn is visible

MILLER
Itll be light soon Lets pick it up

EXT FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

First light The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by
the CHIRPING OF BIRDS The Americans are taking five

Miller stands a bit apart from the others looking out at the
view Its loveiy Dew shimmers on the long grass The war
is far away He sees Upham sitting with his notebook open and
walks over to him sits down beside him

UPHAM

This is all good for me sir
MILLER

Hows that
UPHAM

“War educates the senses calls into
action the will perfects the physical
constitution brings men into such swift
and close collision in critical moments
that man measures man”

MILLER
I guess that’s one way to find the bright
side

UPHAM

Emerson was my favorite writer I’ve read
everything he ever wrote

MILLER
He’s alright But personally I liked the
Tennyson you quoted the other day better
I guess he’s one of my favorites

Upham surprised looks at Miller a moment

MILLER
Even though some people say that “Charge
of the Light Brigade” was a lousy piece A
“newspaper poem” they called it But I
still like it

UPHAM
(beat)
Where are you from Captain

Miller smiles

MILLER
Whats the pool up to

Upham smiles caught

UPHAM
Over three-hundred

MILLER
Tell you what when it hits five-nundred
I’ll give you the answer and well split
the money

UPHAM
If thats the way you feel why dont we
wait until its up to a thousand

MILLER

I might not live that long
Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it

UPHAM
Five hundred then

Miller stands considers Upham a moment

MILLER
Just so you know the others no matter
what they say they’re all just as afraid
as you are

UPHAM
I’m trying to control it sir

MILLER
You can’t completely and I’m not sure you
should
(then)
“Fear is in an instructor of great
sagacity and the herald of all
revolutions”

UPHAM
Was that Tennyson sir

MILLER
Emerson I thought you said you read
everything he wrote

Milier takes a last look at the view Then he turns back into
a commander

7 a MILLER

Lets go Corporal

Miller strides away Upham watches him trying to figure him
out then ne simply follows him

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING
Sarge is walking point The others are behind him
REIBEN
You know what the best thing that could
happen is
JACKSON
You step on a rusty nail get lockjaw and
never say another word again as long as
you live

Miller laugns making sure the men hear

MILLER
Ill bite Reiben
REIBEN
The best thing that could happen is we
find Ryan and hes dead

MILLER
Whys that

REIBEN
Well sir consider the possibilities A
Ryan is alive We have to take him back to
the beach Knowing you you dont let him
carry my gear even though he should and
we all get killed trying to keep him
alive

MILLER
Except for the last part that ones not
bad

REIBEN
B Ryan is dead We find him blown up
into a million pieces floating around in
some river bumping into himself Were
trying to fish him out a piece at a time
like Humpty Dumpty when the Germans pick
us off one after another

MILLER
I dont like that one at all

REIBEN
Neither do I sir C And this is the
worst one we find Ryan and hes wounded
Not only does he not carry my gear we
have zo carry his gear And him

MILLER
Thats a possibility

REIBEN
Thats why Im saying sir Best possible
situation is hes dead we find his body
more or less intact we grab one of his
dog-tags and high-tail it back to the
beach

WADE
I dont think Ryans mother would like
that

REIBEN
Dont start with the mother Ever occur to
you she might not even like the guy

UPHAM
Shes his mother

REIBEN
So Maybe hes been a pain in the ass
since he was born Maybe it was the other
three she loved Maybe she always wished
she could send little Jimmy back for a
refund

JACKSON
Yeah maybe he accidently killed Bessie
her prize Hereford or burned down the
barn by accident playin with matches

MELLISH
Maybe they werent accidents

MELLISH
Maybe he’s one of those mean farm boys you
hear about likes to torture the chickens
rub the blood on his overalls

Miller listens wondering about the direction the griping has
now taken

EXT BEAN FIELD - GLIDER GRAVEYARD - DAY

Quiet murmuring chaos Half-a-dozen American gliders Five
of them are intact opened up at the rear gear and men gone
The sixth glider has crashed into a hedgerow on the far side
of the field

Lots of people and activity in the field

FRENCH REFUGEES cid peopie women children ail with
essential or poignant possessions -- an elegant suitcase full
cf food a wheel-barrow piled high topped with a birdcage
An old woman carries a portrait of some deceased relative A
little girl maternally pushes her favorite doll in a miniature
stroller Some are arriving others are already camped out

AMERICAN WOUNDED most are clustered around the wrecked
glider A couple dozen at least More are being brought in
-- some walking others in commandeered civilian vehicles an
old farm truck a battered milk-wagon

There are OTHER AMERICAN TROOPS mostly paratroopers Some
are bringing in wounded Others are arriving in small groups
joining clusters of paratroopers already in the field

OTHER AMERICAN TROOPS have dug in setting up a defensive
perimeter A handful cf French children watch them
admiringly

MILLER AND HIS MEN

Approach trying to make some sense out of the chaotic
gathering

NEAR THE WRECKED GLIDER

A young American Air Corp pilot LIEUTENANT REINHART sees
them and motions

REINHART
Captain

Miller motions Wade to the wounded Hes already on his way
to them Miller eyes the mixed gathering of peopie curiously

MILLER

REINHART

Reinhart shakes a little sack he has attached to his belt
REINHART (CONTD)
Dog-tags More than I want to count sir

Milier nods He and his men look at Reinhart with respect
MILLER
Were looking for a Private James Ryan
Baker Company of the 508th
REINHART
You got me sir A lot of guys have been
in and out of here
Miller calls over to Wade whos with the wounded

MILLER
Wade

WADE
Not here

Miller motions Upham toward the other paratroopers

MILLER
Upham go check those guys

Upham heads off
AT THE WRECKED GLIDER

Sarge looks in and sees a body pinned between whats left of
the bulkhead and a jeep that smashed forward at impact

REINHART
I couldnt pry him out of there I need a
winch

Sarge notices stars on the dead mans helmet
SARGE
Stars

REINHART
General Pratt Deputy Commander
Hundred-and-First Some fucking geniu
had the great idea of welding steel pl
onto our deck to keep the general safe
from ground fire Unfortunately they
forgot to tell me until we were just
getting airborne Like trying to fly
freight train gross overload trim
characteristics were all to hell I
almost broke my arms trying to keep it
level

Miller and his men stop and listen

REINHART (CONTD)
When we released I cut as hard as I
could tried to gain some altitude ke
from stalling didnt work We came d
like a fucking meteor this is how we
ended up The others stopped easy we
were just too damn heavy wet grass
downward slope twenty-two guys dead

(beat)

Guess it was real important to keep
General Pratt alive One man

Reiben nods

REIBEN
Lot of that goin around

Miller snocts him a look Then he nods He

MILLER

Reinhart hands Miller the sack of dog-tags
to Jackson

MILLER (CONTD)

Ss

Miller hands it

Jackson see if you can find Private Ryan

JACKSON

Yes sir
REIBEN
(cheerfully)

Reiben grabs the bag takes a handful passes it on to Mellish
who takes a handful They start checking tossing tags back
into a pile on the bag

REIBEN (CONTD)
Think hes here

JACKSON
Bet he is Bet the son of a bitch is

-and something strange takes over something like a touch of
gambling fever The men start going faster and faster as if
it were a game or competition first one to find him wins

MELLISH
»bet I find him first
REIBEN
screw you hes mine
MELLISH
-cmon know youre in here
JACKSON

MILLER
James Francis

MELLISH
(reading closely)
Uhno its Reyes R-E-Y-E-S thats

He tosses it onto the pile Reiben laughs

REIBEN
Close my ass

The search continues Miller smiles then he notises the
disgusted expressions on the faces of Sarge and Reinhart

Then Wade appears behind them His expression simmering just
below furious his voice very low and steady

WADE
What the hell are you doin Those guys
out there can hear you
(indicates the dogtags)
and those guys are dead You wanna
keep it down

The men stare at the tags then silently continue checking the
names

MILLER

Finds himself stunned confused Not sure who or what he has
become He struggles to pull himself together Reiben
Jackson and Mellish finish checking the dogtads

JACKSON
Hes not here sir

Miller nods and walks away from the glider

Upham approaches motioning back toward the men to whom he
just spoke

UPHAM
No Ryan

Miller keeps walking toward the middle of the field and the
jumbled gathering of civilians and Gis

Sarge rises looks to Miller

SARGE
Now what sir

Miller shoots him a look -- drop dead for asking Miller
stalks off toward the road The others grab their gear go
after him

MILLER
(muttering)
goddamn radios dont workchain of
command doesnt worknothing in this
goddamn war works

The men trade looks Is he griping or is he losing it

MILLER (CONTD)
Heres an idea lets split up into two
groups and wander the countryside calling
his name sooner or later hes bound to

hear us
SARGE

Good thought sir but could take a while
MILLER

Lets ask the locals maybe theyve seen

him
(stops an OLD COUPLE)
Parlez vous Ryan Oui Non

The old couple speaks to each other in French decides
Millers crazy move away from him

Coming into the field with some refugees is a RAGGED COLUMN OF
GERMAN PRISONERS escorted by SOME PARATROOPERS The
paratroopers have seen some heavy action many are walking
wounded Miller calls to the nearest group of them

MILLER (CONTD)
Hey 101lst You know a guy named Ryan

The men shake their heads pass by Miller keeps going tries
the next grouc

MILLER (CONTD)
Ryan Anybody know Ryan

The men pause One of them looks at his buddy -- is that name
familiar He turns hollers at a group further back

PARATROOPER 1
Hey Joe Doesnt Michaelson pal around

JOE
(hollers back)
Yeah I think so

PARATROOPER 1

JOE nudges the man next to him -- MICHAELSON

oblivious to the conversation so far Joe motions “come on

not until the pair arrive and the conversation begins

MILLER

Millers group is electrified Miller is pleased

MILLER
Thank you private

MICHAELSON
HUH

Miller mimes thanks Michaelson motions youre welcome
and the other paratropers move on

MILLER PULLS OUT A MAP
He spreads it on the ground and motions to his men

MILLER
Gather ‘round

Miller kneels his men hover over the map

MILLER (CONTD)
Were here Ramelle is here on the
Merderet River about fourteen miles
west-by-northwest

SARGE
You know about this bridge he was talkin
about Captain

MILLER
Yeah

Miller opens up the map wider and gives his men a quick
geography lesson

MILLER (CONTD)

While the Brits and our Fifth Corps go to
Caen Bradleys taking the rest of the
First Army up the east side of the
Merderet River to make a run on Cherbourg
The whole invasion depends on Cherbourg
We gotta have a port

(pointing)
The Germans know it Theyre gonna try
and cross the Merderet and hit Bradley on
his way up Most likely itll be Rommel
and his Panzers

Millers men know what that means Its not good

MILLER (CONTD)
God willing our planes and the 82nd have
blown up every bridge across the Merderet
except for two one at Valognes and one at
Ramelle Those two bridges are now
funnels If we hold them well use them
to take the rest of the penninsula after
we have Cherbourg

He

(beat)
If Rommel has those bridges hes going to
drive his tanks over them and kick the
ever-loving shit out of Bradley and the
First Army before they even get to
Cherbourg

Milley looks at his men and sees that all this has sunk in
He starts folding up his map

JACKSON
Well Capn seems to me we oughta think
about gettin on up there

MILLER
My thoughts exactly Jackson

Miller grabs his gear and starts walking His men follow
EXT - FIELD - DUSK

The sun is setting over the fields Miller and his men are
walking

REIBEN
I‘m just saying it’s easier for the
guys in the Pacific on account of the Japs
don’t look as much like people as the
Krauts do

WADE
Killing a man is the same no matter what
he looks like

REIBEN
Not that there was ever a German worth a
damn Theyre all pricks Always have
been It’s in their blood

Pause Nobody seems to feel much like arguing but theyre all
thinking about it

UPHAM
They cant all be pricks

REIBEN
Name one decent German Go ahead just
one

No response

REIBEN (CONTD)
See You cant there arent any

No one speaks for a moment Then

WADE
Albert Schweitzer

REIBEN
Who

WADE

Albert Schweitzer Hes German

REIBEN
Who the hell is Albert Schweitzer

WADE
He was a famous musician but he didnt
think he was doing enough for mankind so
he got a medical degree and went to
Africa to a very poor out-of-the-way
place to spend the rest of his life
treating the natives No reason other
than they needed medical care and he
wanted to help Hes been there thirty
years now Its because of him I decided
to be a doctor

REIBEN
Both your parents are doctors and it takes
some fucking Kraut to convince you to go
into the- family business

WADE
You asked me to name a decent German I
did

REIBEN

Guy could find something nice to say about
anybody Hitler Hey anybody who likes
dogs cant be all bad

MILLER
Reiben lose an argument for once huh

REIBEN
Yes sir

Reiben shuts up Miller eases up next to Wade and glances
over making sure that Reiben is out of earshot

MILLER
(whispers to Wade)
Albert Schweitzer was born in Alsace
Hes of German descent but officially
hes French

Wade processes that He turns and looks closely at Miller
They share a slight smile then they separate and walk on

EXT - HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

A beautiful hedgerow-lined field of tall grass The seven
Americans walk carefully through the woods to the edge of the
field

Miller notices something He signals stop crouches and scans
the field and the hedgerow on the far side

Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him Jackson points to some
trees nearby freshly shattered and pockmarked with bullets

Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush

WADE
Captain

Staying low they join Wade who has found

A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER A trail of blood and flattened
grass leads from the field They gaze out seeing FOUR MORE
BODIES sprawled in the grass out there

MILLER
(scans the far hedgerow)
In the shadow by those two trees

SARGE
My guess too

UPHAM
What is it

WADE

Machine gun

Miller pulls back into the cover of the brush stands and takes
off his pack

REIBEN
Sir why dont we go around it

MILLER
We cant leave it here

SARGE
We left those eighty-eights

MILLER
Three runners with suppressing fire Im
going right Reiben youre fast youre
up the middle Whos taking left

UPHAM

twenty-four-five

JACKSON
Shit thats nothin I ran twenty-two
flat Woulda made the state finals if

MILLER
Okay cackson goes left We draw fire and
work up Everybody else spread out along
the treeline

The men spread out Sarge pulls Miller aside

SARGE
Sir Rule of thumb says you detail this
one out
MILLER
Which rule of thumb is that
SARGE
How about I go right
MILLER

How abour you take your position

Sarge hesitates sees no point in arguing He moves off
finds a spot from which to fire Miller looks to Jackson and
Reiben -- ready They nod

MILLER (CONTD)
Now

Miller and Jackson take off at full runs onto opposite sides
of the field with Reiben going up the middie Nothing
happens for a moment

and then a GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP murderously loud
shattering the quiet The Gis in the treeline RETURN FIRE

THE MACHINE GUN NEST

Contains THREE GERMANS We dont see faces One mans on the
gun a second feeds the belt 4 third brings up more ammo

MILLER

Draws the first fire He races the bullets dives for cover
bullets screaming over him ---- and the machine gun swings
toward Reiben who aiso hits the dirt with bullets grazing his
helmet ---- and it swings toward Jackson who also dives
----but by now Millers back up and running drawing the
machine gun in his direction He dives rolls ---- and then
its Reiben again drawing gunfire diving ---- and Jackson
running barely making it to safety --

-- and so on the runners leap-frogging and gaining yards
working their way closer until

A bullet slaps Jackson in the arm He spins and goes down

JACKSON
AAHHH SHIT

Reibens up and running drawing fire away from Jackson
And then Miller drawing fire away from Reiben

Now Reiben again getting closer just about grenade-throwing
range

Now Miller closing in from the other side pulling a grenade
angling for a throw

And then Wade breaks cover trving to get to Jackson The
Macnine gun swings CSPENS FIRE Wade stumples sits down
presses his stomach as if punched He looks almost
embarrassed A long exhale of breath

WADE
-ohstupid

UPHAM
WADE

Miller and Reiben pop their pins and throw The grenades arc
into the nest

A moment later a HAND emerges from the nest and lobs Reibens
grenade back out It lands square in Reibens lap
Frantically Reiben scoops it up and hurls it over the top
once again

clutching the grenade the hand lifts BACK UP OUT OF THE NEST
ready to return the volley when--

300M

Nothing now but silence and billowing dust All eyes go to
Wade

SARGE
Wade You hit
No answer Everybody starts toward Wade from all directions
Miller and Reiben come running faster and faster

Uphams the first one there Jacksons next clutching his
grazed arm then the others Miller and Reiben arrive last
stunned to see

Wade took five bullets in the abdomen (four are in the stomach
area but one is higher just below the right nipple He
Looks astonished by the pain can barely breathe A stunned
frozen beat --

MILLER
Oh Wade oh Jesus Christ

-- and they throw themselves to the ground hands grabbing and
ripping througn the medical pack in a flurry tearing Wades

shirt open everybody shoutina and hollering at once

MILLER (CONTD)
--sulfa gimme the sulfa--

SARGE
--shit hes bleeding get pressure on
it--

MELLISH
--help me out Upham shit use your
hands--

JACKSON

--me goddamn it he was comin after me--

MILLER
--more sulfa I need more sulfa--

JACKSON
--oh God Jesus--

MELLISH
--dont die Wade dont you do it--
SARGE
--morphine he needs morphine--

Theyre injecting morphine pouring sulfa getting bloody
Its all a blur a rush of adrenaiin and panicked effort

MILLER
Wade Wade Can you hear me

Wade is looking up at them shaking riding the pain

WADE
-howbad

MILLER
Youre fine youll be okay

Wades hand shoots up grips Millers wrist

WADE
Captain

MILLER
(beat)
I dont know Wade Im not a doctor it
doesnt look good

The morphines kicking in Wades shaking subsides He tries
to raise his head to see but cant gasping with the effort

WADE

MILLER
Z dunno Lift him up a little

Carefuilycarefuily

The others maintain pressure on the wounds as Sarge helps
Miller lift Wade slightly up on one side Miller puts his

hand under him running his hand down nis back Blood drizzles

through his fingers from several gaping exit holes Wades
eyes are fixed on his waiting for the answer

MILLER (CONTD)
(nods)
Exit wound right on the spine small of
the back Its torn up

Wade reacts with a soft sob Miller pulls his hand out now
covered with blood and tissue eases Wade gently back down
The others keep pressure on the wounds (especially the one
below the right nipple Mellish and Upham are both pressing on
that one because its bleeding so much)

WADE
cant move

MELLISH
That dont mean youre dead Wade it
dont goddamn mean it

Wade tries to put his hand to his abdomen to check the wounds
but misses -- his coordination is gone

WADE
«helo me

Miller takes nis wrist guiding his hand Wade presses on the
wounds trying to determine their severity by feel

WADE (CONTD)
is anythingbleeding worse than
others

MELLISH
Yeah me and Upham are pressing on it
its bleeding bad

WADE
show me

They guide his nand to the wound below the right nipple Wade
feeis it Pusnes his finger all the way down into it as blood
wells up past his knuckles The others watch in horror

WADE (CONTD)
oh godmy liverits my liver

UPHAM
What do we do about it Tell us what to
do
Wade gives Milier a look shakes his head The message in his
eyes is clear -- theres nothing you can do Not a thing
WADE

»couid use a little extra
morphinereally could

Beat Their eyes locked Miller realizes what hes asking

MILLER
(to Sarge)
More morphine

Sarge hands it to him Miller-injects Wade

MILLER (CONTD)
Another one

Sagre hesitates Ye and the others are starting to realize
whats going on Miller snaps at him

MILLER (CONTD)
I said another one goddamn it

Sarge hands it over Miller injects Wade a third time
The men can do nothing but wait Theyre still keeping
pressure on his wounds which gives everything the appearance

of a strange laying on of hands

Wade is drifting feeling the full effects of the drug kicking
in

Then Wade motions to Miller directing his attention to the
ground near him Miller turns and sees among the spilled
contents of the medical pack CAPARZOS RECOPIED LETTER
Miller picks up the letter and puts it in his pocket

WADE LOOKS AT MILLER

Gives him a faint smile Eyes glazing Going away

and they actually feel tne life leaving his body under
their hands

The aftermath of silence seems to last forever Nobody knowing
what to say Nobody wanting to be the first to speak

A soit sob Uphams crying

VOICE (0S)
Kamerad

They whip their heads around amazed to see a GERMAN SOLDIER
staggering toward them from the direction of the machine gun
Nest arms raised and head bleeding

GERMAN
Kamerad Ich ergebe mich Nicht schiessen

xeibens amazement gives way to rage He grabs an M-i lunges
zo his feet and OPENS FIRE before anybody can‘react --

REIBEN
YOU SON OF A BITCH

MILLER
Reiben

-- and the German drops for cover as carbine rounds rip the
dirt all around him Miller slams into Reiben from behind
spins him around tries to wrestle the weapon away

MILLER (CONTD)
Hold your fire

--and the brief tug-of-war ends with Miller ramming the rifle
into Reibens gut and knocking him on his ass Miiier stands
over him catching his breath

MILLER (CONTD)
We dont shoot prisoners

and the German rises again on shaky legs arms upraised

GERMAN
Nicht schiessen Ich will mich ergeben

but Reibens still gripped by rage -- he lunges o his feet
and goes after the German The German turns tries to run

MILLER
Reiben goddamn iz

-and Reiben takes the man down with a flying tackle He
r

fe
rolis him over and starts peating the shit out of him fists
flying punching him in the face
The others arrive drag Reiben cff Sarge gets him ina
neadlock like a cowboy wrestling a steer

SARGE
REIBEN ARE YOU GONNA CALM DOWN OR AM I
GONNA KNOCK YOUR BLOCK OFF NOW EASE
OFF

Reiben eases off forces nimself calm Sarge lets him go The
German looks up at Miller battered and bloody voice small

GERMAN
-bittetétet mich nichtIch will

MILLER
Check him for weapons

Mellish and Sarge pat the German down Mellish finds a
Wehrmacht dagger holds it up

MELLISH
Wnats this for Fricassee a few GIs you

They crag the terrified German to his feet He keeps his hands
in the air Reibens glowering barely restraining himsel
REIBEN
Ask him one thing for me I wanna know if
it was his finger on the trigger that took
down Wade

SARGE
Tt doesnt matter Wades dead just the
same

UPHAM

Were not just gonna leave him there like
thator the othersare we sir

The men all look to Miller
MILLER

Organize a burial detail Put the German
to work too Jackson you all right

JACKSON
Bullet took bite out cf my arm Ill be
all rignt

MILLER
Get it cleaned and dressed You and I
stand watch -- youre south perimeter Im
north

Miller speaks with authority but somethings missing Theres
a dead spot in his eyes Its subtle only Sarge really
notices He watches Miller turn and walk away

SARGE
You heard the man Move your asses

EXT - HEDGREROW FIELD - DAY
Dark clouds gathering Millers at the edge of the field

sitting and staring off at the horizon His concentration
seems intense
lll

»-and we realize hes desperately trying to control the
shaking in his hand Its clencned tight

Sarge appears coming up from behind Miller realizes hes not
alone Sarge sits waits (The burial detail is at work bq
Nothing is said for a time and then

MILLER
What was that kid at Anzio the one who
got his face burned off

SARGE
Vecchio

MILLER
Vecchio right I couldnt remember his
name Remember how he used to walk on his
hands and sing that song about the man on
the fiying trapeze

SARGE
Yeah

Sarge nods A stretch of silence Miller looks at him

MILLER
You know the first thing they teach you at
0OCS Lie to your men

SARGE
Oh yeah

MILLER
Not in so many words but thats what it
boils gown to If your men don have
good moraie nothings worth a damn So
if youre scared or empty or half-a-step
from a Section Eight do you tell your
men Cf course not You lie and you lie
to yourself too

SARGE
And how do you do that

MILLER
Thats the easy part numbers Every time
you kiil one of your men you tell

yourseif you just saved the lives of two
three ten a hundred others You know
how many men Ive lost under my command

SARGE
No

MILLER
(instantly)
Ninety-four Ill bet Ive saved the
lives of ten times that number Maybe
twenty times Any number you want See
‘Simple It lets you always choose mission

over men
SARGE

Except this time the mission is a man
MILLER

Thats the rub Caparzo Wade who

the hell is Ryan You put the three of
them in front of me tell me I have to
shoot one no contest Look at my hand
there it goes again

SARGE
Same thing happened to my father He ran
the big press at the Plain Dealer Forty
some years on the job one day his hand
Starts to snake Won’t stop My mother
said it was trying to tell him something

MILLER
And what was that
SARGE
That he was ail used up
Miller looks at him then looks back at his hand
MILLER
Yeah maybe that’s ic

They both sit there quietly a moment then Sarge nods

SARGE
It’s a young man’s war

Miller looks at Sarge all at once they both realize the
absurdity of that statement and they both start laughing

A ROW OF RIFLES

Protrudes from the ground 4s grave markers dogtags hanging
off the triggers The men are done with burial deta
Jackson sits down to rest The German a few feet away
Jackson takes a cigarette from a pack is about to put the
rest of the pack away when he sees the German staring at him

INSIDE THE MACHINE GUN NEST

Reiben and Mellish step inside the nest sift through the
debris In one corner one of the dead soldiers pack has been
ripped open-from the blast While Reiben stares at the two
obliterated bodies that are heaped over the weapon Mellish
crouches down rifles the contents food Extra clothing He
finds a wallet among the contents here some cash some
ticket stubs a foil wrapped condum a picture of A YOUNG MAN
holding a soccer ball The same young man in uniform posing
with HIS PARENTS A lock of someone’s hair

Meliisn looks up from the photo over at the mangled bodies

REIBEN
Hey

Reiben finds a shopping bag from a store in Paris among the
debris He opens it up Looks inside and his smile fades

REISEN
Oh no

He reaches in and pulls out a beautiful RED-SILK TEDDY He
looks down at the body it was lying beside

REIBEN
Son-of-a-bitcn

GACKSON and THE GERMAN

poth have cigarettes in their mouths now as Meliish and Reiben
walk over

JACKSON

Reiben takes one look at the scene and stops cold

REIBEN
What are you giving him a smoke for What

JACKSON
He did his share of digging

REIBEN
He should the bastard

JACKSON
Cmon pass the lighter

REIBEN
Ch he gets my lighter t00 What next

Jackson waits Reiben gives in tosses his Zippo The German
catches it lights up clicks it shut He notices the lighter
is engraved -- a Mickey Mouse hand-done in rough GI style

GERMAN

They all look at him He gives them a tentative smileand
mimes 4 steamboat wheel bouncing jauntilv up and down

GERMAN (CONTD)
Steamboat Willie Oompah oompah

REIBEN
Tell Steamboat Willie to cut che shit or
Ill kill him I dont care what the
Captain says

Upham motions the German silent -- this is not the time The
German complies passes the lighter to Jackson (NOTE From
now on the German will be referred to as Steamboat Willie)

MELLISH
Goose-stepping asshole Bet it was him who
killed Wade

REISEN
Not just him Ryan too that piece of
shit
(off their looks)
Thats two of us hes gotten killed Wade
and Caparzo Hitler should pin a medal on
the prick

Miller and Sarge walk up

SARGE
Gear up were moving out

Everybody hesitates Upham says what theyre all thinking
UPHAM
Shouldn we say a few words For Wade I
mean

MILLER

Wade who I knew a Wade once but hes
dead He died so long ago nobody
remembers him Now get off your ass and
gear up
Looks are traded but nobody argues They rise as we

DISSOLVE TO
EXT - RIDGE - NEARING DUSK

The sun is descending from a canopy of clouds Miller and his
men traverse the ridge with Steamboat Willie heading into the
farm valley peiow

DISSOLVE TO
EXT - WOODS - NIGHT

Milier and his men finish digging in for the night -- theyve
expanded a ditch with shovels to create a communal foxhole
Everybodys exhausted beyond words -- trading shovels for
blankets settling in trying to get comfortable

SARGE
Reiben youre first watch

Reiben sighs grabs his rifle Miller tosses him a blanket

I know youre tired but stay sharp

REIBEN
Yes sir sharp thats me

Reiben climbs up out cf the ditch sits cross-legged on the
edge settles in He pulls the blanket around himself rifle
propped between his knees

REIBEN (CONTD)
-Sharp as a tack

SOFT SNORING from below The others are already falling
asleep Reiben finds himself alone staring off at the woods
listening to crickets in the night

REIBEN (CONTD)
-Sharp
i116

--and it soon becomes apparent that hes desperately trying
to stay awake And iz seems the harder he tries the more
sleep wants to claim himthe more it wants to make him

Grift off

No He shakes nimseit awake forces his eyes open Not gonna
drift off that easy not a chanceno way

Ill just stare at the nightlisten to the crickets
chirpingnothing moving out there

-qQuiet and dark as can bestay sharpthats me

His head nods His helmet goes clunk against the rifle Lets
face it the poor bastard just fell asleep

CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK Reibens dead to the world still
sitting upright

THEN IN THE BACKGROUND

A GERMAN SOLDIER with a Schmeisser enters the clearinda from

the edge of frame rot ten yards away

and then ANOTHER GERMANand then TWO MOREand holy
shit there are dozens of them in the shadows

The first German looks over this way sees Reiben sitting
there (just a shadowy figure from where hes standing)

GERMAN 1
(turns loud whisper)
Das ist es genau hier

Reiben snaps wide awake Frozen like a statue Did I just hear
German being spoken behind me

A flurry of activity and noise suddenly bursts on us as a
COMPANY OF WEHRMACHT converges on this area ENGINES growling
VOICES caliing out -ights sweeping through the foliage

The GIs wake up in 4 total panic thrashing their blankets
aside grabbing for weapons Hands reach up and grab Reiben
yank him down into the ditch Everybodys expecting to go out
in a blaze of gunfire at any moment

-but the Germans are just going about their business in the
background DIESEL ZNGINES ROAR CLOSER A GERMAN SOLDIER backs
slowly across the clearing motioning with his hands

GERMAN 3
Ja das ist gutweiternach

and the MUZZLE OF A TIGER TANK comes easing through the low
branches

GERMAN 3 (CONTD)
Gut Halt hier

The muzzle stops -- thats all well see of the tank For that
matter everything around us is more suggested than seen
were conveying an impression of scale with noises lights
voices calling to one another Somebody hollers loudly

VOICE (0S)
Abschalten Alle ruhig sein

We hear ENGINES SHUTTING DOWN all over the area
and silence takes over again The night returns

Miller and the others are frozen f£g holding their breath
fingers on triggers if it were physically possible for human
beings to shit bricks thats exactly what theyd be doing

Germans are puttering around bg making camp getting homey
One guys whistling Pretty Baby under his breath Now that
its quiet they speak in low tones or whispers

GERMANS 4 and 5 are at the back of a supply truck fiddling
with a shortwave radio They go past a speech by Goebbels
past 4 broadcast of Wagners The Ring”and tune in to Armed
Forces Radio Its the Senny Goodman Orchestra performing How
High the Moon with vocalist Helen Forrest

GERMAN 4
(whispering)
Benny Goodmanklasse

GERMAN 5-
(motioning)
Sshhhmachs leiser

They tweak the volume down and drift away to other parts of
the clearing going about their business

A portly infantryman named DIETER settles in no more than
fifteen feet from Miller and our group He pulls off his
boots rubs his aching feet He looks over this way calls
softly to our guys in the ditch
DIETER
Habt Ihr mal ne Zigarette

Upham throws a look of panic -- hes talking to us
DIETER (CONTD)
Du da im Graben Ich rede mit Dir
Haste ‘ne Zigarette

Upham’s white as a sheet Facial expressions and hand gestures

come in a jumbled rush for Gods sakes dont answer -- we
have to answer -- what are you nuts -- what if he comes over
here -- shit -- okay say something -- what should say

Dieter rises peering wondering why they dont answer

DIETER (CONTD)
Stimmt was nicht

UPHAM FINALLY SPEAKS UP

UPHAM

Steamboat Willie motions to Upham -- here give me the damn
cigarettes Everybody looks to Miller -- we gonna trust the
prisoner Miller sees no choice whispers

MILLER
He tries any shit he takes the first
bullet Reiben

Reiben shoves his BAR right up Steamboat Willie’s ass and
smiles grimly

UPHAM
(starts to translate)
Wenn Du irgendwas versuchst-

REIBEN
I think he gets the message

Willie very aware of the BAR at his back rises partially
from the ditcn Willie tosses a cigarette from the pack
Dieter takes one nods thanksand pats his pockets Beat

DIETER

No need to transiate that gesture Miller and the men roll
their eyes toward heaven -- shit
Steamboat Willi

Dieter chuckles appreciatively notices the lighter
DIETER

He takes the lighter clicks it admiringly a few times

DIETER (CONTD)

STEAMBOAT WILLIE
(considers a beat)

DIETER
Massig Ich tausch Dir gegen das
Feuerzeug und mehr Zigaretten

Steamboat Willie nods -- done deal Dieter happily pockets
the lighter and moves off Steamboat Willie drops back into
the ditch In whispers

REIBEN
Son of a pitch stole my lighter
UPHAM

SARGE
Really
Looks are traded -- this could be a good idea
MILLER
Cmon cmon cigarettes
The GIs turn cut their pockets handing up cigarettes and
whatever else theyve got Mellish hands up a yo-yo
Steamboat Willie takes it gives him a look -- a yo-yo
Mellish responds with a shooing motion -- go on trade it

in the bg Dieters peen raiding the larder for Sausages
cheese bread a siab of baconbut he cant find the knife
°

He turns calls softly to Steamboat Willie

DIETER
Bring ein Messer mit

Steamboat Willie icoks at Upham -- good luck breaking that
news Upham cringes a bit as he does

UPHAM
He needs a4 knife

REIBEN
Christ lets just give the Kraut my
rifle

JACKSON

Beat Miller nods looks to Mellish

MILLER
Give the Kraut his knife back

MELLISH
Jacksons got it

JACKSON
No I dont you had it last

MELLISH
--no I didnt vou did

A frantic search fails to turn it up Finally Mellish pulls
the Hitler Youth knife he found at Omaha beach and looks at
it

SARGE
Good Christ Mellish What’re you waiting
for
MELLISH
It’s a souvenir sir
MILLER
Mellisn Give it up

He hands it up to Steamboat Willie

MELLISH

Steamboat Willie looks at the knife gives Mellish a look
then calls to Dieter and starts tossing over the goods
cigarettes yo-yo

DIETER

Willie shrugs -- why not And then he proudly offers up the
final item Mellish’s knife

STEAMBOAT WILLIE

UPHAM

MELLISH
Son of a bitch

The transaction goes down -- Dieter carves off hunks of bacon
slabs of cheese sausages half a loaf of bread a few tins of
sardines Steamboat Willie gathers it all up

STEAMBOAT WILLIE
War mix ein Vergniigen mit Euch Geschafte
zu machen

DIETER
Jederzeit

Steamboat Willie ducks back down re-joins Miller and the

others in the ditch Theres a pause everybody staring at
the food as if it were the Grail itselfand then Steamboat
Willie earns a few grateful smiles a nod or two of growing
respect -- wow that was good you actually pulled it off

The food is passed around bitten into torn apart consumed
No mistaking the joy in the faces of these men -- hell we got
us a feast Hey pass that cheesewhoa slow down on the
salami I havent had any yet

and suddenly theres frantic scurrying in the clearing
behind them some fast whispering

GERMANS
(various ad-lib)
Stelis abScheisse er kommt

The Germans kill the shortwave hide their stuff scramble to
look soldierly

as MAJOR HOESS strolls into the clearing Hes a frosty
bastard en SS tank commander in black Panzer gear the
Aryan ideal -- blond flinty blue eyes broad shoulders
perfect posture He peers around speaks ever so softly

HOESS
Ich dachte ich hér Musik Benny Goodman

He gives them a faint steely smile I must have imagined it
Good thing toofor all your sakes He walks on

right past our Gis in the ditch His boots pass a mere foot
or two above their headsand then hes gone leaving one
thought on everybodys minds Sarge whispers it to Miller

SARGE
What happens in the morning Theyll see
us and4t first light

Miller has no answer for them Everybody falls silent as we
DISSOLVE To
Fog Glorious wonderful fog Thick as pea-soup

We hear DIESEL ENGINES ROAR A HUGE SHAPE goes by -- a tank
In its wake trudges German infantry though we see them only
as vague shapes Its dawn the Germans are leaving

BOOM DOWN to Milier and his men in the ditch Theyre holding
their breath listening to the Germans depart scarcely able
to believe their good luck

CUT TO
EXT - FIELD - MORNING

An empty fieid - except for one solitary tree - surrounded by
hedgerows The fog has lifted In the bg the men get their
gear together get ready to move out

Steamboat Willie stands facing Miller and the men waiting
Miller looks to Upham

MILLER
I don’t want him to see what direction we
go so he’s gonna walk with a blindfold
for while Just tell him to goa
thousand paces then he can take it off

UPHAM
Wit werden dir dis Augen verbinden Lauf’
eintausend Schritte dann kannst du die ™
Binde abnemen

Steamboat Willie nods pauses

STEAMBOAT WILLIE
Tut mir leid fur den Mann den ihr
veroren habt Den Sanitater Das ist
halt Krieg nicht wahr

UPHAM
He says he’s sorry about Wade He just
wanted us to know that
Miller
around
Willie

Reiben
across

Reiben

Miller

Miller

nods at Steamboat Willie then motions for him to turn
Miller blindfolds him taps his shoulder Steamboat
starts to walk

looks up from his pack sees Steamboat Willie heading
the open field

REIBEN
We’re letting him go

MILLER
Alright everybody on their feet

walks over to Miller now

REIBEN
We’re letting him go

MILLER
We can’t cake him with us

REIBEN
Sir he’s the enemy

MILLER
I’m aware of that Reiben

REIBEN
So he gets to go home to his family while
we go off to get blown away on some fucked
up Public Relations stunt

MILLER
That’s enough Rieban Get your pack on
We’re moving out

REIBEN

You let the enemy go sir
MILLER

I said were moving out

turns to go Reiben stays where he is

REIBEN
No sir

pauses looks back All of the men are watching now

REIBEN
We’re all of us here to fight the enemy
not go save some asshole’s life so his
mother feels better
Reiben

Miller
to do

Miller

starts walking che other way

REIBEN
I’m going back to fight the fucking war

SARGE
Reiben fall in

REIBZEN
No sir I11 spend my life in
Levenworth i have to but I’m not going
with you

looks about at the other men They’ re not sure what

It’s clear theyd like to follow Reiben

MELLISH
I can’t say as understand the logic of

it myself sir

UPHAM
We don’t even have a way back sir once
we do find him Maybe if we had a tank

looks at Jackson
JACKSON

It don’t make sense Captain It’s a
waste a manpower

And now Mellish and Jackon are walking with Reiben Miller
turns to Sarge

anymore cap Wade Who’s next You
said yourself Ryan’s not worth it

(then)
Be easy 2 end this mission right now
Just tell ‘em we couldn’t find the guy
No one’d be the wiser

SARG

They’ re not wrong It doesn’t make sense
aris
Rya

MILLER
You saying you want to go back Sarge
SARGE

I’m saying Reiben’s right We’re here to
fight the war

Miller looks past Sarge watches the men who one by one
walking away from him Reiben looks back

start

REIBEN
Don’t make it go like this sir Come with
us

JACKSON

(backing away)
Come on Captain lead us back to where
they need us most

But Miller doesn’t move The men resume walking He looks at
Sarge who’s in agony now not sure what to do who to follow
Finally

MILLER
I’m an English teacher

All of the men stop cold Turn around and look at Miller

MILLER
I teach high school in Addley
Pennsylvania

UPHAM
I knew it

They all give him a look Miller takes a step towards them
now

MILLER
Back home I tell someone what I do
they’d say it figures But here it’s a
big surprise
(then)

T guess I’ve changed

The men don’t move as Miller considers them all a moment
Tnen-

MILLER
I wonder sometimes if my wife were
watching me here if she would know me
Or even still wanna marry me

Reiben turns to Mellish and mouths the word “Wife”

MILLER
Yes Reiben I have a wife And a mother

REIBEN
Kids sir

MILLER
I have students And think if you were
to ask them to describe me most of them
would probably use words like “good” or
“kind” or “decent” Words that have no
meaning here Words that I’ve had to
forget in order to survive and to lead

Or at least I thought Id forgotten until
this mission came along And as much as
Id like to turn around and go back
dammit if those words won’t let me

So now I can’t help thinking what if this
is what the whole war’s been about for us
What if we look back on this as old men
assuming we live and figure that saving
Private Ryan was the one decent thing we
were able to pull out of this whole
godawful shitty mess

(beat)
Maybe then we’ll have earned the right to
go back home and carry on with our lives

No one says a word Miller stands there a moment facing his
men watching them watching him

REIBEN

An English teacher sir

MILLER
That’s right

REIBEN
Sir I enlisted to get away from people
like vou

Reiben smiles now As does Milier
MILLER

I aiso coach the baseball team
This gets the rest of them smiling

SARGE
All right fall in

As the men do Miller picks up his pack gets ready to roll
when--

MELLISH
For cryin’ out loud

They all follow Mellish’s gaze look off and see Steamboat
Willie’s walxing blindfolded toward the one solitary tree in
the field TT

MELLISH
Don’t even tell me he’s gonna hit that
tree

REIBEN

He’s gonna hit the tree

SARGE
Nah Thatd be too weird

UPHAM
I think Reiben’s right he is

JACKSON
Buck says he misses

MELLISH
I’ll take that action

SARGE
Me too

They all pull out cash as
STEAMBOAT WILLIE

Is walking stoicaily unaware that he’s heading for the tree
He gets nearer and nearer the tree Everybody’s holding
their breath

Steamboat Wilie coes past the tree missinc it bv a foot
REIBEN
Aw shit
JACKSON

Told you so

MELLISH
C’mon pay up

The bets are settled money changes hands amidst laughter and

grumbling Sarge exchanges a look with Miller Both men are
relieved

MILLER
All right let’s move

The men look back at Steamboat Willie He’s about en paces
past the tree when he suddenly trips over a rock falling flat
on his face We hear from a distance

STEAMBOAT WILLIE
Scheiss

He pushes to his feet
going He starts off again - right back toward

- MELLISH
Oh no you gotta be kidding me

BONK Steamboat Willie smacks right into the tree knocks
himself on his ass A howl of LAUGHTER goes up from the men
as the winnings are reversed

Steamboat Willie stands up again straightens his tunic He
walks off again shoulders straight all the time maintaining
his dignity

REISEN
Ten bucks says he falls flat on his face
again

Silence No takers It’s dawning on everybody the fun
they’ ve been having at Steamboat Willie’s expense

JACKSON
If he does I don’t wanna see it

THE GROUP MOVES ON AS WE
DISSOLVE TO

EXT - COUNTRYSIDE (NEARING RAMELLE) - DAY
Miller and the men trudge wearily into view They pause
gazing downand CAMERA COMES AROUND to reveai Ramelle less
chan half a mile away Things seem quiet down there
EXT - FIELDOUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY
The GIs are approaching town through a field of tall grass
All seems very still and silent here unusually so Theres
nothing to greet them so far but buzzing insects

REIBEN

You know sir I’m still gonna make the

son of a bitch carry my BAR all the way
back to the beach for me

JACKSON
Reiben Anyone ever teil you youre
unpleasant to be around sometimes

SARGE
Why can’t you children be more like Upham
Look he’s carrying all the ammo plus the
radio - you don’t hear him complaining do
you

UPHAM
Actually sir I was just thinking

Everybody rolls their eyes expects the worst

UPHAM
-that I’m so tired of this goddamn
walking I’d pay a thousand dollars to see
Ryan crawl through a river of camel shit
just hear my great-aunt Martha fart
“Yankee Doodle” through a field phone

The men are shocked and impressed into momentary silence
Miller finally nods approvingly

MILLER
Very nice Corporal

REIBEN
Guy’s a natural

The SOUND OF AN ENGINE brinas their heads around A GERMAN
HALIT-TRACK comes out of nowhere bDarreling across the field
with a SIX MAN SQUAD OF SUPPORTING INFANTRY running through
che grass A GERMAN GUNNER on the half-track OPENS FIRE with a
MOUNTED MACHINE GUN

The Gis take otf

running in the direction of town crashing
through the tali gr

ass as BULLETS WHINE like hornets

They reach a drainage culvert beyond which are railroad
tracks They jump into the culvert sliding down as bullets
CHEW the lip missing them by inches

they splash across the thin trickle of muddy water at the
bottom of the culvert try to scramble up the other side to
the railroad tracks above

but MACHINE GUN BULLETS SHATTER the wooden ties driving
them back down into the ditch Desperation time -- theyre
stuck in the culvert with the nalf-track bearing down on them
from the field side plus the six Germans on foot

Theres nothing they can do except cake the bastards on They
thrust their weapons over the lip of the culvert and OPEN °
FIREfor ail the good it does The half-track keeps coming
with MACHINE GUN BLAZINGforty yardsthirtytwenty

VOICE (0S)
HEADS DOWN

They whirl around in surprise as --

-- a FLASHK OF BAZOOKA BLOWBACK sends a projectile right over
their heads WHAM It nails the half-track dead on rips it
apart with a FIERY BLAST The vehicle somersaults forward in
flames flips upside-down skids to a stop at the edge of the
ditch right in front of their noses

And before Miller and the others can so much as blink ----
FOUR AIRBORNE TROOPERS lunge up out of the grass like phantoms
and OPEN FIRE with submachine guns raking the German
infantrymen off their feet

Silence Miller and his men are stunned They gaze up at the
YOUNG PARATROOPER with the smoking bazooka who just saved
their lives Hes tall and athletic a good-looking blond kid
kneeling on the railroad tracks looking down at them with a
touch of amusement in his eyes

RYAN
Im Ryan Who are you

OFF THEIR STUNNED LOOKS WE
CUT TO
EXT - RAMELLE SRIDGE - DAY

The town lies in shattered ruin from Allied bombing Miller
and his men approach the bridge escorted by Ryan and the four
troopers from the field -- SANDERS TOYNBE WELLER OTOOLE

OTHER PARATROOPERS watch them approach a few even melting out
of the woodwork as they pass The bridge is where most of the
men are its clearly the key spot being held There are two
heavily sandbagged machine gun emplacements -- one at each end
of the bridge

Were seeing just over a dozen paratroopers in total all
privates And as tired as Miller and his men are these guys
look worse -- haggard unshaven some wounded They look like
the settlers in some western whove been holding the fort
against constant Apache raids

ON THE BRIDGE

Millers group arrives at the bridge CORPORAL HENDERSON (the
only non-private) moves from the sandbag emplacement to meet
them flanked by RICE and TRASK

HENDERSON
Sir if youre our relief Im filing a
complaint

MILLER

Cant say I blame you Whos your
commanding officer

Henderson cocks his head Miller turns to look SEVERAL DOZEN
CORPSES lie covered with tarps along the riverbank

HENDERSON
That would have been Captain Jennings
sir Im afraid the best we can muster
right now is a corporal -- thats me
Henderson
(beat)
What are you guys doing here

Miller nods his head at Ryan

MILLER
We came Looking for him
RYAN
(surprised)
Me
MILLER
James Francis Ryan From lowa

RYAN
Yeah Peyton Iowa Whats this about

MILLER-
Im sorry to have tell you this James
Your brothers have all been kilied in
action

A pause as Ryan tries to absorb this Softly

RYAN
On the level

MILLER
Fraid so

The tough paratrooper melts away replaced by the ceenage boy
who just found out that the brothers he grewup withand
loved deeplyare dead

Its certainly worth a few tears He sheds them fairly
stoically under the circumstances The others wait Some of
Ryans buddies look away feeling bad Let him get it out

He wipes his eyes finds his voice

- RYAN
You came all the way out here just to tell
me that

MILLER

(shakes his head)
Theyre sending you home We have orders
to bring you back

RYAN
Bring me back sir

Miller nods It takes Ryan a few moments to process it It
doesnt seem to make much sense to him either

RYAN (CONTD)
Thing is I have orders too And they
dont include deserting my post

MILLER
(beat)
I understand but this changes things

RYAN
I dont see that it does sir

MILLER
The Chief of Staff of the United States
Army says it does

(to all of them)
Look you guys have been hanging on by
your fingernails Why dont you all fall
back

HENDERSON
Our orders are to hold this bridge at all
coststo the last man if necessary If
all else fails as an absolute last
resort we biow it up
Miller

MILLER
Okay Why dont we just skip the middle
part and go straight to the blowing up
That way we can all get the hell out of
here

HENDERSON
Unacceptable sir Our people need this
bridge intact if at all possible

considers this turns to Ryan

MILLER
These guys want to stay fine But its
not your party anymore--

RYAN
--it damn well is--

MILLER
--it damn well isnt Now Im only saying
this once Private You grab your gear and
report within five minutes we are moving
out--

RYAN
Im afraid I ref--

MILLER
--and dont even think of trying to refuse
that order You are denied that option

RYAN
I dont think so sir

REIBEN
Hey asshole two of our people died
looking for you

RYAN

That supposed to be my fault
REIBEN

Youre goddamn right it is
MILLER

Ryan get your gear and I mean now
RYAN

No sir
MILLER

That is a direct order

RYAN
Which I am refusing sir

REIBEN
(seething)
I say we take the son of a bitch anyway

RYAN
What are you gonna do shoot me

REIBEN
There’s an idea

RYAN
Come on infantry try it

Now they have to be separated Miller gets between everybody
Both sides are overheated ready to go at it - some men are
even tensing up with weapons

Milier sees the volatility of the situation and holds up his
hands backing both sides off

MILLER
Awright Everybody count to ten

He notices Upham scared holding his M-1 at port arms
MILLER (CONTD)

Stand down you idiot These are
Americans Youre not allowed to shoot

them
Upham lowers the rifle Miller pauses taking deep breaths
calming down He regards Ryan douriy motions to him

MILLER (CONTD)
Can I have a word with you Sarge you
want to sit in on this

Ryan hesitates joins them They walk past Millers men to the
mouth of the bridge where they can talk privately Sarge
hovers just within earshot as

MILLER (CONTD)
Ive been getting people killed ever since
I set foot in this goddamn cheese-eating
country Why cant you be the exception

RYAN
Would you go
MILLER
(beat)
Absoiutely I would absolutely go

Ryan searches Millers eyesand smiles

RYAN
Youre not a very good liar sir
Miller blinks -- nobody ever accused him of that before
RYAN

Sir my mother doesn’t know that less than
five miles down the road are about a
hundred guys who are gonna get their asses
kicked if we let the Germans roll across
this bridge If she knew that I believe
she’d want me to stay put

MILLER
And is that what I’m suppposed to tell
her she gets another flag

RYAN
No sir It comes to it you can tell her
that when you found me I was with the
only brothers I had left And that there
was no way I was deserting them I think
she’d understand that

Ryan turns walks back past Millers men rejoins the
Paratroopers at the barricade Millers completely at a loss
stares off across the river Sarge moves to his side still
speaking privately

SARGE
What are vour orders sir

MILLER
Sergeant We nave crossed some strange
boundary Life has taken a turn for the
surreal

SARGE

Clearly sir But the question stands

MILLER
What do you think

SARGE
You dont really want to know sir

MILLER
Mike I really do

SARGE
From what I can see the only way the
kid’s gonna come with us is if we shoot
him but that kinda defeats the whole
purpose of the mission don’t you think

MILLER
Unless we shoot him in the leg or
something

Sarge looks at Miller

Miller
nim to

MILLER
Just a thought

turns goes back to the others Everybody waits for

speak

MILLER
How do you propose to prevent the Germans
from crossing this bridge

HENDERSON
Whats it to you sir

MILLER
Its become obvious to me that staying is
the only hope I have of keeping Private
Ryan alive

The men are stunned especially Reiben

Miller

RE
You gotta be sh

IBEN
itting me--
whirls cuts him off fiercely

MILLER
You wanted to fight the war Reiben now’s
your chance
(turns back)
Tell me the plan

HENDERSON
Weve got the machine gun emplacements you
seeplus we mined the road through
town

MILLER

Machine guns and mines Good thatll
slow ‘em down for thirty seconds what
else

(off their silence)
You think theyre gonna come at us with
donkey carts If this bridge is vital to
us you can be damn sure its vital to
them So far theyve been picking on you
with a little infantry but when they come
for real they’ll be coming with tanks
Now exactly what do we intend to do about
it

OFF THEIR LOOKS WE
CUT TO

Weapons and explosives are laid out on the ground arrayed for
inspection ANGLE UP to Miller and Sarge as

TRASK
This is everything Five thirty caliber
machine guns seventeen grenades eleven
anti-personnel mines four bazookas with
less than a dozen rounds the
flamethrower assorted M-1s and
Thompsons

RICE
Might as well be pea-shooters if they roll
on us with tanks

Everybody knows hes right Sarge notices Miller staring off
down the road that curves from sight through town

SARGE
What are you thinking sir

MILLER

Im thinking theyre gonna come rolling
right up the middle of that road and
flatten us

(points)
-unless we can disable the lead tank
therebetween those buildings Where the
rubble makes a bottleneck

RYAN
Disable him

MILLER
Yeah you know turn him into a 60 ton
roadpbiock We do that the tanks behind
him will have to leave the road and try to
get around That means plowing through
some buildings

Tall order even for tanks The others are starting to get
it to see the potential

HENDERSON
Yeah We can split ‘em up that way make
‘em more vulnerable take ‘em on while
theyre bogged down in the rubble

MILLER
»cight hit em hard one on one keep
falling back toward the bridge

SARGE
Id say three machine gun teams to pin
down their infantrytwo for
displacement number three up in the
belltower Piss a little bad news down on
their heads

MILLER
Good idea Jackson you could use some
company up there right

JACKSON

Im guessing that makes me spotter
MILLER

Well I was hoping you could cin the tail

on a few German officers for me long as
youre up there

Sackson flexes his wounded arm Miller looks for reactions

REIBEN
Its not the worst idea ever sirits
just that everything depends on knocking
out that lead tank right
(Miller nods)
How exactly do we do that

SARGE
Reibens right As our esteemed colleague
in Airborne pointed out what we got here
are peashooters So how do we stop the
tank
MILLER
Sticky bomb

That puts a pause in the conversation Everybody looks at
Miller like hes nuts

RYAN
Sticky bomb sir

HENDERSON
Youre making that up

MILLER
Its in the manual of arms you can check
it yourself

RYAN
We would sir if we had a manual of arms
handy Lacking one perhaps you could
enlighten us

MILLER
You have TNT

TOYNBE
Thats the one thing we got plenty of
Stanz and I wired the bridge with enough
combination B to blow it up twice

MILLER
Then you can spare some What you do is
you take a standard issue GI sock cram as
much TNT into it as you can rig a simple
fuse then coat the whole thing with axle
grease That way -when you throw it it
sticks Sticky bomb

(off their looks)

You think of another way to knock the
treads off a tank

Looks are traded -- no they cant

REIBEN
Great Now we gotta give up our socks

CUT TO
SEQUENCE OF BATTLE PREPARATIONS UNDER THE BRIDGE
Toynbe and Stanz are dangling in harnesses under the bridge
working on a network of ropes Theyre pulling down TNT

charges handing them across to Sanders and OToole who relay
them up to --

ON THE BRIDGE

-- Upham and Mellish who bring them to Miller and a row of
men Theres a sticky bomb assembly line happenins Sarge
stuffs a sock full of TNT hands it off to someone

SARGE
I feel like goddamn Santa Claus

CHURCH BELLTOWER

Jackson emerges from the trapdoor turns back takes his
sniper rifle as somebody hands it up Next comes a thirty
caliber machine gun CAMERA SHIFTS to the trapdoor to reveal
Parker and Weller on the ladder below relaying up ammo belts
satchels of supplies

IN THE RUBBLE

Machine Gun Team 1 consists of two Airborne troopers named
LYLE and FALLON Theyre picking a spot settling in sighting
their barrel down the street Upham appears with four ammo
belts gives them two moves on

and we follow him as he hurries through the rubble to
Machine Gun Team 2 Mellish and Henderson are positioning
their weapon inside a collapsed building angling the muzzle
through what used to be a window Mellish starts oiling the
bolt working it back and forth

MELLISH
Upham listen to me You listening When
the shit comes down well be displacing
and falling back like crazy sons of
bitches so you gotta be
Jonhnny-on-the-spot with the ammo
understand

Upham takes a deep breath nods Mellish ruffles his hair

MELLISH (CONTD)
We’re gonna xick ass

MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE

Miller strides from town with a group that includes Sarge and
Henderson checking angles of fire They stop at the first
sandbagged emplacement just past the bridge entrance

MILLER
Machine gun number four looks good right
herenot bad for a forward position

He looks out across the bridge to the emplacement at the far
end Machine gun 5

MILLER (CONTD)
That one over there Thats the Alamo
They push us back that farlast man
alive blows the bridge

TOYNBE
We got a 30 second delay on the switch
If youre that last man better get off
the bridge fast or you wont be alive for
long

The others nod grimly Ryan looks to Miller

RYAN
Where am I during all this

MILLER

Never more than two feet away from me

Thats not negotiable
ALONG THE STREET
Demolition teams are carefully hiding the anti-personnel mines
along walls behind shutters in window boxes Theyre
angiing the devices to blow out into the street on the
horizontal to take down some infantry
IN THE RUBBLE

Men are picking positions hunkering in the rubble finding
lines of sight toward the street

CHURCH BELLTOWER

Parkers got himseif a machine gun nest now muzzle aimed down
Through the balusters ANGLE TO Jackson as he sweeps his
sniper rifle up and over the balustrade targeting one end of
the street to the other eye pressed to the scope checking

freedom of movement He does it again practicing the move

SEQUENCE ENDS AS WE

INT BUILDING NEAREST THE BRIDGE - SAME

We see the bridge through one window the square through
another Miller and Ryan have just finished clearing away
some of the rubble to create a positon for themselves

Miller takes a drink from a4 canteen tosses it to Ryan then
looks out the window at the bridge His hand is shaking He
stares at it as

Ryan sits down pulls a PHOTOGRAPH from his pocket and looks
at it

RYAN
The hardest part is remembering their
faces It wasn’t all that long ago I saw
them but for some reason I can’t picture
‘em in my head anymore

RYAN
This was the last time we were all
together Two Christmases ago

He moves to show Miller the photograph wnen he sees him over
by the window staring at his hand

RYAN
You alright sir

Miller comes out of his trance looks at Ryan

MILLER
Just nerves is all

Rvan looks at Miller a moment chen

RYAN
Somehow I don’t see you as the type to get
a bout of bugs right before a fight

Miller looks back out the window
MILLER
I don’t think any man in his right mind
looks forward to a fight

RYAN
How do you get yourself ready

MILLER
I try to look at the bright side
RYAN
And does that actually work

MILLER
It has so far

RYAN
And what’s the bright side in this case
sir

MILLER

I don’t know yet

Ryan nods watches Miller a moment Then

RYAN

Is it true you were a teacher back home
MILLER

Yep
RYAN

I thought about teaching My brother’s
used to joke that I should be a priest
They said I was the type whatever that
means That I could see into people
Some ways I guess there’s not much
difference between a classroom and a
congregation

MILLER
No not much

RYAN
Two problems with being a priest though
One you can’t have a girlfriend or get
Married cr even just make out once ina
while

MILLER
That is a problem

RYAN
And two you have to believe in God And
I don’t know for sure that I do

Miller looks at Ryan

RYAN
I know for sure God’s not the one who
decides who lives or dies It’s guys like

you Or even Corporal Henderson things
got that far I don’t think God could
handle the pressure of that do you

MILLER
I don’t know

- RYAN
I guess what Im saying I were you I had
to go back home after all of this my hand
would shake too Hell my whole damn
body would shake

This gets Miller looking at Ryan now

RYAN
It’s kind of ironic you think about it

MILLER
What’s that

RYAN
You’re not afraid of the war you’re
afraid to go home

Miller considers this kid this farmboy from Iowa He shakes
his head

MILLER
You know what Ryan I think your
brothers were right You should be a
Priest
Ryan smiles nods

MILLER
Let’s see that picture

But something stops Miller He looks out the window
listening his smile fading

CHURCH BELLTOWER
As Jackson hears it too looks off in the distance
THE OTHER POSITIONS

Some of the men are starting to hear it nowtheyre pausing
listening
INT MILLER’S POSITION

As now we hear the DEEP RUMBLE OF DIESEL ENGINES comina this
way A pause a breathless hush oO

MILLER
Here they come

CHURCH BELLTOWER

Jackson and Parker are tense as hell as the RUMBLING GROWS
EVER LOUDER DIESEL FUMES are rippling over the rooftops
coming this way distorting the air with heat haze

VARIOUS ANGLES IN TOWN

As the Americans prepare Cocking weapons Sighting down
muzzles Crouching in debris Ducking past broken shutters

MILLERS POSITION

As Sarge comes in with Toynbe tosses Miller 4 pair of
binoculars Miller looks out the window--

BINOCULAR POV BELLTOWER

-- and brings Jackson into focus Jacksons peering off
through his rifle scope to see whats coming

IN THE BELLTOWER

JACKSON
Im seeing Tigers Two of ‘em

Parker relays this using hands signals -- he holds up two
fingers then makes a T with nis hands

MILLER

Has his binoculars riveted to the belltower Parker holds up
two fingers again and this time makes a P

MILLER
Two tigers Two panzers Four total

MELLISH AND HENDERSON
Are at their machine gun also watching the belltower

MELLISH
Tigers Shit It hadda be Tigers
VARIOUS ANGLES

The ground itself is starting to vibrate Bits of plaster and
debris start breaking loose drifting from the rafters

THE LEAD TANK

Looms into view around the curve of the streethuge A King
Tiger It rumbles and clanks like a prehistoric monster
treads Crushing the cobblestones to dust Riding the turret
is a haughty SS tank commander weve seen before -- Major
Hoess TANK 2 now looms into sight another Tiger On the
heels of that come TANKS 3 and 4 a pair of Panzers

Trooping along in the wake of the armor is a COMPANY OF
WEHRMACHT INFANTRY about a hundred men strong Steamboat
Willie is amona them toting a Schmeisser

CHURCH BELLTOWER

Jackson and Parker peer down as the procession passes
awesomely below It looks like really bad news from up here

JACKSON
Grant me Strength Lord

PARKER
Me too

SIX STICKY BOMB MEN

Are hidden in various positions along both sides of the
street sticky bombs ready Reiben is one of themplus
Wilson Henderson Weller Garrity Trask The bombs are gooey
and bizarre like big globs of grease with fuses

MILLERS GROUP

Toynbes got his hand on a detonator switch eyes riveted to
Miller waiting for the signal Miller has his hand poised
watcning the lead tank getcloserwaitwaitwait
mow Toynbe throws the switch --

ANGLE ON STREET

-- and thunderous hell breaks loose as the ANTI-PERSONNEL
MINES DETONATE massively along both sides of the street The

walls blow out toward the infantry taking them down with
concussion and shrapnel killing at least a dozen men

The MACHINE GUNS OPEN FIRE at the same moment turning the
street into a killing zone

MACHINE GUN 1 Lyle and Fallon are raking the street from one
direction

MACHINE GUN 2 Mellish and Henderson hammer the infantry from
another direction

MACHINE GUN 3 Parker is spraying the street from up in the
belltower raining bullets down on the Germans Jackson is
next to him drawing a snipers bead on Major Hoess

THE LEAD TANK

Major Hoess ducks down into the turret and pulls the hatch
shutjust as Jacksons bullet WHANGS off the metal Missed

the bastard The tank keeps rolling as
THE SIX STICKY BOMBERS

Swarm from the rubble on both sides of the street fuses
smoking running alongside the tank They hurl their sticky
bombs onto the treads -- then veer off and run like hell
scrambling back into the rubble trying to gain precious
seconds Tank 2 OPENS FIRE on them with its forward machine
gun Wilson is TORN BY BULLETS and goes down

WHAM-WHAM-WHAM-WHAM-WHAM-WHAM The sticky bombs DETONATE
blowing gouts of flame sideways over both sides of the street
and for an unnerving moment or two we figure nothing happened
because the tank just keeps going ---- but then the tread rips
aDart on one side throwing up massive steel links The tank
skids slewing to one side wheels spinning It stops tries
going in reverse -- but that throws even more tread off

The lead tank just became a 60 ton roadblock (though still
able to fire) The other tanks jam up behind slamming on
their brakes

INSIDE THE TANKS

TANK CREWS are shouting looking for targets trying to find a
way around A VOICE cuts through the noise on the radio

HOESS
(filtered on radio)
Drent die Kanonen um

THE THREE REAR TANKS

Start backing up still FIRING as they go Stanz rears from
the rubble with a bazooka FIRES at Tank 2 The projectile
WHOOSHES deflects off the turret EXPLODES against the
building opposite -- and the building collapses dropping a
ton of wall down on the tank Tank 2 lurches keeps backing
up getting ciear of the debris Muzzle cranking this way
Still operational Stanz runs for it WHUMP The EXPLOSION is
stunning We dont even see what happened to Stanz

The tanks lurch forward and veer off in various directions
leaving the road and heading through the rubble

MILLER
Sees it happening shouts to the others

MILLER
Lets go

They use rags to pick up the machine gun -- the barrels hot
enough to char the cloth They fall back to another spot

UPHAM

the world gets shot to pieces around him He comes to Mellish

IN THE RUBBLE

Milier appears flattens against a wall Here comes Tank 3 a
Panzer plowing through what used to be somebodys living room
in an eruption of shattering plaster and lathe

The tank reaches a stone wall and bogs down grinding against
rock struggling to get through Miller turns motions -- Rice

and Sanders race past him with sticky bombs bobbing througn
the rubble Ryan tries to go ts0 but

MILLER
Not you

Ryan wants o argue but they see German infantry coming They
OPEN FIRE tc cover Sanders and Rice pinning the Germans
down

The tank is maneuvering grinding moments from battering
through Sanders and Rice come running and ducking They pause
at the tank get the fuses going ---- and one of the sticky
bombs DETONATES PREMATURELY Sanders and Rice literaily
VAPORIZE The BLAST knocks over walls and slams Miller and
Ryan to the ground

They roll over stunned and horrifiedas the Panzer grinds
on unharmed OO

THE BATTLE

Rages on in the rubble The German infantry is swarming
FIRING pushing forward by inches or yards

The machine gun teams are HAMMERING AWAY at them displacing
falling back hammering away again Upham is shuttling ammo to
both teams running like crazy through the rubble

Trask surprises a SQUAD OF ADVANCING GERMANS with the
FLAMETHROWER hosing a stunning stream of fire through the
rubble setting men afire in a hell of mushrooming smoke
The tanks keep plowing inexorably along battering their way
through turrets swiveling picking targets FIRING and taking
down obstacles in their path almost at random

ANGLE ON TANK 4

and run iike nell --WHAM-WHAM-WHAM-WHAM The sticky bombs

shoot GOUTS OF FLAME xnocking Reiben nead-over-hneels into the
rubble -

He rises on his elbows dazed crying to clear his head He
turns roils over to look at the tank ---- and is horrified to
see it come through unharmed still rolling It swerves toward
him he scrambies desperately Trying to get out of its path
but his neads still spinning and hes not going to make it
--Abazooka srojectile WHOOSHES up the tanks ass and blows
out the engine The tank stutters and hitches groans to a
stop

Reiben looks past the tank -- and sees Stanz about twenty
yards back Stanz is filthy covered with soot percned on
some rubble with a smoking bazooka in his hands Their eyes
meet for a moment -- Stanz gives him a shy little smile -- anc
then hes gone ducking out of sight like a ferret

The turret hatch lifts A PANZER CREWMAN pops up with a Luger
shoots Toynbe dead He turns sees Reiben aimsand a BULLET
BLOWS through the crewmans chest killing him instantiv

Reiben looks around realizes the shot came from

Jackson just saved Reibens ass He works his rifle bolt and
turns away scanning for other targets

IN ANOTHER AREA

Tank 2 the other Tiger comes awesomely through a wall
ramping up and slamming back down again

»as Miller and Ryan come running ducking past shattered
walls They find Sarge and Garrity lying in wait for the tank
Garrity has a bazooka aimed

path Both men freeze staring at each other

The world stops for a heartbeat of time Both men frozen

They both swing their weapons up simultaneously The German is
faster -- BRRAAAAAAAP Mellish is driven back as BULLETS SLAM
a bloody pattern into his stomach He goes down hard dead
before he even hits the ground

The German spins turning his Schmeisser on Upham -- but Upham

into the German soidier’s chest as he arcs back into the
rubble FIRING A BURST at the sky

Upham stares at the two dead men in shock Reiben appears at

REIBEN
Cmon Upham we gotta fall back

Upham is slow to move Reiben pulls him along FIRING his
BAR to cover their retreat

AREA LEADING TO SQUARE

Miller comes zig-zagging through the rubble with Ryan and
Sarge heading for the square

and here comes the Tiger bashing through Trask hits it
with the FLAMETHROWER FIRE AND SMOKE mushroom skyward Trask
hits the trigger again -- and runs out of fuel He frantically
shrugs out of the harness turns runs for his life

IN THE SQUARE

The surviving soldiers race into the square -- Miller Ryan
Sarge Trask Reibden and Upham appear too everybody heading
for the bridge

Weliers already there in the forward sandbag emplacement
racking the boit of the machine gun

The Tiger BLOWS THROUGH A WALL with its cannon-and comes
thundering into the square treads grinding through a massive
turn The forwarc MACHINE GUN OPENS FIRE swiveling tracking
the runners

THE RUNNERS

but everybody else makes it to the emplacement throwing
themselves over as INCOMING MACHINE GUN FIRE rips the
sandbags

The Panzer enters down at the other end of the square Both
tanks closing in now backed by some infantry

Weller OPENS FIRE with the machine gun Ryan snatches up 4
bazooka lays it over the lip aims for the Tiger Miller
loads pounds him on the helmet Ryan FIRES The projectile
EXPLODES ineffectually off the treads

RYAN
Reload
SARGE
Well take it You fall back
Sarge gives Miller a look -- go get him back there
MILLER

You be right behind us

SARGE
Count on it

Ryan and Miller grab whatever they can leaving the forward
emplacement and racing across the bridge

Sarge levels the bazooka over the sandbags Reiben loads
pounds his shoulder Sarge FIRES This one also EXPLODES with
no effect Both tanks keep coming

SARGE
FALL BACK

They bail out in a big-ass hurry grabbing whatever they can
and running for it Weller stays on the machine gun BLASTING
AWAY to provide some cover

THE TIGER

Swivels its muzzie toward the emplacement

WELLER

Abandons the machine gun running after the others The
forward emplacement ZIXPLODES in a swirling ball of flame
sandbags and debris Welier is caught by the blast and
thrown dying as he siams off the pavement

THE LAST SANDBAG EMPLACEMENT

At the far end of the bridge The Alamo Ryan and Miller come
running and throw themselves over the sandbags Miller grabs

the last bazooka hollers to Ryan

MILLER
Connect those wires
Miller lays the bazooka over the sandbags Waiting for the
first tank

Behind him Ryan frantically connects the wires to the
detonator spinning the wingnuts

Sarge and the others are running up the bridge toward us
Behind them the Tiger lumbers hugely into view

MILLER
RUN

The Tigers forward MACHINE GUN OPENS FIRE ripping bullets up
the pavement The runners throw themselves in all directions
for whatever cover they can find Trask is hit in the leg and
goes down Sarge grabs him drags him behind a buttress --

MILLER
DOWN

-- as Miller FIRES THE BAZOOKA The projectile rips down the
length of bridge past the men and EXPLODES against the front
of the Tiger No effect Miller desperately reloads as --

SARGE
GO GO

-- the men keep running dragging Trask along the ground The

tanks machine gun OPENS FIRE AGAIN Sarge is hit in the back
and coes down

REIBEN
SARGE

MILLER
GODDAMN IT

Miller FIRES THE BAZOOKA AGAIN The last round It EXPLODES
off the tank as harmlessly as the others

Reiben and Upham jump to their feet now dragging two wounded
men going all out

and then the Tiger FIRES ITS CANNON THE EXPLOSION TEARS
THE WORLD APART spinning it upside-down ripping the air with
heat and shrapnel

and everything goes quiet as if the sound has drained out

of the world Were left with sounds that are remote faint
surreal disembodied

SLOW MOTION SEQUENCE

--as we find Sarge dead through swirling dust Somebody crawis
to him -- its Upham dazed and disoriented glasses cracked
He looks over and sees Reiben througn a swirl of haze and
smoke using a bridge buttress for cover one side of his face
blackened Hes motioning -- cmon get off the middle of the
bridge for Gods sakes Upham looks back sees

THE MUZZLE OF THE TANK

Emerging from the smoke with a surreal howl

UPHAM

Starts crawling trying to get to Reiben

THE SANDBAGGED EMPLACEMENT

Is a tumbled mess everything strewn and smoking Ryan and
Miller rise into view battered and stunned hearing the tank
coming a bizarre animalistic howl echoes faintly up the
bridge They reach for the toppled 30 caliber machine gun
REIBEN

Reaches out grabs Uphams hand pulls him in They cling
together huddling behind the buttress

RYAN AND MILLER

Slam the machine gun atop the sandbags Ryan works the bolt (a
sound we do hear a big echoing CLACK-CLATCH) and OPENS FIRE

The muzzle blast of the machine gun is silent all we hear is
the bolt wnacking back and forth the shells ejecting with a
faint metallic shriek

THE TIGER TANK

Fills the screen It lets off a bizarre howl more animalistic
than ever I£ you closed your eyes you could picture it with

Teeth and claws

MILLER

Watches the monster approach sees
THE TANKS FORWARD MACHINE GUN
Swiveling taking aim

MILLER

Throws his arms over Ryan shoving him down out of the path of
the bullets -
STEAMBOAT WILLIE

Appears running beside the tank sees the two figures behind
the sandbag and quickly fires his Schmeisser-

and Miller takes several rounds in the chest They fall from
sight together

REIBEN AND UPHAM

See Miller go down soundlessly screaming his name
STEAMBOAT WILLIE

Then runs for cover unaware of who he’s just shot as
MILLER

Rises up woundedplaying out the final grueling inevitable
momentsmovingin a litany of painraising his 45
automaticthe only weapon left to him

-firingone round after anotherknowing the futility but
pumping the trigger anywaypistol jumping soundlessly in his
fistrunning the magazine down to the final round

--he FIRES the final bullet

«and sees the Tiger EXPLODE MASSIVE GOUTS OF FLAME blow
soundlessiy over the sides of the bridge -- and a SECONDARY
EXPLOSION blasts the Tigers turret up into the air like a
flaming pinwheel it slams off the side of the bridge taking

a chunk with it crashing hugely into the water

-Miller stares slack in amazementlooks at the pistol in
his handwondering for a brief moment if such a thing is
even possible

--and then he starts to hear them He gazes up Here they
come descending like voices from above building to a choral
crescendo

RESUME NORMAL SPEED AND SOUND

aS a pair of P-51 MUSTANGS swoop grandly over the bridge

Tank-busters They peel overhead no longer with the sound of
voices but with a THROATY ROAR OF PACKARD ENGINES

REIBEN AND UPHAM

See the planes coming around for another pass The Panzer is

Desperately trying to back off the bridge as the Tiger burns
Reiben and Upham come limpingrunning up the bridge

-and find Miller dying in Ryans arms

REIBEN
-Captainoh god

They drop to their knees grabbing onto Miller as if that
simple gesture might keep him alive anguish bursting like a
dam Reiben screams at the sky Upham breaks down in tears

Down at the far end of the bridge the Panzer DETONATES with a
superheated ball of flame Both tanks destroyed The Mustangs
ROAR past rising up into a steep climb

MILLER

Is staring at the clouds unable to speak He raises a bloody
hand pointing up Ryan follows the gesture looks up to see

THE P-Sls Climbing together damn near vertical straining
magnificently at the apex of their climb

MILLER
Is trying to speak Tears are streaming down Ryans face

RYAN
Theyre tank-busters sir P-Sls

Milier may not have heard him His breath is leaving his
body

MILLERS POV - RYAN
Backlit against the bright sky The face of

MILLER
-angelson our shoulders

His hand flails us shaking Ryan catches it It stops
shaking And the two men lock eyes

RYAN
-the bright side sir
(then)
You’ re a teacher again

Miller stares up at Ryan Holds onto his hand as we

DISSOLVE TO LONG LENS OF BRIDGE

Ryan Reiben and Upham sit with Millers body smoke drifting
gently across the river The first of the Sherman tanks
appear bg from the treeline coming toward the bridge with
waves of supporting infantry as we then again

DISSOLVE TO CLOSE-UP OF THE OLD MAN
Tears streaming down his face

VOICES
Grampa

EXT - ALLIED CEMETERY AT NORMANDY - PRESENT DAY

The old man is staring at a grave marker with tears streaming
down his face He wipes his face composes himself as now we
see A LITTLE BOY come over the rise followed by three more
CHILDREN and then a MAN and a WOMAN

OLD MAN
I have my family with me My son and his
wifemy grandkids I have a daughter in
Seattle Shes got a family too All
good people Im sorry you couldnt have
known them

LITTLE BOY
Grampa

The old man turns looks back A short distance away stands
the little boy and a moment later the rest of the family
The old man motions for them to wait He turns back to the
gravestone the tears still coming An intense swirl of
emoticns on his face Softly

OLD MAN
I want to thank you not just for my life
but for all of theirs And to tell you
that I-- that we’ve all tried the best we
could to earn what you did for us That
we’ll never forget

The old man stands a moment longer then gives the gravestone
a heartfeit salute He turns and then goes to his family as

CAMERA COMES AROUND on the grave marker which bears the name

Captain John Miller It sits silently as it has for over
fifty years in this well-tended place
