BLOOD WORK

EXT CRIME SCENE (SILVERLAKE) - NIGHT

A media and spectator circus Two cocky LAPD detectives
ARRANGO and WALTERS watch as FBI profiler TERRY McCALEB
strides past the police barricades Wearing a blue FBI
jacket the hoary veteran ignores questions shouted out
by the press The words Code Killer feature
prominently

ARRANGO
(disparaging)
McCaleb Whatever happens it’s
his face on the front page

As McCaleb reaches Arrango

McCALEB
What do you got

ARRANGO
Fucking hemorrhoids What are you
gonna do about it

Arrango’s itching for trouble Walters is a cooler head

WALTERS
Victims five and six The code
killer strikes again

INT TENEMENT - ENTRY HALLWAY - NIGHT

A dingy dark place Police work lights can’t quite cut
the gloom McCaleb stops at the door with Walters and
Arrango The door is half off its hinges

WALTERS
Neighbor came over to complain
about the noise Got run over at
the door Didn’t see a thing

ARRANGO
We’re calling him Chuck Taylor

McCALEB
Hows that

Arrango points out a series of bloody sneaker prints on
the floor Headed for the door and away down the hall

ARRANGO
Converse hi-tops Chuck Taylor
Get it

A look and McCaleb continues in past them
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Not for the faint of heart There are several darkened
forms on the floor Heavy black plastic bags An
investigative team works

WALTERS
We got the remains of two maybe
even three people

ARRANGO
Gives new meaning to the term gang
bang

Gruff desensitized laughs from the cops Walters
motions McCaleb to a wall There written in blood

McCaleb Catch me if you can 903 472 568

Arrango winks at his partner then to McCaleb

ARRANGO
Another love note The two of you
should get a room some place

As McCaleb stares grimly

EXT CRIME SCENE (DOWNTOWN) - NIGHT

McCaleb exits The crowd has doubled A NEWS CREW
bursts past the barricade Police rush to block them
but to no avail They nearly ring McCaleb

REPORTERS
Was another message left for you
Agent McCaleb -- Why do you
think the killer has picked
you -- What do the numbers
mean

McCaleb scans the sea of humanity before him Not
exactly its best face With a sigh McCaleb starts to
make his way through then stops short Ahead

FACE IN CROWD
Seen for an instant Wearing a hooded sweatshirt and

low-billed cap Staring at McCaleb an odd look in his
eye
BACK TO SCENE 6

A beat before McCaleb looks downward THROUGH a thicket
of legs we spot his feet Covering them are bloody
Converse hi-tops Chuck Taylor McCaleb looks over but
the cops seem suddenly so far away Hi-Top begins to
drift back

McCALEB
(toward cops)
Hey Hey Over here

Hi-Top turns and goes suddenly swallowed up by the
crowd

McCALEB
(to no avail)
He’s over here

No one listens The Reporters continue to fire

questions Hi-Top is getting away McCaleb fights his
way through charges down the street after him

STREET 7
Running now his face unclear as high-top looks back over
his shoulder sees that McCaleb is chasing him

NARROW ALLEY 8
Hi-Top cuts down McCaleb closes

At the end of the alley an eight feet redwood fence
Hi-Top jumps catches hold As he pulls himself up
McCaleb hits the fence right behind him

The fence collapses The two men sprawl to the ground
Hi-Top gets up scoots away McCaleb rolls to his feet
the chase is back on

BACK YARDS 9
One after the next Fences are scaled kicked through
And McCaleb closes All we hear are the FOOTFALLS the
RAGGED BREATHS of the two men

Then a HEARTBEAT

McCaleb reaches for Hi-Top’s shoulder inches away now

A chain link fence looms ahead Hi-Top leaps onto it
catches hold As he pulls himself up McCaleb is right
behind He catches hold of one of Hi-Top’s legs

9

Hi-Top grips the top of the fence rears back with his
free leg and kicks McCaleb in the face McCaleb drops

Hi-Top is up and over dropping to the other side An
alley behind some businesses

McCaleb gets to his feet one of Hi-Top’s bloody sneakers
in his hands He starts to climb the fence

The HEARTBEAT INTENSIFIES McCaleb pauses at the top of
the fence slides back down the way he came He clutches
at his left arm a look of surprise on his face

The heartbeat eclipses all else McCaleb is having a
heart attack He grips the fence to keep from falling

CHAIN LINK 10

Suddenly through the pain McCaleb is aware of a form in
the gloom We don’t see his face but fascinated
Hi-Top has come back to watch

McCaleb reaches into his jacket seemingly for his chest
But when his hand comes back out he’s holding his 38
service revolver Blinking against near blinding pain
he aims through the fence

Hi-Top runs for the dark as ROUND AFTER ROUND EXPLODES

The fourth sends him sprawling The fifth and sixth sail
wide as Hi-Top stands and staggers into blackness

McCALEB 11
Suddenly illuminated by a spotlight The revolver slips
from his hand as the pain overwhelms him Bleached

white he falls back into the dirt his eyes wide

As he stares up at a silent hovering LAPD helicopter he
mouths words we cannot understand And as the HEARTBEAT
BECOMES an ELECTRONIC BLIP

and ghostly The snaking line of a scope moves toward

INT CEDARS-SINAI HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 13

On a gurney his oddly-angled head in a brace McCaleb
closes his eyes as the line enters his heart

The voice belongs to DR BONNIE FOX the cardiologist who
guides the line through an incision in McCaleb’s neck

DR FOX
Coming out Terry You did good

Removing the scope she tapes a gauze compress to his
neck As she unstraps the brace McCaleb rubs his neck
He looks less than formidable in his hospital johnny

DR FOX
Been taking your pills every day

McCALEB
All thirty-four of them

DR FOX
No fever at all

McCALEB
No I’m clean

DR FOX
And no diarrhea

McCALEB

DR FOX
Good Blood pressure and pulse

McCALEB
Right on target

DR FOX

too hard on it

McCALEB
I’m keeping it afloat That’s
all

DR FOX

Good I’11 see you ina bit I

want to check the blood work and

get the tissue over to the lab
As Dr Fox heads out

CUT TO

INT CEDARS - HALLWAY - CARDIOLOGY UNIT - DAY 14

An orderly wheels McCaleb’s gurney down the hall As
they pass one room McCaleb looks over

A young boy is on the bed his body tied by tubes to a
heart lung machine A man in a suit his father sits at
the foot of the bed As his eyes drift out into the hall
at McCaleb
McCaleb looks away

DISSOLVE TO

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - ON ISSUE OF BOAT RESTORATION 15
MAGAZINE

McCaleb reads it in his hospital room He looks up as
Dr Fox comes through the door holding a lab report

DR FOX
Don’t start running laps yet but
I’m very pleased No rejection
all the levels look good I might
lower your Prednisone in another
week

McCALEB
Good I’m tired of shaving three
times a day

Dr Fox smiles warms a stethoscope with her breath

DR FOX
Lean forward please

He leans forward She pulls down his johnny listens to
his heart through his back

McCALEB
Can I ask you something

DR FOX
Don’t talk
(a beat)
Sit up

She listens through his chest For the first time we see
it the thirteen-inch white scar running over his heart
like a rope McCaleb half-grimaces at nothing in
particular Finally she’s done

DR FOX
Good What did you want to ask
me

15 15

McCALEB
That boy in room 604 What’s his
blood type

Dr Fox studies him a beat

DR FOX
It’s different than yours if
that’s what you want to know

McCALEB
How long has he been waiting

DR FOX
About half as long as you did

McCALEB
What are his chances

DR FOX
Maybe fifty-fifty Maybe less
What’s bothering you Terry

McCALEB

(after a beat)
When I was with the bureau we had
to qualify on the range every
year You know shoot targets
Circle around the heart scores
more than the head It’s called
the ten ring Highest score

Dr Fox smiles sympathetically Familiar ground to her

DR FOX
Typical You hang around almost
two years waiting for a heart
draw your string out and nearly
don’t make it and now you wonder
if we should’ve given it to you
You know what that is

McCALEB
Bullshit

DR FOX
Exactly Go home and enjoy your
boat I’11 see you next week

17 THE FOLLOWING SEA 17
The woman -- GRACIELLA RIVERS -- stares out across the
water She doesn’t see McCaleb till he’s stepping down
aboard

McCALEB
Can I help you

She turns a little startled

GRACIELLA
I’m looking for Terrel McCaleb

McCALEB
You found him

17

GRACIELLA
I read about you in the paper Mr
McCaleb ‘The Where Are They
Now’ column You know in the
Metro section

McCALEB

Look before you start your story
I have to tell you you’re not the
first person to come out here and
find me

(off no answer

she looks sad)
I can recommend a good private
investigator Someone who’1l work
hard and won’t rip you off

GRACIELLA
The article said you were good
It said you hated it whenever
somebody got away

McCALEB
If you read the article then you
also know what happened to me
I’m retired Miss Rivers

GRACIELLA
Graciella I think you could help
me Maybe help yourself too

McCALEB
I don’t need the money

GRACIELLA
I’m not talking about money

Something weird about how she said it Graciella reaches
into her purse hands McCaleb a photo a smiling woman
watching a boy blow out seven candles on a birthday cake
The woman looks quite a bit like Graciella

He looks at it looks back at her

McCALEB
Your sister

GRACIELLA

McCALEB
Which one

17 17

GRACIELLA
Excuse me

McCALEB
Which one is dead

GRACIELLA
My sister Gloria Torres Glory
Her son’s name is Raymond

McCaleb holds the photo out sighs

McCALEB
Look Miss Rivers I just can’t do
this I’m sorry

She makes no move to take the photo

GRACIELLA
Look at it again Please Just
one more time and then I’11 leave
you alone Tell me if you feel
anything

McCALEB
(irritated)
I was an FBI agent not a
psychic Now do you want this
photo back or not

GRACIELLA
I have a double You know two
for the price of one You’11 want
to keep that one

McCALEB
Why would I want to do that

Graciella reaches out her hand Past the photo McCaleb
still holds out She places the palm of her hand on his
chest runs it slowly down the front of his shirt her
fingers tracing the scar beneath

GRACIELLA
Your heart It was my sister’s
(a beat)

My phone number’s on the back if
you change your mind

With that Graciella steps up to the dock and starts
away Speechless McCaleb watches her go then turns
over the photo A number is scrawled on back

McCALEB
I don’t have a license if that’s
what you mean

Arrango glares at him a beat

ARRANGO
Jesus it’s stuffy in here

Arrango gets up adjusts a thermostat on the wall and
goes back for his seat As he does McCaleb glances up
at an air duct grill over the door

ARRANGO
You say you’re conducting an
investigation into the Gloria
Torres homicide is that correct

McCALEB
(sighs)
Yes that’s right

ARRANGO
And you have no license in the
state of California to operate as
a private investigator true

McCALEB
True

Walters enters Without looking Arrango signals him not
to interrupt Walters leans against the wall

ARRANGO
Do you understand Mr McCaleb
that it is a crime in this state
to operate as a private
investigator without a license

McCALEB
Can we skip the bullshit and turn
off the tape and camera and just
talk a minute Besides Walters
is leaning against the microphone
Youre not picking anything up

Arrango turns as Walters jumps away from the wall

WALTERS
Why didn’t you tell me

ARRANGO
Shuddup

McCALEB
Have a doughnut guys I’m here
to help

ARRANGO

How do you know Graciella Rivers 26

McCALEB
She’s an acquaintance She asked
me to look into this

McCaleb opens the box of doughnuts Walters looks to
Arrango whose face is stone

McCALEB
Well I’m going to have one

McCaleb takes out a cinnamon After a beat Walters
grabs a glazed Finally against his better judgment
Arrango takes a powdered They each chew a moment

ARRANGO
I don’t know what the sister told
you Mr Former-FB1I-profiler
but this isn’t Charlie Manson or
Ted fucking Bundy It’s a
convenience store robbery Some
mope with a mask and a gun and the
right ratio of balls to brains
That’s all

McCALEB
I know but I told her I’d check
it out It’s been two months I

thought maybe you guys wouldn’t
mind a fresh set of eyes

Walters looks at Arrango shrugs a why not

McCALEB
I’m not here to show you up
Anything I come up with you’1l be
the first to know

ARRANGO
What do you want

McCALEB
Copy me the murder book and the
video walk-through on the crime
scene I was always good with
crime scenes

Walters and Arrango exchange another look Then

ARRANGO
I don’t think so man

McCALEB
Let me ask you something does the
sister call you much 26

ARRANGO
All the time Week in and week
out I tell her the same thing No
suspects no leads

McCALEB
This could get her off your case
If I see what you got and say you
boys did your best she might back
off

Arrango smiles at the thought of that

ARRANGO
You say you were good with crime
scenes

McCALEB

Yeah if you made a tape
Arrango winks at Walters then looks back at McCaleb
ARRANGO

We got better than a crime scene
tape We got the crime

(stands)
Come on Bring those doughnuts
with you
INT LIEUTENANT’S OFFICE - TELEVISION SCREEN - DAY 27

The screen flickers on A black and white surveillance
camera view of the counter of a convenience store A
date and time line runs across the bottom of the screen
The frame is empty a few seconds until the counterman
leans in over the register He breaks open a roll of
quarters

WALTERS
That’s Kyungwon Kang the owner

ARRANGO
He’s spending his last few seconds
on the planet here

As he closes the register a woman steps up Easily
recognizable from the photo -- Gloria Torres Glory
She smiles as she sets a Hershey bar down on the counter

ARRANGO
Came in to buy a fucking candy
bar You believe that

27

McCALEB
(softly)
For her son

As Gloria hands a dollar bill over a man in a black ski
mask and black jumpsuit moves up behind Gloria

She’s still smiling as ski mask puts his right hand on
her right shoulder and in one continuous move brings the
muzzle of a handgun up to her left temple

Without hesitation he pulls the trigger

ARRANGO
Badda-bing

McCaleb grimaces as bloody mist jettisons from the wound

Ski mask holds her up as a shield then raises his left
hand to FIRE a ROUND into Mr Kang Kang vainly grapples
for a hold on the counter like a man going over a cliff

Ski mask lowers Gloria’s body to the floor Her head
drops out of sight

Ski mask steps up as Mr Kang pulls a revolver from under
some papers bags Ski mask shoots him in the face

Ski mask scoops the cash from the register then picks up
something off Mr Kang’s arm He then reaches for
something on the floor

WALTERS
He picked up all the shells

Ski mask looks directly at the camera and says something

McCALEB
No sound on the camera right

WALTERS
Right Whatever he said there he
said to himself

Ski mask then makes one last pass on his way out
ARRANGO
You ain’t gonna see that on
‘America’s Favorite Home Videos’
McCALEB
(ignoring comment)

Can I see it again Slowed down

27 27

ARRANGO
It’s not over yet

McCALEB
What

ARRANGO
The good Samaritan comes in now

On screen a dark-haired dark-complected man in jeans
and a T-shirt enters He hesitates looks down at
Gloria then over the counter at Mr Kang He kneels
over Gloria’s body Almost immediately he’s up and
away

ARRANGO
He went down the aisles looking
for bandages He actually wrapped
her head with tape and paper
towels

The good Samaritan is back doing just that

ARRANGO
Camera never got a good look at
him After he finished he went
outside called 9-1-1 and split

WALTERS
Voice on the tape was Latino We
figure the guy was illegal
Afraid to stick around

McCALEB
Too bad He was there so soon he
probably saw the shooter’s car
maybe the shooter

WALTERS
We put out flyers went on Channel
34 Nothing

McCALEB
(re TV)
May I

Arrango shrugs annoyed

McCaleb rewinds starts the tape again This time in
slow motion As the gun gets pressed up against Gloria
Torres’ head he freezes it The smile has only half-
left her 27

Arrango smirks as McCaleb scribbles the time 224139
McCaleb hesitates before resuming play

ARRANGO
Pause button’s not gonna help her
now

McCaleb hits it Gloria dies The tape plays through
ski mask saying something into the camera

McCALEB
He winked

WALTERS
What

McCaleb rewinds plays it slower As ski mask says his
line he definitely winks

McCaleb freezes it again as the good Samaritan walks in
He notes the new time line 224255 As the tape
finishes McCaleb is visibly affected

ARRANGO
Okay Mr FBI man tell us
something we don’t know

McCaleb stares over at Arrango hardens up

McCALEB
The shooter’s been in the store
before He knew where the camera
was So he’s either from the
neighborhood or he cased the
place Plus this wasn’t the first
time No hesitation no panic he
picks up the brass This guy’s
done it before

Arrango and Walters exchange a look Walters starts to
say something but Arrango holds up a hand to silence
him

McCALEB
What

Neither man answers

McCALEB
How many others

Neither man answers again

27 27

McCALEB
Can I see the murder book

ARRANGO
Let us talk to the lieutenant and
we’ll get back to you

Arrango and Walters both stand Meeting over

McCALEB
When

ARRANGO
Give me a number We’1l be in
touch

That’s all he’s getting Taking out a pen McCaleb
writes a number on the top of the doughnut box He
shoves it in Arrango’s hands gives Walters a nasty look
then starts out with Arrango calling after him

ARRANGO
Hey we don’t need your shit
McCaleb we got a whole plateful
of our own

down

As the Asian Woman RINGS it up McCaleb looks up at the
surveillance camera He then hands the woman a dollar

29

McCALEB
Are you Mrs Kang

ASIAN WOMAN
Yes I know you

McCALEB
No it’s just I heard what
happened here To your husband
I’m sorry

ASIAN WOMAN
Yes thank you
(a beat)
The only way to keep evil out is
to not unlock door We can’t do
that We must have business

McCaleb nods that he understands As she hands him his
change he looks one more time at the surveillance
camera then once behind him Playing the crime over in
his head
As he exits he nods to Mrs Kang
McCALEB

you know this

McCALEB
Her sister tracked me down She
read a piece about me in the
paper about the fact that I hada
rare blood type the same as her
sister’s My surgery was the same
day her sister died

DR FOX
What does she want Money

McCaleb actually laughs

DR FOX
I’m glad you can find it funny

McCALEB
Don’t you see She wants me to
find out who did it She wants me
to solve her sister’s murder

leading to a fatal head injury
This is different

How How is it different A
heart is a heart

McCALEB

An accident is fate A murder is
evil

DR FOX
Oh please --

This gift that you talk about the
only reason I have it is because
of this evil hateful thing that
someone did

You’re not making a lot of sense

would go friends she would see

she ever mention a James Cordell

to you

No

You’re sure

It’s too premature to get into
right now

GRACIELLA

You think this James Cordell
killed her 59

McCALEB
No

GRACIELLA
Then what

McCALEB
Cordell was killed during an
ATM hold-up six weeks before
Gloria It looks like the same
gunman

GRACIELLA
So why would Gloria know him
They were both just in the wrong
place at the wrong time right

McCALEB
It’s a hunch but this
investigation was run under the
theory that the locations were
chosen and the victims were
random I think it might be the
other way around

GRACIELLA
What

McCALEB
To check it out I need to see if
your sister and Cordell had
anything in common Some
intersection that hooks them to
each other or to the gunman

GRACIELLA
I’m not following you

McCALEB
In the bureau we had what we call
a full field investigation
That’s all I’m doing

First of all I’m sorry I know
it doesn’t matter what a stranger
thinks but you have my sympathy
From what I read in the file
James was a good man

Torres may have crossed the

He points to the ground between two trash bins Bolotov
sits there slumped the side of his head blown open

Walters holds up an evidence bag a 9mm pistol inside

into his pocket for two more evidence bags One holds
sunglasses the other a crucifix earring

Give me the tweezers There’s
something between his teeth

The detectives turn as the tweezers fish out

It’s a bullet

Indeed a partially flattened slug

FORENSICS 2
That looks like a 38 to me

As Forensics One nods in agreement

JAYE
Why would he put a 38 slug in his
mouth

McCALEB

Same reason he died on the

it Someone’s jerking us off

way So I don’t care about your
feelings You’re an asshole and
that’s fine but I’m not backing
out till we get this guy

McCALEB
What’s the ’D’ mean Deceased

DR FOX
No The ’D’ means donor Organ
donor They were both organ
donors

The words hang heavy in the air

McCALEB
That’s why they were killed
Cordell died on the scene but
Gloria made it long enough

Dr Fox follows his reasoning She’s stunned

DR FOX
That’s crazy

I made a judgement I decided
your sister didn’t have anything
anyone would want so the reason
had to be elsewhere I missed it

Missed what McCaleb

Before McCaleb can answer Dr Fox does

DR FOX
Her blood It made her unique
It made what was inside her very
valuable to someone

benefitted could be a suspect

went through the frontal lobe

JAYE
Great timing I just came down
here to see you

Jaye stops short as she sees McCaleb looks like he just
got back from World War III

JAYE
Are you okay

McCALEB
Haven’t felt this good in years
(stands)
What can I do for you Jaye

JAYE
I’‘1l give you three guesses They
all start with Code Killer

McCALEB
And

JAYE
I thought I’d pick your brain
Where do you think he is

McCALEB
In the wind I guess

Jaye studies him a moment She then looks to The
Following Sea THROUGH the salon door she can see
Graciella holding Raymond They’ve been through the
wringer

JAYE
The two of them okay

145

McCALEB
They will be if everyone leaves
them alone The best thing that
could happen to them is if this
Code Killer just disappeared

JAYE
I don’t know The wind doesn’t
blow forever He’s got to come
down some time

McCaleb looks away from her and out to the sea Jaye
follows his gaze

McCALEB
Hope so

Jaye’s not stupid she knows something
JAYE
There’s blood all over the dock

back there And on your shirt

The two of them look at each other again and in that
moment a silent transmission and understanding

JAYE
Must’ve been a big fish

Finally Jaye looks back to Graciella and Raymond
JAYE
It’s none of my business but how
are you going to deal with this
McCALEB
I have Gloria Torres’ heart I’m

thinking it might guide me
