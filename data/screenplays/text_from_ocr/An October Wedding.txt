INT WHITMAN HOUSE - LIBRARY - SUNSET

TIME CARD 3 Years Ago

A modern empty reading room

Autumnal light falls on dusty bookshelves

A large window frames a back yard by the woods

A table sits out back with streamers twisting in the wind
Voices SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY from just around the corner and--

We do not cut away
We do not move outside
We are trapped here for one long take

OUTSIDE in the window parents carry a cake to the table
They look around Walk away Searching

CORA (0OS)
Joan Joan where are you

INSIDE JOAN WHITMAN (20s) slinks out of the curtains
Bright-eyed Bookish A shrinking violet about to bloom
In a modern shirt-dress with RUNIC TATTOOS on each wrist
She hides under a desk holding a small GLOBE

She spins the globe Taps on it

The door OPENS

CORA (0OS)
There you are

Her sister CORA LEE WHITMAN (20s) walks in
Outgoing Athletic A sunflower in summertime
Same modern shirt-dress Same runic tattoos

CORA

Ive been looking all over for--
JOAN

You didnt find me Im not here

Go away

Joan spins the globe Taps on it again Sulking
Cora shuts the door and sits with her

CORA
Wheres the globe sending you today

JOAN

CORA

JOAN
Only if you can keep up As soon as I
get off the plane Im climbing the
Matterhorn

CORA

And go get Swiss hot chocolate

JOAN

Cora puts her head on Joans shoulder
Joan smiles

While OUTSIDE

In the window behind them

The woods move Something is coming

JOAN

deed to the homestead arent they

CORA
Yes They are

JOAN

Cora goes to speak-- then pulls out a gift-wrapped BOX

CORA

JOAN

CORA

Joan opens it as

OUTSIDE

In the window

In the distance

A row of cloaked figures emerges from the woods
Red robes identical white masks watching

INSIDE Joan opens the box to find a DSLR camera
JOAN
Oh my gods How did you--

CORA
For our trip to Switzerland

JOAN
But I was just talking were not

CORA

CORA

Elders and theyre going to--

AUGUSTUS (0S)
Theres my birthday girl

AUGUSTUS and OCTAVIA WHITMAN (50s) enter

A boisterous man at war with his mind-- Lear in the storm
A fierce queen of the home-- reminiscent of Lady Macbeth
Their FATHER and MOTHER bearing the same wrist tattoos
Bringing a present
OCTAVIA
Did you two start opening presents
without us

Cora jumps to her feet-- kicking the box behind her--

CORA
Oh no its nothing much just--

AUGUSTUS
Well I cant wait anymore-- Here

He shoves his PRESENT at Joan
She takes it-- but he wont let go

AUGUSTUS

Star and Id be lost without you

JOAN

OCTAVIA

AUGUSTUS

Joan tears the wrapping as

OUTSIDE the cloaked figures come halfway across the yard

INSIDE Joan opens the present to find
A white MASK with hands over the mouth-- THE SILENT ONE

JOAN

Blocking the door

Handing it to Augustus

AUGUSTUS

Augustus flicks his hand--
Two Kinsmen DRAG CORA AWAY-- out the door-- out of sight--

Octavia SLAPS Joan--
OCTAVIA
Today is the day you become a woman
Joan Marie Whitman Now kneel

Joan kneels

The Kinsmen HUM in unison

Circling Joan

Blindfolding her

Passing around a staff and two masks--

A mask with hands over ears for Augustus-- THE DEAF
A mask with hands over eyes for Octavia-- THE BLIND
Augustus SLAMS DOWN THE STAFF

The HIGH ELDER (60s) enters

Everyone bows their heads

He makes his way to Joan

Gaunt Long black robes A uniquely ornate mask of
Looming over Joans reddening face

HIGH ELDER
(low thick menacing)
Who kneels before the True Family

JOAN
A child who seeks her inheritance
the Three True Gifts

THE KINSMEN
True Sight True Hearing True Touch
the gifts of the powers of the mind

HIGH ELDER
Do you swear on your blood on the
blood of your father and of the first
fathers that you will hold sacred
and secret these Three True Gifts

JOAN
I s-swear

The High Elder unsheathes a DAGGER--

Joan hears it-- moves to flee--

Octavia and Augustus hold her down--

The High Elder raises the dagger--

Joan struggles and--

The High Elder cuts his own hand

The Kinsmen produce a BOWL to collect his blood

HIGH ELDER
You were a child who seeks Now you
are a woman who is found Drink

The bowl is handed to Joan
Joan swallows hard then sips the blood

ONE--
ONE--

crimson
The staff SLAMS down--
The Kinsmen take away the bowl-- rip off her blindfold--

HIGH ELDER
Rise Rise and take your rightful
place among us as the Keeper

The High Elder hands Joan her birthday gift mask

JOAN
High Elder what does the Keeper do

The High Elder points over to--
The Kinsmen dragging in A BLOODY BEATEN MAN
This is EMMETT 40s Brilliant Tough Half-dead

EMMETT
Please Im sorry

JOAN
Oh my-- Are you alright What-- What
happened to him Who is he

The Kinsmen pass around a photo of Emmett-- A PRESS BADGE--

HIGH ELDER
He is an Outsider A journalist

EMMETT

Emmett grabs onto Joan’s shoe--
Octavia kicks Emmett-- HARD-- shutting him up--

OCTAVIA
We caught him taking pictures of us
Writing about us

THE KINSMEN
The silence must be kept

JOAN
What do you want me to do

HIGH ELDER

THE KINSMEN
The silence must be kept

JOAN

OCTAVIA
Hush Youre a woman now Youll make
a fine Keeper just like your Father

JOAN
Father youve done this before
Youve killed people
AUGUSTUS
I kept this family safe Now you will
too
The Kinsmen HUM lay hands on one another

Revealing the same RUNIC TATTOOS on their wrists
Their left hands touching their left neighbor’s tattoo
Their right hands clasping their right neighbor’s throat

JOAN
What is this What are you doing

HIGH ELDER
Endowing you with your inheritance

THE KINSMEN
True Sight True Hearing True Touch
the gifts of the powers of the mind--
Seythra

A circle of hands link to touch the High Elder
As Augustus and Octavia lay hands on Joan
And Joan moves against her will

JOAN
What-- whats happening to me

Joan fights it but her hands reach out
Her left hand touches Emmetts wrist
Her right hand grabs Emmetts throat

JOAN
Stop Dont make me do this Please

THE KINSMEN
Blood of my blood Hand in my hand
Thoughts in my mind-- Drekka

The Kinsmen press thumbs into each others RUNIC TATTOOS
Both Joan and Emmett gasp rolling their eyes back as
A hazy image becomes SUPERIMPOSED OVER THEIR BODIES
Flashes of Emmett hugging HIS SON at graduation

More of his memories flit by

Making Emmett convulse

Each memory a paroxysm of pain

He spits up blood-- shaking-- dying--
JOAN
No

Joan snaps out of it--

Shoves Emmett away--

The hazy image vanishes--

Emmett catches his breath--

The High Elder grabs at Joan and--

JOAN
I said NO-- Hrinda

Joan slides her thumb between RUNES on her WRIST TATTOO--
Everyone FLIES BACK as if pushed by an invisible force--
They all stare in awe

OCTAVIA
Joan what are you doing

AUGUSTUS
Maybe shes right Maybe shes not
ready and we should--

HIGH ELDER
No She must finish the ceremony She
must empty the Outsiders mind or--

CREAK-- all heads turn--
Joan is already at the door-- camera in hand--
Suddenly sick-- her ears bleeding-- her health drained--

HIGH ELDER
Walk out that door and you are cast
out of the True Family

A beat

They step toward Joan--

She RUNS-- and for the first time WE MOVE--
Trucking back on Joan and following her out to--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Joan careens down the hall-- feverish-- off-balance--

She bolts out to--

Joan keeps running--
Disoriented-- lurching--
Pushing herself forward--
Clutching her camera--

CORA (0OS)

Her voice is cut off by--

A loud CRACK--

LIGHT FLASHING out of the house--

Joan doesn’t look back--

Uncontrollable tears streaming down her face--
Running and running and running and running and--

He slides over paperwork

Scouring the counter as--

BILLY (0OS)
Hey

A silhouette stands at the door--
Joan scrambles to find another exit--
The silhouette hits the lights to reveal--

BILLY 20s a gentle giant in new agey clothes

A man whos gone through hell and come back with clear eyes
He watches her

Sees something in her

And relaxes

He tidies up the store and puts down a NOVEL

HOLD on that novel American Warlock by Augustus Whitman

BILLY
Sorry I didnt see I had a customer

He turns his back on her

Going through a ring of keys

She watches him confused

He opens a case and takes out his most expensive items
Placing JOANS CAMERA in front of her

BILLY
Take whichever one youd like Free
thirty-day trial

She reaches for her camera--
Pulls her hand back--

BILLY
Its okay Ill be alright

She watches him unsure--
Then GRABS the camera--
Goes for the door--

BILLY (0S)
Wait a minute you forgot something

Joan turns back to see--

Billy taking out a professional CAMERA BAG

Packing it with batteries memory cards and a cleaning kit
He offers it to her

BILLY
If youre willing to risk your life
for a camera then you better take
good care of it Here

JOAN
Why Why are you doing this

He looks at her
Its like a warm hug without making a move

BILLY
Someone did the same thing for me
When I was homeless

JOAN
You were homeless
BILLY
My names Billy Whats yours
JOAN
Joan
BILLY
Joan Are you hungry Joan

INT DINER - NIGHT

Billy sips coffee sitting across from--
Joan wolfing down a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich

BILLY
Hit the spot

She nods chewing happily as--

DANA (0S)
Excuse me miss but is this man
bothering you

DANA 60s nudges Billy as she refreshes their coffees
Sporting a wry smirk an apron and a cane
Billy squeezes her arm Old pals

BILLY
Good to see you too Dana-- Dana Id
like you to meet Joan

DANA
Joan Good to meet you darling You
two heading to a meeting

Joan doesnt know what to say

BILLY
Well see-- But in the meantime
could you get us two slices of your
world-famous pumpkin pie

JOAN
Oh thank you but Im so full--

DANA
Then Ill box it up for you dear
dont you worry Back in a flash
(pointing at Billy)
And dont you bore her to tears with
one of your stories

Dana kisses Billy on the forehead and walks off
Leaning on her cane in a slow uneven gait
Joan and Billy smile at each other

JOAN
Well thank you so much Billy but I
should go I--

BILLY
Go where

Joan doesnt have an answer for that
BILLY

Do you have a place to stay A friend
you can call or maybe your family--

JOAN
NO I mean No
Joan tenses up
Her hands shaking
Looking around paranoid
BILLY
Hey Hey I didnt mean to pry

can stay as long as you like okay

Joan takes a deep breath
Looks Billy in the eye
No judgment in him

She nods

BILLY
Okay What do you want to talk about

She shrugs

BILLY
Want to hear how I first met Dana

DANA (0S)
(from the kitchen)
Billy what did I just tell you

Billy puts a hand over his mouth
Like a boy caught cursing
Joan smirks

JOAN
Its fine go ahead

BILLY
Ill make it quick-- I first met Dana
three years ago when I held her up at
gunpoint

That snaps Joan to attention

BILLY
I was drunk homeless and broke I
was yelling at Dana to open the
register when she took one look at
me and walked away A moment later
she came back with all the money in
the safe a steak dinner in a doggy
bag and the coat off her back

(MORE)

BILLY (contd)
The only reason Im not in jail right
now is because she sat me down in
this booth three years ago and she
gave me a choice I could go back out
there and drink until I die or I
could stay here sleep on a cot in
her back room and go to my first
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting

Dana returns serving up two plates of pie
Resting her hand on Joans shoulder

DANA
You have a choice too dear I
already have that cot set up for you

BILLY
Joan are you ready to stop drinking

Then buries her face into Dana crying hugging her
Finding refuge at last

Cora Cora

No response
Joan goes to the bunk bed

No one there

Tourist brochures with hand-written notes

She touches the notes moved

Squinting to see through her mask
She takes it off

And freezes in shock

No one in sight

But shes breathing fast

She cant take this--

She spins around and--

Slams into CORA

CORA
»do0an

The sisters stare

Joan looks over Coras prim attire
Cora looks over Joans disguise
Theyre years older

And worlds apart
Tears come to Joans eyes
She reaches for Cora--

JOAN
Cora its so good to--

CORA

JOAN
Im here to save you I have a car
out front we can finally--

CORA
(cold)
You didnt find me Im not here
Go away

Joan is blindsided
Cora goes to walk away--

JOAN
Wait Where are you going I came all

Cora advances on her-- fierce--

CORA
You came all this way for nothing
This is who I am now This is my
home Or did you forget that when you
ran off and--

A GROAN upstairs
Coras face slackens
Her eyes fix on the ceiling

CORA
You are not welcome here Go

JOAN
B-but Cora-- You invited me--

Joan shows her the invitation--
Cora SNATCHES it from her--

CORA
Where did you get this

MASON (0S)
We sent it to her honey Remember

MASON BLY 20s steps in with a candle and a handshake
A sunny upstanding boy next door

MASON

CORA
Did you invite her I told you--

MASON
Shes your sister You cant--

AUGUSTUS (0S)
Joan Joooooaniiie

That came from upstairs
Something wrong about his voice
Cora looks sick to her stomach
She turns on Joan--

CORA
You stay for dinner and thats it

A threat
Cora storms off

MASON
If you will excuse us for a--

Mason hurries after Cora

Violent whispers from another room
Joan slumps into the wall
Fighting a panic attack

JOAN
No no no no no no-- what have
done what have I--

FOOTSTEPS come closer--
That does it-- Joan flees into--

EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joan turns the corner--

Her mother OCTAVIA blocks the way out
Holding a candelabra in this dark passage
Eyes of granite locked on Joan

OCTAVIA
Dinner is served

Octavia turns around
Stands still

I

OCTAVIA
Oh and please do invite that man
waiting in the car to come join us

A chill runs down Joans spine

OCTAVIA
He is one of our kind is he not

Joan nods
Octavia walks away
Leaving us in darkness

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Joan enters with Billy

Throwing him a look of Follow My Fucking Lead

As they walk into a luxuriant Southern Gothic scene
Joans family sits at a dark feast-laden table
Candles flickering between five grim faces

All eyes on Joan and Billy

MASON gets up

MASON
We are so delighted you could join
us Please allow me to show you to
your seats Joan and dear Cousin

JOAN
Billy Cousin Billy

MASON
Right Thats right Here you are

Mason seats them at one end of the table
Name cards before them in calligraphy
Porcelain plates of sumptuous food
Sitting across from CORA AND MASON

MASON
How was your trip down here

JOAN
Fine Just fine

CORA
Although you wont be staying long

Before Joan can speak--
OCTAVIA

Cuts in sitting regal at the other end of the table--

OCTAVIA
Oh no And why is that Joan

CORA
Urgent matters with your photography
business-- isnt that right Joan

Joan squirms under their demanding gaze

JOAN
Th-thats right-- but I was just
thinking I could stay and photograph
the wedding-- as my gift to you

BILLY
Joan that is a beautiful--

OCTAVIA
This is a private affair We have no
need for any pictures

BILLY

But Joan is a talented photographer--
JOAN

Billy stop--
BILLY

Dont you want a keepsake Memories
fade but pictures last forever

CORA
Some memories never fade

Cora stares at Joan
Octavia stares at Billy
Nervous he goes to eat--

OCTAVIA
Not yet Cousin Billy Were waiting
for Augustus to join us

Octavia gives a swan-like nod to--
An empty armchair at the head of the table

OCTAVIA
Although I must admit this smells
extraordinary Thank you Sebastian

SEBASTIAN WILKES

Sits at Octavias side in chefs garb pouring her wine
A wiry man in his 20s with a loyal smile

SEBASTIAN
Anything for the Whitman family

OCTAVIA
So Cousin Billy how long have you
been dating my daughter

BILLY
Me No-- were not-- Im her spons--

JOAN
Were just friends Mother

OCTAVIA
And how did you two friends meet

BILLY
Well we first met when I caught her
breaking into my store--

OCTAVIA
Your store You dont work on your
familys land

JOAN
A feed store His family runs a co-
operative with others like us Billy
found me after I left and since
then hes helped me find my way

OCTAVIA
I see

She gazes at Joan
Dropping her hands under the table with a quiet whisper
And Joan hears Octavias INNER VOICE

OCTAVIA (VO)
What are you hiding from me Joan I
can tell when youre lying what--

Joan whispers back-- sliding her thumb over her tattoo and--
She blocks out Octavias inner voice

Octavia shifts her gaze to Billy

Listening for his thoughts

Hearing only silence

Joan presses her thumb deeper into her wrist tattoo when--

BILLY
So Cora Mason how did you meet

Joan seizes Billys hand
He throws her a confused look

As a small

fresh trickle of blood drips from Joans ear
LAVINIA BLY

CORA
Why Sebastian introduced us We were
having a hard time with the harvest
about three years ago

SEBASTIAN
Thats right Round then I lost
my parents and the Whitmans took me
in-- even though I was terrible with
the livestock Just terrible

OCTAVIA
But you are marvelous in the kitchen

SEBASTIAN
Only under your tutelage Octavia
But you still needed a hard-working
stable boy-- so I recommended Mason

MASON
Cora interviewed me and well she
scared the daylights out of me

CORA
I did not We Whitmans demand a high
threshold of rigor and I merely--

MASON
You see that She put the fear of the
First Fathers in me by Gods But I
guess I answered her questions right
or else I wouldnt be here

LAVINIA (0S)
Lets not forget the other reason
youre here Mason

Masons mother 40s sitting at his other side
A frail intense woman toying with her food

LAVINIA
You came looking for work because
your father passed bless his soul

MASON
Mother please not now Where was I

SEBASTIAN
Cora was gonna marry the stable boy

CORA
Sebastian hush I did not see him
that way not at first until I

was breaking in a new mare I thought
I had her under control when she ran
at full gallop for the trees I swear
I was going to die when Mason

appeared at my side on another horse
He calmed the mare down he saved our
lives and I knew right then that I--

Cora gazes into Masons eyes--
Taking his hand in hers--
Showing true joy when--

AUGUSTUS (0S)
Im here

AUGUSTUS

Lurches into the dining room

Straining from a recent stroke or trauma

Aided by the HIGH ELDER in his black robes and crimson mask
Everyone stands abruptly

The High Elder waves them all to sit

Everyone returns to their seats

Augustus settles into an armchair at the head of the table

AUGUSTUS
My girls All my girls are here

He reaches to Cora and Joan at his sides
Clasping both their hands

Fresh tears in his eyes

Sweet like that

The High Elder bows his head in prayer
They all follow suit

HIGH ELDER
Be present at our table O Father of
the First Fathers By thy blood
grant us that we may feast in
fellowship with thee Amen

EVERYONE
Amen

Everyone starts eating
Billy casts a look at Joan-- she ignores it

AUGUSTUS
Joan Its so good to see you Have
you come to stay with us at last
CORA

No Father Just for dinner
AUGUSTUS

Oh no Why cant she stay
OCTAVIA

You know perfectly well Augustus
AUGUSTUS

Why
HIGH ELDER

Must I remind you Augustus Whitman
what was done unto you the last time
she was here

The High Elder wraps his fingers around Augustus
Like claws sinking into prey
Augustus shakes his head

BILLY

Wait youre Augustus Whitman
AUGUSTUS

That I am
BILLY

You wrote American Warlock

(deathly silence)
Your novel is amazing How brave of
you to share your life story and how
brilliant using magic as a metaphor--

AUGUSTUS
That book was banned

BILLY
Sure but you can find it online

AUGUSTUS
On what

Billy looks around the table at blank faces
No one here has heard of the Internet

Joan shoots to her feet--

JOAN

MASON

The High Elder carries him off--

JOAN

BILLY

Octavia takes Joan away--
Everyone scatters--
And Billy is left alone

CRACK--
He stares at the empty dinner table
Noticing a SYMMETRICAL CRACK in every wine glass

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Octavia brings Joan into a corner--

OCTAVIA
Who is he
JOAN
H-Hes our cousin I told you--
OCTAVIA
Did you bring an Outsider into my
house
JOAN

No Mother I would never--

OCTAVIA
Does he know who we are

JOAN
Mother dont you trust--

OCTAVIA
Does he know who we are Seythra

And in the moment she speaks

Her thumb drags across her wrist tattoo

Her hair stands on her head

And every drawer in the kitchen slides open one inch

JOAN
He doesnt know-- I didnt tell him
a thing I-- I swear please dont--
OCTAVIA

I want you gone tonight

JOAN
But Mother--

An inaudible whisper--
A blur of Octavias hands--
All the drawers SLAM SHUT--

OCTAVIA
Is that clear

Joan manages a nod
Octavia storms off-- then stops

OCTAVIA

Your father sent the invitation

(beat)
I was against it but he hasnt been
well since he wrote that Gods awful
book and the High Elder crippled
him for it Your father thought if
you came home maybe hed get better
Maybe Cora could forgive you Maybe
we could be a family again

On Octavia hiding the sudden weariness on her face
Blood slowly trickling out of her ear

OCTAVIA
But you failed us again

Octavia walks out--
Joan goes after her--

Octavia slides a thumb down her wrist-- whispering and--
The door SLAMS in Joans face

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Octavia leans against the other side of the door
Then drops to the floor a sweaty mess

CORA (0S)
Mother what did you do

Cora appears and helps Octavia to her feet

CORA
You pushed yourself too far

OCTAVIA
No It was you

Octavia shoves her away
Staggering off by herself

OCTAVIA
You pushed this family too far

Cora watches her go biting her tongue

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Joan tiptoes down the dark hall searching

JOAN
Billy Billy
Her footsteps slow
Faint SOBBING nearby
She follows it to--

EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Joan comes to a screen door to find
A man sitting on the porch with a glass of whiskey

JOAN
Billy Is that--

The man turns-—

Its MASON

Jumping up

Wiping away tears

Hiding it all with a smile

MASON
Joan Hey Sorry I was just getting
a breath of fresh air and I uh
(voice cracking)
Who am I kidding

He sits back down and knocks back whiskey
Joan watches him deciding

Steps outside

Sits with him

JOAN
You sure you want to marry into this
crazy family

That makes him laugh

He offers the glass

She stares at the whiskey
Stares at it too long

Then shakes her head

A beat

He goes to talk stops himself--

JOAN
Go ahead Say it

MASON
Did Cora tell you how long I spent
planning that dinner
(off her reaction)
A month Thirty days of going over
the linens the seating arrangement
the menu-- and this is embarrassing--

He takes out index cards from his jacket

crying

MASON
I made Dinner Conversation flash
cards
JOAN
(smiling)
No

MASON
I researched everyones hobbies and
wrote them down see Heres you--
travel and photography--

JOAN
Oh my Gods

MASON

families first met I wanted it to be
perfect but I ruined everything

JOAN
Mason honestly you didnt--

MASON
Yes I did I ruined Coras dreams of
a fairy tale wedding Now shell

He takes a long draw of whiskey
When Joan snorts

JOAN
Sorry-- Cora told you about her first
boyfriend right

MASON
(excited for gossip)
No
JOAN
Oh Well it didnt really count so I
shouldnt--
MASON

No now you have to tell me

JOAN
Okay okay So-- Our parents raised
us very strict No Outsider movies or
TV only True Family literature--

MASON

Joan holds a

JOAN
Right but when Cora was six she
crept into our Aunt Aurelias room

JOAN
And thought they were true stories
MASON
Nooo
JOAN

So naturally being the wise older
sister I was I told on her--

MASON

JOAN
And she ran away I looked all over
our land and I couldnt find her

Mason leans in his smile fading

Joan giggles

MASON

behind her hand--

JOAN

Father found her in a pumpkin patch
smacking a big fat pumpkin with a
stick He shouted at her Cora what
are you doing and she said--

(through laughter)
Im turning this pumpkin into a
carriage so I can go see my Prince
Charming

Joan tips over belly laughing
Mason cant help but laugh with her

MASON
She didnt

JOAN
She did And every harvest Id leave
a baby pumpkin on her pillow and tell
her to go have a nice date with her
boyfriend Prince Charming
MASON
My gods youre the worst sister

Mason keeps laughing
But his words struck a nerve with Joan
She gets up and heads inside

MASON
Hey Joan thank you

JOAN
You still sure you want to marry into
this family

He looks at Joan

MASON
Id do anything for Cora

They nod good night
Joan walks back inside

HOLD on Mason

Waiting

Then his face falls slack

He buries his head in his hands

And howls a MUTED SCREAM into his palms

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Joan rushes in--

JOAN
Billy There you are We need to

Billy is curled up in bed asleep
Joan sits beside him
Gently wakes him

JOAN

JOAN

We need to go Get dressed come on

BILLY
Now What time is it

JOAN

BILLY
Why what happened

JOAN
Ill tell you later Now get up--

She pulls his covers back--

He grabs her gloved hand--

She stops

Leaning over his shirtless body

Her long hair framing his face in curtains
A charged moment

BILLY
Im not going anywhere not until
you tell me what the hell is going on
with your family

That kills the moment

She storms off

Pacing

Fidgeting

Taking a deep breath
Walking back over to talk

JOAN
Billy I

Hes fast asleep
She marches over to her bed
Sits down furious

Whispers of INNER VOICES bubble up--
She rummages through her pockets--—
Whispers build into a murmur--

She pulls out her pill bottle--
Murmurs build into a cacophony--

She pops a BLUE PILL and--

The voices fade away

She sighs

Peace at last

Places the pill bottle on the night table
Leans back to rest her eyes for just a moment--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
Joans eyes flutter open on--

The empty night table
HER PILL BOTTLE IS GONE
44

She jumps out of bed
Looks all over the floor

JOAN
Shit shit shit

BILLY
Joan What is it

She looks to Billy waking up--
Sees warm sunlight streaking in through billowing curtains

TIME CARD Today

JOAN
Shit Billy get up You have to get

BILLY
Slow down Talk to me What--

She grabs his shoulders--

JOAN
If we dont leave now something bad
will happen to us We need to go--

BILLY
No Joan You need to stop running--

He puts a hand on her arm--

His fingertips brush her skin and--

A BRIEF FLASH OF IMAGES from the first scene--
Joan alone in the library--

Augustus barging in--

His rough hand grabbing Joan--

Joan jerks away from Billy--
Stopping the images
Billy gets out of bed

BILLY
Joan what just happened
She palms her mouth
BILLY

What was that

JOAN
Go to the car Youll be safe there
Wait for me there and I1ll--

She runs out--
INT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joan rushes forward--

Hits a CREAKING FLOORBOARD--

A GROAN from a nearby room--

She freezes

Hears snoring

Keeps moving

Navigating a minefield of old floorboards

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - BRIDAL SUITE - DAY

Joan opens the door to--

Flickering red candles everywhere

A bathtub full of milk and rose petals
CORA sits at a vanity

Brushing her hair

She notices Joan in the mirror

And continues brushing

Joan shuts the door

JOAN
Come with me
(no response)
Theyre asleep-- I still have a car
out front-- We can go wherever you
want but we have to go now
(no response)

Cora

CORA
Are you finished

JOAN
What

CORA

Youre finished You tried Now you
can leave

JOAN
Im not leaving without you

CORA
You left without me three years ago

She puts down her brush

Places it within an orderly arrangement of beauty supplies

Picks out a shimmering red ribbon
Starts braiding her hair with it
Joan steps toward her--

CORA
Now you walk in here and expect me to
run off with you Today of all days

JOAN
I tried coming back-- I tried many
times but every time they--

CORA
They named me The Keeper

Like a gut punch to Joan

JOAN
Cora I had no idea

CORA
The day you left The High Elder gave
me your mask and ordered me to finish
the ceremony

JOAN
-Did you kill that Outsider

CORA
I kept our family safe Year after
year I had to be the responsible one
while you traipsed around the globe--

JOAN
No I didnt I--

CORA
You were cast out declared an
Outsider and now you stand before
The Keeper of the True Family

Cora stands
Picks up THE KEEPERS MASK
Treads slowly toward Joan

JOAN
What are you doing

CORA
The silence must be kept Kala-Nipt

Cora slides a thumb across her wrist--

And Joan freezes on the spot--

Struggling to move-- but stuck in place--

Her hand inching A WRINKLED LETTER toward Cora--
JOAN
Wait I wrote this for you Tried
to sending it to you ever since--

Cora casts the letter aside--
CORA

A letter You think you can fix
everything with a letter

JOAN
Im sorry Please Dont empty my
mind I I cant bear to forget you

Cora raises her hands over Joan like twin weapons
Looks into Joans quivering eyes
Coras face softens

CORA
Do you want to make things right

JOAN
Yes Ill do anything I--

CORA
Then repent Stand before our kin
beg their forgiveness and declare
that I belong to the True Family now
Will you do that for me

JOAN
Cora I Cant we go back to the
way we used to be

Cora flinches
Somewhere between tears and rage
She lowers her hands

CORA
No-- Sveetha-nipt-hrinda-KAERR

Coras hands blur--
All the candles wink out at the same time as--
WHOOSH-- the door swings open-- HURLING JOAN OUT TO--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Joan tumbles out across the floor and-- SLAM--
The door is suddenly thrown shut

JOAN
Cora no--
Joan is moving again--
Twisting the knob--
But its locked--

JOAN
No Dont Please Cora Please

Joan knocks on the door when-- from outside--

BILLY (0S)
Joan

Joan turns around as
She hears people rousing out of bed from nearby rooms

BILLY (0S)
Joan where are you

She creeps back--
As fast as she can--
Stepping around old floorboards until--

BILLY (0S)
Joan

She looks up

A RED ROBE flits past a window--
And the INNER VOICES return--
Joan books it--

Fast and loud--

Careening down the hall--
Heading for the front door--
INNER VOICES rising--

THEN SHE TURNS INTO--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Joan scours the room--

Searching the night table--

Tearing the bed apart--

INNER VOICES overwhelming her--
Fuck it--

She races out of there--

Grabbing her camera on her way to--

EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - DAY
Joan sprints outside--

INNER VOICES dogging her--
Billys car just a few feet away but--

JOAN
Billy BILLY

Billy is nowhere to be seen--
INNER VOICES crescendoing--

She jumps in the car--

Checks her pockets--

Finds the keys in the ignition--
How in the hell--

INNER VOICES almost deafen her--
She turns the key--

VROOM --

Ready to drive off when--

A ROUGH INNER VOICE cuts through everything--

ROUGH INNER VOICE (0S)
Kill them Kill them all

Joan stops
Looks at the house

ROUGH INNER VOICE (0S)
And save the bride for last

Joan exits the car
Faces the house
Clutching her camera
And goes back inside

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

No soul in sight

Joan creeps in

Shallow breaths

CAMERA shaking in her hands

Listening to the inner voices

ROUGH TONES rising as she approaches--—

INTERCUT - DOOR TO KITCHEN HALLWAY

A vertical line of sight through a doorjamb
Two figures whispering in the kitchen
SEBASTIAN is the one facing us

Joan watches fidgeting with her camera

He hits someone--

HANDS shove him back--

He slips--

His neck hits a granite counter and--
CRACK

Sebastian hits the floor DEAD

Silence so quiet we hear a pin drop
Then movement in the kitchen

Joan panics-- steps back--

AN ANGRY EYE APPEARS AT THE DOOR JAMB--

JOAN
Runs for her life--
Banging on doors--

Yanking on locked doorknobs--

Reaches the end of the hall--
Slams her fists on the last door--

Standing before her in formal clothes with his arm out
The hall is empty behind him

Joan shudders relief

JOAN
Father thank gods

He takes her arm
Guides her away

JOAN

A NOISE DOWN THE HALL

The kitchen door is wide open
Joan raises a finger to her lips
Leads Billy down the hall
Holding her breath

Creeping into--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Joan inches in to find--

The kitchen appears spotless
Sebastians body is gone

She scours the place

Hold on A LAPEL PIN on the counter that they do not find

JOAN

No no no he was here I saw him
BILLY

Saw who
JOAN

Sebastian The Chef He was

She cocks her head
Listening to something faint

BILLY
He was what Joan

She raises a hand
She hears WEDDING MUSIC now

EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

A sunlit arch of roses

Mason stands in a dashing tux

Cora in a breathtaking gown

True love in their tear-rimmed eyes

THE HIGH ELDER presides over them in his mask and robes
As a gramophone plays an old record

A fairy tale wedding indeed

HIGH ELDER
will now say their vows

Cora and Mason fasten their hands in the medieval fashion

CORA
You cannot possess me for I belong to
myself

MASON

But while we both wish it I give you
all that is mine

CORA
You cannot command me for I ama free
person

MASON

But I shall serve you in all the ways
you require

Joan and Billy rush out to witness--

CORA AND MASON
You are blood of my blood hand in my
hand thoughts in my mind I give you
my body that we two may be one I
give you my spirit til our life is
done This I vow and thee I wed

HIGH ELDER
You may seal the pact with a kiss

Everyone applauds--
Cora and Mason lean in for a kiss--

JOAN
Wait

Everyone stops

Staring at Joan

Silence

They all move to the arch
They all pose for a picture
Joan freezes

One of them is the killer
She goes to speak--

All eyes on her--

She hesitates--

Panics--

And just takes the picture
CLICK

On her numb face as--

HIGH ELDER (0S)
I now pronounce you husband and wife

OFF SCREEN applause
All sound fades
All we hear is Joans shaky breathing

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER

Joan sits at a table
Wearing the same numb expression
As everyone else drinks and mingles at other tables

BILLY (0S)
Well

Joan looks up
Billy has been sitting with her

BILLY
Are we safe here Can we stay

Joan looks across the tables at Cora
Laughing in her wedding dress
Holding hands with Mason

So happy

BILLY
If you dont want to face your family
alone I can do it with you We can--

JOAN
We cant stay You cant stay

Joan grabs him by his sleeve--

Taking him off to--

EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY
Joan trudges to the car with Billy in tow

Carrying her camera with her everywhere
She opens the drivers side door
JOAN
Get in Go home When this is over
Ill find my way back--

BILLY
Joan I cant--

JOAN
You have to Trust me--

BILLY
No look--

Billy lifts the hood of the car
The engine is a mess
Lines have been cut

BILLY
I tried to start the car this morning
but it wouldnt go Joan I-- I think
someone tampered with it

Joan looks down
A STEAK KNIFE sticks out of the front tire
Her mind races a mile a minute

BILLY
There is something very wrong here
Let me help you I can talk to your
family I can find out who is--

JOAN
Give me your phone

BILLY
What why--

JOAN
I dont have a phone Just give me--

She rummages through his pockets--
Takes his phone-- dials--

911 OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)
Nine-one-one whats the nature of
your emergency

She looks at Billy-- Can she trust him

BILLY
Joan I can help--

She marches into the house
Cant deal with him right now

Billy watches her go
Exhales a sigh
Doesnt know what to do when--

AUGUSTUS (0OS)
Hey you

Augustus stands by the back of the house
Wiping his dirty hands with a towel

AUGUSTUS
Gimme a hand with this

Augustus walks around a corner
Billy makes a decision
And goes after him

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

AUGUSTUS and BILLY work back to back

Billy serves food fresh out of the oven and onto plates

Augustus washes something at the sink
Scrubbing grime off his hands
As Billy finds A LAPEL PIN

BILLY
Happy to help Mister Whitman-- say
have you seen Sebastian

Billy watches Augustus from behind
Augustus stares at the wall
Water running

BILLY
I havent seen Sebastian all day and
I thought hed be here Do you know
where he is Mister Whitman

Augustus doesnt move
Water still running
Billy is about to tap his shoulder--

AUGUSTUS
Womens work

BILLY
What

Augustus goes back to scrubbing pots
Then scrubbing his hands
Scrubbing them raw

AUGUSTUS
Thats what she wants Told me to
stay in the kitchen Cook Clean Do
nothing but womens work All because
I wrote that book

BILLY
You mean American Warlock Id love
to hear about

Billy sees the fear in Augustus eyes
Like a boy about to get a spanking

AUGUSTUS
Im not supposed to talk about that

Billy looks around
Steps in closer

BILLY

Its okay Mister Whitman This stays
between us No one else will know

Their eyes meet
Augustus inhales sharply
Lets out a ragged breath

And whispers

AUGUSTUS
Its not a novel Its my diary

As Billy digests this we PRE-LAP--
911 OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)

OCTAVIA (0S)
I was wondering what had become of
you

Joan spins--
Hiding the phone behind her back as--

OCTAVIA

Lets herself in
Making Joan back into a wall
Muffling the phone behind her

OCTAVIA
With whom were you speaking just now

JOAN
With myself

As Octavia levels an acute gaze
Her hands going to her wrists with a whisper
Her inner voice rising in a sea of questions
OCTAVIA (VO)
You dont have to lie to me child--
What are you hiding-- Who were you--

JOAN
Mother stop

Joans voice rattles the room--

Sending a subtle gust of wind through Octavias hair--
Octavia grins

Sits on a bed and takes out her purse

Pulling out a compact and a handkerchief

OCTAVIA
Why are you here

JOAN
I uh-- Car trouble The car wont--

OCTAVIA
No Youre not hearing me Why-- when
you could be surfing at the beach
drinking at bars or going to rock
n roll show-- why are you here

JOAN
-How do you know about rock music

OCTAVIA
Same as you I was young and foolish

Octavia dabs at the flop sweat now beading on her face

Cleans the fresh blood trickling from her ears
Applies make-up to hide her sudden fatigue

OCTAVIA
Before I met your father I thought
it would be fun to go into the city

She snaps her compact shut

OCTAVIA
When I came back I found the Council
of Elders had slaughtered my parents
and siblings for my insubordination

Joan gasps
Octavia rises to her feet
Wobbling as she advances on Joan

OCTAVIA
When you left us I fought with all
the power within me just to keep this
family alive day after day and

She grabs Joan by the shoulders
Octavias immaculate face stained by tears

OCTAVIA
It was all worth it knowing you were
happy That you were out there living
your life So why are you here

Joan doesnt know what to say
Then it comes effortlessly

JOAN
Im here for my sister

Joan grabs her CAMERA off a table

JOAN
Im here to photograph my sisters
wedding starting with you

Joan marches off

Octavia follows her curious

CRANE DOWN to show Billys phone left under a pillow
The 911 call still going

911 OPERATOR (OVER PHONE)
Maam You still there Please stay
with us police are on their way

The SCORE rises--

CLICK CLICK SNAP--

The rhythm of a camera wheel turning--

The drumbeat of a camera shutter firing--

The music of camera gears building and taking us to--

MONTAGE - JOAN SHOOTING WEDDING PHOTOS
SUBJECT 1) OCTAVIA - IN THE DINING ROOM
Joan sweeps in with her camera and Octavia--

OCTAVIA
Here So far away from--

JOAN
There

Joan points at the head of the table
Glowing with warm curtained light
Octavia sits in her armchair

A queen on her throne

OCTAVIA
Like this

SUBJECT 2) MASON - AT THE BRIDAL TABLE

Joan orbits Mason with her camera

Finding the right angle out of the sun
Framing Masons face in both light and shadow

MASON

Arms crossed over a full plate

Casting hard light on Augustus alone at the sink

AUGUSTUS

Joan presses a palm into his chest
Taking control

JOAN

SUBJECT 1) OCTAVIA - IN THE DINING ROOM

Joan circles Octavia--
Adjusting her camera settings--

OCTAVIA

Octavia squirms--
Joan SHOVES her back into her seat--

JOAN
Dont move

Octavia nods
Power shifts

SUBJECT 2) MASON - AT THE BRIDAL TABLE
Mason sweats in the suns glare

Goes to wipe his brow--

Joan SWATS his hand down--

GRABS his chin and looks him in the eye

JOAN
Like a statue Got it

Mason makes the tiniest nod

JOAN
Now Im going to ask you a question

SUBJECT 3) LAVINIA - AT A BACK TABLE
Lavinia rolls her eyes--

YANKS Lavinia in closer--
Getting her attention--

SUBJECT 4) AUGUSTUS - IN THE KITCHEN

Augustus stands rigidly still
Clenching his fists like a boy holding his breath

JOAN
Ready
He blinks an okay
Joan frames up--
Gets into position--
Finger on the shutter and--
JOAN

Are you planning to kill Cora
INTERCUT - ALL FOUR SUBJECTS REACTIONS

A wave of emotions hits all four--
Too fast to catch them but--
SNAP-- SNAP-- SNAP-- SNAP--
Joan captures all their reactions

SUBJECT 1) OCTAVIA - IN THE DINING ROOM
Octavia stands bolt upright--

OCTAVIA
How could you ask such an impudent--

She marches at Joan--
Gets right in her face--
Joan braces for violence--
OCTAVIA
The only one here heartless enough to
get Cora killed is you
And Octavia storms out--

SUBJECT 2) MASON - AT THE BRIDAL TABLE

Mason stares right back at Joan
His face a blank slate

JOAN
I would never hurt Cora

SUBJECT 3) LAVINIA - AT A BACK TABLE
Lavinia shrugs cuts up her food--
LAVINIA

SUBJECT 4) AUGUSTUS - IN THE KITCHEN

SMASH-- Augustus sweeps plates to the floor--
Putting his back to Joan--
AUGUSTUS
No NO What makes you think I would
ever do that Answer me
JOAN
I I was just--
He turns to face her
His cheeks wet with tears
AUGUSTUS

Everything Ive done I did it for
you girls I wrote that blasted book
hoping youd read it and come home I
did other things terrible things

JOAN
What did you do Father

AUGUSTUS
Youre my compass Joanie Youre my
North Star I was lost without you

He pulls Joan into a hug
Caressing her hair

AUGUSTUS
And now youre home

On Joans concerned face we END INTERCUT

EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

Everyone having a wonderful time
Laughing Drinking Dancing
Except for JOAN

Sitting alone

Fixated on--

HER CAMERA

Sliding through PHOTOS
A wedding portrait of each subject
Octavia Mason Lavinia Augustus
All of them look GUILTY

JOAN

Drops her camera on the table
Running fingers through her hair
Frustrated

Until

She picks up her camera again
Eyes widening at--

HER CAMERA - A VIDEO FILE

She hits play

A low angle on her feet walking

Footage taken by accident--

When the angle tilts up--

Peering into the kitchen--

Revealing Sebastians murder

The final frame his fingers reaching for A LAPEL

JOAN

Watches in horror
Hand over her mouth when--

PIN

INNER VOICES bubble up--

She spins in her seat--

Seeing a carousel of cruel eyes watching her--
Victous whispers coming from all around her--
Getting louder-- angrier-- SCREAMING--

She holds her throbbing head--

Spots a WINE BOTTLE at her table--

A moments hesitation--

She GRABS IT--

Pours a glass--

Knocks it back--

Down in one--

Wincting as--

The voices fade

She exhales

Then the shame hits her

She grabs the bottle again
Shaky hands pour another glass
Goes to knock it back--

As her eyes meet--

OCTAVIA

At the next table

Wearing a similar dress

Wearing a similar expression of shame
Holding a similarly full glass of wine

The mirror image of Joan as an older woman

OCTAVIA
You cant escape who you are Joan

Theres no use in fighting your fate

Octavia sips her wine
Sways to her feet drunk
And joins the party

JOAN

Breathes hard Fast Hyper-ventilating
Glass of wine shaking in her hand

She raises it to her lips--

A HAND grabs her shoulder--

BILLY (0S)
Joan stop

BILLY
Sits beside her

Lets go of her shoulder
Leaves the choice up to her

BILLY
Dont throw away three years of

sobriety Dont throw away your life

JOAN
Billy I oh Gods

BILLY
Stop Dont fall down that spiral
Youre okay Youre with me But I
need you to come clean

He reaches into his coat
Pulls out JOANS PILL BOTTLE

BILLY
How long have you been taking these

JOAN
My pills-- Where did you--

BILLY
How long have you been using How
long have you been lying to me

Her eyes widen

She touches his jacket

Pulls something off of it
THE LAPEL PIN FROM THE VIDEO

JOAN
Where did you get this

BILLY
I found it in the kitchen But dont
you change the subject on--

Joan shoots to her feet
Backing away from him
Billy follows her

JOAN
It was you

BILLY
What

JOAN

You killed Sebastian Youre trying
to kill my family

BILLY
What are you talking about

JOAN
Thats why you came here-- Why you
kept disappearing--

BILLY
Joan youre not making sense I
think you need to sit back--

JOAN
Where were you this morning

BILLY
I-- I went to the car like you--
JOAN
Liar You werent at the car when I
got there
BILLY
I was looking for you but--
JOAN
Prove it
BILLY

JOAN

Syna-GETH

Joan LUNGES at him--
Whipping off a glove--
Touching her wrists then his face and--

INT PAWN SHOP - BILLYS MIND - NIGHT

Joan touches Billys face in his shop
Only this place looks surreal now
Everything cranked up brighter

Joan lets go

Gazing around

As Billy freaks out

BILLY
What th-- How-- Wait this cant be
my shop Where are we

JOAN
Your mind Now show me where you were
this morning

BILLY
Show you I dont know how to--

She pushes past him
Because playing over the wall behind him is a

PROJECTION - BILLY OUTSIDE THE WHITMAN HOUSE

Billy in the car

Turning it over

The engine whirring and dying
Getting out and popping the hood
Hearing something

Looking into the forest

A KINSMAN stares back at him

Billy sprints

Into the house

Into the library with Joan and Augustus
And that scene repeats on the wall

JOAN
You didnt kill anyone You were
telling the truth

BILLY
Of course I was I would never do
anything to hurt you

Then all the images on the wall change to
PROJECTIONS - BILLY LOOKING AT JOAN

Alternate takes of every scene with Billy
Every moment Joan looked away from him
But now we hold on Billy watching her

A tender longing in his eyes

JOAN
Because you love me

BILLY
No I-- I never said-- you werent
supposed to see any of this

Billy tries to block the projections
But the images play over his body
Joan cant help but smile

JOAN
Why didnt you tell me

BILLY
Im your sponsor I cant date you
Not yet

JOAN

Not until I finish all twelve steps

BILLY
Not until you to open up to me
Joan who are you

JOAN

What do you mean

BILLY
I mean what is all this Since when
could you do this And what happened
between you and your sister

JOAN
I-- Im not allowed to talk about--

BILLY
I have been patient I have told you
everything about my past but you
havent told me a thing about your

CREAK
They both look at
A door opening to

AN ADJOINING ROOM - BILLYS CHILDHOOD MEMORY

The back of Billys shop transformed into a 90s bedroom
A boy watches TV there LITTLE BILLY BILLYS FATHER (40s) shambles in drunk

Keeping his back to us

BILLYS FATHER
Billy Whyre you still up Bed Now

LITTLE BILLY
But--

A SLAP across the boys face

BILLYS FATHER
Do as youre told

He grabs Little Billy
Wrenching him off screen as
WE PUSH IN ON the empty door frame

BILLYS FATHER (0S)
You cant sleep in that Off Off

LITTLE BILLY (0S)
Dad please dont-- ACK--

BILLYS FATHER (0S)
Dont speak
Choking noises
Billys clothes are thrown across the room
His underwear lands in front of us

BILLYS FATHER (0S)
Shh dont speak Dont you ever--
EVER Do you hear me Do you--

BILLY

Slams the door on his childhood memory
Shaking crying

JOAN
Billy I didnt mean for that to
happen I didnt know--

BILLY
I told you didnt I I told you that
he abused me
JOAN
I didnt know he I am so sorry
BILLY

Now you know Now you know everything
about me So why cant you be honest
with me

JOAN
I-- I cant--

BILLY
Try

She shudders

Steps forward

Looks into his comforting eyes

Touches his face and A BRIEF FLASH
Billy steps back blinking rapid-fire at

PROJECTIONS - THE FIRST SCENE

Joans flight from her family flickers over every wall

Different moments playing on different walls

BILLY
Oh my god Joan

JOAN
I dont know what to do I never
shouldve left I never shouldve
come back or brought you here or done
any of this

BILLY
No Joan--

He takes her hands
His face in beatific wonder

BILLY
This ability this is a gift

JOAN
What No This ruined my life This
is why I ran away why I drank why--

BILLY
This can help so many people

JOAN
This will get me killed It will get
both of us-- all of us--

Billy turns and marches into
THE ADJOINING ROOM - BILLYS CHILDHOOD MEMORY

BILLY
Hey HEY You get away from him

BILLYS FATHER (0S)
What the--

Billy lunges off screen
WE HOLD ON the empty door frame
Sounds of a scuffle CRACK his father groaning

BILLY (0OS)
I never want to see you again you
got that SAY IT

BILLYS FATHER (0S)
Youre never going to see me again

The sound of a decisive blow
Then out comes

BILLY

Holding LITTLE BILLY in his arms
Rescuing his inner child
Tear-rimmed eyes on Joan

BILLY
This is how you help people This is
how you help your sister And were
going to do it together

Billy reaches out
Little Billy does too
Joan takes both their hands as it all FLASHES TO WHITE

EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - BACK YARD - REALITY - DAY

Joan lets go of Billys face
No time has passed here
Until their eyes open

A look from Billy

A nod from Joan

She turns to--

CORA - AT THE BRIDAL TABLE

Fifty feet away spoon-feeding Mason
Booping him on the nose with food
Making each other laugh

As THE HIGH ELDER watches over them
Keeping an eye on--

JOAN

Coming their way

Walking fast

Passing other tables--

Rousing judgmental stares when--

INNER VOICES rise up

Victous thoughts ready to overwhelm her

But this time she locks her sights on Cora
Everything else falls out of focus as she whispers
Swiping her thumb across her wrist tattoo and

The inner voices fade away
We hear only her heartbeat
And one looping thought

JOAN (VO)
Im coming back for you Im coming
back for you Im coming back for
you Im coming back for you

Joan marches

Suddenly weary

Breaking out in a sweat

Blood dripping from her ears

Not giving a fuck and pressing on
Just a few feet away from Cora
Reaching out to touch her as--

THE HIGH ELDER

PULLS Joan away--
Lifts up a glass--
CLINKING it and--

All sound returns
All attention on The High Elder and Joan
Her moment ruined

HIGH ELDER
The time has come to celebrate this
union with a toast-- but first-- Joan
must be on her way
(cutting Joan off)
Yes urgent business takes her away
so say your farewells while you can

Joan looks around
Stony faces stare back
Cora wont look at her
No one says goodbye
Joan walks off

HIGH ELDER
Now raise your glasses to--

CLINKING
All heads to turn to--

JOAN

Tapping her own glass with a knife
All cleaned up and smiling

Facing a tough audience

Holding up the PIN

JOAN
Public service announcement Who left
this pin in the kitchen Anyone

She scans the party--
Catches movement at a back table--
But her vision is blurring in and out--

HIGH ELDER
Child its time for you to--

JOAN
Id like to make a toast To my
sister on her wedding day

She raises a glass
No one else does

JOAN (contd)

Cora I remember the day you were
born I remember holding you in my
arms and never wanting to let you go
I told you stories I gave you my
toys-- Mother said you were too young
for all that-- but I said Thats
okay Ill teach her everything

A few chuckles
Cora starts to smile

JOAN
From that day on I always had you by
my side I took you to school with
me I took you to harvest with me We
shared the same room for fifty years
and I wouldnt have wished for it any
other way You were my best friend
my constant companion and I never
wanted to let you go but

Joan fights back tears
Everyone is listening
Cora is leaning in

JOAN
But here is this handsome man by your
side who loves you-- he loves you so
much he married you even after he met
all of us--

Now they all laugh
Cora brushes away tears with a giggle

JOAN
So I have nothing more to teach you
I guess I have to let you go now
Heres to Cora and Mason--

Joan raises her glass higher
Now everyone follows suit
Moved and grinning

Ready to toast--

JOAN
But one last thing Id like to say to
my newlywed sister and to all of you
I repent I beg your forgiveness for
all my wrongs And I declare

Joan looks at Cora
Takes a deep breath
Then this whole scene turns on a dime--

JOAN
Someone here is trying to kill Cora
Kill all of us I have proof I can--
THE HIGH ELDER

Grabs at Joan--

HIGH ELDER
That is enough No more--

Joan SHOVES him back--

JOAN
Get off me All of you listen--

AUGUSTUS - A FEW TABLES OVER
Rushes at Joan--

AUGUSTUS
Joan stop it Dont you disrespect--

JOAN
Father I can prove it I can show--

He SLAPS her
Shocking her--
And he drags Joan off her feet--

JOAN
Wait no-- Let me go You have to
believe-- Billy Help
BILLY - AT A BACK TABLE
Stands-- goes to run as--

OCTAVIA

GRABS Billys shoulder with an iron grip--
Sits him right back down--

OCTAVIA
Do not interfere

BILLY
He cant do this to her you cant--

OCTAVIA
She is our child and we do what we
want with our children

That strikes a fucking nerve with Billy as--
JOAN - DRAGGED BY AUGUSTUS
Sees Billy struggling with Octavia-- turns to face--
JOAN
Cora Talk to Billy He can prove it
HE CAN PROVE THEYRE TRYING TO KILL--

Augustus hauls her inside
Pained silence

CORA - AT THE BRIDAL TABLE
Really looking at everyone now
What tf Joan is right
She locks eyes with--
BILLY - AT THE BACK TABLE
Looking right back at her
Nodding Joan is right
As Cora reacts--
OCTAVIA
Have you any inkling what she was

raving about Cousin Billy

BILLY
Sorry

OCTAVIA
Can you really prove that someone
here is trying to kill us

Billy hesitates as--
They both turn to look at JOANS CAMERA in front of

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
Augustus drags Joan kicking and screaming--
JOAN
Let go of me Please Dont make me
go Dont send me away--

He THROWS her into a door--

AUGUSTUS
Im not making you go

JOAN
Youre not

AUGUSTUS
Im making you stay

He opens the door-- PUSHING Joan into--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
Augustus SLAMS the door on Joan as--

JOAN
No no no NO--

CLICK-- Joan yanks on the knob--
Shes locked in--

JOAN
No Let me out Open the door

INTERCUT - AUGUSTUS and JOAN

AUGUSTUS
Im not opening the door until you
come to your senses

JOAN
Please You have to protect Cora You
have to get her out of--

AUGUSTUS
No one is leaving this house you

dismantled your car

Horror dawns on Joan--
Turning back to see--
OILY TOOLS in the sink

JOAN
You did what

AUGUSTUS
I wont lose you again Youll stay
with us and well be a family again

Augustus tenderly puts his hand on the door--
Joan BANGS HER FISTS on the other side--

JOAN
NO Theyre going to kill her You
have to let me out You Father

On that silence we--

END INTERCUT - ON JOAN

Whipping around--

Seeing two more doors--
Rushing the first door--
Yanking on the knob--
Its locked--

Now the second door--
SWINGING IT OPEN AND--

Finding stairs that go down down down to a DARK BASEMENT
Fuck no

Going back to the first door
Noticing two SCREWS there
Rummaging through drawers

JOAN
Screwdriver screwdriver screwdriv--

FOOTSTEPS from down the hall

JOAN
Father Is that you

The footsteps stop
A shadow hangs over the door sill

JOAN
Billy Mother Could you please

WHAM-- someone rams into the door--
Joan screams-—

WHAM-- the door rattles again--
Joan searches all the cabinets--
WHAM-- the door begins to crack--
Joan finds a screwdriver--

WHAM-- the door’s frame splinters--
Joan rushes to the other door--
WHAM-- a door hinge pops off--

Joan starts unscrewing the other doors knob--
WHAM-- the other hinge pops off--
Joan almost finishes--

SHE DROPS THE SCREWDRIVER--

THE DOOR SLAMS OPEN--

Joan shrieks--
No options left--
She runs into--
INT WHITMAN HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

Joan descends the steps
Down down down

Into darkness

Pitch black

Eyes adjusting

Surfaces appearing

Her feet fumbling

Hands tracing the walls
Finding a switch
Flipping it

A BLINDING LIGHT BULB

Swinging over a concrete storm shelter
Joan squinting among stacks of dusty boxes
She searches for another way out
Finding only more boxes

FOOTSTEPS

Heavy and slow

Coming down the stairs

Joan panics

Crouches

Where the hell can she hide

FOOTSTEPS come closer

Then she finds it

Behind her

A CRAWLSPACE

Joan scoots in--

Pulling a box with her--

Covering up the crawlspace from sight--
When she looks over at--

SEBASTIAN

His DEAD BODY lies in the crawlspace beside her

JOAN - IN THE CRAWLSPACE

Gasps--

The FOOTSTEPS STOP

She slaps a hand over her mouth
Controls her breathing

Calms down

Peers around her box

Looking out at an empty basement
Silence

THEN HER BOX IS KICKED AWAY AND--

LAVINIA BLY
Masons mother steps into the light

Kneeling over Sebastians body
Sneering in disgust

JOAN
You Youre the--

Lavinia whips out a KNIFE and holds it to Joans throat
A spider toying with its prey

LAVINIA
Im going to enjoy gutting you

Lavinia drags the blades tip across Joans neck--
Drawing a bead of blood--
A MUFFLED MOAN--

LAVINIA
Dont be shy dear You got something
to say you come and tell her

Out of the shadows steps--
EMMETT BLY

The beaten journalist from the first scene
His face disfigured as if from a stroke
His hair a shock of white

His jaw locked shut

His crooked feet shambling

His shaky hands reaching out

Going through Joans pockets

And pulling out THE LAPEL PIN

LAVINIA
Oh dear you found it Here let me
get that for you

Lavinia sticks the pin on Emmetts lapel
Kisses his cheek

LAVINIA
There Now you look like your old
self back when you won the Pulitzer

JOAN
You-- Youre that journalist But I
thought they--

LAVINIA
Killed him No But you should have
The agony you put him through trying
to empty his mind-- but he didnt
forget We will never forgot

Emmett corners Joan--
Eyes blazing with fury--
Hands touching her face and FLASHING US TO--
EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - EMMETTS MIND - DAY

Moments after the first scene
Joan running and running
Only everything looks surreal now

Shimmering desaturated almost black and white

CORA (0OS)
Joan Dont leave me Joa-- No NO--
JOAN COME BACK PLEASE THEY RE--

This time her voice is cut off by a VIOLENT GASP--
Joan STOPS--

Turns around--

And runs back into--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - EMMETTS MIND - DAY
Joan twists down dark empty corridors--

Her feet slapping in disjointed echoes--

VIOLENT GASPS getting closer--

JOAN
Cora Cora what happened What--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - LIBRARY - EMMETTS MIND - DAY
Joan turns the corner to find--

Her parents on the floor DEAD
EMMETT HOLDING A KNIFE TO CORAS THROAT

JOAN

EMMETT
Do you know how long your sister
tortured me

JOAN
She never meant to hurt you She was
only trying to erase your--

It lasted fifty years Fifty years
imprisoned in my own mind

EMMETT
Now I have you here and Im going to
put you through the same hell

Emmett slits Coras throat

Joan CRIES OUT--

Cora falls-- bleeding--

Joan scoops Cora into her arms--
Watching Coras last gurgling breaths--
Hugging Cora tight as--

Joan finds herself hugging THE KEEPERS MASK--
Cora and Emmett have vanished

The room is empty

An infant WAILS

Joan goes to--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - BEDROOM - EMMETTS MIND - DAY

Joan stops in to see--

LITTLE JOAN same hair and clothes holding--
BABY CORA in her arms rocking her gently as--
OCTAVIA radiant and tired ltes in bed

LITTLE JOAN

(all in one breath)
Hi Im your sister Joan and Im going
to teach you to play hide and seek
and read you bedtime stories like
Snow White and Rose Red which is my
favorite story so lets read it
together Once upon a time--

As Little Joan sits down with a CHILDRENS STORYBOOK
Showing the pages to Baby Cora

OCTAVIA
Joanie shes too young for all that
Here give her back to--

LITTLE JOAN
Thats okay Ill teach her
everything Now Snow White and Rose
Red went for a walk in the woods

As our Joan smiles at this memory
EMMETT APPEARS behind Little Joan

JOAN

EMMETT
Fifty years

He swings down a KNIFE--
Joan SCREAMS--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - BRIDAL SUITE - REALITY - DAY

Coras empty room
Hold here for a beat

CORA (0S)
-back in just a minute

Cora walks in

Shuts the door

Looks around

Searching on top of dressers
Shuffling through papers until--
There-- on the floor-- she finds it--

A LETTER

Unfolding it to reveal shaky handwriting
This is Joans Letter

CORA

Reads it hand on her hip
When a change comes over her
Fresh tears spring to her eyes
She has to sit down

She reads it faster

Believing in Joan

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - EMMETTS MIND - DAY

WHAM-- Joan slams into a wall--

Exhausted-- years older-- streaks of white hair--
She plods on

Dead on her feet

Marching into--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - LIBRARY - EMMETTS MIND - DAY

Joan slumps into the door frame--
Resting to catch her breath--

He goes to slit her throat--
Joan SMASHES her fist into the wall--

The house vanishes

Nothing left but a black void

A spotlight hits Joan and Emmett
The tables have turned

JOAN

He turns to run--
And bumps into JOAN suddenly behind him--

JOAN
How are you going to do it

EMMETT
I-- I dont know I--

JOAN

A CIRCLE OF KINSMAN step out of the dark--
Surrounding Emmett--

JOAN
So tell me your plan or Ill make you

KINSMEN reach out for Emmett--
Swarming him--

JOAN

EMMETT
Poison Were using poison

The Kinsmen vanish into the dark

Two separate chemicals Tasteless
harmless-- but put them together--
(a sick grin spreads)
They should be enjoying it right now

JOAN
Enjoying what What did you poison
EMMETT

As Emmett laughs--
All this FLASHES TO WHITE--

Soars up the stairs--

Slamming out--

My parents dont know who you

MASON

Oh they did But Cora helped me
JOAN

No No she wouldnt have--
MASON

Cora lied about my past Cora blocked

JOAN
Youre lying She would never--

MASON
She did all that and more-- because
Cora is in love with me

JOAN

He wraps his arms around her--
Pulling her in for a closer dance--

MASON

Joan looks up at Billy

JOAN
How do I know you wont kill Cora as

Joan closes her eyes
His inner voices whisper
Warm resonant tones emanate

JOAN
Yes Youd do anything for her

MASON

He stops the dance
Half-bows to her

MASON
Three minutes

Mason walks off
Joan stands still breathless

EXT WHITMAN HOUSE - BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER
Joan hurries over--

LAUGHTER drowns out her words--
As she comes upon--

AT A BACK TABLE - BILLY AUGUSTUS AND OCTAVIA

Chuckling together like old friends
Talking over plates of CAKE

Billy squirms between Octavia and Augustus
Clearly their captive

The trio advances on Cora

Pulling the door closed behind them

WE HOLD on Cora as the door shuts over her face

Low whispers deciding her fate

The cloth is pulled away-- establishing us in--

INT WHITMAN HOUSE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Right back where we started

Moonlight cascades in from the window

Revealing their faces to show PERFECTLY ORDINARY

Looms over Joan in red robes
Her hands trembling

JOAN

Cora takes Joan by the hand
Lifts her up

forgiveness and declare that I

Joan swallows hard
Says it for Cora

I declare you now belong here

All the cake is put away
All the masks are put on
Because here comes--

Joan slides a thumb across her tattoo--

Dropping the dagger-- TOUCHING HIM--

Now everyone in the circle gasps--

Like an electrical current coursing out of Joan as--

A SPLIT-SECOND MONTAGE PLAYS OUT OVER THEIR WHITE MASKS--
Every moment of murderous conspiracy flitting by--

Joan releases the High Elder and--

They all step back

A Mexican standoff

One last beat of calm

rid of our parents
