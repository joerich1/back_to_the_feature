SONG BEGINS
The Sound of Musc

ALL CHILDDREN
THE HILLS ARE ALIVE
WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC
WITH SONGS THEY HAVE SUNG
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS
THE HILLS FILL MY HEART
WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC
MY HEART WANTS TO SING EVERY SONG IT HEARS
MY HEART WANTS TO BEAT LIKE THE WINGS

OF THE BIRDS THAT RISE FROM THE LAKE
TO THE TREES

MY HEART WANTS TO SIGH

LIKE A CHIME THAT FLIES

FROM A CHURCH ON A BREEZE

TO LAUGH LIKE A BROOK WHEN IT TRIPS AND FALLS
OVER STONES ON ITS WAY

TO SING THROUGH THE NIGHT

LIKE A LARK WHO IS LEARNING TO PRAY
I GO TO THE HILLS

WHEN MY HEART IS LONELY

I KNOW I WILL HEAR

WHAT I HEARD BEFORE

MY HEART WILL BE BLESSED

WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC

AND ILL SING ONCE MORE

At the end of the song they all
clap Slowly the children walk
towards their father Then they
run and they all hug Maria is
about to leave but the Captain
stops her

CAPTAIN VON TRAPP
